on iron wall brackets lit the passages deep
beneath the Tower, where Sheriam took them. The few doors they
passed were shut tight, some locked, some so cunningly worked that
they remained unseen until Egwene was right on top of them. Dark
openings marked most of the crossing hallways, while down others
she could only see the dim glow of distant lights spaced far apart.
She saw no other people. These were not places even Aes Sedai often
came. The air was neither cool nor warm, but she shivered anyway,
and at the same time felt sweat trickling down her back.</p>

<p>It was down here, in the depths of the White Tower,
that novices went through their last test before being raised to
Accepted. Or put out of the Tower, if they failed. Down here,
Accepted took the Three Oaths after passing their final test. No
one, she realized, had ever told her what happened to an Accepted
who failed. Down here, somewhere, was the room where the Tower&rsquo;s
few <em>angreal</em> and <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em> were kept, and the
places where the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> were stored. The Black Ajah
had struck at those storerooms. And if some of the Black Ajah were
lying in wait in one of those dark side corridors, if Sheriam were
leading them not to Mat, but to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She gave a squeak when the Aes Sedai stopped
suddenly, then colored when the others looked at her curiously. &ldquo;I
was thinking about the Black Ajah,&rdquo; she said weakly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not think of it,&rdquo; Sheriam said, and for once she
sounded like the Sheriam of old, kindly if firm. &ldquo;The Black Ajah
will not be your worry for years to come. You have what the rest of
us do not: time before you must deal with it. Much time, yet. When
we enter, stay against the wall and keep silent. You are allowed
here as a benevolence, to attend, not to distract or interfere.&rdquo;
She opened a door covered in gray metal worked to look like
stone.</p>

<p>The square room within was spacious, its pale stone
walls bare. The only furnishing was a long stone table draped with
a white cloth, in the middle of the room. Mat lay on that table,
fully clothed save for coat and boots, eyes closed and face so
gaunt that Egwene wanted to cry. His labored breathing made a
hoarse whistle. The Shadar Logoth dagger hung sheathed at his belt,
the ruby capping its hilt seeming to gather light, so it glowed
like some fierce red eye despite the illumination of a dozen lamps,
magnified by the pale walls and white-tiled floor.</p>

<p>The Amyrlin Seat stood at Mat&rsquo;s head, and Leane at
his feet. Four Aes Sedai stood down one side of the table, and
three down the other. Sheriam joined the three. One of them was
Verin. Egwene recognized Serafelle, another Brown sister, and
Alanna Mosvani, of the Green Ajah, and Anaiya, of the Blue, which
was Moiraine&rsquo;s Ajah.</p>

<p>Alanna and Anaiya had each taught her some of her
lessons in opening herself to the True Source, in how to surrender
to <em>saidar</em> in order to control it. And between her first
arrival in the White Tower and her departure, Anaiya must have
tested her fifty times to see if she was a Dreamer. The tests had
shown nothing one way or the other, but plain-faced, kindly Anaiya,
with that warm smile that was her only beauty, had kept calling her
back for more tests, as implacable as a boulder rolling
downhill.</p>

<p>The rest were unknown to her, except for one
cool-eyed woman she thought was a White. The Amyrlin and the Keeper
wore their stoles, of course, but none of the others had anything
to mark them out except Great Serpent rings and ageless Aes Sedai
faces. None of them acknowledged the presence of Egwene and the
other two by so much as a glance.</p>

<p>Despite the outward calm of the women around the
table, Egwene thought she saw signs of uncertainty. A tightness to
Anaiya&rsquo;s mouth. A slight frown on Alanna&rsquo;s darkly beautiful face.
The cool-eyed woman kept smoothing her pale blue dress over her
thighs without seeming to realize what she was doing.</p>

<p>An Aes Sedai Egwene did not know set a plain,
polished wooden box, long and narrow, on the table and opened it.
From its nest in the red silk lining, the Amyrlin took out a white,
fluted wand the length of her forearm. It could have been bone, or
ivory, but was neither. No one alive knew what it was made of.</p>

<p>Egwene had never seen the wand before, but she
recognized it from a lecture Anaiya had given the novices. One of
the few <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>, and perhaps the most powerful, that
the Tower possessed. <em>Sa&rsquo;angreal</em> had no power of their own,
of course&mdash;they were merely devices for focusing and
magnifying what an Aes Sedai could channel&mdash;but with that
wand, a strong Aes Sedai might be able to crumple the walls of Tar
Valon.</p>

<p>Egwene clutched Nynaeve&rsquo;s hand on one side and
Elayne&rsquo;s on the other. <em>Light! They&rsquo;re not sure they can Heal
him, even with a</em> sa&rsquo;angreal&mdash;<em>with</em> that
sa&rsquo;angreal! <em>What chance would we have had? We&rsquo;d probably have
killed him, and ourselves, too. Light!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;I will meld the flows,&rdquo; the Amyrlin said. &ldquo;Be
careful. The Power needed to break the bond with the dagger and
Heal its damage is very close to what could kill him. I will focus.
Attend.&rdquo; She held the wand straight out in front of her in both
hands, above Mat&rsquo;s face. Still unconscious, he shook his head and
tightened a fist on the dagger&rsquo;s hilt, muttering something that
sounded like a denial.</p>

<p>A glow appeared around each Aes Sedai, that soft,
white light that only a woman who could channel could see. Slowly
the lights spread, until that which seemed to emanate from one
woman touched that which came from the woman beside her, merged
with it, till there was only one light, a light that, to Egwene&rsquo;s
eyes, diminished the lamps to nothing. And in that brightness was a
stronger light still. A bar of bone-white fire. The <em>
sa&rsquo;angreal</em>.</p>

<p>Egwene fought the urge to open herself to <em>
saidar</em> and add her flow to the tide. It was a pull so strong
she was about to be jerked off her feet. Elayne tightened her hold
on her hand. Nynaeve took a step toward the table, then stopped
with an angry shake of her head. <em>Light</em>, Egwene thought,
<em>I could do it</em>. But she did not know what it was she could
do. <em>Light, it&rsquo;s too strong. It&rsquo;s so</em>&mdash;<em>
wonderful</em>. Elayne&rsquo;s hand was trembling.</p>

<p>On the table, Mat thrashed in the middle of the glow,
jerking this way, then that, muttering incomprehensibly. But he did
not loosen his hold on the dagger, and his eyes remained closed.
Slowly, ever so slowly, he began to arch his back, muscles
straining till he shook. Still he fought and bucked, until finally
only his heels and his shoulders touched the table. His hand on the
dagger sprang open and, quivering, crept back from the hilt; was
forced, fighting, from the hilt. His lips skinned away from his
teeth in a snarl, a grimace of pain, and his breath came in forced
grunts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are killing him,&rdquo; Egwene whispered. &ldquo;The
Amyrlin is killing him! We have to do something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just as softly, Nynaeve said, &ldquo;If we stop them&mdash;if we could stop them&mdash;he&rsquo;ll die. I do not think I could
handle half that much of the Power.&rdquo; She paused as if she had just
heard her own words&mdash;that she could channel half of what ten
full Aes Sedai did with a <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>&mdash;and her voice
grew even fainter. &ldquo;Light help me, I want to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She fell silent abruptly. Did she mean that she
wanted to help Mat, or that she wanted to channel that flow of
Power? Egwene could feel that urge in herself, like a song that
compelled her to dance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must trust them,&rdquo; Nynaeve said in an intense
whisper, finally. &ldquo;He has no other chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly Mat shouted, loud and strong. &ldquo;<em>Muad&rsquo;drin
tia dar allende caba&rsquo;drin rhadiem!</em>&rdquo; Arched and struggling,
eyes squeezed shut, he bellowed the words clearly. &ldquo;<em>Los Valdar
Cuebiyari! Los! Carai an Caldazar! Al Caldazar!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene frowned. She had learned enough to recognize
the Old Tongue, if not to understand more than a few words. <em>
Carai an Caldazar! Al Caldazar!</em> &ldquo;For the honor of the Red
Eagle! For the Red Eagle!&rdquo; Ancient battle cries of Manetheren, a
nation that had vanished during the Trolloc Wars. A nation that had
stood where the Two Rivers was now. That much, she knew; but in
some way it seemed for a moment that she should understand the
rest, too, as if the meaning were just out of sight, and all she
had to do was turn her head to know.</p>

<p>With a loud pop of tearing leather, the
golden-sheathed dagger rose from Mat&rsquo;s belt, hung a foot above his
straining body. The ruby glittered, seemed to send off crimson
sparks, as if it, too, fought the Healing.</p>

<p>Mat&rsquo;s eyes opened, and he glared at the women
standing around him. &ldquo;<em>Mia ayende, Aes Sedai! Caballein mirain
ye! Inde muagdhe Aes Sedai misain ye! Mia ayende!</em>&rdquo; And he
began to scream, a roar of rage that went on and on, till Egwene
wondered that he had breath left in him.</p>

<p>Hurriedly Anaiya bent to lift a dark metal box from
under the table, moving as if it were heavy. When she set it beside
Mat and opened the lid, only a small space was revealed within
sides at least two inches thick. Anaiya bent again for a set of
tongs such as a goodwife might use in her kitchen, and grasped the
floating dagger in them as carefully as if it were a poisonous
snake.</p>

<p>Mat&rsquo;s scream grew frantic. The ruby shone furiously,
flashing blood-red.</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai thrust the dagger into the box and
snapped the lid down, letting out a loud sigh as it clicked shut.
&ldquo;A filthy thing,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>As soon as the dagger was hidden, Mat&rsquo;s shriek cut
off, and he collapsed as if muscle and bone had turned to water. An
instant later the glow surrounding Aes Sedai and table winked
out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Done,&rdquo; the Amyrlin said hoarsely, as if she had been
the one screaming. &ldquo;It is done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some of the Aes Sedai sagged visibly, and sweat
beaded on more than one brow. Anaiya pulled a plain linen
handkerchief from her sleeve and wiped her face openly. The
cool-eyed White dabbed almost surreptitiously at her cheeks with a
bit of Lugard lace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fascinating,&rdquo; Verin said. &ldquo;That the Old Blood could
flow so strongly in anyone today.&rdquo; She and Serafelle put their
heads together, talking softly, but with many gestures.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he Healed?&rdquo; Nynaeve said. &ldquo;Will he&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;live?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat lay as if sleeping, but his face still had that
hollow-cheeked gauntness. Egwene had never heard of a Healing that
did not cure everything. <em>Unless just separating him from the
dagger took all of the Power they used. Light!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Brendas,&rdquo; the Amyrlin said, &ldquo;will you see that he is
taken back to his room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you command, Mother,&rdquo; the cool-eyed woman said,
her curtsy as emotionless as she herself seemed. When she left to
summon bearers, several of the other Aes Sedai left, too, including
Anaiya. Verin and Serafelle followed, still talking to one another
too quietly for Egwene to make out what they said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Mat all right?&rdquo; Nynaeve demanded. Sheriam raised
her eyebrows.</p>

<p>The Amyrlin Seat turned toward them. &ldquo;He is as well
as he can be,&rdquo; she said coldly. &ldquo;Only time will tell. Carrying
something with Shadar Logoth&rsquo;s taint for so long&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;who knows
what effect it will have on him? Perhaps none, perhaps much. We
will see. But the bond with the dagger is broken. Now he needs
rest, and as much food as can be gotten into him. He should
live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was that he was shouting, Mother?&rdquo; Elayne
asked, then hastily added, &ldquo;If I may ask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was ordering soldiers.&rdquo; The Amyrlin gave the
young man lying on the table a quizzical look. He had not moved
since collapsing, but Egwene thought his breathing seemed easier,
the rise and fall of his chest more rhythmic. &ldquo;In a battle two
thousand years gone, I would say. The Old Blood comes again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not all about a battle,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. &ldquo;I
heard him say Aes Sedai. That was no battle. Mother,&rdquo; she added
belatedly.</p>

<p>For a moment the Amyrlin seemed to consider, perhaps
what to say, perhaps whether to say anything. &ldquo;For a time,&rdquo; she
said finally, &ldquo;I believe the past and the present were one. He was
there, and he was here, and he knew who we were. He commanded us to
release him.&rdquo; She paused again. &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;I am a free man, Aes Sedai. I am
no Aes Sedai meat.&rsquo; That is what he said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leane sniffed loudly, and some of the other Aes Sedai
muttered angrily under their breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Mother,&rdquo; Egwene said, &ldquo;he could not have meant
it as it sounds. Manetheren was allied with Tar Valon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Manetheren was an ally, child,&rdquo; the Amyrlin told
her, &ldquo;but who can know the heart of a man? Not even he himself, I
suspect. A man is the easiest animal to put on a leash, and the
hardest to keep leashed. Even when he chooses it himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; Sheriam said, &ldquo;it is late. The cooks will
be waiting for these helpers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; Egwene asked anxiously, &ldquo;could we not stay
with Mat? If he may still die&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin&rsquo;s look was level, her face without
expression. &ldquo;You have chores to do, child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not scrubbing pots she meant. Egwene was sure
of that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mother.&rdquo; She curtsied, her skirts brushing
Nynaeve&rsquo;s and Elayne&rsquo;s as they made theirs. One last time she
looked at Mat, then followed Sheriam out. Mat had still not
moved.</p>
