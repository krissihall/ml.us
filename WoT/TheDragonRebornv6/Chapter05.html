<h4><em>Nightmares Walking</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">L</span>eaping
from his bed, Perrin snatched his axe and ran
outside, barefoot and wearing nothing but thin linen, heedless of
the cold. The moon bathed the clouds with pale white. More than
enough light for his eyes, more than enough to see the shapes
slipping through the trees from all sides, shapes almost as big as
Loial, but with faces distorted by muzzles and beaks, half-human
heads wearing horns and feathered crests, stealthy forms stalking
on hooves or paws as often as booted feet.</p>

<p>He opened his mouth to shout warning, and suddenly
the door of Moiraine&rsquo;s hut burst open and Lan dashed out, sword in
hand and shouting, &ldquo;Trollocs! Wake, for your lives! Trollocs!&rdquo;
Shouts answered him as men began to tumble from their huts, garbed
for sleep, which for most meant not at all, but with swords ready.
With a bestial roar, the Trollocs rushed forward to be met with
steel and cries of &ldquo;Shienar!&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Dragon
Reborn!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan was fully clothed&mdash;Perrin would have bet
the Warder had not slept&mdash;and he flung himself among the
Trollocs as if his wool were armor. He seemed to dance from one to
another, man and sword flowing like water or wind, and where the
Warder danced, Trollocs screamed and died.</p>

<p>Moiraine was out in the night as well, dancing her
own dance among the Trollocs. Her only apparent weapon was a
switch, but where she slashed a Trolloc, a line of flame grew on
its flesh. Her free hand threw fiery balls summoned from thin air,
and Trollocs howled as flames consumed them, thrashing on the
ground.</p>

<p>An entire tree burst into flame from root to crown,
then another, and another. Trollocs shrieked at the sudden light,
but they did not stop swinging their spiked axes and swords curved
like scythes.</p>

<p>Abruptly Perrin saw Leya step hesitantly out of
Moiraine&rsquo;s cabin, halfway around the bowl from him, and all thought
of anything else left him. The Tuatha&rsquo;an woman pressed her back
against the log wall, a hand to her throat. The light from the
burning trees showed him the pain and horror, the loathing on her
face as she watched the carnage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hide!&rdquo; Perrin shouted at her. &ldquo;Get back inside and
hide!&rdquo; The swelling roar of fighting and dying swallowed his words.
He ran toward her. &ldquo;Hide, Leya! For the love of the Light,
hide!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A Trolloc loomed up over him, a cruelly hooked beak
where its mouth and nose should have been. Black mail and spikes
covered it from shoulders to knees, and it moved on a hawk&rsquo;s talons
as it swung one of those strangely curved swords. It smelled of
sweat and dirt and blood.</p>

<p>Perrin crouched under the slash, shouting wordlessly
as he struck out with his axe. He knew he should have been afraid,
but urgency suppressed fear. All that mattered was that he had to
reach Leya, had to get her to safety, and the Trolloc was in the
way.</p>

<p>The Trolloc fell, roaring and kicking; Perrin did not
know where he had hit it, or if it were dying or merely hurt. He
leaped over it, where it lay thrashing, and ran scrambling up the
slope.</p>

<p>Burning trees cast lurid shadows across the small
valley. A flickering shadow beside Moiraine&rsquo;s hut suddenly resolved
into a Trolloc, goat-snouted and horned. Gripping a wildly spiked
axe with both hands, it seemed on the point of rushing down into
the fray when its eyes fell on Leya.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Perrin shouted. &ldquo;Light, no!&rdquo; Rocks skittered
away under his bare feet; he did not feel the bruises. The
Trolloc&rsquo;s axe rose. &ldquo;Leyaaaaaaaa!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the last instant the Trolloc spun, axe flashing
toward Perrin. He threw himself down, yelling as steel scored his
back. Desperately he flung out a hand, caught a goat hoof, and
pulled with all his strength. The Trolloc&rsquo;s feet came out from
under it, and it fell with a crash, but as it slid down the slope,
it seized Perrin in hands big enough to make two of his, pulling
him along to roll over and over. The stink of it filled his
nostrils, goat-stench and sour man-sweat. Massive arms snaked
around his chest, squeezing the air out; his ribs creaked on the
point of breaking. The Trolloc&rsquo;s axe was gone in the fall, but
blunt goat-teeth sank into Perrin&rsquo;s shoulder, powerful jaws
chewing. He groaned as pain jolted down his left arm. His lungs
labored for breath, and blackness crept in on the edges of his
vision, but dimly he was aware that his other arm was free, that
somehow he had held on to his own axe. He held it short on the
handle, like a hammer, with the spike foremost. With a roar that
took the last of his air, he drove the spike into the Trolloc&rsquo;s
temple. Soundlessly it convulsed, limbs flinging wide, hurling him
away. By instinct alone his hand tightened on the axe, ripping it
loose as the Trolloc slid further down the slope, still
twitching.</p>

<p>For a moment Perrin lay there, fighting for breach.
The gash across his back burned, and he felt the wetness of blood.
His shoulder protested as he pushed himself up. &ldquo;Leya?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was still there, huddled in front of the hut, not
more than ten paces upslope. And watching him with such a look on
her face that he could barely meet her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pity me!&rdquo; he growled at her. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Myrddraal&rsquo;s leap from the roof of the hut seemed
to take too long, and its dead black cloak hung during the slow
fall as if the Halfman were standing on the ground already. Its
eyeless gaze was fixed on Perrin. It smelled like death.</p>

<p>Cold seeped through Perrin&rsquo;s arms and legs as the
Myrddraal stared at him. His chest felt like a lump of ice. &ldquo;Leya,&rdquo;
he whispered. It was all he could do not to run. &ldquo;Leya, please
hide. Please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Halfman started toward him, slowly, confident
that fear held him in a snare. It moved like a snake, unlimbering a
sword so black only the burning trees made it visible. &ldquo;Cut one leg
of the tripod,&rdquo; it said softly, &ldquo;and all fall down.&rdquo; Its voice
sounded like dry-rotted leather crumbling.</p>

<p>Suddenly Leya moved, throwing herself forward,
attempting to wrap her arms around the Myrddraal&rsquo;s legs. It gave an
almost casual backwards swing of its dark sword, never even looking
around, and she crumpled.</p>

<p>Tears started in the corners of Perrin&rsquo;s eyes. <em>I
should have helped her</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>saved her. I should have
done</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>something!</em> But so long as the Myrddraal
stared at him with its eyeless gaze, it was an effort even to
think.</p>

<p><em>We come, brother. We come, Young Bull.</em></p>

<p>The words inside his mind made his head ring like a
struck bell; the reverberations shivered through him. With the
words came the wolves, scores of them, flooding into his mind as he
was aware of them flooding into the bowl-shaped valley. Mountain
wolves almost as tall as a man&rsquo;s waist, all white and gray, coming
out of the night at the run, aware of the two-legs&rsquo; surprise as
they darted in to take on the Twisted Ones. Wolves filled him till
he could barely remember being a man. His eyes gathered the light,
shining golden yellow. And the Halfman stopped its advance as if
suddenly uncertain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fade,&rdquo; Perrin said roughly, but then a different
name came to him, from the wolves. Trollocs, the Twisted Ones, made
during the War of the Shadow from melding men and animals, were bad
enough, but the Myrddraal&mdash;&ldquo;Neverborn!&rdquo; Young Bull
spat. Lip curling back in a snarl, he threw himself at the
Myrddraal.</p>

<p>It moved like a viper, sinuous and deadly, black
sword quick as lightning, but he was Young Bull. That was what the
wolves called him. Young Bull, with horns of steel that he wielded
with his hands. He was one with the wolves. He was a wolf, and any
wolf would die a hundred times over to see one of the Neverborn go
down. The Fade fell back before him, its darting blade now trying
to deflect his slashes.</p>

<p>Hamstring and throat, that was how wolves killed.
Young Bull suddenly threw himself to one side and dropped to a
knee, axe slicing across the back of the Halfman&rsquo;s knee. It
screamed&mdash;a bone-burrowing sound to raise his hair at any
other time&mdash;and fell, catching itself with one hand. The
Halfman&mdash;the Neverborn&mdash;still held its sword firmly,
but before it could set itself, Young Bull&rsquo;s axe struck again. Half
severed, the Myrddraal&rsquo;s head flopped over to hang down its back;
yet still leaning there on one hand, the Neverborn slashed wildly
with its sword. Neverborn were always long in dying.</p>

<p>From the wolves as much as his own eyes Young Bull
received impressions of Trollocs thrashing on the ground,
shrieking, untouched by wolf or man. Those would have been linked
to this Myrddraal, and would die when it did&mdash;if no one
killed them first.</p>

<p>The urge to rush down the slope and join his
brothers, join in killing the Twisted Ones, in hunting the
remaining Neverborn, was strong, but a buried fragment that was
still man remembered. <em>Leya</em>.</p>

<p>He dropped his axe and turned her over gently. Blood
covered her face, and her eyes stared up at him, glazed with death.
An accusing stare, it seemed to him. &ldquo;I tried,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;I
tried to save you.&rdquo; Her stare did not change. &ldquo;What else could I
have done? It would have killed you if I hadn&rsquo;t killed it!&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Come, Young Bull. Come kill the Twisted
Ones.</em></p>

<p>Wolf rolled over him, enveloped him. Letting Leya
back down, Perrin took up his axe, blade gleaming wetly. His eyes
shone as he raced down the rocky slope. He was Young Bull.</p>

<p>Trees scattered around the bowl-shaped valley burned
like torches; a tall pine flared into flame as Young Bull joined
the battle. The night air flashed actinic blue, like sheet
lightning, as Lan engaged another Myrddraal, ancient Aes Sedai-made
steel meeting black steel wrought in Thakan&rsquo;dar, in the shadow of
Shayol Ghul. Loial wielded a quarterstaff the size of a fence rail,
the whirling timber marking a space no Trolloc entered without
falling. Men fought desperately in the dancing shadows, but Young
Bull&mdash;Perrin&mdash;noted in a distant way that too many of
the Shienaran two-legs were down.</p>

<p>The brothers and sisters fought in small packs of
three or four, dodging scythe-like swords and spiked axes, darting
in with slashing teeth to sever hamstrings, lunging to bite out
throats as their prey fell. There was no honor in the way they
fought, no glory, no mercy. They had not come for battle, but to
kill. Young Bull joined one of the small packs, the blade of his
axe serving for teeth.</p>

<p>He no longer thought of the greater battle. There was
only the Trolloc he and the wolves&mdash;the brothers&mdash;cut
off from the rest and brought down. Then there would be another,
and another, and another, until none were left. None here, none
anywhere. He felt the urge to hurl the axe aside and use his teeth,
to run on all fours as his brothers did. Run through the high
mountain passes. Run belly-deep in powdery snow pursuing deer. Run,
with the cold wind ruffling his fur. He snarled with his brothers,
and Trollocs howled with fear at his yellow-eyed gaze even more
than they did at the other wolves.</p>

<p>Abruptly he realized there were no more Trollocs
standing anywhere in the bowl, though he could feel his brothers
pursuing others as they fled. A pack of seven had a different prey,
somewhere out there in the darkness. One of the Neverborn ran for
its hard-footed four-legs&mdash;<em>its horse</em>, a distant part of him
said&mdash;and his brothers followed, noses filled with its scent,
its essence of death. Inside his head, he was with them, seeing
with their eyes. As they closed in, the Neverborn turned, cursing,
black blade and black-clad Neverborn like part of the night. But
night was where his brothers and sisters hunted.</p>

<p>Young Bull snarled as the first brother died, its
death pain lancing him, yet the others closed in and more brothers
and sisters died, but snapping jaws dragged the Neverborn down. It
fought back with its own teeth now, ripping out throats, slashing
with fingernails that sliced skin and flesh like the hard claws the
two-legs carried, but brothers savaged it even as they died.
Finally a lone sister heaved herself out of the still-twitching
pile and staggered to one side. Morning Mist, she was called, but
as with all their names, it was more than that: a frosty morning
with the bite of snows yet to come already in the air, and the mist
curling thick across the valley, swirling with the sharp breeze
that carried the promise of good hunting. Raising her head, Morning
Mist howled to the cloud-hidden moon, mourning her dead.</p>

<p>Young Bull threw back his head and howled with her,
mourned with her.</p>

<p>When he lowered his head, Min was staring at him.
&ldquo;Are you all right, Perrin?&rdquo; she asked hesitantly. There was a
bruise on her cheek, and a sleeve half torn from her coat. She had
a cudgel in one hand and a dagger in the other, and there was blood
and hair on both.</p>

<p>They were all staring at him, he saw, all those who
were still on their feet. Loial, leaning wearily on his tall staff.
Shienarans, who had been carrying their fallen down to where
Moiraine crouched over one of their number with Lan standing at her
side. Even the Aes Sedai was looking his way. The burning trees,
like huge torches, cast a wavering light. Dead Trollocs lay
everywhere. There were more Shienarans down than standing, and the
bodies of his brothers were scattered among them. So many&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perrin realized he wanted to howl again. Frantically
he walled himself off from contact with the wolves. Images seeped
through, emotions, as he tried to stop them. Finally, though, he
could no longer feel them, feel their pain, or their anger, or the
desire to hunt the Twisted Ones, or to run&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He gave himself a
shake. The wound on his back burned like fire, and his torn
shoulder felt as if it had been hammered on an anvil. His bare
feet, scraped and bruised, throbbed with his pain. The smell of
blood was everywhere. The smell of Trollocs, and death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m all right, Min.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You fought well, blacksmith,&rdquo; Lan said. The Warder
raised his still-bloody sword above his head. &ldquo;<em>Tai&rsquo;shar
Manetheren! Tai&rsquo;shar Andor!</em>&rdquo; True Blood of Manetheren. True
Blood of Andor.</p>

<p>The Shienarans still standing&mdash;so few&mdash;lifted their blades and joined him. &ldquo;<em>Tai&rsquo;shar Manetheren!
Tai&rsquo;shar Andor!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial nodded. &ldquo;<em>Ta&rsquo;veren</em>,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>Perrin lowered his eyes in embarrassment. Lan had
saved him from the questions he did not want to answer, but had
given him an honor he did not deserve. The others did not
understand. He wondered what they would say if they knew the truth.
Min moved closer, and he muttered, &ldquo;Leya&rsquo;s dead. I couldn&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I
almost reached her in time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t have made any difference,&rdquo; she said
softly. &ldquo;You know that.&rdquo; She leaned to look at his back, and
winced. &ldquo;Moiraine will take care of that for you. She&rsquo;s Healing
those she can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin nodded. His back felt sticky with drying blood
all the way to his waist, but despite the pain he hardly noticed
it. <em>Light, I almost didn&rsquo;t come back that time. I can&rsquo;t let
that happen again. I won&rsquo;t. Never again!</em></p>

<p>But when he was with the wolves, it was all so
different. He did not have to worry about strangers being afraid of
him just because he was big, then. There was no one thinking he was
slow-witted just because he tried to be careful. Wolves knew each
other even if they had never met before, and with them he was just
another wolf.</p>

<p><em>No!</em> His hands tightened on the haft of his
axe. <em>No!</em> He gave a start as Masema suddenly spoke up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a sign,&rdquo; the Shienaran said, turning in a
circle to address everyone. There was blood on his arms and his
chest&mdash;he had fought in nothing but his breeches&mdash;and
he moved with a limp, but the light in his eyes was as fervent as
it had ever been. More fervent. &ldquo;A sign to confirm our faith. Even
wolves came to fight for the Dragon Reborn. In the Last Battle, the
Lord Dragon will summon even the beasts of the forest to fight at
our sides. It is a sign for us to go forth. Only Darkfriends will
fail to join us.&rdquo; Two of the Shienarans nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shut your bloody mouth, Masema!&rdquo; Uno snapped. He
seemed untouched, but then Uno had been fighting Trollocs since
before Perrin was born. Yet he sagged with weariness; only the
painted eye on his eyepatch seemed fresh. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll flaming go forth
when the Lord Dragon bloody well tells us, and not before! You
sheep-headed farmers flaming remember that!&rdquo; The one-eyed man
looked at the growing row of men being tended by Moiraine&mdash;few were able to as much as sit up, even after she was done with
them&mdash;and shook his head. &ldquo;At least we&rsquo;ll have plenty of
flaming wolf hides to keep the wounded warm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>No!</em>&rdquo; The Shienarans seemed surprised at the
vehemence in Perrin&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;They fought for us, and we&rsquo;ll bury
them with our dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uno frowned, and opened his mouth as if to argue, but
Perrin fixed him with a steady, yellow-eyed stare. It was the
Shienaran who dropped his gaze first, and nodded.</p>

<p>Perrin cleared his throat, embarrassed all over again
as Uno gave orders for the Shienarans who were fit to gather the
dead wolves. Min was squinting at him the way she did when she saw
things. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Rand?&rdquo; he asked her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out there in the dark,&rdquo; she said, nodding upslope
without taking her eyes off him. &ldquo;He will not talk to anyone. He
just sits there, snapping at anyone who comes near him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will talk to me,&rdquo; Perrin said. She followed him,
protesting all the while that he ought to wait until Moiraine had
seen to his injuries. <em>Light, what does she see when she looks
at me? I don&rsquo;t want to know</em>.</p>

<p>Rand was seated on the ground just beyond the light
of the burning trees, with his back against the trunk of a stunted
oak. Staring at nothing, he had his arms wrapped around himself,
hands under his red coat, as if feeling the cold. He did not appear
to notice their approach. Min sat down beside him, but he did not
move even when she laid a hand on his arm. Even here Perrin smelled
blood, and not only his own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand,&rdquo; Perrin began, but Rand cut him off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know what I did during the fight?&rdquo; Still
staring into the distance, Rand addressed the night. &ldquo;Nothing!
Nothing useful. At first, when I reached out for the True Source, I
couldn&rsquo;t touch it, couldn&rsquo;t grasp it. It kept sliding away. Then,
when I finally had hold of it, I was going to burn them all, burn
all the Trollocs and Fades. And all I could do was set fire to some
trees.&rdquo; He shook with silent laughter, then stopped with a pained
grimace. &ldquo;<em>Saidin</em> filled me till I thought I&rsquo;d explode like
fireworks. I had to channel it somewhere, get rid of it before it
burned me up, and I found myself thinking about pulling the
mountain down and burying the Trollocs. I almost tried. That was my
fight. Not against the Trollocs. Against myself. To keep from
burying us all under the mountain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min gave Perrin a pained look, as if asking for
help.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;dealt with them, Rand,&rdquo; Perrin said. He
shivered, thinking of all the wounded men down below. And the dead.
<em>Better that than the mountain down on top of us</em>. &ldquo;We
didn&rsquo;t need you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s head fell back against the tree and his eyes
closed. &ldquo;I felt them coming,&rdquo; he said, nearly whispering. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
know what it was, though. They feel like the taint on <em>
saidin</em>. And <em>saidin</em> is always there, calling to me,
singing to me. By the time I knew the difference, Lan was already
shouting his warning. If I could only control it, I could have
given warning before they were even close. But half the time when I
actually manage to touch <em>saidin</em>, I don&rsquo;t know what I am
doing at all. The flow of it just sweeps me along. I could have
given warning, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin shifted his bruised feet uncomfortably. &ldquo;We
had warning enough.&rdquo; He knew he sounded as if he were trying to
convince himself. <em>I could have given warning, too, if I&rsquo;d
talked with the wolves. They knew there were Trollocs and Fades in
the mountains. They were trying to tell me</em>. But he wondered:
If he did not keep the wolves out of his mind, might he not be
running with them now? There had been a man, Elyas Machera, who
also could talk to wolves. Elyas ran with the wolves all the time,
yet seemed able to remember he was a man. But he had never told
Perrin how he did it, and Perrin had not seen him in a long
time.</p>

<p>The crunch of boots on rock announced two people
coming, and a swirl of air carried their scents to Perrin. He was
careful not to speak names, though, until Lan and Moiraine were
close enough for even ordinary eyes to make them out.</p>

<p>The Warder had a hand under the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s arm, as
if trying to support her without letting her know it. Moiraine&rsquo;s
eyes were haggard, and she carried a small, age-dark ivory carving
of a woman in one hand. Perrin knew it for an <em>angreal</em>, a remnant
from the Age of Legends that allowed an Aes Sedai to safely channel
more of the Power than she could alone. It was a measure of her
tiredness that she was using it for Healing.</p>

<p>Min got to her feet to help Moiraine, but the Aes
Sedai motioned her away. &ldquo;Everyone else is seen to,&rdquo; she told Min.
&ldquo;When I am done here, I can rest.&rdquo; She shook off Lan as well, and a
look of concentration appeared on her face as she traced a cool
hand across Perrin&rsquo;s bleeding shoulder, then along the wound on his
back. Her touch made his skin tingle. &ldquo;This is not too bad,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;The bruising of your shoulder goes deep, but the gashes are
shallow. Brace yourself. This will not hurt, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had never found it easy being near someone he knew
was channeling the One Power, and still less if it actually
involved him. Yet there had been one or two of those times, and he
thought he had some idea what the channeling entailed, but those
Healings had been minor, simply washing away tiredness when
Moiraine could not afford to have him weary. They had been nothing
like this.</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai&rsquo;s eyes suddenly seemed to be seeing
inside him, seeing through him. He gasped and almost dropped his
axe. He could feel the skin on his back crawling, muscles writhing
as they knit back together. His shoulder quivered uncontrollably,
and everything blurred. Cold seared him to the bone, then deeper
still. He had the impression of moving, falling, flying; he could
not tell which, but he felt as if he were rushing somewhere,
somehow at great speed, forever. After an eternity the world came
into focus again. Moiraine was stepping back, half staggering until
Lan caught her arm.</p>

<p>Gaping, Perrin looked down at his shoulder. The
gashes and bruises were gone, not so much as a twinge remained. He
twisted carefully, but the pain in his back had vanished as well.
And his feet no longer hurt; he did not need to look to know all
the bruises and scrapes were gone. His stomach rumbled loudly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should eat as soon as you can,&rdquo; Moiraine told
him. &ldquo;A good bit of the strength for that came from you. You need
to replace it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hunger&mdash;and images of food&mdash;were already
filling Perrin&rsquo;s head. Blood rare beef, and venison, and mutton,
and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;With an effort he made himself stop thinking of meat. He
would find some of those roots that smelled like turnips when they
were roasted. His stomach growled in protest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s barely even a scar, blacksmith,&rdquo; Lan said
behind him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most of the wolves who were hurt made their own way
to the forest,&rdquo; Moiraine said, knuckling her back and stretching,
&ldquo;but I Healed those I could find.&rdquo; Perrin gave her a sharp look,
yet she seemed to be just making conversation. &ldquo;Perhaps they came
for their own reasons, yet we would likely all be dead without
them.&rdquo; Perrin shifted uneasily and dropped his eyes.</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai reached toward the bruise on Min&rsquo;s
cheek, but Min stepped back, saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not really hurt, and
you&rsquo;re tired. I&rsquo;ve had worse falling over my own feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine smiled and let her hand fall. Lan took her
arm; she swayed in his grip. &ldquo;Very well. And what of you, Rand? Did
you take any hurt? Even a nick from a Myrddraal&rsquo;s blade can be
deadly, and some Trolloc blades are almost as bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin noticed something for the first time. &ldquo;Rand,
your coat is wet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand pulled his right hand from under his coat, a
hand covered in blood. &ldquo;Not a Myrddraal,&rdquo; he said absently, peering
at his hand. &ldquo;Not even a Trolloc. The wound I took at Falme broke
open.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine hissed and jerked her arm free from Lan,
half fell to her knees beside Rand. Pulling back the side of his
coat, she studied his wound. Perrin could not see it, for her head
was in the way, but the smell of blood was stronger, now.
Moiraine&rsquo;s hands moved, and Rand grimaced in pain. &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;The blood of
the Dragon Reborn on the rocks of Shayol Ghul will free mankind
from the Shadow.&rsquo; Isn&rsquo;t that what the Prophecies of the Dragon
say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo; Moiraine said sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you could get me to Shayol Ghul now,&rdquo; Rand said
drowsily, &ldquo;by Waygate or Portal Stone, there could be an end to it.
No more dying. No more dreams. No more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it were as simple as that,&rdquo; Moiraine said grimly,
&ldquo;I would, one way or another, but not all in <em>The Karaethon
Cycle</em> can be taken at its face. For everything it says
straight out, there are ten that could mean a hundred different
things. Do not think you know anything at all of what <em>must</em>
be, even if someone has told you the whole of the Prophecies.&rdquo; She
paused, as if gathering strength. Her grip tightened on the
<em>angreal</em>, and her free hand slid along Rand&rsquo;s side as if it were not
covered in blood. &ldquo;Brace yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly Rand&rsquo;s eyes opened wide, and he sat straight
up, gasping and staring and shivering. Perrin had thought, when she
Healed him, that it went on forever, but in moments she was easing
Rand back against the oak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;done as much as I can,&rdquo; she said
faintly. &ldquo;As much as I can. You must be careful. It could break
open again if&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; As her voice trailed off, she fell.</p>

<p>Rand caught her, but Lan was there in an instant to
scoop her up. As the Warder did so, a look passed across his face,
a look as close to tenderness as Perrin ever expected to see from
Lan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exhausted,&rdquo; the Warder said. &ldquo;She has cared for
everyone else, but there&rsquo;s no one to take her fatigue. I will put
her to bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Rand,&rdquo; Min said slowly, but the Warder shook
his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that I do not think you would try,
sheepherder,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but you know so little you might as soon
kill her as help her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Rand said bitterly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not to be
trusted. Lews Therin Kinslayer killed everyone close to him. Maybe
I&rsquo;ll do the same before I am done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pull yourself together, sheepherder,&rdquo; Lan said
harshly. &ldquo;The whole world rides on your shoulders. Remember you&rsquo;re
a man, and do what needs to be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand looked up at the Warder, and surprisingly, all
of his bitterness seemed to be gone. &ldquo;I will fight the best I can,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Because there&rsquo;s no one else, and it has to be done, and
the duty is mine. I&rsquo;ll fight, but I do not have to like what I&rsquo;ve
become.&rdquo; He closed his eyes as if going to sleep. &ldquo;I will fight.
Dreams&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan stared down at him a moment, then nodded. He
raised his head to look across Moiraine at Perrin and Min. &ldquo;Get him
to his bed, then see to some sleep yourselves. We have plans to
make, and the Light alone knows what happens next.&rdquo;</p>
