his saddle, Perrin frowned down at the flat
stone half hidden in weeds by the roadside. This road of
hard-packed dirt, already called the Lugard Road now that they were
approaching the River Manetherendrelle and the border of Lugard,
had been paved once, long in the past, so Moiraine had said two
days earlier, and bits of paving stone still worked their way to
the surface from time to time. This one had an odd marking on
it.</p>

<p>If dogs had been able to make footprints on stone, he
would have said it was the print of a large hound. There were no
hound&rsquo;s footprints in any of the bare ground he could see, where
softer dirt on the verge might take one, and no smell of any dog&rsquo;s
trail. Just a faint trace in the air of something burned, almost
the sulphurous smell left by setting off fireworks. There was a
town ahead, where the road struck the river; maybe some children
had sneaked out here with some of the Illuminators&rsquo; handiwork.</p>

<p><em>A long way yet for children to sneak</em>. But he
had seen farms. <em>It could have been farm children. Whatever it
is, it has nothing to do with that marking. Horses don&rsquo;t fly, and
dogs don&rsquo;t make footprints on stone. I&rsquo;m getting too tired to think
straight</em>.</p>

<p>Yawning, he dug his heels into Stepper&rsquo;s ribs, and
the dun broke into gallop after the others. Moiraine had been
pushing them hard since leaving Jarra, and there was no waiting for
anyone who stopped for even a moment. When the Aes Sedai put her
mind on something, she was as hard as cold hammered iron. Loial had
given up reading as he rode six days earlier, after looking up to
find himself left a mile behind and everyone else almost out of
sight over the next hill.</p>

<p>Perrin slowed Stepper alongside the Ogier&rsquo;s big
horse, behind Moiraine&rsquo;s white mare, and yawned again. Lan was up
ahead somewhere, scouting. The sun behind them stood no more than
an hour above the treetops, but the Warder had said they would
reach a town called Remen, on the Manetherendrelle, before dark.
Perrin was not sure he wanted to see what awaited them there. He
did not know what it might be, but the days since Jarra had made
him wary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you can&rsquo;t sleep,&rdquo; Loial told him. &ldquo;I
am so tired by the time she lets us halt for the night, I fall
asleep before I can lie down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin only shook his head. There was no way to
explain to Loial that he did not dare sleep soundly, that even his
lightest sleep was full of troubled dreams. Like that odd one with
Egwene and Hopper in it. <em>Well, no wonder I dream about her.
Light, I wonder how she is. Safe in the Tower by now, and learning
how to be Aes Sedai. Verin will look after her, and after Mat,
too</em>. He did not think anyone needed to look after Nynaeve;
around Nynaeve, to his mind, other people needed someone to look
after them.</p>

<p>He did not want to think about Hopper. He was
succeeding in keeping live wolves out of his head, although at the
price of feeling as if he had been hammered-and-drawn by a hasty
hand; he did not want to think a dead wolf might be creeping in. He
shook himself and forced his eyes wide open. Not even Hopper.</p>

<p>There had been more reasons than bad dreams not to
sleep well. They had found other signs left by Rand&rsquo;s passage.
Between Jarra and the River Eldar there had been none Perrin could
see, but when they crossed the Eldar by a stone bridge arching from
one fifty-foot river cliff to another, they had left behind a town
called Sidon all in ashes. Every building. Only a few stone walls
and chimneys still stood among the ruins.</p>

<p>Bedraggled townspeople said a lantern dropped in a
barn had started it, and then the fire seemed to run wild, and
everything went wrong. Half the buckets that could be found had
holes in them. Every last burning wall had fallen outward instead
of in, setting houses to either side alight. Flaming timbers from
the inn had somehow tumbled as far as the main well in the square,
so no one could draw more water from it to fight the fires, and
houses had fallen right on top of three other wells. Even the wind
had seemed to shift, fanning the flames in every direction.</p>

<p>There had been no need to ask Moiraine if Rand&rsquo;s
presence had caused it; her face, like cold iron, was answer
enough. The Pattern shaped itself around Rand, and chance ran
wild.</p>

<p>Beyond Sidon they had ridden through four small towns
where only Lan&rsquo;s tracking told them Rand was still ahead. Rand was
afoot, now, and had been for some time. They had found his horse
back beyond Jarra, dead, looking as if it had been mauled by
wolves, or dogs run wild. It had been hard for Perrin not to reach
out, then, especially when Moiraine looked up from the horse to
frown at him. Luckily, Lan had found the tracks of Rand&rsquo;s boots,
running from where the dead horse lay. One boot heel had a
three-cornered gouge from a rock; it made his prints plain. But
afoot or mounted, he seemed to be staying ahead of them.</p>

<p>In the four villages after Sidon, the biggest
excitement anyone could remember was seeing Loial ride in, and
discovering that he was an Ogier, for real and for true. They were
so caught up with that, that they barely even noticed Perrin&rsquo;s
eyes, and when they did&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Well, if Ogier were real, then men
could very well have any color eyes at all.</p>

<p>But after those came a little place named Willar, and
it was celebrating. The spring on the village common was flowing
again, after a year of hauling water a mile from a stream when all
efforts at digging wells had failed and half the people had moved
away. Willar would not die after all. Three more untouched villages
had been followed in quick succession, all in one day, by Samaha,
where every well in town had gone dry just the night before, and
people were muttering about the Dark One; then Tallan, where all
the old arguments the village had ever known had bubbled to the
surface like overflowing cesspits a morning earlier, and it had
taken three murders to shock everyone back to their senses; and
finally Fyall, where the crops this spring looked to be the poorest
anyone could remember, but the Mayor, digging a new privy behind
his house, had found rotted leather sacks full of gold, so none
would go hungry. No one in Fyall recognized the fat coins, with a
woman&rsquo;s face on one side and an eagle on the other; Moiraine said
they had been minted in Manetheren.</p>

<p>Perrin had finally asked her about it, as they sat
around their campfire one night. &ldquo;After Jarra, I thought&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;They
were all so happy, with their weddings. Even the Whitecloaks were
only made to look like fools. Fyall was all right&mdash;Rand
couldn&rsquo;t have had anything to do with their crops; they were
failing before he ever came, and that gold was surely good, with
their need&mdash;but all this other&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;That town burning, and
the wells failing, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;That is evil, Moiraine. I can&rsquo;t
believe Rand is evil. The Pattern may be shaping itself around him,
but how can the Pattern be that evil? It makes no sense, and things
have to make sense. If you make a tool with no sense to it, it&rsquo;s
wasted metal. The Pattern wouldn&rsquo;t make waste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan gave him a wry look, and vanished into the
darkness to make a circuit around their campsite. Loial, already
stretched out in his blankets, lifted his head to listen, ears
pricking forward.</p>

<p>Moiraine was silent for a time, warming her hands.
Finally she spoke while staring into the flames. &ldquo;The Creator is
good, Perrin. The Father of Lies is evil. The Pattern of Age, the
Age Lace itself, is neither. The Pattern is what is. The Wheel of
Time weaves all lives into the Pattern, all actions. A pattern that
is all one color is no pattern. For the Pattern of an Age, good and
ill are the warp and the woof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even riding through late-afternoon sunshine three
days later, Perrin felt the chill he had had on first hearing her
say those words. He wanted to believe the Pattern was good. He
wanted to believe that when men did evil things, they were going
against the Pattern, distorting it. To him the Pattern was a fine
and intricate creation made by a master smith. That it mixed pot
metal and worse in with good steel with never a care was a cold
thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I care,&rdquo; he muttered softly. &ldquo;Light, I do care.&rdquo;
Moiraine glanced back at him, and he fell silent. He was not sure
what the Aes Sedai cared about, beyond Rand.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Lan appeared from ahead and swung
his black warhorse in beside Moiraine&rsquo;s mare. &ldquo;Remen lies just over
the next hill,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They have had an eventful day or two, it
seems.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial&rsquo;s ears twitched once. &ldquo;Rand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Warder shook his head. &ldquo;I do not know. Perhaps
Moiraine can say, when she sees.&rdquo; The Aes Sedai gave him a
searching look, then heeled her white mare to a quicker step.</p>

<p>They topped the hill, and Remen lay spread out below
them, hard against the river. The Manetherendrelle stretched more
than half a mile wide here, and there was no bridge, though two
crowded, barge-like ferries crept across, propelled by long oars, and one nearly empty was
returning. Three more shared long stone docks with nearly a dozen
river traders&rsquo; vessels, some with
one mast, some with two. A few bulky gray stone warehouses
separated the docks from the town itself, where the buildings
seemed mostly of stone, as well, though roofed in tiles of every
color from yellow to red to purple, and the streets ran every which
way around a central square.</p>

<p>Moiraine pulled up the deep hood of her cloak to hide
her face before they rode down.</p>

<p>As usual, the people in the streets stared at Loial,
but this time Perrin heard awed murmurs of &ldquo;Ogier.&rdquo; Loial sat
straighter in his saddle than he had in some time, and his ears
stood straight, and a smile just curled the ends of his wide mouth.
He was obviously trying not to let on that he was pleased, but he
looked like a cat having its ears scratched.</p>

<p>Remen looked like any of a dozen towns to Perrin&mdash;it was full of manmade aromas and man smell; with a strong
smell of the river, of course&mdash;and he was wondering what Lan
could have meant when the hair on the back of his neck stirred as
he scented something wrong. As soon as his nose took it in, it was
gone like a horsehair dropped onto hot coals, but he remembered it.
He had smelled the same smell at Jarra, and it had vanished the
same way, then. It was not a Twisted One or a Neverborn&mdash;<em>
Trolloc, burn me, not a Twisted One! Not a Neverborn! A Myrddraal,
a Fade, a Halfman, anything but a Neverborn!</em>&mdash;not a
Trolloc or a Fade, yet the stench had been every bit as sharp,
every bit as vile. But whatever gave off that scent left no lasting
trail, it seemed.</p>

<p>They rode into the town square. One of the big paving
blocks had been pried up, right in the middle of the square, so a
gibbet could be erected. A single thick timber rose out of the
dirt, supporting a braced crosspiece from which hung an iron cage,
the bottom of it four paces high. A tall man dressed all in grays
and browns sat in the cage, holding his knees under his chin. He
had no room to do otherwise. Three small boys were pitching stones
at him. The man looked straight ahead, not flinching when a stone
made it between the bars. More than one trickle of blood stained
his face. The townspeople walking by paid no more mind to what the
boys were doing than the man did, though every last one of them
looked at the cage, most of them with approval, and some with
fear.</p>

<p>Moiraine made a sound in her throat that might have
been disgust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is more,&rdquo; Lan said. &ldquo;Come. I&rsquo;ve already
arranged rooms at an inn. I think you will find it
interesting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin looked back over his shoulder at the caged man
as he rode after them. There was something familiar about the man,
but he could not place it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They shouldn&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo; Loial&rsquo;s rumble sounded
halfway to a snarl. &ldquo;The children, I mean. The grown-ups should
stop them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They should,&rdquo; Perrin agreed, barely paying
attention. <em>Why is he familiar?</em></p>

<p>The sign over the door of the inn Lan led them to,
nearer the river, read Wayland&rsquo;s Forge, which Perrin took for a
good omen, though there seemed to be nothing of the smithy about
the place except the leather-aproned man with a hammer painted on
the sign. It was a large, purple-roofed, three-story building of
squared and polished gray stones, with large windows and
scroll-carved doors, and it had a prosperous look. Stablemen came
running to take the horses, bowing even more deeply after Lan
tossed them coins.</p>

<p>Inside, Perrin stared at the people. The men and
women at the tables were all dressed in their feastday clothes, it
seemed to him, with more embroidered coats, more lace on dresses,
more colored ribbons and fringed scarves, than he had seen in a
long time. Only four men sitting at one table wore plain coats, and
they were the only ones who did not look up expectantly when Perrin
and the others walked in. The four men kept on talking softly. He
could make out a little of what they were saying, about the virtues
of ice peppers over furs as cargo and what the troubles in Saldaea
might have done to prices. Captains of trading ships, he decided.
The others seemed to be local folk. Even the serving women appeared
to be wearing their best, their long aprons covering embroidered
dresses with bits of lace at the neck.</p>

<p>The kitchen was working heavily; he could smell
mutton, lamb, chicken, and beef, as well as some sort of
vegetables. And a spicy cake that made him forget meat for a
moment.</p>

<p>The innkeeper himself met them just inside, a plump,
bald-headed man with shining brown eyes in a smooth pink face,
bowing and dry-washing his hands. If he had not come to them,
Perrin would never have taken him for the landlord, for instead of
the expected white apron, he wore a coat like everyone else, all
white-and-green embroidery on stout blue wool that had the man
sweating with its weight.</p>

<p><em>Why are they all wearing clothes for
festival?</em> Perrin wondered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Master Andra,&rdquo; the innkeeper said, addressing
Lan. &ldquo;And an Ogier, just as you said. Not that I doubted, of
course. Not with all that&rsquo;s happened, and never your word, master.
Why not an Ogier? Ah, friend Ogier, to be having you in the house
gives me more pleasure than you can be knowing. &rsquo;Tis a fine thing,
and a fitting cap to it all. Ah, and mistress&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; His eyes took
in the deep blue silk of her dress and the rich wool of her cloak,
dusty from travel but still fine. &ldquo;Forgive me, Lady, please.&rdquo; His
bow bent him like a horseshoe. &ldquo;Master Andra did not make your
station clear, Lady. I meant no disrespect. You are even more
welcome than friend Ogier here, of course, Lady. Please, take no
offense at Gainor Furlan&rsquo;s poor tongue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I take none.&rdquo; Moiraine&rsquo;s voice calmly accepted the
title Furlan gave her. It was far from the first time the Aes Sedai
had gone under another name, or pretended to be something she was
not. It was not the first Perrin had heard Lan name himself Andra,
either. The deep hood still hid Moiraine&rsquo;s smooth Aes Sedai
features, and she held her cloak around her with one hand as if
taken with a chill. Not the hand on which she wore her Great
Serpent ring. &ldquo;You have had strange occurrences in the town,
innkeeper, so I understand. Nothing to trouble travelers, I
trust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Lady, you might be calling them strange indeed.
Your own radiant presence is more than enough to honor this humble
house, Lady, and bringing an Ogier with you, but we have Hunters in
Remen, too. Right here in Wayland&rsquo;s Forge, they are. Hunters for
the Horn of Valere, set out from Illian for adventure. And
adventure they found, Lady, here in Remen, or just a mile or two
upriver, fighting wild Aielmen, of all things. Can you imagine
black-veiled Aiel savages in Altara, Lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aiel. Now Perrin knew what was familiar about the man
in the cage. He had seen an Aiel, once, one of those fierce, nearly
legendary denizens of the harsh land called the Waste. The man had
looked a good deal like Rand, taller than most, with gray eyes and
reddish hair, and he had been dressed like the man in the cage, all
in browns and grays that would fade into rock or brush, with soft
boots laced to his knees. Perrin could almost hear Min&rsquo;s voice
again. <em>An Aielman in a cage. A turning point in your life, or
something important that will happen</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you have&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; He stopped to clear his
throat so he would not sound so hoarse. &ldquo;How did an Aiel come to be
caged in your town square?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, young master, that is a story to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Furlan
trailed off, eyeing him up and down, taking in his plain country
clothes and the longbow in his hands, pausing over the axe at his
belt opposite his quiver. The plump man gave a start when his study
reached Perrin&rsquo;s face, as if, with a Lady and an Ogier present, he
had just now noticed Perrin&rsquo;s yellow eyes. &ldquo;He would be your
servant, Master Andra?&rdquo; he asked cautiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Answer him,&rdquo; was all Lan said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah. Ah, of course, Master Andra. But here&rsquo;s who can
tell it better than myself. &rsquo;Tis Lord Orban, himself. &rsquo;Tis he we
have gathered to hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A dark-haired, youngish man in a red coat, with a
bandage wound around his temples, was making his way down the
stairs at the side of the common room using padded crutches, the
left leg of his breeches cut away so more bandages could strap his
calf from ankle to knee. The townspeople murmured as if seeing
something wondrous. The ship captains went on with their quiet
talking; they had come &rsquo;round to furs.</p>

<p>Furlan might have thought the man in the red coat
could tell the story better, but he went ahead himself. &ldquo;Lord Orban
and Lord Gann faced twenty wild Aielmen with only ten retainers.
Ah, fierce was the fighting and hard, with many wounds given and
received. Six good retainers died, and every man took hurts, Lord
Orban and Lord Gann worst of all, but every Aiel they slew, save
those who fled, and one they took prisoner. &rsquo;Tis that one you see
out there in the square, where he&rsquo;ll not be troubling the
countryside anymore with his savage ways, no more than the dead
ones will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have had trouble from Aiel in this district?&rdquo;
Moiraine asked.</p>

<p>Perrin was wondering the same thing, with no little
consternation. If some people still occasionally used &ldquo;black-veiled
Aiel&rdquo; as a term for someone violent, it was testimony to the
impression the Aiel War had left, but that was twenty years in the
past, now, and the Aiel had never come out of the Waste before or
since. <em>But I saw one this side of the Spine of the World, and
now I&rsquo;ve seen two</em>.</p>

<p>The innkeeper rubbed at his bald head. &ldquo;Ah. Ah, no,
Lady, not exactly. But we would have had, you can be sure, with
twenty savages loose. Why, everyone remembers how they killed and
looted and burned their way across Cairhien. Men from this very
village marched to the Battle of the Shining Walls, when the
nations gathered to throw them back. I myself suffered from a
twisted back at the time and so could not go, but I remember well,
as we all do. How they came here, so far from their own land, or
why, I do not know, but Lord Orban and Lord Gann saved us from
them.&rdquo; There was a murmur of agreement from the folk in feastday
clothes.</p>

<p>Orban himself came stumping across the common room,
not seeming to see anyone but the innkeeper. Perrin could smell
stale wine before he was even close. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that old woman taken
herself off to with her herbs, Furlan?&rdquo; Orban demanded roughly.
&ldquo;Gann&rsquo;s wounds are paining him, and my head feels about to split
open.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Furlan almost bent his head to the floor. &ldquo;Ah, Mother
Leich will be back in the morning, Lord Orban. A birthing, Lord.
But she said she&rsquo;d stitched and poulticed your wounds, and Lord
Gann&rsquo;s, so there&rsquo;d be no worrying. Ah, Lord Orban, I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll
be seeing to you first thing on the morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bandaged man muttered something under his breath&mdash;under his breath to any ears but Perrin&rsquo;s&mdash;about
waiting on a farmwife &ldquo;throwing her litter&rdquo; and something else
about being &ldquo;sewn up like a sack of meal.&rdquo; He shifted sullen, angry
eyes, and for the first time appeared to see the newcomers. Perrin,
he dismissed immediately, which did not surprise Perrin at all. His
eyes widened a little at Loial&mdash;<em>He&rsquo;s seen Ogier</em>,
Perrin thought, <em>but he never thought to see one here</em>&mdash;narrowed a bit at Lan&mdash;<em>He knows a fighting man
when he sees one, and he does not like seeing one</em>&mdash;and
brightened as he stooped to peer inside Moiraine&rsquo;s hood, though he
was not close enough to see her face.</p>

<p>Perrin decided not to think anything at all about
that, not concerning an Aes Sedai, and he hoped neither Moiraine
nor Lan thought anything of it, either. A light in the Warder&rsquo;s
eyes told him he had missed on that hope, at least.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twelve of you fought twenty Aiel?&rdquo; Lan asked in a
flat voice.</p>

<p>Orban straightened, wincing. In an elaborately casual
tone, he said, &ldquo;Aye, you must expect things such as that when you
seek the Horn of Valere. It was not the first such encounter for
Gann and me, nor will it be the last before we find the Horn. If
the Light shines on us.&rdquo; He sounded as if the Light could not
possibly do anything else. &ldquo;Not all our fights have been with Aiel,
of course, but there are always those who would stop Hunters, if
they could. Gann and I, we do not stop easily.&rdquo; Another approving
murmur came from the townspeople. Orban stood a little
straighter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You lost six, and took one prisoner.&rdquo; From Lan&rsquo;s
voice, it was not clear if that was a good exchange or a poor
one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; Orban said, &ldquo;we slew the rest, save those who
ran. No doubt they&rsquo;re hiding their dead now; I&rsquo;ve heard they do
that. The Whitecloaks are out searching for them, but they&rsquo;ll never
find them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are Whitecloaks here?&rdquo; Perrin asked
sharply.</p>

<p>Orban glanced at him, and dismissed him once more.
The man addressed Lan again. &ldquo;Whitecloaks always put their noses in
where they are not wanted or needed. Incompetent louts, all of
them. Aye, they&rsquo;ll ride all over the countryside for days, but I
doubt they&rsquo;ll find as much as their own shadows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose they won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Lan said.</p>

<p>The bandaged man frowned as if unsure exactly what
Lan meant, then rounded on the innkeeper again. &ldquo;You find that old
woman, hear! My head is splitting.&rdquo; With a last glance at Lan, he
hobbled away, climbing back up the stairs one at a time, followed
by murmurs of admiration for a Hunter of the Horn who had slain
Aielmen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is an eventful town.&rdquo; Loial&rsquo;s deep voice drew
every eye to him. Except for the ship captains, who seemed to be
discussing rope, as near as Perrin could make out. &ldquo;Everywhere I
go, you humans are doing things, hurrying and scurrying, having
things happen to you. How can you stand so much excitement?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, friend Ogier,&rdquo; Furlan said, &ldquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;tis the way of us
humans to want excitement. How much I regret not being able to
march to the Shining Walls. Why, let me tell you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our rooms.&rdquo; Moiraine did not raise her voice, but
her words cut the innkeeper short like a sharp knife. &ldquo;Andra did
arrange rooms, did he not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Lady, forgive me. Yes, Master Andra did indeed
hire rooms. Forgive me, please. &rsquo;Tis all the excitement, makes my
head empty itself. Please forgive me, Lady. This way, if you
please. If you&rsquo;ll please to follow me.&rdquo; Bowing and scraping,
apologizing and babbling without pause, Furlan led them up the
stairs.</p>

<p>At the top, Perrin paused to look back. He heard the
murmurs of &ldquo;Lady&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ogier&rdquo; down there, could feel all those
eyes, but it seemed to him that he felt one pair of eyes in
particular, someone staring not at Moiraine and Loial, but at
him.</p>

<p>He picked her out immediately. For one thing, she
stood apart from the others, and for another she was the only woman
in the room not wearing at least a little lace. Her dark gray,
almost black, dress was as plain as the ship captains&rsquo; clothes,
with wide sleeves and narrow skirts, and never a frill or stitch of
fancy-work. The dress was divided for riding, he saw when she
moved, and she wore soft boots that peeked out under the hem. She
was young&mdash;no older than he was, perhaps&mdash;and tall for
a woman, with black hair to her shoulders. A nose that just missed
being too large and too bold, a generous mouth, high cheekbones,
and dark, slightly tilted eyes. He could not quite decide whether
she was beautiful or not.</p>

<p>As soon as he looked down, she turned to address one
of the serving women and did not glance at the stairs again, but he
was sure he had been right. She had been staring at him.</p>
