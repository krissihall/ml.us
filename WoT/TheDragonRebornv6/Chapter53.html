<h4><em>A Flow of the Spirit</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">P</span>errin
shrugged into his coat as he walked back
toward the Star through the evening shadows. A good tiredness
soaked through his arms and shoulders; along with more common work,
Master Ajala had had him make a large piece of ornamental work, all
elaborate curves and scrolls, to go on some country lord&rsquo;s new
gate. He had enjoyed making something so pretty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought his eyes would come out of his face,
blacksmith, when you said you would not make that thing if it was
for a High Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He glanced sideways at Zarine, walking beside him,
the shadows masking her face. Even for his eyes, the shadows were
there, just fainter than they would have been for another&rsquo;s. They
emphasized her high cheekbones, softened the strong curve of her
nose. He just could not make up his mind about her. Even if
Moiraine and Lan still insisted they stay close to the inn, he
wished she could find something else to do besides watch him work.
For some reason, he had found himself growing awkward whenever he
thought of her tilted eyes on him. More than once he had fumbled
with his hammer till Master Ajala frowned at him wonderingly. Girls
had always been able to make him feel awkward, especially when they
smiled at him, but Zarine did not have to smile. Only look. He
wondered again if she was the beautiful woman Min had warned him
against. <em>Better if she is the falcon</em>. That thought
surprised him so much that he stumbled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not want anything I make to get into the hands
of one of the Forsaken.&rdquo; His eyes glowed golden as he looked at
her. &ldquo;If it was for a High Lord, how could I tell where it might
end?&rdquo; She shivered. &ldquo;I did not mean to frighten you, Fai&mdash;Zarine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She smiled broadly, no doubt thinking he could not
see her. &ldquo;You will fall yet, farmboy. Have you ever thought of
wearing a beard?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>It is bad enough she&rsquo;s always mocking me, but
half the time I do not even understand her!</em></p>

<p>As they reached the front door of the inn, Moiraine
and Lan met them, coming the other way. Moiraine wore that linen
cloak with the wide, deep hood that hid her face. Light from the
common-room windows made yellow pools on the paving stones. Two or
three carriages rumbled past, and there were perhaps a dozen people
in sight, hurrying home for their suppers, but for the most part,
shadows populated the street. The weaver&rsquo;s shop was closed tight.
The silence was deafening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand is in Tear.&rdquo; The Aes Sedai&rsquo;s cool voice issued
from the depths of her hood as from a cavern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; Perrin asked. &ldquo;I have not heard of
anything strange happening. No weddings, or wells drying up.&rdquo; He
saw Zarine frown in confusion. Moiraine had not been forthcoming
with her, and neither had he. Keeping Loial&rsquo;s tongue silent had
been more difficult.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you listen to rumors, blacksmith?&rdquo; the Warder
said. &ldquo;There have been marriages, as many in the last four days as
in half a year before. And as many murders as in a whole year. A
child fell from a tower balcony today. A hundred paces onto stone
paving. She got up and ran to her mother without a bruise. The
First of Mayene, a &lsquo;guest&rsquo; in the Stone since before the winter,
announced today that she will submit to the will of the High Lords,
after saying yesterday she would see Mayene and all its ships burn
before one Tairen country lord set foot in the city. They had not
brought themselves to torture her, and that young woman has a will
like iron, so you tell me if you think it might be Rand&rsquo;s doing.
Blacksmith, from top to bottom, Tear bubbles like a cauldron.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These things were not needed to tell me,&rdquo; Moiraine
said. &ldquo;Perrin, did you dream of Rand last night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;He was in the Heart of the
Stone, holding that sword&rdquo;&mdash;he felt Zarine shift beside him&mdash;&ldquo;but I have been worrying about that so much it is no wonder
I dream of it. I had nothing but nightmares last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A tall man?&rdquo; Zarine said. &ldquo;With reddish hair and
gray eyes? Holding something that shines so brightly it hurts your
eyes? In a place that is all great redstone columns? Blacksmith,
tell me that was not your dream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;I have heard this dream
spoken of a hundred times today. They all speak of nightmares&mdash;Be&rsquo;lal apparently does not care to shield his dreams&mdash;but that one above all else.&rdquo; She laughed suddenly, like low, cool
chimes. &ldquo;People say he is the Dragon Reborn. They say he is coming.
They whisper it fearfully in corners, but they say it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what of Be&rsquo;lal?&rdquo; Perrin asked.</p>

<p>Moiraine&rsquo;s reply was cold-drawn steel. &ldquo;I will deal
with him tonight.&rdquo; There was no fear scent from her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>We</em> will deal with him tonight,&rdquo; Lan told
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my Gaidin. We will deal with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what do we do? Sit here and wait? I had enough
waiting to last me a lifetime in the mountains, Moiraine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You and Loial&mdash;and Zarine&mdash;will go to
Tar Valon,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;Until this is done. It will be the
safest place for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is the Ogier?&rdquo; Lan said. &ldquo;I want all three of
you on your way north as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upstairs, I suppose,&rdquo; Perrin said. &ldquo;In his room, or
maybe the dining room. There are lights in the windows up there. He
is always working on those notes of his. I suppose he will have
plenty to say in his book about us running away.&rdquo; He was surprised
at the bitterness in his voice. <em>Light, fool, do you want to
face one of the Forsaken? No. No, but I am tired of running. I
remember not running, once. I remember fighting back, and it was
better. Even if I thought I was going to die, it was
better</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will find him,&rdquo; Zarine announced. &ldquo;I have no shame
in admitting I will be glad enough to run from this fight. Men
fight when they should run, and fools fight when they should run.
But I had no need to say it twice.&rdquo; She strode ahead of them, her
narrow, divided skirts making small whisking noises as they entered
the inn.</p>

<p>Perrin glanced around the common room as they
followed her toward the stairs in the back. There were fewer men at
the tables than he expected. Some sat alone, with dull eyes, but
where two or three sat together they talked in frightened whispers
his ears could barely catch. Even so, he heard &ldquo;Dragon&rdquo; three
times.</p>

<p>As he reached the top of the stairs, he heard another
soft sound, a thump as of something falling in the private dining
room. He peered that way along the hall. &ldquo;Zarine?&rdquo; There was no
answer. He felt the hair on the back of his neck shift, and padded
that way. &ldquo;Zarine?&rdquo; He pushed open the door. &ldquo;Faile!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was lying on the floor near the table. As he
started to rush into the room, Moiraine&rsquo;s commanding shout halted
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop, you fool! Stop, for your life!&rdquo; She came along
the hallway slowly, head turning as if she were listening for
something, or searching for something. Lan followed with his hand
on his sword&mdash;and a look in his eye as if he already knew
steel would do no good. She came abreast of the door and stopped.
&ldquo;Move back, Perrin. Move back!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In agony he stared at Zarine. At Faile. She lay there
as if lifeless. Finally he made himself step back from the door,
leaving it open, standing where he could see her. She looked as if
she were dead. He could not see her chest stir. He wanted to howl.
Frowning, he worked his hand, the one he had used to push the door
into the room, opening and closing his fingers. It tingled sharply,
as if he had struck his elbow. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to do anything,
Moiraine? If you will not, I am going to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand still or you will go nowhere,&rdquo; she said
calmly. &ldquo;What is that by her right hand? As if it dropped from her
grip when she fell. I cannot make it out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He glared at her, then peered into the room. &ldquo;A
hedgehog. It looks like a hedgehog carved out of wood. Moiraine,
tell me what is going on! What has happened? Tell me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A hedgehog,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;A hedgehog. Be silent,
Perrin. I must think. I felt it trigger. I can sense the residues
of the flows woven to set it. Spirit. Pure Spirit, and nothing
else. Almost nothing uses pure flows of Spirit! Why does that
hedgehog make me think of Spirit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You felt what trigger, Moiraine? What was set? A
trap?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, a trap,&rdquo; she said, irritation making tiny
cracks in her cool serenity. &ldquo;A trap meant for me. I would have
been first into that room if Zarine had not rushed ahead. Lan and I
would surely have gone there to plan and wait for supper. I will
not wait on supper now. Be quiet, if you wish me to help the girl
at all. Lan! Bring me that innkeeper!&rdquo; The Warder flowed away down
the stairs.</p>

<p>Moiraine paced up and down in the hall, sometimes
stopping to peer through the door from the depths of her hood.
Perrin could see no sign that Zarine lived. Her breast did not
stir. He tried listening for her heartbeat, but even for his ears
it was impossible.</p>

<p>When Lan returned, shoving a frightened Jurah Haret
ahead of him by the scruff of his fat neck, the Aes Sedai rounded
on the balding man. &ldquo;You promised to keep this room for me, Master
Haret.&rdquo; Her voice was as hard, as precise, as a skinning knife. &ldquo;To
allow not even a serving woman to enter to clean unless I was
present. Who did you let enter it, Master Haret? Tell me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Haret shook like a bowl of pudding. &ldquo;O-only the t-two
Ladies, mistress. T-they w-wished to leave a surprise for you. I
swear, mistress. T-they showed it t-to me. A little h-hedgehog.
T-they said you w-would be surprised.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was surprised, innkeeper,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;Leave
me! And if you whisper a word of this, even in your sleep, I will
pull this inn down and leave only a hole in the ground.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y-yes, mistress,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;I swear it! I do
swear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The innkeeper fell to his knees in his haste to reach
the stairs, and went scrambling down with thumps that suggested he
fell more than once as he ran.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He knows I am here,&rdquo; Moiraine told the Warder, &ldquo;and
he has found someone of the Black Ajah to set his trap, yet perhaps
he thinks I am caught in it. It was a tiny flash of the Power, but
perhaps he is strong enough to have sensed it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he will not suspect we are coming,&rdquo; Lan said
quietly. He almost smiled.</p>

<p>Perrin stared at them, his teeth bared. &ldquo;What about
her?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;What was done to her, Moiraine? Is she alive? I
cannot see her breathe!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is alive,&rdquo; Moiraine said slowly. &ldquo;I cannot, I
dare not, go close enough to her to tell much beyond that, but she
is alive. She&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;sleeps, in a way. As a bear sleeps in the
winter. Her heart beats so slowly you could count minutes between.
Her breathing is the same. She sleeps.&rdquo; Even from within that hood,
he could feel her eyes on him. &ldquo;I fear she is not there, Perrin.
Not in her body any longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean she is not in her body? Light! You
don&rsquo;t mean they&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;took her soul. Like the Gray Men!&rdquo; Moiraine
shook her head, and he drew a relieved breath. His chest hurt as if
he had not breathed since she last spoke. &ldquo;Then where is she,
Moiraine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have a suspicion, but I
do not know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A suspicion, a hint, anything! Burn me, where?&rdquo; Lan
shifted at the roughness in his voice, but he knew he would try to
break the Warder like iron over a hardy if the man tried to stop
him. &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know very little, Perrin.&rdquo; Moiraine&rsquo;s voice was
like cold, unfeeling music. &ldquo;I have remembered the little I know of
what connects a carved hedgehog with Spirit. The carving is a <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em> last studied by Corianin Nedeal, the last Dreamer
the Tower had. The Talent called Dreaming is a thing of Spirit,
Perrin. It is not a thing I have ever studied; my Talents lie in
other ways. I believe that Zarine has been trapped inside a dream,
perhaps even the World of Dreams, <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. All that
is her is inside that dream. All. A Dreamer sends only a part of
herself. If Zarine does not return soon, her body will die. Perhaps
she will live on in the dream. I do not know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is too much you don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Perrin muttered.
He peered into the room and wanted to cry. Zarine looked so small,
lying there, so helpless. <em>Faile. I swear I will only call you
Faile, ever again</em>. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you do something!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The trap has been sprung, Perrin, but it is a trap
that will still catch anyone who steps into that room. I would not
reach her side before it took me. And I have work I must do
tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn you, Aes Sedai! Burn your work! This World of
Dreams? Is it like the wolf dreams? You said these Dreamers
sometimes saw wolves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have told you what I can,&rdquo; she said sharply. &ldquo;It
is time for you to go. Lan and I must be on our way to the Stone.
There can be no waiting, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He said it quietly, but when Moiraine opened
her mouth, he raised his voice. &ldquo;No! I will not leave her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai took a deep breath. &ldquo;Very well,
Perrin.&rdquo; Her voice was ice; calm, smooth, cold. &ldquo;Remain if you
wish. Perhaps you will survive this night. Lan!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She and the Warder strode down the hall to their
rooms. In moments they returned, Lan wearing his color-changing
cloak, and vanished down the stairs without another word to
him.</p>

<p>He stared through the open door at Faile. <em>I have
to do something. If it</em> is <em>like the wolf dreams</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perrin,&rdquo; came Loial&rsquo;s deep rumble, &ldquo;what is this
about Faile?&rdquo; The Ogier came striding down the hall in his
shirtsleeves, ink on his fingers and a pen in his hand. &ldquo;Lan told
me I had to go, and then he said something about Faile, in a trap.
What did he mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Distractedly, Perrin told him what Moiraine had said.
<em>It might work. It might. It has to!</em> He was surprised when
Loial growled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! Perrin, it is not right! Faile was so free. It
is not right to trap her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin peered up at Loial&rsquo;s face, and suddenly
remembered the old stories that claimed Ogier were implacable
enemies. Loial&rsquo;s ears had laid back along the sides of his head,
and his broad face was as hard as an anvil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Loial, I am going to try to help Faile. But I will
be helpless myself while I do. Will you guard my back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial raised those huge hands that held books so
carefully, and his thick fingers curled as if to crush stone. &ldquo;None
will pass me while I live, Perrin. Not Myrddraal or the Dark One
himself.&rdquo; He said it like a simple statement of fact.</p>

<p>Perrin nodded, and looked through the door again.
<em>It has to work. I don&rsquo;t care if Min warned me against her or
not!</em> With a snarl he leaped toward Faile, stretching out his
hand. He thought he touched her ankle before he was gone.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Whether this dream of the trap was <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> or not, Perrin did not know, but he knew it for
the wolf dream. Rolling, grassy hills surrounded him, and scattered
thickets. He saw deer browsing at the edges of the trees, and a
herd of some sort of running animal bounding across the grass, like
brown-striped deer, but with long, straight horns. The smells on
the wind told him they were good to eat, and other scents spoke of
more good hunting all around him. This was the wolf dream.</p>

<p>He was wearing the blacksmith&rsquo;s long leather vest, he
realized, with his arms bare. And there was a weight at his side.
He touched the axe belt, but it was not the axe hanging from its
loop. He ran his fingers over the head of the heavy smith&rsquo;s hammer.
It felt right.</p>

<p>Hopper alighted in front of him.</p>

<p><em>Again you come, like a fool</em>. The sending was
of a cub sticking its nose into a hollow tree trunk to lap honey
despite the bees stinging its muzzle and eyes. <em>The danger is
greater than ever, Young Bull. Evil things walk the dream. The
brothers and sisters avoid the mountains of stone the two-legs pile
up, and almost fear to dream to one another. You must go!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Perrin said. &ldquo;Faile is here, somewhere,
trapped. I have to find her, Hopper. I have to!&rdquo; He felt a shifting
inside him, something changing. He looked down at his curly-haired
legs, his wide paws. He was an even larger wolf than Hopper.</p>

<p><em>You are here too strongly!</em> Every sending
carried shock. <em>You will die, Young Bull!</em></p>

<p><em>If I do not free the falcon, I do not care,
brother</em>.</p>

<p><em>Then we hunt, brother</em>.</p>

<p>Noses to the wind, the two wolves ran across the
plain, seeking the falcon.</p>
