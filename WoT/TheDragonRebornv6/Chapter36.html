<h4><em>Daughter of the Night</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">R</span>ealizing
that he had no way of knowing which cabin
was supposed to be his, he put his head into several. They were
dark, and all of them had two men asleep in the narrow beds built
against each side, all but one, which held Loial, sitting on the
floor between the beds&mdash;and barely fitting&mdash;scribbling
in his cloth-bound book of notes by the light of a gimballed
lantern. The Ogier wanted to talk about the events of the day, but
Perrin, jaws creaking with the effort of holding his yawns in,
thought the ship must have run far enough downriver by now to make
it safe to sleep. Safe to dream. Even if they tried, wolves could
not long keep pace with the sweeps and the current.</p>

<p>Finally he found a windowless cabin with no one in it
at all, which suited him just as well. He wanted to be alone. <em>A
coincidence in the name, that&rsquo;s all</em>, he thought as he lit the
lantern mounted on the wall. <em>Anyway, her real name is
Zarine</em>. But the girl with the high cheekbones and dark, tilted
eyes was not uppermost in his thoughts. He put his bow and other
belongings on one cramped bed, tossed his cloak over them, and sat
on the other to tug off his boots.</p>

<p>Elyas Machera had found a way to live with what he
was, a man somehow linked with wolves, and he had not gone mad.
Thinking back, Perrin was sure Elyas had been living that way for
years before he ever met the man. <em>He wants to be that way. He
accepts it, anyway</em>. That was no solution. Perrin did not want
to live that way, did not want to accept. <em>But if you have the
bar stock to make a knife, you accept it and make a knife, even if
you&rsquo;d like a woodaxe. No! My life is more than iron to be hammered
into shape</em>.</p>

<p>Cautiously, he reached out with his mind, feeling for
wolves, and found&mdash;nothing. Oh, there was a dim impression of
wolves somewhere in the distance, but it faded even as he touched
it. For the first time in so long, he was alone. Blessedly
alone.</p>

<p>Blowing out the lantern, he lay down, for the first
time in days. <em>How in the Light will Loial manage in one of
these?</em> Those all but sleepless nights rolled over him,
exhaustion slacking his muscles. It came to him that he had managed
to put the Aiel out of his head. And the Whitecloaks. <em>
Light-forsaken axe! Burn me, I wish I had never seen it</em>, was
his last thought before sleep.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Thick gray fog surrounded him, dense enough low down
that he could not see his own boots, and so heavy on every side
that he could not make out anything ten paces away. There was
surely nothing nearer. Anything at all might lie within it. The
mist did not feel right; there was no dampness to it. He put a hand
to his belt, seeking the comfort of knowing he could defend
himself, and gave a start. His axe was not there.</p>

<p>Something moved in the fog, a swirling in the
grayness. Something coming his way.</p>

<p>He tensed, wondering if it was better to run or stand
and fight with his bare hands, wondering if there was anything to
fight.</p>

<p>The billowing furrow boring through the fog resolved
itself into a wolf, its shaggy form almost one with the heavy
mist.</p>

<p><em>Hopper?</em></p>

<p>The wolf hesitated, then came to stand beside him. It
was Hopper&mdash;he was certain&mdash;but something about the
wolf&rsquo;s stance, something in the yellow eyes that looked up briefly
to meet his, demanded silence, in mind as well as body. Those eyes
demanded that he follow, too.</p>

<p>He laid a hand on the wolf&rsquo;s back, and as he did,
Hopper started forward. He let himself be led. The fur under his
hand was thick and shaggy. It felt real.</p>

<p>The fog began to thicken, until only his hand told
him Hopper was still there, until a glance down did not even show
him his own chest. Just gray mist. He might as well have been
wrapped in new-sheared wool for all he could see. It struck him
that he had heard nothing, either. Not even the sound of his own
footsteps. He wiggled his toes, and was relieved to feel the boots
on his feet.</p>

<p>The gray became darker, and he and the wolf walked
through pitch-blackness. He could not see his hand when he touched
his nose. He could not see his nose, for that matter. He tried
closing his eyes for a moment, and could not tell any difference.
There was still no sound. His hand felt the rough hair of Hopper&rsquo;s
back, but he was not sure he could feel anything under his
boots.</p>

<p>Suddenly Hopper stopped, forcing him to halt, too. He
looked around&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and snapped his eyes shut. He could tell a
difference, now. And feel something, too, a queasy twisting of his
stomach. He made himself open his eyes and look down.</p>

<p>What he saw could not have been there, not unless he
and Hopper were standing in midair. He could see nothing of the
wolf or himself, as if neither had bodies at all&mdash;that
thought nearly tied his stomach into knots&mdash;but below him, as
clear as if lit by a thousand lamps, stretched a vast array of
mirrors, seemingly hanging in blackness though as level as if they
stood on a vast floor. They stretched as far as he could see in
every direction, but right beneath his feet, there was a clear
space. And people in it. Suddenly he could hear their voices as
well as if he had been standing among them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great Lord,&rdquo; one of the men muttered, &ldquo;where is this
place?&rdquo; He looked around once, flinching at his image cast back at
him many thousandfold, and held his eyes forward after that. The
others huddled around him seemed even more afraid. &ldquo;I was asleep in
Tar Valon, Great Lord. I <em>am</em> asleep in Tar Valon! Where is
this place? Have I gone mad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some of the men around him wore ornate coats full of
embroidery, others plainer garb, while some seemed to be naked, or
in their small-clothes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, too, sleep,&rdquo; a naked man nearly screamed. &ldquo;In
Tear. I remember lying down with my wife!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I do sleep in Illian,&rdquo; a man in red and gold
said, sounding shaken. &ldquo;I know that I do sleep, but that cannot be.
I know that I do dream, but that does be impossible. Where does
this be, Great Lord? Are you really come to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dark-haired man who faced them was garbed in
black, with silver lace at his throat and wrists. Now and again he
put a hand to his chest, as if it hurt him. There was light
everywhere down there, coming from nowhere, but this man below
Perrin seemed cloaked in shadow. Darkness rolled around him,
caressed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; The black-clothed man did not speak
loudly, but he had no need to. For the space of that word, he had
raised his head; his eyes and mouth were holes boring into a raging
forge-fire, all flame and fiery glow.</p>

<p>Perrin knew him, then. Ba&rsquo;alzamon. He was staring
down at Ba&rsquo;alzamon himself. Fear struck through him like hammered
spikes. He would have run, but he could not feel his feet.</p>

<p>Hopper shifted. He felt the thick fur under his hand
and gripped it hard. Something real. Something more real, he hoped,
than what he saw. But he knew that both were real.</p>

<p>The men huddling together cowered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been given tasks,&rdquo; Ba&rsquo;alzamon said. &ldquo;Some
of these tasks you have carried out. At others, you have failed.&rdquo;
Now and again his eyes and mouth vanished in flame again, and the
mirrors flashed with reflected fire. &ldquo;Those who have been marked
for death must die. Those who have been marked for taking must bow
to me. To fail the Great Lord of the Dark cannot be forgiven.&rdquo; Fire
shone through his eyes, and the darkness around him roiled and
spun. &ldquo;You.&rdquo; His finger pointed out the man who had spoken of Tar
Valon, a fellow dressed like a merchant, in plainly cut clothes of
the finest cloth. The others shied away from him as if he had
blackbile fever, leaving him to cower alone. &ldquo;You allowed the boy
to escape Tar Valon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man screamed, and began to quiver like a file
struck against an anvil. He seemed to become less solid, and his
scream thinned with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You all dream,&rdquo; Ba&rsquo;alzamon said, &ldquo;but what happens
in this dream is real.&rdquo; The shrieking man was only a bundle of mist
shaped like a man, his scream far distant, and then even the mist
was gone. &ldquo;I fear he will never wake.&rdquo; He laughed, and his mouth
roared flame. &ldquo;The rest of you will not fail me again. Begone!
Wake, and obey!&rdquo; The other men vanished.</p>

<p>For a moment Ba&rsquo;alzamon stood alone, then suddenly
there was a woman with him, clad all in white and silver.</p>

<p>Shock hit Perrin. He could never forget a woman so
beautiful. She was the woman from his dream, the one who had urged
him to glory.</p>

<p>An ornate silver throne appeared behind her, and she
sat, carefully arranging her silken skirts. &ldquo;You make free use of
my domain,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your domain?&rdquo; Ba&rsquo;alzamon said. &ldquo;You claim it yours,
then? Do you no longer serve the Great Lord of the Dark?&rdquo; The
darkness around him thickened for an instant, seemed to boil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I serve,&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;I have served the Lord
of the Twilight long. Long did I lie imprisoned for my service, in
an endless, dreamless sleep. Only Gray Men and Myrddraal are denied
dreams. Even Trollocs can dream. Dreams were always mine, to use
and walk. Now I am free again, and I will use what is mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is yours,&rdquo; Ba&rsquo;alzamon said. The blackness
swirling &rsquo;round him seemed mirthful. &ldquo;You always thought yourself
greater than you were, Lanfear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The name cut at Perrin like a newly honed knife. One
of the Forsaken had been in his dreams. Moiraine had been right.
Some of them were free.</p>

<p>The woman in white was on her feet, the throne gone.
&ldquo;I am as great as I am. What have your plans come to? Three
thousand years and more of whispering in ears and pulling the
strings of throned puppets like an Aes Sedai!&rdquo; Her voice invested
the name with all scorn. &ldquo;Three thousand years, and yet Lews Therin
walks the world again, and these Aes Sedai all but have him
leashed. Can you control him? Can you turn him? He was mine before
ever that straw-haired chit Ilyena saw him! He will be mine
again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you serve yourself now, Lanfear?&rdquo; Ba&rsquo;alzamon&rsquo;s
voice was soft, but flame raged continuously in his eyes and mouth.
&ldquo;Have you abandoned your oaths to the Great Lord of the Dark?&rdquo; For
an instant the darkness nearly obliterated him, only the glowing
fires showing through. &ldquo;They are not so easily broken as the oaths
to the Light you forsook, proclaiming your new master in the very
Hall of the Servants. Your master claims you forever, Lanfear. Will
you serve, or do you choose an eternity of pain, of endless dying
without release?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I serve.&rdquo; Despite her words, she stood tall and
defiant. &ldquo;I serve the Great Lord of the Dark and none other.
Forever!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The vast array of mirror began to vanish as if black
waves rolled in over it, ever closer to the center. The tide rolled
over Ba&rsquo;alzamon and Lanfear. There was only blackness.</p>

<p>Perrin felt Hopper move, and he was more than glad to
follow, guided only by the feel of fur under his head. It was not
until he was moving that he realized he could. He tried to puzzle
out what he had seen, without any success. Ba&rsquo;alzamon and Lanfear.
His tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth. For some reason, Lanfear
frightened him more than Ba&rsquo;alzamon did. Perhaps because she had
been in his dreams in the mountains. <em>Light! One of the Forsaken
in my dreams! Light!</em> And unless he had missed something, she
had defied the Dark One. He had been told and taught that the
Shadow could have no power over you if you denied it; but how could
a Darkfriend&mdash;not just a Darkfriend; one of the Forsaken!&mdash;defy the Shadow? <em>I must be mad, like Simion&rsquo;s brother.
These dreams have driven me mad!</em></p>

<p>Slowly the blackness became fog again, and the fog
gradually thinned until he walked out of it with Hopper onto a
grassy hillside bright with daylight. Birds began to sing from a
thicket at the foot of the hill. He looked back. A hilly plain
dotted with clumps of trees stretched to the horizon. There was no
sign of fog anywhere. The big, grizzled wolf stood watching
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; he demanded, struggling in his mind
to turn the question to thoughts the wolf could understand. &ldquo;Why
did you show it to me? What was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emotions and images flooded his thoughts, and his
mind put words to them. <em>What you must see. Be careful, Young
Bull. This place is dangerous. Be wary as a cub hunting
porcupine</em>. That came as something closer to Small Thorny Back,
but his mind named the animal the way he knew it as a man. <em>You
are too young, too new</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it real?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>All is real, what is seen, and what is not
seen</em>. That seemed to be all the answer Hopper was going to
give.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hopper, how are you here? I saw you die. I felt you
die!&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>All are here. All brothers and sisters that are,
all that were, all that will be</em>. Perrin knew that wolves did
not smile, not the way humans did, but for an instant he had the
impression that Hopper was grinning. <em>Here, I soar like the
eagle</em>. The wolf gathered himself and leaped, up into the air.
Up and up it carried him, until he dwindled to a speck in the sky,
and a last thought came. <em>To soar</em>.</p>

<p>Perrin stared after him with his mouth hanging open.
<em>He did it</em>. His eyes burned suddenly, and he cleared his
throat and scrubbed at his nose. <em>I will be crying like a girl,
next</em>. Without thinking, he looked around to see if anyone had
seen him, and that quickly everything changed.</p>

<p>He was standing on a rise, with shadowy, indistinct
dips and swells all around him. They seemed to fade into the
distance too soon. Rand stood below him. Rand, and a ragged circle
of Myrddraal and men and women his eyes seemed to slide right past.
Dogs howled somewhere in the distance, and Perrin knew they were
hunting something. Myrddraal scent and the stink of burned sulphur
filled the air. Perrin&rsquo;s hackles rose.</p>

<p>The circle of Myrddraal and people came closer to
Rand, all walking as if asleep. And Rand began to kill them. Balls
of fire flew from his hands and consumed two. Lightning flashed
from above to shrivel others. Bars of light like white-hot steel
flew from his fists to more. And the survivors continued to walk
slowly closer, as if none of them saw what was happening. One by
one they died, until none were left, and Rand sank down on his
knees, panting. Perrin was not sure whether he was laughing or
crying; it seemed to be some of each.</p>

<p>Shapes appeared over the rises, more people coming,
more Myrddraal, all intent on Rand.</p>

<p>Perrin cupped his hands to his mouth. &ldquo;Rand! Rand,
there are more coming!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand looked up at him from his crouch, snarling,
sweat slicking his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand, they&rsquo;re&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn you!&rdquo; Rand howled.</p>

<p>Light burned Perrin&rsquo;s eyes, and pain seared
everything.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Groaning, he rolled into a ball on the narrow bed,
the light still burning behind his eyelids. His chest hurt. He
raised a hand to it and winced when he felt a burn under his shirt,
a spot no bigger than a silver penny.</p>

<p>Bit by bit he forced his knotted muscles to let him
straighten his legs and lie flat in the dark cabin. <em>Moiraine. I
have to tell Moiraine this time. Just have to wait till the pain
goes away</em>.</p>

<p>But as the pain began to fade, exhaustion took him.
He barely had a thought that he must get up before sleep pulled him
down again.</p>

<p>When he opened his eyes again, he lay staring at the
beams overhead. Light at the top and bottom of the door told him
morning had come. He put a hand to his chest to convince himself he
had imagined it, imagined it so well that he had actually felt a
burn&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His fingers found the burn. <em>I didn&rsquo;t imagine it,
then</em>. He had dim memories of a few other dreams, fading even
as he recalled them. Ordinary dreams. He even felt as if he had had
a good night&rsquo;s sleep. <em>And could use another one right now</em>.
But it meant he could sleep. <em>As long as there are no wolves
around, anyway</em>.</p>

<p>He remembered making a decision in that brief waking
after the dream with Hopper, and after a moment he decided it had
been a good one.</p>

<p>It took knocking on five doors and being cursed at
twice&mdash;the inhabitants of two cabins had gone on deck&mdash;before he found Moiraine. She was fully dressed, but sitting on one
of the narrow beds cross-legged, reading in her book of notes by
lantern light. Back near the beginning, he saw, notes that must
have been made even before she had come to Emond&rsquo;s Field. Lan&rsquo;s
things were neatly placed on the other bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had a dream,&rdquo; he told her, and proceeded to tell
her of it. All of it. He even pulled up his shirt to show her the
small circle on his chest, red, with wavy red lines radiating from
it. He had kept things from her before, and he suspected he would
again, but this might be too important to hold back. The pin was
the smallest part of a pair of scissors, and the easiest made, but
without it, the scissors cut no cloth. When he was done, he stood
there waiting.</p>

<p>She had watched him without expression, except that
those dark eyes had examined every word as it came out of his
mouth, weighed it, measured it, held it up to the light. Now she
sat the same way, only it was he who was examined, weighed, and
held up to the light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, is it important?&rdquo; he demanded finally. &ldquo;I
think it was one of those wolf dreams you told me about&mdash;I&rsquo;m
sure it was; it must have been!&mdash;but that doesn&rsquo;t make what I
saw real. Only, you said maybe some of the Forsaken are free, and
he called her Lanfear, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Is it important, or am I standing
here making a fool out of myself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are women,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;who would do
their best to gentle you if they heard what I just did.&rdquo; His lungs
seemed to freeze; he could not breathe. &ldquo;I am not accusing you of
being able to channel,&rdquo; she went on, and the ice inside him melted,
&ldquo;or even of being able to learn. An attempt at gentling would not
harm you, beyond the rough treatment the Red Ajah would give you
before they realized their error. Such men are so rare, even the
Reds with all their hunting have not found more than three in the
last ten years. Before the outbreak of false Dragons, at least.
What I am trying to make clear to you is that I do not think you
will suddenly begin wielding the Power. You do not have to be
afraid of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, thank you very much for that,&rdquo; he said
bitterly. &ldquo;You did not have to scare me to death just so you could
tell me there was no need to be frightened!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you do have reason to be frightened. Or at least
careful, as the wolf suggested. Red sisters, or others, might kill
you before they discovered there was nothing to gentle in you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light! Light burn me!&rdquo; He stared at her with a
frown. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to lead me around by the nose, Moiraine, but
I am no calf, and there&rsquo;s no ring in my nose. The Red Ajah or any
other would not think of gentling unless there was something real
in what I dreamed. Does it mean the Forsaken are loose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you before that they might be. Some of them.
Your&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;dreams are nothing I expected, Perrin. Dreamers have
written of wolves, but I did not expect this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I think it was real. I think I saw something
that really happened, something I wasn&rsquo;t supposed to see.&rdquo; <em>What
you must see</em>. &ldquo;I think Lanfear is loose at the very least.
What are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to Illian. And then I will go to Tear,
and hope to reach it before Rand. We had need to leave Remen too
quickly for Lan to learn whether he crossed the river or went down
it. We should know before we reach Illian, though. We will find
sign if he has gone this way.&rdquo; She glanced at her book as if she
wanted to resume her reading.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that all you are going to do? With Lanfear loose,
and the Light alone knows how many of the others?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not question me,&rdquo; she said coldly. &ldquo;You do not
know which questions to ask, and you would comprehend less than
half the answers if I gave them. Which I will not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shifted his feet under her gaze until it became
clear she would say no more on the matter. His shirt rubbed
painfully at the burn on his chest. It did not seem a bad hurt&mdash;<em>Not for being struck by lightning it doesn&rsquo;t!</em>&mdash;but how he had come by it was another matter. &ldquo;Uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Will
you Heal this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you no longer uneasy about the One Power being
used on you, then, Perrin? No, I will not Heal it. It is not
serious, and it will remind you of the need to be careful.&rdquo; Careful
about pressing her, he knew, as well as about dreams or letting
others know of them. &ldquo;If there is nothing else, Perrin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He started for the door, then stopped. &ldquo;There is one
thing. If you knew a woman&rsquo;s name was Zarine, would you think it
meant anything about her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why under the Light do you ask this question?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A girl,&rdquo; he said awkwardly. &ldquo;A young woman. I met
her last night. She&rsquo;s one of the other passengers.&rdquo; He would let
her discover for herself that Zarine knew she was Aes Sedai. And
seemed to think following them would lead her to the Horn of
Valere. He would not keep back anything he thought was important,
but if Moiraine could be secretive, so could he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zarine. It is a Saldaean name. No woman would name
her daughter that unless she expected her to be a great beauty. And
a heartbreaker. One to lie on cushions in palaces, surrounded by
servants and suitors.&rdquo; She smiled, briefly but with great
amusement. &ldquo;Perhaps you have another reason to be careful, Perrin,
if there is a Zarine as a passenger with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I intend to be careful,&rdquo; he told her. At least he
knew why Zarine did not like her name. Hardly fitting for a Hunter
of the Horn. <em>As long as she doesn&rsquo;t call herself
&lsquo;falcon&rsquo;</em>.</p>

<p>When he went on deck, Lan was there, looking over
Mandarb. And Zarine was sitting on a coil of rope near the railing,
sharpening one of her knives and watching him. The big, triangular
sails were set and taut, and the <em>Snow Goose</em> flew
downriver.</p>

<p>Zarine&rsquo;s eyes followed Perrin as he walked by her to
stand in the bow. The water curled to either side of the prow like
earth turning around a good plow. He wondered about dreams and
Aielmen, Min&rsquo;s viewings and falcons. His chest hurt. Life had never
been as tangled as this.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Rand sat up out of his exhausted sleep, gasping, the
cloak he had used as a blanket falling away. His side ached, the
old wound from Falme throbbing. His fire had burned down to coals
with only a few wavering flames, but it was still enough to make
the shadows move. <em>That was Perrin. It was! It was</em> him,
<em>not a dream. Somehow. I almost killed him! Light, I have to be
careful!</em></p>

<p>Shivering, he picked up a length of oak branch and
started to shove it into the coals. The trees were scattered in
these Murandian hills, still close to the Manetherendrelle, but he
had found just enough fallen branches for his fire, the wood just
old enough to be properly cured but not rotten. Before the wood
touched the coals, he stopped. There were horses coming, ten or a
dozen of them, walking slowly. <em>I have to be careful. I cannot
make another mistake</em>.</p>

<p>The horses swung toward his failing fire, entered the
dim light, and stopped. The shadows obscured their riders, but most
seemed to be rough-faced men wearing round helmets and long leather
jerkins sewn all over with metal discs like fish scales. One was a
woman with graying hair and a no-nonsense look on her face. Her
dark dress was plain wool, but the finest weave, and adorned with a
silver pin in the shape of a lion. A merchant, she seemed to him;
he had seen her sort among those who came to buy tabac and wool in
the Two Rivers. A merchant and her guards.</p>

<p><em>I have to be careful</em>, he thought as he
stood. <em>No mistakes</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have chosen a good campsite, young man,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I have often used it on my way to Remen. There is a small
spring nearby. I trust you have no objection to my sharing it?&rdquo; Her
guards were already dismounting, hitching at their sword belts and
loosening saddle girths.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; Rand told her. <em>Careful</em>. Two steps
brought him close enough, and he leaped into the air, spinning&mdash;Thistledown Floats on the Whirlwind&mdash;heron-mark blade
carved from fire coming into his hands to take her head off before
surprise could even form on her face. <em>She was the most
dangerous</em>.</p>

<p>He alighted as the woman&rsquo;s head rolled from the
crupper of her horse. The guards yelled and clawed for their
swords, screamed as they realized his blade burned. He danced among
them in the forms Lan had taught him, and knew he could have killed
all ten with ordinary steel, but the blade he wielded was part of
him. The last man fell, and it had been so like practicing the
forms that he had already begun the sheathing called Folding the
Fan before he remembered he wore no scabbard and this blade would
have turned it to ash at a touch if he had.</p>

<p>Letting the sword vanish, he turned to examine the
horses. Most had run away, but some not far, and the woman&rsquo;s tall
gelding stood with rolling eyes, whickering uneasily. Her headless
corpse, lying on the ground, had maintained its grip on the reins,
and held the animal&rsquo;s head down.</p>

<p>Rand pulled them free, pausing only to gather his few
belongings before swinging into the saddle. <em>I have to be
careful</em>, he thought as he looked over the dead. <em>No
mistakes</em>.</p>

<p>The Power still filled him, the flow from <em>
saidin</em> sweeter than honey, ranker than rotted meat. Abruptly
he channeled&mdash;not really understanding what it was he did, or
how, only that it seemed right; and it worked, lifting the corpses.
He set them in a line, facing him, kneeling, faces in the dirt. For
those who had faces left. Kneeling to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I <em>am</em> the Dragon Reborn,&rdquo; he told them,
&ldquo;that is the way it is supposed to be, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Letting go of
<em>saidin</em> was hard, but he did it. <em>If I hold it too much,
how will I keep the madness away?</em> He laughed bitterly. <em>Or
is it too late for that?</em></p>

<p>Frowning, he peered at the line. He had been sure
there were only ten men, but eleven men knelt in that line, one of
them without armor of any sort but with a dagger still gripped in
his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You chose the wrong company,&rdquo; Rand told that
man.</p>

<p>Wheeling the gelding, he dug in his heels and set the
animal to a dead gallop into the night. It was a long way to Tear,
yet, but he meant to get there by the straightest way, if he had to
kill horses or steal them. <em>I will put an end to it. The
taunting. The baiting. I will end it!</em> Callandor. It
called to him.</p>
