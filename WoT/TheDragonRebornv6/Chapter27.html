<h4><em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
room Egwene had been given, on the same gallery
with Nynaeve and Elayne, was little different from Nynaeve&rsquo;s. Her
bed was a trifle wider, her table a little smaller. Her bit of rug
had flowers instead of scrolls. That was all. After the novices&rsquo;
quarters, it seemed like a room in a palace, but when the three of
them gathered there late that night, Egwene wished she were back in
the novice galleries, with no ring on her finger and no bands on
her dress. The others looked as nervous as she felt.</p>

<p>They had worked in the kitchens for two more meals,
and in between tried to puzzle out the meaning of what they had
found in the storeroom. Was it a trap, or an attempt to divert the
search? Did the Amyrlin know of the things, and if she did, why had
she not mentioned them? Talking provided no answers, and the
Amyrlin never appeared so they could ask her.</p>

<p>Verin had come into the kitchens after the midday
meal, blinking as if she were not sure why she was there. When she
saw Egwene and the other two on their knees among the cauldrons and
kettles, she looked surprised for a moment, then walked over and
asked, loud enough for anyone to hear, &ldquo;Have you found
anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne, with her head and shoulders inside a huge
soup kettle, banged her head on the rim backing out. Her blue eyes
seemed to take up her entire face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing but grease and sweat, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Nynaeve
said. The tug she gave her braid left a smear of greasy soap suds
on her dark hair, and she grimaced.</p>

<p>Verin nodded as if that were the answer she had been
seeking. &ldquo;Well, keep looking.&rdquo; She peered around the kitchen again,
frowning as though puzzled to find herself there, and left.</p>

<p>Alanna came to the kitchens after midday, too,
collecting a bowl of big green gooseberries and a pitcher of wine,
and Elaida, then Sheriam, appeared after supper, and Anaiya,
too.</p>

<p>Alanna had asked Egwene if she wanted to know more of
the Green Ajah, inquired when they were going to get on with their
studies. Just because the Accepted chose their own lessons and pace
did not mean they were not supposed to do any at all. The first few
weeks would be bad, of course, but they had to choose, or the
choosing would be done for them.</p>

<p>Elaida merely stood for a time, stern-faced and
staring at them, hands on her hips, and Sheriam did the same in
almost the identical pose. Anaiya stood the same way, but her look
was more concerned. Until she saw them glancing at her. Then her
face became a match for Elaida&rsquo;s and Sheriam&rsquo;s before her.</p>

<p>None of those visits meant anything that Egwene could
see. The Mistress of Novices certainly had reason to check on them,
as well as on the novices working in the kitchens, and Elaida had
reason to keep an eye on the Daughter-Heir of Andor. Egwene tried
not to think of the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s interest in Rand. As for Alanna,
she was not the only Aes Sedai who came for a tray to take back to
her rooms rather than eat with the others. Half the sisters in the
Tower were too busy for meals, too busy to take the time to summon
a servant to fetch a tray. And Anaiya&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Anaiya could well be
concerned for her Dreamer. Not that she would do anything to ease a
punishment set by the Amyrlin Seat herself. That could have been
Anaiya&rsquo;s reason for coming. It could have been.</p>

<p>Hanging her dress in the wardrobe, Egwene told
herself once again that even Verin&rsquo;s slip could have been perfectly
ordinary; the Brown sister was often absentminded. <em>If it was a
slip</em>. Sitting on the edge of her bed, she pulled up her shift
and began rolling down her stockings. She was almost beginning to
dislike white as much as she did gray.</p>

<p>Nynaeve stood in front of the fireplace with Egwene&rsquo;s
pouch in one hand, tugging her braid. Elayne sat by the table,
making nervous conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Green Ajah,&rdquo; the golden-haired woman said for what
Egwene thought must be the twentieth time since midday. &ldquo;I might
choose Green Ajah myself, Egwene. Then I can have three or four
Warders, perhaps marry one of them. Who better for Prince Consort
of Andor than a Warder? Unless it is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She trailed off,
blushing.</p>

<p>Egwene felt a pang of jealousy she thought she had
put down long ago, and sympathy mixed with it. <em>Light, how can I
be jealous when I cannot look at Galad without shivering and
feeling as if I am melting, both at the same time? Rand</em> was
<em>mine, but no more. I wish I could give him to you, Elayne, but
he is not for either of us, I think. It may be all well and good
for the Daughter-Heir to marry a commoner, as long as he&rsquo;s an
Andorman, but not to marry the Dragon Reborn</em>. She let the
stockings fall on the floor, telling herself there were more
important things to worry about tonight than neatness. &ldquo;I am ready,
Nynaeve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve handed her the pouch, and a long, thin strip
of leather. &ldquo;Perhaps it will work for more than one at once. I
could&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;go with you, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emptying the stone ring onto her palm, Egwene
threaded the leather strip through it, then tied it around her
neck. The stripes and flecks of blue and brown and red seemed more
vivid against the white of her shift. &ldquo;And leave Elayne to watch
over the both of us alone? When the Black Ajah may know us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can do it,&rdquo; Elayne said stoutly. &ldquo;Or let me go
with you, and Nynaeve can keep guard. She is the strongest of us,
when she&rsquo;s angry, and if there is need for a guard, you can be sure
she will be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene shook her head. &ldquo;What if it won&rsquo;t work for
two? What if two of us trying makes it not work at all? We would
not even know till we woke up, and then we&rsquo;ve wasted the night. We
cannot waste even one if we are to catch up. We&rsquo;re too far behind
them already.&rdquo; They were valid reasons, and she believed them, but
there was another, closer to her heart. &ldquo;Besides, I&rsquo;ll feel better
knowing both of you are watching over me, in case&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not want to say it. In case someone came
while she was asleep. The Gray Men. The Black Ajah. Any one of the
things that had turned the White Tower from a place of safety to a
dark woods full of pits and snares. Something coming in while she
lay there helpless. Their faces showed they understood.</p>

<p>As she stretched herself out on the bed and plumped a
feather pillow behind her head, Elayne moved the chairs, one to
either side of the bed. Nynaeve snuffed the candles one by one,
then, in the dark, sat in one of the chairs. Elayne took the
other.</p>

<p>Egwene closed her eyes and tried to think sleepy
thoughts, but she was too conscious of the thing lying between her
breasts. Far more conscious than of any soreness remaining from her
visit to Sheriam&rsquo;s study. The ring seemed to weigh as much as a
brick, now, and thoughts of home and quiet pools of water all slid
apart with remembrance of it. Of <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. The
Unseen World. The World of Dreams. Waiting just the other side of
sleep.</p>

<p>Nynaeve began to hum softly. Egwene recognized a
nameless, wordless tune her mother used to hum to her when she was
little. When she was lying in bed, in her own room, with a fluffy
pillow, and warm blankets, and the mingled smells of rose oil and
baking from her mother, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Rand, are you all right?
Perrin? Who was she?</em> Sleep came.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">She stood among rolling hills quilted with
wildflowers and dotted with small thickets of leafy trees in the
hollows and on the crests. Butterflies floated above the blossoms,
wings flashing yellow and blue and green, and two larks sang to
each other nearby. Just enough fluffy white clouds drifted in a
soft blue sky, and the breeze held that delicate balance between
cool and warm that came only a few special days in spring. It was a
day too perfect to be anything but a dream.</p>

<p>She looked at her dress, and laughed delightedly.
Exactly her favorite shade of sky-blue silk, slashed with white in
the skirt&mdash;that changed to green as she frowned momentarily&mdash;sewn with rows of tiny pearls down the sleeves and across
the bosom. She stuck out a foot just to peek at the toe of a velvet
slipper. The only jarring note was the twisted ring of multicolored
stone hanging around her neck on a leather cord.</p>

<p>She took the ring in her hand and gasped. It felt as
light as a feather. If she tossed it up, she was sure it would
drift away like thistle down. Somehow, she did not feel afraid of
it any longer. She tucked it inside the neck of her dress to get it
out of the way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So this is Verin&rsquo;s <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Corianin Nedeal&rsquo;s World of Dreams. It does not look
dangerous to me.&rdquo; But Verin had said it was. Black Ajah or not,
Egwene did not see how any Aes Sedai could tell a lie right out.
<em>She could be mistaken</em>. But she did not believe Verin
was.</p>

<p>Just to see if she could, she opened herself to the
One Power. <em>Saidar</em> filled her. Even here, it was present.
She channeled the flow lightly, delicately, directed it into the
breeze, swirling butterflies into fluttering spirals of color, into
circles linked with circles.</p>

<p>Abruptly she let it go. The butterflies settled back,
unconcerned by their brief adventure. Myrddraal and some other
Shadowspawn could sense someone channeling. Looking around, she
could not imagine such things in that place, but just because she
could not imagine them did not mean they were not there. And the
Black Ajah had all those <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> studied by Corianin
Nedeal. It was a sickening reminder of why she was there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least I know I can channel,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not learning anything standing here. Perhaps if I look around&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She took a step&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and was standing in the dank, dark hallway of
an inn. She was an innkeeper&rsquo;s daughter; she was sure it was an
inn. There was not a sound, and all the doors along the hall were
shut tight. Just as she wondered who was behind the plain wooden
door in front of her, it swung silently open.</p>

<p>The room within was bare, and cold wind moaned
through open windows, stirring old ash on the hearth. A big dog lay
curled up on the floor, shaggy tail across its nose, between the
door and a thick pillar of rough-cut, black stone that stood in the
middle of the floor. A large, shaggy-haired young man sat leaning
back against the pillar in only his smallclothes, head lolling as
if asleep. A massive black chain ran around the pillar and across
his chest, the ends gripped in his clenched hands. Asleep or not,
his heavy muscles strained to hold that chain tight, to prison
himself against the pillar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perrin?&rdquo; she said wonderingly. She stepped into the
room. &ldquo;Perrin, what&rsquo;s the matter with you? Perrin!&rdquo; The dog
uncurled itself and stood.</p>

<p>It was not a dog, but a wolf, all black and gray,
lips curling back from glistening white teeth, yellow eyes
regarding her as they might have a mouse. A mouse it meant to
eat.</p>

<p>Egwene stepped back hastily into the hall in spite of
herself. &ldquo;Perrin! Wake up! There&rsquo;s a wolf!&rdquo; Verin had said what
happened here was real, and showed the scar to prove it. The wolf&rsquo;s
teeth looked as big as knives. &ldquo;Perrin, wake up! Tell it I&rsquo;m a
friend!&rdquo; She embraced <em>saidar</em>. The wolf stalked nearer.</p>

<p>Perrin&rsquo;s head came up; his eyes opened drowsily. Two
sets of yellow eyes regarded her. The wolf gathered himself.
&ldquo;Hopper,&rdquo; Perrin shouted, &ldquo;no! Egwene!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door swung shut before her face, and total
darkness enveloped her.</p>

<p>She could not see, but she felt sweat beading on her
forehead. Not from heat. <em>Light, where am I? I don&rsquo;t like this
place. I want to wake up!</em></p>

<p>A whirring sound, and she jumped before she
recognized a cricket. A frog gave a bass croak in the darkness, and
a chorus answered it. As her eyes adapted, she dimly made out trees
all around her. Clouds blanketed the stars, and the moon was a thin
sliver.</p>

<p>Off to her right through the woods was another glow,
flickering. A campfire.</p>

<p>She considered a moment before moving. Wanting to
wake up had not been enough to take her way from <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, and she still had not found out anything
useful. And she had not been hurt in any way. <em>So far</em>, she
thought, shivering. But she had no idea who&mdash;or what&mdash;was at that campfire. <em>It could be Myrddraal. Besides, I&rsquo;m not
dressed for running around in the forest</em>. It was the last
thought that decided her; she prided herself on knowing when she
was being foolish.</p>

<p>Taking a deep breath, she gathered up her silken
skirts and crept closer. She might not have Nynaeve&rsquo;s skill at
woodcraft, but she knew enough to avoid stepping on dead twigs. At
last she peered carefully around the trunk of an old oak at the
campfire.</p>

<p>The only one there was a tall young man, sitting and
staring into the flames. Rand. Those flames did not burn wood. They
did not burn anything that she could see. The fire danced above a
bare patch of ground. She did not think they even scorched the
soil.</p>

<p>Before she could move, Rand raised his head. She was
surprised to see he was smoking a pipe, a thin ribbon of tabac
smoke lifting from the bowl. He looked tired, so very tired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s out there?&rdquo; he demanded loudly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
rustled enough leaves to wake the dead, so you might as well show
yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene&rsquo;s lips compressed, but she stepped out. <em>I
did not!</em> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, Rand. Do not be afraid. It is a dream. I
must be in your dreams.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was on his feet so suddenly that she stopped dead.
He seemed in some way larger than she remembered. And a touch
dangerous. Perhaps more than a touch. His blue-gray eyes seemed to
burn like frozen fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think I don&rsquo;t know it is a dream?&rdquo; he
sneered. &ldquo;I know that makes it no less real.&rdquo; He stared angrily out
into the darkness as if looking for someone. &ldquo;How long will you
try?&rdquo; he shouted at the night. &ldquo;How many faces will you send? My
mother, my father, now her! Pretty girls won&rsquo;t tempt me with a
kiss, not even one I know! I deny you, Father of Lies! I deny
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand,&rdquo; she said uncertainly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Egwene. I am
Egwene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a sword in his hands, suddenly, out of
nowhere. Its blade was worked out of a single flame, slightly
curved and graven with a heron. &ldquo;My mother gave me honeycake,&rdquo; he
said in a tight voice, &ldquo;with the smell of poison rank on it. My
father had a knife for my ribs. She&mdash;she offered kisses, and
more.&rdquo; Sweat slicked his face; his stare seemed enough to set her
afire. &ldquo;What do you bring?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are going to listen to me, Rand al&rsquo;Thor, if I
have to sit on you.&rdquo; She gathered <em>saidar</em>, channeled the
flows to make the air hold him in a net.</p>

<p>The sword spun in his hands, roaring like an open
furnace.</p>

<p>She grunted and staggered; it felt as if a rope
stretched too tight had broken and snapped back into her.</p>

<p>Rand laughed. &ldquo;I learn, you see. When it works&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;
He grimaced and started toward her. &ldquo;I could stand any face but
that one. Not her face, burn you!&rdquo; The sword flashed out.</p>

<p>Egwene fled.</p>

<p>She was not sure what it was she did, or how, but she
found herself back among the rolling hills under a sunny sky, with
larks singing and butterflies playing. She drew a deep, shuddering
breath.</p>

<p><em>I&rsquo;ve learned</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>What? That the Dark
One is still after Rand? I knew that already. That maybe the Dark
One wants to kill him? That&rsquo;s different. Unless maybe he&rsquo;s gone mad
already, and does not know what he is saying. Light, why couldn&rsquo;t I
help him? Oh, Light, Rand!</em></p>

<p>She took another long breath to calm herself. &ldquo;The
only way to help him is to gentle him,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;As well go
ahead and kill him.&rdquo; Her stomach twisted and knotted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never
do that. Never!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A redbird had perched on a cloudberry bush nearby,
crest lifting as it tilted its head to watch her cautiously. She
addressed the bird. &ldquo;Well, I am not helping anything standing here
talking to myself, am I? Or talking to you, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The redbird took wing as she stepped toward the bush.
It was still a flash of crimson as she took the next step, vanished
into a thicket she took a third.</p>

<p>She stopped and fished the stone ring on its cord out
of the front of her dress. Why was it not changing? Everything had
changed so fast up till now that she could hardly catch her breath.
Why not now? Unless there was some answer right here? She looked
around uncertainly. The wildflowers taunted her, and the larksong
mocked her. This place seemed too much of her own making.</p>

<p>Determined, she tightened her hand around the <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. &ldquo;Take me where I need to be.&rdquo; She shut her eyes
and concentrated on the ring. It was stone, after all; Earth should
give her some feeling for it. &ldquo;Do it. Take me where I need to be.&rdquo;
Once again she embraced <em>saidar</em>, fed a trickle of the One
Power into the ring. She knew it did not need any flow of Power
directed at it to work, and she did not try to do anything to it.
Only to give it more of the Power to use. &ldquo;Take me to where I can
find an answer. I need to know what the Black Ajah wants. Take me
to the answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve found your way at last, child. All
sorts of answers here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene&rsquo;s eyes snapped open. She stood in a great
hall, its vast domed ceiling supported by a forest of massive
redstone columns. And hanging in midair was a sword of crystal,
gleaming and sparkling as it slowly revolved. She was not certain,
but she thought it might be the sword Rand had been reaching for in
that dream. That other dream. This all felt so real, she had to
keep reminding herself it was a dream, too.</p>

<p>An old woman stepped out of the shadows of the
column, bent and hobbling with a stick. Ugly did not begin to
describe her. She had a bony, pointed chin, an even bonier, sharper
nose, and it seemed there were more warts growing hairs on her face
than there was face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Egwene said. The only people she had
seen so far in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> were those she already knew,
but she did not think she could have forgotten this poor old
woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just poor old Silvie, my Lady,&rdquo; the old woman
cackled. At the same time she managed a stoop that might have been
meant for a curtsy, or possibly a cringe. &ldquo;You know poor old
Silvie, my Lady. Served your family faithfully all these years.
Does this old face still frighten you? Don&rsquo;t let it, my Lady. It
serves me, when I need it, as good as a prettier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, it does,&rdquo; Egwene said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a strong
face. A good face.&rdquo; She hoped the woman believed it. Whoever this
Silvie was, she seemed to think she knew Egwene. Perhaps she knew
answers, too. &ldquo;Silvie, you said something about finding answers
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place for answers, my
Lady. The Heart of the Stone is full of answers. And secrets. The
High Lords would not be pleased to see us here, my Lady. Oh, no.
None but the High Lords enter here. And servants, of course.&rdquo; She
gave a sly, screeching laugh. &ldquo;The High Lords don&rsquo;t sweep and mop.
But who sees a servant?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of secrets?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Silvie was hobbling toward the crystal sword.
&ldquo;Plots,&rdquo; she said as if to herself. &ldquo;All of them pretending to
serve the Great Lord, and all the while plotting and planning to
regain what they lost. Each one thinking he or she is the only one
plotting. Ishamael is a fool!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Egwene said sharply. &ldquo;What did you say about
Ishamael?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman turned to present a crooked,
ingratiating smile. &ldquo;Just a thing poor folks say, my Lady. It turns
the Forsaken&rsquo;s power, calling them fools. Makes you feel good, and
safe. Even the Shadow can&rsquo;t take being called a fool. Try it, my
Lady. Say, Ba&rsquo;alzamon is a fool!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene&rsquo;s lips twitched on the edge of a smile.
&ldquo;Ba&rsquo;alzamon is a fool! You are right, Silvie.&rdquo; It actually did feel
good, laughing at the Dark One. The old woman chuckled. The sword
revolved just beyond her shoulder. &ldquo;Silvie, what is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Callandor</em>, my Lady. You know that, don&rsquo;t
you? The Sword That Cannot Be Touched.&rdquo; Abruptly she swung her
stick behind her; a foot from the sword, the stick stopped with a
dull <em>thwack</em> and bounded back. Silvie grinned wider. &ldquo;The Sword That
Is Not a Sword, though there&rsquo;s precious few knows what it is. But
none can touch it save one. They saw to that, who put it here. The
Dragon Reborn will hold <em>Callandor</em> one day, and prove to
the world he&rsquo;s the Dragon by doing it. The first proof, anyway.
Lews Therin come back for all the world to see, and grovel before.
Ah, the High Lords don&rsquo;t like having it here. They like nothing to
do with the Power. They&rsquo;d rid themselves of it, if they could. If
they could. I suppose there&rsquo;s others would take it, if they could.
What wouldn&rsquo;t one of the Forsaken give, to hold <em>
Callandor</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene stared at the sparkling sword. If the
Prophecies of the Dragon were true, if Rand was the Dragon as
Moiraine claimed, he would wield it one day, though from the rest
of what she knew of the Prophecies concerning <em>Callandor</em>,
she could not see how it could ever come to be. <em>But if there&rsquo;s
a way to take it, maybe the Black Ajah knows how. If they know it,
I can figure it out</em>.</p>

<p>Cautiously, she reached out with the Power, probing
at whatever held and shielded the sword. Her probe touched&mdash;something&mdash;and stopped. She could sense which of the Five
Powers had been used here. Air, and Fire, and Spirit. She could
trace the intricate weave made by <em>saidar</em>, set with a
strength that amazed her. There were gaps in that weave, spaces
where her probe should slide through. When she tried, it was like
fighting the strongest part of the weave head on. It hit her then,
what she was trying to force a way through, and she let her probe
vanish. Half that wall had been woven using <em>saidar</em>; the
other half, the part she could not sense or touch, had been made
with <em>saidin</em>. That was not it, exactly&mdash;the wall was
all of one piece&mdash;but it was close enough. <em>A stone wall
stops a blind woman as surely as one who can see it</em>.</p>

<p>Footsteps echoed in the distance. Boots.</p>

<p>Egwene could not tell how many there were, or from
which direction they were coming, but Silvie gave a start and
immediately stared off among the columns. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming to stare at
it again,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;Awake or asleep, he wants&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She
seemed to remember Egwene, and put on a worried smile. &ldquo;You must
leave, now, my Lady. He mustn&rsquo;t find you here, or even know you&rsquo;ve
been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene was already backing in among the columns, and
Silvie followed, flapping her hands and waving her stick. &ldquo;I am
going, Silvie. I just have to remember the way.&rdquo; She fingered the
stone ring. &ldquo;Take me back to the hills.&rdquo; Nothing happened: She
channeled a hairlike flow to the ring. &ldquo;Take me back to the hills.&rdquo;
The redstone columns still surrounded her. The boots were closer,
close enough not to be swallowed in their own echoes anymore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know the way out,&rdquo; Sylvie said flatly,
then went on in a near whisper, ingratiating and mocking at once,
an old retainer who felt she could take liberties. &ldquo;Oh, my Lady,
this is a dangerous place to come into, if you don&rsquo;t know the way
out. Come, let poor old Silvie take you out. Poor old Silvie will
tuck you safe in your bed, my Lady.&rdquo; She wrapped both arms around
Egwene, urging her further from the sword. Not that Egwene needed
much urging. The boots had stopped; he&mdash;whoever he was&mdash;was probably gazing at <em>Callandor</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just show me the way,&rdquo; Egwene whispered back. &ldquo;Or
tell me. There&rsquo;s no need to push.&rdquo; The old woman&rsquo;s fingers had
somehow gotten tangled around the stone ring. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch that,
Silvie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Safe in your bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pain annihilated the world.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">With a throat-wrenching shriek, Egwene sat up in the
dark, sweat rolling down her face. For a moment she had no idea
where she was, and did not care. &ldquo;Oh, Light,&rdquo; she moaned, &ldquo;that
hurt. Oh, Light, that hurt!&rdquo; She ran her hands over herself, sure
her skin must be scored or wealed to make such a burning, but she
could not find a mark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are here,&rdquo; Nynaeve&rsquo;s voice said from the
darkness. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here, Egwene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene threw herself toward the voice and wrapped her
arms around Nynaeve&rsquo;s neck in sheer relief. &ldquo;Oh, Light, I&rsquo;m back.
Light, I&rsquo;m back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elayne,&rdquo; Nynaeve said.</p>

<p>In a few moments one of the candles was giving a
small light. Elayne paused with the candle in hand and the spill
she had lit with flint and steel in the other. Then she smiled, and
every candle in the room burst into flame. She stopped at the
washstand and came back to the bed with a cool, damp cloth to wash
Egwene&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it bad?&rdquo; she asked worriedly. &ldquo;You never
stirred. You never mumbled. We did not know whether to wake you or
not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hurriedly, Egwene fumbled the leather cord from
around her neck and hurled it and the stone ring across the room.
&ldquo;Next time,&rdquo; she panted, &ldquo;we decide on a time, and you wake me
after it. Wake me if you have to stick my head in a basin of
water!&rdquo; She had not realized that she had decided there would be a
next time. <em>Would you put your head in a bear&rsquo;s mouth just to
show you weren&rsquo;t afraid? Would you do it twice just because you&rsquo;d
done it once and didn&rsquo;t die?</em></p>

<p>Yet it was more than a matter of proving to herself
that she was not afraid. She <em>was</em> afraid, and knew it. But
so long as the Black Ajah had those <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> Corianin
had studied, she would have to keep going back. She was sure the
answer to why they wanted them lay in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. If
she could find answers about the Black Ajah there perhaps other
answers, too, if half what she had been told about Dreaming were
true&mdash;she had to go back. &ldquo;But not tonight,&rdquo; she said softly.
&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked. &ldquo;What did you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;dream?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene lay back on the bed and told them. Of it all,
the only thing she left out was about Perrin talking to the wolf.
She left the wolf out altogether. She felt a little guilty about
keeping secrets from Elayne and Nynaeve, but it was Perrin&rsquo;s secret
to tell, when and if he chose, not hers. The rest she gave them
word for word, describing everything. When she was done, she
felt emptied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aside from being tired,&rdquo; Elayne said, &ldquo;did he look
hurt? Egwene, I cannot believe he would ever hurt you. I cannot
believe he would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand,&rdquo; Nynaeve said dryly, &ldquo;will have to look after
himself awhile longer.&rdquo; Elayne blushed; she looked pretty doing it.
Egwene realized that Elayne looked pretty doing anything, even
crying, or scrubbing pots. &ldquo;<em>Callandor</em>,&rdquo; Nynaeve continued.
&ldquo;The Heart of the Stone. That was marked on the plan. I think we
know where the Black Ajah is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne had regained her poise. &ldquo;It does not change
the trap,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If it is not a diversion, it is a trap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve smiled grimly. &ldquo;The best way to catch whoever
set a trap is to spring it and wait for him to come. Or her, in
this instance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean go to Tear?&rdquo; Egwene said, and Nynaeve
nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Amyrlin has cut us loose, it seems. We make our
own decisions, remember? At least we know the Black Ajah is in
Tear, and we know who to look for there. Here, all we can do is sit
and stew in our own suspicions of everybody, wonder if there is
another Gray Man out there. I would rather be the hound than the
rabbit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to write to my mother,&rdquo; Elayne said. When she
saw the looks they gave her, her voice became defensive. &ldquo;I have
already vanished once without her knowing where I was. If I do it
again&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;You do not know Mother&rsquo;s temper. She could send Gareth
Bryne and the whole army against Tar Valon. Or hunting after
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could stay here,&rdquo; Egwene said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I will not let you two go alone. And I won&rsquo;t
stay here wondering if the sister teaching me is a Darkfriend, or
if the next Gray Man will come after me.&rdquo; She gave a small laugh.
&ldquo;I will not work in the kitchens while you two are off adventuring,
either. I just have to tell my mother than I am out of the Tower on
the Amyrlin&rsquo;s orders, so she won&rsquo;t become furious if she hears
rumors. I do not have to tell her where we are going, or why.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You surely had better not,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. &ldquo;She very
likely would come after you if she knew about the Black Ajah. For
that matter, you can&rsquo;t know how many hands your letter will pass
through before it reaches her, or what eyes might read it. Best not
to say anything you don&rsquo;t mind anyone knowing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s another thing.&rdquo; Elayne sighed. &ldquo;The Amyrlin
does not know I am one of you. I have to find some way to send it
with no chance of her seeing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will have to think on that.&rdquo; Nynaeve&rsquo;s brows
furrowed. &ldquo;Perhaps once we&rsquo;re on our way. You could leave it at
Aringill on the way downriver, if we have time to find someone
there going to Caemlyn. A sight of one of those papers the Amyrlin
gave us might convince somebody. We will have to hope they work on
ship captains, too, unless one of you has more coin than I have.&rdquo;
Elayne shook her head dolefully.</p>

<p>Egwene did not even bother. What money they had
possessed had all gone on the journey from Toman Head, except for a
few coppers each. &ldquo;When&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She had to stop and clear her
throat. &ldquo;When do we leave? Tonight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve looked as if she were considering it for a
moment, but then she shook her head. &ldquo;You need sleep, after&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;
Her gesture took in the stone ring lying where it had bounced off
the wall. &ldquo;We will give the Amyrlin one more chance to seek us out.
When we finish with breakfast, you both pack what you want to take,
but keep it light. We have to leave the Tower without anyone
noticing, remember. If the Amyrlin doesn&rsquo;t reach us by midday, I
mean to be on a trading ship, shoving that paper down the captain&rsquo;s
throat if need be, before Prime sounds. How does that sound to you
two?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sounds excellent,&rdquo; Elayne said firmly, and Egwene
said, &ldquo;Tonight or tomorrow, the sooner the better, as far as I can
see.&rdquo; She wished she sounded as confident as Elayne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we had best get some sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve,&rdquo; Egwene said in a small voice, &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I
don&rsquo;t want to be alone tonight.&rdquo; It pained her to make that
admission.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, either,&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;I keep thinking
about the Soulless. I do not know why, but they frighten me even
more than the Black Ajah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; Nynaeve said slowly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really
want to be alone, myself.&rdquo; She eyed the bed where Egwene lay. &ldquo;That
looks big enough for three, if everybody keeps her elbows to
herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Later, when they were shifting about trying to find a
way to lie that did not feel so crowded, Nynaeve suddenly
laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Egwene asked. &ldquo;You are not that
ticklish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just thought of someone who&rsquo;d be happy to carry
Elayne&rsquo;s letter for her. Happy to leave Tar Valon, too. In fact,
I&rsquo;d bet on it.&rdquo;</p>
