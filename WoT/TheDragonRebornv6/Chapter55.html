<h4><em>What Is Written in Prophecy</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">R</span>and
entered the chamber slowly, walking among the
great polished redstone columns he remembered from his dreams.
Silence filled the shadows, yet something called to him. And
something flashed ahead, a momentary light throwing back shadow, a
beacon. He stepped out beneath a great dome, and saw what he
sought. <em>Callandor</em>, hanging hilt down in midair, waiting
for no hand but that of the Dragon Reborn. As it revolved, it broke
what little light there was into splinters, and now and then it
flared as if with a light of its own. Calling him. Waiting for
him.</p>

<p><em>If I am the Dragon Reborn. If I am not just some
half-mad man cursed with the ability to channel, a puppet dancing
for Moiraine and the White Tower</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take it, Lews Therin. Take it, Kinslayer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spun to face the voice. The tall man with
close-cropped white hair who stepped from the shadows among the
columns was familiar to him. Rand had no idea who he was, this
fellow in a red silk coat with black stripes down its puffy sleeves
and black breeches tucked into elaborately silver-worked boots. He
did not know the man, but he had seen him in his dreams. &ldquo;You put
them in a cage,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Egwene, and Nynaeve, and Elayne. In my
dreams. You kept putting them in a cage, and hurting them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man made a dismissive gesture of his hand. &ldquo;They
are less than nothing. Perhaps one day, when they have been
trained, but not now. I confess surprise that you cared enough to
make them useful. But you were ever a fool, ever ready to follow
your heart before power. You came too soon, Lews Therin. Now you
must do what you are not yet ready for, or else die. Die, knowing
you have left these women you care for in my hands.&rdquo; He seemed to
be waiting for something, expectant. &ldquo;I mean to use them more,
Kinslayer. They will serve me, serve my power. And that will hurt
them far more than anything they have suffered before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Behind Rand, <em>Callandor</em> flashed, throwing one
pulse of warmth against his back. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not remember me, do you?&rdquo; The white-haired
man laughed suddenly. &ldquo;I do not remember you, either, looking this
way. A country lad with a flute case on his back. Did Ishamael
speak the truth? He was ever one to lie when it gained him an inch
or a second. Do you remember nothing, Lews Therin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A name!&rdquo; Rand demanded. &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call me Be&rsquo;lal.&rdquo; The Forsaken scowled when Rand did
not react to the name. &ldquo;Take it!&rdquo; Be&rsquo;lal snapped, throwing a hand
toward the sword behind Rand. &ldquo;Once we rode to war side by side,
and for that I give you a chance. A bare chance, but a chance to
save yourself, a chance to save those three I mean to make my pets.
Take the sword, <em>country man</em>. Perhaps it will be enough to
help you survive me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand laughed. &ldquo;Do you believe you can frighten me so
easily, Forsaken? Ba&rsquo;alzamon himself has hunted me. Do you think I
will cower now for you? Grovel before a Forsaken when I have denied
the Dark One to his face?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that what you think?&rdquo; Be&rsquo;lal said softly. &ldquo;Truly,
you know nothing.&rdquo; Suddenly there was a sword in his hands, a sword
with a blade carved from black fire. &ldquo;Take it! Take <em>
Callandor</em>! Three thousand years, while I lay imprisoned, it
has waited there. For you. One of the most powerful <em>
sa&rsquo;angreal</em> we ever made. Take it, and defend yourself, if you
can!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He moved toward Rand as if to drive him back toward
<em>Callandor</em>, but Rand raised his own
hands&mdash;<em>saidin</em> filled him; sweet rushing flow of the
Power; stomach-wrenching vileness of the taint&mdash;and he held a
sword wrought from red flame, a sword with a heron-mark on its
fiery blade. He stepped into the forms Lan had taught him till he
flowed from one to the next as if in a dance. Parting the Silk.
Water Flows Downhill. Wind and Rain. Blade of black fire met blade
of red in showers of sparks, roars like white-hot metal
shattering.</p>

<p>Rand came back smoothly into a guard stance, trying
not to let his sudden uncertainty show. A heron stood on the black
blade, too, a bird so dark as to be nearly invisible. Once he had
faced a man with a heron-mark blade of steel, and barely survived.
He knew that he himself had no real right to the blademaster&rsquo;s
mark; it had been on the sword his father had given him, and when
he thought of a sword in his hands, he thought of that sword. Once
he had embraced death, as the Warder had taught, but this time, he
knew, his death would be final. Be&rsquo;lal was better than he with the
sword. Stronger. Faster. A true blademaster.</p>

<p>The Forsaken laughed, amused, swinging his blade in
quick flourishes to either side of him; the black fire roared as if
swift passage through the air quickened it. &ldquo;You were a greater
swordsman, once, Lews Therin,&rdquo; he said mockingly. &ldquo;Do you remember
when we took that tame sport called swords and learned to kill with
it, as the old volumes said men once had? Do you remember even one
of those desperate battles, even one of our dire defeats? Of course
not. You remember nothing, do you? This time you have not learned
enough. This time, Lews Therin, I will kill you.&rdquo; Be&rsquo;lal&rsquo;s mockery
deepened. &ldquo;Perhaps if you take <em>Callandor</em>, you might extend
your life a little longer. A little longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He came forward slowly, almost as if to give Rand
time to do just that, turn and race to <em>Callandor</em>, to the
Sword That Cannot Be Touched, to take it. But the doubts were still
strong in Rand. <em>Callandor</em> could only be touched by the
Dragon Reborn. He had allowed them to proclaim him so for a hundred
reasons that seemed to leave him no choice at the time. But was he
truly the Dragon Reborn? If he raced to touch <em>Callandor</em> in
truth, not in a dream, would his hand meet an invisible wall while
Be&rsquo;lal cut him down from behind?</p>

<p>He met the Forsaken with the sword he knew, the blade
of fire wrought with <em>saidin</em>. And was driven back. The
Falling Leaf met Watered Silk. The Cat Dances on the Wall met the
Boar Rushes Downhill. The River Undercuts the Bank nearly lost him
his head, and he had to throw himself inelegantly to one side with
black flame brushing his hair, rolling to his feet to confront the
Stone Falls From the Mountain. Methodically, deliberately, Be&rsquo;lal
drove him back in a spiral that slowly tightened on <em>
Callandor</em>.</p>

<p>Shouts echoed among the columns, screams, the clash
of steel, but Rand barely heard. He and Be&rsquo;lal were no longer alone
in the Heart of the Stone. Men in breastplates and rimmed helmets
fought with swords against shadowy, veiled shapes that darted among
the columns with short spears stabbing. Some of the soldiers formed
a rank; arrows flashing out of the dimness took them in the throat,
the face, and they died in their line. Rand hardly noticed the
fighting, even when men fell dead within paces of him. His own
fight was too desperate; it took all of his concentration. Wet
warmth trickled down his side. The old wound was breaking open.</p>

<p>He stumbled suddenly, not seeing the dead man at his
feet until he was lying on his back atop his flute case on the
stone floor.</p>

<p>Be&rsquo;lal raised his blade of black fire, snarling.
&ldquo;Take it! Take <em>Callandor</em> and defend yourself? Take it, or
I will kill you now! If you will not take it, I will slay you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even Be&rsquo;lal gave a start at the command in that
woman&rsquo;s voice. The Forsaken stepped back out of the arc of Rand&rsquo;s
sword and turned his head to frown at Moiraine as she came striding
through the battle, her eyes fixed on him, ignoring the screaming
deaths around her. &ldquo;I thought you were neatly out of the way,
woman. No matter. You are only an annoyance. A stinging fly. A
biteme. I will cage you with the others, and teach you to serve the
Shadow with your puny powers,&rdquo; he finished with a contemptuous
laugh, and raised his free hand.</p>

<p>Moiraine had not stopped or slowed while he spoke.
She was no more than thirty paces from him when he moved his hand,
and she raised both of hers as well.</p>

<p>There was an instant of surprise on the Forsaken&rsquo;s
face, and he had time to scream &ldquo;No!&rdquo; Then a bar of white fire
hotter than the sun shot from the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s hands, a glaring rod
that banished all shadows. Before it, Be&rsquo;lal became a shape of
shimmering motes, specks dancing in the light for less than a
heartbeat, flecks consumed before his cry faded.</p>

<p>There was silence in the chamber as that bar of light
vanished, silence except for the moans of the wounded. The fighting
had stopped dead, veiled men and men in breastplates alike standing
as if stunned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was right concerning one thing,&rdquo; Moiraine said,
as coolly serene as if she were standing in a meadow. &ldquo;You must
take <em>Callandor</em>. He meant to slay you for it, but it is
your birthright. Better by far that you knew more before your hand
held that hilt, yet you have come to the point now, and there is no
further time for learning. Take it, Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whips of black lightning curled around her; she
screamed as they lifted her, hurled her to slide along the floor
like a sack until she came up against one of the columns.</p>

<p>Rand stared up at where the lightning had come from.
There was a deeper shadow up there, near the top of the columns, a
blackness that made all other shadows look like noonday, and from
it, two eyes of fire stared back at him.</p>

<p>Slowly the shadow descended, resolving into
Ba&rsquo;alzamon, clothed in dead black, like a Myrddraal&rsquo;s black. Yet
even that was not so dark as the shadow that clung to him. He hung
in the air, two spans above the floor, glaring at Rand with a rage
as fierce as his eyes. &ldquo;Twice in this life I have offered you the
chance to serve me living.&rdquo; Flames leaped in his mouth as he spoke,
and every word roared like a furnace. &ldquo;Twice you have refused, and
wounded me. Now you will serve the Lord of the Grave in death. Die,
Lews Therin Kinslayer. Die, Rand al&rsquo;Thor. It is time for you to
die! I take your soul!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Ba&rsquo;alzamon put forth his hand, Rand pushed himself
up, threw himself desperately toward <em>Callandor</em>, still
glittering and flashing in midair. He did not know whether he could
reach it, or touch it if he did, but he was sure it was his only
chance.</p>

<p>Ba&rsquo;alzamon&rsquo;s blow struck him as he leapt, struck
inside him, a ripping and crumpling, tearing something loose,
trying to pull a part of him away. Rand screamed. He felt as if he
were collapsing like an empty sack, as if he were being turned
inside out. The pain in his side, the wound taken at Falme, was
almost welcome, something to hang onto, a reminder of life. His
hand closed convulsively. On <em>Callandor</em>&rsquo;s hilt.</p>

<p>The One Power surged through him, a torrent greater
than he could believe, from <em>saidin</em> into the sword. The
crystal blade shone brighter than even Moiraine&rsquo;s fire had. It was
impossible to look at, impossible any longer to see that it was a
sword, only that light blazed in his fist. He fought the flow,
wrestled with the implacable tide that threatened to carry him, all
that was really him, into the sword with it. For a heartbeat that
took centuries he hung, wavering, balanced on the brink of being
scoured away like sand before a flash flood. With infinite slowness
the balance firmed. It was still as though he stood barefoot on a
razor&rsquo;s edge above a bottomless drop, yet something told him this
was the best that could be expected. To channel this much of the
Power, he must dance on that sharpness as he had danced the forms
of the sword.</p>

<p>He turned to face Ba&rsquo;alzamon. The tearing within him
had ceased as soon as his hand touched <em>Callandor</em>. Only an
instant had passed, yet it seemed to have lasted forever. &ldquo;You will
not take my soul,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;This time, I mean to finish it once
and for all! I mean to finish it now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ba&rsquo;alzamon fled, man and shadow vanishing.</p>

<p>For a moment Rand stared, frowning. There had been a
sense of&mdash;folding&mdash;as Ba&rsquo;alzamon left. A twisting, as
if Ba&rsquo;alzamon had in some way <em>bent</em> what was. Ignoring the men
staring at him, ignoring Moiraine crumpled at the column base, Rand
reached out, through <em>Callandor</em>, and twisted reality to
make a door to somewhere else. He did not know to where, except
that it was where Ba&rsquo;alzamon had gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the hunter now,&rdquo; he said, and stepped
through.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The stone shook under Egwene&rsquo;s feet. The Stone shook;
it rang. She caught her balance and stopped, listening. There was
no more sound, no other tremor. Whatever had happened, it was over.
She hurried on. A door of iron bars stood in her way, with a lock
as big as her head. She channeled Earth before she reached it, and
when she pushed against the bars, the lock tore in half.</p>

<p>She walked quickly across the chamber beyond it,
trying not to look at the things hanging on the walls. Whips and
iron pincers were the most innocuous. With a small shudder she
pushed open a smaller iron gate and entered a corridor lined with
rough wooden doors, rush torches burning at intervals in iron
brackets; she felt almost as much relief at leaving those things
behind as she did at finding what she sought. <em>But which
cell?</em></p>

<p>The wooden doors opened easily. Some were unlocked,
and the locks on the others lasted no longer than that larger lock
had earlier. But every cell was empty. <em>Of course. No one would
dream themselves in this place. Any prisoner who managed to
reach</em> <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> <em>would dream of a pleasanter
place</em>.</p>

<p>For a moment she felt something close to despair. She
had wanted to believe that finding the right cell would make a
difference. Even finding it could be impossible, though. This first
corridor stretched on and on, and others joined it.</p>

<p>Suddenly she saw something flicker just ahead of her.
A shape even less substantial than Joiya Byir had been. It had been
a woman, though. She was sure of that. A woman seated on a bench
beside one of the cell doors. The image flickered into being again,
and was gone. There was no mistaking that slender neck and the
pale, innocent-appearing face with its eyelids fluttering on the
edge of sleep. Amico Nagoyin was drifting toward sleep, dreaming of
her guard duties. And apparently toying drowsily with one of the
stolen <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. Egwene could understand that; it had
been a great effort to stop using the one Verin had given her, even
for a few days.</p>

<p>She knew it was possible to cut a woman off from the
True Source even if she had already embraced <em>saidar</em>, but
severing a weave already established had to be much harder than
damming the flow before it began. She set the patterns of the
weaving, readied them, making the threads of Spirit much stronger,
this time, thicker and heavier, a denser weave with a cutting edge
like a knife.</p>

<p>The wavering shape of the Darkfriend appeared again,
and Egwene struck out with the flows of Air and Spirit. For an
instant something seemed to resist the weaving of Spirit, and she
forced it with all of her might. It slid into place.</p>

<p>Amico Nagoyin screamed. It was a thin sound, barely
heard, as faint as she herself was, and she seemed almost like a
shadow of what Joiya Byir had been. Yet the bonds woven of Air held
her; she did not vanish again. Terror twisted the Darkfriend&rsquo;s
lovely face; she seemed to be babbling, but her shouts were
whispers too soft for Egwene to understand.</p>

<p>Tying and setting the weaves around the Black sister,
Egwene turned her attentions to the cell door. Impatiently, she let
Earth flood into the iron lock. It fell away in black dust, in a
mist that dissolved completely before it struck the floor. She
swung open the door, and was not surprised to find the cell empty
except for one burning rush torch.</p>

<p><em>But Amico is bound, and the door is
open</em>.</p>

<p>For a moment she thought of what to do next. Then she
stepped out of the dream&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and woke to all her bruises and aches and
thirst, to the wall of the cell against her back, staring at the
tightly shut cell door. <em>Of course. What happens to living
things there is real when they wake. What I did to stone or iron or
wood has no effect in the waking world</em>.</p>

<p>Nynaeve and Elayne were still kneeling beside
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoever is out there,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, &ldquo;screamed a few
moments ago, but nothing else has happened. Did you find a way
out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We should be able to walk out,&rdquo; Egwene said. &ldquo;Help
me to my feet, and I will get rid of the lock. Amico will not
trouble us. That scream was her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne shook her head. &ldquo;I have been trying to embrace
<em>saidar</em> ever since you left. It is different, now, but I am
still cut off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene formed the emptiness inside her, became the
rosebud opening to <em>saidar</em>. The invisible wall was still
there. It shimmered now. There were moments when she almost thought
she could feel the True Source beginning to fill her with the
Power. Almost. The shield wavered in and out of existence too fast
for her to detect. It might as well have still been solid.</p>

<p>She stared at the other two women. &ldquo;I bound her. I
shielded her. She is a living thing, not lifeless iron. She must be
shielded still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Some</em>thing has happened to the shield set on
us,&rdquo; Elayne said, &ldquo;but Amico is still managing to hold it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene let her head sag back against the wall. &ldquo;I
will have to try again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you strong enough?&rdquo; Elayne grimaced. &ldquo;To be
blunt, you sound even weaker than you did before. This try took
something out of you, Egwene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am strong enough there.&rdquo; She did feel more weary,
less strong, but it was their only chance that she could see. She
said as much, and their faces said they agreed with her, however
reluctantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you go to sleep again so soon?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked
finally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sing to me.&rdquo; Egwene managed a smile. &ldquo;Like when I
was a little girl. Please?&rdquo; Holding Nynaeve&rsquo;s hand with one of
hers, the stone ring clasped in the other, she closed her eyes and
tried to find sleep in the wordless humming tune. </p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The wide door of iron bars stood open, and the room
beyond seemed empty of life, but Mat entered cautiously. Sandar was
still out in the hall, trying to peer both ways at once, certain
that a High Lord, or maybe a hundred Defenders or so, would appear
at any moment.</p>

<p>There were no men in the room now&mdash;and by the
looks of the half-eaten meals on a long table, they had left
hurriedly; no doubt because of the fighting above&mdash;and from
the looks of the things on the walls, he was just as glad he did
not have to meet any of them. Whips in different sizes and lengths,
different thicknesses, with different numbers of tails. Pincers,
and tongs, and clamps, and irons. Things that looked like metal
boots, and gauntlets, and helmets, with great screws all over them
as if to tighten them down. Things he could not even begin to guess
the use of. If he had met the men who used these things, he thought
he would surely have checked that <em>they</em> were dead before he
walked away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sandar!&rdquo; he hissed. &ldquo;Are you going to stay out there
all bloody night!&rdquo; He hurried to the inner door&mdash;barred like
the outer, but smaller&mdash;without waiting for an answer, and
went through.</p>

<p>The hall beyond was lined by rough wooden doors, and
lit by the same rush torches as the room he had just left. No more
than twenty paces from him, a woman sat on a bench beside one of
the doors, leaning back against the wall in a curiously stiff
fashion. She turned her head slowly toward him at the sound of his
boots grating on the stone. A pretty young woman. He wondered why
she did not move more than her head, and why even that moved as if
she were half-asleep.</p>

<p>Was she a prisoner? <em>Out in the hall? But nobody
with a face like that could be one of the people who uses the
things on those walls</em>. She did look almost asleep, with her
eyes only partly open. And the suffering on that lovely face surely
made her one of the tortured, not a torturer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Sandar shouted behind him. &ldquo;She is Aes Sedai!
She is one of those who took the women you seek!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat froze in the middle of a step, staring at the
woman. He remembered Moiraine hurling balls of fire. He wondered if
he could deflect a ball of fire with his quarterstaff. He wondered
if his luck extended to outrunning Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help me,&rdquo; she said faintly. Her eyes still looked
nearly asleep, but the pleading in her voice was fully awake. &ldquo;Help
me. Please!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat blinked. She still had not moved a muscle below
her neck. Cautiously, he stepped closer, waving to Sandar to stop
his groaning about her being Aes Sedai. She moved her head to
follow him. No more than that.</p>

<p>A large iron key hung at her belt. For a moment he
hesitated. Aes Sedai, Sandar said. <em>Why doesn&rsquo;t she move?</em>
Swallowing, he eased the key free as carefully as if he were trying
to take a piece of meat from a wolfs jaws. She rolled her eyes
toward the door beside her and made a sound like a cat that had
just seen a huge dog come snarling into the room and knew there was
no way out.</p>

<p>He did not understand it, but as long as she did not
try to stop him opening that door, he did not care why she just sat
there like a stuffed scarecrow. On the other hand, he wondered if
there was something on the other side worth being afraid of. <em>If
she is one of those who took Egwene and the others, it stands to
reason she&rsquo;s guarding them</em>. Tears leaked from the woman&rsquo;s
eyes. <em>Only she looks like it&rsquo;s a bloody Halfman in there</em>.
But there was only one way to find out. Propping his staff against
the wall, he turned the key in the lock and flung open the door,
ready to run if need be.</p>

<p>Nynaeve and Elayne were kneeling on the floor with
Egwene apparently asleep between them. He gasped at the sight of
Egwene&rsquo;s swollen face, and changed his mind about her sleeping. The
other two women turned toward him as he opened the door&mdash;they
were almost as battered as Egwene; <em>Burn me! Burn me!</em>&mdash;looked at him, and gaped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Matrim Cauthon,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, sounding shocked,
&ldquo;what under the Light are <em>you</em> doing here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came to bloody rescue you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Burn me if I
expected to be greeted as if I had come to steal a pie. You can
tell me why you look as if you&rsquo;d been fighting bears later, if you
want. If Egwene cannot walk, I&rsquo;ll carry her on my back. There are
Aiel all over the Stone, or near enough, and either they are
killing the bloody Defenders or the bloody Defenders are killing
them, but whichever way it is, we had better get out of here while
we bloody well can. <em>If</em> we can!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mind your language,&rdquo; Nynaeve told him, and Elayne
gave him one of those disapproving stares women were so good at.
Neither one seemed to have her full attention in it, though. They
began shaking Egwene as if she were not covered with more bruises
than he had ever seen in his life.</p>

<p>Egwene&rsquo;s eyelids fluttered open, and she groaned.
&ldquo;Why did you wake me? I must understand it. If I loose the bonds on
her, she will wake and I&rsquo;ll never catch her again. But if I do not,
she cannot go all the way to sleep, and&mdash;&rdquo; Her eyes fell on
him and widened. &ldquo;Matrim Cauthon, what under the Light are <em>you</em> doing here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You tell her,&rdquo; he told Nynaeve. &ldquo;I am too busy
trying to rescue you to watch my langu&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were all staring beyond him, glaring as if they
wished they had knives in their hands.</p>

<p>He spun, but all he saw was Juilin Sandar, looking as
if he had swallowed a rotten plum whole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have cause,&rdquo; he told Mat. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I betrayed
them. But I had to.&rdquo; That was addressed past Mat to the women. &ldquo;The
one with many honey-colored braids spoke to me, and I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I had
to do it.&rdquo; For a long moment the three continued to stare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Liandrin has vile tricks, Master Sandar,&rdquo; Nynaeve
said finally. &ldquo;Perhaps you are not entirely to blame. We can
apportion guilt later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that is all cleared up,&rdquo; Mat said, &ldquo;could we go
now?&rdquo; It was as clear as mud to him, but he was more interested in
leaving right then.</p>

<p>The three women limped after him into the hall, but
they stopped around the woman on the bench. She rolled her eyes at
them and whimpered. &ldquo;Please. I will come back to the Light. I will
swear to obey you. With the Oath Rod in my hands I will swear.
Please do not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat jumped as Nynaeve suddenly reared back and swung
a fist, knocking the woman completely off the bench. She lay there,
her eyes closed all the way finally, but even lying on her side she
was still in exactly the same position she had been in on the
bench.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is gone,&rdquo; Elayne said excitedly.</p>

<p>Egwene bent to rummage in the unconscious woman&rsquo;s
pouch, transferring something Mat could not make out to her own.
&ldquo;Yes. It feels wonderful. Something changed about her when you hit
her, Nynaeve. I do not know what, but I felt it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne nodded. &ldquo;I felt it, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like to change every last thing about her,&rdquo;
Nynaeve said grimly. She took Egwene&rsquo;s head in her hands; Egwene
rose onto her toes, gasping. When Nynaeve took her hands away to
put them on Elayne, Egwene&rsquo;s bruises were gone. Elayne&rsquo;s vanished
as quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blood and bloody ashes!&rdquo; Mat growled. &ldquo;What do you
mean hitting a woman who was just sitting there? I don&rsquo;t think she
could even move!&rdquo; They all three turned to look at him, and he made
a strangled sound as the air seemed to turn to thick jelly around
him. He lifted into the air, until his boots dangled a good pace
above the floor. <em>Oh, burn me, the Power! Here I was afraid that
Aes Sedai would use the bloody Power on me, and now the bloody
women I&rsquo;m rescuing do it! Burn me!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not understand anything, Matrim Cauthon,&rdquo;
Egwene said in a tight voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Until you do understand,&rdquo; Nynaeve said in an even
tighter, &ldquo;I suggest you keep your opinions to yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne contented herself with a glare that made him
think of his mother going out to cut a switch.</p>

<p>For some reason he found himself giving them the grin
that had so often sent his mother after that switch. <em>Burn me,
if they can do this, I don&rsquo;t see how anybody ever locked them in
that cell in the first place!</em> &ldquo;What I understand is that I got
you out of something you couldn&rsquo;t get yourselves out of, and you
all have as much gratitude as a bloody Taren Ferry man with a
toothache!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, and his boots suddenly
hit the floor so hard his teeth jarred. But he could move again.
&ldquo;As much as it pains me to say it, Mat, you are right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was tempted to answer something sarcastic, but
there was barely enough apology in her voice as it was. &ldquo;Now can we
go? With the fighting going on, Sandar thinks he and I can take you
out by a small gate near the river.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not leaving just yet, Mat,&rdquo; Nynaeve said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean to find Liandrin and skin her,&rdquo; Egwene said,
sounding almost as if she meant it literally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All I want to do,&rdquo; Elayne said, &ldquo;is pound Joiya Byir
till she squeals, but I will settle for any of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you all deaf?&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;There is a battle
going on out there! I came here to rescue you, and I mean to rescue
you.&rdquo; Egwene patted his cheek as she walked by him, and so did
Elayne. Nynaeve merely sniffed. He stared after them with his mouth
hanging open. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you say something?&rdquo; he growled at the
thief-catcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw what speaking earned you,&rdquo; Sandar said simply.
&ldquo;I am no fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am not staying in the middle of a battle!&rdquo;
he shouted at the women. They were just disappearing through the
small, barred door. &ldquo;I am leaving, do you hear?&rdquo; They did not even
look back. <em>Probably get themselves killed out there! Somebody
will stick a sword in them while they&rsquo;re looking the other
way!</em> With a snarl, he put his quarterstaff across his shoulder
and started after. &ldquo;Are you going to stand there?&rdquo; he called to the
thief-catcher. &ldquo;I did not come this far to let them die now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sandar caught up to him in the room with the whips.
The three women were already gone, but Mat had a feeling they would
not be too hard to find. <em>Just find the men bloody hanging in
midair! Bloody women!</em> He quickened his pace to a trot.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Perrin strode down the halls of the Stone grimly,
searching for some sign of Faile. He had rescued her twice more,
now, breaking her out of an iron cage once, much like the one that
had held the Aiel in Remen, and once breaking open a steel chest
with a falcon worked on its side. Both times she had melted into
air after saying his name. Hopper trotted by his side, sniffing the
air. As sharp as Perrin&rsquo;s nose was, the wolf&rsquo;s was sharper; it had
been Hopper who led them to the chest.</p>

<p>Perrin wondered whether he was ever going to free her
in truth. There had not been any sign in a long time, it seemed.
The halls of the Stone were empty, lamps burning, tapestries and
weapons hanging on the walls, but nothing moved except himself and
Hopper. <em>Except I think that was Rand</em>. It had only been a
glimpse, a man running as if chasing someone. <em>It could not be
him. It couldn&rsquo;t, but I think it was</em>.</p>

<p>Hopper quickened his steps suddenly, heading for
another set of tall doors, these clad in bronze. Perrin tried to
match the pace, stumbled, and fell to his knees, throwing out a
hand to catch himself short of dropping on his face. Weakness
washed through him as if all his muscles had gone to water. Even
after the feeling receded, it took some of his strength with it. It
was an effort to struggle to his feet. Hopper had turned to look at
him.</p>

<p><em>You are here too strongly, Young Bull. The flesh
weakens. You do not care to hold on to it enough. Soon flesh and
dream will die together</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Find her,&rdquo; Perrin said. &ldquo;That is all I ask. Find
Faile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yellow eyes met yellow eyes. The wolf turned and
trotted to the doors. <em>Beyond here, Young Bull</em>.</p>

<p>Perrin reached the doors and pushed. They did not
budge. There seemed to be no way to open them, no handles, nothing
to grip. There was a tiny pattern worked into the metal, so fine
his eyes almost did not see it. Falcons. Thousands of tiny
falcons.</p>

<p><em>She has to be here. I do not think I can last
much longer</em>. With a shout, he swung his hammer against the
bronze. It rang like a great gong. Again he struck, and the peal
deepened. A third blow, and the bronze doors shattered like
glass.</p>

<p>Within, a hundred paces from the broken doors, a
circle of light surrounded a falcon chained to a perch. Darkness
filled all the rest of that vast chamber, darkness and faint
rustlings as of hundreds of wings.</p>

<p>He took a step into the room, and a falcon stooped
out of the murk, talons scoring his face as it passed. He threw an
arm across his eyes&mdash;talons tore at his forearm&mdash;and
staggered toward the perch. Again and again the birds came, falcons
diving, striking him, tearing him, but he lumbered on with blood
pouring down his arms and shoulders, that one arm protecting the
eyes he had fixed on the falcon on the perch. He had lost the
hammer; he did not know where, but he knew that if he went back to
search, he would die before he found it.</p>

<p>As he reached the perch, the slicing talons drove him
to his knees. He peered up under his arm at the falcon on the
perch, and she stared back with dark, unblinking eyes. The chain
that held her leg was fastened to the perch with a tiny lock shaped
like a hedgehog. He seized the chain with both hands, careless of
the other falcons that now became a whirlwind of cutting talons
around him, and with his last strength snapped it. Pain and the
falcons brought darkness.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">He opened his eyes to stinging agony, as if his face
and arms and shoulders had been sliced with a thousand knives. It
did not matter. Faile was kneeling over him, those dark, tilted
eyes filled with worry, wiping his face with a cloth already soaked
in his blood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My poor Perrin,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;My poor
blacksmith. You are hurt so badly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With an effort that cost more pain, he turned his
head. This was the private dining room in the Star, and near one
leg of the table lay a wooden carving of a hedgehog, broken in
half. &ldquo;Faile,&rdquo; he whispered to her. &ldquo;My falcon.&rdquo;</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Rand was still in the Heart of the Stone, but it was
different. There were no men fighting here, no dead men, no one at
all but himself. Abruptly the sound of a great gong rang through
the Stone, then again, and the very stones beneath his feet
resonated. A third time the booming came, but cut off abruptly, as
if the gong had shattered. All was still.</p>

<p><em>Where is this place?</em> he wondered. <em>More
important, where is Ba&rsquo;alzamon?</em></p>

<p>As if to answer him, a blazing shaft like the one
Moiraine had made shot out of the shadows among the columns,
straight toward his chest. His wrist twisted the sword
instinctively; it was instinct as much as anything else that made
him loose flows from <em>saidin</em> into <em>Callandor</em>, a
flood of the Power that made the sword blaze brighter even than
that bar streaking at him. His uncertain balance between existence
and destruction wavered. Surely that torrent would consume him.</p>

<p>The shaft of light struck the blade of <em>
Callandor</em>&mdash;and parted on its edge, forking to stream
past on either side. He felt his coat singe from its near passage,
smelled the wool beginning to burn. Behind him, the two prongs of
frozen fire, of liquid light, struck huge redstone columns; where
they struck, stone ceased to exist, and the burning bars bored
through to other columns, severing those instantaneously as well.
The Heart of the Stone rumbled as columns fell and shattered in
clouds of dust, sprays of stone fragments. What fell into the
light, however, simply was not, anymore.</p>

<p>A snarl of rage came from the shadows, and the
blazing shaft of pure white heat vanished.</p>

<p>Rand swung <em>Callandor</em> as if he were striking
at something in front of him. The white light obscuring the blade
extended, blazed ahead, and sheared through the redstone column
that hid the snarl. The polished stone sliced like silk. The
severed column trembled; part of it tore loose and dropped from the
ceiling, smashing into huge, jagged chunks on the floor. As the
rumbling faded, he heard beyond it the sound of boots on stone.
Running.</p>

<p><em>Callandor</em> at the ready, Rand hurried after
Ba&rsquo;alzamon.</p>

<p>The tall archway leading out of the Heart collapsed
as he reached it, the entire wall falling in clouds of dust and
rock as if to bury him, but he threw the Power at it, and all
became dust floating in the air. He ran on. He was not sure what he
had done, or how, but he had no time to think on it. He ran after
Ba&rsquo;alzamon&rsquo;s retreating footsteps, echoing down the halls of the
Stone.</p>

<p>Myrddraal and Trollocs leaped out of thin air, huge
bestial shapes and eyeless faces distorted with a rage to kill, in
hundreds, so they jammed the hall before him and behind,
scythe-like swords and blades of deadly black steel seeking his
blood. Without knowing how, he turned them to vapor that parted
before him&mdash;and vanished. The air around him suddenly became
choking soot, clogging his nostrils, shutting off breath, but he
made it fresh air again, a cool mist. Flames leaped from the floor
beneath his feet, spurted from the walls, the ceiling, furious jets
that flashed tapestries and rugs, tables and chests to wisps of
ash, flung ornaments and lamps ahead of them as drops of molten,
burning gold; he smashed the fires flat, hardened them into a red
glaze on the rock.</p>

<p>The stones around him faded almost to mist; the Stone
faded. Reality trembled; he could feel it unraveling, feel himself
unraveling. He was being pushed out of the here, into some other
place where nothing existed at all. <em>Callandor</em> blazed in
his hands like the sun till he thought it would melt. He thought he
himself would melt from the surge of the One Power through him, the
flood that he somehow directed into sealing up the hole that had
opened around him, into holding himself on the side of existence.
The Stone became solid again.</p>

<p>He could not even begin to imagine what it was that
he did. The One Power raged inside him till he barely knew himself,
till he barely was himself, till what was himself almost did not
exist. His precarious stability teetered. To either side lay the
endless fall, obliteration by the Power that coursed through him
into the sword. Only in the dance along the razor&rsquo;s sharp edge was
there even an uncertain safety. <em>Callandor</em> shone in his
fist until it seemed he carried the sun. Dimly within him,
fluttering like a candle flame in a storm, was the surety that
holding <em>Callandor</em>, he could do anything. Anything.</p>

<p>Through endless corridors he ran, dancing along the
razor, chasing the one who would slay him, the one he must slay.
There could be no other end, this time. This time one of them must
die! That Ba&rsquo;alzamon knew it as well was clear. Always he fled,
always staying ahead of sight so that only the sounds of his flight
drew Rand on, but even fleeing he turned this Stone of Tear that
was not the Stone of Tear against Rand, and Rand fought back with
instinct and guesses and chance, fought and ran down that knife
edge in perfect balance with the Power, the tool and weapon that
would consume him utterly if he faltered.</p>

<p>Water filled the halls from top to bottom, thick and
black as the bottom of the sea, choking off breath. He made it air
again, unknowingly, and ran on, and suddenly the air gained weight
until it seemed every inch of his skin supported a mountain,
squeezing in from all directions. In the instant before he was
crushed to nothingness he chose tides out of the flood of Power
raging through him&mdash;he did not know how or which or why; it
was too fast for thought or knowing&mdash;and the pressure
vanished. He pursued Ba&rsquo;alzamon, and the very air was abruptly
solid rock encasing him, then molten stone, then nothing at all to
fill his lungs. The ground beneath his boots pulled at him as if
every pound suddenly weighed a thousand, then all weight vanished
so that a step left him spinning in midair. Unseen maws gaped to
rip his mind from his body, to tear away his soul. He sprang each
trap and ran on; what Ba&rsquo;alzamon twisted to destroy him, he made
right without being aware of how. Vaguely he knew that in some way
he had brought things back into natural balance, forced them into
line with his own dance down that impossibly thin divide between
existence and nothingness, but that knowledge was distant. All his
awareness lay in the pursuit, the hunt, the death that must end
it.</p>

<p>And then he was in the Heart of the Stone again,
stalking through the rubbled gap that had been a wall. Some of the
columns hung like broken teeth, now. And Ba&rsquo;alzamon backed away
from him, eyes burning, shadow cloaking him. Black lines like steel
wires seemed to run off from Ba&rsquo;alzamon into the darkness mounding
around him, vanishing into unimaginable heights and distances
within that blackness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not be undone!&rdquo; Ba&rsquo;alzamon cried. His mouth
was fire; his shriek echoed among the columns. &ldquo;I cannot be
defeated! Aid me!&rdquo; Some of the darkness shrouding him drifted into
his hands, formed into a ball so black it seemed to soak up even
the light of <em>Callandor</em>. Sudden triumph blazed in the
flames of his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are destroyed!&rdquo; Rand shouted. <em>Callandor</em>
spun in his hands. Its light roiled the darkness, severed the
steel-black lines around Ba&rsquo;alzamon, and Ba&rsquo;alzamon convulsed. As
if there were two of him he seemed to dwindle and grow larger at
the same time. &ldquo;You are undone!&rdquo; Rand plunged the shining blade
into Ba&rsquo;alzamon&rsquo;s chest.</p>

<p>Ba&rsquo;alzamon screamed, and the fires of his face flared
wildly. &ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; he howled. &ldquo;The Great Lord of the Dark can never be
defeated!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand pulled <em>Callandor</em>&rsquo;s blade free as
Ba&rsquo;alzamon&rsquo;s body sagged and began to fall, the shadow around him
vanishing.</p>

<p>And suddenly Rand was in another Heart of the Stone,
surrounded by columns still whole, and fighting men screaming and
dying, veiled men and men in breastplates and helmets. Moiraine
still lay crumpled at the base of a redstone column. And at Rand&rsquo;s
feet lay the body of a man, sprawled on its back with a hole burned
through the chest. He might have been a handsome man in his middle
years, except that where his eyes and mouth should have been were
only pits from which rose tendrils of black smoke.</p>

<p><em>I have done it</em>, he thought. <em>I have
killed Ba&rsquo;alzamon, killed Shai&rsquo;tan! I have won the Last Battle!
Light, I AM the Dragon Reborn! The breaker of nations, the Breaker
of the World. No! I will END the breaking, end the killing! I will
MAKE it end!</em></p>

<p>He raised <em>Callandor</em> above his head. Silver
lightning crackled from the blade, jagged streaks arching toward
the great dome above. &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he shouted. The fighting
ceased; men stared at him in wonder, over black veils, from beneath
the rims of round helmets. &ldquo;I am Rand al&rsquo;Thor!&rdquo; he called,
so his voice rang through the chamber. &ldquo;I am the Dragon
Reborn!&rdquo; <em>Callandor</em> shone in his grasp.</p>

<p>One by one, veiled men and helmeted, they knelt to
him, crying, &ldquo;The Dragon is Reborn! The Dragon is Reborn!&rdquo;</p>
