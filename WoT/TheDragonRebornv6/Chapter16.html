<h4><em>Hunters Three</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">N</span>ynaeve&rsquo;s
room was considerably larger than the
novice rooms. She had a real bed, not one built into the wall, two
ladder-back armchairs instead of a stool, and a wardrobe for
her clothes. The furnishings were all plain, suitable for a
middling successful farmer&rsquo;s house, but compared to the novices,
the Accepted lived in luxury. There was even a small rug, woven
with scrolls of yellow and red on blue. The room was not empty when
Egwene and Nynaeve entered.</p>

<p>Elayne stood in front of the fireplace, arms crossed
beneath her breasts and eyes red at least partly from anger. Two
tall young men sprawled in the chairs, all arms and legs. One, with
his dark green coat undone to show a snowy shirt, shared Elayne&rsquo;s
blue eyes and red-gold hair, and his grinning face marked him
plainly as her brother. The other, Nynaeve&rsquo;s age and with his gray
coat neatly buttoned, was slender and dark of hair and eye. He
rose, all sure confidence and lithely muscled grace, when Egwene
and Nynaeve came in. He was, Egwene thought not for the first time,
the most handsome man she had ever seen. His name was Galad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is good to see you again,&rdquo; he said, taking her
hand. &ldquo;I have worried much over you. We have worried much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her pulse quickened, and she took back her hand
before he should feel it. &ldquo;Thank you, Galad,&rdquo; she murmured. <em>
Light, but he&rsquo;s beautiful</em>. She told herself to stop thinking
that way. It was not easy. She found herself smoothing her dress,
wishing he were seeing her in silk instead of this plain white
wool, perhaps even one of those Domani dresses Min had told her of,
the ones that clung and seemed so thin you thought they must be
transparent even though they were not. She flushed furiously and
banished the image from her mind, willed him to look away from her
face. It did not help that half the women in the Tower, from
scullery maids to Aes Sedai themselves, looked at him as if they
had the same thoughts. It did not help that his smile seemed for
her alone. In fact, his smile made it worse. <em>Light, if he even
suspected what I was thinking, I&rsquo;d die!</em></p>

<p>The golden-haired young man leaned forward in his
chair. &ldquo;The question is, where have you been? Elayne dodges my
questions as if she has a pocket full of figs and doesn&rsquo;t want me
to have any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have told you, Gawyn,&rdquo; Elayne said in a tight
voice, &ldquo;it is none of your affair. I came here,&rdquo; she added to
Nynaeve, &ldquo;because I did not want to be alone. They saw me, and
followed. They would not take no for an answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t they,&rdquo; Nynaeve said flatly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is our affair, sister,&rdquo; Galad said. &ldquo;Your
safety is very much our affair.&rdquo; He looked at Egwene, and she felt
her heart jump. &ldquo;The safety of all of you is very important to me.
To us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not your sister,&rdquo; Elayne snapped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you want company,&rdquo; Gawyn told Elayne with a
smile, &ldquo;we can do as well as any. And after what we went through
just to be here, we deserve some explanation of where you&rsquo;ve been.
I would rather let Galad thump me all over the practice yard all
day than face Mother again for a single minute. I&rsquo;d rather have
Coulin mad at me.&rdquo; Coulin was Master of Arms, and kept a tight
discipline among the young men who came to train at the White Tower
whether they aspired to become Warders or just to learn from
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Deny the connection if you will,&rdquo; Galad told Elayne
gravely, &ldquo;but it is still there. And Mother put your safety in our
hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gawyn grimaced. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll have our hides, Elayne, if
anything happens to you. We had to talk fast, or she&rsquo;d have hauled
us back home with her. I have never heard of a queen sending her
own sons to the headsman, but Mother sounded ready to make an
exception if we don&rsquo;t bring you home safely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; Elayne said, &ldquo;that your fast talk was
all for me. None of it was meant to let you stay here studying with
the Warders.&rdquo; Gawyn&rsquo;s face reddened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your safety was our first concern.&rdquo; Galad sounded as
if he meant it, and Egwene was sure he did. &ldquo;We managed to convince
Mother that if you did return here, you would need someone to look
after you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look after me!&rdquo; Elayne exclaimed, but Galad went on
smoothly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The White Tower has become a dangerous place. There
have been deaths&mdash;murders&mdash;with no real explanations.
Even some Aes Sedai have been killed, though they have tried to
keep that quiet. And I have heard rumors of the Black Ajah, spoken
in the Tower itself. By Mother&rsquo;s command, when it is safe for you
to leave your training, we are to return you to Caemlyn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For answer, Elayne lifted her chin and half turned
away from him.</p>

<p>Gawyn ran a hand through his hair in frustration.
&ldquo;Light, Nynaeve, Galad and I are not villains. All we want to do is
help. We would do it anyway, but Mother commanded it, so there&rsquo;s no
chance of you talking us out of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Morgase&rsquo;s commands carry no weight in Tar Valon,&rdquo;
Nynaeve said in a level voice. &ldquo;As for your offer of help, I will
remember it. Should we need help, you will be among the first to
hear of it. For now, I wish you to leave.&rdquo; She gestured pointedly
to the door, but he ignored her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all very well, but Mother will want to know
Elayne has come back. And why she ran off without a word, and what
she was doing these months. Light, Elayne! The whole Tower was in a
turmoil. Mother was half-crazed with fear. I thought she&rsquo;d tear the
Tower down with her bare hands.&rdquo; Elayne&rsquo;s face took on a measure of
guilt, and Gawyn pressed his advantage. &ldquo;You owe her that much,
Elayne. You owe me that much. Burn me, you&rsquo;re being as stubborn as
stone. You&rsquo;ve been gone for months, and all I know about it is that
you&rsquo;ve run afoul of Sheriam. And the only reasons I know that much
are because you&rsquo;ve been crying and you won&rsquo;t sit down.&rdquo; Elayne&rsquo;s
indignant stare said he had squandered whatever momentary advantage
he might have had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. Galad and Gawyn opened their
mouths. She raised her voice. &ldquo;I said enough!&rdquo; She glared at them
until it was clear their silence would hold, then went on. &ldquo;Elayne
owes the two of you nothing. Since she chooses to tell you nothing,
that is that. Now, this is my room, not the common room of an inn,
and I want you out of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Elayne&mdash;&rdquo; Gawyn began at the same time
that Galad said, &ldquo;We only want&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve spoke loudly enough to drown them out. &ldquo;I
doubt you asked permission to enter the Accepted&rsquo;s quarters.&rdquo; They
stared at her, looking surprised. &ldquo;I thought not. You will be out
of my room, out of my sight, before I count three, or I will write
a note to the Master of Arms about this. Coulin Gaidin has a much
stronger arm than Sheriam Sedai, and you may be assured that I will
be there to see he makes a proper job of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve, you wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; Gawyn began worriedly,
but Galad motioned him to silence and stepped closer to
Nynaeve.</p>

<p>Her face kept its stern expression, but she
unconsciously smoothed the front of her dress as he smiled down at
her. Egwene was not surprised. She did not think she had met a
woman outside the Red Ajah who would not be affected by Galad&rsquo;s
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I apologize, Nynaeve, for our forcing ourselves on
you unwanted,&rdquo; he said smoothly. &ldquo;We will go, of course. But
remember that we are here if you need us. And whatever caused you
to run away, we can help with that, as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve returned his smile. &ldquo;One,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Galad blinked, his smile fading. Calmly, he turned to
Egwene. Gawyn got up and started for the door. &ldquo;Egwene,&rdquo; Galad
said, &ldquo;you know that you, especially, can call on me at any time,
for anything. I hope you know that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two,&rdquo; Nynaeve said.</p>

<p>Galad gave her an irritated look. &ldquo;We will talk
again,&rdquo; he told Egwene, bowing over her hand. With a last smile, he
took an unhurried step toward the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thrrrrrrrrr&rdquo;&mdash;Gawyn darted through the door,
and even Galad&rsquo;s graceful stride quickened markedly&mdash;&ldquo;ree,&rdquo;
Nynaeve finished as the door banged shut behind them.</p>

<p>Elayne clapped her hands delightedly. &ldquo;Oh, well
done,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Very well done. I did not even know men were
forbidden the Accepted&rsquo;s quarters, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Nynaeve said dryly, &ldquo;but those louts
did not know it, either.&rdquo; Elayne clapped her hands again and
laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have let them just leave,&rdquo; Nynaeve added, &ldquo;if Galad
had not made such a show of taking his time about it. That young
man has too fair a face for his own good.&rdquo; Egwene almost laughed at
that; Galad was no more than a year younger than Nynaeve, if that,
and Nynaeve was straightening her dress again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Galad!&rdquo; Elayne sniffed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll bother us again, and
I do not know whether your trick will work more than once. He does
what he sees as right no matter who it hurts, even himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I will think of something else,&rdquo; Nynaeve said.
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford to have them looking over our shoulders all the
time. Elayne, if you wish, I can make a salve that will soothe
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne shook her head, then lay down across the bed
with her chin in her hands. &ldquo;If Sheriam found out, we would no
doubt both have yet another visit to her study to look forward to.
You have not said very much, Egwene. Cat caught your tongue?&rdquo; Her
expression became grimmer. &ldquo;Or perhaps Galad has?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene blushed in spite of herself. &ldquo;I simply did not
choose to argue with them,&rdquo; she said in as dignified a tone as she
could manage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Elayne said grudgingly. &ldquo;I will admit
that Galad is good-looking. But he is horrid, too. He <em>
always</em> does right, as he sees it. I know that does not sound
horrid, but it is. He has never disobeyed Mother, not in the
smallest thing that I know of. He will not tell a lie, even a small
one, or break a rule. If he turns you in for breaking one, there
isn&rsquo;t the slightest spite in it&mdash;he seems sad you could not
live up to his standards, if anything&mdash;but that doesn&rsquo;t
change the fact that he <em>will</em> turn you in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That sounds&mdash;uncomfortable,&rdquo; Egwene
said carefully, &ldquo;but not horrid. I cannot imagine Galad doing
anything horrid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne shook her head, as if in disbelief that Egwene
found it so hard to see what was clear to her. &ldquo;If you want to pay
attention to someone, try Gawyn. He is nice enough&mdash;most of
the time&mdash;and he&rsquo;s besotted with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gawyn! He has never looked at me twice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not, you fool, the way you stare at Galad
until your eyes look ready to fall out of your face.&rdquo; Egwene&rsquo;s
cheeks felt hot, but she was afraid it might well be true. &ldquo;Galad
saved his life when Gawyn was a child,&rdquo; Elayne went on. &ldquo;Gawyn will
never admit he is interested in a woman if Galad is interested in
her, but I have heard him talk about you, and I know. He never
could hide things from me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is nice to know,&rdquo; Egwene said, then laughed at
Elayne&rsquo;s grin. &ldquo;Perhaps I can get him to say some of those things
to me instead of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could choose Green Ajah, you know. Green sisters
sometimes marry. Gawyn truly is besotted, and you would be good for
him. Besides, I would like to have you for a sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you two are finished with girlish chatter,&rdquo;
Nynaeve cut in, &ldquo;there are important matters to talk about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Elayne said, &ldquo;such as what the Amyrlin Seat
had to say to you after I left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would rather not talk about that,&rdquo; Egwene said
awkwardly. She did not like lying to Elayne. &ldquo;She did not say
anything that was pleasant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne gave a sniff of disbelief. &ldquo;Most people think
I get off easier than the others because I am Daughter-Heir of
Andor. The truth is that if anything, I catch it harder than the
rest because I&rsquo;m Daughter-Heir. Neither of you did anything I did
not, and if the Amyrlin had harsh words for you, she would have
twice as harsh for me. Now, what did she say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must keep this just between us three,&rdquo; Nynaeve
said. &ldquo;The Black Ajah&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve!&rdquo; Egwene exclaimed. &ldquo;The Amyrlin said Elayne
was to be left out of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Black Ajah!&rdquo; Elayne almost shouted, scrambling
up to kneel in the middle of the bed. &ldquo;You cannot leave me out
after telling me this much. I won&rsquo;t be left out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never meant for you to be,&rdquo; Nynaeve assured her.
Egwene could only stare at her in amazement. &ldquo;Egwene, it was you
and I who Liandrin saw as a threat. It was you and I who were just
nearly killed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nearly killed?&rdquo; Elayne whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;perhaps because we are still a threat, and
perhaps because they already know that we were closeted alone with
the Amyrlin, and even what she told us. We need someone with us who
they do not know about, and if she isn&rsquo;t known to the Amyrlin,
either, so much the better. I am not sure we can trust the Amyrlin
much further than the Black Ajah. She means to use us for her own
ends. I mean to see she doesn&rsquo;t use us up. Can you understand
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene nodded reluctantly. Just the same, she said,
&ldquo;It will be dangerous, Elayne, as dangerous as anything we faced in
Falme. Maybe more so. You do not have to be part of it, this
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; Elayne said quietly. She paused, then
went on. &ldquo;When Andor goes to war, the First Prince of the Sword
commands the army, but the Queen rides with them, too. Seven
hundred years ago, at the Battle of Cuallin Dhen, the Andormen were
being routed when Queen Modrellein rode, alone and unarmed,
carrying the Lion banner into the midst of the Tairen army. The
Andormen rallied and attacked once more, to save her, and won the
battle. That is the kind of courage expected of the Queen of Andor.
If I have not learned to control my fear yet, I must before I take
my mother&rsquo;s place on the Lion Throne.&rdquo; Suddenly her somber mood
vanished in a giggle. &ldquo;Besides, do you think I would pass up an
adventure so I could scrub pots?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will do that anyway,&rdquo; Nynaeve told her, &ldquo;and
hope that everyone thinks that is all you are doing. Now listen
carefully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne listened, and her mouth slowly dropped open as
Nynaeve unfolded what the Amyrlin Seat had told them, and the task
she had laid on them, and the attempt on their lives. She shivered
over the Gray Man, and read the document the Amyrlin had given
Nynaeve with a look of wonder, then returned it, murmuring, &ldquo;I wish
I could have that when I face Mother next.&rdquo; By the time Nynaeve
finished, though, her face was a picture of indignation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s like being told to go up in the hills
and find lions, only you do not know whether there are any lions,
but if there are, they may be hunting you, and they may be
disguised as bushes. Oh, and if you find any lions, try not to let
them eat you before you can tell where they are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are afraid,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, &ldquo;you can still
stand aside. It will be too late, once you&rsquo;ve begun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne tossed her head back. &ldquo;Of course I am afraid.
I am not a fool. But not afraid enough to quit before I have even
started.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is something else, too,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. &ldquo;I am
afraid the Amyrlin may mean to let Mat die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But an Aes Sedai is supposed to Heal anyone who
asks.&rdquo; The Daughter-Heir seemed caught between indignation and
disbelief. &ldquo;Why would she let Mat die? I cannot believe it! I will
not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor can I!&rdquo; Egwene gasped. <em>She could not have
meant that! The Amyrlin</em> couldn&rsquo;t <em>let him die!</em> &ldquo;All
the way here Verin said that the Amyrlin would see he was
Healed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve shook her head. &ldquo;Verin said the Amyrlin would
&lsquo;see to him.&rsquo; That is not the same thing. And the Amyrlin avoided
saying yes or no when I asked her. Maybe she has not made her mind
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But <em>why</em>?&rdquo; Elayne asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because the White Tower does what it does for its
own reasons.&rdquo; Nynaeve&rsquo;s voice made Egwene shiver. &ldquo;I do not know
why. Whether they help Mat live or let him die depends on what
serves their ends. None of the Three Oaths says they have to Heal
him. Mat is just a tool, in the Amyrlin&rsquo;s eyes. So are we. She will
use us to hunt the Black Ajah, but if you break a tool so it cannot
be fixed, you don&rsquo;t weep over it. You just get another one. Both of
you had best remember that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are we going to do about him?&rdquo; Egwene asked.
&ldquo;What can we do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve went to her wardrobe and rummaged in the back
of it. When she came out, she had a striped cloth bag of herbs.
&ldquo;With my medicines&mdash;and luck&mdash;perhaps I can Heal him
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Verin could not,&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;Moiraine and Verin
together could not, and Moiraine had an <em>angreal</em>. Nynaeve,
if you draw too much of the One Power, you could burn yourself to a
cinder. Or just still yourself, if you are lucky. If you can call
that luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve shrugged. &ldquo;They keep telling me I have the
potential to be the most powerful Aes Sedai in a thousand years.
Perhaps it is time to find out whether they are right.&rdquo; She gave a
tug to her braid.</p>

<p>It was plain that however brave Nynaeve&rsquo;s words, she
was afraid. <em>But she won&rsquo;t let Mat die even if it means risking
death herself</em>. &ldquo;They keep saying we&rsquo;re all three so powerful&mdash;or will be. Maybe, if we all try together, we can divide the
flow among us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have never tried working together,&rdquo; Nynaeve said
slowly. &ldquo;I am not sure I know how to combine our abilities. Trying
could be almost as dangerous as drawing too much of the Power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, if we are going to do it,&rdquo; Elayne said, climbing
off the bed, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s do it. The longer we talk of it, the more
frightened I will become. Mat is in the guest rooms. I do not know
which one, but Sheriam told me that much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As if to put a period to her words, the door banged
open, and an Aes Sedai entered as though it were her room, and they
the interlopers.</p>

<p>Egwene made her curtsy deep, to hide the dismay on
her face.</p>
