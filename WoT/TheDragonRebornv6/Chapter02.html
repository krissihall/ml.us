expressionless, the Tuatha&rsquo;an woman stared at
the banner as it drooped again, then turned her attention to those
around the fire. Especially the one reading, the one half again as
tall as Perrin and twice a big. &ldquo;You have an Ogier with you. I
would not have thought&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She shook her head. &ldquo;Where is
Moiraine Sedai?&rdquo; It seemed the Dragon banner might as well not
exist as far as she was concerned.</p>

<p>Perrin gestured toward the rough but that stood
furthest up the slope, at the far end of the bowl. With walls and
sloping roof of unpeeled logs, it was the largest, though not very
big at that. Perhaps just barely large enough to be called a cabin
rather than a hut. &ldquo;That one is hers. Hers and Lan&rsquo;s. He is her
Warder. When you have had something hot to drink&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I must speak to Moiraine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was not surprised. All the women who came insisted
on speaking to Moiraine immediately, and alone. The news that
Moiraine chose to share with the rest of them did not always seem
very important, but the women held the intensity of a hunter
stalking the last rabbit in the world for his starving family. The
half-frozen old beggar woman had refused blankets and a plate of
hot stew and tramped up to Moiraine&rsquo;s hut, barefoot in
still-falling snow.</p>

<p>Leya slid from her saddle and handed the reins up to
Perrin. &ldquo;Will you see that she is fed?&rdquo; She patted the piebald
mare&rsquo;s nose. &ldquo;Piesa is not used to carrying me over such rugged
country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fodder is scarce, still,&rdquo; Perrin told her, &ldquo;but
she&rsquo;ll have what we can give her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leya nodded, and went hurrying away up the slope
without another word, holding her bright green skirts up, the
blue-embroidered red cloak swaying behind her.</p>

<p>Perrin swung down from his saddle, exchanging a few
words with the men who came from the fires to take the horses. He
gave his bow to the one who took Stepper. No, except for one raven,
they had seen nothing but the mountains and the Tuatha&rsquo;an woman.
Yes, the raven was dead. No, she had told them nothing of what was
happening outside the mountains. No, he had no idea whether they
would be leaving soon.</p>

<p><em>Or ever</em>, he added to himself. Moiraine had
kept them there all winter. The Shienarans did not think she gave
the orders, not here, but Perrin knew that Aes Sedai somehow always
seemed to get their way. Especially Moiraine.</p>

<p>Once the horses were led away to the rude log stable,
the riders went to warm themselves. Perrin tossed his cloak back
over his shoulders and held his hands out to the flames gratefully.
The big kettle, Baerlon work by the look of it, gave off smells
that had been making his mouth water for some time already. Someone
had been lucky hunting today, it seemed, and lumpy roots circled
another fire close by, giving off an aroma faintly like turnips as
they roasted. He wrinkled his nose and concentrated on the stew.
More and more he wanted meat above anything else.</p>

<p>The woman in men&rsquo;s clothes was peering toward Leya,
who was just disappearing into Moiraine&rsquo;s hut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you see, Min?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>She came to stand beside him, her dark eyes troubled.
He did not understand why she insisted on breeches instead of
skirts. Perhaps it was because he knew her, but he could not see
how anyone could look at her and see a too-handsome youth instead
of a pretty young woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Tinker woman is going to die,&rdquo; she said softly,
eyeing the others near the fires. None was close enough to
hear.</p>

<p>He was still, thinking of Leya&rsquo;s gentle face. <em>Ah,
Light! Tinkers never harm anyone!</em> He felt cold despite the
warmth of the fire. <em>Burn me, I wish I&rsquo;d never asked</em>. Even
the few Aes Sedai who knew of it did not understand what Min did.
Sometimes she saw images and auras surrounding people, and
sometimes she even knew what they meant.</p>

<p>Masuto came to stir the stew with a long wood spoon.
The Shienaran eyed them, then laid a finger alongside his long nose
and grinned widely before he left.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blood and ashes!&rdquo; Min muttered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s probably
decided we are sweethearts murmuring to each other by the
fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; Perrin asked. She raised her eyebrows
at him, and he hastily added, &ldquo;About Leya.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that her name? I wish I didn&rsquo;t know. It always
makes it worse, knowing and not being able to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Perrin, I saw
her own face floating over her shoulder, covered in blood, eyes
staring. It&rsquo;s never any clearer than that.&rdquo; She shivered and rubbed
her hands together briskly. &ldquo;Light, but I wish I saw more happy
things. All the happy things seem to have gone away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He opened his mouth to suggest warning Leya, then
closed it again. There was never any doubt about what Min saw and
knew, for good or bad. If she was certain, it happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blood on her face,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Does that mean
she&rsquo;ll die by violence?&rdquo; He winced that he said it so easily. <em>
But what can I do? If I tell Leya, if I make her believe somehow,
she&rsquo;ll live her last days in fear, and it will change
nothing</em>.</p>

<p>Min gave a short nod.</p>

<p><em>If she&rsquo;s going to die by violence, it could mean
an attack on the camp</em>. But there were scouts out every day,
and guards set day and night. And Moiraine had the camp warded, so
she said; no creature of the Dark One would see it unless he walked
right into it. He thought of the wolves. <em>No!</em> The scouts
would find anyone or anything trying to approach the camp. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
long way back to her people,&rdquo; he said half to himself. &ldquo;Tinkers
wouldn&rsquo;t have brought their wagons any further than the foothills.
Anything could happen between here and there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min nodded sadly. &ldquo;And there aren&rsquo;t enough of us to
spare even one guard for her. Even if it would do any good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had told him; she had tried warning people about
bad things when, at six or seven, she had first realized not
everyone could see what she saw. She would not say more, but he had
the impression that her warnings had only made matters worse, when
they were believed at all. It took some doing to believe in Min&rsquo;s
viewings until you had proof.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo; he said. The word was cold in his ears, and
hard as tool steel. <em>I can&rsquo;t do anything ahout Leya, but maybe I
can figure out whether we&rsquo;re going to be attacked</em>.</p>

<p>As soon as the word was out of his mouth, she threw
up her hands. She kept her voice down, though. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t like that.
I can never tell <em>when</em> something is going to happen. I only
know it <em>will</em>, if I even know what I see means. You don&rsquo;t
understand. The seeing doesn&rsquo;t come when I want it to, and neither
does knowing. It just happens, and sometimes I know. Something. A
little bit. It just happens.&rdquo; He tried to get a soothing word in,
but she was letting it all out in a flood he could not stem. &ldquo;I can
see things around a man one day and not the next, or the other way
&rsquo;round. Most of the time, I don&rsquo;t see anything around anyone. Aes
Sedai always have images around them, of course, and Warders,
though it&rsquo;s always harder to say what it means with them than with
anyone else.&rdquo; She gave Perrin a searching look, half squinting. &ldquo;A
few others always do, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me what you see when you look at me,&rdquo; he
said harshly, then shrugged his heavy shoulders. Even as a child he
had been bigger than most of the others, and he had quickly learned
how easy it was to hurt people by accident when you were bigger
than they. It had made him cautious and careful, and regretful of
his anger when he let it show. &ldquo;I am sorry, Min. I shouldn&rsquo;t have
snapped at you. I did not mean to hurt you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave him a surprised look. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t hurt me.
Blessed few people <em>want</em> to know what I see. The Light
knows, I would not, if it were someone else who could do it.&rdquo; Even
the Aes Sedai had never heard of anyone else who had her gift.
&ldquo;Gift&rdquo; was how they saw it, even if she did not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that I wish there were something I could
do about Leya. I couldn&rsquo;t stand it the way you do, knowing and not
able to do anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strange,&rdquo; she said softly, &ldquo;how you seem to care so
much about the Tuatha&rsquo;an. They are utterly peaceful, and I always
see violence around&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned his head away, and she cut off
abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tuatha&rsquo;an?&rdquo; came a rumbling voice, like a huge
bumblebee. &ldquo;What about the Tuatha&rsquo;an?&rdquo; The Ogier came to join them
at the fire, marking his place in his book with a finger the size
of a large sausage. A thin streamer of tabac smoke rose from the
pipe in his other hand. His high-necked coat of dark brown wool
buttoned up to the neck, and flared at the knee over turned-down
boot tops. Perrin stood hardly as high as his chest.</p>

<p>Loial&rsquo;s face had frightened more than one person,
with his nose broad enough almost to be called a snout and his
too-wide mouth. His eyes were the size of saucers, with thick
eyebrows that dangled like mustaches almost to his cheeks, and his
ears poked up through long hair in ruffed points. Some who had
never seen an Ogier took him for a Trolloc, though Trollocs were as
much legend to most of them as Ogier.</p>

<p>Loial&rsquo;s wide smile wavered and his eyes blinked as he
became aware of having interrupted them. Perrin wondered how anyone
could be frightened of the Ogier for long. <em>Yet some of the old
stories call them fierce, and implacable as enemies</em>. He could
not believe it. Ogier were enemies to no one.</p>

<p>Min told Loial of Leya&rsquo;s arrival, but not of what she
had seen. She was usually closemouthed about those seeings,
especially when they were bad. Instead, she added, &ldquo;You should know
how I feel, Loial, suddenly caught up by Aes Sedai and these Two
Rivers folk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial made a noncommittal sound, but Min seemed to
take it for agreement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said emphatically. &ldquo;There I was, living my
life in Baerlon as I liked it, when suddenly I was grabbed up by
the scruff of the neck and jerked off to the Light knows where.
Well, I might as well have been. My life has not been my own since
I met Moiraine. And these Two Rivers farmboys.&rdquo; She rolled her eyes
at Perrin, a wry twist to her mouth. &ldquo;All I wanted was to live as I
pleased, fall in love with a man I chose&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Her cheeks reddened
suddenly, and she cleared her throat. &ldquo;I mean to say, what is wrong
with wanting to live your life without all this upheaval?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Ta&rsquo;veren</em>,&rdquo; Loial began. Perrin waved at him
to stop, but the Ogier could seldom be slowed, much less stopped,
when one of his enthusiasms had him in its grip. He was accounted
extremely hasty, by the Ogier way of looking at things. Loial
pushed his book into a coat pocket and went on, gesturing with his
pipe. &ldquo;All of us, all of our lives, affect the lives of others,
Min. As the Wheel of Time weaves us into the Pattern, the
life-thread of each of us pulls and tugs at the life-threads around
us. <em>Ta&rsquo;veren</em> are the same, only much, much more so. They
tug at the entire Pattern&mdash;for a time, at least&mdash;forcing it to shape around them. The closer you are to them, the
more you are affected personally. It&rsquo;s said that if you were in the
same room with Artur Hawkwing, you could feel the Pattern
rearranging itself. I don&rsquo;t know how true that is, but I&rsquo;ve read
that it was. But it doesn&rsquo;t only work one way. <em>Ta&rsquo;veren</em>
themselves are woven to a tighter line than the rest of us, with
fewer choices.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin grimaced. <em>Bloody few of the ones that
matter</em>.</p>

<p>Min tossed, her head. &ldquo;I just wish they didn&rsquo;t have
to be so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;so bloody <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> all the time. <em>
Ta&rsquo;veren</em> tugging on one side, and Aes Sedai meddling on the
other. What chance does a woman have?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial shrugged. &ldquo;Very little, I suppose, as long as
she stays close to <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As if I had a choice,&rdquo; Min growled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was your good fortune&mdash;or misfortune, if
you see it that way&mdash;to fall in with not one, but three <em>
ta&rsquo;veren</em>. Rand, Mat, and Perrin. I myself count it very good
fortune, and would even if they weren&rsquo;t my friends. I think I might
even&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; The Ogier looked at them, suddenly shy, his ears
twitching. &ldquo;Promise you will not laugh? I think I might write a
book about it. I have been taking notes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min smiled, a friendly smile, and Loial&rsquo;s ears
pricked back up again. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s wonderful,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;But some
of us feel as if we&rsquo;re being danced about like puppets by these
<em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask for it,&rdquo; Perrin burst out. &ldquo;I did not
ask for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She ignored him. &ldquo;Is that what happened to you,
Loial? Is that why you travel with Moiraine? I know you Ogier
almost never leave your <em>stedding</em>. Did one of these <em>
ta&rsquo;veren</em> tug you along with him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial became engrossed in a study of his pipe. &ldquo;I
just wanted to see the groves the Ogier planted,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;Just to see the groves.&rdquo; He glanced at Perrin as if asking for
help, but Perrin only grinned.</p>

<p><em>Let&rsquo;s see how the shoe nails onto your hoof</em>.
He did not know all of it, but he did know Loial had run away. He
was ninety years old, but not yet old enough by Ogier standards to
leave the <em>stedding</em>&mdash;going Outside, they called it&mdash;without the permission of the Elders. Ogier lived a very
long time, as humans saw things. Loial said the Elders would not be
best pleased when they put their hands on him again. He seemed
intent on putting that moment off as long as possible.</p>

<p>There was a stir among the Shienarans, men getting to
their feet. Rand was coming out of Moiraine&rsquo;s hut.</p>

<p>Even at that distance Perrin could make him out
clearly, a young man with reddish hair and gray eyes. He was of an
age with Perrin, and would stand half a head taller if they were
side by side, though Rand was more slender, if still broad across
the shoulders. Embroidered golden thorns ran up the sleeves of his
high-collared red coat, and on the breast of his dark cloak stood
the same creature as on the banner, the four-legged serpent with
the golden mane. Rand and he had grown up together as friends. <em>
Are we still friends? Can we be? Now?</em></p>

<p>The Shienarans bowed as one, heads held up but hands
to knees. &ldquo;Lord Dragon,&rdquo; Uno called, &ldquo;we stand ready. Honor to
serve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uno, who could hardly say a sentence without a curse,
spoke now with the deepest respect. The others echoed him. &ldquo;Honor
to serve.&rdquo; Masema, who saw ill in everything, and whose eyes now
shone with utter devotion; Ragan; all of them, awaiting a command
if it were Rand&rsquo;s pleasure to give one.</p>

<p>From the slope Rand stared down at them a moment,
then turned and disappeared into the trees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has been arguing with Moiraine again,&rdquo; Min said
quietly. &ldquo;All day, this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin was not surprised, yet he still felt a small
shock. Arguing with an Aes Sedai. All the childhood tales came back
to him. Aes Sedai, who made thrones and nations dance to their
hidden strings. Aes Sedai, whose gift always had a hook in it,
whose price was always smaller than you could believe, yet always
turned out to be greater than you could imagine. Aes Sedai, whose
anger could break the ground and summon lightning. Some of the
stories were untrue, he knew now. And at the same time, they did
not tell the half.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had better go to him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;After they argue,
he always needs someone to talk to.&rdquo; And aside from Moiraine and
Lan, there were only the three of them&mdash;Min, Loial, and him&mdash;who did not stare at Rand as if he stood above kings. And of
the three only Perrin knew him from before.</p>

<p>He strode up the slope, pausing only to glance at the
closed door of Moiraine&rsquo;s hut. Leya would be in there, and Lan. The
Warder seldom let himself get far from the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s much smaller hut was a little lower down, well
hidden in the trees, away from all the rest. He had tried living
down among the other men, but their constant awe drove him off. He
kept to himself, now. Too much to himself, to Perrin&rsquo;s thinking.
But he knew Rand was not headed to his hut now.</p>

<p>Perrin hurried on to where one side of the
bowl-shaped valley suddenly became sheer cliff, fifty paces high
and smooth except for tough brush clinging tenaciously here and
there. He knew exactly where a crack in the gray rock wall lay, an
opening hardly wider than his shoulders. With only a ribbon of
late-afternoon light overhead, it was like walking down a
tunnel.</p>

<p>Half a mile the crack ran, abruptly opening out into
a narrow vale, less than a mile long, its floor covered with rocks
and boulders, and even the steep slopes were thickly forested with
tall leatherleaf and pine and fir. Long shadows stretched away from
the sun sitting on the mountaintops. The walls of this place were
unbroken save for the crack, and as steep as if a giant axe had
buried itself in the mountains. It could be even more easily
defended by a few than the bowl, but it had neither stream nor
spring. No one went there. Except Rand, after he argued with
Moiraine.</p>

<p>Rand stood not far from the entrance, leaning against
the rough trunk of a leatherleaf, staring at the palms of his
hands. Perrin knew that on each there was a heron, branded into the
flesh. Rand did not move when Perrin&rsquo;s boot scraped on stone.</p>

<p>Suddenly Rand began to recite softly, never looking
up from his hands.</p>

<p class="verse_quote">&ldquo;Twice and twice shall he be marked,<br>
twice to live, and twice to die.<br>
Once the heron, to set his path.<br>
Twice the heron, to name him true.<br>
Once the Dragon, for remembrance lost.<br>
Twice the Dragon, for the price he must pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a shudder he tucked his hands under his arms.
&ldquo;But no Dragons, yet.&rdquo; He chuckled roughly. &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Perrin simply looked at him. A man who
could channel the One Power. A man doomed to go mad from the taint
on <em>saidin</em>, the male half of the True Source, and certain
to destroy everything around him in his madness. A man&mdash;a
thing!&mdash;everyone was taught to loathe and fear from
childhood. Only&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;it was hard to stop seeing the boy he had
grown up with. <em>How do you just</em> stop <em>being somebody&rsquo;s
friend?</em> Perrin chose a small boulder with a flat top, and sat,
waiting.</p>

<p>After a while Rand turned his head to look at him.
&ldquo;Do you think Mat is all right? He looked so sick, the last I saw
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must be all right by now.&rdquo; <em>He should be in
Tar Valon, by now. They&rsquo;ll Heal him, there. And Nynaeve and Egwene
will keep him out of trouble</em>. Egwene and Nynaeve, Rand and Mat
and Perrin. All five from Emond&rsquo;s Field in the Two Rivers. Few
people had come into the Two Rivers from outside, except for
occasional peddlers, and merchants once a year to buy wool and
tabac. Almost no one had ever left. Until the Wheel chose out its
<em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, and five simple country folk could stay where
they were no longer. Could be what they had been no longer.</p>

<p>Rand nodded and was silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lately,&rdquo; Perrin said, &ldquo;I find myself wishing I was
still a blacksmith. Do you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Do you wish you were still just a
shepherd?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Duty,&rdquo; Rand muttered. &ldquo;Death is lighter than a
feather, duty heavier than a mountain. That&rsquo;s what they say in
Shienar. &lsquo;The Dark One is stirring. The Last Battle is coming. And
the Dragon Reborn has to face the Dark One in the Last Battle, or
the Shadow will cover everything. The Wheel of Time broken. Every
Age remade in the Dark One&rsquo;s image.&rsquo; There&rsquo;s only me.&rdquo; He began to
laugh mirthlessly, his shoulders shaking. &ldquo;I have the duty, because
there isn&rsquo;t anybody else, now is there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin shifted uneasily. The laughter had a raw edge
that made his skin crawl. &ldquo;I understand you were arguing with
Moiraine again. The same thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand drew a deep, ragged breath. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t we always
argue about the same thing? They&rsquo;re down there, on Almoth Plain,
and the Light alone knows where else. Hundreds of them. Thousands.
They declared for the Dragon Reborn because I raised that banner.
Because I let myself be called the Dragon. Because I could see no
other choice. And they&rsquo;re dying. Fighting, searching, and praying
for the man who is supposed to lead them. Dying. And I sit here
safe in the mountains all winter. I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I owe them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think I like it?&rdquo; Perrin swung his head in
irritation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You take whatever she says to you,&rdquo; Rand grated.
&ldquo;You never stand up to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much good it has done you, standing up to her. You
have argued all winter, and we have sat here like lumps all
winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because she is right.&rdquo; Rand laughed again, that
chilling laugh. &ldquo;The Light burn me, she is right. They are all
split up into little groups all over the plain, all across Tarabon
and Arad Doman. If I join any one of them, the Whitecloaks and the
Domani army and the Taraboners will be on top of them like a duck
on a beetle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin almost laughed himself, in confusion. &ldquo;If you
agree with her, why in the Light do you argue all the time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I have to do something. Or I&rsquo;ll&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;burst like a rotted melon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do what? If you listen to what she says&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand gave him no chance to say they would sit there
forever. &ldquo;Moiraine says! Moiraine says!&rdquo; Rand jerked erect,
squeezing his head between his hands. &ldquo;Moiraine has something to
say about everything! Moiraine says I mustn&rsquo;t go to the men who are
dying in my name. Moiraine says I&rsquo;ll know what to do next because
the Pattern will force me to it. Moiraine says! But she never says
how I&rsquo;ll know. Oh, no! She doesn&rsquo;t know that.&rdquo; His hands fell to
his sides, and he turned toward Perrin, head tilted and eyes
narrowed. &ldquo;Sometimes I feel as if Moiraine is putting me through my
paces like a fancy Tairen stallion doing his steps. Do you ever
feel that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin scrubbed a hand through his shaggy hair. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Whatever is pushing us, or pulling us, I know who the enemy is,
Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ba&rsquo;alzamon,&rdquo; Rand said softly. An ancient name for
the Dark One. In the Trolloc tongue, it meant Heart of the Dark.
&ldquo;And I must face him, Perrin.&rdquo; His eyes closed in a grimace, half
smile, half pain. &ldquo;Light help me, half the time I want it to happen
now, to be over and done with, and the other half&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;How many
times can I manage to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Light, it pulls at me so. What if I
can&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;What if I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; The ground trembled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand?&rdquo; Perrin said worriedly.</p>

<p>Rand shivered; despite the chill, there was sweat on
his face. His eyes were still shut tight. &ldquo;Oh, Light,&rdquo; he groaned,
&ldquo;it pulls so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly the ground heaved beneath Perrin, and the
valley echoed with a vast rumble. It seemed as if the ground was
jerked out from under his feet. He fell&mdash;or the earth leaped
up to meet him. The valley shook as though a vast hand had reached
down from the sky to wrench it out of the land. He clung to the
ground while it tried to bounce him like a ball. Pebbles in front
of his eyes leaped and tumbled, and dust rose in waves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand!&rdquo; His bellow was lost in the grumbling
roar.</p>

<p>Rand stood with his head thrown back, his eyes still
shut tight. He did not seem to feel the thrashing of the ground
that had him now at one angle, now at another. His balance never
shifted, no matter how he was tossed. Perrin could not be certain,
being shaken as he was, but he thought Rand wore a sad smile. The
trees flailed about, and the leatherleaf suddenly cracked in two,
the greater part of its trunk crashing down not three paces from
Rand. He noticed it no more than he noticed any of the rest.</p>

<p>Perrin struggled to fill his lungs. &ldquo;Rand! For the
love of the Light, Rand! Stop it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As abruptly as it had begun, it was done. A weakened
branch cracked off of a stunted oak with a loud snap. Perrin got to
his feet slowly, coughing. Dust hung in the air, sparkling motes in
the rays of the setting sun.</p>

<p>Rand was staring at nothing, now, chest heaving as if
he had run ten miles. This had never happened before, nor anything
remotely like it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand,&rdquo; Perrin said carefully, &ldquo;what&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand still seemed to be looking into a far distance.
&ldquo;It is always there. Calling to me. Pulling at me. <em>Saidin</em>.
The male half of the True Source. Sometimes I can&rsquo;t stop myself
from reaching out for it.&rdquo; He made a motion of plucking something
out of the air, and transferred his stare to his closed fist. &ldquo;I
can feel the taint even before I touch it. The Dark One&rsquo;s taint,
like a thin coat of vileness trying to hide the Light. It turns my
stomach, but I cannot help myself. I cannot! Only sometimes, I
reach out, and it&rsquo;s like trying to catch air.&rdquo; His empty hand
sprang open, and he gave a bitter laugh. &ldquo;What if that happens when
the Last Battle comes? What if I reach out and catch nothing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you caught something that time,&rdquo; Perrin said
hoarsely. &ldquo;What were you doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand looked around as if seeing things for the first
time. The fallen leatherleaf, and the broken branches. There was,
Perrin realized, surprisingly little damage. He had expected gaping
rents in the earth. The wall of trees looked almost whole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not mean to do this. It was as if I tried to
open a tap, and instead pulled the whole tap out of the barrel. It&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;filled me. I had to send it somewhere before it burned me up,
but I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I did not mean this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin shook his head. <em>What use to tell him to
try not to do it again? He barely knows more about what he&rsquo;s doing
than I do</em>. He contented himself with, &ldquo;There are enough who
want you dead&mdash;and the rest of us&mdash;without you doing
the job for them.&rdquo; Rand did not seem to be listening. &ldquo;We had best
get on back to the camp. It will be dark soon, and I don&rsquo;t know
about you, but I am hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? Oh. You go on, Perrin. I will be along. I want
to be alone again a while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin hesitated, then turned reluctantly toward the
crack in the valley wall. He stopped when Rand spoke again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you have dreams when you sleep? Good dreams?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; Perrin said warily. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember
much of what I dream.&rdquo; He had learned to set guards on his
dreaming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re always there, dreams,&rdquo; Rand said, so softly
Perrin barely heard. &ldquo;Maybe they tell us things. True things.&rdquo; He
fell silent, brooding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Supper&rsquo;s waiting,&rdquo; Perrin said, but Rand was deep in
his own thoughts. Finally Perrin turned and left him standing
there.</p>
