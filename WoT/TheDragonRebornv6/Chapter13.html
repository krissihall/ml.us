<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">L</span>ying
on her narrow bed, Egwene frowned up at the
flickering shadows cast on the ceiling by her single lamp. She
wished she could form some plan of action, or reason out what to
expect next. Nothing came. The shadows had more pattern than her
thoughts. She could hardly even make herself worry about Mat, yet
the shame she felt at that was small, crushed by the walls around
her.</p>

<p>It was a stark, windowless room, like all those in
the novices&rsquo; quarters, small and square and painted white, with
pegs on one wall for hanging her belongings, the bed built against
a second, and a tiny shelf on a third, where in other days she had
kept a few books borrowed from the Tower library. A washstand and a
three-legged stool completed the furnishings. The floorboards were
almost white from scrubbing. She had done that task, on hands and
knees, every day she had lived there, in addition to her other
chores and lessons. Novices lived simply, whether they were
innkeepers&rsquo; daughters or the Daughter-Heir of Andor.</p>

<p>She wore the plain white dress of a novice again&mdash;even her belt and pouch were white&mdash;but she felt no
joy at having rid herself of the hated gray. Her room had become
too much of a prison cell. <em>What if they mean to keep me here.
In this room. Like a cell. Like a collar and</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She glanced at the door&mdash;the dark Accepted
would still be standing guard on the other side, she knew&mdash;and rolled close to the white plastered wall. Just above the
mattress was a small hole, almost invisible unless you knew where
to look, drilled through into the next room by novices long ago.
Egwene kept her voice to a whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elayne?&rdquo; There was no answer. &ldquo;Elayne? Are you
asleep?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could I sleep?&rdquo; came Elayne&rsquo;s reply, a reedy
whisper through the hole. &ldquo;I thought we might be in some trouble,
but I did not expect this. Egwene, what are they going to do to
us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene had no answer, and her guesses were not of the
sort she wanted to voice aloud. She did not even want to think of
them. &ldquo;I actually thought we might be heroes, Elayne. We brought
back the Horn of Valere safely. We discovered Liandrin is Black
Ajah.&rdquo; Her voice skipped on that. Aes Sedai had always denied the
existence of a Black Ajah, an Ajah that served the Dark One, and
were known to become angry with anyone who even suggested it was
real. <em>But we know it&rsquo;s real</em>. &ldquo;We should be heroes,
Elayne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;Should and would build no bridges,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; Elayne said.
&ldquo;Light, I used to hate it when Mother said that to me, but it&rsquo;s
true. Verin said we mustn&rsquo;t speak of the Horn, or Liandrin, to
anyone but her or the Amyrlin Seat. I do not think any of this will
work out the way we thought. It is not fair. We&rsquo;ve been through so
much; you&rsquo;ve been through so much. It just is not fair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Verin says. Moiraine says. I know why people think
Aes Sedai are puppetmasters. I can almost feel the strings on my
arms and legs. Whatever they do, it will be what they decide is
good for the White Tower, not what is good or fair for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you still want to be Aes Sedai. Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene hesitated, but there was never any real
question as to her answer. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I still do. It is the
only way we will ever be safe. But I will tell you this. I&rsquo;ll not
let myself be stilled.&rdquo; That was a new thought, voiced as soon as
it came to her, but she realized she did not want to take it back.
<em>Give up touching the True Source?</em> She could sense it
there, even now, the glow just over her shoulder, the shining just
out of sight. She resisted the desire to reach out to it. <em>Give
up being filled with the One Power, feeling more alive than I ever
have before? I won&rsquo;t!</em> &ldquo;Not without a fight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a long silence from the other side of the
wall. &ldquo;How could you stop it? You may be as strong as any of them,
now, but neither one of us knows enough yet to stop even one Aes
Sedai from shielding us from the Source, and there are dozens of
them here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene considered. Finally she said, &ldquo;I could run
away. Really run away, this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They would come after us, Egwene. I&rsquo;m sure they
would. Once you show any ability at all, they don&rsquo;t let you go
until you&rsquo;ve learned enough not to kill yourself. Or just die from
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not a simple village girl anymore. I have seen
something of the world. I can keep out of Aes Sedai hands if I want
to.&rdquo; She was trying to convince herself as much as Elayne. <em>And
what if I don&rsquo;t know enough, yet? Enough about the world, enough
about the Power? What if just channeling can still kill me?</em>
She refused to think of that. <em>So much I have to learn yet. I
won&rsquo;t let them stop me</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mother might protect us,&rdquo; Elayne said, &ldquo;if what
that Whitecloak said is true. I never thought I would hope
something like that was the truth. But if it isn&rsquo;t, Mother is just
as likely to send us both back in chains. Will you teach me how to
live in a village?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene blinked at the wall. &ldquo;You will come with me?
If it comes to that, I mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was another long silence, then a faint whisper.
&ldquo;I do not want to be stilled, Egwene. I will not be. I will not
be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door swung open, crashing against the wall, and
Egwene sat up with a start. She heard the bang of a door from the
other side of the wall. Faolain stepped into Egwene&rsquo;s room, smiling
as her eyes went to the tiny hole. Similar holes joined most of the
novice rooms; any woman who had been a novice knew of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whispering with your friend, eh?&rdquo; the curly-haired
Accepted said with surprising warmth. &ldquo;Well, it grows lonely,
waiting by yourself. Did you have a nice chat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene opened her mouth, then closed it again
hastily. She could answer Aes Sedai, Sheriam had said. No one else.
She regarded the Accepted with a level expression and waited.</p>

<p>The false sympathy slid off Faolain&rsquo;s face like water
running off a roof. &ldquo;On your feet. The Amyrlin&rsquo;s not to be kept
waiting by the likes of you. You are lucky I did not come in in
time to hear you. Move!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Novices were supposed to obey the Accepted almost as
quickly as they obeyed Aes Sedai, but Egwene got to her feet
slowly, and took as much time as she dared in smoothing her dress.
She gave Faolain a small curtsy and a tiny smile. The scowl that
rolled across the Accepted&rsquo;s face made Egwene&rsquo;s smile grow before
she remembered to rein it in; there was no point in pushing Faolain
too far. Holding herself straight, pretending her knees were not
shaking, she preceded the Accepted out of the room.</p>

<p>Elayne was already waiting outside with the
apple-cheeked Accepted, looking fiercely determined to be brave.
Somehow, she managed to give the impression that the Accepted was a
handmaid carrying her gloves. Egwene hoped that she herself was
doing half so well.</p>

<p>The railed galleries of the novices&rsquo; quarters rose
tier on tier above, in a hollow column, and fell as many below, to
the Novices&rsquo; Court. There were no other women in sight. Even if
every novice in the Tower had been there, though, less than a
quarter of the rooms would have been filled. The four of them
walked &rsquo;round the empty galleries and down the spiraling ramps in
silence; none could bear to have the sounds of voices emphasize the
emptiness.</p>

<p>Egwene had never before been into the part of the
Tower where the Amyrlin had her rooms. The corridors there were
wide enough for a wagon to pass down easily, and taller than they
were wide. Colorful tapestries hung on the walls, tapestries in a
dozen styles, of floral designs and forest scenes, of heroic deeds
and intricate patterns, some so old they looked as if they might
break if handled. Their shoes made loud clicks on
diamond-shaped floor tiles that repeated the colors of the
seven Ajahs.</p>

<p>There were few other women in evidence&mdash;an Aes
Sedai now and then, sweeping majestically along with no time to
notice Accepted or novices; five or six Accepted hurrying
self-importantly about their tasks or studies; a sprinkling of
serving women with trays, or mops, or armfuls of sheets or towels;
a few novices moving on errands even more quickly than the
servants.</p>

<p>Nynaeve and her slim-necked escort, Theodrin, joined
them. Neither spoke. Nynaeve wore an Accepted&rsquo;s dress, now, white
with the seven colored bands at the hem, but her belt and pouch
were her own. She gave Egwene and Elayne each a reassuring smile
and a hug&mdash;Egwene was so relieved to see another friendly
face that she returned the hug with barely a thought that Nynaeve
was behaving as if she were comforting children&mdash;but as they
walked on, Nynaeve gave her thick braid a sharp tug from time to
time, too.</p>

<p>Very few men came into that part of the Tower, and
Egwene saw only two: Warders walking side by side in conversation,
one with his sword on his hip, the other with his on his back. One
was short and slender, even slight, the other almost as wide as he
was tall, yet both moved with a dangerous grace. The color-shifting
Warder cloaks made them queasy-making to watch for long, parts of
them sometimes seeming to fade into the walls bond. She saw Nynaeve
looking at them, and shook her head. <em>She has to do something
about Lan. If any of us can do anything about anyone after
today</em>.</p>

<p>The antechamber of the Amyrlin Seat&rsquo;s study was grand
enough for any palace, though the chairs scattered about for those
who might wait were plain, but Egwene had eyes only for Leane
Sedai. The Keeper wore her narrow stole of office, blue to show she
had been raised from the Blue Ajah, and her face could have been
carved from smooth, brownish stone. There was no one else
there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did they give any trouble?&rdquo; The Keeper&rsquo;s clipped way
of talking gave no hint now of either anger or sympathy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Theodrin and the apple-cheeked
Accepted said together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This one had to be pulled by the scruff of her neck,
Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Faolain said, indicating Egwene. The Accepted sounded
indignant. &ldquo;She balks as if she has forgotten what the discipline
of the White Tower is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To lead,&rdquo; Leane said, &ldquo;is neither to push nor to
pull. Go to Marris Sedai, Faolain, and ask her to allow you to
contemplate on this while raking the paths in the Spring Garden.&rdquo;
She dismissed Faolain and the other two Accepted, and they dropped
deep curtsies. From the depth of hers, Faolain shot a furious look
at Egwene.</p>

<p>The Keeper paid no attention to the Accepted&rsquo;s
leaving. Instead, she studied the remaining women, tapping a
forefinger against her lips, till Egwene had the feeling they had
all been measured to the inch and weighed to the ounce. Nynaeve&rsquo;s
eyes took on a dangerous sparkle, and she had a tight grip on her
braid.</p>

<p>Finally Leane raised a hand toward the doors to the
Amyrlin&rsquo;s study. The Great Serpent bit its own tail, a pace across,
on the dark wood of each. &ldquo;Enter,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Nynaeve stepped forward promptly and opened one of
the doors. That was enough to get Egwene moving. Elayne held her
hand tightly, and she gripped Elayne&rsquo;s just as hard. Leane followed
them in and took a place to one side, halfway between the three of
them and the table in the center of the room.</p>

<p>The Amyrlin Seat sat behind the table, examining
papers. She did not look up. Once Nynaeve opened her mouth, but
closed it again, at a sharp look from the Keeper. The three of them
stood in a line in front of the Amyrlin&rsquo;s table and waited. Egwene
tried not to fidget. Long minutes went by&mdash;it seemed like
hours&mdash;before the Amyrlin raised her head, but when those
blue eyes fixed them each in turn, Egwene decided she could have
waited longer. The Amyrlin&rsquo;s gaze was like two icicles boring into
her heart. The room was cool, but a trickle of sweat began to run
down her back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; the Amyrlin said finally. &ldquo;Our runaways
return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We did not run away, Mother.&rdquo; Nynaeve was obviously
straining for calm, but her voice shook with emotion. Anger, Egwene
knew. That strong will was all too often accompanied by anger.
&ldquo;Liandrin told us we were to go with her, and&mdash;&rdquo; The loud
crack of the Amyrlin&rsquo;s hand slapping the table cut her off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not invoke Liandrin&rsquo;s name here, child!&rdquo; the
Amyrlin snapped. Leane watched them with a stern serenity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, Liandrin is Black Ajah,&rdquo; Elayne burst
out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is known, child. Suspected, at least, and as
good as known. Liandrin left the Tower some months ago, and twelve
other&mdash;<em>women</em>&mdash;went with her. None has been
seen since. Before they left, they tried to break into the
storeroom where the <em>angreal</em> and <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em> are
kept, and did manage to enter that where the smaller <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em> are stored. They stole a number of those,
including several we do not know the use of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve stared at the Amyrlin in horror, and Elayne
suddenly rubbed her arms as if she were cold. Egwene knew she was
shivering, too. Many times she had imagined returning to confront
Liandrin and accuse her, to see her condemned to some punishment&mdash;except that she had never managed to imagine any punishment
strong enough to suit that doll-faced Aes Sedai&rsquo;s crimes. She
had even pictured returning to find Liandrin already fled&mdash;in
terror of her return, it was usually. But she had never imagined
anything like this. If Liandrin and the others&mdash;she had not
really wanted to believe there were others&mdash;had stolen those
remnants of the Age of Legends, there was no telling what they
could do with them. <em>Thank the Light they did not get any</em>
<em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>, she thought. The other was bad enough.</p>

<p><em>Sa&rsquo;angreal</em> were like <em>angreal</em>,
allowing an Aes Sedai to channel more of the Power than she safely
could unaided, but far more powerful than <em>angreal</em>, and
rare. <em>Ter&rsquo;angreal</em> were something different. Existing in
greater numbers than either <em>angreal</em> or <em>
sa&rsquo;angreal</em>, though still not common, they used the One Power
rather than helping to channel it, and no one truly understood
them. Many would work only for someone who could channel, needing
the actual channeling of the Power, while others did what they did
for anyone. Where all the <em>angreal</em> and <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>
Egwene had ever heard of were small, <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> could
seemingly be any size. Each had apparently been made for a specific
purpose by those Aes Sedai of three thousand years ago, to do a
certain thing, and Aes Sedai since had died trying to learn what;
died, or had the ability to channel burned out of them. There were
sisters of the Brown Ajah who had made <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> their
life&rsquo;s study.</p>

<p>Some were in use, if likely not for the purposes they
had been made. The stout white rod that the Accepted held while
taking the Three Oaths on being raised to Aes Sedai was a <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, binding them to the oaths as surely as if they
had been bred in the bone. Another <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> was the
site of the final test before a novice was raised to the Accepted.
There were others, including many no one could make work at all,
and many others that seemed to have no practical use.</p>

<p><em>Why did they take things no one knows how to
use?</em> Egwene wondered. <em>Or maybe the Black Ajah</em> does
<em>know</em>. That possibility made her stomach churn. <em>That
might be as bad as</em> sa&rsquo;angreal <em>in Darkfriend
hands</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Theft,&rdquo; the Amyrlin went on in tones as cold as her
eyes, &ldquo;was the least of what they did. Three sisters died that
night, as well as two Warders, seven guards, and nine of the
servants. Murder, done to hide their thieving and their flight. It
may not be proof they were&mdash;<em>Black Ajah</em>&rdquo;&mdash;the
words grated from her mouth&mdash;&ldquo;but few believe otherwise. Nor
do I, in truth. When there are fish heads and blood in the water,
you don&rsquo;t need to see the silverpike to know they are there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why are we being treated as criminals?&rdquo; Nynaeve
demanded. &ldquo;We were tricked by a woman of the&mdash;of the Black
Ajah. That should be enough to clear us of any wrongdoing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin barked a mirthless laugh. &ldquo;You think so,
do you, child? It may be your salvation that no one in the Tower
but Verin, Leane, and I even suspects you had anything to do with
Liandrin. If that were known, much less the little demonstration
you put on for the Whitecloaks&mdash;no need to look so surprised;
Verin told me everything&mdash;if it were known you had gone off
with Liandrin, the Hall might very well vote for stilling the three
of you before you could take a breath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is not fair!&rdquo; Nynaeve said. Leane stirred, but
Nynaeve went on. &ldquo;It is not right! It&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin stood up. That was all, but it cut
Nynaeve short.</p>

<p>Egwene thought she was wise to keep quiet. She had
always believed Nynaeve was as strong, as strong-willed, as anyone
could be. Until she met the woman wearing the striped stole. <em>
Please keep your temper, Nynaeve. We might as well be children</em>&mdash;<em>babes facing our mother, and this Mother can do far
worse than beat us</em>.</p>

<p>It seemed to her a way out was being offered in what
the Amyrlin had said, but she was not sure what way. &ldquo;Mother,
forgive me for speaking, but what do you intend to do to us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do to you, child? I intend to punish you and Elayne
for leaving the Tower without permission, and Nynaeve for leaving
the city without permission. First, you will each be called to
Sheriam Sedai&rsquo;s study, where I&rsquo;ve told her to switch you till you
wish you had a cushion to sit on for the next week. I have already
had this announced to the novices and the Accepted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene blinked in surprise. Elayne gave an audible
grunt, stiffened her back, and muttered something under her breath.
Nynaeve was the only one who seemed to take it without shock.
Punishment, whether extra labors or something else, was always
between the Mistress of Novices and whoever was called to her.
Those were usually novices, but included the Accepted who stepped
far enough beyond the bounds. <em>Sheriam</em> always <em>keeps it
between you and her</em>, Egwene thought bleakly. <em>She can&rsquo;t
have told everyone. But better than being imprisoned. Better than
being stilled</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The announcement is part of the punishment, of
course,&rdquo; the Amyrlin went on, as if she had read Egwene&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;I
have also had it announced that you are all three assigned to the
kitchens, to work with the scullions, until further notice. And I
have let it be whispered about that &lsquo;further notice&rsquo; might just
mean the rest of your natural lives. Do I hear objections to any of
this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Mother,&rdquo; Egwene said quickly. Nynaeve would hate
scrubbing pots even more than the other. <em>It could be worse,
Nynaeve. Light, it could be so much worse</em>. Nynaeve&rsquo;s nostrils
had flared, but she gave her head a tight shake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, Elayne?&rdquo; the Amyrlin said. &ldquo;The
Daughter-Heir of Andor is used to gentler treatment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to be Aes Sedai, Mother,&rdquo; Elayne said in a
firm voice.</p>

<p>The Amyrlin fingered a paper in front of her on the
table and seemed to study it for a moment. When she raised her
head, her smile was not at all pleasant. &ldquo;If any of you had been
silly enough to answer otherwise, I had something to add to your
tally that would have had you cursing your mother for ever letting
your father steal that first kiss. Letting yourselves be winkled
out of the Tower like thoughtless children. Even an infant would
never have fallen into that trap. I will teach you to think before
you act, or else I&rsquo;ll use you to chink cracks in the water
gates!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene found herself offering silent thanks. A
prickle ran over her skin as the Amyrlin continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, as to what else I intend to do with you. It
seems you have all increased your ability to channel remarkably
since you left the Tower. You have learned much. Including some
things,&rdquo; she added sharply, &ldquo;that I intend to see you unlearn!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve surprised Egwene by saying, &ldquo;I know we have
done&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;things&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;we should not have, Mother. I assure you,
we will do our best to live as if we had taken the Three
Oaths.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin grunted. &ldquo;See that you do,&rdquo; she said
dryly. &ldquo;If I could, I&rsquo;d put the Oath Rod in your hands tonight, but
as that is reserved for being raised to Aes Sedai, I must trust to
your good sense&mdash;if you have any&mdash;to keep you whole. As
it is, you, Egwene, and you, Elayne, are to be raised to the
Accepted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne gasped, and Egwene stammered a shocked, &ldquo;Thank
you, Mother.&rdquo; Leane shifted where she stood. Egwene did not think
the Keeper looked best pleased. Not surprised&mdash;she had
obviously known it was coming&mdash;but not pleased, either.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not thank me. Your abilities have gone too far
for you to remain novices. Some will think you should not have the
ring, not after what you&rsquo;ve done, but the sight of you up to your
elbows in greasy pots should mute the criticism. And lest you start
thinking it&rsquo;s some sort of reward, remember that the first few
weeks as one of the Accepted are used to pick the rotting fish out
of the basket of good ones. Your worst day as a novice will seem a
fond dream compared to the least of your studies over the next
weeks. I suspect that some of the sisters who teach you will make
your trials even worse than they strictly must be, but I don&rsquo;t
believe you will complain. Will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>I can learn</em>, Egwene thought. <em>Choose my
own studies. I can learn about the dreams, learn now to</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin&rsquo;s smile cut off her train of thought.
That smile said nothing the sisters could do to them would be worse
than it needed to be, if it left them alive. Nynaeve&rsquo;s face was a
mixture of deep sympathy and horrified remembrance of her own first
weeks as one of the Accepted. The combination was enough to make
Egwene swallow hard. &ldquo;No, Mother,&rdquo; she said faintly. Elayne&rsquo;s reply
was a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s done. Your mother was not at all pleased
by your disappearance, Elayne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She knows?&rdquo; Elayne squeaked.</p>

<p>Leane sniffed, and the Amyrlin arched an eyebrow,
saying, &ldquo;I could hardly keep it from her. You missed her by less
than a month, which may be as well for you. You might not have
survived that meeting. She was mad enough to chew through an oar,
at you, at me, at the White Tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can imagine, Mother,&rdquo; Elayne said faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you can, child. You may have ended a
tradition that began before there <em>was</em> an Andor. A custom
stronger than most laws. Morgase refused to take Elaida back with
her. For the first time ever, the Queen of Andor does not have an
Aes Sedai advisor. She demanded your immediate return to Caemlyn as
soon as you were found. I convinced her it would be safer for you
to train here a little longer. She was ready to remove your two
brothers from their training with the Warders, too. They talked
their way out of that themselves. I still do not know how.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne seemed to be looking inward, perhaps seeing
Morgase in all her anger. She shivered. &ldquo;Gawyn is my brother,&rdquo; she
said absently. &ldquo;Galad is not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not be childish,&rdquo; the Amyrlin told her. &ldquo;Sharing
the same father makes Galad your brother, too, whether or not you
like him. I will not allow childishness out of you, girl. A measure
of stupidity can be tolerated in a novice; it is not allowed in one
of the Accepted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mother,&rdquo; Elayne said glumly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Queen left a letter for you with Sheriam. Aside
from giving you the rough side of her tongue, I believe she states
her intention of bringing you home as soon as it is safe for you.
She is sure that in a few more months at most you will be able to
channel without risking killing yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I want to learn, Mother.&rdquo; The iron had returned
to Elayne&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;I want to be Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin&rsquo;s smile was even grimmer than her last.
&ldquo;As well that you do, child, because I have no intention of letting
Morgase have you. You have the potential to be stronger than any
Aes Sedai in a thousand years, and I will not let you go until you
achieve the shawl as well as the ring. Not if I have to grind you
into sausage to do it. <em>I will not let you go</em>. Do I make
myself clear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mother.&rdquo; Elayne sounded uneasy, and Egwene did
not blame her. Caught between Morgase and the White Tower like a
towel between two dogs; caught between the Queen of Andor and the
Amyrlin Seat. If Egwene had ever envied Elayne her wealth and the
throne she would one day occupy, at that moment she surely did
not.</p>

<p>The Amyrlin said briskly, &ldquo;Leane, take Elayne down to
Sheriam&rsquo;s study. I have a few words yet to say to these other two.
Words I do not think they will enjoy hearing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene exchanged startled looks with Nynaeve; for a
moment, worry dissolved the tension between them. <em>What does she
have to say to us and not to Elayne?</em> she wondered. <em>I do
not care, so long as she does not try to stop me learning. But why
not Elayne, too?</em></p>

<p>Elayne grimaced at the mention of the Mistress of
Novices&rsquo;s study, but she drew herself up as Leane came to her side.
