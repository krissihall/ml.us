<h4><em>A Different Dance</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">F</span>urlan
burbled on as he showed them to their rooms,
though Perrin did not really listen. He was too busy wondering if
the black-haired girl knew what yellow eyes meant. <em>Burn me,
she</em> was <em>looking at me</em>. Then he heard the innkeeper
say the words &ldquo;proclaiming the Dragon in Ghealdan,&rdquo; and he thought
his ears would go to sharp points like Loial&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Moiraine stopped dead in the doorway to her room.
&ldquo;There is another false Dragon, innkeeper? In Ghealdan?&rdquo; The hood
of her cloak still hid her face, but she sounded shaken to her
toes. Even listening for the man&rsquo;s reply, Perrin could not help
staring at her; he smelled something close to fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Lady, never you fear. &rsquo;Tis a hundred leagues to
Ghealdan, and none will trouble you here, not with Master Andra
about, and Lord Orban and Lord Gann. Why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Answer her!&rdquo; Lan said harshly. &ldquo;Is there a false
Dragon in Ghealdan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah. Ah, no, Master Andra, not precisely. I said
there&rsquo;s a man proclaiming the Dragon in Ghealdan, so we heard a few
days gone. Preaching his coming, you might say. Talking about that
fellow over in Tarabon we&rsquo;ve heard about. Though some do say &rsquo;tis
Arad Doman, not Tarabon. A long way from here, in any case. Why,
any other day, I expect we&rsquo;d talk more of that than anything else,
except maybe the wild tales about Hawkwing&rsquo;s army come back&mdash;&rdquo;
Lan&rsquo;s cold eyes might as well have been knife blades from the way
Furlan swallowed and scrubbed his hands faster. &ldquo;I only know what I
hear, Master Andra. &rsquo;Tis said the fellow has a stare can pin you
where you stand, and he talks all sorts of rubbish about the Dragon
coming to save us, and we all have to follow, and even the beasts
will fight for the Dragon. I don&rsquo;t know whether they&rsquo;ve arrested
him yet or not. &rsquo;Tis likely; the Ghealdanin would not put up long
with that kind of talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Masema</em>, Perrin thought wonderingly. <em>It&rsquo;s
bloody Masema</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right, innkeeper,&rdquo; Lan said. &ldquo;This fellow
isn&rsquo;t likely to trouble us here. I knew a fellow once who liked to
make wild speeches. You remember him, Lady Alys, don&rsquo;t you?
Masema?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine gave a start. &ldquo;Masema. Yes. Of course. I had
put him out of my mind.&rdquo; Her voice firmed. &ldquo;When next I see Masema,
he will wish someone had peeled his hide to make boots.&rdquo; She
slammed the door behind her so hard that the crash echoed down the
hallway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep a quiet!&rdquo; came a muffled shout from the far
end. &ldquo;My head is splitting!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo; Furlan washed his hands in one direction, then
rubbed them in the other. &ldquo;Ah. Forgive me, Master Andra, but Lady
Alys is a fierce sounding woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only with those who displease her,&rdquo; Lan said
blandly. &ldquo;Her bite is far worse than her bark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah. Ah. Ah. Your rooms are this way. Ah, friend
Ogier, when Master Andra told me you were coming, I had an old
Ogier bed brought from the attic where it has been gathering dust
these three hundred years or more. Why, &rsquo;tis&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin let the words wash over him, hearing them no
more than a river rock hears the water. The black-haired young
woman worried him. And the caged Aiel.</p>

<p>Once in his own room&mdash;a small one in the back;
Lan had done nothing to disabuse the innkeeper of the notion that
Perrin was a servant&mdash;he moved mechanically, still wrapped in
thought. He unstrung his bow and propped it in the corner&mdash;keeping it strung too long ruined bow and string alike&mdash;set
down his blanketroll and saddlebags beside the wash-stand and threw
his cloak across them. He hung his belts with quiver and axe from
pegs on the wall, and nearly lay down on the bed before a
jaw-cracking yawn reminded him how dangerous that might be. The bed
was narrow, and the mattress appeared to be all lumps; it looked
more inviting than any bed he could remember. He sat on the
three-legged stool, instead, and thought. Always he liked to think
things through.</p>

<p>After a time, Loial rapped on the door and put his
head in. The Ogier&rsquo;s ears practically quivered with excitement, and
his grin very nearly split his broad face in two. &ldquo;Perrin, you will
not believe it! My bed is sung wood! Why, it must be well over a
thousand years old. No Treesinger has sung a piece so large in at
least that long. I myself would not care to try it, and I have the
talent more strongly than most, now. Well, to be truthful, there
are not many of us with the talent at all, anymore. But I <em>am</em> among
the best of those who can sing wood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is very interesting,&rdquo; Perrin said. <em>An Aiel
in a cage. That is what Min said. Why was that girl staring at
me?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought it was.&rdquo; Loial sounded a little put out
that he did not share the Ogier&rsquo;s excitement, but all Perrin wanted
to do was think. &ldquo;Supper is ready below, Perrin. They have prepared
their finest in case the Hunters want anything, but we can have
some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go on, Loial. I&rsquo;m not hungry.&rdquo; The smells of
cooking meat floating up from the kitchen did not interest him. He
hardly noticed Loial going.</p>

<p>Hands on his knees, yawning now and again, he tried
to work it out. It seemed like one of those puzzles Master Luhhan
made, the metal pieces appearing to be linked inextricably. But
there was always a trick to make the iron loops and whirls come
apart, and there had to be here, too.</p>

<p>The girl had been looking at him. His eyes might
explain that, except that the innkeeper had ignored them, and no
one else had even noticed. They had an Ogier to look at, and
Hunters of the Horn in the house, and a Lady visiting, and an Aiel
caged in the square. Nothing as small as the color of a man&rsquo;s eyes
could seize their attention; nothing about a servant could compete
with the rest. <em>So why did she pick me to stare at?</em></p>

<p>And the Aiel in the cage. What Min saw was always
important. But how? What was he supposed to do? <em>I could have
stopped those children throwing rocks. I should have</em>. It was
no use telling himself the adults would certainly have told him to
go on about his business, that he was a stranger in Remen and the
Aiel was none of his concern. <em>I should have tried</em>.</p>

<p>No answers came to him, so he went back to the
beginning and patiently worked through it once more, then again,
and again. Still he found nothing except regret for what he had not
done.</p>

<p>It came to him after a time that night had finally
fallen. The room was dark except for a little moonlight through the
lone window. He thought about the tallow candle and the tinderbox
he had seen on the mantel over the narrow fireplace, but there was
more than enough light for his eyes. <em>I have to do something,
don&rsquo;t I?</em></p>

<p>He buckled on his axe, then paused. He had done it
without thinking; wearing the thing had become as natural as
breathing. He did not like that. But he left the belt around his
waist, and went out.</p>

<p>Light from the stairs made the hallway seem almost
bright after his room. Talk and laughter drifted up from the common
room, and cooking smells from the kitchen. He strode toward the
front of the inn, to Moiraine&rsquo;s room, knocked once, and went in.
And stopped, his face burning.</p>

<p>Moiraine pulled the pale blue robe that hung from her
shoulders around herself. &ldquo;You wish something?&rdquo; she asked coolly.
She had a silver-backed hairbrush in one hand, and her dark hair,
spilling down her neck in dark waves, glistened as if she had been
brushing it. Her room was far finer than his, with polished wooden
paneling on the walls and silver-chased lamps and a warm fire on
the wide brick hearth. The air smelled of rose-scented soap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I thought Lan was here,&rdquo; he managed to get
out. &ldquo;You two always have your heads together, and I thought he&rsquo;d&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I thought&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want, Perrin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took a deep breath. &ldquo;Is this Rand&rsquo;s doing? I know
Lan followed him here, and it all seems odd&mdash;the Hunters, and
Aiel&mdash;but did he do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think so. I will know more when Lan tells
me what he discovers tonight. With luck, what he finds will help
with the choice I must make.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A choice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand could have crossed the river and be on his way
to Tear cross-country. Or he could have taken ship downriver to
Illian, meaning to board another there for Tear. The journey is
leagues longer that way, but days faster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we are going to catch him, Moiraine. I
don&rsquo;t know how he&rsquo;s doing it, but even afoot he is staying ahead of
us. If Lan is right, he is still half a day ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could almost suspect he had learned to Travel,&rdquo;
Moiraine said with a small frown, &ldquo;except that if he had, he would
have gone straight to Tear. No, he has the blood of long walkers
and strong runners in him. But we may take the river anyway. If I
cannot catch him, I will be in Tear close behind him. Or waiting
for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin shifted his feet uneasily; there was cold
promise in her voice. &ldquo;You told me once that you could sense a
Darkfriend, one who was far gone into the Shadow, at least. Lan,
too. Have you sensed anything like that here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave a loud sniff and turned back to a tall
standing mirror with finely made silver-work set in the legs.
Holding her robe closed with one hand, she ran the brush through
her hair with the other. &ldquo;Very few humans are so far gone as that,
Perrin, even among the worst Darkfriends.&rdquo; The brush halted in
midstroke. &ldquo;Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a girl down in the common room staring at
me. Not at you and Loial, like everybody else. At me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The brush resumed motion, and a smile briefly touched
Moiraine&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;You sometimes forget, Perrin, that you are a
good-looking young man. Some girls admire a pair of shoulders.&rdquo; He
grunted and shuffled his feet. &ldquo;Was there something else,
Perrin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;no.&rdquo; She could not help with Min&rsquo;s viewing,
not beyond telling him what he already knew, that it was important.
And he did not want to tell her what Min had seen. Or that Min had
seen anything, for that matter.</p>

<p>Back out in the hall with the door closed, he leaned
against the wall for a moment. <em>Light, just walking in on her
like that, and her</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She was a pretty woman. <em>And
likely old enough to be my mother, or more</em>. He thought Mat
would probably have asked her down to the common room to dance.
<em>No, he wouldn&rsquo;t. Even Mat isn&rsquo;t fool enough to try charming an
Aes Sedai</em>. Moiraine did dance. He had danced with her once
himself. And nearly fallen over his own feet with every other step.
<em>Stop thinking about her like a village girl just because you
saw</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>She&rsquo;s bloody Aes Sedai! You have that Aiel to
worry about</em>. He gave himself a shake and went downstairs.</p>

<p>The common room was full as it could be, with every
chair taken, and stools and benches brought in, and those who had
nowhere to sit standing along the walls. He did not see the
black-haired girl, and no one else looked at him twice as he
hurriedly crossed the room.</p>

<p>Orban occupied a table to himself, his bandaged leg
propped up on a chair with a cushion, with a soft slipper on that
foot, a silver goblet in his hand, the serving women keeping it
filled with wine. &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; he was saying to the whole room, &ldquo;we knew
the Aiel for fierce fighters, Gann and I, but there was no time to
hesitate. I drew my sword, and dug my heels into Lion&rsquo;s ribs&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin gave a start before he realized the man meant
his horse was named Lion. <em>Wouldn&rsquo;t put it past him to say he
was riding a lion</em>. He felt a little ashamed; just because he
did not like the man was no reason to suppose the Hunter would take
his boasting that far. He hurried on outside without looking
back.</p>

<p>The street in front of the inn was as crowded as
inside, with people who could not find a place in the common room
peering in through the windows, and twice as many huddling around
the doors to listen to Orban&rsquo;s tale. No one glanced at Perrin
twice, though his passage brought muttered complaints from those
jostled a little further from the door.</p>

<p>Everyone who was out in the night must have been at
the inn, for he saw no one as he walked to the square. Sometimes
the shadow of a person moved across a lighted window, but that was
all. He had the feel of being watched, though, and looked around
uneasily. Nothing but night-cloaked streets dotted with glowing
windows. Around the square, most of the windows were dark except a
few on upper floors.</p>

<p>The gibbet stood as he remembered, the man&mdash;the
Aiel&mdash;still in the cage, hanging higher than he could reach.
The Aiel seemed to be awake&mdash;at least his head was up&mdash;but he never looked down at Perrin. The stones the children had
been throwing were scattered beneath the cage.</p>

<p>The cage hung from a thick rope tied to a ring on one
of the upper bars and running through a heavy pulley on the
crosspiece down to a pair of stubs, waist-high from the bottom of
the upright on either side. The excess rope lay in a careless
tangle of coils at the foot of the gibbet.</p>

<p>Perrin looked around again, searching the dark
square. He still had the feel of being watched, but he still saw
nothing. He listened, and heard nothing. He smelled chimney smoke
and cooking from the houses, and man-sweat and old blood from the
man in the cage. There was no fear scent from him.</p>

<p><em>His weight, and then there&rsquo;s the cage</em>, he
thought as he moved closer to the gibbet. He did not know when he
had decided to do this, or even if he really had decided, but he
knew he was going to do it.</p>

<p>Hooking a leg around the heavy upright, he heaved on
the rope, hoisting the cage enough to gain a little slack. The way
the rope jerked told him the man in the cage had finally moved, but
he was in too much of a hurry to stop and tell him what he was
doing. The slack let him unwind the rope from around the stubs.
Still bracing himself with his leg around the upright, he quickly
lowered the cage hand over hand to the paving blocks.</p>

<p>The Aiel was looking at him now, studying him
silently. Perrin said nothing. When he got a good look at the cage,
his mouth tightened. If a thing was made, even a thing like this,
it should be made well. The entire front of the cage was a door, on
rude hinges made by a hasty hand, held by a good iron lock on a
chain as badly wrought as the cage. He fumbled the chain around
until he found the worst link, then jammed the thick spike on his
axe through it. A sharp twist of his wrist forced the link open. In
seconds he separated the chain, rattled it free, and swung open the
front of the cage.</p>

<p>The Aiel sat there, knees yet under his chin, staring
at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Perrin whispered hoarsely. &ldquo;I opened it, but
I&rsquo;m not going to bloody carry you.&rdquo; He looked hastily around the
night-dark square. Still nothing moved, but he still had the feel
of eyes watching.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are strong, wetlander.&rdquo; The Aiel did not move
beyond working his shoulders. &ldquo;It took three men to hoist me up
there. And now you bring me down. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like seeing people in cages,&rdquo; Perrin
whispered. He wanted to go. The cage was open, and those eyes were
watching. But the Aiel was not moving. <em>If you do a thing, do it
right</em>. &ldquo;Will you get out of there before somebody comes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aiel grasped the frontmost overhead bar of the
cage, heaved himself out and to his feet in one motion, then half
hung there, supporting himself with his grip on the bar. He would
have been nearly a head taller than Perrin, standing straight. He
glanced at Perrin&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;Perrin knew how they must shine,
burnished gold in the moonlight&mdash;but he did not mention them.
&ldquo;I have been in there since yesterday, wetlander.&rdquo; He sounded like
Lan. Not that their voices or accents were anything alike, but the
Aiel had that same unruffled coolness, that same calm sureness. &ldquo;It
will take a moment for my legs to work. I am Gaul, of the Imran
sept of the Shaarad Aiel, wetlander. I am <em>Shae&rsquo;en M&rsquo;taal</em>,
a Stone Dog. My water is yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am Perrin Aybara. Of the Two Rivers. I&rsquo;m a
blacksmith.&rdquo; The man was out of the cage; he could go now. Only, if
anyone came along before Gaul could walk, he would be right back
into the cage unless they killed him, and either way would waste
Perrin&rsquo;s work. &ldquo;If I had thought, I&rsquo;d have brought a waterbottle,
or a skin. Why do you call me &lsquo;wetlander&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gaul gestured toward the river; even Perrin&rsquo;s eyes
could not be sure in the moonlight, but he thought the Aiel looked
uneasy for the first time. &ldquo;Three days ago, I watched a girl
sporting in a huge pool of water. It must have been twenty paces
across. She&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;pulled herself out into it.&rdquo; He made an awkward
swimming gesture with one hand. &ldquo;A brave girl. Crossing these&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;rivers&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;has nearly unmanned me. I never thought there could be
such a thing as too much water, but I never thought there was so
much water in the world as you wetlanders have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin shook his head. He knew the Aiel Waste held
little water&mdash;it was one of the few things he knew about the
Waste or the Aiel&mdash;but he had not thought it could be scarce
enough to cause this reaction. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a long way from home, Gaul.
Why are you here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We search,&rdquo; Gaul said slowly. &ldquo;We look for He Who
Comes With the Dawn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin had heard that name before, under
circumstances that made him sure who it meant. <em>Light, it always
comes back to Rand. I am tied to him like a mean horse for
shoeing</em>. &ldquo;You are looking in the wrong direction, Gaul. I&rsquo;m
looking for him, too, and he is on his way to Tear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tear?&rdquo; The Aiel sounded surprised. &ldquo;Why&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? But
it must be. Prophecy says when the Stone of Tear falls, we will
leave the Three-fold Land at last.&rdquo; That was the Aiel name for the
Waste. &ldquo;It says we will be changed, and find again what was ours,
and was lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That may be. I don&rsquo;t know your prophecies, Gaul. Are
you about ready to leave? Somebody could come any minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is too late to run,&rdquo; Gaul said, and a deep voice
shouted, &ldquo;The savage is lose!&rdquo; Ten or a dozen white-cloaked men
came running across the square, drawing swords, their conical
helmets shining in the moonlight. Children of the Light.</p>

<p>As if he had all the time in the world, Gaul calmly
lifted a dark cloth from his shoulders and wrapped it around his
head, finishing with a thick black veil that hid his face except
for his eyes. &ldquo;Do you like to dance, Perrin Aybara?&rdquo; he asked. With
that, he darted away from the cage. Straight at the oncoming
Whitecloaks.</p>

<p>For an instant they were caught by surprise, but an
instant was apparently all the Aiel needed. He kicked the sword out
of the grip of the first to reach him, then his stiffened hand
struck like a dagger at the Whitecloak&rsquo;s throat, and he slid around
the soldier as he fell. The next man&rsquo;s arm made a loud snap as Gaul
broke it. He pushed that man under the feet of a third, and kicked
a fourth in the face. It <em>was</em> like a dance, from one to the next
without stopping or slowing, though the tripped fellow was climbing
back to his feet, and the one with the broken arm had shifted his
sword. Gaul danced on in the midst of them.</p>

<p>Perrin had only an amazed moment himself, for not all
the Whitecloaks had put their attentions on the Aiel. Barely in
time, he gripped the axe haft with both hands to block a sword
thrust, swung&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and wanted to cry out as the half-moon blade
tore the man&rsquo;s throat. But he had no time for crying out, none for
regrets; more Whitecloaks followed before the first fell. He hated
the gaping wounds the axe made, hated the way it chopped through
mail to rend flesh beneath, split helmet and skull with almost
equal ease. He hated it all. But he did not want to die.</p>

<p>Time seemed to compress and stretch out, both at
once. His body felt as if he fought for hours, and breath rasped
raw in his throat. Men seemed to move as though floating through
jelly. They seemed to leap in an instant from where they started to
where they fell. Sweat rolled down his face, yet he felt as cold as
quenching water. He fought for his life, and he could not have said
whether it lasted seconds or all night.</p>

<p>When he finally stood, panting and nearly stunned,
looking at a dozen white-cloaked men lying on the paving blocks of
the square, the moon appeared not to have moved at all. Some of the
men groaned; others lay silent and still. Gaul stood among them,
still veiled, still empty-handed. Most of the men down were his
work. Perrin wished they all were, and felt ashamed. The smell of
blood and death was sharp and bitter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not dance the spears badly, Perrin
Aybara.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Head spinning, Perrin muttered, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how
twelve men fought twenty of you and won, even if two of them are
Hunters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that what they say?&rdquo; Gaul laughed softly. &ldquo;Sarien
and I were careless, being so long in these soft lands, and the
wind was from the wrong direction, so we smelled nothing. We walked
into them before we knew it. Well, Sarien is dead, and I was caged
like a fool, so perhaps we paid enough. It is time for running now,
wetlander. Tear; I will remember it.&rdquo; At last he lowered the black
veil. &ldquo;May you always find water and shade, Perrin Aybara.&rdquo;
Turning, he ran into the night.</p>

<p>Perrin started to run, too, then realized he had a
bloody axe in his hand. Hastily he wiped the curved blade on a dead
man&rsquo;s cloak. <em>He&rsquo;s dead, burn me, and there&rsquo;s blood on it
already</em>. He made himself put the haft back through the loop on
his belt before he broke into a trot.</p>

<p>At his second step he saw her, a slim shape at the
edge of the square, in dark, narrow skirts. She turned to run; he
could see they were divided for riding. She darted back into the
street and vanished.</p>

<p>Lan met him before he reached the place where she had
been standing. The Warder took in the cage sitting empty beneath
the gibbet, the shadowed white mounds that caught the moonlight,
and he tossed his head as if he were about to erupt. In a voice as
tight and hard as a new wheel rim, he said, &ldquo;Is this your work,
blacksmith? The Light burn me! Is there anyone who can connect it
to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A girl,&rdquo; Perrin said. &ldquo;I think she saw. I don&rsquo;t want
you to hurt her, Lan! Plenty of others could have seen, too. There
are lighted windows all around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Warder grabbed Perrin&rsquo;s coat sleeve and gave him
a push toward the inn. &ldquo;I saw a girl running, but I thought&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;No matter. You dig the Ogier out and haul him down to the stable.
After this, we need to get our horses to the docks as quickly as
possible. The Light alone knows if there is a ship sailing tonight,
or what I&rsquo;ll have to pay to hire one if there isn&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t ask
questions, blacksmith! Do it! Run!&rdquo;</p>
