<h4><em>To Race the Shadow</em></h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">F</span>rom
the small courtyard with its pool of fish,
Tallanvor led Mat swiftly to the great court at the front of the
Palace, behind the tall, gilded gates gleaming in the sun. It would
be midday, soon. Mat felt an urge to be gone, a need to hurry. It
was hard keeping his pace to the young officer&rsquo;s. Someone might
wonder, if he started running, and maybe&mdash;just maybe&mdash;things had really been the way they seemed back there. Maybe
Gaebril really did not suspect that he knew. <em>Maybe</em>. He
remembered those nearly black eyes, seizing and holding like a pair
of pitchfork tines through his head. <em>Light, maybe</em>. He
forced himself to walk as if he had all the time in the world&mdash;<em>Just a haybrain country lout staring at the rugs and the
gold. Just a mudfoot who&rsquo;d never think anyone might put a knife in
his back</em>&mdash;until Tallanvor let him through a sallyport in
one of the gates, and followed him out.</p>

<p>The fat officer with the rat&rsquo;s eyes was still there
with the Guards, and when he saw Mat his face went red again.
Before he could open his mouth, though, Tallanvor spoke. &ldquo;He has
delivered a letter to the Queen from the Daughter-Heir. Be glad,
Elber, that neither Morgase nor Gaebril knows you tried to keep it
from them. Lord Gaebril was most interested in the Lady Elayne&rsquo;s
missive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elber&rsquo;s face went from red to as white as his collar.
He glared once at Mat, and scuttled back along the line of
guardsmen, his beady eyes peering through the bars of their
face-guards as if to determine whether any of them had seen his
fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Mat told Tallanvor, and meant it. He had
forgotten all about the fat man until he was staring him in the
face again. &ldquo;Fare you well, Tallanvor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He started across the oval plaza, trying not to walk
too fast, and was surprised when Tallanvor walked along. <em>Light,
is he Gaebril&rsquo;s man, or Morgase&rsquo;s?</em> He was just beginning to
feel an itch between his shoulder blades, as if a knife might be
about to go in&mdash;<em>He doesn&rsquo;t know, burn me! Gaebril doesn&rsquo;t
suspect I know!</em>&mdash;when the young officer finally
spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you spend long in Tar Valon? In the White Tower?
Long enough to learn anything of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was only there three days,&rdquo; Mat said cautiously.
He would have made the time less&mdash;if he could have delivered
the letter without admitting ever being in Tar Valon, he would have&mdash;but he did not think the man would believe he had gone all
that way to see his sister and left the same day. <em>What under
the Light is he after?</em> &ldquo;I learned what I saw in that time.
Nothing of any importance. They did not guide me around and tell me
things. I was only there to see Else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must have heard something, man. Who is Sheriam?
Does talking to her in her study mean anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat shook his head vigorously to keep relief from
showing on his face. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who she is,&rdquo; he said truthfully.
Perhaps he had heard Egwene, or perhaps Nynaeve, mention the name.
An Aes Sedai, maybe? &ldquo;Why should it mean anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; Tallanvor said softly. &ldquo;There is too
much I do not know. Sometimes I think she is trying to say
something&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He gave Mat a sharp look. &ldquo;Are you a loyal
Andorman, Thom Grinwell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I am.&rdquo; <em>Light, if I say that much more
often, I may start believing it</em>. &ldquo;What about you? Do you serve
Morgase and Gaebril loyally?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tallanvor gave him a look as hard as the dice&rsquo;s
mercy. &ldquo;I serve Morgase, Thom Grinwell. Her, I serve to the death.
Fare you well!&rdquo; He turned and strode back toward the Palace with a
hand gripping his sword hilt.</p>

<p>Watching him go, Mat muttered to himself. &ldquo;I will
wager this&rdquo;&mdash;he gave Gaebril&rsquo;s wash-leather purse a toss&mdash;&ldquo;that Gaebril says the same.&rdquo; Whatever games they played in
the Palace, he wanted no place in any of them. And he meant to make
sure Egwene and the others were out of them, too. <em>Fool women!
Now I have to keep their bacon from burning instead of looking
after my own!</em> He did not start to run until the streets hid
him from the Palace.</p>

<p>When he came dashing into The Queen&rsquo;s Blessing,
nothing very much had changed in the library. Thom and the
innkeeper still sat over the stones board&mdash;a different game,
he saw from the positions of the stones, but no better for Gill&mdash;and the calico cat was back on the table, washing herself. A
tray holding their unlit pipes and the remains of a meal for two
sat near the cat, and his belongings were gone from the armchair.
Each man had a wine cup at his elbow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will be leaving, Master Gill,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You can
keep the coin and take a meal out of it. I&rsquo;ll stay long enough to
eat, but then I am on the road to Tear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your hurry, boy?&rdquo; Thom seemed to be watching
the cat more than the board. &ldquo;We only just arrived here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You delivered the Lady Elayne&rsquo;s letter, then?&rdquo; the
innkeeper said eagerly. &ldquo;And kept your skin whole, it seems. Did
you really climb over that wall like the other young man? No, that
does not matter. Did the letter soothe Morgase? Do we still have to
keep tiptoeing on eggs, man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose it soothed her,&rdquo; Mat said. &ldquo;I think it
did.&rdquo; He hesitated a moment, bouncing Gaebril&rsquo;s purse on his hand.
It made a clinking sound. He had not looked to see if it really
held ten gold marks; the weight was about right. &ldquo;Master Gill, what
can you tell me of Gaebril? Aside from the fact that he does not
like Aes Sedai. You said he had not been in Caemlyn long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you want to know about him?&rdquo; Thom asked.
&ldquo;Basel, are you going to place a stone or not?&rdquo; The innkeeper
sighed and stuck a black stone on the board, and the gleeman shook
his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, lad,&rdquo; Gill said, &ldquo;there is not much to tell.
He came out of the west during the winter. Somewhere out your way,
I think. Maybe it was the Two Rivers. I&rsquo;ve heard the mountains
mentioned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have no lords in the Two Rivers,&rdquo; Mat said.
&ldquo;Maybe there are some up around Baerlon. I do not know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That could be it, lad. I had never even heard of him
before, but I do not keep up with the country lords. Came while
Morgase was still in Tar Valon, he did, and half the city was
afraid the Tower was going to make her disappear, too. The other
half did not want her back. The riots started up again, the way
they did last year at the tail of winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat shook his head. &ldquo;I do not care about politics,
Master Gill. It&rsquo;s Gaebril I want to know about.&rdquo; Thom frowned at
him, and began cleaning the dottle from his long-stemmed pipe with
a straw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is Gaebril I am telling you about, lad,&rdquo; Gill
said. &ldquo;During the riots, he made himself leader of the faction
supporting Morgase&mdash;got himself wounded in the fighting, I
hear&mdash;and by the time she returned, he had it all suppressed.
Gareth Bryne didn&rsquo;t like Gaebril&rsquo;s methods&mdash;he can be a very
hard man&mdash;but Morgase was so pleased to find order restored
that she named him to the post Elaida used to hold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The innkeeper stopped. Mat waited for him to go on,
but he did not. Thom thumbed his pipe full of tabac and walked over
to light a spill at a small lamp kept for the purpose on the mantel
above the fireplace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What else?&rdquo; Mat asked. &ldquo;The man has to have a reason
for what he does. If he marries Morgase, would he be king when she
dies? If Elayne were dead, too, I mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom choked lighting his pipe, and Gill laughed.
&ldquo;Andor has a queen, lad. Always a queen. If Morgase and Elayne both
died&mdash;the Light send it not so!&mdash;then Morgase&rsquo;s nearest
female relative would take the throne. At least there is no
question of who that is this time&mdash;a cousin, the Lady Dyelin&mdash;not like the Succession, after Tigraine vanished. It took a
year before Morgase sat on the Lion Throne, then. Dyelin could keep
Gaebril as her advisor, or marry him to cement the line&mdash;though she would not likely do that unless Morgase had had a child
by him&mdash;but he would be the Prince Consort even then. No more
than that. Thank the Light, Morgase is a young woman, yet. And
Elayne is healthy. Light! The letter did not say she is ill, did
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is well.&rdquo; <em>For now, at least</em>. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t
there anything else you can tell me about him? You do not seem to
like him. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The innkeeper frowned in thought, and scratched his
chin, and shook his head. &ldquo;I suppose I would not like him marrying
Morgase, but I do not truly know why. He&rsquo;s said to be a fine man;
the nobles all look to him. I do not like most of the men he&rsquo;s
brought into the Guards. Too much has changed since he came, but I
cannot lay it all at his door. There just seem to be too many
people muttering in corners since he came. You would think we were
all Cairhienin, the way they were before this civil war, all
plotting and trying to find advantage. I keep having bad dreams
since Gaebril came, and I am not the only one. Fool thing to worry
about, dreams. It is probably only worry about Elayne, and what
Morgase means to do concerning the White Tower, and people acting
like Cairhienin. I just do not know. Why are you asking all these
questions about Lord Gaebril?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because he wants to kill Elayne,&rdquo; Mat said, &ldquo;and
Egwene and Nynaeve with her.&rdquo; There was nothing useful in what Gill
had told him that he could see. <em>Burn me, I don&rsquo;t have to know
why he wants them dead. I just have to stop it</em>. Both men were
staring at him again. As if he were mad. Again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you coming down sick again?&rdquo; Gill said
suspiciously. &ldquo;I remember you staring crossways at everyone the
last time. It&rsquo;s either that, or else you think this is some sort of
prank. You have the look of a prankster to me. If that is it, it&rsquo;s
a nasty one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat grimaced. &ldquo;It is no bloody prank. I overheard him
telling some man called Comar to cut Elayne&rsquo;s head off. And
Egwene&rsquo;s and Nynaeve&rsquo;s while he was about it. A big man, with a
white stripe in his beard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That does sound like Lord Comar,&rdquo; Gill said slowly.
&ldquo;He was a fine soldier, but it is said he left the Guard over some
matter of weighted dice. Not that anyone says it to his face; Comar
was one of the best blades in the Guards. You really mean it, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think he does, Basel,&rdquo; Thom said. &ldquo;I very much
think he does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light shine on us! What did Morgase say? You did
tell her, didn&rsquo;t you? The Light burn you, you did tell her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, I did,&rdquo; Mat said bitterly. &ldquo;With Gaebril
standing right there, and her gazing at him like a lovesick lapdog!
I said, &lsquo;I may be a simple village man who just climbed over your
wall half an hour past, but I already happen to know your trusted
advisor there, the one you seem to be in love with, intends to
murder your daughter.&rsquo; Light, man, she&rsquo;d have cut my head off!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She might have at that.&rdquo; Thom stared into the
elaborate carvings on the bowl of his pipe and tugged one mustache.
&ldquo;Her temper was ever as sudden as lightning, and twice as
dangerous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know it better than most, Thom,&rdquo; Gill said
absently. Staring at nothing, he scrubbed both hands through his
graying hair. &ldquo;There has to be something I can do. I haven&rsquo;t held a
sword since the Aiel War, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Well, that would do no good.
Get myself killed and do nothing by it. But I must do
something!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rumor.&rdquo; Thom rubbed the side of his nose; he seemed
to be studying the stones board and talking to himself. &ldquo;No one can
keep rumors from reaching Morgase&rsquo;s ears, and if she hears it
strongly enough, she will start to wonder. Rumor is the voice of
the people, and the voice of the people often speaks truth. Morgase
knows that. There is not a man alive I would back against her in
the Game. Love or no love, once Morgase starts examining Gaebril
closely, he&rsquo;ll not be able to hide as much as his childhood scars
from her. And if she learns he means harm to Elayne&rdquo;&mdash;he
placed a stone on the board; it seemed an odd placement at first
glance, but Mat saw that in three more moves, a third of Gill&rsquo;s
stones would be trapped&mdash;&ldquo;Lord Gaebril will have a most
elaborate funeral.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You and your Game of Houses,&rdquo; Gill muttered. &ldquo;Still,
it might work. &ldquo;A sudden smile appeared on his face. &ldquo;I even know
who to tell to start it. All I need do is mention to Gilda that I
dreamed it, and in three days she&rsquo;ll have told serving girls in
half the New City that it is a fact. She is the greatest gossip the
Creator ever made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just be certain it cannot be traced back to you,
Basel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No fear of that, Thom. Why a week ago, a man told me
one of my own bad dreams as a thing he&rsquo;d heard from somebody who&rsquo;d
had it from someone else. Gilda must have eavesdropped on me
telling it to Coline, but when I asked, he gave me a string of
names that led all the way to the other side of Caemlyn and
vanished. Why, I actually went over there and found the last man,
just out of curiosity to see how many mouths had passed it, and he
claimed it was his very own dream. No fear, Thom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat did not really care what they did with their
rumors&mdash;no rumors would help Egwene or the others&mdash;but
one thing puzzled him. &ldquo;Thom, you seem to be taking this all very
calmly. I thought Morgase was the great love of your life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gleeman stared into the bowl of his pipe again.
&ldquo;Mat, a very wise woman once told me that time would heal my
wounds, that time smoothed everything over. I didn&rsquo;t believe her.
Only she was right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean you do not love Morgase anymore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boy, it has been fifteen years since I left Caemlyn
a half step ahead of the headsman&rsquo;s axe, with the ink of Morgase&rsquo;s
signature still wet on the warrant. Sitting here listening to Basel
natter on&rdquo;&mdash;Gill protested, and Thom raised his voice&mdash;&ldquo;natter on, I say, about Morgase and Gaebril, and how they might
marry, I realized the passion faded a long time gone. Oh, I suppose
I am still fond of her, perhaps I even love her a little, but it is
not a grand passion anymore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And here I half thought you&rsquo;d go running up to the
Palace to warn her.&rdquo; He laughed, and was surprised when Thom joined
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not so big a fool as that, boy. Any fool knows
men and women think differently at times, but the biggest
difference is this. Men forget, but never forgive; women forgive,
but never forget. Morgase might kiss my cheek and give me a cup of
wine and say how she has missed me. And then she might just let the
Guards haul me off to prison and the headsman. No. Morgase is one
of the most capable women I&rsquo;ve ever known, and that is saying
something. I could almost pity Gaebril once she learns what he is
up to. Tear, you say? Is there any chance of you waiting until
tomorrow to leave? I could use a night&rsquo;s sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean to be as far toward Tear as I can before
nightfall.&rdquo; Mat blinked. &ldquo;Do you mean to come with me? I thought
you meant to stay here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you not just hear me say I had decided <em>
not</em> to have my head cut off? Tear sounds a safer place to me
than Caemlyn, and suddenly that does not seem so bad. Besides, I
like those girls.&rdquo; A knife appeared in his hand and was as suddenly
gone again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d not like anything to happen to them. But if you
mean to reach Tear quickly, it&rsquo;s Aringill you want. A fast boat
will have us there days sooner than horses, even if we rode them to
death. And I don&rsquo;t say it just because my bottom has already taken
on the shape of a saddle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aringill, then. As long as it&rsquo;s fast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Gill said, &ldquo;I suppose if you are leaving,
lad, I had better see about getting you that meal.&rdquo; He pushed back
his chair and started for the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold this for me, Master Gill,&rdquo; Mat said, and tossed
him the wash-leather purse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this, lad? Coin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stakes. Gaebril doesn&rsquo;t know it, but he and I have a
wager.&rdquo; The cat jumped down as Mat picked up the wooden dice cup
and spun the dice out on the table. Five sixes. &ldquo;And I always
win.&rdquo;</p>
