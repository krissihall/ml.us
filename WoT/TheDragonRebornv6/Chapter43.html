<h4><em>Shadowbrothers</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
dark-eyed girl climbed back on her table and
started singing again, in an unsteady voice. The tune was one
Perrin knew as &ldquo;Mistress Aynora&rsquo;s Rooster,&rdquo; and though the words
were different once more, to his disappointment&mdash;and
embarrassment that he was disappointed&mdash;it actually was about
a rooster. Mistress Luhhan herself would not have disapproved.
<em>Light, I&rsquo;m getting as bad as Mat</em>.</p>

<p>None of the listeners complained; some of the men did
look a bit disgruntled, but they seemed to be as anxious about what
Moiraine might approve as the singer was. No one wished to offend
an Aes Sedai, even with her gone. Bili came back and hoisted two
more Gray Men; a few of the men listening to the song glanced at
the corpses and shook their heads. One of them spat on the
sawdust.</p>

<p>Lan came to stand in front of Perrin. &ldquo;How did you
know them, blacksmith?&rdquo; he asked quietly. &ldquo;Their taint of evil is
not strong enough for Moiraine or me to sense. Gray Men have walked
past a hundred guards without being noticed, and Warders among
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very conscious of Zarine&rsquo;s eyes on him, Perrin tried
to make his voice even softer than Lan&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I smelled them.
I&rsquo;ve smelled them before, at Jarra and at Remen, but it always
vanished. They were gone before we got there, both times.&rdquo; He was
not sure whether Zarine had overheard or not; she was leaning
forward trying to listen, and trying to appear not to at the same
time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Following Rand, then. Following you, now,
blacksmith.&rdquo; The Warder gave no visible sign of surprise. He raised
his voice to a more normal level. &ldquo;I am going to look around
outside, blacksmith. Your eyes might see something I miss.&rdquo; Perrin
nodded; it was a measure of the Warder&rsquo;s worry that he asked for
help. &ldquo;Ogier, your folk see better than most, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, ah,&rdquo; Loial said. &ldquo;Well, I suppose I could take a
look, too.&rdquo; His big, round eyes rolled sideways toward the two Gray
Men still on the floor. &ldquo;I would not think any more of them were
out there. Would you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are we looking for, stone-face?&rdquo; Zarine
said.</p>

<p>Lan eyed her a moment, then shook his head as if he
had decided not to say something. &ldquo;Whatever we find, girl. I will
know it when I see it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin thought about going upstairs for his axe, but
the Warder made for the door, and he was not wearing his sword.
<em>He hardly needs it</em>, Perrin thought grumpily. <em>He is
almost as dangerous without it as with</em>. He held on to the
chair leg as he followed. It was a relief to see that Zarine still
had her knife in her hand.</p>

<p>Thick black clouds were roiling overhead. The street
was as dark as late twilight, and empty of people who had
apparently not waited to be caught in the rain. One fellow was
running across a bridge down the street; he was the only person
Perrin saw in any direction. The wind was picking up, blowing a rag
along the uneven paving stones; another, caught under the edge of
one of the mounting blocks, flapped with a small snapping sound.
Thunder grumbled and rolled.</p>

<p>Perrin wrinkled his nose. There was a smell of
fireworks on that wind. <em>No, not fireworks, exactly</em>. It was
a burned sulphur sort of smell. Almost.</p>

<p>Zarine tapped the chair leg in his hands with her
knife blade. &ldquo;You really are strong, big man. You tore that chair
apart as if it were made of twigs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin grunted. He realized he was standing
straighter, and deliberately made himself slouch. <em>Fool
girl!</em> Zarine laughed softly, and suddenly he did not know
whether to straighten or stay as he was. <em>Fool!</em> This time
he meant it for himself. <em>You&rsquo;re supposed to be looking. For
what?</em> He did not see anything but the street, did not smell
anything but the almost burned sulphur scent. And Zarine, of
course.</p>

<p>Loial appeared to be wondering what it was he was
looking for, too. He scratched a tufted ear, peered one way down
the street, then the other, then scratched the other ear. Then he
stared up at the roof of the inn.</p>

<p>Lan appeared from the alleyway beside the inn and
moved out into the street, eyes studying the darker shadows along
the buildings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe he missed seeing something,&rdquo; Perrin muttered,
though he found it hard to believe, and turned toward the alley.
<em>I am supposed to be looking, so I&rsquo;ll look. Maybe he did miss
something</em>.</p>

<p>Lan had stopped a little way down the street, staring
at the paving stones in front of his feet. The Warder started back
toward the inn, walking quickly, but peering at the street ahead of
him as if following something. Whatever it was led straight to one
of the mounting blocks, almost beside the inn door. He stopped
there, staring at the top of the gray stone block.</p>

<p>Perrin decided to abandon going down the alley&mdash;it stank as much as the canals in this part of Illian, for one
thing&mdash;and walked over to Lan, instead. He saw what the
Warder was staring at right away. Pressed into the top of the stone
mounting block were two prints, as if a huge hound had rested its
forepaws there. The smell that was almost burned sulphur was
strongest here. <em>Dogs don&rsquo;t make footprints in stone. Light,
they don&rsquo;t!</em> He could make out the trail Lan had followed, too.
The hound had trotted up the street as far as the mounting block,
then turned and gone back the way it had come. Leaving tracks in
the stone as if they had been a plowed field. <em>They just
don&rsquo;t!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Darkhound,&rdquo; Lan said, and Zarine gasped. Loial
moaned softly. For an Ogier. &ldquo;A Darkhound leaves no mark on dirt,
blacksmith, not even on mud, but stone is another matter. There
hasn&rsquo;t been a Darkhound seen south of the Mountains of Dhoom since
the Trolloc Wars. This one was hunting for something, I&rsquo;d say. And
now that it has found it, it has gone to tell its master.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Me?</em> Perrin thought. <em>Gray Men and
Darkhounds hunting me? This is crazy!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you telling me Nieda was right?&rdquo; Zarine demanded
in a shaky voice. &ldquo;Old Grim is really riding with the Wild Hunt?
Light! I always thought it was just a story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a complete fool, girl,&rdquo; Lan said harshly.
&ldquo;If the Dark One were free, we&rsquo;d all be worse than dead by now.&rdquo; He
peered off down the street, the way the tracks went. &ldquo;But
Darkhounds are real enough. Almost as dangerous as Myrddraal, and
harder to kill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you bring Fetches into it,&rdquo; Zarine muttered.
&ldquo;Gray Men. Fetches. Darkhounds. You had better lead me to the Horn
of Valere, farmboy. What other surprises do you have waiting for
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No questions,&rdquo; Lan told her. &ldquo;You still know little
enough that Moiraine will release you from your oath, if you swear
not to follow. I&rsquo;ll take that oath myself, and you can go now. You
would be wise to give it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will not frighten me away, stone-face,&rdquo; Zarine
said. &ldquo;I do not frighten easily.&rdquo; But she sounded frightened. And
smelled it, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a question,&rdquo; Perrin said, &ldquo;and I want an
answer. You didn&rsquo;t sense this Darkhound, Lan, and neither did
Moiraine. Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Warder was silent for a time. &ldquo;The answer to
that, blacksmith,&rdquo; he said grimly at last, &ldquo;may be more than you or
I, either one, want to know. I hope the answer does not kill us
all. You three get what sleep you can. I doubt we will stay the
night in Illian, and I fear we have hard riding ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; Perrin asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going after Moiraine. To tell her about the
Darkhound. She can&rsquo;t be angry with me for following for that, not
when she would not know it was there until it took her throat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first big drops of rain splatted on the paving
stones as they went back inside. Bili had removed the last of the
dead Gray Men and was sweeping up the sawdust where they had bled.
The dark-eyed girl was singing a sad song about a boy leaving his
love. Mistress Luhhan would have enjoyed it greatly.</p>

<p>Lan ran ahead of them, across the common room and up
the stairs, and by the time Perrin reached the second floor, the
Warder was already starting back down, buckling his sword belt on,
color-shifting cloak hanging over his arm as if he hardly cared who
saw it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he is wearing that in a city&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Loial&rsquo;s
shaggy hair almost brushed the ceiling as he shook his head. &ldquo;I do
not know if I can sleep, but I will try. Dreams will be more
pleasant than staying awake.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Not always, Loial</em>, Perrin thought as the
Ogier went on down the hall.</p>

<p>Zarine seemed to want to stay with him, but he told
her to go to sleep and firmly shut the slatted door in her face. He
stared at his own bed reluctantly as he stripped down to his
underbreeches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to find out,&rdquo; he sighed, and crawled onto the
bed. Rain drummed down outside, and thunder boomed. The breeze
across his bed carried some of the rain&rsquo;s coolness, but he did not
think he would need any of the blankets at the foot of the
mattress. His last thought before sleep claimed him was that he had
forgotten to light a candle again, though the room was dark. <em>
Careless. Mustn&rsquo;t be careless. Carelessness ruins the
work</em>.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Dreams tumbled through his head. Darkhounds chasing
him; he never saw them, but he could hear their howling. Fades, and
Gray Men. A tall, slender man flashed into them again and again, in
richly embroidered coat and boots with gold fringe; most of the
time he held what seemed to be a sword, shining like the sun, and
laughed triumphantly. Sometimes the man sat on a throne, and kings
and queens groveled before him. These felt strange, as if they were
not really his dreams at all.</p>

<p>Then the dreams changed, and he knew he was in the
wolf dream he sought. This time he had hoped for it.</p>

<p>He stood atop a high, flat-topped stone spire, the
wind ruffling his hair, bringing a thousand dry scents and a faint
hint of water hidden in the far distance. For an instant he thought
he had the form of a wolf, and fumbled at his own body to make sure
what he saw was really him. He wore his own coat and breeches and
boots; he held his bow, and his quiver hung at his side. The axe
was not there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hopper! Hopper, where are you?&rdquo; The wolf did not
come.</p>

<p>Rugged mountains surrounded him, and other tall
spires separated by arid flats and jumbled ridges, and sometimes a
large plateau rising with sheer sides. Things grew, but nothing
lush. Tough, short grass. Bushes wiry and covered with thorn, and
other things that even seemed to have thorns on their fat leaves.
Scattered, stunted trees, twisted by the wind. Yet wolves could
find hunting even in this land.</p>

<p>As he peered at this rough land, a circle of darkness
suddenly blanked out a part of the mountains; he could not have
said whether the darkness was right in front of his face or halfway
to the mountains, but he seemed to be seeing through it, and
beyond. Mat, rattling a dice cup. His opponent stared at Mat with
eyes of fire. Mat did not seem to see the man, but Perrin knew
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Ba&rsquo;alzamon! Light, Mat,
you&rsquo;re dicing with Ba&rsquo;alzamon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat made his toss, and as the dice spun, the vision
faded, and the dark place was dry mountains again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hopper!&rdquo; Perrin turned slowly, looking in every
direction. He even looked up in the sky&mdash;<em>He can fly,
now</em>&mdash;where clouds promised a rain the ground far below
the spire top would drink up as soon as it fell. &ldquo;Hopper!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A darkness formed among the clouds, a hole into
somewhere else. Egwene and Nynaeve and Elayne stood looking at a
huge metal cage, with a raised door held on a heavy spring. They
stepped in and reached up together to loose the catch. The barred
door snapped down behind them. A woman with her hair all in braids
laughed at them, and another woman all in white laughed at her. The
hole in the sky closed, and there were only clouds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hopper, where are you?&rdquo; he called.&rdquo; I need you!
Hopper!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the grizzled wolf was there, alighting on the
spire top as if he had leaped from somewhere higher.</p>

<p><em>Dangerous. You have been warned, Young Bull. Too
young. Too new yet.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;I need to know, Hopper. You said there were things I
must see. I need to see more, know more.&rdquo; He hesitated, thinking of
Mat, of Egwene and Nynaeve and Elayne. &ldquo;The strange things I see
here. Are they real?&rdquo; Hopper&rsquo;s sending seemed slow, as if it were
so simple the wolf could not understand the need to explain it, or
how to. Finally, though, something came.</p>

<p><em>What is real is not real. What is not real is
real. Flesh is a dream, and dreams have flesh</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t tell me anything, Hopper. I do not
understand.&rdquo; The wolf looked at him, as if he had said he did not
understand that water was wet. &ldquo;You said I had to see something,
and you showed me Ba&rsquo;alzamon, and Lanfear.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Heartfang. Moonhunter</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you show me, Hopper? Why did I have to see
them?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>The Last Hunt comes</em>. Sadness filled the
sending, and a sense of inevitability. <em>What will be must
be</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not understand! The Last Hunt? What Last Hunt?
Hopper, Gray Men came to kill me tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>The Notdead hunt you?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! Gray Men! After me! And a Darkhound was right
outside the inn! I want to know why they&rsquo;re after me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Shadowbrothers!</em> Hopper crouched, looking to
either side as if he almost expected an attack. <em>Long since we
have seen the Shadowbrothers. You must go, Young Bull. Great
danger! Flee the Shadowbrothers!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are they after me, Hopper? You do know. I know
you do!&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Flee, Young Bull</em>. Hopper leaped, forepaws
hitting Perrin&rsquo;s chest, knocking him back, over the edge. <em>Flee
the Shadowbrothers</em>.</p>

<p>The wind rushed in his ears as he fell. Hopper and
the edge of the spire top dwindled above him. &ldquo;Why, Hopper?&rdquo; he
shouted. &ldquo;I have to know why!&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>The Last Hunt comes</em>.</p>

<p>He was going to hit. He knew it. The ground below
rushed up at him, and he tensed against the crushing impact that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">He started awake, staring at the candle flickering on
the small table beside the bed. Lightning flashes lit the window,
and thunder rattled it. &ldquo;What did he mean, the Last Hunt?&rdquo; he
mumbled. <em>I did not light any candle</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You talk to yourself. And thrash in your sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He jumped, and cursed himself for not having noticed
the herbal scent in the air. Zarine sat on a stool at the edge of
the candlelight, elbow on her knee, chin on her fist, watching
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>,&rdquo; she said as if ticking
off a point. &ldquo;Stone-face thinks those odd eyes of yours can see
things his can&rsquo;t. Gray Men want to kill you. You travel with an Aes
Sedai, a Warder, and an Ogier. You free caged Aiel and kill
Whitecloaks. Who are you, farmboy, the Dragon Reborn?&rdquo; Her voice
said that was the most ridiculous thing she could think of, but he
still shifted uneasily. &ldquo;Whoever you are, big man,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;you
could do with a little more hair on your chest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He twisted around, cursing, and scrabbled one of the
blankets over him to his neck. <em>Light, she keeps making me jump
like a frog on a hot rock</em>. Zarine&rsquo;s face was at the edge of
shadows. He could not see her clearly except when lightning shone
through the window, the harsh illumination casting its own shadows
across her strong nose and high cheekbones. Suddenly he remembered
Min saying he should run from a beautiful woman. Once he had
recognized Lanfear in that wolf dream, he had thought Min must mean
her&mdash;he did not think it was possible for a woman to be any
more beautiful than Lanfear&mdash;but she was just in a dream.
Zarine was sitting there staring at him with those dark, tilted
eyes, considering, weighing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;What do you
want? Who are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She threw back her head and laughed. &ldquo;I am Faile,
farmboy, a Hunter of the Horn. Who do you think I am, the woman of
your dreams? Why did you jump that way? You would think I had
goosed you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before he could find words, the door crashed back
against the wall, and Moiraine stood in the doorway, her face as
pale and grim as death. &ldquo;Your wolf dreams tell as truly as a
Dreamer&rsquo;s, Perrin. The Forsaken <em>are</em> loose, and one of them
rules in Illian.&rdquo;</p>
