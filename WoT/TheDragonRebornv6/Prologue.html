<p class="prophecy">And his paths shall be many, and who shall know his
name, for he shall be born among us many times, in many guises, as
he has been and ever will be, time without end. His coming shall be
like the sharp edge of the plow, turning our lives in furrows from
out of the places where we live in silence. The breaker of bonds;
the forger of chains. The maker of futures; the unshaper of
destiny.</p>

<h4><em>Fortress of the Light</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">P</span>edron
Niall&rsquo;s aged gaze wandered about his private
audience chamber, but dark eyes hazed with thought saw nothing.
Tattered wall hangings, once battle banners of the enemies of his
youth, faded into dark wood paneling laid over stone walls, thick
even here in the heart of the Fortress of the Light. The single
chair in the room&mdash;heavy, high-backed, and almost a throne&mdash;was as invisible to him as the few scattered tables that
completed the furnishings. Even the white-cloaked man kneeling with
barely restrained eagerness on the great sunburst set in the wide
planks of the floor had vanished from Niall&rsquo;s mind for the moment,
though few would have dismissed him so lightly.</p>

<p>Jaret Byar had been given time to wash before being
brought to Niall, but both his helmet and his breastplate were
dulled from travel and battered from use. Dark, deep-set eyes shone
with a feverish, urgent light in a face that seemed to have had
every spare scrap of flesh boiled away. He wore no sword&mdash;none was allowed in Niall&rsquo;s presence&mdash;but he seemed poised on
the edge of violence, like a hound awaiting the loosing of the
leash.</p>

<p>Twin fires on long hearths at either end of the room
held off the late winter cold. It was a plain, soldier&rsquo;s room,
really, everything well made but nothing extravagant&mdash;except
for the sunburst. Furnishings came to the audience chamber of the
Lord Captain Commander of the Children of the Light with the man
who rose to the office; the flaring sun of coin gold had been worn
smooth by generations of petitioners, replaced and worn smooth
again. Gold enough to buy any estate in Amadicia, and the patent of
nobility to go with it. For ten years Niall had walked across that
gold and never thought of it twice, any more than he thought of the
sunburst embroidered across the chest of his white tunic. Gold held
little interest for Pedron Niall.</p>

<p>Eventually his eyes went back to the table next to
him, covered with maps and scattered letters and reports. Three
loosely rolled drawings lay among the jumble. He took one up
reluctantly. It did not matter which; all depicted the same scene,
though by different hands.</p>

<p>Niall&rsquo;s skin was as thin as scraped parchment, drawn
tight by age over a body that seemed all bone and sinew, but there
was nothing of frailty about him. No man held Niall&rsquo;s office before
his hair was white, nor did any man softer than the stones of the
Dome of Truth. Still, he was suddenly aware of the tendon-ridged
back of the hand holding the drawing, aware of the need for haste.
Time was growing short. <em>His</em> time was growing short. It had
to be enough. He had to make it enough.</p>

<p>He made himself unroll the thick parchment halfway,
just enough to see the face that interested him. The chalks were a
little smudged from travel in saddlebags, but the face was clear. A
gray-eyed youth with reddish hair. He looked tall, but it was hard
to say for certain. Aside from the hair and the eyes, he could have
been set down in any town without exciting comment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;this <em>boy</em> has proclaimed himself
the Dragon Reborn?&rdquo; Niall muttered.</p>

<p>The Dragon. The name made him feel the chills of
winter and age. The name borne by Lews Therin Telamon when he
doomed every man who could channel the One Power, then or ever
after, to insanity and death, himself among them. It was more than
three thousand years since Aes Sedai pride and the War of the
Shadow had brought an end to the Age of Legends. Three thousand
years, but prophecy and legend helped men remember&mdash;the heart
of it, at least, if the details were gone. Lews Therin Kinslayer.
The man who had begun the Breaking of the World, when madmen who
could tap the power that drove the universe leveled mountains and
sank ancient lands beneath the seas, when the whole face of the
earth had been changed and all who survived fled like beasts before
a wildfire. It had not ended until the last male Aes Sedai lay
dead, and a scattered human race could begin trying to rebuild from
the rubble&mdash;where even rubble remained. It was burned into
memory by the stories mothers told children. And prophecy said the
Dragon would be born again.</p>

<p>Niall had not really meant it for a question, but
Byar took it for one. &ldquo;Yes, my Lord Captain Commander, he has. It
is a worse madness than any false Dragon I&rsquo;ve ever heard of.
Thousands have declared for him already. Tarabon and Arad Doman are
in civil war, as well as at war with each other. There is fighting
all across Almoth Plain and Toman Head, Taraboner against Domani
against Darkfriends crying for the Dragon&mdash;or there was
fighting until winter chilled most of it. I&rsquo;ve never seen it spread
so quickly, my Lord Captain Commander. Like throwing a lantern into
a hay barn. The snow may have damped it down, but come spring, the
flames will burst out hotter than before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Niall cut him off with a raised finger. Twice already
Niall had let him tell his story through, his voice burning with
anger and hate. Parts of it Niall knew from other sources, and in
some areas he knew more than Byar, but each time he heard it, it
goaded him anew. &ldquo;Geofram Bornhald and a thousand of the Children
dead. And Aes Sedai did it. You have no doubts, Child Byar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None, my Lord Captain Commander. After a skirmish on
the way to Falme, I saw two of the Tar Valon witches. They cost us
more than fifty dead before we stuck them full of arrows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are <em>sure</em>&mdash;sure they were Aes
Sedai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ground erupted under our feet.&rdquo; Byar&rsquo;s voice was
firm and full of belief. He had little imagination, did Jaret Byar;
death was part of a soldier&rsquo;s life, however it came. &ldquo;Lightnings
struck our ranks out of a clear sky. My Lord Captain Commander,
what else could they have been?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Niall nodded grimly. There had been no male Aes Sedai
since the Breaking of the World, but the women who still claimed
that title were bad enough. They prated of their Three Oaths: to
speak no word that was not true, to make no weapon for one man to
kill another, to use the One Power as a weapon only against
Darkfriends or Shadowspawn. But now they had showed those oaths for
the lies they were. He had always known no one could want the power
they wielded except to challenge the Creator, and that meant to
serve the Dark One.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you know nothing of those who took Falme and
killed half of one of my legions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord Captain Bornhald said they called themselves
Seanchan, my Lord Captain Commander,&rdquo; Byar said stolidly. &ldquo;He said
they were Darkfriends. And his charge broke them, even if they
killed him.&rdquo; His voice gained intensity. &ldquo;There were many refugees
from the city. Everyone I spoke to agreed the strangers had broken
and fled. Lord Captain Bornhald did that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Niall sighed softly. They were almost the same words
Byar had used the first two times about the army that had seemingly
come out of nowhere to take Falme. <em>A good soldier</em>, Niall
thought, <em>so Geofram Bornhald always said, but not a man to
think for himself</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord Captain Commander,&rdquo; Byar said suddenly,
&ldquo;Lord Captain Bornhald <em>did</em> command me to stand aside from
the battle. I was to watch, and report to you. And tell his son,
Lord Dain, how he died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; Niall said impatiently. For a moment he
studied Byar&rsquo;s hollow-cheeked face, then added, &ldquo;No one doubts your
honesty or courage. It is exactly the sort of thing Geofram
Bornhald would do, facing a battle in which he feared his entire
command might die.&rdquo; <em>And not the sort of thing you have
imagination enough to think up</em>.</p>

<p>There was nothing more to learn from the man. &ldquo;You
have done well, Child Byar. You have my leave to carry word of
Geofram Bornhald&rsquo;s death to his son. Dain Bornhald is with Eamon
Valda&mdash;near Tar Valon at last report. You may join them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, my Lord Captain Commander. Thank you.&rdquo;
Byar rose to his feet and bowed deeply. Yet as he straightened, he
hesitated. &ldquo;My Lord Captain Commander, we <em>were</em> betrayed.&rdquo;
Hatred gave his voice a saw-toothed edge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By this one Darkfriend you spoke of, Child Byar?&rdquo; He
could not keep an edge out of his own voice. A year&rsquo;s planning lay
in ruins amid the corpses of a thousand of the Children, and Byar
wanted to talk only of this one man. &ldquo;This young blacksmith you&rsquo;ve
only seen twice, this Perrin from the Two Rivers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my Lord Captain Commander. I do not know how,
but I know he is to blame. I know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will see what can be done about him, Child Byar.&rdquo;
Byar opened his mouth again, but Niall raised a thin hand to
forestall him. &ldquo;You may leave me now.&rdquo; The gaunt-faced man had no
choice but to bow again and leave.</p>

<p>As the door closed behind him, Niall lowered himself
into his high-backed chair. What had brought on Byar&rsquo;s hatred of
this Perrin? There were far too many Darkfriends to waste energy on
hating any particular one. Too many Darkfriends, high and low,
hiding behind glib tongues and open smiles, serving the Dark One.
Still, one more name added to the lists would do no harm.</p>

<p>He shifted on the hard chair, trying to find comfort
for his old bones. Not for the first time he thought vaguely that
perhaps a cushion would not be too much luxury. And not for the
first time, he pushed the thought away. The world tumbled toward
chaos, and he had no time to give in to age.</p>

<p>He let all the signs that foretold disaster swirl
through his mind. War gripped Tarabon and Arad Doman, civil war
ripped at Cairhien, and war fever was rising in Tear and Illian,
old enemies as they were. Perhaps these wars meant nothing in
themselves&mdash;men fought wars&mdash;but they usually came one
at a time. And aside from the false Dragon somewhere on Almoth
Plain, another tore at Saldaea, and a third plagued Tear. Three at
once. <em>They must all be false Dragons. They</em> must <em>
be!</em></p>

<p>A dozen small things besides, some perhaps only
baseless rumors, but taken together with the rest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Sightings
of Aiel reported as far west as Murandy, and Kandor. Only two or
three in one place, but one or a thousand, Aiel had come out of the
Waste just once in all the years since the Breaking. Only in the
Aiel War had they ever left that desolate wilderness. The Atha&rsquo;an
Miere, the Sea Folk, were said to be ignoring trade to seek signs
and portents&mdash;of what, exactly, they did not say&mdash;sailing with ships half full or even empty. Illian had called the
Great Hunt of the Horn for the first time in almost four hundred
years, had sent out the Hunters to seek the fabled Horn of Valere,
which prophecy said would summon dead heroes from the grave to
fight in Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don, the Last Battle against the Shadow. Rumor
said the Ogier, always so reclusive that most common people thought
them only legend, had called meetings between their far-flung <em>
stedding</em>.</p>

<p>Most telling of all, to Niall, the Aes Sedai had
apparently come into the open. It was said they had sent some of
their sisters to Saldaea to confront the false Dragon Mazrim Taim.
Rare as it was in men, Taim could channel the One Power. That was a
thing to fear and despise in itself, and few thought a man like
that could be defeated except with the aid of Aes Sedai. Better to
allow Aes Sedai help than to face the inevitable horrors when he
went mad, as such men inevitably did. But Tar Valon had apparently
sent other Aes Sedai to support the other false Dragon at Falme.
Nothing else fit the facts.</p>

<p>The pattern chilled the marrow in his bones. Chaos
multiplied; what was unheard of, happening again and again. The
whole world seemed to be milling, stirring near the boil. It was
clear to him. The Last Battle really was coming.</p>

<p>All his plans were destroyed, the plans that would
have secured his name among the Children of the Light for a hundred
generations. But turmoil meant opportunity, and he had new plans,
with new objectives. If he could keep the strength and will to
carry them out. <em>Light, let me hold on to life long
enough</em>.</p>

<p>A deferential tap on the door brought him out of his
dark thoughts. &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he snapped.</p>

<p>A servant in coat and breeches of white-and-gold
bowed his way in. Eyes to the floor, he announced that Jaichim
Carridin, Anointed of the Light, Inquisitor of the Hand of the
Light, came at the command of the Lord Captain Commander. Carridin
appeared on the man&rsquo;s heels, not waiting for Niall to speak. Niall
gestured the servant to leave.</p>

<p>Before the door was fully closed again, Carridin
dropped to one knee with a flourish of his snowy cloak. Behind the
sunburst on the cloak&rsquo;s breast lay the scarlet shepherd&rsquo;s crook of
the Hand of the Light, called the Questioners by many, though
seldom to their faces. &ldquo;As you have commanded my presence, my Lord
Captain Commander,&rdquo; he said in a strong voice, &ldquo;so have I returned
from Tarabon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Niall examined him for a moment. Carridin was tall,
well into his middle years, with a touch of gray in his hair, yet
fit and hard. His dark, deep-set eyes had a knowing look about
them, as always. And he did not blink under the silent study of the
Lord Captain Commander. Few men had consciences so clear or nerves
so steady. Carridin knelt there, waiting as calmly as if it were an
everyday matter to be ordered curtly to leave his command and
return to Amador without delay, no reasons given. But then, it was
said Jaichim Carridin could outwait a stone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rise, Child Carridin.&rdquo; As the other man
straightened, Niall added, &ldquo;I have had disturbing news from
Falme.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carridin straightened the folds of his cloak as he
answered. His voice rode the edge of suitable respect, almost as if
he spoke to an equal rather than to the man he had sworn to obey to
the death. &ldquo;My Lord Captain Commander refers to the news brought by
Child Jaret Byar, late second to Lord Captain Bornhald.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The corner of Niall&rsquo;s left eye fluttered, an old
presage of anger. Supposedly only three men knew Byar was in
Amador, and none besides Niall knew from where he came. &ldquo;Do not be
too clever, Carridin. Your desire to know everything may one day
lead you into the hands of your own Questioners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carridin showed no reaction beyond a slight
tightening of his mouth at the name. &ldquo;My Lord Captain Commander,
the Hand seeks out truth everywhere, to serve the Light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To serve the Light. Not to serve the Children of the
Light. All the Children served the Light, but Pedron Niall often
wondered if the Questioners really considered themselves part of
the Children at all. &ldquo;And what truth do you have for me about what
occurred in Falme?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Darkfriends, my Lord Captain Commander.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Darkfriends?&rdquo; Niall&rsquo;s chuckle held no amusement. &ldquo;A
few weeks gone I was receiving reports from you that Geofram
Bornhald was a servant of the Dark One because he moved soldiers
onto Toman Head against your orders.&rdquo; His voice became dangerously
soft. &ldquo;Do you now mean me to believe that Bornhald, as a
Darkfriend, led a thousand of the Children to their deaths fighting
other Darkfriends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whether or not he was a Darkfriend will never be
known,&rdquo; Carridin said blandly, &ldquo;since he died before he could be
put to the question. The Shadow&rsquo;s plots are murky, and often seem
mad to those who walk in the Light. But that those who seized Falme
were Darkfriends, I have no doubt. Darkfriends and Aes Sedai, in
support of a false Dragon. It was the One Power that destroyed
Bornhald and his men, of that I am sure, my Lord Captain Commander,
just as it destroyed the armies that Tarabon and Arad Doman sent
against the Darkfriends in Falme.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what of the stories that those who took Falme
came from across the Aryth Ocean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carridin shook his head. &ldquo;My Lord Captain Commander,
the people are full of rumors. Some claim they were the armies
Artur Hawkwing sent across the ocean a thousand years ago, come
back to claim the land. Why, some even claim to have seen Hawkwing
himself in Falme. And half the heroes of legend besides. The west
is boiling from Tarabon to Saldaea, and a hundred new rumors bubble
to the surface every day, each more outrageous than the last. These
so-called Seanchan were no more than another rabble of Darkfriends
gathered to support a false Dragon, only this time with open Aes
Sedai support.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What proof have you?&rdquo; Niall made his voice sound as
if he doubted the point. &ldquo;You have prisoners?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my Lord Captain Commander. As Child Byar no
doubt told you, Bornhald managed to hurt them badly enough that
they dispersed. And certainly no one we&rsquo;ve questioned would admit
to supporting a false Dragon. As for proof&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;it lies in two
parts. If my Lord Captain Commander will permit me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Niall gestured impatiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first part is negative. Few ships have tried to
cross the Aryth Ocean, and most never returned. Those that did,
turned back before they ran out of food and water. Even the Sea
Folk will not cross the Aryth, and they sail wherever there is
trade, even to the lands beyond the Aiel Waste. My Lord Captain
Commander, if there are any lands across the ocean, they are too
far to reach, the ocean too wide. To carry an army across it would
be as impossible as flying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Niall said slowly. &ldquo;It is certainly
indicative. What is your second part?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord Captain Commander, many of those we
questioned spoke of monsters fighting for the Darkfriends, and held
to their claims even under the last degree of the question. What
could they be but Trollocs and other Shadowspawn, in some way
brought down from the Blight?&rdquo; Carridin spread his hands as if that
were conclusive. &ldquo;Most people think Trollocs are only travelers&rsquo;
tales and lies, and most of the rest think they were all killed in
the Trolloc Wars. What other name would they put to a Trolloc but
monster?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Yes, you may be right, Child Carridin. May be,
I say.&rdquo; He would not give Carridin the satisfaction of knowing he
agreed. <em>Let him work awhile</em>. &ldquo;But what of him?&rdquo; He
indicated the rolled drawings. If he knew Carridin, the Inquisitor
had copies in his own chambers. &ldquo;How dangerous is he? Can he
channel the One Power?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Inquisitor merely shrugged. &ldquo;Perhaps he can
channel, perhaps not. Aes Sedai could no doubt make people believe
a cat could channel, if they wanted to. As to how dangerous he is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Any false Dragon is dangerous until he is put down, and one
with Tar Valon openly behind him is ten times dangerous. But he is
less dangerous now than he will be in half a year, unchecked. The
captives I questioned had never seen him, had no idea where he is
now. His forces are fragmented. I doubt there are more than two
hundred gathered in any one place. The Taraboners or the Domani,
either one, could sweep them away if they weren&rsquo;t so busy fighting
each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even a false Dragon,&rdquo; Niall said dryly, &ldquo;is not
enough to make them forget four hundred years of squabbling over
possession of Almoth Plain. As if either of them ever had the
strength to hold it.&rdquo; Carridin&rsquo;s face did not change, and Niall
wondered how he could keep so calm. <em>You will not be calm much
longer, Questioner</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is of no import, my Lord Captain Commander.
Winter keeps them all in their camps, except for scattered
skirmishes and raids. When the weather warms enough for troops to
move&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Bornhald took only half his legion to their deaths on
Toman Head. With the other half, I will hunt this false Dragon to
his death. A corpse is not dangerous to anyone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if you face what it seems Bornhald faced? Aes
Sedai channeling the Power to kill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Their witchery doesn&rsquo;t protect them from arrows, or
a knife in the dark. They die as quickly as anyone else.&rdquo; Carridin
smiled. &ldquo;I promise you, I will be successful before summer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Niall nodded. The man was confident, now. Sure the
dangerous questions would already have come, if they were coming.
<em>You should have remembered, Carridin, I was accounted a fine
tactician</em>. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;did you not take your own
forces to Falme? With Darkfriends on Toman Head, an army of them
holding Falme, why did you try to stop Bornhald?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carridin blinked, but his voice remained steady. &ldquo;At
first they were only rumors, my Lord Captain Commander. Rumors so
wild, no one could believe. By the time I learned the truth,
Bornhald had joined battle. He was dead, and the Darkfriends
scattered. Besides, my task was to bring the Light to Almoth Plain.
I could not disobey my orders to chase after rumors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your task?&rdquo; Niall said, his voice rising as he
stood. Carridin topped him by a head, but the Inquisitor stepped
back. &ldquo;Your task? Your task was to seize Almoth Plain! An empty
bucket that no one holds except by words and claims, and all you
had to do was fill it. The nation of Almoth would have lived again,
ruled by the Children of the Light, with no need to pay lip service
to a fool of a king. Amadicia and Almoth, a vise gripping Tarabon.
In five years we would have held sway there as much as here in
Amadicia. And you made a dog&rsquo;s dinner of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The smile went at last. &ldquo;My Lord Captain Commander,&rdquo;
Carridin protested. &ldquo;How could I foresee what happened? Yet another
false Dragon. Tarabon and Arad Doman finally going to war after so
long merely growling at each other. And Aes Sedai revealing their
true selves after three thousand years of dissembling! Even with
that, though, all is not lost. I can find and destroy this false
Dragon before his followers unite. And once the Taraboners and
Domani have weakened themselves, they can be cleared from the plain
without&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Niall snapped. &ldquo;Your plans are done with,
Carridin. Perhaps I should hand you over to your own Questioners
right now. The High Inquisitor would not object. He is gnashing his
teeth to find someone to blame for what happened. He would never
put forward one of his own, but I doubt he&rsquo;d quibble if I named
you. A few days under the question, and you would confess to
anything. Name yourself Darkfriend, even. You would go under the
headsman&rsquo;s axe inside a week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was sweat beading on Carridin&rsquo;s forehead. &ldquo;My
Lord Captain Commander&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He stopped to swallow. &ldquo;My Lord
Captain Commander seems to be saying there is another way. If he
will but speak it, I am sworn to obey.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Now</em>, Niall thought. <em>Now to toss the
dice</em>. Prickles ran across his skin, as if he were in battle
and had suddenly realized that every man for a hundred paces around
him was an enemy. Lord Captain Commanders did not go to the
headsman, but more than one had been known to die suddenly and
unexpectedly, swiftly mourned and swiftly replaced by men with less
dangerous ideas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Child Carridin,&rdquo; he said firmly, &ldquo;you will make
certain that this false Dragon does not die. And if any Aes Sedai
come to oppose rather than support him, you will make use of your
&lsquo;knives in the dark.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Inquisitor&rsquo;s jaw dropped. Yet he recovered
quickly, eyeing Niall in a speculative fashion. &ldquo;To kill Aes Sedai
is a duty, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;To allow a false Dragon to roam free? That&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that would be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;treason. And blasphemy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Niall drew a deep breath. He could sense the unseen
knives waiting in the shadows. But he was committed, now. &ldquo;It is no
treason to do what must be done. And even blasphemy can be
tolerated for a cause.&rdquo; Those two sentences alone were enough to
kill him. &ldquo;Do you know how to unite people behind you, Child
Carridin? The quickest way? No? Loose a lion&mdash;a rabid lion&mdash;in the streets. And when panic grips the people, once it has
turned their bowels to water, calmly tell them you will deal with
it. Then you kill it, and order them to hang the carcass up where
everyone can see. Before they have time to think, you give another
order, and it will be obeyed. And if you continue to give orders,
they will continue to obey, for you will be the one who saved them,
and who better to lead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carridin moved his head uncertainly. &ldquo;Do you mean to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;take it all, my Lord Captain Commander? Not just Almoth
Plain, but Tarabon and Arad Doman as well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I mean is for me to know. It is for you to obey
as you are sworn to do. I expect to hear of messengers on fast
horses leaving for the plain by tonight. I am certain you know how
to word the orders so no one suspects what they should not. If you
must harry someone, let it be the Taraboners and Domani. It would
not do to have them kill my lion. No, under the Light, we shall
force peace between them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As my Lord Captain Commander commands,&rdquo; Carridin
said smoothly. &ldquo;I hear and obey.&rdquo; Too smoothly.</p>

<p>Niall smiled a cold smile. &ldquo;In case your oath is not
strong enough, know this. If this false Dragon dies before I
command his death, or if he is taken by the Tar Valon witches, you
will be found one morning with a dagger in your heart. And should
any&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;accident&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;befall me&mdash;even if I should die of
old age&mdash;you will not survive me the month.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord Captain Commander, I have sworn to obey&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you have,&rdquo; Niall cut him off. &ldquo;See that you
remember it. Now, go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As my Lord Captain Commander commands.&rdquo; This time
Carridin&rsquo;s voice was not so steady.</p>

<p>The door closed behind the Inquisitor. Niall rubbed
his hands together. He felt cold. The dice were spinning, with no
way of telling what pips would show when they stopped. The Last
Battle truly was coming. Not the Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don of legend, with the
Dark One breaking free to be faced by the Dragon Reborn. Not that,
he was sure. The Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends might have made a
hole in the Dark One&rsquo;s prison at Shayol Ghul, but Lews Therin
Kinslayer and his Hundred Companions had sealed it up again. The
counterstroke had tainted the male half of the True Source forever
and driven them mad, and so begun the Breaking, but one of those
ancient Aes Sedai could do what ten of the Tar Valon witches of
today could not. The seals they had made would hold.</p>

<p>Pedron Niall was a man of cold logic, and he had
reasoned out how Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don would be. Bestial Trolloc hordes
rolling south out of the Great Blight as they had in the Trolloc
Wars, two thousand years before, with the Myrddraal&mdash;the
Halfmen&mdash;leading, and perhaps even new human Dreadlords from among
the Darkfriends. Humankind, split into nations squabbling among
themselves, could not stand against that. But he, Pedron Niall,
would unite humankind behind the banners of the Children of the
Light. There would be new legends, to tell how Pedron Niall had
fought Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don, and won.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;loose a rabid lion in the
streets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A rabid lion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Niall spun on his heel as a bony little man with a
huge beak of a nose slipped from behind one of the hanging banners.
There was just a glimpse of a panel swinging shut as the banner
fell back against the wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I showed you that passage, Ordeith,&rdquo; Niall snapped,
&ldquo;so you could come when I summoned you without half the fortress
knowing, not so you could listen to my private conversation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ordeith made a smooth bow as he crossed the room.
&ldquo;Listen, Great Lord? I would never do such a thing. I only just
arrived and could not avoid hearing your final words. No more than
that.&rdquo; He wore a half-mocking smile, but it never left his face
that Niall had ever seen, even when the fellow had no reason to
know anyone was watching.</p>

<p>A month before, in the dead of winter, the gangly
little man had arrived in Amadicia, ragged and half-frozen, and
somehow managed to talk his way through all the layers of guards to
Pedron Niall himself. He seemed to know things about events on
Toman Head that were not in Carridin&rsquo;s voluminous if obscure
reports, or in Byar&rsquo;s tale, or in any other report or rumor that
had come to Niall. His name was a lie, of course. In the Old
Tongue, Ordeith meant &ldquo;wormwood.&rdquo; When Niall challenged him on it,
though, all he said was, &ldquo;Who we were is lost to all men, and life
is bitter.&rdquo; But he was clever. It had been he who helped Niall see
the pattern emerging in events.</p>

<p>Ordeith moved to the table and took up one of the
drawings. As he unrolled it enough to reveal the young man&rsquo;s face,
his smile deepened to nearly a grimace.</p>

<p>Niall was still irritated that the man had come
unsummoned. &ldquo;You find a false Dragon funny, Ordeith. Or does he
frighten you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A false Dragon?&rdquo; Ordeith said softly. &ldquo;Yes. Yes, of
course, it must be. Who else could it be.&rdquo; And he barked a shrill
laugh that grated on Niall&rsquo;s nerves. Sometimes Niall thought
Ordeith was at least half-mad.</p>

<p><em>But he is clever, mad or not</em>. &ldquo;What do you
mean, Ordeith? You sound as if you know him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ordeith gave a start, as though he had forgotten the
Lord Captain Commander was there. &ldquo;Know him? Oh, yes, I know him.
His name is Rand al&rsquo;Thor. He comes from the Two Rivers, in the
backcountry of Andor, and he is a Darkfriend so deep in the Shadow
it would make your soul cringe to know the half.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Two Rivers,&rdquo; Niall mused. &ldquo;Someone else
mentioned another Darkfriend from there, another youth. Strange to
think of Darkfriends coming from a place like that. But truly they
are everywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another, Great Lord?&rdquo; Ordeith said. &ldquo;From the Two
Rivers? Would that be Matrim Cauthon or Perrin Aybara? They are of
an age with him, and close behind in evil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His name was given as Perrin,&rdquo; Niall said, frowning.
&ldquo;Three of them, you say? Nothing comes out of the Two Rivers but
wool and tabac. I doubt if there is another place men live that is
more isolated from the rest of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a city, Darkfriends must hide their nature to one
extent or another. They must associate with others, with strangers
come from other places and leaving to take word of what they have
seen. But in quiet villages, cut off from the world, where few
outsiders ever go&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;What better places for all to be
Darkfriends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is it you know the names of three Darkfriends,
Ordeith? Three Darkfriends from the far end of forever. You keep
too many secrets, Wormwood, and pull more surprises from your
sleeve than a gleeman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can any man tell <em>all</em> that he knows,
Great Lord,&rdquo; the little man said smoothly. &ldquo;It would be only
prattle, until it becomes useful. I will tell you this, Great Lord.
This Rand al&rsquo;Thor, this Dragon, has deep roots in the Two
Rivers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;False Dragon!&rdquo; Niall said sharply, and the other man
bowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, Great Lord. I misspoke myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly Niall became aware of the drawing crumpled
and torn in Ordeith&rsquo;s hands. Even while the man&rsquo;s face remained
smooth except for that sardonic smile, his hands twitched
convulsively around the parchment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop that!&rdquo; Niall commanded. He snatched the drawing
away from Ordeith and smoothed it as best he could. &ldquo;I do not have
so many likenesses of this man that I can allow them to be
destroyed.&rdquo; Much of the drawing was only a smudge, and a rip ran
across the young man&rsquo;s breast, but miraculously the face was
untouched.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, Great Lord.&rdquo; Ordeith made a deep bow,
his smile never slipping. &ldquo;I hate Darkfriends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Niall studied the face in chalks. <em>Rand al&rsquo;Thor,
of the Two Rivers</em>. &ldquo;Perhaps I must make plans for the Two
Rivers. When the snows clear. Perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the Great Lord wishes,&rdquo; Ordeith said blandly.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The grimace on Carridin&rsquo;s face as he strode through
the halls of the Fortress made other men avoid him, though in truth
few sought the company of Questioners. Servants, hurrying about
their tasks, tried to fade into the stone walls, and even men with
golden knots of rank on their white cloaks took side corridors when
they saw his face.</p>

<p>He flung open the door to his rooms and slammed it
behind him, feeling none of the usual satisfaction at the fine
carpets from Tarabon and Tear in lush reds and golds and blues, the
beveled mirrors from Illian, the gold-leaf work on the long,
intricately carved table in the middle of the floor. A master
craftsman from Lugard had worked nearly a year on that. This time
he barely saw it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sharbon!&rdquo; For once his body servant did not appear.
The man was supposed to be readying the rooms. &ldquo;The Light burn you,
Sharbon! Where are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A movement caught the corner of his eye, and he
turned ready to shrivel Sharbon with his curses. The curses
themselves shriveled as a Myrddraal took another step toward him
with the sinuous grace of a serpent.</p>

<p>It was a man in form, no larger than most, but there
the resemblance ended. Dead black clothes and cloak, hardly seeming
to stir as it moved, made its maggot-white skin appear ever paler.
And it had no eyes. That eyeless gaze filled Carridin with fear, as
it had filled thousands before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wha&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Carridin stopped to work moisture back
into his mouth, to try bringing his voice back down to its normal
register. &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; It still sounded shrill.</p>

<p>The Halfman&rsquo;s bloodless lips quirked in a smile.
&ldquo;Where there is shadow, there may I go.&rdquo; Its voice sounded like a
snake rustling through dead leaves. &ldquo;I like to keep a watch on all
those who serve me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ser&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was no use. With an effort Carridin jerked his
eyes away from that smooth expanse of pale, pasty face and turned
his back. A shiver ran down his spine, having his back to a
Myrddraal. Everything was sharp in the mirror on the wall in front
of him. Everything but the Halfman. The Myrddraal was an indistinct
blur. Hardly soothing to look at, but better than meeting that
stare. A little strength returned to Carridin&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I serve the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He cut off, suddenly aware of
where he was. In the heart of the Fortress of the Light. The rumor
of a whisper of the words he was about to say would have him given
to the Hand of the Light. The lowest of the Children would strike
him down on the spot if he heard. He was alone except for the
Myrddraal, and perhaps Sharbon&mdash;<em>Where is that cursed
man?</em> It would be good to have someone to share the Halfman&rsquo;s
stare, even if the other would have to be disposed of afterwards&mdash;but still he lowered his voice. &ldquo;I serve the Great Lord of
the Dark, as you do. We both serve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you wish to see it so.&rdquo; The Myrddraal laughed, a
sound that made Carridin&rsquo;s bones shiver. &ldquo;Still, I will know why
you are here instead of on Almoth Plain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was commanded here by word of the Lord Captain
Commander.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Myrddraal grated, &ldquo;Your Lord Captain Commander&rsquo;s
words are dung! You were commanded to find the human called Rand
al&rsquo;Thor and kill him. That before all else. Above all else! Why are
you not obeying?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carridin took a deep breath. That gaze on his back
felt like a knife blade grating along his spine. &ldquo;Things&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;have
changed. Some matters are not as much in my control as they were.&rdquo;
A harsh, scraping noise jerked his head around.</p>

<p>The Myrddraal was drawing a hand across the tabletop,
and thin tendrils of wood curled away from its fingernails.
&ldquo;Nothing has changed, human. You foreswore your oaths to the Light
and swore new oaths, and <em>those</em> oaths you will obey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carridin started at the gouges marring the polished
wood and swallowed hard. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand. Why is it suddenly so
important to kill him? I thought the Great Lord of the Dark meant
to use him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You question me? I should take your tongue. It is
not your part to question. Or to understand. It is your part to
obey! You will give dogs lessons in obedience. Do you understand
<em>that</em>? Heel, dog, and obey your master.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anger wormed its way through the fear, and Carridin&rsquo;s
hand groped at his side, but his sword was not there. It lay in the
next room now, where he had left it on going to attend Pedron
Niall.</p>

<p>The Myrddraal moved faster than a striking viper.
Carridin opened his mouth to scream as its hand closed on his wrist
in a crushing grip; bones grated together, sending jolts of agony
up his arm. The scream never left his mouth, though, for the
Halfman&rsquo;s other hand gripped his chin and forced his jaws shut. His
heels rose up, and then his toes left the floor. Grunting and
gurgling, he dangled in the Myrddraal&rsquo;s grasp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear me, human. You will find this youth and kill
him as quickly as possible. Do not think you can dissemble. There
are others of your <em>children</em> who will tell me if you turn
aside in your purpose. But I will give you this to encourage you.
If this Rand al&rsquo;Thor is not dead in a month, I will take one of
your blood. A son, a daughter, a sister, an uncle. You will not
know who until the chosen has died screaming. If he lives another
month, I will take another. And then another, and another. And when
there is no one of your blood living except yourself, if he still
lives, I will take you to Shayol Ghul itself.&rdquo; It smiled. &ldquo;You will
be years in the dying, human. Do you understand me, now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carridin made a sound, half groan, half whimper. He
thought his neck was going to break.</p>

<p>With a snarl, the Myrddraal hurled him across the
room. Carridin slammed against the far wall and slid to the rug,
stunned. Facedown, he lay fighting for breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you understand me, human?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I hear and obey,&rdquo; Carridin managed into the
carpet. There was no answer.</p>

<p>He turned his head, wincing at the pain in his neck.
The room was empty except for him. Halfmen rode shadows like
horses, so the legends said, and when they turned sideways, they
disappeared. No wall could keep them out. Carridin wanted to weep.
He levered himself up, cursing the jolt of pain from his wrist.</p>

<p>The door opened, and Sharbon hurried in, a plump man
with a basket in his arms. He stopped to stare at Carridin.
&ldquo;Master, are you all right? Forgive me for not being here, master,
but I went to buy fruits for your&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>With his good hand Carridin struck the basket from
Sharbon&rsquo;s hands, sending withered winter apples rolling across the
carpets, and backhanded the man across the face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, master,&rdquo; Sharbon whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fetch me paper and pen and ink,&rdquo; Carridin snarled.
&ldquo;Hurry, fool! I must send orders.&rdquo; <em>But which? Which?</em> As
Sharbon scurried to obey, Carridin stared at the gouges in the
tabletop and shivered.</p>
