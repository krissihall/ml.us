<h4><em>Following the Craft</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">A</span>s
the <em>Darter</em> wallowed toward the docks of
Tear, on the west bank of the River Erinin, Egwene did not see
anything of the oncoming city. Slumped head down at the rail, she
stared down at the waters of the Erinin rolling past the ship&rsquo;s fat
hull, and the frontmost sweep on her side as it swung into her
vision and back again, cutting white furrows in the river. It made
her queasy, but she knew raising her head would only make the
sickness worse. Looking at the shore would only make the slow,
corkscrew motion of the <em>Darter</em> more apparent.</p>

<p>The vessel had moved in that twisting roll ever since
Jurene. She did not care how it had sailed before then; she found
herself wishing the <em>Darter</em> had sunk before reaching
Jurene. She wished they had made the captain put in at Aringill so
they could find another ship. She wished they had never gone near a
ship. She wished a great many things, most of them just to take her
mind off where she was.</p>

<p>The twisting was less now, under sweeps, than it had
been under sail, but it had gone on too many days now for the
change to make much difference to her. Her stomach seemed to be
sloshing about inside her like milk in a stone jug. She gulped and
tried to forget that image.</p>

<p>They had not done much in the way of planning on the
<em>Darter</em>, she and Elayne and Nynaeve. Nynaeve could seldom
go ten minutes without vomiting, and seeing that always made Egwene
lose whatever food she had managed to get down. The increasing
warmth as they went further downriver did not help. Nynaeve was
below now, no doubt with Elayne holding a basin for her again.</p>

<p><em>Oh, Light, no! Don&rsquo;t think about that! Green
fields. Meadows. Light, meadow, do not heave like that.
Hummingbirds. No, not hummingbirds! Larks. Larks singing</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mistress Joslyn? Mistress Joslyn!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It took her a moment to recognize the name she had
chosen to give Captain Canin, and the captain&rsquo;s voice. She raised
her head slowly and fixed her eyes on his long face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are docking, Mistress Joslyn. You&rsquo;ve kept saying
how eager you were to be ashore. Well, we&rsquo;re there.&rdquo; His voice did
not hide his eagerness to be rid of his three passengers, two of
whom did little more than sick up, as he called it, and moan all
night.</p>

<p>Barefoot, shirtless sailors were tossing lines to men
on the stone dock that thrust out into the river; the dockmen
seemed to be wearing long leather vests in place of shirts. The
sweeps had already been drawn in, except for a pair fending the
ship off from coming against the dock too hard. The flat stones of
the dock were wet; the air had a feel of rain not long gone, and
that was a little soothing. The twisting motion had ceased some
time since, she realized, but her stomach remembered. The sun was
falling toward the west. She tried not to think of supper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good, Captain Canin,&rdquo; she said with all the
dignity she could summon. <em>He&rsquo;d not sound like that if I were
wearing my ring, not even if I were sick on his boots</em>. She
shuddered at the picture in her mind.</p>

<p>Her Great Serpent ring and the twisted ring of the
<em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> hung on a leather cord about her neck, now.
The stone ring felt cool against her skin&mdash;almost enough to
counteract the damp warmth of the air&mdash;but aside from that,
she had found that the more she used the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, the
more she wanted to touch it, without pouch or cloth between it and
her.</p>

<p><em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> still showed her little of
immediate use. Sometimes there had been glimpses of Rand, or Mat,
or Perrin, and more in her own dreams without the <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, but nothing of which she could make any sense.
The Seanchan, who she refused to think about. Nightmares of a
Whitecloak putting Master Luhhan in the middle of a huge, toothed
trap for bait. Why should Perrin have a falcon on his shoulder, and
what was important about him choosing between that axe he wore now
and a blacksmith&rsquo;s hammer? What did it mean that Mat was dicing
with the Dark One, and why did he keep shouting, &ldquo;I am coming!&rdquo; and
why did she think in the dream that he was shouting at her? And
Rand. He had been sneaking through utter darkness toward <em>
Callandor</em>, while all around him six men and five women walked,
some hunting him and some ignoring him, some trying to guide him
toward the shining crystal sword and some trying to stop him from
reaching it, appearing not to know where he was, or only to see him
in flashes. One of the men had eyes of flame, and he wanted Rand
dead with a desperation she could nearly taste. She thought she
knew him. Ba&rsquo;alzamon. But who were the others? Rand in that dry,
dusty chamber again, with those small creatures settling into his
skin. Rand confronting a horde of Seanchan. Rand confronting her,
and the women with her, and one of <em>them</em> was a Seanchan. It
was all too confusing. She had to stop thinking about Rand and the
others and put her mind to what was right ahead of her. <em>What is
the Black Ajah up to? Why don&rsquo;t I dream something about them?
Light, why can&rsquo;t I learn to make it do what I want?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Have the horses put ashore, Captain,&rdquo; she told
Canin. &ldquo;I will tell Mistress Maryim and Mistress Caryla.&rdquo; That was
Nynaeve&mdash;Maryim&mdash;and Elayne&mdash;Caryla.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have sent a man to tell them, Mistress Joslyn. And
your animals will be on the dock as soon as my men can rig a
boom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sounded very pleased to be rid of them. She
thought about telling him not to hurry, but rejected it
immediately. The <em>Darter</em>&rsquo;s corkscrewing might have stopped,
but she wanted dry land under her feet again. Now. Still, she
stopped to pat Mist&rsquo;s nose and let the gray mare nuzzle her palm,
to let Canin see she was in no great rush.</p>

<p>Nynaeve and Elayne appeared at the ladder from the
cabins, laden with their bundles and saddlebags, and Elayne almost
as laden with Nynaeve. When Nynaeve saw Egwene watching, she pushed
herself away from the Daughter-Heir and walked unaided the rest of
the way to where men were setting a narrow gangplank to the dock.
Two crewmen came to fasten a wide canvas sling under Mist&rsquo;s belly,
and Egwene hurried below for her own things. When she came back up,
her mare was already on the dock and Elayne&rsquo;s roan dangled in the
canvas sling halfway there.</p>

<p>For a moment after her feet were on the dock, all she
felt was relief. This would not pitch and roll. Then she began to
look at this city whose reaching had caused them such pains.</p>

<p>Stone warehouses backed the long docks themselves,
and there seemed to be a great many ships, large and small,
alongside the docks or anchored in the river. Hastily she avoided
looking at the ships. Tear had been built on flat land, with barely
a bump. Down muddy dirt streets between the warehouses, she could
see houses and inns and taverns of wood and stone. Their roofs of
slate or tile had oddly sharp corners, and some rose to a point.
Beyond these, she could make out a high wall of dark gray stone,
and behind it the tops of towers with balconies high around them
and white-domed palaces. The domes had a squared shape to them, and
the tower tops looked pointed, like some of the roofs outside the
wall. All in all, Tear was easily as big as Caemlyn or Tar Valon,
and if not so beautiful as either, it was still one of the great
cities. Yet she found it hard to look at anything but the Stone of
Tear.</p>

<p>She had heard of it in stories, heard that it was the
greatest fortress in the world and the oldest, the first built
after the Breaking of the World, yet nothing had prepared her for
this sight. At first she thought it was a huge, gray stone hill or
a small, barren mountain covering hundreds of hides, its length
stretching from the Erinin west through the wall and into the city.
Even after she saw the huge banner flapping from its greatest
height&mdash;three white crescent moons slanting across a field
half red, half gold; a banner waving at least three hundred paces
above the river, yet large enough to be clearly seen at that height&mdash;even after she made out battlements and towers, it was
difficult to believe the Stone of Tear had been built rather than
carved out of a mountain already there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Made with the Power,&rdquo; Elayne murmured. She was
staring at the Stone, too. &ldquo;Flows of Earth woven to draw stone from
the ground, Air to bring it from every corner of the world, and
Earth and Fire to make it all in one piece, without seam or joint
or mortar. Atuan Sedai says the Tower could not do it, today.
Strange, given how the High Lords feel concerning the Power
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; Nynaeve said softly, eyeing the dockmen
moving around them, &ldquo;that given that very thing, we should not
mention certain other things aloud.&rdquo; Elayne appeared torn between
indignation&mdash;she had spoken very softly&mdash;and agreement;
the Daughter-Heir agreed with Nynaeve too often and too readily to
suit Egwene.</p>

<p><em>Only when Nynaeve is right</em>, she admitted to
herself grudgingly. A woman who wore the ring, or was even
associated with Tar Valon, would be watched here. The barefoot,
leather-vested dockmen were not paying the three of them any mind
as they hurried about, carrying bales or crates on their backs as
often as on barrows. A strong odor of fish hung in the air; the
next three docks had dozens of small fishing boats clustered around
them, just like those in the drawing in the Amyrlin&rsquo;s study.
Shirtless men and barefoot women were hoisting baskets of fish out
of the boats, mounds of silver and bronze and green, and colors she
had never suspected fish might be, such as bright red, and deep
blue, and brilliant yellow, some with stripes or splotches of white
and other colors.</p>

<p>She lowered her voice for Elayne&rsquo;s ear alone. &ldquo;She is
right. Caryla. Remember why you are Caryla.&rdquo; She did not want
Nynaeve to hear such admissions. Her face did not change when she
heard, but Egwene could feel satisfaction radiating from her like
heat from a cook stove.</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s black stallion was just being lowered to
the dock; sailors had already carried their tack off the ship and
simply dumped it on the wet stones of the dock. Nynaeve glanced at
the horses and opened her mouth&mdash;Egwene was sure it was to
tell them to saddle their animals&mdash;then closed it again,
tight-lipped, as if it had cost her an effort. She gave her braid
one hard tug. Before the sling was well out of the way, Nynaeve
tossed the blue-striped saddle blanket across the black&rsquo;s back and
hoisted her high-cantled saddle atop it. She did not even look at
the other two women.</p>

<p>Egwene was not anxious to ride at that moment&mdash;the motion of a horse might be too close to the motion of the <em>
Darter</em> for her stomach&mdash;but another look at those muddy
streets convinced her. Her shoes were sturdy, but she would not
enjoy having to clean mud off them, or having to hold her skirts up
as she walked, either. She saddled Mist quickly and climbed onto
her back, settling her skirts, before she could decide the mud
might not be so bad after all. A little needlework on the <em>
Darter</em>&mdash;Elayne had done it all, this time; the
Daughter-Heir sewed a very fine stitch&mdash;had divided all their
dresses nicely for riding astride.</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s face paled for a moment when she swung into
her saddle and the stallion decided to frisk. She kept a
tight-mouthed grip on herself and a firm hand on her reins and soon
had him under control. By the time they had ridden slowly past the
warehouses, she could speak. &ldquo;We need to locate Liandrin and the
others without them learning we are asking after them. They surely
know we are coming&mdash;that someone is, at least&mdash;but I
would like them not to know we are here until it is too late for
them.&rdquo; She drew a deep breath. &ldquo;I confess I have not thought of any
way to do this. Yet. Do either of you have any suggestions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A thief-taker,&rdquo; Elayne said without hesitation.
Nynaeve frowned at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean like Hurin?&rdquo; Egwene said. &ldquo;But Hurin was in
the service of his king. Wouldn&rsquo;t any thief-taker here serve the
High Lords?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne nodded, and for a moment Egwene envied the
Daughter-Heir her stomach. &ldquo;Yes, they would. But thief-takers are
not like the Queen&rsquo;s Guards, or the Tairen Defenders of the Stone.
They serve the ruler, but people who have been robbed sometimes pay
them to retrieve what was stolen. And they also sometimes take
money to find people. At least, they do in Caemlyn. I cannot think
it is different here in Tear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we take rooms at an inn,&rdquo; Egwene said, &ldquo;and ask
the innkeeper to find us a thief-taker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not an inn,&rdquo; Nynaeve said as firmly as she guided
the stallion; she never seemed to let the animal get out of her
control. After a moment she moderated her tone a little. &ldquo;Liandrin,
at least, knows us, and we have to assume the others do, too. They
will surely be watching the inns for whoever followed the trail
they sprinkled behind them. I mean to spring their trap in their
faces, but not with us inside. We&rsquo;ll not stay at an inn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene refused to give her the satisfaction of
asking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where then?&rdquo; Elayne&rsquo;s brow furrowed. &ldquo;If I made
myself known&mdash;and could make anyone believe it, in these
clothes and with no escort&mdash;we would be welcomed by most of
the noble Houses, and very likely in the Stone itself&mdash;there
are good relations between Caemlyn and Tear&mdash;but there would
be no keeping it quiet. The entire city would know before
nightfall. I cannot think of anywhere else except an inn, Nynaeve.
Unless you mean to go out to a farm in the country, but we will
never find them from the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve glanced at Egwene. &ldquo;I will know when I see
it. Let me look.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s frown swept from Nynaeve to Egwene and back
again. &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;Do not cut off your ears because you do not like your
earrings,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; she muttered.</p>

<p>Egwene put her attention firmly on the street they
were riding along. <em>I will be burned if I&rsquo;ll let her think I am
even wondering!</em></p>

<p>There were not a great many people out, not compared
to the streets of Tar Valon. Perhaps the thick mud in the street
discouraged them. Carts and wagons lurched past, most pulled by
oxen with wide horns, the carter or wagoneer walking alongside with
a long goad of some pale, ridged wood. No carriages or sedan chairs
used these streets. The odor of fish hung in the air here, too, and
no few of the men who hurried past carried huge baskets full of
fish on their backs. The shops did not look prosperous; none
displayed wares outside, and Egwene seldom saw anyone go in. The
shops had signs&mdash;the tailor&rsquo;s needle and bolt of cloth, the
cutler&rsquo;s knife and scissors, the weaver&rsquo;s loom, and the like&mdash;but the paint on most of them was peeling. The few inns had
signs in as bad a state, and looked no busier. The small houses
crowded between inns and shops often had tiles or slates missing
from their roofs. This part of Tear, at least, was poor. And from
what she saw on the faces, few of the people here cared to try any
longer. They were moving, working, but most of them had given up.
Few as much as glanced at three women riding where everyone else
walked.</p>

<p>The men wore baggy breeches, usually tied at the
ankle. Only a handful wore coats, long, dark garments that fit arms
and chest tightly, then became looser below the waist. There were
more men in low shoes than in boots, but most went barefoot in the
mud. A good many wore no coat or shirt at all, and had their
breeches held up by a broad sash, sometimes colored and often
dirty. Some had wide, conical straw hats on their heads, and a few,
cloth caps that sagged down one side of the face. The women&rsquo;s
dresses had high necks, right up to their chins, and hems that
stopped at the ankle. Many had short aprons in pale colors,
sometimes two or three, each smaller than the one beneath it, and
most wore the same straw hats as the men, but dyed to complement
the aprons.</p>

<p>It was on a woman that she first saw how those who
wore shoes dealt with the mud. The woman had small wooden platforms
tied to the soles of her shoes, lifting them two hands out of the
mud; she walked along as if her feet were planted firmly on the
ground. Egwene saw others wearing the platforms after that, men as
well as women. Some of the women went barefoot, but not as many as
the men.</p>

<p>She was wondering which shop might sell those
platforms, when Nynaeve suddenly turned her black down an alleyway
between a long, narrow two-story house and a stone-walled potter&rsquo;s
shop. Egwene exchanged glances with Elayne&mdash;the Daughter-Heir
shrugged&mdash;and then they followed. Egwene did not know where
Nynaeve was going or why&mdash;and she meant to have words with
her about it&mdash;but she did not mean to become separated,
either.</p>

<p>The alley suddenly let into a small yard behind the
house, fenced in by the buildings around it. Nynaeve had already
dismounted and tied her reins to a fig tree, where the stallion
could not reach the green things sprouting in a vegetable patch
that took up half the yard. A line of stones had been laid to make
a path to the back door. Nynaeve strode to the door and
knocked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Egwene demanded in spite of herself.
&ldquo;Why are we stopping here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you not see the herbs in the front windows?&rdquo;
Nynaeve knocked again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Herbs?&rdquo; Elayne said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Wisdom,&rdquo; Egwene told her as she got down from her
saddle and tied Mist alongside the black. <em>Gaidin is no good
name for a horse. Does she think I don&rsquo;t know who she means it
for?</em> &ldquo;Nynaeve has found herself a Wisdom, or Seeker, or
whatever they call her here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A woman opened the door just enough to look out
suspiciously. At first Egwene thought she was stout, but then the
woman opened the door the rest of the way. She was certainly well
padded, but the way she moved spoke of muscle underneath. She
looked as strong as Mistress Luhhan, and some in Emond&rsquo;s Field
claimed Alsbet Luhhan was almost as strong as her husband. It was
not true, but it was not far wrong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can I help you?&rdquo; the woman said in an accent
like the Amyrlin&rsquo;s. Her gray hair was arranged in thick curls that
hung down the sides of her head, and her three aprons were in
shades of green, each slightly darker than the one below, but even
the topmost pale. &ldquo;Which one of you needs me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. &ldquo;I need something for a queasy
stomach. And perhaps one of my companions does, too. That is, if
we&rsquo;ve come to the right place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not Tairen,&rdquo; the woman said. &ldquo;I should have
known that by your clothes, before you spoke. I&rsquo;m called Mother
Guenna. I am called a Wise Woman, too, but I&rsquo;m old enough not to
trust that to caulk a seam. You come, and I will give you something
for your stomach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a neat kitchen, though not large, with copper
pots hanging on the wall, and dried herbs and sausages from the
ceiling. Several tall cupboards of pale wood had doors carved with
some sort of tall grass. The table had been scrubbed almost white,
and the backs of the chairs were carved with flowers. A pot of
fishy-smelling soup was simmering atop the stone stove, and a
kettle with a spout, just beginning to steam. There was no fire on
the stone hearth, for which Egwene was more than grateful; the
stove added enough to the heat, though Mother Guenna seemed not to
notice it at all. Dishes lined the mantel, and more were stacked
neatly on shelves to either side. The floor looked as if it had
just been swept.</p>

<p>Mother Guenna closed the door after them, and as she
was crossing the kitchen to her cupboards, Nynaeve said, &ldquo;Which tea
will you give me? Chainleaf? Or bluewort?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would if I had any of either.&rdquo; Mother Guenna
rooted in the shelves a moment and came out with a stone jar.
&ldquo;Since I&rsquo;ve had no time to glean of late, I will give you a brew of
marshwhite leaves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not familiar with that,&rdquo; Nynaeve said
slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It works as well as chainleaf, but it has a bite to
the taste some don&rsquo;t care for.&rdquo; The big woman sprinkled dried and
broken leaves into a blue teapot and carried it over to the
fireplace to add hot water. &ldquo;Do you follow the craft, then? Sit.&rdquo;
She gestured to the table with a hand holding two blue-glazed cups
shed had taken from the mantel. &ldquo;Sit, and we&rsquo;ll talk. Which one of
you has the other stomach?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am fine,&rdquo; Egwene said casually as she took a
chair. &ldquo;Are you queasy, Caryla?&rdquo; The Daughter-Heir shook her head
with perhaps a touch of exasperation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No matter.&rdquo; The gray-haired woman poured out a cup
of dark liquid for Nynaeve, then sat across the table from her. &ldquo;I
made enough for two, but marshwhite tea keeps longer than salted
fish. It works better the longer it sits, too, but it also grows
more bitter. Makes a race between how much you need your stomach
settled and what your tongue can stand. Drink, girl.&rdquo; After a
moment, she filled the second cup and took a sip. &ldquo;You see? It will
not hurt you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve raised her own cup, making a small sound of
displeasure at the first taste. When she lowered the cup again,
though, her face was smooth. &ldquo;It is just a little bitter perhaps.
Tell me, Mother Guenna, will we have to put up with this rain and
mud much longer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The older woman frowned, parceling displeasure among
the three of them before she settled on Nynaeve. &ldquo;I am not a Sea
Folk Windfinder, girl,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;If I could tell the
weather, I&rsquo;d sooner stick live silverpike down my dress than admit
it. The Defenders take that sort of thing for next to Aes Sedai
work. Now, do you follow the craft or not? You look as if you have
been traveling. What is good for fatigue?&rdquo; she barked suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Flatwort tea,&rdquo; Nynaeve said calmly, &ldquo;or andilay
root. Since you ask questions, what would you do to ease
birthing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mother Guenna snorted. &ldquo;Apply warm towels, child, and
perhaps give her a little whitefennel if it was an especially hard
birth. A woman needs no more than that, and a soothing hand. Can&rsquo;t
you think of a question any country farmwife could not answer? What
do you give for pains in the heart? The killing kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Powdered gheandin blossom on the tongue,&rdquo; Nynaeve
said crisply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If a woman has biting pains in her belly and spits
up blood, what do you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They settled down as if testing each other, tossing
questions and answers back and forth faster and faster. Sometimes
the questioning lagged a moment when one spoke of a plant the other
knew only by another name, but they picked up speed again, arguing
the merits of tinctures against teas, salves against poultices, and
when one was better than another. Slowly, all the quick questions
began shifting toward the herbs and roots one knew that the other
did not, digging for knowledge. Egwene began to grow irritable
listening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After you give him the boneknit,&rdquo; Mother Guenna was
saying, &ldquo;you wrap the broken limb in toweling soaked in water where
you&rsquo;ve boiled blue goatflowers&mdash;only the blue, mind!&rdquo;&mdash;Nynaeve nodded impatiently&mdash;&ldquo;and as hot as he can stand it. One
part blue goatflowers to ten of water, no weaker. Replace the
towels as soon as they stop steaming, and keep it up all day. The
bone will knit twice as fast as with boneknit alone, and twice as
strong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will remember that,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. &ldquo;You mentioned
using sheepstongue root for eye pain. I&rsquo;ve never heard&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene could stand it no longer. &ldquo;Maryim,&rdquo; she broke
in, &ldquo;do you really believe you&rsquo;ll ever need to know these things
again? You are not a Wisdom any longer, or have you forgotten?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not forgotten anything,&rdquo; Nynaeve said
sharply. &ldquo;I remember a time when you were as eager to learn new
things as I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother Guenna,&rdquo; Elayne said blandly, &ldquo;what do you do
for two women who cannot stop arguing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gray-haired woman pursed her lips and frowned at
the table. &ldquo;Usually, men or women, I tell them to stay away from
each other. That is the best thing, and the easiest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Usually?&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;What if there is a reason
they cannot stay apart. Say they are sisters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do have a way to make an arguer stop,&rdquo; the big
woman said slowly. &ldquo;It is not something I urge anyone to try, but
some do come to me.&rdquo; Egwene thought there was a suspicion of a
smile at the corners of her mouth. &ldquo;I charge a silver mark each for
women. Two for men, because men make more fuss. There are some will
buy anything, if it costs enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what is the cure?&rdquo; Elayne asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell them they have to bring the other one here
with them, the one they argue with. Both expect me to quiet the
other&rsquo;s tongue.&rdquo; Despite herself, Egwene was listening. She noticed
Nynaeve seemed to be paying sharp attention, as well. &ldquo;When they
have paid me,&rdquo; Mother Guenna continued, flexing one hefty arm, &ldquo;I
take them out back and stick their heads in my rain barrel till
they agree to stop their arguing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne burst out laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I may have done something very like that
myself,&rdquo; Nynaeve said in a voice that was much too light. Egwene
hoped her own expression looked nothing like Nynaeve&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d not be surprised if you have.&rdquo; Mother Guenna was
grinning openly now. &ldquo;I tell them the next time I hear they&rsquo;ve been
arguing, I will do it for free, but I&rsquo;ll use the river. It is
remarkable how often the cure works, for men especially. And it is
remarkable what it has done for my reputation. For some reason,
none of the people I cure this way ever tells anyone else the
details, so someone asks for the cure every few months. If you&rsquo;ve
been fool enough to eat mudfish, you do not go around telling
people. I trust none of you have any wish to spend a silver
mark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; Egwene said, and glared at Elayne when
she went off in peals of laughter again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; the gray-haired woman said. &ldquo;Those I cure of
arguing have a tendency to avoid me like stingweed caught in their
nets, unless they actually take sick, and I am enjoying your
company. Most of those who come at present want something to take
away bad dreams, and they grow sour when I have nothing to give
them.&rdquo; For a moment she slipped into a frown, rubbing her temples.
&ldquo;It is good to see three faces that do not look as if there is
nothing left but to jump over the side and drown. If you are
staying long in Tear, you must come see me again. The girl called
you Maryim? I am Ailhuin. The next time, we&rsquo;ll talk over some good
Sea Folk tea instead of something that curdles your tongue. Light,
but I hate the taste of marshwhite; mudfish would taste sweeter. In
fact, if you have time to stay now, I&rsquo;ll brew a pot of Tremalking
black. Not long till supper, either. It&rsquo;s just bread and soup and
cheese, but you are welcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be very nice, Ailhuin,&rdquo; Nynaeve said.
&ldquo;Actually&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Ailhuin, if you have a spare bedroom, I&rsquo;d like to
hire it for the three of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The big woman looked at each of them without saying
anything. Getting to her feet, she tucked the pot of marshwhite tea
away in the herb cupboard, then fetched a red teapot and a pouch
from another. Only when she had brewed a pot of Tremalking black,
put four clean cups and a bowl of honeycomb on the table along with
pewter spoons, and reclaimed her chair did she speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve three empty bedrooms upstairs, now my daughters
are all married. My husband, the Light shine on him, was lost in a
storm in the Fingers of the Dragon near twenty years ago. There
need be no talk of hiring, if I decide to let you have the rooms.
If, Maryim.&rdquo; Stirring honey into her tea, she studied them
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will make you decide?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked
quietly.</p>

<p>Ailhuin continued to stir, as if she had forgotten to
drink. &ldquo;Three young women, riding fine horses. I don&rsquo;t know much
about horses, but those look as fine as what the lords and ladies
ride, to me. You, Maryim, know enough of the craft that you ought
to have hung herbs in your window already, or should be choosing
where to do it. I&rsquo;ve never heard of a woman practicing the craft
too far from where she was born, but by your tongue, you are a long
way.&rdquo; She glanced at Elayne. &ldquo;Not many places with hair that color.
Andor, I&rsquo;d say, by your speech. Fool men are always talking about
finding a yellow-haired Andor girl. What I want to know is why?
Running away from something? Or running after something? Only, you
don&rsquo;t look like thieves to me, and I never heard of three women
chasing after a man together. So tell me why, and if I like it, the
rooms are yours. If you want to pay something, you buy a bit of
meat now and then. Meat is dear since the trade up to Cairhien fell
away. But first the why, Maryim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are chasing after something, Ailhuin,&rdquo; Nynaeve
said. &ldquo;Or rather, after some people.&rdquo; Egwene schooled herself to
stillness and hoped she was doing as well as Elayne, who was
sipping her tea as if she were listening to talk about dresses.
Egwene did not believe Ailhuin Guenna&rsquo;s dark eyes missed a great
deal. &ldquo;They stole some things, Ailhuin,&rdquo; Nynaeve went on. &ldquo;From my
mother. And they did murder. We are here to see justice done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn my soul,&rdquo; the large woman said, &ldquo;have you no
menfolk? Men are not good for much beyond heavy hauling and getting
in the way, most of the time&mdash;and kissing and such&mdash;but
if there&rsquo;s a battle to be fought or a thief to catch, I say let
them do it. Andor is as civilized as Tear. You are not Aiel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was no one else but us,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. &ldquo;Those
who might have come in our place were killed.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>The three murdered Aes Sedai</em>, Egwene
thought. <em>They could not have been Black Ajah. But if they had
not been killed, the Amyrlin would not have been able to trust
them. She&rsquo;s trying to keep to the bloody Three Oaths, but she is
skirting it close</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aaah,&rdquo; Ailhuin said sadly. &ldquo;They killed your men?
Brothers, or husbands, or fathers?&rdquo; Spots of color bloomed in
Nynaeve&rsquo;s cheeks, and the older woman mistook the emotion. &ldquo;No,
don&rsquo;t tell me, girl. I&rsquo;ll not pull up old grief. Let it lie on the
bottom till it melts away. There, there, you calm yourself.&rdquo; It was
an effort for Egwene not to growl with disgust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must tell you this,&rdquo; Nynaeve said in a stiff
voice. The red still colored her face. &ldquo;These murderers and thieves
are Darkfriends. They are women, but they are as dangerous as any
swordsman, Ailhuin. If you wondered why we did not seek an inn,
that is why. They may know we follow, and they may be watching for
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ailhuin waved it all away with a sniff. &ldquo;Of the four
most dangerous folk I know, two are women who never carry as much
as a knife, and only one of the men is a swordsman. As for
Darkfriends&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Maryim, when you are as old as I, you&rsquo;ll learn
that false Dragons are dangerous, lionfish are dangerous, sharks
are dangerous, and sudden storms out of the south; but Darkfriends
are fools. Filthy fools, but fools. The Dark One is locked up where
the Creator put him, and no Fetches or fangfish to scare children
will get him out. Fools don&rsquo;t frighten me unless they&rsquo;re working
the boat I&rsquo;m riding. I suppose you don&rsquo;t have any proof you could
take to the Defenders of the Stone? It would be just your word
against theirs?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>What is a &ldquo;Fetch&rdquo;?</em> Egwene wondered. <em>Or a
&ldquo;fangfish,&rdquo; for that matter</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will have proof when we find them,&rdquo; Nynaeve said.
&ldquo;They will have the things they stole, and we can describe them.
They are old things, and of little value to anyone but us, and our
friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would be surprised what old things can be
worth,&rdquo; Ailhuin said dryly. &ldquo;Old Leuese Mulan pulled up three
heartstone bowls and a cup in his nets last year, down in the
Fingers of the Dragon. Now, instead of a fishing smack, he owns a
ship trading up the river. Old fool did not even know what he had
till I told him. Very likely there&rsquo;s more right where those came
from, but Leuese couldn&rsquo;t even remember the exact spot. I do not
know how he ever managed to get a fish into his net. Half the
fishing boats in Tear were down there for months afterwards,
dragging for <em>cuendillar</em>, not grunts or flatfish, and some
had lords saying where to pull the nets. That&rsquo;s what old things can
be worth, if they are old enough. Now, I&rsquo;ve decided you do need a
man in this, and I know just the one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Nynaeve said quickly. &ldquo;If you mean a lord, one
of the High Lords, remember we have no proof to offer till we find
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ailhuin laughed until she wheezed. &ldquo;Girl, nobody from
the Maule knows a High Lord, or any kind of lord. Mudfish don&rsquo;t
school with silversides. I will bring you the dangerous man I know
who isn&rsquo;t a swordsman, and the more dangerous of the two, at that.
Juilin Sandar is a thief-catcher. The best of them. I do not know
how it is in Andor, but here a thief-catcher will work for you or
me as soon as for a lord or a merchant, and charge less at that.
Juilin can find these women for you if they can be found, and bring
your things back without you having to go near these
Darkfriends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve agreed as if she were still not entirely
sure, and Ailhuin tied those platforms to her shoes&mdash;clogs,
she called them&mdash;and hurried out. Egwene watched her go,
through one of the kitchen windows, past the horses and around the
corner up the alley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are learning how to be Aes Sedai, <em>
Maryim</em>,&rdquo; she said as she turned from the window. &ldquo;You
manipulate people as well as Moiraine.&rdquo; Nynaeve&rsquo;s face went
white.</p>

<p>Elayne stalked across the floor and slapped Egwene&rsquo;s
face. Egwene was so shocked she could only stare. &ldquo;You go too far,&rdquo;
the golden-haired woman said sharply. &ldquo;Too far. We must live
together, or we will surely die together! Did you give Ailhuin your
true name? Nynaeve told her what we could, that we seek
Darkfriends, and that was risk enough, linking us with Darkfriends.
She told her they were dangerous, murderers. Would you have had her
say they are Black Ajah? In Tear? Would you risk everything on
whether Ailhuin would keep <em>that</em> to herself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene rubbed her cheek gingerly. Elayne had a strong
arm. &ldquo;I do not have to like doing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Elayne sighed. &ldquo;Neither do I. But we <em>
do</em> have to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene turned back to peering through the window at
the horses. <em>I know we do. But I do not have to like
it</em>.</p>
