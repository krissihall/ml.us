<h4><em>A Message Out of the Shadow</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">E</span>ven
as he returned to the Inner City on foot, Mat
was far from certain that what he intended would actually work. It
would, if what he had been told was true, but it was the truth of
that he was not sure of. He avoided the oval plaza in front of the
Palace, but wandered around the sides of the huge structure and its
grounds, along streets that curved with the contours of the hills.
The golden domes of the Palace glittered, mockingly out of reach.
He had made his way almost all the way around, nearly back to the
plaza, when he saw it. A steep slope thick with low flowers, rising
from the street to a white wall of rough stone. Several leafy tree
limbs stuck over the top of the wall, and he could see the tops of
others beyond, in a garden of the Royal Palace.</p>

<p><em>A wall made to look like a cliff</em>, he
thought, <em>and a garden on the other side. Maybe Rand was telling
the truth</em>.</p>

<p>A casual look both ways showed him he had the curving
street to himself for the moment. He would have to hurry; the
curves did not allow him to see very far; someone could come along
any moment. He scrambled up the slope on all fours, careless of how
his boots ripped holes in the banks of red and white blossoms. The
rough stone of the wall gave plenty of fingerholds, and ridges and
knobs provided toeholds even for a man in boots.</p>

<p><em>Careless of them to make it so easy</em>, he
thought as he climbed. For a moment the climbing took him back home
with Rand and Perrin, to a journey they had made beyond the Sand
Hills, into the edge of the Mountains of Mist. When they returned
to Emond&rsquo;s Field, they had all caught the fury from everyone who
could lay hands on them&mdash;him worst of all; everyone assumed
it had been his idea&mdash;but for three days they had climbed the
cliffs, and slept under the sky, and eaten eggs filched from
redcrests&rsquo; nests, and plump, gray-winged grouse fetched with an
arrow, or a stone from a sling, and rabbits caught with snares, all
the while laughing about how they were not afraid of the mountains&rsquo;
bad luck and how they might find a treasure. He had brought home an
odd rock from that expedition, with the skull of a good-sized fish
somehow pressed into it, and a long, white tail feather dropped by
a snow eagle, and a piece of white stone as big as his hand that
looked almost as if it had been carved into a man&rsquo;s ear. He thought
it looked like an ear, even if Rand and Perrin did not, and Tam
al&rsquo;Thor had said it might be.</p>

<p>His fingers slipped out of a shallow groove, his
balance shifted and he lost the toehold under his left foot. With a
gasp, he barely caught hold of the top of the wall, and pulled
himself up the rest of the way. For a moment he lay there,
breathing hard. It would not have been that long a fall, but enough
to break his head. <em>Fool, letting my mind wander like that.
Nearly killed myself on those cliffs that way. That was all a long
time ago</em>. His mother had likely thrown all those things out
already, anyway. With one last look each way to make sure no one
had seen him&mdash;the curving length of street below was still
empty&mdash;he dropped inside the Palace grounds.</p>

<p>It was a large garden, with flagstoned walks through
expanses of grass among the trees, and grapevines thick on arbors
over the walks. And everywhere, flowers. White blossoms covering
the pear trees, and white and pink dotting the apple trees. Roses
in every color, and bright golden sunburst, and purple Emond&rsquo;s
Glory, and many he could not identify. Some he was not sure could
be real. One had odd blossoms in scarlet and gold that looked
almost like birds, and another seemed no different from a sunflower
except that its yellow flowers were two feet and more across and
stood on stalks as tall as an Ogier.</p>

<p>Boots crunched on flagstone, and he crouched low
behind a bush against the wall as two guardsmen marched past, their
long, white collars hanging over their breastplates. They never
glanced his way, and he grinned to himself. <em>Luck. With just a
little luck, they&rsquo;ll never see me till I hand the bloody thing to
Morgase</em>.</p>

<p>He slipped through the garden like a shadow, as if
stalking rabbits, freezing by a bush or hard against a tree trunk
when he heard boots. Two more pairs of soldiers strode by along the
paths, the second close enough for him to have taken two steps and
goosed them. As they vanished among the flowers and trees, he
plucked a deep red starblaze and stuck the wavy-petaled flower in
his hair with a grin. This was as much fun as stealing applecakes
at Sunday, and easier. Women always kept a sharp watch on their
baking; the fool soldiers never took their eyes off the
flagstones.</p>

<p>It was not long before he found himself against the
white wall of the Palace itself, and began sliding along it behind
a row of flowering white roses on slatted frames, searching for a
door. There were plenty of wide, arched windows just over his head,
but he thought it might be a bit harder to explain being found
climbing in through a window than walking down a hall. Two more
soldiers appeared, and he froze; they would pass within three paces
of him. He could hear voices from the window over his head, two
men, just loud enough for him to make out the words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;on their way to Tear, Great Master.&rdquo; The man
sounded frightened and obsequious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let them ruin his plans, if they can.&rdquo; This voice
was deeper and stronger, a man used to command. &ldquo;It will serve him
right if three untrained girls can foil him. He was always a fool,
and he is still a fool. Is there any word of the boy? He is the one
who can destroy us all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Great Master. He has vanished. But, Great
Master, one of the girls is Morgase&rsquo;s nit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat half turned, then caught himself. The soldiers
were coming closer; they did not appear to have seen his start
through the thickly woven rose stems. <em>Move, you fools! Get by
so I can see who this man bloody is!</em> He had lost some of the
conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;has been far too impatient since regaining
his freedom,&rdquo; the deep voice was saying. &ldquo;He never realized the
best plans take time to mature. He wants the world in a day, and
<em>Callandor</em> besides. The Great Lord take him! He may seize
the girl and try to make some use of her. And that might strain my
own plans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you say, Great Master. Shall I order her brought
out of Tear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. The fool would take it as a move against him, if
he knew. And who can say what he chooses to watch aside from the
sword? See that she dies quietly, Comar. Let her death attract no
notice at all.&rdquo; His laughter was a rich rumble. &ldquo;Those ignorant
slatterns in their Tower will have a difficult time producing her
after this disappearance. This may all be just as well. Let it be
done quickly. Quickly, before he has time to take her himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two soldiers were almost abreast of him; Mat
tried to will their feet to move faster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great Master,&rdquo; the other man said uncertainly, &ldquo;that
may be difficult. We know she is on her way to Tear, but the vessel
she traveled on was found at Aringill, and all three of them had
left it earlier. We do not know whether she has taken another ship,
or is riding south. And it may not be easy to find her once she
reaches Tear, Great Master. Perhaps if you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are there none but fools in the world, now?&rdquo; the
deep voice said harshly. &ldquo;Do you think I could move in Tear without
him knowing? I do not mean to fight him, not now, not yet. Bring me
the girl&rsquo;s head, Comar. Bring me all three heads, or you will pray
for me to take yours!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Great Master. It shall be as you say. Yes.
Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The soldiers crunched past, never looking to either
side. Mat only waited for their backs to pass before leaping up to
catch the broad stone windowsill and pull himself high enough to
see through the window.</p>

<p>He barely noticed the fringed Tarabon carpet on the
floor, worth a fat purse of silver. One of the broad, carved doors
was swinging shut. A tall man, with wide shoulders and a deep chest
straining the green silk of his silver-embroidered coat, was
staring at the door with dark blue eyes. His black beard was close
cut, with a streak of white over his chin. All in all, he looked a
hard man, and one used to giving orders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Great Master,&rdquo; he said suddenly, and Mat almost
lost his grip on the sill. He had thought this must be the man with
the deep voice, but it was the cringing voice he heard. Not
cringing now, but still the same. &ldquo;It shall be as you say, Great
Master,&rdquo; the man said bitterly. &ldquo;I will cut the three wenches&rsquo;
heads off myself. As soon as I can find them!&rdquo; He strode through
the door, and Mat let himself back down.</p>

<p>For a moment he crouched there behind the rose
frames. Someone in the Palace wanted Elayne dead, and had thrown in
Egwene and Nynaeve as afterthoughts. <em>What under the Light are
they doing, going to Tear?</em> It had to be them.</p>

<p>He pulled the Daughter-Heir&rsquo;s letter out of the
lining of his coat and frowned at it. Maybe, with this in his hand,
Morgase would believe him. He could describe one of the men. But
the time for skulking was past; the big fellow could be off to Tear
before he even found Morgase, and whatever she did then, there was
no guarantee it could stop him.</p>

<p>Taking a deep breath, Mat wiggled between two of the
rose frames at the cost of only a few pricks and snags from the
thorns, and started down the flagstone path after the soldiers. He
held Elayne&rsquo;s letter out in front of him so the golden lily seal
was plainly visible, and went over in his mind exactly what he
meant to say. When he had been sneaking about, guardsmen kept
popping up like mushrooms after rain, but now he walked almost the
length of the garden without seeing even one. He passed several
doors. It would not be so good to enter the Palace without
permission&mdash;the Guards might do nasty things first and listen
after&mdash;but he was beginning to think about going through a
door when it opened and a helmetless young officer with one golden
knot on his shoulder strode out.</p>

<p>The man&rsquo;s hand immediately went to his sword hilt,
and he had a foot of steel bared before Mat could push the letter
toward him. &ldquo;Elayne, the Daughter-Heir, sends this letter to her
mother, Queen Morgase, Captain.&rdquo; He held the letter so the lily
seal was prominent.</p>

<p>The officer&rsquo;s dark eyes flickered to either side, as
if searching for other people, without really ever leaving Mat.
&ldquo;How did you come into this garden?&rdquo; He did not draw his sword
further, but he did not sheath it, either. &ldquo;Elber is on the main
gates. He&rsquo;s a fool, but he would never let anyone wander loose into
the Palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fat man with eyes like a rat?&rdquo; Mat cursed his
tongue, but the officer gave a sharp nod; he almost smiled, too,
but it did not seem to lessen his vigilance, or his suspicion. &ldquo;He
grew angry when he learned I had come from Tar Valon, and he
wouldn&rsquo;t even give me a chance to show the letter or mention the
Daughter-Heir&rsquo;s name. He said he would arrest me if I did not go,
so I climbed the wall. I promised I would deliver this to Queen
Morgase herself, you see, Captain. I promised it, and I always keep
my promises. You see the seal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That bloody garden wall again,&rdquo; the officer
muttered. &ldquo;It should be built three times so high.&rdquo; He eyed Mat.
&ldquo;Guardsman-lieutenant, not captain. I am Guardsman-lieutenant
Tallanvor. I recognize the Daughter-Heir&rsquo;s seal.&rdquo; His sword finally
slid all the way back into the sheath. He stretched out a hand; not
his sword hand. &ldquo;Give me the letter, and I will take it to the
Queen. After I show you out. Some would not be so gentle at finding
you walking about loose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promised to put it in her hands myself,&rdquo; Mat said.
<em>Light, I never thought they might not let me give it to
her</em>. &ldquo;I did promise. To the Daughter-Heir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat hardly realized Tallanvor&rsquo;s hand was moving
before the officer&rsquo;s sword was resting against his neck. &ldquo;I will
take you to the Queen, countryman,&rdquo; Tallanvor said softly. &ldquo;But
know that I can take your head before you blink if you so much as
think of harming her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat put on his best grin. That slightly curved blade
felt sharp on the side of his neck. &ldquo;I am a loyal Andorman,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;and a faithful subject of the Queen, the Light illumine her.
Why, if I had been here during the winter, I&rsquo;d have followed Lord
Gaebril for sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tallanvor gave him a tight-mouthed stare, then
finally took his sword away. Mat swallowed and stopped himself from
touching his throat to see if he had been cut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take the flower out of your hair,&rdquo; Tallanvor said as
he sheathed his blade. &ldquo;Do you think you came here courting?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat snatched the starblaze blossom out of his hair
and followed the officer. <em>Bloody fool, putting a flower in my
hair. I have to stop playing the fool, now</em>.</p>

<p>It was not so much following, really, for Tallanvor
kept an eye on him even while he led the way. The result was an odd
sort of procession, with the officer to one side of him and ahead,
but half turned in case Mat tried anything. For his part, Mat
attempted to look as innocent as a babe splashing in his
bathwater.</p>

<p>The colorful tapestries on the walls had earned their
weavers silver, and so had the rugs on the white tile floors, even
here in the halls. Gold and silver stood everywhere, plates and
platters, bowls and cups, on chests and low cabinets of polished
wood, as fine as anything he had seen in the Tower. Servants darted
everywhere, in red livery with white collars and cuffs and the
White Lion of Andor on their breasts. He found himself wondering if
Morgase played at dice. <em>Wool-headed thought. Queens don&rsquo;t toss
dice. But when I give her this letter and tell her somebody in her
Palace means to kill Elayne, I&rsquo;ll wager she gives me a fat
purse</em>. He indulged himself in a small fancy of being made a
lord; surely the man who revealed a plot to murder the
Daughter-Heir could expect some such reward.</p>

<p>Tallanvor led him down so many corridors and across
so many courtyards that he was beginning to wonder if he could find
his way out again without help, when suddenly one of the courts had
more than servants in it. A columned walk surrounded the court,
with a round pool in the middle with white and yellow fish swimming
beneath lilypads and floating white waterlilies. Men in colorful
coats embroidered in gold or silver, women with wide dresses worked
even more elaborately, stood attendance on a woman with red-gold
hair who sat on the raised rim of the pool, trailing her fingers in
the water and staring sadly at the fish that rose to her fingertips
in hopes of food. A Great Serpent ring encircled the third finger
of her left hand. A tall, dark man stood at her shoulder, the red
silk of his coat almost hidden by the gold leaves and scrolls
worked on it, but it was the woman who held Mat&rsquo;s eye.</p>

<p>He did not need the wreath of finely made golden
roses in her hair, or the stole hanging over her dress of white
slashed with red, the red length of the stole embroidered with the
Lions of Andor, to know he was looking at Morgase, by the Grace of
the Light, Queen of Andor, Defender of the Realm, Protector of the
People, High Seat of House Trakand. She had Elayne&rsquo;s face and
beauty, but it was what Elayne would have when she had ripened.
Every other woman in the courtyard faded into the background by her
very presence.</p>

<p><em>I&rsquo;d dance a jig with her, and steal a kiss in the
moonlight, too, no matter how old she is</em>. He shook himself.
<em>Remember exactly who she is!</em></p>

<p>Tallanvor went to one knee, a fist pressed to the
white stone of the courtyard. &ldquo;My Queen, I bring a messenger who
bears a letter from the Lady Elayne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat eyed the man&rsquo;s posture, then contented himself
with a deep bow. &ldquo;From the Daughter-Heir&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;my Queen.&rdquo;
He held out the letter as he bowed, so the golden yellow wax of the
seal was visible. <em>Once she reads it, and knows Elayne is all
right, I will tell her</em>. Morgase turned her deep blue eyes on
him. <em>Light! As soon as she&rsquo;s in a good mood</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bring a letter from my scapegrace child?&rdquo; Her
voice was cold, but with an edge that spoke of heat ready to rise.
&ldquo;That must mean she is alive, at least! Where is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Tar Valon, my Queen,&rdquo; he managed to get out. <em>
Light, wouldn&rsquo;t I like to see a staring match between her and the
Amyrlin</em>. On second thought, he decided he would rather not.
&ldquo;At least, she was when I left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morgase waved a hand impatiently, and Tallanvor rose
to take the letter from Mat and hand it to her. For a moment she
frowned at the lily seal, then broke it with a sharp twist of her
wrists. She murmured to herself as she read, shaking her head at
every other line. &ldquo;She can say no more, can she?&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;We
shall see whether she holds to that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Abruptly her face
brightened. &ldquo;Gaebril, she has been raised to the Accepted. Less
than a year in the Tower, and raised already.&rdquo; The smile went as
suddenly as it had come, and her mouth tightened. &ldquo;When I put my
hands on the wretched child, she will wish she were still a
novice.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Light</em>, Mat thought, <em>will nothing put her
in a good mood?</em> He decided he was just going to have to say it
out, but he wished she did not look as if she meant to cut
someone&rsquo;s head off. &ldquo;My Queen, by chance I overheard&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be silent, boy,&rdquo; the dark man in the gold-encrusted
coat said calmly. He was a handsome man, almost as good-looking as
Galad and nearly as youthful-seeming, despite the white streaking
his temples, but built on a bigger scale, with more than Rand&rsquo;s
height and very nearly Perrin&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;We will hear what you
have to say in a moment.&rdquo; He reached over Morgase&rsquo;s shoulder and
plucked the letter out of her hand. Her glare turned on him&mdash;Mat could see her temper heating&mdash;but the dark man laid a
strong hand on her shoulder, never taking his eyes off what he was
reading, and Morgase&rsquo;s anger melted. &ldquo;It seems she has left the
Tower again,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;On the service of the Amyrlin Seat. The
woman oversteps herself again, Morgase.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat had no trouble holding his tongue. <em>Luck</em>.
It was stuck to the roof of his mouth. <em>Sometimes I don&rsquo;t know
if it&rsquo;s good or bad</em>. The dark man was the owner of the deep
voice, the &ldquo;Great Master&rdquo; who wanted Elayne&rsquo;s head. S<em>he called
him Gaebril. Her advisor wants to murder Elayne? Light!</em> And
Morgase was staring up at him like an adoring dog with her master&rsquo;s
hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>Gaebril turned nearly black eyes on Mat. The man had
a forceful gaze, and a look of knowing. &ldquo;What can you tell us of
this, boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;my Lord.&rdquo; Mat cleared his
throat; the man&rsquo;s stare was worse than the Amyrlin&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I went to
Tar Valon to see my sister. She&rsquo;s a novice. Else Grinwell. I&rsquo;m Thom
Grinwell, my Lord. The Lady Elayne learned I was meaning to see
Caemlyn on my way back home&mdash;I&rsquo;m from Comfrey, my Lord; a
little village north of Baerlon; I&rsquo;d never seen any place bigger
than Baerlon before I went to Tar Valon&mdash;and she&mdash;the
Lady Elayne, I mean&mdash;gave me that letter to bring.&rdquo; He
thought Morgase had glanced at him when he said he came from north
of Baerlon, but he knew there was a village called Comfrey there;
he remembered hearing it mentioned.</p>

<p>Gaebril nodded, but he said, &ldquo;Do you know where
Elayne was going, boy? Or on what business? Speak the truth, and
you have nothing to fear. Lie, and you will be put to the
question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat did not have to pretend a worried frown. &ldquo;My
Lord, I only saw the Daughter-Heir the once. She gave me the letter&mdash;and a gold mark!&mdash;and told me to bring it to the
Queen. I know no more of what is in it than I&rsquo;ve heard here.&rdquo;
Gaebril appeared to consider it, with no sign on that dark face of
whether he believed a word or not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Gaebril,&rdquo; Morgase said suddenly. &ldquo;Too many have
been put to the question. I can see the need as you have shown it
to me, but not for this. Not a boy who only brought a letter whose
contents he does not know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As my Queen commands, so shall it be,&rdquo; the dark man
said. The tone was respectful, but he touched her cheek in a way
that made color come to her face and her lips part as if she
expected a kiss.</p>

<p>Morgase drew an unsteady breath. &ldquo;Tell me, Thom
Grinwell, did my daughter look well when you saw her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my Queen. She smiled, and laughed, and showed a
saucy tongue&mdash;I mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morgase laughed softly at the look on his face. &ldquo;Do
not be afraid, young man. Elayne does have a saucy tongue, far too
often for her own good. I am happy she is well.&rdquo; Those blue eyes
studied him deeply. &ldquo;A young man who has left his small village
often finds it difficult to return to it. I think you will travel
far before you see Comfrey again. Perhaps you will even return to
Tar Valon. If you do, and if you see my daughter, tell her that
what is said in anger is often repented. I will not remove her from
the White Tower before time. Tell her that I often think of my own
time there, and miss the quiet talks with Sheriam in her study.
Tell her that I said that, Thom Grinwell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat shrugged uncomfortably. &ldquo;Yes, my Queen. But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I do not mean to go to Tar Valon again. Once in any man&rsquo;s
life is enough. My da needs me to help work the farm. My sisters
will be stuck with the milking, with me gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gaebril laughed, a deep rumble of amusement. &ldquo;Are you
anxious then to milk cows, boy? Perhaps you should see something of
the world before it changes. Here!&rdquo; He produced a purse and tossed
it; Mat felt coins through the wash-leather when he caught it. &ldquo;If
Elayne can give you a gold mark for carrying her letter, I will
give you ten for bringing it safely. See the world before you go
back to your cows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my Lord.&rdquo; Mat lifted the purse and managed a
weak grin. &ldquo;Thank you, my Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the dark man had already waved him away and
turned to Morgase with his fists on his hips. &ldquo;I think the time has
come, Morgase, to lance that festering sore on the border of Andor.
By your marriage to Taringail Damodred, you have a claim to the Sun
Throne. The Queen&rsquo;s Guards can make that claim as strong as any.
Perhaps I can even aid them, in some small way. Hear me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tallanvor touched Mat on the arm, and they backed
away, bowing. Mat did not think anyone noticed. Gaebril was still
speaking, and every lord and lady seemed to hang on his words.
Morgase was frowning as she listened, yet she nodded as much as any
other.</p>
