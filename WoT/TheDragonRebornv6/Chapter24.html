<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">S</span>unlight
through the carved shutters, creeping across
the bed, woke Mat. For a moment, he only lay there, frowning. He
had not reasoned out any plan for escaping from Tar Valon before
sleep had overtaken him, but neither had he given up. Too much
memory still lay covered with fog, but he would not give up.</p>

<p>Two serving women came bustling with hot water and a
tray heavy with food, laughing and telling him how much better he
looked already, and how soon he would be back on his feet if he did
what the Aes Sedai told him. He answered them curtly, trying not to
sound bitter. <em>Let them think I mean to go along</em>. His
stomach rumbled at the smells from the tray.</p>

<p>When they left, he tossed aside his blanket and
hopped out of bed, pausing only to stuff half a slice of ham into
his mouth before pouring out water to wash and shave. Staring into
the mirror above the washstand, he paused in lathering his face. He
did look better.</p>

<p>His cheeks were still hollow, but not quite as hollow
as they had been. The dark circles had vanished from under his
eyes, which no longer seemed set so deep in his head. It was as if
every bite he had eaten the night before had gone into putting meat
on his bones. He even felt stronger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At this rate,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;I will be gone before
they know it.&rdquo; But he was still surprised when, after shaving, he
sat down and consumed every scrap of ham, turnip, and pear on the
tray.</p>

<p>He was sure they expected him to climb back into bed
once he had eaten, but instead, he dressed. Stamping his feet to
settle them in his boots, he eyed his spare clothes and decided to
leave them, for now. <em>I have to know what I&rsquo;m doing, first. And
if I have to leave them</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He tucked the dice cups into his
pouch. With those, he could get all the clothes he needed.</p>

<p>Opening the door, he peeked out. More doors paneled
in pale, golden wood lined the hall, with colorful tapestries
between, and a runner of blue carpet ran down the white-tiled
floor. But there was no one out there. No guard. He tossed his
cloak over one shoulder and hurried out. Now to find a way
outside.</p>

<p>It took some little wandering, down stairs and along
corridors and across open courts, before he found what he wanted, a
doorway to the outside, and he saw people before then: serving
women and white-clad novices hurrying about their chores, the
novices running even harder than the servants; a handful of roughly
dressed male servants carrying large chests and other heavy loads;
Accepted in their banded dresses. Even a few Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai did not seem to notice him as they
strode along, intent on whatever purpose, or else they gave him no
more than a passing glance. His were country clothes, but well
made; he did not look a vagabond, and the serving men showed that
men were allowed in this part of the Tower. He suspected they might
take him for another servant, and that was just as well with him,
so long as no one asked him to lift anything.</p>

<p>He did feel some regret that none of the women he saw
was Egwene or Nynaeve, or even Elayne. <em>She&rsquo;s a pretty one, even
if she does have her nose in the air half the time. And she could
tell me how to find Egwene and the Wisdom. I cannot go without
saying goodbye. Light, I don&rsquo;t suppose one of them would turn me
in, just because they are becoming Aes Sedai themselves? Burn me
for a fool! They&rsquo;d never do that. Anyway, I will risk it</em>.</p>

<p>But once out-of-doors, under a bright morning sky
with only a few drifting white clouds, he put the women from his
mind for the time. He was looking across a wide, flagstoned yard
with a plain stone fountain in the middle and a barracks on the
other side that was made of gray stone. It looked almost like a
huge boulder among the few trees growing out of rimmed holes in the
flagstones close by. Guardsmen in their shirtsleeves sat in front
of the long, low building, tending weapons and armor and harness.
Guardsmen were what he wanted, now.</p>

<p>He sauntered across the yard and watched the soldiers
as if he had nothing better to do. As they worked they talked and
laughed among themselves like men after the harvest. Now and again
one of them looked curiously at Mat as he strolled among them, but
none challenged his right to be there. From time to time he asked a
casual question. And finally he got the answer he sought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bridge guard?&rdquo; said a stocky, dark-haired man no
more than five years older than Mat. His words had a heavy Illianer
accent. Young he might have been, but a thin white scar crossed his
left cheek, and the hands oiling his sword moved with familiarity
and competence. He squinted up at Mat before returning to his task.
&ldquo;I do be on the bridge guard, and back there again this even. Why
do you ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just wondering what conditions were like on
the other side of the river.&rdquo; <em>I might as well find that out,
too</em>. &ldquo;Good for traveling? It can&rsquo;t be muddy, unless you have
had more rain than I know about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which side of the river?&rdquo; the guardsman asked
placidly. His eyes did not lift from the oiled rag he was running
along his blade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;east. The east side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No mud. Whitecloaks.&rdquo; The man leaned to one side to
spit, but his voice did not change. &ldquo;Whitecloaks do be poking their
noses into every village for ten miles. They have no hurt anyone
yet, but them just being there do upset the folk. Fortune prick me
if I do no think they wish to provoke us, for they do look as if
they would attack if they could. No good for anyone who do want to
travel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about west, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The same.&rdquo; The guardsman raised his eyes to Mat&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;But you will no be crossing, lad, east or west. Your name do be
Matrim Cauthon, or Fortune abandon me. Last night a sister, herself
in person, did come to the bridge where I did stand guard. She did
drill your features at us till each could speak them back to her. A
guest, she did say, and no to be harmed. But no to be allowed out
of the city, either, if you must be tied hand and foot to keep you
from it.&rdquo; His eyes narrowed. &ldquo;Is it that you did steal something
from them?&rdquo; he asked doubtfully. &ldquo;You do no have the look of those
the sisters do guest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t steal anything!&rdquo; Mat said indignantly. <em>
Burn me, I didn&rsquo;t even get a chance to work around to it easy. They
must</em> all <em>know me</em>. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no thief!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it is no that I do see in your face. No
thievery. But you do have the look of the fellow who did try to
sell me the Horn of Valere three days gone. So he did claim it did
be, all bent and battered as it did be. Do you have a Horn of
Valere to sell? Or mayhap it do be the Dragon&rsquo;s sword?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat gave a jump at the mention of the Horn, but he,
managed to keep his voice level. &ldquo;I was sick.&rdquo; Others of the
guardsmen were looking at him now. <em>Light, they&rsquo;ll all know I am
not supposed to leave, now</em>. He forced a laugh. &ldquo;The sisters
Healed me.&rdquo; Some of the guardsmen frowned at him. Perhaps they
thought other men should show more respect than to call the Aes
Sedai sisters. &ldquo;I guess the Aes Sedai don&rsquo;t want me to go before I
have all my strength back.&rdquo; He tried willing the men, all of those
watching him now, to accept that. <em>Just a man who was Healed.
Nothing more. No reason to trouble yourself about him any
further</em>.</p>

<p>The Illianer nodded. &ldquo;You do have the look of
sickness in your face, too. Perhaps that do be the reason. But
never did I hear of so much effort to keep one sick man in the
city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the reason,&rdquo; Mat said firmly. They were all
still looking at him. &ldquo;Well, I need to be going. They said I have
to take walks. Lots of long walks. To build up strength, you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He felt their eyes following him as he left, and he
scowled. He had simply meant to find out how well his description
had been passed around. If only the officers among the bridge
guards had had it, he might have been able to slip by. He had
always been good at slipping into places unseen. And out. It was a
talent you developed when your mother always suspected you were up
to some mischief and you had four sisters to tell on you. <em>And
now I&rsquo;ve made sure half a barracks full of guardsmen will know me.
Blood and bloody ashes!</em></p>

<p>Much of the Tower grounds were gardens full of trees,
leatherleaf and paperbark and elms, and he soon found himself
walking along a wide, twisting graveled path. It could have led
through countryside, if not for the towers visible over the
treetops. And the white bulk of the Tower itself, behind him but
pressing on him as if he carried it on his shoulders. If there were
ways out of the Tower grounds that were not watched, this seemed
the place to find them. If they existed.</p>

<p>A girl in novice white appeared ahead on the path,
striding purposefully toward him. Wrapped in her own thoughts, she
did not see him at first. When she came close enough for him to
make out her big, dark eyes and the way her hair was braided, he
grinned suddenly. He knew this girl&mdash;memory drifting up from
shrouded depths&mdash;though he would never have expected to find
her here. He had never expected to see her again at all. He grinned
to himself. <em>Good luck to balance bad</em>. As he remembered,
she had quite an eye for the boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Else,&rdquo; he called to her. &ldquo;Else Grinwell. You
remember me, don&rsquo;t you? Mat Cauthon. A friend and I visited your
father&rsquo;s farm. Remember? Have you decided to become Aes Sedai,
then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stopped short, staring at him. &ldquo;What are you
doing up and out?&rdquo; she said coldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know about that, do you?&rdquo; He moved closer to
her, but she stepped back, keeping her distance. He stopped. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
not catching. I was Healed, Else.&rdquo; Those large, dark eyes seemed
more knowing than he remembered, and not nearly so warm, but he
supposed studying to be an Aes Sedai could do that. &ldquo;What is the
matter, Else? You look like you don&rsquo;t know me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you,&rdquo; she said. Her manner was not as he
remembered, either; he thought she could give Elayne lessons now.
&ldquo;I have&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;work to be about. Let me by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He grimaced. The path was broad enough for six to
walk abreast without crowding. &ldquo;I told you it isn&rsquo;t catching.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me by!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Muttering to himself, he stepped to one edge of the
gravel. She went past him along the other side, watching to make
sure he did not come closer. Once by, she quickened her steps,
glancing over her shoulder at him until she was out of sight around
a bend.</p>

<p><em>Wanted to make sure I didn&rsquo;t follow her</em>, he
thought sourly. <em>First the guardsmen, and now Else. My luck is not
in, today</em>.</p>

<p>He started off again, and soon heard a ferocious
clatter from one side ahead, like dozens of sticks being beat
together. Curious, he turned off toward it, into the trees.</p>

<p>A little way brought him to a large expanse of bare
ground, the earth beaten hard, at least fifty paces across and
nearly twice as long. At intervals around it under the trees stood
wooden stands holding quarterstaffs, and practice swords made of
strips of wood bound loosely together, and a few real swords and
axes and spears.</p>

<p>Spaced across the open ground, pairs of men, most
stripped to the waist, flailed at each other with more practice
swords. Some moved so smoothly it almost seemed they danced with
one another, flowing from stance to stance, stroke to counterstroke
in continuous motion. There was nothing quickly apparent aside from
skill to mark them from the others, but Mat was sure he was
watching Warders.</p>

<p>Those who did not move so smoothly were all younger,
each pair under the watchful eyes of an older man who seemed to
radiate a dangerous grace even standing still. <em>Warders and
students</em>, Mat decided.</p>

<p>He was not the only audience. Not ten paces from him,
half a dozen women with ageless Aes Sedai faces and as many more in
the banded white dresses of the Accepted stood watching one pair of
students, bare to the waist and slick with sweat, under the
guidance of a Warder shaped much like a block of stone. The Warder
used a short-stemmed pipe in one hand, trailing tabac smoke, to
direct his pupils.</p>

<p>Sitting down cross-legged under a leatherleaf, Mat
rooted three large pebbles out of the ground and began to juggle
them idly. He did not feel weak, exactly, but it was good to sit.
If there was a way out of the Tower grounds, it would not go away
while he took a short rest.</p>

<p>Before he had been there five minutes he knew who it
was the Aes Sedai and Accepted were watching. One of the blocky
Warder&rsquo;s pupils was a tall, lithe young man who moved like a cat.
<em>And almost as pretty as a girl</em>, Mat thought wryly. Every
woman was staring at the tall fellow with sparkling eyes, even the
Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>The tall man handled his practice sword almost as
deftly as the Warders, now and then earning an approving gravelly
comment from his teacher. It was not that his opponent, a youth
more Mat&rsquo;s age, with red-gold hair, was unskilled. Far from it, as
much as Mat could see, though he had never claimed to know anything
about swords. The golden-haired man met every lightning attack,
turning it away before the bound strips could strike him, and even
launched an occasional attack of his own. But the handsome fellow
countered those attacks and flowed back into his own in the space
of a heartbeat.</p>

<p>Mat shifted the pebbles to one hand, but kept them
spinning in the air. He did not think he would care to face either
of them. Certainly not with a sword.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Break!&rdquo; The Warder&rsquo;s voice sounded like rocks
emptying out of a bucket. Chests heaving, the two men let their
practice swords fall to their sides. Sweat matted their hair. &ldquo;You
can rest till I finish my pipe. But rest fast; I am almost in the
dottle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now that they had stopped dancing about, Mat got a
good look at the youth with the red-gold hair and let the pebbles
drop. <em>Burn me, I&rsquo;ll bet my whole purse that&rsquo;s Elayne&rsquo;s brother.
And the other one&rsquo;s Galad, or I&rsquo;ll eat my boots</em>. On the
journey from Toman Head it had seemed half of Elayne&rsquo;s conversation
had been of Gawyn&rsquo;s virtues and Galad&rsquo;s vices. Oh, Gawyn had some
vices according to Elayne, but they were small; to Mat they sounded
like the sort of things no one but a sister would consider vices at
all. As for Galad, once Elayne was pinned down, he sounded like
what every mother said she wanted her son to be. Mat did not think
he wanted to spend much time in Galad&rsquo;s company. Egwene blushed
whenever Galad was mentioned, though she seemed to think no one
noticed.</p>

<p>A ripple seemed to pass through the watching women
when Gawyn and Galad stopped, and they appeared on the point of
stepping forward almost as one. But Gawyn caught sight of Mat, said
something quietly to Galad, and the two of them walked by the
women. The Aes Sedai and Accepted turned to follow with their eyes.
Mat scrambled to his feet as the pair approached.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are Mat Cauthon, are you not?&rdquo; Gawyn said with a
grin. &ldquo;I was sure I recognized you from Egwene&rsquo;s description. And
Elayne&rsquo;s. I understand you were sick. Are you better now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Mat said. He wondered if he was supposed
to call Gawyn &ldquo;my Lord&rdquo; or something of the sort. He had refused to
call Elayne &ldquo;my Lady&rdquo;&mdash;not that she had demanded it, actually&mdash;and he decided he would not do her brother better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you come to the practice yard to learn the
sword?&rdquo; Galad asked.</p>

<p>Mat shook his head. &ldquo;I was only out walking. I don&rsquo;t
know much about swords. I think I&rsquo;ll put my trust in a good bow, or
a good quarterstaff. I know how to use those.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you spend much time around Nynaeve,&rdquo; Galad said,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll need bow, quarterstaff, <em>and</em> sword to protect
yourself. And I don&rsquo;t know whether that would be enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gawyn looked at him wonderingly. &ldquo;Galad, you just
very nearly made a joke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do have a sense of humor, Gawyn,&rdquo; Galad said with
a frown. &ldquo;You only think I do not because I do not care to mock
people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a shake of his head, Gawyn turned back to Mat.
&ldquo;You should learn something of the sword. Everyone can do with that
sort of knowledge these days. Your friend&mdash;Rand al&rsquo;Thor&mdash;carried a most unusual sword. What do you hear of him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen Rand in a long time,&rdquo; Mat said
quickly. Just for a moment, when he had mentioned Rand, Gawyn&rsquo;s
look had gained intensity. <em>Light, does</em> he <em>know about
Rand? He couldn&rsquo;t. If he did, he&rsquo;d be denouncing me for a
Darkfriend just for being Rand&rsquo;s friend. But he knows
something</em>. &ldquo;Swords aren&rsquo;t the be-all and end-all, you know. I
could do fairly well against either of you, I think, if you had a
sword and I had my quarterstaff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gawyn&rsquo;s cough was obviously meant to swallow a laugh.
Much too politely, he said, &ldquo;You must be very good.&rdquo; Galad&rsquo;s face
was frankly disbelieving.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was that they both clearly thought he was
making a wild boast. Perhaps it was because he had mishandled
questioning the guardsman. Perhaps it was because Else, who had
such an eye for the boys, wanted nothing to do with him, and all
those women were staring at Galad like cats watching a jug of
cream. Aes Sedai and Accepted or not, they were still women. All
these explanations ran through Mat&rsquo;s head, but he rejected them
angrily, especially the last. He was going to do it because it
would be fun. And it might earn some coin. His luck would not even
have to be back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will wager,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;two silver marks to two
from each of you that I can beat both of you at once, just the way
I said. You can&rsquo;t have fairer odds than that. There are two of you,
and one of me, so two to one are fair odds.&rdquo; He almost laughed
aloud at the consternation on their faces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat,&rdquo; Gawyn said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no need to make wagers.
You have been sick. Perhaps we will try this some time when you are
stronger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be far from a fair wager,&rdquo; Galad said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not take your wager, now or later. You are from the same
village as Egwene, are you not? I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I would not have her angry
with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does she have to do with it? Thump me once with
one of your swords, and I will hand over a silver mark to each of
you. If I thump you till you quit, you give me two each. Don&rsquo;t you
think you can do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is ridiculous,&rdquo; Galad said. &ldquo;You would have no
chance against one trained swordsman, let alone two. I&rsquo;ll not take
such advantage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think that?&rdquo; asked a gravel voice. The blocky
Warder joined them, thick black eyebrows pulled down in a scowl.
&ldquo;You think you two are good enough with your swords to take a boy
with a stick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would not be fair, Hammar Gaidin,&rdquo; Galad
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has been sick,&rdquo; Gawyn added. &ldquo;There is no need
for this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the yard,&rdquo; Hammar grated with a jerk of his head
back over his shoulder. Galad and Gawyn gave Mat regretful looks,
then obeyed. The Warder eyed Mat up and down doubtfully. &ldquo;Are you
sure you&rsquo;re up to this, lad? Now I take a close look at you, you
ought to be in a sickbed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am already out of one,&rdquo; Mat said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m up to
it. I have to be. I don&rsquo;t want to lose my two marks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hammar&rsquo;s heavy brows rose in surprise. &ldquo;You mean to
hold to that wager, lad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I need the money.&rdquo; Mat laughed.</p>

<p>His laughter cut off abruptly as he turned toward the
nearest stand that held quarterstaffs and his knees almost buckled.
He stiffened them so quickly he thought anyone who noticed would
think he had just stumbled. At the stand he took his time choosing
out a staff, nearly two inches thick and almost a foot taller than
he was. <em>I have to win this. I opened my fool mouth, and now I
have to win. I can&rsquo;t afford to lose those two marks. Without those
to build on, it will take forever to win the money I need</em>.</p>

<p>When he turned back, the quarterstaff in both hands
before him, Gawyn and Galad were already waiting out where they had
been practicing. <em>I have to win</em>. &ldquo;Luck,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Time
to toss the dice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hammar gave him an odd look. &ldquo;You speak the Old
Tongue, lad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat stared back at him for a moment, not speaking. He
felt cold to the bone. With an effort, he made his feet start out
onto the practice yard. &ldquo;Remember the wager,&rdquo; he said loudly. &ldquo;Two
silver marks from each of you against two from me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A buzz rose from the Accepted as they realized what
was happening. The Aes Sedai watched in silence. Disapproving
silence.</p>

<p>Gawyn and Galad split apart, one to either side of
him, keeping their distance, neither with his sword more than
half-raised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No wager,&rdquo; Gawyn said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no wager.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the same time, Galad said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not take your
money like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean to take yours,&rdquo; Mat said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; Hammar roared. &ldquo;If they have not the nerve to
cover your wager, lad, I&rsquo;ll pay the score myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Gawyn said. &ldquo;If you insist on it&mdash;done!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Galad hesitated a moment more before growling, &ldquo;Done,
then. Let us put an end to this farce.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The moment&rsquo;s warning was all Mat needed. As Galad
rushed at him, he slid his hands along the quarterstaff and
pivoted. The end of the staff thudded into the tall man&rsquo;s ribs,
bringing a grunt and a stumble. Mat let the staff bounce off Galad
and spun, carrying it on around just as Gawyn came within range.
The staff dipped, darted under Gawyn&rsquo;s practice sword, and clipped
his ankle out from under him. As Gawyn fell, Mat completed the spin
in time to catch Galad across his upraised wrist, sending his
practice sword flying. As if his wrist did not pain him at all,
Galad threw himself into a smooth, rolling dive and came up with
his sword in both hands.</p>

<p>Ignoring him for the moment, Mat half turned,
twisting his wrists to whip the length of the staff back beside
him. Gawyn, just starting to rise, took the blow on the side of his
head with a loud thump only partly softened by the padding of hair.
He went down in a heap.</p>

<p>Mat was only vaguely aware of an Aes Sedai rushing
out to tend Elayne&rsquo;s fallen brother. <em>I hope he&rsquo;s all right. He
should be. I&rsquo;ve hit myself harder than that falling off a
fence</em>. He still had Galad to deal with, and from the way Galad
was poised on the balls of his feet, sword raised precisely, he had
begun to take Mat seriously.</p>

<p>Mat&rsquo;s legs chose that moment to tremble. <em>Light, I
can&rsquo;t weaken now</em>. But he could feel it creeping back in, the
wobbly feeling, the hunger as if he had not eaten for days. <em>If
I wait for him to come to me, I&rsquo;ll fall on my face</em>. It was
hard to keep his knees straight as he started forward. <em>Luck,
stay with me</em>.</p>

<p>From the first blow, he knew that luck, or skill, or
whatever had brought him this far, was still there. Galad managed
to turn that one with a sharp clack, and the next, and the next,
and the next, but strain stiffened his face. That smooth swordsman,
almost as good as the Warders, fought with every ounce of his skill
to keep Mat&rsquo;s staff from him. He did not attack; it was all he
could do to defend. He moved continually to the side, trying not to
be forced back, and Mat pressed him, staff a blur. And Galad
stepped back, stepped back again, wooden blade a thin shield
against the quarterstaff.</p>

<p>Hunger gnawed at Mat as if he had swallowed weasels.
Sweat rolled down into his eyes, and his strength began to fade as
if it leached out with the sweat. <em>Not yet. I can&rsquo;t fall yet. I
have to win. Now</em>. With a roar, he threw all his reserves into
one last surge.</p>

<p>The quarterstaff flickered past Galad&rsquo;s sword and in
quick succession struck knee, wrist, and ribs and finally thrust
into Galad&rsquo;s stomach like a spear. With a groan, Galad folded over,
fighting not to fall. The staff quivered in Mat&rsquo;s hands, on the
point of a final crushing thrust to the throat. Galad sank to the
ground.</p>

<p>Mat almost dropped the quarterstaff when he realized
what he had been about to do. <em>Win, not kill. Light, what was I
thinking?</em> Reflexively he grounded the butt of the staff, and
as soon he did, he had to clutch at it to hold himself erect.
Hunger hollowed him like a knife reaming marrow from a bone.
Suddenly he realized that not only the Aes Sedai and Accepted were
watching. All practice, all learning, had stopped. Warders and
students alike stood watching him.</p>

<p>Hammar moved to stand beside Galad, still groaning on
the ground and trying to push himself up. The Warder raised his
voice to shout, &ldquo;Who was the greatest blademaster of all time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the throats of dozens of students came a massed
bellow. &ldquo;Jearom, Gaidin!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Hammar shouted, turning to make sure all
heard. &ldquo;During his lifetime, Jearom fought over ten thousand times,
in battle and single combat. He was defeated once. By a farmer with
a quarterstaff. Remember that. Remember what you just saw.&rdquo; He
lowered his eyes to Galad, and lowered his voice as well. &ldquo;If you
cannot get up by now, lad, it is finished.&rdquo; He raised a hand, and
the Aes Sedai and Accepted rushed to surround Galad.</p>

<p>Mat slid down the staff to his knees. None of the Aes
Sedai even glanced his way. One of the Accepted did, a plump girl
he might have liked to ask for a dance if she were not going to be
an Aes Sedai. She frowned at him, sniffed, and turned back to
peering at what the Aes Sedai were doing around Galad.</p>

<p>Gawyn was on his feet, Mat noted with relief. He
pulled himself up as Gawyn came over. <em>Mustn&rsquo;t let them know.
I&rsquo;ll never get out of here if they decide to nurse me from sunup to
sunup</em>. Blood darkened the red-gold hair on the side of Gawyn&rsquo;s
head, but there was neither cut nor bruise apparent.</p>

<p>He pushed two silver marks into Mat&rsquo;s hand with a
dry, &ldquo;I think I will listen next time.&rdquo; He noticed Mat&rsquo;s glance,
touched his head. &ldquo;They Healed it, but it was not bad. Elayne has
given me worse more than once. You are good with that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not as good as my da. He&rsquo;s won the quarterstaff at
Bel Tine every year as long as I can remember, except once or twice
when Rand&rsquo;s da did.&rdquo; That interested look came back into Gawyn&rsquo;s
eyes, and Mat wished he had never mentioned Tam al&rsquo;Thor. The Aes
Sedai and the Accepted were all still clustered around Galad. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I must have hurt him badly. I did not mean to do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gawyn glanced that way&mdash;there was nothing to be seen
but two rings of women&rsquo;s backs, Accepted&rsquo;s white dresses making the
outer ring as they peered over the shoulders of crouching Aes Sedai&mdash;and laughed. &ldquo;You did not kill him&mdash;I heard him
groaning&mdash;so he should be on his feet by now, but they are
not going to let this chance pass, now they have their hands on
him. Light, four of them are Green Ajah!&rdquo; Mat gave him a confused
look&mdash;<em>Green Ajah? What does that have to do with
anything?</em>&mdash;and Gawyn shook his head. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter.
Just rest assured that the worst Galad has to worry about is
finding himself Warder to a Green Aes Sedai before his head
clears.&rdquo; He laughed. &ldquo;No, they would not do that. But I will wager
you those two marks of mine in your hand that some of them wish
they could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not your marks,&rdquo; Mat said, shoving them in his coat
pocket, &ldquo;mine.&rdquo; The explanation had made little sense to him.
Except that Galad was well. All he knew of what passed between
Warders and Aes Sedai were the pieces he remembered of Lan and
Moiraine, and there was nothing there like what Gawyn seemed to be
suggesting. &ldquo;Do you think they&rsquo;d mind if I collected my wager from
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They very likely would,&rdquo; Hammar said dryly as he
joined them. &ldquo;You are not very popular with those particular Aes
Sedai right now.&rdquo; He snorted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d think even Green Aes Sedai
would be better than girls just loose from their mother&rsquo;s apron
strings. He isn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> good-looking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is not,&rdquo; Mat agreed.</p>

<p>Gawyn grinned at both of them, until Hammar glared at
him. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; the Warder said, pushing two more silver coins into
Mat&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I will collect from Galad later. Where are you from,
lad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Manetheren.&rdquo; Mat froze when he heard the name come
out of his mouth. &ldquo;I mean, I&rsquo;m from the Two Rivers. I have heard
too many old stories.&rdquo; They just looked at him without saying
anything. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I think I will go back and see if I can find
something to eat.&rdquo; Not even the Midmorning bell had rung yet, but
they nodded as if it made sense.</p>

<p>He kept the quarterstaff&mdash;no one had told him
to put it back&mdash;and walked slowly until the trees hid him
from the practice yard. When they did, he leaned on the staff as
though it were the only thing holding him up. He was not sure it
was not.</p>

<p>He thought that if he parted his coat, he would see a
hole where his stomach should have been, a hole growing larger as
it pulled the rest of him in. But he hardly thought of hunger. He
kept hearing voices in his head. <em>You speak the Old Tongue, lad?
Manetheren</em>. It made him shiver. <em>Light help me, I keep
digging myself deeper. I have to get out of here. But how?</em> He
hobbled back toward the Tower proper like an old, old man. <em>
How?</em></p>
