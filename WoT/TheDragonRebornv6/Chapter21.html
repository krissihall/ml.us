<h4><em>A World of Dreams</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">E</span>gwene
scrubbed her hands with a hand towel as she
hurried down the dimly lit corridor. She had washed them twice, but
they still felt greasy. She had not thought there could be so many
pots in the world. And today had been bake day, so buckets of ashes
had had to be hauled from the ovens. And the hearths cleaned. And
the tables rubbed bone-white with fine sand, and the floors
scrubbed on hands and knees. Ash and grease stained her white
dress. Her back ached, and she wanted to be in her bed, but Verin
had come to the kitchens, supposedly for a meal to eat in her
rooms, and whispered a summons to her in passing.</p>

<p>Verin had her quarters above the library, in
corridors used only by a few other Brown sisters. There was a dusty
air to the halls there, as if the women who lived along them were
too busy with other things to bother having the servants clean very
often, and the passages took odd turns and twists, sometimes
dipping or rising unexpectedly. The tapestries were few, their
colorful weavings dulled, apparently cleaned as seldom as
everything else here. Many of the lamps were unlit, plunging much
of the hall into gloom. Egwene thought she had it to herself,
except for a flash of white ahead, perhaps a novice or a servant
scurrying about some task. Her shoes, clicking on bare black and
white floor tiles, made echoes. It was not a comforting place for
one thinking of the Black Ajah.</p>

<p>She found what Verin had told her to look for. A dark
paneled door at the top of a rise, beside a dusty tapestry of a
king on horseback receiving the surrender of another king. Verin
had named the pair of them&mdash;men dead hundreds of years before
Artur Hawkwing was born; Verin always seemed to know such things&mdash;but Egwene could not remember their names, or the
long-vanished countries they had ruled. It was the only wall
hanging she had seen that matched Verin&rsquo;s description, though.</p>

<p>Minus the sound of her own footsteps, the hallway
seemed even emptier than before, and more threatening. She rapped
on the door, and entered hurriedly on the heels of an absentminded,
&ldquo;Who is it? Come in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One step into the room, she stopped and stared.
Shelves lined the walls, except for one door that must lead to
inner rooms and except for where maps hung, often in layers, and
what seemed to be charts of the night sky. She recognized the names
of some constellations&mdash;the Plowman and the Haywain, the
Archer and the Five Sisters&mdash;but others were unfamiliar.
Books and papers and scrolls covered nearly every flat surface,
with all sorts of odd things interspersed among the piles, and
sometimes on top of them. Strange shapes of glass or metal, spheres
and tubes interlinked, and circles held inside circles, stood among
bones and skulls of every shape and description. What appeared to
be a stuffed brown owl, not much bigger than Egwene&rsquo;s hand, stood
on what seemed to be a bleached white lizard&rsquo;s skull, but could not
be, for the skull was longer than her arm and had crooked teeth as
big as her fingers. Candlesticks had been stuck about in a
haphazard fashion, giving good light here and shadows there,
although seeming in danger of setting fire to papers in some
places. The owl blinked at her, and she jumped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; Verin said. She was seated behind a table
as cluttered as everything else in the room, a torn page held
carefully in her hands. &ldquo;It is you. Yes.&rdquo; She noticed Egwene&rsquo;s
sideways glance at the owl, and said absently, &ldquo;He keeps down mice.
They chew paper.&rdquo; Her gesture took in the entire room, and reminded
her of the page she held. &ldquo;Fascinating, this. Rosel of Essam
claimed more than a hundred pages survived the Breaking, and she
should have known, since she wrote barely two hundred years
afterwards, but only this one piece still exists, so far as I know.
Perhaps only this very copy. Rosel wrote that it held secrets the
world could not face, and she would not speak of them plainly. I
have read this page a thousand times, trying to decipher what she
meant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tiny owl blinked at Egwene again. She tried not
to look at it. &ldquo;What does it say, Verin Sedai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verin blinked, very much as the owl had. &ldquo;What does
it say? It is a direct translation, mind, and reads almost like a
bard reciting in High Chant. Listen. &lsquo;Heart of the Dark.
Ba&rsquo;alzamon. Name hidden within name shrouded by name. Secret buried
within secret cloaked by secret. Betrayer of Hope. Ishamael betrays
all hope. Truth burns and sears. Hope fails before truth. A lie is
our shield. Who can stand against the Heart of the Dark? Who can
face the Betrayer of Hope? Soul of shadow, Soul of the Shadow, he
is&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; She stopped with a sigh. &ldquo;It ends there. What do you
make of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Egwene said. &ldquo;I do not like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, why should you, child? Like it, or understand
it? I have studied it nearly forty years, and I do neither.&rdquo; Verin
carefully placed the page inside a silk-lined folder of stiff
leather, then casually stuffed the folder into a stack of papers.
&ldquo;But you did not come for that.&rdquo; She rummaged across the table,
muttering to herself, several times barely catching a pile of books
or manuscripts before it toppled. Finally she came up with a
handful of pages covered in a thin, spidery hand and tied with
nubby string. &ldquo;Here, child. Everything that is known about Liandrin
and the women who went with her. Names, ages, Ajahs, where they
were born. Everything I could find in the records. Even how they
performed in their studies. What we know of the <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em> they took, too, which isn&rsquo;t much. Only
descriptions, for the most part. I do not know whether any of this
will help. I saw nothing of any use in this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps one of us will see something.&rdquo; A sudden wave
of suspicion took Egwene by surprise. <em>If she didn&rsquo;t leave
something out</em>. The Amyrlin seemed to trust Verin only because
she had to. What if Verin was Black Ajah herself? She gave herself
a shake. She had traveled all the way from Toman Head to Tar Valon
with Verin, and she refused to believe this plump scholar could be
a Darkfriend. &ldquo;I trust you, Verin Sedai.&rdquo; <em>Can I,
really?</em></p>

<p>The Aes Sedai blinked at her again, then dismissed
whatever thought had come to her with a shade of her head. &ldquo;That
list I gave you may be important, or it may be so much waste of
paper, but it isn&rsquo;t the only reason I summoned you.&rdquo; She started
moving things on the table, making some shaky stacks taller to
clear a space. &ldquo;I understand from Anaiya that you might become a
Dreamer. The last was Corianin Nedeal, four hundred and
seventy-three years ago, and from what I can make of the records,
she barely deserved the name. It would be quite interesting, if you
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She tested me, Verin Sedai, but she couldn&rsquo;t be sure
that any of my dreams foretold the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is only part of what a Dreamer does, child.
Perhaps the least part. Anaiya believes in bringing girls along too
slowly, in my opinion. Look here.&rdquo; With one finger, Verin drew a
number of parallel lines across the area she had cleared, lines
clear in dust atop the old beeswax. &ldquo;Let these represent worlds
that might exist if different choices had been made, if major
turning points in the Pattern had gone another way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The worlds reached by the Portal Stones,&rdquo; Egwene
said, to show she had listened to Verin&rsquo;s lectures on the journey
from Toman Head. What could this possibly have to do with whether
or not she was a Dreamer?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good. But the Pattern may be even more complex
than that, child. The Wheel weaves our lives to make the Pattern of
an Age, but the Ages themselves are woven into the Age Lace, the
Great Pattern. Who can know if this is even the tenth part of the
weaving, though? Some in the Age of Legends apparently believe that
there were still other worlds&mdash;even harder to reach than the
worlds of the Portal Stones, if that can be believed&mdash;lying
like this.&rdquo; She drew more lines, cross-hatching the first set. For
a moment she stared at them. &ldquo;The warp and the woof of the weave.
Perhaps the Wheel of Time weaves a still greater Pattern from
worlds.&rdquo; Straightening, she dusted her hands. &ldquo;Well, that is
neither here nor there. In all of these worlds, whatever their
other variations, a few things are constant. One is that the Dark
One is imprisoned in all of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In spite of herself, Egwene stepped closer to peer at
the lines Verin had drawn. &ldquo;In all of them? How can that be? Are
you saying there is a Father of Lies for each world?&rdquo; The thought
of so many Dark Ones made her shiver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, child. There is one Creator, who exists
everywhere at once for all of these worlds. In the same way, there
is only one Dark One, who also exists in all of these worlds at
once. If he is freed from the prison the Creator made in one world,
he is freed on all. So long as he is kept prisoner in one, he
remains imprisoned on all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That does not seem to make sense,&rdquo; Egwene
protested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paradox, child. The Dark One is the embodiment of
paradox and chaos, the destroyer of reason and logic, the breaker
of balance, the unmaker of order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The owl suddenly took flight on silent wings, landing
atop a large white skull on a shelf behind the Aes Sedai. It peered
down at the two women, blinking. Egwene had noticed the skull when
she came in, with its curled horns and snout, and vaguely wondered
what sort of ram had so big a head. Now she took in the roundness
of it, the high forehead. Not a ram&rsquo;s skull. A Trolloc.</p>

<p>She drew a shuddering breath. &ldquo;Verin Sedai, what does
this have to do with being a Dreamer? The Dark One is bound in
Shayol Ghul, and I do not want to even think of him escaping.&rdquo; <em>
But the seals on his prison are weakening. Even novices know that,
now</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do with being a Dreamer? Why, nothing, child. Except
that we must all confront the Dark One in one way or another. He is
prisoned now, but the Pattern did not bring Rand al&rsquo;Thor into the
world for no purpose. The Dragon Reborn will face the Lord of the
Grave; that much is sure. If Rand survives that long, of course.
The Dark One will try to distort the Pattern, if he can. Well, we
have gone rather far afield, haven&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, Verin Sedai, but if this&rdquo;&mdash;Egwene
indicated the lines drawn in the dust&mdash;&ldquo;has nothing to do
with being a Dreamer, why are you telling me about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verin stared at her as if she were deliberately being
dense. &ldquo;Nothing? Of course it has something to do with it, child.
The point is that there is a third constant besides the Creator and
the Dark One. There is a world that lies <em>within</em> each of
these others, inside all of them at the same time. Or perhaps
surrounding them. Writers in the Age of Legends called it <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, &ldquo;the Unseen World.&rdquo; Perhaps &ldquo;the World of
Dreams&rdquo; is a better translation. Many people&mdash;ordinary folk
who could not think of channeling&mdash;sometimes glimpse
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod in their dreams, and even catch glimmers of these
other worlds through it. Think of some of the peculiar things you
have seen in your dreams. But a Dreamer, child&mdash;a true
Dreamer&mdash;can enter <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene tried to swallow, but a lump in her throat
stopped her. <em>Enter it?</em> &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think I am a
Dreamer, Verin Sedai. Anaiya Sedai&rsquo;s tests&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verin cut her off. &ldquo;&mdash;prove nothing one way or
the other. And Anaiya still believes that you may very well be
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I will learn whether I am or not
eventually,&rdquo; Egwene mumbled. <em>Light, I want to be, don&rsquo;t I? I
want to learn! I want it all</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have no time to wait, child. The Amyrlin has
entrusted a great task to you and Nynaeve. You must reach out for
any tool you might be able to use.&rdquo; Verin dug a red wooden box from
under the welter on her table. The box was large enough to hold
sheets of paper, but when the Aes Sedai opened the lid a crack, all
she pulled out was a ring carved from stone, all flecks and stripes
of blue and brown and red, and too large to be a finger ring.
&ldquo;Here, child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene shifted the papers to take it, and her eyes
widened in surprise. The ring certainly looked like stone, but it
felt harder than steel and heavier than lead. And the circle of it
was twisted. If she ran a finger along one edge, it would go around
twice, inside as well as out; it only had one edge. She moved her
finger along that edge twice, just to convince herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Corianin Nedeal,&rdquo; Verin said, &ldquo;had that <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em> in her possession for most of her life. You will
keep it, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene almost dropped the ring. A <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em>? <em>I am to keep a</em> ter&rsquo;angreal<em>?</em></p>

<p>Verin seemed not to notice her shock. &ldquo;According to
her, it eases the passage to <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. She claimed
it would work for those without Talent as well as for Aes Sedai, so
long as you are touching it when you sleep. There are dangers, of
course. Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod is not like other dreams. What happens there
is real; you are actually there instead of just glimpsing it.&rdquo; She
pushed back the sleeve of her dress, revealing a faded scar the
length of her forearm. &ldquo;I tried it myself, once, some years ago.
Anaiya&rsquo;s Healing did not work as well as it should have. Remember
that.&rdquo; The Aes Sedai let her sleeve cover the scar again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will be careful, Verin Sedai.&rdquo; <em>Real? My dreams
are bad enough as they are. I want no dreams that leave scars! I&rsquo;ll
put it in a sack and stick it in a dark corner and leave it there.
I&rsquo;ll</em>&mdash;But she wanted to learn. She wanted to be Aes
Sedai, and no Aes Sedai had been a Dreamer in nearly five hundred
years. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be very careful.&rdquo; She slipped the ring into her pouch
and tugged the drawstrings tight, then picked up the papers Verin
had given her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember to keep it hidden, child. No novice, or
even an Accepted, should have a thing like that in her possession.
But it may prove useful to you. Keep it hidden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Verin Sedai.&rdquo; Remembering Verin&rsquo;s scar, she
almost wished another Aes Sedai would come along and take it from
her right then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good, child. Now, off with you. It grows late, and
you must be up early to help with breakfast. Sleep well.&rdquo;</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Verin sat looking at the door for a time after it
closed behind Egwene. The owl hooted softly behind her. Pulling the
red box to her, she opened the lid all the way and frowned at what
nearly filled the space.</p>

<p>Page upon page, covered with a precise hand, the
black ink barely faded after nearly five hundred years. Corianin
Nedeal&rsquo;s notes, everything she had learned in fifty years of
studying that peculiar <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. A secretive woman,
Corianin. She had kept by far the greater part of her knowledge
from everyone, trusting it only to these pages. Only chance and a
habit of rummaging through old papers in the library had led Verin
to them. As far as she could discover, no Aes Sedai besides herself
knew of the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>; Corianin had managed to erase its
existence from the records.</p>

<p>Once again she considered burning the manuscript,
just as she had considered giving it to Egwene. But destroying
knowledge, any knowledge, was anathema to her. And for the other&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>No. It is best by far to leave things as they are. What
will happen, will happen</em>. She let the lid drop shut. <em>Now
where did I put that page?</em></p>

<p>Frowning, she began to search the stacks of books and
papers for the leather folder. Egwene was already out of her
mind.</p>
