<h4><em>The Way Out of the Mountains</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
way down out of the mountains was hard, but the
lower they went, the less Perrin needed his fur-lined cloak. Hour
by hour, they rode out of the tailings of winter and into the first
days of spring. The last remnants of snow vanished, and grasses and
wildflowers&mdash;white maiden&rsquo;s hope and pink jump up&mdash;began to cover the high meadows they crossed. Trees appeared more
often, with more leaves, and grasslarks and robins sang in the
branches. And there were wolves. Never in sight&mdash;not even Lan
mentioned seeing one&mdash;but Perrin knew. He kept his mind
firmly closed to them, yet now and again a feather-light tickle at
the back of his mind reminded him they were there.</p>

<p>Lan spent most of his time scouting their path on his
black warhorse, Mandarb, following Rand&rsquo;s tracks as the rest of
them followed the signs the Warder left for them. An arrow of
stones laid out on the ground, or one lightly scratched in the rock
wall of a forking pass. Turn this way. Cross that saddle-pass. Take
this switchback, this deer trail, this way through the trees and
down along a narrow stream, even though there is nothing to
indicate anyone has ever gone that way before. Nothing but Lan&rsquo;s
signs. A tuft of grass or weeds tied one way to say bear left,
another for bear right. A bent branch. A pile of pebbles for a
rough climb ahead, two leaves caught on a thorn for a steep
descent. The Warder had a hundred signs, it seemed to Perrin, and
Moiraine knew them all. Lan rarely came back except when they made
camp, to confer with Moiraine quietly, away from the fire. When the
sun rose, most often he was hours gone already.</p>

<p>Moiraine was always first into the saddle after him,
while the eastern sky was just turning pink. The Aes Sedai would
not have climbed down from Aldieb, her white mare, until full dark
or later, except that Lan refused to track further once the light
began to fail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go even slower if a horse breaks a leg,&rdquo; the
Warder would tell Moiraine when she complained.</p>

<p>Her reply was always very much the same. &ldquo;If you
cannot move any faster than this, perhaps I should send you off to
Myrelle before you get any older. Well, perhaps that can wait, but
you must move us faster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She half sounded as if the threat were irritated
truth, half as if she were making a joke. There was something of a
threat in it, or maybe a warning, Perrin was sure, from the way
Lan&rsquo;s mouth tightened even when she smiled afterwards and reached
up to pat his shoulder soothingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is Myrelle?&rdquo; Perrin asked suspiciously, the
first time it happened. Loial shook his head, murmuring something
about unpleasant things happening to those who pried into Aes Sedai
affairs. The Ogier&rsquo;s hairy-fetlocked horse was as tall and heavy as
a Dhurran stallion, but with Loial&rsquo;s long legs dangling to either
side, the animal looked undersized, like a large pony.</p>

<p>Moiraine gave an amused, secretive smile. &ldquo;Just a
Green sister. Someone to whom Lan must one day deliver a package
for safekeeping.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No day soon,&rdquo; Lan said, and surprisingly, there was
open anger in his voice. &ldquo;Never, if I can help it. You will outlive
me long, Moiraine Aes Sedai!&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>She has too many secrets</em>, Perrin thought,
but asked no more about a subject that could crack the Warder&rsquo;s
iron self-control.</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai had a blanket-wrapped bundle tied
behind her saddle: the Dragon banner. Perrin was uneasy about
having it with them, but Moiraine had neither asked his opinion nor
listened when he offered it. Not that anyone was likely to
recognize it if they saw it, yet he hoped she was as good at
keeping secrets from other people as she was at keeping them from
him.</p>

<p>In the beginning, at least, it was a boring journey.
One cloud-capped mountain was very much like another, one pass
little different from the next. Supper was usually rabbit, dropped
by stones from Perrin&rsquo;s sling. He did not have so many arrows as to
risk shooting at rabbits in that rocky country. Breakfast was cold
rabbit, more often than not, and the midday meal the same, eaten in
the saddle.</p>

<p>Sometimes when they camped near a stream and there
was still light enough to see, he and Loial caught mountain trout,
lying on their bellies, hands elbow-deep in the cold water,
tickling the green-backed fish out from under the rock ledges where
they hid. Loial&rsquo;s fingers, big as they were, were even more deft at
it than Perrin&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Once, three days after setting out, Moiraine joined
them, stretching herself out on the streamside and undoing rows of
pearl buttons to roll up her sleeves as she asked how the thing was
done. Perrin exchanged surprised looks with Loial. The Ogier
shrugged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not that hard, really,&rdquo; Perrin told her. &ldquo;Just
bring your hand up from behind the fish, and underneath, as if
you&rsquo;re trying to tickle its belly. Then you pull it out. It takes
practice, though. You might not catch anything the first few times
you try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tried for days before I ever caught anything,&rdquo;
Loial added. He was already easing his huge hands into the water,
careful to keep his shadow from scaring the fish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As difficult as that?&rdquo; Moiraine murmured. Her hands
slipped into the water&mdash;and a moment later came out with a
splash, holding a fat trout that thrashed the surface. She laughed
with delight as she tossed it up onto the bank.</p>

<p>Perrin blinked at the big fish flopping in the fading
sunlight. It must have weighed at least five pounds. &ldquo;You were very
lucky,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Trout that size don&rsquo;t often shelter under a ledge
this small. We&rsquo;ll have to move upstream a bit. It will be dark
before any of them settle under this ledge again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;You two go ahead. I
think I will just try here again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin hesitated a moment before moving up the bank
to another overhang. She was up to something, but he could not
imagine what. That troubled him. Belly down, and careful not to let
his shadow fall on the water, he peered over the edge. Half a dozen
slender shapes hung suspended in the water, barely moving a fin to
hold their places. All of them together would not weigh as much as
Moiraine&rsquo;s fish, he decided with a sigh. If they were lucky, he and
Loial might take two apiece, but the shadows of trees on the far
bank already stretched across the water. Whatever they caught now
would be it, and Loial&rsquo;s appetite was big enough by itself to
swallow those four and most of the bigger fish, too. Loial&rsquo;s hands
were already easing up behind one of the trout.</p>

<p>Before Perrin could even slide his hands into the
water, Moiraine gave a shout. &ldquo;Three should be enough, I think. The
last two are bigger than the first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin gave Loial a startled look. &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t
have!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Ogier straightened, sending the small trout
scattering. &ldquo;She is Aes Sedai,&rdquo; he said simply.</p>

<p>Sure enough, when they returned to Moiraine, three
big trout lay on the bank. She was already buttoning her sleeves up
again.</p>

<p>Perrin thought about reminding her that whoever took
the fish was supposed to clean them, too, but just at that moment
she caught his eye. There was no particular expression on her
smooth face, but her dark eyes did not waver, and they appeared to
know what he was going to say, and to have dismissed it out of hand
already. When she turned away, it seemed somehow too late to say
anything.</p>

<p>Muttering to himself, Perrin pulled out his belt
knife and set to the scaling and gutting. &ldquo;All of a sudden she&rsquo;s
forgotten about sharing the chores, it seems. I suppose she&rsquo;ll want
us to do the cooking, as well, and the cleaning up after.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt she will,&rdquo; Loial said without pausing over
the fish he was working on. &ldquo;She is Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I seem to remember hearing that somewhere.&rdquo; Perrin&rsquo;s
knife made fish scales fly. &ldquo;The Shienarans might have been willing
to run around fetching and carrying for her, but there are only
four of us now. We should keep on turn and turn about. It&rsquo;s only
fair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial gave a great snort of laughter. &ldquo;I doubt she
sees it that way. First she had to put up with Rand arguing with
her all the time, and now you&rsquo;re ready to take over for him. As a
rule, Aes Sedai do not let anyone argue with them. I expect she
means to have us back in the habit of doing what she says by the
time we reach the first village.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good habit to be in,&rdquo; Lan said, throwing back his
cloak. In the fading light he had appeared out of nowhere.</p>

<p>Perrin nearly fell over from surprise, and Loial&rsquo;s
ears went stiff with shock. Neither of them had heard the Warder&rsquo;s
step.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A habit you should never have lost,&rdquo; Lan added, then
strode off toward Moiraine and the horses. His boots barely made a
sound, even on that rocky ground, and once he was a few paces away
the cloak hanging down his back gave him the uneasy appearance of a
disembodied head and arms drifting up from the stream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We need her to find Rand,&rdquo; Perrin said softly, &ldquo;but
I am not going to let her shape my life anymore.&rdquo; He went back to
his scaling vigorously.</p>

<p>He meant to keep that promise&mdash;he really did&mdash;but during the days that followed, in some way he did not
quite understand, he found that he and Loial were doing the
cooking, and the cleaning up, and any other little chore that
Moiraine thought of. He even discovered that somehow or other he
had taken over tending Aldieb every night, unsaddling the mare and
rubbing her down while Moiraine settled herself, apparently deep in
thought.</p>

<p>Loial gave in to it as inevitable, but not Perrin. He
tried refusing, resisting, but it was hard to resist when she made
a reasonable suggestion, and a small one at that. Only there was
always another suggestion behind it, as reasonable and small as the
first, and then another. The simple force of her presence, the
strength of her gaze, made it difficult to protest. Her dark eyes
would catch his at the moment he opened his mouth. A lift of her
eyebrow to suggest he was being rude, a surprised widening of her
eyes that he could object to so small a request, a level stare that
held in it everything that was Aes Sedai, all these things could
make him hesitate, and once he hesitated there was never any
recovering lost ground. He accused her of using the One Power on
him, though he did not really think that was it, and she told him
not to be a fool. He began to feel like a piece of iron trying to
stop a smith from hammering it into a scythe.</p>

<p>The Mountains of Mist gave way abruptly to the
forested foothills of Ghealdan, to land that seemed all up and
down, but never very high. Deer, which in the mountains had often
watched them warily, as if uncertain what a man was, began to bound
away, white tails flickering, at the first sight of the horses.
Even Perrin now caught only the faintest glimpses of the
gray-striped mountain cats that seemed to fade away like smoke.
They were coming into the lands of men.</p>

<p>Lan stopped wearing his color-shifting cloak and
began riding back to the rest of them more often, telling them what
lay ahead. In many places the trees had all been cut down. Soon,
fields encircled by rough stone walls and farmers plowing &rsquo;round
the sides of hills were common sights, if not exactly frequent,
along with lines of people moving across the plowed ground, sowing
seed from sacks slung from their shoulders. Scattered farmhouses
and barns of gray stone sat on hilltops and ridges.</p>

<p>The wolves should not have been there. Wolves avoided
places where men were, but Perrin could still sense them, an unseen
screen and escort ringing the mounted party. Impatience filled him;
impatience to reach a village or a town, any place where there were
enough men to make the wolves go away.</p>

<p>A day after sighting the first field, just as the sun
touched the horizon behind them, they came to the village of Jarra,
not far north of the border with Amadicia.</p>
