Nynaeve and the others left him, Mat spent most
of the day in his room, except for one brief excursion. He was
planning. And eating. He ate nearly everything the serving women
brought him, and asked for more. They were more than happy to
oblige. It was bread and cheese and fruit he asked for, and he
piled winter-wrinkled apples and pears, wedges of cheese and loaves
of bread inside the wardrobe, leaving empty trays for them to take
away.</p>

<p>At midday he had to endure a visit from an Aes Sedai&mdash;Anaiya, he seemed to remember her name was. She put her
hands on his head and sent cold chills through him. It was the One
Power, he decided, not simply being touched by an Aes Sedai. She
was a plain woman despite her smooth cheeks and Aes Sedai
serenity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem much better,&rdquo; she told him, smiling. Her
smile made him think of his mother. &ldquo;Even hungrier than I expected,
so I hear, but better. I am informed you are trying to eat the
larders bare. Believe me when I say we will see you have all the
food you need. You do not have to worry that we&rsquo;ll let you miss a
meal before you are fully well again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave the grin he used on his mother when he
especially wanted her to believe him. &ldquo;I know you won&rsquo;t. And I do
feel better. I thought I might see some of the city this afternoon.
If you have no objections, of course. Maybe visit an inn tonight.
There&rsquo;s nothing like a night of common-room talk to pick one&rsquo;s
spirits up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He thought her lips twitched on the edge of a bigger
smile. &ldquo;No one will try to stop you, Mat. But do not try to leave
the city. It will only upset the guards, and bring you nothing but
a trip back here under escort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not do that, Aes Sedai. The Amyrlin Seat
said I&rsquo;d starve to death in a few days if I left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She nodded as if she did not believe a word he said.
&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; As she turned from him, her eyes fell on the
quarterstaff he had brought from the practice yard, propped in the
corner of the room. &ldquo;You do not need to protect yourself from us,
Mat. You are as safe here as you could be anywhere. Almost
certainly safer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know that, Aes Sedai. I do.&rdquo; After she left he
frowned at the door, wondering if he had managed to convince her of
anything.</p>

<p>It was more evening than afternoon when he left the
room for what he hoped was the final time. The sky was purpling,
and the setting sun painted clouds to the west in shades of red.
Once he had his cloak around him, and the big leather script he had
found on his one earlier foray dangling from his shoulder and
bulging with the bread and cheese and fruit he had squirreled away,
one look in the mirror told him there was no hiding what he
intended. He tied the rest of his clothes up in a roll with the
blanket from the bed and slung that across his shoulders, too. The
quarterstaff did for a walking staff. He left nothing behind. His
coat pockets held all his smaller belongings, and his belt pouch
held the most important. The Amyrlin Seat&rsquo;s paper. Elayne&rsquo;s letter.
And his dice cups.</p>

<p>He saw Aes Sedai as he made his way out of the Tower,
and some of them noticed him, though most merely flickered an
eyebrow, and none spoke to him. Anaiya was one. She gave him an
amused smile and a rueful shake of her head. He returned a shrug
and the guiltiest grin he could manage, and she went silently on,
still shaking her head. The guards at the Tower gates simply looked
at him.</p>

<p>It was not until he was across the big square and
into the streets of the city that relief finally surged up in him.
And triumph. <em>If you can&rsquo;t hide what you are going to do, do it
so everybody thinks you are a fool. Then they stand around waiting
to see you fall on your face. Those Aes Sedai will be waiting for
the guards to bring me back. When I do not return by morning, then
they&rsquo;ll start a search. Not too frantic at first, because they&rsquo;ll
think I have gone to ground somewhere in the city. By the time they
realize I haven&rsquo;t, this rabbit will be a long way downriver from
the hounds</em>.</p>

<p>With as light a heart as he could remember having in
years, or so it seemed, he began to hum &ldquo;We&rsquo;re Over the Border
Again,&rdquo; heading toward the harbor where vessels would be sailing
down to Tear and all the villages along the Erinin between. He
would not be going so far as that, of course. Aringill, where he
would take to land again for the rest of the trip to Caemlyn, was
only halfway downriver.</p>

<p><em>I&rsquo;ll deliver your bloody letter. The nerve of
her, thinking I&rsquo;d say I would, then not. I will deliver the bloody
thing if it kills me</em>.</p>

<p>Twilight was beginning to cover Tar Valon, but there
was still enough light to grace the fantastical buildings, and the
oddly shaped towers connected by high bridges spanning open air
over hundred-pace drops. People yet filled the streets, in so many
different kinds of clothing that he thought every nation must be
represented. Along the major avenues, pairs of lamplighters used
their ladders to light lanterns atop tall poles. But in the part of
Tar Valon he sought, the only light was what spilled from
windows.</p>

<p>Ogier had built the great buildings and towers of Tar
Valon, but other, newer parts had grown under the hands of men.
Newer meaning two thousand years in some cases. Down near
Southharbor, men&rsquo;s hands had tried to match, if not duplicate, the
fanciful Ogier work. Inns where ships&rsquo; crews caroused bore enough
stonework for palaces. Statues in niches and cupolas on rooftops,
ornately worked cornices and intricately carved friezes, all
decorated chandlers&rsquo; shops and merchant houses. Bridges arched
across the streets here, too, but the streets were cobblestone, not
great paving blocks, and many of the bridges were wood instead of
stone, sometimes as low as the second stories of the buildings they
joined, and never higher than four.</p>

<p>The dark streets hummed with as much life as any in
Tar Valon. Traders off their vessels and those who bought what the
vessels carried, people who traveled the River Erinin and people
who worked it, all filled the taverns and the common rooms of the
inns, in company with those who sought the money such folk carried,
by fair means or murky. Raucous music filled the streets from
bittern and flute, harp and hammered dulcimer. The first inn Mat
entered had three dice games in progress, men crouched in circles
near the common-room walls and shouting the wins and losses.</p>

<p>He only meant to gamble an hour or so before finding
a ship, just long enough to add a few coins to his purse, but he
won. He had always won more than he lost, as far as he could
remember, and there had been times with Hurin, and in Shienar, when
six of eight tosses in a row won for him. Tonight, every toss won.
Every toss.</p>

<p>From the looks some of the men gave him, he was glad
he had left his own dice in his pouch. Those looks made him decide
to move on. With surprise he realized that he had nearly thirty
silver marks in his purse now, but he had not won so much from any
one man that they would not all be glad to see him go.</p>

<p>Except for one dark sailor with tight curls&mdash;one of the Sea Folk, someone had said, though Mat wondered what one
of the Atha&rsquo;an Miere was doing so far from the sea&mdash;who
followed him down the darkened street, arguing for a chance to make
good his losses. He wanted to reach the docks&mdash;thirty silver
marks was more than enough&mdash;but the sailor argued on, and he
had only used half his hour, so he gave in, and with the man
entered the next tavern they passed.</p>

<p>He won again, and it was as if a fever gripped him.
He won every throw. From tavern to inn to tavern he went, never
staying long enough to anger anyone with the amount of his
winnings. And he still won every toss. He exchanged silver for gold
with a money changer. He played at crowns, and fives, and maiden&rsquo;s
ruin. He played games with five dice, and with four, and three, and
even only two. He played games he did not know before he squatted
in the circle, or took a place at the table. And he won. Somewhere
during the night, the dark sailor&mdash;Raab, he had said his name
was&mdash;staggered away, exhausted but with a full purse; he had
decided to put his wagers on Mat. Mat visited another money changer&mdash;or perhaps two; the fever seemed to cloud his brain as badly
as his memories of the past were clouded&mdash;and made his way to
another game. Winning.</p>

<p>And so he found himself, he did not know how many
hours later, in a tavern filled with tabac smoke&mdash;The
Tremalking Splice, he thought it was called&mdash;staring down at
five dice, each showing a deeply carved crown. Most of the patrons
here seemed interested only in drinking as much as they could, but
the rattle of dice and shouts of players from another game in the
far corner were almost submerged by a woman singing to a quick tune
from a hammered dulcimer.</p>

<p class="verse_quote">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll dance with a girl with eyes of brown,<br>
or a girl with eyes of green,<br>
I&rsquo;ll dance with a girl with any color eyes,<br>
but yours are the prettiest I&rsquo;ve seen.<br>
I&rsquo;ll kiss a girl with hair of black,<br>
or a girl with hair of gold,<br>
I&rsquo;ll kiss a girl with any color hair,<br>
but it&rsquo;s you I want to hold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The singer had named the song as &ldquo;What He Said to
Me.&rdquo; Mat remembered the tune as &ldquo;Will You Dance With Me,&rdquo; with
different words, but at that moment all he could think of were
those dice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The king again,&rdquo; one of the men squatting with Mat
muttered. It was the fifth time in a row Mat had thrown the
king.</p>

<p>He had won the bet of a gold mark, not even caring by
this time that his Andoran mark outweighed the other man&rsquo;s Illianer
coin, but he scooped the dice into the leather cup, rattled it
hard, and spun them across the floor again. Five crowns. <em>Light,
it can&rsquo;t be. Nobody ever threw the king six times running.
Nobody</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Dark One&rsquo;s own luck,&rdquo; another man growled. He
was a bulky fellow, his dark hair tied at the nape of his neck with
a black ribbon, with heavy shoulders, scars on his face, and a nose
that had been broken more than once.</p>

<p>Mat was scarcely aware of moving before he had the
bulky man by the collar, hauling him to his feet, slamming him back
against the wall. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you say that!&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever
say that!&rdquo; The man blinked down at him in astonishment; he was a
full head taller than Mat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a saying,&rdquo; somebody behind him was muttering.
&ldquo;Light, it&rsquo;s just a saying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat released his grip on the scar-faced man&rsquo;s coat
and backed away. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t like anybody saying
things like that about me. I&rsquo;m no Darkfriend!&rdquo; <em>Burn me, not the
Dark One&rsquo;s luck. Not that! Oh, Light, did that bloody dagger really
do something to me?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody said you was,&rdquo; the broken-nosed man muttered.
He seemed to be getting over his surprise, and trying to decide
whether to be angry.</p>

<p>Gathering his belongings from where he had piled them
behind him, Mat walked out of the tavern, leaving the coins where
they lay. It was not that he was afraid of the big man. He had
forgotten the man, and the coins, too. All he wanted was to be
outside, in fresh air, where he could think.</p>

<p>In the street, he leaned against the wall of the
tavern not far from the door, breathing the coolness in. The dark
streets of Southharbor were all but empty, now. Music and laughter
still floated from the inns and taverns, but few people made their
way through the night. Holding the quarterstaff upright in front of
him with both hands, he lowered his head to his fists and tried to
think at the puzzle from every side.</p>

<p>He knew he was lucky. He could remember always being
lucky. But somehow, his memories from Emond&rsquo;s Field did not show
him as lucky as he had been since leaving. Certainly he had gotten
away with a great deal, but he could remember also being caught in
pranks he had been sure would succeed. His mother had always seemed
to know what he was up to, and Nynaeve able to see through whatever
defenses he put up. But it was not just since leaving the Two
Rivers that he had become lucky. The luck had come once he took the
dagger from Shadar Logoth. He remembered playing at dice back home,
with a sharp-eyed, skinny man who worked for a merchant come down
from Baerlon to buy tabac. He remembered the strapping his father
had given him, too, on learning Mat owed the man a silver mark and
four pence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m free of the bloody dagger,&rdquo; he mumbled.
&ldquo;Those bloody Aes Sedai said I was.&rdquo; He wondered how much he had
won tonight.</p>

<p>When he dug into his coat pockets, he found them
filled with loose coins, crowns and marks, both silver and gold
that glittered and glinted in the light from nearby windows. He had
two purses now, it seemed, and both fat. He undid the strings, and
found more gold. And still more stuffed into his belt pouch between
and around and on top of his dice cups, crumpling Elayne&rsquo;s letter
and the Amyrlin&rsquo;s paper. He had a memory of tossing silver pence to
serving girls because they had pretty smiles or pretty eyes or
pretty ankles, and because silver pence were not worth keeping.</p>

<p><em>Not worth keeping? Maybe they weren&rsquo;t. Light, I&rsquo;m
rich! I am bloody rich! Maybe it was something the Aes Sedai did.
Something they did Healing me. By accident, maybe. That could be
it. Better that the other. Those bloody Aes Sedai must have done it
to me</em>.</p>

<p>A big man moved out from the tavern, the door already
swinging shut to cut off the light that might have shown his
face.</p>

<p>Mat pressed his back close against the wall, stuffed
the purses back into his coat, and firmed his grip on the
quarterstaff. Wherever his luck tonight had come from, he did not
mean to lose all that gold to a footpad.</p>

<p>The man turned toward him, peered, then gave a start.
&ldquo;C-cool night,&rdquo; he said drunkenly. He staggered closer, and Mat saw
that most of his size was fat. &ldquo;I have to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I have to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;
Stumbling, the fat man moved on up the street, talking to himself
disjointedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; Mat muttered, but he was not sure whether he
meant it for the fat man or for himself. &ldquo;Time to find a ship to
take me away from here.&rdquo; He squinted at the black sky, trying to
estimate how long till dawn. Two, maybe three hours, he thought.
&ldquo;Past time.&rdquo; His stomach growled at him; he dimly recalled eating
in some of the inns, but he did not remember what. The fever of the
dice had had him by the throat. A hand pushed into the script found
only crumbs. &ldquo;Way past time. Or one of them will come pick me up
with her fingers and stick me in her pouch.&rdquo; He pushed away from
the wall and started for the docks, where the ships would be.</p>

<p>At first he thought the faint sounds behind him were
echoes of his boots on the cobblestones. Then he realized someone
was following him. And trying to be stealthy. <em>Well</em>, these <em>are
footpads, for sure</em>.</p>

<p>Hefting the quarterstaff, he briefly considered
turning to confront them. But it was dark, and the footing on
cobblestones uncertain, and he had no idea how many there were.
<em>Just because you did well against Gawyn and Galad doesn&rsquo;t make
you a bloody hero out of a story</em>.</p>

<p>He turned down a narrower, twisting side street,
trying to walk on tiptoe and move quickly at the same time. Every
window was dark here, and most shuttered. He was almost to the end
when he saw movement ahead, two men peering into the side street
from where it let out onto another. And he heard slow footsteps
behind him, soft scrapes of boot leather on stone.</p>

<p>In an instant he ducked into the shadowy corner where
one building stuck out further than the next. It seemed the best he
could do for the moment. Gripping the quarterstaff nervously, he
waited.</p>

<p>A man appeared from back the way he had come,
crouching as he eased himself ahead one slow step at a time, and
then another man. Each carried a knife in his hand and moved as if stalking.</p>

<p>Mat tensed. If they came just a few steps closer
before they noticed him hiding in the deeper shadows of the corner,
he could take them by surprise. He wished his stomach would stop
fluttering. Those knives were a great deal shorter than the
practice swords, but they were steel, not wood.</p>

<p>One of the men squinted toward the far end of the
narrow street and suddenly straightened, shouting, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he come
your way, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen nothing but the shadows,&rdquo; came the
answer in a heavy accent. &ldquo;I wish to be out of this. There are the
strange things moving this night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not four paces from Mat, the two men exchanged looks,
sheathed their knives, and trotted back the way they had come.</p>

<p>He let out a long, slow breath. <em>Luck. Burn me if
it&rsquo;s not good for more than dice</em>.</p>

<p>He could no longer see the men at the mouth of the
street, but he knew they were still out on the next street
somewhere. And more behind him the other way.</p>

<p>One of the buildings he was crouched against stood
only a single story high here, and the roof looked flat enough. And
a white stone frieze carved in huge grape leaves ran up the joining
of the two buildings.</p>

<p>Easing his quarterstaff up till one end rested on the
edge of the roof, he gave it a hard shove. It landed with a clatter
on the roof tiles. Not waiting to see if anyone had heard, he
scrambled up the frieze, the big leaves giving easy toeholds even
for a man in boots. In seconds he had the staff back in hand and
was trotting across the roof, trusting to luck for his footing.</p>

<p>Three more times he climbed, each time gaining one
story. The slightly sloping, tiled roofs ran some distance at that
level, and there was a breeze at that height, prickling the hair on
the back of his neck with its chill and almost making him think he
was being followed. <em>Stop that, fool! They&rsquo;re three streets away
by now, looking for somebody else with a fat purse, and bad luck to
them</em>.</p>

<p>His boots slipped on the tiles, and he decided it
might be a good idea to think about getting back down into the
street himself. Cautiously, he moved to the edge of the roof and
peered down. An empty street lay a good forty feet or more below
him, with three taverns and an inn spilling light and music onto
the cobblestones. But off to his right was a stone bridge running
from the top floor of his building to the one on the other
side.</p>

<p>The bridge looked awfully narrow, running through
darkness untouched by the tavern lights, arcing over a long fall to
hard cobblestones, but he tossed the quarterstaff down and made
himself follow before he could think about it too much. His boots
thumped onto the bridge, and he let himself roll the way he had as
a boy falling out of a tree. He fetched up against the waist-high
railing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bad habits pay off in the long run,&rdquo; he told himself
as he got to his feet and picked up the staff.</p>

<p>The window at the other end of the bridge was tightly
shuttered and lightless. He did not think whoever lived in there
would appreciate a stranger appearing in the middle of the night.
He could see lots of stonework, but if there was as much as a
fingerhold in reach of the bridge, the night hid it. <em>Well,
stranger or no stranger, inside I go</em>.</p>

<p>He turned from the railing and suddenly became aware
of a man sharing the bridge with him. A man with a dagger in his
hand.</p>

<p>Mat grabbed at the hand as the knife darted toward
his throat. He barely caught the fellow&rsquo;s wrist with his fingers,
and then the quarterstaff between them tangled itself in his legs,
tripping him to fall back against the railing, to fall half over it
pulling the other man on top of him. Balanced there on the small of
his back, teetering with his assailant&rsquo;s bared teeth in his face,
he was as aware of the long drop under his head as he was of the
blade catching faint moonlight as it edged toward his throat. His
finger grip on the man&rsquo;s wrist was slipping, and his other hand was
caught with the quarterstaff between their bodies. Only seconds had
passed since he first saw the man, and in seconds more, he was
going die with a knife in his throat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time to toss the dice,&rdquo; he said. He thought the
other man looked confused for an instant, but an instant was all he
had. With a heave of his legs, Mat flipped them both off into the
empty air.</p>

<p>For a stretched-out moment he seemed to have no
weight. Air whistled past his ears and ruffled his hair. He thought
he heard the other man scream, or start to. The impact knocked all
the air out of his lungs and made silver-black flecks dance across
his blurring vision.</p>

<p>When he could breathe again&mdash;and see&mdash;he
realized he was lying on top of the man who had attacked him, his
fall cushioned by the other&rsquo;s body. &ldquo;Luck,&rdquo; he whispered. Slowly he
climbed to his feet, cursing the bruise the quarterstaff had put
across his ribs.</p>

<p>He expected the other man to be dead&mdash;not many
could survive a thirty-foot fall to cobblestones with another&rsquo;s
weight on top of him&mdash;but what he had not expected was to see
the fellow&rsquo;s dagger driven to the hilt into his own heart. Such an
ordinary-looking man to have tried to kill him. Mat did not think
he would even have noticed him in a crowded room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had bad luck, fellow,&rdquo; he told the corpse
shakily.</p>

<p>Suddenly, everything that had happened rushed back in
on him. The footpads in the twisting street. The scramble over the
rooftops. This fellow. The fall. His eyes rose to the bridge
overhead, and a fit of trembling hit him. <em>I must have been
crazy. A little adventure is one thing, but Rogosh Eagle-eye
wouldn&rsquo;t ask for this</em>.</p>

<p>He realized he was standing over a dead man with a
dagger in his chest, just waiting for someone to come along and run
shouting for city guards with the Flame of Tar Valon on their
chests. The Amyrlin&rsquo;s paper might get him away from them, but maybe
not before she found out. He could still end up back in the White
Tower, without that paper, and possibly not even allowed outside
the Tower grounds.</p>

<p>He knew he should be on his way to the docks right
then, and on the first vessel sailing if it was a rotten tub full
of old fish, but his knees were shaking hard enough in reaction
that he could hardly walk. What he wanted was to sit down for just
a minute. Just a minute to steady his knees, and then he was headed
for the docks.</p>

<p>The taverns were closer, but he started toward the
inn. The common room of an inn was a friendly place, where a man
could rest a minute and not worry about who might be sneaking up
behind him. Enough light came out through the windows for him to
make out the sign. A woman with her hair in braids, holding what he
thought was an olive branch, and the words &ldquo;The Woman of
Tanchico.&rdquo;</p>
