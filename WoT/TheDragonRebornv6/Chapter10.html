<h4><em>Secrets</em></h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">I</span>gnoring
her companions for a moment, Egwene al&rsquo;Vere
stood in her stirrups hoping for a glimpse of Tar Valon in the
distance, but all she could see was something indistinct, gleaming
white in the morning sunlight. It had to be the city on the island,
though. The lone, broken-topped mountain called Dragonmount, rising
out of the rolling plain, had first appeared on the horizon late
the afternoon before, and that lay just this side of the River
Erinin from Tar Valon. It was a landmark, that mountain&mdash;one
jagged fang sticking up out of rolling flatlands&mdash;easily seen
for many miles, easy to avoid, as all did, even those who went to
Tar Valon.</p>

<p>Dragonmount was where Lews Therin Kinslayer had died,
so it was said; and other words had been spoken of the mountain,
prophecy and warning. Rich reasons to stay away from its black
slopes.</p>

<p>She had reason not to stay away, and more than one.
Only in Tar Valon could she find the training she needed, the
training she had to have. <em>I will never be collared again!</em>
She pushed the thought away, but it came back turned end about.
<em>I will never lose my freedom again!</em> In Tar Valon, Anaiya
would resume testing her dreams; the Aes Sedai would have to,
though she had found no real evidence that Egwene was a Dreamer, as
Anaiya suspected. Egwene&rsquo;s dreams had been troubling since leaving
Almoth Plain. Aside from dreams of the Seanchan&mdash;and those
still made her wake sweating&mdash;she dreamed more and more of
Rand. Rand running. Running toward something, but running away from
something, too.</p>

<p>She peered harder toward Tar Valon. Anaiya would be
there. <em>And Galad, too, perhaps</em>. She blushed in spite of
herself, and banished him from her mind entirely. <em>Think about
the weather. Think about anything else. Light, but it feels
warm</em>.</p>

<p>This early in the year, with winter only yesterday&rsquo;s
memory, white still capped Dragonmount, but here below, the snows
were melted. Early shoots poked through the matted brown of last
year&rsquo;s grasses, and where trees topped a low hill here and there,
the first red of new growth was showing. After a winter spent
traveling, sometimes trapped in village or camp for days by storms,
sometimes covering less ground between sunrise and sunset, with
snowdrifts belly-deep on the horses, than she could have walked by
noon in better weather, it was good to see signs of spring.</p>

<p>Sweeping her thick wool cloak back out of her way,
Egwene let herself drop down in the high-cantled saddle, and
smoothed her skirts in a gesture of impatience. Her dark eyes
filled with distaste. She had worn the dress, divided for riding by
her own skill with a needle, for far too long, but the only other
she had was even more grubby. And the same color, the dark gray of
the Leashed Ones. The choice all those weeks ago, on beginning
their ride to Tar Valon, had been dark gray or nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I swear I will never wear gray again, Bela,&rdquo; she
told her shaggy mount, patting the mare&rsquo;s neck. <em>Not that I&rsquo;ll
have much choice once we&rsquo;re back in the White Tower</em>, she
thought. In the Tower, all novices wore white.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you talking to yourself again?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked,
pulling her bay gelding closer. The two women were of a height as
well as dressed alike, but the difference in their horses put the
former Wisdom of Emond&rsquo;s Field a head taller. Nynaeve frowned now,
and tugged at the thick braid of dark hair hanging over her
shoulder, the way she did when worried or troubled, or sometimes
when she was preparing to be particularly stubborn even for her. A
Great Serpent ring on her finger marked her as one of the Accepted,
not yet Aes Sedai, but a long step closer than Egwene. &ldquo;Better you
should be keeping watch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene held her tongue on the retort that she had
been watching for Tar Valon. <em>Did she think I was standing in my
stirrups because I do not like my saddle?</em> Nynaeve seemed to
forget too often that she was not the Wisdom of Emond&rsquo;s Field any
longer, and Egwene was no longer a child. <em>But she wears the
ring and I do not</em>&mdash;<em>yet!</em>&mdash;<em>and for her,
that means nothing has changed!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you wonder how Moiraine is treating Lan?&rdquo; she
asked sweetly, and had a moment of pleasure at the sharp jerk
Nynaeve gave her braid. The pleasure faded quickly, though.
Wounding remarks did not come naturally to her, and she knew
Nynaeve&rsquo;s emotions concerning the Warder were like skeins of yarn
after a kitten had gotten into the knitting basket. But Lan was no
kitten, and Nynaeve would have to do something about the man before
his stubborn-stupid nobility made her mad enough to kill him.</p>

<p>They were six altogether, all plainly dressed enough
not to stand out in the villages and small towns they had
encountered, yet perhaps as odd a party as had crossed the Caralain
Grass anytime recently, four of them women, and one of the men in a
litter slung between two horses. The litter horses carried light
packs, as well, with supplies for the long stretches between
villages the way they had come.</p>

<p><em>Six people</em>, Egwene thought, <em>and how many
secrets?</em> They all shared more than one, secrets that would
have to be kept, perhaps, even in the White Tower. <em>Life was
simpler back home</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve, do you think Rand is all right? And
Perrin?&rdquo; she added hastily. She could not afford to pretend any
longer that one day she would marry Rand; pretending would be all
it was, now. She did not like that&mdash;she was not entirely
reconciled to it&mdash;but she knew it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your dreams? Have they been troubling you again?&rdquo;
Nynaeve sounded concerned, but Egwene was in no mood to accept
sympathy.</p>

<p>She made her voice sound as everyday as she could
manage. &ldquo;From the rumors we heard, I can&rsquo;t tell what might be going
on. They have everything I know about so twisted, so wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything has been wrong since Moiraine came into
our lives,&rdquo; Nynaeve said brusquely. &ldquo;Perrin and Rand&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She
hesitated, grimacing. Egwene thought Nynaeve believed everything
that Rand had become was Moiraine&rsquo;s doing. &ldquo;They will have to take
care of themselves for now. I&rsquo;m afraid we have something to worry
about ourselves. Something is not right. I can&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;feel it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know what?&rdquo; Egwene asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It feels almost like a storm.&rdquo; Nynaeve&rsquo;s dark eyes
studied the morning sky, clear and blue, with only a few scattered
white clouds, and she shook her head again. &ldquo;Like a storm coming.&rdquo;
Nynaeve had always been able to foretell the weather. Listening to
the wind, it was called, and the Wisdom of every village was
expected to do it, though many really could not. Yet since leaving
Emond&rsquo;s Field, Nynaeve&rsquo;s ability had grown, or changed. The storms
she felt sometimes had to do with men rather than wind, now.</p>

<p>Egwene bit her underlip, thinking. They could not
afford to be stopped or slowed, not after coming so far, not so
close to Tar Valon. For Mat&rsquo;s sake, and for reasons that her mind
might tell her were more important than the life of one village
youth, one childhood friend, but that her heart could not rate so
high. She looked at the others, wondering if any of them had
noticed something.</p>

<p>Verin Sedai, short and plump and all in shades of
brown, rode apparently lost in thought, the hood of her cloak
pulled forward till it all but hid her face, in the lead but
letting her horse amble at its own pace. She was of the Brown Ajah,
and the Brown sisters usually cared more for seeking out knowledge
than for anything in the world around them. Egwene was not so sure
of Verin&rsquo;s detachment, though. Verin had put herself hip-deep in
the affairs of the world by being with them.</p>

<p>Elayne, of an age with Egwene and also a novice, but
golden-haired and blue-eyed where Egwene was dark, rode back beside
the litter where Mat lay unconscious. In the same gray as Egwene
and Nynaeve, she was watching him with the worry they all felt. Mat
had not roused in three days, now. The lean, long-haired man riding
on the other side of the litter seemed to be trying to look
everywhere without anyone noticing, and the lines of his face had
deepened in concentration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurin,&rdquo; Egwene said, and Nynaeve nodded. They slowed
to let the litter catch up to them. Verin ambled on ahead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you sense something, Hurin?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked.
Elayne lifted her eyes, suddenly intent, from Mat&rsquo;s litter.</p>

<p>With the three of them looking at him, the lean man
shifted in his saddle and rubbed the side of his long nose.
&ldquo;Trouble,&rdquo; he said, curt and reluctant at the same time. &ldquo;I think
maybe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A thief-taker for the King of Shienar, he did not
wear a Shienaran warrior&rsquo;s topknot, yet the short sword and notched
sword-breaker at his belt were worn with use. Years of experience
seemed to have given him some talent at sniffing out wrongdoers,
especially those who had done violence.</p>

<p>Twice on the journey he had advised them to leave a
village after being there less than an hour. The first time, they
had all refused, saying they were too tired, but before the night
was done the innkeeper and two other men of the village had tried
to murder them in their beds. They were only simple thieves, not
Darkfriends, just greedy for the horses and whatever they had in
their saddlebags and bundles. But the rest of the village knew of
it, and apparently considered strangers fair gleanings. They had
been forced to flee a mob waving axe handles and pitchforks. The
second time, Verin ordered them to ride on as soon as Hurin
spoke.</p>

<p>But the thief-taker was always wary when talking to
any of his companions. Except Mat, back when Mat could talk; the
two of them had joked and played at dice, when the women were not
too close at hand. Egwene thought he might be uneasy at being
alone, for all practical purposes, with an Aes Sedai and three
women in training for sisterhood. Some men found facing a fight
easier than facing Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of trouble?&rdquo; Elayne said.</p>

<p>She spoke easily, but with such a clear note of
expecting to be answered, immediately and in detail, that Hurin
opened his mouth. &ldquo;I smell&mdash;&rdquo; He cut himself short and
blinked as if surprised, eyes darting from one woman to another.
&ldquo;Just a feeling,&rdquo; he said finally. &ldquo;A&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a hunch. I&rsquo;ve seen some
tracks, yesterday, and today. A lot of horses. Twenty or thirty
going this way, twenty or thirty that. It makes me wonder. That&rsquo;s
all. A feeling. But I say it&rsquo;s trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tracks? Egwene had not noticed them. Nynaeve said
sharply, &ldquo;I did not see anything worrisome in them.&rdquo; Nynaeve prided
herself on being as good a tracker as any man. &ldquo;They were days old.
What makes you think they are trouble?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just think they are,&rdquo; Hurin said slowly, as if he
wanted to say more. He dropped his eyes, rubbing at his nose and
inhaling deeply. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long time since we saw a village,&rdquo; he
muttered. &ldquo;Who knows what news from Falme has come before us? We
might not find so good a welcome as we expect. I&rsquo;m thinking these
men could be brigands, killers. We should be wary, I&rsquo;m thinking. If
Mat was on his feet, I&rsquo;d scout ahead, but maybe it&rsquo;s best I don&rsquo;t
leave you alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s eyebrows lifted. &ldquo;Do you believe we cannot
look after ourselves?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The One Power won&rsquo;t do you much good if somebody
kills you before you can use it,&rdquo; Hurin said, addressing the tall
pommel of his saddle. &ldquo;Begging your pardon, but I think I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll just ride up with Verin Sedai for a time.&rdquo; He dug in his heels
and galloped forward before any of them could speak again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that is a surprise,&rdquo; Elayne said as Hurin slowed
a little distance from the Brown sister. Verin did not seem to
notice him any more than she noticed anything else, and he appeared
content to leave it so. &ldquo;He has been staying as far from Verin as
he could ever since we left Toman Head. He always looks at her as
if he&rsquo;s afraid of what she might say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Respecting Aes Sedai doesn&rsquo;t mean he is not afraid
of them,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, then added, reluctantly, &ldquo;Of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he thinks there might be trouble, we ought to
send him out scouting.&rdquo; Egwene took a deep breath and gave the
other two women as level a look as she could manage. &ldquo;If there is
trouble, we can defend ourselves better than he could with a
hundred soldiers to help him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, flatly, &ldquo;and I
am not about to tell him. Or anyone else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can imagine what Verin would have to say about
it.&rdquo; Elayne sounded anxious. &ldquo;I wish I had some idea how much she
does know. Egwene, I don&rsquo;t know if my mother could help me if the
Amyrlin found out, much less help the pair of you. Or even whether
she would try.&rdquo; Elayne&rsquo;s mother was Queen of Andor. &ldquo;She was only
able to learn a little of the Power before she left the White
Tower, for all she has lived as if she had been raised to full
sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We cannot hope to rely on Morgase,&rdquo; Nynaeve said.
&ldquo;She is in Caemlyn, and we will be in Tar Valon. No, we may be in
enough trouble already for going off as we did, no matter what
we&rsquo;ve brought back. It will be best if we stay low, behave humbly,
and do nothing to attract more attention than we already have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another time, Egwene would have laughed at the idea
of Nynaeve pretending to be humble. Even Elayne managed a better
job of it. But at present she did not feel like laughing. &ldquo;And if
Hurin is right? If we are attacked? He cannot defend us against
twenty or thirty men, and we might be dead if we wait for Verin to
do something. You said you sense a storm, Nynaeve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do?&rdquo; Elayne said. Red-gold curls swung as she
shook her head. &ldquo;Verin will not like it if we&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She trailed
off. &ldquo;Whatever Verin likes or doesn&rsquo;t like, we may have to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do what must be done,&rdquo; Nynaeve said sharply,
&ldquo;if there is anything to be done, and you two will run, if need be.
The White Tower may be all abuzz with your potential, but don&rsquo;t
think they will not still you both if the Amyrlin Seat or the Hall
of the Tower decides it is necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne swallowed hard. &ldquo;If they would still us for
it,&rdquo; she said in a faint voice, &ldquo;they would still you, too. We
should all run together or act together. Hurin has been right
before. If we want to live to be in trouble in the Tower, we may
have to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to do what we must.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene shivered. Stilled. Cut off from <em>
saidar</em>, the female half of the True Source. Few Aes Sedai had
ever incurred that penalty, yet there were deeds for which the
Tower demanded stilling. Novices were required to learn the names
of every Aes Sedai who had ever been stilled, and their crimes.</p>

<p>She could always feel the Source there, now, just out
of sight, like the sun at noon over her shoulder. If she often
caught nothing when she tried to touch <em>saidar</em>, she still
wanted to touch it. The more she touched it, the more she wanted
to, all the time, no matter what Sheriam Sedai, the Mistress of
Novices, said about the dangers of growing too fond of the feel of
the One Power. To be cut off from it; still able to sense <em>
saidar</em>, but never to touch it again&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Neither of the others seemed to want to talk,
either.</p>

<p>To cover her shaking, she bent from her saddle to the
gently swaying litter. Mat&rsquo;s blankets had become disarrayed,
exposing a curved dagger in a golden sheath clutched in one hand, a
ruby the size of a pigeon&rsquo;s egg capping the hilt. Careful not to
touch the dagger, she eased the blankets back over his hand. He was
only a few years older than she, but gaunt cheeks and sallow skin
had aged him. His chest barely moved as he breathed hoarsely. A
lumpy leather sack lay at his feet. She shifted the blanket to
cover that, too. <em>We have to get Mat to the Tower</em>, she
thought. <em>And the sack</em>.</p>

<p>Nynaeve leaned down as well, and felt Mat&rsquo;s forehead.
&ldquo;His fever is worse.&rdquo; She sounded worried. &ldquo;If only I had some
worrynot root or feverbane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps if Verin tried Healing again,&rdquo; Elayne
said.</p>

<p>Nynaeve shook her head. She smoothed Mat&rsquo;s hair back
and sighed, then straightened before speaking. &ldquo;She says it is all
she can do to keep him alive, now, and I believe her. I tried
Healing last night myself, but nothing happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne gasped. &ldquo;Sheriam Sedai says we mustn&rsquo;t try to
Heal until we&rsquo;ve been guided step by step a hundred times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could have killed him,&rdquo; Egwene said sharply.</p>

<p>Nynaeve sniffed loudly. &ldquo;I was Healing before I ever
thought of going to Tar Valon, even if I didn&rsquo;t know I was. But it
seems I need my medicines to make it work for me. If I only had
some feverbane. I do not think he has much time left. Hours,
maybe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene thought she sounded almost as unhappy about
knowing, about how she knew, as she did about Mat. She wondered
again why Nynaeve had chosen to go to Tar Valon for training at
all. She had learned to channel unknowingly, even if she could not
always control the act, and had passed the crisis that killed three
out of four women who learned without Aes Sedai guidance. Nynaeve
said she wanted to learn more, but often she was as reluctant about
it as a child being dosed with sheepstongue root.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will have him in the White Tower soon,&rdquo; Egwene
said. &ldquo;They can Heal him there. The Amyrlin will take care of him.
She will take care of everything.&rdquo; She did not look at where Mat&rsquo;s
blanket covered the sack at his feet. The other two women were
studiously not looking at it, either. There were some secrets they
would all be relieved to shed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Riders,&rdquo; Nynaeve said suddenly, but Egwene had
already seen them. Two dozen men appearing over a low rise ahead,
white cloaks flapping as they galloped, angling toward them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Children of the Light,&rdquo; Elayne said, like a curse.
&ldquo;I think we have found your storm, and Hurin&rsquo;s trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verin had pulled up, a hand on Hurin&rsquo;s arm to stop
him drawing his sword. Egwene touched the lead litter horse to stop
it just behind the plump Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me do all the talking, children,&rdquo; the Aes Sedai
said placidly, pushing her cowl back to reveal gray in her hair.
Egwene was not sure how old Verin was; she thought old enough to be
a grandmother, but the gray streaks were the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s only signs
of age. &ldquo;And whatever you do, do not allow them to make you
angry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verin&rsquo;s face was as calm as her voice, but Egwene
thought she saw the Aes Sedai measuring the distance to Tar Valon.
The tops of the towers were visible now, and a high bridge arching
over the river to the island, tall enough for the trading ships
that plied the river to sail beneath.</p>

<p><em>Close enough to see</em>, Egwene thought, <em>but
too far to do any good</em>.</p>

<p>For a moment she was sure the oncoming Whitecloaks
meant to charge them, but their leader raised a hand and they
abruptly drew rein a scant forty paces off, scattering dust and
dirt ahead of them.</p>

<p>Nynaeve muttered angrily under her breath, and Elayne
sat straight and full of pride, appearing likely to berate the
Whitecloaks for ill manners. Hurin still had a grip on his sword
hilt; he looked ready to put himself between the women and the
Whitecloaks no matter what Verin said. Verin mildly waved a hand in
front of her face to dispel the dust. The white-cloaked riders
spread out in an arc, blocking the way firmly.</p>

<p>Their breastplates and conical helmets shone from
polishing, and even the mail on their arms gleamed brightly. Each
man had the flaring, golden sun on his breast. Some fitted arrows
to bows, which they did not raise, but held ready. Their leader was
a young man, yet he wore two golden knots of rank beneath the
sunburst on his cloak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two Tar Valon witches, unless I miss my guess, yes?&rdquo;
he said with a tight smile that pinched his narrow face. Arrogance
brightened his eyes, as if he knew some truth others were too
stupid to see. &ldquo;And two nits, and a pair of lapdogs, one sick and
one old.&rdquo; Hurin bristled, but Verin&rsquo;s hand restrained him. &ldquo;Where
do you come from?&rdquo; the Whitecloak demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We come from the west,&rdquo; Verin said placidly. &ldquo;Move
out of our way, and let us continue. The Children of the Light have
no authority here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Children have authority wherever the Light is,
witch, and where the Light is not, we bring it. Answer my
questions! Or must I take you to our camp and let the Questioners
ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat could not afford any more delay in reaching help
in the White Tower. And more importantly&mdash;Egwene winced to
think of it that way&mdash;more importantly, they could not let
the contents of that sack fall into Whitecloak hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have answered you,&rdquo; Verin said, still calm, &ldquo;and
more politely than you deserve. Do you really believe you can stop
us?&rdquo; Some of the Whitecloaks raised their bows as if she had
uttered a threat, but she went on, her voice never rising. &ldquo;In some
lands you may hold sway by your threats, but not here, in sight of
Tar Valon. Can you truly believe that in this place, you will be
allowed to carry off Aes Sedai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The officer shifted uneasily in his saddle, as though
suddenly doubting whether he could back up his words. Then he
glanced back at his men&mdash;either to remind himself of their
support or because he had remembered they were watching&mdash;and
with that he took himself in hand. &ldquo;I have no fear of your
Darkfriend ways, witch. Answer me, or answer the Questioners.&rdquo; He
did not sound as forceful as he had.</p>

<p>Verin opened her mouth as if for idle conversation,
but before she could speak, Elayne jumped in, voice ringing with
command. &ldquo;I am Elayne, Daughter-Heir of Andor. If you do not move
aside at once, you will have Queen Morgase to answer to,
Whitecloak!&rdquo; Verin hissed with vexation.</p>

<p>The Whitecloak looked taken aback for an instant, but
then he laughed. &ldquo;You think it so, yes? Perhaps you will discover
Morgase no longer has so much love for witches, girl. If I take you
from them and return you to her side, she will thank me for it.
Lord Captain Eamon Valda would like very much to speak to you,
Daughter-Heir of Andor.&rdquo; He raised a hand, whether to gesture or
signal his men, Egwene could not say. Some of the Whitecloaks
gathered their reins.</p>

<p><em>There&rsquo;s no more time to wait</em>, Egwene
thought. <em>I will not be chained again!</em> She opened herself
to the One Power. It was a simple exercise, and after long
practice, it went much more swiftly than the first time she had
tried. In a heartbeat her mind emptied of everything, everything
but a single rosebud, floating in emptiness. She was the rosebud,
opening to the light, opening to <em>saidar</em>, the female half
of the True Source. The Power flooded her, threatening to sweep her
away. It was like being filled with light, with the Light, like
being one with the Light, a glorious ecstasy. She fought to keep
from being overwhelmed, and focused on the ground in front of the
Whitecloak officer&rsquo;s horse. A small patch of ground; she did not
want to kill anyone. <em>You will not take me!</em></p>

<p>The man&rsquo;s hand was still going up. With a roar the
ground in front of him erupted in a narrow fountain of dirt and
rocks higher than his head. Screaming, his horse reared, and he
rolled out of his saddle like a sack.</p>

<p>Before he hit the ground, Egwene shifted her focus
closer to the other Whitecloaks, and the ground threw up another
small explosion. Bela danced sideways, but she controlled the mare
with reins and knees without even thinking of it. Wrapped inside
emptiness, she was still surprised at a third eruption, not of her
making, and a fourth. Distantly, she was aware of Nynaeve and
Elayne, both enveloped in the glow that said they, too, had
embraced <em>saidar</em>, had been embraced by it. That aura would
not be visible to any but another woman who could channel, but the
results were visible to all. Explosions harried the Whitecloaks on
every side, showering them with dirt, shaking them with noise,
sending their horses plunging wildly.</p>

<p>Hurin stared around him, mouth open and obviously as
frightened as the Whitecloaks, as he tried to keep the litter
horses and his own mount from bolting. Verin was wide-eyed with
astonishment and anger. Her mouth worked furiously, but whatever
she might be saying was lost in the thunder.</p>

<p>And then the Whitecloaks were running away, some
dropping their bows in panic, galloping as if the Dark One himself
were at their backs. All but the young officer, who was picking
himself up off the ground. Shoulders hunched, he stared at Verin,
the whites of his eyes showing all the way &rsquo;round. Dust stained his
fine white cloak, and his face, but he did not seem to notice.
&ldquo;Kill me, then, witch,&rdquo; he said shakily. &ldquo;Go ahead. Kill me, as you
killed my father!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai ignored him. Her attention was all on
her companions. As if they, too, had forgotten their officer, the
fleeing Whitecloaks vanished over the same rise where they had
first appeared, all in a body and none looking back. The officer&rsquo;s
horse ran with them.</p>

<p>Under Verin&rsquo;s furious gaze, Egwene let go of <em>
saidar</em>, slowly, unwillingly. It was always hard, letting go.
Even more slowly, the glow around Nynaeve vanished. Nynaeve was
frowning hard at the pinch-faced Whitecloak before them, as if he
might still be capable of some sort of trickery. Elayne looked
shocked by what she had done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you have done,&rdquo; Verin began, then stopped to
take a deep breath. Her stare took in all three of the younger
women. &ldquo;What you have done is an abomination. An abomination! An
Aes Sedai does not use the Power as a weapon except against
Shadowspawn, or in the last extreme to defend her life. The Three
Oaths&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were ready to kill us,&rdquo; Nynaeve broke in
heatedly. &ldquo;Kill us, or carry us off to be tortured. He was giving
the order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;it was not really using the Power as a
weapon, Verin Sedai.&rdquo; Elayne held her chin high, but her voice
shook. &ldquo;We did not hurt anyone, or even try to hurt anyone. Surely&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not split hairs with me!&rdquo; Verin snapped. &ldquo;When
you become full Aes Sedai&mdash;if you ever become full Aes Sedai!&mdash;you will be bound to obey the Three Oaths, but even novices
are expected to do their best to live as if already bound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about him?&rdquo; Nynaeve gestured to the Whitecloak
officer, still standing there and looking stunned. Her face was as
tight as a drum; she seemed almost as angry as the Aes Sedai. &ldquo;He
was about to take us prisoner. Mat will die if he doesn&rsquo;t reach the
Tower soon, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene knew what Nynaeve was struggling not to say
aloud. <em>And we can&rsquo;t let that sack fall into any hands but the
Amyrlin&rsquo;s</em>.</p>

<p>Verin regarded the Whitecloak wearily. &ldquo;He was only
trying to bully us, child. He knew very well he could not make us
go where we did not want, not without more trouble than he was
willing to accept. Not here, not in sight of Tar Valon. I could
have talked us past him, with a little time and a little patience.
Oh, he might well have tried to kill us if he could have done it
from hiding, but no Whitecloak with the brains of a goat will try
harming an Aes Sedai who knows he is there. See what you have done!
What stories will those men tell, and what harm will it do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The officer&rsquo;s face had reddened when she mentioned
hiding. &ldquo;It is no cowardice not to charge the powers that Broke the
World,&rdquo; he burst out. &ldquo;You witches want to Break the World again,
in the service of the Dark One!&rdquo; Verin shook her head in tired
disbelief.</p>

<p>Egwene wished she could mend some of the damage she
had done. &ldquo;I am very sorry for what I did,&rdquo; she told the officer.
She was glad she was not bound to speak no word that was not true,
as full Aes Sedai were, because what she had said was only half
true at best. &ldquo;I should not have, and I apologize. I am sure Verin
Sedai will Heal your bruises.&rdquo; He stepped back as if she had
offered to have him skinned alive, and Verin sniffed loudly. &ldquo;We
have come a long way,&rdquo; Egwene went on, &ldquo;all the way from Toman
Head, and if I weren&rsquo;t so tired, I would never have&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, girl!&rdquo; Verin shouted at the same time the
Whitecloak snarled, &ldquo;Toman Head? Falme! You were at Falme!&rdquo; He
stumbled back another step and half drew his sword. From the look
on his face, Egwene did not know whether he meant to attack, or to
defend himself. Hurin moved his horse closer to the Whitecloak, a
hand on his sword&shy;breaker, but the narrow-faced man went on in
a rant, spittle flying with his fury. &ldquo;My father died at Falme!
Byar told me! You witches killed him for your false Dragon! I&rsquo;ll
see you dead for it! I will see you burn!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impetuous children,&rdquo; Verin sighed. &ldquo;Almost as bad as
boys for letting your mouths run away with you. Go with the Light,
my son,&rdquo; she told the Whitecloak.</p>

<p>Without another word, she guided them around the man,
but his shouts followed after. &ldquo;My name is Dain Bornhald! Remember
it, Darkfriends! I will make you fear my name! Remember my
name!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Bornhald&rsquo;s shouts faded behind them, they rode in
silence for a time. Finally, Egwene said to no one in particular,
&ldquo;I was only trying to make things better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better!&rdquo; Verin muttered. &ldquo;You must learn there is a
time to speak all of the truth, and a time to govern your tongue.
The least of the lessons you must learn, but important, if you mean
to live long enough to wear the shawl of a full sister. Did it
never occur to you that word of Falme might have come ahead of
us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should it have occurred to her?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked.
&ldquo;No one we&rsquo;ve met before this had heard more than rumors, if that,
and we have outrun even rumor in the last month.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And all word has to come along the same roads we
used?&rdquo; Verin replied. &ldquo;We have moved slowly. Rumor takes wing along
a hundred paths. Always plan for the worst, child; that way, all
your surprises will be pleasant ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did he mean about my mother?&rdquo; Elayne said
suddenly. &ldquo;He must have been lying. She would never turn against
Tar Valon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Queens of Andor have always been friends to Tar
Valon, but all things change.&rdquo; Verin&rsquo;s face was calm again, yet
there was a tightness in her voice. She turned in her saddle to
look over them, the three young women, Hurin, Mat in the litter.
&ldquo;The world is strange, and all things change.&rdquo; They capped the
ridge; a village was in sight ahead of them now, yellow tile roofs
clustered around the great bridge that led to Tar Valon. &ldquo;Now you
must truly be on your guard,&rdquo; Verin told them. &ldquo;Now the real danger
begins.&rdquo;</p>
