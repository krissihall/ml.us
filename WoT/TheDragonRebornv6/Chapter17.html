<h4><em>The Red Sister</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">E</span>laida
was a handsome woman rather than beautiful,
and the sternness on her face added maturity to her ageless Aes
Sedai features. She did not look old, yet Egwene could never
imagine Elaida as having been young. Except for the most formal
occasions, few Aes Sedai wore the vine-embroidered shawl with the
white teardrop Flame of Tar Valon large on the wearer&rsquo;s back, but
Elaida wore hers, the long red fringe announcing her Ajah. Red
slashed her dress of cream-colored silk, too, and red slippers
peeked under the edge of her skirts as she moved into the room. Her
dark eyes watched them as a bird&rsquo;s eyes watched worms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So all of you are together. Somehow, that does not
surprise me.&rdquo; Her voice made no more pretense than her bearing did;
she was a woman of power, and ready to wield it if she decided it
was necessary, a woman who knew more than those she spoke to. It
was much the same for a queen as for a novice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, Elaida Sedai,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, dropping
another curtsy, &ldquo;but I was about to go out. I have much to catch up
in my studies. If you will forgive&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your studies can wait,&rdquo; Elaida said. &ldquo;They have
waited long enough already, after all.&rdquo; She plucked the cloth bag
out of Nynaeve&rsquo;s hands and undid the strings, but after one glance
inside, she tossed it on the floor. &ldquo;Herbs. You are not a village
Wisdom any longer, child. Trying to hold on to the past will only
hold you back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elaida Sedai,&rdquo; Elayne said, &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be silent, novice.&rdquo; Elaida&rsquo;s voice was cold and
soft, as silk wrapped around steel is soft. &ldquo;You may have broken a
bond between Tar Valon and Caemlyn that has lasted three thousand
years. You will speak when spoken to.&rdquo; Elayne&rsquo;s eyes examined the
floor in front of her toes. Spots of color burned in her cheeks.
Guilt, or anger? Egwene was not sure.</p>

<p>Ignoring them all, Elaida sat down in one of the
chairs, carefully arranging her skirts. She made no gesture for the
rest of them to sit. Nynaeve&rsquo;s face tightened, and she began giving
sharp little tugs to her braid. Egwene hoped she would keep her
temper well enough not to take the other chair without
permission.</p>

<p>When Elaida had settled herself to her own
satisfaction, she studied them for a time in silence, her face
unreadable. At last she said, &ldquo;Did you know that we have the Black
Ajah among us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene exchanged startled glances with Nynaeve and
Elayne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were told,&rdquo; Nynaeve said cautiously. &ldquo;Elaida
Sedai,&rdquo; she added after a pause.</p>

<p>Elaida arched an eyebrow. &ldquo;Yes. I thought that you
might know of it.&rdquo; Egwene gave a start at her tone, implying so
much more than it said, and Nynaeve opened her mouth angrily, but
the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s flat stare stilled tongues. &ldquo;The two of you,&rdquo;
Elaida went on in a casual tone, &ldquo;vanish, taking with you the
Daughter-Heir of Andor&mdash;the girl who <em>may</em> become
Queen of Andor one day, if I do not strip off her hide and sell it
to a glove maker&mdash;vanish without permission, without a word,
without a trace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was not carried off,&rdquo; Elayne said to the floor. &ldquo;I
went of my own will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you obey me, child?&rdquo; A glow surrounded Elaida.
The Aes Sedai&rsquo;s glare was fixed on Elayne. &ldquo;Must I teach you, here
and now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne raised her head, and there was no mistaking
what was in her face. Anger. For a long moment she met Elaida&rsquo;s
stare.</p>

<p>Egwene&rsquo;s fingernails dug into her palms. It was
maddening. She, or Elayne, or Nynaeve, could destroy Elaida where
she sat. If they caught Elaida by surprise, at least; she was fully
trained, after all. <em>And if we do anything but take whatever she
wants to feed us, we throw away everything. Don&rsquo;t throw it away
now, Elayne</em>.</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s head dropped. &ldquo;Forgive me, Elaida Sedai,&rdquo;
she mumbled. &ldquo;I&mdash;forgot myself &rdquo;</p>

<p>The glow winked out of existence, and Elaida sniffed
audibly. &ldquo;You have learned bad habits, wherever these two took you.
You cannot afford bad habits, child. You will be the first Queen of
Andor ever to be Aes Sedai. The first queen anywhere to be Aes
Sedai in over a thousand years. You will be one of the strongest of
us since the Breaking of the World, perhaps strong enough to be the
first ruler since the Breaking to openly tell the world she is Aes
Sedai. Do not risk all of that, child, because you can still lose
it all. I have invested too much time to see that. Do you
understand me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so, Elaida Sedai,&rdquo; Elayne said. She sounded
as if she did not understand at all. No more did Egwene.</p>

<p>Elaida abandoned the subject. &ldquo;You may be in grave
danger. All three of you. You disappear and return, and in the
interval, Liandrin and her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;companions leave us. There will
inevitably be comparisons. We are sure Liandrin and those who went
with her are Darkfriends. Black Ajah. I would not see the same
charge leveled at Elayne, and to protect her, it seems I must
protect all of you. Tell me why you ran away, and what you have
been doing these months, and I will do what I can for you.&rdquo; Her
eyes fastened on Egwene like grappling hooks.</p>

<p>Egwene floundered for an answer that the Aes Sedai
would accept. It was said that Elaida could hear a lie, sometimes.
&ldquo;It&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;it was Mat. He is very sick.&rdquo; She tried to choose her
words carefully, to say nothing that was not true, yet give an
impression far from truth. <em>Aes Sedai do it all the time</em>.
&ldquo;We went to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;We brought him back to be Healed. If we hadn&rsquo;t,
he would die. The Amyrlin is going to Heal him.&rdquo; <em>I hope</em>.
She made herself continue to meet the Red Aes Sedai&rsquo;s gaze, willed
herself not to shift her feet guiltily. From Elaida&rsquo;s face, there
was no way to tell whether she believed a word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is enough, Egwene,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. Elaida&rsquo;s
penetrating look shifted to her, but she gave no sign of being
affected by it. She met the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s eyes without blinking.
&ldquo;Forgive me for interrupting, Elaida Sedai,&rdquo; she said smoothly,
&ldquo;but the Amyrlin Seat said our transgressions were to be put behind
us and forgotten. As part of making a new beginning, we are not
even to speak of them. The Amyrlin said it should be as if they
never happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She said that, did she?&rdquo; Still nothing in Elaida&rsquo;s
voice or on her face told whether she believed or not.
&ldquo;Interesting. You can hardly forget entirely when your punishment
has been announced to the entire Tower. Unprecedented, that.
Unheard of, for less than stilling. I can see why you are eager to
put it all behind you. I understand you are to be raised to the
Accepted, Elayne. And Egwene. That is hardly punishment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne glanced at the Aes Sedai as though for
permission to speak. &ldquo;The Mother said we were ready,&rdquo; she said. A
touch of defiance entered her voice. &ldquo;I have learned, Elaida Sedai,
and grown. She would not have named me to be raised if I had
not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Learned,&rdquo; Elaida said musingly. &ldquo;And grown. Perhaps
you have.&rdquo; There was no hint in her tone whether she thought this
was good. Her gaze shifted back to Egwene and Nynaeve, searching.
&ldquo;You returned with this Mat, a youth from your village. There was
another young man from your village. Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene felt as if an icy hand had suddenly gripped
her stomach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope he is well,&rdquo; Nynaeve said levelly, but her
hand was a fist gripping her braid. &ldquo;We have not seen him in some
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An interesting young man.&rdquo; Elaida studied them as
she spoke. &ldquo;I met him only once, but I found him&mdash;most
interesting. I believe he must be <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>. Yes. The
answers to many questions may rest in him. This Emond&rsquo;s Field of
yours must be an unusual place to produce the two of you. And Rand
al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is just a village,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. &ldquo;Just a village
like any other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Of course.&rdquo; Elaida smiled, a cold quirk of her
lips that twisted Egwene&rsquo;s stomach. &ldquo;Tell me about him. The Amyrlin
has not commanded you to be silent about him also, has she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve gave her braid a tug. Elayne studied the
carpet as if something important were hidden in it, and Egwene
wracked her brain for an answer. <em>She can hear lies, they say.
Light, if she can really hear a lie</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The moment stretched
on, until finally Nynaeve opened her mouth.</p>

<p>At that instant the door opened again. Sheriam
regarded the room with a measure of surprise. &ldquo;It is well I find
you here, Elayne. I want all three of you. I had not expected you,
Elaida.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elaida stood, arranging her shawl. &ldquo;We are all
curious about these girls. Why they ran away. What adventures they
had while gone. They say the Mother has commanded them not to speak
of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As well not to,&rdquo; Sheriam said. &ldquo;They are to be
punished, and that should be an end to it. I have always felt that
when punishment is done, the fault that caused it should be
erased.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a long moment the two Aes Sedai stood looking at
each other, no expression on either smooth face. Then Elaida said,
&ldquo;Of course. Perhaps I will speak to them another time. About other
matters.&rdquo; The look she gave to the three women in white seemed to
Egwene to carry a warning, and then she was slipping past
Sheriam.</p>

<p>Holding the door open, the Mistress of Novices
watched the other Aes Sedai go down the gallery. Her face was still
unreadable.</p>

<p>Egwene let out a long breath, and heard echoes from
Nynaeve and Elayne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She threatened me,&rdquo; Elayne said incredulously, and
half to herself. &ldquo;She threatened me with stilling, if I don&rsquo;t stop
being&mdash;<em>willful</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mistook her,&rdquo; Sheriam said. &ldquo;If being willful
were a stilling offense, the list of the stilled would have more
names on it than you could learn. Few meek women ever achieve the
ring and the shawl. That is not to say, of course, that you must
not learn to act meekly when it is required.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sheriam Sedai,&rdquo; they all three said almost as
one, and Sheriam smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see? You can give the appearance of meekness, at
least. And you will have plenty of opportunity to practice before
you earn your way back into the Amyrlin&rsquo;s good graces. And mine.
Mine will be harder to achieve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sheriam Sedai,&rdquo; Egwene said, but this time only
Elayne spoke with her.</p>

<p>Nynaeve said, &ldquo;What of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the body, Sheriam Sedai?
The&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the Soulless? Have you discovered who killed him? Or why
he entered the Tower?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sheriam&rsquo;s mouth tightened. &ldquo;You take one step
forward, Nynaeve, and then a step back. Since from Elayne&rsquo;s lack of
surprise, you have obviously told her of it&mdash;<em>after I told
you not to speak of the matter!</em>&mdash;then there are exactly
seven people in the Tower who know a man was killed today in the
novices&rsquo; quarters, and two of them are men who know no more than
that. Except that they are to keep their mouths shut. If an order
from the Mistress of Novices carries no weight with you&mdash;and
if that is so, I will correct you&mdash;perhaps you will obey one
from the Amyrlin Seat. You are to speak of this to no one except
the Mother or me. The Amyrlin will not have more rumors piled on
those we must already contend with. Do I make myself clear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The firmness of her voice produced a chorus of &ldquo;Yes,
Sheriam Sedai&rdquo;&mdash;but Nynaeve refused to stop at that. &ldquo;Seven,
you said, Sheriam Sedai. Plus whoever killed him. And maybe they
had help getting into the Tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is no concern of yours.&rdquo; Sheriam&rsquo;s level gaze
included them all. &ldquo;I will ask whatever questions must be asked
about this man. You will forget you know anything at all about a
dead man. If I discover you are doing anything else&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Well,
there are worse things than scrubbing pots to occupy your
attention. And I will not accept any excuses. Do I hear any more
questions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Sheriam Sedai.&rdquo; This time, Nynaeve joined in, to
Egwene&rsquo;s relief. Not that she felt very much relief. Sheriam&rsquo;s
watchful eye would make it doubly hard to carry out a search for
the Black Ajah. For a moment she felt like laughing hysterically.
<em>If the Black Ajah doesn&rsquo;t catch us, Sheriam will</em>. The urge
to laugh vanished. <em>If Sheriam isn&rsquo;t Black Ajah herself</em>.
She wished she could make that thought go away.</p>

<p>Sheriam nodded. &ldquo;Very well, then. You will come with
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To where?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked, and added, &ldquo;Sheriam
Sedai,&rdquo; only an instant before the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you forgotten,&rdquo; Sheriam said in a tight voice,
&ldquo;that in the Tower, Healing is always done in the presence of those
who bring their sick to us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene thought that the Mistress of Novices&rsquo;s stock
of patience with them was about used up, but before she could stop
herself, she burst out, &ldquo;Then she <em>is</em> going to Heal him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Amyrlin Seat herself, among others, will see to
him.&rdquo; Sheriam&rsquo;s face held no more expression than her voice. &ldquo;Did
you have reason to doubt it?&rdquo; Egwene could only shake her head.
&ldquo;Then you waste your friend&rsquo;s life standing here. The Amyrlin Seat
is not to be kept waiting.&rdquo; Yet despite her words, Egwene had the
feeling the Aes Sedai was in no hurry at all.</p>
