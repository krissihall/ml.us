<h4><em>Maidens of the Spear</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">E</span>gwene
embraced <em>saidar</em> before the scream was
well out of her mouth, and she saw the glow around Elayne, too. For
an instant she wondered if Ellisor had heard their screams and
would send help; the <em>Blue Crane</em> could not be more than a
mile upriver. Then she was dismissing the need for help, already
weaving flows of Air and Fire into lightning. She could almost
still hear their yelling.</p>

<p>Nynaeve was simply standing there with her arms
crossed beneath her breasts and a firm expression on her face, but
Egwene was not sure whether that was because she was not angry
enough to touch the True Source, or because she had already seen
what Egwene was just now seeing. The person facing them was a woman
no older than Egwene herself, if somewhat taller.</p>

<p>She did not let go of <em>saidar</em>. Men were
sometimes silly enough to think a woman was harmless merely because
she was a woman; Egwene had no such illusions. In a corner of her
mind she noted that Elayne was no longer surrounded by the glow.
The Daughter-Heir must still harbor foolish notions. <em>She was
never a Seanchan prisoner</em>.</p>

<p>Egwene did not think many men would be stupid enough
to think the woman in front of them was not dangerous, even though
her hands were empty and she wore no visible weapon. Blue-green
eyes and reddish hair cut short except for a narrow tail that hung
to her shoulders; soft, laced knee-boots and close-fitting coat and
breeches all in the shades of earth and rock. Such coloring and
clothing had been described to her once; this woman was Aiel.</p>

<p>Looking at her, Egwene felt a sudden odd affinity for
the woman. She could not understand it. <em>She looks like Rand&rsquo;s
cousin, that&rsquo;s why</em>. Yet even that feeling&mdash;almost of
kinship&mdash;could not stifle her curiosity. <em>What under the
Light are Aiel doing here? They never leave the Waste; not since
the Aiel War</em>. She had heard all of her life how deadly Aiel
were&mdash;these Maidens of the Spear no less than the members of
the male warrior societies&mdash;but she felt no particular fear
and, indeed, some irritation at having been afraid. With <em>
saidar</em> feeding the One Power into her, she had no need to fear
anyone. <em>Except maybe a fully trained sister</em>, she admitted. <em>But
certainly not one woman, even if she</em> is <em>Aiel</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Aviendha,&rdquo; the Aiel woman said, &ldquo;of the
Nine Valleys sept of the Taardad Aiel.&rdquo; Her face was as flat and
expressionless as her voice. &ldquo;I am <em>Far Dareis Mai</em>, a
Maiden of the Spear.&rdquo; She paused a moment, studying them. &ldquo;You have
not the look in your faces, but we saw the rings. In your lands,
you have women much like our Wise Ones, the women called Aes Sedai.
Are you women of the White Tower, or not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Egwene did feel unease. <em>We?</em> She
looked around them carefully, but saw no one behind any bush within
twenty paces.</p>

<p>If there were others, they had to be in the next
thicket, more than two hundred paces ahead, or in the last one,
twice that distance behind. Too far to threaten. <em>Unless they
have bows</em>. But they would have to be good with them. Back
home, in the competitions at Bel Tine and Sunday, only the best
bowmen shot at any distance much beyond two hundred paces.</p>

<p>But she still felt better knowing she could hurl a
lightning bolt at anyone who tried such a shot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are women of the White Tower,&rdquo; Nynaeve said
calmly. She was very obvious in not looking around for other Aiel.
Even Elayne was peering about. &ldquo;Whether you would consider any of
us wise is another matter,&rdquo; Nynaeve went on. &ldquo;What do you want of
us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha smiled. She was really quite lovely, Egwene
realized; the grim expression had masked it. &ldquo;You talk as the Wise
Ones do. To the point, and small suffering of fools.&rdquo; Her smile
faded, but her voice remained calm. &ldquo;One of us lies gravely hurt,
perhaps dying. The Wise Ones often heal those who would surely die
without them, and I have heard Aes Sedan can do more. Will you aid
her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene almost shook her head in confusion. <em>A
friend of hers is dying? She sounds as if she is asking if we&rsquo;ll
lend her a cup of barley flour!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;I will help her if I can,&rdquo; Nynaeve said slowly. &ldquo;I
cannot make promises, Aviendha. She may die despite anything I can
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Death comes for us all,&rdquo; the Aiel said. &ldquo;We can only
choose how to face it when it comes. I will take you to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two women in Aiel garb stood up no more than ten
paces away, one out of a little fold in the ground that Egwene
would not have supposed could hide a dog, and the other in grass
that reached only halfway to her knees. They lowered their black
veils as they stood&mdash;that gave her another jolt; she was sure
Elayne had told her the Aiel only hid their faces when they might
have to do killing&mdash;and settled the cloth that had wrapped
their heads about their shoulders. One had the same reddish hair as
Aviendha, with gray eyes, the other dark blue eyes and hair like
fire. Neither was any older than Egwene or Elayne, and both looked
ready to use the short spears in their hands.</p>

<p>The woman with fiery hair handed Aviendha weapons; a
long, heavy-bladed knife to belt at her waist, and a bristling
quiver for the other side; a dark, curved bow that had the dull
shine of horn, in a case to fasten on her back; and four short
spears with long points to grip in her left hand along with a
small, round hide buckler. Aviendha wore them as naturally as a
woman in Emond&rsquo;s Field would wear a scarf, just as her companions
did. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said, and started for the thicket they had already
passed.</p>

<p>Egwene finally released <em>saidar</em>. She
suspected all three of the Aiel could stab her with those spears
before she could do anything about it, if that was what they
wanted, but though they were wary, she did not think they would.
<em>And what if Nynaeve can&rsquo;t Heal their friend? I wish she would
ask before she makes these decisions that involve all of
us!</em></p>

<p>As they headed for the trees, the Aiel scanned the
land around them as if they expected the empty landscape to hold
enemies as adept at hiding as themselves. Aviendha strode ahead,
and Nynaeve kept up with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Elayne of House Trakand,&rdquo; Egwene&rsquo;s friend said
as if making conversation, &ldquo;Daughter-Heir to Morgase, Queen of
Andor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene stumbled. <em>Light, is she mad? I know Andor
fought them in the Aiel War. It might be twenty years, but they say
Aiel have long memories</em>.</p>

<p>But the flame-haired Aiel closest to her only said,
&ldquo;I am Bain, of the Black Rock sept of the Shaarad Aiel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Chiad,&rdquo; the shorter, blonder woman on her other
side said, &ldquo;of the Stones River sept of the Goshien Aiel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bain and Chiad glanced at Egwene; their expressions
did not change, but she had the feeling they thought she was
showing bad manners.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Egwene al&rsquo;Vere,&rdquo; she told them. They seemed to
expect more, so she added, &ldquo;Daughter of Marin al&rsquo;Vere, of Emond&rsquo;s
Field, in the Two Rivers.&rdquo; That seemed to satisfy them, in a way,
but she would have bet they understood it no more than she did all
these septs and clans. <em>It must mean families, in some
way</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are first-sisters?&rdquo; Bain seemed to be taking in
all three of them.</p>

<p>Egwene thought they must mean sisters as it was used
for Aes Sedai, and said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; just as Elayne said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chiad and Bain exchanged a very quick look that
suggested they were talking to women who might not be completely
whole in their minds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First-sister,&rdquo; Elayne told Egwene as if she were
lecturing, &ldquo;means women who have the same mother. Second-sister
means their mothers are sisters.&rdquo; She turned her words to the Aiel.
&ldquo;We neither of us know a great deal of your people. I ask you to
excuse our ignorance. I sometimes think of Egwene as a
first-sister, but we are not blood kin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why do you not speak the words before your Wise
Ones?&rdquo; Chiad asked. &ldquo;Bain and I became first-sisters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene blinked. &ldquo;How can you <em>become</em>
first-sisters? Either you have the same mother, or you do not. I do
not mean to offend. Most of what I know about the Maidens of the
Spear comes from the little Elayne has told me. I know you fight in
battle and don&rsquo;t care for men, but no more than that.&rdquo; Elayne
nodded; the way she had described the Maidens to Egwene had sounded
much like a cross between female Warders and the Red Ajah.</p>

<p>That look flashed back across the Aiel&rsquo;s faces, as if
they were not certain how much sense Egwene and Elayne had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do not care for men?&rdquo; Chiad murmured as if
puzzled.</p>

<p>Bain knotted her brow in thought. &ldquo;What you say comes
near truth, yet misses it completely. When we wed the spear, we
pledge to be bound to no man or child. Some do give up the spear,
for a man or a child&rdquo;&mdash;her expression said she herself did
not understand this&mdash;&ldquo;but once given up, the spear cannot be
taken back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or if she is chosen to go to Rhuidean,&rdquo; Chiad put
in. &ldquo;A Wise One cannot be wedded to the spear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bain looked at her as if she had announced the sky
was blue, or that rain fell from clouds. The glance she gave Egwene
and Elayne said perhaps they did not know these things. &ldquo;Yes, that
is true. Though some try to struggle against it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they do.&rdquo; Chiad sounded as though she and Bain
were sharing something between them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I have gone far from the trail of my
explanation,&rdquo; Bain went on. &ldquo;The Maidens do not dance the spears
with one another even when our clans do, but the Shaarad Aiel and
the Goshien Aiel have held blood feud between them over four
hundred years, so Chiad and I felt our wedding pledge was not
enough. We went to speak the words before the Wise Ones of our
clans&mdash;she risking her life in my hold, and I in hers&mdash;to bond us as first-sisters. As is proper for first-sisters who are
Maidens, we guard each other&rsquo;s backs, and neither will let a man
come to her without the other. I would not say we do not care for
men.&rdquo; Chiad nodded, with just the hint of a smile. &ldquo;Have I made the
truth clear to you, Egwene?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Egwene said faintly. She glanced at Elayne and
saw the bewilderment in her blue eyes she knew must be in her own.
<em>Not Red Ajah, Green, maybe. A cross between Warders and Green
Ajah, and I do not understand another thing out of that</em>. &ldquo;The
truth is quite clear to me, now, Bain. Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the two of you feel you are first-sisters,&rdquo; Chiad
said, &ldquo;you should go to your Wise Ones and speak the words. But you
are Wise Ones, though young. I do not know how it would be done in
that case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene did not know whether to laugh or blush. She
kept having an image of her and Elayne sharing the same man. <em>
No, that is only for first-sisters who are Maidens of the Spear.
Isn&rsquo;t it?</em> Elayne did have spots of color in her cheeks, and
Egwene was sure she was thinking of Rand. <em>But we do not share
him, Elayne. We can neither of us have him</em>.</p>

<p>Elayne cleared her throat. &ldquo;I do not think there is a
need for that, Chiad. Egwene and I already guard each other&rsquo;s
backs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can that be?&rdquo; Chiad asked slowly. &ldquo;You are not
wedded to the spear. And you are Wise Ones. Who would lift a hand
against a Wise One? This confuses me. What need have you for
guarding of backs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene was spared having to come up with an answer by
their arrival at the copse. There were two more Aiel under the
trees, deep into the thicket, but next to the river. Jolien, of the
Salt Flat sept of the Nakai Aiel, a blue-eyed woman with red-gold
hair nearly the color of Elayne&rsquo;s, was watching over Dailin, of
Aviendha&rsquo;s sept and clan. Sweat matted Dailin&rsquo;s hair, making it a
darker red, and she only opened her gray eyes once, when they first
came near, then closed them again. Her coat and shirt lay beside
her, and red stained the bandages wrapped around her middle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She took a sword,&rdquo; Aviendha said. &ldquo;Some of those
fools that the oath-breaking treekillers call soldiers thought we
were another handful of the bandits who infest this land. We had to
kill them to convince them otherwise, but Dailin&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Can you heal
her, Aes Sedai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve went to her knees beside the injured woman
and lifted the bandages enough to peer under them. She winced at
what she saw. &ldquo;Have you moved her since she was hurt? There is
scabbing, but it has been broken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She wanted to die near water,&rdquo; Aviendha said. She
glanced once at the river, then quickly away again. Egwene thought
she might have shivered, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fools!&rdquo; Nynaeve began rummaging in her pouch of
herbs. &ldquo;You could have killed her moving her with an injury like
that. She wanted to die near water!&rdquo; she said disgustedly. &ldquo;Just
because you carry weapons like men doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to think
like them.&rdquo; She pulled a deep wooden cup out of the bag and pushed
it at Chiad. &ldquo;Fill that. I need water to mix these so she can drink
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chiad and Bain stepped to the river&rsquo;s edge and
returned together. Their faces never changed, but Egwene thought
they had almost expected the river to reach up and grab them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we had not brought her here to the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;river,
Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Aviendha said, &ldquo;we would never have found you, and she
would have died anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve snorted and began sifting powdered herbs into
the cup of water, muttering to herself. &ldquo;Corenroot helps make
blood, and dogwort for knitting flesh, and healall, of course, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Her mutters trailed off into whispers too low to hear.
Aviendha was frowning at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Wise Ones use herbs, Aes Sedai, but I had not
heard that Aes Sedai used them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I use what I use!&rdquo; Nynaeve snapped and went back to
sorting through her powders and whispering to herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She truly does sound like a Wise One,&rdquo; Chiad told
Bain softly, and the other woman gave a tight nod.</p>

<p>Dailin was the only Aiel without her weapons in hand,
and they all looked ready to use them in a heartbeat. <em>Nynaeve
surely isn&rsquo;t soothing anyone</em>, Egwene thought. <em>Get them
talking about something. Anything. Nobody feels like fighting if
they&rsquo;re talking of something peaceful</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not be offended,&rdquo; she said carefully, &ldquo;but I
notice you are all uneasy about the river. It does not grow violent
unless there is a storm. You could swim in it if you wanted, though
the current is strong away from the banks.&rdquo; Elayne shook her
head.</p>

<p>The Aiel looked blank; Aviendha said, &ldquo;I saw a man&mdash;a Shienaran&mdash;do this swimming&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; Egwene said. &ldquo;I know there
isn&rsquo;t much water in the Waste, but you said you were &lsquo;Stones River
sept,&rsquo; Jolien. Surely you have swum in the Stones River?&rdquo; Elayne
looked at her as if she were mad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Swim,&rdquo; Jolien said awkwardly. &ldquo;It means&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to get
in the water? All that water? With nothing to hold on to.&rdquo; She
shuddered. &ldquo;Aes Sedai, before I crossed the Dragonwall, I had never
seen flowing water I could not step across. The Stones River&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Some claim it had water in it once, but that is only boasting.
There are only the stones. The oldest records of the Wise Ones and
the clan chief say there was never anything but stones since the
first day our sept broke off from the High Plain sept and claimed
that land. Swim!&rdquo; She gripped her spears as if to fight the very
word. Chiad and Bain moved a pace further from the riverbank.</p>

<p>Egwene sighed. And colored when she met Elayne&rsquo;s eye.
<em>Well, I am not a Daughter-Heir, to know all these things. I
will learn them, though</em>. As she looked around at the Aiel
women, she realized that far from soothing them, she had put them
even more on edge. <em>If they try anything, I will hold them with
Air</em>. She had no idea whether she could seize four people at
once, but she opened herself to <em>saidar</em>, wove the flows in
Air and held them ready. The Power pulsed in her with eagerness to
be used. No glow surrounded Elayne, and she wondered why. Elayne
looked right at her and shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would never harm an Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Aviendha said
abruptly. &ldquo;I would have you know that. Whether Dailin lives or
dies, it makes no difference in that. I would never use this&rdquo;&mdash;she lifted one short spear a trifle&mdash;&ldquo;against any
woman. And you are Aes Sedai.&rdquo; Egwene had the sudden feeling that
the woman was trying to soothe <em>them</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew that,&rdquo; Elayne said, as if talking to
Aviendha, but her eyes told Egwene the words were for her. &ldquo;No one
knows much of your people, but I was taught that Aiel never harm
women unless they are&mdash;what did you call it?&mdash;wedded to
the spear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bain seemed to think Elayne was failing to see truth
clearly again. &ldquo;That is not exactly the way of it, Elayne. If a
woman not wedded came at me with weapons, I would drub her until
she knew better of it. A man&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;A man might think a woman of
your lands was wedded if she bore weapons; I do not know. Men can
be strange.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;But so long as we do not
attack you with weapons, you will not try to harm us.&rdquo; All four
Aiel looked shocked, and she gave Egwene a quick significant
look.</p>

<p>Egwene held on to <em>saidin</em> anyway. Just
because Elayne had been taught something did not mean it was true,
even if the Aiel said the same thing. And <em>saidar</em> felt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;good in her.</p>

<p>Nynaeve lifted up Dailin&rsquo;s head and began pouring her
mixture into the woman&rsquo;s mouth. &ldquo;Drink,&rdquo; she said firmly. &ldquo;I know
it tastes bad, but drink it all.&rdquo; Dailin swallowed, choked, and
swallowed again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not even then, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Aviendha told Elayne. She
kept her eyes on Dailin and Nynaeve, though. &ldquo;It is said that once,
before the Breaking of the World, we served the Aes Sedai, though
no story says how. We failed in that service. Perhaps that is the
sin that sent us to the Three-fold Land; I do not know. No one
knows what the sin was, except maybe the Wise Ones, or the clan
chiefs, and they do not say. It is said if we fail the Aes Sedai
again, they will destroy us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drink it all,&rdquo; Nynaeve muttered. &ldquo;Swords! Swords and
muscles and no brains!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>We</em> are not going to destroy you,&rdquo; Elayne
said firmly, and Aviendha nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you say, Aes Sedai. But the old stories are all
clear on one point. We must never fight Aes Sedai. If you bring
your lightnings and your balefire against me, I will dance with
them, but I will not harm you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stabbing people,&rdquo; Nynaeve growled. She lowered
Dailin&rsquo;s head, and laid a hand on the woman&rsquo;s brow. Dailin&rsquo;s eyes
had closed again. &ldquo;Stabbing women!&rdquo; Aviendha shifted her feet and
frowned again, and she was not alone among the Aiel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Balefire,&rdquo; Egwene said. &ldquo;Aviendha, what is
balefire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aiel woman turned her frown on her. &ldquo;Do you not
know, Aes Sedai? In the old stories, Aes Sedai wielded it. The
stories make it a fearsome thing, but I know no more. It is said we
have forgotten much that we once knew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the White Tower has forgotten much, too,&rdquo;
Egwene said. <em>I knew of it in that</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>dream, or
whatever it was. It was as real as</em> Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod. <em>I&rsquo;d
gamble with Mat on that</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No right!&rdquo; Nynaeve snapped. &ldquo;No one has a right to
tear bodies so! It is not right!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she angry?&rdquo; Aviendha asked uneasily. Chiad and
Bain and Jolien exchanged worried looks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all right,&rdquo; Elayne said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is better than all right,&rdquo; Egwene added. &ldquo;She
<em>is</em> getting angry, and it is much better than all
right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The glow of <em>saidin</em> surrounded Nynaeve
suddenly&mdash;Egwene leaned forward, trying to see, and so did
Elayne&mdash;and Dailin started up with a scream, eyes wide open.
In an instant, Nynaeve was easing her back down, and the glow
faded. Dailin&rsquo;s eyes slid shut, and she lay there panting.</p>

<p><em>I saw it</em>, Egwene thought. <em>I</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>think I did</em>. She was not sure she had even been able to
make out all the many flows, much less the way Nynaeve had woven
them together. What Nynaeve had done in those few seconds had
seemed like weaving four carpets at once while blindfolded.</p>

<p>Nynaeve used the bloody bandages to wipe Dailin&rsquo;s
stomach, smearing away bright red new blood and black crusts of
dried old. There was no wound, no scar, only healthy skin
considerably paler than Dailin&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>With a grimace, Nynaeve took the bloody cloths, stood
up, and threw them into the river. &ldquo;Wash the rest of that off of
her,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and put some clothes back on her. She&rsquo;s cold. And
be ready to feed her. She will be hungry.&rdquo; She knelt by the water
to wash her hands.</p>
