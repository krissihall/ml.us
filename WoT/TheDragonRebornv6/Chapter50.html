<h4><em>The Hammer</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
afternoon sun was hot as the ferry docked in
Tear; puddles stood on the steaming stones of the dock, and the air
seemed almost as damp to Perrin as Illian&rsquo;s had. The air smelled of
pitch and wood and rope&mdash;he could see shipyards further south
along the river&mdash;of spices and iron and barley, of perfumes and
wines and a hundred different aromas he could not single out from
the melange, most coming from the warehouses behind the docks. When
the wind swirled momentarily out of the north, he caught the scents
of fish, too, but those faded as the wind swung back. No smells of
anything to hunt. His mind reached out to feel for wolves before he
realized what he was doing and snapped his guards shut. He had done
that too often of late. There had been no wolves, of course. Not in
a city like this. He wished it did not feel so&mdash;alone.</p>

<p>As soon as the ramp at the end of the barge was
lowered, he led Stepper up to the dock after Moiraine and Lan. The
huge shape of the Stone of Tear lay off to their left, shadowed so
that it looked like a mountain despite the great banner at its
highest point. He did not want to look at the Stone, but it seemed
impossible to look at the city without seeing it. <em>Is he here
yet? Light, if he has already tried to get into that, he could he
dead already</em>. And then it would all be for nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are we meant to find here?&rdquo; Zarine asked behind
him. She had not stopped asking questions; she just did not ask
them of the Aes Sedai or the Warder. &ldquo;Illian showed us Gray Men and
the Wild Hunt. What does Tear hold that&mdash;that someone wants
to keep you from so badly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin glanced around; none of the dockmen shuttling
cargo about seemed to have heard. He was sure he would have smelled
fear if they had. He bit back the sharp remark that hung on the end
of his tongue. She had a quicker tongue, and a sharper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you did not sound so eager,&rdquo; Loial rumbled.
&ldquo;You seem to think it will all be as easy as Illian, Faile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy?&rdquo; Zarine muttered. &ldquo;Easy! Loial, we were nearly
killed twice in one night. Illian was enough for a Hunter&rsquo;s song in
itself. What makes you call it easy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin grimaced. He wished Loial had not decided to
call Zarine by that name she had chosen; it was a constant reminder
that Moiraine thought she was Min&rsquo;s falcon. And it did nothing to
stop Perrin wondering if she was the beautiful woman Min had warned
him against, too. <em>At least I&rsquo;ve not run up against the hawk. Or
a Tuatha&rsquo;an with a sword! Now that would be the strangest of all,
or I am a wool merchant!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop asking questions, Zarine,&rdquo; he said as he swung
up into Stepper&rsquo;s saddle. &ldquo;You will find out why we are here when
Moiraine decides to tell you.&rdquo; He tried not to look at the
Stone.</p>

<p>She turned those dark, tilted eyes on him. &ldquo;I do not
think you know why, blacksmith. I think that is why you will not
tell me, because you cannot. Admit it, farmboy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a small sigh, he rode off the docks after
Moiraine and Lan. Zarine did not dig at Loial in that cutting way
when the Ogier refused to answer her questions. He thought she must
be trying to browbeat him into using that name. He would not.</p>

<p>Moiraine had tied the oiled cloak behind her saddle,
atop the innocuous-looking bundle that held the Dragon banner, and
despite the heat had donned the blue linen cloak from Illian. Its
deep, wide hood hid her face. Her Great Serpent ring was on a cord
around her neck. Tear, she had said, did not forbid the presence of
Aes Sedai, only channeling, but the Defenders of the Stone kept a
close eye on any woman who wore the ring. She did not want to be
watched on this visit to Tear.</p>

<p>Lan had stuffed his color-shifting cloak into his
saddlebags two days earlier, when it had become apparent that
whoever had sent the Darkhounds&mdash;<em>Sammael</em>, Perrin
thought with a shiver, and tried not to think of the name at all&mdash;whoever had sent them had not sent any more pursuit. The
Warder had made no concessions to the heat of Illian, and he made
none to the lesser heat of Tear. His gray-green coat was buttoned
up all the way.</p>

<p>Perrin wore his coat half undone, and the neck of his
shirt untied. Tear might be a little cooler than Illian, but it was
still as hot as summer in the Two Rivers, and as always after rain,
the dampness of the air made the heat seem worse. His axe belt hung
looped around the tall pommel of his saddle. It was handy there, if
he needed it, and he felt better not wearing it.</p>

<p>He was surprised at the mud in the first streets they
rode along. Only villages and smaller towns had dirt streets, that
he had seen, and Tear was one of the great cities. But the people
did not seem to mind, many going barefoot. A woman walking on
little wooden platforms caught his attention for a time, and he
wondered why they did not all wear them. Those baggy breeches on
the men looked as if they might be cooler than the snug ones he
wore, but he was sure he would feel a fool if he tried them. He
made a picture in his head of himself wearing those breeches and
one of those round straw hats, and chuckled at it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you find funny, Perrin?&rdquo; Loial asked. His
ears were drooping till their tufts were hidden in his hair, and he
looked at the people in the street worriedly. &ldquo;These folk look&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;defeated, Perrin. They did not look this way when I was here
last. Even people who let their grove be cut down do not deserve to
look like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Perrin began to study faces instead of just
looking at everything at once, he saw that Loial was right.
Something had gone out of too many of those faces. Hope, maybe.
Curiosity. They barely glanced at the party riding by, except to
get out of the way of the horses. The Ogier, mounted on an animal
as big as a draft horse, might as well have been Lan, or
Perrin.</p>

<p>The streets changed, gaining wide stone paving, after
they passed inside the gates of the high, gray city wall, past the
hard, dark eyes of soldiers in breastplates over red coats with
wide sleeves ending in narrow white cuffs, and rimmed, round
helmets with a ridge over the top. Instead of the baggy breeches
other men wore, theirs were tight, and tucked into knee-high boots.
The soldiers frowned at Lan&rsquo;s sword and fingered their own, stared
sharply at Perrin&rsquo;s axe and his bow, but in a way, despite their
frowns and sharp looks, there was something beaten in their faces,
too, as if nothing were really worth the effort any longer.</p>

<p>The buildings were larger and taller inside the
walls, though most were made no differently from those outside. The
roofs looked a bit odd to Perrin, especially those that came to
points, but he had seen so many different kinds of roof since
leaving home that he only wondered what kind of nails they used
with their tiles. In some places, the people did not use nails on
their roof tiles at all.</p>

<p>Palaces and great buildings stood among the smaller
and more ordinary, seemingly placed haphazardly; a structure of
towers and squarish, white domes, surrounded on all sides by wide
streets, might have shops and inns and houses on the other sides of
those streets. A huge hall fronted by squared columns of marble
four paces on a side, with fifty steps to climb to reach bronze
doors five spans high, had a bakery one side and a tailor on the
other.</p>

<p>More men wore coats and breeches like the soldiers&rsquo;
here, though in brighter colors and without armor, and some even
wore swords. None of them went barefoot, not even those in baggy
breeches. The women&rsquo;s dresses were often longer, their necklines
lower to bare shoulders and even bosom, the cloth as likely to be
silk as wool. The Sea Folk traded a good deal of silk through Tear.
As many sedan chairs and carriages drawn by teams of horses moved
through the streets as ox-carts and wagons. Yet too many of the
faces had that same look of having given up.</p>

<p>The inn Lan chose, the Star, had a weaver&rsquo;s shop on
one side and a smithy on the other, with narrow alleyways between.
The smithy was of undressed gray stone, the weaver&rsquo;s and the inn of
wood, though the Star stood four stories tall and had small windows
in its roof as well. The rattle of looms was hard-pressed to
compete with the clang of the smith&rsquo;s hammer. They handed their
horses over to stablemen, to be taken around back, and went inside
the inn. There were fish smells from the kitchen, baking and
perhaps stewing, and the scent of roast mutton. The men in the
common room all wore the tight coats and loose breeches; Perrin did
not think richer men&mdash;somehow he was sure the men in colorful
coats with puffy sleeves and the bare-shouldered women in bright
silk were all rich, or nobles&mdash;those folk would not put up
with the noise. Perhaps that was why Lan had chosen it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are we supposed to sleep with this racketing?&rdquo;
Zarine muttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No questions?&rdquo; he said with a smile. For a moment he
thought she was going to stick out her tongue at him.</p>

<p>The innkeeper was a round-faced, balding man in a
long, deep blue coat and those loose breeches, who bowed over hands
clasped across his stout belly. His face had that look, a weary
resignation. &ldquo;The Light shine on you, mistresses, and welcome,&rdquo; he
sighed. &ldquo;The Light shine on you, masters, and welcome.&rdquo; He gave a
small start at Perrin&rsquo;s yellow eyes, then passed wearily on to
Loial. &ldquo;The Light shine on you, friend Ogier, and welcome. It is a
year or more since I have seen one of your kind in Tear. Some work
or other at the Stone. They stayed in the Stone, of course, but I
saw them in the street one day.&rdquo; He finished with another sigh,
seemingly unable to summon any curiosity as to why another Ogier
had come to Tear, or why any of them had come, for that matter.</p>

<p>The balding man, whose name was Jurah Haret, showed
them to their rooms himself. Apparently Moiraine&rsquo;s silk dress and
the way she kept her face hidden, taken with Lan&rsquo;s hard face and
sword, made them a lady and her guard in his eyes, and so worthy of
his personal attention. Perrin he obviously took as some kind of
retainer, and Zarine he was plainly unsure of&mdash;to her visible
disgust&mdash;and Loial was, after all, an Ogier. He called men to
push beds together for Loial, and offered Moiraine a private room
for her meals if she wished. She accepted graciously.</p>

<p>They kept together through it all, making a small
procession through the upper halls until Haret bowed and sighed his
way out of their presence, leaving them all where they had begun,
outside Moiraine&rsquo;s room. The walls were white plaster, and Loial&rsquo;s
head brushed the hall ceiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Odious fellow,&rdquo; Zarine muttered, brushing furiously
at the dust on her narrow skirts with both hands. &ldquo;I believe he
took me for your handmaid, Aes Sedai. I will not stand for
that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch your tongue,&rdquo; Lan said softly. &ldquo;If you use
that name where folk can hear, you will regret it, girl.&rdquo; She
looked as if she were going to argue, but his icy blue eyes stilled
her tongue this time, if it did not cool her glare.</p>

<p>Moiraine ignored them. Staring off at nothing, she
worked her cloak in her hands almost as if wiping them. Unaware
what she was doing, in Perrin&rsquo;s opinion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do we go about finding Rand?&rdquo; he asked, but she
did not appear to hear him. &ldquo;Moiraine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remain close to the inn,&rdquo; she said after a moment.
&ldquo;Tear can be a dangerous city for those who do not know its ways.
The Pattern can be torn, here.&rdquo; That last was soft, as if to
herself. In a stronger voice she said, &ldquo;Lan, let us see what we can
discover without attracting attention. The rest of you, stay close
to the inn!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;Stay close to the inn,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; Zarine mimicked as the
Aes Sedai and the Warder disappeared down the stairs. But she said
it quietly enough that they would not hear. &ldquo;This Rand. He is the
one you called the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; If she looked like a falcon right then,
it was a very uneasy falcon. &ldquo;And we are in Tear, where the Heart
of the Stone holds&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;And the Prophecies say&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The Light
burn me, <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, is this a story I want to be in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not a story, Zarine.&rdquo; For a moment Perrin felt
almost as hopeless as the innkeeper had sounded. &ldquo;The Wheel weaves
us into the Pattern. You chose to tangle your thread with ours;
it&rsquo;s too late to untangle it, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light!&rdquo; she growled. &ldquo;Now you sound like <em>
her</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He left her there with Loial and went to put his
things in his room&mdash;it had a low bed, comfortable but small,
as city people seemed to think befitted a servant, a washstand, a
stool, and a few pegs on the cracked plaster wall&mdash;and when
he came out, they were both gone. The ring of hammer on anvil
called to him.</p>

<p>So much in Tear looked odd that it was a relief to
walk into the smithy. The ground floor was all one large room with
no back wall except for two long doors that stood open on a yard
for shoeing horses and oxen, complete with an ox sling. Hammers
stood in their stands, tongs of various kinds and sizes hung on the
exposed joists of the walls, buttresses and hoof knives and other
farrier&rsquo;s tools lay neatly arranged on wooden benches with chisels
and beak irons and swages and all the implements of the
blacksmith&rsquo;s craft. Bins held lengths of iron and steel in various
thicknesses. Five grinding wheels of different roughness stood
about the hard dirt floor, six anvils, and three stone-sided forges
with their bellows, though only one held glowing coals. Quenching
barrels stood ready to hand.</p>

<p>The smith was plying his hammer on yellow-hot iron
gripped in heavy tongs. He wore baggy breeches and had pale blue
eyes, but the long leather vest over his bare chest and apron were
not much different from those Perrin and Master Luhhan had worn
back in Emond&rsquo;s Field, and his thick arms and shoulders spoke of
years working metal. His dark hair had almost the same amount of
gray that Perrin remembered in Master Luhhan&rsquo;s. More vests and
aprons hung on the wall, as if the man had apprentices, but they
were not in evidence now. The forge-fire smelled like home. The hot
iron smelled like home.</p>

<p>The smith turned to thrust the piece he was working
back into the coals, and Perrin stepped over to work the bellows
for him. The man glanced at him, but said nothing. Perrin pulled
the bellows handle up and down with slow, steady, even strokes,
keeping the coals at the right heat. The smith went back to working
the hot iron, on the rounded horn of the anvil, this time. Perrin
thought he might be making a barrel scrape. The hammer rang with
sharp, quick blows.</p>

<p>The man spoke without looking up from his work.
&ldquo;Apprentice?&rdquo; was all he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Perrin replied just as simply.</p>

<p>The smith worked on for a time. It <em>was</em> a barrel
scrape, for cleaning the insides of wooden barrels. Now and again
he eyed Perrin consideringly. Setting his hammer down, just for a
moment, the smith picked up a short length of thick, square stock
and pushed it into Perrin&rsquo;s hand, then picked up his hammer again
and resumed work. &ldquo;See what you can do with that,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Without even thinking about it, Perrin stepped over
to an anvil on the other side of the forge and tapped the stock
against its edge. It made a nice ring. The steel had not been left
long enough in the slowfurnace to pick up a great deal of carbon
from the coal. He pushed it into the hot coals for almost its
entire length, tasted the two water barrels to see which had been
salted&mdash;the third was olive oil&mdash;then took off his coat
and shirt and chose a leather vest that would fit his chest. Most
of these Tairen fellows were not as large as he, but he found one
that would do. Finding an apron was easier.</p>

<p>When he turned around, he saw the smith, still with
his head down over his work, nodding and smiling to himself. But
just because he knew his way around a smithy did not mean he had
any skill at smithing. That was yet to be shown.</p>

<p>When he came back to the anvil with two hammers, a
set of long-handled flat-tongs, and a sharp-topped hardy, the steel
bar had heated to a dark red except for a small bit of what he had
left out of the coals. He worked the bellows, watching the color of
the metal lighten, until it reached a yellow just short of white.
Then he pulled it out with the tongs, laid it on the anvil, and
picked up the heavier of the two hammers. About ten pounds, he
estimated, and with a longer handle than most people, who did not
know metal working, thought was necessary. He held it near the end;
hot metal gave off sparks, sometimes, and he had seen the scars on
the hands of the smith from up at Roundhill, a careless fellow.</p>

<p>He did not want to make anything elaborate or fancy.
Simple things seemed best at the moment. He began by rounding the
edges of the bar, then hammered the middle out into a broad blade,
almost as thick as the original at the butt, but a good hand and a
half long. From time to time he returned the metal to the coals, to
keep it at the pale yellow, and after a time he shifted to the
lighter hammer, half the weight of the first. The piece beyond the
blade, he thinned down, then bent it over the anvil horn in a curve
down beside the blade. A wooden handle could be fixed onto that,
eventually. Setting the sharp-chisel hardy in the anvil&rsquo;s
hardy-hole, he laid the glowing metal atop it. One sharp blow of
the hammer cut off the tool he had made. Or almost made. It would
be a chamfer knife, for smoothing and leveling the tops of barrel
staves after they were hopped together, among other things. When he
was done. The other man&rsquo;s barrel scrape had made him think of
it.</p>

<p>As soon as he had made the hot-cut, he tossed the
glowing metal into the salted quenching barrel. Unsalted gave a
harder quench, for the hardest metal, while the oil gave the
softest, for good knives. And swords, he had heard, but he had
never had any part in making anything like that.</p>

<p>When the metal had cooled enough, to a dull gray, he
removed it from the water and took it to the grinding wheels. A
little slow work with the footpedals ground a polish onto the
blade. Carefully, he heated the blade portion again. This time the
colors deepened, to straw, to bronze. When the bronze color began
to run up the blade in waves, he set it aside to cool. The final
edge could be sharpened then. Quenching again would destroy the
tempering he had just done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very neat bit of work,&rdquo; the smith said. &ldquo;No wasted
motion. You looking for work? My apprentices just walked away, all
three of them, the worthless fools, and I&rsquo;ve plenty you could
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin shook his head. &ldquo;I do not know how long I will
be in Tear. I&rsquo;d like to work a little longer, if you do not mind.
It has been a long time, and I miss it. Maybe I could do some of
the work your apprentices would have done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The smith snorted loudly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a deal better than
any of those louts, moping around and staring, muttering about
their nightmares. As if everyone doesn&rsquo;t have nightmares,
sometimes. Yes, you can work here, as long as you want. Light, I&rsquo;ve
orders for a dozen drawknives and three cooper&rsquo;s adzes, and a
carpenter down the street needs a mortise hammer, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Too
much to list it. Start with the drawknives, and we will see how far
we get before night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin lost himself in the work, for a time
forgetting everything but the heat of the metal, the ring of his
hammer, and the smell of the forge, but there came a time when he
looked up and found the smith&mdash;Dermid Ajala, he had said his
name was&mdash;taking off his vest, and the shoeing yard dark. All
the light came from the forge and a pair of lamps. And Zarine was
sitting on an anvil by one of the cold forges, watching him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you really are a blacksmith, blacksmith,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is that, mistress,&rdquo; Ajala said. &ldquo;Apprentice, he
says, but the work he did today amounts to his master&rsquo;s piece as
far as I am concerned. Fine stroking, and better than steady.&rdquo;
Perrin shifted his feet at the compliments, and the smith grinned
at him. Zarine stared at both of them with a lack of
comprehension.</p>

<p>Perrin went to replace the vest and apron on their
peg, but once he had them off, he was suddenly conscious of
Zarine&rsquo;s eyes on his back. It was if she were touching him; for a
moment, the herbal scent of her seemed overwhelming. He quickly
pulled his shirt over his head, stuffed it raggedly into his
breeches, and jerked on his coat. When he turned around, Zarine
wore one of those small, secretive smiles that had always made him
nervous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this what you mean to do, then?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Did
you come all this way to be a blacksmith again?&rdquo; Ajala paused in
the act of pulling the yard doors closed and listened.</p>

<p>Perrin picked up the heavy hammer he had used, a
ten-pound head with a handle as long as his forearm. It felt good
in his hands. It felt right. The smith had glanced at his eyes once
and never even blinked; it was the work that was important, the
skill with metal, not the color of a man&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said
sadly. &ldquo;One day, I hope. But not yet.&rdquo; He started to hang the
hammer back on the wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take it.&rdquo; Ajala cleared his throat. &ldquo;I do not
usually give away good hammers, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The work you&rsquo;ve done
today is worth more than the price of that hammer by far, and maybe
it will help you to that &lsquo;one day.&rsquo; Man, if I have ever seen anyone
made to hold a smith&rsquo;s hammer, it is you. So take it. Keep it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin closed his hand around the haft. It did feel
right. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I cannot say what this means to
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just remember the &lsquo;one day,&rsquo; man. Just you remember
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As they left, Zarine looked up at him and said, &ldquo;Do
you have any idea how strange men are, blacksmith? No. I did not
think you did.&rdquo; She darted ahead, leaving him holding the hammer in
one hand and scratching his head with the other.</p>

<p>No one in the common room looked at him twice, a
golden-eyed man carrying a smith&rsquo;s hammer. He went up to his room,
remembering for once to light a tallow candle. His quiver and the
axe hung from the same peg on the plaster wall. He hefted the axe
in one hand, the hammer in the other. By weight of metal, the axe,
with its half-moon blade and thick spike, was a good five or six
pounds lighter than the hammer, but it felt ten times heavier.
Replacing the axe in the loop on its belt, he set the hammer on the
floor beneath the peg, handle against the wall. Axe haft and hammer
haft almost touched, two pieces of wood equally thick. Two pieces
of metal, near enough the same weight. For a long time he sat on
the stool staring at them. He was still staring when Lan put his
head into the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, blacksmith. We have things to talk over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>am</em> a blacksmith,&rdquo; Perrin said, and the
Warder frowned at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go winter-crazy on me now, blacksmith. If you
cannot carry your weight any longer, you may drag us all down the
mountain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll carry my weight,&rdquo; Perrin growled. &ldquo;I will do
what has to be done. What do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, blacksmith. Don&rsquo;t you listen? Come on,
farmboy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That name that Zarine so often called him pulled him
to his feet angrily, now, but Lan was already turning away. Perrin
hurried into the hall and followed him toward the front of the inn,
meaning to tell the Warder he had had enough of this &ldquo;blacksmith&rdquo;
and &ldquo;farmboy,&rdquo; his name was Perrin Aybara. The Warder ducked into
the inn&rsquo;s only private dining room, overlooking the street.</p>

<p>Perrin followed him. &ldquo;Now listen, <em>Warder</em>, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You listen, Perrin,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;Be quiet and
listen.&rdquo; Her face was smooth, but her eyes looked as grim as her
voice sounded.</p>

<p>Perrin had not realized anyone was in the room except
for himself and the Warder, standing with one arm up on the mantel
of the unlit fireplace. Moiraine sat at the table in the middle of
the floor, a simple piece, of black oak. None of the other chairs
with their high, carved backs were occupied. Zarine was leaning
against the wall at the other end of the room from Lan, scowling,
and Loial had chosen to sit on the floor since none of the chairs
really fit him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you decided to join us, farmboy,&rdquo; Zarine
said sarcastically. &ldquo;Moiraine would not say anything till you came.
She just looks at us as if she is deciding which of us is going to
die. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet,&rdquo; Moiraine told her sharply. &ldquo;One of the
Forsaken is in Tear. The High Lord Samon is Be&rsquo;lal.&rdquo; Perrin
shivered.</p>

<p>Loial squeezed his eyes shut and groaned. &ldquo;I could
have remained in the <em>stedding</em>. I would probably have been
very happy, married, whoever my mother chose. She is a fine woman,
my mother, and she would not give me to a bad wife.&rdquo; His ears
seemed to have hidden themselves completely in his shaggy hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can go back to Stedding Shangtai,&rdquo; Moiraine
said. &ldquo;Leave now, if you wish. I will not stop you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial opened one eye. &ldquo;I can go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you wish,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; He opened the other eye, and scratched his
cheek with blunt fingers the size of sausages. &ldquo;I suppose&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I
suppose&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;if I have a choice&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that I will stay with all of
you. I have taken a great many notes, but not nearly enough to
complete my book, and I would not like to leave Perrin, and Rand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine cut him off in a cold voice. &ldquo;Good, Loial. I
am glad that you are staying. I will be glad to use any knowledge
you have. But until this is done, I have no time to listen to your
complaints!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; Zarine said in an unsteady voice, &ldquo;that
there is no chance of me leaving?&rdquo; She looked at Moiraine, and
shivered. &ldquo;I thought not. Blacksmith, if I live through this, I
will make you pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin stared at her. <em>Me! The fool woman thinks
it my fault? Did I ask her to come?</em> He opened his mouth, saw
the look in Moiraine&rsquo;s eyes, and closed it again quickly. After a
moment he said, &ldquo;Is he after Rand? To stop him, or kill him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; she said quietly. Her voice was like
cold steel. &ldquo;I fear he means to let Rand enter the Heart of the
Stone and take <em>Callandor</em>, then take it away from him. I
fear he means to kill the Dragon Reborn with the very weapon that
is meant to herald him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do we run again?&rdquo; Zarine said. &ldquo;Like Illian? I never
thought to run, but I never thought to find the Forsaken when I
took the Hunter&rsquo;s oath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This time,&rdquo; Moiraine said, &ldquo;we do not run. We dare
not run. Worlds and time rest on Rand, on the Dragon Reborn. This
time, we fight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin took a chair uneasily. &ldquo;Moiraine, you are
saying a lot of things right out that you told us we must not even
think about. You <em>do</em> have this room warded against
listening, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; When she shook her head, he gripped the edge
of the table hard enough to make the dark oak creak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not speak of a Myrddraal, Perrin. No one knows
the strength of the Forsaken, except that Ishamael and Lanfear were
the strongest, but the weakest of them could sense any warding I
might set from a mile or more away. And rip all of us to shreds in
seconds. Possibly without stirring from where he stood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re saying he can tie you in knots,&rdquo; Perrin
muttered. &ldquo;Light! What are we supposed to do? How can we do
anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even the Forsaken cannot stand up to balefire,&rdquo; she
said. He wondered if that was what she had used on the Darkhounds;
it still made him uneasy, what he had seen, and what she had said
then. &ldquo;I have learned things in the last year, Perrin. I am&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;more dangerous than when I came to Emond&rsquo;s Field. If I can come
close enough to Be&rsquo;lal, I can destroy him. But if he sees me first,
he can destroy us all, long before I have a chance.&rdquo; She turned her
attention to Loial. &ldquo;What can you tell me of Be&rsquo;lal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin blinked in confusion. <em>Loial?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you asking him?&rdquo; Zarine burst out angrily.
&ldquo;First you tell the blacksmith you mean us to fight one of the
Forsaken!&mdash;who can kill us all before we can even think!&mdash;and now you ask Loial about him?&rdquo; Loial murmured urgently,
that name she used&mdash;&ldquo;Faile! Faile!&rdquo;&mdash;but she did not
even slow. &ldquo;I thought Aes Sedai knew everything. Light, at least I
am smart enough not to say I will fight someone unless I know
everything I can of him! You&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She trailed off under
Moiraine&rsquo;s stare, muttering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ogier,&rdquo; the Aes Sedai said coolly, &ldquo;have long
memories, girl. It has been well over a hundred generations since
the Breaking for humans, but less than thirty for Ogier. We still
learn things from their stories that we did not know. Now tell me,
Loial. What do you know of Be&rsquo;lal. And briefly, for once. I want
your long memory, not your long wind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial cleared his throat, a sound much like firewood
tumbling down a chute. &ldquo;Be&rsquo;lal.&rdquo; His ears flickered out of his hair
like hummingbird wings, then snapped down again. &ldquo;I do not know
what can be in the stories about him you do not already know. He is
not much mentioned, except in the razing of the Hall of the
Servants just before Lews Therin Kinslayer and the Hundred
Companions sealed him up with the Dark One. Jalanda son of Aried
son of Coiam wrote that he was called the Envious, that he forsook
the Light because he envied Lews Therin, and that he envied
Ishamael and Lanfear, too. In <em>A Study of the War of the
Shadow</em>, Moilin daughter of Hamada daughter of Juendan called
Be&rsquo;lal the Netweaver, but I do not know why. She mentioned him
playing a game of stones with Lews Therin and winning, and that he
always boasted of it.&rdquo; He glanced at Moiraine and rumbled, &ldquo;I am
trying to be brief. I do not know anything important about him.
Several writers say Be&rsquo;lal and Sammael were both leaders in the
fight against the Dark One before they forsook the Light, and both
were masters of the sword. That is truly all I know. He may be
mentioned in other books, other stories, but I have not read them.
Be&rsquo;lal is just not spoken of very often. I am sorry I could not
tell you anything useful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you have,&rdquo; Moiraine told him. &ldquo;I did not
know of the name, the Netweaver. Or that he envied the Dragon as
well as his companions in the Shadow. That strengthens my belief
that he wants <em>Callandor</em>. That must be the reason he has
chosen to make himself a High Lord of Tear. And the Netweaver&mdash;a name for a schemer, a patient and cunning planner. You
have done well, Loial.&rdquo; For a moment the Ogier&rsquo;s wide mouth curved
up in a pleased smile, but then it curved down again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not pretend I am not afraid,&rdquo; Zarine said
suddenly. &ldquo;Only a fool would not be afraid of the Forsaken. But I
swore I would be one of you, and I will. That is all that I wanted
to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin shook his head. <em>She</em> must <em>be
crazy. I could wish I were not one of this party. I could wish I
were back home working Master Luhhan&rsquo;s forge</em>. Aloud, he said,
&ldquo;If he is inside the Stone, if he is waiting there for Rand, we
must go inside to reach him. How do we do that? Everyone keeps
saying no one enters the Stone without the permission of the High
Lords, and looking at it, I don&rsquo;t see any way but through the
gates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not go in,&rdquo; Lan said. &ldquo;Moiraine and I will be
the only ones to enter. The more who go, the harder it will be.
Whatever way in I find, I cannot believe it will be easy even for
only two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gaidin,&rdquo; Moiraine began in a firm voice, but the
Warder cut her off with one just as firm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We go together, Moiraine. I will not stand aside
this time.&rdquo; After a moment she nodded. Perrin thought he saw Lan
relax. &ldquo;The rest of you had better get some sleep,&rdquo; the Warder went
on. &ldquo;I have to be out studying the Stone.&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;There is a
thing that your news drove out of my head, Moiraine. A small thing,
and I cannot see what it might mean. There are Aiel in Tear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aiel!&rdquo; Loial exclaimed. &ldquo;Impossible! The entire city
would be in a panic if one Aiel came through the gates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not say they were walking the streets, Ogier.
The rooftops and chimneys of the city make as good hiding as the
Waste. I saw no less than three, though apparently no one else in
Tear has seen any of them. And if I saw three, you can be sure
there are many times that I did not see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It means nothing to me,&rdquo; Moiraine said slowly.
&ldquo;Perrin, why are you frowning in that way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had not known that he was frowning. &ldquo;I was
thinking about that Aiel in Remen. He said that when the Stone
falls, the Aiel will leave the Three-fold Land. That&rsquo;s the Waste,
isn&rsquo;t it? He said it was a prophecy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have read every word of the Prophecies of the
Dragon,&rdquo; Moiraine said softly, &ldquo;in every translation, and there is
no mention of the Aiel. We stagger blindly while Be&rsquo;lal weaves his
nets, and the Wheel weaves the Pattern around us. But are the Aiel
the Wheel&rsquo;s weaving, or Be&rsquo;lal&rsquo;s? Lan, you must find me the way
into the Stone quickly. Us. Find us a way in quickly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you command, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; he said, but his tone
was more warm than formal. He vanished through the door. Moiraine
frowned at the table, eyes clouded in thought.</p>

<p>Zarine came over to look down at Perrin, her head
tilted to one side. &ldquo;And what are you going to do, blacksmith? It
seems they mean us to wait and watch while they go adventuring. Not
that I will complain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He doubted that last. &ldquo;First,&rdquo; he told her, &ldquo;I am
going to have something to eat. And then I am going to think about
a hammer.&rdquo; <em>And try to puzzle out how I feel about you.
Falcon</em>.</p>
