<h4><em>The Amyrlin Seat</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">S</span>iuan
Sanche paced the length of her study, pausing
now and again to glance, with a blue-eyed gaze that had made rulers
stammer, at a carved nightwood box on a long table centered in the
room. She hoped she would not have to use any of the carefully
drawn documents within it. They had been prepared and sealed in
secret, by her own hand, to cover a dozen possible eventualities.
She had laid a warding on the box so that if any hand but hers
opened it, the contents would flash to ash in an instant; very
likely the box itself would burst into flame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And burn the thieving fisher-bird, whoever she might
be, so she never forgets it, I hope,&rdquo; she muttered. For the
hundredth time since being told that Verin had returned, she
readjusted her stole on her shoulders without realizing what she
was doing. It hung below her waist, broad and striped with the
colors of the seven Ajahs. The Amyrlin Seat was of all Ajahs and of
none, no matter from which she had been raised.</p>

<p>The room was ornate, for it had belonged to
generations of women who had worn the stole. The tall fireplace and
broad, cold hearth were all carved golden marble from Kandor, and
the diamond-shaped floor tiles, polished redstone from the
Mountains of Mist. The walls were panels of some pale striped wood,
hard as iron and carved in fantastic beasts and birds of
unbelievable plumage, panels brought from the lands beyond the Aiel
Waste by the Sea Folk before Artur Hawkwing was born. Tall, arched
windows, open now to let in the new, green smells, let onto a
balcony overlooking her small private garden, where she seldom had
time to walk.</p>

<p>All that grandeur was in stark contrast to the
furnishings Siuan Sanche had brought to the room. The one table and
the stout chair behind it were plain, if well polished with age and
beeswax, as was the only other chair in the room. That stood off to
one side, close enough to be drawn up if she wished a visitor to
sit. A small Tairen rug lay in front of the table, woven in simple
patterns of blue and brown and gold. A single drawing, tiny fishing
boats among reeds, hung above the fireplace. Half a dozen stands
held open books about the floor. That was all. Even the lamps would
not have been out of place in a farmer&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>Siuan Sanche had been born poor in Tear, and had
worked on her father&rsquo;s fishing boat, one just like the boats in the
drawing, in the delta called the Fingers of the Dragon, before ever
she dreamed of coming to Tar Valon. Even the nearly ten years since
she had been raised to the Seat had not made her comfortable with
too much luxury. Her bedchamber was more simple still.</p>

<p><em>Ten years with the stole</em>, she thought. <em>
Nearly twenty since I decided to sail these dangerous waters. And
if I slip now, I&rsquo;ll wish I were back hauling nets</em>.</p>

<p>She spun at a sound. Another Aes Sedai had slipped
into the room, a copper-skinned woman with dark hair cut short. She
caught herself in time to keep her voice steady and say only what
was expected. &ldquo;Yes, Leane?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Keeper of the Chronicles bowed, just as deeply as
she would had others been present. The tall Aes Sedai, as tall as
most men, was second only to the Amyrlin in the White Tower, and
though Siuan had known her since they were novices together,
sometimes Leane&rsquo;s insistence on upholding the dignity of the
Amyrlin Seat was enough to make Siuan want to scream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Verin is here, Mother, asking leave to speak with
you. I have told her you are busy, but she asks&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not too busy to speak to her,&rdquo; Siuan said. Too
quickly, she knew, but she did not care. &ldquo;Send her in. There&rsquo;s no
need for you to remain, Leane. I will speak to her alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A twitch of her eyebrows was the Keeper&rsquo;s only sign
of surprise. The Amyrlin seldom saw anyone, even a queen, without
the Keeper present. But the Amyrlin was the Amyrlin. Leane bowed
her way out, and in moments Verin took her place, kneeling to kiss
the Great Serpent ring on Siuan&rsquo;s finger. The Brown sister had a
good-sized leather sack under her arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you for seeing me, Mother,&rdquo; Verin said as she
straightened. &ldquo;I have urgent news from Falme. And more. I scarcely
know where to begin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Begin where you will,&rdquo; Siuan said. &ldquo;These rooms are
warded, in case anyone thinks to use childhood tricks of
eavesdropping.&rdquo; Verin&rsquo;s eyebrows lifted in surprise, and the
Amyrlin added, &ldquo;Much has changed since you left. Speak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most importantly, then, Rand al&rsquo;Thor has proclaimed
himself the Dragon Reborn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Siuan felt a tightness loosen in her chest. &ldquo;I hoped
it was he,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;I have had reports from women who
could only tell what they had heard, and rumors by the score come
with every trader&rsquo;s boat and merchant&rsquo;s wagon, but I could not be
sure.&rdquo; She took a deep breath. &ldquo;Yet I think I can name the day it
happened. Did you know the two false Dragons no longer trouble the
world?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had not heard, Mother. That is good news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Mazrim Taim is in the hands of our sisters in
Saldaea, and the poor fellow in Haddon Mirk, the Light have pity on
his soul, was taken by the Tairens and executed on the spot. No one
even seems to know what his name was. Both were taken on the same
day and, according to rumor, under the same circumstances. They
were in battle, and winning, when suddenly a great light flashed in
the sky, and a vision appeared, just for an instant. There are a
dozen different versions of what it was, but in both cases the
result was exactly the same. The false Dragon&rsquo;s horse reared up and
threw him. He was knocked unconscious, and his followers cried out
that he was dead, and fled the field, and he was taken. Some of my
reports speak of visions in the sky at Falme. I&rsquo;ll wager a gold
mark to a week-old delta perch that was the instant Rand al&rsquo;Thor
proclaimed himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The true Dragon has been Reborn,&rdquo; Verin said almost
to herself, &ldquo;and so the Pattern has no room for false Dragons
anymore. We have loosed the Dragon Reborn on the world. The Light
have mercy on us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin shook her head irritably. &ldquo;We have done
what must be done.&rdquo; <em>And if even the newest novice learns of it,
I will be stilled before the next sunrise, if I&rsquo;m not torn to
pieces flat. Me, and Moiraine, and Verin, and likely anyone thought
to be a friend of ours, as well</em>. It was not easy to carry on
so great a conspiracy when only three women knew of it, when even a
close friend would betray them and consider it a duty well done.
<em>Light, but I wish I could be sure they would not be right to do
it</em>. &ldquo;At least he is safely in Moiraine&rsquo;s hands. She will guide
him, and do what must be done. What else have you to tell me,
Daughter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For answer, Verin placed the leather sack on the
table and took out a curled, gold horn, with silver script inlaid
around its flaring bell mouth. She laid the horn on the table, then
looked to the Amyrlin with quiet expectation.</p>

<p>Siuan did not have to be close enough to read the
script to know what it said. <em>Tia mi aven Moridin isainde
vadin</em>. &ldquo;The grave is no bar to my call.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Horn of Valere?&rdquo;
she gasped. &ldquo;You brought that all the way here, across hundreds of
leagues, with the Hunters looking everywhere for it? Light, woman,
it was to be left with Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know, Mother,&rdquo; Verin said calmly, &ldquo;but the Hunters
all expect to find the Horn in some great adventure, not in a sack
with four women escorting a sick youth. And it would do Rand no
good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean? He is to fight Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don. The
Horn is to summon dead heroes from the grave to fight in the Last
Battle. Has Moiraine once again made some new plan without
consulting me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is none of Moiraine&rsquo;s doing, Mother. We plan,
but the Wheel weaves the Pattern as it wills. Rand was not first to
sound the Horn. Matrim Cauthon did that. And Mat now lies below,
dying of his ties to the Shadar Logoth dagger. Unless he can be
Healed here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Siuan shivered. Shadar Logoth, that dead city so
tainted that even Trollocs feared to enter, and with reason. By
chance, a dagger from that place had come into young Mat&rsquo;s hands,
twisting and tainting him with the evil that had killed the city
long ago. Killing him. <em>By chance? Or by the Pattern? He is</em>
ta&rsquo;veren, <em>too, after all. But</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Mat <em>sounded the
Horn. Then&mdash;</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;So long as Mat lives,&rdquo; Verin went on, &ldquo;the Horn of
Valere is no more than a horn to anyone else. If he dies, of
course, another can sound it and forge a new link between man and
Horn.&rdquo; Her gaze was steady and untroubled by what she seemed to be
suggesting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many will die before we are done, Daughter.&rdquo; <em>And
who else could I use to sound it again? I&rsquo;ll not take the risk of
trying to return it to Moiraine, now. One of the Gaidin, perhaps.
Perhaps</em>. &ldquo;The Pattern has yet to make his fate clear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mother. And the Horn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the moment,&rdquo; the Amyrlin said finally, &ldquo;we will
find some place to hide this where no one but we two know. I will
consider what to do after that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verin nodded. &ldquo;As you say, Mother. Of course, a few
hours will make one decision for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that all you have for me?&rdquo; Siuan snapped. &ldquo;If it
is, I have those three runaways to deal with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is the matter of the Seanchan, Mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What of them? All my reports say they have fled back
across the ocean, or to wherever they came from.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems so, Mother. But I fear we may have to deal
with them again.&rdquo; Verin pulled a small leather notebook from behind
her belt and began leafing through it. &ldquo;They spoke of themselves as
the Forerunners, or Those Who Come Before, and talked of the
Return, and of reclaiming this land as theirs. I&rsquo;ve taken notes on
everything I heard of them. Only from those who actually saw them,
of course, or had dealings with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Verin, you are worrying about a lionfish out in the
Sea of Storms, while here and now the silverpike are chewing our
nets to shreds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Brown sister continued turning pages. &ldquo;An apt
metaphor, Mother, the lionfish. Once I saw a large shark that a
lionfish had chased into the shallows, where it died.&rdquo; She tapped
one page with a finger. &ldquo;Yes. This is the worst. Mother, the
Seanchan use the One Power in battle. They use it as a weapon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Siuan clasped her hands tightly at her waist. The
reports the pigeons had brought spoke of that, too. Most had only
secondhand knowledge, but a few women wrote of seeing for
themselves. The Power used as a weapon. Even dry ink on paper
carried an edge of hysteria when they wrote of that. &ldquo;That is
already causing us trouble, Verin, and will cause more as the
stories spread, and grow with the spreading. But I can do nothing
about that. I am told these people are gone, Daughter. Do you have
any evidence otherwise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, no, Mother, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Until you do, let us deal with getting the
silverpike out of our nets before they start chewing holes in the
boat, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With reluctance, Verin closed the notebook and tucked
it back behind her belt. &ldquo;As you say, Mother. If I might ask, what
do you intend to do to Nynaeve and the other two girls?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin hesitated, considering. &ldquo;Before I am done
with them, they will wish they could go down to the river and sell
themselves for fishbait.&rdquo; It was the simple truth, but it could be
taken in more than one way. &ldquo;Now. Seat yourself, and tell me
everything those three have said and done in the time they were
with you. Everything.&rdquo;</p>
