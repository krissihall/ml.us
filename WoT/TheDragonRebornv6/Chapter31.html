<h4><em>The Woman of Tanchico</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
common room of the inn was brightly lit, the
tables not near a quarter full so late. A few white-aproned serving
women with mugs of ale or wine passed among the men, and a low
murmur of talk ran under the sound of a harp being strummed and
plucked. The patrons, some with pipes clenched in their teeth and
one pair hunched over a stones board, had the look of ship&rsquo;s
officers and minor merchants from the smaller houses, their coats
well cut and of fine wool, but with none of the gold or silver or
embroidery that richer men might have had. And for once there was
no clack and rattle of dice to be heard. Fires blazed on the long
hearths at the ends of the room, but even without those there would
have been a warm feeling about the place.</p>

<p>The harper stood on a tabletop, reciting &ldquo;Mara and
the Three Foolish Kings,&rdquo; to the music of his harp. His instrument,
all worked in gold and silver, was fit for a palace. Mat knew him.
He had saved Mat&rsquo;s life, once.</p>

<p>The harper was a lean man who would have been tall
except for a stoop, and he moved with a limp when he shifted his
footing on the tabletop. Even here inside, he wore his cloak, all
covered with fluttering patches in a hundred colors. He always
wanted everyone to know he was a gleeman. His long mustaches and
bushy eyebrows were as snow-white as the thick hair on his head,
and his blue eyes held a look of sorrow as he recited. The look was
as unexpected as the man. Mat had never known Thom Merrilin to be a
sorrowful man.</p>

<p>He took a table, setting his things on the floor by
his stool, and ordered two mugs. The pretty young serving girl&rsquo;s
big brown eyes twinkled at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two, young master? You do not look such a
hard-drinking man as that.&rdquo; Her voice held a mischievous edge of
laughter.</p>

<p>After rummaging a bit, he brought out two silver
pennies from his pocket. One more than paid for the wine, but he
slipped her another for her eyes. &ldquo;My friend will be joining
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He knew Thom had seen him. The old gleeman had nearly
stopped the story dead when Mat came in. That was new, too. Few
things startled Thom enough for him to let it show, and nothing
short of Trollocs had ever made him stop a story in the middle that
Mat knew. When the girl brought the wine and his coppers in change,
he let the pewter mugs sit and listened to the end of the
story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;It was as we have said it should be,&rsquo; said King
Madel, trying to untangle a fish from his long beard.&rdquo; Thom&rsquo;s voice
seemed almost to echo inside a great hall, not an ordinary common
room. His plucked harp sounded the three kings&rsquo; final foolishness.
&ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;It was as we said it would be,&rsquo; announced Orander. And, feet
slipping in the mud, he sat down with a great splash. &lsquo;It was as we
said it must be,&rsquo; proclaimed Kadar as he searched, up to his elbows
in the river, for his crown. &lsquo;The woman knows not whereof she
speaks. She is the fool!&rsquo; Madel and Orander agreed with him loudly.
And with that, Mara had had enough. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve given them all the
chances they deserve and more,&rsquo; she murmured to herself. Slipping
Kadar&rsquo;s crown into her bag with the first two, she climbed back
onto her cart, clucked to her mare, and drove straight back to her
village. And when Mara had told them all that happened, the people
of Heape would have no king at all.&rdquo; He strummed the major theme of
the kings&rsquo; foolishness once more, this time sliding to a crescendo
that sounded even more like laughter, made a sweeping bow, and
nearly fell off the table.</p>

<p>Men laughed and stamped their feet, though likely
every one of them had heard the story many times before, and called
for more. The story of Mara was always well received, except
perhaps by kings.</p>

<p>Thom nearly fell again climbing down from the table,
and he was more unsteady in his walk than a somewhat stiff leg
could account for as he came to where Mat was sitting. Casually
putting his harp on the table, he dropped onto a stool in front of
the second mug and gave Mat a flat stare. His eyes had always been
sharp as awls, but they seemed to be having trouble focusing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Common,&rdquo; he muttered. His voice was still deep, but
it no longer seemed to reverberate. &ldquo;The tale is a hundred times
better in Plain Chant, and a thousand in High, but they want
Common.&rdquo; Without another word, he buried his face in his wine.</p>

<p>Mat could not recall ever seeing Thom finish playing
that harp without immediately putting it away in its hard leather
case. He had never seen him the worse for drink. It was a relief to
hear the gleeman complaining about his listeners; Thom never
thought their standards were as high as his. At least something of
him had not changed.</p>

<p>The serving girl was back, with no twinkle in her
eyes. &ldquo;Oh, Thom,&rdquo; she said softly, then rounded on Mat. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d
known he was the friend you awaited, I&rsquo;d not have brought you wine
for him if you gave a hundred silver pence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not know he was drunk,&rdquo; Mat protested.</p>

<p>But her attention was back on Thom, her voice gentle
again. &ldquo;Thom, you need some rest. They&rsquo;ll keep you telling stories
all night and all day, if you let them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another woman appeared on Thom&rsquo;s other side, lifting
her apron off over her head. She was older than the first, but no
less pretty. The two might have been sisters. &ldquo;A beautiful story,
I&rsquo;ve always thought, Thom, and you tell it beautifully. Come, I&rsquo;ve
slipped a warming pan into your bed, and you can tell me all about
the court in Caemlyn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom peered into the mug as if surprised to find it
empty, then blew out his long mustaches and looked from one woman
to the other. &ldquo;Pretty Mada. Pretty Saal. Did I ever tell you that
two pretty women have loved me in my life? That is more than most
men can claim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve told us all about it, Thom,&rdquo; the older woman
said sadly. The younger glared at Mat as if this were all his
fault.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two,&rdquo; Thom murmured. &ldquo;Morgase had a temper, but I
thought I could ignore that, so it ended with her wanting to kill
me. Dena, I killed. As good as. Not much difference. Two chances
I&rsquo;ve had, more than most, and I threw them both away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will take care of him,&rdquo; Mat said. Mada and Saal
were both glaring at him, now. He gave them his best smile, but it
did not work. His stomach muttered loudly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I smell chicken
roasting? Bring me three or four.&rdquo; The two women blinked and
exchanged startled looks when he added, &ldquo;Do you want something to
eat, too, Thom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could do with more of this fine Andoran wine.&rdquo; The
gleeman raised his cup hopefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more wine for you tonight, Thom.&rdquo; The older woman
would have taken his cup if he had let her.</p>

<p>Almost on top of the first woman, the younger said,
in a mixture of firmness and pleading, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have some chicken,
Thom. It is very good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neither would leave until the gleeman agreed to eat
something, and when they did go, they gave Mat such a combination
of stares and sniffs that he could only shake his head. <em>Burn
me, you would think I was encouraging him to drink more! Women! But
pretty eyes on the pair of them</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand said you were alive,&rdquo; he told Thom when Mada
and Saal were out of hearing. &ldquo;Moiraine always said she thought you
were. But I heard you were in Cairhien, and meaning to go on to
Tear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand is still well, then?&rdquo; Thom&rsquo;s eyes sharpened to
almost the keenness Mat remembered. &ldquo;I am not sure I expected that.
Moiraine is still with him, is she? A fine-looking woman. A fine
woman, if she were not Aes Sedai. Meddle with that sort, and you
get more than your fingers burned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t you expect Rand to be all right?&rdquo; Mat
asked carefully. &ldquo;Do you know of something that could harm
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Know? I don&rsquo;t know anything, boy. I suspect more
than is healthy for me, but I know nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat abandoned that line of talk. <em>No use firming
his suspicions. No use letting him know I know more than&rsquo;s healthy
myself</em>.</p>

<p>The older woman&mdash;Thom called her Mada&mdash;came back with three chickens with crisp, brown skins, giving the
white-haired man a worried look, and Mat a warning one, before she
left. Mat ripped off a leg and set to as he talked. Thom frowned
into his cup and never looked at the birds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you here in Tar Valon, Thom? It&rsquo;s the last
place I&rsquo;d have expected to see you, the way you feel about Aes
Sedai. I heard you were coining money in Cairhien.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cairhien,&rdquo; the old gleeman muttered, the sharpness
fading from his eyes again. &ldquo;Such trouble it causes killing a man,
even when he deserves killing.&rdquo; He made a flourish with one hand
and was holding a knife. Thom always had knives secreted about him.
Drunk he might have been, but he held the blade steady enough.
&ldquo;Kill a man who needs killing, and sometimes others pay for it. The
question is, was it worth doing anyway? There&rsquo;s always a balance,
you know. Good and evil. Light and Shadow. We would not be human if
there wasn&rsquo;t a balance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put that away,&rdquo; Mat growled around a mouthful. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want to talk about killing.&rdquo; <em>Light, that fellow is still
lying right out there in the street. Burn me, I ought to be on a
ship by now</em>. &ldquo;I just asked why you&rsquo;re in Tar Valon. If you had
to leave Cairhien because you killed someone, I do not want to know
about it. Blood and ashes, if you can&rsquo;t pull your wits out of the
wine enough to talk straight, I&rsquo;ll leave now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a sour look, Thom made the knife disappear. &ldquo;Why
am I in Tar Valon? I&rsquo;m here because it is the worst place I could
be, except maybe Caemlyn. It&rsquo;s what I deserve, boy. Some of the Red
Ajah still remember me. I saw Elaida in the street the other day.
If she knew I was here, she would peel my hide off in strips, and
then she would stop being pleasant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never knew you to feel sorry for yourself,&rdquo; Mat
said disgustedly. &ldquo;Do you mean to drown yourself in wine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you know of it, boy?&rdquo; Thom snarled. &ldquo;Put a
few years on you, see something of life, maybe love a woman or two,
and then you&rsquo;ll know. Perhaps you will, if you have the brains to
learn. Aaaah! You want to know why I&rsquo;m in Tar Valon? Why are you in
Tar Valon? I remember you shivering when you found out Moiraine was
Aes Sedai. You nearly soiled yourself every time anybody even
mentioned the Power. What are you doing in Tar Valon, with Aes
Sedai on every side?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am leaving Tar Valon. That&rsquo;s what I am doing here.
Leaving!&rdquo; Mat grimaced. The gleeman had saved his life, and maybe
more. A Fade had been involved. That was why Thom&rsquo;s right leg did
not work as well as it should. <em>There could not be enough wine
on a ship to keep him this drunk</em>. &ldquo;I am going to Caemlyn,
Thom. If you need to risk your fool life for some reason, why not
come with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Caemlyn?&rdquo; Thom said musingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Caemlyn, Thom. Elaida will likely be going back
there sooner or later, so you&rsquo;d have her to worry about. And from
what I remember, if Morgase puts her hands on you, you will wish
Elaida had you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Caemlyn. Yes. Caemlyn would fit my mood like a
glove.&rdquo; The gleeman glanced at the chicken platter and gave a
start. &ldquo;What did you do, boy? Stuff them up your sleeve?&rdquo; There was
nothing left of the three birds but bones and carcasses with only a
few strips of flesh remaining.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I get hungry,&rdquo; Mat muttered. It was an
effort not to lick his fingers. &ldquo;Are you coming with me, or
not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I will come, boy.&rdquo; As Thom pushed himself to his
feet, he did not seem as unsteady as he had been. &ldquo;You wait here&mdash;and try not to eat the table&mdash;while I get my things
and say some goodbyes.&rdquo; He limped away, not staggering once.</p>

<p>Mat drank a little of his wine and stripped off a few
shreds that were left on the chicken carcasses, wondering if he had
time to order another, but Thom was back quickly. His harp and
flute in their dark leather cases hung on his back with a tied
blanketroll. He carried a plain walking staff as tall as he was.
The two serving women followed on either side. Mat decided they
were sisters. Identical big brown eyes looked up at the gleeman
with identical expressions. Thom was kissing first Saal, then Mada,
and patting cheeks as he headed for the door, jerking his head for
Mat to follow. He was outside before Mat could finish collecting
his own belongings and pick up his quarterstaff.</p>

<p>The younger of the two women, Saal, stopped Mat as he
reached the door. &ldquo;Whatever you said to him, I forgive you for the
wine, even if it is taking him away. I&rsquo;ve not seen him this alive
in weeks.&rdquo; She pressed something into his hand, and when he glanced
at it, his eyes widened in confusion. She had given him a silver
Tar Valon mark. &ldquo;For whatever it was you said. Besides, whoever is
feeding you is not doing a good job of it, but you still have
pretty eyes.&rdquo; She laughed at the expression on his face.</p>

<p>Mat was laughing, too, in spite of himself, as he
went out into the street, rolling the silver coin across the backs
of his fingers. <em>So I have pretty eyes, do I?</em> His laughter
shut off like the last drip from a wine barrel: Thom was there, but
not the corpse. The windows of the taverns down the street put
enough light across the cobblestones for him to be sure of it. The
city guard would not have carried a dead man away without asking
questions, at those taverns and at The Woman of Tanchico, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you staring at, boy?&rdquo; Thom asked. &ldquo;No
Trollocs in those shadows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Footpads,&rdquo; Mat muttered. &ldquo;I was thinking about
footpads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No street thieves or strong-arms in Tar Valon,
either, boy. When the guards take a footpad&mdash;not that many
try that game here; the word spreads&mdash;but when they do, they
haul him to the Tower, and whatever it is the Aes Sedai do to him,
the fellow leaves Tar Valon the next day as wide-eyed as a goosed
girl. I understand they&rsquo;re even harder on women caught thieving.
No, the only way you&rsquo;ll have your money stolen here is somebody
selling you polished brass for gold or using shaved dice. There are
no footpads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat turned on his heel and strode past Thom, heading
toward the docks, quarterstaff thumping off the cobblestones as if
he could push himself ahead faster. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be on the first
ship sailing, whatever it is. The first, Thom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom&rsquo;s stick clicked hurriedly after him. &ldquo;Slow down,
boy. What&rsquo;s your hurry? There are plenty of ships, sailing day and
night. Slow down. There aren&rsquo;t any footpads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first bloody ship, Thom! If it&rsquo;s sinking, we&rsquo;ll
be on it!&rdquo; <em>If they weren&rsquo;t footpads, what were they? They had
to be thieves. What else could they be?</em></p>
