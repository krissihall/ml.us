<h4><em>A Storm in Tear</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">E</span>gwene
finally returned to the table and her tea. She
thought perhaps Elayne was right, that she had gone too far, but
she could not bring herself to apologize, and they sat in
silence.</p>

<p>When Ailhuin returned, she had a man with her, a lean
fellow in his middle years who looked as if he had been carved from
aged wood. Juilin Sandar took off his clogs by the door and hung
his flat, conical straw hat on a peg. A sword-breaker, much like
Hurin&rsquo;s but with short slots to either side of the long one, hung
from a belt over his brown coat, and he carried a staff exactly as
tall as he was, but not much thicker than his thumb and made of
that pale wood, like ridged joints, that the ox-drivers used for
their goads. His short-cut black hair lay flat on his head, and his
quick, dark eyes seemed to note and record every detail of the
room. And of everyone in it. Egwene would have bet he examined
Nynaeve twice, and to her, at least, Nynaeve&rsquo;s lack of reaction was
blatant; it was obvious she knew it, too.</p>

<p>Ailhuin motioned him to a place at the table, where
he turned back the cuffs of his coat sleeves, bowed to each of them
in turn, and sat with his staff propped against his shoulder, not
speaking until the gray-haired woman had made a fresh pot of tea
and everyone had sipped from their cups.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother Guenna has told me of your problem,&rdquo; he said
quietly as he set his cup down. &ldquo;I will help you if I can, but the
High Lords may have their own business to put me to, soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The big woman snorted. &ldquo;Juilin, when did you begin
haggling like a shopkeeper trying to charge silk prices for linen?
Do not claim you know when the High Lords will summon you before
they do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t claim it,&rdquo; Sandar told her with a smile,
&ldquo;but I know when I&rsquo;ve seen men on the rooftops in the night. Just
out of the corner of my eye&mdash;they can hide like pipefish in
reeds&mdash;but I have seen the movement. No one has reported a
theft yet, but there are thieves working inside the walls, and you
can buy your supper with that. Mark me. Before another week, I&rsquo;ll
be summoned to the Stone because a band of thieves is breaking into
merchants&rsquo; houses, or even lords&rsquo; manors. The Defenders may guard
the streets, but when thieves need tracking they send for a
thief-catcher, and me before any other. I am not trying to drive up
my price, but whatever I do for these pretty women, I must do
soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe he speaks the truth,&rdquo; Ailhuin said
reluctantly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll tell you the moon is green and water white if
he thinks it will bring him a kiss, but he lies less than most men
about other things. He may be the most honest man ever born in the
Maule.&rdquo; Elayne put a hand over her mouth, and Egwene struggled not
to laugh. Nynaeve sat unmoved and obviously impatient.</p>

<p>Sandar grimaced at the gray-haired woman, then
apparently decided to ignore what she had said. He smiled at
Nynaeve. &ldquo;I will admit that I&rsquo;m curious about these thieves. I&rsquo;ve
known women thieves, and bands of thieves, but I never heard of a
band of women thieves before. And I owe Mother Guenna favors.&rdquo; His
eyes seemed to record Nynaeve all over again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you charge?&rdquo; she asked sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To recover stolen goods,&rdquo; he said briskly, &ldquo;I ask
the tenth part of the value of what I recover. For finding someone,
I ask a silver mark for each person. Mother Guenna says the things
stolen have little value except to you, mistress, so I suggest you
take that choice.&rdquo; He smiled again; he had very white teeth. &ldquo;I
would not take money from you at all, except that the brotherhood
would frown on it, but I will take as little as I can. A copper or
two, no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know a thief-taker,&rdquo; Elayne told him. &ldquo;From
Shienar. A very <em>respectful</em> man. He carries a sword as well
as a sword-breaker. Why do you not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sandar looked startled for a moment, and then upset
with himself for being startled. He had not caught her hint, or
else had decided to ignore it. &ldquo;You are not Tairen. I have heard of
Shienar, mistress, tales of Trollocs, and every man a warrior.&rdquo; His
smile said these were tales for children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;True stories,&rdquo; Egwene said. &ldquo;Or true enough. I have
been to Shienar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He blinked at her, and went on. &ldquo;I am not a lord, nor
a wealthy merchant, nor even a soldier. The Defenders do not
trouble foreigners much for carrying swords&mdash;unless they mean
to stay long, of course&mdash;but I would be thrust into a cell
under the Stone. There are laws, mistress.&rdquo; His hand rubbed along
his staff, as if unconsciously. &ldquo;I do as well as may be, without a
sword.&rdquo; He focused his smile on Nynaeve once more. &ldquo;Now, if you
will describe these things&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped as she set her purse on the edge of the
table and counted out thirteen silver marks. Egwene thought she had
chosen the lightest coins; most were Tairen, only one Andoran. The
Amyrlin had given them a great deal of gold, but even that would
not last forever.</p>

<p>Nynaeve looked into the purse thoughtfully before
tightening the strings and putting it back into her pouch. &ldquo;There
are thirteen women for you to find, Master Sandar, with as much
silver again when you do. Find them, and we will recover our
property ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do that myself for less than this,&rdquo; he
protested. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s no need for extra rewards. I charge what I
charge. Have no fear I&rsquo;ll take a bribe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no fear of that,&rdquo; Ailhuin agreed. &ldquo;I said
he is honest. Just do not believe him if he says he loves you.&rdquo;
Sandar glared at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I pay the coin, Master Sandar,&rdquo; Nynaeve said firmly,
&ldquo;so I choose what I am buying. Will you find these women, and no
more?&rdquo; She waited for him to nod, reluctantly, before going on.
&ldquo;They may be together, or not. The first is a Taraboner. She is a
little taller than I, with dark eyes and pale, honey-colored hair
that she wears in many small braids after the Tarabon fashion. Some
men might think her pretty, but she would not consider it a
compliment. She has a mean, sulky mouth. The second is Kandori. She
has long black hair with a white streak above her left ear, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave no names, and Sandar asked for none. Names
were so easily changed. His smile was gone now that the business
was at hand. Thirteen women she described as he listened intently,
and when she was done, Egwene was sure he could have recited them
back word for word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother Guenna may have told you this,&rdquo; Nynaeve
finished, &ldquo;but I will repeat it. These women are more dangerous
than you can believe. Over a dozen have died at their hands
already, that I know of, and I would not be surprised if that was
only a drop of the blood on their hands.&rdquo; Sandar and Ailhuin both
blinked at that. &ldquo;If they discover you are asking after them, you
will die. If they take you, they will make you tell where we are,
and Mother Guenna will probably die with us.&rdquo; The gray-haired woman
looked disbelieving. &ldquo;Believe it!&rdquo; Nynaeve&rsquo;s stare demanded
agreement. &ldquo;Believe it, or I&rsquo;ll take back the silver and find
another with more brains!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I was young,&rdquo; Sandar said, voice serious, &ldquo;a
cutpurse put her knife in my ribs because I thought a pretty young
girl wouldn&rsquo;t be as quick to stab as a man. I do not make that
mistake anymore. I will behave as if these women are all Aes Sedai,
and Black Ajah.&rdquo; Egwene almost choked, and he gave her a rueful
grin as he scooped the coins into his own purse and stuck it behind
his sash. &ldquo;I did not mean to frighten you, mistress. There are no
Aes Sedai in Tear. It may take a few days, unless they are
together. Thirteen women together will be easy to find; apart, they
will be harder. But either way, I will find them. And I will not
frighten them away before you learn where they are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he had donned his straw hat and clogs and
departed by the back door, Elayne said, &ldquo;I hope he is not
overconfident. Ailhuin, I heard what he said but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He does
understand that they are dangerous, does he not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has never been a fool except for a pair of eyes
or a pretty ankle,&rdquo; the gray-haired woman said, &ldquo;and that is a
failing of every man. He is the best thief-catcher in Tear. Have no
worry. He will find these Darkfriends of yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will rain again before morning.&rdquo; Nynaeve
shivered, despite the warmth of the room. &ldquo;I feel a storm
gathering.&rdquo; Ailhuin only shook her head and set about filling bowls
with fish soup for supper.</p>

<p>After they ate and cleaned up, Nynaeve and Ailhuin
sat at the table talking of herbs and cures. Elayne worked on a
small patch of embroidery she had begun on the shoulder of her
cloak, tiny blue and white flowers, then read in a copy of <em>The
Essays of Willim of Manaches</em> that Ailhuin had on her small
shelf of books. Egwene tried reading, but neither the essays, nor
<em>The Travels of Jain Farstrider</em>, nor the humorous tales of
Aleria Elffin could hold her interest for more than a few pages.
She fingered the stone <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> through the bosom of
her dress. <em>Where are they? What do they want in the Heart? None
but the Dragon</em>&mdash;<em>none but Rand</em>&mdash;<em>can
touch</em> Callandor, <em>so what do they want? What?
What?</em></p>

<p>As night deepened, Ailhuin showed them each to a
bedroom on the second floor, but after she had gone to her own,
they gathered in Egwene&rsquo;s by the light of a single lamp. Egwene had
already undressed to her shift; the cord hung &rsquo;round her neck with
the two rings. The striped stone felt far heavier than the gold.
This was what they had done every night since leaving Tar Valon,
with the sole exception of that night with the Aiel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wake me after an hour,&rdquo; she told them.</p>

<p>Elayne frowned. &ldquo;So short, this time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you feel uneasy?&rdquo; Nynaeve said. &ldquo;Perhaps you are
using it too often.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We would still be in Tar Valon scrubbing pots and
hoping to find a Black sister before a Gray Man found us if I had
not,&rdquo; Egwene said sharply. <em>Light, Elayne&rsquo;s right. I am snapping
like a sulky child</em>. She took a deep breath. &ldquo;Perhaps I <em>
am</em> uneasy. Maybe it is because we are so close to the Heart of
the Stone, now. So close to <em>Callandor</em>. So close to the
trap, whatever it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; Elayne said, and Nynaeve said, more
quietly, &ldquo;Be very careful, Egwene. Please.&rdquo; She was tugging her
braid in short jerks.</p>

<p>As Egwene lay down on the low-posted bed, with them
on stools to either side, thunder rolled across the sky. Sleep came
slowly.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">It was the rolling hills again, as always at first,
flowers and butterflies under spring sunshine, soft breezes and
birds singing. She wore green silk, this time, with golden birds
embroidered over her breasts, and green velvet slippers. The <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em> seemed light enough to drift up out of her dress
except for the weight of the Great Serpent ring holding it
down.</p>

<p>By simple trial and error she had learned a little of
the rules of <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>&mdash;even this World of
Dreams, this Unseen World, had its rules, if odd ones; she was sure
she did not know a tenth of them&mdash;and one way to make herself
go where she wanted. Closing her eyes, she emptied her mind as she
would have to embrace <em>saidar</em>. It was not as easy, because
the rosebud kept trying to form, and she kept sensing the True
Source, kept aching to embrace it, but she had to fill the
emptiness with something else. She pictured the Heart of the Stone,
as she had seen it in these dreams, formed it in every detail,
perfect within the void. The huge, polished redstone columns. The
age-worn stones of the floor. The dome, far overhead. The crystal
sword, untouchable, slowly revolving hilt-down in midair. When it
was so real she was sure she could reach out and touch it, she
opened her eyes, and she was there, in the Heart of the Stone. Or
the Heart of the Stone as it existed in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>.</p>

<p>The columns were there, and <em>Callandor</em>. And
around the sparkling sword, almost as dim and insubstantial as
shadows, thirteen women sat cross-legged, staring at <em>
Callandor</em> as it revolved. Honey-haired Liandrin turned her
head, looking straight at Egwene with those big, dark eyes, and her
rosebud mouth smiled.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Gasping, Egwene sat up in bed so fast she almost fell
off the side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; Elayne demanded. &ldquo;What
happened? You look frightened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You only just closed your eyes,&rdquo; Nynaeve said
softly. &ldquo;This is the first time since the very beginning that
you&rsquo;ve come back without us waking you. Something did happen,
didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; She tugged her braid sharply. &ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>How did I get back?</em> Egwene wondered. <em>
Light, I do not even know what I did</em>. She knew she was only
trying to put off what she had to say. Unfastening the cord around
her neck, she held the Great Serpent ring and the larger, twisted
<em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> on her palm. &ldquo;They are waiting for us,&rdquo; she
said finally. There was no need to say who. &ldquo;And I think they know
we are in Tear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Outside, the storm broke over the city.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Rain drumming on the deck over his head, Mat stared
at the stones board on the table between him and Thom, but he could
not really concentrate on the game, even with an Andoran silver
mark riding on the outcome. Thunder crashed, and lightning flashed
in the small windows. Four lamps lit the captain&rsquo;s cabin of the
<em>Swift</em>. <em>Bloody ship may be as sleek as the bird, but
it&rsquo;s still taking too bloody long</em>. The vessel gave a small
jolt, then another; the motion seemed to change. <em>He had better
not run us into the bloody mud! If he is not making the best time
he can wring out of this buttertub, I will stuff that gold down his
throat!</em> Yawning&mdash;he had not slept well since leaving
Caemlyn; he could not stop worrying enough to sleep well&mdash;yawning, he set a white stone on the intersection of two lines; in
three moves, he would capture nearly a fifth of Thom&rsquo;s black
stones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could be a good player, boy,&rdquo; the gleeman said
around his pipe, placing his next stone, &ldquo;if you put your mind to
it.&rdquo; His tabac smelled like leaves and nuts.</p>

<p>Mat reached for another stone from the pile at his
elbow, then blinked and let it lie. In the same three moves, Thom&rsquo;s
stones would surround over a third of his. He had not seen it
coming, and he could see no escape. &ldquo;Do you ever lose a game? Have
you ever lost a game?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom removed his pipe and knuckled his mustaches.
&ldquo;Not in a long while. Morgase used to beat me about half the time.
It is said good commanders of soldiers and good players of the
Great Game are good at stones, as well. She is the one, and I&rsquo;ve no
doubt she could command a battle, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you rather dice some more? Stones take too
much time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like a chance to win more than one toss in nine or
ten,&rdquo; the white-haired man said dryly.</p>

<p>Mat bounded to his feet as the door banged open to
admit Captain Derne. The square-faced man whipped his cloak from
his shoulders, shaking the rain off and muttering curses to
himself. &ldquo;The Light sear my bones, I do not know why I ever let you
hire <em>Swift</em>. You, demanding more flaming speed in the
blackest night or the heaviest rain. More speed. Always more bloody
speed! Could have run on a bloody mudflat a hundred times over by
now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wanted the gold,&rdquo; Mat said harshly. &ldquo;You said
this heap of old boards was fast, Derne. When do we reach
Tear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain smiled a tight smile. &ldquo;We are tying off
to the dock, now. And burn me for a bloody farmer if I carry
anything that can flaming talk ever again! Now, where is the rest
of my gold?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat hurried to one of the small windows and peered
out. In the harsh glare of lightning flashes he could see a wet
stone dock, if not much else. He fished the second purse of gold
from his pocket and tossed it to Derne. <em>Whoever heard of a
riverman who didn&rsquo;t dice!</em> &ldquo;About time,&rdquo; he growled. <em>Light
send I&rsquo;m not too late</em>.</p>

<p>He had stuffed all of his spare clothes and his
blankets into the leather script, and he hung that on one side of
him and the roll of fireworks on the other, from the cord he tied
to it. His cloak covered it all, but gapped a little in the front.
Better he got wet than the fireworks. He could dry out and be as
good as new; a test with a bucket had shown fireworks could not.
<em>I guess Rand&rsquo;s da was right</em>. Mat had always thought the
Village Council would not set them off in the rain because they
made a better show on clear nights.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you about ready to sell those things?&rdquo; Thom
was settling his gleeman&rsquo;s cloak on his shoulders. It covered his
leather-cased harp and flute, but his bundle of clothes and
blankets he slung on his back outside the patch-covered cloak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not until I figure out how they work, Thom. Besides,
think what fun it will be when I set them all off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gleeman shuddered. &ldquo;As long as you don&rsquo;t do it
all at once, boy. As long as you don&rsquo;t throw them in the fireplace
at supper. I&rsquo;d not put it past you, the way you&rsquo;ve been behaving
with them. You&rsquo;re lucky the captain here did not throw us off the
ship two days ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Mat laughed. &ldquo;Not while that purse was
in the offing. Eh, Derne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derne was tossing the purse of gold in his hand. &ldquo;I
have not asked before this, but you&rsquo;ve given me the gold, now, and
you&rsquo;ll not take it back. What is this all about? All this flaming
speed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A wager, Derne.&rdquo; Yawning, Mat picked up his
quarterstaff, ready to go. &ldquo;A wager.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A wager!&rdquo; Derne stared at the heavy purse. The other
just like it was locked in his money chest. &ldquo;There must be a
flaming kingdom riding on it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than that,&rdquo; Mat said.</p>

<p>Rain bucketed down on the deck so hard that he could
not see the gangplank except when lightning crackled above the
city; the roar of the downpour barely let him hear himself think.
He could see lights in windows up a street, though. There would be
inns, up there. The captain had not come on deck to see them
ashore, and none of the crew had stayed out in the rain, either.
Mat and Thom made their way to the stone dock alone.</p>

<p>Mat cursed when his boots sank into the mud of the
street, but there was nothing for it, so he kept on, striding along
as fast as he could with his boots and the butt of his staff
sticking at every step. The air smelled of fish, rank even with the
rain. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find an inn,&rdquo; he said, loudly, so he could be heard,
&ldquo;and then I will go out looking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this weather?&rdquo; Thom shouted back. Rain was
rolling down his face, but he was more interested in keeping his
instruments covered than his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Comar could have left Caemlyn before us. If he had a
good horse instead of the crowbaits we were riding, he could have
set out downriver from Aringill maybe a full day ahead of us, and I
don&rsquo;t know how much of that we caught up with that idiot
Derne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a quick passage,&rdquo; Thom allowed.
&ldquo;<em>Swift</em> deserves its name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be that as it may, Thom, rain or no rain, I have to
find him before he finds Egwene and Nynaeve, and Elayne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A few more hours won&rsquo;t make much difference, boy.
There are hundreds of inns in a city the size of Tear. There may be
hundreds more outside the walls, some of them little places with no
more than a dozen rooms to let, so tiny you could walk right by
them and never know they were there.&rdquo; The gleeman hitched the hood
of his cloak up more, muttering to himself. &ldquo;It will take weeks to
search them all. But it will take Comar the same weeks. We can
spend the night in out of the rain. You can wager whatever coin you
have left that Comar won&rsquo;t be out in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat shook his head. <em>A tiny inn with a dozen
rooms</em>. Before he left Emond&rsquo;s Field, the biggest building he
had ever seen was the Winespring Inn. He doubted if Bran al&rsquo;Vere
had any more than a dozen rooms to let. Egwene had lived with her
parents and her sisters in the rooms at the front of the second
floor. <em>Burn me, sometimes I think we should never any of us
have left Emond&rsquo;s Field</em>. But Rand surely had had to, and
Egwene would probably have died if she had not gone to Tar Valon.
<em>Now she might die because she did go</em>. He did not think he
could settle for the farm again; the cows and the sheep certainly
would not play dice. But Perrin still had a chance to go home. <em>
Go home, Perrin</em>, he found himself thinking. <em>Go home while
you still can</em>. He gave himself a shake. <em>Fool! Why would he
want to?</em> He thought of bed, but pushed it away. <em>Not
yet</em>.</p>

<p>Lightning streaked across the sky, three jagged bolts
together, casting a stark light over a narrow house that seemed to
have bunches of herbs hanging in the windows, and a shop, shut up
tight, but a potter&rsquo;s from the sign with its bowls and plates.
Yawning, he hunched his shoulders against the driving rain and
tried to pull his boots out of the clinging mud more quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I can forget about this part of the city,
Thom,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;All this mud, and that stink of fish. Can you
see Nynaeve or Egwene&mdash;or Elayne!&mdash;choosing to stay
here? Women like things neat and tidy, Thom, and smelling
good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May be, boy,&rdquo; Thom muttered, then coughed. &ldquo;You
would be surprised what women will put up with. But it may be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Holding his cloak to keep the roll of fireworks
covered, Mat lengthened his stride. &ldquo;Come on, Thom. I want to find
Comar or the girls tonight, one or the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom limped after him, coughing now and again.</p>

<p>They strode through the wide gates in the city&mdash;unguarded, in the rain&mdash;and Mat was relieved to feel paving
stones under his feet again. And not more than fifty paces up the
street was an inn, the windows of the common room spilling light
onto the street, music drifting out into the night. Even Thom
covered that last fifty paces through the rain quickly, limp or no
limp.</p>

<p>The White Crescent had a landlord whose girth made
his long blue coat fit snugly below the waist as well as above,
unlike those of most of the men in the low-backed chairs at the
tables. Mat thought the landlord&rsquo;s baggy breeches, tied at the
ankle above low shoes, had to be big enough for two ordinary men to
fit inside, one in each leg. The serving women wore dark,
high-necked dresses and short white aprons. There was a fellow
playing a hammered dulcimer between the two stone fireplaces. Thom
eyed the fellow critically and shook his head.</p>

<p>The rotund innkeeper, Cavan Lopar by name, was more
than glad to give them rooms. He frowned at their muddy boots, but
silver from Mat&rsquo;s pocket&mdash;the gold was running low&mdash;and
Thom&rsquo;s patch-covered cloak smoothed his fat forehead. When Thom
said he would perform for a small fee some nights, Lopar&rsquo;s chins
waggled with pleasure. Of a big man with a white streak in his
beard, he knew nothing, nor of three women meeting the descriptions
Mat gave. Mat left everything but his cloak and his quarterstaff in
his room, barely looking to see that it had a bed&mdash;sleep was
enticing, but he refused to let himself think of it&mdash;then
wolfed down a spicy fish stew and rushed back out into the rain. He
was surprised that Thom came with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you wanted to be in where it&rsquo;s dry,
Thom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gleeman patted the flute case he still had under
his cloak. The rest of his things were up in his room. &ldquo;People talk
to a gleeman, boy. I may learn something you would not. I&rsquo;d not
like to see those girls harmed any more than you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was another inn a hundred paces down the
rain-filled street on the other side, and another two hundred
beyond that, and then more. Mat took them as he came to them,
ducking in long enough for Thom to flourish his cloak and tell a
story, then let someone buy him a cup of wine afterwards while Mat
asked around after a tall man with a white streak in his close-cut
black beard and three women. He won a few coins at dice, but he
learned nothing, and neither did Thom. He was just glad the gleeman
seemed to be taking only a few sips of wine at each inn; Thom had
been close to abstemious on the boat, but Mat had not been certain
he would not dive back into the wine once they reached Tear. By the
time they had visited two dozen common rooms, Mat felt as if his
eyelids had weights. The rain had lessened a bit, but it still fell
steadily in big drops, and as the rain fell off the wind had
freshened. The sky had the dark gray look of coming dawn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boy,&rdquo; Thom muttered, &ldquo;if we don&rsquo;t go back to The
White Crescent, I am going to go to sleep here in the rain.&rdquo; He
stopped to cough. &ldquo;Do you realize you&rsquo;ve marched right past three
inns? Light, I am so tired I can&rsquo;t think. Do you have a scheme of
where to go that you have not told me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat stared blearily up the street at a tall man in a
cloak hurrying around a corner. <em>Light, I</em> am <em>tired.
Rand is five hundred leagues from here, playing at being the bloody
Dragon</em>. &ldquo;What? Three inns?&rdquo; They were standing almost in front
of another, The Golden Cup according to the sign creaking in the
wind. It looked nothing like a dice cup, but he decided to give it
a try anyway. &ldquo;One more, Thom. If we don&rsquo;t find them here, we&rsquo;ll go
back and go to bed.&rdquo; Bed sounded better than a dice game with a
hundred gold marks riding on the toss, but he made himself go
in.</p>

<p>Two steps into the common room Mat saw him. The big
man wore a green coat with blue stripes down puffy sleeves, but it
was Comar, close-cut black beard with a white streak over his chin
and all. He sat in one of the strangely low-backed chairs, at a
table on the far side of the room, rattling a leather dice cup and
smiling at the man across from him. That fellow wore a long coat
and baggy breeches, and he was not smiling. He stared at the coins
on the table as if wishing he had them back in his purse. Another
dice cup sat at Comar&rsquo;s elbow.</p>

<p>Comar upended the leather cup in his hand, and began
laughing almost before the dice stopped spinning. &ldquo;Who is next?&rdquo; he
called loudly, pulling the wager to his side of the table. There
was already a considerable pile of silver in front of him. He
scooped the dice into the cup and rattled them. &ldquo;Surely someone
else wants to try his luck?&rdquo; It seemed that no one did, but he kept
rattling the cup and laughing.</p>

<p>The innkeeper was easy to pick out, though they did
not seem to wear aprons in Tear. His coat was the same shade of
deep blue as that of every other innkeeper Mat had spoken to. A
plump man, though little more than half the size of Lopar and with
half that fellow&rsquo;s number of chins, he was sitting at a table by
himself, polishing a pewter mug furiously and glaring across the
room toward Comar, though not when Comar was looking. Some of the
other men gave the bearded man sidelong frowns, too. But not when
he was looking.</p>

<p>Mat suppressed his first urge, which was to rush over
to Comar, drub him over the head with his quarterstaff, and demand
to know where Egwene and the others were. Something was wrong here.
Comar was the first man he had seen wearing a sword, but the way
the men looked at him was more than fear of a swordsman. Even the
serving woman who brought Comar a fresh cup of wine&mdash;and was
pinched for her trouble&mdash;had a nervous laugh for him.</p>

<p><em>Look at it from every side</em>, Mat thought
wearily. <em>Half the trouble I get into is from not doing that. I
have to think</em>. Tiredness seemed to have stuffed his head with
wool. He motioned to Thom, and they strolled over to the
innkeeper&rsquo;s table, who eyed them suspiciously when they sat down.
&ldquo;Who is the man with the stripe in his beard?&rdquo; Mat asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not from the city, are you?&rdquo; the innkeeper said. &ldquo;He
is a foreigner, too. I&rsquo;ve never seen him before tonight, but I know
what he is. Some outlander who has come here and made his fortune
in trade. A merchant rich enough to wear a sword. That is no reason
for him to treat us like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you have never seen him before,&rdquo; Mat said, &ldquo;how
do you know he is a merchant?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The innkeeper looked at him as if he were stupid.
&ldquo;His coat, man, and his sword. He cannot be a lord or a soldier if
he&rsquo;s from off, so he has to be a rich merchant.&rdquo; He shook his head
for the stupidity of foreigners. &ldquo;They come to our places, to look
down their noses at us, and fondle the girls under our very eyes,
but he has no call to do this. If I go to the Maule, I don&rsquo;t gamble
for some fisherman&rsquo;s coins. If I go to the Tavar, I do not dice
with the farmers come to sell their crops.&rdquo; His polishing gained in
ferocity. &ldquo;Such luck, the man has. It must be how he made his
fortune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wins, does he?&rdquo; Yawning, Mat wondered how he
would do dicing with another man who had luck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes he loses,&rdquo; the innkeeper muttered, &ldquo;when
the stake is a few silver pennies. Sometimes. But let it reach a
silver mark&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;No less than a dozen times tonight, I have seen
him win at Crowns with three crowns and two roses. And half again
as often, at Top, it has been three sixes and two fives. He tosses
nothing but sixes at Threes, and three sixes and a five every throw
at Compass. If he has such luck, I say the Light shine on him, and
well to him, but let him use it with other merchants, as is proper.
How can a man have such luck?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weighted dice,&rdquo; Thom said, then coughed. &ldquo;When he
wants to be sure of winning, he uses dice that always show the same
face. He is smart enough not to have made it the highest toss&mdash;folk become suspicious if you always throw the king&rdquo;&mdash;he raised an eyebrow at Mat&mdash;&ldquo;just one that&rsquo;s all but
impossible to beat, but he cannot change that they always show the
same face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard of such,&rdquo; the innkeeper said slowly.
&ldquo;Illianers use them, I hear.&rdquo; Then he shook his head. &ldquo;But both men
use the same cup and dice. It cannot be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring me two dice cups,&rdquo; Thom said, &ldquo;and two sets of
dice. Crowns or spots, it makes no difference, so long as they are
the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The innkeeper frowned at him, but left&mdash;prudently
taking the pewter cup with him&mdash;and came back with two
leather cups. Thom rolled the five bone cubes from one onto the
table in front of Mat. Whether with spots or symbols, every set of
dice Mat had ever seen had been either bone or wood. These had
spots. He picked them up, frowning at Thom. &ldquo;Am I supposed to see
something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom dumped the dice from the other cup into his
hand, then, almost too quickly to follow, dropped them back in and
twisted the cup over to rest upside down on the table before the
dice could fall out. He kept his hand on top of the cup. &ldquo;Put a
mark on each of them, boy. Something small, but something you&rsquo;ll
know for your mark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat found himself exchanging puzzled glances with the
innkeeper. Then they both looked at the cup upside down under
Thom&rsquo;s hand. He knew Thom was up to something tricky&mdash;gleemen
were always doing things that were impossible, like eating fire and
pulling silk out of the air&mdash;but he did not see how Thom
could do anything with him watching close. He unsheathed his belt
knife and made a small scratch on each die, right across the circle
of six spots.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, setting them back on the table.
&ldquo;Show me your trick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom reached over and picked up the dice, then set
them down again a foot away. &ldquo;Look for your marks, boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat frowned. Thom&rsquo;s hand was still on the upended
leather cup; the gleeman had not moved it or taken Mat&rsquo;s dice
anywhere near it. He picked up the dice&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and blinked. There
was not a scratch on them. The innkeeper gasped.</p>

<p>Thom turned his free hand over, revealing five dice.
&ldquo;Your marks are on these. That is what Comar is doing. It is a
child&rsquo;s trick, simple, though I&rsquo;d never have thought he had the
fingers for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think I want to play dice with you after
all,&rdquo; Mat said slowly. The innkeeper was staring at the dice, but
not as if he saw any solution. &ldquo;Call the Watch, or whatever you
call it here,&rdquo; Mat told him. &ldquo;Have him arrested.&rdquo; <em>He&rsquo;ll kill
nobody in a prison cell. Yet what if they are already dead?</em> He
tried not to listen, but the thought persisted. <em>Then I&rsquo;ll see
him dead, and Gaebril, whatever it takes! But they aren&rsquo;t, burn me!
They can&rsquo;t be!</em></p>

<p>The innkeeper was shaking his head. &ldquo;Me? Me, denounce
a merchant to the Defenders? They would not even look at his dice.
He could say one word, and I would be in chains working the
channel dredges in the Fingers of the Dragon. He could cut me down
where I stood, and the Defenders would say I had earned it. Perhaps
he will go away after a while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat gave him a wry grimace. &ldquo;If I expose him, will
that be good enough? Will you call the Watch, or the Defenders or
whoever, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not understand. You are a foreigner. Even if
he is from off, he is a wealthy man, important.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait here,&rdquo; Mat told Thom. &ldquo;I do not mean to let him
reach Egwene and the others, whatever it takes.&rdquo; He yawned as he
scraped back his chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, boy,&rdquo; Thom called after him, soft yet urgent.
The gleeman pushed himself up out of his chair. &ldquo;Burn you, you
don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re putting your foot into!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat waved for him to stay there and walked over to
Comar. No one else had taken up the bearded man&rsquo;s challenge, and he
eyed Mat with interest as Mat leaned his quarterstaff against the
table and sat down.</p>

<p>Comar studied Mat&rsquo;s coat and grinned nastily. &ldquo;You
want to wager coppers, farmer? I do not waste my time with&mdash;&rdquo;
He cut off as Mat set an Andoran gold crown on the table and yawned
at him, making no effort to cover his mouth. &ldquo;You say little,
farmer, though your manners could use improving, but gold has a
voice of its own and no need of manners.&rdquo; He shook the leather cup
in his hand and spilled the dice out. He was chuckling before they
came to rest, showing three crowns and two roses. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not beat
that, farmer. Perhaps you have more gold hidden in those rags that
you want to lose? What did you do? Rob your master?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He reached for the dice, but Mat scooped them up
ahead of him. Comar glared, but let him have the cup. If both
tosses were the same, they would throw again until one man won. Mat
smiled as he rattled the dice. He did not mean to give Comar a
chance to change them. If they threw the same toss three or four
times in a row&mdash;exactly the same, every time&mdash;even
these Defenders would listen. The whole common room would see; they
would have to back his word.</p>

<p>He spilled the dice onto the tabletop. They bounced
oddly. He felt something&mdash;shifting. It was as if his luck had
gone wild. The room seemed to be writhing around him, tugging at
the dice with threads. For some reason he wanted to look at the
door, but he kept his eyes on the dice. They came to rest. Five
crowns. Comar&rsquo;s eyes looked ready to pop out of his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You lose,&rdquo; Mat said softly. If his luck was in to
this extent, perhaps it was time to push it. A voice in the back of
his head told him to think, but he was too tired to listen. &ldquo;I
think your luck is about used up, Comar. If you&rsquo;ve harmed those
girls, it&rsquo;s all gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not even found&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Comar began, still
staring at the dice, then jerked his head up. His face had gone
white. &ldquo;How do you know my name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had not found them, yet. <em>Luck, sweet luck,
stay with me</em>. &ldquo;Go back to Caemlyn, Comar. Tell Gaebril you
could not find them. Tell him they are dead. Tell him anything, but
leave Tear tonight. If I see you again, I&rsquo;ll kill you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; the big man said unsteadily. &ldquo;Who&mdash;?&rdquo;
The next instant his sword was out and he was on his feet.</p>

<p>Mat shoved the table at him, overturning it, and
grabbed for his quarterstaff. He had forgotten how big Comar was.
The bearded man pushed the table right back at him. Mat fell over
with his chair, holding a bare grasp on his staff, as Comar heaved
the table out of the way and stabbed at him. Mat threw his feet
against the man&rsquo;s middle to stop his rush, swung the staff
awkwardly, just enough to deflect the sword. But the blow knocked
the staff from his fingers, and he found himself gripping Comar&rsquo;s
wrist, instead, with the man&rsquo;s blade a hand from his face. With a
grunt he rolled backwards, heaving as hard as he could with his
legs. Comar&rsquo;s eyes widened as he sailed over Mat to crash onto a
table, face up. Mat scrambled for his staff, but when he had it,
Comar had not moved.</p>

<p>The big man lay with his hips and legs sprawled
across the top of the table, the rest of him hanging down with his
head on the floor. The men who had been sitting at the table were
on their feet a safe distance away, wringing their hands and eyeing
each other nervously. A low, worried buzz filled the common room,
not the noise Mat expected.</p>

<p>Comar&rsquo;s sword lay within easy reach of his hand. But
he did not move. He stared at Mat, though, as Mat kicked the sword
away and went to one knee beside him. <em>Light! I think his back
is broken!</em> &ldquo;I told you you should have gone, Comar. Your luck
is all used up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fool,&rdquo; the big man breathed. &ldquo;Do you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;think I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;was the only&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;one hunting them? They won&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;live till&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; His eyes stared at Mat, and his mouth was open, but he said
no more. Nor ever would again.</p>

<p>Mat met the glazing stare, trying to will more words
out of the dead man. <em>Who else, burn you? Who? Where are they?
My luck. Burn me, what happened to my luck?</em> He became aware of
the innkeeper pulling frantically at his arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must go. You must. Before the Defenders come. I
will show them the dice. I will tell them it was an outlander, but
a tall man. With red-colored hair, and gray eyes. No one will
suffer. A man I dreamed of last night. No one real. No one will
contradict me. He took coin from everyone with his dice. But you
must go. You must!&rdquo; Everyone else in the room was studiously
looking another way.</p>

<p>Mat let himself be hauled away from the dead man and
pushed outside. Thom was already waiting in the rain. He seized
Mat&rsquo;s arm and limped down the street hurriedly, pulling Mat
stumbling behind him. Mat&rsquo;s hood hung down his back; the rain
soaked his hair and poured down his face, down his neck, but he did
not notice. The gleeman kept looking over his shoulder, searching
the street beyond Mat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you asleep, boy? You did not look asleep back
there. Come on, boy. The Defenders will arrest any outlander within
two streets, no matter what description that innkeeper gives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the luck,&rdquo; Mat mumbled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve figured it out.
The dice. My luck works best when things are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;random. Like
dice. Not much good for cards. No good at stones. Too much pattern.
It has to be random. Even finding Comar. I&rsquo;d stopped visiting every
inn. I walked into that one by chance. Thom, if I am going to find
Egwene and the others in time, I have to look without any
pattern.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about? The man is dead. If he
already killed them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Well, you&rsquo;ve avenged them. If he hasn&rsquo;t,
you saved them. Now will you bloody walk faster? The Defenders
won&rsquo;t be long coming, and they are not so gentle as the Queen&rsquo;s
Guards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat shook his arm free and picked up his pace
unsteadily, dragging the quarterstaff. &ldquo;He let it slip that he
hadn&rsquo;t located them, yet. But he said he was not the only one.
Thom, I believe him. I was looking him in the eye, and he was
telling the truth. I still have to find them, Thom. And now I don&rsquo;t
even know who is after them. I have to find them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stifling a huge yawn with his fist, Thom pulled Mat&rsquo;s
hood up against the rain. &ldquo;Not tonight, boy. I need sleep, and so
do you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Wet. My hair&rsquo;s dripping in my face</em>. His head
seemed fuzzy. With a need for sleep, he realized after a moment.
And he realized how tired he was, if he had to think just to know
it. &ldquo;All right, Thom. But I am going to look again as soon as it&rsquo;s
light.&rdquo; Thom nodded and coughed, and they made their way back to
The White Crescent through the rain.</p>

<p>Dawn was not long in coming, but Mat rousted himself
out of bed, and he and Thom set off trying to search every inn
inside the walls of Tear. Mat let himself wander wherever the mood
and the next turning took him, not looking for inns at all, and
tossing a coin to decide whether to go in. For three days and
nights he did this, and for three days and nights it rained without
stopping, sometimes thundering, sometimes quiet, but always pouring
down.</p>

<p>Thom&rsquo;s cough grew worse, so he had to stop playing
the flute and telling stories, and he would not carry his harp out
in that weather; he insisted on going along, however, and men still
talked to a gleeman. Mat&rsquo;s luck with the dice seemed even better
since he had begun this random wander, though he never stayed in
one inn or tavern long enough to win more than a few coins. Neither
of them heard anything useful. Rumors of war with Illian. Rumors of
invading Mayene. Rumors of invasion from Andor, of the Sea Folk
shutting off trade, of Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s armies returning from the
dead. Rumors the Dragon was coming. The men Mat gambled with were
as gloomy about one rumor as the next; they seemed to him to hunt
for the darkest rumors they could find and half believe them all.
But he heard not a whisper that might lead him to Egwene and the
others. Not one innkeeper had seen women matching their
descriptions.</p>

<p>He began to have bad dreams, no doubt from all his
worrying. Egwene and Nynaeve and Elayne, and some fellow with
close-cropped white hair, wearing a coat with puffy, striped
sleeves like Comar&rsquo;s, laughing and weaving a net around them. Only
sometimes it was Moiraine he was weaving the net for, and sometimes
he held a crystal sword instead, a sword that blazed like the sun
as soon as he touched it. Sometimes it was Rand who held the sword.
For some reason, he dreamed of Rand a good deal.</p>

<p>Mat was sure it was all because he was not getting
enough sleep, not eating except when he happened to remember, but
he would not stop. He had a wager to win, he told himself, and he
meant to win this one if it killed him.</p>
