<h4><em>Caemlyn</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">M</span>at
had vague memories of Caemlyn, but when they
approached it in the early hours after sunrise, it seemed as if he
had never been there before. They had not been alone on the road
since first light, and other riders surrounded them now, and trains
of merchants&rsquo; wagons and folk afoot, all streaming toward the great
city.</p>

<p>Built on rising hills, it was surely as large as Tar
Valon, and outside the huge walls&mdash;a fifty-foot height of
pale, grayish stone streaked with white and silver sparkling in the
sun, spaced with tall, round towers with the Lion Banner of Andor
waving atop them, white on red&mdash;outside those walls, it
seemed as if another great city had been placed, wrapping around
the walled city, all red brick and gray stone and white plastered
walls, inns pushed in on houses of three and four stories so fine
they must belong to wealthy merchants, shops with goods displayed
on tables under awnings crowding against wide, windowless
warehouses. Open markets under red and purple roof tiles lined the
road on both sides, men and women already crying their wares,
bargaining at the top of their voices, while penned calves and
sheep and goats and pigs, caged geese and chickens and ducks, added
to the din. He seemed to remember thinking Caemlyn was too noisy
when he was here before; now it sounded like a heartbeat, pumping
wealth.</p>

<p>The road led to arched gates twenty feet high,
standing open under the watchful eye of red-coated Queen&rsquo;s Guards
in their shining breast-plates&mdash;they eyed Thom and him no
more than anyone else, not even the quarterstaff slanted across his
saddle in front of him; all they cared was that people keep moving,
it seemed&mdash;and then they were within. Slender towers here
rose even taller than those along the walls, and gleaming domes
shone white and gold above streets teeming with people. Just inside
the gates the road split into two parallel streets, separated by a
wide strip of grass and trees. The hills of the city rose like
steps toward a peak, which was surrounded by another wall, shining
as white as Tar Valon&rsquo;s, with still more domes and towers within.
That was the Inner City, Mat recalled, and atop those highest hills
stood the Royal Palace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No point waiting,&rdquo; he told Thom. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the
letter straight on.&rdquo; He looked at the sedan chairs and carriages
making their way through the crowds, the shops with all their goods
displayed. &ldquo;A man could earn some gold in this city, Thom, once he
found a game of dice, or cards.&rdquo; He was not quite so lucky at cards
as at dice, but few except nobles and the wealthy played those
games anyway. <em>Now that&rsquo;s who I should find a game
with</em>.</p>

<p>Thom yawned at him and hitched at his gleeman&rsquo;s cloak
as if it were a blanket. &ldquo;We have ridden all night, boy. Let&rsquo;s at
least find something to eat, first. The Queen&rsquo;s Blessing has good
meals.&rdquo; He yawned again. &ldquo;And good beds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember that,&rdquo; Mat said slowly. He did, in a way.
The innkeeper was a fat man with graying hair, Master Gill.
Moiraine had caught up to Rand and him there, when he had thought
they were finally free of her. <em>She&rsquo;s off playing her game with
Rand, now. Nothing to do with me. Not anymore</em>. &ldquo;I will meet
you there, Thom. I said I&rsquo;d have this letter out of my hands an
hour after I arrived, and I mean to. You go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom nodded and turned his horse aside, calling over
his shoulder through a yawn. &ldquo;Do not become lost, boy. It&rsquo;s a big
city, Caemlyn.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>And a rich one</em>. Mat heeled his mount on up
the crowded street. <em>Lost! I can find my bloody way</em>. The
sickness appeared to have erased parts of his memory. He could look
at an inn, its upper floors sticking out over the ground floor all
the way around and its sign creaking in the breeze, and remember
seeing it before, yet not recall another thing he could see from
that spot. A hundred paces of street might abruptly spark in his
memory, while the parts before and after remained as mysterious as
dice still in the cup.</p>

<p>Even with the holes in his memory he was sure he had
never been to the Inner City or the Royal Palace&mdash;<em>I
couldn&rsquo;t forget that!</em>&mdash;yet he did not need to remember
the way. The streets of the New City&mdash;he remembered that name
suddenly; it was the part of Caemlyn less than two thousand years
old&mdash;ran every which way, but the main boulevards all led to
the Inner City. The Guards at the gates made no effort to stop
anyone.</p>

<p>Within those white walls were buildings that could
almost have fit in Tar Valon. The curving streets topped hills to
reveal thin towers, their tiled walls sparkling with a hundred
colors in the sunlight, or to look down on parks laid out in
patterns made to be viewed from above, or to show sweeping vistas
across the entire city to the rolling plains and forests beyond. It
did not really matter which streets he took here. They all spiraled
in on what he sought, the Royal Palace of Andor.</p>

<p>In no time, he found himself crossing the huge oval
plaza before the Palace, riding toward its tall, gilded gates. The
pure white Palace of Andor would certainly not have been out of
place among Tar Valon&rsquo;s wonders, with its slender towers and golden
domes shining in the sun, its high balconies and intricate
stonework. The gold leaf on one of those domes could have kept him
in luxury for a year.</p>

<p>There were fewer people in the plaza than elsewhere,
as if it were reserved for great occasions. A dozen of the Guards
stood before the closed gates, bows slanted, all at exactly the
same angle, across their gleaming breastplates, faces hidden by the
steel bars of their burnished helmets&rsquo; face-guards. A heavyset
officer, with his red cloak thrown back to reveal a knot of gold
braid on his shoulder, was walking up and down the line, eyeing
each man as if he thought he might find rust or dust.</p>

<p>Mat drew rein and put on a smile. &ldquo;Good morning to
you, Captain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The officer turned, staring at him through the bars
of his face-guard with deep, beady eyes, like a pudgy rat in a
cage. The man was older than he had expected&mdash;surely old
enough to have more than one knot of rank&mdash;and fat rather
than stocky. &ldquo;What do you want, farmer?&rdquo; he demanded roughly.</p>

<p>Mat drew a breath. <em>Make it good. Impress this
fool so he doesn&rsquo;t keep me waiting all day. I don&rsquo;t want to have to
flash the Amyrlin&rsquo;s paper around to keep from kicking my
heels</em>. &ldquo;I come from Tar Valon, from the White Tower, bearing a
letter from&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>You</em> come from Tar Valon, farmer?&rdquo; The fat
officer&rsquo;s stomach shook as he laughed, but then his laughter cut
off as if severed with a knife, and he glared. &ldquo;We want no letters
from Tar Valon, rogue, if you have such a thing! Our good Queen&mdash;may the Light illumine her!&mdash;will take no word from
the White Tower until the Daughter-Heir is returned to her. I never
heard of any messenger from the Tower wearing a country man&rsquo;s coat
and breeches. It is plain to me you are up to some trick, perhaps
thinking you&rsquo;ll find a few coins if you come claiming to carry
letters, but you will be lucky if you don&rsquo;t end in a prison cell!
If you do come from Tar Valon, go back and tell the Tower to return
the Daughter-Heir before we come and take her! If you&rsquo;re a
trickster after silver, get out of my sight before I have you
beaten within an inch of your life! Either way, you half-wit looby,
be gone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat had been trying to edge a word in from the
beginning of the man&rsquo;s speech. He said quickly, &ldquo;The letter is from
her, man. It is from&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I not tell you to be gone, ruffian?&rdquo; the fat man
bellowed. His face was growing nearly as red as his coat. &ldquo;Take
yourself out of my sight, you gutter scum! If you are not gone by
the time I count ten, I will arrest you for littering the plaza
with your presence! One! Two!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you count so high, you fat fool?&rdquo; Mat snapped.
&ldquo;I tell you, Elayne sent&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guards!&rdquo; The officer&rsquo;s face was purple now. &ldquo;Seize
this man for a Darkfriend!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat hesitated a moment, sure no one could take such a
charge seriously, but the red-coated Guards dashed toward him, all
dozen men in breast-plates and helmets, and he wheeled his horse
and galloped ahead of them, followed by the fat man&rsquo;s shouts. The
gelding was no racer, but it out-distanced men afoot easily enough.
People dodged out of his way along the curving streets, shaking
fists after him and shouting as many curses as the officer had.</p>

<p><em>Fool</em>, he thought, meaning the fat officer,
then added another for himself. <em>All I had to do was say her
bloody name in the beginning. &ldquo;Elayne, the Daughter-Heir of Andor,
sends this letter to her mother, Queen Morgase.&rdquo; Light, who could
have thought they&rsquo;d think that way about Tar Valon</em>. From what
he remembered of his last visit, Aes Sedai and the White Tower had
been close behind Queen Morgase in the Guards&rsquo; affections. <em>Burn
her, Elayne could have told me</em>. Reluctantly, he added, <em>I
could have asked questions, too</em>.</p>

<p>Before he reached the arched gates that let out into
the New City, he slowed to a walk. He did not think the Guards from
the Palace could still be chasing him, and there was no point in
attracting the eyes of those at the gate by galloping through, but
they looked at him no more now than when he had first entered.</p>

<p>As he rode under the broad arch, he smiled and almost
turned back. He had suddenly remembered something, and had an idea
that appealed to him a good deal more than walking through the
Palace gates. Even if that fat officer had not been watching the
gates, he thought he would like it better.</p>

<p>He became lost twice while searching for The Queen&rsquo;s
Blessing, but at last he found the sign with a man kneeling before
a woman with red-gold hair and a crown of golden roses, her hand on
his head. It was a broad stone building of three stories, with tall
windows even up under the red roof tiles. He rode around back to
the stableyard, where a horse-faced fellow, in a leather vest that
could hardly be any tougher than his skin, took his horse&rsquo;s reins.
He thought he remembered the fellow. <em>Yes. Ramey</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has been a long time, Ramey.&rdquo; Mat tossed him a
silver mark. &ldquo;You remember me, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say as I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Ramey began, then caught the
shine of silver where he had expected copper; he coughed, and his
short nod turned into something that combined a knuckled forehead
with a jerky bow. &ldquo;Why, of course I do, young master. Forgive me.
Slipped my mind. Mind no good for people. Good for horses. I know
horses, I do. A fine animal, young master. I&rsquo;ll take good care of
him, you can be sure.&rdquo; He delivered it all quickly, with no room
for Mat to say a word, then hurried the gelding into the stable
before he might have to come up with Mat&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p>With a sour grimace, Mat put the fat roll of
fireworks under his arm and shouldered the rest of his belongings.
<em>Fellow couldn&rsquo;t tell me from Hawkwing&rsquo;s toenails</em>. A bulky,
muscular man was sitting on an upturned barrel beside the door to
the kitchen, gently scratching the ear of a black-and-white cat
crouched on his knee. The man studied Mat with heavy-lidded eyes,
especially the quarterstaff across his shoulder, but he never
stopped his scratching. Mat thought he remembered him, but he could
not bring up a name. He said nothing as he went through the door,
and neither did the man. <em>No reason they should remember me.
Probably have bloody Aes Sedai coming for people every
day</em>.</p>

<p>In the kitchen, two undercooks and three scullions
were darting between stoves and roasting spits under the direction
of a round woman with her hair in a bun and a long wooden spoon
that she used to point out what she wanted done. Mat was sure he
remembered the round woman. <em>Coline, and what a name for a woman
that wide, but everybody called her Cook</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Cook,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;I am back, and not a
year since I left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She peered at him a moment, then nodded. &ldquo;I remember
you.&rdquo; He began to grin. &ldquo;You were with that young prince, weren&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;The one who looked so like Tigraine, the Light
illumine her memory. You&rsquo;re his serving man, aren&rsquo;t you? Is he
coming back, then, the young prince?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said curtly. <em>A prince! Light!</em> &ldquo;I do
not think he will be anytime soon, and I don&rsquo;t think you would like
it if he did.&rdquo; She protested, saying what a fine, handsome young
man the prince was&mdash;<em>Burn me, it there a woman anywhere
who doesn&rsquo;t moon over Rand and make calf-eyes if you mention his
bloody name? She&rsquo;d bloody scream if she knew what he is doing
now</em>&mdash;but he refused to let her get it out. &ldquo;Is Master
Gill about? And Thom Merrilin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the library,&rdquo; she said with a tight sniff. &ldquo;You
tell Basel Gill when you see him that I said those drains need
cleaning. Today, mind.&rdquo; She caught sight of something one of the
undercooks was doing to a beef roast and waddled over to her. &ldquo;Not
so much, child. You will make the meat too sweet if you put so much
arrath on it.&rdquo; She seemed to have forgotten Mat already.</p>

<p>He shook his head as he went in search of this
library he could not remember. He could not remember that Coline
was married to Master Gill, either, but if he had ever heard a
goodwife send instructions to her husband, that had been it. A
pretty serving girl with big eyes giggled and directed him down a
hall beside the common room.</p>

<p>When he stepped into the library, he stopped and
stared. There had to be more than three hundred books on the
shelves built on the walls, and more lying on tables; he had never
seen so many books in one place in his life. He noticed a
leather-bound copy of <em>The Travels of Jain Farstrider</em> on a
small table near the door. He had always meant to read that&mdash;Rand and Perrin had always been telling him things out of it&mdash;but he never did seem to get around to reading the books he meant
to read.</p>

<p>Pink-faced Basel Gill and Thom Merrilin were seated
at one of the tables, facing each other across a stones board,
pipes in their teeth trailing thin blue streamers of tabac smoke. A
calico cat sat on the table beside a wooden dice cup, her tail
curled over her feet, watching them play. The gleeman&rsquo;s cloak was
nowhere in sight, so Mat supposed he had already gotten a room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re done sooner than I expected, boy,&rdquo; Thom said
around his pipestem. He tugged one long, white mustache as he
considered where to place his next stone on the board&rsquo;s
cross-hatchings. &ldquo;Basel, you remember Mat Cauthon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; the fat innkeeper said, peering at the
board. &ldquo;Sickly, the last time you were here, I recall. I hope you
are better now, lad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am better,&rdquo; Mat said. &ldquo;Is that all you remember?
That I was sick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master Gill winced at Thom&rsquo;s move and took his pipe
out of his mouth. &ldquo;Considering who you left with, lad, and
considering the way things are now, maybe it&rsquo;s best I remember no
more than that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aes Sedai not in such good odor now, are they?&rdquo; Mat
set his things in one big armchair, the quarterstaff propped
against the back, and himself in another with one leg swinging over
the arm. &ldquo;The Guards at the Palace seemed to think the White Tower
had stolen Elayne.&rdquo; Thom eyed the roll of fireworks uneasily,
looked at his smoking pipe, and muttered to himself before going
back to his study of the board.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hardly that,&rdquo; Gill said, &ldquo;but the whole city knows
she disappeared from the Tower. Thom says she&rsquo;s returned, but we&rsquo;ve
heard none of that here. Perhaps Morgase knows, but everyone down
to a stableboy is stepping lightly so she doesn&rsquo;t snap off his
head. Lord Gaebril has kept her from actually sending anyone to the
headsman, but I&rsquo;d not say she would not do it. And he has certainly
not soothed her temper toward Tar Valon. If anything, I think he
has made it worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Morgase has a new advisor,&rdquo; Thom said in a dry
voice. &ldquo;Gareth Bryne did not like him, so Bryne has been retired to
his estate to watch his sheep grow wool. Basel, are you going to
place a stone or not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a moment, Thom. In a moment. I want to set it
right.&rdquo; Gill clamped his teeth around his pipestem and frowned at
the board, puffing up smoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So the Queen has an advisor who doesn&rsquo;t like Tar
Valon,&rdquo; Mat said. &ldquo;Well, that explains the way the Guards acted
when I said I came from there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you told them that,&rdquo; Gill said, &ldquo;you might be
lucky you escaped without any broken bones. If it was any of the
new men, at least. Gaebril has replaced half the Guards in Caemlyn
with men of his choosing, and that is no mean feat considering how
short a time he has been here. Some say Morgase may marry him.&rdquo; He
started to put a stone on the board, then took it back with a shake
of his head. &ldquo;Times change. People change. Too much change for me.
I suppose I am growing old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem to mean us both to grow old before you
place a stone,&rdquo; Thom muttered. The cat stretched and slinked across
the table for him to stroke her back. &ldquo;Talking all day will not let
you find a good move. Why don&rsquo;t you just admit defeat, Basel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never admit defeat,&rdquo; Gill said stoutly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll beat
you yet, Thom.&rdquo; He set a white stone on the intersection of two
lines. &ldquo;You will see.&rdquo; Thom snorted.</p>

<p>From what Mat could see of the board, he did not
think Gill had much chance. &ldquo;I will just have to avoid the Guards
and put Elayne&rsquo;s letter right into Morgase&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo; <em>Especially
if they&rsquo;re all like that fat fool. Light, I wonder if he&rsquo;s told
them all I&rsquo;m a Darkfriend?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not deliver it?&rdquo; Thom barked. &ldquo;I thought you
were anxious to be rid of the thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a letter from the Daughter-Heir?&rdquo; Gill
exclaimed. &ldquo;Thom, why did you not tell me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry, Basel,&rdquo; the gleeman muttered. He glared
at Mat from under those bushy eyebrows and blew out his mustaches.
&ldquo;The boy thinks someone is out to kill him over it, so I thought
I&rsquo;d let him say what he wanted and no more. Seems he does not care
any longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of letter?&rdquo; Gill asked. &ldquo;Is she coming
home? And Lord Gawyn? I hope they are. I&rsquo;ve actually heard talk of
war with Tar Valon, as if anyone could be fool enough to go to war
with Aes Sedai. If you ask me, it is all one with those mad rumors
we&rsquo;ve heard about Aes Sedai supporting a false Dragon somewhere in
the, west, and using the Power as a weapon. Not that I can see why
that would make anyone want to go to war with them; just the
opposite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you married to Coline?&rdquo; Mat asked, and Master
Gill gave a start.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light preserve me from that! You would think the
inn was hers now. If she was my wife&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;! What does that have to
do with the Daughter-Heir&rsquo;s letter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Mat said, &ldquo;but you went on so long, I
thought you must have forgotten your own questions.&rdquo; Gill made a
choking sound, and Thom barked a laugh. Mat hurried on before the
innkeeper could speak. &ldquo;The letter is sealed; Elayne did not tell
me what it says.&rdquo; Thom was eyeing him sideways and stroking his
mustaches. <em>Does he think I&rsquo;ll admit we opened the thing?</em>
&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think she is coming home. She means to be Aes Sedai,
if you ask me.&rdquo; He told them about his attempt to deliver the
letter, smoothing over a few edges they had no need to know about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The new men,&rdquo; Gill said. &ldquo;That officer sounds it, at
least. I&rsquo;ll wager on it. No better than brigands, most of them,
except the ones with a sly eye. You wait until this afternoon, lad,
when the Guards on the gate will have changed. Say the
Daughter-Heir&rsquo;s name right out, and just in case the new fellow is
one of Gaebril&rsquo;s men, too, duck your head a little. A knuckle to
your forehead, and you&rsquo;ll have no trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn me if I will. I pull wool and scratch gravel
for nobody. Not to Morgase herself. This time, I&rsquo;ll not go near the
Guards at all.&rdquo; <em>I would just as soon not know what word that
fat fellow has spread</em>. They stared at him as if he were
mad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How under the Light,&rdquo; Gill said, &ldquo;do you mean to
enter the Royal Palace without passing the Guards?&rdquo; His eyes
widened as if he were remembering something. &ldquo;Light, you don&rsquo;t mean
to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Lad, you&rsquo;d need the Dark One&rsquo;s own luck to escape with
your life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going on about now, Basel? Mat, what
fool thing do you intend to try?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am lucky, Master Gill,&rdquo; Mat said. &ldquo;You just have a
good meal waiting when I come back.&rdquo; As he stood, he picked up the
dice cup and spun the dice out beside the stones board for luck.
The calico cat leaped down, hissing at him with her back arched.
The five spotted dice came to rest, each showing a single pip. <em>
The Dark One&rsquo;s Eyes</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the best toss or the worst,&rdquo; Gill said. &ldquo;It
depends on the game you are playing, doesn&rsquo;t it. Lad, I think you
mean to play a dangerous game. Why don&rsquo;t you take that cup out into
the common room and lose a few coppers? You look to me like a
fellow who might like a little gamble. I will see the letter gets
to the Palace safely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coline wants you to clean the drains,&rdquo; Mat told him,
and turned to Thom while the innkeeper was still blinking and
muttering to himself. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem to make any odds whether I
get an arrow in me trying to deliver that letter or a knife in my
back waiting. It&rsquo;s six up, and a half dozen down. Just you have
that meal waiting, Thom.&rdquo; He tossed a gold mark on the table in
front of Gill. &ldquo;Have my things put in a room, innkeeper. If it
takes more coin, you will have it. Be careful of the big roll; it
frightens Thom something awful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he stalked out, he heard Gill say to Thom, &ldquo;I
always thought that lad was a rascal. How does he come by
gold?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>I always win, that&rsquo;s how</em>, he thought grimly.
<em>I just have to win once more, and I&rsquo;m done with Elayne, and
that&rsquo;s the last of the White Tower for me. Just once more</em>.</p>
