climbed off the bed and started dressing, not
caring whether Zarine was watching or not. He knew what he intended
to do, but he asked Moiraine anyway. &ldquo;Do we leave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unless you want to make closer acquaintance with
Sammael,&rdquo; she said dryly. Thunder crashed overhead as if to
punctuate her sentence, and lightning flashed. The Aes Sedai barely
glanced at Zarine.</p>

<p>Stuffing his shirttail into his breeches, he suddenly
wished he had his coat and cloak on. Naming which one of the
Forsaken it was made the room seem cold. <em>Ba&rsquo;alzamon isn&rsquo;t bad
enough; we have to have the Forsaken loose, too. Light, does it
even matter if we find Rand, now? Is it too late?</em> But he kept
dressing, stamping his feet into his boots. It was that or give up,
and Two Rivers folk were not known for giving up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sammael?&rdquo; Zarine said faintly. &ldquo;One of the Forsaken
rules&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Light!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you still wish to follow?&rdquo; Moiraine said softly.
&ldquo;I would not make you stay here, not now, but I will give you one
last chance to swear to go another way than I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zarine hesitated, and Perrin paused with his coat
half on. Surely no one would choose to go with people who had
incurred the wrath of one of the Forsaken. Not now that she knew
something of what they faced. <em>Not unless she has a very good
reason</em>. For that matter, anyone who heard one of the Forsaken
was loose should already be running for a Sea Folk ship and asking
passage to the other side of the Aiel Waste, not sitting there
thinking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Zarine said finally, and he began to relax.
&ldquo;No, I will not swear to go another way. Whether you lead me to the
Horn of Valere or not, not even whoever does find the Horn will
have a story such as this. I think this story will be told for the
ages, Aes Sedai, and I will be part of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Perrin snapped. &ldquo;That is not good enough. What
do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no time for this bickering,&rdquo; Moiraine broke
in. &ldquo;Any moment <em>Lord Brend</em> may learn that one of his
Darkhounds is dead. You can be sure he will know that means a
Warder, and he will come looking for the Gaidin&rsquo;s Aes Sedai. Do you
mean to sit here until he discovers where you are? Move, you
foolish children! Move!&rdquo; She vanished down the hall before he could
open his mouth.</p>

<p>Zarine did not wait, either, running from the room
without her candle. Perrin hastily gathered his things and dashed
for the back stairs still buckling his axe belt around his waist.
He caught up to Loial going down, the Ogier trying to stuff a
wood-bound book into his saddlebags and put on his cloak at the
same time. Perrin gave him a hand with the cloak while they both
ran down the stairs, and Zarine caught the pair of them before they
could dash out into the pouring rain.</p>

<p>Perrin hunched his shoulders against the wet and ran
for the stable across the storm-darkened yard without waiting to
pull up the hood of his cloak. <em>She has to have a reason. Being
in a bloody story isn&rsquo;t reason enough for any but a madwoman!</em>
The rain soaked his shaggy curls, laying them flat around his head,
before he darted through the stable door.</p>

<p>Moiraine was there before them, in an oiled cloak
still beaded with rain, and Nieda holding a lantern for Lan to
finish saddling the horses. There was an extra, a bay gelding with
an even stronger nose than Zarine&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will send pigeons every day,&rdquo; the stout woman was
saying. &ldquo;No one will suspect me. Fortune prick me! Even Whitecloaks
do speak well of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen to me, woman!&rdquo; Moiraine snapped. &ldquo;This is not
a Whitecloak or a Darkfriend I speak of. You will flee this city,
and make anyone you care for flee with you. For a dozen years you
have obeyed me. Obey me now!&rdquo; Nieda nodded, but reluctantly, and
Moiraine growled with exasperation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bay is yours, girl,&rdquo; Lan said to Zarine. &ldquo;Get on
his back. If you do not know how to ride, you must learn by doing,
or take my offer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Putting one hand on the high pommel, she vaulted
easily into the saddle. &ldquo;I was on a horse once, stone-face, now
that I think of it.&rdquo; She twisted around to tie her bundle behind
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you mean, Moiraine?&rdquo; Perrin demanded as he
tossed his saddlebag across Stepper&rsquo;s back. &ldquo;You said he would find
out where I am. He knows. The Gray Men!&rdquo; Nieda giggled, and he
wondered irritably how much she really knew or believed among the
things she said she did not believe in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sammael did not send the Gray Men.&rdquo; Moiraine mounted
Aldieb with a cool, straight-backed precision, almost as if there
were no hurry. &ldquo;The Darkhound was his, however. I believe it
followed my trail. He would not have sent both. Someone wants you,
but I do not think Sammael even knows you exist. Yet.&rdquo; Perrin
stopped with one foot in the stirrup, staring at her, but she
seemed more concerned with patting her mare&rsquo;s arching neck than
with the questions on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As well I went after you,&rdquo; Lan said, and the Aes
Sedai sniffed loudly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could wish you were a woman, Gaidin. I would send
you to the Tower as a novice to learn to obey!&rdquo; He raised an
eyebrow and touched the hilt of his sword, then swung into his
saddle, and she sighed. &ldquo;Perhaps it is as well you are disobedient.
Sometimes it is well. Besides, I do not think Sheriam and Siuan
Sanche together could teach you obedience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not understand,&rdquo; Perrin said. <em>I seem to be
saying that a great deal, and I&rsquo;m tired of it. I want some answers
I</em> can <em>understand</em>. He pulled himself the rest of the
way up so Moiraine would not be looking down at him; she had enough
advantage without that. &ldquo;If he did not send the Gray Men, who did?
If a Myrddraal, or another Forsaken&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He stopped to swallow.
<em>ANOTHER Forsaken! Light!</em> &ldquo;If somebody else sent them, why
did they not tell him? They&rsquo;re all Darkfriends, aren&rsquo;t they? And
why me, Moiraine? Why me? Rand is the bloody Dragon Reborn!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He heard the gasps from Zarine and Nieda, and only
then realized what he had said. Moiraine&rsquo;s stare seemed to skin him
like the sharpest steel. <em>Hasty bloody tongue. When did I stop
thinking before I speak?</em> It seemed to him it had happened when
he first felt Zarine&rsquo;s eyes watching him. She was watching him now,
with her mouth hanging open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are sealed to us, now,&rdquo; Moiraine told the
bold-faced woman. &ldquo;There is no turning back for you.
Ever.&rdquo; Zarine looked as if she wanted to say something and was
afraid to, but the Aes Sedai had already turned her attention
elsewhere. &ldquo;Nieda, flee Illian tonight. In this hour! And hold your
tongue even better than you have held it all these years. There are
those who would cut it out for what you could say, before I could
even find you.&rdquo; Her hard tone left doubts as to exactly how she
meant that, and Nieda nodded vigorously as if she had heard it both
ways.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for you, Perrin.&rdquo; The white mare moved closer,
and he leaned back from the Aes Sedai despite all he could do.
&ldquo;There are many threads woven in the Pattern, and some are as black
as the Shadow itself. Take care one of them does not strangle you.&rdquo;
Her heels touched Aldieb&rsquo;s flanks, and the mare darted into the
rain, Mandarb following close behind.</p>

<p><em>Burn you, Moiraine</em>, Perrin thought as he
rode after them. <em>Sometimes I do not know which side you are
on</em>. He glanced at Zarine, riding beside him as if she had been
born in a saddle. <em>And whose side are you on?</em></p>

<p>Rain kept people off the streets and canals, so no
visible eyes watched them go, but it made the footing uncertain for
the horses on the uneven paving stones. By the time they reached
the Maredo Causeway, a wide road of packed dirt stretching north
through the marsh, the downpour had begun to slacken. Thunder still
boomed, but the lightning flashed far behind them, perhaps out to
sea.</p>

<p>Perrin felt a bit of luck was coming their way. The
rain had stayed long enough to hide their departure, but now it
seemed they would have a clear night for riding. He said as much,
but Lan shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Darkhounds like clear, moonlit nights best,
blacksmith, rain the least. A good thunderstorm can keep them away
completely.&rdquo; As if his words had bidden it, the rain faded to a
faint drizzle. Perrin heard Loial groan behind him.</p>

<p>Causeway and marsh ended together, some two miles or
so from the city, but the road kept on, slowly bearing a little
eastward. Cloud-dark evening faded into night, and the misting rain
continued. Moiraine and Lan kept a steady, ground-eating pace. The
horses&rsquo; hooves splashed through puddles on the hard-packed dirt.
The moon shone through gaps in the clouds. Low hills began to rise
around them, and trees to appear more and more often. Perrin
thought there must be forest ahead, but he was not sure how he
liked the idea. Woods could hide them from pursuit; woods could let
pursuit come close before they saw.</p>

<p>A thin howl rose far behind them. For a moment he
thought it was a wolf; he surprised himself by nearly reaching out
to the wolf before he could stop. The cry came again, and he knew
it was no wolf. Others answered it, all miles behind, eerie wails
holding blood and death, cries that spoke of nightmares. To his
surprise, Lan and Moiraine slowed, the Aes Sedai studying the hills
around them in the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are a long way,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll not catch us
if we keep on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Darkhounds?&rdquo; Zarine muttered. &ldquo;Those are the
Darkhounds? Are you sure it isn&rsquo;t the Wild Hunt, Aes Sedai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is,&rdquo; Moiraine replied. &ldquo;It is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can never outrun the Darkhounds, blacksmith,&rdquo;
Lan said, &ldquo;not on the fastest horse. Always, you must face them and
defeat them, or they will pull you down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could have stayed in the <em>stedding</em>, you
know,&rdquo; Loial said. &ldquo;My mother would have had me married by now, but
it would not have been a bad life. Plenty of books. I did not have
to come Outside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; Moiraine said, pointing to a tall, treeless
mound well off to their right. There were no trees that Perrin
could see for two hundred paces or more around it, either, and they
were still sparse beyond that. &ldquo;We must see them coming to have a
chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Darkhounds&rsquo; dire cries rose again, closer, yet
still far.</p>

<p>Lan quickened Mandarb&rsquo;s pace a little, now that
Moiraine had chosen their ground. As they climbed, the horses&rsquo;
hooves clattered on rocks half-buried in the dirt and slicked by
the drizzle. To Perrin&rsquo;s eyes, most of them had too many squared
corners to be natural. At the top, they dismounted around what
seemed to be a low, rounded boulder. The moon appeared through a
gap in the clouds, and he found himself looking at a weathered
stone face two paces long. A woman&rsquo;s face, he thought from the
length of the hair. The rain made her seem to be weeping.</p>

<p>Moiraine dismounted and stood looking off in the
direction of the howls. She was a shadowed, hooded shape, rain
catching moonlight as it rolled down her oiled cloak.</p>

<p>Loial led his horse over to peer at the carving, then
bent closer and felt the features. &ldquo;I think she was an Ogier,&rdquo; he
said at last. &ldquo;But this is not an old <em>stedding</em>; I would
feel it. We all would. And we would be safe from Shadowspawn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you two staring at?&rdquo; Zarine squinted at the
rock. &ldquo;What is it? Her? Who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many nations have risen and fallen since the
Breaking,&rdquo; Moiraine said without turning, &ldquo;some leaving no more
than names on a yellowed page, or lines on a tattered map. Will we
leave as much behind?&rdquo; The blood-drenched howls rose again, still
closer. Perrin tried to calculate their pace, and thought Lan had
been right; the horses could not have outrun them, after all. They
would not have long to wait.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ogier,&rdquo; Lan said, &ldquo;you and the girl hold the
horses.&rdquo; Zarine protested, but he rode straight over to her. &ldquo;Your
knives will not do much good here, girl.&rdquo; His sword blade gleamed
in the moonlight as he drew it. &ldquo;Even this is a last resort. It
sounds like ten out there, not one. Your work is to keep the horses
from running when they smell the Darkhounds. Even Mandarb does not
like that smell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If the Warder&rsquo;s sword was no good, then neither was
the axe. Perrin felt something near to relief at that, even if they
were Shadowspawn; he would not have to use the axe. He drew the
length of his unstrung bow from under Stepper&rsquo;s saddle girths.
&ldquo;Maybe this will do some good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try if you wish, blacksmith,&rdquo; Lan said. &ldquo;They do not
die easily. Perhaps you will kill one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin drew a fresh bowstring from his pouch, trying
to shield it from the soft rain. The beeswax coating was thin, and
not much protection against prolonged damp. Setting the bow
slantwise between his legs, he bent it easily, fixing the loops of
the bowstring into the horn nocks at the ends of the bow. When he
straightened, he could see the Darkhounds.</p>

<p>They ran like horses at a gallop, and as he caught
sight of them, they gathered speed. They were only ten large shapes
running in the night, sweeping through the scattered trees, yet he
pulled a broadhead arrow from his quiver, nocked it but did not
draw. He had been far from the best bowman in Emond&rsquo;s Field, but
among the younger men, only Rand had been better.</p>

<p>At three hundred paces he would shoot, he decided.
<em>Fool! You&rsquo;d have a hard time hitting a target standing still at
that distance. But if I wait, the way they are moving</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Stepping up beside Moiraine, he raised his bow&mdash;<em>I just
have to imagine that moving shadow is a big dog</em>&mdash;drew
the goose-feather fletchings to his ear, and loosed. He was sure
the shaft merged with the nearest shadow, but the only result was a
snarl. <em>It is not going to work. They&rsquo;re coming too fast!</em>
He was already drawing another arrow. <em>Why aren&rsquo;t you doing
something, Moiraine?</em> He could see their eyes, shining like
silver, their teeth gleaming like burnished steel. Black as the
night itself and as big as small ponies, they sped toward him,
silent now, seeking the kill. The wind carried a stink near to
burned sulphur; the horses whickered fearfully, even Lan&rsquo;s
warhorse. <em>Burn you, Aes Sedai, do something!</em> He loosed
again; the frontmost Darkhound faltered and came on. <em>They can
die!</em> He shot once more, and the lead Darkhound tumbled,
staggered to its feet, then fell, yet even as it did he knew a
moment of despair. One down, and the other nine had covered two
thirds of the distance already; they seemed to be running even
faster, like shadows flowing across the ground. <em>One more arrow.
Time for one more, maybe, and then it&rsquo;s the axe. Burn you, Aes
Sedai!</em> He drew again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Moiraine said as his arrow left the bow. The
air between her hands caught fire and streaked toward the
Darkhounds, vanquishing night. The horses squealed and leaped
against being held.</p>

<p>Perrin threw an arm across his eyes to shield them
from a white-hot glare like burning, heat like a forge cracking
open; sudden noon flared in the darkness, and was gone. When he
uncovered his eyes, spots flickered across his vision, and the
faint, fading image of that line of fire. Where the Darkhounds had
been was nothing but night-covered ground and the soft rain; the
only shadows that moved were cast by clouds crossing the moon.</p>

<p><em>I thought she&rsquo;d throw fire at them, or call
lightning, but this</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; he asked
hoarsely.</p>

<p>Moiraine was peering off toward Illian again, as if
she could see through all those miles of darkness. &ldquo;Perhaps he did
not see,&rdquo; she said, almost to herself. &ldquo;It is far, and if he was
not watching, perhaps he did not notice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Zarine demanded. &ldquo;Sammael?&rdquo; Her voice shook a
little. &ldquo;You said he was in Illian. How could he see anything here?
What did you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something forbidden,&rdquo; Moiraine said coolly.
&ldquo;Forbidden by vows almost as strong as the Three Oaths.&rdquo; She took
Aldieb&rsquo;s reins from the girl, and patted the mare&rsquo;s neck, calming
her. &ldquo;Something not used in nearly two thousand years. Something I
might be stilled just for knowing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; Loial&rsquo;s voice was a faint boom.
&ldquo;Perhaps we should be going? There could be more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; the Aes Sedai said, mounting. &ldquo;He
would not loose two packs at once, even if he has two; they would
turn on each other instead of their prey. And I think we are not
his main quarry, or he would have come himself. We were&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;an
annoyance, I think&rdquo;&mdash;her tone was calm, but it was clear she
did not like being regarded so lightly&mdash;&ldquo;and perhaps a little
something extra to slip into his gamebag, if we were not too much
trouble. Still, there is small good in remaining any nearer him
than we must.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand?&rdquo; Perrin asked. He could almost feel Zarine
leaning forward to listen. &ldquo;If we are not what he hunts, is it
Rand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;Or perhaps Mat. Remember
that he is <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> also, and he blew the Horn of
Valere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zarine made a strangled sound. &ldquo;He <em>blew</em> it?
Someone has <em>found</em> it already?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai ignored her, leaning out of her saddle
to stare closely into Perrin&rsquo;s eyes, dark gleaming into burnished
gold. &ldquo;Once again events outpace me. I do not like that. And
neither should you. If events outrun me, they may well trample you,
and the rest of the world with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have many leagues to Tear yet,&rdquo; Lan said. &ldquo;The
Ogier&rsquo;s suggestion is a good one.&rdquo; He was already in his
saddle.</p>

<p>After a moment Moiraine straightened and touched the
mare&rsquo;s ribs with her heels. She was halfway down the side of the
mound before he could get his bow unstrung and take Stepper&rsquo;s reins
from Loial. <em>Burn you, Moiraine! I&rsquo;ll find some answers
somewhere!</em></p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Leaning back against a fallen log, Mat enjoyed the
warmth of the campfire&mdash;the rains had drifted south three
days earlier, but he still felt damp&mdash;yet right at that
moment, he was hardly aware of the dancing flames. He peered
thoughtfully at the small, wax-covered cylinder in his hand. Thom
was engrossed in tuning his harp, muttering to himself of rain and
wet, never glancing Mat&rsquo;s way. Crickets chirped in the dark thicket
around them. Caught between villages by sunset, they had chosen
this copse away from the road. Two nights they had tried to buy a
room for the night; twice a farmer had loosed his dogs on them.</p>

<p>Mat unsheathed his belt knife, and hesitated. <em>
Luck. It only explodes sometimes</em>, she said. Luck. As carefully
as he could, he slit along the length of the tube. It was a tube,
and of paper, as he had thought&mdash;he had found bits of paper
on the ground after fireworks were set off, back home&mdash;layers
of paper, but all that filled the inside was something that looked
like dirt, or maybe tiny gray-black pebbles and dust. He stirred
them on his palm with one finger. <em>How in the Light could
pebbles explode?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light burn me!&rdquo; Thom roared. He thrust his harp
into its case as if to protect it from what was in Mat&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Are
you trying to kill us, boy? Haven&rsquo;t you ever heard those things
explode ten times as hard for air as for fire? Fireworks are the
next thing to Aes Sedai work, boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Mat said, &ldquo;but Aludra did not look like any
Aes Sedai to me. I used to think that about Master al&rsquo;Vere&rsquo;s clock&mdash;that it had to be Aes Sedai work&mdash;but once I got the
back of the cabinet open, I saw it was full of little pieces of
metal.&rdquo; He shifted uncomfortably at the memory. Mistress al&rsquo;Vere
had been the first to reach him that time, with the Wisdom and his
father and the Mayor all right behind her, and none believing he
just meant to look. <em>I could have put them all back
together</em>. &ldquo;I think Perrin could make one, if he saw those
little wheels and springs and I don&rsquo;t know what all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would be surprised, boy,&rdquo; Thom said dryly. &ldquo;Even
a bad clock-maker is a fairly rich man, and they earn it. But a
clock does not explode in your face!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither did this. Well, it is useless, now.&rdquo; He
tossed the handful of paper and little pebbles into the fire to a
screech from Thom; the pebbles sparked and made tiny flashes, and
there was a smell of acrid smoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You <em>are</em> trying to kill us.&rdquo; Thom&rsquo;s voice
was unsteady, and it rose in intensity and pitch as he spoke. &ldquo;If I
decide I want to die, I will go to the Royal Palace when we reach
Caemlyn, and I&rsquo;ll pinch Morgase!&rdquo; His long mustaches flailed. &ldquo;Do
not do that again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It did not explode,&rdquo; Mat said, frowning at the fire.
He fished into the oiled-cloth roll on the other side of the log
and pulled out a firework of the next larger size. &ldquo;I wonder why
there was no bang.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not care why there was no bang! Do not do it
again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat glanced at him and laughed. &ldquo;Stop shaking, Thom.
There&rsquo;s no need to be afraid. I know what is inside them, now. At
least, I know what it looks like, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t say it. I will
not be cutting any more open, Thom. It is more fun to set them off,
anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not afraid, you mud-footed swineherd,&rdquo; Thom
said with elaborate dignity. &ldquo;I am shaking with rage because I&rsquo;m
traveling with a goat-brained lout who might kill the pair of us
because he cannot think past his own&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho, the fire!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat exchanged glances with Thom as horses&rsquo; hooves
approached. It was late for anyone honest to be traveling. But the
Queen&rsquo;s Guards kept the roads safe this close to Caemlyn, and the
four who rode into the firelight certainly did not look like
robbers. One was a woman. The men all wore long cloaks and seemed
to be her retainers, while she was pretty and blue-eyed, in gold
necklace and a gray silk dress and a velvet cloak with a wide hood.
The men dismounted. One held her reins and another her stirrup, and
she smiled at Mat, doffing her gloves as she came near the
fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear we are caught out late, young master,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;and I would trouble you for directions to an inn, if you
know one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He grinned and started to rise. He had made it as far
as a crouch when he heard one of the men mutter something, and
another produced a crossbow from under his cloak, already drawn,
with a clip holding the bolt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kill him, fool!&rdquo; the woman shouted, and Mat tossed
the firework into the flames and threw himself toward his
quarterstaff. There was a loud bang and a flash of light&mdash;&ldquo;Aes Sedai!&rdquo; a man cried. &ldquo;Fireworks, fool!&rdquo; the woman shouted&mdash;and he rolled to his feet with the staff in his hand to see
the crossbow bolt sticking out of the fallen log almost where he
had been sitting, and the crossbowman falling with the hilt of one
of Thom&rsquo;s knives adorning his chest.</p>

<p>It was all he had time to see, for the other two men
darted past the fire at him, drawing swords. One of them suddenly
stumbled to his knees, dropping his sword to claw at the knife in
his back as he fell facedown. The last man did not see his
companion fall; he obviously expected to be one of a pair, dividing
their opponent&rsquo;s attention, as he thrust his blade at Mat&rsquo;s middle.
Feeling almost contemptuous, Mat cracked the fellow&rsquo;s wrist with
one end of his staff, sending the sword flying, and cracked his
forehead with the other. The man&rsquo;s eyes rolled up in his head as he
collapsed.</p>

<p>From the corner of his eye, Mat saw the woman walking
toward him, and he stuck a finger at her like a knife. &ldquo;Fine
clothes you wear for a thief, woman! You sit down till I decide
what to do with you, or I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked as surprised as Mat at the knife that
suddenly bloomed in her throat, a red flower of spreading blood. He
took a half step, as if to catch her as she fell, knowing it was no
good. Her long cloak settled over her, covering everything but her
face, and the hilt of Thom&rsquo;s knife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn you,&rdquo; Mat muttered. &ldquo;Burn you, Thom Merrilin! A
woman! Light, we could have tied her up, given her to the Queen&rsquo;s
Guards tomorrow in Caemlyn. Light, I might even have let her go.
She&rsquo;d rob nobody without these three, and the only one that lives
will be days before he can see straight and months before he can
hold a sword. Burn you, Thom, there was no need to kill her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gleeman limped to where the woman lay, and kicked
back her cloak. The dagger had half fallen from her hand, its blade
as wide as Mat&rsquo;s thumb and two hands long. &ldquo;Would you rather I had
waited till she nested that in your ribs, boy?&rdquo; He retrieved his
own knife, wiping the blade on her cloak.</p>

<p>Mat realized he was humming. &ldquo;She Wore a Mask That
Hid Her Face,&rdquo; and stopped it. He bent down and hid hers with the
hood of her cloak. &ldquo;Best we move on,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;I do nor
want to have to explain this if a patrol of the Guards happens
by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With her in those clothes?&rdquo; Thom said. &ldquo;I should say
not! They must have robbed a merchant&rsquo;s wife, or some noblewoman&rsquo;s
carriage.&rdquo; His voice became gentler. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re going, boy, you had
best see to saddling your horse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat gave a start and pulled his eyes from the dead
woman. &ldquo;Yes, I had better, hadn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; He did not look at her
again.</p>

<p>He had no such compunction about the men. As far as
he was concerned, a man who decided to rob and kill deserved what
he got when he lost the game. He did not dwell on them, but neither
did he jerk his eyes away if they fell on one of the robbers. It
was after he had saddled his gelding and tied his things on behind,
while he was kicking dirt onto the fire, that he found himself
looking at the man who had shot the crossbow. There was something
familiar about those features, about the way the smothering fire
made shadows across them. <em>Luck</em>, he told himself. <em>
Always the luck</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The crossbowman was a good swimmer, Thom,&rdquo; he said
as he climbed into the saddle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What foolery are you talking, now?&rdquo; The gleeman was
on his horse, too, and far more concerned with how his instrument
cases rode behind his saddle than he was in the dead. &ldquo;How could
you know whether he could even swim at all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He made it ashore from a small boat in the middle of
the Erinin in the middle of the night. I guess that used up all his
luck.&rdquo; He checked the lashings on the roll of fireworks again. <em>
If that fool thought one of these was Aes Sedai, I wonder what he&rsquo;d
have thought if they</em> all <em>went off</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure, boy? The chances of it being the same
man&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Why, even you wouldn&rsquo;t lay a wager against those
odds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure, Thom.&rdquo; <em>Elayne, I will wring your neck
when I put my hands on you. And Egwene&rsquo;s and Nynaeve&rsquo;s, too</em>.
&ldquo;And I am sure I intend to have this bloody letter out of my hands
an hour after we reach Caemlyn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you, there is nothing in that letter, boy. I
played <em>Daes Dae&rsquo;mar</em> when I was younger than you, and I can
recognize a code or a cipher even when I don&rsquo;t know what it
says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I never played your Great Game, Thom, your
bloody Game of Houses, but I know when someone is chasing me, and
they&rsquo;d not be chasing this hard or this far for the gold in my
pockets, not for less than a chest full of gold. It has to be the
letter.&rdquo; <em>Burn me, pretty girls always get me in trouble</em>.
&ldquo;Do you feel like sleeping tonight, after this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With the sleep of an innocent babe, boy. But if you
want to ride, I&rsquo;ll ride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The face of a pretty woman floated into Mat&rsquo;s head,
with a dagger in her throat. <em>You had no luck, pretty
woman</em>. &ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s ride!&rdquo; he said savagely.</p>
