Warder&rsquo;s long legs outdistanced Perrin&rsquo;s, and by
the time he pushed through the throng outside the inn doors, Lan
was already striding up the stairs, not seeming in any particular
hurry. Perrin made himself walk as slowly. From the doorway behind
him came grumbles about people pushing ahead of other people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again?&rdquo; Orban was saying, holding his silver cup up
to be refilled. &ldquo;Aye, very well. They lay in ambush close beside
the road we traveled, and an ambush I did not expect so close to
Remen. Screaming, they rushed upon us from the crowding brush. In a
breath they were in our midst, their spears stabbing, slaying two
of my best men and one of Gann&rsquo;s immediately. Aye, I knew Aiel when
I saw them, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin hurried up the stairs. <em>Well, Orban knows
them now</em>.</p>

<p>Voices came from behind Moiraine&rsquo;s door. He did not
want to hear what she had to say about this. He hurried past to
stick his head into Loial&rsquo;s room.</p>

<p>The Ogier bed was a low, massive thing, twice as long
and half as wide as any human bed Perrin had ever seen. It took up
much of the room, and that was as large and as fine as Moiraine&rsquo;s.
Perrin vaguely remembered Loial saying something about it being
sung wood, and at any other time he might have stopped to admire
those flowing curves that made it seem as if the bed had somehow
grown where it stood. Ogier really must have stopped in Remen at
some time in the past, for the innkeeper had also found a wooden
armchair that fit Loial, and filled it with cushions. The Ogier was
comfortably sitting on them in his shirt and breeches, idly
scratching a bare ankle with a toenail as he wrote in a large,
cloth-bound book on an arm of the chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re leaving!&rdquo; Perrin said.</p>

<p>Loial gave a jump, nearly upsetting his ink bottle
and almost dropping the book. &ldquo;Leaving? We only just arrived,&rdquo; he
rumbled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, leaving. Meet us at the stable as quickly as
you can. And don&rsquo;t let anyone see you go. I think there&rsquo;s a back
stair that runs down by the kitchen.&rdquo; The smell of food at his end
of the hall had been too strong for there not to be.</p>

<p>The Ogier gave one regretful look at the bed, then
started tugging on his high boots. &ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Whitecloaks,&rdquo; Perrin said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you more
later.&rdquo; He ducked back out before Loial could ask any more.</p>

<p>He had not unpacked. Once he had belted on his
quiver, slung his cloak around him, tossed blanketroll and
saddlebags on his shoulder, and picked up his bow, there was no
sign he had ever been there. Not a wrinkle in the folded blankets
at the foot of the bed, not a splash of water in the cracked basin
on the washstand. Even the tallow candle still had a fresh wick, he
realized. <em>I must have known I would not be staying. I don&rsquo;t
seem to leave any mark behind me, of late</em>.</p>

<p>As he had suspected, a narrow stair at the back led
down to a hall that ran out past the kitchen. He peered cautiously
into the kitchen. A spit dog trotted in his big wicker wheel,
turning a long spit that held a haunch of lamb, a large piece of
beef, five chickens, and a goose. Fragrant steam rose from a soup
cauldron hanging from a sturdy crane over a second hearth. But
there was not a cook to be seen, nor any living soul except the
dog. Thankful for Orban&rsquo;s lies he hurried on into the night.</p>

<p>The stable was a large structure of the same stone as
the inn, though only the stone faces around the big doors had been
polished. A single lantern hanging from a stallpost gave a dim
light. Stepper and the other horses stood in stalls near the doors;
Loial&rsquo;s big mount nearly filled his. The smell of hay and horses
was familiar and comforting. Perrin was the first to arrive.</p>

<p>There was only one stableman on duty, a narrow-faced
fellow in a dirty shirt, with lanky gray hair, who demanded to know
who Perrin was to order four horses saddled, and who was his
master, and what he was doing all bundled up to travel in the
middle of the night, and did Master Furlan know he was sneaking off
like this, and what did he have hidden in those saddlebags, and
what was wrong with his eyes, was he sick?</p>

<p>A coin flipped through the air from behind Perrin,
glinting gold in the lantern light. The stableman snagged it with
one hand and bit it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Saddle them,&rdquo; Lan said. His voice was soft, as cold
iron is soft, and the stableman bobbed a bow and scurried to make
the horses ready.</p>

<p>Moiraine and Loial came into the stable just as they
could take up their reins, and then they were all leading their
horses behind Lan, off down a street that ran behind the stable
toward the river. The soft clop of the horses&rsquo; hooves on the paving
blocks attracted only a slat-ribbed dog that barked once and ran
away as they went by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This brings back memories, doesn&rsquo;t it, Perrin?&rdquo;
Loial said, quietly for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep your voice down,&rdquo; Perrin whispered. &ldquo;What
memories?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it is like old times.&rdquo; The Ogier had managed to
mute his voice; he sounded like a bumblebee only the size of a dog
instead of a horse. &ldquo;Sneaking away in the night, with enemies
behind us, and maybe enemies ahead, and danger in the air, and the
cold tang of adventure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin frowned at Loial over Stepper&rsquo;s saddle. It was
easy enough; his eyes cleared the saddle, and Loial stood head and
shoulders and chest above it on the other side. &ldquo;What are you
talking about? I believe you are coming to like danger! Loial, you
must be crazy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am only fixing the mood in my head,&rdquo; Loial said,
sounding formal. Or perhaps defensive. &ldquo;For my book. I have to put
it all in. I believe I am coming to like it. Adventuring. Of
course, I am.&rdquo; His ears gave two violent twitches. &ldquo;I have to like
it if I wish to write of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin shook his head.</p>

<p>At the stone wharves the barge-like ferries lay
snugged for the night, still and dark, as did most of the ships.
Lantern lights and people moved around on the dock alongside a
two-masted vessel, though, and on the deck as well. The main smells
were tar and rope, with strong hints of fish, though something back
in the nearest warehouse gave off sharp, spicy aromas that the
others nearly submerged.</p>

<p>Lan located the captain, a short, slight man with an
odd way of holding his head tilted to one side while he listened.
The bargaining was over soon enough, and booms and sling rigged to
hoist the horses aboard. Perrin kept a close eye on the horses,
talking to them; horses had little tolerance for the unusual, such
as being lifted into the air, but even the Warder&rsquo;s stallion seemed
soothed by his murmurs.</p>

<p>Lan gave gold to the captain, and silver to two
sailors who ran barefoot to a warehouse for sacks of oats. More
crewmen tethered the horses between the masts in a sort of small
pen made of rope, all the while muttering about the mess they would
have to clean. Perrin did not think anyone was supposed to
overhear, but his ears caught the words. The men were just not used
to horses.</p>

<p>In short order the <em>Snow Goose</em> was ready to
sail, only a little ahead of what the captain&mdash;his name was
Jaim Adarra&mdash;had intended. Lan led Moiraine below as the
lines were cast off, and Loial followed yawning. Perrin stayed at
the railing near the bow, though the Ogier&rsquo;s every yawn had
summoned one of his own. He wondered if the <em>Snow Goose</em>
could outrun wolves down the river, outrun dreams. Men began
readying the sweeps to push the vessel away from the wharf.</p>

<p>As the last line was tossed ashore and seized by a
dockman, a girl in narrow, divided skirts burst out of the shadows
between two warehouses, a bundle in her arms and a dark cloak
streaming behind her. She leaped onto the deck just as the men at
the sweeps began pushing off.</p>

<p>Adarra bustled from his place by the tiller, but she
calmly set down her bundle and said briskly, &ldquo;I will take passage
downriver&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;oh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;say, as far as he is going.&rdquo; She nodded
toward Perrin without looking at him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no objections to
sleeping on deck. Cold and wet do not bother me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few minutes of bargaining followed. She passed over
three silver marks, frowned at the coppers she got back, then
stuffed them into her purse and came forward to stand beside
Perrin.</p>

<p>She had an herbal scent to her, light and fresh and
clean. Those dark, tilted eyes regarded him over high cheekbones,
then turned to look back toward shore. She was about his own age,
he decided; he could not decide if her nose fit her face, or
dominated it. <em>You are a fool, Perrin Aybara. Why care what she
looks like?</em></p>

<p>The gap to the wharf was a good twenty paces, now;
the sweeps dug in, cutting white furrows in black water. For a
moment he considered tossing her over the side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said after a moment, &ldquo;I never expected my
travels to take me back to Illian so soon as this.&rdquo; Her voice was
high, and she had a flat way of speaking, but it was not
unpleasant. &ldquo;You <em>are</em> going to Illian, are you not?&rdquo; He
tightened his mouth. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sulk,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You left quite a mess
back there, you and that Aielman between you. The uproar was just
beginning when I left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not tell them?&rdquo; he said in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The townsfolk think the Aielman chewed through the
chain, or broke it with his bare hands. They had not decided which
when I left.&rdquo; She made a sound suspiciously like a giggle. &ldquo;Orban
was quite loud in his disgust that his wounds would keep him from
hunting down the Aielman personally.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin snorted. &ldquo;If he ever sees an Aiel again, he&rsquo;ll
bloody soil himself.&rdquo; He cleared his throat and muttered,
&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know about that,&rdquo; she said, as if his
remark had been nothing out of the way. &ldquo;I saw him in Jehannah
during the winter. He fought four men together, killed two and made
the other two yield. Of course, he started the fight, so that takes
something away from it, but they knew what they were doing. He did
not pick a fight with men who could not defend themselves. Still,
he is a fool. He has these peculiar ideas about the Great
Blackwood. What some call the Forest of Shadows. Have you ever
heard of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He eyed her sideways. She spoke of fighting and
killing as calmly as another woman might speak of baking. He had
never heard of any Great Blackwood, but the Forest of Shadows lay
just south of the Two Rivers. &ldquo;Are you following me? You were
staring at me, back at the inn. Why? And why didn&rsquo;t you tell them
what you saw?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An Ogier,&rdquo; she said, staring at the river, &ldquo;is
obviously an Ogier, and the others were not much more difficult to
figure out. I managed a much better look inside <em>Lady
Alys</em>&rsquo;s hood than Orban did, and her face makes that
stone-faced fellow a Warder. The Light burn me if I&rsquo;d want that one
angry with me. Does he always look like that, or did he eat a rock
for his last meal? Anyway, that left only you. I do not like things
I cannot account for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once again he considered tossing her over the side.
Seriously, this time, But Remen was now only a blotch of light well
behind them in the darkness, and no telling how far it was to
shore.</p>

<p>She seemed to take his silence as an urging to go on.
&ldquo;So there I have an&rdquo;&mdash;she looked around, then dropped her
voice, though the closest crewman was working a sweep ten feet away&mdash;&ldquo;an Aes Sedai, a Warder, an Ogier&mdash;and you. A
countryman, by first look at you.&rdquo; Her tilted eyes rose to study
his yellow ones intently&mdash;he refused to look away&mdash;and
she smiled. &ldquo;Only you free a caged Aielman, hold a long talk with
him, then help him chop a dozen Whitecloaks into sausage. I assume
you do this regularly; you certainly looked as if it were nothing
out of the ordinary for you. I scent something strange in a party
of travelers such as yours, and strange trails are what Hunters
look for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He blinked; there was no mistaking that emphasis. &ldquo;A
Hunter? You? You cannot be a Hunter. You&rsquo;re a girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her smile became so innocent that he almost walked
away from her. She stepped back, made a flourish with each hand,
and was holding two knives as neatly as old Thom Merrilin could
have done it. One of the men at the sweeps made a choking sound,
and two others stumbled; sweeps thrashed and tangled, and the <em>
Snow Goose</em> lurched a little before the captain&rsquo;s shouts set
things right. By that time, the black-haired girl had made the
knives disappear again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nimble fingers and nimble wits will take you a good
deal further than a sword and muscles. Sharp eyes help, as well,
but fortunately, I have these things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And modesty, as well,&rdquo; Perrin murmured. She did not
seem to notice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I took the oath and received the blessing in the
Great Square of Tammaz, in Illian. Perhaps I was the youngest, but
in that crowd, with all the trumpets and drums and cymbals and
shouting&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;A six-year-old could have taken the oath, and none
would have noticed. There were over a thousand of us, perhaps two,
and every one with an idea of where to find the Horn of Valere. I
have mine&mdash;it still may be the right one&mdash;but no Hunter
can afford to pass up a strange trail. The Horn will certainly lie
at the end of a strange trail, and I have never seen one any
stranger than the trail you four make. Where are you bound? Illian?
Somewhere else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was your idea?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;About where the Horn
is?&rdquo; <em>Safe in Tar Valon, I hope, and the Light send I never see
it again</em>. &ldquo;You think it&rsquo;s in Ghealdan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She frowned at him&mdash;he had the feeling she did
not give up a scent once she had raised it, but he was ready to
offer her as many side trails as she would take&mdash;then said,
&ldquo;Have you ever heard of Manetheren?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He nearly choked. &ldquo;I have heard of it,&rdquo; he said
cautiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every queen of Manetheren was an Aes Sedai, and the
king the Warder bound to her. I can&rsquo;t imagine a place like that,
but that is what the books say. It was a large land&mdash;most of
Andor and Ghealdan and more besides&mdash;but the capital, the
city itself, was in the Mountains of Mist. That is where I think
the Horn is. Unless you four lead me to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His hackles stirred. She was lecturing him as if he
were an untaught village lout. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not find the Horn or
Manetheren. The city was destroyed during the Trolloc Wars, when
the last queen drew too much of the One Power to destroy the
Dreadlords who had killed her husband.&rdquo; Moiraine had told him the
names of that king and queen, but he did not remember them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in Manetheren, farmboy,&rdquo; she said calmly,
&ldquo;though a land such as that would make a good hiding place. But
there were other nations, other cities, in the Mountains of Mist,
so old that not even Aes Sedai remember them. And think of all
those stories about it being bad luck to enter the mountains. What
better place for the Horn to be hidden than in one of those
forgotten cities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard stories of something being hidden in
the mountains.&rdquo; Would she believe him? He had never been good at
lying. &ldquo;The stories did not say what, but it&rsquo;s supposed to be the
greatest treasure in the world, so maybe it is the Horn. But the
Mountains of Mist stretch for hundreds of leagues. If you are going
to find it, you should not waste time following us. You&rsquo;ll need it
all to find the Horn before Orban and Gann.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you, those two have some strange idea the
Horn is hidden in the Great Blackwood.&rdquo; She smiled up at him. Her
mouth was not too big at all, when she smiled. &ldquo;And I told you a
Hunter has to follow strange trails. You are lucky Orban and Gann
were injured fighting all those Aielmen, or they might well be
aboard, too. At least I will not get in your way, or try to take
over, or pick a fight with the Warder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He growled disgustedly. &ldquo;We are just travelers on our
way to Illian, girl. What is your name? If I have to share this
ship with you for days yet, I can&rsquo;t keep calling you girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I call myself Mandarb.&rdquo; He could not stop the guffaw
that burst out of him. Those tilted eyes regarded him with heat. &ldquo;I
will teach you something, farmboy.&rdquo; Her voice remained level.
Barely. &ldquo;In the Old Tongue, Mandarb means &lsquo;blade.&rsquo; It is a name
worthy of a Hunter of the Horn!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He managed to get his laughter under control, and
hardly wheezed at all as he pointed to the rope pen between the
masts. &ldquo;You see that black stallion? His name is Mandarb.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The heat went out of her eyes, and spots of color
bloomed on her cheeks. &ldquo;Oh. I was born Zarine Bashere, but Zarine
is no name for a Hunter. In the stories, Hunters have names like
Rogosh Eagle-eye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked so crestfallen that he hastened to say, &ldquo;I
like the name Zarine. It suits you.&rdquo; The heat flashed back into her
eyes, and for a moment he thought she was about to produce one of
her knives again. &ldquo;It is late, Zarine. I want some sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned his back to start for the hatch that led
belowdeck, prickles running across his shoulders. Crewmen still
padded up the deck and back, working the sweeps. <em>Fool. A girl
would not stick a knife in me. Not with all these people watching.
Would she?</em> Just as he reached the hatch, she called to
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Farmboy! Perhaps I will call myself Faile. My father
used to call me that, when I was little. It means &lsquo;falcon.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stiffened and almost missed the first step of the
ladder. <em>Coincidence</em>. He made himself go down without
looking back toward her. <em>It has to be</em>. The passageway was
dark, but enough moonlight filtered down behind him for him to make
his way. Someone was snoring loudly in one of the cabins. <em>Min,
why did you have to go seeing things?</em></p>
