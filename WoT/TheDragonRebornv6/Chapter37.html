<h4><em>Fires in Cairhien</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">E</span>gwene
returned a graceful nod to the respectful bow
of the ship&rsquo;s crewman who padded past her, barefoot, on his way to
pull a rope that already seemed taut, possibly shifting a trifle
the way one of the big square sails set. As he trotted back toward
where the round-faced captain stood by the tillerman, he bowed
again, and she nodded once more before returning her attentions to
the forested Cairhien shore, separated from the <em>Blue Crane</em>
by less than twenty spans of water.</p>

<p>A village was sliding past, or what had been a
village once. Half the houses were only smoldering piles of rubble
with chimneys sticking starkly out of the ruins. On the other
houses, doors swung with the wind, and pieces of furniture, bits of
clothing and houseware littered the dirt street, tumbled about as
if thrown. Nothing living moved in the village except for one
half-starved dog that ignored the passing ship as it trotted out of
sight behind the toppled walls of what appeared to have been an
inn. She could never see such a sight without a queasiness settling
in her belly, but she tried to maintain the dispassionate serenity
she thought an Aes Sedai might have. It did not help much. Beyond
the village, a thick plume of smoke was rising into the sky. Three
or four miles off, she estimated.</p>

<p>This was not the first such plume of smoke she had
seen since the Erinin began to flow along the border of Cairhien,
nor the first such village. At least this time there were no bodies
in sight. Captain Ellisor sometimes had to sail close to the
Cairhienin shore because of mudflats&mdash;he said they shifted in
this part of the river&mdash;but however close he came, she had
not seen a single living person.</p>

<p>The village and the smoke plume slipped away behind
the ship, but already another column of smoke was coming into view
ahead, further from the river. The forest was thinning, ash and
leatherleaf and black elder giving way to willow and whitewood and
wateroak, and some she did not recognize.</p>

<p>The wind caught her cloak, but she let it stream,
feeling the cold cleanness of the air, feeling the freedom of
wearing brown instead of any sort of white, though it had not been
her first choice. Yet dress and cloak were of the best wool, well
cut and well sewn.</p>

<p>Another sailor trotted by, bowing as he went. She
vowed to learn at least some of what it was they were doing; she
did not like feeling ignorant. Wearing her Great Serpent ring on
her right hand made for a good deal of bowing with a captain and
crew born mainly in Tar Valon.</p>

<p>She had won that argument with Nynaeve, though
Nynaeve had been sure she herself was the only one of the three of
them old enough for people to believe she was Aes Sedai. But
Nynaeve had been wrong. Egwene was ready to admit that both she and
Elayne had received startled looks on boarding the <em>Blue
Crane</em> that afternoon at Southharbor, and Captain Ellisor&rsquo;s
eyebows had climbed almost to where his hair would have begun had
he had any, but he had been all smiles and bows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An honor, Aes Sedai. Three Aes Sedai to travel on my
vessel? An honor indeed. I promise you a quick journey as far as
you wish. And no trouble with Cairhienin brigands. I no longer put
in on that side of the river. Unless you wish it, of course, Aes
Sedai. Andoran soldiers do hold a few towns on the Cairhienin side.
An honor, Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His eyebrows had shot up again when they asked for
just one cabin among them&mdash;not even Nynaeve wanted to be
alone at night if she did not have to be. Each could have a cabin
to herself at no extra charge, he told them; he had no other
passengers, his cargo was aboard, and if Aes Sedai had urgent
business downriver, he would not wait even an hour for anyone else
who might want passage. They said again that one cabin would be
sufficient.</p>

<p>He was startled, and it had been plain from his face
that he did not understand, but Chin Ellisor, born and bred in Tar
Valon, was not one to question Aes Sedai once they made their
intentions clear. If two of them seemed very young, well, some Aes
Sedai were young.</p>

<p>The abandoned ruins vanished behind Egwene. The
column of smoke drew closer, and there was a hint of another much
further still from the riverbank. The forest was turning to low,
grassy hills dotted with thickets. Trees that made flowers in the
spring had them, tiny white blossoms on snowberry and bright red
sugarberry. One tree she did not know was covered in round white
flowers bigger than her two hands together. Occasionally a climbing
wildrose put swaths of yellow or white through branches thick with
the green of leaves and the red of new growth. It was all too sharp
a contrast to the ashes and rubble to be entirely pleasant.</p>

<p>Egwene wished she had an Aes Sedai to question
herself right then. One she could trust. Brushing her pouch with
her fingers, she could barely feel the twisted stone ring of the
<em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> inside.</p>

<p>She had tried it every night but two since leaving
Tar Valon, and it had not worked the same way twice. Oh, she always
found herself in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, but the only thing she
saw that might have been any use was the Heart of the Stone again,
each time without Silvie to tell her things. There was certainly
nothing about the Black Ajah.</p>

<p>Her own dreams, without the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, had
been filled with images that seemed almost like glimpses of the
Unseen World. Rand holding a sword that blazed like the sun, till
she could hardly see that it was a sword, could hardly make out
that it was him at all. Rand threatened in a dozen ways, none of
them the least bit real. In one dream he had been on a huge stones
board, the black and white stones as big as boulders, and him
dodging the monstrous hands that moved them and seemed to try to
crush him under them. It could have meant something. It very
probably did, but beyond the fact that Rand was in danger from
someone, or two someones&mdash;she thought that much was clear&mdash;beyond that, she simply did not know. <em>I cannot help him,
now. I have my own duty. I don&rsquo;t even know where he is, except that
it is probably five hundred leagues from here</em>.</p>

<p>She had dreamed of Perrin with a wolf, and with a
falcon, and a hawk&mdash;and the falcon and the hawk fighting&mdash;of Perrin running from someone deadly, and Perrin stepping
willingly over the edge of a towering cliff while saying, &ldquo;It must
be done. I must learn to fly before I reach the bottom.&rdquo; There had
been one dream of an Aiel, and she thought that had to do with
Perrin, too, but she was not sure. And a dream of Min, springing a
steel trap but somehow walking through it without so much as seeing
it. There had been dreams of Mat, too. Of Mat with dice spinning
&rsquo;round him&mdash;she felt she knew where that one came from&mdash;of Mat being followed by a man who was not there&mdash;she still
did not understand that; there was a man following, or maybe more
than one, but in some way there was no one there&mdash;of Mat
riding desperately toward something unseen in the distance that he
had to reach, and Mat with a woman who seemed to be tossing
fireworks about. An Illuminator, she assumed, but that made no more
sense than anything else.</p>

<p>She had had so many dreams that she was beginning to
doubt them all. Maybe it had to do with using the <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em> so often, or maybe with just carrying it. Maybe
she was finally learning what a Dreamer did. Frantic dreams, hectic
dreams. Men and women breaking out of a cage, then putting on
crowns. A woman playing with puppets, and another dream where the
strings on puppets led to the hands of larger puppets, and their
strings led to still greater puppets, on and on until the last
strings vanished into unimaginable heights. Kings dying, queens
weeping, battles raging. Whitecloaks ravaging the Two Rivers. She
had even dreamed of the Seanchan again. More than once. Those she
shut away in a dark corner; she would not let herself think of
them. Her mother and father, every night.</p>

<p>She was certain what that meant, at least, or thought
she was. <em>It means I&rsquo;m off hunting the Black Ajah, and I do not
know what my dreams mean or how to make the fool</em> ter&rsquo;angreal <em>do
what it should, and I&rsquo;m frightened, and</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>And
homesick</em>. For an instant she thought how good it would be to
have her mother send her up to bed knowing everything would be
better in the morning. <em>Only mother can&rsquo;t solve my problems for
me anymore, and father can&rsquo;t promise to chase away monsters and
make me believe it. I have to do it myself now</em>.</p>

<p>How far in the past all that was, now. She did not
want it back, not really, but it had been a warm time, and it
seemed so long ago. It would be wonderful just to see them again,
to hear their voices. <em>When I wear this ring on the finger I
choose by right</em>.</p>

<p>She had finally let Nynaeve and Elayne each try
sleeping one night with the stone ring&mdash;surprised at how
reluctant she had been to let it out of her own hands&mdash;and
they had awakened to speak of what was surely <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, but neither had seen more than a glimpse of
the Heart of the Stone, nothing that was of any use.</p>

<p>The thick column of smoke now lay abreast of the <em>
Blue Crane</em>. Perhaps five or six miles from the river, she
thought. The other was only a smudge on the horizon. It could
almost have been a cloud, but she was sure it was not. Small
thickets grew tight along the riverbank in some places, and between
them the grass came right down to the water except where an
undercut bank had fallen in.</p>

<p>Elayne came on deck and joined her at the rail, the
wind whipping her dark cloak as well. She wore sturdy wool, too.
That had been one argument Nynaeve won. Their clothes. Egwene had
maintained that Aes Sedai always wore the best, even when they
traveled&mdash;she had been thinking of the silks she wore in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>&mdash;but Nynaeve pointed out that even with
as much gold as the Amyrlin had left in the back of her wardrobe,
and it was a fat purse, they still had no idea how much things
would cost downriver. The servants said Mat had been right about
the civil war in Cairhien, and what it had done to prices. To
Egwene&rsquo;s surprise, Elayne had pointed out that Brown sisters wore
wool more often than silk. Elayne had been so eager to be away from
the kitchen, Egwene thought, she would have worn rags.</p>

<p><em>I wonder how Mat is doing? No doubt trying to
dice with the captain for whatever ship he&rsquo;s traveling on</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Terrible,&rdquo; Elayne murmured. &ldquo;It is so terrible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is?&rdquo; Egwene said absently. <em>I hope he isn&rsquo;t
showing that paper we gave him around too freely</em>.</p>

<p>Elayne gave her a startled look, and then a frown.
&ldquo;That!&rdquo; She gestured toward the distant smoke. &ldquo;How can you ignore
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can ignore it because I do not want to think of
what the people are going through, because I cannot do anything
about it, and because we have to reach Tear. Because what we&rsquo;re
hunting is in Tear.&rdquo; She was surprised at her own vehemence. <em>
I</em> can&rsquo;t <em>do anything about it. And the Black Ajah is in
Tear</em>.</p>

<p>The more she thought of it, the more certain she
became that they would have to find a way into the Heart of the
Stone. Perhaps no one but the High Lords of Tear were allowed into
it, but she was becoming convinced that the key to springing the
Black Ajah&rsquo;s trap and thwarting them lay in the Heart of the
Stone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know all of that, Egwene, but it does not stop me
feeling for the Cairhienin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard lectures about the wars Andor fought
with Cairhien,&rdquo; Egwene said dryly. &ldquo;Bennae Sedai says you and
Cairhien have fought more often than any two nations except Tear
and Illian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other woman gave her a sidelong look. Elayne had
never gotten used to Egwene&rsquo;s refusal to admit she was Andoran
herself. At least, lines on maps said the Two Rivers was part of
Andor, and Elayne believed the maps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have fought wars against them, Egwene, but since
the damage they suffered in the Aiel War, Andor has sold them
nearly as much grain as Tear has. The trade has stopped, now. With
every Cairhienin House fighting every other for the Sun Throne, who
would buy the grain, or see it distributed to the people? If the
fighting is as bad as what we&rsquo;ve seen on the banks&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Well. You
cannot feed a people for twenty years and feel nothing for them
when they must be starving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Gray Man,&rdquo; Egwene said, and Elayne jumped, trying
to look in every direction at once. The glow of <em>saidar</em>
surrounded her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene took a slower look around the decks, but to
make sure no one was close enough to overhear. Captain Ellisor
still stood in the stern, by the shirtless man holding the long
tiller. Another sailor was up in the very bow, scanning the waters
ahead for signs of submerged mudbanks, and two more padded about
the deck, now and again adjusting a rope to the sails. The rest of
the crew were all below. One of the pair stopped to check the
lashings on the rowboat tied upside down on the deck; she waited
for him to go on before speaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; she muttered softly. &ldquo;Me, Elayne, not you, so
don&rsquo;t glower at me like that.&rdquo; She continued in a whisper. &ldquo;A Gray
Man is after Mat, Elayne. That must be what that dream meant, but I
never saw it. I am a fool!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The glow around Elayne vanished. &ldquo;Do not be so hard
on yourself,&rdquo; she whispered back. &ldquo;Perhaps it does mean that, but I
did not see it, and neither did Nynaeve.&rdquo; She paused; red-gold
curls swung as she shook her head. &ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t make sense,
Egwene. Why would a Gray Man be after Mat? There is nothing in my
letter to my mother that could harm us in the slightest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know why.&rdquo; Egwene frowned. &ldquo;There has to be
a reason. I am sure that is what that dream means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if you are right, Egwene, there is nothing you
can do about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; Egwene said bitterly. She did not even
know whether he was ahead of them or behind. Ahead, she suspected;
Mat would have left without any delay. &ldquo;Either way,&rdquo; she muttered
to herself, &ldquo;it does no good. I finally know what one of my dreams
means, and it doesn&rsquo;t help a hemstitch worth!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if you know one meaning,&rdquo; Elayne told her,
&ldquo;perhaps now you will know others. If we sit down and talk them
over, perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <em>Blue Crane</em> gave a shuddering lurch,
throwing Elayne to the deck and Egwene on top of her. When Egwene
struggled to her feet, the shoreline no longer slid by. The vessel
had halted, with the bow raised and the deck canted to one side.
The sails flapped noisily in the wind.</p>

<p>Chin Ellisor pushed himself to his feet and ran for
the bow, leaving the tillerman to rise on his own. &ldquo;You blind worm
of a farmer!&rdquo; he roared toward the man in the bow, who was clinging
to the rail to keep from falling the rest of the way over. &ldquo;You
dirt-grubbing get of a goat! Haven&rsquo;t you been on the river long
enough yet to recognize how the water ruffles over a mudflat?&rdquo; He
seized the man on the rail by the shoulders and pulled him back
onto the deck, but only to shove him out of the way so he could
peer down over the bow himself. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve put a hole in my hull, I
will use your guts for caulking!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other crewmen were clambering to their feet, now,
and more came scrambling up from below. They all ran to cluster
around the captain.</p>

<p>Nynaeve appeared at the head of the ladder that led
down to the passenger cabins, still straightening her skirts. With
a sharp tug at her braid, she frowned at the knot of men in the
bow, then strode to Egwene and Elayne. &ldquo;He ran us onto something,
did he? After all his talk of knowing the river as well as he knows
his wife. The woman probably never receives as much as a smile from
him.&rdquo; She jerked the thick braid again and went forward, pushing
her way through the sailors to reach the captain. They were all
intent on the water below.</p>

<p>There was no point in joining her. <em>He will have
us off faster if he&rsquo;s left to it</em>. Nynaeve was probably telling
him how to do the work. Elayne seemed to feel the same way, from
the rueful shake of head she gave as she watched the captain and
crewmen all turn their attention respectfully from whatever was
under the bow to Nynaeve.</p>

<p>A ripple of agitation ran through the men, and grew
stronger. For a moment the captain&rsquo;s hands could be seen, waving in
protest over the other men&rsquo;s heads, and then Nynaeve was striding
away from them&mdash;they made way, bowing now&mdash;with Ellisor
hurrying beside her and mopping his round face with a large red
handkerchief. His anxious voice became audible as they drew
near.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a good fifteen miles to the next village on
the Andor side, Aes Sedai, and at least five or six miles downriver
on the Cairhien side! Andoran soldiers hold it, it is true, but
they do not hold the miles from here to there!&rdquo; He wiped at his
face as if he were dripping sweat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A sunken ship,&rdquo; Nynaeve told the other two women.
&ldquo;The work of river brigands, the captain thinks. He means to try
backing off it with the sweeps, but he does not seem to think that
will work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were running fast when we hit, Aes Sedai. I
wanted to make good speed for you.&rdquo; Ellisor rubbed even harder at
his face. He was afraid the Aes Sedai would blame him, Egwene
realized. &ldquo;We are stuck hard. But I do not think we are taking
water, Aes Sedai. There is no need to worry. Another ship will be
along. Two sets of sweeps will surely get us free. There is no need
for you to be put ashore, Aes Sedai. I do swear it, by the
Light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were thinking of leaving the ship?&rdquo; Egwene
asked. &ldquo;Do you think that is wise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, it&rsquo;s&mdash;!&rdquo; Nynaeve stopped and frowned
at her. Egwene returned the frown with a level stare. Nynaeve went
on in a calmer tone, if still a tight one. &ldquo;The captain says it may
be an hour before another ship comes along. One with enough sweeps
to make a difference. Or a day. Or two, maybe. I do not think we
can afford to waste a day or two waiting. We can be in this village&mdash;what did you call it, Captain? Jurene?&mdash;we can walk to
Jurene in two hours or less. If Captain Ellisor frees his vessel as
quickly as he hopes, we can reboard then. He says he will stop to
see if we are there. If he does not get free, though, we can take
ship from Jurene. We may even find a vessel waiting. The captain
says traders do stop there, because of the Andoran soldiers.&rdquo; She
drew a deep breath, but her voice grew tighter. &ldquo;Have I explained
my reasoning fully enough? Do you need more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is clear to me,&rdquo; Elayne put in quickly before
Egwene could speak. &ldquo;And it sounds a good idea. You think it is a
good idea, too, don&rsquo;t you, Egwene?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene gave a grudging nod. &ldquo;I suppose it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Ellisor protested, &ldquo;at least go to
the Andor bank. The war, Aes Sedai. Brigands, and every sort of
ruffian, and the soldiers not much better. The very wreck under our
bow shows the sort of men they are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have not seen a living soul on the Cairhien
side,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, &ldquo;and in any case, we are far from defenseless,
Captain. And I will not walk fifteen miles when I can walk
six.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, Aes Sedai.&rdquo; Ellisor really was sweating,
now. &ldquo;I did not mean to suggest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Of course you are not
defenseless, Aes Sedai. I did not mean to suggest it.&rdquo; He wiped his
face furiously, but it still glistened.</p>

<p>Nynaeve opened her mouth, glanced at Egwene, and
seemed to change what she had intended to say. &ldquo;I am going below
for my things,&rdquo; she told the air halfway between Egwene and Elayne,
then turned on Ellisor. &ldquo;Captain, make your rowboat ready.&rdquo; He bowed
and scurried away even before she turned for the hatch, and was
shouting for men to put the boat over the side before she was
below.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If one of you says &lsquo;up,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; Elayne murmured, &ldquo;the
other says &lsquo;down.&rsquo; If you do not stop it, we may not reach
Tear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will reach Tear,&rdquo; Egwene said. &ldquo;And sooner once
Nynaeve realizes she is not the Wisdom any longer. We are all&rdquo;&mdash;she did not say Accepted; there were two many men hurrying
about&mdash;&ldquo;on the same level, now.&rdquo; Elayne sighed.</p>

<p>In short order the rowboat had ferried them ashore,
and they were standing on the bank with walking staffs in hand,
their belongings in bundles on their backs, and hung about them in
pouches and scripts. Rolling grassland and scattered copses
surrounded them, though the hills were forested a few miles in from
the river. The sweeps on the <em>Blue Crane</em> were cutting up
froth, but failing to budge the vessel. Egwene turned and started
south without another glance. And before Nynaeve could take the
lead.</p>

<p>When the others caught up to her, Elayne gave her a
reproving look. Nynaeve walked staring straight ahead. Elayne told
Nynaeve what Egwene had said about Mat and a Gray Man, but the
older woman listened in silence and only said, &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have to look
after himself,&rdquo; without pausing in her stride. After a time, the
Daughter-Heir gave up trying to make the other two talk, and they
all walked in silence.</p>

<p>Clumps of trees close along the riverbank soon hid
the <em>Blue Crane</em>, thick growths of wateroak and willow. They
did not go through the copses, small as they were, for anything at
all might be hiding in the shadows under their branches. A few low
bushes grew scattered between the thickets here close to the river,
but they were too sparse to hide a child, much less a brigand, and
they were widely spaced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we do see brigands,&rdquo; Egwene announced, &ldquo;I am
going to defend myself. There is no Amyrlin looking over our
shoulders here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s mouth thinned. &ldquo;If need be,&rdquo; she told the
air in front of her, &ldquo;we can frighten off any brigands the way we
did those Whitecloaks. If we can find no other way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you would not talk of brigands,&rdquo; Elayne said.
&ldquo;I would like to reach this village without&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A figure in brown and gray rose from behind a bush
standing by itself almost in front of them.</p>
