put an unsteady hand to where the wound had
been in Dailin&rsquo;s middle; when she touched smooth skin, she gasped
as if she had not believed her own eyes.</p>

<p>Nynaeve straightened, drying her hands on her cloak.
Egwene had to admit that good wool did better for a towel than silk
or velvet. &ldquo;I said wash her and get some clothes on her,&rdquo; Nynaeve
snapped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Wise One,&rdquo; Jolien said quickly, and she, Chiad,
and Bain all leaped to obey.</p>

<p>A short laugh burst from Aviendha, a laugh almost at
the edge of tears. &ldquo;I have heard that a Wise One in the Jagged
Spire sept is said to be able to do this, and one in the Four Holes
sept, but I always thought it was boasting.&rdquo; She drew a deep
breath, regaining her composure. &ldquo;Aes Sedai, I owe you a debt. My
water is yours, and the shade of my septhold will welcome you.
Dailin is my second-sister.&rdquo; She saw Nynaeve&rsquo;s uncomprehending look
and added, &ldquo;She is my mother&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s daughter. Close blood, Aes
Sedai. I owe a blood debt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I have any blood to spill,&rdquo; Nynaeve said dryly,
&ldquo;I will spill it myself. If you wish to repay me, tell me if there
is a ship at Jurene. The next village south of here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The village where the soldiers fly the White Lion
banner?&rdquo; Aviendha said. &ldquo;There was a ship there when I scouted
yesterday. The old stories mention ships, but it was strange to see
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light send it is still there.&rdquo; Nynaeve began
putting away her folded papers of powdered herbs. &ldquo;I have done what
I can for the girl, Aviendha, and we must go on. All that she needs
now is food and rest. And try not to let people stick swords in
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What comes, comes, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; the Aiel woman
replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aviendha,&rdquo; Egwene said, &ldquo;feeling as you do about
rivers, how do you cross them? I am sure there is at least one
river nearly as big as the Erinin between here and the Waste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Alguenya,&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;Unless you went around
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have many rivers, but some have things called
bridges where we had need to cross, and others we could wade. For
the rest, Jolien remembered that wood floats.&rdquo; She slapped the
trunk of a tall whitewood. &ldquo;These are big, but they float as well
as a branch. We found dead ones and made ourselves a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ship&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a little ship, of two or three lashed together to cross the big
river.&rdquo; She said it matter-of-factly.</p>

<p>Egwene stared in wonder. If she were as afraid of
something as the Aiel obviously were of rivers, could she make
herself face it the way they did? She did not think so. <em>What
about the Black Ajah</em>, a small voice asked. <em>Have you
stopped being afraid of them? That is different</em>, she told it.
<em>There&rsquo;s no bravery in that. I either hunt them, or else I sit
like a rabbit waiting for a hawk</em>. She quoted the old saying to
herself. &ldquo;<em>It is better to be the hammer than the
nail</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had best be on our way,&rdquo; Nynaeve said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a moment,&rdquo; Elayne told her. &ldquo;Aviendha, why have
you come all this way and put up with such hardship?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha shook her head disgustedly. &ldquo;We have not
come far at all; we were among the last to set out. The Wise Ones
nipped at me like wild dogs circling a calf, saying I had other
duties.&rdquo; Suddenly she grinned, gesturing to the other Aiel. &ldquo;These
stayed back to taunt me in my misery, so they said, but I do not
think the Wise Ones would have let me go if they had not been there
to companion me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We seek the one foretold,&rdquo; Bain said. She was
holding a sleeping Dailin so Chiad could slip a shirt of brown
linen onto her. &ldquo;He Who Comes With the Dawn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will lead us out of the Three-fold Land,&rdquo; Chiad
added. &ldquo;The prophecies say he was born of <em>Far Dareis
Mai</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne looked startled. &ldquo;I thought you said the
Maidens of the Spear were not allowed to have children. I am sure I
was taught that.&rdquo; Bain and Chiad exchanged those looks again, as if
Elayne had come near truth and yet missed it once more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If a Maiden bears a child,&rdquo; Aviendha explained
carefully, &ldquo;she gives the child to the Wise Ones of her sept, and
they pass the child to another woman in such a way that none knows
whose child it is.&rdquo; She, too, sounded as if she were explaining
that stone is hard. &ldquo;Every woman wants to foster such a child in
the hope she may raise He Who Comes With the Dawn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or she may give up the spear and wed the man,&rdquo; Chiad
said, and Bain added, &ldquo;There are sometimes reasons one must give up
the spear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha gave them a level look, but continued as if
they had not spoken. &ldquo;Except that now the Wise Ones say he is to be
found here, beyond the Dragonwall. &lsquo;Blood of our blood mixed with
the old blood, raised by an ancient blood not ours.&rsquo; I do not
understand it, but the Wise Ones spoke in such a way as to leave no
doubts.&rdquo; She paused, obviously choosing her words. &ldquo;You have asked
many questions, Aes Sedai. I wish to ask one. You must understand
that we look for omens and signs. Why do three Aes Sedai walk a
land where the only hand without a knife in it is a hand too weak
with hunger to grasp the hilt? Where do you go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tear,&rdquo; Nynaeve said briskly, &ldquo;unless we stay here
talking until the Heart of the Stone crumbles to dust.&rdquo; Elayne
began adjusting the cord of her bundle and the strap of her script
for walking, and after a moment Egwene did the same.</p>

<p>The Aiel women were looking at one another, Jolien
frozen in the act of closing Dailin&rsquo;s gray-brown coat. &ldquo;Tear?&rdquo;
Aviendha said in a cautious tone. &ldquo;Three Aes Sedai walking through
a troubled land on their way to Tear. This is a strange thing. Why
do you go to Tear, Aes Sedai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene glanced at Nynaeve. <em>Light, a moment ago
they were laughing, and now they&rsquo;re as tense as they ever
were</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We hunt some evil women,&rdquo; Nynaeve said carefully.
&ldquo;Darkfriends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shadowrunners.&rdquo; Jolien twisted her mouth around the
word as if she had bitten into a rotten apple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shadowrunners in Tear,&rdquo; Bain said, and as if part of
the same sentence Chiad added, &ldquo;And three Aes Sedai seeking the
Heart of the Stone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not say we were going to the Heart of the
Stone,&rdquo; Nynaeve said sharply. &ldquo;I merely said I did not want to stay
here till it falls to dust. Egwene, Elayne, are you ready?&rdquo; She started out of
the thicket without waiting for an answer, walking staff thumping
the ground and long strides carrying her south.</p>

<p>Egwene and Elayne made hasty goodbyes before
following after her. The four Aiel on their feet stood watching
them go.</p>

<p>When the two of them were a little way beyond the
trees, Egwene said, &ldquo;My heart almost stopped when you named
yourself. Weren&rsquo;t you afraid they might try to kill you, or to take
you prisoner? The Aiel War was not <em>that</em> long ago, and
whatever they said about not harming women who don&rsquo;t carry spears,
they looked ready enough to use those spears on anything, to
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne shook her head ruefully. &ldquo;I have just learned
how much I do not know about the Aiel, but I was taught that they
do not think of the Aiel War as a war at all. From the way they
behaved toward me, I think maybe that much of what I learned is
truth. Or maybe it was because they think I am Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know they are strange, Elayne, but <em>no</em> one
can call three years of battles anything but a war. I do not care
how much they fight among themselves, a war is a war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not to them. Thousands of Aiel crossed the Spine of
the World, but apparently they saw themselves more like
thief-takers, or headsmen, come after King Laman of Cairhien for
the crime of cutting down <em>Avendoraldera</em>. To the Aiel, it
was not a war; it was an execution.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Avendoraldera</em>, according to one of Verin&rsquo;s
lectures, had been an offshoot of the Tree of Life itself, brought
to Cairhien some four hundred years ago as an unprecedented offer
of peace from the Aiel, given along with the right to cross the
Waste, a right otherwise given to none but peddlers, gleemen, and
the Tuatha&rsquo;an. Much of Cairhien&rsquo;s wealth had been built on the
trade in ivory and perfumes and spices and, most of all, silk, from
the lands beyond the Waste. Not even Verin had any idea of how the
Aiel had come by a sapling of <em>Avendesora</em>&mdash;for one
thing, the old books were clear that it made no seed; for another,
no one knew where the Tree of Life was, except for a few stories
that were clearly wrong, but surely the Tree of Life could have
nothing to do with the Aiel&mdash;or of why the Aiel had called
the Cairhienin the Watersharers, or insisted their trains of
merchant wagons fly a banner bearing the trefoil leaf of <em>
Avendesora</em>.</p>

<p>Egwene supposed, grudgingly, that she could
understand why they had started a war&mdash;even if they did not
think it was one&mdash;after King Laman cut down their gift to
make a throne unlike any other in the world. Laman&rsquo;s Sin, she had
heard it called. According to Verin, not only had Cairhien&rsquo;s trade
across the Waste ended with the war, but those Cairhienin who
ventured into the Waste now vanished. Verin claimed they were said
to be &ldquo;sold as animals&rdquo; in the lands beyond the Waste, but not even
she understood how a man or a woman could be sold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egwene,&rdquo; Elayne said, &ldquo;you know who He Who Comes
With the Dawn must be, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Staring at Nynaeve&rsquo;s back still well ahead of them,
Egwene shook her head&mdash;<em>Does she mean to race us to
Jurene?</em>&mdash;then almost stopped walking. &ldquo;You do not mean&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne nodded. &ldquo;I think so. I do not know much of the
Prophecies of the Dragon, but I have heard a few lines. One I
remember is, &lsquo;On the slopes of Dragonmount shall he be born, born
of a maiden wedded to no man.&rsquo; Egwene, Rand does look like an Aiel.
Well, he looks like the pictures I have seen of Tigraine, too, but
she vanished before he was born, and I hardly think she could have
been his mother anyway. I think Rand&rsquo;s mother was a Maiden of the
Spear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene frowned in thought as she hurried along,
running everything she knew of Rand&rsquo;s birth through her head. He
had been raised by Tam al&rsquo;Thor after Kari al&rsquo;Thor died, but if what
Moiraine said was true, they could not be his real mother and
father. Nynaeve had sometimes seemed to know some secret about
Rand&rsquo;s birth. <em>But I will bet I couldn&rsquo;t pry it out of her with
a fork!</em></p>

<p>They caught up to Nynaeve, Egwene glowering as she
thought, Nynaeve staring straight ahead toward Jurene and that
ship, and Elayne frowning at the pair of them as if they were two
children sulking over who should have the larger piece of cake.</p>

<p>After a time of silent strides, Elayne said, &ldquo;You
handled that very well, Nynaeve. The Healing, and the rest, too. I
do not think they ever doubted you were Aes Sedai. Or that we all
were, because of the way you bore yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did do a good job,&rdquo; Egwene said after a minute.
&ldquo;That was the first time I have ever really watched what is done
during a Healing. It makes making lightning look like mixing
oatcake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A surprised smile appeared on Nynaeve&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Thank
you,&rdquo; she murmured, and reached over to give Egwene&rsquo;s hair a little
tug the way she had when Egwene was a little girl.</p>

<p><em>I am not a little girl any longer</em>. The
moment passed as quickly as it had come, and they went on in
silence once more. Elayne sighed loudly.</p>

<p>They covered another mile, or a little more, swiftly,
despite swinging in from the river to go around the thickets along
the bank. Nynaeve insisted on staying well clear of the trees.
Egwene thought it was silly to think more Aiel would be hiding in
the copses, but the swing inland did not add much distance to what
they had to cover; none of the growths were very big.</p>

<p>Elayne watched the trees, though, and she was the one
who suddenly screamed, &ldquo;Look out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene jerked her head around; men were stepping out
from among the trees, slings whirling &rsquo;round their heads. She
reached for <em>saidar</em>, and something struck her head, and
darkness drank everything.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Egwene could feel herself swaying, feel something
moving under her. Her head seemed to be nothing but pain. She tried
to raise a hand to her temples, but something dug into her wrists,
and her hands did not move.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;better than lying there all day waiting for
dark,&rdquo; a man&rsquo;s rough voice said. &ldquo;Who knows if another ship would
come by close in? And I don&rsquo;t trust that boat. It leaks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do better hope Adden does believe you did see
those rings before you did decide,&rdquo; another man said. &ldquo;He does want
fat cargoes, not women, I think.&rdquo; the first man muttered something
coarse about what Adden could do with his leaky boat, and the
cargoes, too.</p>

<p>Her eyes opened. Silver-flecked spots danced across
her vision; she thought she might be going to throw up on the
ground swaying past under her head. She was tied across the back of
a horse, her wrists and ankles joined by a rope running under its
belly, her hair hanging down.</p>

<p>It was still daylight. She craned her neck to look
around. So many rough-dressed men on horses surrounded her that she
could not see whether Nynaeve and Elayne had been captured, as
well. Some of the men wore bits of armor&mdash;a battered helmet, or a
dented breastplate, or a jerkin sewn all over with metal scales&mdash;but
most wore only coats that had not been cleaned in months, if ever.
From the smell, the men had not cleaned themselves in months,
either. They all wore swords, at their waists or on their
backs.</p>

<p>Rage hit her, and fear, but most of all white-hot
anger. <em>I won&rsquo;t be a prisoner. I won&rsquo;t be bound! I won&rsquo;t!</em>
She reached for <em>saidar</em> and the pain nearly lifted the top
of her head; she barely stifled a moan.</p>

<p>The horse paused for a moment of shouts and the creak
of rusty hinges, then went ahead a little further, and the men
began to dismount. As they moved apart, she could see something of
where they were. A log palisade surrounded them, built atop a
large, round earthen mound, and men with bows stood guard on a
wooden walk built just high enough for them to see over the
rough-hewn ends of the logs. One low, windowless log house seemed
to be built into the mounded dirt under the wall. There was no
other structure beyond a few lean-to sheds. Aside from the men and
horses that had just entered, the rest of the open space was filled
with cook fires, and tethered horses, and more unwashed men. There
must have been at least a hundred. Caged goats and pigs and
chickens filled the air with squeals and grunts and clucks that
blended with coarse shouts and laughter to make a din that pierced
her head.</p>

<p>Her eyes found Nynaeve and Elayne, bound head down
across saddleless horses as she was. Neither seemed to be stirring;
the very end of Nynaeve&rsquo;s braid dragged across the dirt as her
horse stirred. A small hope faded; that one of them might be free,
to help whoever was held escape. <em>Light, I cannot stand to be a
prisoner again. Not again</em>. Gingerly, she tried reaching for
<em>saidar</em> again. The pain was not so bad this time&mdash;merely as if someone had dropped a rock on her head&mdash;but it
shattered the emptiness before she could even think of a rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of them&rsquo;s awake!&rdquo; a man&rsquo;s panicked voice
shouted.</p>

<p>Egwene tried to hang limp and look unthreatening.
<em>How in the Light could I look threatening tied up like a sack
of meal! Burn me, I have to buy time. I have to!</em> &ldquo;I will not
harm you,&rdquo; she told the sweaty-faced fellow who came running toward
her. Or she tried to tell him. She was not sure how much she had
actually said before something crashed into her head again and
darkness rolled over her in a wave of nausea.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Waking was easier the next time. Her head still hurt,
but not as much as it had, though her thoughts did seem to spin
dizzily. <em>At least my stomach isn&rsquo;t</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Light, I&rsquo;d
better not think of that</em>. There was a taste of sour wine and
something bitter in her mouth. Strips of lamplight showed through
horizontal cracks in a crudely made wall, but she lay in darkness,
on her back. On dirt, she thought. The door did not seem to fit
well either, but it looked all too sturdy.</p>

<p>She pushed herself to her hands and knees, and was
surprised to find she was not tied in any way. Except for that one
wall of unpeeled logs, the others all seemed to be of rough stone.
The light through the cracks was enough to show her Nynaeve and
Elayne lying sprawled on the dirt. There was blood on the
Daughter-Heir&rsquo;s face. Neither of them moved except for the rise and
fall of their chests as they breathed. Egwene hesitated between
trying to wake them immediately and seeing what lay on the other
side of that wall. <em>Just a peek</em>, she told herself. <em>I
might as well see what we have guarding us before I wake
them</em>.</p>

<p>She told herself it was not because she was afraid
she might be unable to waken them. As she put her eye to one of the
cracks near the door, she thought of the blood on Elayne&rsquo;s face and
tried to remember exactly what it was Nynaeve had done for
Dailin.</p>

<p>The next room was large&mdash;it had to be all the
rest of the log building she had seen&mdash;and windowless, but
brightly lit with gold and silver lamps hanging from spikes driven
into the walls and the logs that made the high ceiling. There was
no fireplace. On the packed dirt floor farm-house tables and chairs
mingled with chests covered in gilt-work and inlaid with ivory. A
carpet woven in peacocks lay beside a huge canopied bed, piled deep
with filthy blankets and comforters, with elaborately carved and
gilded posts.</p>

<p>A dozen men stood or sat around the room, but all
eyes were on one large, fair-haired man who might have been
handsome if his face were cleaner. He stood staring down at the top
of a table with fluted legs and gilded scrollwork, one hand on his
sword hilt, a finger of the other pushing something she could not
make out in small circles on the tabletop.</p>

<p>The outer door opened, revealing night outside, and a
lanky man with his left ear gone came in. &ldquo;He has no come, yet,&rdquo; he
said roughly. He was missing two fingers on his left hand, too. &ldquo;I
do no like dealing with that kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The big, fair-haired man paid him no mind, only kept
moving whatever it was on the table. &ldquo;Three Aes Sedai,&rdquo; he
murmured, then laughed. &ldquo;Good prices for Aes Sedai, if you have the
belly to deal with the right buyer. If you&rsquo;re ready to risk having
your belly ripped out through your mouth should you try selling him
a pig in a sack. Not so safe as slitting the crew&rsquo;s throats on a
trader&rsquo;s ship, eh, Coke? Not so easy, wouldn&rsquo;t you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a nervous stir among the other men, and the
one addressed, a stocky fellow with shifty eyes, leaned forward
anxiously. &ldquo;They <em>are</em> Aes Sedai, Adden.&rdquo; She recognized
that voice; the man who had made the coarse suggestions. &ldquo;They must
be, Adden. The rings prove it, I tell you!&rdquo; Adden picked up
something from the table, a small circle that glinted gold in the
lamplight.</p>

<p>Egwene gasped and felt at her fingers. <em>They took
my ring!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;I do no like it,&rdquo; muttered the lanky man with the
missing ear. &ldquo;Aes Sedai. Any one of them could kill us all. Fortune
prick me! You do be a stone-carved fool, Coke, and I ought to carve
your throat. What if one of them do wake before he does come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll not wake for hours.&rdquo; That was a fat man with
hoarse voice and a gap-toothed sneer. &ldquo;My granny taught me of that
stuff we fed them. They&rsquo;ll sleep till sunrise, and he&rsquo;ll come long
afore then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene worked her mouth around the sour wine taste
and the bitterness. <em>Whatever it was, your granny lied to you.
She should have strangled you in your cradle!</em> Before this &ldquo;he&rdquo;
came, this man who thought he could buy Aes Sedai&mdash;<em>like a
bloody Seanchan!</em>&mdash;she would have Nynaeve and Elayne on
their feet. She crawled to Nynaeve.</p>

<p>As near as she could tell, Nynaeve seemed to be
sleeping, so she began with the simple expedient of shaking her. To
her surprise, Nynaeve&rsquo;s eyes shot open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She got a hand over Nynaeve&rsquo;s mouth in time to stop
the word. &ldquo;We are being held prisoner,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;There are a
dozen men on the other side of that wall, and more outside. A great
many more. They gave us something to make us sleep, but it wasn&rsquo;t
very successful. Do you remember, yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve pulled Egwene&rsquo;s hand aside. &ldquo;I remember.&rdquo; Her
voice was soft and grim. She grimaced and twisted her mouth, then
suddenly barked a nearly silent laugh. &ldquo;Sleepwell root. The fools
gave us sleepwell root mixed in wine. Wine near gone to vinegar, it
tastes like. Quick, do you remember anything of what I taught you?
What does sleepwell root do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It clears headaches so you can sleep,&rdquo; Egwene said
just as softly. And nearly as grimly, until she heard what she was
saying. &ldquo;It makes you a little drowsy, but that is all.&rdquo; The fat
man had not listened well to what his granny told him. &ldquo;All they
did was help clear the pain of being hit in the head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. &ldquo;And once we wake Elayne,
we&rsquo;ll give them a thanking they won&rsquo;t forget.&rdquo; She rose, only to
crouch beside the golden-haired woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I saw more than a hundred of them outside
when they brought us in,&rdquo; Egwene whispered to Nynaeve&rsquo;s back. &ldquo;I am
sure you won&rsquo;t mind if I use the Power as a weapon this time. And
someone is apparently coming to <em>buy</em> us. I mean to do
something to that fellow that will make him walk in the Light till
the day he dies!&rdquo; Nynaeve was still crouched over Elayne, but
neither of them was moving. &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is hurt badly, Egwene. I think her skull is
broken, and she is barely breathing. Egwene, she is dying as surely
as Dailin was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you do something?&rdquo; Egwene tried to remember
all the flows Nynaeve had woven to Heal the Aiel woman, but she
could recall no more than every third thread. &ldquo;You have to!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They took my herbs,&rdquo; Nynaeve muttered fiercely, her
voice trembling. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t! Not without the herbs!&rdquo; Egwene was
shocked to realize Nynaeve was on the point of tears. &ldquo;Burn them
all, I can&rsquo;t do it without&mdash;!&rdquo; Suddenly she seized Elayne&rsquo;s
shoulders as if she meant to lift the unconscious woman and shake
her. &ldquo;Burn you, girl,&rdquo; she rasped, &ldquo;I did not bring you all this
way to die! I should have left you scrubbing pots! I should have
tied you up in a sack for Mat to carry to your mother! I will not
let you die on me! Do you hear me? I won&rsquo;t allow it!&rdquo; <em>
Saidar</em> suddenly shone around her, and Elayne&rsquo;s eyes and mouth
opened wide together.</p>

<p>Egwene got her hands over Elayne&rsquo;s mouth just in time
to muffle any sound, she thought, but as she touched her, the
eddies of Nynaeve&rsquo;s Healing caught her like a straw on the edge of
a whirlpool. Cold froze her to the bone, meeting heat that seared
outward as if it meant to crisp her flesh; the world vanished in a
sensation of rushing, falling, flying, spinning.</p>

<p>When it finally ended, she was breathing hard and
staring down at Elayne, who stared back over the hands she still
had pressed over her woman&rsquo;s mouth. The last of Egwene&rsquo;s headache
was gone. Even the backwash of what Nynaeve had done had apparently
been enough for that. The murmur of voices from the other room was
no louder; if Elayne had made any noise&mdash;or if she had&mdash;Adden and the others had not noticed.</p>

<p>Nynaeve was on her hands and knees, head down and
shaking. &ldquo;Light!&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;Doing it that way&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;was like
peeling off&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;my own skin. Oh, Light!&rdquo; She peered at Elayne.
&ldquo;How do you feel, girl?&rdquo; Egwene pulled her hands away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tired,&rdquo; Elayne murmured. &ldquo;And hungry. Where are we?
There were some men with slings&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hastily Egwene told her what had happened. Elayne&rsquo;s
face began to darken a long way before she was done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; Nynaeve added in a voice like iron, &ldquo;we
are going to show these louts what it means to meddle with us.&rdquo;
<em>Saidar</em> shone around her once more.</p>

<p>Elayne was unsteady getting to her feet, but the glow
surrounded her, as well. Egwene reached out to the True Source
almost gleefully.</p>

<p>When they looked through the cracks again, to see
exactly what they had to deal with, there were three Myrddraal in
the room.</p>

<p>Dead-black garb hanging unnaturally still, they stood
by the table, and every man but Adden had moved as far from them as
he could, till they all had their backs against the walls and their
eyes on the dirt floor. Across the table from the Myrddraal, Adden
faced those eyeless stares, but sweat made runnels in the dirt on
his face.</p>

<p>The Fade picked up a ring from the table. Egwene saw
now that it was a much heavier circle of gold than the Great
Serpent rings.</p>

<p>Face pressed against the crack between two logs,
Nynaeve gasped softly and fumbled at the neck of her dress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three <em>Aes Sedai</em>,&rdquo; the Halfman hissed, its
amusement sounding like dead things powdering to dust, &ldquo;and one
carried this.&rdquo; The ring made a heavy thud as the Myrddraal tossed
it back on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are the ones I seek,&rdquo; another of them rasped.
&ldquo;You will be well rewarded, human.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must take them by surprise,&rdquo; Nynaeve said softly.
&ldquo;What kind of lock holds this door?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene could just see the lock on the outside of the
door, an iron thing on a chain heavy enough to hold an enraged
bull. &ldquo;Be ready,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>She thinned one flow of Earth to finer than a hair,
hoping the Halfmen could not sense so small a channeling, and wove
it into the iron chain, into the tiniest bits of it.</p>

<p>One of the Myrddraal lifted its head. Another leaned
across the table toward Adden. &ldquo;I itch, human. Are you sure they
sleep?&rdquo; Adden swallowed hard and nodded his head.</p>

<p>The third Myrddraal turned to stare at the door to
the room where Egwene and the others crouched.</p>

<p>The chain fell to the floor, the Myrddraal staring at
it snarled, and the outer door swung open, black-veiled death
flowing in from the night.</p>

<p>The room erupted in screams and shouts as men clawed
for their swords to fight stabbing Aiel spears. The Myrddraal drew
blades blacker than their garb and fought for their lives, too.
Egwene had once seen six cats all fighting each other; this was
that a hundredfold. And yet in seconds, silence reigned. Or almost
silence.</p>

<p>Every human not wearing a black veil lay dead with a
spear through him; one pinned Adden to the wall. Two Aiel lay
still, as well, amid the jumble of overturned furniture and dead.
The three Myrddraal stood back-to-back in the center of the room,
black swords in their hands. One was clutching his side as if
wounded, though he gave no other sign of it. Another had a long
gash down its pale face; it did not bleed. Around them circled the
five veiled Aiel still alive, crouching. From outside came screams
and clashes of metal that said more Aiel still fought in the night,
but in the room was a softer sound.</p>

<p>As they circled, the Aiel drummed their spears
against their small hide bucklers. <em>Thrum-thrum-THRUM-thrum</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>thrum-thrum-THRUM-thrum</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>
thrum-thrum-THRUM-thrum</em>. The Myrddraal turned with them, and
their eyeless faces seemed uncertain, uneasy that the fear their
gaze struck into every human heart did not seem to touch these.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dance with me, Shadowman,&rdquo; one of the Aiel called
suddenly, tauntingly. He sounded like a young man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dance with me, Eyeless.&rdquo; That was a woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dance with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dance with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, straightening, &ldquo;that it is
time.&rdquo; She threw open the door, and the three women wrapped in the
glow of <em>saidar</em> stepped out.</p>

<p>It seemed as though, for the Myrddraal, the Aiel had
ceased to exist, and for the Aiel, the Myrddraal. The Aiel stared
at Egwene and the others above their veils as if not quite sure
what they were seeing; she heard one of the women gasp loudly. The
Myrddraal&rsquo;s eyeless stare was different. Egwene could almost feel
the Halfmen&rsquo;s knowledge of their own deaths in it; Halfmen knew
women embracing the True Source when they saw them. She was sure
she could feel a desire for her death, too, if theirs could buy
hers, and an even stronger desire to strip the soul out of her
flesh and make both playthings for the Shadow, a desire to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She had just stepped into the room, yet it seemed she
had been meeting that stare for hours. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take no more of this,&rdquo;
she growled, and unleashed a flow of Fire.</p>

<p>Flames burst out of all three Myrddraal, sprouting in
every direction, and they shrieked like splintered bones jamming a
meatgrinder. Yet she had forgotten she was not alone, that Elayne
and Nynaeve were with her. Even as the flames consumed the Halfmen,
the very air seemed suddenly to push them together in midair,
crushing them into a ball of fire and blackness that grew smaller
and smaller. Their screams dug at Egwene&rsquo;s spine, and something
shot out from Nynaeve&rsquo;s hands&mdash;a thin bar of white light that
made noonday sun seem dark, a bar of fire that made molten metal
seem cold, connecting her hands to the Myrddraal. And they ceased
to exist as if they had never been. Nynaeve gave a startled jump,
and the glow around her vanished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;what was that?&rdquo; Elayne asked.</p>

<p>Nynaeve shook her head; she looked as stunned as
Elayne sounded. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I was so angry, so afraid,
at what they wanted to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I do not know what it was.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Balefire</em>, Egwene thought. She did not know
how she knew, but she was certain of it. Reluctantly, she made
herself release <em>saidar</em>; made it release her. She did not
know which was harder. <em>And I did not see a thing of what she
did!</em></p>

<p>The Aiel unveiled themselves, then. A trifle hastily,
Egwene thought, as if to tell her and the other two they were no
longer ready to fight. Three of the Aiel were male, one an older
man with more than touches of gray in his dark red hair. They were
tall, these Aielmen, and young or old, they had that calm sureness
in their eyes, that dangerous grace of motion Egwene associated
with Warders; death rode on their shoulders, and they knew it was
there and were not afraid. One of the women was Aviendha. The
screams and shouts outside were dying away.</p>

<p>Nynaeve started toward the fallen Aiel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no need, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; the older man said.
&ldquo;They took Shadowman steel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve still bent to check each, pulling their veils
away so she could peel back eyelids and feel throats for a pulse.
When she straightened from the second, her face was white. It was
Dailin. &ldquo;Burn you! Burn you!&rdquo; It was not clear whether she meant
Dailin, or the man with gray in his hair, or Aviendha, or all Aiel.
&ldquo;I did not Heal her so she could die like this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Death comes to us all,&rdquo; Aviendha began, but when
Nynaeve rounded on her, she fell silent. The Aiel exchanged
glances, as if not certain whether Nynaeve might do to them what
had been done to the Myrddraal. It was not fear in their eyes, only
awareness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shadowman steel kills,&rdquo; Aviendha said, &ldquo;it does not
wound.&rdquo; The older man looked at her, a slight surprise in his eyes&mdash;Egwene decided that, like Lan, for this man that flicker of
the eyelids was the equivalent of another man&rsquo;s open astonishment&mdash;and Aviendha said, &ldquo;They know little of some things,
Rhuarc.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; Elayne said in a clear voice, &ldquo;that we
interrupted your&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;dance. Perhaps we should not have
interfered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene gave her a startled look, then saw what she
was doing. <em>Put them at ease, and give Nynaeve a chance to cool
down</em>. &ldquo;You were handling things quite well,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Perhaps we offended by putting our noses in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The graying man&mdash;Rhuarc&mdash;gave a deep
chuckle. &ldquo;Aes Sedai, I for one am glad of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;whatever it was you
did.&rdquo; For a moment he looked not entirely sure of that, but in the
next he had his good temper back. He had a good smile, and a
strong, square face; he was handsome, if a little old. &ldquo;We could
have killed them, but three Shadowmen&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;They would have killed
two or three of us, certainly, perhaps all, and I cannot say we
would have finished them all. For the young, death is an enemy they
wish to try their strength against. For those of us a little older,
she is an old friend, an old lover, but one we are not eager to
meet again soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve seemed to relax with his speech, as if
meeting an Aiel who did not seem anxious to die had leached the
tension out of her. &ldquo;I should thank you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I do. I
will admit I am surprised to see you, though. Aviendha, did you
expect to find us here? How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I followed you.&rdquo; The Aiel woman seemed
unembarrassed. &ldquo;To see what you would do. I saw the men take you,
but I was too far back to help. I was sure you must see me if I
came too close, so I stayed a hundred paces behind. By the time I
saw you could not help yourselves, it was too late to try
alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure you did what you could,&rdquo; Egwene said
faintly. <em>She was just a hundred paces behind us? Light, the
brigands never saw anything</em>.</p>

<p>Aviendha took her words as urging to tell more. &ldquo;I
knew where Corarn must be, and he knew where Dhael and Luaine were,
and they knew&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She paused, frowning at the older man. &ldquo;I did
not expect to find any clan chief, much less my own, among those
who came. Who leads the Taardad Aiel, Rhuarc, with you here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rhuarc shrugged as if it were of no account. &ldquo;The
sept chiefs will take their turns, and try to decide if they truly
wish to go Rhuidean when I die. I would not have come, except that
Amys and Bair and Melaine and Seana stalked me like ridgecats after
a wild goat. The dreams said I must go. They asked if I truly
wanted to die old and fat in a bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha laughed as if at a great joke. &ldquo;I have heard
it said that a man caught between his wife and a Wise One often
wishes for a dozen old enemies to fight instead. A man caught
between a wife and three Wise Ones, and the wife a Wise One
herself, must consider trying to slay Sightblinder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The thought came to me.&rdquo; He frowned down at
something on the floor; three Great Serpent rings, Egwene saw, and
a much heavier golden ring made for a man&rsquo;s large finger. &ldquo;It still
does. All things must change, but I would not be a part of that
change if I could set myself aside from it. Three Aes Sedai,
traveling to Tear.&rdquo; The other Aiel glanced at one another as if
they did not want Egwene and her companions to notice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You spoke of dreams,&rdquo; Egwene said. &ldquo;Do your Wise
Ones know what their dreams mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some do. If you would know more than that, you must
speak to them. Perhaps they will tell an Aes Sedai. They do not
tell men, except what the dreams say we must do.&rdquo; He sounded tired,
suddenly. &ldquo;And that is usually what we would avoid, if we
could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stooped to pick up the man&rsquo;s ring. On it, a crane
flew above a lance and crown; Egwene knew it now. She had seen it
often before, dangling about Nynaeve&rsquo;s neck on a leather cord.
Nynaeve stepped on the other rings to snatch it out of his hand;
her face was flushed, with anger and too many other emotions for
Egwene to read. Rhuarc made no move to take it back, but went on in
the same weary tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And one of them carries a ring I have heard of as a
boy. The ring of Malkieri kings. They rode with the Shienarans
against the Aiel in my father&rsquo;s time. They were good in the dance
of the spears. But Malkier fell to the Blight. It is said only a
child king survived, and he courts the death that took his land as
other men court beautiful women. Truly, this is a strange thing,
Aes Sedai. Of all the strange sights I thought I might see when
Melaine harried me out of my own hold and over the Dragonwall, none
has been so strange as this. The path you set me is one I never
thought my feet would follow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I set no paths for you,&rdquo; Nynaeve said sharply. &ldquo;All
I want is to continue my journey. These men had horses. We will
take three of them and be on our way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the night, Aes Sedai?&rdquo; Rhuarc said. &ldquo;Is your
journey so urgent that you would travel these dangerous lands in
the dark?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve struggled visibly before saying, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; In a
firmer tone she added, &ldquo;But I mean to leave with the sunrise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aiel carried the dead outside the palisade, but
neither Egwene nor her companions wanted to use the filthy bed
Adden had slept in. They picked up their rings and slept under the
sky in their cloaks and the blankets the Aiel gave them.</p>

<p>When dawn pearled the sky to the east, the Aiel
produced a breakfast of tough, dried meat&mdash;Egwene hesitated
over that until Aviendha told her it was goat&mdash;flatbread that
was almost as difficult to chew as the stringy meat, and a
blue-veined white cheese that had a tart taste and was hard enough
to make Elayne murmur that the Aiel must practice by chewing rocks.
But the Daughter-Heir ate as much as Egwene and Nynaeve together.
The Aiel turned the horses loose&mdash;they did not ride unless
they had to, Aviendha explained, sounding as if she herself would
as soon run on blistered feet&mdash;after choosing out the three
best for Egwene and the others. They were all tall and nearly as
big as warhorses, with proud necks and fierce eyes. A black
stallion for Nynaeve, a roan mare for Elayne, and a gray mare for
Egwene.</p>

<p>She chose to call the gray Mist, in the hope that a
gentle name might soothe her, and indeed, Mist did seem to step
lightly as they rode south, just as the sun lifted a red rim above
the horizon.</p>

<p>The Aiel accompanied them afoot, all those who had
survived the fight. Three more had died aside from the two the
Myrddraal killed. They were nineteen, altogether, now. They loped
along easily alongside the horses. At first, Egwene tried holding
Mist to a slow walk, but the Aiel thought this very funny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will race you ten miles,&rdquo; Aviendha said, &ldquo;and we
shall see who wins, your horse or I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will race you twenty!&rdquo; Rhuarc called,
laughing.</p>

<p>Egwene thought they might actually be serious, and
when she and the others let their horses walk at a quicker pace,
the Aiel certainly showed no sign of falling back.</p>

<p>When the thatched rooftops of Jurene came in sight,
Rhuarc said, &ldquo;Fare you well, Aes Sedai. May you always find water
and shade. Perhaps we will meet again before the change comes.&rdquo; He
sounded grim. As the Aiel curved away to the south, Aviendha and
Chiad and Bain each raised a hand in farewell. They did not seem to
be slowing down now that they no longer ran with the horses; if
anything, they ran a little faster. Egwene had a suspicion they
meant to maintain that pace until they reached wherever it was they
were going.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did he mean by that?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;Perhaps we
will meet again before the change&rsquo;?&rdquo; Elayne shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does not matter what he meant,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. &ldquo;I
am just as glad they came last night, but I am glad to have them
gone, too. I hope there is a ship here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jurene itself was a small place, all wooden houses
and none more than a single story, but the White Lion banner of
Andor flew over it on a tall staff, and fifty of the Queen&rsquo;s Guards
held it, in red coats with long white collars beneath shining
breastplates. They had been placed there, their captain said, to
make a safe haven for refugees who wished to flee to Andor, but
fewer such came every day. Most went to villages further downriver,
now, nearer Aringill. It was a good thing the three women had come
when they did, as he expected to receive orders returning his
company to Andor any day. The few inhabitants of Jurene would
likely go with them, leaving what remained for brigands and the
Cairhienin soldiers of warring Houses.</p>

<p>Elayne kept her face hidden in the hood of her sturdy
wool cloak, but none of the soldiers seemed to associate the girl
with red-gold hair with their Daughter-Heir. Some asked her to
stay; Egwene was not sure whether Elayne was pleased or shocked.
She herself told the men who asked her that she had no time for
them. It was nice, in an odd way, to be asked; she certainly had no
wish to kiss any of these fellows, but it was pleasant to be
reminded that some men, at least, thought she was as pretty as
Elayne. Nynaeve slapped one man&rsquo;s face. That almost made Egwene
laugh, and Elayne smiled openly; Egwene thought Nynaeve had been
pinched, and despite the glare on her face, she did not look
entirely displeased, either.</p>

<p>They were not wearing their rings. It had not taken
much effort on Nynaeve&rsquo;s part to convince them that one place they
did not want to be taken for Aes Sedai was Tear, especially if the
Black Ajah was there. Egwene had hers in her pouch with the stone
<em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>; she touched it often to remind herself they
were still there. Nynaeve wore hers on the cord that held Lan&rsquo;s
heavy ring between her breasts.</p>

<p>There was a ship in Jurene, tied to the single stone
dock sticking into the Erinin. Not the ship Aviendha had seen, it
seemed, but still a ship. Egwene was dismayed when she saw it.
Twice as wide as the <em>Blue Crane</em>, the <em>Darter</em>
belied its name with a bluff bow as round as its captain.</p>

<p>That worthy fellow blinked at Nynaeve and scratched
his ear when she asked if his vessel was fast. &ldquo;Fast? I am full of
fancy wood from Shienar and rugs from Kandor. What need to be fast
with a cargo like that? Prices only go up. Yes, I suppose there are
faster ships behind me, but they&rsquo;ll not put in here. I would not
have stopped myself if I hadn&rsquo;t found worms in the meat. Fool
notion that they&rsquo;d have meat to sell in Cairhien. The <em>Blue
Crane</em>? Aye, I saw Ellisor hung up on something upriver this
morning. He&rsquo;ll not get off soon, I&rsquo;m thinking. That&rsquo;s what a fast
ship brings you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynave paid their fares&mdash;and twice as much
again for the horses&mdash;with such a look on her face that
neither Egwene nor Elayne spoke to her until long after the <em>
Darter</em> had wallowed away from Jurene.</p>
