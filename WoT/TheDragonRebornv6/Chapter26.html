<h4><em>Behind a Lock</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">S</span>haking
her head, Egwene walked back to the doors she
had dismissed. <em>She had to go somewhere</em>. Inside the first,
the few furnishings were shapeless mounds under dusty cloths, and
the air seemed stale, as if the door had not been opened in some
time. She grimaced; there were mouse tracks in the dust on
the floor. But no others. Two more doors, opened hastily, showed
the same thing. It was no surprise. There were many more empty
rooms than occupied in the Accepted&rsquo;s galleries.</p>

<p>When she pulled her head out of the third room,
Nynaeve and Elayne were coming down the ramp behind her with no
particular haste.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she hiding?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked in surprise. &ldquo;In
there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I lost her.&rdquo; Egwene peered both ways along the
curving gallery again. <em>Where did she go?</em> She did not mean
Else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I had thought Else could outrun you,&rdquo; Elayne said
with a smile, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have chased her, too, but she has always looked
too plump for running to me.&rdquo; Her smile was worried, though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will have to find her later,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, &ldquo;and
make sure she knows to keep her mouth shut. How could the Amyrlin
trust that girl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I was right on top of her,&rdquo; Egwene said
slowly, &ldquo;but it was someone else. Nynaeve, I turned my back for a
moment, and she was gone. Not Else&mdash;I never even saw her!&mdash;the woman I thought was Else at first. She was just&mdash;gone, and I don&rsquo;t know where.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s breath caught. &ldquo;One of the Soulless?&rdquo; She
looked around hastily, but the gallery was still empty except for
the three of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not her,&rdquo; Egwene said firmly. &ldquo;She&mdash;&rdquo; <em>I am
not going to tell them she made me feel six years old, with a torn
dress, a dirty face, and a runny nose</em>. &ldquo;She was no Gray Man.
She was tall and striking, with black eyes and black hair. You&rsquo;d
notice her in a crowd of a thousand. I have never seen her before,
but I think she is Aes Sedai. She must be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve waited, as though for more, then said
impatiently, &ldquo;If you see her again, point her out to me. If you
think there&rsquo;s cause. We&rsquo;ve no time to stand here talking. I mean to
see what is in that storeroom before Else has a chance to tell the
wrong person about it. Maybe they were careless. Let&rsquo;s not give
them a chance to correct it, if they were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she fell in beside Nynaeve, with Elayne on the
other side, Egwene realized she still had the stone ring&mdash;Corianin Nedeal&rsquo;s <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>&mdash;clutched in her fist.
Reluctantly, she tucked it into her pouch and pulled the
drawstrings tight. <em>As long as I don&rsquo;t go to sleep with the
bloody</em>&mdash;<em>But that&rsquo;s what I am planning, isn&rsquo;t
it?</em></p>

<p>But that was for tonight, and no use worrying about
it now. As they made their way through the Tower, she kept an eye
out for the woman in silver and white. She was not sure why she was
relieved not to see her. <em>I am a grown woman, and quite capable,
thank you</em>. Still, she was just as glad that no one they
encountered looked even remotely like her. The more she thought of
the woman, the more she felt there was something&mdash;wrong&mdash;about her. <em>Light, I am starting to see the Black Ajah
under my bed. Only, maybe they</em> are <em>under the bed</em>.</p>

<p>The library stood a little apart from the tall, thick
shaft of the White Tower proper, its pale stone heavily streaked
with blue, and it looked much like crashing waves frozen at their
climax. Those waves loomed as large as a palace in the morning
light, and Egwene knew they certainly contained as many rooms as
one, but all those rooms&mdash;those below the odd corridors in
the upper levels, where Verin had her chambers&mdash;were filled
with shelves, and the shelves filled with books, manuscripts,
papers, scrolls, maps, and charts, collected from every nation over
the course of three thousand years. Not even the great libraries in
Tear and Cairhien held so many.</p>

<p>The librarians&mdash;Brown sisters all&mdash;guarded those shelves, and guarded the doors as closely, to make
sure not a scrap of paper left unless they knew who took it and
why. But it was not to one of the guarded entrances that Nynaeve
led Egwene and Elayne.</p>

<p>Around the foundations of the library, lying flat to
the ground in the shade of tall pecan trees, were other doors, both
large and small. Laborers sometimes needed access to the storerooms
beneath, and the librarians did not approve of sweating men
tracking through their preserve. Nynaeve pulled up one of those, no
bigger than the front door of a farmhouse, and motioned the others
down a steep flight of stairs descending into darkness. When she
let it down behind them, all light vanished.</p>

<p>Egwene opened herself to <em>saidar</em>&mdash;it
came so smoothly that she barely realized what she was doing&mdash;and channeled a trickle of the Power that flooded through her. For
a moment the mere feel of that rush surging within her threatened
to overwhelm other sensations. A small ball of bluish-white light
appeared, balanced in the air above her hand. She took a deep
breath and reminded herself of why she was walking stiffly. It was
a link to the rest of the world. The feel of her linen shift
against her skin returned, of woolen stockings, and her dress. With
a small pang of regret, she banished the desire to pull in more, to
let <em>saidar</em> absorb her.</p>

<p>Elayne made a glowing sphere for herself at the same
time, and the pair provided more light than two lanterns would
have. &ldquo;It feels so&mdash;wonderful, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she murmured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; Egwene said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo; Elayne sighed. &ldquo;It just feels&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I will be
careful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This way,&rdquo; Nynaeve told them sharply and brushed by
to lead them down. She did not go too far ahead. She was not angry,
and had to use the light the other two provided.</p>

<p>The dusty side corridor by which they had entered,
lined with wooden doors set in gray stone walls, took nearly a
hundred paces to reach the much wider main hall that ran the length
of the library. Their lights showed footprints overlaying
footprints in the dust, most from the large boots men would wear
and most themselves faded by dust. The ceiling was higher here, and
some of the doors nearly large enough for a barn. The main stairs
at the end, half the width of the hall, were where large things
were brought down. Another flight beside them led deeper. Nynaeve
took it without a pause.</p>

<p>Egwene followed quickly. The bluish light washed out
Elayne&rsquo;s face, but Egwene thought it still looked paler than it
should. <em>We could scream our lungs out down here, and no one
would hear a whimper</em>.</p>

<p>She felt a lightning bolt form, or the potential for
one, and nearly stumbled. She had never before channeled two flows
at once; it did not seem difficult at all.</p>

<p>The main hall of the second basement was much like
the first level, wide and dusty but with a lower ceiling. Nynaeve
hurried to the third door on the right and stopped.</p>

<p>The door was not large, but its rough wooden planks
somehow gave an impression of thickness. A round iron lock hung
from a length of stout chain that was drawn tight through two thick
staples, one in the door, the other cemented into the wall. Lock
and chain alike had the look of newness; there was almost no dust
on them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lock!&rdquo; Nynaeve jerked at it; the chain had no
give, and neither did the lock. &ldquo;Did either of you see a lock
anywhere else?&rdquo; She pulled it again, then flung it against the door
hard enough to bounce. The bang echoed down the hall. &ldquo;I did not
see one other locked door!&rdquo; She pounded a fist on the rough wood.
&ldquo;Not one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Calm yourself,&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;There is no need to
throw a tantrum. I could open the lock myself, if I could see how
the inside of it works. We will open it some way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not want to calm myself,&rdquo; Nynaeve snapped. &ldquo;I
want to be furious! I want&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letting the rest of the tirade fade from her
awareness, Egwene touched the chain. She had learned more things
than how to make lightning bolts since leaving Tar Valon. One was
an affinity for metal. That came from Earth, one of the Five Powers
few women had much strength in&mdash;the other was Fire&mdash;but
she had it, and she could feel the chain, feel <em>inside</em> the
chain, feel the tiniest bits of the cold metal, the patterns they
made. The Power within her quivered in time to the vibrations of
those patterns.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Move out of my way, Egwene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked around and saw Nynaeve wrapped in the glow
of <em>saidar</em> and holding a prybar so close in color to the
blue-white of the light that it was nearly invisible. Nynaeve
frowned at the chain, muttered something about leverage, and the
prybar was suddenly twice as long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Move, Egwene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene moved.</p>

<p>Thrusting the end of the prybar through the chain,
Nynaeve braced it, then heaved with all her strength. The chain
snapped like thread, Nynaeve gasped and stumbled halfway across the
hall in surprise, and the prybar clattered to the floor.
Straightening, Nynaeve stared from the bar to the chain in
amazement. The prybar vanished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I did something to the chain,&rdquo; Egwene said.
<em>And I wish I knew what</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could have said something,&rdquo; Nynaeve muttered.
She pulled the rest of the chain from the staples and threw open
the door. &ldquo;Well? Are you going to stand there all day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dusty room inside was perhaps ten paces square,
but it held only a heap of large bags made of heavy brown cloth,
each stuffed full, tagged, and sealed with the Flame of Tar Valon.
Egwene did not have to count them to know there were thirteen.</p>

<p>She moved her ball of light to the wall and fastened
it there; she was not certain how she did it, but when she took her
hand away, the light remained. <em>I keep learning how to do things
without knowing what they are</em>, she thought nervously.</p>

<p>Elayne frowned at her as if considering, then hung
her light on the wall, too. Watching, Egwene thought she saw what
it was she had done. <em>She learned it from me, but I just learned
it from her</em>. She shivered.</p>

<p>Nynaeve went straight to tumbling the bags apart and
reading the tags. &ldquo;Rianna. Joiya Byir. These are what we are
after.&rdquo; She examined the seal on one bag, then broke the wax and
unwound the binding cords. &ldquo;At least we know no one&rsquo;s been here
before us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene chose a bag and broke the seal without reading
the name on the tag. She did not really want to know whose
possessions she was searching. When she upended them onto the dusty
floor, they proved to be mainly old clothes and shoes, with a few
ripped and crumpled papers of the sort that might hide under the
wardrobe of a woman who was not too assiduous in seeing her rooms
cleaned. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything useful here. A cloak that would not
do for rags. A torn half of a map of some city. Tear, it says in
the corner. Three stockings that need darning.&rdquo; She stuck her
finger through the hole in a velvet slipper that had no mate and
waggled it at the others. &ldquo;This one left no clues behind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amico did not leave anything, either,&rdquo; Elayne said
glumly, tossing clothes aside with both hands. &ldquo;It might as well be
rags. Wait, here&rsquo;s a book. Whoever bundled these up must have been
in a hurry to toss in a book. <em>Customs and Ceremonies of the
Tairen Court</em>. The cover is torn off, but the librarians will
want it anyway.&rdquo; The librarians certainly would. No one threw away
books, no matter how badly damaged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tear,&rdquo; Nynaeve said in flat voice. Kneeling amid the
clutter from the bag she was searching, she retrieved a scrap of
paper she had already thrown away. &ldquo;A list of trading ships on the
Erinin, with the dates they sailed from Tar Valon and the dates
they were expected to arrive in Tear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It could be coincidence,&rdquo; Egwene said slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. She folded the paper and
tucked it up her sleeve, then broke the seal on another bag.</p>

<p>When they finally finished, every bag searched twice
and discarded rubbish heaped around the edges of the room, Egwene
sat down on one of the empty bags, so engrossed that she barely
noticed her own wince. Drawing up her knees, she studied the little
collection they had made, all laid in a row.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is too much,&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;There is too much of
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too much,&rdquo; Nynaeve agreed.</p>

<p>There was a second book, a tattered, leather-bound
volume entitled <em>Observations on a Visit to Tear</em>, with half
its pages falling out. Caught in the lining of a badly torn cloak
in Chesmal Emry&rsquo;s bag, where it might have slipped through a rip in
one of the pockets of the cloak, had been another list of trading
vessels. It said no more than the names, but they were all on the
other list, too, and according to that, those vessels all had
sailed in the early morning after the night Liandrin and the others
left the Tower. There was a hastily sketched plan of some large
building, with one room faintly noted as &ldquo;Heart of the Stone,&rdquo; and
a page with the names of five inns, the word &ldquo;Tear&rdquo; heading the
page badly smudged but barely readable. There was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something from everyone,&rdquo; Egwene muttered.
&ldquo;Every one of them left something pointing to a journey to Tear.
How could anyone miss seeing it, if they looked? Why did the
Amyrlin say nothing of this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Amyrlin,&rdquo; Nynaeve said bitterly, &ldquo;keeps her own
counsel, and what matter if we burn for it!&rdquo; She drew a deep
breath, and sneezed from the dust they had stirred up. &ldquo;What
worries me is that I am looking at bait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bait?&rdquo; Egwene said. But she saw it as soon as she
spoke.</p>

<p>Nynaeve nodded. &ldquo;Bait. A trap. Or maybe a diversion.
But trap or diversion, it&rsquo;s so obvious no one could be taken in by
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unless they do not care whether whoever found this
saw the trap or not.&rdquo; Uncertainty tinged Elayne&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Or
perhaps they meant it to be so obvious that whoever found it would
dismiss Tear immediately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene wished she could not believe that the Black
Ajah could be as sure of themselves as that. She realized she was
gripping her pouch in her fingers, running her thumb along the
twisted curve of the stone ring inside. &ldquo;Perhaps they meant to
taunt whoever found it,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;Perhaps they thought
whoever found this would rush headlong after them, in anger and
pride.&rdquo; <em>Did they know we would find it? Do they see us that
way?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn me!&rdquo; Nynaeve growled. It was a shock; Nynaeve
never used such language.</p>

<p>For a time they simply stared in silence at the
array.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do we do now?&rdquo; Elayne asked finally.</p>

<p>Egwene squeezed the ring hard. Dreaming was closely
linked to Foretelling; the future, and events in other places,
could appear in a Dreamer&rsquo;s dreams. &ldquo;Maybe we will know after
tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve looked at her, silent and expressionless;
then chose out a dark skirt that seemed not to have too many holes
and rips, and began bundling in it the things they had found. &ldquo;For
now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we will take this back to my room and hide it. I
think we just have time, if we don&rsquo;t want to be late to the
kitchens.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Late</em>, Egwene thought. The longer she held
the ring through her pouch, the greater the urgency she felt. <em>
We&rsquo;re already a step behind, but maybe we won&rsquo;t be too
late</em>.</p>
