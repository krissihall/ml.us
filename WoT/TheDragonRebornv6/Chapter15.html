<h4><em>The Gray Man</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">O</span>utside
the Amyrlin Seat&rsquo;s study, Egwene and Nynaeve
found the corridors empty except for an occasional serving woman,
hurrying about her duties on soft-slippered feet. Egwene was
grateful for their presence. The halls suddenly seemed like
caverns, for all the tapestries and stonework. Dangerous
caverns.</p>

<p>Nynaeve strode along purposefully, tugging at her
braid fitfully again, and Egwene hurried to keep up. She did not
want to be left alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the Black Ajah <em>is</em> still here, Nynaeve,
and if they even suspect what we&rsquo;re doing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I hope you didn&rsquo;t
mean what you said about acting as if we are already bound by the
Three Oaths. I don&rsquo;t intend to let them kill me, not if I can stop
it by channeling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If any of them are still here, Egwene, they will
know what we are doing as soon as they see us.&rdquo; Despite what she
was saying, Nynaeve sounded preoccupied. &ldquo;Or at least they will see
us as a threat, and that&rsquo;s much the same thing as far as what they
will do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How will they see us as a threat? Nobody is
threatened by someone they can order about. Nobody is threatened by
someone who has to scrub pots and turn the spits three times a day.
That&rsquo;s why the Amyrlin is putting us to work in the kitchens. Part
of the reason, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the Amyrlin did not think it through,&rdquo;
Nynaeve said absently. &ldquo;Or perhaps she did, and means something
different for us than what she claims. Think, Egwene. Liandrin
would not have tried to put us out of the way unless she thought we
were a threat to her. I can&rsquo;t imagine how, or to what, but I cannot
see how it could have changed, either. If there are any Black Ajah
still here, they will surely see us the same way, whether they
suspect what we&rsquo;re doing or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene swallowed. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that. Light, I
wish I were invisible. Nynaeve, if they are still after us, I will
risk being stilled before I let Darkfriends kill me, or maybe
worse. And I won&rsquo;t believe you will let them take you, either, no
matter what you told the Amyrlin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I meant it.&rdquo; For a moment Nynaeve seemed to rouse
from her thoughts. Her steps slowed. A pale-haired novice carrying
a tray rushed past. &ldquo;I meant every word, Egwene.&rdquo; Nynaeve went on
when the novice was out of hearing. &ldquo;There are other ways to defend
ourselves. If there were not, Aes Sedai would be killed every time
they left the Tower. We just have to reason those ways out, and use
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know several ways already, and so do you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are dangerous.&rdquo; Egwene opened her mouth to say
they were only dangerous to whoever attacked her, but Nynaeve
plowed on over her. &ldquo;You can come to like them too much. When I let
out all my anger at those Whitecloaks this morning&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;It felt
too good. It is too dangerous.&rdquo; She shivered and quickened her pace
again, and Egwene had to step lively to catch up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sound like Sheriam. You never have before. You
have pushed every limit they&rsquo;ve put on you. Why would you accept
limits now, when we might have to ignore them to stay alive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What good if it ends with us being put out of the
Tower? Stilled or not, what good then?&rdquo; Nynaeve&rsquo;s voice dropped as
if she were speaking to herself. &ldquo;I can do it. I must, if I&rsquo;m to
stay here long enough to learn, and I must learn if I&rsquo;m to&mdash;&rdquo;
Suddenly she seemed to realize she was speaking aloud. She shot a
hard look at Egwene, and her voice firmed. &ldquo;Let me think. Please,
be quiet and let me think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene held her tongue, but inside she bubbled with
unasked questions. What special reason did Nynaeve have for wanting
to learn more of what the White Tower could teach? What was it she
wanted to do? Why was Nynaeve keeping it secret from her? <em>Secrets.
We&rsquo;ve learned to keep too many secrets since coming to the
Tower. The Amyrlin is keeping secrets from us, too. Light, what is
she going to do about Mat?</em></p>

<p>Nynaeve accompanied her all the way back to the
novices&rsquo; quarters, not turning aside to the Accepted&rsquo;s quarters.
The galleries were still empty, and they met no one as they climbed
the spiraling ramps.</p>

<p>As they came up on Elayne&rsquo;s room, Nynaeve stopped,
knocked once, and immediately opened the door and put her head
inside. Then she was letting the white door swing shut and striding
toward the next, Egwene&rsquo;s room. &ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t here yet,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
need to talk to both of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene caught her shoulders and pulled her to an
abrupt halt. &ldquo;What&mdash;?&rdquo; Something tugged at her hair, stung her
ear. A black blur streaked in front of her face to clang against
the wall, and in the next breath Nynaeve was bearing her to the
gallery floor, behind the railing.</p>

<p>Wide-eyed and sprawling, Egwene stared at what lay on
the stone in front of her door, where it had fallen. A bolt from a
crossbow. A few dark strands from her hair were tangled in the four
heavy prongs, meant for punching through armor. She raised a
trembling hand to touch her ear, to touch the tiniest nick, damp
with a bead of blood. <em>If I had not stopped just then</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>If I hadn&rsquo;t</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The quarrel would have gone right
through her head, and would probably have killed Nynaeve, too.
&ldquo;Blood and ashes!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Blood and bloody ashes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch your language,&rdquo; Nynaeve admonished, but her
heart was not in it. She lay peering between the white stone
balusters toward the far side of the galleries. A glow surrounded
her, to Egwene&rsquo;s eyes. She had embraced <em>saidar</em>.</p>

<p>Hastily, Egwene tried to reach out for the One Power,
too, but at first haste defeated her. Haste, and images that kept
intruding on the emptiness, images of her head being ripped apart
like a rotten melon by a heavy quarrel that went on to bury itself
in Nynaeve. She took a deep breath and tried again, and finally the
rose floated in nothingness, opened to the True Source, and the
Power filled her.</p>

<p>She rolled onto her stomach to peer through the
railing beside Nynaeve. &ldquo;Do you see anything? Do you see him? I&rsquo;ll
put a lightning bolt through him!&rdquo; She could feel it building,
pressing on her to loose it. &ldquo;It <em>is</em> a man, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; She
could not imagine a man coming into the novices&rsquo; quarters, but it
was impossible to picture a woman carrying a crossbow through the
Tower.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Quiet anger filled Nynaeve&rsquo;s voice;
her anger was always at its worst when she grew quiet with it. &ldquo;I
thought I saw&mdash;Yes! There!&rdquo; Egwene felt the Power pulse in
the other woman, and then Nynaeve was unhurriedly getting to her
feet, brushing at her dress as if there were nothing more to worry
about.</p>

<p>Egwene stared at her. &ldquo;What? What did you do?
Nynaeve?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;Of the Five Powers,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; Nynaeve said in a lecturing
tone, faintly mocking, &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;Air, sometimes called Wind, is thought by
many to be of the least use. This is far from true.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; She finished
with a tight laugh. &ldquo;I told you there were other ways to defend
ourselves. I used Air, to hold him with air. If it is a he; I could
not see him clearly. A trick the Amyrlin showed me once, though I
doubt she expected me to see how it was done. Well, are you going
to lie there all day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene scrambled up to hurry after her around the
gallery. Before long a man did come into sight around the curve,
dressed in plain brown breeches and coat. He stood facing the other
way, balanced on the ball of one foot, with the other hanging in
midair as if he had been caught in the middle of running. The man
would feel as if he were buried in thick jelly, yet it was nothing
but air stiffened around him. Egwene remembered the Amyrlin&rsquo;s
trick, too, but she did not think she could duplicate it. Nynaeve
only had to see a thing done once to know how to do it herself.
When she could manage to channel at all, of course.</p>

<p>They came closer, and Egwene&rsquo;s melding with the Power
vanished in shock. The hilt of a dagger stood out from the man&rsquo;s
chest. His face sagged, and death had already filmed his
half-closed eyes. He crumpled to the gallery floor as Nynaeve
loosed the trap that had held him.</p>

<p>He was an average-appearing man, of average height
and average build, with features so ordinary Egwene did not think
she would have noticed him in a group of three. She only studied
him a moment, though, before realizing that something was missing.
A crossbow.</p>

<p>She gave a start and looked about wildly. &ldquo;There had
to be another one, Nynaeve. Somebody took the crossbow. And
somebody stabbed him. He could be out there ready to shoot at us
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Calm yourself,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, but she peered both
ways along the gallery, jerking at her braid. &ldquo;Just be calm, and we
will figure out what to&mdash;&rdquo; Her words cut off at the sound of
steps on the ramp leading up to their level.</p>

<p>Egwene&rsquo;s heart pounded, seemingly in her throat. Eyes
fastened on the head of the ramp, she desperately strove to touch
<em>saidar</em> again, but for her that required calm, and her
heartbeats shattered calm.</p>

<p>Sheriam Sedai stopped at the top of the ramp,
frowning at what she saw. &ldquo;What in the name of the Light has
happened here?&rdquo; She hurried forward, her serenity gone for
once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We found him,&rdquo; Nynaeve said as the Mistress of
Novices knelt beside the corpse.</p>

<p>Sheriam put a hand to the man&rsquo;s chest, and jerked it
back twice as fast, hissing. Steeling herself visibly, she touched
him again, and maintained the Touch longer. &ldquo;Dead,&rdquo; she muttered.
&ldquo;As dead as it is possible to be, and more.&rdquo; When she straightened,
she pulled a handkerchief from her sleeve and wiped her fingers.
&ldquo;You found him? Here? Like this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene nodded, sure that if she spoke, Sheriam would
hear the lie in her voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We did,&rdquo; Nynaeve said firmly.</p>

<p>Sheriam shook her head. &ldquo;A man&mdash;a dead man, at
that!&mdash;in the novices&rsquo; quarters would be scandal enough, but
this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What makes him different?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked. &ldquo;And how
could he be <em>more</em> than dead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sheriam took a deep breath, and gave them each a
searching look. &ldquo;He is one of the Soulless. A Gray Man.&rdquo; Absently,
she wiped her fingers again, her eyes going back to the body.
Worried eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Soulless?&rdquo; Egwene said, a tremor in her voice,
at the same time that Nynaeve said, &ldquo;A Gray Man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sheriam glanced at them, a look as penetrating as it
was brief. &ldquo;Not a part of your studies, yet, but you seem to have
gone beyond the rules in a great many ways. And considering you
found this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She gestured to the corpse. &ldquo;The Soulless, the
Gray Men, give up their souls to serve the Dark One as assassins.
They are not really alive, after that. Not quite dead, but not
truly alive. And despite the name, some Gray Men are women. A very
few. Even among Darkfriends, only a handful of women are stupid
enough to make that sacrifice. You can look right at them and
hardly notice them, until it is too late. He was as much as dead
while he walked. Now, only my eyes tell me that what is lying there
ever lived at all.&rdquo; She gave them another long look. &ldquo;No Gray Man
has dared enter Tar Valon since the Trolloc Wars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will you do?&rdquo; Egwene asked. Sheriam&rsquo;s brows
rose, and she quickly added, &ldquo;If I may ask, Sheriam Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai hesitated. &ldquo;I suppose you may, since
you had the bad luck to find him. It will be up to the Amyrlin
Seat, but with everything that has happened, I believe she will
want to keep this as quiet as is possible. We do not need more
rumors. You will speak of this to none but me, or to the Amyrlin,
should she mention it first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Egwene said fervently. Nynaeve&rsquo;s
voice was cooler.</p>

<p>Sheriam appeared to take their obedience for granted.
She gave no sign of having heard them. Her attention was all on the
dead man. The Gray Man. The Soulless. &ldquo;There will be no hiding the
fact that a man was killed here.&rdquo; The glow of the One Power
suddenly surrounded her, and just as abruptly, a long, low dome
covered the body on the floor, grayish and so opaque that it was
hard to see there was a body under it. &ldquo;But this will keep anyone
else from touching him who can discover his nature. I must have
this removed before the novices come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her tilted green eyes regarded them as if she had
just remembered their presence. &ldquo;You two go, now. To your room, I
think, Nynaeve. Considering what you are already facing, if it
became known you were involved in this, even on the edge of it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene curtsied, and tugged at Nynaeve&rsquo;s sleeve, but
Nynaeve said, &ldquo;Why did you come up here, Sheriam Sedai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Sheriam looked startled, but on the
instant she frowned. Fists on her hips, she regarded Nynaeve with
all the firmness of her office. &ldquo;Does the Mistress of Novices now
need an excuse for coming to the novices&rsquo; quarters, Accepted?&rdquo; she
said softly. &ldquo;Do Accepted now question Aes Sedai? The Amyrlin means
to make something of you two, but whether she does or not, I will
teach you manners, at least. Now, the pair of you, go, before I
haul you both down to my study, and not for the appointment the
Amyrlin Seat has already set for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A sudden thought came to Egwene. &ldquo;Forgive me, Sheriam
Sedai,&rdquo; she said quickly, &ldquo;but I must fetch my cloak. I feel cold.&rdquo;
She rushed away, around the gallery before the Aes Sedai could
speak.</p>

<p>If Sheriam found that crossbow bolt in front of her
door, there would be too many questions. No pretending they had
only found the man, that he had no connection to her, then. But
when she reached the door to her room, the heavy bolt was gone.
Only the jagged chip in the stone beside the door said it had ever
been there.</p>

<p>Egwene&rsquo;s skin crawled. <em>How could anyone take it
without one of us seeing</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Another Gray Man!</em> She
had embraced <em>saidar</em> before she knew it, only the sweet
flow of the Power inside her telling her what she had done. Even
so, it was one of the hardest things she had ever done, opening
that door and going into her room. There was no one there. She
snatched the white cloak off its peg and ran out, anyway, and she
did not release <em>saidar</em> until she was halfway back to the
others.</p>

<p>Something more had passed between the women while she
was gone. Nynaeve was attempting to appear meek, and succeeding
only in looking as if she had a sour stomach. Sheriam had her fists
on her hips and was tapping her foot irritably, and the stare she
was giving Nynaeve, like green millstones ready to start grinding
barley flour, took in Egwene equally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, Sheriam Sedai,&rdquo; she said hastily,
dropping a curtsy and settling her cloak on her shoulders at the
same time. &ldquo;This&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;finding a dead man&mdash;a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a Gray Man!&mdash;it made me cold. If we may go now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At Sheriam&rsquo;s tight nod of dismissal, Nynaeve made a
bare curtsy. Egwene seized her arm and hustled her away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you trying to <em>make</em> more trouble for
us?&rdquo; she demanded when they were two levels down. And safely out of
earshot of Sheriam, she hoped. &ldquo;What else did you say to her, to
make her glare like that? More questions, I suppose? I hope you
learned something worth making her mad at us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She would not say anything,&rdquo; Nynaeve muttered. &ldquo;We
must ask questions if we are to do any good, Egwene. We will have
to take a few chances, or we&rsquo;ll never learn anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene sighed. &ldquo;Well, be a little more circumspect.&rdquo;
From the set of Nynaeve&rsquo;s face, the other woman had no intention of
going easy or avoiding risks. Egwene sighed again. &ldquo;The crossbow
bolt was gone, Nynaeve. It must have been another Gray Man who took
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that is why you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Light!&rdquo; Nynaeve frowned and
gave a sharp tug to her braid.</p>

<p>After a time Egwene said, &ldquo;What was that she did to
cover the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the body?&rdquo; She did not want to think of it as a
Gray Man; that reminded her there was another one out there. She
did not want to think of anything at all, right then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Air,&rdquo; Nynaeve replied. &ldquo;She used Air. A neat trick,
and I think I see how to make something useful with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The use of the One Power was divided into the Five
Powers: Earth, Air, Fire, Water, and Spirit. Different Talents
required different combinations of the Five Powers. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
understand some of the ways the Five Powers are combined. Take
Healing. I can see why it requires Spirit, and maybe Air, but why
Water?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve rounded on her. &ldquo;What are you babbling about?
Have you forgotten what we&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo; She looked around. They had
reached the Accepted&rsquo;s quarters, a stack of galleries lower than
the novices&rsquo; quarters, surrounding a garden rather than a court.
There was no one in sight except for another Accepted, hurrying
along on another level, but she lowered her voice. &ldquo;Have you
forgotten the Black Ajah?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am trying to forget it,&rdquo; Egwene said fiercely.
&ldquo;For a little while, anyway. I am trying to forget that we just
left a dead man. I&rsquo;m trying to forget that he almost killed me, and
that he has a companion who might try it again.&rdquo; She touched her
ear; the drop of blood had dried, but the nick still hurt. &ldquo;We are
lucky we aren&rsquo;t both dead right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s face softened, but when she spoke her voice
held something of the time when she had been the Wisdom of Emond&rsquo;s
Field, saying words that had to be said for someone&rsquo;s own good.
&ldquo;Remember that body, Egwene. Remember that he tried to kill you.
Kill us. Remember the Black Ajah. Remember them all the time.
Because if you forget, just once, the next time, it may be you
lying dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Egwene sighed. &ldquo;But I do not have to like
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you notice what Sheriam did not mention?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She never wondered who stabbed him. Now, come on. My
room is just down here, and you can put your feet up while we
talk.&rdquo;</p>
