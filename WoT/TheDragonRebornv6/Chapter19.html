<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">M</span>at
opened his eyes slowly and stared up at the white
plaster ceiling, wondering where he was and how he had come there.
An intricate fringe of gilded leaves bordered the ceiling, and the
mattress under his back felt plumped full of feathers. Somewhere
rich, then. Somewhere with money. But his head was empty of the
where and the how, and a lot more besides.</p>

<p>He had been dreaming, and bits of those dreams still
tumbled together with memories in his head. He could not separate
one from the other. Wild flights and fights, strange people from
across the ocean, Ways and Portal Stones and pieces of other lives,
things right out of a gleeman&rsquo;s tales, these had to be dreams. At
least, he thought they must be. But Loial was no dream, and he was
an Ogier. Chunks of conversations drifted around in his thoughts,
talks with his father, with friends, with Moiraine, and a beautiful
woman, and a ship captain, and a well-dressed man who spoke to him
like a father giving sage advice. Those were probably real. But it
was all bits and fragments. Drifting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Muad&rsquo;drin tia dar allende caba&rsquo;drin
rhadiem,</em>&rdquo; he murmured. The words were only sounds, yet they
sparked&mdash;something.</p>

<p><em>The packed lines of spearmen stretched a mile or
more to either side below him, dotted with the pennants and banners
of towns and cities and minor Houses. The river secured his flank
on the left, the bogs and mires on the right. From the hillside he
watched the spearmen struggle against the mass of Trollocs trying
to break through, ten times the humans&rsquo; number. Spears pierced
black Trolloc mail, and spiked axes carved bloody gaps in the human
ranks. Screams and bellows harried the air. The sun burned hot
overhead in a cloudless sky, and shimmers of heat rose above the
battle line. Arrows still rained down from the enemy, slaying
Trolloc and human alike. He had called his archers back, but the
Dreadlords did not care so long as they broke his line. On the
ridge behind him, the Heart Guard awaited his command, horses
stamping impatiently. Armor on men and horses alike shone silver in
the sunlight; neither men nor animals could stand the heat much
longer</em>.</p>

<p><em>They must win here or die. He was known as a
gambler; it was time to toss the dice. In a voice that carried over
the tumult below, he gave the order as he swung up into his saddle.
&ldquo;Footmen prepare to pass cavalry forward.&rdquo; His bannerman rode close
beside him, the Red Eagle banner flapping over his head, as the
command was repeated up and down the line</em>.</p>

<p><em>Below, the spearmen suddenly moved, sidestepping
with good discipline, narrowing their formations, opening wide gaps
between. Gaps into which the Trollocs poured, roaring bestial
cries, like a black, oozing tide of death</em>.</p>

<p><em>He drew his sword, raised it high. &ldquo;Forward the
Heart Guard!&rdquo; He dug his heels in, and his mount leaped down the
slope. Behind him, hooves thundered in the charge. &ldquo;Forward.&rdquo; He
was first to strike into the Trollocs, his sword rising and
falling, his bannerman close behind. &ldquo;For the honor of the Red
Eagle!&rdquo; The Heart Guard pounded into the gaps between the spearmen,
smashing the tide, hurling it back. &ldquo;The Red Eagle!&rdquo; Half-human
faces snarled at him, oddly curved swords sought him, but he cut
his way ever deeper. Win or die. &ldquo;Manetheren!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat&rsquo;s hand trembled as he raised it to his forehead.
&ldquo;<em>Los Valdar Cuebiyari,</em>&rdquo; he muttered. He was almost sure he
knew what it meant&mdash;&ldquo;Forward the Heart Guard,&rdquo; or maybe &ldquo;The
Heart Guard will advance&rdquo;&mdash;but that could not be. Moiraine
had told him a few words of the Old Tongue, and those were all he
knew of it. The rest might as well be magpie chatter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crazy,&rdquo; he said roughly. &ldquo;It probably isn&rsquo;t even the
Old Tongue at all. Just gibberish. That Aes Sedai is crazy. It was
only a dream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aes Sedai. Moiraine. He suddenly became aware of his
too-thin wrist and bony hand, and looked at them. He had been sick.
Something to do with a dagger. A dagger with a ruby in the hilt,
and a long-dead, tainted city called Shadar Logoth. It was all
foggy and distant, and made no real sense, but he knew it was no
dream. Egwene and Nynaeve had been taking him to Tar Valon to be
Healed. He remembered that much.</p>

<p>He tried to sit up, and fell back, as weak as a
newborn lamb. Laboriously, he pulled himself up and shoved the
single woolen blanket aside. His clothes were gone, perhaps into
the vine-carved wardrobe standing against the wall. For the moment
he did not care about clothes. He struggled to his feet, tottered
across the flowered carpet to cling to a high-backed armchair, and
lurched from the chair to the table, gilded scrolls on its legs and
edges.</p>

<p>Beeswax candles, four to each tall stand and small
mirrors behind the flames, lit the room brightly. A larger mirror
on the wall above the highly polished washstand threw his
reflection back at him, gaunt and wasted, cheeks hollow and dark
eyes sunken, hair sweat-matted, bent like an old man and wavering
like pasture grass in a breeze. He made himself stand straight, but
it was not much improvement.</p>

<p>A large, covered tray sat on the table in front of
his hands, and his nose caught the smells of food. He twitched
aside the cloth, revealing two large silver pitchers and dishes of
thin green porcelain. He had heard that the Sea Folk charged its
weight in silver for that porcelain. He had expected beef tea, or
sweetbreads, the kinds of things invalids had pushed on them.
Instead, one plate held slices of a beef roast piled thickly, with
brown mustard and horseradish. On others there were roasted
potatoes, sweetbeans with onions, cabbage, and butterpeas. Pickles,
and a wedge of yellow cheese. Thick slices of crusty bread, and a
dish of butter. One pitcher was filled with milk and still beaded
with condensation on the outside, the other with what smelled like
spiced wine. There was enough of everything for four men. His mouth
watered, and his stomach growled at him.</p>

<p><em>First I find out where I am</em>. But he rolled
up a slice of beef and dipped it in the mustard before pushing
himself away from the table toward the three tall, narrow
windows.</p>

<p>Wooden shutters carved in lacy patterns covered them,
but through the holes he could see that it was night outside.
Lights from other windows made dots in the blackness. For a moment
he sagged against the white stone windowsill in frustration, but
then he began to think.</p>

<p>You can turn the worst that comes to your advantage
if you only think, his father always said, and certainly Abell
Cauthon was the best horse trader in the Two Rivers. When it seemed
somebody had taken advantage of Mat&rsquo;s father, it always turned out
they had gotten the greasy end of the stick. Not that Abell Cauthon
ever did anything dishonest, but even Taren Ferry folk never got
the best of him, and everybody knew how close to the bone they cut.
All because he thought about things from every side that there
was.</p>

<p>Tar Valon. It had to be Tar Valon. This room belonged
in a palace. The flowered Domani carpet alone probably cost as much
as a farm. More, he did not think he was sick any longer, and from
what he had been told, Tar Valon was his only chance to get well.
He had never actually felt sick, not that he remembered, not even
when Verin&mdash;another name swam out of the haze&mdash;had told
someone nearby that he was dying. Now he felt weak as a babe and
hungry as a starving wolf, but somehow, he was sure the Healing had
been done. <em>I feel</em>&mdash;<em>whole and well, that&rsquo;s all.
I&rsquo;ve been Healed</em>. He grimaced at the shutters.</p>

<p>Healed. That meant they had used the One Power on
him. The notion sent goose bumps marching across his skin, but he
had known it would be done. &ldquo;Better than dying,&rdquo; he told himself.
Some of the stories he had heard about Aes Sedai came back. &ldquo;It has
to be better than dying. Even Nynaeve thought I was going to die.
Anyway, it&rsquo;s done, and worrying about it now won&rsquo;t help anything.&rdquo;
He realized he had finished the slice of beef and was licking its
juice from his fingers.</p>

<p>Unsteadily, he made his way back to the table. There
was a stool underneath. He pulled it out and sat down. Not
bothering with knife or fork, he made another roll of beef. How
could he turn being in Tar Valon&mdash;<em>In the White Tower. It
has to be</em>&mdash;to his advantage?</p>

<p>Tar Valon meant Aes Sedai. That was certainly no
reason to stay even an hour. Exactly the opposite. What he
remembered of his time with Moiraine, and later with Verin, was not
much to go on. He could not recall either of them doing anything
really terrible, but then he could not recall a great deal of that
time at all. Anyway, whatever Aes Sedai did, they did for their own
reasons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And those aren&rsquo;t always the reasons you think they
are,&rdquo; he mumbled around a mouthful of potato, then swallowed. &ldquo;An
Aes Sedai never lies, but the truth an Aes Sedai tells you isn&rsquo;t
always the truth you think it is. That&rsquo;s one thing I have to
remember: I can&rsquo;t be sure about them even when I think I know.&rdquo; It
was not a cheering conclusion. He filled his mouth with
butterpeas.</p>

<p>Thinking about Aes Sedai made him remember a little
about them.</p>

<p>The seven Ajahs: Blue, Red, Brown, Green, Yellow,
White, and Gray. The Reds were the worst. <em>Except for that Black
Ajah they all claim doesn&rsquo;t exist</em>. But the Red Ajah should be
no threat to him. They were only interested in men who could
channel.</p>

<p><em>Rand. Burn me, how could I forget that? Where is
he? Is he all right?</em> He sighed regretfully, and spread butter
on a piece of still-warm bread. <em>I wonder if he&rsquo;s gone mad
yet.</em></p>

<p>Even if he knew the answers, he could do nothing to
help Rand. He was not sure he would if he could. Rand could
channel, and Mat had grown up with stories of men channeling,
stories to frighten children. Stories that frightened adults, too,
because some of them were all too true. Discovering what Rand could
do had been like finding out his best friend tortured small animals
and killed babies. Once you finally made yourself believe it, it
was hard to call him a friend any longer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to look out for myself,&rdquo; he said angrily. He
upended the wine pitcher over his silver cup and was surprised to
find it empty. He filled the cup with milk, instead. &ldquo;Egwene and
Nynaeve want to be Aes Sedai.&rdquo; He had not really remembered that
until he said it aloud. &ldquo;Rand is following Moiraine around and
calling himself the Dragon Reborn. The Light knows what Perrin is
up to. He&rsquo;s been acting crazy ever since his eyes turned funny. I
have to look out for myself.&rdquo; <em>Burn me, I have to! I&rsquo;m the last
one of us who&rsquo;s still sane. There&rsquo;s only me</em>.</p>

<p>Tar Valon. Well it was supposed to be the wealthiest
city in the world, and it was the center of trade between the
Borderlands and the south, the center of Aes Sedai power. He did
not think he could get an Aes Sedai to gamble with him. Or trust
the fall of the dice or the turn of the cards if he did. But there
had to be merchants, and others with silver and gold. The city
itself would be worth a few days. He knew he had traveled far since
leaving the Two Rivers, but aside from a few vague memories of
Caemlyn and Cairhien, he could remember nothing of any great
cities. He had always wanted to see a great city.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But not one full of Aes Sedai,&rdquo; he muttered sourly,
scraping up the last of the butterpeas. He gulped them down and
went back for another helping of beef.</p>

<p>Idly, he wondered if the Aes Sedai might let him have
the ruby from the Shadar Logoth dagger. He remembered the dagger in
only the fuzziest way, but even that was like remembering a
terrible injury. His insides knotted up, and sharp pain dug at his
temples. Yet the ruby was clear in his mind, as big as his
thumbnail, dark as a drop of blood, glittering like some crimson
eye. Surely he had more claim to it than they did, and it had to be
worth as much as a dozen farms back home.</p>

<p><em>They&rsquo;ll probably say it is tainted, too</em>. And
likely it was. Still he spun a little fancy of trading the ruby to
some of the Coplins for their best land. Most of that
family&mdash;troublemakers from the cradle, where they were not
thieves and liars as well&mdash;deserved whatever happened to them
and more. But he really did not believe the Aes Sedai would give it
back to him, did not relish the notion of carrying it as far as
Emond&rsquo;s Field if they did. And the thought of owning the largest
farm in the Two Rivers was no longer as exciting as it once had
been. Once that had been his biggest ambition, that, and to be
known as his father&rsquo;s equal as a horse trader. Now it seemed such a
small thing to want. A cramped thing, with the whole wide world
just waiting out there.</p>

<p>First off, he decided, he would find Egwene and
Nynaeve. <em>Maybe they&rsquo;ve come to their senses. Maybe they&rsquo;ve
given up this foolishness about becoming Aes Sedai</em>. He did not
think they would have, but he could not go without seeing them. He
would go; that was sure. A visit with them, a day to see the city,
perhaps a game with the dice to pad out his purse, and then he
would be off for somewhere where there were no Aes Sedai. Before he
returned home&mdash;<em>I will go home one day. One day, I
will</em>&mdash;he meant to see something of the world, and
without any Aes Sedai making him dance to her tune.</p>

<p>Rummaging around the tray for something more to eat,
he was shocked to realize nothing was left but smears and a few
crumbs of bread and cheese. The pitchers were both empty. He
squinted down at his stomach in wonder. He should have been stuffed
to the ears with all that in him, but he felt as if he had hardly
eaten at all. He scraped the last bits of cheese together between
thumb and forefinger. Halfway to his mouth, his hand froze.</p>

<p><em>I blew the Horn of Valere</em>. Softly he
whistled a bit of tune, then cut it short when the words came to
him:</p>

<p class="verse">I&rsquo;m down at the bottom of the well.<br>
It&rsquo;s night, and the rain is coming down.<br>
The sides are falling in,<br>
and there&rsquo;s no rope to climb.<br>
I&rsquo;m down at the bottom of the well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There had better be a bloody rope to climb,&rdquo; he
whispered. He let the cheese and crumbs fall on the tray. For the
moment he felt sick again. Determinedly he tried to think, tried to
penetrate the fog that shrouded everything in his head.</p>

<p>Verin had been bringing the Horn to Tar Valon, but he
could not remember if she knew he was the one who had blown it. She
had never said anything to make him think so. He was sure of that.
He thought he was. <em>So what if she does know? What if they all
do? Unless Verin did something with it I don&rsquo;t know about, they
have the Horn. They don&rsquo;t need me</em>. But who could say what Aes
Sedai thought they needed?</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they ask,&rdquo; he said grimly, &ldquo;I never even touched
it. If they know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;If they know, I&rsquo;ll&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll handle that
when it comes. Burn me, they can&rsquo;t want anything from me. They
can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A soft knock on the door brought him swaying to his
feet, ready to run. If there had been any place to run to, and if
he could have managed more than three steps. But there was not, and
he could not.</p>

<p>The door opened.</p>
