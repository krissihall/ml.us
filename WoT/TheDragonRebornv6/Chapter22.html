<h4><em>The Price of The Ring</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">E</span>gwene
had only gone a short distance from Verin&rsquo;s
rooms when Sheriam met her. The Mistress of Novices wore a
preoccupied frown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If someone hadn&rsquo;t remembered Verin speaking to you,
I might not have found you.&rdquo; The Aes Sedai sounded mildly
irritated. &ldquo;Come along, child. You are holding everything up! What
are those papers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene clutched them a little tighter. She tried to
make her voice both meek and respectful. &ldquo;Verin Sedai thinks I
should study them, Aes Sedai.&rdquo; What would she do if Sheriam asked
to see them? What excuse could she give for refusing, what
explanation for pages telling all about thirteen women of the Black
Ajah and the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> they had stolen?</p>

<p>But Sheriam seemed to have dismissed the papers from
her mind as soon as she asked. &ldquo;Never mind that. You are wanted,
and everyone is waiting.&rdquo; She took Egwene&rsquo;s arm and forced her to
walk faster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wanted, Sheriam Sedai? Waiting for what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sheriam shook her head with exasperation. &ldquo;Did you
forget that you are to be raised to the Accepted? When you come to
my study tomorrow, you will be wearing the ring, though I doubt it
will soothe you very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene tried to stop short, but the Aes Sedai hurried
her on, taking a narrow set of stairs that curled down through the
library walls. &ldquo;Tonight? Already? But I am half-asleep, Aes Sedai,
and dirty, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I thought I would have days yet. To get ready.
To prepare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The hour waits on no woman,&rdquo; Sheriam said. &ldquo;The
Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills, <em>when</em> the Wheel wills.
Besides, how would you prepare? You already know the things you
must. More than your friend Nynaeve did.&rdquo; She pushed Egwene through
a tiny door at the foot of the stairs and hurried her across
another hall to a ramp curving down and down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I listened to the lectures,&rdquo; Egwene protested, &ldquo;and
I remember them, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;can&rsquo;t I have a night&rsquo;s sleep first?&rdquo; The
winding ramp seemed to have no end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Amyrlin Seat decided there was no point in
waiting.&rdquo; Sheriam gave Egwene a sidelong smile. &ldquo;Her exact words
were, &lsquo;Once you decide to gut a fish, there&rsquo;s no use waiting till
it rots.&rsquo; Elayne has already been through the arches by this time,
and the Amyrlin means you to go through tonight as well. Not that I
can see the point of such a hurry,&rdquo; she added, half to herself,
&ldquo;but when the Amyrlin commands, we obey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene let herself be pulled down the ramp in
silence, a knot forming in her belly. Nynaeve had been far from
forthcoming about what had happened when she was raised to the
Accepted. She would not speak of it at all, except for a grimaced,
&lsquo;I hate Aes Sedai!&rsquo; Egwene was trembling by the time the ramp
finally ended at a broad hallway, far below the Tower in the rock
of the island.</p>

<p>The hall was plain and undecorated, the pale rock
through which it had been hewn smoothed but left otherwise
untouched, and there was only one set of dark wooden doors, as tall
and wide as fortress gates and as plain, although of smoothly
finished and finely fitted planks, at the very end. Those great
doors were so well balanced, though, that Sheriam easily pushed one
open, and pulled Egwene through after her, into a great, domed
chamber.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not before time!&rdquo; Elaida snapped. She stood to one
side in her red-fringed shawl, beside a table on which sat three
large silver chalices.</p>

<p>Lamps on tall stands illumined the chamber, and what
sat centered under the dome. Three rounded, silver arches, just
tall enough to walk under, sitting on a thick silver ring with
their ends touching where they joined it. An Aes Sedai sat
cross-legged on the bare rock before each of the spots where arches
joined ring, all three wearing their shawls. Alanna was the sister
of the Green Ajah, but she did not know the Yellow sister, or the
White.</p>

<p>Surrounded by the glow of <em>saidar</em> embraced,
the three Aes Sedai stared fixedly at the arches, and within the
silver structure an answering glow flickered and grew. That
structure was a <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, and whatever it had been made
for in the Age of Legends, now novices passed through it to become
Accepted. Inside it, Egwene would have to face her fears. Three
times. The white light within the arches no longer flickered; it
stayed within them as if confined, but it filled the space, made it
opaque.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be easy, Elaida,&rdquo; Sheriam said calmly. &ldquo;We will be
done soon.&rdquo; She turned to Egwene. &ldquo;Novices are given three chances
at this. You may refuse twice to enter, but at the third refusal,
you are sent away from the Tower forever. That is how it is done
usually, and you certainly have the right to refuse, but I do not
think the Amyrlin Seat will be pleased with you if you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She should not be given this chance.&rdquo; There was iron
in Elaida&rsquo;s voice, and her face was scarcely softer. &ldquo;I do not care
what her potential is. She should be put out of the Tower. Or
failing that, set to scrubbing floors for the next ten years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sheriam gave the Red sister a sharp look. &ldquo;You were
not so adamant about Elayne. You demanded to be part of this,
Elaida&mdash;perhaps because of Elayne&mdash;and you will do your
part for this girl as well, as you are supposed to, or you will
leave and I will find another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two Aes Sedai stared at one another until Egwene
would not have been surprised to see the glow of the One Power
surround them. Finally Elaida gave a toss of her head and sniffed
loudly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it must be done, let us do it. Give the miserable
girl her chance to refuse and be done with it. It is late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t refuse.&rdquo; Egwene&rsquo;s voice quavered, but she
steadied it and held her head high. &ldquo;I want to go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Sheriam said. &ldquo;Good. Now I will tell you two
things no woman hears until she stands where you do. Once you
begin, you must go on to the end. Refuse at any point, and you will
be put out of the Tower just as if you had refused to begin for the
third time. Second. To seek, to strive, is to know danger.&rdquo; She
sounded as if she had said this many times. There was a light of
sympathy in her eyes, but her face was almost as stern as Elaida&rsquo;s.
The sympathy frightened Egwene more than the sternness. &ldquo;Some women
have entered, and never come out. When the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> was
allowed to grow quiet, they&mdash;were&mdash;not&mdash;there. And they
were never seen again. If you will survive, you must be steadfast.
Falter, fail, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Sheriam&rsquo;s face drove the unspoken words
home; Egwene shivered. &ldquo;This is your last chance. Refuse now, and
it counts only as the first. You may still try twice more. If you
accept now, there is no turning back. It is no shame to refuse. I
could not do it, my first time. Choose.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>They never came out?</em> Egwene swallowed hard.
<em>I want to be Aes Sedai. And first I have to become
Accepted</em>. &ldquo;I accept.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sheriam nodded. &ldquo;Then ready yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene blinked, then remembered. She had to enter
unclothed. She bent to set down the tied bundle of papers Verin had
given her&mdash;and hesitated. If she left them there, Sheriam or
Elaida either one could go through them while she was inside the
<em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. They could find that smaller <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em> in her pouch. If she refused to go on, she could
hide them away, perhaps leave them with Nynaeve. Her breath caught.
<em>I cannot refuse now. I&rsquo;ve already begun</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you already chosen to refuse, child?&rdquo; Sheriam
asked, frowning. &ldquo;Knowing what that will mean, now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Egwene said quickly. Hastily she
undressed and folded her clothes, then set them on top of the pouch
and the papers. It would have to do.</p>

<p>Beside the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, Alanna suddenly
spoke. &ldquo;There is some sort of&mdash;resonance.&rdquo; She never took her
eyes from the arches. &ldquo;An echo, almost. I do not know from
where.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there a problem?&rdquo; Sheriam asked sharply. She
sounded surprised, too. &ldquo;I will not send a woman in there if there
is any problem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene looked yearningly at her piled clothes. <em>
Please, yes, Light, a problem. Something that will let me hide
those papers without refusing to enter</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Alanna said. &ldquo;It is like having a biteme buzz
&rsquo;round your head when you&rsquo;re trying to think, but it does not
interfere. I would not have mentioned it, only it has never
happened before that I ever heard.&rdquo; She shook her head. &ldquo;It is gone
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Elaida said dryly, &ldquo;others thought such a
small thing was not worth mentioning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us go on.&rdquo; Sheriam&rsquo;s tone would not put up with
any more distractions. &ldquo;Come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a last glance at her clothes and the hidden
papers, Egwene followed her toward the arches. The stone felt like
ice under her bare feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whom do you bring with you, Sister?&rdquo; Elaida
intoned.</p>

<p>Continuing her measured pace, Sheriam replied, &ldquo;One
who comes as a candidate for Acceptance, Sister.&rdquo; The three Aes
Sedai around the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> did not move.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she ready?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is ready to leave behind what she was, and,
passing through her fears, gain Acceptance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does she know her fears?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has never faced them, but now is willing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let her face what she fears.&rdquo; Even in its
formality, there was a note of satisfaction in Elaida&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first time,&rdquo; Sheriam said, &ldquo;is for what was. The
way back will come but once. Be steadfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene took a deep breath and stepped forward,
through the arch and into the glow. Light swallowed her whole.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">&ldquo;Jaim Dawtry dropped by. There&rsquo;s odd news down from
Baerlon with the peddler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene raised her head from the cradle she was
rocking. Rand was standing in the doorway. For an instant her head
spun. She looked from Rand&mdash;<em>my husband</em>&mdash;to the
child in the cradle&mdash;<em>my daughter</em>&mdash;and back
again, in wonder.</p>

<p><em>The way back will come but once. Be
steadfast</em>.</p>

<p>It was not her own thought, but a disembodied voice
that could have been inside her head or out, male or female, yet
emotionless and unknowable. Somehow, it did not seem strange to
her.</p>

<p>The moment of wonder passed, and the only thing to
wonder about was why she had thought anything seemed out of round.
Of course Rand was her husband&mdash;her handsome, loving husband&mdash;and Joiya was her daughter&mdash;the most beautiful,
sweetest little girl in the Two Rivers. Tam, Rand&rsquo;s father, was out
with the sheep, supposedly so Rand could work on the barn but
really so he could have more time to play with Joiya. This
afternoon Egwene&rsquo;s mother and father would come out from the
village. And probably Nynaeve, to see if motherhood was interfering
with Egwene&rsquo;s studies to replace Nynaeve as Wisdom one day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of news?&rdquo; she asked. She took up rocking
the cradle again, and Rand came over to grin down at the tiny child
wrapped in swaddling cloches. Egwene laughed softly to herself. He
was so taken with his daughter that he did not hear what people
said to him half the time. &ldquo;Rand? What kind of news? Rand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; His grin faded. &ldquo;Strange news. War. There&rsquo;s
some big war, taking up most of the world, so Jaim claims.&rdquo; That
was strange news; word of wars seldom reached the Two Rivers till
the wars were long done. &ldquo;He says everybody is fighting some folk
called the Shawkin, or the Sanchan, or something like that. I never
heard of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene knew&mdash;she thought she knew&mdash;Whatever it was, was gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing to upset
us here, my heart. Wars never touch the Two Rivers. We are too far
from everywhere for anyone to care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not upset. Did Jaim say anything else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing you can believe. He sounded like a Coplin.
He said the peddler told him these people use Aes Sedai in battle,
but then he claimed they offer a thousand gold marks to anyone who
turns an Aes Sedai over to them. And they kill anybody who hides
one. It makes no sense. Well, it&rsquo;s nothing to trouble us. It is all
a long way from here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aes Sedai. Egwene touched her head<em>. The way back
comes but once. Be steadfast</em>.</p>

<p>She noticed Rand had a hand to his own head. &ldquo;The
headaches?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>He nodded, his eyes suddenly tight. &ldquo;That powder
Nynaeve gave me doesn&rsquo;t seem to be working the last few days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hesitated. These headaches of his worried her.
They grew worse every time they came, now. And worst of all was
something she had not noticed at first, something she almost wished
she never had noticed. When Rand&rsquo;s head hurt, strange things
happened soon after. Lightning out of a clear sky, smashing to bits
that huge oak stump he had been working two days to root out where
he and Tam were clearing new field. Storms that Nynaeve did not
hear coming when she listened to the wind. Wildfires in the forest.
And the deeper his pain grew, the worse what followed. No one else
had connected these things to Rand, not even Nynaeve, and Egwene
was grateful for that. She did not want to think about what it
might mean.</p>

<p><em>That is plain stupid foolish</em>, she told
herself. <em>I must know if I am going to help him</em>. Because
she had a secret of her own, one that frightened her even as she
tried to puzzle out what it meant. Nynaeve was teaching her the
herbs, teaching Egwene to follow her as Wisdom, one day. Nynaeve&rsquo;s
cures often worked in near miraculous fashion, wounds healed with
barely a scar, sick folk brought back from the edge of the grave.
But three times now, Egwene had cured someone Nynaeve had given up
for dead. Three times she had sat to hold a hand through the last
hour, and seen the person get up from a deathbed. Nynaeve had
questioned her closely on what she had done, what herbs she had
used, in what blending. Thus far, she had not found the courage to
admit that she had done nothing. <em>I must have done something.
Once might be chance, but three times</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>I have to
figure it out. I have to learn</em>. That set off a buzz in her
head, as though the words were echoing inside her skull. <em>If I
could do something for them, I can help my husband</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me try, Rand,&rdquo; she said. And as she stood,
through the open door, she saw a silver arch standing in front of
the house, an arch filled with white light. <em>The way back will
come but once. Be steadfast</em>. She took two steps toward the
door before she could stop herself.</p>

<p>She halted, looked back at Joiya gurgling in her
cradle, at Rand still pressing hand to his head and looking at her
as if wondering where she was going. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;No, this is
what I want. This is what I want! Why can&rsquo;t I have this, too?&rdquo; She
did not understand her own words. Of course, this was what she
wanted, and she had it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it you want, Egwene?&rdquo; Rand asked. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s
anything I can get, you know I will. If I can&rsquo;t get it, I&rsquo;ll make
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>The way back will come but once. Be
steadfast</em>.</p>

<p>She took another step, into the doorway. The silver
arch beckoned her. Something waited on the other side. Something
she wanted more than anything else in the world. Something she had
to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egwene, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a thump behind her. She looked over her
shoulder to see Rand on his knees, bowed and head cradled in his
hands. The pain had never hit him so hard. <em>What will come after
this?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Light!&rdquo; he panted. &ldquo;Light! Hurts! Light, it
hurts worse than ever! Egwene?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Be steadfast</em>.</p>

<p>It was waiting. Something she had to do. Had to. She
took a step. It was hard, harder than anything she had ever done in
her life. Outside, toward the arch. Behind her, Joiya was
laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egwene? Egwene, I can&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; He cut off with a
loud groan.</p>

<p><em>Steadfast</em>.</p>

<p>She stiffened her back and kept walking, but she
could not keep the tears from rolling down her cheeks. Rand&rsquo;s
groans built to a scream, drowning Joiya&rsquo;s laughter. From the
corner of her eye, Egwene saw Tam coming, running as hard as he
could.</p>

<p><em>He can&rsquo;t help</em>, she thought, and tears became
wracking sobs. <em>There is nothing he can do. But I could. I
could</em>.</p>

<p>She stepped into the light, and was consumed.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Trembling and sobbing, Egwene stepped out of the
arch, the same by which she had entered, memory cascading back with
Sheriam&rsquo;s face confronting her. Cold clear water washed away her
tears as Elaida slowly emptied a silver chalice over her head. Her
weeping went on; she did not think it would ever end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are washed clean,&rdquo; Elaida pronounced, &ldquo;of what
sin you may have done, and of those done against you. You are
washed clean of what crime you may have committed, and of those
committed against you. You come to us washed clean and pure, in
heart and soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Light</em>, Egwene thought as the water ran down
her body, <em>let it be so. Can water wash away what I did?</em>
&ldquo;Her name was Joiya,&rdquo; she told Sheriam between sobs. &ldquo;Joiya.
Nothing can be worth what I just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;what I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a price to become Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Sheriam
replied, but the sympathy was back in her eyes, stronger than
before. &ldquo;There is always a price.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it real? Did I dream it?&rdquo; Weeping swallowed what
she wanted to say. <em>Did I leave him to die? Did I leave my
baby?</em></p>

<p>Sheriam put an arm around her shoulders, began
guiding her around the circle of arches. &ldquo;Every woman I have ever
watched come out of there has asked that question. The answer is,
no one knows. It has been speculated that perhaps some of those who
do not come back chose to stay because they found a happier place,
and lived out their lives there.&rdquo; Her voice hardened. &ldquo;If it is
real, and they stayed from choice, then I hope the lives they live
are far from happy. I have no sympathy for any who run from their
responsibilities.&rdquo; The edge on her tone softened slightly. &ldquo;Myself,
I believe it is not real. But the danger is. Remember that.&rdquo; She
stopped in front of the next glow-filled arch. &ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shifting her feet, Egwene nodded, and Sheriam took
her arm away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The second time is for what is. The way back will
come but once. Be steadfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene trembled. <em>Whatever happens, it cannot be
worse than the last. It cannot be</em>. She stepped into the
glow.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">She stared down at her dress, blue silk sewn with
pearls, all dusty and torn. Her head came up, and she took in the
ruins of a great palace around her. The Royal Palace of Andor, in
Caemlyn. She knew that, and wanted to scream.</p>

<p><em>The way back will come but once. Be
steadfast</em>.</p>

<p>The world was not the way she wanted it, no way that
she could think of without wanting to cry, but all her tears had
been cried away long ago, and the world was as it was. Ruin was
what she expected to see.</p>

<p>Careless of making more rips in her dress but as
careful of sound as a mouse, she climbed one of the piles of rubble
and peered into the curving streets of the Inner City. As far as
she could see in every direction lay ruin and desolation, buildings
that looked as if they had been torn apart by madmen, thick plumes
of smoke rising from the fires still burning. There were people in
the streets, bands of armed men prowling, searching. And Trollocs.
The men shied away from the Trollocs, and the Trollocs snarled at
them and laughed, harsh guttural laughter. But they knew each
other, worked together.</p>

<p>A Myrddraal came striding down the street, its black
cloak swaying gently with its steps even when the wind gusted to
drive dust and rubbish past it. Men and Trollocs alike cowered
under its eyeless stare. &ldquo;Hunt!&rdquo; Its voice sounded like something
long dead crumbling. &ldquo;Do not stand there shivering! Find him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene slipped back down the pile of jumbled stones
as silently as she could.</p>

<p><em>The way back will come but once. Be
steadfast</em>.</p>

<p>She stopped, afraid the whisper had come from
Shadowspawn. In some way, though, she was sure it had not. Glancing
back over her shoulder, half fearful of seeing the Myrddraal
standing where she had just been, she hurried onward and into the
ruined palace, climbing over fallen timbers, squeezing between
heavy blocks of collapsed masonry as she made her way. Once she
stepped on a woman&rsquo;s arm, sticking out from under a mound of
plaster and bricks that had been an interior wall and perhaps part
of the floor above. She noticed the arm as little as she noticed
the Great Serpent ring on one finger. She had trained herself not
to see the dead buried in the refuse heap Trollocs and Darkfriends
had made of Caemlyn. She could do nothing for the dead.</p>

<p>Forcing her way through a narrow gap where part of
the ceiling had fallen, she found herself in a room half buried
under what had stood above it. Rand lay with a heavy beam pinning
him across the waist, his legs hidden beneath the stone blocks that
filled half the room. Dust and sweat coated his face. He opened his
eyes when she came near him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You came back.&rdquo; He forced the words out in a hoarse
rasp. &ldquo;I was afraid&mdash;No matter. You have to help me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sank wearily to the floor. &ldquo;I could lift that
beam easily with Air, but as soon as it moves, everything else will
come down on top of you. On top of both of us. I cannot manage all
of it, Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His laugh was bitter and painful, and cut off almost
as soon as it began. Fresh sweat glistened on his face, and he
spoke with an effort. &ldquo;I could shift the beam myself. You know
that. I could shift that and the stones above, all of them. But I
have to let go of myself to do it, and I can&rsquo;t trust that. I cannot
trust&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped, wheezing for breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not understand,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;Let go of
yourself? What can&rsquo;t you trust?&rdquo; <em>The way back will come but
once. Be steadfast</em>. She rubbed her hands roughly over her
ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The madness, Egwene. I am&mdash;actually&mdash;holding it&mdash;at bay.&rdquo; His gasping laugh made her skin prickle.
&ldquo;But it takes everything I have just to do that. If I let go, even
a little, even for an instant, the madness will have me. I won&rsquo;t
care what I do then. You have to help me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How, Rand! I&rsquo;ve tried everything I know. Tell me
how, and I will do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His hand flopped out, fell just short of a dagger
lying in the dust bare-bladed. &ldquo;The dagger,&rdquo; he whispered. His hand
made a painful journey back to his chest. &ldquo;Here. In the heart. Kill
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stared at him, at the dagger, as if they were
both poisonous serpents. &ldquo;No! Rand, I will not. I cannot! How could
you ask such a thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slowly his hand crept back toward the dagger. His
fingers came short again. He strained, moaning, brushed it with a
fingertip. Before he could try again, she kicked it away from him.
He collapsed with a sob.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me why,&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;Why would you ask me to&mdash;to murder you? I will Heal you, I will do anything to get
you out of there, but I cannot kill you. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They can turn me, Egwene.&rdquo; His breathing was so
tortured, she wished she could weep. &ldquo;If they take me&mdash;the
Myrddraal&mdash;the Dreadlords&mdash;they can turn me to the
Shadow. If madness has me, I cannot fight them. I won&rsquo;t know what
they are doing till it is too late. If there is even a spark of
life left when they find me, they can still do it. Please, Egwene.
For the love of the Light. Kill me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t, Rand. Light help me, I
cannot!&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>The way back will come but once. Be
steadfast</em>.</p>

<p>She looked over her shoulder, and a silver arch
filled with white light took up most of the open space among the
rubble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egwene, help me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Be steadfast</em>.</p>

<p>She stood and took a step toward the arch. It was
right there in front of her. One more step, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, Egwene. Help me. I can&rsquo;t reach it. For the
love of the Light, Egwene, help me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot kill you,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t. Forgive
me.&rdquo; She stepped forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;HELP ME, EGWENE!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Light burned her to ash.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Staggering, she stepped out of the arch, neither
noticing her nakedness nor caring. A shudder ran through her, and
she covered her mouth with both hands. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t, Rand,&rdquo; she
whispered. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t. Please forgive me.&rdquo; <em>Light help him.
Please, Light help Rand</em>.</p>

<p>Cold water poured over her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are washed clean of false pride,&rdquo; Elaida
intoned. &ldquo;You are washed clean of false ambition. You come to us
washed clean, in heart and soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the Red sister turned away, Sheriam gently took
Egwene&rsquo;s shoulders and guided her toward the last arch. &ldquo;One more,
child. One more, and it is done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said they could turn him to the Shadow,&rdquo; Egwene
mumbled. &ldquo;He said the Myrddraal and the Dreadlords could force
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sheriam missed a step, and looked around quickly.
Elaida was almost back to the table. The Aes Sedai surrounding the
<em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> stared at it, seeming lost to anything else.
&ldquo;An unpleasant thing to talk of, child,&rdquo; Sheriam said finally, and
softly. &ldquo;Come. One more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can they?&rdquo; Egwene insisted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Custom,&rdquo; Sheriam said, &ldquo;is not to speak of what
happens within the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. A woman&rsquo;s fears are her
own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sheriam sighed, glanced at the other Aes Sedai again,
then dropped her voice to a whisper and spoke swiftly. &ldquo;This is
something known only to a few, child, even in the Tower. You should
not learn it now, if ever, but I will tell you. There is&mdash;a
weakness in being able to channel. That we learn to open ourselves
to the True Source means that we can be opened to other things.&rdquo;
Egwene shuddered. &ldquo;Calm yourself, child. It is not so easily done.
It is a thing not done, so far as I know&mdash;Light send it has
not been done!&mdash;since the Trolloc Wars. It took thirteen
Dreadlords&mdash;Darkfriends who could channel&mdash;weaving the
flows through thirteen Myrddraal. You see? Not easily done. There
are no Dreadlords today. This is a secret of the Tower, child. If
others knew, we could never convince them they were safe. Only one
who can channel can be turned in this way. The weakness of our
strength. Everyone else is as safe as a fortress; only their own
deeds and will can turn them to the Shadow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thirteen,&rdquo; Egwene said in a tiny voice. &ldquo;The same
number who left the Tower. Liandrin, and twelve more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sheriam&rsquo;s face hardened. &ldquo;That is nothing for you to
dwell on. You will forget it.&rdquo; Her voice climbed to a normal
volume. &ldquo;The third time is for what will be. The way back will come
but once. Be steadfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene stared at the glowing arch, stared at some far
distance beyond it. <em>Liandrin and twelve others. Thirteen
Darkfriends who can channel. Light help us all</em>. She stepped
into the light. It filled her. It shone through her. It burned her
to the bone, seared her to the soul. She flashed incandescent in
the light. <em>Light help me!</em> There was nothing but the light.
And the pain.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Egwene stared into the standing mirror, and was not
sure whether she was more surprised by the ageless smoothness of
her face or the striped stole that hung around her neck. The stole
of the Amyrlin Seat.</p>

<p><em>The way back will come but once. Be
steadfast</em>.</p>

<p><em>Thirteen</em>.</p>

<p>She swayed, caught at the mirror and almost toppled
it and herself to the blue-tiled floor of her dressing chamber.
<em>Something is wrong</em>, she thought. The wrongness had nothing
to do with her sudden dizziness, or at least that was not what felt
wrong. It was something else. But she had no idea what.</p>

<p>There was an Aes Sedai at her elbow, a woman with
Sheriam&rsquo;s high cheekbones but dark hair and concerned brown eyes,
and the hand-wide stole of the Keeper on her shoulders. Not
Sheriam, though. Egwene had never seen her before; she was sure she
knew her as well as she knew herself. Haltingly, she put a name to
the woman. Beldeine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you ill, Mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Her stole is green. That means she was raised
from the Green Ajah. The Keeper always comes from the same Ajah as
the Amyrlin she serves. Which means if I&rsquo;m the Amyrlin</em>&mdash;<em>if?</em>&mdash;<em>then I was Green Ajah, too</em>. That
thought shook her. Not that she had been Green Ajah, but that she
had to reason it out. <em>Light, something is wrong with
me</em>.</p>

<p><em>The way back will come bu</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The voice in
her head trailed away to finish in a buzz.</p>

<p><em>Thirteen Darkfriends</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am well, Beldeine,&rdquo; Egwene said. The name felt
strange on her tongue; it felt as if she had been saying it for
years. &ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t keep them waiting.&rdquo; <em>Keep who waiting?</em>
She did not know, except that she felt infinitely sad about ending
that wait, endlessly reluctant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will be growing impatient, Mother.&rdquo; There was a
hesitation in Beldeine&rsquo;s voice, as if she felt the same reluctance
as Egwene, but for a different reason. Unless Egwene missed her
guess, behind that outer calm, Beldeine was terrified.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that case, we had best be about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beldeine nodded, then took a deep breath before
crossing the carpet to where her staff of office, topped with the
snowdrop White Flame of Tar Valon, stood propped beside the door.
&ldquo;I suppose we must, Mother.&rdquo; She took up the staff and opened the
door for Egwene, then hurried ahead so that they made a procession
of two, Keeper of the Chronicles leading the Amyrlin Seat.</p>

<p>Egwene noticed little of the corridors they took. All
her attention was directed inward. <em>What is the matter with me?
Why can&rsquo;t I remember? Why is so much of what I</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>
almost remember wrong?</em> She touched the seven-striped stole on
her shoulders. <em>Why am I half sure I&rsquo;m still a novice?</em></p>

<p><em>The way back will come but on</em>&mdash;This
time it ended abruptly.</p>

<p><em>Thirteen of the Black Ajah</em>.</p>

<p>She stumbled at that. It was a frightening thought,
but it chilled her to the marrow beyond fear. It felt&mdash;personal. She wanted to scream, to run and hide. She felt as if
they were after her. <em>Nonsense. The Black Ajah has been
destroyed</em>. That seemed an odd thought, too. Part of her
remembered something called the Great Purge. Part of her was sure
no such thing had happened.</p>

<p>Eyes fixed ahead, Beldeine had not noticed her
stumble. Egwene had to lengthen her stride to catch up. <em>This
woman is scared to her toenails. What in the Light is she taking me
to?</em></p>

<p>Beldeine stopped before tall, paired doors, their
dark wood each inlaid with a large silver Flame of Tar Valon. She
wiped her hands on her dress, as if they were suddenly sweaty,
before opening one door and leading Egwene up a straight ramp of
the same silver-streaked white stone that made Tar Valon&rsquo;s walls.
Even here it seemed to shine.</p>

<p>The ramp let into a large, circular room under a
domed ceiling at least thirty paces high. A raised platform ran
around the outer edge of the room, fronted by steps except where
this ramp and two others came out, spaced equally around the
circle. The Flame of Tar Valon lay centered in the floor,
surrounded by widening spirals of color, the colors of the seven
Ajahs. At the opposite side of the room from where the ramp
entered, a high-backed chair stood, heavy and ornately carved in
vines and leaves, painted in the colors of all the Ajahs.</p>

<p>Beldeine rapped her staff sharply on the floor. There
was a tremor in her voice. &ldquo;She comes. The Keeper of the Seals. The
Flame of Tar Valon. The Amyrlin Seat. She comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a rustle of skirts, shawled women on the
platform got up from their chairs. Twenty-one chairs in groupings
of three, each triad painted and cushioned in the same color as the
fringe on the shawls of the women who stood before them.</p>

<p><em>The Hall of the Tower</em>, Egwene thought as she
crossed the floor to her chair. The Amyrlin Seat&rsquo;s chair. <em>
That&rsquo;s all it is. The Hall of the Tower, and the Sitters for the
Ajahs. I&rsquo;ve been here thousands of times</em>. But she could not
remember one of them. <em>What am I doing in the Hall of the Tower?
Light, they&rsquo;ll skin me alive when they see</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She was not
sure what it was they would see, only that she prayed they did
not.</p>

<p><em>The way back will come but</em>&mdash;</p>

<p><em>The way back will</em>&mdash;</p>

<p><em>The way</em>&mdash;</p>

<p><em>The Black Ajah waits</em>. That, at least, was
whole. It came from everywhere. Why did no one else seem to hear
it?</p>

<p>Settling in the chair of the Amyrlin Seat&mdash;the
chair that was also the Amyrlin Seat&mdash;she realized she had no
idea what to do next. The other Aes Sedai had seated themselves
when she did, all but Beldeine, who stood beside her with the
staff, swallowing nervously. They all seemed to be waiting on
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Begin,&rdquo; she said finally.</p>

<p>It seemed to be enough. One of the Red Sitters stood.
Egwene was shocked to recognize Elaida. At the same time she knew
that Elaida was foremost of the Sitters for the Red, and her own
bitterest enemy. The look on Elaida&rsquo;s face as she stared across the
chamber made Egwene shiver inside. It was stern and cold&mdash;and
triumphant. It promised things best not thought of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring him in,&rdquo; Elaida said loudly.</p>

<p>From one of the ramps&mdash;not the one Egwene had
entered by&mdash;came the crunch of boots on stone. People
appeared. A dozen Aes Sedai surrounding three men, two of them
burly guards with the white teardrops of the Flame of Tar Valon on
their chests, tugging the chains in which the third stumbled as if
dazed.</p>

<p>Egwene jerked forward in her chair. The chained man
was Rand. Eyes half-closed, head sagging, he seemed nearly asleep,
moving only as the chains directed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This man,&rdquo; Elaida proclaimed, &ldquo;has named himself the
Dragon Reborn.&rdquo; There was a buzz of distaste, not as if the
listeners were surprised, but as though it were not something they
wanted to hear. &ldquo;This man has channeled the One Power.&rdquo; The buzz
was louder now, disgusted and tinged with fear. &ldquo;There is only one
penalty for this, known and recognized in every nation, but
pronounced only here, in Tar Valon, in the Hall of the Tower. I
call on the Amyrlin Seat to pronounce the sentence of gentling on
this man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elaida&rsquo;s eyes glittered at Egwene. <em>Rand. What do
I do? Light, what do I do?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you hesitate?&rdquo; Elaida demanded. &ldquo;The sentence
has been set down for three thousand years. Why do you hesitate,
Egwene al&rsquo;Vere?&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the Green Sitters was on her feet, anger
bright through her calm. &ldquo;Shame, Elaida! Show respect for the
Amyrlin Seat! Show respect for the Mother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Respect,&rdquo; Elaida answered coldly, &ldquo;can be lost as
well as won. Well, Egwene? Can it be you show your weakness, your
unfitness for your office, at last? Can it be you will not
pronounce sentence on this man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand tried to lift his head and failed.</p>

<p>Egwene struggled to her feet, head spinning, trying
to remember she was the Amyrlin Seat with the power to command all
these women, screaming that she was a novice, that she did not
belong here, that something was dreadfully wrong. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said
shakily. &ldquo;No, I cannot! I will not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She betrays herself?&rdquo; Elaida&rsquo;s shout drowned out
Egwene&rsquo;s attempt to speak. &ldquo;She condemns herself out of her own
mouth! Take her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Egwene opened her mouth, Beldeine moved beside
her. Then the Keeper&rsquo;s staff struck her head.</p>

<p>Blackness.</p>

<p>First there was pain in her head. There was something
hard under her back, and cold. Next came the voices. Murmurs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she still unconscious?&rdquo; It was a rasp, a file on
bone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not worry,&rdquo; a woman said from far, far away. She
sounded uneasy, afraid, and trying not to show either. &ldquo;She will be
dealt with before she knows what is happening to her. Then she is
ours, to do with as we will. Perhaps we will give her to you for
sport.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After you make your own use of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The distant voices moved further away.</p>

<p>Her hand brushed against her leg, touched bare,
pebbly flesh. She opened her eyes a crack. She was naked, bruised,
lying on a rough wooden table, in what seemed to be a disused
storeroom. Splinters stuck her back. There was a metallic taste of
blood in her mouth.</p>

<p>A cluster of Aes Sedai stood to one side of the room,
talking among themselves, voices low yet urgent. The pain in her
head made thinking difficult, but it seemed important to count
them. Thirteen.</p>

<p>Another group, black-cloaked and hooded men, joined
the Aes Sedai, who seemed caught between cowering and trying to
dominate with their presence. One of the men turned his head to
look toward the table. The dead white face within the hood had no
eyes.</p>

<p>Egwene had no need to count the Myrddraal. She knew.
Thirteen Myrddraal, and thirteen Aes Sedai. Without another
thought, she screamed in pure terror. Yet even in the midst of fear
that tried to split her bones, she reached out for the True Source,
clawed desperately for <em>saidar</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s awake!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She cannot be! Not yet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shield her! Quickly! Quickly! Cut her off from the
Source!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late! She is too strong!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seize her! Hurry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hands reached for her arms and legs. Pasty pale hands
like slugs under rocks, ordered by minds behind pale, eyeless
faces. If those hands touched her flesh, she knew she would go mad.
The Power filled her.</p>

<p>Flames burst from Myrddraal skin, ripping through
black cloth as if they were solid daggers of fire. Shrieking
Halfmen crisped and burned like oiled paper. Fist-sized chunks of
stone tore themselves free of the walls and whizzed across the
room, producing shrieks and grunts as they thudded into flesh. The
air stirred, shifted, howled into a whirlwind.</p>

<p>Slowly, painfully, Egwene pushed herself off the
table. The wind whipped her hair and made her stagger, but she
continued to drive it as she stumbled toward the door. An Aes Sedai
loomed in front of her, a woman bruised and bleeding, surrounded by
the glow of the Power. A woman with death in her dark eyes.</p>

<p>Egwene&rsquo;s mind put a name to the face. Gyldan.
Elaida&rsquo;s closest confidante, always whispering together in corners,
closeting themselves in the night. Egwene&rsquo;s mouth tightened.
Disdaining stones and wind, she balled up her fist and punched
Gyldan between the eyes as hard as she could. The Red sister&mdash;the <em>Black</em> sister&mdash;crumpled as if her bones had
melted.</p>

<p>Rubbing her knuckles, Egwene staggered out into the
hall. <em>Thank you, Perrin</em>, she thought, <em>for showing me
how to do that. But you didn&rsquo;t tell me how much it hurts when you
do</em>.</p>

<p>Shoving the door shut against the wind, she
channeled. Stones around the doorway shivered, cracked, settled
against the wood. It would not hold them for long, but anything
that slowed pursuit for even a minute was worth doing. Minutes
might mean life. Gathering her strength, she forced herself to
break into a run. It wobbled, but at least it was a run.</p>

<p>She must find some clothes, she decided. A woman
clothed had more authority than the same woman naked, and she was
going to need every bit of authority. They would look for her first
in her rooms, but she had a spare dress and shoes in her study&mdash;and another stole&mdash;and that lay not far off.</p>

<p>It was unnerving, trotting through empty hallways.
The White Tower no longer held the numbers it once had, but there
was usually someone about. The loudest sound was the slap of her
bare soles on the tiles.</p>

<p>She hurried through the antechamber of her study to
the inner room, and at last she found someone. Beldeine was sitting
on the floor, head in her hands weeping.</p>

<p>Egwene stopped warily, as Beldeine raised reddened
eyes to meet hers. No glow of <em>saidar</em> surrounded the
Keeper, but Egwene was still cautious. And confident. She could not
see her own glow, of course, but the power&mdash;the Power&mdash;surging
through her was enough. Especially when added to her secret.</p>

<p>Beldeine scrubbed a hand across tearstained cheeks.
&ldquo;I had to. You must understand. I had to. They&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;They&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;
She took a deep, shuddering breath; it all came out in a rush.
&ldquo;Three nights ago they took me while I slept and stilled me.&rdquo; Her
voice rose to a near shriek. &ldquo;They <em>stilled</em> me! I cannot
channel any longer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light,&rdquo; Egwene breathed. The rush of <em>saidar</em>
cushioned her against the shock. &ldquo;The Light help and comfort you,
my daughter. Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me? I would have&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She let it
trail away, knowing there was nothing she could do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would you have done?&mdash;What? Nothing!
There&rsquo;s nothing you can do. But they said they could give it back
to me, with the power of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the power of the Dark One.&rdquo; Her eyes
squeezed shut, leaking tears. &ldquo;They hurt me, Mother, and they made
me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Oh, Light, they hurt me! Elaida told me they would make me
whole again, make me able to channel again, if I obeyed. That&rsquo;s why
I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I had to!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So Elaida <em>is</em> Black Ajah,&rdquo; Egwene said
grimly. A narrow wardrobe stood against the wall, and in it hung a
green silk dress, kept for when she had no time to return to her
rooms. A striped stole hung beside the dress. She began to dress
herself, quickly. &ldquo;What have they done with Rand? Where have they
taken him? Answer me, Beldeine! Where is Rand al&rsquo;Thor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beldeine huddled, lips trembling, eyes turned bleakly
inward, but finally she roused herself enough to say, &ldquo;The
Traitor&rsquo;s Court, Mother. They took him to the Traitor&rsquo;s Court.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shivers assaulted Egwene. Shivers of fear. Shivers of
rage. Elaida had not waited, not even an hour. The Traitor&rsquo;s Court
was used for only three purposes: executions, the stilling of an
Aes Sedai, or the gentling of a man who could channel. But all of
the three took an order from the Amyrlin Seat. <em>So who wears the
stole out there?</em> Elaida, she was sure. <em>But how could she
make them accept her so quickly, with me not tried, not sentenced?
There cannot be another Amyrlin until I&rsquo;ve been stripped of stole
and staff. And they&rsquo;ll not find that easy to do. Light! Rand!</em>
She started for the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can you do, Mother?&rdquo; Beldeine cried. &ldquo;What can
you do?&rdquo; It was not clear whether she meant for Rand or for
herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than anyone suspects,&rdquo; Egwene said. &ldquo;I never
held the Oath Rod, Beldeine.&rdquo; Beldeine&rsquo;s gasp followed her from the
room.</p>

<p>Egwene&rsquo;s memory still played hide-and-seek with her.
She knew no woman could achieve the shawl and the ring without
pledging the Three Oaths with the Oath Rod firmly in hand, the <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em> sealing her to keep those oaths as if they had
been engraved on her bones at birth. No woman became Aes Sedai
without being bound to them. Yet she knew that somehow, in some
fashion she could not begin to dredge up, she had done just
that.</p>

<p>Her shoes clicked swiftly as she ran. At least she
knew now why the halls were empty. Every Aes Sedai, except perhaps
those she had left in the storeroom, every Accepted, every novice,
even all the servants, would be gathered in the Traitor&rsquo;s Court,
according to custom, to watch the will of Tar Valon made fact.</p>

<p>And the Warders would be ringing the courtyard
against the possibility that someone might try to free the man to
be gentled. The remnants of Guaire Amalasan&rsquo;s armies had attempted
it, at the end of what some called the War of the Second Dragon,
just before Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s rise had given Tar Valon other things
to worry it, and so had Raolin Darksbane&rsquo;s followers, long years
earlier. Whether Rand had any followers or not, she could not
remember, but Warders remembered such things, and guarded against
them.</p>

<p>If Elaida, or another, truly did wear the stole of
the Amyrlin, the Warders might well not admit her to the Traitor&rsquo;s
Court. She knew she could force a way in. It would need to be done
quickly; there was no point if Rand was gentled while she was still
wrapping Warders in Air. Even Warders would break if she loosed the
lightnings on them, and balefire, and broke the ground under their
feet. <em>Balefire?</em> she wondered. But it would also do no good
if she broke Tar Valon&rsquo;s power to save Rand. She had to save
both.</p>

<p>Well short of the ways that led to the Traitor&rsquo;s
Court, she turned aside and climbed, up stairs and ramps that grew
narrower and tighter the higher she went, until she thrust open a
trapdoor and climbed out onto a sloping tower top, a roof of nearly
white tiles. From there, she could see across other roofs, past
other towers, into the broad open well of the Traitor&rsquo;s Court.</p>

<p>The court was crowded except for a cleared space in
the middle. People filled the windows overlooking it, crowded the
balconies and even the rooftops, but she could make out the lone
man, small at that distance, swaying in his chains in the center of
the cleared space. Rand. Twelve Aes Sedai surrounded him, and
another&mdash;who Egwene knew had to be wearing a seven-striped
stole, even though she could not distinguish it&mdash;stood before
Rand. Elaida. The words she must be saying crept into Egwene&rsquo;s
head.</p>

<p><em>This man, abandoned of the Light, has
touched</em> saidin, <em>the male half of the True Source. Thus do
we hold him. Most abominably has this man channeled the One Power,
knowing that</em> saidin <em>is tainted by the Dark One, tainted
for men&rsquo;s pride, tainted for men&rsquo;s sin. Thus do we chain
him</em>.</p>

<p>Forcefully, Egwene pushed the rest of it out of her
thoughts. <em>Thirteen Aes Sedai. Twelve sisters and the Amyrlin,
the traditional number for gentling. The same number as for</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She rid herself of that, too. She had no time for anything but
what she was there to do. If she could only manage to reason out
how.</p>

<p>At that distance, she thought she could manage to
lift him with Air. Pick him right out of the circle of Aes Sedai
and float him straight to her. Maybe. Even if she could find the
strength, even if she did not drop him to his death halfway, it
would be a slow process, with him a helpless target for archers,
and the glow of <em>saidar</em> pointing out her own position for
any Aes Sedai who looked. Any Myrddraal, for that matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light,&rdquo; she muttered, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no other way short of
starting a war inside the White Tower. And I may do that anyway.&rdquo;
She gathered the Power, separated skeins, directed flows.</p>

<p><em>The way back will come but once. Be
steadfast</em>.</p>

<p>It had been so long since she last heard those words
that she gave a start, slipped on the smooth tiles, barely caught
herself short of the edge. The ground lay a hundred paces down. She
looked over her shoulder.</p>

<p>There on the tower top, tilted to sit flat against
the sloping tiles, was a silver arch filled with a glowing light.
The arch flickered and wavered; streaks of angry red and yellow
darted through the white light.</p>

<p><em>The way back will come but once. Be
steadfast</em>.</p>

<p>The archway thinned to transparency, grew solid
again.</p>

<p>Frantic, Egwene gazed toward the Traitor&rsquo;s Court.
There had to be time. There had to be. All she needed was a few
minutes, perhaps ten, and luck.</p>

<p>Voices bored into her head, not the disembodied,
unknowable voice that warned her to be steadfast, but women&rsquo;s
voices she almost believed she knew.</p>

<p>&mdash;<em>can&rsquo;t hold much longer. If she does not
come out now</em>&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Hold! Hold, burn you, or I&rsquo;ll gut you all like
sturgeons!</em></p>

<p>&mdash;<em>going wild, Mother! We can&rsquo;t</em>&mdash;</p>

<p>The voices faded to a drone, the drone to silence,
but the unknowable spoke again.</p>

<p><em>The way back will come but once. Be
steadfast</em>.</p>

<p><em>There is a price to be Aes Sedai</em>.</p>

<p><em>The Black Ajah waits</em>.</p>

<p>With a scream of rage, of loss, Egwene threw herself
at the arch as it shimmered like a heat haze. She almost wished she
would miss and plunge to her death.</p>

<p>Light plucked her apart fiber by fiber, sliced the
fibers to hairs, split the hairs to wisps of nothing. All drifted
apart on the light. Forever.</p>
