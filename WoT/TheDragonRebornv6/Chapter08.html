<h4><em>Jarra</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">G</span>ray
stone houses with slate roofs lay clustered
along the few narrow streets of Jarra, clinging to a hillside above
a little stream spanned by a low wooden bridge. The muddy streets
were empty, and so was the sloping village green, except for one
man sweeping the steps of the village&rsquo;s only inn, standing beside
its stone stable; but it looked as if there had been a good many
people on the green not long before. Half a dozen arches, woven of
green branches and dotted with such few flowers as could be found
this early in the year, stood in a circle in the middle of the
grass. The ground had a trampled look, and there were other signs
of a gathering; a woman&rsquo;s red scarf lying tangled at the foot of
one of the arches, a child&rsquo;s knitted cap, a pewter pitcher tumbled
on its side, a few half-eaten scraps of food.</p>

<p>The aromas of sweet wine and spiced cakes clung about
the green, mixed in with smoke from dozens of chimneys and evening
meals cooking. For an instant Perrin&rsquo;s nose caught another odor,
one he could not identify, a faint trail that raised the hair on
the back of his neck with its vileness. Then it was gone. But he
was sure something had passed that way, something&mdash;wrong. He
scrubbed at his nose as if to rub away the memory of it. <em>That
can&rsquo;t be Rand. Light, even if he</em> has <em>gone mad, that can&rsquo;t be him.
Can it?</em></p>

<p>A painted sign hung above the inn door, a man
standing on one foot with his arms thrown in the air: Hardin&rsquo;s
Leap. As they drew rein in front of the square stone building, the
sweeper straightened, yawning fiercely. He gave a start at Perrin&rsquo;s
eyes, but his own already protruding eyes went wide when they fell
on Loial. With his wide mouth and no chin to speak of, he looked
something like a frog. There was an old smell of sour wine about
him&mdash;to Perrin, at least. The fellow had certainly been part
of the celebration.</p>

<p>The man gave himself a shake, and turned it into a
bow with one hand resting on the double row of wooden buttons
running down his coat. His eyes flickered from one to another of
them, popping even more every time they rested on Loial. &ldquo;Welcome,
good mistress, and the Light illumine your way. Welcome, good
masters. You wish food, rooms, baths? All to be had, here at the
Leap. Master Harod, the innkeeper, keeps a good house. I am called
Simion. If you wish anything, ask for Simion, and he will get it
for you.&rdquo; He yawned again, covering his mouth in embarrassment and
bowing to hide it. &ldquo;I beg your pardon, good mistress. You have come
far? Have you word of the Great Hunt? The Hunt for the Horn of
Valere? Or the false Dragon? It&rsquo;s said there&rsquo;s a false Dragon in
Tarabon. Or maybe Arad Doman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have not come that far,&rdquo; Lan said, swinging down
from his saddle. &ldquo;No doubt you know more than I.&rdquo; They all began
dismounting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have had a wedding here?&rdquo; Moiraine said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A wedding, good mistress? Why, we&rsquo;ve had a lifetime
of weddings. A plague of them. All in the last two days. There
isn&rsquo;t a woman old enough to speak the betrothal remains unmarried,
not in the whole village, not for a mile in any direction. Why,
even Widow Jorath dragged old Banas through the arches, and they&rsquo;d
both sworn they&rsquo;d never marry again. It was like a whirlwind just
snatched everybody up. Rilith, the weaver&rsquo;s daughter, she started
it, asking Jon the blacksmith to marry her, and him old enough to
be her father and more. The old fool just took off his apron and
said yes, and she demanded the arches be put up right then and
there. Wouldn&rsquo;t hear of a proper wait, and all the other women
sided with her. Since then we&rsquo;ve had marriages day and night. Why,
nobody&rsquo;s had any sleep at all hardly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very interesting,&rdquo; Perrin said when Simion
paused to yawn again, &ldquo;but have you seen a young&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very interesting,&rdquo; Moiraine said, cutting him
off, &ldquo;and I would hear more of it later, perhaps. For now, we would
like rooms, and a meal.&rdquo; Lan made a small gesture toward Perrin,
down low, as if telling him to hold his tongue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, good mistress. A meal. Rooms.&rdquo; Simion
hesitated, eyeing Loial. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to push two beds together
for&mdash;&rdquo; He leaned closer to Moiraine and dropped his voice. &ldquo;Pardon,
good mistress, but&mdash;uh&mdash;what exactly&mdash;is he?
Meaning no disrespect,&rdquo; he added hastily.</p>

<p>He had not spoken softly enough, for Loial&rsquo;s ears
twitched irritably. &ldquo;I am an Ogier! What did you think I was? A
Trolloc?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Simion took a step back at the booming voice.
&ldquo;Trolloc, good&mdash;uh&mdash;master? Why, I&rsquo;m a grown man. I
don&rsquo;t believe in children&rsquo;s tales. Uh, did you say Ogier? Why,
Ogier are childr&mdash;I mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; In desperation,
he turned to bellow toward the stable next to the inn. &ldquo;Nico!
Patrim! Visitors! Come see to their horses!&rdquo; After a moment two
boys with hay in their hair tumbled out of the stable, yawning and
rubbing their eyes. Simion gestured to the steps, bowing, as the
boys gathered reins.</p>

<p>Perrin slung his saddlebags and blanketroll over his
shoulder and carried his bow as he followed Moiraine and Lan
inside, with Simion bowing and bobbing ahead of them. Loial had to
duck low under the lintel, and the ceiling inside only cleared his
head by a foot. He kept rumbling to himself about not understanding
why so few humans remembered the Ogier. His voice was like distant
thunder. Even Perrin, right in front of him, could only understand
half of his words.</p>

<p>The inn smelled of ale and wine, cheese and
weariness, and the aroma of roasting mutton drifted from somewhere
in the back. The few men in the common room sagged over their mugs
as if they would really like to lie down on the benches and go to
sleep. One plump serving woman was drawing a mug of ale from one of
the barrels at the end of the room. The innkeeper himself, in a
long white apron, sat on a tall stool in the corner, leaning
against the wall. As the newcomers entered, he lifted his head,
bleary-eyed. His jaw dropped at the sight of Loial.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Visitors, Master Harod,&rdquo; Simion announced. &ldquo;They
want rooms. Master Harod? He&rsquo;s an Ogier, Master Harod.&rdquo; The serving
woman turned and saw Loial, and dropped the mug with a clatter.
None of the weary men at the tables even looked up. One had put his
head down on the table and was snoring.</p>

<p>Loial&rsquo;s ears twitched violently.</p>

<p>Master Harod got to his feet slowly, eyes fastened on
Loial, smoothing his apron all the while. &ldquo;At least he isn&rsquo;t a
Whitecloak,&rdquo; he said at last, then gave a start as if surprised he
had spoken aloud. &ldquo;That is to say, welcome, good mistress. Good
masters. Forgive my lack of manners. I can only plead tiredness,
good mistress.&rdquo; He darted another glance at Loial, and mouthed
&ldquo;Ogier?&rdquo; with a look of disbelief.</p>

<p>Loial opened his mouth, but Moiraine forestalled him.
&ldquo;As your man said, good innkeeper, I wish rooms for my party for
the night, and a meal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! Of course, good mistress. Of course. Simion,
show these good people to my best rooms, so they can put down their
belongings. I&rsquo;ll have a fine meal laid out for you when you return,
good mistress. A fine meal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it pleases you to follow me, good mistress,&rdquo;
Simion said. &ldquo;Good masters.&rdquo; He bowed the way to stairs at one side
of the common room.</p>

<p>Behind them, one of the men at the tables suddenly
exclaimed, &ldquo;What in the name of the Light is that?&rdquo; Master Harod
began explaining about Ogier, making it sound as if he were quite
familiar with them. Most of what Perrin heard before they left the
voices behind was wrong. Loial&rsquo;s ears twitched without stop.</p>

<p>On the second floor, the Ogier&rsquo;s head came near to
brushing along the ceiling. The narrow corridor was growing dark,
with only the sharp light of sunset through a window next to the
door at the far end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Candles in the rooms, good mistress,&rdquo; Simion said.
&ldquo;I should have brought a lamp, but my head is still spinning from
all those weddings. I&rsquo;ll send someone up to light the fire, if you
wish. And you&rsquo;ll want wash water, of course.&rdquo; He pushed open a
door. &ldquo;Our best room, good mistress. We don&rsquo;t have many&mdash;not
many strangers, you see&mdash;but this is our best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the one next to it,&rdquo; Lan said. He had
Moiraine&rsquo;s blanketroll and saddlebags on his shoulder as well as
his own, and the bundle containing the Dragon banner, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, good master, that&rsquo;s not a very good room at all.
Narrow bed. Cramped. Meant for a servant, I suspect, as if we&rsquo;d
ever have anybody here who had a servant. Begging your pardon, good
mistress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will take it anyway,&rdquo; Lan said firmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simion,&rdquo; Moiraine said, &ldquo;does Master Harod dislike
the Children of the Light?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he does, good mistress. He didn&rsquo;t, but he
does. It isn&rsquo;t good policy, disliking the Children, not so close to
the border as we are. They come through Jarra all the time, like
there wasn&rsquo;t any border at all. But there was trouble, yesterday. A
fistful of trouble. And with the weddings going on, and all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happened, Simion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man looked at her sharply before answering.
Perrin did not think anyone else saw how sharply, in the dimness.
&ldquo;There was about twenty of them, come day before yesterday. No
trouble then. But yesterday&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Why, three of them up and
announced they weren&rsquo;t Children of the Light anymore. They took off
their cloaks and just rode away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan grunted. &ldquo;Whitecloaks swear for life. What did
their commander do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, he would have done something, you can be sure,
good master, but another of them announced he was off to find the
Horn of Valere. Anyway, still another said they should be hunting
the Dragon. That one said he was going to Almoth Plain when he
left. Then some of them started saying things to women in the
streets, things they shouldn&rsquo;t have, and grabbing at them. The
women were screaming, and Children yelling at the ones bothering
the women. I never saw such commotion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t any of you try to stop them?&rdquo; Perrin
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good master, you carry that axe like you know how to
use it, but it isn&rsquo;t so easy to face up to men with swords and
armor and all, when all you know how to use is a broom or a hoe.
The rest of the Whitecloaks, those as hadn&rsquo;t gone off, put an end
to it. Almost came to drawing swords. And that wasn&rsquo;t the worst.
Two more just went mad&mdash;if the others weren&rsquo;t. Those two
started raving that Jarra was full of Darkfriends. They tried to
burn the village down&mdash;said they would!&mdash;beginning with
the Leap. You can see the burn marks out back, where they got it
started. Fought the other Whitecloaks when they tried to stop them.
The Whitecloaks that were left, they helped us put it out, tied
those two up tight, and rode out of here, back toward Amadicia.
Good riddance, I say, and if they never come back, it&rsquo;ll be too
soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rough behavior,&rdquo; Lan said, &ldquo;even for
Whitecloaks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Simion bobbed his head in agreement. &ldquo;As you say,
good master. They never acted like that before. Swagger around,
yes. Look at you like you were dirt, and poke their noses in where
they hadn&rsquo;t any business. But they never caused trouble before. Not
like that, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are gone now,&rdquo; Moiraine said, &ldquo;and troubles
with them. I am sure we will pass a quiet night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin kept his mouth shut, but he was not quiet
inside. <em>All these weddings and Whitecloaks are all very well, but
I&rsquo;d sooner know if Rand stopped here, and which way he went when he
left. That smell couldn&rsquo;t have been him</em>.</p>

<p>He let Simion guide him on down the hall to another
room, with two beds and a washstand, a pair of stools and not much
else. Loial stooped to put his head through the doorway. Only a
little light came in by the narrow windows. The beds were big
enough, with blankets and comforters folded at the foot, but the
mattresses looked lumpy. Simion fumbled on the mantel above the
fireplace until he found a candle, and a tinderbox to get it
alight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see about getting some beds put together for
you, good&mdash;uh&mdash;Ogier. Yes, just a moment, now.&rdquo; He
showed no sign of hurry to be about it, though, fussing with the
candlestick as if he had to place it just right. Perrin thought he
looked uneasy.</p>

<p><em>Well, I&rsquo;d be more than uneasy if Whitecloaks had
been acting like that in Emond&rsquo;s Field</em>. &ldquo;Simion, has another
stranger passed through here in the last day or two? A young man,
tall, with gray eyes and reddish hair? He might have played the
flute for a meal or a bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember him, good master,&rdquo; Simion said, still
shifting the candlestick. &ldquo;Came yesterday morning, early. Looked
hungry, he did. He played the flute for all the weddings,
yesterday. Good-looking young fellow. Some of the women eyed him,
at first, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He paused, looking at Perrin sideways. &ldquo;Is he
a friend of yours, good master?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know him,&rdquo; Perrin said. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Simion hesitated. &ldquo;No reason, good master. He was an
odd fellow, that&rsquo;s all. He talked to himself, sometimes, and
sometimes he laughed when nobody had said anything. Slept in this
very room, last night, or part of it. Woke us all in the middle of
the night, yelling. It was just a nightmare, but he wouldn&rsquo;t stay
any longer. Master Harod didn&rsquo;t make much effort to talk him into
it, after all that noise.&rdquo; Simion paused again. &ldquo;He said something
strange when he left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Perrin demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said somebody was after him. He said&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; The
chinless man swallowed and went on more slowly. &ldquo;Said they&rsquo;d kill
him if he didn&rsquo;t go. &lsquo;One of us has to die, and I mean it to be
him.&rsquo; His very words.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did not mean us,&rdquo; Loial rumbled. &ldquo;We are his
friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, good&mdash;uh&mdash;good Ogier. Of
course, he didn&rsquo;t mean you. I&mdash;uh&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean to say
anything about a friend of yours, but I&mdash;uh&mdash;I&mdash;think he&rsquo;s sick. In the head, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will take care of him,&rdquo; Perrin said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why
we&rsquo;re following him. Which way did he go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; Simion said, bouncing on his toes. &ldquo;I
knew she could help as soon as I saw you. Which way? East, good
master. East, like the Dark One himself was on his heels. Do you
think she&rsquo;ll help me? Help my brother, that is? Noam&rsquo;s bad sick,
and Mother Roon says she can&rsquo;t do anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin kept his face expressionless, and bought a
little time to think by propping his bow in the corner and setting
his blanketroll and saddlebags on one of the beds. The problem was
that thinking did not help much. He looked at Loial, but found no
help there; consternation had the Ogier&rsquo;s ears drooping and his
long eyebrows hanging down on his cheeks. &ldquo;What makes you think she
can help your brother?&rdquo; <em>Stupid question! The right question is,
what does he mean to do about it?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I traveled to Jehannah, once, good master, and
I saw two&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;two women like her. I couldn&rsquo;t mistake her after
that.&rdquo; His voice dropped to a whisper. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s said <em>they</em> can
raise the dead, good master.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who else knows this?&rdquo; Perrin asked sharply, and at
the same time Loial said, &ldquo;If your brother is dead, there is
nothing anyone can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The frog-faced man looked from one to the other of
them anxiously, and his words came in a babble. &ldquo;No one knows but
me, good master. Noam isn&rsquo;t dead, good Ogier, only sick. I swear
nobody else could recognize her. Even Master Harod&rsquo;s never been
more than twenty miles from here in his life. He&rsquo;s so bad sick. I&rsquo;d
ask her myself, only my knees&rsquo;d be shaking so hard she couldn&rsquo;t
hear me talk. What if she took offense and called down lightning on
me? And what if I&rsquo;d been wrong? It isn&rsquo;t the kind of thing you
accuse a woman of without&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ooh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He raised
his hands, half in pleading, half as if to defend himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can make no promises,&rdquo; Perrin said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll
speak to her. Loial, why don&rsquo;t you keep Simion company till I&rsquo;ve
spoken to Moiraine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; the Ogier boomed. Simion gave a start
when Loial&rsquo;s hand swallowed his shoulder. &ldquo;He will show me my room,
and we will talk. Tell me, Simion, what do you know of trees?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;T-t-trees, g-good Ogier?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin did not wait any longer. He hurried back down
the dark hall and knocked on Moiraine&rsquo;s door, barely waiting for
her peremptory &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; before pushing in.</p>

<p>Half a dozen candles showed that the Leap&rsquo;s best room
was none too good, though the one bed had four tall posts
supporting a canopy, and the mattress looked less full of lumps
than Perrin&rsquo;s. There was a scrap of carpet on the floor, and two
cushioned chairs instead of stools. Other than that, it looked no
different from his room. Moiraine and Lan stood in front of the
cold hearth as if they had been discussing something, and the Aes
Sedai did not look pleased at being interrupted. The Warder&rsquo;s face
was as imperturbable as a carving.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand&rsquo;s been here, all right,&rdquo; Perrin started off.
&ldquo;That fellow Simion remembers him.&rdquo; Moiraine hissed through her
teeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were told to keep your mouth shut,&rdquo; Lan
growled.</p>

<p>Perrin squared his feet to face the Warder. That was
easier than facing Moiraine&rsquo;s glare. &ldquo;How could we find out whether
he had been here without asking questions? Tell me that. He left
last night, if you are interested, heading east. And he was
carrying on about somebody following him, trying to kill him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;East.&rdquo; Moiraine nodded. The utter calm of her voice
was at odds with her disapproving eyes. &ldquo;That is good to know,
though it had to be so if he is going to Tear. But I was fairly
certain he had been here even before I heard about the Whitecloaks,
and they made it a certainty. Rand is almost surely right about one
thing, Perrin. I cannot believe we are the only ones trying to find
him. And if they find out about us, they may well try to stop us.
We have enough to contend with trying to catch up to Rand without
that. You must learn to hold your tongue until I tell you to
speak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Whitecloaks?&rdquo; Perrin said incredulously. <em>
Hold my tongue? Burn me, if I will!</em> &ldquo;How could they tell you&mdash;? Rand&rsquo;s madness. It is <em>catching</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not his madness,&rdquo; Moiraine said, &ldquo;if he is far
enough gone yet to be called mad. Perrin, he is more strongly <em>
ta&rsquo;veren</em> than anyone since the Age of Legends. Yesterday, in
this village, the Pattern&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;moved, shaped itself around him
like clay shaped on a mold. The weddings, the Whitecloaks, these
were enough to say Rand had been here, for anyone who knew to
listen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin drew a long breath. &ldquo;And this is what we&rsquo;ll
find everywhere he&rsquo;s been? Light, if there are Shadowspawn after
him, they can track him as easily as we can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;Perhaps not. No one knows
anything about <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> as strong as Rand.&rdquo; For just a
moment she sounded vexed at not knowing. &ldquo;Artur Hawkwing was the
most strongly <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> of whom any writings remain. And
Hawkwing was in no way as strong as Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is said,&rdquo; Lan put in, &ldquo;that there were times when
people in the same room with Hawkwing spoke truth when they meant
to lie, made decisions they had not even known they were
contemplating. Times when every toss of the dice, every turn of the
cards, went his way. But only times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean you don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Perrin said. &ldquo;He could
leave a trail of weddings and Whitecloaks gone mad all the way to
Tear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean I know as much as there is to know,&rdquo; Moiraine
said sharply. Her dark-eyed gaze chastised Perrin like a whip. &ldquo;The
Pattern weaves finely around <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, and others can
follow the shape of those threads if they know where to look. Be
careful your tongue does not unravel more than you can know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In spite of himself Perrin hunched his shoulders as
if she were delivering real blows. &ldquo;Well, you had better be glad I
opened my mouth this time. Simion knows you&rsquo;re Aes Sedai. He wants
you to Heal his brother Noam of some sickness. If I hadn&rsquo;t talked
to him, he would never have worked up nerve enough to ask, but he
might have started talking among his friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan caught Moiraine&rsquo;s eye, and for a moment they
stared at one another. The Warder had the air about him of a wolf
about to leap. Finally, Moiraine shook her head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you wish. It is your decision.&rdquo; Lan sounded as if
he thought she had made the wrong one, but the tension left
him.</p>

<p>Perrin stared at them. &ldquo;You were thinking of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Simion couldn&rsquo;t tell anyone if he were dead, could he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will not die by my actions,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;But
I cannot, and will not, promise that it will always be so. We must
find Rand, and I will not fail in that. Is that spoken plainly
enough for you?&rdquo; Caught in her gaze, Perrin could make no answer.
She nodded as if his silence were answer enough. &ldquo;Now take me to
Simion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door to Loial&rsquo;s room stood open, spilling a pool
of candlelight into the hall. The two beds inside had been pushed
together, and Loial and Simion were seated on the edge of one. The
chinless man was staring up at Loial with his mouth open and an
expression of wonder on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, the <em>stedding</em> are wonderful,&rdquo; Loial
was saying. &ldquo;There is such peace there, under the Great Trees. You
humans may have your wars and strife, but nothing ever troubles the
<em>stedding</em>. We tend the trees and live in harmony&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He
trailed off when he saw Moiraine, with Lan and Perrin behind
her.</p>

<p>Simion scrambled to his feet, bowing and backing away
until he came up against the far wall. &ldquo;Uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;good mistress&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Even then, he continued bobbing like a toy on
a string.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Show me to your brother,&rdquo; Moiraine commanded, &ldquo;and I
will do what I can. Perrin, you will come, too, since this good man
spoke to you first.&rdquo; Lan lifted an eyebrow, and she shook her head.
&ldquo;If we all go, we might attract attention. Perrin can give me what
protection I need.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan nodded reluctantly, then gave Perrin a hard look.
&ldquo;See that you do, blacksmith. If any harm befalls her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; His
cold blue eyes finished the promise.</p>

<p>Simion snatched one of the candles and scurried into
the hallway, still bowing so the candlelight made their shadows
dance. &ldquo;This way&mdash;uh&mdash;good mistress. This way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beyond the door at the end of the hall, outside
stairs led down to a cramped alleyway between inn and stable. Night
shrank the candle to a flickering pinpoint. The half moon was up in
a star-flecked sky, giving more than enough light for Perrin&rsquo;s
eyes. He wondered when Moiraine would tell Simion he did not have
to keep bowing, but she never did. The Aes Sedai glided along,
clutching her skirts to keep them out of the mud, as though the
dark passage were a palace hall and she a queen. The air was
already cooling; nights still carried echoes of winter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This way.&rdquo; Simion led them back to a small shed
behind the stable and hurriedly unbarred the door. &ldquo;This way.&rdquo;
Simion pointed. &ldquo;There, good mistress. There. My brother.
Noam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The far end of the shed had been barred off with
slats of wood; hastily, by the rough look of it. A stout iron lock
in a hasp held shut a crude door of wooden slats. Behind those
bars, a man lay sprawled on his stomach on the straw-covered floor.
He was barefoot, his shirt and breeches ripped as if he had torn at
them without knowing how to take them off. There was an odor of
unwashed flesh that Perrin thought even Simion and Moiraine must
smell.</p>

<p>Noam lifted his head and stared at them silently,
without expression. There was nothing at all about him to suggest
he was Simion&rsquo;s brother&mdash;he had a chin, for one thing, and he
was a big man, with heavy shoulders&mdash;but that was not what
staggered Perrin. Noam stared at them with burnished golden
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d been talking crazy almost a year, good
mistress, saying he could&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;could talk with wolves. And his
eyes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Simion darted a glance at Perrin. &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;d talk
about it when he&rsquo;d drunk too much. Everybody laughed at him. Then a
month or so ago, he didn&rsquo;t come to town. I went out to see what was
the matter, and I found him&mdash;like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cautiously, unwillingly, Perrin reached out toward
Noam as he would have toward a wolf. <em>Running through the woods
with the cold wind in his nose. Quick dash from cover, teeth
snapping at hamstrings. Taste of blood, rich on the tongue.
Kill</em>. Perrin jerked back as he would have from a fire, sealed
himself off. They were not thoughts at all, really, just a chaotic
jumble of desires and images, part memory, part yearning. But there
was more wolf there than anything else. He put a hand to the wall
to steady himself; his knees felt weak. <em>Light help me!</em></p>

<p>Moiraine put a hand on the lock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Harod has the key, good mistress. I don&rsquo;t
know if he&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave a tug, and the lock sprang open. Simion
gaped at her. She lifted the lock free of the hasp, and the
chinless man turned to Perrin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that safe, good master? He&rsquo;s my brother, but he
bit Mother Roon when she tried to help, and he&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;he killed a
cow. With his teeth,&rdquo; he finished faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moiraine,&rdquo; Perrin said, &ldquo;the man is dangerous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All men are dangerous,&rdquo; she replied in a cool voice.
&ldquo;Now be quiet.&rdquo; She opened the door and went in. Perrin held his
breath.</p>

<p>At her first step, Noam&rsquo;s lips peeled back from his
teeth, and he began to growl, a rumble that deepened till his whole
body quivered. Moiraine ignored it. Still growling, Noam wriggled
backwards in the straw as she came closer to him, until he had
backed himself into a corner. Or she had backed him.</p>

<p>Slowly, calmly, the Aes Sedai knelt and took his head
between her hands. Noam&rsquo;s growl heightened to a snarl, then tailed
off in a whimper before Perrin could move. For a long moment
Moiraine held Noam&rsquo;s head, then just as calmly released it and
rose. Perrin&rsquo;s throat tightened as she turned her back on Noam and
walked out of the cage, but the man only stared after her. She
pushed the slatted door to, slipped the lock back through the hasp,
not bothering to snap it shut&mdash;and Noam hurled himself
snarling against the wooden bars. He bit at them, and battered them
with his shoulders, tried to force his head between them, all the
while snarling and snapping.</p>

<p>Moiraine brushed straw from her skirt with a steady
hand and no expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do take chances,&rdquo; Perrin breathed. She looked at
him&mdash;a steady, knowing gaze&mdash;and he dropped his eyes.
His yellow eyes.</p>

<p>Simion was staring at his brother. &ldquo;Can you help him,
good mistress?&rdquo; he asked hoarsely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry, Simion,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you do anything, good mistress? Something? One
of those&mdash;&rdquo; his voice fell to a whisper&mdash;&ldquo;Aes Sedai
things?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Healing is not a simple matter, Simion, and it comes
from within as much as from the Healer. There is nothing here that
remembers being Noam, nothing that remembers being a man. There are
no maps remaining to show him the path back, and nothing left to
take that path. Noam is gone, Simion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he just used to talk funny, good mistress,
when he&rsquo;d had too much to drink. He just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Simion scrubbed a
hand across his eyes and blinked. &ldquo;Thank you, good mistress. I know
you&rsquo;d have done something if you could.&rdquo; She put a hand on his
shoulder, murmured comforting words, and then she was gone from the
shed.</p>

<p>Perrin knew he should follow her, but the man&mdash;what had once been a man&mdash;snapping at the wooden bars, held
him. He took a quick step and surprised himself by removing the
dangling lock from the hasp. The lock was a good one, the work of a
master smith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good master?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin stared at the lock in his hand, at the man
behind in the cage. Noam had stopped biting at the slats; he stared
back at Perrin warily, panting. Some of his teeth had broken off
jaggedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can leave him in here forever,&rdquo; Perrin said,
&ldquo;but I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll ever get any better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he gets out, good master, he&rsquo;ll die!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will die in here or out there, Simion. Out there,
at least he&rsquo;ll be free, and as happy as he can be. He is not your
brother anymore, but you&rsquo;re the one who has to decide. You can
leave him in here for people to stare at, leave him to stare at the
bars of his cage until he pines away. You cannot cage a wolf,
Simion, not and expect it to be happy. Or live long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Simion said slowly. &ldquo;Yes, I see.&rdquo; He
hesitated, then nodded, and jerked his head toward the shed
door.</p>

<p>That was all the answer Perrin needed. He swung back
the slatted door and stood aside.</p>

<p>For a moment Noam stared at the opening. Abruptly he
darted out of the cage, running on all fours, but with surprising
agility. Out of the cage, out of the shed, and into the night. <em>
The Light help us both</em>, Perrin thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s better for him to be free.&rdquo; Simion
gave himself a shake. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know what Master Harod will say
when he finds that door standing open and Noam gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin shut the cage door; the big lock made a sharp
click as he refastened it. &ldquo;Let him puzzle that out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Simion barked a quick laugh, abruptly cut off. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
make something out of it. They all will. Some of them say Noam
turned into a wolf&mdash;fur and all!&mdash;when he bit Mother
Roon. It&rsquo;s not true, but they say it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shivering, Perrin leaned his head against the cage
door. <em>He may not have fur, but he&rsquo;s a wolf. He&rsquo;s wolf, not man.
Light, help me</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t keep him here always,&rdquo; Simion said
suddenly. &ldquo;He was at Mother Roon&rsquo;s house, but she and I got Master
Harod to move him here after the Whitecloaks came. They always have
a list of names, Darkfriends they&rsquo;re looking for. It was Noam&rsquo;s
eyes, you see. One of the names the Whitecloaks had was a fellow
named Perrin Aybara, a blacksmith. They said he has yellow eyes,
and runs with wolves. You can see why I didn&rsquo;t want them to know
about Noam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin turned his head enough to look at Simion over
his shoulder. &ldquo;Do you think this Perrin Aybara is a
Darkfriend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Darkfriend wouldn&rsquo;t care if my brother died in a
cage. I suppose she found you soon after it happened. In time to
help. I wish she&rsquo;d come to Jarra a few months ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin was ashamed that he had ever compared the man
to a frog. &ldquo;And I wish she could have done something for him.&rdquo; <em>
Burn me, I wish she could</em>. Suddenly it burst on him that the
whole village must know about Noam. About his eyes. &ldquo;Simion, would
you bring me something to eat in my room?&rdquo; Master Harod and the
rest might have been too taken with staring at Loial to notice his
eyes before, but they surely would if he ate in the common
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. And in the morning, too. You don&rsquo;t have
to come down until you are ready to get on your horse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a good man, Simion. A good man.&rdquo; Simion
looked so pleased that Perrin felt ashamed all over again.</p>
