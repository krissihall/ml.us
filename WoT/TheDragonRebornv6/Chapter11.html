<h4><em>Tar Valon</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
small village of Dairein had lain beside the
River Erinin almost as long as Tar Valon had occupied its island.
Dairein&rsquo;s small, red and brown brick houses and shops, its
stone-paved streets, gave a feel of permanence, but the village had
been burned in the Trolloc Wars, sacked when Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s
armies besieged Tar Valon, looted more than once during the War of
the Hundred Years, and put to the torch again in the Aiel War, not
quite twenty years before. An unquiet history for a little village,
but Dairein&rsquo;s place, at the foot of one of the bridges leading out
to Tar Valon, ensured it would always be rebuilt, however many
times it was destroyed. So long as Tar Valon stood, at least.</p>

<p>At first it seemed to Egwene that Dairein was
expecting war again. A square of pikemen marched along the streets,
ranks and files bristling like a carding comb, followed by bowmen
in flat, rimmed helmets, with filled quivers riding at their hips
and bows slanted across their chests. A squadron of armored
horsemen, faces hidden behind the steel bars of their helmets, gave
way to Verin and her party at a wave of their officer&rsquo;s gauntleted
hand. All wore the White Flame of Tar Valon, like a snowy teardrop,
on their breasts.</p>

<p>Yet townspeople went about their business with
apparent unconcern, the market throng dividing around the soldiers
as if marching men were obstructions they were long used to. A few
men and women carrying trays of fruit kept pace with the soldiers,
trying to interest them in wrinkled apples and pears pulled from
winter cellars, but aside from those few, shopkeepers and hawkers
alike paid the soldiers no mind. Verin seemingly ignored them, too,
as she led Egwene and the others through the village to the great
bridge, arching over half a mile or more of water like lace woven
from stone.</p>

<p>At the foot of the bridge more soldiers stood guard,
a dozen pikemen and half that many archers, checking everyone who
wanted to cross. Their officer, a balding man with his helmet
hanging on his sword hilt, looked harassed by the waiting line of
people afoot and on horseback, people with carts drawn by oxen or
horses or the owner. The line was only a hundred paces long, but
every time one was let onto the bridge, another joined the far end.
Just the same, the balding man seemed to be taking his time about
making sure each one had a right to enter Tar Valon before he let
them go.</p>

<p>He opened his mouth angrily when Verin led her party
to the head of the line, then caught a good look at her face and
hurriedly stuffed his helmet onto his head. No one who really knew
them needed a Great Serpent ring to identify Aes Sedai. &ldquo;Good
morrow to you, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; he said, bowing with a hand to his
heart. &ldquo;Good morrow. Go right across, if it please you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verin reined in beside him. A murmur rose from the
waiting line, but no one voiced a complaint aloud. &ldquo;Trouble from
the Whitecloaks, guardsman?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Why are we stopping?</em> Egwene wondered
urgently. &ldquo;Has she forgotten about Mat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not really, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; the officer said. &ldquo;No
fighting. They tried to move into Eldone Market, the other side of
the river, but we showed them better. The Amyrlin means to make
sure they don&rsquo;t try again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Verin Sedai,&rdquo; Egwene began carefully, &ldquo;Mat&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a moment, child,&rdquo; the Aes Sedai said, sounding
only halfway absent-minded. &ldquo;I have not forgotten him.&rdquo; Her
attention went right back to the officer. &ldquo;And the outlying
villages?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man shrugged uncomfortably. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t keep the
Whitecloaks out, Aes Sedai, but they move off when our patrols ride
in. They seem to be trying to goad us.&rdquo; Verin nodded, and would
have ridden on, but the officer spoke again. &ldquo;Pardon, Aes Sedai,
but you&rsquo;ve obviously come from a distance. Have you any news? Fresh
rumors come upriver with every trading vessel. They say there&rsquo;s a
new false Dragon out west somewhere. Why, they even say he has
Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s armies, back from the dead, following him, and
that he killed a lot of Whitecloaks and destroyed a city&mdash;Falme, they call it&mdash;in Tarabon, some say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say Aes Sedai helped him!&rdquo; a man&rsquo;s voice
shouted from the waiting line. Hurin breathed deeply, and shifted
himself as if he expected violence.</p>

<p>Egwene looked &rsquo;round, but there was no sign of
whoever had shouted. Everyone appeared to be concerned only with
waiting, patiently or impatiently, for their turn to cross. Things
had changed, and not for the better. When she had left Tar Valon,
any man who spoke against Aes Sedai would have been lucky to escape
with a punch in the nose from whoever overheard. Red in the face,
the officer was glaring down the line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rumors are seldom true,&rdquo; Verin told him. &ldquo;I can tell
you that Falme still stands. It isn&rsquo;t even in Tarabon, guardsman.
Listen less to rumor, and more to the Amyrlin Seat. The Light shine
on you.&rdquo; She lifted her reins, and he bowed as she led the others
past him.</p>

<p>The bridge struck Egwene with wonder, as the bridges
of Tar Valon always did. The openwork walls looked intricate enough
to tax the best craftswoman at her lace-frame. It hardly seemed
that such could have been done with stone, or that it could stand
even its own weight. The river rolled, strong and steady, fifty
paces or more below, and for all that half mile the bridge flowed
unsupported from riverbank to island.</p>

<p>Even more wondrous, in its own way, was the feeling
that the bridge was taking her home. More wondrous, and shocking.
<em>Emond&rsquo;s Field is my home</em>. But it was in Tar Valon that she
would learn what she must to keep her alive, to keep her free. It
was in Tar Valon that she would learn&mdash;must learn&mdash;why
her dreams disturbed her so, and why they sometimes seemed to have
meanings she could not puzzle out. Tar Valon was where her life was
tied, now. If she ever returned to Emond&rsquo;s Field&mdash;the &ldquo;if&rdquo;
hurt, but she had to be honest&mdash;if she returned, it would be
to visit, to see her parents. She had already gone beyond being an
innkeeper&rsquo;s daughter. Those bonds would not hold her again, either,
not because she hated them, but because she had outgrown them.</p>

<p>The bridge was only the beginning. It arched straight
to the walls that surrounded the island, high walls of gleaming
white, silver-streaked stone, whose tops looked down on the
bridge&rsquo;s height. At intervals, guard towers interrupted the walls,
of the same white stone, their massive footings washed by the
river. But above the walls and beyond rose the true towers of Tar
Valon, the towers of story, pointed spires and flutes and spirals,
some connected by airy bridges a good hundred paces or more above
the ground. And still only the beginning.</p>

<p>There were no guards on the bronze-clad gates, and
they stood wide enough for twenty abreast to ride through, opening
onto one of the broad avenues that crisscrossed the island. Spring
might barely have come, but the air already smelled of flowers and
perfumes and spices.</p>

<p>The city took Egwene&rsquo;s breath as if she had never
seen it before. Every square and street crossing had its fountain,
or its monument or statue, some atop great columns as high as
towers, but it was the city itself that dazzled the eye. What was
plain in form might have so many ornaments and carvings that it
seemed an ornament itself, or, lacking decoration, used its form
alone for grandeur. Great buildings and small, in stone of every
color, looking like shells, or waves, or wind-sculpted cliffs,
flowing and fanciful, captured from nature or the flights of men&rsquo;s
minds. The dwellings, the inns, the very stables&mdash;even the
most insignificant buildings in Tar Valon had been made for beauty.
Ogier stonemasons had built most of the city in the long years
after the Breaking of the World, and they maintained it had been
their finest work.</p>

<p>Men and women of every nation thronged the streets.
They were dark of skin, and pale, and everything in between, their
garments in bright colors and patterns, or drab, but decked with
fringes and braids and shining buttons, or stark and severe;
showing more skin than Egwene thought proper, or revealing nothing
but eyes and fingertips. Sedan chairs and litters wove through the
crowds, the trotting bearers crying &ldquo;Give way!&rdquo; Closed carriages
inched along, liveried coachmen shouting &ldquo;Hiya!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; as if
they believed they might achieve more than a walk. Street musicians
played flute or harp or pipes, sometimes accompanying a juggler or
an acrobat, always with a cap set out for coins. Wandering hawkers
cried their wares, and shopkeepers standing in front of their shops
shouted the excellence of their goods. A hum filled the city like
the song of a thing alive.</p>

<p>Verin had pulled her cowl back up, hiding her face.
No one seemed to be paying them any mind in these crowds, Egwene
thought. Not even Mat in his horse litter drew a second glance,
though some folk did edge away from it as they hurried past. People
sometimes brought their sick to the White Tower for Healing, and
whatever he had might be catching.</p>

<p>Egwene rode up beside Verin and leaned close. &ldquo;Do you
really expect trouble now? We are in the city. We are almost
there.&rdquo; The White Tower stood in plain sight now, the great
building gleaming broad and tall above the rooftops</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always expect trouble,&rdquo; Verin replied placidly,
&ldquo;and so should you. In the Tower most of all. You must all of you
be more careful than ever, now. Your&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;tricks&rdquo;&mdash;her mouth
tightened for an instant before serenity returned&mdash;&ldquo;frightened away the Whitecloaks, but inside the Tower they may
well bring you death or stilling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not do that in the Tower,&rdquo; Egwene protested.
&ldquo;None of us would.&rdquo; Nynaeve and Elayne had joined them, leaving
Hurin to mind the litter horses. They nodded, Elayne fervently, and
Nynaeve, it seemed to Egwene, as if she had reservations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should not do it ever again, child. You must
not! Ever!&rdquo; Verin eyed them sideways &rsquo;round the edge of her cowl,
and shook her head. &ldquo;And I truly hope you have learned the folly of
speaking when you should be silent.&rdquo; Elayne&rsquo;s face went crimson,
and Egwene&rsquo;s cheeks grew hot. &ldquo;Once we enter the Tower grounds,
hold your tongues and accept whatever happens. <em>Whatever</em>
happens! You know nothing of what awaits us in the Tower, and if
you did, you would not know how to handle it. So be silent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do as you say, Verin Sedai,&rdquo; Egwene said, and
Elayne echoed her. Nynaeve sniffed. The Aes Sedai stared at her,
and she nodded reluctantly.</p>

<p>The street opened into a vast square, centered in the
city, and in the middle of the square stood the White Tower,
shining in the sun, rising until it seemed to touch the sky from a
palace of domes and delicate spires and other shapes surrounded by
the Tower grounds. There were surprisingly few people in the
square. No one intruded on the Tower unless they had business
there, Egwene reminded herself uneasily.</p>

<p>Hurin led the horse litter forward as they entered
the square. &ldquo;Verin Sedai, I must leave you now.&rdquo; He eyed the Tower
once, then managed not to look at it again, though it was hard to
look at anything else. Hurin came from a land where Aes Sedai were
respected, but it was one thing to respect them and quite another
to be surrounded by them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been a great help on our journey, Hurin,&rdquo;
Verin told him, &ldquo;and a long journey it has been. There will be a
place in the Tower for you to rest before you travel on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hurin shook his head emphatically. &ldquo;I cannot waste a
day, Verin Sedai. Not another hour. I must return to Shienar, to
tell King Easar, and Lord Agelmar, the truth of what happened at
Falme. I must tell them about&mdash;&rdquo; He cut off abruptly and
looked around. There was no one close enough to overhear, but he
still lowered his voice and said only, &ldquo;About Rand. That the Dragon
is Reborn. There must be trading ships heading upriver, and I mean
to be on the next to sail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go in the Light, then, Hurin of Shienar,&rdquo; Verin
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light illumine all of you,&rdquo; he replied,
gathering his reins. Yet he hesitated a moment, then added, &ldquo;If you
need me&mdash;ever&mdash;send word to Fal Dara, and I&rsquo;ll find a
way to come.&rdquo; Clearing his throat as if embarrassed, he turned his
horse and trotted away, heading beyond the Tower. All too soon he
was lost to sight.</p>

<p>Nynaeve gave an exasperated shake of her head. &ldquo;Men!
They always say to send for them if you need them, but when you do
need one, you need him right then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No man can help where we are going now,&rdquo; Verin said
dryly. &ldquo;Remember. Be silent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene felt a sense of loss with Hurin&rsquo;s going. He
would barely talk to any of them, except Mat, and Verin was right.
He was only a man, and helpless as a babe when it came to facing
whatever might await them in the Tower. Yet his leaving made their
number one less, and she could never help thinking that a man with
a sword was useful to have around. And he had been a link to Rand,
and Perrin. <em>I have my own troubles to worry about</em>. Rand
and Perrin would have to make do with Moiraine to look after them.
<em>And Min will certainly look after Rand</em>, she thought with a
flash of jealousy that she tried to suppress. She almost
succeeded.</p>

<p>With a sigh, she took up the lead of the horse
litter. Mat lay bundled to his chin, his breathing was a dry rasp.
<em>Soon</em>, she thought. <em>You&rsquo;ll be Healed soon, now. And we&rsquo;ll find
out what&rsquo;s waiting for us</em>. She wished Verin would stop trying
to frighten them. She wished she did not think Verin had reason to
frighten them.</p>

<p>Verin took them around the Tower grounds to a small
side gate that stood open, with two guards. Pausing, the Aes Sedai
pushed back her cowl and leaned from her saddle to speak softly to
one of the men. He gave a start, and a surprised look at Egwene and
the others. With a quick, &ldquo;As you command, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; he took off
into the grounds at a run. Verin was already riding through the
gates as he spoke. She rode as if there were no hurry.</p>

<p>Egwene followed with the litter, exchanging glances
with Nynaeve and Elayne, wondering what Verin had told the man.</p>

<p>A gray stone guardhouse stood just inside the gate,
shaped like a six pointed star lying on its side. A small knot of
guards lounged in the doorway; the left off talking and bowed as
Verin rode past.</p>

<p>This part of the Tower grounds could have been some
lord&rsquo;s park, with trees and pruned shrubs and wide graveled paths.
Other buildings were visible through the trees, and the Tower
itself loomed over everything.</p>

<p>The path led them to a stableyard among the trees,
where grooms in leather vests came running to take their horses. At
the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s direction, some of the grooms unfastened the litter
and set it gently off to one side. As the horses were led away into
the stable, Verin took the leather sack from Mat&rsquo;s feet and tucked
it carelessly under one arm.</p>

<p>Nynaeve paused in knuckling her back and frowned at
the Aes Sedai. &ldquo;You said he has hours, perhaps. Are you just going
to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verin held up a hand, but whether it was the gesture
that stopped Nynaeve or the crunch of feet approaching on gravel,
Egwene could not say.</p>

<p>In a moment Sheriam Sedai appeared, followed by three
of the Accepted, their white dresses ringed at the hem with the
colors of all seven Ajahs from Blue to Red, and two husky men in
rough, laborer&rsquo;s coats. The Mistress of Novices was a slightly
plump woman, with the high cheekbones that were common in Saldaea.
Flame-red hair and clear, tilted green eyes made her smooth Aes
Sedai features striking. She eyed Egwene and the others calmly, but
her mouth was tight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you have brought back our three runaways, Verin.
With everything that happened, I could almost wish you had
not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We did not&mdash;&rdquo; Egwene began, but Verin cut her
off with a sharp, &ldquo;BE SILENT!&rdquo; Verin stared at her&mdash;at each
of the three of them&mdash;as if the intensity of her look could
hold their mouths shut.</p>

<p>Egwene was sure that, for her part, it could. She had
never seen Verin angry before. Nynaeve crossed her arms beneath her
breasts and muttered under her breath, but she said nothing. The
three Accepted behind Sheriam kept their silence, of course, but
Egwene thought she could see their ears grow from listening.</p>

<p>When she was certain Egwene and the others would
remain still, Verin turned back to Sheriam. &ldquo;The boy must be taken
somewhere away from everyone. He is ill, dangerously so. Dangerous
to others as well as to himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was told you had a litter to be carried.&rdquo; Sheriam
motioned the two men to the litter, spoke a quiet word to one, and
as quickly as that Mat was whisked away.</p>

<p>Egwene opened her mouth to say he needed help now,
but at Verin&rsquo;s stare, quick and furious, she closed it again.
Nynaeve was tugging her braid nearly hard enough to pull it out of
her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; Verin said, &ldquo;that the whole Tower knows
we have returned by now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those who do not know,&rdquo; Sheriam told her, &ldquo;will know
before much longer. Comings and goings have become the first topic
of conversation and gossip. Even before Falme, and far ahead of the
war in Cairhien. Did you think to keep it secret?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verin gathered the leather sack in both arms. &ldquo;I must
see the Amyrlin. Immediately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what of these three?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verin considered Egwene and her friends, frowning.
&ldquo;They must be closely held until the Amyrlin wishes to see them. If
she does wish to. Closely held, mind. Their own rooms will do, I
think. No need for cells. Not a word to anyone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verin was still speaking to Sheriam, but Egwene knew
the last had been meant as a reminder to her and the others.
Nynaeve&rsquo;s brows were drawn down, and she jerked at her braid as if
she wanted to hit something. Elayne&rsquo;s blue eyes were open wide, and
her face was even paler than usual. Egwene was not sure which
feelings she shared, anger or fear or worry. Some of all three, she
thought.</p>

<p>With a last, searching glance at her three traveling
companions, Verin hurried off, clutching the sack to her chest,
cloak flapping behind her. Sheriam put her fists on her hips and
studied Egwene and the other two. For a moment Egwene felt a
lessening of tension. The Mistress of Novices always kept a steady
temper and a sympathetic sense of humor even when she was giving
you extra chores for breaking the rules.</p>

<p>But Sheriam&rsquo;s voice was grim when she spoke. &ldquo;Not a
word, Verin Sedai said, and not a word shall it be. If one of you
speaks&mdash;except to answer an Aes Sedai, of course&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
make you wish you had nothing but a switching and a few hours
scrubbing floors to worry about. Do you understand me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Egwene said, and heard the other
two say the same, although Nynaeve pronounced the words like a
challenge.</p>

<p>Sheriam made a disgusted sound in her throat, almost
a growl. &ldquo;Fewer girls now come to the Tower to be trained than once
did, but they still come. Most leave never having learned to sense
the True Source, much less touch it. A few learn enough not to harm
themselves before they go. A bare handful can aspire to be raised
to the Accepted, and fewer still to wear the shawl. It is a hard
life, a hard discipline, yet every novice fights to hold on, to
attain the ring and the shawl. Even when they are so afraid they
cry themselves to sleep every night, they struggle to hold on. And
you three, who have more ability born in you than I ever hoped to
see in my lifetime, left the Tower without permission, ran away not
even half-trained, like irresponsible children, stayed away for
months. And now you ride back in as if nothing has happened, as if
you can take up your training again on the morrow.&rdquo; She let out a
long breath as if she might explode otherwise. &ldquo;Faolain!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three Accepted jumped as if they had been caught
eavesdropping, and one, a dark, curly-haired woman, stepped
forward. They were all young women, but still older than Nynaeve.
Nynaeve&rsquo;s rapid Acceptance had been extraordinary. In the normal
course of things, it took years as a novice to earn the Great
Serpent rings they wore, and would take years more before they
could hope to be raised to full Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take them to their rooms,&rdquo; Sheriam commanded, &ldquo;and
keep them there. They may have bread, cold broth, and water until
the Amyrlin Seat says otherwise. And if one of them speaks even a
word, you may take her to the kitchens and set her to scrubbing
pots.&rdquo; She whirled and stalked away, even her back expressing
anger.</p>

<p>Faolain eyed Egwene and the others with almost a
hopeful air, especially Nynaeve, who wore a glower like a mask.
Faolain&rsquo;s round face held no love for those who broke the rules so
extravagantly, and less for one like Nynaeve, a wilder who had
earned her ring without ever being a novice, who had channeled
power before she ever entered Tar Valon. When it became obvious
that Nynaeve meant to keep her anger to herself, Faolain shrugged.
&ldquo;When the Amyrlin sends for you, you&rsquo;ll probably be stilled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give over, Faolain,&rdquo; another of the Accepted said.
The oldest of the three, she had a willowy neck and coppery skin,
and a graceful way of moving. &ldquo;I will take you,&rdquo; she told Nynaeve.
&ldquo;I am called Theodrin, and I, too, am a wilder. I will hold you to
Sheriam Sedai&rsquo;s order, but I will not bait you. Come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve gave Egwene and Elayne a worried look, then
sighed and let Theodrin lead her away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wilders,&rdquo; Faolain muttered. On her tongue, it
sounded like a curse. She turned her stare to Egwene.</p>

<p>The third Accepted, a pretty, apple-cheeked young
woman, stationed herself beside Elayne. Her mouth was turned up at
the corners as if she liked to smile, but the stern look she gave
Elayne said she would brook no nonsense now.</p>

<p>Egwene returned Faolain&rsquo;s stare with as much calm as
she could manage, and, she hoped, a measure of the haughty, silent
contempt that Elayne had adopted. <em>Red Ajah</em>, she thought.
<em>This one will definitely choose the Reds</em>. But it was hard
not to think of her own troubles. <em>Light, what are they going to
do to us?</em> She meant the Aes Sedai, the Tower, not these
women.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, come along,&rdquo; Faolain snapped. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad enough
I have to stand guard on your door without standing here all day.
Come along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taking a deep breath, Egwene gripped Elayne&rsquo;s hand
and followed. <em>Light, let them be Healing Mat</em>.</p>
