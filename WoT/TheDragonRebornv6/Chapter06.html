<h4><em>The Hunt Begins</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">P</span>errin
did not expect to sleep, but a stomach stuffed
with cold stew&mdash;his resolve about the roots had lasted until
the smells of supper&rsquo;s leftovers hit his nose&mdash;and bone
weariness pulled him down on his bed. If he dreamed, he did not
remember. He awoke to Lan shaking his shoulders, dawn through the
open door turning the Warder to a shadow haloed with light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand is gone,&rdquo; was all Lan said before he left at a
run, but it was more than enough.</p>

<p>Perrin dragged himself up yawning and dressed quickly
in the early chill. Outside, only a handful of Shienarans were in
sight, using their horses to drag Trolloc bodies into the woods,
and most of those moved as if they should be in a sickbed. A body
took time to build back the strength that being Healed took.</p>

<p>Perrin&rsquo;s stomach muttered at him, and his nose tested
the breeze in the hope that someone had already started cooking. He
was ready to eat those turnip-like roots, raw if need be. There
were only the lingering stench of slain Myrddraal, the smells of
dead Trollocs and men, alive and dead, of horses and the trees. And
dead wolves.</p>

<p>Moiraine&rsquo;s hut, high on the other side of the bowl,
seemed a center of activity. Min hurried inside, and moments later
Masema came out, then Uno. At a trot the one-eyed man vanished into
the trees, toward the sheer rock wall beyond the hut, while the
other Shienaran limped down the slope.</p>

<p>Perrin started toward the hut. As he splashed across
the shallow stream, he met Masema. The Shienaran&rsquo;s face was
haggard, the scar on his cheek prominent, and his eyes even more
sunken than usual. In the middle of the stream, he raised his head
suddenly and caught Perrin&rsquo;s coat sleeve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re from his village,&rdquo; Masema said hoarsely. &ldquo;You
must know. Why did the Lord Dragon abandon us? What sin did we
commit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sin? What are you talking about? Wherever Rand went,
it was nothing you did or didn&rsquo;t do.&rdquo; Masema did not appear
satisfied; he kept his grip on Perrin&rsquo;s sleeve, peering into his
face as if there were answers there. Icy water began to seep into
Perrin&rsquo;s left boot. &ldquo;Masema,&rdquo; he said carefully, &ldquo;whatever the Lord
Dragon did, it was according to his plan. The Lord Dragon would not
abandon us.&rdquo; <em>Or would he? If I were in his place, would
I?</em></p>

<p>Masema nodded slowly. &ldquo;Yes. Yes, I see that, now. He
has gone out alone to spread the word of his coming. We must spread
the word, too. Yes.&rdquo; He limped on across the stream, muttering to
himself.</p>

<p>Squelching at every other step, Perrin climbed to
Moiraine&rsquo;s hut and knocked. There was no answer. He hesitated a
moment, then went in.</p>

<p>The outer room, where Lan slept, was as stark and
simple as Perrin&rsquo;s own hut, with a rough bed built against one
wall, a few pegs for hanging possessions, and a single shelf. Not
much light entered through the open door, and the only other
illumination came from crude lamps on the shelf, slivers of oily
fat-wood wedged into cracks in pieces of rock. They gave off thin
streamers of smoke that made a layer of haze under the roof.
Perrin&rsquo;s nose wrinkled at the smell.</p>

<p>The low roof was only a little higher than his head.
Loial&rsquo;s head actually brushed it, even seated as he was on one end
of Lan&rsquo;s bed, with his knees drawn up to make himself small. The
Ogier&rsquo;s tufted ears twitched uneasily. Min sat cross-legged on the
dirt floor beside the door that led to Moiraine&rsquo;s room, while the
Aes Sedai paced back and forth in thought. Dark thoughts, they must
have been. Three paces each way was all she had, but she made
vigorous use of the space, the calm on her face belied by the
quickness of her step.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think Masema is going crazy,&rdquo; Perrin said.</p>

<p>Min sniffed. &ldquo;With him, how can you tell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine rounded on him, a tightness to her mouth.
Her voice was soft. Too soft. &ldquo;Is Masema the most important thing
on your mind this the morning, Perrin Aybara?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;d like to know when Rand left, and why. Did
anyone see him go? Does anyone know where he went?&rdquo; He made himself
meet her look with one just as level and firm. It was not easy. He
loomed over her, but she was Aes Sedai. &ldquo;Is this of your making
Moiraine? Did you rein him in until he was so impatient he&rsquo;d go
anywhere, do anything, just to stop sitting still?&rdquo; Loial&rsquo;s ears
went stiff, and he motioned a surreptitious warning with one
thick-fingered hand.</p>

<p>Moiraine studied Perrin with her head tilted to one
side, and it was all he could do not to drop his eyes. &ldquo;This is
none of my doing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He left sometime during the night.
When and how and why, I yet hope to learn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial&rsquo;s shoulders heaved in a quiet sigh of relief.
Quiet for an Ogier, it sounded like steam rushing out from
quenching red-hot iron. &ldquo;Never anger an Aes Sedai,&rdquo; he said in a
whisper obviously meant just for himself, but audible to everyone. &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;Better to embrace the sun than to anger an Aes Sedai.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min reached up enough to hand Perrin a folded piece
of paper. &ldquo;Loial went to see him after we got him to bed last
night, and Rand asked to borrow pen and paper and ink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Ogier&rsquo;s ears jerked, and he frowned worriedly
until his long eyebrows hung down on his cheeks. &ldquo;I did not know
what he was planning. I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know that,&rdquo; Min said. &ldquo;No one is accusing you of
anything, Loial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine frowned at the paper, but she did not try to
stop Perrin from reading. It was in Rand&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p class="note">What I do, I do because there is no other way. He is hunting
me again, and this time one of us has to die, I think. There is no
need for those around me to die, also. Too many have died for me
already. I do not want to die either, and will not, if I can manage
it. There are lies in dreams, and death, but dreams hold truth, too.</p>

<p>That was all, with no signature. There was no need
for Perrin to wonder who Rand meant by &ldquo;he.&rdquo; For Rand, for all of
them, there could be only one. Ba&rsquo;alzamon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He left that tucked under the door there,&rdquo; Min said
in a tight voice. &ldquo;He took some old clothes the Shienarans had hanging
out to dry, and his flute, and a horse. Nothing else but a little
food, as far as we can tell. None of the guards saw him go, and
last night they would have seen a mouse creeping.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And would it have done any good if they had?&rdquo;
Moiraine said calmly. &ldquo;Would any of them have stopped the <em>Lord
Dragon</em>, or even challenged him? Some of them&mdash;Masema for
one&mdash;would slit their own throats if the <em>Lord Dragon</em>
told them to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Perrin&rsquo;s turn to study her. &ldquo;Did you expect
anything else? They swore to follow him. Light, Moiraine, he&rsquo;d
never have named himself Dragon if not for you. What did you expect
of them?&rdquo; She did not speak, and he went on more quietly. &ldquo;Do you
believe, Moiraine? That he&rsquo;s really the Dragon Reborn? Or do you
just think he&rsquo;s someone you can use before the One Power kills him
or drives him mad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go easy, Perrin,&rdquo; Loial said. &ldquo;Not so angry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go easy when she answers me. Well,
Moiraine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is what he is,&rdquo; she said sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You said the Pattern would force him to the right
path eventually. Is that what this is, or is he just trying to get
away from you?&rdquo; For a moment he thought he had gone too far&mdash;her dark eyes sparkled with anger&mdash;but he refused to back
down. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine took a deep breath. &ldquo;This may well be what
the Pattern has chosen, yet I did not mean for him to go off alone.
For all his power, he is as defenseless as a babe in many ways, and
as ignorant of the world. He channels, but he has no control over
whether or not the One Power comes when he reaches for it and
almost as little over what he does with it if it does come. The
Power itself will kill him before he has a chance to go mad if he
does not learn that control. There is so much he must learn, yet.
He wants to run before he has learned to walk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You split hairs and lay false trails, Moiraine.&rdquo;
Perrin snorted. &ldquo;If he is what you say he is, did it never occur to
you that he might know what he has to do better than you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is what he is,&rdquo; she repeated firmly, &ldquo;but I must
keep him alive if he is to do anything. He will fulfill no
prophecies dead, and even if he manages to avoid Darkfriends and
Shadowspawn, there are a thousand other hands ready to slay him.
All it will take is a hint of the hundredth part of what he is. Yet
if that were all he might face, I would not worry half so much as I
do. There are the Forsaken to be accounted for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin gave a start; from the corner, Loial moaned. &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;The Dark One and all the Forsaken are bound in Shayol Ghul,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
Perrin began by rote, but she gave him no time to finish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The seals are weakening, Perrin. Some are broken,
though the world does not know that. Must not know that. The Father
of Lies is not free. Yet. But as the seals weaken, more and more,
which of the Forsaken may be loosed already? Lanfear? Sammael?
Asmodean, or Be&rsquo;lal, or Ravhin? Ishamael himself, the Betrayer of
Hope? They were thirteen altogether, Perrin, and bound in the
sealing, not in the prison that holds the Dark One. Thirteen of the
most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends, the weakest of them
stronger than the ten strongest Aes Sedai living today, the most
ignorant with all the knowledge of the Age of Legends. And every
man and woman of them gave up the Light and dedicated their souls
to the Shadow. What if they are free, and out there waiting for
him? I will not let them have him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin shivered, partly from the icy iron in her last
words, and partly from thought of the Forsaken. He did not want to
think of even one of the Forsaken loose in the world. His mother
had frightened him with those names when he was little. <em>
Ishamael comes for boys who do not tell their mothers the truth.
Lanfear waits in the night for boys who do not go to bed when they
are supposed to</em>. Being older did not help, not when he knew
now they were all real. Not when Moiraine said they might be
free.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bound in Shayol Ghul,&rdquo; he whispered, and wished he
still believed it. Troubled, he studied Rand&rsquo;s letter again.
&ldquo;Dreams. He was talking about dreams yesterday, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine stepped closer, and peered up into his face.
&ldquo;Dreams?&rdquo; Lan and Uno came in, but she waved them to silence. The
small room was more than crowded now, with five people in it
besides the Ogier. &ldquo;What dreams have <em>you</em> had the last few
days, Perrin?&rdquo; She ignored his protest that there was nothing wrong
with his dreams. &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;What dream have you had
that was not ordinary? Tell me.&rdquo; Her gaze seized him like smithy
tongs, willing him to speak.</p>

<p>He looked at the others&mdash;they were all watching
him fixedly, even Min&mdash;then hesitantly told of the one dream
that seemed unusual to him, the dream that came every night. The
dream of the sword he could not touch. He did not mention the wolf
that had appeared in the last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Callandor</em>,&rdquo; Lan breathed when he was done.
Rock-hard face or no, he looked stunned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Moiraine said, &ldquo;but we must be absolutely
certain. Speak to the others.&rdquo; As Lan hurried out, she turned to
Uno. &ldquo;And what of your dreams? Did you dream of a sword, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Shienaran shifted his feet. The red eye painted
on his patch stared straight at Moiraine, but his real eye blinked
and wavered. &ldquo;I dream about flam&mdash;uh, about swords all the
time, Moiraine Sedai,&rdquo; he said stiffly. &ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;ve dreamed
about a sword the last few nights. I don&rsquo;t remember my dreams the
way Lord Perrin here does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine said, &ldquo;Loial?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dreams are always the same, Moiraine Sedai. The
groves, and the Great Trees, and the <em>stedding</em>. We Ogier
always dream of the <em>stedding</em> when we are away from
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai turned back to Perrin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was just a dream,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Nothing but a
dream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You describe the hall called
the Heart of the Stone, in the fortress called the Stone of Tear,
as if you had stood in it. And the shining sword is <em>
Callandor</em>, the Sword That Is Not a Sword, the Sword That
Cannot Be Touched.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial sat up straight, bumping his head on the roof.
He did not seem to notice. &ldquo;The Prophecies of the Dragon say the
Stone of Tear will never fall till <em>Callandor</em> is wielded by
the Dragon&rsquo;s hand. The fall of the Stone of Tear will be one of the
greatest signs of the Dragon&rsquo;s Rebirth. If Rand holds <em>
Callandor</em>, the whole world must acknowledge him as the
Dragon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo; The word floated from the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s lips
like a shard of ice on still water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps?&rdquo; Perrin said. &ldquo;Perhaps? I thought that was
the final sign, the last thing to fulfill your Prophecies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither the first nor the last,&rdquo; Moiraine said.
&ldquo;<em>Callandor</em> will be but one fulfillment of <em>The
Karaethon Cycle</em>, as his birth on the slopes of Dragonmount was
the first. He has yet to break the nations, or shatter the world.
Even scholars who have studied the Prophecies for their entire
lives do not know how to interpret them all. What does it mean that
he &lsquo;shall slay his people with the sword of peace, and destroy them
with the leaf&rsquo;? What does it mean that he &lsquo;shall bind the nine
moons to serve him&rsquo;? Yet these are given equal weight with <em>
Callandor</em> in the <em>Cycle</em>. There are others. What
&lsquo;wounds of madness and cutting of hope&rsquo; has he healed? What chains
has he broken, and who put into chains? And some are so obscure
that he may already have fulfilled them, although I am not aware of
it. But, no, <em>Callandor</em> is far from the end of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin shrugged uneasily. He knew only bits and
pieces of the Prophecies; he had liked hearing them even less since
Rand had let Moiraine put that banner in his hands. No, it had been
before that, even. Since a journey by Portal Stone had convinced
him his life was bound to Rand&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Moiraine was continuing. &ldquo;If you think he has simply
to put out his hand, Loial son of Arent son of Halan, you are a
fool, as is he if he thinks it. Even if he lives to reach Tear, he
may never attain the Stone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tairens have no love for the One Power, and less for
any man claiming to be the Dragon. Channeling is outlawed, and Aes
Sedai are tolerated at best, so long as they do not channel.
Telling the Prophecies of the Dragon, or even possessing a copy of
them, is enough to put you in prison, in Tear. And no one enters
the Stone of Tear without permission of the High Lords; none but
the High Lords themselves enter the Heart of the Stone. He is not
ready for this. Not ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin grunted softly. The Stone would never fall
till the Dragon Reborn held <em>Callandor</em>. <em>How in the
Light is he supposed to reach it</em>&mdash;<em>inside a bloody
fortress!</em>&mdash;<em>before the fortress falls? It is
madness</em>!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are we just sitting here?&rdquo; Min burst out. &ldquo;If
Rand is going to Tear, why aren&rsquo;t we following him? He could be
killed, or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Why are we sitting here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine put a hand on Min&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;Because I must be
sure,&rdquo; she said gently. &ldquo;It is not comfortable being chosen by the
Wheel, to be great or to be near greatness. The chosen of the Wheel
can only take what comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am tired of taking what comes.&rdquo; Min scrubbed a
hand across her eyes. Perrin thought he saw tears. &ldquo;Rand could be
dying while we wait.&rdquo; Moiraine smoothed Min&rsquo;s hair; there was a
look almost of pity on the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>Perrin sat down on the end of Lan&rsquo;s bed opposite
Loial. The smell of people was thick in the room&mdash;people and
worry and fear; Loial smelled of books and trees as well as worry.
It felt like a trap, with the walls around them, and all so close.
The burning slivers stank. &ldquo;How can my dream tell where Rand is
going?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;It was my dream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those who can channel the One Power,&rdquo; Moiraine said
quietly, &ldquo;those who are particularly strong in Spirit, can
sometimes force their dreams on others.&rdquo; She did not stop her
soothing of Min. &ldquo;Especially on those who are&mdash;susceptible. I
do not believe Rand did it on purpose, but the dreams of those
touching the True Source can be powerful. For one as strong as he,
they could possibly seize an entire village, or perhaps even a
city. He knows little of what he does, and even less of how to
control it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t you have it, too?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Or
Lan.&rdquo; Uno stared straight ahead, looking as if he would rather be
anywhere else, and Loial&rsquo;s ears wilted. Perrin was too tired and
too hungry to care whether he showed proper respect for an Aes
Sedai. And too angry, as well, he realized. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine answered calmly. &ldquo;Aes Sedai learn to shield
their dreams. I do it without thinking, when I sleep. Warders are
given something much the same in the bonding. The Gaidin could not
do what they must if the Shadow could steal into their dreams. We
are all vulnerable when we sleep, and the Shadow is strong in the
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s always something new from you,&rdquo; Perrin
growled. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you tell us what to expect once in a while, instead
of explaining after it happens?&rdquo; Uno looked as though he was trying
to think of a reason to leave.</p>

<p>Moiraine gave Perrin a flat look. &ldquo;You want me to
share a lifetime of knowledge with you in a single afternoon? Or
even a single year? I will tell you this. Be wary of dreams, Perrin
Aybara. Be very wary of dreams.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pulled his eyes away from hers. &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; he
murmured. &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After that, silence, and no one seemed to want to
break it. Min sat staring at her crossed ankles, but apparently
taking some comfort from Moiraine&rsquo;s presence. Uno stood against the
wall, not looking at anyone. Loial forgot himself enough to pull a
book from his coat pocket and try to read in the dim light. The
wait was long, and far from easy for Perrin. <em>It&rsquo;s not the
Shadow in my dreams I&rsquo;m afraid of. It&rsquo;s wolves. I will not let them
in. I won&rsquo;t!</em></p>

<p>Lan returned, and Moiraine straightened eagerly. The
Warder answered the question in her eyes. &ldquo;Half of them remember
dreaming of swords the last four nights running. Some remember a
place with great columns, and five say the sword was crystal, or
glass. Masema says he saw Rand holding it last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That one would,&rdquo; Moiraine said. She rubbed her hands
together briskly; she seemed suddenly full of energy. &ldquo;Now I am
certain. Though I still wish I knew how he left here unseen. If he
has rediscovered some Talent from the Age of Legends&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan looked at Uno, and the one-eyed man shrugged in
dismay. &ldquo;I bloody forgot, with all this flaming talk about bloo&mdash;&rdquo; He cleared his throat, shooting a glance at Moiraine. She
looked back expectantly, and he went on. &ldquo;I mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that is, I followed the Lord Dragon&rsquo;s tracks. There&rsquo;s another way
into that closed valley, now. The&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the earthquake brought down
the far wall. It&rsquo;s a hard climb, but you can get a horse up it. I
found more tracks at the top, and there&rsquo;s an easy way from there
around the mountain.&rdquo; He let out a long breath when he was
done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;At least he has not
rediscovered how to fly, or make himself invisible, or something
else out of legend. We must follow him without delay. Uno, I will
give you enough gold to take you and the others as far as Jehannah,
and the name of someone there who will see that you get more. The
Ghealdanin are wary of strangers, but if you keep to yourselves,
they should not trouble you. Wait there until I send word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we will go with you,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;We have all
sworn to follow the Dragon Reborn. I do not see how the few of us
can take a fortress that has never fallen, but with the Lord
Dragon&rsquo;s aid, we will do what must be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So we are &lsquo;the People of the Dragon,&rsquo; now.&rdquo; Perrin
laughed mirthlessly. &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;The Stone of Tear will never fall till the
People of the Dragon come.&rsquo; Have you given us a new name,
Moiraine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch your tongue, blacksmith,&rdquo; Lan growled, all ice
and stone.</p>

<p>Moiraine gave them both sharp looks, and they fell
silent. &ldquo;Forgive me, Uno,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but we must travel quickly if
we are to have a hope of overtaking him. You are the only Shienaran
fit enough for a hard ride, and we cannot afford the days the
others will need to regain full strength. I will send for you when
I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uno grimaced, but he bowed in acquiescence. At her
dismissal, he squared his shoulders and left to tell the
others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am going along, whatever you say,&rdquo; Min put
in firmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are going to Tar Valon,&rdquo; Moiraine told her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am no such thing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai went on smoothly as if the other woman
had not spoken. &ldquo;The Amyrlin Seat must be told what has happened,
and I cannot count on finding one I can trust who has messenger
pigeons. Or that the Amyrlin will see any message I send by pigeon.
It is a long journey, and hard. I would not send you alone if there
were anyone to send with you, but I will see you have money, and
letters to those who might help you on your way. You must ride
quickly, though. When your horse tires, buy another&mdash;or steal
one, if you must&mdash;but ride quickly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let Uno take your message. He&rsquo;s fit; you said so. I
am going after Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uno has his duties, Min. And do you think a man
could simply walk up to the gates of the White Tower and demand an
audience with the Amyrlin Seat? Even a king would be made to wait
days if he arrived unannounced, and I fear any of the Shienarans
would be left kicking their heels for weeks, if not forever. Not to
mention that something so unusual would be known to everyone in Tar
Valon before the first sunset. Few women seek audiences with the
Amyrlin herself, but it does happen, and it should occasion no
great comment. No one must learn even as much as that the Amyrlin
Seat has received a message from me. Her life&mdash;and ours&mdash;could depend on it. You are the one who must go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min sat there opening and closing her mouth,
obviously searching for another argument, but Moiraine had already
gone on. &ldquo;Lan, I very much fear we will find more evidence of his
passing than I would like, but I will rely on your tracking.&rdquo; The
Warder nodded. &ldquo;Perrin? Loial? Will you come with me after Rand?&rdquo;
From her place against the wall, Min gave an indignant squawk, but
the Aes Sedai ignored it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will come,&rdquo; Loial said quickly. &ldquo;Rand is my
friend. And I will admit it; I would not miss anything. For my
book, you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin was slower to answer. Rand was his friend,
whatever he had become in the forging. And there was that near
certainty of their futures being linked, though he would have
avoided that part of it if he could. &ldquo;It has to be done, doesn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; he said finally. &ldquo;I will come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; Moiraine rubbed her hands together again,
with the air of someone settling to work. &ldquo;You must all ready
yourselves at once. Rand has hours on us. I mean to be well along
his trail before midday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slender as she was, the force of her presence herded
all of them but Lan toward the door, Loial walking stooped over
until he was through the doorway. Perrin thought of a goodwife
herding geese.</p>

<p>Once outside, Min hung back for a moment to address
Lan with a too-sweet smile. &ldquo;And is there any message you want
carried? To Nynaeve, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Warder blinked as if caught off guard, like a
horse on three legs. &ldquo;Does everyone know&mdash;?&rdquo; He regained his
balance almost immediately. &ldquo;If there is anything else she needs to
hear from me, I will tell her myself.&rdquo; He closed the door nearly in
her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men!&rdquo; Min muttered at the door. &ldquo;Too blind to see
what a stone could see, and too stubborn to be trusted to think for
themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin inhaled deeply. Faint smells of death still
hung in the valley air, but it was better than the closeness
inside. Some better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clean air,&rdquo; Loial sighed. &ldquo;The smoke was beginning
to bother me a little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They started down the slope together. Beside the
stream below, the Shienarans who could stand were gathered around
Uno. From his gestures the one-eyed man was making up for lost time
with his cursing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you two become privileged?&rdquo; Min demanded
abruptly. &ldquo;She <em>asked</em> you. She didn&rsquo;t do me the courtesy of
asking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial shook his head. &ldquo;I think she asked because she
knew what we would answer, Min. Moiraine seems able to read Perrin
and me; she knows what we&rsquo;ll do. But you are a closed book to
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min appeared only a little mollified. She looked up
at them, Perrin head and shoulders taller on one side and Loial
towering even higher on the other. &ldquo;Much good it does me. I am
still going where she wants as easily as you two little lambs. You
were doing well for a while, Perrin. Standing up to her like she&rsquo;d
sold you a coat and the seams were popping open.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did stand up to her, didn&rsquo;t I,&rdquo; Perrin said
wonderingly. He had not really realized he had done that. &ldquo;It was
not so bad as I&rsquo;d have thought it would be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were lucky,&rdquo; Loial rumbled. &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;To anger an Aes
Sedai is to put your head in a hornet&rsquo;s nest.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Loial,&rdquo; Min said, &ldquo;I need to speak to Perrin. Alone.
Would you mind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh. Of course not.&rdquo; He lengthened his stride to its
normal span and quickly moved ahead of them, pulling his pipe and
tabac pouch from a coat pocket.</p>

<p>Perrin eyed her warily. She was biting her lip, as if
considering what to say. &ldquo;Do you ever see things about him?&rdquo; he
asked, nodding after the Ogier.</p>

<p>She shook her head. &ldquo;I think it only works with
humans. But I&rsquo;ve seen things around you that you ought to know
about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be more thickheaded than you have to be,
Perrin. Back there, right after you said you&rsquo;d go. They were not
there before. They must have to do with this journey. Or at least
with you deciding to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a moment he said reluctantly, &ldquo;What did you
see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An Aielman in a cage,&rdquo; she said promptly. &ldquo;A
Tuatha&rsquo;an with a sword. A falcon and a hawk, perching on your
shoulders. Both female, I think. And all the rest, of course. What
is always there. Darkness swirling &rsquo;round you, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of that!&rdquo; he said quickly. When he was sure she
had stopped, he scratched his head, thinking. None of it made any
sense to him. &ldquo;Do you have any idea what it all means? The new
things, I mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but they&rsquo;re important. The things I see always
are. Turning points in people&rsquo;s lives, or what&rsquo;s fated. It&rsquo;s always
important.&rdquo; She hesitated for a moment, glancing at him. &ldquo;One more
thing,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;If you meet a woman&mdash;the most
beautiful woman you&rsquo;ve ever seen&mdash;run!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin blinked. &ldquo;You saw a beautiful woman? Why
should I run from a beautiful woman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you just take advice?&rdquo; she said irritably. She
kicked at a stone and watched it roll down the slope.</p>

<p>Perrin did not like jumping to conclusions&mdash;it
was one of the reasons some people thought him slow-witted&mdash;but he totaled up a number of things Min had said in the last few
days and came to a startling conclusion. He stopped dead, hunting
for words. &ldquo;Uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Min, you know I like you. I like you, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;you sort of remind me of my sisters. I mean, you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; The flow stumbled to a halt as she raised her head to look
at him, eyebrows arched. She wore a small smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Perrin, you must know that I love you.&rdquo; She
stood there, watching his mouth work, then spoke slowly and
carefully. &ldquo;Like a brother, you great wooden-headed lummox! The
arrogance of men never ceases to amaze me. You all think everything
has to do with you, and every woman has to desire you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin felt his face growing hot. &ldquo;I never&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I
didn&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He cleared his throat. &ldquo;What did you see about a
woman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just take my advice,&rdquo; she said, and started down
toward the stream again, walking fast. &ldquo;If you forget all the
rest,&rdquo; she called over her shoulder, &ldquo;heed that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He frowned after her&mdash;for once his thoughts
seemed to arrange themselves quickly&mdash;then caught up in two
strides. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Rand, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She made a sound in her throat and gave him a
sidelong look. She did not slow down, though. &ldquo;Maybe you aren&rsquo;t so
boneheaded after all,&rdquo; she muttered. After a moment she added, as
if to herself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bound to him as surely as a stave is bound to
the barrel. But I can&rsquo;t see if he&rsquo;ll ever love me in return. And I
am not the only one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does Egwene know?&rdquo; he asked. Rand and Egwene had
been all but promised since childhood. Everything but kneeling in
front of the Women&rsquo;s Circle of the village to speak the betrothal.
He was not sure how far they had drifted from that, if at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She knows,&rdquo; Min said curtly. &ldquo;Much good it does
either of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about Rand? Does he know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; she said bitterly. &ldquo;I told him,
didn&rsquo;t I? &lsquo;Rand, I did a viewing of you, and it seems I have to
fall in love with you. I have to share you, too, and I don&rsquo;t much
like that, but there it is.&rsquo; You&rsquo;re a wooden-headed wonder after
all, Perrin Aybara.&rdquo; She dashed a hand across her eyes angrily. &ldquo;If
I could be with him, I know I could help. Somehow. Light, if he
dies, I don&rsquo;t know if I can stand it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin shrugged uncomfortably. &ldquo;Listen, Min. I&rsquo;ll do
what I can to help him.&rdquo; <em>However much that is</em>. &ldquo;I promise
you that. It really is best for you to go to Tar Valon. You&rsquo;ll be
safe there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Safe?&rdquo; She tasted the word as if wondering what it
meant. &ldquo;You think Tar Valon is safe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s no safety in Tar Valon, there&rsquo;s no safety
anywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sniffed loudly, and in silence they went to join
those preparing to leave.</p>
