<h4><em>In Search of a Remedy</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">S</span>lumped
on the stool in the gleeman&rsquo;s room, Mat
grimaced as Thom coughed again. <em>How are we going to keep
looking if he&rsquo;s so bloody sick he can&rsquo;t walk?</em> He was ashamed
as soon as he thought it. Thom had been as assiduous in searching
as he had, pushing himself day and night, when he had to know he
was coming down sick. Mat had been so absorbed in his hunt that he
had paid too little attention to Thom&rsquo;s coughing. The change from
constant rain to steamy heat had not helped it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, Thom,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Lopar says there&rsquo;s a Wise
Woman not far. That is what they call a Wisdom here&mdash;a Wise
Woman. Wouldn&rsquo;t Nynaeve like that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not need&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;any foul-tasting&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;concoctions&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;poured down my throat, boy.&rdquo; Thom stuffed a fist
through his mustaches in a vain attempt to stop his hacking. &ldquo;You
go ahead looking. Just give me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a few hours&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;on my bed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and I&rsquo;ll join you.&rdquo; The wracking wheezes doubled him over till
his head was almost on his knees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I am supposed to do all the work while you take
your ease?&rdquo; Mat said lightly. &ldquo;How can I find anything without you?
You learn most of what we hear.&rdquo; That was not exactly true; men
talked as freely over dice as they did while buying a gleeman a cup
of wine. More freely than they did with a gleeman hacking so hard
they feared contagion. But he was beginning to think that Thom&rsquo;s
cough was not going to go away by itself. <em>If the old goat dies
on me, who will I play stones with?</em> he told himself roughly.
&ldquo;Anyway, your bloody coughing keeps me awake even in the next
room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ignoring the white-haired man&rsquo;s protests, he pulled
Thom to his feet. He was shocked at how much of the gleeman&rsquo;s
weight he had to support. Despite the damp heat, Thom insisted on
his patch-covered cloak. Mat had his own coat unbuttoned completely
and all three ties of his shirt undone, but he let the old goat
have his way. No one in the common room even looked up as he half
carried Thom out into the muggy afternoon.</p>

<p>The innkeeper had given simple directions, but when
they reached the gate, and faced the mud of the Maule, Mat almost
turned back to ask after another Wise Woman. There had to be more
than one in a city this size. Thom&rsquo;s wheezing decided him. With a
grimace Mat stepped off into the mud, half carrying the
gleeman.</p>

<p>He had thought from the directions that they must
have passed the Wise Woman&rsquo;s house on their way up from the dock
that first night, and when he saw the long, narrow house with
bunches of herbs hanging in the windows, right next to a potter&rsquo;s
shop, he remembered it. Lopar had said something about going to the
back door, but he had had enough of mud.</p>

<p><em>And the stink of fish</em>, he thought, frowning
at the barefoot men squelching by with their baskets on their
backs. There were tracks of horses in the street, too, just
beginning to be obliterated by feet and ox-carts. Horses pulling a
wagon, or maybe a carriage. He had seen nothing but oxen drawing
carts or wagons either one in Tear&mdash;the nobles and the merchants
were proud of their fine stock, and never let one be put to
anything like work&mdash;but he had not seen any carriages since leaving
the walled city, either.</p>

<p>Dismissing horses and wheel tracks from his mind, he
took Thom to the front door and knocked. After a time he knocked
again. Then again.</p>

<p>He was on the point of giving up and returning to The
White Crescent despite Thom coughing on his shoulder when he heard
shuffling footsteps inside.</p>

<p>The door opened barely more than a crack, and a
stout, gray-haired woman peered out. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; she asked
in a tired voice.</p>

<p>Mat put on his best grin. <em>Light, but I am getting
sick myself at all these people who sound like there&rsquo;s no bloody
hope</em>. &ldquo;Mother Guenna? My name is Mat Cauthon. Cavan Lopar told
me you might do something for my friend&rsquo;s cough. I can pay
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She studied them a moment, seemed to listen to Thom&rsquo;s
wheezes, then sighed. &ldquo;I suppose I can still do that, at least. You
might as well come in.&rdquo; She swung the door open and was already
plodding toward the back of the house before Mat moved.</p>

<p>Her accent sounded so much like the Amyrlin&rsquo;s that he
shivered, but he followed, all but carrying Thom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;need this,&rdquo; the gleeman wheezed.
&ldquo;Bloody mixtures&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;always taste like&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;dung!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut up, Thom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leading them all the way to the kitchen, the stout
woman rummaged in one of the cupboards, taking out small stone pots
and packets of herbs while muttering to herself.</p>

<p>Mat sat Thom down in one of the high-backed chairs,
and glanced through the nearest window. There were three good
horses tied out back; he was surprised the Wise Woman had more than
one, or any for that matter. He had not seen anyone in Tear riding
except nobles and the wealthy, and these animals looked as if they
had cost more than a little silver. <em>Horses again. I don&rsquo;t care
about bloody horses now!</em></p>

<p>Mother Guenna brewed some sort of strong tea with a
rank smell and forced it down Thom&rsquo;s throat, holding his nose when
he tried to complain. Mat decided she had less fat on her than he
had thought, from the way she held the gleeman&rsquo;s head steady in the
crook of one arm while she poured the black liquid into him no
matter how hard he tried to stop her.</p>

<p>When she took the cup away, Thom coughed and scrubbed
at his mouth with equal vigor. &ldquo;Gaaah! Woman&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;whether you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;mean to drown me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;or kill me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;with
the taste! You ought&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to be a bloody&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;blacksmith!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will take the same twice a day till that hacking
is gone,&rdquo; she said firmly. &ldquo;And I have a salve that you&rsquo;ll rub on
your chest every night.&rdquo; Some of the weariness left her voice as
she confronted the gleeman, fists on her broad hips. &ldquo;That salve
stinks as bad as this tea tastes, but you will rub it on&mdash;thoroughly!&mdash;or I&rsquo;ll drag you upstairs like a
scrawny carp in a net and tie you to a bed with that cloak of
yours! I never had a gleeman come to me before, and I&rsquo;ll not let
the first one that does cough himself to death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom glowered and blew out his mustaches with a
cough, but he seemed to take her threat seriously. At least, he did
not say anything, but he looked as if he meant to throw her tea and
her salve right back at her.</p>

<p>The more this Mother Guenna talked, the more she
sounded like the Amyrlin to Mat. From the sour look on Thom&rsquo;s face,
and the steady stare on hers, he decided he had better smooth
matters over a little before the gleeman refused to take her
medicines. And she decided to make him. &ldquo;I knew a woman once who
talked like you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;All fish and nets and things. Sounded
like you, too. The same accent, I mean. I suppose she&rsquo;s
Tairen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo; The gray-haired woman suddenly sounded
tired again, and she kept staring at the floor. &ldquo;I knew some girls
with the sound of your speech on their tongues, too. Two of them
had it, anyway.&rdquo; She sighed heavily.</p>

<p>Mat felt his scalp prickle. <em>My luck can&rsquo;t be this
good</em>. But he would not bet a copper on two other women with
Two Rivers accents just happening to be in Tear. &ldquo;Three girls?
Young women? Named Egwene, and Nynaeve, and Elayne? That one has
hair like the sun, and blue eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She frowned at him. &ldquo;Those were not the names they
gave,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;yet I suspected they did not give me their
true names. But they had their reasons, I thought. One of them was
a pretty girl with bright blue eyes and red-gold hair to her
shoulders.&rdquo; She described Nynaeve with her braid to her waist and
Egwene with her big, dark eyes and ready smile, too. Three pretty
women as different from one another as they could be. &ldquo;I see they
are the ones you know,&rdquo; she finished. &ldquo;I am sorry, boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you sorry? I have been trying to find them
for days!&rdquo; <em>Light, I walked right past this place the first
night! Right past them! I wanted random. What could be more random
than where a ship docks on a rainy night, and where you happen to
look in a bloody lightning flash? Burn me! Burn me!</em> &ldquo;Tell me
where they are, Mother Guenna.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gray-haired woman stared wearily at the stove
where her spouted kettle was steaming. Her mouth worked, but she
said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; Mat demanded. &ldquo;It is important!
They are in danger if I don&rsquo;t find them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not understand,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;You are an
outlander. The High Lords&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not care about any&mdash;&rdquo; Mat blinked, and
looked at Thom. The gleeman seemed to be frowning, but he was
coughing so hard, Mat could not be sure. &ldquo;What do the High Lords
have to do with my friends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You just do not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me I do not understand! I will pay for
the information!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mother Guenna glared at him. &ldquo;I do not take money for&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&rdquo; She grimaced fiercely. &ldquo;You ask me to tell you things I
have been told not to speak of. Do you know what will happen to me
if I do and you breathe my name? I will lose my tongue, to begin.
Then I will lose other parts before the High Lords have what is
left of me hung up to scream its last hours as a reminder to others
to obey. And it will do those young women no good, not my telling
or my dying!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promise I will never mention your name to anyone.
I swear it.&rdquo; <em>And I&rsquo;ll keep that oath, old woman, if you only
tell me where they bloody are!</em> &ldquo;Please? They are in
danger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She studied him for a long time; before she was done
he had the feeling she knew every detail of him. &ldquo;On that oath, I
will tell you. I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;liked them. But you can do nothing. You are
too late, Matrim Cauthon. Too late by nearly three hours. They have
been taken to the Stone. The High Lord Samon sent for them.&rdquo; She
shook her head in worried puzzlement. &ldquo;He sent&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;women who&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;could channel. I hold nothing against Aes Sedai myself, but that
is against the law. The law the High Lords made. If they break
every other law, they would not break that one. Why would a High
Lord send Aes Sedai on his errands? Why would he want those girls
at all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat almost burst out laughing. &ldquo;Aes Sedai? Mother
Guenna, you had my heart in my throat, and maybe my liver, too. If
Aes Sedai came for them, there is nothing to worry about. All three
of them are going to be Aes Sedai themselves. Not that I like it
much, but that&rsquo;s what they&mdash;&rdquo; His grin faded at the heavy way
she shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boy, those girls fought like lionfish in a net.
Whether they mean to be Aes Sedai or not, those who took them
treated them like bilge pumpings. Friends do not give bruises like
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He felt his face twisting. <em>Aes Sedai hurt them?
What in the Light? The bloody Stone. It makes the Palace in Caemlyn
look like walking into a barnyard! Burn me! I stood right out there
in the rain and stared at this house! Burn me for a bloody
Light-blinded fool!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;If you break your hand,&rdquo; Mother Guenna said, &ldquo;I will
splint and poultice it, but if you damage my wall, I will strip
your hide like a redfish!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He blinked, then looked at his fist, at scraped
knuckles. He did not even remember punching the wall.</p>

<p>The broad woman took his hand in a strong grip, but
the fingers she used to probe were surprisingly gentle. &ldquo;Nothing
broken,&rdquo; she grunted after a while. Her eyes were just as gentle as
she studied his face. &ldquo;It seems you care for them. One of them, at
least, I suppose it is. I am sorry, Mat Cauthon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;At least I know where they
are, now. All I have to do is get them out.&rdquo; He fished out his last
two Andoran gold crowns and pressed them into her hand. &ldquo;For Thom&rsquo;s
medicines, and for letting me know about the girls.&rdquo; On impulse, he
gave her a quick kiss on the cheek and a grin. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s for
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Startled, she touched her cheek, not seeming to know
whether to look at the coins or at him. &ldquo;Get them out, you say.
Just like that. Out of the Stone.&rdquo; Abruptly she stabbed him in the
ribs with a finger as hard as a tree stub. &ldquo;You remind me of my
husband, Mat Cauthon. He was a headstrong fool who would sail into
the teeth of a gale and laugh, too. I could almost think you&rsquo;ll
manage it.&rdquo; Suddenly she saw his muddy boots, apparently for the
first time. &ldquo;It took me six months to teach him not to track mud
into my house. If you do get those girls out, whichever of them you
have your eye on will have a hard time training you to make you fit
to be let inside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are the only woman who could do that,&rdquo; he said
with a grin that broadened at her glare. <em>Get them out. That&rsquo;s
all I have to do. Bring them right out of the Stone of bloody
Tear</em>. Thom coughed again. <em>He isn&rsquo;t going into the Stone
like that. Only, how do I stop him?</em> &ldquo;Mother Guenna, can I
leave my friend here? I think he is too sick to go back to the
inn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Thom barked. He tried to push himself out of
the chair, coughing so he could hardly speak. &ldquo;I am no&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;such
thing, boy! You think&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;walking into the Stone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;will be
like&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;walking into your mother&rsquo;s kitchen? You think you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;would make it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;as far as the gates&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;without me?&rdquo; He hung
on the back of the chair, his wheezing and hacking keeping him from
rising more than halfway to his feet.</p>

<p>Mother Guenna put a hand on his shoulder and pushed
him back down as easily as a child. The gleeman gave her a startled
look. &ldquo;I will take care of him, Mat Cauthon,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Thom shouted. &ldquo;You cannot&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;do this to me!
You can&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;leave me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;with this old&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Only her hand
on his shoulder kept him from doubling over.</p>

<p>Mat grinned at the white-haired man. &ldquo;I have enjoyed
knowing you, Thom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he hurried out into the street, he found himself
wondering why he had said that. <em>He isn&rsquo;t going to bloody die.
That woman will keep him alive if she has to drag him kicking and
screaming out of his grave by his mustaches. Yes, but who is going
to keep me alive?</em></p>

<p>Ahead of him, the Stone of Tear loomed over the city,
impregnable, a fortress besieged a hundred times, a stone on which
a hundred armies had broken their teeth. And he had to get inside,
somehow. And bring out three women. Somehow.</p>

<p>With a laugh that made even the sullen folk in the
street look at him, he headed back for The White Crescent, uncaring
of mud or the damp heat. He could feel the dice tumbling inside his
head.</p>
