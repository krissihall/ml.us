<h4><em>A Trap To Spring</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n a corner the spit dog was lying at its ease.
Glaring at it, Nynaeve mopped sweat from her forehead with her hand
and leaned her back into doing the work he should have done. <em>
I&rsquo;d not have put it past them to shove me in his wicker wheel
instead of letting me turn this Light-forsaken handle! Aes Sedai!
Burn them all</em>! It was a measure of her upset that she used
such language, and another that she did not even notice she had
done it. She did not think the fire in the long, gray stone
fireplace would seem any hotter if she crawled into it. She was
sure the brindle dog was grinning at her.</p>

<p>Elayne was skimming grease out of the dripping pan
under the roasts with a long-handled wooden spoon, while Egwene
used its twin to baste the meat. The great kitchen went on about
its midday routine around them. Even the novices had grown so used
to seeing Accepted there that they hardly even glanced at the three
women. Not that the cooks allowed the novices to dawdle for
gawking. Work built character, so the Aes Sedai said, and the cooks
saw to it that the novices built strong character. And the three
Accepted, too.</p>

<p>Laras, the Mistress of the Kitchens&mdash;she was
really the chief cook, but so many had used the other for so long
that it might as well have been her title&mdash;came over to
examine the roasts. And the women sweating over them. She was more
than merely stout, with layers of chins, and a spotless white apron
that could have made three novice dresses. She carried her own
long-handled wooden spoon like a scepter. It was not for stirring,
that spoon. It was for directing those under her, and smacking
those who were not building character quickly enough to suit her.
She studied the roasts, sniffed disparagingly, and turned her frown
on the three Accepted.</p>

<p>Nynaeve met Laras&rsquo; look with a level look of her own
and kept turning the spit. The massive woman&rsquo;s face never altered.
Nynaeve had tried smiling, but that did nothing to change Laras&rsquo;
expression. Stopping work to speak to her, quite civilly, had been
a disaster. It was bad enough being bullied and chivied by Aes
Sedai. She had to put up with that, however much it rankled and
burned, if she was to learn how to use her abilities. Not that she
liked what she could do&mdash;it was one thing to know Aes Sedai
were not Darkfriends for channeling the Power, but quite another to
know she herself could channel&mdash;yet she had to learn if she
was to get back at Moiraine; hating Moiraine for what she had done
to Egwene and the other Emond&rsquo;s Fielders, pulling their lives apart
and manipulating them all for Aes Sedai purposes, was nearly all
that kept her going. But to be treated as a lazy, none-too-bright
child by this Laras, to be forced to curtsy and scurry for this
women she could have put in her place with a few well-chosen words
back home&mdash;that made her grind her teeth almost as much as
did the thought of Moiraine. <em>Maybe if I just do not look at
her</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>No! I will be burned if I&rsquo;ll drop my eyes before
this</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>this cow!</em></p>

<p>Laras sniffed more loudly and walked away. She rolled
from side to side as she crossed the freshly mopped gray tiles.</p>

<p>Still bending with spoon and greasepot, Elayne
glowered after her. &ldquo;If that woman strikes me but once more, I
shall have Gareth Bryne arrest her and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet,&rdquo; Egwene whispered. She did not stop
basting the roasts, and she never looked at Elayne. &ldquo;She has ears
like a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laras turned back as if she had indeed heard, her
frown deepening, and her mouth opened wide. Before a sound emerged,
the Amyrlin Seat entered the kitchen like a whirlwind. Even the
striped stole on her shoulders seemed to bristle. For once, Leane
was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p><em>At last</em>, Nynaeve thought grimly. <em>And not
beforetime, either!</em></p>

<p>But the Amyrlin did not glance her way. The Amyrlin
did not say a word to anyone. Running her hand across a tabletop
scrubbed bone-white, she looked at her fingers and grimaced as if
at filth. Laras was at her side in an instant, all smiles, but the
Amyrlin&rsquo;s flat stare made her swallow them in silence.</p>

<p>The Amyrlin stalked about the kitchen. She stared at
the women slicing oatcake. She glared at the women peeling
vegetables. She sneered into the soup kettles, then at the women
tending them; the women became engrossed in studying the surface of
the soup. Her frown set the girls carrying plates and bowls out to
the dining hall to a run. Her glower put the novices darting like
mice sighting a cat. By the time she had made her way half around
the kitchen, every woman there was working twice as fast as she had
been. By the time she completed her circuit, Laras was the only one
even daring to glance at her.</p>

<p>The Amyrlin stopped in front of the roasting spit,
fists on her hips, and looked at Laras. She only looked,
expressionless, blue eyes cold and hard.</p>

<p>The large woman gulped, and her chins wobbled as she
smoothed her apron. The Amyrlin did not blink. Laras&rsquo; eyes dropped,
and she shifted heavily from foot to foot. &ldquo;If the Mother will
pardon me,&rdquo; she said in a faint voice. Making something that might
have been meant for a curtsy, she rushed away, so forgetting
herself that she joined the women at one of the soup kettles and
began stirring with her own spoon.</p>

<p>Nynaeve smiled, keeping her head down to hide it.
Egwene and Elayne kept working, too, but they also kept glancing at
the Amyrlin, standing with her back to them not two paces away.</p>

<p>The Amyrlin was spreading her stare across the entire
kitchen from where she stood. &ldquo;If they are this easily cowed,&rdquo; she
muttered softly, &ldquo;perhaps they really have been getting away with
too much for too long.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Easily cowed indeed</em>, Nynaeve thought. <em>
Pitiful excuses for women. All she did was look at them!</em> The
Amyrlin glanced over a stole-covered shoulder, caught her eye for
an instant. Suddenly Nynaeve realized she was turning the spit
faster. She told herself she had to pretend to be cowed like
everyone else.</p>

<p>The Amyrlin&rsquo;s gaze fell on Elayne, and abruptly she
spoke, nearly loud enough to rattle the copper pots and pans
hanging on the walls. &ldquo;There are some words I will not tolerate in
a young woman&rsquo;s mouth, Elayne of House Trakand. If you let them in,
I will see them scrubbed out!&rdquo; Everyone in the kitchen jumped.</p>

<p>Elayne looked confused, and indignation crept across
Egwene&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>Nynaeve shook her head, small frantic shakes. <em>No,
girl! Hold your tongue! Don&rsquo;t you see what she is doing?</em></p>

<p>But Egwene did open her mouth, with a respectful if
determined, &ldquo;Mother, she did not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; The Amyrlin&rsquo;s roar produced another ripple
of jumps. &ldquo;Laras! Can you find something to teach two girls to
speak when they should and say what they should, <em>Mistress</em>
of the Kitchens? Can you manage that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laras came waddling faster than Nynaeve had ever seen
the woman move before, darting at Elayne and Egwene to seize an ear
of each, all the while repeating, &ldquo;Yes, Mother. Immediately,
Mother. As you command, Mother.&rdquo; She hurried the two young women
out of the kitchen as if eager to escape the Amyrlin&rsquo;s stare.</p>

<p>The Amyrlin was now close enough to Nynaeve to touch
her, but still looking over the kitchen. A young cook, turning with
a mixing bowl in her hands, chanced to catch the Amyrlin&rsquo;s eye. She
gave a great squeak as she scuttled away across the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not mean for Egwene to be caught in that.&rdquo; The
Amyrlin barely moved her lips. It looked as if she were muttering
to herself, and from the expression on her face, no one in the
kitchen wanted to hear what she was saying. Nynaeve could just make
out the words. &ldquo;But perhaps it will teach her to think before she
speaks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve turned the spit and kept her head down,
trying to look as if she were also muttering under her breath if
anyone looked. &ldquo;I thought you were going to keep a close eye on us.
Mother. So we could report what we find.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I came to stare at you every day, Daughter, some
would grow suspicious.&rdquo; The Amyrlin kept up her study of the
kitchen. Most of the women seemed to be avoiding even looking in
her direction for fear of incurring her wrath. &ldquo;I planned to have
you brought to my study after the midday meal. To scold you for not
choosing your studies, so I implied to Leane. But there is news
that could not wait. Sheriam found another Gray Man. A woman. Dead
as last week&rsquo;s fish, and not a mark on her. She was laid out as if
resting, right in the middle of Sheriam&rsquo;s bed. Not very pleasant
for Sheriam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve stiffened, and the spit halted for a moment
before she put it back to revolving. &ldquo;Sheriam had a chance to see
the lists Verin gave to Egwene. So did Elaida. I make no
accusations, but they had the chance. And Egwene said Alanna&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;behaved oddly, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She told you of that, did she? Alanna is Arafellin.
They have strange ideas about honor and debts in Arafel.&rdquo; She
shrugged dismissively, but said, &ldquo;I suppose I can keep an eye on
her. Have you learned anything useful yet, child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some,&rdquo; Nynaeve muttered grimly. <em>What about
keeping an eye on Sheriam? Maybe she didn&rsquo;t just find that Gray
Man. The Amyrlin could watch Elaida, too, for that matter. So
Alanna really did</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;I do not understand why you trust
Else Grinwell, but your message was helpful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In short, quick sentences, Nynaeve told of the things
they had found in the storeroom under the library, making it seem
only she and Egwene had gone, and added the conclusions they had
reached concerning them. She did not mention Egwene&rsquo;s dream&mdash;or whatever it had been; Egwene insisted it had been real&mdash;of
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. Nor did she speak of the <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em> Verin had given Egwene. She could not make herself
entirely trust the woman wearing the seven-striped stole&mdash;or
any woman who could wear the shawl, for that matter&mdash;and it
seemed best to keep some things in reserve.</p>

<p>When she was done, the Amyrlin was silent so long
that Nynaeve began to think the woman had not heard. She was about
to repeat herself, a little louder, when the Amyrlin finally spoke,
still hardly moving her lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sent no message, Daughter. The things Liandrin and
the others left were searched thoroughly, and burned after nothing
was found. No one would use Black Ajah leavings. As for Else
Grinwell&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I remember the girl. She could have learned, had she
applied herself, but all she wanted was to smile at the men at the
Warders&rsquo; practice yard. Else Grinwell was put on a trading vessel
and sent back to her mother ten days ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve tried to swallow the lump that had formed in
her throat. The Amyrlin&rsquo;s words made her think of bullies taunting
smaller children. The bullies were always so contemptuous of the
littler children, always so sure the small ones were too stupid to
realize what was happening, that they made little effort to
disguise their snares. That the Black Ajah was so contemptuous of
her made her blood boil. That they could set this snare filled her
stomach with ice. <em>Light, if Else was sent away</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>
Light, anybody I talk to could be Liandrin, or any of the others.
Light!</em></p>

<p>The spit had stopped. Hastily she started it turning
once more. No one seemed to have noticed, though. They were all
still doing their best not to look at the Amyrlin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what do you mean to do about this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;so-obvious trap?&rdquo; the Amyrlin said softly, still staring over the
kitchen, away from Nynaeve. &ldquo;Do you mean to fall into this one,
too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s face reddened. &ldquo;I know this trap for a
trap. Mother. And the best way to catch whoever set a trap is to
spring it and wait for him&mdash;or her&mdash;to come.&rdquo; It
sounded weaker than it had when she had said it to Egwene and
Elayne, after what the Amyrlin had just told her, but she still
meant it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so, child. Perhaps it is the way to find
them. If they do not come and find you held tightly in their net.&rdquo;
She gave a vexed sigh. &ldquo;I will put gold in your room for the
journey. And I will let it be whispered about that I have sent you
out to a farm to hoe cabbages. Will Elayne be going with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve forgot herself enough to stare at the
Amyrlin, then hurriedly put her eyes back on her hands. Her
knuckles were white on the spit handle. &ldquo;You scheming old&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Why
all the pretense, if you knew? Your sly plots have had us squirming
nearly as much as the Black Ajah has. Why?&rdquo; The Amyrlin&rsquo;s face had
tightened, enough to make her force a more respectful tone. &ldquo;If I
may ask, Mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin snorted. &ldquo;Putting Morgase back on the
proper path whether she wants to go or not will be hard enough
without her thinking I&rsquo;ve sent her daughter to sea in a leaky
skiff. This way I can say straight out that it was none of my
doing. It may be a bit hard on Elayne, when she finally has to face
her mother, but I have three hounds, now, not two. I told you I&rsquo;d
have a hundred if I could.&rdquo; She adjusted her stole on her
shoulders. &ldquo;This has gone on long enough. If I stay this close to
you, it may be noticed. Have you anything more to tell me? Or to
ask? Make it quick, Daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is <em>Callandor</em>, Mother?&rdquo; Nynaeve
asked.</p>

<p>This time it was the Amyrlin who forgot herself, half
turning toward Nynaeve before jerking herself back. &ldquo;They cannot be
allowed to have that.&rdquo; Her whisper was barely audible, as if meant
for her own ears alone. &ldquo;They cannot possibly take it, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;
She took a deep breath, and her soft words firmed enough to be
clear to Nynaeve, if to no one two paces further away. &ldquo;No more
than a dozen women in the Tower know what <em>Callandor</em> is,
and perhaps as many outside. The High Lords of Tear know, but they
never speak of it except when a Lord of the Land is told on being
raised. The Sword That Cannot Be Touched is a <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>,
girl. Only two more powerful were ever made, and thank the Light,
neither of those was ever used. With <em>Callandor</em> in your
hands, child, you could level a city at one blow. If you die
keeping that out of the Black Ajah&rsquo;s hands&mdash;you, and Egwene,
and Elayne, all three&mdash;you&rsquo;ll have done a service to the
whole world, and cheap at the price.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could they take it?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked. &ldquo;I thought
only the Dragon Reborn could touch <em>Callandor</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin gave her a sideways look sharp enough to
carve the roasts on the spit. &ldquo;They could be after something else,&rdquo;
she said after a moment. &ldquo;They stole <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> here. The
Stone of Tear holds nearly as many <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> as the
Tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought the High Lords hated anything to do with
the One Power,&rdquo; Nynaeve whispered incredulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, they do hate it, child. Hate it, and fear it.
When they find a Tairen girl who can channel, they bundle her onto
a ship for Tar Valon before the day is done, with hardly time to
speak goodbyes to her family.&rdquo; The Amyrlin&rsquo;s murmur was bitter with
memory. &ldquo;Yet they hold one of the most powerful focuses of the
Power the world has ever seen, inside their precious Stone. It is
my belief that is why they have collected so many <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em>&mdash;and indeed, anything to do with the Power&mdash;over the years, as if by doing so they can diminish the
existence of the thing they cannot rid themselves of, the thing
that reminds them of their own doom every time they enter the Heart
of the Stone. Their fortress that has broken a hundred armies will
fall as one of the signs the Dragon is Reborn. Not even the only
sign; just one. How that must rankle their proud hearts. Their
downfall will not even be the one great sign of the world&rsquo;s change.
They cannot even ignore it by staying out of the Heart. That is
where Lords of the Land are raised to High Lords, and where they
must perform what they call the Rite of the Guarding four times a
year, claiming that they guard the whole world against the Dragon
by holding <em>Callandor</em>. It must bite at their souls like a
bellyful of live silverpike, and no more than they deserve.&rdquo; She
gave herself a shake, as if realizing she had said far more than
she had intended. &ldquo;Is that all, child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mother,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. <em>Light, it always
comes back to Rand, doesn&rsquo;t it? Always back to the Dragon
Reborn</em>. It was still an effort to think of him that way.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin shifted her stole again, frowning at the
frenzied scurry in the kitchen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to set this aright. I
needed to speak to you without delay, but Laras is a good woman,
and she manages the kitchen and the larders well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve sniffed, and addressed her hands on the spit
handle. &ldquo;Laras is a sour lump of lard, and too handy with that
spoon by half.&rdquo; She thought she had muttered it under her breath,
but she heard the Amyrlin chuckle wryly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a fine judge of character, child. You must
have done well as the Wisdom of your village. It was Laras who went
to Sheriam and demanded to know how long you three are to be kept
to the dirtiest and hardest work, without a turn at lighter. She
said she would not be a party to breaking any woman&rsquo;s health or
spirit, no matter what I said. A fine judge of character,
child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laras came back into the kitchen doorway then,
hesitating to enter her own domain. The Amyrlin went to meet her,
smiles replacing her frowns and stares.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It all looks very well to me, Laras.&rdquo; The Amyrlin&rsquo;s
words came loud enough for the entire kitchen to hear. &ldquo;I see
nothing out of place, and everything as it should be. You are to be
commended. I think I will make Mistress of the Kitchens a formal
title.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stout woman&rsquo;s face fluttered from uneasiness to
shock to beaming pleasure. By the time the Amyrlin swept out of the
kitchen, Laras was all smiles. Her frown returned, though, as she
looked from the Amyrlin&rsquo;s departing back to her workers. The
kitchen seemed to leap into motion. Laras&rsquo; grim stare settled on
Nynaeve.</p>

<p>Turning the spit again, Nynaeve tried smiling at the
big woman.</p>

<p>Laras&rsquo; frown deepened, and she began tapping her
spoon on her thigh, apparently forgetting that for once it had been
used for its intended purpose. It left smears of soup on the white
of her apron.</p>

<p><em>I will smile at her if it kills me</em>, Nynaeve
thought, though she had to grit her teeth to do it.</p>

<p>Egwene and Elayne appeared, twisting their faces and
scrubbing their mouths with their sleeves. At a stare from Laras,
they dashed to the spit and resumed their labors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soap,&rdquo; Elayne muttered thickly, &ldquo;tastes horrid!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene trembled as she spooned juice from the
dripping pan over the roasts. &ldquo;Nynaeve, if you tell me the Amyrlin
told us to stay here, I will scream. I might run away for
real.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We leave after the washing up is done,&rdquo; she told
them, &ldquo;just as quickly as we can fetch our belongings from our
rooms.&rdquo; She wished she could share the eagerness that flashed in
their eyes. <em>Light send we aren&rsquo;t walking into a trap we can&rsquo;t
get out of. Light send it so</em>.</p>
