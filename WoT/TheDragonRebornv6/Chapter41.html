<h4><em>A Hunter&rsquo;s Oath</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">A</span>s
the <em>Snow Goose</em> moved toward the long
stone docks of Illian, sails furled and propelled by its sweeps,
Perrin stood near the stern watching great numbers of long-legged
birds wading in the tall marsh grass that all but encircled the
great harbor. He recognized the small white cranes, and could guess
at their much larger blue brothers, but many of the crested birds&mdash;red-feathered or rosy, some with flat bills broader than a
duck&rsquo;s&mdash;he did not know at all. A dozen sorts of gulls
swooped and soared above the harbor itself, and a black bird with a
long, sharp beak skimmed just above the water, its underbeak
cutting a furrow. Ships three and four times as long as the <em>
Snow Goose</em> lay anchored across the expanse of the harbor,
waiting their turns at the docks, or for the tides to shift so they
could sail beyond the long breakwater. Small fishing boats worked
close to the marsh, and in the creeks winding through it, two or
three men in each dragging nets on long poles swung out from either
side of the boat.</p>

<p>The wind carried a sharp scent of salt, and did
little to break the heat. The sun stood well over halfway down to
the horizon, but it seemed like noon. The air felt damp; it was the
only way he could think of it. Damp. His nose caught the smell of
fresh fish from the boats, of old fish and mud from the marsh, and
the sour stink of a large tanning yard that lay on a treeless
island in the marsh grass.</p>

<p>Captain Adarra muttered something softly behind him,
the tiller creaked, and the <em>Snow Goose</em> changed its course
a trifle. Barefoot men at the sweeps moved as if not wanting to
make a sound. Perrin did not glance at them beyond a flicker of his
eye.</p>

<p>He peered at the tannery, instead, watching men
scrape hides stretched on rows of wooden frames, and other men lift
hides out of huge, sunken vats with long sticks. Sometimes they
stacked the hides on barrows, wheeling them into the long, low
building at the edge of the yard; sometimes the hides went back
into the vats, with an addition of liquids poured from large stone
crocks. They probably made more leather in a day than was made in
Emond&rsquo;s Field in months, and he could see another tannery on
another island beyond the first.</p>

<p>It was not that he had any real interest in ships or
fishing boats or tanning yards, or even very much in the birds&mdash;though he did wonder what those pale red ones could be
fishing for with their flat bills, and some of them looked good to
eat unless he watched himself&mdash;but anything at all was better
than watching the scene behind him on the deck of the <em>Snow
Goose</em>. The axe at his belt was no defense against that. <em>A
stone wall wouldn&rsquo;t be defense enough, he thought</em>.</p>

<p>Moiraine had been neither pleased nor displeased to
discover that Zarine&mdash;<em>I&rsquo;ll not call her Faile, whatever
she wants to name herself! She is no falcon!</em>&mdash;knew she
was Aes Sedai, though she had been perhaps a little upset with him
for not telling her. <em>A little upset. She called me a fool, but
that was all. Then</em>. Moiraine did not seem to care one way or
another about Zarine being a Hunter of the Horn. But once she
learned the girl thought they would lead her to the Horn of Valere,
once she learned he had known that, too, and not told her&mdash;Zarine had been more than forthcoming about both subjects with
Moiraine, to his mind&mdash;then her cold blue stare had taken on
a quality that made him feel as if he had been packed in a barrel
of snow in the dead of winter. The Aes Sedai said nothing, but she
stared too often and too hard for any comfort.</p>

<p>He looked over his shoulder and quickly returned to
studying the shoreline. Zarine was sitting cross-legged on the deck
near the horses tethered between the masts, her bundle and dark
cloak beside her, her narrow, divided skirts neatly arrayed,
pretending to study the rooftops and towers of the oncoming city.
Moiraine was studying Illian, too, from just ahead of the men
working the sweeps, but now and then she shot a hard look at the
girl from under the deep hood of her fine gray wool cloak. <em>How
can she stand wearing that?</em> His own coat was unbuttoned and
his shirt unlaced at the neck.</p>

<p>Zarine met each Aes Sedai look with a smile, but
every time Moiraine turned away, she swallowed and wiped her
forehead.</p>

<p>Perrin rather admired her for managing that smile
when Moiraine was watching. It was a good deal more than he could
do. He had never seen the Aes Sedai truly lose her temper, but he
himself was at the point of wishing she would shout, or rage, or
anything but stare at him. <em>Light, maybe not</em> anything!
Maybe the stare was bearable.</p>

<p>Lan sat further toward the bow than Moiraine&mdash;his color-shifting cloak was still in the saddlebags at his feet&mdash;outwardly absorbed in examining his sword blade, but making
little effort to hide his amusement. Sometimes his lips appeared to
quirk very close to a smile. Perrin was not certain; at times he
thought it was only a shadow. Shadows could make a hammer seem to
smile. Each woman obviously thought she was the object of that
amusement, but the Warder did not appear to mind the tight-lipped
frowns he received from both of them.</p>

<p>A few days earlier Perrin had heard Moiraine ask Lan,
in a voice like ice, whether he saw something to laugh at. &ldquo;I would
never laugh at you, Moiraine Sedai,&rdquo; he had replied calmly, &ldquo;but if
you truly intend to send me to Myrelle, I must become used to
smiling. I hear that Myrelle tells her Warders jokes. Gaidin must
smile at their bond-holder&rsquo;s quips; you have often given me quips
to laugh at, have you not? Perhaps you would rather I stay with you
after all.&rdquo; She had given him a look that would have nailed any
other man to the mast, but the Warder never blinked. Lan made cold
steel seem like tin.</p>

<p>The crew had taken to padding about their work in
utter silence when Moiraine and Zarine were on deck together.
Captain Adarra held his head tilted, and looked as if he were
listening for something he did not want to hear. He passed his
orders in whispers, instead of the shouts he had used at first.
Everyone knew Moiraine was Aes Sedai, now, and everyone knew she
was displeased. Perrin had let himself get into one shouting match
with Zarine, and he was not sure which of them had said the words
&ldquo;Aes Sedai,&rdquo; but the whole crew knew. <em>Bloody woman!</em> He was
uncertain whether he meant Moiraine or Zarine. <em>If she is the
falcon, what is the hawk supposed to be? Am I going to be stuck
with </em>two<em> women like her? Light! No! She is not a falcon, and that
is an end to it!</em> The only good thing he could find in all this
was that with an angry Aes Sedai to worry about, none of the crew
looked twice at his eyes.</p>

<p>Loial was nowhere in sight, at the moment. The Ogier
stayed in his stifling cabin whenever Moiraine and Zarine were
topside together&mdash;working on his notes, he said. He only came
on deck at night, to smoke his pipe. Perrin did see how he could
take the heat; even Moiraine and Zarine were better than being
belowdecks.</p>

<p>He sighed and kept his eyes on Illian. The city the
ship was approaching was large&mdash;as big as Cairhien or
Caemlyn, the only two great cities he had ever seen&mdash;and it
reared out of a huge marsh that stretched for miles like a plain of
waving grass. Illian had no walls at all, but it seemed to be all
towers and palaces. The buildings were all pale stone, except for
some that appeared covered with white plaster, but the stone was
white and gray and reddish and even faint shades of green. Rooftops
of tile sparkled under the sun with a hundred different hues. The
long docks held many ships, most dwarfing the <em>Snow Goose</em>,
and bustled with the loading and unloading of cargo. There were
shipyards at the far end of the city, where great ships stood in
every stage from skeletons of thick wooden ribs to nearly ready to
slide into the harbor.</p>

<p>Perhaps Illian was large enough to keep wolves at
bay. They surely would not hunt in those marshes. The <em>Snow
Goose</em> had outrun the wolves that had followed him from the
mountains. He reached out for them gingerly, now, and felt&mdash;nothing.
A curiously empty feeling, given that it was what he wanted. His
dreams had been his own&mdash;for the most part&mdash;since that
first night. Moiraine had asked about them in a cold voice, and he
had told the truth. Twice he had found himself in that odd sort of
wolf dream, and both times Hopper had appeared, chasing him away,
telling him he was too young yet, too new. What Moiraine made of
that, he had no idea; she told him nothing, except to say he had
best be wary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as well by me,&rdquo; he growled. He was almost
becoming used to Hopper being dead but not dead, in the wolf
dreams, at least. Behind him, he heard Captain Adarra scuff his
boots on the deck and mutter something, startled that anyone would
speak aloud.</p>

<p>Lines were hurled ashore from the ship. While they
were still being made fast to stone posts along the docks, the
slightly built captain leaped into motion, whispering fiercely to
his crew. He had booms rigged to lift the horses onto the wharf
almost as quickly as the gangplank was laid in place. Lan&rsquo;s black
warhorse kicked and nearly broke the boom hoisting him. Loial&rsquo;s
huge, hairy-fetlocked mount needed two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An honor,&rdquo; Adarra whispered to Moiraine with a bow
as she stepped onto the wide plank leading to the dock. &ldquo;An honor
to have served you, Aes Sedai.&rdquo; She strode ashore without looking
at him, her face hidden in her deep hood.</p>

<p>Loial did not appear until everyone else was on the
dock, and the horses, too. The Ogier came thumping up the gangplank
trying to don his long coat while carrying his big saddlebags and
striped blanketroll, and his cloak over one arm. &ldquo;I did not know we
had arrived,&rdquo; he rumbled breathlessly. &ldquo;I was rereading my&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;
He trailed off with a glance at Moiraine. She appeared to be
absorbed in watching Lan saddle Aldieb, but the Ogier&rsquo;s ears
flickered like a nervous cat&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><em>His notes</em>, Perrin thought. <em>One of these
days I have to see what he is saying about all this</em>. Something
tickled the back of his neck, and he jumped a foot before he
realized he was smelling a clean, herbal scent through the spices
and tar and stinks of the docks.</p>

<p>Zarine wiggled her fingers, smiling at them. &ldquo;If I
can do that with just a brush of my fingers, farmboy, I wonder how
high you would jump if I&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was growing a little tired of considering looks
from those dark, tilted eyes. <em>She may be pretty, but she looks
at me the way I&rsquo;d look at a tool I&rsquo;d never seen before, trying to
puzzle out how it was made, and what it is supposed to be used
for</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zarine.&rdquo; Moiraine&rsquo;s voice was cool but
unruffled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am called Faile,&rdquo; Zarine said firmly, and for a
moment, with her bold nose, she did look like a falcon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zarine,&rdquo; Moiraine said firmly, &ldquo;It is time for our
ways to part. You will find better Hunting elsewhere, and
safer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; Zarine said just as firmly. &ldquo;A Hunter
must follow the trail she sees, and no Hunter would ignore the
trail you four leave. And I am Faile.&rdquo; She spoiled it a bit by
swallowing, but she did not blink as she met Moiraine&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you certain?&rdquo; Moiraine said softly. &ldquo;Are you
sure you will not change your mind&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Falcon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not. There is nothing you or your stone-faced
Warder can do to stop me.&rdquo; Zarine hesitated, then added slowly, as
if she had decided to be entirely truthful, &ldquo;At least, there is
nothing that you will do that can stop me. I know a little of Aes
Sedai; I know, for all the stories, that there are things you will
not do. And I do not believe stone-face would do what he must to
make me give over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure enough of that to risk it?&rdquo; Lan spoke
quietly, and his face did not change, but Zarine swallowed
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no need to threaten her, Lan,&rdquo; Perrin said.
He was surprised to realize he was glaring at the Warder.</p>

<p>Moiraine&rsquo;s glance silenced him and the Warder both.
&ldquo;You believe you know what an Aes Sedai will not do, do you?&rdquo; she
said more softly than before. Her smile was not pleasant. &ldquo;If you
wish to go with us, this is what you must do.&rdquo; Lan&rsquo;s eyelids
flickered in surprise; the two women stared at each other like
falcon and mouse, but Zarine was not the falcon, now. &ldquo;You will
swear by your Hunter&rsquo;s oath to do as I say, to heed me, and not to
leave us. Once you know more than you should of what we do, I will
not allow you to fall into the wrong hands. Know that for truth,
girl. You will swear to act as one of us, and do nothing that will
endanger our purpose. You will ask no questions of where we go or
why: you will be satisfied with what I choose to tell you. All of
this you will swear, or you will remain here in Illian. And you
will not leave this marsh until I return to release you, if it
takes the rest of your life. That <em>I</em> swear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zarine turned her head uneasily, watching Moiraine
out of one eye. &ldquo;I may accompany you if I swear?&rdquo; The Aes Sedai
nodded. &ldquo;I will be one of you, the same as Loial or stone-face. But
I can ask no questions. Are they allowed to ask questions?&rdquo;
Moiraine&rsquo;s face lost a little of its patience. Zarine stood up
straighter and held her head high. &ldquo;Very well, then. I swear, by
the oath I took as a Hunter. If I break one, I will have broken
both. I swear it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Done,&rdquo; Moiraine said, touching the younger woman&rsquo;s
forehead; Zarine shivered. &ldquo;Since you brought her to us, Perrin,
she is your responsibility.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mine!&rdquo; he yelped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am no one&rsquo;s responsibility but my own!&rdquo; Zarine
nearly shouted.</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai went serenely on as if they had never
opened their mouths. &ldquo;It seems you have found Min&rsquo;s falcon, <em>
ta&rsquo;veren</em>. I have tried to discourage her, but it appears she
will perch on your shoulder whatever I do. The Pattern weaves a
future for you, it seems. Yet remember this. If I must, I will snip
your thread from the Pattern. And if the girl endangers what must
be, you will share her fate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not ask for her to come along!&rdquo; Perrin
protested. Moiraine calmly mounted Aldieb, adjusting her cloak over
the white mare&rsquo;s saddle. &ldquo;I did not ask for her!&rdquo; Loial shrugged at
him and silently mouthed something. No doubt a saying about the
dangers of angering Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>?&rdquo; Zarine said
disbelievingly. Her gaze ran over his sturdy country clothes and
settled on his yellow eyes. &ldquo;Well, perhaps. Whatever you are, she
threatens you as easily as she does me. Who is Min? What does she
mean, I will perch on your shoulder?&rdquo; Her face tightened. &ldquo;If you
try making me your responsibility, I will carve your ears. Do you
hear me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grimacing, he slipped his unstrung bow under the
saddle girths along Stepper&rsquo;s flank, and climbed into the saddle.
Restive after days on the ship, the dun lived up to his name until
Perrin calmed him with a firm hand on the reins and pats to his
neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of that deserves an answer,&rdquo; he growled. <em>
Min bloody told her! Burn you, Min! Burn you, too, Moiraine! And
Zarine!</em> He could never remember Rand or Mat being bullied by
women on every side. Or himself, before leaving Emond&rsquo;s Field.
Nynaeve had been the only one. And Mistress Luhhan, of course; she
ran him and Master Luhhan both, everywhere but in the smithy. And
Egwene had had a way about her, though mostly with Rand. Mistress
al&rsquo;Vere, Egwene&rsquo;s mother, always had a smile, but things seemed to
end up being done as she wanted, too. And the Women&rsquo;s Circle had
looked over everybody&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>

<p>Grumbling to himself, he reached down and took Zarine
by an arm; she gave a squawk and nearly dropped her bundle as he
hoisted her up behind his saddle. Those divided skirts of hers made
it easy for her to straddle Stepper. &ldquo;Moiraine will have to buy you
a horse,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;You cannot walk the whole way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are strong, blacksmith,&rdquo; Zarine said, rubbing
her arm, &ldquo;but I am not a piece of iron.&rdquo; She shifted around,
stuffing her bundle and her cloak between them. &ldquo;I can buy my own
horse, if I need one. The whole way where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan was already riding off the dock into the city,
with Moiraine and Loial behind him. The Ogier looked back at
Perrin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No questions, remember? And my name is Perrin,
Zarine. Not &lsquo;big man,&rsquo; or &lsquo;blacksmith,&rsquo; or anything else. Perrin.
Perrin Aybara.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And mine is Faile, shaggy-hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With something close to a snarl, he booted Stepper
after the others. Zarine had to throw her arms around his waist to
keep from being tossed over the dun&rsquo;s crupper. He thought she was
laughing.</p>
