<h4><em>Into the Stone</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
rooftops of Tear were no place for a sensible man
to be in the night, Mat decided as he peered into the moon shadows.
A little more than fifty paces of broad street, or perhaps narrow
plaza, separated the Stone from his tiled roof, itself three
stories above the paving stones. <em>But when was I ever sensible?
The only people I ever met who were sensible all the time were so
boring that watching them could put you to sleep</em>. Whether the
thing was a street or a plaza, he had followed it all the way
around the Stone since nightfall; the only place it did not go was
on the river side, where the Erinin ran right along the foot of the
fortress, and nothing interrupted it except the city wall. That
wall was only two houses to his right. So far, the top of the wall
seemed the best path to the Stone, but not one he would be
overjoyed to take.</p>

<p>Picking up his quarterstaff and a small, wire-handled
tin box, he moved carefully to a brick chimney a little nearer the
wall. The roll of fireworks&mdash;what had been the roll of
fireworks before he worked on it back in his room&mdash;shifted on
his back. It was more of a bundle, now, all jammed together as
tight as he could make it, but still too big for carrying around
rooftops in the dark. Earlier, a slip of his foot because of the
thing had sent a roof tile skittering over the edge, and roused the
man sleeping in a room below to bellow &ldquo;thief!&rdquo; and send him
running. He hitched the bundle back into position without thinking
about it, and crouched in the shadows of the chimney. After a
moment he set the tin box down; the wire handle was beginning to
grow uncomfortably warm.</p>

<p>It felt a little safer, studying the Stone from the
shadows, but not much more encouraging. The city wall was not
nearly as thick as those he had seen in other places, in Caemlyn or
Tar Valon, no more than a pace wide, supported by great stone
buttresses cloaked in darkness, now. A pace was more than
sufficient width for walking, of course, except that the fall to
either side was nearly ten spans. Through the dark, to hard
pavement. <em>But some of these bloody houses back right up against
it. I can make it to the top easily enough, and it bloody runs
straight to the bloody Stone!</em></p>

<p>It did that, but that was no particular comfort. The
sides of the Stone looked like cliffs. Eyeing the height again, he
told himself he should be able to climb it. <em>Of course, I can.
Just like those cliffs in the Mountains of Mist</em>. Over a
hundred paces straight up before there was a battlement. There must
be arrowslits lower down, but he could not make them out in the
night. And he could not squeeze through an arrowslit. <em>A hundred
bloody paces. Maybe a hundred and twenty. Burn me, even Rand would
not try to climb that</em>. But it was the one way in he had found.
Every gate he had seen had been shut tight and looked strong enough
to stop a herd of bulls, not to mention the dozen or so soldiers
guarding very nearly every last one, in helmets and breastplates,
and swords at their belts.</p>

<p>Suddenly he blinked, and squinted at the side of the
Stone. There <em>was</em> some fool climbing it, just visible as a
moving shadow in the moonlight, and over halfway up already, with a
drop of seventy paces to the pavement under his feet. <em>Fool, is
he? Well, I&rsquo;m as big a one, because I am going up, too. Burn me,
he&rsquo;ll probably raise an alarm in there and get me caught</em>. He
could not see the climber anymore. <em>Who in the Light is he? What
does it matter who he is? Burn me, but this is a bloody way to win
a wager. I&rsquo;m going to want a kiss from all of them, even
Nynaeve!</em></p>

<p>He shifted to peer toward the wall, trying to choose
his spot to climb, and suddenly there was steel across his throat.
Without thinking, he knocked it away and swept the man&rsquo;s feet out
from under him with his staff. Someone else kicked his own feet
away and he fell almost on top of the man he had knocked down. He
rolled off onto the roof tiles, loosing the bundle of fireworks&mdash;<em>If that falls into the street, I&rsquo;ll break their
necks!</em>&mdash;staff whirling; he felt it strike flesh, and a
second time, heard grunts. Then there were two blades at his
throat.</p>

<p>He froze, arms outflung. The points of short spears,
dull so they hardly caught the faint light of the moon at all,
pressed into his flesh just short of bringing blood. His eyes
followed them up to the faces of whoever was holding them, but
their heads were shrouded, their faces veiled in black except for
their eyes, staring at him. <em>Burn me, I have to run into real
thieves! What happened to my luck?</em></p>

<p>He put on a grin, with plenty of teeth so they could
see it in the moonlight. &ldquo;I do not mean to trouble you in your
work, so if you let me go my way, I&rsquo;ll let you go yours and say
nothing.&rdquo; The veiled men did not move, and neither did their
spears. &ldquo;I want no more outcry than you. I&rsquo;ll not betray you.&rdquo; They
stood like statues, staring down at him. <em>Burn me, I do not have
time for this. Time to toss the dice</em>. For a chilling moment he
thought the words in his head had been strange. He tightened his
grip on the quarterstaff, lying out to one side of him&mdash;and
almost cried out when someone stepped hard on his wrist.</p>

<p>He rolled his eyes to see who. <em>Burn me for a
fool, I forgot the one I fell on</em>. But he saw another shape
moving behind the one standing on his wrist, and decided maybe it
was as well he had not managed to bring the staff into use after
all.</p>

<p>It was a soft boot, laced to the knee, that rested on
his arm: It tugged at his memory. Something about a man met in
mountains. He eyed the night-cloaked shape the rest of the way up,
trying to make out the cut and colors of his clothes&mdash;they
seemed all shadow, colors that blended with the darkness too well
to see them clearly&mdash;past a long-bladed knife at the fellow&rsquo;s
waist, right up to the dark veil across his face. A black-veiled
face. Black-veiled.</p>

<p><em>Aiel! Burn me, what are bloody Aiel doing
here!</em> He had a sinking feeling in his stomach as he remembered
hearing that Aiel veiled themselves when they killed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said a man&rsquo;s voice, &ldquo;we are Aiel.&rdquo; Mat gave a
start; he had not realized he had spoken aloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You dance well for one caught by surprise,&rdquo; a young
woman&rsquo;s voice said. He thought she was the one standing on his
wrist. &ldquo;Perhaps another day I will have time to dance with you
properly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He started to smile&mdash;<em>If she wants to dance,
they can&rsquo;t be going to kill me, at least!</em>&mdash;then frowned
instead. He seemed to remember Aiel sometimes meant something
different when they said that.</p>

<p>The spears were pulled back, and hands hauled him to
his feet. He shook them away and brushed himself off as if he were
standing in a common room instead of on a night-cloaked rooftop
with four Aiel. It always paid to let the other man know you had a
steady nerve. The Aiel had quivers at their waists as well as
knives, and more of those short spears on their backs with cased
bows, the long spear points sticking up above their shoulders. He
heard himself humming &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Down at the Bottom of the Well,&rdquo; and
stopped it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you do here?&rdquo; the man&rsquo;s voice asked. With
the veils, Mat was not entirely sure which one had spoken; the
voice sounded older, confident, used to command. He thought he
could pick out the woman, at least; she was the only one shorter
than he, and that not by much. The others all stood a head taller
than he or more. <em>Bloody Aiel</em>, he thought. &ldquo;We have watched
you for some little time,&rdquo; the older man went on, &ldquo;watched you
watch the Stone. You have studied it from every side. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could ask the same of all of you,&rdquo; another voice
said. Mat was the only one who gave a start as a man in baggy
breeches stepped out of the shadows. The fellow appeared to be
shoeless, for better footing on the tiles. &ldquo;I expected to find
thieves, not Aiel,&rdquo; the man went on, &ldquo;but do not think your numbers
frighten me.&rdquo; A slim staff no taller than his head made a blur and
a hum as he whirled it. &ldquo;My name is Juilin Sandar, and I am a
thief-catcher, and I would know why you are on the rooftops,
staring at the Stone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat shook his head. <em>How many bloody people are on
the roofs tonight?</em> All that was needed was for Thom to appear
and play his harp, or someone to come looking for an inn. <em>A
bloody thief-taker!</em> He wondered why the Aiel were just
standing there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You stalk well, for a city man,&rdquo; the older man&rsquo;s
voice said. &ldquo;But why do you follow us? We have stolen nothing. Why
have you looked so often at the Stone tonight yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even in the moonlight this Sandar&rsquo;s surprise was
evident. He gave a start, opened his mouth&mdash;and closed it
again as four more Aiel rose out of the dimness behind him. With a
sigh, he leaned on his slender staff. &ldquo;It seems I am caught
myself,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;It seems <em>I</em> must answer <em>
your</em> questions.&rdquo; He peered toward the Stone, then shook his
head. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;did a thing today that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;troubles me.&rdquo; He
sounded almost as though he were talking to himself, trying to
puzzle it out. &ldquo;Part of me says it was right, what I did, that I
must obey. Surely, it seemed right when I did it. But a small voice
tells me I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;betrayed something. I am certain this voice is
wrong, and it is very small, but it will not stop.&rdquo; He stopped then
himself, shaking his head again.</p>

<p>One of the Aiel nodded, and spoke with the older man&rsquo;s
voice. &ldquo;I am Rhuarc, of the Nine Valleys sept of the Taardad Aiel,
and once I was <em>Aethan Dor</em>, a Red Shield. Sometimes the Red
Shields do as your thief-catchers do. I say this so you will
understand that I know what it is you do, and the kind of man you
must be. I mean no harm to you, Juilin Sandar of the
thief-catchers, nor to the people of your city, but you will not be
suffered to raise the armcry. If you will keep silence, you will
live; if not, not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean no harm to the city,&rdquo; Sandar said slowly.
&ldquo;Why are you here, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Stone.&rdquo; Rhuarc&rsquo;s tone made it plain that was all
he meant to say.</p>

<p>After a moment Sandar nodded, and muttered, &ldquo;I could
almost wish you had the power to harm the Stone, Rhuarc. I will
hold my tongue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rhuarc turned his veiled face to Mat. &ldquo;And you,
nameless youngling? Will you tell me now why you watch the Stone so
closely?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just wanted a walk in the moonlight,&rdquo; Mat said
lightly. The young woman put her spearpoint to his throat again; he
tried not to swallow. <em>Well, maybe I can tell them something of
it</em>. He must not let them know he was shaken; if you let the
other fellow know that, you lost whatever edge you might have. Very
carefully, with two fingers, he moved her steel away from him. It
seemed to him that she laughed softly. &ldquo;Some friends of mine are
inside the Stone,&rdquo; he said, trying to sound casual. &ldquo;Prisoners. I
mean to bung them out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alone, nameless one?&rdquo; Rhuarc said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be anyone else,&rdquo; Mat
said dryly. &ldquo;Unless you care to help? You seem interested in the
Stone yourself. If you mean to go into it, perhaps we could go
together. It is a tight roll of the dice any way you look at it,
but my luck runs good.&rdquo; <em>So far, anyway. I&rsquo;ve run into
black-veiled Aiel and they have not cut my throat; luck cannot get
much better than that. Burn me, it would not be bad to have a few
Aiel along with me in there</em>. &ldquo;You could do worse than betting
on my luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are not here for prisoners, gambler,&rdquo; Rhuarc
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is time, Rhuarc.&rdquo; Mat could not tell from which
of the Aiel that came, but Rhuarc nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Gaul.&rdquo; He looked from Mat to Sandar and back.
&ldquo;Do not give the armcry.&rdquo; He turned away, and in two steps he had
blended into the night.</p>

<p>Mat gave a start. The other Aiel were gone, too,
leaving him alone with the thief-taker. <em>Unless they left
somebody to watch us. Burn me, how could I tell if they did?</em>
&ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t mean to try stopping me, either,&rdquo; he told Sandar
as he slung the bundle of fireworks on his back again and picked up
his quarterstaff. &ldquo;I mean to go inside, by you or through you, one
way or the other.&rdquo; He went over to the chimney to pick up the tin
box; the wire handle was more than warm, now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These friends of yours,&rdquo; Sandar said. &ldquo;They are
three women?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat frowned at him, wishing there was enough light to
show the man&rsquo;s face clearly. The fellow&rsquo;s voice sounded odd. &ldquo;What
do you know of them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know they are inside the Stone. And I know a small
gate near the river where a thief-catcher can gain entrance with a
prisoner, to take him to the cells. The cells where they must be.
If you will trust me, gambler, I can take us that far. What happens
after that is up to chance. Perhaps your luck will bring us out
again alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have always been lucky,&rdquo; Mat said slowly. <em>Do I
feel lucky enough to trust him?</em> He did not much like the idea
of pretending to be a prisoner; it seemed too easy for pretense to
become reality. But it seemed no bigger risk than trying to climb
three hundred feet or more straight up in the dark.</p>

<p>He glanced toward the city wall, and stared. Shadows
flowed along it; dim shapes trotting. Aiel, he was sure. There must
have been over a hundred. They vanished, but now he could make out
shadows moving on the cliff face that was the sheer side of the
Stone of Tear. So much for going up that way. That one fellow
earlier might have made it inside without raising an alarm&mdash;Rhuarc&rsquo;s armcry&mdash;but a hundred or more Aiel would have to be
like sounding bells. They might make a diversion, though. If they
caused a commotion somewhere up there, inside the Stone, then
whoever was guarding the cells might not pay as much attention to a
thief-taker bringing a thief.</p>

<p><em>I might as well add a little to the confusion. I
worked hard enough on it</em>. &ldquo;Very well, thief-taker. Just don&rsquo;t
decide I am a real prisoner at the last minute. We can start for
your gate as soon as I stir the anthill a bit.&rdquo; He thought Sandar
frowned, but he did not mean to tell the man more than he had
to.</p>

<p>Sandar followed him across the rooftops, climbing to
higher levels as easily as he did. The last roof was only a little
lower than the top of the wall and ran right up to it, a matter of
pulling himself up rather than climbing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; Sandar whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait here for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With the tin box dangling from one hand by its wire
handle and his quarterstaff held horizontally in front of him, Mat
took a deep breath and started toward the Stone. He tried not to
think of how far it was to the pavement below. <em>Light, the
bloody thing is three feet wide! I could walk it with a bloody
blindfold, in my sleep!</em> Three feet wide, in the dark, and
better than fifty feet to the pavement. He tried not to think about
Sandar not being there when he came back, either. He was all but
committed to this fool notion of pretending to be a thief caught by
the man, but it seemed all too probable that he would return to the
roof to find Sandar gone, maybe bringing more men to make him a
prisoner in truth. <em>Don&rsquo;t think about it. just do the job at
hand. At least I&rsquo;ll finally see what it is like</em>.</p>

<p>As he had suspected, there was an arrowslit in the
wall of the Stone right at the end of the wall, a deep wedge cut
into the rock holding a tall, narrow opening for an archer to shoot
through. If the Stone were attacked, the soldiers inside would want
some way to stop any trying to follow this path. The slit was dark,
now. There did not appear to be anyone watching. That was something
he had tried not to think about, too.</p>

<p>Quickly he set down the tin box at his feet, balanced
his quarterstaff across the wall right against the side of the
Stone, and unslung the bundle from his back. Hurriedly he wedged it
into the slit, forcing it in as far as he could; he wanted as much
of the noise to be inside as he could manage. Pulling aside a
corner of the oiled cloth cover revealed knotted fuses. After a
little thinking, back in his room, he had cut the longer fuses to
match the shortest, using the pieces to help tie all the fuses
together. It seemed they should all go off at once, and a
bang-and-flash like that should be enough to pull everyone who was
not completely deaf.</p>

<p>The lid of the tin box was hot enough that he had to
blow on his fingers twice before he could pry it off&mdash;he
wished he had whatever Aludra&rsquo;s trick had been, lighting that
lantern so easily&mdash;to expose the dark bit of charcoal inside,
lying on a bed of sand. The wire handle came off to make tongs, and
a little blowing had the coal glowing red again. He touched the hot
coal to the knotted fuses, let tongs and coal fall over the side of
the wall as the fuses hissed into flame, snatched up his
quarterstaff and darted back along the wall.</p>

<p><em>This is crazy</em>, he thought as he ran. <em>I
don&rsquo;t care how big a bang it makes. I could break my fool neck
doing thi&mdash;!</em></p>

<p>The roar behind him was louder than anything he had
ever heard in his life; a monstrous fist punched him in the back,
knocking all the wind out of him even before he landed, sprawled on
his belly on the wall top, barely holding on to his staff as it
swung over the edge. For a moment he lay there, trying to make his
lungs work again, trying not to think how he <em>must</em> have used up all
his luck this time by not falling off the wall. His ears rang like
all the bells in Tar Valon.</p>

<p>Pushing himself up carefully, he looked back toward
the Stone. A cloud of smoke hung around the arrowslit. Behind the
smoke, the shadowed shape of the arrowslit itself seemed different.
Larger. He did not understand how or why, but it did seem
larger.</p>

<p>He only thought for a moment. At one end of the wall
Sandar might be waiting, might be intending to take him into the
Stone as a pretend prisoner&mdash;or might be hurrying back with
soldiers. At the other end of the wall, there might be a way inside
without any chance of Sandar betraying him. He darted back the way
he had just come, no longer worrying about the darkness or the drop
to either side.</p>

<p>The arrowslit <em>was</em> larger, most of the
thinner stone at the middle simply gone, leaving a rough hole as if
someone had hammered at it with a sledge for hours. A hole just big
enough for a man. <em>How in the Light?</em> There was no time for
wondering.</p>

<p>He pushed through the jagged opening, coughing at the
acrid smoke, jumped to the floor inside, and had run a dozen steps
before Defenders of the Stone appeared, at least ten of them, all
shouting in confusion. Most wore only their shirts, and none had
helmet or breastplate. Some carried lanterns. Some held bared
swords.</p>

<p><em>Fool!</em> he shouted inside his head. <em>This
is why you set the bloody things off in the first place!
Light-blinded fool!</em></p>

<p>He had no time to make it back out onto the wall.
Quarterstaff spinning, he threw himself at the soldiers before they
had a chance to do more than see he was there, hurled himself into
them, smashing at heads, swords, knees, whatever he could reach,
knowing they were too many for him to handle alone, knowing that
his fool toss of the dice had cost Egwene and the others whatever
chance he might have had.</p>

<p>Suddenly Sandar was there beside him, in the light of
lanterns dropped by men clawing for their swords, his slender staff
whirling even faster than Mat&rsquo;s quarterstaff. Caught between two
staffmen, taken by surprise, the soldiers went down like pins in a
game of bowls.</p>

<p>Sandar stared at the fallen men, shaking his head.
&ldquo;Defenders of the Stone. I have attacked Defenders! They will have
my head for&mdash;! What was it that you did, gambler? That flash
of light, and thunder, breaking stone. Did you call lightning?&rdquo; His
voice fell to a whisper. &ldquo;Have I joined myself to a man who can
channel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fireworks,&rdquo; Mat said curtly. His ears were still
ringing, but he could hear more boots coming, running boots
thudding on stone. &ldquo;The cells, man! Show me the way to the cells
before any more get here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sandar shook himself. &ldquo;This way!&rdquo; He dashed down a
side hall, away from the oncoming boots. &ldquo;We must hurry! They will
kill us if they find us!&rdquo; Somewhere above, gongs began to sound an
alarm, and more thundered echoes through the Stone.</p>

<p><em>I&rsquo;m coming</em>, Mat thought as he ran after the
thief-taker. <em>I&rsquo;ll get you out or die! I promise it!</em></p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The alarm gongs sent echoes crashing through the
Stone, but Rand paid no more attention to them than he had to the
roar that had come before, like muffled thunder from somewhere
below. His side ached; the old wound burned, strained almost to
tearing by the climb up the side of the fortress. He gave the pain
no heed, either. A crooked smile was fixed on his face, a smile of
anticipation and dread he could not have wiped away if he had
wanted to. It was close, now. What he had dreamed of. <em>
Callandor</em>.</p>

<p><em>I will finish it at last. One way or another, it
will be done with. The dreams, finished. The baiting, and the
taunting, and the hunting. I&rsquo;ll finish it all!</em></p>

<p>Laughing to himself, he hurried through the dark
corridors of the Stone of Tear.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Egwene put a hand to her face, wincing. Her mouth had
a bitter taste, and she was thirsty. <em>Rand? What? Why was I
dreaming about Mat again, all mixed with Rand, and shouting that he
was coming? What?</em></p>

<p>She opened her eyes, stared at the gray stone walls,
one smoky rush torch casting flickering shadows, and screamed as
she remembered it all. &ldquo;No! I will not be chained again! I won&rsquo;t be
collared! No!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve and Elayne were beside her in an instant,
their bruised faces too worried and fearful for the soothing sounds
they made to be believed. But just the fact that they were there
was enough to still her screams. She was not alone. A prisoner, but
not alone. And not collared.</p>

<p>She tried to sit up, and they helped her. They had to
help her; she ached in every muscle. She could remember every
unseen blow during the frenzy that had all but driven her mad when
she realized&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>I will not think about that. I have to think
about how we are to escape</em>. She slid backwards until she could
lean against a wall. Her pains fought with weariness; that struggle
when she had refused to give in had taken every last scrap of her
strength, and the bruises seemed to sap even more.</p>

<p>The cell was absolutely empty except for the three of
them and the torch. The floor was bare, and cold, and hard. The
door of rough planks, splintered as if countless futile fingers had
clawed at it, was the only break in the walls. Messages had been
scratched in the stone, most by unsteady hands. The Light have
mercy and let me die, one read. She blanked that out of her
head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we still shielded?&rdquo; she mumbled. Even talking
hurt. Even as Elayne nodded, she realized she had not had to ask.
The swollen cheek on the golden-haired woman, her split lip and
black eye, were answer enough, even if her own pains had not been.
If Nynaeve had been able to reach the True Source, they surely
would have been Healed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have tried,&rdquo; Nynaeve said despairingly. &ldquo;I have
tried, and tried, and tried.&rdquo; She gave her braid a sharp tug, anger
seeping through despite the hopeless fear in her voice. &ldquo;One of
them is sitting outside. Amico, that milk-faced chit, if they have
not changed since we were thrown in here. I suppose one is enough
to maintain the shielding once it has been woven.&rdquo; She barked a
bitter laugh. &ldquo;For all the pains they took&mdash;and gave!&mdash;to take us, you would think we were of no importance at all. It has
been hours since they slammed that door behind us, and no one has
come to ask a question, or look, or even bring a drop of water.
Perhaps they mean to leave us here until we die of thirst.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bait.&rdquo; Elayne&rsquo;s voice quavered, though she was
obviously trying to sound unafraid. And failing miserably.
&ldquo;Liandrin said we are bait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bait for what?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked shakily. &ldquo;Bait for
who? If I am bait, I&rsquo;d like to shove myself down their throats till
they choke on me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand.&rdquo; Egwene stopped to swallow; even a drop of
water would be welcome. &ldquo;I dreamed about Rand, and <em>
Callandor</em>. I think he is coming here.&rdquo; <em>But why did I dream
of Mat? And Perrin? It was a wolf, but I am sure it was him</em>.
&ldquo;Do not be so afraid,&rdquo; she said, trying to sound confident. &ldquo;We
will escape them somehow. If we could better the Seanchan, we can
best Liandrin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve and Elayne exchanged looks over her. Nynaeve
said, &ldquo;Liandrin said thirteen Myrddraal are coming, Egwene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She found herself staring at that message scratched
on the stone wall again: The Light have mercy and let me die. Her
hands clenched into fists. Her jaws cramped with the effort of not
screaming those words. <em>Better to die. Better death than being
turned to the Shadow, made to serve the Dark One!</em></p>

<p>She realized that one of her hands had tightened
around the pouch at her belt. She could feel the two rings inside,
the small circle of the Great Serpent and the larger, twisted stone
ring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They did not take the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>,&rdquo; she
said wonderingly. She fumbled it out of her pouch. It lay heavily
on her palm, all stripes and flecks of color, a ring with only one
edge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were not even important enough to search,&rdquo; Elayne
sighed. &ldquo;Egwene, are you certain Rand is coming here? I would much
rather free myself than wait for the chance of him, but if there is
anyone who can defeat Liandrin and the rest of them, it must be
him. The Dragon Reborn is meant to wield <em>Callandor</em>. He
<em>must</em> be able to defeat them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not if we pull him into a cage after us,&rdquo; Nynaeve
muttered. &ldquo;Not if they have a trap set he does not see. Why are you
staring at that ring, Egwene? <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> will not help
us now. Not unless you can dream a way out of here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I can,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;I could channel in
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. Their shielding won&rsquo;t stop me reaching it.
All I need do is sleep, not channel. And I am surely weary enough
to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne frowned, wincing as it pulled her bruises. &ldquo;I
will take any chance, but how can you channel even in a dream, cut
off from the True Source? And if you can, how can it help us
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know, Elayne. Just because I am shielded
here does not mean I am shielded in the World of Dreams. It is at
least worth a try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Nynaeve said worriedly. &ldquo;I will take any
chance, too, but you saw Liandrin and the others the last time you
used that ring. And you said they saw you, too. What if they are
there again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope they are,&rdquo; Egwene said grimly. &ldquo;I hope they
are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clutching the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> in her hand, she
closed her eyes. She could feel Elayne smoothing her hair, hear her
murmuring softly. Nynaeve began to hum that wordless lullaby from
her childhood; for once, she felt no anger at it at all. The soft
sounds and touches soothed her, let her surrender to her weariness,
let sleep come.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">She wore blue silk this time, but she barely noticed
more than that. Soft breezes caressed her unbruised face, and sent
the butterflies swirling above the wildflowers. Her thirst was
gone, her aches. She reached out to embrace <em>saidar</em> and was
filled with the One Power. Even the triumph she felt at succeeding
was small beside the surging of the Power through her.</p>

<p>Reluctantly she made herself release it, closed her
eyes, and filled the emptiness with a perfect image of the Heart of
the Stone. That was the one place in the Stone she could picture
aside from her cell, and how to distinguish one featureless cubicle
from another? When she opened her eyes, she was there. But she was
not alone.</p>

<p>The form of Joiya Byir stood before <em>
Callandor</em>, her shape so insubstantial that the surging light
of the sword shone through her. The crystal sword no longer merely
glittered with refracted light. In pulses it glowed, as if some
light inside it were being uncovered, then covered and uncovered
again. The Black sister started with surprise and spun to face
Egwene. &ldquo;How? You are shielded! Your Dreaming is at an end!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before the first words were out of the woman&rsquo;s mouth,
Egwene reached for <em>saidar</em> again, wove the complicated flow
of Spirit as she remembered it being used against her, and cut
Joiya Byir off from the Source. The Darkfriend&rsquo;s eyes widened,
those cruel eyes so incongruous in that beautiful, kindly face, but
Egwene was already weaving Air. The other woman&rsquo;s form might seem
like mist, but the bonds held it. It seemed to Egwene that there
was no effort involved in holding both flows in their weaving.
There was sweat on Joiya Byir&rsquo;s forehead as she walked closer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>!&rdquo; Fear was plain on
the woman&rsquo;s face, but her voice fought to hide it. &ldquo;That must be
it. A <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> that escaped us, and one that does not
require channeling. Do you think it will do you any good, girl?
Whatever you do here, it cannot affect what happens in the real
world. <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> is a dream! When I wake, I will take
your <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> from you myself. Be careful what you do,
lest I have reason to be angry when I come to your cell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene smiled at her. &ldquo;Are you certain you will wake,
Darkfriend? If your <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> requires channeling, why
did you not wake as soon as I shielded you? Perhaps you cannot wake
so long as you are shielded here.&rdquo; Her smile faded away; the effort
of smiling at this woman was more than she could bear. &ldquo;A woman
once showed me a scar she received in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>,
Darkfriend. What happens here is still real when you wake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sweat rolled down the Black sister&rsquo;s smooth,
ageless face, now. Egwene wondered if she thought she was about to
die. She almost wished she were cruel enough to do that. Most of
the unseen blows she had received had come from this woman, like a
pounding of fists, for no reason more than that she had kept trying
to crawl away, no reason more than that she had refused to give
up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A woman who can give such beatings,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;should have no objections to a milder one.&rdquo; She wove another flow
of Air quickly; Joiya Byir&rsquo;s dark eyes bulged in disbelief as the
first blow landed across her hips. Egwene saw how to adjust the
weaving so she did not have to maintain it. &ldquo;You will remember
this, and feel it, when you waken. When I allow you to waken.
Remember this, too. If you ever even try to beat me again, I will
return you here and leave you for the rest of your life!&rdquo; The Black
sister&rsquo;s eyes stared hate at her, but there was a suggestion of
tears in them, too.</p>

<p>Egwene felt a moment of shame. Not at what she was
doing to Joiya&mdash;the woman deserved every blow, if not for her
own beating, then for the deaths in the Tower&mdash;not that, not
really, but because she had spent time on her own revenge while
Nynaeve and Elayne were sitting in a cell hoping against hope that
she might be able to rescue them.</p>

<p>She tied off and set the flows of her weavings before
she knew she had done it, then paused to study what she had done.
Three separate weavings, and not only had it been no trouble to
hold them all at once, but now she had done something so they would
maintain themselves. She thought she could remember how, too. And
it might be useful.</p>

<p>After a moment, she unraveled one of the weavings,
and the Darkfriend sobbed as much from relief as from pain. &ldquo;I am
not like you,&rdquo; Egwene said. &ldquo;This is the second time I have done
something like this, and I do not like it. I am going to have to
learn to cut throats instead.&rdquo; From the Black sister&rsquo;s face, she
thought Egwene meant to start learning with her.</p>

<p>Making a disgusted sound, Egwene left her standing
there, trapped and shielded, and hurried into the forest of
polished redstone columns. There had to be a way down to the cells
somewhere.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The stone corridor fell silent as the final dying
scream was cut off by Young Bull&rsquo;s jaws closing on the two-legs&rsquo;s
throat, crushing it. The blood was bitter on his tongue.</p>

<p>He knew this was the Stone of Tear, though he could
not say how he knew. The two-legs lying around him, one kicking his
last with Hopper&rsquo;s teeth buried in his throat, had smelled rank
with fear as they fought. They had smelled confused. He did not
think they had known where they were&mdash;they certainly did not
belong in the wolf dream&mdash;but they had been set to keep him
from that tall door ahead, with its iron lock. To guard it, at
least. They had seemed startled to see wolves. He thought they had
been startled at being there themselves.</p>

<p>He wiped his mouth, then stared at his hand with a
momentary lack of comprehension. He was a man again. He was Perrin.
Back in his own body, in the blacksmith&rsquo;s vest, with the heavy
hammer at his side.</p>

<p><em>We must hurry, Young Bull. There is something
evil near</em>.</p>

<p>Perrin pulled the hammer from his belt as he strode
to the door. &ldquo;Faile must be here.&rdquo; One sharp blow shattered the
lock. He kicked open the door.</p>

<p>The room was empty except for a long stone block in
the middle of the floor. Faile lay on that block as if sleeping,
her black hair spread out like a fan, her body so wrapped in chains
that it took him a moment to realize she was unclothed. Every chain
was held to the stone by a thick bolt.</p>

<p>He was hardly aware of crossing the space until his
hand touched her face, tracing her cheekbone with a finger.</p>

<p>She opened her eyes and smiled up at him. &ldquo;I kept
dreaming you would come, blacksmith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will have you free in a moment, Faile.&rdquo; He raised
his hammer, smashed one of the bolts as if it were wood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was sure of it. Perrin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As his name faded from her tongue, she faded, too.
With a clatter, the chains dropped to the stone where she had
been.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I found her!&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>The dream is not like the world of flesh, Young
Bull. Here, the same hunt can have many endings</em>.</p>

<p>He did not turn to look at Hopper. He knew his teeth
were bared in a snarl. Again he raised the hammer, brought it down
with all his strength against the chains that had held Faile. The
stone block cracked in two under his blow; the Stone itself rang
like a stuck bell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I will hunt again,&rdquo; he growled.</p>

<p>Hammer in hand, Perrin strode out of the room with
Hopper beside him. The Stone was a place of men. And men, he knew,
were crueler hunters than ever wolves were.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Alarm gongs somewhere above sent sonorous clangs down
the corridor, not quite drowning out the ring of metal on metal and
the shouts of fighting men rather closer. The Aiel and the
Defenders, Mat suspected. Tall, golden lamp stands, each with four
golden lamps, lined the hall where Mat was, and silk tapestries of
battle scenes hung on the polished stone walls. There were even
silk carpets on the floor, dark red on dark blue, woven in the
Tairen maze. For once, Mat was too busy to put a price on
anything.</p>

<p><em>This bloody fellow is good</em>, he thought as he
managed to sweep a sword thrust away from him, but the blow he
aimed at the man&rsquo;s head with the other end of the staff had to turn
into another block of that darting blade. <em>I wonder if he is one
of these bloody High Lords?</em> He almost managed a solid blow at
a knee, but his opponent sprang back, his straight blade raised on
guard.</p>

<p>The blue-eyed man certainly wore the puffy-sleeved
coat, yellow with thread-of-gold stripes, but it was all undone,
his shirt only half tucked into his breeches, and his feet bare.
His short-cropped, dark hair was tousled, like that of a man roused
hastily from sleep, but he did not fight like it. Five minutes ago
he had come darting out from one of the tall, carved doors that
lined this hall, a scabbardless sword in his hands, and Mat was
only grateful the fellow had appeared in front of them and not
behind. He was not the first man dressed so that Mat had faced
already, but he was surely the best.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you make it past me, thief-catcher?&rdquo; Mat called,
careful not to take his eyes off the man waiting for him with blade
poised to strike. Sandar had insisted irritably on &ldquo;thief-catcher,&rdquo;
not &ldquo;thief-taker,&rdquo; though Mat could not see any difference.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; Sandar called from behind him. &ldquo;If you
move to let me by, you will lose room to swing that oar you call a
staff, and he will spit you like a grunt.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Like a what?</em> &ldquo;Well, think of something,
Tairen. This ragamuffin is grating my nerves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man in the gold-striped coat sneered. &ldquo;You will
be honored to die on the blade of the High Lord Darlin, peasant, if
I allow it so.&rdquo; It was the first time he had deigned to speak.
&ldquo;Instead, I think I will have the pair of you hung by the heels,
and watch while the skin is stripped from your bodies&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think I&rsquo;d like that,&rdquo; Mat said.</p>

<p>The High Lord&rsquo;s face reddened with indignation at
being interrupted, but Mat gave him no time for any outraged
comment. Quarterstaff whirling in a tight double-loop weave, so
quick the staff blurred at the ends, he leaped forward. It was all
a snarling Darlin could do to keep the staff from him. For the
moment. Mat knew he could not keep this up very long, and if he was
lucky then, it would all go back to the strike and counterstrike.
If he was lucky. But he had no intention of counting on luck this
time. As soon as the High Lord had a moment to set himself in a
pattern of defense, Mat altered his attack in mid-whirl. The end of
the staff Darlin had been expecting at his head dipped instead to
sweep his legs out from under him. The other end did strike at his
head then, as he fell, a sharp crack that rolled his eyes back up
in his head.</p>

<p>Panting, Mat leaned on his staff over the unconscious
High Lord. <em>Burn me, if I have to fight one or two more like
this, I&rsquo;ll bloody well fall over from exhaustion! The stories do
not tell you being a hero it such hard work! Nynaeve always did
find a way to make me work</em>.</p>

<p>Sandar came to stand beside him, frowning down at the
crumpled High Lord. &ldquo;He does not look so mighty lying there,&rdquo; he
said wonderingly. &ldquo;He does not look so much greater than me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat gave a start and peered down the hall, where a
man had just gone trotting across along a joining corridor. <em>
Burn me, if I did not know it was crazy, I would swear that was
Rand!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Sandar, you find that&mdash;&rdquo; he began, swinging his
staff up onto his shoulder, and cut off when it thudded into
something.</p>

<p>Spinning, he found himself facing another
half-dressed High Lord, this one with his sword on the floor, his
knees buckling, and both hands to his head where Mat&rsquo;s staff had
split his scalp. Hastily, Mat poked him hard in the stomach with
the butt of the staff to bring his hands down, then gave him
another thump on the head to put him down in a heap on top of his
sword.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Luck, Sandar,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;You cannot beat bloody
luck. Now, why don&rsquo;t you find this bloody private way the High
Lords take down to the cells?&rdquo; Sandar had insisted there was such a
stairway, and using it would avoid having to run through most of
the Stone. Mat did not think he liked men so eager to watch people
put to the question that they wanted a quick route to the prisoners
from their apartments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just be glad you <em>were</em> so lucky,&rdquo; Sandar
said unsteadily, &ldquo;or this one would have killed us both before we
saw him. I know the door is here somewhere. Are you coming? Or do
you mean to wait for another High Lord to appear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lead on.&rdquo; Mat stepped over the unconscious High
Lord. &ldquo;I am no bloody hero.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trotting, he followed the thief-catcher, who peered
at the tall doors they passed, muttering that he knew it was here
somewhere.</p>
