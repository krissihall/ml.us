<h4><em>Questions</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">E</span>gwene
lay across Nynaeve&rsquo;s bed, chin in her hands,
watching Nynaeve pace back and forth. Elayne sprawled in front of
the fireplace, which was still full of the ashes of last night&rsquo;s
fire. Yet again Elayne was studying the list of names Verin had
produced, patiently reading every word one more time. The other
pages, the list of <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, sat on the table; after
one shocked reading they had not discussed that one further, though
they had talked of everything else. And argued, too.</p>

<p>Egwene stifled a yawn. It was only the middle of the
morning, but none of them had gotten much sleep. They had had to be
up early. For the kitchens, and breakfast. For other things that
she refused to think about. The little sleep she herself had
managed had been filled with unpleasant dreams. <em>Maybe Anaiya
could help me understand them, those that need understanding,
but</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>But what if she is Black Ajah?</em> After
staring at every woman in that chamber last night, wondering which
was Black Ajah, she was finding trust for anyone but her two
companions hard to come by. But she did wish she had some way of
interpreting those dreams.</p>

<p>The nightmares about what had happened inside the
<em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> last night were easy enough to understand,
though they had made her wake up weeping. She had dreamed of the
Seanchan, too, of women in dresses with lightning bolts woven on
their breasts, collaring a long line of women who wore Great
Serpent rings, forcing them to call lightning against the White
Tower. That had started her awake in a cold sweat, but that had to
be just a nightmare, too. And the dream about Whitecloaks binding
her father&rsquo;s hands. A nightmare brought on by homesickness, she
supposed. But the others&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She glanced at the other two women again. Elayne was
still reading. Nynaeve still paced with that steady tread.</p>

<p>There had been a dream of Rand, reaching for a sword
that seemed to be made of crystal, never seeing the fine net
dropping over him. And one of him kneeling in a chamber where a
parched wind blew dust across the floor, and creatures like the
one on the Dragon banner, but much smaller, floated on that wind,
and settled into his skin. There had been a dream of him walking
down into a great hole in a black mountain, a hole filled with a
reddish glare as from vast fires below, and even a dream of him
confronting Seanchan.</p>

<p>About that last, she was uncertain, but she knew the
others had to mean something. Back when she had been sure she could
trust Anaiya, back before she had left the Tower, before she
learned the reality of the Black Ajah, a little cautious
questioning of the Aes Sedai&mdash;done, oh, so carefully, so
Anaiya would think it no more than the curiosity she showed about
other things&mdash;had revealed that a Dreamer&rsquo;s dreams about <em>
ta&rsquo;veren</em> were almost always significant, and the more strongly
<em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, the more &ldquo;almost always&rdquo; became &ldquo;certainly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Mat and Perrin were <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, too, and
she had also dreamed of them. Odd dreams, even more difficult to
understand than the dreams of Rand. Perrin with a falcon on his
shoulder, and Perrin with a hawk. Only the hawk held a leash in her
talons&mdash;Egwene was somehow convinced both hawk and falcon
were female&mdash;and the hawk was trying to fasten it around
Perrin&rsquo;s neck. That made her shiver even now; she did not like
dreams about leashes. And that dream of Perrin&mdash;with a beard!&mdash;leading a huge pack of wolves that stretched as far as the
eye could see. Those about Mat had been even nastier. Mat, placing
his own left eye on a balance scale. Mat, hanging by his neck from
a tree limb. There had been a dream of Mat and Seanchan, too, but
she was willing to dismiss that as a nightmare. It had to have been
just a nightmare. Just like the one about Mat speaking the Old
Tongue. That had to come from what she had heard during his
Healing.</p>

<p>She sighed, and the sigh turned into another yawn.
She and the others had gone to his room after breakfast to see how
he was, but he had not been there.</p>

<p><em>He is probably well enough to go dancing. Light,
now I will probably dream about him dancing with Seanchan! No more
dreams</em>, she told herself firmly. <em>Not now. I will think
about them when I am not so tired</em>. She thought of the
kitchens, of the midday meal soon to come, and then supper, and
breakfast again tomorrow, and pots and cleaning and scrubbing going
on forever. <em>If I am ever not tired again</em>. Shifting her
position on the bed, she looked at her friends again. Elayne still
had her eyes on the list of names. Nynaeve&rsquo;s steps had slowed. <em>
Any moment now, Nynaeve will say it again. Any moment</em>.</p>

<p>Nynaeve came to a halt staring down at Elayne. &ldquo;Put
those away. We have been over them twenty times, and there isn&rsquo;t a
word that helps. Verin gave us rubbish. The question is, was it all
she had, or did she give us rubbish on purpose?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>As expected. Maybe half an hour till she says it
again</em>. Egwene frowned down at her hands, glad she could not
see them clearly. The Great Serpent ring looked&mdash;out of place&mdash;on hands all wrinkled from long immersion in hot, soapy
water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Knowing their names helps,&rdquo; Elayne said, still
reading. &ldquo;Knowing what they look like helps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know very well what I mean,&rdquo; Nynaeve
snapped.</p>

<p>Egwene sighed and folded her arms in front of her,
rested her chin on them. When she had come out of Sheriam&rsquo;s study
that morning, with the sun still not even a glint on the horizon,
Nynaeve had been waiting with a candle in the cold, dark hall. She
had not been seeing very clearly, but she was sure Nynaeve had
looked ready to chew stone. And knowing chewing stones would not
change anything in the next few minutes. That was why she was so
irritable. <em>She&rsquo;s as touchy about her pride as any man I ever
met. But she should not take it out on Elayne and me. Light, if
Elayne can stand it, she should be able to. She isn&rsquo;t the Wisdom
anymore</em>.</p>

<p>Elayne hardly appeared to notice whether Nynaeve was
irritable or not. She frowned into the distance thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Liandrin was the only Red. All the other Ajahs lost two each.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, do be quiet, child,&rdquo; Nynaeve said.</p>

<p>Elayne wiggled her left hand to display her Great
Serpent ring, gave Nynaeve a meaningful look, and went right on.
&ldquo;No two were born in the same city, and no more than two in any one
country. Amico Nagoyin was the youngest, only four years older than
Egwene and I. Joiya Byir could be our grandmother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene did not like it that one of the Black Ajah
shared her daughter&rsquo;s name. <em>Fool girl! People sometimes have
the same name, and you never had daughter. It wasn&rsquo;t real!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;And what does that tell us?&rdquo; Nynaeve&rsquo;s voice was too
calm; she was ready to explode like a wagon full of fireworks.
&ldquo;What secrets have you found in it that I missed? I am getting old
and blind, after all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It tells us it is all too neat,&rdquo; Elayne said calmly.
&ldquo;What chance that thirteen women chosen solely because they were
Darkfriends would be so neatly arrayed across age, across nations,
across Ajahs? Shouldn&rsquo;t there be perhaps three Reds, or four born
in Cairhien, or just two the same age, if it was all chance? They
had women to choose from or they could not have chosen so random a
pattern. There are still Black Ajah in the Tower, or elsewhere, we
don&rsquo;t know about. It must mean that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve gave her braid one ferocious tug. &ldquo;Light! I
think you may be right. You did find secrets I couldn&rsquo;t. Light, I
was hoping they all went with Liandrin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do not even know that she is their leader,&rdquo;
Elayne said. &ldquo;She could have been ordered to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to <em>
dispose</em> of us.&rdquo; Her mouth twisted. &ldquo;I am afraid I can only
think of one reason for them to go to such lengths to spread
everything out so, to avoid any pattern except a lack of pattern. I
think it means there is a pattern of some kind to the Black
Ajah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s a pattern,&rdquo; Nynaeve said firmly, &ldquo;we will
find it. Elayne, if watching your mother run her court taught you
to think like this, I&rsquo;m glad you watched closely.&rdquo; Elayne&rsquo;s
answering smile made a dimple in her cheek.</p>

<p>Egwene eyed the older woman carefully. It seemed
Nynaeve was finally ready to stop being a bear with a sore tooth.
She raised her head. &ldquo;Unless they want us to think they&rsquo;re hiding a
pattern, so we will waste our time hunting for it when there isn&rsquo;t
one. I am not saying there isn&rsquo;t; I am only saying we do not know
yet. Let&rsquo;s look for it, but I think we ought to look at other
things, too, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you finally decided to rouse,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. &ldquo;I
thought you had gone to sleep.&rdquo; But she was still smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is right,&rdquo; Elayne said disgustedly. &ldquo;I have
built a bridge out of straw. Worse than straw. Wishes. Maybe you
are right, too, Nynaeve. What use is this&mdash;this rubbish?&rdquo; She
snatched one paper out of the stack in front of her. &ldquo;Rianna has
black hair with a white streak above her left ear. If I am close
enough to see that, it&rsquo;s closer than I want to be.&rdquo; She grabbed
another page. &ldquo;Chesmal Emry is one of the most talented Healers
anyone has seen in years. Light, could you imagine being Healed by
one of the Black Ajah?&rdquo; A third sheet. &ldquo;Marillin Gemalphin is fond
of cats and goes out of her way to help injured animals. Cats!
Paah!&rdquo; She scrabbled all the pages together, crumpling them in her
fists. &ldquo;It is useless rubbish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve knelt beside her and gently pried her hands
from around the papers. &ldquo;Perhaps, and perhaps not.&rdquo; She smoothed
the pages carefully on her breast. &ldquo;You found in them something for
us to look for. Perhaps we will find more, if we are persistent.
And there is the other list.&rdquo; Both her eyes and Elayne&rsquo;s darted to
Egwene, brown and blue alike frowning worriedly.</p>

<p>Egwene avoided looking at the table where the other
sheets lay. She did not want to think about them, but she could not
avoid it. The list of <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> had etched itself into
her mind.</p>

<p>Item. A rod of clear crystal, smooth and perfectly
clear, one foot long and one inch in diameter. Use unknown. Last
study made by Corianin Nedeal. Item. A figurine of an unclothed
woman in alabaster, one hand tall. Use unknown. Last study made by
Corianin Nedeal. Item. A disc, apparently of simple iron yet
untouched by rust, three inches in diameter, finely engraved on
both sides with a tight spiral. Use unknown. Last study made by
Corianin Nedeal. Item. Too many items, and more than half the &ldquo;use
unknowns&rdquo; last studied by Corianin Nedeal. Thirteen of them, to be
exact.</p>

<p>Egwene shivered. <em>It&rsquo;s getting so I do not even
like to think of that number</em>.</p>

<p>The knowns on the list were fewer, not all of any
apparent real use, but hardly more comforting, as she saw it. A
wooden carving of a hedgehog, no bigger than the last joint of a
man&rsquo;s thumb. Such a simple thing, and surely harmless. Any woman
who tried to channel through it went to sleep. Half a day of
peaceful, dreamless sleep, but it was too close not to make her
skin crawl. Three more had to do with sleep in some way. It was
almost a relief to read of a fluted rod of black stone, a full pace
in length, that produced balefire, with the notation DANGEROUS AND
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTROL writ so strong in Verin&rsquo;s hand that it
tore the paper in two places. Egwene still had no idea what
balefire was, but though it surely sounded dangerous if anything
ever did, it just as surely had nothing to do Corianin Nedeal or
dreams.</p>

<p>Nynaeve carried the smoothed-out pages to the table
and set them down. She hesitated before spreading the others out
and running her finger down one page, then the next. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s one
Mat would enjoy,&rdquo; she said in a voice much too light and airy.
&ldquo;Item. A carved cluster of six spotted dice, joined at the corners,
less than two inches across. Use unknown, save that channeling
through it seems to suspend chance in some way, or twist it.&rdquo; She
began to read aloud. &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;Tossed coins presented the same face every
time, and in one test landed balanced on edge one hundred times in
a row. One thousand tosses of the dice produced five crowns one
thousand times.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; She gave a forced laugh. &ldquo;Mat would love
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene sighed and got to her feet, walked stiffly to
the fireplace. Elayne scrambled up, watching as silently as
Nynaeve. Pushing her sleeve as far up her arm as it would go,
Egwene reached carefully up the chimney. Her fingers touched wool
on the smoke shelf, and she pulled out a wadded, singed stocking
with a hard lump in the toe. She brushed a smear of soot from her
arm, then took the stocking to the table and shook it out. The
twisted ring of striped, flecked stone spun across the tabletop and
fell flat atop a page of the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> list. For a few
moments they just stared at it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Nynaeve said finally, &ldquo;Verin simply missed
the fact that so many of them were last studied by Corianin.&rdquo; She
did not sound as if she really believed it.</p>

<p>Elayne nodded, but doubtfully. &ldquo;I saw her walking in
the rain once, soaking wet, and took a cloak to her. She was so
wrapped up in whatever she was thinking, I do not believe she knew
it was raining until I put the cloak around her shoulders. She
could have missed it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Egwene said. &ldquo;If she did not, she had to
know I&rsquo;d notice as soon as I read the list. I do not know.
Sometimes I think Verin notices more than she lets on. I just do
not know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So there&rsquo;s Verin to suspect,&rdquo; Elayne sighed. &ldquo;If she
is Black Ajah, then they know exactly what we are doing. And
Alanna.&rdquo; She gave Egwene an uncertain, sidelong look.</p>

<p>Egwene had told them everything. Except what happened
inside the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> during her testing; she could not
bring herself to talk about that, any more than Nynaeve or Elayne
could tell of their testings. Everything that happened in the
testing chamber, what Sheriam had said about the terrible weakness
conferred by the ability to channel, every word Verin had said,
whether it seemed important or not. The one part they had had
trouble accepting was Alanna; Aes Sedai just did not do things like
that. No one in her right mind did anything like that, but Aes
Sedai least of all.</p>

<p>Egwene glowered at them, almost hearing them say it.
&ldquo;Aes Sedai are not supposed to lie, either, but Verin and the
Mother seem awfully close with what they tell us. They are not
supposed to be Black Ajah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like Alanna.&rdquo; Nynaeve tugged her braid, then
shrugged. &ldquo;Oh, very well. Perha&mdash;That is, she did behave
oddly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Egwene said, and Nynaeve gave her an
acknowledging nod as if she had heard no sarcasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In any case, the Amyrlin knows of it, and she can
keep an eye on Alanna far more easily than we can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about Elaida and Sheriam?&rdquo; Egwene asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never been able to like Elaida,&rdquo; Elayne said,
&ldquo;but I cannot truly believe she is Black Ajah. And Sheriam? It&rsquo;s
impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve snorted. &ldquo;It should be impossible for any of
them. When we do find them, there is nothing says they&rsquo;ll all be
women we do not like. But I don&rsquo;t mean to put suspicion&mdash;not
this kind of suspicion!&mdash;on any woman. We need more to go on
than that they might have seen something they shouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Egwene
nodded agreement as quickly as Elayne, and Nynaeve went on: &ldquo;We
will tell the Amyrlin that much, and put no more weight to it than
it deserves. If she ever looks in on us as she said she would. If
you are with us when she comes, Elayne, remember she does not know
about you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not likely to forget it,&rdquo; Elayne said
fervently. &ldquo;But we should have some other way to get word to her.
My mother would have planned it better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not if she could not trust her messengers,&rdquo; Nynaeve
said. &ldquo;We will wait. Unless you two think one of us should have a
talk with Verin? No one would think that remarkable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne hesitated, then gave her head a small shake.
Egwene was quicker and more vigorous with hers; slip of the mind or
not, Verin had left out too much to be trusted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; Nynaeve sounded more than satisfied. &ldquo;I am
just as pleased we cannot talk to the Amyrlin when we choose. This
way we make our own decisions, act when and as we decide, without
her directing our every step.&rdquo; Her hand ran down the pages listing
stolen <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> as if she were reading it again, then
closed on the striped stone ring. &ldquo;And the first decision concerns
this. It&rsquo;s the first thing we have seen that has any real
connection to Liandrin and the others.&rdquo; She frowned at the ring,
then took a deep breath. &ldquo;I am going to sleep with it tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene did not hesitate before taking the ring out of
Nynaeve&rsquo;s hand. She wanted to hesitate&mdash;she wanted to keep
her hands by her sides&mdash;but she did not, and she was pleased.
&ldquo;I am the one they say might be a Dreamer. I do not know whether
that gives me any advantage, but Verin said it&rsquo;s dangerous using
this. Whichever of us uses it, she needs any advantage she can
find.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve gripped her braid and opened her mouth as if
to protest. When she finally spoke, though, it was to say, &ldquo;Are you
sure, Egwene? We do not even know if you <em>are</em> a Dreamer,
and I can channel more strongly than you. I still think I&mdash;&rdquo;
Egwene cut her off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can channel more strongly if you are angry. Can
you be sure you&rsquo;ll be angry in a dream? Will you have time to
become angry before you need to channel? Light, we don&rsquo;t even know
that anyone can channel in a dream. If one of us has to do it&mdash;and you are right; it is the only connection we have&mdash;it should be me. Maybe I really am a Dreamer. Besides, Verin did
give it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve looked as if she wanted to argue, but at last
she gave a grudging nod. &ldquo;Very well. But Elayne and I will be
there. I do not know what we can do, but if anything goes wrong,
perhaps we can wake you up, or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;We will be there.&rdquo; Elayne
nodded, too.</p>

<p>Now that she had their agreement, Egwene felt a
queasiness in the pit of her stomach. <em>I talked them into it. I
wish I did not want them to talk me out of it</em>. She became
aware of a woman standing in the doorway, a woman in novice white,
with her hair in long braids.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did no one ever teach you to knock, Else?&rdquo; Nynaeve
said.</p>

<p>Egwene hid the stone ring inside her fist. She had
the strangest feeling that Else had been staring at it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a message for you,&rdquo; Else said calmly. Her
eyes studied the table, with all the papers scattered on it, then
the three women around it. &ldquo;From the Amyrlin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene exchanged wondering looks with Nynaeve and
Elayne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; Nynaeve demanded.</p>

<p>Else arched an eyebrow in amusement. &ldquo;The belongings
left behind by Liandrin and the others were put in the third
storeroom on the right from the main stairs in the second basement
under the library.&rdquo; She glanced at the papers on the table again
and left, neither hurrying nor moving slowly.</p>

<p>Egwene felt as if she could not breathe. <em>We&rsquo;re
afraid to trust anybody, and the Amyrlin decides to trust Else
Grinwell of all women?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;That fool girl cannot be trusted not to blab to
anyone who&rsquo;ll listen!&rdquo; Nynaeve started for the door.</p>

<p>Egwene grabbed up her skirts and darted past her at a
run. Her shoes skidded on the tiles of the gallery, but she caught
a glimpse of white vanishing down the nearest ramp and dashed after
it. <em>She must be running, too, to be so far ahead already. Why
is she running?</em> The flash of white was already disappearing
down another ramp. Egwene followed.</p>

<p>A woman turned to face her at the foot of the ramp,
and Egwene stopped in confusion. Whoever she was, this was
certainly not Else. All in silver and white silk, she sparked
feelings Egwene had never had before. She was taller, more
beautiful by far, and the look in her black eyes made Egwene feel
small, scrawny, and none too clean. <em>She can probably channel
more of the Power than I can, too. Light, she is probably smarter
than all three of us put together on top of it. It isn&rsquo;t fair for
one woman to</em>&mdash;Abruptly she realized the way her thoughts
were going. Her cheeks reddened, and she gave herself a shake. She
had never felt&mdash;less&mdash;than any other woman before, and
she was not about to start now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bold,&rdquo; the woman said. &ldquo;You are bold to go running
about so, alone, where so many murders have been done.&rdquo; She sounded
almost pleased.</p>

<p>Egwene drew herself up and straightened her dress
hurriedly, hoping the other woman would not notice, knowing she
did, wishing the woman had not seen her running like a child. <em>Stop
that!</em> &ldquo;Pardon, but I am looking for a novice who came this way, I
think. She has large, dark eyes and dark hair in braids. She&rsquo;s
plump, and pretty in a way. Did you see which way she went?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tall woman looked her up and down in an amused
way. Egwene could not be sure, but she thought the woman might have
glanced a moment at the clenched fist by her side, where she still
held the stone ring. &ldquo;I do not think you will catch up to her. I
saw her, and she was running quite fast. I suspect she is far away
from here by now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Egwene began, but she was given no
chance to ask which way Else had gone. Something that might have
been anger, or annoyance, flashed through those black eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have taken up enough time with you for now. I have
more important matters to see to. Leave me.&rdquo; She gestured back the
way Egwene had come.</p>

<p>So strong was the command in her voice that Egwene
turned and was three steps up the ramp before she realized what she
was doing. Bristling, she spun back. <em>Aes Sedai or no, I</em>&mdash;</p>

<p>The gallery was empty.</p>

<p>Frowning, she dismissed the nearest doors&mdash;no
one lived in those rooms, except possibly mice&mdash;and ran down
the ramp, peered both ways, followed the curve of the gallery with
her eyes all the way around. She even peered over the rail, down
into the small Garden of the Accepted, and studied the other
galleries, higher as well as lower. She saw two Accepted in their
banded dresses, one Faolain and the other a woman she knew by sight
if not name. But there was no woman in silver and white
anywhere.</p>
