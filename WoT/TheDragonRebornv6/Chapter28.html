<h4><em>A Way Out</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">C</span>lad
only in his breeches, Mat was just finishing a
snack after breakfast&mdash;some ham, three apples, bread, and
butter&mdash;when the door of his room opened, and Nynaeve,
Egwene, and Elayne filed in, all smiling at him brightly. He got up
for a shirt, then stubbornly sat down again. They could at least
have knocked. In any case, it was good to see their faces. At
first, it was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you do look better,&rdquo; Egwene said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As if you had had a month of good food and rest,&rdquo;
Elayne said.</p>

<p>Nynaeve pressed a hand to his forehead. He flinched
before he recalled that she had done much the same for at least
five years, back home. <em>She was just the Wisdom then</em>, he
thought. <em>She wasn&rsquo;t wearing that ring</em>.</p>

<p>She had noticed his flinch. She gave him a tight
smile. &ldquo;You look ready to be up and about, to me. Are you tired of
being cooped up, yet? You never could stand two days in a row
indoors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He eyed the last apple core reluctantly, then dropped
it back on the plate. Almost, he started to lick the juice off his
fingers, but they were all three looking at him. And still smiling.
He realized he was trying to decide which of them was prettiest,
and could not. Had they been anybody but who&mdash;and what&mdash;they were, he would have asked any and all of them to dance a jig
or a reel. He had danced with Egwene often enough, back home, and
even once with Nynaeve, but that seemed a long time ago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;One pretty woman means fun at the dance. Two
pretty women mean trouble in the house. Three pretty women mean run
for the hills.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; He gave Nynaeve an even tighter smile than her
own. &ldquo;My da used to say that. You&rsquo;re up to something, Nynaeve. You
are all smiling like cats staring at a finch caught in a thornbush,
and I think I am the finch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The smiles flickered and vanished. He noticed their
hands and wondered why they all looked as if they had been washing
dishes. The Daughter-Heir of Andor surely never washed a dish, and
he had as hard a time imagining Nynaeve at it, even knowing she had
done her own back in Emond&rsquo;s Field. They all three wore Great
Serpent rings, now. That was new. And not a particularly pleasant
surprise. <em>Light, it had to happen sometime. It&rsquo;s none of my
business, and that is all there is to it. None of my business. It
just isn&rsquo;t</em>.</p>

<p>Egwene shook her head, but it seemed as much for the
other two women as for him. &ldquo;I told you we should ask him straight
out. He&rsquo;s stubborn as any mule when he wants to be, and tricksome
as a cat. You are, Mat. You know it, so stop frowning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He put his grin back quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, Egwene,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. &ldquo;Mat, just because we
want to ask you a favor does not mean we don&rsquo;t care how you feel.
We do care, and you know that, unless you&rsquo;re being even more
wool-headed than usual. Are you well? You look remarkably well
compared to how I last saw you. It really does look more like a
month than two days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to run ten miles and dance a jig at the
end of it.&rdquo; His stomach growled, reminding him how long it was to
midday yet, but he ignored it, and hoped they had not noticed. He
almost did feel as if he had had a month of rest and food. And had
had one meal in the last day. &ldquo;What favor?&rdquo; he asked suspiciously.
Nynaeve did not ask favors, in his recollection; Nynaeve told
people what to do and expected to see it done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you to carry a letter for me,&rdquo; Elayne said
before Nynaeve could speak. &ldquo;To my mother, in Caemlyn.&rdquo; She smiled,
making a dimple in her cheek. &ldquo;I would appreciate it so very much,
Mat.&rdquo; The morning light through the windows seemed to pick out
highlights in her hair.</p>

<p><em>I wonder if she likes to dance</em>. He pushed
the thought right out of his head. &ldquo;That does not sound too very
hard, but it&rsquo;s a long trip. What do I get out of it?&rdquo; From the look
on her face, he did not think that dimple had failed her very
often.</p>

<p>She drew herself up, slim and proud. He could almost
see a throne behind her. &ldquo;Are you a loyal subject of Andor? Do you
not wish to serve the Lion Throne, and your Daughter-Heir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat snickered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you that would not work either,&rdquo; Egwene said.
&ldquo;Not with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne had a wry twist to her mouth. &ldquo;I thought it
worth a try. It always works on the Guards, in Caemlyn. You said if
I smiled&mdash;&rdquo; She cut off short, very obviously not looking at
him.</p>

<p><em>What did you say, Egwene</em>, he thought,
furious. <em>That I&rsquo;m a fool for any girl who smiles at me?</em> He
kept his outward calm, though, and managed to maintain his
grin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish asking were enough,&rdquo; Egwene said, &ldquo;but you do
not do favors, do you, Mat? Have you ever done anything without
being coaxed, wheedled, or bullied?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He only smiled at her. &ldquo;I will dance with both of
you, Egwene, but I won&rsquo;t run errands.&rdquo; For an instant he thought
she was going to stick out her tongue at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we can go back to what we planned in the first
place,&rdquo; Nynaeve said in a too-calm voice. The other two nodded, and
she turned her attentions on him. For the first time since coming
in, she looked like the Wisdom of old, with a stare that could pin
you in your tracks and her braid ready to lash like a cat&rsquo;s
tail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are even ruder than I remembered, Matrim
Cauthon. With you sick so long&mdash;and Egwene, and Elayne, and I
taking care of you like a babe in swaddling&mdash;I had almost
forgotten. Even so, I would think you&rsquo;d have a little gratitude in
you. You&rsquo;ve talked about seeing the world, seeing great cities.
Well, what better city than Caemlyn? Do what you want, show your
gratitude, and help someone all at the same time.&rdquo; She produced a
folded parchment from inside her cloak and set it on the table. It
was sealed with a lily, in golden yellow wax. &ldquo;You cannot ask for
more than that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He eyed the paper regretfully. He barely remembered
passing through Caemlyn, once, with Rand. It was a shame to stop
them now, but he thought it best. <em>If you want the fun of the
jig, you have to pay the harper sooner or later</em>. And the way
Nynaeve was now, the longer he kept from paying, the worse it would
be. &ldquo;Nynaeve, I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, you cannot? Are you a fly on the
wall, or a man? A chance to do a favor for the Daughter-Heir of
Andor, to see Caemlyn, to meet Queen Morgase herself in all
probability, and you cannot? I really do not know what more you
could possibly want. Don&rsquo;t you skitter away like grease on a
griddle this time, Matrim Cauthon! Or has your heart changed so you
like seeing these all around you?&rdquo; She waved her left hand in his
face, practically hitting him in the nose with her ring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, Mat?&rdquo; Elayne said, and Egwene was staring at
him as if he had grown horns like a Trolloc.</p>

<p>He squirmed on his chair. &ldquo;It is not that I don&rsquo;t
want to. I cannot! The Amyrlin&rsquo;s made it so I can&rsquo;t get off the
bloo&mdash;the island. Change that, and I will carry your letter
in my teeth, Elayne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Looks passed between them. He sometimes wondered if
women could read each other&rsquo;s minds. They certainly seemed to read
his when he least wanted it. But this time, whatever they had
decided silently among themselves, they had not read his
thoughts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Explain,&rdquo; Nynaeve said curtly. &ldquo;Why would the
Amyrlin want to keep you here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shrugged, and looked her straight in the eye, and
gave her his best rueful grin. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because I was sick. Because it
went on so long. She said she would not let me go until she was
sure I wouldn&rsquo;t go off somewhere and die. Not that I&rsquo;m going to, of
course. Die, I mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve frowned, and jerked her braid, and suddenly
took his head between her hands; a chill ran through him. <em>
Light, the Power!</em> Before the thought was done, she had
released him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? What did you do to me, Nynaeve?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a tenth part of what you deserve, in all
likelihood,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You are as healthy as a bull. Weaker than
you look, but healthy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you I was,&rdquo; he said uneasily. He tried to get
his grin back. &ldquo;Nynaeve, she looked like you. The Amyrlin, I mean.
Managing to loom even if she is a foot too short for it, and
bullying&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; The way her eyebrows climbed, he decided that was
not a road to go down any further. As long as he kept them away
from the Horn. He wondered if they knew. &ldquo;Well. Anyway, I think
they want to keep me here because of that dagger. I mean, until
they figure out exactly how it did what it did. You know how Aes
Sedai are.&rdquo; He gave a small laugh. They all just looked at him.
<em>Maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t have said that. Burn me! They want to be
bloody Aes Sedai. Burn me, I&rsquo;m going on too long. I wish Nynaeve
would stop staring at me like that. Keep it short</em>. &ldquo;The
Amyrlin made it so I cannot cross a bridge or board a ship without
an order from her. You see? It&rsquo;s not that I do not want to help. I
just can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you will if we can get you out of Tar Valon?&rdquo;
Nynaeve said intently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You get me out of Tar Valon, and I&rsquo;ll carry Elayne
to her mother on my back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s eyebrows went up, this time, and Egwene
shook her head, mouthing his name with a sharp look in her eyes.
Women had no sense of humor, sometimes.</p>

<p>Nynaeve motioned the two of them to follow her to the
windows, where they turned their backs to him and talked so softly
he could catch only a murmur. He thought he heard Egwene say
something about only needing one if they stayed together. Watching,
he wondered if they really thought they could get around the
Amyrlin&rsquo;s order. <em>If they can do that, I will carry their bloody
letter. I really will carry it in my teeth</em>.</p>

<p>Without thinking, he picked up an apple core and bit
off the end. One chew, and he hastily spit the mouthful of bitter
seeds back onto the plate.</p>

<p>When they came back to the table, Egwene handed him a
thick, folded paper. He eyed them suspiciously before opening it
out. As he read, he began humming to himself without knowing
it.</p>

<p class="note">What the bearer does is done at my order and by
my authority. Obey, and keep silent, at my command.</p>

<p class="note_sig">Siuan Sanche<br>
Watcher of the Seals<br>
 Flame of Tar Valon<br>
The Amyrlin Seat</p>

<p>And sealed at the bottom with the Flame of Tar Valon
in a circle of white wax as hard as stone.</p>

<p>He realized he was humming &ldquo;A Pocket Full of Gold&rdquo;
and stopped. &ldquo;Is this real? You didn&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? How did you get
this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She did not forge it, if that is what you mean,&rdquo;
Elayne said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never you mind how we got it,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. &ldquo;It is
real. That is all that need concern you. I would not show it
around, were I you, or the Amyrlin will take it back, but it will
get you past the guards and onto a ship. You said you&rsquo;d take the
letter, if we did that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can consider it in Morgase&rsquo;s hands right now.&rdquo;
He did not want to stop reading the paper, but he folded it back up
anyway, and laid it on top of Elayne&rsquo;s letter. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t happen
to have a little coin to go with this, would you? Some silver? A
gold mark or two? I have almost enough for my passage, but I hear
things are growing expensive downriver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve shook her head. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have money? You
gambled with Hurin almost every night until you grew too sick to
hold the dice. Why should things be more expensive downriver?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We gambled for coppers, Nynaeve, and he would not
even do that after a while. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. I will manage. Don&rsquo;t
you listen to what people say? There&rsquo;s civil war in Cairhien, and I
hear it is bad in Tear, too. I&rsquo;ve heard a room at an inn in
Aringill costs more than a good horse back home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have been busy,&rdquo; she said sharply, and exchanged
worried looks with Egwene and Elayne that set him wondering
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. I can make out.&rdquo; There had to be
gaming in the inns near the docks. A night with the dice would put
him aboard a ship in the morning with a full purse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just you deliver that letter to Queen Morgase, Mat,&rdquo;
Nynaeve said. &ldquo;And do not let anyone know you have it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it to her. I said I would, didn&rsquo;t I? You
would think I didn&rsquo;t keep my promises.&rdquo; The looks he got from
Nynaeve and Egwene reminded him of a few he had not kept. &ldquo;I will
do it. Blood and&mdash;I will do it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They stayed awhile longer, talking of home for the
most part. Egwene and Elayne sat on the bed, and Nynaeve took the
armchair, while he kept his stool. Talk of Emond&rsquo;s Field made him
homesick, and it seemed to make Nynaeve and Egwene sad, as if they
were speaking of something they would never see again. He was sure
their eyes moistened, but when he tried to change the subject, they
brought it back again, to people they knew, to the festivals of Bel
Tine and Sunday, to harvest dances and picnic gatherings for the
shearing.</p>

<p>Elayne talked to him of Caemlyn, of what to expect at
the Royal Palace and who to speak to, and a little of the city.
Sometimes she held herself in a way that made him all but see a
crown on her head. A man would have to be a fool to let himself get
involved with a woman like her. When they rose to leave, he was
sorry to see them go.</p>

<p>He stood, suddenly feeling awkward. &ldquo;Look, you have
done me a favor here.&rdquo; He touched the Amyrlin&rsquo;s paper, on the
table. &ldquo;A big favor. I know you&rsquo;re all going to be Aes Sedai&rdquo;&mdash;he stumbled a little on that&mdash;&ldquo;and you will be a queen one
day, Elayne, but if you ever need help, if there is ever anything I
can do, I will come. You can count on it. Did I say something
funny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne had a hand over her mouth, and Egwene was
struggling openly with a laugh. &ldquo;No, Mat,&rdquo; Nynaeve said smoothly,
but her lips twitched. &ldquo;Just something I have observed about
men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would have to be a woman to understand,&rdquo; Elayne
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Journey well and safely, Mat,&rdquo; Egwene said. &ldquo;And
remember, if a woman does need a hero, she needs him today, not
tomorrow.&rdquo; The laughter bubbled out of her.</p>

<p>He stared at the door closing behind them. Women, he
decided for at least the hundredth time, were odd.</p>

<p>Then his eye fell on Elayne&rsquo;s letter, and the folded
paper lying atop it. The Amyrlin&rsquo;s blessed, not-to-be-understood,
but welcome-as-a-fire-in-winter paper. He danced a little caper in
the middle of the flowered carpet. Caemlyn to see, and a queen to
meet. <em>Your own words will free me of you, Amyrlin. And get me
away from Selene, too</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never catch me,&rdquo; he laughed, and meant it for
both of them. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never catch Mat Cauthon.&rdquo;</p>
