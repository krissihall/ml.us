<h4><em>A Hero in the Night</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">L</span>eaning
on the rail, Mat watched the walled town of
Aringill come closer as the sweeps worked the <em>Gray Gull</em> in
toward the long, tarred-timber docks. Protected by high stone
wing-walls that thrust out into the river, those docks swarmed with
people, and more were leaving the ships of various sizes that lay
tied all along them. Some of the people pushed barrows, or pulled
sledges or tall-wheeled carts, all piled high with furniture and
chests lashed in place, but most carried bundles on their backs, if
that. Not everyone bustled. Many men and women huddled together
uncertainly, and children clung crying to their legs. Soldiers in
red coats and shiny breastplates kept trying to make them move off
the docks into the town, but most seemed too frightened to
move.</p>

<p>Mat turned and shaded his eyes to peer at the river
they were leaving. The Erinin was busier here than he had seen it
south of Tar Valon, with nearly a dozen vessels under way in sight,
ranging from a long, sharp-prowed splinter darting upriver against
the current, pushed by two triangular sails, to a wide,
bluff-bowed ship with square sails, still wallowing along well to
the north.</p>

<p>Nearly half the ships he could see had nothing to do
with the river trade, though. Two broad-beamed craft with empty
decks were lumbering across the river, toward a smaller town on the
far bank, while three others labored back toward Aringill, their
decks packed with people like barrels of fish. The setting sun,
still its own height above the horizon, shadowed a banner flying
over that other town. That shore was Cairhien, but he did not need
to see the banner to know it was the White Lion of Andor. There had
been talk enough in the few Andoran villages where the <em>Gray
Gull</em> had stopped briefly.</p>

<p>He shook his head. Politics did not interest him.
<em>As long as they don&rsquo;t try telling me again I&rsquo;m an Andorman just
because of some map. Burn me, they might even try to make me fight
in their bloody army, if this Cairhien business spreads. Following
orders. Light!</em> With a shiver, he turned back to Aringill.
Barefoot men on the <em>Gray Gull</em> were readying ropes to toss
to others on the docks.</p>

<p>Captain Mallia was eyeing him from back by the
tiller. The fellow had never given up his efforts to ingratiate
himself with them, his attempts to learn what their important
mission was. Mat had finally shown him the sealed letter and told
him that he was carrying it from the Daughter-Heir to the Queen. A
personal message from a daughter to her mother; no more. Mallia had
only seemed to hear the words &ldquo;Queen Morgase.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat grinned to himself. A deep coat pocket held two
purses fatter than when he had boarded the vessel; he had enough
loose coin to more than fill another two. His luck had not been
quite so good as on that first, strange night when the dice and
everything else had seemed to go crazy, but still it was good
enough. After the third night, Mallia had given up trying to show
his friendliness by gambling, but his money chest was already
lighter by then. It would be lighter still after Aringill. Mallia
had need to restock his food&mdash;Mat glanced at the people
milling on the docks&mdash;if he could, here, at any price.</p>

<p>The grin faded as his thoughts went back to the
letter. A little work with a hot knife blade, and the golden lily
seal had been lifted. He had found nothing: Elayne was studying
hard and making progress and eager to learn. She was a dutiful
daughter, and the Amyrlin Seat had punished her for running away
and told her never to speak of it again, so her mother would
understand why she could not say more. She said she had been raised
to the Accepted, and was that not wonderful, so soon, and she was
being trusted with greater duties now, and would have to leave Tar
Valon for just a short time on the service of the Amyrlin herself.
Her mother was not to worry.</p>

<p>It was all very well for her to tell Morgase not to
worry. It was him she had landed in the soup kettle. This silly
letter had to be the reason those men had come after him, but even
Thom had been able to make nothing of it, though he muttered about
&ldquo;ciphers&rdquo; and &ldquo;codes&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Game of Houses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat had the letter safe in the lining of his coat,
now, its seal replaced, and he was willing to bet no one would ever
know. If someone wanted it badly enough to kill him for it, they
might try again. <em>I told you I&rsquo;d deliver it, Nynaeve, and I
bloody will, no matter who tries to stop me</em>. Even so, he would
have words to say the next time he saw those three irritating women&mdash;<em>If I ever do. Light, I never thought of that</em>&mdash;words he did not think they would enjoy hearing.</p>

<p>As the crewmen hurled their lines onto the dock, Thom
came on deck, his instrument cases on his back and his bundle in
one hand. Even with a limp he strutted to the rail, giving the tail
of his cloak little flourishes to make the colored patches flutter,
and blowing out his long, white mustaches importantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody is watching, Thom,&rdquo; Mat said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
they would even see a gleeman unless he had food in his hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom stared at the docks. &ldquo;Light! I had heard it was
bad, but I did not expect this! Poor fools. Half of them look as if
they are starving. It may cost us one of your purses for a room
tonight. And the other for a meal, if you intend to keep on the way
you&rsquo;ve been going. Nearly made me ill to watch you. You try eating
that way where those people down there can see you, and you may
have your brains battered out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat only smiled at him.</p>

<p>Mallia came stumping down the deck, tugging the point
of his beard, as the <em>Gray Gull</em> was warped into her berth.
Crewmen ran to set a gangplank, and Sanor stood guard on it, heavy
arms folded across his chest, in case the throng on the docks tried
to board. None of them did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you will be leaving me here,&rdquo; Mallia told Mat.
The captain&rsquo;s smile was not as ready as it might have been. &ldquo;Are
you certain there is nothing I can do to help further? Burn my
soul, I never saw such a rabble! Those soldiers ought to clear the
docks&mdash;with the sword, if need be!&mdash;so decent traders
can do business. Perhaps Sanor can make a path through this scum to
your inn for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>So you&rsquo;ll know where we are staying? Not bloody
likely</em>. &ldquo;I had thought of eating before I went ashore, and
maybe a game of dice to pass the time.&rdquo; Mallia&rsquo;s face went white.
&ldquo;But I think I would like a steady floor under me for my next meal.
So we will leave you now, Captain. It has been an enjoyable
voyage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While relief still battled consternation on the
captain&rsquo;s face, Mat picked up his things from the deck and, using
the quarterstaff as a walking stick, made his way to the gangplank
with Thom. Mallia followed as far as the head of the plank,
murmuring regrets at their departure that jumped from real to
insincere and back again. Mat was certain the man hated losing a
chance to ingratiate himself with his High Lord Samon by learning
details of a pact between Andor and Tar Valon.</p>

<p>As Mat and the gleeman pushed through the crowds,
Thom muttered, &ldquo;I know the man is far from likable, but why do you
have to keep taunting him? Wasn&rsquo;t it enough that you ate every
scrap of what he thought would feed him all the way to Tear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not been eating it all for nearly two days.&rdquo;
The hunger had simply been gone one morning, to his great relief.
It had been as if Tar Valon had loosed its last hold on him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been throwing most of it over the side, and a hard job it was
making sure nobody saw.&rdquo; Among these drawn faces, many of them
children&rsquo;s, it did not seem so funny anymore. &ldquo;Mallia deserved
taunting. What about that ship, yesterday? The one that was stuck
on a mudbank or something. He could have stopped to help, but he
would not go near it however much they shouted.&rdquo; There was a woman
with long, dark hair ahead who might have been pretty if she had
not looked so bone weary, peering into the face of every man who
passed her as if looking for someone; a boy little taller than her
waist and two girls shorter clung to her, all crying. &ldquo;All that
talk about river brigands and traps. It didn&rsquo;t look like any trap
to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom dodged around a high-wheeled cart&mdash;a cage
holding two squealing pigs was lashed atop the canvas-covered mound&mdash;and nearly tripped over a sledge being pulled by a man and a
woman.&rdquo;And you go out of your way to help people, do you? Strange
how that has escaped my eye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help anyone who can pay,&rdquo; Mat said firmly.
&ldquo;Only fools in stories do something for nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two girls sobbed into their mother&rsquo;s skirts while
the boy fought his tears. The woman&rsquo;s deep-set eyes rested on Mat
for a moment, studying his face, before drifting on; they looked as
if she wished she could weep, too. On impulse he dug a fistful of
loose coins out of his pocket without looking to see what they were
and pressed them into her hand. She gave a start of surprise,
stared at the gold and silver in her hand with incomprehension that
quickly turned to a smile, and opened her mouth, tears of gratitude
filling her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Buy them something to eat,&rdquo; he said quickly, and
hurried on before she could speak. He noticed Thom looking at him.
&ldquo;What are you gawking at? Coin comes easily as long as I can find
somebody who likes to dice.&rdquo; Thom nodded slowly, but Mat was not
sure he had gotten his point across. <em>Bloody children&rsquo;s crying
was getting on my nerves, that&rsquo;s all. Fool gleeman will probably
expect me to give gold away to every waif that comes along, now.
Fool!</em> For an uncomfortable moment, he was not certain whether
the last had been meant for Thom or himself.</p>

<p>Taking himself in hand, he avoided looking at any
face long enough to really see it until he found the one he wanted,
at the foot of the dock. The helmetless soldier in red coat and
breastplate, urging people into the town, had the grizzled look of
a squadman, an experienced leader of ten or so. Squinting into the
setting sun, he reminded Mat of Uno, though he had both his eyes.
He looked almost as tired as the people he was chivying. &ldquo;Move
along,&rdquo; he was shouting in a hoarse voice. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t bloody stay
here. Move along. Into the town with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat stationed himself squarely in front of the
soldier and put on a smile. &ldquo;Your pardon, Captain, but can you tell
me where I might find a decent inn? And a stable with good horses
to sell. We have a long way to go, come morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The soldier eyed him up and down, examined Thom and
his gleeman&rsquo;s cloak, then shifted back to Mat. &ldquo;Captain, is it?
Well, boy, you&rsquo;ll have the Dark One&rsquo;s own luck if you find a stable
to sleep in. Most of this lot are sleeping under hedges. And if you
find a horse that hasn&rsquo;t been slaughtered for cooking, you&rsquo;ll
likely have to fight the man who owns it to make him sell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eating horse!&rdquo; Thom muttered disgustedly. &ldquo;Has it
really become that bad on this side of the river? Isn&rsquo;t the Queen
sending food?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is bad, gleeman.&rdquo; The soldier looked as if he
wanted to spit. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re crossing over faster than the mills can
grind flour, or wagons carry foodstuffs from the farms. Well, it
will not last much longer. The order has come down. Tomorrow, we
stop letting anyone across, and if they try, we send them back.&rdquo;
He scowled at the people milling on the dock as if it were all
their fault, then brought the same hard look to bear on Mat. &ldquo;You
are taking up space, traveler. Move along.&rdquo; His voice rose to a
shout again, directed at everyone within hearing. &ldquo;Move along! You
cannot bloody stay here! Move along!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat and Thom joined the thin stream of people, carts,
and sledges flowing toward the gates in the town wall, and into
Aringill.</p>

<p>The main streets were paved with flat gray stones,
but they were crowded with so many people that it was difficult to
see the stones under your own boots. Most appeared to be moving
aimlessly, with nowhere to go, and those who had given up squatted
dejectedly along the sides of the street, the lucky ones with
bundled belongings in front of them or some cherished possession
clutched in their arms. Mat saw three men holding clocks, and a
dozen or more with silver goblets or platters. The women held
children to their breasts, mainly. A babble filled the air, a low,
wordless hum of worry. He pushed through the crowd with a frown on
his face, searching for the sign that would mark an inn. The
buildings were every sort, wood and brick and stone all cheek by
jowl, with roofs of tile, or slate, or thatch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does not sound like Morgase,&rdquo; Thom said after a
time, half to himself. His bushy eyebrows were pulled down like a
white arrow pointing to his nose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does not sound like her?&rdquo; Mat asked
absently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stopping the crossings. Sending people back. She
always had a temper like lightning, but she always had a soft
heart, too, for anyone poor or hungry.&rdquo; He shook his head.</p>

<p>Mat saw a sign, then&mdash;the Riverman, it said,
and showed a barefoot, shirtless fellow doing a jig&mdash;and
turned that way, forcing an angle across the flow with the
quarterstaff. &ldquo;Well, it had to be her. Who else could it be? Forget
Morgase, Thom. We&rsquo;ve a long way to Caemlyn, yet. First let us see
how much gold it takes to buy a bed for the night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The common room of The Riverman looked as crowded as
the street outside, and when the innkeeper heard what Mat wanted,
he laughed till his chins shook. &ldquo;I am sleeping four to a bed, now.
If my own mother came to me, I could not give her a blanket by the
fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you must have noticed,&rdquo; Thom said, his voice
taking on that echoing quality, &ldquo;I am a gleeman. Surely you can
find at least pallets in a corner in return for me entertaining
your patrons with stories and juggling, eating of fire, and sleight
of hand.&rdquo; The innkeeper laughed in his face.</p>

<p>As Mat pulled him back into the street, Thom growled
in his normal voice, &ldquo;You never gave me a chance to ask after his
stable. Surely I could have gotten us a place in the hayloft, at
least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have slept in enough stables and barns since
leaving Emond&rsquo;s Field,&rdquo; Mat told him, &ldquo;and under enough bushes,
too. I want a bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But at the next four inns he found, the innkeeper
gave him the same answer as the first; the last two almost threw
him out bodily when he offered to dice for a bed. And when the
owner of the fifth told him he could not give a pallet to the Queen
herself&mdash;this at a place called The Good Queen&mdash;he
sighed and asked, &ldquo;What about your stable, then? Surely we can bed
down in the hayloft for a price.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My stable is for horses,&rdquo; the round-faced man said,
&ldquo;not that many are left in the city.&rdquo; He had been polishing a
silver cup; now he opened one door of a shallow cupboard standing
on top of a deep, drawered chest and placed it inside with others;
none of them matched. A tooled-leather dice cup sat atop the chest,
just beyond the arc of the cupboard&rsquo;s doors. &ldquo;I do not put people
in there to frighten the horses, and perhaps make off with them.
Those who pay me for stabling their animals want them well tended,
and I&rsquo;ve two of my own in there, besides. There are no beds in my
stable for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat eyed the dice cup thoughtfully. He pulled a gold
Andoran crown out of his pocket and set it atop the chest. The next
coin was a silver Tar Valon mark, then a gold one, and a gold
Tairen crown. The innkeeper looked at the coins and licked his
plump lips. Mat added two silver Illianer marks and another gold
Andoran crown, and looked at the round-faced man. The innkeeper
hesitated. Mat reached for the coins. The innkeeper&rsquo;s hand reached
them first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps just the two of you would not disturb the
horses too greatly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat smiled at him. &ldquo;Speaking of horses, what price
for those two of yours? With saddles and bridles, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not sell my horses,&rdquo; the man said, clutching
the coins to his chest.</p>

<p>Mat picked up the dice cup and rattled it. &ldquo;Twice as
much again against the horses, saddles, and bridles.&rdquo; He shook his
coat pocket to make the loose coins rattle, too, to show he had
more to cover the wager. &ldquo;My one toss against the best of your
two.&rdquo; He almost laughed as greed lit the innkeeper&rsquo;s entire
face.</p>

<p>When Mat walked into the stable, the first thing he
did was check along the half-dozen stalls with horses in them for a
pair of brown geldings. They were nondescript animals, but they
were his. They needed currying badly, but otherwise they seemed in
good condition, especially considering that all the stablemen but
one had run off. The innkeeper had been extremely disparaging of
their complaints that they could no longer live on what he paid
them, and he seemed to think it a crime that the one man who
remained had actually had the audacity to say he was going home to
bed just because he was tired from doing three men&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five sixes,&rdquo; Thom muttered behind him. The looks he
cast around the stable did not seem as enthralled as they might,
seeing that he had suggested it in the first place. Dust motes
shone in the last light of the setting sun coming through the big
doors, and the ropes used to hoist hay bales hung like vines from
pulleys in the roof beams. The hayloft was dim in the gloom above;
&ldquo;When he threw four sixes and a five on his second toss, he thought
you&rsquo;d lost for sure, and so did I. You have not been winning every
toss of late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I win enough.&rdquo; Mat was just as relieved not to be
winning every throw. Luck was one thing, but remembering that night
still sent shivers down his back. Still, for one moment as he shook
that dice cup, he had all but known what the pips would be. As he
tossed the quarterstaff up into the loft, thunder crashed in the
sky. He scrambled up the ladder, calling back to Thom. &ldquo;This was a
good idea. I&rsquo;d think you would be happy to be in out of the rain
tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Most of the hay was in bales stacked against the
outer walls, but there was more than enough loose for him to make a
bed with his cloak over it. Thom appeared at the top of the ladder
as he was pulling two loaves of bread and a wedge of green-veined
cheese from his leather script. The innkeeper&mdash;his name was
Jeral Florry&mdash;had parted with the food for merely enough coin
to have bought one of those horses in more peaceful days. They ate
while rain began drumming on the roof, washing the food down with
water from their waterbottles&mdash;Florry had had no wine at any
price&mdash;and when they were done, Thom dug out his tinderbox
and thumbed his long-stemmed pipe full of tabac and settled back
for a smoke.</p>

<p>Mat was lying on his back, staring at the shadowed
roof and wondering if the rain would break before morning&mdash;he
wanted that letter out of his hands as quickly as possible&mdash;when he heard an axle creak into the stable. Rolling to the edge of
the loft, he peered down. There was enough dusk left for him to
see.</p>

<p>A slender woman was straightening from the shafts of
the high-wheeled cart she had just dragged in out of the rain,
pulling off her cloak and muttering to herself as she shook the wet
from it. Her hair was plaited in a multitude of small braids, and
her silk dress&mdash;he thought it was a pale green&mdash;was
elaborately embroidered across her breasts. The dress had been
fine, once, but now it was tattered and stained. She knuckled her
back, still talking to herself in a low voice, and hurried to the
stable doors to peer out into the rain. Just as hurriedly, she
ducked out to pull the big doors shut, enclosing the stable in
darkness. There was a rustling below, a clink and a slosh, and
suddenly a small flare of light bloomed into a lantern in her
hands. She looked around, found a hook on a stall post, hung the
lantern, and went to dig under the roped canvas covering her
cart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She did that quickly,&rdquo; Thom said softly around his
pipe. &ldquo;She could have set fire to the stable striking flint and
steel in the dark like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman came out with the end of a loaf of bread,
which she gnawed as if it were hard and her hunger did not
care.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there any of that cheese left?&rdquo; Mat whispered.
Thom shook his head.</p>

<p>The woman began sniffing at the air, and Mat realized
she probably smelled Thom&rsquo;s tabac smoke. He was about to stand and
announce their presence when one of the stable doors opened
again.</p>

<p>The woman crouched, ready to run, as four men walked
in out of the rain, doffing their wet cloaks to reveal pale coats
with wide sleeves and embroidery across the chest, and baggy
breeches embroidered down the legs. Their clothes might be fancy,
but they were all big men, and their faces were grim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, Aludra,&rdquo; a man in a yellow coat said, &ldquo;you did
not run so fast as you thought to, eh?&rdquo; He had a strange accent, to
Mat&rsquo;s ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tammuz,&rdquo; the woman said as if it were a curse. &ldquo;It
is not enough that you cause me to be cast out of the Guild with
your blundering, you great ox-brain you, but now you chase after me
as well.&rdquo; She had the same odd way of speaking as the man. &ldquo;Do you
think that I am glad to see you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The one called Tammuz laughed. &ldquo;You are a very large
fool, Aludra, which I always knew. Had you merely gone away, you
could have lived a long life in some quiet place. But you could not
forget the secrets in your head, eh? Did you believe we would not
hear that you try to earn your way making what it is the right of
the Guild alone to make?&rdquo; Suddenly there was a knife in his hand.
&ldquo;It will be a great pleasure to cut your throat, Aludra.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat was not even aware that he had stood up until one
of the doubled ropes dangling from the ceiling was in his hands and
he had launched himself out of the loft. <em>Burn me for a bloody
fool!</em></p>

<p>He only had time for that one frantic thought, and
then he was plowing through the cloaked men, sending them toppling
like pins in a game of bowls. The ropes slipped through his hands,
and he fell, tumbling across the straw-covered floor himself, coins
spilling from his pockets, to end up against a stall. When he
scrambled to his feet, the four men were already rising, too. And
they all had knives in their hands, now. <em>Light-blind fool! Burn
me! Burn me!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked up, and Thom tossed his quarterstaff down
to him. He snagged it out of the air just in time to knock the
blade out of Tammuz&rsquo;s fist and thump him a sharp crack on the side
of the head. The man crumpled, but the other three were right
behind, and for a hectic moment Mat had all he could do with a
whirling staff to keep knife blades away from him, rapping knees
and ankles and ribs until he could land a good blow on a head. When
the last man fell, he stared at them a moment, then raised his
glare to the woman. &ldquo;Did you have to choose this stable to be
murdered in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She slipped a slim-bladed dagger back into a sheath
at her belt. &ldquo;I would have helped you, but I feared that you might
mistake me for one of these great buffoons if I came near with
steel in my hand. And I chose this stable because the rain is wet
and so am I, and no one was watching this place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was older than he had thought, at least ten or
fifteen years older than he, but pretty still, with large, dark
eyes and a small, full mouth that seemed on the point of a pout.
<em>Or getting ready for a kiss</em>. He gave a small laugh and
leaned on his staff. &ldquo;Well, what is done is done. I suppose you
were not trying to bring us trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom was climbing down from the loft, awkwardly
because of his leg, and Aludra looked from him to Mat. The gleeman
had put his cloak back on; he seldom let anyone see him without it,
especially for the first time. &ldquo;This is like a story,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
am rescued by a gleeman and a young hero&rdquo;&mdash;she frowned at the
men sprawled on the stable floor&mdash;&ldquo;from these whose mothers
were pigs!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did they want to kill you?&rdquo; Mat asked. &ldquo;He said
something about secrets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The secrets,&rdquo; Thom said in very nearly his
performing voice, &ldquo;of making fireworks, unless I miss my guess. You
are an Illuminator, are you not?&rdquo; He made a courtly bow with an
elaborate swirl of his cloak. &ldquo;I am Thom Merrilin, a gleeman, as
you have seen.&rdquo; Almost as an afterthought, he added, &ldquo;And this is
Mat, a young man with a knack for finding trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was an Illuminator,&rdquo; Aludra said stiffly, &ldquo;but
this great pig Tammuz, he ruined a performance for the King of
Cairhien, and nearly he destroyed the chapter house, too. But me, I
was Mistress of the Chapter House, so it was me that the Guild held
responsible.&rdquo; Her voice became defensive. &ldquo;I do not tell the
secrets of the Guild, no matter what that Tammuz says, but I will
not let myself starve while I can make fireworks. I am no more in
the Guild, so the laws of the Guild, they do not apply to me
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Galldrian,&rdquo; Thom said, sounding almost as wooden as
she had. &ldquo;Well, he is a dead king now, and he&rsquo;ll see no more
fireworks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Guild,&rdquo; she said, sounding tired, &ldquo;they all but
blame me for this war in Cairhien, as if that one night of
disaster, it made Galldrian die.&rdquo; Thom grimaced. &ldquo;It seems I can no
longer remain here,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;Tammuz and these other oxen,
they will wake soon. Perhaps this time they will tell the soldiers
that I stole what I have made.&rdquo; She eyed Thom and then Mat,
frowning in thought, and seemed to reach a decision. &ldquo;I must reward
you, but I have no money. However, I have something that is perhaps
as good as gold. Maybe better. We shall see what you think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat exchanged glances with Thom as she went to root
under the canvas covering her cart. <em>I&rsquo;ll help anyone who can
pay</em>. He thought a speculative light had appeared in Thom&rsquo;s
blue eyes.</p>

<p>Aludra separated one bundle from a number like it, a
short roll of heavy, oiled cloth almost as fat as her arms would
go around. Setting it down on the straw, she undid the binding
cords and unrolled the cloth across the floor. Four rows of pockets
ran along the length of it, the pockets in each row larger than
those in the one before. Each pocket held a wax-coated cylinder of
paper just large enough for its end, trailing a dark cord, to stick
out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fireworks,&rdquo; Thom said. &ldquo;I knew it. Aludra, you must
not do this. You can sell those for enough to live ten days or more
at a good inn, and eat well every day. Well, anywhere but here in
Aringill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kneeling beside the long strip of oiled cloth, she
sniffed at him. &ldquo;Be quiet, you old one you.&rdquo; She made it sound not
unkindly. &ldquo;I am not allowed to show gratitude? You think I would
give you this if I had no more for selling? Attend me closely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat squatted beside her, fascinated. He had seen
fireworks twice in his life. Peddlers had brought them to Emond&rsquo;s
Field, at great expense to the Village Council. When he was ten, he
had tried to cut one open to see what was inside, and had caused an
uproar. Bran al&rsquo;Vere, the Mayor, had cuffed him; Doral Barran, who
had been the Wisdom then, had switched him; and his father had
strapped him when he got home. Nobody in the village would talk to
him for a month, except for Rand and Perrin, and they mostly told
him what a fool he had been. He reached out to touch one of the
cylinders. Aludra slapped his hand away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Attend me first, I say! These smallest, they will
make a loud bang, but no more.&rdquo; They were the size of his little
finger. &ldquo;These next, they make a bang and a bright light. The next,
they make the bang, and the light, and many sparkles. The last&rdquo;&mdash;these were fatter than his thumb&mdash;&ldquo;make all of those
things, but the sparkles, they are many colors. Almost like a
nightflower, but not up in the sky.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Nightflower?</em> Mat thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be especially careful of these. You see,
the fuse, it is very long.&rdquo; She saw his blank look, and waggled one
of the long, dark cords at him. &ldquo;This, this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where you put the fire,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I know that.&rdquo;
Thom made a sound in his throat and stroked his mustaches with a
knuckle as if covering a smile.</p>

<p>Aludra grunted. &ldquo;Where you put the fire. Yes. Do not
stay close to any of them, but these largest, you run away from
when you light the fuse. You comprehend me?&rdquo; She briskly rolled up
the long cloth. &ldquo;You may sell these if you wish, or use them.
Remember, you must never put this close to fire. Fire will make
them all explode. So many as this at once, it could destroy a
house, maybe.&rdquo; She hesitated over retying the cords, then added,
&ldquo;And there is one last thing, which you may have heard. Do not cut
open any of these, as some great fools do to see what is inside.
Sometimes when what is inside touches air, it will explode without
the need of fire. You can lose fingers, or even a hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that,&rdquo; Mat said dryly.</p>

<p>She frowned at him as if wondering whether he meant
to do it anyway, then finally pushed the rolled bundle toward him.
&ldquo;Here. I must go now, before these sons of goats awaken.&rdquo; Glancing
at the still open door, and the rain falling in the night beyond,
she sighed. &ldquo;Perhaps I will find somewhere else dry. I think I will
go toward Lugard, tomorrow. These pigs, they will expect me to go
to Caemlyn, yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was even further to Lugard than to Caemlyn, and
Mat suddenly remembered that hard end of bread. And she had said
she had no money. The fireworks would buy no meals until she found
someone who could afford them. She had never even looked at the
gold and silver that had spilled from his pockets when he fell; it
glittered and sparkled among the straw in the lantern light. <em>
Ah, Light, I cannot let her go hungry, I suppose</em>. He scooped
up as much as he could reach quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Aludra? I have plenty, you can see. I
thought perhaps&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He held out the coins toward her. &ldquo;I can
always win more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She paused with her cloak half around her shoulders,
then smiled at Thom as she swept it the rest of the way on. &ldquo;He is
young yet, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is young,&rdquo; Thom agreed. &ldquo;And not half so hard as
he would like to think himself. Sometimes he is not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat glowered at both of them and lowered his
hand.</p>

<p>Lifting the shafts of her cart, Aludra got it turned
around and started for the door, giving Tammuz a kick in the ribs
as she passed. He groaned groggily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like to know something, Aludra,&rdquo; Thom said.
&ldquo;How did you light that lantern so quickly in the dark?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stopping short of the door, she smiled over her
shoulder at him. &ldquo;You wish me to tell you all of my secrets? I am
grateful, but I am not in love. That secret, not even the Guild
knows, for it is my discovery alone. I will tell you this much.
When I know how to make it work properly, and work only when I want
it to, sticks will make my fortune for me.&rdquo; Throwing her weight
against the shafts, she pulled the cart into the rain, and the
night swallowed her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sticks?&rdquo; Mat said. He wondered if she might not be a
little strange in the head.</p>

<p>Tammuz groaned again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Best we do the same as she, boy,&rdquo; Thom said. &ldquo;Else
it&rsquo;s a choice between slitting four throats and maybe spending the
next few days explaining ourselves to the Queen&rsquo;s Guards. These
look the sort who&rsquo;d set them on us out of spite. And they have
enough to be spiteful for, I suppose.&rdquo; One of Tammuz&rsquo;s companions
twitched as if coming to, and muttered something
incomprehensible.</p>

<p>By the time they had gathered everything and saddled
the horses, Tammuz was up on his hands and knees with his head
hanging, and the others were stirring and groaning, too.</p>

<p>Swinging into his saddle, Mat stared at the rain
outside the open door, falling harder than ever. &ldquo;A bloody hero,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Thom, if I ever look like acting the hero again, you kick
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what would you have done differently?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat scowled at him, then pulled up his hood and
spread the tail of his cloak over the fat roll tied behind the high
cantle of his saddle. Even with oiled cloth, a little more
protection from the rain could not hurt. &ldquo;Just kick me!&rdquo; He booted
his horse in the ribs and galloped into the rainy night.</p>
