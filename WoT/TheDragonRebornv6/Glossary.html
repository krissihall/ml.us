<p class="drop"><em>A NOTE ON DATES IN THIS GLOSSARY.</em> Three systems
of recording dates have been in general use since the Breaking of
the World. The first recorded years After the Breaking (AB). Since
the years of the Breaking and immediately after were years of
almost total chaos, and since this calendar was adopted a good
hundred years after the end of the Breaking, its starting point was
arbitrarily assigned. At the end of the Trolloc Wars many records
had been lost, so much so that there was argument about the exact
year under the old system. A new calendar was therefore
established, dating from the end of the Wars and celebrating the
supposed freedom of the world from the Trolloc threat. This second
calendar recorded each year as Free Year (FY). After the
disruption, death, and destruction caused by the War of the Hundred
Years, a third calendar came into being. This calendar, of the New
Era (NE), is currently in use.</p>

<br>
<br>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Accepted, the</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Young women in training to be Aes Sedai who have
reached a certain level of power and passed certain tests. It
normally takes five to ten years to be raised from novice to the
Accepted. Accepted are somewhat less confined by rules than
novices, and are allowed to choose their own areas of study, within
limits. An Accepted has the right to wear a Great Serpent ring, but
only on the third finger of her left hand. When an Accepted is
raised to the Aes Sedai, she chooses her Ajah, gains the right to
wear the shawl, and may wear the ring on any finger or not at all
as circumstances warrant.</dd>

<dt><strong>Aes Sedai</strong> (EYEZ seh-DEYE):</dt>

<dd>Wielders of the One Power. Since the Time of Madness, all
surviving Aes Sedai are women. Widely distrusted and feared, even
hated, they are blamed by many for the Breaking of the World, and
are thought to meddle in the affairs of nations. At the same time,
few rulers will be without an Aes Sedai adviser, even in lands
where the existence of such a connection must be kept secret. After
some years of channeling the One Power, Aes Sedai take on an
ageless quality, so that an Aes Sedai who is old enough to be a
grandmother may show no signs of age except perhaps a few gray
hairs. <em><strong>See also</strong></em> Ajah; Amyrlin Seat; Time
of Madness.</dd>

<dt><strong>Age of Legends</strong>:</dt>

<dd>The Age ended by the War of the Shadow and the Breaking of the
World. A time when Aes Sedai performed wonders now only dreamed of.
<em><strong>See also</strong></em> Wheel of Time; Breaking of the
World; War of the Shadow.</dd>

<dt><strong>Aiel</strong> (eye-EEL):</dt>

<dd>The people of the Aiel Waste. Fierce and hardy. Also called
Aielmen. They veil their faces before they kill, giving rise to the
saying &ldquo;acting like a black-veiled Aiel&rdquo; to describe someone who is
being violent. Deadly warriors with weapons or with nothing but
their bare hands, they will not touch a sword. Their pipers play
them into battle with the music of dances, and Aielmen call battle
&ldquo;the dance,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the dance of spears.&rdquo; <em><strong>See
also</strong></em> Aiel warrior societies; Aiel Waste.</dd>

<dt><strong>Aiel War, the</strong>:</dt>

<dd>(976-978 NE) When King Laman of Cairhien cut down
<em>Avendoraldera</em>, several clans of the Aiel crossed the Spine of the
World. They looted and burned the capital city of Cairhien as well
as many other cities and towns, and the conflict extended into
Andor and Tear. The conventional view is that the Aiel were finally
defeated at the Battle of the Shining Walls, before Tar Valon, but
in fact, Laman was killed in that battle, and having done what they
came for, the Aiel recrossed the Spine. <em><strong>See
also</strong></em> <em>Avendoraldera</em>; Cairhien.</dd>

<dt><strong>Aiel warrior societies</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Aiel warriors are all members of one of the warrior societies,
such as the Stone Dogs (<em>Shae&rsquo;en M&rsquo;taal</em>), the Red Shields
(<em>Aethan Dor</em>), or the Maidens of the Spear (<em>Far Dareis
Mai</em>). Each society has its own customs, and sometimes specific
duties. For example, Red Shields act as police. Stone Dogs often
vow not to retreat once battle has been joined, and will die to the
last man if necessary to fulfill this vow. The clans of the Aiel&mdash;among them the Goshien, Reyn, Shaarad, and Taardad Aiel&mdash;frequently fight among themselves, but members of the same
society will not fight one another even if their clans are doing
so. In this way, there are always lines of contact between the
clans even when they are in open warfare. <em><strong>See
also</strong></em> Aiel; Aiel Waste; <em>Far Dareis Mai</em>.</dd>

<dt><strong>Aiel Waste</strong>:</dt>

<dd>The harsh, rugged, and all-but-waterless land east of the Spine
of the World. Called the Three-fold Land by the Aiel. Few outsiders
venture there, not only because water is almost impossible to find
for one not born there, but because the Aiel consider themselves at
war with all other peoples and do not welcome strangers. Only
peddlers, gleemen, and the Tuatha&rsquo;an are allowed safe entry, and
contact even with them is limited.</dd>

<dt><strong>Ajah</strong> (AH-jah):</dt>

<dd>Societies among the Aes Sedai to which all Aes Sedai except the
Amyrlin Seat belong. They are designated by colors: Blue, Red,
White, Green, Brown, Yellow, and Gray. Each follows a specific
philosophy of the use of the One Power and the purposes of the Aes
Sedai. For example, the Red Ajah bends all its energies to finding
men who are attempting to wield the Power and to gentling them. The
Brown Ajah, on the other hand, forsakes involvement with the
mundane world and dedicates itself to seeking knowledge, while the
White Ajah, largely eschewing both the world and the value of
worldly knowledge, devotes itself to questions of philosophy and
truth. The Green Ajah (called the Battle Ajah during the Trolloc
Wars) holds itself ready to counter any new Dreadlords when Tarmon
Gai&rsquo;don comes. There are rumors of a Black Ajah, dedicated to
serving the Dark One.</dd>

and who could wield the One Power to a degree now unknown, changed
the face of the earth. They caused great earthquakes, leveled old
mountain ranges and raised new mountains, lifted dry land where
seas had been and made the ocean rush in where dry land had been.
Many parts of the world were completely depopulated, and the

<dd>Both a nation along the Spine of the World and the capital city
of that nation. The city was burned and looted during the Aiel War, as were many other towns and villages. The subsequent abandonment of farmland near the Spine of the World made necessary the importation of great quantities of grain. The assassination of King Galldrian (998 NE) has resulted in a civil war among the noble Houses for succession to the Sun Throne, in the disruption of grain shipments, and in famine.

<dt><strong>Cauthon, Mat</strong> (CAW-thon, MAT):</dt>

<dd>A young man from the Two Rivers. Full name: Matrim (MAT-rihm)
Cauthon.</dd>

<dt><strong>channel</strong> (verb):</dt>

<dd>To control the flow of the One Power. <em><strong>See
also</strong></em> One Power.</dd>

<dt><strong>Children of the Light</strong>:</dt>

<dd>A society holding strict ascetic beliefs, dedicated to the
defeat of the Dark One and the destruction of all Darkfriends.
Founded during the War of the Hundred Years by Lothair Mantelar
(LOH-thayr MAHN-tee-LAHR) to proselytize against the increasing
numbers of Darkfriends, they evolved during the war into a
completely military organization, extremely rigid in their beliefs,
and completely certain that only they know the truth and the right.
They hate Aes Sedai, considering them, and any who support or
befriend them, Darkfriends. They are known disparagingly as
Whitecloaks. Their sign is a golden sunburst on a field of
white. <em><strong>See also</strong></em> Questioners.</dd>

<dt><strong>Chronicles, Keeper of the</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Second in authority to the Amyrlin Seat among the Aes Sedai,
she also acts as secretary to the Amyrlin. Chosen for life by the

<dd>The Great Game, also known as the Game of Houses. Name given

gah-LAHD-eh-drihd):</dt>

<dd>Half-brother to Elayne and Gawyn. His sign is a winged silver
sword, point down.</dd>

prison.</dd>

<dt><strong>Darkhounds</strong>:</dt>
<dd><em>See</em> Wild Hunt.</dd>



<dt><strong>Dark One</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Most common name, used in every land, for Shai&rsquo;tan. The source
of evil, antithesis of the Creator. Imprisoned by the Creator at
the moment of Creation in a prison at Shayol Ghul. An attempt to
free him from that prison brought about the War of the Shadow, the
tainting of <em>saidin</em>, the Breaking of the World, and the end
of the Age of Legends.</dd>

<dt><strong>Dark One, naming the</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Saying the true name of the Dark One (Shai&rsquo;tan) draws his
attention, inevitably bringing ill fortune at best, disaster at
worst. For that reason, many euphemisms are used, among them the
Dark One, Father of Lies, Sightblinder, Lord of the Grave, Shepherd
of the Night, Heartsbane, Soulsbane, Heartfang, Grassburner, and Leafblighter.
Someone who seems to be inviting ill fortune is often said to be
&ldquo;naming the Dark One.&rdquo;</dd>

<dt><strong>Daughter-Heir</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Title of the heir to the throne of Andor. The eldest daughter
of the queen succeeds her mother on the throne. Without a surviving
daughter, the throne goes to the nearest female blood relation of
the queen.</dd>

<dt><strong>Daughter of the Night</strong>:</dt>

<dd><em>See</em> Lanfear.</dd>

<dt><strong>Dragon, false</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Occasionally men claim to be the Dragon Reborn, and sometimes
one of them gains following enough to require an army to put it
down. Some have begun wars that involved many nations. Over the
centuries most of these have been men unable to channel the One
Power, but a few could do so. All, however, either disappeared or
were captured or killed without fulfilling any of the Prophecies
concerning the Rebirth of the Dragon. These men are called false
Dragons. Among those who could channel, the most powerful were
Raolin Darksbane (335-36AB), Yurian Stonebow (circa 1300-1308 AB),
Davian (FY 351), Guaire Amalasan (FY 939-43), and Logain (997 NE).
<em><strong>See also</strong></em> Dragon Reborn.</dd>

<dt><strong>Dragon, Prophecies of the</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Little known and seldom spoken of, the Prophecies, given in
<em>The Karaethon Cycle</em>, foretell that the Dark One will be
freed again to touch the world. And that Lews Therin Telamon, the
Dragon, Breaker of the World, will be reborn to fight Tarmon
Gai&rsquo;don, the Last Battle against the Shadow. <em><strong>See
also</strong></em> Dragon, the.</dd>

<dt><strong>Dragon, the</strong>:</dt>

<dd>The name by which Lews Therin Telamon was known during the War
of the Shadow. In the madness that overtook all male Aes Sedai,
Lews Therin killed every living person who carried any of his
blood, as well as everyone he loved, thus earning the name
Kinslayer. <em><strong>See also</strong></em> Dragon Reborn;
Dragon, Prophecies of the.</dd>

<dt><strong>Dragon Reborn</strong>:</dt>

<dd>According to prophecy and legend the Dragon will be born again
at mankind&rsquo;s greatest hour of need to save the world. This is not
something people look forward to, both because the Prophecies say
the Dragon Reborn will bring a new Breaking to the world and
because Lews Therin Kinslayer, the Dragon, is a name to make men
shudder, even more than three thousand years after his death.

<dt><strong>Dreadlords</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Those men and women who, able to channel the One Power, went

the Trolloc forces.</dd>

<dd><em>See</em> Talents.</dd>

<dt>&nbsp;</dt>

<dt><strong>Elaida</strong> (eh-LY-da):</dt>

<dd>An Aes Sedai of the Red Ajah who advises Queen Morgase of
Andor. She sometimes has the Foretelling.</dd>

<dt><strong>Elayne of House Trakand</strong> (trah-KAND):</dt>

<dd>Queen Morgase&rsquo;s daughter, the Daughter-Heir to the Throne of
Andor. Now in training to be Aes Sedai. Her sign is a golden lily.</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dt><strong><em>Far Dareis Mai</em></strong> (FAHR DAH-rize MY):</dt>

<dd>Literally &ldquo;Maidens of the Spear.&rdquo; A warrior society of the
Aiel, which, unlike any of the others, admits women and only women.
A Maiden may not marry and remain in the society, nor may she fight
while carrying a child. Any child born to a Maiden is given to
another woman to raise, in such a way that no one knows who the
child&rsquo;s mother was. (&ldquo;You may belong to no man, nor may any man
belong to you, nor any child. The spear is your lover, your child,
and your life.&rdquo;) These children are treasured, for it is prophesied
that a child born of a Maiden will unite the clans and return the
Aiel to the greatness they knew during the Age of Legends.

societies.</dd>

<dt><strong>Five Powers, the</strong>:</dt>

<dd>There are threads to the One Power, and each person who can
channel can usually grasp some threads better than others. These
threads are named according to the sorts of things that can be done
using them&mdash;Earth, Air, Fire, Water, and Spirit&mdash;and
are called the Five Powers. Any wielder of the Power will have a
greater degree of strength with one, or possibly two, of these, and
lesser strength in the others. Some few may have great strength
with three, but since the Age of Legends no one has had great
strength with all five. Even then this was extremely rare. The
degree of strength can vary greatly between individuals, so that
some who can channel are much stronger than others. Performing
certain acts with the One Power requires ability in one or more of
the Five Powers. For example, starting or controlling a fire
requires Fire, and affecting the weather requires Air and Water,
while Healing requires Air, Water and Spirit. While Spirit was found
equally in men and in women, great ability with Earth and/or Fire
was found much more often among men; with Water and/or Air among
women. There were exceptions, but it was so often so that Earth and
Fire came to be regarded as male Powers, Air and Water as female.
Generally, no ability is considered stronger than any other, though
there is a saying among Aes Sedai: &ldquo;There is no rock so strong that
water and wind cannot wear it away, no fire so fierce that water
cannot quench it or wind snuff it out.&rdquo; It should be noted this
saying came into use long after the last male Aes Sedai was dead.
Any equivalent saying among male Aes Sedai is long lost.</dd>

<dt><strong>Flame of Tar Valon</strong>:</dt>

<dd>The symbol of Tar Valon, the Amyrlin Seat, and the Aes Sedai. A
stylized representation of a flame; a white teardrop with the point
upward.</dd>

<dt><strong>Forsaken, the</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Name given to thirteen of the most powerful Aes Sedai ever
known, who went over to the Dark One during the War of the Shadow
in return for the promise of immortality. According to both legend
and fragmentary records, they were imprisoned along with the Dark
One when his prison was resealed. Their names&mdash;among them Lanfear, Be&rsquo;lal, Sammael, Asmodean, Rahvin, and Ishamael&mdash;are still used to
frighten children.</dd>

<dt><strong>Fortress of the Light</strong>:</dt>
<dd>The great fortress of the Children of the Light, located in Amador (AH-mah-door), the capital of Amadicia (AH-mah-DEE-cee-ah). There is a King of Amadicia, but the Children rule in all but name. <strong><em>See also</em></strong> Children of the Light.</dd>

<dd>Queen Morgase&rsquo;s son, and Elayne&rsquo;s brother, who will be First Prince of the Sword when Elayne ascends to the throne. His sign is a white
boar.</dd>

<dt><strong>gentling</strong>:</dt>

<dd>The act, performed by Aes Sedai, of shutting off a male who can
channel from the One Power. This is necessary because any man who
learns to channel will go insane from the taint on <em>saidin</em>
and will almost certainly do horrible things with the Power in his
madness. A man who has been gentled can still sense the True
Source, but he cannot touch it. Whatever madness has come before
gentling is arrested by the act of gentling, but not cured by it,
and if it is done soon enough death can be averted. <em><strong>See
also</strong></em> One Power, the; stilling.</dd>

<dt><strong>gleeman</strong>:</dt>

A haunt of Trollocs, Myrddraal, and other creatures of the
Shadow.</dd>

<dt><strong>Great Hunt of the Horn, the</strong>:</dt>

<dd>A cycle of stories concerning the legendary search for the Horn
of Valere, in the years between the end of the Trolloc Wars and the
beginning of the War of the Hundred Years. If told in its entirety,
the cycle would take many days.</dd>

<dt><strong>Great Lord of the Dark</strong>:</dt>

<dd>The name by which Darkfriends refer to the Dark One, claiming
that to use his true name would be blasphemous.</dd>

<dt><strong>Great Serpent</strong>:</dt>

<dd>A symbol for time and eternity, ancient before the Age of
Legends began, consisting of a serpent eating its own tail. A ring
in the shape of the Great Serpent is awarded to women who have been

<dt><strong>Hundred Companions, the</strong>:</dt>

<dd>One hundred male Aes Sedai, among the most powerful of the Age
of Legends, who, led by Lews Therin Telamon, launched the final
stroke that ended the War of the Shadow by sealing the Dark One
back into his prison. The Dark One&rsquo;s counterstroke tainted

<dt><strong>Illuminators, Guild of</strong>:</dt>

<dd>A society that holds the secret of making fireworks. It guards this secret very closely, even to murder. The Guild gains its name from the grand displays, called Illuminations, that it provides for rulers and sometimes for great lords. Lesser fireworks are sold for use by others, but with dire warnings of the disaster that can result from attempting to learn what is inside them. The Guild chapter house is in Tanchico, the capital of Tarabon. The Guild established one other chapter house in Cairhien, but it is no longer active.</dd>

stemming from the Dark One, including the ability to cause
paralyzing fear with a look and the ability to vanish wherever
there are shadows. One of their few known weaknesses is that they
are reluctant to cross running water. In different lands they are
known by many names, among them Halfmen, the Eyeless, Shadowmen,
Lurks, and Fades.</dd>

<dt>&nbsp;</dt>

<dt><strong>Oaths, Three</strong>:</dt>

<dd>The oaths taken by an Accepted who is being raised to Aes Sedai. Spoken while holding the Oath Rod, a <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> that makes oaths binding. They are:</dd>
<dd>(1) To speak no word that is not true.</dd>
<dd>(2) To make no weapon with which one man may kill another.</dd>
<dd>(3) Never to use the One Power as a weapon except against Shadowspawn, or in the last extreme of defense of her own life, or that of her Warder, or another Aes Sedai.</dd>
<dd>These oaths were not always required, but various events before and since the Breaking caused them to be necessary. The second oath was the first adopted, in response to the War of the Power. The first oath, while held to the letter, is often circumvented by careful speaking. It is believed that the last two are inviolable.

<dt><strong>Ogier</strong> (OH-geer):</dt>

<dd>(1) A non-human race, characterized by great height (ten feet is average for adult males), broad, almost snout-like noses, and long, tufted ears. They live in areas called <em>stedding</em>. Their separation from these <em>stedding</em> after the Breaking of the World (a time called the Exile by the Ogier) resulted in what is called the Longing; an Ogier who is too long out of the <em>stedding</em> sickens and dies. Widely known as wondrous stonemasons who built the great human cities after the Breaking, they consider stonework simply something they learned during the Exile and not as important as tending the trees of the <em>stedding</em>, especially the towering Great Trees. Except for stonework, they rarely leave their <em>stedding</em> and typically have little contact with humankind. Knowledge of them among humans is sparse, and many believe Ogier to be only legends. Although believed to be a pacific people and extremely slow to anger, some old stories say they fought alongisde humans in the Trolloc Wars, and call them implacable enemies. By and large, they are extremely fond of knowledge, and their books and stories often contain information lost to humans. A typical Ogier life-span is at least three to four times that of a human.</dd>
<dd>(2) Any individual of that non-human race.</dd>

<dt><strong>Old Tongue</strong>:</dt>
<dd>The language spoken during the Age of Legends. It is generally expected that nobles and the educated will have learned to speak this, but most know only a few words.</dd>



<dt><strong>One Power, the</strong>:</dt>

<dd>The power drawn from the True Source. The vast majority of
people are completely unable to learn to channel the One Power. A
very small number can be taught to channel, and an even tinier
number have the ability inborn. For these few there is no need to
be taught; they will touch the True Source and channel the Power
whether they want to or not, perhaps without even realizing what
they are doing. This inborn ability usually manifests itself in
late adolescence or early adulthood. If control is not taught, or
self-learned (extremely difficult, with a success rate of only one
in four), death is certain. Since the Time of Madness, no man has
been able to channel the Power without eventually going completely,
horribly mad, and then, even if he has learned some control, dying
from a wasting sickness that causes the sufferer to rot alive, a
sickness caused, as is the madness, by the Dark One&rsquo;s taint on
<em>saidin</em>. For a woman the death that comes without control
of the Power is less horrible, but it is death just the same. Aes
Sedai search for girls with the inborn ability as much to save
their lives as to increase Aes Sedai numbers, and for men with it
in order to stop the terrible things they inevitably do with the
Power in their madness. <em><strong>See also</strong></em> Aes Sedai; channel; Five Powers;

<dt>&nbsp;</dt>

<dt><strong>Questioners, the</strong>:</dt>

<dd>An order within the Children of the Light. Their avowed
purposes are to discover the truth in disputations and to uncover
Darkfriends. In the search for truth and the Light, their normal
method of inquiry is by torture; their normal attitude that they
know the truth already and must only make their victim confess to
it. The Questioners refer to themselves as the Hand of the Light,
the Hand that digs out truth, and at times act as if they were
entirely separate from the Children and the Council of the
Anointed, which commands the Children. The head of the Questioners
is the High Inquisitor, who sits on the Council of the Anointed.
Their sign is a blood-red shepherd&rsquo;s crook.</dd>

<dt>&nbsp;</dt>

<dt><strong><em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em></strong> (SAH-ahn-GREE-ahl):</dt>

<dd>Any one of a number of objects that allow an individual to
channel much more of the One Power than would otherwise be possible
or safe. A <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em> is like unto, but much more powerful
than, an <em>angreal</em>. The amount of the Power that can be
wielded with a <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em> compares to the amount of the
Power that can be handled with an <em>angreal</em> as the power
wielded with the aid of an <em>angreal</em> does to the amount of
the Power that can be handled unaided. Remnants of the Age of
Legends, the means of making <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em> is no longer
known. Only a handful remain, far fewer even than
<em>angreal</em>.</dd>

People of the Sea. Inhabitants of islands in the Aryth (AH-rihth)
Ocean and the Sea of Storms, they spend little time on those
islands, living most of their lives on their ships. Most seaborne
trade is carried by the Sea Folk&rsquo;s ships.</dd>

<dt><strong><em>stedding</em></strong> (STEHD-ding):</dt>

<dd>An Ogier (OH-geer) homeland. Many <em>stedding</em> have been
abandoned since the Breaking of the World. They are shielded in
some way, no longer understood, so that within them no Aes Sedai
can channel the One Power, nor even sense that the True Source
exists. Attempts to wield the One Power from outside a
<em>stedding</em> have no effect inside a <em>stedding</em>
boundary. No Trolloc will enter a <em>stedding</em> unless driven,
and even a Myrddraal will do so only at the greatest need and then
with the greatest reluctance and distaste. Even Darkfriends, if
truly dedicated, feel uncomfortable within a
<em>stedding</em>.</dd>

<dt><strong>stilling</strong>:</dt>

<dd>The act, performed by Aes Sedai, of shutting off a woman who
can channel from the One Power. A woman who has been stilled can
sense the True Source, but she cannot touch it.</dd>

<dt><strong>Stone Dogs</strong>:</dt>

<dd><em>See</em> Aiel warrior societies.</dd>
<dt><strong>Stone of Tear</strong>:</dt>

<dd>A great fortress in the city of Tear, said to have been made soon after the Breaking of the World, and to have been made using the One Power. It has been besieged or attacked countless times, but never successfully. The Stone is mentioned twice in the Prophecies of the Dragon. Once they say the Stone will never fall until the People of the Dragon come. In another place, they say the Stone will never fall until the Dragon&rsquo;s hand wields the Sword That Cannot Be Touched, <em>Callandor</em>. Some believe that these Prophecies account for the antipathy of the High Lords to the One Power, and for the Tairen law that forbids channelling. Despite this antipathy, the Stone contains a collection of <em>an&rsquo;greal</em> and <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> rivaling that of the White Tower, a collection which was gathered, some say, in an attempt to diminish the glare of possessing <em>Callandor</em>.</dd>

<dt><strong>Talents</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Abilities in the use of the One Power in specific areas. The best known of these, of course, is Healing. Some, such as Traveling, the ability to shift oneself from one place to another without crossing the intervening space, have been lost. Others such as Foretelling (the ability to foretell future events, but in a general way) are now found only rarely if at all. Another Talent long thought lost is Dreaming, which involves, among other things, interpreting the Dreamer&rsquo;s dreams to foretell future events in more specific fashion than Foretelling does. Some Dreamers had the ability to enter <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, the World of Dreams, and (it is said) even other people&rsquo;s dreams. The last known Dreamer was Corianin Nedeal, who died in 526  NE.</dd>

Unlike other dreams, what happens to living things in the World of Dreams is real; a wound taken there will still be there on awakening, and one who dies there does not wake at all.</dd>

<dt><strong><em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em></strong> (TEER-ahn-GREE-ahl):</dt>

<dd>Any one of a number of remnants of the Age of Legends that use
the One Power. Unlike <em>angreal</em> and <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>,
each <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> was made to do a particular thing. For
example, one makes oaths taken within it binding. Some are used by
Aes Sedai, but their original purposes are largely unknown. Some
will kill or destroy the ability to channel of any woman who uses
them. <em><strong>See also</strong></em> <em>angreal</em>;
<em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>.</dd>


<dt><strong>Tigraine</strong> (tee-GRAIN):</dt>

<dd>As Daughter-Heir of Andor, she married Taringail Damodred and
bore his son Galadedrid. Her disappearance in 972 NE, shortly after
her brother Luc vanished in the Blight, led to the struggle in
Andor called the Succession, and caused the events in Cairhien that
eventually brought on the Aiel War. Her sign was a woman&rsquo;s hand
gripping a thorny rose stem with a white blossom.</dd>

<dt><strong>Time of Madness</strong>:</dt>

<dd>The years after the Dark One&rsquo;s counterstroke tainted the male
half of the True Source, when male Aes Sedai went mad and Broke the
World. The exact duration of this period is unknown, but it is
believed to have lasted nearly one hundred years. It ended
completely only with the death of the last male Aes Sedai.

<dt><strong>Treesinger</strong>:</dt>

<dd>An Ogier who has the ability to sing to trees (called
&ldquo;treesong&rdquo;), either healing them, or helping them to grow and
flower, or making things from the wood without damaging the tree.
Objects made in this manner are called &ldquo;sung wood&rdquo; and are highly
prized. Few Ogier remain who are Treesingers; the Talent seems to
be dying out.</dd>



<dt><strong>Trollocs</strong> (TRAHL-lohks):</dt>

<dd>Creatures of the Dark One, created during the War of the
Shadow. Huge in stature, they are a twisted blend of animal and
human stock. Vicious by nature, they kill for the pure pleasure of
killing. Deceitful in the extreme, they cannot be trusted unless
coerced by fear. They are divided into tribe-like bands, among them
the Dha&rsquo;vol, the Ko&rsquo;bal, and the Dhai&rsquo;mon.</dd>

<dt><strong>Trolloc Wars</strong>:</dt>

<dd>A series of wars, beginning about 1000 AB and lasting more than
three hundred years, during which Trolloc armies ravaged the world.
Eventually the Trollocs were slain or driven back into the Great
Blight, but some nations ceased to exist, while others were almost
depopulated. All records of the time are fragmentary.</dd>

<dt><strong>True Source</strong>:</dt>

<dd>The driving force of the universe, which turns the Wheel of
Time. It is divided into a male half (<em>saidin</em>) and a female half
(<em>saidar</em>), which work at the same time with and against each other.
Only a man can draw on <em>saidin</em>, only a woman on
<em>saidar</em>. Since the beginning of the Time of Madness,
<em>saidin</em> has been tainted by the Dark One&rsquo;s touch.

<dt><strong>Tuatha&rsquo;an</strong> (too-AH-thah-AHN):</dt>

<dd>A wandering folk, also known as the Tinkers and as the
Traveling People, who live in brightly painted wagons and follow a
totally pacifist philosophy called the Way of the Leaf. Things
mended by Tinkers are often better than new. They are among the few
who can cross the Aiel Waste unmolested, for the Aiel strictly
avoid all contact with them.</dd>

<dt><strong>Verin Mathwin</strong> (VEHR-ihn MAH-thwin):</dt>

<dd>An Aes Sedai of the Brown Ajah.</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>

<dt><strong>Warder</strong>:</dt>

<dd>A warrior bonded to an Aes Sedai. The bonding is a thing of the
One Power, and by it he gains such gifts as quick healing, the
ability to go long periods without food, water, or rest, and the
ability to sense the taint of the Dark One at a distance. So long
as a Warder lives, the Aes Sedai to whom he is bonded knows he is
alive however far away he is, and when he dies she will know the
moment and manner of his death. The bonding does not tell her how
far he is, though, nor in what direction. While most Ajahs believe
an Aes Sedai may have one Warder bonded to her at a time, the Red
Ajah refuses to bond any Warders at all, while the Green Ajah
believe an Aes Sedai may bond as many Warders as she wishes.
Ethically the Warder must accede to the bonding, but it has been
known to be done involuntarily. What the Aes Sedai gain from the
bonding is a closely held secret. <em><strong>See
also</strong></em> Aes Sedai.</dd>

<dt><strong>War of Power</strong>:</dt>

<dd><em>See</em> War of the Shadow.</dd>

<dt><strong>War of the Hundred Years</strong>:</dt>

<dd>A series of overlapping wars among constantly shifting
alliances, precipitated by the death of Artur Hawkwing and the
resulting struggle for his empire. It lasted from FY 994 to FY
1117. The war depopulated large parts of the lands between the
Aryth Ocean and the Aiel Waste, from the Sea of Storms to the Great
Blight. So great was the destruction that only fragmentary records
of the time remain. The empire of Artur Hawkwing was pulled apart
in the wars, and the nations of the present day were formed.

<dt><strong>War of the Second Dragon</strong>:</dt>

<dd>The war fought (FY 939-43) against the false Dragon Guaire Amalasan. During this war a young king named Artur Tanreall Paendrag, later known as Artur Hawkwing, rose to overwhelming prominence.</dd>

<dt><strong>War of the Shadow</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Also known as the War of Power, it ended the Age of Legends. It
began shortly after the attempt to free the Dark One, and soon
involved the whole world. In a world where even the memory of war
had been forgotten, every facet of war was rediscovered, often
twisted by the Dark One&rsquo;s touch on the world, and the One Power was
used as a weapon. The war was ended by the resealing of the Dark
One into his prison. <em><strong>See also</strong></em> Hundred

<dd>Time is a wheel with seven spokes, each spoke an Age. As the
Wheel turns, the Ages come and go, each leaving memories that fade
to legend, then to myth, and are forgotten by the time that Age
comes again. The Pattern of an Age is slightly different each time
an Age comes, and each time it is subject to greater change, but
each time it is the same Age.</dd>

<dt><strong>wilder</strong>:</dt>

<dd>A woman who has learned to channel the One Power on her own, surviving the crisis as only one in four does. Such women usually build barriers against knowing what it is they are doing, but if these can be broken down, wilders are among the most powerful of channelers. The term is often used in derogatory fashion.</dd>

<dt><strong>Wild Hunt</strong>:</dt>

<dd>It is believed by many that the Dark One (often called Grim, or Old Grim) rides out in the night with the &ldquo;black dogs,&rdquo; or the Darkhounds, hunting souls. This is the Wild Hunt. Rain can keep the Darkhounds out of the night, but once they are on the trail, they must be confronted and defeated or the victim&rsquo;s death is inevitable. It is believed that merely seeing the Wild Hunt pass means imminent death for the viewer or for someone dear to the viewer.</dd>

<dt><strong>Wisdom</strong>:</dt>

<dd>In villages, a woman chosen by the Women&rsquo;s Circle for her
knowledge of such things as healing, and foretelling the weather,
as well as for common good sense. A position of great
responsibility and authority, both actual and implied. She is
