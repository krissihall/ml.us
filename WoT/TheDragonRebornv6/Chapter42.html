<h4><em>Easing the Badger</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
hubbub of the city quickly submerged Zarine&rsquo;s
laughter&mdash;if that was what it was&mdash;beneath all the
clamor that Perrin remembered from Caemlyn and Cairhien. The
sounds were different here, slower, and pitched differently, but
they were the same, too. Boots and wheels and hooves on rough,
uneven paving stones, cart and wagon axles squealing, music and
song and laughter drifting from inns and taverns. Voices. A hum of
voices like putting his head into a giant beehive. A great city,
living.</p>

<p>From down a side street he heard the clang of hammer
on anvil, and shifted his shoulders unconsciously. He missed the
hammer and tongs in his hands, the white-hot metal giving off
sparks as his blows shaped it. The smithy sounds faded behind,
buried under the rumble of carts and wagons, and the babble of
shopkeepers and people in the streets. Under all the smells of
people and horses, cooking and baking, and a hundred scents he had
found peculiar to cities lay the smell of marsh and salt water.</p>

<p>He was surprised the first time they came to a bridge
inside the city&mdash;a low arch of stone over a waterway no more
than thirty paces across&mdash;but by the third such bridge, he
realized that Illian was crisscrossed by as many canals as streets,
with men poling laden barges as often as plying whips to move heavy
wagons. Sedan chairs wove through the crowds in the streets, and
occasionally the lacquered coach of some wealthy merchant or a
noble, with crest or House sign painted large on the doors. Many of
the men wore peculiar beards that left their upper lip bare, while
the women seemed to favor hats with wide brims and attached scarves
that they wound around their necks.</p>

<p>Once they crossed a great square, many hides in
extent, surrounded by huge columns of white marble at least fifteen
spans tall and two spans thick, supporting nothing but a wreath of
carved olive branches at the top of each. A huge, white palace
stood at either end of the square, each all columned walks and airy
balconies, slender towers and purple roofs. Each reflected the
other exactly, at first glance, but then Perrin realized that one
was just a fraction smaller in each dimension, its towers perhaps
less than a pace shorter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The King&rsquo;s Palace,&rdquo; Zarine said against his back,
&ldquo;and the Great Hall of the Council. It is said the first King of
Illian said the Council of Nine could have any palace they wished,
just as long as they did not try to build one larger than his. So
the Council copied the King&rsquo;s palace exactly, but two feet smaller
in every measurement. That has been the way of Illian ever since.
The King and the Council of Nine duel with each other, and the
Assemblage struggles with both, and so while they carry on their
battles, the people live much as they wish, with none to look over
their shoulders too much. It is not a bad way to live, if you must
be tied to one city. You would also like to know, I think,
blacksmith, that this is the Square of Tammaz, where I took the
Hunter&rsquo;s Oath. I think I will end up teaching you so much, no one
will notice the hay in your hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin held his tongue with an effort, resolving not
to stare so openly again.</p>

<p>No one seemed to take Loial as anything much out of
the ordinary. A few people looked at him twice, and some small
children scampered along in their wake for a time, but it appeared
that Ogier were not unknown in Illian. None of the folk seemed to
notice the heat or the damp, either.</p>

<p>For once, Loial did not appear pleased with the
people&rsquo;s acceptance. His long eyebrows drooped down on his cheeks,
and his ears had wilted, though Perrin was not sure that was not
just the air. His own shirt clung to him with a mixture of sweat
and the damp air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you afraid you&rsquo;ll find other Ogier here, Loial?&rdquo;
he asked. He felt Zarine stir against his back and cursed his
tongue. He meant to let the woman know even less than Moiraine
apparently meant to tell her. That way, perhaps, she would grow
bored enough to leave. <em>If Moiraine will let her go, now. Burn
me, I don&rsquo;t want any bloody falcon perched on my shoulder, even if
she is pretty</em>.</p>

<p>Loial nodded. &ldquo;Our stonemasons sometimes come here.&rdquo;
He spoke in a whisper not only for an Ogier, but for anyone. Even
Perrin could barely hear. &ldquo;From Stedding Shangtai, I mean. It was
masons from our <em>stedding</em> who built part of Illian&mdash;the Palace of the Assemblage, the Great Hall of the Council, some
of the others&mdash;and they always send to us when repairs need
to be done. Perrin, if there are Ogier here, they will make me go
back to the <em>stedding</em>. I should have thought of it before
now. This place makes me uneasy, Perrin.&rdquo; His ears shifted
nervously.</p>

<p>Perrin moved Stepper closer and reached up to pat
Loial&rsquo;s shoulder. It was a long reach, above his head. Conscious of
Zarine at his back, he chose his words carefully. &ldquo;Loial, I do not
believe Moiraine would let them take you. You have been with us a
long time, and she seems to want you with us. She will not let them
take you, Loial.&rdquo; <em>Why not?</em> he wondered suddenly. <em>She
keeps me because she thinks I may be important to Rand, and maybe
because she doesn&rsquo;t want me telling what I know to anyone. Maybe
that&rsquo;s why she wants him to stay</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, she would not,&rdquo; Loial said in a slightly
stronger voice, and his ears perked up. &ldquo;I am very useful, after
all. She may need to travel the Ways again, and she could not
without me.&rdquo; Zarine shifted against Perrin&rsquo;s back, and he shook his
head, trying to catch Loial&rsquo;s eye. But Loial was not looking. He
seemed to have just heard what he had said, and the tufts on his
ears had fallen a little. &ldquo;I do hope it&rsquo;s not that, Perrin.&rdquo; The
Ogier looked at the city around them, and his ears went all the way
back down. &ldquo;I do not like this place, Perrin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine rode closer to Lan and spoke softly, but
Perrin managed to catch her words. &ldquo;Something is wrong in this
city.&rdquo; The Warder nodded.</p>

<p>Perrin felt an itch between his shoulders. The Aes
Sedai had sounded grim. <em>First Loial, and now her. What don&rsquo;t I
see?</em> The sun shone down on the sparkling roof tiles, made
reflections from pale stone walls. Those buildings looked as if
they might be cool, inside. The buildings were clean and bright,
and so were the people. The people.</p>

<p>At first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Men and
women moving about their business, purposeful, but slower than he
was used to further north. He thought it might be the heat, and the
bright sun. Then he spotted a baker&rsquo;s lad trotting down the street
with a big tray of fresh loaves balanced on his head; the young
fellow wore a grimace on his face that was nearly a snarl. A woman
in front of a weaver&rsquo;s shop looked as if she might bite the man
holding up the bright-colored bolts for her inspection. A juggler
on a corner ground his teeth and stared at the folk who tossed
coins into the cap lying in front of him as if he hated them. Not
everyone looked so, but it seemed to him that at least one face in
five wore anger and hatred. And he did not think they were even
aware of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; Zarine asked. &ldquo;You are tensing.
It is like holding on to a rock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something is wrong,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;I do not know
what, but something is wrong.&rdquo; Loial nodded sadly, and murmured
about how they would make him go back.</p>

<p>The buildings around them began to change as they
rode, crossing more bridges as they crossed Illian to its other
side. The pale stone was often undressed as polished, now. The
towers and palaces vanished, to be replaced by inns and warehouses.
Many of the men in the streets, and some of the women, had an oddly
rolling gait; they all had the bare feet he associated with
sailors. The smells of pitch and hemp were strong in the air, and
the scent of wood, both freshly cut and cured, with sour mud
overlying both. The canals&rsquo; odors changed, too, making his nose
wrinkle. <em>Chamber pots</em>, he thought. <em>Chamber pots and
old privies</em>. It made him feel queasy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Bridge of Flowers,&rdquo; Lan announced as they
crossed yet another low bridge. He inhaled deeply. &ldquo;And now we are
in the Perfumed Quarter. The Illianers are a poetic people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zarine stifled a laugh against Perrin&rsquo;s back.</p>

<p>As if he were suddenly impatient with the slow pace
of Illian, the Warder led them quickly through the streets to an
inn, two stories of rough, green-veined stone topped with pale
green tiles. Evening was coming on, the light growing softer as the
sun settled. It gave a little relief from the heat, but not much.
Boys seated on mounting blocks in front of the inn hopped up to
take their horses. One black-haired lad about ten asked Loial if he
were an Ogier, and when Loial said he was, the boy said, &ldquo;I did
think you did be,&rdquo; with a self-satisfied nod. He led Loial&rsquo;s big
horse away, tossing the copper Loial had given him into the air and
catching it.</p>

<p>Perrin frowned up at the inn sign for a moment before
following the others in. A white-striped badger danced on its hind
legs with a man carrying what seemed to be a silver shovel. Easing
the Badger, it read. <em>It must be some story I never
heard</em>.</p>

<p>The common room had sawdust on the floor, and tabac
smoke filled the air. It also smelled of wine, and fish cooking in
the kitchen, and a heavy, flowered perfume. The exposed beams of
the high ceiling were rough-hewn and age-dark. This early in the
evening, no more than a quarter of the stools and benches were
filled, by men in workmen&rsquo;s plain coats and vests, some with the
bare feet of sailors. All of them sat clustered as close as they
could manage around one table where a pretty, dark-eyed girl, the
wearer of the perfume, sang to the strumming of a twelve-string
bittern and danced on the tabletop with swirls of her skirt. Her
loose, white blouse had an extremely low neck. Perrin recognized
the tune&mdash;&rdquo;The Dancing Lass&rdquo;&mdash;but the words
the girl sang were different from what he knew.</p>

<p class="verse_quote">&ldquo;A Lugard girl, she came to town, to see what she could see.<br>
With a wink of her eye, and a smile on her lip,<br>
she snagged a boy or three, or three.<br>
With an ankle slim, and skin so pale,<br>
she caught the owner of a ship, a ship.<br>
With a soft little sigh, and a gay little laugh,<br>
she made her way so free.<br>
So free.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She launched into another verse, and when Perrin
realized what she was singing, his face grew hot. He had thought
nothing could shock him after seeing Tinker girls dance, but that
had only hinted at things. This girl was singing them right
out.</p>

<p>Zarine was nodding in time to the music and grinning.
Her grin widened when she looked at him. &ldquo;Why, farmboy, I do not
think I ever knew a man your age who could still blush.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He glared at her and barely stopped himself from
saying something he knew would be stupid. <em>This bloody woman has
me jumping before I can think. Light, I&rsquo;ll wager she thinks I never
even kissed a girl!</em> He tried not to listen to any more of what
the girl was singing. If he could not get the red out of his face,
Zarine was sure to make more of it.</p>

<p>A flash of startlement had passed across the face of
the proprietress when they entered. A large, round woman with her
hair in a thick roll at the back of her neck and a smell of strong
soap about her, she suppressed her surprise quickly, though, and
hurried to Moiraine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mistress Mari,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I did never think to see
you here today.&rdquo; She hesitated, eyeing Perrin and Zarine, glanced
once at Loial, but not in the searching way she looked at them. Her
eyes actually brightened at the sight of the Ogier, but her real
attention was all on &ldquo;Mistress Mari,&rdquo; She lowered her voice, &ldquo;Have
my pigeons no arrived safely?&rdquo; Lan, she seemed to accept as a part
of Moiraine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure they have, Nieda,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;I have
been away, but I am sure Adine has noted down everything you
reported.&rdquo; She eyed the girl singing on the table with no outward
disapproval, nor any other expression. &ldquo;The Badger was considerably
quieter when last I was here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, Mistress Mari, it did be that. But the louts
have no gotten over the winter yet, it does seem. I have no had a
fight in the Badger in ten years, till the tail of this winter
gone.&rdquo; She nodded toward the one man not sitting near the singer, a
fellow even bigger than Perrin, standing against the wall with his
thick arms folded, tapping his foot to the music. &ldquo;Even Bili did
have a hard time keeping them down, so I did hire the girl to take
their minds from anger. From some place in Altara, she does come.&rdquo;
She tilted her head, listening for a moment. &ldquo;A fair voice, but I
did sing it better&mdash;aye, and dance better, too&mdash;when I
did be her age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin gaped at the thought of this huge woman
capering on a table, singing that song&mdash;a bit of it came
through; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wear no shift at all. At all&rdquo;&mdash;until Zarine
fisted him hard in the short ribs. He grunted.</p>

<p>Nieda looked his way. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll mix you some honey and
sulphur, lad, for that throat. You&rsquo;ll no want to take a chill
before the weather warms, no with a pretty girl like that one on
your arm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine gave him a look that said he was interfering
with her. &ldquo;Strange that you should suffer fights,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
well remember how your nephew stops such. Has something occurred to
make people more irritable?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nieda mused for a moment. &ldquo;Perhaps. It do be hard to
say. The young lordlings do always come down to the docks for the
wenching and carousing they can no get away with where the air does
smell fresher. Perhaps they do come more often, now, since the hard
of the winter. Perhaps. And others do snap at each other more, too.
It did be a hard winter. That does make men angrier, and women as
well. All that rain, and cold. Why, I did wake two mornings to find
ice in my washbasin. No so hard as the last winter, of course, but
that did be a winter for a thousand years. Almost enough to make me
believe those travelers&rsquo; tales of frozen water falling from the
sky.&rdquo; She giggled to show how little she believed that. It was an
odd sound from such a large woman.</p>

<p>Perrin shook his head. <em>She doesn&rsquo;t believe in
snow?</em> But if she thought this weather was cool, he could
believe it of her.</p>

<p>Moiraine bent her head in thought, her hood shadowing
her face.</p>

<p>The girl on the table was beginning a new verse, and
Perrin found himself listening in spite of himself. He had never
heard of any woman doing anything remotely like what, the girl was
singing about, but it did sound interesting. He noticed Zarine
watching him listen, and tried to pretend he had not been.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has occurred out of the ordinary in Illian of
late?&rdquo; Moiraine said finally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do suppose you could call Lord Brend&rsquo;s ascension
to the Council of Nine unusual,&rdquo; Nieda said. &ldquo;Fortune prick me, I
can no remember ever hearing his name before the winter, but he did
come to the city&mdash;from somewhere near the Murandian border,
it be rumored&mdash;and did be raised inside a week. It do be said
he be a good man, and strongest of the Nine&mdash;they all do
follow his lead, it be said, though he be newest and unknown&mdash;but sometimes I do have strange dreams of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine had opened her mouth&mdash;to tell Nieda
she had meant in the last few nights, Perrin was sure&mdash;but
she hesitated, and instead said, &ldquo;What sort of strange dreams,
Nieda?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, foolishness, Mistress Mari. Just foolishness.
You do truly wish to hear it? Dreams of Lord Brend in strange
places, and walking bridges hanging in air. All fogged, these
dreams do be, but near every night they do come. Did you ever hear
of such? Foolishness, Fortune prick me! Yet, it do be odd. Bili
does say he does dream the same dreams. I do think he does hear my
dreams and copy them. Bili do be none too bright, sometimes, I do
think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may do him an injustice,&rdquo; Moiraine breathed.</p>

<p>Perrin stared at her dark hood. She had sounded
shaken, even more shaken than when she thought a new false Dragon
had risen in Ghealdan. He could not smell fear, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Moiraine
was frightened. It was a far more terrifying thought than Moiraine
angry. He could imagine her angry; he could not begin to conceive
of her afraid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How I do maunder on,&rdquo; Nieda said, patting the rolled
hair at the back of her neck. &ldquo;As if my foolish dreams do be
important.&rdquo; She giggled again. A quick giggle; this was not as
foolish as believing in snow. &ldquo;You do sound tired, Mistress Mari. I
will show you to your rooms. And then a good meal of fresh-caught
red-stripe.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Red-stripe?</em> A fish, he thought it must be;
he could smell fish cooking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rooms,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;Yes. We will take rooms. The
meal can wait. Ships. Nieda, what ships sail for Tear? Early on the
morrow. I have that which I must do tonight.&rdquo; Lan glanced at her,
frowning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For Tear, Mistress Mari?&rdquo; Nieda laughed. &ldquo;Why, none
for Tear. The Nine did forbid any ship to sail for Tear a month
gone now, nor any from Tear to call here, though I do think the Sea
Folk pay it no mind. But there do be no Sea Folk ship in the
harbor. It do be odd, that. The order of the Nine, I do mean, and
the King silent on it, when he does always raise his voice if they
but take a step without his lead. Or perhaps it be no that,
exactly. All talk do be of war with Tear, but the boatmen and
wagoneers who do carry supplies to the army do say the soldiers do
all look north, to Murandy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The paths of the Shadow are tangled,&rdquo; Moiraine said
in a tight voice. &ldquo;We will do what we must. The rooms, Nieda. And
then we will eat that meal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin&rsquo;s room was more comfortable than he expected,
given the look of the rest of the Badger. The bed was wide, the
mattress soft. The door was made of tilted slats, and when he
opened the windows, a breeze crossed the room carrying the smells
of the harbor. And something of the canals, too, but at least it
was cooling. He hung his cloak on a peg along with his quiver and
axe, and propped his bow in the corner. Everything else he left in
the saddlebags and blanketroll. The night might not be restful.</p>

<p>If Moiraine had sounded afraid before, it had been
nothing to when she said that something must be done tonight. For
an instant then, fear scent had steamed from her as from a woman
announcing that she was going to stick her hand in a hornets&rsquo; nest
and crush them with her bare fingers. <em>What in the Light is she
up to? If Moiraine is frightened, I should be terrified</em>.</p>

<p>He was not, he realized. Not terrified, or even
frightened. He felt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;excited. Ready for something to happen,
almost eager. Determined. He recognized the feelings. They were
what wolves felt just before they fought. <em>Burn me, I&rsquo;d rather
be afraid!</em></p>

<p>He was first back down to the common except for
Loial. Nieda had arranged a large table for them, with ladder-back
chairs instead of benches. She had even found a chair big enough
for Loial. The girl across the room was singing a song about a rich
merchant who, having just lost his team of horses in an improbable
way, had for some reason decided to pull his carriage himself. The
men listening around her roared with laughter. The windows showed
darkness coming on more quickly than he had expected; the air
smelled as if it might be making up to rain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This inn has an Ogier room,&rdquo; Loial said as Perrin
sat down. &ldquo;Apparently, every inn in Illian has one, in hopes of
gaining Ogier custom when the stonemasons come. Nieda claims it is
lucky, having an Ogier under the roof. I cannot think they get
many. The masons always stay together when they go Outside to work.
Humans are so hasty, and the Elders are always afraid tempers will
flare and someone will put a long handle on his axe.&rdquo; He eyed the
men around the singer as if he suspected them of it. His ears were
drooping again.</p>

<p>The rich merchant was in the process of losing his,
carriage, to more laughter. &ldquo;Did you find out whether any Ogier
from Stedding Shangtai are in Illian?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There were, but Nieda said they left during the
winter. She said they had not finished their work. I do not
understand it. The masons would not have left work undone unless
they were not paid, and Nieda said it was not that. One morning,
they were just gone, though someone saw them walking down the
Maredo Causeway in the night. Perrin, I do not like this city. I do
not know why, but it makes me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;uneasy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ogier,&rdquo; Moiraine said, &ldquo;are sensitive to some
things.&rdquo; She still had her face hidden, but Nieda had apparently
sent someone to buy her a light cloak of dark blue linen. The fear
smell was gone from her, but her voice sounded under tight control.
Lan held her chair for her; his eyes looked worried.</p>

<p>Zarine was the last down, running her fingers through
just-washed hair. The herbal scent was stronger around her than
before. She stared at the platter Nieda placed on the table and
muttered under her breath. &ldquo;I hate fish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stout woman had brought all the food on a small
cart with shelves; it was dusty in places, as if it had been
hastily brought out from the storeroom in Moiraine&rsquo;s honor. The
dishes were Sea Folk porcelain, too, if chipped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eat,&rdquo; Moiraine said, looking straight at Zarine.
&ldquo;Remember that any meal can be your last. You chose to travel with
us, so tonight you will eat fish. Tomorrow, you may die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin did not recognize the nearly round white fish
with red stripes, but they smelled good. He lifted two onto his
plate with the serving fork, and grinned at Zarine around a
mouthful. They tasted good, too, lightly spiced. <em>Eat your nasty
fish, falcon</em>, he thought. He also thought that Zarine looked
as if she might bite him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you wish me to stop the girl singing, Mistress
Mari?&rdquo; Nieda asked. She was setting bowls of peas and some sort of
stiff yellow mush on the table. &ldquo;So you can eat in quiet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Staring at her plate, Moiraine did not seem to
hear.</p>

<p>Lan listened a moment&mdash;the merchant had already
lost, in succession, his carriage, his cloak, his boots, his gold,
and the rest of his clothes, and was now reduced to wrestling a pig
for its dinner&mdash;and shook his head. &ldquo;She will not bother us.&rdquo;
He looked close to smiling for a moment, before he glanced at
Moiraine. Then the worry returned to his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is wrong?&rdquo; Zarine said. She was ignoring the
fish. &ldquo;I know something is. I have not see that much expression on
you, stone-face, since I met you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No questions!&rdquo; Moiraine said sharply. &ldquo;You will know
what I tell you and no more!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What <em>will</em> you tell me?&rdquo; Zarine
demanded.</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai smiled. &ldquo;Eat your fish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The meal went on in near silence after that, except
for the songs drifting across the room. There was one about a rich
man whose wife and daughters made a fool of him time and again
without ever deflating his self-importance, another that concerned
a young woman who decided to take a walk without any clothes, and
one that told of a blacksmith who managed to shoe himself instead
of the horse. Zarine nearly choked laughing at that one, forgot
herself enough to take a bite of fish, and suddenly grimaced as if
she had put mud in her mouth.</p>

<p><em>I won&rsquo;t laugh at her</em>, Perrin told himself.
<em>However foolish she looks, I&rsquo;ll show her what manners are</em>.
&ldquo;They taste good, don&rsquo;t they,&rdquo; he said. Zarine gave him a bitter
look, and Moiraine a frown for interrupting her thoughts, and that
was all the talk there was.</p>

<p>Nieda was clearing away the dishes and setting an
array of cheeses on the table when a stink of something vile lifted
the hackles on the back of Perrin&rsquo;s neck. It was a smell of
something that should not be, and he had smelled it twice before.
He peered about the common room uneasily.</p>

<p>The girl still sang to the knot of listeners, some
men were strolling across the floor from the door, and Bili still
leaned on the wall tapping his foot to the sounds of the bittern.
Nieda patted her rolled hair, gave the room a quick glance, and
turned to push the cart away.</p>

<p>He looked at his companions. Loial, unsurprisingly,
had pulled a book from his coat pocket and seemed to have forgotten
where he was. Zarine, absently rolling a piece of white cheese into
a ball, was eyeing first Perrin, then Moiraine, then him again,
while trying to pretend she was not. It was Lan and Moiraine he was
really interested in, though. They could sense a Myrddraal, or a
Trolloc, or any Shadowspawn, before it came closer than a few
hundred paces, but the Aes Sedai was staring distantly at the table
in front of her, and the Warder was cutting a chunk of yellow
cheese and watching her. Yet the smell of wrongness was there, as
at Jarra and the edge of Remen, and this time it was not going
away. It seemed to be coming from something within the common
room.</p>

<p>He studied the room again. Bili against the wall,
some men crossing the floor, the girl singing on the table, all the
laughing men sitting around her. <em>Men crossing the floor?</em>
He frowned at them. Six men with ordinary faces, walking toward
where he was sitting. Very ordinary faces. He was just starting to
reinspect the men listening to the girl when suddenly it came to
him that the stink of wrongness was rolling from the six. Abruptly
they had daggers in their hands, as if they had realized he had
seen them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have knives!&rdquo; he roared, and threw the cheese
platter at them.</p>

<p>The common erupted into confusion, men shouting, the
singer screaming, Nieda shouting for Bili, everything happening at
once. Lan leaped to his feet, and a ball of fire darted from
Moiraine&rsquo;s hand, and Loial snatched up his chair like a club, and
Zarine danced to one side, cursing. She had a knife in her hand,
too, but Perrin was too busy to notice much of what anyone else
did. Those men seemed to be looking straight at him, and his axe
was hanging from a peg up in his room.</p>

<p>Seizing a chair, he ripped off a thick chair leg that
ran up to make one side of the ladder-back, hurled the rest of the
chair at the men, and set about him with his long bludgeon. They
were trying to reach him with their naked steel, as if Lan and the
others were only obstacles in their way. It was a tight tangle
where all he could manage was to knock blades away from him, and
his wilder swings threatened Lan and Loial and Zarine as much as
any of his six attackers. From the corner of his eye he saw
Moiraine standing to one side, frustration on her face; they were
all so mixed together that she could do nothing without endangering
friend as well as foe. None of the knife wielders as much as
glanced at her; she was not between them and Perrin.</p>

<p>Panting, he managed to crack one of the
ordinary-looking men across the head so hard that he heard bone
splinter, and abruptly realized they were all down. It all seemed
to him to have gone on for a quarter of a hour or more, but he saw
that Bili was just halting, his large hands working as he stared at
the six men sprawled dead on the floor. Bili had not even had time
to reach the fight before it was done.</p>

<p>Lan wore a face even grimmer than usual; he began
searching the bodies, thoroughly, but with a quickness that spoke
of distaste. Loial still had his chair raised to swing; he gave a
start and set it down with an embarrassed grin. Moiraine was
staring at Perrin, and so was Zarine as she retrieved her knife
from the chest of one of the dead men. That stench of wrongness was
gone, as if it had died with them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gray Men,&rdquo; the Aes Sedai said softly, &ldquo;and after
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gray Men?&rdquo; Nieda laughed, both loud and nervously.
&ldquo;Why, Mistress Mari, next you&rsquo;ll say you do believe in boggles and
bugbears and Fetches, and Old Grim riding with the black dogs in
the Wild Hunt.&rdquo; Some of the men who had been listening to the songs
laughed, too, though they looked as uneasily at Moiraine as at the
dead men. The singer stared at Moiraine, as well, her eyes wide.
Perrin remembered that one ball of fire, before everything grew too
jumbled. One of the Gray Men had a somewhat charred look about him,
and gave off a sickly sweet burned smell.</p>

<p>Moiraine turned from Perrin to the stout woman. &ldquo;A
man may walk in the Shadow,&rdquo; the Aes Sedai said calmly, &ldquo;without
being Shadowspawn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, aye, Darkfriends.&rdquo; Nieda put her hands on
generous hips and frowned at the corpses. Lan had finished his
searching; he glanced at Moiraine and shook his head as if he had
not really expected to find anything. &ldquo;More likely thieves, though
I did never hear of thieves bold enough to come right into an inn.
I did never have even one killing in the Badger before. Bili! Clear
these out, into a canal, and put down fresh sawdust. The back way,
mind. I do no want the Watch putting their long noses into the
Badger.&rdquo; Bili nodded as if eager to be useful after failing to take
a hand earlier. He grabbed a dead man by the belt in either hand
and carried them back toward the kitchen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aes Sedai?&rdquo; the dark-eyed singer said. &ldquo;I did not
mean to offend with my common songs.&rdquo; She was covering the exposed
part of her bosom, which was most of it, with her hands. &ldquo;I can
sing others, if you would so like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sing whatever you wish, girl,&rdquo; Moiraine told her.
&ldquo;The White Tower is not so isolated from the world as you seem to
think, and I have heard rougher songs than you would sing.&rdquo; Even
so, she did not look pleased that the common now knew she was Aes
Sedai. She glanced at Lan, gathered the linen cloak around her, and
started for the door.</p>

<p>The Warder moved quickly to intercept her, and they
spoke quietly in front of the door, but Perrin could hear as well
as if they whispered right next to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to go without me?&rdquo; Lan said. &ldquo;I pledged
to keep you whole, Moiraine, when I took your bond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have always known there were some dangers you
are not equipped to handle, my Gaidin. I must go alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moiraine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She cut him off. &ldquo;Heed me, Lan. Should I fail, you
will know it, and you will be compelled to return to the White
Tower. I would not change that even if I had time. I do not mean
you to die in a vain attempt to avenge me. Take Perrin with you. It
seems the Shadow has made his importance in the Pattern known to
me, if not clear. I was a fool. Rand is so strongly <em>
ta&rsquo;veren</em> that I ignored what it must mean that he had two
others close by him. With Perrin and Mat, the Amyrlin may still be
able to affect the course of events. With Rand loose, she will have
to. Tell her what has happened, my Gaidin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You speak as if you are already dead,&rdquo; Lan said
roughly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills, and the Shadow
darkens the world. Heed me, Lan, and obey, as you swore to.&rdquo; With
that, she was gone.</p>
