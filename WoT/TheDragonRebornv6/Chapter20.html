<h4><em>Visitations</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
woman who came in, dressed all in white silk and
silver, shut the door behind her and leaned back against it to
study him with the darkest eyes Mat had ever seen. She was so
beautiful he almost forgot to breathe, with hair as black as night
held by a finely woven silver band, and as graceful in repose as
another woman would be dancing. He halfway thought that he knew
her, but he rejected the idea out of hand. No man could ever forget
a woman like her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may be passable, I suppose, once you fill out
again,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but for now, perhaps you could put on
something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For an instant Mat continued to stare at her, then
suddenly he realized he was standing there naked. Face scarlet, he
shambled to the bed, pulled the blanket around himself like a
cloak, and more fell than sat down on the edge of the mattress.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I mean, I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that is, I didn&rsquo;t expect&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He drew a deep breath. &ldquo;I apologize for your
finding me this way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He could still feel the heat in his cheeks. For a
moment he wished that Rand, whatever he had become, or even Perrin
were there to advise him. They always seemed to get on well with
women. Even girls who knew that Rand was all but promised to Egwene
used to stare at him, and they seemed to think Perrin&rsquo;s slow ways
were gentle and attractive.</p>

<p>However hard he tried, he always managed to make a
fool of himself in front of girls. As he had just done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not have visited you in this way, Mat,
except that I was here in the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;in the White Tower&mdash;&rdquo; She
smiled as if the name amused her&mdash;&ldquo;for another purpose, and I
wanted to see all of you.&rdquo; Mat&rsquo;s face reddened again, and he tugged
the blanket around him tighter, but she seemed not to have been
teasing him. More graceful than a swan, she glided to the table.
&ldquo;You are hungry. That&rsquo;s to be expected, the way they do things.
Make sure you eat all they give you. You will be surprised at how
quickly you put weight back and regain strength.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon,&rdquo; Mat said diffidently, &ldquo;but do I know you?
Meaning no offense, but you seem&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;familiar.&rdquo; She looked at him
until he began to shift uneasily. A woman like her would expect to
be remembered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may have seen me,&rdquo; she said finally. &ldquo;Somewhere.
Call me Selene.&rdquo; Her head tilted slightly; she appeared to be
waiting for him to recognize the name.</p>

<p>It tugged at the edges of memory. He thought he must
have heard it before, but he could not say when or where. &ldquo;Are you
an Aes Sedai, Selene?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; The word was soft but surprisingly
emphatic.</p>

<p>For the first time, he studied her, able now to see
more than her beauty. She was almost as tall as he was, slender
and, he suspected from the way she moved, strong. He was not sure
of her age&mdash;a year or two older than he, or maybe as much as
ten&mdash;but her cheeks were smooth. Her necklace of smooth white
stones and woven silver matched her wide belt, but she did not wear
a Great Serpent ring. The absence should not have surprised him&mdash;no Aes Sedai would ever say right out that she was not&mdash;yet it did. There was an air about her&mdash;a
self-confidence, a surety in her own power to match any queen&rsquo;s,
and something more&mdash;that he associated with Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t by any chance a novice, are you?&rdquo; He had
heard that novices wore white, but he could not really believe it
of her. <em>She makes Elayne look like a cringer</em>. Elayne.
Another name drifting into his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hardly that,&rdquo; Selene said with a wry twist to her
mouth. &ldquo;Let us just say that I am someone whose interests coincide
with yours. These&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Aes Sedai mean to use you, but you will
like it, in the main, I think. And accept it. There is no need to
convince you to seek out glory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Use me?&rdquo; The memory returned to him of thinking
that, but about Rand, that the Aes Sedai meant to use Rand, not
him. <em>They&rsquo;ve no bloody use for me. Light, they can&rsquo;t have!</em>
&ldquo;What do you mean? I&rsquo;m no one important. I am no use to anyone but
myself. What kind of glory?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew that would pull you. You, above all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her smile made his head spin. He scrubbed a hand
through his hair. The blanket slipped, and he caught it hastily
before it could fall. &ldquo;Now listen, they are not interested in me.&rdquo;
<em>What about me sounding the Horn?</em> &ldquo;I am just a farmer.&rdquo;
<em>Maybe they think I&rsquo;m tied to Rand in some way. No, Verin
said</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He was not sure what Verin had said, or Moiraine,
but he thought most Aes Sedai knew nothing at all about Rand. He
wanted to keep it that way, at least until he was a long way gone.
&ldquo;Just a simple country man. I only want to see a little of the
world and go back to my da&rsquo;s farm.&rdquo; <em>What does she mean,
glory?</em></p>

<p>Selene shook her head as if she had heard his
thoughts. &ldquo;You are more important than you yet know. Certainly more
important than these so-called Aes Sedai know. You <em>can</em>
have glory, if you know enough not to trust them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You certainly sound as if you don&rsquo;t trust them.&rdquo;
<em>So-called?</em> A thought came to him, but he could not manage
to say it. &ldquo;Are you a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Are you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; It was not the kind of
thing you accused someone of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Darkfriend?&rdquo; Selene said mockingly. She sounded
amused, not angered. She sounded contemptuous. &ldquo;One of those
pathetic followers of Ba&rsquo;alzamon who think he will give them
immortality and power? I follow no one. There is one man I could
stand beside, but I do not follow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat laughed nervously. &ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo; <em>Blood and
ashes, a Darkfriend wouldn&rsquo;t name herself Darkfriend, Probably has
a poisoned knife, if she is</em>. He had a vague memory of a woman
dressed as one nobly born, a Darkfriend with a deadly dagger in her
slender hand. &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t what I meant at all. You look&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;You
look like a queen. That&rsquo;s what I meant. Are you a Lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat, Mat, you must learn to trust me. Oh, I will use
you, too&mdash;you have too suspicious a nature, especially since
carrying that dagger, for me to deny it&mdash;but my use will gain
you wealth, and power, and glory. I will not compel you. I have
always believed men perform better if convinced rather than forced.
These Aes Sedai do not even realize how important you are, and he
will try to dissuade or kill you, but I can give you what you
desire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He?&rdquo; Mat said sharply. <em>Kill me? Light, it&rsquo;s Rand
they were after, not me. How does she know about the dagger? I
suppose the whole Tower knows</em>. &ldquo;Who wants to kill me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Selene&rsquo;s mouth tightened as if she had said too much.
&ldquo;You know what you want, Mat, and I know it every bit as well as
you. You must choose who you will trust to gain it for you. I admit
I will use you. These Aes Sedai will never do that. I will lead you
to wealth and glory. They will keep you tied to a leash until you
die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say a lot,&rdquo; Mat said, &ldquo;but how do I know any of
it is true? How do I know I can trust you any more than I can
them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By listening to what they tell you, and what they do
not. Will they tell you your father came to Tar Valon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My da was here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man named Abell Cauthon, and another named Tam
al&rsquo;Thor. They made nuisances of themselves until they gained an
audience, I have heard, wanting to know where you and your friends
were. And Siuan Sanche sent them back to the Two Rivers with empty
hands, not even letting them know you were alive. Will they tell
you that, unless you ask? Perhaps not even then, for you might try
to run away back home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My da thinks I am dead?&rdquo; Mat said slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can be told you live. I can see to it. Think on
who to trust, Mat Cauthon. Will they tell you that even now Rand
al&rsquo;Thor is trying to escape, and the one called Moiraine is hunting
him? Will they tell you that the Black Ajah infests their precious
White Tower? Will they even tell you how they mean to use you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand is trying to escape? But&mdash;&rdquo; Maybe she
knew Rand had proclaimed himself the Dragon Reborn, and maybe she
did not, but he would not tell her. <em>The Black Ajah! Blood and
bloody ashes!</em> &ldquo;Who are you, Selene? If you&rsquo;re not Aes Sedai,
what are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her smile hid secrets. &ldquo;Just remember that there is
another choice. You need not be a puppet for the White Tower or
prey for Ba&rsquo;alzamon&rsquo;s Darkfriends. The world is more complex than
you can imagine. Do as these Aes Sedai wish for the present, but
remember your choices. Will you do that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that I have much choice at all,&rdquo; he said
glumly. &ldquo;I suppose I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Selene&rsquo;s look sharpened. Friendliness sloughed off
her voice like an old snakeskin. &ldquo;Suppose? I did not come to you
like this, talk in this way, for suppose, Matrim Cauthon.&rdquo; She
stretched out a slim hand.</p>

<p>Her hand was empty, and she stood halfway across the
room, but he leaned back, away from her hand, as if she were right
on top of him with a dagger. He did not know why, really, except
that there was a threat in her eyes, and he was sure it was real.
His skin began to tingle, and his headache returned.</p>

<p>Suddenly tingle and pain vanished together, and
Selene&rsquo;s head whipped around as if listening to something beyond
the walls. A tiny frown appeared on her face, and she lowered her
hand. The frown vanished. &ldquo;We will talk again, Mat. I have much to
say to you. Remember your choices. Remember that there are many
hands that would kill you. I alone guarantee you life, and all you
seek, if you do as I say.&rdquo; She slipped out of the door as silently
and gracefully as she had entered.</p>

<p>Mat let out a long breath. Sweat ran down his face.
<em>Who in the Light is she?</em> A Darkfriend, perhaps. Except
that she had sounded as contemptuous of Ba&rsquo;alzamon as she was of
Aes Sedai. Darkfriends spoke of Ba&rsquo;alzamon the way anyone else
might speak of the Creator. And she had not asked him to conceal
her visit from the Aes Sedai.</p>

<p><em>Right</em>, he thought sourly. <em>Pardon me, Aes
Sedai, but this woman came to see me. She wasn&rsquo;t Aes Sedai, but I
think maybe she started to use the One Power on me, and she said
she wasn&rsquo;t a Darkfriend, but she did say you mean to use me, and
the Black Ajah&rsquo;s in your Tower. Oh, and she said I&rsquo;m important. I
don&rsquo;t know how. You don&rsquo;t mind if I leave now, do you?</em></p>

<p>Going was beginning to be a better idea by the
minute. He slid awkwardly off the bed and made his way unsteadily
to the wardrobe, still clutching his blanket around him. His boots
were on the floor inside, and his cloak hung from a peg, under his
belt, with pouch and sheathed belt knife. It was just a country
knife, with a stout blade, but it could do as much as any fine
dagger. The rest of his clothes&mdash;two sturdy wool coats, three
pairs of breeches, half a dozen linen shirts and smallclothes&mdash;had been brushed or washed as required, and neatly folded on
the shelves that took up one side of the wardrobe. He felt the
pouch hanging from the belt, but it was empty. Its contents lay
jumbled on a shelf with what had been emptied from his pockets.</p>

<p>He brushed aside a redhawk&rsquo;s feather, a smooth,
striped rock he had liked the colors of, his razor, and his
bone-handled pocketknife, and freed his wash-leather purse from
some coils of spare bowstring. When he tugged it open, he found his
memory had been all too good in this instance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two silver marks and a handful of copper,&rdquo; he
muttered. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t get far on that.&rdquo; Once it would have seemed a
small fortune to him, but that had been before he left Emond&rsquo;s
Field.</p>

<p>He stooped to peer back into the shelf. <em>Where are
they?</em> He began to be afraid the Aes Sedai might have thrown
them out, the way his mother would if she had ever found them. <em>
Where</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? He felt a surge of relief. Way in the back,
behind his tinderbox and ball of twine for snares and the like,
were his two leather dice cups.</p>

<p>They rattled as he pulled them out, but he still
popped off the tight fitting round caps. Everything was as it
should be. Five dice carved with symbols, for crowns, and five
marked with spots. The spotted dice would do for a number of games,
but more men seemed to play crowns than anything else. With these,
his two marks would become enough to take him far away from Tar
Valon. <em>Away from Aes Sedai and Selene, both</em>.</p>

<p>A peremptory knock was followed immediately by the
door opening. He whirled around. The Amyrlin Seat and the Keeper of
the Chronicles were entering. He would have recognized them even
without the Amyrlin&rsquo;s broad, striped stole, and the Keeper&rsquo;s
narrower blue stole. He had seen them once and only once, a long
way from Tar Valon, but he could not forget the two most powerful
women among the Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>The Amyrlin&rsquo;s eyebrows rose at the sight of him
standing there with the blanket hanging from his shoulders and his
purse and dice cups in his hands. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you will need
those for a while yet, my son,&rdquo; she said dryly. &ldquo;Put them up and
get back to bed before you fall on your face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He hesitated, his back stiffening, but his knees
chose that moment to wobble, and the two Aes Sedai were looking at
him, dark eyes and blue alike appearing to read his every
rebellious thought. He did as he was told, holding the blanket
around him with both hands. He lay down straight as a board, not
sure what else he could do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you feeling?&rdquo; the Amyrlin asked briskly as
she put a hand on his head. Goose bumps covered his skin. Had she
done something with the One Power, or was it being touched by an
Aes Sedai that made him feel a chill?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;Why, I am ready to be on my
way. Just let me say goodbye to Egwene and Nynaeve, and I&rsquo;ll be out
of your hair. I mean, I will go&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;uh, Mother.&rdquo; Moiraine and
Verin had not seemed to care much how he talked, but this was the
Amyrlin Seat, after all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; the Amyrlin said. She pulled the
high-backed chair around, closer to the bed, and sat, addressing
Leane. &ldquo;Men always seem to refuse to admit they are sick until
they&rsquo;re sick enough to make twice as much work for women. Then they
claim they&rsquo;re well too soon, with the same result.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Keeper glanced at Mat and nodded. &ldquo;Yes, Mother,
yet this one cannot claim he is well when he can barely stand up.
At least he has eaten everything on his tray.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be surprised if he had left enough crumbs to
interest a finch. And still hungry, unless I miss my guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could have someone bring him a pie, Mother. Or
some cakes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I think he has had as much as he can hold for
now. If he brings it all back up, it won&rsquo;t do him any good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat scowled. It seemed to him that when you got sick,
you became invisible to women unless they were actually talking to
you. And then they took at least ten years off your age. Nynaeve,
his mother, his sisters, the Amyrlin Seat, they all did it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not hungry at all,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;I am fine. If
you will let me put my clothes on, I&rsquo;ll show you how well I am. I
will be out of here before you know it.&rdquo; They were both looking at
him, now. He cleared his throat. &ldquo;Uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin snorted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve eaten a meal for five,
and you will eat three or four like it every day for days yet, or
else you will starve to death. You&rsquo;ve just been Healed from a link
to the evil that killed every man, woman, and child in Aridhol, and
no less strong for near two thousand years waiting for you to pick
it up. It was killing you just as surely as it killed them. That is
not like having a fish spine stuck in your thumb, boy. We very
nearly killed you ourselves trying to save you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not hungry,&rdquo; he maintained. His stomach growled
loudly to give him the lie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I read you aright the first time I saw you,&rdquo; the
Amyrlin said. &ldquo;I knew right then you&rsquo;d bolt like a startled
fisher-bird if you ever thought someone was trying to hold you. As
well I took precautions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He eyed them warily. &ldquo;Precautions?&rdquo; They looked back,
all serenity. He felt as if their eyes were pinning him to the
bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your name and description are on their way to the
bridge guards,&rdquo; the Amyrlin said, &ldquo;and the dockmasters. I&rsquo;ll not
try to hold you inside the Tower, but you will not leave Tar Valon
until you are well. Should you try to hide in the city, hunger will
drive you back here eventually, or if it doesn&rsquo;t, we will find you
before you starve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you want to keep me here so badly?&rdquo; he
demanded. He heard Selene&rsquo;s voice. <em>They want to use you</em>.
&ldquo;Why should you care whether I starve or not? I can feed
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin gave a small laugh with little amusement
in it. &ldquo;With two silver marks and a handful of copper, my son? Your
dice would need to be very lucky indeed to buy all the food you&rsquo;ll
need in the next few days. We do not Heal people, then let them
waste our efforts by dying while they still need care. In addition
to which, you may yet need more Healing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More? You said you had Healed me. Why should I need
more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My son, you carried that dagger for months. I
believe we dug every trace of it out of you, but if we missed even
the smallest speck, it could still be fatal. And who knows what
effect your having it in your possession so long may have? Half a
year from now, a year, and you may wish you had an Aes Sedai to
hand to Heal you again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want me to stay here a year?&rdquo; he said
incredulously, and loudly. Leane shifted her feet and eyed him
sharply, but the Amyrlin&rsquo;s calm features were unruffled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not so long as that, my son. Long enough to
be certain, though. Surely you want as much. Would you set sail in
a boat when you didn&rsquo;t know whether the caulking would hold, or
whether a plank might be rotten?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never had much to do with boats,&rdquo; Mat muttered. It
might be true. Aes Sedai never lied, but there were too many mights
and mays in it for him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been gone from home a long time,
Mother. My da and my mother probably think I am dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you wish to write a letter to them, I will see
that it is carried to Emond&rsquo;s Field.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat waited for more, but no more came. &lsquo;Thank you,
Mother.&rdquo; He essayed a small laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m half surprised my da did
not come looking for me. He&rsquo;s the kind of man who would.&rdquo; He was
not sure, but he thought there was a small hesitation before the
Amyrlin answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did come. Leane spoke to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Keeper took it up immediately. &ldquo;We did not know
where you were then, Mat. I told him so, and he left before the
heavy snows. I gave him some gold to make the journey home
easier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; the Amyrlin said, &ldquo;he will be pleased to
hear from you. And your mother will, certainly. Give me the letter
when you have written it, and I will see to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had told him, but he had had to ask. <em>And
they didn&rsquo;t mention Rand&rsquo;s da. Maybe because they didn&rsquo;t think I
would care, and maybe because</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Burn me, I don&rsquo;t know.
Who can tell with Aes Sedai?</em> &ldquo;I was traveling with a friend,
Mother. Rand al&rsquo;Thor. You remember him. Do you know if he is all
right? I&rsquo;ll bet his da is worried, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As far as I know,&rdquo; the Amyrlin said smoothly, &ldquo;the
boy is well enough, but who can say? I have seen him only once, the
time I saw you, in Fal Dara.&rdquo; She turned to the Keeper. &ldquo;Perhaps he
could do with a small piece of pie, Leane. And something for his
throat, if he is going to do all this talking. Will you see that it
is brought to him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tall Aes Sedai left with a murmured, &ldquo;As you
command, Mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the Amyrlin turned back to Mat, she was smiling,
but her eyes were blue ice. &ldquo;There are things it would be dangerous
for you to talk about, perhaps even in front of Leane. A flapping
tongue has killed more men than sudden storms ever did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dangerous, Mother?&rdquo; His mouth felt suddenly parched,
but he resisted the urge to lick his lips. <em>Light, how much does
she know about Rand? If only Moiraine didn&rsquo;t keep so many
secrets</em>. &ldquo;Mother, I don&rsquo;t know anything dangerous. I can
hardly remember half of what I do know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember the Horn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What horn is that, Mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was on her feet and looming over him so fast he
hardly saw her move. &ldquo;You play games with me, boy, and I will make
you weep for your mother to come running. I have no time for games,
and neither do you. Now, do&mdash;you&mdash;remember?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clutching the blanket tightly around him, he had to
swallow before he could say, &ldquo;I remember, Mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She seemed to relax, just a little, and Mat shrugged
his shoulders queasily. He felt as if he had just been allowed to
lift them off a chopping block.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good. That is good, Mat.&rdquo; She sat back down slowly,
studying him. &ldquo;Do you know that you are linked to the Horn?&rdquo; He
mouthed the word &ldquo;linked&rdquo; silently, shocked, and she nodded. &ldquo;I did
not think you knew. You were first to blow the Horn of Valere after
it was found. For you, it will summon dead heroes back from the
grave. For anyone else, it is only a horn&mdash;so long as you
live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took a deep breath. &ldquo;So long as I live,&rdquo; he said
in a dull voice, and the Amyrlin nodded. &ldquo;You could have let me
die.&rdquo; She nodded again. &ldquo;Then you could have had anyone you want
blow it, and it would have worked for them.&rdquo; Another nod. &ldquo;Blood
and ashes! You mean me to blow it for you. When the Last Battle
comes, you mean me to call heroes back from the grave to fight the
Dark One for you. Blood and bloody ashes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put an elbow on the arm of the chair and propped
her chin on her hand. Her eyes never left him. &ldquo;Would you prefer
the alternative?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He frowned, then remembered what the alternative was.
If someone else had to sound the Horn&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;You want me to blow
the Horn? Then I&rsquo;ll blow the Horn. I never said I would not, did
I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin gave an exasperated sigh. &ldquo;You remind me
of my uncle Huan. No one could ever pin him down. He liked to
gamble, too, and he&rsquo;d much rather have fun than work. He died
pulling children out of a burning house. He wouldn&rsquo;t stop going
back as long as there was one left inside. Are you like him, Mat?
Will you be there when the flames are high?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He could not meet her eyes. He studied his fingers as
they plucked irritably at his blanket. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no hero. I do what I
have to do, but I am no hero.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most of those we call heroes only did what they had
to do. I suppose it will have to be enough. For now. You must not
speak to anyone but me of the Horn, my son. Or of your link to
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>For now?</em> he thought. <em>It&rsquo;s all you are
going to bloody get, now or ever</em>. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to bloody tell
everybo&mdash;&rdquo; She arched an eyebrow, and he made his voice smooth
again. &ldquo;I do not want to tell anyone. I wish nobody knew. Why do
you want to keep it such a secret? Don&rsquo;t you trust your Aes
Sedai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a long moment he thought he had gone too far. Her
face hardened, and her look could have carved axe handles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I could make it so that only you and I knew,&rdquo; she
said coldly, &ldquo;I would. The more people know a thing, the more the
knowledge spreads, even with the best will. Most of the world
believes the Horn of Valere is only legend, and those who know
better believe one of the Hunters has yet to find it. But Shayol
Ghul knows it has been found, and that means at least some
Darkfriends know. But they do not know where it is, and, if the
Light shines on us, they do not know you sounded it. Do you really
want Darkfriends coming after you? Halfmen, or other Shadowspawn?
They want the Horn. You must know that. It will work as well for
the Shadow as for the Light. But if it is to work for them, they
must take you, or kill you. Do you want to risk that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat wished he had another blanket, and maybe a
goose-down comforter. The room suddenly felt very cold. &ldquo;Are you
telling me Darkfriends could come after me here? I thought the
White Tower could keep Darkfriends out.&rdquo; He remembered what Selene
had said about the Black Ajah, and wondered what the Amyrlin would
say to that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good reason to stay, wouldn&rsquo;t you say?&rdquo; She got to
her feet, smoothing her skirts. &ldquo;Rest, my son. Soon you will feel
much better. Rest.&rdquo; She closed the door softly behind her.</p>

<p>For a long time Mat lay staring up at the ceiling. He
barely noticed when a serving woman came with his piece of pie and
another pitcher of milk, taking the tray of empty dishes when she
went. His stomach rumbled loudly at the warm smell of apples and
spices, but he paid that no mind either. The Amyrlin thought she
held him like a sheep in a pen. And Selene&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Who in the
Light is she? What does she want?</em> Selene had been right about
some things; but the Amyrlin had told him she meant to use him, and
how. In a way. There were too many holes in what she had said to
suit him, too many holes she could slip something deadly through.
The Amyrlin wanted something, and Selene wanted something, and he
was the rope they were tugging between them. He thought he would
rather face Trollocs than be caught between those two.</p>

<p>There had to be a way out of Tar Valon, a way out of
both their grasps. Once he was beyond the river, he could keep out
of Aes Sedai hands, and Selene&rsquo;s, and Darkfriends&rsquo;, too. He was
sure of it. There had to be a way. All he had to do was think about
it from every angle.</p>

<p>The pie grew cold on the table.</p>
