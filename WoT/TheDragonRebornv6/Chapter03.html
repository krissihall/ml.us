<h4><em>News from the Plain</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">D</span>arkness
shrouded part of the crack, for in one place
the tremors had collapsed a part of the wall against the other
side, high up. He stared up at the blackness warily before hurrying
underneath, but the slab of stone seemed to be solidly wedged in
place. The itch had returned to the back of his head, stronger than
before. <em>No, burn me! No!</em> It went away.</p>

<p>When he came out above the camp, the bowl was filled
with odd shadows from the sinking sun. Moiraine was standing
outside her hut, peering up at the crack. He stopped short. She was
a slender, dark-haired woman no taller than his shoulder, and
pretty, with the ageless quality of all Aes Sedai who had worked
with the One Power for a time. He could not put any age at all to
her, with her face too smooth for many years and her dark eyes to
wise for youth. Her dress of deep blue silk was disarrayed and
dusty, and wisps stuck out in her usually well-ordered hair. A
smudge of dust lay across her face.</p>

<p>He dropped his eyes. She knew about him&mdash;she
and Lan alone, of those in the camp&mdash;and he did not like the
knowing in her face when she looked into his eyes. Yellow eyes.
Someday, perhaps, he could bring himself to ask her what she knew.
An Aes Sedai must know more of it than he did. But this was not the
time. There never seemed to be a time. &ldquo;He&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;It was an accident.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An accident,&rdquo; she said in a flat voice, then shook
her head and vanished back inside the hut. The door banged shut a
little loudly.</p>

<p>Perrin drew a deep breath and continued on down
toward the cook fires. There would be another argument between Rand
and the Aes Sedai, in the morning if not tonight.</p>

<p>Half a dozen trees lay toppled on the slopes of the
bowl, roots ripped out of the earth in arcs of soil. A trail of
scrapes and churned ground led down to the streamside and a boulder
that had not been there before. One of the huts up the opposite
slope had collapsed in the tremors, and most of the Shienarans were
gathered around it, rebuilding it. Loial was with them. The Ogier
could pick up a log it would take four men to lift. Uno&rsquo;s curses
occasionally drifted down.</p>

<p>Min stood by the fires, stirring a kettle with a
disgruntled expression. There was a small bruise on her cheek, and
a faint smell of burned stew hung in the air. &ldquo;I hate cooking,&rdquo; she
announced, and peered doubtfully into the kettle. &ldquo;If something
goes wrong with it, it isn&rsquo;t my fault. Rand spilled half of it on
the fire with his&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;What right does he have to bounce us around
like sacks of grain?&rdquo; She rubbed the seat of her breeches and
winced. &ldquo;When I get my hands on him, I&rsquo;ll thump him so he never
forgets.&rdquo; She waved the wooden spoon at Perrin as if she intended
to start the thumping with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was anyone hurt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only if you count bruises,&rdquo; Min said grimly. &ldquo;They
were upset, all right, at first. Then they saw Moiraine staring off
toward Rand&rsquo;s hidey-hole, and decided it was his work. If the <em>
Dragon</em> wants to shake the mountain down on our heads, then the
<em>Dragon</em> must have a good reason for it. If he decided to
make them take off their skins and dance in their bones, they would
think it all right.&rdquo; She snorted and rapped the spoon on the edge
of the kettle.</p>

<p>He looked back toward Moiraine&rsquo;s hut. If Leya had
been hurt&mdash;if she were dead&mdash;the Aes Sedai would not
simply have gone back inside. The sense of waiting was still there.
<em>Whatever it is, it hasn&rsquo;t happened yet</em>. &ldquo;Min, maybe you
had better go. First thing in the morning. I have some silver I can
let you have, and I&rsquo;m sure Moiraine would give you enough to take
passage with a merchant&rsquo;s train out of Ghealdan. You could be back
in Baerlon before you know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him until he began to wonder if he had
said something wrong. Finally, she said, &ldquo;That is very sweet of
you, Perrin. But, no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you wanted to go. You&rsquo;re always carrying
on about having to stay here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew an old Illianer woman, once,&rdquo; she said
slowly. &ldquo;When she was young, her mother arranged a marriage for her
with a man she had never even met. They do that down in Illian,
sometimes. She said she spent the first five years raging against
him, and the next five scheming to make his life miserable without
his knowing who was to blame. It was only years later, she said,
when he died, that she realized he really had been the love of her
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what that has to do with this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her look said he obviously was not trying to
understand, and her voice became overly patient. &ldquo;Just because fate
has chosen something for you instead of you choosing it for
yourself doesn&rsquo;t mean it has to be bad. Even if it&rsquo;s something you
are sure you would never have chosen in a hundred years. &lsquo;Better
ten days of love than years of regretting,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; she quoted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand that even less,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t have to stay if you don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hung the spoon on a tall forked stick stuck in
the ground, then surprised him by rising on tiptoe to kiss his
cheek. &ldquo;You are a very nice man, Perrin Aybara. Even if you don&rsquo;t
understand anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin blinked at her uncertainly. He wished that he
could be certain Rand was in his right mind, or that Mat were
there. He was never sure of his ground with girls, but Rand always
seemed to know his way. So did Mat; most of the girls back home in
Emond&rsquo;s Field had sniffed that Mat would never grow up, but he had
seemed to have a way with them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about you, Perrin? Don&rsquo;t you ever want to go
home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the time,&rdquo; he said fervently. &ldquo;But I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I do
not think I can. Not yet.&rdquo; He looked off toward Rand&rsquo;s vale. <em>We
are tied together, it seems, aren&rsquo;t we, Rand?</em> &ldquo;Maybe not
ever.&rdquo; He thought he had said that too softly for her to hear, but
the look she gave him was full of sympathy. And agreement.</p>

<p>His ears caught faint footsteps behind him, and he
looked back up toward Moiraine&rsquo;s hut. Two shapes were making their
way down through the deepening twilight, one a woman, slender and
graceful even on the rough, slanting ground. The man, head and
shoulders taller than his companion, turned off toward where the
Shienarans were working. Even to Perrin&rsquo;s eyes he was indistinct,
sometimes seeming to vanish altogether, then reappear in midstride,
parts of him fading into the night and fading back as the wind
gusted. Only a Warder&rsquo;s shifting cloak could do that, which made
the larger figure Lan, just as the smaller was certainly
Moiraine.</p>

<p>Well behind them, another shape, even dimmer, slipped
between the trees. <em>Rand</em>, Perrin thought, <em>going back to
his hut. Another night when he won&rsquo;t eat because he can&rsquo;t stand the
way everybody looks at him</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must have eyes in the back of your head,&rdquo; Min
said, frowning toward the approaching woman. &ldquo;Or else the sharpest
ears I have ever heard of. Is that Moiraine?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Careless</em>. He had grown so used to the
Shienarans knowing how well he could see&mdash;in daylight at
least; they did not know about the night&mdash;that he was
beginning to slip about other things. <em>Carelessness might kill
me yet</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the Tuatha&rsquo;an woman all right?&rdquo; Min asked as
Moiraine came to the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is resting.&rdquo; The Aes Sedai&rsquo;s low voice had its
usual musical quality, as if speaking were halfway to singing, and,
her hair and clothes were back in perfect order again. She rubbed
her hands over the fire. There was a golden ring on her left hand,
a serpent biting its own tail. The Great Serpent, an even older
symbol for eternity than the Wheel of Time. Every woman trained in
Tar Valon wore such a ring.</p>

<p>For a moment Moiraine&rsquo;s gaze rested on Perrin, and
seemed to penetrate too deeply. &ldquo;She fell and split her scalp when
Rand&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Her mouth tightened, but in the next instant her face
was utter calm again. &ldquo;I Healed her, and she is sleeping. There is
always a good deal of blood with even a minor scalp wound, but it
was not serious. Did you see anything about her, Min?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min looked uncertain. &ldquo;I saw&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I thought I saw
her death. Her own face, all over blood. I was sure I knew what it
meant, but if she split her scalp&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Are you sure she is all
right?&rdquo; It was a measure of her discomfort that she asked. An Aes
Sedai did not Heal and leave anything wrong that could be Healed.
And Moiraine&rsquo;s Talents were particularly strong in that area.</p>

<p>Min sounded so troubled that Perrin was surprised for
a moment. Then he nodded to himself. She did not really like doing
what she did, but it was a part of her; she thought she knew how it
worked, or some of it, at least. If she was wrong, it would almost
be like finding out she did not know how to use her own hands.</p>

<p>Moiraine considered her for a moment, serene and
dispassionate. &ldquo;You have never been wrong in any reading for me,
not one about which I had any way of knowing. Perhaps this is the
first time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I know, I know,&rdquo; Min whispered obstinately.
&ldquo;Light help me, I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or perhaps it is yet to come. She has a long way yet
to travel, to return to her wagons, and she must ride through
unsettled lands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai&rsquo;s voice was a cool song, uncaring.
Perrin made an involuntary sound in his throat. <em>Light, did I
sound like that? I won&rsquo;t let a death matter that little to
me</em>.</p>

<p>As if he had spoken aloud, Moiraine looked at him.
&ldquo;The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills, Perrin. I told you long ago
that we were in a war. We cannot stop just because some of us may
die. Any of us may die before it is done. Leya&rsquo;s weapons may not be
the same as yours, but she knew that when she became part of
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin dropped his eyes. <em>That&rsquo;s as may be, Aes
Sedai, but I will never accept it the way you do</em>.</p>

<p>Lan joined them across the fire, with Uno and Loial.
The flames cast flickering shadows across the Warder&rsquo;s face, making
it seem more carved from stone even than it normally did, all hard
planes and angles. His cloak was not much easier to look at in the
firelight. Sometimes it seemed only a dark gray cloak, or black,
but the gray and black appeared to crawl and change if you looked
too closely, shades and shadows sliding across it, soaking into it.
Other times, it looked as if Lan had somehow made a hole in the
night and pulled darkness &rsquo;round his shoulders. Not at all an easy
thing to watch, and not made any easier by the man who wore it.</p>

<p>Lan was tall and hard, broad-shouldered, with blue
eyes like frozen mountain lakes, and he moved with a deadly grace
that made the sword on his hip seem a part of him. It was not that
he seemed merely capable of violence and death; this man had tamed
violence and death and kept them in his pocket, ready to be loosed
in a heartbeat, or embraced, should Moiraine give the word. Beside
Lan, even Uno appeared less dangerous. There was a touch of gray in
the Warder&rsquo;s long hair, held back by a woven leather cord around
his forehead, but younger men stepped back from confronting Lan&mdash;if they were wise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mistress Leya has the usual news from Almoth Plain,&rdquo;
Moiraine said. &ldquo;Everyone fighting everyone else. Villages burned.
People fleeing in every direction. And Hunters have appeared on the
plain, searching for the Horn of Valere.&rdquo; Perrin shifted&mdash;the
Horn was where no Hunter on Almoth Plain would find it; where he
hoped no Hunter ever would find it&mdash;and she gave him a cool
look before continuing. She did not like any of them to speak of
the Horn. Except when she chose to, of course.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She brought different news, as well. The Whitecloaks
have perhaps five thousand men on Almoth Plain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uno grunted. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s flamin&rsquo;&mdash;uh, pardon, Aes
Sedai. That must be half their strength. They&rsquo;ve never committed so
much to one place before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I suppose all those who declared for Rand are
dead or scattered,&rdquo; Perrin muttered. &ldquo;Or they soon will be. You
were right, Moiraine.&rdquo; He did not like the thought of Whitecloaks.
He did not like the Children of the Light at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is what is odd,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;Or the first
part of it. The Children have announced that their purpose is to
bring peace, which is not unusual for them. What is unusual is that
while they are trying to force the Taraboners and the Domani back
across their respective borders, they have not moved in any force
against those who have declared for the Dragon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min gave an exclamation of surprise. &ldquo;Is she certain?
That does not sound like any Whitecloaks I ever heard of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There can&rsquo;t be many blood&mdash;uh&mdash;many
Tinkers left on the plain,&rdquo; Uno said. His voice creaked from the
strain of watching his language in front of an Aes Sedai. His real
eye matched the frown of the painted one. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t like to stay
where there&rsquo;s any kind of trouble, especially fighting. There can&rsquo;t
be enough of them to see everywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are enough for my purposes,&rdquo; Moiraine said
firmly. &ldquo;Most have gone, but some few remained because I asked them
to. And Leya is quite certain. Oh, the Children have snapped up
some of the Dragonsworn, where there were only a handful gathered.
But though they proclaim they will bring down this <em>false</em>
Dragon, though they have a thousand men supposedly doing nothing
but hunting him, they avoid contact with any party of as many as
fifty Dragonsworn. Not openly, you understand, but there is always
some delay, something that allows those they chase to slip
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Rand can go down to them as he wants.&rdquo; Loial
blinked uncertainly at the Aes Sedai. The whole camp knew of her
arguments with Rand. &ldquo;The Wheel weaves a way for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uno and Lan opened their mouths at the same time, but
the Shienaran gave way with a small bow. &ldquo;More likely,&rdquo; the Warder
said, &ldquo;it is some Whitecloak plot, though the Light burn me if I
can see what it is. But when the Whitecloaks give me a gift, I
search for the poisoned needle hidden in it.&rdquo; Uno nodded grimly.
&ldquo;Besides which,&rdquo; Lan added, &ldquo;the Domani and the Taraboners are
still trying as hard to kill the Dragonsworn as they are to kill
each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And there is another thing,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;Three
young men have died in villages Mistress Leya&rsquo;s wagons passed
near.&rdquo; Perrin noticed a flicker of Lan&rsquo;s eyelid; for the Warder, it
was as much a sign of surprise as a shout from another man. Lan had
not expected her to tell this. Moiraine went on. &ldquo;One died by
poison, two by the knife. Each in circumstances where no one should
have been able to come close unseen, but that is how it happened.&rdquo;
She peered into the flames. &ldquo;All three young men were taller than
most, and had light-colored eyes. Light eyes are uncommon on Almoth
Plain, but I think it is very unlucky right now to be a tall young
man with light eyes there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; Perrin asked. &ldquo;How could they be killed if no
one could get close to them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Dark One has killers you don&rsquo;t notice until it
is too late,&rdquo; Lan said quietly.</p>

<p>Uno gave a shiver. &ldquo;The Soulless. I never heard of
one south of the Borderlands before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough of such talk,&rdquo; Moiraine said firmly.</p>

<p>Perrin had questions&mdash;<em>What in the Light are
the Soulless? Are they like a Trolloc, or a Fade? What?</em>&mdash;but he left them unasked. When Moiraine decided enough had been
said about something, she would not talk of it anymore. And when
she shut her mouth, you could not pry Lan&rsquo;s open with an iron bar.
The Shienarans followed her lead, too. No one wanted to anger an
Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light!&rdquo; Min muttered, uneasily eyeing the deepening
darkness around them. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t <em>notice</em> them? Light!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So nothing has changed,&rdquo; Perrin said glumly. &ldquo;Not
really. We cannot go down to the plain, and the Dark One wants us
dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything changes,&rdquo; Moiraine said calmly, &ldquo;and the
Pattern takes it all in. We must ride on the Pattern, not on the
changes of a moment.&rdquo; She looked at them each in turn, then said,
&ldquo;Uno, are you certain your scouts missed nothing suspicious? Even
something small?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Lord Dragon&rsquo;s Rebirth has loosed the bonds of
certainty, Moiraine Sedai, and there is never certainty if you
fight Myrddraal, but I will stake my life that the scouts did as
good a job as any Warder.&rdquo; It was one of the longest speeches
Perrin had ever heard out of Uno without any curses. There was
sweat on the man&rsquo;s forehead from the effort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We all may,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;What Rand did might as
well have been a fire on the mountaintop for any Myrddraal within
ten miles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Min began hesitantly. &ldquo;Maybe you ought
to set wards that will keep them out.&rdquo; Lan gave her a hard stare.
He sometimes questioned Moiraine&rsquo;s decisions himself, though he
seldom did so where anyone could overhear, but he did not approve
of others doing the same. Min frowned right back at him. &ldquo;Well,
Myrddraal and Trollocs are bad enough, but at least I can see them.
I don&rsquo;t like the idea that one of these&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;these Soulless might
sneak in here and slit my throat before I even noticed him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wards I set will hide us from the Soulless as
well as from any other Shadowspawn,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;When you are
weak, as we are, the best choice is often to hide. If there it a
Halfman close enough to have&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Well, to set wards that would
kill them if they tried to enter camp is beyond my abilities, and
even if I could, such a warding would only pen us here. Since it is
not possible to set two kinds of warding at once, I leave the
scouts and the guards&mdash;and Lan&mdash;to defend us, and use
the one warding that may do some good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could make a circuit around the camp,&rdquo; Lan said.
&ldquo;If there is anything out there that the scouts missed, I will find
it.&rdquo; It was not a boast, just a statement of fact. Uno even nodded
agreement.</p>

<p>Moiraine shook her head. &ldquo;If you are needed tonight,
my Gaidin, it will be here.&rdquo; Her gaze rose toward the dark
mountains around them. &ldquo;There is a feeling in the air.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Waiting.&rdquo; The word left Perrin&rsquo;s tongue before he
could stop it. When Moiraine looked at him&mdash;into him&mdash;he wished he had it back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Waiting. Make sure your guards are
especially alert tonight, Uno.&rdquo; There was no need to suggest that
the men sleep with their weapons close at hand; Shienarans always
did that. &ldquo;Sleep well,&rdquo; she added to them all, as if there were any
chance of that now, and started back for her hut. Lan stayed long
enough to spoon up three dishes of stew, then hurried after her,
quickly swallowed by the night.</p>

<p>Perrin&rsquo;s eyes shone golden as they followed the
Warder through the darkness. &ldquo;Sleep well,&rdquo; he muttered. The smell
of cooked meat suddenly made him queasy. &ldquo;I have the third watch,
Uno?&rdquo; The Shienaran nodded. &ldquo;Then I will try to take her advice.&rdquo;
Others were coming to the fires, and murmurs of conversation
followed him up the slope.</p>

<p>He had a hut to himself, a small thing of logs barely
tall enough to stand in, the chinks filled with dried mud. A rough
bed, padded with pine boughs beneath a blanket, took up nearly half
of it. Whoever had unsaddled his horse had also propped his bow
just inside the door. He hung up his belt, with axe and quiver, on
a peg, then stripped down to his smallclothes, shivering. The
nights were cold still, but cold kept him from sleeping too deeply.
In deep sleep, dreams came that he could not shake off.</p>

<p>For a time, with a single blanket over him, he lay
staring at the log roof, shivering. Then sleep came, and with it,
dreams.</p>
