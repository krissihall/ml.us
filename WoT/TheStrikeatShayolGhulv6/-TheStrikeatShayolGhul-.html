<h2>The Strike at Shayol Ghul</h2>
<h4><em>Prequel to The Wheel of Time</em></h4>
<h4><em>Robert Jordan</em></h4>

<h4><em>Foreword by Robert Jordan</em></h4>

<p>Sometimes fans ask me whether I
mean to write prequels to <em>The Wheel of
Time</em>. While some requests are for books about The Trolloc Wars or the rise
and fall of the High King, Artur Hawking, or the life histories of various
characters, the most frequent are for books about the AOL and its end in the
War of the Power, and the most often asked question is, I believe, &ldquo;Why,
when the greatest feats of the Age of Legends were done by men and women
working together with the One Power, was the final attack on Shayol Ghul
carried out by men alone?&rdquo; At present I do not intend to write any of
those books, but I won&rsquo;t say that a story or two might not creep out
eventually. I do not normally do short fiction. My editor claims that for me, a
short story means fifty thousand words. As for the question, though&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I hope
that those fans (and the rest of you) will be satisfied for the time with what
follows, a fictional bit of &ldquo;non-fiction,&rdquo; a piece from an Age called
the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">O</span>
ne of the most important finds of
recent years, perhaps since the Breaking, is a partial copy of no less than a
history of the world from the drilling of the Bore into the Dark One&rsquo;s Prison
to the End of the Breaking of the world. The original apparently dated from
early in the First Century A.B. Despite the extreme paucity of material from
the entire first millennium after the Breaking, we can only be thankful that
the art of printing survived the Breaking of the World when so much else did
not, and was indeed practiced to some extent during the Breaking itself, though
under severe and restricted conditions. Considering the widespread destruction
of The Trolloc Wars and the War of the Hundred Years, which although far less
than the near totality of the Breaking still saw cities, nations, and far
worse, knowledge, go to the fires, we must marvel at any writing that has
survived more than three thousand years. What we know is based on fragments,
copied and recopied a thousand times, but at least we know something from them.
Even a little knowledge is better than ignorance. </p>

<p><a name="back1"></a>Discovered in a dusty storage room
in Chachin, the pages were in a chest full of old bills and receipts, students&rsquo;
copy books and private diaries, some so foxed by age and with ink so faded as
to be unreadable where the pages themselves had not crumbled. The fragmentary
manuscript was readable, barely, but presented the usual problems, quite aside
from the difficulties of translation and dealing with centuries of copyists&rsquo;
errors; such a history would no doubt be a vast, multi-volume work (please see
the author&rsquo;s <a class="body" href="#note">Note</a> at the end), yet of the two hundred and
twelve surviving pages, the largest number of consecutive pages number six, and
nowhere else more than two. Such dates as are given are totally
incomprehensible, as no calendar dating from the Age of Legends has ever been
found. Many references to cataclysmic events (dire battles and cities destroyed
by balefire during the War of the Shadow, whole regions covered by the sea and
mountain ranges raised overnight during the Breaking) and to such minutiae as
the appearance of a certain person are but curiosities. The pages which might
reveal exactly where these things happened, what their special significance
was, the resolution or end result, are usually missing. Why then is this
collection so important? First because, sundered as it is, it contains more
information of the War of the Shadow than any other known single source,
perhaps as much as all other sources combined in some ways. But even more importantly,
it gives a great deal of information available nowhere else. And most
importantly of all, the six consecutive pages and others which must be placed
close to them contain the only known account of events surrounding what surely
must be the most far-reaching single event in the history of the world, in any
Age: the sealing of the Bore by Lews Therin Telamon and the Hundred Companions.</p>

<p>We still cannot be certain how
long passed between the creation of the Bore and the actual beginning of what
would come to be called the War of the Shadow, yet plainly at least fifty years
and possibly more than one hundred were marked by a rapid decline in the social
order and an equally rapid increase in a thousand ills that previously had been
either rare or entirely unknown. War itself was a &ldquo;new&rdquo; discovery, it
seems, though one quickly learned, some might even say perfected. The War of
the Shadow tilted one way, then another, in fire and blood, over its course.
During the first three years, the Shadow made great gains, and large parts of
the world fell beneath the horror of the Dark One&rsquo;s dominion, however
indirectly through human representatives. And surely, the presence of Myrddraal
and Trollocs cannot be called indirect. Under the leadership of Lews Therin Telamon,
the legendary Dragon of the Prophecies, much of what had been lost was retaken
over the next four years, though not without reverses. At that point, a
stalemate developed, and for nearly a year neither side was able to effect any
gain despite fierce fighting, but when the stalemate broke, the Shadow began to
advance again, slowly at first but with ever increasing speed. According to the
writer of that fragmentary history, &ldquo;It was as if every step forward by
the Shadow scattered the spores of chaos before it, and feeding on what grew,
the Shadow gained strength, so that its next stride was longer, and the next
step would be longer still.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Huge areas had been devastated to
varying degrees by this time as the war surged back and forth around the world,
and it was obvious that while the Shadow was willing to starve or murder a
great percentage of the population in the conquered territories, the forces of
the Light could no longer sustain a protracted war. They were losing, being
pushed toward inevitable defeat with increasing speed, and if they were to win
at all, it must be done quickly.</p>

<p>One of the plans for ending the
war quickly, proposed by Lews Therin, centered around a direct attack on the
Bore itself. Seven &ldquo;focus points&rdquo; (there seems no better translation
from the old tongue, although they are obviously the Seals of Legend) were
constructed of <em>cuendillar</em>. A raiding force&mdash;so they called it,
though even in the light of recent past events it must still seem a large army
to most people of this day&mdash;a raiding force consisting of some twenty
thousand soldiers to provide security and a circle of seven female Aes Sedai
and six male (the minimum number believed necessary, and all the strongest who
could be found) would Travel to Shayol Ghul, the one place on earth where what
has been called &ldquo;a thinness in the Pattern&rdquo; makes the Bore
detectable, and there to implant seals held by the focus points which would
close up the Bore and shut the Dark One from the world once more.</p>

<p>This plan was considered risky for
a number of reasons. Even today it is known that the Dark One has a certain
degree of effect on the world close around Shayol Ghul, and it was probable
that any attempt to channel there would be instantly detected and the raiding
party destroyed. Lews Therin himself, who intended to personally lead this huge
raid, admitted that even with sucess, he expected few of the attackers to
survive, perhaps none. Worse, several experts claimed that if the seals were
not placed with exact precision, the resulting strain would, instead of sealing
up the Bore, rip it open, freeing the Dark One completely. </p>

<p>Another plan at the time centered
around two huge <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>, one attuned to <em>saidin</em> and one to <em>saidar</em>,
both so powerful that using them required special <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, like
miniature versions of the great <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>, constructed especially for
the purpose of accessing the <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>. This project had its
detractors, too, for the <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em> were planned to be so powerful
that either one might well provide enough of the One Power to destroy the
world, while both together certainly would. Some doubted that so much of the
One Power could be handled safely under the circumstances. Against that was the
certainty, according to the plan&rsquo;s supporters, that used together they would provide
sufficient Power to drive the Shadow&rsquo;s forces back, to defeat them completely
and erect a barrier around Shayol Ghul until a safe method of dealing with the
Bore was assured. </p>

<p>Detractors pointed out that the
Bore had enlarged since it was first drilled, and behind the barricade erected
by the <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em> it would continue to grow, so that eventually the
Dark One might free himself within the barrier. The barrier might well contain
the Dark One when all he could do was reach through the relatively small Bore,
but could it hold back the Dark One let loose?</p>

<p>The hall of the Servants quickly
divided into two camps, and those who favored one plan derided the other.</p>

<p><a name="back2"></a>Support for the use of the great <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>
and opposition to attempting to implant the seals centered around a woman named
Latra Posae Decume. Apparently a speaker of considerable force and persuasion,
she gathered a large bloc around her, but what assured her victory was an
agreement she reached with every female Aes Sedai of significant strength on
the side of the Light. (In the manuscript, this agreement is called &ldquo;the
Fateful Concord,&rdquo; though it was doubtful that this was the name it was
generally known.) Lews Therin&rsquo;s plan was too rash, too dangerous, and no woman
who agreed to the Concord would take part in it. As precise placement of the
seals was widely thought to require a circle, that apparently killed the plan,
since men cannot create a circle, but can only be brought into one created by
women. Work on the <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>, in the form of two huge statues, was
rushed forward. (<a class="body" href="#note1">1</a>)</p>

<p>Just as the paired <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>
were completed, disaster struck. The access <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> were being
made at a place far removed from the <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em> (apparently because of
a danger of &ldquo;uncontrolled resonances during the final stages,&rdquo;
whatever that means), and that region was overrun by forces under Sammael. The
only good point in it was that the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> themselves had been
hidden and the place where they were made destroyed (its very existence had
been a secret at the highest levels all along) so that neither Sammael nor
anyone else for the Shadow knew that any of these things were now within their
grasp. The side of the Light still had the <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>, but no safe way
to access them; without the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> it was certain that even the
strongest Aes Sedai would be burned out instantly by the huge flow of the One
Power.</p>

<p><a name="back3"></a>Lews Therin argued again for his
plan, acknowledging the risks but saying that was now the only chance, yet
Posae maintained her opposition. Belief in the danger of misplacing the seals
had spread, and many more female Aes Sedai had pledged to the &ldquo;Fateful
Concord,&rdquo; including a great number who were nowhere near strong enough to
qualify for the raiding party circle. Tempers and passions rose, and an
apparently unprecedented division along male-female lines began to develop
among the Aes Sedai in general, if not within the Hall itself. Finally the Hall
decided to continue with Latra Posae&rsquo;s plan, and her people began working to
smuggle the access <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> out of Shadow-controlled territory. (<a class="body"
href="#note2">2</a>)</p>

<p><a name="back4"></a>Almost immediately on the heels of
Sammael&rsquo;s advance, armies commanded by Demandred and Bel&rsquo;al struck heavily. At
this point in the war, halting an advance by the Shadow was the best that could
be hoped for; no conquered territory had been regained in the past two years.
In intense and bloody fighting, these two drives were barely contained, but
Demandred and Bel&rsquo;al kept the pressure on. Sammael began a new offensive, also
scarcely held, and there is mention of heavy military activity elsewhere.
Apparently both of the great <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em> were threatened by these
offensives; in fact, it was possible that they were the target. Massive riots
swept a number of cities still held by the Light and the &ldquo;re-emergence of
the peace faction&rdquo; is mentioned, apparently a group demanding negotiations
with the Forsaken. (<a class="body" href="#note3">3</a>) The final defeat was at hand; the
will of the people to resist was fading, and should any one of the three major
offensives commanded by Forsaken break through the end would be only a matter
of time, perhaps as little as months. With Latra Posae&rsquo;s opposition continuing
in the face of these events (<a class="body" href="#note4">4</a>), and the female Aes Sedai
holding to their pledge and thus making use of a circle impossible (the lines
of division had hardened to a point where many female Aes Sedai refused to
speak to male Aes Sedai, and the reverse as well), Lews Therin resolved to
carry out his plan without the approval of, or even approaching, the Hall.
Plainly it was going to be impossible to hold the huge <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em> long
enough for the access <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> to be smuggled out. In Lews Therin&rsquo;s
view, there was no longer any choice.</p>

<p>A group of powerful young male Aes
Sedai, vocal in their arguements (apparently to the point of several times
disrupting meetings of the Hall), had formed in support of Lews Therin during
the struggle with Latra Posae, a group popularly called the Hundred Companions,
though in actuality they numbered one hundred and thirteen at this point. As
the highest military leader for the Light, Lews Therin was able to assemble a
force of some ten thousand soldiers unbeknownst to the Hall. With that force
and the Hundred Companions, he launched his planned attack at Shayol Ghul.</p>

<p>Exactly what occured that day can
never be known, only the results. Of the soldiers, not a single man or woman
returned to give any account. The seals were placed safely, without ripping
open the Dark One&rsquo;s prison as many opponents had feared. By chance, all
thirteen of the Forsaken were at Shayol Ghul (perhaps summonded for a
conference with the Dark One?), and they were trapped in the sealing, thus
decapitating at one stroke the Shadow&rsquo;s leadership. Though most of the world
was held for the Shadow, if that had been the whole result it is certain that
over the next few years the Shadow would have been extinguished all across the
face of the earth. Civilization had retained a large degree of cohesion in the
areas held by the Light, far more so than in those held by the Shadow. Deprived
of their highest levels (and also perhaps because of the loss of the Dark One&rsquo;s
infuence) the Shadowsworn fell into struggles among themselves for power,
dividing into warring, vulnerable well before the Breaking progressed to a
point that made the war the least of anyone&rsquo;s concerns. In any case, the War of
the Shadow must be said to have ended that day at Shayol Ghul. So it is
generally recorded.</p>

<p>But that was not the only result,
of course. Instead, there was the counterstroke from the Dark One at the moment
of sealing, and <em>saidin</em> itself was tainted. Lews Therin and the
sixty-eight survivors of the Hundred Companions went insane on the instant.
Within days they were leaving trails of death and destruction in their paths.
By the time the taint on <em>saidin</em> was discovered, hundreds more male Aes
Sedai had been driven mad, and what remained of civilization after the war
itself had fallen into chaos. Even informing all the remaining sane male Aes Sedai
of the danger was now impossible. That fateful day at Shayol Ghul ended the
war, and began the Breaking of the World.</p>

<p>The most suitable comment surely
comes from what appears to be the introduction of the fragmentary manuscript.
&ldquo;Whoever read this, if any remain to read it, weep for us who have no more
tears. Pray for us who are damned alive.&rdquo;</p>

<h4><em>End Notes</em></h4>

<a name="note1"></a>
 <p class="drop"><b>(1)</b> Speculation of the
     wilder sort is rife among some who call themselves historians, and the
     discovery of this material has resulted in the expected from the usual
     quarters. Would the great <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em> have proven effective used
     as Patra Posae desired? Had the seals been placed by a circle comprised of
     men and women together, might the men, or even <em>saidin</em> itself,
     have been protected in some fasion from the Dark One&rsquo;s counter stroke? Or
     would <em>saidar</em> have been tainted as well? The last possibility is
     enough to curdle the coldest blood, yet the fact is that events transpired
     as they transpired, and such speculation is no more than a fireside game
     to frighten the gullible. Those I speak of will know who I mean. <span class="nav"><a href="#back2">Back</a></span></p>
<a name="note2"></a>
 <p class="drop"><b>(2)</b> According to the
     manuscript pages, all of the agents responsible for this smuggling were
     caught, though that was not known until events had far outrun anyone&rsquo;s
     plans. They were brave men and women, for although those who were not
     killed outright were tortured, and though some revealed the purpose of
     their mission, none betrayed the location of any of the access <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>.
     Still, the only real result was that the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> were widely
     scattered across areas held for the Shadow, their locations and even their
     existence to remain hidden for millennia. <span class="nav"><a href="#back3">Back</a></span></p>
<a name="note3"></a>
<p class="drop"><b>(3)</b> The manuscript
     indicates that there were several peace factions during the course of the
     war. Or perhaps only one, with fortunes that waxed and waned. It is clear
     that several times during the war this group sent parties at its own
     initiative to the Forsaken seeking a negotiated settlement, and that upon
     returning, members of each of these delegations were later discovered
     carrying out activities that aided the Shadow&rsquo;s cause, though it seems
     that in some instances, they were completely unaware of what they had
     done. It is a wonder that those people did not remember a saying that is
     supposed to have originated during the War of the Shadow. &ldquo;There is
     never peace with the Shadow.&rdquo; <span class="nav"><a href="#back4">Back</a></span></p>
<a name="note4"></a>
<p class="drop"><b>(4)</b> Before her death
     during the Breaking (which cannot be specified from the evidence of the
     manuscript, unfortunately either as to time or place), Latra Posae
     apparently rose to a prominence which rivaled that of Lews Therin before
     her. During the fighting aginst the Shadowsworn before the Breaking put an
     end to what by that time seemed inconsequential by comparison, she gained
     the name Shadar Nor, best translated as &ldquo;Cutter of the Shadow&rdquo;
     or perhaps &ldquo;Slicer of the Shadow&rdquo; (the difficulties of precise
     translation from the Old Tongue, with all its multiple meanings, will
     always remain with us). It is thus ironic that no other document yet
     discovered so much as mentions her name or acomplishments. Perhaps this
     will serve to restore Latra Posae Decume to her proper place in history. <span class="nav"><a href="#back4">Back</a></span></p>
