<h4><em>Gathering Darkness</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he evening sun was a ball of blood on the treetops,
 casting a lurid light across the camp, a widely spaced sprawl of horselines
 and canvas-covered wagons and high-wheeled carts and tents in every size and
 sort with the snow between trampled to slush. Not the time of day or sort of
 place that Elenia wished to be on horseback. The smell of boiling beef
 wafting from the big black iron cookpots was enough to turn her stomach. The
 cold air frosted her breath and promised a bitter night to come, and the wind
 cut through her best red cloak without regard for the thick lining of plush
 white fur. Snowfox was supposed to be warmer than other furs, but she had
 never found it so.</p>

<p>Holding the cloak closed with one gloved hand, she
rode slowly and tried very hard, if not very successfully, not to shiver. Given
the hour, it seemed more than likely she would be spending the night here, but
as yet, she had no idea where she would sleep. Doubtless in some lesser noble&rsquo;s
tent, with the lord or lady shuffled off to find haven elsewhere and trying to
put the best face on being evicted, but Arymilla liked leaving her on
tenterhooks until the very last, about beds and everything else. One suspense
was no sooner dispelled than another replaced it. Plainly the woman thought the
constant uncertainty would make her squirm, perhaps even strive to please. That
was far from the only miscalculation Arymilla had made, beginning with the
belief that Elenia Sarand&rsquo;s claws had been clipped.</p>

<p>She had just four men with the two Golden Boars on their cloaks as
escort&mdash;and her maid, Janny, of course, huddling in her cloak till she seemed
a bundle of green wool piled on her saddle&mdash;and she had not seen a single
fellow more in the camp who she could be sure held a scrap of loyalty to Sarand.
Here and there one of the clumps of men huddled around the campfires with their
laundresses and seamstresses displayed House Anshar&rsquo;s Red Fox, and a double
column of horsemen wearing Baryn&rsquo;s Winged Hammer passed her heading in the
opposite direction at a slow walk, hard-faced behind the bars of their helmets.
They were of little real account, in the long run. Karind and Lir had gotten
singed badly by being slow when Morgase took the throne. This time they would
take Anshar and Baryn wherever the advantage lay the instant they saw it
clearly, abandoning Arymilla with as great an alacrity as they had leapt to
join her. When the time came.</p>

<p>Most of the men trudging through the muddy slush or
peering hopefully into those disgusting cookpots were levies, farmers and
villagers gathered up when their lord or lady marched, and few wore any sort of
House badge on their shabby coats and patched cloaks. Even separating putative
soldiers from farriers and fletchers and the like was near impossible, since
nearly all had belted on a sword of some description, or an axe. Light, a fair
number of the <em>women</em> wore knives large enough to be called short-swords,
but there was no way to tell some conscripted farmer&rsquo;s wife from a wagon
driver. They wore the same thick wool and had the same rough hands and weary
faces. It did not really matter, in any case. This winter siege was a dire
mistake&mdash;the armsmen would begin going hungry long before the city did&mdash;but
it gave Elenia an opportunity, and when an opening presented itself, you
struck. Keeping her hood back far enough to show her features clearly in spite
of the freezing wind, she nodded graciously to every unwashed lout who so much
as looked in her direction, and ignored the surprised starts that some gave at
her condescension.</p>

<p>Most would remember her affability, remember the
Golden Boars her escort wore, and know that Elenia Sarand had
taken notice of them. On such a foundation power was built. A High Seat as much
as a queen stood atop a tower built of people. True, those at the bottom were
bricks of the basest clay, yet if those common bricks crumpled in their
support, the tower fell. That was something Arymilla appeared to have
forgotten, if she had ever known. Elenia doubted that Arymilla spoke to anyone
lower than a steward or a personal servant. Had it been&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;prudent&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she
herself would have passed a few words at every campfire, perhaps grasping a
grubby hand now and then, remembering people she had encountered before or at
least dissembling well enough to make it seem she did. Pure and simple,
Arymilla lacked the wit to be queen.</p>

<p>The
camp covered more ground than most towns, more like a hundred clustered camps
of varying sizes than one, so she was free to wander without worrying too much
about straying close to the outer boundaries, but she took a care anyway. The
guards on sentry would be polite, unless they were utter fools, yet without any
doubt they had their orders. On principle, she approved of people doing as they
were told, but it would be best to avoid any embarrassing incidents.
Especially given the likely consequences if Arymilla actually thought she had
been trying to leave. She had already been forced to endure one frigid night
sleeping in some soldier&rsquo;s filthy tent, a shelter hardly worth the name, complete
with vermin and badly patched holes, not to mention the lack of Janny to help
her with her clothes and add a little warmth under the sorry excuse for
blankets, and that had been for no more than a perceived slight. Well, it had
been an actual slight, but she had not thought Arymilla bright enough to catch
it. Light, to think that <em>she</em> must step warily around that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that
pea-brained ninny! Pulling her cloak closer, she tried to pretend that her
shudder was just a reaction to the wind. There were better things to dwell on.
More important things. She nodded to a wide-eyed young man with a dark scarf
wrapped around his head, and he recoiled as though she had glared. Fool
peasant!</p>

<p>It
was grating to think that, only a few miles away, that young chit Elayne sat
snug and warm in the comfort of the Royal Palace, attended by scores of
well-trained servants and likely without two thoughts in her head beyond what to wear tonight at a supper prepared
by the palace cooks. Rumor had the girl with child, possibly by some Guardsman.
It might be so. Elayne had never possessed any more sense of decency than her
mother. Dyelin was the brain there, a sharp mind and dangerous notwithstanding
her pathetic lack of ambition, perhaps advised by an Aes Sedai. There must be at
least one real Aes Sedai among all those absurd rumors.</p>

<p>So many fabulations drifted out of the city that telling reality from
nonsense became difficult&mdash;Sea Folk making holes in the <em>air?</em> Absolute
drivel!&mdash;yet the White Tower clearly had an interest in putting one of its own
on the throne. How could it not? Even so, Tar Valon seemed to be pragmatic when
it came to these matters. History clearly showed that whoever reached the Lion
Throne would soon find that she was the one the Tower actually had favored all
along. The Aes Sedai would not lose their connection to Andor through a lack of
nimbleness, particularly not with the Tower itself riven. Elenia was as certain
of that as she was of her own name. In fact, if half what she heard of the
Tower&rsquo;s situation was true, the next Queen of Andor might find herself able to
demand whatever she wanted in return for keeping that connection intact. In any
event, no one was going to rest the Rose Crown on her head before summer at the
earliest, and a great deal could change before then. A very great deal.</p>

<p>She was making her second round of the camp when the
sight of another small mounted party ahead of her, picking its slow way between
the scattered campfires in the last light, made her scowl and draw rein
sharply. The women were cloaked and deeply hooded, one in strong blue silk
lined with black fur, the other in plain gray wool, but the silver Triple Keys
worked large on the four armsmen&rsquo;s cloaks named them clearly enough. She could
think of any number of people she would rather encounter than Naean Arawn. In
any case, while Arymilla had not precisely forbidden them to meet without her&mdash;Elenia heard her teeth grind as much as felt them, and forced her face smooth&mdash;for the moment, it seemed wisest not to press matters. Especially when there
seemed no possible advantage to such a meeting.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Naean saw her before she could turn
aside. The woman spoke hastily to her escort and, while armsmen and maid were
still bowing in their saddles, spurred toward Elenia at a pace that sent clods
of slush flying from her black gelding&rsquo;s hooves. The Light <em>burn</em> the
fool! On the other hand, whatever was goading Naean to recklessness might be
valuable to know, and dangerous not to. It might, but finding out presented its
own dangers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay here
and remember that you&rsquo;ve seen nothing,&rdquo; Elenia snapped at her own meager
retinue and dug her heels into Dawn Wind&rsquo;s flanks without waiting for any
reply. She had no need for elaborate bows and courtesies every time she turned
around, not beyond what seemliness demanded, and her people knew better than to
do anything other than what she commanded. It was everyone else she had to
worry about, burn them all! As the long-legged bay sprang forward, she lost her
grip on her cloak, and it streamed behind her like the crimson banner of
Sarand. She refused to gather the cloak under control, flailing around in front
of farmers and the Light alone knew who, so the wind razored through her riding
dress, another reason for irritation.</p>

<p>Naean
at least had the sense to slow and meet her little more than halfway, beside a
pair of heavily laden carts with their empty shafts lying in the muck. The
nearest fire was almost twenty paces away, and the nearest tents farther, their
entry flaps laced tight against the cold. The men at the fire were intent on
the big iron pot steaming over the flames, and if the stench from it was enough
to make Elenia want to empty her stomach, at least the wind that carried the
stink would keep stray words from their ears. But they had better be important
words.</p>

<p>With
a face as pale as ivory in its frame of black fur, Naean might have been called
beautiful by some despite more than a hint of harshness around her mouth and
eyes as cold as blue ice. Straight-backed and outwardly quite calm, she seemed
untouched by events. Her breath, making a white mist, was steady and even. &ldquo;Do
you know where we are sleeping tonight, Elenia?&rdquo; she said coolly.</p>

<p>Elenia
made no effort at all to stop from glaring. &ldquo;Is <em>that</em> what you want?&rdquo;
Risking Arymilla&rsquo;s displeasure for a brainless question! The thought of risking
Arymilla&rsquo;s displeasure, the thought that Arymilla&rsquo;s displeasure was something
she needed to avoid, made her snarl. &ldquo;You know as much as I, Naean.&rdquo; Tugging at
her reins, she was already turning her
mount away when Naean spoke again, with just a hint of heat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play the simpleton with me, Elenia. And don&rsquo;t
tell me you aren&rsquo;t as ready as I am to chew off your own foot to escape this
trap. Now, can we at least pretend to civility?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elenia kept Dawn Wind half turned away from the other
woman and looked at her sideways, past the fur-trimmed edge of her hood. That
way, she could keep an eye on the men crowding around the nearest fire, too. No
House badges displayed there. They could belong to anyone. Now and then one
fellow or another shielding bare hands in his armpits glanced toward the two
ladies on horseback, but their real interest was on shuffling near enough the
fire to get warm. That, and how long it was going to take for the beef to boil
down to something approaching mush. That sort seemed able to eat anything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think you <em>can</em> escape?&rdquo; she asked quietly. Civility was
all very well, but not at the expense of remaining here for all to see any
longer than absolutely necessary. If Naean saw a way out, though&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;How?
The pledge you signed to support Marne has been posted across half of Andor by
now. Besides, you can hardly think Arymilla will just allow you to ride away.&rdquo;
Naean flinched, and Elenia could not help a tight smile. The woman was not so
untouched as she feigned. She still managed to keep her voice level, though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw Jarid yesterday, Elenia, and even at a distance
he looked like a thundercloud, galloping fit to break his mount&rsquo;s neck and his
own. If I know your husband, he&rsquo;s already planning a way to cut you out of
this. He would spit in the Dark One&rsquo;s eye for you.&rdquo; That was true; he would.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you can see it would be best if I were part of those plans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My husband signed the same pledge you did, Naean, and he is an honorable
man.&rdquo; He was too honorable for his own good, in simple fact, but what Elenia
wanted had been his guide since before their wedding vows. Jarid had signed the
pledge because she wrote and told him to, not that she had any choice as
matters were, and he would even repudiate it, however reluctantly, if she were
mad enough to ask it. Of course, there was the difficulty in letting him know
what she did want at the moment. Arymilla was very careful not to let her
within a mile of him. She had everything in hand&mdash;as far as she could in the
circumstances&mdash;but she needed to let Jarid know, if only to stop him from
&ldquo;cutting her a way out.&rdquo; Spit in the Dark One&rsquo;s eye? He could take them both to
ruin in the belief he was helping her, and he might do it even knowing it meant
their ruination.</p>

<p>It required a great effort not to allow the
frustration and fury suddenly welling up inside her to show on her face, but
she covered the strain with a smile. She took considerable pride in being able
to produce a smile for any situation. This one held a touch of surprise. And a
touch of disdain. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not planning anything, Naean, and neither is Jarid, I&rsquo;m
sure. But if I were, why would I include you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because if I am not included in those plans,&rdquo; Naean said bluntly,
&ldquo;Arymilla might learn of them. She may be a blind fool, but she&rsquo;ll see once
she&rsquo;s told where to look. And you might find yourself sharing a tent with your
<em>betrothed</em> every night, not to mention <em>protected</em> by his armsmen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elenia&rsquo;s smile melted, but her voice turned to ice,
matching the frozen ball that abruptly filled her stomach. &ldquo;You want to be
careful what you say, or Arymilla may ask her Taraboner to play cat&rsquo;s cradle
with you again. In truth, I think I can guarantee as much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed impossible that Naean&rsquo;s face could grow any whiter, yet it
did. She actually swayed in her saddle, and caught Elenia&rsquo;s arm as if to keep
from falling. A gust of wind flung her cloak about, and she let it flail. Those
once-cold eyes were quite wide, now. The woman made no effort to hide her fear.
Perhaps she was too far gone to be capable of hiding it. Her voice came breathy
and panicked. &ldquo;I know you and Jarid are planning something, Elenia. I know it!
Take me with you, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and I will pledge Arawn to you as soon as I can be free
of Arymilla.&rdquo; Oh, she <em>was</em> shaken, to offer that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want to draw more attention than you already have?&rdquo; Elenia
snapped, pulling free of the other woman&rsquo;s grasp. Dawn Wind and the black
gelding danced nervously, catching their riders&rsquo; moods, and Elenia reined her
bay hard to quiet him. Two of the men at the fire hurriedly put their heads
down. No doubt they thought they saw two noblewomen arguing in the graying
evening and wanted to attract no part of that anger on themselves. Yes; it must
be only that. They might carry tales, but they knew better than to get mixed in
their betters&rsquo; arguments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no plans to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;escape; none at all,&rdquo; she said in a quieter
voice. Drawing her cloak close again, she calmly turned her head to check the
carts, and the nearest tents. If Naean was frightened enough&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;When an
opening presented itself&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;There was no one close enough to overhear, but
she still kept her voice low. &ldquo;Matters might change, of course. Who can say? If
they do, I make you this promise, under the Light and by my hope of rebirth, I
will not leave without you.&rdquo; A startled hope bloomed on Naean&rsquo;s face. Now to
present the hook. &ldquo;If, that is, I have in my possession a letter written in
your own hand, signed and sealed, in which you explicitly repudiate your
support of Marne, of your own free will, and swear the support of House Arawn
to me for the throne. Under the Light and by <em>your</em> hope of rebirth.
Nothing less will do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Naean&rsquo;s head jerked back, and she touched her lips with her tongue. Her
eyes shifted as though searching for a way out, for help. The black continued
to snort and dance, but she barely tightened her reins enough to keep him from
bolting, and even that seemed unconscious. Yes, she was frightened. But not too
frightened to know what Elenia was demanding. The history of Andor contained
too many examples for her not to know. A thousand possibilities remained so
long as nothing was in writing, but the mere existence of such a letter would
put a bit between Naean&rsquo;s teeth and the reins in Elenia&rsquo;s hands. Publication
meant Naean&rsquo;s destruction, unless Elenia was fool enough to admit to coercion.
She could try to hang on after that revelation, yet even a House with many
fewer antagonisms between its members than Arawn, many fewer cousins and aunts
and uncles ready to undercut one another in a heartbeat, would still break
apart. The lesser Houses that had been tied to Arawn for generations would seek
protection elsewhere. In a matter of years, if not sooner, Naean would be left
as the High Seat of a minor and discredited remnant. Oh, yes; it had happened
before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been together long enough.&rdquo; Elenia gathered her
reins. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want to set tongues wagging. Perhaps we will have another
chance to speak alone before Arymilla takes the throne.&rdquo; What a vile thought!
&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other woman exhaled as if all of the breath in her
body were leaking out, but Elenia went on about turning her horse away, neither
slowly nor in haste, not stopping until Naean said urgently, &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Looking back over her shoulder, she did just that.
Waited. Without speaking a word. What needed to be said had been said. All that
remained was to see whether the woman was desperate enough to deliver herself
into Elenia&rsquo;s hands. She should be. <em>She</em> had no Jarid to work for her. In
fact, anyone in Arawn who suggested that Naean needed rescuing likely would
find herself imprisoned for thwarting Naean&rsquo;s expressed will. Without Elenia,
she could grow old in captivity. With the letter, though, her captivity would
be of a different kind. With the letter, Elenia would be able to allow her
every appearance of complete freedom. Apparently she was bright enough to see
that. Or maybe just frightened enough of the Taraboner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will get it to you as soon as I can,&rdquo; she said at last, in a resigned
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I look forward to seeing it,&rdquo; Elenia murmured, barely
bothering to mask her satisfaction. <em>But don&rsquo;t wait too long</em>, she almost
added, and just stopped herself. Naean might be beaten, but a beaten foe could
still put a knife in your back if goaded too far. Besides which, she feared
Naean&rsquo;s threat as much as Naean feared hers. Perhaps more. So long as Naean did
not know that, however, her blade had no point.</p>

<p>As she rode back to her armsmen, Elenia&rsquo;s mood was
more buoyant than it had been since&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Certainly since before her &ldquo;rescuers&rdquo;
had turned out to be Arymilla&rsquo;s men. Perhaps since before Dyelin had imprisoned
her in Aringill in the first place, though she had never lost hope there. Her
prison had been the governor&rsquo;s house, quite comfortable, even if she had to
share an apartment with Naean. Communicating with Jarid certainly had presented
no problem, and she thought she had made some inroads with the Queen&rsquo;s Guards
in Aringill. So many of them had been new-come out of Cairhien that they were&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;unsure&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;where their true loyalties lay.</p>

<p>Now, this wonderfully fortuitous encounter with Naean
lifted her spirits so much that she smiled at Janny and promised her a bevy of
new dresses once they were inside Caemlyn. Which produced a properly grateful
smile from the plump-cheeked woman. Elenia always bought new dresses for her
maid when she felt particularly good, every one fine enough for a successful
merchant. It was one way to insure loyalty and discretion, and for twenty
years, Janny had delivered both.</p>

<p>The sun was only a red rim above the trees now, and it
was time to find Arymilla so she could be told where she was sleeping tonight.
The Light send it was a decent bed, in a warm tent that was not too smoky, with
a decent meal beforehand. She could not ask more, at present. Even that did not
dent her mood, though. She not only nodded to the clusters of men and women
they rode past, she smiled at them. She almost went so far as to wave. Matters
were progressing better than they had in quite some time. Naean was not simply
disposed of as a rival for the throne, she had been leashed and brought to
heel, or as good as, and that might&mdash;would!&mdash;be sufficient to bring Karind
and Lir. And there were those who would accept <em>anyone</em> other than another
Trakand on the throne. Ellorien, for one. Morgase had had her <em>flogged!</em> Ellorien
would never stand for any Trakand. Aemlyn, Arathelle and Abelle were
possibilities, too, with their own grievances that could be exploited. Perhaps
Pelivar or Luan, as well. She had her feelers out. And she would not squander
the advantage of Caemlyn, as that hoyden Elayne had. Historically, holding
Caemlyn was enough to gather the support of at least four or five Houses by
itself.</p>

<p>The timing would be key, certainly, or all the advantage would fall to
Arymilla, but Elenia could already see herself seated on the Lion Throne, with
the High Seats kneeling to swear fealty. She already had her list of which High
Seats would need to be replaced. No one who had opposed her was going to be
allowed to cause her trouble later. A series of unfortunate accidents would see
to that. A pity she could not choose their replacements, but accidents could
happen with incredible frequency.</p>

<p>Her happy contemplation was shattered by the scrawny
man who suddenly came up beside her on a stocky gray, his eyes feverishly
bright in the fading light. For some reason, Nasin had sprigs of green fir stuck in his thin white hair. It made him
look as if he had been climbing in a tree, and his red silk coat and cloak were
so worked with brightly colored flowers they could have passed for Illianer
carpets. He was ludicrous. He was also High Seat of the most powerful single
House in Andor. And he was quite mad. &ldquo;Elenia, my darling treasure,&rdquo; he brayed,
spraying spittle, &ldquo;how sweet the sight of you is to my eyes. You make honey
seem stale and roses drab.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without need for conscious thought, she hastily reined Dawn Wind back and
to the right, putting Janny&rsquo;s brown mare between her and him. &ldquo;I am <em>not</em> your
betrothed, Nasin,&rdquo; she snapped, seething at having to say that aloud for
everyone to hear. &ldquo;I am <em>married</em>, you old fool! Wait!&rdquo; she added,
flinging up a hand.</p>

<p>The imperative word and the gesture were for her
armsmen, who had laid hands on sword hilts and were glaring at Nasin. Some
thirty or forty men wearing House Caeren&rsquo;s Sword and Star were following the
man, and they would not hesitate to cut down anyone they thought was
threatening their High Seat. Some already had blades half-drawn. They would not
harm her, of course. Nasin would have them hanged to a man if she was even
bruised. Light, she did not know whether to laugh or cry over that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you still afraid of that young oaf Jarid?&rdquo; Nasin
demanded, angling his mount to follow her. &ldquo;He has no right to keep bothering
you. The better man won, and he should acknowledge it. I&rsquo;ll challenge him!&rdquo; One
hand, plainly bony even in its tight red glove, fumbled at a sword he probably
had not drawn in twenty years. &ldquo;I will cut him down like a dog for frightening
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elenia moved Dawn Wind deftly, so they described a circle around Janny,
who murmured apologies to Nasin and pretended to take her mare out of his way
while getting in it. Mentally, Elenia added a little embroidery to the dresses
she would buy. Addlepated as he was, Nasin could go in a blink from honeyed
words of courtly love to groping at her as if she were the lowest sort of
tavern maid. That, she could not endure, not again, certainly not in public.
Circling, she forced a worried smile onto her face, though in truth, the smile
took more effort than the worry. If this old fool forced Jarid to kill him, it
would ruin everything! &ldquo;You know I could not abide to have men fight over me,
Nasin.&rdquo; Her voice was breathy and anxious,
but she did not try to control it. Breathy and anxious suited well enough. &ldquo;How
could I love a man with blood on his hands?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ridiculous man frowned down that long nose till
she began to wonder whether she had gone too far. He was mad as a spring hare,
but not in everything. Not always. &ldquo;I had not realized you were so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;sensitive,&rdquo; he said finally. Without stopping his effort to ride around Janny.
His decrepit face brightened. &ldquo;But I should have known. I will remember, from
now on. Jarid may live. So long as he doesn&rsquo;t pester you.&rdquo; Abruptly, he seemed
to notice Janny for the first time, and with an irritated grimace, he raised
his hand high, balling it into a fist. The plump woman visibly steeled herself
for the blow without moving aside, and Elenia gritted her teeth. Silk
embroidery. Definitely unsuitable for a maid, but Janny had earned it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord Nasin, I have been looking for you <em>everywhere</em>&rdquo; a woman&rsquo;s
simpering voice cried, and the circling stopped.</p>

<p>Elenia exhaled in relief as Arymilla rode up in the twilight with her entourage,
and had to stifle a surge of fury at feeling relief. In over-elaborately
embroidered green silk, with lace under her chin and at her wrists, Arymilla
was plump verging on stout, with a vacuous smile and brown eyes that were
always wide with affected interest even when there was nothing to be interested
in. Lacking the brains to tell the difference, she possessed just enough
cunning to know there were things that should interest her, and she did not
want anyone to think she had missed them. The only real concern she had was her
own comfort and the income to ensure it, and the only reason she wanted the
throne was that the royal coffers could provide greater comfort than the
revenues of any High Seat. Her entourage was larger than Nasin&rsquo;s, though only
half were armsmen wearing the Four Moons of her House. For the most part,
hangers-on and sycophants made up the rest, lesser lords and ladies of minor
Houses and others willing to lick Arymilla&rsquo;s wrist for a place near power. She
did love people to fawn over her. Naean was there, too, on the edge of the
group with her armsmen and maid, apparently cool-eyed and in control of herself
once more. But keeping well away from Jaq Lounalt, a lean man with one of those
farcical Taraboner veils covering his huge mustaches and a conical cap pushing
the hood of his cloak to a ridiculous height. The fellow smiled too much, as
well. He hardly looked a man who could reduce someone to begging with just a
few cords.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arymilla,&rdquo; Nasin said in a confused tone, then frowned at his fist as
if surprised to find it raised. Lowering his hand to the pommel of his saddle,
he beamed a smile at the silly woman. &ldquo;Arymilla, my dear,&rdquo; he said warmly. Not
with the sort of warmth he often directed at Elenia. Somehow, it seemed, he had
become at least half-convinced that Arymilla was his daughter, and his favorite
at that. Once, Elenia had heard him reminiscing at length with the woman about
her &ldquo;mother,&rdquo; his last wife, dead nearly thirty years now. Arymilla managed to
hold her end of the conversation, too, though she had never met Miedelle Caeren
as far as Elenia knew.</p>

<p>Still, despite all his fatherly smiles for Arymilla, his eyes sought
through the shadowed crowd on horseback behind her, and his face relaxed when
he found Sylvase, his granddaughter and heir, a sturdy, placid young woman who
met his gaze, unsmiling, then pulled her dark, fur-lined cowl well forward. She
never smiled or frowned or showed any emotion at all that Elenia had ever
detected, just kept an unvarying cowlike expression. Plainly, she had a cow&rsquo;s
wits, too. Arymilla kept Sylvase closer than she did Elenia or Naean, and so
long as she did, there was no chance that Nasin would be forced to retire from
his honors. He was mad, assuredly, but sly. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re taking good care of
my little Sylvase, Arymilla,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;There are fortune hunters everywhere,
and I want the darling girl kept safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I am,&rdquo; Arymilla replied, brushing her
overfed mare past Elenia without so much as a glance. Her tone was honey-sweet,
and sickeningly doting. &ldquo;You know I&rsquo;ll keep her as safe as I keep myself.&rdquo;
Smiling that empty-headed smile, she set about straightening Nasin&rsquo;s cloak on
his shoulders and smoothing it with the air of someone settling a shawl on a
beloved invalid. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s much too cold out for you. I know what you need. A warm
tent and some hot spiced wine. I&rsquo;ll be happy to have my maid prepare it for
you. Arlene, accompany Lord Nasin to his tent and fix him some good spiced
wine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A slim woman in her entourage gave a violent twitch,
then rode forward slowly, pushing back the hood of her plain blue cloak to
reveal a pretty face and a tremulous smile. Suddenly all lickspittles and
toad-eaters were adjusting their cloaks against the wind or snugging their
gloves, looking anywhere except at Arymilla&rsquo;s maid. Especially the women. One
of them could have been chosen as easily, and they knew it. Oddly, Sylvase did
not look away. It was impossible to see her face in the shadows of her hood,
but the opening turned to follow the slender woman.</p>

<p>Nasin&rsquo;s grin showed his teeth, making him look even
more like a goat than usual. &ldquo;Yes. Yes, mulled wine would be good. Arlene, is
it? Come, Arlene, there&rsquo;s a good girl. Not too chill, are you?&rdquo; The girl
squeaked as he swept a corner of his cloak around her shoulders and gathered
her so close she was leaning out of her saddle. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be warm in my tent, I
promise.&rdquo; Without so much as a glance back, he rode off at a walk, chortling
and whispering at the young woman under his arm. His armsmen followed with the
creak of leather and the slow, wet clop of hooves in the muck. One of them
laughed, as if another had said something funny.</p>

<p>Elenia shook her head in disgust. Pushing a pretty
woman in front of Nasin to distract him was one thing&mdash;she did not even have
to be that pretty; any woman the old fool could corner was in danger&mdash;but
using your own maid was revolting. Not as revolting as Nasin himself, though.
&ldquo;You promised to keep him away from me, Arymilla,&rdquo; she said in a low, tight
voice. That lecherous old crackbrain might have forgotten her existence for the
moment, but he would remember the next time he saw her. &ldquo;You promised to keep
him occupied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arymilla&rsquo;s face grew sullen, and she petulantly tugged her riding
gloves tighter. She had not gotten what she wanted. That was a great sin, to
her. &ldquo;If you want to be safe from admirers, you ought to stay close to me
instead of wandering about loose. Can I help it if you attract men? And I did
rescue you. I haven&rsquo;t heard any thanks for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elenia&rsquo;s jaw clenched so hard that it began to ache. Pretending that she
supported this woman of her own choice was enough to make her want to bite
something. Her choices had been made clear enough; write to Jarid or endure an
extended honeymoon with her &ldquo;betrothed.&rdquo; Light, she might have taken the choice
if not for the certainty that Nasin would lock her up in some out-of-the-way
manor and, after she had put up with his pawing, eventually forget she was
there. And leave her there. Arymilla insisted on the pretense, though. She
insisted on a great many things, some of them utterly insufferable. Yet they
had to be suffered. For the time being. Perhaps, once matters were set
straight, Master Lounalt could offer his attentions to Arymilla for a few days.</p>

<p>From somewhere she summoned an apologetic smile, and made herself bend
her neck as if she were one of the boot-licking leeches who were watching her
avidly. After all, if <em>she</em> crawled for Arymilla, it only proved they were
right to. The feel of their eyes on her made her want to bathe. Doing this in
front of Naean made her want to shriek. &ldquo;I offer you all the gratitude that&rsquo;s
in me, Arymilla.&rdquo; Well, that was no lie. All the gratitude that was in her came
about equal to a desire to strangle the other woman. Very slowly. She had to
inhale deeply before she could get the next part out, though. &ldquo;You must forgive
me for being slow, please.&rdquo; A <em>very</em> bitter word. &ldquo;Nasin made me quite
distraught. You know how Jarid would react if he learned of Nasin&rsquo;s behavior.&rdquo;
Her own voice took on a honed edge at that last, but the fool woman giggled.
She giggled!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;re forgiven, Elenia,&rdquo; she laughed, her
face lightening. &ldquo;All you need do is ask. Jarid is a hothead, isn&rsquo;t he? You
must write to him and tell him how content you are. You are content, aren&rsquo;t
you? You can dictate to my secretary. I do hate staining my fingers with ink,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly I&rsquo;m content, Arymilla. How could I not be?&rdquo; Smiling required
no effort at all, this time. The woman actually thought she was clever. Using
Arymilla&rsquo;s secretary precluded any possibility of secret inks, but she could
tell Jarid quite openly to do absolutely nothing without her counsel, and the
brainless fluff would think she was only obeying.</p>

<p>Nodding with a smug self-satisfaction, Arymilla
gathered her reins, imitated by her coterie. If she stuck a pot on her head and
called it a hat, they would all wear pots, too. &ldquo;It is getting late,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and I want an early start in the morning. Aedelle Baryn&rsquo;s cook has an
excellent repast waiting on us. You and Naean must ride with me, Elenia.&rdquo; She
made it sound as though she were honoring them, and they had no choice except
to behave as though she were, falling in on either side of her. &ldquo;And Sylvase,
of course. Come, Sylvase.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nasin&rsquo;s granddaughter brought her mare closer, but not
up beside Arymilla. She followed a little behind, with Arymilla&rsquo;s sycophants
crowding on her heels since they had not been invited to ride with Arymilla.
Despite the fitful, icy wind tugging at their cloaks, several of the women and
two or three of the men tried unsuccessfully to engage the girl in
conversation. She seldom said two words together. Still, with no High Seat in
reach to fawn over, a High Seat&rsquo;s heir would do, and maybe one of the fellows
hoped to marry well. Likely one or two were more in the nature of guards, or at
least spies making sure she did not try to communicate with anyone in her
House. This lot would find that exciting, touching on the edges of power.
Elenia had her own plans for Sylvase.</p>

<p>Arymilla was another with no objections to nattering
away when anyone with sense would be muffling herself in her cowl, and her
chatter as they rode through the dying light flitted from what Lir&rsquo;s sister
would offer at supper to the plans for her coronation. Elenia listened only
enough to murmur approvingly at what seemed appropriate spots. If the fool
wanted to offer a sworn amnesty to those who opposed her, far be it from
Elenia Sarand to tell her she was a fool. It was painful enough having to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>simper</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;at the woman without listening to her. Then one thing
Arymilla said hit her ear like an awl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You and Naean won&rsquo;t mind sharing a bed, will you? It
seems we are short of decent tents here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She flitted on, but for a moment, Elenia could not hear a word. She felt
as though her skin had been stuffed with snow. Turning her head slightly, she
met Naean&rsquo;s shocked gaze. There was no possible way Arymilla could know about
their chance meeting, not yet, and even if she did, why would she offer them a
chance to plot together? A trap? Spies to listen to what they said? Naean&rsquo;s
maid, or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Or Janny? The world seemed to spin. Black and silver flecks
floated in front of Elenia&rsquo;s eyes. She thought she was about to faint.</p>

<p>Abruptly she realized that Arymilla had addressed
something to her directly and was waiting on an answer with an increasingly
impatient scowl. Frantically, she cast her mind about. Yes, she had it. &ldquo;A
gilded coach, Arymilla?&rdquo; What a ridiculous notion. As well ride in a Tinker&rsquo;s
wagon! &ldquo;Oh, delightful! You do have such marvelous ideas!&rdquo; Arymilla&rsquo;s pleased
simper put a little ease into Elenia&rsquo;s breathing. The woman <em>was</em> a
brainless fool. Maybe there was a shortage of suitable tents. More likely she
just thought they were safe, now. Tamed. Elenia turned her bared teeth into a
simper of her own. But she put aside any idea of having the Taraboner
&ldquo;entertain&rdquo; the woman, even for an hour. With Jarid&rsquo;s signature on that pledge,
there was only one way to clear her path to the throne. Everything was in hand
and ready to go forward. The only question was whether Arymilla or Nasin should
die first.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Night pressed down on Caemlyn with a hard cold driven
deep by sharp winds. Here and there a glow of light spilling from an upper
window spoke of people still awake, but most shutters were drawn, and a thin
sliver of moon low in the sky only seemed to emphasize the darkness. Even the
snow coating rooftops and piled along the fronts of buildings where it had
escaped the day&rsquo;s traffic was a shadowy gray. The lone man muffled head to
ankles in a dark cloak, striding through the frozen slush left on the paving
stones, answered to Daved Hanlon or Doilan Mellar with equal ease; a name was
no more than a coat, and a man changed his coat whenever needed. He had worn a
number over the years. Given his wishes, he would have had his feet up in front
of a roaring fire in the Royal Palace, a mug in his hand, a pitcher of brandy
at his side, and a willing wench on his knee, but he had others&rsquo; wishes to
serve. At least the footing was better here in the New City. Not good, with
this frozen muck underfoot that could turn a careless step into a sprawl, yet a
man&rsquo;s boots were less likely to go out from under him here than back on the
steeper hills of the Inner City. Besides, darkness suited him tonight.</p>

<p>There had been few people in the streets when he
started out, and the number had dwindled away as darkness deepened. Wise people
stayed indoors once night fell. Occasionally, dim shapes skulked in the deeper
shadows, but after a brief study of Hanlon, they scuttled around corners ahead
of him, or withdrew into alleys trying to muffle their curses as they
floundered in snow that likely had not been touched by the sun. He was not
bulky, and little taller than the average run of men, with his sword and
breastplate hidden by his cloak to boot, but footpads looked for weakness or
hesitation, and he moved with an obvious self-confidence, plainly unafraid of
lurkers. An attitude helped by the long dagger concealed in his gauntleted
right hand.</p>

<p>He kept an eye out for patrols of Guardsmen as he
walked, but he did not expect to see any. The strongarms and prowlers would
have sought other hunting grounds if the Guards were about. Of course, he could
send nosy Guardsmen on their way with a word, yet he wanted no observers of any
kind, and no questions why he was so far from the palace afoot. His step
hesitated as two heavily cloaked women appeared at a crossing well ahead, but
they moved on without glancing his way, and he breathed more easily. Very few women
would venture out at this time of night without a man along to wield sword or
cudgel, and even without seeing their faces he would have wagered a fistful of
gold to a horse apple that pair were Aes Sedai. Or else some of those strange
women who filled most of the beds in the palace.</p>

<p>The thought of that lot brought a scowl, and a
prickling between his shoulder blades like the brush of nettles. Whatever was
going on in the palace, it was enough to give him the grips. The Sea Folk women
were bad enough, and not just because they went swaying along the halls in that
seductive way, then pulled a knife on a man. He had not even thought of patting
one on the bottom after he realized they and the Aes Sedai were staring at one
another like strange cats in a box. And plainly, however impossibly, the Sea
Folk were the larger cats. The others were worse, in a way. No matter what the
rumors said, he knew the look of Aes Sedai, and it did not include wrinkles.
Yet some of them could channel, and he had the disturbing notion that they all
could. Which made no sense at all. Maybe the Sea Folk had some sort of peculiar
dispensation, but as for these Kin, as Falion called them, everyone knew that
if three women who could channel and were not Aes Sedai sat down at the same
table, Aes Sedai would appear before they could finish a pitcher of wine and
tell them to move on and never speak to one another again. And make sure they
did it, besides. That was given. But there those women sat in the palace, over
a hundred of them, holding their private meetings, walking around Aes Sedai
without one frown between them. Until today, anyway, and
whatever had set them huddling like frightened hens, the Aes Sedai had been
every bit as anxious. There were too many oddities to suit him. When Aes Sedai
behaved oddly, it was time for a man to look to the safety of his own skin.</p>

<p>With a curse
he jerked himself out of his reverie. A man needed to look out for his skin in
the night, too, and letting his concentration drift was no way to do it. At least
he had not stopped, or even slowed. After a few more steps, he smiled a thin
smile and thumbed the blade of his dagger. The wind sighed down the street and
fell, whistled across rooftops and fell, and in the brief silences between he
could hear the faint crunch of the boots that had been following him since
shortly after he left the palace.</p>

<p>At
the next crossing street, he turned to his right at the same steady unhurried
pace, then suddenly flattened his back against the front of a stable that stood
hard on the corner. The wide stable doors were shut, and likely barred on the
inside, but the smell of horse and horse dung hung in the icy air. The inn
across the street was closed up tight, as well, its windows shuttered and dark,
the only sound aside from the wind the creak of its swinging sign he could not
make out in the night. No one to see what they should not.</p>

<p>He
had a moment&rsquo;s warning, the sound of boots quickened in an effort not to let
him out of sight too long, and then a cowled head was thrust cautiously around
the corner. Not cautiously enough, of course. His left hand darted into the
cowl to seize a throat at the same time his right made a practiced stop-thrust
with the dagger. He half expected to find a breastplate, or a mail shirt under
the man&rsquo;s coat, and he was ready if he did, but an inch of steel sank easily
beneath the fellow&rsquo;s breastbone. He did not know why that seemed to paralyze a
man&rsquo;s lungs, so he could not cry out, until he had drowned in his own blood,
but he knew that it did. Still, tonight he had no time to wait. No Guards in
sight at present did not mean matters would stay that way for long. With a
quick wrench, he slammed the man&rsquo;s head against the stable&rsquo;s stone wall hard
enough to crack a skull, then shoved his dagger to the hilt, feeling the blade
grate as it dug through the fellow&rsquo;s spine.</p>

<p>His
breathing remained steady&mdash;killing was just a thing that had to be done now and again, nothing to get excited
over&mdash;but he hurriedly lowered the corpse to the snow against the wall and
crouched beside it, wiping his blade on the dead man&rsquo;s dark coat while sticking
his other hand into his armpit to tug off his steel-backed gauntlet. Head
swiveling, he watched the street both ways as he felt quickly across the man&rsquo;s
face in the darkness. A rasp of stubble under his fingers told him that it <em>was</em>
a man, but no more. Man, woman or child made no difference to him&mdash;fools
behaved as though children had no eyes to see or tongues to tell what they saw&mdash;yet he wished there had been a mustache or a bulbous nose, anything to spark
a memory and tell him who this fellow had been. A squeeze at the dead man&rsquo;s
sleeve found thick wool, neither fine nor particularly rough, and a sinewy arm
that could have belonged to clerk or wagon driver or footman. To any man, in
short, just like the coat. Searching down the body, he rifled through the
fellow&rsquo;s pockets, finding a wooden comb and a ball of twine, which he tossed
aside. At the man&rsquo;s belt, his hand paused. A leather sheath hung there, empty.
No man on earth could have drawn a dagger after Hanlon&rsquo;s blade found his lungs.
Of course, there was good cause for a man to carry his knife unsheathed when he
walked out at night, but the reason that came most readily to mind right then
was to stab someone in the back or cut a throat.</p>

<p>It was only a fleeting pause, though. Wasting no time on speculation,
he sliced off the fellow&rsquo;s purse beneath the drawstrings. The weight of the
coins he spilled into his hand and hastily stuffed into his own pocket told him
there was no gold, likely not even a piece of silver, but a cut purse and no
coins would make whoever found the body think him the prey of strongarms.
Straightening, he tugged on his gauntlet, and only moments after driving his
blade home, he was striding along the slush-covered pavement once more, dagger
held close to his side beneath his cloak and eyes wary. He did not relax until
he was a street away from the dead man, and then he did not relax very far.</p>

<p>Most people who heard of the killing would accept the
tale of murder for theft that he had laid out for them, but not whoever had
sent the fellow. Following all the way from the palace meant that he had been
sent, but by whom? He was fairly sure that any of the Sea Folk who wanted a
knife put in him would have done the deed herself. For all that the Kin
troubled him just by being there, they seemed to keep quiet and walk small.
True, people who practiced avoiding notice were the most likely to resort to a
hired knife in the night, but he had never exchanged more than three words at a
time with any of them, and he certainly had never tried to finger one. The Aes
Sedai seemed more likely, yet he was sure he had done nothing to rouse their
suspicions. Still, any one of them might have her own reasons for wanting him
dead. You could never tell with Aes Sedai. Birgitte Trahelion was a silly bint
who seemed to think she really was a character out of a story, maybe even the
real Birgitte, if there had ever been a real Birgitte, but she could well think
he was a threat to her position. She might be a strumpet, wiggling around the
corridors in those trousers the way she did, yet she had a cold eye. That one
could order a throat slit without blinking. The last possibility was the one
that worried him most, though. His own masters were not the most trusting of
people, and not always the most trustworthy. And the Lady Shiaine Avarhin, who
currently gave him his orders, was the one who had sent a summons that had
pulled him into the night. Where a fellow just happened to be waiting to follow
him, knife in hand. He did not believe in coincidence, no matter what people
said about this al&rsquo;Thor.</p>

<p>Thoughts of turning back to the palace came and went
in a flash. He had gold tucked away; he could bribe his way through the gates
as easily as anyone else, or just order one opened long enough to let him ride
out. But it would mean spending the rest of his life watching his back, and
anyone who came inside arm&rsquo;s length of him might be the one sent to kill him.
Not so different from the way he lived now. Except for the certainty that
someone would put poison in his soup or a knife through his ribs sooner or
later. Besides, that stone-eyed trull Birgitte was the most likely culprit. Or
an Aes Sedai. Or maybe he had offended these Kin somehow. Still, it always paid
to be careful. His fingers flexed around the dagger&rsquo;s hilt. Life was good at
the moment, with plenty of comfort and plenty of women impressed or frightened
into compliance by a Captain of the Guards, but life on the run was always
preferable to death here and now.</p>

<p>Finding the correct street, much less the correct
house, was not easy&mdash;one narrow side street looked very like another when darkness
swathed both&mdash;but he took a care and eventually found himself pounding on the
front doors of a tall, shadowed pile that could have belonged to a wealthy but
discreet merchant. Except he knew now that it did not. Avarhin was a tiny
House, extinct some said, but one daughter of it remained, and Shiaine
possessed money.</p>

<p>One of the doors swung open, and he flung up a hand against the sudden
glare of light. His left hand; the dagger in his right, he kept concealed and
ready. Squinting through his spread fingers, he recognized the woman at the
door, in the plain dark dress of a maid. Not that that eased his mind by a
hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give us a kiss, Falion,&rdquo; he said as he stepped inside. Leering, he
reached for her. Left-handed, of course.</p>

<p>The long-faced woman brushed his hand aside and shut the door firmly
behind him. &ldquo;Shiaine is closeted with a visitor in the front sitting room
upstairs,&rdquo; she said calmly, &ldquo;and the cook is in her bedchamber. There is no one
else in the house. Hang your cloak on the rack. I will let her know you are
here, but you may have to wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hanlon let his leer vanish and his hand drop. For all
of her ageless face, handsome was the best that Falion could be called, and
even that might be stretching the truth, with her cold gaze and a colder manner
in the bargain. She was hardly the sort of woman he would have chosen to
fondle, but it seemed she was being punished by one of the Chosen and he was
supposed to be part of the punishment, which altered matters. To some extent.
Tumbling a woman who had no choice had never troubled him, and Falion certainly
had none. Her maid&rsquo;s dress was simple truth; she did the work of four or five
women by herself, maids and scullions and spit-girl, sleeping when she could
and truckling whenever Shiaine frowned. Her hands were rough and red from doing
laundry and scrubbing floors. Yet she was likely to survive her punishment, and
the last thing he wanted was an Aes Sedai with a personal grudge against Daved
Hanlon. Not when circumstances might well change before he had an opportunity
to put a knife through her heart, anyway. Reaching an accommodation with her
had been easy, though. She seemed to have a practical view. When others could
see, he rumpled her every time she came in reach, and when there was time, he bundled
her up to her tiny maid&rsquo;s room under the eaves. Where they mussed the
bedclothes, then sat on the narrow bed in the cold and exchanged information.
Though at her urging, he did give her a few bruises, just in case Shiaine chose
to check. He hoped she remembered that it was at her urging.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are
the others?&rdquo; he said, swinging his cloak off and hanging it on the
leopard-carved cloak rack. The sound of his boots on the floor tiles bounced
from the entry hall&rsquo;s high ceiling. It was a fine space, with painted plaster
cornices and several rich wall hangings on carved panels that were polished to
a faint glow, well lit by mirrored stand-lamps with enough gilding for the
Royal Palace itself, but burn him if it was much warmer than outside. Falion
raised an eyebrow at the dagger in his hand, and he sheathed it with a tight
smile. He could have it out again faster than anyone would believe, and his
sword near as fast. &ldquo;The streets are full of thieves at night.&rdquo; Despite the
chill, he removed his gauntlets and tucked them behind his sword belt. Anything
else might make it appear he thought himself in danger. The breastplate should
be enough anyway, come the worst.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I
do not know where Marillin is,&rdquo; she said over her shoulder, already turning
away and gathering her skirts for the stairsteps. &ldquo;She went out before sunset.
Murellin is in the stables with his pipe. We can talk after I inform Shiaine
you&rsquo;ve arrived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Watching
her climb the stairs, he grunted. Murellin, a hulking fellow Hanlon did not
like at his back, was banished to the stables behind the house whenever he
wanted to smoke his pipe, because Shiaine disliked the smell of the rough tabac
he used, and since he usually took a pot of ale with him, or even a pitcher, he
should not be coming in any time soon. Marillin worried him more. She was Aes
Sedai, too, apparently as much under Shiaine&rsquo;s orders as Falion,
or himself, but he had no agreements with her. No arguments, either, yet he
distrusted any Aes Sedai on principle, Black Ajah or not. Where had she gone?
To do what? What a man did not know could kill him, and Marillin Gemalphin
spent entirely too much time off doing things he knew nothing about. He was
coming to the conclusion that there were entirely too many things in Caemlyn he
knew nothing about. Past time he learned, if he wanted to
live.</p>

<p>With Falion gone, he went from the icy entry hall
straight to the kitchen at the back of the house. The brick-walled room was
empty, of course&mdash;the cook knew better than to poke her nose out of her room
in the basement once she was sent away for the night&mdash;and the black iron stove
and the ovens stood cold, but a small blaze on the long stone hearth made the
kitchen one of the few rooms in the house that would be warm. Compared to the
rest, at least. Shiaine was a stingy woman, except when it came to her own
comforts. The fire here was only in case she happened to want mulled wine in
the night, or a heated egg-milk.</p>

<p>He had been in this house above half a dozen times
since coming to Caemlyn, and he knew which cabinets held the spices and which
room off the kitchen always held a cask of wine. Always good wine. Shiaine never
stinted there. Not with that she intended to drink herself, anyway. By the time
Falion returned, he had the honeypot and a dish of ginger and cloves sitting on
the wide kitchen table with a pitcher full of wine, and a poker thrust into the
fire. Shiaine might say &ldquo;come now&rdquo; and mean &ldquo;now,&rdquo; but when she wanted to make
a man wait, it could be near daylight before she saw him. These calls always
cost him sleep, burn the woman!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is the visitor?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He gave no name, not to me,&rdquo; Falion said, propping
the door to the hall open with a chair. That let some of the sparse warmth leak
out, but she would want to be able to hear if Shiaine summoned her. Or maybe
she wanted to make sure the other woman was not able to eavesdrop. &ldquo;A lean man,
tall and hard, with the look of a soldier. An officer of some rank, maybe a
noble, by his manner, and Andoran by his accents. He seems intelligent and cautious.
His clothes are quite plain, though costly, and he wears no rings or pins.&rdquo;
Frowning at the table, she turned to one of the tall open-front cabinets beside
the door to the hallway and added a second pewter cup to the one he had set
out for himself. It had never occurred to him to set out two. Bad enough he had
to fix his own wine. Aes Sedai or no Aes Sedai, she was the maid. But she took
a chair at the table and pushed the dish of spices away from her for all the
world as though she expected him to serve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shiaine had two visitors yesterday, however, more
careless than this fellow,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;One, in the morning, had the Golden
Boars of Sarand on the cuff of his gauntlets. He probably thought no one would
notice small-work, if he thought at all. A plump, yellow-haired man in his
middle years who looked down his nose at everything, complimented the wine as though
surprised to find a decent vintage in the house, and wanted Shiaine to have me
beaten for showing insufficient respect.&rdquo; She said even that in a cold,
measured voice. The only time she had had any heat in her was when Shiaine put
the strap to her. He had heard her howl right enough then. &ldquo;A countryman who
has seldom been to Caemlyn but believes he knows how his betters behave, I
should say. You can mark him by a wart on his chin and a small half-moon scar
beside his left eye. The fellow in the afternoon was short and dark, with a
sharp nose and wary eyes, and no scars or marks I could see, though he wore a
ring with a square garnet on his left hand. He was sparing with words, very
mindful to give away nothing in the little I heard, but he carried a dagger
with the Four Moons of House Marne on the pommel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Folding his arms, Hanlon leaned against the side of
the fire place and kept his face smooth despite a desire to scowl. He had been
sure that the plan was for Elayne to take the throne, though what came after
remained a mystery. She had been promised to him as a queen. Whether or not she
wore a crown when he took her mattered not a whit to him except for the spice
it added&mdash;breaking that long-legged bit to saddle would be pure pleasure if
she had been a farmer&rsquo;s daughter, especially after the chit cut a slice off him
today in front of all those other women!&mdash;but dealings with Sarand and Marne
said maybe Elayne was meant to die uncrowned. Maybe, in spite of all the
promises that he could romp a queen, he had been placed where he was so he
could kill her at some selected moment, when her death would bring some
specific result sought by Shiaine. Or rather by the Chosen who had given her
her orders. Moridin, the fellow was called, a name Hanlon had never heard
before coming to this house. That did not trouble him. If a man had the nerve
to call himself one of the Chosen, Hanlon was not fool enough to question it.
The likelihood that he was no more than a dagger in this did trouble him. So
long as a dagger did the job, what matter if it broke in the doing? Much better
to be the fist on the hilt than the blade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see any gold change hands?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Did
you hear anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would have said,&rdquo; she replied thinly. &ldquo;And by our
agreement, it is my turn for a question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He managed to mask his irritation behind an expectant
look. The fool woman always asked about the Aes Sedai in the palace or those
she called the Kin, or about the Sea Folk. Silly questions. Who was friendly
with whom, and who unfriendly. Who exchanged private words and who avoided one
another. What he had heard them say. As if he had nothing to do with his time
but lurk around the hallways spying on them. He never lied to her&mdash;there was
too much chance she might learn the truth, even mired here in this house as a
maid; she was Aes Sedai, after all&mdash;but it was growing difficult to come up
with something he had not already told her, and she was adamant that he give
information if he expected to receive any. Still, he had a few tidbits to offer
today, some of the Sea Folk going off, and the whole lot of them jumping for
most of the day as if they had icicles shoved down their backs. She would have
to settle for that. What he needed to know was important, not bloody gossip.</p>

<p>Before she could get her question out, though, the
door to the outside opened. Murellin was large enough that he almost filled the
doorway, yet icy cold still swirled in, a gust that made the small fire dance
and sent sparks flying up the chimney until the big man pushed the door shut.
He gave no sign that he felt the chill, but then, his brown coat looked thick
as two cloaks. Besides, the man was not only the size of an ox, he had the wits
of one. Setting a tall wooden mug down on the table with a thump, he tucked his
thumbs behind his wide belt and eyed Hanlon resentfully. &ldquo;You messing with my
woman?&rdquo; he muttered.</p>

<p>Hanlon gave a start. Not from any fear of Murellin, not with the oaf on
the other side of the table. What startled him was the Aes Sedai leaping from
her chair and snatching up the wine pitcher. Dumping in the ginger and cloves,
she added a scoop of honey and swirled the pitcher around as if that was going
to mix everything, then used a fold of her skirt to pull the poker from the
fire and shove it into the wine without checking to see whether it was hot
enough yet. She never looked in Murellin&rsquo;s direction at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your woman?&rdquo; Hanlon said carefully. That earned a smirk from the other
man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Near enough. The Lady figured I might as well use
what you aren&rsquo;t. Anyway, Fally and me keep each other warm nights.&rdquo; Murellin
started around the table, still grinning, but at the woman, now. A shout echoed
in the hallway, and he stopped with a sigh, his grin fading.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Falion!&rdquo; Shiaine&rsquo;s distant voice called sharply. &ldquo;Bring Hanlon up now
and be quick about it!&rdquo; Falion set the pitcher on the table hard enough to slop
wine over the rim and was heading for the door before Shiaine finished. When
the other woman spoke, Falion jumped.</p>

<p>Hanlon jumped too, if for a different reason. Catching up to her, he
seized her arm as she took the first step on the stairs. A quick glance back
showed the kitchen door closed. Maybe Murellin did feel the cold. He kept his
voice low anyway. &ldquo;What was that all about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is none of your business,&rdquo; she said curtly. &ldquo;Can you get me
something that will make him sleep? Something I can put in his ale or wine? He
will drink anything, however it tastes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Shiaine thinks I&rsquo;m not obeying orders, it bloody
well is my business, and you ought to see it that way, too, if you have two
bloody thoughts to rub together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She tilted her head, staring down that long nose at him, cold as a fish.
&ldquo;This has nothing to do with you. As far as Shiaine is concerned, I will still
<em>belong</em> to you when you are here. You see, certain matters changed.&rdquo;
Suddenly, something unseen grasped his wrist tightly and pulled his hand from
her sleeve. Something else latched on to his throat, squeezing till he could
not draw breath. Futilely, he scrabbled left-handed for his dagger. Her tone
remained cool. &ldquo;I thought certain other matters should change accordingly, but
Shiaine does not see things logically. She says that when the Great Master
Moridin wishes my punishment lessened, he will say so. Moridin <em>gave</em> me
to her. Murellin is her way of making sure I understand that. Her way of
making sure I know that I am her <em>dog</em> until she says otherwise.&rdquo; Abruptly
she drew a deep breath, and the pressure vanished from his wrist and throat.
Air had never tasted so sweet. &ldquo;You can get what I ask for?&rdquo; she said, as calm
as if she had not just tried to kill him with the bloody Power. Just the
thought that that had been touching him made his skin crawl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; he began hoarsely, and stopped to swallow, rubbing at his
throat. It felt as though it had been cinched in a hangman&rsquo;s noose. &ldquo;I can get
you something that will put him in a sleep he&rsquo;ll never wake from.&rdquo; As soon as
it was safe, he was going to gut her like a goose.</p>

<p>She snorted derisively. &ldquo;I would be the first Shiaine
suspected, and I might as well cut my own wrists as object to anything she
decided to do. It will be enough if he sleeps the nights through. Leave the
thinking to me, and we will both be the better for it.&rdquo; Resting a hand on the
carved newelpost, she glanced up the stairs. &ldquo;Come. When she says now, she
means now.&rdquo; A pity he could not hang her up like a goose to wait for the knife.</p>

<p>Following her, his boots thumped on the treads, sending a clatter
through the entry hall, and it struck him that he had not heard the visitor
leave. Unless the house had some secret way out he did not know, there was only
the front door, the one in the kitchen, and a second at the back that could
only be reached by passing the kitchen. So it seemed he was to meet this
soldier. Maybe it was supposed to come as a surprise. Surreptitiously, he eased
his dagger in its sheath.</p>

<p>As expected, the front sitting room had a fine blaze burning away in the
wide fireplace of blue-veined marble. It was a room worth the looting, with Sea
Folk porcelain vases on the gilt-edged side tables, and tapestries and carpets
that would fetch a pretty price. Except that one of the carpets was likely
worthless, now. A low blanket-covered mound lay near the middle of the room,
and if the fellow that made it had not stained the carpet with his blood,
Hanlon would eat the boots sticking out from one end.</p>

<p>Shiaine herself was sitting in a carved armchair, a
pretty woman in gold-embroidered blue silk with an ornate belt of woven gold
and a heavy gold necklace around her slim neck. Glossy brown hair hung below
her shoulders even caught in a net of intricate lace. She looked delicate at
first glance, but there was something vulpine about her face, and her smile
never touched those big brown eyes. She was using a lace-edged handkerchief to
clean a small dagger capped with a firedrop on the pommel. &ldquo;Go tell Murellin
that I will have a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;bundle&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;for him to dispose of later, Falion,&rdquo; she
said calmly.</p>

<p>Falion&rsquo;s face remained smooth as polished marble, but
she made a curtsy that lacked little of cringing before she scuttled out of the
room at a run.</p>

<p>Watching the woman and her dagger from the corner of his eye, Hanlon
moved to the covered mound and bent to lift a corner of the blanket. Glazed
blue eyes stared out of a face that might have been hard, alive. The dead
always looked softer. Apparently he had been neither as cautious nor as
intelligent as Falion thought him. Hanlon let the blanket fall and
straightened. &ldquo;He said something you objected to, my Lady?&rdquo; he said mildly.
&ldquo;Who was he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said several things I objected to.&rdquo; She held her dagger up, studying
the small blade to be sure it was clean, then slid it into a gold-worked sheath
at her waist. &ldquo;Tell me, is Elayne&rsquo;s child yours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who fathered the whelp,&rdquo; he said wryly.
&ldquo;Why, my Lady? Do you think I&rsquo;d go soft? The last chit who claimed I&rsquo;d gotten a
child on her, I stuffed her down a well to cool her head and made sure she
stayed there.&rdquo; There were a long-necked silver wine pitcher and two chased
silver cups sitting on a tray on one of the side tables. &ldquo;Is this safe?&rdquo; he
asked, peering into the cups. Both had wine in the bottom, but a little
addition to one would have turned the dead man into easy prey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catrelle Mosenain, an ironmonger&rsquo;s daughter from Maerone,&rdquo; the woman
said, just as smoothly as if it were common knowledge, and he very nearly
flinched in surprise. &ldquo;You split her head open with a rock before you pitched
her down, no doubt to spare her drowning.&rdquo; How did she know the wench&rsquo;s name,
much less about the rock? He had not remembered her name himself. &ldquo;No, I doubt
you would go soft, but I would hate to think you were kissing the Lady Elayne
without letting me know. I would purely hate that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly she frowned at the bloodstained handkerchief in her hand and
rose gracefully to glide to the fireplace and toss it into the flames. She
stood there warming herself, never even glancing in his direction. &ldquo;Can you
arrange for some of the Seanchan women to escape? Best if it can be both those
called <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> and the ones called <em>damane</em>,&rdquo; she stumbled a little
over the strange words, &ldquo;but if you can&rsquo;t do both, then a few of the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>
should do. They will free some of the others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo; Blood and bloody ashes, she was dancing from
one thing to another worse than Falion tonight. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be easy, my Lady.
They&rsquo;re all guarded close.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask whether it was easy,&rdquo; she said, staring into the flames.
&ldquo;Can you shift guards away from the food warehouses? It would please me if some
of those actually burned. I am tired of attempts that always fail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I cannot do,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Not unless you
expect me to go into hiding right after. They keep a record of orders that
would make a Cairhienin wince. And it wouldn&rsquo;t do any good anyway, not with
those bloody gateways bringing in more wagons every bloody day.&rdquo; In truth, he
was not sorry for that. Queasy over the means used, certainly, but not sorry.
He expected the palace would be the last place in Caemlyn to go hungry in any
case, but he had lived out sieges on both sides of the lines, and he had no
intention of ever boiling his boots for soup again. Shiaine wanted fires,
though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another answer I did not ask for.&rdquo; She shook her
head, still looking into the fireplace, not at him. &ldquo;But perhaps something can
be done there. How close are you to actually&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;enjoying Elayne&rsquo;s
affections?&rdquo; she finished primly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Closer than the day I arrived in the palace,&rdquo; he
growled, glowering at her back. He tried never to offend those the Chosen had
set above him, but the chit was trying him. He could snap that slender neck
like a twig! To keep his hands from her throat, he filled one of the cups and
held it with no intention of drinking. In his left hand, of course. Just
because there was one dead man in the room already did not mean she had no
plans to make it two corpses. &ldquo;But I have to go slow. It isn&rsquo;t as if I can back
her into a corner and tickle her out of her shift.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; Shiaine said in a muffled voice. &ldquo;She
is hardly the sort of woman you are used to.&rdquo; Was she <em>laughing?</em> Was she <em>amused</em>
at him? It was all he could do not to throw down the winecup and strangle
the fox-faced bint.</p>

<p>Suddenly she turned around, and he blinked as she casually slipped her
dagger back into its sheath. He had never seen her draw the bloody thing! He
took a swallow of wine without thinking, and almost choked when he realized
what he had done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How would you like to see Caemlyn looted?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well enough, if I have a good company at my back and
a clear path to the gates.&rdquo; The wine had to be safe. Two cups meant she had
drunk, too, and if he had picked up the dead man&rsquo;s, there could not be enough
poison left in it to sicken a mouse. &ldquo;Is that what you want? I follow orders as
well as the next man.&rdquo; He did when he seemed likely to survive them, or when
they came from the Chosen. As well die for a fool as disobey the Chosen. &ldquo;But
sometimes it helps to know more than &lsquo;go there and do that.&rsquo; If you told me
what you&rsquo;re after here in Caemlyn, I might be able to help you reach it
faster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; She smiled a toothy smile while her eyes
stayed as flat as brown stones. &ldquo;But first, tell me why there is fresh blood on
your gauntlet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiled back. &ldquo;A footpad who got unlucky, my Lady.&rdquo;
Maybe she had sent the man and maybe not, but he added her throat to the list
of those he intended to slit. And he might as well add Marillin Gemalphin, too.
After all, a lone survivor was the only one who could tell the tale of what had
happened.</p>
