<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he gateway was positioned so that Elayne seemed to
 be riding out of a hole in the wall against the street, into a square marked
 out for safety by sand-filled wine barrels standing on the paving stones.
 Oddly, she could not feel a single woman channeling anywhere in the palace,
 though it housed more than a hundred and fifty with the ability. Some would
 be stationed on the city&rsquo;s outer walls, of course, too far for her to sense
 anything short of a linked circle, and a few would be out of the city altogether,
 yet someone in the palace was almost always using <em>saidar</em>, whether to
 try forcing one of the captive <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> to admit that she really could
 see weaves of the One Power or simply to smooth the wrinkles from a shawl
 without heating an iron. Not this morning, though. Windfinder arrogance often
 matched the worst shown by any Aes Sedai, yet even that must be quashed by
 what they sensed. Elayne thought that if she climbed to a high window, she
 must be able to see the weaves of that great beacon, hundreds of leagues distant
 as they were. She felt like an ant that had just become aware of mountains,
 an ant comparing the Spine of the World to the hills it had always held in
 awe. Yes, even the Windfinders must be walking small in the face of that.</p>

<p>On the eastern side of the
 palace and fronted on north and south by two-story-high stables of pure white
 stone, the Queen&rsquo;s Stableyard traditionally was given over to the Queen&rsquo;s
 personal horses and carriages, and she had hesitated over using it before the
 Lion Throne was acknowledged hers. The steps that led to the throne were as
 delicate as any court dance, and if the dance sometimes came to resemble a
 tavern brawl, you still had to make your steps with grace and precision in
 order to gain your goal. Claiming the perquisites before being confirmed had
 cost some women their chance to rule. In the end, she had decided it was not
 a transgression that would make her seem over-proud. Besides, the Queen&rsquo;s
 Stableyard was relatively small and had no other use. There were fewer people
 to keep away from an opening gateway here. In fact, when she entered it, the
 stone-paved yard was empty apart from a single red-coated groom standing in
 one of the arched stable doorways, but he turned to give a shout inside, and
 dozens more came spilling out as she guided Fireheart clear of the marked-off
 square. After all, she might have returned with an entourage of powerful
 lords and ladies, or perhaps they just hoped she had.</p>

<p>Caseille brought the Guardswomen through the gateway, and ordered most
to dismount and see to their animals. She and half a dozen more remained in
their saddles, keeping watch over the heads of the people afoot. Even here, she
would not leave Elayne unguarded. Particularly here, where she faced more
danger than in any manor she had visited. The Matherin men milled about,
getting in the way of grooms and Guards while gaping at the white stone
balconies and colonnades that overlooked the yard and the spires and golden
domes visible beyond. The cold seemed less here than in the mountains&mdash;refusing to let it touch her, as far as she could at present, did not make her
totally unaware&mdash;but men and women and horses all still breathed faint plumes
of mist. The odor of horse dung seemed strong, too, after the clean air of the
mountains. A hot bath in front of a roaring fire would be welcome. Afterward,
she would have to plunge back into the business of securing the throne, but
right now a long soak would be just the thing.</p>

<p>A pair of grooms ran to Fireheart. One took his bridle
with a hurried curtsy for Elayne, more concerned with seeing that the tall
gelding made no bother while Elayne dismounted than with making courtesies
herself, and another who made his bow and remained bent with his hands making a
stirrup for Elayne. Neither gave more than a glance at the view of a
snow-covered mountain meadow where they would normally see a stone wall. The
stable-workers were accustomed to gateways by now. She had heard that they
garnered drinks in the taverns by boasting of how often they saw the Power used
and the things they supposedly had seen done with it. Elayne could imagine what
those tales sounded like by the time they reached Arymilla. She rather enjoyed
the thought of Arymilla chewing her fingernails.</p>

<p>As she set foot on the paving stones, a cluster of Guardswomen appeared
around her, in crimson hats with white plumes lying flat on the broad brims,
and lace-edged crimson sashes, embroidered with the White Lion, that slanted
across their bright breastplates. Not until then did Caseille take the
remainder of Elayne&rsquo;s escort to the stable. Their replacements were just as
wary, eyes watching every direction, hands hovering near their sword hilts,
except for Deni, a wide, placid-faced woman who carried a long brass-studded
cudgel. They were only nine in number&mdash;<em>Only nine</em>, Elayne thought
bitterly. <em>I need</em> only <em>nine bodyguards in the Royal Palace itself!</em>&mdash;yet every one who carried a sword was expert. Women who followed the &ldquo;trade
of the sword,&rdquo; as Caseille called it, had to be good, or else sooner or later
they were cut down by some fellow whose only advantage was strength enough to
batter her down. Deni possessed no facility with a sword at all, but the few
men who had tested her cudgel regretted doing so. Despite her bulk, Deni was
very quick, and she had no concept of fighting fair, or of practice, for that
matter.</p>

<p>Rasoria, the stocky under-lieutenant in charge, seemed relieved when the
grooms led Fireheart off. If Elayne&rsquo;s bodyguard had their way, no one except
themselves would have been allowed within arm&rsquo;s reach. Well, maybe they were
not quite <em>that</em> bad, but they looked with suspicion at almost everyone
except Birgitte and Aviendha. Rasoria, a Tairen despite her blue eyes and the
yellow hair she wore cut short, was among the worst in that regard, even
insisting on watching the cooks make Elayne&rsquo;s meals and having everything
tasted before it was brought up. Elayne had not protested, however over-zealous
they might be. One experience of drugged wine was more than enough, even when
she knew she would live at least long enough to bear her child. But it was neither
the Guardswomen&rsquo;s mistrust nor the need for it that tightened her mouth. It was
Birgitte, weaving her way through the crowded stableyard, but not toward her.</p>

<p>Aviendha was
last to appear out of the gateway, of course, after she was sure that everyone
was through, and before she let the gateway wink out of existence, Elayne
started in her direction, striding off so suddenly that her escort had to leap
to maintain their guarding ring around her. As quickly as she moved, though,
Birgitte, with her thick golden braid hanging to her waist, was there first,
helping Aviendha down and handing the gray mare over to a long-faced groom who
seemed almost as leggy as Siswai. Aviendha always had more difficulty getting
off a horse than getting on, but Birgitte had more than assistance in mind.
Elayne and her escort arrived just in time to hear the woman say to Aviendha in
a low, hurried voice, &ldquo;Did she drink her goat&rsquo;s milk? Did she get enough sleep?
She feels&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Her voice trailed off at the end, and she drew a deep breath
before turning to face Elayne, outwardly calm, and unsurprised to find her right
there. The bond did work both ways.</p>

<p>Birgitte
was not a big woman, though she stood taller than Elayne in her heeled boots,
as tall as Aviendha, but she usually had a presence that was only heightened by
the uniform of the Captain-General of the Queen&rsquo;s Guards, a short red coat with
a high white collar worn over baggy blue trousers tucked into gleaming black
boots, four golden knots on her left shoulder and four bands of gold on each
white cuff. After all, she was Birgitte Silverbow, a hero out of legend. She
remained wary of trying to live up to those legends; she claimed that the
stories were grossly inflated where they were not complete fabrications. Yet
she was still the same woman who had done every one of the things that formed
the heart of those legends and more besides. Now, despite her apparent composure,
unease tinged the concern for Elayne that flowed through the bond along with
her headache and her sullen stomach. She knew very well that Elayne hated for
them to check on her behind her back.
That was not the whole reason for Elayne&rsquo;s irritation, but the bond let
Birgitte know just how upset she was.</p>

<p>Aviendha, calmly unwrapping her shawl from around her
head and draping it over her shoulders, attempted the gaze of a woman who had
done nothing wrong and certainly was not involved with anyone else who had done
anything wrong. She might have managed it if she had not widened her eyes for
an added touch of innocence. Birgitte was a bad influence on her in some ways.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I drank the goat&rsquo;s milk,&rdquo; Elayne said in a level voice, all too
conscious of the Guardswomen ringing the three of them. Facing outward, eyes
scanning the yard and the balconies and the rooftops, nearly every one was
certainly listening. &ldquo;I got enough sleep. Is there anything else you want to
ask <em>me?</em>&rdquo; Aviendha&rsquo;s cheeks colored faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I have all the answers I need for the moment,&rdquo; Birgitte replied
without a hint of the blush Elayne had been hoping for. The woman <em>knew</em> she
was tired, <em>knew</em> she had to be lying about the sleep.</p>

<p>The bond was decidedly inconvenient at times. <em>She</em> had
drunk nothing but half a cup of extremely well watered wine last night, but she
was beginning to have Birgitte&rsquo;s morning-after head <em>and</em> her sour
stomach. None of the other Aes Sedai she had spoken to about the bond had
mentioned anything of the kind, but she and Birgitte all too often mirrored one
another, physically and emotionally. The last presented real problems when her
moods were on a seesaw. Sometimes she managed to shrug it off, or fight it off,
but today she knew she was going to have to suffer until Birgitte was Healed.
She thought the mirroring must occur because they were both women. No one had
heard of anyone bonding another woman before. Few had heard of it now, to tell
the truth, and some of them seemed to believe it could not be true. A Warder
was male as surely as a bull was male. Everyone knew that, and not many stopped
to think that anything that &ldquo;everyone knew&rdquo; deserved close examination.</p>

<p>Being caught in a lie, when she was trying to follow
Egwene&rsquo;s dictate about living as if she had already taken the Three Oaths, made
Elayne defensive, and that made her blunt. &ldquo;Is Dyelin back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Birgitte said just as bluntly, and Elayne
sighed. Dyelin had left the city days before Arymilla&rsquo;s army appeared, taking
Reanne Corly with her to make gateways and speed her travel, and a great deal
depended on Dyelin&rsquo;s return. On what news she brought back. On whether she
brought anything besides news.</p>

<p>Choosing who would be Queen of Andor was quite simple, boiled down to
essentials. There were over four hundred Houses in the realm, but only nineteen
strong enough that others would follow where they led. Usually, all nineteen
stood behind the Daughter-Heir, or most of them, unless she was plainly incompetent.
House Mantear had lost the throne to Trakand when Mordrellen died only because
Tigraine, the Daughter-Heir, had vanished and Mantear had begun running heavily
to boy children. And because Morgase Trakand had gathered thirteen Houses in
her support. Only ten of the nineteen were necessary to ascend the throne, by
law and custom. Even claimants who still thought they should have the throne
themselves usually fell in with the rest, or at least fell silent and gave up
their pursuit, once another woman had ten Houses at her back.</p>

<p>Things had been bad enough when she had three declared rivals, but now
Naean and Elenia were united behind Arymilla Marne, of all people, the least
likely of the three to have succeeded, and that meant she had two Houses&mdash;two
large enough to count; Matherin and those eighteen others she had visited were
too small&mdash;her own Trakand and Dyelin&rsquo;s Taravin, to face six. Oh, Dyelin
insisted that Carand, Coelan and Renshar would come to Elayne, and Norwelyn and
Pendar and Traemane besides, but the first three wanted Dyelin herself on the
throne, and the last three seemed to have gone into hibernation. Dyelin was
firm in her loyalty, though, and tireless on Elayne&rsquo;s behalf. She persisted in
her belief that some of the Houses that were keeping silent could be convinced
to support Elayne. Of course, Elayne could not approach them herself, but
Dyelin could. And now the situation verged on desperate. Six Houses supporting
Arymilla, and only a fool would think she had not sent feelers out toward the
others. Or that some might listen just because she did have six already.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that Caseille and her Guards had
vacated the courtyard, Elayne and the others had to thread their way across the
paving stones though a crowd. The men from Matherin were finally
down off their horses, but they were still moiling about, dropping their
halberds and picking them up only to drop them again, trying to unload their
packhorse there in the stableyard. One of the boys was chasing a chicken that
somehow had gotten loose and was scuttling between the horses&rsquo; legs, while one
of the wrinkled old men shouted encouragement, though whether for the boy or
the chicken was unclear. A leather-faced bannerman with the merest fringe of
white hair remaining, in a faded red coat that strained across his belly, was
trying to establish order with the help of an only slightly younger Guardsman,
both of them likely returned from their pensions, as a good many had, but
another of the boys seemed about to lead his shaggy horse into the palace
itself, and Birgitte had to order him out of the way before Elayne could enter.
The boy, a fuzz-cheeked lad who could not have been above fourteen, gaped at
Birgitte as widely as he had at the palace. She was certainly more picturesque
in her uniform than the Daughter-Heir in a riding dress, and he had already
seen the Daughter-Heir. Rasoria gave him a shove back toward the old bannerman,
shaking her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t flaming know what I can do with them,&rdquo; Birgitte grumbled as a maid liveried in
red-and-white took Elayne&rsquo;s cloak and gloves in the small entry hall. Small in
terms of the Royal Palace. With gilded stand-lamps flickering between narrow,
fluted white columns, it was half again the size of Matherin&rsquo;s main entry hall,
though the ceiling was not so high. Another maid with the White Lion on the
left breast of her dress, a girl not that much older than the boy who had tried
to bring his horse inside, offered a ropework silver tray with tall cups of
steaming spiced wine before simultaneous frowns from Aviendha and Birgitte made
her shy back. &ldquo;The flaming boys fall asleep if they&rsquo;re put on guard,&rdquo; Birgitte
went on, scowling at the retreating maid. &ldquo;The old men stay awake, but half
can&rsquo;t remember what they&rsquo;re flaming supposed to do if they see somebody trying
to scale the bloody wall, and the other half together couldn&rsquo;t fight off six
shepherds with a dog.&rdquo; Aviendha raised an eyebrow at Elayne and nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t
here to fight,&rdquo; Elayne reminded them as they started down a blue-tiled corridor
lined with mirrored stand-lamps and inlaid chests, Birgitte and Aviendha on
either side of her and the
Guardswomen spreading out a few paces ahead of them and behind. <em>Light</em>, she
thought, <em>I wouldn&rsquo;t have</em> taken <em>the wine!</em> Her head pounded
in rhythm with Birgitte&rsquo;s, and she touched her temple, wondering whether she
should order her Warder to go find Healing immediately.</p>

<p>Birgitte had other ideas, though. She eyed Rasoria and the others in
front, then looked over her shoulder and motioned those following to fall back
a little more. That was strange. She had handpicked every last woman in the
Guards, and she trusted them. Even so, when she spoke it was in a hurried
near-whisper, bending her head close to Elayne. &ldquo;Something happened just before
you returned. I was asking Sumeko if she&rsquo;d Heal me before you got back, and she
suddenly fell over in a faint. Her eyes just rolled up in her head, and down
she went. It isn&rsquo;t only her. Nobody will admit a flaming thing, not to me, but
the other Kin I&rsquo;ve seen have been jumping out of their bloody skins, and the
Windfinders, too. Not one of them could spit if she had to. You were back
before I could find a sister, but I suspect they&rsquo;d give me the fish eye, too.
They&rsquo;ll tell you, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The palace required the population of a large village to keep running,
and servants had begun to appear, liveried men and women scurrying along the
corridors, flattening themselves against the walls or ducking into crossing
hallways to make room for Elayne&rsquo;s escort, so she explained the little she knew
in as soft a voice and as few words as possible. Some rumors she did not mind
reaching the streets, and inevitably Arymilla, but tales of Rand could be as
bad as tales of the Forsaken by the time they were twisted through a few
retellings. Worse, in a way. No one would believe the Forsaken were trying to
put her on the throne as a puppet. &ldquo;In any event,&rdquo; she finished, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nothing
to do with us here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She thought she sounded very convincing, very cool and detached, but
Aviendha reached out to squeeze her hand, for an Aiel as much as a comforting
hug with so many people to see, and Birgitte&rsquo;s sympathy flooded through the
bond. It was more than commiseration; it was the shared feeling of a woman who
had already suffered the loss she herself feared and more. Gaidal Cain was lost
to Birgitte as surely as if he were dead, and on top of that, her memories of
her past lives were fading. She remembered almost nothing clearly before the
founding of the White Tower, and not all of that. Some nights, the fear that Gaidal
would fade from her memory, too, that she would lose any remembrance of
actually having known and loved him, left her unable to sleep until she drank
as much brandy as she could hold. That was a poor solution, and Elayne wished
she could offer a better, yet she knew her own memories of Rand would not die
until she did, and she could not imagine the horror of knowing those memories
might leave her. Still, she hoped someone Healed Birgitte&rsquo;s morning-after head
soon, before her own split open like an over-ripe melon. Her ability with
Healing fell short of the task, and Aviendha&rsquo;s was no stronger.</p>

<p>Despite the emotion she could feel in Birgitte, the other woman kept her
face smooth and unconcerned. &ldquo;The Forsaken,&rdquo; she muttered dryly. And softly.
That was not a name to bandy about. &ldquo;Well, as long as it has nothing to do with
us, we&rsquo;re bloody all right.&rdquo; A grunt that might have been a laugh gave her the
lie. But then, although Birgitte said she had never been a soldier before, she
had a soldier&rsquo;s view. Long odds were usually the only odds you could find, but
you still had to get the job done. &ldquo;I wonder what they think of it?&rdquo; she
added, nodding toward the four Aes Sedai who had just stepped out of a crossing
corridor down the hallway.</p>

<p>Vandene, Merilille, Sareitha and Careane had their heads together as
they walked, or rather, the last three were clustered around Vandene, leaning
toward her and talking with urgent gestures that made the fringes on their
shawls sway. Vandene glided along slowly as if she were alone, paying no heed.
She had always been slender, but her dark green dress, embroidered with flowers
on the sleeves and shoulders, hung on her as though made for a stouter woman,
and the white hair gathered at the nape of her neck seemed in need of a brush.
Her expression was bleak, but that might have had nothing to do with whatever
the other sisters were saying. She had been joyless ever since her sister&rsquo;s
murder. Elayne would have wagered that dress had belonged to Adeleas. Since the
murder, Vandene wore her sister&rsquo;s clothes more often than her own. Not that
that accounted for the fit. The two women had been of a size, but Vandene&rsquo;s
appetite for food had died with her sister. Her taste for most things seemed to
have died then.</p>

<p>Sareitha, a Brown whose dark square face was not yet touched with
agelessness, saw Elayne just then, and put a hand on Vandene&rsquo;s arm as if to
draw her up the corridor. Vandene brushed the Tairen woman&rsquo;s hand away and
glided on with the merest glance at Elayne, disappearing on along the hallway
they had come out of. Two women in novice white, who had been following the
others at a respectful distance, offered quick curtsies to the remaining
sisters and hastened after Vandene. Merilille, a tiny woman in dark gray that
made her Cairhienin paleness seem like ivory, stared as if she might follow.
Careane adjusted her green-fringed shawl on shoulders wider than those of many
men and exchanged quiet words with Sareitha. The pair of them turned to meet
Elayne as she approached, making her curtsies almost as deep as the novices had
given them. Merilille noticed the Guardswomen and blinked, then noticed Elayne
and gave a start. <em>Her</em> curtsy matched the novices&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Merilille had worn the shawl for over a hundred years,
Careane for more than fifty, and even Sareitha had worn it longer than Elayne
Trakand, but standing among Aes Sedai went with strength in the Power, and none
of these three was more than middling strong among sisters. In Aes Sedai eyes,
increased strength gave, if not increased wisdom, at least increased weight to
your opinions. With a sufficient gap, those opinions became commands. Sometimes,
Elayne thought the Kin&rsquo;s way was better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it is,&rdquo; she said before any of the
other Aes Sedai could speak, &ldquo;but there is nothing we can do about it, so we
might as well quit worrying. We have enough right in front of us without
fretting over things we can&rsquo;t affect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rasoria half-turned her head, frowning and plainly wondering what she
had missed, but the words smoothed the anxiety from Sareitha&rsquo;s dark eyes.
Perhaps not from the rest of her, since her hands moved as if she wanted to
smooth her brown skirts, yet she was willing to follow the lead of a sister who
stood as high as Elayne. Sometimes, there were advantages to standing high
enough that you could quell objections with a sentence. Careane had already
regained serenity, if she had ever lost it. It sat easily on her, though she
looked more like a wagon driver than an Aes Sedai despite her beryl-slashed
silks and smooth, ageless coppery face. But then, Greens usually were made of
tougher stuff than Browns. Merilille did not look at all serene. Wide eyes and
half-parted lips gave her the appearance of startlement. That was usual for
her, though.</p>

<p>Elayne continued along the hallway, hoping they would
go about their business, but Merilille fell in beside Birgitte. The Gray should
have taken primacy among the three, but she had developed a tendency to wait
for someone to tell her what to do, and she shifted over without a word when Sareitha
politely asked Birgitte to give her room. The sisters were unfailingly
courteous to Elayne&rsquo;s Warder when she was acting as Captain-General. It was
Birgitte as Warder they tried to ignore. Aviendha received no such civility
from Careane, who elbowed in between her and Elayne. Anyone not trained in the
White Tower was a wilder by definition, and Careane despised wilders. Aviendha
pursed her lips though she did not draw her belt knife or even suggest that she
might, for which Elayne was grateful. Her first-sister could be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;precipitate, at times. On second thought, she would have forgiven a little
hastiness from Aviendha right then. Custom forbade rudeness toward another Aes
Sedai under any circumstances, but Aviendha could have growled threats and
waved her knife to her heart&rsquo;s content. That might have been enough to make the
threesome leave, even if in a tizzy. Careane did not seem to notice the cool
green gaze marking her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told Merilille and Sareitha it was nothing we could do anything
about,&rdquo; she said calmly. &ldquo;But shouldn&rsquo;t we be ready to flee if it comes closer?
There&rsquo;s no shame flying from that. Even linked, we would be moths fighting a
forest fire. Vandene wouldn&rsquo;t bother to listen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We really should make some sort of preparations,
Elayne,&rdquo; Sareitha murmured absently, as if making lists in her head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s when
you don&rsquo;t make plans that you wish you had. There are a number of volumes in
the library here that mustn&rsquo;t be left behind. I believe several can&rsquo;t be found
in the Tower library.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Merilille&rsquo;s voice was breathless, and as anxious as her large
dark eyes. &ldquo;Yes, we really should be ready to go. Perhaps&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Perhaps we
should not wait. Surely going from necessity would not violate our agreement. I
am sure it would not.&rdquo; Only Birgitte as much as glanced at her, but she
flinched.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we do go,&rdquo; Careane said as if Merilille had not spoken, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have
to take all of the Kin with us. Allow them to scatter, and the Light only knows
what they&rsquo;ll do or when we will ever catch them again, especially now that some
have learned to Travel.&rdquo; There was no bitterness in her voice, though only
Elayne among the sisters in the palace could Travel. It seemed to make a
difference to Careane that the Kinswomen had begun in the White Tower, even if
most had been put out and a few had run away. She had identified no fewer than
four of them herself, including one runaway. At least they were not wilders.</p>

<p>Sareitha&rsquo;s mouth tightened, though. It weighed on her that several
Kinswomen could weave gateways, and she had very different notions of the Kin.
Normally, she limited her objections to the occasional frown or disparaging
grimace, since Elayne had made her own views clear, but the stress of the
morning seemed to have loosened her tongue. &ldquo;We do indeed need to take them
with us,&rdquo; she said in a cutting tone, &ldquo;else they&rsquo;ll all be claiming to be Aes
Sedai as soon as they&rsquo;re out of our sight. Any woman who maintains she was put
out of the Tower over three hundred years ago will claim anything! They need to
be kept under a close watch, if you ask me, instead of going about as they
please, most <em>especially</em> those who can Travel. They may have gone where
you told them and come back so far, Elayne, but how long before one of them
doesn&rsquo;t return? Mark my words, once one of them escapes, others will follow,
and we will have a mess on our hands we&rsquo;ll never clean up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no reason for us to go anywhere,&rdquo; Elayne
said firmly, as much for the Guards as for the sisters. That distant beacon was
still in the same spot where she had first sensed it, and if it did move, the
chance seemed small that it would move toward Caemlyn, much less actually come
there, but a rumor that Aes Sedai were planning flight might be enough to
engender a stampede, mobs clawing to reach the gates ahead of whatever could
frighten Aes Sedai. An army sacking the city would not kill as many. And these
three chattered away as if there were no one to hear but the wall hangings!
There was some excuse for Merilille, but not the others. &ldquo;We will remain here,
as the Amyrlin Seat has commanded, until the Amyrlin commands otherwise. The
Kinswomen will continue to receive every courtesy until they are welcomed back
into the Tower, and that is the Amyrlin&rsquo;s command, too, as you very well know.
And you will continue teaching the Windfinders and go about your lives as Aes
Sedai should. We are supposed to deal with people&rsquo;s fears and soothe them, not
spread senseless gossip and panic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, perhaps she had been a touch more than firm.
Sareitha put her gaze on the floor tiles like a rebuked novice. Merilille
flinched again at mention of the Windfinders, but that was to be expected. The
others gave lessons, but the Sea Folk held Merilille as tightly as they did one
of their apprentices. She slept in their quarters and normally was not seen
without two or three of them, and her trailing meekly at their heels. They
refused to accept anything less than meekness from her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, Elayne,&rdquo; Careane said hastily. &ldquo;Of course.
None of us would suggest disobeying the Amyrlin.&rdquo; Hesitating, she adjusted her
green-fringed shawl over her arms, seemingly occupied with setting it just so.
She did spare a pitying look for Merilille. &ldquo;But speaking of the Sea Folk,
could you tell Vandene to take her share of the lessons?&rdquo; When Elayne said
nothing, her voice took on an edge that would have been called sullen in anyone
not Aes Sedai. &ldquo;She says she&rsquo;s too busy with those two runaways, but she finds
enough time to keep me talking some nights until I&rsquo;m half asleep. That pair is
already so cowed they wouldn&rsquo;t squeak if their dresses caught fire. They don&rsquo;t
need her attention. She could take her portion of teaching those cursed
wilders. Vandene needs to start behaving as an Aes Sedai, too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Standing or no, rebuke or no, she gave Elayne a baleful
glare that took her a moment to smother. Elayne had been the one who made the
bargain that led to Aes Sedai having to teach Windfinders, but so far she
herself had managed to miss giving more than a handful of lessons, claiming the
press of other, more important duties. Besides, the Sea Folk saw a shorebound
teacher as a hireling, even an Aes Sedai, and a hireling with less standing
than a scullion at that. A scullion who might try to cheat on her labor. She
still thought Nynaeve had gone away just to avoid giving those lessons.
Certainly no one expected to end up in Merilille&rsquo;s state, but even a few hours
at a time was bad enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Careane,&rdquo; Sareitha put in, still avoiding
Elayne&rsquo;s eye. And Merilille&rsquo;s. In her opinion, the Gray had gotten herself into
this fix and thus deserved what came of it, but she did try not to rub salt in
the wounds. &ldquo;Vandene is distraught over her sister, and Kirstian and Zarya help
her occupy her mind.&rdquo; Whatever she thought of the other Kin, she accepted that
Zarya was a runaway, as she had to, since Zarya was one of those Careane had
recognized, and if Kirstian must be a liar, her own lie would make her pay in
full for that. Runaways were not treated kindly. &ldquo;I spend hours with her, too,
and she almost never talks of anything but Adeleas. It&rsquo;s as if she wants to add
my memories to her own. I think she needs to be allowed as much time as she
needs, and those two keep her from being alone too often.&rdquo; Giving Elayne a
sidelong glance, she drew breath. &ldquo;Still, teaching the Windfinders is certainly&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;challenging. Perhaps an hour now and then would help pull her out of
despondency, if only by making her angry. Don&rsquo;t you agree, Elayne? Just an hour
or two, now and then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vandene will be allowed as much time to grieve for her sister as she
needs or wants,&rdquo; Elayne said in level tones. &ldquo;And there will be no more
discussion of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Careane sighed heavily and rearranged her shawl again.
Sareitha sighed faintly and began twisting the Great Serpent ring on the
forefinger of her left hand. Perhaps they had sensed her mood, or perhaps it
was just that neither looked forward to another session with the Windfinders.
Merilille&rsquo;s permanently surprised expression did not change, but then, her
sessions with the Sea Folk lasted all day and all night unless Elayne managed
to pry her away, and the Windfinders were becoming less and less willing to let
her go no matter how Elayne pried.</p>

<p>At least she had managed to avoid being curt with the three. It took an
effort, especially with Aviendha there. Elayne did not know what she would do
if she ever lost her sister. Vandene was not only grieving for a sister, she
was searching for Adeleas&rsquo;s murderer, and there could be no doubt that the
killer was Merilille Ceandevin, Careane Fransi or Sareitha Tomares. One of
them, or worse, more than one. The charge was hard to believe of Merilille, in
her present condition, but it was not easy to believe of any sister. As
Birgitte had pointed out, one of the worst Darkfriends she had ever met, during
the Trolloc Wars, was a mild-as-milk lad who jumped at loud noises. And
poisoned an entire city&rsquo;s water supply. Aviendha&rsquo;s suggestion was to put all
three to the question, which had horrified Birgitte, but Aviendha was
considerably less in awe of Aes Sedai than she once had been. The proper
courtesies must be maintained, until there was evidence to convict. Then there
would be no courtesy at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Sareitha said, brightening suddenly. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
Captain Mellar. He was a hero again while you were gone, Elayne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha gripped the hilt of her belt knife, and Birgitte stiffened.
Careane&rsquo;s face went very still, very cold, and even Merilille managed a
disapproving hauteur. Neither sister made any secret of her dislike for Doilan
Mellar.</p>

<p>With a narrow face, he was not pretty, or even handsome, yet he moved
with a swordsman&rsquo;s lithe grace that spoke of physical strength. As Captain of
Elayne&rsquo;s bodyguard, he rated three golden knots of rank, and he wore them
soldered to each shoulder of his brightly burnished breastplate. An ignorant
observer might have thought he outranked Birgitte. The falls of snow-white lace
at his throat and wrists were twice as thick and twice as long as those worn by
any of the Guardswomen, but he had left off the sash again, perhaps because it
would have obscured one set of golden knots. He claimed that he wanted nothing
more in life than to command her bodyguard, yet he frequently talked of battles
he had fought as a mercenary. It seemed he had never been on the losing side,
and victory had often come from his unsung efforts on the field. He swept off
his white-plumed hat in a deep, flourishing bow, managing his sword deftly with
one hand, then offered a slightly lesser to Birgitte with an arm across his
chest in salute.</p>

<p>Elayne arranged a smile on her face. &ldquo;Sareitha says
you were a hero again, Captain Mellar. How so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing more than my duty to my queen.&rdquo; Despite a
voice thick with self-deprecation, his answering smile was warmer than it
should have been. Half the palace thought him the father of Elayne&rsquo;s child.
That she had not crushed that rumor seemed to make him believe he had
prospects. The smile never reached his dark eyes, though. They remained as cold
as death. &ldquo;My duty to you is my pleasure, my Queen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Mellar led another sortie without orders
yesterday,&rdquo; Birgitte said in a carefully even voice. &ldquo;This time the fighting
almost spilled into the Far Madding Gate, which he had ordered left open
against his return.&rdquo; Elayne felt her face growing hard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; Sareitha protested. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t like that at all. A hundred of
Lord Luan&rsquo;s armsmen tried to reach the city in the night, but they left it too
late, and sunrise caught them. So did three times their number of Lord Nasin&rsquo;s
men. If Captain Mellar hadn&rsquo;t opened the gates and led a rescue, they&rsquo;d have
been cut to pieces in sight of the walls. As it was, he managed to save eighty
for your cause.&rdquo; Smiling, Mellar basked in the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s praise as if he had
not heard Birgitte&rsquo;s criticism. Of course, he seemed unaware of Careane and
Merilille&rsquo;s disapproving stares, too. He always managed to ignore disapproval.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you know they were Lord Luan&rsquo;s men, Captain?&rdquo;
Elayne asked quietly. A small smile that should have given Mellar warning
appeared on Birgitte&rsquo;s face. But then, he was one of those who seemed not to
believe she was a Warder. Even if he did, few except Warders and Aes Sedai knew
what the bond entailed. If anything, Mellar&rsquo;s expression grew more smug.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t go by banners, my Queen. Anybody can carry a
banner. I recognized Jurad Accan through my looking glass. Accan is Luan&rsquo;s man
to his toenails. Once I knew that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He made a dismissive gesture in a
flurry of lace. &ldquo;The rest was no more than taking a little exercise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did this Jurad Accan bring any message from Lord
Luan? Anything signed and sealed, affirming House Norwelyn&rsquo;s support for
Trakand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing in writing, my Queen, but as I said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord Luan has not declared for me, Captain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mellar&rsquo;s smile faded somewhat. He was unused to being cut short. &ldquo;But,
my Queen, Lady Dyelin says that Luan is as good as in your camp right now.
Accan showing up is proof of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of nothing, Captain,&rdquo; Elayne said coldly. &ldquo;Perhaps Lord Luan will be in
my camp eventually, Captain, but until he declares, you&rsquo;ve given me eighty men
who need to be watched.&rdquo; Eighty out of a hundred. And how many of hers had he
lost? And he had risked Caemlyn doing it, burn him! &ldquo;Since you can find time in
your duties commanding my bodyguard to lead sorties, you can find time to
arrange for watching them. I won&rsquo;t spare anyone from the walls for it. Set
Master Accan and his fellows to drilling the men I&rsquo;ve brought in from the
manors. That will keep them all busy and out of trouble most of each day, but I
leave it to you how to keep them away from the walls the rest of the time. And
I do expect them kept away from the walls and out of trouble, Captain. You may
see to it now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mellar stared at her, stunned. She had never taken him to task before,
and he did not like it, particularly in front of so many witnesses. There were
no over-warm smiles now. His mouth twitched, and a sullen heat grew in his
eyes. But there was nothing for him to do except to jerk another bow, murmur
&ldquo;As my Queen commands&rdquo; in a hoarse voice, and leave with as good a grace as he
could muster. Before he had gone three paces he was striding down the hall as
if to trample anyone who got in his way. She would have to tell Rasoria to take
care. He might try to soothe his bile by taking it out on those who had seen
and heard. Merilille and Careane gave almost identical nods; they would have
seen Mellar called down, and preferably put out of the palace, long since.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if he did wrong,&rdquo; Sareitha said carefully, &ldquo;and
I am not convinced that he did, Captain Mellar saved your life at risk to his
own, Elayne, your life and that of the Lady Dyelin. Was there really need to
embarrass him in front of the rest of us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never think I avoid paying my debts, Sareitha.&rdquo;
Elayne felt Aviendha grip one of her hands, and Birgitte the other. She gave
each of them a light squeeze. When you were surrounded by enemies, it was good
to have a sister and a friend close by. &ldquo;I am going to find a hot bath now, and
unless one of you wishes to scrub my back&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They could recognize a dismissal, and they departed more gracefully than
Captain Mellar, Careane and Sareitha already discussing whether or not the
Windfinders would actually want lessons today, Merilille trying to look every
direction at once in hope of avoiding any Windfinders. What would they talk of
later, though? Whether Elayne was having a spat with the father of her child?
Whether they had successfully hidden their guilt in killing Adeleas?</p>

<p><em>I always
pay my debts</em>, Elayne thought, watching them go. <em>And I help my friends
pay theirs.</em></p>
