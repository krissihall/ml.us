<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">F</span>rom the day they left Ebou Dar, traveling with Valan
 Luca&rsquo;s Grand Traveling Show and Magnificent Display of Marvels and Wonders
 was every bit as bad as Mat&rsquo;s darkest thoughts had made it. For one thing, it
 rained almost every day for a few hours and once for three days running, cold
 winter rain in downpours little short of snow and icy drizzles that slowly
 soaked a coat through and left you shivering before you knew it. Water ran
 off the hard-packed road as if it had been paved in stone, leaving at worst a
 thin slick of mud, but that long train of wagons and horses and people
 covered little enough ground when the sun shone. In the beginning, the
 showfolk had been all eagerness to leave the city where lightning sank ships
 in the night and strange murders had everyone looking over their shoulders,
 to be away from a jealous Seanchan nobleman who would be hunting his wife
 furiously and might take out his anger on anyone associated with spiriting
 her out her of his clutches. In the beginning, they pressed ahead as fast as
 the horses could pull the wagons, urging the animals for a quicker step,
 another mile. But every mile seemed to make them feel that much farther from
 danger, that much safer, and by the first afternoon&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have to take care of the horses,&rdquo; Luca
 explained, watching the team unhitched from his ridiculously painted wagon
 and led away to the horselines through a light drizzle. The sun still sat
 little more than halfway down to the horizon, but already gray tendrils were rising
 from the smoke holes of tents and the metal chimneys of the box-like living
 wagons. &ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s chasing us, and it&rsquo;s a long way to Lugard. Good horses are
 hard to come by, and expensive.&rdquo; Luca gave a sour frown and shook his head.
 Mention of expense always soured him. He was tight with a penny, except where
 his wife was concerned. &ldquo;Not many places between here and there worth
 stopping more than a day. Most villages won&rsquo;t provide a full crowd even if
 the whole population turns out, and you can never tell how a town will be
 until you set up. You&rsquo;re not paying me enough to give up what I can earn,
 though.&rdquo; Hitching his embroidered crimson cloak closer against the damp, he
 glanced over his shoulder toward his wagon. The smell of something bitter
 drifted through the light rain. Mat was not sure he would want to eat anything
 Luca&rsquo;s wife cooked. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re certain nobody is chasing us, right, Cauthon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Irritably
tugging his woolen cap lower, Mat stalked away through the brightly colored
sprawl of tents and wagons grinding his teeth. Not paying enough? For what he
had offered, Luca should have been willing to <em>run</em> his animals all the
way to Lugard. Well, not exactly run&mdash;he did not want to kill horses, after
all&mdash;but that puffed-up popinjay should have been willing to bloody push hard.</p>

<p>Not
far from Luca&rsquo;s wagon, Chel Vanin was seated on a three-legged stool that he
overlapped, stirring some sort of dark stew in a small kettle that hung over a
small fire. Rain dripped into the kettle from the drooping brim of his hat, but
the fat man did not seem to notice, or care. Gorderan and Fergin, two of the
Redarms, grumbled curses as they drove pegs into the muddy ground for the guy
ropes of the dirty-brown canvas tent they shared with Harnan and Metwyn. And
with Vanin, too, but Vanin possessed skills that he considered put him above
raising tents, and the Redarms agreed with only a little reluctance. Vanin was
an experienced farrier, but more importantly, he was the best tracker and the
best horsethief in the country, unlikely as that seemed to look at him, and you
could name the country you chose.</p>

<p>Fergin
caught sight of Mat, and bit off an oath as his hammer missed the tent peg and
hit his thumb. Dropping the hammer, he stuck the thumb in his mouth and
squatted there complaining shrilly around it. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be out in this
all night guarding those women, my Lord. Can&rsquo;t you hire some of those horse
handlers to do this so we can at least stay dry till we have to get wet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gorderan
poked Fergin&rsquo;s shoulder with a thick finger. He was as wide as Fergin was
skinny, and a Tairen despite his gray eyes. &ldquo;Horse handlers&rsquo;ll put up the tent
and steal everything in it that&rsquo;s loose, Fergin.&rdquo; Another poke. &ldquo;You want one
of those lightfingers walking off with my crossbow, or my saddle? That&rsquo;s a good
saddle.&rdquo; A third poke nearly pushed Fergin over sideways. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t get this
tent up, and Harnan&rsquo;ll have us standing guard all night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fergin
glowered and grumbled, but he picked up his hammer, wiping the mud off on his
coat. He was a good enough soldier, but not very bright.</p>

<p>Vanin spat
through the gap in his teeth, just missing the kettle. The stew smelled
wonderful after whatever Latelle was making, but Mat decided he was not going
to eat here, either. Tapping his wooden spoon on the rim of the kettle to clean
it, the fat man looked up at Mat through heavy-lidded eyes. His round face
often looked half-asleep, but only a fool believed it. &ldquo;At this rate, we&rsquo;ll
reach Lugard about the end of summer. If we ever do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will,
Vanin,&rdquo; Mat said, more confidently than he felt at the moment. The rough woolen
coat he had donned dry a few hours ago only shed rain in spots, and water was
trickling down his back. It was hard to feel confident with icy rain sliding
down your backbone. &ldquo;Winter&rsquo;s almost done. We&rsquo;ll move faster once spring comes.
You&rsquo;ll see. Come the middle of spring, and we&rsquo;ll be in Lugard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He
was not so sure of that, either. They covered no more than two leagues that
first day, and after that, two and a half made a good day. Not many places
could be called towns along the Great North Road, a name that began to change
very quickly as the show crept north. People called it &ldquo;the Ebou Dar Road,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;the Ferry Road,&rdquo; or sometimes just &ldquo;the
road,&rdquo; as if there were only one. But Luca stopped at every last town, real or
so-called, walled or jumped-up village with six streets and a rough-paved
excuse for a town square. Near half a day went into just getting the show set
up and the canvas wall erected around it with that huge red-lettered blue banner
hung across the entrance. Valan Luca&rsquo;s Grand Traveling Show. It was just not
in Luca to pass up the chance of a crowd. Or the coins in their purses. Or the
chance to flourish one of his bright red cloaks and bask in their adulation.
Luca liked that almost as much as the coin. Almost.</p>

<p>The strangeness of the performers and the caged
animals from far-off lands were sufficient to pull people. The animals from not
so far were enough, for that matter; few had been far enough into the
countryside to see a bear much less a lion. Only heavy rain lessened the crowd,
and when the rain was too stiff, the jugglers and acrobats refused to perform
anyway without some sort of covering overhead. Which made Luca stalk about in a
sullen snit and talk wildly of finding enough canvas tarps to shelter every
act, or having a tent made large enough to hold the entire show. One tent! The
man was nothing if not grandiose in his ambitions. Why not a palace on wheels
while he was about it?</p>

<p>If Luca and the slow way the show moved had been all
Mat had to worry about, though, he would have been a happy man. Sometimes, two
or three slow-moving trains of Seanchan settlers who had gotten an early start
passed with their strangely shaped, peaked wagons and odd-looking cattle or
sheep or goats before the first wagon from the show began to move. Sometimes
columns of Seanchan soldiers overtook them as they ambled along at a slow walk,
ranks of men wearing helmets like huge insects&rsquo; heads, stepping out smartly,
and columns of horsemen with their armor of overlapping plates painted in
stripes. Once, the riders were on <em>torm</em>, bronze-scaled creatures like
horse-sized cats. Except for having three eyes, anyway. Twenty or so of them
snaking along in a sinuous lope faster than a horse could trot. Neither the
riders nor their mounts gave the show a second glance, but the show&rsquo;s horses
went wild as the <em>torm</em> passed, screaming and rearing in the traces. The
lions and leopards and bears roared in their cages, and the peculiar deer flung
themselves against the bars trying to flee. It took hours
to quiet everything down enough for the wagons to move again, and Luca insisted
on having the caged animals&rsquo; scrapes seen to first. His animals were a large
investment. Twice, officers in thin-plumed helmets decided to check the warrant
for Lucas horses, and Mat oozed cold sweat the size of grapes until they moved
on again, satisfied. As the show crept north, the numbers of Seanchan on the
road dwindled, yet he still sweated when he saw another party, soldiers or settlers
either one. Maybe Suroth really was keeping Tuon&rsquo;s disappearance a secret, but
the Seanchan would be searching for her. All it would take was one meddlesome
officer who actually compared the numbers on the warrant with the number of
horses. He would search the wagons with a fine-tooth comb after that, for
certain. Just one officious <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> who thought there might be a woman
who could channel among the jugglers and tumblers and contortionists. He
sweated plums! Unfortunately, not everyone had a proper regard for their own
skins.</p>

<p>Outside a
flyspeck village called Weesin, a thatch-roofed little cluster of houses where
not even Luca thought two coppers could be shaken loose, Mat stood with a heavy
woolen cloak pulled around him in a driving rain and watched the three Aes
Sedai steal back into the show as the sun set. Thunder boomed in the distance.
They were swathed in dark cloaks with the hoods well up, yet he had no doubts
who they were. In the downpour, they passed within ten feet without seeing him,
but the silver medallion hanging beneath his shirt went cold against his chest.
At least one of them was channeling, or holding the Power, anyway. Burn him,
they were all three mad as loons.</p>

<p>No sooner
did the Aes Sedai vanish among the wagons and tents than three more cloaked
shapes appeared, hurrying after them. One of these women had a sharper eye,
raising a hand to point at him, but the others only paused, and then they
scurried after the Aes Sedai together. He started to curse, then left it
unuttered. He was beyond that. If he named the people he wanted wandering
around where a Seanchan patrol might see them, the Aes Sedai and the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>
would come about even with Tuon and Selucia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder
what they want?&rdquo; Noal said behind him, and Mat gave a jump that let a torrent
of rain into his cowl and down his neck.
He wished the knobbly old man would quit sneaking up on him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I intend to find out,&rdquo; he muttered, jerking his cloak
straight. He hardly knew why he bothered. His coat was only a little damp, but
his linen shirt was already soaked.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, Noal was no longer with him when he
reached the gray-streaked wagon with its fading whitewash where the Aes Sedai
and <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> slept. The man liked sticking his nose in everywhere. Maybe
he had decided he was wet enough. Blaeric and Fen were already wrapped in their
blankets beneath the wagon, apparently oblivious to rain or mud, but he would
not have wagered on either being asleep. Indeed, one sat up as he squelched up
to the wagon. Whichever it was, he said nothing, yet Mat could feel the man&rsquo;s
eyes. He did not hesitate, though, and he did not bother with knocking.</p>

<p>The interior was crowded with all six women on their
feet, dripping cloaks still in hand. Two lamps mounted in gimbals on the walls
gave a good light, better than he could have wished for, in a way. Six faces
swiveled toward him with those frozen looks women gave a man when he put a foot
where they did not want it. The air in the wagon smelled of damp wool and felt
as if lightning had just struck, or might at any moment. Rain drummed on the
roof, and thunder rolled, but the foxhead medallion felt no cooler than any
other piece of silver. Maybe Blaeric and Fen had let him come inside thinking
he would get his head snapped off. Maybe they just wanted to stay out of this
themselves. But then, a Warder was ready to die if his Aes Sedai decided it was
necessary. Not Mat Cauthon. He pushed the door shut with his hip. It hardly
gave him a twinge anymore. Seldom, anyway.</p>

<p>When he challenged them, Edesina fiercely, shaking out the black hair
that spilled down her back. &ldquo;I am grateful to you for rescuing me from the
Seanchan, Master Cauthon, and I will show my gratitude, but there are limits. I
am not your servant to be ordered about. There were no Seanchan in the village,
and we kept our faces hidden. There was no need to send your&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;watchdogs&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;after us.&rdquo; The look she shot at the three Seanchan women could have fried
eggs. Edesina was over being nervous about anyone with a Seanchan accent. She
wanted some of her own back, and the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> were close to hand. Mat was
counting on that fabled Aes Sedai self-control to keep matters short of
violence. He hoped it was not already stretched too far to hold. Those old
memories recalled Aes Sedai going up like an Illuminator&rsquo;s wares.</p>

<p>Bethamin&rsquo;s dark face showed no sign of alarm. She had finished shaking
out her cloak and hanging it on a peg while Edesina was speaking, then smoothed
her dress over her hips. Tonight, she wore faded green petticoats. She
complained that the Ebou Dari garment was indecent, and he supposed that he
would have to find her something else now they were away from the coast, but
she did fill out that very low narrow neckline nicely. She sounded too much
like a mother for his taste, though. &ldquo;They <em>did</em> keep their faces hidden,
my Lord,&rdquo; she drawled, &ldquo;and they stayed together. No one tried to sneak off.
Very well behaved, all in all.&rdquo; A mother praising her children. Or maybe a dog
trainer praising the dogs. Yellow-haired Seta nodded approvingly. Definitely a
dog trainer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If my Lord wishes to keep them confined,&rdquo; Renna said
ful-somely, &ldquo;we can always use the <em>a&rsquo;dam.</em> They really shouldn&rsquo;t be
trusted loose.&rdquo; She even offered him a bow, in the Seanchan way, bending
herself at a sharp right angle. Her big brown eyes looked hopeful. Teslyn
gasped and clutched her wet cloak to her bosom. She certainly was not over her
fear of the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>, for all she looked as though she could eat nails.
Joline, haughty as ever, drew herself up, eyes flashing. Aes Sedai serenity or
no, lightning might as well strike when Joline&rsquo;s eyes started flashing. It was
often so with pretty women.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Mat said hastily. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for that. You give those things
to me, and I&rsquo;ll get rid of them.&rdquo; Light, why had he ever saddled himself with
these women? What seemed the best idea at the time could look pure quill stupid
in hindsight. &ldquo;All of you just have to be careful. We&rsquo;re not thirty miles from
Ebou Dar yet. The roads are full of bloody Seanchan.&rdquo; He gave an apologetic
look to the three Seanchan women. They <em>were</em> on his side, after all. In a
manner of speaking. They had nowhere else to go except Egeanin, and they had
realized who had the money. Bethamin&rsquo;s eyebrows twitched upward in surprise.
Seanchan nobles did not apologize, even with a glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seanchan soldiers did pass through the village yesterday,&rdquo; Teslyn said,
her Illianer accent particularly strong. Joline&rsquo;s flashing eyes shifted to her,
but she took no notice beyond turning away to hang up her own cloak. &ldquo;They did
ask questions about strangers on the road. And some did complain about being
sent north.&rdquo; Teslyn glanced over her shoulder at the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>, then
jerked her eyes away and took a deep breath. &ldquo;It does seem the Return be aimed
east. The soldiers did believe the Ever Victorious Army will present Illian to
their empress before the end of spring. The City itself, and all the rest.&rdquo;
Supposedly Aes Sedai gave up the lands of their birth when they went to the
White Tower, but to any Illianer, the city of Illian was &lsquo;the City,&rsquo; and you
could hear the capital.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; Mat said half to himself, thinking. Soldiers talked out
of turn all the time; that was one reason you did not tell your plans to every
trooper until the last minute. Teslyn&rsquo;s thin eyebrows rose, and he added, &ldquo;It
means the road to Lugard will be clear most of the way.&rdquo; Teslyn&rsquo;s nod was curt
and not very pleased. What Aes Sedai were supposed to do and what they did were
often widely different.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t speak to anyone, my Lord, only watched the
girls,&rdquo; Bethamin said, even more slowly than usual, and Seanchan usually talked
like honey pouring in a snowstorm. She was clearly in charge among the three <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>,
but she looked at each of the others before going on. &ldquo;In Ebou Dar, all
the talk in the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> quarters was of Illian. A fat land and a fat
city, where many would earn new names. And wealth.&rdquo; She tossed that in as if
wealth hardly counted alongside a new name. &ldquo;We should have realized you&rsquo;d want
to know about such things.&rdquo; Another deep breath almost popped her out of that
dress. &ldquo;If you have any questions, my Lord, we&rsquo;ll tell you what we know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Renna made him another bow, her face eager, and Seta
piped up with, &ldquo;We could listen in the towns and villages where we stop, too,
my Lord. The girls can be shifty, but you can trust us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Why, when a woman offered to help you, did she always
start by sticking you in a pot of hot water and stoking up the fire? Joline&rsquo;s
face became a disdainful mask of ice. The Seanchan women were beneath her
notice; she made that clear with a glance. It was Mat bloody Cauthon who
received her freezing gaze. Edesina&rsquo;s mouth thinned, and she tried to stare
holes in him and the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> both.
Even Teslyn managed indignation. She was grateful for rescue, too, but she was
Aes Sedai. And she directed her frown at him. He suspected she would jump like
a startled frog if one of the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> clapped her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I want,&rdquo; he explained patiently, &ldquo;is for all of
you to stay with the wagons.&rdquo; You had to be patient with women, including Aes
Sedai. He was bloody well learning that by heart. &ldquo;One whisper there&rsquo;s an Aes
Sedai with this show, and we&rsquo;ll be hip-deep in Seanchan hunting for her. Rumors
of Seanchan with the show won&rsquo;t serve us any better. Either way, somebody will
come to find out what&rsquo;s behind it sooner or later, and we&rsquo;ll all be in the
pickling kettle. Don&rsquo;t flaunt yourselves. You need to stay low till we get
closer to Lugard. That isn&rsquo;t so much to ask, now is it?&rdquo; Lightning lit up the
wagon&rsquo;s windows with a blue flash, and thunder crashed overhead, so close it
rattled the wagon.</p>

<p>It was too much to ask, apparently, as the days wore
on. Oh, the Aes Sedai kept their hoods well up when they went outside&mdash;the
rain gave enough excuse for that; the rain and the cold&mdash;but one or another
rode on the wagon seat as often as not, and they made no real effort to pass as
servants around the showfolk. Not that they admitted who they were, of course,
or ordered anyone about or even spoke to anyone much besides each other, but
what servant clearly expected people to move out of her way? They went into the
villages, too, and sometimes the towns, if they were sure there were no
Seanchan there. When an Aes Sedai was sure of something, it had to be true.
Twice they came scurrying back when they found a town half-full of settlers on
their way north. They told him what they learned on their visits. He thought
they did. Teslyn did seem grateful, after an Aes Sedai fashion. And Edesina.
After a fashion.</p>

<p>Despite their differences, Joline, Teslyn and Edesina stuck together
like herded geese. If you saw one, you saw all three. Likely that was because
when you saw them taking a stroll, all neatly cloaked and hidden as they were,
a minute later Bethamin and Renna and Seta appeared trailing after them. Oh so
casually, but never letting &lsquo;the girls&rsquo; out of sight. The goose-herds. A blind
man could see there was tension between the two groups of women. A blind man
could see none of them were servants. The <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> had held respected positions,
positions of authority, and they moved almost as arrogantly as the Aes Sedai.
He was stuck with the story, though.</p>

<p>Bethamin and the other two were as leery of other
Seanchan as the Aes Sedai were, yet they also followed the Aes Sedai when they
went into a village or town, and Bethamin always reported the tidbits they had
picked up by eavesdropping, with Renna wearing an ingratiating smile and Seta
chirping in that &lsquo;the girls&rsquo; had missed this or that, or claimed not to have
heard; you could never be sure with someone who had the audacity to call
herself Aes Sedai; maybe he should reconsider having them leashed, just till
everything was safe.</p>

<p>Their tales really were not that different from what the sisters told
him. Townsfolk&rsquo;s talk of what they had overheard from Seanchan passing through.
Many of the settlers were nervous, their heads full of tales about savage Aiel
ravaging through Altara, though the local people all said that was up north
somewhere. It seemed someone higher might be thinking the same, though, because
many settlers had been diverted east, toward Illian. An alliance had been
concluded with someone powerful who was expected to give the High Lady Suroth
access to many lands. The women refused to be convinced that they need not
listen for rumors. They never quite got around to handing over the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>, either.
In truth, those silvery leashes and the three <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> were the only real
lever he had with the Aes Sedai. Gratitude. From an Aes Sedai! Ha! Not that he
really thought about putting those collars on the sisters again. Not often,
anyway. He was well and truly stuck.</p>

<p>He truly did have no need of what the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> and Aes Sedai
learned. He had better sources, people he trusted. Well, he trusted Thom, when
the white-haired gleeman could be routed out from playing Snakes and Foxes with
Olver or mooning over a much-creased letter he carried tucked in the breast of
his coat. Thom could walk into a common room, tell a story, maybe juggle a
bit, and walk out knowing what was in the head of every man there. Mat trusted
Juilin, too&mdash;he did almost as well as Thom, without juggling or storytelling&mdash;but Juilin always insisted on taking Thera with him, demurely clutching his
arm as they strolled into a town. To get her used to
freedom again, the man said. She smiled up at Juilin, those big eyes shining
darkly, that full little mouth asking to be kissed. Maybe she had been Panarch
of Tarabon, the way Juilin and Thom claimed, but Mat was beginning to doubt
it. He had heard some of the contortionists joking about how the Taraboner
serving girl was wearing the Tairen thief-catcher out till he could barely
walk. Panarch or serving girl, though, Thera still started to kneel any time
she heard a drawling accent. Mat figured that any Seanchan who asked her a
question would get everything she knew, beginning with Juilin Sandar and ending
with which wagon the Aes Sedai were in, all answers delivered from her knees.
Thera was a bigger danger than Aes Sedai and <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> put together, in
his book. Juilin bridled at the slightest suggestion his woman might be
unreliable, though, and spun his bamboo staff as if he was considering cracking
Mat&rsquo;s head for him. There was no solution, but Mat found a stopgap, a way to
get a little warning if the worst occurred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I
can follow them,&rdquo; Noal said, with a gap-toothed grin that said it would be
child&rsquo;s play. Laying a gnarled finger alongside his bent nose, he slipped the
other knobbly hand beneath his coat, where he kept his knives. &ldquo;Are you sure it
wouldn&rsquo;t be better just to make sure she can&rsquo;t talk to anyone? Just a
suggestion, lad. If you say not, then not.&rdquo; Mat most emphatically said not. He
had killed one woman in his life, and left another to be butchered. He was not
going to add a third to his soul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems
Suroth might have made an alliance with some king,&rdquo; Juilin reported with a
smile over a cup of mulled wine. At least Thera seemed to be making him smile
more. She huddled beside Juilin&rsquo;s stool in their cramped tent, her head lying
on his lap, and he stroked her hair softly with his free hand. &ldquo;At least,
there&rsquo;s considerable talk of some powerful new ally. And those settlers are
all frightened out of their wits by Aiel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most
of the settlers seem to be have been sent east,&rdquo; Thom said, peering sadly into
his cup. As Juilin grew happier day by day, he seemed to grow sadder. Noal was
out shadowing Juilin and Thera, and Lopin and Nerim were sitting cross-legged
at the back of the tent, but the two Cairhienin serving men had their mending
baskets out and were examining Mat&rsquo;s good coats from Ebou Dar for any repairs they thought necessary, so the small
tent still seemed crowded. &ldquo;And a great many soldiers, too,&rdquo; Thom went on.
&ldquo;Everything says they&rsquo;re going to fall on Illian like a hammer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, at least he knew he was hearing the unvarnished truth when he
heard it from them. No Aes Sedai spinning words on their heads or <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> trying
to smarm their way into his good graces. Bethamin and Seta had even learned to
curtsy. Somehow, he felt more comfortable with Renna bending herself double. It
seemed honest. Strange, but honest.</p>

<p>For himself, town or village, Mat took no more than a
quick look around, with his collar turned up and his cap pulled down, before
heading back to the show. He seldom wore a cloak. A cloak could make it
difficult to use the knives he carried tucked about his person. Not that he
expected to need them. It was just a prudent precaution. There was no drinking,
no dancing, and no gambling. Especially no gambling. The sound of dice rattling
on a table in an inn&rsquo;s common room pulled at him, but his sort of luck with
dice was bound to be remarked, even if it did not lead to somebody pulling a
knife, and in this part of Altara both men and women carried knives tucked
behind their belts and were ready to use them. He wanted to pass through unnoticed,
so he walked by the dice games, nodded coolly to the tavern maids who smiled at
him, and never drank more than a cup of wine and usually not that. After all,
he had work to do back at the show. Work of a sort. He had begun it the very
first night after leaving Ebou Dar, and a rough job it was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I need you to go with me,&rdquo; he had said then, pulling open the cupboard
built into the side of the wagon beneath his bed. He kept his chest of gold in
there, all honestly come by through gambling. As honestly as he could, anyway.
The greater part came from one horse race, and his luck was no better than any
other man&rsquo;s with horses. For the rest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;If a man wanted to toss dice or
play at cards or pitch coins, he had to be ready to lose. Domon, seated on the
other bed rubbing a hand over the bristle on his shaved scalp, had learned that
lesson. The fellow should have been willing to sleep on the floor like a good <em>so&rsquo;jhin</em>,
but in the beginning he had insisted on flipping a coin with Mat each night
for the second bed. Egeanin got the first, of course. Tossing coins was as easy
as dice.</p>

<p>As long as
the coin did not land on edge, the way it sometimes did for him. But Domon had
made the offer, not him. Until Mat had won four times straight, and then the
fifth night the coin did land on edge, three times in a row. They took turn and
turn about, now. But it was still Domon&rsquo;s turn for the floor, tonight.</p>

<p>Finding the
smallish washleather bag he was after, he stuffed it into his coat pocket and
straightened, pushing the cupboard shut with his foot. &ldquo;You have to face her
sometime,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And I need you to smooth things over.&rdquo; He needed someone
to attract Tuon&rsquo;s ire, someone to make him seem acceptable by comparison, but
he could not say that, could he? &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a Seanchan noble, and you can keep me
from putting my boot in my mouth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why
do you need to smooth things over?&rdquo; Egeanin&rsquo;s drawl was hard as a saw. She
stood against the wagon&rsquo;s door with her fists on her hips, blue eyes augering
out from beneath her long black wig. &ldquo;Why do <em>you</em> need to see her?
Haven&rsquo;t you done enough?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
tell me you&rsquo;re afraid of her,&rdquo; Mat scoffed, dodging the question. What answer
could he give that did not sound insane? &ldquo;You could tuck her under your arm
almost as easily as I could. But I promise not to let her cut your head off or
beat you up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egeanin
do no be afraid of anything, boy,&rdquo; Domon growled protectively. &ldquo;If she does no
want to go, then you trot off to court the girl by yourself. Stay the night, if
you choose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egeanin
continued to glare at Mat. Or through him. Then she glanced at Domon, her
shoulders slumped a little, and she snatched her cloak from its peg on the
wall. &ldquo;Get a move on, Cauthon,&rdquo; she growled. &ldquo;If it has to be done, best it&rsquo;s
done and over with.&rdquo; She was out of the wagon in a flash, and Mat had to hurry
to catch her up. You could almost think she did not want to be alone with
Domon, as little sense as that made.</p>

<p>Outside
the windowless purple wagon, black in the night, a shadow shifted in the deeper
shadows. The sickle moon came out from behind the clouds long enough for Mat to
recognize Harnan&rsquo;s lantern jaw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All
quiet, my Lord,&rdquo; the file-leader said.</p>

<p>Mat
nodded and took a deep breath, feeling for the washleather bag in his pocket.
The air was clean, washed by the rain and away from the horselines. Tuon must
be relieved to be away from the dung smell, and the rank odor of the animal
cages. The performers&rsquo; wagons to his left were as dark as the canvas-topped
storage wagons to his right. No use waiting any longer. He pushed Egeanin up
the purple wagon&rsquo;s steps ahead of him.</p>

<p>There were
more people inside than he expected. Setalle was seated on one of the beds,
working her embroidery hoop again, and Selucia stood at the far end scowling
beneath her head scarf, but Noal was sitting on the other bed, apparently lost
in thought, and Tuon sat cross-legged on the floor playing Snakes and Foxes
with Olver.</p>

<p>The boy
twisted around with a wide-mouthed grin that almost split his face when Mat
came in. &ldquo;Noal has been telling us about Co&rsquo;dansin, Mat,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
another name for Shara. Did you know the Ayyad tattoo their faces? That&rsquo;s what
they call women who can channel, in Shara.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I
didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Mat said, settling a grim eye on Noal. It was bad enough that Vanin
and the Redarms were teaching the boy bad habits, not to mention what he was
picking up from Juilin and Thom, without Noal filling his head with made-up
nonsense.</p>

<p>Suddenly
Noal slapped his thigh and sat up straight. &ldquo;I remember now,&rdquo; he said, and then
the fool began to recite.</p>

<p class="verse_quote">&ldquo;Fortune rides like the sun on high<br>
with the fox that makes the ravens fly.<br>
Luck his soul, the lightning his eye,<br>
He snatches the moons from out of the sky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The broken-nosed old man looked around as if just realizing anyone else was there.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to remember that. It&rsquo;s from the Prophecies of the Dragon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very
interesting, Noal,&rdquo; Mat muttered. Those colors whirled in his head just the way
they had that morning, when the Aes Sedai were panicking. They flashed away
without making a picture this time, but he felt as cold as if he had spent a
night sleeping under a bush in his skin. The last thing on earth he needed was
anybody else linking him to the Prophecies. &ldquo;Maybe some time you can recite the
whole thing for us. But not tonight, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tuon looked up at him through her eyelashes, a black porcelain doll in a
dress that was too big for her. Light, but she had long lashes. She ignored
Egeanin as if the other woman did not exist, and in truth, Egeanin was doing
her best to appear part of a cabinet built into the wall. So much for hoping
for a diversion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Toy doesn&rsquo;t mean to be rude,&rdquo; Tuon murmured in that slow honey drawl.
&ldquo;He just has never been trained in manners. But it is late, Master Charin; time
for Olver to be in bed. Perhaps you will escort him to his tent? We&rsquo;ll play
again another time, Olver. Would you like me to teach you to play stones?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olver most emphatically would. He almost wriggled, saying so. The boy
liked anything that gave him a chance to smile at a woman, not to mention a
chance to say things that should have gotten him slapped till his ears swelled
up bigger than they already were. If Mat ever found out which of his &lsquo;uncles&rsquo;
was teaching him that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;But the lad gathered the pieces of his game and
carefully rolled up the line-marked cloth without a second urging. He even made
a very good leg, thanking the High Lady, before letting Noal lead him from the
wagon. Mat nodded approvingly. He had taught the boy how to make a leg, but the
boy usually added a leer for a pretty woman. If he ever found out who&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a reason for interrupting me, Toy?&rdquo; Tuon said in cool tones.
&ldquo;It <em>is</em> late, and I was thinking of going to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made a leg and gave her his best smile. He could be polite even if
she was not. &ldquo;I just wanted to make sure you were all right. These wagons are
uncomfortable, on the road. And I know you aren&rsquo;t happy with the clothes I
could find you. I thought this might make you feel a little better.&rdquo; Fishing
the leather bag from his pocket, he presented it with a flourish. Women always
liked that little extra flourish.</p>

<p>Selucia tensed, blue eyes sharpening, but Tuon waggled her slim fingers
and the bosomy maid subsided. A little. Mat liked feisty women, by and large,
but if she ruined this, he was going to paddle her bottom. He hung on to his
smile with an effort, and even managed to ratchet it up a notch.</p>

<p>Tuon turned the bag over her hands several times
before untying the drawstrings and spilling what it contained into her lap, a
heavy necklace of gold and carved amber. An expensive piece, and Seanchan work
to boot. He was proud of finding the thing. It had been the property of an
acrobat, who had it from a Seanchan officer whose fancy she caught, but she had
been willing to sell now that her officer was left behind. It did not suit her
skin, whatever that meant. He smiled and waited. Jewels always softened a
woman&rsquo;s heart.</p>

<p>No one&rsquo;s reaction was quite what he expected, though. Tuon lifted the
necklace in front of her face with both hands, studying it as if she had never
seen such a thing before. Selucia&rsquo;s lip curled in a sneer. Setalle set her
embroidery down on her knees and looked at him, the large golden hoops in her
ears swaying as she shook her head.</p>

<p>Abruptly, Tuon thrust the necklace back over her shoulder
toward Selucia. &ldquo;It does not suit me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Would you like it, Selucia?&rdquo;
Mat&rsquo;s smile slipped a little.</p>

<p>The cream-skinned woman took the necklace between
thumb and forefinger, as if holding a dead rat by the tail. &ldquo;A piece for a shea
dancer to wear with her veil,&rdquo; she said wryly. With a twist of her wrist, she
hurled the necklace at Egeanin, snapping, &ldquo;Put it on!&rdquo; Egeanin caught the thing
just before it hit her face. Mat&rsquo;s smile slid the rest of the way off his.</p>

<p>He expected an explosion, but Egeanin immediately
fumbled open the clasp and pushed her heavy wig back to fasten it behind her
neck. Her face might have been molded from snow for all the expression on it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Turn,&rdquo; Selucia commanded, and it was a command,
without any doubt. &ldquo;Let me see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egeanin turned. Stiff as a fence post, but she turned.</p>

<p>Setalle looked at her intently, with a puzzled shake of her head, then
gave Mat a different head shake before returning to her embroidery. Women had
as many ways of shaking their heads as they had looks. This one said he was a
fool, and if he did not catch the finer nuances, he was just as glad. He did
not think he would have liked them. Burn him, he bought a necklace for Tuon,
who gave it to Selucia right in front of him, and now it was <em>Egeanin</em>&rsquo;s?</p>

<p>&ldquo;She came for a new name,&rdquo; Tuon said musingly. &ldquo;What does she call
herself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leilwin,&rdquo; Selucia replied. &ldquo;A fitting name for a shea dancer. Leilwin
Shipless, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tuon nodded. &ldquo;Leilwin Shipless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egeanin jerked as though every word was a slap. &ldquo;May I
withdraw?&rdquo; she asked stiffly, bending in sharp bow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you want to go, then go,&rdquo; Mat growled. Bringing
her in the first place had not been the best notion he ever had, but maybe he
could recover a little without her.</p>

<p>Eyes locked on the floorboards, Egeanin sank to her
knees. &ldquo;Please, may I withdraw?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tuon sat there straight-backed on the floor staring
through the taller woman, clearly not seeing her at all. Selucia eyed Egeanin
up and down, pursing her lips. Setalle pushed her needle through the cloth
stretched on her hoop. No one so much as glanced at Mat.</p>

<p>Egeanin dropped to her face, and Mat bit back a startled oath when she
kissed the floor. &ldquo;Please,&rdquo; she said hoarsely, &ldquo;I beg leave to withdraw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will go, Leilwin,&rdquo; Selucia said, cold as a queen
speaking to a chickenthief, &ldquo;and you will not let me see your face again unless
it is covered by a shea dancer&rsquo;s veil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egeanin scrambled backward on hands and knees and all
but tumbled out the door, so fast that Mat was left gaping.</p>

<p>With an effort, he managed to regain his smile. There
seemed little point in staying, but a man could make a graceful exit. &ldquo;Well, I
suppose&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tuon wriggled her fingers again, still not looking at
him, and Selucia cut him short. &ldquo;The High Lady is weary, Toy. You have her
permission to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look, my name is Mat,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;An easy name. A
simple name. Mat.&rdquo; Tuon might as well have been a porcelain doll in truth for
all the response she made.</p>

<p>Setalle set down her embroidery, though, and rose with
one hand resting lightly on the hilt of the curved dagger stuck behind her
belt. &ldquo;Young man, if you think you&rsquo;re going to lounge about till you get to see
us readying for bed, you&rsquo;re sadly mistaken.&rdquo; She smiled saying it, but she did
have her hand on her knife, and she was Ebou Dari enough to stick a man on a
whim. Tuon remained an unmoving doll, a queen on her throne somehow mistakenly
dressed in ill-fitting clothes. Mat left.</p>

<p>Egeanin was leaning on one hand against the side of the wagon, her head
hanging. Her other hand was gripping the necklace around her throat. Harnan
moved, a little way off in the darkness, just to show he was still there. A
wise man, to keep clear of Egeanin just then. Mat was too irritated for wisdom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was that about?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to
go on your knees to Tuon anymore. And Selucia? She&rsquo;s a bloody lady&rsquo;s maid! I
don&rsquo;t know anybody who&rsquo;d jump for his queen the way you jumped for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egeanin&rsquo;s hard face was shadowed, but her voice was
haggard. &ldquo;The High Lady is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;who she is. Selucia is her <em>so&rsquo;jhin.</em> No
one of the low Blood would dare meet her <em>so&rsquo;jhin</em>&rsquo;s eyes, and maybe not
the High Blood, either.&rdquo; The clasp broke with a metallic snap as she jerked the
necklace free. &ldquo;But then, I&rsquo;m not of any Blood, now.&rdquo; Rearing back, she put her
whole body into throwing the necklace as far into the night as she could.</p>

<p>Mat opened his mouth. He could have bought a dozen
prime horses with what he paid for that thing and had coin left. He closed it
again without saying a word. He might not always be wise, but he was wise
enough to know when a woman really might try to stick a knife in him. He knew
another thing, as well. If Egeanin behaved this way around Tuon and Selucia,
then he had better make sure the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> were kept clear. The Light only
knew what <em>they</em> would do if Tuon started wiggling her fingers.</p>

<p>That left him with a job of work to do. Well, he hated work, but those
old memories had his head stuffed full of battles. He hated battle, too&mdash;a man
could get killed dead!&mdash;but it was better than work. Strategy and tactics. Learn
the ground, learn your enemy, and if you could not win one way, you found
another.</p>

<p>The next night he returned to the purple wagon, alone, and once Olver
had finished his lesson in stones from Tuon, Mat inveigled his way into a
game. At first, sitting on the floor across the board from the dark little
woman, he was not sure whether to win or lose. Some women liked to win every
time, but the man had to make her work for it. Some liked the man to win, or at
least more often than he lost. Neither made any sense to him&mdash;he liked to win,
and the easier, the better&mdash;but that was how it was. While he was dithering,
Tuon took matters out of his hands. Halfway through the game, he realized she
had him in a trap he could not get out of. Her white stones were cutting off
his black everywhere. It was a clean and resounding win for her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t play very well, Toy,&rdquo; she said mockingly. Despite the tone,
her big, liquid eyes considered him coolly, weighing and measuring. A man could
drown in eyes like that.</p>

<p>He smiled and made his goodbyes before there could be
any thought of kicking him out. Strategy. Think to the future. Do the
unexpected. The next night, he brought a small red paper flower made by one of
the show&rsquo;s seamstresses. And presented it to a startled Selucia. Setalle&rsquo;s
eyebrows rose, and even Tuon seemed taken aback. Tactics. Put your opponent off
balance. Come to think, women and battles were not that different. Both wrapped
a man in fog and could him kill him without trying. If he was careless.</p>

<p>Every night he visited the purple wagon for a game of stones under
Setalle and Selucia&rsquo;s watchful eyes, and he concentrated on the crosshatched
board. Tuon was very good, and it was all too easy to find himself watching the
way she placed her stones, with her fingers bent back in a curiously graceful
way. She was used to having fingernails an inch long and taking care not to
break them. Her eyes were a danger, too. You needed a clear head in stones or
battle, and her gaze seemed to reach inside his skull. He buckled down to the
game, though, and managed to win four of the next seven, with one draw. Tuon
was satisfied when she won and determined when she lost, with none of the
temper tantrums he had feared, no scathing comments aside from insisting on
calling him Toy, not very much of that icy regal hauteur, as long as they were
playing anyway. She purely enjoyed the game, laughing exultantly when she
pulled him into a trap, laughing in delight when he managed a clever placement
to escape. She seemed a different woman once she lost herself in the stones
board.</p>

<p>A flower sewn from blue linen followed the paper
blossom, and two days later, a pink silk bloom that spread out as wide as a
woman&rsquo;s palm. Both handed to Selucia. Her blue eyes increasingly set in a
suspicious frown when they rested on him, but Tuon told her she could keep the
flowers, and she stored them away carefully, folded in a linen cloth. He let
three days pass without a present, then brought a little cluster of red silk
rosebuds, complete with short stems and glistening leaves that looked as real
as nature, only more perfect. He had asked the seamstress to make it on the day
he bought that first paper flower.</p>

<p>Selucia took a step, reaching to accept the rosebuds
with a curl to her lip, but he sat down and put the flowers beside the board, a
little toward Tuon. He said nothing, just left it lying there. She never so
much as glanced at it. Dipping into the small leather bags that held the
stones, he plucked one from each and shuffled them between his hands till even
he was unsure which was where, then offered his closed fists. Tuon hesitated a
moment, studying his face with no expression, then tapped his left hand. He
opened it to display the glistening white stone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve changed my mind, Toy,&rdquo; she murmured, placing the white stone
carefully on the intersection of two lines near the center of the board. &ldquo;You
play very well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat blinked. Could she know what he was up to? Selucia
was standing at Tuon&rsquo;s back, seemingly absorbed in the almost empty board.
Setaile turned a page in her book and shifted a little to get a better light.
Of course not. She was talking about stones. If she even suspected his real
game, she would toss him out on his ear. Any woman would. It had to be the
stones.</p>

<p>That was the night they played to a draw, with each of them controlling
half the board in irregular pools and patches. In truth, she won a victory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have kept my word, Toy,&rdquo; she drawled as he was
replacing the stones in the bags. &ldquo;No attempts to escape, no attempts at
betrayal. This is confining.&rdquo; She gestured around at the interior of the wagon.
&ldquo;I wish to take walks. After dark will do. You may accompany me.&rdquo; Her eyes
touched the cluster of rosebuds, then rose to his face. &ldquo;To make sure I don&rsquo;t
run away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Setaile marked her place with a slim finger and looked
at him. Selucia stood behind Tuon and looked at him. The woman <em>had</em> kept
her word, mad as that seemed. Walks after dark, with most of the showfolk
already in their beds, would do no harm, not with him there to
make sure. So why did he feel that he was losing control of the
situation?</p>

<p>Tuon agreed to go cloaked and hooded, which was something of a relief. The black
hair was growing back in on her shaved scalp, but so far it was little more
than long fuzz, and unlike Selucia, who very likely slept in her head scarf,
Tuon had shown no inclination to cover her head. A child-sized woman with hair
shorter than any man not going bald would have been remarked even in the night.
Setalle and Selucia always followed at a little distance in the darkness, the
lady&rsquo;s maid to keep a protective eye on her mistress and Setalle to keep an eye
on the maid. At least, he thought that was how it was. Sometimes it seemed they
were both watching him. The two of them were awfully friendly for guard and
prisoner. He had overheard Setalle cautioning Selucia that he was a rogue with
women, a fine thing for her to be saying! And Selucia had calmly replied that
her lady would break his arms if he showed any disrespect, just as if they were
not prisoners at all.</p>

<p>He
thought to use these walks to learn a little more about Tuon&mdash;she did not talk
much over a stones board&mdash;but she had a way of ignoring what he asked or
deflecting the subject, usually to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The
Two Rivers is all forests and farms,&rdquo; he said as they strolled along the main
street of the show. Clouds hid the moon, and the colorful wagons were
indistinguishable dark shapes, the performers&rsquo; platforms lining the street
merely shadows. &ldquo;Everybody grows tabac and raises sheep. My father breeds
cows, too, and trades horses, but mostly, it&rsquo;s tabac and sheep from one end to
the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your
father trades horses,&rdquo; Tuon murmured. &ldquo;And what do you do, Toy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He glanced
over his shoulder at the two women ghosting along ten paces back. Setalle might
not be close enough to hear, if he kept his voice down, but he decided to be
honest. Besides, the show was dead quiet in the darkness. She might hear, and
she knew what he had been doing in Ebou Dar. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a gambler,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My
father called himself a gambler,&rdquo; Tuon said softly. &ldquo;He died of a bad wager.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And how were you supposed to find out what <em>that</em> meant?</p>

<p>Another night, walking along a row of animal cages,
each one built to fill an entire wagon, he said, &ldquo;What do you do for fun, Tuon?
Just because you enjoy it. Aside from playing stones.&rdquo; He could almost feel
Selucia bristling at his use of her name from thirty feet away, but Tuon did
not seem to mind. He thought she did not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I train horses and <em>damane</em>,&rdquo; she said, peering
into a cage that held a sleeping lion. The animal was only a large shadow lying
on the straw behind the thick bars. &ldquo;Does he really have a black mane? There
are no lions with black manes in all of Seanchan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She trained <em>damane?</em> For fun? Light! &ldquo;Horses? What kind of
horses?&rdquo; It might be warhorses, if she trained bloody <em>damane.</em> For fun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mistress Anan tells me you&rsquo;re a scoundrel, Toy.&rdquo; Her
voice was cool, not cold. Composed. She turned toward him, face hidden in the
shadows of her cowl. &ldquo;How many women have you kissed?&rdquo; The lion woke up and
coughed, a deep sound guaranteed to raise the hair on anyone&rsquo;s head. Tuon did
not even flinch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks like rain&rsquo;s coming again,&rdquo; he said weakly.
&ldquo;Selucia will have my hide if I get you back soaked.&rdquo; He heard her laugh
softly. What had he said that was funny?</p>

<p>There was a price to pay, of course. Maybe things were going his way and
maybe not, but when you thought they were, there was always a price.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bunch of chattering magpies,&rdquo; he complained to
Egeanin. The afternoon sat on the horizon, a red-gold ball half hidden by
clouds, casting the show in long shadows. There was no rain, for once, and in
spite of the cold they were sitting hunched beneath the green wagon they
shared, playing stones in plain sight of anyone who walked by. A good many
did, men hurrying about some last-minute chore, children snatching the final
chance to roll hoops through the mud puddles and toss balls before night fell.
Women holding their skirts up glanced at the wagon in passing, and even when
they were hooded, Mat knew what their expressions were. Hardly a woman in the
show would speak to Mat Cauthon. Irritably, he rattled the black stones he
held gathered in his left hand. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll get their gold when we reach Lugard.
That&rsquo;s all they ought to care about. They shouldn&rsquo;t be poking their noses into
my business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can hardly blame them,&rdquo; Egeanin drawled, studying the board. &ldquo;You
and I are supposed to be fleeing lovers, but you spend more time with&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;than with me.&rdquo; She still had trouble not calling Tuon High Lady. &ldquo;You
behave like a man courting.&rdquo; She reached to place her stone, then stopped with
her hand above the board. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll complete the ceremony, can
you? You can&rsquo;t be that big a fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What ceremony? What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You named her your wife three times that night in Ebou Dar,&rdquo; she said
slowly. &ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t know? A woman says three times that a man is her
husband, and he says three times she&rsquo;s his wife, and they&rsquo;re married. There are
blessings involved, usually, but it&rsquo;s saying it in front of witnesses that
makes it a marriage. You <em>really</em> didn&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat laughed, and shrugged his shoulders, feeling the
knife hanging behind his neck. A good knife gave a man a feeling of comfort.
But his laugh was hoarse. &ldquo;But she didn&rsquo;t say anything.&rdquo; He had bloody well
been stuffing a gag in her mouth at the time! &ldquo;So whatever I said, it doesn&rsquo;t
mean anything.&rdquo; But he knew what Egeanin was going to say. Sure as water was
wet, he knew. He had been told who he was going to marry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With the Blood, it&rsquo;s a little different. Sometimes a noble from one end
of the Empire marries a noble from the other. An arranged marriage. The
Imperial family never has any other kind. They may not want to wait until they
can be together, so one acknowledges the marriage where she is, and the other
where he is. As long as they both speak in front of witnesses, inside a year
and a day, the marriage is legal. You truly didn&rsquo;t <em>know?</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sure was sure, but the stones still spilled from his
hand onto the board, bouncing everywhere. The bloody <em>girl</em> knew. Maybe
she thought this whole thing was an adventure, or a game. Maybe she thought
being kidnapped was as much fun as training horses or bloody <em>damane!</em> But
he knew he was a trout waiting for her to set the hook.</p>

<p>He stayed away from the purple wagon for two days. There was no use
running&mdash;he already had the bloody hook in his mouth, and he had put it there
himself&mdash;but he did not have to swallow the flaming thing. Only, he knew it
was just a matter of when she decided to jerk the line tight.</p>

<p>As slowly as the show moved, eventually they reached
the ferry across the Eldar, running from Alkindar on the west bank to Coramen
on the east, tidy little walled towns of tile-roofed stone buildings with half
a dozen stone docks each. The sun was climbing high, hardly a cloud crossed the
sky, and those white as new-washed wool. No rain today, maybe. It was an
important crossing, with trading ships from upriver tied to some of the docks
and big barge-like ferries crawling from one town to the other on long sweeps.
The Seanchan apparently thought so, too. They had military camps outside both
towns, and from the stone walls beginning to rise around the camps and the
stone structures going up inside, they had no intention of leaving soon.</p>

<p>Mat crossed over with the first wagons, riding Pips.
The brown gelding looked ordinary enough to an undiscerning eye; it would not
seem out of place for him to be ridden by a fellow in a rough woolen coat with
a woolen cap pulled down over his ears against the cold. He was not actually
considering making a run for the hilly wooded ridge country behind Coramen.
Thinking about it, but not really considering. She was going to set the hook
whether he ran or not. So he sat Pips at the end of one of the stone ferry
landings, watching the show cross over and trundle away through the town. There
were Seanchan on the landings, a squad of beefy men in segmented armor painted
blue and burnt gold under a lean young officer with one thin blue plume on his
odd-looking helmet. They seemed to be there just to keep order, but the officer
checked Luca&rsquo;s horse warrant, and Luca inquired whether the noble lord might
know of ground outside the town suitable for his show to perform. Mat could
have wept. He could see soldiers wearing striped armor in the street behind
him, wandering in and out of shops and taverns. A <em>raken</em> swooped down out
of the sky on long, ribbed wings, alighting outside one of the camps across the
river. Three or four of the snake-necked creatures were already on the ground.
There had to be hundreds of soldiers in those camps. Maybe a thousand. And Luca
was going to put on his show.</p>

<p>Then one of the ferries hit the rope-padded bumpers at
the end of the landing, and the ramp came down to let the windowless purple
wagon rumble off onto the stones. Setalle was driving. Selucia sat on one side
of her, peering out from the hood of a faded red cloak. On the other side,
swathed in a dark cloak so not an inch of her showed, was Tuon.</p>

<p>Mat thought his eyes were going to fall out of his
head. If his heart did not pound its way out of his chest first. The dice had
started up in his head, that rattling feel of dice rolling across a table. They
were going to come up the Dark One&rsquo;s eyes, this time; he just knew it.</p>

<p>There was nothing to do except fall in beside the
purple wagon, though, riding along as though life were wonderful, riding along
the wide main street through criers for shops and hawkers selling things from
trays. And Seanchan soldiers. They were not marching in formation now, and they
eyed the brightly painted wagons with interest. Riding along and waiting for
Tuon to shout. She had given her word, but a prisoner would say anything to get
the shackles loosened. All she had to do was raise her voice, and summon a
thousand Seanchan soldiers for rescue. The dice bounced and spun in Mat&rsquo;s head.
Riding along, waiting for the Dark One&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>Tuon never spoke a word. She peeked curiously past the edge of her deep
cowl, curiously and cautiously, but she kept her face hidden, and even her
hands, all wrapped in that dark cloak and even huddling against Setalle like a
child seeking the protection of her mother in a strange crowd. Never a word
until they had passed the gates of Coramen and were rumbling toward the base of
the ridge that rose behind the town, where Luca was already gathering the
show&rsquo;s wagons. That was when Mat really knew there was no escape for him. She
was going to set the hook all right. She was just biding her bloody time.</p>

<p>He made sure all the Seanchan stayed in their wagons
that night, and the Aes Sedai, too. Nobody had seen any <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> or <em>damane</em>
that Mat knew, but the Aes Sedai did not argue for once. Tuon did not
argue, either. She made a demand that sent Setalle&rsquo;s eyebrows almost to her
hairline. It was phrased as a request, in a way, a reminder of a promise he had
made, but he knew a demand when a woman made one. Well, a man had to trust the
woman he was going to marry. He told her he had to think on it,
just so she would not start imagining she could have anything she wanted out of
him. He thought on it all the day that Luca put on his show, thinking and
sweating while as many Seanchan as not came to gape at the performers. He
thought on it while the wagons wound eastward through the hills, moving slower
than ever, but he knew what answer he had to give.</p>

<p>On
the third day after leaving the river, they reached the salt town of Jurador,
and he told Tuon that he would. She smiled at him, and the dice in his head
stopped dead. He would always remember that. She smiled, and <em>then</em> the
dice stopped. A man could weep!</p>
