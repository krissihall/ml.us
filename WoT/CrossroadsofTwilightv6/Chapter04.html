<h4><em>The Tale of a Doll</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">F</span>uryk Karede sat staring at his writing table without
 seeing the papers and maps spread out in front of him. Both of his oil lamps
 were lit and sitting on the table, but he no longer had need of them. The sun
 must be rimming the horizon, yet since waking from a fitful sleep and saying
 his devotions to the Empress, might she live forever, he had only donned his
 robe, in the dark Imperial green that some insisted on calling black, and sat
 here without moving since. He had not even shaved. The rain had stopped, and
 he considered telling his servant Ajimbura to swing a window open for a
 little fresh air in his room at The Wandering Woman. Clean air might clear
 his head. But over the last five days there had been lulls in the rain that
 ended with sudden drenching downpours, and his bed was located between the
 windows. He had needed to have his mattress and bedding hung in the kitchen
 to dry once already.</p>

<p>A tiny squeal and a pleased grunt from Ajimbura made him look up to find
the wiry little man displaying a limp rat half the size of a cat on the end of
his long knife. It was not the first Ajimbura had killed in this room
recently, something Karede believed would not have happened if Setalle Anan
still owned the inn, though the number of rats in Ebou Dar seemed to be
increasing well in advance of spring. Ajimbura looked a little like a wizened
rat himself, his grin both satisfied and feral. After more than three hundred
years under the Empire, the Kaensada hill tribes were only half civilized, and
less than half tamed. The man wore his white-streaked dark red hair in a thick
braid that hung to his waist, to make a good trophy if he ever found his way
back to those near-mountains and fell in one of the endless feuds between families
or tribes, and he insisted on drinking from a silver-mounted cup that anyone
who looked closely could see was the top of someone&rsquo;s skull.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are going to eat that,&rdquo; Karede said as though
there were any question, &ldquo;you will clean it in the stableyard out of anyone&rsquo;s
sight.&rdquo; Ajimbura would eat anything except for lizards, which were forbidden to
his tribe for some reason he would never make clear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But of course, high one,&rdquo; the man replied with the hunch of his
shoulders that passed for a bow among his people. &ldquo;I know well the ways of the
townspeople, and I would not embarrass the high one.&rdquo; After close to twenty
years in Karede&rsquo;s service, without a reminder he still would have skinned out
the rat and roasted it over the flames in the small brick fireplace.</p>

<p>Scraping the carcass off the blade into a small canvas
sack, Ajimbura tucked that into a corner for later and carefully wiped his
knife clean before sheathing it and settling on his heels to await Karede&rsquo;s
needs. He would wait like that all day, if necessary, as patiently as a <em>da&rsquo;covale.</em>
Karede had never puzzled out exactly why Ajimbura had left his hill fort
home to follow one of the Deathwatch Guard. It was a much more circumscribed
life than the man had known before, and besides, Karede had nearly killed him
three times before he made that choice.</p>

<p>Dismissing thoughts of his servant, he returned to the
display on his writing table, though he had no intention of taking up his pen
for the moment. He had been raised to banner-general for achieving some small
success in the battles with the Asha&rsquo;man, in days when few had achieved any,
and now, because he had commanded against men who could channel, some thought
he must have wisdom to share about fighting <em>marath&rsquo;damane.</em> No one had had
to do that in centuries, and since the so-called Aes Sedai revealed their
unknown weapon only a few leagues from where he sat, a great deal of thinking
had gone into how to cripple their power. That was not the only request
littering the tabletop. Aside from the usual run of requisitions and reports
that needed his signature, his comments on the forces arrayed against them in
Illian had been solicited by four lords and three ladies, and on the special
Aiel problem by six ladies and five lords, but those questions would be decided
elsewhere, very likely already had been decided. His observations would only be
used in the infighting over who controlled what in the Return. In any event,
war had always been a second calling for the Deathwatch Guard. Oh, the Guards
were always there whenever a major battle was fought, the swordhand of the
Empress, might she live forever, to strike at her enemies whether or not she
herself was present, always to lead the way where the fight was hottest, but
their first calling was to protect the lives and persons of the Imperial
family. With their own lives, when necessary, and willingly given. And nine
nights past, the High Lady Tuon had vanished as if swallowed by the storm. He
did not think of her as the Daughter of the Nine Moons, could not until he knew
she was no longer under the veil.</p>

<p>He had not considered taking his own life, either, though the shame cut
him keenly. It was for the Blood to resort to the easy way to escape disgrace;
the Deathwatch Guard fought to the last. Musenge commanded her personal
bodyguard, but as the highest-ranking member of the Guard this side of the
Aryth Ocean, it was Karede&rsquo;s duty to return her safely. Every cranny in the
city was being searched on one excuse or another, every vessel larger than a
rowboat, but most often by men ignorant of what they were searching for,
unaware that the fate of the Return might rest on their diligence. The duty was
his. Of course, the Imperial family was given to even more complicated
intrigues than the rest of the Blood, and the High Lady Tuon frequently played
a very deep game indeed, with a sharp and deadly skill. Only a few were aware
that she had vanished twice before, and had been reported dead, to the very
arrangement of her funeral rites, all by her own contriving. Whatever the
reasons for her disappearance, though, he had to find and protect her. So far
he had no clue how. Swallowed by the storm. Or perhaps by the Lady of the
Shadows. There had been countless attempts to kidnap or assassinate her,
beginning on the day of her birth. If he found her dead, he must find who had
killed her, who had given the ultimate commands, and avenge her whatever the
cost. That was his duty, too.</p>

<p>A slender man slipped into the room from the hallway
without knocking. He might have been one of the inn&rsquo;s stablemen from his rough
coat, but no local had his pale hair or the blue eyes that slid across the room
as though memorizing everything in it. His hand slipped under his coat, and
Karede rehearsed two ways of killing him barehanded in the brief moment before
he produced a small, gold-bordered ivory plaque worked with the Raven and the
Tower. Seekers for Truth did not have to knock. Killing them was frowned upon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave us,&rdquo; the Seeker told Ajimbura, tucking away the
plaque once he was sure Karede had recognized it. The little man remained
crouched on his heels, motionless, and the Seeker&rsquo;s eyebrows rose in surprise.
Even in the Kaensada Hills everyone knew a Seeker&rsquo;s word was law. Well, perhaps
not in some of the more remote hill forts, not if they believed no one knew the
Seeker was there, but Ajimbura knew better than this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait outside,&rdquo; Karede commanded sharply, and Ajimbura
rose with alacrity, murmuring, &ldquo;I hear and obey, high one.&rdquo; He studied the
Seeker openly, though, as if to make sure the Seeker knew he had marked his
face, before leaving the room. He was going to get himself beheaded, one day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A precious thing, loyalty,&rdquo; the pale-haired man said,
eyeing the tabletop, after Ajimbura pulled the door shut behind himself. &ldquo;You
are involved in Lord Yulan&rsquo;s plans, Banner-General Karede? I would not have
expected the Deathwatch Guard to be part of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Karede moved two bronze map-weights shaped like lions
and let the map of Tar Valon roll up on itself. The other had not been
unrolled, yet. &ldquo;You must ask Lord Yulan, Seeker. Loyalty to the Crystal Throne
is precious above the breath of life, followed closely by knowing when to keep
silent. The more who speak of a thing, the more will learn of it who should
not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one short of the Imperial family rebuked a Seeker
or whatever Hand guided him, but the fellow appeared unaffected. Then again, he
seated himself in the room&rsquo;s cushioned armchair and made a tent of his ringers,
peering over them at Karede, who had the choice of moving his own chair or
leaving the man almost at his back. Most people would have been very nervous
about having a Seeker behind them. Most would have been nervous having a Seeker
in the same room. Karede hid a smile and did not move. He had only to turn his
head a fraction, and he was trained at seeing clearly what lay in the corners
of sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be proud of your sons,&rdquo; the Seeker said,
&ldquo;two following you into the Deathwatch Guard, the third listed among the
honored dead. Your wife would have been very proud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your name, Seeker?&rdquo; The answering silence was
deafening. More people rebuked Seekers than inquired after their names.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mor,&rdquo; the reply came finally. &ldquo;Almurat Mor.&rdquo; So. Mor. He had an
ancestor who had come with Luthair Paendrag, then, and was rightly proud.
Without access to the breeding books, which no <em>da&rsquo;covale</em> was allowed,
Karede had no way of knowing whether any of the tales about his own ancestry
were true&mdash;he also might have an ancestor who had once followed the great
Hawkwing&mdash;but it did not matter. Men who tried to stand on their forebears&rsquo;
shoulders rather than their own feet often found themselves shorter by a head.
Especially <em>da&rsquo;covale.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Call me Furyk. We are both the property of the
Crystal Throne. What do you want of me, Almurat? Not to discuss my family, I
think.&rdquo; If his sons were in trouble, the fellow would never have mentioned them
so soon, and Kalia was beyond any misery. From the corner of his eye, Karede
could see the struggle on the Seeker&rsquo;s face, though he hid it almost well
enough. The man had lost control of the interview&mdash;as he might have expected,
flashing his plaque as though a Deathwatch Guard were not ready to thrust a
dagger into his own heart on command.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen to a story,&rdquo; Mor said slowly, &ldquo;and tell me
what you think.&rdquo; His gaze was fastened to Karede as if by tacks, studying,
weighing, evaluating as though Karede were on the block at sale. &ldquo;This came to
us in the last few days.&rdquo; By us, he meant the Seekers. &ldquo;It began among the
local people, as near as we can tell, though we have not yet found the original
source. Supposedly, a girl with a Seandar accent has been extorting gold and
jewelry from merchants here in Ebou Dar. The title Daughter of the Nine Moons
was mentioned.&rdquo; He grimaced with disgust, and for a moment, his fingertips
turned white, they were pressing against each other so hard. &ldquo;None of the
locals seem to understand what that title means, but the description of the
girl is remarkably precise. Remarkably accurate. And no one can recall hearing
this rumor before the night after&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the night after Tylin&rsquo;s murder was discovered,&rdquo;
he finished, choosing the least unpleasant event to fix the time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Seandar accent,&rdquo; Karede said in a flat voice, and
Mor nodded. &ldquo;This rumor has passed to our own people.&rdquo; That was not a
question, but Mor nodded again. A Seandar accent and an accurate description,
two things no local could invent. Someone was playing a very dangerous game.
Dangerous for themselves, and for the Empire. &ldquo;How does the Tarasin Palace take
recent events?&rdquo; There would be Listeners among the servants, likely among even
the Ebou Dari servants by now, and what the Listeners heard soon passed to the
Seekers.</p>

<p>Mor understood the question, of course. There was no need to mention
what should not be mentioned. He replied in an indifferent tone. &ldquo;The High
Lady Tuon&rsquo;s entourage carries on as though nothing has happened, except that
Anath, her Truth Speaker, has taken to seclusion, but I am told that is not
unusual for her. Suroth herself is even more distraught in private than in
public. She sleeps poorly, snaps at her favorites, and has her property beaten
over trifles. She ordered the death of one Seeker each day until matters are
rectified, and only rescinded the order this morning, when she realized she
might run out of Seekers before she ran out of days.&rdquo; His shoulders moved in a
small shrug, perhaps to indicate this was all in a day for Seekers, perhaps in
relief at a near escape. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s understandable. If she is called to account,
she will pray for the Death of Ten Thousand Tears. The other Blood who know
what has happened are trying to grow eyes in the backs of their heads. A few
have even quietly made funeral arrangements, to cover any eventuality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Karede wanted a clearer look at the man&rsquo;s face. He was inured to insult&mdash;that was part of the training&mdash;but this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Pushing back his chair, he
stood and sat at the edge of the writing table. Mor stared at him unblinking,
tensed to defend against an attack, and Karede drew a deep breath to still his
anger. &ldquo;Why did you come to me if you believe the Deathwatch Guards are
implicated in this?&rdquo; The effort of keeping his voice level almost strangled
him. Since the first Deathwatch Guards swore on the corpse of Luthair Paendrag
to defend his son, there had never been treason among the Guards! Never!</p>

<p>Mor relaxed by increments as he realized that Karede
did not intend to kill him, at least not right then, but there was a haze of
sweat on his forehead. &ldquo;I have heard it said a Deathwatch Guard can see a butterfly&rsquo;s
breath. Do you have anything to drink?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Karede gestured curtly to the brick hearth, where a
silver cup and pitcher sat near the flames, to keep warm. They had been there,
untouched, since Ajimbura brought them when Karede awoke. &ldquo;The wine may be cool
by now, but be free of it. And when your throat is wet, you will answer my
question. Either you suspect Guardsmen, or you wish to play me in some game of
your own, and by my eyes, I will know which, and why.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fellow sidled to the hearth, watching him from the corner of his
eye, but as Mor bent for the pitcher, he frowned and then gave a small start.
What appeared to be a silver-rimmed bowl with a ram&rsquo;s-horn-patterned silver
base sat beside the cup. Light of heaven, Ajimbura had been told often enough
to keep that thing out of sight! There was no doubt that Mor recognized it for
what it was.</p>

<p>The man considered treason possible for the Guards?
&ldquo;Pour for me as well, if you will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mor blinked, showing a faint consternation&mdash;he held the only obvious
cup&mdash;and then a light of understanding appeared in his eyes. An uneasy light.
He filled the bowl, too, a trifle unsteadily, and wiped his hand on his coat
before taking it up. Every man had his limits, even a Seeker, and a man pushed
to them was especially dangerous, but he was also off balance.</p>

<p>Accepting the skull-cup with both hands, Karede raised it high and
lowered his head. &ldquo;To the Empress, may she live forever in honor and glory.
Death and shame to her enemies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the Empress, may she live forever in honor and glory,&rdquo; Mor
echoed, bowing his head and lifting his cup. &ldquo;Death and shame to her enemies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Putting Ajimbura&rsquo;s cup to his lips, Karede was aware of the other man
watching him drink. The wine was indeed cool, the spices bitter, and there was
a faint, acrid hint of silver polish; he told himself the taste of dead man&rsquo;s
dust was his imagination.</p>

<p>Mor dashed off half his own wine in hurried gulps, then stared at his
cup, seemed to realize what he had done, and made a visible effort to regain
control of himself. &ldquo;Furyk Karede,&rdquo; he said briskly. &ldquo;Born forty-two years ago
to weavers, the property of one Jalid Magonine, a craftsman in Ancarid. Chosen
at fifteen for training in the Deathwatch Guards. Cited twice for heroism and
mentioned in dispatches three times, then, as a seven-year veteran, named to
the bodyguard of the High Lady Tuon upon her birth.&rdquo; That had not been her name
then, of course, but mentioning her birth-name would have been an insult. &ldquo;That
same year, as one of three survivors of the first known attempt on her life,
chosen for training as an officer. Service during the Muyami Uprising and the
Jianmin Incident, more citations for heroism, more mentions in dispatches, and
assignment back to the High Lady&rsquo;s bodyguard just before her first true-name
day.&rdquo; Mor peered into his wine, then looked up suddenly. &ldquo;At your request.
Unusual, that. The following year, you took three serious wounds shielding her
with your body against another set of assassins. She gave you her most precious
possession, a doll. After more distinguished service, with further citations
and mentions, you were selected for the bodyguard of the Empress herself, may
she live forever, and served there until named to accompany the High Lord
Turak to these lands with the <em>Hailene.</em> Times change, and men change, but
before going to guard the throne, you made two other requests for assignment to
the High Lady Tuon&rsquo;s bodyguard. <em>Most</em> unusual. And you kept the doll
until it was destroyed in the Great Fire of Sohima, a matter of ten years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not for the first time, Karede was glad of the
training that allowed him to maintain a smooth face no matter what. Careless
expressions gave away too much to an opponent. He remembered the face of the
small girl who had laid that doll on his litter. He could hear her still. <em>You
have protected my life, so you must take Emela to watch over you in turn</em>, she
said. <em>She can&rsquo;t really protect you, of course; she&rsquo;s only a doll. But keep
her to remind you that I will always hear if you speak my name. If I&rsquo;m still
alive, of course.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;My honor is
loyalty,&rdquo; he said, setting Ajimbura&rsquo;s cup on the writing table carefully, so as
not to slop wine onto his papers. However often the fellow polished the silver,
Karede did not think he bothered to wash the thing. &ldquo;Loyalty to the throne. Why
did you come to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mor
moved slightly, so the armchair was between them. No doubt he thought he was
standing casually, but he was clearly ready to throw the winecup. He had a
knife under his coat in the small of his back, and probably at least one other.
&ldquo;Three requests to join the High Lady Tuon&rsquo;s bodyguard. And you kept the doll.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That
much, I understand,&rdquo; Karede told him dryly. The Guards were not supposed to
form attachments to those they were sent to guard. The Deathwatch Guard served
only the Crystal Throne, served <em>whoever</em> succeeded to the throne, with a
whole heart and a whole faith. But he remembered that serious child&rsquo;s face,
already aware she might not live to do her duty yet trying to do it anyway, and
he had kept the doll. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s more to it than rumor of a girl, isn&rsquo;t
there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A
butterfly&rsquo;s breath,&rdquo; the fellow murmured. &ldquo;It is a pleasure to talk to someone
who sees deeply. On the night that Tylin was murdered, two <em>damane</em> were
taken from the Tarasin Palace kennels. Both were formerly Aes Sedai. Do you not
find the coincidence too much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I
find any coincidence suspect, Almurat. But what has that to do with rumors and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;other matters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This
web is more tangled than you imagine. Several others left the palace that
night, among them a young man who was apparently Tylin&rsquo;s pet, four men who
were certainly soldiers, and an older man, one Thom Merrilin, or so he called
himself, who was supposedly a servant, but who displayed much more education
than would be expected. At one time or another, they were all seen with Aes
Sedai who were in the city before the Empire reclaimed it.&rdquo; Intent, the Seeker
leaned forward slightly over the back of the armchair. &ldquo;Perhaps Tylin was not
murdered because she swore fealty, but because she had learned of things that
were dangerous. She might have been careless
in what she revealed to the boy on the pillows, and he carried word to
Merrilin. We can call him that until we learn a better name. The more I learn
of that one, the more intriguing he is: knowledgeable of the world,
well-spoken, at ease with nobles and crowns. A courtier, in fact, if you didn&rsquo;t
know he was a servant. If the White Tower had certain plans in Ebou Dar, they
might send such a man to carry them out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Plans. Unthinking, Karede picked up Ajimbura&rsquo;s cup and
almost drank before he realized what he was doing. He continued to hold the
cup, though, so as not to give away his turmoil. Everyone&mdash;those who knew,
anyway&mdash;was sure the High Lady Tuon&rsquo;s disappearance was part of the contest to
succeed the Empress, might she live forever. Such was life in the Imperial
family. If the High Lady were dead, after all, a new heir must be named. If she
were dead. And if not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The White Tower would have sent their best, if
they planned to carry her away. If the Seeker was not playing him in some game
of his own. Seekers could try to snare anyone short of the Empress herself,
might she live forever. &ldquo;You have taken this notion to your superiors, and they
rejected it, or you would not come to me. That, or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;You haven&rsquo;t mentioned
it to them, have you? Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much more tangled than you can imagine,&rdquo; Mor said softly, eyeing the
door as if suspecting eavesdroppers. Why did he grow cautious now? &ldquo;There are
many&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;complications. The two <em>damane</em> were removed by the Lady
Egeanin Tamarath, who has had dealings with Aes Sedai before. Close dealings,
in fact. Very close. Clearly, she released the other <em>damane</em> to cover her
escape. Egeanin left the city that same night, with three <em>damane</em> in her
entourage, and also, we believe, Merrilin and the others. We don&rsquo;t know who the
third <em>damane</em> was&mdash;we suspect someone important among the Atha&rsquo;an Miere,
or perhaps an Aes Sedai who was hiding in the city&mdash;but we have identified the
<em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> she used, and two have close connections with Suroth. Who
herself has many connections to Aes Sedai.&rdquo; For all his wariness, Mor said that
as if it were not a lightning bolt. No wonder he was on edge.</p>

<p>So. Suroth plotted with Aes Sedai and had corrupted at least some of the
Seekers above Mor, and the White Tower had placed men under one of their best
to carry out certain actions. It was all believable.
When Karede was sent with the Forerunners, he had been tasked to watch the
Blood for over-ambition. There had always been a possibility, this far from the
Empire, that they would try to set up their own kingdoms. And he himself had
sent men into a city he knew would fall whatever was done to defend it, so they
could harm the enemy from within.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a
direction, Almurat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mor shook
his head. &ldquo;They went north, and Jehannah was mentioned in the palace stables,
but that seems an obvious attempt at deception. They will have changed
direction at the first opportunity. We have checked on boats large enough to
have carried the party across the river, but vessels of that size come and go
all the time. There is no order in this place, no control.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This gives
me a great deal to think on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Seeker
grimaced, a slight twisting of his mouth, but he seemed to realize he had
gotten as much commitment as Karede would make. He nodded once. &ldquo;Whatever you
choose to do, you should know this. You may wonder how the girl extorted
anything from these merchants. It seems two or three soldiers always accompanied
her. The description of their armor was also very precise.&rdquo; He half stretched
out a hand as though to touch Karede&rsquo;s robe, but wisely let it fall back to his
side. &ldquo;Most people call that black. You understand me? Whatever you choose to
do, do not delay.&rdquo; Mor raised his cup. &ldquo;Your health, Banner-General. Furyk.
Your health, and the health of the Empire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Karede
drained Ajimbura&rsquo;s cup without hesitation.</p>

<p>The
Seeker departed as abruptly as he had entered, and moments after the door
closed behind him, it opened to admit Ajimbura. The little man stared
accusingly at the skull-cup in Karede&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know
this rumor, Ajimbura?&rdquo; As well ask whether the sun rose in the morning as ask
whether the fellow had been listening. He did not deny it, in any case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not
soil my tongue with such filth, high one,&rdquo; he said, drawing himself up.</p>

<p>Karede
permitted himself a sigh. Whether the High Lady Tuon&rsquo;s disappearance was her
own doing or some other&rsquo;s, she was in great danger. And if the rumor was some
ploy by Mor, the best way to defeat
another&rsquo;s game was to make the game your own. &ldquo;Lay out my razor.&rdquo; Sitting down,
he reached for his pen, holding the sleeve of his robe clear of the ink with
his left hand. &ldquo;Then you will find Captain Musenge, when he is alone, and give
him this. Return quickly; I will have more instructions for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shortly after noon on the following day, he was
crossing the harbor on the ferry that departed each hour, according to the
strict ringing of bells. It was a lumbering barge that heaved as long sweeps
propelled it across the harbor&rsquo;s choppy surface. The ropes lashing a merchant&rsquo;s
half-dozen canvas-covered wagons to the cleats on the deck creaked with every
shift, the horses stamped their hooves nervously, and the oarsmen had to fend
off wagon drivers and hired guards who wanted to empty their bellies over the
side. Some men had no stomach for the motion of water. The merchant herself, a
plump-faced woman with a coppery skin, stood in the bow wrapped in her dark
cloak, balancing easily with the ferry&rsquo;s movements, staring fixedly at the
approaching landing and ignoring Karede beside her. She might know that he was
Seanchan, from the saddle on his bay gelding if nothing else, but a plain gray
cloak covered his red-trimmed green coat, so if she thought of him at all, it
was as an ordinary soldier. Not a settler, with a sword on his hip. There might
have been sharper eyes back in the city, despite all he had done to evade them,
but there was nothing he could do about that. With luck, he had a day, perhaps
two, before anyone realized he would not be returning to the inn any time soon.</p>

<p>Swinging into his saddle as soon as the ferry bumped
hard against the landing dock&rsquo;s leather-padded posts, he was first off when the
loading gate swung aside, the merchant was still chivvying her drivers to the
wagons and the ferrymen unlashing wheels. He kept Aldazar to a slow walk across
the stones, still slippery with the morning&rsquo;s rain, a litter of horse dung, and
the leavings of a flock of sheep, and let the bay&rsquo;s pace increase only when he
reached the Illian Road itself, though he kept short of a trot even then.
Impatience was a vice when beginning a journey of unknown length.</p>

<p>Inns lined the road beyond the landing, flat-roofed buildings, covered
in cracked and flaking white plaster and with faded signs out
front or none at all. This road marked the northern edge of the Rahad, and
roughly dressed men slouching on benches in front of the inns sullenly watched
him pass. Not because he was Seanchan; he suspected they would have been no
brighter for anyone on horseback. Anyone who had two coins to rub, for that
matter. Soon he left them behind, though, and the next few hours took him past
olive orchards and small farms where the workers were accustomed enough to
passersby on the road that they did not look up from their labors. The traffic
was sparse in any case, a handful of high-wheeled farmers&rsquo; carts and twice a
merchant&rsquo;s train rumbling toward Ebou Dar, surrounded by hired guards. Many of
the drivers and both merchants wore those distinctive Illianer beards. It
seemed strange that Illian continued to send its trade to Ebou Dar while
fighting to resist the Empire, but people on this side of the Eastern Sea were
often peculiar, with odd customs, and little like the stories told of the great
Hawkwing&rsquo;s homeland. Often nothing like. They must be understood, of course, if
they were to be brought into the Empire, but understanding was for others,
higher than he. He had his duty.</p>

<p>The farms
gave way to woodlands and fields of scrub, and his shadow was lengthening in front
of him, the sun more than halfway to the horizon, by the time he saw what he
was looking for. Just ahead, Ajimbura was squatting on the north side of the
road, playing a reed flute, the image of an idler shirking. Before Karede
reached him, he tucked the flute behind his belt, gathered his brown cloak and
vanished into the brush and trees. Glancing behind to make sure the road was
empty in that direction as well, Karede turned Aldazar into the woodland at the
same point.</p>

<p>The
little man was waiting just out of sight of the road, among a stand of some
sort of large pine tree, the tallest easily a hundred feet. He made his
hunch-shouldered bow and scrambled into the saddle of a lean chestnut with four
white feet. He insisted that white feet on a horse were lucky. &ldquo;This way, high
one?&rdquo; he said, and at Karede&rsquo;s gesture of permission, turned his mount deeper
into the forest.</p>

<p>They had
only a short way to ride, no more than half a mile, but no one passing on the
road could have suspected what waited there in a large clearing. Musenge had
brought a hundred of the Guard on
good horses and twenty Ogier Gardeners, all in full armor, along with pack
animals to carry supplies for two weeks. The packhorse Ajimbura had brought out
yesterday, with Karede&rsquo;s armor, would be among them. A cluster of <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> were
standing beside their own mounts, some petting the six leashed <em>damane.</em> When
Musenge rode forward to meet Karede with Hartha, the First Gardener, striding
grim-faced beside him with his green-tasseled axe over his shoulder. One of the
women, Melitene, the High Lady Tuon&rsquo;s <em>der&rsquo;sul&rsquo;dam</em>, stepped into her
saddle and joined them.</p>

<p>Musenge and Hartha touched fists to heart, and Karede
returned their salute, but his eyes went to the <em>damane.</em> To one in
particular, a small woman whose hair was being stroked by a dark, square-faced <em>sul&rsquo;dam.</em>
A <em>damane&rsquo;s</em> face was always deceptive&mdash;they aged slowly and lived a
very long time&mdash;but this one had a difference he had learned to recognize as
belonging to those who called themselves Aes Sedai. &ldquo;What excuse did you use to
get all of them out of the city at once?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exercise, Banner-General,&rdquo; Melitene replied with a
wry smile. &ldquo;Everyone always believes exercise.&rdquo; It was said the High Lady Tuon
in truth needed no <em>der&rsquo;sul&rsquo;dam</em> to train her property or her <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>, but
Melitene, with less black than gray in her long hair, was experienced in more
than her craft, and she knew what he was really asking. He had requested that
Musenge bring a pair of <em>damane</em>, if he could. &ldquo;None of us would be left
behind, Banner-General. Never for this. As for Mylen&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; That must be the
former Aes Sedai. &ldquo;After we left the city, we told the <em>damane</em> why we
were going. It&rsquo;s always best if they know what&rsquo;s expected. We&rsquo;ve been calming
Mylen ever since. She loves the High Lady. They all do, but Mylen worships her
as though she already sat on the Crystal Throne. If Mylen gets her hands on
one of these &lsquo;Aes Sedai,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; she chuckled, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have to be quick to keep the
woman from being too battered to be worth leashing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see no cause for laughter,&rdquo; Hartha rumbled. The Ogier was even more
weathered and grizzled than Musenge, with long gray mustaches and eyes like
black stones staring out of his helmet. He had been a Gardener since before
Karede&rsquo;s father was born, maybe before his grandfather. &ldquo;We have no target. We
are trying to catch the wind in a net.&rdquo; Melitene sobered quickly,
and Musenge began to look grimmer than Hartha, if that was possible.</p>

<p>In ten days,
the people they sought would have put many miles behind them. The best the
White Tower could send would not be so blatant as to head due east after trying
the ruse of Jehannah, nor so stupid to as to head too close to north, yet that
left a vast and ever expanding area to be searched. &ldquo;Then we must begin spreading
our nets without delay,&rdquo; Karede said, &ldquo;and spread them finely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Musenge
and Hartha nodded. For the Deathwatch Guard, what must be done, would be done.
Even to catching the wind.</p>
