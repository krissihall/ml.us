<h4><em>What Wise Ones Know</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">H</span>alwin Norry, the First Clerk, and Reene Harfor, the
 First Maid, entered together, him making a jerky, unpracticed bow, and her a
 graceful curtsy that was neither too low nor too shallow. They could not have
 been more different. Mistress Harfor was round-faced and regally dignified,
 her hair in a neat gray bun atop her head, Master Norry tall and gawky as a
 wading-bird, with his little remaining hair sticking up behind his ears like
 sprays of white feathers. Each carried an embossed leather folder stuffed
 with papers, but she held hers at her side as if not to rumple her formal
 scarlet tabard, unwrinkled as it always seemed to be, no matter the hour or
 how long she had been on her feet, while he clutched his folder to his narrow
 chest as if to hide old inkstains, of which several spotted his tabard,
 including a large blot that made the White Lion&rsquo;s tail end in a black tuft.
 Courtesies done, they immediately put a little distance between them, each
 not quite watching the other.</p>

<p>As soon as the door closed behind Rasoria, the glow of
<em>saidar</em> sprung up around Aviendha, and she wove a ward against eavesdropping
that clung to the walls of the room. What was said between them was now as safe
as they could make it, and Aviendha would know if anyone even tried to listen
with the Power. She was very good with this sort of weave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mistress Harfor,&rdquo; Elayne said, &ldquo;if you will begin.&rdquo;
She did not offer wine or seats, of course. Master Norry would have been
shocked to his toenails by such a lapse in the proprieties, and Mistress
Harfor might well have been offended. As it was, Norry twitched and glanced
sideways at Reene, and her mouth thinned. Even after a week&rsquo;s meetings, their
dislike for giving their reports where the other could hear was palpable. They
were jealous of their fiefs, the more so since the First Maid had moved into
territory that once might have been considered Master Norry&rsquo;s responsibility.
Of course, running the Royal Palace had always been the First Maid&rsquo;s charge,
and it might be said that her new duties were only an extension of that. It
would not be said by Halwin Norry, though. The blazing logs settled in the
fireplace with a loud crack, sending a shower of sparks up the chimney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am convinced the Second Librarian is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a spy,
my Lady,&rdquo; Mistress Harfor said finally, ignoring Norry as if to make him disappear.
She had resisted letting <em>anyone</em> else know that she was searching out
spies in the palace, yet the First Clerk knowing seemed to grate on her worst
of all. His only authority over her, if such it was, came from paying the
palace accounts, and he never questioned an expenditure, but even that little
was more than she wished. &ldquo;Every three or four days Master Harnder visits an
inn called the Hoop and Arrow, supposedly for the ale made by the innkeeper,
one Millis Fendry, but Mistress Fendry also keeps pigeons, and whenever Master
Harnder visits, she sends off a pigeon that flies north. Yesterday, three of
the Aes Sedai staying at the Silver Swan found reason to visit the Hoop and
Arrow, though it caters to a much poorer crowd than the Swan. They came and
went hooded, and were closeted with Mistress Fendry in private for over an hour.
All three are Brown Ajah. I fear that indicates Master Harnder&rsquo;s employer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hairdressers, footmen, cooks, the master cabinetmaker, no fewer than
five of Master Norry&rsquo;s clerks, and now one of the librarians.&rdquo; Leaning back in
her chair and crossing her legs, Dyelin glowered sourly. &ldquo;Is there anyone we <em>won&rsquo;t</em>
eventually learn is a spy, Mistress Harfor?&rdquo; Norry stretched his neck
uncomfortably; he took the malfeasance of his clerks as a personal affront.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have hopes I may be reaching the bottom of that barrel,
my Lady,&rdquo; Mistress Harfor said complacently. Neither spies nor the High Seats
of powerful Houses ruffled her. Spies were pests she intended to rid the palace
of as surely as she kept it clear of fleas and rats&mdash;though she had been
forced to accept Aes Sedai aid with rats recently&mdash;while powerful nobles were
like rain or snow, facts of nature to be endured until they went away, but
nothing to get flustered over. &ldquo;There are only so many people who can be
bought, and only so many can afford to buy, or want to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne tried to picture Master Harnder, but all she could bring up in
her mind was vague, a chubby, balding man who blinked incessantly. He had
served her mother, and as she recalled, Queen Mordrellen before that. No one
commented on the fact that it seemed he also served the Brown Ajah. Every
ruler&rsquo;s palace between the Spine of the World and the Aryth Ocean contained the
Tower&rsquo;s eyes-and-ears. Any ruler with half a brain expected it. Doubtless the
Seanchan would soon be living under the White Tower&rsquo;s gaze, too, if they were
not already. Reene had discovered several spies for the Red Ajah, assuredly
legacies of Elaida&rsquo;s time in Caemlyn, but this librarian was the first for
another Ajah. Elaida would not have liked other Ajahs knowing what went on in
the palace while she was advisor to the Queen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pity we have no false stories we want the Brown Ajah to believe,&rdquo; she
said lightly. A <em>great</em> pity they, and the Reds, knew about the Kin. At
best, they had to know there were a large number of women in the palace who
could channel, and it would not take them long to figure out who they were.
That would create any number of problems down the road, yet those difficulties
did lie somewhere in the future. Always plan ahead, Lini used to say, but worry
too hard over next year, and you can trip over tomorrow. &ldquo;Watch Master Harnder
and try to find out his friends. That will have to suffice for the time being.&rdquo;
Some spies depended on their ears, either to hear gossip or listen at doors;
others lubricated tongues with a few friendly cups of wine. The first part of
counteracting a spy was to find out how he learned what he sold.</p>

<p>Aviendha snorted loudly and, spreading her skirts, started to sit down
on the carpet before realizing what she wore. With a warning glance at Dyelin,
she perched stiffly on the front edge of a chair instead, the picture of a
court lady with her eyes flashing. Except that a lady of the court would not
have checked the edge of her belt knife with a thumb. Left to her own devices,
Aviendha would slit every spy&rsquo;s throat as soon as it could be stretched for the
knife. Spying was a vile business, in her view, no matter how often Elayne
explained that every spy found was a tool that could be used to make her
enemies believe what she wanted.</p>

<p>Not that every spy necessarily worked for an enemy. Most of those the
First Maid had uncovered took money from more than one source, and among those
she had identified were King Roedran of Murandy, various Tairen High Lords and
Ladies, a handful of Cairhienin nobles, and a fair number of merchants. A good
many people were interested in what happened in Caemlyn, whether for its effect
on trade or other reasons. Sometimes it seemed that everyone spied on everyone
else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mistress Harfor,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t found any
eyes-and-ears for the Black Tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Like most people who heard the Black Tower mentioned, Dyelin shivered,
and took a deep drink of her wine, but Reene just grimaced faintly. She had
decided to ignore the fact that they were men who could channel, since she
could not change matters. To her, the Black Tower was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;an annoyance. &ldquo;They
haven&rsquo;t had time, my Lady. Give them a year, and you&rsquo;ll find footmen and
librarians taking their coin, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I will.&rdquo; Dreadful thought. &ldquo;What else do you have for us
today?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a word with Jon Skellit, my Lady. A man who turns his coat
once is often amenable to turning it again, and Skellit is.&rdquo; Skellit, a barber,
was in the pay of House Arawn, which for the present made him Arymilla&rsquo;s man.</p>

<p>Birgitte bit off an oath in midword&mdash;for some reason, she tried to
watch her language around Reene Harfor&mdash;and spoke in a pained voice. &ldquo;You had
a <em>word</em> with him? Without asking anyone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dyelin was under no compunctions regarding the First Maid, and she
muttered, &ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s milk in a cup!&rdquo; Elayne had never heard her
use an obscenity before. Master Norry blinked and almost dropped his folder,
and busied himself with not looking at Dyelin. The First Maid, however, merely
paused until sure she and Birgitte were done, then went on calmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The
time seemed ripe, and so did Skellit. One of the men he hands his reports to
left the city and hasn&rsquo;t returned yet, while it appears the other broke his
leg. The streets are always icy where a fire has been put out.&rdquo; She said that
so blandly, it seemed more than likely she had engineered the man&rsquo;s fall
somehow. Hard times uncovered hard talents in the most surprising people.
&ldquo;Skellit is quite agreeable to carrying his next communication out to the camps
himself. He saw a gateway made, and he won&rsquo;t have to pretend terror.&rdquo; You
would have thought she herself had been seeing merchants&rsquo; wagons rumble out of
holes in the air for her entire life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to
stop this barber keeping on running once he&rsquo;s outside the fla&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the city?&rdquo; Birgitte demanded irritably, beginning to pace in front of the fire
with her hands clasped behind her. Her heavy golden braid should have been
bristling. &ldquo;If he goes, Arawn will hire somebody else, and you&rsquo;ll have to hunt
him out all over again. Light, Arymilla must have heard of the gateways almost
as soon as she arrived, and Skellit has to know it.&rdquo; It was not the thought of
Skellit escaping that irritated her, or not only that. The mercenaries thought
they had been hired to stop soldiers, but for a few silvers they would allow
one or two to slip through the gates by night in either direction. One or two
could do no harm, as they saw matters. Birgitte did not like being reminded of
that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Greed will
stop him, my Lady,&rdquo; Mistress Harfor replied calmly. &ldquo;The thought of earning
gold from the Lady Elayne as well as from Lady Naean is enough to make the man
breathe hard. It&rsquo;s true, Lady Arymilla must already have heard of the gateways,
but that only adds credit to Skellit&rsquo;s reason for going in person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if his
greed is great enough for him to try earning still more gold by turning his
coat a third time?&rdquo; Dyelin said. &ldquo;He could cause a great deal of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;mischief, Mistress Harfor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reene&rsquo;s
tone became a little crisper. She would never step over the boundaries, but she
disliked <em>anyone</em> thinking her careless. &ldquo;Lady Naean would have him buried
under the nearest snowdrift, my Lady, as I
made certain he is aware. She has never been patient. As I am sure you are
aware. In any case, the news we get from the camps is quite sparse, to say the
least, and he might see a few things we would like to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Skellit can tell us which camp Arymilla, Elenia and Naean will be in
and when, I&rsquo;ll give him his gold with my own hand,&rdquo; Elayne said deliberately.
Elenia and Naean stayed close to Arymilla, or she kept them close, and Arymilla
was much less patient than Naean, much less willing to believe that anything
could function without her presence. She spent half of each day riding from
camp to camp, and never slept in the same two nights running, as far as anyone
could learn. &ldquo;That is the only thing he can tell us of the camps that I want to
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reene inclined her head. &ldquo;As you say, my Lady. I will see to it.&rdquo; She
too often tried not to say things straight out in front of Norry, but she gave
no sign that she had heard any reproof. Of course, Elayne was not sure she
actually would rebuke the woman openly. Mistress Harfor would continue to
perform her duties properly if she did, and she certainly would continue
hunting spies with undiminished ardor, if for no other reason than their
presence in the palace offended her, yet Elayne might find a dozen
inconveniences in every day, a dozen small discomforts that added up to misery,
and not a one that she could directly attribute to the First Maid. <em>We must
follow the steps of the dance as surely as our servants</em>, her mother had
told her once. <em>You can keep hiring new servants, and spend all your time
training them and suffering till they learn, only to find yourself back where
you started, or you can accept the rules as they do, and live comfortably
while you use your time to rule.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mistress Harfor,&rdquo; she said, for which she
received another precise curtsy. Reene Harfor was another who knew her own
worth. &ldquo;Master Norry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The heron-like man gave a start and stopped frowning
at Reene. In some ways, he saw the gateways as his, and not to be trifled
with. &ldquo;Yes, my Lady. Of course.&rdquo; His voice was a dusty monotone. &ldquo;I trust the
lady Birgitte already has informed you of the merchants&rsquo; trains from Illian and
Tear. I believe that is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;um&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;her usual custom when you return to the
city.&rdquo; For a moment, his eyes rested reproachfully on Birgitte. He would never
think of causing Elayne the smallest irritation even if she shouted at him, but
he lived by his own set of rules, and, in a mild fashion, he resented Birgitte
stealing his chance to enumerate the wagons and casks and barrels that had
arrived. He did love his numbers. At least, Elayne supposed it was in a mild
fashion. There seemed to be very little heat in Mister Norry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She did,&rdquo; she told him, with just a hint of apology,
not enough to embarrass him. &ldquo;I fear some of the Sea Folk are leaving us. We&rsquo;ll
only have half the number to make gateways after today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His fingers spidered across the leather folder against
his chest as though feeling the papers within. She had never seen him consult
one. &ldquo;Ah. Ah. We shall&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;cope, my Lady.&rdquo; Halwin Norry always coped. &ldquo;To
continue, there were nine arsons yesterday and last night, slightly more than
usual. Three attempts were made to fire warehouses storing food. None
successful, I hasten to add.&rdquo; He might hasten to add, yet he did it in that
same drone. &ldquo;If I may say so, the Guards patrolling the streets are having an
effect&mdash;the number of assaults and thefts has declined to little more than normal
for this time of year&mdash;but it seems evident that some hand is directing the
arsons. Seventeen buildings were destroyed, all save one abandoned,&rdquo; his mouth
narrowed in disapproval; it would take far more than a siege to make him leave
Caemlyn, &ldquo;and in my opinion, all of the fires were placed so as to draw the
water-wagons as far as possible from the warehouses where attempts were made. I
now believe that pattern holds for every fire we&rsquo;ve seen these past weeks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Birgitte?&rdquo; Elayne said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can try plotting the warehouses on a map,&rdquo; Birgitte replied
doubtfully, &ldquo;and put extra Guards on the streets that seem to be farthest away,
but it&rsquo;s still leaving a lot to fla&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to chance.&rdquo; She did not look
toward Mistress Harfor, but Elayne <em>felt</em> a faint hint of a blush from
her. &ldquo;Anybody can have flint and steel in a belt pouch, and it only takes a
minute with some dry straw to start a fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do what you can,&rdquo; Elayne told her. It would be pure luck if they
caught an arsonist in the act, and beyond luck if the arsonist could say more
than that she had been handed coin by someone with a hood hiding her face.
Tracing that gold back to Arymilla or Elenia or Naean would require Mat
Cauthon&rsquo;s luck. &ldquo;Have you anything more, Master Norry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Knuckling his long nose, he avoided her gaze. &ldquo;It has&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;come to my attention,&rdquo; he said hesitantly, &ldquo;that Marne, Arawn and Sarand have
all recently taken very large loans against the revenues of their estates.&rdquo;
Mistress Harfor&rsquo;s eyebrows climbed before she got them under control.</p>

<p>Peering into her teacup, Elayne discovered that she
had actually emptied it. Bankers never told anyone how much they had loaned to
whom, or against what, but she did not ask how he knew. It would be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;embarrassing. For both of them. She smiled when her sister took the cup, then
grimaced when Aviendha returned with it filled again. Aviendha seemed to think
she should drink weak tea till her eyes floated! Goat&rsquo;s milk was better, but
dishwater for tea would do. Well, she would hold the <em>bloody</em> cup, but she
did <em>not</em> have to drink.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mercenaries,&rdquo; Dyelin growled, the heat in her eyes enough to make a
bear back up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve said it before, and I&rsquo;ll say it again; the trouble with
sell-swords is they don&rsquo;t always stay bought.&rdquo; She had opposed hiring
mercenaries to help defend the city from the start, though the fact was that
without them, Arymilla could have ridden in with her army by any gate she
picked, or near enough. There simply had not been enough men to guard every
gate properly otherwise, much less man the walls.</p>

<p>Birgitte had opposed the mercenaries, too, yet she had
accepted Elayne&rsquo;s reasons, if reluctantly. She still distrusted them, but now
she shook her head. Sitting on the arm of a chair near the fire, she rested her
spurred boot on the seat. &ldquo;Mercenaries have a concern for their reputations if
not their honor. Changing sides is one thing; actually betraying a gate is
something else entirely. A company that did that would never be hired again,
anywhere. Arymilla would have to offer enough for a captain to live the rest of
his life like a lord, and at least convince his men they&rsquo;d be able to, as
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Norry cleared his throat. Even that sounded dusty,
somehow. &ldquo;It seems they may have borrowed against the same revenues twice or
even three times. The bankers, of course, are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;unaware&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;of this, as
yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Birgitte began to curse, then cut herself off. Dyelin
scowled into her wine hard enough to make
it turn sour. Aviendha squeezed Elayne&rsquo;s hand, just a quick pressure quickly
released. The fire crackled in a shower of sparks, some nearly reaching the
carpets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mercenary companies will have to be watched.&rdquo;
Elayne raised a hand to forestall Birgitte. The other woman had not opened her
mouth, but the bond shouted volumes. &ldquo;You will have to find the men for it
somewhere.&rdquo; Light! They seemed to be guarding against as many people inside the
city as outside! &ldquo;It shouldn&rsquo;t take that many, but we need to know if they
start to act strangely, or secretively, Birgitte. That might be our only
warning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was thinking what to do if one of the companies
does sell out,&rdquo; Birgitte said wryly. &ldquo;Knowing won&rsquo;t be enough unless I have men
to rush to any gate I think is going to be betrayed. And half the soldiers in
the city are mercenaries. Half the rest are old men who were living on their
pensions a few months gone. I&rsquo;ll shift the mercenaries&rsquo; postings at irregular
intervals. It will be harder for them to betray a gate if they can&rsquo;t be sure
where they&rsquo;ll be tomorrow, but that doesn&rsquo;t make it impossible.&rdquo; Protest how
she would that she was no general, she had seen more battles and sieges than
any ten generals living, and she knew very well how these matters unfolded.</p>

<p>Elayne almost wished she had wine in her cup. Almost.
&ldquo;Is there any chance the bankers will learn what you have, Master Norry? Before
the loans come due?&rdquo; If they did, some might decide they preferred Arymilla on
the throne. She could strip the country&rsquo;s coffers to repay those loans, then.
She might even do it. Merchants rode the political winds, whichever way they
blew. Bankers had been known to attempt to influence events.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my opinion, it is unlikely, my Lady. They would
have to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;um&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ask the right questions of the right people, but bankers
are normally&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;um&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;closemouthed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;with one another. Yes, I think
it unlikely. For the time being.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was nothing to be done in any case. Except to tell Birgitte there
might be a new source for assassins and kidnappers. Only given her hard
expression and a sudden grimness in the bond, she had already realized that.
There would be little chance of keeping the bodyguard under a hundred women,
now. If there ever had been.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Master Norry,&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done well, as always.
Let me know immediately if you see any indications that the bankers have asked
those questions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, my Lady,&rdquo; he murmured, ducking his head
like an egret darting after a fish. &ldquo;My Lady is very kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Reene and Norry left the room, him holding the door for her and
making a bow that was a hair more graceful than usual and her giving him a
slight bow of her head as she glided past him into the corridor, Aviendha did
not release the ward she was holding. As soon as the door closed, its solid
sound swallowed by the ward, she said, &ldquo;Someone tried to listen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne shook her head. There was no way to tell who&mdash;a Black sister? A
curious Kinswoman?&mdash;but at least the eavesdrop had failed. Not that there was
much chance of anyone getting past one of Aviendha&rsquo;s wards, maybe not even the
Forsaken, but she would have spoken up right away if someone had.</p>

<p>Dyelin took Aviendha&rsquo;s announcement with less aplomb,
muttering about the Sea Folk. She had not turned a hair at hearing that half
the Windfinders were leaving, not in front of Reene and Norry, but now she
demanded to know the whole story. &ldquo;I never did trust Zaida,&rdquo; she grumbled when
Elayne finished. &ldquo;This agreement sounds good for trade, I suppose, but it
wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if she had one of the Windfinders try to listen in. She
struck me as a woman who wants to know everything, just in case it might be
useful one day.&rdquo; There was very little hesitant about Dyelin, yet she hesitated
now, rolling her winecup between her palms. &ldquo;Are you certain this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;this <em>beacon&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</em> can&rsquo;t harm us, Elayne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As certain as I can be, Dyelin. If it was going to
crack open the world, I think it would have by now.&rdquo; Aviendha laughed, but
Dyelin turned quite pale. Really! Sometimes you had to laugh if only to keep
from crying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we tarry much longer now that Norry and Mistress
Harfor are gone,&rdquo; Birgitte said, &ldquo;somebody might start wondering why.&rdquo; She
waved a hand at the walls, indicating the ward she could not see. She knew it
was still in place, though. The daily meetings with the First Maid and the
First Clerk always concealed a little something more.</p>

<p>Everyone gathered around her as she moved a pair of
golden Sea Folk porcelain bowls on one of the side tables and pulled a
much-folded map from inside her short coat. It rode there always, except when
she slept, and then it resided beneath her pillow. Spread out, with empty
winecups at the corners to hold it flat, the map displayed Andor from the
River Erinin to the border between Altara and Murandy. In truth, it could have
been said to show all of Andor, since what lay farther west had been only half
under Caemlyn&rsquo;s control for generations. It had hardly been a masterpiece of
the mapmaker&rsquo;s art to begin with, and creases obscured much of the detail, but it
showed the terrain well enough, and every town and village was marked, every
road and bridge and ford. Elayne set her teacup down at arm&rsquo;s length from the
map to avoid spilling on it and adding more stains. And to rid herself of the
wretched excuse for tea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Borderlanders are moving,&rdquo; Birgitte said, pointing to the forests
north of Caemlyn, to a spot above Andor&rsquo;s northmost border, &ldquo;but they haven&rsquo;t
covered much ground. At this rate, they&rsquo;ll be well over a month getting close
to Caemlyn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Swirling her silver cup, Dyelin peered into the dark wine, then looked
up suddenly. &ldquo;I thought you northerners were used to snow, Lady Birgitte.&rdquo; Even
now she had to probe, and telling her not to would only make her ten times as
certain that Birgitte was hiding secrets, and twenty times as determined to
learn them.</p>

<p>Aviendha scowled at the older woman&mdash;when she was not
in awe of Birgitte, sometimes she became fiercely protective of Birgitte&rsquo;s
secrets&mdash;but Birgitte herself met Dyelin&rsquo;s gaze levelly, with no hint of alarm
in the bond. She had become quite comfortable with the lie about her origins.
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been back to Kandor in a long time.&rdquo; That was simple truth, though
it had been far longer than Dyelin could have imagined. The country had not
even been called Kandor, then. &ldquo;But no matter what you&rsquo;re used to, moving two
hundred thousand soldiers, not to mention the Light alone knows how many camp
followers, is slow going in winter. Worse, I sent Mistress Ocalin and Mistress
Fote to visit some of the villages a few miles south of the border.&rdquo; Sabeine
Ocalin and Julanya Fote were Kinswomen who could Travel. &ldquo;They say the
villagers think the Borderlanders are camped for the winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne <em>tsk</em>ed, frowning at the map as she traced
distances with a finger. She was counting on news of the Borderlanders, if not
on the Borderlanders themselves. Word of an army that size entering Andor
should be leaping ahead of it like wildfire in dry grass. No one but a fool
could believe they had marched all those hundreds of leagues to try conquering
Andor, but everyone who heard would be speculating on their intentions and what
to do about them, a different opinion on every tongue. Once the news began to
spread, anyway. When it did, she had an advantage over everyone else. She had
arranged for the Borderlanders to cross into Andor into the first place, and
she had already arranged for them to leave.</p>

<p>The choice had not been very difficult. Stopping them would have been a
bloody affair, if it could have been managed at all, and they wanted no more
than the width of a road to march onward into Murandy, where they thought they
would find the Dragon Reborn. That was her doing, as well. They hid their
reason for seeking Rand, and she was not about to give them a true location,
not when they had as many as a dozen Aes Sedai with them and hid that fact,
too. But once news of them reached the High Seats&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It should work,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;If necessary, we can plant rumors of
the Borderlanders ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It should work,&rdquo; Dyelin agreed, then added in a dark voice, &ldquo;As long as
Bashere and Bael keep a close rein on their men. It&rsquo;s going to be a volatile
mix, with Borderlanders, Aiel and the Legion of the Dragon all within a few
miles of one another. And I can&rsquo;t see how we can be sure the Asha&rsquo;man won&rsquo;t do
something mad.&rdquo; She ended with a sniff. In her book, a man had to be mad in the
first place, or he would never have chosen to become an Asha&rsquo;man. Aviendha
nodded. She disagreed with Dyelin almost as frequently as Birgitte did, but for
the most part, the Asha&rsquo;man were one thing they agreed on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make sure the Borderlanders stay well clear of
the Black Tower,&rdquo; Elayne reassured them, though she had done the same before.
Even Dyelin knew that Bael and Bashere would hold their forces in check&mdash;neither
man wanted a battle he did not need, and Davram Bashere certainly would not
fight his own countrymen&mdash;but anyone had a right to be uneasy about the
Asha&rsquo;man and what they might do. She slid her finger from the six-pointed star
identifying Caemlyn across the few miles to the ground the Asha&rsquo;man had
usurped. The Black Tower was not marked, but she knew all too well exactly
where it lay. At least that was well away from the Lugard Road. Sending the
Borderlanders south into Murandy without upsetting the Asha&rsquo;man would not be
difficult.</p>

<p>Her mouth compressed at the thought that she must not
upset the Asha&rsquo;man, but there was nothing to be done about it any time soon, so
she mentally shifted the black-coated men to one side. What could not be dealt
with now, had to be dealt with later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the others?&rdquo; She did not have to say more. Six major Houses
remained uncommitted&mdash;at least to her or Arymilla. Dyelin claimed they would
all come to Elayne eventually, but they showed no sign of it so far. Sabeine
and Julanya had been looking for word of those six, too. Both women had spent
the last twenty years as peddlers, accustomed to hard journeys, sleeping in
stables or under the trees, and listening to what people did not say as much as
to what they said. They made perfect scouts. It would be a great loss if they
had to be shifted to helping keep the city supplied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rumor has Lord Luan a dozen places, east and west.&rdquo;
Frowning at the much-creased map as though Luan&rsquo;s position should have been
marked on it, Birgitte muttered a curse, <em>much</em> viler than called for, now
that Reene Harfor was absent. &ldquo;Always the next village over, or the one beyond
that. Lady Ellorien and Lord Abelle seem to have vanished completely, difficult
as that has to be for a High Seat. At least, Mistress Ocalin and Mistress Fote
haven&rsquo;t been able to find a whisper of them, or of any House Pendar or House
Traemane armsmen, either. Not a man or a horse.&rdquo; <em>That</em> was very unusual.
Someone was exerting great effort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Abelle was always a ghost when he wanted to be,&rdquo; Dyelin muttered,
&ldquo;always able to catch you wrong-footed. Ellorien&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Brushing fingers
against her lips, she sighed. &ldquo;The woman&rsquo;s too flamboyant to disappear. Unless
she&rsquo;s with Abelle or Luan. Or both of them.&rdquo; She was not happy with that idea,
no matter what she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for our other &ldquo;friends&rsquo;,&rdquo; Birgitte said, &ldquo;Lady Arathelle crossed out
of Murandy five days ago, here.&rdquo; She touched the map lightly, some two hundred
miles south of Caemlyn. &ldquo;Four days ago, Lord Pelivar crossed about five or six
miles west of that, and Lady Aemlyn here, another five or six miles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not
together,&rdquo; Dyelin said, nodding. &ldquo;Did they bring any Murandians? No? Good. They
could be moving to their estates, Elayne. If they move further apart, we&rsquo;ll
know for certain.&rdquo; Those three Houses made her most anxious of all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They could
be heading home,&rdquo; Birgitte agreed, reluctantly as always when agreeing with
Dyelin. Drawing her intricate braid over her shoulder, she gripped it in a fist
almost the way Nynaeve did. &ldquo;The men and horses must be worn out, after
marching into Murandy in winter. But all we can be sure of is that they&rsquo;re on
the move.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha
snorted. With her in elegant velvets, it was a startling sound. &ldquo;Always assume
your enemy will do what you do not want. Decide what you least want them to do,
and plan on that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aemlyn,
Arathelle and Pelivar aren&rsquo;t enemies,&rdquo; Dyelin protested weakly. Wherever she
believed their allegiance would fall in time, those three had announced their
support of Dyelin herself for the throne.</p>

<p>Elayne
had never read of any queen being <em>forced</em> onto the throne&mdash;that sort of
thing might not have made it into the histories in any case&mdash;yet Aemlyn,
Arathelle and Pelivar seemed willing to try, and not for hope of power for
themselves. Dyelin did not want the throne, but she would hardly be a passive
ruler. The simple fact was that Morgase Trakand&rsquo;s final year had been marred
by blunder after blunder, and few knew or believed that she had been a captive
of one of the Forsaken during that time. Some Houses wanted anyone except
another Trakand on the throne. Or thought they did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the
last thing we want them to do?&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;If they disperse to their
estates, then they are out of it until spring at the earliest, and everything
will be decided by then.&rdquo; The Light willing, it would. &ldquo;But if they continue on
to Caemlyn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without
the Murandians, they don&rsquo;t have enough armsmen to challenge Arymilla.&rdquo; Studying
the map, Birgitte rubbed her chin. &ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t know by now that the Aiel and
the Legion of the Dragon are staying out of this, they&rsquo;ll have to learn of it
soon, but they&rsquo;ll want to be careful. None of them seems foolish enough to
provoke a fight they can&rsquo;t win when they don&rsquo;t have to. I&rsquo;d say they&rsquo;ll camp somewhere to the east or southeast, where
they can keep an eye on events and maybe influence what happens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Downing the last of her wine, which must have been cold by now, Dyelin
exhaled heavily and walked over to fill her cup again. &ldquo;If they come to
Caemlyn,&rdquo; she said in a leaden tone, &ldquo;then they are hoping that Luan or Abelle
or Ellorien will join them. Perhaps all three.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we must figure out how to stop them reaching Caemlyn before our
plans come to fruit, without making them permanent enemies.&rdquo; Elayne worked to
make her voice as sure and firm as Dyelin&rsquo;s was dull. &ldquo;And we must plan what to
do in case they arrive here too early. If that happens, Dyelin, you will have
to convince them the choice is between me and Arymilla. Otherwise, we&rsquo;ll be in
a tangle we may never straighten out, and all of Andor in it with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dyelin grunted as if she had been punched. The last time the great
Houses split evenly among three claimants for the Lion Throne had been nearly
five hundred years ago, and seven years of open war followed before a queen was
crowned. The original claimants were all dead by that point.</p>

<p>Without thinking, Elayne picked up her teacup and took a sip. The tea
had gone cold, but honey exploded on her tongue. Honey! She looked at Aviendha
in astonishment, and her sister&rsquo;s lips quirked in a small smile. A
conspiratorial smile, as if Birgitte did not know exactly what had happened.
Even their strangely enhanced bond did not extend to her tasting what Elayne
did, yet she had surely felt Elayne&rsquo;s surprise and pleasure on tasting the tea.
Planting fists on hips, she adopted a censorious look. Or rather, she tried to;
despite all she could do, a smile crept onto her face, too. Abruptly, Elayne
realized that Birgitte&rsquo;s headache was gone. She did not know when it had
vanished, but it certainly was not there any longer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hope for the best and plan for the worst,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Sometimes, the best actually happens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dyelin, unaware of the honey or anything except that they were all three
grinning, harrumphed loudly. &ldquo;And sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t happen. If your clever
scheme comes off <em>exactly</em> as planned, Elayne, we
won&rsquo;t have any need for Aemlyn or Ellorien or the others, but it&rsquo;s a
terrible gamble. All it takes to go wrong is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The
left-hand door opened to admit a wave of cold and an apple-cheeked woman with
icy eyes and the golden knot of an under-lieutenant on her shoulder. She might
have knocked first, but if so, the ward had sealed off the sound. Like Rasoria,
Tzigan Sokorin had been a Hunter for the Horn before joining Elayne&rsquo;s
bodyguard. It seemed the guard had changed. &ldquo;The Wise One Monaelle wishes to
see the Lady Elayne,&rdquo; Tzigan announced, drawing herself up rigidly. &ldquo;Mistress
Karistovan is with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sumeko
could be put off, but not Monaelle. Arymilla&rsquo;s people would as soon interfere
with Aes Sedai as with the Aiel, yet only something important would have
brought a Wise One into the city. Birgitte knew that, too; she immediately
began folding the map up again. Aviendha let the warding dissipate and released
the Source.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask
them to come in,&rdquo; Elayne said.</p>

<p>Monaelle did
not wait on Tzigan, gliding into the room as soon as the ward vanished, her
multitude of gold and ivory bracelets rattling as she lowered her shawl from
shoulders to elbows in the comparative warmth. Elayne did not know how old Monaelle
was&mdash;Wise Ones were not as reticent about age as Aes Sedai, but they <em>were</em> oblique&mdash;yet she appeared not far into her middle years. There were hints of red in
her waist-long yellow hair, but not a touch of gray. Short for an Aiel, shorter
than Elayne, with a mild, motherly face, she was barely strong enough in the
Power to have been accepted in the White Tower, but strength did not count
among Wise Ones, and among them, she stood very high. More importantly for
Elayne and Aviendha, she had been the midwife at their rebirth as
first-sisters. Elayne offered her a curtsy, ignoring Dyelin&rsquo;s disapproving
sniff, and Aviendha made a deep bow, folding herself over her hands. Aside
from the duties owed to her midwife under Aiel customs, she was still only an
apprentice Wise One, after all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I assume
your need for privacy is ended, since you lowered the ward,&rdquo; Monaelle said,
&ldquo;and it is time I checked on your condition, Elayne Trakand. It should be done
twice in the month until full term.&rdquo; Why was she frowning at Aviendha? Oh,
Light, the velvets!</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I have come to see what she does,&rdquo; Sumeko added, following the
Wise One into the room. Sumeko was imposing, a stout woman with confident eyes,
in well-cut red-belted yellow wool, with silver combs in her straight black
hair, and a red-enameled silver circle-pin on the high neck of her dress. She
might have been a noblewoman or a successful merchant. Once she had shown a certain
diffidence, at least around Aes Sedai, but no longer. Not with Aes Sedai or
soldiers of the Queen&rsquo;s Guards. &ldquo;You may go,&rdquo; she told Tzigan. &ldquo;This doesn&rsquo;t
concern you.&rdquo; Or with nobles, for that matter. &ldquo;You may leave, too, Lady
Dyelin, and you, Lady Birgitte.&rdquo; She studied Aviendha as if considering adding
her to the list.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aviendha may remain,&rdquo; Monaelle said. &ldquo;She is missing
a great many lessons, and she must learn this sooner or later.&rdquo; Sumeko nodded
in acceptance of Aviendha, but she kept a coolly impatient gaze on Dyelin and
Birgitte.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lady Dyelin and I have matters to discuss,&rdquo; Birgitte
said, stuffing the folded map back under her red coat as she started for the
door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you tonight what we&rsquo;ve thought of, Elayne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dyelin gave her a sharp look, almost as sharp as the one she had given
Sumeko, but she set her winecup on one of the trays and made her courtesies to
Elayne, then waited with visible impatience while Birgitte bent to murmur at
length in Monaelle&rsquo;s ear and the Wise One replied briefly, but just as quietly.
What were they whispering about? Probably goat&rsquo;s milk.</p>

<p>Once the door closed behind Tzigan and the other two women, Elayne
offered to send for more wine, since what was in the pitchers was cold, but
Sumeko declined curtly, and Monaelle politely if rather absently. The Wise One
was studying Aviendha with such intensity that the younger woman began to
redden and looked away, gripping her skirts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t take Aviendha to task about her clothes,
Monaelle,&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;I asked her to wear them, and she did as a favor to
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pursing her lips, Monaelle thought before answering.
&ldquo;First-sisters should give one another favors,&rdquo; she said finally. &ldquo;You know
your duty to our people, Aviendha. So far, you have done well at a difficult
task. You must learn to live in two worlds, so it is fitting that you become
comfortable in those clothes.&rdquo; Aviendha began to relax. Until Monaelle
continued. &ldquo;But not too comfortable. From now on, you will spend every third
day and night in the tents. You can return with me tomorrow. You have a great
deal to learn yet before you can become a Wise One, and that is as much your
duty as is being a binding cord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne reached out and took her sister&rsquo;s hand, and
when Aviendha tried to let go after one squeeze, she held on. After a brief
hesitation, Aviendha clung, too. In a strange way, having Aviendha there had
comforted Elayne for the loss of Rand; she was not only a sister but a sister
who also loved him. They could share strength and make each other laugh when
they wanted to cry, and they could cry together when that was needed. One night
in three alone very likely meant one night in three weeping alone. Light, what
was Rand <em>doing?</em> That awful beacon to the west was still blazing as
strongly as ever, and she was certain that he was in the heart of it. Not one
particle had changed in the bond with him, but she was certain.</p>

<p>Suddenly she realized that she had a crushing grasp on
Aviendha&rsquo;s hand, and Aviendha was holding hers as fiercely. They loosened their
grips at the same instant. Neither let go, however.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men cause trouble even when they are elsewhere,&rdquo;
Aviendha said softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They do,&rdquo; Elayne agreed.</p>

<p>Monaelle smiled at the exchange. She was among the few who knew about
the bonding of Rand, and who the father of Elayne&rsquo;s baby was. None of the
Kinswomen did, though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d think you&rsquo;ve let a man cause you all the trouble he could, Elayne,&rdquo;
Sumeko said primly. The Kin&rsquo;s Rule followed the rules for novices and Accepted,
forbidding not only children but anything that might lead to them, and they
held to it strictly. Once, a Kinswoman would have swallowed her tongue before
suggesting an Aes Sedai fell short of their Rule. Much had changed since then,
however. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m supposed to travel to Tear today so I can bring back a shipment
of grain and oil tomorrow, and it is growing late, so if you are done talking
about men, I suggest you let Monaelle get on with what she came for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monaelle positioned Elayne in front of the fireplace, close enough that
the heat from the nearly consumed logs was near to uncomfortable&mdash;it was best
if the mother was very warm, she explained&mdash;then the glow of <em>saidar</em> surrounded
her, and she began to weave threads of Spirit and Fire and Earth. Aviendha
watched almost as avidly as Sumeko.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; Elayne asked as the weave settled around her and sank
into her. &ldquo;Is it like Delving?&rdquo; Every Aes Sedai in the palace had Delved her,
though only Merilille had sufficient skill with Healing for it to be much use,
but neither they nor Sumeko had been able to say much more than that she was
with child. She felt a faint tingling, a sort of hum inside her flesh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, girl,&rdquo; Sumeko said absently. Elayne
raised an eyebrow, and even thought of waving her Great Serpent ring under
Sumeko&rsquo;s nose, but the round-faced woman did not appear to notice. She might
not have noticed the ring, either. She was leaning forward, peering as though
she could see the weave inside Elayne&rsquo;s body. &ldquo;The Wise Ones learned about
Healing from me. And from Nynaeve, I suppose,&rdquo; she allowed after a moment. Oh,
Nynaeve would have gone up like an Illuminator&rsquo;s firework, hearing that. But
then, Sumeko had outstripped Nynaeve long since. &ldquo;And they did learn the simple
form from Aes Sedai.&rdquo; A snort like ripping canvas showed what Sumeko thought of
the &ldquo;simple&rdquo; form, the only sort of Healing Aes Sedai had known for thousands
of years. &ldquo;This is something of the Wise Ones&rsquo; own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is called Caressing the Child,&rdquo; Monaelle said in
an abstracted voice. Most of her attention was focused on the weave. A simple
Delving to learn what ailed someone&mdash;it <em>was</em> simple, come to think&mdash;would have been finished by now, but she altered the flows, and the hum inside
Elayne changed pitch, sinking deeper. &ldquo;It may be some part of Healing, a sort
of Healing, but we have known this since before we were sent to the Threefold
Land. Some of the ways the flows are used are similar to what Sumeko Karistovan
and Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara showed us. In Caressing the Child, you learn the health of
mother and child, and by changing the weaves, you can cure some problems of
either, but they will not work on a woman who is not with child. Or on a man,
of course.&rdquo; The hum grew louder, until it seemed everyone must be able to hear
it. Elayne thought her teeth were vibrating.</p>

<p>An earlier thought returned to her, and she said, &ldquo;Will channeling hurt
my child? If I channel, I mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more than breathing does.&rdquo; Monaelle let the weave vanish with a
grin. &ldquo;You have two. It is too early to say whether they are girls or boys,
but they are healthy, and so are you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two! Elayne shared a wide smile with Aviendha. She
could almost feel her sister&rsquo;s delight. She was going to have twins. Rand&rsquo;s
babies. A boy and a girl, she hoped, or two boys. Twin girls would present all
manner of difficulties for the succession. No one ever gained the Rose Crown
with <em>everyone</em> behind her.</p>

<p>Sumeko made an urgent sound in her throat, gesturing toward Elayne, and
Monaelle nodded. &ldquo;Do exactly as I did, and you will see.&rdquo; Watching Sumeko
embrace the Source and form the weave, she nodded again, and the round
Kinswoman let it sink into Elayne, letting out a gasp as if she felt the
humming herself. &ldquo;You will not have to worry about birthing sickness,&rdquo; Monaelle
went on, &ldquo;but you will find that you have difficulty in channeling sometimes.
The threads may slip away from you as though greased or fade like mist, so you
will have to try again and again to make the simplest weave or hold it. This
may grow worse as your pregnancy progresses, and you will not be able to
channel at all while in labor or giving birth, but it will come right after the
children are born. You soon will become moody, too, if that has not already
started, weepy one minute and snarling the next. The father of your child will
be wise to step warily and keep his distance as much as he can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear she&rsquo;s already snapped his head off once this
morning,&rdquo; Sumeko muttered. Releasing the weave, she straightened and adjusted
her red belt around her girth. &ldquo;This is remarkable, Monaelle. I never thought
of a weave that could only be used on a pregnant woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s mouth tightened, but what she said was &ldquo;You
can tell all of that with this weave, Monaelle?&rdquo; It was best that people
thought her babes were Doilan Mellar&rsquo;s. Rand al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s children would be
targets, stalked for fear or advantage or hatred, but no one would think twice
about Mellar&rsquo;s, perhaps not even Mellar. It <em>was</em> for the best, and that
was that.</p>

<p>Monaelle threw back her head, laughing so hard that she had to wipe a
corner of her eyes with her shawl. &ldquo;I know this from bearing seven children and
having three husbands, Elayne Trakand. The ability to channel shields you from
the birthing sickness, but there are other prices to pay. Come, Aviendha, you
must try, too. Carefully, now. Exactly as I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eagerly, Aviendha embraced the Source, but before she had begun to weave
a thread, she let <em>saidar</em> go and turned her head to stare toward the
dark-paneled wall. Toward the west. So did Elayne, and Monaelle, and Sumeko.
The beacon that had been burning for so long had just vanished. One instant it
had been there, that raging blaze of <em>saidar</em>, and then it was gone as if
it had never existed.</p>

<p>Sumeko&rsquo;s massive bosom heaved as she drew a deep
breath. &ldquo;I think something very wonderful or very terrible has happened today,&rdquo;
she said softly. &ldquo;And I think I am afraid to learn which.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonderful,&rdquo; Elayne said. It was done, whatever <em>it</em> was,
and Rand was alive. That was wonderful enough. Monaelle glanced at her
quizzically. Knowing about the bond, she could puzzle out the rest, but she
only fingered one of her necklaces in a thoughtful manner. In any case, she
would pry it out of Aviendha soon enough.</p>

<p>A knock at the door made them all start. All but Monaelle, anyway.
Pretending not to see the other women jump, she focused a little too intently
on adjusting her shawl which made the contrast all the greater. Sumeko coughed
to hide her embarrassment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; Elayne said loudly. A half-shout was necessary to be heard
through the door even without a ward.</p>

<p>Caseille put her head into the room, plumed hat in hand, then came in
the rest of the way and closed the door carefully behind her. The white lace at
her neck and wrists was fresh, the lace and lions on her sash gleamed, and her
breastplate sparkled as if freshly burnished, but obviously she had gone right
back on duty after cleaning up from their overnight trip. &ldquo;Forgive me for
interrupting, my Lady, but I thought you should know right away. The Sea Folk
are in a frenzy, those that are still here. It seems one of their apprentices
has gone missing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What else?&rdquo; Elayne said. A missing apprentice might be bad enough, but
something in Caseille&rsquo;s face told her there <em>was</em> more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guardswoman Azeri happened to tell me that she saw Merilille Sedai
leaving the palace about three hours ago,&rdquo; Caseille said reluctantly.
&ldquo;Merilille and a woman who was cloaked and hooded. They took horses, and a
loaded pack mule. Yurith said the second woman&rsquo;s hands were tattooed. My Lady,
no one had any reason to be looking for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne waved her to silence. &ldquo;No one did anything wrong, Caseille. No
one will be blamed.&rdquo; Not among the Guards, anyway. A fine pickle this was.
Talaan and Metarra, the two apprentice Windfinders, were very strong in the
Power, and if Merilille had been able to talk either one into trying to become
Aes Sedai, she might have been able to convince herself that taking the girl where
she could be entered into the novice book was reason enough to evade her own
promise to teach the Windfinders. Who would be more than upset over losing
Merilille, and more than furious over the apprentice. <em>They</em> would blame
everyone in sight, and Elayne most of all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this general knowledge about Merilille?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet, my Lady, but whoever saddled their horses and loaded that mule
won&rsquo;t hold their tongues. Stablehands don&rsquo;t have much to gossip about.&rdquo; More of
a brush fire than a pickle, then, and small chance of putting it out before it
reached the barns.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you will dine with me later, Monaelle,&rdquo; Elayne
said, &ldquo;but you must forgive me, now.&rdquo; Duty to her midwife or no, she did not
wait for the other woman&rsquo;s assent. Trying to douse the fire might be enough to
stop the barns from catching. Maybe. &ldquo;Caseille, inform Birgitte, and tell her I
want an order sent to the gates immediately to watch for Merilille. I know; I
know; she may be out of the city already, and the gate guards won&rsquo;t stop an Aes
Sedai, anyway, but maybe they can delay her, or frighten her companion into
scuttling back into the city to hide. Sumeko, would you ask Reanne to assign
every Kinswoman who can&rsquo;t Travel to start searching through the city. It&rsquo;s a
small hope, but Merilille may have thought it was too late in the day to start
out. Check every inn, including the Silver Swan, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hoped Rand had done something wonderful today, but
she could not waste time even thinking about that now. She had a throne
to gain and angry Atha&rsquo;an Miere to deal with, before they could vent their
anger on her, it was to be hoped. In short, it was a day like every other since
she returned to Caemlyn, and that meant her hands were quite full enough.</p>
