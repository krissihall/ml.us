<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">O</span>nce Delana
was sure that her noxious seed had taken root, she murmured that it might be
best if they were not seen arriving back at the camp together and slipped away,
pushing her mare to a quick trot through the snow and leaving the rest of them
to ride on in uneasy silence except for the crunch of the horses&rsquo; hooves. The
Warders maintained their distance behind, and the escorting soldiers had their
attention back on the farms and thickets, without so much as a glance toward
the Aes Sedai that Egwene could see, now. Men never knew when to keep their
mouths shut, though. Telling a man to be quiet only made him gossip all the
harder, just to close friends he could trust, to be sure, as if they in turn
would not tell everyone who would listen. The Warders might be different&mdash;Aes
Sedai always insisted they were, those who had Warders&mdash;but no doubt the
soldiers would talk of sisters arguing, and no doubt they would say Delana had
been sent off with a flea in her ear. The woman had planned this very carefully.
Worse than fireweed or stranglervine could grow if that seed was allowed to
sprout, but the Gray Sitter had sheltered herself from blame very neatly. Truth
almost always did come out in the end, but by the end, truth was often so
wrapped around with rumors and speculation and absolute lies that
most people never did believe it.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">&ldquo;I trust I
don&rsquo;t have to ask whether any of you had heard about this before.&rdquo; Egwene said
that quite casually, seemingly studying the countryside as they rode, but she
was pleased when everyone denied it outright with considerable indignation,
including Beonin, who was working her jaw and glaring at Morvrin. Egwene
trusted them as far as she dared&mdash;they could not have given her their oaths
without meaning to hold to every word; not unless they were Black Ajah, a
niggling possibility that accounted for most of her caution&mdash;yet even oaths of
fealty left room for the most loyal people doing the worst possible thing in
the belief that it was in your best interest. And people who had been coerced
into their oaths could be adept at spotting the gaps and leeways.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The
real question,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;is what was Delana after?&rdquo; She had no need to
explain, not for these women, every one experienced in the Game of Houses. If
all Delana had wanted was to stop negotiations with Elaida while keeping her
own name out of it, she could simply have spoken to Egwene alone at any time.
Sitters needed no excuse to come to the Amyrlin&rsquo;s study. Or she could have used
Halima, who slept on a pallet in Egwene&rsquo;s tent most nights despite being
Delana&rsquo;s secretary. Egwene was troubled with headaches, and some nights only
Halima&rsquo;s massages could soothe them so she could sleep. For that matter, an
anonymous note might have been sufficient to make her present the Hall with an
edict forbidding negotiations. The touchiest quibbler would have to admit that
talks to end the war certainly touched on the war. But plainly Delana wanted
Sheriam and the others to know, too. Her talebearing was an arrow aimed at
another target.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strife
between the Ajah heads and the Sitters,&rdquo; Carlinya said, as cool as the snow.
&ldquo;Perhaps strife between the Ajahs.&rdquo; Casually adjusting her cloak, intricately
embroidered white-on-white but lined with dense black fur, she might have been
discussing the price of a spool of thread. &ldquo;Why she wants these things, I can&rsquo;t
begin to say, but those will be the results, unless we are very careful, and
she could not know we would be careful, or that we have any reason to be, so
logically one or both must be her aim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The
first answer that comes to mind isn&rsquo;t always correct, Carlinya,&rdquo; Morvrin said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no saying that Delana
thought her actions through as carefully as you have, or that she thought along
the same lines.&rdquo; The stout Brown believed more in common sense than logic, or
so she said, but in truth she seemed to blend the two, a combination that made
her very hardheaded, and suspicious of quick or easy answers. Which was not a
bad thing to be. &ldquo;Delana may be trying to sway some among the Sitters on some
issue that&rsquo;s important to her. Maybe she hopes to get Elaida declared Black
Ajah after all. No matter the results, her goal may be something we don&rsquo;t even
suspect. Sitters can be as petty as anyone else. For all we know, she might
have a grudge against one of those she named dating back to when she was a
novice and they taught her. Better to concentrate on what will come of it than
to worry about why until we know more.&rdquo; Her tone was as placid as her broad
face, but Carlinya&rsquo;s cool composure flickered to cool disdain for a moment. Her
rationality made few concessions for human foibles. Or for anyone disagreeing
with her.</p>

<p>Anaiya laughed, a sound of almost motherly amusement that made her bay
dance a few steps before she reined him back to a walk. A motherly farmwife
amused by the antics of others in the village. Even some sisters were foolish
enough to dismiss her that easily. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sulk, Carlinya. You are very probably
right. No, Morvrin, she probably is. In any event, I believe we can squash any
hopes she has for discord.&rdquo; That did not sound amused at all. No Blue was amused
by anything that might hamper pulling Elaida down.</p>

<p>Myrelle gave a savage nod of agreement, then blinked
in surprise when Nisao said, &ldquo;Can you afford to stop this, Mother?&rdquo; The tiny
Yellow did not speak up often. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean whatever Delana is trying to do.
If we can settle on what that is,&rdquo; she added quickly, making a gesture at
Morvrin, who had opened her mouth again. Nisao looked a child alongside the
other women, but it was a peremptory gesture. She was Yellow, after all, with
all the self-assurance that implied, and unwilling to step back for anyone in
most circumstances. &ldquo;I mean the talk of parley with the Sitters in the Tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment, everyone gaped at her, even Beonin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why would we want to allow that?&rdquo; Anaiya said
finally, in a dangerous voice. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t come all this way to <em>talk</em> to
Elaida.&rdquo; She was a farmwife with a cleaver hidden behind her back and a mind to
use it, now.</p>

<p>Nisao looked up at her and sniffed dismissively. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t say we wanted it. I asked whether we dare stop it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hardly see the difference.&rdquo; Sheriam&rsquo;s voice was icy, and her face
pale. With anger, Egwene thought, but it might have been fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then think for a while, and you might see it,&rdquo; Nisao
said dryly. Dry the way a knife-blade was dry, and equally cutting. &ldquo;At present,
talk of negotiations is limited to five Sitters, and very quiet, but will it
remain so? Once word spreads that talks were proposed and rejected, how long
before despair sets in? No, hear me out! We all set off full of righteous fury
for justice, yet here we sit, staring at the walls of Tar Valon, while Elaida
sits in the Tower. We&rsquo;ve been here nearly two weeks, and for all anyone can
see, we may be here two years, or twenty. The longer we sit with nothing
happening, the more sisters will start making excuses for Elaida&rsquo;s crimes. The
more they&rsquo;ll start thinking that we <em>have</em> to mend the Tower, never mind
the cost. Do you want to wait until sisters start slipping back to Elaida one
by one? I myself do not fancy standing on the riverbank defying the woman with
just the Blue Ajah and the rest of you for company. Negotiations will at least
let everyone see that <em>something</em> is happening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one is going to return to Elaida,&rdquo; Anaiya protested, shifting on
her saddle, but she wore a troubled frown, and she sounded as if she could see
it happening. The Tower beckoned to every Aes Sedai. Very likely even Black
sisters yearned for the Tower to be whole again. And there it stood, just a few
miles away, but seemingly out of reach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Talk could buy time, Mother,&rdquo; Morvrin said reluctantly, and no one
could put as much reluctance in her voice as she. Her frown was thoughtful, and
not at all pleased. &ldquo;A few more weeks, and Lord Gareth might be able to find
the ships he needs to block the harbors. That will alter everything, in our
favor. With no way for food to get in or mouths to get out, the city will be
starving inside a month.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene hung on to a smooth face with an effort. There was no real hope
of ships to block the harbor, though none of them knew that. Gareth had made it
plain enough to her, however, long before leaving Murandy. Originally, he had
hoped to buy vessels while they marched north along the Erinin, using them to
ferry supplies until they reached Tar Valon, then sinking them in the harbor
mouths. Using gateways to reach Tar Valon had put paid to that in more ways
than one. Word of the siege had left the city with the first ships sailing
after the army arrived, and now, as far north and south as he had sent riders,
ship captains were carrying out their business ashore by boat, from anchorages
well out in the river. No captain was willing to risk the chance her ship would
simply be seized. Gareth made his reports only to her, and his officers only
to him, yet any sister could have known if she talked with a few soldiers.</p>

<p>Fortunately, even sisters looking for Warders rarely spoke to soldiers.
They were generally accounted a thieving, unlettered lot who only bathed by
accident, when they had to wade a stream. Not the kind of man any sister spent
time with except when compelled to. It made keeping secrets easier, and some
secrets were essential. Including, sometimes, secrets kept from those
seemingly on your side. She could remember not thinking that way, but that was
a part of the innkeeper&rsquo;s daughter she had been obliged to leave behind. This
was another world, with very different rules from Emond&rsquo;s Field. A misstep
there meant a summons to the Women&rsquo;s Circle. Here, a misstep meant death or
worse, and for more than herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Sitters remaining in the Tower should be willing
to talk,&rdquo; Carlinya put in, with a sigh. &ldquo;They have to know that the longer the
siege lasts, the more chance Lord Gareth will find his ships. I cannot think
how long they will continue talking, though, when they realize we do not mean
to surrender.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elaida will insist on that,&rdquo; Myrelle muttered, yet
she did not seem to be arguing, just talking to herself, and Sheriam shivered,
drawing her cloak around her as though she had let the cold touch her.</p>

<p>Only Beonin looked happy, sitting eager and upright in her saddle, dark
honey hair framing a wide smile inside her hood. She did not press her case,
however. She was good at negotiation, so everyone said, and knew when to wait.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did say you could begin,&rdquo; Egwene said. Not that she had meant it for
more than a setdown, yet if you were going to live by the Three Oaths, then you
had to stand by what you said. She could not wait to hold the Oath Rod. It
would be so much easier, then. &ldquo;Just make sure you&rsquo;re very careful what you
say. Unless they think we all grew wings to fly here, they must suspect we&rsquo;ve
rediscovered Traveling, but they can&rsquo;t be certain unless someone confirms it.
It&rsquo;s better for us if they stay uncertain. That must be one secret you hold as
tightly as you hold the secret of our ferrets in the Tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Myrelle and Anaiya jerked at that, and Carlinya looked around as though
fearful, though neither Warders nor soldiers were close enough to hear unless
someone shouted. Morvrin merely took on an even more sour expression. Even
Nisao looked a little ill, though she had had nothing to do with the decision
to send sisters back to the Tower in secret, supposedly answering Elaida&rsquo;s summons.
The Hall might be happy to learn that ten sisters were in the Tower trying to
undermine Elaida however they could, even if the effort had borne no apparent
fruit so far, but the Sitters would most definitely be <em>unhappy</em> at
realizing that it had been kept secret because these women feared that some of
the Sitters might actually be Black Ajah. As well for Sheriam and the others to
reveal their oaths to Egwene as reveal that. The results for them might not be
very different. The Hall had not ordered anyone birched yet, but the way most
Sitters chafed at the bit over Egwene&rsquo;s control of the war, it could hardly come
as a surprise if they jumped at the chance to show they still had some
authority while simultaneously expressing their displeasure forcefully.</p>

<p>Beonin was apparently the only one who had opposed that decision&mdash;at
least, until it became apparent the others were going ahead anyway&mdash;but she
drew a shuddering breath, too, and a tightness settled around her eyes. In her
case, the sudden realization of just what she had undertaken might have played
its part, too. Just finding someone in the Tower who was willing to talk might
prove a daunting task. Eyes-and-ears inside Tar Valon could offer only hearsay
about events inside the Tower; news of the Tower itself came only in dribs and
drabs, from sisters venturing into <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> to glimpse fleeting
reflections of the waking world, but every last one of those scraps told of
Elaida ruling by edict and caprice, with not even the Hall daring to stand
against her. Beonin&rsquo;s face took on a grayish tinge, till she began to appear
more sickly than Nisao. Anaiya and the others looked as bleak as death.</p>

<p>A wave of gloom rose in Egwene. These were among the strongest against
Elaida, even the foot-dragging Beonin, who always wanted to talk rather than
act. Well, Grays were noted for believing that anything could be solved with
enough talk. They should try that on a Trolloc sometime, or just a footpad, and
see how far they got! Without Sheriam and the rest, resistance to Elaida would
have fallen apart before it ever had a chance to coalesce. It nearly had
anyway. But Elaida was as firmly seated in the Tower as ever, and after all
they had gone through, all they had done, it seemed that even Anaiya saw it all
melting away into disaster.</p>

<p>No! Drawing a deep breath, Egwene straightened her shoulders and sat
erect in her saddle. <em>She</em> was the lawful Amyrlin, no matter what the Hall
had thought they were getting when they raised her, and she had to keep the
rebellion against Elaida alive to have any hope of healing the Tower. If that
required a pretense of negotiations, it would not be the first time Aes Sedai
had pretended to aim at one thing while targeting another. Whatever was
required to keep the rebellion alive and pull Elaida down, she would do.
Whatever was required.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stretch the talks out as long as you can,&rdquo; she told Beonin. &ldquo;You can
talk about anything, so long as you keep the secrets that need keeping, but
agree to nothing, and keep them talking.&rdquo; Swaying in her saddle, the Gray
definitely looked sicker than Anaiya. She almost appeared ready to empty her
stomach.</p>

<p>When the camp came into sight, with the sun nearly
halfway to its noonday peak, the escort of lightly armored horsemen broke away
back toward the river, leaving Egwene and the sisters to ride the last mile
across the snow followed by the Warders. Lord Gareth paused as if he wanted to
speak with her once more, but finally he turned his bay east after the cavalry,
trotting to catch up as they vanished beyond a long, coppiced stand of trees.
He would not bring up their disagreement, or their discussions, where anyone
else could hear, and he believed that Beonin and the others were just what
everyone else thought them, the Ajahs&rsquo; watchdogs. She felt a little sad at
holding things back from him, but the fewer who knew a secret, the more likely
it would remain secret.</p>

<p>The camp was a sprawl of tents in every shape and size and color and
state of repair that almost covered a broad tree-rimmed pasture, halfway
between Tar Valon and Dragonmount, inside a ring of horselines and rows of
wagons and carts in almost as many shapes as there were wagons and carts.
Chimney smoke rose in several places a few miles beyond the treeline, but the
local farmers stayed away except for selling eggs and milk and butter, or
sometimes when one needed Healing from some accident, and there was no sign at
all of the army Egwene had brought so far. Gareth had concentrated his forces
along the river, part occupying the bridge towns on both banks and the rest in
what he called reserve camps, placed where men could be rushed to help fight
off any sortie in strength from the city, just in case he was wrong about High
Captain Chubain. Always consider the possibility your assumptions are wrong,
he had told her. No one objected to his placements, of course, not in general
anyway. Any number of sisters were ready to nitpick the details, but holding
the bridge towns was the only way to besiege Tar Valon, after all. By land, it
was. And a good many Aes Sedai were pleased to have the soldiers out of sight
if not out of mind.</p>

<p>Three Warders in color-shifting cloaks came riding out
from the camp as Egwene and the others approached, one of them very tall and
one quite short, so they seemed arranged in steps. Making their bows to Egwene
and the sisters, nodding to the Warders behind, they all had that dangerous look
of men so confident that they had no need to convince anyone how dangerous they
were, which somehow made it all the more evident. A Warder at his ease and a
lion resting on a hill, so went an old saying among Aes Sedai. The rest of it
was lost in the years, but there really was no need to say more. The sisters
were not entirely complacent about the safety of even a camp full of Aes Sedai,
under the circumstances. Warders patrolled closely for miles in every
direction, lions on the prowl.</p>

<p>Anaiya and the others, all but Sheriam, scattered as
soon as they reached the first row of tents beyond the wagons. Each would be
seeking out the head of her Ajah, ostensibly to report on Egwene&rsquo;s ride to the
river with Lord Gareth, and more importantly, to make sure those Ajah heads
knew that some of the Sitters were talking about negotiations with Elaida and
that Egwene was being firm. It would have been easier if she knew who those
women were, but even oaths of fealty did not stretch to revealing that. Myrelle
had nearly swallowed her tongue when Egwene suggested it. Being dropped into a
job without training was hardly the best way to learn it, and Egwene knew she
had oceans to learn yet about being Amyrlin. Oceans to learn, and a job of work
to do at the same time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will forgive me, Mother,&rdquo; Sheriam said when
Beonin, the last to go, vanished among the tents trailed by her scar-faced
Warder, &ldquo;I have a writing table piled high with paper.&rdquo; The lack of enthusiasm
in her voice was understandable. The Keeper&rsquo;s stole came along with evergrowing
stacks of reports to be sorted and documents to be prepared. Despite her zeal
for the rest of the job, which in this case was to keep the camp running,
Sheriam had been heard to mutter fervent wishes, when confronted by yet another
mound of papers, that she was still Mistress of Novices.</p>

<p>Still, as soon as Egwene gave permission, she booted
her black-footed dapple to a trot, scattering a covey of workmen in rough coats
and mufflers wrapped around their heads, who were carrying large baskets on
their backs. One fell flat on his face in the half-frozen muck that passed for
a street. Sheriam&rsquo;s Arinvar, a slim Cairhienin with graying temples, paused
long enough to make sure the fellow was getting to his feet, then spurred his
dark bay stallion after her, leaving the workman to his curses, most of which
seemed to be directed at his companions&rsquo; laughter. Everyone knew that when an
Aes Sedai wanted to go somewhere, you got out of the way.</p>

<p>What had spilled out of the fellow&rsquo;s basket onto the
street caught Egwene&rsquo;s eye and made her shiver, a tall heap of meal crawling
with weevils till it seemed there were as many moving black specks as meal. The
men must all have been carrying ruined meal to the midden heaps. There was no
use bothering to sift anything that infested&mdash;only someone who was starving
could eat it&mdash;but too many baskets of meal and grain had to be disposed of
every day. For that matter, half the barrels of salt pork and salt beef opened
for use stank so that there was nothing to be done except bury them. For the
servants and workmen, at least those who had experience of camp life, that was
nothing new. A little worse than usual, but not unheard of. Weevils could
appear any time, and merchants trying to stretch their profits always sold some
rotting meat along with the good. Among the Aes Sedai, though, it was cause for
deep worry. Every barrel of meat, every sack of grain or flour or meal, had
been surrounded by a Keeping as soon as bought, and whatever was woven into a
Keeping could not change until the weave was removed. But still the meat rotted
and the insects multiplied. It was as though <em>saidar</em> itself was failing.
You could get a sister to make jokes about the Black Ajah before you could get
her to talk about that.</p>

<p>One of the laughing men caught sight of Egwene
watching them and nudged the mud-covered fellow, who moderated his language,
though not very far. He even glowered as if blaming her for his fall. With her
face half-hidden by her hood and the Amyrlin&rsquo;s stole folded in her belt pouch,
they seemed to take her for one of the Accepted, not all of whom had enough
proper clothing to always dress as they should, or perhaps a visitor. Women
frequently slipped into the camp, often keeping their faces hidden in public
until they left again whether they wore fine silks or threadbare wool, and
showing a sour expression to a stranger or an Accepted was certainly safer than
grimacing at an Aes Sedai. It seemed odd not to have everyone in sight bobbing
and bowing.</p>

<p>She had been in the saddle since before first light, and if a hot bath
was out of the question&mdash;water had to be carried in from the wells that had
been dug half a mile west of the camp, which made all but the most fastidious
or self-absorbed sisters limit themselves&mdash;if a long hot soak was not to be
had, she still would have liked to put her feet back on the ground. Or better
yet, put them up on a footstool. Besides, refusing to let the cold touch you
was not at all the same as warming your hands at a toasty brazier. Her own writing
table would have its pile of paper, too. Last night she had told Sheriam to
give her the reports on the state of wagon repairs and the supply of fodder for
the horses. They would be dry and boring, but she checked on different areas
every day, so she could at least tell whether what people told her was based on
fact or wishes. And there were always the eyes-and-ears&rsquo; reports that the Ajahs
decided to pass along to the Amyrlin Seat made for fascinating reading when
compared to what Siuan and Leane gave her from their agents. It was not so much
that there were contradictions, yet what the Ajahs chose to keep to themselves
could draw interesting pictures. Comfort and duty both pulled her toward her
study&mdash;just another tent, really, though everyone called it the Amyrlin&rsquo;s
study&mdash;but this was an opportunity to look around without having everything
hastily made ready ahead of her arrival. Pulling her hood a little further
forward to better conceal her face, she touched her heels lightly to Daishar&rsquo;s
flanks.</p>

<p>There were few people mounted, mostly Warders, though the infrequent
groom added to the traffic, leading a horse at as close to a trot as could be
managed in the ankle-deep slush, but no one seemed to recognize her or her
mount. In contrast to the nearly empty streets, the wooden walkways, no more
than rough planks pegged atop sawn logs, shifted slightly under the weight of
people. The handful of men, dotting the streams of women like raisins in a
cheap cake, walked twice as fast as anyone else. Excepting Warders, men got
their business among Aes Sedai done as quickly as possible. Nearly all the
women had their faces hidden, their breath misting in the openings of their
hoods, yet it was easy to pick out Aes Sedai from visitors whether their cloaks
were plain or embroidered and lined with fur. The crowds parted in front of a
sister. Anyone else had to weave her way through. Not that many sisters were
about on this frigid midmorning. Most would be snug in their tents. Alone or in
twos or threes, they would be reading, or writing letters, or questioning their
visitors about whatever information those women had brought. Which might or
might not be shared with the rest of a sister&rsquo;s Ajah, much less with anyone
else.</p>

<p>The world saw Aes Sedai as a monolith, towering and solid, or it had
before the current division in the Tower became common knowledge, yet the pure
fact was that the Ajahs stood apart in all but name, the Hall their only true
meeting point, and the sisters themselves were little more than a convocation
of hermits, speaking three words beyond what was absolutely required only with
a few friends. Or with another sister they had joined in some design. Whatever
else changed about the Tower, Egwene was sure that never would. There was no
point pretending that Aes Sedai had ever been anything but Aes Sedai or ever
would be, a great river rolling onward, all its powerful currents hidden deep,
altering its course with imperceptible slowness. She had built a few hasty dams
in that river, diverting a stream here and a stream there for her own purposes,
yet she knew they were temporary structures. Sooner or later those deep
currents would undercut her dams. She could only pray they lasted long enough.
Pray, and shore up as hard as she could.</p>

<p>Very occasionally one of the Accepted appeared in the throng, with the
seven bands of color on the hood of her white cloak, but most by far were
novices in unadorned white wool. Only a handful of the twenty-one Accepted in
the camp actually possessed banded cloaks, and they saved their few banded
dresses for teaching classes or attending sisters, yet great efforts had been
made to see that every novice was dressed in white at all times, even if she
only had one change. The Accepted inevitably tried to move with the swan-like glide
of Aes Sedai, and one or two nearly managed despite the tilting of the walkways
underfoot, but the novices darted along almost as quickly as the few men,
scurrying on errands or hurrying to classes in groups of six or seven.</p>

<p>Aes Sedai had not had so many novices to teach in a
very long time, not since before the Trolloc Wars, when there had been many
more Aes Sedai as well, and the result of finding themselves with near a
thousand students had been utter confusion until they were organized into these
&ldquo;families.&rdquo; The name was not strictly official, yet it was used even by Aes
Sedai who still disliked taking any woman who asked. Now every novice knew
where she was supposed to be and when, and every sister could at least find
out. Not to mention that the number of runaways had declined. That was always a
concern for Aes Sedai, and several hundred of these women might well attain the
shawl. No sister wanted to lose one of those, or any, for that matter, not
before the decision was made to send a woman away. Women still slipped off
occasionally after realizing that the training was harder than they had
expected and the road to an Aes Sedai&rsquo;s shawl longer, but quite apart from the
families making it easier to keep track, running away seemed to be less attractive
to women who had five or six cousins, as they were called, to lean on.</p>

<p>Well short of the big square pavilion that served as
the Hall of the Tower, she turned Daishar down a side street. The walkway in
front of the pale brown canvas pavilion was empty&mdash;the Hall was not a place
anyone approached without business there&mdash;but the much-patched side curtains
were kept down without a reason to make the workings of the Hall public, so
there was no telling who might step out. Any Sitter would recognize Daishar at
a glance, and some Sitters she would as soon avoid even more than others.
Lelaine and Romanda, for example, who resisted her authority as instinctively
as they opposed each other. Or any of those who had begun talking of
negotiations. It was too much to believe that they were just hoping to
rally spirits, or they would not have kept to whispers. The courtesies had to
be maintained, though, no matter how often she wished she could box someone&rsquo;s
ears, yet no one could think she was being snubbed if Egwene did not see her.</p>

<p>A faint silvery light flashed behind a tall canvas
wall just ahead of her, surrounding one of the camp&rsquo;s two Traveling grounds,
and a moment later two sisters emerged from behind one of the flaps. Neither
Phaedrine nor Shemari was strong enough to weave a gateway by herself, but
linked she thought they could just manage one big enough to walk through. Heads
close together in deep conversation, strangely they were just pinning on their
cloaks. Egwene kept her face averted anyway as she rode by. Both of the Browns
had taught her as a novice, and Phaedrine still seemed surprised that Egwene
was Amyrlin. Lean as a heron, she was quite capable of wading out into the muck
to ask whether Egwene needed assistance. Shemari, a vigorous square-faced
woman who looked more like a Green than a librarian, was always beyond proper
in her behavior. Much beyond. Her deep curtsies, suitable for a novice, carried
at least a suggestion of mockery no matter how smooth her expression, not least
because she had been known to curtsy when she saw Egwene a hundred paces away.</p>

<p>Where had they been, she wondered. Somewhere indoors,
perhaps, or at least warmer than the camp. No one really kept track of the
sisters&rsquo; comings and goings, of course, not even the Ajahs. Custom ruled
everyone, and custom strongly discouraged direct questions about what a sister
was doing or where she was going. Most likely, Phaedrine and Shemari had been
to hear from some of their eyes-and-ears face to face. Or maybe to look at a
book in some library. They <em>were</em> Brown. But she could not help thinking
of Nisao&rsquo;s comment about sisters slipping away to Elaida. It was quite possible
to hire a boatman to make the crossing to the city, where dozens of tiny water
gates gave entrance to anyone who wished it, but with a gateway, there was no
need to risk exposure by riding to the river and asking after boats. Just one
sister returning to the Tower with the knowledge of that weave would give away
their largest advantage. And there was no way to stop it. Except to keep heart
in the opposition to Elaida. Except to make the sisters believe there could be
a quick end to this. If only there was a way to a quick end.</p>

<p>Not far beyond the Traveling ground, Egwene drew rein
and frowned at a long wall-tent, even more patched than the Hall. An Aes Sedai
came swanning down the walkway&mdash;she wore a plain dark blue cloak, and the cowl
hid her face, but novices and others skipped out of her way as they never would
have for a merchant, say&mdash;and paused in front of the tent, looking at it for a
long moment before pushing aside the entry flap to go inside, her unwillingness
as clear as if she had shouted. Egwene had never gone in there. She could feel <em>saidar</em>
being channeled inside, though faintly. The amount necessary was surprisingly
small. A quick visit from the Amyrlin should not draw too much attention,
however. She very much wanted to see what she had set in motion.</p>

<p>Dismounting in front of the tent, though, she discovered a trifling
difficulty. There was nowhere to tie Daishar. The Amyrlin always had someone
rushing to hold her stirrup and take away her horse, but she stood there
holding the gelding&rsquo;s reins, and clusters of novices bustled past with no more
than a quick glance, dismissing her as one of the visitors. By this time,
every novice knew all of the Accepted on sight, but few had seen the Amyrlin
Seat close up. She did not even have the ageless face to tell them she was Aes
Sedai. With a rueful laugh, she put a gloved hand into her belt pouch. The
stole would tell them who she was, and then she could order one of them to hold
her horse for a few minutes. Unless they thought it was a joke in bad taste, at
least. Some of the novices from Emond&rsquo;s Field had tried to pull the stole from
her neck, to keep her from getting in trouble. No, that was past and dealt
with.</p>

<p>Abruptly, the entry flap was pushed open and Leane emerged, fastening
her dark green cloak with a silver pin in the shape of a fish. The cloak was
silk, and richly embroidered in silver and gold, as was the bodice of her
riding dress. Her red gloves were embroidered on the backs, too. Leane paid
minute attention to her clothes since joining the Green Ajah. Her eyes widened
lightly at the sight of Egwene, but her coppery face smoothed immediately.
Taking in the situation at a glance, she put out a hand to stop a novice who
appeared to be by herself. Novices went to classes by family. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your
name, child?&rdquo; Much had changed about Leane, but not her briskness. Except when
she wanted it to, anyway. Most men turned to putty when Leane&rsquo;s voice grew
languorous, but she never wasted that on women. &ldquo;Are you on an errand for a
sister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The novice, a pale-eyed woman close to her middle years, with an
unblemished skin that had never seen a day&rsquo;s work in the field, gaped openly
before recovering enough to make her curtsy, a smoothly practiced spreading of
her white skirts with mittened hands. As tall as most men but willowy and
graceful and beautiful, Leane lacked the ageless look, too, yet hers was one of
the two most well known faces in the camp. Novices pointed her out in awe, a
sister who had once been Keeper, who had been stilled, and Healed so she could
channel again, if not so strongly as before. And then she had changed Ajahs!
The newest women in white already had learned that that just never happened,
though the other was becoming a part of lore, unfortunately. It was harder to
make a novice go slowly when you could not point out that she risked ending
her quest for the shawl by burning herself out and losing the One Power
forever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Letice Murow, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; the woman said
respectfully, in a lilting Murandian accent. She sounded as if she wanted to
say more, perhaps to give a title, but one of the first lessons on joining the
Tower was that you had left behind who you used to be. It was a hard lesson,
for some, especially those who possessed titles. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to visit my sister.
I haven&rsquo;t seen her more than a minute since before we left Murandy.&rdquo; Relatives
were always put in different novice families, as were women who had known each
other before being entered in the novice book. It encouraged making new
friends, and cut down on the inevitable tensions when one was learning faster
than the other or had a higher potential. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s free of classes, too, until
the afternoon, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your sister will have to wait a while longer, child,&rdquo; Leane broke in.
&ldquo;Hold the Amyrlin&rsquo;s horse for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letice gave a start and stared at Egwene, who had finally managed to
extract her stole. Handing Daishar&rsquo;s reins to the woman, she lowered her cowl
and settled the long narrow strip of cloth onto her shoulders. Light as a
feather in her pouch, the stole had real weight hanging around her neck. Siuan
claimed that sometimes you could feel every woman who had ever worn the stole
hanging from the ends of it, a constant reminder of responsibility and duty,
and Egwene believed every word. The Murandian gaped at her harder than she had
for Leane, and took longer to remember to curtsy. No doubt she had heard that
the Amyrlin was young, but it seemed unlikely she had given a thought to how
young.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, child,&rdquo; Egwene said smoothly. There had
been a time when she felt strange calling a woman ten years older than herself
child. Everything changed, with time. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be for long. Leane, would you
ask someone to send a groom for Daishar? Now that I&rsquo;m out of the saddle, I&rsquo;d as
soon stay out, and Letice should be allowed to see her sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will see to it myself, Mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leane offered a fluid curtsy and moved away with never
a hint that there was more between them than this chance encounter. Egwene
trusted her far more than she did Anaiya or even Sheriam. She certainly kept no
secrets from Leane, any more than from Siuan. But their friendship was yet
another secret that had to be kept. For one thing, Leane had eyes-and-ears
actually inside Tar Valon if not in the Tower itself, and their reports came to
Egwene and Egwene alone. For another, Leane was much petted for accommodating
so well to her reduced status, and every sister welcomed her, if only because
she was living proof that stilling, the deepest dread of any Aes Sedai, could
be reversed. They welcomed her with open arms, and because she <em>was</em> less,
now, standing below at least half the sisters in the camp, they often spoke in
front of her about matters they would never want the Amyrlin to know of. So
Egwene did not so much as glance after her as she left. Instead, she, offered
Letice a smile&mdash;the woman reddened and bobbed another curtsy&mdash;then entered
the tent, stripping off her gloves and tucking them behind her belt.</p>

<p>Inside, eight mirrored stand-lamps stood along the walls between low
wooden chests. One with a bit of worn gilding and the rest of painted iron, no
two of the lamps had the same number of arms, but they provided good illumination,
if not so bright as outside. Assorted tables that seemed to have come from
seven different farm kitchens made a row down the center of the canvas
ground-cloth, the benches of the three farthest occupied by a half a dozen
novices with their cloaks folded beside them, each woman surrounded by the glow
of the Power. Tiana, the Mistress of Novices, hovered anxiously over them,
walking between the tables, and surprisingly, so did Sharina Melloy, one of the
novices acquired in Murandy.</p>

<p>Well, Sharina was not exactly hovering, just watching calmly, and
perhaps it should not have been a surprise to find her there. A dignified,
gray-haired grandmother with a tight bun on the back of her head, Sharina had
run a very large family with a very firm hand, and she seemed to have adopted
all of the other novices as granddaughters or grandnieces. She was the one who
had organized them into those tiny families, completely on her own and apparently
out of simple disgust at seeing everyone flounder around. Most Aes Sedai went
more than a touch tight-mouthed if reminded of that, though they had accepted
the form quickly enough once they realized how much easier it made keeping
track and organizing classes. Tiana was inspecting the novices&rsquo; work so closely
that it seemed obvious she was attempting to ignore Sharina&rsquo;s presence. Short
and slight, with large brown eyes and a dimple in her cheek, Tiana somehow
looked young despite her ageless face, particularly alongside the taller
novice&rsquo;s creased cheeks and broad hips.</p>

<p>The pair of Aes Sedai channeling at the table nearest the entrance,
Kairen and Ashmanaille, had an audience of two as well, Janya Frende, a Sitter
for the Brown, and Salita Toranes, a Sitter for the Yellow. The Aes Sedai and
the novices were all performing the same task. In front of each woman, a close
net woven of Earth, Fire and Air surrounded a small bowl or cup or the like,
all made by the camp&rsquo;s blacksmiths, who were very puzzled at why the sisters
wanted such things made of iron, not to mention having them made as finely as
if they were silver. A second weave, Earth and Fire woven just so, penetrated
each net to touch the object, which was slowly turning white. Very, very
slowly, in every case.</p>

<p>Ability with the weave improved with practice, but of the Five Powers,
strength in Earth was the key, and beside Egwene herself, only nine sisters in
the camp&mdash;along with two of the Accepted and nearly two dozen novices&mdash;had
sufficient of that to make the weaves work at all. Few among the sisters wanted
to give any time to it, though. Ashmanaille, lean enough to make her seem
taller than she really was, fingers tapping the tabletop on either side of the
simple metal cup in front her, was frowning impatiently as the edge of
whiteness crept upward past halfway. Kairen&rsquo;s blue eyes were cold enough that
it seemed her stare alone might shatter the tall goblet she was working on.
That had only the smallest rim of white at the bottom. It must have been Kairen
Egwene had seen going in.</p>

<p>Not everyone was unenthusiastic, though. Janya, slim in her pale bronze
silks and wearing her brown-fringed shawl draped over her arms, studied what
Kairen and Ashmanaille were doing with the eagerness of one who wished she
could be doing the same. Janya wanted to know everything, to know how everything
was done and why it happened that way. She had been extremely disappointed when
she could not learn to make <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>&mdash;only three sisters aside from
Elayne had managed that, so far, with very spotty success&mdash;and she had made a
concerted effort to learn this skill even after the testing showed she fell
short of the required strength in using Earth.</p>

<p>Salita was the first to notice Egwene. Round-faced and almost as dark as
charcoal, she eyed Egwene levelly, and the Yellow fringe of her shawl swayed
slightly as she made a very precise curtsy, exact to the inch. Raised in
Salidar, Salita was part of a disturbing pattern: too many Sitters who were
too young for the position. Salita had only been Aes Sedai for thirty-five
years, and rarely was a woman given a chair before wearing the shawl for a
hundred or more. Siuan saw a pattern, anyway, and thought it disturbing, though
she could not say why. Patterns she could not understand always disturbed
Siuan. Still, Salita had stood for war against Elaida, and frequently supported
Egwene in the Hall. But not always, and not in this. &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; she said coolly.</p>

<p>Janya&rsquo;s head jerked up, and she broke into a beaming
smile. She also had stood for war, the only woman who had been a Sitter before
the Tower divided to do so excepting Lelaine and Lyrelle, two of the Blues, and
if her support for Egwene was not always unwavering, it was so here. As usual,
words spilled out of her. &ldquo;I will never get over this, Mother. It&rsquo;s simply
amazing. I know we shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised any longer when you come up with something
no one else has thought of&mdash;sometimes I think we&rsquo;ve gotten too set in our
ways, too sure what can and cannot be done&mdash;but to puzzle out how to make <em>cuendillar</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&rdquo; She paused for breath, and Salita moved into the gap smoothly. And
coldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I still say it is wrong,&rdquo; she said firmly. &ldquo;I admit the discovery was a
brilliant piece of work on your part, Mother, but Aes Sedai should not be
making things for&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;sale.&rdquo; Salita invested that word with all the scorn of
a woman who accepted the income from her estate in Tear without ever thinking
how it had been come by. The attitude was not uncommon, though most sisters
lived on the Tower&rsquo;s generous yearly allowance. Or had, before the Tower split
apart. &ldquo;On top of which,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;nearly half the sisters forced into
this are Yellow. I receive complaints every day. We, at least, have more
important uses for our time than making&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;trinkets.&rdquo; That earned her a
hard glare from Ashmanaille, a Gray, and a frigid stare from Kairen, who was
Blue, but Salita ignored them. She was one of those Yellows who seemed to think
the other Ajahs were only adjuncts to her own, which of course had the only
truly useful purpose among them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And novices should not be doing weaves of this
complexity at all,&rdquo; Tiana added, joining them. The Mistress of Novices was
never shy about speaking up to Sitters, or to the Amyrlin, and she wore a
disgruntled expression. She did not appear to realize that it deepened her
dimple and made her look sulky. &ldquo;It <em>is</em> a remarkable discovery, and I
for one have no objections to trade, but some of these girls can barely manage
to make a ball of fire change color with any surety. Letting them handle weaves
like this will only make it more difficult to stop them from leaping to things
they can&rsquo;t handie, and the Light knows, that&rsquo;s difficult enough already. They
may even do themselves an injury.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, nonsense,&rdquo; Janya exclaimed, waving a slender hand as if to
brush away the very idea. &ldquo;Every girl who&rsquo;s been chosen can already make three
balls of fire at once, and this requires very little more of the Power. There&rsquo;s
no danger at all, so long as they&rsquo;re under a sister&rsquo;s supervision, and they
always are. I&rsquo;ve seen the roster. Besides, what we make in a day will bring
enough to pay the army for a week or more, but the sisters alone can&rsquo;t produce
near that much.&rdquo; Squinting slightly, she suddenly appeared to be looking
through Tiana. The cascade from her tongue never slowed, yet she seemed to be
talking at least half to herself. &ldquo;We will have to take great care in the
selling. The Sea Folk have a voracious appetite for <em>cuendillar</em>, and
there are plenty of their ships still at Illian and Tear by all accounts&mdash;the
nobles there are greedy for it, too&mdash;but even ravenous appetites have limits.
I still cannot decide whether it will be best to appear with everything at
once, or let it trickle out. Sooner or later, even the price of <em>cuendillar</em> will
begin to drop.&rdquo; Abruptly she blinked and peered first at Tiana then at Salita,
tilting her head to one side. &ldquo;You do see my point, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Salita glowered and hitched her shawl up on her shoulders. Tiana threw
up her hands in exasperation. Egwene held her peace. For once, she felt no
shame at being praised for one of her supposed discoveries. Unlike nearly
everything else except Traveling, this one actually was hers, though Moghedien
had pointed the way before she escaped. The woman did not know how to actually
make anything&mdash;at least, she had not revealed any such knowledge however hard
Egwene had pressed her, and she had pressed <em>very</em> hard&mdash;but Moghedien
had a wide streak of greed, and even in the Age of Legends, <em>cuendillar</em> had
been a prized luxury. She had known enough of how it was made for Egwene to
puzzle out the rest. In any case, no matter who objected or how strenuously,
the need for money meant the production of <em>cuendillar</em> would continue.
Though as far as she was concerned, the longer before any of it was sold, the
better.</p>

<p>Sharina slapping her hands together loudly in the back
of the tent jerked everyone&rsquo;s head that way. Kairen and Ashmanaille turned, too, the Blue even letting her weaves go so
the goblet bounced on the tabletop with a metallic clatter. It was a sign of
boredom. The process could be started over, though finding the precise point
was very hard, and some sisters took every opportunity to do anything else
during the hour they had to spend in the tent each day. An hour or until they
completed one item start to finish, whichever came first. That was supposed to
push them to try harder at increasing their skill, but few had progressed very
far.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bodewhin, Nicola, off to your next class,&rdquo; Sharina
announced. She did not speak loudly, but her voice had a strength that could
have cut through a babble of voices much less the quiet of the tent. &ldquo;You have
just time to wash your hands and faces. Quickly, now. You don&rsquo;t want any bad
reports.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bode&mdash;Bodewhin&mdash;moved with efficient alacrity,
releasing <em>saidar</em> and placing her half-made <em>cuendillar</em> bracelet in
one of the chests along the wall for someone else to finish, then gathering her
cloak. Plump-cheeked and pretty, she wore her hair in a long dark braid, though
Egwene was not sure she had gotten permission from the Women&rsquo;s Circle. But
then, that world was behind her, now. Tugging on her mittens as she hurried
from the tent, Bode kept her eyes down and never glanced in Egwene&rsquo;s direction.
Plainly, she still did not understand why a novice could not drop by to chat
with the Amyrlin Seat whenever she wanted, even if they had grown up together.</p>

<p>Egwene would have loved to talk with Bode and some of the others, but an
Amyrlin had lessons to learn, too. An Amyrlin had many duties, few friends, and
no favorites. Besides, even the appearance of favoritism would mark the Two
Rivers girls out and make their lives with the other novices a misery. <em>And
it wouldn&rsquo;t do me much good with the Hall, either</em>, she thought wryly. She
did wish the Two Rivers girls understood, though.</p>

<p>The other novice Sharina had named did not leave her bench or stop
channeling. Nicola&rsquo;s black eyes flashed at Sharina. &ldquo;I could be the best at
this if I was ever allowed to really practice,&rdquo; she grumbled sullenly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
getting better; I know I am. I can Foretell, you know.&rdquo; As if the one had
anything to do with the other. &ldquo;Tiana Sedai, tell her I can stay longer. I can
finish this bowl before my next class, and I&rsquo;m sure Adine Sedai won&rsquo;t mind if
I&rsquo;m just a little late.&rdquo; If her class was any time soon, she would
be more than a little late if she tarried to complete the bowl; her hour&rsquo;s
effort had turned only half of it white.</p>

<p>Tiana
opened her mouth, but before she could utter a word, Sharina raised one finger,
then a moment later, a second. It must have had some particular significance,
because Nicola went pale and let go of her weaves on the instant, leaping up so
quickly that she joggled the bench, earning quick frowns from the other two
novices who shared it. They bent quickly back to their work, though, and Nicola
almost ran to thrust the half-done bowl into a chest before snatching up her
cloak. To Egwene&rsquo;s surprise, a woman she had not seen, dressed in a short brown
coat and wide trousers, jumped up from where she had been sitting on the
ground-cloth beyond the tables. Scowling blue-eyed daggers at everyone in
sight, Areina ran out of the tent after Nicola, the two women mirror images of
disgruntlement and discontent. Seeing the pair of them together made Egwene
uneasy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t know friends were allowed in here to watch,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Is Nicola still
causing problems?&rdquo; Nicola and Areina had attempted to blackmail her, and
Myrelle and Nisao, but that was not what she meant. That was still another
secret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better the
girl&rsquo;s friendly with Areina than with one of the male grooms,&rdquo; Tiana said with
a sniff. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had two get with child, you know, and ten more likely to. The
girl needs more friends, though. Friends will do the trick with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She
cut off as two more white-clad novices hurried into the tent, the pair of them
squeaking and skidding to a halt when they found Aes Sedai standing right in
front of them. Hastily dropping curtsies, they scuttled to the back of the tent
at a gesture from Tiana and folded their cloaks on a bench before fetching a
partly white goblet and an almost white cup from one of the chests.</p>

<p>Sharina
saw them settled to work, then gathered her own cloak and swung it around her
shoulders before coming up the tent. &ldquo;If you will excuse me, Tiana Sedai,&rdquo; she
said, making a curtsy that just came short of being to an equal, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
told off to help with the midday meal today, and I wouldn&rsquo;t want to get
crosswise with the cooks.&rdquo; Her dark eyes rested on Egwene for a brief moment,
and she nodded to herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go
on, then,&rdquo; Tiana said sharply. &ldquo;I would hate to hear you had been switched for
being late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without
turning a hair, Sharina offered her courtesies again, neither in a hurry nor
dragging it out, to Tiana, to the Sitters, to Egwene&mdash;with another glance that
was penetrating but too short for offense&mdash;and when the tentflap swung shut
behind her, Tiana blew out her cheeks in exasperation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nicola
causes less trouble than some,&rdquo; she said darkly, and Janya shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sharina
doesn&rsquo;t cause problems, Tiana.&rdquo; She spoke as quickly as ever, but quietly, so
her voice would not carry to the back of the tent. Disagreements between
sisters were never aired in front of novices. Especially when the disagreement
was over a novice. &ldquo;She already knows the rules better than any Accepted, and
never puts a toe over the line. She never shirks at even the dirtiest chores,
either, and she&rsquo;s the first to lend a hand when another novice needs one.
Sharina is simply who she is. Light, you can&rsquo;t allow a <em>novice</em> to
intimidate you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tiana
stiffened and opened her mouth angrily, but once Janya had the bit between her
teeth, getting a word in edgewise was no easy matter. &ldquo;Nicola, on the other
hand, causes all sorts of problems, Mother,&rdquo; the Brown rushed on. &ldquo;Ever since
we found out she has the Foretelling, she&rsquo;s been Foretelling two or three times
a day, to hear her tell it. Or rather, to hear Areina tell it. Nicola is smart
enough to know everyone is aware she can&rsquo;t remember what she says when she
Foretells, but Areina always seems to be there to hear and remember, and help
her interpret. Some are the sort of thing anyone in the camp with half a brain
and a credulous nature might think of&mdash;battles with the Seanchan or the
Asha&rsquo;man, an Amyrlin imprisoned, the Dragon Reborn doing nine impossible
things, visions that might be Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don or a bilious stomach&mdash;and the rest
all just happen to indicate that Nicola ought to be allowed to go faster with
her lessons. She&rsquo;s always too greedy for that. I think even most of the other
novices have stopped believing her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She
also pokes her nose everywhere,&rdquo; Salita put in the moment Janya gave her an
opening, &ldquo;her and the groom, both.&rdquo; Her face remained smooth and cool, and she
shifted her shawl as though that were
the focus of her attention, but she rushed her words a little, perhaps fearing
that the Brown would take over again. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve both been switched for
eavesdropping on sisters, and I myself caught Nicola trying to peek into one of
the Traveling grounds. She said she just wanted to see a gateway open, but I
think she was trying to learn the weave. Impatience, I can understand, but
deceit cannot be tolerated. I no longer believe Nicola will attain the shawl,
and frankly, I&rsquo;ve begun to wonder whether she should be sent away soon rather
than late. The novice book may be open to everyone,&rdquo; she finished with an
expressionless glance at Egwene, &ldquo;but we do not have to lower our standards
completely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Glaring, Tiana pursed her lips stubbornly, emphasizing
her dimple again. You could almost forget she had worn the shawl for over
thirty years and think her a novice herself. &ldquo;As long as I am Mistress of
Novices, the decision on whether to send a girl away is mine,&rdquo; she said
heatedly, &ldquo;and I do not intend to lose a girl of Nicola&rsquo;s potential.&rdquo; Nicola
would be very strong in the Power, one day. &ldquo;Or Sharina&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she added with a
grimace, hands smoothing her skirts in irritation. Sharina&rsquo;s potential was
nothing short of remarkable, far beyond anyone in living memory except for
Nynaeve, and ahead of Nynaeve as well. Some thought she might become as strong
as it was possible to be, though that was only speculation. &ldquo;If Nicola has been
bothering you, Mother, I will see to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just curious,&rdquo; Egwene said carefully,
swallowing a suggestion that the young woman and her friend both be watched
closely. She did not want to talk about Nicola. It would be too easy to find
herself with a choice between lying or revealing matters she dared not expose.
A pity she had not allowed Siuan to arrange for two quiet deaths.</p>

<p>Her head jerked in shock at the thought. Had she gone that far from
Emond&rsquo;s Field? She knew she would have to order men to die in battle sooner or
later, and she thought she might be able to order a death if the need was great
enough. If one death could stop the death of thousands, or even hundreds, was
it not right to order it? But the danger presented by Nicola and Areina was
simply that they might reveal secrets that could inconvenience Egwene al&rsquo;Vere.
Oh, Myrelle and the others might be lucky to get off with a birching, and they
would certainly consider that more than inconvenient, but discomfort, however
great, was <em>not</em> sufficient reason for killing.</p>

<p>Abruptly, Egwene realized that she was frowning, and Tiana and the two
Sitters were watching her, Janya not bothering to hide her curiosity behind a
mask of serenity. To cover herself, Egwene shifted her frown to the table where
Kairen and Ashmanaille were once more at work. The white on Ashmanaille&rsquo;s cup
had climbed a little farther, but in just that short time, Kairen had caught
up. More than caught up, in fact, since her goblet stood twice as high as the
cup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your skill is improving, Kairen,&rdquo; Egwene said approvingly.</p>

<p>The Blue looked up at her, and drew a deep breath. Her
oval face became an image of cool calm around those icy blue eyes. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t
much skill involved, Mother. All that&rsquo;s needed is to set the weave and wait.&rdquo;
The last word held a touch of acridness, and for that matter, there had been a
slight hesitation before Mother. Kairen had been sent off from Salidar on a
very important mission only to see it collapse in a shambles, though from no
fault of hers, and she had returned to them in Murandy to find everything she
had left behind stood on its head and a girl she remembered as a novice wearing
the Amyrlin&rsquo;s stole. Of late, Kairen had been spending a good deal of time with
Lelaine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is improving; in <em>some</em> things,&rdquo; Janya said with a pointed
frown for the Blue sister. Janya might have been as sure as any other Sitter
that the Hall was getting a puppet when they raised Egwene, but she seemed to
have accepted that Egwene did wear the stole, and deserved the proper respect
from everyone. &ldquo;Of course, I doubt she&rsquo;ll catch Leane unless she applies
herself, much less yourself, Mother. Young Bodewhin might catch her, in fact. I
wouldn&rsquo;t want to be outdone by a novice, myself, but I suppose some don&rsquo;t feel
that way.&rdquo; A stain of red crept into Kairen&rsquo;s cheeks, and her eyes dropped to
the goblet.</p>

<p>Tiana sniffed. &ldquo;Bodewhin&rsquo;s a good girl, but she spends more time
giggling and playing with the other novices than applying herself if Sha&mdash;&rdquo;
She inhaled sharply. &ldquo;If she isn&rsquo;t watched. Yesterday, she and Althyn Conly
tried two items at once, just to see what would happen, and the things fused
together in a solid lump. Useless for sale, of course, unless you find someone
who wants a pair of half-iron <em>cuendillar</em> cups joined at angles. And the
Light knows what might have happened to the girls. They didn&rsquo;t seem to be
harmed, but who can say about the next time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make sure there isn&rsquo;t a next time,&rdquo; Egwene said absently, her attention
on Kairen&rsquo;s cup. The line of white crept upward steadily. When Leane did this
weave, black iron turned to white <em>cuendillar</em> as if the iron were sinking
quickly into milk. For Egwene herself, the change was faster than the blink of
an eye, black to white in a flash. It would have to be Kairen and Leane, but
