<h4><em>Whirlpools of Color</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">P</span>errin did not realize he had moved until he found
 himself crouched over Stepper&rsquo;s neck, streaking after Arganda. The snow was
 no less deep, the ground no smoother, the light no better, but Stepper raced
 through the shadows, unwilling to let the roan stay in the lead, and Perrin
 urged him to run faster. The approaching rider was Elyas, his beard fanned
 out over his chest, a broad-brimmed hat casting his face in shadows and his
 fur-lined cloak hanging down his back. The Aiel was one of the Maidens, with
 a dark <em>shoufa</em> wrapped around her head and a white cloak, used for
 hiding against the snow, worn over her coat and breeches of grays and browns
 and greens. Elyas and one Maiden, without the others, meant Faile had been
 found. It had to.</p>

<p>Arganda ran his horse without a care for whether he
broke the roan&rsquo;s neck or his own, leaping stone outcrops, splashing through the
snow at a near-gallop, but Stepper overtook him just as he reached Elyas and
demanded in a harsh voice, &ldquo;Did you see the queen, Machera? Is she alive? Tell
me, man!&rdquo; The Maiden, Elienda, her sun-darkened face expressionless, raised a
hand to Perrin. It might have been meant for a greeting, or sympathy, but she
never broke her skimming stride. With
Elyas to make his report to Perrin, she would carry hers to the Wise Ones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve found her?&rdquo; Perrin&rsquo;s throat was suddenly dry as sand. He had
waited so long for this. Arganda snarled soundlessly through the steel bars of
his helmet&rsquo;s faceguard, knowing that Perrin was not asking after Alliandre.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We found the Shaido we&rsquo;ve been following,&rdquo; Elyas said carefully, both
hands on the pommel of his saddle. Even Elyas, the fabled Long Tooth who had
lived and run with wolves, was showing the strain of too many miles and not
enough sleep. His whole face sagged with a weariness emphasized by the
golden-yellow glow of his eyes beneath his hat brim. Gray streaked his thick
beard and the hair that he wore hanging to his waist and tied with a leather
cord at the nape of his neck, and for the first time since Perrin had known
him, he looked old. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re camped around a fair-sized town they took, in
ridge country near forty miles from here. They&rsquo;ve got no sentries to speak of
close in, and those further out seem to be watching for prisoners trying to
escape more than anything else, so we got near enough for a good look. But
Perrin, there are more of them than we thought. At least nine or ten septs, the
Maidens say. Counting <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>&mdash;folks in white, anyway&mdash;there could
be as many people in that camp as in Mayene or Ebou Dar. I don&rsquo;t know how many
spear fighters, but ten thousand might be on the low side from what I saw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Knots of desperation twisted and tightened in Perrin&rsquo;s stomach. His
mouth was so dry he could not have spoken had Faile miraculously appeared in
front of him. Ten thousand <em>algai&rsquo;d&rsquo;siswai</em>, and even weavers and
silversmiths and old men who passed their days reminiscing in the shade would
pick up a spear if they were attacked. He had fewer than two thousand lancers,
and they would have been overmatched against an equal number of Aiel. Fewer
than three hundred Two Rivers men, who could wreak havoc with their bows at a
distance but not stop ten thousand. That many Shaido would shred Masema&rsquo;s
murderous rabble like a cat slaughtering a nest of mice. Even counting the
Asha&rsquo;man and the Wise Ones and Aes Sedai&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Edarra and the other Wise Ones
were hardly generous in what they told him about Wise Ones, but he knew ten
septs might have fifty women who could channel, maybe more. Maybe fewer, too&mdash;there was no set number&mdash;but not enough
fewer to make a difference.</p>

<p>With an effort, he strangled the despair welling up in
him, squeezed until only writhing filaments remained for his anger to burn up.
A hammer had no place in it for despair. Ten septs or the whole Shaido clan,
they still had Faile, and he still had to find a way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does it matter how many there are?&rdquo; Aram demanded. &ldquo;When Trollocs
came to the Two Rivers, there were thousands, tens of thousands, but we killed
them just the same. Shaido can&rsquo;t be worse than Trollocs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin blinked, surprised to find the man right behind him, not to
mention Berelain and Gallenne and the Aes Sedai. In his haste to reach Elyas,
he had shut out everything else. Dimly visible through the trees, the men
Arganda had brought out to confront Masema still held their rough lines, but
Berelain&rsquo;s bodyguard was forming a loose ring centered on Elyas and facing
outward. The Wise Ones stood outside the circle, listening to Elienda with
grave faces. She spoke in a low murmur, sometimes shaking her head. Her view of
matters was no brighter than Elyas&rsquo;s. He must have lost the basket in his
haste, or thrown it away, because it hung from Berelain&rsquo;s saddle now. There was
a look of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;could it be sympathy, on her face? Burn him, he was too tired
to think straight. Only, now more than ever, he had to think straight. His next
mistake might be the last, for Faile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Way I heard it, Tinker,&rdquo; Elyas said quietly, &ldquo;the Trollocs came to you
in the Two Rivers, and you managed to catch them in a vise. You have any fancy
plans for catching the Shaido in a vise?&rdquo; Aram glared at him sullenly. Elyas
had known him before he picked up a sword, and Aram disliked being reminded of
that time, despite his brightly colored clothes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten septs or fifty,&rdquo; Arganda growled, &ldquo;there must be some way to free
the Queen. And the others, of course. And the others.&rdquo; His hard-bitten face was
creased in a scowl of anger, yet he smelled frantic, a fox ready chew off its
own leg to escape a trap. &ldquo;Will&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Will they accept a ransom?&rdquo; The
Ghealdanin looked around until he found Marline coming through the Winged
Guards. She managed a steady stride in spite of the snow, not staggering in
the least. The other Wise Ones were no longer anywhere to be seen among the
trees, nor Elienda. &ldquo;Will these Shaido take a ransom&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Wise One?&rdquo; Arganda&rsquo;s
honorific had the sound of an afterthought. He no longer believed the Aiel with
them had any knowledge of the kidnapping, but there was a taint in him
regarding Aiel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot say.&rdquo; Marline seemed not to notice his tone.
Arms folded across her chest, she stood looking at Perrin rather than Arganda.
It was one of those looks where a woman weighed and measured you till she could
have sewn you a suit of clothes or told you when your smallclothes were last
washed. It would have made him uncomfortable back when he had had time for such
things. When she spoke again, there was nothing of offering advice in her tone,
merely a setting out of the facts. She might even have meant it so. &ldquo;Your
wetlander paying of ransom goes against our custom. <em>Gai&rsquo;shain</em> may be
given as a gift, or traded for other <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>, but they are not animals
to be sold. Yet it seems the Shaido no longer follow <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh.</em> They make
wetlanders <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> and take everything instead of only the fifth. They
may set a price.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My jewels are at your disposal, Perrin,&rdquo; Berelain put
in, her voice steady and her face firm. &ldquo;If necessary, Grady or Neald can fetch
more from Mayene. Gold, as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gallenne cleared his throat. &ldquo;Altarans are used to
marauders, my Lady, neighboring nobles and brigands alike,&rdquo; he said slowly,
slapping his reins against his palm. Although reluctant to contradict
Berelain, he clearly intended to anyway. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no law this far from Ebou
Dar, except what the local lord or lady says. Noble or common, they&rsquo;re
accustomed to paying off anyone they can&rsquo;t fight off, and quick to tell the
difference. It goes against reason that none of them tried to buy safety, yet
we&rsquo;ve seen nothing but ruins in these Shaido&rsquo;s path, heard of nothing but
pillage right down to the ground. They may accept an offer of ransom, and even
take it, but can they be trusted to give anything in return? Just making the
offer gives away our one real advantage, that they don&rsquo;t know we are here.&rdquo;
Annoura shook her head slightly, the barest movement,
but Gallenne&rsquo;s one eye caught it, and he frowned. &ldquo;You disagree, Annoura
Sedai?&rdquo; he asked politely. And with a hint of surprise.</p>

<p>The Gray was almost diffident at times, especially for
a sister, but she never vacillated about speaking up when she disagreed with
advice offered to Berelain.</p>

<p>This time Annoura hesitated, though, and covered by
pulling her cloak around herself and arranging the folds with care. It was
clumsy of her; Aes Sedai could ignore heat or cold when they chose, remaining
untouched when everyone around them was drenched with sweat or fighting to stop
their teeth chattering. An Aes Sedai who paid attention to the temperature was
buying time to think, usually about how to hide what she was thinking. Glancing
toward Marline with a small frown, she finally reached a decision, and the
slight crease in her forehead vanished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Negotiation is always better than fighting,&rdquo; she said
in cool Taraboner accents, &ldquo;and in negotiation, trust is always a matter of the
precautions, yes? We must consider with care the precautions that must be
taken. There is also the question of who is to approach them. Wise Ones may no
longer be sacrosanct, since they took part in the battle at Dumai&rsquo;s Wells. A
sister, or a group of sisters, might be better, yet even that must have
careful arrangement. I myself am willing to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No ransom,&rdquo; Perrin said, and when everyone stared at
him, most in consternation, Annoura with her face unreadable, he said it again,
in a harder voice. &ldquo;No ransom.&rdquo; He would not pay these Shaido for making Faile
suffer. She would be afraid, and they had to pay for that, not profit from it.
Besides, Gallenne had the right of it. Nothing Perrin had seen, in Altara or
Amadicia or before that in Cairhien, so much as hinted that the Shaido could be
trusted to keep any bargain. As well trust rats in the grain bins and cutworms
with the harvest. &ldquo;Elyas, I want to see their camp.&rdquo; When he was a boy he had
known a blind man, Nat Torfinn with his wrinkled face and thin white hair, who
could disassemble any blacksmith&rsquo;s puzzle by touch. For years Perrin tried to
learn how to duplicate that feat, but he never could. He had to see how the
pieces fit together before he could make sense of them. &ldquo;Aram, find Grady and
tell him to meet me as fast as he can, at the Traveling ground.&rdquo; That was what
they had come to call the place where they arrived at the end of each jump, and
departed from for the next. It was easier for the Asha&rsquo;man to weave a gateway
in a place already touched by one they had woven before.</p>

<p>Aram gave one short, purposeful nod, then wheeled his
gray and sped toward camp, but Perrin could see arguments and questions
and demands gathering on the faces around him. Marline was still examining him,
as though suddenly not quite sure what he was, and Gallenne was frowning at the
reins in his hands, no doubt seeing matters turn out badly whatever he did, but
Berelain wore a perturbed expression, objections visible in her eyes, and
Annoura&rsquo;s mouth had tightened to a thin line. Aes Sedai disliked being interrupted,
and, diffident for an Aes Sedai or not, she looked ready to vent her
displeasure. Arganda, his face growing red, opened his mouth with the clear
intention of shouting. Arganda had shouted often since his queen was kidnapped.
There was no point in waiting to listen.</p>

<p>Digging
in his heels, Perrin sent Stepper lunging through the line of Winged Guards,
heading back toward the sheared trees. Not at a run, but not dawdling, either&mdash;a quick trot through the towering forests, hands tight on the reins and eyes
already searching the dappled gloom for Grady. Elyas followed on his gelding
without a word. Perrin had been sure he had no room in him for another ounce of
fear, yet Elyas&rsquo; silence made the weight grow. The other man never saw an
obstacle without seeing a way around. His silence shouted of impassable
mountains. There had to be a way, though. When they reached the smooth stone
outcrop, Perrin walked Stepper back and forth through the slanting bars of
light, around the toppled trees and between the standing ones, unable to make
himself stop. He had to keep moving. There had to be a way. His mind darted
like a caged rat.</p>

<p>Elyas
dismounted to squat and frown at the sliced stone, paying little heed to his
gelding tugging at the reins and trying to back away. Beside the stone, the
thick trunk of a pine that had stood a good fifty paces tall was propped up at
one end by the splintered remains of its stump, high enough that Elyas could
have walked beneath the tree trunk upright. Brilliant rays of sunlight piercing
the forest canopy elsewhere seemed to deepen the shadow to near blackness
around the track-marked outcrop but that troubled him no more than it did
Perrin. His nose wrinkled at the burnt-sulphur smell that still hung in the
air. &ldquo;I thought I caught this stink on the way here. I expect you&rsquo;d have
mentioned this if you didn&rsquo;t have things on your mind. A big pack. Bigger than
anything I&rsquo;ve ever seen or heard of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Masuri said,&rdquo; Perrin said absently. What
was keeping Grady? How many people were there in Ebou Dar? That was the size of
the Shaido camp. &ldquo;She said she&rsquo;s crossed the paths of seven packs, and this
isn&rsquo;t one she&rsquo;s seen before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seven,&rdquo; Elyas murmured in surprise. &ldquo;Even an Aes
Sedai would have to go some to do that. Most tales of Darkhounds are just
people frightened by the dark.&rdquo; Frowning at the tracks crossing the smoothed
stone, he shook his head, and sadness entered his voice when he said, &ldquo;They
were wolves, once. The souls of wolves, anyway, caught and twisted by the
Shadow. That was the core used to make Darkhounds, the Shadowbrothers. I think
that&rsquo;s why the wolves have to be at the Last Battle. Or maybe Darkhounds were
made because wolves will be there, to fight them. The Pattern makes Sovarra
lace look like a piece of string, sometimes. Anyway, it was a long time ago,
during the Trolloc Wars as near as I can make out, and the War of the Shadow
before that. Wolves have long memories. What a wolf knows is never really
forgotten while other wolves remain alive. They avoid talking about Darkhounds,
though, and they avoid Darkhounds, too. A hundred wolves could die trying to
kill one Shadowbrother. Worse, if they fail, the Darkhound can eat the souls of
those that aren&rsquo;t quite dead yet, and in a year or so, there&rsquo;d be a new pack of
Shadowbrothers that didn&rsquo;t remember ever being wolves. I hope they don&rsquo;t
remember, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin reined in, though he itched to keep moving. Shadowbrothers. The
wolves&rsquo; name for Darkhounds had taken on a new grimness. &ldquo;Can they eat a man&rsquo;s
soul, Elyas? Say a man who can talk to wolves?&rdquo; Elyas shrugged. Only a handful
of people could do what they did, as far as either man knew. An answer to that
question might come only at the point of death. More importantly right then,
if they had been wolves, once, they must be intelligent enough to report what
they found. Masuri had implied as much. Foolishness to hope otherwise. How long
before they did? How long did he have to free Faile?</p>

<p>The sound of hooves crunching in snow announced riders coming, and he
hurriedly told Elyas that the Darkhounds had circled the camp, that they would
be carrying word of him to whomever they reported to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t worry overmuch, boy,&rdquo; the older man
replied, watching warily for sight of the oncoming horses. Moving away from the
stone, he began to stretch, working muscles over-long in the saddle. Elyas was
too careful to be caught studying what would be swallowed in shadows to other
eyes. &ldquo;Sounds like they&rsquo;re hunting something more important than you. They&rsquo;ll
stay on that till they find it if it takes all year. Don&rsquo;t worry. We&rsquo;ll get
your wife out before those Darkhounds report you were here. Not saying it&rsquo;ll be
easy, but we&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo; There was determination in his voice, and in his scent,
but not much hope. Almost none at all, in fact.</p>

<p>Fighting despair, refusing to let it rise again, Perrin resumed walking
Stepper as Berelain and her bodyguard appeared through the trees, with Marline
astride behind Annoura. As soon as the Aes Sedai drew rein, the twilight-eyed
Wise One slid to the ground, shaking down her thick skirts to cover her dark
stockings. Another woman might have appeared flustered over having her legs
exposed, but not Marline. She was merely straightening her clothes. Annoura was
the one who looked upset, a sour-faced disgruntlement that made her nose seem
more like a beak. She kept silent, but her mouth was set to bite. She must have
been certain her offer to negotiate with the Shaido would be accepted,
especially with Berelain supporting and Marline seemingly neutral at worst.
Grays were negotiators and mediators, adjudicators and treaty makers. That
might have been her motivation. What else could it have been? A problem that he
had to set aside while keeping it in mind. He had to take into account anything
that might interfere with freeing Faile, but the problem he had to solve lay
forty miles to the northeast.</p>

<p>While the Winged Guards formed their protective circle among the
towering trees around the Traveling ground, Berelain brought her bay alongside
Stepper and paced him, trying to engage Perrin in talk, to entice him with the
rest of the woodhen. She smelled uncertain, doubtful of his decision. Maybe she
hoped to talk him into attempting the ransom. He kept Stepper moving and
refused to listen. To make that attempt was to gamble everything on one toss
of the dice. He could not gamble with Faile as the stake. Methodical as working
at a forge, that was the way. Light, but he was tired. He folded himself in
tighter around his anger, embracing the heat for energy. Gallenne and Arganda
arrived shortly after Berelain, with a double column of Ghealdanin lancers in
burnished breastplates and bright conical helmets who interspersed themselves
among the Mayeners between the trees. A trace of irritation entering her scent,
Berelain left Perrin and rode to Gallenne. The pair of them sat their horses
knee-to-knee, the one-eyed man bending his head to listen to what Berelain had
to say. Her voice was low, but Perrin knew their subject, at least in part. Now
and then one of them glanced at him as he walked Stepper back and forth, back
and forth. Arganda planted his roan in one spot and stared south through the
trees toward the camp, still as a statue yet radiating impatience as a fire
radiated heat. He was the picture of a soldier, with his plumes and his sword
and his silvered armor, his face as hard as stone, but he smelled on the brink
of panic. Perrin wondered how he himself smelled. You could never catch your
own scent unless you were in a closed space. He did not think he smelled of
panic, just fear and anger. All would be well once he had Faile back. All would
be well, then. Back and forth, back and forth.</p>

<p>At last Aram appeared, with a yawning Jur Grady on a
dark bay gelding, dark enough that the white stripe on its nose made it seem
almost a black. Dannil and a dozen Two Rivers men, spears and halberds
abandoned for the moment in favor of their longbows, rode close behind, but
not too close. A stocky fellow with a weathered face already beginning to show
creases, though he was short of his middle years yet, Grady looked like a
sleepy farmer despite of the long-hilted sword at his waist and his black coat
with the silver sword pin on the high collar, but he had left the farm behind
forever, and Dannil and the others always gave him room. They gave Perrin room,
too, hanging back and peering at the ground, sometimes darting quick,
embarrassed looks at him or Berelain. It did not matter. All would be well.</p>

<p>Aram tried to lead Grady to Perrin, but the Asha&rsquo;man
knew why he had been summoned. With a sigh, he climbed down beside Elyas, who
squatted in a patch of sunlight to mark a map in the snow with his finger and
speak of distance and direction, describing the place he wanted to go in
detail, a clearing on a slope that faced almost south, with the ridge above
notched in three places. Distance and direction were enough,
if the distance and direction were precise, but the better the picture in an
Asha&rsquo;man&rsquo;s mind, the closer he could come to an exact spot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no
margin for error here, boy.&rdquo; Elyas&rsquo;s eyes seemed to brighten with intensity.
Whatever others thought of Asha&rsquo;man, they never intimidated him. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s lots
of ridges in that country, and the main camp is only a mile or so the other
side of this one. There&rsquo;ll be sentries, little parties that camp in a different
place every night, maybe less than two miles the other way. You put us out off
by much, and we&rsquo;ll be seen for sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grady met
that stare, unblinking. Then he nodded and scrubbed stubby ringers through his
hair, drawing a deep breath. He looked as weary as Elyas. As bone-tired as
Perrin felt. Making gateways, holding them open long enough for thousands of
people and horses to pass through, was wearing work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are
you rested enough?&rdquo; Perrin asked him. Tired men made mistakes, and mistakes
with the One Power could be deadly. &ldquo;Should I send for Neald?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grady
stared up at him blearily, then shook his head. &ldquo;Fager&rsquo;s no more rested than
me. Less, maybe. I&rsquo;m stronger than he is, a bit. Better if I do it.&rdquo; He turned
to face northeast, and with no more warning, a vertical slash of silver-blue
appeared beside the track-marked stone. Annoura jerked her mare out of the way
with a loud gasp as the line of light widened into an opening, a hole in the
air that showed a sunlit clearing on steep ground among trees much smaller than
those around Perrin and the others. The already splintered pine shivered as it
lost another thin slice, groaned, and collapsed the rest of the way with a
snow-muffled crash that made the horses snort and dance. Annoura glared at the
Asha&rsquo;man, her face growing dark, but Grady just blinked and said, &ldquo;Does that
look like the right place?&rdquo; Elyas adjusted his hat before nodding.</p>

<p>That
nod was all Perrin waited for. He ducked his head and rode Stepper through into
snow that was over the dun&rsquo;s fetlocks. It was a small clearing, but the sky
full of white clouds overhead made it seem vastly open after the forest behind.
The light was almost blinding compared to the forest, though the sun was still
hidden by the tree-covered ridge above. The Shaido camp lay on the other side
of that ridge. He stared toward the height yearningly. It was all he could do to stay where he was rather than race
ahead to finally see where Faile was. He made himself turn Stepper to face the
gateway as Marline came out.</p>

<p>Still studying him, hardly taking her eyes away long
enough to place her feet in the snow without tripping, she moved to one side to
let Aram and the Two Rivers men ride through. Accustomed to Traveling if not to
Asha&rsquo;man by now, they barely bent their heads enough to clear the top of the
opening, and only the tallest did even that. It struck Perrin that the gateway
was larger than the first one of Grady&rsquo;s make that he had passed through. He
had had to dismount, then. It was a vague thought, no more important than a fly
buzzing. Aram rode straight to Perrin, tight-faced and smelling impatient and
eager to be going on, and once Dannil and the others were out of the way,
climbing down and calmly fitting arrows to bows while they watched the
surrounding trees, Gallenne appeared, peering grimly at the trees around them
as though he expected an enemy to come dashing out, followed by half a dozen
Mayeners who had to lower their red-streamered lances to crowd through after
him.</p>

<p>A long pause passed with the gateway empty, but just
when Perrin had decided to go back and see what was holding Elyas up, the
bearded man led his horse out, with Arganda and six Ghealdanin riding at his
heels, discontent carved on their faces. Their shining helmets and breastplates
were nowhere to be seen, and they scowled as though they had been made to leave
off their breeches.</p>

<p>Perrin nodded to himself. Of course. The Shaido camp
was on the other side of this ridge, and so was the sun. That gleaming armor
would have been like mirrors. He should have thought of that. He was still
letting fear goad him into impatience and cloud his thinking. He had to be
clearheaded, now more than ever. The detail he missed now could kill him and
leave Faile in Shaido hands. It was easier to say that he had to let go of fear
than to do it, though. How could he not be afraid for Faile? It had to be managed,
but how?</p>

<p>To his surprise, Annoura rode through the gateway just
ahead of Grady, who was leading his dark bay. Just as every time he had seen
her pass through a gateway, she lay as flat on her mare as her saddle&rsquo;s high
pommel would allow, grimacing at the opening that had been made with the
tainted male half of the Power, and as soon as she was clear of it, she urged
her horse as far up the slope as she could without entering the trees. Grady
let the gateway snap shut, leaving the purple afterimage of a vertical bar in
Perrin&rsquo;s eyes, and Annoura flinched and looked away, glaring at Marline, at
Perrin. If she had been anyone other than an Aes Sedai, he would have said she
was simmering in a sullen fury. Berelain must have told her to come, but it was
not Berelain she blamed for her having to be there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From here, we go afoot,&rdquo; Elyas announced in a quiet
voice that barely carried over the occasional stamp of a horse&rsquo;s hoof. He had
said the Shaido were careless and had no sentries, or almost none, but he spoke
as if they could be within twenty paces. &ldquo;A man on a horse stands out. The
Shaido aren&rsquo;t blind, just blind for Aiel, which means they see twice as sharp
as any of you, so don&rsquo;t go skylining yourselves when we reach the crest. And
try not to make any more noise than you can help. They aren&rsquo;t deaf, either.
They&rsquo;ll find our tracks, eventually&mdash;can&rsquo;t do much about that in snow&mdash;but we
can&rsquo;t let them know we were here until after we&rsquo;re gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Already sour over being shorn of his armor and plumes,
Arganda began to argue about Elyas giving orders. Not being a complete fool, he
did it in a quiet voice that would not carry, but he had been a soldier since
the age of fifteen, he had commanded soldiers fighting Whitecloaks, Altarans
and Amadicians, and as he was fond of pointing out, he had fought in the Aiel
War and lived through the Blood Snow, at Tar Valon. He knew about Aiel, and he
did not need an unbarbered woodsman to tell him how to put his boots on. Perrin
let it pass, since the man did his complaining in between telling off two men
to hold the horses. He really was not a fool, just afraid for his queen.
Gallenne left all of his men behind, muttering that lancers were worse than
useless off their horses and would probably break their necks if he made them
walk any distance. He was no fool, either, but he did see the black side
first. Elyas took the lead, and Perrin waited only long enough to transfer the
thick brass-bound tube of his looking glass from Stepper&rsquo;s saddlebags to his
coat pocket before following.</p>

<p>The underbrush grew in clumps beneath the trees, which
were mostly pine and fir, with clusters of others that were winter-gray and
leafless, and the terrain, no steeper than the Sand Hills back home, if more
rocky, presented no problems for Dannil and the other Two Rivers men, who
ghosted up the slope with arrows nocked and eyes watchful, almost as silent as
the mist of their breath. Aram, no stranger to the woods himself, stayed close
to Perrin with his sword out. Once he started to chop a tangle of thick brown
vines out of his way until Perrin stopped him with a hand on his arm, yet he
made little more noise than Perrin, the faint crunch of boots in snow. It was
no shock that Marline moved through the trees as if she had grown up in a
forest instead of the Aiel Waste, where anything that could be called a tree
was rare and snow unheard of, though it seemed that all of her necklaces and
bracelets should have made some clatter as they swung, but Annoura climbed with
almost as little effort, floundering a little with her skirts but deftly
avoiding the sharp thorns of dead cat&rsquo;s-claw and wait-a-minute vines. Aes Sedai
usually found a way to surprise you. She managed to keep a wary eye on Grady, too,
though the Asha&rsquo;man appeared to be focused on putting one foot in front of the
other. Sometimes he sighed heavily and paused for a minute, frowning toward the
crest ahead, but somehow he never fell behind. Gallenne and Arganda were not
young men, nor accustomed to walking where they could ride, and their breathing
began to grow heavier as they ascended, sometimes pulling themselves up from
tree to tree, but they watched one another nearly as much as they did the
ground, each unwilling to let the other outdo him. The four Ghealdanin lancers,
on the other hand, slipped and slid, tripped over roots hidden beneath the
snow, caught their scabbards on vines, and growled curses when they fell on
rocks or were stabbed by thorns. Perrin began to consider sending them back to
wait with the horses. That, or hitting them over the head and leaving them to
be picked up when he returned.</p>

<p>Abruptly, two Aiel stepped out of the undergrowth in
front of Elyas, dark veils hiding their faces to the eyes, white cloaks hanging
down their backs and spears and bucklers in hand. They were Maidens of the
Spear by their height, which made them no less dangerous than any other <em>algai&rsquo;d&rsquo;siswai</em>,
and in an instant, nine longbows were drawn, broadhead points aimed at
their hearts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could get hurt that way, Tuandha,&rdquo; Elyas muttered. &ldquo;You should know
better, Sulin.&rdquo; Perrin motioned for the Two Rivers men to lower their bows, and
for Aram to lower his sword. He had caught their scents as soon as Elyas had,
before they stepped into the open.</p>

<p>The Maidens exchanged startled looks, but they unveiled, letting the
dark veils hang down their chests. &ldquo;You see closely, Elyas Machera,&rdquo; Sulin
said. Wiry and leather-faced, with a scar across one cheek, she had sharp blue
eyes that could pierce like awls, but they still looked surprised, now. Tuandha
was taller and younger, and she might have been pretty before losing her right
eye and gaining a thick scar than ran from her chin up under her <em>shoufa.</em> It
pulled up one corner of her mouth in a half-smile, but that was the only smile
she ever gave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your coats are different,&rdquo; Perrin said. Tuandha frowned down at her
coat, all gray and green and brown, then at Sulin&rsquo;s identical garment. &ldquo;Your
cloaks, too.&rdquo; Elyas <em>was</em> tired, to make that slip. &ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t started
moving, have they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Perrin Aybara,&rdquo; Sulin said. &ldquo;The Shaido seem prepared to stay in
one place for a time. They made the people from the city leave and go north
last night, those they would let leave.&rdquo; She gave a small shake of her head,
still perturbed by the Shaido forcing people to become <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> who did
not follow <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh.</em> &ldquo;Your friends Jondyn Barran and Get Ayliah and Hu
Marwin have gone after them to see if they can learn anything. Our
spear-sisters and Gaul are making their way around the camp again. We waited
here for Elyas Machera to return with you.&rdquo; She seldom let emotion into her
voice, and there was none there now, but she smelled of sadness. &ldquo;Come, I will
show you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two Maidens turned up the slope, and he hurried after them, forgetting
anyone else. A little short of the crest, they crouched, then went to hands and
knees, and he copied them, crawling the last spans through the snow to peer
past a tree over the top of the ridgeline. The forest ended there, fading into
scattered brush and isolated saplings on the downslope. He was high enough to
see for several leagues, across rolling ridges like long treeless hills to
where a dark band of forest began again. He could see everything he wanted to
see, and so much less than he needed.</p>

<p>He had tried to imagine the Shaido camp from Elyas&rsquo;
description, but the reality dwarfed his imaginings. A thousand paces below
lay a mass of low Aiel tents and every other sort of tent, a mass of wagons and
carts and people and horses. It spread for well over a mile in every direction
from the gray stone walls of a city halfway to the next rise. He knew the
sprawl must be the same on the other side. It was not one of the great cities,
not like Caemlyn or Tar Valon, less than four hundred paces wide along the side
he could see and narrower on the others, it seemed, but still a city with high
walls and towers and what looked like a fortress at the northmost end. Yet the
Shaido encampment swallowed it whole. Faile was somewhere in that great lake of
people.</p>

<p>Fumbling his looking glass from his pocket, he remembered at the last
instant to cup one hand for shade on the far end of the tube. The sun was a
golden ball almost ahead of him, just shy of halfway to its noonday height. A
stray reflection from the lens could ruin everything. Groups of people leapt up
in the looking glass, their faces clear, at least to his eye. Long-haired women
with dark shawls over their shoulders, draped in dozens of long necklaces,
women with fewer necklaces milking goats, women wearing the <em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em> and
sometimes carrying spears and bucklers, women peeking from the deep cowls of
heavy white robes as they scurried across snow already trampled halfway to mud.
There were men and children, too, but his eye skipped past them hungrily, ignored
them. Thousands upon thousands of women, just counting those in white.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too many,&rdquo; Marline whispered, and he lowered the glass to glare at her.
The others had joined the Maidens and him, all lying in a row in the snow along
the ridgeline. The Two Rivers men were taking pains to keep their bowstrings up
out of the snow without raising their bows above the ridgeline. Arganda and
Gallenne were using their own looking glasses to study the camp below, and
Grady was staring down the slope with his chin propped on his hands, every bit
as intent as the two soldiers. Maybe he was using the Power in some way.
Marline and Annoura were staring at the camp, too, the Aes Sedai licking her
lips and the Wise One frowning. Perrin did not think Marline had intended to
speak aloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you think I&rsquo;ll walk away just because there are more Shaido than I
expected,&rdquo; he began heatedly, but she broke in, meeting his scowl with a level
look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too many Wise Ones, Perrin Aybara. Wherever I look, I
can see a woman channeling. Just for a moment here, a moment there&mdash;Wise Ones
do not channel all the time&mdash;but they are everywhere I look. Too many to be
the Wise Ones of ten septs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew a deep breath. &ldquo;How many do you think there
are?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think maybe all the Shaido Wise Ones are down
there,&rdquo; Marline replied, as calm as if she were talking about the price of
barley. &ldquo;All who can channel.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>All</em> of them?
That made no sense! How could they all be together here, when the Shaido seemed
to be scattered everywhere? At least, he had heard tales of what had to be
Shaido raids all across Ghealdan and Amadicia, tales of raids here in Altara
long before Faile was taken and rumors from even farther. <em>Why</em> would they
all be together? If the Shaido intended to gather here, the whole clan&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;No, he had to deal with what he knew for fact. That was bad enough. &ldquo;How many?&rdquo;
he asked again, in a reasonable tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not growl at me, Perrin Aybara. I cannot say exactly how many Shaido
Wise Ones remain alive. Even Wise Ones die from sickness, snakebite, accident.
Some died at Dumai&rsquo;s Wells. We found bodies left behind, and they must have
carried away those they could for proper burial. Even Shaido cannot have
abandoned all custom. If all who remain alive are below, and the apprentices
who can channel, I would say perhaps four hundred. Perhaps more, but fewer than
five hundred. There were fewer than five hundred Shaido Wise Ones who could
channel before they crossed the Dragonwall, and perhaps fifty apprentices.&rdquo;
Most farmers would have shown more emotion over the barley.</p>

<p>Still staring at the Shaido camp, Annoura made a
strangled sound, half a sob. &ldquo;Five hundred? Light! Half the Tower from one
clan? Oh, Light!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We could sneak in, in the night,&rdquo; Dannil murmured from down the row,
&ldquo;the way you sneaked into that Whitecloak camp back home.&rdquo; Elyas gave a grunt
that might have meant anything but did not sound hopeful.</p>

<p>Sulin snorted derisively. &ldquo;<em>We</em> could not sneak into that camp, not
with any real hope of getting out. <em>You</em> would be trussed like a
goat for the spit before you passed the first tents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin nodded slowly. He had thought of slipping in under cover of
darkness and somehow spiriting Faile away. And the others, of course. She
would not go without the others. He had never had any real belief that could work,
though, not against Aiel, and the size of the camp had quenched the last
glimmers. He could wander for days among that many people without finding her.</p>

<p>Abruptly, he realized that he was not having to fight
down despair. The anger remained, but it was cold as steel in winter, now, and
he could not detect a single drop of the hopelessness that had threatened to
drown him before. There were ten thousand <em>algai&rsquo;d&rsquo;siswai</em> in that camp,
and five hundred women who could channel&mdash;Gallenne had the right of it; prepare
for the worst, and all your surprises were pleasant ones&mdash;five hundred women
who would not hesitate to use the Power as a weapon; Faile was hidden like one
snowflake in a meadow covered with snow, but when you piled up so much, there
just was no point in despair. You had to buckle down or be plowed under.
Besides, he could see the puzzle, now. Nat Torfinn had always said any puzzle
could be solved, once you found out where to push and where to pull.</p>

<p>To the north and south, the land had been cleared
farther from the city than the rise where he lay. Scattered farmhouses, none
with smoke rising from its chimney, dotted the landscape, and rail fences
marked out fields beneath the snow, but more than a handful of men trying to
approach from either direction might as well carry torches and banners and blow
trumpets. There seemed to be a road leading roughly south through the farms and
another roughly north. Useless to him, probably, but you never could tell.
Jondyn might bring back some information about the city, though what good that
would do when the city was in the middle of the Shaido, he could not begin to
guess. Gaul and the Maidens who were making their way around the camp would be
able to tell him what lay beyond the next ridge. A saddle in that ridge had the
look of a road heading somewhere east. Oddly, a cluster of windmills stood
maybe a mile north of the saddle, long white arms turning slowly, and there
appeared to another group of windmills atop the next rise beyond. A row of
arches, like a long narrow bridge, stretched down the
slope from the nearest windmills all the way to the city walls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does
anybody know what that is?&rdquo; he asked, pointing. Studying it through the
looking glass told him nothing except that it seemed made of the same
gray stone as the wall. The thing was much too narrow for a bridge. It lacked
side walls, and there did not seem to be anything for a bridge to cross.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It
is for bringing water,&rdquo; Sulin replied. &ldquo;It runs for five miles, to a lake. I do
not know why they did not build their city closer, but most of the land
around the lake looks as if it will be mud when the cold goes away.&rdquo; She
no longer stumbled over unfamiliar words like mud, yet a touch of awe remained
in &ldquo;lake,&rdquo; in the idea of so much water in one place. &ldquo;You think to stop their
water supply? That will surely make them come out.&rdquo; She understood fighting
over water. Most fighting in the Waste started with water. &ldquo;But I do not think&mdash;&ldquo;</p>

<p>The
colors erupted inside Perrin&rsquo;s head, an explosion of hues so strong that sight
and hearing vanished. All sight except for the colors themselves, at least.
They were a vast tide, as if all the times he had pushed them out of his head
had built a dam that they now smashed aside in a silent flood, swirling in
soundless whirlpools that tried to suck him under. An image coalesced in the
middle of it, Rand and Nynaeve sitting on the ground facing one another, as
clear as if they were right in front of him. He had no time for Rand, not now.
Not now! Clawing at the colors like a drowning man clawing for the surface, he&mdash;forced&mdash;them&mdash;out!</p>

<p>Sight
and hearing, the world around, crashed in on him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;it&rsquo;s madness,&rdquo; Grady was saying in worried tones. &ldquo;Nobody can handle enough
of <em>saidin</em> for me to feel that far off! Nobody!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No
one can handle that much of <em>saidar</em>, either,&rdquo; Marline murmured. &ldquo;But
someone is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The
Forsaken?&rdquo; Annoura&rsquo;s voice shook. &ldquo;The Forsaken, using some <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em> we
never suspected. Or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;or the Dark One himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were
all three peering back to the north and west, and if Marline looked calmer than
Annoura or Grady, she smelled as frightened and worried. Except for Elyas, the
others were watching those three with the look of men awaiting an
announcement that a new Breaking of the World had begun. Elyas&rsquo;s face was
accepting. A wolf would snap at a landslide carrying him to his death, but a
wolf knew that death came sooner or later, and you could not fight death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Rand,&rdquo; Perrin muttered thickly. He shuddered as
the colors tried to return, but he hammered them down. &ldquo;His business. He&rsquo;ll
take care of it, whatever it is.&rdquo; Everyone was staring at him, even Elyas. &ldquo;I
need prisoners, Sulin. They must send out hunting parties. Elyas says they have
sentries out a few miles, small groups. Can you get me prisoners?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen to me carefully,&rdquo; Annoura said, the words rushing out of her.
She rose up out of the snow enough to reach over Marline and seize a fistful of
Perrin&rsquo;s cloak. &ldquo;Something is happening, perhaps wonderful, perhaps terrible,
but in any case momentous, more so than anything in recorded history! We must
know what! Grady can take us there, close enough to see. <em>I</em> could take us
if I knew the weaves. We must know!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meeting her gaze, Perrin raised his hand, and she stopped with her mouth
open. Aes Sedai never shut up that easily, yet she did. &ldquo;I told you what it is.
Our work is right down there in front of us. Sulin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sulin&rsquo;s head swung from him to the Aes Sedai to Marline. Finally, she
shrugged. &ldquo;You will learn little useful even if you put them to the question.
They will embrace the pain and laugh at you. And shame will be slow&mdash;if these
Shaido can still be shamed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever I learn will be more than I know now,&rdquo; he
replied. His work lay in front of him. A puzzle to solve, Faile to free, and
the Shaido to destroy. That was all that mattered in the world.</p>
