<h4><em>Two Captains</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">A</span>bout two
 miles north of the city a wide blue banner stretched between two tall poles
 rippled in the wind, proclaiming Valan Luca&rsquo;s Grand Traveling Show and Magnificent
 Display of Marvels and Wonders in brilliant red letters large enough to be
 read from the road, perhaps a hundred paces east. For those unable to read,
 it at least indicated the location of something out of the ordinary. This was
 The Largest Traveling Show in the World, so the banner claimed. Luca claimed
 a great many things, but Mat thought he must be telling the truth about that.
 The show&rsquo;s canvas wall, ten feet high and tightly pegged at the bottom,
 enclosed as much ground as a good-sized village.</p>

<p>The people
streaming by looked toward the banner curiously, but the farmers and merchants
had their work ahead of them and the settlers their future, and none turned
aside. Thick ropes fastened to posts set in the ground were meant to herd
crowds to the wide, arched entrance just behind the banner, but there was no
one waiting to get in, not at this hour. Of late, few came at any hour. The
fall of Ebou Dar had brought only a slight drop in attendance, once people
realized the city would not be looted and they did not have to flee for their lives, but with the Return, all those ships and
settlers, nearly everyone decided to hold on to their coin against more
pressing needs. Two bulky men, huddling in cloaks that might have come from a
ragbag, were on duty beneath the banner to keep out anyone who wanted to peek
around without paying, but even those were in short supply, nowadays. The pair,
one with a crooked nose above a thick mustache and the other missing an eye,
were squatting on the dirt, tossing dice.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, Petra Anhill, the show&rsquo;s strongman,
stood watching the two horse-handlers play, arms larger than most men&rsquo;s legs
folded across his chest. He was shorter than Mat, but at least twice as wide,
his shoulders straining the heavy blue coat his wife made him wear against the
cold. Petra seemed engrossed in the dicing, but the man did not gamble, not so
much as pitching pennies. He and his wife, Clarine, a dog trainer, saved every
coin they could spare, and Petra needed small excuse to talk at length about
the inn they intended to buy one day. Even more surprising, Clarine was at his
side, enveloped in a dark cloak and apparently as absorbed in the gaming as he.</p>

<p>Petra glanced warily over his shoulder into the camp
when he saw Mat and Egeanin approaching arm-in-arm, which made Mat frown.
People looking over their shoulders was never good. Clarine&rsquo;s plump brown face
broke into a warm smile, though. Like most women in the show, she thought he
and Egeanin were romantic. The bent-nosed horse-handler, a heavy-shouldered
Tairen named Col, leered as he scooped up the wager, a few coppers. No one but
Domon could see Egeanin as pretty, but to some fools, nobility bestowed beauty.
Or money did, and a noblewoman must be rich. A few thought any noblewoman who
abandoned her husband for the likes of Mat Cauthon might be open to leaving
him, too, and bringing her money with her. That was the story Mat and the
others had put around to explain why they were hiding from the Seanchan: a
cruel husband and a lovers&rsquo; flight. Everyone had heard that sort of tale, from
gleemen or books if seldom real life, often enough to accept it. Col kept his
head down, though. Egeanin&mdash;Leilwin&mdash;had already drawn her belt knife on a
sword-juggler, a too-handsome fellow who had been overly suggestive in asking
her to share a cup of wine in his wagon, and no one doubted she would have used
the blade if he had pressed his suit an inch further.</p>

<p>As soon as Mat reached the strongman, Petra said
quietly, &ldquo;There are Seanchan soldiers talking to Luca, about twenty of them.
The officer&rsquo;s talking with him, leastwise.&rdquo; He did not sound frightened, but
worry creased his forehead, and he laid a protective hand on his wife&rsquo;s
shoulder. Clarine&rsquo;s smile faded, and she raised one hand to rest atop his. They
trusted Luca&rsquo;s judgment, after a fashion, yet they knew the risk they were
running. Or thought they did. The risk they believed in was bad enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do they want?&rdquo; Egeanin demanded, pushing free of
Mat, before he could crack his teeth. In fact, no one waited for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold these for me,&rdquo; Noal said, handing his pole and
basket to the one-eyed man, who gaped up at him. Straightening, Noal slipped a
knobbly hand beneath his coat, where he kept two long-bladed knives. &ldquo;Can we
reach our horses?&rdquo; he asked Petra. The strongman eyed him doubtfully. Mat was
not the only one unsure whether Noal still possessed all his wits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t seem interested in searching,&rdquo; Clarine
said hastily, making a hint of a curtsy to Egeanin. Everyone was supposed to
pretend Mat and the others were part of the show, but few managed to carry it
off with Egeanin. &ldquo;The officer&rsquo;s been in Luca&rsquo;s wagon for a good half-hour, but
the soldiers have been standing by their horses all that time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re here about you,&rdquo; Petra added
respectfully. Again, to Egeanin. Why should he be different? Probably practicing
to welcome nobles to that inn. &ldquo;We just didn&rsquo;t want you to be surprised or
worried, seeing them. I&rsquo;m sure Luca will send them off with no trouble.&rdquo;
Despite his tone, the creases remained in his forehead. Most men became upset
if their wives ran off, and a nobleman could make others bear the brunt of his
ire. A traveling show, strangers just passing through, made a particularly easy
target without added complications. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to worry about anybody
talking out of turn, my Lady.&rdquo; Glancing at the horse handlers, Petra added,
&ldquo;Does she, Col?&rdquo; Bentnose shook his head, his eyes on the dice he was bouncing
on his palm. He was a big man, but not as big as Petra, and the strongman could
straighten horseshoes with his bare hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everybody likes a chance to spit on a noble&rsquo;s boots
now and then,&rdquo; the one-eyed fellow mumbled, peering into the basket of fish. He
was almost as tall and wide-shouldered as Col, but his face was all leathery
wrinkles, and he had even fewer teeth than Noal. Glancing at Egeanin, he ducked
his head and added, &ldquo;Begging your pardon, Lady. &rsquo;Sides, this way we all get a
little coin, which there ain&rsquo;t been much of lately. Right, Col? Anybody talks,
them Seanchan&rsquo;ll take us all up, maybe hang us like they did them Sea Folk. Or
put us to work cleaning them canals the other side of the harbor.&rdquo; Horse
handlers did whatever needed doing around the show, from mucking the horselines
and cleaning animals&rsquo; cages to erecting and taking down the canvas wall, but he
shuddered as though digging out silted canals in the Rahad was a worse prospect
than hanging.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I say anything about talking?&rdquo; Col protested,
spreading his hands. &ldquo;I just asked how long we&rsquo;re going to sit here, that&rsquo;s
all. I just asked when we&rsquo;re going to see some of this coin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We sit here as long as I say sit.&rdquo; It was remarkable how hard Egeanin
could make that drawl sound without raising her voice, like a blade sliding
free of the scabbard. &ldquo;You see your coin when we reach our destination. There
will be a little something extra for those who serve me faithfully. And a cold
grave for anyone who thinks on betrayal.&rdquo; Col pulled his much-patched cloak
tight and widened his eyes trying to look indignant, or maybe innocent, but he
just appeared to be hoping she would come close enough for him to filch her
purse.</p>

<p>Mat ground his teeth. For one thing, that was his gold
she was promising with such a free hand. She had her own, but not near enough
for this. More importantly, she was trying to take charge again. Light, except
for him, she would still be in Ebou Dar scheming to avoid the Seekers, if not
already being put to the question. Except for him, she would never have
thought of staying close to Ebou Dar to throw off pursuit, or found a hiding
place with Luca&rsquo;s show. But why were soldiers there? The Seanchan would have
sent a hundred men, a thousand, for a vague suspicion of Tuon&rsquo;s presence. If they suspected the Aes Sedai&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;No; Petra and Clarine did not know they were helping hide Aes Sedai, but they
would have mentioned <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> and <em>damane</em>, and the soldiers would
not be hunting sisters without them. He fingered the foxhead through his coat.
He wore that waking and sleeping, and it might give him a little warning.</p>

<p>He never considered trying for the horses, and not just because Col and
a dozen more like him would go running to the Seanchan before he was well out
of sight. They had no particular animosity toward him or Egeanin that he knew&mdash;even Rumann, the sword-juggler, seemed to have settled in happily with a
contortionist named Adria&mdash;but some folks would not resist the temptation of a
little more gold, either. In any case, no warning dice tumbled in his head. And
there were people inside those canvas walls he could not leave behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;re not searching, then we have nothing to
worry about,&rdquo; he said confidently. &ldquo;But thanks for the warning, Petra. I&rsquo;ve
never liked surprises.&rdquo; The strongman made a small gesture as if to say it was
nothing, but Egeanin and Clarine looked at Mat as though startled to find him
there. Even Col and the one-eyed lout blinked at him. It took an effort to stop
short of gritting his teeth again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just wander near Luca&rsquo;s wagon and see
what I can see. Leilwin, you and Noal find Olver and stay with him.&rdquo; They liked
the boy, everyone did, and that would keep them out of his hair. He could
eavesdrop better alone. And if they had to run, maybe Egeanin and Noal could
help get the boy out, at least. The Light send it did not come to that. He
could see nothing but disaster in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose nobody lives forever,&rdquo; Noal sighed, retrieving his
bamboo pole and basket. Burn him, but the fellow could make a colicky goat seem
cheerful! Petra&rsquo;s frown certainly deepened. Married men always seemed to be worried,
one reason Mat was in no hurry himself. As Noal vanished around the corner of
the canvas wall, the one-eyed man watched the fish go regretfully. He appeared
to be another without a full set of wits. He probably had a wife somewhere.</p>

<p>Mat pulled his cap almost down to his eyes. Still no dice. He tried not
to think of how many times he had nearly had his throat slit or his skull split without any dice. But surely
they would have been there if there was any real danger. Of course they would.</p>

<p>He had not taken three steps inside the entrance
before Egeanin caught up to him and slipped her arm around his waist. He
stopped in his tracks, eyeing her balefully. She resisted his orders the way a
trout fought the hook, but this went beyond stubborn. &ldquo;What do you think
you&rsquo;re doing? What if this Seanchan officer recognizes you?&rdquo; That seemed as
likely as Tylin herself walking into the show, but anything that might make her
leave was worth grabbing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are the chances this fellow is anyone I know?&rdquo; she scoffed. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t have&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; her face twisted for an instant, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t have&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;many
friends this side of the ocean, and none in Ebou Dar.&rdquo; She touched an end of
the black wig over her bosom. &ldquo;Anyway, in this, my own mother wouldn&rsquo;t
recognize me.&rdquo; Her voice turned bleak toward the end.</p>

<p>He was going to chip a tooth if he kept on clenching his jaw. Standing
there arguing with her would be worse than useless, but the way she had stared
at those Seanchan soldiers was fresh in his mind. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t glare at anybody,&rdquo; he
warned her. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even look at anybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a demure Ebou Dari woman.&rdquo; She made it sound a challenge. &ldquo;You can
do all the talking.&rdquo; She made that into a warning. Light! When a woman was not
making everything smooth, she made things very rough indeed, and Egeanin never
made anything smooth. He was definitely in danger of chipping a tooth.</p>

<p>Beyond the entrance, the show&rsquo;s main street meandered
among wagons like those the Tinkers used, little houses on wheels with the
wagon shafts lifted against the drivers&rsquo; seats, and walled tents often as large
as small houses. Most of the wagons were brightly painted, every shade of red
or green, yellow or blue, and many of the tents were just as colorful, a few
even striped. Here and there wooden platforms, where entertainers could
perform, stood beside the street, their colored bunting beginning to look a bit
grubby. The broad expanse of dirt, near thirty paces wide and beaten flat by
thousands of feet, really was a street, one of several that wound through the
show. The wind whipped away faint gray streamers of smoke rising from the tin
chimneys that stuck from up from the roofs of the wagons, and from some tents.
Most of the showfolk were probably at breakfast if not still in bed. They rose
late, as a rule&mdash;a rule Mat approved&mdash;and no one would want to eat sitting
around a cook fire outside in this cold. The only person he saw was Aludra, the
sleeves of her dark green dress pushed up her forearms, grinding something with
a bronze mortar and pestle on a table that folded down from the side of her
vivid blue wagon, just around the corner on one of the narrower side streets.</p>

<p>Intent on her work, the slender Taraboner did not see Egeanin and Mat.
He could not help looking at her, though. With her dark hair in thin, beaded
braids that hung to her waist, Aludra was probably the most exotic of Luca&rsquo;s
marvels. He advertised her as an Illuminator, and unlike many of the other
performers and marvels, she really was what Luca claimed, though Luca probably
did not believe it himself. Mat wondered what she was grinding. And whether it
might explode. She had promised to reveal the secret of fireworks if he could
answer a riddle, but he had not found a glimmer, so far. He would, though. One
way or another.</p>

<p>Egeanin poked a hard finger into his ribs. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
supposed to be lovers, as you keep reminding me,&rdquo; she growled. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going to
believe it if you stare at that woman as though you&rsquo;re hungry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat grinned lasciviously. &ldquo;I always look at pretty
women, haven&rsquo;t you noticed&mdash;&rdquo; Adjusting her head scarf with a little more
vigor than usual, she gave a disparaging grunt, and he was satisfied. Her
prudish streak came in handy now and then. Egeanin was on the run for her life,
but she was still Seanchan, and she already knew more about him than he liked.
He was not about to trust her with all of his secrets. Even the ones he did not
know yet.</p>

<p>Luca&rsquo;s wagon sat in the very middle of the show&rsquo;s
camp, the most favored position, as far as possible from the smells of the animal
cages and horselines situated along the canvas walls. The wagon was garish even
compared to the others in the show, a red-and-blue thing that shone like the
finest lacquerwork, every surface spotted with golden comets and stars. The
phases of the moon, in silver, ran all the way around just below the roofline.
Even the tin chimney was painted in red and blue rings. A Tinker would have
blushed. To one side of the wagon two ranks of helmeted Seanchan soldiers stood
stiffly beside their horses, green-tasseled lances slanted at exactly the same
angle. One of the men held the reins of an extra mount, a fine dun gelding with
strong haunches and good ankles. The soldiers&rsquo; blue-and-green armor appeared
drab alongside Luca&rsquo;s wagon.</p>

<p>Mat was unsurprised to see he was not the only one
interested in the Seanchan. A dark stocking cap covering his shaved head, Bayle
Domon was squatting on his heels with his back against one wheel of the green
wagon that belonged to Petra and Clarine, about thirty paces beyond the
soldiers. Clarine&rsquo;s dogs lay under the wagon, a motley collection of smallish
animals sleeping huddled together. The thick-bodied Illianer was pretending to
whittle, but all he had produced was a small pile of shavings at his feet. Mat
wished the fellow would grow a mustache to hide his upper lip or else shave off
the rest of his beard. Someone might connect an Illianer to Egeanin. Blaeric
Negina, a tall fellow leaning against the wagon as though keeping Domon
company, had not hesitated to remove his Shienaran topknot to avoid Seanchan notice,
though he ran a hand over the black bristle growing on his head about as often
as Egeanin checked her wig. Maybe he should wear a cap.</p>

<p>In their dark coats with frayed cuffs and well-traveled boots, both men
could pass for showfolk, maybe horse-handlers, except to other showfolk. They
were watching the Seanchan while trying to seem not to, but Blaeric was the
more successful, as might be expected from a Warder. His full attention
appeared to be on Domon, except for an occasional glance at the soldiers, as
casual as could be. Domon scowled at the Seanchan when he was not glaring at
the lump of wood in his hand, as though ordering it to turn into a neat
carving. The man had taken being <em>so&rsquo;jhin</em> entirely too much to heart.</p>

<p>Mat was trying to figure out how to sneak close to
Luca&rsquo;s wagon and eavesdrop unseen by the soldiers when the door at the back of
the wagon opened and a pale-haired Seanchan marched down the steps, planting a
helmet with a thin blue plume on his head as his boot touched the ground. Luca
appeared behind him, resplendent in scarlet embroidered with golden sunbursts,
bowing with elaborate flourishes as he followed the officer. Luca owned at
least two dozen coats, most red and each gaudier than the last. It was a good
thing his wagon was the largest in the show, or he would not have had room for
them all.</p>

<p>Ignoring Luca, the Seanchan officer stepped up onto his gelding,
adjusted his sword, and barked orders that sent his men flowing into their
saddles and forming a column of twos that moved off at a slow walk toward the
entrance. Luca stood watching them leave with a fixed smile on his face, poised
for another bow if any looked back.</p>

<p>Mat stayed well to the side of the street and let his mouth hang open,
affecting to gape in wonder as the soldiers rode by. Not that any of them so
much as glanced his way&mdash;the officer stared straight ahead and so did the
soldiers behind him&mdash;but no one ever paid any mind to a country yokel, or
remembered one.</p>

<p>To his surprise, Egeanin studied the ground in front of her toes,
clutching the scarf knotted beneath her chin, until the last horseman passed.
Lifting her head to look after them, she pursed her lips for a moment. &ldquo;It
seems I do know that boy,&rdquo; she drawled softly. &ldquo;I carried him to Falme on <em>Fearless.</em>
His servant died, mid-voyage, and he thought he could use one of my crew. I
had to put him straight. You&rsquo;d have though he was of the Blood, the fuss he put
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blood and bloody ashes,&rdquo; Mat breathed. How many other people had she
gotten crosswise, fixing her face in their minds? Egeanin being Egeanin,
probably hundreds. And he had been letting her walk around with just a wig and
a change of clothes for disguise! Hundreds? Thousands, more likely. She could
irritate a brick.</p>

<p>In any case, the officer was gone now. Mat exhaled
slowly. His luck really was still with him. At times he thought that was all
that kept him from bawling like a baby. He headed for Luca to find out what the
soldiers had wanted.</p>

<p>Domon and Blaeric reached Luca as quickly as he and Egeanin did, and the
scowl on Domon&rsquo;s round face deepened as he stared at Mat&rsquo;s arm around Egeanin&rsquo;s
shoulder. The Illianer understood the necessity for the pretense, or said he
did, yet he seemed to believe they could carry it off without so much as
touching hands. Mat removed his arm from her&mdash;there was nothing to carry off
here; Luca knew the truth; of everything&mdash;and Egeanin started to release him,
too, yet after a look at Domon, she tightened her grip on Mat&rsquo;s waist instead,
all without the slightest change of expression. Domon continued to scowl, but
at the ground, now. Mat decided he would understand the Seanchan long before he
understood women. Or Illianers, for that matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Horses,&rdquo; Luca growled almost before Mat stopped
walking. His frown took in all of them, but he focused most of his anger on
Mat. A little the taller, Luca stretched to stare down at Mat. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he
wanted. I showed him the warrant exempting me from the horse lottery, signed by
the High Lady Suroth herself, but was he impressed? It didn&rsquo;t matter to him
that I rescued a high-ranking Seanchan.&rdquo; The woman had not been high-ranking,
and he had not so much rescued her as given her a way to travel as a hired
performer, but Luca always exaggerated to his own advantage. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how
long that exemption is really good for, anyway. The Seanchan are desperate for
horses. They might take it back any day!&rdquo; His face was turning almost as red as
his coat, and he jabbed a finger at Mat repeatedly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to get my
horses taken! How do I move my show with no horses? Answer me that, if you can.
I was ready to leave as soon as I saw that madness in the harbor, until you
twisted my arm. You&rsquo;re going to get my head cut off! I could be a hundred miles
from here, if not for you, riding in out of the night and snaring me in your
crazy schemes! I&rsquo;m not earning a penny here! There haven&rsquo;t been enough patrons
the last three days to pay for feeding the animals one day! Half a day! I
should have left a month ago! More! I should have!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat almost laughed as Luca ran down into splutters. Horses. That was
all; just horses. Besides, the notion that the show&rsquo;s heavy-laden wagons could
cover a hundred miles in five days was as ludicrous as Luca&rsquo;s wagon. The man
could have gone a month ago, two months, except for wanting to eke every copper
he could out of Ebou Dar and its Seanchan conquerors. And as for talking him
into staying, six nights past, that had been as easy as falling out of bed.</p>

<p>Instead of laughing, Mat put a hand on Luca&rsquo;s shoulder. The fellow was
vain as a peacock, and greedy besides, but there was no point making him
angrier than he already was. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d left that night, Luca, you think nobody
would have gotten suspicious? You would have had Seanchan tearing your wagons
apart before you made two leagues. You could say I saved you from that.&rdquo; Luca
glowered. Some people just could not see beyond their own noses. &ldquo;Anyway, you
can stop worrying. As soon as Thom returns from the city, we can put as many
miles behind us as you want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Luca leaped so suddenly that Mat stepped back in
alarm, but all the man did was caper in a little circle laughing. Domon goggled
at him, and even Blaeric stared. Sometimes, Luca seemed a flat bull-goose fool.</p>

<p>Luca had barely begun his dance when Egeanin shoved Mat away from her.
&ldquo;As soon as Merrilin returns? I gave orders no one was to leave!&rdquo; Her glare
swung between him and Luca in cold fury, a cold that burned. &ldquo;I expect my
orders to be obeyed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Luca stopped cavorting abruptly and eyed her sideways, then suddenly
made her a bow with so many flourishes you could practically see the cloak.
You could almost see the <em>embroidery</em> on the cloak! He thought he had a
way with a women, Luca did. &ldquo;You command, my sweet Lady, and I leap to obey.&rdquo;
Coming upright, he shrugged apologetically. &ldquo;But Master Cauthon has gold, and I
fear gold commands my first obedience.&rdquo; Mat&rsquo;s chest full of gold coins in this
very wagon had been all the arm-twisting needed to convince him. Maybe Mat
being <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> had helped, but for enough gold, Valan Luca would help
kidnap the Dark One.</p>

<p>Egeanin drew a deep breath, ready to berate Luca further, but the man
turned his back and went scampering up the steps into his wagon shouting,
&ldquo;Latelle! Latelle! We must roust everybody out immediately! We&rsquo;re leaving at
last, the minute Merrilin returns! The Light be praised!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A moment later, he was back again, dashing back down the short stair
followed by his wife drawing a black velvet cloak, sewn with glittering
spangles, around herself. A stern-faced woman, she wrinkled her nose at Mat as
though he had a bad smell and gave Egeanin a look that likely made her trained
bears climb trees. Latelle disliked the idea of a woman running away from her
husband even when she knew it was a lie. Luckily, she seemed to worship Luca
for some reason, and she liked gold nearly as well as he did. Luca ran to the
nearest wagon and began pounding on the door, and Latelle did the same at the
next.</p>

<p>Not waiting around to watch, Mat hurried off down one of the side
streets. More of an alley compared to the main street, it wound among the same
sort of wagons and tents, all shut up tight against the cold, with smoke
streaming from the metal chimneys. There were no platforms for performers here,
but lines for drying laundry hung between some of the wagons, and here and
there wooden toys lay scattered on the ground. This street was for living only,
the narrowness meant to discourage outsiders.</p>

<p>He moved
quickly despite his hip&mdash;he had walked most of the ache out&mdash;but he had not
gone ten steps before Egeanin and Domon caught up to him. Blaeric had vanished,
probably gone to tell the sisters they were still safe and could finally leave.
The Aes Sedai, masquerading as servants sick with worry that their mistress&rsquo;s
husband would catch them, were fed up with being confined to their wagon, not
to mention fed up with sharing with the <em>sul&rsquo;dam.</em> Mat had made them
share, so the Aes Sedai could watch the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> while the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> kept
the Aes Sedai out of his hair. Still Mat was glad Blaeric had taken away the
necessity for him to visit that wagon again. One or another of the sisters had
summoned him four or five times a day since their escape from the city, and he
went when he could not avoid it, but it was never a pleasant experience.</p>

<p>Egeanin did
not put her arm around him this time. She strode at his side staring straight
ahead, not bothering to check her wig, for once. Domon lumbered behind like a
bear, muttering under his breath in his heavy Illianer accent. The stocking cap
exposed the fact that his dark beard stopped abruptly at the middle of each
ear, with only stubble above. It made him look&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;unfinished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two
captains on one ship make sure course for disaster,&rdquo; Egeanin drawled with
overdone patience. Her understanding smile looked as if it hurt her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We
aren&rsquo;t on a ship,&rdquo; Mat replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The
principle&rsquo;s the same, Cauthon! You are a farmer. I know you&rsquo;re a good man in a
tight spot.&rdquo; Egeanin shot a dark look over her shoulder at Domon. He was the
one who had brought her and Mat together, back when she thought she was getting
a hired man. &ldquo;But this situation needs judgment and experience. We&rsquo;re in dangerous
waters, and you have no knowledge of command.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More
than you might think,&rdquo; he told her dryly. He could have spun out a list of the
battles he remembered commanding, but only
an historian would recognize most of them, and maybe not even an historian. No
one would believe it, anyway. He certainly would not if someone else had made
that claim. &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t you and Domon be getting ready? You wouldn&rsquo;t want to leave
anything behind.&rdquo; Everything she owned was already stowed away in the wagon she
and Mat shared with Domon&mdash;not a comfortable arrangement, that&mdash;but he
quickened his step, hoping she would take the hint. Besides, he saw his
destination ahead.</p>

<p>The bright blue wall-tent, crowded between a virulent
yellow wagon and an emerald green one, was barely large enough to hold three
cots, but providing shelter for everyone he brought out of Ebou Dar had
required bribes to make people move and more bribes to make others let them in.
What he had been able to hire was what the owners were willing to let him have.
At rates suitable for a good inn. Juilin, a dark compact man with short black
hair, was sitting cross-legged on the ground in front of the tent with Olver, a
thin little boy, if not so skinny as when Mat first saw him, and short for ten,
the age he claimed. Both coatless despite the wind, they were playing Snakes
and Foxes on a board the boy&rsquo;s dead father had drawn for him on a piece of red
cloth. Tossing the dice, Olver counted the pips carefully and considered his
move along the spiderweb of black lines and arrows. The Tairen thief-catcher
was paying less attention to the game. He sat up straight at the sight of Mat.</p>

<p>Abruptly, Noal darted around from the rear of the tent, breathing hard
as if he had been running. Juilin glanced up in surprise at the old man, and
Mat frowned. He had told Noal to come straight here. Where had he gone instead?
Noal looked at him expectantly, not with any guilt or embarrassment, just eager
to hear what Mat had to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know about the Seanchan?&rdquo; Juilin asked, turning
his attention to Mat, too.</p>

<p>A shadow moved inside the tent&rsquo;s entry flaps, and a
dark-haired woman, seated on the end of one of the cots with an old gray cloak
wrapped around her, leaned forward to rest a hand on Juilin&rsquo;s arm. And to give
Mat a wary look. Thera was pretty, if you liked a mouth that always seemed to
be pouting, and it seemed that Juilin did, from the way he smiled at her
reassuringly and patted her hand. She was also Amathera Aelfdene Casmir
Lounault, Panarch of Tarabon and the next thing to a queen. At least, she had
been, once. Juilin had known that, and so had Thom, yet no one thought to tell
Mat until they reached the show. He supposed it hardly mattered, alongside
everything else. She answered faster to Thera than to Amathera, she made no
demands, except on Juilin&rsquo;s time, and there seemed little chance anyone would
recognize her here. In any case, Mat hoped she felt more than gratitude for
being rescued, because Juilin certainly felt more for her. Who was to say a
dethroned panarch could not fall in love with a thief-catcher? Stranger things
had happened. Though he was not sure he could name one, offhand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They just wanted to see the warrant for Luca&rsquo;s
horses,&rdquo; he said, and Juilin nodded, visibly relaxing a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As well they didn&rsquo;t count the horselines.&rdquo; The
warrant listed the exact number of horses Luca was allowed to keep. The
Seanchan could be generous with their rewards, but given their need for mounts
and wagon teams, they were not about to hand anyone a license to set up horse
trading. &ldquo;At best, they would have taken the extra. At worst&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; The
thief-catcher shrugged. Another cheerful soul.</p>

<p>With a gasp, Thera suddenly pulled her cloak tighter and jerked back
into the depths of the tent. Juilin looked behind Mat, his eyes going hard, and
the Tairen could match the Warders when it came to hard. Egeanin did not seem
to catch hints, and she was glaring at the tent. Domon stood beside her with
his arms folded, sucking his teeth in thought or forced patience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get your tent packed up, Sandar,&rdquo; Egeanin ordered.
&ldquo;The show is leaving as soon as Merrilin returns.&rdquo; Her jaw tightened, and she
did not quite glare at Mat. Not quite. &ldquo;Make sure your&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;woman&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t give any trouble.&rdquo; Most lately, Thera had been a servant, <em>da&rsquo;covale</em>,
the property of the High Lady Suroth, until Juilin stole her away. To
Egeanin, stealing <em>da&rsquo;covale</em> was almost as bad as freeing <em>damane.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I ride Wind?&rdquo; Olver exclaimed, bounding to his feet. &ldquo;Can I, Mat?
Can I, Leilwin?&rdquo; Egeanin actually smiled at him. Mat had yet to see her smile
at anyone else, even Domon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; Mat said. Not until they were far enough
from Ebou Dar that no one was likely to remember the gray winning races with a
small boy on his back. &ldquo;In a few days, maybe. Juilin, will you tell the others?
Blaeric already knows, so the sisters are taken care of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Juilin did not waste time, aside from ducking inside
the tent to reassure Thera. She seemed to need reassuring frequently. When he
came out, carrying a dark Tairen coat that was beginning to show wear, he told
Olver to put the game away and help Thera with the packing until he returned,
then settled his flat-topped conical red hat on his head and started off,
shrugging into the coat. He never so much as glanced at Egeanin. She considered
him a thief, offensive in itself to a thief-catcher, and the Tairen had no love
for her, either.</p>

<p>Mat started to ask Noal where he had been, but the old
man darted nimbly after Juilin, calling over his shoulder that he would help
let the others know the show was leaving. Well, two could spread the word
faster than one&mdash;Vanin and the four surviving Redarms shared a crowded tent on
one side of the show, while Noal himself shared another with Thom and the two
serving men, Lopin and Nerim, on the opposite side&mdash;and the question could
wait. Probably, he had just delayed to put his precious fish somewhere safe. In
any case, the question suddenly seemed unimportant.</p>

<p>The noise of people shouting for horse handlers to bring their teams,
and others demanding at the top of their lungs to know what was happening, was
beginning to fill the camp. Adria, a slim woman holding a flowered green robe
around her, came running up in bare feet and vanished into the yellow wagon,
where the other four contortionists lived. Somebody in the green wagon bellowed
hoarsely that people were trying to sleep. A handful of performers&rsquo; children,
some performers themselves, dashed by, and Olver looked up from folding the
game. That was his most prized possession, but if not for that, he plainly
would have gone after them. It was going to take some time yet before the show
was ready to travel, but that was not what made Mat groan. He had just heard those
bloody dice start rattling in his head again.</p>
