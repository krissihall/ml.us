<h4><em>A Fan of Colors</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">M</span>at did not
 know whether to curse or weep. With the soldiers gone and Ebou Dar about to
 be left in his dust, there seemed no reason for the dice, but there never was
 a bloody reason he could see until it was too late. Whatever was coming might
 lie days in the future or only an hour, but he had never been able to figure
 it out ahead of time. The only certainties were that something important&mdash;or
 dire&mdash;was going to happen and that he would not be able to avoid it.
 Sometimes, like that night at the gate, he did not understand why the dice
 had been tumbling even after they stopped. All he really knew for sure was
 that however much the dice made him twitch like a goat with the itch, once
 they started, he did not want them to stop ever. But they did. Sooner or
 later, they always did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are
you all right, Mat?&rdquo; Olver said. &ldquo;Those Seanchan can&rsquo;t catch us.&rdquo; He attempted
gruff conviction, but a hint of question hung in his voice.</p>

<p>Abruptly
Mat realized he had been staring at nothing. Egeanin frowned at him while
fiddling absentmindedly with her wig, plainly angry that he was ignoring her.
Domon&rsquo;s eyes had a studious look; if he was not deciding whether to be upset
on Egeanin&rsquo;s behalf, Mat would eat his
cap. Even Thera was peeking at him past the tent&rsquo;s entry flap, and she always
tried to keep out of Egeanin&rsquo;s sight. He could not explain. Only a man with
porridge for brains would believe he got warnings from hearing dice no one
could see. Or maybe a man marked by the Power. Or by the Dark One. He was not
anxious to have any of those things suspected about him. And it might be that
night at the gate all over again. No, this was not a secret he cared to reveal.
It would do no good, anyway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll never catch us, Olver, not you and me.&rdquo; He ruffled the boy&rsquo;s
hair, and Olver gave a wide-mouthed grin, confidence restored as easy as that.
&ldquo;Not so long as we keep our eyes open and our wits about us. Remember, you can
find a way out of any difficulty if you keep your eyes and wits sharp, but if
you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll trip over your own feet.&rdquo; Olver nodded gravely, but Mat meant
the reminder for the others. Or maybe himself. Light, there was no way any of
them could be more alert. Except for Olver, who thought it was all a great
adventure, they had all been jumping out of their skins since before leaving
the city. &ldquo;Go help Thera like Juilin told you, Olver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A sharp gust cut through Mat&rsquo;s coat, making him shiver. &ldquo;And put your
coat on; it&rsquo;s cold,&rdquo; he added as the boy ducked past Thera into the tent.
Rustles and scraping sounds from inside said that Olver was setting to work,
with or without his coat, but Thera remained crouched at the tent&rsquo;s entrance,
peering at Mat. For all the care anybody but Mat Cauthon took, the boy could
catch his death.</p>

<p>As soon as Olver disappeared, Egeanin stepped closer
to Mat, her fists on her hips again, and he groaned under his breath. &ldquo;We are
going to settle matters now, Cauthon,&rdquo; she said in a hard voice. &ldquo;Now! I won&rsquo;t
have our journey wrecked by you countermanding my orders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to settle,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;I was never your hired hand,
and that&rsquo;s that.&rdquo; Somehow, her face managed to grow harder, as good as shouting
that she did not see matters like that. The woman was as tenacious as a
snapping turtle, but there had to be some way to pry her jaws from his leg.
Burn him if he wanted to be alone with the dice rolling in his head, yet that
was better than having to listen to them while arguing with her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
see Tuon before we leave.&rdquo; The words popped out of his mouth before they were
clear in his head. He realized that they had been lying there for some time,
though, murky and slowly solidifying.</p>

<p>The blood drained from Egeanin&rsquo;s cheeks as soon as Tuon&rsquo;s name left his
mouth, and he heard a squeak from Thera followed by the snap of the tentflaps
being jerked shut. The onetime panarch had absorbed a great many Seanchan ways
while she was Suroth&rsquo;s property, and many of their taboos as well. Egeanin was
made of harder stuff, however. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she demanded. In almost the same breath,
she went on, anxious and furious all at once. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t call her that. You
must show respect.&rdquo; Harder in some ways.</p>

<p>Mat grinned, but she did not seem to see the joke. Respect?
There was precious little respect in stuffing a gag in someone&rsquo;s mouth and
rolling them up in a wall hanging. Calling Tuon High Lady or anything else was
not going to change that. Of course, Egeanin was more willing to talk about
freeing <em>damane</em> than she was about Tuon. If she could have pretended the
kidnapping never happened, she would have, and as it was, she tried. Light, she
had tried to ignore it while it was happening. In her mind, any other crimes
she might have committed paled to nothing beside that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I want to talk with her,&rdquo; he said. And why
not? He had to, sooner or later. People had begun trotting up and down the
narrow street, now, half-dressed men with their shirts hanging out and women
with their hair still wrapped in night-kerchiefs, some leading horses and
others just milling about as far as he could make out. A wiry boy a little
bigger than Olver went past doing handsprings wherever the crowd gave him a
pace of room, practicing or maybe playing. The sleepy fellow in the deep green
wagon still had not appeared. Luca&rsquo;s Grand Traveling Show would not be
traveling anywhere for hours yet. There was plenty of time. &ldquo;You could come
with me,&rdquo; he suggested in his most innocent voice. He should have thought of
this before.</p>

<p>The invitation made Egeanin go fence-post stiff for
true. It hardly seemed possible her face could grow any paler, but an extra
scrap of color leached out. &ldquo;You will show her fitting respect,&rdquo; she said
hoarsely, clutching the knotted scarf with both hands as though trying to
squeeze the black wig tighter onto her head. &ldquo;Come, Bayle. I want to make sure
my things are stowed properly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Domon hesitated as she turned and hurried away into
the crowd without looking back, and Mat watched him warily. He had vague
memories of a flight on Domon&rsquo;s rivership, once, but vague was the best he
could say of them. Thom was friendly with Domon, a point in the Illianer&rsquo;s
favor, yet he was Egeanin&rsquo;s man to the knife, ready to back her on anything
down to disliking Juilin, and Mat trusted him no further than he did her. Which
was to say, not very far. Egeanin and Domon had their own goals, and whether
Mat Cauthon kept a whole hide did not factor in them. He doubted that the man
really trusted him, for that matter, but then, neither of them had much choice
at the moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fortune prick me,&rdquo; Domon muttered, scratching the bristles growing
above his left ear, &ldquo;whatever you do be up to, you may be in over your head. I
think she do be tougher than you do suspect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egeanin?&rdquo; Mat said incredulously. He looked around quickly to see
whether anyone in the alley had heard his slip. A few glanced at him and Domon
as they brushed by, but nobody glanced twice. Luca was not the only one eager
to be gone from a city where the flow of patrons for the show had dried up and
night lightning setting the harbor on fire was a fresh memory. They might all
have fled that first night, leaving Mat nowhere to hide, except for Luca
arguing them out of it. That promised gold had made Luca very persuasive. &ldquo;I
know she&rsquo;s tougher than old boots, Domon, but old boots don&rsquo;t count with me.
This isn&rsquo;t a bloody ship, and I&rsquo;m not letting her take charge and ruin
everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Domon grimaced as if Mat were goose-brained. &ldquo;The girl, man. Do you
believe you could be so calm if you did be carried off in the night? Whatever
you be playing at, with that wild talk of her being your wife, have a care or
she may shave your head at the shoulders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just cutting the fool,&rdquo; Mat muttered. &ldquo;How many
times do I have to say it? I was unnerved for a minute.&rdquo; Oh, he had been that.
Learning who Tuon was, while he was wrestling with her, would have unnerved a
bloody Trolloc.</p>

<p>Domon grunted in disbelief. Well, it was hardly the
best story Mat had ever come up with. Except for Domon, everyone who had heard
him babbling seemed to accept the tale, though. Mat thought they had, anyway.
Egeanin might get a knot in her tongue at the very thought of Tuon, but she would have said plenty if she
believed he had been serious. Likely she would have put her knife in him.</p>

<p>Peering in the direction Egeanin had gone, the
Illianer shook his head. &ldquo;Try to keep a grip on your tongue from now on. Eg&mdash;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Leilwin&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;do near have a fit whenever she do think about what you did
say. I&rsquo;ve heard her muttering under her breath, and you can wager the girl
herself does take it no lighter. You &lsquo;cut the fool&rsquo; with her, and you may get
us all shortened.&rdquo; He slid a finger across his throat expressively and gave a
curt nod before pushing through the crowd after Egeanin.</p>

<p>Watching him go, Mat shook his own head. Tuon, tough?
True, she was the Daughter of the Nine Moons and all of that, and she had been
able to get under his skin with a look back in the Tarasin Palace, when he
thought she was just another Seanchan noblewoman with her nose in the air, but
that was just because she kept turning up where he did not expect. No more than
that. Tough? She looked like a doll made of black porcelain. How tough could
she be?</p>

<p><em>It was all you could do to keep her from breaking your nose and maybe more</em>,
he reminded himself.</p>

<p>He had been careful not to repeat what Domon called &ldquo;wild talk,&rdquo; but the
truth of it was, he <em>was</em> going to marry Tuon. The thought made him sigh.
He knew it as sure as prophecy, which it was, in a way. He could not imagine
how such a marriage could come about; it seemed impossible, on the face of it,
and he would not weep if that proved to be so. But he knew it would not. Why
did he always find himself bloody lumbered with bloody women who pulled knives
on him or tried to kick his head off? It was not fair.</p>

<p>He intended to go straight to the wagon where Tuon and Selucia were
being kept, with Setalle Anan to watch&mdash;the innkeeper could make a stone seem
soft; a pampered noblewoman and a lady&rsquo;s maid would give her no trouble,
especially with a Redarm on duty outside. At least, they had not so far, or he
would have heard&mdash;but he found his feet wandering, taking him along the
winding streets that ran through the show. Bustle filled all of them, wide and
narrow alike. Men rushed by leading horses that frisked and shied, too long
without exercise. Other people were taking down tents and packing the storage
wagons, or hauling cloth-wrapped bundles and brass-bound chests and casks and
canisters of every size out of the house-like wagons that had been standing
here for months, partially unloading so everything could be repacked for travel
even while the teams were being harnessed. The din was constant: horses
whickered, women shouted for children, children cried over lost toys or yelled
for the pure pleasure of noise, men bellowed to know who had been at their
harness or who had borrowed some tool. A troupe of acrobats, slender but
muscular women who worked on ropes dangling from tall poles, had surrounded one
of the horse handlers, all of them waving their arms and giving voice at the
top of their lungs and nobody listening. Mat paused a moment trying to figure
out what they were arguing over, but eventually he decided they were not sure
themselves. Two fighting coatless men rolled on the ground, watched closely by
the likely cause, a willowy hot-eyed seamstress named Jameine, but Petra
appeared and pulled them apart before Mat could even get a bet down.</p>

<p>He was not afraid of seeing Tuon again. Of course not. He had stayed
away, after sticking her into that wagon, to give her time to settle down and
collect herself. That was all. Only&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Calm, Domon had called her, and it
was true. Kidnapped in the middle of the night, snatched out into a storm by
people who would as soon have cut her throat as look at her, as far as she
knew, and she had been by far the coolest of them all. Light, she could have
planned it herself, that was how upset she was! It had made him feel as if the
point of a knife were tickling between his shoulder blades then, and the knife
was back again just thinking about her. And those dice were rattling away
inside his skull.</p>

<p><em>The woman&rsquo;s hardly likely to offer to exchange vows
here and now</em>, he thought with a chuckle,
but it sounded forced even to him. Yet there was no reason under the sun for
him to be afraid. He was just properly wary, not afraid.</p>

<p>The show might have equaled a fair-sized village for
size, but there was only so long a man could wander about in that much space
before he started doubling back on himself. Soon enough, too soon, he found himself staring at a windowless wagon
painted in faded purple, surrounded by canvas-topped storage wagons and in
sight of the southernmost horselines. The dung carts had not gone out this
morning, and the odor was strong. The wind carried a heavy scent from the
nearest animal cages, too, a musky smell of big cats and bears and the Light
knew what else. Beyond the storage wagons and pickets, a section of the canvas
wall fell and another began to shake as men loosened the guy ropes holding the
poles. The sun, half-hidden by dark clouds now, had climbed halfway to its
noonday peak or better, but it was still too soon.</p>

<p>Harnan and Metwyn, two of the Redarms, had already hitched the first
pair of horses to the shaft of the purple wagon and were almost done with the
second pair. Soldiers well trained in the Band of the Red Hand, they would be
ready to take the road while the showfolk were still figuring out which way the
horses were supposed to face. Mat had taught the Band to move fast when there
was need. His own feet dragged as though he were wading in mud.</p>

<p>Harnan, with that fool tattoo of a hawk on his cheek,
was the first to see him. Buckling a trace, the heavy-jawed file-leader
exchanged looks with Metwyn, a boyish-faced Cairhienin whose appearance belied
his age and his weakness for tavern brawls. They had no call to look surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything going smoothly? I want to be away in good
time.&rdquo; Rubbing his hands together against the cold, Mat eyed the purple wagon
uneasily. He should have brought her a present, jewelry or flowers. Either
worked as well, with most women.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Smooth enough, my Lord,&rdquo; Harnan replied in a cautious
tone. &ldquo;No shouting, no screaming, no crying.&rdquo; He glanced at the wagon as if he
did not credit it himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quiet suits me,&rdquo; Metwyn said, stringing one of the reins through a ring
on a horse-collar. &ldquo;Woman starts crying, the only thing to do is leave, if you
value your hide, and we can hardly drop these off by the side of the road.&rdquo; But
he glanced at the wagon, too, and shook his head in disbelief.</p>

<p>There really was nothing for Mat to do except go inside. So he did. It
only took two tries, with a smile fixed on his face, to make himself climb the
short flight of painted wooden steps at the back of the wagon. He was not
afraid, but any fool would know enough to be nervous.</p>

<p>Despite the lack of windows, the interior of the wagon
was well lighted, with four mirrored lamps burning, and the lamps held good
oil, so there was no rancid smell. But then, with the stink from outside, it would
have been hard to tell. He needed to find a better spot to park his wagon. A
small brick stove with an iron door, and an iron top for cooking, made the
space toasty compared with outside. It was not a large wagon, and every inch of
wall that could be spared was covered with cabinets or shelves or pegs for
hanging clothing and towels and the like, but the table that could be let down
on ropes was snug against the ceiling, and the three women inside the wagon
were hardly crowded.</p>

<p>They could not have been more different, those three.
Mistress Anan was sitting on one of the two narrow beds built into the walls, a
regal woman with touches of gray in her hair, seemingly intent on her
embroidery hoop and not looking at all as if she were a guard. A large golden
ring hung in each of her ears, and her marriage knife dangled from a
close-fitting silver necklace, the hilt with its red and white stones snug in
the cleavage exposed by the narrow plunging neckline of her Ebou Dari dress
that had one side of the skirt sewn up to expose yellow petticoats. She wore
another knife, with a long, curved blade, tucked behind her belt, but that was
just the custom of Ebou Dar. Setalle had refused to take on any disguise, which
seemed well enough. No one had reason to be hunting for her, and finding
clothes for everyone else had been a big enough problem as it was. Selucia, a
pretty woman with skin the color of buttery cream, was cross-legged on the
floor between the beds, a dark scarf covering her shaven head and a sullen expression
on her face, though normally she was dignified enough to make Mistress Anan
look flighty. Her eyes were as blue as Egeanin&rsquo;s, and more piercing, and she
had made more fuss than Egeanin over losing her the rest of her hair. She
disliked the dark blue Ebou Dari dress she had been given, too, claiming the
deep neckline was indecent, but it hid her as effectively as a mask. Few men
who glimpsed Selucia&rsquo;s impressive bosom would be able to focus long on her
face. Mat might have enjoyed the view for a moment or two himself, but there
was Tuon, seated on the wagon&rsquo;s only stool, a leather-bound book open on her
lap, and he could barely make himself look at anything else. His wife-to-be.
Light!</p>

<p>Tuon was tiny, not just short but almost slim as a
boy, and a loose-fitting dress of brown wool, bought from one of the show-folk,
made her seem a child wearing her older sister&rsquo;s clothes. Not at all the sort
of woman he enjoyed, especially with only a few days&rsquo; growth of black stubble
covering her scalp. If you ignored that, she <em>was</em> pretty, though, in a
reserved way, with her heart-shaped face and full lips, her eyes large dark
liquid pools of serenity. That utter calmness almost unnerved him. Not even an
Aes Sedai would be serene in her circumstances. The bloody dice in his head did
not help matters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Setalle has been keeping me informed,&rdquo; she said in a
cool drawl as he pulled the door shut. He had gotten so he could tell a
difference in Seanchan accents; Tuon&rsquo;s made Egeanin sound as if she had a
mouthful of mush, but they all sounded slurred and slow. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s told me the
story you have put about concerning me, Toy.&rdquo; Tuon had persisted in calling him
that, back in the Tarasin Palace. He had not cared, then. Well, not much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Mat,&rdquo; he began. He never saw where the pottery
cup in her hand came from, but he managed to drop to the floor in time for it
to shatter against the door instead of his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a <em>servant</em>, Toy?&rdquo; If Tuon&rsquo;s tone had been
cool before, now it was deep winter ice. She barely raised her voice, but it
was hard as ice, too. Her expression would have made a hanging judge look
giddy. &ldquo;A <em>thieving</em> servant?&rdquo; The book slid from her lap as she stood and
bent to snatch up the lidded white chamber pot. &ldquo;A <em>faithless</em> servant?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will need that,&rdquo; Selucia said deferentially, slipping the bulbous
pot out of Tuon&rsquo;s hands. Setting it carefully to one side, she crouched at
Tuon&rsquo;s feet almost as if ready to hurl herself at Mat, laughable as that was.
Though nothing much seemed laughable right then.</p>

<p>Mistress Anan reached up to one of the railed shelves
above her head and handed Tuon another cup. &ldquo;We have plenty of these,&rdquo; she
murmured.</p>

<p>Mat shot her an indignant look, but her hazel eyes
twinkled with amusement. Amusement! She was supposed to be <em>guarding</em> those
two!</p>

<p>A fist thumped on the door. &ldquo;Do you need help in there?&rdquo; Harnan called
uncertainly. Mat wondered which of them he was asking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have everything well in hand,&rdquo; Setalle called
back, calmly pushing her needle through the fabric stretched on her hoop. You
would have thought that needlework was the most important thing. &ldquo;Go on about
your work. Don&rsquo;t dawdle.&rdquo; The woman was not Ebou Dari, but she certainly had
soaked up Ebou Dari ways. After a moment, boots thumped back down the steps
outside. It seemed Harnan had been too long in Ebou Dar, as well.</p>

<p>Tuon turned the new cup in her hands as though examining the flowers
painted on it, and her lips quirked in a smile so small it almost might have
been Mat&rsquo;s imagination. She was more than pretty when she smiled, but it was one
of those smiles that said she knew things he did not. He was going to break out
in hives if she kept doing that. &ldquo;I will not be known as a servant, Toy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Mat, not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that other thing,&rdquo; he said, climbing to his
feet and cautiously testing his hip. To his surprise, it ached no worse after
smacking the floorboards. Tuon arched an eyebrow and hefted the cup in one
hand. &ldquo;I could hardly tell the showfolk I&rsquo;d kidnapped the Daughter of the Nine
Moons,&rdquo; he said in exasperation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The High Lady Tuon, peasant!&rdquo; Selucia said crisply.
&ldquo;She is under the veil!&rdquo; Veil? Tuon had worn a veil in the palace, but not
since.</p>

<p>The tiny woman gestured graciously, a queen granting
license. &ldquo;It is of no import, Selucia. He is ignorant, yet. We must educate
him. But you will change this story, Toy. I will not be a servant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late to change anything,&rdquo; Mat said, keeping
an eye on that cup. Her hands looked frail, with those long fingernails cut
short, but he remembered how quick they were. &ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s asking you to <em>be</em> a
servant.&rdquo; Luca and his wife knew the truth, but there had to be some reason to
give everyone else why Tuon and Selucia were kept confined to this wagon and
guarded. The perfect solution had been a pair of serving girls, about to be
dismissed for theft, who had intended to betray their mistress&rsquo;s flight with
her lover. It seemed perfect to Mat, anyway. To the showfolk, it only added to
the romance. He had thought Egeanin was going to swallow her tongue while he
was explaining to Luca. Maybe she had known how Tuon would take it. Light, he
almost wished the dice would stop. How could a man think with that in his head?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t leave you behind to raise an alarm,&rdquo; he went on patiently.
That was true, as far as it went. &ldquo;I know Mistress Anan has explained it to
you.&rdquo; He thought about saying he had been babbling from nerves when he said she
was his wife&mdash;she must think him a complete looby!&mdash;but it seemed best not to
bring it up again. If she was willing to let the matter lie, all the better. &ldquo;I
know she&rsquo;s already told you this, but I promise no one&rsquo;s going to hurt you.
We&rsquo;re not after ransom, just getting away with our heads still attached. As
soon as I can figure out how to send you home safe and sound, I will. I
promise. I&rsquo;ll make you as comfortable as I can until then. You&rsquo;ll just have to
put up with the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tuon&rsquo;s big dark eyes crackled, heat lightning in a
night sky, but she said, &ldquo;It seems I will see what your promises are worth,
Toy.&rdquo; At her feet, Selucia hissed like a doused cat, her head half-turning as
if to object, but Tuon&rsquo;s left hand wiggled, and the blue-eyed woman blushed and
went silent. The Blood used something like Maiden handtalk with their upper
servants. Mat wished he understood the signals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Answer me a question, Tuon,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>He thought he heard Setalle murmur, &ldquo;Fool.&rdquo; Selucia&rsquo;s
jaw knotted, and a dangerous look kindled in Tuon&rsquo;s eyes, but if she was going
to call him &ldquo;Toy,&rdquo; he would be burned if he gave her any titles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo; He had heard that she was only a
few years younger than he, but looking at her in that sack of a dress, it
seemed impossible.</p>

<p>To his surprise, that dangerous spark burst into
flame. Not just heat lightning, this time. He should have been fried on the
spot. Tuon threw back her shoulders and drew herself to her full height. Such
as that was; he doubted she could reach five feet with her heels flat however
she stretched. &ldquo;My fourteenth true-name day will come in five months,&rdquo; she said
in a voice that was far from cold. In fact, it could have heated
the wagon better than the stove. He felt a moment of hope, but she was not
finished. &ldquo;No; you keep your birth names here, don&rsquo;t you. That will be my
twentieth naming day. Are you satisfied, Toy? Did you fear you had stolen a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;child?&rdquo; She almost hissed the last word.</p>

<p>Mat
waved his hands in front of him, frantically dismissing the suggestion. A woman
started hissing at him like a kettle, a man with any brains found a way to cool
her down fast. She was gripping the cup so tightly that tendons stood out on
the back of her hand, and he did not want to try his hip with another fall to
the floor. Come to think on it, he was not sure how hard she had tried to hit
him the first time. Her hands were very fast. &ldquo;I just wanted to know, that&rsquo;s
all,&rdquo; he said quickly. &ldquo;I was curious, making conversation. I&rsquo;m only a little
older myself.&rdquo; Twenty. So much for hoping she was too young to marry for
another three or four years. Anything that came between him and his wedding day
would have been welcome.</p>

<p>Tuon studied
him suspiciously with her head tilted, then tossed the cup onto the bed beside
Mistress Anan and seated herself on the stool again, taking as much care about
arranging her voluminous woolen skirts as if they had belonged to a silk gown.
But she continued to examine him through her long eyelashes. &ldquo;Where is your
ring?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>

<p>Unconsciously,
he thumbed the finger on his left hand where the long ring usually lay. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t wear it all the time.&rdquo; Not when everybody in the Tarasin Palace knew he
wore it. The thing would have stood out, with his rough layabout&rsquo;s garb, in any
case. It was not even his signet, anyway, just a carver&rsquo;s try-piece. Strange,
how his hand felt noticeably lighter without it. Too light. Strange that she
remarked on it, too. But then, why not? Light, those dice had him shying at
shadows and jumping at sighs. Or maybe it was just her, a discomforting
thought.</p>

<p>He
moved to sit on the unoccupied bed, but Selucia swung herself up onto it so
quickly any of the acrobats might have been jealous, and stretched out with her
head propped on her hand. That pushed her scarf askew for a moment, but she
hurriedly straightened it, all the while staring at him proud and cold as a
queen. He looked at the other bed, and Mistress Anan set down her embroidery long enough to ostentatiously smooth her
skirts, making it clear she did not intend to share an inch. Burn her, she was
behaving as though she were guarding Tuon from him! Women always seemed to club
together so a man never had a fair chance. Well, he had managed to keep Egeanin
from taking charge so far, and he was not about to be bullied by Setalle Anan
or a bosomy lady&rsquo;s maid or the high and mighty High Lady Daughter of the Nine
bloody Moons! Only, he could hardly go shoving one of them out of the way to
find a place to sit.</p>

<p>Leaning against a drawered cabinet at the foot of the bed Mistress Anan
was seated on, he tried to think of what to say. He never had trouble thinking
of what to say to women, but his brain seemed deafened by the sound of those
dice. All three women gave him disapproving looks&mdash;he could all but hear one
of them telling him not to slouch!&mdash;so he smiled. Most women thought his best
smile very winning.</p>

<p>Tuon let out a long breath that did not sound won over
in the slightest. &ldquo;Do you remember Hawkwing&rsquo;s face, Toy?&rdquo; Mistress Anan blinked
in surprise, and Selucia sat up on the bed frowning. At him. Why would she
frown at <em>him?</em> Tuon just continued to look at him, hands folded in her
lap, as cool and collected as a Wisdom at Sunday.</p>

<p>Mat&rsquo;s smile felt frozen. Light, what did she know? How
could she know anything? <em>He lay beneath the burning sun, holding his side
with both hands, trying to keep the last of life from leaking out and wondering
whether there was any reason to hold on. Aideshar was finished, after this
day&rsquo;s work. A shadow blotted the sun for an instant, and then a tall man in
armor crouched beside him, helmet tucked under his arm, dark deep-set eyes
framing a hooked nose. &ldquo;You fought well against me today, Culain, and many days
past,&rdquo; that memorable voice said. &ldquo;Will you live with me in peace?&rdquo; With his
last breath, he laughed in Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s face.</em> He <em>hated</em> to
remember dying. A dozen other encounters skittered through his mind, too,
ancient memories that were his, now. Artur Paendrag had been a difficult man to
get along with even before the wars started.</p>

<p>Drawing a deep breath, he took care choosing his words. This was no time
to go spouting the Old Tongue. &ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he lied. A man who could
not lie convincingly got short shrift from women. &ldquo;Light, Hawkwing died a thousand years ago! What kind of question
is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her mouth opened slowly, and for a moment he was sure she meant to
answer question with question. &ldquo;A foolish one, Toy,&rdquo; she replied finally,
instead. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say why it popped into my head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stiffness in Mat&rsquo;s shoulders relaxed, a little. Of
course. He was <em>ta&rsquo;veren.</em> People did things and said things around him
they never would elsewhere. Nonsense qualified. Still, a thing like that could
become uncomfortable when it hit too close to home. &ldquo;My name is Mat. Mat
Cauthon.&rdquo; He might as well not have spoken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot say what I will do after returning to Ebou
Dar, Toy. I have not decided. I may have you made <em>da&rsquo;covale.</em> You are not
pretty enough for a cupbearer, but it might please me to have you for one.
Still, you have represented certain promises to me, so it pleases me now to
promise, as well. So long as you keep your promises, I will neither escape nor
betray you in any way, nor will I cause dissension among your followers. I
believe that covers everything necessary.&rdquo; This time, Mistress Anan gaped at
her, and Selucia made a sound in her throat, but Tuon appeared not to notice
either woman. She just looked at him expectantly, waiting on a response.</p>

<p>He made a sound in his throat, too. Not a whimper,
just a sound. Tuon&rsquo;s face was as smooth as a stern mask of dark glass. Her calm
was madness, but this made gibbering look sane! She would <em>have</em> to be
insane to think he would believe that offer. Except, he thought she did mean
it. That, or she was a better liar than he ever hoped to be. Again he had that
queasy sense that she knew more than he did. Ridiculous, of course, but there
it was. He swallowed a lump in his throat. A hard lump.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that does all right for you,&rdquo; he said, trying
to buy time, &ldquo;but what about Selucia?&rdquo; Time for what? He could not think with
those dice pounding in his skull.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Selucia follows my wishes, Toy,&rdquo; Tuon said
impatiently. The blue-eyed woman herself straightened and stared at him as
though indignant that he had doubted that. For a lady&rsquo;s maid, she could look
fierce when she tried.</p>

<p>Mat did not know what to say or do. Without thinking,
he spat on his palm and offered his hand as if sealing a bargain on a horse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your customs are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;earthy,&rdquo; Tuon said in a dry
voice, but she spat on her own palm and clasped his hand. &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;Thus is our treaty
written; thus is agreement made.&rsquo; What does that writing on your spear mean,
Toy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did whimper this time, and not because she had read the Old Tongue inscription
on his <em>ashandarei.</em> A bloody stone would have whimpered. The dice had
stopped as soon as he touched her hand. Light, what had happened?</p>

<p>Knuckles rapped on the door, and he was so on edge that he moved without
thought, spinning, a knife coming into either hand ready to throw at whatever
came in. &ldquo;Stay behind me,&rdquo; he snapped.</p>

<p>The door opened, and Thom stuck his head in. The hood
of his cloak was up, and Mat realized it was raining outside. Between Tuon and
the dice, he had missed the sound of rain hitting the wagon&rsquo;s roof. &ldquo;I trust
I&rsquo;m not interrupting anything?&rdquo; Thom said, knuckling his long white mustaches.</p>

<p>Mat&rsquo;s face heated. Setalle had frozen with her embroidery needle
trailing blue thread down to her work, and her eyebrows seemed to be trying to
climb over the top of her head. Tensed on the edge of the other bed, Selucia
watched him slip the knives back up his sleeves with considerable interest. He
would not have thought she was the sort to like dangerous men. That kind of
woman was worth avoiding; they tended to find ways to make a man need to be
dangerous. He did not glance back at Tuon. She was probably staring at him as
if he had been capering like Luca. Just because he did not want to get married
did not mean he wanted his future wife to think him a fool.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you find out, Thom?&rdquo; he asked brusquely. <em>Something</em> had
happened, or the dice would not have stopped. A thought came that made his hair
want to stand on end. This was the second time they had stopped in Tuon&rsquo;s
presence. The third, counting the gate leading out of Ebou Dar. Three bloody
times, and all tied to her.</p>

<p>Limping slightly, the white-haired man came the rest
of the way in, pushing back his hood, and pulled the door shut behind him. His
limp came from an old injury, not trouble in the city. Tall and lean and
leathery, with sharp blue eyes and snowy mustaches that hung below his chin, it
seemed he would draw attention wherever he went, but he had practice at hiding
in plain sight, and his dark bronze coat and brown wool cloak were suitable for
a man with a little coin to spend but not too much. &ldquo;The streets are full of
rumors about her,&rdquo; he said, nodding toward Tuon, &ldquo;but nothing about her
disappearing. I bought drinks for a few Seanchan officers, and they seem to
believe she&rsquo;s snug in the Tarasin Palace or off on an inspection trip. I didn&rsquo;t
sense any dissembling, Mat. They didn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you expect public announcements, Toy?&rdquo; Tuon said
incredulously. &ldquo;As it is, Suroth may be considering taking her own life for the
shame. Do you expect her to spread such an ill omen for the Return about for
everyone to see on top of that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Egeanin had been right. It still seemed impossible.
And it did not seem at all important compared to the dice stopping. What had <em>happened?</em>
He had shaken hands with Tuon, that was all. Shaken hands and made a
bargain. He meant to keep his side, but what had the dice told him? That she
would keep hers? Or that she would not? For all he knew, Seanchan noblewomen
were in the habit of marrying&mdash;what was it she had said she was going to make
him?&mdash;a cupbearer&mdash;maybe they married cupbearers all the time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more, Mat,&rdquo; Thom said, eyeing Tuon thoughtfully, and with a
hint of surprise. It came to Mat that she did not appear overly concerned that
Suroth might kill herself. Maybe she was as tough as Domon thought. What <em>were</em>
the bloody dice trying to tell him? That was what was important. Then Thom
went on, and Mat forgot about how tough Tuon might be and even the dice.
&ldquo;Tylin&rsquo;s dead. They&rsquo;re keeping it quiet for fear of disturbances, but one of
the Palace Guards, a young lieutenant who couldn&rsquo;t hold his brandy, told me
they&rsquo;re planning her funeral feast and Beslan&rsquo;s coronation for the same day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; Mat demanded. She was older than he, but not that much older!
Beslan&rsquo;s coronation. Light! How would Beslan cope with that, when he hated the
Seanchan? It had been his plan to fire those supplies on the Bay Road. He would
have tried an uprising if Mat had not convinced him it would only result in a
slaughter, and not of Seanchan.</p>

<p>Thom hesitated, stroking his mustaches with a thumb. Finally, he
sighed. &ldquo;She was found in her bedchamber the morning after we left, Mat, still
bound hand and foot. Her head&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Her head had been torn off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat did not realize his knees had given way until he
found himself sitting on the floor with his head buzzing. He could hear her
voice. <em>You&rsquo;ll get your head cut off yet if you&rsquo;re not careful, piglet, and I
wouldn&rsquo;t like that.</em> Setalle leaned forward on the narrow bed to press a hand
against his cheek in commiseration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Windfinders?&rdquo; he said hollowly. He did not have
to say more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;According to what that lieutenant said, the Seanchan
have settled on Aes Sedai for the blame. Because Tylin had sworn the Seanchan
oaths. That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ll announce at her funeral feast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tylin dies the same night the Windfinders escape, and
the Seanchan believe Aes Sedai killed her?&rdquo; He could not imagine Tylin dead. <em>I&rsquo;m
going to have you for supper, duckling.</em> &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t make sense, Thom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom hesitated, frowning as he considered. &ldquo;It could
be political, in part, but I think that&rsquo;s what they really believe, Mat. That
lieutenant said they&rsquo;re sure the Windfinders were running too hard to stop or
go out of their way, and the quickest path out of the palace from the <em>damane</em>
kennels goes nowhere near Tylin&rsquo;s apartments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat grunted. He was sure it was not so. And if it
were, there was nothing in the world he could do about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <em>marath&rsquo;damane</em> had reason to murder
Tylin,&rdquo; Selucia said suddenly. &ldquo;They must fear her example for others. What
reason had the <em>damane</em> you speak of? None. The hand of justice requires
motive and proof, even for <em>damane</em> and <em>da&rsquo;covale.</em>&rdquo; She sounded as
though she were reading the words off a page. And she was looking at Tuon from
the corner of her eye.</p>

<p>Mat looked over his shoulder, but if the tiny woman had been using her
hands to tell Selucia what to say, they were resting in her lap, now. She was
watching him, a neutral expression on her face. &ldquo;Did you care for Tylin so
deeply?&rdquo; she said in a cautious voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. No. Burn me, I <em>liked</em> her!&rdquo; Turning away, he scrubbed fingers through his hair, pushing the cap off. He had
never been so glad to get away from a woman in his life, but this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;! &ldquo;And
I left her tied up and gagged so she couldn&rsquo;t even call for help, easy prey for
the <em>gholam</em>,&rdquo; he said bitterly. &ldquo;It was looking for me. Don&rsquo;t shake your
head. Thom. You know it as well as I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>gholam?</em>&rdquo; Tuon asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shadowspawn, my Lady,&rdquo; Thom said. He frowned worriedly. He did not
take easily to worry, but anybody except a fool would worry about a <em>gholam.</em> &ldquo;It
looks like a man, but it can slip through a mousehole, or under a door, and
it&rsquo;s strong enough to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He harrumphed through his mustaches. &ldquo;Well,
enough of that. Mat, she could have had a hundred guards around her, and it
wouldn&rsquo;t have stopped that thing.&rdquo; She would not have needed a hundred guards
if she had not taken up with Mat Cauthon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A <em>gholam</em>,&rdquo; Tuon murmured wryly. Suddenly she
rapped Mat hard on the top of the head with her knuckles. Clapping a hand to
his scalp, he stared over his shoulder incredulously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very happy that you
show loyalty to Tylin, Toy,&rdquo; she told him in a severe voice, &ldquo;but I won&rsquo;t have
superstition in you. I will not have it. It does Tylin no honor.&rdquo; Burn him,
Tylin&rsquo;s death seemed to concern her as little as whether or not Suroth
committed suicide. What kind of woman was he going to marry?</p>

<p>When a fist pounded on the door this time, he did not even bother to
stand. He felt numb at the core and scraped raw on the surface. Blaeric pushed
into the wagon without asking, his dark brown cloak dripping rain. It was an
old cloak, worn thin in spots, but he appeared not to care whether rain leaked
through. The Warder ignored everyone but Mat, or almost everyone. The man
actually took a moment to consider Selucia&rsquo;s bosom! &ldquo;Joline wants you,
Cauthon,&rdquo; he said, still studying her. Light! This was all Mat needed to make
it a fine day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is Joline?&rdquo; Tuon demanded.</p>

<p>Mat ignored her. &ldquo;Tell Joline I&rsquo;ll see her once we&rsquo;re on the road,
Blaeric.&rdquo; The last thing he wanted was to be forced to listen to more of the
Aes Sedai&rsquo;s grievances now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She wants you now, Cauthon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a sigh, Mat got to his feet and gathered his cap
from the floor. Blaeric looked as if he might try to drag him, otherwise. In
his own current mood, he thought he might put a knife in the man if he tried.
And get his neck broken for his pains; a Warder would not take a knife in the
ribs lightly. He was fairly sure he had already died the one time he was
allowed, and not in an old memory. Sure enough not to take risks he could
sidestep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is Joline, Toy?&rdquo; If he had not known better, he
would have said Tuon sounded jealous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A bloody Aes Sedai,&rdquo; he grumbled, tugging the cap on, and got one small
pleasure for the day. Tuon&rsquo;s jaw dropped in shock. He shut the door behind him
on the way out before she could find a word to say. A very small pleasure. One
butterfly on a midden heap. Tylin dead, and the Windfinders might take the
blame yet, whatever Thom said. And that was aside from Tuon and the bloody
dice. A very tiny butterfly on a very large midden.</p>

<p>The sky was full of dark clouds, now, and the downpour
steady. A soaking rain, they would have called it back home. It began to slick
his hair, cap or no, and seep through his coat as soon as he stepped outside.
Blaeric hardly seemed to notice, barely gathering his cloak. There was nothing
for it but for Mat to hunch his shoulders and splash through the widening
puddles on the dirt streets. By the time he could reach his wagon for a cloak,
he would be drenched to the skin anyway. Besides, the weather fit his spirits.</p>

<p>To his surprise, rain or no rain, an incredible amount of work had been
done in the short time he was inside. The canvas wall was gone as far as he
could see in either direction, and half the storage wagons that had been around
Tuon&rsquo;s wagon were missing, too. So were most of the animals that had been
picketed on the horselines. A large, iron-barred cage containing a black-maned lion
trundled past toward the road behind a plodding team, the horses as unconcerned
with the apparently sleeping lion behind them as they were with the shower.
Performers were already taking to the road, too, though how they determined the
order of leaving was a mystery. Most of the tents seemed to have vanished; in
one place three of the brightly colored wagons together might be missing,
another place every second wagon, while elsewhere the wagons standing and
waiting still seemed a solid mass. The only thing that said the showfolk were
not scattering was Luca himself, a bright red cloak gathered around him against
the wet as he paraded along the street, stopping now and then to clap a man on
the shoulder or murmur something to a woman that made her laugh. If the show
had been breaking apart, Luca would have been out chasing down those who tried
to leave. He held the show together as much by persuasion as anything else, and
he never let anyone leave without talking himself hoarse trying to argue them
out of it. Mat knew he should feel good about seeing Luca still there, though
it had never occurred to him that the man would run out on the gold, but right
at that moment, he doubted that anything could make him feel anything but numb
and angry.</p>

<p>The wagon that Blaeric took him to was almost as large
as Luca&rsquo;s, but it had been whitewashed rather than painted. The white had long
since run and streaked and faded, and the rain was washing it a little more
toward gray, where the wood was not already bare. The wagon belonged to a
company of fools, four morose men who painted their faces for the show&rsquo;s
patrons, dousing each other with water and hitting each other with inflated
pig-bladders, and otherwise spent their time and money imbibing as much wine as
they could buy. With what Mat had paid for rent, they might be drunk for
months, and it had cost more than that to make anyone take them in.</p>

<p>Four shaggy, nondescript horses were already hitched
to the wagon, and Fen Mizar, Joline&rsquo;s other Warder, was up on the driver&rsquo;s seat,
swathed in an old gray cloak and reins in hand. His tilted eyes watched Mat the
way a wolf might watch an impudent cur. The Warders had been unhappy with Mat&rsquo;s
plan from the start, sure they could have gotten the sisters away safely once
they were outside the city walls. Perhaps they could have, but the Seanchan
hunted vigorously for women who could channel&mdash;the show itself apparently had
been searched four times in the days after Ebou Dar fell&mdash;and all it would
have taken was one slip to land all of them in the stewpot. From what Egeanin
and Domon said, the Seekers could make a boulder tell everything it had ever
seen. Luckily, not all the sisters were as sure as Joline&rsquo;s Warders. Aes Sedai
tended to dither when they could not agree on what to do.</p>

<p>When Mat reached the steps at the back of the wagon,
Blaeric stopped him with a hand to his chest. The Warder&rsquo;s face might have been
carved, no more concerned than a piece of wood with the rain
running down his cheeks. &ldquo;Fen and I are grateful to you for getting her
out of the city, Cauthon, but this can&rsquo;t continue. The sisters are crowded,
sharing with those other women, and they don&rsquo;t get on. There is going to be
trouble if we can&rsquo;t find another wagon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that
what this is about?&rdquo; Mat said crossly, tugging his collar tighter. Not that it
did much good. He was already wet through on the back, and not much better in
front. If Joline had pulled him here to whine about the accommodations again&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll tell
you what it&rsquo;s about, Cauthon. Just you remember what I said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grumbling
under his breath, Mat climbed the dirt-streaked steps and went in, not quite
slamming the door behind him.</p>

<p>The
wagon was laid out much like the one Tuon was in, though with four beds, two of
them folded flat against the walls above the other two. He had no idea how the
six women arranged sleeping, but he suspected it was not done peacefully. The
air in the wagon all but crackled like grease on a griddle. Three women sat on
each of the lower beds, each variously watching or ignoring the women seated on
the other bed. Joline, who had never been held as <em>damane</em>, behaved as
though the three <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> did not exist. Reading a small wood-bound book,
she was an Aes Sedai to the inch and arrogance on a stick despite her well-worn
blue dress, lately owned by a woman who taught the lions to do tricks. The
other two sisters knew firsthand what it was to be <em>damane</em>, though.
Edesina watched the three <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> warily, one hand resting near her belt
knife, while Teslyn&rsquo;s eyes shifted constantly, looking at anything except the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>,
and her hands kneaded her dark woolen skirts. He did not know how Egeanin
had coerced the three <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> into helping <em>damane</em> escape, but
even though they were being sought by the authorities as surely as Egeanin,
they had not changed their attitudes toward women who could channel. Bethamin,
tall and as dark as Tuon in an Ebou Dari dress with a very deep neckline and
skirts sewn up above her knee on one side to show faded red petticoats, seemed
a mother waiting for inevitable misbehavior by children, while yellow-haired
Seta, in high-necked gray wool that covered her completely, appeared to be
studying dangerous dogs that would need to be caged sooner or later. Renna, she
of the talk about cutting off hands and
feet, pretended to be reading, too, but every so often her deceptively mild
brown eyes rose from the slim volume to study the Aes Sedai, and when they did,
she smiled in an unpleasant way. Mat felt like cursing before one of them
opened her mouth. A wise man kept clear when women were at odds, especially if
there were Aes Sedai among them, but this was how it always was when he came to
this wagon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This better be important, Joline.&rdquo; Unbuttoning his
coat, he tried to shake some of the water off. He thought he would do better
wringing the garment out. &ldquo;I just learned that the <em>gholam</em> killed Tylin
the night we left, and I&rsquo;m in no mood for complaints.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joline marked her place carefully with an embroidered marker and folded
her hands on the book before speaking. Aes Sedai never hurried; they just
expected everyone else to. Without him, she likely would have been wearing an <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>
by now herself, but he had never found Aes Sedai particularly noted for
gratitude, either. She ignored what he had said about Tylin. &ldquo;Blaeric tells me the
show has already begun moving,&rdquo; she said coolly, &ldquo;but you must stop it. Luca
will only listen to you.&rdquo; Her mouth tightened slightly on the words. Aes Sedai
also were unused to not being listened to, and Greens were not the best at
hiding their displeasure. &ldquo;We must abandon the idea of Lugard for the time
being. We must take the ferry across the harbor and go to Illian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was about as bad a suggestion as he had heard out
of her, though she did not mean it for a suggestion, of course; she was worse
than Egeanin that way. With half the show already on the road, or near enough,
it would take all day just to get everyone down to the ferry landing, and it
would mean going into the city, besides. Heading for Lugard took the show away
from the Seanchan as quickly as possible, while they had soldiers camped all
the way to the Illian border and maybe beyond. Egeanin was reluctant to tell
what she knew, but Thom had his ways of learning these things. Mat did not
bother to crack his teeth, though. He did not need to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Teslyn said in a tight voice, her Illianer
accent strong. Leaning past Edesina, she looked as though she chewed rocks
three meals a day, hard-faced and set-jawed, but there was a nervousness in her
eyes, put there by her weeks as a <em>damane.</em> &ldquo;No, Joline. I have told you,
we do no dare risk it! We do no dare!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light!&rdquo; Joline spat, slamming her book to the floor.
&ldquo;Take hold of yourself, Teslyn! Just because you were held prisoner for a
little time is no reason to go to pieces!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go to pieces? Go to pieces? Let them put that collar
on you and then speak of going to pieces!&rdquo; Teslyn&rsquo;s hand went to her throat as
though she felt the <em>a&rsquo;dam&rsquo;s</em> collar still. &ldquo;Help me convince her,
Edesina. She will have us collared again, if we do let her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edesina drew back on herself against the wall behind the bed&mdash;a slim,
handsome woman with black hair spilling to her waist, she always went silent
when the Red and the Green argued, as they did often&mdash;but Joline did not spare
her so much as a glance. &ldquo;You ask a <em>rebel</em> for help, Teslyn? We should
have left her for the Seanchan! Listen to me. You can feel it as well as I.
Would you really accept a greater danger to avoid a lesser?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lesser!&rdquo; Teslyn snarled. &ldquo;You do know nothing of&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Renna held her book out at arm&rsquo;s length and let it drop to the floor
with a bang. &ldquo;If my Lord will excuse us a little while, we still have our <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>,
and we can teach these girls to behave again in short order.&rdquo; Her accent
had a musical quality, but the smile on her lips never touched her brown eyes.
&ldquo;It never works to let them go slack this way.&rdquo; Seta nodded grimly and stood as
if to fetch out the leashes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re done with <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>,&rdquo; Bethamin said, ignoring the
shocked looks from the other two <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>, &ldquo;but there are other ways to
settle these girls down. May I suggest my Lord return in an hour? They&rsquo;ll tell
you what you want to know without any squabbling once they can&rsquo;t sit down.&rdquo;
She sounded as though she meant exactly what she said. Joline was staring at
the three <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> in outraged disbelief, but Edesina was sitting up
straight, gripping her belt knife with a determined expression, while Teslyn
was now the one shrinking back against the wall, her hands clasped tightly at
her waist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t be necessary,&rdquo; Mat said after a moment. Only a moment.
However satisfying it might be to have Joline &ldquo;settled down,&rdquo; Edesina might
draw that knife, and that would set the cat among the chickens no matter how it
turned out. &ldquo;What greater danger are you talking about, Joline? Joline? What
danger is greater than the Seanchan right now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Green decided her stare was making no impression on Bethamin and
turned it on Mat, instead. Had she been other than Aes Sedai, he would have
said she looked sulky. Joline disliked explaining. &ldquo;If you must know, someone
is channeling.&rdquo; Teslyn and Edesina nodded, the Red sister reluctantly, the
Yellow emphatically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the camp?&rdquo; he said in alarm. His right hand rose on its own to press
against the silver foxhead under his shirt, but the medallion had not turned
cold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Far away,&rdquo; Joline replied, still unwilling. &ldquo;To the north.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much farther than any of us should be able to sense
channeling,&rdquo; Edesina put in, a touch of fear in her voice. &ldquo;The amount of <em>saidar</em>
being wielded must be immense, inconceivable.&rdquo; She fell silent at a sharp
glance from Joline, who turned back to study Mat as though deciding how much
she had to tell him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At that distance,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;we wouldn&rsquo;t be able
to feel every sister in the Tower channeling. It has to be the Forsaken, and
whatever they&rsquo;re doing, we do not want to be any closer than we can avoid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat was still for a moment; then finally, he said, &ldquo;If
it&rsquo;s far, then we stick with the plan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joline went on arguing, but he did not bother to listen. Whenever he
thought of Rand or Perrin, colors swirled in his head. A part of being <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>,
he supposed. This time, he had not thought of either of his friends, but
the colors had suddenly been there, a fan of a thousand rainbows. This time,
they had almost formed an image, a vague impression that might have been a man
and a woman seated on the ground facing one another. It was gone in an instant,
but he knew as surely as he knew his name. Not the Forsaken. Rand. And he
could not help wondering, what had Rand been doing when the dice stopped?</p>
