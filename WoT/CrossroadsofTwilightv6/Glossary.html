<p class="drop"><b>A NOTE ON DATES IN THIS GLOSSARY.</b>
The Toman Calendar (devised by Toma dur Ahmid) was adopted
approximately two centuries after the death of the last male Aes
Sedai, recording years After the Breaking of the World (AB). So
many records were destroyed in the Trolloc Wars that at their end
there was argument about the exact year under the old system. A new
calendar, proposed by Tiam of Gazar, celebrated freedom from the
Trolloc threat and recorded each year as a Free Year (FY). The
Gazaran Calendar gained wide acceptance within twenty years after
the Wars&rsquo; end. Artur Hawkwing attempted to establish a new
calendar based on the founding of his empire (FF, From the
Founding), but only historians now refer to it. After the death and
destruction of the War of the Hundred Years, a third calendar was
devised by Uren din Jubai Soaring Gull, a scholar of the Sea Folk,
and promulgated by the Panarch Farede of Tarabon. The Farede
Calendar, dating from the arbitrarily decided end of the War of the
Hundred Years and recording years of the New Era (NE), is currently
in use.</p>


<dl>

<dt><strong>Arad Doman:</strong></dt>

<dd>A nation
on the Aryth Ocean, currently racked by civil war and by wars against those who
have declared for the Dragon Reborn. Its capital is Bandar Eban. In Arad Doman,
the ruler (king or queen) is elected by a council of the heads of merchant
guilds (the Council of Merchants), who are almost always women. He or she must be
from the noble class, not be a merchant, and is elected for life. Legally the
king or queen has absolute authority, except that he or she can be deposed by
three-quarter vote of the Council. The current ruler is King Alsalam Saeed
Almadar, Lord of Almadar, High Seat of House Almadar. His present whereabouts
are much shrouded in mystery</dd>

<dt><strong>armsmen:</strong></dt>

<dd>Soldiers who owe allegiance or fealty to a particular lord or lady.</dd>

<dt><strong>Asha&rsquo;man:</strong></dt>

<dd>(1) In the Old Tongue, &ldquo;Guardian&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Guardians,&rdquo; but the word always meant a guardian of justice and truth.</dd>

<dd>(2) The
name given, both collectively and as a rank, to the men who have come to the
Black Tower, near Caemlyn in Andor, in order to learn to channel. Their training
concentrates largely on the ways in which the One Power can be used as a
weapon, and in another departure from the usages of the White Tower, once they
learn to seize <em>saidin</em>, the male half of the Power, they are required to
perform all chores and labors with the Power. When newly enrolled, a man is
termed a Soldier, he wears a plain black coat with a high collar, in the
Andoran fashion. Being raised to Dedicated brings the right to wear a silver
pin, called the Sword, on the collar of his coat. Promotion to Asha&rsquo;man brings
the right to wear a Dragon pin, in gold and red enamel, on the collar opposite
the Sword. Although many women, including wives, flee when they learn that their
men actually can channel, a fair number of men at the Black Tower are married,
and they use a version of the Warder bond to create a link with their wives.
This same bond, altered to compel obedience, has recently been used to bond
captured Aes Sedai as well.</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dt><strong>Balwer, Sebban:</strong></dt>

<dd>Formerly secretary to
Pedron Niall (the Lord Captain Commander of the Children of the Light) in
public, and secretly Niall&rsquo;s spymaster. After Niall&rsquo;s death, Balwer aided the
escape of Morgase (once Queen of Andor) from the Seanchan in Amador for his own
reasons, and now is employed as secretary to Perrin t&rsquo;Bashere Aybara and Faile
ni Bashere t&rsquo;Aybara. Perrin is beginning to suspect that there is more to Balwer
than at first appeared.</dd>

<dt><strong>Band of the Red Hand:</strong></dt>

<dd><em>see Shen an Calhar.</em></dd>

<dt><strong>Blood, the:</strong></dt>

<dd>Term used by the Seanchan to designate the nobility. There are degrees of
nobility. The High Blood shave the sides of their heads and paint multiple
fingernails&mdash;the higher the rank, the more nails painted&mdash;but a member of the
lesser Blood, the low Blood, may have only the nails of the little fingers
painted. One can be raised to the Blood as well as born to it, and this is
frequently a reward for outstanding accomplishment or service to the Empire.</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dt><strong>calendar:</strong></dt>

<dd>There are
10 days to the week, 28 days to the month, and 13 months to the year. Several
feastdays are not part of any month, these include Sunday (the longest day of
the year), the Feast of Thanksgiving (once every four years at the spring
equinox), and the Feast of All Souls Salvation, also called All Souls Day (once
every ten years at the autumn equinox). While the months have names&mdash;Taisham,
Jumara, Saban, Aine, Adar, Saven, Amadame, Tammaz, Maigdhal, Choren, Shaldme,
Nesan, and Danu&mdash;these are seldom used except in official documents and by
officials. For most people, using the seasons is good enough.</dd>

<dt><strong>Captain-General:</strong></dt>

<dd>(1) The
military rank of the leader of the Queen&rsquo;s Guard, in Andor. This position is currently
held by Lady Birgitte Trahelion.</dd>

<dd>(2) The title given to the head of the Green
Ajah, though known only to members of the Green. This position is currently held
by Adelorna Bastine in the Tower, and Myrelle Berengan among the rebel Aes
Sedai contingent under Egwene al&rsquo;Vere.</dd>

<dt><strong><em>Cha Faile</em>:</strong></dt>

<dd>(1) In the Old Tongue, &ldquo;the Falcon&rsquo;s Talon&rdquo;.</dd>

<dd>(2) Name
taken by the young Cairhienin and Tairens, attempted followers of <em>jt&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>, who
have sworn fealty to Faile ni Bashere t&rsquo;Aybara. In secret, they act as her
personal scouts and spies. Since her capture by the Shaido, they continue their
activities under the guidance of Sebban Balwer.</dd>

<dt><strong>Children of the Light:</strong></dt>

<dd>Society of strict ascetic beliefs, owing allegiance to
no nation and dedicated to the defeat of the Dark One and the destruction of
all Darkfriends. Founded during the War of the Hundred Years by Lothair Mantelar
to proselytize against an increase in Darkfriends, they evolved during the war
into a completely military society. They are extremely rigid in their beliefs,
and certain that only they know the truth and the right. They consider Aes Sedai
and any who support them to be Darkfriends. Known disparagingly as Whitecloaks,
they were formerly headquartered in Amador, Amadicia, but were forced out when
the Seanchan conquered the city. Their sign is a golden sunburst on a field of
white. <em>See also</em> Questioners.</dd>

<dt><strong>Companions, the:</strong></dt>

<dd>The elite military formation of Illian, currently commanded
by First Captain Demetre Marcolin. The Companions provide a bodyguard for the
King of Illian and guard key points around the nation. Additionally, the
Companions have traditionally been used in battle to assault the enemy&rsquo;s
strongest positions, to exploit weaknesses, and, if necessary, to cover the
retreat of the King. Unlike most other such elite formations, foreigners
(excepting Tairens, Altarans and Murandians) are not only welcome, they can
rise even to the highest rank, as can commoners, which also is unusual. The
uniform of the Companions consists of a green coat, a breastplate worked with
the Nine Bees of Illian, and a conical helmet with a faceguard of steel bars.
The First Captain wears four rings of golden braid on the cuffs of his coat,
and three thin golden plumes on his helmet. The Second Captain wears three rings
of golden braid on each cuff, and three golden plumes tipped with green.
Lieutenants wear two yellow rings on their cuffs, and two thin green plumes,
under-lieutenants one yellow ring and a single green plume. Bannermen are
designated by two broken rings of yellow on the cuffs and a single yellow
plume, squadmen by a single broken ring of yellow.</dd>

<dt><strong>Consolidation, the:</strong></dt>

<dd>When the armies sent by Artur Hawkwing under his son
Luthair landed in Seanchan, they discovered a shifting quilt of nations often
at war with one another, where Aes Sedai often reigned. Without any equivalent
of the White Tower, Aes Sedai worked for their own individual goals, using the
Power. Forming small groups, they schemed against one another constantly. In
large part it was this constant scheming for personal advantage and the
resulting wars among the myriad nations that allowed the armies from east of
the Aryth Ocean to begin the conquest of an entire continent, and for their
descendants to complete it. This conquest, during which the descendants of the
original armies <em>became</em> Seanchan as much as they conquered Seanchan, took more
than nine hundred years and is called the Consolidation.</dd>

<dt><strong><em>Corenne</em>:</strong></dt>

<dd>In the Old Tongue, &ldquo;the Return.&rdquo; The name given by the Seanchan both to the fleet of
thousands of ships and to the hundreds of thousands of soldiers, craftsmen and
others carried by those ships, who will come behind the Forerunners to reclaim
the lands stolen from Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s descendants. <em>See also Hailene.</em></dd>

<dt><strong><em>cuendillar</em>:</strong></dt>

<dd>A supposedly indestructible substance created during
the Age of Legends. Any known force used in an attempt to break it is absorbed,
making <em>cuendillar</em> stronger. Although the making of <em>cuendillar</em> has
been thought lost forever, rumors of new objects made from it have surfaced. It
is also known as heartstone.</dd>

<dt><strong>currency:</strong></dt>

<dd>After many centuries of trade, the standard terms
for coins are the same in every land: crowns (the largest coin in size), marks
and pennies. Crowns and marks can be minted of gold or silver, while pennies can
be silver or copper, the last often called simply a copper. In different lands,
however, these coins can be of different sizes and weights. Even in one nation,
coins of different sizes and weights have been minted by different rulers.
Because of trade, the coins of many nations can be found almost anywhere. For
that reason, bankers, moneylenders and merchants all use scales to determine
the value of any given coin. Even large numbers of coins are weighed for this
reason. The only paper currency is &ldquo;letters-of-rights,&rdquo; which are issued by
bankers, guaranteeing to present a certain amount of gold or silver when the
letter-of-rights is presented. Because of the long distances between cities, the
length of time needed to travel from one to another, and the difficulties of
transactions at long distance, a letter-of-nghts may be accepted at full value
in a city near to the bank that issued it, but it may be accepted only at a
lower value in a city farther away. Generally, someone of means intending a
long journey will carry one or more letters-of-rights to exchange for coin when
needed. Letters-of-rights are usually accepted only by bankers or merchants, and
would never be used in shops.</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dt><strong><em>da&rsquo;covale</em>:</strong></dt>

<dd>(1) In the Old Tongue, this would be translated
literally as &ldquo;one who is owned,&rdquo; or &ldquo;person who is property.&rdquo;</dd>

<dd>(2) Among the
Seanchan, the term often used, along with &ldquo;property,&rdquo; for slaves. Slavery has a
long and unusual history among the Seanchan, with slaves having the ability to
rise to positions of great power and open authority, including over those who
are free. <em>See also so&rsquo;jhin.</em></dd>

<dt><strong>Darkhounds:</strong></dt>

<dd>Shadowspawn created from lupine stock corrupted by the Dark One. While they
resemble hounds in their basic shape, they are blacker than night and the size
of ponies, weighing several hundred pounds each. They usually run in packs of
ten or twelve, although the tracks of a larger pack have been sighted. They make
no mark on soft ground, but leave prints in stone, and are frequently
accompanied by the smell of burned sulphur. They will not usually venture out
into the rain, but once running rain fails to stop them. Once they are on the
trail, they must be confronted and defeated or the victim&rsquo;s death is
inevitable. The only exception to this is when the victim can reach the other
side of a river or stream, since Darkhounds will not cross flowing water. Or
supposedly not. Their blood and saliva are poison, and if either touches the
skin, the victim will die slowly and in great pain. <em>See also</em> Wild Hunt.</dd>

<dt><strong>Daughters of Silence, the:</strong></dt>

<dd>During the history of the White Tower (over three thousand years), various
women who have been put out have been unwilling to accept their fates and have
tried to band together. Such groups&mdash;most of them by far, at least&mdash;have been
dispersed by the White Tower as soon as found and punished severely and
publicly to make sure that the lesson is carried to everyone. The last group to
be dispersed called themselves the Daughters of Silence (794&mdash;798 NE).</dd>

<dd>The Daughters consisted of two Accepted who had been put out of the
Tower and twenty-three women they had gathered and trained. All were carried
back to Tar Valon and punished, and the twenty-three were enrolled in the
novice book. Only one of those, Saerin Asnobar, managed to reach the shawl. <em>See
also</em> Kin, the.</dd>

<dt><strong>Deathwatch Guards, the:</strong></dt>

<dd>The
elite military formation of the Seanchan Empire, including both humans and
Ogier. The human members of the Deathwatch Guard are all <em>da&rsquo;covale</em>, born
as property and chosen while young to serve the Empress, whose personal
property they are. Fanatically loyal and fiercely proud, they often display the
ravens tattooed on their shoulders, the mark of a <em>da&rsquo;covale</em> of the
Empress. The Ogier members are known as Gardeners, and they are not <em>da&rsquo;covale.</em>
The Gardeners are as fiercely loyal as the human Deathwatch Guards, though,
and are even more feared. Human or Ogier, the Deathwatch Guards not only are
ready to die for the Empress and the Imperial family, but believe that their
lives are the property of the Empress, to be disposed of as she wishes. Their
helmets and armor are lacquered in dark green and blood-red, their shields are
lacquered black, and their spears and swords carry black tassels. <em>See also
da&rsquo;covale.</em></dd>

<dt><strong>Defenders of the Stone, the:</strong></dt>

<dd>The elite military formation of Tear. The current Captain of the Stone
(commander of the Defenders) is Rodrivar Tihera. Only Tairens are accepted into
the Defenders, and officers are usually of noble birth, though often from minor
Houses or minor branches of strong Houses. The Defenders are tasked to hold the
great fortress called the Stone of Tear, in the city of Tear, to defend the
city, and to provide police services in place of any City Watch or the like.
Except in times of war, their duties seldom take them far from the city. Then,
as with other elite formations, they are the core around which the army is
formed. The uniform of the Defenders consists of a black coat with padded
sleeves striped black-and-gold with black cuffs, a burnished breastplate, and
a rimmed helmet with a faceguard of steel bars. The Captain of the Stone wears
three short white plumes on his helmet, and on the cuffs of his coat three
intertwined golden braids on a white band. Captains wear two white plumes and a
single line of golden braid on white cuffs, lieutenants one white plume and a
single line of black braid on white cuffs and under-lieutenants one short
black plume and plain white cuffs. Bannermen have gold-colored cuffs on their
coats, and squadmen have cuffs striped black and gold.</dd>

<dt><strong>Delving:</strong></dt>

<dd>(1) Using the One Power to
diagnose physical condition and illness.</dd>

<dd>(2) Finding deposits of metal ores
with the One Power. That this has long been a lost ability among Aes Sedai may
account for the name becoming attached to another ability.</dd>

<dt><strong>Depository:</strong></dt>

<dd>A division
of the Tower Library. There are twelve publicly known Depositories, each having
books and records pertaining to a particular subject, or to related subjects.
A Thirteenth Depository, known only to Aes Sedai, contains secret documents,
records and histories which may be accessed only by the Amyrlin Seat, the
Keeper of the Chronicles, and the Sitters in the Hall of the Tower. And, of
course, by the handful of librarians who maintain the Depository.</dd>

<dt><strong><em>der&rsquo;morat-</em>:</strong></dt>

<dd>(1) In the
Old Tongue, &ldquo;master handler.&rdquo;</dd>

<dd>(2) Among the Seanchan, the prefix applied to
indicate a senior and highly skilled handler of one of the exotics, one who
trains others, as in <em>der&rsquo;morat&rsquo;raken. Der&rsquo;morat</em> can have a fairly high
social status, the highest of all held by <em>der&rsquo;sul&rsquo;dam</em>, the trainers of <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>,
who rank with fairly high military officers. <em>See also morat-.</em></dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dt><strong>Erith:</strong></dt>

<dd>Daughter of Iva daughter of
Alar. An attractive young Ogier woman whom Loial intends to marry, although at
present he is on the run from her.</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dt><strong>Fain, Padan:</strong></dt>

<dd>Former
Darkfriend, now more and worse than a Darkfriend, and an enemy of the Forsaken
as much as he is of Rand al&rsquo;Thor, whom he hates with a passion. Last seen in
Far Madding with Toram Riatin.</dd>

<dt><strong>Fel, Herid:</strong></dt>

<dd>The
author of <em>Reason and Unreason</em> and other books. Fel was a student (and
teacher) of history and philosophy at the Academy of Cairhien. He was discovered
in his study torn limb from limb.</dd>

<dt><strong>First Reasoner:</strong></dt>

<dd>The
title given to the head of the White Ajah. This position is currently held by
Ferane Neheran in the White Tower. Ferane Sedai is one of only two Ajah heads to
sit in the Hall of the Tower at present.</dd>

<dt><strong>First Weaver:</strong></dt>

<dd>The
title given to the head of the Yellow Ajah. This position is currently held by
Suana Dragand in the White Tower. Suana Sedai is one of only two Ajah heads to
sit in the Hall of the Tower at present.</dd>

<dt><strong>Fists of Heaven, the:</strong></dt>

<dd>Lightly
armed and lightly armored Seanchan infantry carried into battle on the backs of
the flying creatures called <em>to&rsquo;raken</em>. All are small men, or women,
largely because of limits as to how much weight a <em>to&rsquo;raken</em> can carry for
any distance. Considered to be among the toughest of soldiers, they are used
primarily for raids, surprise assaults on positions at an enemy&rsquo;s rear, and
where speed in getting soldiers into place is of the essence.</dd>

<dt><strong>Forerunners, the:</strong></dt>

<dd><em>See Hailene.</em></dd>

<dt><strong>Forsaken, the:</strong></dt>

<dd>The name
given to thirteen powerful Aes Sedai, men and women both, who went over to the
Shadow during the Age of Legends and were trapped in the sealing of the Bore
into the Dark One&rsquo;s prison. While it has long been believed that they alone
abandoned the Light during the War of the Shadow, in fact others did as well,
these thirteen were only the highest-ranking among them. The Forsaken (who call
themselves the Chosen) are somewhat reduced in number since their awakening in
the present day. Those thought to have survived are Demandred, Semirhage,
Graendal, Mesaana, Moghedien, and two who were reincarnated in new bodies and
given new names, Osan&rsquo;gar and Aran&rsquo;gar, although it seems possible that
Osan&rsquo;gar may also be dead. The life of a Forsaken is always uncertain. Recently,
a man calling himself Moridin has appeared, and seems to be yet another of the
dead Forsaken brought back from the grave by the Dark One. The same may be
possible regarding the woman calling herself Cyndane, but since Aran&rsquo;gar was a
man brought back as a woman, speculation as to the original identities of
Moridin and Cyndane may prove futile until more is learned.</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dt><strong>Gregorin:</strong></dt>

<dd>Full name Gregorin Panar de Lushenos. A member of the Council of Nine in Illian
who presently serves as the Steward for the Dragon Reborn in Illian.</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dt><strong><em>Hailene</em>:</strong></dt>

<dd>In the Old Tongue, &ldquo;Forerunners,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Those Who Come
Before.&rdquo; The term applied by the Seanchan to the massive expeditionary force
sent across the Aryth Ocean to scout out the lands where Artur Hawkwing once
ruled. Now under the command of the High Lady Suroth, its numbers swollen by
recruits from conquered lands, the <em>Hailene</em> has gone far beyond its
original goals, and has in fact been succeeded by the Return. <em>See</em> Return.</dd>

<dt><strong>Hanlon, Daved:</strong></dt>

<dd>A
Darkfriend, formerly commander of the White Lions in service to the Forsaken
Rahvin while he held Caemlyn using the name Lord Gaebril. From there, Hanlon
took the White Lions to Cairhien under orders to further the rebellion against
the Dragon Reborn. The White Lions were destroyed by a &ldquo;bubble of evil,&rdquo; and
Hanlon has been ordered back to Caemlyn and, under the name Doilen Mellar, has
ingratiated himself with Elayne, the Daughter-Heir. According to rumor, he has
done considerably more than ingratiate himself.</dd>

<dt><strong>Head Clerk:</strong></dt>

<dd>The title given to the head of the Gray Ajah. This position is currently held by
Serancha Corvine, a woman of reputedly fastidious behavior, in the Tower.</dd>

<dt><strong>heart:</strong></dt>

<dd>The basic unit of
organization in the Black Ajah. In effect, a cell. A heart consists of three
sisters who know each other; each member of the heart knows one additional
sister of the Black.</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dt><strong>Illuminators, Guild of:</strong></dt>

<dd>A
society that held the secret of making fireworks. It guarded this secret very
closely, even to the extent of murder. The Guild gained its name from the grand
displays, called Illuminations, that it provided for rulers and sometimes for
greater lords. Lesser fireworks were sold for use by others, but with dire
warnings of the disaster that could result from attempting to learn what was
inside them. The Guild once had chapter houses in Cairhien and Tanchico, but
both are now destroyed. In addition, the members of the Guild in Tanchico
resisted the invasion by the Seanchan and the survivors were made <em>da&rsquo;covale</em>,
and the Guild as such no longer exists. However, individual Illuminators
have escaped Seanchan rule, and perhaps more grand displays will be seen in the
not-too-distant future. <em>See also da&rsquo;covale.</em></dd>

<dt><strong>Ishara:</strong></dt>

<dd>The first Queen of Andor (<em>circa</em> FY 994-1020).
At the death of Artur Hawkwing, Ishara convinced her husband, one of Hawkwing&rsquo;s
foremost generals, to raise the siege of Tar Valon and accompany her to Caemlyn
with as many soldiers as he could break away from the army. Where others tried
to seize the whole of Hawkwing&rsquo;s empire and failed, Ishara took a firm hold on
a small part and succeeded. Today, nearly every noble House in Andor contains
some of Ishara&rsquo;s blood, and the right to claim the Lion Throne depends both on
direct descent from her and on the number of lines of connection to her that
can be established.</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dt><strong>Kaensada:</strong></dt>

<dd>An area of Seanchan that is
populated by less-than-civilized hill tribes. These tribes fight a great deal
among themselves, as do individual families within the tribes. Each tribe has
its own customs and taboos, the latter of which often make no sense to anyone
outside that tribe. Most of the tribesmen avoid the more civilized residents of
Seanchan.</dd>

<dt><strong>Katar:</strong></dt>

<dd>A city in Arad Doman known
for its mines and forges. Katar is wealthy enough that its Lords occasionally
need reminding that they are part of Arad Doman.</dd>

<dt><strong>Kin, the:</strong></dt>

<dd>Even during the Trolloc
Wars, more than two thousand years ago (circa 1000&mdash;1350 AB), the White Tower
continued to maintain its standards, putting out women who failed to measure up.
One group of these women, fearing to return home in the midst of the wars, fled
to Barashta (near the present-day site of Ebou Dar), as far from the fighting
as was possible to go at that time. Calling themselves the Kin, and Kinswomen,
they kept in hiding and offered a safe haven for others who had been put out. In
time, their approaches to women told to leave the Tower led to contacts with
runaways, and while the exact reasons may never be known, the Kin began to
accept runaways, as well. They made great efforts to keep these girls from
learning anything about the Kin until they were sure that Aes Sedai would not
swoop down and retake them. After all, everyone knew that runaways were always
caught sooner or later, and the Kin knew that unless they held themselves
secret, they themselves would be punished severely.</dd>
<dd>Unknown to the Kin, Aes
Sedai in the Tower were aware of their existence almost from the very first,
but prosecution of the wars left no time for dealing with them. By the end of
the wars, the Tower realized that it might not be in their best interests to
snuff out the Kin. Prior to that time, a majority of runaways actually had
managed to escape, whatever the Towers propaganda, but once the Kin began
helping them, the Tower knew exactly where any runaway was heading, and they
began retaking nine out of ten. Since Kinswomen moved in and out of Barashta
(and later Ebou Dar) in an effort to hide their existence and their numbers,
never staying more than ten years lest someone notice that they did not age at
a normal speed, the Tower believed they were few, and they certainly were
keeping themselves low. In order to use the Kin as a trap for runaways, the
Tower decided to leave them alone, unlike any other similar group in history,
and to keep the very existence of the Kin a secret known only to full Aes
Sedai.</dd>
<dd>The Kin do not have laws, but rather rules (called the Rule) based in
part on the rules for novices and Accepted in the White Tower, and in part on
the necessity of maintaining secrecy. As might be expected given the origins of
the Kin, they maintain the Rule very firmly on all of their members.</dd>
<dd>Recent open contacts between Aes Sedai and Kinswomen, while known only to a handful of
sisters, have produced a number of shocks, including the facts that there are
twice as many Kinswomen as Aes Sedai and that some have lived more than a
hundred years longer than any Aes Sedai who has lived since before the Trolloc
Wars. The effect of these revelations, both on Aes Sedai and on Kinswomen, is
as yet a matter for speculation. <em>See also</em> Daughters of Silence, the,
Knitting Circle, the.</dd>

<dt><strong>Knitting Circle, the:</strong></dt>

<dd>The leaders
of the Kin. Since no member of the Kin has ever known how Aes Sedai arrange
their own hierarchy&mdash;knowledge passed on only when an Accepted has passed her
test for the shawl&mdash;they put no store in strength in the Power but give great
weight to age, with the older woman always standing above the younger The
Knitting Circle (a title chosen, like the Kin, because it is innocuous) thus
consists of the thirteen oldest Kinswomen resident in Ebou Dar, with the oldest
given the title of Eldest. By the rules, all will have to step down when it is
time for them to move on, but so long as they are resident in Ebou Dar, they
have supreme authority over the Kin, to a degree that any Amyrlin Seat would
envy. <em>See also</em> Kin, the.</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dt><strong>Lady of the Shadows:</strong></dt>

<dd>A Seanchan term for death.</dd>

<dt><strong>Lance-Captain:</strong></dt>

<dd>In most
lands, noblewomen do not personally lead their armsmen into battle under normal
circumstances. Instead, they hire a professional soldier, almost always a
commoner, who is responsible for both training and leading their armsmen.
Depending on the land, this man can be called a Lance-Captain, Sword-Captain,
Master of the Horse, or Master of the Lances. Rumors of closer relationships
than lady and servant often spring up, perhaps inevitably. Sometimes they are
true.</dd>

<dt><strong>Legion of the Dragon, the:</strong></dt>

<dd>A
large military formation, all infantry, giving allegiance to the Dragon Reborn,
trained by Davram Bashere along lines worked out by himself and Mat Cauthon,
lines which depart sharply from the usual employment of foot. While many men
simply walk in to volunteer, large numbers of the Legion are scooped up by
recruiting parties from the Black Tower, who first gather all of the men in an
area who are willing to follow the Dragon Reborn, and only after taking them
through gateways near Caemlyn winnow out those who can be taught to channel.
The remainder, by far the greater number, are sent to Bashere&rsquo;s training camps.</dd>

<dt><strong>length, units of:</strong></dt>

<dd>10 inches = 1 foot; 3 feet = 1 pace; 2 paces = 1 span; 1000 spans = 1 mile; 4
miles = 1 league.</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dt><strong><em>marath&rsquo;damane</em>:</strong></dt>

<dd>In the Old Tongue, &ldquo;those who must be leashed,&rdquo; and
also &ldquo;one who must be leashed.&rdquo; The term applied by the Seanchan to any woman
capable of channeling who has not been collared as a <em>damane.</em></dd>

<dt><strong>Master of the Lances:</strong></dt>

<dd><em>See</em> Lance-Captain.</dd>

<dt><strong>Master of the Horse:</strong></dt>

<dd><em>See</em> Lance-Captain.</dd>

<dt><strong><em>Mera&rsquo;din</em>:</strong></dt>

<dd>In the Old Tongue, &ldquo;the Brotherless.&rdquo; The name
adopted, as a society, by those Aiel who abandoned clan and sept and went to
the Shaido because they could not accept Rand al&rsquo;Thor, a wetlander, as the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>,
or because they refused to accept his revelations concerning the history
and origins of the Aiel. Deserting clan and sept for any reason is anathema
among the Aiel, therefore their own warrior societies among the Shaido were
unwilling to take them in, and they formed this society, the Brotherless.</dd>

<dt><strong><em>morat-</em>:</strong></dt>

<dd>In the Old
Tongue, &ldquo;handler.&rdquo; Among the Seanchan, it is used for those who handle exotics,
such as <em>morat&rsquo;raken</em>, a <em>raken</em> handler or rider, also informally
called a flier. <em>See also der&rsquo;morat-.</em></dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dt><strong>Prophet, the:</strong></dt>

<dd>More
formally, the Prophet of the Lord Dragon. Once known as Masema Dagar, a
Shienaran soldier, he underwent a revelation and decided that he had been
called to spread the word of the Dragon&rsquo;s Rebirth. He believes that nothing&mdash;nothing!&mdash;is more important than acknowledging the Dragon Reborn as the Light
made flesh and being ready when the Dragon Reborn calls, and he and his
followers will use any means to force others to sing the glories of the Dragon
Reborn. Forsaking any name but &ldquo;the Prophet,&rdquo; he has brought chaos to much of
Ghealdan and Amadicia, large parts of which he controls. He joined with Perrin
Aybara, who was sent to bring him to Rand, and has, for reasons unknown, stayed
with him even though this delays his going to the Dragon Reborn.</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dt><strong>Queen&rsquo;s Guards, the:</strong></dt>

<dd>The elite military formation in Andor. In peacetime the Guard is responsible for
upholding the Queen&rsquo;s law and keeping the peace. The uniform of the Queen&rsquo;s
Guard includes a red undercoat, gleaming mail and plate armor, a brilliant red
cloak, and a conical helmet with a barred visor. High-ranking officers wear
knots of rank on their shoulder, and may wear golden lion-head spurs. A recent
addition to the Queen&rsquo;s Guard is the Daughter-Heir&rsquo;s personal bodyguard, which
is composed entirely of women with the sole exception of its captain, Doilin
Mellar.</dd>

<dt><strong>Questioners, the:</strong></dt>

<dd>An order
within the Children of the Light. They refer to themselves as the Hand of the
Light, and their avowed purposes are to discover the truth in disputations and
uncover Darkfriends. In the search for truth and the Light, their normal method
of inquiry is torture, their normal manner that they know the truth already
and must only make their victim confess to it. At times they act as if they are
entirely separate from the Children and the Council of the Anointed, which
commands the Children. The head of the Questioners is the High Inquisitor, at
present Rhadam Asunawa, who sits on the Council of the Anointed. Their sign is
a blood-red shepherd&rsquo;s crook.</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dt><strong>Redarms:</strong></dt>

<dd>Soldiers of the Band of the
Red Hand, who have been chosen out for temporary police duty to make sure that
other soldiers of the Band cause no trouble or damage in a town or village. So
named because, while on duty, they wear very broad red armbands that almost
cover their entire sleeves. Usually chosen from among the most experienced and
reliable men. Since any damages must be paid for by the men serving as
Redarms, they work hard to make sure all is quiet and peaceful. A number of
former Redarms were chosen to accompany Mat Cauthon to Ebou Dar. <em>See also</em> Band
of the Red Hand.</dd>

<dt><strong>Return, the:</strong></dt>

<dd><em>See Corenne</em>.</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dt><strong>Sea Folk hierarchy:</strong></dt>

<dd>The
Atha&rsquo;an Miere, the Sea Folk, are ruled by the Mistress of the Ships to the
Atha&rsquo;an Miere. She is assisted by the Windfinder to the Mistress of the Ships,
and by the Master of the Blades. Below this come the clan Wavemistresses, each
assisted by her Windfinder and her Swordmaster. Below her are the
Sailmistresses (ship captains) of her clan, each assisted by her Windfinder and
her Cargomaster. The Windfinder to the Mistress of the Ships has authority over
all Windfinders to clan Wavemistresses, who in turn have authority over all the
Windfinders of her clan. Likewise, the Master of the Blades has authority over
all Swordmasters, and they in turn over the Cargomasters of their clans. Rank
is not hereditary among the Sea Folk. The Mistress of the Ships is chosen, for
life, by the First Twelve of the Atha&rsquo;an Miere, the twelve most senior clan
Wavemistresses. A clan Wavemistress is elected by the twelve most senior Sailmistresses
of her clan, called simply the First Twelve, a term which is also used to
designate the senior Sailmistresses present anywhere. She can also be removed
by a vote of her clan&rsquo;s First Twelve. In fact, anyone other than the Mistress
of the Ships can be demoted, even all the way down to deckhand, for
malfeasance, cowardice or other crimes. Also, the Windfinder to a Wavemistress
or Mistress of the Ship who dies will, of necessity, have to serve a lower
ranking woman, and her own rank thus decreases.</dd>

<dt><strong>Seandar:</strong></dt>

<dd>The Imperial capital of
Seanchan, located in the northeast of the Seanchan continent. It is also the
largest city in the Empire.</dd>

<dt><strong>Seekers:</strong></dt>

<dd>More formally, Seekers for
Truth, they are a police/spy organization of the Seanchan Imperial Throne.
Although most Seekers are <em>da&rsquo;covale</em> and the property of the Imperial
family, they have wide-ranging powers. Even one of the Blood can be arrested
for failure to answer any question put
by a Seeker, or for failure to cooperate fully with a Seeker, this last defined
by the Seekers themselves, subject only to review by the Empress. Those Seekers
who are <em>da&rsquo;covale</em> are marked on either shoulder with a raven and a
tower. Unlike the Deathwatch Guards, Seekers are seldom eager to show their
ravens, in part because it necessitates revealing who and what they are.</dd>

<dt><strong><em>sei&rsquo;mosiev</em>:</strong></dt>

<dd>In the Old Tongue, &ldquo;lowered eyes,&rdquo; or &ldquo;downcast eyes.&rdquo;
Among the Seanchan, to say that one has &ldquo;become <em>sei&rsquo;mosiev</em>&rdquo; means that
one has &ldquo;lost face.&rdquo; <em>See also sei&rsquo;taer.</em></dd>

<dt><strong><em>sei&rsquo;taer</em>:</strong></dt>

<dd>In the Old
Tongue, &ldquo;straight eyes,&rdquo; or &ldquo;level eyes.&rdquo; Among the Seanchan, it refers to
honor or face, to the ability to meet someone&rsquo;s eyes. It is possible to &ldquo;be&rdquo; or
&ldquo;have&rdquo; <em>sei&rsquo;taer</em>, meaning that one has honor and face, and also to &ldquo;gain&rdquo;
or &ldquo;lose&rdquo; <em>sei&rsquo;taer. See also sei&rsquo;mosiev.</em></dd>

<dt><strong>Shara:</strong></dt>

<dd>A mysterious land that lies
to the east of the Aiel Waste. The land is protected both by inhospitable
natural features and by man-made walls. Little is known about Shara, as the
people of that land appear to work to keep their culture secret. The Sharans
deny that the Trolloc Wars touched them, despite Aiel statements to the
contrary. They deny knowledge of Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s attempted invasion, despite
the accounts of eyewitnesses from the Sea Folk. The little information that has
leaked out reveals that the Sharans are ruled by a single absolute monarch, a
Sh&rsquo;boan if a woman and a Sh&rsquo;botay if a man. That monarch rules for exactly
seven years, then dies. The rule then passes to the mate of that ruler, who
rules for seven years and then dies. This pattern has repeated itself since the
time of the Breaking of the World. The Sharans believe that the deaths are the
&ldquo;Will of the Pattern.&rdquo;</dd>
<dd>There are channelers in Shara, known as the Ayyad, who
are tattooed on their faces at birth. The women of the Ayyad enforce the laws
regarding the Ayyad stringently. A sexual relationship between Ayyad and
non-Ayyad is punishable by death for the non-Ayyad, and the Ayyad is also
executed if force on his or her part can be proven. If a child is born of the
union, it is left exposed to the elements, and dies. Male Ayyad are used as
breeding stock only. When they reach their twenty-first year or begin to
channel, whichever comes first, they are killed by Ayyad women and the body
cremated. Supposedly, the Ayyad channel the One Power only at the command of
the Sh&rsquo;boan or Sh&rsquo;botay, who is always surrounded by Ayyad women.</dd>
<dd>Even the name of the land is in doubt. The natives
have been known to call it many different names, including Shamara, Co&rsquo;dansin,
Tomaka, Kigali, and Shibouya.</dd>

<dt><strong><em>Shen an Calhar</em>:</strong></dt>

<dd>In the Old
Tongue, &ldquo;the Band of the Red Hand.&rdquo;</dd>

<dd>(1) A legendary group of heroes who had
many exploits, finally dying in the defense of Manetheren when that land was
destroyed during the Trolloc Wars.</dd>

<dd>(2) A military formation put together almost
by accident by Mat Cauthon and organized along the lines of military forces
during what is considered the height of the military arts, the days of Artur
Hawkwing and the centuries immediately preceding. <em>See also</em> Redarms.</dd>

<dt><strong>Sisnera, Darlin:</strong></dt>

<dd>A High Lord in Tear, he was formerly in rebellion
against the Dragon Reborn, but now serves as Steward for the Dragon Reborn in
Tear.</dd>

<dt><strong><em>so&rsquo;jhin</em>:</strong></dt>

<dd>The closest translation from the Old Tongue would be
&ldquo;a height among lowness,&rdquo; though some translate it as meaning &ldquo;both sky and valley&rdquo;
among several other possibilities. <em>So&rsquo;jhin</em> is the term applied by the
Seanchan to hereditary upper servants They are <em>da&rsquo;covale</em>, property, yet
occupy positions of considerable authority and often power. Even the Blood step
carefully around <em>so&rsquo;jhin</em> of the Imperial family, and speak to <em>so&rsquo;jhin</em>
of the Empress herself as to equals. <em>See also</em> Blood, the, <em>da&rsquo;covale.</em></dd>

<dt><strong>Stump:</strong></dt>

<dd>A public meeting among the
Ogier. The meeting can be within or between <em>stedding.</em> It is presided over
by the Council of Elders of a <em>stedding</em>, but any adult Ogier may speak,
or may choose an advocate to speak for him. A Stump is often held at the largest
tree stump in a <em>stedding</em>, and may last for several years. When a
question arises that affects all Ogier, a Great Stump is held, and Ogier from
all <em>stedding</em> meet to address the question. The various <em>stedding</em> take
turns hosting a Great Stump.</dd>

<dt><strong>Sword-Captain:</strong></dt>

<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dt><strong>Taborwin, Breane:</strong></dt>

<dd>Once a
bored noblewoman in Cairhien, she lost her wealth and status and is now not
only a servant, but in a serious romantic relationship with a man whom she
once would have scorned.</dd>

<dt><strong>Taborwin, Dobraine:</strong></dt>

<dd>A lord
in Cairhien. He currently serves as Steward for the Dragon Reborn in Cairhien.</dd>

<dt><strong>Tarabon:</strong></dt>

<dd>A nation on the Aryth
Ocean. Once a great trading nation, a source of rugs, dyes and the Guild of
Illuminators&rsquo; fireworks among other things, Tarabon has fallen on hard times.
Racked by anarchy and civil war compounded by simultaneous wars against Arad
Doman and the Dragonsworn, it was ripe for the picking when the Seanchan
arrived. It is now firmly under Seanchan control, the chapter house of the
Guild of Illuminators has been destroyed and most Illuminators themselves made <em>da&rsquo;covale</em>.
Most Taraboners appear grateful that the Seanchan have restored order, and
since the Seanchan allow them to continue living their lives with minimal
interference, they have no desire to bring on more warfare by trying to chase
the Seanchan out. There are, however, some lords and soldiers who remain outside
the Seanchan sphere of influence and hope to reclaim their land.</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dt><strong>wasp-jelly:</strong></dt>

<dd>A small
aquatic creature that appears to be made of jelly but stings severely when
touched.</dd>

<dt><strong>weight, units of:</strong></dt>

<dd>10 ounces = 1 pound, 10 pounds = 1 stone, 10 stone = 1 hundredweight, 10
hundredweight = 1 ton.</dd>

<dt><strong>Wild Hunt, the:</strong></dt>

<dd>It is believed by many that the Dark One (often called Grim, or Old Grim, in Tear,
Illian, Murandy, Altara and Ghealdan) rides out in the night with the &ldquo;black
dogs,&rdquo; or the Darkhounds, hunting souls. This is the Wild Hunt. It is believed
by many that merely seeing the Wild Hunt pass means imminent death, either for
the viewer or for someone dear to the viewer. It is held to be especially
dangerous to meet the Wild Hunt at a crossroads, just before sunrise or just
after sunset. <em>See also</em> Darkhounds.</dd>

<dt><strong>Winged Guards, the:</strong></dt>

<dd>The personal bodyguards of the First of Mayene, and the elite military formation of
Mayene. Members of the Winged Guards wear red-painted breastplates and red
helmets shaped like rimmed pots that come down to the napes of their necks in
the back, and carry red-streamered lances. Officers have wings worked on the
sides of their helmets, and rank is denoted by slender plumes.</dd>

<dt><strong>Wise Woman:</strong></dt>

<dd>Honorific used in Ebou Dar for women famed for their incredible abilities at
healing almost any injury. A Wise Woman is traditionally marked by a red belt.
While some have noted that many, indeed most, Ebou Dar Wise Women were not even
from Altara, much less Ebou Dar, what was not known until recently, and still
is known only to a few, is that all Wise Women are in fact Kinswomen and use
various versions of Healing, giving out herbs and poultices only as a cover.
With the flight of the Kin from Ebou Dar after the Seanchan took the city, no
Wise Women remain there. <em>See also</em> Kin, the.</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dt><strong>Younglings, the:</strong></dt>

<dd>The first Younglings were young men studying under the Warders at the White Tower.
They fought against their teachers who attempted to free Siuan Sanche after she
was deposed from the Amyrlm Seat. Led by Gawyn Trakand, the Younglings remained
loyal to the White Tower, and fought skirmishes against Whitecloaks under Eamon
Valda. They accompanied Elaida&rsquo;s embassy to the Dragon Reborn in Cairhien and
saw action against the Aiel and Asha&rsquo;man at Dumai&rsquo;s Wells. On their return to
Tar Valon, they found themselves barred from the city.</dd>
<dd>The Younglings wear
green cloaks with Gawyn&rsquo;s White Boar, those who fought against their teachers
in Tar Valon wear a small silver tower on their collars. They accept recruits
wherever they go, but they do not take veterans or older men. One requirement
is that the recruit must be willing to put aside all loyalties except to the
Younglings. Older members teach the new recruits Warder techniques since they
have given over accepting instruction from Warders, and several have refused
offers of bonding from Aes Sedai. In many ways they hardly seem attached to the
Tower and Aes Sedai at all. This is a result in part of their suspicion that
they were not meant to survive the expedition to Cairhien.</dd>
