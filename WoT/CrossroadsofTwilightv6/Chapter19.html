<h4><em>Surprises</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">B</span>y custom, the Amyrlin was informed of the Hall
 sitting, yet nothing said they had to wait for her before starting the
 session, which meant that time might be short. Egwene wanted to leap to her
 feet and march straight to the big pavilion before Moria and the other two
 could spring whatever surprise they intended. Surprises in the Hall were
 seldom good. Surprises you learned about late were worse. Still, protocols
 that were law, not custom, had to be followed for the Amyrlin entering the
 Hall, so she remained where she was and sent Siuan to fetch Sheriam so she
 could be announced properly by the Keeper of the Chronicles. Siuan had told
 her that was really a matter of warning the Sitters of her presence&mdash;there
 were always matters they might want to discuss without the Amyrlin knowing&mdash; and she had not sounded entirely as if she were making a joke.</p>

<p>In any case, there was no point in going to the Hall
until she could enter. Tamping down her impatience, she propped her head on her
hands and massaged her temples as she tried to read a little more of the Ajah
reports. Despite the vile &ldquo;tea,&rdquo; or perhaps because of it, her headache made
the words shimmer on the page every time she blinked, and Anaiya and the other
two did not help.</p>

<p>No sooner did Siuan depart than Anaiya tossed back her
cloak, settling on the stool Siuan had vacated&mdash;it did not seem to lurch under
her, uneven legs or no&mdash;and began to speculate on what Moria and the others
were after. She was not a flighty woman, so her ventures were quite constrained
given the circumstances. Constrained, but no less upsetting for that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frightened people do silly things, Mother, even Aes
Sedai,&rdquo; she murmured, placing her hands on her knees, &ldquo;but at least you can be
sure Moria will be firm about Elaida, at least in the long run. She lays every
sister who died after Siuan was deposed right at Elaida&rsquo;s feet. Moria wants
Elaida birched for every single death before she goes to the headsman. A hard
woman, harder than Lelaine in some ways. Tougher, anyway. She won&rsquo;t scruple at
things that might make Lelaine balk. I&rsquo;m very much afraid she will press for an
assault on the city as soon as possible. If the Forsaken are moving so openly,
on such a scale, then better a wounded Tower that&rsquo;s whole than a Tower divided.
At least, I fear that&rsquo;s how Moria may see things. After all, however much we
want to avoid sisters killing sisters, it wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time. The Tower
has lasted a long time, and healed from many wounds. We can heal from this one,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anaiya&rsquo;s voice suited her face, warm and patient and
comforting, but making those remarks it seemed like fingernails screeching
down a slat. Light, for all Anaiya saying this was what she feared out of
Moria, she seemed much in accord with the sentiments. She was deliberate,
unflappable, and never careless with words. If she favored an assault, how many
others did, too?</p>

<p>As usual, Myrelle was anything but constrained. Mercurial and fiery
described her best. She would not know patience if it bit her on the nose. She
paced back and forth, as much as the confines of the tent allowed, kicking her
deep-green skirts and sometimes kicking one of the bright cushions piled
against the wall before turning to make another round. &ldquo;If Moria is frightened
enough to press for an assault, then she&rsquo;s frightened out of her wits. A Tower
too wounded to stand alone won&rsquo;t be able to face the Forsaken or anyone else.
Malind is who should concern you. She&rsquo;s always pointing out that Tarmon
Gai&rsquo;don could be upon us any day. I&rsquo;ve heard her say that what we felt could
well have been the opening blows of the Last Battle. And that it might happen
here, next. Where better for the Shadow to strike than Tar Valon? Malind has
never been afraid to make hard choices, or to retreat when she thought it necessary.
She would abandon Tar Valon <em>and</em> the Tower at once if she thought it
would preserve at least some of us for Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don. <em>She</em> will propose
lifting the siege, fleeing somewhere the Forsaken can&rsquo;t find us until we&rsquo;re
ready to strike back. If she puts the question to the Hall in the right way,
she might even get the greater consensus in support.&rdquo; The very thought made the
words dance harder on the page in front of Egwene.</p>

<p>Morvrin, her round face unrelenting, simply planted
fists on ample hips and met each suggestion with a curt answer. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know
enough yet to be sure it was the Forsaken,&rdquo; and &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t know until she
says.&rdquo; &ldquo;Perhaps it was, and perhaps not,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Supposition isn&rsquo;t evidence.&rdquo; It
was said she would not believe it was morning till she saw the sun for herself.
Her firm voice brooked no nonsense, especially jumps to conclusions. It was not
soothing to an aching head, either. She was not opposing the suggestions,
really, just keeping an open mind. An open mind could go either way when it
came down to the sticking point.</p>

<p>Egwene slapped the embossed folder shut on the reports with a loud
smack. Between the disgusting taste on her tongue and the sharp throb in her
head&mdash;not to mention their incessant voices!&mdash;she could not keep her place to
read anyway. The three sisters looked at her in surprise. She had made it clear
long ago that she was in charge, but she tried not to show temper. Oaths of
fealty or no oaths of fealty, a young woman displaying temper was too easy to
dismiss as sulky. Which only made her angrier, which made her head hurt more,
which&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve waited long enough,&rdquo; she said, making an effort
to keep her voice smooth. Her head gave it a slight edge of sharpness anyway.
Perhaps Sheriam thought she was supposed to meet her at the Hall.</p>

<p>Gathering her cloak, she strode out into the cold while still swinging
it around her shoulders, and Morvrin and the other two hesitated only a moment
before following in her wake. Accompanying her to the Hall might seem a little
like they were her entourage, but they <em>were</em> supposed to be watching her,
and she suspected that even Morvrin was eager to hear what Akarrin had to
report and what Moria and the rest intended to fashion from it.</p>

<p>Nothing too difficult to deal with, Egwene hoped, nothing like what
Anaiya and Myrelle thought. If necessary, she could try applying the Law of
War, but even if that was successful, ruling by edict had its disadvantages.
When people <em>had</em> to obey you in one thing, they always found ways to
wriggle away on others, and the more they were forced to obey, the more places
they found for wriggling away. It was a natural balance you could not escape.
Worse, she had learned just how addictive it was to have people jump when she
spoke. You came to take it as the natural way of things, and then when they
failed to jump, you were caught on the wrong foot. Besides, with her head
pounding&mdash;it <em>was</em> pounding, now, not throbbing, though perhaps not as
sharply&mdash;with her head, she was ready to snap at anyone who looked at her
crosswise, and even when people had to swallow it, that never went down well.</p>

<p>The sun stood straight overhead, a golden ball in a
blue sky with a scattering of white clouds, but it gave no warmth, only wan
shadows and a glitter to the snow wherever it remained untrampled. The air felt
as chill as it had by the river. Egwene ignored the cold, refused to let it
touch her, but only the dead could have been unaware, with everyone&rsquo;s breath
misting white in front of their faces. It was time for the midday meal, yet
there was no possibility of feeding so many novices at once, so Egwene and her
escort still moved through a wave of white-clad women leaping out of their way
and starting to curtsy in the street. She set such a pace that they were
usually past before the knots of novices could more than spread their skirts.</p>

<p>It was not a long way, with only four places that they needed to wade
across the muddy streets. There had been talk of wooden bridges, tall enough to
ride under, but bridges suggested a permanence to the camp that no one wanted.
Even the sisters who spoke of them never pressed to have them built. Which left
wading slowly, and taking care to keep your skirts and cloak high if you were
not to arrive filthy to your knees. At least the remaining crowds
vanished as they approached the Hall. That stood alone as always, or nearly so.</p>

<p>Nisao
and Carlinya were already waiting in front of the big canvas pavilion with its
patched side curtains, the tiny Yellow fretting her underlip with her teeth
and eyeing Egwene anxiously. Carlinya was calmness itself, cool-eyed, hands
folded at her waist. Except that she had forgotten her cloak, mud stained the
scroll-embroidered hem of her pale skirt, and her cap of dark curls badly
needed a comb. Making their courtesies, the pair joined Anaiya and the other
two, a little distance behind Egwene. The lot of them murmured softly, the
snatches that Egwene caught innocuous, about the weather, or how long they
might have to wait. This was no place for them to seem too closely associated
with her.</p>

<p>Beonin came
down the walk at a run, her hurried breath misting, and skidded to a halt,
staring at Egwene before joining the others. The strain around her blue-gray
eyes was even more apparent than earlier. Perhaps she thought this would
affect her negotiations. But she <em>knew</em> the talks would be a sham, just a
ploy to gain time. Egwene controlled her breathing and practiced novice exercises,
yet none of it helped her head. It never did.</p>

<p>There was no
sign of Sheriam among the tents in any direction, but they were not precisely
alone on the walkway outside the pavilion. Akarrin and the five other sisters
who had gone with her, one from each Ajah, were waiting in a cluster on the
other side of the entrance. Most offered curtsies to Egwene distractedly, yet
kept their distance. Perhaps they had been warned to say nothing to anyone
until they spoke before the Hall. Egwene could simply have demanded their
report on the spot, of course. They might even have given it, to the Amyrlin.
Likely they would have. On the other hand, an Amyrlin&rsquo;s relations with the
Ajahs were always delicate, often including the Ajah she had been raised from.
Nearly as delicate as relations with the Hall. Egwene made herself smile and
bow her head graciously. If she gritted her teeth behind that smile, well, that
helped keep her mouth shut.</p>

<p>Not all of
the sisters seemed aware of her presence. Akarrin, slender in plain brown wool
and a cloak with surprisingly elaborate green embroidery, was staring at
nothing, nodding to herself now and
then. Apparently she was practicing what she would say inside. Akarrin was not
strong in the Power, little more than Siuan if at all, but only one other of
the six, Therva, a slim woman in yellow-slashed riding skirts and a cloak edged
with yellow, stood even as high as she. That was a distressing measure of just
how frightened the sisters were by that strange beacon of <em>saidar.</em> The
strongest should have stepped forward for the task that had been given to
these, but except for Akarrin herself, zeal had been notably lacking. Her
companions still appeared less than enthusiastic. Shana normally maintained a
deep reserve despite eyes that made her appear constantly startled, but now
they seemed ready to come out of her head with worry. She peered at the
entrance to the Hall, closed off by heavy flaps, and her hands fiddled with her
cloak as if she could not keep them still. Reiko, a stout Arafellin Blue, kept
her eyes down, but the silver bells in her long dark hair chimed faintly as if
she were shaking her head inside her cowl. Only Therva&rsquo;s long-nosed face wore a
look of absolute serenity, completely unperturbed and unshakable, yet that in
itself was a bad sign. The Yellow sister was excitable by nature. What had they
seen? What <em>were</em> Moria and the other two Sitters after?</p>

<p>Egwene controlled her impatience; the Hall plainly was not sitting yet.
It was gathering, but several Sitters strolled past her and into the big pavilion,
none hurrying. Salita hesitated as if she might speak, but then only dipped her
knees before raising her yellow-fringed shawl onto her shoulders and sweeping
inside. Kwamesa peered down her sharp nose at Egwene while making her curtsy,
and peered down her nose while studying Anaiya and the others briefly, but
then, the slim Gray peered down her nose at everyone. She was not tall, but she
tried to seem so. Berana, face a mask of haughtiness and big brown eyes as cold
as the snow, paused to offer cool courtesies to Egwene and frown at Akarrin.
After a long moment, perhaps realizing that Akarrin did not even see her, she
smoothed her silver-embroidered white skirts, which did not need it, adjusted
her shawl along her arms so the white fringe hung just so, and glided through
the entry flaps as though she just happened to be going in that direction. All
three were among the Sitters Siuan had pointed out as too young. As were Malind
and Escaralde. But Moria had been Aes Sedai for a hundred and thirty years. Light,
Siuan had her looking for conspiracies in everything!</p>

<p>Just as Egwene began to think that her head would explode from
frustration if not from her headache, Sheriam suddenly appeared, hiking her
cloak and skirts while half-running across the dirty slush of the street. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
terribly sorry, Mother,&rdquo; she said breathlessly, channeling hurriedly to clean
off the mud she had splashed on herself. It fell to the walkway in a dry powder
when she twitched her skirts. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I heard that the Hall was sitting, and I
knew you would be looking for me, so I came as fast as I could. I&rsquo;m very
sorry.&rdquo; So Siuan was still searching for her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re here now,&rdquo; Egwene said firmly. The woman must
have been truly upset to offer apologies in front of the others, Akarrin and
her companions more than Anaiya and the rest. Even when people knew better,
they tended to take you for what you appeared to be, and the Keeper should not
be seen apologizing and wringing her hands. Surely she knew that. &ldquo;Go ahead and
announce me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drawing a deep breath, Sheriam pushed back the hood of
her cloak, adjusted her narrow blue stole, and stepped through the entry flaps.
Her voice rang out clearly in the ritual phrases. &ldquo;She comes, she comes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene barely waited for her to finish with &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the
Flame of Tar Valon, the Amyrlin Seat,&rdquo; before striding in through the ring of
braziers and stand-lamps that rimmed the pavilion&rsquo;s walls. The stand-lamps gave
a good light, and the braziers, giving off a scent of lavender today, warmed
the whole space. No one wished to have to ignore the cold when she could feel
real warmth.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the pavilion followed ancient
rules, modified only slightly to allow for the fact that they were not meeting
in the White Tower, in the great circular chamber called the Hall of the Tower.
At the far end, a simple if well polished bench stood atop a box-like platform
covered with cloth striped in the seven colors of the Ajahs. That and the stole
around Egwene&rsquo;s neck were surely the only places in the camp where the Red Ajah
had any representation. Some Blues had wanted the color removed, since Elaida
apparently had had the actual throne called the Amyrlin Seat repainted and a
stole woven without blue, but Egwene had dug in her heels. If she was to be of
all Ajahs and none, then she would be of <em>all</em> Ajahs. Down the bright
layered carpets that served as a ground-cloth, two lines of benches slanted
away from the entrance in groups of three, sitting atop cloth-covered boxes in
the colors of the Ajahs. Well, six of the Ajahs. By tradition, the two oldest
Sitters could claim the places closest to the Amyrlin Seat for their Ajahs, so
Yellow and Blue held those spots here. After that, it was a matter of who came
first and wished to be seated where, the first arrival always choosing her
Ajah&rsquo;s place.</p>

<p>There were only nine Sitters present, too few for the
Hall to be sitting yet, legally speaking, but an oddity in the seating struck
Egwene right away. Unsurprisingly, Romanda was already in place, an empty bench
between her and Salita, and Lelaine and Moria occupied the end benches of the
Blue. Romanda, her hair in a tight gray bun on the nape of her neck, was the
oldest Sitter, and almost always the first to reach her place when the Hall
sat. Lelaine, next oldest despite her dark glossy hair, seemed unable to let
the other woman gain a jump on her even in something so small. The men who had
shifted the boxes&mdash;they were stored along the walls until the Hall was called
to sit&mdash;must have just left through the back, because Kwamesa, already seated
on her bench, was the only Gray Sitter in evidence, and Berana, just climbing
to hers, the only White. But Malind, a round-faced Kandori with an eagle&rsquo;s
eyes, and the lone Green, obviously had entered ahead of them, yet strangely,
she had chosen to seat the Greens near the pavilion&rsquo;s entrance. The nearer the
Amyrlin Seat the better, was the usual thing. And directly opposite her,
Escaralde stood in front of the brown-covered boxes, in hushed argument with
Takima. Almost as short as Nisao, Takima was a quiet bird-like woman, but she
could be forceful when she wished, and with her fists on her hips she looked a
sparrow in a temper, feathers all puffed out to make her seem larger. By the
way she kept darting sharp looks toward Berana, the seating was what upset her.
It was too late for anything to be changed for this sitting, of course, but in
any case, Escaralde loomed back at Takima as if she expected to have to fight
for her choice. It amazed Egwene how Escaralde could do that. Loom, that was. She
stood inches shorter even than Nisao. It must have been sheer force of will.
Escaralde never backed down when she thought she was in the right. And she
always did think she was in the right. If Moria really did want an immediate
assault on Tar Valon, and Malind really wanted to retreat, what did Escaralde
want?</p>

<p>For all Siuan&rsquo;s talk of Sitters wanting to be warned, Egwene&rsquo;s entrance
caused no great stir. For whatever reasons Malind and the others had called the
Hall to hear Akarrin&rsquo;s report, they had not considered the matter so sensitive
that it needed to be held for Sitters&rsquo; ears alone, so little clusters of four
or five Aes Sedai were standing behind the benches of their Ajah&rsquo;s Sitters, and
they made their curtsies as Egwene walked down the carpets toward her own seat.
The Sitters themselves merely watched her, or perhaps inclined a head briefly.
Lelaine eyed her coolly, then returned to frowning faintly at Moria, a quite
ordinary-appearing woman in plain blue wool. So ordinary, in fact, that you
could miss the ageless quality in her face at first glance. She sat staring
straight ahead, absorbed in her own thoughts. Romanda was one of those to tilt
her head a fraction. Inside the Hall, the Amyrlin Seat was still the Amyrlin
Seat, but a little less so than outside it. Inside the Hall, Sitters felt their
power. In a way, the Amyrlin could be said to be only the first among equals,
inside the Hall. Well, perhaps a little more than that, but not by much. Siuan
said as many Amyrlins had failed by believing the Sitters were fully her equals
as by believing the difference was wider than really existed. It was like
running along the top of a narrow wall with fierce mastiffs on either side. You
maintained a careful balance and tried to watch your feet more than the dogs.
But you were always aware of the dogs.</p>

<p>Unpinning her cloak as she stepped up onto the striped
box, Egwene folded it across her bench before sitting. The benches were hard,
and some Sitters brought cushions when they thought the sitting would be long.
Egwene preferred not to. The prohibition on speeches seldom stopped at least
one or two women from drawing their comments out at length, and a hard seat
could help you remain awake through the worst. Sheriam took the Keeper&rsquo;s place
standing to Egwene&rsquo;s left, and there was nothing to do but wait. Maybe she <em>should</em>
have brought a cushion.</p>

<p>The other benches were beginning to fill, though
slowly. Aledrin and Saroiya had joined Berana, Aledrin plump enough to make the
other two appear slim. Of course, the vertical lines of white scrollwork
running down Saroiya&rsquo;s skirts had that effect anyway, while Aledrin&rsquo;s wide
white sleeves and the snowy panel running down the front of her dress did just
the opposite. Each apparently was trying to find out whether the others knew
what was afoot, from the way they were shaking their heads at each other and
shooting glances toward the Blues, the Browns and the Greens. Varilin, a
red-haired stork of a woman and taller than most men, had taken her seat beside
Kwamesa, too. Adjusting and readjusting her shawl restlessly, Varilin darted
her eyes from Moria to Escaralde to Malind and back. Magla, yellow-fringed
shawl wrapped tightly around her broad shoulders, and Faiselle, a square-faced
Domani in silks covered with dense green embroidery, were just entering the
pavilion, each ignoring the other even when their skirts brushed. Magla was
firmly in Romanda&rsquo;s camp and Faiselle in Lelaine&rsquo;s, and the two groups did not
mix. Other sisters were trickling in by spurts, as well, Nisao and Myrelle
among half a dozen or so who slipped in behind Magla and Faiselle. Morvrin was
already among the Browns behind Takima and Escaralde, and Beonin stood on the
edge of the Grays behind Varilin and Kwamesa. At this rate, half the Aes Sedai
in the camp would be crowded into the pavilion before long.</p>

<p>While Magla was still walking down the carpets toward the Yellow seats,
Romanda rose to her feet. &ldquo;We are more than eleven now, so we may as well
begin.&rdquo; Her voice was surprisingly high-pitched. You might have thought she had
a beautiful singing voice, if you could imagine Romanda singing. Her face
always seemed more set for scolding, at least slightly disapproving. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
think we need make this a formal session,&rdquo; she added when Kwamesa stood. &ldquo;I
hardly see why this need be done in session at all, but if it must, let us get
it over and out of the way. Some of us have more important matters to deal
with. As I&rsquo;m sure you do, Mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That last was said with a deep bow of her head, in a tone perhaps a
hair <em>too</em> respectful. Not far enough over the line to be called sarcasm,
of course. She was too intelligent to place herself in jeopardy; fools seldom
attained a Sitter&rsquo;s chair, or held it long, and Romanda had held a seat in the
Hall for almost eighty years. This was her second time as a Sitter. Egwene
inclined her own head slightly, eyes cool. An acknowledgment that she had been
addressed and that she had marked the tone. A very careful balance.</p>

<p>Kwamesa was left looking around with her mouth open, uncertain whether
she was to speak the phrases, always uttered by the youngest Sitter present,
that opened a formal sitting of the Hall. Romanda&rsquo;s place gave her considerable
influence and some measure of authority, yet others could override her in this.
A number of Sitters frowned or shifted on their benches, but no one spoke.</p>

<p>Lyrelle glided into the pavilion, glided toward the Blue benches. Tall
for a Cairhienin woman, which made her of average height for almost anywhere
else, she was elegant in blue-slashed silk embroidered on the bodice with red
and gold, her movements flowing. Some said she had been a dancer before coming
to the Tower as a novice. By comparison, Samalin, the fox-faced Green who
entered on her heels, seemed to stride mannishly, though there was nothing at
all awkward about the Murandian woman. They both seemed surprised to see
Kwamesa on her feet, and hurried to their respective benches. In any case,
Varilin began plucking at Kwamesa&rsquo;s sleeve, until the Arafellin woman finally
sat down. Kwamesa&rsquo;s face was a mask of cool calmness, yet she managed to
radiate displeasure. She put a great store in ceremony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps there <em>is</em> reason for formal session.&rdquo; Lelaine&rsquo;s voice
seemed low, after Romanda&rsquo;s. Arranging her shawl as though she had all the time
in the world, she rose gracefully, very deliberately not looking at Egwene. A
beautiful woman, Lelaine still was dignity incarnate. &ldquo;It seems that talks
with Elaida have been licensed,&rdquo; she said coolly. &ldquo;I do understand that under
the Law of War, we need not be consulted on this, but I also believe we should
discuss it in session, especially since many of us face the possibility of
being stilled if Elaida retains any power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That word, &ldquo;stilled,&rdquo; no longer carried quite the
chill it had before Siuan and Leane were Healed from stilling, but murmurs rose
among the watching Aes Sedai crowded behind the benches. It seemed that news of
negotiations had not spread as quickly as Egwene expected. She could not tell
whether the sisters were excited or dismayed, but clearly they were surprised.
Including some of the Sitters. Janya, who had entered while Lelaine was
speaking, stopped dead in her tracks, so that another knot of sisters coming in
nearly walked into her. She stared at the Blue, then longer and harder at Egwene
herself. Romanda plainly had not heard either, from the way her mouth hardened,
and expressions among the too-young Sitters ranged from Berana&rsquo;s icy calm to
amazed on Samalin&rsquo;s part and openly appalled on Salita&rsquo;s. For that matter,
Sheriam swayed on her feet for a moment. Egwene hoped the woman would not sick
up in front of the entire Hall.</p>

<p>More interesting, though, were the reactions of those
Delana had reported as speaking of negotiation. Varilin sat very still and
seemed to be suppressing a smile as she studied her skirts, but Magla licked
her lips hesitantly and cast glances at Romanda from the corner of her eye.
Saroiya had her eyes closed, and her mouth moved as though she might be
uttering a prayer. Faiselle and Takima gazed at Egwene wearing almost identical
tiny frowns. Then each noticed the other and gave a start, quickly assuming
such regal serenity that they seemed to be mocking one another. It was very
strange. Surely by now Beonin had informed all of them what Egwene had said,
yet except for Varilin, they seemed upset. They could not possibly have thought
they might really negotiate an end. Every woman sitting in this Hall risked
stilling and execution just by being there. If there ever had been any path
back except to remove Elaida, it had washed away months ago, when this Hall was
chosen. There <em>was</em> no going back from that.</p>

<p>Lelaine appeared satisfied with the reactions to her words&mdash;smug as a
cat in the milkbarn, in fact&mdash;but before she finished settling back onto her
bench, Moria bounded to her feet. That caught every eye and caused a few more
murmurs. No one called Moria particularly graceful, but the Illianer was not a
woman who bounded. &ldquo;That do need discussion,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but it must come
later. This Hall did be called by three Sitters asking the same question. That
question must be addressed before any other. What did Akarrin and her party
find? I do ask they be brought in to make their report before the Hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lelaine scowled at her fellow Blue, and she could
scowl with the best, her eyes as sharp as awls, yet Tower law was quite plain
on the subject, for once, and well known to everyone. Often enough, it was
neither. In an unsteady voice, Sheriam asked Aledrin, the youngest after
Kwamesa, to go and escort Akarrin and the others before the Hall. Egwene
decided she had best talk to the fire-haired woman as soon as this sitting was
done. If Sheriam kept on this way, she would soon become worse than useless as
Keeper.</p>

<p>Delana darted into the pavilion amid a cluster of sisters, the last
Sitter to arrive, and was on her bench draping her shawl across her elbows by
the time the plump White Sitter returned with the six sisters and led them to
stand before Egwene. They must have left their cloaks on the walkway outside,
because none was wearing one now. Delana peered at them, an uncertain frown
drawing her eyebrows down. She seemed out of breath, as though she had run to
get there.</p>

<p>Apparently, Aledrin felt that whether or not the sitting was formal,
she, at least, should carry on with proper formality. &ldquo;You have been called
before the Hall of the Tower to relate what you have seen,&rdquo; she said in a
strong Taraboner accent. Her combination of dark golden hair and brown eyes was
not unusual in Tarabon, though she wore her shoulder-length hair caught in a
lacy white net rather than in beaded braids. &ldquo;I charge you to speak of these
things without the evasion or holding back, and to answer all questions in
complete fullness, leaving out nothing. Say now that you will do so, under the
Light and by your hope of the rebirth and salvation, or suffer the
consequences.&rdquo; Those ancient sisters who made this part of the Hall&rsquo;s ceremony
had been well aware of how much leeway the Three Oaths gave. A little left out
here, a touch of vagueness there, and the whole meaning of what you said could
be stood on its head, all while you spoke only the truth.</p>

<p>Akarrin spoke the assurance loudly and somewhat
impatiently, the other five with varying levels of formality and
self-consciousness. Many sisters had lived their entire lives without being
called to testify in front of the Hall. Aledrin waited until the last had
repeated every word before marching back toward her bench.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell us what you did see, Akarrin,&rdquo; Moria said as
soon as the White Sitter turned away. Aledrin stiffened visibly, and when she
took her seat, her face was utterly expressionless, but bright spots of color
highlighted her cheeks. Moria should have waited. She must have been very
anxious.</p>

<p>By tradition&mdash;there were many more traditions and
customs than laws, and the Light knew there were more laws than anyone really
knew, often contradictory layers of law laid down over the centuries, but
tradition and custom ruled Aes Sedai as much as Tower law ever had, perhaps
more so&mdash;by tradition, Akarrin addressed her response to the Amyrlin Seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What we saw, Mother, was a roughly circular hole in
the ground,&rdquo; she said, nodding for emphasis at nearly every other word. She
seemed to choose those words carefully, as if to make sure she was absolutely
clear to everyone. &ldquo;It may have been a precise circle, originally, shaped like
half of a ball, but the sides have collapsed in some places. The hole is
approximately three miles across and perhaps a mile and a half deep.&rdquo; Someone
gasped loudly, and Akarrin frowned as though whoever it was had tried to interrupt.
She went on without pausing, however. &ldquo;We could not be entirely certain of the
depth. The bottom is covered with water and ice. We believe it may become a
lake, eventually. In any event, we were able to ascertain our exact location
without too much difficulty, and we are prepared to say that the hole is
located where the city called Shadar Logoth once stood.&rdquo; She fell silent, and
for a long moment the only sound was the rustle of skirts as Aes Sedai shifted
uneasily.</p>

<p>Egwene wanted to shift, too. Light, a hole that size would cover half of
Tar Valon! &ldquo;Do you have any idea how this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;hole&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;was created,
Akarrin?&rdquo; she asked finally. She was quite proud of how steady her voice was.
Sheriam was actually trembling! Egwene hoped no one else noticed. A Keeper&rsquo;s
actions always reflected on the Amyrlin. If the Keeper showed fear, a good many
sisters would think that Egwene was afraid. That was hardly something she
wanted anyone to suspect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Each of us was chosen because we have some ability at
reading residues, Mother. Better than most, in truth.&rdquo; So they had <em>not</em> been
chosen simply because no one stronger was interested. There was a lesson in
that. What Aes Sedai did was seldom as simple as it appeared on the surface.
Egwene wished she could stop having to relearn lessons she had thought already
learned. &ldquo;Nisain is the best of us at that,&rdquo; Akarrin went on. &ldquo;With your
permission, Mother, I will let her answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nisain
smoothed her dark woolen skirts nervously and cleared her throat. A gangly Gray
with a strong chin and startlingly blue eyes, she had some small repute in
matters of law and treaties, but she was obviously uneasy about speaking before
the Hall. She looked straight at Egwene with the air of someone who did not want
to actually see all the Sitters assembled. &ldquo;Given the amount of <em>saidar</em> used
there, Mother, it was no surprise to find the residues near as thick as the
snow.&rdquo; More than a hint of Murandy clung to her tongue, a lilting sound. &ldquo;Even
after so long, I should have been able to grasp some idea of what was woven, if
it was at all like anything I&rsquo;m familiar with, but I have none. I could all but
trace the weave, Mother, and it made no sense at all. None. In fact, it seemed
so alien, it might not have been&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Clearing her throat again, she
swallowed. Her face grew a little paler. &ldquo;It might not have been woven by a
woman. We thought it must have been the Forsaken, of course, so I tested for
resonance. We all did.&rdquo; Half-turning to gesture to her companions, she
hurriedly turned back. She definitely preferred looking at Egwene to the
Sitters, all leaning forward intently. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say what was done, beyond
scooping three miles out of the earth, or how it was done, but <em>saidin</em> was
definitely used, too. The resonance was so strong, we should have been able to
smell it. There was more <em>saidin</em> used than <em>saidar</em>, much more,
Dragonmount beside a foothill. And that is all I can say, Mother.&rdquo; A sound
fluttered through the pavilion, the sound of sisters letting out the breath
they had been holding. Sheriam&rsquo;s exhalation seemed the loudest, but perhaps
that was just because she was nearest.</p>

<p>Egwene
schooled her face to stillness. The Forsaken, and a weave that could tear away
half of Tar Valon. If Malind did propose flight, could she try to make the
sisters remain and face that? Could she abandon Tar Valon, and the Tower, and
the Light knew how many tens of thousands of lives? &ldquo;Does anyone else have a
question?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I
have one,&rdquo; Romanda said in a dry tone. <em>Her</em> calm had not cracked by a
hair. &ldquo;But not for these sisters. If no one has any further questions for
them, I&rsquo;m sure they would like to be away from having the Hall stare at them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not precisely her place to suggest that, but
neither was it precisely not, so Egwene let it pass. No one else had questions
for Akarrin or her companions, as it turned out, and Romanda offered them
surprisingly warm thanks for their efforts. Again, not precisely her place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is your question for?&rdquo; Egwene asked as Akarrin and the other five
scattered to join the growing numbers of sisters crowding among the
stand-lamps and braziers. They were eager, as Romanda had said, to get out from
under the Hall&rsquo;s eyes, but they did want to hear what came of their work. It
was very difficult for Egwene to keep asperity out of her voice. Romanda
affected not to notice. Or perhaps did not notice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For Moria,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We suspected the Forsaken from the start. We
knew that whatever happened was powerful, and far away. All we&rsquo;ve learned,
really, is that Shadar Logoth is gone, and of that I can only say, the world is
better off without that sinkhole of the Shadow.&rdquo; She fixed the Blue Sitter with
a frown that had made many an Aes Sedai squirm like a novice. &ldquo;My question is
this. Has anything changed for us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It should,&rdquo; Moria replied, meeting the other woman&rsquo;s
stare levelly. She might not have been in the Hall as long as Romanda, but
Sitters were at least supposedly on an equal footing. &ldquo;We have long had
preparations in case the Forsaken do come against us. Every sister does know to
form a circle if she be able, or join one she does find forming, until every
circle does reach thirteen. Everyone is to be brought in, even the novices,
even the newest.&rdquo; Lelaine looked up at her sharply, but however much she wanted
to chide Moria, they were of the same Ajah. They must give at least the
appearance of a common front. The effort of keeping her mouth shut thinned
Lelaine&rsquo;s lips, though.</p>

<p>Romanda was under no such constraint. &ldquo;Must you explain what everyone here
already knows? We are the ones who <em>made</em> those arrangements. Perhaps you
have forgotten?&rdquo; This time, her voice was cutting. Open displays of anger were
forbidden in the Hall, but not goading.</p>

<p>If Moria felt the prick, though, she gave no outward sign beyond
adjusting her shawl. &ldquo;I must explain from the beginning, because we have no
thought far enough. Malind, can our circles stand against what Akarrin and
Nisain described?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite her fierce eyes, Malind&rsquo;s full mouth always
looked ready to smile, but she was quite stern as she stood, and she stared at
each Sitter in turn as if to impress her words on them. &ldquo;They cannot. Even if
we rearrange matters so the strongest sisters are always in the same circle&mdash;and that means they must live, eat and sleep together, if they&rsquo;re to link on
the moment&mdash;even then, we would be mice facing a cat. Enough mice can
overwhelm even a large hungry cat, but not before many mice are dead. If enough
of these mice die, though, the White Tower dies.&rdquo; Again that ripple of sighs ran
though the pavilion like an unsteady breeze.</p>

<p>Egwene managed to keep her face calm, but she had to
force her fists to relax their grip on her skirt. Which would they propose, an
assault or flight? Light, how <em>could</em> she oppose them?</p>

<p>Same Ajah or not, Lelaine could take the strain no
longer. &ldquo;What are you suggesting, Moria?&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;Even if we reunite the
Tower this very day, that won&rsquo;t change the facts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moria smiled slightly, as if the other Blue had said
just what she was hoping someone would say. &ldquo;But we must change the facts. The
fact at present do be that our strongest circles be too weak. We do have no <em>angreal</em>,
much less <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>, so we might as well ignore them. I&rsquo;m no
certain there be anything even in the Tower that would make a large enough difference,
anyway. How, then, do we make our circles stronger? Strong enough, we must
hope, to face what happened at Shadar Logoth and stop it. Escaralde, what have
you to say on the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Startled, Egwene leaned forward. They <em>were</em> working
together. But to what end?</p>

<p>She was not the only one to realize that the three Sitters who had
called the Hall were all on their feet. By remaining standing, Moria and Malind
had made a clear declaration. Escaralde stood like a queen, yet the tiny Brown
seemed all too aware of the eyes sliding between her and Malind and Moria, the
thoughtful frowns and too-still faces. She shifted her shawl twice before
speaking. She sounded as though she were lecturing a class, her voice thin yet
forceful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ancient literature is quite
clear, though little studied, I fear. It gathers dust rather than readers.
Writings collected in the earliest years of the Tower make it plain that
circles were not limited to thirteen, in the Age of Legends. The precise
mechanism&mdash;I should say, the precise balance&mdash;is unknown, but it should not
be too difficult to work out. For those of you who have not spent the time you
should have in the Tower library, the <em>manner</em> of increasing the size of a
circle involves&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; For the first time, she faltered, and visibly forced
herself to continue. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;involves the inclusion of men who can channel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faiselle popped to her feet. &ldquo;What are you
suggesting?&rdquo; she demanded and sat down immediately, as though someone might
think she was standing in support.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do ask that the Hall be cleared!&rdquo; Magla said,
rising. Like Moria, she was Illianer, and agitation thickened her accent
markedly. &ldquo;This do no be a matter for discussion before any save the Hall in
closed sitting.&rdquo; She, too, dropped back onto her bench as soon as she finished,
and sat glowering, wide shoulders hunched and hands opening and closing on her
skirts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do fear it be too late for that,&rdquo; Moria said loudly. She had to speak
loudly, to be heard over the murmur of sisters talking excitedly behind the benches,
a hum like a huge beehive. &ldquo;What has been said has been said, and heard by too
many sisters for anyone to try shutting the words away now.&rdquo; Her bosom rose as
she pulled in a deep breath, and she raised her voice a notch louder. &ldquo;I do put
before the Hall the proposal that we do enter into an agreement with the Black
Tower, that we may bring men into our circles at need.&rdquo; If she sounded a trifle
strangled at the end, it was no wonder. Few Aes Sedai could say that name
without emotion, disgust if not outright hatred. It struck against the buzz of
voices&mdash;and produced absolute silence for the space of three heartbeats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is madness!&rdquo; Sheriam&rsquo;s shriek shattered the stillness in more ways
than one. The Keeper did not enter discussions in the Hall. She could not even
enter the Hall itself without the Amyrlin. Face flooding with red, Sheriam drew
herself up, perhaps to face the inevitable rebuke, perhaps to defend herself.
The Hall had other things on its mind than rebuking her, though.</p>

<p>Leaping up from their benches just long enough to get their words out,
Sitters began to speak, to shout, sometimes on top of one another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madness hardly begins to describe it!&rdquo; Faiselle shouted, at the same
time that Varilin cried, &ldquo;How can we <em>ally</em> ourselves with men who can
channel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These so-called Asha&rsquo;man are tainted!&rdquo; Saroiya called
out with no sign of the vaunted White Ajah reserve. Hands knotted in her shawl,
she trembled so hard that the long snowy fringe swayed. &ldquo;Tainted with the Dark
One&rsquo;s touch!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even suggesting such a thing puts us against all the
White Tower stands for,&rdquo; Takima said roughly. &ldquo;We would be despised by every
woman who calls herself Aes Sedai, by Aes Sedai long in their graves!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Magla went so far as to shake a fist, with a fury she
did not attempt to mask. &ldquo;Only a Darkfriend could suggest this! Only a
Darkfriend!&rdquo; Moria paled at the accusation, then went bright red with anger of
her own.</p>

<p>Egwene did not know where she stood on this. The Black Tower was Rand&rsquo;s
creation, and perhaps necessary, if there was to be any hope of winning the
Last Battle, yet the Asha&rsquo;man <em>were</em> men who could channel, a thing feared
for three thousand years, and they channeled Shadow-stained <em>saidin.</em> Rand
himself was a man who could channel, yet without him, the Shadow would win at
Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don. The Light help her for seeing it so coldly, but it was hard
truth. Wherever she stood on the matter, matters were getting out of hand there
and then. Escaralde was exchanging insults with Faiselle, both at the tops of
their lungs. Open insults! In the Hall! Saroiya had abandoned the last shreds
of White Ajah coolness and was screaming at Malind, who screamed back, neither
waiting on the other. It would have been a wonder if either could understand
what the other was saying, and perhaps a blessing if they could not.
Surprisingly, neither Romanda nor Lelaine had opened her mouth since the
beginning. They sat staring at one another, unblinking. Likely each was trying
to read how the other would stand just so she could stand in opposition. Magla
got down from her bench and stalked toward Moria with the glare of someone
eager to come to blows. Not words, but fists. Magla&rsquo;s were clenched at her
sides. Her vine-worked shawl slid off onto the carpets, unnoticed.</p>

<p>Standing, Egwene embraced the Source. Except for certain exactly
prescribed functions, channeling was forbidden in the Hall&mdash;another of the
customs that pointed to darker days in the Hall&rsquo;s history&mdash;but she made a
simple weave of Air and Fire. &ldquo;A proposal has been laid before the Hall,&rdquo; she
said, and released <em>saidar.</em> That was not as hard as it once had been. Not
easy, not close to easy, but not as hard. A memory of the Power&rsquo;s sweetness
remained, enough to sustain her until the next time.</p>

<p>Magnified by the weave, her words boomed in the
pavilion like thunder. Aes Sedai shrank back, wincing and covering their ears.
The silence after seemed incredibly loud. Magla gaped at her in astonishment,
then gave a start at realizing that she was standing halfway to the Blue
benches. Hastily unloosing her fists, she paused to snatch up her shawl and
hurried back to her own seat. Sheriam stood weeping openly. Surely it had not
been that loud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A proposal has been laid before the Hall,&rdquo; Egwene repeated into the
silence. After that Power-magnified blare, her voice rang in her own ears.
Perhaps it <em>had</em> been louder than she thought. That weave had never been
intended for use inside walls, even patched canvas walls. &ldquo;How speak you in
support of an alliance with the Black Tower, Moria?&rdquo; She sat down as soon as
she finished. How <em>did</em> she stand on this? What difficulties would it
present her? How could it be used to advantage? The Light help her, indeed.
Those were the first two things to come to mind. She wished Sheriam would dry
her eyes and straighten her backbone. She was the Amyrlin Seat, and she needed
a Keeper, not a milksop.</p>

<p>It took a few minutes for order to restore itself, Sitters straightening
clothes and smoothing skirts unnecessarily, avoiding each other&rsquo;s eyes and
especially not looking at the watching sisters crowded behind the benches. Some
Sitter&rsquo;s faces became stained with red that had nothing to do with anger.
Sitters did not shriek at one another like farmhands at shearing. <em>Most</em> especially
not in front of other sisters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do be faced with two seemingly insurmountable difficulties,&rdquo; Moria
said finally. Her voice was composed and cool once more, but a hint of flush
still hung in her cheeks. &ldquo;The Forsaken have discovered a weapon&mdash;discovered
or uncovered; they surely would have used it before now, had they possessed it&mdash;a weapon we can no counter. A weapon we can no match, though the Light do
know why we would wish to, but most importantly, a weapon we can neither
survive nor stop. At the same time, the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Asha&rsquo;man&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;have grown like
weeds. Reliable reports do put their numbers at nearly equal to all the Aes
Sedai living. Even if that number do be inflated, we can no afford to believe
it exaggerated far. And more men come every day. The eyes-and-ears do be too
consistent to believe anything else. We should take these men and gentle them,
of course, but we have ignored them because of the Dragon Reborn. We have put
them off, to be dealt with later. The bitter truth do be that it be too late to
try taking them. They do be too many. Maybe it did be too late when we did
first learned what they were doing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we can no gentle these men, then we must control
them somehow. An agreement with the Black Tower&mdash;<em>alliance</em> be too strong
a word&mdash;with a carefully worded agreement, we can take the first steps toward
protecting the world from them. We also can bring them into our circles.&rdquo;
Raising a cautionary finger, Moria ran her gaze along the benches, but her
voice remained cool and composed. And firm. &ldquo;We must make it clear that a
sister will always meld the flows&mdash;I do <em>not</em> suggest letting a man
control a linked circle!&mdash;but with men in the circles, we can expand them.
With the blessings of the Light, perhaps we can expand the circles far enough
to counter this weapon of the Forsaken. We do kill two hares with one stone.
But these hares do be lions, and if we do no cast that stone, one of them will
surely kill us. It is as simple as that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silence fell. Excepting Sheriam, at least. Standing hunched in on
herself a few feet from Egwene, shoulders shaking, she still had not mastered
her weeping.</p>

<p>Then Romanda sighed heavily. &ldquo;Perhaps we can expand the circles enough
to counter the Forsaken,&rdquo; she said in a quiet voice. In a way, that gave her
words more weight than if she had shouted. &ldquo;Perhaps we can control the
Asha&rsquo;man. A thin word, perhaps, in either context.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you do be drowning,&rdquo; Moria replied, equally quiet, &ldquo;you do grab at
whatever branch floats by, even when you can no be sure it will support your
weight until you have hold. The water has no closed over our heads yet,
Romanda, but we be drowning. We do be drowning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again there was silence, but for Sheriam&rsquo;s sniveling.
Had she forgotten all self-control? But then, no one among the Sitters wore a
pleasant expression, not even Moria or Malind or Escaralde. It was not a
pleasant prospect that lay in front of them. Delana&rsquo;s face had turned decidedly
greenish. She looked as if she might be the one to sick up rather than Sheriam.</p>

<p>Egwene stood once more, long enough to ask the
required question. Even when the unthinkable was proposed, the rituals must be
followed. Perhaps more so then than ever. &ldquo;Who speaks against this proposal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no shortage of speakers there, though
everyone had regained herself enough for them to follow protocol. Several Sitters
moved at once, but Magla was first on her feet, and the others sat back with no
outward displays of impatience. Faiselle followed Magla, and Varilin followed
Faiselle. Then came Saroiya, and finally Takima. Each spoke at length, Varilin
and Saroiya coming very near making the forbidden speeches, and each spoke with
all the eloquence she could summon. No one reached a Sitter&rsquo;s chair lacking
eloquence at need. Even so, it soon became clear that they were repeating
themselves and each other, just in different words.</p>

<p>The Forsaken and their weapon were never mentioned.
The Black Tower was the Sitters&rsquo; topic, the Black Tower and the Asha&rsquo;man. The
Black Tower was a blight on the face of the earth, as great a threat to the
world as the Last Battle itself. The very name suggested connections to the
Shadow, not to mention being a direct slap at the White Tower. The so-called
Asha&rsquo;man&mdash;no one used the name without adding &ldquo;so-called,&rdquo; or saying it with a
sneer; &ldquo;guardians&rdquo; it meant in the Old Tongue, and they were <em>anything</em> but
guardians&mdash;the so-called Asha&rsquo;man were men who could <em>channel!</em> Men
doomed to go insane if the male half of the Power did not kill them first.
Madmen wielding the One Power. From Magla to Takima, every one of them invested
that with every scrap of horror in them. Three thousand years of the world&rsquo;s
horror, and the Breaking of the World before that. Men like this had <em>destroyed</em>
the world, destroyed the Age of Legends and changed the face of the world
to desolation. This was who they were being asked to make <em>alliance</em> with.
If they did so, they would be anathema in every nation, and rightly. They would
be scorned by every Aes Sedai, and rightly. It could not be. It <em>could</em> not.</p>

<p>When Takima finally sat, arranging her shawl carefully
along her arms, she wore a small but quite satisfied smile. Together they had
managed to make the Asha&rsquo;man seem more fearsome, more dangerous, than the
Forsaken and the Last Battle combined. Maybe even a match for the Dark One
himself.</p>

<p>Since Egwene had begun the ritual questions, it was
for her to finish, and she rose long enough to say, &ldquo;Who stands for an agreement
with the Black Tower?&rdquo; She had only thought there was silence in the pavilion
before. Sheriam had finally governed her weeping, though tears glistened on her
cheeks still, but her gulp sounded like shouts in the quiet that followed that
question.</p>

<p>Takima&rsquo;s smile slid sideways when Janya stood as soon
as the question left Egwene&rsquo;s mouth. &ldquo;Even a slim branch is better than no
branch when you&rsquo;re drowning,&rdquo; Janya said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather try than trust to hope
until I go under.&rdquo; She had the habit of speaking when she was not supposed to.</p>

<p>Samalin rose to stand beside Malind, and suddenly
there was a rush, Salita and Berana and Aledrin together, with Kwamesa only a
tick behind. Nine Sitters on their feet, and there it hung as the moments
stretched out. Egwene realized she was biting her lip and stopped hurriedly,
hoping no one had noticed. She could still feel the impression of her teeth.
She hoped she had not drawn blood. Not that anyone was looking at her. Everyone
seemed to be holding their breath.</p>

<p>Romanda sat frowning up at Salita, who was staring
straight ahead, her face gray and her lips trembling. The Tairen sister might
not be able to hide her fear, but she was going ahead. Romanda nodded slowly
and then, shockingly, stood. She, too, decided to violate custom. &ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo;
she said, looking straight at Lelaine, &ldquo;we must do things we would rather not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lelaine met the gray-haired Yellow&rsquo;s eyes without
blinking.</p>

<p>Her face might have been cast in porcelain. Her chin
rose by slow increments. And suddenly, she stood, glancing down impatiently at
Lyrelle, who gaped at her a moment before coming to her feet.</p>

<p>Everyone stared. No one made a sound. It was done.</p>

<p>Almost done, anyway. Egwene cleared her throat, trying
to catch Sheriam&rsquo;s attention. The next part was the Keeper&rsquo;s, but Sheriam stood
scrubbing the tears from her cheeks with her fingers and running her eyes along
the benches as if counting how many Sitters were standing and hoping to find
she had miscounted. Egwene cleared her throat more loudly, and the green-eyed
woman gave a start and turned to stare at her. Even then, it seemed to take
forever before she recalled herself to her duty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lesser consensus standing,&rdquo; she announced in an unsteady voice, &ldquo;an
agreement will be sought with&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;with the Black Tower.&rdquo; Inhaling deeply, she
straightened to her full height, and her voice gained strength. She was back
onto familiar ground. &ldquo;In the interest of unity, I ask for the greater
consensus to stand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was a powerful call. Even on matters that could be decided by the
lesser consensus, unanimity was always preferred, always strived for. Hours of
discussion, days, might go into reaching it, but the effort would not stop until
every Sitter agreed or it was clear as well water that there could be no
agreement. A powerful call, one that tugged at every sister. Delana rose like
a puppet drawn up against her will, looking around uncertainly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot stand for this,&rdquo; Takima said, against all
decorum. &ldquo;No matter what anyone says, no matter how long we sit, I cannot and I
will not! I&mdash;will&mdash;<em>not!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one else stood, either. Oh, Faiselle shifted on her
bench, half moved as if to stand, adjusted her shawl, twitched again as if she might
stand. That was as close as anyone came. Saroiya was biting her knuckle with
an expression of horror, and Varilin wore the look of a woman who had been hit
between the eyes with a hammer. Magla gripped the ends of her bench, holding
herself in place and staring bleakly at the carpets in front of her. Plainly,
she was aware of the scowl Romanda was aiming at the back of her neck, but her
only response was to hunch her shoulders.</p>

<p>Takima should have been the end of it. There was no point in seeking the
greater consensus when someone made it plain she would not stand. But Egwene
decided to make her own break with decorum and protocol. &ldquo;Is there anyone who
feels she must leave her chair over this?&rdquo; she asked in a loud, clear voice.</p>

<p>Gasps filled the pavilion, but she was holding her
breath. This could shatter them, but better to have it out in the open now, if
that was what was to come of it. Saroiya looked at her wildly, but no one
moved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we will go forward,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Carefully. It
will take time to plan exactly who is to approach the Black Tower, and what
they are to say.&rdquo; Time for her to plant a few safeguards, it was to be hoped.
Light, she was going to have to scramble to deal with this. &ldquo;First, are there
suggestions for our&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;embassy?&rdquo;</p>
