<h4><em>The Forging of a Hammer</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">H</span><em>e ran easily through the night in spite of the
 snow that covered the ground. He was one with the shadows, slipping through
 the forest, the moonlight almost as clear to his eyes as the light of the
 sun. A cold wind ruffled his thick fur, and suddenly brought a scent that
 made his hackles stand and his heart race with a hatred greater than that for
 the Neverborn. Hatred, and a sure knowledge of death coming. There were no
 choices to be made, not now. He ran harder, toward death.</em></p>

<p>Perrin woke abruptly in the deep darkness before dawn,
beneath one of the high-wheeled supply carts. Cold had seeped into his bones
from the ground despite his heavy fur-lined cloak and two blankets, and there
was a fitful breeze, not strong or steady enough to be called a light wind, but
icy. When he scrubbed at his face with gauntleted hands, frost crackled in his
short beard. At least it seemed not to have snowed any more during the night.
Too often he had awakened covered with a dusting despite the shelter of a cart,
and snowfall made things difficult for the scouts. He wished he could speak
with Elyas the same way he talked with wolves. Then he would not have to endure
this endless waiting. Weariness clung to him like a second skin; he could not
recall when he had last had a sound night&rsquo;s sleep. Sleep, or the lack of it,
seemed unimportant anyway. These days, only the heat of anger gave him the
strength to keep moving.</p>

<p>He did not think it was the dream that had wakened him. Every night he
lay down expecting nightmares, and every night they came. In the worst, he
found Faile dead, or never found her. Those woke him up in shivering sweats.
Anything less horrible, he slept through, or only half-woke with Trollocs
cutting him up alive for the cookpot or a Draghkar eating his soul. This dream
was fading quickly, in the manner of dreams, yet he remembered being a wolf and
smelling&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;What? Something wolves hated more than they did Myrddraal.
Something a wolf knew would kill him. The knowledge he had had in the dream was
gone; only vague impressions remained. He had not been in the wolf dream, that
reflection of this world where dead wolves lived on and the living could go to
consult them. The wolf dream always remained clear in his head after he left,
whether he had gone there consciously or not. Yet this dream still seemed real,
and somehow urgent.</p>

<p>Lying motionless on his back, he sent his mind
questing, feeling for wolves. He had tried using wolves to help his hunt, to
no avail. Convincing them to take an interest in the doings of two-legs was
difficult, to say the least. They avoided large parties of men, and for them,
half a dozen was large enough to stay clear of. Men chased away game, and most
men tried to kill a wolf on sight. His thoughts found nothing, but then, after
a time, he touched wolves, at a distance. How far, he could not be sure, but it
was like catching a whisper almost on the edge of hearing. A long way. That was
strange. Despite scattered villages and manors and even the occasional town,
this was prime country for wolves, untouched forest for the most part, with
plenty of deer and smaller game.</p>

<p>There was always a formality to speaking with a pack
you were not part of. Politely, he sent his name among wolves, Young Bull,
shared his scent, and received theirs in reply, Leafhunter and Tall Bear, White
Tail and Feather and Thunder Mist, a cascade of others. It was a sizable pack,
and Leafhunter, a female with a feel of quiet certainty, was their leader.
Feather, clever and in his prime, was her mate. They had heard of Young Bull,
were eager to speak with the friend of the fabled Long Tooth, the first
two-legs who had learned to speak with wolves after a gap of time that carried the feel of Ages vanished into the mists of the past.
It was all a torrent of images and memories of scents that his mind turned
into words, as the words he thought somehow became images and scents they could
understand.</p>

<p><em>There is something I want to learn</em>, he thought, once the greetings were done. <em>What
would a wolf hate more than the Neverborn?</em> He tried to recall the scent
from the dream, to add that, but it was gone from his memory. <em>Something that
a wolf knows means death.</em></p>

<p>Silence answered him, and a thread of fear blended with hatred and
determination and reluctance. He had felt fear from wolves before&mdash;above all
things they feared the wildfire that raced through a forest, or so he would
have said&mdash;but this was the prickling sort of fear that made a man&rsquo;s skin
crawl, made him shiver and jump at things unseen. Laced with the resolution to
go on no matter what, it felt close to terror. Wolves never experienced that
kind of dread. Except that these did.</p>

<p>One by one they faded from his consciousness, a deliberate act of
shutting him out, until only Leafhunter remained. <em>The Last Hunt is coming</em>, she
said at last, and then she also was gone.</p>

<p><em>Did I offend?</em> he sent. <em>If I did, it was in ignorance.</em> But there was no
reply. These wolves, at least, would not speak with him again, not any time
soon.</p>

<p><em>The Last Hunt is coming.</em> That was what wolves called the Last Battle, Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don. They knew
they would be there, at the final confrontation between the Light and the
Shadow, though why was something they could not explain. Some things were
fated, as sure as the rise and fall of the sun and the moon, and it was fated
that many wolves would die in the Last Hunt. What they feared was something
else. Perrin had a strong sense that he also had to be there, was meant to be
at least, but if the Last Battle came soon, he would not be. He had a job of
work in front of him that he could not shirk&mdash;would not!&mdash;even for Tarmon
Gai&rsquo;don.</p>

<p>Putting nameless fears and the Last Battle alike out
of his mind, he fumbled his gauntlets off and felt in his coat pocket for the
length of rawhide cord he kept there. In a morning ritual, his fingers made
another knot mechanically, then slid down the cord, counting. Twenty-two knots.
Twenty-two mornings since Faile was kidnapped.</p>

<p>At the start, he had not thought there was need to
keep count. That first day, he had believed he was cold and numb but focused,
yet looking back he could see he had been overwhelmed by unbound rage and a
consuming need to find the Shaido as fast as possible. Men from other clans had
been among the Aiel who had stolen Faile, yet on the evidence, most were
Shaido, and that was how he thought of them. The need to rip Faile away from
them, before she could be hurt, had gripped him by the throat till he almost
choked. He would rescue the other women captured with her, of course, but
sometimes he had to list their names in his head to make sure he did not forget
them entirely. Alliandre Maritha Kigarin, Queen of Ghealdan, and his liege
woman. It still seemed off-kilter to have anyone oathsworn to him, especially a
queen&mdash;he was a blacksmith! He had been a blacksmith, once&mdash;but he had
responsibilities toward Alliandre, and she would never have been in danger
except for him. Bain of the Black Rock Shaarad and Chiad of the Stones River
Goshien, Aiel Maidens of the Spear who had followed Faile to Ghealdan and
Amadicia. They had faced Trollocs in the Two Rivers, as well, when Perrin
needed every hand that could raise a weapon, and that earned them the right to
call on him. Arrela Shiego and Lacile Aldorwin, two foolish young women who
thought they could learn to be Aiel, or some strange version of Aiel. They were
oathsworn to Faile, and so was Maighdin Dorlain, a penniless refugee Faile had
taken under her wing as one of her maids. He could not abandon Faile&rsquo;s people.
Faile ni Bashere t&rsquo;Aybara.</p>

<p>The litany came back to her, his wife, the breath of
his life. With a groan, he clutched the cord so tightly that the knots
impressed themselves painfully on a hand hardened by long days swinging the
hammer at a forge. Light, twenty-two days!</p>

<p>Working iron had taught him that haste ruined metal,
but in the beginning, he had been hasty, Traveling southward through gateways
created by Grady and Neald, the two Asha&rsquo;man, to where the farthest traces of
the Shaido had been found, then leaping south again, the direction their tracks
went, as soon as the Asha&rsquo;man could make more gateways. Fretting every hour it
took them to rest from making the first and holding them open long enough for
everyone to pass through, his mind was eaten up with freeing Faile at any cost.
What he found were days of increasing pain as the scouts spread farther and
farther through uninhabited wilderness without locating the slightest sign that
anyone had been that way before, until he knew he had to retrace his path,
frittering away more days to cover ground the Asha&rsquo;man had taken him across in
a step, searching for any indication of where the Shaido had turned aside.</p>

<p>He should have known they would turn. South took them toward warmer
lands, without the snow that seemed so strange to Aiel, yet it took them closer
to the Seanchan in Ebou Dar, as well. He knew about the Seanchan, and he should
have expected the Shaido to learn! They were after pillage, not a fight with
Seanchan and <em>damane.</em> Days of slow marching with the scouts fanning out
ahead, days when falling snow blinded even the Aiel and forced them all to a
chafing halt, until finally Jondyn Barran found a tree scraped by a wagon and
Elyas dug a broken Aiel spear shaft from beneath the snow. And Perrin at last
turned east, at most two days south of where he had Traveled to the first time.
He had wanted to howl when he realized that, yet he kept a tight hold on
himself. He could not give way, not so much as an inch, not when Faile was
depending on him. That was when he began to husband his anger, began to forge
it.</p>

<p>Her kidnappers had gained a long lead because he was
hasty, but since then, he had been as careful as he had been in a smithy. His
anger was hardened and shaped to a purpose. Since finding the Shaido&rsquo;s trail
again, he had Traveled no farther in one jump than the scouts could go and come
between sunrise and sunset, and it was well that he had been cautious, because
the Shaido changed directions suddenly several times, zigzagging almost as
though they could not decide on a destination. Or maybe they had turned to
joined others of their kind. All he had to go by were old traces, old camps
buried by snow, yet all of the scouts agreed the Shaido&rsquo;s numbers had swollen.
There had to be at least two or three septs together, maybe more, a formidable
quarry to hunt. Slowly but surely, though, he had begun overtaking them. That
was what was important.</p>

<p>The Shaido covered more ground on the march than he
would have thought possible, given their numbers and the snow, yet they did not
seem to care whether anyone was tracking them. Perhaps they believed no one dared.
Sometimes they had camped several days in one spot. Anger forged to a purpose.
Ruined villages and small towns and estates littered the Shaido&rsquo;s path as if
they were human locusts, storehouses and valuables looted, men and women
carried off along with the livestock. Often no one remained by the time he
arrived, only empty houses, the people seeking somewhere for food to survive
until spring. He had crossed the Eldar into Altara where a small ferry used by
peddlers and local farmers, not merchants, once ran between two villages on the
forested river-banks. How the Shaido had gotten across, he did not know, but he
had the Asha&rsquo;man make gateways. All that remained of the ferry were the rough
stone landings on either bank, and the few unburned structures were deserted
except for three slat-ribbed feral dogs that slunk away at the sight of humans.
Anger hardened and shaped for a hammer.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, he had come to a tiny village where a double handful
of stunned, dirty-faced people had stared at the hundreds of lancers and bowmen
riding out of the forest at first light behind the Red Eagle of Manetheren and
the crimson Wolfshead, the Silver Stars of Ghealdan and the Golden Hawk of
Mayene, followed by long lines of high-wheeled carts and strings of remounts.
At first sight of Gaul and the other Aiel, those people overcame their
paralysis and began running for the trees in panic. Catching a few to answer
questions had been difficult; they were ready to run themselves to death rather
than let an Aiel near. Brytan had consisted of only a dozen families, but the
Shaido had carried off nine young men and women from there, along with all of
their animals, only two days ago. Two days. A hammer was a tool with a purpose,
and a target.</p>

<p>He knew he had to be careful, or lose Faile forever, but being too
careful could lose her, too. Early yesterday he had told those who were going
ahead to scout that they were to go farther than before, push on harder,
returning only with a full turn of the sun unless they found the Shaido sooner.
In a little while the sun would rise, and at most a few hours after that, Elyas
and Gaul and the others would return, the Maidens and Two Rivers men he knew
could track a shadow across water. As fast as the Shaido moved, the scouts
could move faster. They were not encumbered with families and wagons and
captives. This time, they would be able to tell him exactly where the Shaido
were. They would. He knew it in his bones. The certainty flowed in his veins.
He would find Faile and free her. That came before anything, even living, so
long as he lived long enough to accomplish it, yet he <em>was</em> a hammer, now,
and if there was any way to accomplish it, any way at all, he intended to
hammer these Shaido into scrap.</p>

<p>Tossing the blankets aside, Perrin tugged his
gauntlets back on, gathered his axe from where it lay beside him, a half-moon
blade balanced by a heavy spike, and rolled out into the open, rising to his
feet on trampled, frozen snow. Carts stood all around him in rows, in what had
been Brytan&rsquo;s fields. The arrival of more strangers, so many, and armed, with
their foreign banners, had been more than the survivors of the little village
could absorb. As soon as Perrin would let them, the pitiful remnant had fled
into the forest, carrying what they could on their backs and on drag-sleds.
They had run as hard as if Perrin was another Shaido, not looking back for fear
he was following them.</p>

<p>As he slipped the axe haft through the thick loop on his belt, a deeper
shadow beside a nearby cart grew taller and resolved into a man swathed in a
cloak that seemed black in the darkness. Perrin was not surprised; the nearby
horselines thickened the air with the smell of several thousand animals, mounts
and remounts and cart horses, not to mention the sweet stink of horse dung, but
he still had caught the other&rsquo;s scent on waking. Man smell always stood out.
Besides, Aram was always there when Perrin woke, waiting. A waning sickle moon
low in the sky still gave enough light for him to make out the other man&rsquo;s face,
if not clearly, and the brass-pommeled hilt of his sword slanting up past his
shoulder. Aram had been a Tinker once, but Perrin did not think he would be
again, even if he did wear a brightly striped Tinker coat. There was a frowning
hardness about Aram now that moon shadows could not hide. He stood as though
ready to draw that sword, and since Faile was taken, anger seemed a permanent
part of his scent. A great deal had changed when Faile was taken. Anyway,
Perrin understood anger. He had not, not really, before Faile was taken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They want to see you, Lord Perrin,&rdquo; Aram said, jerking his head toward
two dim forms farther away between the lines of carts. The words came out in a
faint mist in the cold air. &ldquo;I told them to let you sleep.&rdquo; It was a fault Aram
had, looking after him too much, unasked.</p>

<p>Testing the air, Perrin separated out the scents of those two shadows
from the masking smell of the horses. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see them now. Have Stepper readied
for me, Aram.&rdquo; He tried to be in the saddle before the rest of the camp woke.
Partly that was because standing still for long seemed beyond him. Standing
still was not catching the Shaido. Partly it was to avoid having to share
anyone&rsquo;s company he could avoid. He would have gone out with the scouts himself
if the men and women already doing that job were not so much better at it than
he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my Lord.&rdquo; A jaggedness entered Aram&rsquo;s scent as
he trudged away across the snow, but Perrin barely noted it. Only something
important would make Sebban Balwer root himself out of his blankets in the
dark, and as for Selande Darengil&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Balwer appeared skinny even in a bulky cloak, his
pinched face all but hidden in the deep hood. Had he stood straight instead of
hunching, he still would have been at most a hand taller than the Cairhienin
woman, who was not tall. With his arms wrapped around himself, he was hopping
from one foot to the other, trying to avoid the cold that must be soaking
through his boots. Selande, in a man&rsquo;s dark coat and breeches, made a good
effort at ignoring the temperature despite the feathery white that marked every
breath. She was shivering, but managed to swagger standing still, with one side
of her cloak thrown back and a gloved hand on the hilt of her sword. The hood
of her cloak was lowered, too, exposing hair cut short except for the tail in
the back that was tied at the nape of her neck with a dark ribbon. Selande was
the leader of those fools who wanted to be imitation Aiel, Aiel who carried
swords. Her scent was soft and thick, like a jelly. She was worried. Balwer
smelled&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;intent&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but then, he nearly always did, though there was
never any heat to his intensity, only focus.</p>

<p>The skinny little man stopped hopping to make a stiff,
hurried bow. &ldquo;The Lady Selande has news I think you should hear from her lips,
my Lord.&rdquo; Balwer&rsquo;s thin voice was dry and precise, just like its owner. He
would sound the same with his neck on a headsman&rsquo;s block. &ldquo;My Lady, if you
would?&rdquo; He was only a secretary&mdash;Faile&rsquo;s secretary, and Perrin&rsquo;s&mdash;a fussy
self-effacing fellow for the most part, and Selande was a noblewoman, but
Balwer made that more than a request.</p>

<p>She gave him a sharp sideways glance, shifting her
sword, and Perrin tensed to grab her. He did not think she would actually draw
on the man, but then again, he was not sure enough of her, or any of her
ridiculous friends, to put it out of the question. Balwer merely watched her,
his head tilted to one side, and his smell carried impatience, not concern.</p>

<p>With a toss of her head, Selande turned her attention
to Perrin. &ldquo;I see you, Lord Perrin Goldeneyes,&rdquo; she began in the crisp accents
of Cairhien, but, aware that he had little patience for her pretend Aiel
formality, she hurried on. &ldquo;I have learned three things tonight. First, the
least important, Haviar reported that Masema sent another rider back toward
Amadicia yesterday. Nerion tried to follow, but lost him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell Nerion I said he isn&rsquo;t to follow anybody,&rdquo;
Perrin told her sharply. &ldquo;And tell Haviar the same. They should know that! They
are to watch, listen, and report what they see and hear, no more. Do you
understand me?&rdquo; Selande gave a quick nod, a thorn of fear entering her scent
for a moment. Fear of him, Perrin supposed, fear that he was angry with her.
Yellow eyes on a man made some people uneasy. He took his hand from his axe
and clasped both hands behind his back.</p>

<p>Haviar and Nerion were more of Faile&rsquo;s two dozen young
fools, one Tairen, the other Cairhienin. Faile had used the lot of them for
eyes-and-ears, a fact that still irritated him for some reason, though she had
told him to his face that spying was a wife&rsquo;s business. A man needed to listen
hard when he thought his wife was joking; she might not be. The whole notion of
spying made him uncomfortable, but if Faile could use them so, then so could
her husband, when there was need. Just the two, though. Masema seemed convinced
that everyone except Darkfriends were fated to follow him sooner or later, yet
he might grow suspicious if too many left Perrin&rsquo;s camp to join him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call him Masema, not even here,&rdquo; he added
brusquely. Lately the man claimed Masema Dagar was actually dead and risen from
the grave as the Prophet of the Lord Dragon Reborn, and he was touchier than
ever about mention of his former name. &ldquo;You get careless with your tongue in
the wrong place, and you might be lucky if he just has a few of his bullyboys
flog you the next time they can find you alone.&rdquo; Selande nodded again, gravely,
and this time without any fear smell. Light, those idiots of Faile&rsquo;s lacked the
sense to recognize what they should be afraid of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost dawn,&rdquo; Balwer murmured, shivering and pulling his cloak
tighter. &ldquo;All will be waking before long, and some matters are best discussed
unseen. If my Lady will continue?&rdquo; Once again, that was more than a suggestion.
Selande and the rest of Faile&rsquo;s hangers-on had been good only for causing
trouble, that Perrin could see, and Balwer looked to be trying to put a fly up
her nose for some reason, but she actually gave an embarrassed start and
murmured an apology.</p>

<p>The darkness truly was beginning to lessen, Perrin
realized, at least to his eyes. The sky overhead still looked black, dusted
with bright stars, yet he could almost make out the colors of the six thin
stripes that crossed the front of Selande&rsquo;s coat. He could tell one from
another, anyway. The realization that he had slept later than usual made him
growl. He could not afford to give in to weariness, however tired he was! He
needed to hear Selande&rsquo;s report&mdash;she would not be worried about Masema sending
out riders; the man did that almost every day&mdash;yet he looked anxiously for
Aram and Stepper. His ears picked up the sounds of activity among the
horselines, but there was no sign of his horse yet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The second thing, my Lord,&rdquo; Selande said, &ldquo;is that
Haviar has seen casks of salt fish and salt beef branded with Altaran markings,
a great many of them. He says there are Altarans among Mas&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;among the
Prophet&rsquo;s people, too. Several appear to be craftsfolk, and one or two could be
merchants or town officials. Established men and women, in any case, solid
folk, and some seem unsure they made the right decision. A few questions might
reveal from where the fish and beef came. And perhaps gain more eyes-and-ears
for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know where the fish and beef came from and so do
you,&rdquo; Perrin said irritably. His hands knotted into fists behind his back. He
had hoped the speed with which he was moving would keep Masema from sending out
raiding parties. That was what they were, and as bad as the Shaido if not
worse. They offered people a chance to swear to the Dragon Reborn, and those
who refused, sometimes those who simply hesitated too long, died by fire and
steel. In any case, whether or not they marched off to follow Masema, those who
swore were expected to donate generously in support of the Prophet&rsquo;s cause,
while those who died were plainly Darkfriends, their belongings forfeit.
Thieves lost a hand, by Masema&rsquo;s laws, but none of what his raiders did was
thieving, according to Masema. By his laws, murder and a whole host of other
crimes merited hanging, yet a fair number of his followers seemed to prefer
killing to receiving oaths. There was more loot, that way, and for some of them
murder was a fine game to play before eating.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell them to keep clear of these Altarans,&rdquo; Perrin
went on. &ldquo;All sorts drift into Masema&rsquo;s following, and even if they are having
second thoughts, it won&rsquo;t take them long to stink of zeal like the rest. They
wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to gut a neighbor then, much less somebody who&rsquo;s asked the
wrong questions. What I want to know is what Masema&rsquo;s doing, what he&rsquo;s
planning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That the man had some scheme seemed obvious. Masema
claimed it was blasphemy for anyone except Rand to touch the One Power, claimed
he wanted nothing more than to join Rand in the east. As always, thought of
Rand brought colors whirling through Perrin&rsquo;s head, more vividly than usual
this time, but anger melted them to vapor. Blasphemy or no, Masema had accepted
Traveling, which was not just channeling but <em>men</em> channeling. And no
matter what he claimed, he had done it to remain in the west as long as
possible, not to help rescue Faile. Perrin tended to trust people until they
proved unreliable, but one sniff of Masema had told him the fellow was as
insane as a rabid animal and less trustworthy.</p>

<p>He had considered ways to stop that scheme, whatever
it was. Ways to stop Masema&rsquo;s killing and burning. Masema had ten or twelve
thousand men with him, maybe more&mdash;the man was not very forthcoming about
numbers, and the way they camped in a squalid sprawl made counting impossible&mdash;while less than a quarter of that number followed Perrin, several hundred of
them cart drivers and grooms and others who would be more hindrance than help in a fight, yet with three Aes Sedai and two
Asha&rsquo;man, not to mention six Aiel Wise Ones, he could halt Masema in his
tracks. The Wise Ones and two of the Aes Sedai would be eager to take part.
More than simply willing, at least. They wanted Masema dead. But dispersing
Masema&rsquo;s army would only break it into hundreds of smaller bands that would
scatter across Altara and beyond, still looting and killing, just for
themselves instead of in the name of the Dragon Reborn. <em>Breaking the Shaido
will do the same thing</em>, he thought, and pushed the thought away. Stopping
Masema would take time he did not have. The man would have to keep until Faile
was safe. Until the Shaido were smashed to kindling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the third thing you learned tonight, Selande?&rdquo; he said roughly.
To his surprise, the smell of worry coming from the woman thickened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haviar saw someone,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;He did not tell me at first.&rdquo;
Her voice hardened for a moment. &ldquo;I made sure that will not happen again!&rdquo;
Drawing a deep breath, she seemed to struggle with herself, then burst out,
&ldquo;Masuri Sedai has visited Masema&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the Prophet. It is true, my Lord;
believe me! Haviar has seen her more than once. She slips into their camp
hooded and leaves the same way, but he has had a good look at her face twice. A
man accompanies her each time, and sometimes another woman. Haviar has not seen
the man well enough to be sure, but the description fits Rovair, Masuri&rsquo;s
Warder, and Haviar is certain the second woman is Annoura Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She broke off abruptly, her eyes shining darkly in the moonlight as she
watched him. Light, she was as worried about how he would take it as by what it
meant! He forced his hands to unclench. Masema despised Aes Sedai as much as he
did Darkfriends; he nearly considered them Darkfriends. So why would he receive
two sisters? Why would they go to him? Annoura&rsquo;s opinion of Masema lay hidden
behind Aes Sedai mystery and double-jointed comments that could mean anything,
but Masuri had said straight out that the man needed to be put down like a mad
dog.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make sure Haviar and Nerion keep a sharp eye for the
sisters and see if they can eavesdrop on one of their meetings with Masema.&rdquo;
Could Haviar be mistaken? No, there were few women in Masema&rsquo;s camp, relatively
speaking, and it passed belief that the Tairen could mistake one of those unwashed murderous-eyed harridans for
Masuri. The sort of women willing to march with Masema usually made the men
look like Tinkers. &ldquo;Tell them to take care, though. Better to let the chance
pass than get caught at it. They&rsquo;re no good to anyone strung up on a tree.&rdquo;
Perrin knew he sounded gruff, and tried to make his voice milder. That seemed
harder since Faile was kidnapped. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done well, Selande.&rdquo; At least he did
not sound as if he were barking at her. &ldquo;You and Haviar and Nerion. Faile would
be proud if she knew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A smile lit up her face, and she stood a little
straighter, if that was possible. Pride, clean and bright, the pride of
accomplishment, almost overwhelmed any other scent from her! &ldquo;Thank you, my
Lord. Thank you!&rdquo; You would have thought he had given her a prize. Maybe he
had, come to think on it. Though come to think Faile might not be best pleased
that he was using her eyes-and-ears, or even knew about them. Once, the thought
of Faile displeased would have made him uneasy, but that was before he learned
about her spies. And that little matter of the Broken Crown that Elyas had let
slip. Everybody always said that wives kept their secrets close, but there were
limits!</p>

<p>Adjusting his cloak on his narrow shoulders with one hand, Balwer
coughed behind the other. &ldquo;Well said, my Lord. Very well said. My Lady, I&rsquo;m
sure you want to pass on Lord Perrin&rsquo;s instructions as soon as possible. It
wouldn&rsquo;t do for there to be any misunderstanding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Selande nodded without taking her eyes off Perrin. Her mouth opened, and
Perrin was sure she intended to say something about hoping he found water and
shade. Light, water was the one thing they had in plenty, even if it was mostly
frozen, and this time of year, nobody needed shade even at noon! She probably
did intend it, because she hesitated before saying, &ldquo;Grace favor you, my Lord.
If I may be so bold, Grace has favored the Lady Faile in you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin jerked his head in a nod of thanks. There was a
taste of ashes in his mouth. Grace had a funny way of favoring Faile, giving
her a husband who still had not found her after more than two weeks of
searching. The Maidens said she had been made <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>, that she would
not be mistreated, but they had to admit these Shaido already had broken their
customs a hundred different ways.</p>

<p>In his book, being kidnapped was mistreatment enough.
Bitter ashes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lady will do very well, my Lord,&rdquo; Balwer said
softly, watching Selande vanish into the darkness among the carts. This
approval was a surprise; he had tried to talk Perrin out of using Selande and
her friends on the grounds they were hotheaded and unreliable. &ldquo;She has the
necessary instincts. Cairhienin do, usually, and Tairens to some extent, at
least the nobles, especially once&mdash;&rdquo; He cut off abruptly, and eyed Perrin
cautiously. If he were another man, Perrin would have believed he had said more
than he intended, but he doubted Balwer slipped in that fashion. The man&rsquo;s
scent remained steady, not jiggling the way it would in a man who was unsure.
&ldquo;May I offer one or two points on her report, my Lord?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crunch of hooves in the snow announced the
approach of Aram, leading Perrin&rsquo;s dun stallion and his own rangy gray gelding.
The two animals were trying to nip at one another, and Aram was keeping them
well apart, though with some difficulty. Balwer sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can say whatever you need to in front of Aram,
Master Balwer,&rdquo; Perrin said. The little man bowed his head in acquiescence,
but he sighed again, too. Everybody in the camp knew that Balwer had the skill
of fitting together rumors and chance-heard comments and things people had done
to form a picture of what had really happened or what might, and Balwer himself
considered that part of his job as a secretary, but for some reason he liked to
pretend he never did any such thing. It was a harmless pretense, and Perrin
tended to humor him.</p>

<p>Taking Stepper&rsquo;s reins from Aram, he said, &ldquo;Walk
behind us awhile, Aram. I need to talk with Master Balwer in private.&rdquo; Balwer&rsquo;s
sigh was so faint that Perrin barely heard it.</p>

<p>Aram fell in behind the two of them without a word as they began to
walk, frozen snow cracking beneath their feet, but his scent grew spiky again,
and quivery, a thin, sour smell. This time, Perrin recognized the scent, though
he paid it no more mind than usual. Aram was jealous of anyone except Faile who
spent time with him. Perrin saw no way to put a stop to it, and anyway, he was
as used to Aram&rsquo;s possessiveness as he was to the way Balwer hopped along at his side, glancing over his shoulder
to see whether Aram was close enough to hear when he finally decided to speak.
Balwer&rsquo;s razor-thin scent of suspicion, curiously dry and not even warm but
still suspicion, provided a counterpoint to Aram&rsquo;s jealousy. You could not
change men who did not want to change.</p>

<p>The horselines and supply carts were located in the middle of the camp,
where thieves would have a hard time reaching them, and although the sky still
looked black to most eyes, the cart drivers and grooms, who slept close to
their charges, were already awake and folding their blankets, some tending
shelters made of pine boughs and other small tree limbs harvested from the surrounding
forest, in case they might be needed another night. Cook fires were being lit
and small black kettles set over them, though there was little to eat except
porridge or dried beans. Hunting and trapping added some meat, venison and
rabbits, partridges and woodhens and the like, but that could only go so far
with so many to feed, and there had been nowhere to buy supplies since before
crossing the Eldar. A ripple of bows and curtsies and murmurs of &ldquo;A good
morning, my Lord&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Light favor you, my Lord&rdquo; followed Perrin, but the
men and women who saw him stopped trying to strengthen their shelters, and a
few began to pull theirs down, as though they had sensed his determination from
his stride. They should have known his resolve by now. Since the day he realized
how badly he had blundered, he had not spent two nights in one place. He
returned the greetings without slowing.</p>

<p>The rest of the camp made a thin ring around the
horses and carts, facing the encircling forest, with the Two Rivers men divided
into four groups and the lancers from Ghealdan and Mayene spaced between them.
Whoever came at them, from whatever direction, would face Two Rivers longbows
and trained cavalry. It was not a sudden appearance by the Shaido that Perrin
feared, but rather Masema. The man seemed to be following him meekly enough,
but aside from this news of raiding, nine Ghealdanin and eight Mayeners had
vanished in the last two weeks, and no one believed they had deserted. Before
that, on the day Faile was stolen, twenty Mayeners had been ambushed and
killed, and no one believed it had been anyone but Masema&rsquo;s men who did the
killing. So an uneasy peace existed, a strange thorny sort of peace, yet a
copper wagered on it lasting forever was likely a copper lost. Masema
pretended to be unaware of any danger to that peace, but his followers seemed
not to care one way or the other, and whatever Masema pretended, they took
their lead from him. Somehow, though, Perrin intended to see that it endured
until Faile was free. Making his own camp too tough a nut to crack was one way
of making the peace last.</p>

<p>The Aiel had insisted on having their own thin wedge
of the strange pie, though there were fewer than fifty of them, counting the <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>
who served the Wise Ones, and he paused to study their low dark tents. The
only other tents erected anywhere in the camp were those of Berelain and her
two serving women, on the other side of the camp, not far from Brytan&rsquo;s few
houses. Fleas and lice in hordes made those uninhabitable, even for hardened
soldiers seeking shelter from the cold, and the barns were putrid ramshackle
affairs that let the wind howl through and harbored worse vermin than the
houses. The Maidens and Gaul, the only man among the Aiel not <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>, were
all out with the scouts, and the Aiel tents were silent and still, though the
smell of smoke coming from some of the vent holes told him the <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> were
preparing breakfast for the Wise Ones, or serving it. Annoura was Berelain&rsquo;s
adviser, and usually shared her tent, but Masuri and Seonid would be with the
Wise Ones, maybe even helping the <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> with breakfast. They still
tried to hide the fact that the Wise Ones considered them apprentices, though
everyone in camp must be aware of it by now. Anyone who saw an Aes Sedai
actually carrying firewood or water, or heard one being switched, could make
it out. The two Aes Sedai were oathsworn to Rand&mdash;again the colors whirled in
his head, an explosion of hues; again they melted under his constant anger&mdash;but Edarra and the other Wise Ones had been sent to keep an eye on them.</p>

<p>Only the Aes Sedai themselves knew how tightly their
oaths held them, or what room they saw to maneuver between the words, and
neither was allowed to hop unless a Wise One said toad. Seonid and Masuri had <em>both</em>
said Masema should be put down like a mad dog, and the Wise Ones agreed. Or
so they said. They had no Three Oaths to hold them to the truth, though in
truth, that particular Oath held the Aes Sedai more in letter than spirit. And
he seemed to recall one of the Wise Ones telling him that
Masuri thought that the mad dog could be leashed. Not allowed to hop unless a
Wise One said toad. It was like a blacksmith&rsquo;s puzzle with the edges of the
metal pieces sharpened. He needed to solve it, but one mistake and he could cut
himself to the bone.</p>

<p>From the
corner of his eye, Perrin caught Balwer watching him, lips pursed in thought. A
bird studying something unfamiliar, not afraid, not hungry, just curious.
Gathering Stepper&rsquo;s reins, he walked on so quickly that the little man had to
lengthen his stride into small jumps to catch up.</p>

<p>Two
Rivers men had the segment of camp next to the Aiel, facing northeast, and
Perrin considered walking a little north, to where Ghealdanin lancers were
camped, or south to the nearest Mayener section, but taking a deep breath, he
made himself lead his horse through his friends and neighbors from home. They
were all awake, huddling in their cloaks and feeding the remnants of their
shelters into the cook fires or cutting up the cold remains of last night&rsquo;s
rabbit to add to the porridge in the kettles. Talk dwindled and the smell of
wariness grew thick as heads lifted to watch him. Whetstones paused in sliding
along steel, then resumed their sibilant whispering. The bow was their
preferred weapon, but everyone carried a heavy dagger or a short-sword as well,
or sometimes a longsword, and they had picked up spears and halberds and other
polearms with strange blades and points that the Shaido had not thought worth
carrying off with their pillage. Spears they were accustomed to, and hands used
to wielding the quarterstaff at feastday competitions found the polearms not
much different once the weight of metal on one end was accounted for. Their
faces were hungry, tired and withdrawn.</p>

<p>Someone
raised a halfhearted cry of &ldquo;Goldeneyes!&rdquo; but no one took it up, a thing that
would have pleased Perrin a month gone. A great deal had changed since Faile
was taken. Now their silence was leaden. Young Kenly Maerin, his cheeks still
pale where he had scraped off his attempt at a beard, avoided meeting Perrin&rsquo;s
eyes, and Jori Congar, lightfingered whenever he saw anything small and
valuable and drunk whenever he could manage it, spat contemptuously as Perrin
passed by. Ban Crawe punched Jori&rsquo;s shoulder for it, hard, but Ban did not look
at Perrin either.</p>

<p>Dannil Lewin stood up, tugging nervously at the thick
mustache that looked so ridiculous beneath his beak of a nose. &ldquo;Orders, Lord
Perrin?&rdquo; The skinny man actually looked relieved when Perrin shook his head,
and he sat down again quickly, staring at the nearest kettle as though he were
anxious for the morning gruel. Maybe he was; nobody got a full belly lately,
and Dannil had never had much spare flesh on his bones. Behind Perrin, Aram
made a disgusted sound very like a growl.</p>

<p>There were others here besides Two Rivers folk, yet they were no better.
Oh, Lamgwin Dorn, a hulking fellow with scars on his face, tugged his forelock
and bobbed his head. Lamgwin looked like a shoulderthumper, a tavern tough, but
he was Perrin&rsquo;s bodyservant now, when he had need of one, which was not often,
and he might just want to keep in a good odor with his employer. But Basel
Gill, the stout onetime innkeeper Faile had taken on as their <em>shambayan</em>, busied
himself folding his blankets with exaggerated care, keeping his balding head
down, and Faile&rsquo;s chief maid, Lini Eltring, a bony woman whose tight white bun
made her face seem even narrower than it was, straightened from stirring a kettle,
her thin lips compressed, and raised her long wooden spoon as if to fend Perrin
off. Breane Taborwin, dark eyes fierce in her pale Cairhienin face, slapped
Lamgwin&rsquo;s arm hard and frowned up at him. She was Lamgwin&rsquo;s woman, if not his
wife, and the second of Faile&rsquo;s three maids. They would follow the Shaido till
they dropped dead, if necessary, and fall on Faile&rsquo;s neck when they found her,
but only Lamgwin had an ounce of welcome for Perrin. He might have gotten more
from Jur Grady&mdash;the Asha&rsquo;man were estranged from everyone else themselves, by
who and what they were, and neither had shown any animosity toward Perrin&mdash;but
despite the noise of people tramping about on the frozen snow and cursing when
they slipped, Grady was still wrapped in his blankets, snoring away beneath a
pine-branch lean-to. Perrin walked through his friends and neighbors and
servants and felt alone. A man could only proclaim his faithfulness so long
before he just gave up. The heart of his life lay somewhere to the northeast.
Everything would return to normal once he had her back.</p>

<p>A thicket of sharpened stakes ten paces deep encircled the camp, and he
went to the edge of the Ghealdanin lancers&rsquo; section, where angled paths had
been left for mounted men to ride out, though Balwer and Aram had to fall in
behind him in the narrow way. In front of the Two Rivers men, a man afoot would
have to twist and turn to make it through. The edge of the forest lay little
more than a hundred paces distant, easy bowshot for Two Rivers men, huge trees
thrusting a canopy high into the sky. Some of the trees here were strange to
Perrin, but there were pines and leatherleaf and elms out there, some as much
as three or four paces thick at the base, and oaks that were larger still.
Trees that big killed anything larger than weeds or small bushes that tried to
grow beneath them, leaving wide spaces between, but shadows darker than the
night filled those spaces. An old forest, one that could swallow armies whole and
never give up the bones.</p>

<p>Balwer followed him all the way through the stakes
before deciding that this was as close to alone with Perrin as he was likely to
get any time soon. &ldquo;The riders Masema has sent out, my Lord,&rdquo; he said, and
holding his cloak close he cast a suspicious look back at Aram, who met it with
a flat stare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Perrin said, &ldquo;you think they&rsquo;re going to the
Whitecloaks.&rdquo; He was eager to be moving, and that much farther from his
friends. He put the hand holding his reins on the saddlebow, but refrained from
putting a boot in the stirrup. Stepper tossed his head, also impatient. &ldquo;Masema
could be sending messages to the Seanchan just as easily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you have said, my Lord. A viable possibility, to be sure. May I
suggest once again, however, that Masema&rsquo;s view of Aes Sedai is very close to
that of the Whitecloaks? In fact, identical. He would see every last sister
dead, if he could. The Seanchan view is more&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;pragmatic, if I may be
permitted to call it that. Less in accord with Masema, in any case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;However much you hate Whitecloaks, Master Balwer,
they aren&rsquo;t at the root of every evil. And Masema has dealt with the Seanchan
before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you say, my Lord.&rdquo; Balwer&rsquo;s face did not change,
but he reeked of doubt. Perrin could not prove Masema&rsquo;s meetings with the
Seanchan, and telling anyone how he had learned of them would only add to his
present difficulties. That gave Balwer problems; he was a man who liked
evidence. &ldquo;As for the Aes Sedai and the Wise Ones, my Lord&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Aes Sedai
always seem to believe they know better than anyone else, except possibly
another Aes Sedai. I believe the Wise Ones are much the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin snorted brief white plumes in the air. &ldquo;Tell me
something I don&rsquo;t know. Like why Masuri would meet with Masema, and why the
Wise Ones allowed it. I&rsquo;ll wager Stepper against a horseshoe nail she didn&rsquo;t do
it without their permission.&rdquo; Annoura was another question, but she could be
acting on her own. It certainly seemed unlikely she was acting at Berelain&rsquo;s
behest.</p>

<p>Shifting his cloak on his shoulders, Balwer peered
back across the rows of sharpened stakes into the camp, toward the Aiel tents,
squinting as if he hoped to see through the tent walls. &ldquo;There are many
possibilities, my Lord,&rdquo; he said testily. &ldquo;For some who swear an oath, whatever
is not forbidden is permitted, and whatever is not commanded can be ignored.
Others take actions they believe will help their liege without first asking
permission. The Aes Sedai and the Wise Ones fall into one of those categories,
it seems, but further than that, I can only speculate, as matters stand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could just ask. Aes Sedai can&rsquo;t lie, and if I press
hard enough, Masuri might actually tell me the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Balwer grimaced as though at a sudden stomach pain.
&ldquo;Perhaps, my Lord. Perhaps. More likely is that she would tell you something
that sounds like the truth. Aes Sedai are experienced in that, as you know. In
any event, my Lord, Masuri would wonder how you knew to ask, and that line of
thought might lead to Haviar and Nerion. Under the circumstances, who can say
who she might tell? Straightforward is not always the best way. Sometimes,
certain things must be done behind masks, for safety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you the Aes Sedai couldn&rsquo;t be trusted,&rdquo; Aram
said abruptly. &ldquo;I told you that, Lord Perrin.&rdquo; He fell silent when Perrin
raised a hand, but the stink of fury from him was so strong that Perrin had to
exhale to clear his lungs. Part of him wanted to draw the scent deep and let it
consume him.</p>

<p>Perrin studied Balwer carefully. If Aes Sedai could
twist the truth till you could not tell up from down, and they could and did,
how far could you trust? Trust was always the question. He had learned that in
hard lessons. He took a firm check on his anger, though. A hammer had to be
used with care, and he was working a forge where one slip would tear the heart
out of his chest. &ldquo;And might matters change if some of Selande&rsquo;s friends began
spending more time among the Aiel? They want to be Aiel, after all. That ought
to give them enough excuse. And maybe one of them can strike up a friendship
with Berelain, and with her advisor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That should be possible, my Lord,&rdquo; Balwer said after the slightest
hesitation. &ldquo;Lady Medore&rsquo;s father is a High Lord of Tear, giving her sufficient
rank to approach the First of Mayene, and also a reason. Possibly one or two of
the Cairhienin stand high enough, as well. Finding those to live among the Aiel
will be easier still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin nodded. Infinite care with the hammer, however
much you wanted to smash whatever lay within reach. &ldquo;Then do it. But, Master
Balwer, you&rsquo;ve been trying to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;guide&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;me to this since Selande left
us. From now on, if you have a suggestion to make, make it. Even if I say no to
nine in a row, I&rsquo;ll always listen to a tenth. I&rsquo;m not a clever man, but I&rsquo;m
willing to listen to people who are, and I think you are. Just don&rsquo;t try poking
me in the direction you want me to go. I don&rsquo;t like that, Master Balwer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Balwer blinked, then of all things, bowed with his
hands folded at his waist. He smelled surprised. And gratified. Gratified? &ldquo;As
you say, my Lord. My previous employer disliked me suggesting actions unless I
was asked. I won&rsquo;t make the same mistake again, I assure you.&rdquo; Eyeing Perrin,
he seemed to reach a decision. &ldquo;If I may say so,&rdquo; he said carefully, &ldquo;I have
found serving you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;pleasant&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;in ways I did not expect. You are what
you seem, my Lord, with no poisoned needles hidden away to catch the unwary. My
previous employer was known widely for cleverness, but I believe you are
equally clever, in a different way. I believe I would regret leaving your
service. Any man might say these things to keep his place, but I mean them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poisoned needles? Before entering Perrin&rsquo;s service, Balwer&rsquo;s last
employment had been as secretary to a Murandian noblewoman fallen into hard
times who could no longer afford to keep him. Murandy must be a rougher place
than Perrin thought. &ldquo;I see no reason for you to leave my employ. Just tell me
what you want to do and let me decide, don&rsquo;t try to prod. And forget the flattery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never flatter, my Lord. But I am adept at shaping
myself to my master&rsquo;s needs; it is a requirement of my profession.&rdquo; The little
man bowed once more. He had never been this formal before. &ldquo;If you have no
further questions, my Lord, may I go to find the Lady Medore?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin nodded. The little man bowed yet again, backing
away, then went skittering toward the camp, his cloak fluttering behind him as
he dodged through the sharpened stakes like a sparrow hopping across the snow.
He was a strange fellow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust him,&rdquo; Aram muttered, staring after Balwer. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t
trust Selande and that lot. They&rsquo;ll throw in with the Aes Sedai, you mark my
words.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have to trust somebody,&rdquo; Perrin said roughly. The
question was, who? Swinging into Stepper&rsquo;s saddle, he booted the dun in the
ribs. A hammer was useless lying at rest.</p>
