<h4><em>A Strengthening Storm</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">M</span>idafternoon
 sunlight should have been slanting through the windows of Rand&rsquo;s bedchamber,
 but a hard rain was falling outside, and all the lamps were lit to hold off a
 twilight darkness. Thunder rattled the glass-filled casements in the windows.
 It was a fierce storm that had rolled down out of the Dragonwall faster than
 a running horse and brought a deeper cold, almost deep enough for snow. The
 raindrops pelting the house were half-frozen slush, and despite blazing logs
 on the hearthstone, a chill clung to the room.</p>

<p>Lying on his
bed with his booted feet propped one atop the other on the coverlet, he stared
up at the canopy and tried to put his thoughts in order. He could disregard the
thunderstorm outside, but Min, snuggling under his arm, was another matter.
She did not try to distract him; she just did it without trying. What was he to
do about her? About Elayne, and Aviendha. Those two were only vague presences
in his head, at this distance from Caemlyn. At least, he assumed they were
still in Caemlyn. Assuming was dangerous when it came to those two. All he had
of them at the moment was a general sense of direction and the knowledge they
were alive. Min&rsquo;s body was pressed tight against his side, though, and the bond made her as vibrant inside his
head as she was in the flesh. Was it too late to keep Min safe, to keep Elayne
and Aviendha safe?</p>

<p><em>What makes you think you can keep anyone safe?</em> Lews Therin whispered in his head. The dead madman
was an old friend, now. <em>We are</em> all <em>going to die. Just hope that you
aren&rsquo;t the one who kills them.</em> Not a welcome friend, just one he could not
rid himself of. He no longer feared killing Min or Elayne or Aviendha any more
than he feared going mad. Madder than he already was, at least, with a dead man
in his head, and sometimes a foggy face he could almost recognize. Did he dare
ask Cadsuane about either one?</p>

<p><em>Trust no one</em>, Lew Therin murmured, then gave a wry laugh. <em>Including me</em>.</p>

<p>Without warning, Min punched him in the ribs hard
enough to make him grunt. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting melancholy, sheepherder,&rdquo; she
growled. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re worrying about me again, I swear, I&rsquo;ll&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She had so
many different ways of growling, Min did, each matched to very different
sensations through the bond. There was the light irritation he felt from her
now, this time touched with worry, and sometimes there was a sharp edge as if
she were refraining from snapping his head off. There was a growl that almost
made him laugh from the amusement in her head, or as close to laughing as he
had come in what seemed a very long time, and a throaty growl that would have
heated his blood even without the bond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of that, now,&rdquo; she said warningly, before he
could move the hand resting on her back, and rolled off the bed to her feet,
tugging her embroidered coat straight with a reproving look. Since bonding him,
she was even better at reading his mind, and she had been good enough before.
&ldquo;What are you going to do about them, Rand? What is Cadsuane going to do?&rdquo;
Lightning flashed in the windows, almost bright enough to wash out the lamps,
and thunder boomed against the window glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t yet been able to see what she was going to
do ahead of time, Min. Why should today be different?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The thick feather mattress sagged beneath him as he
swung his legs over the side and sat up facing her. He almost pressed a hand to
the old wounds in his side without thinking, then caught himself and changed
the movement to buttoning up his coat. Half-healed and never healing, those two overlapping wounds hurt since Shadar
Logoth. Or maybe he was just more aware of how they throbbed, the heat of them
a furnace of fever trapped in an area smaller than the palm of his hand. One,
at least, he hoped, would begin to heal with Shadar Logoth gone. Maybe there
had just not been enough time yet for him to feel any difference. It was not
the same side that Min had fisted&mdash;she was always gentle with that, if not
always with the rest of him&mdash;but he thought he had kept the pain hidden from
her. No point in giving her something more to worry over. The concern in her
eyes, and in her head, must be about Cadsuane. Or the others.</p>

<p>The manor house and all of its outlying buildings were
crowded, now. It had seemed inevitable that sooner or later someone would try
using the Warders left in Cairhien; their Aes Sedai had not blared that they
were going off to find the Dragon Reborn, but neither had they been
particularly secretive. Even so, he had never anticipated those who arrived
with them. Davram Bashere with a hundred of his Saldaean light horse,
dismounting in a wind-driven soaking rain and muttering about ruined saddles.
Over half a dozen black-coated Asha&rsquo;man who for some reason had not shielded
themselves from the downpour. They rode with Bashere, but it had been like two
parties arriving, a little distance between them always, a strong whiff of
watchful wariness. And one of the Asha&rsquo;man was Logain Ablar. Logain! An
Asha&rsquo;man, wearing the Sword and Dragon on his collar! Bashere and Logain both
wanted to talk to him, but not in front of anyone, especially each other it
seemed. Unexpected or not, though, they were hardly the most surprising of the
visitors. He had thought the eight Aes Sedai must be more friends of Cadsuane,
yet he would swear she had been as surprised as he to see most of them. Odder,
all but one seemed to be with the Asha&rsquo;man! Not prisoners, and certainly not
guards, but Logain had been reluctant to explain with Bashere present, and
Bashere reluctant to leave Logain the first chance to talk to Rand alone. Now
they were all drying off and settling into their rooms, leaving him to try to
put his thoughts in order. To the extent that he could, with Min close by. What
<em>would</em> Cadsuane do? Well, he had tried to ask her advice. Events had
outrun both of them, though. The decision had been made, whatever Cadsuane
thought. Lightning flashed again in the windows. Lightning seemed to suit
Cadsuane. You could never tell where it would strike.</p>

<p><em>Alivia would finish her</em>, Lews Therin muttered. <em>She&rsquo;s going to help us die; she&rsquo;d remove
Cadsuane for us, if you tell her to.</em></p>

<p><em>I don&rsquo;t want to kill her</em>, Rand thought at the dead man. <em>I can&rsquo;t afford for her to die.</em> Lews
Therin knew that as well as he, but the man grumbled under his breath anyway.
Since Shadar Logoth, he seemed a touch less mad, sometimes. Or maybe Rand was a
touch more. After all, he took talking to a dead man in his head as a matter
of everyday, and that was hardly sane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have to do <em>something</em>,&rdquo; Min muttered,
folding her arms beneath her breasts. &ldquo;Logain&rsquo;s aura still speaks of glory,
stronger than ever. Maybe he still thinks he&rsquo;s the real Dragon Reborn. And
there&rsquo;s something&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;dark&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;in the images I saw around Lord Davram. If
he turns against you, or dies&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I heard one of the soldiers say Lord
Dobraine might die. Losing even one of them would be a blow. Lose all three,
and it might take you a year to recover.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve seen it, then it&rsquo;s going to happen. I have to do what I can,
Min, not worry over what I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; She gave him one of those looks women had in
great store, as if he were trying to start an argument.</p>

<p>A scratching at the door brought his head around and made Min shift her
stance. He suspected she had slipped a throwing knife out of her sleeve and was
hiding it behind her wrist. The woman carried more knives tucked about her than
Thom Merrilin had. Or Mat. Colors whirled in his head, almost resolving into&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;what? A man on a wagon seat? Not the face that sometimes appeared in his
thoughts, anyway, and the scene was gone in an instant, without any of the
dizziness that accompanied the face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he called, standing up.</p>

<p>Elza spread her dark green skirts in an elegant curtsy
when she entered, her eyes bright on his face. A pleasant-appearing woman, and
coolly complacent as a cat, she hardly seemed to see Min. Of all the sisters
who had sworn to him, Elza was the most eager. The only eager one, really. The
others had their reasons for swearing, their explanations, and of course Verin
and the sisters who came to find him at Dumai&rsquo;s Wells had no real choice facing
a <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, but for all Elza&rsquo;s outer coolness, she seemed to burn inside
with a passion to see he reached Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don. &ldquo;You said to let you know when
the Ogier came,&rdquo; she said, never taking her eyes from his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Loial!&rdquo; Min shouted gleefully, tucking the knife back
up her sleeve as she rushed past Elza, who blinked at the sight of the blade.
&ldquo;I could have killed Rand for letting you get off to your room before I saw
you!&rdquo; The bond said she did not mean it. Not exactly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Rand told Elza, listening to the sounds of merriment from
the sitting room, Min&rsquo;s light laughter and Loial&rsquo;s quake of Ogier mirth, like
the earth laughing. Thunder rolled across the sky.</p>

<p>Perhaps the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s passion extended to wanting to
know what he said to Loial, because her lips thinned, and she hesitated before
making another curtsy and sweeping out of the bedchamber. A brief pause in the
sounds of pleasure announced her passage across the sitting room, and their
resumption her departure. Only then did he seize the Power. He tried never to
let anyone see him do that.</p>

<p>Fire flooded into him, hotter than the sun, and cold
to make the worst blizzard seem spring, all a swirling rage that dwarfed the
storm outside, threatening to scour him away for a moment&rsquo;s inattention.
Seizing <em>saidin</em> was a war for survival. But the green of the cornices was
suddenly greener, the black of his coat blacker, the gold of its embroidery
more golden. He could see the grain of the vine-carved bedposts, see faint
marks left by the craftsman&rsquo;s sanding all those years ago. <em>Saidin</em> made
him feel as if he had been half-blind and numb without it. That was a part of
what he felt.</p>

<p><em>Clean</em>, Lews
Therin whispered. <em>Pure and clean again.</em></p>

<p>It was. The foulness that had marked the male half of the Power since
the Breaking was gone. That did not stop nausea from rising in Rand, though,
the violent urge to bend double and empty himself on the floor. The room seemed
to spin for an instant, and he had to put a hand on the nearest bedpost to
steady himself. He did not know why he should still feel this sickness, with
the taint gone. Lews Therin did not know, or would not tell. But the sickness
was the reason he could not let anyone see him take hold of <em>saidin</em>, if
he could help it. Elza might burn to see him reach the Last Battle, but too
many others wanted to see him fall, not all of them Darkfriends.</p>

<p>In that moment of weakness, the dead man reached for <em>saidin.</em> Rand
could feel him clawing for it greedily. Was it harder than it had been to push
him away? In some ways, Lews Therin seemed more solidly part of him since
Shadar Logoth. It did not matter. He had only so far left to go before he could
die. He just had to last that far. Drawing a deep breath, he ignored the
lingering traces of sickness in his belly and strode into the sitting room to
the crash of thunder.</p>

<p>Min stood in the middle of the room holding one of
Loial&rsquo;s hands in both of hers and smiling up at him. It took both of her hands
to hold one of Loial&rsquo;s, and the pair did not come close to covering it. The
top of his head missed the plaster ceiling by little more than a foot. He had
donned a fresh coat of dark blue wool, the bottom flaring over baggy trousers
to the tops of his knee-high boots, but for once his pockets did not bulge with
the angular shapes of books. Eyes the size of teacups lit up at the sight of
Rand, and the grin on his wide mouth really did split his face in two. The tufted
ears sticking up through his shaggy hair quivered with pleasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord Algarin has Ogier guest rooms, Rand,&rdquo; he boomed
in a voice like a deep drum. &ldquo;Can you imagine it? Six of them! Of course, they
haven&rsquo;t been used in some time, but they&rsquo;re aired out every week, so there
isn&rsquo;t any mustiness, and the bedsheets are very good linen. I thought I&rsquo;d be
back to doubling myself up in a human-sized bed. Umm. We aren&rsquo;t staying here
long, are we?&rdquo; His long ears sagged a little, then began to twitch uneasily. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think we should. I mean, I might get used to having a real bed, and that
wouldn&rsquo;t do if I&rsquo;m going to stay with you. I mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Well, you know what I
mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Rand said softly. He could have laughed at the Ogier&rsquo;s
consternation. He should have laughed. Laughter just seemed to have escaped
him, lately. Spinning a web against eavesdropping around the room, he knotted
it so he could release <em>saidin.</em> The last traces of nausea began to fade
immediately. He could control the
sickness, usually, with an effort, but there was no point when he did not have
to. &ldquo;Did any of your books get wet?&rdquo; Loial&rsquo;s main concern coming in had been to
check on his books.</p>

<p>Suddenly it struck him that he had thought of what he had done as
spinning a web. That was how Lews Therin would put it. That sort of thing
happened too often, the other man&rsquo;s turns of phrase drifting into his head, the
other man&rsquo;s memories mingling with his. He was Rand al&rsquo;Thor, not Lews Therin
Telamon. He had woven a ward and tied off the weave, not spun a web and knotted
it. But the one came to him as easily as the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My <em>Essays of Willim of Maneches</em> got damp,&rdquo; Loial said disgustedly,
rubbing his upper lip with a finger the thickness of a sausage. Had he been
careless shaving, or was that the beginning of a mustache beneath his wide
nose? &ldquo;The pages may spot. I shouldn&rsquo;t have been so careless, not with a book.
And my book of notes took some wet, too. But the ink didn&rsquo;t run. Everything is
still readable, but I really need to make a case to protect&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Slowly, a
frown crept onto his face, dangling the long ends of his eyebrows onto his
cheeks. &ldquo;You look tired, Rand. He looks tired, Min.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been doing too much, but he&rsquo;s resting now,&rdquo; Min
said defensively, and Rand did smile. A little. Min would always defend him,
even to his friends. &ldquo;You <em>are</em> resting, sheepherder,&rdquo; she added, letting
go of Loial&rsquo;s huge hand and planting her fists on her hips. &ldquo;Sit down and rest.
Oh, sit down, Loial. I&rsquo;ll put a crick in my neck if I keep staring up at you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial chuckled, the bellowing of a bull muted in his
throat, as he examined one of the straight-back chairs dubiously. Compared to
him, it seemed a chair made for a child. &ldquo;Sheepherder. You don&rsquo;t know how good
it is to hear you calling him sheepherder, Min.&rdquo; He sat down cautiously. The
plain-carved chair creaked under his weight, and his knees stuck up in front of
him. &ldquo;I am sorry, Rand, but it is funny, and I haven&rsquo;t heard much to laugh at
these past months.&rdquo; The chair was holding. With a quick glance toward the hall
door, he added, a little too loudly, &ldquo;Karldin doesn&rsquo;t have much sense of
humor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can speak freely,&rdquo; Rand told him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re safe
behind a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a ward.&rdquo; He had almost said behind a shield, which was not the
same thing. Except that he knew it was.</p>

<p>He was too weary to sit, just as he was too tired to
find sleep easily most nights&mdash;his bones ached with it&mdash;so he went to stand
in front of the fireplace. Winds gusting across the chimney top made the flames
dance on the split logs and sometimes let a small puff of smoke into the room,
and he could hear the rain drumming away at the windows, but the thunder seemed
to have moved on. Maybe the storm was ending. Clasping his hands behind his
back, he turned away from the fire. &ldquo;What did the Elders say, Loial?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instead of answering straightaway, Loial looked at Min
as if seeking encouragement or support. Perched on the edge of a blue armchair
with her knees crossed, she smiled at the Ogier and nodded, and he sighed
heavily, a wind gusting through deep caverns. &ldquo;Karldin and I visited every <em>stedding</em>,
Rand. All but <em>Stedding</em> Shangtai, of course. I couldn&rsquo;t go there, but
I left a message everywhere we went, and Daiting isn&rsquo;t far from Shangtai.
Someone will carry it there. The Great Stump is meeting in Shangtai, and that
will attract crowds. This is the first time a Great Stump has been called in a
thousand years, not since you humans fought the War of the Hundred Years, and
it was Shangtai&rsquo;s turn. They must be considering something very important, but
no one would tell me why it was called. They won&rsquo;t tell you about any Stump
until you have a beard,&rdquo; he muttered, fingering a narrow patch of stubble on
his broad chin. Apparently, he intended to remedy his lack, though it was not
certain that he could. Loial was over ninety years old, now, yet for an Ogier,
that was still a boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Elders?&rdquo; Rand asked patiently. You had to be
patient with Loial, with any Ogier. They did not see time the way humans did&mdash;who among humans would think of whose <em>turn</em> it was after a thousand
years?&mdash;and Loial tended to go on at length, given half a chance. Great
length.</p>

<p>Loial&rsquo;s ears twitched, and he gave Min another look,
received another encouraging smile in return. &ldquo;Well, as I said, I visited all
the <em>stedding</em> but Shangtai. Karldin wouldn&rsquo;t go inside. He&rsquo;d rather sleep
every night under a bush than be cut off from the Source for a minute.&rdquo; Rand
did not say a word, but Loial raised his hands from his knees, palms out. &ldquo;I am
getting to the point, Rand. I am. I did what I could, but I don&rsquo;t know whether
it was enough. The <em>stedding</em> in the Borderlands told me to go home and
leave matters to older and wiser heads. So did Shadoon and Mardoon, in the
mountains on the Shadow Coast. The other <em>stedding</em> agreed to guard the
Waygates. I don&rsquo;t think they really believe there&rsquo;s any danger, but they
agreed, so you know they will keep a close guard. And I&rsquo;m sure someone will
take word to Shangtai. The Elders in Shangtai never liked having a Waygate
right outside the <em>stedding.</em> I must have heard Elder Haman say a hundred
times that it was dangerous. I know they&rsquo;ll agree to have it watched.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand nodded slowly. Ogier never lied, or at least the
few who made the attempt were so poor at it that they seldom tried a second
time. An Ogier&rsquo;s word was taken as seriously as anyone else&rsquo;s sworn oath. The
Waygates would be guarded closely. Except for those in the Borderlands, and in
the mountains south of Amadicia and Tarabon. From gate to gate, a man could
journey from the Spine of the World to the Aryth Ocean, from the Borderlands to
the Sea of Storms, all in a strange world somehow outside of time, or maybe
alongside it. Two days walking along the Ways could carry you a hundred miles,
or five hundred, depending on the paths you chose. And if you were willing to risk
the dangers. You could die very easily in the Ways, or worse. The Ways had
turned dark and corrupted long ago. Trollocs did not care about that, though,
at least not when they had Myrddraal driving them. Trollocs cared only for
killing, especially when they had Myrddraal driving them. And nine Waygates
would remain unwatched, with the danger that any of them might open up to let
out Trollocs by the tens of thousands. Setting any sort of guard without the <em>stedding</em>&rsquo;s
cooperation might be impossible. Many people did not believe Ogier existed,
and few of those who did wanted to meddle without leave. Maybe the Asha&rsquo;man, if
he had enough he could trust.</p>

<p>Suddenly, he realized that he was not the only one who
was tired. Loial looked worn and gaunt. His coat was rumpled and hung loosely
on him. It was dangerous for an Ogier to be outside the <em>stedding</em> too
long, and Loial had left his home a good five years ago. Maybe those brief
visits over the last few months had not been enough for him. &ldquo;Maybe you should
go home now, Loial. <em>Stedding</em> Shangtai is a only a few days from here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial&rsquo;s chair creaked alarmingly as he sat bolt
upright. His ears shot upright, too, in alarm. &ldquo;My mother will be there, Rand.
She&rsquo;s a famous Speaker. She would never miss a Great Stump.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t have come all the way back from the Two Rivers already,&rdquo; Rand
told him. Loial&rsquo;s mother was supposedly a famous walker, too, yet there were
limits, even for Ogier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know my mother,&rdquo; Loial muttered, a drum
booming darkly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll still have Erith in tow, too. She will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min leaned toward the Ogier, a dangerous light in her eyes. &ldquo;The way you
talk about Erith, I know you want to marry her, so why do you keep running from
her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand studied her from the fireplace. Marriage. Aviendha assumed that he
would marry her, and Elayne and Min as well, in the Aiel fashion. Elayne
appeared to think so, too, strange as that seemed. He thought she did. What did
Min think? She had never said. He should never have let them bond him. The bond
would smother them in grief when he died.</p>

<p>Loial&rsquo;s ears trembled with caution, now. Those ears were one reason
Ogier made poor liars. He made placating gestures as though Min were the larger
of them. &ldquo;Well, I do want to, Min. Of course I do. Erith is beautiful, and
very perceptive. Did I ever tell you how carefully she listened to me explain
about&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Of course I did. I tell everybody I meet. I do want to marry
her. But not yet. It isn&rsquo;t like with you humans, Min. You do everything Rand
asks. Erith will expect me to settle down and stay home. Wives never let a
husband go anywhere or do anything, if it means leaving the <em>stedding</em> for
more than a few days. I have my book to finish, and how can I do that if I
don&rsquo;t see everything Rand does? I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s done all sorts of things since I
left Cairhien, and I know I&rsquo;ll never get it all down right. Erith just wouldn&rsquo;t
understand. Min? Min, are you angry with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What makes you think I&rsquo;m angry?&rdquo; she said coolly.</p>

<p>Loial sighed heavily, and so clearly in relief that Rand almost stared.
Light, the Ogier actually thought she meant she was not angry! Rand knew he was
feeling his way in the dark when it came to women, even Min&mdash;maybe especially
Min&mdash;but Loial had better learn a lot more than he already knew before he
married his Erith. Otherwise, she would skin him out like a sick goat. Best to
get him out of the room before Min did Erith&rsquo;s job for her. Rand cleared his
throat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think on it overnight, Loial,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll
change your mind by morning.&rdquo; Part of him hoped Loial would. The Ogier had been
too long from home. Another part of him, though&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He could use Loial, if
what Alivia had told him about the Seanchan was true. Sometimes, he disgusted
himself. &ldquo;In any case, I need to talk to Bashere, now. And Logain.&rdquo; His mouth
tightened around the name. What <em>was</em> Logain doing in Asha&rsquo;man black?</p>

<p>Loial did not stand. Indeed, his expression grew more
troubled, ears slanting back and eyebrows drooping. &ldquo;Rand, there&rsquo;s something I
need to tell you. About the Aes Sedai who came with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lightnings flared anew outside the windows as he went
on, and the thunder crashed overhead harder than ever. With some storms, a lull
only meant the worst was coming.</p>

<p><em>I told
you to kill them all when you had the chance</em>, Lews Therin laughed. <em>I
told you.</em></p>

<br>

<p class="drop">&ldquo;Are you <em>positive</em> they&rsquo;ve been bonded,
Samitsu?&rdquo; Cadsuane asked firmly. And loudly enough to be heard over the thunder
booming on the manor house&rsquo;s rooftop. Thunder and lightning fit her mood. She
would have liked to snarl. It required a goodly measure of her training and
experience to sit calmly and sip hot ginger tea. She had not let emotion get
the upper hand in a very long time, but she wanted to bite something. Or
someone.</p>

<p>Samitsu held a porcelain cup of tea, too, but she had yet to swallow a drop,
and she had ignored Cadsuane&rsquo;s offer of a chair. The slender sister turned from
peering into the flames of the left-hand fireplace, the bells in her dark hair
jingling as she shook her head. She had not bothered to dry her hair properly,
and it hung damp and heavy down her back. Her hazel eyes were uneasy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
hardly the sort of question I could ask a sister, now is it, Cadsuane, and they
certainly didn&rsquo;t tell me. As who would? At first, I thought maybe they had done
like Merise and Corele. And poor Daigian.&rdquo; A brief wince of sympathy crossed
her face. She knew in full the pain that was gnawing at Daigian over her loss.
Any sister beyond her first Warder knew that too well. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s plain Toveine
and Gabrelle are both with Logain. I think Gabrelle is bedding him. If there&rsquo;s
bonding been done, it was the men who did it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Turnabout,&rdquo; Cadsuane muttered into her tea. Some said
that turnabout was fair play, but she had never believed in fighting fair.
Either you fought, or you did not, and it was never a game. Fairness was for
people standing safely to one side, talking while others bled. Unfortunately,
there was little she could do beyond trying to find a way to balance events.
Balance was not at all the same as fairness. What a dog&rsquo;s dinner this was turning
into. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you gave me at least a little warning before I have to face
Toveine and the others, but I want you to return to Cairhien the first thing
tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was nothing I could do, Cadsuane,&rdquo; Samitsu said bitterly. &ldquo;Half
the people I gave an order had begun checking with Sashalle to see if it was
right, and the other half told me to my face she&rsquo;d already said different. Lord
Bashere talked her into turning the Warders loose&mdash;I have no idea how he found
out about them in the first place&mdash;and she talked Sorilea into it, and there
wasn&rsquo;t the least thing I could do to stop it. Sorilea was behaving as if I had
just abdicated! She doesn&rsquo;t understand, and she made it plain she thinks I&rsquo;m a
fool. There&rsquo;s no point at all in me going back, unless you expect me to carry
Sashalle&rsquo;s gloves for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I expect you to watch her, Samitsu. No more than that. I want to know
what one of these Dragonsworn sisters does when neither I nor the Wise Ones are
looking over their shoulders and holding a switch. You&rsquo;ve always been very
observant.&rdquo; Patience was not always her strongest trait, but sometimes it was
required with Samitsu. The Yellow <em>was</em> observant, and intelligent, and
strong-willed most of the time, not to mention the best alive at Healing&mdash;at
least until the appearance of Damer Flinn&mdash;but she could suffer the most
astonishing collapses in her confidence. The stick never worked with Samitsu,
but pats on the back did, and it was ridiculous not to use what worked. As
Cadsuane reminded her how intelligent she was, how skilled at Healing&mdash;that
was always necessary, with Samitsu; she could go into a depression over
failing to Heal a dead man&mdash;how clever, the Arafellin sister began to draw up
her composure. And her self-assurance. &ldquo;You can be assured Sashalle won&rsquo;t
change her stockings without I know it,&rdquo; she said crisply. In truth, Cadsuane
expected no less.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if you don&rsquo;t mind me asking,&rdquo; with her confidence restored,
Samitsu&rsquo;s tone made that the merest courtesy; she was no shrinking flower
except when her self-assurance weakened, &ldquo;why are you here, at the back end of
Tear? What&rsquo;s young al&rsquo;Thor going to do? Or should I say, what are you going to
have him do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He intends something very dangerous,&rdquo; Cadsuane replied. Lightning
flashed outside the windows, sharp silver forks in a sky near as dark as night.
She knew exactly what he intended. She just did not know whether to stop it.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">&ldquo;It has to end!&rdquo; Rand thundered, echoed by the crashes in the sky. He
had doffed his coat before this interview, and rolled up his shirtsleeves to
bare the Dragons twined around his forearms in scarlet and gold, the
golden-maned heads resting on the backs of his hands. He wanted the man in
front of him reminded with every look that he was facing the Dragon Reborn. But
his hands were fists, to keep him from giving in to Lews Therin&rsquo;s urgings and
throttling bloody Logain Ablar. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need a war with the White Tower, and
you bloody Asha&rsquo;man bloody well won&rsquo;t give me a war with the White Tower! Do I
make myself understood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Logain, hands resting easily atop the long hilt of his sword, did not
flinch. He was a big man, if smaller than Rand, with a steady gaze that gave no
sign that he had been dressed down or called to account. The silver sword and
red-and-gold Dragon glittered brightly in the lamplight on the high collar of
his black coat, and that itself looked freshly ironed. &ldquo;Are you saying release
them?&rdquo; he asked calmly. &ldquo;Will the Aes Sedai release those of ours they&rsquo;ve
taken?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Rand said curtly. And sourly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s done can&rsquo;t be undone.&rdquo;
Merise had been so shocked when he suggested she release Narishma, you would
have thought he was asking her to abandon a puppy by the side of the road. And
he suspected Flinn would fight as hard to hang on to Corele as she to him; he was
fairly certain there was more between those two than the bond, now. Well, if an
Aes Sedai could bond a man who channeled, what was to say a pretty woman could
not fix on a gimpy old man? &ldquo;You realize the mess you&rsquo;ve created, though,
don&rsquo;t you? As it is, the only man who can channel that Elaida wants alive is
me, and that only till the Last Battle is done. Once she learns of this, she&rsquo;ll
be twice as hot to see you all dead any way she can manage it. I don&rsquo;t know how
the other lot will react, but Egwene was always a sharp bargainer. I may have
to tell off Asha&rsquo;man for Aes Sedai to bond until they have as many of you as
you do of them. That&rsquo;s if they don&rsquo;t just decide you all have to die as soon as
they can arrange it, too. What&rsquo;s done is done, but there cannot be any more!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Logain stiffened a little more with every word, but
his gaze held on Rand&rsquo;s. It was plain as horns on a ram that he was ignoring
the others in the sitting room. Min had wanted no part of this meeting and
taken herself off to read; Rand could not make up from down in Herid Fel&rsquo;s
books, but she found them fascinating. He had insisted Loial remain, though,
and the Ogier was pretending to study the flames in the fireplace. Except when
he glanced at the door, tufted ears twitching, as if wondering whether he could
slip out unnoticed under cover of the storm. Davram Bashere appeared even
shorter than he really was alongside the Ogier, a graying man with dark tilted
eyes, a beak of a nose, and thick mustaches curving down around his mouth. He
had worn his sword, too, a shorter blade than Logain&rsquo;s, and serpentine. Bashere
spent more time peering into his winecup than looking at anything else, but
whenever his eyes touched Logain, he unconsciously ran a thumb along his sword
hilt. Rand thought it was unconscious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Taim gave the order,&rdquo; Logain said, coldly uncomfortable explaining
himself in front of an audience. Sudden lightning close to the house cast his
face in lurid shadows for an instant, a bleak mask of darkness. &ldquo;I assumed it
came from you.&rdquo; His eyes moved slightly in Bashere&rsquo;s direction, and his mouth
tightened. &ldquo;Taim does a great many things people think are at your direction,&rdquo;
he went on reluctantly, &ldquo;but he has his own plans. Flinn and Narishma and
Manfor are on the deserters&rsquo; list, like every Asha&rsquo;man you kept with you. And
he has a coterie of twenty or thirty he keeps close and trains privately. Every
man who wears the Dragon is one of that group except me, and he&rsquo;d have kept the
Dragon from me, if he dared. No matter what you&rsquo;ve done, it is time to turn
your eyes to the Black Tower before Taim splits it worse than the White Tower
is. If he does, you&rsquo;ll find the larger part is loyal to him, not you. They know
him. Most have never even seen you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Irritably, Rand pushed his sleeves down and dropped into a chair. What
he had done made no matter to Logain. The man knew <em>saidin</em> was clean, but
he could not believe Rand or any man had actually done the cleansing. Did he
think the Creator had decided to stretch out a merciful hand after three
thousand years of suffering? The Creator had made the world and then left
humankind to make of it what they would, a heaven or the Pit of Doom by their
choosing. The Creator had made many worlds, watched each flower or die, and
gone on to make endless worlds beyond. A gardener did not weep for each blossom
that fell.</p>

<p>For an instant, he thought those must have been Lews
Therin&rsquo;s reflections. He had never gone on that way about the Creator or
anything else that he recalled. But he could <em>feel</em> Lews Therin nodding
in approval, a man listening to someone else. Still, it was not the kind of
thing he would have considered before Lews Therin. How much space remained
between them?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Taim will have to wait,&rdquo; he said wearily. How long
could Taim wait? He was surprised not to hear Lews Therin raging for him to
kill the man. He wished that made him feel easier. &ldquo;Did you just come to see
that Logain reached me safely, Bashere, or to tell me somebody stabbed
Dobraine? Or do you have an urgent task for me, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bashere raised an eyebrow at Rand&rsquo;s tone, and his jaw tightened as he
glanced at Logain, but after a moment, he snorted so hard his thick mustaches
should have shaken. &ldquo;Two men ransacked my tent,&rdquo; he said, setting his winecup
down on a carved blue table against the wall, &ldquo;one carrying a note I could
swear I wrote myself if I didn&rsquo;t know better. An order to carry away &lsquo;certain
items.&rsquo; Loial tells me the fellows who knifed Dobraine had the same sort of
note, apparently in Dobraine&rsquo;s hand. A blind man could see what they were after,
with a little thought. Dobraine and I are the most likely candidates to be
guarding the seals for you. You have three, and you say three are broken. Maybe
the Shadow knows where the last is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial had turned from the fireplace as the Saldaean spoke, his ears
rigid, and now he burst out, &ldquo;That <em>is</em> serious, Rand. If someone breaks
all the seals on the Dark One&rsquo;s prison, or maybe even just one or two more, the
Dark One could break free. Even you can&rsquo;t face the Dark One! I mean, I know the
Prophecies say you will, but that has to be just a way of speaking.&rdquo; Even
Logain looked concerned, his eyes studying Rand as if measuring him against
the Dark One.</p>

<p>Rand leaned back in his chair, careful not to let his tiredness show.
The seals on the Dark One&rsquo;s prison on one hand, Taim splitting the Asha&rsquo;man on
the other. Was the seventh seal already broken? Was the Shadow beginning the
opening moves of the Last Battle? &ldquo;You told me something once, Bashere. If your
enemy offers you two targets&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strike at a third,&rdquo; Bashere finished promptly, and
Rand nodded. He had already decided, anyway. Thunder rattled the windows till
the casements shook. The storm was strengthening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t fight the Shadow and the Seanchan at the same
time. I am sending the three of you to arrange a truce with the Seanchan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bashere and Logain seemed stunned into silence. Until
they began to argue, one on top of the other. Loial just looked ready to faint.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Elza fidgeted, listening to Fearil report what had
occurred since she left him in Cairhien. It was not the man&rsquo;s harsh voice that
irritated her. She hated lightning, and wished she could ward away the violent
lights flashing in the windows as she had warded her room against
eavesdropping. No one would think her wish for privacy strange, since she had
spent twenty years convincing everyone that she was married to the pale-haired
man. Despite his voice, Fearil looked the sort a woman would marry, tall and
lean and quite pretty. The hard edge to his mouth only made his face more so,
really. Of course, some might think it peculiar that she had never had more
than one Warder at a time, if they stopped to think about it. A man with just
the right qualifications was difficult to find, but perhaps she should start
looking. Lightning lit up the windows again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, enough,&rdquo; she broke in finally. &ldquo;You did the
right thing, Fearil. It would have been taken as odd if you were the only one
to refuse to find your Aes Sedai.&rdquo; A sense of relief flashed through the bond.
She was strict about obedience to her orders, and while he knew she could not
kill him&mdash;would not, at least&mdash;punishment only required her to mask the bond
so she did not share his pain. That, and a ward to muffle his screams. She
disliked screaming almost as much as she disliked lightning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is just as well you&rsquo;re with me,&rdquo; she went on. A
pity that the Aiel savages were still holding Fera, though she would have to
quiz the White on exactly why she had sworn before she could be trusted. Until
the journey to Cairhien, she had not known she shared anything with Fera. A
very great pity that none of her own heart was with her, but only she had been
sent to Cairhien, and she did not question the orders she received any more
than Fearil questioned those she gave. &ldquo;I think a few people are going to have
to die soon.&rdquo; As soon as she decided which ones. Fearil bowed his head, and a
jolt of pleasure came through the bond. He did like killing. &ldquo;In the meanwhile,
you will kill anyone who threatens the Dragon Reborn. Anyone.&rdquo; After all, it
had become perfectly clear to her, while she herself was a captive of the
savages. The Dragon Reborn had to reach Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don, or how could the Great
Lord defeat him there?</p>
