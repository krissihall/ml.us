<h4><em>One Answer</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">P</span>evara waited with a touch of impatience while the
 slim little Accepted placed the rimmed silver tray on a side table and
 uncovered the dish of cakes. A short woman with a serious face, Pedra was not
 being laggard, or resentful over having to spend the morning fetching and
 carrying for a Sitter, just precise and careful. Those were useful qualities,
 to be encouraged. Still, when the Accepted asked whether she should pour the
 wine, Pevara said crisply, &ldquo;We will do for ourselves, child. You may wait in
 the anteroom.&rdquo; She almost told the young woman to go back to her studies.</p>

<p>Pedra spread her banded white skirts in a graceful curtsy without any
sign of being flustered the way Accepted often were when a Sitter showed
snappishness. All too frequently, Accepted took any bite in a Sitter&rsquo;s tone as
an opinion on their fitness for the shawl, as if Sitters had no other concerns.</p>

<p>Pevara waited until the door closed behind Pedra and the latch clicked
before nodding approvingly. &ldquo;That one will be raised Aes Sedai soon,&rdquo; she said.
It was satisfying when any woman attained the shawl, but especially when the
woman had appeared unpromising to begin with. Small pleasures seemed the only
ones available, these days.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not one of ours, though, I think&rdquo; was the reply from
her surprising guest, who turned from a study of the row of painted miniatures
of Pevara&rsquo;s dead family that stood in a line on the wave-carved marble mantel
above the fireplace. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s uncertain about men. I believe they make her
nervous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tarna certainly had never been nervous about men or
very much of anything else, at least not since she reached the shawl just over
twenty years ago. Pevara could remember a very jumpy novice, but the
pale-haired woman&rsquo;s blue eyes were steady as stones, now. And about as warm as
stones in winter. Even so, there was something in that cool prideful face,
something in the set of her mouth, that made her seem uneasy this morning.
Pevara could hardly imagine what might make Tarna Feir nervous.</p>

<p>The real question, though, was why the woman had come to see her. It
bordered on impropriety for her to visit any Sitter privately, particularly a
Red. Tarna still maintained her rooms here in the Red quarter, but so long as
she held her new position, she was no longer part of the Red Ajah despite the
crimson embroidery on her dark gray dress. Delaying the move to her new
apartment might be taken as a show of delicacy, by those who did not know her.</p>

<p>Anything out of the ordinary made Pevara wary since Seaine had pulled
her into hunting the Black Ajah. And Elaida trusted Tarna, just as she had
trusted Galina; it was wise to be very cautious with <em>anyone</em> Elaida
trusted. Just thinking of Galina&mdash;the Light burn the woman forever!&mdash;still
set Pevara&rsquo;s teeth on edge, but there was a second connection. Galina had taken
a special interest in Tarna as a novice, too. True, Galina had taken an interest
in any novice or Accepted she thought might join the Red, but it was another
reason for caution.</p>

<p>Not that Pavara let anything show on her face, of course.
She had been Aes Sedai too long for that. Smiling, she reached for the
long-necked silver pitcher that sat on the tray giving off the sweet scent of
spices. &ldquo;Will you take wine, Tarna, in congratulation for being raised?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silver goblets in hand, they settled on spiral-worked
armchairs, a style that had gone out of fashion in Kandor near a hundred years
ago, but one that Pevara liked. She saw no reason to change her furniture or
anything else according to the whims of the moment. The chairs had served her
since they were new-made, and they were comfortable with the addition of a few
cushions. Tarna sat stiffly, however, on the edge of her seat. No one had ever
called her languid, but clearly she <em>was</em> uneasy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not certain congratulations are in order,&rdquo; she said, fingering
the narrow red stole draped around her neck. The exact shade was not
prescribed, except that anyone who saw it must call the color red, and she had
chosen a brilliant scarlet that nearly shone. &ldquo;Elaida insisted, and I could not
refuse. Much has changed since I left the Tower, inside as well as out.
Alviarin made everyone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;watchful&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;of the Keeper. I suspect some will
want her birched, when she finally returns. And Elaida&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She paused to
sip at her wine, but when she lowered the goblet, she went on in a different
vein. &ldquo;I have often heard you called unconventional. I have even heard that you
once said you would like to have a Warder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been called worse than unconventional,&rdquo; Pevara said dryly. What
had the woman been about to say concerning Elaida? She sounded as though she
would have refused the Keeper&rsquo;s stole, given her wishes. Strange. Tarna was
hardly shy or shrinking. Silence seemed best. Especially about Warders. She had
been talking too much if <em>that</em> was general gossip. Besides, keep silent
long enough, and the other woman always spoke if only to fill up the gap. You
could learn a great deal through silence. She sipped her own wine slowly. There
was too much honey in it for her taste, and not enough ginger.</p>

<p>Still stiff, Tarna rose and strode to the fireplace, where she stood
staring at the miniatures sitting on their white lacquered stands. She raised a
hand to touch one of the ivory ovals, and Pevara felt her own shoulders tighten
in spite of herself. Georg, her youngest brother, had been only twelve when he
died, when all of the people in those paintings died, in an uprising by
Darkfriends. They had not been a family who could afford ivory miniatures, but
once she had the coin, she found a painter who could capture her memories. A
beautiful boy, Georg, tall for his years and utterly fearless. Long after the event, she had learned how her baby brother
died. With a knife in his hand, standing over their father&rsquo;s body and trying to
keep the mob from their mother. So many years ago, now. They would all have
been long dead in any case, and their children&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s children, as well.
But some hatreds never died.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Dragon Reborn is <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, so I have heard,&rdquo; Tarna said
finally, still staring at Georg&rsquo;s picture. &ldquo;Do you think he alters chance
everywhere? Or do we change the future by ourselves, one step following another
until we find ourselves somewhere we never expected?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Pevara said, a trifle more curtly
than she could have wished. She did not like the other woman peering at her
brother&rsquo;s image so intently while talking of a man who could channel, even if
he was the Dragon Reborn. She bit her lip so as not to tell Tarna to turn
around and look at her. You could not read someone&rsquo;s back the way you could a
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I anticipated no great difficulty in Salidar. No great success, either,
but what I found&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Was that a shake of her head, or had she merely
changed the angle at which she was peering at the miniature? She spoke slowly,
but with an undercurrent of remembered urgency. &ldquo;I left a pigeon-handler a day
outside the village, yet it took me less than half a day to get back to her,
and after I loosed the birds with copies of my report, I pressed on so hard I
had to pay the woman off because she could not keep up. I can hardly say how
many horses I went through. Sometimes, the animal was spent to the point I had
to show my ring to make a stable take it in trade, even with silver added. And
because I pressed so hard, I happened to reach a village in Murandy while a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;recruiting party&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;was there. If I had not been frightened out of my
wits for the Tower by what I saw in Salidar, I would have ridden to Ebou Dar
and taken ship for Illian and then upriver, but the thought of going south instead
of north, the thought of waiting for a vessel, sent me like an arrow toward Tar
Valon. So I was in that village to see them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who, Tarna?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Asha&rsquo;man.&rdquo; The woman did turn then. Her eyes were still blue ice, but
tight. She held her goblet in both hands as if trying to soak in the warmth. &ldquo;I
did not know what they were then, of course,
but they were openly recruiting men to follow the Dragon Reborn, and it seemed
wisest to listen before I spoke. Well for me that I did. There were six of
them, Pevara, six men in black coats. Two with silver swords on their collars
were feeling men out about whether they might like to learn to channel. Oh,
they did not say so right out. Wield the lightnings, they called it. Wield the
lightnings and ride the thunder. But it was clear enough to me, if not to the
fools they were talking to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; very well for you that you kept silent,&rdquo; Pevara said quietly.
&ldquo;Six men who can channel would be more than merely dangerous for a sister by
herself. Our eyes-and-ears are full of talk about these recruiting parties&mdash;they appear everywhere from Saldaea to Tear&mdash;but no one seems to have an idea
of how to stop them. If it isn&rsquo;t too late for that already.&rdquo; She very nearly
bit her lip again. That was the trouble with talking. Sometimes, you said more
than you wanted.</p>

<p>Oddly, the comment took some of the stiffness out of Tarna. She resumed
her seat, leaning back, though a hint of wariness still clung to the way she
held herself. She chose her words carefully, pausing to touch the wine to her
lips, but she did not actually drink, that Pevara saw. &ldquo;I had a long time to
think on the rivership coming north. Longer, after the fool captain ran us
aground so hard he broke a mast and put a hole in the hull. Days trying to hail
another ship, after we got ashore, and days finding a horse. Six of those men
sent to one village convinced me, finally. Oh, the district around, as well,
but it was not very populous. I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I believe it is too late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elaida thinks they can all be gentled,&rdquo; Pevara said noncommittally.
She had already exposed herself too much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When they can send six to one small village, and
Travel? There is only one answer I can see. We&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Tarna took a deep
breath, fingering the bright red stole again, but now it seemed more in regret
than to play for time. &ldquo;Red sisters must take them as Warders, Pevara.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was so startling that Pevara blinked. A hair less
self-control, and she would have gaped. &ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those icy blue eyes met her gaze steadily. The worst was past&mdash;the
unthinkable spoken aloud&mdash;and Tarna was a woman of stone once more. &ldquo;This is
hardly a matter for joking. The only other choice is to let them run loose. Who
else can do it? Red sisters are used to facing men like this, and ready to take
the necessary risks. Anyone else will flinch. Each sister will have to take
more than one, but Greens appear to manage well enough with that. I think the
Greens will faint if this is suggested to them, though. We&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Red sisters&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;must do what needs to be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you broached this to Elaida?&rdquo; Pevara asked, and Tarna shook her
head impatiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elaida believes as you said. She&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; The yellow-haired woman
frowned into her wine before going on. &ldquo;Elaida often believes what she wants to
believe and sees what she wants to see. I tried to bring up the Asha&rsquo;man the
first day I was back. Not to suggest bonding; not to her. I am not a fool. She
forbade me to mention them to her. But you are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;unconventional.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do you believe they can be gentled <em>after</em> they&rsquo;re
bonded? I have no idea what that would do to the sister holding the bond, and
in truth, I don&rsquo;t want to learn.&rdquo; She was the one playing for time, Pevara
realized. She had had no idea where this interview was headed when it began,
but she would have wagered everything she owned against it coming to this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That might be the end, and it might prove impossible,&rdquo; the other woman
replied coolly. The woman <em>was</em> stone. &ldquo;Either way, I can see no other way
to handle these Asha&rsquo;man. Red sisters must bond them as Warders. If there is
any way, I will be among the first, but it <em>must</em> be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sat there, calmly sipping her wine, and for a long time, Pevara
could only stare at her in consternation. Nothing Tarna had said proved she was
not Black Ajah, yet she could not distrust every sister unable to prove that.
Well, she could and did, when it came to matters of the Black, but there were
other matters she had to deal with. She was a Sitter, not simply a hunting dog.
She had the White Tower to think of, and Aes Sedai far from the Tower. And the
future.</p>

<p>Dipping her fingers into her embroidered belt pouch,
she drew out a small piece of paper rolled into a thin tube. It seemed to her
that it should glow with letters of fire. So far, she was one of two women in
the Tower who knew what was written there. Even once she had it out, she hesitated before handing it to Tarna. &ldquo;This came
from one of our agents in Cairhien, but it was sent by Toveine Gazal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tarna&rsquo;s eyes jerked to Pevara&rsquo;s face at the mention of Toveine&rsquo;s name,
then fell to reading again. Her stony face did not change even after she
finished and let the paper roll back into a tube in her hand. &ldquo;This changes
nothing,&rdquo; she said flatly. Coldly. &ldquo;It only makes what I suggest more urgent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; Pevara sighed. &ldquo;That changes everything. It changes
the whole world.&rdquo;</p>
