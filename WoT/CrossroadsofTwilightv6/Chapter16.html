<h4><em>The Subject of Negotiations</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he morning sun sat on the horizon, leaving the
 nearer side of Tar Valon still wrapped in shadows, but the snow that covered
 everything gleamed brightly. The city itself seemed to shine behind its long
 white walls, all bravely towered and bannered, yet to Egwene, sitting her
 roan gelding on the river-bank above the city, it seemed even farther away
 than it really was. The Erinin widened to more than two miles here, and the
 Alindrelle Erinin and Osendrelle Erinin, flowing to either side of the
 island, were almost half that, so that Tar Valon appeared to sit in the
 middle of a great lake, unreachable despite the massive bridges that stood
 high above the waters so that ships could sail beneath them easily. The White
 Tower itself, a thick bone-white shaft rising to an impossible height from
 the city&rsquo;s heart, filled her own heart with a yearning for home. Not for the
 Two Rivers, but for the Tower. That was her home, now. A plume of smoke
 caught her eye, a faint black line rising from the far bank beyond the city,
 and she grimaced. Daishar stamped a hoof in the snow, but a pat on the neck
 sufficed to soothe the roan. It would take more to soothe his rider.
 Homesickness was the smallest part of it. Minuscule, compared to the rest.</p>

<p>With a sigh, she rested her
 reins on the high pommel of her saddle and raised the long brass-bound
 looking glass. Her cloak fell back, slipping off one shoulder, but she
 ignored the cold that misted her breath and placed a gloved hand to shield
 the front lens against the sun&rsquo;s glare. The city walls leaped closer in her
 sight. She focused on the tall curving arms of Northharbor that pushed out
 into the upstream currents. People moved purposefully atop the battlements
 that enfolded the harbor, but she could barely discern men from women at
 that distance. Still, she was glad that she was not wearing her seven-striped
 stole, and that her face was deep within her cowl, just in case someone there
 had a stronger glass than she. The wide mouth of the man-made harbor was
 blocked by a massive iron chain drawn taut a few feet above the water. Tiny
 dots on the water, diving birds fishing in front of the harbor, gave the
 chain scale. One single pace-long link would have required two men to lift
 it. A rowboat might slip under that barrier, but no vessel of any size would
 enter unless the White Tower allowed. Of course, the chain was only intended
 to keep out enemies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There they are, Mother,&rdquo; Lord Gareth murmured, and she lowered the
glass. Her general was a stocky man in a plain breastplate worn over a plain
brown coat, without any touch of gilt or embroidery anywhere. His face was
bluff and weathered behind the bars of his helmet, and the years had given him
a strange sort of comforting calmness. All you need do was look at Gareth Bryne
to know that if the Pit of Doom opened in front of him, he would smother his
fear and go about doing what needed doing. And other men would follow him. He
had proved on battlefield after battlefield that following him was the path to
victory. A good man to have following her. Her eyes followed his gauntleted
hand, pointing upriver.</p>

<p>Just coming in sight around a point of land, five, six&mdash;no, seven&mdash;riverships were slicing furrows down the Erinin. Large vessels
as such things were seen on the river, one with three masts, their triangular
sails stood out tight, and their long sweeps cut hard through the blue-green
water to add a little more speed. Everything about the craft spoke of a burning
desire for speed, a desire to reach Tar Valon <em>now!</em> The river was deep
enough here that ships could run within shouting distance of the banks in
places, but these sailed in almost single file as close to the middle of the
Erinin as the steersmen could manage and hold the wind. Sailors clinging to the
mastheads kept watch along the shoreline, and not for mudbanks.</p>

<p>In fact, they had nothing at all to fear so long as they kept out of
bowshot. True, from where she sat her horse, she could have set fire to every
one of those ships, or simply cut holes through their hulls and let them sink.
The work of moments. Yet doing so surely meant some of those aboard would
drown. The currents were strong, the water like ice, and the swim to shore
long, for those who actually could swim. Even one death would make what she did
using the Power as a weapon. She was trying to live as though already bound by
the Three Oaths, and the Oaths protected those vessels from her or any other
sister. A sister who had sworn on the Oath Rod would not be able to <em>make</em> herself
set those weaves, perhaps not even to form them, unless she could convince
herself she was in immediate danger from the ships. But neither captains nor
crews believed that, apparently.</p>

<p>As the riverships came closer, shouts thinned threadbare by distance
drifted across the water. The lookouts up on the masts pointed to her and
Gareth, and it quickly became apparent they took her for an Aes Sedai with her
Warder. Or at least, the captains were unwilling to take the chance she was
not. After a moment, the beat of the sweeps increased. Only by a fraction, but
the oarsmen labored to find that fraction. A woman on the quarterdeck of the
lead vessel, likely the captain, waved her arms as if demanding still more
effort, and a handful of men began running up and down the deck, tightening
this line or loosening that to change the angle of the sails, though Egwene
could not see that they achieved anything. There were men on those decks other
than sailors, and most of those crowded to the railings, a handful raising
looking glasses of their own. Some seemed to be measuring the distance left to
cover before they reached the safety of the harbor.</p>

<p>She thought about weaving a flare, a starburst of light, perhaps with a
loud bang, just above each of the vessels. That would certainly let anyone
aboard with brains realize that neither speed nor distance kept them safe here,
only a forbearance born of the Three Oaths. They should know that they
were safe <em>because</em> of Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>Exhaling
heavily, she shook her head and mentally upbraided herself. That simple weave
would also attract attention in the city, certainly more than the appearance
of a single sister. Sisters often came to the riverbank to stare at Tar Valon
and the Tower. Even if the only reaction to her flares was some sort of
counterdisplay, once begun, that sort of contest could be very difficult to put
a stop to. Once begun, matters might well escalate out of hand. There were too
many opportunities for that, as it was, the more so these last five days.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The
harbormaster hasn&rsquo;t let above eight or nine ships in at one time since we
arrived,&rdquo; Gareth said as the first vessel drew abreast of them, &ldquo;but the
captains seemed to have worked out the timing. Another clutch will appear soon,
and reach the city about the time the Tower Guards are sure these fellows
actually came to enlist. Jimar Chubain knows enough to guard against me
sneaking men in aboard ships. He has more of the Guards crowded into the harbors
than anywhere except at the bridge towers, and not many anywhere else, so far
as I can learn. That will change, though. The flow of ships starts at first light
and keeps up till near nightfall, here and at Southharbor too. This lot doesn&rsquo;t
seem to be carrying as many soldiers as most do. Every plan is brilliant until
the day comes, Mother, but then you must adapt to circumstances or be ridden
down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene
made a vexed sound. There must be two hundred or more passengers altogether on
those seven ships. A few might be merchants or traders or some other sort of
innocent traveler, but the low sun glittered off helmets and breastplates and
steel discs sewn to leather jerkins. How many shiploads arrived each day?
Whatever the number, a steady flow was pouring into the city to enlist under
High Captain Chubain. &ldquo;Why do men always rush so hard to kill or be killed?&rdquo;
she muttered irritably.</p>

<p>Lord
Gareth looked at her calmly. He sat his horse, a big bay gelding with a white
stripe down his nose, like a statue. Sometimes, she thought she knew one small
part of how Siuan felt about the man. Sometimes she thought it would be worth
whatever effort was needed to startle him, just to see him startled.</p>

<p>Unfortunately,
she knew the answer to her own question as well as he did. At least as it
applied to men going soldiering. Oh, there
were men enough who rushed to support a cause or defend what they thought what
was right, and some who sought adventure, whatever they believed that was, yet
the simple fact was that for carrying a pike or spear, a man could earn twice
each day what he would get for walking behind another man&rsquo;s plow, and half
again as much if he could ride well enough to join the cavalry. Crossbowmen and
archers fell in between. The man who worked for another could dream of having
his own farm or shop one day, or a beginning toward one that his sons could
build on, but he surely had heard a thousand tales of men soldiering for five
years or ten and coming home with enough gold to set themselves up in comfort,
tales of ordinary men who rose to become generals, or lords. For a poor man,
Gareth had said bluntly, staring down the point of a pike could be a better
view than the hind end of somebody else&rsquo;s plow horse. Even if he was far more
likely to die from the pike than earn fame or fortune. A bitter way to look at
it, yet she imagined that was how most of those men on the ships saw matters,
too. But then, that was how she had gotten her own army. For every man who
wanted to see the usurper pulled from the Amyrlin Seat, for every man who even
knew for certain who Elaida was, ten if not a hundred had joined for the pay.
Some of the men on the ship were raising their hands, to show the guards on the
harbor walls they were not holding weapons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, and Lord Gareth sighed. His voice remained calm, but his
words were hardly comforting when he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, so long as the harbors remain open, Tar Valon will eat better
than we do, and rather than growing weaker with hunger, the Tower Guard will
grow larger and stronger. I very much doubt that Elaida will let Chubain rush
out to attack us, as much as I wish he would. Every day you wait only adds to
the butcher&rsquo;s bill we&rsquo;ll have to pay sooner or later. I&rsquo;ve said from the start
it will come to an assault, in the end, and that hasn&rsquo;t changed, but everything
else has. Have the sisters put me and my men inside the walls now, and I can
take Tar Valon. It won&rsquo;t be clean. It never is. But I can take the city for
you. And fewer will die than if you delay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A knot formed in her belly, twisted tight till she could hardly breathe.
Carefully, step by step, she performed novice exercises to make it loosen. The
bank contained the river, guiding without controlling. Calm settled on her, in
her.</p>

<p>Too many people had begun seeing the uses of gateways,
and in a way, Gareth represented the worst. His business was war, and he was
very good at it. As soon as he learned a gateway could take more than a small
group of people at one time, he had seen the implications. Even the great walls
of Tar Valon, beyond the range of any siege catapult not on a barge, and worked
with the Power till the largest catapult could not mark them in any case, might
as well be made of paper against an army that could Travel. But whether Gareth
Bryne had learned or not, other men would seize on that idea. The Asha&rsquo;man
already had, it seemed. War had always been ugly, yet it was going to grow
uglier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;I know people are going to die
before this is over.&rdquo; The Light help her, she could see them dying just by closing
her eyes. Even more would die if she made the wrong decisions, though, and not
just here. &ldquo;But I have to keep the White Tower alive&mdash;against Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don&mdash;to stand between the world and the Asha&rsquo;man&mdash;and the Tower will die if this
comes to sisters killing one another in the streets of Tar Valon.&rdquo; That had
already happened once. It could not be allowed a second time. &ldquo;If the White
Tower dies, hope dies. I shouldn&rsquo;t have to tell you that again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Daishar snorted and tossed his head, lunging as though
he had sensed her irritation, but she reined him in firmly and slipped the
looking glass into the tooled leather case hanging from her saddle. The diving
birds gave up their fishing and sprang into the air as the thick chain that
blocked Northharbor began to droop. It would dip beneath the surface well
before the first ship reached the harbor mouth. How long ago had it been that
she reached Tar Valon by that same route? Almost beyond memory, it seemed. An
Age gone. It had been another woman who came ashore and was met by the Mistress
of Novices.</p>

<p>Gareth shook his head with a quick grimace. But then,
he never gave up, did he? &ldquo;You have to keep the White Tower alive, Mother, but
my job is to give it to you. Unless things have changed that I don&rsquo;t know
about. I can see sisters whispering and looking over their shoulders even if I
don&rsquo;t know what it means. If you still want the Tower, it will come to an assault,
better soon than late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly the morning seemed darker, as though clouds
had obscured the sun. Whatever she did, the dead were going to pile up like
cordwood, but she had to keep the White Tower alive. She had to. When there
were no good choices, you had to choose the one that seemed least wrong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen enough here,&rdquo; she said quietly. With one last glance at that
narrow line of smoke beyond the city, she turned Daishar toward the trees a
hundred paces back from the river, where her escort waited among the evergreen
leatherleaf and winter-bare beech and birch.</p>

<p>Two hundred light cavalry, in boiled leather
breastplates or coats covered with metal discs, would certainly have attracted
notice appearing on the riverbank, but Gareth had convinced her of the
necessity of these men with their slender lances and short horsebows. Without
any doubt, that smoke plume on the far bank rose from burning wagons or
supplies. Pinpricks, yet those pinpricks came every night, sometimes one,
sometimes two or three, till everyone looked for smoke first thing on rising.
Hunting the raiders down had proved impossible, so far. Sudden snow squalls
flared around the pursuers, or fierce freezing night winds, or the tracks
simply vanished abruptly, the snow beyond the last hoof-print as smooth as
fresh fallen. The residues of weavings made it plain enough they were being
aided by Aes Sedai, and there was no point in taking a chance that Elaida had
men and maybe sisters on this side of the river, too. Few things could please Elaida
more than getting her hands on Egwene al&rsquo;Vere.</p>

<p>They were not her whole escort, of course. Besides Sheriam, her Keeper,
she had ridden out with six more Aes Sedai this morning, and those who had
Warders had brought them, so behind the sister eight men waited in
color-shifting cloaks that rippled in queasy-making fashion when a breeze
caught them and otherwise made parts of riders and horses seem to vanish into
the tree trunks. Aware of the dangers&mdash;from raiders, at least&mdash;aware that
their Aes Sedai were wound tight to near breaking, they watched the surrounding
copse as though the cavalrymen were not there. The safety of their own Aes
Sedai was their primary concern, and that they trusted to no one else. Sarin, a
black-bearded stump of a man, not that short but very wide, stayed so close to
Nisao that he seemed to loom over the diminutive Yellow, and Jori managed to
loom over Morvrin as well, though he was actually shorter than she. As broad as
Sarin, but very short even for a Cairhienin. Myrelle&rsquo;s three Warders, the three
she dared acknowledge, clustered around her until she could not have moved her
horse without pushing one of theirs out of her way. Anaiya&rsquo;s Setagana, lean and
dark and as beautiful as she was plain, almost managed to surround her by himself,
and Tervail, with his bold nose and scarred face, did the same with Beonin.
Carlinya had no Warder, not unusual for a White, but she studied the men from
the depths of her fur-lined cowl as if thinking about finding one.</p>

<p>Not too long ago, Egwene would have hesitated to be
seen with those six women. They and Sheriam had all sworn fealty to her, for
various reasons, and neither they nor she wanted the fact known or even
suspected. They had been her way to influence events, to the extent that she could,
when everyone thought her no more than a figurehead, a girl Amyrlin the Hall of
the Tower could use as it wished and no one listened to. The Hall had lost that
illusion when she brought them to declare war on Elaida, finally admitting what
they had been about since the day they had fled the Tower in the first place,
but that only made the Hall, and the Ajahs, worry over what she would do next
and try to figure out how to make sure that whatever it was met with their
approval. The Sitters had been very surprised when she accepted their suggestion
of a council, one sister from each Ajah, to advise her with their wisdom and
experience. Or perhaps they thought her success with the declaration of war had
gone to her head. Of course, she had just told Morvrin and Anaiya and the
others to make sure they were the sisters chosen, and they retained enough
prestige within their Ajahs to manage it, just. She had been listening to their
advice, if not always taking it, for weeks by that time, but now there was no
longer any need to arrange furtive meetings or pass messages in secret.</p>

<p>It seemed, however, that there had been an addition to the party while
Egwene was staring at the Tower.</p>

<p>Sheriam, wearing the narrow blue stole of her office outside her cloak,
managed a very formal bow from her saddle. The flame-haired woman could be
incredibly formal at times. &ldquo;Mother, the Sitter Delana wishes to speak with
you,&rdquo; she said as if Egwene could not see the stout Gray sister sitting there
on a dappled mare almost as dark as Sheriam&rsquo;s black-footed mount. &ldquo;On a matter
of some importance, so she says.&rdquo; And the slight touch of asperity meant Delana
had not told her what matter. Sheriam would not have liked that. She could be
very jealous of her position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In private, if you please, Mother,&rdquo; Delana said, pushing back her dark
hood to reveal hair nearly the color of silver. Her voice was deep for a
woman&rsquo;s, but it hardly carried the urgency of someone with important matters to
speak of.</p>

<p>Her presence was something of a surprise. Delana often supported Egwene
in the Hall of the Tower, when Sitters were quibbling over whether a
particular decision actually concerned the war against Elaida. That meant the
Hall was required to support Egwene&rsquo;s commands as if they had stood with the
greater consensus, and even the Sitters who had stood for war did not half
like that little fact, which made for endless quibbling. They wanted to pull
Elaida down, yet left to themselves, the Hall would have done nothing but
argue. Truth to tell, though, Delana&rsquo;s support was not always welcome. One day
she could be the very image of a Gray negotiator seeking consensus, and the
next so strident in her arguments that every Sitter within hearing got her
back up. She had been known to set the cat among the pigeons in other ways,
too. No fewer than three times now, she had demanded the Hall make a formal
declaration that Elaida was Black Ajah, which inevitably led to an awkward
silence until someone called for the sitting to be adjourned. Few were willing
to discuss the Black Ajah openly. Delana would discuss anything, from how they
were to find proper clothes for nine hundred and eighty-seven novices to
whether Elaida had secret supporters among the sisters, another topic that gave
most sisters a case of the prickles. Which left the question of why she had
ridden out so early, and by herself. She had never approached Egwene before
without another Sitter or three for company. Delana&rsquo;s pale blue eyes gave away
no more than did her smooth Aes Sedai face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While we ride,&rdquo; Egwene told her. &ldquo;We will want a little privacy,&rdquo; she
added when Sheriam opened her mouth. &ldquo;Stay back with the others, please.&rdquo; The
Keeper&rsquo;s green eyes tightened in what might almost have been anger. An
efficient Keeper, and eager with it, she had pinned her hopes on Egwene and
made little secret that she disliked being excluded from any meeting Egwene
had. Upset or not, she bowed her head in acceptance with only a small hesitation.
Sheriam had not always known which of them commanded, but she did now.</p>

<p>The land tended upward from the River Erinin, not in
hills but simply rising toward the monstrous peak that loomed to the west, so
massive it seemed to mock the name mountain. Dragonmount would have towered
above everything else even in the Spine of the World; in the relatively flat
country around Tar Valon, its white-capped crest seemed to reach the heavens,
especially when a thin thread of smoke was streaming away from the jagged top
as it was now. A thin thread at that height would be something else entirely,
close at hand. Trees gave out less than halfway up Dragonmount, and no one had
ever succeeded in reaching the crest or even coming close, though it was said
the slopes were littered with the bones of those who had tried. Why anyone
would try in the first place, no one could quite explain. Sometimes the long
evening shadow of the mountain stretched all the way to the city. People who
lived in the region were accustomed to Dragonmount dominating the sky, much as
they were accustomed to the White Tower looming above the city walls and
visible for miles. Both were unchanging fixtures that had always been there and
always would be, but crops and crafts occupied the people&rsquo;s lives, not
mountains or Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>In tiny hamlets of ten or a dozen stone houses roofed
in thatch or slate, and the occasional village of a hundred, children playing
in the snow or carrying buckets of water from the wells stopped to gape at the
soldiers riding along the dirt tracks that passed for roads when not covered in
snow. They carried no banners, but a few of the soldiers wore the Flame of Tar
Valon worked on their cloaks or coatsleeves, and the Warders&rsquo; strange cloaks
named at least some of the women as Aes Sedai. Even this near the city, sisters
had been an uncommon sight till recently, and they were still something to make
a child&rsquo;s eyes gleam. But then, the soldiers themselves probably came close in
the list of marvels. The farms that fed Tar Valon covered most of the land,
stone-walled fields surrounding sprawling houses and tall barns of stone or
brick, with copses and coppices and thickets of trees between, and groups of
farm children often ran a little distance parallel to the line of travel,
leaping across the snow like hares. Winter chores kept most older folk indoors,
but those who ventured out, heavily bundled against the cold, spared barely a
glance for soldiers or Warders or Aes Sedai. Spring would be coming soon, and
the plowing and planting, and what Aes Sedai did would not affect that. The
Light willing, it would not.</p>

<p>There was no point to guards unless they rode as if
expecting an attack, and Lord Gareth had arranged a strong party of foreriders
and lines of flankers, with trailers riding to the rear while he led the mass
of the soldiers right behind the Warders who followed closely on the heels of
Sheriam and the &ldquo;council.&rdquo; They all made a large, lopsided ring around Egwene,
and she could almost imagine she was riding through the countryside alone with
Delana if she did not look around too closely. Or if she looked beyond. Instead
of pressing the Gray Sitter to speak&mdash;it was a long ride back to camp, and no
one was allowed to weave a gateway where the weave might be observed; there was
plenty of time to hear what Delana had to say&mdash;Egwene compared the farms they
passed to those in the Two Rivers.</p>

<p>Perhaps the realization that the Two Rivers was no longer home made her
study them. Acknowledging the truth could never be a betrayal, yet she needed
to remember the Two Rivers. You could forget who you were if you forgot where
you came from, and sometimes the innkeeper&rsquo;s daughter from Emond&rsquo;s Field seemed
a stranger to her. Any of these farms would have looked decidedly odd, set down
near Emond&rsquo;s Field, though she could not put a finger on why, exactly. A
different shape to the houses, a different slant to the roofs. And more often
slate topped a house than thatch, here, when you could make out either through
the snow that was often mounded on the rooftops. Of course, there was less
thatch and more stone and brick in the Two Rivers now than there had been. She
had seen it, in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod.</em> Change came so slowly you never noticed
it creeping up on you, or far too fast for comfort, but it came. Nothing stayed
the same, even when you thought it did. Or hoped it would.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some think you&rsquo;re going to bond him your Warder,&rdquo; Delana said suddenly
in a quiet voice. She might have been engaging in casual conversation. Her
whole attention seemed to be on arranging the hood of her cloak with
green-gloved hands. She rode well, blending with the motion of her mare so
effortlessly that she appeared unaware of the animal. &ldquo;Some think perhaps you
already have. I haven&rsquo;t had one myself for some time, but just knowing your
Warder is there can be a comfort. If you choose the right one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene raised an eyebrow&mdash;she was proud that she did
not gape at the woman; this was the very <em>last</em> topic she would have
expected&mdash;and Delana added, &ldquo;Lord Gareth. He spends a great deal of time with
you. He&rsquo;s rather older than is usual, but Greens often choose a more
experienced man for their first. I know you never actually had an Ajah, yet I
often think of you as a Green. I wonder, will Siuan be relieved if you bond
him, or upset? Sometimes I think one, sometimes the other. Their relationship,
if it can be called that, is most peculiar, yet she seems completely
unembarrassed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must ask Siuan herself about that.&rdquo; Egwene&rsquo;s
smile had some bite in it. So did her tone, for that matter. She did not
entirely understand herself why Gareth Bryne had offered her his loyalty, but
the Hall of the Tower had better uses for its time than gossiping like village
women. &ldquo;You can tell whoever you choose that I&rsquo;ve bonded no one, Delana. Lord
Gareth spends time with me, as you put it, because I am the Amyrlin and he is
my general. You may remind them of that, as well.&rdquo; So Delana thought of her as
a Green. That was the Ajah she would have chosen, though in truth, she wanted
only one Warder. But Gawyn was either inside Tar Valon or else on his way to
Caemlyn, and either way, she would not lay hands on him soon. She patted
Daishar&rsquo;s neck unnecessarily and tried to keep her smile from becoming a glare.
It had been pleasant to forget the Hall, among other things, for a while. The
Hall made her understand why Siuan had so often looked like a bear with a sore
tooth when she was Amyrlin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say it has become a matter for wide
discussion,&rdquo; Delana murmured. &ldquo;So far. Still, there is some interest in whether
you will bond a Warder, and who. I doubt that Gareth Bryne would be considered
a wise pick.&rdquo; She twisted in her saddle to look behind them. At Lord Gareth,
Egwene thought, but when the Sitter turned back around, she said, very softly,
&ldquo;Sheriam was never your choice for Keeper, of course, but you must know that
the Ajahs set the rest of that lot to watch you, as well.&rdquo; Her dappled gray
mare was shorter than Daishar, so she had to look up at Egwene, which she tried
to do without seeming to. Those watery blue eyes were suddenly quite sharp.
&ldquo;There was some thought that Siuan might be advising you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;too well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;after the way you brought about the declaration of war against Elaida. But
she&rsquo;s still resentful over her changed circumstances, isn&rsquo;t she? Sheriam is
seen as the most likely culprit, now. In any case, the Ajahs want a little
warning if you decide to pull another surprise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you for the warning,&rdquo; Egwene said politely. Culprit? She had
proven to the Hall that she would not be their puppet, yet most insisted on
thinking she had to be someone&rsquo;s. At least no one suspected the truth about her
council. It was to be hoped no one did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is another reason you should be wary,&rdquo; Delana
went on, the intensity in her eyes belying the casualness of her voice. This
was more important to her than she wanted Egwene to know. &ldquo;You may be sure that
any advice one of them gives you comes straight from the head of her Ajah, and
as you know, the head of an Ajah and its Sitters don&rsquo;t always see eye to eye.
Listening too closely could put you at odds with the Hall. Not every decision
concerns the war, remember, but you will surely want some of those to go your
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An Amyrlin should listen to every side before making
any decision,&rdquo; Egwene replied, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll remember your warning when they advise
me, Daughter.&rdquo; Did Delana think she was a fool? Or perhaps the woman was trying
to make her angry. Anger made for hasty decisions and rash words that sometimes
were hard to take back. She could not imagine what Delana was aiming at, but
when Sitters could not manipulate her one way, they tried another. She had
gotten a great deal of practice in sidestepping manipulation since being raised
Amyrlin. Taking deep, regular breaths, she sought the balance of calm and found
it. She had entirely too much practice at that, too, of late.</p>

<p>The Gray looked up at her past the edge of her hood,
her face utterly smooth. But her pale blue eyes were <em>very</em> sharp, now,
like augers. &ldquo;You might inquire what they think on the subject of negotiations
with Elaida, Mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene almost smiled. The pause had been very
deliberate. Apparently Delana disliked being called Daughter by a woman younger
than most novices. Younger than most who had come from the Tower, let alone the
newest. But then, Delana herself was too young to be a Sitter. And she could
not hold her temper as well as the innkeeper&rsquo;s daughter. &ldquo;And why would I ask
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because the subject has come up in the Hall in the
last few days. Not as a proposal, but it has been mentioned, very quietly, by
Varilin, and by Takima, and also by Magla. And Faiselle and Saroiya have
appeared interested in what they have had to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Calm or no calm, a worm of anger suddenly writhed inside Egwene, and
crushing it was no easy task. Those five had been Sitters before the Tower was
broken, but more importantly, they were divided between the two major factions
struggling for control of the Hall. In reality, they were divided between
following Romanda or Lelaine, yet that pair would oppose one another if it
meant they both drowned. They also kept an iron grip on their followers.</p>

<p>She might believe the others had been panicked by
events, but not Romanda or Lelaine. For half a week now, talk of Elaida or
retaking the Tower had been all but overwhelmed by worried conversations over
that impossibly powerful, impossibly long eruption of the Power. Nearly
everyone wanted to know what had caused it, and nearly everyone was afraid to
learn. Only yesterday had Egwene been able to convince the Hall that it must be
safe for a small party to Travel to where that eruption had been&mdash;even the
memory was strong enough for everyone to pinpoint exactly where it had been&mdash;and most sisters still seemed to be holding their collective breath until
Akarrin and the others returned. Every Ajah had wanted a representative, but
Akarrin had been the only Aes Sedai to push forward.</p>

<p>Neither Lelaine nor Romanda seemed concerned, however. Violent and
prolonged as the display had been, it also had been very far away, and no harm
done that they could see; if it was the Forsaken&rsquo;s work, as seemed certain, the
chance of learning anything was vanishingly small, and the possibility that
they could do anything to counter it even smaller. Wasting time and effort on
impossibilities was senseless when an important task lay right in front of
them. So they said, gritting their teeth over finding themselves in agreement.
They did agree that Elaida must be stripped of the stole and staff, though,
Romanda with almost as much fervor as Lelaine, and if Elaida unseating a former
Blue as Amyrlin had enraged Lelaine, Elaida&rsquo;s proclamation that the Blue Ajah
was disbanded had made her near-rabid. If they were allowing talk of
negotiation&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;It made no sense.</p>

<p>The last thing Egwene wanted was for Delana or anyone
else to suspect that Sheriam and the others were more than a set of sheepdogs
set to watch her, but she summoned them with a sharp call. They were smart
enough to keep the secrets that needed keeping, since their own Ajahs would
have their hides if even the half came out, and with no great haste, they came
forward and rode in a cluster around her, their faces all masks of Aes Sedai
serenity and patience. Then Egwene told Delana to repeat what she had said. For
all her initial request for privacy, the Gray made only a perfunctory demurral
before complying. And that was the end of calm and patience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s madness,&rdquo; Sheriam said before anyone else could open her mouth.
She sounded angry, and perhaps a little frightened. Well she might be. Her name
was on a list of those marked for stilling. &ldquo;None of them can really believe
negotiation is possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should hardly think so,&rdquo; Anaiya put in dryly. Her
plain face belonged on a farmwife rather than a Blue sister, and she dressed
very simply, publicly at least, in good wool, but she handled her bay gelding
as easily as Delana did her mare. Very little could ruffle Anaiya&rsquo;s calm. Of
course, there was no Blue among the Sitters talking negotiation. Anaiya looked
an unlikely soldier, but for Blues, this was war to the knife, no quarter asked
or given. &ldquo;Elaida has made the situation quite clear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elaida is irrational,&rdquo; Carlinya said with a toss of
her head that made her cowl fall to her shoulders and shook her short dark
curls. She pulled the hood back into place irritably. Carlinya seldom showed
any hint of emotion, yet her pale cheeks were nearly as flushed as Sheriam&rsquo;s,
and heat filled her voice. &ldquo;She cannot possibly believe that we will all come
crawling back to her now. How can Saroiya believe she will accept anything
less?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crawling is what Elaida has demanded, though,&rdquo;
Morvrin muttered acridly. Her usually placid round face wore a sour expression,
too, and her plump hands were tight on her reins. She scowled so hard at a
flight of magpies, scattering from a stand of birch trees at the passage of
horses, that it seemed they should fall out of the sky. &ldquo;Takima likes the sound
of her own voice, sometimes. She <em>must</em> be talking to hear herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faiselle must, too,&rdquo; Myrelle said darkly, glaring at Delana as though
she were to blame. The olive-skinned woman was known for her temper, even among
Greens. &ldquo;I never expected to hear that sort of talk out of her. She&rsquo;s never
been a fool before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe Magla really means any such thing,&rdquo; Nisao insisted,
peering at each of them in turn. &ldquo;She just can&rsquo;t. For one thing, as much as I
hate to say it, Romanda has Magla so tight under her thumb that Magla squeaks
whenever Romanda sneezes, and the only doubt Romanda has is whether Elaida
should be birched before she&rsquo;s exiled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Delana&rsquo;s expression was so bland, she had to be
suppressing a smug smile. Plainly, this was exactly the reaction she had hoped
for. &ldquo;Romanda holds Saroiya and Varilin just as firmly, and Takima and Faiselle
hardly put one foot in front of the other without Lelaine&rsquo;s permission, but
they still said what they said. I think your advisors are closer to the
feelings of most sisters, though, Mother.&rdquo; Smoothing her gloves, she gave
Egwene a sidelong look. &ldquo;You may be able to nip this in the bud, if you move
firmly. It seems you will have the support you need from the Ajahs. And mine,
of course, in the Hall. Mine, and enough more to stop it dead.&rdquo; As if Egwene
needed support to accomplish that. Perhaps she was trying to ingratiate
herself. Or just to make it appear that support of Egwene was her only concern.</p>

<p>Beonin had been riding in silence, clutching her cloak
around her and peering at a spot between her brown mare&rsquo;s ears, but suddenly
she shook her head. Ordinarily, her large blue-gray eyes made her appear
startled, but they peered from her hood in a blaze of anger as she glared from
one of her companions to another, including Egwene. &ldquo;Why should negotiations be
out of the question?&rdquo; Sheriam blinked at her in surprise, and Morvrin opened
her mouth with a scowl, but Beonin plunged on, directing her ire at Delana,
now, her Taraboner accent stronger than usual. &ldquo;We are Gray, you and I. We
negotiate, mediate. Elaida, she has stated the conditions most onerous, but
that is often the case in the beginning of negotiations. We can reunite the
White Tower and assure the safety of everyone, if we only talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We also judge,&rdquo; Delana snapped, &ldquo;and Elaida has been
judged.&rdquo; That was not precisely true, but she seemed more startled than anyone
else by Beonin&rsquo;s outburst. Her voice dripped acid. &ldquo;Perhaps you are willing to
negotiate yourself into being birched. I am not, and I think you will find few
others who are, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The situation, it has altered,&rdquo; Beonin persisted. She stretched a hand
toward Egwene, almost pleading. &ldquo;Elaida would not have made the proclamation
she did concerning the Dragon Reborn unless she had him in hand, one way or
another. That flare of <em>saidar</em> was a warning. The Forsaken must be
moving, and the White Tower, it must be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; Egwene cut in. &ldquo;You are willing to open
negotiations with Elaida? With the Sitters still in the Tower?&rdquo; she amended.
Elaida would never talk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Beonin said fervently. &ldquo;Matters can be arranged
to everyone&rsquo;s satisfaction. I know they can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you have my permission.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Immediately everyone but Beonin began talking frantically on top of one
another, trying to dissuade her, telling her this was insanity. Anaiya shouted
as loudly as Sheriam, gesturing emphatically, and Delana&rsquo;s eyes bulged in what
looked like near terror. Some of the outriders began looking toward the sisters
as much as they watched the farms they were riding past, and there was a stir
among the Warders, who certainly had no need of their bonds at the moment to
know their Aes Sedai were agitated, but they held their places. Wise men kept
their noses out of the way when Aes Sedai began raising their voices.</p>

<p>Egwene ignored the shouts and arm-waving. She had considered every
possibility she could think of for ending this struggle with the White Tower
whole and united. She had talked for hours with Siuan, who had more reason than
anyone to want to unseat Elaida. If it could have saved the Tower, Egwene would
have surrendered to Elaida, forget whether the woman had come to the Amyrlin
Seat legally. Siuan had nearly had apoplexy at the suggestion, yet she had
agreed, reluctantly, that preserving the Tower superseded every other
consideration. Beonin wore such a beautiful smile, it seemed a crime to quench
it.</p>

<p>Egwene raised her voice just enough to be heard over
the others. &ldquo;You will approach Varilin and the others Delana named, and
arrange to approach the White Tower. These are the terms I will accept: Elaida
is to resign and go into exile.&rdquo; Because Elaida would never accept back the
sisters who had rebelled against her. An Amyrlin had no say over how an Ajah
governed itself, but Elaida had declared that the sisters who fled the Tower
were no longer members of any Ajah. According to her, they would have to beg
readmittance to their Ajahs, after serving a penance under her direct control.
Elaida would not reunite the Tower, only shatter it worse than it already was.
&ldquo;Those are the only terms I will accept, Beonin. The <em>only</em> terms. Do you
understand me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beonin&rsquo;s eyes rolled up in her head, and she would have fallen from her
horse if Morvrin had not caught her, muttering under her breath as she held the
Gray upright and slapped her face, not lightly. Everyone else stared at Egwene
as though they had never seen her before. Even Delana, who must have planned
for something like this to happen from the first word she had said. They had
come to a halt with Beonin&rsquo;s fainting fit, and the ring of soldiers around
them drew up at a shouted command from Lord Gareth. Some stared toward the Aes
Sedai, their anxiety plain even with their faces hidden behind the bars of
their helmets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to get back to camp,&rdquo; Egwene said. Calmly. What had to be
done had to be done. Perhaps surrender would have healed the Tower, but she
could not believe it. And now it might come down to Aes Sedai facing one
another in the streets of Tar Valon, unless she could find a way to make her
plan succeed. &ldquo;We have work to do,&rdquo; she said, gathering her reins, &ldquo;and there
isn&rsquo;t much time left.&rdquo; She prayed there was enough.</p>
