<h4><em>More Tales of the Wheel</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">A</span>n
itchy restlessness had Rand pacing beside the
dining table. Twelve strides. The table was exactly twelve strides
long no matter how many times he stepped it off. Irritably he made
himself stop keeping tally. <em>Stupid thing to be doing. I don&rsquo;t
care how long the bloody table is</em>. A few minutes later he
discovered that he was counting the number of trips he made up the
table and back. <em>What</em> is <em>he saying to Moiraine and Lan?
Does he know why the Dark One is after us? Does he know</em> which
<em>of us the Dark One wants?</em></p>

<p>He glanced at his friends. Perrin had crumbled a
piece of bread and was idly pushing the crumbs around on the table
with one finger. His yellow eyes stared unblinking at the crumbs,
but they seemed to see something far off. Mat slouched in his
chair, eyes half closed and the beginnings of a grin on his face.
It was a nervous grin, not amusement. Outwardly he looked like the
old Mat, but from time to time he unconsciously touched the Shadar
Logoth dagger through his coat. <em>What is Fain telling her? What
does he know?</em></p>

<p>Loial, at least, did not look worried. The Ogier was
studying the walls. First he had stood in the middle of the room
and stared, turning slowly in a circle; now he was almost pressing
his broad nose against the stone while he gently traced a
particular join with fingers thicker than most men&rsquo;s thumbs.
Sometimes he closed his eyes, as if the feeling was more important
than seeing. His ears gave an occasional twitch, and he muttered to
himself in Ogier, appearing to have forgotten anyone else was in
the room with him.</p>

<p>Lord Agelmar stood talking quietly with Nynaeve and
Egwene in front of the long fireplace at the end of the room. He
was a good host, adept at making people forget their troubles;
several of his stories had Egwene in giggles. Once even Nynaeve
threw back her head and roared with laughter. Rand gave a start at
the unexpected sound, and jumped again when Mat&rsquo;s chair crashed to
the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blood and ashes!&rdquo; Mat growled, ignoring the way
Nynaeve&rsquo;s mouth tightened at his language. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s taking her so
long?&rdquo; He righted his chair and sat back down without looking at
anyone. His hand strayed to his coat.</p>

<p>The Lord of Fal Dara looked at Mat disapprovingly&mdash;his gaze took in Rand and Perrin without any improvement&mdash;then turned back to the women. Rand&rsquo;s pacing had taken him
close to them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; Egwene was saying, as glibly as if she had
been using titles all of her life, &ldquo;I thought he was a Warder, but
you call him Dai Shan, and talk about a Golden Crane banner, and so
did those other men. Sometimes you sound almost as if he&rsquo;s a king.
I remember once Moiraine called him the last Lord of the Seven
Towers. Who is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve began studying her cup intently, but it was
obvious to Rand that abruptly she was listening even more closely
than was Egwene. Rand stopped and tried to overhear without seeming
to eavesdrop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord of the Seven Towers,&rdquo; Agelmar said with a
frown. &ldquo;An ancient title, Lady Egwene. Not even the High Lords of
Tear have older, though the Queen of Andor comes close.&rdquo; He heaved
a sigh, and shook his head. &ldquo;He will not speak of it, yet the story
is well known along the Border. He is a king, or should have been,
al&rsquo;Lan Mandragoran, Lord of the Seven Towers, Lord of the Lakes,
crownless King of the Malkieri.&rdquo; His shaven head lifted high, and
there was a light in his eye as if he felt a father&rsquo;s pride. His
voice grew stronger, filled with the force of his feeling. The
whole room could hear without straining. &ldquo;We of Shienar call
ourselves Bordermen, but fewer than fifty years ago, Shienar was
not truly of the Borderlands. North of us, and of Arafel, was
Malkier. The lances of Shienar rode north, but it was Malkier that
held back the Blight. Malkier, Peace favor her memory, and the
Light illumine her name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lan is from Malkier,&rdquo; the Wisdom said softly,
looking up. She seemed troubled.</p>

<p>It was not a question, but Agelmar nodded. &ldquo;Yes, Lady
Nynaeve, he is the son of al&rsquo;Akir Mandragoran, last crowned King of
the Malkieri. How did he become as he is? The beginning, perhaps,
was Lain. On a dare, Lain Mandragoran, the King&rsquo;s brother, led his
lances through the Blight to the Blasted Lands, perhaps to Shayol
Ghul itself. Lain&rsquo;s wife, Breyan, made that dare for the envy that
burned her heart that al&rsquo;Akir had been raised to the throne instead
of Lain. The King and Lain were as close as brothers could be, as
close as twins even after the royal &lsquo;al&rsquo; was added to Akir&rsquo;s name,
but jealousy wracked Breyan. Lain was acclaimed for his deeds, and
rightfully so, but not even he could outshine al&rsquo;Akir. He was, man
and king, such as comes once in a hundred years, if that. Peace
favor him, and el&rsquo;Leanna.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lain died in the Blasted Lands with most of those
who followed him, men Malkier could ill afford to lose, and Breyan
blamed the King, saying that Shayol Ghul itself would have fallen
if al&rsquo;Akir had led the rest of the Malkieri north with her husband.
For revenge, she plotted with Cowin Gemallan, called Cowin
Fairheart, to seize the throne for her son, Isam. Now Fairheart was
a hero almost as well loved as al&rsquo;Akir himself, and one of the
Great Lords, but when the Great Lords had cast the rods for king,
only two separated him from Akir, and he never forgot that two men
laying a different color on the Crowning Stone would have set him
on the throne instead. Between them, Cowin and Breyan moved
soldiers back from the Blight to seize the Seven Towers, stripping
the Borderforts to bare garrisons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Cowin&rsquo;s jealousy ran deeper.&rdquo; Disgust tinged
Agelmar&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Fairheart the hero, whose exploits in the Blight
were sung throughout the Borderlands, was a Darkfriend. With the
Borderforts weakened, Trollocs poured into Malkier like a flood.
King al&rsquo;Akir and Lain together might have rallied the land; they
had done so before. But Lain&rsquo;s doom in the Blasted Lands had shaken
the people, and the Trolloc invasion broke men&rsquo;s spirit and their
will to resist. Too many men. Overwhelming numbers pushed the
Malkieri back into the heartland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Breyan fled with her infant son Isam, and was run
down by Trollocs as she rode south with him. No one knows their
fate of a certainty, but it can be guessed. I can find pity only
for the boy. When Cowin Fairheart&rsquo;s treachery was revealed and he
was taken by young Jain Charin&mdash;already called Jain
Farstrider&mdash;when Fairheart was brought to the Seven Towers in
chains, the Great Lords called for his head on a pike. But because
he had been second only to al&rsquo;Akir and Lain in the hearts of the
people, the King faced him in single combat and slew him. Al&rsquo;Akir
wept when he killed Cowin. Some say he wept for a friend who had
given himself to the Shadow, and some say for Malkier.&rdquo; The Lord of
Fal Dara shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first peal of the doom of the Seven Towers had
been struck. There was no time to gather aid from Shienar or
Arafel, and no hope that Malkier could stand alone, with five
thousand of her lances dead in the Blasted Lands, her Borderforts
overrun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Al&rsquo;Akir and his Queen, el&rsquo;Leanna, had Lan brought to
them in his cradle. Into his infant hands they placed the sword of
Malkieri kings, the sword he wears today. A weapon made by Aes
Sedai during the War of Power, the War of the Shadow that brought
down the Age of Legends. They anointed his head with oil, naming
him Dai Shan, a Diademed Battle Lord, and consecrated him as the
next King of the Malkieri, and in his name they swore the ancient
oath of Malkieri kings and queens.&rdquo; Agelmar&rsquo;s face hardened, and he
spoke the words as if he, too, had sworn that oath, or one much
similar. &ldquo;To stand against the Shadow so long as iron is hard and
stone abides. To defend the Malkieri while one drop of blood
remains. To avenge what cannot be defended.&rdquo; The words rang in the
chamber.</p>

<p>&ldquo;El&rsquo;Leanna placed a locket around her son&rsquo;s neck, for
remembrance, and the infant, wrapped in swaddling clothes by the
Queen&rsquo;s own hand, was given over to twenty chosen from the King&rsquo;s
Bodyguard, the best swordsmen, the most deadly fighters. Their
command: to carry the child to Fal Moran.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then did al&rsquo;Akir and el&rsquo;Leanna lead the Malkieri out
to face the Shadow one last time. There they died, at Herot&rsquo;s
Crossing, and the Malkieri died, and the Seven Towers were broken.
Shienar, and Arafel, and Kandor, met the Halfmen and the Trollocs
at the Stair of Jehaan and threw them back, but not as far as they
had been. Most of Malkier remained in Trolloc hands, and year by
year, mile by mile, the Blight has swallowed it.&rdquo; Agelmar drew a
heavyhearted breath. When he went on, there was a sad pride in his
eyes and voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only five of the Bodyguards reached Fal Moran alive,
every man wounded, but they had the child unharmed. From the cradle
they taught him all they knew. He learned weapons as other children
learn toys, and the Blight as other children their mother&rsquo;s garden.
The oath sworn over his cradle is graven in his mind. There is
nothing left to defend, but he can avenge. He denies his titles,
yet in the Borderlands he is called the Uncrowned, and if ever he
raised the Golden Crane of Malkier, an army would come to follow.
But he will not lead men to their deaths. In the Blight he courts
death as a suitor courts a maiden, but he will not lead others to
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you must enter the Blight, and with only a few,
there is no man better to take you there, nor to bring you safely
out again. He is the best of the Warders, and that means the best
of the best. You might as well leave these boys here, to gain a
little seasoning, and put your entire trust in Lan. The Blight is
no place for untried boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat opened his mouth, and shut it again at a look
from Rand. <em>I wish he&rsquo;d learn to keep it shut</em>.</p>

<p>Nynaeve had listened just as wide-eyed as Egwene, but
now she was staring into her cup again, her face pale. Egwene put a
hand on her arm and gave her a sympathetic look.</p>

<p>Moiraine appeared in the doorway, Lan at her heels.
Nynaeve turned her back on them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; Rand demanded. Mat rose, and
Perrin, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Country oaf,&rdquo; Agelmar muttered, then raised his
voice to a normal tone. &ldquo;Did you learn anything, Aes Sedai, or is
he simply a madman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is mad,&rdquo; Moiraine said, &ldquo;or close to it, but
there is nothing simple about Padan Fain.&rdquo; One of the
black-and-gold-liveried servants bowed his way in with a blue
washbasin and pitcher, a bar of yellow soap, and a small towel on a
silver tray; he looked anxiously at Agelmar. Moiraine directed him
to put them on the table. &ldquo;Your pardon for commanding your
servants, Lord Agelmar,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I took the liberty of asking
for this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Agelmar nodded to the servant, who put the tray on
the table and left hurriedly. &ldquo;My servants are yours to command,
Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The water Moiraine poured into the basin steamed as
if only just off the boil. She pushed up her sleeves and began
vigorously washing her hands without regard for the heat of the
water. &ldquo;I said he was worse than vile, but I did not come close. I
do not believe I have ever met someone so abject and debased, yet
at the same time so foul. I feel soiled from touching him, and I do
not mean for the filth on his skin. Soiled in here.&rdquo; She touched
her breast. &ldquo;The degradation of his soul almost makes me doubt he
has one. There is something worse to him than a Darkfriend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He looked so pitiful,&rdquo; Egwene murmured. &ldquo;I remember
him arriving in Emond&rsquo;s Field each spring, always laughing and full
of news from outside. Surely there&rsquo;s some hope for him? &lsquo;No man can
stand in the Shadow so long that he cannot find the Light again,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
she quoted.</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai toweled her hands briskly. &ldquo;I have
always believed it so,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Perhaps Padan Fain can be
redeemed. But he has been a Darkfriend more than forty years, and
what he has done for that, in blood and pain and death, would
freeze your heart to hear. Among the least of these&mdash;though
not small to you, I suspect&mdash;he brought the Trollocs to
Emond&rsquo;s Field.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Rand said softly. He heard Egwene gasp. <em>I
should have guessed. Burn me, I should have, as soon as I
recognized him</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he bring any here?&rdquo; Mat asked. He looked at the
stone walls around them and shivered. Rand thought he was
remembering the Myrddraal more than Trollocs; walls had not stopped
the Fade at Baerlon, or at Whitebridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he did&rdquo;&mdash;Agelmar laughed&mdash;&ldquo;they&rsquo;ll
break their teeth on the walls of Fal Dara. Many others have
before.&rdquo; He was speaking to everyone, but obviously addressing his
words to Egwene and Nynaeve, from the glances he gave them. &ldquo;And do
not worry yourself about Halfmen, either.&rdquo; Mat&rsquo;s face reddened.
&ldquo;Every street and alley in Fal Dara is lit by night. And no man may
hide his face inside the walls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why would Master Fain do that?&rdquo; Egwene asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three years ago&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; With a heavy sigh Moiraine
sat down, folding up as if what she had done with Fain had drained
her. &ldquo;Three years, this summer. As far back as that. The Light
surely favors us, else the Father of Lies would have triumphed
while I still sat planning in Tar Valon. Three years, Fain has been
hunting you for the Dark One.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s crazy!&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s come into the Two
Rivers every spring as regular as a clock. Three years? We&rsquo;ve been
right there in front of him, and he never looked at any of us twice
before last year.&rdquo; The Aes Sedai pointed a finger at him, fixing
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fain told me everything, Rand. Or almost everything.
I believe he managed to hold back something, something important,
despite all I could do, but he said enough. Three years ago, a
Halfman came for him in a town in Murandy. Fain was terrified, of
course, but it is considered a very great honor among Darkfriends
to be so summoned. Fain believed he had been chosen for great
things, and he had, though not in the manner he believed. He was
brought north to the Blight, to the Blasted Lands. To Shayol Ghul.
Where he met a man with eyes of fire, who named himself
Ba&rsquo;alzamon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat shifted uneasily, and Rand swallowed hard. It had
to have been that way, of course, but that did not make it any
easier to accept. Only Perrin looked at the Aes Sedai as if nothing
could surprise him any longer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light protect us,&rdquo; Agelmar said fervently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fain did not like what was done to him at Shayol
Ghul,&rdquo; Moiraine continued calmly. &ldquo;While we talked, he screamed
often of fire and burning. It almost killed him, bringing it all
out from where he had it hidden. Even with my Healing he is a
shattered ruin. It will take much to make him whole again. I will
make the effort, though, if for no other reason than to learn what
more he still hides. He had been chosen because of where he did his
peddling. No,&rdquo; she said quickly when they stirred, &ldquo;not the Two
Rivers only, not then. The Father of Lies knew roughly where to
find what he sought, but not much better than we in Tar Valon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fain said he has been made the Dark One&rsquo;s hound, and
in a way he is right. The Father of Lies set Fain to hunt, first
changing him so he could carry out that hunt. It is the things done
to bring about those changes that Fain fears to remember; he hates
his master for them as much as he fears him. So Fain was sent
sniffing and hunting through all the villages around Baerlon, and
all the way to the Mountains of Mist, and down to the Taren and
across into the Two Rivers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three springs ago?&rdquo; Perrin said slowly. &ldquo;I remember
that spring. Fain came later than usual, but what was strange was
that he lingered on. A whole week he remained, idle and gnashing
his teeth about laying out money for a room at the Winespring Inn.
Fain likes his money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember, now,&rdquo; Mat said. &ldquo;Everybody was wondering
was he sick, or had he fallen for a local woman? Not that any of
them would marry a peddler, of course. As well marry one of the
Traveling People.&rdquo; Egwene raised an eyebrow at him, and he shut his
mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After that, Fain was taken to Shayol Ghul again, and
his mind was&mdash;distilled.&rdquo; Rand&rsquo;s stomach turned over at the
tone in the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s voice; it told more of what she meant than
the grimace that flashed across her face. &ldquo;What he had&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;sensed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;was concentrated and fed back. When he entered the Two Rivers
the next year, he was able to choose his targets out more clearly.
Indeed, more clearly even than the Dark One had expected. Fain knew
for a certainty that the one he sought was one of three in Emond&rsquo;s
Field.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin grunted, and Mat began cursing in a soft
monotone that even Nynaeve&rsquo;s glare did not stop. Agelmar looked at
them curiously. Rand felt only the faintest chill, and wondered at
it. Three years the Dark One had been hunting him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;hunting
them. He was sure it should have made his teeth chatter.</p>

<p>Moiraine did not allow Mat to interrupt her. She
raised her voice enough to be heard over him. &ldquo;When Fain returned
to Lugard, Ba&rsquo;alzamon came to him in a dream. Fain abased himself
and performed rites that would strike you deaf to hear the half of
them, binding himself even more tightly to the Dark One. What is
done in dreams can be more dangerous than what is done awake.&rdquo; Rand
stirred at the sharp, warning look, but she did not pause. &ldquo;He was
promised great rewards, power over kingdoms after Ba&rsquo;alzamon&rsquo;s
victory, and told that when he returned to Emond&rsquo;s Field he was to
mark the three he had found. A Halfman would be there, waiting for
him with Trollocs. We know now how the Trollocs came to the Two
Rivers. There must have been an Ogier grove and a Waygate at
Manetheren.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The most beautiful of all,&rdquo; Loial said, &ldquo;except for
Tar Valon.&rdquo; He had been listening as intently as everyone else.
&ldquo;Manetheren is remembered fondly by the Ogier.&rdquo; Agelmar formed the
name silently, his eyebrows raised in wonder. Manetheren.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord Agelmar,&rdquo; Moiraine said, &ldquo;I will tell you how
to find the Waygate of Mafal Dadaranell. It must be walled up and a
guard set, and none allowed near. The Halfmen have not learned all
of the Ways yet, but that Waygate is to the south and only hours
from Fal Dara.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Lord of Fal Dara gave himself a shake, as if he
were coming out of a trance. &ldquo;South? Peace! We don&rsquo;t need that, the
Light shine on us. It shall be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Fain follow us through the Ways?&rdquo; Perrin asked.
&ldquo;He must have done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine nodded. &ldquo;Fain would follow you three into
the grave, because he must. When the Myrddraal failed at Emond&rsquo;s
Field, it brought Fain with the Trollocs on our trail. The Fade
would not let Fain ride with him; although he thought he should
have the best horse in the Two Rivers and ride at the head of the
band, the Myrddraal forced him to run with the Trollocs, and the
Trollocs to carry him when his feet gave out. They talked so that
he could understand, arguing about the best way to cook him when
his usefulness was done. Fain claims he turned against the Dark One
before they reached the Taren. But sometimes his greed for his
promised rewards seeps into the open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When we had escaped across the Taren the Myrddraal
took the Trollocs back to the closest Waygate, in the Mountains of
Mist, and sent Fain across alone. He thought he was free then, but
before he reached Baerlon another Fade found him, and that one was
not so kind. It made him sleep doubled up on himself in a Trolloc
kettle at night, to remind him of the price of failure. That one
used him as far as Shadar Logoth. By then Fain was willing to give
the Myrddraal his mother if it would free him, but the Dark One
never willingly loosens a hold he has gained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I did there, sending an illusion of our tracks
and smell off toward the mountains, fooled the Myrddraal, but not
Fain. The Halfmen did not believe him; afterward, they dragged him
behind them on a leash. Only when we seemed to keep always just
ahead, no matter how hard they pressed, did some begin to credit
him. Those were the four who returned to Shadar Logoth. Fain claims
it was Ba&rsquo;alzamon himself who drove the Myrddraal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Agelmar shook his head contemptuously. &ldquo;The Dark One?
Pah! The man&rsquo;s lying or mad. If Heartsbane were loose, we&rsquo;d all of
us be dead by now, or worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fain spoke the truth as he saw it,&rdquo; Moiraine said.
&ldquo;He could not lie to me, though he hid much. His words. &lsquo;Ba&rsquo;alzamon
appeared like a flickering candle flame, vanishing and reappearing,
never in the same place twice. His eyes seared the Myrddraal, and
the fires of his mouth scourged us.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Something</em>,&rdquo; Lan said, &ldquo;drove four Fades to
where they feared to go&mdash;a place they fear almost as much as
they fear the wrath of the Dark One.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Agelmar grunted as if he had been kicked; he looked
sick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was evil against evil in the ruins of Shadar
Logoth,&rdquo; Moiraine continued, &ldquo;foul fighting vile. When Fain spoke
of it, his teeth chattered and he whimpered. Many Trollocs were
slain, consumed by Mashadar and other things, including the Trolloc
that held Fain&rsquo;s leash. He fled the city as if it were the Pit of
Doom, at Shayol Ghul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fain believed he was free at last. He intended to
run until Ba&rsquo;alzamon could never find him again, to the ends of the
earth if necessary. Imagine his horror when he discovered that the
compulsion to hunt did not lessen. Instead, it grew stronger and
sharper with every day that passed. He could not eat, except what
he could scavenge while he hunted you&mdash;beetles and lizards
snatched while he ran, half-rotten refuse dug from midden heaps in
the dark of night&mdash;nor could he stop until exhaustion collapsed
him like an empty sack. And as soon as he had strength to stand
again, he was driven on. By the time he reached Caemlyn he could
<em>feel</em> his quarry even when it was a mile away. Here, in the
cells below, he would sometimes look up without realizing what he
was doing. He was looking in the direction of this room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand had a sudden itch between his shoulder blades;
it was as if he could feel Fain&rsquo;s eyes on him then, through the
intervening stone. The Aes Sedai noticed his uneasy shrug, but she
went on implacably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Fain was half mad by the time he reached Caemlyn,
he sank even further when he realized that only two of those he
sought were there. He was compelled to find all of you, but he
could do no other than follow the two who were there, either. He
spoke of screaming when the Waygate opened in Caemlyn. The
knowledge of how to do it was in his mind; he does not know how it
came there; his hands moved of their own accord, burning with the
fires of Ba&rsquo;alzamon when he tried to stop them. The owner of the
shop, who came to investigate the noise, Fain murdered. Not because
he had to, but out of envy that the man could walk freely out of
the cellar while his feet carried him inexorably into the
Ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Fain was the one you sensed following us,&rdquo;
Egwene said. Lan nodded. &ldquo;How did he escape the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the Black
Wind?&rdquo; Her voice shook; she stopped to swallow. &ldquo;It was right
behind us at the Waygate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He escaped, and he did not,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;The
Black Wind caught him&mdash;and he claimed to understand the
voices. Some greeted him as like to them; others feared him. No
sooner did the Wind envelop Fain than it fled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light preserve us.&rdquo; Loial&rsquo;s whisper rumbled like
a giant bumblebee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray that it does,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;There is much
yet hidden about Padan Fain, much I must learn. The evil goes
deeper in him, and stronger, than in any man I have yet seen. It
may be that the Dark One, in doing what he did to Fain, impressed
some part of himself on the man, perhaps even, unknowing, some part
of his intent. When I mentioned the Eye of the World, Fain clamped
his jaws shut, but I felt something knowing behind the silence. If
only I had the time now. But we cannot wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If this man knows something,&rdquo; Agelmar said, &ldquo;I can
get it out of him.&rdquo; His face held no mercy for Darkfriends; his
voice promised no pity for Fain. &ldquo;If you can learn even a part of
what you will face in the Blight, it&rsquo;s worth an extra day. Battles
have been lost for not knowing what the enemy intends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine sighed and shook her head ruefully. &ldquo;My
lord, if we did not need at least one good night&rsquo;s sleep before
facing the Blight, I would ride within the hour, though it meant
the risk of meeting a Trolloc raid in the dark. Consider what I did
learn from Fain. Three years ago the Dark One had to have Fain
brought to Shayol Ghul to touch him, despite the fact that Fain is
a Darkfriend dedicated to his marrow. One year ago, the Dark One
could command Fain, the Darkfriend, through his dreams. This year,
Ba&rsquo;alzamon walks in the dreams of those who live in the Light, and
actually appears, if with difficulty, at Shadar Logoth. Not in his
own body, of course, but even a projection of the Dark One&rsquo;s mind,
even a projection that flickers and cannot hold, is more deathly
dangerous to the world than all the Trolloc hordes combined. The
seals on Shayol Ghul are weakening desperately, Lord Agelmar. There
is no time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Agelmar bowed his head in acquiescence, but when he
raised it again there was still a stubborn set to his mouth. &ldquo;Aes
Sedai, I can accept that when I lead the lances to Tarwin&rsquo;s Gap we
will be no more than a diversion, or a skirmish on the outskirts of
the real battle. Duty takes men where it will as surely as does the
Pattern, and neither promises that what we do will have greatness.
But our skirmish will be useless, even should we win, if you lose
the battle. If you say your party must be small, I say well and
good, but I beg you to make every effort to see that you can win.
Leave these young men here, Aes Sedai. I swear to you that I can
find three experienced men with no thought of glory in their heads
to replace them, good swordsmen who are almost as handy in the
Blight as Lan. Let me ride to the Gap knowing that I have done what
I can to help you be victorious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must take them and no others, Lord Agelmar,&rdquo;
Moiraine said gently. &ldquo;They are the ones who will fight the battle
at the Eye of the World.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Agelmar&rsquo;s jaw dropped, and he stared at Rand and Mat
and Perrin. Suddenly the Lord of Fal Dara took a step back, his
hand groping unconsciously for the sword he never wore inside the
fortress. &ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;You are not Red Ajah, Moiraine Sedai,
but surely not even you would&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Sudden sweat glistened on his
shaven head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>,&rdquo; Moiraine said
soothingly. &ldquo;The Pattern weaves itself around them. Already the
Dark One has tried to kill each of them more than once. Three
<em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> in one place are enough to change the life around
them as surely as a whirlpool changes the path of a straw. When the
place is the Eye of the World, the Pattern might weave even the
Father of Lies into itself, and make him harmless again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Agelmar stopped trying to find his sword, but he
still looked at Rand and the others doubtfully. &ldquo;Moiraine Sedai, if
you say they are, then they are, but I cannot see it. Farmboys. Are
you certain, Aes Sedai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old blood,&rdquo; Moiraine said, &ldquo;split out like a
river breaking into a thousand times a thousand streams, but
sometimes streams join together to make a river again. The old
blood of Manetheren is strong and pure in almost all these young
men. Can you doubt the strength of Manetheren&rsquo;s blood, Lord
Agelmar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand glanced sideways at the Aes Sedai. <em>Almost
all</em>. He risked a look at Nynaeve; she had turned back to watch
as well as listen, though she still avoided looking at Lan. He
caught the Wisdom&rsquo;s eye. She shook her head; she had not told the
Aes Sedai that he was not Two Rivers born. <em>What does Moiraine
know?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Manetheren,&rdquo; Agelmar said slowly, nodding. &ldquo;I would
not doubt that blood.&rdquo; Then, more quickly, &ldquo;The Wheel brings
strange times. Farmboys carry the honor of Manetheren into the
Blight, yet if any blood can strike a fell blow at the Dark One, it
would be the blood of Manetheren. It shall be done as you wish, Aes
Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let us go to our rooms,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;We
must leave with the sun, for time grows short. The young men must
sleep close to me. Time is too short before the battle to allow the
Dark One another strike at them. Too short.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand felt her eyes on him, studying him and his
friends, weighing their strength, and he shivered. Too short.</p>
