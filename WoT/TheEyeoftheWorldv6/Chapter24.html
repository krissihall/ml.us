dripped in the distance, hollow splashes echoing and
reechoing, losing their source forever. There were stone bridges
and tailless ramps everywhere, all sprouting off from broad,
flat-topped stone spires, all polished and smooth and streaked with
red and gold. Level on level, the maze stretched up and down
through the murk, without any apparent beginning or end. Every
bridge led to a spire, every ramp to another spire, other bridges.
Whatever direction Rand looked, as far as his eye could make out in
the dimness it was the same, above as well as below. There was not
enough light to see clearly, and he was almost glad of it. Some of
those ramps led to platforms that had to be directly above the ones
below. He could not see the base of any of them. He pressed,

was, as if it seeped out of the air. Enough by which to see, after
a fashion; enough by which to be seen. But stillness gave a little
protection.</p>

<p>The movement came again, and now it was clear. A man stridin
