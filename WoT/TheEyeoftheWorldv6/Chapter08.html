he was still coming through the door Rand&rsquo;s eyes went to
his father&mdash;his father no matter what <em>anyone</em> said. Tam had
not moved an inch; his eyes were still shut, and his breath came in
labored gasps, low and rasping. The white-haired gleeman cut off a
conversation with the Mayor&mdash;who was bent over the bed again,
tending Tam&mdash;and gave Moiraine an uneasy look. The Aes Sedai
ignored him. Indeed, she ignored everyone except for Tam, but at
him she stared with an intent frown.</p>

<p>Thom stuck his unlit pipe between his teeth, then snatched it
out again and glowered at it. &ldquo;Man cannot even smoke in peace,&rdquo; he
muttered. &ldquo;I had better make sure some farmer doesn&rsquo;t steal my
cloak to keep his cow warm. At least I can have my pipe out there.&rdquo;
He hurried out of the room.</p>

<p>Lan stared after him, his angular face as expressionless as a
rock. &ldquo;I do not like that man. There is something about him I don&rsquo;t
trust. I did not see a hair of him last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was there,&rdquo; Bran said, watching Moiraine uncertainly. &ldquo;He
must have been. His cloak did not get singed in front of the
fireplace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand did not care if the gleeman had spent the night hiding in
the stable. &ldquo;My father?&rdquo; he said to Moiraine pleadingly.</p>

<p>Bran opened his mouth, but before he could speak Moiraine said,
&ldquo;Leave me with him, Master al&rsquo;Vere. There is nothing you can do
here now except get in my way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a minute Bran hesitated, torn between dislike of being
ordered about in his own inn and reluctance to disobey an Aes
Sedai. Finally, he straightened to clap Rand on the shoulder.
&ldquo;Come along, boy. Let us leave Moiraine Sedai to her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;There&rsquo;s plenty you can give me a hand with
downstairs. Before you know it Tam will be shouting for his pipe
and a mug of ale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I stay?&rdquo; Rand spoke to Moiraine, though she did not really
seem to be aware of anyone besides Tam. Bran&rsquo;s hand tightened, but
Rand ignored him. &ldquo;Please? I&rsquo;ll keep out of your way. You won&rsquo;t
even know I am here. He&rsquo;s my <em>father</em>,&rdquo; he added with a fierceness
that startled him and widened the Mayor&rsquo;s eyes in surprise. Rand
hoped the others put it down to tiredness, or the strain of dealing
with an Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; Moiraine said impatiently. She had tossed her cloak
and staff carelessly across the only chair in the room, and now she
pushed up the sleeves of her gown, baring her arms to her elbows.
Her attention never really left Tam, even while she spoke. &ldquo;Sit
over there. And you, too, Lan.&rdquo; She gestured vaguely in the
direction of a long bench against the wall. Her eyes traveled
slowly from Tam&rsquo;s feet to his head, but Rand had the prickly
feeling that she was looking <em>beyond</em> him in some fashion. &ldquo;You may
talk if you wish,&rdquo; she went on absently, &ldquo;but do it quietly. Now,
you go, Master al&rsquo;Vere. This is a sickroom, not a gathering hall.
See that I am not disturbed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Mayor grumbled under his breath, though not loudly enough to
catch her attention, of course, squeezed Rand&rsquo;s shoulder again,
then obediently, if reluctantly, closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>Muttering to herself, the Aes Sedai knelt beside the bed and
rested her hands lightly on Tam&rsquo;s chest. She closed her eyes, and
for a long time she neither moved nor made a sound.</p>

<p>In the stories Aes Sedai wonders were always accompanied by
flashes and thunderclaps, or other signs to indicate mighty works
and great powers. <em>The</em> Power. The One Power, drawn from the True
Source that drove the Wheel of Time. That was not something Rand
wanted to think about, the Power involved with Tam, himself in the
same room where the Power might be used. In the same village was
bad enough. For all he could tell, though, Moiraine might just as
well have gone to sleep. But he thought Tam&rsquo;s breathing sounded
easier. She must be doing something. So intent was he that he
jumped when Lan spoke softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a fine weapon you wear. Is there by chance a heron on
the blade, as well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Rand stared at the Warder, not grasping what it was
he was talking about. He had completely forgotten Tam&rsquo;s sword in
the lather of dealing with an Aes Sedai. It did not seem so heavy
anymore. &ldquo;Yes, there is. What is she doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d not have thought to find a heron-mark sword in a place like
this,&rdquo; Lan said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It belongs to my father.&rdquo; He glanced at Lan&rsquo;s sword, the hilt
just visible at the edge of his cloak; the two swords did look a
good deal alike, except that no herons showed on the Warder&rsquo;s. He
swung his eyes back to the bed. Tam&rsquo;s breathing did sound easier;
the rasp was gone. He was sure of it. &ldquo;He bought it a long time
ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strange thing for a sheepherder to buy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand spared a sidelong look for Lan. For a stranger to wonder
about the sword was prying. For a Warder to do it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Still, he
felt he had to say something. &ldquo;He never had any use for it, that I
know of. He said it <em>had</em> no use. Until last night, anyway. I didn&rsquo;t
even know he had it till then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He called it useless, did he? He must not always have thought
so.&rdquo; Lan touched the scabbard at Rand&rsquo;s waist briefly with one
finger. &ldquo;There are places where the heron is a symbol of the master
swordsman. That blade must have traveled a strange road to end up
with a sheepherder in the Two Rivers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand ignored the unspoken question. Moiraine still had not
moved. <em>Was</em> the Aes Sedai doing anything? He shivered and rubbed his
arms, not sure he really wanted to know what she was doing. An Aes
Sedai.</p>

<p>A question of his own popped into his head then, one he did not
want to ask, one he needed an answer to. &ldquo;The Mayor&mdash;&rdquo; He
cleared his throat, and took a deep breath. &ldquo;The Mayor said the
only reason there&rsquo;s anything left of the village is because of you
and her.&rdquo; He made himself look at the Warder. &ldquo;If you had been told
about a man in the woods&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a man who made people afraid just by
looking at them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;would that have warned you? A man whose horse
doesn&rsquo;t make any noise? And the wind doesn&rsquo;t touch his cloak? Would you have known what
was going to happen? Could you and Moiraine Sedai have stopped it
if you&rsquo;d known about him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not without half a dozen of my sisters,&rdquo; Moiraine said, and
Rand started. She still knelt by the bed, but she had taken her
hands from Tam and half turned to face the two of them on the
bench. Her voice never raised, but her eyes pinned Rand to the
wall. &ldquo;Had I known when I left Tar Valon that I would find Trollocs
and Myrddraal here, I would have brought half a dozen of them, a
dozen, if I had to drag them by the scruffs of their necks. By
myself, a month&rsquo;s warning would have made little difference.
Perhaps none. There is only so much one person can do, even calling
on the One Power, and there were probably well over a hundred
Trollocs scattered around this district last night. An entire
fist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would still have been good to know,&rdquo; Lan said sharply, the
sharpness directed at Rand. &ldquo;When did you see him, exactly, and
where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s of no consequence now,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;I will not have
the boy thinking he is to blame for something when he is not. I am
as much to blame. That accursed raven yesterday, the way it
behaved, should have warned me. And you, too, my old friend.&rdquo; Her
tongue clicked angrily. &ldquo;I was overconfident to the point of
arrogance, sure that the Dark One&rsquo;s touch could not have spread so
far. Nor so heavily, not yet. So sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand blinked. &ldquo;The raven? I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carrion eaters.&rdquo; Lan&rsquo;s mouth twisted in distaste. &ldquo;The Dark
One&rsquo;s minions often find spies among creatures that feed on death.
Ravens and crows, mainly. Rats, in the cities, sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A quick shiver ran through Rand. Ravens and crows as spies of
the Dark One? There were ravens and crows everywhere now. The Dark
One&rsquo;s touch, Moiraine had said. The Dark One was always there&mdash;he knew that&mdash;but if you tried to walk in the Light,
tried to live a good life, and did not name him, he could not harm
you. That was what everybody believed, what everybody learned with
his mother&rsquo;s milk. But Moiraine seemed to be saying&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His glance fell on Tam, and everything else was pushed right out
of his head. His father&rsquo;s face was noticeably less flushed than it
had been, and his breathing sounded almost normal. Rand would have
leaped up if Lan had not caught his arm. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine shook her head and sighed. &ldquo;Not yet. I hope it is only
not yet. Trolloc weapons are made at forges in the valley called
Thakan&rsquo;dar, on the very slopes of Shayol Ghul itself. Some of them
take a taint from that place, a stain of evil in the metal. Those
tainted blades make wounds that will not heal unaided, or cause
deadly fevers, strange sicknesses that medicines cannot touch. I
have soothed your father&rsquo;s pain, but the mark, the taint, is still
in him. Left alone, it will grow again, and consume him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t leave it alone.&rdquo; Rand&rsquo;s words were half plea,
half command. He was shocked to realize he had spoken to an Aes
Sedai like that, but she seemed not to notice his tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; she agreed simply. &ldquo;I am very tired, Rand, and I
have had no chance to rest since last night. Ordinarily it would
not matter, but for this kind of hurt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;This&rdquo;&mdash;she took a
small bundle of white silk from her pouch&mdash;&ldquo;is an <em>angreal</em>.&rdquo;
She saw his expression. &ldquo;You know of <em>angreal</em>, then. Good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unconsciously he leaned back, further away from her and what she
held. A few stories mentioned <em>angreal</em>, those relics of the Age of
Legends that Aes Sedai used to perform their greatest wonders. He
was startled to see her unwrap a smooth ivory figurine,
age-darkened to deep brown. No longer than her hand, it was a woman
in flowing robes, with long hair falling about her shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have lost the making of these,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;So much is lost,
perhaps never to be found again. So few remain, the Amyrlin Seat
almost did not allow me to take this one. It is well for Emond&rsquo;s
Field, and for your father, that she did give her permission. But
you must not hope too much. Now, even with it, I can do little more
than I could have without it yesterday, and the taint is strong. It
has had time to fester.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can help him,&rdquo; Rand said fervently. &ldquo;I know you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine smiled, a bare curving of her lips. &ldquo;We shall see.&rdquo;
Then she turned back to Tam. One hand she laid on his forehead; the
other cupped the ivory figure. Eyes closed, her face took on a look
of concentration. She scarcely seemed to breathe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That rider you spoke of,&rdquo; Lan said quietly, &ldquo;the one who made
you afraid&mdash;that was surely a Myrddraal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Myrddraal!&rdquo; Rand exclaimed. &ldquo;But Fades are twenty feet tall
and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; The words faded away under the Warder&rsquo;s mirthless
grin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes, sheepherder, stories make things larger than truth.
Believe me, the truth is big enough with a Halfman. Halfman, Lurk,
Fade, Shadowman; the name depends on the land you&rsquo;re in, but they
all mean Myrddraal. Fades are Trolloc spawn, throwbacks almost to
the human stock the Dreadlords used to make the Trollocs. Almost.
But if the human strain is made stronger, so is the taint that
twists the Trollocs. Halfmen have powers of a kind, the sort that
stem from the Dark One. Only the weakest Aes Sedai would fail to be
a match for a Fade, one against one, but many a good man and true
has fallen to them. Since the wars that ended the Age of Legends,
since the Forsaken were bound, they have been the brain that tells
the Trolloc fists where to strike. In the days of the Trolloc Wars,
Halfmen led the Trollocs in battle, under the Dreadlords.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He scared me,&rdquo; Rand said faintly. &ldquo;He just looked at me, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He shivered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No need for shame, sheepherder. They scare me, too. I&rsquo;ve seen
men who have been soldiers all their lives freeze like a bird
facing a snake when they confronted a Halfman. In the north, in the
Borderlands along the Great Blight, there is a saying. The look of
the Eyeless is fear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Eyeless?&rdquo; Rand said, and Lan nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Myrddraal see like eagles, in darkness or in light, but they
have no eyes. I can think of few things more dangerous than facing
a Myrddraal. Moiraine Sedai and I both tried to kill the one that
was here last night, and we failed every time. Halfmen have the
Dark One&rsquo;s own luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand swallowed. &ldquo;A Trolloc said the Myrddraal wanted to talk to
me: I didn&rsquo;t know what it meant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan&rsquo;s head jerked up; his eyes were blue stones. &ldquo;You <em>talked</em> to
a Trolloc?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; Rand stammered. The Warder&rsquo;s gaze held him like a
trap. &ldquo;It talked to me. It said it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt me, that the
Myrddraal wanted to talk to me. Then it tried to kill me.&rdquo; He
licked his lips and rubbed his hand along the knobby leather of the
sword hilt. In short, choppy sentences he explained about returning
to the farmhouse. &ldquo;I killed it, instead,&rdquo; he finished. &ldquo;By
accident, really. It jumped at me, and I had the sword in my
hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan&rsquo;s face softened slightly, if rock could be said to soften.
&ldquo;Even so, that is something to speak of, sheepherder. Until last
night there were few men south of the Borderlands who could say
they had seen a Trolloc, much less killed one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And fewer still who have slain a Trolloc alone and unaided,&rdquo;
Moiraine said wearily. &ldquo;It is done, Rand. Lan, help me up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Warder sprang to her side, but he was no quicker than Rand
darting to the bed. Tam&rsquo;s skin was cool to the touch, though his
face had a pale, washed-out look, as if he had spent far too long
out of the sun. His eyes were still closed, but he drew the deep
breaths of normal sleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will be all right now?&rdquo; Rand asked anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With rest, yes,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;A few weeks in bed, and he
will be as good as ever.&rdquo; She walked unsteadily, despite holding
Lan&rsquo;s arm. He swept her cloak and staff from the chair cushion for
her to sit, and she eased herself down with a sigh. With a slow
care she rewrapped the <em>angreal</em>  and returned it to her pouch.</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s shoulders shook; he bit his lip to keep from laughing. At
the same time he had to scrub a hand across his eyes to clear away
tears. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the Age of Legends,&rdquo; Moiraine went on, &ldquo;some Aes Sedai could
fan life and health to flame if only the smallest spark remained.
Those days are gone, though&mdash;perhaps forever. So much was lost; not
just the making of <em>angreal</em>. So much that could be done which we
dare not even dream of, if we remember it at all. There are far
fewer of us now. Some talents are all but gone, and many that
remain seem weaker. Now there must be both will and strength for
the body to draw on, or even the strongest of us can do nothing in
the way of Healing. It is fortunate that your father is a strong
man, both in body and spirit. As it is, he used up much of his
strength in the fight for life, but all that is left now is for him
to recuperate. That will take time, but the taint is gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can never repay you,&rdquo; he told her without taking his eyes
from Tam, &ldquo;but anything I can do for you, I will. Anything at all.&rdquo;
He remembered the talk of prices, then, and his promise. Kneeling
beside Tam he meant it even more than before, but it still was not
easy to look at her. &ldquo;Anything. As long as it does not hurt the
village, or my friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine raised a hand dismissively. &ldquo;If you think it is
necessary. I would like to talk with you, anyway. You will no doubt
leave at the same time we do, and we can speak at length then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave!&rdquo; he exclaimed, scrambling to his feet. &ldquo;Is it really
that bad? Everyone looked to me as if they were ready to start
rebuilding. We are pretty settled folk in the Two Rivers. Nobody
ever leaves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where would we go? Padan Fain said the weather is just as
bad everywhere else. He&rsquo;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;he was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the peddler. The
Trollocs&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Rand swallowed; wishing Thom Merrilin had not told
him what Trollocs ate. &ldquo;The best I can see to do is stay right here
where we belong, in the Two Rivers, and put things back together.
We have crops in the ground, and it has to warm enough for the
shearing, soon. I don&rsquo;t know who started this talk about
leaving&mdash;one of the Coplins, I&rsquo;ll bet&mdash;but whoever it was&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sheepherder,&rdquo; Lan broke in, &ldquo;you talk when you should be
listening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He blinked at both of them. He had been half babbling, he
realized, and he had rambled on while she tried to talk. While an
Aes Sedai tried to talk. He wondered what to say, how to apologize,
but Moiraine smiled while he was still thinking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand how you feel, Rand,&rdquo; she said, and he had the
uncomfortable feeling that she really did. &ldquo;Think no more of it.&rdquo;
Her mouth tightened, and she shook her head. &ldquo;I have handled this
badly, I see. I should have rested, first, I suppose. It is you who
will be leaving, Rand. You who must leave, for the sake of your
village.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; He cleared his throat and tried again. &ldquo;Me?&rdquo; It sounded a
little better this time. &ldquo;Why do I have to go? I don&rsquo;t understand
any of this. I don&rsquo;t want to go anywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine looked at Lan, and the Warder unfolded his arms.</p>

<p>He looked at Rand from under his leather headband, and Rand had
the feeling of being weighed on invisible scales again. &ldquo;Did you know,&rdquo;
Lan said suddenly, &ldquo;that some homes were not
attacked?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Half the village is in ashes,&rdquo; he protested, but the Warder
waved it away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some houses were only torched to create confusion. The Trollocs
ignored them afterwards, and the people who fled from them as well,
unless they actually got in the way of the true attack. Most of the
people who&rsquo;ve come in from the outlying farms never saw a hair of a
Trolloc, and that only at a distance. Most never knew there was any
trouble until they saw the village.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did hear about Darl Coplin,&rdquo; Rand said slowly. &ldquo;I suppose it
just didn&rsquo;t sink in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two farms were attacked,&rdquo; Lan went on. &ldquo;Yours and one other.
Because of Bel Tine everyone who lived at the second farm was
already in the village. Many people were saved because the
Myrddraal was ignorant of Two Rivers customs. Festival and
Winternight made its task all but impossible, but it did not know
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand looked at Moiraine, leaning back in the chair, but she said
nothing, only watched him, a finger laid across her lips. &ldquo;Our
farm, and who else&rsquo;s?&rdquo; he asked finally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Aybara farm,&rdquo; Lan replied. &ldquo;Here in Emond&rsquo;s Field, they
struck first at the forge, and the blacksmith&rsquo;s house, and Master
Cauthon&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s mouth was suddenly dry. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s crazy,&rdquo; he managed to get
out, then jumped as Moiraine straightened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not crazy, Rand,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Purposeful. The Trollocs did not
come to Emond&rsquo;s Field by happenstance, and they did not do what
they did for the pleasure of killing and burning, however much that
delighted them. They knew what, or rather who, they were after. The
Trollocs came to kill or capture young men of a certain age who
live near Emond&rsquo;s Field.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My age?&rdquo; Rand&rsquo;s voice shook, and he did not care. &ldquo;Light! Mat.
What about Perrin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alive and well,&rdquo; Moiraine assured him, &ldquo;if a trifle sooty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ban Crawe and Lem Thane?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were never in any danger,&rdquo; Lan said. &ldquo;At least, no more than
anyone else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they saw the rider, the Fade, too, and they&rsquo;re the same age
as I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Crawe&rsquo;s house was not even damaged,&rdquo; Moiraine said, &ldquo;and
the miller and his family slept through half the attack before the
noise woke them. Ban is ten months older than you, and Lem eight
months younger.&rdquo; She smiled dryly at his surprise. &ldquo;I told you I
asked questions. And I also said young men of a <em>certain</em> age. You
and your two friends are within weeks of one another. It was you
three the Myrddraal sought, and none others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shifted uneasily, wishing she would not look at him like
that, as if her eyes could pierce his brain and read what lay in
every corner of it. &ldquo;What would they want with us? We&rsquo;re just
farmers, shepherds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a question that has no answer in the Two Rivers,&rdquo;
Moiraine said quietly, &ldquo;but the answer is important. Trollocs where
they have not been seen in almost two thousand years tells us that
much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lots of stories tell about Trolloc raids,&rdquo; Rand said
stubbornly. &ldquo;We just never had one here before. Warders fight
Trollocs all the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan snorted. &ldquo;Boy, I expect to fight Trollocs along the Great
Blight, but not here, nearly six hundred leagues to the south. That
was as hot a raid last night as I&rsquo;d expect to see in Shienar, or
any of the Borderlands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In one of you,&rdquo; Moiraine said, &ldquo;or all three, there is
something the Dark One fears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo; Rand stumbled to the window and
stared out at the village, at the people working among the ruins.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what&rsquo;s happened, that is just impossible.&rdquo; Something
on the Green caught his eye. He stared, then realized it was the
blackened stump of the Spring Pole. A fine Bel Tine, with a
peddler, and a gleeman, and strangers. He shivered, and shook his
head violently. &ldquo;No. No, I&rsquo;m a shepherd. The Dark One can&rsquo;t be
interested in me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It took a great deal of effort,&rdquo; Lan said grimly, &ldquo;to bring so
many Trollocs so far without raising a hue and cry from the
Borderlands to Caemlyn and beyond. I wish I knew how they did it.
Do you really believe they went to all that bother just to burn a
few houses?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will be back,&rdquo; Moiraine added.</p>

<p>Rand had his mouth open to argue with Lan, but that brought him
up short. He spun to face her. &ldquo;Back? Can&rsquo;t you stop them? You did
last night, and you were surprised, then. Now you know they are
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Moiraine replied. &ldquo;I could send to Tar Valon for some
of my sisters; they might have time to make the journey before we
need them. The Myrddraal knows <em>I</em> am here, too, and it probably will
not attack&mdash;not openly, at least&mdash;lacking
reinforcements, more Myrddraal and more Trollocs. With enough Aes
Sedai and enough Warders, the Trollocs can be beaten off, though I
cannot say how many battles it will take.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A vision danced in his head, of Emond&rsquo;s Field all in ashes. All
the farms burned. And Watch Hill, and Deven Ride, and Taren Ferry.
All ashes and blood. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, and felt a wrenching inside as
if he had lost his grip on something. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I have to leave,
isn&rsquo;t it? The Trollocs won&rsquo;t come back if I am not here.&rdquo; A last
trace of obstinacy made him add, &ldquo;If they really are after me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine&rsquo;s eyebrows raised as if she were surprised that he was
not convinced, but Lan said, &ldquo;Are you willing to bet your village
on it, sheepherder? Your whole Two Rivers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s stubbornness faded. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said again, and felt that
emptiness inside again, too. &ldquo;Perrin and Mat have to go, too, don&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo; Leaving the Two Rivers. Leaving his home and his father. At
least Tam would get better. At least he would be able to hear him
say all that on the Quarry Road had been nonsense. &ldquo;We could go to
Baerlon, I suppose, or even Caemlyn. I&rsquo;ve heard there are more
people in Caemlyn than in the whole Two Rivers. We&rsquo;d be safe
there.&rdquo; He tried out a laugh that sounded hollow. &ldquo;I used to
daydream about seeing Caemlyn. I never thought it would come about
like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a long silence, then Lan said, &ldquo;I would not count on
Caemlyn for safety. If the Myrddraal want you badly enough, they
will find a way. Walls are a poor bar to a Halfman. And you would
be a fool not to believe they want you very badly indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand thought his spirits had sunk as low as they possibly could,
but at that they slid deeper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a place of safety,&rdquo; Moiraine said softly, and Rand&rsquo;s
ears pricked up to listen. &ldquo;In Tar Valon you would be among Aes
Sedai and Warders. Even during the Trolloc Wars the forces of the
Dark One feared to attack the Shining Walls. The one attempt was
their greatest defeat until the very end. And Tar Valon holds all
the knowledge we Aes Sedai have gathered since the Time of Madness.
Some fragments even date from the Age of Legends. In Tar Valon, if
anywhere, you will be able to learn why the Myrddraal want you. Why
the Father of Lies wants you. That I can promise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A journey all the way to Tar Valon was almost beyond thinking. A
journey to a place where he would be surrounded by Aes Sedai. Of
course, Moiraine had healed Tam&mdash;or it looked as if she had;
at least&mdash;but there were all those stories. It was
uncomfortable enough to be in a room with one Aes Sedai, but to be
in a city full of them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;And she still had not demanded her
price. There was always a price, so the stories said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long will my father sleep?&rdquo; he asked at last. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I
have to tell him. He shouldn&rsquo;t just wake and find me gone.&rdquo; He
thought he heard Lan give a sigh of relief. He looked at the Warder
curiously, but Lan&rsquo;s face was as expressionless as ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is unlikely he will wake before we depart,&rdquo; Moiraine said.
&ldquo;I mean to go soon after full dark. Even a single day of delay
could be fatal. It will be best if you leave him a note.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the night?&rdquo; Rand said doubtfully, and Lan nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Halfman will discover we are gone soon enough. There is no
need to make things any easier for it than we must.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand fussed with his father&rsquo;s blankets. It was a very long way
to Tar Valon. &ldquo;In that case&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;In that case, I had better go
find Mat and Perrin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will attend to that.&rdquo; Moiraine got to her feet briskly and
donned her cloak with suddenly restored vigor. She put a hand on
his shoulder, and he tried very hard not to flinch. She did not
press hard, but it was an iron grip that held him as surely as a
forked stick held a snake. &ldquo;It will be best if we keep all of this
just among us. Do you understand? The same ones who put the
Dragon&rsquo;s Fang on the inn door might make trouble if they knew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo; He drew a relieved breath when she took her hand
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will have Mistress al&rsquo;Vere bring you something to eat,&rdquo; she
went on just as if she had not noticed his reaction. &ldquo;Then you need
to sleep. It will be a hard journey tonight even if you are
rested.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door closed behind them, and Rand stood looking down at Tam&mdash;looking at Tam; but seeing nothing. Not until that very
minute had he realized that Emond&rsquo;s Field was a part of him as much
as he was a part of it. He realized it now because he knew that was
what he had felt tearing loose. He was apart from the village, now.
The Shepherd of the Night wanted him. It was impossible&mdash;he
was only a farmer&mdash;but the Trollocs had come, and Lan was
right about one thing. He could not risk the village on the chance
Moiraine was wrong. He could not even tell anyone; the Coplins
really would make trouble about something like that. He had to
trust an Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wake him, now,&rdquo; Mistress al&rsquo;Vere said, as the Mayor shut
the door behind his wife and himself. The cloth-covered tray she
carried gave off delicious, warm smells. She set it on the chest
against the wall, then firmly moved Rand away from the bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mistress Moiraine told me what he needs,&rdquo; she said softly, &ldquo;and
it does not include you falling on top of him from exhaustion. I&rsquo;ve
brought you a bite to eat. Don&rsquo;t let it get cold, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t call her that,&rdquo; Bran said peevishly.
&ldquo;Moiraine Sedai is proper. She might get mad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mistress al&rsquo;Vere gave him a pat on the cheek. &ldquo;You just leave me
to worry about that. She and I had a long talk. And keep your voice
down. If you wake Tam, you&rsquo;ll have to answer to me <em>and</em> Moiraine
Sedai.&rdquo; She put an emphasis on Moiraine&rsquo;s title that made Bran&rsquo;s
insistence seem foolish. &ldquo;The two of you keep out of my way.&rdquo; With
a fond smile for her husband, she turned to the bed and Tam.</p>

<p>Master al&rsquo;Vere gave Rand a frustrated look. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s an Aes Sedai.
Half the women in the village act as if she sits in the Women&rsquo;s
Circle, and the rest as if she were a Trolloc. Not a one of them
seems to realize you have to be careful around Aes Sedai. The men
may keep looking at her sideways, but at least they aren&rsquo;t doing
anything that might provoke her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Careful, Rand thought. It was not too late to start being
careful. &ldquo;Master al&rsquo;Vere,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;do you know how many
farms were attacked?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only two that I&rsquo;ve heard of so far, including your place.&rdquo; The
Mayor paused, frowning, then shrugged. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem enough,
with what happened here. I should be glad of it, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Well,
we&rsquo;ll probably hear of more before the day is out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand sighed. No need to ask which farms. &ldquo;Here in the village,
did they&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I mean, was there anything to show what they were
after?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After, boy? I don&rsquo;t know that they were after anything, except
maybe killing us all. It was just the way I said. The dogs barking,
and Moiraine Sedai and Lan running through the streets, then
somebody shouted that Master Luhhan&rsquo;s house and the forge were on
fire. Abell Cauthon&rsquo;s house flared up&mdash;odd that; it&rsquo;s nearly
in the middle of the village. Anyway, the next thing the Trollocs
were all among us. No, I don&rsquo;t think they were <em>after</em> anything.&rdquo; He
gave an abrupt bark of a laugh, and cut it short with a wary look
at his wife. She did not look around from Tam. &ldquo;To tell the truth,&rdquo;
he went on more quietly, &ldquo;they seemed almost as confused as we
were. I doubt they expected to find an Aes Sedai here, or a
Warder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; Rand said, grimacing.</p>

<p>If Moiraine had told the truth about that, she probably had told
the truth about the rest, too. For a moment he thought about asking
the Mayor&rsquo;s advice, but Master al&rsquo;Vere obviously knew little more
about Aes Sedai than anyone else in the village. Besides, he was
reluctant to tell even the Mayor what was going on&mdash;what Moiraine
said was going on. He was not sure if he was more afraid of being
laughed at or being believed. He rubbed a thumb against the hilt of
Tam&rsquo;s sword. His father had been out into the world; he must know
more about Aes Sedai than the Mayor did. But if Tam really had been
out of the Two Rivers, then maybe what he had said in the Westwood&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He scrubbed both hands through his hair, scattering that line
of thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need sleep, lad,&rdquo; the Mayor said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you do,&rdquo; Mistress al&rsquo;Vere added. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re almost falling
down where you stand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand blinked at her in surprise. He had not even realized she
had left his father. He did need sleep; just the thought set off a
yawn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can take the bed in the next room,&rdquo; the Mayor said.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s already a fire laid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand looked at his father; Tam was still deep in sleep, and that
made him yawn again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather stay in here, if you don&rsquo;t mind.
For when he wakes up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sickroom matters were in Mistress al&rsquo;Vere&rsquo;s province, and the
Mayor left it to her. She hesitated only a moment before nodding.
&ldquo;But you let him wake on his own. If you bother his sleep&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He
tried to say he would do as she ordered, but the words got tangled
in yet another yawn. She shook her head with a smile. &ldquo;You will be
asleep yourself in no time at all. If you must stay, curl up next
to the fire. And drink a little of that beef broth before you doze
off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; Rand said. He would have agreed to anything that kept
him in that room. &ldquo;And I won&rsquo;t wake him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See that you do not,&rdquo; Mistress al&rsquo;Vere told him firmly, but not
in an unkindly way. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring you up a pillow and some
blankets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the door finally closed behind them, Rand dragged the lone
chair in the room over beside the bed and sat down where he could
watch Tam. It was all very well for Mistress al&rsquo;Vere to talk about
sleep&mdash;his jaws cracked as he stifled a yawn&mdash;but he could not
sleep yet. Tam might wake at any time, and maybe only stay awake a
short while. Rand had to be waiting when he did.</p>

<p>He grimaced and twisted in the chair, absently shifting the
sword hilt out of his ribs. He still felt backward about telling
anyone what Moiraine had said, but this was Tam, after all. This
was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Without realizing it he set his jaw determinedly. <em>My
father. I can tell my</em> father <em>anything</em>.</p>

<p>He twisted a little more in the chair and put his head against
the chair back. Tam was his father, and nobody could tell him what
to say or not say to his father. He just had to stay awake until
Tam woke up. He just had to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
