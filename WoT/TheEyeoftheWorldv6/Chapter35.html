<h4><em>Caemlyn</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">R</span>and
twisted up to kneel behind the driver&rsquo;s seat. He
could not help laughing with relief. &ldquo;We made it, Mat! I told you
we&rsquo;d&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Words died in his mouth as his eyes fell on Caemlyn.
After Baerlon, even more after the ruins of Shadar Logoth, he had
thought he knew what a great city would look like, but this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;this was more than he would have believed.</p>

<p>Outside the great wall, buildings clustered as if
every town he had passed through had been gathered and set down
there, side-by-side and all pushed together. Inns thrust their
upper stories above the tile roofs of houses, and squat warehouses,
broad and windowless, shouldered against them all. Red brick and
gray stone and plastered white, jumbled and mixed together, they
spread as far as the eye could see. Baerlon could have vanished
into it without being noticed, and Whitebridge swallowed up twenty
times over with hardly a ripple.</p>

<p>And the wall itself. The sheer, fifty-foot height of
pale gray stone, streaked with silver and white, swept out in a
great circle, curving to north and south till he wondered how far
it must run. All along its length towers rose, round and standing
high above the wall&rsquo;s own height, red-and-white banners whipping in
the wind atop each one. From inside the wall other towers peeked
out, slender towers even taller than those at the walls, and domes
gleaming white and gold in the sun. A thousand stories had painted
cities in his mind, the great cities of kings and queens, of
thrones and powers and legends, and Caemlyn fit into those
mind-deep pictures as water fits into a jug.</p>

<p>The cart creaked down the wide road toward the city,
toward tower-flanked gates. The wagons of a merchants&rsquo; train rolled
out of those gates, under a vaulting archway in the stone that
could have let a giant through, or ten giants abreast. Unwalled
markets lined the road on both sides, roof tiles glistening red and
purple, with stalls and pens in the spaces between. Calves bawled,
cattle lowed, geese honked, chickens clucked, goats bleated, sheep
baaed, and people bargained at the top of their lungs. A wall of
noise funneled them toward the gates of Caemlyn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; Bunt had to raise his voice to
near a shout in order to be heard. &ldquo;The grandest city in the world.
Built by Ogier, you know. Least, the Inner City and the Palace
were. It&rsquo;s that old, Caemlyn is. Caemlyn, where good Queen Morgase,
the Light illumine her, makes the law and holds the peace for
Andor. The greatest city on earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand was ready to agree. His mouth hung open, and he
wanted to put his hands over his ears to shut out the din. People
crowded the road, as thick as folk in Emond&rsquo;s Field crowded the
Green at Bel Tine. He remembered thinking there were too many
people in Baerlon to be believed, and almost laughed. He looked at
Mat and grinned. Mat did have his hands over his ears, and his
shoulders were hunched up as if he wanted to cover them with those,
too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are we going to hide in this?&rdquo; he demanded
loudly when he saw Rand looking. &ldquo;How can we tell who to trust with
so many? So bloody many. Light, the noise!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand looked at Bunt before answering. The farmer was
caught up in staring at the city; with the noise, he might not have
heard anyway. Still, Rand put his mouth close to Mat&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;How
can they find us among so many? Can&rsquo;t you see it, you wool-headed
idiot? We&rsquo;re safe, if you ever learn to watch your bloody tongue!&rdquo;
He flung out a hand to take in everything, the markets, the city
walls still ahead. &ldquo;Look at it, Mat! Anything could happen here.
Anything! We might even find Moiraine waiting for us, and Egwene,
and all the rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;re alive. If you ask me, they&rsquo;re as dead as
the gleeman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The grin faded from Rand&rsquo;s face, and he turned to
watch the gates come nearer. Anything could happen in a city like
Caemlyn. He held that thought stubbornly.</p>

<p>The horse could not move any faster, flap the reins
as Bunt would; the closer to the gates they came, the thicker the
crowd grew, jostling together shoulder to shoulder, pressing
against the carts and wagons heading in. Rand was glad to see a
good many were dusty young men afoot with little in the way of
belongings. Whatever their ages, a lot of the crowd pushing toward
the gates had a travel-worn look, rickety carts and tired horses,
clothes wrinkled from many nights of sleeping rough, dragging steps
and weary eyes. But weary or not, those eyes were fixed on the
gates as if getting inside the walls would strip away all their
fatigue.</p>

<p>Half a dozen of the Queen&rsquo;s Guards stood at the
gates, their clean red-and-white tabards and burnished
plate-and-mail a sharp contrast to most of the people streaming
under the stone arch. Backs rigid and heads straight, they eyed the
incomers with disdainful wariness. It was plain they would just as
soon have turned away most of those coming in. Aside from keeping a
way clear for traffic leaving the city, though, and having a hard
word with those who tried to push too fast, they did not hinder
anyone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep your places. Don&rsquo;t push. Don&rsquo;t push, the Light
blind you! There&rsquo;s room for everybody, the Light help us. Keep your
places.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bunt&rsquo;s cart rolled past the gates with the slow tide
of the throng, into Caemlyn.</p>

<p>The city rose on low hills, like steps climbing to a
center. Another wall encircled that center, shining pure white and
running over the hills. Inside that were even more towers and
domes, white and gold and purple, their elevation atop the hills
making them seem to look down on the rest of Caemlyn. Rand thought
that must be the Inner City of which Bunt had spoken.</p>

<p>The Caemlyn Road itself changed as soon as it was
inside the city, becoming a wide boulevard, split down the middle
by broad strips of grass and trees. The grass was brown and the
tree branches bare, but people hurried by as if they saw nothing
unusual, laughing, talking, arguing, doing all the things that
people do. Just as if they had no idea that there had been no
spring yet this year and might be none. They did not see, Rand
realized, could not or would not. Their eyes slid away from
leafless branches, and they walked across the dead and dying grass
without once looking down. What they did not see, they could
ignore; what they did not see was not really there.</p>

<p>Gaping at the city and the people, Rand was taken by
surprise when the cart turned down a side street, narrower than the
boulevard, but still twice as wide as any street in Emond&rsquo;s Field.
Bunt drew the horse to a halt and turned to look back at them
hesitantly. The traffic was a bit lighter here; the crowd split
around the cart without breaking stride.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you&rsquo;re hiding under your cloak, is it really
what Holdwin says?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand was in the act of tossing his saddlebags over
his shoulder. He did not even twitch. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; His voice
was steady, too. His stomach was a sour knot, but his voice was
steady.</p>

<p>Mat stifled a yawn with one hand, but he shoved the
other under his coat&mdash;clutching the dagger from Shadar
Logoth, Rand knew&mdash;and his eyes had a hard, hunted look under
the scarf around his head. Bunt avoided looking at Mat, as if he
knew there was a weapon in that hidden hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mean nothing, I suppose. Look, now, if you
heard I was coming to Caemlyn, you were there long enough to hear
the rest. Was I after a reward, I&rsquo;d have made some excuse to go in
the Goose and Crown, speak to Holdwin. Only I don&rsquo;t much like
Holdwin, and I don&rsquo;t like that friend of his, not at all. Seems
like he wants you two more than he wants&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;anything else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what he wants,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never
seen him before.&rdquo; It might even be the truth; he could not tell one
Fade from another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uh-huh. Well, like I say, I don&rsquo;t know nothing, and
I guess I don&rsquo;t want to. There&rsquo;s enough trouble around for
everybody without I go looking for more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat was slow in gathering his things, and Rand was
already in the street before he started climbing down. Rand waited
impatiently. Mat turned stiffly from the cart, hugging bow and
quiver and blanket roll to his chest, muttering under his breath.
Heavy shadows darkened the undersides of his eyes.</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s stomach rumbled, and he grimaced. Hunger
combined with a sour twisting in his gut made him afraid he was
going to vomit. Mat was staring at him now, expectantly. <em>Which
way to go? What to do now?</em></p>

<p>Bunt leaned over and beckoned him closer. He went,
hoping for advice about Caemlyn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hide that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; The old farmer paused and
looked around warily. People pushed by on both sides of the cart,
but except for a few passing curses about blocking the way, no one
paid them any attention. &ldquo;Stop wearing it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;hide it, sell
it. Give it away. That&rsquo;s my advice. Thing like that&rsquo;s going to draw
attention, and I guess you don&rsquo;t want any of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly he straightened, clucking to his horse, and
drove slowly on down the crowded street without another word or a
backward glance. A wagon loaded with barrels rumbled toward them.
Rand jumped out of the way, staggered, and when he looked again
Bunt and his cart were lost to sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do we do now?&rdquo; Mat demanded. He licked his
lips, staring wide-eyed at all the people pushing by and the
buildings towering as much as six stories above the street. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
in Caemlyn, but what do we do?&rdquo; He had uncovered his ears, but his
hands twitched as if he wanted to put them back. A hum lay on the
city, the low, steady drone of hundreds of shops working, thousands
of people talking. To Rand it was like being inside a giant
beehive, constantly buzzing. &ldquo;Even if they are here, Rand, how
could we find them in all of this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moiraine will find us,&rdquo; Rand said slowly. The
immensity of the city was a weight on his shoulders; he wanted to
get away, to hide from all the people and noise. The void eluded
him despite Tam&rsquo;s teachings; his eyes drew the city into it. He
concentrated instead on what was right around him, ignoring
everything that lay beyond. Just looking at that one street, it
almost seemed like Baerlon. Baerlon, the last place they had all
thought they were safe. <em>Nobody&rsquo;s safe anymore. Maybe they are
all dead. What do you do then?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re alive! Egwene&rsquo;s alive!&rdquo; he said fiercely.
Several passersby looked at him oddly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Mat said. &ldquo;Maybe. What if Moiraine doesn&rsquo;t
find us? What if nobody does but the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He shuddered,
unable to say it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll think about that when it happens,&rdquo; he told Mat
firmly. &ldquo;If it happens.&rdquo; The worst meant seeking out Elaida, the
Aes Sedai in the Palace. He would go on to Tar Valon, first. He did
not know if Mat remembered what Thom had said about the Red Ajah&mdash;and the Black&mdash;but he surely did. His stomach twisted
again. &ldquo;Thom said to find an inn called The Queen&rsquo;s Blessing. We&rsquo;ll
go there first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How? We can&rsquo;t afford one meal between the two of
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least it&rsquo;s a place to start. Thom thought we
could find help there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Rand, they&rsquo;re everywhere.&rdquo; Mat dropped
his eyes to the paving stones and seemed to shrink in on himself,
trying to pull away from the people that were all around them.
&ldquo;Wherever we go, they&rsquo;re right behind us, or they&rsquo;re waiting for
us. They&rsquo;ll be at The Queen&rsquo;s Blessing, too. I can&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Nothing&rsquo;s going to stop a Fade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand grabbed Mat&rsquo;s collar in a fist that he was
trying hard to keep from trembling. He needed Mat. Maybe the others
were alive&mdash;<em>Light, please!</em>&mdash;but right then and
there, it was just Mat and him. The thought of going on alone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He swallowed hard, tasting bile.</p>

<p>He looked around quickly. No one seemed to have heard
Mat mention the Fade; the crowd pressed past lost in its own
worries. He put his face close to Mat&rsquo;s. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made it this far,
haven&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; he asked in a hoarse whisper. &ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t caught us
yet. We can make it all the way, if we just don&rsquo;t quit. I won&rsquo;t
just quit and wait for them like a sheep for slaughter. I won&rsquo;t!
Well? Are you going to stand here till you starve to death? Or
until they come pick you up in a sack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He let go of Mat and turned away. His fingernails dug
into his palms, but his hands still trembled. Suddenly Mat was
walking alongside him, his eyes still down, and Rand let out a long
breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Rand,&rdquo; Mat mumbled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forget it,&rdquo; Rand said.</p>

<p>Mat barely looked up enough to keep from walking into
people while the words poured out in a lifeless voice. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
stop thinking I&rsquo;ll never see home again. I want to go home. Laugh
if you want; I don&rsquo;t care. What I wouldn&rsquo;t give to have my mother
blessing me out for something right now. It&rsquo;s like weights on my
brain; hot weights. Strangers all around, and no way to tell who to
trust, if I can trust anybody. Light, the Two Rivers is so far away
it might as well be on the other side of the world. We&rsquo;re alone,
and we&rsquo;ll never get home. We&rsquo;re going to die, Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet, we won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Rand retorted. &ldquo;Everybody dies.
The Wheel turns. I&rsquo;m not going to curl up and wait for it to
happen, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sound like Master al&rsquo;Vere,&rdquo; Mat grumbled, but
his voice had a little spirit in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;Good.&rdquo; <em>Light, let the others
be all right. Please don&rsquo;t let us be alone</em>.</p>

<p>He began asking directions to The Queen&rsquo;s Blessing.
The responses varied widely, a curse for all those who did not stay
where they belonged or a shrug and a blank look being the most
common. Some stalked on by with no more than a glance, if that.</p>

<p>A broad-faced man, nearly as big as Perrin, cocked
his head and said, &ldquo;The Queen&rsquo;s Blessing, eh? You country boys
Queen&rsquo;s men?&rdquo; He wore a white cockade on his wide-brimmed hat, and
a white armband on his long coat. &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve come too late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went off roaring with laughter, leaving Rand and
Mat to stare at one another in puzzlement. Rand shrugged; there
were plenty of odd folk in Caemlyn, people like he had never seen
before.</p>

<p>Some of them stood out in the crowd, skins too dark
or too pale, coats of strange cut or bright colors, hats with
pointed peaks or long feathers. There were women with veils across
their faces, women in stiff dresses as wide as the wearer was tall,
women in dresses that left more skin bare than any tavernmaid he
had seen. Occasionally a carriage, all vivid paint and gilt,
squeezed through the thronged streets behind a four- or
six-horse team with plumes on their harness. Sedan chairs were
everywhere, the polemen pushing along with never a care for who
they shoved aside.</p>

<p>Rand saw one fight start that way, a brawling heap of
men swinging their fists while a pale-skinned man in a red-striped
coat climbed out of the sedan chair lying on its side. Two roughly
dressed men, who seemed to have been just passing by up till then,
jumped on him before he was clear. The crowd that had stopped to
watch began to turn ugly, muttering and shaking fists. Rand pulled
at Mat&rsquo;s sleeve and hurried on. Mat needed no second urging. The
roar of a small riot followed them down the street.</p>

<p>Several times men approached the two of them instead
of the other way around. Their dusty clothes marked them as
newcomers, and seemed to act like a magnet on some types. Furtive
fellows who offered relics of Logain for sale with darting eyes and
feet set to run. Rand calculated he was offered enough scraps of
the false Dragon&rsquo;s cloak and fragments of his sword to make two
swords and half a dozen cloaks. Mat&rsquo;s face brightened with
interest, the first time at least, but Rand gave them all a curt
no, and they took it with a bob of the head and a quick, &ldquo;Light
illumine the Queen, good master,&rdquo; and vanished. Most of the shops
had plates and cups painted with fanciful scenes purporting to show
the false Dragon being displayed before the Queen in chains. And
there were Whitecloaks in the streets. Each walked in an open space
that moved with him, just as in Baerlon.</p>

<p>Staying unnoticed was something Rand thought about a
great deal. He kept his cloak over his sword, but that would not be
good enough for very long. Sooner or later someone would wonder
what he was hiding. He would not&mdash;could not&mdash;take
Bunt&rsquo;s advice to stop wearing it, not his link to Tam. To his
father.</p>

<p>Many others among the throng wore swords, but none
with the heron-mark to pull the eye. All the Caemlyn men, though,
and some of the strangers, had their swords wound in strips of
cloth, sheath and hilt, red bound with white cord, or white bound
with red. A hundred heron-marks could be hidden under those
wrappings and no one would see. Besides, following local fashion
would make them seem to fit in more.</p>

<p>A good many shops were fronted with tables displaying
the cloth and cord, and Rand stopped at one. The red cloth was
cheaper than the white, though he could see no difference apart
from the color, so he bought that and the white cord to go with it,
despite Mat&rsquo;s complaints about how little money they had left. The
tight-lipped shopkeeper eyed them up and down with a twist to his
mouth while he took Rand&rsquo;s coppers, and cursed them when Rand asked
for a place inside to wrap his sword.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t come to see Logain,&rdquo; Rand said patiently.
&ldquo;We just came to see Caemlyn.&rdquo; He remembered Bunt, and added, &ldquo;The
grandest city in the world.&rdquo; The shopkeeper&rsquo;s grimace remained in
place. &ldquo;The Light illumine good Queen Morgase,&rdquo; Rand said
hopefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You make any trouble,&rdquo; the man said sourly, &ldquo;and
there&rsquo;s a hundred men in sound of my voice will take care of you
even if the Guards won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He paused to spit, just missing Rand&rsquo;s
foot. &ldquo;Get on about your filthy business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand nodded as if the man had bid him a cheerful
farewell, and pulled Mat away. Mat kept looking back over his
shoulder toward the shop, growling to himself, until Rand tugged
him into an empty alleyway. With their backs to the street no
passerby could see what they were doing. Rand pulled off the sword
belt and set to wrapping the sheath and hilt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet he charged you double for that bloody
cloth,&rdquo; Mat said. &ldquo;Triple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not as easy as it looked, fastening the strips
of cloth and the cord so the whole thing would not fall off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll all be trying to cheat us, Rand. They think
we&rsquo;ve come to see the false Dragon, like everybody else. We&rsquo;ll be
lucky if somebody doesn&rsquo;t hit us on the head while we sleep. This
is no place to be. There are too many people. Let&rsquo;s leave for Tar
Valon now. Or south, to Illian. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind seeing them gather
for the Hunt of the Horn. If we can&rsquo;t go home, let&rsquo;s just go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m staying,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;If they&rsquo;re not here
already, they&rsquo;ll come here sooner or later, looking for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was not sure if he had the wrappings done the way
everyone else did, but the herons on scabbard and hilt were hidden
and he thought it was secure. As he went back out on the street, he
was sure that he had one less thing to worry about causing trouble.
Mat trailed along beside him as reluctantly as if he were being
pulled on a leash.</p>

<p>Bit by bit Rand did get the directions he wanted. At
first they were vague, on the order of &ldquo;somewhere in that
direction&rdquo; and &ldquo;over that way.&rdquo; The nearer they came, though, the
clearer the instructions, until at last they stood before a broad
stone building with a sign over the door creaking in the wind. A
man kneeling before a woman with red-gold hair and a crown, one of
her hands resting on his bowed head. The Queen&rsquo;s Blessing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure about this?&rdquo; Mat asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Rand said. He took a deep breath and
pushed open the door.</p>

<p>The common room was large and paneled with dark wood,
and fires on two hearths warmed it. A serving maid was sweeping the
floor, though it was clean, and another was polishing candlesticks
in the corner. Each smiled at the two newcomers before going back
to her work.</p>

<p>Only a few tables had people at them, but a dozen men
was a crowd for so early in the day, and if none looked exactly
happy to see him and Mat, at least they looked clean and sober. The
smells of roasting beef and baking bread drifted from the kitchen,
making Rand&rsquo;s mouth water.</p>

<p>The innkeeper was fat, he was pleased to see, a
pink-faced man in a starched white apron, with graying hair combed
back over a bald spot that it did not quite cover. His sharp eye
took them in from head to toe, dusty clothes and bundles and worn
boots, but he had a ready, pleasant smile, too. Basel Gill was his
name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Gill,&rdquo; Rand said, &ldquo;a friend of ours told us
to come here. Thom Merrilin. He&mdash;&rdquo; The innkeeper&rsquo;s smile
slipped. Rand looked at Mat, but he was too busy sniffing the
aromas coming from the kitchen to notice anything else. &ldquo;Is
something wrong? You do know him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know him,&rdquo; Gill said curtly. He seemed more
interested in the flute case at Rand&rsquo;s side now, than in anything
else. &ldquo;Come with me.&rdquo; He jerked his head toward the back. Rand gave
Mat a jerk to get him started, then followed, wondering what was
going on.</p>

<p>In the kitchen, Master Gill paused to speak to the
cook, a round woman with her hair in a bun at the back of her head
who almost matched the innkeeper pound for pound. She kept stirring
her pots while Master Gill talked. The smells were so good&mdash;two
days&rsquo; hunger made a fine sauce for anything, but this smelled as
good as Mistress al&rsquo;Vere&rsquo;s kitchen&mdash;that Rand&rsquo;s stomach
growled. Mat was leaning toward the pots, nose first. Rand nudged
him; Mat hastily wiped his chin where he had begun drooling.</p>

<p>Then the innkeeper was hurrying them out the back
door. In the stableyard he looked around to make sure no one was
close, then rounded on them. On Rand. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in the case,
lad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thom&rsquo;s flute,&rdquo; Rand said slowly. He opened the case,
as if showing the gold-and-silver-chased flute would help. Mat&rsquo;s
hand crept under his coat.</p>

<p>Master Gill did not take his eyes off Rand. &ldquo;Aye, I
recognize it. I saw him play it often enough, and there&rsquo;s not
likely two like that outside a royal court.&rdquo; The pleasant smiles
were gone, and his sharp eyes were suddenly as sharp as a knife.
&ldquo;How did you come by it? Thom would part with his arm as soon as
that flute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He gave it to me.&rdquo; Rand took Thom&rsquo;s bundled cloak
from his back and set it on the ground, unfolding enough to show
the colored patches, as well as the end of the harp case. &ldquo;Thom&rsquo;s
dead, Master Gill. If he was your friend, I&rsquo;m sorry. He was mine,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dead, you say. How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a man tried to kill us. Thom pushed this at
me and told us to run.&rdquo; The patches fluttered in the wind like
butterflies. Rand&rsquo;s throat caught; he folded the cloak carefully
back up again. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d have been killed if it hadn&rsquo;t been for him. We
were on our way to Caemlyn together. He told us to come here, to
your inn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll believe he&rsquo;s dead,&rdquo; the innkeeper said slowly,
&ldquo;when I see his corpse.&rdquo; He nudged the bundled cloak with his toe
and cleared his throat roughly. &ldquo;Nay, nay, I believe you saw
whatever it was you saw; I just don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s dead. He&rsquo;s a
harder man to kill than you might believe, is old Thom
Merrilin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand put a hand on Mat&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,
Mat. He&rsquo;s a friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master Gill glanced at Mat, and sighed. &ldquo;I suppose I
am at that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat straightened up slowly, folding his arms over his
chest. He was still watching the innkeeper warily, though, and a
muscle in his cheek twitched.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coming to Caemlyn, you say?&rdquo; The innkeeper shook his
head. &ldquo;This is the last place on earth I&rsquo;d expect Thom to come,
excepting maybe it was Tar Valon.&rdquo; He waited for a stableman to
pass, leading a horse, and even then he lowered his voice. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
trouble with the Aes Sedai, I take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Mat grumbled at the same time that Rand said,
&ldquo;What makes you think that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master Gill chuckled dryly. &ldquo;I know the man, that&rsquo;s
what. He&rsquo;d jump into that kind of trouble, especially to help a
couple of lads about the age of you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; The reminiscence in his
eyes flickered out, and he stood up straight with a chary look.
&ldquo;Now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not making any accusations, mind, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I take it neither of you can&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;what I&rsquo;m
getting at is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;what exactly is the nature of your
trouble with Tar Valon, if you don&rsquo;t mind my asking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s skin prickled as he realized what the man was
suggesting. The One Power. &ldquo;No, no, nothing like that. I swear.
There was even an Aes Sedai helping us. Moiraine was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He bit
his tongue, but the innkeeper&rsquo;s expression never changed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad to hear it. Not that I&rsquo;ve all that much love
for Aes Sedai, but better them than&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that other thing.&rdquo; He
shook his head slowly. &ldquo;Too much talk of that kind of thing, with
Logain being brought here. No offense meant, you understand, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well, I had to know, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No offense,&rdquo; Rand said. Mat&rsquo;s murmur could have been
anything, but the innkeeper appeared to take it for the same as
Rand had said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You two look the right sort, and I do believe you
were&mdash;are&mdash;friends of Thom, but it&rsquo;s hard times and
stony days. I don&rsquo;t suppose you can pay? No, I didn&rsquo;t think so.
There&rsquo;s not enough of anything, and what there is costs the earth,
so I&rsquo;ll give you beds&mdash;not the best, but warm and dry&mdash;and something to eat, and I cannot promise more, however much I&rsquo;d
like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Rand said with a quizzical glance at
Mat. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than I expected.&rdquo; What was the right sort, and why
<em>should</em> he promise more?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Thom&rsquo;s a good friend. An old friend.
Hot-headed and liable to say the worst possible thing to the one
person he shouldn&rsquo;t, but a good friend all the same. If he doesn&rsquo;t
show up&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well, we&rsquo;ll figure something out then. Best you don&rsquo;t
talk any more talk about Aes Sedai helping you. I&rsquo;m a good Queen&rsquo;s
man, but there are too many in Caemlyn right now who&rsquo;d take it
wrong, and I don&rsquo;t mean just the Whitecloaks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat snorted. &ldquo;For all I care, the ravens can take
every Aes Sedai straight to Shayol Ghul!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch your tongue,&rdquo; Master Gill snapped. &ldquo;I said I
don&rsquo;t love them; I didn&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m a fool thinks they&rsquo;re behind
everything that&rsquo;s wrong. The Queen supports Elaida, and the Guards
stand for the Queen. The Light send things don&rsquo;t go so bad that
changes. Anyway, lately some Guards have forgotten themselves
enough to be a little rough with folks they overhear speaking
against Aes Sedai. Not on duty, thank the Light, but it&rsquo;s happened,
just the same. I don&rsquo;t need off-duty Guards breaking up my common
room to teach you a lesson, and I don&rsquo;t need Whitecloaks egging
somebody on to paint the Dragon&rsquo;s Fang on my door, so if you want
any help out of me, you just keep thoughts about Aes Sedai to
yourself, good or bad.&rdquo; He paused thoughtfully, then added, &ldquo;Maybe
it&rsquo;s best you don&rsquo;t mention Thom&rsquo;s name, either, where anyone but
me can hear. Some of the Guards have long memories, and so does the
Queen. No need taking chances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thom had trouble with the Queen?&rdquo; Rand said
incredulously, and the innkeeper laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So he didn&rsquo;t tell you everything. Don&rsquo;t know why he
should. On the other hand, I don&rsquo;t know why you shouldn&rsquo;t know,
either. Not like it&rsquo;s a secret, exactly. Do you think every gleeman
thinks as much of himself as Thom does? Well, come to think of it,
I guess they do, but it always seemed to me Thom had an extra
helping of thinking a lot of himself. He wasn&rsquo;t always a gleeman,
you know, wandering from village to village and sleeping under a
hedge as often as not. There was a time Thom Merrilin was
Court-bard right here in Caemlyn, and known in every royal court
from Tear to Maradon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thom?&rdquo; Mat said.</p>

<p>Rand nodded slowly. He could picture Thom at a
Queen&rsquo;s court, with his stately manner and grand gestures.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That he was,&rdquo; Master Gill said. &ldquo;It was not long
after Taringail Damodred died that the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;trouble about his
nephew cropped up. There were some said Thom was, shall we say,
closer to the Queen than was proper. But Morgase was a young widow,
and Thom was in his prime, then, and the Queen can do as she wishes
is the way I look at it. Only she&rsquo;s always had a temper, has our
good Morgase, and he took off without a word when he learned what
kind of trouble his nephew was in. The Queen didn&rsquo;t much like that.
Didn&rsquo;t like him meddling in Aes Sedai matters, either. Can&rsquo;t say I
think it was right, either, nephew or no. Anyway, when he came
back, he said some words, all right. Words you don&rsquo;t say to a
Queen. Words you don&rsquo;t say to any woman with Morgase&rsquo;s spirit.
Elaida was set against him because of his trying to mix in the
business with his nephew, and between the Queen&rsquo;s temper and
Elaida&rsquo;s animosity, Thom left Caemlyn half a step ahead of a trip
to prison, if not the headsman&rsquo;s axe. As far as I know, the writ
still stands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it was a long time ago,&rdquo; Rand said, &ldquo;maybe nobody
remembers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master Gill shook his head. &ldquo;Gareth Bryne is
Captain-General of the Queen&rsquo;s Guards. He personally commanded the
Guardsmen Morgase sent to bring Thom back in chains, and I misdoubt
he&rsquo;ll ever forget returning empty-handed to find Thom had already
been back to the Palace and left again. And the Queen never forgets
<em>anything</em>. You ever know a woman who did? My, but Morgase
was in a taking. I&rsquo;ll swear the whole city walked soft and
whispered for a month. Plenty of other Guardsmen old enough to
remember, too. No, best you keep Thom as close a secret as you keep
that Aes Sedai of yours. Come, I&rsquo;ll get you something to eat. You
look as if your bellies are gnawing at your backbones.&rdquo;</p>
