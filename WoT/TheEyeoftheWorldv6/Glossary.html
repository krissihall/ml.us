<p class="drop"><em>A NOTE ON DATES IN THIS GLOSSARY</em>. The Toman
Calendar (devised by Toma dur Ahmid) was adopted approximately two
centuries after the death of the last male Aes Sedai and recorded
years After the Breaking of the World (AB). Many records were
destroyed in the Trolloc Wars, so much so that with the end of the
Wars there was argument about the exact year under the old system.
A new calendar was proposed by Tiam of Gazar, celebrating the
supposed freedom from the Trolloc threat and recording each year as
a Free Year (FY). The Gazaran calendar gained wide acceptance
within twenty years after the Wars&rsquo; end. Artur Hawkwing attempted
to establish a new calendar based on the founding of his empire
(FF, From the Founding), but this is now known and referred to only
by historians. After the widespread destruction, death and
disruption of the War of the Hundred Years, a fourth calendar was
devised by Uren din Jubai Soaring Gull, a scholar of the Sea Folk,
and promulgated by the Panarch Farede of Tarabon. The Farede
Calendar, dating from the arbitrarily-decided end of the War of the
Hundred Years and recording years of the New Era (NE), is currently
in use.</p>

<dl>
<dt><em><strong>Adan, Heran</strong></em> (<em>ay-DAN,
HEH-ran</em>):</dt>
<dd>Governor of Baerlon.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Aes Sedai</strong></em> (<em>EYEZ seh-DEYE</em>):</dt>
<dd>Wielders of the One Power. Since the Time of Madness, all surviving
Aes Sedai are women. Widely distrusted and feared, even hated, they
are blamed by many for the Breaking of the World, and are generally
thought to meddle in the affairs of nations. At the same time, few
rulers will be without an Aes Sedai adviser, even in lands where
the existence of such a connection must be kept secret. Used as an
honorific, so: Sheriam Sedai; and as a high honorific, so: Sheriam
Aes Sedai. <em>See also</em> Ajah; Amyrlin Seat.</dd>

<dt><strong><em>Age Lace</em></strong>:</dt>
<dd> <em>See</em> Pattern of an Age.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Age of Legends</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>The Age ended by the
War of the Shadow and the Breaking of the World. A time when Aes
Sedai performed wonders now only dreamed of. <em>See also</em> Wheel of
Time.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Agelmar; Lord Agelmar of House of
Jagad</strong></em> (<em>AGH-el-mar; JAH-gad</em>):</dt>
<dd>Lord of Fal
Dara. His sign is three running red foxes.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Aiel</strong></em> (<em>eye-EEL</em>):</dt>
<dd>The people of
the Aiel Waste. Fierce and hardy. Also called Aielmen. They veil
their faces before they kill, giving rise to the saying &ldquo;acting
like a black-veiled Aiel&rdquo; to describe someone who is being violent.
Deadly warriors with weapons or with nothing but their bare hands,
they will not touch a sword. Their pipers play them into battle
with the music of dances, and Aielmen call battle &ldquo;the Dance.&rdquo;</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Aiel Waste</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>The harsh, rugged and
all-but-waterless land east of the Spine of the World. Few
outsiders venture there, not only because water is almost
impossible to find for one not born there, but because the Aiel
consider themselves at war with all other peoples and do not
welcome strangers.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Ajah</strong></em> (<em>AH-jah</em>):</dt>
<dd>Societies
among the Aes Sedai, to which all Aes Sedai belong. They are
designated by colors: Blue Ajah, Red Ajah, White Ajah, Green Ajah,
Brown Ajah, Yellow Ajah, and Gray Ajah. Each follows a specific
philosophy of the use of the One Power and purposes of the Aes
Sedai. For example, the Red Ajah bends all its energies to finding
and gentling men who are attempting to wield the Power. The Brown
Ajah, on the other hand, forsakes involvement with the world and
dedicates itself to seeking knowledge. There are rumors (hotly
denied, and never safely mentioned in front of any Aes Sedai) of a
Black Ajah, dedicated to serving the Dark One.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Breaking of the World, the</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>When
Lews Therin Telamon and the Hundred Companions resealed the Dark
One&rsquo;s prison, the counterstroke tainted <em>saidin</em>. Eventually every
male Aes Sedai went horribly insane. In their madness these men,
who could wield the One Power to a degree now unknown, changed the
face of the earth. They caused great earthquakes, leveled mountain
ranges, raised new mountains, lifted dry land where seas had been,
made the ocean rush in where dry land had been. Many parts of the
world were completely depopulated, and the survivors were scattered
like dust on the wind. This destruction is remembered in stories,
legends and history as the Breaking of the World. <em>See also</em> Hundred

One and the destruction of all Darkfriends. Founded during the War
of the Hundred Years by Lothair Mantelar (<em>LOH-thayr
MAHNtee-LAHR</em>) to proselytize against increasing numbers of
Darkfriends, they evolved during the war into a completely military
organization, extremely rigid in their beliefs and completely
certain that only they know the truth and the right. They hate Aes
Sedai, considering them, and any who support or befriend them,
Darkfriends. They are known disparagingly as Whitecloaks; their
sign is a golden sunburst on a field of white.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Covenant of the Ten Nations</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>A
union formed in the centuries after the Breaking of the World
(circa 200 AB). Dedicated to the defeat of the Dark One.
Broken apart by the Trolloc Wars.</dd>

(<em>DAHM-oh-drehd, TAH-rihn-gail</em>):</dt>
<dd>A Royal Prince of Cairhien, he
married Tigraine and fathered Galadedrid. When Tigraine disappeared
and was declared dead, he married Morgase and fathered Elayne and
Gawyn. He vanished under mysterious circumstances and has been
presumed dead for many years. His sign was a golden, double-bitted
battle axe.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Dark One</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>Most common name, used
in every land, for Shai&rsquo;tan: the source of evil, antithesis of the
Creator. Imprisoned by the Creator at the moment of Creation in a
prison at Shayol Ghul; an attempt to free him from that prison
brought about the War of the Shadow, the tainting of <em>saidin</em>, the
Breaking of the World, and the end of the Age of Legends.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Dark One, naming the</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>Saying the
true name of the Dark One (Shai&rsquo;tan) draws his attention,
inevitably bringing ill-fortune at best, disaster at worst. For
that reason many euphemisms are used, among them the Dark One,
Father of Lies, Sightblinder, Lord of the Grave, Shepherd of the
Night, Heartsbane, Heartfang, Grassburner, and Leafblighter.
Someone who seems to be inviting ill fortune is often said to be
&ldquo;naming the Dark One.&rdquo;</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Darkfriends</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>Those who follow the
Dark One and believe they will gain great power and rewards when he
is freed from his prison.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Daughter-heir</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>Title of the heir
to the throne of Andor. The eldest daughter of the Queen succeeds
her mother on the throne. Without a surviving daughter, the throne
goes to the nearest female blood-relation of the Queen.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Dha&rsquo;vol, Dhai&rsquo;mon</strong></em> (<em>DAH-vohl,
DEYE-mon</em>):</dt>
<dd><em>See</em> Trollocs.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Djevik K&rsquo;Shar</strong></em> (<em>DJEH-vihk
KEH-SHAHR</em>):</dt>

Trolloc name for the Aiel Waste.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Domon, Bayle</strong></em> (<em>DOH-mon, BAIL</em>):</dt>
<dd>The captain of the <em>Spray</em>.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Dragon, the</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>The name by which
Lews Therin Telamon was known during the War of the Shadow. In the
madness which overtook all male Aes Sedai, Lews Therin killed every
living person who carried any of his blood, as well as everyone he
loved, thus earning the name Kinslayer. A saying is now used,
&ldquo;taken by the Dragon,&rdquo; or &ldquo;possessed of the Dragon,&rdquo; to indicate
that someone is endangering those around him or threatening them,
especially if without cause. <em>See also</em> Dragon Reborn.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Dragon, false</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>Occasionally men
claim to be the Dragon Reborn, and sometimes one of them gains
following enough to require an army to put it down. Some have begun
wars that involved many nations. Over the centuries most have been
men unable to channel the One Power, but a few could. All, however,
either disappeared, or were captured or killed, without fulfilling
any of the Prophecies concerning the Rebirth of the Dragon. These
men are called false Dragons. <em>See also</em> Dragon reborn.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Dragon Reborn</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>According to
prophecy and legend the Dragon will be born again at mankind&rsquo;s
greatest hour of need to save the world. This is not something
people look forward to, both because the prophecies say the Dragon
Reborn will bring a new Breaking to the world, and because Lews
Therin Kinslayer, the Dragon, is a name to make men shudder, even
more than three thousand years after his death. <em>See also</em> Dragon,
the; Dragon, false.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Dragon&rsquo;s Fang, the</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>A stylized
mark, usually black, in the shape of a teardrop balanced on its
point. Scrawled on a door or a house, it is an accusation of evil
against the people inside.</dd>

who, able to channel the One Power, went over to the Shadow during
the Trolloc Wars, acting as commanders of the Trolloc
forces.</dd>

(<em>EE-zar; toh-GHEE-rah</em>):</dt>
<dd>King of Shienar. His sign is a

a sign of Shienar along with the Black Hawk.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Elaida</strong></em> (<em>eh-LY-da</em>):</dt>
<dd>An Aes
Sedai who advises Queen Morgase of Andor.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Elayne</strong></em> (<em>ee-LAIN</em>):</dt>

sign is a golden lily.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Else; Else Grinwell</strong></em> (<em>EHLZ
GRIHN-wehl</em>):</dt>
<dd>A farmer&rsquo;s daughter met on the Caemlyn Road.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Eyeless, the</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd><em>See</em>
Myrddraal.</dd>
<dd><br></dd>
<dt><em><strong>Fade</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd><em>See</em> Myrddraal.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Fain, Padan</strong></em> (<em>FAIN, PAHD-ahn</em>):</dt>
<dd>A peddler who arrives in Emond&rsquo;s Field just before Winternight.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Far Dareis Mai</strong></em> (<em>FAHR DAH-rize
MY</em>):</dt>
<dd>Literally, &ldquo;Maidens of the Spear.&rdquo; One of a number of
warrior societies of the Aiel; unlike any of the others, it admits
women and only women. A Maiden may not marry and remain in the
society, nor may she fight while carrying a child. Any child born
to a Maiden is given to another woman to raise, in such a way that
no one knows who the child&rsquo;s mother was. (&ldquo;You may belong to no
man, nor may any man belong to you, nor any child. The spear is
your lover, your child, and your life.&rdquo;) These children are
treasured, for it is prophesied that a child born of a Maiden will
unite the clans and return to the Aiel to the greatness they knew
during the Age of Legends.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Farstrider, Jain</strong></em> (<em>JAY-ihn</em>):</dt>
<dd>A
hero of the northern lands who journeyed to many lands and had many
adventures; the author of several books, as well as being the
subject of books and stories. He vanished in 981 NE, after
returning from a trip into the Great Blight which some said had
taken him all the way to Shayol Ghul.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Father of Lies</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd><em>See</em> Dark
One.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>First Prince of the Sword</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>Title
normally held by the eldest brother of the Queen of Andor, who has
been trained since childhood to command the Queen&rsquo;s armies in time
of war and to be her adviser in time of peace. If the Queen has no
surviving brother, she will appoint someone to the title.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>fist</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>The basic military unit of
the Trollocs, varying in number; always more than one hundred, but
never more than two hundred. A fist is usually, but not always,
commanded by a Myrddraal.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Five Powers, the</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>There are
threads to the One Power, and each person who can channel the One
Power can usually grasp some threads better than others. These
threads are named according to the sorts of things that can be done
using them&mdash;Earth, Air, Fire, Water, and Spirit&mdash;and are
called the Five Powers. Any wielder of the One Power will have a
greater degree of strength with one, or possibly two, of these, and
lesser strength in the others. Some few may have great strength
with three, but since the Age of Legends no one has had great
strength with all five. Even then this was extremely rare. The
degree of strength can vary greatly between individuals, so that
some who can channel are much stronger than others. Performing
certain acts with the One Power requires ability in one or more of
the Five Powers. For example, starting or controlling a fire
requires Fire, and affecting the weather requires Air and Water,
while Healing requires Water and Spirit. While Spirit was found
equally in men and women, great ability with Earth and/or Fire was
found much more often among men, with Water and/or Air among women.
There were exceptions, but it was so often so that Earth and Fire
came to be regarded as male Powers, Air and Water as female.
Generally, no ability is considered stronger than any other, though
there is a saying among Aes Sedai: &ldquo;There is no rock so strong that
water and wind cannot wear it away, no fire so fierce that water
cannot quench it or wind snuff it out.&rdquo; It should be noted this
saying came into use long after the last male Aes Sedai was dead.
Any equivalent saying among male Aes Sedai is long lost.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Flame of Tar Valon</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>The symbol of
Tar Valon and the Aes Sedai. A stylized representation of a flame;
a white teardrop with the point upward.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Forsaken, the</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>Name given to
thirteen of the most powerful Aes Sedai ever known, who went over
to the Dark One during the War of the Shadow in return for the
promise of immortality. According to both legend and fragmentary
records, they were imprisoned along with the Dark One when his
prison was resealed. Their names are still used to frighten
children.</dd>
<dd><br></dd>
<dt><em><strong>Galad</strong></em> (<em>gah-LAHD</em>):</dt>
<dd><em>See</em>
Damodred, Lord Galadedrid.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Gawyn</strong></em> (<em>GAH-wihn</em>):</dt>
<dd>Queen
Morgase&rsquo;s son, Elayne&rsquo;s brother, who will be First Prince of the
Sword when Elayne ascends the throne. His sign is a white boar.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>gentling</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>The act, performed by
Aes Sedai, of shutting off a male who can channel from the One
Power. This is necessary because any man who learns to channel will
go insane from the taint upon <em>saidin</em> and will almost certainly
do horrible things with the Power in his madness. A man who has
been gentled can still sense the True Source, but he cannot touch
it. Whatever madness has come before gentling is arrested by the
act of gentling, but not cured by it, and if it is done soon enough
death can be averted.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>gleeman</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>A traveling storyteller,
musician, juggler, tumbler and all-around entertainer. Known by
their trademark cloaks of many-colored patches, they perform mainly
in the villages and smaller towns, since larger towns and cities
have other entertainments available.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Great Blight, the</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>A region in the
far north, entirely corrupted by the Dark One. A haunt of Trollocs,
Myrddraal, and other creatures of the Dark One.</dd>

<dd>A
cycle of stories concerning the legendary search for the Horn of
Valere, in the years between the end of the Trolloc Wars and the
beginning of the War of the Hundred Years. If told in their
entirety, the cycle would take many days.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Great Lord of the Dark</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>The name
by which Darkfriends refer to the Dark One, claiming that to use
his true name would be blasphemous.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Great Pattern</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>The Wheel of Time
weaves the Patterns of the Ages into the Great Pattern, which is
the whole of existence and reality, past, present and future. Also
known as the Lace of Ages. <em>See also</em> Pattern of an Age; Wheel of
Time.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Great Serpent</strong></em>:</dt>

<dd>One
hundred male Aes Sedai, among the most powerful of the Age of
Legends, who, led by Lews Therin Telamon, launched the final stroke
that ended the War of the Shadow by sealing the Dark One back into
his prison. The Dark One&rsquo;s counterstroke tainted <em>saidin</em>; the
Hundred Companions went mad and began the Breaking of the
World.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Illian</strong></em> (<em>IHL-lee-ahn</em>):</dt>
<dd>A great
port on the Sea of Storms, capital city of the nation of the same

(<em>TRAHK-ahnd</em>). Her sign is three golden keys. The sign of
House Trakand is a silver keystone.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Myrddraal</strong></em> (<em>MUHRD-draal</em>):</dt>
<dd>Creatures of the Dark One, commanders of the Trollocs. Twisted
offspring of Trollocs in which the human stock used to create the
Trollocs has resurfaced, but tainted by the evil that made the
Trollocs. Physically they are like men except that they have no
eyes, but can see like eagles in light or dark. They have certain
powers stemming from the Dark One, including the ability to cause
paralyzing fear with a look and the ability to vanish wherever
there are shadows. One of their few known weaknesses is that they
are reluctant to cross running water. In different lands they are
known by many names, among them Halfmen, the Eyeless, Shadowmen,
Lurk, and Fade.</dd>
<dd><br></dd>
<dt><em><strong>One Power, the</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>The power drawn
from the True Source. The vast majority of people are completely
unable to learn to channel the One Power. A very small number can
be taught to channel, and an even tinier number have the ability
inborn. For these few there is no need to be taught; they will
touch the True Source and channel the Power whether they want to or
not, perhaps without even realizing what they are doing. This
inborn ability usually manifests itself in late adolescence or
early adulthood. If control is not taught, or self-learned
(extremely difficult, with a success rate of only one in
four), death is certain. Since the time of Madness, no man has been
able to channel the Power without eventually going completely,
horribly mad; and then, even if he has learned some control, dying
from a wasting sickness which causes the sufferer to rot alive&mdash;a sickness caused, as is the madness, by the Dark One&rsquo;s
taint on <em>saidin</em>. For a woman the death that comes without control
of the Power is less horrible, but it is death just the same. Aes
Sedai search for girls with the inborn ability as much to save
their lives as to increase Aes Sedai numbers, and for men with it
in order to stop the terrible things they inevitably do with the
Power in their madness. <em>See also</em> channel; Time of Madness; True
Source.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Pattern of an Age</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>The Wheel of

which forms the substance of reality for that Age; also known as
Age Lace. <em>See also</em> ta&rsquo;veren.</dd>
<dd><br></dd>
<dt><em><strong>Questioners, the</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>An order within
the Children of the Light. Their avowed purposes are discovering
the truth in disputations and uncovering Darkfriends. In the search
for truth and the Light, as they see it, they are even more zealous
than the Children of the Light as a whole. Their normal method of
inquiry is by torture; their normal attitude that they know the
truth already and must only make their victim confess to it. The
Questioners refer to themselves as the Hand of the Light, and at
times act as if they were entirely separate from the Children and
the Council of the Anointed, which commands the Children. The head
of the Questioners is the High Inquisitor, who sits on the Council
of the Annointed.</dd>

<dd>An extremely rare object which allows
an individual to channel much more of the One Power than would
otherwise be possible or safe. A <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em> is like unto, but much,
much more powerful than, an <em>angreal</em> . Remnants of the Age
of Legends, the means of their making is no longer known.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>stedding</strong></em> (<em>STEHD-ding</em>):</dt>
<dd>An
Ogier (<em>OH geer</em>) homeland. Many <em>stedding</em> have been
abandoned since the Breaking of the World. They are portrayed in
story and legend as havens, and with reason. They are shielded in
some way, no longer understood, so that within them no Aes Sedai
can channel the One Power, nor even sense that the True Source
exists. Attempts to wield the One Power from outside a <em>stedding</em>
have no effect inside a <em>stedding</em> boundary. No Trolloc will enter a
<em>stedding</em> unless driven, and even a Myrddraal will do so only at the
greatest need and then with the greatest reluctance and distaste.
Even Darkfriends, if truly dedicated, feel uncomfortable within a
<em>stedding</em>.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Stone of Tear</strong></em>:</dt>

son Galadedrid. Her disappearance in 972 NE, shortly after her
brother Luc vanished in the Blight, led to the struggle in Andor
called the Succession, and caused the events in Cairhien which
eventually brought on the Aiel War. Her sign was a woman&rsquo;s hand
gripping a thorny rose-stem with a white blossom.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Trolloc Wars</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>A series of wars,
beginning about 1000 AB and lasting more than three hundred years,
during which Trolloc armies ravaged the world. Eventually the
Trollocs were slain or driven back into the Great Blight, but some
nations ceased to exist, while others were almost depopulated. All
records of the time are fragmentary. <em>See also</em> Covenant of the Ten
Nations.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Trollocs</strong></em> (<em>TRAHL-lohks</em>):</dt>
<dd>Creatures of the Dark One, created during the War of the Shadow.
Huge in stature, vicious in the extreme, they are a twisted blend
of animal and human stock, and kill for the pure pleasure of
killing. Sly, deceitful and treacherous, they can be trusted only
by those they fear. They are omnivorous and will eat any kind of
meat, including human flesh and the flesh of other Trollocs.
Largely of human origin, they are able to interbreed with
humankind, but the offspring are usually stillborn, and those which
are not often fail to survive. They are divided into tribe-like
bands, chief among them being the Ahf&rsquo;frait, Al&rsquo;ghol, Bhan&rsquo;sheen,
Dha&rsquo;vol, Dhai&rsquo;mon, Dhjin&rsquo;nen, Ghar&rsquo;ghael, Ghob&rsquo;hlin, Gho&rsquo;hlem,
Ghraem&rsquo;lan, Ko&rsquo;bal, and the Kno&rsquo;mon.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>True Source</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>The driving force of
the universe, which turns the Wheel of Time. It is divided into a
male half (<em>saidin</em>) and a female half (<em>saidar</em>), which
work at the same time with and against each other. Only a man can
draw on <em>saidin</em>, only a woman on <em>saidar</em>. Since the beginning of the
Time of Madness, <em>saidin</em> has been tainted by the Dark One&rsquo;s touch.
<em>See also</em> One Power.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Tuatha&rsquo;an</strong></em> (<em>too-AH-thah-AHN</em>):</dt>
<dd>A wandering folk, also known as the Tinkers and as the Traveling
People, who live in brightly painted wagons and follow a totally
pacifist philosophy called the Way of the Leaf. Things mended by
Tinkers are often better than new, but the Tuatha&rsquo;an are shunned by
many villages because of stories that they steal children and try
to convert young people to their beliefs.</dd>
<dd><br></dd>
<dt><em><strong>Village Council</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>In most villages
a group of men, elected by the townsmen and headed by a Mayor, who
are responsible for making decisions which affect the village as a
whole and for negotiating with the Councils of other villages over
matters which affect the villages jointly. They are at odds with
the Women&rsquo;s Circle in so many villages that this conflict is seen
as almost traditional. <em>See also</em> Women&rsquo;s Circle.</dd>
<dd><br></dd>
<dt><em><strong>War of the Hundred Years</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>A series
of overlapping wars among constantly shifting alliances,
precipitated by the death of Artur Hawkwing and the resulting
struggle for his empire. It lasted from FY 994 to FY 1117. The war
depopulated large parts of the lands between the Aryth Ocean and
the Aiel Waste, from the Sea of Storms to the Great Blight. So
great was the destruction that only fragmentary records of the time
remain. The empire of Artur Hawkwing was pulled apart, and the
nations of the present day were formed.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>War of the Shadow</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>Also known as
the War of Power, it ended the Age of Legends. It began shortly
after the attempt to free the Dark One, and soon involved the whole
world. In a world where even the memory of war had been forgotten,
every facet of war was rediscovered, often twisted by the Dark
One&rsquo;s touch on the World, and the One Power was used as a weapon.
The war was ended by the resealing of the Dark One into his
prison.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Warder</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>A warrior bonded to an Aes
Sedai. The bonding is a thing of the One Power, and by it he gains
such gifts as quick healing, the ability to go long periods without
food, water or rest, and the ability to sense the taint of the Dark
One at a distance. So long as a Warder lives, the Aes Sedai to whom
he is bonded knows he is alive however far away he is, and when he
dies she will know the moment and manner of his death. While most
Ajahs believe an Aes Sedai may have one Warder bonded to her at a
time, the Red Ajah refuses to bond any Warders at all, while the
Green Ajah believes an Aes Sedai may bond as many Warders as she
wishes. Ethically the Warder must accede to the bonding, but it has
been known to be done involuntarily. What the Aes Sedai gain from
the bonding is a closely-held secret. <em>See also</em> Aes Sedai.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Web of Destiny</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>A great change in
the Pattern of an Age, centered around one or more people who are
ta&rsquo;veren.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Wheel of time, the</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>Time is a
wheel with seven spokes, each spoke an Age. As the Wheel turns, the
Ages come and go, each leaving memories that fade to legend, then
to myth, and are forgotten by the time that Age comes again. The
Pattern of an Age is slightly different each time an Age comes, and
each time it is subject to greater change, but each time it is the
same Age.</dd>

Amyrlin Seat in Tar Valon.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Whitecloaks</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd><em>See</em> Children of the

<dt><em><strong>Wisdom</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>In villages, a woman
chosen by the Women&rsquo;s Circle to sit in the Circle for her knowledge
of such things as healing and foretelling the weather, as well as
for common, good sense. A position of great responsibility and
authority, both actual and implied. She is generally considered the
equal of the Mayor, and in some villages his superior. Unlike the
Mayor, she is chosen for life, and it is very rare for a Wisdom to
be removed from office before her death. Almost traditionally in
conflict with the Mayor. <em>See also</em> Women&rsquo;s Circle.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>Women&rsquo;s Circle</strong></em>:</dt>
<dd>A group of women
elected by the women of a village, responsible for deciding such
matters as are considered solely women&rsquo;s responsibility (for
example, when to plant the crops and when to harvest). Equal in
authority to the Village Council, with clearly-delineated lines and
areas of responsibility. Often at odds with the Village Council.
