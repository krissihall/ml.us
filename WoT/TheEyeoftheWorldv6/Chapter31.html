narrowed his eyes, watching the dust-tail that
rose ahead, three or four bends of the road away. Mat was already
headed toward the wild hedgerow alongside the roadway. Its
evergreen leaves and densely intermeshed branches would hide them
as well as a stone wall, if they could find a way through to the
other side. The other side of the road was marked by the sparse
brown skeletons of head-high bushes, and beyond was an open field
for half a mile to the woods. It might have been part of a farm not
too long abandoned, but it offered no quick hiding place. He tried
to judge the speed of the dust-tail, and the wind.</p>

<p>A sudden gust swirled road dust up around him,
obscuring everything. He blinked and adjusted the plain, dark scarf
across his nose and mouth. None too clean now, it made his face
itch, but it kept him from inhaling dust with every breath. A
farmer had given it to him, a long-faced man with grooves in his
cheeks from worry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re running from,&rdquo; he had said
with an anxious frown, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t want to. You understand? My
family.&rdquo; Abruptly the farmer had dug two long scarves out of his
coat pocket and pushed the tangle of wool at them. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not much,
but here. Belong to my boys. They have others. You don&rsquo;t know me,
understand? It&rsquo;s hard times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand treasured the scarf. The list of kindnesses he
had made in his mind in the days since Whitebridge was a short one,
and he did not believe it would get much longer.</p>

<p>Mat, all but his eyes hidden by the scarf wrapped
around his head, hunted swiftly along the tall hedgerow, pulling at
the leafy branches. Rand touched the heron-marked hilt at his belt,
but let his hand fall away. Once already, cutting a hole through a
hedge had almost given them away. The dust-tail was moving toward
them, and staying together too long. Not the wind. At least it was
not raining. Rain settled the dust. No matter how hard it fell, it
never turned the hard-packed road to mud, but when it rained there
was no dust. Dust was the only warning they had before whoever it
was came close enough to hear. Sometimes that was too late.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; Mat called softly. He seemed to step right
through the hedge.</p>

<p>Rand hurried to the spot. Someone had cut a hole
there, once. It was partly grown over, and from three feet away it
looked as solid as the rest, but close up there was only a thin
screen of branches. As he pushed through, he heard horses coming.
Not the wind.</p>

<p>He crouched behind the barely covered opening,
clutching the hilt of his sword as the horsemen rode by. Five&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;six&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;seven of them. Plainly dressed men, but swords and spears
said they were not villagers. Some wore leather tunics with metal
studs, and two had round steel caps. Merchants&rsquo; guards, perhaps,
between hirings. Perhaps.</p>

<p>One of them casually swung his eyes toward the hedge
as he went by the opening, and Rand bared an inch of his sword. Mat
snarled silently like a cornered badger, squinting above his scarf.
His hand was under his coat; he always clutched the dagger from
Shadar Logoth when there was danger. Rand was no longer sure if it
was to protect himself or to protect the ruby-hilted dagger. Of
late Mat seemed to forget he had a bow, sometimes.</p>

<p>The riders passed at a slow trot, going somewhere
with a purpose but not too great a haste. Dust sifted through the
hedge.</p>

<p>Rand waited until the clop of the hooves faded before
he stuck his head cautiously back through the hole. The dust-tail
was well down the road, going the way they had come. Eastward the
sky was clear. He climbed out onto the roadway, watching the column
of dust move west.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not after us,&rdquo; he said, halfway between a statement
and a question.</p>

<p>Mat scrambled out after him, looking warily in both
directions. &ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand had no idea which way he meant it, but he
nodded. Maybe. It had not begun like this, their journey down the
Caemlyn Road.</p>

<p>For a long time after leaving Whitebridge, Rand would
suddenly find himself staring back down the road behind them.
Sometimes he would see someone who made his breath catch, a tall,
skinny man hurrying up the road, or a lanky, white-haired fellow up
beside the driver on a wagon, but it was always a pack-peddler, or
farmers making their way to market, never Thom Merrilin. Hope faded
as the days passed.</p>

<p>There was considerable traffic on the road, wagons
and carts, people on horses and people afoot. They came singly and
in groups, a train of merchants&rsquo; wagons or a dozen horsemen
together. They did not jam the road, and often there was nothing in
sight except the all but leafless trees lining the hard-packed
roadbed, but there were certainly more people traveling than Rand
had ever seen in the Two Rivers.</p>

<p>Most traveled in the same direction that they did,
eastward toward Caemlyn. Sometimes they got a ride in a farmer&rsquo;s
wagon for a little distance, a mile, or five, but more often they
walked. Men on horseback they avoided; when they spotted even one
rider in the distance they scrambled off the road and hid until he
was past. None ever wore a black cloak, and Rand did not really
think a Fade would let them see him coming, but there was no point
in taking chances. In the beginning it was just the Halfmen they
feared.</p>

<p>The first village after Whitebridge looked so much
like Emond&rsquo;s Field that Rand&rsquo;s steps dragged when he saw it.
Thatched roofs with high peaks, and goodwives in their aprons
gossiping over the fences between their houses, and children
playing on a village green. The women&rsquo;s hair hung unbraided around
their shoulders, and other small things were different, too, but
the whole together was like home. Cows cropped on the green, and
geese waddled self-importantly across the road. The children
tumbled, laughing, in the dust where the grass was gone altogether.
They did not even look around when Rand and Mat went by. That was
another thing that was different. Strangers were no oddity there;
two more did not draw so much as a second glance. Village dogs only
raised their heads to sniff as he and Mat passed; none stirred
themselves.</p>

<p>It was coming on evening as they went through the
village, and he felt a pang of homesickness as lights appeared in
the windows. <em>No matter what it looks like</em>, a small voice
whispered in his mind, <em>it isn&rsquo;t really home. Even if you go
into one of those houses Tam won&rsquo;t be there. If he was, could you
look him in the face? You know, now, don&rsquo;t you? Except for little
things like where you come from and who you are. No
fever-dreams</em>. He hunched his shoulders against taunting
laughter inside his head. <em>You might as well stop</em>, the
voice snickered. <em>One place it as good as another when you
aren&rsquo;t from anywhere, and the Dark One has you marked</em>.</p>

<p>Mat tugged at his sleeve, but he pulled loose and
stared at the houses. He did not want to stop, but he did want to
look and remember. <em>So much like home, but you&rsquo;ll never see that
again, will you?</em></p>

<p>Mat yanked at him again. His face was taut, the skin
around his mouth and eyes white. &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; Mat muttered. &ldquo;Come
on.&rdquo; He looked at the village as if he suspected something of
hiding there. &ldquo;Come on. We can&rsquo;t stop yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand turned in a complete circle, taking in the whole
village, and sighed. They were not very far from Whitebridge. If
the Myrddraal could get past Whitebridge&rsquo;s wall without being seen,
it would have no trouble at all searching this small village. He
let himself be drawn on into the countryside beyond, until the
thatch-roofed houses were left behind.</p>

<p>Night fell before they found a spot by moonlight,
under some bushes still bearing their dead leaves. They filled
their bellies with cold water from a shallow rivulet not far away
and curled up on the ground, wrapped in their cloaks, without a
fire. A fire could be seen; better to be cold.</p>

<p>Uneasy with his memories, Rand woke often, and every
time he could hear Mat muttering and tossing in his sleep. He did
not dream, that he could remember, but he did not sleep well.
<em>You&rsquo;ll never see home again</em>.</p>

<p>That was not the only night they spent with just
their cloaks to protect them from the wind, and sometimes the rain,
cold and soaking. It was not the only meal they made from nothing
but cold water. Between them they had enough coins for a few meals
at an inn, but a bed for the night would take too much. Things cost
more outside the Two Rivers, more this side of the Arinelle than in
Baerlon. What money they had left had to be saved for an
emergency.</p>

<p>One afternoon Rand mentioned the dagger with the ruby
in its hilt, while they were trudging down the road with bellies
too empty to rumble, and the sun low and weak, and nothing in view
for the coming night but more bushes. Dark clouds built up overhead
for rain during the night. He hoped they were lucky; maybe no more
than an icy drizzle.</p>

<p>He went on a few steps before he realized that Mat
had stopped. He stopped, too, wriggling his toes in his boots. At
least his feet felt warm. He eased the straps across his shoulders.
His blanket roll and Thom&rsquo;s bundled cloak were not heavy, but even
a few pounds weighed heavy after miles on an empty stomach. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the matter, Mat?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you so anxious to sell it?&rdquo; Mat demanded
angrily. &ldquo;I found it, after all. You ever think I might like to
keep it? For a while, anyway. If you want to sell something, sell
that bloody sword!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand rubbed his hand along the heron-marked hilt. &ldquo;My
father gave this sword to me. It was his. I wouldn&rsquo;t ask you to
sell something your father gave you. Blood and ashes, Mat, do you
like going hungry? Anyway, even if I could find somebody to buy it,
how much would a sword bring? What would a farmer want with a
sword? That ruby would fetch enough to take us all the way to
Caemlyn in a carriage. Maybe all the way to Tar Valon. And we&rsquo;d eat
every meal in an inn, and sleep every night in a bed. Maybe you
like the idea of walking halfway across the world and sleeping on
the ground?&rdquo; He glared at Mat, and his friend glared back.</p>

<p>They stood like that in the middle of the road until
Mat suddenly gave an uncomfortable shrug, and dropped his eyes to
the road. &ldquo;Who would I sell it to, Rand? A farmer would have to pay
in chickens; we couldn&rsquo;t buy a carriage with chickens. And if I
even showed it in any village we&rsquo;ve been through, they&rsquo;d probably
think we stole it. The Light knows what would happen then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a minute Rand nodded reluctantly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
right. I know it. I&rsquo;m sorry; I didn&rsquo;t mean to snap at you. It&rsquo;s
only that I&rsquo;m hungry and my feet hurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mine, too.&rdquo; They started down the road again,
walking even more wearily than before. The wind gusted up, blowing
dust in their faces. &ldquo;Mine, too.&rdquo; Mat coughed.</p>

<p>Farms did provide some meals and a few nights out of
the cold. A haystack was nearly as warm as a room with a fire, at
least compared to lying under the bushes, and a haystack, even one
without a tarp over it, kept all but the heaviest rain off, if you
dug yourself in deeply enough. Sometimes Mat tried his hand at
stealing eggs, and once he attempted to milk a cow left unattended,
staked out on a long rope to crop in a field. Most farms had dogs,
though, and farm dogs were watchful. A two-mile run with baying
hounds at their heels was too high a price for two or three eggs as
Rand saw it, especially when the dogs sometimes took hours to go
away and let them down out of the tree where they had taken
shelter. The hours were what he regretted.</p>

<p>He did not really like doing it, but Rand preferred
to approach a farmhouse openly in broad daylight. Now and again
they had the dogs set on them anyway, without a word being said,
for the rumors and the times made everyone who lived apart from
other people nervous about strangers, but often an hour or so
chopping wood or hauling water would earn a meal and a bed, even if
the bed was a pile of straw in the barn. But an hour or two doing
chores was an hour or two of daylight when they were standing
still, an hour or two for the Myrddraal to catch up. Sometimes he
wondered how many miles a Fade could cover in an hour. He begrudged
every minute of it&mdash;though admittedly not so much when he was
wolfing down a goodwife&rsquo;s hot soup. And when they had no food,
knowing they had spent every possible minute moving toward Caemlyn
did not do much to soothe an empty belly. Rand could not make up
his mind if it was worse to lose time or go hungry, but Mat went
beyond worrying about his belly or pursuit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do we know about them, anyway?&rdquo; Mat demanded
one afternoon while they were mucking out stalls on a small
farm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light, Mat, what do they know about us?&rdquo; Rand
sneezed. They were working stripped to the waist, and sweat and
straw covered them both liberally, and motes of straw-dust hung in
the air. &ldquo;What I know is they&rsquo;ll give us some roast lamb and a real
bed to sleep in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat dug his hayfork into the straw and manure and
gave a sidelong frown at the farmer, coming from the back of the
barn with a bucket in one hand and his milking stool in the other.
A stooped old man with skin like leather and thin, gray hair, the
farmer slowed when he saw Mat looking at him, then looked away
quickly and hurried on out of the barn, slopping milk over the rim
of the bucket in his haste.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s up to something, I tell you,&rdquo; Mat said. &ldquo;See
the way he wouldn&rsquo;t meet my eye? Why are they so friendly to a
couple of wanderers they never laid eyes on before? Tell me
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His wife says we remind her of their grandsons. Will
you stop worrying about them? What we have to worry about is behind
us. I hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s up to something,&rdquo; Mat muttered.</p>

<p>When they finished, they washed up at the trough in
front of the barn, their shadows stretching long with the sinking
sun. Rand toweled off with his shirt as they walked to the
farmhouse. The farmer met them at the door; he leaned on a
quarterstaff in a too-casual manner. Behind him his wife clutched
her apron and peered past his shoulder, chewing her lip. Rand
sighed; he did not think he and Mat reminded them of their
grandsons any longer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our sons are coming to visit tonight,&rdquo; the old man
said. &ldquo;All four of them. I forgot. They&rsquo;re all four coming. Big
lads. Strong. Be here any time, now. I&rsquo;m afraid we don&rsquo;t have the
bed we promised you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His wife thrust a small bundle wrapped in a napkin
past him. &ldquo;Here. It&rsquo;s bread, and cheese, and pickles, and lamb.
Enough for two meals, maybe. Here.&rdquo; Her wrinkled face asked them to
please take it and go.</p>

<p>Rand took the bundle. &ldquo;Thank you. I understand. Come
on, Mat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat followed him, grumbling while he pulled his shirt
over his head. Rand thought it best to cover as many miles as they
could before stopping to eat. The old farmer had a dog.</p>

<p>It could have been worse, he thought. Three days
earlier, while they were still working, they&rsquo;d had the dogs set on
them. The dogs, and the farmer, and his two sons waving cudgels
chased them out to the Caemlyn Road and half a mile down it before
giving up. They had barely had time to snatch up their belongings
and run. The farmer had carried a bow with a broad-head arrow
nocked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come back, hear!&rdquo; he had shouted after them.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re up to, but don&rsquo;t let me see your shifty
eyes again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat had started to turn back, fumbling at his quiver,
but Rand pulled him on. &ldquo;Are you crazy?&rdquo; Mat gave him a sullen
look, but at least he kept running.</p>

<p>Rand sometimes wondered if it was worthwhile stopping
at farms. The further they went, the more suspicious of strangers
Mat became, and the less he was able to hide it. Or bothered to.
The meals got skimpier for the same work, and sometimes not even
the barn was offered as a place to sleep. But then a solution to
all their problems came to Rand, or so it seemed, and it came at
Grinwell&rsquo;s farm.</p>

<p>Master Grinwell and his wife had nine children, the
eldest a daughter not more than a year younger than Rand and Mat.
Master Grinwell was a sturdy man, and with his children he probably
had no need of any more help, but he looked them up and down,
taking in their travel-stained clothes and dusty boots, and allowed
as how he could always find work for more hands. Mistress Grinwell
said that if they were going to eat at her table, they would not do
it in those filthy things. She was about to do laundry, and some of
her husband&rsquo;s old clothes would fit them well enough for working.
She smiled when she said it, and for a minute she looked to Rand
just like Mistress al&rsquo;Vere, though her hair was yellow; he had
never seen hair that color before. Even Mat seemed to lose some of
his tension when her smile touched him. The eldest daughter was
another matter.</p>

<p>Dark-haired, big-eyed, and pretty, Else grinned
impudently at them whenever her parents were not looking. While
they worked, moving barrels and sacks of grain in the barn, she
hung over a stall door, humming to herself and chewing the end of
one long pigtail, watching them. Rand she watched especially. He
tried to ignore her, but after a few minutes he put on the shirt
Master Grinwell had loaned him. It was tight across the shoulders
and too short, but it was better than nothing. Else laughed out
loud when he tugged it on. He began to think that this time it
would not be Mat&rsquo;s fault when they were chased off.</p>

<p><em>Perrin would know how to handle this</em>, he
thought. <em>He&rsquo;d make some offhand comment, and pretty soon she&rsquo;d
be laughing at his jokes instead of mooning around where her father
can see</em>. Only he could not think of any offhand comment, or
any jokes, either. Whenever he looked in her direction, she smiled
at him in a way that would have her father loosing the dogs on them
if he saw. Once she told him she liked tall men. All the boys on
the farms around there were short. Mat gave a nasty snicker.
Wishing he could think of a joke, Rand tried to concentrate on his
hayfork.</p>

<p>The younger children, at least, were a blessing in
Rand&rsquo;s eyes. Mat&rsquo;s wariness always eased a little when there were
children around. After supper they all settled in front of the
fireplace, with Master Grinwell in his favorite chair thumbing his
pipe full of tabac and Mistress Grinwell fussing with her sewing
box and the shirts she had washed for him and Mat. Mat dug out
Thom&rsquo;s colored balls and began to juggle. He never did that unless
there were children. The children laughed when he pretended to be
dropping the balls, snatching them at the last minute, and they
clapped for fountains and figure-eights and a six-ball circle that
he really did almost drop. But they took it in good part, Master
Grinwell and his wife applauding as hard as their children. When
Mat was done, bowing around the room with as many flourishes as
Thom might have made, Rand took Thom&rsquo;s flute from its case.</p>

<p>He could never handle the instrument without a pang
of sadness. Touching its gold-and-silver scrollwork was like
touching Thom&rsquo;s memory. He never handled the harp except to see
that it was safe and dry&mdash;Thom had always said the harp was
beyond a farmboy&rsquo;s clumsy hands&mdash;but whenever a farmer
allowed them to stay, he always played one tune on the flute after
supper. It was just a little something extra to pay the farmer, and
maybe a way of keeping Thom&rsquo;s memory fresh.</p>

<p>With a laughing mood already set by Mat&rsquo;s juggling,
he played &ldquo;Three Girls in the Meadow.&rdquo; Master and Mistress Grinwell
clapped along, and the smaller children danced around the floor,
even the smallest boy, who could barely walk, stomping his feet in
time. He knew he would win no prizes at Bel Tine, but after Thom&rsquo;s
teaching he would not be embarrassed to enter.</p>

<p>Else was sitting cross-legged in front of the fire,
and as he lowered the flute after the last note, she leaned forward
with a long sigh and smiled at him. &ldquo;You play so beautifully. I
never heard anything so beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mistress Grinwell suddenly paused in her sewing and
raised an eyebrow at her daughter, then gave Rand a long,
appraising look.</p>

<p>He had picked up the leather case to put the flute
away, but under her stare he dropped the case and almost the flute,
too. If she accused him of trifling with her daughter&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;In
desperation he put the flute back to his lips and played another
song, then another, and another. Mistress Grinwell kept watching
him. He played &ldquo;The Wind That Shakes the Willow,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Coming Home
From Tarwin&rsquo;s Gap,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mistress Aynora&rsquo;s Rooster,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Old
Black Bear.&rdquo; He played every song he could think of, but she never
took her eyes off him. She never said anything, either, but she
watched, and weighed.</p>

<p>It was late when Master Grinwell finally stood up,
chuckling and rubbing his hands together. &ldquo;Well, this has been rare
fun, but it&rsquo;s way past our bedtime. You traveling lads make your
own hours, but morning comes early on a farm. I&rsquo;ll tell you lads, I
have paid good money at an inn for no better entertainment than
I&rsquo;ve had this night. For worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think they should have a reward, father,&rdquo; Mistress
Grinwell said as she picked up her youngest boy, who had long since
fallen asleep in front of the fire. &ldquo;The barn is no fit place to
sleep. They can sleep in Else&rsquo;s room tonight, and she will sleep
with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Else grimaced. She was careful to keep her head down,
but Rand saw it. He thought her mother did, too.</p>

<p>Master Grinwell nodded. &ldquo;Yes, yes, much better than
the barn. If you don&rsquo;t mind sleeping two to a bed, that is.&rdquo; Rand
flushed; Mistress Grinwell was still looking at him. &ldquo;I do wish I
could hear more of that flute. And your juggling, too. I like that.
You know, there&rsquo;s a little task you could help with tomorrow, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be wanting an early start, father,&rdquo; Mistress
Grinwell cut in. &ldquo;Arien is the next village the way they&rsquo;re going,
and if they intend to try their luck at the inn there, they&rsquo;ll have
to walk all day to get there before dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mistress,&rdquo; Rand said, &ldquo;we will. And thank
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave him a tight-lipped smile as if she knew very
well that his thanks were for more than her advice, or even supper
and a warm bed.</p>

<p>The whole next day Mat twitted him about Else as they
made their way down the road. He kept trying to change the subject,
and what the Grinwells had suggested about performing at inns was
the easiest thing to mind. In the morning, with Else pouting as he
left, and Mistress Grinwell watching with a sharp-eyed look of
good-riddance and soonest-mended, it was just something to keep Mat
from talking. By the time they did reach the next village, it was
something else again.</p>

<p>With dusk descending, they entered the only inn in
Arien, and Rand spoke to the innkeeper. He played &ldquo;Ferry O&rsquo;er the
River&rdquo;&mdash;which the plump innkeeper called &ldquo;Darling Sara&rdquo;&mdash;and part of &ldquo;The Road to Dun Aren,&rdquo; and Mat did a little
juggling, and the upshot was that they slept in a bed that night
and ate roasted potatoes and hot beef. It was the smallest room in
the inn, to be sure, up under the eaves in the back, and the meal
came in the middle of a long night of playing and juggling, but it
was still a bed beneath a roof. Even better, to Rand, every
daylight hour had been spent traveling. And the inn&rsquo;s patrons did
not seem to care if Mat stared at them suspiciously. Some of them
even looked askance at one another. The times made suspicion of
strangers a commonplace, and there were always strangers at an
inn.</p>

<p>Rand slept better than he had since leaving
Whitebridge, despite sharing a bed with Mat and his nocturnal
muttering. In the morning the innkeeper tried to talk them into
staying another day or two, but when he could not, he called over a
bleary-eyed farmer who had drunk too much to drive his cart home
the night before. An hour later they were five miles further east,
sprawling on their backs on the straw in the back of Eazil Forney&rsquo;s
cart.</p>

<p>That became the way of their traveling. With a little
luck, and maybe a ride or two, they could almost always reach the
next village by dark. If there was more than one inn in a village,
the innkeepers would bid for them once they heard Rand&rsquo;s flute and
saw Mat juggle. Together they still did not come close to a
gleeman, but they were more than most villages saw in a year. Two
or three inns in a town meant a better room, with two beds, and
more generous portions of a better cut of meat, and sometimes even
a few coppers in their pockets when they left besides. In the
mornings there was almost always someone to offer a ride, another
farmer who had stayed too late and drunk too much, or a merchant
who had liked their entertainment enough not to mind if they hopped
up on the back of one of his wagons. Rand began to think their
problems were over till they reached Caemlyn. But then they came to
Four Kings.</p>
