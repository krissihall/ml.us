<h4><em>The Peddler</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">C</span>lusters
of pots clattered and banged as the peddler&rsquo;s wagon
rumbled over the heavy timbers of the Wagon Bridge. Still
surrounded by a cloud of villagers and farmers come for Festival,
the peddler reined his horses to a stop in front of the inn. From
every direction people streamed to swell the numbers around the
great wagon, its wheels taller than any of the people with their
eyes fastened to the peddler above them on the wagon seat.</p>

<p>The man on the wagon was Padan Fain, a pale, skinny fellow with
gangly arms and a massive beak of a nose. Fain, always smiling and
laughing as if he knew a joke that no one else knew, had driven his
wagon and team into Emond&rsquo;s Field every spring for as long as Rand
could remember.</p>

<p>The door of the inn flew open even as the team halted in a
jangle of harness, and the Village Council appeared, led by Master
al&rsquo;Vere and Tam. They marched out deliberately, even Cenn Buie,
amid all the excited shouting of the others for pins or lace or
books or a dozen other things. Reluctantly the crowd parted to let them
to the fore, everyone
closing in quickly behind and never stopping their calling to the
peddler. Most of all, the villagers called for news.</p>

<p>In the eyes of the villagers, needles and tea and the like were
no more than half the freight in a peddler&rsquo;s wagon. Every bit as
important was word of outside, news of the world beyond the Two
Rivers. Some peddlers simply told what they knew, throwing it out
in a heap, a pile of rubbish with which they could not be bothered.
Others had to have every word dragged out of them, speaking
grudgingly, with a bad grace. Fain, however, spoke freely if often
teasingly, and spun out the telling, making a show to rival a
gleeman. He enjoyed being the center of attention, strutting around
like an under-sized rooster, with every eye on him. It occurred to
Rand that Fain might not be best pleased to find a real gleeman in
Emond&rsquo;s Field.</p>

<p>The peddler gave the Council and villagers alike exactly the
same attention as he fussed with tying his reins off just so, which
was to say hardly any attention at all. He nodded casually at no
one in particular. He smiled without speaking, and waved absently
to people with whom he was particularly friendly, though his
friendliness had always been of a peculiarly distant kind,
backslapping without ever getting close.</p>

<p>The demands for him to speak grew louder, but Fain waited,
fiddling with small tasks about the driver&rsquo;s seat, for the crowd
and the anticipation to reach the size he wanted. The Council alone
kept silent. They maintained the dignity befitting their position,
but increasing clouds of pipesmoke rising above their heads showed
the effort of it.</p>

<p>Rand and Mat edged into the crowd, getting as close to the wagon
as they could. Rand would have stopped halfway, but Mat wriggled
through the press, pulling Rand behind him, until they were right
behind the Council.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had been thinking you were going to stay out on the farm
through the whole Festival,&rdquo; Perrin Aybara shouted at Rand over the
clamor. Half a head shorter than Rand, the curly-haired
blacksmith&rsquo;s apprentice was so stocky as to seem a man and a half
wide, with arms and shoulders thick enough to rival those of Master
Luhhan himself. He could easily have pushed through the throng, but
that was not his way. He picked his path carefully, offering
apologies to people who had only half a mind to notice anything but
the peddler. He made the apologies anyway, and tried not to jostle
anyone as he worked through the crowd to Rand and Mat. &ldquo;Imagine
it,&rdquo; he said when he finally reached them. &ldquo;Bel Tine and a peddler,
both together. I&rsquo;ll bet there really are fireworks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know a quarter of it.&rdquo; Mat laughed.</p>

<p>Perrin eyed him suspiciously, then looked a question at
Rand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Rand shouted, then gestured at the growing mass of
people, all giving voice. &ldquo;Later. I&rsquo;ll explain later. Later, I
said!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment Padan Fain stood up on the wagon seat, and the
crowd quieted in an instant. Rand&rsquo;s last words exploded into utter
silence, catching the peddler with an arm raised dramatically and
his mouth open. Everybody turned to stare at Rand. The bony little
man on the wagon, prepared to have everyone hanging on his first
words, gave Rand a sharp, searching look. Rand&rsquo;s face reddened, and
he wished he were Ewin&rsquo;s size so he did not stand out so clearly.
His friends shifted uncomfortably, too. It had only been the year
before that Fain had taken notice of them for the first time,
acknowledging them as men. Fain did not usually have time for
anyone too young to buy a good deal of things off his wagon. Rand
hoped he had not been relegated to a child again in the peddler&rsquo;s
eyes.</p>

<p>With a loud harrumph, Fain tugged at his heavy cloak. &ldquo;No, not
later,&rdquo; the peddler declaimed, once more throwing up a hand
grandly. &ldquo;I will be telling you now.&rdquo; As he spoke he made broad
gestures, casting his words over the crowd. &ldquo;You are thinking you
have had troubles in the Two Rivers, are you? Well, all the world
has troubles, from the Great Blight south to the Sea of Storms,
from the Aryth Ocean in the west to the Aiel Waste in the east. And
even beyond. The winter was harsher than you&rsquo;ve ever seen before,
cold enough to jell your blood and crack your bones? Ahhh! Winter
was cold and harsh everywhere. In the Borderlands they&rsquo;d be calling
your winter spring. But spring does not come, you say? Wolves have
killed your sheep? Perhaps wolves have attacked men? Is that the
way of it? Well, now. Spring is late everywhere. There are wolves
everywhere, all hungry for any flesh they can sink a tooth into, be
it sheep or cow or man. But there are things worse than wolves or
winter. There are those who would be glad to have only your little
troubles.&rdquo; He paused expectantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What could be worse than wolves killing sheep, and men?&rdquo; Cenn
Buie demanded. Others muttered in support.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men killing men.&rdquo; The peddler&rsquo;s reply, in portentous tones,
brought shocked murmurs that increased as he went on. &ldquo;It is war I
mean. There is war in Ghealdan, war and madness. The snows of the
Dhallin Forest are red with the blood of men. Ravens and the cries
of ravens fill the air. Armies march to Ghealdan. Nations, great
houses and great men, send their soldiers to fight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;War?&rdquo; Master al&rsquo;Vere&rsquo;s mouth fit awkwardly around the
unfamiliar word. No one in the Two Rivers had ever had anything to
do with a war. &ldquo;Why are they having a war?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fain grinned, and Rand had the feeling he was mocking the
villagers&rsquo; isolation from the world, and their ignorance. The
peddler leaned forward as if he were about to impart a secret to
the Mayor, but his whisper was meant to carry and did. &ldquo;The
standard of the Dragon has been raised, and men flock to oppose.
And to support.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One long gasp left every throat together, and Rand shivered in
spite of himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Dragon!&rdquo; someone moaned. &ldquo;The Dark One&rsquo;s loose in
Ghealdan!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not the Dark One,&rdquo; Haral Luhhan growled. &ldquo;The Dragon&rsquo;s not the
Dark One. And this is a false Dragon, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear what Master Fain has to say,&rdquo; the Mayor said, but no
one would be quieted that easily. People cried out from every side,
men and women shouting over one another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just as bad as the Dark One!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Dragon broke the world, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He started it! He caused the Time of Madness!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know the prophecies! When the Dragon is reborn, your worst
nightmares will seem like your fondest dreams!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just another false Dragon. He must be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What difference does that make? You remember the last false
Dragon. He started a war, too. Thousands died, isn&rsquo;t that right,
Fain? He laid siege to Illian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s evil times! No one claiming to be the Dragon Reborn for
twenty years, and now three in the last five years. Evil times!
Look at the weather!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand exchanged looks with Mat and Perrin. Mat&rsquo;s eyes shone with
excitement, but Perrin wore a worried frown. Rand could remember
every tale he had heard about the men who named themselves the
Dragon Reborn, and if they had all proven themselves false Dragons
by dying or disappearing without fulfilling any of the prophecies,
what they had done was bad enough. Whole nations torn by battle,
and cities and towns put to the torch. The dead fell like autumn
leaves, and refugees clogged the roads like sheep in a pen. So the
peddlers said, and the merchants, and no one in the Two Rivers with
any sense doubted it. The world would end, so some said, when the
real Dragon was born again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop this!&rdquo; the Mayor shouted. &ldquo;Be quiet! Stop working
yourselves to a lather out of your own imaginations. Let Master
Fain tell us about this false Dragon.&rdquo; The people began to quieten,
but Cenn Buie refused to be silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Is</em> this a false Dragon?&rdquo; the thatcher asked sourly.</p>

<p>Master al&rsquo;Vere blinked as if taken by surprise, then snapped,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be an old fool, Cenn!&rdquo; But Cenn had kindled the crowd
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t be the Dragon Reborn! Light help us, he can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You old fool, Buie! You <em>want</em> bad luck, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be naming the Dark One, next! You&rsquo;re taken by the Dragon, Cenn
Buie! Trying to bring us all harm!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cenn looked around defiantly, trying to stare down the glowers,
and raised his voice. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear Fain say this was a false
Dragon. Did you? Use your eyes! Where are the crops that should be
knee high or better? Why is it still winter when spring should be
here a month?&rdquo; There were angry shouts for Cenn to hold his tongue.
&ldquo;I will not be silent! I&rsquo;ve no liking for this talk, either, but I
won&rsquo;t hide my head under a basket till a Taren Ferry man comes to
cut my throat. And I won&rsquo;t dangle on Fain&rsquo;s pleasure, not this
time. Speak it out plain, peddler. What have you heard? Eh? Is this
man a false Dragon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>If Fain was perturbed by the news he brought or the upset he had
caused, he gave no sign of it. He merely shrugged and laid a skinny
finger alongside his nose. &ldquo;As to that, now, who can say until it
is over and done?&rdquo; He paused with one of his secretive grins,
running his eyes over the crowd as if imagining how they would
react and finding it funny. &ldquo;I do know,&rdquo; he said, too casually,
&ldquo;that he can wield the One Power. The others couldn&rsquo;t. But he can
channel. The ground opens beneath his enemies&rsquo; feet, and strong
walls crumble at his shout. Lightning comes when he calls and
strikes where he points. That I&rsquo;ve heard, and from men I
believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A stunned silence fell. Rand looked at his friends. Perrin
seemed to be seeing things he did not like, but Mat <em>still</em> looked
excited.</p>

<p>Tam, his face only a little less composed than usual, drew the
Mayor close, but before he could speak Ewin Finngar burst out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll go mad and die! In the stories, men who channel the Power
always go mad, and then waste away and die. Only women can touch
it. Doesn&rsquo;t he know that?&rdquo; He ducked under a cuff from Master
Buie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough of that from you, boy.&rdquo; Cenn shook a gnarled fist in
Ewin&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Show a proper respect and leave this to your elders.
Get away with you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold steady, Cenn,&rdquo; Tam growled. &ldquo;The boy is just curious.
There&rsquo;s no need of this foolishness from you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Act your age,&rdquo; Bran added. &ldquo;And for once remember you&rsquo;re a
member of the Council.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cenn&rsquo;s wrinkled face grew darker with every word from Tam and
the Mayor, until it was almost purple. &ldquo;You know what kind of women
he&rsquo;s talking about. Stop frowning at me, Luhhan, and you, too,
Crawe. This is a decent village of decent folk, and it&rsquo;s bad enough
to have Fain here talking about false Dragons using the Power
without this Dragon-possessed fool of a boy bringing Aes Sedai into
it. Some things just shouldn&rsquo;t be talked about, and I don&rsquo;t care if
you will be letting that fool gleeman tell any kind of tale he
wants. It isn&rsquo;t right or decent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never saw or heard or smelled anything that couldn&rsquo;t be
talked about,&rdquo; Tam said, but Fain was not finished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Aes Sedai are already into it,&rdquo; the peddler spoke up. &ldquo;A
party of them has ridden south from Tar Valon. Since he can wield
the Power, none but Aes Sedai can defeat him, for all the battles
they fight, or deal with him once he&rsquo;s defeated. If he is
defeated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Someone in the crowd moaned aloud, and even Tam and Bran
exchanged uneasy frowns. Huddles of villagers clumped together, and
some pulled their cloaks tighter around themselves, though the wind
had actually lessened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, he&rsquo;ll be defeated,&rdquo; someone shouted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re always beaten in the end, false Dragons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has to be defeated, doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What if he isn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tam had finally managed to speak quietly into the Mayor&rsquo;s ear,
and Bran, nodding from time to time and ignoring the hubbub around
them, waited until he was finished before raising his own
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All of you listen. Be quiet and listen!&rdquo; The shouting died to a
murmur again. &ldquo;This goes beyond mere news from outside. It must be
discussed by the Village Council. Master Fain, if you will join us
inside the inn, we have questions to ask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good mug of hot mulled wine would not go far amiss with me
just now,&rdquo; the peddler replied with a chuckle. He jumped down from
the wagon, dusted his hands on his coat, and cheerfully righted his
cloak. &ldquo;Will you be looking after my horses, if you please?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to hear what he has to say!&rdquo; More than one voice was
raised in protest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t take him off! My wife sent me to buy pins!&rdquo; That was
Wit Congar; he hunched his shoulders at the stares some of the
others gave him, but he held his ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve a right to ask questions, too,&rdquo; somebody back in the
crowd shouted. &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be silent!&rdquo; the Mayor roared, producing a startled hush. &ldquo;When
the Council has asked its questions, Master Fain will be back to
tell you all his news. And to sell you his pots and pins. Hu! Tad!
Stable Master Fain&rsquo;s horses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tam and Bran moved in on either side of the peddler, the rest of
the Council gathered behind them, and the whole cluster swept into
the Winespring Inn, firmly shutting the door in the faces of those
who tried to crowd inside after them. Pounding on the door brought
only a single shout from the Mayor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go home!&rdquo;</p>

<p>People milled around in front of the inn muttering about what
the peddler had said, and what it meant, and what questions the
Council was asking, and why they should be allowed to listen and
ask questions of their own. Some peered in through the front
windows of the inn, and a few even questioned Hu and Tad, though it
was far from clear what they were supposed to know. The two stolid
stablemen just grunted in reply and went on methodically removing
the team&rsquo;s harness. One by one they led Fain&rsquo;s horses away and,
when the last was gone, did not return.</p>

<p>Rand ignored the crowd. He took a seat on the edge of the old
stone foundation, gathered his cloak around him, and stared at the
inn door. Ghealdan. Tar Valon. The very names were strange and
exciting. They were places he knew only from peddlers&rsquo; news, and
tales told by merchants&rsquo; guards. Aes Sedai and wars and false
Dragons: those were the stuff of stories told late at night in
front of the fireplace, with one candle making strange shapes on
the wall and the wind howling against the shutters. On the whole,
he believed he would rather have blizzards and wolves. Still, it
must be different out there, beyond the Two Rivers, like living in
the middle of a gleeman&rsquo;s tale. An adventure. One long adventure. A
whole lifetime of it.</p>

<p>Slowly the villagers dispersed, still muttering and shaking
their heads. Wit Congar paused to stare into the now-abandoned
wagon as though he might find another peddler hidden inside.
Finally only a few of the younger folk were left. Mat and Perrin
drifted over to where Rand sat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how the gleeman could beat this,&rdquo; Mat said
excitedly. &ldquo;I wonder if we might get to see this false Dragon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin shook his shaggy head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to see him.
Somewhere else, maybe, but not in the Two Rivers. Not if it means
war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not if it means Aes Sedai here, either,&rdquo; Rand added. &ldquo;Or have
you forgotten who caused the Breaking? The Dragon may have started
it, but it was Aes Sedai who actually broke the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard a story once,&rdquo; Mat said slowly, &ldquo;from a wool-buyer&rsquo;s
guard. He said the Dragon would be reborn in mankind&rsquo;s greatest
hour of need, and save us all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he was a fool if he believed that,&rdquo; Perrin said firmly.
&ldquo;And you were a fool to listen.&rdquo; He did not sound angry; he was
slow to anger. But he sometimes got exasperated with Mat&rsquo;s
quicksilver fancies, and there was a touch of that in his voice. &ldquo;I
suppose he claimed we&rsquo;d all live in a new Age of Legends
afterwards, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say I believed it,&rdquo; Mat protested. &ldquo;I just heard it.
Nynaeve did, too, and I thought she was going to skin me and the
guard both. He said&mdash;the guard did&mdash;that a lot of
people do believe, only they&rsquo;re afraid to say so, afraid of the Aes
Sedai or the Children of the Light. He wouldn&rsquo;t say any more after
Nynaeve lit into us. She told the merchant, and he said it was the
guard&rsquo;s last trip with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good thing, too,&rdquo; Perrin said. &ldquo;The Dragon going to save us?
Sounds like Coplin talk to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of need would be great enough that we&rsquo;d want the
Dragon to save us from it?&rdquo; Rand mused. &ldquo;As well ask for help from
the Dark One.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; Mat replied uncomfortably. &ldquo;And he didn&rsquo;t
mention any new Age of Legends. He said the world would be torn
apart by the Dragon&rsquo;s coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would surely save us,&rdquo; Perrin said dryly. &ldquo;Another
Breaking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn me!&rdquo; Mat growled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only telling you what the guard
said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin shook his head. &ldquo;I just hope the Aes Sedai and this
Dragon, false or not, stay where they are. Maybe that way the Two
Rivers will be spared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think they&rsquo;re really Darkfriends?&rdquo; Mat was frowning
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Rand asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand glanced at Perrin, who shrugged. &ldquo;The stories,&rdquo; he began
slowly, but Mat cut him off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not all the stories say they serve the Dark One, Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light, Mat,&rdquo; Rand said, &ldquo;they caused the Breaking. What more do
you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose.&rdquo; Mat sighed, but the next moment he was grinning
again. &ldquo;Old Bili Congar says they don&rsquo;t exist. Aes Sedai.
Darkfriends. Says they&rsquo;re just stories. He says he doesn&rsquo;t believe
in the Dark One, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin snorted. &ldquo;Coplin talk from a Congar. What else can you
expect?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old Bili named the Dark One. I&rsquo;ll bet you didn&rsquo;t know
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light!&rdquo; Rand breathed.</p>

<p>Mat&rsquo;s grin broadened. &ldquo;It was last spring, just before the
cutworm got into his fields and nobody else&rsquo;s. Right before
everybody in his house came down with yellow eye fever. I heard him
do it. He still says he doesn&rsquo;t believe, but whenever I ask him to
name the Dark One now, he throws something at me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are just stupid enough to do that, aren&rsquo;t you, Matrim
Cauthon?&rdquo; Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara stepped into their huddle, the dark
braid pulled over her shoulder almost bristling with anger. Rand
scrambled to his feet. Slender and barely taller than Mat&rsquo;s
shoulder, at the moment the Wisdom seemed taller than any of them,
and it did not matter that she was young and pretty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suspected something of the sort about Bili Congar at the
time, but I thought you at least had more sense than to try
taunting him into such a thing. You may be old enough to be
married, Matrim Cauthon, but in truth you shouldn&rsquo;t be off your
mother&rsquo;s apron strings. The next thing, you&rsquo;ll be naming the Dark
One yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Wisdom,&rdquo; Mat protested, looking as if he would rather be
any where else than there. &ldquo;It was old Bil&mdash;I mean, Master
Congar, not me! Blood and ashes, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch your tongue, Matrim!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stood up straighter, though her glare was not directed at
him. Perrin looked equally abashed. Later one or another of them
would almost certainly complain about being scolded by a woman not
all that much older than themselves&mdash;someone always did after
one of Nynaeve&rsquo;s scoldings, if never in her hearing&mdash;but the
gap in ages always seemed more than wide enough when face to face
with her. Especially if she was angry. The stick in her hand was
thick at one end and a slender switch at the other, and she was
liable to give a flail to anybody she thought was acting the fool&mdash;head or hands or legs&mdash;no matter their age or
position.</p>

<p>The Wisdom so held his attention that at first Rand failed to
see she was not alone. When he realized his mistake, he began to
think about leaving no matter what Nynaeve would say or do
later.</p>

<p>Egwene stood a few paces behind the Wisdom, watching intently.
Of a height with Nynaeve, and with the same dark coloring, she
could at that moment have been a reflection of Nynaeve&rsquo;s mood, arms
crossed beneath her breasts, mouth tight with disapproval. The hood
of her soft gray cloak shaded her face, and her big brown eyes held
no laughter now.</p>

<p>If there was any fairness, he thought that being two years older
than her should give him some advantage, but that was not the way
of it. At the best of times he was never very nimble with his
tongue when talking to any of the village girls, not like Perrin,
but whenever Egwene gave him that intent look, with her eyes as
wide as they would go, as if every last ounce of her attention was
on him, he just could not seem to make the words go where he
wanted. Perhaps he could get away as soon as Nynaeve finished. But
he knew he would not, even if he did not understand why.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are done staring like a moonstruck lamb, Rand al&rsquo;Thor,&rdquo;
Nynaeve said, &ldquo;perhaps you can tell me why you were talking about
something even you three great bull calves ought to have sense
enough to keep out of your mouths.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand gave a start and pulled his eyes away from Egwene; she had
grown a disconcerting smile when the Wisdom began speaking.
Nynaeve&rsquo;s voice was tart, but she had the beginnings of a knowing
smile on her face, too until Mat laughed aloud. The Wisdom&rsquo;s smile
vanished, and the look she gave Mat cut his laughter off in a
strangled croak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Rand?&rdquo; Nynaeve said.</p>

<p>Out of the corner of his eye he saw Egwene still smiling. <em>What
does she think is so funny?</em> &ldquo;It was natural enough to talk of it,
Wisdom,&rdquo; he said hurriedly. &ldquo;The peddler&mdash;Padan Fain&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Master Fain&mdash;brought news of a false Dragon in Ghealdan, and a war,
and Aes Sedai. The Council thought it was important enough to talk
to him. What else would we be talking about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve shook her head. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why the peddler&rsquo;s wagon
stands abandoned. I heard people rushing to meet it, but I couldn&rsquo;t
leave Mistress Ayellin till her fever broke. The Council is
questioning the peddler about what&rsquo;s happening in Ghealdan, are
they? If I know them, they&rsquo;re asking all the wrong questions and
none of the right ones. It will take the Women&rsquo;s Circle to find out
anything useful.&rdquo; Settling her cloak firmly on her shoulders she
disappeared into the inn.</p>

<p>Egwene did not follow the Wisdom. As the inn door closed behind
Nynaeve, the younger woman came to stand in front of Rand. The
frowns were gone from her face, but her unblinking stare made him
uneasy. He looked to his friends, but they moved away, grinning
broadly as they abandoned him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t let Mat get you mixed up in his foolishness,
Rand,&rdquo; Egwene said, as solemn as a Wisdom herself, then abruptly
she giggled. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you look like that since Cenn Buie
caught you and Mat up in his apple trees when you were ten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shifted his feet and glanced at his friends. They stood not
far away, Mat gesturing excitedly as he talked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you dance with me tomorrow?&rdquo; That was not what he had
meant to say. He did want to dance with her, but at the same time
he wanted nothing so little as the uncomfortable way he was sure to
feel while he was with her. The way he felt right then.</p>

<p>The corners of her mouth quirked up in a small smile. &ldquo;In the
afternoon,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I will be busy in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the others came Perrin&rsquo;s exclamation. &ldquo;A gleeman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene turned toward them, but Rand put a hand on her arm.
&ldquo;Busy? How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite the chill she pushed back the hood of her cloak and with
apparent casualness pulled her hair forward over her shoulder. The
last time he had seen her, her hair had hung in dark waves below
her shoulders, with only a red ribbon keeping it back from her
face; now it was worked into a long braid.</p>

<p>He stared at that braid as if it were a viper, then stole a
glance at the Spring Pole, standing alone on the Green now, ready
for tomorrow. In the morning unmarried women of marriageable age
would dance the Pole. He swallowed hard. Somehow, it had never
occurred to him that she would reach marriageable age at the same
time that he did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just because someone is old enough to marry,&rdquo; he muttered,
&ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t mean they should. Not right away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not. Or ever, for that matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand blinked. &ldquo;Ever?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Wisdom almost never marries. Nynaeve has been teaching me,
you know. She says I have a talent, that I can learn to listen to
the wind. Nynaeve says not all Wisdoms can, even if they say they
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wisdom!&rdquo; he hooted. He failed to notice the dangerous glint in
her eye. &ldquo;Nynaeve will be Wisdom here for another fifty years at
least. Probably more. Are you going to spend the rest of your life
as her apprentice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are other villages,&rdquo; she replied heatedly. &ldquo;Nynaeve says
the villages north of the Taren always choose a Wisdom from away.
They think it stops her from having favorites among the village
folk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His amusement melted as fast as it had come. &ldquo;Outside the Two
Rivers? I&rsquo;d never see you again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you wouldn&rsquo;t like that? You have not given any sign lately
that you&rsquo;d care one way or another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one ever leaves the Two Rivers,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Maybe somebody
from Taren Ferry, but they&rsquo;re all strange anyway. Hardly like Two
Rivers folk at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene gave an exasperated sigh. &ldquo;Well, maybe I&rsquo;m strange, too.
Maybe I want to see some of the places I hear about in the stories.
Have you ever thought of that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I have. I daydream sometimes, but I know the
difference between daydreams and what&rsquo;s real.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I do not?&rdquo; she said furiously, and promptly turned her back
on him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t what I meant. I was talking about me. Egwene?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She jerked her cloak around her, a wall to shut him off, and
stiffly walked a few paces away. He rubbed his head in frustration.
How to explain? This was not the first time she had squeezed
meanings from his words that he never knew was in them. In her
present mood, a misstep would only make matters worse, and he was
fairly sure that nearly anything he said would be a misstep.</p>

<p>Mat and Perrin came back then. Egwene ignored their coming. They
looked at her hesitantly, then crowded close to Rand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moiraine gave Perrin a coin, too,&rdquo; Mat said. &ldquo;Just like ours.&rdquo;
He paused before adding, &ldquo;And he saw the rider.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; Rand demanded. &ldquo;When? Did anybody else see him? Did you
tell anyone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin raised broad hands in a slowing gesture. &ldquo;One question at
a time. I saw him on the edge of the village, watching the smithy,
just at twilight. Yesterday. Gave me the shivers, he did. I told
Master Luhhan, only nobody was there when he looked. He said I was
seeing shadows. But he carried his biggest hammer around with him
while we were banking the forge-fire and putting the tools up. He&rsquo;s
never done that before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So he believed you,&rdquo; Rand said, but Perrin shrugged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I asked him why he was carrying the hammer if all
I saw was shadows, and he said something about wolves getting bold
enough to come into the village. Maybe he thought that&rsquo;s what I
saw, but he ought to know I can tell the difference between a wolf
and a man on horseback, even at dusk. I know what I saw, and nobody
is going to make me believe different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;Remember, I saw him, too.&rdquo; Perrin
gave a satisfied grunt, as if he had not been sure of that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What <em>are</em> you talking about?&rdquo; Egwene demanded suddenly.</p>

<p>Rand suddenly wished he had spoken more quietly. He would have
if he had realized she was listening. Mat and Perrin, grinning like
fools, fell all over themselves telling her of their encounters
with the black-cloaked rider, but Rand kept silent. He was sure he
knew what she would say when they were done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve was right,&rdquo; Egwene announced to the sky when the two
youths fell silent. &ldquo;None of you is ready to be off leading
strings. People do ride horses, you know. That doesn&rsquo;t make them
monsters out of a gleeman&rsquo;s tale.&rdquo; Rand nodded to himself, it was
just as he had thought. She rounded on him. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve been
spreading these tales. Sometimes you have no sense, Rand al&rsquo;Thor.
The winter has been frightening enough without you going about
scaring the children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand gave a sour grimace. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t spread anything, Egwene.
But I saw what I saw, and it was no farmer out looking for a
strayed cow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene drew a deep breath and opened her mouth, but whatever she
had been going to say vanished as the door of the inn opened and a
man with shaggy white hair came hurrying out as if pursued.</p>
