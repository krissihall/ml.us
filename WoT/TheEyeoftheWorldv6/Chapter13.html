<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">B</span>efore they went to sleep Moiraine knelt by each in turn and
laid her hands on their heads. Lan grumbled that he had no need and
she should not waste her strength, but he did not try to stop her.
Egwene was eager for the experience; Mat and Perrin clearly
frightened of it, and frightened to say no. Thom jerked away from
the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s hands, but she seized his gray head with a look
that allowed no nonsense. The gleeman scowled through the entire
thing. She smiled mockingly once she took her hands away. His frown
deepened, but he did look refreshed. They all did.</p>

<p>Rand had drawn back into a niche in the uneven wall where he
hoped he would be overlooked. His eyes wanted to slide closed once
he leaned back against the timber jumble, but he forced himself to
watch. He pushed a fist against his mouth to stifle a yawn. A
little sleep, an hour or two, and he would be just fine. Moiraine
did not forget him, though.</p>

<p>He flinched at the coolness of her fingers on his face, and
said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; His eyes widened in wonder. Tiredness
drained out of him like water running downhill; aches and soreness
ebbed to dim memories and vanished. He stared at her with his mouth
hanging open. She only smiled and withdrew her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is done,&rdquo; she said, and as she stood with a weary sigh he
was reminded that she could not do the same for herself. Indeed,
she only drank a little tea, refusing the bread and cheese Lan tried to
press on her, before curling up beside the fire.
She seemed to fall asleep the instant she wrapped her cloak around
her.</p>

<p>The others, all save Lan, were dropping asleep wherever they
could find a space to stretch out, but Rand could not imagine why.
He felt as if he had already had a full night in a good bed. No
sooner did he lean back against the log wall, though, than sleep
rolled him under. When Lan poked him awake an hour later he felt as
though he had had three days rest.</p>

<p>The Warder awakened them all, except Moiraine, and he sternly
hushed any sound that might disturb her. Even so, he allowed them
only a short stay in the snug cave of trees. Before the sun was
twice its own height above the horizon, all traces that anyone had
ever stopped there had been cleared away and they were all mounted
and moving north toward Baerlon, riding slowly to conserve the
horses. The Aes Sedai&rsquo;s eyes were shadowed, but she sat her saddle
upright and steady.</p>

<p>Fog still hung thick over the river behind them, a gray wall
resisting the efforts of the feeble sun to burn it away and hiding
the Two Rivers from view. Rand watched over his shoulder as he
rode, hoping for one last glimpse, even of Taren Ferry, until the
fogbank was lost to sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never thought I&rsquo;d ever be this far from home,&rdquo; he said when
the trees at last hid both the fog and the river. &ldquo;Remember when
Watch Hill seemed a long way?&rdquo; <em>Two days ago, that was. It seems
like forever</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a month or two, we&rsquo;ll be back,&rdquo; Perrin said in a strained
voice. &ldquo;Think what we&rsquo;ll have to tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even Trollocs can&rsquo;t chase us forever,&rdquo; Mat said. &ldquo;Burn me, they
can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He straightened around with a heavy sigh, slumping in his
saddle as if he did not believe a word that had been said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men!&rdquo; Egwene snorted. &ldquo;You get the adventure you&rsquo;re always
prating about, and already you&rsquo;re talking about home.&rdquo; She held her
head high, yet Rand noticed a tremor to her voice, now that nothing
more was to be seen of the Two Rivers.</p>

<p>Neither Moiraine nor Lan made any attempt to reassure them, not
a word to say that of course they would come back. He tried not to
think on what that might mean. Even rested, he was full enough of
doubts without searching out more. Hunching in his saddle he began
a waking dream of tending the sheep alongside Tam in a pasture with
deep, lush grass and larks singing of a spring morning. And a trip
into Emond&rsquo;s Field, and Bel Tine the way it had been, dancing on
the Green with never a care beyond whether he might stumble in the
steps. He managed to lose himself in it for a long time.</p>

<p>The journey to Baerlon took almost a week. Lan muttered about
the laggardness of their travel, but it was he who set the pace and
forced the rest to keep it. With himself and his stallion, Mandarb&mdash;he said it meant &ldquo;Blade&rdquo; in the Old Tongue&mdash;he was not
so sparing. The Warder covered twice as much ground as they did,
galloping ahead, his color-shifting cloak swirling in the wind, to
scout what lay before them, or dropping behind to examine their
backtrail. Any others who tried to move at more than a walk,
though, got cutting words on taking care of their animals, biting
words on how well they would do afoot if the Trollocs did appear.
Not even Moiraine was proof against his tongue if she let the white
mare pick up her step. Aldieb, the mare was called; in the Old
Tongue, &ldquo;Westwind,&rdquo; the wind that brought the spring rains.</p>

<p>The Warder&rsquo;s scouting never turned up any sign of pursuit, or
ambush. He spoke only to Moiraine of what he saw, and that quietly,
so it could not be overheard, and the Aes Sedai informed the rest
of them of what she thought they needed to know. In the beginning,
Rand looked over his shoulder as much as he did ahead. He was not
the only one. Perrin fingered his axe often, and Mat rode with an
arrow nocked to his bow, in the beginning. But the land behind
remained empty of Trollocs or figures in black cloaks, the sky
remained empty of Draghkar. Slowly, Rand began to think perhaps
they really had escaped.</p>

<p>No very great cover was to be had, even in the thickest parts of
the woods. Winter clung as hard north of the Taren as it did in the
Two Rivers. Stands of pine or fir or leatherleaf, and here and
there a few spicewoods or laurels, dotted a forest of otherwise
bare, gray branches. Not even the elders showed a leaf. Only
scattered green sprigs of new growth stood out against brown
meadows beaten flat by the winter&rsquo;s snows. Here, too, much of what
did grow was stinging nettles and coarse thistle and stinkweed. On
the bare dirt of the forest floor some of the last snow still hung
on, in shady patches and in drifts beneath the low branches of
evergreens. Everyone kept their cloaks drawn well about them, for
the thin sunlight had no warmth to it and the night cold pierced
deep. No more birds flew here than in the Two Rivers, not even
ravens.</p>

<p>There was nothing leisurely about the slowness of their
movement. The North Road&mdash;Rand continued to think of it that way,
though he suspected it might have a different name here, north of
the Taren&mdash;still ran almost due north, but at Lan&rsquo;s insistence their
path snaked this way and that through the forest as often as it ran
along the hard-packed dirt road. A village, or a farm, of any sign
of men or civilization sent them circling for miles to avoid it,
though there were few enough of any of those. The whole first day
Rand saw no evidence aside from the road that men had ever been in
the woods. It came to him that even when he had gone to the foot
of the Mountains of Mist he might not have been as far from a human
habitation as he was that day.</p>

<p>The first farm he saw&mdash;a large frame house and tan barn
with high-peaked, thatched roofs, a curl of smoke rising from a
stone chimney&mdash;was a shock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no different from back home,&rdquo; Perrin said, frowning at the
distant buildings, barely visible through the trees. People moved
around the farmyard, as yet unaware of the travelers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it is,&rdquo; Mat said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just not close enough to
see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you, it&rsquo;s no different,&rdquo; Perrin insisted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be. We&rsquo;re north of the Taren, after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quiet, you two,&rdquo; Lan growled. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to be seen,
remember? This way.&rdquo; He turned west, to circle the farm through the
trees.</p>

<p>Looking back, Rand thought Perrin was right. The farm looked
much the same as any around Emond&rsquo;s Field. There was a small boy
toting water from the well, and older boys tending sheep behind a
rail fence. It even had a curing shed, for tabac. But Mat was
right, too. <em>We&rsquo;re north of the Taren. It must be different</em>.</p>

<p>Always they halted while light still clung to the sky, to choose
a spot sloped for drainage and sheltered from the wind that seldom
died completely, only changed direction. Their fire was always
small and hidden from only a few yards off, and once tea was
brewed, the flames were doused and the coals buried.</p>

<p>At their first stop, before the sun sank, Lan began teaching the
boys what to do with the weapons they carried. He started with the
bow. After watching Mat put three arrows into a knot the size of a
man&rsquo;s head on the fissured trunk of a dead leatherleaf at a
hundred paces, he told the others to take their turns. Perrin
duplicated Mat&rsquo;s feat, and Rand, summoning the flame and the void,
the empty calm that let the bow become a part of him, or him of it,
clustered his three where the points almost touched one another.
Mat gave him a congratulatory clap on the shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now if you all had bows,&rdquo; the Warder said dryly when they
started grinning, &ldquo;and if the Trollocs agreed not to come so close
you couldn&rsquo;t use them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; The grins faded abruptly. &ldquo;Let me see
what I can teach you in case they do come that close.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He showed Perrin a bit of how to use that great-bladed axe;
raising an axe to someone, or something, that had a weapon was not
at all like chopping wood or flailing around in pretend. Setting
the big apprentice blacksmith to a series of exercises, block,
parry, and strike, he did the same for Rand and his sword. Not the
wild leaping about and slashing that Rand had in mind whenever he
thought about using it, but smooth motions, one flowing into
another, almost a dance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moving the blade is not enough,&rdquo; Lan said, &ldquo;though some think
it is. The mind is part of it, most of it. Blank your mind,
sheepherder. Empty it of hate or fear, of everything. Burn them
away. You others listen to this, too. You can use it with the axe
or the bow, with a spear, or a quarterstaff, or even your bare
hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stared at him. &ldquo;The flame and the void,&rdquo; he said
wonderingly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you mean, isn&rsquo;t it? My father taught me
about that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Warder gave him an unreadable look in return. &ldquo;Hold the
sword as I showed you, sheepherder. I cannot make a mud-footed
villager into a blademaster in an hour, but perhaps I can keep you
from slicing off your own foot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand sighed and held the sword upright before him in both hands.
Moiraine watched without expression, but the next evening she told
Lan to continue the lessons.</p>

<p>The meal at evening was always the same as at midday and
breakfast, flatbread and cheese and dried meat, except that
evenings they had hot tea to wash it down instead of water. Thom
entertained them, evenings. Lan would not let the gleeman play harp
or flute&mdash;no need to rouse the countryside, the Warder said&mdash;but Thom juggled and told stories. &ldquo;Mara and the Three
Foolish Kings,&rdquo; or one of the hundreds about Anla the Wise
Counselor, or something filled with glory and adventure, like <em>The
Great Hunt of the Horn</em>, but always with a happy ending and a joyous
homecoming.</p>

<p>Yet if the land was peaceful around them, if no Trollocs
appeared among the trees, no Draghkar among the clouds, it seemed
to Rand that they managed to raise their tension themselves,
whenever it was in danger of vanishing.</p>

<p>There was the morning that Egwene awoke and began unbraiding her
hair. Rand watched her from the corner of his eye as he made up his
blanketroll. Every night when the fire was doused, everyone took to
their blankets except for Egwene and the Aes Sedai. The two women
always went aside from the others and talked for an hour or two,
returning when the others were asleep. Egwene combed her hair
out&mdash;one hundred strokes; he counted&mdash;while he was saddling Cloud,
tying his saddlebags and blanket behind the saddle. Then she tucked
the comb away, swept her loose hair over her shoulder, and pulled
up the hood of her cloak.</p>

<p>Startled, he asked, &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; She gave him a
sidelong look without answering. It was the first time he had
spoken to her in two days, he realized, since the night in the log
shelter on the bank of the Taren, but he did not let that stop him.
&ldquo;All your life you&rsquo;ve waited to wear your hair in a braid, and now
you&rsquo;re giving it up? Why? Because she doesn&rsquo;t braid hers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aes Sedai don&rsquo;t braid their hair,&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;At
least, not unless they want to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t an Aes Sedai. You&rsquo;re Egwene al&rsquo;Vere from Emond&rsquo;s
Field, and the Women&rsquo;s Circle would have a fit if they could see
you now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Women&rsquo;s Circle business is none of yours, Rand al&rsquo;Thor. And I
<em>will</em> be an Aes Sedai. Just as soon as I reach Tar Valon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He snorted. &ldquo;As soon as you reach Tar Valon. Why? Light, tell
me that. You&rsquo;re no Darkfriend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think Moiraine Sedai is a Darkfriend? Do you?&rdquo; She
squared around to face him with her fists clenched, and he almost
thought she was going to hit him. &ldquo;After she saved the village?
After she saved your father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what she is, but whatever she is, it doesn&rsquo;t say
anything about the rest of them. The stories&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grow up, Rand! Forget the stories and use your eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My eyes saw her sink the ferry! Deny that! Once you get an idea
in your head, you won&rsquo;t budge even if somebody points out you&rsquo;re
trying to stand on water. If you weren&rsquo;t such a Light blinded fool,
you&rsquo;d see&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fool, am I? Let me tell you a thing or two, Rand al&rsquo;Thor! You
are the muliest, most wool-headed&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You two trying to wake everybody inside ten miles?&rdquo; the Warder
asked.</p>

<p>Standing there with his mouth open, trying to get a word in
edgewise, Rand suddenly realized he had been shouting. They both
had.</p>

<p>Egwene&rsquo;s face went scarlet to her eyebrows, and she spun away
with a muttered, &ldquo;Men!&rdquo; that seemed as much for the Warder as for
him.</p>

<p>Warily, Rand looked around the camp. Everybody was looking at
him, not just the Warder. Mat and Perrin, with their faces white.
Thom, tensed as if ready to run or fight. Moiraine. The Aes Sedai&rsquo;s
face was expressionless, but her eyes seemed to bore into his head.
Desperately, he tried to recall exactly what he had said, about Aes
Sedai and Darkfriends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is time to be going,&rdquo; Moiraine said. She turned to Aldieb,
and Rand shivered as if he had been let out of a trap. He wondered
if he had been.</p>

<p>Two nights later, with the fire burning low, Mat licked the last
crumbs of cheese from his fingers and said, &ldquo;You know, I think
we&rsquo;ve lost them for good.&rdquo; Lan was off in the night, taking a last
look around, Moiraine and Egwene had gone aside for one of their
conversations. Thom was half dozing over his pipe, and the young
men had the fire to themselves.</p>

<p>Perrin, idly poking the embers with a stick, answered. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;ve
lost them, why does Lan keep scouting?&rdquo; Nearly asleep, Rand rolled
over, his back to the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We lost them back at Taren Ferry.&rdquo; Mat lay back with his
fingers laced behind his head, staring at the moon-filled sky. &ldquo;If
they were even really after us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think that Draghkar was chasing us because it liked us?&rdquo;
Perrin asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, stop worrying about Trollocs and such,&rdquo; Mat went on as
if Perrin had not spoken, &ldquo;and start thinking about seeing the
world. We&rsquo;re out where the stories come from. What do you think a
real city is like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to Baerlon,&rdquo; Rand said sleepily, but Mat
snorted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Baerlon&rsquo;s all very well, but I&rsquo;ve seen that old map Master
al&rsquo;Vere has. If we turn south once we reach Caemlyn, the road leads
all the way to Illian, and beyond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so special about Illian?&rdquo; Perrin said, yawning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For one
thing,&rdquo; Mat replied, &ldquo;Illian isn&rsquo;t full of Aes Se&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A silence
fell, and Rand was suddenly wide awake. Moiraine had come back
early. Egwene was with her, but it was the Aes Sedai, standing at
the edge of the firelight, who held their attention. Mat lay there
on his back, his mouth still open, staring at her. Moiraine&rsquo;s eyes
caught the light like dark, polished stones. Abruptly Rand wondered
how long she had been standing there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lads were just&mdash;&rdquo; Thom began, but Moiraine spoke
right over the top of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A few days respite, and you are ready to give up.&rdquo; Her calm,
level voice contrasted sharply with her eyes. &ldquo;A day or two of
quiet, and already you have forgotten Winternight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t forgotten,&rdquo; Perrin said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just&mdash;&rdquo; Still
not raising her voice, the Aes Sedai treated him as she had the
gleeman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that the way you all feel? You are all eager to run off to
Illian and forget about Trollocs, and Halfmen, and Draghkar?&rdquo; She
ran her eyes over them&mdash;that stony glint playing against the
everyday tone of voice made Rand uneasy&mdash;but she gave no one
a chance to speak. &ldquo;The Dark One is after you three, one or all,
and if I let you go running off wherever you want to so, he will
take you. Whatever the Dark One wants, I oppose, so hear this and
know it true. Before I let the Dark One have you, I will destroy
you myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was her voice, so matter-of-fact, that convinced Rand. The
Aes Sedai would do exactly what she said, if she thought it was
necessary. He had a hard time sleeping that night, and he was not
the only one. Even the gleeman did not begin snoring till long
after the last coals died. For once, Moiraine offered no help.</p>

<p>Those nightly talks between Egwene and the Aes Sedai were a sore
point for Rand. Whenever they disappeared into the darkness, aside
from the rest for privacy, he wondered what they were saying, what
they were doing. What was the Aes Sedai doing to Egwene?</p>

<p>One night, he waited until the other men had all settled down,
Thom snoring like a saw cutting an oak knot. Then he slipped away,
clutching his blanket around him. Using every bit of skill he had
gained stalking rabbits, he moved with the moon shadows until he
was crouched at the base of a tall leatherleaf tree, thick with
tough, broad leaves, close enough to hear Moiraine and Egwene,
where they sat on a fallen log with a small lantern for light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask,&rdquo; Moiraine was saying, &ldquo;and if I can tell you now I will.
Understand, there is much for which you are not yet ready, things
you cannot learn until you have learned other things which require
still others to be learned before them. But ask what you will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Five Powers,&rdquo; Egwene said slowly. &ldquo;Earth, Wind, Fire,
Water, and Spirit. It doesn&rsquo;t seem fair that men should have been
strongest in wielding Earth and Fire. Why should they have had the
strongest Powers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine laughed. &ldquo;Is that what you think, child? Is there a
rock so hard that wind and water cannot wear it away, a fire so
strong that water cannot quench it or wind snuff it out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene was silent for a time, digging her toe into the forest
floor. &ldquo;They&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;they were the ones who&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;who tried to free
the Dark One and the Forsaken, weren&rsquo;t they? The male Aes Sedai?&rdquo;
She took a deep breath and picked up speed. &ldquo;The women were not
part of it. It was the men who went mad and broke the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are afraid,&rdquo; Moiraine said grimly. &ldquo;If you had remained in
Emond&rsquo;s Field, you would have become Wisdom, in time. That was
Nynaeve&rsquo;s plan, was it not? Or, you would have sat in the Women&rsquo;s
Circle and managed the affairs of Emond&rsquo;s Field while the Village
Council thought it was doing so. But you did the unthinkable. You
left Emond&rsquo;s Field, left the Two Rivers, seeking adventure. You
wanted to do it, and at the same time you are afraid of it. And you
are stubbornly refusing to let your fear best you. You would not
have asked me how a woman becomes an Aes Sedai, otherwise. You
would not have thrown custom and convention over the fence,
otherwise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Egwene protested. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid. I do want to become an
Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better for you if you were afraid, but I hope you hold to that
conviction. Few women these days have the ability to become
initiates, much less have the wish to.&rdquo; Moiraine&rsquo;s voice sounded as
if she had begun musing to herself. &ldquo;Surely never before two in one
village. The old blood is indeed still strong in the Two Rivers.
&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the shadows, Rand shifted. A twig snapped under his foot. He
froze instantly, sweating and holding his breath, but neither of
the women looked around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two?&rdquo; Egwene exclaimed. &ldquo;Who else? Is it Kari? Kari Thane? Lara
Ayellan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine gave an exasperated click of her tongue, then said
sternly, &ldquo;You must forget I said that. Her road lies another way, I
fear. Concern yourself with your own circumstances. It is not an
easy road you have chosen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not turn back,&rdquo; Egwene said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be that as it may. But you
still want reassurance, and I cannot give it to you, not in the way
you want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want to know that Aes Sedai are good
and pure, that it was those wicked men of the legends who caused
the Breaking of the World, not the women. Well, it was the men, but
they were no more wicked than any men. They were insane, not evil.
The Aes Sedai you will find in Tar Valon are human, no different
from any other women except for the ability that sets us apart.
They are brave and cowardly, strong and weak, kind and cruel,
warm-hearted and cold. Becoming an Aes Sedai will not change you
from what you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene drew a heavy breath. &ldquo;I suppose I was afraid of that,
that I&rsquo;d be changed by the Power. That and the Trollocs. And the
Fade. And&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Moiraine Sedai, in the name of the Light, why did
the Trollocs come to Emond&rsquo;s Field?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai&rsquo;s head swung and she looked straight at Rand&rsquo;s
hiding place. His breath seized in his throat; her eyes were as
hard as when she had threatened them, and he had the feeling they
could penetrate the leatherleaf&rsquo;s thick branches. <em>Light, what will
she do if she finds me listening?</em></p>

<p>He tried to melt back into the deeper shadows. With his eyes on
the women, a root snagged his foot, and he barely caught himself
from tumbling into dead brush that would have pointed him out with
a crackle of snapping branches like fireworks. Panting, he
scrambled away on all fours, keeping silent as much by luck as by
anything he did. His heart pounded so hard he thought that might
give him away itself. <em>Fool! Eavesdropping on an Aes Sedai!</em></p>

<p>Back where the others were sleeping, he managed to slip in among
them silently. Lan moved as he dropped to the ground and jerked his
blanket up, but the Warder settled back with a sigh. He had only
been rolling over in his sleep. Rand let out a long, silent
breath.</p>

<p>A moment later Moiraine appeared out of the night, stopping
where she could study the slumbering shapes. Moonlight made a
nimbus around her. Rand closed his eyes and breathed evenly, all
the while listening hard for footsteps coming closer. None did.
When he opened his eyes again, she was gone.</p>

<p>When finally sleep came, it was fitful and filled with sweaty
dreams where all the men in Emond&rsquo;s Field claimed to be the Dragon
Reborn and all women had blue stones in their hair like the one
Moiraine wore. He did not try to overhear Moiraine and Egwene
again.</p>

<p>On into the sixth day the slow journey stretched. The warmthless
sun slid slowly toward the treetops, while a handful of thin clouds
drifted high to the north. The wind gusted higher for a moment, and
Rand pulled his cloak back up onto his shoulders, muttering to
himself. He wondered if they would ever get to Baerlon. The
distance they had traveled from the river already was more than
enough to take him from Taren Ferry to the White River, but Lan
always said it was just a short journey whenever he was asked,
hardly worth calling a journey at all. It made him feel lost.</p>

<p>Lan appeared ahead of them in the woods, returning from one of
his forays. He reined in and rode beside Moiraine, his head bent
close to hers.</p>

<p>Rand grimaced, but he did not ask any questions. Lan simply
refused to acknowledge all such questions aimed at him.</p>

<p>Only Egwene, among the others, even appeared to notice Lan&rsquo;s
return, so used to this arrangement had they become, and she kept
back, too. The Aes Sedai might have begun acting as if Egwene were
in charge of the Emond&rsquo;s Fielders, but that gave her no say when
the Warder made his reports. Perrin was carrying Mat&rsquo;s bow, wrapped
in the thoughtful silence that seemed to take them all more and
more as they got further from the Two Rivers. The horses&rsquo; slow walk
allowed Mat to practice juggling three small stones under Thom
Merrilin&rsquo;s watchful eye. The gleeman had given lessons each night,
too, as well as Lan.</p>

<p>Lan finished whatever he had been telling Moiraine, and she
twisted in her saddle to look back at the others. Rand tried not to
stiffen when her eyes moved across him. Did they linger on him a
moment longer than on anyone else? He had the queasy feeling that
she knew who had been listening in the darkness that night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, Rand,&rdquo; Mat called, &ldquo;I can juggle four!&rdquo; Rand waved in
reply without looking around. &ldquo;I told you I&rsquo;d get to four before
you. I&mdash;Look!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had topped a low hill, and below them, a scant mile away
through the stark trees and the stretching shadows of evening, lay
Baerlon. Rand gasped, trying to smile and gape at the same
time.</p>

<p>A log wall, nearly twenty feet tall, surrounded the town, with
wooden watchtowers scattered along its length. Within, rooftops of
slate and tile glinted with the sinking sun, and feathers of smoke
drifted upward from chimneys. Hundreds of chimneys. There was not a
thatched roof to be seen. A broad road ran east from the town, and
another west, each with at least a dozen wagons and twice as many
ox-carts trudging toward the palisade. Farms lay scattered about
the town, thickest to the north while only a few broke the forest
to the south, but they might as well not have existed so far as
Rand was concerned. <em>It&rsquo;s bigger than Emond&rsquo;s Field and Watch Hill
and Deven Ride all put together! And maybe Taren Ferry, too.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s a city,&rdquo; Mat breathed, leaning forward across his
horse&rsquo;s neck to stare.</p>

<p>Perrin could only shake his head. &ldquo;How can so many people live
in one place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene simply stared.</p>

<p>Thom Merrilin glanced at Mat, then rolled
his eyes and blew out his moustaches. &ldquo;City!&rdquo; he snorted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, Rand?&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;What do you think of your
first sight of Baerlon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a long way from home,&rdquo; he said slowly, bringing a
sharp laugh from Mat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have further to go yet,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;Much further. But
there is no other choice, except to run and hide and run again for
the rest of your lives. And short lives they would be. You must
remember that, when the journey becomes hard. You have no
choice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand exchanged glances with Mat and Perrin. By their faces, they
were thinking the same thing he was. How could she talk as if they
had any choice after what she had said? <em>The Aes Sedai&rsquo;s made our
choices</em>.</p>

<p>Moiraine went on as if their thoughts were not plain. &ldquo;The
danger begins again here. Watch what you say within those walls.
Above all, do not mention Trollocs, or Halfmen, or any such. You
must not even think of the Dark One. Some in Baerlon have even less
love for Aes Sedai than do the people of Emond&rsquo;s Field, and there
may even be Darkfriends.&rdquo; Egwene gasped, and Perrin muttered under
his breath. Mat&rsquo;s face paled, but Moiraine went on calmly. &ldquo;We must
attract as little attention as possible.&rdquo; Lan was exchanging his
cloak of shifting grays and greens for one of dark brown, more
ordinary, though of fine cut and weave. His color-changing cloak
made a large bulge in one of his saddlebags. &ldquo;We do not go by our
own names here,&rdquo; Moiraine continued. &ldquo;Here I am known as Alys, and
Lan is Andra. Remember that. Good. Let us be within the walls
before night catches us. The gates of Baerlon are closed from
sundown to sunrise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan led the way down the hill and through the woods toward the
log wall. The road passed half a dozen farms&mdash;none lay close, and
none of the people finishing their chores seemed to notice the
travelers&mdash;ending at heavy wooden gates bound with wide straps of
black iron. They were closed tight, even if the sun was not down
yet.</p>

<p>Lan rode close to the wall and gave a tug to a frayed rope
hanging down beside the gates. A bell clanged on the other side of
the wall. Abruptly a wizened face under a battered cloth cap peered
down suspiciously from atop the wall, glaring between the cut-off
ends of two of the logs, a good three spans over their heads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this, eh? It&rsquo;s too late in the day to be opening
this gate. Too late, I say. Go around to the Whitebridge Gate if
you want to&mdash;&rdquo; Moiraine&rsquo;s mare moved out to where the man
atop the wall had a clear view of her. Suddenly his wrinkles
deepened in a gap-toothed smile, and he seemed to quiver between
speaking and doing his duty. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know it was you, mistress.
Wait. I&rsquo;ll be right down. Just wait. I&rsquo;m coming. I&rsquo;m coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The head dipped out of sight, but Rand could still hear muffled
shouts for them to stay where they were, that he was coming. With
great creaks of disuse, the right-hand gate slowly swung outward.
It stopped when open just wide enough for one horse to pass through
at a time, and the gatekeeper poked his head into the gap, flashed
his half-toothless smile at them again and darted back out of the
way. Moiraine followed Lan through, with Egwene right behind
her.</p>

<p>Rand trotted Cloud after Bela and found himself in a narrow
street fronted by high wooden fences and warehouses, tall and
windowless, broad doors closed up tight. Moiraine and Lan were
already on foot, speaking to the wrinkle-faced gatekeeper, so Rand
dismounted, too.</p>

<p>The little man, in a much-mended cloak and coat, held his cloth
cap crumpled in one hand and ducked his head whenever he spoke. He
peered at those dismounting behind Lan and Moiraine, and shook his
head. &ldquo;Downcountry folk.&rdquo; He grinned. &ldquo;Why, Mistress Alys, you
taken up collecting downcountry folk with hay in their hair?&rdquo; His
look took in Thom Merrilin, then. &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t a sheepfarmer. I
remember letting you go through some days back, I do. Didn&rsquo;t like
your tricks downcountry, eh, gleeman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you remembered to forget letting us through, Master
Avin,&rdquo; Lan said, pressing a coin into the man&rsquo;s free hand. &ldquo;And
letting us back in, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No need for that, Master Andra. No need for that. You give me
plenty when you went out. Plenty.&rdquo; Just the same, Avin made the
coin disappear as deftly as if he were a gleeman, too. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t
told nobody, and I won&rsquo;t, neither. Especially not them
Whitecloaks,&rdquo; he finished with a scowl. He pursed up his lips to
spit, then glanced at Moiraine and swallowed, instead.</p>

<p>Rand blinked, but kept his mouth shut. The others did, too,
though it appeared to be an effort for Mat. <em>Children of the Light</em>,
Rand thought wonderingly. Stories told about the Children by
peddlers and merchants and merchants&rsquo; guards varied from admiration
to hatred, but all agreed the Children hated Aes Sedai as much as
they did Darkfriends. He wondered if this was more trouble
already.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Children are in Baerlon?&rdquo; Lan demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They surely are.&rdquo; The gatekeeper bobbed his head. &ldquo;Came the
same day you left, as I recall. Ain&rsquo;t nobody here likes them at
all. Most don&rsquo;t let on, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have they said why they are here?&rdquo; Moiraine asked intently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why they&rsquo;re here, mistress?&rdquo; Avin was so astonished he forgot
to duck his head. &ldquo;Of course, they said why&mdash;Oh, I forgot.
You been downcountry. Likely you ain&rsquo;t heard nothing but sheep
bleating. They say they&rsquo;re here because of what&rsquo;s going on down in
Ghealdan. The Dragon, you know&mdash;well, him as calls himself
Dragon. They say the fellow&rsquo;s stirring up evil&mdash;which I
expect he is&mdash;and they&rsquo;re here to stamp it out, only he&rsquo;s
down there in Ghealdan, not here. Just an excuse to meddle in other
people&rsquo;s business, is what I figure. There&rsquo;s already been the
Dragon&rsquo;s Fang on some people&rsquo;s doors.&rdquo; This time he did spit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have they caused much trouble, then?&rdquo; Lan said, and Avin shook
his head vigorously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that they don&rsquo;t want to, I expect, only the Governor don&rsquo;t
trust them no more than I do. He won&rsquo;t let but maybe ten or so
inside the walls at one time, and ain&rsquo;t they mad about that. The
rest have a camp a little ways north, I hear. Bet they got the
farmers looking over their shoulders. The ones that do come in,
they just stalk around in those white cloaks, looking down their
noses at honest folk. Walk in the Light, they say, and it&rsquo;s an
order. Near come to blows more than once with the wagoneers and
miners and smelters and all, and even the Watch, but the Governor
wants it all peaceful, and that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s been so far. If they&rsquo;re
hunting evil, I say why aren&rsquo;t they up in Saldaea? There&rsquo;s some
kind of trouble up there, I hear. Or down in Ghealdan? There&rsquo;s been
a big battle down there, they say. Real big.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine drew a soft breath. &ldquo;I had heard that Aes Sedai were
going to Ghealdan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they did, mistress.&rdquo; Avin&rsquo;s head started bobbing again.
&ldquo;They went to Ghealdan, all right, and that&rsquo;s what started this
battle, or so I hear. They say some of those Aes Sedai are dead.
Maybe all of them. I know some folks don&rsquo;t hold with Aes Sedai, but
I say, who else is going to stop a false Dragon? Eh? And those
damned fools who think they can be men Aes Sedai or some such. What
about them? Course, some say&mdash;not the Whitecloaks, mind, and
not me, but some folks&mdash;that maybe this fellow really is the
Dragon Reborn. He can do things, I hear. Use the One Power. There&rsquo;s
thousands following him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool,&rdquo; Lan snapped, and Avin&rsquo;s face folded into a
hurt look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only saying what I heard, ain&rsquo;t I? Just what I heard,
Master Andra. They say, some do, that he&rsquo;s moving his army east and
south, toward Tear.&rdquo; His voice became heavy with meaning. &ldquo;They say
he&rsquo;s named them the People of the Dragon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Names mean little,&rdquo; Moiraine said calmly. If anything she had
heard disturbed her, she gave no outward sign of it now. &ldquo;You could
call your mule People of the Dragon, if you wanted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not likely, mistress.&rdquo; Avin chuckled. &ldquo;Not with the Whitecloaks
around, for sure. I don&rsquo;t expect anybody else would look kindly on
a name like that, neither. I see what you mean, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;oh, no,
mistress. Not <em>my</em> mule.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt a wise decision,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;Now we must be
off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you worry, mistress,&rdquo; Avin said, with a deep bob of
his head, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t seen nobody.&rdquo; He darted to the gate and began
tugging it closed with quick jerks. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t seen nobody, and ain&rsquo;t
seen nothing.&rdquo; The gate thudded shut, and he pulled down the
locking bar with a rope. &ldquo;In fact, mistress, this gate ain&rsquo;t been
open in days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light illumine you, Avin,&rdquo; Moiraine said.</p>

<p>She led them away from the gate, then. Rand looked back, once,
and Avin was still standing in front of the gate. He seemed to be
polishing a coin with an edge of his cloak and chuckling.</p>

<p>The way led through dirt streets barely the width of two wagons,
empty of people, all lined with warehouses and occasional high,
wooden fences. Rand walked a time beside the gleeman. &ldquo;Thom, what
was all that about Tear, and the People of the Dragon? Tear is a
city all the way down on the Sea of Storms, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>The Karaethon Cycle</em>,&rdquo; Thom said curtly.</p>

<p>Rand blinked. <em>The Prophecies of the Dragon</em>. &ldquo;Nobody tells the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;those stories in the Two Rivers. Not in Emond&rsquo;s Field, anyway.
The Wisdom would skin them alive, if they did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose she would, at that,&rdquo; Thom said dryly. He glanced at
Moiraine up ahead with Lan, saw she could not overhear, and went
on. &ldquo;Tear is the greatest port on the Sea of Storms, and the Stone
of Tear is the fortress that guards it. The Stone is said to be the
first fortress built after the Breaking of the World, and in all
this time it has never fallen, though more than one army has tried.
One of the Prophecies says that the Stone of Tear will never fall
until the People of the Dragon come to the Stone. Another says the
Stone will never fall till the Sword That Cannot Be Touched is
wielded by the Dragon&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo; Thom grimaced. &ldquo;The fall of the
Stone will be one of the major proofs that the Dragon has been
reborn. May the Stone stand till I am dust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sword that cannot be touched?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it says. I don&rsquo;t know whether it really is a sword.
Whatever it is, it lies in the Heart of the Stone, the central
citadel of the fortress. None but the Great Lords of Tear can enter
there, and they never speak of what lies inside. Certainly not to
gleemen, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand frowned. &ldquo;The Stone cannot fall until the Dragon wields the
sword, but how can he, unless the Stone has already fallen? Is the
Dragon supposed to be a Great Lord of Tear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much chance of that,&rdquo; the gleeman said dryly. &ldquo;Tear hates
anything to do with the Power even more than Amador, and Amador is
the stronghold of the Children of the Light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then how can the Prophecy be fulfilled?&rdquo; Rand asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like
it well enough if the Dragon was never reborn, but a prophecy that
cannot be fulfilled doesn&rsquo;t make much sense. It sounds like a story
meant to make people think the Dragon never will be reborn. Is that
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ask an awful lot of questions, boy,&rdquo; Thom said. &ldquo;A prophecy
that was easily fulfilled would not be worth much, now would it?&rdquo;
Suddenly his voice brightened. &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re here. Wherever here is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan had stopped by a section of head-high wooden fence that
looked no different from any other they had passed. He was working
the blade of his dagger between two of the boards. Abruptly he gave
a grunt of satisfaction, pulled, and a length of the fence swung
out like a gate. In fact it was a gate, Rand saw, though one meant
to be opened only from the other side. The metal latch that Lan had
lifted with his dagger showed that.</p>

<p>Moiraine went through immediately, drawing Aldieb behind her.
Lan motioned the others to follow, and brought up the rear, closing
the gate behind him.</p>

<p>On the other side of the fence Rand found himself in the
stableyard of an inn. A loud bustle and clatter came from the
building&rsquo;s kitchen, but what struck him was its size; it covered
more than twice as much ground as the Winespring Inn, and was four
stories high besides. Well over half the windows were aglow in the
deepening twilight. He wondered at this city that could have so
many strangers in it.</p>

<p>No sooner had they come well into the stableyard than three men
in dirty canvas aprons appeared at the huge stable&rsquo;s broad, arched
doors. One, a wiry fellow and the only one without a manure fork in
his hands, came forward waving his arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here! Here! You can&rsquo;t come in that way! You&rsquo;ll have to go round
the front!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan&rsquo;s hand went to his purse again, but even as it did another
man, as big around as Master al&rsquo;Vere, came hurrying out of the inn.
Puffs of hair stuck out above his ears, and his sparkling white
apron was as good as a sign proclaiming him the innkeeper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Mutch,&rdquo; the newcomer said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right.
These folk are expected guests. Take care of their horses, now.
Good care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mutch sullenly knuckled his forehead, then motioned his two
companions to come help. Rand and the others hurriedly got their
saddlebags and blanketrolls down while the innkeeper turned to
Moiraine. He gave her a deep bow, and spoke with a genuine
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome, Mistress Alys. Welcome. It&rsquo;s good to be seeing you,
you and Master Andra, both. Very good. Your fine conversation has
been missed. Yes, it has. I must say I worried, you going
downcountry and all. Well, I mean, at a time like this, with the
weather all crazy and wolves howling right up to the walls in the
night.&rdquo; Abruptly he slapped both hands against his round belly and
shook his head. &ldquo;Here I go on like this, chattering away, instead
of taking you inside. Come. Come. Hot meals and warm beds, that&rsquo;s
what you&rsquo;ll be wanting. And the best in Baerlon are right here. The
very best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And hot baths, too, I trust, Master Fitch?&rdquo; Moiraine said, and
Egwene echoed her fervently. &ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Baths?&rdquo; the innkeeper said. &ldquo;Why, just the best and the hottest
in Baerlon. Come. Welcome to the Stag and Lion. Welcome to
Baerlon.&rdquo;</p>
