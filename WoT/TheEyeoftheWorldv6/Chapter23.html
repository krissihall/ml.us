the start Perrin knew the journey to Caemlyn was going to
be far from comfortable, beginning with Egwene&rsquo;s insistence that
they take turns riding Bela. They did not know how far it was, she
said, but it was too far for her to be the only one who rode. Her
jaw firmed, and her eyes stared at him unblinking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too big to ride Bela,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m used to walking, and
I&rsquo;d rather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I am not used to walking?&rdquo; Egwene said sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t what I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the only one who&rsquo;s supposed to get saddlesore, is that it?
And when you walk till your feet are ready to fall off, you&rsquo;ll
expect me to look after you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let it be,&rdquo; he breathed when she looked like going on. &ldquo;Anyway,
you&rsquo;ll take the first turn.&rdquo; Her face turned even more stubborn,
but he refused to let her get a word in edgewise. &ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t get
in the saddle by yourself, I&rsquo;ll put you there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave him a startled look, and a small smile curved her lips.
&ldquo;In that case&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She sounded as if she were about to laugh, but
she climbed up.</p>

<p>He grumbled to himself as he turned away from the river. Leaders
in stories never had to put up with this sort of thing.</p>

<p>Egwene did insist on him taking his turns, and whenever he tried
to avoid it, she bullied him into the saddle. Blacksmithing did not
lend itself to a slender build, and Bela was not very large as
horses went. Every time he put his foot in the stirrup the shaggy
mare looked at him with what he was sure was reproach. Small
things, perhaps, but they irritated. Soon he flinched whenever
Egwene announced, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your turn, Perrin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In stories leaders seldom flinched, and they were never bullied.
But, he reflected, they never had to deal with Egwene, either.</p>

<p>There were only short rations of bread and cheese to begin with,
and what there was gave out by the end of the first day. Perrin set
snares along likely rabbit runs&mdash;they looked old, but it was
worth a chance&mdash;while Egwene began laying a fire. When he was
done, he decided to try his hand with his sling before the light
failed altogether. They had not seen a sign of anything at all
alive, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;To his surprise, he jumped a scrawny rabbit almost
at once. He was so surprised when it burst from under a bush right
beneath his feet that it almost got away, but he fetched it at
forty paces, just as it was darting around a tree.</p>

<p>When he came back to the camp with the rabbit, Egwene had broken
limbs all laid for the fire, but she was kneeling beside the pile
with her eyes closed. &ldquo;What are you doing? You can&rsquo;t wish a
fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene gave a jump at his first words, and twisted around to
stare at him with a hand to her throat. &ldquo;You&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;you startled
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was lucky,&rdquo; he said, holding up the rabbit. &ldquo;Get your flint
and steel. We eat well tonight, at least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a flint,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;It was in my pocket,
a
