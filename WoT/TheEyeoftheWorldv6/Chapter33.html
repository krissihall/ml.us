<h4><em>The Dark Waits</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">U</span>nder
a leaden sky the high-wheeled cart bumped east
along the Caemlyn Road. Rand pulled himself out of the straw in
back to look over the side. It was easier than it had been an hour
earlier. His arms felt as if they might stretch instead of drawing
him up, and for a minute his head wanted to keep on going and float
away, but it was easier. He hooked his elbows over the low slats
and watched the land roll past. The sun, still hidden by dull
clouds, yet stood high overhead, but the cart was clattering into
another village of vine-covered, red brick houses. Towns had been
getting closer together since Four Kings.</p>

<p>Some of the people waved or called a greeting to Hyam
Kinch, the farmer whose cart it was. Master Kinch, leathery-faced
and taciturn, shouted back a few words each time, around the pipe
in his teeth. The clenched teeth made what he said all but
unintelligible, but it sounded jovial and seemed to satisfy; they
went back to what they were doing without another glance at the
cart. No one appeared to pay any mind to the farmer&rsquo;s two
passengers.</p>

<p>The village inn moved through Rand&rsquo;s field of vision.
It was whitewashed, with a gray slate roof. People bustled in and
out, nodding casually and waving to one another. Some of them
stopped to speak. They knew one another. Villagers, mostly, by
their clothes&mdash;boots and trousers and coats not much different from
what he wore himself, though with an inordinate fondness for
colorful stripes. The women wore deep bonnets that hid their faces
and white aprons with stripes. Maybe they were all townsmen and
local farmfolk. <em>Does that make any difference?</em></p>

<p>He dropped back on the straw, watching the village
dwindle between his feet. Fenced fields and trimmed hedges lined
the road, and small farmhouses with smoke rising from red brick
chimneys. The only woods near the road were coppices, well tended
for firewood, tame as a farmyard. But the branches stood leafless
against the sky, as stark as in the wild woods to the west.</p>

<p>A line of wagons heading the other way rumbled down
the center of the road, crowding the cart over onto the verge.
Master Kinch shifted his pipe to the corner of his mouth and spat
between his teeth. With one eye on his off-side wheel, to make sure
it did not tangle in the hedge, he kept the cart moving. His mouth
tightened as he glanced at the merchants&rsquo; train.</p>

<p>None of the wagon drivers cracking their long whips
in the air above eight-horse teams, none of the hard-faced guards
slouching in their saddles alongside the wagons, looked at the
cart. Rand watched them go, his chest tight. His hand was under his
cloak, gripping his sword hilt, until the last wagon lurched
by.</p>

<p>As that final wagon rattled away toward the village
they had just left, Mat turned on the seat beside the farmer and
leaned back until he found Rand&rsquo;s eyes. The scarf that did duty for
dust, when need be, shaded his own eyes, folded over thickly and
tied low around his forehead. Even so he squinted in the gray
daylight. &ldquo;You see anything back there?&rdquo; he asked quietly. &ldquo;What
about the wagons?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shook his head, and Mat nodded. He had seen
nothing either.</p>

<p>Master Kinch glanced at them out of the corner of his
eye, then shifted his pipe again, and flapped the reins. That was
all, but he had noticed. The horse picked up the pace a step.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your eyes still hurt?&rdquo; Rand asked.</p>

<p>Mat touched the scarf around his head. &ldquo;No. Not much.
Not unless I look almost right at the sun, anyway. What about you?
Are you feeling any better?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some.&rdquo; He really was feeling better, he realized. It
was a wonder to get over being sick so fast. More than that, it was
a gift of the Light. <em>It has to be the Light. It has to
be</em>.</p>

<p>Suddenly a body of horsemen was passing the cart,
heading west like the merchants&rsquo; wagons. Long white collars hung
down over their mail and plate, and their cloaks and undercoats
were red, like the gatetenders&rsquo; uniforms in Whitebridge, but better
made and better fitting. Each man&rsquo;s conical helmet shone like
silver. They sat their horses with straight backs. Thin red
streamers fluttered beneath the heads of their lances, every lance
held at the same angle.</p>

<p>Some of them glanced into the cart as they passed in
two columns. A cage of steel bars masked each face. Rand was glad
his cloak covered his sword. A few nodded to Master Kinch, not as
if they knew him, but in a neutral greeting. Master Kinch nodded
back in much the same way, but despite his unchanging expression
there was a hint of approval in his nod.</p>

<p>Their horses were at a walk, but with the speed of
the cart added, they went by quickly. With a part of his mind Rand
counted them. Ten&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;twenty&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;thirty&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;thirty-two. He
raised his head to watch the columns move on down the Caemlyn
Road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who were they?&rdquo; Mat asked, half wondering, half
suspicious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s Guards,&rdquo; Master Kinch said around his pipe.
He kept his eyes on the road ahead. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t go much further than
Breen&rsquo;s Spring, &rsquo;less they&rsquo;re called for. Not like the old days.&rdquo;
He sucked on his pipe, then added, &ldquo;I suppose, these days, there&rsquo;s
parts of the Realm don&rsquo;t see the Guards in a year or more. Not like
the old days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are they doing?&rdquo; Rand asked.</p>

<p>The farmer gave him a look. &ldquo;Keeping the Queen&rsquo;s
peace and upholding the Queen&rsquo;s law.&rdquo; He nodded to himself as if he
liked the sound of that, and added, &ldquo;Searching out malefactors and
seeing them before a magistrate. Mmmph!&rdquo; He let out a long streamer
of smoke. &ldquo;You two must be from pretty far off not to recognize the
Queen&rsquo;s Guard. Where you from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Far off,&rdquo; Mat said at the same instant that Rand
said, &ldquo;The Two Rivers.&rdquo; He wished he could take it back as soon as
he said it. He still was not thinking clearly. Trying to hide, and
mentioning a name a Fade would hear like a bell.</p>

<p>Master Kinch glanced at Mat out of the corner of his
eye, and puffed his pipe in silence for a while. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s far off,
all right,&rdquo; he said finally. &ldquo;Almost to the border of the Realm.
But things must be worse than I thought if there&rsquo;s places in the
Realm where people don&rsquo;t even <em>recognize</em> the Queen&rsquo;s
Guards. Not like the old days at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand wondered what Master al&rsquo;Vere would say if
someone told him the Two Rivers was part of some Queen&rsquo;s Realm. The
Queen of Andor, he supposed. Perhaps the Mayor did know&mdash;he
knew a lot of things that surprised Rand&mdash;and maybe others
did, too, but he had never heard anyone mention it. The Two Rivers
was the Two Rivers. Each village handled its own problems, and if
some difficulty involved more than one village the Mayors, and
maybe the Village Councils, solved it between them.</p>

<p>Master Kinch pulled on the reins, drawing the cart to
a halt. &ldquo;Far as I go.&rdquo; A narrow cart path led off to the north;
several farmhouses were visible in that direction across open
fields, plowed but still bare of crops. &ldquo;Two days will see you in
Caemlyn. Least, it would if your friend had his legs under
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat hopped down and retrieved his bow and other
things, then helped Rand climb off the tail of the cart. Rand&rsquo;s
bundles weighed on him, and his legs wobbled, but he shrugged off
his friend&rsquo;s hand and tried a few steps on his own. He still felt
unsteady, but his legs held him up. They even seemed to grow
stronger as he used them.</p>

<p>The farmer did not start his horse up again right
away. He studied them for a minute, sucking on his pipe. &ldquo;You can
rest up a day or two at my place, if you want. Won&rsquo;t miss anything
in that time, I suppose. Whatever sickness you&rsquo;re getting over,
young fellow&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well, the old woman and me, we already had about
every sickness you can think of before you were born, and nursed
our younglings through &rsquo;em, too. I expect you&rsquo;re past the catching
stage, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat&rsquo;s eyes narrowed, and Rand caught himself
frowning. <em>Not everyone is part of it. It can&rsquo;t be
everybody</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m all right. Really. How
far to the next village?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carysford? You can reach it before dark, walking.&rdquo;
Master Kinch took his pipe from between his teeth and pursed his
lips thoughtfully before going on. &ldquo;First off, I reckoned you for
runaway &rsquo;prentices, but now I expect it&rsquo;s something more serious
you&rsquo;re running from. Don&rsquo;t know what. Don&rsquo;t care. I&rsquo;m a good enough
judge to say you&rsquo;re not Darkfriends, and not likely to rob or hurt
anybody. Not like some on the road these days. I got in trouble a
time or two myself when I was your age. You need a place to keep
out of sight a few days, my farm is five miles that way&rdquo;&mdash;he
jerked his head toward the cart track&mdash;&ldquo;and don&rsquo;t nobody ever
come out there. Whatever&rsquo;s chasing you, won&rsquo;t likely find you
there.&rdquo; He cleared his throat as if embarrassed by speaking so many
words together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How would you know what Darkfriends look like?&rdquo; Mat
demanded. He backed away from the cart, and his hand went under his
coat. &ldquo;What do you know about Darkfriends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master Kinch&rsquo;s face tightened. &ldquo;Suit yourselves,&rdquo; he
said, and clucked to his horse. The cart rolled off down the narrow
path, and he never looked back.</p>

<p>Mat looked at Rand, and his scowl faded. &ldquo;Sorry,
Rand. You need a place to rest. Maybe if we go after him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He
shrugged. &ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t get over the feeling that everybody&rsquo;s after
us. Light, I wish I knew why they were. I wish it was over. I wish&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He trailed off miserably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are still some good people,&rdquo; Rand said. Mat
started toward the cart path, jaw clenched as if it were the last
thing he wanted to do, but Rand stopped him. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford to
stop just to rest, Mat. Besides, I don&rsquo;t think there is anywhere to
hide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat nodded, his relief evident. He tried to take some
of Rand&rsquo;s burdens, the saddlebags and Thom&rsquo;s cloak wrapped around
the cased harp, but Rand held onto them. His legs really did feel
stronger. <em>Whatever&rsquo;s chasing us?</em> he thought as they
started off down the road. <em>Not chasing. Waiting</em>.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The rain had continued through the night they
staggered away from The Dancing Cartman, hammering at them as hard
as the thunder out of a black sky split by lightning. Their clothes
became sodden in minutes; in an hour Rand&rsquo;s skin felt sodden, too,
but they had left Four Kings behind them. Mat was all but blind in
the dark, squinting painfully at the sharp flashes that made trees
stand out starkly for an instant. Rand led him by the hand, but Mat
still felt out each step uncertainly. Worry creased Rand&rsquo;s
forehead. If Mat did not regain his sight, they would be slowed to
a crawl. They would never get away.</p>

<p>Mat seemed to sense his thought. Despite the hood of
his cloak, the rain had plastered Mat&rsquo;s hair across his face.
&ldquo;Rand,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t leave me, will you? If I can&rsquo;t keep
up?&rdquo; His voice quavered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t leave you.&rdquo; Rand tightened his grip on his
friend&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t leave you no matter what.&rdquo; <em>Light help
us!</em> Thunder crashed overhead, and Mat stumbled, almost
falling, almost pulling him down, too. &ldquo;We have to stop, Mat. If we
keep going, you&rsquo;ll break a leg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gode.&rdquo; Lightning split the dark right above them as
Mat spoke, and the thunder crack pounded every other sound into the
ground, but in the flash Rand could make out the name on Mat&rsquo;s
lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo; <em>He has to be. Light, let him he
dead</em>.</p>

<p>He led Mat to some bushes the lightning flash had
showed him. They had leaves enough to give a little shelter from
the driving rain. Not as much as a good tree might, but he did not
want to risk another lightning strike. They might not be so lucky,
next time.</p>

<p>Huddled together beneath the bushes, they tried to
arrange their cloaks to make a little tent over the branches. It
was far too late to think of staying dry, but just stopping the
incessant pelting of the raindrops would be something. They
crouched against each other to share what little body warmth was
left to them. Dripping wet as they were, and more drips coming
through the cloaks, they shivered themselves into sleep.</p>

<p>Rand knew right away it was a dream. He was back in
Four Kings, but the town was empty except for him. The wagons were
there, but no people, no horses, no dogs. Nothing alive. He knew
someone was waiting for him, though.</p>

<p>As he walked down the rutted street, the buildings
seemed to blur as they slid behind him. When he turned his head,
they were all there, solid, but the indistinctness remained at the
corners of his vision. It was as if only what he saw really
existed, and then just while he was seeing. He was sure if he
turned quickly enough he would see&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He was not sure what, but
it made him uneasy, thinking about it.</p>

<p>The Dancing Cartman appeared in front of him. Somehow
its garish paint seemed gray and lifeless. He went in. Gode was
there, at a table.</p>

<p>He only recognized the man from his clothes, his silk
and dark velvets. Gode&rsquo;s skin was red, burned and cracked and
oozing. His face was almost a skull, his lips shriveled to bare
teeth and gums. As Gode turned his head, some of his hair cracked
off, powdering to soot when it hit his shoulder. His lidless eyes
stared at Rand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you are dead,&rdquo; Rand said. He was surprised that
he was not afraid. Perhaps it was knowing that it was a dream this
time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ba&rsquo;alzamon&rsquo;s voice, &ldquo;but he did find you
for me. That deserves some reward, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand turned, and discovered he could be afraid, even
knowing it was a dream. Ba&rsquo;alzamon&rsquo;s clothes were the color of
dried blood, and rage and hate and triumph battled on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, youngling, you cannot hide from me forever.
One way or another I find you. What protects you also makes you
vulnerable. One time you hide, the next you light a signal fire.
Come to me, youngling.&rdquo; He held out his hand to Rand. &ldquo;If my hounds
must pull you down, they may not be gentle. They are jealous of
what you will be, once you have knelt at my feet. It is your
destiny. You belong to me.&rdquo; Gode&rsquo;s burned tongue made an angry,
eager garble of sound.</p>

<p>Rand tried to wet his lips, but he had no spit in his
mouth. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he managed, and then the words came more easily. &ldquo;I
belong to myself. Not you. Not ever. Myself. If your Darkfriends
kill me, you&rsquo;ll never have me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fires in Ba&rsquo;alzamon&rsquo;s face heated the room till
the air swam. &ldquo;Alive or dead, youngling, you are mine. The grave
belongs to me. Easier dead, but better alive. Better for you,
youngling. The living have more power in most things.&rdquo; Gode made a
gabbling sound again. &ldquo;Yes, my good hound. Here is your
reward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand looked at Gode just in time to see the man&rsquo;s
body crumble to dust. For an instant the burned face held a look of
sublime joy that turned to horror in the final moment, as if he had
seen something waiting he did not expect. Gode&rsquo;s empty velvet
garments settled on the chair and the floor among the ash.</p>

<p>When he turned back, Ba&rsquo;alzamon&rsquo;s outstretched hand
had become a fist. &ldquo;You are mine, youngling, alive or dead. The Eye
of the World will never serve you. I mark you as mine.&rdquo; His fist
opened, and a ball of flame shot out. It struck Rand in the face,
exploding, searing.</p>

<p>Rand lurched awake in the dark, water dripping
through the cloaks onto his face. His hand trembled as he touched
his cheeks. The skin felt tender, as if sunburned.</p>

<p>Suddenly he realized Mat was twisting and moaning in
his sleep. He shook him, and Mat came awake with a whimper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My eyes! Oh, Light, my eyes! He took my eyes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand held him close, cradling him against his chest
as if he were a baby. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right, Mat. You&rsquo;re all right. He
can&rsquo;t hurt us. We won&rsquo;t let him.&rdquo; He could feel Mat shaking,
sobbing into his coat. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t hurt us,&rdquo; he whispered, and wished
he believed it. <em>What protects you makes you vulnerable. I am
going mad</em>.</p>

<p>Just before first light the downpour dwindled, the
last drizzle fading as dawn came. The clouds remained, threatening
until well into the morning. The wind came up, then, driving the
clouds off to the south, baring a warmthless sun and slicing
through their dripping wet clothes. They had not slept again, but
groggily they donned their cloaks and set off eastward, Rand
leading Mat by the hand. After a while Mat even felt well enough to
complain about what the rain had done to his bowstring. Rand would
not let him stop to exchange it for a dry string from his pocket,
though; not yet.</p>

<p>They came on another village shortly after midday.
Rand shivered harder at the sight of snug brick houses and smoke
rising from chimneys, but he kept clear, leading Mat through the
woods and fields to the south. A lone farmer working with a spading
fork in a muddy field was the only person he saw, and he took care
that the man did not see them, crouching through the trees. The
farmer&rsquo;s attention was all on his work, but Rand kept one eye on
him till he was lost to sight. If any of Gode&rsquo;s men were alive,
perhaps they would believe he and Mat had taken the southern road
out of Four Kings when they could not find anyone who had seen them
in this village. They came back to the road out of sight of the
town, and walked their clothes, if not dry, at least to just
damp.</p>

<p>An hour beyond the town a farmer gave them a ride in
his half-empty haywain. Rand had been taken by surprise while lost
in worry about Mat. Mat shielded his eyes from the sun with his
hand, weak as the afternoon light was, squinting through slitted
lids even so, and he muttered continually about how bright the sun
was. When Rand heard the rumble of the haywain, it was too late
already. The sodden road deadened sound, and the wagon with its
two-horse hitch was only fifty yards behind them, the driver
already peering at them.</p>

<p>To Rand&rsquo;s surprise he drew up and offered them a
lift. Rand hesitated, but it was too late to avoid being seen, and
refusing a ride might fix them in the man&rsquo;s mind. He helped Mat up
to the seat beside the farmer, then climbed up behind him.</p>

<p>Alpert Mull was a stolid man, with a square face and
square hands, both worn and grooved from hard work and worry, and
he wanted someone to talk to. His cows had gone dry, his chickens
had stopped laying, and there was no pasture worth the name. For
the first time in memory he had had to buy hay, and half a wagon
was all &ldquo;old Bain&rdquo; would let him have. He wondered whether there
was any chance of getting hay on his own land this year, or any
kind of crop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Queen should do something, the Light illumine
her,&rdquo; he muttered, knuckling his forehead respectfully but
absentmindedly.</p>

<p>He hardly looked at Rand or Mat, but when he let them
down by the narrow, rail-lined track that led off to his farm, he
hesitated, then said, almost as if to himself, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what
you&rsquo;re running from, and I don&rsquo;t want to. I have a wife and
children. You understand? My family. It&rsquo;s hard times for helping
strangers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat tried to stick his hand under his coat, but Rand
had his wrist and he held on. He stood in the road, looking at the
man without speaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I was a good man,&rdquo; Mull said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d offer a couple
of lads soaked to the skin a place to dry out and get warm in front
of my fire. But it&rsquo;s hard times, and strangers&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know
what you&rsquo;re running from, and I don&rsquo;t want to. You understand? My
family.&rdquo; Suddenly he pulled two long, woolen scarves, dark and
thick, out of his coat pocket. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not much, but here. Belong to
my boys. They have others. You don&rsquo;t know me, understand? It&rsquo;s hard
times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We never even saw you,&rdquo; Rand agreed as he took the
scarves. &ldquo;You <em>are</em> a good man. The best we&rsquo;ve met in
days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The farmer looked surprised, then grateful. Gathering
his reins, he turned his horses down the narrow lane. Before he
completed the turn Rand was leading Mat on down the Caemlyn
Road.</p>

<p>The wind stiffened as dusk closed in. Mat began to
ask querulously when they were going to stop, but Rand kept moving,
pulling Mat behind him, searching for more shelter than a spot
under a hedge. With their clothes still clammy and the wind getting
colder by the minute, he was not sure they could survive another
night in the open. Night fell without him spotting anything useful.
The wind grew icy, beating his cloak. Then, through the darkness
ahead, he saw lights. A village.</p>

<p>His hand slid into his pocket, feeling the coins
there. More than enough for a meal and a room for the two of them.
A room out of the cold night. If they stayed in the open, in the
wind and cold in damp clothes, anyone who found them would likely
as not find only two corpses. They just had to keep from attracting
any more notice than they could help. No playing the flute, and
with his eyes, Mat certainly could not juggle. He grasped Mat&rsquo;s
hand again and set out toward the beckoning lights.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When are we going to stop?&rdquo; Mat asked again. The way
he peered ahead, with his head stuck forward, Rand was not sure if
Mat could see him, much less the village lights.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When we&rsquo;re somewhere warm,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>Pools of light from house windows lit the streets of
the town, and people walked them unconcerned with what might be out
in the dark. The only inn was a sprawling building, all on one
floor, with the look of having had rooms added in bunches over the
years without any particular plan. The front door opened to let
someone out, and a wave of laughter rolled out after him.</p>

<p>Rand froze in the street, the drunken laughter at The
Dancing Cartman echoing in his head. He watched the man go down the
street with a none-too-steady stride, then took a deep breath and
pushed the door open. He took care that his cloak covered his
sword. Laughter swept over him.</p>

<p>Lamps hanging from the high ceiling made the room
bright, and right away he could see and feel the difference from
Saml Hake&rsquo;s inn. There was no drunkenness here, for one thing. The
room was filled with people who looked to be farmers and townsmen,
if not entirely sober, not too far from it. The laughter was real,
if a bit forced around the edges. People laughing to forget their
troubles, but with true mirth in it, too. The common room itself
was neat and clean, and warm from a fire roaring in a big fireplace
at the far end. The serving maids&rsquo; smiles were as warm as the fire,
and when they laughed Rand could tell it was because they wanted
to.</p>

<p>The innkeeper was as clean as his inn, with a
gleaming white apron around his bulk. Rand was glad to see he was a
stout man; he doubted if he would ever again trust a skinny
innkeeper. His name was Rulan Allwine&mdash;good omen, Rand
thought, with so much of the sound of Emond&rsquo;s Field to it&mdash;and he eyed them up and down, then politely mentioned paying in
advance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not suggesting you&rsquo;re the sort, understand, but
there&rsquo;s some on the road these days aren&rsquo;t too particular about
paying up come morning. Seems to be a lot of young folks headed for
Caemlyn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand was not offended, not as damp and bedraggled as
he was. When Master Allwine mentioned the price, though, his eyes
widened, and Mat made a sound as if he had choked on something.</p>

<p>The innkeeper&rsquo;s jowls swung as he shook his head
regretfully, but he seemed to be used to it. &ldquo;Times are hard,&rdquo; he
said in a resigned voice. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much, and what there is
costs five times what it used to. It&rsquo;ll be more next month, I&rsquo;ll
lay oath on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand dug his money out and looked at Mat. Mat&rsquo;s mouth
tightened stubbornly. &ldquo;You want to sleep under a hedge?&rdquo; Rand
asked. Mat sighed and reluctantly emptied his pocket. When the
reckoning was paid, Rand grimaced at the little that remained to
divide with Mat.</p>

<p>But ten minutes later they were eating stew at a
table in a corner near the fireplace, pushing it onto their spoons
with chunks of bread. The portions were not as large as Rand could
have wished, but they were hot, and filling. Warmth from the hearth
seeped into him slowly. He pretended to keep his eyes on his plate,
but he watched the door intently. Those who came in or went out all
looked like farmers, but it was not enough to quiet his fear.</p>

<p>Mat ate slowly, savoring each bite, though he
muttered about the light from the lamps. After a time he dug out
the scarf Alpert Mull had given him and wound it around his
forehead, pulling it down until his eyes were almost hidden. That
got them some looks Rand wished they could have avoided. He cleaned
his plate hurriedly, urging Mat to do the same, then asked Master
Allwine for their room.</p>

<p>The innkeeper seemed surprised that they were
retiring so early, but he made no comment. He got a candle and
showed them through a jumble of corridors to a small room, with two
narrow beds, back in a far corner of the inn. When he left, Rand
dropped his bundles beside his bed, tossed his cloak over a chair,
and fell on the coverlet fully dressed. All of his clothes were
still damp and uncomfortable, but if they had to run, he wanted to
be ready. He left the sword belt on, too, and slept with his hand
on the hilt.</p>

<p>A rooster crowing jerked him awake in the morning. He
lay there, watching dawn lighten the window, and wondered if he
dared sleep a little longer. Sleep during daylight, when they could
be moving. A yawn made his jaws crack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Mat exclaimed, &ldquo;I can see!&rdquo; He sat up on his
bed, squinting around the room. &ldquo;Some, anyway. Your face is still a
little blurry, but I can tell who you are. I knew I&rsquo;d be all right.
By tonight I&rsquo;ll see better than you do. Again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand sprang out of bed, scratching as he scooped up
his cloak. His clothes were wrinkled from drying on him while he
slept, and they itched. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re wasting daylight,&rdquo; he said. Mat
scrambled up as fast as he had; he was scratching, too.</p>

<p>Rand did feel good. They were a day away from Four
Kings, and none of Gode&rsquo;s men had showed up. A day closer to
Caemlyn, where Moiraine would be waiting for them. She would. No
more worrying about Darkfriends once they were back with the Aes
Sedai and the Warder. It was strange to be looking forward so much
to being with an Aes Sedai. <em>Light, when I see Moiraine again,
I&rsquo;ll kiss her!</em> He laughed at the thought. He felt good enough
to invest some of their dwindling stock of coins in breakfast&mdash;a big loaf of bread and a pitcher of milk, cold from the
springhouse.</p>

<p>They were eating in the back of the common room when
a young man came in, a village youth by the look of him, with a
cocky spring to his walk and twirling a cloth cap, with a feather
in it, on one finger. The only other person in the room was an old
man sweeping out; he never looked up from his broom. The young
man&rsquo;s eyes swept jauntily around the room, but when they lit on
Rand and Mat, the cap fell off his finger. He stared at them for a
full minute before snatching the cap from the floor, then stared
some more, running his fingers through his thick head of dark
curls. Finally he came over to their table, his feet dragging.</p>

<p>He was older than Rand, but he stood looking down at
them diffidently. &ldquo;Mind if I sit down?&rdquo; he asked, and immediately
swallowed hard as if he might have said the wrong thing.</p>

<p>Rand thought he might be hoping to share their
breakfast, though he looked able to buy his own. His blue-striped
shirt was embroidered around the collar, and his dark blue cloak
all around the hem. His leather boots had never been near any work
that scuffed them that Rand could see. He nodded to a chair.</p>

<p>Mat stared at the fellow as he drew the chair to the
table. Rand could not tell if he was glaring or just trying to see
clearly. In any case, Mat&rsquo;s frown had an effect. The young man
froze halfway to sitting, and did not lower himself all the way
until Rand nodded again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; Rand asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name? My name. Ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;call me Paitr.&rdquo; His eyes
shifted nervously. &ldquo;Ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;this is not my idea, you understand. I
have to do it. I didn&rsquo;t want to, but they made me. You have to
understand that. I don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand was beginning to tense when Mat growled,
&ldquo;Darkfriend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paitr gave a jerk and half lifted out of his chair,
staring wildly around the room as if there were fifty people to
overhear. The old man&rsquo;s head was still bent over the broom, his
attention on the floor. Paitr sat back down and looked from Rand to
Mat and back uncertainly. Sweat beaded on his upper lip. It was
accusation enough to make anyone sweat, but he said not a word
against it.</p>

<p>Rand shook his head slowly. After Gode, he knew that
Darkfriends did not necessarily have the Dragon&rsquo;s Fang on their
foreheads, but except for his clothes this Paitr could have fit
right in Emond&rsquo;s Field. Nothing about him hinted at murder and
worse. Nobody would have remarked him twice. At least Gode had been&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;different.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave us alone,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;And tell your friends
to leave us alone. We want nothing from them, and they&rsquo;ll get
nothing from us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Mat added fiercely, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll name you
for what you are. See what your village friends think of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand hoped he did not really mean it. That could
cause as much trouble for the two of them as it did for Paitr.</p>

<p>Paitr seemed to take the threat seriously. His face
grew pale. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I heard what happened at Four Kings. Some of
it, anyway. Word travels. We have ways of hearing things. But
there&rsquo;s nobody here to trap you. I&rsquo;m alone, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and I just
want to talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About what?&rdquo; Mat asked at the same time that Rand
said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not interested.&rdquo; They looked at each other, and Mat
shrugged. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not interested,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Rand gulped the last of the milk and stuffed the heel
of his half of the bread into his pocket. With their money almost
gone, it might be their next meal.</p>

<p>How to leave the inn? If Paitr discovered that Mat
was almost blind, he would tell others&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;other Darkfriends.
Once Rand had seen a wolf separate a crippled sheep from the flock;
there were other wolves around, and he could neither leave the
flock nor get a clear shot with his bow. As soon as the sheep was
alone, bleating with terror, hobbling frantically on three legs,
the one wolf chasing it became ten as if by magic. The memory of it
turned his stomach. They could not stay there, either. Even if
Paitr was telling the truth about being alone, how long would he
stay that way?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time to go, Mat,&rdquo; he said, and held his breath. As
Mat started to stand, he pulled Paitr&rsquo;s eyes to himself by leaning
forward and saying, &ldquo;Leave us alone, Darkfriend. I won&rsquo;t tell you
again. Leave&mdash;us&mdash;alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paitr swallowed hard and pressed back in his chair;
there was no blood left in his face at all. It made Rand think of a
Myrddraal.</p>

<p>By the time he looked back at Mat, Mat was on his
feet, his awkwardness unseen. Rand hastily hung his own saddlebags
and other bundles around him, trying to keep his cloak over the
sword as he did. Maybe Paitr already knew about it; maybe Gode had
told Ba&rsquo;alzamon, and Ba&rsquo;alzamon had told Paitr; but he did not
think so. He thought Paitr had only the vaguest idea of what had
happened in Four Kings. That was why he was so frightened.</p>

<p>The comparatively bright outline of the door helped
Mat make a beeline for it, if not quickly, then not slow enough to
seem unnatural, either. Rand followed closely, praying for him not
to stumble. He was thankful Mat had a clear, straight path, with no
tables or chairs in the way.</p>

<p>Behind him Paitr suddenly leaped to his feet. &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo;
he said desperately. &ldquo;You have to wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave us alone,&rdquo; Rand said without looking back.
They were almost to the door, and Mat had not put a foot wrong
yet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just listen to me,&rdquo; Paitr said, and put his hand on
Rand&rsquo;s shoulder to stop him.</p>

<p>Images spun in his head. The Trolloc, Narg, leaping
at him in his own home. The Myrddraal threatening at the Stag and
Lion in Baerlon. Halfmen everywhere, Fades chasing them to Shadar
Logoth, coming for them in Whitebridge. Darkfriends everywhere. He
whirled, his hand balling up. &ldquo;I said, leave us alone!&rdquo; His fist
took Paitr flush on the nose.</p>

<p>The Darkfriend fell on his bottom and sat there on
the floor staring at Rand. Blood trickled from his nose. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t
get away,&rdquo; he spat angrily. &ldquo;No matter how strong you are, the
Great Lord of the Dark is stronger. The Shadow will swallow
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a gasp from further into the common room,
and the clatter of a broom handle hitting the floor. The old man
with the broom had finally heard. He stood staring wide-eyed at
Paitr. The blood drained from his wrinkled face and his mouth
worked, but no sound came out. Paitr stared back for an instant,
then gave a wild curse and sprang to his feet, darting out of the
inn and down the street as if starving wolves were at his heels.
The old man shifted his attention to Rand and Mat, looking not a
whit less frightened.</p>

<p>Rand hustled Mat out of the inn and out of the
village as fast as he could, listening all the while for a hue and
cry that never came but was no less loud in his ears for that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blood and ashes,&rdquo; Mat growled, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re always
there, always right on our heels. We&rsquo;ll never get away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No they&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;If Ba&rsquo;alzamon knew we
were here, do you think he&rsquo;d have left it to that fellow? There&rsquo;d
have been another Gode, and twenty or thirty bullyboys. They&rsquo;re
still hunting, but they won&rsquo;t know until Paitr tells them, and
maybe he really is alone. He might have to go all the way to Four
Kings, for all we know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo; He was unsure which &ldquo;he&rdquo; Mat meant,
but it changed nothing. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to lie down and let them
take us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They got six rides, short ones, during the day. A
farmer told them that a crazy old man at the inn in Market Sheran
was claiming there were Darkfriends in the village. The farmer
could hardly talk for laughing; he kept wiping tears off his
cheeks. Darkfriends in Market Sheran! It was the best story he had
heard since Ackley Farren got drunk and spent the night on the inn
roof.</p>

<p>Another man, a round-faced wagonwright with tools
hanging from the sides of his cart and two wagon wheels in the
back, told a different story. Twenty Darkfriends had held a
gathering in Market Sheran. Men with twisted bodies, and the women
worse, all dirty and in rags. They could make your knees grow weak
and your stomach heave just by looking at you, and when they
laughed, the filthy cackles rang in your ears for hours and your
head felt as if it were splitting open. He had seen them himself,
just at a distance, far enough off to be safe. If the Queen would
not do something, then somebody ought to ask the Children of the
Light for help. Somebody should do something.</p>

<p>It was a relief when the wagonwright let them
down.</p>

<p>With the sun low behind them they walked into a small
village, much like Market Sheran. The Caemlyn Road split the town
neatly in two, but on both sides of the wide road stood rows of
small brick houses with thatched roofs. Webs of vine covered the
bricks, though only a few leaves hung on them. The village had one
inn, a small place no bigger than the Winespring Inn, with a sign
on a bracket out front, creaking back and forth in the wind, The
Queen&rsquo;s Man.</p>

<p>Strange, to think of the Winespring Inn as small.
Rand could remember when he thought it was about as big as a
building could be. Anything bigger would be a palace. But he had
seen a few things, now, and suddenly he realized that nothing would
look the same to him when he got back home. <em>If you ever
do</em>.</p>

<p>He hesitated in front of the inn, but even if prices
at The Queen&rsquo;s Man were not as high as in Market Sheran, they could
not afford a meal or a room, either one.</p>

<p>Mat saw where he was looking and patted the pocket
where he kept Thom&rsquo;s colored balls. &ldquo;I can see well enough, as long
as I don&rsquo;t try to get too fancy.&rdquo; His eyes had been getting better,
though he still wore the scarf around his forehead, and had
squinted whenever he looked at the sky during the day. When Rand
said nothing, Mat went on. &ldquo;There can&rsquo;t be Darkfriends at every inn
between here and Caemlyn. Besides, I don&rsquo;t want to sleep under a
bush if I can sleep in a bed.&rdquo; He made no move toward the inn,
though, just stood waiting for Rand.</p>

<p>After a moment Rand nodded. He felt as tired as he
had at any time since leaving home. Just thinking of a night in the
open made his bones ache. <em>It&rsquo;s all catching up. All the
running, all the looking over your shoulder</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t be everywhere,&rdquo; he agreed.</p>

<p>With the first step he took into the common room, he
wondered if he had made a mistake. It was a clean place, but
crowded. Every table was filled, and some men leaned against the
walls because there was nowhere for them to sit. From the way the
serving maids scurried between the tables with harried looks&mdash;and the landlord, too&mdash;it was a larger crowd than they were
used to. Too many for this small village. It was easy to pick out
the people who did not belong there. They were dressed no
differently from the rest, but they kept their eyes on their food
and drink. The locals watched the strangers as much as anything
else.</p>

<p>A drone of conversation hung in the air, enough that
the innkeeper took them into the kitchen when Rand made him
understand that they needed to talk to him. The noise was almost as
bad there, with the cook and his helpers banging pots and darting
about.</p>

<p>The innkeeper mopped his face with a large
handkerchief. &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re on your way to Caemlyn to see the
false Dragon like every other fool in the Realm. Well, it&rsquo;s six to
a room and two or three to a bed, and if that doesn&rsquo;t suit, I&rsquo;ve
nothing for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand gave his spiel with a feeling of queasiness.
With so many people on the road, every other one could be a
Darkfriend, and there was no way to pick them out from the rest.
Mat demonstrated his juggling&mdash;he kept it to three balls, and
was careful even then&mdash;and Rand took out Thom&rsquo;s flute. After
only a dozen notes of &ldquo;The Old Black Bear,&rdquo; the innkeeper nodded
impatiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do. I need something to take those idiots&rsquo;
minds off this Logain. There&rsquo;s been three fights already over
whether or not he&rsquo;s really the Dragon. Stow your things in the
corner, and I&rsquo;ll go clear a space for you. If there&rsquo;s any room to.
Fools. The world&rsquo;s full of fools who don&rsquo;t know enough to stay
where they belong. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s causing all the trouble. People
who won&rsquo;t stay where they belong.&rdquo; Mopping his face again, he
hurried out of the kitchen, muttering under his breath.</p>

<p>The cook and his helpers ignored Rand and Mat. Mat
kept adjusting the scarf around his head, pushing it up, then
blinking at the light and tugging it back down again. Rand wondered
if he could see well enough to do anything more complicated than
juggle three balls. As for himself&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The queasiness in his stomach grew thicker. He
dropped on a low stool, holding his head in his hands. The kitchen
felt cold. He shivered. Steam filled the air; stoves and ovens
crackled with heat. His shivers became stronger, his teeth
chattering. He wrapped his arms around himself, but it did no good.
His bones felt as if they were freezing.</p>

<p>Dimly he was aware of Mat asking him something,
shaking his shoulder, and of someone cursing and running out of the
room. Then the innkeeper was there, with the cook frowning at his
side, and Mat was arguing loudly with them both. He could not make
out any of what they said; the words were a buzz in his ears, and
he could not seem to think at all.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mat took his arm, pulling him to his feet.
All of their things&mdash;saddlebags, blanketrolls, Thom&rsquo;s bundled
cloak and instrument cases&mdash;hung from Mat&rsquo;s shoulders with
his bow. The innkeeper was watching them, wiping his face
anxiously. Weaving, more than half supported by Mat, Rand let his
friend steer him toward the back door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;S-s-sorry, M-m-mat,&rdquo; he managed. He could not stop
his teeth from chattering. &ldquo;M-m-must have&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;b-been t-the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;rain. O-one m-more night out&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;w-won&rsquo;t h-hurt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I guess.&rdquo;
Twilight darkened the sky, spotted by a handful of stars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; Mat said. He was trying to sound
cheerful, but Rand could hear the hidden worry. &ldquo;He was scared the
other folk would find out there was somebody sick in his inn. I
told him if he kicked us out, I&rsquo;d take you into the common room.
That&rsquo;d empty half his rooms in ten minutes. For all his talk about
fools, he doesn&rsquo;t want that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then w-where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; Mat said, pulling open the stable door with a
loud creak of hinges.</p>

<p>It was darker inside than out, and the air smelled of
hay and grain and horses, with a strong undersmell of manure. When
Mat lowered him to the straw-covered floor, he folded over with his
chest on his knees, still hugging himself and shaking from head to
toe. All of his strength seemed to go for the shaking. He heard Mat
stumble and curse and stumble again, then a clatter of metal.
Suddenly light blossomed. Mat held up a battered old lantern.</p>

<p>If the inn was full, so was its stable. Every stall
had a horse, some raising their heads and blinking at the light.
Mat eyed the ladder to the hayloft, then looked at Rand, crouched
on the floor, and shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never get you up there,&rdquo; Mat muttered. Hanging the
lantern on a nail, he scrambled up the ladder and began tossing
down armloads of hay. Hurriedly climbing back down, he made a bed
at the back of the stable and got Rand onto it. Mat covered him
with both their cloaks, but Rand pushed them off almost
immediately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hot,&rdquo; he murmured. Vaguely he knew that he had been
cold only a moment before, but now he felt as if he were in an
oven. He tugged at his collar, tossing his head. &ldquo;Hot.&rdquo; He felt
Mat&rsquo;s hand on his forehead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right back,&rdquo; Mat said, and disappeared.</p>

<p>He twisted fitfully on the hay, how long he was not
sure, until Mat returned with a heaped plate in one hand, a pitcher
in the other, and two white cups dangling from fingers by their
handles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no Wisdom here,&rdquo; he said, dropping to his
knees beside Rand. He filled one of the cups and held it to Rand&rsquo;s
mouth. Rand gulped the water down as if he had had nothing to drink
in days; that was how he felt. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t even know what a Wisdom
is. What they do have is somebody called Mother Brune, but she&rsquo;s
off somewhere birthing a baby, and nobody knows when she&rsquo;ll be
back. I did get some bread, and cheese, and sausage. Good Master
Inlow will give us anything as long as we stay out of sight of his
guests. Here, try some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand turned his head away from the food. The sight of
it, the thought of it, made his stomach heave. After a minute Mat
sighed and settled down to eat himself. Rand kept his eyes averted,
and tried not to listen.</p>

<p>The chills came once more, and then the fever, to be
replaced by the chills, and the fever again. Mat covered him when
he shook, and fed him water when he complained of thirst. The night
deepened, and the stable shifted in the flickering lantern light.
Shadows took shape and moved on their own. Then he saw Ba&rsquo;alzamon
striding down the stable, eyes burning, a Myrddraal at either side
with faces hidden in the depths of their black cowls.</p>

<p>Fingers scrabbling for his sword hilt, he tried to
get to his feet, yelling, &ldquo;Mat! Mat, they&rsquo;re here! Light, they&rsquo;re
here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat jerked awake where he sat cross-legged against
the wall. &ldquo;What? Darkfriends? Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wavering on his knees, Rand pointed frantically down
the stable&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and gaped. Shadows stirred, and a horse stamped in
its sleep. Nothing more. He fell back on the straw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nobody but us,&rdquo; Mat said. &ldquo;Here, let me take
that.&rdquo; He reached for Rand&rsquo;s sword belt, but Rand tightened his
grip on the hilt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. No. I have to keep it. He&rsquo;s my father. You
understand? He&rsquo;s m-my f-father!&rdquo; The shivering swept over him once
more, but he clung to the sword as if to a lifeline. &ldquo;M-my
f-father!&rdquo; Mat gave up trying to take it and pulled the cloaks back
over him.</p>

<p>There were other visitations in the night, while Mat
dozed. Rand was never sure if they were really there or not.
Sometimes he looked at Mat, with his head on his chest, wondering
if he would see them, too, if he woke.</p>

<p>Egwene stepped out of the shadows, her hair in a
long, dark braid as it had been in Emond&rsquo;s Field, her face pained
and mournful. &ldquo;Why did you leave us?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re dead
because you left us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shook his head weakly on the hay. &ldquo;No, Egwene. I
didn&rsquo;t want to leave you. Please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all dead,&rdquo; she said sadly, &ldquo;and death is the
kingdom of the Dark One. The Dark One has us, because you abandoned
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I had no choice, Egwene. Please. Egwene, don&rsquo;t
go. Come back, Egwene!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she turned into the shadows, and was shadow.</p>

<p>Moiraine&rsquo;s expression was serene, but her face was
bloodless and pale. Her cloak might as well have been a shroud, and
her voice was a lash. &ldquo;That is right, Rand al&rsquo;Thor. You have no
choice. You must go to Tar Valon, or the Dark One will take you for
his own. Eternity chained in the Shadow. Only Aes Sedai can save
you, now. Only Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom grinned at him sardonically. The gleeman&rsquo;s
clothes hung in charred rags that made him see the flashes of light
as Thom wrestled with the Fade to give them time to run. The flesh
under the rags was blackened and burned. &ldquo;Trust Aes Sedai, boy, and
you&rsquo;ll wish you were dead. Remember, the price of Aes Sedai help is
always smaller than you can believe, always greater than you can
imagine. And what Ajah will find you first, eh? Red? Maybe Black.
Best to run, boy. Run.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan&rsquo;s stare was as hard as granite, and blood covered
his face. &ldquo;Strange to see a heron-mark blade in the hands of a
sheepherder. Are you worthy of it? You had better be. You&rsquo;re alone,
now. Nothing to hold to behind you, and nothing before, and anyone
can be a Darkfriend.&rdquo; He smiled a wolf&rsquo;s smile, and blood poured
out of his mouth. &ldquo;Anyone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin came, accusing, pleading for help. Mistress
al&rsquo;Vere, weeping for her daughter, and Bayle Domon, cursing him for
bringing Fades down on his vessel, and Master Fitch, wringing his
hands over the ashes of his inn, and Min, screaming in a Trolloc&rsquo;s
clutches, people he knew, people he had only met. But the worst was
Tam. Tam stood over him, frowning and shaking his head, and said
not a word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have to tell me,&rdquo; Rand begged him. &ldquo;Who am I?
Tell me, please. Who am I? <em>Who am I?</em>&rdquo; he shouted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy, Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment he thought it was Tam answering, but
then he saw that Tam was gone. Mat bent over him, holding a cup of
water to his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just rest easy. You&rsquo;re Rand al&rsquo;Thor, that&rsquo;s who you
are, with the ugliest face and the thickest head in the Two Rivers.
Hey, you&rsquo;re sweating! The fever&rsquo;s broken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand al&rsquo;Thor?&rdquo; Rand whispered. Mat nodded, and there
was something so comforting in it that Rand drifted off to sleep
without even touching the water.</p>

<p>It was a sleep untroubled by dreams&mdash;at least
by any he remembered&mdash;but light enough that his eyes drifted
open whenever Mat checked on him. Once he wondered if Mat was
getting any sleep at all, but he fell back asleep himself before
the thought got very far.</p>

<p>The squeal of the door hinges roused him fully, but
for a moment he only lay there in the hay wishing he was still
asleep. Asleep he would not be aware of his body. His muscles ached
like wrung-out rags, and had about as much strength. Weakly he
tried to raise his head; he made it on the second try.</p>

<p>Mat sat in his accustomed place against the wall,
within arm&rsquo;s reach of Rand. His chin rested on his chest, which
rose and fell in the easy rhythm of deep sleep. The scarf had
slipped down over his eyes.</p>

<p>Rand looked toward the door.</p>

<p>A woman stood there holding it open with one hand.
For a moment she was only a dark shape in a dress, outlined by the
faint light of early morning, then she stepped inside, letting the
door swing shut behind her. In the lantern light he could see her
more clearly. She was about the same age as Nynaeve, he thought,
but she was no village woman. The pale green silk of her dress
shimmered as she moved. Her cloak was a rich, soft gray, and a
frothy net of lace caught up her hair. She fingered a heavy gold
necklace as she looked thoughtfully at Mat and him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat,&rdquo; Rand said, then louder, &ldquo;Mat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat snorted and almost fell over as he came awake.
Scrubbing sleep from his eyes, he stared at the woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came to look at my horse,&rdquo; she said, gesturing
vaguely at the stalls. She never took her eyes away from the two of
them, though. &ldquo;Are you ill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Mat said stiffly. &ldquo;He just caught a
chill in the rain, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I should look at him. I have some knowledge&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand wondered if she were Aes Sedai. Even more than
her clothes, her self-assured manner, the way she held her head as
if on the point of giving a command, did not belong here. <em>And
if she is Aes Sedai, of what Ajah?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, now,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;Really, there&rsquo;s no
need.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she came down the length of the stable, holding
her skirt up and placing her gray slippers gingerly. With a grimace
for the straw, she knelt beside him and felt his forehead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No fever,&rdquo; she said, studying him with a frown. She
was pretty, in a sharp-featured fashion, but there was no warmth in
her face. It was not cold, either; it just seemed to lack any
feeling whatsoever. &ldquo;You were sick, though. Yes. Yes. And still
weak as a day-old kitten. I think&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She reached under her
cloak, and suddenly things were happening too fast for Rand to do
more than give a strangled shout.</p>

<p>Her hand flashed from under her cloak; something
glittered as she lunged across Rand toward Mat. Mat toppled
sideways in a flurry of motion, and there was a solid <em>tchunk</em> of
metal driven into wood. It all took just an instant, and then
everything was still.</p>

<p>Mat lay half on his back, one hand gripping her wrist
just above the dagger she had driven into the wall where his chest
had been, his other hand holding the blade from Shadar Logoth to
her throat.</p>

<p>Moving nothing but her eyes, she tried to look down
at the dagger Mat held. Eyes widening, she drew a ragged breath and
tried to pull back from it, but he kept the edge against her skin.
After that, she was as still as a stone.</p>

<p>Licking his lips, Rand stared at the tableau above
him. Even if he had not been so weak, he did not believe he could
have moved. Then his eyes fell on her dagger, and his mouth went
dry. The wood around the blade was blackening; thin tendrils of
smoke rose from the char.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat! Mat, her dagger!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat flicked a glance at the dagger, then back to the
woman, but she had not moved. She was licking her lips nervously.
Roughly Mat pried her hand off the hilt and gave her a push; she
toppled back, sprawling away from them and catching herself with
her hands behind her, still watching the blade in his hand. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
move,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll use this if you move. Believe me, I will.&rdquo;
She nodded slowly; her eyes never left Mat&rsquo;s dagger. &ldquo;Watch her,
Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand was not sure what he was supposed to do if she
tried anything&mdash;shout, maybe; he certainly could not run
after her if she tried to flee&mdash;but she sat there without
twitching while Mat yanked her dagger free of the wall. The black
spot stopped growing, though a faint wisp of smoke still trailed up
from it.</p>

<p>Mat looked around for somewhere to put the dagger,
then thrust it toward Rand. He took it gingerly, as if it were a
live adder. It looked ordinary, if ornate, with a pale ivory hilt
and a narrow, gleaming blade no longer than the palm of his hand.
Just a dagger. Only he had seen what it could do. The hilt was not
even warm, but his hand began to sweat. He hoped he did not drop it
in the hay.</p>

<p>The woman did not move from her sprawl as she watched
Mat slowly turn toward her. She watched him as if wondering what he
would do next, but Rand saw the sudden tightening of Mat&rsquo;s eyes,
the tightening of his hand on the dagger. &ldquo;Mat, no!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She tried to kill me, Rand. She&rsquo;d have killed you,
too. She&rsquo;s a Darkfriend.&rdquo; Mat spat the word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; Rand said. The woman gasped as if
she had just realized what Mat had intended. &ldquo;We are not, Mat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Mat remained frozen, the blade in his
fist catching the lantern light. Then he nodded. &ldquo;Move over there,&rdquo;
he told the woman, gesturing with the dagger toward the door to the
tack room.</p>

<p>She got to her feet slowly, pausing to brush the
straw from her dress. Even when she started in the direction Mat
indicated, she moved as if there were no reason to hurry. But Rand
noticed that she kept a wary eye on the ruby-hilted dagger in Mat&rsquo;s
hand. &ldquo;You really should stop struggling,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It would be
for the best, in the end. You will see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The best?&rdquo; Mat said wryly, rubbing his chest where
her blade would have gone if he had not moved. &ldquo;Get over there.
&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave a casual shrug as she obeyed. &ldquo;A mistake.
There has been considerable&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;confusion since what happened
with that egotistical fool Gode. Not to mention whoever the idiot
was who started the panic in Market Sheran. No one is sure what
happened there, or how. That makes it more dangerous for you, don&rsquo;t
you see? You will have honored places if you come to the Great Lord
of your own free will, but as long as you run, there will be
pursuit, and who can tell what will happen then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand felt a chill. <em>My hounds are jealous, and may
not be gentle</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re having trouble with a couple of farmboys.&rdquo;
Mat&rsquo;s laugh was grim. &ldquo;Maybe you Darkfriends aren&rsquo;t as dangerous as
I&rsquo;ve always heard.&rdquo; He flung open the door of the tack room and
stepped back.</p>

<p>She paused just through the doorway, looking at him
over her shoulder. Her gaze was ice, and her voice colder still.
&ldquo;You will find out how dangerous we are. When the Myrddraal gets
here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whatever else she had to say was cut off as Mat
slammed the door and pulled the bar down into its brackets. When he
turned, his eyes were worried. &ldquo;Fade,&rdquo; he said in a tight voice,
tucking the dagger back under his coat. &ldquo;Coming here, she says. How
are your legs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t dance,&rdquo; Rand muttered, &ldquo;but if you&rsquo;ll help
me get on my feet, I can walk.&rdquo; He looked at the blade in his hand
and shuddered. &ldquo;Blood and ashes, I&rsquo;ll run.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hurriedly hanging himself about with their
possessions, Mat pulled Rand to his feet. Rand&rsquo;s legs wobbled, and
he had to lean on his friend to stay upright, but he tried not to
slow Mat down. He held the woman&rsquo;s dagger well away from himself.
Outside the door was a bucket of water. He tossed the dagger into
it as they passed. The blade entered the water with a hiss; steam
rose from the surface. Grimacing, he tried to take faster
steps.</p>

<p>With light come, there were plenty of people in the
streets, even so early. They were about their own business, though,
and no one had any attention to spare for two young men walking out
of the village, not with so many strangers about. Just the same,
Rand stiffened every muscle, trying to stand straight. With each
step he wondered if any of the folk hurrying by were Darkfriends.
<em>Are any of them waiting for the woman with the dagger? For the
Fade?</em></p>

<p>A mile outside the village his strength gave out. One
minute he was panting along, hanging on Mat; the next they were
both on the ground. Mat tugged him over to the side of the
road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have to keep going,&rdquo; Mat said. He scrubbed his
hand through his hair, then tugged the scarf down above his eyes.
&ldquo;Sooner or later, somebody will let her out, and they&rsquo;ll be after
us again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Rand panted. &ldquo;I know. Give me a hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat pulled him up again, but he wavered there,
knowing it was no good. The first time he tried to take a step, he
would be flat on his face again.</p>

<p>Holding him upright, Mat waited impatiently for a
horse-cart, approaching from the village, to pass them. Mat gave a
grunt of surprise when the cart slowed to a stop before them. A
leathery-faced man looked down from the driver&rsquo;s seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something wrong with him?&rdquo; the man asked around his
pipe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just tired,&rdquo; Mat said.</p>

<p>Rand could see that was not going to do, not leaning
on Mat the way he was. He let go of Mat and took a step away from
him. His legs quivered, but he willed himself to stay erect. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t slept in two days,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Ate something that made me
sick. I&rsquo;m better, now, but I haven&rsquo;t slept.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man blew a streamer of smoke from the corner of
his mouth. &ldquo;Going to Caemlyn, are you? Was your age, I expect I
might be off to see this false Dragon myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Mat nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. We&rsquo;re going to see
the false Dragon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, climb on up, then. Your friend in the back. If
he&rsquo;s sick again, best it&rsquo;s on the straw, not up here. Name&rsquo;s Hyam
Kinch.&rdquo;</p>
