<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t
seemed to Rand that he was sitting at table with
Logain and Moiraine. The Aes Sedai and the false Dragon sat
watching him silently, as if neither knew the other was there.
Abruptly he realized the walls of the room were becoming
indistinct, fading off into gray. A sense of urgency built in him.
Everything was going, blurring away. When he looked back to the
table, Moiraine and Logain had vanished, and Ba&rsquo;alzamon sat there
instead. Rand&rsquo;s whole body vibrated with urgency; it hummed inside
his head, louder and louder. The hum became the pounding of blood
in his ears.</p>

<p>With a jerk he sat up, and immediately groaned and
clutched his head, swaying. His whole skull hurt; his left hand
found sticky dampness in his hair. He was sitting on the ground, on
green grass. That troubled him, vaguely, but his head spun and
everything he looked at lurched, and all he could think of was
lying down until it stopped.</p>

<p><em>The wall! The girl&rsquo;s voice!</em></p>

<p>Steadying himself with one hand flat on the grass, he
looked around slowly. He had to do it slowly; when he tried to turn
his head quickly everything started whirling again. He was in a
garden, or a park; a slate-paved walk meandered by through
flowering bushes not six feet away, with a white stone bench beside
it and a leafy arbor over the bench for shade. He had fallen inside
the wall. <em>And the girl?</em></p>

<p>He found the tree, close behind his back, and found
her, too&mdash;climbing down out of it. She reached the ground and turned
to face him, and he blinked and groaned again. A deep blue velvet
cloak lined with pale fur rested on her shoulders, its hood hanging
down behind to her waist with a cluster of silver bells at the
peak. They jingled when she moved. A silver filigree circlet held
her long, red-gold curls, and delicate silver rings hung at her
ears, while a necklace of heavy silver links and dark green stones
he thought were emeralds lay around her throat. Her pale blue dress
was smudged with bark stains from her tree climbing, but it was
still silk, and embroidered with painstakingly intricate designs,
the skirt slashed with inserts the color of rich cream. A wide belt
of woven silver encircled her waist, and velvet slippers peeked
from under the hem of her dress.</p>

<p>He had only ever seen two women dressed in this
fashion, Moiraine and the Darkfriend who had tried to kill Mat and
him. He could not begin to imagine who would choose to climb trees
in clothes like that, but he was sure she had to be someone
important. The way she was looking at him redoubled the impression.
She did not seem in the least troubled at having a stranger tumble
into her garden. There was a self-possession about her that made
him think of Nynaeve, or Moiraine.</p>

<p>He was so enmeshed in worrying whether or not he had
gotten himself into trouble, whether or not she was someone who
could and would call the Queen&rsquo;s Guards even on a day when they had
other things to occupy them, that it took him a few moments to see
past the elaborate clothes and lofty attitude to the girl herself.
She was perhaps two or three years younger than he, tall for a
girl, and beautiful, her face a perfect oval framed by that mass of
sunburst curls, her lips full and red, her eyes bluer than he could
believe. She was completely different from Egwene in height and
face and body, but every bit as beautiful. He felt a twinge of
guilt, but told himself that denying what his eyes saw would not
bring Egwene safely to Caemlyn one whit faster.</p>

<p>A scrabbling sound came from up in the tree and bits
of bark fell, followed by a boy dropping lightly to the ground
behind her. He was a head taller than she and a little older, but
his face and hair marked him as her close kin. His coat and cloak
were red and white and gold, embroidered and brocaded, and for a
male even more ornate than hers. That increased Rand&rsquo;s anxiety.
Only on a feastday would any ordinary man dress in anything like
that, and never with that much grandeur. This was no public park.
Perhaps the Guards were too busy to bother with trespassers.</p>

<p>The boy studied Rand over the girl&rsquo;s shoulder,
fingering the dagger at his waist. It seemed more a nervous habit
than any thought that he might use it. Not completely, though. The
boy had the same self-possession as the girl, and they both looked
at him as if he were a puzzle to be solved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will never hear the end of this, Elayne, if
mother finds out,&rdquo; the boy said suddenly. &ldquo;She told us to stay in
our rooms, but you just had to get a look at Logain, didn&rsquo;t you?
Now look what it has got us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, Gawyn.&rdquo; She was clearly the younger of the
two, but she spoke as though she took it for granted that he would
obey. The boy&rsquo;s face struggled as if he had more to say, but to
Rand&rsquo;s surprise he held his peace. &ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; she said
suddenly.</p>

<p>It took Rand a minute to realize she was speaking to
him. When he did, he tried to struggle to his feet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. I
just&mdash;&rdquo; He tottered, and his legs gave way. He sat back down
hard. His head swam. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just climb back over the wall,&rdquo; he
muttered. He attempted to stand again, but she put a hand on his
shoulder, pressing him down. He was so dizzy the slight pressure
was enough to hold him in place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You <em>are</em> hurt.&rdquo; Gracefully she knelt beside
him. Her fingers gently parted the blood-matted hair on the left
side of his head. &ldquo;You must have struck a branch coming down. You
will be lucky if you didn&rsquo;t break anything more than your scalp. I
don&rsquo;t think I ever saw anyone as skillful at climbing as you, but
you don&rsquo;t do so well falling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get blood on your hands,&rdquo; he said drawing
back.</p>

<p>Firmly she pulled his head back to where she could
get at it. &ldquo;Hold still.&rdquo; She did not speak sharply, but again there
was that note in her voice as if she expected to be obeyed. &ldquo;It
does not look <em>too</em> bad, thank the Light.&rdquo; From pockets on
the inside of her cloak she began taking out an array of tiny vials
and twisted packets of paper, finishing with a handful of wadded
bandage.</p>

<p>He stared at the collection in amazement. It was the
sort of thing he would have expected a Wisdom to carry, not someone
dressed as she was. She had gotten blood on her fingers, he saw,
but it didn&rsquo;t seem to bother her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me your water flask, Gawyn,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I need
to wash this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy she called Gawyn unfastened a leather bottle
from his belt and handed it to her, then squatted easily at Rand&rsquo;s
feet with his arms folded on his knees. Elayne went about what she
was doing in a very workmanlike manner. He did not flinch at the
sting of the cold water when she washed the cut on his scalp, but
she held the top of his head as if she expected him to try to pull
away again and would have none of it. The ointment she smoothed on
after, from one of her small vials, soothed almost as much as one
of Nynaeve&rsquo;s preparations would have.</p>

<p>Gawyn smiled as she worked, a calming smile, as if
he, too, expected Rand to jerk away and maybe even run. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
always finding stray cats and birds with broken wings. You are the
first human being she has had to work on.&rdquo; He hesitated, then
added, &ldquo;Do not be offended. I am not calling you a stray.&rdquo; It was
not an apology, just a statement of fact.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No offense taken,&rdquo; Rand said stiffly. But the pair
were acting as if he were a skittish horse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She does know what she is doing,&rdquo; Gawyn said. &ldquo;She
has had the best teachers. So do not fear, you are in good
hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne pressed some of the bandaging against his
temple and pulled a silk scarf from her belt, blue and cream and
gold. For any girl in Emond&rsquo;s Field it would have been a treasured
feast-day cloth. Elayne deftly began winding it around his head to
hold the wad of bandage in place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t use that,&rdquo; he protested.</p>

<p>She went on winding. &ldquo;I told you to hold still,&rdquo; she
said calmly.</p>

<p>Rand looked at Gawyn. &ldquo;Does she always expect
everybody to do what she tells them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A flash of surprise crossed the young man&rsquo;s face, and
his mouth tightened with amusement. &ldquo;Most of the time she does. And
most of the time they do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold this,&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;Put your hand there while
I tie&mdash;&rdquo; She exclaimed at the sight of his hands. &ldquo;You did not
do this falling. Climbing where you shouldn&rsquo;t have been climbing is
more like it.&rdquo; Quickly finishing her knot, she turned his hands
palms upward in front of him, muttering to herself about how little
water was left. The water made the lacerations burn, but her touch
was surprisingly delicate. &ldquo;Hold still, this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The vial of ointment was produced again. She spread
it thinly across the scrapes, all of her attention apparently on
rubbing it in without hurting him. A coolness spread through his
hands, as if she were rubbing the torn places away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most of the time they do exactly what she says,&rdquo;
Gawyn went on with an affectionate grin at the top of her head.
&ldquo;Most people. Not Mother, of course. Or Elaida. And not Lini. Lini
was her nurse. You can&rsquo;t give orders to someone who switched you
for stealing figs when you were little. And even not so little.&rdquo;
Elayne raised her head long enough to give him a dangerous look. He
cleared his throat and carefully blanked his expression before
hurrying on. &ldquo;And Gareth, of course. No one gives orders to
Gareth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not even Mother,&rdquo; Elayne said, bending her head back
over Rand&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;She makes suggestions, and he always does what
she suggests, but I&rsquo;ve never heard her give him a command.&rdquo; She
shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why that always surprises you,&rdquo; Gawyn
answered her. &ldquo;Even you don&rsquo;t try telling Gareth what to do. He&rsquo;s
served three Queens and been Captain-General, and First Prince
Regent, for two. I daresay there are some think he&rsquo;s more a symbol
of the Throne of Andor than the Queen is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother should go ahead and marry him,&rdquo; she said
absently. Her attention was on Rand&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;She wants to; she
can&rsquo;t hide it from me. And it would solve so many problems.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gawyn shook his head. &ldquo;One of them must bend first.
Mother cannot, and Gareth will not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she commanded him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He would obey, I think. But she won&rsquo;t. You know she
won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly they turned to stare at Rand. He had the
feeling they had forgotten he was there. &ldquo;Who&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; He had to
stop to wet his lips. &ldquo;Who is your mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s eyes widened in surprise, but Gawyn spoke in
an ordinary tone that made his words all the more jarring.
&ldquo;Morgase, by the Grace of the Light, Queen of Andor, Protector of
the Realm, Defender of the People, High Seat of the House
Trakand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Queen,&rdquo; Rand muttered, shock spreading through
him in waves of numbness. For a minute he thought his head was
going to begin spinning again. <em>Don&rsquo;t attract any attention.
Just fall into the Queen&rsquo;s garden and let the Daughter-Heir tend
your cuts like a hedge-doctor</em>. He wanted to laugh, and knew it
for the fringes of panic.</p>

<p>Drawing a deep breath, he scrambled hastily to his
feet. He held himself tightly in rein against the urge to run, but
the need to get away filled him, to get away before anyone else
discovered him there.</p>

<p>Elayne and Gawyn watched him calmly, and when he
leaped up they rose gracefully, not hurried in the least. He put up
a hand to pull the scarf from his head, and Elayne seized his
elbow. &ldquo;Stop that. You will start the bleeding again.&rdquo; Her voice
was still calm, still sure that he would do as he was told.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to go,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just climb back over
the wall and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You really didn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; For the first time she
seemed as startled as he was. &ldquo;Do you mean you climbed up on that
wall to see Logain without even knowing where you were? You could
have gotten a much better view down in the streets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t like crowds,&rdquo; he mumbled. He
sketched a bow to each of them. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll pardon me, ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;my
Lady.&rdquo; In the stories, royal courts were full of people all calling
one another Lord and Lady and Royal Highness and Majesty, but if he
had ever heard the correct form of address for the Daughter-Heir,
he could not think clearly enough to remember. He could not think
clearly about anything beyond the need to be far away. &ldquo;If you will
pardon me, I&rsquo;ll just leave now. Ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;thank you for the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;
He touched the scarf around his head. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without even telling us your name?&rdquo; Gawyn said. &ldquo;A
poor payment for Elayne&rsquo;s care. I&rsquo;ve been wondering about you. You
sound like an Andorman, though not a Caemlyner, certainly, but you
look like&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Well, you know our names. Courtesy would suggest
you give us yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Looking longingly at the wall, Rand gave his right
name before he thought what he was doing, and even added, &ldquo;From
Emond&rsquo;s Field, in the Two Rivers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From the west,&rdquo; Gawyn murmured. &ldquo;Very far to the
west.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand looked around at him sharply. There had been a
note of surprise in the young man&rsquo;s voice, and Rand caught some of
it still on his face when he turned. Gawyn replaced it with a
pleasant smile so quickly, though, that he almost doubted what he
had seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tabac and wool,&rdquo; Gawyn said. &ldquo;I have to know the
principal products of every part of the Realm. Of every land, for
that matter. Part of my training. Principal products and crafts,
and what the people are like. Their customs, their strengths and
weaknesses. It&rsquo;s said Two Rivers people are stubborn. They can be
led, if they think you are worthy, but the harder you try to push
them, the harder they dig in. Elayne ought to choose her husband
from there. It&rsquo;ll take a man with a will like stone to keep from
being trampled by her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stared at him. Elayne was staring, too. Gawyn
looked as much under control as ever, but he was babbling.
<em>Why?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>All three of them jumped at the sudden voice, and
spun to face it.</p>

<p>The young man who stood there was the handsomest man
Rand had ever seen, almost too handsome for masculinity. He was
tall and slender, but his movements spoke of whipcord strength and
a sure confidence. Dark of hair and eye, he wore his clothes, only
a little less elaborate in red and white than Gawyn&rsquo;s, as if they
were of no importance. One hand rested on his sword hilt, and his
eyes were steady on Rand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand away from him, Elayne,&rdquo; the man said. &ldquo;You,
too, Gawyn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne stepped in front of Rand, between him and the
newcomer, head high and as confident as ever. &ldquo;He is a loyal
subject of our mother, and a good Queen&rsquo;s man. And he is under my
protection, Galad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand tried to remember what he had heard from Master
Kinch, and since from Master Gill. Galadedrid Damodred was Elayne&rsquo;s
half-brother, Elayne&rsquo;s and Gawyn&rsquo;s, if he remembered correctly; the
three shared the same father. Master Kinch might not have liked
Taringail Damodred too well&mdash;neither did anyone else that he
had heard&mdash;but the son was well thought of by wearers of the
red and the white alike, if talk in the city was any guide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am aware of your fondness for strays, Elayne,&rdquo; the
slender man said reasonably, &ldquo;but the fellow is armed, and he
hardly looks reputable. In these days, we cannot be too careful. If
he&rsquo;s a loyal Queen&rsquo;s man, what is he doing here where he does not
belong? It is easy enough to change the wrappings on a sword,
Elayne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is here as my guest, Galad, and I vouch for him.
Or have you appointed yourself my nurse, to decide whom I may talk
to, and when?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her voice was rich with scorn, but Galad seemed
unmoved. &ldquo;You know I make no claims for control over your actions,
Elayne, but this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;guest of yours is not proper, and you know
that as well as I. Gawyn, help me convince her. Our mother would&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; Elayne snapped. &ldquo;You are right that you
have no say over my actions, nor have you any right to judge them.
You may leave me. Now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Galad gave Gawyn a rueful look; at one and the same
time it seemed to ask for help while saying that Elayne was too
headstrong to be helped. Elayne&rsquo;s face darkened, but just as she
opened her mouth again, he bowed, in all formality yet with the
grace of a cat, took a step back, then turned and strode down the
paved path, his long legs carrying him quickly out of sight beyond
the arbor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hate him,&rdquo; Elayne breathed. &ldquo;He is vile and full
of envy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you go too far, Elayne,&rdquo; Gawyn said. &ldquo;Galad
does not know the meaning of envy. Twice he has saved my life, with
none to know if he held his hand. If he had not, he would be your
First Prince of the Sword in my place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never, Gawyn. I would choose anyone before Galad.
Anyone. The lowest stableboy.&rdquo; Suddenly she smiled and gave her
brother a mock-stern look. &ldquo;You say I am fond of giving orders.
Well, I command you to let nothing happen to you. I command you to
be my First Prince of the Sword when I take the throne&mdash;the
Light send that day is far off!&mdash;and to lead the armies of
Andor with the sort of honor Galad cannot dream of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you command, my Lady.&rdquo; Gawyn laughed, his bow a
parody of Galad&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Elayne gave Rand a thoughtful frown. &ldquo;Now we must get
you out of here quickly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Galad always does the right thing,&rdquo; Gawyn explained,
&ldquo;even when he should not. In this case, finding a stranger in the
gardens, the right thing is to notify the Palace guards. Which I
suspect he is on his way to do right this minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s time I was back over the wall,&rdquo; Rand said.
<em>A fine day for going unnoticed! I might as well carry a
sign!</em> He turned to the wall, but Elayne caught his arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not after the trouble I went to with your hands.
You&rsquo;ll only make fresh scrapes and then let some back-alley crone
put the Light knows what on them. There is a small gate on the
other side of the garden. It&rsquo;s overgrown, and no one but me even
remembers it&rsquo;s there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly Rand heard boots pounding toward them over
the slate paving stones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too late,&rdquo; Gawyn muttered. &ldquo;He must have started
running as soon as he was out of eyeshot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne growled an oath, and Rand&rsquo;s eyebrows shot up.
He had heard that one from the stablemen at The Queen&rsquo;s Blessing
and had been shocked then. The next moment she was in cool
self-possession once more.</p>

<p>Gawyn and Elayne appeared content to remain where
they were, but he could not make himself stay for the Queen&rsquo;s
Guards with such equanimity. He started once more for the wall,
knowing he would be no more than halfway up before the guards
arrived, but unable to stand still.</p>

<p>Before he had taken three steps red-uniformed men
burst into sight, breastplates catching the sun as they dashed up
the path. Others came like breaking waves of scarlet and polished
steel, seemingly from every direction. Some held drawn swords;
others only waited to set their boots before raising bows and
nocking feathered shafts. Behind the barred face-guards every eye
was grim, and every broadhead arrow was pointed unwaveringly at
him.</p>

<p>Elayne and Gawyn leaped as one, putting themselves
between him and the arrows, their arms spread to cover him. He
stood very still and kept his hands in plain sight, away from his
sword.</p>

<p>While the thud of boots and the creak of bowstrings
still hung in the air, one of the soldiers, with the golden knot of
an officer on his shoulder, shouted, &ldquo;My Lady, my Lord, down,
quickly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite her outstretched arms Elayne drew herself up
regally. &ldquo;You dare to bring bare steel into my presence, Tallanvor?
Gareth Bryne will have you mucking stables with the meanest trooper
for this, if you are lucky!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The soldiers exchanged puzzled glances, and some of
the bowmen uneasily half lowered their bows. Only then did Elayne
let her arms down, as if she had only held them up because she
wished to. Gawyn hesitated, then followed her example. Rand could
count the bows that had not been lowered. The muscles of his
stomach tensed as though they could stop a broadhead shaft at
twenty paces.</p>

<p>The man with the officer&rsquo;s knot seemed the most
perplexed of all. &ldquo;My Lady, forgive me, but Lord Galadedrid
reported a dirty peasant skulking in the gardens, armed and
endangering my Lady Elayne and my Lord Gawyn.&rdquo; His eyes went to
Rand, and his voice firmed. &ldquo;If my Lady and my Lord will please to
step aside, I will take the villain into custody. There is too much
riff-raff in the city these days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt very much if Galad reported anything of the
kind,&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;Galad does not lie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I wish he would,&rdquo; Gawyn said softly, for
Rand&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;Just once. It might make living with him easier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This man is my guest,&rdquo; Elayne continued, &ldquo;and here
under my protection. You may withdraw, Tallanvor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I regret that will not be possible, My Lady. As My
Lady knows, the Queen, your lady mother, has given orders regarding
anyone on Palace grounds without Her Majesty&rsquo;s permission, and word
has been sent to Her Majesty of this intruder.&rdquo; There was more than
a hint of satisfaction in Tallanvor&rsquo;s voice. Rand suspected the
officer had had to accept other commands from Elayne that he did
not think proper; this time the man was not about to, not when he
had a perfect excuse.</p>

<p>Elayne stared back at Tallanvor; for once she seemed
at a loss.</p>

<p>Rand looked a question at Gawyn, and Gawyn
understood. &ldquo;Prison,&rdquo; he murmured. Rand&rsquo;s face went white, and the
young man added quickly, &ldquo;Only for a few days, and you will not be
harmed. You&rsquo;ll be questioned by Gareth Bryne, the Captain-General,
personally, but you will be set free once it&rsquo;s clear you meant no
harm.&rdquo; He paused, hidden thoughts in his eyes. &ldquo;I hope you were
telling the truth, Rand al&rsquo;Thor from the Two Rivers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will conduct all three of us to my mother,&rdquo;
Elayne announced suddenly. A grin bloomed on Gawyn&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>Behind the steel bars across his face, Tallanvor
appeared taken aback. &ldquo;My Lady, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or else conduct all three of us to a cell,&rdquo; Elayne
said. &ldquo;We will remain together. Or will you give orders for hands
to be laid upon my person?&rdquo; Her smile was victorious, and the way
Tallanvor looked around as if he expected to find help in the trees
said he, too, thought she had won.</p>

<p><em>Won what? How?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother is viewing Logain,&rdquo; Gawyn said softly, as if
he had read Rand&rsquo;s thoughts, &ldquo;and even if she was not busy,
Tallanvor would not dare troop into her presence with Elayne and
me, as if we were under guard. Mother has a bit of a temper,
sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand remembered what Master Gill had said about Queen
Morgase. <em>A bit of a temper?</em></p>

<p>Another red-uniformed soldier came running down the
path, skidding to a halt to salute with an arm across his chest. He
spoke softly to Tallanvor, and his words brought satisfaction back
to Tallanvor&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Queen, your lady mother,&rdquo; Tallanvor announced,
&ldquo;commands me to bring the intruder to her immediately. It is also
the Queen&rsquo;s command that my Lady Elayne and my Lord Gawyn attend
her. Also immediately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gawyn winced, and Elayne swallowed hard. Her face
composed, she still began industriously brushing at the stains on
her dress. Aside from dislodging a few pieces of bark, her effort
did little good.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If My Lady pleases?&rdquo; Tallanvor said smugly. &ldquo;My
Lord?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The soldiers formed around them in a hollow box that
started along the slate path with Tallanvor leading. Gawyn and
Elayne walked on either side of Rand, both appearing lost in
unpleasant thoughts. The soldiers had sheathed their swords and
returned arrows to quivers, but they were no less on guard than
when they had had weapons in hand. They watched Rand as if they
expected him at any moment to snatch his sword and try to cut his
way to freedom.</p>

<p><em>Try anything? I won&rsquo;t try</em> anything.
<em>Unnoticed! Hah!</em></p>

<p>Watching the soldiers watching him, he suddenly
became aware of the garden. He had regained his balance completely
since the fall. One thing had happened after another, each new
shock coming before the last had a chance to fade, and his
surroundings had been a blur, except for the wall and his devout
wish to be back on the other side of it. Now he saw the green grass
that had only tickled the back of his mind before. <em>Green!</em>
A hundred shades of green. Trees and bushes green and thriving,
thick with leaves and fruit. Lush vines covering arbors over the
path. Flowers everywhere. So many flowers, spraying the garden with
color. Some he knew&mdash;bright golden sunburst and tiny pink tallowend,
crimson starblaze and purple Emond&rsquo;s Glory, roses in every color
from purest white to deep, deep red&mdash;but others were strange,
so fanciful in shape and hue he wondered if they could be real.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s green,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Green.&rdquo; The soldiers
muttered to themselves; Tallanvor gave them a sharp look over his
shoulder and they fell silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elaida&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; Gawyn said absently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not right,&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;She asked if I
wanted to pick out the one farm she could do the same for, while
all around it the crops still failed, but it still isn&rsquo;t right for
us to have flowers when there are people who do not have enough to
eat.&rdquo; She drew a deep breath, and refilled her self-possession.
&ldquo;Remember yourself,&rdquo; she told Rand briskly. &ldquo;Speak up clearly when
you are spoken to, and keep silent otherwise. And follow my lead.
All will be well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand wished he could share her confidence. It would
have helped if Gawyn had seemed to have it as well. As Tallanvor
led them into the Palace, he looked back at the garden, at all the
green streaked with blossoms, colors wrought for a Queen by an Aes
Sedai&rsquo;s hand. He was in deep water, and there was no bank in
sight.</p>

<p>Palace servants filled the halls, in red liveries
with collars and cuffs of white, the White Lion on the left breast
of their tunics, scurrying about intent on tasks that were not
readily apparent. When the soldiers trooped by with Elayne and
Gawyn, and Rand, in their midst, they stopped dead in their tracks
to stare openmouthed.</p>

<p>Through the middle of all the consternation a
gray-striped tomcat wandered unconcernedly down the hall, weaving
between the goggling servants. Suddenly the cat struck Rand as odd.
He had been in Baerlon long enough to know that even the meanest
shop had cats lurking in every corner. Since entering the Palace,
the tom was the only cat he had seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have rats?&rdquo; he said in disbelief.
<em>Every</em> place had rats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elaida doesn&rsquo;t like rats,&rdquo; Gawyn muttered vaguely.
He was frowning worriedly down the hall, apparently already seeing
the coming meeting with the Queen. &ldquo;We never have rats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Both of you be quiet.&rdquo; Elayne&rsquo;s voice was sharp, but
as absent as her brother&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I am trying to think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand watched the cat over his shoulder until the
guards took him round a corner, hiding the tom from sight. A lot of
cats would have made him feel better; it would have been nice if
there was one thing normal about the Palace, even if it was
rats.</p>

<p>The path Tallanvor took turned so many times that
Rand lost his sense of direction. Finally the young officer stopped
before tall double doors of dark wood with a rich glow, not so
grand as some they had passed, but still carved all over with rows
of lions, finely wrought in detail. A liveried servant stood to
either side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least it isn&rsquo;t the Grand Hall.&rdquo; Gawyn laughed
unsteadily. &ldquo;I never heard that Mother commanded anyone&rsquo;s head cut
off from here.&rdquo; He sounded as if he thought she might set a
precedent.</p>

<p>Tallanvor reached for Rand&rsquo;s sword, but Elayne moved
to cut him off. &ldquo;He is my guest, and by custom and law, guests of
the royal family may go armed even in Mother&rsquo;s presence. Or will
you deny my word that he is my guest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tallanvor hesitated, locking eyes with her, then
nodded. &ldquo;Very well, my Lady.&rdquo; She smiled at Rand as Tallanvor
stepped back, but it lasted only a moment. &ldquo;First rank to accompany
me,&rdquo; Tallanvor commanded. &ldquo;Announce the Lady Elayne and the Lord
Gawyn to Her Majesty,&rdquo; he told the doorkeepers. &ldquo;Also
Guardsman-Lieutenant Tallanvor, at Her Majesty&rsquo;s command, with the
intruder under guard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne scowled at Tallanvor, but the doors were
already swinging open. A sonorous voice sounded, announcing those
who came.</p>

<p>Grandly Elayne swept through the doors, spoiling her
regal entrance only a little by motioning for Rand to keep close
behind her. Gawyn squared his shoulders and strode in flanking her,
one measured pace to her rear. Rand followed, uncertainly keeping
level with Gawyn on her other side. Tallanvor stayed close to Rand,
and ten soldiers came with him. The doors closed silently behind
them.</p>

<p>Suddenly Elayne dropped into a deep curtsy,
simultaneously bowing from the waist, and stayed there, holding her
skirt wide. Rand gave a start, then hastily emulated Gawyn and the
other men, shifting awkwardly until he had it right. Down on his
right knee, head bowed, bending forward to press the knuckles of
his right hand against the marble tiles, his left hand resting on
the end of his sword hilt. Gawyn, without a sword, put his hand on
his dagger the same way.</p>

<p>Rand was just congratulating himself on getting it
right when he noticed Tallanvor, his head still bent, glaring
sideways at him from behind his face-guard. <em>Was I supposed to
do something else?</em> He was suddenly angry that Tallanvor
expected him to know what to do when no one had told him. And angry
over being afraid of the guards. He had done nothing to be fearful
for. He knew his fear was not Tallanvor&rsquo;s fault, but he was angry
at him anyway.</p>

<p>Everyone held their positions, frozen as if waiting
for the spring thaw. He did not know what they were waiting for,
but he took the opportunity to study the place to which he had been
brought. He kept his head down, just turning it enough to see.
Tallanvor&rsquo;s scowl deepened, but he ignored it.</p>

<p>The square chamber was about the size of the common
room at The Queen&rsquo;s Blessing, its walls presenting hunting scenes
carved in relief in stone of the purest white. The tapestries
between the carvings were gentle images of bright flowers and
brilliantly plumaged hummingbirds, except for the two at the far
end of the room, where the White Lion of Andor stood taller than a
man on scarlet fields. Those two hangings flanked a dais, and on
the dais a carved and gilded throne where sat the Queen.</p>

<p>A bluff, blocky man stood bareheaded by the Queen&rsquo;s
right hand in the red of the Queen&rsquo;s Guards, with four golden knots
on the shoulder of his cloak and wide golden bands breaking the
white of his cuffs. His temples were heavy with gray, but he looked
as strong and immovable as a rock. That had to be the
Captain-General, Gareth Bryne. Behind the throne and to the other
side a woman in deep green silk sat on a low stool, knitting
something out of dark, almost black, wool. At first the knitting
made Rand think she was old, but at second glance he could not put
an age to her at all. Young, old, he did not know. Her attention
seemed to be entirely on her needles and yarn, just as if there
were not a Queen within arm&rsquo;s reach of her. She was a handsome
woman, outwardly placid, yet there was something terrible in her
concentration. There was no sound in the room except for the click
of her needles.</p>

<p>He tried to look at everything, yet his eyes kept
going back to the woman with the gleaming wreath of finely wrought
roses on her brow, the Rose Crown of Andor. A long red stole, the
Lion of Andor marching along its length, hung over her silken dress
of red and white pleats, and when she touched the Captain-General&rsquo;s
arm with her left hand, a ring in the shape of the Great Serpent,
eating its own tail, glittered. Yet it was not the grandeur of
clothes or jewelry or even crown that drew Rand&rsquo;s eyes again and
again: it was the woman who wore them.</p>

<p>Morgase had her daughter&rsquo;s beauty, matured and
ripened. Her face and figure, her presence, filled the room like a
light that dimmed the other two with her. If she had been a widow
in Emond&rsquo;s Field, she would have had a line of suitors outside her
door even if she was the worst cook and most slovenly housekeeper
in the Two Rivers. He saw her studying him and ducked his head,
afraid she might be able to tell his thoughts from his face.
<em>Light, thinking about the Queen like she was a village woman!
You fool!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;You may rise,&rdquo; Morgase said in a rich, warm voice
that held Elayne&rsquo;s assurance of obedience a hundred times over.</p>

<p>Rand stood with the rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother&mdash;&rdquo; Elayne began, but Morgase cut her
off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been climbing trees, it seems, daughter.&rdquo;
Elayne plucked a stray fragment of bark from her dress and, finding
there was no place to put it, held it clenched in her hand. &ldquo;In
fact,&rdquo; Morgase went on calmly, &ldquo;it would seem that despite my
orders to the contrary you have contrived to take your look at this
Logain. Gawyn, I have thought better of you. You must learn not
only to obey your sister, but at the same time to be counterweight
for her against disaster.&rdquo; The Queen&rsquo;s eyes swung to the blocky man
beside her, then quickly away again. Bryne remained impassive, as
if he had not noticed, but Rand thought those eyes noticed
everything. &ldquo;That, Gawyn, is as much the duty of the First Prince
as is leading the armies of Andor. Perhaps if your training is
intensified, you will find less time for letting your sister lead
you into trouble. I will ask the Captain-General to see that you do
not lack for things to do on the journey north.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gawyn shifted his feet as if about to protest, then
bowed his head instead. &ldquo;As you command, mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne grimaced. &ldquo;Mother, Gawyn cannot keep me out of
trouble if he is not with me. It was for that reason alone he left
his rooms. Mother, surely there could be no harm in just looking at
Logain. Almost everyone in the city was closer to him than we.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everyone in the city is not the Daughter-Heir.&rdquo;
Sharpness underlay the Queen&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;I have seen this fellow
Logain from close, and he is dangerous, child. Caged, with Aes
Sedai to guard him every minute, he is still as dangerous as a
wolf. I wish he had never been brought near Caemlyn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will be dealt with in Tar Valon.&rdquo; The woman on
the stool did not take her eyes from her knitting as she spoke.
&ldquo;What is important is that the people see that the Light has once
again vanquished the Dark. And that they see you are part of that
victory, Morgase.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morgase waved a dismissive hand. &ldquo;I would still
rather he had never come near Caemlyn. Elayne, I know your
mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; Elayne protested, &ldquo;I do mean to obey you.
Truly I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do?&rdquo; Morgase asked in mock surprise, then
chuckled. &ldquo;Yes, you do try to be a dutiful daughter. But you
constantly test how far you may go. Well, I did the same with my
mother. That spirit will stand you in good stead when you ascend to
the throne, but you are not Queen yet, child. You have disobeyed me
and had your look at Logain. Be satisfied with that. On the journey
north you will not be allowed within one hundred paces of him,
neither you nor Gawyn. If I did not know just how hard your lessons
will be in Tar Valon, I would send Lini along to see that you obey.
She, at least, seems able to make you do as you must.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne bowed her head sullenly.</p>

<p>The woman behind the throne seemed occupied with
counting her stitches. &ldquo;In one week,&rdquo; she said suddenly, &ldquo;you will
be wanting to come home to your mother. In a month you will be
wanting to run away with the Traveling People. But my sisters will
keep you away from the unbeliever. That sort of thing is not for
you, not yet.&rdquo; Abruptly she turned on the stool to look intently at
Elayne, all her placidity gone as if it had never been. &ldquo;You have
it in you to be the greatest Queen that Andor has ever seen, that
any land has seen in more than a thousand years. It is for that we
will shape you, if you have the strength for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stared at her. She had to be Elaida, the Aes
Sedai. Suddenly he was glad he had not come to her for help, no
matter what her Ajah. A sternness far beyond Moiraine&rsquo;s radiated
from her. He had sometimes thought of Moiraine as steel covered
with velvet; with Elaida the velvet was only an illusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough, Elaida,&rdquo; Morgase said, frowning uneasily.
&ldquo;She has heard that more than enough. The Wheel weaves as the Wheel
wills.&rdquo; For a moment she was silent, looking at her daughter. &ldquo;Now
there is the problem of this young man&rdquo;&mdash;she gestured to Rand
without taking her eyes off Elayne&rsquo;s face&mdash;&ldquo;and how and why
he came here, and why you claimed guest-right for him to your
brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I speak, mother?&rdquo; When Morgase nodded her
assent, Elayne told of events simply, from the time she first saw
Rand climbing up the slope to the wall. He expected her to finish
by proclaiming the innocence of what he had done, but instead she
said, &ldquo;Mother, often you tell me I must know our people, from the
highest to the lowest, but whenever I meet any of them it is with a
dozen attendants. How can I come to know anything real or true
under such circumstances? In speaking with this young man I have
already learned more about the people of the Two Rivers, what kind
of people they are, than I ever could from books. It says something
that he has come so far and has put on the red, when so many
incomers wear the white from fear. Mother, I beg you not to misuse
a loyal subject, and one who has taught me much about the people
you rule.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A loyal subject from the Two Rivers.&rdquo; Morgase
sighed. &ldquo;My child, you should pay more heed to those books. The Two
Rivers has not seen a tax collector in six generations, nor the
Queen&rsquo;s Guards in seven. I daresay they seldom even think to
remember they are part of the Realm.&rdquo; Rand shrugged uncomfortably,
recalling his surprise when he was told the Two Rivers was part of
the Realm of Andor. The Queen saw him, and smiled ruefully at her
daughter. &ldquo;You see, child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elaida had put down her knitting, Rand realized, and
was studying him. She rose from her stool and slowly came down from
the dais to stand before him. &ldquo;From the Two Rivers?&rdquo; she said. She
reached a hand toward his head; he pulled away from her touch, and
she let her hand drop. &ldquo;With that red in his hair, and gray eyes?
Two Rivers people are dark of hair and eye, and they seldom have
such height.&rdquo; Her hand darted out to push back his coat sleeve,
exposing lighter skin the sun had not reached so often. &ldquo;Or such
skin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was an effort not to clench his fists. &ldquo;I was born
in Emond&rsquo;s Field,&rdquo; he said stiffly. &ldquo;My mother was an outlander;
that&rsquo;s where my eyes come from. My father is Tam al&rsquo;Thor, a
shepherd and farmer, as I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elaida nodded slowly, never taking her eyes from his
face. He met her gaze with a levelness that belied the sour feeling
in his stomach. He saw her note the steadiness of his look. Still
meeting him eye to eye, she moved her hand slowly toward him again.
He resolved not to flinch this time.</p>

<p>It was his sword she touched, not him, her hand
closing around the hilt at the very top. Her fingers tightened and
her eyes opened wide with surprise. &ldquo;A shepherd from the Two
Rivers,&rdquo; she said softly, a whisper meant to be heard by all, &ldquo;with
a heron-mark sword.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those last few words acted on the chamber as if she
had announced the Dark One. Leather and metal creaked behind Rand,
boots scuffling on the marble tiles. From the corner of his eye he
could see Tallanvor and another of the guardsmen backing away from
him to gain room, hands on their swords, prepared to draw and, from
their faces, prepared to die. In two quick strides Gareth Bryne was
at the front of the dais, between Rand and the Queen. Even Gawyn
put himself in front of Elayne, a worried look on his face and a
hand on his dagger. Elayne herself looked at him as if she were
seeing him for the first time. Morgase did not change expression,
but her hands tightened on the gilded arms of her throne.</p>

<p>Only Elaida showed less reaction than the Queen. The
Aes Sedai gave no sign that she had said anything out of the
ordinary. She took her hand from the sword, causing the soldiers to
tense even more. Her eyes stayed on his, unruffled and
calculating.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; Morgase said, her voice level, &ldquo;he is too
young to have earned a heron-mark blade. He cannot be any older
than Gawyn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It belongs with him,&rdquo; Gareth Bryne said.</p>

<p>The Queen looked at him in surprise. &ldquo;How can that
be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know, Morgase,&rdquo; Bryne said slowly. &ldquo;He is
too young, yet still it belongs with him, and he with it. Look at
his eyes. Look how he stands, how the sword fits him, and he it. He
is too young, but the sword is his.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the Captain-General fell silent, Elaida said,
&ldquo;How did you come by this blade, Rand al&rsquo;Thor from the Two Rivers?&rdquo;
She said it as if she doubted his name as much as she did where he
was from.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father gave it to me,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;It was his. He
thought I&rsquo;d need a sword, out in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet <em>another</em> shepherd from the Two Rivers
with a heron-mark blade.&rdquo; Elaida&rsquo;s smile made his mouth go dry.
&ldquo;When did you arrive in Caemlyn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had had enough of telling this woman the truth.
She made him as afraid as any Darkfriend had. It was time to start
hiding again. &ldquo;Today,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just in time,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Where are you staying?
Don&rsquo;t say you have not found a room somewhere. You look a little
tattered, but you have had a chance to freshen. Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Crown and Lion.&rdquo; He remembered passing The Crown
and Lion while looking for The Queen&rsquo;s Blessing. It was on the
other side of the New City from Master Gill&rsquo;s inn. &ldquo;I have a bed
there. In the attic.&rdquo; He had the feeling that she knew he was
lying, but she only nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What chance this?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Today the unbeliever
is brought into Caemlyn. In two days he will be taken north to Tar
Valon, and with him goes the Daughter-Heir for her training. And at
just this juncture a young man appears in the Palace gardens,
claiming to be a loyal subject from the Two Rivers&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>am</em> from the Two Rivers.&rdquo; They were all
looking at him, but all ignored him. All but Tallanvor and the
guards; those eyes never blinked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;with a story calculated to entice Elayne and
bearing a heron-mark blade. He does not wear an armband or a
cockade to proclaim his allegiance, but wrappings that carefully
conceal the heron from inquisitive eyes. What chance this,
Morgase?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Queen motioned the Captain-General to stand
aside, and when he did she studied Rand with a troubled look. It
was to Elaida that she spoke, though. &ldquo;What are you naming him?
Darkfriend? One of Logain&rsquo;s followers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Dark One stirs in Shayol Ghul,&rdquo; the Aes Sedai
replied. &ldquo;The Shadow lies across the Pattern, and the future is
balanced on the point of a pin. This one is dangerous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly Elayne moved, throwing herself onto her
knees before the throne. &ldquo;Mother, I beg you not to harm him. He
would have left immediately had I not stopped him. He wanted to go.
It was I who made him stay. I cannot believe he is a
Darkfriend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morgase made a soothing gesture toward her daughter,
but her eyes remained on Rand. &ldquo;Is this a Foretelling, Elaida? Are
you reading the Pattern? You say it comes on you when you least
expect it and goes as suddenly as it comes. If this is a
Foretelling, Elaida, I command you to speak the truth clearly,
without your usual habit of wrapping it in so much mystery that no
one can tell if you have said yes or no. Speak. What do you
see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This I Foretell,&rdquo; Elaida replied, &ldquo;and swear under
the Light that I can say no clearer. From this day Andor marches
toward pain and division. The Shadow has yet to darken to its
blackest, and I cannot see if the Light will come after. Where the
world has wept one tear, it will weep thousands. This I
Foretell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A pall of silence clung to the room, broken only by
Morgase expelling her breath as if it were her last.</p>

<p>Elaida continued to stare into Rand&rsquo;s eyes. She spoke
again, barely moving her lips, so softly that he could barely hear
her less than an arm&rsquo;s length away. &ldquo;This, too, I Foretell. Pain
and division come to the whole world, and this man stands at the
heart of it. I obey the Queen,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;and speak it
clearly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand felt as if his feet had become rooted in the
marble floor. The cold and stiffness of the stone crept up his legs
and sent a shiver up his spine. No one else could have heard. But
she was still looking at him, and he had heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a shepherd,&rdquo; he said for the entire room. &ldquo;From
the Two Rivers. A shepherd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills,&rdquo; Elaida said
aloud, and he could not tell if there was a touch of mockery in her
tone or not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord Gareth,&rdquo; Morgase said, &ldquo;I need the advice of my
Captain-General.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The blocky man shook his head. &ldquo;Elaida Sedai says the
lad is dangerous, My Queen, and if she could tell more I would say
summon the headsman. But all she says is what any of us can see
with our own eyes. There&rsquo;s not a farmer in the countryside won&rsquo;t
say things will get worse, without any Foretelling. Myself, I
believe the boy is here through mere happenstance, though an ill
one for him. To be safe, My Queen, I say clap him in a cell till
the Lady Elayne and the Lord Gawyn are well on their way, then let
him go. Unless, Aes Sedai, you have more to Foretell concerning
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have said all that I have read in the Pattern,
Captain-General,&rdquo; Elaida said. She flashed a hard smile at Rand, a
smile that barely bent her lips, mocking his inability to say that
she was not telling the truth. &ldquo;A few weeks imprisoned will not
harm him, and it may give me a chance to learn more.&rdquo; Hunger filled
her eyes, deepening his chill. &ldquo;Perhaps another Foretelling will
come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a time Morgase considered, chin on her fist and
elbow on the arm of her throne. Rand would have shifted under her
frowning gaze if he could have moved at all, but Elaida&rsquo;s eyes
froze him solid. Finally the Queen spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suspicion is smothering Caemlyn, perhaps all of
Andor. Fear and black suspicion. Women denounce their neighbors for
Darkfriends. Men scrawl the Dragon&rsquo;s Fang on the doors of people
they have known for years. I will not become part of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Morgase&mdash;&rdquo; Elaida began, but the Queen cut her
off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not become part of it. When I took the throne
I swore to uphold justice for the high and the low, and I will
uphold it even if I am the last in Andor to remember justice. Rand
al&rsquo;Thor, do you swear under the Light that your father, a shepherd
in the Two Rivers, gave you this heron-mark blade?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand worked his mouth to get enough moisture to
speak. &ldquo;I do.&rdquo; Abruptly remembering to whom he was speaking he
hastily added, &ldquo;My Queen.&rdquo; Lord Gareth raised a heavy eyebrow, but
Morgase did not seem to mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you climbed the garden wall simply to gain a
look at the false Dragon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my Queen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean harm to the throne of Andor, or to my
daughter, or my son?&rdquo; Her tone said the last two would gain him
even shorter shrift than the first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean no harm to anyone, my Queen. To you and yours
least of all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will give you justice then, Rand al&rsquo;Thor,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;First, because I have the advantage of Elaida and Gareth in
having heard Two Rivers speech when I was young. You have not the
look, but if a dim memory can serve me you have the Two Rivers on
your tongue. Second, no one with your hair and eyes would claim
that he is a Two Rivers shepherd unless it was true. And that your
father gave you a heron-mark blade is too preposterous to be a lie.
And third, the voice that whispers to me that the best lie is often
one too ridiculous to be taken for a lie&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that voice is not
proof. I will uphold the laws I have made. I give you your freedom,
Rand al&rsquo;Thor, but I suggest you take a care where you trespass in
the future. If you are found on the Palace grounds again, it will
not go so easily with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, my Queen,&rdquo; he said hoarsely. He could
feel Elaida&rsquo;s displeasure like a heat on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tallanvor,&rdquo; Morgase said, &ldquo;escort this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;escort
my daughter&rsquo;s guest from the Palace, and show him every courtesy.
The rest of you go as well. No, Elaida, you stay. And if you will
too, please, Lord Gareth. I must decide what to do about these
Whitecloaks in the city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tallanvor and the guardsmen sheathed their swords
reluctantly, ready to draw again in an instant. Still Rand was glad
to let the soldiers form a hollow box around him and to follow
Tallanvor. Elaida was only half attending what the Queen was
saying; he could feel her eyes on his back. <em>What would have
happened if Morgase had not kept the Aes Sedai with her?</em> The
thought made him wish the soldiers would walk faster.</p>

<p>To his surprise, Elayne and Gawyn exchanged a few
words outside the door, then fell in beside him. Tallanvor was
surprised, too. The young officer looked from them back to the
doors, closing now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mother,&rdquo; Elayne said, &ldquo;ordered him to be escorted
from the Palace, Tallanvor. With every courtesy. What are you
waiting for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tallanvor scowled at the doors, behind which the
Queen was conferring with her advisors. &ldquo;Nothing, my Lady,&rdquo; he said
sourly, and needlessly ordered the escort forward.</p>

<p>The wonders of the Palace slid by Rand unseen. He was
befuddled, snatches of thought spinning by too fast to grasp.
<em>You have not the look. This man stands at the heart of
it</em>.</p>

<p>The escort stopped. He blinked, startled to find
himself in the great court at the front of the Palace, standing at
the tall, gilded gates, gleaming in the sun. Those gates would not
be opened for a single man, certainly not for a trespasser, even if
the Daughter-Heir did claim guest-right for him.</p>

<p>Wordlessly Tallanvor unbarred a sally-port, a small
door set within one gate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the custom,&rdquo; Elayne said, &ldquo;to escort guests as
far as the gates, but not to watch them go. It is the pleasure of a
guest&rsquo;s company that should be remembered, not the sadness of
parting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, my Lady,&rdquo; Rand said. He touched the scarf
bandaging his head. &ldquo;For everything. Custom in the Two Rivers is
for a guest to bring a small gift. I&rsquo;m afraid I have nothing.
Although,&rdquo; he added dryly, &ldquo;apparently I did teach you something of
the Two Rivers folk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I had told Mother I think you are handsome, she
certainly would have had you locked in a cell.&rdquo; Elayne favored him
with a dazzling smile. &ldquo;Fare you well, Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gaping, he watched her go, a younger version of
Morgase&rsquo;s beauty and majesty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not try to bandy words with her.&rdquo; Gawyn laughed.
&ldquo;She will win every time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand nodded absently. <em>Handsome? Light, the
Daughter-Heir to the throne of Andor!</em> He gave himself a shake
to clear his head.</p>

<p>Gawyn seemed to be waiting for something. Rand looked
at him for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord, when I told you I was from the Two Rivers
you were surprised. And everybody else, your mother, Lord Gareth,
Elaida Sedai&rdquo;&mdash;a shiver ran down his back&mdash;&ldquo;none of
them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He could not finish it; he was not even sure why he
started. <em>I am Tam al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s son, even if I was not born in the
Two Rivers</em>.</p>

<p>Gawyn nodded as if it was for this he had been
waiting. Still he hesitated. Rand opened his mouth to take back the
unspoken question, and Gawyn said, &ldquo;Wrap a <em>shoufa</em> around
your head, Rand, and you would be the image of an Aielman. Odd,
since Mother seems to think you <em>sound</em> like a Two Rivers
man, at least. I wish we could have come to know one another, Rand
al&rsquo;Thor. Fare you well.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>An Aielman</em>.</p>

<p>Rand stood watching Gawyn&rsquo;s retreating back until an
impatient cough from Tallanvor reminded him where he was. He ducked
through the sallyport, barely clearing his heels before Tallanvor
slammed it behind him. The bars inside were jammed into place
loudly.</p>

<p>The oval plaza in front of the Palace was empty, now.
All the soldiers gone, all the crowds, trumpets, and drums vanished
in silence. Nothing left but a scattering of litter blowing across
the pavement and a few people hurrying about their business now
that the excitement was done. He could not make out if they showed
the red or the white.</p>

<p><em>Aielman</em>.</p>

<p>With a start he realized he was standing right in
front of the Palace gates, right where Elaida could find him easily
once she finished with the Queen. Pulling his cloak close, he broke
into a trot, across the plaza and into the streets of the Inner
City. He looked back frequently to see if anyone was following him,
but the sweeping curves kept him from seeing very far. He could
remember Elaida&rsquo;s eyes all too well, though, and imagined them
watching. By the time he reached the gates to the New City, he was
running.</p>
