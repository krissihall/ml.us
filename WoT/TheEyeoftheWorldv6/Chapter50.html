<h4><em>Meetings at the Eye</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">L</span>eading
the bay, Rand followed the Green Man with the
other Emond&rsquo;s Fielders, all staring as if they could not decide
whether to look at the Green Man or the forest. The Green Man was a
legend, of course, with stories told about him, and the Tree of
Life, in front of every fireplace in the Two Rivers, and not just
for the children. But after the Blight, the trees and flowers would
have been a wonder of normality even if the rest of the world was
not still trapped in winter.</p>

<p>Perrin hung a little to the rear. When Rand glanced
back, the big, curly-haired youth looked as if he did not want to
hear anything else the Green Man had to say. He could understand
that. <em>Child of the Dragon</em>. Warily he watched the Green
Man, walking ahead with Moiraine and Lan, butterflies surrounding
him in a cloud of yellows and reds. <em>What did he mean? No. I
don&rsquo;t want to know</em>.</p>

<p>Even so, his step felt lighter, his legs springier.
The uneasiness still lay in his gut, churning his stomach, but the
fear had become so diffuse it might as well be gone. He did not
think he could expect more, not with the Blight half a mile away,
even if Moiraine was right about nothing from the Blight being able
to enter here. The thousands of burning points piercing his bones
had winked out; at the very moment he came within the Green Man&rsquo;s
domain, he was sure. <em>It&rsquo;s him that winked them out</em>, he
thought, <em>the Green Man, and this place</em>.</p>

<p>Egwene felt it, and Nynaeve, too, the soothing peace,
the calm of beauty. He could tell. They wore small, serene smiles,
and brushed flowers with their fingers, pausing to smell, and
breathing deep.</p>

<p>When the Green Man noticed, he said, &ldquo;Flowers are
meant to adorn. The plants or humans, it is much the same. None
mind, so long as you don&rsquo;t take too many.&rdquo; And he began plucking
one from this plant and one from that, never more than two from
any. Soon Nynaeve and Egwene wore caps of blossoms in their hair,
pink wildrose and yellowbell and white morningstar. The Wisdom&rsquo;s
braid seemed a garden of pink and white to her waist. Even Moiraine
received a pale garland of morningstar on her brow, woven so deftly
that the flowers still seemed to be growing.</p>

<p>Rand was not sure they were not growing. The Green
Man tended his forest garden as he walked, while he talked softly
to Moiraine, taking care of whatever needed care without really
thinking about it. His hazelnut eyes caught a crooked limb on a
climbing wildrose, forced into an awkward angle by the
blossom-covered limb of an apple tree, and he paused, still
talking, to run his hand along the bend. Rand was not sure if his
eyes were playing tricks, or if thorns actually did bend out of the
way so as not to prick those green fingers. When the towering shape
of the Green Man moved on, the limb ran straight and true,
spreading red petals among the white of apple blossoms. He bent to
cup one huge hand around a tiny seed lying on a patch of pebbles,
and when he straightened, a small shoot had roots through the rocks
to good soil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All things must grow where they are, according to
the Pattern,&rdquo; he explained over his shoulder, as if apologizing,
&ldquo;and face the turning of the Wheel, but the Creator will not mind
if I give just a little help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand led Red around the shoot, careful not to let the
bay&rsquo;s hooves crush it. It did not seem right to destroy what the
Green Man had done just to avoid an extra step. Egwene smiled at
him, one of her secret smiles, and touched his arm. She was so
pretty, with her unbound hair full of flowers, that he smiled back
at her until she blushed and lowered her eyes. <em>I will protect
you</em>, he thought. <em>Whatever else happens, I will see you
safe, I swear it</em>.</p>

<p>Into the heart of the spring forest the Green Man
took them, to an arched opening in the side of a hill. It was a
simple stone arch, tall and white, and on the keystone was a circle
halved by a sinuous line, one half rough, the other smooth. The
ancient symbol of Aes Sedai. The opening itself was shadowed.</p>

<p>For a moment everyone simply looked in silence. Then
Moiraine removed the garland from her hair and gently hung it on
the limb of a sweetberry bush beside the arch. It was as if her
movement restored speech.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in there?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked. &ldquo;What we&rsquo;ve come
for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d really like to see the Tree of Life,&rdquo; Mat said,
not taking his eyes off the halved circle above them. &ldquo;We can wait
that long, can&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Green Man gave Rand an odd look, then shook his
head. &ldquo;<em>Avendesora</em> is not here. I have not rested beneath
its ungentle branches in two thousand years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Tree of Life is not why we came,&rdquo; Moiraine said
firmly. She gestured to the arch. &ldquo;In there, is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not go in with you,&rdquo; the Green Man said. The
butterflies around him swirled as if they shared some agitation. &ldquo;I
was set to guard it long, long ago, but it makes me uneasy to come
too close. I feel myself being unmade; my end is linked with it,
somehow. I remember the making of it. Some of the making. Some.&rdquo;
His hazelnut eyes stared, lost in memory, and he fingered his scar.
&ldquo;It was the first days of the Breaking of the World, when the joy
of victory over the Dark One turned bitter with the knowledge that
all might yet be shattered by the weight of the Shadow. A hundred
of them made it, men and women together. The greatest Aes Sedai
works were always done so, joining <em>saidin</em> and
<em>saidar</em>, as the True Source is joined. They died, all, to
make it pure, while the world was torn around them. Knowing they
would die, they charged me to guard it against the need to come. It
was not what I was made for, but all was breaking apart, and they
were alone, and I was all they had. It was not what I was made for,
but I have kept the faith.&rdquo; He looked down at Moiraine, nodding to
himself. &ldquo;I have kept faith, until it was needed. And now it
ends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have kept the faith better than most of us who
gave you the charge,&rdquo; the Aes Sedai said. &ldquo;Perhaps it will not come
as badly as you fear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The scarred, leafy head shook slowly from side to
side. &ldquo;I know an ending when it comes, Aes Sedai. I will find
another place to make things grow.&rdquo; Nutbrown eyes swept sadly over
the green forest. &ldquo;Another place, perhaps. When you come out, I
will see you again, if there is time.&rdquo; With that he strode away,
trailing butterflies, becoming one with the forest more completely
than Lan&rsquo;s cloak ever could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did he mean?&rdquo; Mat demanded. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s
time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; Moiraine said. And she stepped through the
arch. Lan went at her heels.</p>

<p>Rand was not sure what he expected when he followed.
The hair stirred uneasily on his arms, and rose on the back of his
neck. But it was only a corridor, its polished walls rounded
overhead like the arch, winding gently downward. There was headroom
enough and to spare for Loial; there would have been room enough
for the Green Man. The smooth floor, slick to the eye like oiled
slate, yet somehow gave a sure footing. Seamless, white walls
glittered with uncounted flecks in untold colors, giving a low,
soft light even after the sunlit archway vanished around a curve
behind. He was sure the light was no natural thing, but he sensed
it was benign, too. <em>Then why is your skin still crawling?</em>
Down they went, and down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; Moiraine said at last, pointing.
&ldquo;Ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the corridor opened into a vast, domed space, the
rough, living rock of its ceiling dotted with clumps of glowing
crystals. Below it, a pool took up the entire cavern, except for
the walkway around it, perhaps five paces wide. In the oval shape
of an eye, the pool was lined about its rim with a low, flat
edging of crystals that glowed with a duller, yet fiercer, light
than those above. Its surface was as smooth as glass and as clear
as the Winespring Water. Rand felt as if his eyes could penetrate
it forever, but he could not see any bottom to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Eye of the World,&rdquo; Moiraine said softly beside
him.</p>

<p>As he looked around in wonder, he realized that the
long years since the making&mdash;three thousand of them&mdash;had worked their
way while no one came. Not all the crystals in the dome glowed with
the same intensity. Some were stronger, some weaker; some
flickered, and others were only faceted lumps to sparkle in a
captured light. Had all shone, the dome would have been as bright
as noonday, but they made it only late afternoon, now. Dust coated
the walkway, and bits of stone and even crystal. Long years
waiting, while the Wheel turned and ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But <em>what</em> is it?&rdquo; Mat asked uneasily. &ldquo;That
doesn&rsquo;t look like any water I ever saw.&rdquo; He kicked a lump of dark
stone the size of his fist over the edge. &ldquo;It&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stone struck the glassy surface and slid into the
pool without a splash, or so much as a ripple. As it sank, the rock
began to swell, growing ever larger, larger and more attenuated, a
blob the size of his head that Rand could almost see through, a
faint blur as wide as his arm was long. Then it was gone. He
thought his skin would creep right off his body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he demanded, and was shocked at the
hoarse harshness of his own voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might be called the essence of <em>saidin</em>.&rdquo;
The Aes Sedai&rsquo;s words echoed round the dome. &ldquo;The essence of the
male half of the True Source, the pure essence of the Power wielded
by men before the Time of Madness. The Power to mend the seal on
the Dark One&rsquo;s prison, or to break it open completely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light shine on us and protect us,&rdquo; Nynaeve
whispered. Egwene clutched her as if she wanted to hide behind the
Wisdom. Even Lan stirred uneasily, though there was no surprise in
his eyes.</p>

<p>Stone thudded into Rand&rsquo;s shoulders, and he realized
he had backed as far as the wall, as far from the Eye of the World
as he could get. He would have pushed himself right through the
wall, if he could have. Mat, too, was splayed out against the stone
as flat as he could make himself. Perrin was staring at the pool
with his axe half drawn. His eyes shone, yellow and fierce.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always wondered,&rdquo; Loial said uneasily. &ldquo;When I
read about it, I always wondered what it was. Why? Why did they do
it? And how?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one living knows.&rdquo; Moiraine no longer looked at
the pool. She was watching Rand and his two friends, studying them,
her eyes weighing. &ldquo;Neither the how, nor more of the why than that
it would be needed one day, and that that need would be the
greatest and most desperate the world had faced to that time.
Perhaps ever would face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many in Tar Valon have attempted to find a way to
use this Power, but it is as untouchable for any woman as the moon
is for a cat. Only a man could channel it, but the last male Aes
Sedai is nearly three thousand years gone. Yet the need they saw
was a desperate one. They worked through the taint of the Dark One
on <em>saidin</em> to make it, and make it pure, knowing that doing
so would kill them all. Male Aes Sedai and female together. The
Green Man spoke true. The greatest wonders of the Age of Legends
were done in that way, <em>saidin</em> and <em>saidar</em>
together. All the women in Tar Valon, all the Aes Sedai in all the
courts and cities, even with those in the lands beyond the Waste,
even counting those who may still live beyond the Aryth Ocean,
could not fill a spoon with the Power, lacking men to work with
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s throat rasped as if he had been screaming.
&ldquo;Why did you bring us here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you are <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>.&rdquo; The Aes Sedai&rsquo;s
face was unreadable. Her eyes shimmered, and seemed to pull at him.
&ldquo;Because the Dark One&rsquo;s power will strike here, and because it must
be confronted and stopped, or the Shadow will cover the world.
There is no need greater than that. Let us go out into the sunlight
again, while there is yet time.&rdquo; Without waiting to see if they
would follow, she started back up the corridor with Lan, who
stepped perhaps a bit more quickly than usual for him. Egwene and
Nynaeve hurried behind her.</p>

<p>Rand edged along the wall&mdash;he could not make
himself get even one step closer to what the pool was&mdash;and
scrambled into the corridor in a tangle with Mat and Perrin. He
would have run if it had not meant trampling Egwene and Nynaeve,
Moiraine and Lan. He could not stop shaking even when he was back
outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not like this, Moiraine,&rdquo; Nynaeve said angrily
when the sun shone on them again. &ldquo;I believe the danger is as great
as you say or I would not be here, but this is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have found you at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand jerked as if a rope had tightened around his
neck. The words, the voice&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;for a moment he believed it was
Ba&rsquo;alzamon. But the two men who walked out of the trees, faces
hidden by their cowls, did not wear cloaks the color of dried
blood. One cloak was a dark gray, the other almost as dark a green,
and they seemed musty even in the open air. And the men were not
Fades; the breeze stirred their cloaks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Lan&rsquo;s stance was cautious, his hand on
his sword hilt. &ldquo;How did you come here? If you are seeking the
Green Man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He guided us.&rdquo; The hand that pointed to Mat was old
and shriveled to scarcely human, lacking a fingernail and with
knuckles gnarled like knots in a piece of rope. Mat took a step
back, eyes widening. &ldquo;An old thing, an old friend, an old enemy.
But he is not the one we seek,&rdquo; the green-cloaked man finished. The
other man stood as if he would never speak.</p>

<p>Moiraine straightened to her full height, no more
than shoulder high to any man there, but suddenly seeming as tall
as the hills. Her voice rang like a bell, demanding, &ldquo;Who are
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hands pushed back hoods, and Rand goggled. The old
man was older than old; he made Cenn Buie look like a child in the
bloom of health. The skin of his face was like crazed parchment
drawn tight over a skull, then pulled tighter still. Wispy tufts of
brittle hair stood at odd places on his scabrous scalp. His ears
were withered bits like scraps of ancient leather; his eyes sunken,
peering out of his head as if from the ends of tunnels. Yet the
other was worse. A tight, black leather carapace covered that one&rsquo;s
head and face completely, but the front of it was worked into a
perfect face, a young man&rsquo;s face, laughing wildly, laughing
insanely, frozen forever. <em>What is he hiding if the other shows
what he shows?</em> Then even thought froze in his head, shattered
to dust and blew away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am called Aginor,&rdquo; the old one said. &ldquo;And he is
Balthamel. He no longer speaks with his tongue. The Wheel grinds
exceedingly fine over three thousand years imprisoned.&rdquo; His sunken
eyes slid to the arch; Balthamel leaned forward, his mask&rsquo;s eyes on
the white stone opening, as if he wanted to go straight in. &ldquo;So
long without,&rdquo; Aginor said softly. &ldquo;So long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light protect&mdash;&rdquo; Loial began, his voice
shaking, and cut off abruptly when Aginor looked at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Forsaken,&rdquo; Mat said hoarsely, &ldquo;are bound in
Shayol Ghul&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were bound.&rdquo; Aginor smiled; his yellowed teeth had
the look of fangs. &ldquo;Some of us are bound no longer. The seals
weaken, Aes Sedai. Like Ishamael, we walk the world again, and soon
the rest of us will come. I was too close to this world in my
captivity, I and Balthamel, too close to the grinding of the Wheel,
but soon the Great Lord of the Dark will be free, and give us new
flesh, and the world will be ours once more. You will have no Lews
Therin Kinslayer, this time. No Lord of the Morning to save you. We
know the one we seek now, and there is no more need for the rest of
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan&rsquo;s sword sprang from its scabbard too fast for
Rand&rsquo;s eye to follow. Yet the Warder hesitated, eyes flickering to
Moiraine, to Nynaeve. The two women stood well apart; to put
himself between either of them and the Forsaken would put him
further from the other. Only for a heartbeat the hesitation lasted,
but as the Warder&rsquo;s feet moved, Aginor raised his hand. It was a
scornful gesture, a flipping of his gnarled fingers as if to shoo
away a fly. The Warder flew backwards through the air as though a
huge fist had caught him. With a dull thud Lan struck the stone
arch, hanging there for an instant before dropping in a flaccid
heap, his sword lying near his outstretched hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;NO!&rdquo; Nynaeve screamed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be still!&rdquo; Moiraine commanded, but before anyone
else could move the Wisdom&rsquo;s knife had left her belt, and she was
running toward the Forsaken, her small blade upraised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light blind you,&rdquo; she cried, striking at
Aginor&rsquo;s chest.</p>

<p>The other Forsaken moved like a viper. While her blow
still fell, Balthamel&rsquo;s leather-cased hand darted out to seize her
chin, fingers sinking into one cheek while thumb dug into the
other, driving the blood out with their pressure and raising the
flesh in pale ridges. A convulsion wracked Nynaeve from head to
toe, as if she had been cracked like a whip. Her knife dropped
uselessly from dangling fingers as Balthamel lifted her by his
grip, brought her up to where the leather mask stared into her
still-quivering face. Her toes spasmed a foot above the ground;
flowers rained from her hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have almost forgotten the pleasures of the flesh.&rdquo;
Aginor&rsquo;s tongue crossed his withered lips, sounding like stone on
rough leather. &ldquo;But Balthamel remembers much.&rdquo; The laughter of the
mask seemed to grow wilder, and the wail that left Nynaeve burned
Rand&rsquo;s ears like despair ripped from her living heart.</p>

<p>Suddenly Egwene moved, and Rand saw that she was
going to help Nynaeve. &ldquo;Egwene, no!&rdquo; he shouted, but she did not
stop. His hand had gone to his sword at Nynaeve&rsquo;s cry, but now he
abandoned it and threw himself at Egwene. He thudded into her
before she took her third step, carrying them both to the ground.
Egwene landed under him with a gasp, immediately thrashing to get
free.</p>

<p>Others were moving, too, he realized. Perrin&rsquo;s axe
whirled into his hands, and his eyes glowed golden and fierce.
&ldquo;Wisdom!&rdquo; Mat howled, the dagger from Shadar Logoth in his
fist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Rand called. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t fight the Forsaken!&rdquo;
But they ran past him as if they had not heard, their eyes on
Nynaeve and the two Forsaken.</p>

<p>Aginor glanced at them, unconcernedly&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and
smiled.</p>

<p>Rand felt the air stir above him like the crack of a
giant&rsquo;s whip. Mat and Perrin, not even halfway to the Forsaken,
stopped as if they had run into a wall, bounced back to sprawl on
the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Aginor said. &ldquo;A fitting place for you. If you
learn to abase yourself properly in worship of us, I might let you
live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hastily Rand scrambled to his feet. Perhaps he could
not fight the Forsaken&mdash;no ordinary human could&mdash;but he
would not let them believe for a minute that he was groveling
before them. He tried to help Egwene up, but she slapped his hands
away and stood by herself, angrily brushing off her dress. Mat and
Perrin had also stubbornly pushed themselves unsteadily erect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will learn,&rdquo; Aginor said, &ldquo;if you want to live.
Now that I have found what I need&rdquo;&mdash;his eyes went to the
stone archway&mdash;&ldquo;I may take the time to teach you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This shall not be!&rdquo; The Green Man strode out of the
trees with a voice like lightning striking an ancient oak. &ldquo;You do
not belong here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aginor spared him a brief, contemptuous glance.
&ldquo;Begone! Your time is ended, all your kind but you long since dust.
Live what life is left to you and be glad you are beneath our
notice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is my place,&rdquo; the Green Man said, &ldquo;and you
shall hurt no living thing here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Balthamel tossed Nynaeve aside like a rag, and like a
crumpled rag she fell, eyes staring, limp as if all her bones had
melted. One leather-clad hand lifted, and the Green Man roared as
smoke rose from the vines that wove him. The wind in the trees
echoed his pain.</p>

<p>Aginor turned back to Rand and the others, as if the
Green Man had been dealt with, but one long stride and massive,
leafy arms wrapped themselves around Balthamel, raising him high,
crushing him against a chest of thick creepers, black leather mask
laughing into hazelnut eyes dark with anger. Like serpents
Balthamel&rsquo;s arms writhed free, his gloved hands grasping the Green
Man&rsquo;s head as though he would wrench it off. Flames shot up where
those hands touched, vines withering, leaves falling. The Green Man
bellowed as thick, dark smoke poured out between the vines of his
body. On and on he roared, as if all of him were coming out of his
mouth with the smoke that billowed between his lips.</p>

<p>Suddenly Balthamel jerked in the Green Man&rsquo;s grasp.
The Forsaken&rsquo;s hands tried to push him away instead of clutching
him. One gloved hand flung wide&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and a tiny creeper burst
through the black leather. A fungus, such as rings trees in the
deep shadows of the forest, ringed his arm, sprang from nowhere to
full-grown, swelling to cover the length of it. Balthamel thrashed,
and a shoot of stinkweed ripped open his carapace, lichens dug in
their roots and split tiny cracks across the leather of his face,
nettles broke the eyes of his mask, deathshead mushrooms tore open
the mouth.</p>

<p>The Green Man threw the Forsaken down. Balthamel
twisted and jerked as all the things that grew in the dark places,
all the things with spores, all the things that loved the dank,
swelled and grew, tore cloth and leather and flesh&mdash;Was it flesh,
seen in that brief moment of verdant rage?&mdash;to tattered shreds and
covered him until only a mound remained, indistinguishable from
many in the shaded depths of the green forest, and the mound moved
no more than they.</p>

<p>With a groan like a limb breaking under too great a
weight, the Green Man crashed to the ground. Half his head was
charred black. Tendrils of smoke still rose from him, like gray
creepers. Burned leaves fell from his arm as he painfully stretched
out his blackened hand to gently cup an acorn.</p>

<p>The earth rumbled as an oak seedling pushed up
between his fingers. The Green Man&rsquo;s head fell, but the seedling
reached for the sun, straining. Roots shot out and thickened,
delved beneath the ground and rose again, thickened more as they
sank. The trunk broadened and stretched upward, bark turning gray
and fissured and ancient. Limbs spread and grew heavy, as big as
arms, as big as men, and lifted to caress the sky, thick with green
leaves, dense with acorns. The massive web of roots turned the
earth like plows as it spread; the already huge trunk shivered,
grew wider, round as a house. Stillness came. And an oak that could
have stood five hundred years covered the spot where the Green Man
had been, marking the tomb of a legend. Nynaeve lay on the gnarled
roots, grown curved to her shape, to make a bed for her to rest
upon. The wind sighed through the oak&rsquo;s branches; it seemed to
murmur farewell.</p>

<p>Even Aginor seemed stunned. Then his head lifted,
cavernous eyes burning with hate. &ldquo;Enough! It is past time to end
this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Forsaken,&rdquo; Moiraine said, her voice as cold as
deep-winter ice. &ldquo;Past time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai&rsquo;s hand rose, and the ground fell away
beneath Aginor&rsquo;s feet. Flame roared from the chasm, whipped to a
frenzy by wind howling in from every direction, sucking a maelstrom
of leaves into the fire, which seemed to solidify into a
red-streaked yellow jelly of pure heat. In the middle of it Aginor
stood, his feet supported only by air. The Forsaken looked
startled, but then he smiled and took a step forward. It was a slow
step, as if the fire tried to root him to the spot, but he took it,
and then another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run!&rdquo; Moiraine commanded. Her face was white with
strain. &ldquo;All of you run!&rdquo; Aginor stepped across the air, toward the
edge of the flames.</p>

<p>Rand was aware of others moving, Mat and Perrin
dashing away at the edge of his vision, Loial&rsquo;s long legs carrying
him into the trees, but all he could really see was Egwene. She
stood there rigid, face pale and eyes closed. It was not fear that
held her, he realized. She was trying to throw her puny, untrained
wielding of the Power against the Forsaken.</p>

<p>Roughly he grabbed her arm and pulled her around to
face him. &ldquo;Run!&rdquo; he shouted at her. Her eyes opened, staring at
him, angry with him for interfering, liquid with hate for Aginor,
with fear of the Forsaken. &ldquo;Run,&rdquo; he said, pushing her toward the
trees hard enough to start her. &ldquo;Run!&rdquo; Once started, she did
run.</p>

<p>But Aginor&rsquo;s withered face turned toward him, toward
the running Egwene behind him, as the Forsaken walked through the
flames, as if what the Aes Sedai was doing did not concern Aginor
at all. Toward Egwene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not her!&rdquo; Rand shouted. &ldquo;The Light burn you, not
her!&rdquo; He snatched up a rock and threw it, meaning to draw Aginor&rsquo;s
attention. Halfway to the Forsaken&rsquo;s face, the stone turned to a
handful of dust.</p>

<p>He hesitated only a moment, long enough to glance
over his shoulder and see that Egwene was hidden in the trees. The
flames still surrounded Aginor, patches of his cloak smoldering,
but he walked as if he had all the time in the world, and the
fire&rsquo;s rim was near. Rand turned and ran. Behind him he heard
Moiraine begin to scream.</p>
