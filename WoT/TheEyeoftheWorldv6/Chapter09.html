<h4><em>Tellings of the Wheel</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">R</span>and&rsquo;s
heart pounded as he ran, and he stared in dismay at the
barren hills surrounding him. This was not just a place where
spring was late in coming; spring had never come here, and never
would come. Nothing grew in the cold soil that crunched under his
boots, not so much as a bit of lichen. He scrambled past boulders,
twice as tall as he was; dust coated the stone as if never a drop
of rain had touched it. The sun was a swollen, blood red ball, more
fiery than on the hottest day of summer and bright enough to sear
his eyes, but it stood stark against a leaden cauldron of a sky
where clouds of sharp black and silver roiled and boiled on every
horizon. For all the swirling clouds, though, no breath of breeze
stirred across the land, and despite the sullen sun the air burned
cold like the depths of winter.</p>

<p>Rand looked over his shoulder often as he ran, but he could not
see his pursuers. Only desolate hills and jagged black mountains,
many topped by tall plumes of dark smoke rising to join the milling
clouds. If he could not see his hunters, though, he could hear
them, howling behind him, guttural voices shouting with the glee of
the chase, howling with the joy of blood to come. Trollocs. Coming
closer, and his strength was almost gone.</p>

<p>With desperate haste he scrambled to the top of a knife edged
ridge, then dropped to his knees with a groan. Below him a sheer
rock wall fell away, a thousand-foot cliff plummeting into a vast
canyon. Steamy mists covered the canyon floor, their thick gray
surface rolling in grim waves, rolling and breaking against the
cliff beneath him, but more slowly than any ocean wave had ever
moved. Patches of fog glowed red for an instant as if great fires
had suddenly flared beneath, then died. Thunder rumbled in the
depths of the valley, and lightning crackled through the gray,
sometimes striking up at the sky.</p>

<p>It was not the valley itself that sapped his strength and filled
the empty spaces left with helplessness. From the center of the
furious vapors a mountain thrust upward, a mountain taller than any
he had ever seen in the Mountains of Mist, a mountain as black as
the loss of all hope. That bleak stone spire, a dagger stabbing at
the heavens, was the source of his desolation. He had never seen it
before, but he knew it. The memory of it flashed away like
quicksilver when he tried to touch it, but the memory was there. He
knew it was there.</p>

<p>Unseen fingers touched him, pulled at his arms and legs, trying
to draw him to the mountain. His body twitched, ready to obey. His
arms and legs stiffened, as if he thought he could dig his fingers
and toes into the stone. Ghostly strings entwined around his heart,
pulling him, calling him to the spire mountain. Tears ran down his
face, and he sagged to the ground. He felt his will draining away
like water out of a holed bucket. Just a little longer, and he
would go where he was called. He would obey, do as he was told.
Abruptly he discovered another emotion: anger. Push him, pull him,
he was not a sheep to be prodded into a pen. The anger squeezed
itself into one hard knot, and he clung to it as he would have
clung to a raft in a flood.</p>

<p><em>Serve me</em>, a voice whispered in the stillness of his mind. A
familiar voice. If he listened hard enough he was sure he would
know it. <em>Serve me</em>. He shook his head to try to get it out of his
head. <em>Serve me!</em> He shook his fist at the black mountain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light consume you, Shai&rsquo;tan!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly the smell of death lay thick around him. A figure
loomed over him, in a cloak the color of dried blood, a figure with
a face&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He did not want to see the face that looked down at
him. He did not want to think of that face. It hurt to think of it,
turned his mind to embers. A hand reached toward him. Not caring if
he fell over the edge, he threw himself away.</p>

<p>He had to get away. Far away. He fell, flailing at the air,
wanting to scream, finding no breath for screaming, no breath at
all.</p>

<p>Abruptly he was no longer in the barren land, no longer falling.
Winter-brown grass flattened under his boots; it seemed like
flowers. He almost laughed to see scattered trees and bushes,
leafless as they were, dotting the gently rolling plain that now
surrounded him. In the distance reared a single mountain, its peak
broken and split, but this mountain brought no fear or despair. It
was just a mountain, though oddly out of place there, with no other
in sight.</p>

<p>A broad river flowed by the mountain, and on an island in the
middle of that river was a city such as might live in a gleeman&rsquo;s
tale, a city surrounded by high walls gleaming white and silver
beneath the warm sun. With mingled relief and joy he started for
the walls, for the safety and serenity he somehow knew he would
find behind them.</p>

<p>As he came closer he made out soaring towers, many joined by
wondrous walkways that spanned the open air. High bridges arched
from both banks of the river to the island city. Even at a distance
he could see lacy stonework on those spans, seemingly too delicate
to withstand the swift waters that rushed beneath them. Beyond
those bridges lay safety. Sanctuary.</p>

<p>Of a sudden a chill ran along his bones; an icy clamminess
settled on his skin, and the air around him turned fetid and dank.
Without looking back he ran, ran from the pursuer whose freezing
fingers brushed his back and tugged at his cloak, ran from the
light-eating figure with the face that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He could not remember
the face, except as terror. He did not want to remember the face.
He ran, and the ground passed beneath his feet, rolling hills and
flat plain&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and he wanted to howl like a dog gone mad. The
city was receding before him. The harder he ran, the further away
drifted the white shining walls and haven. They grew smaller, and
smaller, until only a pale speck remained on the horizon. The cold
hand of his pursuer clutched at his collar. If those fingers
touched him he knew he would go mad. Or worse. Much worse. Even as
that surety came to him he tripped and fell&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Noooo!&rdquo; he screamed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>and grunted as paving stones smacked
the breath out of him. Wonderingly he got to his feet. He stood on
the approaches to one of the marvellous bridges he had seen rearing
over the river. Smiling people walked by on either side of him,
people dressed in so many colors they made him think of a field of
wildflowers. Some of them spoke to him, but he could not
understand, though the words sounded as if he should. But the faces
were friendly, and the people gestured him onward, over the bridge
with its intricate stonework, onward toward the shining,
silver-streaked walls and the towers beyond. Toward the safety he
knew waited there.</p>

<p>He joined the throng streaming across the bridge and into the
city through massive gates set in tall, pristine walls. Within was
a wonderland where the meanest structure seemed a palace. It was as
though the builders had been told to take stone and brick and tile
and create beauty to take the breath of mortal men. There was no
building, no monument that did not make him stare with goggling
eyes. Music drifted down the streets, a hundred different songs,
but all blending with the clamor of the crowds to make one grand,
joyous harmony. The scents of sweet perfumes and sharp spices, of
wondrous foods and myriad flowers, all floated in the air, as if
every good smell in the world were gathered there.</p>

<p>The street by which he entered the city, broad and paved with
smooth, gray stone, stretched straight before him toward the center
of the city. At its end loomed a tower larger and taller than any
other in the city, a tower as white as fresh-fallen snow. That
tower was where safety lay, and the knowledge he sought. But the
city was such as he had never dreamed of seeing. Surely it would
not matter if he delayed just a short time in going to the tower?
He turned aside onto a narrower street, where jugglers strolled
among hawkers of strange fruits.</p>

<p>Ahead of him down the street was a snow-white tower. The same
tower. <em>In just a little while</em>, he thought, and rounded another
corner. At the far end of this street, too, lay the white tower.
Stubbornly he turned another corner, and another, and each time the
alabaster tower met his eyes. He spun to run away from it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and
skidded to a halt. Before him, the white tower. He was afraid to
look over his shoulder, afraid it would be there, too.</p>

<p>The faces
around him were still friendly, but shattered hope filled them now,
hope he had broken. Still the people gestured him forward, pleading
gestures. Toward the tower. Their eyes shone with desperate need,
and only he could fulfill it, only he could save them.</p>

<p><em>Very well</em>,
he thought. The tower was, after all, where he wanted to go.</p>

<p>Even as he took his first step forward disappointment faded from
those about him, and smiles wreathed every face. They moved with
him, and small children strewed his path with flower petals. He
looked over his shoulder in confusion, wondering who the flowers
were meant for, but behind him were only more smiling people
gesturing him on. <em>They must be for me</em>, he thought, and wondered why
that suddenly did not seem strange at all. But wonderment lasted
only a moment before melting away; all was as it should be.</p>

<p>First one, then another of the people began to sing, until every
voice was lifted in a glorious anthem. He still could not
understand the words, but a dozen interweaving harmonies shouted
joy and salvation. Musicians capered through the on-flowing crowd,
adding flutes and harps and drums in a dozen sizes to the hymn, and
all the songs he had heard before blended in without seam. Girls
danced around him, laying garlands of sweet-smelling blossoms
across his shoulders, twining them about his neck. They smiled at
him, their delight growing with every step he took. He could not
help but smile back. His feet itched to join in their dance, and
even as he thought of it he was dancing, his steps fitting as if he
had known it all from birth. He threw back his head and laughed;
his feet were lighter than they had ever been, dancing with&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He could not remember the name, but it did not seem important.</p>

<p><em>It is your destiny</em>, a voice whispered in his head, and the
whisper was a thread in the paean.</p>

<p>Carrying him like a twig on the crest of a wave, the crowd
flowed into a huge square in the middle of the city, and for the
first time he saw that the white tower rose from a great palace of
pale marble, sculpted rather than built, curving walls and swelling
domes and delicate spires fingering the sky. The whole of it made
him gasp in awe. Broad stairs of pristine stone led up from the
square, and at the foot of those stairs the people halted, but
their song rose ever higher. The swelling voices buoyed his
feet. <em>Your destiny</em>, the voice whispered, insistent now, eager.</p>

<p>He no longer danced, but neither did he stop. He mounted the
stairs without hesitation. This was where he belonged.</p>

<p>Scrollwork covered the massive doors at the top of the stairs,
carvings so intricate and delicate that he could not imagine a
knife blade fine enough to fit. The portals swung open, and he went
in. They closed behind him with an echoing crash like thunder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have been waiting for you,&rdquo; the Myrddraal hissed.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Rand sat bolt upright, gasping for breath and shivering,
staring. Tam was still asleep on the bed. Slowly his breathing
slowed. Half-consumed logs blazed in the fireplace with a good bed
of coals built up around the fire irons; someone had been there to
tend it while he slept. A blanket lay at his feet, where it had
fallen when he woke. The makeshift litter was gone, too, and his
and Tam&rsquo;s cloaks had been hung by the door.</p>

<p>He wiped cold sweat from his face with a hand that was none too
steady and wondered if naming the Dark One in a dream brought his
attention the same way that naming him aloud did.</p>

<p>Twilight darkened
the window; the moon was well up, round and fat, and evening stars
sparkled above the Mountains of Mist. He had slept the day away. He
rubbed a sore spot on his side. Apparently he had slept with the
sword hilt jabbing him in the ribs. Between that and an empty
stomach and the night before, it was no wonder he had had
nightmares.</p>

<p>His belly rumbled, and he got up stiffly and made his way to the
table where Mistress al&rsquo;Vere had left the tray. He twitched aside
the white napkin. Despite the time he had slept, the beef broth was
still warm, and so was the crusty bread. Mistress al&rsquo;Vere&rsquo;s hand
was plain; the tray had been replaced. Once she decided you needed
a hot meal, she did not give up till it was inside you.</p>

<p>He gulped down some broth, and it was all he could do to put
some meat and cheese between two pieces of bread before stuffing it
in his mouth. Taking big bites, he went back to the bed.</p>

<p>Mistress al&rsquo;Vere had apparently seen to Tam, as well. Tam had
been undressed, his clothes now clean and neatly folded on the
bedside table, and a blanket was drawn up under his chin. When Rand
touched his father&rsquo;s forehead, Tam opened his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you are, boy. Marin said you were here, but I couldn&rsquo;t
even sit up to see. She said you were too tired for her to wake
just so I could look at you. Even Bran can&rsquo;t get around to find her
when she has her mind set.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tam&rsquo;s voice was weak, but his gaze was clear and steady. <em>The Aes
Sedai was right</em>, Rand thought. With rest he would be as good as
ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I get you something to eat? Mistress al&rsquo;Vere left a
tray.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She fed me already&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;if you can call it that. Wouldn&rsquo;t let
me have anything but broth. How can a man avoid bad dreams with
nothing but broth in his&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Tam fumbled a hand from under the
cover and touched the sword at Rand&rsquo;s waist. &ldquo;Then it wasn&rsquo;t a dream.
When Marin told me I was sick, I
thought I had been&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;But you&rsquo;re all right. That is all that
matters. What of the farm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand took a deep breath. &ldquo;The Trollocs killed the sheep. I think
they took the cow, too, and the house needs a good cleaning.&rdquo; He
managed a weak smile. &ldquo;We were luckier than some. They burned half
the village.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He told Tam everything that had happened, or at least most of
it. Tam listened closely, and asked sharp questions, so he found
himself having to tell about returning to the farmhouse from the
woods, and that brought in the Trolloc he had killed. He had to
tell how Nynaeve had said Tam was dying to explain why the Aes
Sedai had tended him instead of the Wisdom. Tam&rsquo;s eyes widened at
that, an Aes Sedai in Emond&rsquo;s Field. But Rand could see no need to
go over every step of the journey from the farm, or his fears, or
the Myrddraal on the road. Certainly not his nightmares as he slept
by the bed. Especially he saw no reason to mention Tam&rsquo;s ramblings
under the fever. Not yet. Moraine&rsquo;s story, though: there was no
avoiding that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s a tale to make a gleeman proud,&rdquo; Tam muttered when
he was done. &ldquo;What would Trollocs want with you boys? Or the Dark
One, Light help us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think she was lying? Master al&rsquo;Vere said she was telling
the truth about only two farms being attacked. And about Master
Luhhan&rsquo;s house, and Master Cauthon&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Tam lay silent before saying, &ldquo;Tell me what she
said. Her exact words, mind, just as she said them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand struggled. Who ever remembered the exact words they heard?
He chewed at his lip and scratched his head, and bit by bit he
brought it out, as nearly as he could remember. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of
anything else,&rdquo; he finished. &ldquo;Some of it I&rsquo;m not too sure she
didn&rsquo;t say a little differently, but it&rsquo;s close, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good enough. It has to be, doesn&rsquo;t it? You see, lad, Aes
Sedai are tricksome. They don&rsquo;t lie, not right out, but the truth
an Aes Sedai tells you is not always the truth you think it is. You
take care around her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard the stories,&rdquo; Rand retorted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re not, so you&rsquo;re not.&rdquo; Tam sighed heavily, then
shrugged in annoyance. &ldquo;I should be going along with you, just the
same. The world outside the Two Rivers is nothing like Emond&rsquo;s
Field.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was an opening to ask about Tam going outside and all the
rest of it, but Rand did not take it. His mouth fell open, instead.
&ldquo;Just like that? I thought you would try to talk me out of it. I
thought you&rsquo;d have a hundred reasons I should not go.&rdquo; He realized
he had been hoping Tam would have a hundred reasons, and good
ones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe not a hundred,&rdquo; Tam said with a snort, &ldquo;but a few did
come to mind. Only they don&rsquo;t count for much. If Trollocs are after
you, you will be safer in Tar Valon than you could ever be here.
Just remember to be wary. Aes Sedai do things for their own
reasons, and those are not always the reasons you think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gleeman said something like that,&rdquo; Rand said slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he knows what he&rsquo;s talking about. You listen sharp, think
deep, and guard your tongue. That&rsquo;s good advice for any dealings
beyond the Two Rivers, but most especially with Aes Sedai. And with
Warders. Tell Lan something, and you&rsquo;ve as good as told Moiraine.
If he&rsquo;s a Warder, then he&rsquo;s bonded to her as sure as the sun rose
this morning, and he won&rsquo;t keep many secrets from her, if any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand knew little about the bonding between Aes Sedai and
Warders, though it played a big part in every story about Warders
he had ever heard. It was something to do with the Power, a gift to
the Warder, or maybe some sort of exchange. The Warders got all sorts of
benefits according to the stories.
They healed more quickly than other men, and could go longer
without food or water or sleep. Supposedly they could sense
Trollocs, if they were close enough, and other creatures of the
Dark One, too, which explained how Lan and Moiraine had tried to
warn the village before the attack. As to what the Aes Sedai got
out of it, the stories were silent, but he was not about to believe
they did not get something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be careful,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;I just wish I knew why. It
doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. Why me? Why us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew, too, boy. Blood and ashes, I wish I knew.&rdquo; Tam
sighed heavily. &ldquo;Well, no use trying to put a broken egg back in
the shell, I suppose. How soon do you have to go? I&rsquo;ll be back on
my feet in a day or two, and we can see about starting a new flock.
Oren Dautry has some good stock he might be willing to part with,
with the pastures all gone, and so does Jon Thane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moiraine&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the Aes Sedai said you had to stay in bed. She
said weeks.&rdquo; Tam opened his mouth, but Rand went on. &ldquo; And she
talked to Mistress al&rsquo;Vere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh. Well, maybe I can talk Marin around.&rdquo; Tam did not sound
hopeful of it, though. He gave Rand a sharp look. &ldquo;The way you
avoided answering means you have to leave soon. Tomorrow? Or
tonight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tonight,&rdquo; Rand said quietly, and Tam nodded sadly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Well, if it must be done, best not to delay. But we will
see about this &lsquo;weeks&rsquo; business.&rdquo; He plucked at his blankets with
more irritation than strength. &ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;ll follow in a few days
anyway. Catch you up on the road. We will see if Marin can keep me
in bed when I want to get up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a tap at the door, and Lan stuck his head into the
room. &ldquo;Say your goodbyes quickly, sheepherder, and come. There may
be trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trouble?&rdquo; Rand said, and the Warder growled at him
impatiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just hurry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hastily Rand snatched up his cloak. He started to
undo the sword belt, but Tam spoke up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep it. You will probably have more need of it than I, though,
the Light willing, neither of us will. Take care, lad. You
hear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ignoring Lan&rsquo;s continued growls, Rand bent to grab Tam in a hug.
&ldquo;I will come back. I promise you that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you will.&rdquo; Tam laughed. He returned the hug weakly,
and ended by patting Rand on the back. &ldquo;I know that. And I&rsquo;ll have
twice as many sheep for you to tend when you return. Now go, before
that fellow does himself an injury.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand tried to hang back, tried to find the words for the
question he did not want to ask, but Lan entered the room to catch
him by the arm and pull him into the hall. The Warder had donned a
dull gray-green tunic of overlapping metal scales. His voice rasped
with irritation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have to hurry. Don&rsquo;t you understand the word <em>trouble</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Outside the room Mat waited, cloaked and coated and carrying his
bow. A quiver hung at his waist. He was rocking anxiously on his
heels, and he kept glancing off toward the stairs with what seemed
to be equal parts impatience and fear. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t much like the stories,
Rand, is it?&rdquo; he said
hoarsely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of trouble?&rdquo; Rand demanded, but the Warder ran ahead
of him instead of answering, taking the steps down two at a time.
Mat dashed after him with quick gestures for Rand to follow.</p>

<p>Shrugging into his cloak, he caught up to them downstairs. Only
a feeble light filled the common room; half the candles had burned
out and most of the rest were guttering. It was empty except for
the three of them. Mat stood next to one of the front windows,
peeping out as if trying not to be seen. Lan held the door open a
crack and peered into the inn yard.</p>

<p>Wondering what they could be watching, Rand went to join him.
The Warder muttered at him to take a care, but he did open the door
a trifle wider to make room for Rand to look, too.</p>

<p>At first he was not sure exactly what he was seeing. A crowd of
village men, some three dozen or so, clustered near the burned-out
husk of the peddler&rsquo;s wagon, night pushed back by the torches some
of them carried. Moiraine faced them, her back to the inn, leaning
with seeming casualness on her walking staff. Hari Coplin stood in
the front of the crowd with his brother, Darl, and Bili Congar.
Cenn Buie was there, as well, looking uncomfortable. Rand was
startled to see Hari shake his fist at Moiraine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave Emond&rsquo;s Field!&rdquo; the sour-faced farmer shouted. A few
voices in the crowd echoed him, but hesitantly, and no one pushed
forward. They might be willing to confront an Aes Sedai from within
a crowd, but none of them wanted to be singled out. Not by an Aes
Sedai who had every reason to take offense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You brought those monsters!&rdquo; Darl roared. He waved a torch over
his head, and there were shouts of, &ldquo;You brought them!&rdquo; and &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
your fault!&rdquo; led by his cousin Bili.</p>

<p>Hari elbowed Cenn Buie, and the old thatcher pursed his lips and
gave him a sidelong glare. &ldquo;Those things&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;those Trollocs
didn&rsquo;t appear until after you came,&rdquo; Cenn muttered, barely loud
enough to be heard. He swung his head from side to side dourly as
if wishing he were somewhere else and looking for a way to get
there. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an Aes Sedai. We want none of your sort in the Two
Rivers. Aes Sedai bring trouble on their backs. If you stay, you
will only bring more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His speech brought no response from the gathered villagers, and
Hari scowled in frustration. Abruptly he snatched Darl&rsquo;s torch and
shook it in her direction. &ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Or we&rsquo;ll burn
you out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dead silence fell, except for the shuffling of a few feet as men
drew back. Two Rivers folk could fight back if they were attacked,
but violence was far from common, and threatening people was
foreign to them, beyond the occasional shaking of a fist. Cenn
Buie, Bili Congar, and the Coplins were left out front alone. Bili
looked as if he wanted to back away, too.</p>

<p>Hari gave an uneasy start at the lack of support, but he
recovered quickly. &ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; he shouted again, echoed by Darl and,
more weakly, by Bili. Hari glared at the others. Most of the crowd
failed to meet his eye.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bran al&rsquo;Vere and Haral Luhhan moved out of the shadows,
stopping apart from both the Aes Sedai and the crowd. In one hand
the Mayor casually carried the big wooden maul he used to drive
spigots into casks. &ldquo;Did someone suggest burning my inn?&rdquo; he asked
softly.</p>

<p>The two Coplins took a step back, and Cenn Buie edged away from
them. Bili Congar dived into the crowd. &ldquo;Not that,&rdquo; Darl said
quickly. &ldquo;We never said that, Bran&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ah, Mayor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bran nodded. &ldquo;Then perhaps I heard you threatening to harm
guests in my inn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s an Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Hari began angrily, but his words cut off
as Haral Luhhan moved.</p>

<p>The blacksmith simply stretched, thrusting thick arms over his
head, tightening massive fists until his knuckles cracked, but Hari
looked at the burly man as if one of those fists had been shaken
under his nose. Haral folded his arms across his chest. &ldquo;Your
pardon, Hari. I did not mean to cut you off. You were saying?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Hari, shoulders hunched as though he were trying to draw
into himself and disappear, seemed to have nothing more to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised at you people,&rdquo; Bran rumbled. &ldquo;Paet al&rsquo;Caar, your
boy&rsquo;s leg was broken last night, but I saw him walking on it today&mdash;because of her. Eward Candwin, you were lying on your belly
with a gash down your back like a fish for cleaning, till she laid
hands on you. Now it looks as if it happened a month ago, and
unless I misdoubt there&rsquo;ll barely be a scar. And you, Cenn.&rdquo; The
thatcher started to fade back into the crowd, but stopped, held
uncomfortably by Bran&rsquo;s gaze. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be shocked to see any man on the
Village Council here, Cenn, but you most of all. Your arm would
still be hanging useless at your side, a mass of burns and bruises,
if not for her. If you have no gratitude, have you no shame?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cenn half lifted his right hand, then looked away from it
angrily. &ldquo;I cannot deny what she did,&rdquo; he muttered, and he did
sound ashamed. &ldquo;She helped me, and others,&rdquo; he went on in a
pleading tone, &ldquo;but she&rsquo;s an Aes Sedai, Bran. If those Trollocs
didn&rsquo;t come because of her, why did they come? We want no part of
Aes Sedai in the Two Rivers. Let them keep their troubles away from
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few men, safely back in the crowd, shouted then. &ldquo;We want no
Aes Sedai troubles!&rdquo; &ldquo;Send her away!&rdquo; &ldquo;Drive her out!&rdquo; &ldquo;Why did they
come if not because of her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A scowl grew on Bran&rsquo;s face, but before he could speak Moiraine
suddenly whirled her vine-carved staff above her head, spinning it
with both hands. Rand&rsquo;s gasp echoed that of the villagers, for a
hissing white flame flared from each end of the staff, standing
straight out like spearpoints despite the rod&rsquo;s whirling. Even Bran
and Haral edged away from her. She snapped her arms down straight
out before her, the staff parallel to the ground, but the pale fire
still jetted out, brighter than the torches. Men shied away, held
up hands to shield their eyes from the pain of that brilliance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this what Aemon&rsquo;s blood has come to?&rdquo; The Aes Sedai&rsquo;s voice
was not loud, but it overwhelmed every other sound. &ldquo;Little people
squabbling for the right to hide like rabbits?
You have forgotten who you were, forgotten what you were, but I had
hoped some small part was left, some memory in blood and bone. Some
shred to steel you for the long night coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one spoke. The two Coplins looked as if they never wanted to
open their mouths again.</p>

<p>Bran said, &ldquo;Forgotten who we were? We are who we always have
been. Honest farmers and shepherds and craftsmen. Two Rivers folk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the south,&rdquo; Moiraine said, &ldquo;lies the river you call the
White River, but far to the east of here men call it still by its
rightful name. Manetherendrelle. In the Old Tongue, Waters of the
Mountain Home. Sparkling waters that once coursed through a land of
bravery and beauty. Two thousand years ago Manetherendrelle flowed
by the walls of a mountain city so lovely to behold that Ogier
stonemasons came to stare in wonder. Farms and villages covered
this region, and what you call the Forest of Shadows, as well, and
beyond. But all of those folk thought of themselves as the people
of the Mountain Home, the people of Manetheren.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Their King was Aemon al Caar al Thorin, Aemon son of Caar son
of Thorin, and Eldrene ay Ellan ay Carlan was his Queen. Aemon, a
man so fearless that the greatest compliment for courage any could
give, even among his enemies, was to say a man had Aemon&rsquo;s heart.
Eldrene, so beautiful that it was said the flowers bloomed to make
her smile. Bravery and beauty and wisdom and a love that death
could not sunder. Weep, if you have a heart, for the loss of them,
for the loss of even their memory. Weep, for the loss of their
blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She fell silent then, but no one spoke. Rand was as bound as the
others in the spell she had created. When she spoke again, he drank
it in, and so did the rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For nearly two centuries the Trolloc Wars had ravaged the
length and breadth of the world, and wherever battles raged, the
Red Eagle banner of Manetheren was in the forefront. The men of
Manetheren were a thorn to the Dark One&rsquo;s foot and a bramble to his
hand. Sing of Manetheren, that would never bend knee to the Shadow.
Sing of Manetheren, the sword that could not be broken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were far away, the men of Manetheren, on the Field of
Bekkar, called the Field of Blood, when news came that a Trolloc
army was moving against their home. Too far to do else but wait to
hear of their land&rsquo;s death, for the forces of the Dark One meant to
make an end of them. Kill the mighty oak by hacking away its roots.
Too far to do else but mourn. But they were the men of the Mountain
Home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without hesitation, without thought for the distance they must
travel, they marched from the very field of victory, still covered
in dust and sweat and blood. Day and night they marched, for they
had seen the horror a Trolloc army left behind it, and no man of
them could sleep while such a danger threatened Manetheren. They
moved as if their feet had wings, marching further and faster than
friends hoped or enemies feared they could. At any other day that
march alone would have inspired songs. When the Dark One&rsquo;s armies
swooped down upon the lands of Manetheren, the men of the Mountain
Home stood before it, with their backs to the Tarendrelle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some villager raised a small cheer then, but Moiraine kept on as
if she had not heard. &ldquo;The host that faced the men of Manetheren
was enough to daunt the bravest heart. Ravens blackened the sky;
Trollocs blackened the land. Trollocs and their human allies.
Trollocs and Darkfriends in tens of tens of thousands, and
Dreadlords to command. At night their cookfires outnumbered the
stars, and dawn revealed the banner of Ba&rsquo;alzamon at their head.
Ba&rsquo;alzamon, Heart of the Dark. An ancient name for the Father of
Lies. The Dark One could not have been free of his prison at Shayol
Ghul, for if he had been, not all the forces of humankind together
could have stood against him, but there was power there.
Dreadlords, and some evil that made that light-destroying banner
seem no more than right and sent a chill into the souls of the men
who faced it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet, they knew what they must do. Their homeland lay just
across the river. They must keep that host, and the power with it,
from the Mountain Home. Aemon had sent out messengers. Aid was
promised if they could hold for but three days at the Tarendrelle.
Hold for three days against odds that should overwhelm them in the
first hour. Yet somehow, through bloody assault and desperate
defense, they held through an hour, and the second hour, and the
third. For three days they fought, and though the land became a
butcher&rsquo;s yard, no crossing of the Tarendrelle did they yield. By
the third night no help had come, and no messengers, and they
fought on alone. For six days. For nine. And on the tenth day Aemon
knew the bitter taste of betrayal. No help was coming, and they
could hold the river crossings no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did they do?&rdquo; Hari demanded. Torchfires flickered in the
chill night breeze, but no one made a move to draw a cloak
tighter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aemon crossed the Tarendrelle,&rdquo; Moiraine told them, &ldquo;destroying
the bridges behind him. And he sent word throughout his land for
the people to flee, for he knew the powers with the Trolloc horde
would find a way to bring it across the river. Even as the word
went out, the Trolloc crossing began, and the soldiers of
Manetheren took up the fight again, to buy with their lives what
hours they could for their people to escape. From the city of
Manetheren, Eldrene organized the flight of her people into the
deepest forests and the fastness of the mountains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But some did not flee. First in a trickle, then a river, then a
flood, men went, not to safety, but to join the army fighting for
their land. Shepherds with bows, and farmers with pitchforks, and
woodsmen with axes. Women went, too, shouldering what weapons they
could find and marching side by side with their men. No one made
that journey who did not know they would never return. But it was
their land. It had been their fathers&rsquo;, and it would be their
children&rsquo;s, and they went to pay the price of it. Not a step of
ground was given up until it was soaked in blood, but at the last
the army of Manetheren was driven back, back to here, to this place
you now call Emond&rsquo;s Field. And here the Trolloc hordes surrounded
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her voice held the sound of cold tears. &ldquo;Trolloc dead and
the corpses of human renegades piled up in mounds, but always more
scrambled over those charnel heaps in waves of death that had no
end. There could be but one finish. No man or woman who had stood
beneath the banner of the Red Eagle at that day&rsquo;s dawning still
lived when night fell. The sword that could not be broken was
shattered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the Mountains of Mist, alone in the emptied city of
Manetheren, Eldrene felt Aemon die, and her heart died with him.
And where her heart had been was left only a thirst for vengeance,
vengeance for her love, vengeance for her people and her land.
Driven by grief she reached out to the True Source, and hurled the
One Power at the Trolloc army. And there the Dreadlords died
wherever they stood, whether in their secret councils or exhorting
their soldiers. In the passing of a breath the Dreadlords and the
generals of the Dark One&rsquo;s host burst into flame. Fire consumed
their bodies, and terror consumed their just-victorious army.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now they ran like beasts before a wildfire in the forest, with
no thought for anything but escape. North and south they fled.
Thousands drowned attempting to cross the Tarendrelle without the
aid of the Dreadlords, and at the Manetherendrelle they tore down
the bridges in their fright at what might be following them. Where
they found people, they slew and burned, but to flee was the need
that gripped them. Until, at last, no one of them remained in the
lands of Manetheren. They were dispersed like dust before the
whirlwind. The final vengeance came more slowly, but it came, when
they were hunted down by other peoples, by other armies in other
lands. None was left alive of those who did murder at Aemon&rsquo;s
Field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the price was high for Manetheren. Eldrene had drawn to
herself more of the One Power than any human could ever hope to
wield unaided. As the enemy generals died, so did she die, and the
fires that consumed her consumed the empty city of Manetheren, even
the stones of it, down to the living rock of the mountains. Yet the
people had been saved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing was left of their farms, their villages, or their great
city. Some would say there was nothing left for them, nothing but
to flee to other lands, where they could begin anew. They did not
say so. They had paid such a price in blood and hope for their land
as had never been paid before, and now they were bound to that soil
by ties stronger than steel. Other wars would wrack them in years
to come, until at last their corner of the world was forgotten and
at last they had forgotten wars and the ways of war. Never again
did Manetheren rise. Its soaring spires and splashing fountains
became as a dream that slowly faded from the minds of its people.
But they, and their children, and their children&rsquo;s children, held
the land that was theirs. They held it when the long centuries had
washed the why of it from their memories. They held it until,
today, there is you. Weep for Manetheren. Weep for what is lost
forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fires on Moiraine&rsquo;s staff winked out, and she lowered it to
her side as if it weighed a hundred pounds. For a long moment the
moan of the wind was the only sound. Then Paet al&rsquo;Caar shouldered
past the Coplins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about your story,&rdquo; the long-jawed farmer said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no thorn to the Dark One&rsquo;s foot, nor ever likely to be,
neither. But my Wil is walking because of you, and for that I am
ashamed to be here. I don&rsquo;t know if you can forgive me, but whether
you will or no, I&rsquo;ll be going. And for me, you can stay in Emond&rsquo;s
Field as long as you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a quick duck of his head, almost a bow, he pushed back
through the crowd. Others began to mutter then, offering shamefaced
penitence before they, too, slipped away one by one. The Coplins,
sour-mouthed and scowling once more, looked at the faces around
them and vanished into the night without a word. Bili Congar had
disappeared even before his cousins.</p>

<p>Lan pulled Rand back and shut the door. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, boy.&rdquo; The
Warder started for the back of the inn. &ldquo;Come along, both of you.
Quickly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand hesitated, exchanging a wondering glance with Mat.
While Moiraine had been telling the story, Master al&rsquo;Vere&rsquo;s
Dhurrans could not have dragged him away, but now something else
held his feet. This was the real beginning, leaving the inn and
following the Warder into the night. He shook himself, and tried to
firm his resolve. He had no choice but to go, but he would come
back to Emond&rsquo;s Field, however far or long this journey was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you waiting for?&rdquo; Lan asked from the door that led out
of the back of the common room. With a start Mat hurried to
him.</p>

<p>Trying to convince himself that he was beginning a grand
adventure, Rand followed them through the darkened kitchen out into
the stableyard.</p>
