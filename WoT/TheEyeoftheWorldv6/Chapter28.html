stared in wonder at what lay ahead down the
river, the White Bridge gleaming in the sun with a milky glow.
<em>Another legend</em>, she thought, glancing at the Warder and the Aes

demanding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I have told you,&rdquo; Moiraine replied without
bothering to look back at her, &ldquo;I will know when I am close to the
two who have lost their coins.&rdquo; It was not the first time Nynaeve
had asked, but the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s voice was like a still pond that
