a small copse of trees, beneath a pile of cedar branches
roughly cut in the dark, Perrin slept long after sunrise. It was
the cedar needles, pricking him through his still-damp clothes,
that finally pricked through his exhaustion as well. Deep in a
dream of Emond&rsquo;s Field, of working at Master Luhhan&rsquo;s forge, he
opened his eyes and stared, uncomprehending, at the sweet-smelling
branches interwoven over his face, sunlight trickling through.</p>

<p>The cutting wind of the night before had faded to a silent
breeze that barely rippled the surface of the water. The river ran
by, calm and empty. And wide. Surely too wide and too deep for
Fades to cross. The far bank appea
