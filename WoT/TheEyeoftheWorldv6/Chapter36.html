Gill took them to a corner table in the common
room and had one of the serving maids bring them food. Rand shook
his head when he saw the plates, with a few thin slices of
gravy-covered beef, a spoonful of mustard greens, and two potatoes
on each. It was a rueful, resigned headshake, though, not angry.
Not enough of anything, the innkeeper had said. Picking up his
knife and fork, Rand wondered what would happen when there was
nothing left. It made his half-covered plate seem like a feast. It
made him shiver.</p>

<p>Master Gill had chosen a table well away from anyone
else, and he sat with his back to the corner, where he could watch
the room. Nobody could get close enough to overhear what they said
without him seeing. When the maid left, he said softly, &ldquo;Now, why
don&rsquo;t you tell me about this trouble of yours? If I&rsquo;m going to
help, I&rsquo;d best know what I&rsquo;m getting into.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand looked at Mat, but Mat was frowning at his plate
as if he were mad at the potato he was cutting. Rand took a deep
breath. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really understand it myself,&rdquo; he began.</p>

<p>He kept the story simple, and he kept Trollocs and
Fades out of it. When somebody offered help, it would not do to
tell them it was all about fables. But he did not think it was fair
to understate the danger, either, not fair to pull someone in when
they had no idea what they were getting into. Some men were after
him and Mat, and a couple of friends of theirs, too. They appeared
where they were least expected, these men, and they were deadly
dangerous and set on killing him and his friends, or worse.
Moiraine said some of them were Darkfriends. Thom did not trust
Moiraine completely, but he stayed on with them, he said, because
of his nephew. They had been separated during an attack while
trying to reach Whitebridge, and then, in Whitebridge, Thom died
saving them from another attack. And there had been other tries. He
knew there were holes in it, but it was the best he could do on
short notice without telling more than was safe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We just kept on till we reached Caemlyn,&rdquo; he
explained. &ldquo;That was the plan, originally. Caemlyn, and then Tar
Valon.&rdquo; He shifted uncomfortably on the edge of his chair. After
keeping everything secret for so long, it felt odd to be telling
somebody even as much as he was. &ldquo;If we stay on that route, the
others will be able to find us, sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;re alive,&rdquo; Mat muttered at his plate.</p>

<p>Rand did not even glance at Mat. Something compelled
him to add, &ldquo;It could bring you trouble, helping us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master Gill waved it off with a plump hand. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
say as I want trouble, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be the first I&rsquo;ve seen. No
bloody Darkfriend will make me turn my back on Thom&rsquo;s friends. This
friend of yours from up north, now&mdash;if she comes to Caemlyn,
I&rsquo;ll hear. There are people keep their eyes on comings and goings
like that around here, and word spreads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand hesitated, then asked, &ldquo;What about Elaida?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The innkeeper hesitated too, and finally shook his
head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. Maybe if you didn&rsquo;t have a connection to
Thom. She&rsquo;d winkle it out, and then where would you be? No telling.
Maybe in a cell. Maybe worse. They say she has a way of feeling
things, what&rsquo;s happened, what&rsquo;s going to happen. They say she can
cut right through to what a man wants to hide. I don&rsquo;t know, but I
wouldn&rsquo;t risk it. If it wasn&rsquo;t for Thom, you could go to the
Guards. They&rsquo;d take care of any Darkfriends quick enough. But even
if you could keep Thom quiet from the Guards, word would reach
Elaida as soon as you mentioned Darkfriends, and then you&rsquo;re back
where we started.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No Guards,&rdquo; Rand agreed. Mat nodded vigorously while
stuffing a fork into his mouth and got gravy on his chin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trouble is, you&rsquo;re caught up in the fringes of
politics, lad, even if it&rsquo;s none of your doing, and politics is a
foggy mire full of snakes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about&mdash;&rdquo; Rand began, but the innkeeper
grimaced suddenly, his chair creaking under his bulk as he sat up
straight.</p>

<p>The cook was standing in the doorway to the kitchen,
wiping her hands with her apron. When she saw the innkeeper looking
she motioned for him to come, then vanished back into the
kitchen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Might as well be married to her.&rdquo; Master Gill
sighed. &ldquo;Finds things that need fixing before I know there&rsquo;s
anything wrong. If it&rsquo;s not the drains stopped up, or the
downspouts clogged, it&rsquo;s rats. I keep a clean place, you
understand, but with so many people in the city, rats are
everywhere. Crowd people together and you get rats, and Caemlyn has
a plague of them all of a sudden. You wouldn&rsquo;t believe what a good
cat, a prime ratter, fetches these days. Your room is in the attic.
I&rsquo;ll tell the girls which; any of them can show you to it. And
don&rsquo;t worry about Darkfriends. I can&rsquo;t say much good about the
Whitecloaks, but between them and the Guards, that sort won&rsquo;t dare
show their filthy faces in Caemlyn.&rdquo; His chair squeaked again as he
pushed it back and stood. &ldquo;I hope it isn&rsquo;t the drains again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand went back to his food, but he saw that Mat had
stopped eating. &ldquo;I thought you were hungry,&rdquo; he said. Mat kept
staring at his plate, pushing one piece of potato in a circle with
his fork. &ldquo;You have to eat, Mat. We need to keep up our strength if
we&rsquo;re going to reach Tar Valon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat let out a low, bitter laugh. &ldquo;Tar Valon! All this
time it&rsquo;s been Caemlyn. Moiraine would be waiting for us in
Caemlyn. We&rsquo;d find Perrin and Egwene in Caemlyn. Everything would
be all right if we only got to Caemlyn. Well, here we are, and
nothing&rsquo;s right. No Moiraine, no Perrin, no anybody. Now it&rsquo;s
everything will be all right if we only get to Tar Valon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re alive,&rdquo; Rand said, more sharply than he had
intended. He took a deep breath and tried to moderate his tone. &ldquo;We
are alive. That much is all right. And I intend to stay alive. I
intend to find out why we&rsquo;re so important. I won&rsquo;t give up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All these people, and any of them could be
Darkfriends. Master Gill promised to help us awfully quick. What
kind of man just shrugs off Aes Sedai and Darkfriends? It isn&rsquo;t
natural. Any decent person would tell us to get out, or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;or something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eat,&rdquo; Rand said gently, and watched until Mat began
chewing a piece of beef.</p>

<p>He left his own hands resting beside his plate for a
minute, pressing them against the table to keep them from shaking.
He was scared. Not about Master Gill, of course, but there was
enough without that. Those tall city walls would not stop a Fade.
Maybe he should tell the innkeeper about that. But even if Gill
believed, would he be as willing to help if he thought a Fade might
show up at The Queen&rsquo;s Blessing? And the rats. Maybe rats did
thrive where there were a lot of people, but he remembered the
dream that was not a dream in Baerlon, and a small spine snapping.
<em>Sometimes the Dark One uses carrion eaters as his eyes</em>,
Lan had said. <em>Ravens, crows, rats</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He ate, but when he was done he could not remember
tasting a single bite.</p>

<p>A serving maid, the one who had been polishing
candlesticks when they came in, showed them up to the attic room. A
dormer window pierced the slanting outer wall, with a bed on either
side of it and pegs beside the door for hanging their belongings.
The dark-eyed girl had a tendency to twist her skirt and giggle
whenever she looked at Rand. She was pretty, but he knew if he said
anything to her he would just make a fool of himself. She made him
wish he had Perrin&rsquo;s way with girls; he was glad when she left.</p>

<p>He expected some comment from Mat, but as soon as she
was gone, Mat threw himself on one of the beds, still in his cloak
and boots, and turned his face to the wall.</p>

<p>Rand hung his things up, watching Mat&rsquo;s back. He
thought Mat had his hand under his coat, clutching that dagger
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You just going to lie up here hiding?&rdquo; he said
finally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired,&rdquo; Mat mumbled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have questions to ask Master Gill, yet. He might
even be able to tell us how to find Egwene, and Perrin. They could
be in Caemlyn already if they managed to hang onto their
horses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re dead,&rdquo; Mat said to the wall.</p>

<p>Rand hesitated, then gave up. He closed the door
softly behind him, hoping Mat really would sleep.</p>

<p>Downstairs, however, Master Gill was nowhere to be
found, though the sharp look in the cook&rsquo;s eye said she was looking
for him, too. For a while Rand sat in the common room, but he found
himself eyeing every patron who came in, every stranger who could
be anyone&mdash;or anything&mdash;especially in the moment when he was
first silhouetted as a cloaked black shape in the doorway. A Fade
in the room would be like a fox in a chicken coop.</p>

<p>A Guardsman entered from the street. The
red-uniformed man stopped just inside the door, running a cool eye
over those in the room who were obviously from outside the city.
Rand studied the tabletop when the Guardsman&rsquo;s eyes fell on him;
when he looked up again, the man was gone.</p>

<p>The dark-eyed maid was passing with her arms full of
towels. &ldquo;They do that sometimes,&rdquo; she said in a confiding tone as
she went by. &ldquo;Just to see there&rsquo;s no trouble. They look after good
Queen&rsquo;s folk, they do. Nothing for you to worry about.&rdquo; She
giggled.</p>

<p>Rand shook his head. Nothing for him to worry about.
It was not as if the Guardsman would have come over and demanded to
know if he knew Thom Merrilin. He was getting as bad as Mat. He
scraped back his chair.</p>

<p>Another maid was checking the oil in the lamps along
the wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there another room where I could sit?&rdquo; he asked
her. He did not want to go back upstairs and shut himself up with
Mat&rsquo;s sullen withdrawal. &ldquo;Maybe a private dining room that&rsquo;s not
being used?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the library.&rdquo; She pointed to a door.
&ldquo;Through there, to your right, at the end of the hall. Might be
empty, this hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you. If you see Master Gill, would you tell
him Rand al&rsquo;Thor needs to talk to him if he can spare a
minute?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him,&rdquo; she said, then grinned. &ldquo;Cook wants
to talk to him, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The innkeeper was probably hiding, he thought as he
turned away from her.</p>

<p>When he stepped into the room to which she had
directed him, he stopped and stared. The shelves must have held
three or four hundred books, more than he had ever seen in one
place before. Clothbound, leather-bound with gilded spines. Only a
few had wooden covers. His eyes gobbled up the titles, picking out
old favorites. <em>The Travels of Jain Farstrider</em>. <em>The
Essays of Willim of Maneches</em>. His breath caught at the sight
of a leather bound copy of <em>Voyager Among the Sea Folk</em>. Tam
had always wanted to read that.</p>

<p>Picturing Tam, turning the book over in his hands
with a smile, getting the feel of it before settling down before
the fireplace with his pipe to read, his own hand tightened on his
sword hilt with a sense of loss and emptiness that dampened all his
pleasure in the books.</p>

<p>A throat cleared behind him, and he suddenly realized
he was not alone. Ready to apologize for his rudeness, he turned.
He was used to being taller than almost everyone he met, but this
time his eyes traveled up and up and up, and his mouth fell open.
Then he came to the head almost reaching the ten-foot ceiling. A
nose as broad as the face, so wide it was more a snout than a nose.
Eyebrows that hung down like tails, framing pale eyes as big as
teacups. Ears that poked up to tufted points through a shaggy,
black mane. <em>Trolloc!</em> He let out a yell and tried to back
up and draw his sword. His feet got tangled, and he sat down hard,
instead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you humans wouldn&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; rumbled a voice
as deep as a drum. The tufted ears twitched violently, and the
voice became sad. &ldquo;So few of you remember us. It&rsquo;s our own fault, I
suppose. Not many of us have gone out among men since the Shadow
fell on the Ways. That&rsquo;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;oh, six generations, now. Right
after the War of the Hundred Years, it was.&rdquo; The shaggy head shook
and let out a sigh that would have done credit to a bull. &ldquo;Too
long, too long, and so few to travel and see, it might as well have
been none.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand sat there for a minute with his mouth hanging
open, staring up at the apparition in wide-toed, knee-high boots
and a dark blue coat that buttoned from the neck to the waist, then
flared out to his boot tops like a kilt over baggy trousers. In one
hand was a book, seeming tiny by comparison, with a finger broad
enough for three marking the place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you were&mdash;&rdquo; he began, then caught
himself. &ldquo;What are&mdash;?&rdquo; That was not any better. Getting to
his feet, he gingerly offered his hand. &ldquo;My name is Rand
al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A hand as big as a ham engulfed his; it was
accompanied by a formal bow. &ldquo;Loial, son of Arent son of Halan.
Your name sings in my ears, Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That sounded like a ritual greeting to Rand. He
returned the bow. &ldquo;Your name sings in my ears, Loial, son of Arent&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;son of Halan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was all a little unreal. He still did not know
what Loial was. The grip of Loial&rsquo;s huge fingers was surprisingly
gentle, but he was still relieved to get his hand back in one
piece.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You humans are very excitable,&rdquo; Loial said in that
bass rumble. &ldquo;I had heard all the stories, and read the books, of
course, but I didn&rsquo;t realize. My first day in Caemlyn, I could not
believe the uproar. Children cried, and women screamed, and a mob
chased me all the way across the city, waving clubs and knives and
torches, and shouting, &lsquo;Trolloc!&rsquo; I&rsquo;m afraid I was almost beginning
to get a little upset. There&rsquo;s no telling what would have happened
if a party of the Queen&rsquo;s Guards hadn&rsquo;t come along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lucky thing,&rdquo; Rand said faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but even the Guardsmen seemed almost as afraid
of me as the others. Four days in Caemlyn now, and I haven&rsquo;t been
able to put my nose outside this inn. Good Master Gill even asked
me not to use the common room.&rdquo; His ears twitched. &ldquo;Not that he
hasn&rsquo;t been very hospitable, you understand. But there was a bit of
trouble that first night. All the humans seemed to want to leave at
once. Such screaming and shouting, everyone trying to get through
the door at the same time. Some of them could have been hurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stared in fascination at those twitching
ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, it was not for this I left the
<em>stedding</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an Ogier!&rdquo; Rand exclaimed. &ldquo;Wait! Six
generations? You said the War of the Hundred Years! How old are
you?&rdquo; He knew it was rude as soon as he said it, but Loial became
defensive rather than offended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ninety years,&rdquo; the Ogier said stiffly. &ldquo;In only ten
more I&rsquo;ll be able to address the Stump. I think the Elders should
have let me speak, since they were deciding whether I could leave
or not. But then they always worry about anyone of any age going
Outside. You humans are so hasty, so erratic.&rdquo; He blinked and gave
a short bow. &ldquo;Please forgive me. I shouldn&rsquo;t have said that. But
you do fight all the time, even when there&rsquo;s no need to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Rand said. He was still trying to
take in Loial&rsquo;s age. Older than old Cenn Buie, and still not old
enough to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He sat down in one of the high-backed chairs. Loial
took another, made to hold two; he filled it. Sitting, he was as
tall as most men standing. &ldquo;At least they did let you go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial looked at the floor, wrinkling his nose and
rubbing at it with one thick finger. &ldquo;Well, as to that, now. You
see, the Stump had not been meeting very long, not even a year, but
I could tell from what I heard that by the time they reached a
decision I would be old enough to go without their permission. I am
afraid they&rsquo;ll say I put a long handle on my axe, but I just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;left. The Elders always said I was too hot-headed, and I fear I&rsquo;ve
proven them right. I wonder if they have realized I&rsquo;m gone, yet?
But I had to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand bit his lip to keep from laughing. If Loial was
a hot-headed Ogier, he could imagine what most Ogier were like. Had
not been meeting very long, not even a year? Master al&rsquo;Vere would
just shake his head in wonder; a Village Council meeting that
lasted half a day would have everybody jumping up and down, even
Haral Luhhan. A wave of homesickness swept over him, making it hard
to breathe for memories of Tam, and Egwene, and the Winespring Inn,
and Bel Tine on the Green in happier days. He forced them away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind my asking,&rdquo; he said, clearing his
throat, &ldquo;why did you want to go&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ah, Outside, so much? I wish
I&rsquo;d never left my home, myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, to see,&rdquo; Loial said as if it were the most
obvious thing in the world. &ldquo;I read the books, all the travelers&rsquo;
accounts, and it began to burn in me that I had to see, not just
read.&rdquo; His pale eyes brightened, and his ears stiffened. &ldquo;I studied
every scrap I could find about traveling, about the Ways, and
customs in human lands, and the cities we built for you humans
after the Breaking of the World. And the more I read, the more I
knew that I had to go Outside, go to those places we had been, and
see the groves for myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand blinked. &ldquo;Groves?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the groves. The trees. Only a few of the Great
Trees, of course, towering to the sky to keep memories of the
<em>stedding</em> fresh.&rdquo; His chair groaned as he shifted forward,
gesturing with his hands, one of which still held the book. His
eyes were brighter than ever, and his ears almost quivered. &ldquo;Mostly
they used the trees of the land and the place. You cannot make the
land go against itself. Not for long; the land will rebel. You must
shape the vision to the land, not the land to the vision. In every
grove was planted every tree that would grow and thrive in that
place, each balanced against the next, each placed to complement
the others, for the best growing, of course, but also so that the
balance would sing in the eye and the heart. Ah, the books spoke of
groves to make Elders weep and laugh at the same time, groves to
remain green in memory forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about the cities?&rdquo; Rand asked. Loial gave him a
puzzled look. &ldquo;The cities. The cities the Ogier built. Here, for
instance. Caemlyn. Ogier built Caemlyn, didn&rsquo;t you? The stories say
so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Working with stone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; His shoulders gave a
massive shrug. &ldquo;That was just something learned in the years after
the Breaking, during the Exile, when we were still trying to find
the <em>stedding</em> again. It is a fine thing, I suppose, but not
the true thing. Try as you will&mdash;and I have read that the
Ogier who built those cities truly did try&mdash;you cannot make
stone live. A few still do work with stone, but only because you
humans damage the buildings so often with your wars. There were a
handful of Ogier in&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Cairhien, it&rsquo;s called now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;when I passed through. They were from another <em>stedding</em>,
luckily, so they didn&rsquo;t know about me, but they were still
suspicious that I was Outside alone so young. I suppose it&rsquo;s just
as well there was no reason for me to linger there. In any case,
you see, working with stone is just something that was thrust on us
by the weaving of the Pattern; the groves came from the heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shook his head. Half the stories he had grown up
with had just been stood on their heads. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know Ogier
believed in the Pattern, Loial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, we believe. The Wheel of Time weaves the
Pattern of the Ages, and lives are the threads it weaves. No one
can tell how the thread of his own life will be woven into the
Pattern, or how the thread of a people will be woven. It gave us
the Breaking of the World, and the Exile, and Stone, and the
Longing, and eventually it gave us back the <em>stedding</em>
before we all died. Sometimes I think the reason you humans are the
way you are is because your threads are so short. They must jump
around in the weaving. Oh, there, I&rsquo;ve done it again. The Elders
say you humans don&rsquo;t like to be reminded of how short a time you
live. I hope I didn&rsquo;t hurt your feelings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand laughed and shook his head. &ldquo;Not at all. I
suppose it&rsquo;d be fun to live as long as you do, but I never really
thought about it. I guess if I live as long as old Cenn Buie,
that&rsquo;ll be long enough for anybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a very old man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand just nodded. He was not about to explain that
old Cenn Buie was not quite as old as Loial.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Loial said, &ldquo;perhaps you humans do have short
lives, but you do so much with them, always jumping around, always
so hasty. And you have the whole world to do it in. We Ogier are
bound to our <em>stedding</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Outside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For a time, Rand. But I must go back, eventually.
This world is yours, yours and your kind&rsquo;s. The <em>stedding</em>
are mine. There&rsquo;s too much hurly-burly Outside. And so much is
changed from what I read about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, things do change over the years. Some,
anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some? Half the cities I read about aren&rsquo;t even there
any longer, and most of the rest are known by different names. You
take Cairhien. The city&rsquo;s proper name is Al&rsquo;cair&rsquo;rahienallen, Hill
of the Golden Dawn. They don&rsquo;t even remember, for all of the
sunrise on their banners. And the grove there. I doubt if it has
been tended since the Trolloc Wars. It&rsquo;s just another forest, now,
where they cut firewood. The Great Trees are all gone, and no one
remembers them. And here? Caemlyn is still Caemlyn, but they let
the city grow right over the grove. We&rsquo;re not a quarter of a mile
from the center of it right where we sit&mdash;from where the center of
it should be. Not a tree of it left. I&rsquo;ve been to Tear and Illian,
too. Different names, and no memories. There&rsquo;s only pasture for
their horses where the grove was at Tear, and at Illian the grove
is the King&rsquo;s park, where he hunts his deer, and none allowed
inside without his permission. It has all changed, Rand. I fear
very much that I will find the same everywhere I go. All the groves
gone, all the memories gone, all the dreams dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t give up, Loial. You can&rsquo;t ever give up. If
you give up, you might as well be dead.&rdquo; Rand sank back in his
chair as far as he could go, his face turning red. He expected the
Ogier to laugh at him, but Loial nodded gravely instead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the way of your kind, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; The
Ogier&rsquo;s voice changed, as if he were quoting something. &ldquo;Till shade
is gone, till water is gone, into the Shadow with teeth bared,
screaming defiance with the last breath, to spit in Sightblinder&rsquo;s
eye on the Last Day.&rdquo; Loial cocked his shaggy head expectantly, but
Rand had no idea what it was he expected.</p>

<p>A minute went by with Loial waiting, then another,
and his long eyebrows began to draw down in puzzlement. But he
still waited, the silence growing uncomfortable for Rand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Great Trees,&rdquo; Rand said finally, just for
something to break that silence. &ldquo;Are they like
<em>Avendesora</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial sat up sharply; his chair squealed and cracked
so loudly Rand thought it was going to come apart. &ldquo;You know better
than that. You, of all people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me? How would I know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you playing a joke on me? Sometimes you Aielmen
think the oddest things are funny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? I&rsquo;m not an Aielman! I&rsquo;m from the Two Rivers. I
never even saw an Aielman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial shook his head, and the tufts on his ears
drooped outward. &ldquo;You see? Everything is changed, and half of what
I know is useless. I hope I did not offend you. I&rsquo;m sure your Two
Rivers is a very fine place, wherever it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody told me,&rdquo; Rand said, &ldquo;that it was once
called Manetheren. I&rsquo;d never heard it, but maybe you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Ogier&rsquo;s ears had perked up happily. &ldquo;Ah! Yes.
Manetheren.&rdquo; The tufts went down again. &ldquo;There was a very fine
grove there. Your pain sings in my heart, Rand al&rsquo;Thor. We could
not come in time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial bowed where he sat, and Rand bowed back. He
suspected Loial would be hurt if he did not, would think he was
rude at the least. He wondered if Loial thought he had the same
sort of memories the Ogier seemed to. The corners of Loial&rsquo;s mouth
and eyes were certainly turned down as if he were sharing the pain
of Rand&rsquo;s loss, just as if the destruction of Manetheren were not
something that happened two thousand years ago, near enough,
something that Rand only knew about because of Moiraine&rsquo;s
story.</p>

<p>After a time Loial sighed. &ldquo;The Wheel turns,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;and no one knows its turning. But you have come almost as
far from your home as I have. A very considerable distance, as
things are now. When the Ways were freely open, of course&mdash;but that is long past. Tell me, what brings you so far? Is there
something you want to see, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand opened his mouth to say that they had come to
see the false Dragon&mdash;and he could not say it. Perhaps it was
because Loial acted as if he were no older than Rand, ninety years
old or no ninety years old. Maybe for an Ogier ninety years was not
any older than he was. It had been a long time since he had been
able to really talk to anyone about what was happening. Always the
fear that they might be Darkfriends, or think he was. Mat was so
drawn in on himself, feeding his fears on his own suspicions, that
he was no good for talking. Rand found himself telling Loial about
Winternight. Not a vague story about Darkfriends; the truth about
Trollocs breaking in the door, and a Fade on the Quarry Road.</p>

<p>Part of him was horrified at what he was doing, but
it was almost as if he were two people, one trying to hold his
tongue while the other only felt the relief at being able to tell
it all finally. The result was that he stumbled and stuttered and
jumped around in the story. Shadar Logoth and losing his friends in
the night, not knowing if they were alive or dead. The Fade in
Whitebridge; and Thom dying so they could escape. The Fade in
Baerlon. Darkfriends later, Howal Gode, and the boy who was afraid
of them, and the woman who tried to kill Mat. The Halfman outside
the Goose and Crown.</p>

<p>When he started babbling about dreams, even the part
of him that wanted to talk felt the hackles rising on the back of
his neck. He bit his tongue clamping his teeth shut. Breathing
heavily through his nose, he watched the Ogier warily, hoping he
thought he had meant nightmares. The Light knew it all sounded like
a nightmare, or enough to give anyone nightmares. Maybe Loial would
just think he was going mad. Maybe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Ta&rsquo;veren</em>,&rdquo; Loial said.</p>

<p>Rand blinked. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Ta&rsquo;veren</em>.&rdquo; Loial rubbed behind a pointed
ear with one blunt finger and gave a little shrug. &ldquo;Elder Haman
always said I never listened, but sometimes I did. Sometimes, I
listened. You know how the Pattern is woven, of course?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never really thought about it,&rdquo; he said slowly.
&ldquo;It just is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um, yes, well. Not exactly. You see, the Wheel of
Time weaves the Pattern of the Ages, and the threads it uses are
lives. It is not fixed, the Pattern, not always. If a man tries to
change the direction of his life and the Pattern has room for it,
the Wheel just weaves on and takes it in. There is always room for
small changes, but sometimes the Pattern simply won&rsquo;t accept a big
change, no matter how hard you try. You understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand nodded. &ldquo;I could live on the farm or in Emond&rsquo;s
Field, and that would be a small change. If I wanted to be a king,
though&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He laughed, and Loial gave a grin that almost split
his face in two. His teeth were white, and as broad as chisels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it. But sometimes the change chooses
you, or the Wheel chooses it for you. And sometimes the Wheel bends
a life-thread, or several threads, in such a way that all the
surrounding threads are forced to swirl around it, and those force
other threads, and those still others, and on and on. That first
bending to make the Web, that is <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, and there is
nothing you can do to change it, not until the Pattern itself
changes. The Web&mdash;<em>ta&rsquo;maral&rsquo;ailen</em>, it&rsquo;s called&mdash;can last for weeks, or for years. It can take in a town, or even
the whole Pattern. Artur Hawkwing was <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>. So was
Lews Therin Kinslayer, for that matter, I suppose.&rdquo; He let out a
booming chuckle. &ldquo;Elder Haman would be proud of me. He always
droned on, and the books about traveling were much more
interesting, but I did listen sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very well,&rdquo; Rand said, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t see
what it has to do with me. I&rsquo;m a shepherd, not another Artur
Hawkwing. And neither is Mat, or Perrin. It&rsquo;s just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say you were, but I could almost feel the
Pattern swirl just listening to you tell your tale, and I have no
Talent there. You are <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, all right. You, and maybe
your friends, too.&rdquo; The Ogier paused, rubbing the bridge of his
broad nose thoughtfully. Finally he nodded to himself as if he had
reached a decision. &ldquo;I wish to travel with you, Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a minute Rand stared, wondering if he had heard
correctly. &ldquo;With me?&rdquo; he exclaimed when he could speak. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you
hear what I said about&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; He eyed the door suddenly. It was
shut tight, and thick enough that anyone trying to listen on the
other side would hear only a murmur, even with his ear pressed
against the wooden panels. Just the same he went on in a lower
voice. &ldquo;About who&rsquo;s chasing me? Anyway, I thought you wanted to go
see your trees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a very fine grove at Tar Valon, and I have
been told the Aes Sedai keep it well tended. Besides, it is not
just the groves I want to see. Perhaps you are not another Artur
Hawkwing, but for a time, at least, part of the world will shape
itself around you, perhaps is even now shaping itself around you.
Even Elder Haman would want to see that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand hesitated. It would be good to have someone else
along. The way Mat was behaving, being with him was almost like
being alone. The Ogier was a comforting presence. Maybe he was
young as Ogier reckoned age, but he seemed as unflappable as a
rock, just like Tam. And Loial had been all of those places, and
knew about others. He looked at the Ogier, sitting there with his
broad face a picture of patience. Sitting there, and taller sitting
than most men standing. <em>How do you hide somebody almost ten
feet tall?</em> He sighed and shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that is a good idea, Loial. Even if
Moiraine finds us here, we&rsquo;ll be in danger all the way to Tar
Valon. If she does not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; <em>If she doesn&rsquo;t, then she&rsquo;s dead
and so is everyone else. Oh, Egwene</em>. He gave himself a shake.
Egwene was not dead, and Moiraine would find them.</p>

<p>Loial looked at him sympathetically and touched his
shoulder. &ldquo;I am sure your friends are well, Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand nodded his thanks. His throat was too tight to
speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you at least talk with me sometimes?&rdquo; Loial
sighed, a bass rumble. &ldquo;And perhaps play a game of stones? I have
not had anyone to talk to in days, except good Master Gill, and he
is busy most of the time. The cook seems to run him unmercifully.
Perhaps she really owns the inn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, I will.&rdquo; His voice was hoarse. He cleared
his throat and tried to grin. &ldquo;And if we meet in Tar Valon, you can
show me the grove there.&rdquo; <em>They have to be all right. Light send
they&rsquo;re all right</em>.</p>
