<h4><em>The Dark One Stirs</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">D</span>awn woke Rand with a start, the sullen sun pricking
his eyelids as it peeked reluctantly over the treetops of the
Blight. Even so early, heat covered the spoiled lands in a heavy
blanket. He lay on his back with his head pillowed on his
blanketroll, staring at the sky. It was still blue, the sky. Even
here, that, at least, was untouched.</p>

<p>He was surprised to realize that he had slept. For a
minute the dim memory of a conversation overheard seemed like part
of some dream. Then he saw Nynaeve&rsquo;s red-rimmed eyes; she had not
slept, obviously. Lan&rsquo;s face was harder than ever, as if he had
resumed a mask and did not intend to let it slip again.</p>

<p>Egwene went over and crouched beside the Wisdom, her
face concerned. He could not make out what they said. Egwene spoke,
and Nynaeve shook her head. Egwene said something else, and the
Wisdom waved her away dismissively. Instead of going, Egwene bent
her head closer, and for a few minutes the two women talked even
more softly, with Nynaeve still shaking her head. The Wisdom ended
it with a laugh, hugging Egwene and, by her expression, making
soothing talk. When Egwene stood, though, she glared at the Warder.
Lan did not seem to notice; he did not look in Nynaeve&rsquo;s direction
at all.</p>

<p>Shaking his head, Rand gathered his things, and gave
his hands and face and teeth a hasty wash with the little water Lan
allowed for such things. He wondered if women had a way of reading
men&rsquo;s minds. It was an unsettling thought. <em>All women are Aes
Sedai</em>. Telling himself he was letting the Blight get to him,
he rinsed out his mouth and hurried to get the bay saddled.</p>

<p>It was more than a little disconcerting, having the
campsite disappear before he reached the horses, but by the time
his saddle girth was tight everything on the hill winked back into
view. Everyone was hurrying.</p>

<p>The seven towers stood plain in the morning light,
distant broken stumps, like huge, rough hills that merely hinted at
grandeur gone. The hundred lakes were a smooth, unruffled blue.
Nothing broke the surface this morning. When he looked at the lakes
and the ruined towers, he could almost ignore the sickly things
growing around the hill. Lan did not seem to be avoiding looking at
the towers, any more than he seemed to be avoiding Nynaeve, but
somehow he never did as he concentrated on getting them ready to
go.</p>

<p>After the wicker panniers were fastened on the
packhorse, after every scrap and smudge and track were gone and
everyone else was mounted, the Aes Sedai stood in the middle of the
hilltop with her eyes closed, not even seeming to breathe. Nothing
happened that Rand could see, except that Nynaeve and Egwene
shivered despite the heat and rubbed their arms briskly. Egwene&rsquo;s
hands suddenly froze on her arms, and she opened her mouth, staring
at the Wisdom. Before she could speak, Nynaeve also ceased her
rubbing and gave her a sharp look. The two women looked at one
another, then Egwene nodded and grinned, and after a moment Nynaeve
did, too, though her smile was only halfhearted.</p>

<p>Rand scrubbed his fingers through his hair, already
more damp with sweat than with the water he had splashed in his
face. He was sure there was something in the silent exchange that
he should understand, but that feather-light brush across his mind
vanished before he could grasp it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are we waiting for?&rdquo; Mat demanded, the low band
of his scarf across his forehead. He had his bow across the pommel
of his saddle with an arrow nocked, and his quiver pulled around on
his belt for an easy reach.</p>

<p>Moiraine opened her eyes and started down the hill.
&ldquo;For me to remove the last vestige of what I did here last night.
The residues would have dissipated on their own in a day, but I
will not take any risk I can avoid now. We are too close, and the
Shadow is too strong here. Lan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Warder only waited for her to settle in Aldieb&rsquo;s
saddle before he led them north, toward the Mountains of Dhoom,
looming in the near distance. Even under the sunrise the peaks rose
black and lifeless, like jagged teeth. In a wall they stretched,
east and west as far as the eye could see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will we reach the Eye today, Moiraine Sedai?&rdquo; Egwene
asked.</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai gave Loial a sidelong look. &ldquo;I hope
that we will. When I found it before, it was just the other side of
the mountains, at the foot of the high passes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He says it moves,&rdquo; Mat said, nodding at Loial. &ldquo;What
if it isn&rsquo;t where you expect?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we will continue to hunt until we do find it.
The Green Man senses need, and there can be no need greater than
ours. Our need is the hope of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the mountains drew closer, so did the true Blight.
Where a leaf had been spotted black and mottled yellow before, now
foliage fell wetly while he watched, breaking apart from the weight
of its own corruption. The trees themselves were tortured, crippled
things, twisted branches clawing at the sky as if begging mercy
from some power that refused to hear. Ooze slid like pus from bark
cracked and split. As if nothing truly solid was left to them, the
trees seemed to tremble from the passage of the horses over the
ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look as if they want to grab us,&rdquo; Mat said
nervously. Nynaeve gave him an exasperated, scornful look, and he
added fiercely, &ldquo;Well, they do look it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And some of them do want it,&rdquo; the Aes Sedai said.
Her eyes over her shoulder were harder than Lan&rsquo;s for an instant.
&ldquo;But they want no part of what I am, and my presence protects
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat laughed uneasily, as if he thought it a joke on
her part.</p>

<p>Rand was not so sure. This <em>was</em> the Blight,
after all. <em>But trees don&rsquo;t move. Why would a tree grab a man,
even if it could? We&rsquo;re imagining things, and she&rsquo;s just trying to
keep us alert</em>.</p>

<p>Abruptly he stared off to his left, into the forest.
That tree, not twenty paces away, <em>had</em> trembled, and it was
none of his imagination. He could not say what kind it was, or had
been, so gnarled and tormented was its shape. As he watched, the
tree suddenly whipped back and forth again, then bent down,
flailing at the ground. Something screamed, shrill and piercing.
The tree sprang back straight; its limbs entwined around a dark
mass that writhed and spat and screamed.</p>

<p>He swallowed hard and tried to edge Red away, but
trees stood on every side, and trembled. The bay rolled his eyes,
whites showing all the way around. Rand found himself in a solid
knot of horseflesh as everyone else tried to do the same as he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep moving,&rdquo; Lan commanded, drawing his sword. The
Warder wore steel-backed gauntlets now, and his gray-green scale
tunic. &ldquo;Stay with Moiraine Sedai.&rdquo; He pulled Mandarb around, not
toward the tree and its prey, but in the other direction. With his
color-shifting cloak, he was swallowed by the Blight before the
black stallion was out of sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Close,&rdquo; Moiraine urged. She did not slow her white
mare, but she motioned the others to huddle nearer to her. &ldquo;Stay as
close as you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A roar sprang up from the direction the Warder had
gone. It beat at the air, and the trees quivered from it, and when
it faded away, it seemed to echo still. Again the roar came, filled
with rage and death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lan,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. &ldquo;He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The awful sound cut her off, but there was a new note
in it. Fear. Abruptly it was gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lan can look after himself,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;Ride,
Wisdom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From out of the trees the Warder appeared, holding
his sword well clear of himself and his mount. Black blood stained
the blade, and steam rose from it. Carefully, Lan wiped the blade
clean with a cloth he took from his saddlebags, examining the steel
to make sure he had gotten every spot. When he dropped the cloth,
it fell apart before it reached the ground, even the fragments
dissolving.</p>

<p>Silently a massive body leaped out of the trees at
them. The Warder spun Mandarb, but even as the warhorse reared,
ready to strike with steelshod hooves, Mat&rsquo;s arrow flashed,
piercing the one eye in a head that seemed mostly mouth and teeth.
Kicking and screaming, the thing fell, one bound short of them.
Rand stared as they hurried past. Stiff hair like long bristles
covered it, and it had too many legs, joining a body as big as a
bear at odd angles. Some of them at least, those coming out of its
back, had to be useless for walking, but the finger-long claws at
their ends tore the earth in its death agony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good shooting, sheepherder.&rdquo; Lan&rsquo;s eyes had already
forgotten what was dying behind them, and were searching the
forest.</p>

<p>Moiraine shook her head. &ldquo;It should not have been
willing to come so close to one who touches the True Source.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Agelmar said the Blight stirs,&rdquo; Lan said. &ldquo;Perhaps
the Blight also knows a Web is forming in the Pattern.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry.&rdquo; Moiraine dug her heels into Aldieb&rsquo;s flanks.
&ldquo;We must get over the high passes quickly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But even as she spoke the Blight rose against them.
Trees whipped in, reaching for them, not caring if Moiraine touched
the True Source or not.</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s sword was in his hand; he did not remember
unsheathing it. He struck out again and again, the heron-mark blade
slicing through corrupted limbs. Hungry branches jerked back
severed, writhing stumps&mdash;he almost thought he heard them
scream&mdash;but always more came, wriggling like snakes,
attempting to snare his arms, his waist, his neck. Teeth bared in a
rictus snarl, he sought the void, and found it in the stony,
stubborn soil of the Two Rivers. &ldquo;Manetheren!&rdquo; He screamed back at
the trees till his throat ached. The heron-mark steel flashed in
the strengthless sunlight. &ldquo;Manetheren! Manetheren!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Standing in his stirrups, Mat sent arrow after arrow
flashing into the forest, striking at deformed shapes that snarled
and gnashed uncounted teeth on the shafts that killed them, bit at
the clawed forms fighting to get over them, to reach the mounted
figures. Mat, too, was lost to the present. &ldquo;<em>Carai an
Caldazar!</em>&rdquo; he shouted as he drew fletchings to cheek and
loosed. &ldquo;<em>Carai an Ellisande! Al Ellisande! Mordero daghain pas
duente cuebiyar! Al Ellisande!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin also stood in his stirrups, silent and grim.
He had taken the lead, and his axe hewed a path through forest and
foul flesh alike, whichever came before him. Flailing trees and
howling things shied from the stocky axeman, shying as much from
the fierce golden eyes as from the whistling axe. He forced his
horse forward, step by determined step.</p>

<p>Fireballs streaked from Moiraine&rsquo;s hands, and where
they struck, a writhing tree became a torch, a toothed shape
shrieked and beat with human hands, rent its own flaming flesh with
fierce claws until it died.</p>

<p>Again and again the Warder took Mandarb into the
trees, his blade and gauntlets dripping with blood that bubbled and
steamed. When he came back now, more often than not there were
gashes in his armor, bleeding gashes in his flesh, and his warhorse
stumbled and bled, too. Each time the Aes Sedai paused to lay her
hands on the wounds, and when she took them away, only the blood
was left on unmarked flesh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I light signal fires for the Halfmen,&rdquo; she said
bitterly. &ldquo;Press on. Press on!&rdquo; They made their way one slow pace
at a time.</p>

<p>If the trees had not struck into the mass of
attacking flesh as much as at the humans, if the creatures, no two
alike, had not fought the trees and one another as much as to reach
them, Rand was sure they would have been overwhelmed. He was not
certain it would not happen still. Then a fluting cry arose behind
them. Distant and thin, it cut through the snarling from the
denizens of the Blight around them.</p>

<p>In an instant the snarling ceased, as if it had been
sliced off with a knife. The attacking shapes froze; the trees went
still. As suddenly as the things with legs had appeared, they
melted away, vanishing into the twisted forest.</p>

<p>The reedy shrill came again, like a cracked
shepherd&rsquo;s pipes, and was answered in kind by a chorus. Half a
dozen, singing among themselves, far behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Worms,&rdquo; Lan said grimly, bringing a moan from Loial.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve given us a respite, if we have time to use it.&rdquo; His eyes
were measuring the distance yet to the mountains. &ldquo;Few things in
the Blight will face a Worm, can it be avoided.&rdquo; He dug his heels
into Mandarb&rsquo;s flanks. &ldquo;Ride!&rdquo; The whole party plunged after him,
through a Blight that suddenly seemed truly dead, except for the
piping behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were scared off by worms?&rdquo; Mat said
incredulously. He was bouncing in his saddle, trying to sling his
bow across his back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Worm&rdquo;&mdash;there was a sharp difference in the
way the Warder said it from the way Mat had&mdash;&ldquo;can kill a
Fade, if the Fade hasn&rsquo;t the Dark One&rsquo;s own luck with it. We have
an entire pack on our trail. Ride! Ride!&rdquo; The dark peaks were
closer now. An hour, Rand estimated, at the pace the Warder was
setting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t the Worms follow us into the mountains?&rdquo;
Egwene asked breathlessly, and Lan gave a sharp laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t. Worms are afraid of what lives in the
high passes.&rdquo; Loial moaned again.</p>

<p>Rand wished the Ogier would stop doing that. He was
well aware that Loial knew more about the Blight than any of them
except Lan, even if it was from reading books in the safety of a
<em>stedding</em>. <em>But why does he have to keep reminding me
that there&rsquo;s worse yet than we&rsquo;ve seen?</em></p>

<p>The Blight flowed past, weeds and grasses splashing
rotten under galloping hooves. Trees of the kinds that had earlier
attacked did not so much as twitch even when they rode directly
under the twisted branches. The Mountains of Dhoom filled the sky
ahead, black and bleak, and almost near enough to touch, it seemed.
The piping came both sharp and clear, and there were squishing
sounds behind them, louder than the things crushed under hooves.
Too loud, as if half-decayed trees were being crushed by huge
bodies slithering over them. Too near. Rand looked over his
shoulder. Back there treetops whipped and went down like grass. The
land began sloping upward, toward the mountains, tilting enough so
that he knew they were climbing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are not going to make it,&rdquo; Lan announced. He did
not slow Mandarb&rsquo;s gallop, but his sword was suddenly in his hand
again. &ldquo;Watch yourself in the high passes, Moiraine, and you&rsquo;ll get
through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Lan!&rdquo; Nynaeve called.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, girl! Lan, even you cannot stop a
Wormpack. I will not have it. I will need you for the Eye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arrows,&rdquo; Mat called breathlessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Worms wouldn&rsquo;t even feel them,&rdquo; the Warder
shouted. &ldquo;They must be cut to pieces. Don&rsquo;t feel much but hunger.
Sometimes fear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clinging to his saddle with a deathgrip, Rand
shrugged, trying to loosen the tightness in his shoulders. His
whole chest felt tight, until he could hardly breathe, and his skin
stung in hot pinpricks. The Blight had turned to foothills. He
could see the route they must climb once they reached the
mountains, the twisting path and the high pass beyond, like an axe
blow cleaving into the black stone. <em>Light, what&rsquo;s up ahead that
can scare what&rsquo;s behind? Light help me, I&rsquo;ve never been so afraid.
I don&rsquo;t want to go any further. No further!</em> Seeking the flame
and the void, he railed at himself. <em>Fool! You frightened,
cowardly fool! You can&rsquo;t stay here, and you can&rsquo;t go back. Are you
going to leave Egwene to face it alone?</em> The void eluded him,
forming, then shivering into a thousand points of light, re-forming
and shattering again, each point burning into his bones until he
quivered with the pain and thought he must burst open. <em>Light
help me, I can&rsquo;t go on. Light help me!</em></p>

<p>He was gathering the bay&rsquo;s reins to turn back, to
face the Worms or anything rather than what lay ahead, when the
nature of the land changed. Between one slope of a hill and the
next, between crest and peak, the Blight was gone.</p>

<p>Green leaves covered peacefully spreading branches.
Wildflowers made a carpet of bright patches in grasses stirred by a
sweet spring breeze. Butterflies fluttered from blossom to blossom,
with buzzing bees, and birds trilled their songs.</p>

<p>Gaping, he galloped on, until he suddenly realized
that Moiraine and Lan and Loial had stopped, the others, too.
Slowly he drew rein, his face frozen in astonishment. Egwene&rsquo;s eyes
were about to come out of her head, and Nynaeve&rsquo;s jaw had
dropped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have reached safety,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;This is the
Green Man&rsquo;s place, and the Eye of the World is here. Nothing of the
Blight can enter here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought it was on the other side of the
mountains,&rdquo; Rand mumbled. He could still see the peaks filling the
northern horizon, and the high passes. &ldquo;You said it was always
beyond the passes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This place,&rdquo; said a deep voice from the trees, &ldquo;is
always where it is. All that changes is where those who need it
are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A figure stepped out of the foliage, a man-shape as
much bigger than Loial as the Ogier was bigger than Rand. A
man-shape of woven vines and leaves, green and growing. His hair
was grass, flowing to his shoulders; his eyes, huge hazelnuts; his
fingernails, acorns. Green leaves made his tunic and trousers;
seamless bark, his boots. Butterflies swirled around him, lighting
on his fingers, his shoulders, his face. Only one thing spoiled the
verdant perfection. A deep fissure ran up his cheek and temple
across the top of his head, and in that the vines were brown and
withered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Green Man,&rdquo; Egwene whispered, and the scarred
face smiled. For a moment it seemed as if the birds sang
louder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I am. Who else would be here?&rdquo; The
hazelnut eyes regarded Loial. &ldquo;It is good to see you, little
brother. In the past, many of you came to visit me, but few of
recent days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial scrambled down from his big horse and bowed
formally. &ldquo;You honor me, Treebrother. <em>Tsingu ma choshih,
T&rsquo;ingshen</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Smiling, the Green Man put an arm around the Ogier&rsquo;s
shoulders. Alongside Loial, he looked like a man beside a boy.
&ldquo;There is no honoring, little brother. We will sing Treesongs
together, and remember the Great Trees, and the <em>stedding</em>,
and hold the Longing at bay.&rdquo; He studied the others, just now
getting down from their horses, and his eyes lit on Perrin. &ldquo;A
Wolfbrother! Do the old times truly walk again then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stared at Perrin. For his part, Perrin turned
his horse so it was between him and the Green Man, and bent to
check the girth. Rand was sure he just wanted to avoid the Green
Man&rsquo;s searching gaze. Suddenly the Green Man spoke to Rand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strange clothes you wear, Child of the Dragon. Has
the Wheel turned so far? Do the People of the Dragon return to the
First Covenant? But you wear a sword. That is neither now nor
then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand had to work moisture in his mouth before he
could speak. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about. What do you
mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Green Man touched the brown scar across his head.
For a moment he seemed confused. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;cannot say. My memories
are torn and often fleeting, and much of what remains is like
leaves visited by caterpillars. Yet, I am sure&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;No, it is
gone. But you are welcome here. You, Moiraine Sedai, are more than
a surprise. When this place was made, it was made so that none
could find it twice. How have you come here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Need,&rdquo; Moiraine replied. &ldquo;My need, the world&rsquo;s need.
Most of all is the world&rsquo;s need. We have come to see the Eye of the
World.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Green Man sighed, the wind sighing through
thick-leafed branches. &ldquo;Then it has come again. That memory remains
whole. The Dark One stirs. I have feared it. Every turning of
years, the Blight strives harder to come inside, and this turn the
struggle to keep it out has been greater than ever since the
beginning. Come, I will take you.&rdquo;</p>
