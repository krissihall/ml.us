<h4><em>Remembrance of Dreams</em></h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t
was a subdued group that Rand led back down the
stairs. None of them wanted to talk to him now, or to one another.
He did not feel much like talking, either.</p>

<p>The sun was far enough across the sky to dim the back
stairwell, but the lamps had not yet been lit. Sunlight and shadow
striped the stairs. Perrin&rsquo;s face was as closed as the others, but
where worry creased everyone else&rsquo;s brow, his was smooth. Rand
thought the look Perrin wore was resignation. He wondered why, and
wanted to ask, but whenever Perrin walked through a deeper patch of
shadow, his eyes seemed to gather in what little light there was,
glowing softly like polished amber.</p>

<p>Rand shivered and tried to concentrate on his
surroundings, on the walnut paneled walls and the oak stair
railing, on sturdy, everyday things He wiped his hands on his coat
several times, but each time sweat sprang out on his palms anew.
<em>It&rsquo;ll all be all right, now. We&rsquo;re together again, and</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Light, Mat</em>.</p>

<p>He took them to the library by the back way that went
by the kitchens, avoiding the common room. Not many travelers used
the library; most of those who could read stayed at more elegant
inns in the Inner City. Master Gill kept it more for his own
enjoyment than for the handful of patrons who wanted a book now and
then. Rand did not want to think why Moiraine wanted them to keep
out of sight, but he kept remembering the Whitecloak under-officer
saying he would be back, and Elaida&rsquo;s eyes when she asked where he
was staying. Those were reasons enough, whatever Moiraine
wanted.</p>

<p>He took five steps into the library before he
realized that everyone else had stopped, crowded together in the
doorway, openmouthed and goggling. A brisk blaze crackled in the
fireplace, and Loial was sprawled on the long couch, reading, a
small black cat with white feet curled and half asleep on his
stomach. When they entered he closed the book with a huge finger
marking his place and gently set the cat on the floor, then stood
to bow formally.</p>

<p>Rand was so used to the Ogier that it took him a
minute to realize that Loial was the object of the others&rsquo; stares.
&ldquo;These are the friends I was waiting for, Loial,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is
Nynaeve, the Wisdom of my village. And Perrin. And this is
Egwene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; Loial boomed, &ldquo;Egwene. Rand has spoken of
you a great deal. Yes. I am Loial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an Ogier,&rdquo; Rand explained, and watched their
amazement change in kind. Even after Trollocs and Fades in the
flesh, it was still astonishing to meet a legend walking and
breathing. Remembering his own first reaction to Loial, he grinned
ruefully. They were doing better than he had.</p>

<p>Loial took their gaping in his stride. Rand supposed
he hardly noticed it compared with a mob shouting &ldquo;Trolloc.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the Aes Sedai, Rand?&rdquo; Loial asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upstairs with Mat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Ogier raised one bushy eyebrow thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Then he <em>is</em> ill. I suggest we all be seated. She will be
joining us? Yes. Then there&rsquo;s nothing to do but wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The act of sitting seemed to loosen some catch inside
the Emond&rsquo;s Field folk, as if being in a well-stuffed chair with a
fire in the fireplace and a cat now curled up on the hearth made
them feel at home. As soon as they were settled they excitedly
began asking the Ogier questions. To Rand&rsquo;s surprise, Perrin was
the first to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <em>stedding</em>, Loial. Are they really
havens, the way the stories say?&rdquo; His voice was intent, as if he
had a particular reason for asking.</p>

<p>Loial was glad to tell about the <em>stedding</em>,
and how he came to be at The Queen&rsquo;s Blessing, and what he had seen
in his travels. Rand soon leaned back, only partly listening. He
had heard it all before, in detail. Loial liked to talk, and talk
at length when he had the slightest chance, though he usually
seemed to think a story needed two or three hundred years of
background to make it understood. His sense of time was very
strange; to him three hundred years seemed a reasonable length of
time for a story or explanation to cover. He always talked about
leaving the <em>stedding</em> as if it were just a few months
before, but it had finally come out that he had been gone more than
three years.</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s thoughts drifted to Mat. <em>A dagger. A
bloody knife, and it might kill him just from carrying it. Light, I
don&rsquo;t want any more adventure. If she can heal him, we should all
go</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>not home. Can&rsquo;t go home. Somewhere. We&rsquo;ll all go
somewhere they&rsquo;ve never heard of Aes Sedai or the Dark One.
Somewhere</em>.</p>

<p>The door opened, and for a moment Rand thought he was
still imagining. Mat stood there, blinking, with his coat buttoned
up and the dark scarf wrapped low around his forehead. Then Rand
saw Moiraine, with her hand on Mat&rsquo;s shoulder, and Lan behind them.
The Aes Sedai was watching Mat carefully, as one watches someone
only lately out of a sickbed. As always, Lan was watching
everything while appearing to watch nothing.</p>

<p>Mat looked as if he had never been sick a day. His
first, hesitant smile included everyone, though it slipped into an
openmouthed stare at the sight of Loial, as if he were seeing the
Ogier for the first time. With a shrug and a shake, he turned his
attention back to his friends. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He
took a deep breath. &ldquo;It&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;it seems I&rsquo;ve been acting&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;sort of oddly. I don&rsquo;t remember much of it, really.&rdquo;
He gave Moiraine an uneasy look. She smiled back confidently, and
he went on. &ldquo;Everything is hazy after Whitebridge. Thom, and the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He shivered and hurried on. &ldquo;The further from Whitebridge, the
hazier it gets. I don&rsquo;t really remember arriving in Caemlyn at
all.&rdquo; He eyed Loial askance. &ldquo;Not really. Moiraine Sedai says I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;upstairs, I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He grinned, and suddenly he truly was
the old Mat. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t hold a man to blame for what he does when
he&rsquo;s crazy, can you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You always were crazy,&rdquo; Perrin said, and for a
moment he, too, sounded as of old.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. Tears made her eyes bright, but
she was smiling. &ldquo;None of us blames you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand and Egwene began talking at once then, telling
Mat how happy they were to see him well and how well he looked,
with a few laughing comments thrown in about hoping that he was
done with tricks now that one so ugly had been played on him. Mat
met banter with banter as he found a chair with all of his old
swagger. As he sat down, still grinning, he absentmindedly touched
his coat as if to make sure that something tucked behind his belt
was still there, and Rand&rsquo;s breath caught.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Moiraine said quietly, &ldquo;he still has the
dagger.&rdquo; The laughter and talk was still going on among the rest of
the Emond&rsquo;s Field folk, but she had noticed his sudden intake of
breath and had seen what had caused it. She moved closer to his
chair, where she did not have to raise her voice for him to hear
clearly. &ldquo;I cannot take it away from him without killing him. The
binding has lasted too long, and grown too strong. That must be
unknotted in Tar Valon; it is beyond me, or any lone Aes Sedai,
even with an <em>angreal</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he doesn&rsquo;t look sick anymore.&rdquo; He had a thought
and looked up at her. &ldquo;As long as he has the dagger, the Fades will
know where we are. Darkfriends, too, some of them. You said
so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have contained that, after a fashion. If they come
close enough to sense it now, they will be on top of us anyway. I
cleansed the taint from him, Rand, and did what I could to slow its
return, but return it will, in time, unless he receives help in Tar
Valon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good thing that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re going, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; He
thought maybe it was the resignation in his voice, and the hope for
something else, that made her give him a sharp look before turning
away.</p>

<p>Loial was on his feet, bowing to her. &ldquo;I am Loial,
son of Arent son of Halan, Aes Sedai. The <em>stedding</em> offers
sanctuary to the Servants of the Light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Loial, son of Arent,&rdquo; Moiraine answered
dryly, &ldquo;but I would not be too free with that greeting if I were
you. There are perhaps twenty Aes Sedai in Caemlyn at this moment,
and every one but I of the Red Ajah.&rdquo; Loial nodded sagely, as if he
understood. Rand could only shake his head in confusion; he would
be Lightblinded if <em>he</em> knew what she meant. &ldquo;It is strange
to find you here,&rdquo; the Aes Sedai went on. &ldquo;Few Ogier leave the
<em>stedding</em> in recent years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old stories caught me, Aes Sedai. The old books
filled my unworthy head with pictures. I want to see the groves.
And the cities we built, too. There do not seem to be many of
either still standing, but if buildings are a poor substitute for
trees, they are still worth seeing. The Elders think I&rsquo;m odd,
wanting to travel. I always have, and they always have. None of
them believe there is anything worth seeing outside the
<em>stedding</em>. Perhaps when I return and tell them what I&rsquo;ve
seen, they will change their minds. I hope so. In time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they will,&rdquo; Moiraine said smoothly. &ldquo;Now,
Loial, you must forgive me for being abrupt. It is a failing of
humankind, I know. My companions and I have urgent need to plan our
journey. If you could excuse us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Loial&rsquo;s turn to look confused. Rand came to
his rescue. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming with us. I promised him he could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine stood looking at the Ogier as if she had not
heard, but finally she nodded. &ldquo;The Wheel weaves as the Wheel
wills,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Lan, see that we are not taken unaware.&rdquo; The
Warder vanished from the room, silently but for the click of the
door shutting behind him.</p>

<p>Lan&rsquo;s disappearance acted like a signal; all talk was
cut off. Moiraine moved to the fireplace, and when she turned back
to the room every eye was on her. Slight of build as she was, her
presence dominated. &ldquo;We cannot remain long in Caemlyn, nor are we
safe here in The Queen&rsquo;s Blessing. The Dark One&rsquo;s eyes are already
in the city. They have not found what they are searching for, or
they would not still be looking. That we have to our advantage. I
have set wards to keep them away, and by the time the Dark One
realizes that there is a part of the city the rats no longer enter,
we will be gone. Any ward that will turn a man aside, though, would
be as good as a beacon fire for the Myrddraal, and there are
Children of the Light in Caemlyn, also, looking for Perrin and
Egwene.&rdquo; Rand made a sound, and Moiraine raised an eyebrow at
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought they were looking for Mat and me,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>The explanation made both the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s eyebrows
lift. &ldquo;Why would you think the Whitecloaks were looking for
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard one say they were looking for someone from
the Two Rivers. Darkfriends, he said. What else was I supposed to
think? With everything that&rsquo;s been happening, I&rsquo;m lucky I can think
at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has been confusing, I know, Rand,&rdquo; Loial put in,
&ldquo;but you can think more clearly than that. The Children hate Aes
Sedai. Elaida would not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elaida?&rdquo; Moiraine cut in sharply. &ldquo;What has Elaida
Sedai to do with this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was looking at Rand so hard that he wanted to
lean back. &ldquo;She wanted to throw me in prison,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;All
I wanted was a look at Logain, but she wouldn&rsquo;t believe I was in
the Palace gardens with Elayne and Gawyn just by chance.&rdquo; They were
all staring at him as if he had suddenly sprouted a third eye, all
except Loial. &ldquo;Queen Morgase let me go. She said there was no proof
I meant any harm and she was going to uphold the law no matter what
Elaida suspected.&rdquo; He shook his head, the memory of Morgase in all
her radiance making him forget for a minute that anyone was looking
at him. &ldquo;Can you imagine me meeting a Queen? She&rsquo;s beautiful, like
the queens in stories. So is Elayne. And Gawyn&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;you&rsquo;d like
Gawyn, Perrin. Perrin? Mat?&rdquo; They were still staring. &ldquo;Blood and
ashes, I just climbed up on the wall for a look at the false
Dragon. I didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I always say,&rdquo; Mat said blandly, though
he was suddenly grinning hard, and Egwene asked in a decidedly
neutral voice, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Elayne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine muttered something crossly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Queen,&rdquo; Perrin said, shaking his head. &ldquo;You really
have had adventures. All we met were Tinkers and some Whitecloaks.&rdquo;
He avoided looking at Moiraine so obviously that Rand saw the
avoidance plain. Perrin touched the bruises on his face. &ldquo;On the
whole, singing with the Tinkers was more fun than the
Whitecloaks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Traveling People live for their songs,&rdquo; Loial
said. &ldquo;For all songs, for that matter. For the search for them, at
least. I met some Tuatha&rsquo;an a few years back, and they wanted to
learn the songs we sing to trees. Actually, the trees won&rsquo;t listen
to very many anymore, and so not many Ogier learn the songs. I have
a scrap of that Talent, so Elder Arent insisted I learn. I taught
the Tuatha&rsquo;an what they could learn, but the trees never listen to
humans. For the Traveling People they were only songs, and just as
well received for that, since none was the song they seek. That&rsquo;s
what they call the leader of each band, the Seeker. They come to
Stedding Shangtai, sometimes. Few humans do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please, Loial,&rdquo; Moiraine said, but he cleared
his throat suddenly and went on in a quick rumble as if afraid she
might stop him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just remembered something, Aes Sedai, something
I have always wanted to ask an Aes Sedai if ever I met one, since
you know many things and have great libraries in Tar Valon, and now
I have, of course, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;may I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you make it brief,&rdquo; she said curtly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brief,&rdquo; he said as though wondering what it meant.
&ldquo;Yes. Well. Brief. There was a man came to Stedding
Shangtai a little time back. This was not unusual in itself, at the
time, since a great many refugees had come to the Spine of the
World fleeing what you humans call the Aiel War.&rdquo; Rand grinned. A
little time back; twenty years, near enough. &ldquo;He was at the point
of death, though there was no wound or mark on him. The Elders
thought it might be something Aes Sedai had done&rdquo;&mdash;Loial gave
Moiraine an apologetic look&mdash;&ldquo;since as soon as he was within
the <em>stedding</em> he quickly got well. A few months. One night
he left without a word to anyone, simply sneaked away when the moon
was down.&rdquo; He looked at Moiraine&rsquo;s face and cleared his throat
again. &ldquo;Yes. Brief. Before he left, he told a curious tale which he
said he meant to carry to Tar Valon. He said the Dark One intended
to blind the Eye of the World, and slay the Great Serpent, kill
time itself. The Elders said he was as sound in his mind as in his
body, but that was what he said. What I have wanted to ask is, can
the Dark One do such a thing? Kill time itself? And the Eye of the
World? Can he blind the eye of the Great Serpent? What does it
mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand expected almost anything from Moiraine except
what he saw. Instead of giving Loial an answer, or telling him she
had no time for it now, she stood there staring right through the
Ogier, frowning in thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the Tinkers told us,&rdquo; Perrin said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Egwene said, &ldquo;the Aiel story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine turned her head slowly. No other part of her
moved. &ldquo;What story?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was an expressionless look she gave them, but it
made Perrin take a deep breath, though when he spoke he was as
deliberate as ever. &ldquo;Some Tinkers crossing the Waste&mdash;they
said they could do that unharmed&mdash;found Aiel dying after a
battle with Trollocs. Before the last Aiel died, she&mdash;they
were all women, apparently&mdash;told the Tinkers what Loial just
said. The Dark One&mdash;they called him Sightblinder&mdash;intends to blind the Eye of the World. This was only three years
ago, not twenty. Does it mean something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps everything,&rdquo; Moiraine said. Her face was
still, but Rand had the feeling her mind raced behind those dark
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ba&rsquo;alzamon,&rdquo; Perrin said suddenly. The name cut off
all sound in the room. No one appeared to breathe. Perrin looked at
Rand, then at Mat, his eyes strangely calm and more yellow than
ever. &ldquo;At the time I wondered where I&rsquo;d heard that name before&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the Eye of the World. Now I remember. Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to remember anything,&rdquo; Mat said
stiffly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have to tell her,&rdquo; Perrin continued. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
important now. We can&rsquo;t keep it secret any longer. You see it,
don&rsquo;t you, Rand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me what?&rdquo; Moiraine&rsquo;s voice was harsh, and she
seemed to be bracing for a blow. Her gaze had settled on Rand.</p>

<p>He did not want to answer. He did not want to
remember any more than Mat, but he did remember&mdash;and he knew
Perrin was right. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He looked at his friends. Mat nodded
reluctantly, Perrin decisively, but at least they had done it. He
did not have to face her alone. &ldquo;We have had&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;dreams.&rdquo; He
rubbed the spot on his finger where the thorn had stuck him once,
remembering the blood when he woke. Queasily remembering the
sunburned feel of his face another time. &ldquo;Except maybe they weren&rsquo;t
dreams, exactly. Ba&rsquo;alzamon was in them.&rdquo; He knew why Perrin had
used that name; it was easier than saying the Dark One had been in
your dreams, inside your head. &ldquo;He said&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;he said all sorts of
things, but once he said the Eye of the World would never serve
me.&rdquo; For a minute his mouth was as dry as dust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He told me the same thing,&rdquo; Perrin said, and Mat
sighed heavily, then nodded. Rand found he had spit in his mouth
again. &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t angry with us?&rdquo; Perrin asked, sounding
surprised, and Rand realized that Moiraine did not seem angry. She
was studying them, but her eyes were clear and calm, if intent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More with myself than you. But I did ask you to tell
me if you had strange dreams. In the beginning, I asked.&rdquo; Though
her voice remained level, a flash of anger crossed her eyes, and
was gone in an instant. &ldquo;Had I known after the first such, I might
have been able to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;There has not been a Dreamwalker in Tar
Valon for nearly a thousand years, but I could have tried. Now it
is too late. Each time the Dark One touches you, he makes the next
touching easier for him. Perhaps my presence can still shield you
somewhat, but even then&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Remember the stories of the Forsaken
binding men to them? Strong men, men who had fought the Dark One
from the start. Those stories are true, and none of the Forsaken
had a tenth of the strength of their master, not Aginor or Lanfear,
not Balthamel or Demandred, not even Ishamael, the Betrayer of Hope
himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve and Egwene were looking at him, Rand saw, him
and Mat and Perrin all three. The women&rsquo;s faces were a
blood-drained blend of fear and horror. <em>Are they afraid for us,
or afraid of us?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;What can we do?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;There has to be
something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Staying close by me,&rdquo; Moiraine replied, &ldquo;will help.
Some. The protection from touching the True Source extends around
me a little, remember. But you cannot always remain close to me.
You can defend yourself, if you have the strength for it, but you
must find the strength and will within yourself. I cannot give it
to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve already found my protection,&rdquo; Perrin
said, sounding resigned rather than happy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Moiraine said, &ldquo;I suppose you have.&rdquo; She
looked at him until he dropped his eyes, and even then she stood
considering. Finally she turned to the others. &ldquo;There are limits to
the Dark One&rsquo;s power inside you. Yield even for an instant and he
will have a string tied to your heart, a string you may never be
able to cut. Surrender, and you will be his. Deny him, and his
power fails. It is not easy when he touches your dreams, but it can
be done. He can still send Halfmen against you, and Trollocs, and
Draghkar, and other things, but he cannot make you his unless you
let him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fades are bad enough,&rdquo; Perrin said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want him inside my head again,&rdquo; Mat growled.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there any way to keep him out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine shook her head. &ldquo;Loial has nothing to fear,
nor Egwene, nor Nynaeve. Out of the mass of humanity, the Dark One
can touch an individual only by chance, unless that person seeks
it. But for a time, at least, you three are central to the Pattern.
A Web of Destiny is being woven, and every thread leads straight to
you. What else did the Dark One say to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember it all that well,&rdquo; Perrin said.
&ldquo;There was something about one of us being chosen, something like
that. I remember him laughing,&rdquo; he finished bleakly, &ldquo;about who we
were chosen by. He said I&mdash;we could serve him or die. And
then we&rsquo;d still serve him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said the Amyrlin Seat would try to use us,&rdquo; Mat
added, his voice fading as he remembered to whom he was speaking.
He swallowed and went on. &ldquo;He said just like Tar Valon used&mdash;he had some names. Davian, I think. I can&rsquo;t remember very well,
either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Raolin Darksbane,&rdquo; Perrin said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Rand said, frowning. He had tried to forget
everything about those dreams. It was unpleasant bringing them
back. &ldquo;Yurian Stonebow was another, and Guaire Amalasan.&rdquo; He
stopped suddenly, hoping Moiraine had not noticed how suddenly. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t recognize any of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he had recognized one, now that he dredged them
from the depths of memory. The name he had barely stopped himself
from saying. Logain. The false Dragon. <em>Light! Thom said they
were dangerous names. Is that what Ba&rsquo;alzamon meant? Moiraine wants
to use one of us as a false Dragon? Aes Sedai hunt</em> down
<em>false Dragons, they don&rsquo;t rule them. Do they? Light help me, do
they?</em></p>

<p>Moiraine was looking at him, but he could not read
her face. &ldquo;Do you know them?&rdquo; he asked her. &ldquo;Do they mean
anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Father of Lies is a good name for the Dark One,&rdquo;
Moiraine replied. &ldquo;It was always his way to seed the worm of doubt
wherever he could. It eats at men&rsquo;s minds like a canker. When you
believe the Father of Lies, it is the first step toward surrender.
Remember, if you surrender to the Dark One, he will make you
his.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>An Aes Sedai never lies, but the truth she speaks
may not be the truth you think you hear</em>. That was what Tam had
said, and she had not really answered his question. He kept his
face expressionless and held his hands still on his knees, trying
not to scrub the sweat off them on his breeches.</p>

<p>Egwene was crying softly. Nynaeve had her arms around
her, but she looked as if she wanted to cry, too. Rand almost
wished he could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are <em>all</em> <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>,&rdquo; Loial said
abruptly. He seemed brightened by the prospect, looking forward to
watching from close by as the Pattern wove itself around them. Rand
looked at him incredulously, and the Ogier gave an abashed shrug,
but it was not enough to dim his eagerness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So they are,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;<em>Three</em> of
them, when I expected one. A great many things have happened that I
did not expect. This news concerning the Eye of the World changes
much.&rdquo; She paused, frowning. &ldquo;For a time the Pattern does seem to
be swirling around all three of you, just as Loial says, and the
swirl will grow greater before it becomes less. Sometimes being
<em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> means the Pattern is forced to bend to you, and
sometimes it means the Pattern forces you to the needed path. The
Web can still be woven many ways, and some of those designs would
be disastrous. For you, for the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We cannot remain in Caemlyn, but by any road,
Myrddraal and Trollocs will be on us before we have gone ten miles.
And just at this point we hear of a threat to the Eye of the World,
not from one source, but three, each seeming independent of the
others. The Pattern is forcing our path. The Pattern still weaves
itself around you three, but what hand now sets the warp, and what
hand controls the shuttle? Has the Dark One&rsquo;s prison weakened
enough for him to exert that much control?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for that kind of talk!&rdquo; Nynaeve said
sharply. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll only frighten them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But not you?&rdquo; Moiraine asked. &ldquo;It frightens me.
Well, perhaps you are right. Fear cannot be allowed to affect our
course. Whether this is a trap or a timely warning, we must do what
we must, and that is to reach the Eye of the World quickly. The
Green Man must know of this threat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand gave a start. <em>The Green Man?</em> The others
stared, too, all but Loial, whose broad face looked worried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot even risk stopping in Tar Valon for help,&rdquo;
Moiraine continued. &ldquo;Time traps us. Even if we could ride out of
the city unhindered, it would take many weeks to reach the Blight,
and I fear we no longer have weeks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Blight!&rdquo; Rand heard himself echoed in a chorus,
but Moiraine ignored them all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Pattern presents a crisis, and at the same time
a way to surmount it. If I did not know it was impossible, I could
almost believe the Creator is taking a hand. There is a way.&rdquo; She
smiled as if at a private joke, and turned to Loial. &ldquo;There was an
Ogier grove here at Caemlyn, and a Waygate. The New City now
spreads out over where the grove once stood, so the Waygate must be
inside the walls. I know not many Ogier learn the Ways now, but one
who has a Talent and learns the old Songs of Growing must be drawn
to such knowledge, even if he believes it will never be used. Do
you know the Ways, Loial?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Ogier shifted his feet uneasily. &ldquo;I do, Aes
Sedai, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you find the path to Fal Dara along the
Ways?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard of Fal Dara,&rdquo; Loial said, sounding
relieved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the days of the Trolloc Wars it was known as
Mafal Dadaranell. Do you know <em>that</em> name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; Loial said reluctantly, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you can find the path for us,&rdquo; Moiraine said.
&ldquo;A curious turn, indeed. When we can neither stay nor leave by any
ordinary means, I learn of a threat to the Eye, and in the same
place there is one who can take us there in days. Whether it is the
Creator, or fate, or even the Dark One, the Pattern has chosen our
path for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Loial said, an emphatic rumble like thunder.
Everyone turned to look at him and he blinked under the attention,
but there was nothing hesitant about his words. &ldquo;If we enter the
Ways, we will all die&mdash;or be swallowed by the Shadow.&rdquo;</p>
