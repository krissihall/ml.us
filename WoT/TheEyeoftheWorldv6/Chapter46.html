<h4><em>Fal Dara</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
country around the Waygate was rolling, forested
hills, but aside from the gates themselves there was no sign of any
Ogier grove. Most of the trees were gray skeletons clawing at the
sky. Fewer evergreens than Rand was used to dotted the forest, and
of them, dead, brown needles and leaves covered many. Loial made no
comment beyond a sad shaking of his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As dead as the Blasted Lands,&rdquo; Nynaeve said,
frowning. Egwene pulled her cloak around her and shivered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least we&rsquo;re out,&rdquo; Perrin said, and Mat added,
&ldquo;Out where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shienar,&rdquo; Lan told them. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in the Borderlands.&rdquo;
In his hard voice was a note that said home, almost.</p>

<p>Rand gathered his cloak against the cold. The
Borderlands. Then the Blight was close by. The Blight. The Eye of
the World. And what they had come to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are close to Fal Dara,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;Only a
few miles.&rdquo; Across the treetops, towers rose to the north and east
of them, dark against the morning sky. Between the hills and the
woods, the towers often vanished as they rode, only to reappear
again when they topped a particularly tall rise.</p>

<p>Rand noticed trees split open as if struck by
lightning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cold,&rdquo; Lan answered when he asked. &ldquo;Sometimes
the winter is so cold here the sap freezes, and trees burst. There
are nights when you can hear them cracking like fireworks, and the
air is so sharp you think that might shatter, too. There are more
than usual, this winter past.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shook his head. Trees <em>bursting</em>? And
that was during an ordinary winter. What must this winter have been
like? Surely like nothing he could imagine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who says winter&rsquo;s past?&rdquo; Mat said, his teeth
chattering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why this, a fine spring, sheepherder,&rdquo; Lan said. &ldquo;A
fine spring to be alive. But if you want warm, well, it will be
warm in the Blight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Softly Mat muttered, &ldquo;Blood and ashes. Blood and
bloody ashes!&rdquo; Rand barely heard him, but it sounded heartfelt.</p>

<p>They began to pass farms, but though it was the hour
for midday meals to be cooking, no smoke rose from the high stone
chimneys. The fields were empty of men and livestock both, though
sometimes a plow or a wagon stood abandoned as if the owner meant
to be back any minute.</p>

<p>At one farm close by the road a lone chicken
scratched in the yard. One barn door swung freely with the wind;
the other had broken off the bottom hinge and hung at an angle. The
tall house, odd to Rand&rsquo;s Two Rivers eyes, with its sharp-peaked
roof of big wooden shingles running almost to the ground, was still
and silent. No dog came out to bark at them. A scythe lay in the
middle of the barnyard; buckets were overturned in a heap beside
the well.</p>

<p>Moiraine frowned at the farmhouse as they rode by.
She lifted Aldieb&rsquo;s reins, and the white mare quickened her
pace.</p>

<p>The Emond&rsquo;s Fielders were clustered with Loial a
little behind the Aes Sedai and the Warder.</p>

<p>Rand shook his head. He could not imagine anything
growing there ever. But then he could not really imagine the Ways,
either. Even now that he was past them, he could not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she expected this,&rdquo; Nynaeve said
quietly, with a gesture that took in all the empty farms they had
seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did they all go?&rdquo; Egwene said. &ldquo;Why? They
can&rsquo;t have been gone very long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What makes you say that?&rdquo; Mat asked. &ldquo;From the look
of that barn door, they could have been gone all winter.&rdquo; Nynaeve
and Egwene both looked at him as if he were slow-witted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The curtains in the windows,&rdquo; Egwene said patiently.
&ldquo;They look too light for winter curtains, even here. As cold as it
is here, no woman would have had those up more than a week or two,
maybe less.&rdquo; The Wisdom nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Curtains.&rdquo; Perrin chuckled. He immediately wiped the
smile off his face when the two women raised their eyebrows at him.
&ldquo;Oh, I agree with you. There wasn&rsquo;t enough rust on that scythe for
any more than a week in the open. You should have seen that, Mat.
Even if you missed the curtains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand glanced sideways at Perrin, trying not to stare.
His eyes were sharper than Perrin&rsquo;s&mdash;or had been, when they
used to hunt rabbits together&mdash;but he had not been able to
see that scythe-blade well enough to make out any rust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t care where they went,&rdquo; Mat grumbled.
&ldquo;I just want to find someplace with a fire. Soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why did they go?&rdquo; Rand said under his breath.
The Blight was not far off here. The Blight, where all the Fades
and Trollocs were, those not down in Andor chasing them. The
Blight, where they were going.</p>

<p>He raised his voice enough to be heard by those close
to him. &ldquo;Nynaeve, maybe you and Egwene don&rsquo;t have to go to the Eye
with us.&rdquo; The two women looked at him as if he were speaking
gibberish, but with the Blight so close he had to make one last
try. &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s enough for you to be close. Moiraine didn&rsquo;t say
you have to go. Or you, Loial. You could stay at Fal Dara. Until we
come back. Or you could start for Tar Valon. Maybe there&rsquo;ll be a
merchant train, or I&rsquo;ll bet Moiraine would even hire a coach. We
will meet in Tar Valon, when it&rsquo;s all over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Ta&rsquo;veren</em>.&rdquo; Loial&rsquo;s sigh was a rumble like
thunder on the horizon. &ldquo;You swirl lives around you, Rand al&rsquo;Thor,
you and your friends. Your fate chooses ours.&rdquo; The Ogier shrugged,
and suddenly a broad grin split his face. &ldquo;Besides, it will be
something to meet the Green Man. Elder Haman always talks about his
meeting with the Green Man, and so does my father, and most of the
Elders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So many?&rdquo; Perrin said. &ldquo;The stories say the Green
Man is hard to find, and no one can find him twice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not twice, no,&rdquo; Loial agreed. &ldquo;But then, I have
never met him, and neither have you. He doesn&rsquo;t seem to avoid Ogier
quite the way he does you humans. He knows so much about trees.
Even the Tree Songs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand said, &ldquo;The point I was trying to make is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Wisdom cut him off. &ldquo;<em>She</em> says Egwene and
I are part of the Pattern, too. All woven in with you three. If she
is to be believed, there&rsquo;s something about the way that piece of
the Pattern is woven that might stop the Dark One. And I am afraid
I do believe her; too much has happened not to. But if Egwene and I
go away, what might we change about the Pattern?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was only trying to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Nynaeve interrupted, sharply. &ldquo;I know what you
were trying to do.&rdquo; She looked at him until he shifted uneasily in
his saddle, then her face softened. &ldquo;I know what you were trying to
do, Rand. I have little liking for any Aes Sedai, and this one
least of all, I think. I have less for going into the Blight, but
least of all is the liking I have for the Father of Lies. If you
boys&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;you men, can do what has to be done when you&rsquo;d rather do
almost anything else, why do you think I will do less? Or Egwene?&rdquo;
She did not appear to expect an answer. Gathering her reins, she
frowned toward the Aes Sedai up ahead. &ldquo;I wonder if we&rsquo;re going to
reach this Fal Dara place soon, or does she mean us to spend the
night out in this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she trotted toward Moiraine, Mat said, &ldquo;She called
us men. It seems like only yesterday she was saying we shouldn&rsquo;t be
off leading strings, and now she calls us men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You still shouldn&rsquo;t be off your mother&rsquo;s apron
strings,&rdquo; Egwene said, but Rand did not think her heart was in it.
She moved Bela close to his bay, and lowered her voice so none of
the others could hear although Mat, at least, tried. &ldquo;I only danced
with Aram, Rand,&rdquo; she said softly, not looking at him. &ldquo;You
wouldn&rsquo;t hold it against me, dancing with somebody I will never see
again, would you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he told her. <em>What had made her bring it up
now?</em> &ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo; But suddenly he remembered something Min
had said in Baerlon, what seemed a hundred years ago. <em>She&rsquo;s not
for you, nor you for her; at least, not in the way you both
want</em>.</p>

<p>The town of Fal Dara was built on hills higher than
the surrounding country. It was nowhere near as big as Caemlyn, but
the wall around it was as high as Caemlyn&rsquo;s. For a full mile
outside that wall in every direction the ground was clear of
anything taller than grass, and that cut low. Nothing could come
close without being seen from one of the many tall towers topped by
wooden hoardings. Where the walls of Caemlyn had a beauty about
them, the builders of Fal Dara seemed not to have cared if anyone
found their wall beautiful. The gray stone was grimly implacable,
proclaiming that it existed for one purpose alone: to hold.
Pennants atop the hoardings whipped in the wind, making the
stooping Black Hawk of Shienar seem to fly all along the walls.</p>

<p>Lan tossed back the hood of his cloak and, despite
the cold, motioned for the others to do the same. Moiraine had
already lowered hers. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the law in Shienar,&rdquo; the Warder said.
&ldquo;In all the Borderlands. No one may hide his face inside a town&rsquo;s
walls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are they all that good-looking?&rdquo; Mat laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Halfman can&rsquo;t hide with his face exposed,&rdquo; the
Warder said in a flat voice.</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s grin slid off his face. Hastily Mat pushed
back his hood.</p>

<p>The gates stood open, tall and covered with dark
iron, but a dozen armored men stood guard in golden yellow surcoats
bearing the Black Hawk. The hilts of long swords on their backs
peeked over their shoulders, and broadsword or mace or axe hung at
every waist. Their horses were tethered nearby, made grotesque by
the steel bardings covering chests and necks and heads, with lances
to stirrup, all ready to ride at an instant. The guards made no
move to stop Lan and Moiraine and the others. Indeed, they waved
and called out happily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dai Shan!&rdquo; one cried, shaking steel-gauntleted fists
over his head as they rode past. &ldquo;Dai Shan!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A number of others shouted, &ldquo;Glory to the Builders!&rdquo;
and, &ldquo;<em>Kiserai ti Wansho!</em>&rdquo; Loial looked surprised, then a
broad smile split his face and he waved to the guards.</p>

<p>One man ran alongside Lan&rsquo;s horse a little way,
unhampered by the armor he wore. &ldquo;Will the Golden Crane fly again,
Dai Shan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peace, Ragan,&rdquo; was all the Warder said, and the man
fell away. He returned the guards&rsquo; waves, but his face was suddenly
even more grim.</p>

<p>As they rode through stone-paved streets crowded with
people and wagons, Rand frowned worriedly. Fal Dara was bulging at
the seams, but the people were neither the eager crowds of Caemlyn,
enjoying the grandeur of the city even as they squabbled, nor the
milling throngs of Baerlon. Packed cheek by jowl, these folk
watched their party ride by with leaden eyes and faces blanked of
emotion. Carts and wagons jammed every alleyway and half the
streets, piled high with jumbled household furnishings, and carved
chests packed so tight that clothes spilled. On top sat the
children. Adults kept the younglings up where they could be seen
and did not let them stray even to play. The children were even
more silent than their elders, their eyes bigger, more haunting in
their stares. The nooks and crannies between the wagons were filled
with shaggy cattle and black-spotted pigs in makeshift pens. Crates
of chickens and ducks and geese fitfully made up for the silence of
the people. He knew now where all the farmers had gone.</p>

<p>Lan led the way to the fortress in the middle of the
town, a massive stone pile atop the highest hill. A dry moat, deep
and wide, its bottom a forest of sharp steel spikes, razor-edged
and as tall as a man, surrounded the towered walls of the keep. A
place for a last defense, if the rest of the town fell. From one of
the gate towers an armored man called down, &ldquo;Welcome, Dai Shan.&rdquo;
Another shouted to the inside of the fortress, &ldquo;The Golden Crane!
The Golden Crane!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their hooves drummed on the heavy timbers of the
lowered drawbridge as they crossed the moat and rode under the
sharp points of the stout portcullis. Once through the gates, Lan
swung down out of his saddle to lead Mandarb, signaling the others
to dismount.</p>

<p>The first courtyard was a huge square paved with big
stone blocks and surrounded by towers and battlements as fierce as
those on the outside of the walls. As big as it was, the courtyard
appeared just as crowded as the streets, and as much in turmoil,
though there was an order to the crowding here. Everywhere were
armored men and armored horses. At half a dozen smithies around the
court, hammers clanged, and big bellows, tugged by two
leather-aproned men apiece, made the forge-fires roar. A steady
stream of boys ran with new-made horseshoes for the farriers.
Fletchers sat making arrows, and every time a basket was filled it
was whisked away and replaced with an empty one.</p>

<p>Liveried grooms appeared on the run, eager and
smiling in black-and-gold. Rand hastily untied his belongings from
behind the saddle and gave the bay up to one of the grooms as a man
in plate-and-mail and leather bowed formally. He wore a bright
yellow cloak edged in red over his armor, with the Black Hawk on
the breast, and a yellow surcoat bearing a gray owl. He wore no
helmet and was bareheaded, truly, for his hair had all been shaved
except for a topknot tied with a leather cord. &ldquo;It has been long,
Moiraine Aes Sedai. It is good to see you, Dai Shan. Very good.&rdquo; He
bowed again, to Loial, and murmured, &ldquo;Glory to the Builders.
<em>Kiserai ti Wansho</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am unworthy,&rdquo; Loial replied formally, &ldquo;and the
work small. <em>Tsingu ma choba</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You honor us, Builder,&rdquo; the man said. &ldquo;<em>Kiserai
ti Wansho</em>.&rdquo; He turned back to Lan. &ldquo;Word was sent to Lord
Agelmar, Dai Shan, as soon as you were seen coming. He is waiting
for you. This way, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As they followed him into the fortress, along drafty
stone corridors hung with colorful tapestries and long silk screens
of hunting scenes and battles, he continued. &ldquo;I am glad the call
reached you, Dai Shan. Will you raise the Golden Crane banner once
more?&rdquo; The halls were stark except for the wall hangings, and even
they used the fewest figures made with the fewest lines necessary
to convey meaning, though in bright colors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are things really as bad as they appear, Ingtar?&rdquo;
Lan asked quietly. Rand wondered if his own ears were twitching
like Loial&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The man&rsquo;s topknot swayed as he shook his head, but he
hesitated before putting on a grin. &ldquo;Things are never as bad as
they appear, Dai Shan. A little worse than usual this year, that is
all. The raids continued through the winter, even in the hardest of
it. But the raiding was no worse than anywhere else along the
Border. They still come in the night, but what else can be expected
in the spring, if this can be called spring. Scouts return from the
Blight&mdash;those who do come back&mdash;with news of Trolloc camps. Always
fresh news of more camps. But we will meet them at Tarwin&rsquo;s Gap,
Dai Shan, and turn them back as we always have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Lan said, but he did not sound
certain.</p>

<p>Ingtar&rsquo;s grin slipped, but came back immediately.
Silently he showed them into Lord Agelmar&rsquo;s study, then claimed the
press of his duties and left.</p>

<p>It was a room as purpose-made as all the rest of the
fortress, with arrowslits in the outer wall and a heavy bar for the
thick door, which had its own arrowpiercings and was bound by iron
straps. Only one tapestry hung here. It covered an entire wall and
showed men, armored like the men of Fal Dara, fighting Myrddraal
and Trollocs in a mountain pass.</p>

<p>A table, one chest, and a few chairs were the only
furnishings except for two racks on the wall, and they caught
Rand&rsquo;s eye as much as the tapestry. One held a two-handed sword,
taller than a man, a more ordinary broadsword, and below them a
studded mace and a long, kite-shaped shield bearing three foxes.
From the other hung a suit of armor, complete and arranged as one
would wear it. Crested helmet with its barred face-guard over a
double-mail camail. Mail hauberk, split for riding, and leather
undercoat, polished from wear. Breastplate, steel gauntlets, knee
and elbow cops, and half-plate for shoulders and arms and legs.
Even here in the heart of the Keep, weapons and armor seemed ready
to be donned at any moment. Like the furniture, they were simply
and severely decorated with gold.</p>

<p>Agelmar himself rose at their entrance and came
around the table, littered with maps and sheafs of paper and pens
standing in inkpots. He seemed at first glance too peaceful for the
room in his blue velvet coat with its tall, wide collar, and soft
leather boots, but a second look showed Rand differently. Like all
the fighting men he had seen, Agelmar&rsquo;s head was shaved except for
a topknot, and that pure white. His face was as hard as Lan&rsquo;s, the
only lines creases at the corners of his eyes, and those eyes like
brown stone, though they bore a smile now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peace, but it is good to see you, Dai Shan,&rdquo; the
Lord of Fal Dara said. &ldquo;And you, Moiraine Aes Sedai, perhaps even
more. Your presence warms me, Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Ninte calichniye no domashita, Agelmar Dai
Shan</em>,&rdquo; Moiraine replied formally, but with a note in her voice
that said they were old friends. &ldquo;Your welcome warms me, Lord
Agelmar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Kodome calichniye ga ni Aes Sedai hei</em>. Here
is always a welcome for Aes Sedai.&rdquo; He turned to Loial. &ldquo;You are
far from the <em>stedding</em>, Ogier, but you honor Fal Dara.
Always glory to the Builders. <em>Kiserai ti Wansho hei</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am unworthy,&rdquo; Loial said, bowing. &ldquo;It is you who
do me honor.&rdquo; He glanced at the stark stone walls and seemed to
struggle with himself. Rand was glad the Ogier managed to refrain
from adding further comment.</p>

<p>Servants in black-and-gold appeared on silent,
soft-slippered feet. Some brought folded cloths, damp and hot, on
silver trays for wiping the dust from faces and hands. Others bore
mulled wine and silver bowls of dried plums and apricots. Lord
Agelmar gave orders for rooms to be prepared, and baths.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A long journey from Tar Valon,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You must
be tired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A short journey the path we came,&rdquo; Lan told him,
&ldquo;but more tiring than the long way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Agelmar looked puzzled when the Warder said no more,
but he merely said, &ldquo;A few days&rsquo; rest will put you all in fine
fettle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ask one night&rsquo;s shelter, Lord Agelmar,&rdquo; Moiraine
said, &ldquo;for ourselves and our horses. And fresh supplies in the
morning, if you can spare them. We must leave you early, I am
afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Agelmar frowned. &ldquo;But I thought&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Moiraine Sedai,
I have no right to ask it of you, but you would be worth a thousand
lances in Tarwin&rsquo;s Gap. And you, Dai Shan. A thousand men
<em>will</em> come when they hear the Golden Crane flies once
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Seven Towers are broken,&rdquo; Lan said harshly, &ldquo;and
Malkier is dead; the few of her people left, scattered across the
face of the earth. I am a Warder, Agelmar, sworn to the Flame of
Tar Valon, and I am bound into the Blight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, Dai Sh&mdash;Lan. Of course. But surely a
few days&rsquo; delay, a few weeks at most, will make no difference. You
are needed. You, and Moiraine Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine took a silver goblet from one of the
servants. &ldquo;Ingtar seems to believe you will defeat this threat as
you have defeated many others across the years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Agelmar said wryly, &ldquo;if Ingtar had to
ride alone to Tarwin&rsquo;s Gap, he would ride the whole way proclaiming
that the Trollocs would be turned back once more. He has almost
pride enough to believe he <em>could</em> do it alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is not as confident as you think, this time,
Agelmar.&rdquo; The Warder held a cup, but he did not drink. &ldquo;How bad is
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Agelmar hesitated, pulling a map from the tangle on
the table. He stared unseeing at the map for a moment, then tossed
it back. &ldquo;When we ride to the Gap,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;the people
will be sent south to Fal Moran. Perhaps the capital can hold.
Peace, it must. Something must hold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That bad?&rdquo; Lan said, and Agelmar nodded wearily.</p>

<p>Rand exchanged worried looks with Mat and Perrin. It
was easy to believe the Trollocs gathering in the Blight were after
him, after them. Agelmar went on grimly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kandor, Arafel, Saldaea&mdash;the Trollocs raided
them all straight through the winter. Nothing like that has
happened since the Trolloc Wars; the raids have never been so
fierce, or so large, or pressed home so hard. Every king and
council is sure a great thrust is coming out of the Blight, and
every one of the Borderlands believes it is coming at them. None of
their scouts, and none of the Warders, report Trolloc massing above
their borders, as we have here, but they believe, and each is
afraid to send fighting men elsewhere. People whisper that the
world is ending, that the Dark one is loose again. Shienar will
ride to Tarwin&rsquo;s Gap alone, and we will be outnumbered at least ten
to one. At least. It may be the last Ingathering of the
Lances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lan&mdash;no!&mdash;Dai Shan, for you <em>are</em>
a Diademed Battle Lord of Malkier whatever you say. Dai Shan, the
Golden Crane banner in the van would put heart into men who know
they are riding north to die. The word will spread like wildfire,
and though their kings have told them to hold where they are,
lances will come from Arafel and Kandor, and even from Saldaea.
Though they cannot come in time to stand with us in the Gap, they
may save Shienar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan peered into his wine. His face did not change,
but wine slopped over his hand; the silver goblet crumpled in his
grip. A servant took the ruined cup and wiped the Warder&rsquo;s hand
with a cloth; a second put a fresh goblet in his hand while the
other was whisked away. Lan did not seem to notice. &ldquo;I cannot!&rdquo; he
whispered hoarsely. When he raised his head his blue eyes burned
with a fierce light, but his voice was calm again, and flat. &ldquo;I am
a Warder, Agelmar.&rdquo; His sharp gaze slid across Rand and Mat and
Perrin to Moiraine. &ldquo;At first light I ride to the Blight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Agelmar sighed heavily. &ldquo;Moiraine Sedai, will you not
come, at least? An Aes Sedai could make the difference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot, Lord Agelmar.&rdquo; Moiraine seemed troubled.
&ldquo;There is indeed a battle to be fought, and it is not chance that
the Trollocs gather above Shienar, but our battle, the true battle
with the Dark One, will take place in the Blight, at the Eye of the
World. You must fight your battle, and we ours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot be saying he is loose!&rdquo; Rocklike Agelmar
sounded shaken, and Moiraine quickly shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet. If we win at the Eye of the World, perhaps
not ever again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you even find the Eye, Aes Sedai? If holding the
Dark One depends on that, we might as well be dead. Many have tried
and failed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can find it, Lord Agelmar. Hope is not lost
yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Agelmar studied her, and then the others. He appeared
puzzled by Nynaeve and Egwene; their farmclothes contrasted sharply
with Moiraine&rsquo;s silk dress, though all were travel-stained. &ldquo;They
are Aes Sedai, too?&rdquo; he asked doubtfully. When Moiraine shook her
head, he seemed even more confused. His gaze ran over the young men
from Emond&rsquo;s Field, settling on Rand, brushing the red-wrapped
sword at his waist. &ldquo;A strange guard you take with you, Aes Sedai.
Only one fighting man.&rdquo; He glanced at Perrin, and at the axe
hanging from his belt. &ldquo;Perhaps two. But both barely more than
lads. Let me send men with you. A hundred lances more or less will
make no difference in the Gap, but you will need more than one
Warder and three youths. And two women will not help, unless they
are Aiel in disguise. The Blight is worse than usual this year. It&mdash;stirs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A hundred lances would be too many,&rdquo; Lan said, &ldquo;and
a thousand not enough. The larger the party we take into the
Blight, the more chance we will attract attention. We must reach
the Eye without fighting, if we can. You know the outcome is all
but foretold when Trollocs force battle inside the Blight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Agelmar nodded grimly, but he refused to give up.
&ldquo;Fewer, then. Even ten good men would give you a better chance of
escorting Moiraine Sedai and the other two women to the Green Man
than will just these young fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand abruptly realized the Lord of Fal Dara assumed
it was Nynaeve and Egwene who with Moiraine would fight against the
Dark One. It was unnatural. That sort of struggle meant using the
One Power, and that meant women. <em>That sort of struggle means
using the Power</em>. He tucked his thumbs behind his sword belt
and gripped the buckle hard to keep his hands from shaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No men,&rdquo; Moiraine said. Agelmar opened his mouth
again, and she went on before he could speak. &ldquo;It is the nature of
the Eye, and the nature of the Green Man. How many from Fal Dara
have ever found the Green Man and the Eye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ever?&rdquo; Agelmar shrugged. &ldquo;Since the War of the
Hundred Years, you could count them on the fingers of one hand. No
more than one in five years from all the Borderlands together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one finds the Eye of the World,&rdquo; Moiraine said,
&ldquo;unless the Green Man wants them to find it. Need is the key, and
intention. I know where to go&mdash;I have been there before.&rdquo;
Rand&rsquo;s head whipped around in surprise; his was not the only one
among the Emond&rsquo;s Fielders, but the Aes Sedai did not seem to
notice. &ldquo;But one among us seeking glory, seeking to add his name to
those four, and we may never find it though I take us straight to
the spot I remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have seen the Green Man, Moiraine Sedai?&rdquo; The
Lord of Fal Dara sounded impressed, but in the next breath he
frowned. &ldquo;But if you have already met him once&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Need is the key,&rdquo; Moiraine said softly, &ldquo;and there
can be no greater need than mine. Than ours. And I have something
those other seekers have not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes barely stirred from Agelmar&rsquo;s face, but Rand
was sure they had drifted toward Loial, just for an instant before
the Aes Sedai pulled them back. Rand met the Ogier&rsquo;s eyes, and
Loial shrugged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Ta&rsquo;veren</em>,&rdquo; the Ogier said softly.</p>

<p>Agelmar threw up his hands. &ldquo;It will be as you say,
Aes Sedai. Peace, if the real battle is to be at the Eye of the
World, I am tempted to take the Black Hawk banner after you instead
of to the Gap. I could cut a path for you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be disaster, Lord Agelmar. Both at
Tarwin&rsquo;s Gap and at the Eye. You have your battle, and we
ours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peace! As you say, Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having reached a decision, however much he disliked
it, the shaven-headed Lord of Fal Dara seemed to put it out of his
mind. He invited them to table with him, all the while making
conversation about hawks and horses and dogs, but with never a
mention of Trollocs, or Tarwin&rsquo;s Gap, or the Eye of the World.</p>

<p>The chamber where they ate was as stark and plain as
Lord Agelmar&rsquo;s study had been, with little more furnishing it than
the table and chairs themselves, and they were severe in line and
form. Beautiful, but severe. A big fireplace warmed the room, but
not so much that a man called out hurriedly would be stunned by the
cold outside. Liveried servants brought soup and bread and cheese,
and the talk was of books and music until Lord Agelmar realized the
Emond&rsquo;s Field folk were not talking. Like a good host he asked
gently probing questions designed to bring them out of their
quiet.</p>

<p>Rand soon found himself competing to tell about
Emond&rsquo;s Field and the Two Rivers. It was an effort not to say too
much. He hoped the others were guarding their tongues, Mat
especially. Nynaeve alone held herself back, eating and drinking
silently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a song in the Two Rivers,&rdquo; Mat said.
&ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;Coming Home From Tarwin&rsquo;s Gap.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; He finished hesitantly, as if
suddenly realizing that he was bringing up what they had been
avoiding, but Agelmar handled it smoothly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little wonder. Few lands have not sent men to hold
back the Blight over the years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand looked at Mat and Perrin. Mat silently formed
the word Manetheren.</p>

<p>Agelmar whispered to one of the servants, and while
others cleared the table that man vanished and returned with a
canister, and clay pipes for Lan, Loial, and Lord Agelmar. &ldquo;Two
Rivers tabac,&rdquo; the Lord of Fal Data said as they filled their
pipes. &ldquo;Hard to come by, here, but worth the cost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Loial and the two older men were puffing
contentedly, Agelmar glanced at the Ogier. &ldquo;You seem troubled,
Builder. Not beset by the Longing, I hope. How long have you been
away from the <em>stedding</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not the Longing; I have not been gone such a
time as that.&rdquo; Loial shrugged, and the blue-gray streamer rising
from his pipe made a spiral above the table as he gestured. &ldquo;I
expected&mdash;hoped&mdash;that the grove would still be here.
Some remnant of Mafal Dadaranell, at least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Kiserai ti Wansho</em>,&rdquo; Agelmar murmured. &ldquo;The
Trolloc Wars left nothing but memories, Loial, son of Arent, and
people to build on them. They could not duplicate the Builders&rsquo;
work, any more than could I. Those intricate curves and patterns
your people create are beyond human eyes and hands to make. Perhaps
we wished to avoid a poor imitation that would only have been an
ever-present reminder to us of what we had lost. There is a
different beauty in simplicity, in a single line placed just so, a
single flower among the rocks. The harshness of the stone makes the
flower more precious. We try not to dwell too much on what is gone.
The strongest heart will break under that strain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The rose petal floats on water,&rdquo; Lan recited softly.
&ldquo;The kingfisher flashes above the pond. Life and beauty swirl in
the midst of death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Agelmar said. &ldquo;Yes. That one has always
symbolized the whole of it to me, too.&rdquo; The two men bowed their
heads to one another.</p>

<p><em>Poetry out of Lan?</em> The man was like an
onion; every time Rand thought he knew something about the Warder,
he discovered another layer underneath.</p>

<p>Loial nodded slowly. &ldquo;Perhaps I also dwell too much
on what is gone. And yet, the groves were beautiful.&rdquo; But he was
looking at the stark room as if seeing it anew, and suddenly
finding things worth seeing.</p>

<p>Ingtar appeared and bowed to Lord Agelmar. &ldquo;Your
pardon, Lord, but you wanted to know of anything out of the
ordinary, however small.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, what is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A small thing, Lord. A stranger tried to enter the
town. Not of Shienar. By his accent, a Lugarder. Sometimes, at
least. When the South Gate guards attempted to question him, he ran
away. He was seen to enter the forest, but only a short time later
he was found scaling the wall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A small thing!&rdquo; Agelmar&rsquo;s chair scraped across the
floor as he stood. &ldquo;Peace! The tower watch is so negligent a man
can reach the walls unseen, and you call it a small thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a madman, Lord.&rdquo; Awe touched Ingtar&rsquo;s voice.
&ldquo;The Light shields madmen. Perhaps the Light cloaked the tower
watch&rsquo;s eyes and allowed him to reach the walls. Surely one poor
madman can do no harm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has he been brought to the keep yet? Good. Bring him
to me here. Now.&rdquo; Ingtar bowed and left, and Agelmar turned to
Moiraine. &ldquo;Your pardon, Aes Sedai, but I must see to this. Perhaps
he is only a pitiful wretch with his mind blinded by the Light, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Two days gone, five of our own people were found in the night
trying to saw through the hinges of a horsegate. Small, but enough
to let Trollocs in.&rdquo; He grimaced. &ldquo;Darkfriends, I suppose, though I
hate to think it of any Shienaran. They were torn to pieces by the
people before the guards could take them, so I&rsquo;ll never know. If
Shienarans can be Darkfriends, I must be especially careful of
outlanders in these days. If you wish to withdraw, I will have you
shown to your rooms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Darkfriends know neither border nor blood,&rdquo; Moiraine
said. &ldquo;They are found in every land, and are <em>of</em> none. I,
too, am interested in seeing this man. The Pattern is forming a
Web, Lord Agelmar, but the final shape of the Web is not yet set.
It may yet entangle the world, or unravel and set the Wheel to a
new weaving. At this point, even small things can change the shape
of the Web. At this point I am wary of small things out of the
ordinary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Agelmar glanced at Nynaeve and Egwene. &ldquo;As you wish,
Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ingtar returned, with two guards carrying long bills,
and escorting a man who looked like a ragbag turned inside out.
Grime layered his face and matted his scraggly, uncut hair and
beard. He hunched into the room, sunken eyes darting this way and
that. A rancid smell wafted ahead of him.</p>

<p>Rand sat forward intently, trying to see through all
the dirt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no cause to be holding me like this,&rdquo; the
filthy man whined. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only a poor destitute, abandoned by the
Light and seeking a place, like everyone else, to shelter from the
Shadow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Borderlands are a strange place to seek&mdash;&rdquo;
Agelmar began, when Mat cut him off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The peddler!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Padan Fain,&rdquo; Perrin agreed, nodding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The beggar,&rdquo; Rand said, suddenly hoarse. He sat back
at the sudden hatred that flared in Fain&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the man who
was asking about us in Caemlyn. He has to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So this concerns you after all, Moiraine Sedai,&rdquo;
Agelmar said slowly.</p>

<p>Moiraine nodded. &ldquo;I greatly fear that it does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo; Fain began to cry. Fat tears cut
runnels in the dirt on his cheeks, but they were unable to reach
the bottom layer. &ldquo;He made me! Him and his burning eyes.&rdquo; Rand
flinched. Mat had his hand under his coat, no doubt clutching the
dagger from Shadar Logoth again. &ldquo;He made me his hound! His hound,
to hunt and follow with never a bit of rest. Only his hound, even
after he threw me away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does concern us all,&rdquo; Moiraine said grimly. &ldquo;Is
there a place where I can talk with him alone, Lord Agelmar?&rdquo; Her
mouth tightened with distaste. &ldquo;And wash him first. I may need to
touch him.&rdquo; Agelmar nodded and spoke softly to Ingtar, who bowed
and disappeared through the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not be compelled!&rdquo; The voice was Fain&rsquo;s, but
he was no longer crying, and an arrogant snap had replaced the
whine. He stood upright, not crouching at all. Throwing back his
head, he shouted at the ceiling. &ldquo;Never again! I&mdash;will&mdash;not!&rdquo; He faced Agelmar as if the men flanking him were his own
bodyguard and the Lord of Fal Dara his equal rather than his
captor. His tone became sleek and oily. &ldquo;There is a
misunderstanding here, Great Lord. I am sometimes taken by spells,
but that will pass soon. Yes, soon I will be rid of them.&rdquo;
Contemptuously he flicked his fingers against the rags he wore. &ldquo;Do
not be misled by these, Great Lord. I have had to disguise myself
against those who have tried to stop me, and my journey has been
long and hard. But at last I have reached lands where men still
know the dangers of Ba&rsquo;alzamon, where men still fight the Dark
One.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stared, goggling. It <em>was</em> Fain&rsquo;s voice,
but the words did not sound like the peddler at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve come here because we fight Trollocs,&rdquo;
Agelmar said. &ldquo;And you are so important that someone wants to stop
you. These people say you are a peddler called Padan Fain, and that
you are following them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fain hesitated. He glanced at Moiraine and hurriedly
pulled his eyes away from the Aes Sedai. His gaze ran across the
Emond&rsquo;s Fielders, then jerked back to Agelmar. Rand felt the hate
in that look, and the fear. When Fain spoke again, though, his
voice was unruffled. &ldquo;Padan Fain is simply one of the many
disguises I have been forced to wear over the years. Friends of the
Dark pursue me, for I have learned how to defeat the Shadow. I can
show you how to defeat him, Great Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do as well as men can,&rdquo; Agelmar said dryly. &ldquo;The
Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills, but we have fought the Dark One
almost since the Breaking of the World without peddlers to teach us
how.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great Lord, your might is unquestioned, but can it
stand against the Dark One forever? Do you not often find yourself
pressed to hold? Forgive my temerity, Great Lord; he will crush you
in the end, as you are. I know; believe me, I do. But I can show
you how to scour the Shadow from the land, Great Lord.&rdquo; His tone
became even more unctuous, though still haughty. &ldquo;If you but try
what I advise, you will see, Great Lord. You will cleanse the land.
You, Great Lord, can do it, if you direct your might in the right
direction. Avoid letting Tar Valon entangle you in its snares, and
you can save the world. Great Lord, you will be the man remembered
through history for bringing final victory to the Light.&rdquo; The
guards held their places, but their hands shifted on the long
shafts of the bills as if they thought they might have to use
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He thinks a great deal of himself for a peddler,&rdquo;
Agelmar said to Lan over his shoulder. &ldquo;I think Ingtar is right. He
is mad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fain&rsquo;s eyes tightened angrily, but his voice remained
smooth. &ldquo;Great Lord, I know my words must appear grandiose, but if
you will only&mdash;&rdquo; He cut off abruptly, stepping back, as
Moiraine rose and started slowly around the table. Only the guards&rsquo;
lowered bills kept Fain from backing right out of the room.</p>

<p>Stopping behind Mat&rsquo;s chair, Moiraine put a hand on
his shoulder and bent to whisper in his ear. Whatever she said, the
tension went out of his face, and he took his hand from under his
coat. The Aes Sedai went on until she stood beside Agelmar,
confronting Fain. As she came to a halt, the peddler sank into a
crouch once more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hate him,&rdquo; he whimpered. &ldquo;I want to be free of
him. I want to walk in the Light again.&rdquo; His shoulders began to
shake, and tears streamed down his face even more heavily than
before. &ldquo;He made me do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid he is more than a peddler, Lord
Agelmar,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;Less than human, worse than vile, more
dangerous than you can imagine. He can be bathed after I have
spoken with him. I dare not waste a minute. Come, Lan.&rdquo;</p>
