<h4><em>Against the Shadow</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
land tended upward the way Rand went, but fear
lent his legs strength and they ate ground in long strides, tearing
his way through flowering bushes and tangles of wildrose,
scattering petals, not caring if thorns ripped his clothes or even
his flesh. Moiraine had stopped screaming. It seemed as if the
shrieks had gone on forever, each one more throat-wrenching than
the last, but he knew they had lasted only moments altogether.
Moments before Aginor would be on his trail. He knew it would be
him that Aginor followed. He had seen the certainty in the
Forsaken&rsquo;s hollow eyes, in that last second before terror whipped
his feet to run.</p>

<p>The land grew ever steeper, but he scrambled on,
pulling himself forward by handfuls of undergrowth, rocks and dirt
and leaves spilling down the slope from under his feet, finally
crawling on hands and knees when the slant became too great. Ahead,
above, it leveled out a little. Panting, he scrabbled his way the
last few spans, got to his feet, and stopped, wanting to howl
aloud.</p>

<p>Ten paces in front of him, the hilltop dropped away
sharply. He knew what he would see before he reached it, but he
took the steps anyway, each heavier than the one before, hoping
there might be some track, a goat path, anything. At the edge he
looked down a sheer hundred-foot drop, a stone wall as smooth as
planed timber.</p>

<p><em>There has to be some way. I&rsquo;ll go back and find a
way around. Go back and</em>&mdash;</p>

<p>When he turned, Aginor was there, just reaching the
crest. The Forsaken topped the hill without any difficulty, walking
up the steep slope as if it were level ground. Deep-sunken eyes
burned at him from that drawn parchment face; somehow, it seemed
less withered than before, more fleshed, as if Aginor had fed well
on something. Those eyes were fixed on him, yet when Aginor spoke,
it was almost to himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ba&rsquo;alzamon will give rewards beyond mortal dreaming
for the one who brings you to Shayol Ghul. Yet my dreams have
always been beyond those of other men, and I left mortality behind
millennia ago. What difference if you serve the Great Lord of the
Dark alive or dead? None, to the spread of the Shadow. Why should I
share power with you? Why should I bend knee to you? I, who faced
Lews Therin Telamon in the Hall of the Servants itself. I, who
threw my might against the Lord of the Morning and met him stroke
for stroke. I think not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s mouth dried like dust; his tongue felt as
shriveled as Aginor. The edge of the precipice grated under his
heels, stone falling away. He did not dare look back, but he heard
the rocks bounding and rebounding from the sheer wall, just as his
body would if he moved another inch. It was the first he knew that
he had been backing up, away from the Forsaken. His skin crawled
until he thought he must see it writhing if he looked, if he could
only take his eyes off the Forsaken. <em>There has to be some way
to get away from him. Some way to escape! There has to be! Some
way!</em></p>

<p>Suddenly he felt something, saw it, though he knew it
was not there to see. A glowing rope ran off from Aginor, behind
him, white like sunlight seen through the purest cloud, heavier
than a blacksmith&rsquo;s arm, lighter than air, connecting the Forsaken
to something distant beyond knowing, something within the touch of
Rand&rsquo;s hand. The rope pulsed, and with every throb Aginor grew
stronger, more fully fleshed, a man as tall and strong as himself,
a man harder than the Warder, more deadly than the Blight. Yet
beside that shining cord, the Forsaken seemed almost not to exist.
The cord was all. It hummed. It sang. It called Rand&rsquo;s soul. One
bright finger-strand lifted away, drifted, touched him, and he
gasped. Light filled him, and heat that should have burned yet only
warmed as if it took the chill of the grave from his bones. The
strand thickened. <em>I have to get away!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Aginor shouted. &ldquo;You shall not have it! It is
mine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand did not move, and neither did the Forsaken, yet
they fought as surely as if they grappled in the dust. Sweat beaded
on Aginor&rsquo;s face, no longer withered, no longer old, that of a
strong man in his prime. Rand pulsed with the beating in the cord,
like the heartbeat of the world. It filled his being. Light filled
his mind, till only a corner was left for what was himself. He
wrapped the void around that nook; sheltered in emptiness.
<em>Away!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mine!&rdquo; Aginor cried. &ldquo;Mine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Warmth built in Rand, the warmth of the sun, the
radiance of the sun, bursting, the awful radiance of light, of the
Light. <em>Away!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mine!&rdquo; Flame shot from Aginor&rsquo;s mouth, broke through
his eyes like spears of fire, and he screamed.</p>

<p><em>Away!</em></p>

<p>And Rand was no longer on the hilltop. He quivered
with the Light that suffused him. His mind would not work; light
and heat blinded it. The Light. In the midst of the void, the Light
blinded his mind, stunned him with awe.</p>

<p>He stood in a broad mountain pass, surrounded by
jagged black peaks like the teeth of the Dark One. It was real; he
was there. He felt the rocks under his boots, the icy breeze on his
face.</p>

<p>Battle surrounded him, or the tail end of battle.
Armored men on armored horses, shining steel dusty now, slashed and
stabbed at snarling Trollocs wielding spiked axes and scythe-like
swords. Some men fought afoot, their horses down, and barded horses
galloped through the fight with empty saddles. Fades moved among
them all, night-black cloaks hanging still however their dark
mounts galloped, and wherever their light-eating swords swung, men
died. Sound beat at Rand, beat at him and bounced from the
strangeness that had him by the throat. The clash of steel against
steel, the panting and grunting of men and Trollocs striving, the
screams of men and Trollocs dying. Over the din, banners waved in
dust-filled air. The Black Hawk of Fal Dara, the White Hart of
Shienar, others. And Trolloc banners. In just the little space
around him he saw the horned skull of the Dha&rsquo;vol, the blood-red
trident of the Ko&rsquo;bal, the iron fist of the Dhai&rsquo;mon.</p>

<p>Yet it was indeed the tail end of battle, a pausing,
as humans and Trollocs alike fell back to regroup. None seemed to
notice Rand as they paid a few last strokes and broke away,
galloping, or running in a stagger, to the ends of the pass.</p>

<p>Rand found himself facing the end of the pass where
the humans were re-forming, pennants stirring beneath gleaming
lancepoints. Wounded men wavered in their saddles. Riderless horses
reared and galloped. Plainly they could not stand another meeting,
yet just as plainly they readied themselves for one final charge.
Some of them saw him now; men stood in their stirrups to point at
him. Their shouts came to him as tiny piping.</p>

<p>Staggering, he turned. The forces of the Dark One
filled the other end of the pass, bristling black pikes and
spearpoints swelling up onto mountain slopes made blacker still by
the great mass of Trollocs that dwarfed the army of Shienar. Fades
in hundreds rode across the front of the horde, the fierce, muzzled
faces of Trollocs turning away in fear as they passed, huge bodies
pulling back to make way. Overhead, Draghkar wheeled on leathery
pinions, shrieks challenging the wind. Halfmen saw him now, too,
pointed, and Draghkar spun and dove. Two. Three. Six of them,
crying shrilly as they plummeted toward him.</p>

<p>He stared at them. Heat filled him, the burning heat
of the touched sun. He could see the Draghkar clearly, soulless
eyes in pale men&rsquo;s faces on winged bodies that had nothing of
humanity about them. Terrible heat. Crackling heat.</p>

<p>From the clear sky lightning came, each bolt crisp
and sharp, searing his eyes, each bolt striking a winged black
shape. Hunting cries became shrieks of death, and charred forms
fell to leave the sky clean again.</p>

<p>The heat. The terrible heat of the Light.</p>

<p>He fell to his knees; he thought he could hear his
tears sizzling on his cheeks. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; He clutched at tufts of wiry
grass for some hold on reality; the grass burst in flame. &ldquo;Please,
nooooooo!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wind rose with his voice, howled with his voice,
roared with his voice down the pass, whipping the flames to a wall
of fire that sped away from him and toward the Trolloc host faster
than a horse could run. Fire burned into the Trollocs, and the
mountains trembled with their screams, screams almost as loud as
the wind and his voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has to end!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He beat at the ground with his fist, and the earth
tolled like a gong. He bruised his hands on stony soil, and the
earth trembled. Ripples ran through the ground ahead of him in
ever-rising waves, waves of dirt and rock towering over Trollocs
and Fades, breaking over them as the mountains shattered under
their hooved feet. A boiling mass of flesh and rubble churned
across the Trolloc army. What was left standing was still a mighty
host, but now no more than twice the human army in numbers, and
milling in fright and confusion.</p>

<p>The wind died. The screams died. The earth was still.
Dust and smoke swirled back down the pass to surround him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light blind you, Ba&rsquo;alzamon! This has to
end!&rdquo;</p>

<p>IT IS NOT HERE.</p>

<p>It was not Rand&rsquo;s thought, making his skull
vibrate.</p>

<p>I WILL TAKE NO PART. ONLY THE CHOSEN ONE CAN DO WHAT
MUST BE DONE, IF HE WILL.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; He did not want to say it, but he could not
stop himself. &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The haze surrounding him parted, leaving a dome of
clear, clean air ten spans high, walled by billowing smoke and
dust. Steps rose before him, each standing alone and unsupported,
stretching up into the murk that obscured the sun.</p>

<p>NOT HERE.</p>

<p>Through the mist, as from the far end of the earth,
came a cry. &ldquo;The Light wills it!&rdquo; The ground rumbled with the
thunder of hooves as the forces of humankind launched their last
charge.</p>

<p>Within the void, his mind knew a moment of panic. The
charging horsemen could not see him in the dust; their charge would
trample right over him. The greater part of him ignored the shaking
ground as a petty thing beneath concern. Dull anger driving his
feet, he mounted the first steps. <em>It has to be ended!</em></p>

<p>Darkness surrounded him, the utter blackness of total
nothing. The steps were still there, hanging in the black, under
his feet and ahead. When he looked back, those behind were gone,
faded away to nothing, into the nothingness around him. But the
cord was yet there, stretching behind him, the glowing line
dwindling and vanishing into the distance. It was not so thick as
before, but it still pulsed, pumping strength into him, pumping
life, filling him with the Light. He climbed.</p>

<p>It seemed forever that he climbed. Forever, and
minutes. Time stood still in nothingness. Time ran faster. He
climbed until suddenly a door stood before him, its surface rough
and splintered and old, a door well remembered. He touched it, and
it burst to fragments. While they still fell, he stepped through,
bits of shattered wood falling from his shoulders.</p>

<p>The chamber, too, was as he remembered, the mad,
striated sky beyond the balcony, the melted walls, the polished
table, the terrible fireplace with its roaring, heatless flames.
Some of those faces that made the fireplace, writhing in torment,
shrieking in silence, tugged at his memory as if he knew them, but
he held the void close, floated within himself in emptiness. He was
alone. When he looked at the mirror on the wall, his face was there
as clear as if it was him. <em>There is calm in the void</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Ba&rsquo;alzamon said from in front of the
fireplace, &ldquo;I thought Aginor&rsquo;s greed would overcome him. But it
makes no difference in the end. A long search, but ended now. You
are here, and I know you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the midst of the Light the void drifted, and in
the midst of the void floated Rand. He reached for the soil of his
home, and felt hard rock, unyielding and dry, stone without pity,
where only the strong could survive, only those as hard as the
mountains. &ldquo;I am tired of running.&rdquo; He could not believe his voice
was so calm. &ldquo;Tired of you threatening my friends. I will run no
more.&rdquo; Ba&rsquo;alzamon had a cord, too, he saw. A black cord, thicker by
far than his own, so wide it should have dwarfed the human body,
yet dwarfed by Ba&rsquo;alzamon, instead. Each pulse along that black
vein ate light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think it makes any difference, whether you run
or stay?&rdquo; The flames of Ba&rsquo;alzamon&rsquo;s mouth laughed. The faces in
the hearth wept at their master&rsquo;s mirth. &ldquo;You have fled from me
many times, and each time I run you down and make you eat your
pride with sniveling tears for spice. Many times you have stood and
fought, then groveled in defeat, begging mercy. You have this
choice, worm, and this choice only: kneel at my feet and serve me
well, and I will give you power above thrones; or be Tar Valon&rsquo;s
puppet fool and scream while you are ground into the dust of time.
&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shifted, glancing back through the door as if
seeking a way to escape. Let the Dark One think that. Beyond the
doorway was still the black of nothing, split by the shining thread
that ran from his body. And out there Ba&rsquo;alzamon&rsquo;s heavier cord ran
as well, so black that it stood out in the dark as if against snow.
The two cords beat like heart-veins in counter-time, against each
other, the light barely resisting the waves of dark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are other choices,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;The Wheel
weaves the Pattern, not you. Every trap you&rsquo;ve laid for me, I have
escaped. I&rsquo;ve escaped your Fades and Trollocs, escaped your
Darkfriends. I tracked you here, and destroyed your army on the
way. You do not weave the Pattern.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ba&rsquo;alzamon&rsquo;s eyes roared like two furnaces. His lips
did not move, but Rand thought he heard a curse screamed at Aginor.
Then the fires died, and that ordinary human face smiled at him in
a way that chilled even through the warmth of the Light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Other armies can be raised, fool. Armies you have
not dreamed of will yet come. And you tracked me? You, slug under a
rock, track me? I began the setting of your path the day you were
born, a path to lead you to your grave, or here. Aiel allowed to
flee, and one to live, to speak the words that would echo down the
years. Jain Farstrider, a hero,&rdquo; he twisted the word to a sneer,
&ldquo;whom I painted like a fool and sent to the Ogier thinking he was
free of me. The Black Ajah, wriggling like worms on their bellies
across the world to search you out. I pull the strings and the
Amyrlin Seat dances and thinks she controls events.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The void trembled; hastily Rand firmed it again.
<em>He knows it all. He could have done. It could be the way he
says</em>. The Light warmed the void. Doubt cried out and was
stilled, till only the seed remained. He struggled, not knowing
whether he wanted to bury the seed or make it grow. The void
steadied, smaller than before, and he floated in calm.</p>

<p>Ba&rsquo;alzamon seemed to notice nothing. &ldquo;It matters
little if I have you alive or dead, except to you, and to what
power you might have. You will serve me, or your soul will. But I
would rather have you kneel to me alive than dead. A single fist of
Trollocs sent to your village when I could have sent a thousand.
One Darkfriend to face you where a hundred could come on you
asleep. And you, fool, you don&rsquo;t even know them all, neither those
ahead, nor those behind, nor those by your side. You are mine, have
always been mine, my dog on a leash, and I brought you here to
kneel to your master or die and let your soul kneel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I deny you. You have no power over me, and I will
not kneel to you, alive or dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; Ba&rsquo;alzamon said. &ldquo;Look.&rdquo; Unwilling, Rand yet
turned his head.</p>

<p>Egwene stood there, and Nynaeve, pale and frightened,
with flowers in their hair. And another woman, little older than
the Wisdom, gray-eyed and beautiful, clothed in a Two Rivers dress,
bright blossoms embroidered round the neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother?&rdquo; he breathed, and she smiled, a hopeless
smile. His mother&rsquo;s smile. &ldquo;No! My mother is dead, and the other
two are safe away from here. I deny you!&rdquo; Egwene and Nynaeve
blurred, became wafting mist, dissipated. Kari al&rsquo;Thor still stood
there, her eyes big with fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She, at least,&rdquo; Ba&rsquo;alzamon said, &ldquo;is mine to do with
as I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shook his head. &ldquo;I deny you.&rdquo; He had to force
the words out. &ldquo;She is dead, and safe from you in the Light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His mother&rsquo;s lips trembled. Tears trickled down her
cheeks; each one burned him like acid. &ldquo;The Lord of the Grave is
stronger than he once was, my son,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;His reach is longer.
The Father of Lies has a honeyed tongue for unwary souls. My son.
My only, darling son. I would spare you if I could, but he is my
master, now, his whim, the law of my existence. I can but obey him,
and grovel for his favor. Only you can free me. Please, my son.
Please help me. Help me. Help me! PLEASE!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wail ripped out of her as barefaced Fades, pale
and eyeless, closed round. Her clothes ripped away in their
bloodless hands, hands that wielded pincers and clamps and things
that stung and burned and whipped against her naked flesh. Her
scream would not end.</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s scream echoed hers. The void boiled in his
mind. His sword was in his hand. Not the heron-mark blade, but a
blade of light, a blade of the Light. Even as he raised it, a fiery
white bolt shot from the point, as if the blade itself had reached
out. It touched the nearest Fade, and blinding candescence filled
the chamber, shining through the Halfmen like a candle through
paper, burning through them, blinding his eyes to the scene.</p>

<p>From the midst of the brilliance, he heard a whisper.
&ldquo;Thank you, my son. The Light. The blessed Light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The flash faded, and he was alone in the chamber with
Ba&rsquo;alzamon. Ba&rsquo;alzamon&rsquo;s eyes burned like the Pit of Doom, but he
shied back from the sword as if it truly were the Light itself.
&ldquo;Fool! You will destroy yourself! You cannot wield it so, not yet!
Not until I teach you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is ended,&rdquo; Rand said, and he swung the sword at
Ba&rsquo;alzamon&rsquo;s black cord.</p>

<p>Ba&rsquo;alzamon screamed as the sword fell, screamed till
the stone walls trembled, and the endless howl redoubled as the
blade of Light severed the cord. The cut ends rebounded apart as if
they had been under tension. The end stretching into the
nothingness outside began to shrivel as it sprang away; the other
whipped back into Ba&rsquo;alzamon, hurling him against the fireplace.
There was silent laughter in the soundless shrieks of the tortured
faces. The walls shivered and cracked; the floor heaved, and chunks
of stone crashed to the floor from the ceiling.</p>

<p>As all broke apart around him, Rand pointed the sword
at Ba&rsquo;alzamon&rsquo;s heart. &ldquo;It is ended!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Light lanced from the blade, coruscating in a shower
of fiery sparks like droplets of molten, white metal. Wailing,
Ba&rsquo;alzamon threw up his arms in a vain effort to shield himself.
Flames shrieked in his eyes, joining with other flames as the stone
ignited, the stone of the cracking walls, the stone of the pitching
floor, the stone showering from the ceiling. Rand felt the bright
thread attached to him thinning, till only the glow itself
remained, but he strained harder, not knowing what he did, or how,
only that this had to be ended. <em>It</em> has <em>to be ended!</em></p>

<p>Fire filled the chamber, a solid flame. He could see
Ba&rsquo;alzamon withering like a leaf, hear him howling, feel the
shrieks grating on his bones. The flame became pure, white light,
brighter than the sun. Then the last flicker of the thread was
gone, and he was falling through endless black and Ba&rsquo;alzamon&rsquo;s
fading howl.</p>

<p>Something struck him with tremendous force, turning
him to jelly, and the jelly shook and screamed from the fire raging
inside, the hungry cold burning without end.</p>
