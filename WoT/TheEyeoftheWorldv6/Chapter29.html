pushed for speed across the brown grass
flatland as if trying to make up for the time spent with the
Traveling People, setting a pace southward that had even Bela
grateful to stop when twilight deepened. Despite his desire for
haste, though, he took precautions he had not taken before. At
night they had a fire only if there was dead wood already on the
ground. He would not let them break so much as a twig off of a
standing tree. The fires he made were small, and always hidden in a

<p>The land became long, rolling crests, too low to be
called hills, rising across their path. A carpet of tough grass,
still winter sere and dotted with rank weeds, spread before them,
rippled by an east wind th
