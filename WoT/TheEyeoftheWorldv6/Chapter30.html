sat by the fire, staring up at the fragment of
statue, but Perrin went down by the pool to be alone. Day was
fading, and the night wind was already rising out of the east,
ruffling the surface of the water. He took the axe from the loop on
his belt and turned it over in his hands. The ashwood haft was as
long as his arm, and smooth and cool to the touch. He hated it. He
was ashamed of how proud he had been of the axe back in Emond&rsquo;s
Field. Before he knew what he might be willing to do with it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You hate her that much?&rdquo; Elyas said behind him.</p>

<p>Startled, he jumped and half raised the axe before he
saw who it was. &ldquo;Can&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Can you read my mind, too? Like the
wolves?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elyas cocked his head to one side and eyed him
quizzically. &ldquo;A blind man could read your face, boy. Well, speak
up. Do you hate the girl? Despise her? That&rsquo;s it. You were ready to
kill her because you despise her, always dragging her feet, holding
you back with her womanish ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egwene never dragged her feet in her life,&rdquo; he
protested. &ldquo;She always does her share. I don&rsquo;t despise her, I love
her.&rdquo; He glared at Elyas, daring him to laugh. &ldquo;Not like that. I
mean, she isn&rsquo;t like a sister, but she and Rand&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Blood and
ashes! If the ravens caught us&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;If&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you do. If she had to choose her way of dying,
which do you think she&rsquo;d pick? One clean blow of your axe, or the
way the animals we saw today died? I know which I&rsquo;d take.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any right to choose for her. You won&rsquo;t
tell her, will you? About&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; His hands tightened on the axe
haft; the muscles in his arms corded, heavy muscles for his age,
built by long hours swinging the hammer at Master Luhhan&rsquo;s forge.
For an instant he thought the thick wooden shaft would snap. &ldquo;I
hate this bloody thing,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m doing
with it, strutting around like some kind of fool. I couldn&rsquo;t have
done it, you know. When it was all pretend and maybe, I could
swagger, and play as if I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He sighed, his voice fading. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
different, now. I don&rsquo;t ever want to use it again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll use it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin raised the axe to throw it in the pool, but
Elyas caught his wrist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll use it, boy, and as long as you hate using
it, you will use it more wisely than most men would. Wait. If ever
you don&rsquo;t hate it any longer, then will be the time to throw it as
far as you can and run the other way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin hefted the axe in his hands, still tempted to
leave it in the pool. <em>Easy for him to say wait. What if I wait
and then can&rsquo;t throw it away?</em></p>

<p>He opened his mouth to ask Elyas, but no words came
out. A sending from the wolves, so urgent that his eyes glazed
over. For an instant he forgot what he had been going to say,
forgot he had been going to say anything, forgot even how to speak,
how to breathe. Elyas&rsquo;s face sagged, too, and his eyes seemed to
peer inward and far away. Then it was gone, as quickly as it had
come. It had only lasted a heartbeat, but that was enough.</p>

<p>Perrin shook himself and filled his lungs deeply.
Elyas did not pause; as soon as the veil lifted from his eyes, he
sped toward the fire without any hesitation. Perrin ran wordlessly
behind him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Douse the fire!&rdquo; Elyas called hoarsely to Egwene. He
gestured urgently, and he seemed to be trying to shout in a
whisper. &ldquo;Get it out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She rose to her feet, staring at him uncertainly,
then stepped closer to the fire, but slowly, clearly not
understanding what was happening.</p>

<p>Elyas pushed roughly past her and snatched up the tea
kettle, cursing when it burned him. Juggling the hot pot, he
upended it over the fire just the same. A step behind him, Perrin
arrived in time to start kicking dirt over the hissing coals as the
last of the tea splashed into the fire, hissing and rising in
tendrils of steam. He did not stop until the last vestige of the
fire was buried.</p>

<p>Elyas tossed the kettle to Perrin, who immediately
let it fall with a choked-off yell. Perrin blew on his hands,
frowning at Elyas, but the fur-clad man was too busy giving their
campsite a hasty look to pay any attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No chance to hide that somebody&rsquo;s been here,&rdquo; Elyas
said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just have to hurry and hope. Maybe they won&rsquo;t bother.
Blood and ashes, but I was sure it was the ravens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hurriedly Perrin tossed the saddle on Bela, propping
the axe against his thigh while he bent to tighten the girth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Egwene asked. Her voice shook.
&ldquo;Trollocs? A Fade?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go east or west,&rdquo; Elyas told Perrin. &ldquo;Find a place
to hide, and I&rsquo;ll join you as soon as I can. If they see a wolf&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He darted away, crouching almost as if he intended to go to all
fours, and vanished into the lengthening shadows of evening.</p>

<p>Egwene hastily gathered her few belongings, but she
still demanded an explanation from Perrin. Her voice was insistent
and growing more frightened by the minute as he kept silent. He was
frightened, too, but fear made them move faster. He waited until
they were headed toward the setting sun. Trotting ahead of Bela and
holding the axe across his chest in both hands, he told what he
knew over his shoulder in snatches while hunting for a place to go
to ground and wait for Elyas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are a lot of men coming, on horses. They came
up behind the wolves, but the men didn&rsquo;t see them. They&rsquo;re heading
toward the pool. Probably they don&rsquo;t have anything to do with us;
it&rsquo;s the only water for miles. But Dapple says&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He glanced
over his shoulder. The evening sun painted odd shadows on her face,
shadows that hid her expression. <em>What is she thinking? Is she
looking at you as if she doesn&rsquo;t know you anymore? Does she know
you?</em> &ldquo;Dapple says they smell wrong. It&rsquo;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;sort of the way
a rabid dog smells wrong.&rdquo; The pool was lost to sight behind them.
He could still pick out boulders&mdash;fragments of Artur
Hawkwing&rsquo;s statue&mdash;in the deepening twilight, but not to tell
which was the stone where the fire had been. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stay away from
them, find a place to wait for Elyas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should they bother us?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
supposed to be safe here. It&rsquo;s supposed to be safe. Light, there
has to be some place safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin began looking harder for somewhere to hide.
They could not be very far from the pool, but the twilight was
thickening. Soon it would be too dark to travel. Faint light still
bathed the crests. From the hollows between, where there was barely
enough to see, it seemed bright by contrast. Off to the left a dark
shape stood sharp against the sky, a large, flat stone slanting out
of a hillside, cloaking the slope beneath in darkness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This way,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>He trotted toward the hill, glancing over his
shoulder for any sign of the men who were coming. There was nothing&mdash;yet. More than once he had to stop and wait while the others
stumbled after him. Egwene was crouched over Bela&rsquo;s neck, and the
mare was picking her way carefully over the uneven ground. Perrin
thought they both must be more tired than he had believed. <em>This
had better be a good hiding place. I don&rsquo;t think we can hunt for
another</em>.</p>

<p>At the base of the hill he studied the massive, flat
rock outlined against the sky, jutting out the slope almost at the
crest. There was an odd familiarity to the way the top of the huge
slab seemed to form irregular steps, three up and one down. He
climbed the short distance and felt across the stone, walking along
it. Despite the weathering of centuries he could still feel four
joined columns. He glanced up at the step-like top of the stone,
towering over his head like a huge lean-to. Fingers. <em>We&rsquo;ll
shelter in Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s hand. Maybe some of his justice is left
here</em>.</p>

<p>He motioned for Egwene to join him. She did not move,
so he slid back down to the base of the hill and told her what he
had found.</p>

<p>Egwene peered up the hill with her head pushed
forward. &ldquo;How can you see anything?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>Perrin opened his mouth, then shut it. He licked his
lips as he looked around, for the first time really aware of what
he was seeing. The sun was down. All the way down, now, and clouds
hid the full moon, but it still seemed like the deep purple fringes
of twilight to him. &ldquo;I felt the rock,&rdquo; he said finally. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what it has to be. They won&rsquo;t be able to pick us out against the
shadow of it even if they come this far.&rdquo; He took Bela&rsquo;s bridle to
lead her to the shelter of the hand. He could feel Egwene&rsquo;s eyes on
his back.</p>

<p>As he was helping her down from the saddle, the night
broke out in shouts back toward the pool. She laid a hand on
Perrin&rsquo;s arm, and he heard her unspoken question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The men saw Wind,&rdquo; he said reluctantly. It was
difficult to pick out the meaning of the wolves&rsquo; thoughts.
Something about fire. &ldquo;They have torches.&rdquo; He pressed her down at
the base of the fingers and crouched beside her. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re breaking
up into parties to search. So many of them, and the wolves are all
hurt.&rdquo; He tried to make his voice heartier. &ldquo;But Dapple and the
others should be able to keep out of their way, even injured, and
they don&rsquo;t expect us. People don&rsquo;t see what they don&rsquo;t expect.
They&rsquo;ll give up soon enough and make camp.&rdquo; Elyas was with the
wolves, and would not leave them while they were hunted. <em>So
many riders. So persistent. Why so persistent?</em></p>

<p>He saw Egwene nod, but in the dark she did not
realize it. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be all right, Perrin.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Light</em>, he thought wonderingly, she&rsquo;s
<em>trying to comfort</em> me.</p>

<p>The shouts went on and on. Small knots of torches
moved in the distance, flickering points of light in the
darkness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perrin,&rdquo; Egwene said softly, &ldquo;will you dance with me
at Sunday? If we&rsquo;re home by then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His shoulders shook. He made no sound, and he did not
know if he was laughing or crying. &ldquo;I will. I promise.&rdquo; Against his
will his hands tightened on the axe, reminding him that he still
held it. His voice dropped to a whisper. &ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; he said
again, and hoped.</p>

<p>Groups of torch-carrying men now rode through the
hills, bunches of ten or twelve. Perrin could not tell how many
groups there were. Sometimes three or four were in sight at once,
quartering back and forth. They continued to shout to one another,
and sometimes there were screams in the night, the screams of
horses, the screams of men.</p>

<p>He saw it all from more than one vantage. He crouched
on the hillside with Egwene, watching the torches move through the
darkness like fireflies, and in his mind he ran in the night with
Dapple, and Wind, and Hopper. The wolves had been too hurt by the
ravens to run far or fast, so they intended to drive the men out of
the darkness, drive them to the shelter of their fires. Men always
sought the safety of fires in the end, when wolves roamed the
night. Some of the mounted men led strings of horses without
riders; they whinnied and reared with wide, rolling eyes when the
gray shapes darted among them, screaming and pulling their lead
ropes from the hands of the men who held them, scattering in all
directions as fast as they could run. Horses with men on their
backs screamed, too, when gray shadows flashed out of the dark with
hamstringing fangs, and sometimes their riders screamed as well,
just before jaws tore out their throats. Elyas was out there, also,
more dimly sensed, stalking the night with his long knife, a
two-legged wolf with one sharp steel tooth. The shouts became
curses more often than not, but the searchers refused to give
up.</p>

<p>Abruptly Perrin realized that the men with torches
were following a pattern. Each time some of the parties came in
view, one of them, at least, was closer to the hillside where he
and Egwene were hiding. Elyas had said to hide, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>What
if we run? Maybe we could hide in the dark, if we keep moving.
Maybe. It has to be dark enough for that</em>.</p>

<p>He turned to Egwene, but as he did the decision was
taken away from him. Bunched torches, a dozen of them, came around
the base of the hill, wavering with the trot of the horses.
Lanceheads gleamed in the torchlight. He froze, holding his breath,
hands tightening on his axe haft.</p>

<p>The horsemen rode past the hill, but one of the men
shouted, and the torches swung back. He thought desperately,
seeking for a way to go. But as soon as they moved they would be
seen, if they had not already been, and once they were marked they
would have no chance, not even with the darkness to help.</p>

<p>The horsemen drew up at the foot of the hill, each
man holding a torch in one hand and a long lance in the other,
guiding his horse by the pressure of his knees. By the light of the
torches Perrin could see the white cloaks of the Children of the
Light. They held the torches high and leaned forward in their
saddles, peering up at the deep shadows under Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s
fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is something up there,&rdquo; one of them said. His
voice was too loud, as if he was afraid of what lay outside the
light of his torch. &ldquo;I told you somebody could hide in that. Isn&rsquo;t
that a horse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene laid a hand on Perrin&rsquo;s arm; her eyes were big
in the dark. Her silent question plain despite the shadow hiding
her features. What to do? Elyas and the wolves still hunted through
the night. The horses below shifted their feet nervously. <em>If we
run now, they&rsquo;ll chase us down</em>.</p>

<p>One of the Whitecloaks stepped his horse forward and
shouted up the hill. &ldquo;If you can understand human speech, come down
and surrender. You&rsquo;ll not be harmed if you walk in the Light. If
you don&rsquo;t surrender, you will all be killed. You have one minute.&rdquo;
The lances lowered, long steel heads bright with torchlight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perrin,&rdquo; Egwene whispered, &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t outrun them. If
we don&rsquo;t give up, they&rsquo;ll kill us. Perrin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elyas and the wolves were still free. Another
distant, bubbling scream marked a Whitecloak who had hunted Dapple
too closely. <em>If we run</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Egwene was looking at him,
waiting for him to tell her what to do. <em>If we run</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He
shook his head wearily and stood up like a man in a trance,
stumbling down the hill toward the Children of the Light. He heard
Egwene sigh and follow him, her feet dragging reluctantly. <em>Why
are the Whitecloaks so persistent, as if they hate wolves with a
passion? Why do they smell wrong?</em> He almost thought he could
smell the wrongness himself, when the wind gusted from the
riders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drop that axe,&rdquo; the leader barked.</p>

<p>Perrin stumbled toward him, wrinkling his nose to get
rid of the smell he thought he smelt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drop it, bumpkin!&rdquo; The leader&rsquo;s lance shifted toward
Perrin&rsquo;s chest.</p>

<p>For a moment he stared at the lancehead, enough sharp
steel to go completely through him, and abruptly he shouted, &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
It was not at the horseman he shouted.</p>

<p>Out of the night Hopper came, and Perrin was one with
the wolf. Hopper, the cub who had watched the eagles soar, and
wanted so badly to fly through the sky as the eagles did. The cub
who hopped and jumped and leaped until he could leap higher than
any other wolf, and who never lost the cub&rsquo;s yearning to soar
through the sky. Out of the night Hopper came and left the ground
in a leap, soaring like the eagles. The Whitecloaks had only a
moment to begin cursing before Hopper&rsquo;s jaws closed on the throat
of the man with his lance leveled at Perrin. The big wolf&rsquo;s
momentum carried them both off the other side of the horse. Perrin
felt the throat crushing, tasted the blood.</p>

<p>Hopper landed lightly, already apart from the man he
had killed. Blood matted his fur, his own blood and that of others.
A gash down his face crossed the empty socket where his left eye
had been. His good eye met Perrin&rsquo;s two for just an instant.
<em>Run, brother!</em> He whirled to leap again, to soar one last
time, and a lance pinned him to the earth. A second length of steel
thrust through his ribs, driving into the ground under him.
Kicking, he snapped at the shafts that held him. <em>To
soar</em>.</p>

<p>Pain filled Perrin, and he screamed, a wordless
scream that had something of a wolf&rsquo;s cry in it. Without thinking
he leaped forward, still screaming. All thought was gone. The
horsemen had bunched too much to be able to use their lances, and
the axe was a feather in his hands, one huge wolf&rsquo;s tooth of steel.
Something crashed into his head, and as he fell, he did not know if
it was Hopper or himself who died.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;soar like the eagles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mumbling, Perrin opened his eyes woozily. His head
hurt, and he could not remember why. Blinking against the light, he
looked around. Egwene was kneeling and watching him where he lay.
They were in a square tent as big as a medium-sized room in a
farmhouse, with a ground cloth for a floor. Oil lamps on tall
stands, one in each corner, gave a bright light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank the Light, Perrin,&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;I was
afraid they had killed you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instead of answering, he stared at the gray-haired
man seated in the lone chair in the tent. A dark-eyed,
grandfatherly face looked back at him, a face at odds in his mind
with the white-and-gold tabard the man wore, and the burnished
armor strapped over his pure-white undercoat. It seemed a kindly
face, bluff and dignified, and something about it fit the elegant
austerity of the tent&rsquo;s furnishings. A table and a folding bed, a
washstand with a plain white basin and pitcher, a single wooden
chest inlaid in simple geometric patterns. Where there was wood, it
was polished to a soft glow, and the metal gleamed, but not too
brightly, and nothing was showy. Everything in the tent had the
look of craftsmanship, but only someone who had watched the work of
craftsmen&mdash;like Master Luhhan, or Master Aydaer, the
cabinetmaker&mdash;would see it.</p>

<p>Frowning, the man stirred two small piles of objects
on the table with a blunt finger. Perrin recognized the contents of
his pockets in one of those piles, and his belt knife. The silver
coin Moiraine had given him toppled out, and the man pushed it back
thoughtfully. Pursing his lips, he left the piles and lifted
Perrin&rsquo;s axe from the table, hefting it. His attention came back to
the Emond&rsquo;s Fielders.</p>

<p>Perrin tried to get up. Sharp pain stabbing along his
arms and legs turned the movement into a flop. For the first time
he realized that he was tied, hand and foot. His eyes went to
Egwene. She shrugged ruefully, and twisted so that he could see her
back. Half a dozen lashings wrapped her wrists and ankles, the
cords making ridges in her flesh. A length of rope ran between the
bonds around ankles and wrists, short enough to stop her from
straightening to more than a crouch if she got to her feet.</p>

<p>Perrin stared. That they were tied was shock enough,
but they wore enough ropes to hold horses. <em>What do they think
we are?</em></p>

<p>The gray-haired man watched them, curious and
thoughtful, like Master al&rsquo;Vere puzzling out a problem. He held the
axe as if he had forgotten it.</p>

<p>The tent flap shifted aside, and a tall man stepped
into the tent. His face was long and gaunt, with eyes so deeply set
they seemed to look out from caves. There was no excess flesh on
him, no fat at all; his skin was pulled tight over the muscle and
bone beneath.</p>

<p>Perrin had a glimpse of night outside, and campfires,
and two white-cloaked guards at the entrance of the tent, then the
flap fell back into place. As soon as the newcomer was into the
tent, he stopped, standing as rigid as an iron rod, staring
straight ahead of him at the far wall of the tent. His
plate-and-mail armor gleamed like silver against his snowy cloak
and undercoat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord Captain.&rdquo; His voice was as hard as his
posture, and grating, but somehow flat, without expression.</p>

<p>The gray-haired man made a casual gesture. &ldquo;Be at
your ease, Child Byar. You have tallied our costs for this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;encounter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tall man moved his feet apart, but other than
that Perrin did not see anything ease about his stance. &ldquo;Nine men
dead, my Lord Captain, and twenty-three injured, seven seriously.
All can ride, though. Thirty horses had to be put down. They were
hamstrung!&rdquo; He emphasized that in his emotionless voice, as if what
had happened to the horses were worse than the deaths and injuries
to men. &ldquo;Many of the remounts are scattered. We may find some at
daybreak, my Lord Captain, but with wolves to send them on their
way, it will take days to gather them all. The men who were
supposed to be watching them have been assigned to night guard
until we reach Caemlyn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do not have days, Child Byar,&rdquo; the gray-haired
man said mildly. &ldquo;We ride at dawn. Nothing can change that. We must
be in Caemlyn in time, yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you command, my Lord Captain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gray-haired man glanced at Perrin and Egwene,
then away again. &ldquo;And what have we to show for it, aside from these
two younglings?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Byar drew a deep breath and hesitated. &ldquo;I have had
the wolf that was with this lot skinned, my Lord Captain. The hide
should make a fine rug for my Lord Captain&rsquo;s tent.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Hopper!</em> Not even realizing what he was
doing, Perrin growled and struggled against his bonds. The ropes
dug into his skin&mdash;his wrists became slippery with blood&mdash;but
they did not give.</p>

<p>For the first time Byar looked at the prisoners.
Egwene started back from him. His face was as expressionless as his
voice, but a cruel light burned in his sunken eyes, as surely as
flames burned in Ba&rsquo;alzamon&rsquo;s. Byar hated them as if they were
enemies of long years instead of people never seen before
tonight.</p>

<p>Perrin stared back defiantly. His mouth curled into a
tight smile at the thought of his teeth meeting in the man&rsquo;s
throat.</p>

<p>Abruptly his smile faded, and he shook himself.
<em>My teeth? I&rsquo;m a man, not a wolf! Light, there has to be an end
to this!</em> But he still met Byar&rsquo;s glare, hate for hate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not care about wolf-hide rugs, Child Byar.&rdquo; The
rebuke in the Lord Captain&rsquo;s voice was gentle, but Byar&rsquo;s back
snapped rigid again, his eyes locking to the wall of the tent. &ldquo;You
were reporting on what we achieved this night, no? If we achieved
anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would estimate the pack that attacked us at fifty
beasts or more, my Lord Captain. Of that, we killed at least
twenty, perhaps thirty. I did not consider it worth the risk of
losing more horses to have the carcasses brought in tonight. In the
morning I will have them gathered and burned, those that aren&rsquo;t
dragged off in the dark. Besides these two, there were at least a
dozen other men. I believe we disposed of four or five, but it is
unlikely we will find any bodies, given the Darkfriends&rsquo; propensity
for carrying away their dead to hide their losses. This seems to
have been a coordinated ambush, but that raises the question of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin&rsquo;s throat tightened as the gaunt man went on.
Elyas? Cautiously, reluctantly, he felt for Elyas, for the wolves&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and found nothing. It was as if he had never been able to feel
a wolf&rsquo;s mind. <em>Either they&rsquo;re dead, or they&rsquo;ve abandoned
you</em>. He wanted to laugh, a bitter laugh. At last he had what
he had been wishing for, but the price was high.</p>

<p>The gray-haired man did laugh, just then, a rich, wry
chuckle that made a red spot bloom on each of Byar&rsquo;s cheeks. &ldquo;So,
Child Byar, it is your considered estimate that we were attacked in
a planned ambush by upwards of fifty wolves and better than half a
score of Darkfriends? Yes? Perhaps when you&rsquo;ve seen a few more
actions&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my Lord Captain Bornhald&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would say six or eight wolves, Child Byar, and
perhaps no other humans than these two. You have the true zeal, but
no experience outside the cities. It is a different thing, bringing
the Light, when streets and houses are far distant. Wolves have a
way of seeming more than they are, in the night&mdash;and men,
also. Six or eight at most, I think.&rdquo; Byar&rsquo;s flush deepened slowly.
&ldquo;I also suspect they were here for the same reason we are: the only
easy water for at least a day in any direction. A much simpler
explanation than spies or traitors within the Children, and the
simplest explanation is usually the truest. You will learn, with
experience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Byar&rsquo;s face went deathly white as the grandfatherly
man spoke; by contrast, the two spots in his hollow cheeks deepened
from red to purple. He cut his eyes toward the two prisoners for an
instant.</p>

<p><em>He hates us even more, now</em>, Perrin thought,
<em>for hearing this. But why did he hate us in the first
place?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think of this?&rdquo; the Lord Captain said,
holding up Perrin&rsquo;s axe.</p>

<p>Byar looked a question at his commander and waited
for an answering nod before he broke his rigid stance to take the
weapon. He hefted the axe and gave a surprised grunt, then whirled
it in a tight arc above his head that barely missed the top of the
tent. He handled it as surely as if he had been born with an axe in
his hands. A look of grudging admiration flickered across his face,
but by the time he lowered the axe he was expressionless once
more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excellently balanced, my Lord Captain. Plainly made,
but by a very good weaponsmith, perhaps even a master.&rdquo; His eyes
burned darkly at the prisoners. &ldquo;Not a villager&rsquo;s weapon, my Lord
Captain. Nor a farmer&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; The gray-haired man turned toward Perrin and
Egwene with a weary, slightly chiding smile, a kindly grandfather
who knew his grandchildren had been up to some mischief. &ldquo;My name
is Geofram Bornhald,&rdquo; he told them. &ldquo;You are Perrin, I understand.
But you, young woman, what is your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin glowered at him, but Egwene shook her head.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, Perrin. I&rsquo;m Egwene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just Perrin, and just Egwene,&rdquo; Bornhald murmured.
&ldquo;But I suppose if you truly are Darkfriends, you wish to hide your
identities as much as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin heaved himself up to his knees; he could rise
no further because of the way he was bound. &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t
Darkfriends,&rdquo; he protested angrily.</p>

<p>The words were not completely out of his mouth before
Byar reached him. The man moved like a snake. He saw the handle of
his own axe swinging toward him and tried to duck, but the thick
haft caught him over the ear. Only the fact that he was moving away
from the blow kept his skull from being split. Even so, lights
flashed in his eyes. Breath left him as he struck the ground. His
head rung, and blood ran down his cheek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have no right,&rdquo; Egwene began, and screamed as
the axe handle whipped toward her. She threw herself aside, and the
blow whistled through empty air as she tumbled to the ground
cloth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will keep a civil tongue,&rdquo; Byar said, &ldquo;when
speaking to an Anointed of the Light, or you will have no tongue. &ldquo;
The worst of it was his voice still had no emotion at all. Cutting
out their tongues would give him no pleasure and no regret; it was
just something he would do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go easy, Child Byar.&rdquo; Bornhald looked at the
captives again. &ldquo;I expect you do not know much about the Anointed,
or about Lords Captain of the Children of the Light, do you? No, I
thought not. Well, for Child Byar&rsquo;s sake, at least, try not to
argue or shout, yes? I want no more than that you should walk in
the Light, and letting anger get the better of you won&rsquo;t help any
of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin looked up at the gaunt-faced man standing over
them. <em>For Child Byar&rsquo;s sake?</em> He noticed that the Lord
Captain did not tell Byar to leave them alone. Byar met his eyes
and smiled; the smile touched only his mouth, but the skin of his
face drew tighter, until it looked like a skull. Perrin
shivered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard of this thing of men running with
wolves,&rdquo; Bornhald said musingly, &ldquo;though I have not seen it before.
Men supposedly talking with wolves, and with other creatures of the
Dark One. A filthy business. It makes me fear the Last Battle is
indeed coming soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wolves aren&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; Perrin cut off as Byar&rsquo;s boot
drew back. Taking a deep breath, he went on in a milder tone. Byar
lowered his foot with a disappointed grimace. &ldquo;Wolves aren&rsquo;t
creatures of the Dark One. They hate the Dark One. At least, they
hate Trollocs, and Fades.&rdquo; He was surprised to see the gaunt-faced
man nod as if to himself.</p>

<p>Bornhald raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Warder,&rdquo; Egwene said. She scrunched away from
Byar&rsquo;s heated eyes. &ldquo;He said wolves hate Trollocs, and Trollocs are
afraid of wolves.&rdquo; Perrin was glad she had not mentioned Elyas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Warder,&rdquo; the gray-haired man sighed. &ldquo;A creature
of the Tar Valon witches. What else would that sort tell you, when
he is a Darkfriend himself, and a servant of Darkfriends? Do you
not know Trollocs have wolves&rsquo; muzzles and teeth, and wolves&rsquo;
fur?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin blinked, trying to clear his head. His brain
still felt like jellied pain, but there was something wrong here.
He could not get his thoughts straight enough to puzzle it out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not all of them,&rdquo; Egwene muttered. Perrin gave Byar
a wary look, but the gaunt man only watched her. &ldquo;Some of them have
horns, like rams or goats, or hawks&rsquo; beaks, or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;all
sorts of things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bornhald shook his head sadly. &ldquo;I give you every
chance, and you dig yourself deeper with every word.&rdquo; He held up
one finger. &ldquo;You run with wolves, creatures of the Dark One.&rdquo; A
second finger. &ldquo;You admit to being acquainted with a Warder,
another creature of the Dark One. I doubt he would have told you
what he did if it was only in passing.&rdquo; A third finger. &ldquo;You, boy,
carry a Tar Valon mark in your pocket. Most men outside Tar Valon
get rid of those as fast as they can. Unless they serve the Tar
Valon witches.&rdquo; A fourth. &ldquo;You carry a fighting man&rsquo;s weapon while
you dress like a farmboy. A skulker, then.&rdquo; The thumb rose. &ldquo;You
know Trollocs, and Myrddraal. This far south, only a few scholars
and those who have traveled in the Borderlands believe they are
anything but stories. Perhaps you have been to the Borderlands? If
so, tell me where? I have traveled a good deal in the Borderlands;
I know them well. No? Ah, well, then.&rdquo; He looked at his spread
hand, then dropped it hard on the table. The grandfatherly
expression said the grandchildren had been up to some very serious
mischief indeed. &ldquo;Why do you not tell me the truth of how you came
to be running in the night with wolves?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene opened her mouth, but Perrin saw the stubborn
set of her jaw and knew right away she was going to tell one of the
stories they had worked out. That would not do. Not now, not here.
His head ached, and he wished he had time to think it out, but
there was no time. Who could tell where this Bornhald had traveled,
with what lands and cities he was familiar? If he caught them in a
lie, there would be no going back to the truth. Bornhald would be
convinced they were Darkfriends, then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re from the Two Rivers,&rdquo; he said quickly.</p>

<p>Egwene stared at him openly before she caught
herself, but he pressed on with the truth&mdash;or a version of
it. The two of them had left the Two Rivers to see Caemlyn. On the
way they had heard of the ruins of a great city, but when they
found Shadar Logoth, there were Trollocs there. The two of them
managed to escape across the River Arinelle, but by that time they
were completely lost. Then they fell in with a man who offered to
guide them to Caemlyn. He had said his name was none of their
business, and he hardly seemed friendly, but they needed a guide.
The first either of them had seen of wolves had been after the
Children of the Light appeared. All they had been trying to do was
hide so they would not get eaten by wolves or killed by the men on
horses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;If we&rsquo;d known you were Children of the Light,&rdquo;
he finished, &ldquo;we&rsquo;d have gone to you for help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Byar snorted with disbelief. Perrin did not care
overmuch; if the Lord Captain was convinced, Byar could not harm
them. It was plain that Byar would stop breathing if Lord Captain
Bornhald told him to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no Warder in that,&rdquo; the gray-haired man
said after a moment.</p>

<p>Perrin&rsquo;s invention failed him; he knew he should have
taken time to think it out. Egwene leaped into the breach. &ldquo;We met
him in Baerlon. The city was crowded with men who had come down
from the mines after the winter, and we were put at the same table
in an inn. We only talked to him for the length of a meal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin breathed again. <em>Thank you,
Egwene</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give them back their belongings, Child Byar. Not the
weapons, of course.&rdquo; When Byar looked at him in surprise, Bornhald
added, &ldquo;Or are you one of those who have taken to looting the
unenlightened, Child Byar? It is a bad business, that, yes? No man
can be a thief and walk in the Light.&rdquo; Byar seemed to struggle with
disbelief at the suggestion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re letting us go?&rdquo; Egwene sounded
surprised. Perrin lifted his head to stare at the Lord Captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not, child,&rdquo; Bornhald said sadly. &ldquo;You may
be telling the truth about being from the Two Rivers, since you
know about Baerlon, and the mines. But Shadar Logoth&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? That
is a name very, very few know, most of them Darkfriends, and anyone
who knows enough to know the name, knows enough not to go there. I
suggest you think of a better story on the journey to Amador. You
will have time, since we must pause in Caemlyn. Preferably the
truth, child. There is freedom in truth and the Light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Byar forgot some of his diffidence toward the
gray-haired man. He spun from the prisoners, and there was an
outraged snap to his words. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t! It is not allowed!&rdquo;
Bornhald raised one eyebrow quizzically, and Byar pulled himself up
short, swallowing. &ldquo;Forgive me, my Lord Captain. I forgot myself,
and I humbly beg pardon and submit myself for penance, but as my
Lord Captain himself has pointed out, we must reach Caemlyn in
time, and with most of our remounts gone, we will be hard pressed
enough without carrying prisoners along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what would you suggest?&rdquo; Bornhald asked
calmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The penalty for Darkfriends is death.&rdquo; The flat
voice made it all the more jarring. He might have been suggesting
stepping on a bug. &ldquo;There is no truce with the Shadow. There is no
mercy for Darkfriends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zeal is to be applauded, Child Byar, but, as I must
often tell my son, Dain, overzealousness can be a grievous fault.
Remember that the Tenets also say, &lsquo;No man is so lost that he
cannot be brought to the Light.&rsquo; These two are young. They cannot
yet be deep in the Shadow. They can yet be led to the Light, if
they will only allow the Shadow to be lifted from their eyes. We
must give them that chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Perrin almost felt affection for the
grandfatherly man who stood between them and Byar. Then Bornhald
turned his grandfather&rsquo;s smile on Egwene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you refuse to come to the Light by the time we
reach Amador, I will be forced to turn you over to the Questioners,
and beside them Byar&rsquo;s zeal is but a candle beside the sun.&rdquo; The
gray-haired man sounded like a man who regretted what he must do,
but who had no intention of ever doing anything but his duty as he
saw it. &ldquo;Repent, renounce the Dark One, come to the Light, confess
your sins and tell what you know of this vileness with wolves, and
you will be spared that. You will walk free, in the Light.&rdquo; His
gaze centered on Perrin, and he sighed sadly. Ice filled Perrin&rsquo;s
spine. &ldquo;But you, just Perrin from the Two Rivers. You killed two of
the Children.&rdquo; He touched the axe that Byar still held. &ldquo;For you, I
fear, a gibbet waits in Amador.&rdquo;</p>
