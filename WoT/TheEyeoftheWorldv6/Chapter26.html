last unsteady note of what had been barely
recognizable as &ldquo;The Wind That Shakes the Willow&rdquo; faded mercifully
away, and Mat lowered Thom&rsquo;s gold-and-silver-chased flute. Rand
took his hands from his ears. A sailor coiling a line on the deck
nearby heaved a loud sigh of relief. For a moment the only sounds
were the water slapping against the hull, the rhythmic creak of the
oars, and now and again the hum of rigging strummed by the wind.
The wind blew dead on to the <em>Spray</em>&rsquo;s bow, and the useless
sails were furled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I should thank you,&rdquo; Thom Merrilin
muttered finally, &ldquo;for teaching me how true the old saying is.
Teach him how you will, a pig will never play the flute.&rdquo; The
sailor burst out laughing, and Mat raised the flute as if to throw

hard.&rdquo; He glanced at the sailor and lowered his voice. &ldquo;After all,
we aren&rsquo;t really trying to become gleemen. It&rsquo;s only something to
hide behind until we find Moiraine and the others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom tugged at an end of his mustache and seemed to
be studying the smooth, dark brown leather of the flute case on his
knees. &ldquo;What if you don&rsquo;t find them, boy? There&rsquo;s no
