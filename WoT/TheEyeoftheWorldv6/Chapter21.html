creeping across the River Arinelle found its way into
the hollow not far from the riverbank where Nynaeve sat with her
back against the trunk of a young oak, breathing the deep breath of
sleep. Her horse slept, too, head down and legs spraddled in the manner
of horses. The reins were wrapped around her wrist. As sunlight
fell on the horse&rsquo;s eyelids, the animal opened its eyes and raised

reason they had to have crossed, or tried to cross, in sight of
where she was. They could be anywhere ten miles upriver or down. <em>If
they&rsquo;re alive at all, after last night</em>.</p>

<p>Angry with herself for thinking of the possibility, she slid
back down into the hollow. Not e
