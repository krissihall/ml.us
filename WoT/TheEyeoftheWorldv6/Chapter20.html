they left the white stone building on their nervously
shifting horses, the icy wind came in gusts, moaning across the
rooftops, whipping cloaks like banners, driving thin clouds across
the thin sliver of the moon. With a quiet command to stay close,
Lan led off down the street. The horses danced and tugged at the
reins, eager to be away.</p>

<p>Rand looked up warily at the buildings they passed, looming now
in the night with their empty windows like eye sockets. Shadows
seemed to move. Occasionally there was a clatter&mdash;rubble toppled by
the wind. <em>At least the eyes are gone</em>. His relief was momentary. Why

<p>Thom and the Emond&rsquo;s Fielders made a cluster with him, all

thick as a man&rsquo;s arm now. Cloud whickered and tried to back further
away as Egwene and Thom and the others came up on him. Their
horses, too, tossed their heads and bridled against coming too near
the fog.</p>
