<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">I</span>nside,
the inn was every bit as busy as the sounds coming from
it had indicated and more. The party from Emond&rsquo;s Field followed
Master Fitch through the back door, soon weaving around and between
a constant stream of men and women in long aprons, platters of food
and trays of drink held high. The bearers murmured quick apologies
when they got in anyone&rsquo;s way, but they never slowed by a step. One
of the men took hurried orders from Master Fitch and disappeared at
a run.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The inn is near full, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; the innkeeper told Moiraine.
&ldquo;Almost to the rafters. Every inn in the town is the same. With the
winter we just had&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well, as soon as it cleared enough for
them to get down out of the mountains we were inundated&mdash;yes,
that&rsquo;s the word&mdash;inundated by men from the mines and
smelters, all telling the most horrible tales. Wolves, and worse.
The kind of tales men tell when they&rsquo;ve been cooped up all winter.
I can&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anyone left up there at all, we have that
many here. But never fear. Things may be a little crowded, but I&rsquo;ll
do my best by you and Master Andra. And your friends, too, of
course.&rdquo; He glanced curiously once or twice at Rand and the others;
except for Thom their clothes named them country folk, and Thom&rsquo;s
gleeman&rsquo;s cloak made him a strange traveling companion as well for
&ldquo;Mistress Alys&rdquo; and &ldquo;Master Andra&rdquo;. &ldquo;I will do my best, you may rest
assured.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stared at the bustle around them and tried to avoid being
stepped on, though none of the help really seemed to be in any
danger of that. He kept thinking of how Master al&rsquo;Vere and his wife
tended the Winespring Inn with sometimes a little assistance from
their daughters.</p>
