<h4><em>The Long Chase</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">N</span>ynaeve
gripped the reins of the three horses and
peered into the night as if she could somehow pierce the darkness
and find the Aes Sedai and the Warder. Skeletal trees surrounded
her, stark and black in the dim moonlight. The trees and the night
made an effective screen for whatever Moiraine and Lan were doing,
not that either of them had paused to let her know what that was. A
low &ldquo;Keep the horses quiet,&rdquo; from Lan, and they were gone, leaving
her standing like a stableboy. She glanced at the horses and sighed
with exasperation.</p>

<p>Mandarb blended into the night almost as well as his
master&rsquo;s cloak. The only reason the battle-trained stallion was
letting her get this close was because Lan had handed her the reins
himself. He seemed calm enough now, but she remembered all too well
the lips drawing back silently when she reached for his bridle
without waiting for Lan&rsquo;s approval. The silence had made the bared
teeth seem that much more dangerous. With a last wary look at the
stallion, she turned to peer in the direction the other two had
gone, idly stroking her own horse. She gave a startled jump when
Aldieb pushed a pale muzzle under her hand, but after a minute she
gave the white mare a pat, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No need to take it out on you, I suppose,&rdquo; she
whispered, &ldquo;just because your mistress is a cold-faced&mdash;&rdquo; She
strained at the darkness again. <em>What were they doing?</em></p>

<p>After leaving Whitebridge they had ridden through
villages that seemed unreal in their normality, ordinary market
villages that seemed to Nynaeve unconnected to a world that had
Fades and Trollocs and Aes Sedai. They had followed the Caemlyn
Road, until at last Moiraine sat forward in Aldieb&rsquo;s saddle,
peering eastward as if she could see the whole length of the great
highway, all the many miles to Caemlyn, and see, too, what waited
there.</p>

<p>Eventually the Aes Sedai let out a long breath and
settled back. &ldquo;The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills,&rdquo; she murmured,
&ldquo;but I cannot believe it weaves an end to hope. I must first take
care of that of which I can be certain. It will be as the Wheel
weaves.&rdquo; And she turned her mare north, off the road into the
forest. One of the boys was in that direction with the coin
Moiraine had given him. Lan followed.</p>

<p>Nynaeve gave a long last look at the Caemlyn Road.
Few people shared the roadway with them there, a couple of
high-wheeled carts and one empty wagon in the distance, a handful
of folk afoot with their belongings on their backs or piled on
pushcarts. Some of those were willing to admit they were on their
way to Caemlyn to see the false Dragon, but most denied it
vehemently, especially those who had come through Whitebridge. At
Whitebridge she had begun to believe Moiraine. Somewhat. More, at
any rate. And there was no comfort in that.</p>

<p>The Warder and the Aes Sedai were almost out of sight
through the trees before she started after them. She hurried to
catch up. Lan looked back at her frequently, and waved for her to
come on, but he kept at Moiraine&rsquo;s shoulder, and the Aes Sedai had
her eyes fixed ahead.</p>

<p>One evening after they left the road, the invisible
trail failed. Moiraine, the unflappable Moiraine, suddenly stood up
beside the small fire where the tea kettle was boiling, her eyes
widening. &ldquo;It is gone,&rdquo; she whispered at the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; Nynaeve could not finish the
question. <em>Light, I don&rsquo;t even know which one it is!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;He did not die,&rdquo; the Aes Sedai said slowly, &ldquo;but he
no longer has the token.&rdquo; She sat down, her voice level and her
hands steady as she took the kettle off the flames and tossed in a
handful of tea. &ldquo;In the morning we will keep on as we&rsquo;ve been
going. When I get close enough, I can find him without the
coin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the fire burned down to coals, Lan rolled himself
in his cloak and went to sleep. Nynaeve could not sleep. She
watched the Aes Sedai. Moiraine had her eyes closed, but she sat
upright, and Nynaeve knew she was awake.</p>

<p>Long after the last glow had faded from the coals,
Moiraine opened her eyes and looked at her. She could feel the Aes
Sedai&rsquo;s smile even in the dark. &ldquo;He has regained the coin, Wisdom.
All will be well.&rdquo; She lay down on her blankets with a sigh and
almost at once was breathing deep in slumber.</p>

<p>Nynaeve had a hard time joining her, tired as she
was. Her mind conjured up the worst no matter how she tried to stop
it. <em>All will be well</em>. After Whitebridge, she could no
longer make herself believe that so easily.</p>

<p>Abruptly Nynaeve was jerked from memory back to the
night; there really was a hand on her arm. Stifling the cry that
rose in her throat, she fumbled for the knife at her belt, her hand
closing on the hilt before she realized that the hand was
Lan&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The Warder&rsquo;s hood was thrown back, but his
chameleon-like cloak blended so well with the night that the dim
blur of his face seemed to hang suspended in the night. The hand on
her arm appeared to come out of thin air.</p>

<p>She drew a shuddering breath. She expected him to
comment on how easily he had come on her unaware, but instead he
turned to dig into his saddlebags. &ldquo;You are needed,&rdquo; he said, and
knelt to fasten hobbles on the horses.</p>

<p>As soon as the horses were secured, he straightened,
grasped her hand, and headed off into the night again. His dark
hair fit into the night almost as well as his cloak, and he made
even less noise than she did. Grudgingly she had to admit that she
could never have followed him through the darkness without his grip
as a guide. She was not certain she could pull loose if he did not
want to release her, anyway; he had very strong hands.</p>

<p>As they came up on a small rise, barely enough to be
called a hill, he sank to one knee, pulling her down beside him. It
took her a moment to see that Moiraine was there, too. Unmoving,
the Aes Sedai could have passed for a shadow in her dark cloak. Lan
gestured down the hillside to a large clearing in the trees.</p>

<p>Nynaeve frowned in the dim moonlight, then suddenly
smiled in understanding. Those pale blurs were tents in regular
rows, a darkened encampment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whitecloaks,&rdquo; Lan whispered, &ldquo;two hundred of them,
maybe more. There&rsquo;s good water down there. And the lad we&rsquo;re
after.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the camp?&rdquo; She felt, more than saw, Lan nod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the middle of it. Moiraine can point right to
him. I went close enough to see he&rsquo;s under guard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A prisoner?&rdquo; Nynaeve said. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. The Children should not be interested
in a village boy, not unless there was something to make them
suspicious. The Light knows it doesn&rsquo;t take much to make
Whitecloaks suspicious, but it still worries me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you going to free him?&rdquo; It was not until he
glanced at her that she realized how much assurance there had been
in her that he could march into the middle of two hundred men and
come back with the boy. <em>Well, he</em> is <em>a Warder</em>.
Some <em>of the stories must be true</em>.</p>

<p>She wondered if he was laughing at her, but his voice
was flat and businesslike. &ldquo;I can bring him out, but he&rsquo;ll likely
be in no shape for stealth. If we&rsquo;re seen, we may find two hundred
Whitecloaks on our heels, and us riding double. Unless they are too
busy to chase us. Are you willing to take a chance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To help an Emond&rsquo;s Fielder? Of course! What kind of
chance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pointed into the darkness again, beyond the tents.
This time she could make out nothing but shadows. &ldquo;Their
horse-lines. If the picket ropes are cut, not all the way through,
but enough so they&rsquo;ll break when Moiraine creates a diversion, the
Whitecloaks will be too busy chasing their own horses to come after
us. There are two guards on that side of the camp, beyond the
picket-lines, but if you are half as good as I think you are,
they&rsquo;ll never see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She swallowed hard. Stalking rabbits was one thing;
guards, though, with spears and swords&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>So he thinks I&rsquo;m
good, does he?</em> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan nodded again, as if he had expected no less. &ldquo;One
other thing. There are wolves about, tonight. I saw two, and if I
saw that many, there are probably more.&rdquo; He paused, and though his
voice did not change she had the feeling he was puzzled. &ldquo;It was
almost as if they wanted me to see them. Anyway, they shouldn&rsquo;t
bother you. Wolves usually stay away from people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have known that,&rdquo; she said sweetly. &ldquo;I
only grew up around shepherds.&rdquo; He grunted, and she smiled into the
darkness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do it now, then,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Her smile faded as she peered down at the camp full
of armed men. Two hundred men with spears and swords and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Before she could reconsider, she eased her knife in its sheath and
started to slip away. Moiraine caught her arm in a grip almost as
strong as Lan&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take care,&rdquo; the Aes Sedai said softly. &ldquo;Once you cut
the ropes, return as quickly as you can. You are a part of the
Pattern, too, and I would not risk you, any more than any of the
others, if the whole world was not at risk in these days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve rubbed her arm surreptitiously when Moiraine
released it. She was not about to let the Aes Sedai know the grip
had hurt. But Moiraine turned back to watching the camp below as
soon as she let go. And the Warder was gone, Nynaeve realized with
a start. She had not heard him leave. <em>Light blind the bloody
man!</em> Quickly she tied her skirts up to give her legs freedom,
and hurried into the night.</p>

<p>After that first rush, with fallen branches cracking
under her feet, she slowed down, glad there was no one there to see
her blush. The idea was to be quiet, and she was not in any kind of
competition with the Warder. <em>Oh, no?</em></p>

<p>She shook off the thought and concentrated on making
her way through the dark woods. It was not hard in and of itself;
the faint light of the waning moon was more than enough for anyone
who had been taught by her father, and the ground had a slow, easy
roll. But the trees, bare and stark against the night sky,
constantly reminded her that this was no childhood game, and the
keening wind sounded all too much like Trolloc horns. Now that she
was alone in the darkness, she remembered that the wolves that
usually ran away from people had been behaving differently in the
Two Rivers this winter.</p>

<p>Relief flooded through her like warmth when she
finally caught the smell of horses. Almost holding her breath, she
got down on her stomach and crawled upwind, toward the smell.</p>

<p>She was nearly on the guards before she saw them,
marching toward her out of the night, white cloaks flapping in the
wind and almost shining in the moonlight. They might as well have
carried torches; torchlight could not have made them much more
visible. She froze, trying to make herself a part of the ground.
Nearly in front of her, not ten paces away, they marched to a halt
with a stomp of feet, facing each other, spears shouldered. Just
beyond them she could make out shadows that had to be the horses.
The stable smell, horse and manure, was strong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All is well with the night,&rdquo; one white-cloaked shape
announced. &ldquo;The Light illumine us, and protect us from the
Shadow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All is well with the night,&rdquo; the other replied. &ldquo;The
Light illumine us, and protect us from the Shadow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that they turned and marched off into the
darkness again.</p>

<p>Nynaeve waited, counting to herself while they made
their circuit twice. Each time they took exactly the same count,
and each time they rigidly repeated the same formula, not a word
more or less. Neither so much as glanced to one side; they stared
straight ahead as they marched up, then marched away. She wondered
if they would have noticed her even if she had been standing
up.</p>

<p>Before the night swallowed the pale swirls of their
cloaks a third time, she was already on her feet, running in a
crouch toward the horses. As she came close, she slowed so as not
to startle the animals. The Whitecloak guards might not see what
was not shoved under their noses, but they would certainly
investigate if the horses suddenly began whickering.</p>

<p>The horses along the picket-lines&mdash;there was
more than one row&mdash;were barely realized masses in the
darkness, heads down. Occasionally one snorted or stamped a foot in
its sleep. In the dim moonlight she was nearly on the endpost of
the picket-line before she saw it. She reached for the picket-line,
and froze when the nearest horse raised its head and looked at her.
Its single lead-rein was tied in a big loop around the thumb-thick
line that ended at the post. <em>One whinny</em>. Her heart tried
to pound its way out of her chest, sounding loud enough to bring
the guards.</p>

<p>Never taking her eyes off the horse, she sliced at
the picket-rope, feeling in front of her blade to see how far she
had cut. The horse tossed its head, and her breath went cold.
<em>Just one whinny</em>.</p>

<p>Only a few thin strands of hemp remained whole under
her fingers. Slowly she headed toward the next line, watching the
horse until she could no longer see if it was looking at her or
not, then drew a ragged breath. If they were all like that, she did
not think she would last.</p>

<p>At the next picket-rope, though, and the next, and
the next, the horses remained asleep, even when she cut her thumb
and bit off a yelp. Sucking the cut, she looked warily back the way
she had come. Upwind as she was, she could no longer hear the
guards make their exchange, but they might have heard her if they
were in the right place. If they were coming to see what the noise
had been, the wind would keep her from hearing them until they were
right on top of her. <em>Time to go. With four horses out of five
running loose, they won&rsquo;t be chasing anyone</em>.</p>

<p>But she did not move. She could imagine Lan&rsquo;s eyes
when he heard what she had done. There would be no accusation in
them; her reasoning was sound, and he would not expect any more of
her. She was a Wisdom, not a bloody great invincible Warder who
could make himself all but invisible. Jaw set, she moved to the
last picket-line. The first horse on it was Bela.</p>

<p>There was no mistaking that squat, shaggy shape; for
there to be another horse like that, here and now, was too big a
coincidence. Suddenly she was so glad that she had not left off
this last line that she was shaking. Her arms and legs trembled so
that she was afraid to touch the picket-rope, but her mind was as
clear as the Winespring Water. Whichever of the boys was in the
camp, Egwene was there, too. And if they left riding double, some
of the Children would catch them no matter how well the horses were
scattered, and some of them would die. She was as certain as if she
were listening to the wind. That stuck a spike of fear into her
belly, fear of <em>how</em> she was certain. This had nothing to do
with weather or crops or sickness. <em>Why did Moiraine tell me I
can use the Power? Why couldn&rsquo;t she leave me alone?</em></p>

<p>Strangely, the fear stilled her trembling. With hands
as steady as if she were grinding herbs in her own house she slit
the picket-rope as she had the others. Thrusting the dagger back
into its sheath, she untied Bela&rsquo;s lead-rein. The shaggy mare woke
with a start, tossing her head, but Nynaeve stroked her nose and
spoke comforting words softly in her ear. Bela gave a low snort and
seemed content.</p>

<p>Other horses along that line were awake, too, and
looking at her. Remembering Mandarb, she reached hesitantly to the
next lead-rein, but that horse gave no objection to a strange hand.
Indeed, it seemed to want some of the muzzle-stroking that Bela had
received. She gripped Bela&rsquo;s rein tightly and wrapped the other
around her other wrist, all the while watching the camp nervously.
The pale tents were only thirty yards off, and she could see men
moving among them. If they noticed the horses stirring and came to
see what caused it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Desperately she wished for Moiraine not to wait on
her return. Whatever the Aes Sedai was going to do, let her do it
now. <em>Light, make her do it now, before</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Abruptly lightning shattered the night overhead, for
a moment obliterating darkness. Thunder smote her ears, so hard she
thought her knees would buckle, as a jagged trident stabbed the
ground just beyond the horses, splashing dirt and rocks like a
fountain. The crash of riven earth fought the thunderstroke. The
horses went mad, screaming and rearing; the picket-ropes snapped
like thread where she had cut them. Another lightning bolt sliced
down before the image of the first faded.</p>

<p>Nynaeve was too busy to exult. At the first clash
Bela jerked one way while the other horse reared away in the
opposite direction. She thought her arms were being pulled out of
their sockets. For an endless minute she hung suspended between the
horses, her feet off the ground, her scream flattened by the second
crash. Again the lightning struck, and again, and again, in one
continuous, raging roar from the heavens. Balked in the way they
wanted to go, the horses surged back, letting her drop. She wanted
to crouch on the ground and soothe her tortured shoulders, but
there was no time. Bela and the other horse buffeted her, eyes
rolling wildly till only whites showed, threatening to knock her
down and trample her. Somehow she made her arms lift, clutched her
hands in Bela&rsquo;s mane, pulled herself onto the heaving mare&rsquo;s back.
The other rein was still around her wrist, pulled tight into the
flesh.</p>

<p>Her jaw dropped as a long, gray shadow snarled past,
seeming to ignore her and the horses with her, but teeth snapping
at the crazed animals now darting in every direction. A second
shadow of death followed close behind. Nynaeve wanted to scream
again, but nothing came out. <em>Wolves! Light help us! What is
Moiraine doing?</em></p>

<p>The heels she dug into Bela&rsquo;s sides were not needed.
The mare ran, and the other was more than happy to follow.
Anywhere, so long as they could run, so long as they could escape
the fire from the sky that killed the night.</p>
