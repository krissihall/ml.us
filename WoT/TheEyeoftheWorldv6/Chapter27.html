fretted over the days spent with the
Tuatha&rsquo;an, traveling south and east in a leisurely fashion. The
Traveling People saw no need to hurry; they never did. The colorful
wagons did not roll out of a morning until the sun was well above
the horizon, and they stopped as early as midafternoon if they came
across a congenial spot. The dogs trotted easily alongside the
wagons, and often the children did, too. They had no difficulty in
keeping up. Any suggestion that they might go further, or more
quickly, was met with laughter, or perhaps, &ldquo;Ah, but would you make
the poor horses work so hard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was surprised that Elyas did not share his
feelings. Elyas would not ride on the wagons, he preferred to walk,
sometimes loping along at the head of the column&mdash;but he
never suggested leaving, or pressing on ahead.</p>

<p>The strange bearded man in his strange skin clothes
was so different from the gentle Tuatha&rsquo;an that he stood out
wherever he went among the wagons. Even from across the camp there
was no mistaking Elyas for one of the People, and not just because

on their feet. There was no danger in their grace, only delight.
Their children darted about filled with the pure zest of moving, of
course, but among the Tuatha&rsquo;an, graybeards and grandmothers, too,
still stepped lightly, their walk a stately dance no less exuberant
for its dignity. All the People seemed on the point of dancing,
even when standing still, even during the rare times when there was
no music in the camp. Fiddles and flutes, dulcimers and zithers and
drums
