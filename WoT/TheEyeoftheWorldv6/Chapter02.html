Rand and Mat carried the first barrels through the common
room, Master al&rsquo;Vere was already filling a pair of mugs with his
best brown ale, his own make, from one of the casks cracked against
one wall. Scratch, the inn&rsquo;s yellow cat, crouched atop it with his
eyes closed and his tail wrapped around his feet. Tam stood in
front of the big fireplace of river rock, thumbing a long-stemmed
pipe full of tabac from a polished canister the innkeeper always
kept on the plain stone mantel. The fireplace stretched half the
length of the big, square room, with a lintel as high as a man&rsquo;s
shoulder, and the crackling blaze on the hearth vanquished the
chill outside.</p>

<p>At that time of the busy day before Festival, Rand expected to
find the common room empty except for Bran and his father and the
cat, but four more members of the Village Council, including Cenn,
sat in high-backed chairs in front of the fire, mugs in hand and
blue-gray pipesmoke wreathing their heads. For once none of the
stones boards were in use, and all of Bran&rsquo;s books stood idle on
the shelf opposite the fireplace. The men did not even talk,
peering silently into their ale or tapping pipestems against their
teeth in impatience, as they waited for Tam and Bran to join
them.</p>

<p>Worry was not uncommon for the Village Council these days, not
in Emond&rsquo;s Field, and likely not in Watch Hill, or Deven Ride. Or
even Taren Ferry, though who knew what Taren Ferry folk really
thought about anything?</p>

<p>Only two of the men before the fire, Haral Luhhan, the
blacksmith, and Jon Thane, the miller, so much as glanced at the
boys as they entered. Master Luhhan, though, made it more than a
glance. The blacksmith&rsquo;s arms were as big as most men&rsquo;s legs, roped
with heavy muscle, and he still wore his long leather apron as if
he had hurried to the meeting straight from the forge. His frown
took them both in, then he straightened around in his chair
deliberately, turning his attention back to an over-studious
tamping of his pipe with a thick thumb.</p>

<p>Curious, Rand slowed, then barely bit back a yelp as Mat kicked
his ankle. His friend nodded insistently toward the doorway at the
back of the common room and hurried on without waiting. Limping
slightly, Rand followed less quickly.</p>

<p>What was that about?&rdquo; he demanded as soon as he was in the hall
that to the kitchen. &ldquo;You almost broke my&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s old Luhhan,&rdquo; Mat said, peering past Rand&rsquo;s shoulder into
the common room. &ldquo;I think he suspects I was the one who&mdash;&rdquo; He
cut off abruptly as Mistress al&rsquo;Vere bustled out of the kitchen,
the aroma of fresh-baked bread wafting ahead of her.</p>

<p>The tray in her hands carried some of the crusty loaves for
which she was famous around Emond&rsquo;s Field, as well as plates of
pickles and cheese. The food reminded Rand abruptly that he had
eaten only an end of bread before leaving the farm that morning.
His stomach gave an embarrassing rumble.</p>

<p>A slender woman, with her thick braid of graying hair pulled
over one shoulder, Mistress al&rsquo;Vere smiled in a motherly fashion
that took in both of them. &ldquo;There is more of this in the kitchen,
if you two are hungry, and I never knew boys your age who weren&rsquo;t.
Or any other age, for that matter. If you prefer, I&rsquo;m baking
honeycakes this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was one of the few married women in the area who never tried
to play matchmaker with Tam. Toward Rand her motherliness extended
to warm smiles and a quick snack whenever he came by the inn, but
she did as much for every young man in the area. If she
occasionally looked at him as if she wanted to do more, at least
she took it no further than looks, for that he was deeply
grateful.</p>

<p>Without waiting for a reply she swept on into the common room.
Immediately there was the sound of chairs scraping on the floor as
the men got to their feet, and exclaimings over the smell of the
bread. She was easily the best cook in Emond&rsquo;s Field, and not a man
for miles around but eagerly leaped at a chance to put his feet
under her table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Honeycakes,&rdquo; Mat said, smacking his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After,&rdquo; Rand told him firmly, &ldquo;or we&rsquo;ll never get done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A lamp hung over the cellar stairs, just beside the kitchen
door, and another made a bright pool in the stone-walled room
beneath the inn, banishing all but a little dimness in the furthest
corners. Wooden racks along the walls and across the floor held
casks of brandy and cider, and larger barrels of ale and wine, some
with taps driven in. Many of the wine barrels were marked with
chalk in Bran al&rsquo;Vere&rsquo;s hand, giving the year they had been bought,
what peddler had brought them, and in which city they had been
made, but all of the ale and brandy was the make of Two Rivers
farmers or of Bran himself. Peddlers, and even merchants, sometimes
brought brandy or ale from outside, but it was never as good and
cost the earth, besides, and nobody ever drank it more than
once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Rand said, as they set their casks in the racks, &ldquo;what
did you do that you have to avoid Master Luhhan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat shrugged. &ldquo;Nothing, really. I told Adan al&rsquo;Caar and some of
his snot-nosed friends&mdash;Ewin Finngar and Dag Coplin&mdash;that some
farmers had seen ghost hounds, breathing fire and running through
the woods. They ate it up like clotted cream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Master Luhhan is mad at you for that?&rdquo; Rand said
doubtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not exactly.&rdquo; Mat paused, then shook his head. &ldquo;You see, I
covered two of his dogs with flour, so they were all white. Then I
let them loose near Dag&rsquo;s house. How was I to know they&rsquo;d run
straight home? It really isn&rsquo;t my fault. If Mistress Luhhan hadn&rsquo;t
left the door open they couldn&rsquo;t have gotten inside. It isn&rsquo;t like
I intended to get flour all over her house.&rdquo; He gave a bark of
laughter. &ldquo;I hear she chased old Luhhan and the dogs, all three,
out of the house with a broom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand winced and laughed at the same time. &ldquo;If I were you, I&rsquo;d
worry more about Alsbet Luhhan than about the blacksmith. She&rsquo;s
almost as strong, and her temper is a lot worse. No matter, though.
If you walk fast, maybe he won&rsquo;t notice you.&rdquo; Mat&rsquo;s expression said
he did not think Rand was funny.</p>

<p>When they went back through the common room, though, there was
no need for Mat to hurry. The six men had their chairs in a tight
knot before the fireplace. With his back to the fire, Tam was
speaking in a low voice, and the others were leaning forward to
listen, so intent on his words they would likely not have noticed
if a flock of sheep had been driven through. Rand wanted to move
closer, to hear what they were talking about, but Mat plucked at
his sleeve and gave him an agonized look. With a sigh he followed
Mat out to the cart.</p>

<p>On their return to the hallway they found a tray by the top of
the steps, and hot honeycakes filling the hall with their sweet
aroma. There were two mugs, as well, and a pitcher of steaming
mulled cider. Despite his own admonition about waiting until later
Rand found himself making the last two trips between cart and
cellar while trying to juggle a cask and a piping honeycake.</p>

<p>Setting his final cask in the racks, he wiped crumbs from his
mouth while Mat was unburdening himself, then said, &ldquo;Now for the
glee&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Feet clattered on the stairs, and Ewin Finngar half fell into
the cellar in his haste, his pudgy face shining with eagerness to
impart his news. &ldquo;There are strangers in the village.&rdquo; He caught
his breath and gave Mat a wry look. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen any ghost
hounds, but I hear somebody floured Master Luhhan&rsquo;s dogs. I hear
Mistress Luhhan has ideas who to look for, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The years separating Rand and Mat from Ewin, only fourteen, were
usually more than enough for them to give short shrift to anything
he had to say. This time they exchanged one startled glance, then
both were talking at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the village?&rdquo; Rand asked. &ldquo;Not in the woods?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Right on top of him Mat added, &ldquo;Was his cloak black? Could you
see his face?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ewin looked uncertainly from one of them to the
other, then spoke quickly when Mat took a threatening step. &ldquo;Of
course I could see his face. And his cloak is green. Or maybe gray.
It changes. It seems to fade into wherever he&rsquo;s standing. Sometimes
you don&rsquo;t see him even when you look right at him, not unless he
moves. And hers is blue, like the sky, and ten times fancier than
any feastday clothes I ever saw. She&rsquo;s ten times prettier than
anybody I ever saw, too. She&rsquo;s a high-born lady, like in the
stories. She must be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her?&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;Who are you talking about?&rdquo; He stared at Mat,
who had put both hands on top of his head and squeezed his eyes
shut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re the ones I meant to tell you about,&rdquo; Mat muttered,
&ldquo;before you got me off onto&mdash;&rdquo; He cut off, opening his eyes
for a sharp glance at Ewin. &ldquo;They arrived last evening,&rdquo; Mat went
on after a moment, &ldquo;and took rooms here at the inn. I saw them ride
in. Their horses, Rand. I never saw horses so tall, or so sleek.
They look like they could run forever. I think he works for
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In service,&rdquo; Ewin broke in. &ldquo;They call it being in service, in
the stories.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat continued as if Ewin had not spoken. &ldquo;Anyway, he defers to
her, does what she says. Only he isn&rsquo;t like a hired man. A soldier,
maybe. The way he wears his sword, it&rsquo;s part of him, like his hand
or his foot. He makes the merchants&rsquo; guards look like cur dogs. And
her, Rand. I never even imagined anyone like her. She&rsquo;s out of a
gleeman&rsquo;s story. She&rsquo;s like&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;like&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He paused to give
Ewin a sour look. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;like a high-born lady,&rdquo; he finished with
a sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But who are they?&rdquo; Rand asked. Except for merchants, once a
year to buy tabac and wool, and the peddlers, outsiders never came
into the Two Rivers, or as good as never. Maybe at Taren Ferry, but
not this far south. Most of the merchants and peddlers had been
coming for years, too, so they did not really count as strangers.
Just outsiders. It was a good five years since the last time a real
stranger appeared in Emond&rsquo;s Field, and he had been trying to hide
from some sort of trouble up in Baerlon that nobody in the village
understood. He had not stayed long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do they want?&rdquo; Mat exclaimed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what they
want. Strangers, Rand, and strangers like you never even dreamed
of. Think of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand opened his mouth, then closed it without speaking. The
black cloaked rider had him as nervous as a cat in a dog run. It
just seemed like an awful coincidence, three strangers around the
village at the same time. Three if this fellow&rsquo;s cloak that changed
colors never changed to black.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her name is Moiraine,&rdquo; Ewin said into the momentary silence. &ldquo;I
heard him say it. Moiraine, he called her. The Lady Moiraine. His
name is Lan. The Wisdom may not like her, but I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What makes you think Nynaeve dislikes her?&rdquo; Rand said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She asked the Wisdom for directions this morning,&rdquo; Ewin said,
&ldquo;and called her &lsquo;child.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; Rand and Mat both whistled softly through
their teeth, and Ewin tripped over his tongue in his haste to
explain. &ldquo;The Lady Moiraine didn&rsquo;t know she was the Wisdom. She
apologized when she found out. She did. And asked some questions
about herbs, and about who is who around Emond&rsquo;s Field, just as
respectfully as any woman in the village&mdash;more so than some. She&rsquo;s
always asking questions, about how old people are, and how long
they&rsquo;ve lived where they live, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;oh, I don&rsquo;t know what all.
Anyway, Nynaeve answered like she&rsquo;d bitten a green sweetberry.
Then, when the Lady Moiraine walked away, Nynaeve stared after her
like, like&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well, it wasn&rsquo;t friendly, I can tell you
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;You know Nynaeve&rsquo;s temper. When Cenn
Buie called her a child last year, she thumped him on the head with
her stick, and he&rsquo;s on the Village Council, and old enough to be
her grandfather, besides. She flares up at anything, and never
stays angry past turning around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too long for me,&rdquo; Ewin muttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care who Nynaeve thumps&rdquo;, Mat chortled, &ldquo;so long as it
isn&rsquo;t me. This is going to be the best Bel Tine ever. A gleeman, a
lady&mdash;who could ask for more? Who needs fireworks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A gleeman?&rdquo; Ewin said, his voice rising sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, Rand,&rdquo; Mat went on, ignoring the younger boy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
done here. You have to see this fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He bounded up the stairs, with Ewin scrambling behind him
calling, &ldquo;Is there really a gleeman, Mat? This isn&rsquo;t like the ghost
hounds, is it? Or the frogs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand paused long enough to turn down the lamp, then hurried
after them.</p>

<p>In the common room Rowan Hurn and Samel Crawe had joined the
others in front of the fire, so that the entire Village Council was
there. Bran al&rsquo;Vere spoke now, his normally bluff voice pitched so
low that only a rumbling murmur traveled beyond the close-gathered
chairs. The Mayor emphasized his words by capping a thick
forefinger into the palm of his hand, and eyed each man in turn.
They all nodded in agreement with whatever he was saying, though
Cenn more reluctantly than the rest.</p>

<p>The way the men all but huddled together spoke more plainly than
a painted sign. Whatever they were talking about, it was for the
Village Council alone, at least for now. They would not appreciate
Rand trying to listen in. Reluctantly he pulled himself away. There
was still the gleeman. And these strangers.</p>

<p>Outside, Bela and the cart were gone, taken away by Hu or Tad,
the stablemen. Mat and Ewin stood glaring at one another a few
paces from the front door of the inn, their cloaks whipping in the
wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the last time,&rdquo; Mat barked, &ldquo;I am <em>not</em> playing a trick on
you. There <em>is</em> a gleeman. Now go away. Rand, will you tell this
woolhead I am telling the truth so he&rsquo;ll leave me alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pulling his cloak together, Rand stepped forward to support Mat,
but words died as the hairs stirred on the back of his neck. He was
being watched again. It was far from the feeling the hooded rider
had given him, but neither was it pleasant, especially so soon
after that encounter.</p>

<p>A quick look about the Green showed him only what he had seen
before&mdash;children playing, people preparing for Festival, and no one
more than glancing in his direction. The Spring Pole stood alone,
now, waiting. Bustle and childish shouts filled the side streets.
All was as it should be. Except that he was being watched.</p>

<p>Then something led him to turn around, to raise his eyes. On the
edge of the inn&rsquo;s tile roof perched a large raven, swaying a little
in the gusting wind from the mountains. Its head was cocked to one
side, and one beady, black eye was focused&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;on him, he
thought. He swallowed, and suddenly anger flickered in him, hot and
sharp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Filthy carrion eater,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am tired of being stared at,&rdquo; Mat growled, and Rand realized
his friend had stepped up beside him and was frowning at the raven,
too.</p>

<p>They exchanged a glance, then as one their hands darted for
rocks.</p>

<p>The two stones flew true&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and the raven stepped aside;
the stones whistled through the space where it had been. Fluffing
its wings once, it cocked its head again, fixing them with a dead
black eye, unafraid, giving no sign that anything had happened.</p>

<p>Rand stared at the bird in consternation. &ldquo;Did you ever see a
raven do that?&rdquo; he asked quietly.</p>

<p>Mat shook his head without looking away from the raven. &ldquo;Never.
Nor any other bird, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A vile bird,&rdquo; came a woman&rsquo;s voice from behind them, melodious
despite echoes of distaste, &ldquo;to be mistrusted in the best of
times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a shrill cry the raven launched itself into the air so
violently that two black feathers drifted down from the roof&rsquo;s
edge.</p>

<p>Startled, Rand and Mat twisted to follow the bird&rsquo;s swift
flight, over the Green and toward the cloud-tipped Mountains of
Mist, tall beyond the Westwood, until it dwindled to a speck in the
west, then vanished from view.</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s gaze fell to the woman who had spoken. She, too, had been
watching the flight of the raven, but now she turned back, and her
eyes met his. He could only stare. This had to be the Lady
Moiraine, and she was everything that Mat and Ewin had said,
everything and more.</p>

<p>When he had heard she called Nynaeve child, he had pictured her
as old, but she was not. At least, he could not put any age to her
at all. At first he thought she was as young as Nynaeve, but the
longer he looked the more he thought she was older than that. There
was a maturity about her large, dark eyes, a hint of knowing that
no one could have gotten young. For an instant he thought those
eyes were deep pools about to swallow him up. It was plain why Mat
and Ewin named her a lady from a gleeman&rsquo;s tale, too. She held
herself with a grace and air of command that made him feel awkward
and stumble-footed. She was barely tall enough to come up to his
chest, but her presence was such that her height seemed the proper
one, and he felt ungainly in his tallness.</p>

<p>Altogether she was like no one he had ever seen before. The wide
hood of her cloak framed her face and dark hair, hanging in soft
ringlets. He had never seen a grown woman with her hair unbraided;
every girl in the Two Rivers waited eagerly for the Women&rsquo;s Circle
of her village to say she was old enough to wear a braid. Her
clothes were just as strange. Her cloak was sky-blue velvet, with
thick silver embroidery, leaves and vines and flowers, all along
the edges. Her dress gleamed faintly as she moved, a darker blue
than the cloak, and slashed with cream. A necklace of heavy gold
links hung around her neck, while another gold chain, delicate and
fastened in her hair, supported a small, sparkling blue stone in
the middle of her forehead. A wide belt of woven gold encircled her
waist, and on the second finger of her left hand was a gold ring in
the shape of a serpent biting its own tail. He had certainly never
seen a ring like that, though he recognized the Great Serpent, an
even older symbol for eternity than the Wheel of Time.</p>

<p>Fancier than any feastday clothes, Ewin had said, and he was
right. No one ever dressed like that in the Two Rivers. Not
ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mistress&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Lady Moiraine,&rdquo; Rand
said. His face grew hot at his tongue&rsquo;s fumbling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Lady Moiraine,&rdquo; Mat echoed somewhat more
smoothly, but only a little.</p>

<p>She smiled, and Rand found himself wondering if there was
anything he might do for her, something that would give him an
excuse to stay near her. He knew she was smiling at all of them,
but it seemed meant for him alone. It really was just like seeing a
gleeman&rsquo;s tale come to life. Mat had a foolish grin on his
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know my name,&rdquo; she said, sounding delighted. As if her
presence, however brief, would not be the talk of the village for a
year! &ldquo;But you must call me Moiraine, not lady. And what are your
names?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ewin leaped forward before either of the others could speak. &ldquo;My
name is Ewin Finngar, my lady. I told them your name; that&rsquo;s how
they know. I heard Lan say it, but I wasn&rsquo;t eavesdropping. No one
like you has ever come to Emond&rsquo;s Field, before. There&rsquo;s a gleeman
in the village for Bel Tine, too. And tonight is Winternight. Will
you come to my house? My mother has apple cakes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall have to see,&rdquo; she replied, putting a hand on Ewin&rsquo;s
shoulder. Her eyes twinkled with amusement, though she gave no
other sign of it. &ldquo;I do not know how well I could compete against a
gleeman, Ewin. But you must all call me Moiraine.&rdquo; She looked
expectantly at Rand and Mat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Matrim Cauthon, La&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Moiraine,&rdquo; Mat said. He
made a stiff, jerking bow, then went red in the face as he
straightened.</p>

<p>Rand had been wondering if he should do something of the sort,
the way men did in stories, but with Mat&rsquo;s example, he merely spoke
his name. At least he did not stumble over his own tongue this
time.</p>

<p>Moiraine looked from him to Mat and back again. Rand thought her
smile, a bare curve of the corners of her mouth, was now the sort
Egwene wore when she had a secret. &ldquo;I may have some small tasks to
be done from time to time while I am in Emond&rsquo;s Field,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Perhaps you would be willing to assist me?&rdquo; She laughed as their
assents tumbled over one another. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she said, and Rand was
surprised when she pressed a coin into his palm, closing his hand
tightly around it with both of hers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need,&rdquo; he began, but she waved aside his protest as
she gave Ewin a coin as well, then pressed Mat&rsquo;s hand around one
the same way she had Rand&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course there is,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You cannot be expected to work
for nothing. Consider this a token, and keep it with you, so you
will remember that you have agreed to come to me when I ask it.
There is a bond between us now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget,&rdquo; Ewin piped up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Later we must talk,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and you must tell me all about
yourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lady&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I mean, Moiraine?&rdquo; Rand asked hesitantly as she
turned away. She stopped and looked back over her shoulder, and he
had to swallow before going on. &ldquo;Why have you come to Emond&rsquo;s
Field?&rdquo; Her expression was unchanged, but suddenly he wished he had
not asked, though he could not have said why. He rushed to explain
himself, anyway. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to be rude. I&rsquo;m sorry. It&rsquo;s just that no one comes
into the Two Rivers except the merchants, and peddlers when the
snow isn&rsquo;t too deep to get down from Baerlon. Almost no one.
Certainly no one like you. The merchants&rsquo; guards sometimes say this
is the back end of forever, and I suppose it must seem that way to
anyone from outside. I just wondered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her smile did fade then, slowly, as if something had been
recalled to her. For a moment she merely looked at him. &ldquo;I am a
student of history,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;a collector of old stories.
This place you call the Two Rivers has always interested me.
Sometimes I study the stories of what happened here long ago, here
and at other places.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stories?&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;What ever happened in the Two Rivers to
interest someone like&mdash;I mean, what could have happened
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what else would you call it beside the Two Rivers?&rdquo; Mat
added. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it has always been called.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the Wheel of Time turns,&rdquo; Moiraine said, half to herself and
with a distant look in her eyes, &ldquo;places wear many names. Men wear
many names, many faces. Different faces, but always the same man.
Yet no one knows the Great Pattern the Wheel weaves, or even the
Pattern of an Age. We can only watch, and study, and hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stared at her, unable to say a word, even to ask what she
meant. He was not sure she had meant for them to hear. The other
two were just as tongue-tied, he noticed. Ewin&rsquo;s mouth hung
open.</p>

<p>Moiraine focused on them again, and all three gave a little
shake as if waking up. &ldquo;Later we will talk,&rdquo; she said. None of them
said a word. &ldquo;Later.&rdquo; She moved on toward the Wagon Bridge,
appearing to glide over the ground rather than walk, her cloak
spreading on either side of her like wings.</p>

<p>As she left, a tall man Rand had not noticed before moved away
from the front of the inn and followed her, one hand resting on the
long hilt of a sword. His clothes were a dark grayish green that
would have faded into leaf or shadow, and his cloak swirled through
shades of gray and green and brown as it shifted in the wind. It
almost seemed to disappear at times, that cloak, fading into
whatever lay beyond it. His hair was long, and gray at the temples,
held back from his face by a narrow leather headband. That face was
made from stony planes and angles, weathered but unlined despite
the gray in his hair. When he moved, Rand could think of nothing
but a wolf.</p>

<p>In passing the three youths his gaze ran over them, eyes as cold
and blue as a midwinter dawn. It was as if he were weighing them in
his mind, and there was no sign on his face of what the scales told
him. He quickened his pace until he caught up to Moiraine, then
slowed to walk by her shoulder, bending to speak to her. Rand let
out a breath he had not realized he had been holding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was Lan,&rdquo; Ewin said throatily, as if he, too, had been
holding his breath. it had been that kind of look. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;s a
Warder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool.&rdquo; Mat laughed, but it was a shaky laugh.
&ldquo;Warders are just in stories. Anyway, Warders have swords and armor
covered in gold and jewels, and spend all their time up north, in
the Great Blight, fighting evil and Trollocs and such.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He <em>could</em> be a Warder,&rdquo; Ewin insisted</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see any gold or jewels on him?&rdquo; Mat scoffed. &ldquo;Do we
have Trollocs in the Two Rivers? We have sheep. I wonder what could
ever have happened here to interest someone like her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something could have,&rdquo; Rand answered slowly. &ldquo;They say the
inn&rsquo;s been here for a thousand years, maybe more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A thousand years of sheep,&rdquo; Mat said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A silver penny!&rdquo; Ewin burst out. &ldquo;She gave me a whole silver
penny! Think what I can buy when the peddler comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand opened his hand to look at the coin she had given him, and
almost dropped it in surprise. He did not recognize the fat silver
coin with the raised image of a woman balancing a single flame on
her upturned hand, but he had watched while Bran al&rsquo;Vere weighed
out the coins merchants brought from a dozen lands, and he had an
idea of its value. That much silver would buy a good horse anywhere
in the Two Rivers, with some left over.</p>

<p>He looked at Mat and saw the same stunned expression he knew
must be on his own face. Tilting his hand so Mat could see the coin
but not Ewin, he raised a questioning eyebrow. Mat nodded, and for
a minute they stared at one another in perplexed wonder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of chores does she have?&rdquo; Rand asked finally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Mat said firmly, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t care. I won&rsquo;t
spend it, either. Even when the peddler comes.&rdquo; With that he thrust
his coin into his coat pocket.</p>

<p>Nodding, Rand slowly did the same with his. He was not sure why,
but somehow what Mat said seemed right. The coin should not be
spent. Not when it came from her. He could not think of anything
else silver was good for, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think I should keep mine, too?&rdquo; Anguished indecision
painted Ewin&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not unless you want to,&rdquo; Mat said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think she gave it to you to spend,&rdquo; Rand said.</p>

<p>Ewin looked at his coin, then shook his head and stuffed the
silver penny into his pocket. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep it,&rdquo; he said
mournfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s still the gleeman,&rdquo; Rand said, and the younger boy
brightened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he ever wakes up,&rdquo; Mat added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand,&rdquo; Ewin asked, &ldquo;<em>is</em> there a gleeman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; Rand answered with a laugh. It was clear Ewin
would not believe until he set eyes on the gleeman. &ldquo;He has to come
down sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shouting drifted across the Wagon Bridge, and when Rand looked
to see what was causing it, his laughter became wholehearted. A
milling crowd of villagers, from gray-haired oldsters to toddlers
barely able to walk, escorted a tall wagon toward the bridge, a
huge wagon drawn by eight horses, the outside of its rounded canvas
cover hung about with bundles like bunches of grapes. The peddler
had come at last. Strangers and a gleeman, fireworks and a peddler.
It was going to be the best Bel Tine ever.</p>
