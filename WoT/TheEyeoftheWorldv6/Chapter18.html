Caemlyn Road was not very different from the North Road
through the Two Rivers. It was considerably wider, of course, and
showed the wear of much more use, but it was still hard-packed
dirt, lined on either side by trees that would not have been at all
out of place in the Two Rivers, especially since only the
evergreens carried a leaf.</p>

<p>The land itself was different, though, for by midday the road
entered low hills. For two days the road ran through the hills&mdash;cut right through them, sometimes, if they were wide enough

as supper would be. &ldquo;Not a chance of tea. Nice hot tea.&rdquo; She pulled
her cloak tighter and shifted around the tree in a vain effort to
avoid the swirling wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Flatwort tea and andilay root,&rdquo; Nynaeve was saying to Moiraine,
&ldquo;are best for fatigue. They clear the head a
