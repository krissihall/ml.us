single lantern, its shutters half closed, hung from a nail on
a stall post, casting a dim light. Deep shadows swallowed most of
the stalls. As Rand came through the doors from the stableyard,
hard on the heels of Mat and the Warder, Perrin leaped up in a
rustle of straw from where he had been sitting with his back
against a stall door. A heavy cloak swathed him.</p>

<p>Lan barely paused to demand, &ldquo;Did you look the way I told you,
blacksmith?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I looked,&rdquo; Perrin replied. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nobody here but us. Why
would anybody hide&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Care and a long life go together, blacksmith.&rdquo; The Warder ran a
quick eye around the shadowed stable and the deeper shadows of the
hayloft above, then shook his head. &ldquo;No time,&rdquo; he muttered, half to
himself. &ldquo;Hurry, she says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As if to suit his words, he strode quickly to where the five
horses stood tethered, bridled and saddled at the back of the pool
of light. Two were the black stallion and white mare that Rand had
seen before. The others, if not quite so tall or so sleek,
certainly appeared to be among the best the Two Rivers had to
offer. With hasty care Lan began examining cinches and girth
straps, and the leather ties that held saddlebags, water-skins, and
blanket-rolls behind the saddles.</p>

<p>Rand exchanged shaky smiles with his friends, trying hard to
look as if he really was eager to be off.</p>

<p>For the first time Mat noticed the sword at Rand&rsquo;s waist, and
pointed to it. &ldquo;You becoming a Warder?&rdquo; He laughed, then swallowed
it with a quick glance at Lan. The Warder apparently took no
notice. &ldquo;Or at least a merchant&rsquo;s guard,&rdquo; Mat went on with a grin
that seemed only a little forced. He hefted his bow. &ldquo;An honest
man&rsquo;s weapon isn&rsquo;t good enough for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand thought about flourishing the sword; but Lan being there
stopped him. The Warder was not even looking in his direction, but
he was sure the man was aware of everything that went on around
him. Instead he said with exaggerated casualness, &ldquo;It might be
useful,&rdquo; as if wearing a sword were nothing out of the
ordinary.</p>

<p>Perrin moved, trying to hide something under his cloak. Rand
glimpsed a wide leather belt encircling the apprentice blacksmith&rsquo;s
waist, with the handle of an axe thrust through a loop on the
belt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you have there?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Merchant&rsquo;s guard, indeed,&rdquo; Mat hooted.</p>

<p>The shaggy-haired youth gave Mat a frown that suggested he had
already had more than his fair share of joking, then sighed heavily
and tossed back his cloak to uncover the axe. It was no comrnon
woodsman&rsquo;s tool. A broad half-moon blade on one side of the head
and a curved spike on the other made it every bit as strange for
the Two Rivers as Rand&rsquo;s sword. Perrin&rsquo;s hand rested on it with a
sense of familiarity, though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Luhhan made it about two years ago, for a wool-buyer&rsquo;s
guard. But when it was done the fellow wouldn&rsquo;t pay what he had
agreed, and Master Luhhan would not take less. He gave it to me
when&rdquo;&mdash;he cleared his throat, then shot Rand the same warning
frown he&rsquo;d given Mat&mdash;&ldquo;when he found me practicing with it. He
said I might as well have it since he couldn&rsquo;t make anything useful
from it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Practicing,&rdquo; Mat snickered, but held up his hands soothingly
when Perrin raised his head. &ldquo;As you say. It&rsquo;s just as well one of
us knows how to use a real
weapon&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That bow is a real weapon,&rdquo; Lan said suddenly. He dropped an
arm across the saddle of his tall black and regarded hem gravely.
&ldquo;So are the slings I&rsquo;ve seen you village boys with. Just because
you never used them for anything but hunting rabbits or chasing a
wolf away from the sheep makes no difference. Anything can be a
weapon, if the man or woman who holds it has the nerve and will to
make it so. Trollocs aside, you had better have that clear in your
minds before we leave the Two Rivers, before we leave Emond&rsquo;s
Field, if you want to reach Tar Valon alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His face and voice, cold as death and hard as a rough-hewn
gravestone, stifled their smiles and their tongues. Perrin grimaced
and pulled his cloak back over the axe. Mat stared at his feet and
stirred the straw on the stable floor with his toe. The Warder
grunted and went back to his checking, and the silence
lengthened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t much like the stories,&rdquo; Mat said, finally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know,&rdquo; Perrin said sourly. &ldquo;Trollocs, a Warder, an Aes Sedai. What
more could you ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Mat whispered, sounding as if he were suddenly
cold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you believe her, Rand?&rdquo; Perrin asked. &ldquo;I mean, what would
Trollocs want with us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As one, they glanced at the Warder. Lan appeared absorbed in the
white mare&rsquo;s saddle girth, but the three of them moved back toward
the stable door, away from Lan. Even so, they huddled together and
spoke softly.</p>

<p>Rand shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but she had it right about
our farms being the only ones attacked. And they attacked Master
Luhhan&rsquo;s house and the forge first, here in the village. I asked
the Mayor. It&rsquo;s as easy to believe they are after us as anything
else I can think of.&rdquo; Suddenly he realized they were both staring
at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You asked the Mayor?&rdquo; Mat said incredulously. &ldquo;She said not to
tell anybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell him why I was asking,&rdquo; Rand protested. &ldquo;Do you
mean you didn&rsquo;t talk to anybody at all? You didn&rsquo;t let anybody know
you&rsquo;re going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin shrugged defensively. &ldquo;Moiraine Sedai said not
anybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We left notes,&rdquo; Mat said. &ldquo;For our families. They&rsquo;ll find them
in the morning. Rand, my mother thinks Tar Valon is the next thing
to Shayol Ghul.&rdquo; He gave a little laugh to show he did not share
her opinion. It was not very convincing. &ldquo;She&rsquo;d try to lock me in
the cellar if she believed I was even thinking of going there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Luhhan is stubborn as stone,&rdquo; Perrin added, &ldquo;and
Mistress Luhhan is worse. If you&rsquo;d seen her digging through what&rsquo;s
left of the house, saying she hoped the Trollocs did come back so
she could get her hands on them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn me, Rand,&rdquo; Mat said, &ldquo;I know she&rsquo;s an Aes Sedai and all,
but the Trollocs were really here. She said not to tell anybody. If
an Aes Sedai doesn&rsquo;t know what to do about some thing like this,
who does?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Rand rubbed at his forehead. His head hurt; He
could not get that dream out of his mind. &ldquo;My father believes her.
At least, he agreed that we had to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly Moiraine was in the doorway. &ldquo;You talked to your rather
about this journey?&rdquo; She was clothed in dark gray from lead to
foot, with a skirt divided for riding astride, and the serpent ring
was the only gold she wore now.</p>

<p>Rand eyed her walking staff;
despite the flames he had seen, here was no sign of charring, or
even soot. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t go off without letting him know.&rdquo; She eyed him for
a moment with pursed lips before turning to the others. &ldquo;And did
you also decide that a note was not enough?&rdquo; Mat and Perrin talked
on top of each other, assuring her they had only left notes, the
way she had said. Nodding, she waved them to silence, and gave Rand
a sharp look. &ldquo;What s done is already woven in the Pattern.
Lan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The horses are ready,&rdquo; the Warder said, &ldquo;and we have enough
provisions to reach Baerlon with some to spare. We can leave at any
time. I suggest now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not without me.&rdquo; Egwene slipped into the stable, a shawl
wrapped bundle in her arms. Rand nearly fell over his own feet.</p>

<p>Lan&rsquo;s sword had come half out of its sheath; when he saw who it
was he shoved the blade back, his eyes suddenly flat. Perrin and
Mat began babbling to convince Moiraine they had not told Egwene
about leaving. The Aes Sedai ignored them; she simply looked at
Egwene, tapping her lips thoughtfully with her finger.</p>

<p>The hood of Egwene&rsquo;s dark brown cloak was pulled up, but not
enough to hide the defiant way she faced Moiraine. &ldquo;I have
everything I need here. Including food. And I will not be left
behind. I&rsquo;ll probably never get another chance to see the world
outside the Two Rivers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a picnic trip into the Waterwood, Egwene,&rdquo; Mat
growled. He stepped back when she looked at him from under lowered
brows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mat. I wouldn&rsquo;t have known. If you think you three
are the only ones who want to see what&rsquo;s outside? I&rsquo;ve dreamed
about it as long as you have, and I don&rsquo;t intend to miss this
chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you find out we were leaving?&rdquo; Rand demanded. &ldquo;Anyway,
you can&rsquo;t go with us. We aren&rsquo;t leaving for the fun of it. The
Trollocs are after us.&rdquo; She gave him a tolerant look, and he
flushed and stiffened indignantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First,&rdquo; she told him patiently, &ldquo;I saw Mat creeping about,
trying hard not to be noticed. Then I saw Perrin attempting to hide
that absurd great axe under his cloak. I knew Lan had bought a
horse, and it suddenly occurred to me to wonder why he needed
another. And if he could buy one, he could buy others. Putting that
with Mat and Perrin sneaking about like bull calves pretending to
be foxes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well, I could see only one answer. I don&rsquo;t know if
I&rsquo;m surprised or not to find you here, Rand, after all your talk
about daydreams. With Mat and Perrin involved, I suppose I should
have known you would be in it, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to go, Egwene,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;All of us do, or the
Trollocs will come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Trollocs!&rdquo; Egwene laughed incredulously. &ldquo;Rand, if you&rsquo;ve
decided to see some of the world, well and good, but please spare
me any of your nonsensical tales.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Perrin said as Mat began, &ldquo;The Trollocs&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; Moiraine said quietly, but it cut their talk as
sharply as a knife. &ldquo;Did anyone else notice all of this?&rdquo; Her voice
was soft, but Egwene swallowed and drew herself up before
answering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After last night, all they can think about is rebuilding, that
and what to do if it happens again. They couldn&rsquo;t see anything else
unless it was pushed under their noses. And I told no one what I
suspected. No one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Moiraine said after a moment. &ldquo;You may come with
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A startled expression darted across Lan&rsquo;s face. It was gone in
an instant, leaving him outwardly calm, but furious words erupted
from him. &ldquo;No, Moiraine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is part of the Pattern, now, Lan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is ridiculous!&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason for her to
come along, and every reason for her not to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There <em>is</em> a reason for it,&rdquo; Moiraine said calmly. &ldquo;A part of the
Pattern, Lan.&rdquo; The Warder&rsquo;s stony face showed nothing but he nodded
slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Egwene,&rdquo; Rand said, &ldquo;the Trollocs will be chasing us. We
won&rsquo;t be safe until we get to Tar Valon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to frighten me off,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand knew that tone of voice. He had not heard it since she
decided that climbing the tallest trees was for children, but he
remembered it well. &ldquo;If you think being chased by Trollocs will be
fun,&rdquo; he began, but Moiraine interrupted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have no time for this. We must be as far away as possible by
daybreak. If she is left behind, Rand, she could rouse the village
before we have gone a mile, and that would surely warn the
Myrddraal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not do that,&rdquo; Egwene protested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She can ride the gleeman&rsquo;s horse,&rdquo; the Warder said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave
him enough to buy another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will not be possible,&rdquo; came Thom Merrilin&rsquo;s resonant voice
from the hayloft. Lan&rsquo;s sword left its sheath this time, and he did
not put it back as he stared up at the gleeman.</p>

<p>Thom tossed down a blanket-roll, then slung his cased flute and
harp across his back and shouldered bulging saddlebags. &ldquo;This village has
no use for me, now, while on the other hand, I
have never performed in Tar Valon. And though I usually journey
alone, after last night I have no objections at all to traveling in
company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Warder gave Perrin a hard look, and Perrin shifted
uncomfortably. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think of looking in the loft,&rdquo; he
muttered.</p>

<p>As the long-limbed gleeman scrambled down the ladder from the
loft, Lan spoke, stiffly formal. &ldquo;Is this part of the Pattern, too,
Moiraine Sedai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything is a part of the Pattern, my old friend,&rdquo; Moiraine
replied softly. &ldquo;We cannot pick and choose. But we shall see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom put his feet on the stable floor and turned from the
ladder, brushing straw from his patch-covered cloak. &ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; he
said in more normal tones, &ldquo;you might say that I insist on
traveling in company. I have given many hours over many mugs of ale
to thinking of how I might end my days. A Trolloc&rsquo;s cookpot was not
one of the thoughts. &ldquo;He looked askance at the Warder&rsquo;s sword.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for that. I am not a cheese for slicing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Merrilin,&rdquo; Moiraine said, &ldquo;we must go quickly, and
almost certainly in great danger. The Trollocs are still out there,
and we go by night. Are you sure that you want to travel with
us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom eyed the lot of them with a quizzical smile. &ldquo;If it is not
too dangerous for the girl, it can&rsquo;t be too dangerous for me.
Besides, what gleeman would not face a little danger to perform in
Tar Valon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine nodded, and Lan scabbarded his sword. Rand suddenly
wondered what would have happened if Thom had changed his mind, or
if Moiraine had not nodded. The gleeman began saddling his horse as
if similar thoughts had never crossed his mind, but Rand noticed
that he eyed Lan&rsquo;s sword more than once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;What horse for Egwene?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The peddler&rsquo;s horses are as bad as the Dhurrans,&rdquo; the Warder
replied sourly. &ldquo;Strong, but slow plodders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bela,&rdquo; Rand said, getting a look from Lan that made him wish he
had kept silent. But he knew he could not dissuade Egwene; the only
thing left was to help. &ldquo;Bela may not be as fast as the others, but
she&rsquo;s strong. I ride her sometimes. She can keep up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan looked into Bela&rsquo;s stall, muttering under his breath. &ldquo;She
might be a little better than the others,&rdquo; he said finally. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t suppose there is any other choice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then she will have to do,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;Rand, find a saddle
for Bela. Quickly, now! We have tarried too long already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand hurriedly chose a saddle and blanket in the tack room, then
fetched Bela from her stall. The mare looked back at him in sleepy
surprise when he put the saddle on her back. When he rode her, it
was barebacked; she was not used to a saddle. He made soothing
noises while he tightened the girth strap, and she accepted the
oddity with no more than a shake of her mane.</p>

<p>Taking Egwene&rsquo;s
bundle from her, he tied it on behind the saddle while she mounted
and adjusted her skirts. They were not divided for riding astride,
so her wool stockings were bared to the knee. She wore the same soft
leather shoes as all the other village girls. They were not at all
suited for journeying to Watch Hill, much less Tar Valon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I still think you shouldn&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t making it
up about the Trollocs. But I promise I will take care of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;ll take care of you,&rdquo; she replied lightly. At his
exasperated look she smiled and bent down to smooth his hair. I
know you&rsquo;ll look after me, Rand. We will look after each other. But
now you had better look after getting on your horse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All of the others were already mounted and waiting for him, he
realized. The only horse left riderless was Cloud, a tall gray with
a black mane and tail that belonged to Jon Thane, or had. He
scrambled into the saddle, though not without difficulty as the
gray tossed his head and pranced sideways as Rand put his foot in
the stirrup, and his scabbard caught in his legs. It was not
chance, that his friends had not chosen Cloud. Master Thane often
raced the spirited gray against merchants&rsquo; horses, and Rand had
never known him to lose, but he had never known Cloud to give
anyone an easy ride, either. Lan must have given a huge price to
make the miller sell. As he settled in the saddle Cloud&rsquo;s dancing
increased, as if the gray were eager to run. Rand gripped the reins
firmly and tried to think that he would have no trouble. Perhaps if
he convinced himself, he could convince the horse, too.</p>

<p>An owl hooted in the night outside, and the village people
jumped before they realized what it was. They laughed nervously and
exchanged shamefaced looks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Next thing, field mice will chase us up a tree,&rdquo; Egwene said
with an unsteady chuckle.</p>

<p>Lan shook his head. &ldquo;Better if it had been wolves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wolves!&rdquo; Perrin exclaimed, and the Warder favored him with a
flat stare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wolves don&rsquo;t like Trollocs, blacksmith, and Trollocs don&rsquo;t like
wolves, or dogs, either. If I heard wolves I would be sure there
were no Trollocs waiting out there for us.&rdquo; He moved into the
moonlit night, walking his tall black slowly.</p>

<p>Moiraine rode after him without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, and
Egwene kept hard to the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s side. Rand and the gleeman
brought up the rear, following Mat and Perrin.</p>

<p>The back of the inn was dark and silent, and dappled moon
shadows filled the stableyard. The soft thuds of the hooves faded
quickly, swallowed by the night. In the darkness the Warder&rsquo;s cloak
made him a shadow, too. Only the need to let him lead the way kept
the others from clustering around him. Getting out of the village
without being seen was going to be no easy task, Rand decided as he
neared the gate. At least, without being seen by villagers. Many
windows in the village emitted pale yellow light, and although
those glows seemed very small in the night now, shapes moved
frequently within them, the shapes of villagers watching to see
what this night brought. No one wanted to be caught by surprise
again.</p>

<p>In the deep shadows beside the inn, just on the point of leaving
the stableyard, Lan abruptly halted, motioning sharply for silence.</p>

<p>Boots rattled on the Wagon Bridge, and here and there on the bridge
moonlight glinted off metal. The boots clattered across the bridge,
grated on gravel, and approached the inn. No sound at all came from
those in the shadow. Rand suspected his friends, at least, were too
frightened to make a noise. Like him.</p>

<p>The footsteps halted before the inn in the grayness just beyond
the dim light from the common-room windows. It was not until Jon
Thane stepped forward, a spear propped on his stout shoulder, an
old jerkin sewn all over with steel disks straining across his
chest, that Rand saw them for what they were. A dozen men from the
village and the surrounding farms, some in helmets or pieces of
armor that had lain dust-covered in attics for generations, all
with a spear or a woodaxe or a rusty bill.</p>

<p>The miller peered into a common-room window, then turned with a
curt, &ldquo;It looks right here.&rdquo; The others formed in two ragged ranks
behind him, and the patrol marched into the night as if stepping to
three different drums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two Dha&rsquo;vol Trollocs would have them all for breakfast,&rdquo; Lan
muttered when the sound of their boots had faded, &ldquo;but they have
eyes and ears.&rdquo; He turned his stallion back. &ldquo;Come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slowly, quietly, the Warder took them back across the
stableyard, down the bank through the willows and into the
Winespring Water. So close to the Winespring itself the cold, swift
water, gleaming as it swirled around the horses&rsquo; legs, was deep
enough to lap against the soles of the riders&rsquo; boots.</p>

<p>Climbing out on the far bank, the line of horses wound its way
under the Warder&rsquo;s deft direction, keeping away from any the
village houses. From time to time Lan stopped, signing them all to
be quiet, though no one else heard or saw anything. Each time he
did, however, another patrol of villagers and farmers soon passed.
Slowly they moved toward the north edge of the village.</p>

<p>Rand peered at the high-peaked houses in the dark, trying to
impress them on his memory. <em>A fine adventurer I am</em>, he thought. He
was not even out of the village yet, and already he was homesick.
But he did not stop looking.</p>

<p>They passed beyond the last farmhouses on the outskirts of the
village and into the countryside, paralleling the North Road that
led to Taren Ferry. Rand thought that surely no night sky elsewhere
could be as beautiful as the Two Rivers sky. The near black seemed
to reach to forever, and myriad stars gleamed like points of light
scattered through crystal. The moon, only a thin slice less than
full, appeared almost close enough to touch, if he stretched, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A black shape flew slowly across the silvery ball of the moon.
Rand&rsquo;s involuntary jerk on the reins halted the gray. A bat, he
thought weakly, but he knew it was not. Bats were a common sight of
an evening, darting after flies and bitemes in the twilight. The
wings that carried this creature might have the same shape, but
they moved with the slow, powerful sweep of a bird prey. And it was
hunting. The way it cast back and forth in long arcs left no doubt
of that. Worst of all was the size. For a bat to seem so large
against the moon it would have had to be almost within arm&rsquo;s reach.
He tried to judge in his mind how far away it must be, and how big.
The body of it had to be as large as a man, and the wings&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;It
crossed the face of the moon again, wheeling suddenly downward to
be engulfed by the night.</p>

<p>He did not realize that Lan had ridden back to him until the
Warder caught his arm. &ldquo;What are you sitting here and staring at,
boy? We have to keep moving.&rdquo; The others waited behind Lan.</p>

<p>Half expecting to be told he was letting fear of the Trollocs
overcome his sense, Rand told what he had seen. He hoped that Lan
would dismiss it as a bat, or a trick of his eyes.</p>

<p>Lan growled a word, sounding as if it left a bad taste in his,
mouth. &ldquo;Draghkar.&rdquo; Egwene and the other Two Rivers folk stared at
the sky nervously in all directions, but the gleeman groaned
softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;It is too much to hope otherwise. And if
the Myrddraal has a Draghkar at his command, then he will
soon know where we are, if he does not already. We must move more
quickly than we can cross-country. We may still reach Taren Ferry
ahead of the Myrddraal, and he and his Trollocs will not cross as
easily as we.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Draghkar?&rdquo; Egwene said. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Thom Merrilin who answered her hoarsely. &ldquo;In the war that
ended the Age of Legends, worse than Trollocs and Halfmen were
created.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine&rsquo;s head jerked toward him as he spoke. Not even the dark
could hide the sharpness of her look.</p>

<p>Before anyone could ask the gleeman for more, Lan began giving
directions. &ldquo;We take to the North Road, now. For your lives, follow
my lead, keep up and keep together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He wheeled his horse about, and the others galloped wordlessly
after him.</p>
