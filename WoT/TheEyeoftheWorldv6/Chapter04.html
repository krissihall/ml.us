<h4><em>The Gleeman</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
door of the inn banged shut behind the white-haired man, and
he spun around to glare at it. Lean, he would have been tall if not
for a stoop to his shoulders, but he moved in a spry fashion that
belied his apparent age. His cloak seemed a mass of patches, in odd
shapes and sizes, fluttering with every breath of air, patches in a
hundred colors. It was really quite thick, Rand saw, despite what
Master al&rsquo;Vere had said, with the patches merely sewn on like
decorations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gleeman!&rdquo; Egwene whispered excitedly.</p>

<p>The white-haired man whirled, cloak flaring. His long coat had
odd, baggy sleeves and big pockets. Thick mustaches, as snowy as
the hair on his head, quivered around his mouth, and his face was
gnarled like a tree that had seen hard times. He gestured
imperiously at Rand and the others with a long-stemmed pipe,
ornately carved, that trailed a wisp of smoke. Blue eyes peered out
from under bushy white brows, drilling into whatever he looked
at.</p>

<p>Rand stared at the man&rsquo;s eyes almost as much as at the rest of
him. Everybody in the Two Rivers had dark eyes, and so did most of
the merchants, and their guards, and everyone else he had ever
seen. The Congars and the Coplins had made fun of him for his gray
eyes, until the day he finally punched Ewal Coplin in the nose; the
Wisdom had surely gotten onto him for that. He wondered if there
was a place where nobody had dark eyes. <em>Maybe Lan comes from there,
too</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What sort of place is this?&rdquo; the gleeman demanded in a deep
voice that sounded in some way larger than that of an ordinary man.
Even in the open air it seemed to fill a great room and resonate
from the walls. &ldquo;The yokels in that village on the hill tell me I
can get here before dark, neglecting to say that that was only if I
left well before noon. When I finally do arrive, chilled to the
bone and ready for a warm bed, your innkeeper grumbles about the
hour as if I were a wandering swineherd and your Village Council
hadn&rsquo;t begged me to display my art at this festival of yours. And
he never even told me he was the Mayor.&rdquo; He slowed for a breath,
taking them all in with a glare, but he was off again on the
instant. &ldquo;When I came downstairs to smoke my pipe before the fire
and have a mug of ale, every man in the common room stares at me as
if I were his least favorite brother-in-law seeking to borrow
money. One old grandfather starts ranting at me about the kind of
stories I should or should not tell, then a girl-child shouts at me
to get out, and threatens me with a great club when I don&rsquo;t move
quickly enough for her. Who ever heard of treating a gleeman
so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene&rsquo;s face was a study, her goggle-eyed amaze at a gleeman in
the flesh marred by a desire to defend Nynaeve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your pardon, Master Gleeman,&rdquo; Rand said. He knew he was
grinning foolishly, himself. &ldquo;That was our Wisdom, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That pretty little slip of a girl?&rdquo; the gleeman exclaimed. &ldquo;A
village Wisdom? Why, at her age she should better be flirting with
the young men than foretelling the weather and curing the
sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shifted uncomfortably. He hoped Nynaeve never overheard the
man&rsquo;s opinion. At least, not until he had done with his performing.
Perrin winced at the gleeman&rsquo;s words, and Mat whistled soundlessly,
as if both had had the same thought as he had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The men were the Village Council,&rdquo; Rand went on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they
intended no discourtesy. You see, we just learned there&rsquo;s a war in
Ghealdan, and a man claiming to be the Dragon Reborn. A false
Dragon. Aes Sedai are riding there from Tar Valon. The Council is
trying to decide if we might be in danger here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old news, even in Baerlon,&rdquo; the gleeman said dismissively, &ldquo;and
that is the last place in the world to hear anything.&rdquo; He paused,
looking around the village, and dryly added, &ldquo;Almost the last
place.&rdquo; Then his eyes fell on the wagon in front of the inn,
standing alone now, with its shafts on the ground. &ldquo;So. I thought I
recognized Padan Fain in there.&rdquo; His voice was still deep, but the
resonance had gone, replaced by scorn. &ldquo;Fain was always one to
carry bad news quickly, and the worse, the faster. There&rsquo;s more
raven in him than man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Fain has come often to Emond&rsquo;s Field, Master Gleeman,&rdquo;
Egwene said, a hint of disapproval finally breaking through her
delight. &ldquo;He is always full of laughter, and he brings much more
good news than bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gleeman eyed her for a moment, then smiled broadly. &ldquo;Now
you&rsquo;re a lovely lass. You should have rose buds in your hair.
Unfortunately, I cannot pull roses from the air, not this year, but
how would you like to stand beside me tomorrow for a part of my
performance? Hand me my flute when I want it, and certain other
apparatus. I always choose the prettiest girl I can find as my
assistant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin snickered, and Mat, who had been snickering, laughed out
loud. Rand blinked in surprise; Egwene was glaring at him, and he
had not even smiled. She straightened around and spoke in a
too-calm voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Master Gleeman. I would be happy to assist you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thom Merrilin,&rdquo; the gleeman said. They stared. &ldquo;My name is Thom
Merrilin, not Master Gleeman.&rdquo; He hitched the multihued cloak up on
his shoulders, and abruptly his voice once more seemed to
reverberate in a great hall. &ldquo;Once a Court bard, I am now indeed
risen to the exalted rank of Master Gleeman, yet my name is plain
Thom Merrilin, and gleeman is the simple title in which I glory.&rdquo;
And he swept a bow so elaborate with flourishes of his cloak that
Mat clapped and Egwene murmured appreciatively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Master Merrilin,&rdquo; Mat said, unsure
exactly what form of address to take out of what Thom Merrilin had
said, &ldquo;what <em>is</em> happening in Ghealdan? Do you know anything about
this false Dragon? Or the Aes Sedai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I look like a peddler, boy?&rdquo; the gleeman grumbled, tapping
out his pipe on the heel of his palm. He made the pipe disappear
somewhere inside his cloak, or his coat; Rand was not sure where it
had gone or how. &ldquo;I am a gleeman, not a newsmonger. And I make a
point of never knowing anything about Aes Sedai. Much safer that
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the war,&rdquo; Mat began eagerly, only to be cut off by Master
Merrilin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In wars, boy, fools kill other fools for foolish causes. That&rsquo;s
enough for anyone to know. I am here for my art.&rdquo; Suddenly he
thrust a finger at Rand. &ldquo;You, lad. You&rsquo;re a tall one. Not with
your full growth on you yet, but I doubt there&rsquo;s another man in the
district with your height. Not many in the village with eyes that
color, either, I&rsquo;ll wager. The point is, you&rsquo;re an axe handle
across the shoulders and as tall as an Aielman. What&rsquo;s your name,
lad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand gave it hesitantly, not sure whether or not the man was
making fun of him, but the gleeman had already turned his attention
to Perrin. &ldquo;And you have almost the size of an Ogier. Close enough.
How are you called?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not unless I stand on my own shoulders.&rdquo; Perrin laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid Rand and I are just ordinary folk, Master Merrilin, not
made-up creatures from your stories. I&rsquo;m Perrin Aybara.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Merrilin tugged at one of his mustaches. &ldquo;Well, now. Made-up
creatures from my stories. Is that what they are? You lads are
widely traveled, then, it seems.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand kept his mouth shut, certain they were the butt of a joke,
now, but Perrin spoke up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all of us been as far as Watch Hill, and Deven Ride. Not
many around here have gone as far.&rdquo; He was not boasting; Perrin
seldom did. He was just telling the truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all seen the Mire, too,&rdquo; Mat added, and he did sound
boastful. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the swamp at the far end of the Waterwood. Nobody
at all goes there&mdash;it&rsquo;s full of quicksands and bogs&mdash;except
us. And nobody goes to the Mountains of Mist, either, but we did,
once. To the foot of them, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As far as that?&rdquo; the gleeman murmured, brushing at his
mustaches now continually. Rand thought he was hiding a smile, and
he saw that Perrin was frowning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad luck to enter the mountains,&rdquo; Mat said, as if he had
to defend himself for not going further. &ldquo;Everybody knows
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just foolishness, Matrim Cauthon,&rdquo; Egwene cut in
angrily. &ldquo;Nynaeve says&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She broke off, her cheeks turning
pink, and the look she gave Thom Merrilin was not as friendly as it
had been. &ldquo;It is not right to make&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;It isn&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Her face
went redder, and she fell silent. Mat blinked, as if he was just
getting a suspicion of what had been going on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, child,&rdquo; the gleeman said contritely. &ldquo;I apologize
humbly. I am here to entertain. Aah, my tongue has always gotten me
into trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe we haven&rsquo;t traveled as far as you,&rdquo; Perrin said flatly,
&ldquo;but what does how tall Rand is have to do with anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just this, lad. A little later I will let you try to pick me
up, but you won&rsquo;t be able to lift my feet from the ground. Not you,
nor your tall friend there&mdash;Rand, is it?&mdash;nor any other
man. Now what do you think of that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin snorted a laugh. &ldquo;I think I can lift you right now.&rdquo; But
when he stepped forward Thom Merrilin motioned him back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Later, lad, later. When there are more folk to watch. An artist
needs an audience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A score of folk had gathered on the Green since the gleeman
appeared from the inn, young men and women down to children who
peeked, wide-eyed and silent, from behind the older onlookers. All
looked as if they were waiting for miraculous things from the
gleeman. The white-haired man looked them over&mdash;he appeared
to be counting them&mdash;then gave a slight shake of his head and
sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I had better give you a small sample. So you can run
tell the others. Eh? Just a taste of what you&rsquo;ll see tomorrow at
your festival.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took a step back, and suddenly leaped into the air, twisting
and somersaulting to land facing them atop the old stone
foundation. More than that, three balls&mdash;red, white, and black&mdash;began dancing between his hands even as he landed.</p>

<p>A soft sound came from the watchers, half astonishment, half
satisfaction. Even Rand forgot his irritation. He flashed Egwene a
grin and got a delighted one in return, then both turned to stare
unabashedly at the gleeman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want stories?&rdquo; Thom Merrilin declaimed. &ldquo;I have stories,
and I will give them to you. I will make them come alive before
your eyes.&rdquo; A blue ball joined the others from somewhere, then a
green one, and a yellow. &ldquo;Tales of great wars and great heroes, for
the men and boys. For the women and girls, the entire <em>Aptarigine
Cycle</em>. Tales of Artur Paendrag Tanreall, Artur Hawkwing, Artur the
High King, who once ruled all the lands from the Aiel Waste to the
Aryth Ocean, and even beyond. Wondrous stories of strange people
and strange lands, of the Green Man, of Warders and Trollocs, of
Ogier and Aiel, <em>The Thousand Tales of Anla, the Wise Counselor</em>.
&lsquo;Jaem the GiantSlayer&rsquo;. <em>How Susa Tamed Jain Farstrider</em>. &lsquo;Mara and
the Three Foolish Kings.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell us about Lenn,&rdquo; Egwene called. &ldquo;How he flew to the moon in
the belly of an eagle made of fire. Tell about his daughter Salya
walking among the stars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand looked at her out of the corner of his eye, but she seemed
intent on the gleeman. She had never liked stories about adventures
and long journeys. Her favorites were always the funny ones, or
stories about women outwitting people who were supposed to be
smarter than everyone else. He was sure she had asked for tales
about Lenn and Salya to put a burr under his shirt. Surely she
could see the world outside was no place for Two Rivers folk.
Listening to tales of adventures, even dreaming about them, was one
thing; having them take place around you would be something else
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old stories, those,&rdquo; Thom Merrilin said, and abruptly he was
juggling three colored balls with each hand. &ldquo;Stories from the Age
before the Age of Legends, some say. Perhaps even older. But I have
<em>all</em> stories, mind you now, of Ages that were and will be. Ages when
men ruled the heavens and the stars, and Ages when man roamed as
brother to the animals. Ages of wonder, and Ages of horror. Ages
ended by fire raining from the skies, and Ages doomed by snow and
ice covering land and sea. I have all stories, and I will tell all
stories. Tales of Mosk the Giant, with his Lance of Fire that could
reach around the world, and his wars with Alsbet, the Queen of All.
Tales of Materese the Healer, Mother of the Wondrous Ind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The balls now danced between Thom&rsquo;s hands in two intertwining
circles. His voice was almost a chant, and he turned slowly as he
spoke, as if surveying the onlookers to gauge his effect. &ldquo;I will
tell you of the end of the Age of Legends, of the Dragon, and his
attempt to free the Dark One into the world of men. I will tell of
the Time of Madness, when Aes Sedai shattered the world; of the
Trolloc Wars, when men battled Trollocs for rule of the earth; of
the War of the Hundred Years, when men battled men and the nations
of our day were wrought. I will tell the adventures of men and
women, rich and poor, great and small, proud and humble. <em>The Siege
of the Pillars of the Sky</em>. &lsquo;How Goodwife Karil Cured Her Husband of
Snoring.&rsquo; <em>King Darith and the Fall of the House of</em>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly the flow of words and the juggling alike stopped. Thom
simply snatched the balls from the air and stopped talking.
Unnoticed by Rand, Moiraine had joined the listeners. Lan was at
her shoulder, though he had to look twice to see the man. For a
moment Thom looked at Moiraine sideways, his face and body still
except for making the balls disappear into his capacious coat
sleeves. Then he bowed to her, holding his cloak wide. &ldquo;Your
pardon, but you are surely not from this district?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lady!&rdquo; Ewin hissed fiercely. &ldquo;The Lady Moiraine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom blinked, then bowed again, more deeply. &ldquo;Your pardon again&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ah, Lady. I meant no disrespect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine made a small waving-away gesture. &ldquo;None was perceived,
Master Bard. And my name is simply Moiraine. I am indeed a stranger
here, a traveler like yourself, far from home and alone. The world
can be a dangerous place when one is a stranger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Lady Moiraine collects stories,&rdquo; Ewin put in. &ldquo;Stories
about things that happened in the Two Rivers. Though I don&rsquo;t know
what ever happened here to make a story of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I trust you will like my stories, as well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Moiraine.&rdquo; Thom
watched her with obvious wariness. He looked not best pleased to
find her there. Suddenly Rand wondered what sort of entertainment a
lady like her might be offered in a city like Baerlon, or Caemlyn.
Surely it could not be anything better than a gleeman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a matter of taste, Master Bard,&rdquo; Moiraine replied.
&ldquo;Some stories I like, and some I do not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom&rsquo;s bow was his deepest yet, bending his long body parallel
to the ground. &ldquo;I assure you, none of my stories will displease.
All will please and entertain. And you do me too much honor. I am a
simple gleeman; that and nothing more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine answered his bow with a gracious nod. For an instant
she seemed even more the lady Ewin had named her, accepting an
offering from one of her subjects. Then she turned away, and Lan
followed, a wolf heeling a gliding swan. Thom stared after them,
bushy brows drawn down, stroking his
long mustaches with a knuckle, until they were halfway up the
Green. <em>He&rsquo;s not pleased at all</em>, Rand thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to juggle some more, now?&rdquo; Ewin demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eat fire,&rdquo; Mat shouted. &ldquo;I want to see you eat fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The harp!&rdquo; a voice cried from the crowd. &ldquo;Play the harp!&rdquo;
Someone else called for the flute.</p>

<p>At that moment the door of the inn opened and the Village
Council trundled out, Nynaeve in their midst. Padan Fain was not
with them, Rand saw; apparently the peddler had decided to remain
in the warm common room with his mulled wine.</p>

<p>Muttering about &ldquo;a strong brandy,&rdquo; Thom Merrilin abruptly jumped
down from the old foundation. He ignored the cries of those who had
been watching him, pressing inside past the Councilors before they
were well out of the doorway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he supposed to be a gleeman or a king?&rdquo; Cenn Buie asked in
annoyed tones. &ldquo;A waste of good money, if you ask me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bran al&rsquo;Vere half turned after the gleeman then shook his head.
&ldquo;That man may be more trouble than he&rsquo;s worth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve, busy gathering her cloak around her, sniffed loudly.
&ldquo;Worry about the gleeman if you want, Brandelwyn al&rsquo;Vere. At least
he is in Emond&rsquo;s Field, which is more than you can say for this
false Dragon. But as long as you are worrying, there are others
here who <em>should</em> excite your worry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please, Wisdom,&rdquo; Bran said stiffly, &ldquo;kindly leave who
should worry me to my deciding. Mistress Moiraine and Master Lan
are guests in my inn, and decent, respectable folk, so I say.
Neither of <em>them</em> has called me a fool in front of the whole Council.
Neither of <em>them</em> has told the Council it hasn&rsquo;t a full set of wits
among them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems my estimate was too high by half,&rdquo; Nynaeve retorted.
She strode away without a backward glance, leaving Bran&rsquo;s jaw
working as he searched for a reply.</p>

<p>Egwene looked at Rand as if she were going to speak, then darted
after the Wisdom instead. Rand knew there must be some way to stop
her from leaving the Two Rivers, but the only way he could think of
was not one he was prepared to take, even if she was willing. And
she had as much as said she was not willing at all, which made him
feel even worse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That young woman wants a husband,&rdquo; Cenn Buie growled, bouncing
on his toes. His face was purple, and getting darker. &ldquo;She lacks
proper respect. We&rsquo;re the Village Council, not boys raking her
yard, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Mayor breathed heavily through his nose, and suddenly
rounded on the old thatcher. &ldquo;Be quiet, Cenn! Stop acting like a
black-veiled Aiel!&rdquo; The skinny man froze on his toes in
astonishment. The Mayor never let his temper get the best of him.
Bran glared. &ldquo;Burn me, but we have better things to be about than
this foolishness. Or do you intend to prove Nynaeve right?&rdquo; With
that he stumped back into the inn and slammed the door behind
him.</p>

<p>The Council members glanced at Cenn, then moved off in their
separate directions. All but Haral Luhhan, who accompanied the
stony-visaged thatcher, talking quietly. The blacksmith was the
only one who could ever get Cenn to see reason.</p>

<p>Rand went to meet his father, and his friends trailed after
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen Master al&rsquo;Vere so mad,&rdquo; was the first thing
Rand said, getting him a disgusted look from Mat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Mayor and the Wisdom seldom agree,&rdquo; Tam said, &ldquo;and they
agreed less than usual today. That&rsquo;s all. It&rsquo;s the same in every
village.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about the false Dragon?&rdquo; Mat asked, and Perrin added eager
murmurs. &ldquo;What about the Aes Sedai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tam shook his head slowly. &ldquo;Master Fain knew little more than he
had already told. At least, little of interest to us. Battles won
or lost. Cities taken and retaken. All in Ghealdan, thank the
Light. It hasn&rsquo;t spread, or had not the last Master Fain knew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Battles interest me,&rdquo; Mat said, and Perrin added, &ldquo;What did he
say about them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Battles don&rsquo;t interest me, Matrim,&rdquo; Tam said. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m sure he
will be glad to tell you all about them later. What does interest
me is that we shouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about them here, as far as
the Council can tell. We can see no reason for Aes Sedai to come
here on their way south. And as for the return journey, they aren&rsquo;t
likely to want to cross the Forest of Shadows and swim the White
River.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand and the others chuckled at the idea. There were three
reasons why no one came into the Two Rivers except from the north,
by way of Taren Ferry. The Mountains of Mist, in the west, were the
first, of course, and the Mire blocked the east just as
effectively. To the south was the White River, which got its name
from the way rocks and boulders churned its swift waters to froth.
And beyond the White lay the Forest of Shadows. Few Two Rivers folk
had ever crossed the White, and fewer still returned if they did.
It was generally agreed, though, that the Forest of Shadows
stretched south for a hundred miles or more without a road or a
village, but with plenty of wolves and bears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s an end to it for us,&rdquo; Mat said. He sounded at least a
little disappointed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; Tam said. &ldquo;Day after tomorrow we will send men to
Deven Ride and Watch Hill, and Taren Ferry, too, to arrange for a
watch to be kept. Riders along the White and the Taren, both, and
patrols between. It should be done today, but only the Mayor agrees
with me. The rest can&rsquo;t see asking anyone to spend Bel Tine off
riding across the Two Rivers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I thought you said we didn&rsquo;t have to worry,&rdquo; Perrin said,
and Tam shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said should not, boy, not did not. I&rsquo;ve seen men die because
they were sure that what should not happen, would not. Besides, the
fighting will stir up all sorts of people. Most will just be trying
to find safety, but others will be looking for a way to profit from
the confusion. We&rsquo;ll offer any of the first a helping hand, but we
must be ready to send the second type on their way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly Mat spoke up. &ldquo;Can we be part of it? I want to, anyway.
You know I can ride as well as anyone in the village.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want a few weeks of cold, boredom, and sleeping rough?&rdquo; Tam
chuckled. &ldquo;Likely that&rsquo;s all there will be to it. I hope that&rsquo;s
all. We&rsquo;re well out of the way even for refugees. But you can speak
to Master al&rsquo;Vere if your mind is made up. Rand, it&rsquo;s time for us
to be getting back to the farm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand blinked in surprise. &ldquo;I thought we were staying for
Winternight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Things need seeing to at the farm, and I need you with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even so, we don&rsquo;t have to leave for hours yet. And I want to
volunteer for the patrols, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are going now,&rdquo; his father replied in a tone that brooked no
argument. In a softer voice he added, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back tomorrow in
plenty of time for you to speak to the Mayor. And plenty of time
for Festival, too. Five minutes, now, then meet me in the
stable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to join Rand and me on the watch?&rdquo; Mat asked
Perrin as Tam left. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet there&rsquo;s nothing like this ever
happened in the Two Rivers before. Why, if we get up to the Taren,
we might even see soldiers, or who knows what. Even Tinkers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I expect I will,&rdquo; &rsquo;Perrin said slowly, &ldquo;if Master Luhhan
doesn&rsquo;t need me, that is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The war is in Ghealdan,&rdquo; Rand snapped. With an effort he
lowered his voice. &ldquo;The war is in Ghealdan, and the Aes Sedai are
the Light knows where, but none of it is here. The man in the black
cloak is, or have you forgotten him already?&rdquo; The others exchanged
embarrassed looks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry, Rand,&rdquo; Mat muttered. &ldquo;But a chance to do something
besides milk my da&rsquo;s cows doesn&rsquo;t come along very often.&rdquo; He
straightened under their startled stares. &ldquo;Well, I do milk them,
and every day, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The black rider,&rdquo; Rand reminded them. &ldquo;What if he hurts
somebody?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s a refugee from the war,&rdquo; Perrin said doubtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever he is,&rdquo; Mat said, &ldquo;the watch will find him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Rand said, &ldquo;but he seems to disappear when he wants to.
It might be better if they knew to look for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll tell Master al&rsquo;Vere when we volunteer for the patrols,&rdquo;
Mat said, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll tell the Council, and they&rsquo;ll tell the watch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Council!&rdquo; Perrin said incredulously. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d be lucky if the
Mayor didn&rsquo;t laugh out loud. Master Luhhan and Rand&rsquo;s father
already think the two of us are jumping at shadows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand sighed. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re going to do it, we might as well do it
now. He won&rsquo;t laugh any louder today than he will tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Perrin said with a sidelong glance at Mat, &ldquo;we should
try finding some others who&rsquo;ve seen him. We&rsquo;ll see just about
everybody in the village tonight.&rdquo; Mat&rsquo;s scowl deepened, but he
still did not say anything. All of them understood that Perrin
meant they should find witnesses who were more reliable than Mat.
&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t laugh any louder tomorrow,&rdquo; Perrin added when Rand
hesitated. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;d just as soon have somebody else with us when we
go to him. Half the village would suit me fine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand nodded slowly. He could already hear Master al&rsquo;Vere
laughing. More witnesses certainly could not hurt. And if three of
them had seen the fellow, others had to have, too. They must have.
&ldquo;Tomorrow, then. You two find whoever you can tonight, and tomorrow
we go to the Mayor. After that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; They looked at him silently,
no one raising the question of what happened if they could not find
anyone else who had seen the black-cloaked man. The question was
clear in their eyes, though, and he had no answer. He sighed
heavily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better go, now. My father will be wondering if I fell
into a hole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Followed by their goodbyes, he trotted around to the stable yard
where the high-wheeled cart stood propped on its shafts.</p>

<p>The stable was a long, narrow building, topped by a high peaked,
thatched roof. Stalls, their floors covered with straw, filled both
sides of the dim interior, lit only by the open double doors at
either end. The peddler&rsquo;s team munched their oats in eight stalls,
and Master al&rsquo;Vere&rsquo;s massive Dhurrans, the team he hired out when
farmers had hauling beyond the abilities of their own horses,
filled six more, but only three others were occupied. Rand thought
he could match up horse and rider with no trouble. The tall,
deep-chested black stallion that swung up his head fiercely had to
be Lan&rsquo;s. The sleek white mare with an arched neck, her quick steps
as graceful as a girl dancing, even in the stall, could only belong
to Moiraine. And the third unfamiliar horse, a rangy, slab-sided
gelding of a dusty brown, fit Thom Merrilin perfectly.</p>

<p>Tam stood in the rear of the stable, holding Bela by a lead rope
and speaking quietly to Hu and Tad. Before Rand had taken two steps
into the stable his father nodded to the stablemen and brought Bela
out, wordlessly gathering up Rand as he went.</p>

<p>They harnessed the shaggy mare in silence. Tam appeared so deep
in thought that Rand held his tongue. He did not really look
forward to trying to convince his father about the black-cloaked
rider, much less the Mayor. Tomorrow would have to be time enough,
when Mat and the rest had found others who had seen the man. If
they found others.</p>

<p>As the cart lurched into motion, Rand took his bow and quiver
from the back, awkwardly belting the quiver at his waist as he half
trotted alongside. When they reached the last row of houses in the
village, he nocked an arrow, carrying it half raised and partly
drawn. There was nothing to see except mostly leafless trees, but
his shoulders tightened. The black rider could be on them before
either of them knew it. There might not be time to draw the bow if
he was not already halfway to it.</p>

<p>He knew he could not keep up the tension on the bowstring for
long. He had made the bow himself, and Tam was one of the few
others in the district who could even draw it all the way to the
cheek. He cast around for something to take his mind off thinking
about the dark rider. Surrounded by the forest, their cloaks
flapping in the wind, it was not easy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; he said finally, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand why the Council
had to question Padan Fain.&rdquo; With an effort he took his eyes off
the woods and looked across Bela at Tam. &ldquo;It seems to me, the
decision you reached could have been made right on the spot. The
Mayor frightened everybody half out of their wits, talking about
Aes Sedai and the false Dragon here in the Two Rivers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;People are funny, Rand. The best of them are. Take Haral
Luhhan. Master Luhhan is a strong man, and a brave one, but he
can&rsquo;t bear to see butchering done. Turns pale as a sheet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does that have to do with anything? Everybody knows Master
Luhhan can&rsquo;t stand the sight of blood, and nobody but the Coplins
and the Congars thinks anything of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just this, lad. People don&rsquo;t always think or behave the way you
might believe they would. Those folk back there&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;let the hail
beat their crops into the mud, and the wind take off every roof in
the district, and the wolves kill half their livestock, and they&rsquo;ll
roll up their sleeves and start from scratch. They&rsquo;ll grumble, but
they won&rsquo;t waste any time with it. But you give them just the
thought of Aes Sedai and a false Dragon in Ghealdan, and soon
enough they&rsquo;ll start thinking that Ghealdan is not that far the
other side of the Forest of Shadows, and a straight line from Tar
Valon to Ghealdan wouldn&rsquo;t pass that much to the east of us. As if
the Aes Sedai wouldn&rsquo;t take the road through Caemlyn and Lugard
instead of traveling cross-country! By tomorrow morning half the
village would have been sure the entire war was about to descend on
us. It would take weeks to undo. A fine Bel Tine that would make.
So Bran gave them the idea before they could get it for
themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve seen the Council take the problem under consideration,
and by now they&rsquo;ll be hearing what we decided. They chose us for
the Village Council because they trust we can reason things out in
the best way for everybody. They trust our opinions. Even Cenn&rsquo;s,
which doesn&rsquo;t say much for the rest of us, I suppose. At any rate,
they will hear there isn&rsquo;t anything to worry about, and they&rsquo;ll
believe it. It is not that they couldn&rsquo;t reach the same conclusion,
or would not, eventually, but this way we won&rsquo;t have Festival
ruined, and nobody has to spend weeks worrying about something that
isn&rsquo;t likely to happen. If it does, against all odds&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well,
the patrols will give us enough warning to do what we can. I truly
don&rsquo;t think it will come to that, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand puffed out his cheeks. Apparently, being on the Council was
more complicated than he had believed. The cart rumbled on along
the Quarry Road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did anyone besides Perrin see this strange rider?&rdquo; Tam
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat did, but&mdash;&rdquo; Rand blinked, then stared across Bela&rsquo;s
back at his father. &ldquo;You believe me? I have to go back. I have to
tell them.&rdquo; Tam&rsquo;s shout halted him as he turned to run back to the
village.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold, lad, hold! Do you think I waited this long to speak for
no reason?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reluctantly Rand kept on beside the cart, still creaking along
behind patient Bela. &ldquo;What made you change your mind? Why can&rsquo;t I
tell the others?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll know soon enough. At least, Perrin will. Mat, I&rsquo;m not
sure of. Word must be gotten to the farms as best it can, but in
another hour there won&rsquo;t be anyone in Emond&rsquo;s Field above sixteen,
those who can be responsible about it, at least, who doesn&rsquo;t know a
stranger is skulking around and likely not the sort you would
invite to Festival. The winter has been bad enough without this to
scare the young ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Festival?&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;If you had seen him you wouldn&rsquo;t want
him closer than ten miles. A hundred, maybe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; Tam said placidly. &ldquo;He could be just a refugee
from the troubles in Ghealdan, or more likely a thief who thinks
the pickings will be easier here than in Baerlon or Taren Ferry.
Even so, no one around here has so much they can afford to have it
stolen. If the man is trying to escape the war&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well, that&rsquo;s
still no excuse for scaring people. Once the watch is mounted, it
should either find him or frighten him off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope it frightens him off. But why do you believe me now,
when you didn&rsquo;t this morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had to believe my own eyes then, lad, and I saw nothing.&rdquo; Tam
shook his grizzled head. &ldquo;Only young men see this fellow, it seems.
When Haral Luhhan mentioned Perrin jumping at shadows, though, it all
came out. Jon Thane&rsquo;s oldest son saw him, too, and so did Samel
Crawe&rsquo;s boy, Bandry. Well, when four of you say you&rsquo;ve seen a thing&mdash;and solid lads, all&mdash;we start thinking maybe it&rsquo;s
there whether we can see it or not. All except Cenn, of course.
Anyway, that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re going home. With both of us away, this
stranger could be up to any kind of mischief there. If not for
Festival, I wouldn&rsquo;t come back tomorrow, either. But we can&rsquo;t make
ourselves prisoners in our own homes just because this fellow is
lurking about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know about Ban or Lem,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;The rest of us
were going to the Mayor tomorrow, but we were worried he wouldn&rsquo;t
believe us, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gray hairs don&rsquo;t mean our brains have curdled,&rdquo; Tam said dryly.
&ldquo;So you keep a sharp eye. Maybe I&rsquo;ll catch sight of him, too, if he
shows up again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand settled down to do just that. He was surprised to realize
that his step felt lighter. The knots were gone from his shoulders.
He was still scared, but it was not so bad as it had been. Tam and
he were just as alone on the Quarry Road as they had been that
morning, but in some way he felt as if the entire village were with
them. That others knew and believed made all the difference. There
was nothing the black-cloaked horseman could do that the people of
Emond&rsquo;s Field could not handle together.</p>
