<h4><em>The Road to Taren Ferry</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">O</span>n
the hard-packed dirt of the North Road the horses stretched
out, manes and tails streaming back in the moonlight as they raced
northward, hooves pounding a steady rhythm. Lan led the way, black
horse and shadow-clad rider all but invisible in the cold night.
Moiraine&rsquo;s white mare, matching the stallion stride for stride, was
a pale dart speeding through the dark. The rest followed in a tight
line, as if they were all tied to a rope with one end in the
Warder&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<p>Rand galloped last in line, with Thom Merrilin just ahead and
the others less distinct beyond. The gleeman never turned his head,
reserving his eyes for where they ran, not what they ran from. If
Trollocs appeared behind, or the Fade on its silent horse, or that
flying creature, the Draghkar, it would be up to Rand to sound an
alarm.</p>

<p>Every few minutes he craned his neck to peer behind while he
clung to Cloud&rsquo;s mane and reins. The Draghkar&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Worse than
Trollocs and Fades, Thom had said. But the sky was empty, and only
darkness and shadows met his eyes on the ground. Shadows that could
hide an army.</p>

<p>Now that the gray had been let loose to run, the animal sped
through the night like a ghost, easily keeping pace with Lan&rsquo;s
stallion. And Cloud wanted to go faster. He wanted to catch the
black, strained to catch the black. Rand had to keep a firm hand on
the reins to hold him back. Cloud lunged against his restraint as
if the gray thought this were a race, fighting him for mastery with
every stride. Rand clung to saddle and reins with every muscle
taut. Fervently he hoped his mount did not detect how uneasy he
was. If Cloud did, he would lose the one real edge he held, however
precariously.</p>

<p>Lying low on Cloud&rsquo;s neck, Rand kept a worried eye on Bela and
on her rider. When he had said the shaggy mare could stay with the
others, he had not meant on the run. She kept up now only by
running as he had not thought she could. Lan had not wanted Egwene
in their number. Would he slow for her if Bela began to flag? Or
would he try to leave her behind? The Aes Sedai and the Warder
thought Rand and his friends were important in some way, but for
all of Moiraine&rsquo;s talk of the Pattern, he did not think they
included Egwene in that importance.</p>

<p>If Bela fell back, he would fall back, too, whatever Moiraine
and Lan had to say about it. Back where the Fade and the Trollocs
were. Back where the Draghkar was. With all his heart and
desperation he silently shouted at Bela to run like the wind,
silently tried to will strength into her. <em>Run!</em> His skin prickled,
and his bones felt as if they were freezing, ready to split open.
<em>The Light help her, run!</em> And Bela ran.</p>

<p>On and on they sped, northward into the night, time fading into
an indistinct blur. Now and again the lights of farmhouses flashed
into sight, then disappeared as quickly as imagination. Dogs&rsquo; sharp
challenges faded swiftly behind, or cut off abruptly as the dogs
decided they had been chased away. They raced through darkness
relieved only by watery pale moonlight, a darkness where trees
along the road loomed up without warning, then were gone. For the
rest, murk surrounded them, and only a solitary night-bird&rsquo;s cry,
lonely and mournful, disturbed the steady pounding of hooves.</p>

<p>Abruptly Lan slowed, then brought the file of horses to a stop.
Rand was not sure how long they had been moving, but a soft ache
filled his legs from gripping the saddle. Ahead of them in the
night, lights sparkled, as if a tall swarm of fireflies held one
place among the trees.</p>

<p>Rand frowned at the lights in puzzlement, then suddenly gasped
with surprise. The fireflies were windows, the windows of houses
covering the sides and top of a hill. It was Watch Hill. He could
hardly believe they had come so far. They had probably made the
journey as fast as it had ever been traveled. Following Lan&rsquo;s
example, Rand and Thom Merrilin dismounted. Cloud stood head down,
sides heaving. Lather, almost indistinguishable from the horse&rsquo;s smoky sides,
flecked the gray&rsquo;s neck and shoulders. Rand thought that Cloud
would not be carrying anyone further that night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much as I would like to put all these villages behind me,&rdquo; Thom
announced, &ldquo;a few hours rest would not go amiss right now. Surely
we have enough of a lead to allow that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stretched, knuckling the small of his back. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re
stopping the rest of the night in Watch Hill, we may as well go on
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A vagrant gust of wind brought a fragment of song from the
village, and smells of cooking that made his mouth water. They were
still celebrating in Watch Hill. There had been no Trollocs to
disturb their Bel Tine. He looked for Egwene. She was leaning
against Bela, slumped with weariness. The others were climbing down
as well, with many a sigh and much stretching of aching muscles.
Only the Warder and the Aes Sedai showed no visible sign of
fatigue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could do with some singing,&rdquo; Mat put in tiredly. &ldquo;And maybe a
hot mutton pie at the White Boar.&rdquo; Pausing, he added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never
been further than Watch Hill. The White Boar&rsquo;s not nearly as good
as the Winespring Inn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The White Boar isn&rsquo;t so bad,&rdquo; Perrin said. &ldquo;A mutton pie for
me, too. And lots of hot tea to take the chill off my bones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We cannot stop until we are across the Taren,&rdquo; Lan said
sharply. &ldquo;Not for more than a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the horses,&rdquo; Rand protested. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll run them to death, we
try to go any further tonight. Moiraine Sedai, surely you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had vaguely noticed her moving among the horses, but he had
not paid any real attention to what she did. Now she pushed past
him to lay her hands on Cloud&rsquo;s neck. Rand fell silent. Suddenly
the horse tossed his head with a soft wicker, nearly pulling the
reins from Rand&rsquo;s hands. The gray danced a step sideways, as
restive as if he had spent a week in a stable. Without a word
Moiraine went to Bela.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not know she could do that,&rdquo; Rand said softly to Lan, his
cheeks hot.</p>

<p>&rsquo;You, of all people, should have suspected it,&rdquo; the Warder
replied. &ldquo;You watched her with your father. She will wash all the
fatigue away. First from the horses, then from the rest of
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The rest of us. Not you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not me, sheepherder. I don&rsquo;t need it, not yet. And not her.
What she can do for others, she cannot do for herself. Only one of
us will ride tired. You had better hope she does not grow too tired
before we reach Tar Valon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too tired for what?&rdquo; Rand asked the Warder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were right about your Bela, Rand,&rdquo; Moiraine said from where
she stood by the mare. &ldquo;She has a good heart, and as much
stubbornness as the rest of you Two Rivers folk. Strange as it
seems, she may be the least weary of all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A scream ripped the darkness, a sound like a man dying under
sharp knives, and wings swooped low above the party. The night
deepened in the shadow that swept over them. With panicked cries
the horses reared wildly.</p>

<p>The wind of the Draghkar&rsquo;s wings beat at Rand with a feel like
the touch of slime, like chittering in the dank dimness of a
nightmare. He had no time even to feel the fear of it, for Cloud
exploded into the air with a scream of his own, twisting
desperately as if attempting to shake off some clinging thing.
Rand, hanging onto the reins, was jerked off his feet and dragged
across the ground, Cloud screaming as though the big gray felt
wolves tearing at his hocks.</p>

<p>Somehow he maintained his grip on the reins; using the other
hand as much as his legs he scrambled onto his feet, taking
leaping, staggering steps to keep from being pulled down again. His
breath came in ragged pants of desperation. He could not let Cloud
get away. He threw out a frantic hand, barely catching the bridle.
Cloud reared, lifting him into the air; Rand clung helplessly,
hoping against hope that the horse would quieten.</p>

<p>The shock of landing jarred Rand to his teeth, but suddenly the
gray was still, nostrils flaring and eyes rolling, stiff-legged and
trembling. Rand was trembling as well, and all but hanging from the
bridle. <em>That jolt must have shaken the fool animal, too</em>, he
thought. He took three or four deep, shaky breaths. Only then could
he look around and see what had happened to the others.</p>

<p>Chaos reigned among the party. They clutched reins against
jerking heads, trying with little success to calm the rearing
horses that dragged them about in a milling mass. Only two
seemingly had no trouble at all with their mounts. Moiraine sat
straight in her saddle, the white mare stepping delicately away
from the confusion as if nothing at all out of the ordinary had
happened. On foot, Lan scanned the sky, sword in one hand and reins
in the other; the sleek black stallion stood quietly beside
him.</p>

<p>Sounds of merrymaking no longer came from Watch Hill. Those in
the village must have heard the cry, too. Rand knew they would
listen awhile, and perhaps watch for what had caused it, then
return to their jollity. They would soon forget the incident, its
memory submerged by song and food and dance and fun. Perhaps when
they heard the news of what had happened in Emond&rsquo;s Field some
would remember, and wonder. A fiddle began to play, and after a
moment a flute joined in. The village was resuming its
celebration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mount!&rdquo; Lan commanded curtly. Sheathing his sword, he leaped
onto the stallion. &ldquo;The Draghkar would not have showed itself
unless it had already reported our whereabouts to the Myrddraal.&rdquo;
Another strident shriek drifted down from far above, fainter but no
less harsh. The music from Watch Hill silenced raggedly once more.
&ldquo;It tracks us now, marking us for the Halfman. He won&rsquo;t be
far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The horses, fresh now as well as fear-struck, pranced and backed
away from those trying to mount. A cursing Thom Merrilin was the
first into his saddle, but the others were up soon after. All but
one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry, Rand!&rdquo; Egwene shouted. The Draghkar gave shrill voice
once more, and Bela ran a few steps before she could rein the mare
in. &ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a start Rand realized that instead of trying to mount Cloud
he had been standing there staring at the sky in a vain attempt to
locate the source of those vile shrieks. More, all unaware, he had
drawn Tam&rsquo;s sword as if to fight the flying thing.</p>

<p>His face reddened, making him glad for the night to hide him.
Awkwardly, with one hand occupied by the reins, he resheathed the
blade, glancing hastily at the others. Moiraine, Lan, and Egwene
all were looking at him, though he could not be sure how much they
could see in the moonlight. The rest seemed too absorbed with
keeping their horses under control to pay him any mind. He put a
hand on the pommel and reached the saddle in one leap, as if he had
been doing the like all his life. If any of his friends had noticed
the sword, he would surely hear about it later. There would be time
enough to worry about it then.</p>

<p>As soon as he was in the saddle they were all off at a gallop
again, up the road and by the dome-like hill. Dogs barked in the
village; their passage was not entirely unnoticed. <em>Or maybe the
dogs smelled Trollocs</em>, Rand thought. The barking and the village
lights alike vanished quickly behind them.</p>

<p>They galloped in a knot, horses all but jostling together as
they ran. Lan ordered them to spread out again, but no one wanted
to be even a little alone in the night. A scream came from high
overhead. The Warder gave up and let them run clustered.</p>

<p>Rand was close behind Moiraine and Lan, the gray straining in an
effort to force himself between the Warder&rsquo;s black and the Aes
Sedai&rsquo;s trim mare. Egwene and the gleeman raced on either flank of
him, while Rand&rsquo;s friends crowded in behind. Cloud, spurred by the
Draghkar&rsquo;s cries, ran beyond anything Rand could do to slow him
even had he wished to, yet the gray could not gain so much as a
step on the other two horses.</p>

<p>The Draghkar&rsquo;s shriek challenged the night.</p>

<p>Stout Bela ran with
neck outstretched and tail and mane streaming in the wind of her
running, matching the larger horses&rsquo; every stride. <em>The Aes Sedai
must have done something more than simply ridding her of
fatigue</em>.</p>

<p>Egwene&rsquo;s face in the moonlight was smiling in excited delight.
Her braid streamed behind like the horses&rsquo; manes, and the gleam in
her eyes was not all from the moon, Rand was sure. His mouth
dropped open in surprise, until a swallowed biteme set him off into
a fit of coughing.</p>

<p>Lan must have asked a question, for Moiraine suddenly shouted,
over the wind and the pounding of hooves. &ldquo;I cannot! Most
especially not from the back of a galloping horse. They are not
easily killed, even when they can be seen. We must run, and
hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They galloped through a tatter of fog, thin and no higher than
the horses&rsquo; knees. Cloud sped through it in two strides, and Rand
blinked, wondering if he had imagined it. Surely the night was too
cold for fog. Another patch of ragged gray whisked by them to one
side, larger than the first. It had been growing, as if the mist
oozed from the ground. Above them, the Draghkar screamed in rage.
Fog enveloped the riders for a brief moment and was gone, came
again and vanished behind. The icy mist left a chill dampness on Rand&rsquo;s face and hands.
Then a wall of pale gray loomed before them, and they were suddenly
enshrouded. The thickness of it muffled the sound of their hooves
to dullness, and the cries from overhead seemed to come through a
wall. Rand could only just make out the shapes of Egwene and Thom
Merrilin on either side of him.</p>

<p>Lan did not slow their pace. &ldquo;There is still only one place we
can be going,&rdquo; he called, his voice sounding hollow and
directionless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Myrddraal are sly,&rdquo; Moiraine replied. &ldquo;I will use its own
slyness against it.&rdquo; They galloped on silently.</p>

<p>Slaty mist obscured both sky and ground, so that the riders,
themselves turned to shadow, appeared to float through night
clouds. Even the legs of their own horses seemed to have
vanished.</p>

<p>Rand shifted in his saddle, shrinking away from the icy fog.
Knowing that Moiraine could do things, even seeing her do them, was
one thing; having those things leave his skin damp was something
else again. He realized he was holding his breath, too, and called
himself nine kinds of idiot. He could not ride all the way to Taren
Ferry without breathing. She had used the One Power on Tam, and he
seemed all right. Still, he had to make himself let that breath go
and inhale. The air was heavy, but if colder it was otherwise no
different than that on any other foggy night. He told himself that,
but he was not sure he believed it.</p>

<p>Lan encouraged them to keep close now, to stay where each could
see the outlines of others in that damp, frosty grayness. Yet the
Warder still did not slacken his stallion&rsquo;s dead run. Side by side,
Lan and Moiraine led the way through the fog as if they could see
clearly what lay ahead. The rest could only trust and follow. And
hope.</p>

<p>The shrill cries that had hounded them faded as they galloped,
and then were gone, but that gave small comfort. Forest and
farmhouses, moon and road were shrouded and hidden. Dogs still
barked, hollow and distant in the gray haze, when they passed
farms, but there was no other sound save the dull drumming of their
horses&rsquo; hooves. Nothing in that featureless ashen fog changed.
Nothing gave any hint of the passage of time except the growing
ache in thigh and back.</p>

<p>It had to have been hours, Rand was sure. His hands had clutched
his reins until he was not sure he could release them, and he
wondered if he would ever walk properly again. He glanced back only
once. Shadows in the fog raced behind him, but he could not even be
certain of their number. Or even that they really were his friends.
The chill and damp soaked through his cloak and coat and shirt,
soaked into his bones, so it seemed. Only the rush of air past his
face and the gather and stretch of the horse beneath him told him
he was moving at all. It must have been hours.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slow,&rdquo; Lan called suddenly. &ldquo;Draw rein.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand was so startled
that Cloud forced between Lan and Moiraine, forging ahead for half
a dozen strides before he could pull the big gray to a halt and
stare.</p>

<p>Houses loomed in the fog on all sides, houses strangely tall
to Rand&rsquo;s eye. He had never seen this place before, but he had
often heard descriptions. That tallness came from high redstone
foundations, necessary when the spring melt in the Mountains of
Mist made the Taren overflow its banks. They had reached Taren
Ferry.</p>

<p>Lan trotted the black warhorse past him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so eager,
sheepherder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Discomfited, Rand fell into place without explaining as the
party moved deeper into the village. His face was hot, and for the
moment the fog was welcome.</p>

<p>A lone dog, unseen in the cold mist,
barked at them furiously, then ran away. Here and there a light
appeared in a window as some early-riser stirred. Other than the
dog, no sound save the muted clops of their horses&rsquo; hooves
disturbed the last hour of the night.</p>

<p>Rand had met few people from Taren Ferry. He tried to recall
what little he knew about them. They seldom ventured down into what
they called &ldquo;the lower villages,&rdquo; with their noses up as if they
smelled something bad. The few he had met bore strange names, like
Hilltop and Stoneboat. One and all, Taren Ferry folk had a
reputation for slyness and trickery. If you shook hands with a
Taren Ferry man, people said, you counted your fingers
afterwards.</p>

<p>Lan and Moiraine stopped before a tall, dark house that looked
exactly like any other in the village. Fog swirled around the
Warder like smoke as he leaped from his saddle and mounted the
stairs that rose to the front door, as high above the street as
their heads. At the top of the stairs Lan hammered with his fist on
the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought he wanted quiet,&rdquo; Mat muttered.</p>

<p>Lan&rsquo;s pounding went
on. A light appeared in the window of the next house, and someone
shouted angrily, but the Warder kept on with his drumming.</p>

<p>Abruptly the door was flung back by a man in a nightshirt that
flapped about his bare ankles. An oil lamp in one hand illumined a
narrow face with pointed features. He opened his mouth angrily,
then let it stay open as his head swiveled to take in the fog, eyes
bulging. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; Chill gray tendrils
curled into the doorway, and he hurriedly stepped back away from
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Hightower,&rdquo; Lan said. &ldquo;Just the man I need. We want to
cross over on your ferry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He never even saw a high tower,&rdquo; Mat snickered. Rand made
shushing motions at his friend. The sharp-faced fellow raised his
lamp higher and peered down at them suspiciously.</p>

<p>After a minute Master Hightower said crossly, &ldquo;The ferry goes
over in daylight. Not in the night. Not ever. And not in this fog,
neither. Come back when the sun&rsquo;s up and the fog&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He started to turn away; but Lan caught his wrist. The ferryman
opened his mouth angrily. Gold glinted in the lamplight as the
Warder counted out coins one by one into the other&rsquo;s palm.
Hightower licked his lips as the coins clinked, and by inches his
head moved closer to his hand, as if he could not believe what he
was seeing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And as much again,&rdquo; Lan said, &ldquo;when we are safely on the other
side. But we leave now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now?&rdquo; Chewing his lower lip, the ferrety man shifted his feet
and peered out at the mist-laden night, then nodded abruptly. &ldquo;Now
it is. Well, let loose my wrist. I have to rouse my haulers. You
don&rsquo;t think I pull the ferry across myself, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will wait at the ferry,&rdquo; Lan said flatly. &ldquo;For a little
while.&rdquo; He released his hold on the ferryman.</p>

<p>Master Hightower jerked the handful of coins to his chest and,
nodding agreement, hastily shoved the door closed with his hip.</p>
