streaming across his narrow bed finally woke Rand out
of a deep but restless sleep. He pulled a pillow over his head, but

a sack.</p>

<p>Taking the stairs two at a time, he hurried down to the kitchen.
That was surely the quickest place to get a bite, and on his only
day in Baerlon he did not want to waste any more time than he
already had. <em>Blood and ashes, but
