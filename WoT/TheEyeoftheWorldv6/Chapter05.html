<h4><em>Winternight</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
sun stood halfway down from its noonday high by the time the
cart reached the farmhouse. It was not a big house, not nearly so
large as some of the sprawling farmhouses to the east, dwellings
that had grown over the years to hold entire families. In the Two
Rivers, that often included three or four generations under one
roof, including aunts, uncles, cousins, and nephews. Tam and Rand
were considered out of the ordinary as much for being two men
living alone as for farming in the Westwood.</p>

<p>Here most of the rooms were on one floor, a neat rectangle with
no wings or additions. Two bedrooms and an attic storeroom fitted
up under the steeply sloped thatch. If the whitewash was all but
gone from the stout wooden walls after the winter storms, the house
was still in a tidy state of repair, the thatch tightly mended and
the doors and shutters well-hung and snug fitting.</p>

<p>House, barn, and stone sheep pen formed the points of a triangle
around the farmyard, where a few chickens had ventured out to
scratch at the cold ground. An open shearing shed and a
stone-dipping trough stood next to the sheep pen. Hard by the
fields between the farmyard and the trees loomed the tall cone of a
tight-walled curing shed. Few farmers in the Two Rivers could make
do without both wool and tabac to sell when the merchants came.</p>

<p>When Rand took a look in the stone pen, the heavy-horned herd ram
looked back at him, but most of the black-faced flock remained
placidly where they lay, or stood with their heads in the feed
trough. Their coats were thick and curly, but it was still too cold
for shearing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the black-cloaked man came here,&rdquo; Rand called to
his father, who was walking slowly around the farmhouse, spear held
at the ready, examining the ground intently. &ldquo;The sheep wouldn&rsquo;t be
so settled if that one had been around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tam nodded but did not stop. When he had made a complete circuit of
the house, he did the same around the barn and the sheep pen, still
studying the ground. He even checked the smokehouse and the curing
shed. Drawing a bucket of water from the well, he filled a cupped
hand, sniffed the water, and gingerly touched it with the tip of
his tongue. Abruptly he barked a laugh, then drank it down in a
quick gulp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose he didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he told Rand, wiping his hand on his coat
front. &ldquo;All this about men and horses I can&rsquo;t see or hear just
makes me look crossways at everything.&rdquo; He emptied the well water into
another bucket and started for
the house, the bucket in one hand and his spear in the other.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll start some stew for supper. And as long as were here, we
might as well get caught up on a few chores.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand grimaced, regretting Winternight in Emond&rsquo;s Field. But Tam
was right. Around a farm the work never really got done; as soon as
one thing was finished two more always needed doing. He hesitated
about it, but kept his bow and quiver close at hand. If the dark
rider did appear, he had no intention of facing him with nothing
but a hoe.</p>

<p>First was stabling Bela. Once he had unharnessed her and put her
into a stall in the barn next to their cow, he set his cloak aside
and rubbed the mare down with handfuls of dry straw, then curried
her with a pair of brushes. Climbing the narrow ladder to the
loft, he pitched down hay for her feed. He fetched a scoopful of
oats for her as well, though there was little enough left and might
be no more for a long while unless the weather warmed soon. The cow
had been milked that morning before first light, giving a quarter
of her usual yield; she seemed to be drying up as the winter hung
on.</p>

<p>Enough feed had been left to see the sheep for two days&mdash;they should have been in the pasture by now, but there was none
worth calling it so&mdash;but he topped off their water. Whatever
eggs had been laid needed to be gathered, too. There were only
three. The hens seemed to be getting cleverer at hiding them.</p>

<p>He was taking a hoe to the vegetable garden behind the house
when Tam came out and settled on a bench in front of the barn to
mend harness, propping his spear beside him. It made Rand feel
better about the bow lying on his cloak a pace from where he
stood.</p>

<p>Few weeds had pushed above ground, but more weeds than anything
else. The cabbages were stunted; barely a sprout of the beans or
peas showed, and there was not a sign of a beet. Not everything had
been planted, of course; only part, in hopes the cold might break
in time to make a crop of some kind before the cellar was empty. It
did not take long to finish hoeing, which would have suited him
just fine in years past, but now he wondered what they would do if
nothing came up this year. Not a pleasant thought. And there was
still firewood to split.</p>

<p>It seemed to Rand like years since there had not been firewood
to split. But complaining would not keep the house warm, so he
fetched the axe, propped up bow and quiver beside the chopping
block, and got to work. Pine for a quick, hot flame, and oak for
long burning. Before long he was warm enough to put his coat aside.
When the pile of split wood grew big enough, he stacked it against
the side of the house, beside other stacks already there. Most
reached all the way to the eaves. Usually by this time of year the
woodpiles were small and few, but not this year. Chop and stack,
chop and stack, he lost himself in the rhythm of the axe and the
motions of stacking wood. Tam&rsquo;s hand on his shoulder brought him
back to where he was, and for a moment he blinked in surprise.</p>

<p>Gray twilight had come on while he worked, and already it was
fading quickly toward night. The full moon stood well above the
treetops, shimmering pale and bulging as if about to fall on their
heads. The wind had grown colder without his noticing, too, and
tattered clouds scudded across the darkling sky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wash up, lad, and see about some supper. I&rsquo;ve already
carried in water for hot baths before sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything hot sounds good to me,&rdquo; Rand said, snatching up his
cloak and tossing it round his shoulders. Sweat soaked his shirt,
and the wind, forgotten in the heat of swinging the axe, seemed to
be trying to freeze it now that he had stopped work. He stifled a
yawn, shivering as he gathered the rest of his things. &ldquo;And
sleep, too, for that. I might just sleep right through
Festival.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you care to make a small wager about that?&rdquo; Tam smiled,
and Rand had to grin back. He would not miss Bel Tine if he had had
no sleep in a week. No one would.</p>

<p>Tam had been extravagant with the candles, and a fire crackled
in the big stone fireplace, so that the main room had a warm,
cheerful feel to it. A broad oaken table was the main feature of
the room other than the fireplace, a table long enough to seat a
dozen or more, though there had seldom been so many around it since
Rand&rsquo;s mother died. A few cabinets and chests, most of them
skillfully made by Tam himself, lined the walls, and high-backed
chairs stood around the table. The cushioned chair that Tam called
his reading chair sat angled before the flames. Rand preferred to
do his reading stretched out on the rug in front of the fire. The
shelf of books by the door was not nearly as long as the one at the
Winespring Inn, but books were hard to come by. Few peddlers
carried more than a handful, and those had to be stretched out
among everyone who wanted them.</p>

<p>If the room did not look quite so freshly scrubbed as most farm
wives kept their homes&mdash;Tam&rsquo;s pipe-rack and <em>The Travels of Jain
Farstrider</em> sat on the table, while another wood-bound book rested
on the cushion of his reading chair; a bit of harness to be mended
lay on the bench by the fireplace, and some shirts to be darned
made a heap on a chair&mdash;if not quite so spotless, it was
still clean and neat enough, with a lived-in look that was almost
as warming and comforting as the fire. Here, it was possible to
forget the chill beyond the walls. There was no false Dragon here.
No wars or Aes Sedai. No men in black cloaks. The aroma from the
stewpot hanging over the fire permeated the room, and filled Rand
with ravenous hunger.</p>

<p>His father stirred the stewpot with a long-handled wooden spoon,
then took a taste. &ldquo;A little while longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand hurried to wash his face and hands; there was a pitcher and
basin on the washstand by the door. A hot bath was what he wanted,
to take away the sweat and soak the chill out, but that would come
when there had been time to heat the big kettle in the back
room.</p>

<p>Tam rooted around in a cabinet and came up with a key as long as
his hand. He twisted it in the big iron lock on the door. At Rand&rsquo;s
questioning look he said, &ldquo;Best to be safe. Maybe I&rsquo;m taking a
fancy, or maybe the weather is blacking my mood, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He
sighed and bounced the key on his palm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see to the back
door,&rdquo; he said, and disappeared toward the back of the house.</p>

<p>Rand could not remember either door ever being locked. No one in
the Two Rivers locked doors. There was no need. Until now, at
least.</p>

<p>From overhead, from Tam&rsquo;s bedroom, came a scraping, as of
something being dragged across the floor. Rand frowned. Unless Tam
had suddenly decided to move the furniture around, he could only be
pulling out the old chest he kept under his bed. Another thing that
had never been done in Rand&rsquo;s memory.</p>

<p>He filled a small kettle with water for tea and hung it from a
hook over the fire, then set the table. He had carved the bowls and
spoons himself. The front shutters had not yet been closed, and
from time to time he peered out, but full night had come and all he
could see were moon shadows. The dark rider could be out there
easily enough, but he tried not to think about that.</p>

<p>When Tam came back, Rand stared in surprise. A thick belt
slanted around Tam&rsquo;s waist, and from the belt hung a sword, with a
bronze heron on the black scabbard and another on the long hilt.
The only men Rand had ever seen wearing swords were the merchants&rsquo;
guards. And Lan, of course. That his father might own one had never
even occurred to him. Except for the herons, the sword looked a
good deal like Lan&rsquo;s sword.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did that come from?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Did you get it from a
peddler? How much did it cost?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slowly Tam drew the weapon; firelight played along the gleaming
length. It was nothing at all like the plain, rough blades Rand had
seen in the hands of merchants&rsquo; guards. No gems or gold adorned it,
but it seemed grand to him, nonetheless. The blade, very slightly
curved and sharp on only one edge, bore another heron etched into
the steel. Short quillons, worked to look like braid, flanked the
hilt. It seemed almost fragile compared with the swords of the
merchants&rsquo; guards; most of those were double-edged, and thick
enough to chop down a tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got it a long time ago,&rdquo; Tam said, &ldquo;a long way from here. And
I paid entirely too much; two coppers is too much for one of these.
Your mother didn&rsquo;t approve, but she was always wiser than I. I was
young then, and it seemed worth the price at the time. She always
wanted me to get rid of it, and more than once I&rsquo;ve thought she was
right, that I should just give it away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reflected fire made the blade seem aflame. Rand started. He had
often daydreamed about owning a sword. &ldquo;Give it away? How could you
give a sword like that away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tam snorted. &ldquo;Not much use in herding sheep, now is it? Can&rsquo;t
plow a field or harvest a crop with it.&rdquo; For a long minute he
stared at the sword as if wondering what he was doing with such a
thing. At last he let out a heavy sigh. &ldquo;But if I am not just taken
by a black fancy, if our luck runs sour, maybe in the next few days
we&rsquo;ll be glad I tucked it in that old chest, instead.&rdquo; He slid the
sword smoothly back into its sheath and wiped his hand on his shirt
with a grimace. &ldquo;The stew should be ready. I&rsquo;ll dish it out while
you fix the tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand nodded and got the tea canister, but he wanted to know
everything. Why would Tam have bought a sword? He could not
imagine. And where had Tam come by it? How far away? No one ever
left the Two Rivers; or very few, at least. He had always vaguely
supposed his father must have gone outside&mdash;his mother had
been an outlander&mdash;but a sword&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? He had a lot of
questions to ask once they had settled at the table.</p>

<p>The tea water was boiling fiercely, and he had to wrap a cloth
around the kettle&rsquo;s handle to lift it off the hook. Heat soaked
through immediately. As he straightened from the fire, a heavy
thump at the door rattled the lock. All thoughts of the sword, or
the hot kettle in his hand, flew away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the neighbors,&rdquo; he
said uncertainly. &ldquo;Master Dautry wanting to borrow&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; But the
Dautry farm, their nearest neighbor, was an hour away even in the
daylight, and Oren Dautry, shameless borrower that he was, was still not likely to
leave his house by dark.</p>

<p>Tam softly placed the stew-filled bowls on the table. Slowly he
moved away from the table. Both of his hands rested on his sword
hilt. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think&mdash;&rdquo; he began, and the door burst open,
pieces of the iron lock spinning across the floor.</p>

<p>A figure filled the doorway, bigger than any man Rand had ever
seen, a figure in black mail that hung to his knees, with spikes at
wrists and elbows and shoulders. One hand clutched a heavy,
scythe-like sword; the other hand was flung up before his eyes as
if to shield them from the fight.</p>

<p>Rand felt the beginnings of an odd sort of relief. Whoever this
was, it was not the black-cloaked rider. Then he saw the curled
ram&rsquo;s horns on the head that brushed the top of the doorway, and
where mouth and nose should have been was a hairy muzzle. He took
in all of it in the space of one deep breath that he let out in a
terrified yell as, without thinking, he hurled the hot kettle at
that half-human head.</p>

<p>The creature roared, part scream of pain, part animal snarl, as
boiling water splashed over its face. Even as the kettle struck,
Tam&rsquo;s sword flashed. The roar abruptly became a gurgle, and the
huge shape toppled back. Before it finished falling, another was
trying to claw its way past. Rand glimpsed a misshapen head topped
by spike-like horns before Tam struck again, and two huge bodies
blocked the door. He realized his father was shouting at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run, lad! Hide in the woods!&rdquo; The bodies in the doorway jerked
as others outside tried to pull them clear. Tam thrust a shoulder
under the massive table; with a grunt he heaved it over atop the
tangle. &ldquo;There are too many to hold! Out the back! Go! Go! I&rsquo;ll
follow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even as Rand turned away, shame filled him that he obeyed so
quickly. He wanted to stay and help his father, though he could not
imagine how, but fear had him by the throat, and his legs moved on
their own. He dashed from the room, toward the back of the house,
as fast as he had ever run in his life. Crashes and shouts from the
front door pursued him.</p>

<p>He had his hands on the bar across the back door when his eye
fell on the iron lock that was never locked. Except that Tam had
done just that tonight. Letting the bar stay where it was, he
darted to a side window, flung up the sash and threw back the
shutters. Night had replaced twilight completely. The full moon and
drifting clouds made dappled shadows chase one another across the
farmyard.</p>

<p><em>Shadows</em>, he told himself. <em>Only shadows</em>. The back door creaked as
someone outside, or something, tried to push it open. His mouth
went dry. A crash shook the door in its frame and lent him speed;
he slipped through the window like a hare going to ground, and
cowered against the side of the house. Inside the room, wood
splintered like thunder.</p>

<p>He forced himself up to a crouch, made himself peer inside, just
with one eye, just at the corner of the window. In the dark he could
not make out much, but more than he really wanted to see. The door
hung askew, and shadowed shapes moved cautiously into the room,
talking in low, guttural voices. Rand understood none of what was
said; the language sounded harsh, unsuited to a human tongue. Axes
and spears and spiked things dully reflected stray glimmers of
moonlight. Boots scraped on the floor, and there was a rhythmic
click, as of hooves, as well.</p>

<p>He tried to work moisture back into his mouth. Drawing a deep,
ragged breath, he shouted as loudly as he could. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming in
the back!&rdquo; The words came out in a croak, but at least they came
out. He had not been sure they would. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m outside! Run, father!&rdquo;
With the last word he was sprinting away from the farmhouse.</p>

<p>Coarse-voiced shouts in the strange tongue raged from the back
room. Glass shattered, loud and sharp, and something thudded
heavily to the ground behind him. He guessed one of them had broken
through the window rather than try to squeeze through the opening,
but he did not look back to see if he was right. Like a fox running
from hounds he darted into the nearest moon-cast shadows as if
headed for the woods, then dropped to his belly and slithered back
to the barn and its larger, deeper shadows. Something fell across
his shoulders, and he thrashed about, not sure if he was trying to
fight or escape, until he realized he was grappling with the new
hoe handle Tam had been shaping.</p>

<p><em>Idiot!</em> For a moment he lay there, trying to stop panting. <em>Coplin
fool idiot!</em> At last he crawled on along the back of the barn,
dragging the hoe handle with him. It was not much, but it was
better than nothing. Cautiously he looked around the corner at the
farmyard and the house.</p>

<p>Of the creature that had jumped out after him there was no sign.
It could be anywhere. Hunting him, surely. Even creeping up on him
at that very moment.</p>

<p>Frightened bleats filled the sheep pen to his left; the flock
milled as if trying to find an escape. Shadowed shapes flickered in
the lighted front windows of the house, and the clash of steel on
steel rang through the darkness. Suddenly one of the windows burst
outward in a shower of glass and wood as Tam leaped through it,
sword still in hand. He landed on his feet, but instead of running
away from the house he dashed toward the back of it, ignoring the
monstrous things scrambling after him through the broken window and
the doorway.</p>

<p>Rand stared in disbelief. Why was he not trying to get away?
Then he understood. Tam had last heard his voice from the rear of
the house. &ldquo;Father!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m over here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In mid-stride Tam whirled, not running toward Rand, but at an
angle away from him. &ldquo;Run, lad!&rdquo; he shouted, gesturing with the
sword as if to someone ahead of him. &ldquo;Hide!&rdquo; A dozen huge forms
streamed after him, harsh shouts and shrill howls shivering the
air.</p>

<p>Rand pulled back into the shadows behind the barn. There he
could not be seen from the house, in case any of the creatures were
still inside. He was safe for the moment, at least. But not Tam.
Tam, who was trying to lead those things away from him. His hands
tightened on the hoe handle, and he had to clench his teeth to stop
a sudden laugh. A hoe handle. Facing one of those creatures with a
hoe handle would not be much like playing at quarterstaffs with
Perrin. But he could not let Tam face what was chasing him
alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I move like I was stalking a rabbit,&rdquo; he whispered to
himself, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll never hear me, or see me.&rdquo; The eerie cries echoed
in the darkness, and he tried to swallow. &ldquo;More like a pack of
starving wolves.&rdquo; Soundlessly he slipped away from the barn, toward the forest,
gripping the hoe handle so hard that his hands hurt.</p>

<p>At first, when
the trees surrounded him, he took comfort from them. They helped
hide him from whatever the creatures were that had attacked the
farm. As he crept through the woods, though, moon shadows shifted,
and it began to seem as if the darkness of the forest changed and
moved, too. Trees loomed malevolently; branches writhed toward him.
But were they just trees and branches? He could almost hear the
growling chuckles stifled in their throats while they waited for
him. The howls of Tam&rsquo;s pursuers no longer filled the night; but in
the silence that replaced them he flinched every time the wind
scraped one limb against another. Lower and lower he crouched, and
moved more and more slowly. He hardly dared to breathe for fear he
might be heard.</p>

<p>Suddenly a hand closed over his mouth from behind, and an iron
grip seized his wrist. Frantically he clawed over his shoulder with
his free hand for some hold on the attacker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t break my neck, lad,&rdquo; came Tam&rsquo;s hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>Relief flooded him, turning his muscles to water. When his
father released him he fell to his hands and knees, gasping as if
he had run for miles. Tam dropped down beside him, leaning on one
elbow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have tried that if I had thought how much you&rsquo;ve
grown in the last few years,&rdquo; Tam said softly. His eyes shifted
constantly as he spoke, keeping a sharp watch on the darkness. &ldquo;But
I had to make sure you didn&rsquo;t speak out. Some Trollocs can hear
like a dog. Maybe better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Trollocs are just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Rand let the words trail off. Not
just a story, not after tonight. Those things could be Trollocs or
the Dark One himself for all he knew. &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; he whispered.
&ldquo;I mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Trollocs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure. Though what brought them to the Two Rivers&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I
never saw one before tonight, but I&rsquo;ve talked with men who have, so
I know a little. Maybe enough to keep us alive. Listen closely. A
Trolloc can see better than a man in the dark, but bright lights
blind them, for a time at least. That may be the only reason we got
away from so many. Some can track by scent or sound, but they&rsquo;re
said to be lazy. If we can keep out of their hands long enough,
they should give up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That made Rand feel only a little better. &ldquo;In the stories they
hate men, and serve the Dark One.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If anything belongs in the Shepherd of the Night&rsquo;s flocks, lad,
it is Trollocs. They kill for the pleasure of killing, so I&rsquo;ve been
told. But that&rsquo;s the end of my knowledge, except that they cannot
be trusted unless they&rsquo;re afraid of you, and then not far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shivered. He did not think he would want to meet anyone a
Trolloc was afraid of. &ldquo;Do you think they&rsquo;re still hunting for
us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe, maybe not. They don&rsquo;t seem very smart. Once we got into
the forest, I sent the ones after me off toward the mountains
without much trouble.&rdquo; Tam fumbled at his right side, then put his
hand close to his face. &ldquo;Best act as if they are, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re hurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep your voice down. It&rsquo;s just a scratch, and there is nothing
to be done about it now, anyway. At least the weather seems to be
warming.&rdquo; He lay back with a heavy sigh. &ldquo;Perhaps it won&rsquo;t be too
bad spending the night out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the back of his mind Rand had just been thinking fond
thoughts of his coat and cloak. The trees cut the worst of the
wind, but what gusted through still sliced like a frozen knife.
Hesitantly he touched Tam&rsquo;s face, and winced. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re on fire. I
have to get you to Nynaeve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a bit, lad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have any time to waste. It&rsquo;s a long way in the dark.&rdquo;
He scrambled to his feet and tried to pull his father up. A groan
barely stifled by Tam&rsquo;s clenched teeth made Rand hastily ease him
back down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me rest a while, boy. I&rsquo;m tired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand pounded his fist on his thigh. Snug in the farmhouse, with
a fire and blankets, plenty of water and willowbark, he might have
been willing to wait for daybreak before hitching Bela and taking
Tam into the village. Here was no fire, no blankets, no cart, and
no Bela. But those things were still back at the house. If he could
not carry Tam to them, perhaps he could bring some of them, at
least, to Tam. If the Trollocs were gone. They had to go sooner or
later.</p>

<p>He looked at the hoe handle, then dropped it. Instead he drew
Tam&rsquo;s sword. The blade gleamed dully in the pale moonlight. The
long hilt felt odd in his hand; the weight and heft were strange.
He slashed at the air a few times before stopping with a sigh.
Slashing at air was easy. If he had to do it against a Trolloc he
was surely just as likely to run instead, or freeze stiff so he
could not move at all until the Trolloc swung one of those odd
swords and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Stop it! It&rsquo;s not helping anything!</em></p>

<p>As he started to rise, Tam caught his arm. &ldquo;Where are you
going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We need the cart,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;And blankets.&rdquo; He was
shocked at how easily he pulled his father&rsquo;s hand from his sleeve.
&ldquo;Rest, and I&rsquo;ll be back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Careful,&rdquo; Tam breathed.</p>

<p>He could not see Tam&rsquo;s face in the moonlight, but he could feel
his eyes on him. &ldquo;I will be.&rdquo; <em>As careful as a mouse exploring a
hawk&rsquo;s nest</em>, he thought.</p>

<p>As silently as another shadow, he slid into the darkness. He
thought of all the times he had played tag in the woods with his
friends as children, stalking one another, straining not to be
heard until he put a hand on someone&rsquo;s shoulder. Somehow he could
not make this seem the same.</p>

<p>Creeping from tree to tree, he tried to make a plan, but by the
time he reached the edge of the woods he had made and discarded
ten. Everything depended on whether or not the Trollops were still
there. If they were gone, he could simply walk up to the house and
take what he needed. If they were still there&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;In that case,
there was nothing for it but to go back to Tam. He did not like it,
but he could do Tam no good by getting killed.</p>

<p>He peered toward the farm buildings. The barn and the sheep pen
were only dark shapes in the moonlight. Light spilled from the
front windows of the house, though, and through the open front
door. <em>Just the candles father lit, or are there Trollocs
waiting?</em></p>

<p>He jumped convulsively at a nighthawk&rsquo;s reedy cry, then sagged
against a tree, shaking. This was getting him nowhere. Dropping to
his belly, he began to crawl, holding the sword awkwardly before
him. He kept his chin in the dirt all the way to the back of the
sheep pen.</p>

<p>Crouched against the stone wall, he listened. Not a sound
disturbed the night. Carefully he eased up enough to look over the
wall. Nothing moved in the farmyard. No shadows flickered against
the lit windows of the house, or in the doorway. <em>Bela and the cart
first, or the blankets and other things?</em> It was the light that
decided him. The barn was dark. Anything could be waiting inside,
and he would have no way of knowing until it was too late. At least
he would be able to see what was inside the house.</p>

<p>As he started to lower himself again, he stopped suddenly. There
was <em>no</em> sound. Most of the sheep might have settled down already and
gone back to sleep, though it was not likely, but a few were always
awake even in the middle of the night, rustling about, bleating now
and again. He could barely make out the shadowy mounds of sheep on
the ground. One lay almost beneath him.</p>

<p>Trying to make no noise, he hoisted himself onto the wall until
he could stretch out a hand to the dim shape. His fingers touched
curly wool, then wetness; the sheep did not move. Breath left him
in a rush as he pushed back, almost dropping the sword as he fell
to the ground outside the pen. <em>They kill for fun</em>. Shakily he
scrubbed the wetness from his hand in the dirt.</p>

<p>Fiercely he told himself that nothing had changed. The Trollocs
had done their butchery and gone. Repeating that in his mind, he
crawled on across the farmyard, keeping as low as he could, but
trying to watch every direction, too. He had never thought he would
envy an earthworm.</p>

<p>At the front of the house he lay close beside the wall, beneath
the broken window, and listened. The dull thudding of blood in his
ears was the loudest sound he heard. Slowly he reared up and peered
inside.</p>

<p>The stewpot lay upside down in the ashes on the hearth.
Splintered, broken wood littered the room; not a single piece of
furniture remained whole. Even the table rested at an angle, two
legs hacked to rough stubs. Every drawer had been pulled out and
smashed; every cupboard and cabinet stood open, many doors hanging
by one hinge. Their contents were strewn over the wreckage, and
everything was dusted with white. Flour and salt, to judge from the
slashed sacks tossed down by the fireplace. Four twisted bodies
made a tangle in the remnants of the furnishings. Trollocs.</p>

<p>Rand recognized one by its ram&rsquo;s horns. The others were much the
same, even in their differences, a repulsive m&eacute;lange of
human faces distorted by muzzles, horns, feathers, and fur. Their
hands, almost human, only made it worse. Two wore boots; the others
had hooves. He watched without blinking until his eyes burned. None
of the Trollocs moved. They had to be dead. And Tam was
waiting.</p>

<p>He ran in through the front door and stopped, gagging at the
stench. A stable that had not been mucked out in months was the
only thing he could think of that might come close to matching it.
Vile smears defiled the walls. Trying to breathe through his mouth,
he hurriedly began poking through the mess on the floor. There had
been a waterbag in one of the cupboards.</p>

<p>A scraping sound behind him sent a chill to his marrow, and he
spun, almost falling over the remains of the table. He caught
himself, and moaned behind teeth that would have chattered had he
not had them clenched until his jaw ached.</p>

<p>One of the Trollocs was getting to its feet. A wolf&rsquo;s muzzle
jutted out below sunken eyes. Flat, emotionless eyes, and all too
human. Hairy, pointed ears twitched incessantly. It stepped over
one of its dead companions on sharp goat hooves. The same black
mail the others wore rasped against leather trousers, and one of
the huge, scythe-curved swords swung at its side.</p>

<p>It muttered something, guttural and sharp, then said, &ldquo;Others go
away. Narg stay. Narg smart.&rdquo; The words were distorted and hard to
understand, coming from a mouth never meant for human speech. Its
tone was meant to be soothing, he thought, but he could not take
his eyes off the stained teeth, long and sharp, that flashed every
time the creature spoke. &ldquo;Narg know some come back sometime. Narg
wait. You no need sword. Put sword down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Until the Trolloc spoke Rand had not realized that he held Tam&rsquo;s
sword wavering before him in both hands, its point aimed at the
huge creature. It towered head and shoulders above him, with a
chest and arms to dwarf Master Luhhan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Narg no hurt.&rdquo; It took a step closer, gesturing. &ldquo;You put sword
down.&rdquo; The dark hair on the backs of its hands was thick, like
fur.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay back,&rdquo; Rand said, wishing his voice were steadier. &ldquo;Why
did you do this? Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Vlja daeg roghda!</em>&rdquo; The snarl quickly became a toothy smile.
&ldquo;Put sword down. Narg no hurt. Myrddraal want talk you.&rdquo; A flash of
emotion crossed the distorted face. Fear. &ldquo;Others come back, you talk Myrddraal.&rdquo;
It took another step,
one big hand coming to rest on its own sword hilt. &ldquo;You put sword
down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand wet his lips. Myrddraal! The worst of the stories was
walking tonight. If a Fade was coming, it made a Trolloc pale by
comparison. He had to get away. But if the Trolloc drew that
massive blade he would not have a chance. He forced his lips into a
shaky smile. &ldquo;All right.&rdquo; Grip tightening on the sword, he let both
hands drop to his sides. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wolf-smile became a snarl, and the Trolloc lunged for him.
Rand had not thought anything that big could move so fast.
Desperately he brought his sword up. The monstrous body crashed
into him, slamming him against the wall. Breath left his lungs in
one gasp. He fought for air as they fell to the floor together, the
Trolloc on top. Frantically he struggled beneath the crushing
weight, trying to avoid thick hands groping for him, and snapping
jaws.</p>

<p>Abruptly the Trolloc spasmed and was still. Battered and
bruised, half suffocated by the bulk on top of him, for a moment
Rand could only lie there in disbelief. Quickly he came to his
senses, though, enough to writhe out from under the body, at least.
And body it was. The bloodied blade of Tam&rsquo;s sword stood out from
the center of the Trolloc&rsquo;s back. He had gotten it up in time after
all. Blood covered Rand&rsquo;s hands, as well, and made a blackish smear
across the front of his shirt. His stomach churned, and he
swallowed hard to keep from being sick. He shook as hard as he had
in the worst of his fear, but this time in relief at still being
alive.</p>

<p>Others come back, the Trolloc had said. The other Trollocs would
be returning to the farmhouse. And a Myrddraal, a Fade. The stories
said Fades were twenty feet tall, with eyes of fire, and they rode
shadows like horses. When a Fade turned sideways, it disappeared,
and no wall could stop them. He had to do what he had come for, and
get away quickly.</p>

<p>Grunting with the effort he heaved the Trolloc&rsquo;s body over to
get to the sword&mdash;and almost ran when open eyes stared at
him. It took him a minute to realize they were staring through the
glaze of death.</p>

<p>He wiped his hands on a tattered rag&mdash;it had been one of
Tam&rsquo;s shirts only that morning&mdash;and tugged the blade
free. Cleaning the sword, he reluctantly dropped the rag on the floor.
There was no time for neatness, he thought with a laugh that he had
to clamp his teeth shut to stop. He did not see how they could ever
clean the house well enough for it to be lived in again. The
horrible stench had probably already soaked right into the timbers.
But there was no time to think of that. <em>No time for neatness</em>. <em>No
time for anything, maybe</em>.</p>

<p>He was sure he was forgetting any number of things they would
need, but Tam was waiting, and the Trollocs were coming back. He
gathered what he could think of on the run. Blankets from the
bedrooms upstairs, and clean cloths to bandage Tam&rsquo;s wound. Their
cloaks and coats. A waterbag that he carried when he took the sheep
to pasture. A clean shirt. He did not know when he would have time
to change, but he wanted to get out of his blood-smeared shirt at
the first opportunity. The small bags of willowbark and their other
medicines were part of a dark, muddy-looking pile he could not
bring himself to touch.</p>

<p>One bucket of the water Tam had brought in still stood by the
fireplace, miraculously unspilled and untouched. He filled the
waterbag from it, gave his hands a hasty wash in the rest, and made
one more quick search for anything he might have forgotten. He
found his bow among the wreckage, broken cleanly in two at the
thickest point. He shuddered as he let the pieces fall. What he had
gathered already would have to do, he decided. Quickly he piled
everything outside the door.</p>

<p>The last thing before leaving the house, he dug a shuttered
lantern from the mess on the floor. It still held oil. Lighting it
from one of the candles, he closed the shutters&mdash;partly against the
wind, but mostly to keep from drawing attention&mdash;and hurried
outside with the lantern in one hand and the sword in the other. He
was not sure what he would find in the barn. The sheep pen kept him
from hoping too much. But he needed the cart to get Tam to Emond&rsquo;s
Field, and for the cart he needed Bela. Necessity made him hope a
little.</p>

<p>The barn doors stood open, one creaking on its hinges as it
shifted in the wind. The interior looked as it always had, at
first. Then his eyes fell on empty stalls, the stall doors ripped
from their hinges. Bela and the cow were gone. Quickly he went to
the back of the barn. The cart lay on its side, half the spokes
broken out of its wheels. One shaft was only a foot-long stump.</p>

<p>The despair he had been holding at bay filled him. He was not
sure he could carry Tam as far as the village even if his father
could bear to be carried. The pain of it might kill Tam more
quickly than the fever. Still, it was the only chance left. He had
done all he could do here. As he turned to go, his eyes fell on the
hacked-off cart shaft lying on the straw-strewn floor. Suddenly he
smiled.</p>

<p>Hurriedly he set the lantern and the sword on the straw-covered
floor, and in the next instant he was wrestling with the cart,
tipping it back over to fall upright with a snap of more breaking
spokes, then throwing his shoulder into it to heave it over on the
other side. The undamaged shaft stood straight out. Snatching up
the sword he hacked at the well-seasoned ash. To his pleased
surprise great chips flew with his strokes, and he cut through as
quickly as he could have with a good axe.</p>

<p>When the shaft fell free, he looked at the sword blade in
wonder. Even the best-sharpened axe would have dulled chopping
through that hard, aged wood, but the sword looked as brightly
sharp as ever. He touched the edge with his thumb, then hastily
stuck it in his mouth. The blade was still razor-sharp.</p>

<p>But he had no time for wonder. Blowing out the lantern&mdash;there was
no need to have the barn burn down on top of everything else&mdash;he gathered up the shafts and ran back to get what he had left at
the house.</p>

<p>Altogether it made an awkward burden. Not a heavy one, but hard
to balance and manage, the cart shafts shifting and twisting in his
arms as he stumbled across the plowed field. Once back in the
forest they were even worse, catching on trees and knocking him
half off his feet. They would have been easier to drag, but that
would leave a clear trail behind him, He intended to wait as long
as possible before doing that.</p>

<p>Tam was right where he had left him, seemingly asleep. He hoped
it was sleep. Suddenly fearful, he dropped his burdens and put a
hand to his father&rsquo;s face. Tam still breathed, but the fever was
worse.</p>

<p>The touch roused Tam, but only into a hazy wakefulness. &ldquo;Is that
you, boy?&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;Worried about you. Dreams of days gone.
Nightmares.&rdquo; Murmuring softly, he drifted off again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; Rand said. He lay Tam&rsquo;s coat and cloak over him
to keep off the wind. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you to Nynaeve just as quick as I
can.&rdquo; As he went on, as much to reassure himself as for Tam&rsquo;s
benefit, he peeled off his bloodstained shirt, hardly even noticing
the cold in his haste to be rid of it, and hurriedly pulled on the
clean one. Throwing his old shirt away made him feel as if he had
just had a bath. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be safe in the village in no time, and the
Wisdom will set everything right. You&rsquo;ll see. Everything&rsquo;s going to
be all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That thought was like a beacon as he pulled on his coat and bent
to tend Tam&rsquo;s wound. They would be safe once they reached the
village, and Nynaeve would cure Tam. He just had to get him
there.</p>
