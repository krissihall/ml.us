walked along placidly under the weak sun as if
the three wolves trotting not far off were only village dogs, but
the way she rolled her eyes at them from time to time, showing
white all the way around, indicated she felt nothing of the sort.
Egwene, on the mare&rsquo;s back, was just as bad. She watched the wolves
constantly from the corner of her eye, and sometimes she twisted in
the saddle to look around. Perrin was sure she was hunting for the

and Wind, no wolves were to be seen. In the pale, early daylight,
deep shade still lingered under the big oak, and the bare trees
beyond looked like fingers stripped to the bone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re around,&rdquo; Elyas answered when Egwene asked
where the rest of the pack had gone. &ldquo;Close enough to help, if need
be. Far enough off to avoid any human trouble we get into. Sooner
or later there&rsquo;s always trouble when there&rsquo;s two humans together.
If we need
