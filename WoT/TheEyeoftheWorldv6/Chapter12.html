came down the stairs, telling the company to dismount and
lead their horses after him through the fog. Again they had to
trust that the Warder knew where he was going. The fog swirled
around Rand&rsquo;s knees, hiding his feet, obscuring everything more
than a yard away. The fog was not as heavy as it had been outside
the town, but he could barely make out his companions.</p>

<p>Still no human stirred in the night except for them. A few more
windows than before showed a light, but the thick mist turned most
of them to dim patches, and as often as not that hazy glow, hanging
in the gray, was all that was visible. Other houses, revealing a
little more, seemed to float on a sea of cloud or to thrust
abruptly out of the mist while their neighbors remained hidden, so
that they could have stood alone for miles around.</p>

<p>Rand moved stiffly from the ache of the long ride, wondering if
there was any way he could walk the rest of the way to Tar Valon.
Not that walking was much better than riding at that moment, of
course, but even so his feet were almost the only part of him that
was not sore. At least he was used to walking.</p>

<p>Only once did anyone speak loudly enough for Rand to hear
clearly. &ldquo;You must handle it,&rdquo; Moiraine said in answer to something
unheard from Lan. &ldquo;He will remember too much as it is, and no help
for it. If I stand out in his thoughts&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand grumpily shifted his now-sodden cloak on his shoulders
keeping close with the others. Mat and Perrin grumbled to
themselves, muttering under their breaths, with bitten-off
exclamations whenever one stubbed a toe on something unseen. Thom
Merrilin grumbled, too, words like &ldquo;hot meal&rdquo; or &ldquo;fire&rdquo; and &ldquo;mulled
wine&rdquo; reaching Rand, but neither the Warder nor the Aes Sedai took
notice. Egwene marched along without a word, her back straight and
her head high. It was somewhat painfully hesitant march, to be
sure, for she was unused to riding as the rest.</p>

<p>She was getting her adventure, he thought glumly, and long as it
lasted he doubted if she would notice little things like fog or
damp or cold. There must be a difference in what you saw, it seemed
to him, depending on whether you sought adventure or had it forced
on you. The stories could no doubt make galloping through a cold
fog, with a Draghkar and the Light alone knew what else chasing
you, sound thrilling. Egwene might be feeling a thrill; he only
felt cold and damp and glad to have a village around him again,
even if it was Taren Ferry.</p>

<p>Abruptly he walked into something large and warm in the murk:
Lan&rsquo;s stallion. The Warder and Moiraine had stopped and the rest of
the party did the same, patting their mounts much to comfort
themselves as the animals. The fog was a little thinner here,
enough for them to see one another more clearly than they had in a
long while, but not enough to make out much more. Their feet were
still hidden by low billows like gray floodwater. The houses seemed
to have all been swallowed.</p>

<p>Cautiously Rand led Cloud forward a
little way and was surprised to hear his boots scrape on wooden
planks. The ferry landing. He backed up carefully, making the gray
back as well. He had heard that the Taren Ferry landing was like a
bridge that led nowhere except to the ferryboat. The Taren was
supposed to be wide and deep, with treacherous currents that could
pull under the strongest swimmer. Much wider than Winespring Water,
he supposed. With the fog added in&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;It was a relief when he felt
dirt under his feet again.</p>

<p>A fierce &ldquo;Hsst!&rdquo; from Lan, as sharp as the fog. The Warder
gestured at them as he dashed to Perrin&rsquo;s side and threw back the
stocky youth&rsquo;s cloak, exposing the great axe. Obediently, but still
not understanding, Rand tossed his own cloak over his shoulder to
show his sword. As Lan moved swiftly back to his horse, bobbing
lights appeared in the mist, and muffled footsteps approached.</p>

<p>Six stolid-faced men in rough clothes followed Master Hightower.
The torches they carried burned away a patch of fog around them.
When they stopped, all of the party from Emond&rsquo;s Field could be
plainly seen, the lot of them surrounded by a gray wall that seemed
thicker for the torchlight reflected from it. The ferryman examined
them, his narrow head tilted, nose twitching like a weasel sniffing
the breeze for a trap.</p>

<p>Lan leaned against his saddle with apparent casualness, but one
hand rested ostentatiously on the long hilt of his sword. There was
an air about him of a metal spring, compressed, waiting.</p>

<p>Rand hurriedly copied the Warder&rsquo;s pose&mdash;at least insofar
as putting his hand on his sword. He did not think he could achieve
that deadly-seeming slouch. <em>They&rsquo;d probably laugh if I tried</em>.</p>

<p>Perrin eased his axe in its leather loop and planted his feet
deliberately. Mat put a hand to his quiver, though Rand was not
sure what condition his bowstring was in after being out in all
this damp. Thom Merrilin stepped forward grandly and held up one
empty hand, turning it slowly. Suddenly he gestured with a
flourish, and a dagger twirled between his fingers. The hilt
slapped into his palm, and, abruptly nonchalant, he began trimming
his fingernails.</p>

<p>A low, delighted laugh floated from Moiraine. Egwene clapped as
if watching a performance at Festival, then stopped and looked
abashed, though her mouth twitched with a smile just the same.</p>

<p>Hightower seemed far from amused. He stared at Thom, then
cleared his throat loudly. &ldquo;There was mention made of more gold for
the crossing.&rdquo; He looked around at them again, a sullen, sly look.
&ldquo;What you gave me before is in a safe place now, hear? It&rsquo;s none of
it where you can get at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The rest of the gold,&rdquo; Lan told him, &ldquo;goes into your hand when
we are on the other side.&rdquo; The leather purse hanging at his waist
clinked as he gave it a little shake.</p>

<p>For a moment the ferryman&rsquo;s eyes darted, but at last he nodded.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be about it, then,&rdquo; he muttered, and stalked out onto the
landing followed by his six helpers. The fog burned away around
them as they moved; gray tendrils closed in behind, quickly filling
where they had been. Rand hurried to keep up.</p>

<p>The ferry itself was a wooden barge with high sides, boarded by
a ramp that could be raised to block off the end. Ropes as thick as
a man&rsquo;s wrist ran along each side of it, ropes fastened to massive
posts at the end of the landing and disappearing into the night
over the river. The ferryman&rsquo;s helpers stuck their torches in iron
brackets on the ferry&rsquo;s sides, waited while everyone led their
horses aboard, then pulled up the ramp. The deck creaked beneath
hooves and shuffling feet, and the ferry shifted with the
weight.</p>

<p>Hightower muttered half under his breath, growling for them to
keep the horses still and stay to the center, out of the haulers&rsquo;
way. He shouted at his helpers, chivvying them as they readied the
ferry to cross, but the men moved at the same reluctant speed
whatever he said, and he was half-hearted about it, often cutting
off in mid-shout to hold his torch high and peel into the fog.
Finally he stopped shouting altogether and went to the bow, where
he stood staring into the mist that covered the river. He did not
move until one of the haulers touched his arm; then he jumped,
glaring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? Oh. You, is it? Ready? About time. Well, man, what are
you waiting for?&rdquo; He waved his arms heedless of the torch and the
way the horses whickered and tried to move back. &ldquo;Cast off! Give
way! Move!&rdquo; The man slouched off to comply, and Hightower peered
once more into the fog ahead, rubbing his free hand uneasily on his
coat front.</p>

<p>The ferry lurched as its moorings were loosed and the strong
current caught it, then lurched again as the guide-ropes held it.
The haulers, three to a side, grabbed hold of the ropes at the
front of the ferry and laboriously began walking toward the back,
muttering uneasily as they edged out onto the gray cloaked
river.</p>

<p>The landing disappeared as mist surrounded them, tenuous
streamers drifting across the ferry between the flickering torches.
The barge rocked slowly in the current. Nothing except the steady
tread of the haulers, forward to take hold of the ropes and back
down again pulling, gave a hint of any other movement. No one
spoke. The villagers kept as close to the center of the ferry as
they could. They had heard the Taren was far wider than the streams
they were used to; the fog made it infinitely vaster in their
minds.</p>

<p>After a time Rand moved closer to Lan. Rivers a man could not
wade or swim or even see across were nervous-making to someone who
had never seen anything broader or deeper than a Waterwood pond.
&ldquo;Would they really have tried to rob us?&rdquo; he asked quietly. &ldquo;He
acted more as if he were afraid we would rob him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Warder eyed the ferryman and his helpers&mdash;none
appeared to be listening&mdash;before answering just as softly.
&ldquo;With the fog to hide them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well, when what they do is hidden,
men sometimes deal with strangers in ways they wouldn&rsquo;t if there
were other eyes to see. And the quickest to harm a stranger are the
soonest to think a stranger will harm them. This fellow&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I
believe he might sell his mother to Trollocs for stew meat if the
price was right. I&rsquo;m a little surprised you ask. I heard the way
people in Emond&rsquo;s Field speak of those from Taren Ferry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Well, everyone says they&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;But I never
thought they would. Actually&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Rand decided he had better stop
thinking that he knew anything at all of what people were like
beyond his own village. &ldquo;He might tell the Fade we crossed on the
ferry,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;ll bring the Trollocs over after
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan chuckled dryly. &ldquo;Robbing a stranger is one thing, dealing
with a Halfman something else again. Can you really see him
ferrying Trollocs over, especially in this fog, no matter how much
gold was offered? Or even talking to a Myrddraal, if he had any
choice? Just the thought of it would keep him running for a month.
I don&rsquo;t think we have to worry very much about Darkfriends in Taren
Ferry. Not here. We are safe for a time, at least. From this lot,
anyway. Watch yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hightower had turned from peering into the fog ahead. Pointed
face pushed forward and torch held high, he stared at Lan and Rand
as if seeing them clearly for the first time. Deck-planks creaked
under the haulers&rsquo; feet and the occasional stamp of a hoof.
Abruptly the ferryman twitched as he realized they were watching
him watching them. With a leap he spun back to looking for the far
bank, or whatever it was he sought in the fog.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say no more,&rdquo; Lan said, so softly Rand almost could not
understand. &ldquo;These are bad days to speak of Trollocs, or
Darkfriends, or the Father of Lies, with strange ears to hear. Such
talk can bring worse than the Dragon&rsquo;s Fang scrawled on your
door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand felt no desire to go on with his questions. Gloom settled
on him even more than it had before. Darkfriends! As if Fades and
Trollocs and Draghkar were not enough to worry about. At least you
could tell a Trolloc at sight.</p>

<p>Abruptly pilings loomed shadowy in the mist before them. The
ferry thudded against the far bank, and then the haulers were
hurrying to lash the craft fast and let down the ramp at that end
with a thump, while Mat and Perrin announced loudly that the Taren
was not half as wide as they had heard. Lan led his stallion down
the ramp, followed by Moiraine and the others. As Rand, the last,
took Cloud down behind Bela, Master Hightower called out
angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, now! Here! Where&rsquo;s my gold?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It shall be paid. &ldquo;Moiraine&rsquo;s voice came from somewhere in the
mist. Rand&rsquo;s boots clumped from the ramp to a wooden landing. &ldquo;And
a silver mark for each of your men,&rdquo; the Aes Sedai added, &ldquo;for the
quick crossing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ferryman hesitated, face pushed forward as if he smelled
danger, but at the mention of silver the haulers roused themselves.
Some paused to seize a torch, but they all thumped down the ramp
before Hightower could open his mouth. With a sullen grimace, the
ferryman followed his crew.</p>

<p>Cloud&rsquo;s hooves clumped hollowly in the fog as Rand made his way
carefully along the landing. The gray mist was as thick here as
over the river. At the foot of the landing, the Warder was handing
out coins, surrounded by the torches of Hightower and his fellows.
Everyone else except Moiraine waited just beyond in an anxious
cluster. The Aes Sedai stood looking at the river, though what she
could see was beyond Rand. With a shiver he hitched up his cloak,
sodden as it was. He was really out of the Two Rivers, now, and it
seemed much farther away than the width of a river.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; Lan said, handing a last coin to Hightower. &ldquo;As agreed.&rdquo; He did not put up his purse, and the ferrety-faced man eyed it
greedily.</p>

<p>With a loud creak, the landing shivered. Hightower jerked
upright, head swivelling back toward the mist-cloaked ferry.
The torches remaining on board were a pair of dim, fuzzy points
of light. The landing groaned, and with a thunderous crack of
snapping wood, the twin glows lurched, then began to revolve.
Egwene cried out wordlessly, and Thom cursed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s loose!&rdquo; Hightower screamed. Grabbing his haulers, he
pushed them toward the end of the landing. &ldquo;The ferry&rsquo;s loose, you
fools! Get it! Get it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The haulers stumbled a few steps under Hightower&rsquo;s shoves, then
stopped. The faint lights on the ferry spun faster, then faster
still. The fog above them swirled, sucked into a spiral. The
landing trembled. The cracking and splintering of wood filled the
air as the ferry began breaking apart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whirlpool,&rdquo; one of the haulers said, his voice filled with
awe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No whirlpools on the Taren.&rdquo; Hightower sounded empty. &ldquo;Never
been a whirlpool&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An unfortunate occurrence.&rdquo; Moiraine&rsquo;s voice was hollow in
the fog that made her a shadow as she turned from the river.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unfortunate,&rdquo; Lan agreed in a flat tone. &ldquo;It seems you&rsquo;ll be
carrying no one else across the river for a time. An ill thing that
you lost your craft in our service.&rdquo; He delved again into his
purse, ready in his hand. &ldquo;This should repay you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Hightower stared at the gold, glinting in Lan&rsquo;s
hand in the torchlight, then his shoulders hunched and his eyes
darted to the others he had carried across. Made indistinct by the
fog, the Emond&rsquo;s Fielders stood silently. With a frightened,
inarticulate cry, the ferryman snatched the coins from Lan,
whirled, and ran into the mist. His haulers were only half a step
behind him, their torches quickly swallowed as they vanished
upriver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing further to hold us here,&rdquo; the Aes Sedai said
as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened. Leading her white
mare, she started away from the landing, up the bank.</p>

<p>Rand stood staring at the hidden river. <em>It could have been
happenstance. No whirlpools, he said, but it</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Abruptly he
realized everyone else had gone. Hurriedly he scrambled up the
gently sloping bank.</p>

<p>In the space of t
