<h4><em>Out of the Woods</em></h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">G</span>ray
first light came while Rand still trudged through the
forest. At first he did not really see. When he finally did, he
stared at the fading darkness in surprise. No matter what his eyes
told him, he could hardly believe he had spent all night trying to
travel the distance from the farm to Emond&rsquo;s Field. Of course, the
Quarry Road by day, rocks and all, was a far cry from the woods by
night. On the other hand, it seemed days since he had seen the
black-cloaked rider on the road, weeks since he and Tam had gone in
for their supper. He no longer felt the strip of cloth digging into
his shoulders, but then he felt nothing in his shoulders except
numbness, nor in his feet, for that matter. In between, it was
another matter. His breath came in labored pants that had long
since set his throat and lungs to burning, and hunger twisted his
stomach into queasy sickness.</p>

<p>Tam had fallen silent some time before. Rand was not sure how
long it had been since the murmurs ceased, but he did not dare halt
now to check on Tam. If he stopped he would never be able to force
himself to start out again. Anyway, whatever Tam&rsquo;s condition, he
could do nothing beyond what he was doing. The only hope lay ahead,
in the village. He tried wearily to increase his pace, but his
wooden legs continued their slow plod. He barely even noticed the
cold, or the wind.</p>

<p>Vaguely he caught the smell of woodsmoke. At
least he was almost there if he could smell the village chimneys. A
tired smile had only begun on his face, though, when it turned to a
frown. Smoke lay heavy in the air&mdash;too heavy. With the
weather, a fire might well be blazing on every hearth in the
village, but the smoke was still too strong. In his mind he saw
again the Trollocs on the road. Trollocs coming from the east, from
the direction of Emond&rsquo;s Field. He peered ahead, trying to make out
the first houses, and ready to shout for help at the first sight of
anyone, even Cenn Buie or one of the Coplins. A small voice in the
back of his head told him to hope someone there could still give
help.</p>

<p>Suddenly a house became visible through the last bare-branched
trees, and it was all he could do to keep his feet moving. Hope
turning to sharp despair, he staggered into the village.</p>

<p>Charred piles of rubble stood in the places of half the houses
of Emond&rsquo;s Field. Soot-coated brick chimneys thrust like dirty
fingers from heaps of blackened timbers. Thin wisps of smoke still
rose from the ruins. Grimy-faced villagers, some yet in their night
clothes, poked through the ashes, here pulling free a cookpot,
there simply prodding forlornly at the wreckage with a stick. What
little had been rescued from the flames dotted the streets; tall
mirrors and polished sideboards and highchests stood in the dust
among chairs and tables buried under bedding, cooking utensils, and
meagre piles of clothing and personal belongings.</p>

<p>The destruction seemed scattered at random through the village.
Five houses marched untouched in one row, while in another place a
lone survivor stood surrounded by desolation.</p>

<p>On the far side of the Winespring Water, the three huge Bel Tine
bonfires roared, tended by a cluster of men. Thick columns of black
smoke bent northward with the wind, flecked by careless sparks. One
of Master al&rsquo;Vere&rsquo;s Dhurran stallions was dragging something Rand
could not make out over the ground toward the Wagon Bridge, and the
flames.</p>

<p>Before he was well out of the trees, a sooty-faced Haral Luhhan
hurried to him, clutching a woodsman&rsquo;s axe in one thick-fingered
hand. The burly blacksmith&rsquo;s ash-smeared nightshirt hung to his
boots, the angry red welt of a burn across his chest showing
through a ragged tear. He dropped to one knee beside the litter.
Tam&rsquo;s eyes were closed, and his breathing came low and hard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trollocs, boy?&rdquo; Master Luhhan asked in a smoke-hoarse voice.
&ldquo;Here, too. Here, too. Well, we may have been luckier than anyone
has a right to be, if you can credit it. He needs the Wisdom. Now
where in the Light is she? Egwene!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene, running by with her arms full of bed sheets torn into
bandages, looked around at them without slowing. Her eyes stared at
something in the far distance; dark circles made them appear even
larger than they actually were. Then she saw Rand and stopped,
drawing a shuddering breath. &ldquo;Oh, no, Rand, not your father? Is he&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Come, I&rsquo;ll take you to Nynaeve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand was too tired, too stunned, to speak. All through the night
Emond&rsquo;s Field had been a haven, where he Tam would be safe. Now all
he could seem to do was stare in dismay at her smoke-stained dress.
He noticed odd details as if they were very important. The buttons
down the back of her dress were done up crookedly. And her hands
were clean. He wondered why her hands were clean when smudges of
soot marked her cheeks.</p>

<p>Master Luhhan seemed to understand what had come over him.
Laying his axe across the shafts, the blacksmith picked up the rear
of the litter and gave it a gentle push, prodding him to follow
Egwene. He stumbled after her as if walking in his sleep. Briefly
he wondered how Master Luhhan knew the creatures were Trollocs, but
it was a fleeting thought. If Tam could recognize them, there was
no reason why Haral Luhhan could not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the stories are real,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it seems, lad,&rdquo; the blacksmith said. &ldquo;So it seems.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand only half heard. He was concentrating on following Egwene&rsquo;s
slender shape. He had pulled himself together just enough to wish
she would hurry, though in truth she was keeping her pace to what
the two men could manage with their burden. She led them halfway
down the Green, to the Calder house. Char blackened the edges of
its thatch, and smut stained the whitewashed walls. Of the houses
on either side only the foundation stones were left, and two piles
of ash and burned timbers. One had been the house of Berin Thane,
one of the miller&rsquo;s brothers. The other had been Abell Cauthon&rsquo;s.
Mat&rsquo;s father. Even the chimneys had toppled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait here,&rdquo; Egwene said, and gave them a look as if expecting
an answer. When they only stood there, she muttered something under
her breath, then dashed inside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;Is he&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s alive,&rdquo; the blacksmith said. He set down his end of the
litter and straightened slowly. &ldquo;I saw him a little while ago. It&rsquo;s
a wonder any of us are alive. The way they came after my house, and
the forge, you&rsquo;d have thought I had gold and jewels in there.
Alsbet cracked one&rsquo;s skull with a frying pan. She took one look at
the ashes of our house this morning and set out hunting around the
village with the biggest hammer she could dig out of what&rsquo;s left
of the forge, just in case any of them hid instead of running away.
I could almost pity the thing if she finds one.&rdquo; He nodded to the
Calder house. &ldquo;Mistress Calder and a few others took in some of
those who were hurt, the ones with no home of their own still
standing. When the Wisdom&rsquo;s seen Tam, we&rsquo;ll find him a bed. The
inn, maybe. The Mayor offered it already, but Nynaeve said the hurt
folk would heal better if there weren&rsquo;t so many of them
together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand sank to his knees. Shrugging out of his blanket harness, he
wearily busied himself with checking Tam&rsquo;s covers. Tam never moved
or made a sound, even when Rand&rsquo;s wooden hands jostled him. But he
was still breathing, at least. <em>My father. The other was just the
fever talking</em>. &ldquo;What if they come back?&rdquo; he said dully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills,&rdquo; Master Luhhan said
uneasily. &ldquo;If they come back&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Well, they&rsquo;re gone, now. So we
pick up the pieces, build up what&rsquo;s been torn down.&rdquo; He sighed, his
face going slack as he knuckled the small of his
back. For the first time Rand realized that the heavyset man was as
tired as he was himself, if not more so. The blacksmith looked at
the village, shaking his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose today will be much
of a Bel Tine. But we&rsquo;ll make it through. We always have.&rdquo; Abruptly
he took up his axe, and his face firmed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s work waiting for
me. Don&rsquo;t you worry, lad. The Wisdom will take good care of him,
and the Light will take care of us all. And if the Light doesn&rsquo;t,
well, we&rsquo;ll just take care of ourselves. Remember, we&rsquo;re Two Rivers
folk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still on his knees, Rand looked at the village as the blacksmith
walked away, really looked for the first time. Master Luhhan was
right, he thought, and was surprised that he was not surprised by
what he saw. People still dug in the ruins of their homes, but even
in the short time he had been there more of them had begun to move
with a sense of purpose. He could almost feel the growing
determination. But he wondered. They had seen Trollocs; had they
seen the black-cloaked rider? Had they felt his hatred?</p>

<p>Nynaeve and Egwene appeared from the Calder house, and he sprang
to his feet. Or rather, he tried to spring to his feet; it was more
of a stumbling lurch that almost put him on his face in the
dust.</p>

<p>The Wisdom dropped to her knees beside the litter without giving
him so much as a glance. Her face and dress were even dirtier than
Egwene&rsquo;s, and the same dark circles fined her eyes, though her
hands, too, were clean. She felt Tam&rsquo;s face and thumbed open his
eyelids. With a frown she pulled down the coverings and eased the
bandage aside to look at the wound. Before Rand could see what lay
underneath she had replaced the wadded cloth. Sighing, she smoothed
the blanket and cloak back up to Tam&rsquo;s neck with a gentle touch, as
if tucking a child in for the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing I can do,&rdquo; she said. She had to put her hands
on her knees to straighten up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment he
stood, not understanding, as she started back to the house, then he
scrambled after her and pulled her around to face him. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
dying,&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said simply, and he sagged with the
matter-of-factness of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have to do something. You have to. You&rsquo;re the Wisdom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pain twisted her face, but only for an instant, then she was all
hollow-eyed resolve again, her voice emotionless and firm. &ldquo;Yes, I
am. I know what I can do with my medicines, and I know when it&rsquo;s
too late. Don&rsquo;t you think I would do something if I could? But I
can&rsquo;t. I can&rsquo;t, Rand. And there are others who need me. People I
<em>can</em> help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I brought him to you as quickly as I could,&rdquo; he mumbled.
Even with the village in ruins, there had been the Wisdom for
hope. With that gone, he was empty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you did,&rdquo; she said gently. She touched his cheek with
her hand. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t your fault. You did the best anyone could. I am
sorry, Rand, but I have others to tend to. Our troubles are just
beginning, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vacantly he stared after her until the door of the house closed
behind her. He could not make any thought come except that she
would not help.</p>

<p>Suddenly he was knocked back a step as Egwene cannoned into him,
throwing her arms around him. Her hug was hard enough to bring a
grunt from him any other time; now he only looked silently at the
door behind which his hopes had vanished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, Rand,&rdquo; she said against his chest. &ldquo;Light, I wish
there was something I could do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Numbly he put his arms around her. &ldquo;I know. I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I have to do
something, Egwene. I don&rsquo;t know what, but I can&rsquo;t just let him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; His voice broke, and she hugged him harder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egwene!&rdquo; At Nynaeve&rsquo;s shout from the house, Egwene jumped.
&ldquo;Egwene, I need you! And wash your hands again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She pushed herself free from Rand&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;She needs my help,
Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egwene!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He thought he heard a sob as she spun away from him. Then she
was gone, and he was left alone beside the litter. For a moment he
looked down at Tam, feeling nothing but hollow helplessness.
Suddenly his face hardened. &ldquo;The Mayor will know what to do,&rdquo; he
said, lifting the shafts once more. &ldquo;The Mayor will know.&rdquo; Bran
al&rsquo;Vere always knew what to do. With weary obstinacy he set out for
the Winespring Inn.</p>

<p>Another of the Dhurran stallions passed him, its harness straps
tied around the ankles of a big shape draped with a dirty blanket.
Arms covered with coarse hair dragged in the dirt behind the
blanket, and one corner was pushed up to reveal a goat&rsquo;s horn. The
Two Rivers was no place for stories to become horribly real. If
Trollocs belonged anywhere it was in the world outside, for places
where they had Aes Sedai and false Dragons and the Light alone knew
what else come to life out of the tales of gleemen. Not the Two
Rivers. Not Emond&rsquo;s Field.</p>

<p>As he made his way down the Green, people called to him, some
from the ruins of their homes, asking if they could help. He heard
them only as murmurs in the background, even when they walked
alongside him for a distance as they spoke. Without really thinking
about it he managed words that said he needed no help, that
everything was being taken care of. When they left him, with
worried looks, and sometimes a comment about sending Nynaeve to
him, he noticed that just as little. All he let himself be aware of
was the purpose he had fixed in his head. Bran al&rsquo;Vere could do
something to help Tam. What that could be he tried not to dwell on.
But the Mayor would be able to do something, to think of
something.</p>

<p>The inn had almost completely escaped the destruction that had
taken half the village. A few scorch marks marred its walls, but
the red roof tiles glittered in the sunlight as brightly as ever.
All that was left of the peddler&rsquo;s wagon, though, were blackened
iron wheel-rims leaning against the charred wagon box, now on the
ground. The big round hoops that had held up the canvas cover
slanted crazily, each at a different angle.</p>

<p>Thom Merrilin sat cross-legged on the old foundation stones,
carefully snipping singed edges from the patches on his cloak with
a pair of small scissors. He set down cloak and scissors when Rand
drew near. Without asking if Rand needed or wanted help, he hopped
down and picked up the back of the litter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Inside? Of course, of course. Don&rsquo;t you worry, boy. Your Wisdom
will take care of him. I&rsquo;ve watched her work, since last night, and
she has a deft touch and a sure skill. It could be a lot worse.
Some died last night. Not many, perhaps, but any at all are too
many for me. Old Fain just disappeared, and that&rsquo;s the worst of
all. Trollocs will eat anything. You should thank the Light your
father&rsquo;s still here, and alive for the Wisdom to heal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand blotted out the words&mdash;<em>He</em> is <em>my father!</em>&mdash;reducing the voice to meaningless sound that he noticed no more
than a fly&rsquo;s buzzing. He could not bear any more sympathy, any more
attempts to boost his spirits. Not now. Not until Bran al&rsquo;Vere told
him how to help Tam.</p>

<p>Suddenly he found himself facing something scrawled on the inn
door, a curving line scratched with a charred stick, a charcoal
teardrop balanced on its point. So much had happened that it hardly
surprised him to find the Dragon&rsquo;s Fang marked on the door of the
Winespring Inn. Why anyone would want to accuse the innkeeper or
his family of evil, or bring the inn bad luck, was beyond him, but
the night had convinced him of one thing. Anything was possible.
Anything at all.</p>

<p>At a push from the gleeman he lifted the latch, and went in.</p>

<p>The common room was empty except for Bran al&rsquo;Vere, and cold,
too, for no one had found time to lay a fire. The Mayor sat at one
of the tables, dipping his pen in an inkwell with a frown of
concentration on his face and his gray-fringed head bent over a
sheet of parchment. Nightshirt tucked hastily into his trousers and
bagging around his considerable waist, he absently scratched at one
bare foot with the toes of the other. His feet were dirty, as if he
had been outside more than once without bothering about boots,
despite the cold. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your trouble?&rdquo; he demanded without
looking up. &ldquo;Be quick with it. I have two dozen things to do right
this minute, and more that should have been done an hour ago. So I
have little time or patience. Well? Out with it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master al&rsquo;Vere?&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Mayor&rsquo;s head jerked up. &ldquo;Rand? Tam!&rdquo; He threw down the pen
and knocked over his chair as he leaped up. &ldquo;Perhaps the Light
hasn&rsquo;t abandoned us altogether. I was afraid you were both dead.
Bela galloped into the village an hour after the Trollocs left,
lathered and blowing as if she&rsquo;d run all the way from the farm, and
I thought&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;No time for that, now. We&rsquo;ll take him upstairs.&rdquo; He
seized the rear of the litter, shouldering the gleeman out of the
way. &ldquo;You go get the Wisdom, Master Merrilin. And tell her I said
hurry, or I&rsquo;ll know the reason why! Rest easy, Tam. We&rsquo;ll soon have
you in a good, soft bed. Go, gleeman, go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom Merrilin vanished through the doorway before Rand could
speak. &ldquo;Nynaeve wouldn&rsquo;t do anything. She said she couldn&rsquo;t help
him. I knew&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I hoped you&rsquo;d think of something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master al&rsquo;Vere
looked at Tam more sharply, then shook his head. &ldquo;We will see, boy.
We will see.&rdquo; But he no longer sounded confident. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get him
into a bed. He can rest easy, at least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand let himself be prodded toward the stairs at the back of the
common room. He tried hard to keep his certainty that somehow Tam
would be all right, but it had been thin to begin with, he
realized, and the sudden doubt in the Mayor&rsquo;s voice shook him.</p>

<p>On the second floor of the inn, at the front, were half a dozen
snug, well-appointed rooms with windows overlooking the Green.
Mostly they were used by the peddlers, or people down from Watch
Hill or up from Deven Ride, but the merchants who came each year
were often surprised to find such comfortable rooms. Three of them
were taken now, and the Mayor hurried Rand to one of the unused
ones.</p>

<p>Quickly the down comforter and blankets were stripped back on
the wide bed, and Tam was transferred to the thick feather
mattress, with goose-down pillows tucked under his head. He made no
sound beyond hoarse breathing as he was moved, not even a groan,
but the Mayor brushed away Rand&rsquo;s concern, telling him to set a
fire to take the chill off the room. While Rand dug wood and
kindling from the woodbox next to the fireplace, Bran threw back
the curtains on the window, letting in the morning light, then
began to gently wash Tam&rsquo;s face. By the time the gleeman returned,
the blaze on the hearth was warming the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She will not come,&rdquo; Thom Merrilin announced as he stalked into
the room. He glared at Rand, his bushy white brows drawing down
sharply. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t tell me she had seen him already. She almost
took my head off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;maybe the Mayor could do
something, could make her see&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Hands clenched in anxious
fists, Rand turned from the fireplace to Bran. &ldquo;Master al&rsquo;Vere,
what can I do?&rdquo; The rotund man shook his head helplessly. He laid a
freshly dampened cloth on Tam&rsquo;s forehead and avoided meeting Rand&rsquo;s
eye. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t just watch him die, Master al&rsquo;Vere. I have to do
something.&rdquo; The gleeman shifted as if to speak. Rand rounded on him
eagerly. .&rdquo;Do you have an idea? I&rsquo;ll try anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just wondering,&rdquo; Thom said, tamping his long-stemmed pipe
with his thumb, &ldquo;if the Mayor knew who scrawled the Dragon&rsquo;s Fang
on his door.&rdquo; He peered into the bowl, then looked at Tam and
replaced the unlit pipe between his teeth with a sigh. &ldquo;Someone
seems not to like him anymore. Or maybe it&rsquo;s his guests they don&rsquo;t
like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand gave him a disgusted look and turned away to stare into the
fire. His thoughts danced like the flames, and like the flames they
concentrated fixedly on one thing. He would not give up. He could
not just stand there and watch Tam die. <em>My father</em>, he thought
fiercely. <em>My father</em>. Once the fever was gone, that could be cleared
up as well. But the fever first. Only, how?</p>

<p>Bran al&rsquo;Vere&rsquo;s mouth tightened as he looked at Rand&rsquo;s back, and
the glare he directed at the gleeman would have given a bear pause,
but Thom just waited expectantly as if he had not noticed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably the work of one of the Congars, or a Coplin,&rdquo; the
Mayor said finally, &ldquo;though the Light alone knows which. They&rsquo;re a
large brood, and if there&rsquo;s ill to be said of someone, or even if
there isn&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;ll say it. They make Cenn Buie sound
honey-tongued.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That wagonload who came in just before dawn?&rdquo; the gleeman
asked. &ldquo;They hadn&rsquo;t so much as smelled a Trolloc, and all they
wanted to know was when Festival was going to start, as if they
couldn&rsquo;t see half the village in ashes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master al&rsquo;Vere nodded grimly. &ldquo;One branch of the family. But
none of them are very different. That fool Darl Coplin spent half
the night demanding I put Mistress Moiraine and Master Lan out of
the inn, out of the village, as if there would be any village at
all left without them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand had only half listened to the
conversation, but this last tugged him to speak. &ldquo;What did they do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, she called ball lightning out of a clear night sky,&rdquo;
Master al&rsquo;Vere replied. &ldquo;Sent it darting straight at the Trollocs.
You&rsquo;ve seen trees shattered by it. The Trollocs stood it no
better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moiraine?&rdquo; Rand said incredulously, and the Mayor nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mistress Moiraine. And Master Lan was a whirlwind with that
sword of his. His sword? The man himself is a weapon, and in ten
places at once, or so it seemed. Burn me, but I still wouldn&rsquo;t
believe it if I couldn&rsquo;t step outside and see&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He rubbed a
hand over his bald head. &ldquo;Winternight visits just beginning, our
hands full of presents and honeycakes and our heads fall of wine,
then the dogs snarling, and suddenly the two of them burst out of
the inn, running through the village, shouting about Trollocs. I
thought they&rsquo;d had too much wine. After all&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Trollocs? Then,
before anyone knew what was happening, those&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;those things
were right in the streets with us, slashing at people with their
swords, torching houses, howling to freeze a man&rsquo;s blood.&rdquo; He made
a sound of disgust in his throat. &ldquo;We just ran like chickens with a
fox in the henyard till Master Lan put some backbone into us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No need to be so hard,&rdquo; Thom said. &ldquo;You did as well as anyone
could. Not every Trolloc lying out there fell to the two of
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Umm&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;yes, well.&rdquo; Master al&rsquo;Vere gave himself a shake.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still almost too much to believe. An Aes Sedai in Emond&rsquo;s
Field. And Master Lan is a Warder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An Aes Sedai?&rdquo; Rand whispered. &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t be. I talked to her.
She isn&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She doesn&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you think they wore signs?&rdquo; the Mayor said wryly.
&ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;Aes Sedai&rsquo; painted across their backs, and maybe, &lsquo;Danger,
stay away&rsquo;?&rdquo; Suddenly he slapped his forehead. &ldquo;Aes Sedai. I&rsquo;m an
old fool, and losing my wits. There&rsquo;s a chance, Rand, if you&rsquo;re
willing to take it. I can&rsquo;t tell you to do it, and I don&rsquo;t know if
I&rsquo;d have the nerve, if it were me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A chance?&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take any chance, if it&rsquo;ll help&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aes Sedai can heal, Rand. Burn me, lad, you&rsquo;ve heard the
stories. They can cure where medicines fail. Gleeman, you should
have remembered that better than I. Gleemen&rsquo;s tales are full of Aes
Sedai. Why didn&rsquo;t you speak up, instead of letting me flail
around?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a stranger here,&rdquo; Thom said, looking longingly at his unlit
pipe, &ldquo;and Goodman Coplin isn&rsquo;t the only one who wants nothing to
do with Aes Sedai. Best the idea came from you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Rand muttered, trying to make the woman who had
smiled at him fit the stories. Help from an Aes Sedai was sometimes
worse than no help at all, so the stories said, like poison in a
pie, and their gifts always had a hook in them, like fishbait.
Suddenly the coin in his pocket, the coin Moiraine had given him,
seemed like a burning coal. It was all he could do not to rip it
out of his coat and throw it out the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody wants to get involved with Aes Sedai, lad,&rdquo; the Mayor
said slowly. &ldquo;It is the only chance I can see, but it&rsquo;s still no
small decision. I cannot make it for you, but I have seen nothing
but good from Mistress Moiraine&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Moiraine Sedai, I should call
her, I suppose. Sometimes&rdquo;&mdash;he gave a meaningful took at Tam&mdash;&ldquo;you have to take a chance, even if it&rsquo;s a poor one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of the stories are exaggerated, in a way,&rdquo; Thom added, as
if the words were being dragged from him. &ldquo;Some of them. Besides,
boy, what choice do you have?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; Rand sighed. Tam still had not moved a muscle; his eyes
were sunken as if he had been sick a week. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll go find
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The other side of the bridges,&rdquo; the gleeman said, &ldquo;where they
are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;disposing of the dead Trollocs. But be careful, boy. Aes
Sedai do what they do for reasons of their own, and they aren&rsquo;t
always the reasons others think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The last was a shout that followed Rand through the door. He had
to hold onto the sword hilt to keep the scabbard from tangling in
his legs as he ran, but he would not take the time to remove it. He
clattered down the stairs and dashed out of the inn, tiredness
forgotten for the moment. A chance for Tam, however small, was
enough to overcome a night without sleep, for a time at least. That
the chance came from an Aes Sedai, or what the price of it might
be, he did not want to consider. And as for actually facing an Aes
Sedai&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He took a deep breath and tried to move faster.</p>

<p>The
bonfires stood well beyond the last houses to the north, on the
Westwood side of the road to Watch Hill. The wind still carried the
oily black columns of smoke away from the village, but even so a
sickly sweet stink filled the air, like a roast left hours too long
on the spit. Rand gagged at the smell, then swallowed hard when he
realized its source. A fine thing to do with Bel Tine fires. The
men tending the fires had cloths tied over their noses and mouths,
but their grimaces made it plain the vinegar dampening the cloths
was not enough. Even if it did kill the stench, they still knew the
stench was there, and they still knew what they were doing.</p>

<p>Two of
the men were untying the harness straps of one of the big Dhurrans
from a Trolloc&rsquo;s ankles. Lan, squatting beside the body, had tossed
back the blanket enough to reveal the Trolloc&rsquo;s shoulders and
goat-snouted head. As Rand trotted up, the Warder unfastened a
metal badge, a blood-red enamelled trident, from one spiked
shoulder of the Trolloc&rsquo;s shirt of black mail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ko&rsquo;bal,&rdquo; he announced. He bounced the badge on his palm and
snatched it out of the air with a growl. &ldquo;That makes seven bands so
far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine, seated cross-legged on the ground a short distance
off, shook her head tiredly. A walking staff, covered from end to
end in carved vines and flowers, lay across her knees, and her
dress had the rumpled look of having been worn too long. &ldquo;Seven
bands. Seven! That many have not acted together since the Trolloc
Wars. Bad news piles on bad news. I am afraid, Lan. I thought we
had gained a march, but we may be further behind than ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stared at her, unable to speak. An Aes Sedai. He had been
trying to convince himself that she would not look any different
now that he knew whom&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;what he was looking at, and to his
surprise she did not. She was no longer quite so pristine, not with
wisps of her hair sticking out in all directions and a faint streak
of soot across her nose, yet not really different, either. Surely
there must be something about an Aes Sedai to mark her for what she
was. On the other hand, if outward appearance reflected what was
inside, and if the stories were true, then she should look closer
to a Trolloc than to a more than handsome woman whose dignity was
not dented by sitting in the dirt. And she could help Tam. Whatever
the cost, there was that before anything else. He took a deep
breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mistress Moiraine&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I mean, Moiraine Sedai.&rdquo; Both turned to
look at him, and he froze under her gaze. Not the calm, smiling
gaze he remembered from the Green. Her face was tired, but her dark
eyes were a hawk&rsquo;s eyes. Aes Sedai. Breakers of the world.
Puppeteers who pulled strings and made thrones and nations dance in
designs only the women from Tar Valon knew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little more light in the darkness,&rdquo; the Aes Sedai murmured.
She raised her voice. &ldquo;How are your dreams, Rand al&rsquo;Thor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stared at her. &ldquo;My dreams?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A night like that can give a man bad dreams, Rand. If you have
nightmares, you must tell me of it. I can help with bad dreams,
sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with my&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s my father. He&rsquo;s hurt.
It&rsquo;s not much more than a scratch, but the fever is burning him up.
The Wisdom won&rsquo;t help. She says she can&rsquo;t. But the stories&mdash;&rdquo;
She raised an eyebrow, and he stopped and swallowed hard. <em>Light</em>, is
<em>there a story with an Aes Sedai where she isn&rsquo;t a villain?</em> He
looked at the Warder, but Lan appeared more interested in the dead
Trolloc than in anything Rand might say. Fumbling his way under her
eyes, he went on. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;it&rsquo;s said Aes Sedai can heal.
If you can help him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;anything you can do for him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;whatever the cost&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He took a deep breath and
finished up in a rush. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay any price in my power if you help
him. Anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any price,&rdquo; Moiraine mused, half to herself. &ldquo;We will speak of
prices later, Rand, if at all. I can make no promises. Your Wisdom
knows what she is about. I will do what I can, but it is beyond my
power to stop the Wheel from turning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Death comes sooner or later to everyone,&rdquo; the Warder said
grimly, &ldquo;unless they serve the Dark One, and only fools are willing
to pay that price.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine made a clucking sound. &ldquo;Do not be so gloomy, Lan. We
have some reason to celebrate. A small one, but a reason.&rdquo; She used
the staff to pull herself to her feet. &ldquo;Take me to your father,
Rand. I will help him as much as I am able. Too many here have
refused to let me help at all. They have heard the stories, too,&rdquo;
she added dryly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s at the inn,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;This way. And thank you. Thank
you!&rdquo; They followed, but his pace took him quickly ahead. He slowed
impatiently for them to catch up, then darted ahead again and had
to wait again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please hurry,&rdquo; he urged, so caught up in actually getting help
for Tam that he never considered the temerity of prodding an Aes
Sedai. &ldquo;The fever is burning him up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan glared at him. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see she&rsquo;s tired? Even with an
<em>angreal</em>, what she did last night was like running around the
village with a sack of stones on her back. I don&rsquo;t know that you
are worth it, sheepherder, no matter what she says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand blinked
and held his tongue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gently, my friend,&rdquo; Moiraine said. Without slowing her pace,
she reached up to pat the Warder&rsquo;s shoulder. He towered over her
protectively, as if he could give her strength just by being close.
&ldquo;You think only of taking care of me. Why should he not think the
same of his father?&rdquo; Lan scowled, but fell silent. &ldquo;I am coming as
quickly as I can, Rand, I promise you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fierceness of her eyes, or the calm of her voice&mdash;not
gentle, exactly; more firmly in command&mdash;Rand did not know
which to believe. Or perhaps they did go together. Aes Sedai. He
was committed, now. He matched his stride to theirs, and tried not
to think of what the price might be that they would talk about
later.</p>
