<h4><em>Old Friends, and New Threats</em></h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">B</span>ack
at The Queen&rsquo;s Blessing, Rand threw himself
against the front doorframe, panting. He had run all the way, not
caring if anyone saw that he wore the red, or even if they took his
running as an excuse to chase him. He did not think even a Fade
could have caught him.</p>

<p>Lamgwin was sitting on a bench by the door, a brindle
cat in his arms, when he came running up. The man stood to look for
trouble the way Rand had come, still calmly scratching behind the
cat&rsquo;s ears. Seeing nothing, he sat back down again, careful not to
disturb the animal. &ldquo;Fools tried to steal some of the cats a while
back,&rdquo; he said. He examined his knuckles before going back to his
scratching. &ldquo;Good money in cats these days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two men showing the white were still across the
way, Rand saw, one with a black eye and a swollen jaw. That one
wore a sour scowl and rubbed his sword hilt with a sullen eagerness
as he watched the inn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Master Gill?&rdquo; Rand asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Library,&rdquo; Lamgwin replied. The cat began purring,
and he grinned. &ldquo;Nothing bothers a cat for long, not even somebody
trying to stick him in a sack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand hurried inside, through the common room, now
with its usual complement of men wearing the red and talking over
their ale. About the false Dragon, and whether the Whitecloaks
would make trouble when he was taken north. No one cared what
happened to Logain, but they all knew the Daughter-Heir and Lord
Gawyn would be traveling in the party, and no man there would
countenance any risk to them.</p>

<p>He found Master Gill in the library, playing stones
with Loial. A plump tabby sat on the table, feet tucked under her,
watching their hands move over the cross-hatched board.</p>

<p>The Ogier placed another stone with a touch oddly
delicate for his thick fingers. Shaking his head, Master Gill took
the excuse of Rand&rsquo;s appearance to turn from the table. Loial
almost always won at stones. &ldquo;I was beginning to worry where you
were, lad. Thought you might have had trouble with some of those
white-flashing traitors, or run into that beggar or something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a minute Rand stood there with his mouth open. He
had forgotten all about that bundle-of-rags of a man. &ldquo;I saw him,&rdquo;
he said finally, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s nothing. I saw the Queen, too, and
Elaida; that&rsquo;s where the trouble is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master Gill snorted a laugh. &ldquo;The Queen, eh? You
don&rsquo;t say. We had Gareth Bryne out in the common room an hour or so
ago, arm-wrestling the Lord Captain-Commander of the Children, but
the Queen, now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that&rsquo;s something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blood and ashes,&rdquo; Rand growled, &ldquo;everybody thinks
I&rsquo;m lying today.&rdquo; He tossed his cloak across the back of a chair
and threw himself onto another. He was too wound up to sit back. He
perched on the front edge, mopping his face with a handkerchief. &ldquo;I
saw the beggar, and he saw me, and I thought&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;That&rsquo;s not
important. I climbed up on a wall around a garden, where I could
see the plaza in front of the Palace, where they took Logain in.
And I fell off, on the inside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I almost believe you aren&rsquo;t making fun,&rdquo; the
innkeeper said slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Ta&rsquo;veren</em>,&rdquo; Loial murmured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it happened,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;Light help me, it
did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master Gill&rsquo;s skepticism melted slowly as he went on,
turning to quiet alarm. The innkeeper leaned more and more forward
until he was perched on the edge of his chair the same as Rand was.
Loial listened impassively, except that every so often he rubbed
his broad nose and the tufts on his ears gave a little twitch.</p>

<p>Rand told everything that had happened, everything
except what Elaida had whispered to him. And what Gawyn had said at
the Palace gate. One he did not want to think about; the other had
nothing to do with anything. <em>I&rsquo;m Tam al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s son, even if I
wasn&rsquo;t born in the Two Rivers. I am! I&rsquo;m Two Rivers blood, and Tam
is my father</em>.</p>

<p>Abruptly he realized he had stopped talking, caught
up in his thoughts, and they were looking at him. For one panicky
moment he wondered if he had said too much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Master Gill said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no more waiting
for your friends for you. You will have to leave the city, and
fast. Two days at the most. Can you get Mat on his feet in that
time, or should I send for Mother Grubb?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand gave him a perplexed look. &ldquo;Two days?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elaida is Queen Morgase&rsquo;s advisor, right next to
Captain-General Gareth Bryne himself. Maybe ahead of him. If she
sets the Queen&rsquo;s Guards looking for you&mdash;Lord Gareth won&rsquo;t
stop her unless she interferes with their other duties&mdash;well,
the Guards can search every inn in Caemlyn in two days. And that&rsquo;s
saying some ill chance doesn&rsquo;t bring them here the first day, or
the first hour. Maybe there&rsquo;s a little time if they start over at
the Crown and Lion, but none for dawdling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand nodded slowly. &ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t get Mat out of that
bed, you send for Mother Grubb. I have a little money left. Maybe
enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of Mother Grubb,&rdquo; the innkeeper said
gruffly. &ldquo;And I suppose I can lend you a couple of horses. You try
walking to Tar Valon and you&rsquo;ll wear through what&rsquo;s left of your
boots halfway there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good friend,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;It seems like
we&rsquo;ve brought you nothing but trouble, but you&rsquo;re still willing to
help. A good friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master Gill seemed embarrassed. He shrugged his
shoulders and cleared his throat and looked down. That brought his
eyes to the stones board, and he jerked them away again. Loial was
definitely winning. &ldquo;Aye, well, Thom&rsquo;s always been a good friend to
me. If he&rsquo;s willing to go out of his way for you, I can do a little
bit, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like to go with you when you leave, Rand,&rdquo;
Loial said suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought that was settled, Loial.&rdquo; He hesitated&mdash;Master Gill still did not know the whole of the danger&mdash;then added, &ldquo;You know what waits for Mat and me, what&rsquo;s
chasing us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Darkfriends,&rdquo; the Ogier replied in a placid rumble,
&ldquo;and Aes Sedai, and the Light knows what else. Or the Dark One. You
are going to Tar Valon, and there is a very fine grove there, which
I have heard the Aes Sedai tend well. In any case, there is more to
see in the world than the groves. You truly are <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>,
Rand. The Pattern weaves itself around you, and you stand in the
heart of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>This man stands at the heart of it</em>. Rand
felt a chill. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t stand at the heart of anything,&rdquo; he said
harshly.</p>

<p>Master Gill blinked, and even Loial seemed taken
aback at his anger. The innkeeper and the Ogier looked at each
other, and then at the floor. Rand forced his expression smooth,
drawing deep breaths. For a wonder he found the void that had
eluded him so often of late, and calmness. They did not deserve his
anger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can come, Loial,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why you
would want to, but I&rsquo;d be grateful for the company. You&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;you
know how Mat is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Loial said. &ldquo;I still cannot go into the
streets without raising a mob shouting &lsquo;Trolloc&rsquo; after me. But Mat,
at least, only uses words. He has not tried to kill me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;Not Mat.&rdquo; <em>He
wouldn&rsquo;t go that far. Not Mat</em>.</p>

<p>A tap came at the door, and one of the serving maids,
Gilda, stuck her head into the room. Her mouth was tight, and her
eyes worried. &ldquo;Master Gill, come quickly, please. There&rsquo;s
Whitecloaks in the common room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master Gill leaped up with an oath, sending the cat
jumping from the table to stalk out of the room, tail stiff and
offended. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come. Run tell them I&rsquo;m coming, then stay out of
their way. You hear me, girl? Keep away from them.&rdquo; Gilda bobbed
her head and vanished. &ldquo;You had best stay here,&rdquo; he told Loial.</p>

<p>The Ogier snorted, a sound like sheets ripping. &ldquo;I
have no desire for any more meetings with the Children of the
Light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master Gill&rsquo;s eye fell on the stones board and his
mood seemed to lighten. &ldquo;It looks as if we&rsquo;ll have to start the
game over later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No need for that.&rdquo; Loial stretched an arm to the
shelves and took down a book; his hands dwarfed the clothbound
volume. &ldquo;We can take up from where the board lies. It is your
turn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master Gill grimaced. &ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t one thing, it&rsquo;s
another,&rdquo; he muttered as he hurried from the room.</p>

<p>Rand followed him, but slowly. He had no more desire
than Loial to become involved with the Children. <em>This man
stands at the heart of it</em>. He stopped at the door to the
common room, where he could see what went on, but far enough back
that he hoped he would not be noticed.</p>

<p>Dead silence filled the room. Five Whitecloaks stood
in the middle of the floor, studiously being ignored by the folk at
the tables. One of them had the silver lightning-flash of an
under-officer beneath the sunburst on his cloak. Lamgwin was
lounging against the wall by the front door, intently cleaning his
fingernails with a splinter. Four more of the guards Master Gill
had hired were spaced across the wall with him, all industriously
paying no attention at all to the Whitecloaks. If the Children of
the Light noticed anything, they gave no sign. Only the
under-officer showed any emotion at all, impatiently tapping his
steel-backed gauntlets against his palm as he waited for the
innkeeper.</p>

<p>Master Gill crossed the room to him quickly, a
cautiously neutral look on his face. &ldquo;The Light illumine you,&rdquo; he
said with a careful bow, not too deep, but not slight enough to
actually be insulting, either, &ldquo;and our good Queen Morgase. How may
I help&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no time for your drivel, innkeeper,&rdquo; the
under-officer snapped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been to twenty inns already today,
each a worse pigsty than the last, and I&rsquo;ll see twenty more before
the sun sets. I&rsquo;m looking for Darkfriends, a boy from the Two
Rivers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master Gill&rsquo;s face grew darker with every word. He
puffed up as if he would explode, and finally he did, cutting the
Whitecloak off in turn. &ldquo;There are no Darkfriends in my
establishment! Every man here is a good Queen&rsquo;s man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and we all know where Morgase stands,&rdquo; the
under-officer twisted the Queen&rsquo;s name into a sneer, &ldquo;and her Tar
Valon witch, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The scrape of chair legs was loud. Suddenly every man
in the room was on his feet. They stood still as statues, but every
one staring grimly at the Whitecloaks. The under-officer did not
appear to notice, but the four behind him looked around
uneasily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will go easier with you, innkeeper,&rdquo; the
under-officer said, &ldquo;if you cooperate. The temper of the times goes
hard with those who shelter Darkfriends. I wouldn&rsquo;t think an inn
with the Dragon&rsquo;s Fang on its door would get much custom. Might
have trouble with fire, with that on your door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You get out of here now,&rdquo; Master Gill said quietly,
&ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll send for the Queen&rsquo;s Guards to cart what&rsquo;s left of you to
the middens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lamgwin&rsquo;s sword rasped out of its sheath, and the
coarse scrape of steel on leather was repeated throughout the room
as swords and daggers filled hands. Serving maids scurried for the
doors.</p>

<p>The under-officer looked around in scornful
disbelief. &ldquo;The Dragon&rsquo;s Fang&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t help you five,&rdquo; Master Gill finished for him.
He held up a clenched fist and raised his forefinger. &ldquo;One.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be mad, innkeeper, threatening the Children
of the Light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whitecloaks hold no writ in Caemlyn. Two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you really believe this will end here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back,&rdquo; the under-officer snapped, and then
he was hastily turning his men around, trying to pretend he was
leaving in good order and in his own time. He was hampered in this
by the eagerness his men showed for the door, not running, but not
making secret that they wanted to be outside.</p>

<p>Lamgwin stood across the door with his sword, only
giving way in response to Master Gill&rsquo;s frantic waves. When the
Whitecloaks were gone, the innkeeper dropped heavily onto a chair.
He rubbed a hand across his forehead, then stared at it as if
surprised that it was not covered with sweat. All over the room men
seated themselves again, laughing over what they had done. Some
went over to clap Master Gill on the shoulder.</p>

<p>When he saw Rand, the innkeeper tottered off the
chair and over to him. &ldquo;Who would have thought I had it in me to be
a hero?&rdquo; he said wonderingly. &ldquo;The Light illumine me.&rdquo; Abruptly he
gave himself a shake, and his voice regained almost its normal
tone. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to stay out of sight until I can get you out of
the city.&rdquo; With a careful look back into the common room, he pushed
Rand deeper into the hall. &ldquo;That lot will be back, or else a few
spies wearing red for the day. After that little show I put on, I
doubt they&rsquo;ll care whether you&rsquo;re here or not, but they&rsquo;ll act as
though you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s crazy,&rdquo; Rand protested. At the innkeeper&rsquo;s
gesture he lowered his voice. &ldquo;The Whitecloaks don&rsquo;t have any
reason to be after me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about reasons, lad, but they&rsquo;re after
you and Mat for certain sure. What <em>have</em> you been up to?
Elaida <em>and</em> the Whitecloaks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand raised his hands in protest, then let them fall.
It made no sense, but he had heard the Whitecloak. &ldquo;What about you?
The Whitecloaks will make trouble for you even when they don&rsquo;t find
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No worries about that, lad. The Queen&rsquo;s Guards still
uphold the law, even if they do let traitors strut around showing
white. As for the night&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well, Lamgwin and his friends might
not get much sleep, but I could almost pity anybody who tries to
put a mark on my door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gilda appeared beside them, dropping a curtsy to
Master Gill. &ldquo;Sir, there&rsquo;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;there&rsquo;s a lady. In the kitchens.&rdquo;
She sounded scandalized at the combination. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s asking for
Master Rand, sir, and Master Mat, by name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand exchanged a puzzled look with the innkeeper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lad,&rdquo; Master Gill said, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ve actually managed
to bring the Lady Elayne down from the Palace to my inn, we&rsquo;ll all
end up facing the headsman.&rdquo; Gilda squeaked at the mention of the
Daughter-Heir and gave Rand a round-eyed stare. &ldquo;Off with you,
girl,&rdquo; the innkeeper said sharply. &ldquo;And keep quiet about what
you&rsquo;ve heard. It&rsquo;s nobody&rsquo;s business.&rdquo; Gilda bobbed again and
darted down the hallway, flashing glances over her shoulder at Rand
as she went. &ldquo;In five minutes&rdquo;&mdash;Master Gill sighed&mdash;&ldquo;she will be telling the other women you&rsquo;re a prince in disguise.
By nightfall it will be all over the New City.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Gill,&rdquo; Rand said, &ldquo;I never mentioned Mat to
Elayne. It can&rsquo;t be&mdash;&rdquo; Suddenly a huge smile lit up his face,
and he ran for the kitchens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; the innkeeper called behind him. &ldquo;Wait until
you know. Wait, you fool!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand threw open the door to the kitchens, and there
they were.</p>

<p>Moiraine rested her serene eyes on him, unsurprised.
Nynaeve and Egwene ran laughing to throw their arms around him,
with Perrin crowding in behind them, all three patting his
shoulders as if they had to be convinced that he was really there.
In the doorway leading to the stableyard Lan lounged with one boot
up on the doorframe, dividing his attention between the kitchen and
the yard outside.</p>

<p>Rand tried to hug the two women and shake Perrin&rsquo;s
hand, all at the same time, and it was a tangle of arms and
laughter complicated by Nynaeve trying to feel his face for fever.
They looked somewhat the worse for wear&mdash;bruises on Perrin&rsquo;s face,
and he had a way of keeping his eyes downcast that he had never had
before&mdash;but they were alive, and together again. His throat
was so tight he could barely talk. &ldquo;I was afraid I&rsquo;d never see you
again,&rdquo; he managed finally. &ldquo;I was afraid you were all&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew you were alive,&rdquo; Egwene said against his
chest. &ldquo;I always knew it. Always.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. Her voice was sharp for
just that moment, but it softened in the next, and she smiled up at
him. &ldquo;You look well, Rand. Not overfed by any means, but well,
thank the Light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Master Gill said behind him, &ldquo;I guess you
know these people after all. Those friends you were looking
for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand nodded. &ldquo;Yes, my friends.&rdquo; He made introductions
all around; it still felt odd to be giving Lan and Moiraine their
right names. They both eyed him sharply when he did.</p>

<p>The innkeeper greeted everyone with an open smile,
but he was properly impressed at meeting a Warder, and especially
at Moiraine. At her he gaped openly&mdash;it was one thing knowing
an Aes Sedai had been helping the boys, quite something else having
her appear in the kitchen&mdash;then bowed deeply. &ldquo;You are
welcome to The Queen&rsquo;s Blessing, Aes Sedai, as my guest. Though I
suppose you will be staying at the Palace with Elaida Sedai, and
the Aes Sedai who came with the false Dragon.&rdquo; Bowing again, he
gave Rand a quick, worried look. It was all very well to say he did
not speak ill of Aes Sedai, but that was not the same as saying he
wanted one sleeping under his roof.</p>

<p>Rand nodded encouragingly, trying to tell him
silently that it was all right. Moiraine was not like Elaida, with
a threat hidden behind every glance, under every word. <em>Are you
sure? Even now, are you sure?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe I will stay here,&rdquo; Moiraine said, &ldquo;for the
short time I remain in Caemlyn. And you must allow me to pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A calico cat sauntered in from the hallway to strop
the innkeeper&rsquo;s ankles. No sooner had the calico begun than a fuzzy
gray sprang from under the table, arching its back and hissing. The
calico crouched with a threatening growl, and the gray streaked
past Lan into the stableyard.</p>

<p>Master Gill began apologizing for the cats at the
same time he protested that Moiraine would honor him by being his
guest, and was she sure she would not prefer the Palace, which he
would quite understand, but he hoped she would accept his best room
as a gift. It made a jumble to which Moiraine seemed to pay no
attention at all. Instead she bent down to scratch the
orange-and-white cat; it promptly left Master Gill&rsquo;s ankles for
hers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen four other cats here, so far,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;You have a problem with mice? Rats?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rats, Moiraine Sedai.&rdquo; The innkeeper sighed. &ldquo;A
terrible problem. Not that I don&rsquo;t keep a clean place, you
understand. It&rsquo;s all the people. The whole city is full of people
and rats. But my cats take care of it. You&rsquo;ll not be troubled, I
promise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand exchanged a fleeting look with Perrin, who put
his eyes down again right away. There was something odd about
Perrin&rsquo;s eyes. And he was so silent; Perrin was almost always slow
to speak, but now he was saying nothing at all. &ldquo;It could be all
the people,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With your permission, Master Gill,&rdquo; Moiraine said,
as if she took it for granted. &ldquo;It is a simple matter to keep rats
away from this street. With luck, the rats will not even realize
they are being kept away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master Gill frowned at that last, but he bowed,
accepting her offer. &ldquo;If you are sure you don&rsquo;t want to stay at the
Palace, Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Mat?&rdquo; Nynaeve said suddenly. &ldquo;<em>She</em>
said he was here, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upstairs,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;not feeling
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s head came up. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s sick? I&rsquo;ll leave the
rats to <em>her</em>, and I&rsquo;ll attend to him. Take me to him now,
Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All of you go up,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;I will join you
in a few minutes. We are crowding Master Gill&rsquo;s kitchen, and it
would be best if we could all be somewhere quiet for a time.&rdquo; There
was an undercurrent in her voice. <em>Stay out of sight. The hiding
is not done yet</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go up the back way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Emond&rsquo;s Field folk crowded after him to the back
staircase, leaving the Aes Sedai and the Warder in the kitchen with
Master Gill. He could not get over being back together. It was
nearly as if he were home again. He could not stop grinning.</p>

<p>The same relief, almost joyous, seemed to be
affecting the others. They chuckled to themselves, and kept
reaching out to grip his arm. Perrin&rsquo;s voice seemed subdued, and he
still kept his head down, but he began to talk as they climbed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moiraine said she could find you and Mat, and she
did. When we rode into the city, the rest of us couldn&rsquo;t stop
staring&mdash;well, all except Lan, of course&mdash;all the
people, the buildings, everything.&rdquo; His thick curls swung as he
shook his head in disbelief. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all so big. And so many people.
Some of them kept staring at us, too, shouting &lsquo;Red or white?&rsquo; like
it made some kind of sense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene touched Rand&rsquo;s sword, fingering the red
wrappings. &ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Nothing important. We&rsquo;re leaving
for Tar Valon, remember?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene gave him a look, but she removed her hand from
the sword and took up where Perrin had left off. &ldquo;Moiraine didn&rsquo;t
look at anything any more than Lan did. She led us back and forth
through all those streets so many times, like a dog hunting a
scent, that I thought you couldn&rsquo;t be here. Then, all of a sudden,
she took off down a street, and the next thing I knew we were
handing the horses to the stablemen and marching into the kitchen.
She never even asked if you were here. Just told a woman who was
mixing batter to go tell Rand al&rsquo;Thor and Mat Cauthon that someone
wanted to see them. And there you were&rdquo;&mdash;she grinned&mdash;&ldquo;like a ball popping into the gleeman&rsquo;s hand out of
nowhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is the gleeman?&rdquo; Perrin asked. &ldquo;Is he with
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s stomach lurched and the good feeling of having
friends around him dimmed. &ldquo;Thom&rsquo;s dead. I think he&rsquo;s dead. There
was a Fade&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He could not say any more. Nynaeve shook her
head, muttering under her breath.</p>

<p>The silence thickened around them, stifling the
little chuckles, flattening the joy, until they reached the head of
the stairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat&rsquo;s not sick, exactly,&rdquo; he said then. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo; He flung open the door to the room he shared with Mat.
&ldquo;Look who&rsquo;s here, Mat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat was still curled up in a ball on the bed, just as
Rand had left him. He raised his head to stare at them. &ldquo;How do you
know they&rsquo;re really who they look like?&rdquo; he said hoarsely. His face
was flushed, the skin tight and slick with sweat. &ldquo;How do I know
you&rsquo;re who you look like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not sick?&rdquo; Nynaeve gave Rand a disdainful look as
she pushed past him, already unslinging her bag from her
shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everybody changes,&rdquo; Mat rasped. &ldquo;How can I be sure?
Perrin? Is that you? You&rsquo;ve changed, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; His laugh
sounded more like a cough. &ldquo;Oh, yes, you&rsquo;ve changed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To Rand&rsquo;s surprise Perrin dropped onto the edge of
the other bed with his head in hands, staring at the floor. Mat&rsquo;s
hacking laughter seemed to pierce him.</p>

<p>Nynaeve knelt beside Mat&rsquo;s bed and put a hand to his face,
pushing up his headcloth. He jerked back from her with a scornful
look. His eyes were bright and glazed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re burning,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;but you should not be sweating with this much fever.&rdquo; She could
not keep the worry out of her voice. &ldquo;Rand, you and Perrin fetch
some clean cloths and as much cool water as you can carry. I&rsquo;ll
bring your temperature down first, Mat, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty Nynaeve,&rdquo; Mat spat. &ldquo;A Wisdom isn&rsquo;t supposed
to think of herself as a woman, is she? Not a pretty woman. But you
do, don&rsquo;t you? Now. You can&rsquo;t make yourself forget that you&rsquo;re a
pretty woman, now, and it frightens you. Everybody changes.&rdquo;
Nynaeve&rsquo;s face paled as he spoke, whether with anger or something
else, Rand could not tell. Mat gave a sly laugh, and his feverish
eyes slid to Egwene. &ldquo;Pretty Egwene,&rdquo; he croaked. &ldquo;Pretty as
Nynaeve. And you share other things now, don&rsquo;t you? Other dreams.
What do you dream about now?&rdquo; Egwene took a step back from the
bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are safe from the Dark One&rsquo;s eyes for the time
being,&rdquo; Moiraine announced as she walked into the room with Lan at
her heels. Her eyes fell on Mat as she stepped through the doorway,
and she hissed as if she had touched a hot stove. &ldquo;Get away from
him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve did not move except for turning to stare at
the Aes Sedai in surprise. In two quick steps Moiraine seized the
Wisdom by the shoulders, hauling her across the floor like a sack
of grain. Nynaeve struggled and protested, but Moiraine did not
release her until she was well away from the bed. The Wisdom
continued her protests as she got to her feet, angrily
straightening her clothes, but Moiraine ignored her completely. The
Aes Sedai watched Mat to the exclusion of everything else, eyeing
him the way she would a viper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All of you stay away from him,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And be
quiet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat stared back as intently as she. He bared his
teeth in a silent, snarling rictus, and pulled himself into an ever
tighter knot, but he never took his eyes from hers. Slowly she put
one hand on him, lightly, on a knee drawn up to his chest. A
convulsion shook him at her touch, a shudder of revulsion spasming
through his entire body, and abruptly he pulled one hand out,
slashing at her face with the ruby-hilted dagger.</p>

<p>One minute Lan was in the doorway, the next he was at
the bedside, as if he had not bothered with the intervening space.
His hand caught Mat&rsquo;s wrist, stopping the slash as if it had struck
stone. Still Mat held himself in that tight ball. Only the hand
with the dagger tried to move, straining against the Warder&rsquo;s
implacable grip. Mat&rsquo;s eyes never left Moiraine, and they burned
with hate.</p>

<p>Moiraine also did not move. She did not flinch from
the blade only inches from her face, as she had not when he first
struck. &ldquo;How did he come by this?&rdquo; she asked in a steel voice. &ldquo;I
asked if Mordeth had given you anything. I asked, and I warned you,
and you said he had not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;He&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Mat took it from
the treasure room.&rdquo; Moiraine looked at him, her eyes seeming to
burn as much as Mat&rsquo;s. He almost stepped back before she turned
away again, back to the bed. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know until after we were
separated. I didn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not know.&rdquo; Moiraine studied Mat. He still
lay with his knees pulled up to his chest, still snarled
soundlessly at her, and his hand yet fought Lan to reach her with
the dagger. &ldquo;It is a wonder you got this far, carrying this. I felt
the evil of it when I laid eyes on him, the touch of Mashadar, but
a Fade could sense it for miles. Even though he would not know
exactly where, he would know it was near, and Mashadar would draw
his spirit while his bones remembered that this same evil swallowed
an army&mdash;Dreadlords, Fades, Trollocs, and all. Some
Darkfriends could probably feel it, too. Those who have truly given
away their souls. There could not help but be those who would
wonder at suddenly feeling this, as if the very air around them
itched. They would be compelled to seek it. It should have drawn
them to it as a magnet draws iron filings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There were Darkfriends,&rdquo; Rand said, &ldquo;more than once,
but we got away from them. And a Fade, the night before we reached
Caemlyn, but he never saw us.&rdquo; He cleared his throat. &ldquo;There are
rumors of strange things in the night outside the city. It could be
Trollocs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s Trollocs, sheepherder,&rdquo; Lan said wryly.
&ldquo;And where Trollocs are, there are Fades.&rdquo; Tendons stood out on the
back of his hand from the effort of holding Mat&rsquo;s wrist, but there
was no strain in his voice. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve tried to hide their passage,
but I have seen sign for two days. And heard farmers and villagers
mutter about things in the night. The Myrddraal managed to strike
into the Two Rivers unseen, somehow, but every day they come closer
to those who can send soldiers to hunt them down. Even so, they
won&rsquo;t stop now, sheepherder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re in Caemlyn,&rdquo; Egwene said. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t get
to us as long as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t?&rdquo; the Warder cut her off. &ldquo;The Fades are
building their numbers in the countryside. That&rsquo;s plain enough from
the sign, if you know what to look for. Already there are more
Trollocs than they need just to watch all the ways out of the city,
a dozen fists, at least. There can only be one reason; when the
Fades have enough numbers, they will come into the city after you.
That act may send half the armies of the south marching to the
Borderlands, but the evidence is that they&rsquo;re willing to take that
risk. You three have escaped them too long. It looks as if you&rsquo;ve
brought a new Trolloc War to Caemlyn, sheepherder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene gave a gasping sob, and Perrin shook his head
as though to deny it. Rand felt a sickness in his stomach at the
thought of Trollocs in the streets of Caemlyn. All those people at
one another&rsquo;s throats, never realizing the real threat waiting to
come over the walls. What would they do when they suddenly found
Trollocs and Fades in their midst, killing them? He could see the
towers burning, flames breaking through the domes, Trollocs
pillaging through the curving streets and vistas of the Inner City.
The Palace itself in flames. Elayne, and Gawyn, and Morgase&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; Moiraine said absently. She was still
intent on Mat. &ldquo;If we can find a way out of Caemlyn, the Halfmen
will have no more interest here. If. So many if&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better we were all dead,&rdquo; Perrin said suddenly, and
Rand jumped at the echo of his own thoughts. Perrin still sat
staring at the floor&mdash;glaring at it now&mdash;and his voice was
bitter. &ldquo;Everywhere we go, we bring pain and suffering on our
backs. It would be better for everyone if we were dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve rounded on him, her face half fury and half
worried fear, but Moiraine forestalled her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think to gain, for yourself or anyone
else, by dying?&rdquo; the Aes Sedai asked. Her voice was level, yet
sharp. &ldquo;If the Lord of the Grave has gained as much freedom to
touch the Pattern as I fear, he can reach you dead more easily than
alive, now. Dead, you can help no one, not the people who have
helped you, not your friends and family back in the Two Rivers. The
Shadow is falling over the world, and none of you can stop it
dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin raised his head to look at her, and Rand gave
a start. The irises of his friend&rsquo;s eyes were more yellow than
brown. With his shaggy hair and the intensity of his gaze, there
was something about him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Rand could not grasp it enough to
make it out.</p>

<p>Perrin spoke with a soft flatness that gave his words
more weight than if he had shouted. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stop it alive,
either, now can we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will have time to argue with you later,&rdquo; Moiraine
said, &ldquo;but your friend needs me now.&rdquo; She stepped aside so they
could all see Mat clearly. His eyes still on her with a rage-filled
stare, he had not moved or changed his position on the bed. Sweat
stood out on his face, and his lips were bloodless in an unchanging
snarl. All of his strength seemed to be pouring into the effort to
reach Moiraine with the dagger Lan held motionless. &ldquo;Or had you
forgotten?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin gave an embarrassed shrug and spread his hands
wordlessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with him?&rdquo; Egwene asked, and Nynaeve
added, &ldquo;Is it catching? I can still treat him. I don&rsquo;t seem to
catch sick, no matter what it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is catching,&rdquo; Moiraine said, &ldquo;and your&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;protection would not save you.&rdquo; She pointed to the ruby-hilted
dagger, careful not to let her finger touch it. The blade trembled
as Mat strained to reach her with it. &ldquo;This is from Shadar Logoth.
There is not a pebble of that city that is not tainted and
dangerous to bring outside the walls, and this is far more than a
pebble. The evil that killed Shadar Logoth is in it, and in Mat,
too, now. Suspicion and hatred so strong that even those closest
are seen as enemies, rooted so deep in the bone that eventually the
only thought left is to kill. By carrying the dagger beyond the
walls of Shadar Logoth he freed it, this seed of it, from what
bound it to that place. It will have waxed and waned in him, what
he is in the heart of him fighting what the contagion of Mashadar
sought to make him, but now the battle inside him is almost done,
and he almost defeated. Soon, if it does not kill him first, he
will spread that evil like a plague wherever he goes. Just as one
scratch from that blade is enough to infect and destroy, so, soon,
a few minutes with Mat will be just as deadly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s face had gone white. &ldquo;Can you do anything?&rdquo;
she whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo; Moiraine sighed. &ldquo;For the sake of the
world, I hope I am not too late.&rdquo; Her hand delved into the pouch at
her belt and came out with the silk-shrouded <em>angreal</em> .
&ldquo;Leave me. Stay together, and find somewhere you will not be seen,
but leave me. I will do what I can for him.&rdquo;</p>
