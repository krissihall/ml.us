<h4><em>The Blight</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
wind whipped Lan&rsquo;s cloak, sometimes making him
hard to see even in the sunlight, and Ingtar and the hundred lances
Lord Agelmar had sent to escort them to the Border, in case they
met a Trolloc raid, made a brave display in double column with
their armor and their red pennants and their steel-clad horses led
by Ingtar&rsquo;s Gray Owl banner. They were easily as grand as a hundred
of the Queen&rsquo;s Guards, but it was the towers just in sight ahead of
them that Rand studied. He had had all morning to watch the
Shienaran lances.</p>

<p>Each tower stood tall and solid atop a hill, half a
mile from its neighbor. East and west others rose, and more beyond
those. A broad, walled ramp spiralled around each stone shaft,
winding all the way around by the time it reached the heavy gates
halfway to the crenellated top. A sortie from the garrison would be
protected by the wall until it reached the ground, but enemies
striving to reach the gate would climb under a hail of arrows and
stones and hot oil from the big kettles poised on the outward
flaring ramparts above. A large steel mirror, carefully turned
down, away from the sun now, glittered atop each tower below the
high iron cup where signal fires could be lit when the sun did not
shine. The signal would be flashed, to towers further from the
Border, and by those to still others, and so relayed to the
heartland fortresses, from where the lances would ride to turn back
the raid. Were times normal, they would.</p>

<p>From the two nearest tower tops men watched them
approach. Just a few men on each, peering curiously through the
crenels. In the best of times the towers were only manned enough
for self-defense, depending more on stone walls than strong arms to
survive, but every man who could be spared, and more, was riding to
Tarwin&rsquo;s Gap. The fall of the towers would not matter if the lances
failed to hold the Gap.</p>

<p>Rand shivered as they rode between the towers. It was
almost as if he had ridden through a wall of colder air. This was
the Border. The land beyond looked no different from Shienar, but
out there, somewhere beyond the leafless trees, was the Blight.</p>

<p>Ingtar lifted a steel fist to halt the lances short
of a plain stone post in sight of the towers. A borderpost, marking
the boundary between Shienar and what once was Malkier. &ldquo;Your
pardon, Moiraine Aes Sedai. Pardon, Dai Shan. Pardon, Builder. Lord
Agelmar commanded me to go no further.&rdquo; He sounded unhappy about
it, disgruntled at life in general.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is as we planned, Lord Agelmar and I,&rdquo; Moiraine
said.</p>

<p>Ingtar grunted sourly. &ldquo;Pardon, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; he
apologized, not sounding as if he meant it. &ldquo;To escort you here
means we may not reach the Gap before the fighting is done. I am
robbed of the chance to stand with the rest, and at the same time I
am commanded not to ride one step beyond the borderpost, as if I
had never before been in the Blight. And My Lord Agelmar will not
tell me why.&rdquo; Behind the bars of his face-guard, his eyes turned
the last word into a question to the Aes Sedai. He scorned to look
at Rand and the others; he had learned they would accompany Lan
into the Blight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can have my place,&rdquo; Mat muttered to Rand. Lan
gave them both a sharp look. Mat dropped his eyes, his face turning
red.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Each of us has his part in the Pattern, Ingtar,&rdquo;
Moiraine said firmly. &ldquo;From here we must thread ours alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ingtar&rsquo;s bow was stiffer than his armor made it. &ldquo;As
you wish it, Aes Sedai. I must leave you, now, and ride hard in
order to reach Tarwin&rsquo;s Gap. At least I will be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>allowed</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to face Trollocs there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you truly that eager?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked. &ldquo;To fight
Trollocs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ingtar gave her a puzzled look, then glanced at Lan
as if the Warder might explain. &ldquo;That is what I do, Lady,&rdquo; he said
slowly. &ldquo;That is why I am.&rdquo; He raised a gauntleted hand to Lan,
open palm toward the warder. &ldquo;<em>Suravye ninto manshima taishite,
Dai Shan</em>. Peace favor your sword.&rdquo; Pulling his horse around,
Ingtar rode east with his bannerman and his hundred lances. They
went at a walk, but a steady pace, as fast as armored horses could
manage with a far distance yet to go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a strange thing to say,&rdquo; Egwene said. &ldquo;Why do
they use it like that? Peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you have never known a thing except to dream,&rdquo;
Lan replied, heeling Mandarb forward, &ldquo;it becomes more than a
talisman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Rand followed the Warder past the stone
borderpost, he turned in his saddle to look back, watching Ingtar
and the lances disappear behind barren trees, and the borderpost
vanish, and last of all the towers on their hilltops, looking over
the trees. All too soon they were alone, riding north under the
leafless canopy of the forest. Rand sank into watchful silence, and
for once even Mat had nothing to say.</p>

<p>That morning the gates of Fal Dara had opened with
the dawn. Lord Agelmar, armored and helmeted now like his soldiers,
rode with the Black Hawk banner and the Three Foxes from the East
Gate toward the sun, still only a red sliver above the trees. Like
a steel snake undulating to mounted kettle-drums, the column wound
its way out of the town four abreast, Agelmar at its head hidden in
the forest before its tail left Fal Dara keep. There were no cheers
in the streets to speed them on their way, only their own drums and
their pennants&rsquo; cracking in the wind, but their eyes looked toward
the rising sun with purpose. Eastward they would join other steel
serpents, from Fal Moran, behind King Easar himself with his sons
at his side, and from Ankor Dail, that held the Eastern Marches and
guarded the Spine of the World; from Mos Shirare and Fal Sion and
Camron Caan, and all the other fortresses in Shienar, great and
small. Joined into a greater serpent, they would turn north to
Tarwin&rsquo;s Gap.</p>

<p>Another exodus had begun at the same time, using the
King&rsquo;s Gate that led out on the way to Fal Moran. Carts and wagons,
people mounted and people afoot, driving their livestock, carrying
children on their backs, faces as long as the morning shadows.
Reluctance to leave their homes, perhaps forever, slowed their
feet, yet fear of what was coming spurred them, so that they went
in bursts, feet dragging, then breaking into a run for a dozen
paces only to fall back, once more, to shuffling through the dust.
A few paused outside the town to watch the soldiers&rsquo; armored line
winding into the forest. Hope blossomed in some eyes, and prayers
were muttered, prayers for the soldiers, prayers for themselves,
before they turned south again, trudging.</p>

<p>The smallest column went out of the Malkier Gate.
Left behind were a few who would remain, soldiers and a sprinkling
of older men, their wives dead and their grown children making the
slow way south. A last handful so that whatever happened in
Tarwin&rsquo;s Gap, Fal Dara would not fall undefended. Ingtar&rsquo;s Gray Owl
led the way, but it was Moiraine who took them north. The most
important column of all, and the most desperate.</p>

<p>For at least an hour after they passed the borderpost
there was no change in land or forest. The Warder kept them at a
hard pace, as fast a walk as the horses could maintain, but Rand
kept wondering when they would reach the Blight. The hills became a
little higher, but the trees, and the creepers, and the underbrush
were no different than what he had seen in Shienar, gray and all
but leafless. He began to feel warmer, warm enough to sling his
cloak across the pommel of his saddle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the best weather we&rsquo;ve seen all year,&rdquo;
Egwene said, shrugging out of her own cloak.</p>

<p>Nynaeve shook her head, frowning as if listening to
the wind. &ldquo;It feels wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand nodded. He could feel it, too, though he could
not say what it was exactly he was feeling. The wrongness went
beyond the first warmth he could remember out of doors this year;
it was more than the simple fact that it should not be so warm this
far north. It must be the Blight, but the land was the same.</p>

<p>The sun climbed high, a red ball that could not give
so much warmth despite the cloudless sky. A little while later he
unbuttoned his coat. Sweat trickled down his face.</p>

<p>He was not the only one. Mat took his coat off,
openly displaying the gold-and-ruby dagger, and wiped his face with
the end of his scarf. Blinking, he rewound the scarf into a narrow
band low over his eyes. Nynaeve and Egwene fanned themselves; they
rode slumped as if they were wilting. Loial undid his high-collared
tunic all the way down, and his shirt as well; the Ogier had a
narrow strip of hair up the middle of his chest, as thick as fur.
He muttered apologies all around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must forgive me. Stedding Shangtai is in the
mountains, and cool.&rdquo; His broad nostrils flared, drawing in air
that was becoming warmer by the minute. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this heat,
and damp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It <em>was</em> damp, Rand realized. It felt like the
Mire in the depths of summer, back in the Two Rivers. In that boggy
swamp every breath came as if through a wool blanket soaked in hot
water. There was no soggy ground here&mdash;only a few ponds and streams,
trickles to someone used to the Waterwood&mdash;but the air was
like that in the Mire. Only Perrin, still in his coat, was
breathing easily. Perrin and the Warder.</p>

<p>There were a few leaves now, on trees that were not
evergreen. Rand reached out to touch a branch, and stopped with his
hand short of the leaves. Sickly yellow mottled the red of the new
growth, and black flecks like disease.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you not to touch anything.&rdquo; The Warder&rsquo;s
voice was flat. He still wore his shifting cloak, as if heat made
no more impression on him than cold; it almost made his angular
face seem to float unsupported above Mandarb&rsquo;s back. &ldquo;Flowers can
kill in the Blight, and leaves maim. There&rsquo;s a little thing called
a Stick that likes to hide where the leaves are thickest, looking
like its name, waiting for something to touch it. When something
does, it bites. Not poison. The juice begins to digest the Stick&rsquo;s
prey for it. The only thing that can save you is to cut off the arm
or leg that was bitten. But a Stick won&rsquo;t bite unless you touch it.
Other things in the Blight will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand jerked his hand back, leaves untouched, and
wiped it on his pants leg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;re in the Blight?&rdquo; Perrin said. Strangely,
he did not sound frightened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just the fringe,&rdquo; Lan said grimly. His stallion kept
moving forward, and he spoke over his shoulder. &ldquo;The real Blight
still lies ahead. There are things in the Blight that hunt by
sound, and some may have wandered this far south. Sometimes they
cross the Mountains of Dhoom. Much worse than Sticks. Keep quiet
and keep up, if you want to stay alive.&rdquo; He continued to set a hard
pace, not waiting for an answer.</p>

<p>Mile by mile the corruption of the Blight became more
apparent. Leaves covered the trees in ever greater profusion, but
stained and spotted with yellow and black, with livid red streaks
like blood poisoning. Every leaf and creeper seemed bloated, ready
to burst at a touch. Flowers hung on trees and weeds in a parody of
spring, sickly pale and pulpy, waxen things that appeared to be
rotting while Rand watched. When he breathed through his nose, the
sweet stench of decay, heavy and thick, sickened him; when he tried
breathing through his mouth, he almost gagged. The air tasted like
a mouthful of spoiled meat. The horses&rsquo; hooves made a soft
squishing as rotten-ripe things broke open under them.</p>

<p>Mat leaned out of his saddle and spewed until his
stomach was empty. Rand sought the void, but calmness was little
help against the burning bile that kept creeping up his throat.
Empty or not, Mat heaved again a mile later, bringing up nothing,
and yet again after that. Egwene looked as if she wanted to be
sick, too, swallowing constantly, and Nynaeve&rsquo;s face was a white
mask of determination, her jaw set and her eyes fixed on Moiraine&rsquo;s
back. The Wisdom would not admit to feeling ill unless the Aes
Sedai did, first, but Rand did not think she would have to wait
long. Moiraine&rsquo;s eyes were tight, and her lips pale.</p>

<p>Despite the heat and damp, Loial wrapped a scarf
around his nose and mouth. When he met Rand&rsquo;s gaze, the Ogier&rsquo;s
outrage and disgust were plain in his eyes. &ldquo;I had heard&mdash;&rdquo;
he began, his voice muffled by the wool, then stopped to clear his
throat with a grimace. &ldquo;Faugh! It tastes like&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Faugh! I had
heard and read about the Blight, but nothing could describe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;
His gesture somehow took in the smell as well as the eye-sickening
growth. &ldquo;That even the Dark One should do this to trees!
Faugh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Warder was not affected, of course, at least not
that Rand could see, but to his surprise neither was Perrin. Or
rather, not in the way the rest of them were. The big youth glared
at the obscene forest through which they rode as he might have at
an enemy, or the banner of an enemy. He caressed the axe at his
belt as if unaware of what he was doing, and muttered to himself,
half growling in a way that made the hair on Rand&rsquo;s neck stir. Even
in full sunlight his eyes glowed, golden and fierce.</p>

<p>The heat did not abate as the bloody sun fell toward
the horizon. In the distance to the north, mountains rose, higher
than the Mountains of Mist, black against the sky. Sometimes an icy
wind from the sharp peaks gusted far enough to reach them. The
torrid humidity leached away most of the mountain chill, but what
remained was winter-cold compared to the swelter it replaced, if
just for a moment. The sweat on Rand&rsquo;s face seemed to flash into
beads of ice; as the wind died, the beads melted again, running
angry lines down his cheeks, and the thick heat returned harder
than before by comparison. For the instant the wind surrounded
them, it swept away the fetor, yet he would have done without that,
too, if he could have. The cold was the chill of the grave, and it
carried the dusty must of an old tomb newly opened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We cannot reach the mountains by nightfall,&rdquo; Lan
said, &ldquo;and it is dangerous to move at night, even for a Warder
alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a place not far off,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;It
will be a good omen for us to camp there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Warder gave her a flat look, then nodded
reluctantly. &ldquo;Yes. We must camp somewhere. It might as well be
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Eye of the World was beyond the high passes when
I found it,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;Better to cross the Mountains of Dhoom
in full daylight, at noon, when the Dark One&rsquo;s powers in this world
are weakest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You talk as if the Eye isn&rsquo;t always in the same
place.&rdquo; Egwene spoke to the Aes Sedai, but it was Loial who
answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No two among the Ogier have found it in exactly the
same place. The Green Man seems to be found where he is needed. But
it has always been beyond the high passes. They are treacherous,
the high passes, and haunted by creatures of the Dark One.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must reach the passes before we need worry about
them,&rdquo; Lan said. &ldquo;Tomorrow we will be truly into the Blight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand looked at the forest around him, every leaf and
flower diseased, every creeper decaying as it grew, and he could
not repress a shudder. <em>If this isn&rsquo;t truly the Blight, what
is?</em></p>

<p>Lan turned them westward, at an angle to the sinking
sun. The Warder maintained the pace he had set before, but there
was reluctance in the set of his shoulders.</p>

<p>The sun was a sullen red ball just touching the
treetops when they crested a hill and the Warder drew rein. Beyond
them to the west lay a network of lakes, the waters glittering
darkly in the slanting sunlight, like beads of random size on a
necklace of many strings. In the distance, circled by the lakes,
stood jagged-topped hills, thick in the creeping shadows of
evening. For one brief instant the sun&rsquo;s rays caught the shattered
tops, and Rand&rsquo;s breath stilled. Not hills. The broken remnants of
seven towers. He was not sure if anyone else had seen it; the sight
was gone as quickly as it came. The Warder was dismounting, his
face as lacking in emotion as a stone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we camp down by the lakes?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked,
patting her face with her kerchief. &ldquo;It must be cooler down by the
water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light,&rdquo; Mat said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d just like to stick my head in
one of them. I might never take it out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then something roiled the waters of the nearest
lake, the dark water phosphorescing as a huge body rolled beneath
the surface. Length on man-thick length sent ripples spreading,
rolling on and on until at last a tail rose, waving a point like a
wasp&rsquo;s stinger for an instant in the twilight, at least five spans
into the air. All along that length fat tentacles writhed like
monstrous worms, as many as a centipede&rsquo;s legs. It slid slowly
beneath the surface and was gone, only the fading ripples to say it
had ever been.</p>

<p>Rand closed his mouth and exchanged a look with
Perrin. Perrin&rsquo;s yellow eyes were as disbelieving as he knew his
own must be. Nothing that big could live in a lake that size.
<em>Those couldn&rsquo;t have been hands on those tentacles. They
couldn&rsquo;t have been</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On second thought,&rdquo; Mat said faintly, &ldquo;I like it
right here just fine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will set guarding wards around this hill,&rdquo;
Moiraine said. She had already dismounted from Aldieb. &ldquo;A true
barrier would draw the attention we do not want like flies to
honey, but if any creation of the Dark One or anything that serves
the Shadow comes within a mile of us, I will know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be happier with the barrier,&rdquo; Mat said as his
boots touched the ground, &ldquo;just as long as it kept that, that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;thing on the other side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, do be quiet, Mat,&rdquo; Egwene said curtly, at the
same time as Nynaeve spoke. &ldquo;And have them waiting for us when we
leave in the morning? You are a fool, Matrim Cauthon.&rdquo; Mat glowered
at the two women as they climbed down, but he kept his mouth
shut.</p>

<p>As he took Bela&rsquo;s reins, Rand shared a grin with
Perrin. For a moment it was almost like being home, having Mat
saying what he should not at the worst possible time. Then the
smile faded from Perrin&rsquo;s face; in the twilight his eyes
<em>did</em> glow, as if they had a yellow light behind them.
Rand&rsquo;s grin slipped away, too. <em>It isn&rsquo;t like home at
all</em>.</p>

<p>Rand and Mat and Perrin helped Lan unsaddle and
hobble the horses while the others began setting up the camp. Loial
muttered to himself as he set up the Warder&rsquo;s tiny stove, but his
thick fingers moved deftly. Egwene was humming as she filled the
tea kettle from a bulging waterbag. Rand no longer wondered why the
Warder had insisted on bringing so many full waterskins.</p>

<p>Setting the bay&rsquo;s saddle in line with the others, he
unfastened his saddlebags and blanketroll from the cantle, turned,
and stopped with a tingle of fear. The Ogier and the women were
gone. So was the stove and all the wicker panniers from the
packhorse. The hilltop was empty except for evening shadows.</p>

<p>With a numb hand he fumbled for his sword, dimly
hearing Mat curse. Perrin had his axe out, his shaggy head
swiveling to find the danger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sheepherders,&rdquo; Lan muttered. Unconcernedly the
Warder strode across the hilltop, and at his third step, he
vanished.</p>

<p>Rand exchanged wide-eyed looks with Mat and Perrin,
and then they were all darting for where the Warder had
disappeared. Abruptly Rand skidded to a halt, taking another step
when Mat ran into his back. Egwene looked up from setting the
kettle atop the tiny stove. Nynaeve was closing the mantle on a
second lit lantern. They were all there, Moiraine sitting
cross-legged, Lan lounging on an elbow, Loial taking a book out of
his pack.</p>

<p>Cautiously Rand looked behind him. The hillside was
there as it had been, the shadowed trees, the lakes beyond sinking
into darkness. He was afraid to step back, afraid they would all
disappear again and perhaps this time he would not be able to find
them. Edging carefully around him, Perrin let out a long
breath.</p>

<p>Moiraine noticed the three of them standing there,
gaping. Perrin looked abashed, and slipped his axe back into the
heavy belt loop as if he thought no one might notice. A smile
touched her lips. &ldquo;It is a simple thing,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;a bending, so
any eye looking at us sees around us, instead. We cannot have the
eyes that will be out there seeing our lights tonight, and the
Blight is no place to be in the dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moiraine Sedai says I might be able to do it.&rdquo;
Egwene&rsquo;s eyes were bright. &ldquo;She says I can handle enough of the One
Power right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not without training, child,&rdquo; Moiraine cautioned.
&ldquo;The simplest matter concerning the One Power can be dangerous to
the untrained, and to those around them.&rdquo; Perrin snorted, and
Egwene looked so uncomfortable that Rand wondered if she had
already been trying her abilities.</p>

<p>Nynaeve set down the lantern. Together with the tiny
flame of the stove, the pair of lanterns gave a generous light.
&ldquo;When you go to Tar Valon, Egwene,&rdquo; she said carefully, &ldquo;perhaps
I&rsquo;ll go with you.&rdquo; The look she gave Moiraine was strangely
defensive. &ldquo;It will do her good to see a familiar face among
strangers. She&rsquo;ll need someone to advise her besides Aes
Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps that would be for the best, Wisdom,&rdquo;
Moiraine said simply.</p>

<p>Egwene laughed and clapped her hands. &ldquo;Oh, that
<em>will</em> be wonderful. And you, Rand. You&rsquo;ll come, too, won&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; He paused in the act of sitting across the stove from her,
then slowly lowered himself. He thought her eyes had never been
bigger, or brighter, or more like pools that he could lose himself
in. Spots of color appeared in her cheeks, and she gave a smaller
laugh. &ldquo;Perrin, Mat, you two will come, won&rsquo;t you? We&rsquo;ll all be
together.&rdquo; Mat gave a grunt that could have signified anything, and
Perrin only shrugged, but she took it for assent. &ldquo;You see, Rand.
We&rsquo;ll all be together.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Light, but a man could drown in those eyes and be
happy doing it</em>. Embarrassed, he cleared his throat. &ldquo;Do they
have sheep in Tar Valon? That&rsquo;s all I know, herding sheep and
growing tabac.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; Moiraine said, &ldquo;that I can find
something for you to do in Tar Valon. For all of you. Not herding
sheep, perhaps, but something you will find interesting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; Egwene said as if it were settled. &ldquo;I know.
I will make you my Warder, when I&rsquo;m an Aes Sedai. You would like
being a Warder, wouldn&rsquo;t you? My Warder?&rdquo; She sounded sure, but he
saw the question in her eyes. She wanted an answer, needed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like being your Warder,&rdquo; he said. <em>She&rsquo;s not
for you, nor you for her. Why did Min have to tell me
that?</em></p>

<p>Darkness came down heavily, and everyone was tired.
Loial was the first to roll over and ready himself for sleep, but
others followed soon after. No one used their blankets, except for
a pillow. Moiraine had put something in the oil of the lamps that
dispelled the stench of the Blight from the hilltop, but nothing
diminished the heat. The moon gave a wavering, watery light, but
the sun might have been at its zenith for all the cool the night
had.</p>

<p>Rand found sleep impossible, even with the Aes Sedai
stretched out not a span away to shield his dreams. It was the
thick air that kept him awake. Loial&rsquo;s soft snores were a rumble
that made Perrin&rsquo;s seem nonexistent, but they did not stop
weariness from claiming the others. The Warder was still awake,
seated not far from him with his sword across his knees, watching
the night. To Rand&rsquo;s surprise, so was Nynaeve.</p>

<p>The Wisdom looked at Lan silently for a long time,
then poured a cup of tea and brought it to him. When he reached out
with a murmur of thanks, she did not let go right away. &ldquo;I should
have known you would be a king,&rdquo; she said quietly. Her eyes were
steady on the Warder&rsquo;s face, but her voice trembled slightly.</p>

<p>Lan looked back at her just as intently. It seemed to
Rand that the Warder&rsquo;s face actually softened. &ldquo;I am not a king,
Nynaeve. Just a man. A man without as much to his name as even the
meanest farmer&rsquo;s croft.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s voice steadied. &ldquo;Some women don&rsquo;t ask for
land, or gold. Just the man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the man who would ask her to accept so little
would not be worthy of her. You are a remarkable woman, as
beautiful as the sunrise, as fierce as a warrior. You are a
lioness, Wisdom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Wisdom seldom weds.&rdquo; She paused to take a deep
breath, as if steeling herself. &ldquo;But if I go to Tar Valon, it may
be that I will be something other than a Wisdom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aes Sedai marry as seldom as Wisdoms. Few men can
live with so much power in a wife, dimming them by her radiance
whether she wishes to or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some men are strong enough. I know one such.&rdquo; If
there could have been any doubt, her look left none as to whom she
meant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All I have is a sword, and a war I cannot win, but
can never stop fighting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you I care nothing for that. Light, you&rsquo;ve
made me say more than is proper already. Will you shame me to the
point of asking you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will never shame you.&rdquo; The gentle tone, like a
caress, sounded odd to Rand&rsquo;s ears in the Warder&rsquo;s voice, but it
made Nynaeve&rsquo;s eyes brighten. &ldquo;I will hate the man you choose
because he is not me, and love him if he makes you smile. No woman
deserves the sure knowledge of widow&rsquo;s black as her brideprice, you
least of all.&rdquo; He set the untouched cup on the ground and rose. &ldquo;I
must check the horses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve remained there, kneeling, after he had
gone.</p>

<p>Sleep or no, Rand closed his eyes. He did not think
the Wisdom would like it if he watched her cry.</p>
