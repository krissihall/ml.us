<h4><em>The Dark Along the Ways</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n
the darkness just before dawn Rand followed
Moiraine down to the back hall, where Master Gill and the others
were waiting, Nynaeve and Egwene as anxiously as Loial, Perrin
almost as calm as the Warder. Mat stayed on Rand&rsquo;s heels as if he
were afraid to be even a little alone now, even as much as a few
feet away. The cook and her helpers straightened, staring as the
party passed silently into the kitchen, already brightly lit and
hot with preparations for breakfast. It was not usual for patrons
of the inn to be up and out at that hour. At Master Gill&rsquo;s soothing
words, the cook gave a loud sniff and slapped her dough down hard.
They were all back to tending griddles and kneading dough before
Rand reached the stableyard door.</p>

<p>Outside, the night was still pitch-black. To Rand,
everyone else was only a darker shadow at best. He followed the
innkeeper and Lan blindly, blind in truth, hoping Master Gill&rsquo;s
knowledge of his own stableyard and the Warder&rsquo;s instincts would
get them across it without someone breaking a leg. Loial stumbled
more than once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why we can&rsquo;t have just one light,&rdquo; the
Ogier grumbled. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t go running about in the dark in the
<em>stedding</em>. I&rsquo;m an Ogier, not a cat.&rdquo; Rand had a sudden
image of Loial&rsquo;s tufted ears twitching irritably.</p>

<p>The stable loomed up suddenly out of the night, a
threatening mass until the stable door creaked open, spilling a
narrow stream of light into the yard. The innkeeper only opened it
wide enough for them to go in one at a time, and hastily pulled it
to behind Perrin, almost clipping his heels. Rand blinked in the
sudden light inside.</p>

<p>The stablemen were not surprised by their appearance,
as the cook had been. Their horses were saddled and waiting.
Mandarb stood arrogantly, ignoring everyone but Lan, but Aldieb
stretched her nose out to nuzzle Moiraine&rsquo;s hand. There was a
packhorse, bulky with wicker panniers, and a huge animal with hairy
fetlocks, taller even than the Warder&rsquo;s stallion, for Loial. It
looked big enough to pull a loaded haywain by itself, but compared
with the Ogier it seemed a pony.</p>

<p>Loial eyed the big horse and muttered doubtfully, &ldquo;My
own feet have always been good enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master Gill motioned to Rand. The innkeeper was
lending him a bay almost the color of his own hair, tall and deep
of chest, but with none of the fire in his step that Cloud had had,
Rand was glad to see. Master Gill said his name was Red.</p>

<p>Egwene went straight to Bela, and Nynaeve to her
long-legged mare.</p>

<p>Mat brought his dun-colored horse over by Rand.
&ldquo;Perrin&rsquo;s making me nervous,&rdquo; he muttered. Rand looked at him
sharply. &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s acting strange. Don&rsquo;t you see it, too? I swear
it&rsquo;s not my imagination, or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand nodded. <em>Not the dagger taking hold of him
again, thank the Light</em>. &ldquo;He is, Mat, but just be easy.
Moiraine knows about&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;whatever it is. Perrin&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; He
wished he could believe it, but it seemed to satisfy Mat, a little
at least.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Mat said hastily, still watching Perrin
out of the corner of his eye. &ldquo;I never said he wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master Gill conferred with the head groom. That
leathery-skinned man, with a face like one of the horses, knuckled
his forehead and hurried to the back of the stable. The innkeeper
turned to Moiraine with a satisfied smile on his round face. &ldquo;Ramey
says the way is clear, Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rear wall of the stable appeared solid and stout,
lined with heavy racks of tools. Ramey and another stableman
cleared away the hayforks, rakes, and shovels, then reached behind
the racks to manipulate hidden latches. Abruptly a section of the
wall swung inward on hinges so well concealed that Rand was not
sure he could find them even with the disguised door standing open.
Light from the stable illuminated a brick wall only a few feet
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a narrow run between buildings,&rdquo; the
innkeeper said, &ldquo;but nobody outside this stable knows there&rsquo;s a way
into it from here. Whitecloaks or white cockades, there&rsquo;ll not be
any watchers to see where you come out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai nodded. &ldquo;Remember, good innkeeper, if
you fear any trouble from this, write to Sheriam Sedai, of the Blue
Ajah, in Tar Valon, and she will help. I fear my sisters and I have
a good deal to put right already for those who have helped me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master Gill laughed; not the laugh of a worried man.
&ldquo;Why, Aes Sedai, you&rsquo;ve already given me the only inn in all of
Caemlyn without any rats. What more could I ask for? I can double
my custom on that alone.&rdquo; His grin faded into seriousness.
&ldquo;Whatever you&rsquo;re up to, the Queen holds with Tar Valon, and I hold
with the Queen, so I wish you well. The Light illumine you, Aes
Sedai. The Light illumine you all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light illumine you, also, Master Gill,&rdquo; Moiraine
replied with a bow of her head. &ldquo;But if the Light is to shine on
any of us, we must be quick.&rdquo; Briskly she turned to Loial. &ldquo;Are you
ready?&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a wary look at its teeth, the Ogier took the
reins of the big horse. Trying to keep that mouth the length of the
reins from his hand, he led the animal to the opening at the back
of the stable. Ramey hopped from one foot to the other, impatient
to close it again. For a moment Loial paused with his head cocked
as if feeling a breeze on his cheek. &ldquo;This way,&rdquo; he said, and
turned down the narrow alley.</p>

<p>Moiraine followed right behind Loial&rsquo;s horse, then
Rand, and Mat. Rand had the first turn leading the packhorse.
Nynaeve and Egwene made the middle of the column, with Perrin
behind them, and Lan bringing up the rear. The hidden door swung
hastily shut as soon as Mandarb stepped into the dirt alleyway. The
<em>snick-snick</em> of latches locking, shutting them off, sounded
unnaturally loud to Rand.</p>

<p>The run, as Master Gill had called it, was very
narrow indeed, and even darker than the stableyard, if that was
possible. Tall, blank walls of brick or wood lined both sides, with
only a narrow strip of black sky overhead. The big, woven baskets
slung on the packhorse scraped the buildings on both sides. The
panniers bulged with supplies for the journey, most of it clay jars
filled with oil. A bundle of poles was lashed lengthwise down the
horse&rsquo;s back, and each had a lantern swinging at the end of it. In
the Ways, Loial said, it was darker than the darkest night.</p>

<p>The partially filled lanterns sloshed with the motion
of the horse, and clinked against each other with a tinny sound. It
was not a very loud noise, but in the hour before dawn Caemlyn was
quiet. Silent. The dull metallic clinks sounded as if they could be
heard a mile away.</p>

<p>When the run let out into a street, Loial chose his
direction without a pause. He seemed to know exactly where he was
going, now, as if the route he needed to follow was becoming
clearer. Rand did not understand how the Ogier could find the
Waygate, and Loial had not been able to explain very well. He just
knew, he said; he could feel it. Loial claimed it was like trying
to explain how to breathe.</p>

<p>As they hurried up the street Rand looked back toward
the corner where The Queen&rsquo;s Blessing lay. According to Lamgwin,
there were still half a dozen Whitecloaks not far down from that
corner. Their interest was all on the inn, but a noise would surely
bring them. No one was out at this hour for a reputable reason. The
horseshoes seemed to ring on the paving stones like bells; the
lanterns clattered as if the packhorse were shaking them
deliberately. Not until they had rounded another corner did he stop
looking over his shoulder. He heard relieved sighs from the other
Emond&rsquo;s Fielders as they came round it, too.</p>

<p>Loial appeared to be following the most direct path
to the Waygate, wherever it took them. Sometimes they trotted down
broad avenues, empty save for an occasional dog skulking in the
dark. Sometimes they hurried along alleys as narrow as the stable
run, where things squished under an unwary step. Nynaeve complained
softly about the resulting smells, but no one slowed down.</p>

<p>The darkness began to lessen, fading toward a dark
gray. Faint glimmers of dawn pearled the sky above the eastern
rooftops. A few people appeared on the streets, bundled up against
the early cold, heads down while they yet dreamed of their beds.
Most paid no mind to anyone else. Only a handful even glanced at
the line of people and horses with Loial at its head, and only one
of those truly saw them.</p>

<p>That one man flicked his eyes at them, just like the
others, already sinking back into his own thoughts when suddenly he
stumbled and almost fell, turning himself back around to stare.
There was only light enough to see shapes, but that was too much.
Seen at a distance by himself, the Ogier could have passed for a
tall man leading an ordinary horse, or for an ordinary man leading
an under-sized horse. With the others in a line behind him to give
perspective, Loial looked exactly as big as he was, half again as
tall as any man should be. The man took one look and, with a
strangled cry, set off running, his cloak flapping behind him.</p>

<p>There would be more people in the streets soon&mdash;very soon. Rand eyed a woman hurrying past on the other side of the
street, seeing nothing but the pavement in front of her feet. More
people to notice soon. The eastern sky grew lighter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; Loial announced at last. &ldquo;It is under
there.&rdquo; It was a shop he pointed to, still closed for the night.
The tables out front were bare, the awnings over them rolled up
tight, the door stoutly shuttered. The windows above, where the
shopkeeper lived, were still dark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Under?&rdquo; Mat exclaimed incredulously. &ldquo;How in the
Light can we&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine raised a hand that cut him off, and motioned
for them to follow her into the alley beside the shop. Horses and
people together, they crowded the opening between the two
buildings. Shaded by the walls, it was darker there than on the
street, near to full night again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There must be a cellar door,&rdquo; Moiraine muttered.
&ldquo;Ah, yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly light blossomed. A coolly glowing ball the
size of a man&rsquo;s fist hung suspended over the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s palm,
moving as she moved her hand. Rand thought that it was a measure of
what they had been through that everyone seemed to take it as a
matter of course. She put it close to the doors she had found,
slanted almost flat to the ground, with a hasp held by thick bolts
and an iron lock bigger than Rand&rsquo;s hand and thick with old
rust.</p>

<p>Loial gave the lock a tug. &ldquo;I can pull it off, hasp
and all, but it will make enough noise to wake the whole
neighborhood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us not damage the goodman&rsquo;s property if we can
avoid it.&rdquo; Moiraine studied the lock intently for a moment.
Suddenly she gave the rusty iron a tap with her staff, and the lock
fell open neatly.</p>

<p>Hastily Loial undid the lock and swung the doors up,
propping them back. Moiraine went down the ramp thus revealed,
lighting her way with the glowing ball. Aldieb stepped delicately
behind her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light the lanterns and come down,&rdquo; she called
softly. &ldquo;There is plenty of room. Hurry. It will be light out
soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand hurriedly untied the poled lanterns off the
packhorse, but even before the first was lit he realized he could
see Mat&rsquo;s features. People would be filling the streets in minutes,
and the shopkeeper would be coming down to open up for business,
all wondering why the alleyway was crammed full of horses. Mat
muttered something nervously about taking horses indoors, but Rand
was glad to lead his down the ramp. Mat followed, grumbling but no
less quickly.</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s lantern swung on the end of its pole, bumping
the ceiling if he was not careful, and neither Red nor the
packhorse liked the ramp. Then he was down and getting out of Mat&rsquo;s
way. Moiraine let her floating light die, but as the rest joined
them, the added lanterns lit the open space.</p>

<p>The cellar was as long and as wide as the building
above, much of the space taken up by brick columns, flaring up from
narrow bases to five times as big at the ceiling. The place seemed
made up from a series of arches. There was plenty of room, but Rand
still felt crowded. Loial&rsquo;s head brushed the ceiling. As the rusted
lock had foretold, the cellar had not been used in a long time. The
floor was bare except for a few broken barrels filled with odds and
ends, and a thick layer of dust. Motes, stirred up by so many feet,
sparkled in the lantern light.</p>

<p>Lan was last in, and as soon as he had Mandarb down
the ramp he climbed back to pull the doors shut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blood and ashes,&rdquo; Mat growled, &ldquo;why would they build
one of these gates in a place like this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not always like this,&rdquo; Loial said. His
rumbling voice echoed in the cavernous space. &ldquo;Not always. No!&rdquo; The
Ogier was angry, Rand realized with a shock. &ldquo;Once trees stood
here. Every kind of tree that would grow in this place, every kind
of tree that Ogier could coax to grow here. The Great Trees, a
hundred spans high. Shade of branch, and cool breezes to catch the
smell of leaf and flower and hold the memory of the peace of the
<em>stedding</em>. All that, murdered for this!&rdquo; His fist thumped a
column.</p>

<p>The column seemed to shake under that blow. Rand was
certain he heard bricks crack. Waterfalls of dry mortar slid down
the column.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is already woven cannot be undone,&rdquo; Moiraine
said gently. &ldquo;It will not make the trees grow again for you to
bring the building down on our heads.&rdquo; Loial&rsquo;s drooping eyebrows
made him look more abashed than a human face could have managed.
&ldquo;With your help, Loial, perhaps we can keep the groves that still
stand from falling under the Shadow. You have brought us to what we
seek.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she moved to one of the walls, Rand realized that
that wall was different from the others. They were ordinary brick;
this was intricately worked stone, fanciful swirls of leaves and
vines, pale even under its coat of dust. The brick and mortar were
old, but something about the stone said it had stood there long,
long before the brick was fired. Later builders, themselves
centuries gone, had incorporated what already stood, and still
later men had made it part of a cellar.</p>

<p>One part of the carved stone wall, right in the
center, was more elaborate than the rest. As well done as the rest
was, it appeared a crude copy in comparison. Worked in hard stone,
those leaves seemed soft, caught in one frozen moment as a gentle
summer breeze stirred them. For all of that, they had the feel of
age, as much greater than the rest of the stone as the rest was
older than the brick. That old and more. Loial looked at them as if
he would rather be anywhere else but there, even out in the streets
with another mob.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Avendesora</em>,&rdquo; Moiraine murmured, resting
her hand on a trefoil leaf in the stonework. Rand scanned the
carving; that was the only leaf of its kind he could find. &ldquo;The
leaf of the Tree of Life is the key,&rdquo; the Aes Sedai said, and the
leaf came away in her hand.</p>

<p>Rand blinked; from behind him he heard gasps. That
leaf had seemed no less a part of the wall than any other. Just as
simply, the Aes Sedai set it against the pattern a handspan lower.
The three-pointed leaf fit there as if the space had been intended
for it, and once more it was a part of the whole. As soon as it was
in place the entire nature of the central stonework changed.</p>

<p>He was sure now that he could see the leaves ruffled
by some unfelt breeze; he almost thought they were verdant under
the dust, a tapestry of thick spring greenery there in the
lantern-lit cellar. Almost imperceptibly at first, a split opened
up in the middle of the ancient carving, widening as the two halves
slowly swung into the cellar until they stood straight out. The
backs of the gates were worked as the fronts, the same profusion of
vines and leaves, almost alive. Behind, where should have been dirt
or the cellar of the next building, a dull, reflective shimmering
faintly caught their images.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard,&rdquo; Loial said, half mourning, half
fearful, &ldquo;that once the Waygates shone like mirrors. Once, who
entered the Ways walked through the sun and the sky. Once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have no time for waiting,&rdquo; Moiraine said.</p>

<p>Lan went past her, leading Mandarb, poled lantern in
hand. His shadowy reflection approached him, leading a shadowy
horse. Man and reflection seemed to step into each other at the
shimmering surface, and both were gone. For a moment the black
stallion balked, an apparently continuous rein connecting him to
the dim shape of his own image. The rein tightened, and the
warhorse, too, vanished.</p>

<p>For a minute everyone in the cellar stood staring at
the Waygate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry,&rdquo; Moiraine urged. &ldquo;I must be the last through.
We cannot leave this open for anyone to find by chance. Hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a heavy sigh Loial strode into the shimmer.
Tossing its head, his big horse tried to hold back from the surface
and was hauled through. They were gone as completely as the Warder
and Mandarb.</p>

<p>Hesitantly, Rand poked his lantern at the Waygate.
The lantern sank into its reflection, the two merging until both
were gone. He made himself keep on walking forward, watching the
pole disappear into itself inch by inch, and then he was stepping
into himself, entering the gate. His mouth fell open. Something icy
slid along his skin, as if he were passing through a wall of cold
water. Time stretched out; the cold enveloped one hair at a time,
shivered over his clothes thread by thread.</p>

<p>Abruptly the chill burst like a bubble, and he paused
to catch his breath. He was inside the Ways. Just ahead Lan and
Loial waited patiently by their horses. All around them was
blackness that seemed to stretch on forever. Their lanterns made a
small pool of light around them, too small, as if something pressed
back the light, or ate it.</p>

<p>Of a sudden anxious, he jerked at his reins. Red and
the packhorse came leaping through, nearly knocking him down.
Stumbling, he caught himself and hurried to the Warder and the
Ogier, pulling the nervous horses behind him. The animals whickered
softly. Even Mandarb appeared to take some comfort from the
presence of other horses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go easy when you pass through a Waygate, Rand,&rdquo;
Loial cautioned. &ldquo;Things are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;different inside the Ways than
out. Look.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked back the way the Ogier pointed, thinking to
see the same dull shimmer. Instead he could see into the cellar, as
if through a large piece of smoked glass set in the blackness.
Disturbingly the darkness around the window into the cellar gave a
sense of depth, as though the opening stood alone with nothing
around or behind it but the dark. He said as much with a shaky
laugh, but Loial took him seriously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could walk all the way around it, and you would
not see a thing from the other side. I would not advise it, though.
The books aren&rsquo;t very clear about what lies behind the Waygates. I
think you could become lost there, and never find your way
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shook his head and tried to concentrate on the
Waygate itself rather than what lay behind it, but that was just as
disturbing in its own fashion. If there had been anything to look
at in the darkness besides the Waygate, he would have looked at it.
In the cellar, through the smoky dimness, Moiraine and the others
were plain enough, but they moved as if in a dream. Every blink of
an eye seemed a deliberate, exaggerated gesture. Mat was making his
way to the Waygate as though walking through clear jelly, his legs
seeming to swim forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Wheel turns faster in the Ways,&rdquo; Loial
explained. He looked at the darkness surrounding them, and his head
sunk in between his shoulders. &ldquo;None alive know more than
fragments. I fear what I don&rsquo;t know about the Ways, Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Dark One,&rdquo; Lan said, &ldquo;cannot be defeated without
chancing risks. But we are alive at this moment, and before us is
the hope of remaining alive. Do not surrender before you are
beaten, Ogier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would not speak so confidently if you had ever
been in the Ways.&rdquo; The normal distant thunder of Loial&rsquo;s voice was
muted. He stared at the blackness as if he saw things there. &ldquo;I
never have before, either, but I&rsquo;ve seen Ogier who have been
through a Waygate and come out again. You would not speak so if you
had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat stepped through the gate and regained normal
speed. For an instant he stared at the seemingly endless darkness,
then came running to join them, his lantern bobbing on its pole,
his horse leaping behind him, almost sending him sprawling. One by
one the others passed through, Perrin and Egwene and Nynaeve, each
pausing in shocked silence before hurrying to join the rest. Each
lantern enlarged the pool of light, but not as much as it should
have. It was as if the dark became denser the more light there was,
thickening as it fought against being diminished.</p>

<p>That was not a line of reasoning Rand wanted to
follow. It was bad enough just being there without giving the
darkness a will of its own. Everyone seemed to feel the
oppressiveness, though. There were no wry comments from Mat here,
and Egwene looked as if she wished she could rethink her decision
to come. They all silently watched the Waygate, that last window
into the world they knew.</p>

<p>Finally only Moiraine was left in the cellar, dimly
lit by the lantern she had taken. The Aes Sedai still moved in that
dreamlike way. Her hand crept as it found the leaf of
<em>Avendesora</em>. It was located lower in the stonework on this
side, Rand saw, just where she had placed it on the other. Plucking
it free, she put it back in the original position. He wondered
suddenly if the leaf on the other side had moved back, too.</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai came through, leading Aldieb, as the
stone gates slowly, slowly began closing behind her. She came to
join them, the light of her lantern leaving the gates before they
were shut. Blackness swallowed the narrowing view of the cellar. In
the constrained light of their lanterns, blackness surrounded them
totally.</p>

<p>Suddenly it seemed as if the lanterns were the only
light left in the world. Rand realized that he was jammed
shoulder-to-shoulder in between Perrin and Egwene. Egwene gave him
a wide-eyed look and pressed closer, and Perrin made no move to
give him room. There was something comforting about touching
another human being when the whole world had just been swallowed up
by dark. Even the horses seemed to feel the Ways pushing them into
a tighter and tighter knot.</p>

<p>Outwardly unconcerned, Moiraine and Lan swung into
their saddles, and the Aes Sedai leaned forward, arms resting on
her carved staff across the high pommel of her saddle. &ldquo;We must be
on our way, Loial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial gave a start, and nodded vigorously. &ldquo;Yes. Yes,
Aes Sedai, you are right. Not a minute longer than need be.&rdquo; He
pointed to a broad strip of white running under their feet, and
Rand stepped away from it hastily. All the Two Rivers folk did.
Rand thought the floor had been smooth once, but the smoothness was
pitted now, as if the stone had the pox. The white line was broken
in several places. &ldquo;This leads from the Waygate to the first
Guiding. From there&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Loial looked around anxiously, then
scrambled onto his horse with none of the reluctance he had shown
earlier. The horse wore the biggest saddle the head groom had been
able to find, but Loial filled it from pommel to cantle. His feet
hung down on either side almost to the animal&rsquo;s knees. &ldquo;Not a
minute longer than need be,&rdquo; he muttered. Reluctantly the others
mounted.</p>

<p>Moiraine and Lan rode on either side of the Ogier,
following the white line through the dark. Everyone else crowded in
behind as close as they could get, the lanterns bobbing over their
heads. The lanterns should have given enough light to fill a house,
but ten feet away from them it stopped. The blackness stopped it as
if it had struck a wall. The creak of saddles and click of
horseshoes on stone seemed to travel only to the edge of light.</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s hand kept drifting to his sword. It was not
that he thought there was anything out there against which he could
use the sword to defend himself; it did not seem as if there was
anywhere for something to be. The bubble of light around them could
as well have been a cave surrounded by stone, completely
surrounded, with no way out. The horses might have been walking a
treadmill for the change around them. He gripped the hilt as if the
pressure of his hand there could press away the stone he felt
weighing down on him. Touching the sword, he could remember Tam&rsquo;s
teaching. For a little while he could find the calm of the void.
But the weight always returned, compressing the void until it was
only a cavern inside his mind, and he had to start over again,
touching Tam&rsquo;s sword to remember.</p>

<p>It was a relief when something did change, even if it
was only a tall slab of stone, standing on end, that appeared out
of the dark before them, the broad white line stopping at its base.
Sinuous curves of metal inlaid the wide surface, graceful lines
that vaguely reminded Rand of vines and leaves. Discolored pocks
marked stone and metal alike.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Guiding,&rdquo; Loial said, and leaned out of his
saddle to frown at the cursive metal inlays.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ogier script,&rdquo; Moiraine said, &ldquo;but so broken I can
barely make out what it says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hardly can, either,&rdquo; Loial said, &ldquo;but enough to
know we go this way.&rdquo; He turned his horse aside from the
Guiding.</p>

<p>The edges of their light caught other stoneworks,
what appeared to be stone-walled bridges arcing off into the
darkness, and gently sloping ramps, without railings of any kind,
leading up and down. Between the bridges and the ramps ran a
chest-high balustrade, however, as though falling was a danger
there at any rate. Plain white stone made the balustrade, in simple
curves and rounds fitted together in complex patterns. Something
about all of it seemed almost familiar to Rand, but he knew it had
to be his imagination groping for anything familiar where
everything was strange.</p>

<p>At the foot of one of the bridges Loial paused to
read the single line on the narrow column stone there. Nodding, he
rode up onto the bridge. &ldquo;This is the first bridge of our path,&rdquo; he
said over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Rand wondered what held the bridge up. The horses&rsquo;
hooves made a gritty sound, as if bits of stone flaked off at every
step. Everything he could see was covered with shallow holes, some
tiny pinpricks, others shallow, rough-edged craters a stride
across, as if there had been a rain of acid, or the stone was
rotting. The guardwall showed cracks and holes, too. In places it
was gone altogether for as much as a span. For all he knew the
bridge could be solid stone all the way to the center of the earth,
but what he saw made him hope it would stand long enough for them
to reach the other end. <em>Wherever that is</em>.</p>

<p>The bridge did end, eventually, in a place that
looked no different from its beginning. All Rand could see was what
their little pool of light touched, but he had the impression that
it was a large space, like a flat-topped hill, with bridges and
ramps leaving all around it. An Island, Loial called it. There was
another script-covered Guiding&mdash;Rand placed it in the middle
of the Island, with no way of knowing if he was right or not. Loial
read, then took them up one of the ramps, curving up and up.</p>

<p>After an interminable climb, curving continuously,
the ramp let off onto another Island just like the one where it had
begun. Rand tried to imagine the curve of the ramp and gave up.
<em>This Island can&rsquo;t be right on top of the other one. It</em>
can&rsquo;t <em>be</em>.</p>

<p>Loial consulted yet another slab filled with Ogier
script, found another signpost column, led them onto another
bridge. Rand no longer had any idea in what direction they were
traveling.</p>

<p>In their huddle of light in the dark, one bridge was
exactly like another, except that some had breaks in the guardwalls
and some did not. Only the degree of damage to the Guidings gave
any difference to the Islands. Rand lost track of time; he was not
even sure how many bridges they had crossed or how many ramps they
had traveled. The Warder must have had a clock in his head, though.
Just when Rand felt the first stir of hunger, Lan announced quietly
that it was midday and dismounted to parcel out bread and cheese
and dried meat from the packhorse. Perrin was leading the animal by
that time. They were on an Island, and Loial was busily deciphering
the directions on the Guiding.</p>

<p>Mat started to climb down from his saddle, but
Moiraine said, &ldquo;Time is too valuable in the Ways to waste. For us,
much too valuable. We will stop when it is time to sleep.&rdquo; Lan was
already back on Mandarb.</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s appetite slipped at the thought of sleeping in
the Ways. It was always night there, but not the kind of night for
sleeping. He ate while he rode, though, like everyone else. It was
an awkward affair, trying to juggle his food, the lantern pole, and
his reins, but for all of his imagined lack of appetite he licked
the last crumbs of bread and cheese off his hands when he was done,
and thought fondly of more. He even began to think the Ways were
not so bad, not nearly as bad as Loial made out. They might have
the heavy feel of the hour before a storm, but nothing changed.
Nothing happened. The Ways were almost boring.</p>

<p>Then the silence was broken by a startled grunt from
Loial. Rand stood in his stirrups to peer past the Ogier, and
swallowed hard at what he saw. They were in the middle of a bridge,
and only a few feet ahead of Loial the bridge ended in a jagged
gap.</p>
