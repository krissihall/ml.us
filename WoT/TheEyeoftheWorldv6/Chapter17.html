the Wisdom left him, Rand made his way to the common room.
He needed to hear people laughing, to forget what Nynaeve had said
and the trouble she might cause alike.</p>

<p>The room was crowded indeed, but no one was laughing, though
every chair and bench was filled and people lined the walls. Thom
was performing again, standing on a table against the far wall, his
gestures grand enough to fill the big room. It was <em>The Great Hunt
of the Horn</em> again, but no one complained, of course. There were so
many tales to be told about each of the Hunters, and so many
Hunters to tell of, that no two tellings were ever the same. The
whole of it in one telling would have taken a week or more. The
only sound competing with the gleeman&rsquo;s voice and harp was the
crackling of the fires in the fireplaces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;To the eight corners of the world, the Hunters ride, to
the eight pillars of heaven, where the winds of time blow and fate
seizes the mighty and the small alike by the forelock. Now, the
greatest of the Hunters is Rogosh of Talmour, Rogosh Eagle-eye,
famed at the court of the High King, feared on the slopes of Shayol
Ghul&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; The Hunters were always mighty heroes, all of them.</p>

<p>Rand spotted his two friends and squeezed onto a place Perrin
made for him on the end of their bench. Kitchen smells drifting
into the room reminded him that he was hungry, but even the people
who had food in front of them gave it little attention. The maids
who should have been serving stood entranced, clutching their
aprons and looking at the gleeman, and nobody seemed to mind at
all. Listening was better than eating, no matter how good the
food.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;since the day of her birth has the Dark One marked Blaes
as his own,
