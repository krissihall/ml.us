<h4><em>The Wheel Turns</em></h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">D</span>awn
revealed devastation in the Green Man&rsquo;s garden.
The ground was thick with fallen leaves, almost knee-deep in
places. All the flowers were gone except a few clinging desperately
to the edge of the clearing. Little could grow in the soil under an
oak, but a thin circle of flowers and grass centered on the thick
trunk above the Green Man&rsquo;s grave. The oak itself retained only
half its leaves, and that was far more than any other tree had, as
if some remnant of the Green Man still fought to hold there. The
cool breezes had died, replaced by a growing sticky heat, the
butterflies were gone, the birds silent. It was a silent group who
prepared to leave.</p>

<p>Rand climbed into the bay&rsquo;s saddle with a sense of
loss. <em>It shouldn&rsquo;t be this way. Blood and ashes, we
won!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish he had found his other place,&rdquo; Egwene said as
she mounted Bela. A litter, fashioned by Lan, was slung between the
shaggy mare and Aldieb, to carry Moiraine; Nynaeve would ride
beside with the white mare&rsquo;s reins. The Wisdom dropped her eyes
whenever she saw Lan glance at her, avoiding his gaze; the Warder
looked at her whenever her eyes were averted, but he would not
speak to her. No one had to ask who Egwene meant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not right,&rdquo; Loial said, staring at the oak.
The Ogier was the only one still not mounted. &ldquo;It is not right that
Treebrother should fall to the Blight.&rdquo; He handed the reins of his
big horse to Rand. &ldquo;Not right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan opened his mouth as the Ogier walked to the great
oak. Moiraine, lying on the litter, weakly raised her hand, and the
Warder said nothing.</p>

<p>Before the oak, Loial knelt, closing his eyes and
stretching out his arms. The tufts on his ears stood straight as he
lifted his face to the sky. And he sang.</p>

<p>Rand could not say if there were words, or if it was
pure song. In that rumbling voice it was as if the earth sang, yet
he was sure he heard the birds trilling again, and spring breezes
sighing softly, and the sound of butterfly wings. Lost in the song,
he thought it lasted only minutes, but when Loial lowered his arms
and opened his eyes, he was surprised to see the sun stood well
above the horizon. It had been touching the trees when the Ogier
began. The leaves still on the oak seemed greener, and more firmly
attached than before. The flowers encircling it stood straighter,
the morningstars white and fresh, the loversknots a strong
crimson.</p>

<p>Mopping sweat from his broad face, Loial rose and
took his reins from Rand. His long eyebrows drooped, abashed, as if
they might think he had been showing off. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never sung so hard
before. I could not have done it if something of Treebrother was
not still there. My Treesongs do not have his power.&rdquo; When he
settled himself in his saddle, there was satisfaction in the look
he gave the oak and the flowers. &ldquo;This little space, at least, will
not sink into the Blight. The Blight will not have
Treebrother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a good man, Ogier,&rdquo; Lan said.</p>

<p>Loial grinned. &ldquo;I will take that as a compliment, but
I do not know what Elder Haman would say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They rode in a single file, with Mat behind the
Warder where he could use his bow to effect if needed, and Perrin
bringing up the rear with his axe across the pommel of his saddle.
They crested a hill, and in an eyeblink the Blight was all around
them, twisted and rotted in virulent rainbow hues. Rand looked over
his shoulder, but the Green Man&rsquo;s garden was nowhere to be seen.
Only the Blight stretching behind them as before. Yet he thought,
just for a moment, that he saw the towering top of the oak tree,
green and lush, before it shimmered and was gone. Then there was
only the Blight.</p>

<p>He half expected they would have to fight their way
out as they fought their way in, but the Blight was as quiet and
still as death. Not a single branch trembled as if to lash at them,
nothing screamed or howled, neither nearby nor in the distance. The
Blight seemed to crouch, not to pounce, but as if it had been
struck a great blow and waited for the next to fall. Even the sun
was less red.</p>

<p>When they passed the necklace of lakes, the sun hung
not far past its zenith. Lan kept them well away from the lakes and
did not even look at them, but Rand thought the seven towers seemed
taller than when he first saw them. He was sure the jagged tops
were further from the ground, and above them something almost seen,
seamless towers gleaming in the sun, and banners with Golden Cranes
flying on the wind. He blinked and stared, but the towers refused
to vanish completely. They were there at the edge of vision until
the Blight hid the lakes once more.</p>

<p>Before sunset the Warder chose a campsite, and
Moiraine had Nynaeve and Egwene help her up to set wards. The Aes
Sedai whispered in the other women&rsquo;s ears before she began. Nynaeve
hesitated, but when Moiraine closed her eyes, all three women did
so together.</p>

<p>Rand saw Mat and Perrin staring, and wondered how
they could be surprised. <em>Every woman is an Aes Sedai</em>, he
thought mirthlessly. <em>The Light help me, so am I</em>. Bleakness
held his tongue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why is it so different?&rdquo; Perrin asked as Egwene and
the Wisdom helped Moiraine to her bed. &ldquo;It feels&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; His thick
shoulders shrugged as if he could not find the word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We struck a mighty blow at the Dark One,&rdquo; Moiraine
replied, settling herself with a sigh. &ldquo;The Shadow will be a long
time recovering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; Mat demanded. &ldquo;What did we do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sleep,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;We are not out of the Blight
yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the next morning, still nothing changed that Rand
could see. The Blight faded as they rode south, of course. Twisted
trees were replaced by straight. The stifling heat diminished.
Rotting foliage gave way to the merely diseased. And then not
diseased, he realized. The forest around them became red with new
growth, thick on the branches. Buds sprouted on the undergrowth,
creepers covered the rocks with green, and new wildflowers dotted
the grass as thick and bright as where the Green Man walked. It was
as if spring, so long held back by winter, now raced to catch up to
where it should be.</p>

<p>He was not the only one who stared. &ldquo;A mighty blow,&rdquo;
Moiraine murmured, and would say no more.</p>

<p>Climbing wildrose entwined the stone column marking
the Border. Men came out of the watchtowers to greet them. There
was a stunned quality to their laughter, and their eyes shone with
amazement, as if they could not believe the new grass under their
steel-clad feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light has conquered the Shadow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A great victory in Tarwin&rsquo;s Gap! We have had the
message! Victory!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light blesses us again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;King Easar is strong in the Light,&rdquo; Lan replied to
all their shouts.</p>

<p>The watchmen wanted to tend Moiraine, or at least
send an escort with them, but she refused it all. Even flat on her
back on a litter, the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s presence was such that the
armored men fell back, bowing and acceding to her wishes. Their
laughter followed as Rand and the others rode on.</p>

<p>In the late afternoon they reached Fal Dara, to find
the grim-walled city ringing with celebration. Ringing in truth.
Rand doubted if there could be a bell in the city not clanging,
from the tiniest silver harness chime to great bronze gongs in
their tower tops. The gates stood wide open, and men ran laughing
and singing in the streets, flowers stuck in their topknots and the
crevices of their armor. The common people of the town had not yet
returned from Fal Moran, but the soldiers were newly come from
Tarwin&rsquo;s Gap, and their joy was enough to fill the streets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Victory in the Gap! We won!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A miracle in the Gap! The Age of Legends has come
back!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spring!&rdquo; a grizzled old soldier laughed as he hung a
garland of morningstars around Rand&rsquo;s neck. His own topknot was a
white cluster of them. &ldquo;The Light blesses us with spring once
more!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Learning they wanted to go to the keep, a circle of
men clad in steel and flowers surrounded them, running to clear a
way through the celebration.</p>

<p>Ingtar&rsquo;s was the first face Rand saw that was not
smiling. &ldquo;I was too late,&rdquo; Ingtar told Lan with a sour grimness.
&ldquo;Too late by an hour to see. Peace!&rdquo; His teeth ground audibly, but
then his expression became contrite. &ldquo;Forgive me. Grief makes me
forget my duties. Welcome, Builder. Welcome to you all. It is good
to see you safely out of the Blight. I will bring the healer to
Moiraine Sedai in her chambers, and inform Lord Agelmar&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take me to Lord Agelmar,&rdquo; Moiraine commanded. &ldquo;Take
us all.&rdquo; Ingtar opened his mouth to protest, and bowed under the
force of her eyes.</p>

<p>Agelmar was in his study, with his swords and armor
back on their racks, and his was the second face that did not
smile. He wore a troubled frown that deepened when he saw Moiraine
carried in on her litter by liveried servants. Women in the
black-and-gold fluttered over bringing the Aes Sedai to him without
a chance to freshen herself or be brought the healer. Loial carried
the gold chest. The pieces of the seal were still in Moiraine&rsquo;s
pouch; Lews Therin Kinslayer&rsquo;s banner was wrapped in her
blanketroll and still tied behind Aldieb&rsquo;s saddle. The groom who
had led the white mare away had received the strictest orders to
see the blanketroll was placed untouched in the chambers assigned
to the Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; the Lord of Fal Dara muttered. &ldquo;Are you
injured, Moiraine Sedai? Ingtar, why have you not seen the Aes
Sedai to her bed and brought the healer to her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be still, Lord Agelmar,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;Ingtar has
done as I commanded him. I am not so frail as everyone here seems
to think.&rdquo; She motioned two of the women to help her to a chair.
For a moment they clasped their hands, exclaiming that she was too
weak, that she should be in a warm bed, and the healer brought, and
a hot bath. Moiraine&rsquo;s eyebrows lifted; the women shut their mouths
abruptly and hurried to aid her into the chair. As soon as she was
settled she waved them away irritably. &ldquo;I would speak with you,
Lord Agelmar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Agelmar nodded, and Ingtar waved the servants from
the room. The Lord of Fal Dara eyed those who remained expectantly;
especially, Rand thought, Loial and the golden chest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We hear,&rdquo; Moiraine said as soon as the door shut
behind Ingtar, &ldquo;that you won a great victory in Tarwin&rsquo;s Gap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Agelmar said slowly, his troubled frown
returning. &ldquo;Yes, Aes Sedai, and no. The Halfmen and their Trollocs
were destroyed to the last, but we barely fought. A miracle, my men
call it. The earth swallowed them; the mountains buried them. Only
a few Draghkar were left, too frightened to do else but fly north
as fast as they could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A miracle indeed,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;And spring has
come again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A miracle,&rdquo; Agelmar said, shaking his head, &ldquo;but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Moiraine Sedai, men say many things about what happened in the
Gap. That the Light took on flesh and fought for us. That the
Creator walked in the Gap to strike at the Shadow. But I saw a man,
Moiraine Sedai. I saw a man, and what he did, cannot be, must not
be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills, Lord of Fal
Dara.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you say, Moiraine Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Padan Fain? He is secure? I must speak with him
when I am rested.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is held as you commanded, Aes Sedai, whining at
his guards half the time and trying to command them the rest, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Peace, Moiraine Sedai, what of you, in the Blight? You found
the Green Man? I see his hand in the new things growing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We found him,&rdquo; she said flatly. &ldquo;The Green Man is
dead, Lord Agelmar, and the Eye of the World is gone. There will be
no more quests by young men seeking glory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Lord of Fal Dara frowned, shaking his head in
confusion. &ldquo;Dead? The Green Man? He cannot be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Then you were
defeated? But the flowers, and the growing things?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We won, Lord Agelmar. We won, and the land freed
from winter is the proof, but I fear the last battle has not yet
been fought.&rdquo; Rand stirred, but the Aes Sedai gave him a sharp look
and he stood still again. &ldquo;The Blight still stands, and the forges
of Thakan&rsquo;dar still work below Shayol Ghul. There are many Halfmen
yet, and countless Trollocs. Never think the need for watchfulness
in the Borderlands is gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not think it so, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; he said
stiffly.</p>

<p>Moiraine motioned for Loial to set the gold chest at
her feet, and when he did, she opened it, revealing the horn. &ldquo;The
Horn of Valere,&rdquo; she said, and Agelmar gasped. Rand almost thought
the man would kneel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With that, Moiraine Sedai, it matters not how many
Halfmen or Trollocs remain. With the heroes of old come back from
the tomb, we will march to the Blasted Lands and level Shayol Ghul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;NO!&rdquo; Agelmar&rsquo;s mouth fell open in surprise, but
Moiraine continued calmly. &ldquo;I did not show it to you to taunt you,
but so that you will know that in whatever battles yet come, our
might will be as great as that of the Shadow. Its place is not
here. The Horn must be carried to Illian. It is there, if fresh
battles threaten, that it must rally the forces of the Light. I
will ask an escort of your best men to see that it reaches Illian
safely. There are Darkfriends still, as well as Halfmen and
Trollocs, and those who come to the horn will follow whoever winds
it. It must reach Illian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It shall be as you say, Aes Sedai.&rdquo; But when the lid
of the chest closed, the Lord of Fal Dara looked like a man being
denied his last glimpse of the Light.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Seven days later, bells still rang in Fal Dara. The
people had returned from Fal Moran, adding their celebration to
that of the soldiers, and shouts and singing blended with the
pealing of the bells on the long balcony where Rand stood. The
balcony overlooked Agelmar&rsquo;s private gardens, green and flowering,
but he did not give them a second look. Despite the sun high in the
sky, spring in Shienar was cooler than he was used to, yet sweat
glistened on his bare chest and shoulders as he swung the
heron-mark blade, each move precise yet distant from where he
floated in the void. Even there, he wondered how much joy there
would be in the town if they knew of the banner Moiraine still kept
hidden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good, sheepherder.&rdquo; Leaning against the railing with
his arms folded across his chest, the Warder watched him
critically. &ldquo;You are doing well, but don&rsquo;t push so hard. You can&rsquo;t
become a blademaster in a few weeks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The void vanished like a pricked bubble. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
care about being a blademaster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a blademaster&rsquo;s blade, sheepherder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just want my father to be proud of me.&rdquo; His hand
tightened on the rough leather of the hilt. <em>I just want Tam to
be my father</em>. He slammed the sword into its scabbard. &ldquo;Anyway,
I don&rsquo;t have a few weeks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve not changed your mind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you?&rdquo; Lan&rsquo;s expression had not altered; the
flat planes of his face looked as if they could not change. &ldquo;You
won&rsquo;t try to stop me? Or Moiraine Sedai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can do as you will, sheepherder, or as the
Pattern weaves for you.&rdquo; The Warder straightened. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave you
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand turned to watch Lan go, and found Egwene
standing there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Changed your mind about what, Rand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He snatched up his shirt and coat, suddenly feeling
the cool. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going away, Egwene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somewhere. I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; He did not want to meet
her eyes, but he could not stop looking at her. She wore red
wildroses twined in her hair, flowing about her shoulders. She held
her cloak close, dark blue and embroidered along the edge with a
thin line of white flowers in the Shienaran fashion, and the
blossoms made a line straight up to her face. They were no paler
than her cheeks; her eyes seemed so large and dark. &ldquo;Away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Moiraine Sedai will not like you just going
off. After&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;after what you&rsquo;ve done, you deserve some
reward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moiraine does not know I am alive. I have done what
she wanted, and that&rsquo;s an end to it. She doesn&rsquo;t even speak to me
when I go to her. Not that I&rsquo;ve tried to stay close to her, but
she&rsquo;s avoided me. She won&rsquo;t care if I go, and I don&rsquo;t care if she
does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moiraine is still not completely well, Rand.&rdquo; She
hesitated. &ldquo;I have to go to Tar Valon for my training. Nynaeve is
coming, too. And Mat still needs to be Healed of whatever binds him
to that dagger, and Perrin wants to see Tar Valon before he goes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;wherever. You could come with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And wait for some Aes Sedai besides Moiraine to find
out what I am and gentle me?&rdquo; His voice was rough, almost a sneer;
he could not change it. &ldquo;Is that what you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He knew he would never be able to tell her how
grateful he was that she had not hesitated before answering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand, you aren&rsquo;t afraid&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; They were alone, but
she looked around and still lowered her voice. &ldquo;Moiraine Sedai says
you don&rsquo;t have to touch the True Source. If you don&rsquo;t touch
<em>saidin</em>, if you don&rsquo;t try to wield the Power, you&rsquo;ll be
safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I won&rsquo;t ever touch it again. Not if I have to
cut my hand off, first.&rdquo; <em>What if I can&rsquo;t stop? I never tried to
wield it, not even at the Eye. What if I can&rsquo;t stop?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you go home, Rand? Your father must be dying to
see you. Even Mat&rsquo;s father must be dying to see him by now. I&rsquo;ll be
coming back to Emond&rsquo;s Field next year. For a little while, at
least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He rubbed his palm over the hilt of his sword,
feeling the bronze heron. <em>My father. Home. Light, how I want to
see</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;Not home.&rdquo; <em>Someplace where there aren&rsquo;t any
people to hurt if I can&rsquo;t stop myself. Somewhere alone</em>.
Suddenly it felt as cold as snow on the balcony. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going away,
but not home.&rdquo; <em>Egwene, Egwene, why did you have to be one of
those</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>?</em> He put his arms around her, and
whispered into her hair. &ldquo;Not ever home.&rdquo;</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">In Agelmar&rsquo;s private garden, under a thick bower
dotted with white blossoms, Moiraine shifted on her bedchair. The
fragments of the seal lay on her lap, and the small gem she
sometimes wore in her hair spun and glittered on its gold chain
from the ends of her fingers. The faint blue glow faded from the
stone, and a smile touched her lips. It had no power in itself, the
stone, but the first use she had ever learned of the One Power, as
a girl, in the Royal Palace in Cairhien, was using the stone to
listen to people when they thought they were too far off to be
overheard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Prophecies will be fulfilled,&rdquo; the Aes Sedai
whispered. &ldquo;The Dragon is Reborn.&rdquo;</p>
