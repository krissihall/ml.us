<h4><em>Four Kings in Shadow</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
village was bigger than most, but still a scruffy
town to bear a name like Four Kings. As usual, the Caemlyn Road ran
straight through the center of the town, but another heavily
traveled highway came in from the south, too. Most villages were
markets and gathering places for the farmers of the area, but there
were few farmers to be seen here. Four Kings survived as a stopover
for merchants&rsquo; wagon trains on their way to Caemlyn and to the
mining towns in the Mountains of Mist beyond Baerlon, as well as
the villages between. The southern road carried Lugard&rsquo;s trade with
the mines in the west; Lugarder merchants going to Caemlyn had a
more direct route. The surrounding country held few farms, barely
enough to feed themselves and the town, and everything in the
village centered on the merchants and their wagons, the men who
drove them and the laborers who loaded the goods.</p>

<p>Plots of bare earth, ground to dust, lay scattered
through Four Kings, filled with wagons parked wheel to wheel and
abandoned except for a few bored guards. Stables and horse-lots
lined the streets, all of which were wide enough to allow wagons to
pass and deeply rutted from too many wheels. There was no village
green, and the children played in the ruts, dodging wagons and the
curses of wagon drivers. Village women, their heads covered with
scarves, kept their eyes down and walked quickly, sometimes
followed by wagoneers&rsquo; comments that made Rand blush; even Mat gave
a start at some of them. No woman stood gossiping over the fence
with a neighbor. Drab wooden houses stood cheek by jowl, with only
narrow alleys between and whitewash&mdash;where anyone had
bothered to whitewash the weathered boards&mdash;faded as if it
had not been freshened in years. Heavy shutters on the houses had
not been open in so long that the hinges were solid lumps of rust.
Noise hung over everything, clanging from blacksmiths, shouts from
the wagon drivers, raucous laughter from the town&rsquo;s inns.</p>

<p>Rand swung down from the back of a merchant&rsquo;s
canvas-topped wagon as they came abreast of a garishly painted inn,
all greens and yellows that caught the eye from afar among the
leaden houses. The line of wagons kept moving. None of the drivers
even seemed to notice that he and Mat had gone; dusk was falling,
and they all had their eyes on unhitching the horses and reaching
the inns. Rand stumbled in a rut, then leaped quickly to avoid a
heavy-laden wagon clattering the other way. The driver shouted a
curse at him as the wagon rolled by. A village woman stepped around
him and hurried on without ever meeting his eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about this place,&rdquo; he said. He thought
he could hear music mixed in the din, but he could not tell from
where it was coming. From the inn, maybe, but it was hard to be
sure. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it. Maybe we&rsquo;d better go on this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat gave him a scornful look, then rolled his eyes at
the sky. Dark clouds thickened overhead. &ldquo;And sleep under a hedge
tonight? In that? I&rsquo;m used to a bed again.&rdquo; He cocked his head to
listen, then grunted. &ldquo;Maybe one of these places doesn&rsquo;t have
musicians. Anyway, I&rsquo;ll bet they don&rsquo;t have a juggler.&rdquo; He slung
his bow across his shoulders and started for the bright yellow
door, studying everything through narrowed eyes. Rand followed
doubtfully.</p>

<p>There were musicians inside, their zither and drum
almost drowned in coarse laughter and drunken shouting. Rand did
not bother to find the landlord. The next two inns had musicians as
well, and the same deafening cacophony. Roughly dressed men filled
the tables and stumbled across the floor, waving mugs and trying to
fondle serving maids who dodged with fixed, long-suffering smiles.
The buildings shook with the racket, and the smell was sour, a
stench of old wine and unwashed bodies. Of the merchants, in their
silk and velvet and lace, there was no sign; private dining rooms
abovestairs protected their ears and noses. He and Mat only put
their heads in the doors before leaving. He was beginning to think
they would have no choice but to move on.</p>

<p>The fourth inn, The Dancing Cartman, stood
silent.</p>

<p>It was as gaudy as the other inns, yellow trimmed in
bright red and bilious, eye-wrenching green, though here the paint
was cracked and peeling. Rand and Mat stepped inside.</p>

<p>Only half a dozen men sat at the tables that filled
the common room, hunched over their mugs, each one glumly alone
with his thoughts. Business was definitely not good, but it had
been better once. Exactly as many serving maids as there were
patrons busied themselves around the room. There was plenty for
them to do&mdash;dirt crusted the floor and cobwebs filled the
corners of the ceiling&mdash;but most were not doing anything
really useful, only moving so they would not be seen standing
still.</p>

<p>A bony man with long, stringy hair to his shoulders
turned to scowl at them as they came through the door. The first
slow peal of thunder rumbled across Four Kings. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;
He was rubbing his hands on a greasy apron that hung to his ankles.
Rand wondered if more grime was coming off on the apron or on the
man&rsquo;s hands. He was the first skinny innkeeper Rand had seen.
&ldquo;Well? Speak up, buy a drink, or get out! Do I look like a raree
show?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flushing, Rand launched into the spiel he had
perfected at inns before this. &ldquo;I play the flute, and my friend
juggles, and you&rsquo;ll not see two better in a year. For a good room
and a good meal, we&rsquo;ll fill this common room of yours.&rdquo; He
remembered the filled common rooms he had already seen that
evening, especially the man who had vomited right in front of him
at the last one. He had had to step lively to keep his boots
untouched. He faltered, but caught himself and went on. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fill
your inn with men who will repay the little we cost twenty times
over with the food and drink they buy. Why should&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a man plays the dulcimer,&rdquo; the innkeeper
said sourly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a drunk, Saml Hake,&rdquo; one of the serving
maids said. She was passing him with a tray and two mugs, and she
paused to give Rand and Mat a plump smile. &ldquo;Most times, he can&rsquo;t
see well enough to find the common room,&rdquo; she confided in a loud
whisper. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t even seen him in two days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without taking his eyes off Rand and Mat, Hake
casually backhanded her across the face. She gave a surprised grunt
and fell heavily to the unwashed floor; one of the mugs broke, and
the spilled wine washed rivulets in the dirt. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re docked for
the wine and breakage. Get &rsquo;em fresh drinks. And hurry. Men don&rsquo;t
pay to wait while you laze around.&rdquo; His tone was as offhand as the
blow. None of the patrons looked up from their wine, and the other
serving maids kept their eyes averted.</p>

<p>The plump woman rubbed her cheek and stared pure
murder at Hake, but she gathered the empty mug and the broken
pieces on her tray and went off without a word.</p>

<p>Hake sucked his teeth thoughtfully, eyeing Rand and
Mat. His gaze clung to the heron-mark sword before he pulled it
away. &ldquo;Tell you what,&rdquo; he said finally. &ldquo;You can have a couple of
pallets in an empty storeroom in the back. Rooms are too expensive
to give away. You eat when everybody&rsquo;s gone. There ought to be
something left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand wished there was an inn in Four Kings they had
not yet tried. Since leaving Whitebridge he had met coolness,
indifference, and outright hostility, but nothing that gave him the
sense of unease that this man and this village did. He told himself
it was just the dirt and squalor and noise, but the misgivings did
not go away. Mat was watching Hake as if he suspected some trap,
but he gave no sign of wanting to give up The Dancing Cartman for a
bed under a hedge. Thunder rattled the windows. Rand Sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pallets will do if they&rsquo;re clean, and if there
are enough clean blankets. But we eat two hours after full dark, no
later, and the best you have. Here. We&rsquo;ll show you what we can do.&rdquo;
He reached for the flute case, but Hake shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t matter. This lot&rsquo;ll be satisfied with any kind
of screeching so long as it sounds something like music.&rdquo; His eyes
touched Rand&rsquo;s sword again; his thin smile touched nothing but his
lips. &ldquo;Eat when you want, but if you don&rsquo;t bring the crowd in, out
you go in the street.&rdquo; He nodded over his shoulder at two
hard-faced men sitting against the wall. They were not drinking,
and their arms were thick enough for legs. When Hake nodded at
them, their eyes shifted to Rand and Mat, flat and
expressionless.</p>

<p>Rand put one hand on his sword hilt, hoping the
twisting in his stomach did not show on his face. &ldquo;As long as we
get what&rsquo;s agreed on,&rdquo; he said in a level tone.</p>

<p>Hake blinked, and for a moment he seemed uneasy
himself. Abruptly he nodded. &ldquo;What I said, isn&rsquo;t it? Well, get
started. You won&rsquo;t bring anybody in just standing there.&rdquo; He
stalked off, scowling and shouting at the serving maids as if there
were fifty customers they were neglecting.</p>

<p>There was a small, raised platform at the far end of
the room, near the door to the back. Rand lifted a bench up on it,
and settled his cloak, blanketroll, and Thom&rsquo;s bundled cloak behind
the bench with the sword lying atop them.</p>

<p>He wondered if he had been wise to keep wearing the
sword openly. Swords were common enough, but the heron-mark
attracted attention and speculation. Not from everybody, but any
notice at all made him uncomfortable. He could be leaving a clear
trail for the Myrddraal&mdash;if Fades needed that kind of trail.
They did not seem to. In any case, he was reluctant to stop wearing
it. Tam had given it to him. His father. As long as he wore the
sword, there was still some connection between Tam and him, a
thread that gave him the right to still call Tam father. <em>Too
late now</em>, he thought. He was not sure what he meant, but he
was sure it was true. <em>Too late</em>.</p>

<p>At the first note of &ldquo;Cock o&rsquo; the North&rdquo; the
half-dozen patrons in the common room lifted their heads out of
their wine. Even the two bouncers sat forward a little. They all
applauded when he finished, including the two toughs, and once more
when Mat sent a shower of colored balls spinning through his hands.
Outside, the sky muttered again. The rain was holding off, but the
pressure of it was palpable; the longer it waited, the harder it
would fall.</p>

<p>Word spread, and by the time it was dark outside the
inn was packed full with men laughing and talking so loud that Rand
could barely hear what he was playing. Only the thunder overpowered
the noise in the common room. Lightning flashed in the windows, and
in the momentary lulls he could faintly hear rain drumming on the
roof. Men who came in now dripped trails across the floor.</p>

<p>Whenever he paused, voices shouted the names of tunes
through the din. A good many names he did not recognize, though
when he got someone to hum a bit of it, he often found he did know
the song. It had been that way other places, before. &ldquo;Jolly Jaim&rdquo;
was &ldquo;Rhea&rsquo;s Fling&rdquo; here, and had been &ldquo;Colors of the Sun&rdquo; at an
earlier stop. Some names stayed the same; others changed with ten
miles&rsquo; distance, and he had learned new songs, too. &ldquo;The Drunken
Peddler&rdquo; was a new one, though sometimes it was called &ldquo;Tinker in
the Kitchen.&rdquo; &ldquo;Two Kings Came Hunting&rdquo; was &ldquo;Two Horses Running&rdquo; and
several other names besides. He played the ones he knew, and men
pounded the tables for more.</p>

<p>Others called for Mat to juggle again. Sometimes
fights broke out between those wanting music and those who fancied
juggling. Once a knife flashed, and a woman screamed, and a man
reeled back from a table with blood streaming down his face, but
Jak and Strom, the two bouncers, closed in swiftly and with
complete impartiality threw everyone involved into the street with
lumps on their heads. That was their tactic with any trouble. The
talk and the laughing went on as if nothing had occurred. Nobody
even looked around except those the bouncers jostled on their way
to the door.</p>

<p>The patrons were free with their hands, too, when one
of the serving maids let herself grow unwary. More than once Jak or
Strom had to rescue one of the women, though they were none too
quick about it. The way Hake carried on, screaming and shaking the
woman involved, he always considered it her fault, and the teary
eyes and stammered apologies said she was willing to accept his
opinion. The women jumped whenever Hake frowned, even if he was
looking somewhere else. Rand wondered why any of them put up with
it.</p>

<p>Hake smiled when he looked at Rand and Mat. After a
while Rand realized Hake was not smiling at them; the smiles came
when his eyes slid behind them, to where the heron-mark sword lay.
Once, when Rand set the gold-and-silver-chased flute down beside
his stool, the flute got a smile, too.</p>

<p>The next time he changed places with Mat at the front
of the dais, he leaned over to speak in Mat&rsquo;s ear. Even that close
he had to speak loudly, but with all the noise he doubted if anyone
else could hear. &ldquo;Hake&rsquo;s going to try to rob us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat nodded as if it was nothing he had not expected.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to bar our door tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bar our door? Jak and Strom could break down a door
with their fists. Let&rsquo;s get out of here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait till after we eat, at least. I&rsquo;m hungry. They
can&rsquo;t do anything here,&rdquo; Mat added. The packed common room shouted
impatiently for them to get on with it. Hake was glaring at them.
&ldquo;Anyway, you want to sleep outside tonight?&rdquo; An especially strong
crack of lightning drowned out everything else, and for an instant
the light through the windows was stronger than the lamps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just want to get out without my head being
broken,&rdquo; Rand said, but Mat was already slouching back to take his
rest on the stool. Rand sighed and launched into &ldquo;The Road to Dun
Aren.&rdquo; A lot of them seemed to like that one; he had already played
it four times, and they still shouted for it.</p>

<p>The trouble was that Mat was right, as far as he
went. He was hungry, too. And he could not see how Hake could give
them any trouble while the common room was full, and getting
fuller. For every man who left or was thrown out by Jak and Strom,
two came in from the street. They shouted for the juggling or for a
particular tune, but mostly they were interested in drinking and
fondling the serving maids. One man was different, though.</p>

<p>He stood out in every way among the crowd in The
Dancing Cartman. Merchants apparently had no use for the run-down
inn; there were not even any private dining rooms for them, as far
as he could make out. The patrons were all rough-dressed, with the
tough skin of men who labored in the sun and wind. This man was
sleekly fleshy, with a soft look to his hands, and a velvet coat,
and a dark green velvet cloak lined with blue silk was slung around
his shoulders. All of his clothes had an expensive cut to them. His
shoes&mdash;soft velvet slippers, not boots&mdash;were not made
for the rutted streets of Four Kings, or for any streets at all,
for that matter.</p>

<p>He came in well after dark, shaking the rain off his
cloak as he looked around, a twist of distaste on his mouth. He
scanned the room once, already turning to go, then suddenly gave a
start at nothing Rand could see and sat down at a table Jak and
Strom had just emptied. A serving maid stopped at his table, then
brought him a mug of wine which he pushed to one side and never
touched again. She seemed in a hurry to leave his table both times,
though he did not try to touch her of even look at her. Whatever it
was about him that made her uneasy, others who came close to him
noticed it, too. For all of his soft look, whenever some
callus-handed wagon driver decided to share his table, one glance
was all it took to send the man looking elsewhere. He sat as if
there were no one else in the room but him&mdash;and Rand and Mat.
Them he watched over steepled hands that glittered with a ring on
each finger. He watched them with a smile of satisfied
recognition.</p>

<p>Rand murmured to Mat as they were changing places
again, and Mat nodded. &ldquo;I saw him,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Who is he? I keep
thinking I know him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The same thought had occurred to Rand, tickling the
back of his memory, but he could not bring it forward. Yet he was
sure that face was one he had never seen before.</p>

<p>When they had been performing for two hours, as near
as Rand could estimate, he slipped the flute into its case and he
and Mat gathered up their belongings. As they were stepping down
from the low platform, Hake came bustling up, anger twisting his
narrow face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to eat,&rdquo; Rand said to forestall him, &ldquo;and
we don&rsquo;t want our things stolen. You want to tell the cook?&rdquo; Hake
hesitated, still angry, trying unsuccessfully to keep his eyes off
what Rand held in his arms. Casually Rand shifted his bundles so he
could rest one hand on the sword. &ldquo;Or you can <em>try</em> throwing
us out.&rdquo; He made the emphasis deliberately, then added, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a
lot of night left for us to play, yet. We have to keep our strength
up if we&rsquo;re going to perform well enough to keep this crowd
spending money. How long do you think this room will stay full if
we fall over from hunger?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hake&rsquo;s eyes twitched over the room full of men
putting money in his pocket, then he turned and stuck his head
through the door to the rear of the inn. &ldquo;Feed &rsquo;em!&rdquo; he shouted.
Rounding on Rand and Mat, he snarled, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be all night about it.
I expect you up there till the last man&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some of the patrons were shouting for the musician
and the juggler, and Hake turned to soothe them. The man in the
velvet cloak was one of the anxious ones. Rand motioned Mat to
follow him.</p>

<p>A stout door separated the kitchen from the front of
the inn, and, except when it opened to let a serving maid through,
the rain pounding the roof was louder in the kitchen than the
shouts from the common room. It was a big room, hot and steamy from
stoves and ovens, with a huge table covered with half-prepared food
and dishes ready to be served. Some of the serving maids sat
clustered on a bench near the rear door, rubbing their feet and
chattering away all at once with the fat cook, who talked back at
the same time and waved a big spoon to emphasize her points. They
all glanced up as Rand and Mat came in, but it did not slow their
conversation or stop their foot rubbing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We ought to get out of here while we have the
chance,&rdquo; Rand said softly, but Mat shook his head, his eyes fixed
on the two plates the cook was filling with beef and potatoes and
peas. She hardly looked at the two of them, keeping up her talk
with the other women while she pushed things aside on the table
with her elbows and set the plates down, adding forks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After we eat is time enough.&rdquo; Mat slid onto a bench
and began using his fork as if it were a shovel.</p>

<p>Rand sighed, but he was right behind Mat. He had had
only a butt-end of bread to eat since the night before. His belly
felt as empty as a beggar&rsquo;s purse, and the cooking smells that
filled the kitchen did not help. He quickly had his mouth full,
though Mat was getting his plate refilled by the cook before he had
finished half of his.</p>

<p>He did not mean to eavesdrop on the women&rsquo;s talk, but
some of the words reached out and grabbed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sounds crazy to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crazy or not, it&rsquo;s what I hear. He went to half the
inns in town before he came here. Just walked in, looked around,
and walked out without saying one word, even at the Royal Inn. Like
it wasn&rsquo;t raining at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe he thought here was the most comfortable.&rdquo;
That brought gales of laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I hear is he didn&rsquo;t even get to Four Kings till
after nightfall, and his horses blowing like they&rsquo;d been pushed
hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d he come from, to get caught out after dark?
Nobody but a fool or a madman travels anywhere and plans it that
badly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe he&rsquo;s a fool, but he&rsquo;s a rich one. I hear
he even has another carriage for his servants and baggage. There&rsquo;s
money there, mark my words. Did you see that cloak of his? I
wouldn&rsquo;t mind having that my ownself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a little plump for my taste, but I always say a
man can&rsquo;t be too fat if enough gold comes with it.&rdquo; They all
doubled over giggling, and the cook threw back her head and roared
with laughter.</p>

<p>Rand dropped his fork on his plate. A thought he did
not like bubbled in his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in a minute,&rdquo; he said.
Mat barely nodded, stuffing a piece of potato into his mouth.</p>

<p>Rand picked up his sword belt along with his cloak as
he stood, and buckled it around his waist on the way to the back
door. No one paid him any mind.</p>

<p>The rain was bucketing down. He swung his cloak
around his shoulders and pulled the hood over his head, holding the
cloak closed as he trotted across the stableyard. A curtain of
water hid everything except when lightning flashed, but he found
what he was hunting. The horses had been taken into the stable, but
the two black-lacquered carriages glistened wetly outside. Thunder
grumbled, and a bolt of lightning streaked above the inn. In the
brief burst of light he made out a name in gold script on the coach
doors. Howal Gode.</p>

<p>Unmindful of the rain beating at him, he stood
staring at the name he could no longer see. He remembered where he
had last seen black-lacquered coaches with their owners&rsquo; names on
the door, and sleek, overfed men in silk-lined velvet cloaks and
velvet slippers. Whitebridge. A Whitebridge merchant could have a
perfectly legitimate reason to be on his way to Caemlyn. <em>A
reason that sends him to half the inns in town before he chooses
the one where you are? A reason that makes him look at you as if
he&rsquo;s found what he&rsquo;s searching for?</em></p>

<p>Rand shivered, and suddenly he was aware of rain
trickling down his back. His cloak was tightly woven, but it had
never been meant to stand up to this kind of downpour. He hurried
back to the inn, splashing through deepening puddles. Jak blocked
the door as he started through.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, well. Out here alone in the dark. Dark&rsquo;s
dangerous, boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rain slicked Rand&rsquo;s hair down across his forehead.
The stableyard was empty except for them. He wondered if Hake had
decided he wanted the sword and the flute badly enough to forgo
keeping the crowd in the common room.</p>

<p>Brushing water out of his eyes with one hand, he put
the other on his sword. Even wet, the nobby leather made a sure
grip for his fingers. &ldquo;Has Hake decided all those men will stay
just for his ale, instead of going where there&rsquo;s entertainment,
too? If he has, we&rsquo;ll call the meal even for what we&rsquo;ve done so far
and be on our way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dry in the doorway, the big man looked out at the
rain and snorted. &ldquo;In this?&rdquo; His eyes slid down to Rand&rsquo;s hand on
the sword. &ldquo;You know, me and Strom got a bet. He figures you stole
that from your old grandmother. Me, I figure your grandmother&rsquo;d
kick you round the pigpen and hang you out to dry.&rdquo; He grinned. His
teeth were crooked and yellow, and the grin made him look even
meaner. &ldquo;Night&rsquo;s long yet, boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand brushed past him, and Jak let him by with an
ugly chuckle.</p>

<p>Inside, he tossed off his cloak and dropped on the
bench at the table he had left only minutes before. Mat was done
with his second plate and working on a third, eating more slowly
now, but intently, as if he planned to finish every bite if it
killed him. Jak took up a place by the door to the stableyard,
leaning against the wall and watching them. Even the cook seemed to
feel no urge to talk with him there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s from Whitebridge,&rdquo; Rand said softly. There was
no need to say who &ldquo;he&rdquo; was. Mat&rsquo;s head swiveled toward him, a
piece of beef on the end of the fork suspended halfway to his
mouth. Conscious of Jak watching, Rand stirred the food on his
plate. He could not have gotten a mouthful down if he had been
starving, but he tried to pretend an interest in the peas as he
told Mat about the carriages, and what the women had said, in case
Mat had not been listening.</p>

<p>Obviously he had not been. Mat blinked in surprise
and whistled between his teeth, then frowned at the meat on his
fork and grunted as he tossed the fork onto his plate. Rand wished
he would make at least an effort to be circumspect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After us,&rdquo; Mat said when he finished. The creases in
Mat&rsquo;s forehead deepened. &ldquo;A Darkfriend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe. I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Rand glanced at Jak and the
big man stretched elaborately, shrugging shoulders as big as any
blacksmith&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Do you think we can get past him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not without him making enough noise to bring Hake
and the other one. I knew we should never have stopped here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand gaped, but before he could say anything Hake
pushed through the door from the common room. Strom bulked large
over his shoulder. Jak stepped in front of the back door. &ldquo;You
going to eat all night?&rdquo; Hake barked. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t feed you so you
could lie around out here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand looked at his friend. Later, Mat mouthed, and
they gathered their things under the watchful eyes of Hake, Strom,
and Jak.</p>

<p>In the common room, cries for juggling and the names
of tunes burst through the clamor as soon as Rand and Mat appeared.
The man in the velvet cloak&mdash;Howal Gode&mdash;still appeared
to ignore everyone around him, but he was nonetheless seated on the
edge of his chair. At the sight of them he leaned back, the
satisfied smile returning to his lips.</p>

<p>Rand took the first turn at the front of the dais,
playing &ldquo;Drawing Water From the Well&rdquo; with only half his mind on
it. No one seemed to notice the few wrong notes. He tried to think
of how they were going to get away, and tried to avoid looking at
Gode, too. If he was after them, there was no point in letting him
know they knew it. As for getting away&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He had never realized before what a good trap an inn
made. Hake, Jak, and Strom did not even have to keep a close eye on
them; the crowd would let them know if he or Mat left the dais. As
long as the common room was full of people, Hake could not send Jak
and Strom after them, but as long as the common room was full of
people they could not get away without Hake knowing. And Gode was
watching their every move, too. It was so funny he would have
laughed if he had not been on the point of throwing up. They would
just have to be wary and wait their chance.</p>

<p>When he changed places with Mat, Rand groaned to
himself. Mat glared at Hake, at Strom, at Jak, without a care to
whether they noticed or wondered why. When he was not actually
handling the balls, his hand rested under his coat. Rand hissed at
him, but he paid no attention. If Hake saw that ruby, he might not
wait until they were alone. If the men in the common room saw it,
half of them might join in with Hake.</p>

<p>Worst of all, Mat stared at the Whitebridge merchant&mdash;the Darkfriend?&mdash;twice as hard as at anyone else, and
Gode noticed. There was no way he could avoid noticing. But it did
not disturb his aplomb is the least. His smile deepened, if
anything, and he nodded to Mat as if to an old acquaintance, then
looked at Rand and raised a questioning eyebrow. Rand did not want
to know what the question was. He tried to avoid looking at the
man, but he knew it was too late for that. <em>Too late. Too late
again</em>.</p>

<p>Only one thing seemed to shake the velvet-cloaked
man&rsquo;s equilibrium. Rand&rsquo;s sword. He had left it on. Two or three
men staggered up to ask if he thought his playing was so bad that
he needed protection, but none of them had noticed the heron on the
hilt. Gode noticed. His pale hands clenched, and he frowned at the
sword for a long time before his smile came back. When it did, it
was not as sure as before.</p>

<p><em>One good thing, at least</em>, Rand thought.
<em>If he believes I can live up to the heron-mark, maybe he&rsquo;ll
leave us alone. Then all we have to worry about is Hake and his
bullies</em>. It was hardly a comforting thought, and, sword or no
sword, Gode kept watching. And smiling.</p>

<p>To Rand the night seemed to last a year. All those
eyes looking at him: Hake and Jak and Strom like vultures watching
a sheep caught in a bog, Gode waiting like something even worse. He
began to think that everybody in the room was watching with some
hidden motive. Sour wine fumes and the stench of dirty, sweating
bodies made his head swim, and the din of voices beat at him till
his eyes blurred and even the sound of his own flute scratched at
his ears. The crash of the thunder seemed to be inside his skull.
Weariness hung on him like an iron weight.</p>

<p>Eventually the need to be up with the dawn began to
pull men reluctantly out into the dark. A farmer had only himself
to answer to, but merchants were notoriously unfeeling about
hangovers when they were paying drivers&rsquo; wages. In the small hours
the common room slowly emptied as even those who had rooms
abovestairs staggered off to find their beds.</p>

<p>Gode was the last patron. When Rand reached for the
leather flute case, yawning, Gode stood up and slung his cloak over
his arm. The serving maids were cleaning up, muttering among
themselves about the mess of spilled wine and broken crockery. Hake
was locking the front door with a big key. Gode cornered Hake for a
moment, and Hake called one of the women to show him to a room. The
velvet-cloaked man gave Mat and Rand a knowing smile before he
disappeared upstairs.</p>

<p>Hake was looking at Rand and Mat. Jak and Strom stood
at his shoulders.</p>

<p>Rand hastily finished hanging his things from his
shoulders, holding them all awkwardly behind him with his left hand
so he could reach his sword. He made no move toward it, but he
wanted to know it was ready. He suppressed a yawn; how tired he
was, was something they should not know.</p>

<p>Mat shouldered his bow and his few other belongings
awkwardly, but he put his hand under his coat as he watched Hake
and his toughs approach.</p>

<p>Hake was carrying an oil lamp, and to Rand&rsquo;s surprise
he gave a little bow and gestured to a side door with it. &ldquo;Your
pallets are this way.&rdquo; Only a slight twist of his lips spoiled his
act.</p>

<p>Mat thrust his chin out at Jak and Strom. &ldquo;You need
those two to show us our beds?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a man of property,&rdquo; Hake said, smoothing the
front of his soiled apron, &ldquo;and men of property can&rsquo;t be too
careful.&rdquo; A crash of thunder rattled the windows, and he glanced
significantly at the ceiling, then gave them a toothy grin. &ldquo;You
want to see your beds or not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand wondered what would happen if he said they
wanted to leave. <em>If you really did know more about using a
sword than the few exercises Lan showed you</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;Lead the
way,&rdquo; he said, trying to make his voice hard. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like having
anybody behind me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Strom snickered, but Hake nodded placidly and turned
toward the side door, and the two big men swaggered after him.
Taking a deep breath, Rand gave a wishful glance at the door to the
kitchen. If Hake had already locked the back door, running now
would only begin what he was hoping to avoid. He followed the
innkeeper glumly.</p>

<p>At the side door he hesitated, and Mat crowded into
his back. The reason for Hake&rsquo;s lamp was apparent. The door let
into a hall as black as pitch. Only the lamp Hake carried,
silhouetting Jak and Strom, gave him the courage to keep on. If
they turned, he would know it. <em>And do what?</em> The floor
creaked under his boots.</p>

<p>The hall ended in a rough, unpainted door. He had not
seen if there were any other doors along the way. Hake and his
bullies went through, and he followed quickly, before they could
have a chance to set a trap, but Hake merely lifted the lamp high
and gestured at the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An old storeroom, he had called it, and by the look
of it not used in some time. Weathered barrels and broken crates
filled half the floor. Steady drips fell from more than one place
on the ceiling, and a broken pane in the filthy window let the rain
blow in freely. Unidentifiable odds and ends littered the shelves,
and thick dust covered almost everything. The presence of the
promised pallets was a surprise.</p>

<p><em>The sword makes him nervous. He won&rsquo;t try
anything until we&rsquo;re sound asleep</em>. Rand had no intention of
sleeping under Hake&rsquo;s roof. As soon as the innkeeper left, he
intended to be out the window. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; he said. He kept his
eyes on Hake, wary for a signal to the two grinning men at the
innkeeper&rsquo;s side. It was an effort not to wet his lips. &ldquo;Leave the
lamp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hake grunted, but pushed the lamp onto a shelf. He
hesitated, looking at them, and Rand was sure he was about to give
the word for Jak and Strom to jump them, but his eyes went to
Rand&rsquo;s sword with a calculating frown, and he jerked his head at
the two big men. Surprise flashed across their broad faces, but
they followed him out of the room without a backward glance.</p>

<p>Rand waited for the <em>creak-creak-creak</em> of
their footsteps to fade away, then counted to fifty before sticking
his head into the hall. The blackness was broken only by a
rectangle of light that seemed as distant as the moon: the door to
the common room. As he pulled his head in, something big moved in
the darkness near the far door. Jak or Strom, standing guard.</p>

<p>A quick examination of the door told him all he
needed to know, little of it good. The boards were thick and stout,
but there was no lock, and no bar on the inside. It did open into
the room, though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought they were going for us,&rdquo; Mat said. &ldquo;What
are they waiting for?&rdquo; He had the dagger out, gripped in a
white-knuckled fist. Lamplight flickered on the blade. His bow and
quiver lay forgotten on the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For us to go to sleep.&rdquo; Rand started rummaging
through the barrels and crates. &ldquo;Help me find something to block
the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why? You don&rsquo;t really intend to sleep here, do you?
Let&rsquo;s get out the window and gone. I&rsquo;d rather be wet than
dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of them is at the end of the hall. We make any
noise, and they&rsquo;ll be down on us before we can blink. I think Hake
would rather face us awake than risk letting us get away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Muttering, Mat joined his search, but there was
nothing useful in any of the litter on the floor. The barrels were
empty, the crates splintered, and the whole lot of them piled in
front of the door would not stop anyone from opening it. Then
something familiar on a shelf caught Rand&rsquo;s eye. Two splitting
wedges, covered with rust and dust. He took them down with a
grin.</p>

<p>Hastily he shoved them under the door and, when the
next roll of thunder rattled the inn, drove them in with two quick
kicks of his heel. The thunder faded, and he held his breath,
listening. All he heard was the rain pounding on the roof. No
floorboards creaking under running feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The window,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>It had not been opened in years, from the dirt
crusted around it. They strained together, pushing up with all
their might. Rand&rsquo;s knees wobbled before the sash budged; it
groaned with each reluctant inch. When the opening was wide enough
for them to slip through, he crouched, then stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blood and ashes!&rdquo; Mat growled. &ldquo;No wonder Hake
wasn&rsquo;t worried about us slipping out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Iron bars in an iron frame glistened wetly in the
light from the lamp. Rand pushed at them; they were as solid as a
boulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw something,&rdquo; Mat said. He pawed hurriedly
through the litter on the shelves and came back with a rusty
crowbar. He rammed the end of it under the iron frame on one side,
and Rand winced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember the noise, Mat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat grimaced and muttered under his breath, but he
waited. Rand put his hands on the crowbar and tried to find good
footing in the growing puddle of water under the window. Thunder
rolled and they heaved. With a tortured squeal of nails that made
the hairs lift on Rand&rsquo;s neck, the frame shifted&mdash;a quarter
of an inch, if that. Timing themselves to peals of thunder and
lightning cracks, they heaved on the crowbar again and again.
Nothing. A quarter of an inch. Nothing. A hairsbreadth. Nothing.
Nothing.</p>

<p>Suddenly Rand&rsquo;s feet slipped in the water, and they
crashed to the floor. The crowbar clattered against the bars like a
gong. He lay in a puddle holding his breath and listening. Silence
but for the rain.</p>

<p>Mat nursed bruised knuckles and glared at him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
never get out at this rate.&rdquo; The iron frame was pushed out from the
window not quite far enough to get two fingers under it. Dozens of
thick nails crossed the narrow opening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We just have to keep trying,&rdquo; Rand said, getting up.
But as he set the crowbar under the edge of the frame, the door
creaked as someone tried to open it. The splitting wedges held it
shut. He exchanged a worried look with Mat. Mat pulled the dagger
out again. The door gave another screak.</p>

<p>Rand took a deep breath and tried to make his voice
steady. &ldquo;Go away, Hake. We&rsquo;re trying to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear you mistake me.&rdquo; The voice was so sleek and
full of itself that it named its owner. Howal Gode. &ldquo;Master Hake
and his&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;minions will not trouble us. They sleep soundly, and
in the morning they will only be able to wonder where you vanished
to. Let me in, my young friends. We must talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have anything to talk to you about,&rdquo; Mat
said. &ldquo;Go away and let us sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gode&rsquo;s chuckle was nasty. &ldquo;Of course we have things
to talk about. You know that as well as I. I saw it in your eyes. I
know what you are, perhaps better than you do. I can feel it coming
from you in waves. Already you halfway belong to my master. Stop
running and accept it. Things will be so much easier for you. If
the Tar Valon hags find you, you&rsquo;ll wish you could cut your own
throat before they are done, but you won&rsquo;t be able to. Only my
master can protect you from them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand swallowed hard. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re
talking about. Leave us alone.&rdquo; The floorboards in the hall
squeaked. Gode was not alone. How many men could he have brought in
two carriages?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop being foolish, my young friends. You know. You
know very well. The Great Lord of the Dark has marked you for his
own. It is written that when he awakes, the new Dreadlords will be
there to praise him. You must be two of them, else I would not have
been sent to find you. Think of it. Life everlasting, and power
beyond dreams.&rdquo; His voice was thick with hunger for that power
himself.</p>

<p>Rand glanced back at the window just as lightning
split the sky, and he almost groaned. The brief flash of light
showed men outside, men ignoring the rain that drenched them as
they stood watching the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tire of this,&rdquo; Gode announced. &ldquo;You will submit to
my master&mdash;to your master&mdash;or you will be made to
submit. That would not be pleasant for you. The Great Lord of the
Dark rules death, and he can give life in death or death in life as
he chooses. Open this door. One way or another, your running is at
an end. Open it, I say!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He must have said something else, too, for suddenly a
heavy body thudded against the door. It shivered, and the wedges
slid a fraction of an inch with a grate of rust rubbing off on
wood. Again and again the door trembled as bodies hurled themselves
at it. Sometimes the wedges held; sometimes they slid another tiny
bit, and bit by tiny bit the door crept inexorably inward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Submit,&rdquo; Gode demanded from the hall, &ldquo;or spend
eternity wishing that you had!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t have any choice&mdash;&rdquo; Mat licked his
lips under Rand&rsquo;s stare. His eyes darted like the eyes of a badger
in a trap; his face was pale, and he panted as he spoke. &ldquo;We could
say yes, and then get away later. Blood and ashes, Rand, there&rsquo;s no
way out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words seemed to drift to Rand through wool
stuffed in his ears. <em>No way out</em>. Thunder muttered
overhead, and was drowned in a slash of lightning. <em>Have to find
a way out</em>. Gode called to them, demanding, appealing; the door
slid another inch toward being open. <em>A way out!</em></p>

<p>Light filled the room, flooding vision; the air
roared and burned. Rand felt himself picked up and dashed against
the wall. He slid down in a heap, ears ringing and every hair on
his body trying to stand on end. Dazed, he staggered to his feet.
His knees wobbled, and he put a hand against the wall to steady
himself. He looked around in amazement.</p>

<p>The lamp, lying on its side on the edge of one of the
few shelves still clinging to the walls, still burned and gave
light. All the barrels and crates, some blackened and smoldering,
lay toppled where they had been hurled. The window, bars and all,
and most of the wall, too, had vanished, leaving a splintered hole.
The roof sagged, and tendrils of smoke fought the rain around the
jagged edges of the opening. The door hung off its hinges, jammed
in the doorframe at an angle slanting into the hall.</p>

<p>With a feeling of woozy unreality he stood the lamp
up. It seemed the most important thing in the world was making sure
it did not break.</p>

<p>A pile of crates suddenly heaved apart, and Mat stood
up in the middle of it. He weaved on his feet, blinking and
fumbling at himself as if wondering if everything was still
attached. He peered toward Rand. &ldquo;Rand? Is that you? You&rsquo;re alive.
I thought we were both&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off, biting his lip and
shaking. It took Rand a moment to realize he was laughing, and on
the edge of hysteria.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happened, Mat? Mat? Mat! What happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>One last shiver wracked Mat, and then he was still.
&ldquo;Lightning, Rand. I was looking right at the window when it hit the
bars. Lightning. I can&rsquo;t see worth&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off, squinting
at the aslant door, and his voice went sharp. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Gode?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nothing moved in the dark corridor beyond the door.
Of Gode and his companions there was neither sign nor sound, though
anything could have lain in the blackness. Rand found himself
hoping they were dead, but he would not have put his head into the
hall to find out for sure if he had been offered a crown. Nothing
moved out in the night beyond where the wall had been, either, but
others were up and about. Confused shouts came from abovestairs in
the inn, and the pounding of running feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go while we can,&rdquo; Rand said.</p>

<p>Hastily helping separate their belongings from the
rubble, he grabbed Mat&rsquo;s arm and half pulled, half guided his
friend through the gaping hole into the night. Mat clutched his
arm, stumbling beside him with his head pushed forward in an effort
to see.</p>

<p>As the first rain hit Rand&rsquo;s face, lightning forked
above the inn, and he came to a convulsive stop. Gode&rsquo;s men were
still there, lying with their feet toward the opening. Pelted by
the rain, their open eyes stared at the sky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Mat asked. &ldquo;Blood and ashes! I can
hardly see my own bloody hand!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Rand said. <em>Luck. The Light&rsquo;s own</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Is it?</em> Shivering, he carefully guided Mat around the
bodies. &ldquo;Just the lightning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no light save the lightning, and he
stumbled in the ruts as they ran staggering away from the inn. With
Mat almost hanging on him, every stumble almost pulled them both
down, but tottering, panting, they ran.</p>

<p>Once he looked back. Once, before the rain thickened
to a deafening curtain that blotted The Dancing Cartman from sight.
Lightning silhouetted the figure of a man at the back of the inn, a
man shaking his fist at them, or at the sky. Gode or Hake, he did
not know, but either one was as bad as the other. The rain came in
a deluge, isolating them in a wall of water. He hurried through the
night, listening through the roar of the storm for the sound of
pursuit.</p>
