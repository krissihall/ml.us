the moonlight Rand could not really see what he was doing,
but Tam&rsquo;s wound seemed to be only a shallow gash along the ribs, no
longer than the palm of his hand. He shook his head in disbelief.
He had seen his father take more of an injury than that and not
even stop work except to wash it off. Hastily he searched Tam from
head to foot for something bad enough to account for the fever, but
the one cut was all he could find.</p>

<p>Small as it was, that lone cut was still grave enough; the flesh
around it burned to the touch. It was even hotter than the rest of
Tam&rsquo;s body, and the rest of him was hot enough to make Rand&rsquo;s jaws
clench. A scalding fever like that could kill, or leave a man a
husk of what he had once been. He soaked a cloth with water from
the skin and laid it across Tam&rsquo;s forehead.</p>

<p>He tried to be gentle about washing and bandaging the gash on
his father&rsquo;s ribs, but soft groans still interrupted Tam&rsquo;s low
muttering. Stark branches loomed around them, threatening as they
shifted as in the wind. Surely the Trollocs would go on their way
when they failed to find Tam and him, when they came back to the
farmhouse and found it still empty. He tried to make himself
believe it, but the wanton destruction at the house, the
senselessness of it, left little room for belief of that sort.
Believing they would give up short of killing everyone and
everything they could find was dangerous, a foolish chance he could
not afford to take.</p>

<p><em>Trollocs. Light above, Trollocs! Creatures out of a gleeman&rsquo;s
tale coming out of the night to bash in the door. And a Fade. Light
shine on me, a Fade!</em></p>

<p>Abruptly he realized he was holding the untied ends of the
bandage in motionless hands. <em>Frozen like a rabbit that&rsquo;s seen a
hawk&rsquo;s shadow</em>, he thought scornfully. With an angry shake of his
head he finished tying the bandage around Tam&rsquo;s chest.</p>

<p>Knowing what he had to do, even getting on with it, did not stop
him being afraid. When the Trollocs came back they would surely
begin searching the forest around the farm for some trace of the
people who had escaped them. The body of the one he had killed
would tell them those people were not far off. Who knew what a Fade
would do, or could do? On top of that, his father&rsquo;s comment about
Trollocs&rsquo; hearing was as loud in his mind as if Tam had just said
it. He found himself resisting the urge to put a hand over Tam&rsquo;s
mouth, to still his groans and murmurs. <em>Some track by scent. What
can I do about that? Nothing</em>. He could not waste time worrying over
problems he could do nothing about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have to keep quiet,&rdquo; he whispered in his father&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;The
Trollocs will be back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tam spoke in hushed, hoarse tones. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re still lovely, Kari.
Still lovely as a girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand grimaced. His mother had been dead fifteen years. If Tam
believed she was still alive, then the fever was even worse than
Rand had thought. How could he be kept from speaking, now that
silence might mean life?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother wants you to be quiet,&rdquo; Rand whispered. He paused to
clear his throat of a sudden tightness. She had had gentle hands;
he remembered that much. &ldquo;Kari wants you to be quiet. Here.
Drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tam gulped thirstily from the waterskin, but after a few
swallows he turned his head aside and began murmuring softly again,
too low for Rand to understand. He hoped it was too low to be heard
by hunting Trollocs, too.</p>

<p>Hastily he got on with what was needed. Three of the blankets he
wove around and between the shafts cut from the cart, contriving a
makeshift litter. He would only be able to carry one end, letting
the other drag on the ground, but it would have to do. From the
last blanket he cut a long strip with his belt knife, then tied one
end of the strip to each of the shafts.</p>

<p>As gently as he could, he lifted Tam onto the litter, wincing
with every moan. His father had always seemed indestructible.
Nothing could harm him; nothing could stop him, or even slow him
down. For him to be in this condition almost robbed Rand of what
courage he had managed to gather. But he had to keep on. That was
all that kept him moving. He had to.</p>

<p>When Tam finally lay on the litter, Rand hesitated, then took
the sword belt from his father&rsquo;s waist. When he fastened it around
himself, it felt odd there; it made him feel odd. Belt and sheath
and sword together only weighed a few pounds, but when he sheathed
the blade it seemed to drag at him like a great weight.</p>

<p>Angrily he berated himself. This was no time or place for
foolish fancies. It was only a big knife. How many times had he
daydreamed about wearing a sword and having adventures? If he could
kill one Trolloc with it, he could surely fight off any others as
well. Only, he knew all too well that what had happened in the
farmhouse had been the purest luck. And his daydream adventures had
never included his teeth chattering, or running for his life
through the night, or his father at the point of death.</p>

<p>Hastily he tucked the last blanket around Tam, and laid the
waterskin and the rest of the cloths beside his father on the
litter. With a deep breath he knelt between the shafts and lifted
the strip of blanket over his head. It settled across his shoulders
and under his arms. When he gripped the shafts and straightened,
most of the weight was on his shoulders. It did not seem like very
much. Trying to keep a smooth pace, he set out for Emond&rsquo;s Field,
the litter scraping along behind him.</p>

<p>He had already decided to make his way to the Quarry Road and
follow that to the village. The danger would almost certainly be
greater along the road, but Tam would receive no help at all if he
got them lost trying to find his way through the woods and the
dark.</p>

<p>In the darkness he was almost out onto the Quarry Road before he
knew it. When he realized where he was, his throat tightened like a
fist. Hurriedly he turned the litter around and dragged it back
into the trees a way, then stopped to catch his breath and let his
heart stop pounding. Still panting, he turned east, toward Emond&rsquo;s
Field.</p>

<p>Traveling through the trees was more difficult than taking Tam
down the road, and the night surely did not help, but going out
onto the road itself would be madness. The idea was to reach the
village <em>without</em> meeting any Trollocs; without even seeing any, if
he had his wish. He had to assume the Trollocs were still hunting
them, and sooner or later they would realize the two had set off
for the village. That was the most likely place to go, and the
Quarry Road the most likely route. In truth, he found himself
closer to the road than he liked. The night and the shadows under
the trees seemed awfully bare cover in which to hide from the eyes
of anyone traveling along it.</p>

<p>Moonlight filtering through bare branches gave only enough
illumination to fool his eyes into thinking they saw what was
underfoot. Roots threatened to trip him at every step, old brambles
snagged his legs, and sudden dips or rises in the ground had him
half falling as his foot met nothing but air where he expected firm
earth, or stumbling when his toe struck dirt while still moving
forward. Tam&rsquo;s mutterings broke into a sharp groan whenever one of
the shafts bumped too quickly over root or rock.</p>

<p>Uncertainty made him peer into the darkness until his eyes
burned, listen as he had never listened before. Every scrape of
branch against branch, every rustle of pine needles, brought him to
a halt, ears straining, hardly daring to breathe for fear he might
not hear some warning sound, for fear he might hear that sound.
Only when he was sure it was just the wind would he go on.</p>

<p>Slowly weariness crept into his arms and legs, driven home by a
night wind that mocked his cloak and coat. The weight of the
litter, so little at the start, now tried to pull him to the
ground. His stumbles were no longer all from tripping. The almost
constant struggle not to fall took as much out of him as did the
actual work of pulling the litter. He had been up before dawn to
begin his chores, and even with the trip to Emond&rsquo;s Field he had
done almost a full day&rsquo;s work. On any normal night he would be
resting before the fireplace, reading one of Tam&rsquo;s small collection
of books before going to bed. The sharp chill soaked into his
bones, and his stomach reminded him that he had had nothing to eat
since Mistress al&rsquo;Vere&rsquo;s honeycakes.</p>

<p>He muttered to himself, angry at not taking some food at the
farm. A few minutes more could not have made any difference. A few
minutes to find some bread and cheese. The Trollocs would not have
come back in just a few minutes more. Or just the bread. Of course,
Mistress al&rsquo;Vere would insist on putting a hot meal in front of him
once they reached the inn. A steaming plate of her thick lamb stew,
probably. And some of that bread she had been baking. And lots of
hot tea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They came over the Dragonwall like a flood,&rdquo; Tam said suddenly,
in a strong, angry voice, &ldquo;and washed the land with blood. How many
died for Laman&rsquo;s sin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand almost fell from surprise. Wearily he lowered the litter to
the ground and untangled himself. The strip of blanket left a
burning groove in his shoulders. Shrugging to work the knots out,
he knelt beside Tam. Fumbling for the waterbag, he peered through
the trees, trying vainly in the dim moonlight to see up and down
the road, not twenty paces away. Nothing moved there but shadows.
Nothing but shadows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any flood of Trollocs, father. Not now, anyway.
We&rsquo;ll be safe in Emond&rsquo;s Field soon. Drink a little water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tam brushed aside the waterbag with an arm that seemed to have
regained all of its strength. He seized Rand&rsquo;s collar, pulling him
close enough to feel the heat of his father&rsquo;s fever in his own
cheek. &ldquo;They called them savages,&rdquo; Tam said urgently. &ldquo;The fools
said they could be swept aside like rubbish. How many battles lost,
how many cities burned, before they faced the truth? Before the
nations stood together against them?&rdquo; He loosed his hold on Rand,
and sadness filled his voice. &ldquo;The field at Marath carpeted with
the dead, and no sound but the cries of ravens and the buzzing of
files. The topless towers of Cairhien burning in the night like
torches. All the way to the Shining Walls they burned and slew
before they were turned back. All the way to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand clamped a hand over his father&rsquo;s mouth. The sound came
again, a rhythmic thudding, directionless in the trees, fading then
growing stronger again as the wind shifted. Frowning, he turned his
head slowly, trying to decide from where it came. A flicker of
motion caught the corner of his eye, and in an instant he was
crouched over Tam. He was startled to feel the hilt of the sword
clutched tight in his hand, but most of him concentrated on the
Quarry Road as if the road were the only real thing in the entire
world.</p>

<p>Wavering shadows to the east slowly resolved themselves into a
horse and rider followed up the road by tall, bulky shapes trotting
to keep up with the animal. The pale light of the moon glittered
from spearheads and axe blades. Rand never even considered that
they might be villagers coming to help. He knew what they were. He
could feel it, like grit scraping his bones, even before they drew
close enough for moonlight to reveal the hooded cloak swathing the
horseman, a cloak that hung undisturbed by the wind. All of the
shapes appeared black in the night, and the horse&rsquo;s hooves made the
same sounds that any other&rsquo;s would, but Rand knew this horse from
any other.</p>

<p>Behind the dark rider came nightmare forms with horns and
muzzles and beaks, Trollocs in a double file, all in step, boots
and hooves striking the ground at the same instant as if obeying a
single mind. Rand counted twenty as they ran past. He wondered what
kind of man would dare turn his back on so many Trollocs. Or on
one, for that matter.</p>

<p>The trotting column disappeared westward, thumping footfalls
fading into the darkness, but Rand remained where he was, not
moving a muscle except to breathe. Something told him to be
certain, absolutely certain, they were gone before he moved. At
long last he drew a deep breath and began to straighten.</p>

<p>This time the horse made no sound at all. In eerie silence the
dark rider returned, his shadowy mount stopping every few steps as
it walked slowly back down the road. The wind gusted higher, moaning
through the trees; the horseman&rsquo;s cloak lay still as death.
Whenever the horse halted, that hooded head swung from side to side
as the rider peered into the forest, searching. Exactly opposite
Rand the horse stopped again, the shadowed opening of the hood
turning toward where he crouched above his father.</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s hand tightened convulsively on the sword hilt. He felt
the gaze, just as he had that morning, and shivered again from the
hatred even if he could not see it. That shrouded man hated
everyone and everything, everything that lived. Despite the cold
wind, sweat beaded on Rand&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>Then the horse was moving on, a few soundless steps and stop,
until all Rand could see was a barely distinguishable blur in the
night far down the road. It could have been anything, but he had
not taken his eyes off it for a second. If he lost it, he was
afraid the next time he saw the black-cloaked rider might be when
that silent horse was on top of him.</p>

<p>Abruptly the shadow was rushing back, passing him in a silent
gallop. The rider looked only ahead of him as he sped westward into
the night, toward the Mountains of Mist. Toward the farm.</p>

<p>Rand sagged, gulping air and scrubbing cold sweat off his face
with his sleeve. He did not care any more about why the Trollocs
had come. If he never found out why, that would be fine, just as
long as it was all ended.</p>

<p>With a shake he gathered himself, hastily
checking his father. Tam was still murmuring, but so softly Rand
could not make out the words. He tried to give him a drink, but the
water spilled over his father&rsquo;s chin. Tam coughed and choked on the
trickle that made it into his mouth, then began muttering again as
if there had not been any interruption.</p>

<p>Rand splashed a little more water on the cloth on Tam&rsquo;s
forehead, pushed the waterbag back on the litter, and scrambled
between the shafts again.</p>

<p>He started out as if he had had a good night&rsquo;s sleep, but the
new strength did not last long. Fear masked his tiredness in the
beginning, but though the fear remained, the mask melted away
quickly. Soon he was back to stumbling forward, trying to ignore
hunger and aching muscles. He concentrated on putting one foot in
front of the other without tripping.</p>

<p>In his mind he pictured Emond&rsquo;s Field, shutters thrown back and
the houses lit for Winternight, people shouting greetings as they
passed back and forth on their visits, fiddles filling the streets
with &ldquo;Jaem&rsquo;s Folly&rdquo; and &ldquo;Heron on the Wing.&rdquo; Haral Luhhan would
have one too many brandies and start singing &ldquo;The Wind in the
Barley&rdquo; in a voice like a bullfrog&mdash;he always did&mdash;until his wife managed to shush him, and Cenn Buie would decide to
prove he could still dance as well as ever, and Mat would have
something planned that would not quite happen the way he intended,
and everybody would know he was responsible even if no one could
prove it. He could almost smile thinking about now it would be.</p>

<p>After a time Tam spoke up again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Avendesora</em>. It&rsquo;s said it makes no seed, but they brought a
cutting to Cairhien, a sapling. A royal gift of wonder for the
King.&rdquo; Though he sounded angry, he was barely loud enough for Rand
to understand. Anyone who could hear him would be able to hear the
litter scraping across the ground, too. Rand kept on, only half
listening. &ldquo;They never make peace. Never. But they brought a
sapling, as a sign of peace. A hundred years it grew. A hundred
years of peace with those who make no peace with strangers. Why did
he cut it down? Why? Blood was the price for <em>Avendoraldera</em>. Blood
the price for Laman&rsquo;s pride.&rdquo; He faded off into muttering once
more.</p>

<p>Tiredly Rand wondered what fever-dream Tam could be having now.
<em>Avendesora</em>. The Tree of Life was supposed to have all sorts of
miraculous qualities, but none of the stories mentioned any
sapling, or any &ldquo;they.&rdquo; There was only the one, and that belonged
to the Green Man.</p>

<p>Only that morning he might have felt foolish at musing over the
Green Man and the Tree of Life. They were only stories. <em>Are they?
Trollocs were just stories this morning</em>. Maybe all the stories were
as real as the news the peddlers and merchants brought, all the
gleeman&rsquo;s tales and all the stories told at night in front of the
fireplace. Next he might actually meet the Green Man, or an Ogier
giant, or a wild, black-veiled Aielman.</p>

<p>Tam was talking again, he realized, sometimes only murmuring,
sometimes loud enough to understand. From time to time he stopped
to pant for breath, then went on as if he thought he had been
speaking the whole time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;battles are always hot, even in the snow. Sweat heat.
Blood heat. Only death is cool. Slope of the mountain&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;only
place didn&rsquo;t stink of death. Had to get away from smell of it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;sight of it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;heard a baby cry. Their women fight alongside the
men, sometimes, but why they had let her come, I don&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;gave
birth there alone, before she died of her wounds&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;covered the
child with her cloak, but the wind&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;blown the cloak away&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;child, blue with the cold. Should have been dead, too&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;crying
there. Crying in the snow. I couldn&rsquo;t just leave a child&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;no
children of our own&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;always knew you wanted children. I knew
you&rsquo;d take it to your heart, Kari. Yes, lass. Rand is a good name.
A good name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly Rand&rsquo;s legs lost the little strength they had.
Stumbling, he fell to his knees. Tam moaned with the jolt, and the
strip of blanket cut into Rand&rsquo;s shoulders, but he was not aware of
either. If a Trolloc had leaped up in front of him right then, he
would just have stared at it. He looked over his shoulder at Tam,
who had sunk back into wordless murmur. <em>Fever-dreams</em>, he thought
dully. Fevers always brought bad dreams, and this was a night for
nightmares even without a fever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are my father,&rdquo; he said aloud, stretching back a hand to
touch Tam, &ldquo;and I am&mdash;&rdquo; The fever was worse. Much worse.</p>

<p>Grimly he struggled to his feet. Tam murmured something, but
Rand refused to listen to any more. Throwing his weight against the
improvised harness he tried to put all of his mind into taking one
leaden step after another, into reaching the safety of Emond&rsquo;s
Field. But he could not stop the echo in the back of his mind. <em>He&rsquo;s
my father. It was just a fever-dream. He&rsquo;s my father. It was just a
fever-dream. Light, who am I?</em></p>
