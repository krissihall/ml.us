<h4><em>A Crown of Swords</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>ossing,
Rand dreamed, wild dreams where he argued
with Perrin and begged Mat to find Elayne, where colors flashed
just beyond sight and Padan Fain leaped at him with a flashing
blade, and sometimes he thought he heard a voice moaning for a dead
woman in the heart of a fog, dreams where he tried to explain
himself to Elayne, to Aviendha, to Min, to all three at once, and
even Min looked at him with scorn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;not to be disturbed!&rdquo; Cadsuane&rsquo;s voice.
Part of his dreams?</p>

<p>The voice frightened him; in his dream he shouted for
Lews Therin, and the sound echoed through a thick mist where shapes
moved and people and horses died screaming, a fog where Cadsuane
followed him implacably while he ran, panting. Alanna tried to
soothe him, but she was afraid of Cadsuane, too; he could feel her
fear as strongly as his own. His head hurt. And his side; the old
scar was fire. He felt <em>saidin</em>. Someone held
<em>saidin</em>. Was it him? He did not know. He struggled to
wake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll kill him!&rdquo; Min shouted. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t
let you kill him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His eyes opened, staring up at her face. Not looking
at him, she had his head wrapped in her arms and was glaring at
someone away from the bed. Her eyes were red. She had been crying,
but no longer. Yes, he was in his own bed, in his rooms in the Sun
Palace. He could see a heavy square blackwood bedpost set with
wedges of ivory. Coatless in a cream silk blouse, Min lay curled
around him protectively, atop the linen sheet that covered him to
the neck. Alanna was afraid; that lay shivering in the back of his
head. Afraid for him. For some reason, he was sure of that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think he is awake, Min,&rdquo; Amys said gently.</p>

<p>Min looked down, and her face, framed in dark
ringlets, beamed with a sudden smile.</p>

<p>Carefully&mdash;because he felt weak&mdash;he
removed her arms and sat up. His head whirled dizzily, but he
forced himself not to lie back again. His bed was ringed.</p>

<p>To one side stood Amys, flanked by Bera and Kiruna.
Amys&rsquo; too-youthful features bore no expression at all, but she
brushed back her long white hair and shifted her dark shawl as
though tidying herself after a struggle. Outwardly the two Aes
Sedai were serene, yet with determined serenity, a queen ready to
fight for her throne, a country woman ready to fight for her farm.
Oddly, if he had ever seen three people stand together&mdash;and
not just physically&mdash;it was those three, shoulder-to-shoulder
as one.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the bed, Samitsu, with those
silver bells in her hair, and a slender sister with thick black
eyebrows and a wild look to her raven hair stood with Cadsuane, who
had her fists planted on her hips. Samitsu and the raven-haired Aes
Sedai wore yellow-fringed shawls and had jaws set every bit as
firmly as Bera or Kiruna, yet Cadsuane&rsquo;s stern stare made all
four appear hesitant. The two groups of women were not staring at
one another, but at the men.</p>

<p>At the foot of the bed were Dashiva with the silver
sword and red-and-gold Dragon glittering his collar, and Flinn and
Narishma, all grim-faced, trying to watch the women on both sides
of the bed at once. Jonan Adley stood beside them, his black coat
looking singed on one sleeve. <em>Saidin</em> filled all four men,
to overflowing it seemed. Dashiva held almost as much as Rand could
have. Rand looked to Adley, who nodded slightly.</p>

<p>Abruptly, Rand realized that he was not wearing
anything beneath the sheet that had fallen to his waist, and
nothing above except a bandage wound around his middle. &ldquo;How long
have I been asleep?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;How is it I&rsquo;m alive?&rdquo; He
touched the pale bandage gingerly. &ldquo;Fain&rsquo;s dagger came from
Shadar Logoth. Once I saw it kill a man in moments with a scratch.
He died fast, and he died hard.&rdquo; Dashiva muttered a curse with
Padan Fain&rsquo;s name in it.</p>

<p>Samitsu and the other Yellow exchanged startled
looks, but Cadsuane merely nodded, the golden ornaments around her
iron-gray bun swaying. &ldquo;Yes; Shadar Logoth; that would explain
several matters. You can thank Samitsu that you&rsquo;re alive, and
Master Flinn.&rdquo; She did not glance toward the grizzled man with his
fringe of white hair, but he grinned as though she had given him a
bow; in truth, surprisingly, the Yellows did nod to him. &ldquo;And
Corele, here, of course,&rdquo; Cadsuane went on. &ldquo;Each has done a part,
including some things I think have not been done since the
Breaking.&rdquo; Her voice turned grim. &ldquo;Without all three, you would be
dead by now. You still may die unless you let yourself be guided.
You must rest, without exertion.&rdquo; His stomach rumbled suddenly,
loudly, and she added, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve only been able to get a little
water and broth down you since you were hurt. Two days is a long
time without food for a sick man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two days. Only two. He avoided looking at Adley. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting up,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let them kill you, sheepherder,&rdquo; Min
said with an obstinate glint in her eyes, &ldquo;and I won&rsquo;t let you
kill you, either.&rdquo; She put her arms around his shoulders as if to
hold him where he was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> wishes to
rise,&rdquo; Amys said flatly, &ldquo;I will have Nandera bring in the Maidens
from the corridor. Somara and Enaila will be especially happy to
give him just the assistance he needs.&rdquo; The corners of her mouth
twitched toward a smile. Once a Maiden herself, she knew close
enough to everything of that situation. Neither Kiruna nor Bera
smiled; they frowned at him as at an absolute fool.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boy,&rdquo; Cadsuane said dryly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already seen
more of your hairless bottomcheeks than I wish to, but if you want
to flaunt them in front of all six of us, perhaps someone will
enjoy the show. If you fall on your face, though, I may just spank
you before I put you back to bed.&rdquo; By Samitsu&rsquo;s face, and
Corele&rsquo;s, they would be happy to assist her.</p>

<p>Narishma and Adley stared at Cadsuane in shock, while
Flinn tugged at his coat as though arguing with himself. Dashiva,
though, barked a rough laugh. &ldquo;If you want us to clear the women
out&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; The plain-faced man began preparing flows; not shields,
but complex weaves of Spirit and Fire that Rand suspected would put
anyone they were laid on in too much pain to think of
channeling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said quickly. Bera and Kiruna would obey a
simple order to go, and if Corele and Samitsu had helped keep him
alive, he owed them more than pain. But if Cadsuane thought
nakedness would hold him where he was, she was in for a surprise.
He was not sure the Maidens had left him any modesty at all. With a
smile for Min, he unwound her arms, tossed back the sheet, and
climbed out of the bed on Amys&rsquo; side.</p>

<p>The Wise One&rsquo;s mouth tightened; he could almost
see her considering whether to call for the Maidens. Bera gave Amys
an agonized, uncertain look, while Kiruna hurriedly turned her
back, her cheeks darkening. Slowly he walked to the wardrobe.
Slowly because he expected he might give Cadsuane her chance if he
tried to move quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Phaw!&rdquo; she muttered behind him. &ldquo;I vow, I
<em>should</em> smack the stubborn boy&rsquo;s bottom.&rdquo; Someone
grunted what might have been agreement, or just disapproval of what
he was doing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but it&rsquo;s such a pretty bottom, now
isn&rsquo;t it that?&rdquo; someone else said in a lilting Murandian
accent. That must have been Corele.</p>

<p>A good thing he had his head inside the wardrobe.
Maybe the Maidens had not peeled away as much modesty as he
thought. Light! His face felt hot as a furnace. Hoping the motions
of dressing would cover any wobbles, he climbed into his clothes
hurriedly. His sword stood propped in the back of the wardrobe,
sword belt wound around the dark boarhide scabbard. He touched the
long hilt, then took his hand away.</p>

<p>Barefoot, he turned back to the others while still
tying the laces of his shirt. Min still sat cross-legged on the bed
in her snug green silk breeches, by her expression unable to decide
between approval and frustration. &ldquo;I need to talk with Dashiva and
the other Asha&rsquo;man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min scrambled off the bed and ran to hug him. Not
tightly; she was very careful of his bandaged side. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
waited too long to see you awake again,&rdquo; she said, sliding an arm
around his waist. &ldquo;I need to be with you.&rdquo; She emphasized that just
a tad; she must have had a viewing. Or maybe she just wanted to
help steady his legs; that arm seemed to offer support. Either way,
he nodded; he was not all that steady. Laying a hand on her
shoulder, he suddenly realized that he did not want the
Asha&rsquo;man to know how weak he was any more than Cadsuane or
Amys.</p>

<p>Bera and Kiruna made reluctant curtsies and started
for the door, then hesitated when Amys did not move right away. &ldquo;So
long as you do not intend to leave these rooms,&rdquo; the Wise One said,
not in the slightest as though speaking to her
<em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>.</p>

<p>Rand raised a naked foot. &ldquo;Do I look as though
I&rsquo;m going anywhere?&rdquo; Amys sniffed, but with a glance at Adley,
she gathered up Bera and Kiruna and departed.</p>

<p>Cadsuane and the other two were only a moment more in
going. The gray-haired Green glanced at Adley, too. It could not be
much of secret that he had been gone from Cairhien for days. At the
door, she paused. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do anything foolish, boy.&rdquo; She
sounded like a stern aunt cautioning a shiftless nephew, without
much expectation he would listen. Samitsu and Corele followed her
out, dividing their frowns between him and the Asha&rsquo;man. As
they vanished, Dashiva laughed, a sharp wheeze, shaking his head;
he actually sounded amused.</p>

<p>Rand stepped away from Min to fetch his boots from
beside the wardrobe and take a rolled pair of stockings from
inside. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll join you in the anteroom as soon as I&rsquo;m
booted, Dashiva.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The plain-faced Asha&rsquo;man gave a start. He had
been frowning at Adley. &ldquo;As you command, my Lord Dragon,&rdquo; he said,
pressing fist to heart.</p>

<p>Waiting until the four men were gone, Rand sat down
in a chair with a feeling of relief and began pulling on his
stockings. He was sure his legs felt stronger just for being up and
moving. Stronger, but they still did not want to support him very
well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure this is wise?&rdquo; Min said, kneeling
beside his chair, and he gave her a startled look. If he had talked
in his sleep during those two days, the Aes Sedai would have known.
Amys would have had Enaila and Somara and fifty more Maidens
waiting when he woke.</p>

<p>He tugged the stocking the rest of the way up. &ldquo;Do
you have a viewing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min sat back on her heels, folded her arms beneath
her breasts and gave him a firm look. After a moment, she decided
it was not working and sighed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Cadsuane. She is going to
teach you something, you and the Asha&rsquo;man. All the
Asha&rsquo;man, I mean. It&rsquo;s something you have to learn, but I
don&rsquo;t know what it is, except that none of you will like
learning it from her. You aren&rsquo;t going to like it at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand paused with a boot in hand, then stuffed his
foot in. What could Cadsuane, or any Aes Sedai, teach the
Asha&rsquo;man? Women could not teach men, or men women; that was as
hard a fact as the One Power itself. &ldquo;We will see&rdquo; was all he
said.</p>

<p>Plainly that did not satisfy Min. She knew it would
happen, and so did he; she was never wrong. But what <em>could</em>
Cadsuane possibly teach him? What would he let her teach him? The
woman made him unsure of himself, uneasy in a way he had not felt
since before the Stone of Tear fell.</p>

<p>Stamping his foot to settle it in the second boot, he
fetched his sword belt from the wardrobe, and a red coat worked in
gold, the same he had worn to the Sea Folk. &ldquo;What bargain did
Merana make for me?&rdquo; he asked, and she made an exasperated sound in
her throat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None, as of this morning,&rdquo; she said impatiently. &ldquo;She and Rafela haven&rsquo;t left the ship since we did, but
they&rsquo;ve sent half a dozen messages asking if you&rsquo;re well
enough to return. I don&rsquo;t think the bargaining has gone well
for them without you. I suppose it&rsquo;s too much to hope
that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; he told her. Min said nothing, but she
said it very loudly, fists on her hips and one eyebrow raised high.
Well, she would know most of it soon enough.</p>

<p>In the anteroom, all the Asha&rsquo;man except Dashiva
sprang out of their chairs when Rand appeared with Min. Staring at
nothing and talking to himself, Dashiva did not notice until Rand
reached the Rising Sun set in the floor, and then he blinked
several times before rising.</p>

<p>Rand addressed himself to Adley while fastening the
Dragon-shaped buckle of his sword belt. &ldquo;The army&rsquo;s reached
the hillforts in Illian already?&rdquo; He wanted to take one of the
gilded armchairs, but would not let himself. &ldquo;How? It should have
been several more days at the best. At best.&rdquo; Flinn and Narishma
looked as startled as Dashiva; none of them had known where Adley
and Hopwil had gone&mdash;or Morr. Deciding who to trust was
always the difficulty, and trust a razor&rsquo;s edge.</p>

<p>Adley drew himself up. There was something about his
eyes, beneath those thick eyebrows. He had seen the wolf, as they
said in Cairhien. &ldquo;The High Lord Weiramon left the foot behind and
pressed forward with the horse,&rdquo; he said, reporting stiffly. &ldquo;The
Aiel kept up, of course.&rdquo; He frowned. &ldquo;We encountered Aiel
yesterday. Shaido; I don&rsquo;t know how they got there. There were
maybe nine or ten thousand, altogether, but they didn&rsquo;t seem
to have any Wise Ones who could channel with them, and they
didn&rsquo;t really slow us down. We reached the hillforts at noon
today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand wanted to snarl. Leaving the foot behind! Did
Weiramon think he was going to take palisaded forts on hilltops
with horsemen? Probably. The man probably would have left the Aiel
behind too, if he could have outrun them. Fool nobles and their
fool honor! Still, it did not matter. Except to the men who died
because the High Lord Weiramon was contemptuous of anyone who did
not fight from horseback.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eben and I began destroying the first palisades soon
as we arrived,&rdquo; Adley went on. &ldquo;Weiramon didn&rsquo;t much like
that; I think he would have stopped us, but he was afraid to.
Anyway, we began setting fire to the logs and blowing holes in the
walls, but before we more than started, Sammael came. A man
channeling <em>saidin</em>, at least, and a lot stronger than Eben
or me. As strong as you, my Lord Dragon, I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was there right away?&rdquo; Rand said incredulously,
but then he understood. He had been sure Sammael would stay safe in
Illian behind defenses woven of the Power if he thought he had to
face Rand; too many of the Forsaken had tried, and most were dead
now. In spite of himself, Rand laughed&mdash;and had to hug his
side; laughing hurt. All that elaborate deception to convince
Sammael he would be anywhere but with the invading army, to bring
the man out of Illian, and all made unnecessary by a knife in Padan
Fain&rsquo;s hand. Two days. By this time, everybody who had
eyes-and-ears in Cairhien&mdash;which certainly included the
Forsaken&mdash;knew that the Dragon Reborn lay on the edge of
death. As well toss wet wood on the fire as think otherwise. &ldquo;Men
scheme and women plot, but the Wheel weaves as it will&rdquo;; that was
how they said it in Tear. &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Morr was with you last
night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my Lord Dragon; Fedwin comes every night, just
like he&rsquo;s supposed to. Last night, it was plain as Eben&rsquo;s
nose we&rsquo;d reach the forts today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand any of this.&rdquo; Dashiva
sounded upset; a muscle in his cheek was twitching. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
lured him out, but to what purpose? As soon as he feels a man
channel with anything near your strength, he&rsquo;ll flee back to
Illian and whatever traps and alarms he has woven. You won&rsquo;t
get at him there; he will know as soon as a gateway opens within a
mile of the city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can save the army,&rdquo; Adley burst out, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
what we can do. Weiramon was still sending charges against that
fort when I left, and Sammael cuts every one to rags despite
anything Eben or I can do.&rdquo; He shifted the arm with the singed
sleeve. &ldquo;We have to strike back and run immediately, and even so,
he nearly burned us where we stood, more than once. The Aiel are
taking casualties too. They&rsquo;re only fighting the Illianers who
come out&mdash;the other hillforts must be emptying, so many were
coming when I left&mdash;but any time Sammael sees fifty of us
together, Aiel or anybody, he rips them apart. If there were three
of him, or even two, I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d find anybody alive
when I go back.&rdquo; Dashiva stared at him as if at a madman, and Adley
shrugged suddenly, as though feeling the lightness of his bare
black collar compared with the sword and Dragon on the older
man&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Forgive me, Asha&rsquo;man,&rdquo; he muttered, abashed, then
added in a still lower voice, &ldquo;But we can at least save them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; Rand assured him. Just not the way Adley
expected. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all going to help me kill Sammael today.&rdquo;
Only Dashiva looked startled; the other men just nodded. Not even
the Forsaken frightened them anymore.</p>

<p>Rand expected argument out of Min, maybe a demand to
come along, but she surprised him. &ldquo;I expect you would as soon no
one found out you&rsquo;re gone before they have to, sheepherder.&rdquo;
He nodded and she sighed. Perhaps the Forsaken had to depend on
pigeons and eyes-and-ears just like anyone else, but being too sure
could be fatal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Maidens will want to come if they know, Min.&rdquo;
They would want to, and he would be hard-pressed to refuse. If he
could refuse. Yet the disappearance even of Nandera and whoever she
had on guard might be too much.</p>

<p>Min sighed again. &ldquo;I suppose I could go talk to
Nandera. I might be able to keep them out in the hallway for an
hour, but they won&rsquo;t be pleased with me when they find out.&rdquo;
He almost laughed again before he remembered his side; they
definitely would not be pleased with her, or with him. &ldquo;More to the
point, farmboy, Amys won&rsquo;t be pleased. Or Sorilea. The things
I let you get me into.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He opened his mouth to tell her he had not asked her
to do anything, yet before he could utter a word, she moved very
close. Looking up at him through long lashes, she put a hand on his
chest, tapping her fingers. She smiled warmly and kept her voice
soft, but the fingers were a giveaway. &ldquo;If you let anything happen
to you, Rand al&rsquo;Thor, I&rsquo;ll give Cadsuane a hand whether
she needs one or not.&rdquo; Her smile brightened for a moment, almost
cheerily, before she turned for the doors. He watched her go; she
might make his head spin sometimes&mdash;nearly every woman he had
ever met had done that at least a time or two&mdash;but she did
have a way of walking that made him want to watch.</p>

<p>Abruptly he realized Dashiva was watching as well.
And licking his lips. Rand cleared his throat loudly enough to be
heard over the sound of the door closing behind her. For some
reason, the plain-faced man raised his hands defensively. It was
not as though Rand glared at him; he could not go around glaring at
men just because Min wore tight breeches. Surrounding himself with
the emptiness of the Void, he seized <em>saidin</em> and forced
frozen fire and molten filth into the weaves for a gateway. Dashiva
leaped back as it opened. Maybe having a hand sliced off would
teach the man not to lick his lips like a goat. Something crooked
and red spiderwebbed across the outside of the Void.</p>

<p>He stepped through onto bare dirt, with Dashiva and
the others right behind, releasing the Source as soon as the last
stepped clear. A sense of loss rushed in as <em>saidin</em> left,
as awareness of Alanna dwindled. The loss had not seemed so great
while Lews Therin was there; not so huge.</p>

<p>Overhead, the golden sun was more than halfway down
to the horizon. A gust of wind swept dust from under his boots
without leaving any coolness behind. The gateway had opened in a
cleared area, marked off by a rope strung between four wooden
posts. At each corner stood a pair of guards in short coats and
baggy trousers stuffed into their boots, swords that appeared
slightly serpentine hanging at their sides. Some had heavy
mustaches that hung to their chins or thick beards, and all had
bold noses and dark eyes that seemed tilted. As soon as Rand
appeared, one of them went running.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are we doing here?&rdquo; Dashiva said, looking about
incredulously.</p>

<p>Around them stretched hundreds of sharp-peaked tents,
gray and dusty white, tents and picket lines of already saddled
horses. Caemlyn lay not many miles away, hidden behind the trees,
and the Black Tower not much farther, but Taim would not know of
this unless he had a spy watching. One of Fedwin Morr&rsquo;s tasks
had been to listen&mdash;to feel&mdash;for anyone trying to spy.
In a ripple of murmurs spreading outward from the ropes, men with
bold noses and serpentine swords rose from their heels and turned
to stare expectantly toward Rand. Here and there women stood as
well; Saldaean women often rode to the wars with their husbands, at
least among the nobles and officers. There would be none of that
today, though.</p>

<p>Ducking under the rope, Rand strode directly to a
tent no different from any other except for the banner on the staff
in front, three simple red blossoms on a field of blue. The
kingspenny did not die back even in Saldaean winters, and when
fires blackened the forests, those red flowers were always the
first to reappear. A blossom nothing could kill: the sign of House
Bashere.</p>

<p>Inside the tent, Bashere himself was already booted
and spurred, and his sword on his hip. Ominously, Deira was with
him, in a riding dress the same shade as her husband&rsquo;s gray
coat, and if she wore no sword, the long dagger at her belt of
heavy silver roundels would do to go on with. The leather gauntlets
tucked behind that belt spoke of someone meaning to ride hard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t expected this for days yet,&rdquo; Bashere
said, rising from a folding camp chair. &ldquo;Weeks, I hoped, in truth.
I had hoped to have most of Taim&rsquo;s leavings armed the way
young Mat and I planned&mdash;I&rsquo;ve gathered every maker of
crossbows I could find into a manufactory, and they&rsquo;re
starting to produce them like a sow dropping piglets&mdash;but as
it is, no more than fifteen thousand have crossbows and know what
to do with them.&rdquo; With a questioning look, he lifted a silver
pitcher from atop the maps spread out on his folding table. &ldquo;Do we
have time for punch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No punch,&rdquo; Rand said impatiently. Bashere had spoken
before about the men Taim found who could not learn to channel, but
he had scarcely listened. If Bashere thought he had trained them
well enough, that was all that mattered. &ldquo;Dashiva and three more
Asha&rsquo;man are waiting outside; as soon as Morr joins them,
we&rsquo;ll be ready.&rdquo; He eyed Deira ni Ghaline t&rsquo;Bashere,
towering over her diminutive husband with her hawk&rsquo;s beak of a
nose and her eyes that made a hawk&rsquo;s look mild. &ldquo;No punch,
Lord Bashere. And no wives. Not today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Deira opened her mouth, her dark eyes all but glowing
suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No wives,&rdquo; Bashere said, knuckling his heavy
gray-streaked mustaches. &ldquo;I will pass the order.&rdquo; Turning to Deira,
he held out his hand. &ldquo;Wife,&rdquo; he said mildly. Rand winced, mild
tone or no, and waited for the eruption.</p>

<p>Deira&rsquo;s mouth thinned. She scowled down at her
husband, a hawk ready to stoop on a mouse. Not that Bashere looked
anything like a mouse, of course; just a much smaller hawk. She
drew a deep breath; Deira could make drawing a deep breath seem a
thing that should cause the earth to tremble. And unhooking her
sheathed dagger from her belt, she laid it in her husband&rsquo;s
hand. &ldquo;We will talk of this later, Davram,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;At
length.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One day when he had time, Rand decided, he was going
to make Bashere explain how he did that. If there ever was
time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At length,&rdquo; Bashere agreed, grinning through his
mustaches as he stuffed the dagger behind his own belt. Maybe the
man was simply suicidal.</p>

<p>The rope had been taken down outside, and Rand stood
waiting with Dashiva and the other Asha&rsquo;man while nine
thousand Saldaean light horse arrayed themselves behind Bashere in
a column of threes. Somewhere behind them, fifteen thousand men who
called themselves the Legion of the Dragon would be gathering
afoot. Rand had glimpsed them, every one in a blue coat made to
button up the side so the red-and-gold Dragon across the chest
would not be broken. Most carried steel-armed crossbows; some bore
heavy unwieldy shields instead, but not one carried a pike.
Whatever odd notion Mat and Bashere had cooked up, Rand hoped it
would not lead a lot of this legion to death.</p>

<p>Morr grinned eagerly while he waited, all but
bouncing on his toes. Perhaps he was simply glad to be back in his
black coat with the silver sword on his collar, yet Adley and
Narishma wore almost identical grins, and for that matter,
Flinn&rsquo;s was not far off. They knew where they were going now,
and what to do there. Dashiva scowled at nothing as usual, his lips
moving silently. As usual. Also silent, scowling, were the Saldaean
women gathered behind Deira, watching from one side. Eagles and
falcons, feathers ruffled and furious. Rand did not care how they
grimaced and frowned; if he could face Nandera and the rest of the
Maidens after keeping them back from this, then the Saldaean men
could put up with any number of lengthy discussions. Today, the
Light willing, no women would die because of him.</p>

<p>So many men could not be lined up in a minute, even
when they had been awaiting the order, but in a remarkably short
time, Bashere raised his sword and called, &ldquo;My Lord Dragon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A shout rippled down the great column behind him. &ldquo;The Lord Dragon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seizing the Source, Rand made a gateway between the
posts, four paces by four, and ran through as he tied off the
weave, filled with <em>saidin</em> and the Asha&rsquo;man on his
heels, into a great open square surrounded by huge white columns,
each topped with a marble wreath of olive branches. At the two ends
of the square stood nearly identical purple-roofed palaces of
columned walks and high balconies and slender spires. Those were
the King&rsquo;s Palace and the slightly smaller Great Hall of the
Council, and this was the Square of Tammuz, in the heart of
Illian.</p>

<p>A skinny man in a blue coat, with a beard that left
his upper lip bare, stood gaping at the sight of Rand and the black
coated Asha&rsquo;man leaping out of a hole in midair, and a stout
woman, in a green dress cut high enough to show green slippers and
her ankles in green stockings, pressed both hands to her face and
stood rooted right in front of them, her dark eyes popping. All the
people were stopping to stare, hawkers with their trays, carters
halting their oxen, men and women and children with their mouths
hanging open.</p>

<p>Rand thrust his hands high and channeled. &ldquo;I am the
Dragon Reborn!&rdquo; The words boomed across the square, amplified by
Air and Fire, and flames shot up from his hands a hundred feet.
Behind him, the Asha&rsquo;man filled the sky with balls of fire
streaking in every direction. All save Dashiva, who made blue
lightnings crackle in a jagged web above the square.</p>

<p>No more was needed. A shrieking flood of humanity
fled in all directions, away from the Square of Tammuz. They fled
just in time. Rand and the Asha&rsquo;man darted aside from the
gateway, and Davram Bashere led his wildly screaming Saldaeans into
Illian, a flood of horsemen waving their swords as they poured out.
Straight ahead Bashere led the center line of the column, just as
they had planned what seemed so long ago, while the other two lines
peeled off to either side. They streamed away from the gateway,
breaking apart into smaller groups, galloping into the streets
leading out of the square.</p>

<p>Rand did not wait to see the last of the horsemen
exit. With well under a third out of the gateway, he immediately
wove another, smaller opening. You did not need to know a place at
all to Travel if you only intended to go a very short distance.
Around him he felt Dashiva and the rest weaving their gateways, but
he was already stepping through his own, letting it close behind
him atop one of the slender towers of the King&rsquo;s Palace.
Absently he wondered whether Mattin Stepaneos den Balgar, the King
of Illian, was somewhere below him at that moment.</p>

<p>The top of the spire stretched no more than five
paces across, surrounded by a wall of red stone not quite
chest-high on him. At fifty paces, it was the highest point in all
of the city. From there he could see across rooftops glittering
beneath the afternoon sun, red and green and every color, to the
long earthen causeways that cut through the vast tall-grass marsh
surrounding city and harbor. A sharp tang of salt hung in the air.
Illian had no need of walls, with that all-enveloping marsh to stop
an attacker. Any attacker who could not make holes in the air. But
then, walls would have done no good either.</p>

<p>It was a pretty city, the buildings mainly of pale
dressed stone, a city crisscrossed by as many canals as streets,
like traceries of blue-green from this height, but he did not stop
to admire it. Low across the roofs of taverns and shops and spired
palaces he directed flows of Air and Water, Fire and Earth and
Spirit, turning as he did so. He did not try to weave the flows,
simply swept them out over the city and a good mile out over the
marsh. From five other towers came flows sweeping low, and where
they touched one another uncontrolled, light flashed and sparks
flared and clouds of colored steam burst, a display any Illuminator
might have envied. A better way to frighten people under their beds
and out of the way of Bashere&rsquo;s soldiers, he could not
imagine, though that was not the reason for it.</p>

<p>Long ago he had decided that Sammael must have wards
woven throughout the city, set to give an alarm should anyone
channel <em>saidin</em>. Wards inverted so no one except Sammael
himself could find them, wards that would tell Sammael exactly
where that man was channeling so he could be destroyed on the
instant. With luck, every one of those wards was being triggered
now. Lews Therin had been sure Sammael would sense them wherever he
was, even at a distance. That was why the wardings should be
useless now; that sort had to be remade once triggered. Sammael
would come. Never in his life had he relinquished anything he
considered his, however shaky his claim, not without a fight. All
that from Lews Therin. If he was real. He had to be. Those memories
had too much detail. But could not a madman dream his fancies in
detail, too?</p>

<p><em>Lews Therin!</em> he called silently. The wind
blowing across Illian answered.</p>

<p>Below, the Square of Tammuz stood deserted and
silent, empty except for a few abandoned carts. Edge-on, the
gateway was invisible except for the weaves.</p>

<p>Reaching down to those weaves, Rand untied the knot
and, as the gateway winked from existence, reluctantly released
<em>saidin</em>. All the flows vanished from the sky. Maybe some of
the Asha&rsquo;man still held on to the Source, but he had told them
not to. He had told them that any man he felt channeling in Illian
once he himself stopped, he intended to kill without warning. He
did not want to find out afterward that the channeler had been one
of them. He leaned on the wall, waiting, wishing he could sit. His
legs ached and his side burned however he stood, yet he might need
to see as well as feel a weave.</p>

<p>The city was not entirely quiet. From several
directions he could hear distant shouts, the faint clash of metal.
Even moving so many men to the border, Sammael had not left Illian
entirely unprotected. Rand turned, trying to watch in every
direction. He thought Sammael would come to the King&rsquo;s Palace
or that other at the far end of the square, but he could not be
certain. Down one street he saw a band of Saldaeans clashing with
an equal number of mounted men in shining breastplates; more
Saldaeans suddenly galloped in from one side, and the fight
vanished from his sight behind buildings. In another direction he
spotted some of the Legion of the Dragon, marching across a
canal&rsquo;s low bridge. An officer marked by a tall red plume on
his helmet strode ahead of some twenty men carrying wide shields as
tall as their shoulders, followed by perhaps two hundred more with
heavy crossbows. How would they fight? Shouts and steel ringing on
steel in the distance, the faint screams of dying men.</p>

<p>The sun slid downward, and shadows lengthened across
the city. Twilight, and the sun a low crimson dome in the west. A
few stars appeared. Had he been wrong? Would Sammael simply go
elsewhere, find another land to master? Had he been listening to
anything other than his own mad ramblings?</p>

<p>A man channeled. For a moment, Rand froze, staring at
the Great Hall of the Council. That had been enough of
<em>saidin</em> for a gateway; he might not have felt a much
smaller channeling, the length of the square. It had to be
Sammael.</p>

<p>In an instant he had seized the Source, woven a
gateway and leaped through with lightning ready to fly from his
hands. It was a large room, lit by huge mirrored golden stand-lamps
and others hanging on chains from the ceiling, with snowy marble
walls carved in friezes showing battles, and ships crowding the
marsh-bordered harbor of Illian itself. At the far end of the room,
nine heavily carved and gilded armchairs stood like thrones atop a
high stair-fronted white dais, the center chair with a back higher
than any other. Before he could release the gateway behind him, the
tower top where he had stood exploded. He felt the wash of Fire and
Earth even as a storm of stone fragments and dust struck through
the gateway, knocking him down on his face. Pain stabbed his side
as he landed, a sharp red lance digging into the Void where he
floated, and that as much as anything else made him release the
gateway. Someone else&rsquo;s pain; someone else&rsquo;s weakness. He
could ignore them, in the Void.</p>

<p>He moved, forcing another man&rsquo;s muscles to work,
pushed himself up and scrambled away in a lurching run toward the
dais just as hundreds of red filaments burned down through the
ceiling, burned through the sea-blue marble floor in a wide circle
all around where the residue of his gateway was still fading. One
stabbed through the heel of his boot, through his heel, and he
heard himself cry out as he fell. Not his pain, in side or foot.
Not his.</p>

<p>Rolling onto his back, he could see the remnants of
those burning red wires still, fresh enough to make out Fire and
Air woven in a way he had not known. Enough to make out exactly the
direction they had come from. Black holes in the floor and ornately
worked white plaster ceiling high overhead hissed and crackled
loudly at the touch of the air.</p>

<p>His hands rose, and he wove balefire. Began to weave
it. Someone else&rsquo;s cheek stung from a remembered slap, and
Cadsuane&rsquo;s voice hissed and crackled in his head like the
holes the red filaments had made. <em>Never again, boy; you will
never do that again</em>. It seemed that he heard Lews Therin
whimpering in distant fear of what he was about to loose, what had
almost destroyed the world once. Every flow but Fire and Air fell
away, and he wove as he had seen. A thousand fine hairs of red
blossomed between his hands, fanning out slightly they shot upward.
A circle of the ceiling two feet across fell in stone chips and
plaster dust.</p>

<p>Only after he had done it did he think that there
might be someone between him and Sammael. He intended to see
Sammael dead this day, but if he could do it without killing anyone
else&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The weaves vanished as he pulled himself to his feet
once more and limped hurriedly to the doors in the side of the
hall, tall things with every panel set with nine golden bees the
size of his fist.</p>

<p>A small flow of Air pushed one door open before he
reached it, too small to be detected at any distance. Hobbling into
the corridor, he sank to one knee. That other man&rsquo;s side was
fire, his heel agony. Rand pulled his sword up and leaned on it,
waiting. A clean-shaven fellow with plump pink cheeks peered around
a corner down the way; enough of his coat showed to name him a
servant. At least, a coat green on one side and yellow on the other
looked like livery. The fellow saw Rand and, very slowly, as though
he might not be noticed if he moved slowly enough, slid back out of
sight. Sooner or later, Sammael would have to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Illian belongs to me!&rdquo; The voice boomed in the air,
from every direction, and Rand cursed. That had to be the same
weave he himself had used in the square, or something very like; it
required so little of the Power he might not have felt the actual
flows had he been within ten paces of the man. &ldquo;Illian is mine! I
won&rsquo;t destroy what belongs to me killing you, and I won&rsquo;t
let you destroy it, either. You had the nerve to come after me
here? Do you have the courage to follow me again?&rdquo; A sly mocking
tone entering that thundering voice. &ldquo;Do you have the courage?&rdquo;
Somewhere above, a gateway opened and closed; Rand had no doubt
that was what it was.</p>

<p>The courage? Did he have the <em>courage</em>? &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the Dragon Reborn,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m going to
kill you.&rdquo; Weaving a gateway, he stepped through, to a place floors
above.</p>

<p>It was another hallway, lined with wall hangings
showing ships at sea. At the far end, the last crimson sliver of
the sun shone through a colonnaded walk. The residue of
Sammael&rsquo;s gateway hung in the air, the dissipating flows like
faintly glowing ghosts. Not so faint Rand could not make them out,
though. He began to weave, then stopped. He had leaped up here
without a thought of a trap. If he copied what he saw exactly, he
would step out wherever Sammael had, or so close as made no
difference. But with just a slight alteration; no way to be sure
whether the change was fifty feet or five hundred, yet either was
close enough.</p>

<p>The vertical silver slash began to rotate open,
revealing the shadow-cloaked ruins of greatness, not quite as dark
as the hallway. Seen through the gateway, the sun was a slightly
thicker slice of red, half-hidden by a shattered dome. He knew that
place. The last time he had gone there, he had added a name to that
list of Maidens in his head; the first time, Padan Fain had
followed and become more than a Darkfriend, worse than a
Darkfriend. That Sammael had fled to Shadar Logoth seemed like
coming full circle in more ways that one. There was no time to
waste now that he was opening the way. Before the gateway stopped
widening, he ran through into the ravaged city that once had been
called Aridhol, ran limping, letting the weave go as he ran, boots
crunching on broken paving stones and dead weeds.</p>

<p>The first corner he came to, he ducked around. The
ground shook under his feet as roars sounded back the way he had
come, light flashing atop flash in the twilight darkness; he felt
the wash of Earth and Fire and Air. Shrieks and bellows rose
through the thunderous crashes. <em>Saidin</em> pulsing inside him,
he hobbled away without looking back. He ran, and with the Power
filling him, even in the dark shadows he could see clearly.</p>

<p>All around the great city lay, huge marble palaces
each with four and five domes of different shapes painted crimson
by the setting sun, bronze fountains and statues at every
intersection, great stretches of columns running to towers that
soared across the sun. They soared when intact, at least; more
ended in abrupt jaggedness than not. For every dome that stood
whole, ten were broken eggshells with the top hacked off or one
side gone. Statues lay toppled in fragments, or stood with missing
arms, or heads. Swiftly deepening darkness raced across sprawling
hills of rubble, the few stunted trees clinging to their slopes
twisted shapes like broken fingers against the sky.</p>

<p>A fan of bricks and stone spread across the way from
what might have been a small palace; half its front missing, the
rest of the columned fa&ccedil;ade leaned drunkenly toward the
street. He stopped in the middle of the street, just short of the
fan, waiting, feeling for another to use <em>saidin</em>. Clinging
to the sides of the street was not a good idea, and not simply
because any building might fall at any time. A thousand unseen eyes
seemed to watch from windows like gouged eye sockets, to watch with
a nearly palpable sense of anticipation. Distantly he felt the new
wound in his side throbbing, a slash of flame, echoing the evil
that clung to the very dust of Shadar Logoth. The old scar clenched
like a fist. The pain of his foot seemed very distant indeed.
Closer, the Void itself pulsated around him, the Dark One&rsquo;s
taint on <em>saidin</em> beating in time with the knife slash
across his ribs. A dangerous place by daylight, Shadar Logoth. By
night&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Down the street, beyond a spired monument
miraculously standing straight, something moved, a shadowed shape
darting across the way in the darkness. Rand almost channeled, but
he could not believe Sammael would go scuttling that way. When he
first stepped into the city, when Sammael tried to destroy
everything around his gateway, he had heard horrible screams. They
had barely registered, then. Nothing lived in Shadar Logoth, not
even rats. Sammael must have brought henchmen, fellows he did not
mind killing in an attempt to reach Rand. Maybe one of them could
lead Rand to Sammael. He hurried forward as fast as he could, as
soundlessly as he could. Shattered pavement crunched under his
boots with a sound like bones snapping. He hoped it was loud only
to his <em>saidin</em>-enhanced ears.</p>

<p>Stopping at the base of the spire, a thick stone
needle covered with flowing script, he peered ahead. Whoever had
moved was gone; only fools or the madly brave went inside in Shadar
Logoth at night. The evil that stained Shadar Logoth, the evil that
had murdered Aridhol, had not died with Aridhol. Farther along the
street, a tendril of silver-gray fog wavered out of a window,
creeping toward another that came to meet it from a wide gap in a
high stone wall. The depths of that gap shone as though a full moon
lay inside. With the night, Mashadar roamed its city prison, a vast
presence that could appear in a dozen places at once, a hundred.
Mashadar&rsquo;s touch was not a pleasant way to die. Inside Rand,
the taint on <em>saidin</em> beat harder; the distant fire in his
side flickered like ten thousand lightnings, one on top of the
last. Even the ground seemed to pound beneath his boots.</p>

<p>He turned, half-thinking to leave now. Very likely,
Sammael had gone, now that Mashadar was out. Very likely the man
had lured him here in the hope he would search the ruins until
Mashadar killed him. He turned, and stopped, crouching against the
spire. Two Trollocs were creeping down that street, bulky shapes in
black mail, half again as tall as he, or more. Spikes stood out on
the shoulders and elbows of their armor, and they carried spears
with long black points and wicked hooks. To his
<em>saidin</em>-filled eyes, their faces stood out clearly, one
distorted by an eagle&rsquo;s beak where mouth and nose should have
been, the other by a boar&rsquo;s tusked snout. Every line of their
creeping shouted fear; Trollocs loved killing, loved blood, but
Shadar Logoth terrified them. There would be Myrddraal about; no
Trolloc would have entered this city without Myrddraal to drive it.
No Myrddraal would have entered without Sammael driving. All of
which meant Sammael must still be here, or these Trollocs would be
running for the gates, not hunting. And they were hunting. That
boar&rsquo;s snout was snuffling the air for a scent.</p>

<p>Abruptly a figure in rags leaped from a window above
the Trollocs, falling on them with spear already stabbing. An Aiel,
a woman, <em>shoufa</em> wrapped around her head but veil hanging.
The eagle-beaked Trolloc shrieked as her spearpoint stabbed deep
into its side, stabbed again. As its companion fell, kicking,
boar-snout spun with snarl, thrusting viciously, but she ducked low
under the black hooked point and stabbed up into the
creature&rsquo;s stomach, and it went down in a thrashing heap with
the other.</p>

<p>Rand was on his feet and running before he thought. &ldquo;Liah!&rdquo; he shouted. He had thought her dead, abandoned here by him,
dead for him. Liah, of the Cosaida Chareen; that name blazed on the
list in his head.</p>

<p>She whirled to confront him, spear ready in one hand,
round bull-hide buckler in the other. The face he remembered as
pretty despite scars on both cheeks was contorted with rage. &ldquo;Mine!&rdquo; she hissed threateningly through her teeth. &ldquo;Mine! No one
may come here! No one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped in his tracks. That spear waited, eager to
seek his ribs too. &ldquo;Liah, you know me,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;You know
me. I&rsquo;ll take you back to the Maidens, back to your
spear-sisters.&rdquo; He held out his hand.</p>

<p>Her rage melted into a twisted frown. She tilted her
head to one side. &ldquo;Rand al&rsquo;Thor?&rdquo; she said slowly. Her eyes
widened, falling to the dead Trollocs, and a look of horror spread
across her face. &ldquo;Rand al&rsquo;Thor,&rdquo; she whispered, fumbling the
black veil into place across her face with the hand that held her
spear. &ldquo;The <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>!&rdquo; she wailed. And
fled.</p>

<p>He hobbled after her, scrambling over piles of rubble
spread across the street, falling, ripping his coat, falling again
and nearly ripping it off, rolling and picking himself up on the
run. The weakness of his body was distant, and the pain of it, but
even floating deep in the Void, he could only push that body so
hard. Liah vanished into the night. Around the next black-shadowed
corner, he thought.</p>

<p>He limped around that as fast as he could. And nearly
ran into four black mailed Trollocs and a Myrddraal, inky cloak
hanging unnaturally still down its back as the Fade moved. The
Trollocs snarled in surprise, yet shock lasted less than a
heartbeat. Hooked spears and scythe-curved swords rose; the
Myrddraal&rsquo;s dead-black blade was in its fist, a blade that
gave wounds almost as deadly as Fain&rsquo;s dagger.</p>

<p>Rand did not even try to draw the heron-mark sword at
his side. Death in a tattered red coat, he channeled, and a sword
of fire was in his hands, pulsing darkly with the throb of
<em>saidin</em>, sweeping an eyeless head from its shoulders.
Simpler to have destroyed them all the way he had seen the
Asha&rsquo;man kill at Dumai&rsquo;s Wells, but changing the weaves
now, trying to change, might take a fatal moment. Those swords
could kill even him. He danced the forms in a darkness lit by the
flame in his hands, shadows flying across faces above him, faces
with wolves&rsquo; muzzles and goats&rsquo; faces contorted in
screams as his fiery blade sliced through black mail and the flesh
beneath as if they were water. Trollocs depended on numbers and
overwhelming ferocity; facing him, and that sword of the Power,
they might as well have stood stock-still, unarmed.</p>

<p>The sword vanished from his hands. Still poised at
the end of the form called Twisting the Wind, he stood among death.
The last Trolloc to fall still thrashed, goat horns scraping on the
fragmented pavement. The headless Myrddraal yet flung its arms
about, of course, booted feet scrabbling wildly; Halfmen did not
die quickly, even headless.</p>

<p>No sooner did the sword disappear than silver
lightning lanced down from the cloudless, starry sky.</p>

<p>The first bolt struck with a deafening roar not four
paces away. The world turned white, and the Void collapsed. The
ground bounced under him as another bolt struck, and another. He
had not realized he was on his face until then. The air crackled.
Dazed, he pushed himself up, half falling as he ran from a hail of
lightning that ripped the street apart to a thunder of collapsing
buildings. Straight ahead he staggered, not caring where, so long
as it was away.</p>

<p>Suddenly his head cleared enough for him to see where
he was, reeling across a vast stone floor covered with tumbled
chunks of stone, some as big as he. Here and there, dark uneven
holes gaped in the floorstones. All around rose high walls, and
tier upon tier of deep balconies that ran all the way around. Only
a small portion of what had once been a vast roof remained, at one
corner. Stars shone bright overhead.</p>

<p>He lurched another step, and the floor gave way
beneath him. Desperately he flung out his hands; with a jolt, the
right hand caught hold of a rough edge. He dangled into
pitch-blackness. The fall beneath his boots might be a few spans
into a basement, or a mile for all he could tell. He could latch
bands of Air to the jagged rim of the hole above his head to help
pull himself out, except&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;somehow, Sammael had sensed the
relatively small amount of <em>saidin</em> used in the sword. There
had been a delay before the lightnings struck, but he could not say
how long he had taken killing the Trollocs. A minute? Seconds?</p>

<p>With a heave, he swung his left arm up, trying to
catch the edge of the hole. Pain no longer buffered by the
Void stabbed through his side like a dagger going in. Spots danced
in his vision. Worse, his right hand slipped on crumbling stone,
and he could feel his fingers weakening. He was going to have to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A hand grabbed his right wrist. &ldquo;You are a fool,&rdquo; a
man&rsquo;s deep voice said. &ldquo;Count yourself lucky I don&rsquo;t care
to see you die today.&rdquo; The hand began drawing him up. &ldquo;Are you
going to help?&rdquo; the voice demanded. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t intend to carry
you on my shoulders, or kill Sammael for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shaking off his shock, Rand reached up and grabbed
the rim of the hole, pulling despite the agony of his side. Despite
the agony, he managed to acquire the Void again, too, and seize
<em>saidin</em>. He did not channel, but he wanted to be ready.</p>

<p>His head and shoulders came above the floor, and he
could see the other man, a big fellow little older than he, with
hair black as the night and a coat black as an
Asha&rsquo;man&rsquo;s. Rand had never seen him before. At least he
was not one of the Forsaken; those faces he knew. He thought he
did, anyway. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>Still heaving, the man barked a laugh. &ldquo;Just say
I&rsquo;m a wanderer passing through. Do you really want to talk
now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Saving his breath, Rand struggled upward, getting his
chest over the lip, his waist. Abruptly he realized that a glow
bathed the floor around them like the glow of a full moon.</p>

<p>Twisting to look over his shoulder, he saw Mashadar.
Not a tendril, but a shining silver-gray wave rolling out of one of
the balconies, arching over their heads. Descending.</p>

<p>Without a thought, his free hand rose, and balefire
shot upward, a bar of liquid white fire slicing across the wave
sinking toward them. Dimly he was aware of another bar of pale
solid fire rising from the other man&rsquo;s hand that was not
clasping his, a bar slashing the opposite way from his. The two
touched.</p>

<p>Head ringing like a struck gong, Rand convulsed,
<em>saidin</em> and the Void shattering. Everything was doubled in
his eyes, the balconies, the chunks of stone lying about the floor.
There seemed to be a pair of the other man overlapping one another,
each clutching his head between two hands. Blinking, Rand searched
for Mashadar. The wave of shining mist was gone; a glow remained in
the balconies above, but dimming, receding, as Rand&rsquo;s eyes
began to clear. Even mindless Mashadar fled balefire, it
seemed.</p>

<p>Unsteadily, he got to his feet and offered a hand. &ldquo;I
think we best move quickly. What happened there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other man pushed himself up with a grimace at
Rand&rsquo;s proffered hand. He was easily as tall as Rand, rare
except among the Aiel. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what happened,&rdquo; he
snarled. &ldquo;Run, if you want to live.&rdquo; He suited his own words
immediately, dashing toward a row of open arches. Not in the
nearest wall. Mashadar had come from that one.</p>

<p>Fumbling for the Void, Rand limped after him as fast
as he could, but before they were completely across the floor, the
lightnings fell again, a storm of silver arrows. The two of them
darted through the archways pursued by the thunder of walls and
floor collapsing behind them, by clouds of dust and a hail of
stones. Shoulders hunched and an arm across his face, Rand ran
coughing through a broad room where trembling arches supported the
ceiling and bits of stone rained down.</p>

<p>He burst out into a street before he knew it,
stumbling three steps before stopping. The pain in his side made
him want to bend over, but he thought his legs might give way if he
did. His wounded foot throbbed; it seemed a year ago that that red
wire of Fire and Air had stabbed his heel. His rescuer stood
watching him; covered with dust head to toe, the fellow managed to
look a king.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Rand asked again. &ldquo;One of Taim&rsquo;s
men? Or did you teach yourself? You can go to Caemlyn, you know, to
the Black Tower. You don&rsquo;t have to live afraid of Aes Sedai.&rdquo;
For some reason, saying that made him frown; he could not
understand why.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never been afraid of Aes Sedai,&rdquo; the man
snapped, then drew a deep breath. &ldquo;You probably should leave here
now, but if you intend to stay and kill Sammael, you had better try
thinking like him. You have shown you can. He always liked
destroying a man in sight of one of that man&rsquo;s triumphs, if he
could. Lacking that, somewhere the man had marked as his would
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Waygate,&rdquo; Rand said slowly. If he could be said
to have marked anything in Shadar Logoth, it had to be the Waygate. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s waiting near the Waygate. And he has traps set.&rdquo; Wards
as well, it seemed, like those in Illian, to detect a man
channeling. Sammael had planned this well.</p>

<p>The man laughed wryly. &ldquo;You can find the way, it
seems. If you&rsquo;re led by the hand. Try not to stumble. A great
many plans will have to be relaid if you let yourself be killed
now.&rdquo; Turning, he started across the street for an alleyway just
ahead of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; Rand called. The fellow kept on, not looking
back. &ldquo;Who are you? What plans?&rdquo; The man vanished into the
alley.</p>

<p>Rand teetered after him, but when he reached the
mouth of the narrow alley, it was empty. Unbroken walls ran a good
hundred paces to another street, where a glow told of yet another
part of Mashadar abroad, but the man was gone. Which was purely
impossible. The fellow had had time to make a gateway, of course,
if he knew how, but the residue would have been visible, and
besides, that much of <em>saidin</em> being woven so near would
have shouted at him.</p>

<p>Suddenly he realized that he had not felt
<em>saidin</em> when the man made balefire, either. Just thinking
of that, of the two streams touching, made his vision double again.
Just for an instant, he could see the man&rsquo;s face again, sharp
where everything else blurred. He shook his head until it cleared. &ldquo;Who in the Light are you?&rdquo; he whispered. And after a moment, &ldquo;What
in the Light are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whoever or whatever, the man was gone, though.
Sammael was still in Shadar Logoth. With an effort he managed to
regain the Void once more. The taint on <em>saidin</em> vibrated
now, humming its way deep into him; the Void itself vibrated. But
the weakness of watery muscles and the pain of injuries faded. He
<em>was</em> going to kill one of the Forsaken before this night
was done.</p>

<p>Limping, he ghosted through the dark streets, placing
his feet with great care. He still made noise, but the night was
full of noise now. Shrieks and guttural cries sounded in the
distance. Mindless Mashadar killed whatever it found, and Trollocs
were dying in Shadar Logoth tonight as they had once long, long
ago. Sometimes down a crossing street he saw Trollocs, two or five
or a dozen, occasionally with a Halfman but most often not. None
saw him, and he did not bother them. Not simply because Sammael
would detect any channeling. Those Trollocs and Myrddraal that
Mashadar did not kill were still dead. Sammael had almost certainly
brought them by the Ways, but apparently he did not realize just
how Rand had marked the Waygate here.</p>

<p>Well short of the square where the Waygate lay, Rand
stopped and looked around. Nearby, a tower stood seemingly whole.
Not nearly as tall as some, its top still rose more than fifty
paces above the ground. The dark doorway at its base was empty, the
wood long rotted away and the hinges gone to dust. Through
blackness relieved only by faint starlight through the windows, he
climbed the winding stairs slowly, small clouds puffing up beneath
his boots, every second step a stab of pain up his leg. Distant
pain. On the tower top, he leaned against the smooth parapet to
catch his breath. The idle thought came that he would never hear
the end if Min learned of this. Min, or Amys, or Cadsuane for that
matter.</p>

<p>Across missing rooftops, he could see the great
square that had been one of the most important in Aridhol. Once an
Ogier grove had covered this part of the land, but within thirty
years after the Ogier who had built the oldest parts of the city
departed, the residents had cut down the trees to make room for
expanding Aridhol. Palaces and the remains of palaces surrounded
the huge square, the glow of Mashadar shining deep inside a few
windows, and a huge mound of rubble covered one end, but in the
center stood the Waygate, apparently a tall broad piece of stone.
He was not close enough to see the delicately carved leaves and
vines that covered it, but he could make out the toppled pieces of
high fence that had once surrounded it. Power-wrought metal lying
in a heap, they gleamed untarnished in the night. He could also see
the trap he had woven around the Waygate, inverted so no eye but
his could see it. No way to tell by looking whether the Trollocs
and Halfmen really had passed through it, yet if they had, they
would die before long. A nasty thing. Whatever traps Sammael had
made down there were invisible to him, but that was expected.
Likely they were not very pleasant either.</p>

<p>At first, he could not see Sammael, but then someone
moved among the fluted, flaring columns of a palace. Rand waited.
He wanted to be sure; he had only one chance. The figure stepped
forward, out of the columns and a pace into the square, head
swinging this way and that. Sammael, with snowy lace shining at his
throat, waiting to see Rand walk into the square, into the traps.
Behind him, the glow in the windows of the palace brightened.
Sammael peered into the darkness lying across the square, and
Mashadar oozed out of the windows, thick billows of silver-gray fog
sliding together, merging as they loomed above his head. Sammael
walked a little to one side, and the wave began to descend, slowly
picking up speed as it fell.</p>

<p>Rand shook his head. Sammael was his. The flows
needed for balefire seemed to gather themselves, despite the far
echo of Cadsuane&rsquo;s voice. He raised his hand.</p>

<p>A scream tore the darkness, a woman shrieking in
agony beyond knowing. Rand saw Sammael turn to stare toward the
great mound of rubble even as his own eyes flashed that way. Atop
the mound a shape stood outlined against the night sky in coat and
breeches, a single thin tendril of Mashadar touching her leg. Arms
outstretched, she thrashed about, unable to move from the spot, and
her wordless wail seemed to call Rand&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Liah,&rdquo; he whispered. Unconsciously he reached out,
as though he could stretch his arm across the intervening distance
and pull her away. Nothing could save what Mashadar touched,
though, no more than anything could have saved him had Fain&rsquo;s
dagger plunged into his heart. &ldquo;Liah,&rdquo; he whispered. And balefire
leaped from his hand.</p>

<p>For less than a heartbeat, the shape of her still
seemed to be there, all in stark blacks and snowy whites, and then
she was gone, dead before her agony began.</p>

<p>Screaming, Rand swept the balefire down toward the
square, the rubble collapsing on itself, swept down death out of
time&mdash;and let <em>saidin</em> go before the bar of white
touched the lake of Mashadar that now rolled across the square,
billowing past the Waygate toward rivers of glowing gray that
flowed out from another palace on the other side. Sammael had to be
dead. He had to be. There had not been time for him to run, no time
to weave a gateway, and if he had, Rand would have felt
<em>saidin</em> being worked. Sammael was dead, killed by an evil
almost as great as himself. Emotion raced across the outside of the
Void; Rand wanted to laugh, or perhaps cry. He had come here to
kill one of the Forsaken, but instead he had killed a woman he had
abandoned here to her fate.</p>

<p>For a long time he stood on the tower top while the
waning moon crossed the sky, almost at its half, stood watching
Mashadar fill the square completely, till only the very top of the
Waygate rose above the surface of the fog. Slowly it began to ebb
away, hunting elsewhere. If Sammael had been alive, he could have
killed the Dragon Reborn easily then. Rand was not sure that he
would have cared. Finally he opened a gateway for Skimming and made
a platform, a railless disc, half white and half black. Skimming
was slower than Traveling; it took him at least half an hour to
reach Illian, and the whole way, he burned Liah&rsquo;s name into
his mind again and again, flailing himself with it. He wished he
could cry. He thought he had forgotten how.</p>

<p>They were waiting for him in the King&rsquo;s Palace,
in the throne room. Bashere, and Dashiva and the Asha&rsquo;man. It
was exactly like the room he had seen at the other end of the
square, down to the stand-lamps and the scenes carved into the
marble walls and the long white dais. Exactly the same except for
being slightly larger in every dimension, and instead of nine
chairs on the dais, there was only a great gilded throne with
leopards for its arms and nine fist-sized golden bees that would
stand above the head of whoever sat in it. Wearily Rand sat himself
down on the steps at the front of the dais.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I take it Sammael is dead,&rdquo; Bashere said, looking
him up and down in his ragged coat and dust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead,&rdquo; Rand said. Dashiva sighed loudly
with relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The city is ours,&rdquo; Bashere went on. &ldquo;Or I should
say, yours.&rdquo; He laughed suddenly. &ldquo;The fighting stopped quick
enough once the right people found out it was you. Not much to it,
in the end.&rdquo; Dried blood made a black stain down one torn sleeve of
his coat. &ldquo;The Council has been waiting eagerly for you to come
back. Anxiously, you might say,&rdquo; he added with a wry grin.</p>

<p>Eight sweating men had been standing at the far end
of the throne room since Rand came in. They wore dark silk coats
with gold or silver embroidery on the lapels and sleeves, and falls
of lace at their throats and wrists. Some wore a beard that left
the upper lip shaved clean, but every one had a broad sash of green
silk slanted across his chest, with nine golden bees marching up
it.</p>

<p>At Bashere&rsquo;s gesture they came forward, bowing
to Rand at about every third step, for all the world as though he
wore the finest garments sewn. A tall man seemed to be the leader,
a round-faced fellow with one of those beards, with a natural
dignity that appeared strained by worry. &ldquo;My Lord Dragon,&rdquo; he said,
bowing again and pressing both hands to his heart. &ldquo;Forgive me, but
Lord Brend do be nowhere to be found, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; Rand said flatly.</p>

<p>A muscle in the man&rsquo;s face jumped at Rand&rsquo;s
tone, and he swallowed. &ldquo;As you do say, my Lord Dragon,&rdquo; he
murmured. &ldquo;I do be Lord Gregorin den Lushenos, my Lord Dragon. In
Lord Brend&rsquo;s absence, I do speak for the Council of Nine. We
do offer you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; A hand at his side waved vigorously at a
shorter, beardless man, who stepped forward bearing a cushion
draped with a length of green silk. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;we do offer you
Illian.&rdquo; The shorter man whipped the cloth away, revealing a heavy
gold circlet, two inches wide, of laurel leaves. &ldquo;The city do be
yours, of course,&rdquo; Gregorin went on anxiously. &ldquo;We did put an end
to all resistance. We do offer you the crown, and the throne, and
all of Illian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stared at the crown on its cushion, not moving a
muscle. People had thought he meant to make himself a king in Tear,
feared he would in Cairhien and Andor, but no one had
<em>offered</em> him a crown before. &ldquo;Why? Is Mattin Stepaneos so
willing to give up his throne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;King Mattin did disappear two days ago,&rdquo; Gregorin
said. &ldquo;Some of us do fear&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;We do fear Lord Brend may have
something to with it. Brend does have&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He stopped to
swallow. &ldquo;Brend did have a great deal of influence with the king,
some might say too much, but he did be distracted in recent months,
and Mattin had begun to reassert himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Strips of grimy coatsleeve and pieces of shirtsleeve
dangled as Rand reached to pick up the Laurel Crown. The Dragon
wound around his forearm glittered in the lamplight as brightly as
the golden crown. He turned it in his hands. &ldquo;You still
haven&rsquo;t said why. Because I conquered you?&rdquo; He had conquered
Tear, and Cairhien too, but some turned on him in both lands still.
Yet it seemed to be the only way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That do be part,&rdquo; Gregorin said dryly. &ldquo;Even so, we
might have chosen one of our own; kings have come from the Council
before. But the grain you did order sent from Tear has your name on
every lip with the Light. Without that, many would be dead of
starvation. Brend did see every stick of bread go to the army.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand blinked, and snatched one hand from the crown to
suck on a pricked finger. Almost buried among the laurel leaves of
the crown were the sharp points of swords. How long ago had he
commanded the Tairens to sell grain to their ancient enemy, sell it
or die for refusing? He had not realized they kept on after he
began preparations to invade Illian. Maybe they feared to bring it
up, but they had feared to stop, too. Maybe he had earned some
right to this crown.</p>

<p>Gingerly he set the circle of laurel leaves on his
head. Half those swords pointed up, half down. No head would wear
this crown casually or easily.</p>

<p>Gregorin bowed smoothly. &ldquo;The Light illumine Rand
al&rsquo;Thor, King of Illian,&rdquo; he intoned, and the seven other
lords bowed with him, murmuring, &ldquo;The Light illumine Rand
al&rsquo;Thor, King of Illian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bashere contented himself with a bow of his head&mdash;he was uncle to a queen, after all&mdash;but Dashiva cried
out, &ldquo;All hail Rand al&rsquo;Thor, King of the World!&rdquo; Flinn and the
other Asha&rsquo;man took it up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All hail Rand al&rsquo;Thor, King of the World!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All hail the King of the World!&rdquo;</p>

<p>That had a good sound to it.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The story spread as stories will, and changed as
stories change with time and distance, spreading out from Illian by
coasting ships, and merchant trains of wagons, and pigeons sent in
secret, spreading in ripples that danced with other ripples and
made new. An army had come to Illian, the stories said, an army of
Aiel, of Aes Sedai appearing from thin air, of men who could
channel riding winged beasts, even an army of Saldaeans, though not
many believed that one. Some tales said the Dragon Reborn had been
presented the Laurel Crown of Illian by the Council of Nine, and
others by Martin Stepaneos himself on bended knee. Some said the
Dragon Reborn had wrenched the crown from Martin&rsquo;s head, then
stuck that head on a spike. No, the Dragon Reborn had razed Illian
to the ground and buried the old king in the rubble. No, he and his
army of Asha&rsquo;man had burned Illian out of the earth. No, it
was Ebou Dar he had destroyed, after Illian.</p>

<p>One fact, though, turned up again and again in those
tales. The Laurel Crown of Illian had been given a new name. The
Crown of Swords.</p>

<p>And for some reason, men and women who told the tales
often found a need to add almost identical words. The storm is
coming, they said, staring southward in worry. The storm is
coming.</p>
