must stop here tomorrow.&rdquo; Egwene shifted
carefully on her folding chair; it had a tendency to fold on its
own, sometimes. &ldquo;Lord Bryne says the army is running short of food.
Our camp is certainly short of everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two stubby tallow candles burned on the wooden table
in front of her. That folded, too, for easy packing, but it was
sturdier than the chair. The candles in the tent that served as her
study were supplemented by an oil lantern hanging from the
centerpole up near the peak. The dim yellow light flickered, making
faint shadows dance on patched canvas walls that were a far cry
from the grandeur of the Amyrlin&rsquo;s study in the White Tower,
but that did not upset her. Truth be known, she herself was some
considerable distance short of the grandeur normally associated
with the Amyrlin Seat. She knew very well that the seven-striped
stole on her shoulders was the only reason any stranger would
believe her Amyrlin. If they did not think it an extremely foolish
joke. Odd things had happened in the White Tower&rsquo;s history&mdash;Siuan had told her secret details of some of them&mdash;yet
surely nothing so odd as her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four or five days would be better,&rdquo; Sheriam mused,
studying the sheaf of papers in her lap. Slightly plump, with high
cheekbones and tilted green eyes, in her dark green riding dress
she managed to look elegant and commanding despite her perch on one
of the two precarious stools in front of the table. Exchange her
narrow blue stole of the Keeper of the Chronicles for the
Amyrlin&rsquo;s, and anyone would think she wore it by right.
Sometimes she certainly seemed to believe the striped stole rested
on her own shoulders. &ldquo;Or perhaps longer. It would not hurt to
build our stores up once more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Siuan, atop the other rickety stool shook her head
slightly, but Egwene did not need the hint. &ldquo;One day.&rdquo; She might be
just eighteen and well short of a true Amyrlin&rsquo;s grandeur, but
she was no fool. Too many of the sisters seized on any excuse for a
halt&mdash;too many of the Sitters, as well&mdash;and if they
stopped too long, it might be impossible to start them moving
again. Sheriam opened her mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One, daughter,&rdquo; Egwene said firmly. Whatever Sheriam
thought, the fact was that Sheriam Bayanar was the Keeper and
Egwene al&rsquo;Vere the Amyrlin. If only Sheriam could be brought
to realize that. And the Hall of the Tower; they were worse. She
wanted to snarl or snap or maybe throw something, but after close
to a month and half, she already had a lifetime&rsquo;s practice in
keeping her face and voice smooth at far greater provocation than
this. &ldquo;Any longer, and we&rsquo;ll begin to strip the countryside
bare. I won&rsquo;t leave people to starve. On the practical side,
if we take too much from them, even paid for, they&rsquo;ll give us
a hundred problems in return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Raids on the herds and flocks and thieves at the
storewagons,&rdquo; Siuan murmured. Studying her divided gray skirts, not
looking at anyone, she seemed to be thinking aloud. &ldquo;Men shooting
at our guards at night, maybe setting fire to whatever they can
reach. A bad business. Hungry people become desperate in a hurry.&rdquo;
Those were the same reasons Lord Bryne had given Egwene, in very
nearly the same words.</p>

<p>The fiery-haired woman shot Siuan a hard look. Many
sisters had a difficult time with Siuan. Her face was probably the
best known in the camp, young enough to have looked proper above an
Accepted&rsquo;s dress, or a novice&rsquo;s for that matter. That was
a side effect of being stilled, though not many had known it; Siuan
could hardly walk a step without sisters staring at her, the once
Amyrlin Seat, deposed and cut off from <em>saidar</em>, then Healed
and restored to at least some ability, when everyone knew that was
impossible. Many welcomed her back warmly as a sister once more,
for herself and for the miracle that held out hope against what
every Aes Sedai feared beyond death, but just as many or more
offered lukewarm toleration or condescension or both, blaming her
for their present situation.</p>

<p>Sheriam was one of those who thought Siuan should
instruct the new young Amyrlin in protocol and the like, which
everyone believed she hated, and keep her mouth closed unless she
was called upon. She was less than she had been, no longer Amyrlin
and no longer anywhere near so strong in the Power. It was not
cruelty as Aes Sedai saw it. The past was past; what was now, was,
and must be accepted. Anything else only brought greater pain. By
and large, Aes Sedai admitted change slowly, but once they did, for
most it was as if things had always been that way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day, Mother, as you say,&rdquo; Sheriam sighed at
last, bowing her head slightly. Less in submission, Egwene was
sure, than to hide a grimace over her stubbornness. She would
accept the grimace if the acquiescence came with it. For the time
being, she had to.</p>

<p>Siuan bowed her head, too. To hide a smile. Any
sister might be appointed to any post, but the social pecking order
was quite rigid, and Siuan stood a long way further down than she
had. That was one reason.</p>

<p>The papers on Sheriam&rsquo;s lap were duplicated on
Siuan&rsquo;s, and on the table in front of Egwene. Reports on
everything from the number of candles and sacks of beans remaining
in the camp to the state of the horses, and the same for Lord
Bryne&rsquo;s army. The army&rsquo;s camp encircled the Aes
Sedai&rsquo;s, with a ring perhaps twenty steps wide between, but in
many ways they might as well have been a mile apart. Surprisingly,
Lord Bryne insisted on that as much as the sisters. The Aes Sedai
did not want soldiers wandering among their tents, a lot of
unwashed, illiterate ruffians with light fingers often as not, and
it seemed the soldiers did not want Aes Sedai wandering among them
either&mdash;though, perhaps wisely, they held their reasons
close. They marched toward Tar Valon to pull down a usurper to the
Amyrlin Seat and raise Egwene in her place, yet few men were truly
comfortable around Aes Sedai. Few enough women, either.</p>

<p>As Keeper, Sheriam would have been all too happy to
take these minor matters out of Egwene&rsquo;s hands. She had said
as much, explaining how minor they were, how the Amyrlin Seat
should not be burdened with day-to-day trifles. Siuan, on the other
hand, said a good Amyrlin paid attention to just those, not trying
to duplicate the work of dozens of sisters and clerks, yet checking
on something different every day. That way she had a good idea of
what was happening and what needed doing before someone came
running to her with a crisis already breaking into shards. A feel
for how the wind was blowing, Siuan called it. Making sure these
reports reached her had required weeks, and Egwene was sure that
once she let them pass to Sheriam&rsquo;s control, she would never
again learn anything until it was long dealt with. If then.</p>

<p>A silence stretched as they began reading the next
paper in each stack.</p>

<p>They were not alone. Chesa, seated on cushions to one
side of the tent, spoke. &ldquo;Too little light is bad for the eyes,&rdquo;
she murmured almost to herself, holding up one of Egwene&rsquo;s
silk stockings that she was darning. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never catch me
ruining my eyes over words in this little light.&rdquo; Just short of
stout, with a twinkle in her eyes and a merry smile, Egwene&rsquo;s
maid was always trying to slip advice to the Amyrlin as though
talking about herself. She could have been in Egwene&rsquo;s service
twenty years instead of less than two months, and three times as
old as Egwene instead of barely twice. Tonight, Egwene suspected
that she talked to fill silences. There was a tension in the camp
since Logain had escaped. A man who could channel, shielded and
under close guard, yet he had slipped away like fog. Everyone
walked on edge wondering how, wondering where he was, what he
intended to do now. Egwene wished harder than most that she could
be sure she knew where Logain Ablar was.</p>

<p>Giving her papers a firm snap of her wrists, Sheriam
frowned at Chesa; she did not understand why Egwene let her maid be
present at these meetings, much less let her chatter away freely.
It probably never occurred to her that Chesa&rsquo;s presence and
her unexpected chatter frequently unsettled her just enough to help
Egwene sidestep advice she did not want to take and postpone
decisions she did not want to make, at least not the way Sheriam
wanted them made. Certainly the notion had never occurred to Chesa;
she smiled apologetically and returned to her darning, occasionally
murmuring to herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we continue, Mother,&rdquo; Sheriam said coolly, &ldquo;we
may finish before dawn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Staring at the next page, Egwene rubbed her temples.
Chesa might be right about the light. She had another headache
coming on. Then again, it might be the page, detailing what money
was left. The stories she had read never mentioned how much coin
was required to keep an army. Pinned to the sheet were notes from
two of the Sitters, Romanda and Lelaine, suggesting the soldiers be
paid less frequently, paid less in fact. More than suggesting,
really, just as Romanda and Lelaine were more than simply two
Sitters in the Hall. Other Sitters followed where they led, if not
all by any means, while the only Sitter Egwene could count on was
Delana, and her not far. It was rare that Lelaine and Romanda
agreed on anything, and they could hardly have chosen a worse. Some
of the soldiers had sworn oaths, yet most were there for their pay,
and maybe the hope of loot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The soldiers are to be paid as before,&rdquo; Egwene
muttered, crumpling the two notes. She was not going to let her
army melt away, any more than she would allow looting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you command, Mother.&rdquo; Sheriam&rsquo;s eyes
sparkled with pleasure. The difficulties must be clear to her&mdash;anyone who thought her less than very intelligent was in
deep trouble&mdash;but she did have a blind spot. If Romanda or
Lelaine said the sun was coming up, Sheriam most likely would claim
it was going down; she had had almost as much sway with the Hall as
they did now, perhaps more, until they put a halt to it between
them. The opposite was true, as well; those two would speak against
anything Sheriam wanted before they stopped to think. Which had its
uses, all in all.</p>

<p>Egwene&rsquo;s fingers tapped on the tabletop, but she
made them stop. The money had to be found&mdash;somewhere, somehow&mdash;but she did not have to let Sheriam see her worry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That new woman will work out,&rdquo; Chesa murmured over
her sewing. &ldquo;Tairens always carry their noses high, of course, but
Selame does know what&rsquo;s required of a lady&rsquo;s maid. Meri
and I will settle her down soon enough.&rdquo; Sheriam rolled her eyes
irritably.</p>

<p>Egwene smiled to herself. Egwene al&rsquo;Vere with
three maids waiting on her; as unbelievable as the stole itself.
But the smile lasted only a heartbeat. Maids had to be paid, too. A
tiny sum, balanced against thirty thousand soldiers, and the
Amyrlin could hardly do her own laundry or mend her own shifts, but
she could have managed splendidly with Chesa alone. And would have,
had she any choice in it. Less than a week earlier Romanda had
decided that the Amyrlin needed another servant and found Meri
among the refugees who huddled in every village until they were
chased away, and not to be outdone, Lelaine produced Selame from
the same source. The two women were crowded into Chesa&rsquo;s small
tent before Egwene knew either existed.</p>

<p>The principle of the thing was wrong: <em>three</em>
maids when there was not enough silver to pay the army halfway to
Tar Valon, servants chosen for her without any say; and then there
was the fact that she had yet another, if one who received not a
copper. Everyone believed Marigan was the Amyrlin&rsquo;s
maidservant, anyway.</p>

<p>Beneath the edge of the table she felt her belt
pouch, felt the bracelet inside. She should wear it more; it was a
duty. Keeping her hands low, she dug the bracelet out and slipped
it around her wrist, a band of silver made so the catch was
invisible once closed. Made with the One Power, the bracelet
snapped shut beneath the table, and she very nearly snatched it off
again.</p>

<p>Emotion flooded into a corner of her mind, emotion
and awareness, a little pocket, as if she were imagining it. Not
imagination, though; all too real. Half of an <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>,
the bracelet created a link between her and the woman who wore the
other half, a silver necklace the wearer could not remove herself.
They were a circle of two without embracing <em>saidar</em>, Egwene
always leading by virtue of the bracelet. &ldquo;Marigan&rdquo; was asleep now,
her feet sore from walking all day and days past, but even
sleeping, fear oozed though most strongly; only hate ever came near
fear in the stream that flowed through the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>.
Egwene&rsquo;s reluctance came from the constant gnawing of the
other woman&rsquo;s terror, from having worn the necklace end of an
<em>a&rsquo;dam</em> once, and from knowing the woman on the far
end. She hated sharing any part of her.</p>

<p>Only three women in the camp knew that Moghedien was
a prisoner, hidden in the midst of Aes Sedai. If it came out,
Moghedien would be tried, stilled and executed in short order. If
it came out, Egwene might not be far behind her, and Siuan and
Leane, as well. They were the other two who knew. At best she would
have the stole stripped away.</p>

<p><em>For hiding one of the Forsaken from justice</em>,
she thought grimly, <em>I&rsquo;ll be lucky if they just stick me
back with the Accepted</em>. Unconsciously she thumbed the golden
Great Serpent ring on the first finger of her right hand.</p>

<p>Then again, however just such a punishment might be,
it was unlikely. She had been taught that the wisest of the sisters
was chosen Amyrlin Seat, yet she had learned better. The choosing
of an Amyrlin was as hotly contested as electing a mayor in the Two
Rivers, and maybe more; no one bothered to stand against her father
in Emond&rsquo;s Field, but she had heard about elections in Deven
Ride and Taren Ferry. Siuan had only been raised Amyrlin because
the three before her each had died after just a few years on the
Amyrlin Seat. The Hall had wanted someone young. Speaking of age to
a sister was at least as rude as slapping her face, yet she had
begun to get some idea how long Aes Sedai lived. Rarely was anyone
chosen Sitter before she had worn the shawl seventy or eighty years
at least, and Amyrlins generally longer. Often <em>much</em>
longer. So when the Hall deadlocked between four sisters raised Aes
Sedai less than fifty years before, and Seaine Herimon of the White
suggested a woman who had worn the shawl only <em>ten</em> years,
it might have been as much exhaustion as Siuan&rsquo;s
qualifications in administration that brought the Sitters to stand
for her.</p>

<p>And Egwene al&rsquo;Vere, who in many eyes should
still have been a novice? A figurehead, easily directed, a <em>child</em> who had grown up in the same village with Rand
al&rsquo;Thor. That last definitely had its part in the decision.
They would not take back the stole, but she would find the little
authority she had managed to accumulate gone. Romanda, Lelaine and
Sheriam might actually come to blows over which would march her
about by the scruff of her neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That looks much like a bracelet I saw Elayne
wearing.&rdquo; The papers on Sheriam&rsquo;s lap crackled as she leaned
forward for a better look. &ldquo;And Nynaeve. They shared it, as I
recall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene gave a start. She had been careless. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same. A remembrance gift, when they left.&rdquo; Twisting
the silver circlet around her wrist, she felt a stab of guilt that
was all her own. The bracelet appeared segmented, but so cunningly
you could not see how exactly. She had hardly thought of Nynaeve
and Elayne since their departure for Ebou Dar. Perhaps she should
call them back. Their search was not going well, it seemed, though
they denied it. Still, if they could find what they were after&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sheriam was frowning, whether or not at the bracelet,
Egwene could not say. She could not allow Sheriam to start thinking
too much on that bracelet, though; if she ever noticed that the
necklace &ldquo;Marigan&rdquo; wore was a match, there might be painfully
awkward questions.</p>

<p>Rising, Egwene smoothed her skirt as she moved around
the table. Siuan had acquired several pieces of information today;
one could be put to good use now. She was not the only one with
secrets. Sheriam looked surprised when she stopped too close for
the other woman to stand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Daughter, I&rsquo;ve learned that a few days after
Siuan and Leane arrived in Salidar, ten sisters left, two from each
Ajah there except the Blue. Where did they go, and why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sheriam&rsquo;s eyes narrowed a fraction, but she wore
serenity as comfortably as her dress. &ldquo;Mother, I can hardly recall
every&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No dancing around, Sheriam.&rdquo; Egwene moved a little
closer, until their knees almost touched. &ldquo;No lies by omission. The
truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A frown creased Sheriam&rsquo;s smooth forehead. &ldquo;Mother, even if I knew, you cannot trouble yourself with every
little&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The truth, Sheriam. The whole truth. Must I ask
before the entire Hall why I cannot have the truth from my Keeper?
I will have it, daughter, one way or another. I <em>will</em> have
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sheriam&rsquo;s head swiveled as though she was
looking for a way to escape. Her eyes fell on Chesa, hunched over
her sewing, and she all but gasped with relief. &ldquo;Mother, tomorrow,
when we are alone, I am sure I can explain everything to your
satisfaction. I must speak with a few of the sisters first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they could work up what Sheriam was to tell her
tomorrow. &ldquo;Chesa,&rdquo; Egwene said, &ldquo;wait outside, please.&rdquo; For all
that she seemed focused on her work to the exclusion of everything
else, Chesa bounded to her feet in a flash and very nearly ran from
the tent. When Aes Sedai were at odds, anyone with half a brain
went elsewhere. &ldquo;Now, daughter,&rdquo; Egwene said. &ldquo;The truth. All that
you know. This is as private as you will be,&rdquo; she added when
Sheriam glanced at Siuan.</p>

<p>For a moment Sheriam adjusted her skirts, plucking at
them really, avoiding Egwene&rsquo;s eyes, no doubt still working
out evasions. But the Three Oaths trapped her. She could not speak
an untrue word, and whatever she thought of Egwene&rsquo;s true
position, slipping behind her back was a long way from denying her
authority to her face. Even Romanda maintained the proper
courtesies, if only by a hair at times.</p>

<p>Drawing a deep breath, Sheriam folded her hands in
her lap and spoke to Egwene&rsquo;s chest, matter-of-fact. &ldquo;When we
learned the Red Ajah was responsible for setting Logain up as a
false Dragon, we felt something had to be done.&rdquo; &lsquo;We&rsquo;
certainly meant the small coterie of sisters she had gathered
around her; Carlinya and Beonin and the rest held as much real sway
as most Sitters, if not actually in the Hall. &ldquo;Elaida was sending
out demands for every sister to return to the Tower, so we chose
ten sisters to do just that, by the fastest means they could
manage. They all should be there long since. Quietly making sure
that every sister in the Tower understands the truth of what the
Reds did with Logain. Not&mdash;&rdquo; She hesitated, then finished in
a rush. &ldquo;Not even the Hall knows of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene stepped away, rubbing her temples again.
Quietly making sure. In the hope that Elaida would be deposed. Not
exactly a bad scheme, really; it might even work, eventually. It
might take years, too. But then, for most sisters, the longer they
could go without truly <em>doing</em> anything, the better. With
enough time, they could convince the world that the White Tower had
never really broken. It had been broken before, even if only a
handful knew it. Maybe, with enough time, they could find a way to
adjust everything so it had not, really. &ldquo;Why keep it from the
Hall, Sheriam? Surely you don&rsquo;t think any of them would betray
your plan to Elaida.&rdquo; Half the sisters eyed the other half askance
for fear of Elaida&rsquo;s sympathizers. Partly for fear of
that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, a sister who decided that what we do is a
mistake would hardly let herself be chosen a Sitter. Any such would
have taken herself away long since.&rdquo; Sheriam had not relaxed, but
her voice took on the patient, instructing tone she seemed to think
had the greatest effect on Egwene. Usually, though, she was more
adroit at changing the subject. &ldquo;Those suspicions are the worst
problem we face for the time being. No one really trusts anyone. If
we could only see how to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Black Ajah,&rdquo; Siuan cut in quietly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what chills your blood like a silverpike up your skirts. Who can
say for sure who is Black, and who can say what a Black sister
might do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sheriam darted another hard look at Siuan, but after
a moment the force went out of her. Or rather, one sort of tension
replaced another. She glanced at Egwene, then nodded, reluctantly.
By the sour twist to her mouth, she would have made another evasion
had it not been plain Egwene would not stand for it. Most sisters
in the camp believed now, but after more than three thousand years
denying the Black Ajah&rsquo;s existence, it was a queasy belief.
Almost no one would open her mouth on that topic, no matter what
they believed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The question, Mother,&rdquo; Siuan went on, &ldquo;is what
happens when the Hall does find out.&rdquo; She seemed to be thinking
aloud again. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see any Sitter accepting the excuse that
she couldn&rsquo;t be told because she might be on Elaida&rsquo;s
side. And as for the possibility she might be Black Ajah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Yes,
I think they will be quite upset.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sheriam&rsquo;s face paled slightly. It was a wonder
she did not go dead white. &ldquo;Upset&rdquo; did not begin to cover it. Yes,
Sheriam would face <em>much</em> more than upset if this came
out.</p>

<p>Now was the time to drive home her advantage, but
another question occurred to Egwene. If Sheriam and her friends had
sent&mdash;what were they? Not spies. Ferrets, maybe, sent into
the walls after rats&mdash;if Sheriam had sent ferrets into the
White Tower, could&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?</p>

<p>A sudden stab of pain through that pocket of
sensations in the back of her head sent everything else flying. Had
she felt it directly, it would have been numbing. As it was, her
eyes bulged in shock. A man who could channel was touching the
necklace around Moghedien&rsquo;s neck; this was one link no man
could be brought into. Pain, and something unheard of from
Moghedien. Hope. And then it was all gone, the awareness, the
emotions. The necklace was off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;need some fresh air,&rdquo; she managed. Sheriam
started to rise, and Siuan, but she waved them back down. &ldquo;No, I
want to be alone,&rdquo; she said hastily. &ldquo;Siuan, find out everything
Sheriam knows about the ferrets. Light, I mean the ten sisters.&rdquo;
They both stared at her, but thank the Light, neither followed as
she snatched the lantern from its hook and hurried out.</p>

<p>It would not do for the Amyrlin to be seen running,
yet she came close, hoisting her divided skirts as well as she
could with her free hand and very nearly trotting. A cloudless sky
made the moonlight bright, dappling the tents and wagons with
shadows. Most people in the camp were asleep, but low fires still
burned here and there. A handful of Warders were about, a few
servants. Too many eyes to see if she ran. The last thing she
wanted was someone offering help. She realized she was panting, but
from alarm, not exertion.</p>

<p>Thrusting her head and the lantern into &ldquo;Marigan&rsquo;s&rdquo; tiny tent, she found it empty. The blankets that
made up the pallet on the ground lay in a sprawl, tossed aside by
someone in a hurry.</p>

<p><em>And what if she had still been here?</em> she
wondered. <em>With the necklace off, and maybe whoever freed
her?</em> Shivering, she withdrew slowly. Moghedien had good reason
to dislike her, very personally, and the only sister who could
match one of the Forsaken alone, when she could channel at all, was
in Ebou Dar. Moghedien could have killed Egwene without anyone
noticing; even had a sister felt her channel, there would be
nothing remarkable in that. Worse, Moghedien might not have killed
her. And no one would have known anything until they found the pair
of them gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; Chesa fussed behind her, &ldquo;you should not be
out in the night air. Night air is bad air. If you wanted Marigan,
I could have fetched her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene very nearly jumped. She had not been aware of
Chesa following her. She studied the people at the nearest fires.
They had gathered for companionship, not warmth in this unholy
heat, and they were not close, but maybe someone had seen who went
into &ldquo;Marigan&rsquo;s&rdquo; tent. She certainly had few visitors. And no
men among them. A man might well have been remarked. &ldquo;I think she
has run away, Chesa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that wicked woman!&rdquo; Chesa exclaimed. &ldquo;I always
said she had a mean mouth and a sneaking eye. Slinking away like a
thief after you took her in. She&rsquo;d be starving by a road, if
not for you. No gratitude at all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She followed all the way back to the tent where
Egwene slept, nattering on about wickedness in general, the
thanklessness of &ldquo;Marigan&rdquo; in particular, and how that sort should
be handled, which seemed to jump between switching them till they
settled down and tossing them out before they could run away,
tucked around cautions that Egwene check her jewelry to be sure it
was all still there.</p>

<p>Egwene barely heard. Her mind spun. It could not have
been Logain, could it? He could not have known about Moghedien,
much less come back to rescue her. Could he? Those men Rand was
gathering, those Asha&rsquo;man. Rumor in every village carried
whispers of Asha&rsquo;man and the Black Tower. Most of the sisters
tried to pretend they were unaffected by dozens of men who could
channel gathering in one spot&mdash;the worst of the tales had to
be inflated; rumor always exaggerated&mdash;but Egwene&rsquo;s toes
wanted to curl under with fright whenever she thought of them. An
Asha&rsquo;man could have&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;But why? How would he have known,
any more than Logain?</p>

<p>She was trying to avoid the only reasonable
conclusion. Something far worse than Logain come back, or even
Asha&rsquo;man. One of the Forsaken had freed Moghedien. Rahvin was
dead by Rand&rsquo;s hand, according to Nynaeve, and he had killed
Ishamael as well, or so it seemed. And Aginor and Balthamel.
Moiraine had killed Be&rsquo;lal. That left only Asmodean, Demandred
and Sammael among the men. Sammael was in Illian. No one knew where
the others were, or any of the women who survived. Moiraine had
done for Lanfear too, or they had done for each other, but all the
other women were still alive, so far as anyone knew. Forget the
women. It had been a man. Which? Plans had been laid long since in
case one of the Forsaken struck at the camp. No one sister here
could equal any of the Forsaken by herself, but linked in circles
was another matter, and any Forsaken who stepped into their camp
would find circles forming on every side of him. Or her. Once they
realized who she was. The Forsaken showed no signs of agelessness,
for some reason. Maybe it was some effect of being connected to the
Dark One. They&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This was dithering. She had to start thinking
clearly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chesa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;look like you need your head rubbed for the
ache again is what, is what you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Yes, Mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Find Siuan and Leane. Tell them to come to me. But
don&rsquo;t let anyone hear you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grinning, Chesa dropped a curtsy and scampered out.
She could hardly avoid knowing the currents that swirled around
Egwene, yet she found all the plotting and scheming fun. Not that
she knew more than surface, and little enough of that. Egwene did
not doubt her loyalty, but Chesa&rsquo;s opinion of what was
exciting might change if she learned the depth of those swirls.</p>

<p>Channeling the oil lamps inside the tent alight,
Egwene blew out the lantern and set it carefully in a corner. Maybe
she had to think clearly, but she still felt as if she was
stumbling in the dark.</p>
