<h4><em>The First Cup</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">I </span>do
not understand this,&rdquo; Elayne protested. She had
not been offered a chair; in fact, when she started to sit, she had
been told curtly to remain standing. Five sets of eyes were focused
on her, five women with set, grim faces. &ldquo;You are behaving as if
we&rsquo;ve done something <em>terrible</em> when what we have <em>done</em> is find the Bowl of the Winds!&rdquo; At least they were on the
brink of it, she hoped; the message Nalesean had come running back
with was none too clear. Mat had gone off shouting that he had
found it. Or something very like, Nalesean allowed; the longer he
talked, the more he bounced between absolute certainty and doubt.
Birgitte had remained watching Reanne&rsquo;s house; she seemed to
be sweaty and bored. In any case, matters were in motion. Elayne
wondered how Nynaeve was getting on. Better than herself, she
hoped. She had certainly never expected this when she revealed
their success.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have endangered a secret kept close by every
woman to wear the shawl for over two thousand years.&rdquo; Merilille sat
stiff-backed, serenity almost abandoned on the tight-lipped brink
of apoplexy. &ldquo;You must have been insane! Only madness could excuse
this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What secret?&rdquo; Elayne demanded.</p>

<p>Vandene, flanking Merilille with her sister, adjusted
pale green silk skirts irritably and said, &ldquo;Time enough for that
when you&rsquo;ve been properly raised, child. I thought you had
some sense.&rdquo; Adeleas, in a dark gray wool with deep brown trim,
nodded, mirroring Vandene&rsquo;s disapproval.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The child cannot be faulted for revealing a secret
she did not know,&rdquo; Careane Fransi said from Elayne&rsquo;s left,
shifting her bulk in her green-and-gilt armchair. She was not
stout, but almost, with shoulders as wide and arms as thick as most
men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tower law does not allow for excuses,&rdquo; Sareitha put
in quickly, in somewhat self-important tones, her normally
inquisitive brown eyes stern. &ldquo;Once mere excuses are allowed,
inevitably lesser and lesser excuses will become acceptable, until
law itself is gone.&rdquo; Her high-backed chair stood to the right. Only
she wore her shawl, but Merilille&rsquo;s sitting room had been
arranged as a court, though no one called it that. So far, no one
had. Merilille, Adeleas and Vandene confronted Elayne like judges,
Sareitha&rsquo;s chair was placed where the Seat of Rebuke would be,
and Careane&rsquo;s the Seat of Pardon, but the Domani Green who
would have been her defender nodded thoughtfully as the Tairen
Brown who would have been her prosecutor continued. &ldquo;She has
admitted guilt from her own mouth. I recommend that the child be
confined to the palace until we leave, with some good hard work to
occupy her mind and her hands. I also recommend a firm dose of the
slipper at regular intervals to remind her not to go behind
sisters&rsquo; backs. And the same for Nynaeve, as soon as she can
be found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne swallowed. Confined? Perhaps they did not need
to name this a trial for it to be one. Sareitha might not yet have
achieved the ageless face, but the weight of the other women&rsquo;s
years pressed at Elayne. Adeleas and Vandene with their hair nearly
all white, even their ageless faces echoing years. Merilille&rsquo;s
hair was glossy black, yet Elayne would not have been surprised to
learn she had worn the shawl as long or longer than most women not
Aes Sedai lived. For that matter, Careane might have, as well. Not
one of them approached her own strength in the Power, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;All
that experience as Aes Sedai, all that knowledge. All that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;authority. A heavy reminder that she was only eighteen and had been
in novice white a year ago.</p>

<p>Careane made no move to rebut Sareitha&rsquo;s
suggestions. Perhaps she best go on defending herself. &ldquo;Plainly
this secret you speak of has something to do with the Circle, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Kin are no concern of yours, child,&rdquo; Merilille
broke in sharply. Drawing a deep breath, she smoothed gold-slashed
skirts of silvery gray. &ldquo;I propose to pass sentence,&rdquo; she said in a
cold voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I concur, and defer to your decision,&rdquo; Adeleas said.
She gave Elayne a disappointed frown and shook her head.</p>

<p>Vandene waved her hand dismissively. &ldquo;I concur and
defer. But I agree with the Seat of Rebuke.&rdquo; Careane&rsquo;s look
might have contained a sliver of sympathy. Maybe a sliver.</p>

<p>Merilille opened her mouth.</p>

<p>The timid knock at the door sounded quite loud in the
momentary, thunderous silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What under the Light?&rdquo; Merilille muttered angrily. &ldquo;I told Pol not to let anyone disturb us. Careane?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not the youngest, but the lowest in strength, Careane
stood and glided to the door. Despite her heft, she always moved
like a swan.</p>

<p>It was Pol herself, Merilille&rsquo;s maid, who popped
in curtsying left and right. A slender, gray-haired woman usually
possessed of a dignity to rival that of her mistress, she wore an
anxious frown now, as well she might, barging in after
Merilille&rsquo;s instructions. Elayne had not been so glad to see
anyone since&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;since Mat Cauthon appeared in the Stone of Tear.
A horrendous thought. If Aviendha did not say she had met <em>toh</em> sufficiently soon, she might just see if asking the man to
beat her after all could end the agony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Queen brought this herself,&rdquo; Pol announced
breathily, proffering a letter sealed with a large red lump of wax. &ldquo;She said if I didn&rsquo;t give it to Elayne right away, she&rsquo;d
bring it in herself. She said it&rsquo;s about the child&rsquo;s
mother.&rdquo; Elayne almost ground her teeth. The sisters&rsquo; serving
women had all picked up their mistresses&rsquo; way of talking about
Nynaeve and her, if seldom where they could hear.</p>

<p>Furious, she snatched the letter without waiting for
Merilille to say she could&mdash;if that was what she would have
said&mdash;and broke the seal with her thumb.</p>

<p class="note">My Lady Elayne,</p>

<p class="note">I greet the Daughter-Heir of Andor with joyous news. I have but
just learned that your mother, Queen Morgase, lives and is at
present the guest of Pedron Niall in Amador, and wishes above all
to be reunited with you so that you may return to Andor together in
triumph. I offer escort through the bandits now infesting Altara,
so that you may reach your mother&rsquo;s side in safety and all
speed. Forgive these few poor words, scribbled in haste, but I know
you would wish to learn the wondrous news as soon as possible.
Until I can leave you at your mother&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p class="note_sig">Sealed in the Light,<br>
Jaichim Carridin</p>

<p>The paper crumpled in her fist. How <em>dare</em> he?
The pain of her mother&rsquo;s death, without even a body to be
buried, was only beginning to fade, and Carridin <em>dared</em>
mock her this way? Embracing the True Source, she hurled the foul
lies away from her and channeled; fire flared in midair, so hot
that only a dust of ash fell to the blue-and-gold floor tiles. <em>That</em> for Jaichim Carridin. And as for these&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;women! The
pride of a thousand years of Andoran queens put steel into her
backbone.</p>

<p>Merilille surged to her feet. &ldquo;You were not given
permission to channel! You will release the&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave us, Pol,&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;Now.&rdquo; The serving
woman stared, but Elayne&rsquo;s mother had taught her well the
voice of command, the voice of a Queen from her throne. Pol bobbed
a curtsy and was moving before she realized. Once under way, she
hesitated only an instant before hurrying out and closing the door
behind her. Whatever was about to happen plainly was for Aes Sedai
alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has gotten into you, child?&rdquo; Pure fury
submerged the remnants of Merilille&rsquo;s regathered calm. &ldquo;Release the Source immediately, or I vow, I&rsquo;ll fetch a
slipper myself this minute!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Aes Sedai.&rdquo; The words came out like winter
stone, and Elayne meant them to. Carridin&rsquo;s lies and these
women. Merilille threatened to <em>slipper</em> her? They <em>would</em> acknowledge her rightful place as a sister. She and
Nynaeve had found the Bowl! As good as, anyway, and the
arrangements for its use were under way. &ldquo;You propose to punish me
for endangering a secret apparently known only to sisters, but no
one bothered to tell me this secret when I attained the shawl. You
suggest punishing me like a novice or Accepted, but I am Aes Sedai.
I was raised to the shawl by Egwene al&rsquo;Vere, the Amyrlin you
claim to serve. If you deny that Nynaeve and I are Aes Sedai, then
you deny the Amyrlin Seat who sent me to find the Bowl of the
Winds, which we have done. I will not have it! I call you to
account, Merilille Ceandevin. Submit to the will of the Amyrlin
Seat, or <em>I</em> will call judgment on <em>you</em> as a
rebellious traitor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Merilille&rsquo;s eyes bulged, and her mouth hung
open, but she appeared composed beside Careane or Sareitha, who
looked about to choke to death on incredulity. Vandene seemed
mildly taken aback, a thoughtful finger pressed to her lips beneath
slightly widened eyes, while Adeleas sat forward, studying Elayne
as if seeing her for the first time.</p>

<p>Channeling, Elayne floated one of the tall armchairs
to her and sat, composing her skirts. &ldquo;You may as well sit, too,
Merilille.&rdquo; She still used the voice of command&mdash;apparently
it was the only way to make them listen&mdash;but she was startled
when Merilille actually sank back down slowly, staring at her
pop-eyed.</p>

<p>Outside, she maintained a calm, cool fa&ccedil;ade,
but inside, anger bubbled. No, it <em>boiled</em>. Secrets. She had
always thought Aes Sedai kept too many secrets, even from each
other. Especially from each other. True, she kept some herself, but
only at necessity, and not from anyone who needed to know. And
these women had thought to punish <em>her</em>! &ldquo;Your authority
comes from the Hall of the Tower, Merilille; Nynaeve&rsquo;s and
mine from the Amyrlin Seat. Ours supersedes yours. From now on, you
will take your instructions from Nynaeve or me. We will of course
listen carefully to any advice you might offer.&rdquo; She had thought
Merilille&rsquo;s eyes bulged before, but now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; the Gray spluttered. &ldquo;You are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Merilille!&rdquo; Elayne said sharply, leaning forward. &ldquo;Do you still deny the authority of your Amyrlin? Do you still <em>dare</em>?&rdquo; Merilille&rsquo;s mouth worked soundlessly. She wet her
lips. She shook her head jerkily. Elayne felt a thrill of
exultation; all that about Merilille taking direction was stuff and
nonsense, of course, but she <em>would</em> be acknowledged. Thom
and her mother both said you must begin by asking for ten to get
one. Still, that was not enough to damp her anger. She had half a
mind to fetch a slipper herself and see how far she could push
this. Except, that would shatter everything. They would remember
her age fast enough then, and how short a time ago she had put off
a novice dress; they might even begin thinking of her as a foolish
child again. Which thought stoked her fury anew. But she contented
herself with, &ldquo;While you think quietly on what else I should be
told as Aes Sedai, Merilille, Adeleas and Vandene will instruct me
in this secret I endangered. Do you mean to tell me the Tower has
known of the Circle&mdash;these Kin, as you call them&mdash;all
along?&rdquo; Poor Reanne and her hopes to avoid Aes Sedai notice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As near as they could make themselves come to
sisters, I suppose,&rdquo; Vandene replied. Carefully. She studied Elayne
as intently as her sister did, now. Though a Green, she had many of
the same mannerisms as Adeleas. Careane and Sareitha looked
stunned, disbelieving eyes swinging from a silent, red-cheeked
Merilille to Elayne and back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even during the Trolloc Wars, women failed their
tests, or lacked the strength, or were sent away from the Tower for
any of the usual reasons.&rdquo; Adeleas had adopted a lecturing tone,
but not offensively. Browns often did when expounding. &ldquo;Under the
circumstances, it is hardly surprising that a number feared to go
off into the world alone, nor that they might flee to Barashta, as
the city that existed here then was called. Though the main part of
Barashta was, of course, where the Rahad now stands. Not that a
stone of Barashta remains. The Trolloc Wars did not truly envelope
Eharon until late, but in the end, Barashta fell as completely as
Barsine, or Shaemal, or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Kin&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Vandene broke in gently; Adeleas
blinked at her, then nodded. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The Kin persisted even after
Barashta fell, in the same way they had before, taking in wilders
and women put out of the Tower.&rdquo; Elayne frowned; Mistress Anan had
said the Kin took in wilders, too, but Reanne&rsquo;s biggest
anxiety had seemed to be making her and Nynaeve prove they were
not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None ever remained long,&rdquo; Adeleas added. &ldquo;Five
years, perhaps ten; then, I suppose, as now. Once they realize that
their little group is no replacement for the White Tower, they go
off and become village Healers or Wisdoms or the like, or sometimes
simply forget the Power, stop channeling, and take up a craft or
trade. In any case, they vanish, so to speak.&rdquo; Elayne wondered how
anyone could forget the One Power that way; the urge to channel,
the temptation of the Source, was always there, once you learned
how. Aes Sedai did seem to believe some women could just put it
behind them, though, once they found out they would not be Aes
Sedai.</p>

<p>Vandene took up the explanation again; the sisters
frequently spoke almost in alternating sentences, each carrying on
smoothly where the other left off. &ldquo;The Tower has known of the Kin
from nearly the beginning, perhaps from the very beginning. At
first, no doubt, the Wars took precedence. And despite calling
themselves the <em>Kin</em>, they have done just what we want such
women to do. They remain hidden, even the fact that they can
channel, draw no attention whatsoever to themselves. Over the
years, they have even passed along word&mdash;secretly, of course;
carefully&mdash;when one of them found a woman falsely claiming
the shawl. You said something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne shook her head. &ldquo;Careane, is there any tea in
that pot?&rdquo; Careane gave a small start. &ldquo;I think Adeleas and Vandene
might like to wet their throats.&rdquo; The Domani woman did not quite
look at a still-staring Merilille before going to the table where
the silver teapot and cups were. &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t explain why,&rdquo;
Elayne went on. &ldquo;Why is knowledge of them such a deep secret? Why
haven&rsquo;t they been scattered long ago?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the runaways, of course.&rdquo; Adeleas made it sound
the most obvious thing in the world. &ldquo;It is a fact that other
gatherings have been broken up as soon as found&mdash;the last
about two hundred years ago&mdash;but the Kin do keep themselves
small, and quiet. That last group called themselves the Daughters
of Silence, yet they were hardly silent. Only twenty-three of them
altogether, wilders gathered and trained after a fashion by a pair
of former Accepted, but they&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Runaways,&rdquo; Elayne prompted, taking a cup from
Careane with a smile of thanks. She had not asked one for herself,
but she realized absently that the woman had offered her the first.
Vandene and her sister had talked quite a bit about runaways on the
way to Ebou Dar.</p>

<p>Adeleas blinked, and pulled herself back to the
topic. &ldquo;The Kin help runaways. They always have two or three women
in Tar Valon keeping watch. For one thing, they approach almost
every woman put out, in a very circumspect way, and for another,
they manage to find every runaway, whether novice or Accepted. At
least, none has made it off the island without their help since the
Trolloc Wars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; Vandene said as Adeleas paused to take a
cup from Careane. It had been offered to Merilille first, but
Merilille sat slumped and staring bleakly at nothing. &ldquo;If anyone
does manage to escape, why, we know right where to look, and she
nearly always ends up back in the Tower wishing her feet had never
itched. As long as the Kin don&rsquo;t know we know, anyway. Once
that happens, it will be back to the days before the Kin, when a
woman running from the Tower might go in any direction. The numbers
were larger then&mdash;Aes Sedai, Accepted, novices <em>and</em>
runaways&mdash;and some years two out of three escaped clean,
others three out of four. Using the Kin, we retake at least nine of
ten. You can see why the Tower has preserved the Kin and their
secret like precious jewels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne could. A woman was not done with the White
Tower until it was done with her. Besides, it could not hurt the
Tower&rsquo;s reputation for infallibility that it always caught
runaways. Almost always. Well, now she knew.</p>

<p>She stood, and to her astonishment, Adeleas did also,
and Vandene, waving away Careane&rsquo;s offered tea, and Sareitha.
Even Merilille, after a moment. They all looked at her expectantly,
even Merilille.</p>

<p>Vandene noticed her surprise, and smiled. &ldquo;Another
thing you might not know. We are a contentious lot in many ways, we
Aes Sedai, each jealous of her place and prerogatives, but when
someone is placed above us or stands above us, we tend to follow
her fairly meekly for the most part. However we might grumble about
her decisions in private.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, so we do,&rdquo; Adeleas murmured happily, as if she
had just discovered something.</p>

<p>Merilille took a deep breath, absorbing herself for a
moment in straightening her skirts. &ldquo;Vandene is right,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You stand above us in yourself, and I must admit, you apparently
have been placed above us. If our behavior calls for penance&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Well, you will tell us if it does. Where are we to follow you? If I
may ask?&rdquo; There was no sarcasm in any of that; if anything, her
tone was more polite than Elayne had heard out of her before.</p>

<p>She thought any Aes Sedai who ever lived would have
been proud to control her features as well as she did right then.
All she had wanted was for them to admit she really was Aes Sedai.
She fought a momentary urge to protest that she was too young, too
inexperienced. &ldquo;You can never put honey back in the comb,&rdquo; so Lini
used to say when she was a girl. Egwene was no older.</p>

<p>Drawing breath, she smiled warmly. &ldquo;The first thing
to recall is that we <em>are</em> all sisters, in every meaning of
the word. We must work together; the Bowl of the Winds is too
important for anything less.&rdquo; She hoped they would all nod so
enthusiastically when she told them what Egwene intended. &ldquo;Perhaps
we should sit again.&rdquo; They waited for her before folding themselves
back into their seats. She hoped Nynaeve was getting on a tenth so
well. When she found out about this, Nynaeve was going to faint
from shock. &ldquo;I have something of my own to tell you about the
Kin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fairly soon it was Merilille who looked ready to
faint from shock, and even Adeleas and Vandene were not far from
it. But they went right on saying, &ldquo;Yes, Elayne,&rdquo; and &ldquo;If you say
so, Elayne.&rdquo; Perhaps it would all go smoothly from now on.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The sedan chair was rocking through the crowds of
revelers along the quay when Moghedien spotted the woman. She was
being handed down from a coach at one of the boat landings by a
footman in green and white. A wide feathered mask covered her face
more completely than Moghedien&rsquo;s did, but she would have known
that determined stride, known that woman, from any angle in any
light. The carved screens that served as windows in the closed
chair were certainly no hindrance. Two fellows with swords on their
hips scrambled from the coach roof to follow the masked woman.</p>

<p>Moghedien thumped a fist against the side of the
chair, shouting, &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; The bearers halted so quickly she was
almost flung forward.</p>

<p>The crowd jostled past, some shouting curses at her
bearers for blocking the way, some shouting more good naturedly.
Down here by the river, the throng ran thin enough for her to watch
through the gaps. The boat that pulled away from the landing seemed
quite distinctive; the roof of the low cabin in the rear was
painted red; she did not see that affectation on any of the others
waiting at the long stone dock.</p>

<p>She wet her lips, shivering. Moridin&rsquo;s
instructions had been explicit, the price of disobedience made
excruciatingly clear. But a slight delay would not hurt. Not if he
never learned of it, anyway.</p>

<p>Flinging open the door, she climbed out into the
street and looked about hastily. There; that inn, right overlooking
the docks. And the river. Lifting her skirts, she hurried away
without the slightest fear anyone might take her chair; until she
untied the webs of Compulsion on them, the bearers would tell
anyone who asked that they were engaged, and stand there until they
died of hunger. A path opened ahead of her, men and women in
feathered masks leaping aside before she reached them, leaping with
squeals and cries as they clutched where they thought they had been
stabbed. As they had; there was no time to spin subtle webs on so
many minds, but a flurry of needles woven of Air did as well
here.</p>

<p>The stout innkeeper at The Oarsman&rsquo;s Pride
nearly leaped, too, at the sight of Moghedien striding into her
common room in gloriously scarlet silk worked with thread-of-gold
and black silk that glistened as richly as the gold. Her mask was a
great spray of pitch black feathers with a sharp black beak; a
raven. That was Moridin&rsquo;s joke, his command, as was the dress,
in fact. His colors were black and red, he said, and she would wear
them while she served him. She was in livery, however elegant, and
she could have killed everyone who saw her.</p>

<p>Instead, she spun a hasty web on the round-cheeked
innkeeper that jerked her up straight and made her eyes pop. No
time for subtlety. At Moghedien&rsquo;s command to show her the
roof, the woman <em>ran</em> up the railless stairs at the side of
the room. It was unlikely any of the feather-draped drinkers saw
anything unusual in the innkeeper&rsquo;s behavior, Moghedien
thought with a small laugh. The Oarsman&rsquo;s Pride probably had
never seen a patron of her quality before.</p>

<p>On the flat roof, she quickly weighed the dangers of
letting the innkeeper live versus those of killing her. Corpses had
a way of pointing a finger, eventually. If you wished to remain
quietly hidden in the shadows, you did not kill unless you
absolutely had to. Hastily, she adjusted the web of Compulsion,
told the woman to go down to her room, to go to sleep and forget
ever having seen her. With the haste, it was possible the innkeeper
might lose the whole day, or wake somewhat slower of wits than she
had been&mdash;so much in Moghedien&rsquo;s life would have been so
much easier had she possessed a better Talent for Compulsion&mdash;but in any case, the woman scurried away, eager to obey, and left
her alone.</p>

<p>As the door thumped down flat into the dusty
white-tiled roof, Moghedien gasped at the sudden feel of fingers
stroking her mind, palping her soul. Moridin did that sometimes; a
reminder, he said, as if she needed any more. She almost looked
around for him; her skin pebbled as though at a sudden icy breeze.
The touch vanished, and she shivered again. Coming or going, it did
remind her. Moridin himself could appear anywhere at any time.
Haste.</p>

<p>Speeding to the low wall that surrounded the roof,
she searched the river spread out below. Scores of boats of every
size swept along on their oars between larger vessels, anchored or
under sail. Most of the cabins of the sort she sought were plain
wood, but there she saw a yellow roof, and there a blue, and there,
in mid-river and heading southward fast&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;red. It had to be the
right one; she could not take any more time here.</p>

<p>She raised her hands, but as balefire launched
itself, something flashed around her and she jerked. Moridin <em>had</em> come; he <em>was</em> there, and he would&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She stared
at the pigeons fluttering away. Pigeons! She nearly spewed the
contents of her stomach across the roof. A glance at the river made
her snarl.</p>

<p>Because she had jerked, the balefire she meant to
slice through cabin and passenger instead had sliced diagonally
through the middle of the boat, about where the oarsmen had stood,
and the bodyguards. Because the rowers had been burned out of the
Pattern <em>before</em> the balefire struck, the two halves of the
craft were now a good hundred paces back up the river. Then again,
perhaps it was not a complete disaster. Because that slice from the
boat&rsquo;s center had gone at the same time the boatmen really
died, the river had had minutes to rush in. The two parts of the
boat sank out of sight in a great froth of bubbles even as her eyes
shifted to them, carrying their passenger to the depths.</p>

<p>Suddenly, what she had done struck her. She had
always moved in the dim places, always kept herself hidden, always&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Any woman in the city who could channel would know someone
had drawn a great deal of <em>saidar</em>, if not for what, and any
eye watching had seen that bar of liquid white fire sear across the
afternoon. Fear gave her wings. Not fear. Terror.</p>

<p>Gathering her skirts, she ran back down the stairs,
ran through the common room bumping into tables and careering off
people trying to get out her way, ran into the street too
frightened to think, battering a path through the crowd with her
hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run!&rdquo; she shrieked, hurling herself into the sedan
chair. Her skirts caught in the door; she ripped them free. &ldquo;Run!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bearers flung themselves into motion, tossing her
about, but she did not care. She braced herself with fingers laced
through the carved window screens, and shook uncontrollably. He had
not forbidden this. He might forgive, or even ignore her
independent action here, if she carried out his instructions
swiftly, efficiently. That was her only hope. She was going to make
Falion and Ispan <em>crawl</em>!</p>
