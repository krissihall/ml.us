was ready as Rand had ordered in the courtyard at
the front of the Sun Palace. Or almost all. The morning sun slanted
shadows from the stepped towers, so only ten paces in front of the
tall bronze gates lay in full light. Dashiva and Flinn and
Narishma, the three Asha&rsquo;man he had retained, waited beside
their horses, even Dashiva resplendent with the silver sword and
red-and-gold Dragon on his black collar, though he still touched
the sword at his hip as if constantly surprised to find it there. A
hundred of Dobraine&rsquo;s armsmen sat their mounts behind Dobraine
himself with two long banners that hung down in the still air,
their dark armor newly lacquered so it glistened in the sun, and
silk streamers of red and white and black tied below the heads of
their lances. They raised a cheer when Rand appeared, his sword
belt with its gilded Dragon buckle strapped over a red coat heavy
with gold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Al&rsquo;Thor! Al&rsquo;Thor! Al&rsquo;Thor!&rdquo; filled
the courtyard. People crowding the archers&rsquo; balconies joined
in, Tairen and Cairhienin in their silks and laces who just a week
before had no doubt cheered Colavaere as loudly. Men and women who
would as soon he had never returned to Cairhien, some of them,
waving their arms and giving voice. He raised the Dragon Scepter to
acknowledge them, and they roared louder.</p>

<p>A thunderous roll of drums and a blare of trumpets
rose through the cheers, produced by a dozen more of
Dobraine&rsquo;s men who wore crimson tabards with the
black-and-white disc on the chest, half carrying long trumpets
draped in identical cloths, the other half with kettle drums also
decorated slung on either side of the horses.</p>

<p>Five Aes Sedai in their shawls came to meet him as he
descended the broad stairs. At least, they glided toward him.
Alanna gave him one searching look with those big dark penetrating
eyes; the tiny knot of emotions in his skull said she was calmer,
more relaxed, than he ever remembered. Then she made a small
motion, and Min touched his arm and went aside with her. Bera and
the others made small curtsies, inclining their heads slightly, as
Aiel streamed out of the palace behind him. Nandera led two hundred
Maidens&mdash;they were not about to be outshone by the &ldquo;oathbreakers&rdquo;&mdash;and Camar, a rangy Bent Peak Daryne grayer
than Nandera and half a head taller than Rand, led two hundred
<em>Seia Doon</em> who would not be outshone by <em>Far Dareis
Mai</em>, let alone Cairhienin. They swung past on either side of
him and the Aes Sedai to ring the courtyard. Bera like a proud
farmwife and Alanna like some darkly beautiful queen, in their
green-fringed shawls, and plump Rafela, even darker wrapped in her
blue, watching him anxiously, and cool-eyed Faeldrin, yet another
Green, her thin braids worked with colored beads, and slim Merana
in her gray, whose frown made Rafela seem a picture of Aes Sedai
serenity. Five.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are Kiruna and Verin?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;I called
for all of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you did, my Lord Dragon,&rdquo; Bera answered smoothly.
She made another curtsy, too; only the slightest dip, but it took
him aback. &ldquo;We could not find Verin; she is somewhere in the Aiel
tents. Questioning the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Her smooth tone faltered for one
instant. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the prisoners, I believe, in an attempt to learn
what was planned once they reached Tar Valon.&rdquo; Once he reached Tar
Valon; she knew enough not to blurt that where anyone could hear. &ldquo;And Kiruna is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;consulting with Sorilea on a matter of
protocol. But I&rsquo;m quite certain she will be more than happy to
join us if you send a personal summons to Sorilea. I could go
myself, if you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He waved that away. Five should be enough. Perhaps
Verin could learn something. Did he want to know? And Kiruna. A
matter of <em>protocol</em>? &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you are getting on with
the Wise Ones.&rdquo; Bera started to speak, then closed her mouth
firmly. Whatever Alanna was saying to Min, scarlet spots had flared
in Min&rsquo;s cheeks and she had raised her chin, though oddly, she
seemed to be replying calmly enough. He wondered whether she would
tell him. One thing he was sure of about women was that every last
one had secret places in her heart, sometimes shared with another
woman but never with a man. The only thing he was sure of about
women.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t come out here to stand all day,&rdquo; he
said irritably. The Aes Sedai had arranged themselves with Bera in
the lead, the others half a step back. If it had not been her, it
would have been Kiruna. Their own arrangements, not his. He did not
really care so long as they held to their oaths, and he might have
left it alone if not for Min and Alanna. &ldquo;Merana will speak for you
from now on; you will take your orders from her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the suddenly widened eyes, you would have thought
he had slapped every one of them. Including Merana. Even
Alanna&rsquo;s head whipped around. Why should they be startled?
True, Bera or Kiruna had done almost all the talking since
Dumai&rsquo;s Wells, but Merana had been the ambassador sent to him
at Caemlyn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are ready, Min?&rdquo; he said, and without waiting
for a reply strode out into the courtyard. The big, fiery-eyed
black gelding he had ridden back from Dumai&rsquo;s Wells had been
brought out for him, with a high-cantled saddle all worked in gold
and a crimson saddlecloth embroidered with the disc of
black-and-white at each corner. The trappings suited the animal,
and his name. Tai&rsquo;daishar; in the Old Tongue, Lord of Glory.
Horse and trappings both suited the Dragon Reborn.</p>

<p>As he mounted, Min led up the mouse-colored mare she
had ridden back, snugging on her riding gloves before swinging into
the saddle. &ldquo;Seiera&rsquo;s a fine animal,&rdquo; she said, patting the
mare&rsquo;s arched neck. &ldquo;I wish she was mine. I like her name,
too. We call the flower a blue-eye around Baerlon, and they grow
everywhere in the spring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s yours,&rdquo; Rand said. Whichever Aes Sedai
the mare belonged to would not refuse to sell to him. He would give
Kiruna a thousand crowns for Tai&rsquo;daishar; she could not
complain then; the finest stallion of Tairen bloodstock never cost
a tenth of that. &ldquo;Did you have an interesting conversation with
Alanna?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing that would interest you,&rdquo; she said
offhandedly. But a faint touch of red stained her cheeks.</p>

<p>He snorted softly, then raised his voice. &ldquo;Lord
Dobraine, I&rsquo;ve kept the Sea Folk waiting long enough, I
think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The procession drew crowds along the broad avenues
and filled the windows and rooftops as word raced ahead. Twenty of
Dobraine&rsquo;s lancers led, to clear the way, along with thirty
Maidens and as many Black Eyes, then drummers, booming away&mdash;<em>droom, droom, droom, DROOM-DROOM</em>&mdash;and the trumpeters
punctuating that with nourishes. Shouts from the onlookers nearly
drowned drums and trumpets alike, a wordless roar that could have
been rage as easily as approbation. The banners streamed out, just
ahead of Dobraine and behind Rand, the white Dragon Banner and the
scarlet Banner of the Light, and veiled Aiel trotted alongside the
lancers, whose streamers also floated in the air. Now and then a
few flowers were hurled at him. Maybe they did not hate him. Maybe
they only feared. It had to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A train worthy of any king,&rdquo; Merana said loudly, to
be heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s enough for the Dragon Reborn,&rdquo; he
replied sharply, &ldquo;Will you stay back? And you, too, Min.&rdquo; Other
rooftops had held assassins. The arrow or crossbow bolt meant for
him would not find its target in a woman today.</p>

<p>They did fall behind his big black, for all of three
paces, and then they were right beside him again, Min telling him
what Berelain had written about the Sea Folk on the ships, about
the Jendai Prophecy and the Coramoor, and Merana adding what she
knew of the prophecy, though she admitted that was not very much,
little more than Min.</p>

<p>Watching the rooftops, he listened with half an ear.
He did not hold <em>saidin</em>, but he could feel it in Dashiva
and the other two, right behind him. He did not feel the tingle
that would announce the Aes Sedai embracing the Source, but he had
told them not to, without permission. Perhaps he should change
that. They did seem to be keeping their oath. How could they not?
They were Aes Sedai. A fine thing if he took an assassin&rsquo;s
blade while one of the sisters tried to decide whether serving
meant saving him or obeying meant not channeling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you laughing?&rdquo; Min wanted to know. Seiera
pranced closer, and she smiled up at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is no laughing matter, my Lord Dragon,&rdquo; Merana
said acidly on the other side. &ldquo;The Atha&rsquo;an Miere can be very
particular. Any people grow fastidious when it comes to their
prophecies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The world is a laughing matter,&rdquo; he told her. Min
laughed along with him, but Merana sniffed and went right back to
the Sea Folk as soon as he stopped.</p>

<p>At the river, the high city walls ran out into the
water, flanking long gray stone docks that stretched out from the
quay. Riverships and boats and barges of every kind and size were
tied everywhere, the crews on deck to see the commotion, but the
vessel Rand sought stood ready and waiting, lashed end-on to the
end of a dock where all the laborers had already been cleared off.
A longboat, it was called, a low narrow splinter without any masts,
just one staff in the bow, four paces tall, topped by a lantern,
and another at the stern. Nearly thirty paces in length and lined
with as many long oars, it could not carry the cargo a sailing
vessel the same size would, but it had no need of the wind, either,
and with a shallow draft, it could travel day and night, using
rowers in shifts. Longboats ran the rivers with cargoes of
importance and urgency. It had seemed appropriate.</p>

<p>The captain bowed repeatedly as Rand came down the
boarding ramp with Min on his arm and the Aes Sedai and
Asha&rsquo;man at his heels. Elver Shaene was even skinnier than his
craft in a yellow coat of Murandian cut that hung to his knees. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an honor to be carrying you, my Lord Dragon,&rdquo; he
murmured, mopping his bald head with a large handkerchief. &ldquo;An
honor, it is. An honor, indeed. An honor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Plainly the man would rather have had his ship brim
full of live vipers. He blinked at the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s shawls and
stared at their ageless faces and licked his lips, eyes flickering
back to Rand uneasily. The Asha&rsquo;man dropped his mouth open
once he put their black coats together with rumor, and thereafter
he avoided so much as a glance in their direction. Shaene watched
Dobraine lead the men with the banners aboard, and the trumpeters,
and the drummers lugging their drums, then eyed the horsemen lining
the dock as if he suspected they might want to board, too. Nandera,
with twenty Maidens, and Camar with twenty Black Eyes, all with
<em>shoufa</em> wrapped around their heads though unveiled, made
the captain step hastily to put the Aes Sedai between him and them.
The Aiel wore scowls, for the heartbeat that needing to veil might
slow them, but the Sea Folk might well know what a veil meant, and
it would hardly do for them to think they were under attack. Rand
thought Shaene&rsquo;s handkerchief might yet rub away what thin
gray fringe of hair he had left.</p>

<p>The longboat swept away from the dock on its long
oars, the two banners rippling in the bows, and the drums pounding,
and the trumpets blaring. Out in the river, people appeared on the
decks of ships to watch, even climbed into the rigging. On the Sea
Folk ship they came out, too, many in bright colors unlike the drab
clothing on crews of the other vessels. The <em>White Spray</em>
was a larger craft than most of the rest, yet somehow sleeker as
well, with two tall masts raked back sharply and spars laid across
them squarely where nearly all the other ships had slanting spars
longer than the masts to hold most of their sails. Everything about
it spoke of difference, but in one thing, Rand knew, the
Atha&rsquo;an Miere had to be like everyone else. They could either
agree to follow him on their own or be forced to it; the Prophecies
said he would bind together the people of every land&mdash;&ldquo;The
north shall he tie to the east, and the west shall be bound to the
south,&rdquo; it said&mdash;and no one could be allowed to stand aside.
He knew that, now.</p>

<p>Sending out orders from his bath, he had not had an
opportunity to give details of what he intended on reaching
<em>White Spray</em>, so he announced them now. The details
produced grins among the Asha&rsquo;man, as expected&mdash;well,
Finn and Narishma grinned; Dashiva blinked absently&mdash;and
frowns among the Aiel, also as expected. They did not like being
left behind. Dobraine merely nodded; he knew he was only here for
show today. What Rand did not expect was the Aes Sedai
reaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It shall be as you command, my Lord Dragon,&rdquo; Merana
said, making one of those small curtsies. The other four exchanged
glances, but they were curtsying and murmuring &ldquo;as you command&rdquo;
right behind her. Not one protest, not one frown, not a single
haughty stare or recital of why it should be done any way but what
he wanted. Could he begin to trust them? Or would they find some
Aes Sedai way to wriggle around their oath as soon as his back was
turned?</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will keep their word,&rdquo; Min murmured abruptly,
just as if she had read his thoughts. With an arm wrapped around
his and both hands holding his sleeve, she kept her voice for his
ears alone. &ldquo;I just saw these five in your hand,&rdquo; she added in case
he did not understand. He was not sure he could fix his mind around
that, even if she had seen it in a viewing.</p>

<p>He did not have long to try. The longboat flew
through the water, and in no time at all was backing oars some
twenty paces from the much taller <em>White Spray</em>. Drums and
trumpets fell silent, and Rand channeled, making a bridge of Air
laced with Fire that connected the longboat&rsquo;s railing to that
of the Sea Folk ship. With Min on his arm, he started across, to
every eye but that of an Asha&rsquo;man walking upward on
nothing.</p>

<p>He half expected Min to falter, at least at first,
but she simply walked at his side as though there were stone
beneath her green-heeled boots.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I trust you,&rdquo; she said quietly. She smiled, too,
partly a comforting smile, and partly, he thought, because she was
amused at reading his mind once more.</p>

<p>He wondered how much she would trust if she knew that
this was as far as he could weave a bridge like this. One pace
farther, one foot, and the whole thing would have given way at the
first step. At that point it became like trying to lift yourself
with the Power, an impossibility; even the Forsaken did not know
why, any more than they knew why a woman could make a longer
bridge than a man even if she was not as strong. It was not a
matter of weight; any amount of weight could cross any bridge.</p>

<p>Just short of <em>White Spray</em>&rsquo;s railing he
stopped, standing in midair. For all Merana&rsquo;s descriptions,
the people staring back at him were a shock. Dark women and
bare-chested men with colorful sashes that dangled to the knee, and
gold or silver chains around their necks and rings in their ears,
in their noses of all places on some of the women, who wore a
rainbow of blouses above their dark, baggy breeches. None had any
more expression than an Aes Sedai who was trying hard. Four of the
women, despite being barefoot like the rest, wore bright silks, two
of them brocades, and they had more necklaces and earrings than
anyone else as well, with a chain strung with gold medallions
running from an earring to a ring in the side of the nose. They
said nothing, only stood together watching him, sniffing at small,
lacy golden boxes that hung from chains around their necks. He
addressed himself to them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the Dragon Reborn. I am the Coramoor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A collective sigh ran through the crew. Not among the
four women, though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Harine din Togara Two Winds, Wavemistress to
Clan Shodein,&rdquo; announced the one with the most earrings, a
handsome, full-mouthed woman in red brocade wearing five fat little
gold rings in each ear. There were white streaks through her
straight black hair, and fine lines at the corners of her eyes. She
had an impressive dignity. &ldquo;I speak here for the Mistress of the
Ships. If it pleases the Light, the Coramoor may come aboard.&rdquo; For
some reason she gave a start, and so did the three with her, but
that sounded entirely too much like permission. Rand stepped onto
the deck with Min wishing he had not waited.</p>

<p>He let the bridge go, and <em>saidin</em>, but
immediately felt another bridge replace it. In short order the
Asha&rsquo;man and the Aes Sedai were with him, the sisters no more
flustered than Min had been, though perhaps one or two did
straighten her skirts a bit more than necessary. They were still
not so easy around the Asha&rsquo;man as they pretended.</p>

<p>The four Sea Folk women took one look at the Aes
Sedai and immediately gathered in a close huddle, whispering.
Harine did a lot of the talking, and so did a young, pretty woman
in green brocade with eight earrings altogether, but the pair in
plain silk put in occasional comments.</p>

<p>Merana coughed delicately, and spoke softly into the
hand she used to cover it. &ldquo;I heard her name you the Coramoor. The
Atha&rsquo;an Miere are great bargainers, I&rsquo;ve heard, but I
think she gave away something, then.&rdquo; Nodding, Rand glanced down at
Min. She was squinting at the Sea Folk women, but as soon as she
noticed his look, she shook her head ruefully; she saw nothing yet
that might help him.</p>

<p>Harine turned so calmly there might never have been
any hasty conference. &ldquo;This is Shalon din Togara Morning Tide,
Windfinder to Clan Shodein,&rdquo; she said with a small bow toward the
woman in green brocade, &ldquo;and this is Derah din Selaan Rising Wave,
Sailmistress of <em>White Spray</em>.&rdquo; Each woman bowed slightly as
she was named, and touched fingers to her lips.</p>

<p>Derah, a handsome woman a little short of her middle
years, wore plain blue and also eight earrings, though her
earrings, nose ring, and the chain that ran between was finer than
Harine&rsquo;s or Shalon&rsquo;s. &ldquo;The welcome of my ship to you,&rdquo;
Derah said, &ldquo;and the grace of the Light be upon you until you leave
his decks.&rdquo; She made a small bow toward the fourth woman, in
yellow. &ldquo;This is Taval din Chanai Nine Gulls, Windfinder of
<em>White Spray</em>.&rdquo; Only three rings hung from each of
Taval&rsquo;s ears, fine like those of the Sailmistress. She looked
younger than Shalon, no older than himself.</p>

<p>Harine took it up again, gesturing toward the raised
stern of the ship. &ldquo;We will speak in my cabin, if it pleases you. A
soarer is not a large vessel, Rand al&rsquo;Thor, and the cabin is
small. If it pleases you to come alone, all here stand surety for
your safety.&rdquo; So. From the Coramoor to plain Rand al&rsquo;Thor. She
would take back what she had given, if she could.</p>

<p>He was about to open his mouth and agree&mdash;anything to get this done; Harine was already moving that way,
still gesturing for him to follow, the other women with her&mdash;when Merana gave another tiny cough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Windfinders can channel,&rdquo; she murmured hastily
into her hand. &ldquo;You should take two sisters with you, or
they&rsquo;ll feel they&rsquo;ve gained the upper hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand frowned. The upper hand? He <em>was</em> the
Dragon Reborn, after all. Still&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;I will be pleased to come,
Wavemistress, but Min here goes everywhere with me.&rdquo; He patted
Min&rsquo;s hand on his arm&mdash;she had not let go an instant&mdash;and Harine nodded. Taval was already holding the door open;
Derah made one of those small bows, gesturing him toward it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Dashiva, of course.&rdquo; The man gave a start at his
name, as if he had been asleep. At least he was not staring
wide-eyed around the deck like Flinn and Narishma. Staring at the
women. Stories spoke of the alluring beauty and grace of Sea Folk
women, and Rand could certainly see that&mdash;they walked as if
they would begin dancing on the next step, swaying sinuously&mdash;but he had not brought the men here to ogle. &ldquo;Keep your eyes open!&rdquo;
he told them harshly. Narishma colored, jerking himself stiffly
erect, and pressed fist to chest. Flinn simply saluted, but both
seemed more alert. For some reason, Min looked up at him with the
tiniest wry smile.</p>

<p>Harine nodded a little more impatiently. A man
stepped out from the crew, in baggy green silk breeches and with an
ivory-hilted sword and dagger thrust behind his sash. More
white-haired than she, he also wore five fat little rings in each
ear. She waved him away even more impatiently. &ldquo;As it please you,
Rand al&rsquo;Thor,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And of course,&rdquo; Rand added, as though an
afterthought, &ldquo;I must have Merana, and Rafela.&rdquo; He was not certain
why he chose the second name&mdash;perhaps because the plump
Tairen sister was the only one not Green except Merana&mdash;but
to his surprise, Merana smiled in approval. For that matter, Bera
nodded, and so did Faeldrin, and Alanna.</p>

<p>Harine did not approve. Her mouth tightened before
she could control it. &ldquo;As it please you,&rdquo; she said, not quite so
pleasantly as before.</p>

<p>Once he was inside the stern cabin, where everything
except a few brass-bound chests seemed built into the walls, Rand
was not so sure the woman had not gained whatever she wanted just
bringing him there. For one thing, he was forced to stand hunched
over, even between the roof beams, or whatever they were called on
a ship. He had read several books about ships, but none mentioned
that. The chair he was offered at the foot of the narrow table
would not pull out, being fastened to the deck, and once Min showed
him how to unlatch the chair arm and swing it out so he could sit,
his knees hit the bottom of the table. There were only eight
chairs. Harine sat at the far end, her back to the stern&rsquo;s
red-shuttered windows, with her Windfinder to her left and the
Sailmistress to her right and Taval below her. Merana and Rafela
took the chairs below Shalon, while Min sat to Rand&rsquo;s left.
Dashiva, with no chair, took a place beside the door, standing
upright quite easily, though the roof beams almost brushed his
head, too. A young woman in a bright blue blouse, with one thin
earring in each ear, brought thick cups of tea, brewed black and
bitter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be done with this,&rdquo; Rand said testily as
soon as the woman left with her tray. He left his cup on the table
after one sip. He could not stretch out his legs. He hated being
confined. Thoughts of being doubled inside the chest flashed in his
head, and it was all he could do to rein his temper. &ldquo;The Stone of
Tear has fallen, the Aiel have come over the Dragonwall, all the
parts of your Jendai Prophecy have come to pass. I am the
Coramoor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harine smiled across her cup, a cool smile with no
amusement in it. &ldquo;That may be so, as it pleases the Light, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It <em>is</em> so,&rdquo; Rand snapped despite a warning
glance from Merana. She went so far to nudge his leg with her foot.
He ignored that, too. The cabin walls seemed closer, somehow. &ldquo;What
is it that you don&rsquo;t believe, Wavemistress? That Aes Sedai
serve me? Rafela, Merana.&rdquo; He gestured sharply.</p>

<p>All he wanted was for them to come to him and be seen
to come, but they set down their cups and rose gracefully, glided
to either side of him&mdash;and knelt. Each took one of his hands
in both of hers and pressed her lips to the back of it, right on
the shining golden-maned head of the Dragon that wound around his
forearm. He just managed to conceal his shock, not taking his eyes
from Harine. Her face went a little gray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aes Sedai serve me, and so will the Sea Folk.&rdquo; He
motioned the sisters back to their seats. Oddly, they looked a
touch surprised. &ldquo;That is what the Jendai Prophecy says. The Sea
Folk will serve the Coramoor. I <em>am</em> the Coramoor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but there is the matter of the Bargain.&rdquo; That
word was plainly capitalized in Harine&rsquo;s tone. &ldquo;The Jendai
Prophecy says you will bring us to glory, and all the seas of the
world will be ours. As we give to you, you must give to us. If I do
not make the Bargain well, Nesta will hang me naked in the rigging
by my ankles and call the First Twelve of Clan Shodein to name a
new Wavemistress.&rdquo; A look of utter horror stole across her face as
those words came out of her mouth, and her black eyes went wider
and wider by the word with disbelief. Her Windfinder goggled at
her, and Derah and Taval tried so hard not to, their eyes fastened
to the table, that it seemed their faces might break.</p>

<p>And suddenly, Rand understood.
<em>Ta&rsquo;veren</em>. He had seen the effects, the sudden moments
when the least likely thing happened because he was near, but he
had never known what was going on before until it was finished.
Easing his legs as best he could, he leaned his arms on the table. &ldquo;The Atha&rsquo;an Miere will serve me, Harine. That is given.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we will serve you, but&mdash;&rdquo; Harine
half-reared out her chair, spilling her tea. &ldquo;What are you doing to
me, Aes Sedai?&rdquo; she cried, trembling. &ldquo;This is not fair
bargaining!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do nothing,&rdquo; Merana said calmly. She actually
managed to drink a swallow of that tea without wincing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are in the presence of the Dragon Reborn,&rdquo;
Rafela added. &ldquo;The Coramoor your prophecy calls you to serve, as I
believe.&rdquo; She laid a finger to one round cheek. &ldquo;You said you speak
for the Mistress of the Ships. Does that mean your word is binding
on the Atha&rsquo;an Miere?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Harine whispered hoarsely, falling back in her
seat. &ldquo;What I say binds every ship, and all to the Mistress of the
Ships herself.&rdquo; It was impossible for one of the Sea Folk to go
white in the face, yet staring at Rand, she came as near as she
could.</p>

<p>He smiled at Min, to share the moment. At last a
people would come to him without fighting every step of the way, or
splitting apart like the Aiel. Maybe Min thought he wanted her help
to clinch matters, or maybe it was <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>. She
leaned toward the Wavemistress. &ldquo;You will be punished for what
happens here today, Harine, but not so much as you fear, I think.
At least, one day you will be the Mistress of the Ships.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harine frowned at her, then glanced to her
Windfinder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is not Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Shalon said, and Harine
seemed caught between relief and disappointment. Until Rafela
spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Several years ago, I heard reports of a girl with a
remarkable ability to see things. Are you she, Min?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min grimaced into her cup, then nodded reluctantly;
she always said that the more people knew what she could do, the
less good came of it. Glancing across the table at the Aes Sedai,
she sighed. Rafela only nodded, but Merana was staring at her,
hazel eyes avid in a mask of serenity. No doubt she expected to
corner Min as soon as possible and find out what this talent was
and how it worked, and no doubt Min expected it too. Rand felt a
prickle of irritation; she should have known he would protect her
from being bothered. A prickle of irritation, and a warmth that he
could protect her from that, at least.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may trust what Min says, Harine,&rdquo; Rafela said. &ldquo;The reports I heard say that what she sees always seems to come
true. And even if she does not realize it, she has seen something
else.&rdquo; Her round face tilted to one side, and a smile curved her
mouth. &ldquo;If you will be punished for what happens here, then it must
mean you will agree to whatever your Coramoor wants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unless I agree to nothing,&rdquo; Harine blustered. &ldquo;If I
make no Bargain&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Her fists clenched on the tabletop. She had
already admitted she had to make the Bargain. She had admitted the
Sea Folk would serve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I require of you is not onerous,&rdquo; Rand said. He
had thought about this since deciding to come. &ldquo;When I want ships
to carry men or supplies, the Sea Folk will give them. I want to
know what is happening in Tarabon and Arad Doman, and in the lands
between. Your ships can learn&mdash;will learn&mdash;what I want
to know; they call in Tanchico and Bandar Eban and a hundred
fishing villages and towns between. Your ships can travel farther
out to sea than anyone else&rsquo;s. The Sea Folk will keep watch as
far west in the Aryth Ocean as they can sail. There is a people,
the Seanchan, who live beyond the Aryth Ocean, and one day, they
will come to try to conquer us. The Sea Folk will let me know when
they come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You require much,&rdquo; Harine muttered bitterly. &ldquo;We
know of these Seanchan, who come from the Islands of the Dead, it
seems, from which no ship returns. Some of our ships have
encountered theirs; they use the One Power as a weapon. You require
more than you know, Coramoor.&rdquo; For once, she did not pause at the
title. &ldquo;Some dark evil has descended upon the Aryth Ocean. No ship
of ours has come from there in many months. Ships that sail west,
vanish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand felt a chill. He turned the Dragon Scepter, made
from part of a Seanchan spear, in his hands. Could they have
returned already? They had been driven back once, at Falme. He
carried the spearhead to remind him that there were more enemies in
the world than those he could see, but he had been sure it would
take the Seanchan years to recover from their defeat, driven into
the sea by the Dragon Reborn and the dead heroes called back by the
Horn of Valere. Was the Horn still in the White Tower? He knew it
had been taken there.</p>

<p>Suddenly he could not bear the confines of the cabin
any longer. He fumbled with the latch on the chair arm. It would
not open. Gripping the smooth wood, he tore the arm off in
splinters with one convulsive heave. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve agreed the Sea
Folk will serve me,&rdquo; he said, pushing himself up. The low ceiling
made him hunch over the table threateningly. The cabin did feel
smaller. &ldquo;If there is any more to your Bargain, Merana and Rafela
here will see to it with you.&rdquo; Without waiting for an answer, he
spun for the door, where Dashiva appeared to be muttering to
himself again.</p>

<p>Merana caught him there, caught his sleeve and spoke
swiftly and low. &ldquo;My Lord Dragon, it would be for the best if you
remained. You have seen what your being <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> has
done already. With you here, I believe she will continue to reveal
what she wants to hide and give agreement before we give
anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are Gray Ajah,&rdquo; he told her harshly. &ldquo;Negotiate!
Dashiva, come with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On deck, he drew deep breaths. The cloudless sky was
open overhead. Open.</p>

<p>It took him a moment to notice Bera and the other two
sisters, watching him expectantly, Flinn and Narishma kept to what
they were supposed to do, a quarter of an eye on the ship and the
rest on the riverbanks, the city on one side and the half-rebuilt
granaries on the other. A ship in mid-river was a vulnerable place
to be if one of the Forsaken decided to strike. For that matter,
anywhere was a dangerous place then. Rand could not understand why
one of them had not at least tried to destroy the Sun Palace around
his ears.</p>

<p>Min took his arm, and he gave a start.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have
left you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;Merana is
already setting to work. I think she means to get you Harine&rsquo;s
best blouse, and maybe her second best as well. The Wavemistress
looked like a rabbit caught between two ferrets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand nodded. The Sea Folk were his, or as good as.
What matter whether the Horn of Valere was in the White Tower? He
was <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>. He was the Dragon Reborn, and the
Coramoor. The golden sun still burned well short of its noon peak. &ldquo;The day is young yet, Min.&rdquo; He could do anything. &ldquo;Would you like
to see me settle the rebels? A thousand crowns to a kiss,
they&rsquo;re mine before sunset.&rdquo;</p>
