<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">M</span>ountains
rose all around Galina Casban, little more
than large hills behind but snowcapped peaks ahead and higher peaks
beyond those, yet she really saw none of them. The stones of the
slope bruised her bare feet. She panted, lungs laboring already.
The sun baked overhead as it had for seemingly endless days,
burning the sweat out of her in rivers. Anything other than putting
one foot in front of the other seemed beyond her. Strange that with
all the sweat coming out of her, she could not find any moisture in
her mouth.</p>

<p>She had been Aes Sedai fewer than ninety years, her
long black hair untouched as yet by gray, but for nearly twenty of
those she had been head of the Red Ajah&mdash;called the Highest
by other Red sisters, in private; considered by other Reds equal to
the Amyrlin Seat&mdash;and for all but five of the years she had
worn the shawl, she had been of the Black Ajah, in truth. Not to
the exclusion of her duties as a Red, but superior to them. Her
place on the Supreme Council of the Black Ajah was next to that of
Alviarin herself, and she was one of only three who knew the name
of the woman who led their hooded meetings. She could speak any
name in those meetings&mdash;a king&rsquo;s&mdash;and know that
name belonged to the dead. It had happened, with a king and with a
queen. She had helped to break two Amyrlins, twice helped turn the
most powerful woman in the world into a squealing wretch eager to
tell all she knew, had helped make it seem that one of those had
died in her sleep and had seen the other deposed and stilled. Such
things were a duty, like the need to exterminate men with the
ability to channel, not actions she took pleasure in beyond that of
tasks well done, but she had enjoyed leading the circle that
stilled Siuan Sanche. Surely all those things meant that Galina
Casban was herself among the mightiest of the world, among the most
powerful. Surely they did. They must.</p>

<p>Her legs wavered like springs that had lost their
tempering, and she fell heavily, unable to catch herself with arms
and elbows tightly bound behind her. The once-white silk shift, the
only garment left to her, tore again as she slid on the loose
rocks, scraping her welts. A tree stopped her. Face pressed against
the ground, she began to sob. &ldquo;How?&rdquo; she moaned in a thick voice. &ldquo;How can this happen to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a time she realized that she had not been
pulled to her feet; no matter how often she fell, she had never
before been allowed a moment&rsquo;s respite. Blinking away tears,
she raised her head.</p>

<p>Aiel women covered the mountainside, several hundred
of them scattered among the barren trees with their spears, the
veils they could raise in an instant hanging down their chests.
Galina wanted to laugh. Maidens; they called these monstrous women
Maidens. She wished she could laugh. At least there were no men
present, a small mercy. Men made her skin crawl, and if one could
see her now, less than half-clothed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anxiously, her eyes sought for Therava, but most of
the seventy or so Wise Ones stood together looking at something
farther up the slope, blocking her view. There seemed to be a
murmur of voices from the front of them. Maybe the Wise Ones were
conferring about something. Wise Ones. They had been brutally
efficient in teaching her the correct names; never just Aiel woman,
and never wilder. They could smell contempt however she hid it. Of
course, you did not have to try hiding what had been seared out of
you.</p>

<p>Most of the Wise Ones were looking away, but not all.
The glow of <em>saidar</em> surrounded a young, pretty, red-haired
woman with a delicate mouth who watched Galina with large, intent
blue eyes. Perhaps as a sign of their own disdain, they had chosen
the weakest of their number to shield her this morning. Micara was
not truly weak in the Power&mdash;none of them were that&mdash;but even smarting from shoulders to knees as she was, Galina could
have broken Micara&rsquo;s shield with little effort. A muscle in
her cheek spasmed uncontrollably; it always did when she thought of
another escape attempt. The first had been bad enough. The second&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Shuddering, she fought not to sob again. She would not make the
attempt again until she was sure of complete success. Very sure.
Absolutely sure.</p>

<p>The mass of Wise Ones parted, turning to follow
Therava with their eyes as the hawk-faced woman strode toward
Galina. Suddenly panting once more, with apprehension, Galina tried
to struggle to her feet. Hands bound and muscles watery, she had
only reached her knees when Therava bent over her, necklaces of
ivory and gold clattering softly. Seizing a handful of
Galina&rsquo;s hair, Therava forced her head back sharply. Taller
than most men, the woman did that even when they were standing,
craning Galina&rsquo;s neck painfully to make her look up into the
Wise One&rsquo;s face. Therava was somewhat stronger in the Power
than she, which relatively few women were, but that was not what
made Galina tremble. Cold deep blue eyes stabbed into her own, held
her more tightly than Therava&rsquo;s rough hand; they seemed to
strip her soul naked as easily as the Wise One handled her. She had
not begged yet, not when they made her walk all day with hardly a
drop of water, not when they forced her to keep up as they ran for
hours, not even when their switches made her howl. Therava&rsquo;s
cruel hard face, staring down at her impassively, made her want to
beg. Sometimes she woke at night, stretched out tight between the
four stakes where they bound her, woke whimpering from dreams that
her whole life would be lived under Therava&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is collapsing already,&rdquo; the Wise One said in a
voice like stone. &ldquo;Water her, and bring her.&rdquo; Turning away, she
adjusted her shawl, Galina Casban forgotten until there was need to
recall her; to Therava, Galina Casban was less important than a
stray dog.</p>

<p>Galina did not try to rise; she had been &ldquo;watered&rdquo;
often enough by now. It was the only way they let her drink. Aching
for moisture, she did not resist when a blocky Maiden took her by
the hair as Therava had and pulled her head back. She just opened
her mouth as far as she could. Another Maiden, with a puckered scar
slanting across nose and cheek, tilted a waterskin and slowly
poured a trickle into Galina&rsquo;s waiting mouth. The water was
flat and warm; it was delicious. She swallowed convulsively,
awkwardly, holding her jaws wide. Almost as much as water to drink,
she wanted to move her face under that thin stream, to let it run
over her cheeks and forehead. Instead she kept her head very
steady, so that every drop went down her throat. Spilling water was
cause for another beating; they had thrashed her in sight of a
creek six paces wide for spilling a mouthful over her chin.</p>

<p>When the waterskin was finally taken away, the blocky
Maiden hauled her to her feet by her bound elbows. Galina groaned.
The Wise Ones were gathering their skirts over their arms, exposing
their legs well above soft knee-high boots. They could not be going
to run. Not again. Not in these mountains.</p>

<p>The Wise Ones loped forward as easily as if on level
ground. An unseen Maiden cut Galina across the back of her thighs
with a switch, and she stumbled to a semblance of a run,
half-dragged by the blocky Maiden. The switch slashed her legs
whenever they faltered. If this run continued the rest of the day,
they would take turns, one Maiden wielding the stick and another
dragging. Laboring up slopes and nearly sliding down, Galina ran. A
tawny mountain cat, striped in shades of brown and heavier than a
man, snarled at them from a rocky ledge above; a female, lacking
the tufts on her ears and the wide cheeks. Galina wanted to shout
at her to flee, to run before Therava caught her. The Aiel ran on
by the snarling animal, unconcerned, and Galina wept with jealousy
for the cat&rsquo;s freedom.</p>

<p>She would be rescued eventually, of course; she knew
that. The Tower would not allow a sister to remain in captivity.
Elaida would not allow a Red to be held. Surely Alviarin would send
rescue. Someone would, anyone, to save her from these monsters,
especially from Therava. She would promise anything for that
deliverance. She would even keep those promises. She had been
broken free of the Three Oaths on joining the Black Ajah, replacing
them with a new trinity, but at that moment she truly believed she
would keep her word, if it brought rescue. Any promise, to anyone
who would free her. Even a man.</p>

<p>By the time low tents appeared, their dark colors
fading into the forested mountainsides as well as the cat had,
Galina had two Maidens supporting her, pulling her along. Shouts
rose from every side, glad cries of greeting, but Galina was
dragged on behind the Wise Ones, deeper into the camp, still
running, stumbling.</p>

<p>Without warning the hands left her arms. She pitched
forward on her face and lay there with her nose in the dirt and
dead leaves, sucking air through her gaping mouth. She coughed on a
piece of leaf, but she was too weak to turn her head. The blood
pounded her ears, but voices came to her and slowly began to make
sense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Took your time, Therava,&rdquo; a familiar-sounding
woman&rsquo;s voice said. &ldquo;Nine days. We have been back long
since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nine days? Galina shook her head, scrubbing her face
on the ground. Since the Aiel had shot her horse from under her,
memory blended all the days into a melange of thirst and running
and being beaten, but surely it had been longer ago than nine days.
Weeks, certainly. A month or more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring her in,&rdquo; the familiar voice said
impatiently.</p>

<p>Hands pulled her up, shoved her forward, bending her
to go under the edge of a large tent with the sides raised all
around. She was thrown down on layered carpets, the edge of a
red-and-blue Tairen maze overlapping gaudy flowers beneath her
nose. With difficulty, she raised her head.</p>

<p>At first, she saw nothing but Sevanna, seated on a
large yellow-tasseled cushion in front of her. Sevanna with her
hair like fine-spun gold, her clear emerald eyes. Treacherous
Sevanna, who had given her word to distract attention by raiding
into Cairhien, then broken her pledge by trying to free
al&rsquo;Thor. Sevanna, who at the least might take her from
Therava&rsquo;s clutches.</p>

<p>She struggled up onto her knees, and for the first
time realized there were others in the tent. Therava sat on a
cushion to Sevanna&rsquo;s right, at the head of a curving line of
Wise Ones, fourteen women who could channel in all, though Micara,
who still held the shield on her, stood at the foot of the line
rather than sitting. Half of them had been among the Wise
Ones who captured her with such scornful ease. She would never
again be so careless about Wise Ones; never again. Short,
pale-faced men and women in white robes moved behind the Wise Ones,
wordlessly offering trays of gold or silver with small cups, and
more did the same on the other side of the tent, where a
gray-haired woman in an Aiel coat and breeches of brown and gray
sat to Sevanna&rsquo;s left, at the head of a line of twelve
stone-faced Aielmen. Men. And she wore nothing but her shift,
ripped and gaping in a number of places. Galina clamped her teeth
shut to stifle a scream. She forced her back stiff to keep from
trying to burrow into the rugs and hide from those cold male
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems that Aes Sedai can lie,&rdquo; Sevanna said, and
the blood drained from Galina&rsquo;s face. The woman could not
know; she could not. &ldquo;You made pledges, Galina Casban, and broke
them. Did you think you could murder a Wise One and then run beyond
the reach of our spears?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment, relief froze Galina&rsquo;s tongue.
Sevanna did <em>not</em> know about the Black Ajah. Had she not
abandoned the Light long ago, she would have thanked the Light.
Relief stilled her tongue, and a tiny spark of indignation. They
<em>attacked</em> Aes Sedai and were angry when some of them died?
A tiny spark was all she could manage. After all, what was
Sevanna&rsquo;s twisting facts alongside days of beatings and
Therava&rsquo;s eyes? A pained, croaking laugh bubbled up at the
absurdity of it. Her throat was so dry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be thankful some of you still live,&rdquo; she managed
past her laughter. &ldquo;Even now it is not too late to rectify your
mistakes, Sevanna.&rdquo; With an effort, she swallowed rueful mirth
before it turned to tears. Just before. &ldquo;When I return to the White
Tower, I will remember those who assist me, even now.&rdquo; She would
have added, &ldquo;and those who do otherwise,&rdquo; but Therava&rsquo;s
unwavering stare set fear fluttering in her middle. For all she
knew, Therava still might be allowed to do whatever she wished.
There had to be some way to induce Sevanna to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;take charge of
her. That tasted bitter, yet anything was better than Therava.
Sevanna was ambitious, and greedy. In the midst of frowning at
Galina, she had caught sight of her own hand and directed a brief,
admiring smile at rings set with large emeralds and firedrops. She
wore rings on half her fingers, and necklaces of pearls and rubies
and diamonds fit for any queen draped across the swell of her
bosom. Sevanna could not be trusted, but perhaps she could be
bought. Therava was a force of nature; as well try to buy a flood
or an avalanche. &ldquo;I trust that you will do what is right, Sevanna,&rdquo;
she finished. &ldquo;The rewards of friendship with the White Tower are
great.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a long moment, there was silence except for the
whisper of the white robes as the servants moved with their trays.
Then&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are <em>da&rsquo;tsang</em>,&rdquo; Sevanna said.
Galina blinked. She was a <em>despised</em> one? Certainly they had
displayed their contempt plainly, but why&mdash;?</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are <em>da&rsquo;tsang</em>,&rdquo; a round-faced Wise
One she did not know intoned, and a woman a hand taller than
Therava repeated, &ldquo;You are <em>da&rsquo;tsang</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Therava&rsquo;s hawklike face might have been carved
from wood, yet her eyes, fixed on Galina, glittered accusingly.
Galina felt nailed to the spot where she knelt, unable to move a
muscle. A hypnotized bird watching a serpent slither nearer. No one
had ever made her feel that way. No one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three Wise Ones have spoken.&rdquo; Sevanna&rsquo;s
satisfied smile was almost welcoming. Therava&rsquo;s face was
stark. The woman did not like whatever had just happened. Something
<em>had</em> happened, even if Galina did not know what. Except
that it appeared to have delivered her from Therava. That was more
than enough for the moment. More than enough.</p>

<p>When Maidens cut her bounds and stuffed her into a
black wool robe, she was so grateful she almost did not care that
they tore off the remnants of her shift first, in front of those
ice-eyed men. The thick wool was hot and itchy and scratchy on her
welts, and she welcomed it as though it were silk. Despite Micara
still shielding her, she could have laughed as the Maidens led her
out of the tent. It did not take long for that desire to vanish
entirely. It did not take her long to begin wondering whether
begging on her knees before Sevanna would do any good. She would
have done it, could she have gotten to the woman, except that
Micara made it plain she was not going anywhere she was not told to
go, or speak a word unless spoken to.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Arms folded, Sevanna watched the Aes Sedai, the <em>da&rsquo;tsang</em>, stagger down the mountainside and stop, beside
a Maiden squatting on her heels with a switch, to drop the
head-shaped stone she had been carrying in her hands. The black
hood turned in Sevanna&rsquo;s direction for a moment, but the <em>da&rsquo;tsang</em> quickly bent to pick up another large stone and
turned to labor back up the fifty paces to where Micara waited with
another Maiden. There she dropped that stone, picked up another,
and started back down. <em>Da&rsquo;tsang</em> were always shamed
with useless labor; unless there was great need, the woman would
not be allowed to carry even a cup of water, yet toil without
purpose would fill her hours till she burst of shame. The sun had a
long way to climb yet, and many more days lay ahead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not think she would condemn herself out of her
own mouth,&rdquo; Rhiale said at Sevanna&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Efalin and the
others are all but sure she openly admitted killing Desaine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is mine, Sevanna.&rdquo; Therava&rsquo;s jaw tightened.
She might have taken the woman, but <em>da&rsquo;tsang</em> belonged
to no one. &ldquo;I intended to dress her in <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>
robes of silk,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;What is the purpose of this,
Sevanna? I expected to have to argue against cutting her throat,
not this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rhiale tossed her head, casting a sidelong glance at
Sevanna. &ldquo;Sevanna intends to break her. We have had long talks of
what to do should we capture any Aes Sedai. Sevanna wants a tame
Aes Sedai to wear white and serve her. An Aes Sedai in black will
do well enough, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sevanna shifted her shawl, irritated by the
woman&rsquo;s tone. Not quite mocking, but all too aware that she
wanted somehow to use the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s channeling as though it
were Sevanna&rsquo;s own. It would be possible. Two <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> passed the three Wise Ones, carrying a large
brass-strapped chest between them. Short and pale-faced, husband
and wife, they had been Lord and Lady in the treekillers&rsquo;
lands. The pair bowed their heads more meekly than any Aiel in
white ever could have managed; their dark eyes were tight with fear
of a harsh word, much less a switch. Wetlanders could be tamed like
horses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The woman is tamed already,&rdquo; Therava grumbled. &ldquo;I
have looked into her eyes. She is a bird fluttering in the hand and
afraid to fly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In nine days?&rdquo; Rhiale said incredulously, and
Sevanna shook her head vigorously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is Aes Sedai, Therava. You saw her face go pale
with fury when I accused her. You heard her laugh as she spoke of
killing Wise Ones.&rdquo; She made a vexed, angry sound. &ldquo;And you heard
her threaten us.&rdquo; The woman had been as slippery as the
treekillers, speaking of rewards and letting the threat if no
rewards came shout silently. But what else could be expected of Aes
Sedai? &ldquo;It will take long to break her, but this Aes Sedai will beg
to obey if it takes a year.&rdquo; Once she did that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Aes Sedai
could not lie, of course; she had expected Galina to deny her
accusation. Once she swore to obey&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you want to make an Aes Sedai obey you,&rdquo; a
man&rsquo;s voice said behind her, &ldquo;this might help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Incredulous, Sevanna spun about to find Caddar
standing there, and beside him the woman&mdash;the Aes Sedai&mdash;Maisia, both dressed in dark silk and fine lace as they had
been six days ago, each with a bulging sack hanging incongruously
from one shoulder by a strap. Caddar held out a smooth white rod
about a foot long in one dark hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you come here?&rdquo; she demanded, then
compressed her lips in anger. Plainly he had come as he had before;
she was just surprised at him appearing here, in the middle of the
camp. She snatched the white rod he offered, and as always he
stepped back beyond arm&rsquo;s reach. &ldquo;Why have you come?&rdquo; she
amended. &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; A little slimmer than her wrist, the rod
was smooth except for a few odd, flowing symbols incised on one
flat end. It felt not quite like ivory, not quite like glass. Very
cool to the touch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might call it an Oath Rod,&rdquo; Caddar said, showing
teeth in what was doubtless meant for a smile. &ldquo;It only came into
my hands yesterday, and I immediately thought of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sevanna clamped her hands tight around the rod to
keep from hurling it away. Everyone knew what the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s
Oath Rod did. Trying not even to think, much less speak, she thrust
it behind her belt and took her hands away.</p>

<p>Rhiale frowned at the rod at Sevanna&rsquo;s waist,
and her eyes rose slowly, coldly, to Sevanna&rsquo;s face. Therava
adjusted her shawl in a clatter of bracelets, and gave a hard, thin
smile. There would never be any chance of one of them touching the
rod and maybe no chance of any other Wise One doing so either. But
there was still Galina Casban. One day she would break.</p>

<p>Raven-eyed Maisia, a little behind Caddar, smiled
almost as faintly as Therava. She had seen, and understood. She was
observant, for a wetlander.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; Sevanna told Caddar. &ldquo;We will drink tea in my
tent.&rdquo; She certainly would not share water with him. Lifting her
skirts, she started up the slope.</p>

<p>To her surprise, Caddar was also observant. &ldquo;All you
need do is have your Aes Sedai&rdquo;&mdash;walking easily beside her on
his long legs, he grinned suddenly, toothily, at Rhiale and Therava&mdash;&ldquo;or any woman who can channel hold the rod and speak
whatever promises you wish while someone channels a little Spirit
into the number. The marks on the end of the rod?&rdquo; he added,
raising his eyebrows insultingly. &ldquo;You can use it to release her,
too but that is more painful. Or so I understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sevanna&rsquo;s fingers touched the rod lightly. More
glass than ivory, and very cool. &ldquo;It only works on women?&rdquo; She
ducked into the tent ahead of him. The Wise Ones and the leaders of
the warrior societies were gone, but the dozen treekiller <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> remained, kneeling patiently to one side. No
one person had ever kept a dozen <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> before,
and she possessed more. There would have to be a new name for them,
though, since they would never put off the white.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Women who can channel, Sevanna,&rdquo; Caddar said,
following her in. The man&rsquo;s tone was incredibly insolent. His
dark eyes shone with open amusement. &ldquo;You will have to wait until
you have al&rsquo;Thor before I give you what will control him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Removing the sack from his shoulder, he sat. Not on a
cushion near hers, of course. Maisia was not afraid of a blade in
her ribs; she lounged on an elbow almost at Sevanna&rsquo;s side.
Sevanna eyed her sideways, then casually undid another lace of her
own blouse. She did not recall the woman&rsquo;s bosom being as
round as that. For that matter, her face seemed even more
beautiful, as well. Sevanna tried not to grind her teeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Caddar went on, &ldquo;if you mean some other
man&mdash;There is a thing called a binding chair. Binding people
who cannot channel is more difficult than binding those who can.
Perhaps a binding chair survived the Breaking, but you will have to
wait while I find it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sevanna touched the rod again, then impatiently
ordered one of the <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> to bring tea. She could wait.
Caddar was a fool. Sooner or later he would give her everything she
wanted of him. And now the rod could break Maisia free of him.
Surely then the woman would not protect him. For his insults, he
would wear black. Sevanna took a small green porcelain cup from the
tray the <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> held and gave it to the Aes Sedai
with her own hands. &ldquo;It is flavored with mint, Maisia. You will
find it refreshing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman smiled, but those black eyes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Well,
what could be done to one Aes Sedai could be done to two. Or
more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What of the traveling boxes?&rdquo; Sevanna demanded
curtly.</p>

<p>Caddar waved the <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> away and
patted the sack beside him. &ldquo;I brought as many <em>nar&rsquo;baha</em>&mdash;that is what they were called&mdash;as
many as I could find. Enough to transport all of you by nightfall,
if you hurry. And I would, if I were you. Al&rsquo;Thor means to
finish you, it seems. Two clans are coming up from the south, and
two more are moving to come down from the north. With their Wise
Ones, all ready to channel. Their orders are to stay until every
last one of you is dead or a prisoner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Therava sniffed. &ldquo;A reason to move, certainly,
wetlander, but not to run. Even four clans cannot sweep
Kinslayer&rsquo;s Dagger in a day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I say?&rdquo; Caddar&rsquo;s smile was not at
all pleasant. &ldquo;It seems al&rsquo;Thor has bound some Aes Sedai to
him, too, and they have taught the Wise Ones how to Travel without
a <em>nar&rsquo;baha</em>, over short distances, at least. Twenty or
thirty miles. A recent rediscovery, it seems. They could be here&mdash;well, today. All four clans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maybe he lied, yet the risk&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Sevanna could
imagine all too well being in Sorilea&rsquo;s grip. Not allowing
herself to shiver, she sent Rhiale to inform the other Wise Ones.
Her voice betrayed nothing.</p>

<p>Reaching into his bag, Caddar drew out a gray stone
cube, smaller than the callbox she had used to summon him, and much
plainer, with no marking but a bright red disc set in one face. &ldquo;This is a <em>nar&rsquo;baha</em>,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It uses <em>saidin</em>, so none of you will see anything, and it has limits.
If a woman touches it, it won&rsquo;t work for days afterward, so I
will have to hand them out myself, and it has other limits. Once
opened, the gateway will remain for a fixed time, sufficient for a
few thousand to go through if they don&rsquo;t waste time, and the
<em>nar&rsquo;baha</em> needs three days to recover afterward. I
have enough extra to carry us where we need to go today, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Therava leaned forward so intently she looked about
to fall over, but Sevanna hardly listened. She did not doubt
Caddar, exactly; he would not dare betray them, not while he
hungered for the gold the Shaido would give him. There were small
things, though. Maisia seemed to study him over her tea. Why? And
if there was such need for speed, why was there no urgency in his
voice? He would not betray, but she would take precautions
anyway.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Maeric frowned at the stone cube the wetlander had
given him, then at the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;hole&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that had appeared when he
pressed the red spot. A hole, five paces wide and three high, in
midair. Beyond lay rolling hills, not low, covered with brown
grass. He did not like things to do with the One Power, especially
with the male part of it. Sevanna stepped through another, smaller,
hole with the wetlander and a dark woman, following the Wise Ones
Sevanna and Rhiale had chosen out. Only a handful of Wise Ones
remained with the Moshaine Shaido. Through that second hole, he
could see Sevanna talking with Bendhuin. The Green Salts sept would
find themselves with few Wise Ones, too; Maeric was sure of it.</p>

<p>Dyrele touched his arm. &ldquo;Husband,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;Sevanna said it would only remain open a short while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maeric nodded. Dyrele always saw straight to the
point. Veiling himself, he ran forward and leaped through the hole
he had made. Whatever Sevanna and the wetlander said, he would send
none of his Moshaine through before he knew it was safe.</p>

<p>He landed heavily on a slope covered with dead grass
and nearly pitched head-over-heels down the hill before he caught
himself. For a moment he stared back up at the hole. On this side,
it hung more than a foot above the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wife!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;There is a drop!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Black Eyes leaped through, veiled and spears ready,
and Maidens, also. As well try to drink sand as try to keep Maidens
from being among the first. The rest of the Moshaine followed at a
run, <em>algai&rsquo;d&rsquo;siswai</em> and wives and children,
jumping down on the fly, craftsfolk and traders and <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>, most pulling heavily loaded packhorses and
mules, near to six thousand altogether. His sept, his people. They
still would be once he went to Rhuidean; Sevanna could not keep him
from becoming clan chief for much longer.</p>

<p>Scouts began spreading out immediately, while the
sept still rushed out of the hole. Lowering his veil, Maeric
shouted orders that sent a screen of <em>algai&rsquo;d&rsquo;siswai</em> toward the crests of the surrounding
hills while everyone else remained concealed below. There was no
telling who or what lay beyond those hills. Rich lands, the
wetlander claimed, but this part did not look rich to him.</p>

<p>The rush of his sept became a flood of <em>algai&rsquo;d&rsquo;siswai</em> he did not really trust, men who had
fled their own clans because they did not believe Rand al&rsquo;Thor
was truly the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>. Maeric was not sure
what he himself believed, but a man did not abandon sept and clan.
These men called themselves <em>Mera&rsquo;din</em>, the
Brotherless, a fitting name, and he had two hundr&mdash;</p>

<p>The hole suddenly snapped into a vertical slash of
silver that sliced through ten of the Brotherless. Pieces of them
fell onto the slope, arms, legs. The front half of a man slid
almost to Maeric&rsquo;s feet.</p>

<p>Staring at the place where the hole had been, he
stabbed at the red spot with his thumb. Useless, he knew, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Darin, his eldest son, was one of the Stone Dogs waiting as a rear
guard. They would have been the last through. Suraile, his eldest
daughter, had remained with the Stone Dog for whom she was thinking
of giving up the spear.</p>

<p>His eyes met Dyrele&rsquo;s, as green and beautiful as
the day she had laid the wreath at his feet. And threatened to cut
his throat if he did not pick it up. &ldquo;We can wait.&rdquo; he said softly.
The wetlander had said three days, but maybe he was wrong. His
thumb stabbed the red spot again. Dyrele nodded calmly; he hoped
there would be no need to cry in one another&rsquo;s arms once they
could be alone.</p>

<p>A Maiden came skittering down the slope from above,
hurriedly lowering her veil, and actually breathing hard. &ldquo;Maeric,&rdquo;
Naeise said, not even waiting for him to see her, &ldquo;there are spears
to the east, only a few miles and running straight at us. I think
they are Reyn. At least seven or eight thousand of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He could see other <em>algai&rsquo;d&rsquo;siswai</em>
running toward him. A young Brother to the Eagle, Cairdin, slid to
a stop, speaking as soon as Maeric saw him. &ldquo;I see you, Maeric.
There are spears no more than five miles to the north, and
wetlanders on horses. Perhaps ten thousand of each. I do not think
any of us broke the crest, but some of the spears have turned
toward us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maeric knew before the grizzled Water Seeker named
Laerad opened his mouth. &ldquo;Spears coming over a hill three or four
miles to the south. Eight thousand or more. Some of them saw one of
the boys.&rdquo; Laerad never wasted words, and he would never say which
boy, who in truth could be anyone without gray hair, to Laerad.</p>

<p>There was no time for wasting words, Maeric knew. &ldquo;Hamal!&rdquo; he shouted. No time for proper courtesy to a blacksmith,
either.</p>

<p>The big man knew something was wrong; he scrambled up
the slope, likely moving faster than he had since first picking up
a hammer.</p>

<p>Maeric handed him the stone cube. &ldquo;You must press the
red spot and keep pressing it, no matter what happens, no matter
how long it takes for that hole to open. That is the only way out
for any of you.&rdquo; Hamal nodded, but Maeric did not even wait for him
to say that he would. Hamal would understand. Maeric touched
Dyrele&rsquo;s cheek, careless of how many eyes were on them. &ldquo;Shade
of my heart, you must prepare to put on white.&rdquo; Her hand strayed
toward the hilt of her belt knife&mdash;she had been a Maiden when
she made his wreath&mdash;but he shook his head firmly. &ldquo;You must
live, wife, roofmistress, to hold together what remains.&rdquo; Nodding,
she pressed fingers to his cheek. He was astonished; she had always
been very reserved in public.</p>

<p>Raising his veil, Maeric shoved one spear high above
his head. &ldquo;Moshaine!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;We dance!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Up the slope they followed him, men and Maidens,
nearly a thousand strong counting the Brotherless. Perhaps they
could be counted among the sept. Up the slope and west; that way
lay the nearest and the fewest. Perhaps they might buy enough time,
though he did not really believe that. He wondered whether Sevanna
had known of this. Ah, the world had grown very strange since Rand
al&rsquo;Thor came. Some things could not change, though. Laughing,
he began to sing.</p>

<p class="verse_quote">&ldquo;Wash the spears, while the sun climbs high.<br>
 Wash the spears, while the sun falls low.<br>
 Wash the spears; who fears to die?<br>
 Wash the spears; no one I know!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Singing, the Moshaine Shaido ran to dance their
deaths.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Frowning, Graendal watched the gateway close behind
the last of the Jumai Shaido. The Jumai and a great many Wise Ones.
Unlike with the others, Sammael had not simply knotted this web so
it would fall apart eventually. At least, she assumed he held it to
the last; the closing, right on the heels of the last
brown-and-gray-clad men, was too fortuitous otherwise. Laughing,
Sammael tossed away the bag, still holding a few of those useless
bits of stone. Her own empty sack was long since discarded. The sun
sat low behind the mountains to the west, half of a glowing red
ball.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of these days,&rdquo; she said dryly, &ldquo;you will be too
smart for your own good. A <em>fool</em> box, Sammael? Suppose one
of them had understood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None did,&rdquo; he said simply, but he kept rubbing his
hands together and staring at where the gateway had been. Or maybe
at something beyond. He still held the Mask of Mirrors, giving him
the illusion of added height. She had dropped hers as soon as the
gateway closed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you certainly managed to put a panic into
them.&rdquo; Around them lay the evidence: a few low tents still
standing, blankets, a cookpot, a rag doll, all sorts of rubbish
lying where it had fallen. &ldquo;Where did you send them? Somewhere
ahead of al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s army, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some,&rdquo; he said absently. &ldquo;Enough.&rdquo; His staring
introspection vanished abruptly, and his disguise as well. The scar
across his face seemed especially livid. &ldquo;Enough to cause trouble,
particularly with their Wise Ones channeling, but not so many that
anyone will suspect me. The rest are scattered from Illian to
Ghealdan. As to how or why? Maybe al&rsquo;Thor did it, for his own
reasons, but I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t have wasted most of them if
it was my work, now would I?&rdquo; He laughed again; caught up in his
own brilliance.</p>

<p>She adjusted the bodice of her dress to cover a
start. Competing that way was remarkably silly&mdash;she had told
herself that ten thousand times, and never listened once&mdash;remarkably silly, and now the dress felt as if it might fall off.
Which had nothing to do with her start. He did not know Sevanna had
taken every Shaido woman who could channel with her. Was it finally
time to abandon him? If she threw herself on Demandred&rsquo;s mercy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As if reading her thoughts, he said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
tied to me as tightly as my belt, Graendal.&rdquo; A gateway opened,
revealing his private rooms in Illian. &ldquo;The truth doesn&rsquo;t
matter anymore, if it ever has. You rise with me, or fall with me.
The Great Lord rewards success, and he&rsquo;s never cared how it
was achieved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you say,&rdquo; she told him. Demandred had no mercy.
And Semirhage&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;I rise or fall with you.&rdquo; Still, something
would have to be worked out. The Great Lord rewarded success, but
she would not be pulled down if Sammael failed. She opened a
gateway to her palace in Arad Doman, to the long columned room
where she could see her pets frolicking in the pool. &ldquo;But what if
al&rsquo;Thor comes after you himself? What then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Al&rsquo;Thor isn&rsquo;t going after anyone,&rdquo; Sammael
laughed. &ldquo;All I have to do is wait.&rdquo; Still laughing, he stepped
into his gateway and let it close.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The Myrddraal moved from the deeper shadows, becoming
visible. In its eyes, the gateways had left a residue&mdash;three
patches of glowing mist. It could not tell one flow from another,
but it could distinguish <em>saidin</em> from <em>saidar</em> by
the smell. <em>Saidin</em> smelled like the sharp edge of a knife,
the point of a thorn. <em>Saidar</em> smelled soft, but like
something that would grow harder the harder it was pressed. No
other Myrddraal could smell that difference. Shaidar Haran was like
no other Myrddraal.</p>

<p>Picking up a discarded spear, Shaidar Haran used it
to upend the bag Sammael had discarded, and then to stir the bits
of stone that fell out. Much was happening outside the plan. Would
these events churn chaos, or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Angry black flames raced down the spear haft from
Shaidar Haran&rsquo;s hand, the hand of the Hand of the Shadow. In
an instant the wooden haft was charred and twisted; the spearhead
dropped off. The Myrddraal let the blackened stick fall and dusted
soot from its palm. If Sammael served chaos, then all was well. If
not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A sudden ache climbed the back of its neck; a faint
weakness washed along its limbs. Too long away from Shayol Ghul.
That tie had to be severed somehow. With a snarl, it turned to find
the edge of shadow that it needed. The day was coming. It would
come.</p>
