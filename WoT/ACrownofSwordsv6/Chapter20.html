<h4><em>Patterns Within Patterns</em></h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">C</span>ontemptuously
Sevanna studied her dusty companions,
seated in a circle with her in the small clearing. The nearly
leafless branches overhead provided a bit of cool shade, and the
place where Rand al&rsquo;Thor had hurled death lay more than a
hundred miles to the west, yet the other women&rsquo;s eyes shifted
with an air of looking over shoulders. Without sweat tents, none
had been able to clean herself properly, no more than a hasty
washing of face and hands at day&rsquo;s end. Eight small silver
cups, all different, sat by her side on the dead leaves, and a
silver pitcher, filled with water, that had been dented in the
retreat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Either the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> is not
following,&rdquo; she said abruptly, &ldquo;or he has been unable to find us.
Either contents me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some of them actually jumped. Tion&rsquo;s round face
paled, and Modarra patted her shoulder. Modarra would have been
pretty if she was not so tall, if she did not always try to mother
everyone within reach. Alarys became much too intent on
straightening skirts already neatly spread around her, attempting
to ignore what she did not want to see. Meira&rsquo;s thin mouth
drew down, but who could say whether for the others&rsquo; open fear
of the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> or her own? They had reason to
be afraid.</p>

<p>Two full days since the battle, and fewer than twenty
thousand spears had grouped around Sevanna. Therava and most of the
Wise Ones who had been to the west were still absent, including all
the rest who were tied to her. Some of the missing surely were
making their way back to Kinslayer&rsquo;s Dagger, but how many
would never again see the sun rise? No one remembered such a
slaughter, so many dead in so short a time. Even the <em>algai&rsquo;d&rsquo;siswai</em> were not truly ready to dance the
spears again so soon. Reason to be afraid, yet none for showing it,
displaying heart and soul on your face like a wetlander, open and
naked for all to see.</p>

<p>Rhiale at least seemed to realize that much. &ldquo;If we
are to do this thing, let us do it,&rdquo; she muttered, stiff with
embarrassment. She was one who had jumped.</p>

<p>Sevanna took the small gray cube from her pouch and
placed it atop the brown leaves in the middle of the circle.
Someryn put her hands on her knees, leaning over to examine it
until she appeared in danger of falling out of her blouse. Her nose
nearly touched the cube. Intricate patterns covered every side, and
close up you could see smaller patterns within the larger, and
still smaller inside those, and a hint of what seemed smaller yet.
How they could have been made, the tiniest so fine, so precise,
Sevanna had no idea. Once she had thought the cube stone, but she
was no longer certain. Yesterday she had dropped it accidentally on
some rocks without marring one line of the carving. If it was
carving. The thing must be a <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>; that they
knew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The smallest flow possible of Fire must be touched
lightly there, on what looks like a twisted crescent moon,&rdquo; she
told them, &ldquo;and another there on the top, on that mark like a
lightning bolt.&rdquo; Someryn straightened very quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will happen then?&rdquo; Alarys asked, combing her
hair with her fingers. It seemed an absentminded gesture, but she
always found ways to remind everyone that her hair was black
instead of common yellow or red.</p>

<p>Sevanna smiled. She enjoyed knowing what they did
not. &ldquo;I will use it to summon the wetlander who gave it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That much you told us already,&rdquo; Rhiale said in a
sour voice, and Tion bluntly asked, &ldquo;How will it summon him?&rdquo; She
might fear Rand al&rsquo;Thor, but not a great deal else. Certainly
not Sevanna. Belinde lightly stroked the cube with one bony finger,
her sun-bleached eyebrows drawn down.</p>

<p>Maintaining a smooth face, Sevanna irritably
prevented her hands from fingering a necklace or adjusting her
shawl. &ldquo;I have told you all you need know.&rdquo; Considerably more than
they needed, in her opinion, but it had been necessary. Otherwise
they would all be back with the spears and the other Wise Ones,
eating hard bread and dried meat. Or rather they would all be on
the move eastward, watching for any sign of other survivors.
Watching for any sign of pursuit. With a late start, they might
still cover fifty miles before halting. &ldquo;Words will not skin the
boar, much less kill it. If you have decided to creep back to the
mountains and spend your lives running and hiding, then go. If not,
then do what you must, and I will do my part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rhiale&rsquo;s blue eyes stared flat defiance, and
Tion&rsquo;s gray. Even Modarra looked doubtful, and she and Someryn
lay the most solidly in her grasp.</p>

<p>Sevanna waited, outwardly calm, unwilling to tell
them again or ask. Inside, her stomach churned with anger. She
would not be beaten because these women had pale hearts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we must,&rdquo; Rhiale sighed at last. Excepting the
absent Therava, she resisted most often, but Sevanna had hopes of
her. The spine that refused to bend at all was often the most
malleable once it gave way. That was as true for women as men.
Rhiale and the others turned their eyes to the cube, some
frowning.</p>

<p>Sevanna saw nothing, of course. In fact, she realized
that if they did nothing, they could claim the cube failed to work,
and she would never know.</p>

<p>Abruptly, though, Someryn gasped, and Meira almost
whispered, &ldquo;It draws more. Look.&rdquo; She pointed. &ldquo;Fire there and
there, and Earth, and Air and Spirit, filling the runnels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not all of them,&rdquo; Belinde said. &ldquo;They could be
filled many ways, I think. And there are places where the flows&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;twist&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;around something that is not there.&rdquo; Her forehead
furrowed. &ldquo;It must be drawing the male part, as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Several drew back a little, shifting shawls, brushing
skirts as though to rub away dirt. Sevanna would have given
anything to see. Almost anything. How could they be such cowards?
How could they let it show?</p>

<p>Finally Modarra said, &ldquo;I wonder what would happen if
we touched it with Fire elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Power the callbox too much or in the wrong way, and
it may melt,&rdquo; a man&rsquo;s voice said out of the air. &ldquo;It could
even ex&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The voice cut off as the other women surged to their
feet, peering in among the trees. Alarys and Modarra went so far as
to draw their belt knives, though they had no need of steel when
they had the One Power. Nothing moved among the sun-streaked
shadows, not so much as a bird.</p>

<p>Sevanna did not stir. She had believed perhaps a
third of what of the wetlander had told her, not including this, in
truth, but she recognized Caddar&rsquo;s voice. Wetlanders always
had more names, but that was all he had given. A man of many
secrets, she suspected. &ldquo;Take your places again,&rdquo; she ordered. &ldquo;And
put the flows back where they were. How can I summon him if you
fear words?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rhiale swung around, mouth gaping and eyes
incredulous. Undoubtedly wondering how she knew they had stopped
channeling; the woman was not thinking clearly. Slowly, uneasily,
they settled in the circle again. Rhiale donned a flatter face than
anyone else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you are back,&rdquo; Caddar&rsquo;s voice said from the
air. &ldquo;Do you have al&rsquo;Thor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something in his tone warned her. He could not know.
But he did. She abandoned all she had prepared to say. &ldquo;No, Caddar.
But we still must talk. I will meet you in ten days where we first
met.&rdquo; She could reach that valley in Kinslayer&rsquo;s Dagger
sooner, but she needed time to prepare. How did he know?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well that you told the truth, girl,&rdquo; Caddar murmured
dryly. &ldquo;You will learn I do not like being lied to. Maintain the
wayline for location, and I will come to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sevanna stared at the cube in shock. <em>Girl?</em> &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; she demanded. <em>Girl!</em> She could not
believe her ears. Rhiale very pointedly did not look at her, and
Meira&rsquo;s mouth twisted in a smile, awkward because so seldom
used.</p>

<p>Caddar&rsquo;s sigh filled the clearing. &ldquo;Tell your
Wise One to continue doing exactly what she is doing&mdash;nothing
else&mdash;and I will come to you.&rdquo; The forced patience in his
tone scraped like a grist-stone. When she had what she wanted from
the wetlander, she would dress him in <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> white. No, in
black!</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, you will come, Caddar?&rdquo; Silence
answered. &ldquo;Caddar, where are you?&rdquo; Silence. &ldquo;Caddar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The others exchanged uneasy glances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he mad?&rdquo; Tion said. Alarys muttered that he must
be, and Belinde angrily demanded to know how long they were to
continue this nonsense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Until I say to stop,&rdquo; Sevanna said softly, staring
at the cube. A prickle of hope wormed through her chest. If he
could do this, then surely he could deliver what he had promised.
And maybe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She would not hope too much. She looked up through
the branches that nearly met above the clearing. The sun still had
a way to climb to its peak. &ldquo;If he has not come by midday, we will
go.&rdquo; It was too much to expect they would not grumble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So we sit here like stones?&rdquo; Alarys tossed her head
in a practiced way, sweeping all of her hair over one shoulder. &ldquo;For a wetlander?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever he promised you, Sevanna,&rdquo; Rhiale said with
a scowl, &ldquo;it cannot be worth this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is mad,&rdquo; Tion growled.</p>

<p>Modarra nodded toward the cube. &ldquo;What if he can still
hear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tion sniffed dismissively, and Someryn said, &ldquo;How
should we care if a man hears what we say? But I do not relish
waiting for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What if he is like those wetlanders in black coats?&rdquo;
Belinde compressed her lips till they nearly matched
Meira&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not be ridiculous,&rdquo; Alarys sneered. &ldquo;Wetlanders
kill such men on sight. Whatever the <em>algai&rsquo;d&rsquo;siswai</em> claim, that must have been the work
of the Aes Sedai. And Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo; That name produced a
pained silence, but it did not last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Caddar must have a cube like this one,&rdquo; Belinde
said. &ldquo;He must have a woman with the gift to make it work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An Aes Sedai?&rdquo; Rhiale made a noise of disgust in her
throat. &ldquo;If there are ten Aes Sedai with him, let them come. We
will deal with them as they deserve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meira laughed, a dry sound as narrow as her face. &ldquo;I
think you almost begin to believe they did kill Desaine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch your tongue!&rdquo; Rhiale snarled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Someryn murmured anxiously. &ldquo;Careless words
might be heard by the wrong ears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tion&rsquo;s laugh was short and unpleasant. &ldquo;The lot
of you has less courage than one wetlander.&rdquo; Which made Someryn
snap back, of course, and Modarra too, and Meira spoke words that
would have brought a challenge had they not been Wise Ones, and
Alarys spoke harsher, and Belinde&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Their squabbling irritated Sevanna, though it
guaranteed they would not conspire against her. But that was not
why she raised a hand for silence. Rhiale frowned at her, opening
her mouth, and in that moment they heard what she did. Something
rustled in the dead leaves among the trees. No Aiel would make so
much noise, even if any would approach Wise Ones unbidden, and no
animal would come so near people. This time, she rose to her feet
with the others.</p>

<p>Two shapes appeared, a man and a woman, breaking
enough branches underfoot to wake a stone. Just short of the
clearing, they stopped, and the man bent his head slightly to speak
to the woman. It was Caddar, in a nearly black coat with lace at
his neck and wrists. At least he did not wear a sword. They seemed
to be arguing. Sevanna should have been able to hear something of
their words, yet the silence was complete. Caddar stood nearly a
hand taller than Modarra&mdash;tall for a wetlander, or even for
an Aiel&mdash;and the woman&rsquo;s head reached no higher than his
chest. As dark of face and hair as he, and beautiful enough to
tighten Sevanna&rsquo;s mouth, she wore bright red silk, cut to
expose even more of her bosom than Someryn showed.</p>

<p>As if thinking of the woman called her, Someryn drew
close to Sevanna. &ldquo;The woman has the gift,&rdquo; she whispered without
taking her eyes from the pair. &ldquo;She weaves a barrier.&rdquo; Pursing her
lips, she added, reluctantly, &ldquo;She is strong. Very strong.&rdquo; From
her, that meant something indeed. Sevanna had never been able to
understand why strength in the Power did not count among Wise Ones&mdash;while being thankful that it did not, for her own sake&mdash;but Someryn prided herself that she had never encountered a
woman near as strong as she. By her tone, Sevanna suspected this
woman was stronger.</p>

<p>Right then, she did not care whether the woman could
move mountains or barely light a candle. She must be Aes Sedai. She
did not have the face, yet some Sevanna had seen did not. That must
be how Caddar could put his hand on <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. That
was how he could find them and come. So soon; so quickly.
Possibilities unfolded, and hope grew. But between him and her, who
commanded?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop channeling into that,&rdquo; she ordered. He might
still be able to hear through it.</p>

<p>Rhiale gave her a look that did not stop short of
pity. &ldquo;Someryn already did, Sevanna.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nothing could spoil her mood. She smiled and said, &ldquo;Very well. Remember what I said. Let me do all of the talking.&rdquo;
Most of the others nodded; Rhiale sniffed. Sevanna kept her smile.
A Wise One could not be made <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>, but so many
worn-out customs had been set aside already that others might
follow.</p>

<p>Caddar and the woman started forward, and Someryn
whispered again. &ldquo;She still holds the Power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit next to me,&rdquo; Sevanna told her hastily. &ldquo;Touch my
leg if she channels.&rdquo; How that galled. But she must know.</p>

<p>She sat, folding her legs under, and the others
joined her, leaving a space for Caddar and the woman. Someryn sat
close enough that their knees touched. Sevanna wished she had a
chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you, Caddar,&rdquo; she said formally, in spite of
his insult. &ldquo;Sit, you and your woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She wanted to see how the Aes Sedai reacted, but all
she did was arch an eyebrow and smile lazily. Her eyes were as
black as his, as black as a raven&rsquo;s. The other Wise Ones let a
little coldness show. Had the Aes Sedai at the wells not allowed
Rand al&rsquo;Thor to break free, they surely would have killed or
captured every one. This Aes Sedai must be aware of that, since
Caddar plainly knew what had happened, yet she looked anything but
afraid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Maisia,&rdquo; Caddar said, lowering himself to
the ground, a little short of the space left for him. For some
reason, he did not like to come within arm&rsquo;s reach. Perhaps he
feared knives. &ldquo;I told you to use a single Wise One, Sevanna, not
seven. Some men might be suspicious.&rdquo; For some reason, he seemed
amused.</p>

<p>The woman, Maisia, paused in the act of smoothing her
skirts under when he gave her name, glaring at him with a fury that
should have stripped his hide away. Perhaps she had thought to keep
her identity hidden. She said nothing, though. After a moment she
sat beside him, her smile returning so suddenly it might never have
gone. Not for the first time, Sevanna was thankful that wetlanders
wore their emotions on their faces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have brought the thing that can control Rand
al&rsquo;Thor?&rdquo; She did not even glance at the pitcher of water.
When he was so rude, why should she continue the forms? She did not
remember him being so when they met before. Perhaps the Aes Sedai
emboldened him.</p>

<p>Caddar gave her a quizzical look. &ldquo;Why, when you do
not have him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; she said levelly, and he smiled. So did
Maisia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you do, then.&rdquo; His smile shouted of doubt and
disbelief. The woman&rsquo;s mocked. A black robe could be found for
her, too. &ldquo;What I have will control him once he is taken, but it
cannot overcome him. I won&rsquo;t risk him finding out about me
until you have him secure.&rdquo; He did not appear shamed in the
slightest by the admission.</p>

<p>Sevanna forced down a stab of disappointment. One
hope gone, but others remained. Rhiale and Tion folded their hands
and stared straight ahead, beyond the circle, beyond him; he was no
longer worth listening to. Of course, they did not know
everything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What of Aes Sedai? Can this thing control them?&rdquo;
Rhiale and Tion stopped peering beyond the trees. Belinde&rsquo;s
eyebrows twitched, and Meira actually looked at her. Sevanna could
have cursed their lack of self-control.</p>

<p>Caddar was as blind as all wetlanders, though. He
threw back his head and laughed. &ldquo;Do you mean to say you missed
al&rsquo;Thor but captured Aes Sedai? You grabbed at the eagle and
caught a few larks!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you provide the same for Aes Sedai?&rdquo; She wanted
to grind her teeth. Surely he had been properly courteous
before.</p>

<p>He shrugged. &ldquo;Perhaps. If the price is right.&rdquo; It was
dust to him, of no moment. For that matter, Maisia showed no
concern either. Strange, if she was Aes Sedai. But she must be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your tongue tosses bright colors on the wind,
wetlander,&rdquo; Tion said in a flat voice. &ldquo;What proof of them have
you?&rdquo; For once, Sevanna did not mind that she had spoken out of
turn.</p>

<p>Caddar&rsquo;s face tightened for all the world as if
he were a clan chief, as if he had heard the insult, but in an
instant he was all smiles once more. &ldquo;As you wish. Maisia, play
with the callbox for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Someryn shifted her skirts, pressing her knuckles
against Sevanna&rsquo;s thigh as the gray cube rose a pace into the
air. It bounced back and forth as though tossed from hand to hand,
then tilted and spun on one corner like a top, faster and faster,
until it blurred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you like to see her balance it on her nose?&rdquo;
Caddar asked with a toothy grin.</p>

<p>Tight-eyed, the dark woman stared straight ahead, her
smile clearly forced now. &ldquo;I think I have <em>demonstrated</em>
quite enough, Caddar,&rdquo; she said coldly. But the cube&mdash;the
callbox?&mdash;continued whirling.</p>

<p>Sevanna waited a slow count of twenty before saying, &ldquo;That is sufficient.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may stop now, Maisia,&rdquo; Caddar said. &ldquo;Put it back
where it was.&rdquo; Only then did the cube slowly descend, nestling
gently on its original spot. Dark as she was, the woman looked
pale. And furious.</p>

<p>Had she been alone, Sevanna would have laughed, and
danced. As it was, she had difficulty maintaining a smooth face.
Rhiale and the others were too busy staring disdainfully at Maisia
to notice. What worked on one woman with the gift would work on
another. No need with Someryn and Modarra, perhaps, but Rhiale,
and Therava&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She could not appear too eager, not when the
others knew there were no Aes Sedai captives.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Caddar went on, &ldquo;it will take a little
time to provide you with what you wish.&rdquo; He took on a sly look,
trying to hide it; perhaps another wetlander would not have seen. &ldquo;I warn you, the price will not be small.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In spite of herself, Sevanna leaned forward. &ldquo;And the
way you traveled here so quickly? How much to make her teach us
that?&rdquo; She managed to keep eagerness from her voice, but she was
afraid the contempt she felt came through. Wetlanders would do
anything for gold.</p>

<p>Perhaps the man heard it; his eyes certainly widened
in surprise before he could regain control. Such as it was. He
studied his hands, and his mouth curled faintly. Why should his
smile seem pleased? &ldquo;That is not something she does,&rdquo; he said in a
voice as smooth as his palms, &ldquo;not by herself. It is like the
callbox. I can provide you with several, but the price of those is
even higher. I doubt what you&rsquo;ve gleaned from Cairhien will be
enough. Fortunately, you can use the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;traveling boxes to take
your people to richer lands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even Meira was hard-pressed to keep her expression
from becoming too avid. Richer lands, and no need to make a way
through those fools following Rand al&rsquo;Thor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me more,&rdquo; Sevanna said coolly. &ldquo;Richer lands
might be of some interest.&rdquo; Not enough to make her forget the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>, though. Caddar would give her everything
he had promised before she declared him <em>da&rsquo;tsang</em>. As
well that he seemed to like wearing black. There would be no need
to give him any gold then.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The watcher ghosted through the trees, making no
sound. It was wonderful what you could learn with a callbox,
especially in a world where there seemed to be only two others.
That red dress was easy to follow, and they never looked back even
to see whether some of those so-called Aiel were trailing them.
Graendal maintained the Mask of Mirrors that hid her true form, but
Sammael had dropped his, golden-bearded again and just head and
shoulders taller than she. He had let the link between them
dissolve, too. The watcher wondered whether that was wise, under
the circumstances. He had always wondered how much of
Sammael&rsquo;s vaunted bravery was really stupidity and blindness.
But the man did hold <em>saidin</em>; perhaps he was not completely
unaware of his danger.</p>

<p>The watcher followed and listened. They had no idea.
The True Power, drawn directly from the Great Lord, could neither
be seen nor detected except by who wielded it. Black flecks floated
across his vision. There was a price, to be sure, one that grew
with each use, but he had always been willing to pay the price when
it was necessary. Being filled with the True Power was almost like
kneeling beneath Shayol Ghul, basking in the Great Lord&rsquo;s
glory. The glory was worth the pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I had to have you with me,&rdquo; Sammael
growled, stumbling over a dead vine. He had never really been at
home away from the cities. &ldquo;You answered a hundred questions for
them just being there. I can hardly believe that silly girl herself
actually suggested what I wanted.&rdquo; He barked a laugh. &ldquo;Perhaps
I&rsquo;m <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A branch that partially blocked Graendal&rsquo;s path
flexed away until it snapped with a sharp crack. For a moment it
hung in the air as if she intended to strike her companion. &ldquo;That
silly girl will cut out your heart and eat it, given half a
chance.&rdquo; The branch flew aside. &ldquo;I have a few questions of my own.
I never thought you would keep your truce with al&rsquo;Thor any
longer than you must, but this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The watcher&rsquo;s eyebrows rose. A truce? A claim as
risky as it was false, by all evidence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t arrange his kidnapping.&rdquo; Sammael gave
her what he probably thought was a wry look; his scar made it more
a snarl. &ldquo;Mesaana had a hand in it, though. Maybe Demandred and
Semirhage as well, despite how it ended, but Mesaana certainly.
Perhaps you ought to reconsider what you think the Great Lord means
about leaving al&rsquo;Thor unharmed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Graendal considered that, so much so that she
tripped. Sammael caught her by the arm, keeping her on her feet,
but as soon as she regained her balance, she jerked free.
Interesting, even given what had happened back in that clearing.
Graendal&rsquo;s real interest was always the most beautiful plucked
from among the most powerful, but she would have flirted, just to
pass an hour, with a man she intended to kill or one who wanted to
kill her. The only men she never flirted with were those of the
Chosen who stood above her for a time. She never accepted being the
lesser of any pair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why continue with them?&rdquo; Her voice dripped
molten lava, although normally she had exquisite control over her
emotions. &ldquo;Al&rsquo;Thor in Mesaana&rsquo;s hands is one thing;
al&rsquo;Thor in this savage&rsquo;s is something else. Not that
she&rsquo;ll have much chance at him if you really intend sending
them off to loot. <em>Traveling</em> boxes? What is your game
there? Do they hold captives? If you think I will teach them
Compulsion, erase it from your mind. One of those women was not
negligible. I will not risk strength and skill residing together,
in her, or in someone she teaches. Or do you have a binder hidden
away with your other toys? For that matter, where were you earlier?
I do not like having to wait!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sammael stopped, glancing behind them. The watcher
stood very still. Swathed in fancloth except for his eyes, he had
no worry that he would be seen. Over the years he had learned
expertise in many areas Sammael scorned. In some he favored,
too.</p>

<p>The gateway opening suddenly, slicing away half of a
tree, made Graendal jump. The split trunk leaned drunkenly. Now she
also knew Sammael held to the Source.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you think I was telling them the truth?&rdquo; Sammael
said mockingly. &ldquo;Small increases in chaos are as important as
large. They will go where I send them, do as I wish, and learn to
be satisfied with what I give them. As will you, Maisia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Graendal let her Illusion fade and stood
golden-haired as he, as fair as she had been dark. &ldquo;If you call me
that again, I will kill you.&rdquo; Her voice held even less expression
than her face. She meant it. The watcher tensed. If she tried, one
of the two would die. Should he interfere? Black flecks sped across
his eyes, faster, faster.</p>

<p>Sammael met her stare with one just as hard. &ldquo;Remember who will be Nae&rsquo;blis, Graendal,&rdquo; he said, and
stepped through his gateway.</p>

<p>For a moment she stood looking at the opening. A
vertical silver slash appeared off to one side, but before her
gateway began to align, she let go the weave, slowly, the streak
shrinking to a point before winking out. The prickling vanished
from the watcher&rsquo;s skin as she released <em>saidar</em> as well. With a
fixed face, she followed Sammael, and his gateway closed behind
her.</p>

<p>The watcher smiled crookedly behind his fancloth
skulker&rsquo;s mask. Nae&rsquo;blis. That explained what had brought
Graendal to heel, what had stayed her from killing Sammael. Even
she would be blinded by that. An even greater risk for Sammael than
claiming truce with Lews Therin, though. Unless, of course, it was
true. The Great Lord delighted in setting his servants one against
another, to see who was stronger. Only the strongest could stand
near his glory. But today&rsquo;s truth need not be tomorrow&rsquo;s.
The watcher had seen truth change a hundred times between a single
sunrise and sunset. More than once he had changed it himself. He
considered going back and killing the seven women in the clearing.
They would die easily; he doubted they knew how to form a true
circle. The black flecks filled his eyes, a horizontal blizzard.
No, he would let that run its course. For now.</p>

<p>To his ears, the world screamed as he used the True
Power to rip a small hole and step outside the Pattern. Sammael did
not know how truly he spoke. Small increases in chaos could be
every bit as important as large.</p>
