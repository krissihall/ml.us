<h4><em>A Morning of Victory</em></h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
crooked hills and ridges surrounding the camp
showed every sign of the drought and unseasonable heat. The unholy
heat in truth; even the dullest scullion scrubbing pots saw the
Dark One&rsquo;s touch on the world. The true forest lay behind them
to the west, but twisted oaks grew out of the rocky slopes,
sourgums and pines of unfamiliar shape, and trees Egwene had no
names for, brown and yellow and bare-branched. Not winter-bare or
brown. Starved for moisture and coolness. Dying, if the weather did
not change soon. Beyond the last of the soldiers a river ran off
south and west, the Reisendrelle, twenty paces wide and flanked on
either side by hard-baked mud studded with stones. Swirling around
rocks that might have made crossing hazardous in other days, the
water rose short of the horses&rsquo; knees as they forded. Egwene
felt her own problems dwindle in size. Despite her head, she
offered a small prayer for Nynaeve and Elayne. Their search was as
important as anything she did. More. The world would live if she
failed, but they had to succeed.</p>

<p>They traveled southward at an easy canter, slowing
when the hillside slant of the land grew too great or the horses
had to climb any distance through trees and sparse scrub, but
keeping to the lowland as much as possible and covering ground
quickly. Bryne&rsquo;s big-nosed gelding, surefooted and strong,
hardly seemed to mind which way the ground tilted or whether smooth
or rough, yet Daishar kept pace easily. Sometimes Siuan&rsquo;s
plump animal labored, though she might just have been picking up
her rider&rsquo;s anxiety. No amount of practice could make Siuan
anything but a terrible rider, nearly throwing her arms around the
mare&rsquo;s neck climbing upslope, almost falling from the saddle
going down, awkward as a duck afoot on the flats and not far from
wide-eyed as the horse. Myrelle actually regained some of her humor
watching Siuan. Her own white-footed sorrel picked her way in
delicate swoops like a swallow, and Myrelle rode with an assurance
and flare that made Bryne appear stolid and workmanlike.</p>

<p>Before they had gone very far, riders appeared atop a
high ridge to the west, perhaps a hundred men in column, the rising
sun glinting off breastplates and helmets and lance points. At
their head streamed a long white pennant Egwene could not make out,
but she knew it bore the Red Hand. She had not expected to see them
so close to the Aes Sedai camp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dragonsworn animals,&rdquo; Myrelle muttered, watching the
horsemen parallel their route. Her gloved hands tightened on her
reins&mdash;with fury, not fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Band of the Red Hand puts out patrols,&rdquo; Bryne
said placidly. With a glance at Egwene, he added, &ldquo;Lord Talmanes
seems concerned about you, Mother, last I spoke to him.&rdquo; He put no
more emphasis on that than the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve <em>spoken</em> with him?&rdquo; Every vestige
of Myrelle&rsquo;s serenity vanished. The anger she had to hold in
with Egwene, she could safely unleash on him. She all but shook
with it. &ldquo;That is very close to treason, Lord Bryne. It might well
<em>be</em> treason!&rdquo; Siuan had been dividing her attention between
her horse and the men on the ridge, and she did not look at
Myrelle, but she stiffened. No one had tied the Band and treason
together before.</p>

<p>They rounded a bend in the hill valley. A farm clung
to a hillside, or what had been a farm once. One wall of the small
stone house had collapsed, and a few charred timbers stuck up
beside the soot-coated chimney like grimy fingers. The roofless
barn was a blackened hollow box of stone, and scattered ash marked
where sheds might once have stood. All across Altara they had seen
as bad and worse, entire villages sometimes, the dead lying in the
streets, food for ravens and foxes and feral dogs that fled when
people came close. Stories of anarchy and murder in Tarabon and
Arad Doman suddenly had flesh and bones. Many men seized any excuse
to turn bandit or settle old grudges&mdash;Egwene hoped fervently
it was so&mdash;but the name on every survivor&rsquo;s lips was
Dragonsworn, and the sisters blamed Rand as surely as if he had
carried the torches himself. They would use him still if they
could, though, control him if they found a way. She was not the
only Aes Sedai to believe in doing what she must even when she had
to hold her nose.</p>

<p>Myrelle&rsquo;s anger affected Bryne as little as rain
affected a boulder. Egwene had a sudden image of storms whirling
about his head and floodwaters swirling around his knees while he
just kept striding ahead. &ldquo;Myrelle Sedai,&rdquo; he said with the calm
she should have shown, &ldquo;when ten thousand men or more are shadowing
my backtrail, I want to know what their intentions are. Especially
this particular ten thousand or more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was a dangerous topic. However happy Egwene was
that they were past questions of Talmanes&rsquo; concern over her,
she should have been grinding her teeth that he had mentioned her
at all, but she was so startled she sat bolt upright in her saddle. &ldquo;Ten thousand? Are you sure?&rdquo; The Band had had little more than
half that when Mat brought it to Salidar hunting her and
Elayne.</p>

<p>Bryne merely shrugged. &ldquo;I gather recruits as I go,
and so does he. Not as many, but some men have notions about
serving Aes Sedai.&rdquo; More people than not would have been distinctly
uneasy, saying that to three sisters; he said it with a wry smile. &ldquo;Besides, it seems the Band has a certain reputation from the
fighting in Cairhien. The tale is, <em>Shen an Calhar</em> never
loses, whatever the odds.&rdquo; That was what drove men to join, here as
back in Altara, the thought that two armies must mean a battle.
Trying to stand aside might end as hard as choosing the wrong side;
at best there would be no pickings for neutrals. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a
few deserters to my ranks from Talmanes&rsquo; newlings. Some seem
to think the Band&rsquo;s luck is tied up in Mat Cauthon and
can&rsquo;t be there without him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something close to a sneer twisted Myrelle&rsquo;s
lips. &ldquo;These fool Murandians&rsquo; fears are certainly useful, but
I did not think you were a fool, too. Talmanes follows us because
he fears we might turn against his precious Lord Dragon, but if he
truly intended to attack, don&rsquo;t you think he would have by
now? These Dragonsworn can be dealt with once more important
matters are done. Communicating with him, however&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&rdquo; Giving
herself a shake, she managed to regain her serenity. On the
surface, at least. Her tone could still have scorched wood. &ldquo;You
mark me, Lord Bryne&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene let Myrelle&rsquo;s words pass her by. Bryne
had looked at her when he mentioned Mat. The sisters thought they
knew the situation with the Band, and Mat, and did not think on it
much, but Bryne apparently did. Tilting her head so the brim of her
hat obscured her face, she studied him from the corner of her eye.
He was oath-bound to build the army and lead it until Elaida was
brought down, but why had he sworn? Surely he could have found some
lesser oath, and it surely would have been accepted by sisters who
only thought to use all those soldiers as a Foolday mask to
frighten Elaida. Having him on their side was comforting; even the
other Aes Sedai seemed to feel that. Like her father, he was the
sort of man who made you believe there was no cause for panic
whatever the situation. Having him oppose her, she realized
suddenly, might be as bad as having the Hall against her, and never
mind the army. The one approving comment Siuan had ever had of him
was that he was formidable, even if she did try to change her
remark immediately to mean something else. Any man Siuan Sanche
thought formidable was one to be mindful of.</p>

<p>They splashed across a tiny stream, a rivulet that
barely wet the horses&rsquo; hooves. A bedraggled crow, feeding on a
fish that had stranded itself in water too shallow to swim,
fluttered its tattered wings on the edge of flight, then settled
back to its meal.</p>

<p>Siuan also was studying Bryne&mdash;the mare made
much easier going when she forgot to saw at the reins or dig her
heels in at just the wrong moment. Egwene had asked her about Lord
Bryne&rsquo;s motives, but Siuan&rsquo;s own tangled connection to
the man left her little except acid when it came to him. She either
hated Gareth Bryne to his bootsoles or loved him, and imagining
Siuan in love was like imagining that crow swimming.</p>

<p>The ridgeline where the Band&rsquo;s soldiers had been
showed only cockeyed lines of dead conifers now. She had not
noticed them going. Mat had a reputation as a <em>soldier</em>?
Crows swimming did not come close. She had believed he commanded
only because of Rand, and that had been hard enough to swallow.
<em>Believing because you think you know is dangerous</em>, she
reminded herself, eyeing Bryne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;should be flogged!&rdquo; Myrelle&rsquo;s voice
still burned. &ldquo;I warn you, if I hear that you&rsquo;ve met with this
Dragonsworn again&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rain washing over that boulder as far as Bryne was
concerned, or so it seemed. He rode easily, occasionally murmuring &ldquo;Yes, Myrelle Sedai&rdquo; or &ldquo;No, Myrelle Sedai&rdquo; without any hint of
distress and without lessening the watch he kept on the
countryside. No doubt <em>he</em> had seen the soldiers leave.
However he mustered the patience&mdash;Egwene was sure fear was no
part of it&mdash;she was in no mood to listen to that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, Myrelle! No one is going to do anything to
Lord Bryne.&rdquo; Rubbing her temple, she thought of asking one of the
sisters back in the camp for Healing. Neither Siuan nor Myrelle had
much ability there. Not that Healing would do any good if it was
just lack of sleep and worry. Not that she wanted whispers
spreading that the strain was growing too great for her. Besides,
there were other ways to deal with headaches than Healing, although
not here.</p>

<p>Myrelle&rsquo;s mouth tightened only for an instant.
With a toss of her head, she turned her face away, color in her
cheeks, and Bryne suddenly appeared absorbed in examining a
red-winged hawk wheeling off to their left. Even a brave man could
know when to be discreet. Folding its wings, the hawk plummeted
toward unseen prey behind a stand of bedraggled leatherleafs.
Egwene felt that way, swooping on targets she could not see, hoping
she had chosen the right one, hoping there was a target there.</p>

<p>She drew breath, wishing it were steadier. &ldquo;Just the
same, Lord Bryne, I think it&rsquo;s best you don&rsquo;t meet
Talmanes again. Surely you know as much of his intentions as you
need by this time.&rdquo; Light send Talmanes had not said too much
already. A pity she could not send Siuan or Leane to caution him,
if he would take it, but given feelings among the sisters, she
might as well risk going to see Rand.</p>

<p>Bryne bowed in his saddle. &ldquo;As you command, Mother.&rdquo;
There was no mockery in his tone; there never was. He had obviously
learned to school his voice around Aes Sedai. Siuan hung back,
frowning at him. Perhaps she could dig out where his loyalties lay.
For all her animosity, she spent a great deal of time in his
company, much more than she absolutely had to.</p>

<p>With an effort, Egwene kept her hands on
Daishar&rsquo;s reins, away from her head. &ldquo;How much further, Lord
Bryne?&rdquo; Keeping impatience from her voice was more difficult.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a little way, Mother.&rdquo; For some reason, he
halfway turned his head to look at Myrelle. &ldquo;Not far, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Increasingly, farms dotted the region, as many
clinging to hillsides as on the flats, though the Emond&rsquo;s
Fielder in Egwene said that made no sense, low gray stone houses
and barns, and unfenced pastures with a few slat-ribbed cows and
sad-looking black-tailed sheep. Not all had been burned by far,
only one here and one there. Supposedly the burnings were to let
the others know what would happen if they did not declare for the
Dragon Reborn.</p>

<p>At one farm, she saw some of Lord Bryne&rsquo;s
foragers with a wagon. That they were his was plain as much by the
way he eyed them and nodded as by the lack of a white pennant. The
Band always flaunted itself; aside from the banners, some had of
late taken to wearing a red scarf tied around the arm. Half a dozen
cattle and maybe two dozen sheep lowed and baaed under the guard of
men on horseback, and other men toted sacks from barn to wagon past
a slump-shouldered farmer and his family, a sullen lot in dark
rough woolens. One of the little girls, wearing a deep bonnet like
the others, had her face pressed to her mother&rsquo;s skirts,
apparently crying. Some of the boys had their fists clenched, as if
they wanted to fight. The farmer would be paid, but if he could not
really spare what was taken, if he had had a mind to resist close
on twenty men in breastplates and helmets, those burned farms would
have given him pause. Quite often Bryne&rsquo;s soldiers found
charred corpses in the ruins, men and women and children who had
died trying to get out. Sometimes the doors and windows had been
sealed up from outside.</p>

<p>Egwene wondered whether there was any way to convince
the farmers and villagers that there was a difference between the
brigands and the army. She wanted to, very much, but she did not
see how, short of letting her own soldiers go hungry until they
deserted. If the sisters could see no difference between the
brigands and the Band, there seemed no hope for the country folk.
As the farm dwindled behind them, she resisted the urge to twist
around in her saddle and look back. Looking would change
nothing.</p>

<p>Lord Bryne was as good as his word. Perhaps three or
four miles from the camp&mdash;three or four in a straight line;
twice that over the country they had crossed&mdash;they rounded
the shoulder of a hill spotted with brush and trees, and he drew
rein. The sun stood almost halfway to its crest, now. Another road
ran below, narrower and much more winding than the one through the
camp. &ldquo;They had the idea traveling by night would take them safe
past the bandits,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Not a bad notion, as it turns out, or
else they&rsquo;ve just had the Dark One&rsquo;s own luck.
They&rsquo;ve come from Caemlyn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A merchant train of some fifty large wagons behind
teams of ten or so lay stretched out along the road, halted under
the eyes of more of Bryne&rsquo;s soldiers. A few of the soldiers
were afoot, supervising the transfer of barrels and bags from the
merchants&rsquo; wagons to half a dozen of their own. One woman in a
plain dark dress waved her arms and pointed vigorously to this item
or that, either protesting or bargaining, but her fellows stood in
a glum silent knot. A short way farther up the road, grim fruit
decorated the spreading limbs of an oak, men hanging by the neck
from every bare branch. Bare except for crows, almost enough to
make the tree seem leafed in black. They had larger than fish to
feed on, these birds. Even at a distance it was not a sight to ease
Egwene&rsquo;s head, or her stomach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This what you wanted me to see? The merchants, or
the bandits?&rdquo; She could not see a dress on any of those dangling
corpses, and when the bandits hanged people, they included women
and children. Anyone could have put the corpses there, Bryne&rsquo;s
soldiers, the Band&mdash;that the Band hanged any of the so-called
Dragonsworn they caught made little difference to the sisters&mdash;or even some local lord or lady. Had the Murandian nobles
worked together, all the brigands might have hung from trees by
now, but that was like asking cats to dance. Wait. He had said
Caemlyn. &ldquo;Is it something to do with Rand? Or the
Asha&rsquo;man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This time he looked from her to Myrelle and back
quite openly. Myrelle&rsquo;s hat cast shadows on her face. She
appeared sunk in gloom, sagging in her saddle and not at all the
confident rider she had been earlier. He seemed to reach a
decision. &ldquo;I thought you should hear before anybody else did, but
perhaps I misunderstood&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He eyed Myrelle again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear what, you hairy-eared lump?&rdquo; Siuan growled,
thumping the fat mare closer with her heels.</p>

<p>Egwene made a soothing gesture toward her. &ldquo;Myrelle
can hear anything I do, Lord Bryne. She has my complete trust.&rdquo; The
Green sister&rsquo;s head jerked around. From her stricken look,
anyone would doubt they had heard Egwene correctly, but after a
moment Bryne nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see that matters have&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;changed. Yes, Mother.&rdquo;
Removing his helmet, he set it on the pommel of his saddle. He
still seemed reluctant, picking his words with care. &ldquo;Merchants
carry rumors the way dogs do fleas, and that lot down there has a
fine crop. I don&rsquo;t say any of it is true, of course, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; It was odd, seeing him so hesitant. &ldquo;Mother, one tale that caught
them up on the road is that Rand al&rsquo;Thor has gone to the White
Tower and sworn fealty to Elaida.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Myrelle and Siuan looked much alike,
blood draining from their faces as they envisioned catastrophe.
Myrelle actually swayed in her saddle. For a moment Egwene could
only stare at him. Then she startled herself, and the others, by
bursting out laughing. Daishar danced in surprise, and settling him
on the rocky slope settled her nerves as well. &ldquo;Lord Bryne,&rdquo; she
said, patting the gelding&rsquo;s neck, &ldquo;that isn&rsquo;t so, believe
me. I know it for a fact, as of last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Siuan heaved an instant sigh, and Myrelle was only a
heartbeat behind. Egwene felt like laughing again, at their
expressions. So incredibly relieved they were wide-eyed. Children
who had been told the Shadowman was not under the bed. Aes Sedai
calm indeed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good to hear,&rdquo; Bryne said flatly, &ldquo;but
even if I sent away every man down there, the tale will still reach
my ranks. It will go through the army like wildfire crossing these
hills.&rdquo; That cut her mirth short. That could be disaster, left
alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will have sisters announce the truth to your
soldiers tomorrow. Will six Aes Sedai who know of themselves be
enough? Myrelle, here, and Sheriam. Carlinya and Beonin, Anaiya and
Morvrin.&rdquo; Those sisters would not like having to meet with the Wise
Ones, but they would not be able to refuse her, either. Would not
want to, really, to stop this tale spreading. Should not want to,
at least. Myrelle&rsquo;s tiny wince was followed by a resigned
twist of her mouth.</p>

<p>Leaning an elbow on his helmet, Bryne studied Egwene
and Myrelle. He never so much as peeked at Siuan. His bay stamped a
hoof on the rocks, and a covey of some sort of dove with bright
blue wings whirred into the air from beneath bushes a few paces
away, making Daishar and Myrelle&rsquo;s roan start skittishly.
Bryne&rsquo;s mount did not stir. He had heard of the gateways,
without doubt, though he surely knew nothing of what they were&mdash;Aes Sedai did keep secrets by habit, and had some hope of
keeping that one from Elaida&mdash;and he certainly knew nothing
at all about <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>&mdash;that vital
secret was easier to guard with no manifestations anyone could see&mdash;yet he did not ask how. Perhaps he was accustomed to Aes
Sedai and secrets by now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So long as they say the words straight,&rdquo; he said at
last. &ldquo;If they hedge even a hair&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; His stare was not an
attempt to intimidate, just to drive the point home. He seemed
satisfied by what he saw in her face. &ldquo;You do very well, it
appears, Mother. I wish you continued success. Set your time for
this afternoon, and I will come. We should confer regularly. I will
come whenever you send for me. We should begin making firm plans
how to put you on the Amyrlin Seat once we reach Tar Valon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His tone was guarded&mdash;very likely he still was
not entirely sure what was going on, or how far he could trust
Myrelle&mdash;and it took her a moment to realize what he had
done. It made her breath catch. Maybe she was just becoming too
used to the way Aes Sedai shaded words, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Bryne had just
said the army was hers. She was sure of it. Not the Hall&rsquo;s,
and not Sheriam&rsquo;s; hers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Lord Bryne.&rdquo; That seemed little enough,
especially when his careful nod, his eyes steady on hers, seemed to
confirm her belief. Suddenly she had a thousand more questions.
Most of which she could not ask even were they alone. A pity she
could not take him into her confidence completely. <em>Caution
until you&rsquo;re sure, and then a little more caution</em>. An old
saying that applied very well to any dealings that brushed against
Aes Sedai. And even the best men would talk things over with their
friends, perhaps especially when things were supposed to be secret. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you have a thousand details to see to, what&rsquo;s
left of the morning,&rdquo; she said, gathering her reins. &ldquo;You go on
back. We will ride a little more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bryne protested, of course. He almost sounded like a
Warder, talking of the impossibility of watching every way at once
and how an arrow in the back could kill an Aes Sedai as quickly as
it could anyone else. The next man who told her that, she decided,
was going to pay for it. Three Aes Sedai were surely the equal of
three hundred men. In the end, for all his grumbles and grimaces,
he had no choice but to obey. Donning his helmet, he started his
horse down the uneven slope toward the merchant train, instead of
back the way they had come, but that was even better from her point
of view.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you lead the way, Siuan,&rdquo; she said when he was
a dozen strides below.</p>

<p>Siuan glared after him as though he had been
badgering her the whole time. With a snort, she tugged her straw
hat straight, wheeled her mare around&mdash;well, dragged her
around&mdash;and heeled the stout animal to a walk. Egwene
motioned Myrelle to follow. Like Bryne, the woman had no
choice.</p>

<p>At first Myrelle directed sidelong glances at her,
plainly expecting her to bring up the sisters sent to the White
Tower, plainly gathering excuses for why they had to be kept secret
even from the Hall. The longer Egwene rode in silence, the more
uneasily the other shifted in her saddle. Myrelle began wetting her
lips, fine cracks spreading in that Aes Sedai calm. A <em>very</em>
useful tool, silence.</p>

<p>For a time the only sounds were their horses&rsquo;
hooves and the occasional cry of a bird in the brush, but as
Siuan&rsquo;s direction became clear, angling a little west from the
path back to the camp, Myrelle&rsquo;s shifting increased until she
might have been sitting on nettles. Maybe there was something to
those bits and pieces Siuan had gathered after all.</p>

<p>When Siuan took another turn westward, between two
misshapen hills that bent toward each other, Myrelle drew rein. &ldquo;There&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;There is a waterfall in that direction,&rdquo; she said,
pointing east. &ldquo;Not very large, even before the drought, but quite
pretty even now.&rdquo; Siuan stopped too, looking back with a small
smile.</p>

<p>What could Myrelle be hiding? Egwene was curious.
Glancing at the Green sister, she gave a start at a single bead of
perspiration on the woman&rsquo;s forehead, glistening in the shadow
just at the edge of her wide gray hat. She most certainly wanted to
know what could shake an Aes Sedai enough to make her sweat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think Siuan&rsquo;s way will offer even more
interesting sights, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Egwene said, turning Daishar,
and Myrelle seemed to fold in on herself. &ldquo;Come along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know everything, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Myrelle
muttered unsteadily as they rode between the leaning hills. More
than one drop of sweat decorated her face now. She was shaken to
her core. &ldquo;Everything. How could you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; Suddenly she jerked
upright in her saddle, staring at Siuan&rsquo;s back. &ldquo;Her!
Siuan&rsquo;s been your creature from the beginning!&rdquo; She sounded
almost indignant. &ldquo;How could we have been so blind? But I still
don&rsquo;t understand. We were so circumspect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you want to keep something hidden,&rdquo; Siuan said
contemptuously over her shoulder, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t try to buy coin
peppers this far south.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What in the world were coin peppers? And what were
they talking about? Myrelle shuddered. It was a measure of how
upset she was that Siuan&rsquo;s tone brought no quick snap to put
the other woman in her places. Instead, she licked her lips as
though they were suddenly very dry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, you have to understand why I did it, why we
did it.&rdquo; The frantic edge to her voice was fit for confronting half
the Forsaken, and her in her shift. &ldquo;Not just because Moiraine
asked, not just because she was my friend. I hate letting them die.
I hate it! The bargain we make is hard on us, sometimes, but harder
on them. You must understand. You must!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just when Egwene thought she was about to reveal
everything, Siuan halted her round mare again and faced them.
Egwene could have slapped her. &ldquo;It might go easier with you,
Myrelle, if you lead the rest of the way,&rdquo; she said coldly.
Disgustedly, in fact. &ldquo;Cooperation might mean mitigation. A
little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Myrelle nodded, hands working incessantly on
the reins. &ldquo;Yes, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked on the point of tears as she took the
lead. Siuan, falling in behind, appeared relieved for just an
instant. Egwene thought she herself was going to burst. What
bargain? With whom? Letting who die? And who was &ldquo;we&rdquo;? Sheriam and
the others? But Myrelle would have heard, and exposing her own
ignorance hardly seemed advisable at this point. <em>An ignorant
woman who keeps her mouth shut will be thought wise</em>, the
saying went. And there was another: <em>Keeping the first secret
always means keeping ten more</em>. There was nothing for it but to
follow, holding everything in. Siuan was going to get a talking-to,
though. The woman was <em>not</em> supposed to be keeping secrets
from <em>her</em>. Grinding her teeth, Egwene tried to appear
patient, unconcerned. Wise.</p>

<p>Almost back to the road the camp was on, a few miles
to the west, Myrelle led the way up a low flat-topped hill covered
with pine and leatherleaf. Two huge oaks kept anything else from
growing in the wide depression on the crown. Beneath thick
intertwined branches stood three peaked tents of patched canvas,
and a picket line of horses, with a cart nearby, and five tall
warhorses each carefully picketed away from the others. Nisao
Dachen, in a simply cut bronze-colored riding dress, waited under
the awning in front of one of the tents as if to welcome guests,
with Sarin Hoigan at her side in the olive green coat so many of
the Gaidin wore. A bald-headed stump of a man with a thick black
beard, Nisao&rsquo;s Warder still stood taller than she. A few paces
away, two of Myrelle&rsquo;s three Gaidin warily watched them
descend into the hollow, Croi Makin, slender and yellow-haired, and
Nuhel Dromand, dark and bulky, with a beard that left his upper lip
bare. No one looked surprised in the least. Obviously one of the
Warders had been keeping guard and given warning. Nothing in sight
warranted all the secrecy, though, or Myrelle&rsquo;s lip-licking.
For that matter, if Nisao waited in welcome, why did her hands keep
stroking her divided skirts? She looked as if she would rather face
Elaida while shielded.</p>

<p>Two women peering around a corner of one of the tents
ducked back hurriedly, but not before Egwene recognized them.
Nicola and Areina. Suddenly she felt very uneasy. What had Siuan
brought her to?</p>

<p>Siuan showed no nervousness at all as she dismounted. &ldquo;Bring him out, Myrelle. Now.&rdquo; She was getting her own back with a
vengeance; her tone made a file seem smooth. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late
for hiding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Myrelle barely managed a frown at being addressed so,
and it appeared an effort. Visibly pulling herself together, she
jerked her hat from her head and climbed down without a word,
glided to one of the tents and vanished inside. Nisao&rsquo;s
already big eyes followed her, growing wider by the moment. She
seemed frozen to the spot.</p>

<p>No one but Siuan was near enough to overhear. &ldquo;Why
did you break in?&rdquo; Egwene demanded softly as she got down. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she was about to confess&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;whatever it is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and I still don&rsquo;t have a clue. Coin peppers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very popular in Shienar, and Malkier,&rdquo; Siuan said
just as quietly. &ldquo;I only heard that after I left Aeldene this
morning. I had to make her lead the way; I didn&rsquo;t know it, not
exactly. It would hardly have done much good to let her discover
that, now would it? I didn&rsquo;t know about Nisao, either. I
thought they hardly ever spoke to one another.&rdquo; She glanced at the
Yellow sister and gave her head an irritated shake. A failure to
learn something was a failure Siuan did not tolerate well in
herself. &ldquo;Unless I&rsquo;ve gone blind <em>and</em> stupid, what
these two&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Grimacing as though she had a mouthful of
something rotten, she spluttered trying to find a name to fit.
Abruptly she caught Egwene&rsquo;s sleeve. &ldquo;Here they come. Now
you&rsquo;ll see for yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Myrelle left the tent first, then a man in just boots
and breeches who had to duck low through the doorflaps, a bared
sword in his hand and scars crisscrossing his lightly furred chest.
He was head and shoulders and more taller than her, taller than any
of the other Warders. His long dark hair, held by a braided leather
cord around his temples, was more streaked with gray than when
Egwene has seen him last, but there was nothing at all soft in Lan
Mandragoran. Pieces of the puzzle suddenly clicked into place, yet
it still would not come apart for her. He had been Warder to
Moiraine, the Aes Sedai who had brought her and Rand and the rest
out of the Two Rivers what seemed an Age ago, but Moiraine was dead
killing Lanfear, and Lan had gone missing in Cairhien right after.
Maybe it was all clear to Siuan; to her, it was mostly mud.</p>

<p>Murmuring something to Lan, Myrelle touched his arm.
He flinched slightly, like a nervous horse, but his hard face never
turned from Egwene. Finally, though, he nodded and pivoted on his
heel, strode farther away beneath the branches of the oaks.
Gripping the sword hilt in both hands above his head, blade slanted
down, he rose onto the ball of one booted foot and stood
motionless.</p>

<p>For a moment, Nisao frowned at him as though she,
too, saw a puzzle. Then her gaze met Myrelle&rsquo;s, and together
their eyes swept to Egwene. Instead of coming to her, they went to
each other, exchanging hasty whispers. At least, it was an exchange
at first. Then Nisao merely stood there, shaking her head in
disbelief or denial. &ldquo;You dropped me into this,&rdquo; she groaned aloud
at last. &ldquo;I was a blind fool to listen to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This should be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;interesting,&rdquo; Siuan said as
they finally turned toward her and Egwene. The twist she gave the
word made it sound decidedly unpleasant.</p>

<p>Myrelle and Nisao hurriedly touched hair and dresses
as they crossed the short distance, making certain everything was
in order. Perhaps they had been caught out&mdash;<em>In what?</em>
Egwene wondered&mdash;but apparently they intended to put the best
face they could on matters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will step inside, Mother,&rdquo; Myrelle said,
gesturing to the nearest tent. Only the slightest tremor in her
voice betrayed her cool face. The sweat was gone. Wiped away, of
course, but it had not returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, no, daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some wine punch?&rdquo; Nisao asked with a smile. Hands
clasped at her breast, she looked anxious anyway. &ldquo;Siuan, go tell
Nicola to bring the punch.&rdquo; Siuan did not move, and Nisao blinked
in surprise, her mouth thinning. The smile returned in an instant,
though, and she raised her voice a little. &ldquo;Nicola? Child, bring
the punch. Made with dried blackberries, I fear,&rdquo; she confided to
Egwene, &ldquo;but quite restorative.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want punch,&rdquo; Egwene said curtly. Nicola
emerged from behind the tent, yet she showed no sign of running to
obey. Instead, she stood staring at the four Aes Sedai, chewing her
underlip. Nisao flashed a glare of what could only be called
distaste, but said nothing. Another piece of the puzzle snapped
into place, and Egwene breathed a trifle easier. &ldquo;What I want,
daughter, what I require, is an explanation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Best face or no, it was a thin veneer. Myrelle
stretched out a pleading hand. &ldquo;Mother, Moiraine did not choose me
just because we were friends. Two of my Warders belonged first to
sisters who died. Avar and Nuhel. No sister has saved more than one
in centuries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only became involved because of his mind,&rdquo; Nisao
said hastily. &ldquo;I have some interest in diseases of the mind, and
this must rightly be called one. Myrelle practically dragged me
into it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Smoothing her skirts, Myrelle directed a dark look at
the Yellow that was returned with interest. &ldquo;Mother, when a
Warder&rsquo;s Aes Sedai dies, it is as though he swallows her death
and is consumed by it from the inside. He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that, Myrelle,&rdquo; Egwene broke in sharply.
Siuan and Leane had told her a good bit, though neither knew she
had asked because she wanted to know what to expect with Gawyn. A
poor bargain, Myrelle had called it, and perhaps it was. When a
sister&rsquo;s Warder died, grief enveloped her; she could control
it somewhat, sometimes, hold it in, but sooner or later it gnawed a
way out. However well Siuan managed when others were around, she
still wept alone many nights for her Alric, killed the day she was
deposed. Yet what were even months of tears, compared with death
itself? The stories were full of Warders dying to avenge their Aes
Sedai, and indeed it was very often the case. A man who wanted to
die, a man looking for what could kill him, took risks not even a
Warder could survive. Perhaps the most horrible part of it, to her,
was that they knew. Knew what their fate would be if their Aes
Sedai died, knew what drove them when she did, knew nothing they
did could change it. She could not imagine the courage required to
accept the bargain, knowing.</p>

<p>She stepped aside, so she could see Lan clearly. He
still stood motionless, not even seeming to breathe. Apparently
forgetting the tea, Nicola had seated herself cross-legged on the
ground to watch him. Areina squatted on her heels at Nicola&rsquo;s
side with her braid pulled over her shoulder, staring even more
avidly. Much more avidly, actually, since Nicola sometimes darted
furtive glances at Egwene and the others. The rest of the Warders
made a small cluster, pretending to watch him too while keeping a
close eye on their Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>A more than warm breeze stirred, ruffling the dead
leaves that carpeted the ground, and with shocking suddenness, Lan
was moving, shifting from stance to stance, blade a whirling blur
in his hands. Faster and faster, till he seemed to sprint from one
to the next, yet all as precise as the movements of a clock. She
waited for him to stop, or at least slow, but he did not. Faster.
Areina&rsquo;s mouth slowly dropped open, eyes going wide with awe,
and for that matter, so did Nicola&rsquo;s. They leaned forward,
children watching candy set to dry on the kitchen table. Even the
other Warders really divided their attention between their Aes
Sedai and him now, but in contrast to the two women, they watched a
lion that might charge any moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you are working him hard,&rdquo; Egwene said. That
was part of the method for saving a Warder. Few sisters were
willing to make the attempt, given the rate of failure, and the
cost of it to themselves. Keeping him from risks was another. And
bonding him again; that was the first step. Without doubt Myrelle
had taken care of that little detail. Poor Nynaeve. She might well
strangle Myrelle, when she learned. Then again, she might
countenance anything that kept Lan alive. Maybe. For Lan&rsquo;s
part, he deserved the worst he received, letting himself be bonded
by another woman when he knew Nynaeve was pining for him.</p>

<p>She thought she had kept her voice clear, but
something of what she felt must have crept through, because Myrelle
began trying to explain again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, passing a bond is not that bad. Why, in
point of fact, it&rsquo;s no more than a woman deciding who should
have her husband if she dies, to see he is in the right hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene stared at her so hard that she stepped back,
almost tripping over her skirts. It was only shock, though. Every
time she thought she had heard of the strangest possible custom,
another popped up stranger still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t all Ebou Dari, Myrelle,&rdquo; Siuan said
dryly, &ldquo;and a Warder isn&rsquo;t a husband. For most of us.&rdquo;
Myrelle&rsquo;s head came up defiantly. Some sisters did marry a
Warder, a handful; not many married at all. No one inquired too
closely, but rumor said she had married all three of hers, which
surely violated custom and law even in Ebou Dar. &ldquo;Not that bad, you
say, Myrelle? Not that bad?&rdquo; Siuan&rsquo;s scowl matched her tone;
she sounded as if she had a vile taste in her mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no law against it,&rdquo; Nisao protested. To
Egwene, not Siuan. &ldquo;No law against passing a bond.&rdquo; Siuan received
a frown that should have made her step back and shut her mouth. She
was having none of it, though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the point, is it?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;Even if it hasn&rsquo;t been done in&mdash;what? four hundred
years or more?&mdash;even if customs <em>have</em> changed, you
might have escaped with a few stares and a little censure if all
you and Moiraine had done was pass his bond between you. But he
wasn&rsquo;t asked, was he? He was given no choice. You might as
well have bonded him against his will. In fact, you bloody well
did!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last the puzzle came clear for Egwene. She knew
she should feel the same disgust as Siuan. Aes Sedai put bonding a
man against his will on a level with rape. He had as much chance to
resist as a farmgirl would if a man the size of Lan cornered her in
a barn. If three men the size of Lan did. Sisters had not always
been so particular though&mdash;a thousand years earlier, it would
hardly have been remarked&mdash;and even today an argument could
sometimes be made as to whether a man had actually known what he
was agreeing to. Hypocrisy was a fine art among Aes Sedai
sometimes, like scheming or keeping secrets. The thing was, she
knew he had resisted admitting his love for Nynaeve. Some nonsense
about how he was bound to be killed sooner or later and did not
want to leave her a widow; men always did spout drivel when they
thought they were being logical and practical. Would Nynaeve have
let him walk away unbonded, had she had the chance, whatever he
said? Would she herself let Gawyn? He had said he would accept, yet
if he changed his mind&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?</p>

<p>Nisao&rsquo;s mouth worked, but she could not find the
words she wanted. She glared at Siuan as though it were all her
fault, yet that was nothing alongside the scowl she directed at
Myrelle. &ldquo;I should never have listened to you,&rdquo; she growled. &ldquo;I
must have been <em>mad</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Somehow, Myrelle still managed to maintain a smooth
face, but she wavered a little, as though her knees had gone weak. &ldquo;I did not do it for myself, Mother. You must believe that. It was
to save him. As soon as he is safe, I will pass him on to Nynaeve,
the way Moiraine wanted, just as soon as she&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene flung up a hand, and Myrelle stopped as if she
had clapped it over her mouth. &ldquo;You mean to pass his bond to
Nynaeve?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Myrelle nodded uncertainly, Nisao much more
vigorously. Scowling, Siuan muttered something about doubling a
wrong making it three times as bad. Lan <em>still</em> had not
slowed. Two grasshoppers whirred up from the leaves behind him, and
he spun, sword flicking them out of the air without a pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are your efforts succeeding? Is he any better? How
long have you had him, exactly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only two weeks,&rdquo; Myrelle replied. &ldquo;Today is the
twentieth. Mother, it could require months, and there is no
guarantee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is time to try something different,&rdquo;
Egwene said, more to herself than anyone else. More to convince
herself than for any other reason. In his circumstances, Lan was
hardly an easy present to hand anyone, but bond or no bond, he
belonged to Nynaeve more than he ever would to Myrelle.</p>

<p>When she crossed the hollow to him, though, doubts
sprang up strong. He whirled to face her in his dance, sword
streaking toward her. Someone gasped as the blade halted abruptly
only inches from her head. She was relieved that it had not been
her.</p>

<p>Brilliant blue eyes regarded her intently from
beneath lowered brows, in a face all planes and angles that might
have been carved from stone. Lan lowered his sword slowly. Sweat
coated him, yet he was not even breathing hard. &ldquo;So you are the
Amyrlin now. Myrelle told me they had raised one, but not who. It
seems you and I have a good deal in common.&rdquo; His smile was as cold
as his voice, as cold as his eyes.</p>

<p>Egwene stopped herself from adjusting her stole,
reminding herself that she was Amyrlin and Aes Sedai. She wanted to
embrace <em>saidar</em>. Until this moment, she had not realized
exactly how dangerous he was. &ldquo;Nynaeve is Aes Sedai now, too, Lan.
She&rsquo;s in need of a good Warder.&rdquo; One of the other women made a
noise, but Egwene held her gaze on him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope she finds a hero out of legend.&rdquo; He barked a
laugh. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll need the hero just to face her temper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The laugh convinced her, icy hard as it was. &ldquo;Nynaeve
is in Ebou Dar, Lan. You know what a dangerous city that is. She is
searching for something we need desperately. If the Black Ajah
learns of it, they&rsquo;ll kill her to get it. If the Forsaken find
out&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She had thought his face bleak before, but the pain
that tightened his eyes at Nynaeve&rsquo;s danger confirmed her
plan. Nynaeve, not Myrelle, had the right. &ldquo;I am sending you to
her, to act as her Warder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; Myrelle said urgently behind her.</p>

<p>Egwene flung out a hand to silence her. &ldquo;Nynaeve&rsquo;s safety will be in your hands, Lan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not hesitate. Or even glance at Myrelle. &ldquo;It
will take at least a month to reach Ebou Dar. Areina, saddle
Mandarb!&rdquo; On the point of turning away, he paused, lifting his free
hand as if to touch her stole. &ldquo;I apologize for ever helping you
leave the Two Rivers. You, or Nynaeve.&rdquo; Striding away, he vanished
into the tent he had come out of earlier, but before he had gone
two steps, Myrelle and Nisao and Siuan were all clustered around
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, you don&rsquo;t understand what you are
proposing,&rdquo; Myrelle said breathlessly. &ldquo;You might as well give a
child a lighted lantern to play with in a haybarn. I began readying
Nynaeve as soon as I felt his bond pass to me. I thought I had
time. But she was raised to the shawl in a blink. She isn&rsquo;t
ready to handle him, Mother. Not him, not the way he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With an effort Egwene made herself be patient. They
still did not understand. &ldquo;Myrelle, even if Nynaeve could not
channel a lick&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She could not, actually, unless she was
angry. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that would make no difference, and you know it. Not
in whether she can handle him. There&rsquo;s one thing you
haven&rsquo;t been able to do. Give him a task so important that he
has to stay alive to carry it out.&rdquo; That was the final element.
Supposedly it worked better than the rest. &ldquo;To him, Nynaeve&rsquo;s
safety is that important. He loves her, Myrelle, and she loves
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That explains&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Myrelle began softly, but
Nisao burst out incredulously atop her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, surely not. Not him. She might love him, I
suppose, or think she does, but women have been chasing Lan since
he was a beardless boy. And catching him, for a day or a month. He
was quite a beautiful boy, however hard that might be to believe
now. Still, he does appear to have his attractions.&rdquo; She glanced
sideways at Myrelle, who frowned slightly, tiny spots of color
blooming in her cheeks. She did not react any further, but that was
more than enough. &ldquo;No, Mother. Any woman who thinks she has leashed
Lan Mandragoran will find she has collared only air.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene sighed in spite of herself. Some sisters
believed there was one more part of saving a Warder whose bond was
broken by death; putting him into the arms&mdash;into the bed&mdash;of a woman. No man could focus on death then, the belief
ran. Myrelle, it seemed, had taken care of that herself, too. At
least she had not actually married him, not if she meant to pass
him on. It would be just as well if Nynaeve never found out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be that as it may,&rdquo; she told Nisao absently. Areina
was fastening the girths on Mandarb&rsquo;s saddle with a brisk
competence, the tall black stallion standing with head high but
allowing it. Plainly this was not the first time she had been
around the animal. Nicola stood close by the thick bole of the
farther oak, arms crossed beneath her breasts, staring at Egwene
and the others. She looked ready to run. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what
Areina has squeezed out of you,&rdquo; Egwene said quietly, &ldquo;but the
extra lessons for Nicola stop now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Myrelle and Nisao jumped, mirror images of surprise.
Siuan&rsquo;s eyes grew to the size of teacups, but luckily she
recovered before anyone noticed. &ldquo;You really do know everything,&rdquo;
Myrelle whispered. &ldquo;All Areina wants is to be around Lan. I think
she believes he&rsquo;ll teach her things she can use as a Hunter.
Or maybe that he&rsquo;ll go off on the Hunt with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nicola wants to be another Caraighan,&rdquo; Nisao
muttered caustically. &ldquo;Or another Moiraine. I think she had some
notion she could make Myrelle give Lan&rsquo;s bond to her. Well! At
least we can deal with that pair as they deserve, now that
he&rsquo;s out in the open. Whatever happens to me, it will be a joy
to know they&rsquo;ll be squealing from here to year&rsquo;s
end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Siuan finally realized what had been going on, and
outrage warred on her face with the wondering looks she directed at
Egwene. That someone else had puzzled matters out first probably
upset her as much as Nicola and Areina blackmailing Aes Sedai. Or
perhaps not. Nicola and Areina were not Aes Sedai themselves, after
all. That drastically changed Siuan&rsquo;s view of what was
allowed. But then, it did the same for any sister.</p>

<p>With so many eyes turned her way, and not a friendly
gaze in the lot, Nicola backed up against the oak tree and seemed
to be trying to back up further. Stains on that white dress would put
her in hot water when she returned to the camp. Areina was still
absorbed in Lan&rsquo;s horse, unaware of what was crashing down on
her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be justice,&rdquo; Egwene agreed, &ldquo;but not
unless you two face full justice yourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nobody was looking at Nicola anymore. Myrelle&rsquo;s
eyes filled her face, and Nisao&rsquo;s opened wider yet. Neither
seemed to dare crack her teeth. Siuan wore grim satisfaction like
another skin; by her lights, they deserved no mercy at all. Not
that Egwene intended to give much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will speak further when I come back,&rdquo; she told
them as Lan reappeared, his sword buckled on over a green coat
undone to reveal an unlaced shirt, bulging saddlebags draped over
his shoulder. The color-shifting Warder cloak hanging down his back
wrenched the eye as it swirled behind him.</p>

<p>Leaving the stunned sisters to stew in their own
juices, Egwene went to meet him. Siuan would keep them on a fine
simmer, should they show any sign of falling off. &ldquo;I can have you
in Ebou Dar sooner than a month,&rdquo; she said. He only nodded
impatiently and called for Areina to bring Mandarb. His intensity
was unnerving, an avalanche poised to fall, held back by a
thread.</p>

<p>Weaving a gateway where he had been practicing the
sword, a good eight feet by eight, she stepped through onto what
seemed to be a ferry, floating in darkness that stretched forever.
Skimming required a platform, and though it could be anything you
chose to imagine, every sister seemed to have one she preferred.
For her that was this wooden barge, with stout railings. If she
fell off, she could make another barge beneath her, although where
she came out then would be something of a question, but for anyone
who could not channel, that fall would be as endless as the black
that ran off in every direction. Only at the near end of the barge
was there any light, the gateway giving a constricted view of the
hollow. That light did not penetrate the darkness at all, yet there
was light of a sort. At least, she could see quite clearly, as in
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. Not for the first time she
wondered whether this actually was some part of the World of
Dreams.</p>

<p>Lan followed without needing to be told, leading his
horse. He examined the gateway as he came through, studied the
darkness as his boots and the stallion&rsquo;s hooves thudded across
the deck planks to her. The only question he asked was &ldquo;How quickly
will this take me to Ebou Dar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said, channeling to swing the
gate shut, then closing the gateway. &ldquo;Not right to the city.&rdquo;
Nothing moved that anyone could have seen; there was no wind or
breeze, nothing to feel. They were in motion, though. And fast;
faster than she could imagine anything moving. It must be six
hundred miles or more they had to go. &ldquo;I can put you out five,
maybe six days north of Ebou Dar.&rdquo; She had seen the gateway woven
when Nynaeve and Elayne Traveled south, and she remembered enough
for Skimming to the same place.</p>

<p>He nodded, peering ahead as though he could see their
destination. He reminded her of an arrow in a drawn bow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lan, Nynaeve is staying at the Tarasin Palace, a
guest of Queen Tylin. She might deny she&rsquo;s in any danger.&rdquo;
Which she certainly would, indignantly if Egwene knew Nynaeve, and
rightfully so. &ldquo;Try not to make a point of it&mdash;you know how
stubborn she is&mdash;but you mustn&rsquo;t pay that any mind. If
necessary, just protect her without letting her know.&rdquo; He said
nothing, did not glance at her. She would have had a hundred
questions in his place. &ldquo;Lan, when you find her, you must tell her
that Myrelle will give your bond to her as soon as you three can be
together.&rdquo; She had thought of passing that information along
herself, but it seemed better not to let Nynaeve know he was
coming. She was as besotted with him as&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;as&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>as I am
with Gawyn</em>, she thought ruefully. If Nynaeve knew he was on
his way, there would be little room in her head for anything else.
With the best will in the world, she would let the search fall on
Elayne. Not that she would curl up and daydream, but any searching
she did would be with dazzled eyes. &ldquo;Are you listening to me,
Lan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tarasin Palace,&rdquo; he said in flat voice, without
shifting his gaze. &ldquo;Guest of Queen Tylin. Might deny she&rsquo;s in
danger. Stubborn, as if I didn&rsquo;t know already.&rdquo; He looked at
her then, and she almost wished he had not. She was full of
<em>saidar</em>, full of the warmth and the joy and the power, the
sheer life, but something stark and primal raged in those cold blue
eyes, a denial of life. His eyes were terrifying; that was all
there was to it. &ldquo;I will tell her everything she needs to know. You
see, I listen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She made herself meet his stare without flinching,
but he only turned away again. There was a mark on his neck, a
bruise. It might&mdash;just might&mdash;be a bite. Perhaps she
should caution him, tell him he did not have to be too&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;detailed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;in any explanations about himself and Myrelle. The
thought made her blush. She tried not to see the bruise, but now
she had noticed it, she could not seem to see anything else.
Anyway, he would not be that foolish. You could not expect a man to
be sensible, but even men were not that scatterbrained.</p>

<p>In silence they floated, moving without moving. She
had no fears of the Forsaken suddenly appearing here, or anyone
else. Skimming had its oddities, some of which made for safety, and
privacy. If two sisters wove gateways on the same spot only moments
apart, aiming to Skim to the same place, they would not see one
another, not unless it was <em>exactly</em> the same spot, with the
weaves <em>exactly</em> identical, and neither precision was as
easy to achieve as it might seem.</p>

<p>After a time&mdash;it was hard to tell how long
exactly, but she thought well under half an hour&mdash;the barge
stopped suddenly. Nothing altered in the feel, nor in the weaves
she held. She simply knew that one moment they were speeding
through the blackness, and the next standing still. Opening a
gateway just at the barge&rsquo;s bow&mdash;she was not sure where
one opened at the stern would lead, and not anxious to find out,
frankly; Moghedien had found the very idea frightening&mdash;she
motioned Lan to go ahead. The barge only existed so long as she was
present, another thing like <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>.</p>

<p>He swung back the ferry gate, leading Mandarb out,
and when she followed, he was already in the saddle. She left the
gateway open for her return. Low rolling hills ran off in every
direction, covered in withered grass. There was not a tree to be
seen, nothing more than patches of shriveled scrub brush. The
stallion&rsquo;s hooves kicked up little spurts of dust. The morning
sun in that cloudless sky baked even hotter here than in Murandy.
Long-winged vultures circled over something to the south, and in
another place to the west.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lan,&rdquo; she began, meaning to make sure he understood
what he was to tell Nynaeve, but he forestalled her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five or six days, you said,&rdquo; he said, peering south. &ldquo;I can make it faster. She will be safe, I promise.&rdquo; Mandarb
danced, impatient as his rider, but Lan held him easily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come a very long way since Emond&rsquo;s Field.&rdquo;
Looking down at her, he smiled. Any warmth in it was swallowed by
his eyes. &ldquo;You have a hold on Myrelle and Nisao, now. Don&rsquo;t
let them argue with you again. By your command, Mother. The watch
is not done.&rdquo; With a small bow, he dug in his heels, walking
Mandarb just far enough to put her clear of the dust before setting
the horse to a gallop.</p>

<p>Watching him speed southward, she closed her mouth.
Well. He had noticed in the middle of all that sword practice,
noticed and done the sums correctly. Apparently including sums he
could not have suspected before seeing her with the stole. Nynaeve
had better take care; she always did think men were dimmer than
they actually were.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least they can&rsquo;t get into any real trouble,&rdquo;
she told herself aloud. Lan topped a hill and vanished over the
other side. Had there been any real danger in Ebou Dar, Elayne or
Nynaeve would have said something. They did not meet often&mdash;she just had too much to do&mdash;but they had worked out a way to
leave messages in the Salidar of <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>
whenever there was need for one.</p>

<p>A wind that might have come from an open oven gusted
up sheets of dust. Coughing, she covered her mouth and nose with a
corner of the Amyrlin&rsquo;s striped stole and hurriedly retreated
through the gateway to her ferry. The journey back was silent and
boring, leaving her to worry whether she had done the right thing
sending Lan, whether it was right to keep Nynaeve in the dark.
<em>It&rsquo;s done</em>, she kept telling herself, but that did not
help.</p>

<p>When she stepped once more into the hilltop hollow
beneath the oak trees, Myrelle&rsquo;s third Warder, Avar Hachami,
had joined the others, a hawk-nosed man with thick, gray-streaked
mustaches like down-curving horns. All four Gaidin were hard at
work, the tents down and nearly folded. Nicola and Areina trotted
back and forth loading all the camp paraphernalia into the cart,
everything from blankets to cookpots and black iron wash-kettle.
They really did trot, not pausing, but at least half their
attention was on Siuan and the other two sisters, over near the
treeline. For that matter, the Warders gave the three Aes Sedai
much more than half their consideration. Their ears might as well
have been up in points. Who was simmering who seemed to be a
question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;not speak to me in that manner, Siuan,&rdquo;
Myrelle was saying. Not only loud enough to be heard across the
clearing, but cold enough to take the edge off the weather. Arms
folded tightly beneath her breasts, she was drawn up to every inch
of height, imperious to the point of bursting. &ldquo;Do you hear me? You
will not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you lost to all propriety, Siuan?&rdquo; Nisao&rsquo;s
hands were knotted in her skirts in a vain attempt to keep herself
from quivering, and the heat in her voice easily matched the ice in
Myrelle&rsquo;s. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve forgotten simple manners
completely, you can be taught again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Facing them with her hands on her hips, Siuan moved
her head jerkily, struggling both to keep a glare on her face and
to keep it fixed on the other two. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I am only&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; When
she saw Egwene approaching, her relief bloomed like a flower in
spring. &ldquo;Mother&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; That was almost a gasp. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I was
explaining possible penalties.&rdquo; She drew a long breath, and went on
more definitely. &ldquo;The Hall will have to invent them as they go, of
course, but I think they might well start with making these two
pass their Warders to others, since they seem so fond of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Myrelle squeezed her eyes shut, and Nisao turned to
look at the Warders. Her expression never changed, calm if a touch
flushed, but Sarin stumbled to his feet and took three quick steps
toward her before she raised a hand to stop him. A Warder could
sense his Aes Sedai&rsquo;s presence, her pain, her fear and anger,
every bit as much as Egwene could feel Moghedien&rsquo;s when she
wore the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>. No wonder all the Gaidin moved on
their toes and looked ready to spring at something; they might not
know what had driven their Aes Sedai to the brink of despair, but
they knew the two women were at that brink.</p>

<p>Which was exactly where Egwene wanted them. She did
not like this part of it. All the maneuvering was like a game, but
this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>I do what I must</em>, she thought, unsure whether
that was an attempt to stiffen her backbone or an attempt to excuse
what she was about to do. &ldquo;Siuan, please send Nicola and Areina
back to the camp.&rdquo; What they did not see, they could not tell. &ldquo;We
can&rsquo;t have their tongues flapping, so make sure they know what
will happen to them. Tell them they have one more chance, because
the Amyrlin is feeling merciful, but they&rsquo;ll never get
another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I can manage that much,&rdquo; Siuan replied, and
gathering her skirts, she stalked off. No one could stalk like
Siuan, yet she seemed more eager to be away from Myrelle and Nisao
than anything else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; Nisao said, choosing her words, &ldquo;before you
left, you said something&mdash;indicated there might be some way&mdash;for us to avoid&mdash;some way we might not have to&mdash;&rdquo; She glanced at Sarin again. Myrelle would have been a study in
Aes Sedai serenity as she examined Egwene, except that her fingers
were laced together so tightly that her knuckles strained the thin
leather of her gloves. Egwene motioned them to wait.</p>

<p>Nicola and Areina, turning away from the cart, saw
Siuan coming and went stiff as posts. Which was no wonder,
considering that Siuan advanced as though she intended to walk
right over them <em>and</em> the cart. Areina&rsquo;s head swiveled,
searching, but before she could think to actually run, Siuan&rsquo;s
hands darted out and caught each of them by an ear. What she said
was too low to carry, yet Areina stopped trying to pry her ear
free. Her hands stayed on Siuan&rsquo;s wrist, but she almost seemed
to be using it to hold herself up. A look of such horror oozed
across Nicola&rsquo;s face that Egwene wondered whether Siuan might
be going too far. But then, maybe not, under the circumstances;
they <em>were</em> going to walk free of their crime. A pity she
could not find a way to harness such a talent for ferreting out
what was hidden. A way to harness it safely.</p>

<p>Whatever Siuan said, when she loosed their ears, the
pair immediately turned toward Egwene and dropped into curtsies.
Nicola&rsquo;s was so low it nearly put her face on the ground, and
Areina came close to falling on hers. Siuan clapped hands sharply,
and the two women bounded to their feet, scrambled to untie a pair
of shaggy wagon horses from the picket line. They were astride
bareback and galloping out of the hollow so quickly, it was a
wonder they did not have wings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t even talk in their sleep,&rdquo; Siuan
said sourly when she returned. &ldquo;I can still handle novices and
scoundrels, at least.&rdquo; Her eyes stayed on Egwene&rsquo;s face,
avoiding the other two sisters entirely.</p>

<p>Suppressing a sigh, Egwene turned to Myrelle and
Nisao. She had to do something about Siuan, but first things first.
The Green sister and the Yellow eyed her warily. &ldquo;It is very
simple,&rdquo; she said in a firm voice. &ldquo;Without my protection, you will
very likely lose your Warders, and almost certainly wish you&rsquo;d
been skinned alive by the time the Hall finishes with you. Your own
Ajahs may have a few choice words for you, as well. It may be years
before you can hold your heads up again, years before you
don&rsquo;t have sisters looking over your shoulder every minute.
But why should I protect you from justice? It puts me under an
obligation; you might do the same again, or worse.&rdquo; The Wise Ones
had their part in this, though it was not exactly
<em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m to take on that
responsibility, then you must have an obligation too. I must be
able to trust you utterly, and I can only see one way to do that.&rdquo;
The Wise Ones, and then Faolain and Theodrin. &ldquo;You must swear
fealty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had been frowning, wondering where she was
headed, but wherever they thought, it was not where she ended.
Their faces were a study. Nisao&rsquo;s jaw dropped, and Myrelle
looked as though she had been hit between the eyes with a hammer.
Even Siuan gaped in disbelief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Im-p-possible,&rdquo; Myrelle spluttered. &ldquo;No sister has
ever&mdash;! No Amyrlin has required&mdash;! You can&rsquo;t really
think&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, do be quiet, Myrelle,&rdquo; Nisao snapped. &ldquo;This is
all your fault! I should never have listened&mdash;! Well. Done is
done. And what is, is.&rdquo; Peering at Egwene from beneath lowered
brows, she muttered, &ldquo;You are a dangerous young woman, Mother. A
very dangerous woman. You may break the Tower more than it already
is, before you&rsquo;re done. If I was sure of that, if I had the
courage to do my duty and face whatever comes&mdash;&rdquo; Yet she
knelt smoothly, pressing her lips to the Great Serpent ring on
Egwene&rsquo;s finger. &ldquo;Beneath the Light and by my hope of rebirth
and salvation&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Not the same wording as Faolain and Theodrin,
but every scrap as strong. More. By the Three Oaths, no Aes Sedai
could speak a vow she did not mean. Except the Black Ajah, of
course; it seemed obvious they must have found a way to lie.
Whether either of these women was Black was a problem for another
time, though. Siuan, eyes popping and mouth working without sound,
looked like a fish stranded on a mudbank.</p>

<p>Myrelle tried another protest, but Egwene just thrust
out her right hand with the ring, and Myrelle&rsquo;s knees folded
in jerks. She gave the oath in bitter tones, then looked up. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done what has never been done before, Mother. That is
always dangerous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be the last time,&rdquo; Egwene told her. &ldquo;In fact&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;My first order to you is that you will tell no one
that Siuan is anything but what everybody thinks. My second is, you
will obey any order she gives as if it came from me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their heads turned toward Siuan, faces unruffled. &ldquo;As
you command, Mother,&rdquo; they murmured together. It was Siuan who
looked ready to faint.</p>

<p>She was still staring at nothing when they reached
the road and turned their horses east toward the Aes Sedai camp and
the army. The sun still climbed toward its zenith, still well
short. It had been a morning eventful as most days. Most weeks, for
that matter. Egwene let Daishar amble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Myrelle was right,&rdquo; Siuan mumbled finally. With her
rider&rsquo;s mind elsewhere, the mare moved with something close to
a smooth gait; she actually made Siuan appear a competent rider. &ldquo;Fealty. No one has ever done that. No one. There isn&rsquo;t so
much as a hint in the secret histories. And <em>them</em>, obeying
<em>me</em>. You aren&rsquo;t just changing a few things,
you&rsquo;re rebuilding the boat while sailing a storm!
<em>Everything</em> is changing. And Nicola! In my day, a novice
would have wet herself if she even thought of blackmailing a
sister!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not their first attempt,&rdquo; Egwene told her, relating
the facts in as few words as possible.</p>

<p>She expected Siuan to explode in a fury at the pair,
but instead the woman said, quite calmly, &ldquo;I fear our two
adventurous lasses are about to meet with accidents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Egwene reined in so suddenly that Siuan&rsquo;s
mare ambled another half-dozen paces before she could bring the
animal under control and turn her, all the while muttering
imprecations under her breath. She sat there giving Egwene a
patient look that outdid Lelaine at her worst.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, they have a club over your head, if
they&rsquo;re ever smart enough to think it out. Even if the Hall
doesn&rsquo;t force you into a penance, you can watch any hope you
have with them sail right over the horizon.&rdquo; She shook her head
disgustedly. &ldquo;I knew you would do it when I sent you out&mdash;I
knew you&rsquo;d have to&mdash;but I never thought Elayne and
Nynaeve were witless enough to bring back anyone who knew. Those
two girls deserve all they&rsquo;ll catch if this gets out. But you
can&rsquo;t afford to let it out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing is to happen to Nicola or Areina, Siuan! If
I approve killing them for what they know, who&rsquo;s next? Romanda
and Lelaine, for not agreeing with me? Where does it stop?&rdquo; In a
way, she felt disgusted with herself. Once, she would not have
understood what Siuan meant. It was always better to know than to
be ignorant, but sometimes ignorance was much more comfortable.
Heeling Daishar on, she said, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have a day of victory
spoiled with talk of murder. Myrelle wasn&rsquo;t even the
beginning, Siuan. This morning, Faolain and Theodrin were waiting&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Siuan brought the plump mare in closer to listen as they
rode.</p>

<p>The news did not relieve Siuan&rsquo;s concern over
Nicola and Areina, but Egwene&rsquo;s plans certainly put a sparkle
in her eye and a smile of anticipation on her lips. By the time
they reached the Aes Sedai camp, she was eager to take on her next
task. Which was to tell Sheriam and the rest of Myrelle&rsquo;s
friends that they were expected in the Amyrlin&rsquo;s study at
midday. She could even say quite truthfully that nothing would be
required of them that other sisters had not done before.</p>

<p>For all her talk of victory, Egwene did not feel so
zestful. She barely heard blessings and calls for blessings,
acknowledging them with only a wave of her hand, and was sure she
missed more than she did hear. She could not countenance murder,
but Nicola and Areina would bear watching. <em>Will I ever reach a
place where the difficulties don&rsquo;t keep piling up?</em> she
wondered. Somewhere a victory did not seem to have to be
matched by a new danger.</p>

<p>When she walked into her tent, her mood sank right to
her feet. Her head throbbed. She was beginning to think she should
just stay away from the tent altogether.</p>

<p>Two carefully folded sheets of parchment sat neatly
atop the writing table, each sealed with wax and each bearing the
words &ldquo;Sealed to the Flame.&rdquo; For anyone other than the Amyrlin,
breaking that seal was accounted as serious as assaulting the
Amyrlin&rsquo;s person. She wished she did not have to break them.
There was no doubt in her mind who had written those words.
Unfortunately, she was right.</p>

<p>Romanda suggested&mdash;&rdquo;demanded&rdquo; was a better word&mdash;that the Amyrlin issue an edict &ldquo;Sealed to the Hall,&rdquo; known
only to the Sitters. The sisters were all to be summoned one by
one, and any who refused was to be shielded and confined as a
suspected member of the Black Ajah. What they were to be summoned
for was left rather vague, but Lelaine had more than hinted this
morning. Lelaine&rsquo;s own missive bore her manner all over it,
mother to child, what should be done for Egwene&rsquo;s own good and
everyone&rsquo;s. The edict she wanted was only to be &ldquo;Sealed to the
Ring&rdquo;; any sister could know, and in fact, in this case they would
have to. Mention of the Black Ajah was to be forbidden as fomenting
discord, a serious charge under Tower law, with appropriate
penalties.</p>

<p>Egwene dropped onto her folding chair with a groan,
and of course the legs shifted and nearly deposited her on the
carpet. She could delay and sidestep, but they would keep coming
back with these idiocies. Sooner or later one would introduce her
modest proposal to the Hall, and that would put the fox in the
henyard. Were they blind? Fomenting <em>discord</em>? Lelaine would
have every sister convinced not just that there was a Black Ajah,
but that Egwene was part of it. The stampede of Aes Sedai back to
Tar Valon and Elaida could not be far behind. Romanda just meant to
set off a mutiny. There were six of those hidden in the secret
histories. Half a dozen in more than three thousand years might not
be very many, but each had resulted in an Amyrlin resigning and the
entire Hall as well. Lelaine knew that, and Romanda. Lelaine had
been a Sitter for nearly forty years, with access to all the hidden
records. Before resigning to go into a country retreat, as many
sisters did in age, Romanda had held a chair for the Yellow so long
that some said she had had as much power as any Amyrlin she sat
under. Being chosen to sit a second time was nearly unheard of, but
Romanda was not one to let power reside anywhere outside her own
hands if she could manage.</p>

<p>No, they were not blind; just afraid. Everybody was,
including her, and even Aes Sedai did not always think clearly when
they were afraid. She refolded the pages, wanting to crumple them
up and stamp her feet on them. Her head <em>was</em> going to
burst.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I come in, Mother?&rdquo; Halima Saranov swayed into
the tent without waiting for an answer. The way Halima moved always
drew every male eye from age twelve to two days past the grave, but
then, if she hid herself in a heavy cloak from the shoulders down,
men still would stare. Long black hair, glistening as if she washed
it every day in fresh rainwater, framed a face that made sure of
that. &ldquo;Delana Sedai thought you might want to see this. She&rsquo;s
putting it before the Hall this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Hall was sitting without so much as informing
her? Well, she had been away, but custom if not law said the
Amyrlin must be informed before the Hall <em>could</em> sit. Unless
they were sitting to depose her, anyway. At that moment, she would
almost have taken it as a blessing. She eyed the folded sheet of
paper Halima laid on her table much as she would a poisonous snake.
Not sealed; the newest novice could read it, so far as Delana was
concerned. The declaration that Elaida was a Darkfriend, of course.
Not quite as bad as Romanda or Lelaine, but if she heard the Hall
had broken up in a riot, she would hardly blink.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Halima, I could wish you&rsquo;d gone home when
Cabriana died.&rdquo; Or at least that Delana had had the sense to seal
the woman&rsquo;s information to the Hall. Or even to the Flame.
Instead of telling every sister she could collar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could hardly do that, Mother.&rdquo; Halima&rsquo;s green
eyes flashed with what seemed challenge or defiance, but she only
had two ways to look at anyone, a wide, direct stare that dared and
a lidded gaze that smoldered. Her eyes caused a lot of
misunderstanding. &ldquo;After Cabriana Sedai told me what she&rsquo;d
learned about Elaida? And her plans? Cabriana was my friend, and
friend to you, to all of you opposing Elaida, so I had no choice. I
only thank the Light she mentioned Salidar, so I knew where to
come.&rdquo; She put her hands on a waist as small as Egwene&rsquo;s had
been in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> and tilted her head to
one side, studying Egwene intently. &ldquo;Your brain is hurting again,
isn&rsquo;t it? Cabriana used to have such pains, so bad they made
her toes cramp. She had to soak in hot water till she could bear to
put on clothes. It took days, sometimes. If I hadn&rsquo;t come,
yours could have gotten that bad eventually.&rdquo; Moving around behind
the chair, she began kneading Egwene&rsquo;s scalp. Halima&rsquo;s
fingers possessed a skill that melted pain away. &ldquo;You could hardly
ask another sister for Healing as often as you have these aches.
It&rsquo;s just tightness, anyway. I can feel it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Egwene murmured. She
rather liked the woman, whatever anyone said, and not just for her
talent in smoothing away headaches. Halima was earthy and open, a
country woman however much time she had spent gaining a skim of
city sophistication, balancing respect for the Amyrlin with a sort
of neighborliness in a way Egwene found refreshing. Startling,
sometimes, but enlivening. Even Chesa did not do better, but Chesa
was always the servant, even if friendly, while Halima never showed
the slightest obsequiousness. Yet Egwene really did wish she had
gone back to her home when Cabriana fell from that horse and broke
her neck.</p>

<p>It might have been useful had the sisters accepted
Cabriana&rsquo;s belief that Elaida intended to still half of them
and break the rest, but everyone was sure Halima had garbled that
somehow. It was the Black Ajah they latched on to. Women unused to
being afraid of anything had taken what they had always denied and
terrified themselves half-witless with it. How was she to root the
Darkfriends out without scattering the other sisters like a
frightened covey of quail? How to stop them scattering sooner or
later anyway? Light, how?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think on looseness,&rdquo; Halima said softly. &ldquo;Your face
is loose. Your neck is loose. Your shoulders&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Her voice was
almost hypnotic, a drone that seemed to caress each part of
Egwene&rsquo;s body she wanted to relax.</p>

<p>Some women disliked her just for the way she looked,
of course, as though a particularly lascivious man had dreamed her,
and a good many claimed she flirted with anything in breeches,
which Egwene could not have approved of, but Halima admitted she
liked looking at men. Her worst critics never claimed she had done
more than flirt, and she herself became indignant at the
suggestion. She was no fool&mdash;Egwene had known that at their
first conversation, the day after Logain escaped, when the
headaches had begun&mdash;not at all the brainless flipskirt.
Egwene suspected it was much as with Meri. Halima could not help
her face or her manner. Her smile seemed inviting or teasing
because of the shape of her mouth; she smiled the same at man or
woman or child. It was hardly her fault that people thought she was
flirting when she was only looking. Besides, she had never
mentioned the headaches to anyone. If she had, every Yellow sister
in the camp would be laying siege. That indicated friendship, if
not loyalty.</p>

<p>Egwene&rsquo;s eyes fell on the papers on the writing
table, and her thoughts drifted under Halima&rsquo;s stroking
fingers. Torches ready to be tossed into the haystack. Ten days to
the border of Andor, unless Lord Bryne was willing to push without
knowing why, and no opposition before. Could she hold those torches
back ten days? Southharbor. Northharbor. The keys to Tar Valon. How
could she be sure of Nicola and Areina, short of Siuan&rsquo;s
suggestion? She needed to arrange for every sister to be tested
before they reached Andor. She had the Talent for working with
metals and ores, but it was rare among Aes Sedai. Nicola. Areina.
The Black Ajah.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re tensing again. Stop worrying over the
Hall.&rdquo; Those soothing fingers paused, then began once more. &ldquo;This
would do better tonight, after you&rsquo;ve had a hot bath. I could
work your shoulders and back, everywhere. We haven&rsquo;t tried
that yet. You&rsquo;re stiff as a stake; you should be supple enough
to bend backwards and put your head between your ankles. Mind and
body. One can&rsquo;t be limber without the other. Just put yourself
in my hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene teetered on the brink of sleep. Not a
dreamwalker&rsquo;s sleep; just sleep. How long since she had done
that? The camp would be in an uproar once Delana&rsquo;s proposal
got out, which it would soon enough, and that was before she had to
tell Romanda and Lelaine she had no intention of issuing their
edicts. But there was one thing yet today to look forward to, a
reason to remain awake. &ldquo;That will be nice,&rdquo; she murmured, meaning
more than the promised massage. Long ago she had pledged that one
day she would bring Sheriam to heel, and today was the day. At last
she was beginning to be the Amyrlin, in control. &ldquo;Very nice.&rdquo;</p>
