<h4><em>Into Cairhien</em></h4>

would have set a harder pace than Rand did,
though he knew the horses could not have stood it long. Half the
time they rode at a trot, the other half ran alongside their
animals. Rand seemed unaware of anyone else, except that he always
had a hand for Min if she stumbled. For the rest, he was lost in
some other world, blinking in surprise when he noticed Perrin, or
Loial. Truth to tell, nobody was any better. Dobraine&rsquo;s men
and Havien&rsquo;s stared straight ahead, chewing their own worries
over what they would find. The Two Rivers men had soaked in
Perrin&rsquo;s dark mood. They liked Faile&mdash;truth be told,
some worshipped her&mdash;and if she had been hurt in any way&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Even Aram&rsquo;s eagerness grew bleak once he realized that Faile
might be in danger. Every man focused on the leagues before them,
toward the city ahead. Except for the Asha&rsquo;man, anyway; close
behind Rand like a cluster of ravens, they studied the country the
column crossed, still wary of an ambush. Dashiva slumped in his
saddle like a sack, and muttered darkly to himself when he had to
run; he glared as if he hoped there was an ambush.</p>

<p>Small chance of that. Sulin and a dozen <em>Far
Dareis Mai</em> trotted ahead of the column in Perrin&rsquo;s sight,
with as many more farther ahead, probing the way, and an equal
number on the flanks. Some had thrust their short spears into the
harnesses that held their bow cases on their backs, so the
spearheads bobbed above their heads; the short horn bows were out,
arrows nocked. They kept equally sharp watch for anything that
might threaten the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> and on Rand
himself, as though they suspected he might vanish again. If any
trap waited, any danger approached, they would find it.</p>

<p>Chiad was one of the Maidens with Sulin, a tall woman
with dark reddish hair and gray eyes. Perrin stared at her back,
willing her to drop behind the others and speak to him. Now and
then she spared him a glance, but she avoided him as if he had
three diseases, all catching. Bain was not with the column; most of
the Maidens followed much the same route with Rhuarc and the <em>algai&rsquo;d&rsquo;siswai</em>, but moving more slowly because of
the wagons and prisoners.</p>

<p>Faile&rsquo;s black mare trotted behind Stepper, her
reins tied to his saddle. The Two Rivers men had brought
Swallow from Caemlyn when they joined him before Dumai&rsquo;s
Wells. Every time he looked at the mare prancing along behind him,
his wife&rsquo;s face swelled in his thoughts, her bold nose and
generous mouth, flashing dark eyes tilted above high cheekbones.
She loved the animal, maybe almost as much as she did him. A woman
as proud as she was beautiful, as fiery as she was proud. Davram
Bashere&rsquo;s daughter would not hide, or even hold her tongue,
not for the likes of Colavaere.</p>

<p>Four times they stopped to rest the mounts, and he
ground his teeth at the delay. Taking good care of horses was
second nature to him; he checked Stepper absently, gave the
stallion a little water by rote. Swallow he was more careful with.
If Swallow reached Cairhien safely&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;A notion had planted
itself in his mind. If he brought her mare to Cairhien, Faile would
be all right. It was ludicrous, a boy&rsquo;s fancy, a <em>small</em> boy&rsquo;s <em>foolish</em> fancy, and it would not go
away.</p>

<p>At each of those stops, Min tried to reassure him.
With a bantering grin, she said he looked like death on a winter
morning, just waiting for somebody to shovel his grave full. She
told him if he approached his wife with a face like that, Faile
would slam the door on him. But she had to admit that none of her
viewings promised that Faile was unharmed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light, Perrin,&rdquo; she said at last in exasperated
tones, snugging her gray riding gloves, &ldquo;if anyone tries to harm
the woman, she&rsquo;ll make him wait out in the hall till she has
time for him.&rdquo; He very nearly growled at her. It was not that the
two disliked each other, exactly.</p>

<p>Loial reminded Perrin that Hunters for the Horn could
take care of themselves, that Faile had survived Trollocs
unscathed. &ldquo;She is well, Perrin,&rdquo; he boomed heartily, trotting
beside Stepper with his long axe across his shoulders. &ldquo;I know she
is.&rdquo; But he said the same twenty times, and each time he sounded a
little less hearty.</p>

<p>The Ogier&rsquo;s final attempt at heartening went
further than Loial intended. &ldquo;I am sure Faile can look after
herself, Perrin. She is not like Erith. I can hardly wait for Erith
to make me her husband so I can tend her; I think I&rsquo;d die if
she changed her mind.&rdquo; At the end of that, his mouth remained open,
and his huge eyes popped; ears fluttering, he stumbled over his own
boots and nearly fell. &ldquo;I never meant to say that,&rdquo; he said
hoarsely, striding along beside Perrin&rsquo;s horse once more. His
ears still trembled. &ldquo;I am not sure I want to&mdash;I&rsquo;m too
young to get&mdash;&rdquo; Swallowing hard, he gave Perrin an accusing
look, and spared one for Rand up ahead, too. &ldquo;It is hardly safe to
open your mouth with <em>two ta&rsquo;veren</em> about. Anything at
all might come out!&rdquo; Nothing that might not have come off his
tongue anyway, as he well knew, though it might have happened one
time in a thousand, or a thousand times a thousand, without <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> there. Loial knew that also, and the fact of it
seemed to frighten him as much as anything Perrin had ever seen.
Some considerable time passed before the Ogier&rsquo;s ears stopped
shaking.</p>

<p>Faile filled Perrin&rsquo;s mind, but he was not
blind, not completely. What he at first saw without seeing, as they
rode south and west, began to seep in at the eyes. The weather had
been hot when he headed north from Cairhien, less than two weeks
ago, yet it seemed the Dark One&rsquo;s touch had gained a harder
hold, grinding the land more desperately than before. Brittle grass
crackled beneath the horses&rsquo; hooves, shriveled brown creepers
spiderwebbed rocks on the hillsides, and naked branches, not merely
leafless but dead, cracked when the arid wind gusted. Evergreen
pine and leatherleaf stood brown and yellow often as not.</p>

<p>Farms had begun appearing after a few miles, plain
structures of dark stone laid out in squares, the first in isolated
clearings in the forest, then coming more thickly as the woodland
thinned to trees hardly deserving the name. A cart road straggled
there, running over the shoulders and crests of hills,
accommodating stone-walled fields more than the terrain. Most of
those early farms looked deserted, here a ladderback chair lying on
its side in front of a farmhouse, there a rag doll by the roadside.
Slat-ribbed cattle and lethargic sheep dotted pastures where
frequently ravens squabbled over carcasses; hardly a pasture but
had a carcass or two. Streams ran in trickles down channels of
dried mud. Cropland that should have been blanketed with snow
looked ready to crumble to dust, where it was not dust already,
blowing away.</p>

<p>A tall plume of dust marked the passage of the
column, until the narrow dirt way joined the broad stone-paved road
that led from Jangai Pass. Here there were people, though few, and
those often lethargic, dull-eyed. With the sinking sun almost
halfway down to the horizon now, the air was an oven. The
occasional ox-cart or horse-drawn wagon hurried off the road, down
narrow tracks or even into fields, out of the way. The drivers, and
the handful of farm folk in the open, stood blank-faced as they
watched the three banners pass.</p>

<p>Close to a thousand armed men was reason enough to
stare. A thousand armed men, heading somewhere in a hurry, with a
purpose. Reason enough to stare, and be thankful when they passed
out of sight.</p>

<p>At last, when the sun had less than twice its own
height yet to fall, the road topped a rise, and there two or three
miles before them lay Cairhien. Rand drew rein, and the Maidens,
all together now, dropped to their heels where they were. They kept
those sharp eyes out, though.</p>

<p>Nothing could be seen moving on the nearly treeless
hills around the city, a great mass of gray stone sinking toward
the River Alguenya on the west, square-walled, square-towered and
stark. Ships of all sizes lay anchored in the river, and some tied
to the docks of the far bank, where the granaries were; a few
vessels moved under sail or long sweeps. They gave an impression of
peace and prosperity. With not a cloud in the sky, the light was
sharp, and the huge banners flying from the city&rsquo;s towers
stood plain enough to Perrin when the wind unfurled them. The
scarlet Banner of Light and the white Dragon Banner with its
serpentine creature scaled scarlet and gold, the wavy-rayed Rising
Sun of Cairhien, gold on blue. And a fourth, given equal prominence
with the rest. A silver diamond on a field checked yellow and
red.</p>

<p>Lowering a small looking glass from his eye, a
scowling Dobraine stuffed it into a worked-leather tube tied to his
saddle. &ldquo;I hoped the savages had it wrong somehow, but if House
Saighan flies with the Rising Sun, Colavaere has the throne. She
will have been distributing gifts in the city every day: coin,
food, finery. It is traditional for the Coronation Festival. A
ruler is never more popular than for the week after taking the
throne.&rdquo; He eyed Rand sideways; the strain of speaking straight out
hollowed his face. &ldquo;The commoners could riot if they dislike what
you do. The streets could run with blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Havien&rsquo;s gray gelding danced his rider&rsquo;s
impatience, and the man himself kept looking from Rand to the city
and back. It was not his city; he had made it clear earlier that he
cared little what ran in the streets, so long as his own ruler was
safe.</p>

<p>For long moments Rand studied the city. Or seemed to,
anyway; whatever he saw, his face was bleak. Min studied him,
worriedly, maybe pityingly. &ldquo;I will try to see they don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he
said at last. &ldquo;Flinn, remain here with the soldiers. Min&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She broke in on him sharply. &ldquo;No! I am going where
you go, Rand al&rsquo;Thor. You need me, and you know it.&rdquo; The last
sounded more plea than demand, but when a woman planted her fists
on her hips that way and fixed her eyes to you, she was not
begging.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going, too,&rdquo; Loial added, leaning on his
long-hafted axe. &ldquo;You always manage to do things when I&rsquo;m
somewhere else.&rdquo; His voice took on a plaintive edge. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t
do, Rand. It will not do for the book. How can I write about things
if I am not there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still looking at Min, Rand half-raised a hand toward
her, then let it fall. She met his gaze levelly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;madness.&rdquo; Holding his reins stiffly,
Dashiva booted the plump mare closer to Rand&rsquo;s black.
Reluctance twisted his features; perhaps even Asha&rsquo;man worried
at being too near Rand. &ldquo;All it needs is one man with a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a
bow, or a knife, and you don&rsquo;t see him in time. Send one of
the Asha&rsquo;man to do what needs doing, or more, if you think
it&rsquo;s necessary. A gateway to the palace, and it can be done
before anyone knows what has happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And sit here past dark,&rdquo; Rand cut in, reining his
gelding around to face Dashiva, &ldquo;until they know this place well
enough to open one? That way brings bloodshed for sure.
They&rsquo;ve seen us from the walls, unless they&rsquo;re blind.
Sooner or later they will send somebody to find out who we are, and
how many.&rdquo; The rest of the column remained hidden behind the rise,
and the banners were down there, too, but men sitting their horses
on a ridge with Maidens for company would indeed attract curiosity. &ldquo;I will do this my way.&rdquo; His voice rose in anger, and he smelled of
cold fury. &ldquo;Nobody dies unless it can&rsquo;t be avoided, Dashiva.
I&rsquo;ve had a bellyful of death. Do you understand me?
Nobody!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As my Lord Dragon commands.&rdquo; The fellow inclined his
head, but he sounded sour, and he smelled&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perrin rubbed his nose. The smell&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;skittered,
dodging wildly through fear and hate and anger and a dozen more
emotions almost too quickly to make out. He no longer doubted the
man was mad, however good a face the fellow put on. Perrin no
longer really cared, either. This close&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Digging his heels into Stepper&rsquo;s flanks, he
started for the city and Faile, not waiting for the rest, barely
noticing Aram close behind. He did not have to see Aram to know he
would be there. All he could think of was Faile. If he got Swallow
safely into the city&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He made himself keep Stepper at no more
than a quick walk. A galloping rider drew eyes, and questions, and
delays.</p>

<p>At that pace, the others caught up with Aram and him
fast enough, those who were coming. Min had gotten her way, it
seemed, and so had Loial. The Maidens fanned out ahead, some giving
Perrin sympathetic looks as they trotted by. Chiad studied the
ground until she was beyond him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t like this plan,&rdquo; Havien muttered
on one side of Rand. &ldquo;Forgive me, my Lord Dragon, but I do
not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dobraine, on Rand&rsquo;s other side, grunted. &ldquo;We
have been over that, Mayener. If we did as you want, they would
close the gates on us before we covered a mile.&rdquo; Havien growled
something under his breath and danced his horse a few paces. He had
wanted every man to follow Rand into the city.</p>

<p>Perrin glanced over his shoulder, past the
Asha&rsquo;man. Damer Flinn, recognizable by his coat, and a few of
the Two Rivers men were visible on the ridge, standing and holding
their horses. Perrin sighed. He would not have minded having the
Two Rivers men along. But Rand was probably right, and Dobraine had
backed him up.</p>

<p>A few men could enter where a small army could not.
If the gates were shut, the Aiel would have to besiege the city, if
they still would, and then the killing began anew. Rand had stuffed
the Dragon Scepter into one of the geldings&rsquo; saddlebags so
just the carved butt stuck out, and that plain coat looked like
nothing the Dragon Reborn would wear. For the Asha&rsquo;man, nobody
in the city had any idea what a black coat meant. A few men were
easier to kill than a small army, too, even if most of them could
channel. Perrin had seen an Asha&rsquo;man take a Shaido spear
through his belly, and the man had died no harder than any
other.</p>

<p>Dashiva grumbled under his breath; Perrin caught &ldquo;hero&rdquo; and &ldquo;fool&rdquo; in equally disparaging tones. Without Faile, he
might have agreed. Once Rand peered toward the Aiel encampment
sprawled over the hills two or three miles east of the city, and
Perrin held his breath, but whatever thoughts Rand had, he kept on
the road. Nothing mattered more than Faile. Nothing, whether or not
Rand saw it so.</p>

<p>A good half-mile short of the gates, they rode into
another camp, one that made Perrin frown. It was big enough for a
city itself, a thick band of ramshackle brush huts and rickety
tents made from scraps, on burned-over ground, clinging to the high
gray walls as far as he could see. This had been called Foregate
once, warren of twisting streets and alleys, before the Shaido
burned it. Some of the people stared in silence as the strange
party passed, at an Ogier, and Aiel Maidens, but most scuttled
about their business with wary, sullen faces and a care to notice
nothing that was not right in front of them. The bright colors and
often tattered cast-off finery worn by Foregaters mingled with the
somber garb more usual for Cairhienin, the plain dark clothes of
villagers and farmers. The Foregaters had been in the city when
Perrin left, along with thousands of refugees from deeper inside
the country. Many of those faces bore bruises and worse, cuts and
slashes, often unbandaged. Colavaere must have put them out. They
would not have left the shelter of the walls on their own;
Foregaters and refugees alike feared the return of the Shaido the
way a man who had been seared to the bone feared hot iron.</p>

<p>The road ran straight through the camp to the Jangai
Gates, three tall square arches flanked by towers. Helmeted men
lounged up on the battlements, peering down through the gaps in the
stone teeth. Some stared off toward the men on the hilltop, and
here and there an officer with a <em>con</em> held a looking glass
to his eye. Rand&rsquo;s small party drew inquiring glances. Men
ahorseback and Aiel Maidens; not common companions. Crossbows
showed atop the serrated wall, but no one raised a weapon. The
iron-bound gates stood open. Perrin held his breath. He wanted very
much to gallop for the Sun Palace and Faile.</p>

<p>Just inside the gates sat a squat stone guardhouse,
where strangers to the city were supposed to register before
entering. A square-faced Cairhienin officer watched them pass with
a disgruntled frown, eyeing the Maidens uneasily. He just stood
there, watching.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I told you,&rdquo; Dobraine said once they were by the
guardhouse. &ldquo;Colavaere gave free access to the city for Coronation
Festival. Not even someone under order of arrest can be denied or
detained. It is tradition.&rdquo; He sounded relieved, though. Min sighed
audibly, and Loial let out a breath that could have been heard two
streets over. Perrin&rsquo;s chest was still too tight for sighing.
Swallow was inside Cairhien. Now, if he could only get her to the
Royal Palace.</p>

<p>Up close, Cairhien carried out what it had promised
from afar. The highest of the hills lay inside the walls, but
terraced and faced with stone till they no longer seemed hills at
all. Broad, crowded streets met at right angles. In this city,
even the alleys made a grid. The streets rose and fell reluctantly
with the hills, often simply cutting through. From shops to
palaces, the buildings were all stark squares and severe
rectangles, even the great buttressed towers, each wrapped in
scaffolding on a hilltop, the once-fabled topless towers of
Cairhien, still being rebuilt after burning in the Aiel War. The
city seemed harder than stone, a bruising place, and shadows
stretching across everything heightened the effect. Loial&rsquo;s
tufted ears twitched almost without stopping; a worried frown
creased his forehead, and his dangling eyebrows brushed his
cheek.</p>

<p>There were few signs of Coronation Festival, or High
Chasaline. Perrin had no notion what the Festival might entail, but
in the Two Rivers, the Day of Reflection was a time of merriment
and forgetting the bleakness of winter. Here, a near hush hung in
the air, despite the number of people. Anywhere else, Perrin might
have thought it the unnatural heat dragging people&rsquo;s spirits
down, but except for Foregaters, Cairhienin were a sober, austere
lot. On the surface, at least; what lay underneath, he would as
soon not think about. The hawkers and cart-peddlers he remembered
were gone from the streets, the musicians and tumblers and puppet
shows. Those people would be in the ragtag camp outside the walls.
A few closed, dark-painted sedan chairs threaded through the quiet
throngs, some with House banners a little larger than <em>con</em>
standing stiffly above. They moved as slowly as the ox-carts with
goad-wielding drivers walking alongside, axles squealing in the
stillness. Outlanders stood out, no matter how little color they
wore, because few except outlanders rode. The almost inevitably
shorter natives looked like pale-faced crows in their dark garb.
Aiel stood out too, of course. Whether one alone or ten together,
they walked in clearings through the crowds; eyes darted away and
space just opened up around them wherever they went.</p>

<p>Aiel faces turned toward the party as it made its
slow way through the crowds. Even if not all recognized Rand in his
green coat, they knew who a tall wetlander escorted by Maidens must
be. Those faces sent a chill down Perrin&rsquo;s spine: considering.
They made him thankful Rand had left all of the Aes Sedai behind.
Aside from the Aiel, the Dragon Reborn moved through a river of
unconcern that parted for the Maidens and closed in again behind
the Asha&rsquo;man.</p>

<p>The Royal Palace of Cairhien, the Sun Palace, the
Palace of the Rising Sun in Splendor&mdash;Cairhienin were great
ones for names, each more extravagant than the last&mdash;stood
atop the highest hill in the city, a dark mass of square stone with
stepped towers looming over everything. The street, the Way of the
Crown, became a long broad ramp rising toward the palace, and
Perrin drew a deep breath as they started up. Faile was up there.
She had to be, and safe. Whatever else, she had to be safe. He
touched the knot holding Swallow&rsquo;s reins to a ring on his
pommel, stroked the axe at his waist. The horses&rsquo; shod hooves
rang loudly on the paving stones. The Maidens made no sound at
all.</p>

<p>The guards on the great, open bronze gates watched
their slow approach and exchanged glances. They were colorful for
Cairhienin soldiers, ten men with the Rising Sun in gold on their
dark breastplates and scarves in House Saighan&rsquo;s colors tied
below the heads of their halberds. Perrin could have written out
their thoughts. Thirteen men on horseback, but in no hurry, and
only two wearing armor, one in Mayener red. Any trouble would come
from Caraline Damodred and Toram Riatin, and Mayeners had no place
in that. And there was a woman, and an Ogier. Surely they intended
no trouble. Still, three dozen or so Maidens trotting ahead of the
horses hardly looked as though they were coming for tea. For an
instant all hung balanced. Then a Maiden veiled herself. The guards
jerked as if goosed, and one slanted his halberd and darted for the
gates. Two steps he took, and stopped, rigid as a statue. Every
guard stood stiff; nothing moved but their heads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Rand murmured. &ldquo;Now tie off the flows and
leave them for later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin shrugged uncomfortably. The Asha&rsquo;man had
spread out behind, taking up most of the width of the ramp; they
must be using the Power. Very likely the eight of them could tear
the whole palace apart. Maybe Rand could have by himself. But if
those towers began spewing crossbow bolts, they would die with
everyone else, caught in the open on this ramp that no longer
seemed so wide.</p>

<p>Nobody sped up. Any eyes at the tall narrow windows
of the palace, on the colonnaded walks high above, must see nothing
out of the ordinary. Sulin flashed Maiden hand-talk, and the one
who had veiled lowered the black cloth hurriedly, face flushing. A
slow walk, up the stone ramp. Some of the guards&rsquo; helmeted
heads shook wildly, eyes rolling; one seemed to have fainted,
slumping upright with his chin on his chest. Their mouths strained,
open, but no sound came out. Perrin tried not to think about what
had gagged them. A slow walk, through the open bronze gates, into
the main courtyard.</p>

<p>There were no soldiers here. The stone balconies
around the courtyard stood empty. Liveried servants rushed out with
downcast eyes to take the horses&rsquo; reins and hold stirrups.
Stripes of red and yellow and silver ran down the sleeves of
otherwise dark coats and dresses, and each had the Rising Sun small
on the left breast. That was more color than Perrin had seen on a
Cairhienin servant before. They could not see the guards outside,
and likely would have done little different if they had. In
Cairhien, servants played their own version of <em>Daes
Dae&rsquo;mar</em>, the Game of Houses, but they pretended to ignore
the doings of those above them. Taking too much notice of what
happened among your betters&mdash;or at least, being seen to take
notice&mdash;might mean being caught up in it. In Cairhien, maybe
in most lands, ordinary folk could be crushed unnoticed where the
mighty walked.</p>

<p>A blocky woman led Stepper and Swallow away without
really looking at him. Swallow was inside the Sun Palace, and it
made no difference. He still did not know whether Faile was alive
or dead. A fool boy&rsquo;s fool fancy.</p>

<p>Shifting his axe at his hip, he followed Rand up the
broad gray stairs at the far end of the courtyard, and nodded when
Aram reached over his shoulder again to ease his sword. Liveried
men swung open the great doors at the head of the stairs, bronze
like the outer gates and marked large with the Rising Sun of
Cairhien.</p>

<p>Once, the entry hall would have stunned Perrin with
its grandeur. Thick square columns of dark marble held a
square-vaulted ceiling ten paces above floor tiles that alternated
dark blue and deep gold. Gilded Rising Suns marched around the
cornices, and friezes carved in the walls showed Cairhienin
triumphs in battle. The hall was empty, save for a handful of young
men clustered beneath one of the friezes who fell silent when
Perrin and the rest entered.</p>

<p>Not all men, he realized. All wore swords, but four
of the seven were women, in coats and snug breeches much like
Min&rsquo;s, their hair cut short as the men&rsquo;s. Not that that
was particularly short; men and women alike had it gathered in a
kind of tail that reached their shoulders, tied with a dark ribbon.
One of the women wore green a little paler than normal for
Cairhienin, and another bright blue; all the rest were in dark
colors, with a few bright stripes across their chests. They studied
Rand&rsquo;s party&mdash;with an especial view for himself, Perrin
realized; his yellow eyes took people aback, although he hardly
noticed it anymore unless somebody jumped, or made a commotion&mdash;studied in silence until the last of the Asha&rsquo;man was
in and the doors swung shut. The boom of the closing covered a
moment of fierce whispering; then they came swaggering closer, the
women strutting even more arrogantly than the men, which took some
doing. Even the way they knelt was arrogant.</p>

<p>The green-clad woman glanced at the one in blue, who
had her head down, and said, &ldquo;My Lord Dragon, I am Camaille
Nolaisen. Selande Darengil leads our society&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She blinked at
a fierce look from the woman in blue. Despite the glare, Selande
smelled afraid to her bones, if Perrin was making out who was who
properly. Clearing her throat, Camaille went on, &ldquo;We did not think&mdash;We did not expect you to return&mdash;so soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Rand said softly. &ldquo;I doubt anyone thought I
would return&mdash;so soon. None of you has any reason to be
afraid of me. None at all. If you believe anything, believe that.&rdquo;
Surprisingly, he looked right at Selande when he said that. Her
head whipped up, and as she stared at him, the fear smell faded.
Not completely, but down to a tatter. How had Rand known it was
there? &ldquo;Where is Colavaere?&rdquo; Rand asked.</p>

<p>Camaille opened her mouth, but it was Selande who
answered. &ldquo;In the Grand Hall of the Sun.&rdquo; Her voice grew stronger
as she spoke, the scent of her fear growing weaker. Oddly, a slight
tinge of jealousy touched it once, just for an instant, when she
glanced at Min. Sometimes his sense of smell was more confusing
than enlightening. &ldquo;It is the third Sunset Convocation,&rdquo; she went
on. &ldquo;We are not important enough to attend. Besides, I think we of
the societies make her uneasy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The third,&rdquo; Dobraine muttered. &ldquo;The ninth sunset
after her coronation already. She wasted no time. At least they
will all be together. No one of any rank or pretension will miss
it, Cairhienin or Tairen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drawing herself up on her knees, Selande managed to
make it seem she was meeting Rand eye-to-eye. &ldquo;We are ready to
dance the blades for you, my Lord Dragon.&rdquo; Sulin shook her head,
wincing, and another Maiden groaned audibly; several looked and
smelled ready to do some violence then and there. The Aiel could
not decide what to make of these young wetlanders. The problem in
Aiel eyes were that they were trying to be Aiel, in a way, to
follow <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>, their version of it, anyway.
These seven were not the lot; hundreds of the idiots, at least,
could be found all over the city, organized into societies in
imitation of the Aiel. Half the Aiel Perrin had heard mention them
wanted to help; the other half wanted to strangle them.</p>

<p>For himself, he did not care whether they mangled
<em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em> to mincemeat. &ldquo;Where is my wife?&rdquo; he
demanded. &ldquo;Where is Faile?&rdquo; The young fools exchanged guarded
looks. Guarded!</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is in the Grand Hall of the Sun,&rdquo; Selande said
slowly. &ldquo;She&mdash;she is one of Queen&mdash;of Colavaere&rsquo;s
lady attendants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put your eyes back in your head, Perrin,&rdquo; Min
whispered. &ldquo;She must have a good reason. You know she must.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shrugging inside his coat, Perrin tried to gather
himself. One of Colavaere&rsquo;s <em>attendants</em>? Whatever her
reason, it must be good. That much he was sure of. But what could
it be?</p>

<p>Selande and the others were passing those guarded
looks about again. One of the men, a young fellow with a pointed
nose, whispered fierce and low, &ldquo;We swore not to tell anyone! Not
anyone! On water oath!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before Perrin could demand to be told Rand spoke. &ldquo;Selande, lead the way to the Grand Hall. There will be no blades.
I am here to see justice done, to all who deserve it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something in his voice made Perrin&rsquo;s hackles
rise. A hardness grim as a hammer&rsquo;s face. Faile <em>did</em>
have a good reason. She had to.</p>
