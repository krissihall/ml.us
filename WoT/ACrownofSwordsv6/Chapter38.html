would have gotten out and pulled the coach
himself, if he could. He thought they might have moved faster. The
streets were already full with the sun not all the way up, wagons
and carts wending their way nosily through the crowds and windblown
dust to shouts and curses both from drivers and those forced to get
out of the way. So many barges slid along the canals on the
bargemen&rsquo;s poles that a man almost could have walked the
canals like streets, stepping from one barge to the next. A noisy
hum hung over the gleaming white city. Ebou Dar seemed to be trying
to make up for time lost yesterday, not to mention at High
Chasaline and the Feast of Lights, and well it might, considering
that tomorrow night was the Feast of Embers, with Maddin&rsquo;s
Day, celebrating the founder of Altara, two days after that, and
the Feast of the Half Moon the following night. Southerners had a
reputation for industry, but he thought it was because they had to
work so hard to make up for all the festivals and feastdays. The
wonder was that they had the strength for it.</p>

<p>Eventually the coaches did reach the river, drawing
up at one of the long stone landings that jutted out into the
water, all lined with steps for boarding the boats tied alongside.
Sticking a wedge of dark yellow cheese and a butt end of bread into
his pocket, he stuffed the basket well under the seat. He was
hungry, but someone in the kitchens had been in too much of a
hurry; most of the basket was filled by a clay pot full of oysters,
but the kitchens had forgotten to cook them.</p>

<p>Scrambling down behind Lan, he left Nalesean and
Beslan to help Vanin and the others down from the last coaches.
Nearly a dozen men, and not even the Cairhienin really small, they
had been jammed in like apples in a barrel and clambered out
stiffly. Mat strode ahead of the Warder toward the lead coach, the
<em>ashandarei</em> slanted across his shoulder. Nynaeve and Elayne
were both going to get a piece of his mind no matter who was
listening. Trying to keep Moghedien hidden! Not to mention two of
his men dead! He was going to&mdash;! Suddenly very conscious of
Lan towering behind him like a stone statue with that sword on his
hip, he amended his thoughts. The Daughter-Heir at least was going
to hear about keeping that sort of secret.</p>

<p>Nynaeve was standing on the landing, tying on her
blue-plumed hat and talking back up into the coach when he reached
it. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Will work out, of course, but who would think the Sea
Folk, of all people, would demand such a thing, even just in
private?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Nynaeve,&rdquo; Elayne said as she stepped down with
her green-plumed hat in her hand, &ldquo;if last night was as glorious as
you say, how can you complain about&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was when they became aware of him and Lan. Of
Lan, really. Nynaeve&rsquo;s eyes opened wider and wider, filling
her face as it reddened to shame two sunsets. Maybe three. Elayne
froze with one foot still on the coach step, giving the Warder such
a frown you would have thought he had sneaked up on them. Lan gazed
down at Nynaeve, though, with no more expression than a fence post,
and for all Nynaeve appeared ready to crawl under the coach and
hide, she stared up at Lan as if no one else existed in the world.
Realizing her frown was wasted there, Elayne took her foot off the
step and moved out of the way of Reanne and the two Wise Women who
had shared the coach, Tamarla and a graying Saldaean woman named
Janira, but the Daughter-Heir did not give up; oh, no. She
transferred that scowl to Mat Cauthon, and if it altered a whit, it
was to deepen. He snorted and shook his head. Usually when a woman
was in the wrong, she could find so many things to blame on the
nearest man that he wound up thinking maybe he really was at fault.
In his experience, old memories or new, there were only two times a
woman admitted she was wrong: when she wanted something, and when
it snowed at midsummer.</p>

<p>Nynaeve seized at her braid, but not as if her heart
was in it. Her fingers fumbled and fell away, and she started
wringing her hands instead. &ldquo;Lan,&rdquo; she began unsteadily, &ldquo;you
mustn&rsquo;t think I would talk about&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Warder cut in smoothly, bowing and offering her
his arm. &ldquo;We are in public, Nynaeve. Whatever you want to say in
public, you may. May I escort you to the boat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, nodding so vigorously that her hat
nearly fell off. She straightened it hurriedly with both hands. &ldquo;Yes. In public. You will escort me.&rdquo; Taking his arm, she regained
some measure of composure, at least insofar as her face went.
Gathering her dust-cloak in her free hand, she practically dragged
him across the quay toward the landing.</p>

<p>Mat wondered whether she might be ill. He rather
enjoyed seeing Nynaeve dropped a peg or six, but she hardly ever
let it last two breaths. Aes Sedai could not Heal themselves. Maybe
he should suggest to Elayne that she deal with whatever was wrong
with Nynaeve. He avoided Healing like death or marriage himself,
but it was different for other people as he saw it. First, though,
he had a few choice words to say about secrets.</p>

<p>Opening his mouth, he raised an admonitory finger&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and Elayne poked him in the chest with hers,
her scowl beneath that plumed hat so cold it made his toes hurt. &ldquo;Mistress Corly,&rdquo; she said in the icy voice of a queen pronouncing
judgment, &ldquo;explained to Nynaeve and me the significance of those
red flowers on the basket, which I see you at least have shame
enough to have hidden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His face went redder than Nynaeve&rsquo;s had thought
of. A few paces away, Reanne Corly and the other two were tying on
hats and adjusting dresses the way women did every time they stood
up, sat down or moved three steps. Yet despite giving their
attention to their clothes, they had enough left over for glances
in his direction, and for once they were neither disapproving nor
startled. He had not known the bloody flowers meant anything! <em>Ten</em> sunsets would not have done for his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; Elayne&rsquo;s voice was low, for his ears
alone, but it dripped disgust and contempt. She gave her cloak a
twitch, to keep it from touching him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true! I could not
<em>believe</em> it of you, not even you! I&rsquo;m <em>sure</em>
Nynaeve couldn&rsquo;t. Any promise I made to you is <em>abolished</em>. I will not keep any promise to a man who could <em>force</em> his attentions on a woman, on <em>any</em> woman, but
<em>especially</em> on a Queen who has offered him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Me</em> force <em>my</em> attentions on <em>her</em>!&rdquo; he shouted. Or rather, he tried to shout; choking made
it come out in a wheeze.</p>

<p>Seizing Elayne&rsquo;s shoulders, he pulled her away
from the carriages a little distance. Shirtless dockmen in stained
green leather vests hurried by, carrying sacks on their shoulders
or rolling barrels along the quay, some pushing low barrows loaded
with crates, all giving the coaches a wide berth. The Queen of
Altara might not have much power, but her sigil on a coach door
ensured that commoners would give it room. Nalesean and Beslan were
chatting as they led the Redarms onto the landing, Vanin bringing
up the rear and staring gloomily at the choppy river; he claimed to
have a tender belly when it came to boats. The Wise Women from
both coaches had gathered around Reanne, watching, but they were
not close enough to overhear. He whispered hoarsely just the
same.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You listen to me! That woman won&rsquo;t take no for
an answer; I say no, and she <em>laughs</em> at me. She&rsquo;s
starved me, bullied me, chased me down like a stag! She has more
hands than any six women I ever met. She threatened to have the
serving women undress me if I didn&rsquo;t let her&mdash;&rdquo;
Abruptly, what he was saying hit him. And who he was saying it to.
He managed to close his mouth before he swallowed a fly. He became
very interested in one of the dark metal ravens inlaid in the haft
of the <em>ashandarei</em>, so he would not have to meet her eyes. &ldquo;What I mean to say is, you don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;You have it all backwards.&rdquo; He risked a glance at her under the
edge of his hatbrim.</p>

<p>A faint blush crept into her cheeks, but her face
became solemn as a marble bust. &ldquo;It&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;appears that I may have
misunderstood,&rdquo; she said soberly. &ldquo;That is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;very <em>bad</em>
of Tylin.&rdquo; He thought her lips twitched. &ldquo;Have you considered
practicing different smiles in a mirror, Mat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Startled, he blinked. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard reliably that that is what young women
do who attract the eyes of kings.&rdquo; Something cracked the sobriety
of her voice, and this time her lips definitely twitched. &ldquo;You
might try batting your eyelashes, too.&rdquo; Catching her lower lip with
her teeth, she turned away, shoulders shaking, dust-cloak streaming
behind as she hurried toward the landing. Before she darted beyond
hearing, he heard her chortle something about &ldquo;a taste of his own
medicine.&rdquo; Reanne and the Wise Women scurried in her wake, a flock
of hens following a chick instead of the other way around. The few
bare-chested boatmen up out of their boats stopped coiling lines or
whatever they were doing and bowed their heads respectfully as the
procession went by.</p>

<p>Snatching off his hat, Mat considered throwing it
down and jumping on it. Women! He should have known better than to
expect sympathy. He would like to throttle the bloody
Daughter-Heir. And Nynaeve, too, on general principle. Except, of
course, that he could not. He had made promises. And those dice
were still using his skull for a dice cup. And one of the Forsaken
might be around somewhere. Settling the hat squarely back on his
head, he marched down the landing, brushed past the Wise Women and
caught up to Elayne. She was still trying to fight down giggles,
but every time she cut her eyes his way, the color in her cheeks
renewed itself and so did the giggles.</p>

<p>He stared straight ahead. Bloody women! Bloody
promises. Removing his hat long enough to pull the leather cord
from around his neck, he reluctantly shoved it in her direction.
The silver foxhead dangled beneath his fist. &ldquo;You and Nynaeve will
have to decide which of you wears this. But I want it back when we
leave Ebou Dar. You understand? The moment we leave&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly he realized he was walking alone. Turning,
he found Elayne standing stock still two paces back, staring at him
with Reanne and the rest clustered behind her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Oh. Yes,
I know all about Moghedien.&rdquo; A skinny fellow with red stones on his
brass-hoop earrings, bending over a mooring line, jerked around so
fast at that name that he pitched over the side with a loud yell
and a louder splash. Mat did not care who heard. &ldquo;Trying to keep
her secret&mdash;and two of my men dead!&mdash;after you
promised. Well, we&rsquo;ll talk about that later. I made a promise,
too; I promised to keep the pair of you alive. If Moghedien shows
up, she&rsquo;ll go after you two. Now, here.&rdquo; He pushed the
medallion at her again.</p>

<p>She shook her head slowly in puzzlement, then turned
to murmur to Reanne. Only after the older women were on their way
toward where Nynaeve stood beckoning them at the head of a flight
of boat stairs did Elayne take the foxhead, turning it over in her
fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you have any notion what I would have done to
have this for study?&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;Any notion at all?&rdquo; She
was tall for a woman, but she still had to look up at him. She
might never have seen him before. &ldquo;You are a troublesome man, Mat
Cauthon. Lini would say I was repeating myself, but <em>you</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&rdquo; Expelling her breath, Elayne reached up to pull his hat off
and slip the cord over his head. She actually tucked the foxhead
into his shirt and patted it before handing him his hat. &ldquo;I
won&rsquo;t wear that while Nynaeve doesn&rsquo;t have one, or
Aviendha, and I think they feel the same. You wear it. After all,
you can hardly keep your promise if Moghedien kills you. Not that I
think she&rsquo;s still here. I think she believes she killed
Nynaeve, and I would not be surprised if that was all she came for.
You must be careful, though. Nynaeve says there&rsquo;s a storm
coming, and she doesn&rsquo;t mean this wind. I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; That faint
blush returned to her cheeks. &ldquo;I am sorry I laughed at you.&rdquo; She
cleared her throat, looking away. &ldquo;Sometimes I forget my duty to my
subjects. You are a worthy subject, Matrim Cauthon. I will see that
Nynaeve understands the right of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;of you and Tylin. Perhaps we
can help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he spluttered. &ldquo;I mean, yes. I mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;That
is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Oh, kiss a flaming goat if I know what I mean. I almost
wish you didn&rsquo;t know the truth.&rdquo; Nynaeve and Elayne sitting
down to discuss him with Tylin over tea. Could he ever live that
down? Could he ever again look any of them in the eye afterward?
But if they did not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He was between the wolf and the bear with
nowhere to run. &ldquo;Oh, sheep swallop! Sheep swallop and bloody
buttered onions!&rdquo; He nearly wished she would call him down for his
language the way Nynaeve would, just to change the subject.</p>

<p>Her lips moved silently, and for an instant he had
the strange impression that she was repeating what he had just
said. Of course not. He was seeing things; that was all. Aloud, she
said, &ldquo;I understand.&rdquo; Sounding just as if she did. &ldquo;Come along,
now, Mat. We can&rsquo;t waste time standing in one spot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gaping, he watched her lift skirts and cloak to make
her way along the landing. She understood? She understood, and not
one acid little comment, not one cutting remark? And he was her
subject. Her <em>worthy</em> subject. Fingering the medallion, he
followed. He had been sure the fight would be to ever get it back.
If he lived as long as <em>two</em> Aes Sedai, he still would never
understand women, and noblewomen were purely the worst.</p>

<p>When he reached the steps Elayne had gone down, the
boat&rsquo;s two brass-earringed oarsmen were already using their
long sweeps to push the vessel away. Elayne was herding Reanne and
the last of the Wise Women into the cabin, and Lan stood up in the
bows with Nynaeve. A shout from Beslan called him on to the next
boat, which held all of the men except the Warder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve said there wasn&rsquo;t room for any of us,&rdquo;
Nalesean said as the boat rocked its way out into the Eldar. &ldquo;She
said we&rsquo;d crowd them.&rdquo; Beslan laughed, looking around their
own boat. Vanin sat beside the cabin door with his eyes closed,
trying to pretend he was somewhere else. Harnan and Tad Kandel, an
Andoran despite being as dark as either of the boatmen, had climbed
atop the cabin; the rest of the Redarms hunkered about the deck,
trying to keep out of the way of the rowers. Nobody went into the
cabin, all apparently waiting to see whether Mat and Nalesean and
Beslan wanted it.</p>

<p>Mat put himself beside the tall bowpost, peering
after the other boat, crawling on its sweeps just ahead. The wind
whipped the dark choppy waters, and his scarf as well, and he had
to hold on to his hat. What was Nynaeve up to? The other nine women
on the second boat were all in the cabin, leaving the deck to her
and Lan. They stood up in the bows, Lan with his arms folded,
Nynaeve gesturing as though explaining. Except that Nynaeve seldom
explained anything. Better say never than seldom.</p>

<p>Whatever she was doing, it did not last long. There
were whitecaps out in the bay, where Sea Folk rakers and skimmers
and soarers heaved at their anchors. The river was not so bad, but
the boat still wallowed more than Mat remembered from any previous
trip. Before long, Nynaeve was draped over the railing, losing her
breakfast while Lan held her. That reminded Mat of his own belly;
tucking his hat under his arm so it could not blow away, he pulled
out the wedge of cheese.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beslan, is this storm likely to break before we can
come back from the Rahad?&rdquo; He took a bite of the sharp-tasting
cheese; they had fifty different sorts in Ebou Dar, all good.
Nynaeve was still hanging over the side. How much had the woman
eaten this morning? &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where we&rsquo;ll shelter if
we&rsquo;re caught.&rdquo; He could not think of a single inn he had seen
in the Rahad that he would take the women into.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No storm,&rdquo; Beslan said, seating himself on the
railing. &ldquo;These are the winter trade winds. The trades come twice a
year, in late winter and late summer, but they have to blow much
harder before it comes to storm.&rdquo; He directed a sour look out
toward the bay. &ldquo;Every year those winds bring&mdash;brought&mdash;ships from Tarabon, and Arad Doman. I wonder whether they ever will
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Wheel weaves,&rdquo; Mat began, and choked on a crumb
of cheese. Blood and ashes, he was starting to sound like some
gray-hair resting his aching joints in front of the fireplace.
Worrying about taking the women into a rough inn. A year ago, half
a year, he would have taken them, and laughed when their eyes
popped, laughed at every prim sniff. &ldquo;Well, maybe we&rsquo;ll find
you some fun in the Rahad, anyway. At the least, somebody will try
to cut a purse, or pull Elayne&rsquo;s necklace off.&rdquo; Maybe that was
what he needed to clean the taste of sobriety from his tongue.
Sobriety. Light, what a word to apply to Mat Cauthon! Tylin must be
scaring him more than he thought, if he was shriveling up this way.
Maybe he needed some of Beslan&rsquo;s sort of fun. That was crazy&mdash;he had never seen the fight he would not rather walk around&mdash;but maybe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beslan shook his head. &ldquo;If anyone can find it, you
can, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;We&rsquo;ll be with seven Wise Women, Mat. Seven.
With just one at your side, you could slap a man, even in the
Rahad, and he would swallow his tongue and walk away. And the
women. What&rsquo;s the fun of kissing a woman without the risk
she&rsquo;ll decide to stick a knife in you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn my soul,&rdquo; Nalesean muttered into his beard. &ldquo;It
sounds as though I&rsquo;ve dragged myself from bed for a dull
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beslan nodded in commiseration. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re lucky,
though&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The Civil Guard does send patrols to the Rahad
occasionally, and if they&rsquo;re after smugglers, they always
dress like anyone else. They seem to think nobody will notice a
dozen or so men together carrying swords, whatever they wear, and
they&rsquo;re always surprised when the smugglers ambush them, which
is what nearly always happens. If Mat&rsquo;s <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>
luck works for us, we might be taken for the Civil Guard, and some
smugglers might attack us before they see the red belts.&rdquo; Nalesean
brightened and began rubbing his hands together.</p>

<p>Mat glared at them. Maybe Beslan&rsquo;s sort of fun
was not what he needed. For one thing, he had more than enough of
women with knives. Nynaeve still hung over the side of the boat
ahead; that would teach her to gorge herself. Wolfing down the last
of the cheese, he began on the bread and tried to ignore the dice
in his head. An easy trip with no trouble did not sound bad at all.
A quick trip, with a quick departure from Ebou Dar.</p>

<p>The Rahad was everything he remembered, and
everything Beslan feared. The wind made climbing the cracked gray
stone steps at the boat landing into a perilous feat, and after
that, it grew worse. Canals ran everywhere, just as across the
river, but here the bridges were plain, the grimy stone parapets
broken and crumbling; half the canals were so silted that boys
waded waist-deep in them, and hardly a barge was to be seen. Tall
buildings stood crowded together, blocky structures with scabrous
once-white plaster gone in huge patches to reveal rotting red
brick, bordering narrow streets with broken paving stones. In those
streets where even the fragments had not been ripped up. Morning
did not really reach into the shadows of the buildings. Dingy
laundry hung drying from every third window, except where a
structure stood empty. Some did, and those windows gaped liked eye
sockets in a skull. A sour-sweet smell of decay permeated the air,
last month&rsquo;s chamber pots and ancient refuse moldering
wherever it had been flung, and for every fly on the other side of
the Eldar, a hundred buzzed here in clouds of green and blue. He
spotted the peeling blue door of The Golden Crown of Heaven and
shuddered at the thought of taking the women in there if the storm
broke, despite what Beslan said. Then he shuddered again for having
shuddered. Something was happening to him, and he did not like
it.</p>

<p>Nynaeve and Elayne insisted on taking the lead, with
Reanne between them and the Wise Women close behind. Lan stayed at
Nynaeve&rsquo;s shoulder like a wolfhound, hand on sword hilt, eyes
constantly searching, radiating menace. In truth, he was probably
enough protection for two dozen pretty sixteen-year-old girls
carrying sacks of gold, even here, but Mat insisted that Vanin and
the rest keep their eyes open. In fact, the former horsethief and
poacher kept so close to Elayne that anyone could have been
forgiven for thinking he was her Warder, if a rather fat and
rumpled one. Beslan rolled his eyes expressively at Mat&rsquo;s
instructions, and Nalesean irritably stroked his beard and muttered
that he could still be in bed.</p>

<p>Men strutted arrogantly along the streets with often
ragged vests and no shirts, wearing great brass hoops in their ears
and brass finger rings set with colored glass, one knife or
sometimes two stuck behind their belts. Hands hovering near those
knives, they stared as though daring someone to give the wrong
twist to a look. Others skulked from corner to corner, doorway to
doorway with hooded eyes, imitating the slat-ribbed dogs that
sometimes snarled from a dark alleyway barely wide enough for a man
to squeeze into. Those men hunched over their knives, and there was
no way to tell which would run and which stab. By and large, the
women made any of the men appear humble, parading in worn dresses
and twice as much brass jewelry as the men. They carried knives
too, of course, and their bold dark eyes sent ten sorts of
challenge in every glance. In short, the Rahad was the sort of
place where anyone wearing silk could hardly hope to walk ten steps
without being cracked over the head. After which they had best hope
to wake stripped to the skin and tossed onto a pile of rubbish in
an alley, since the alternative was not to wake at all. But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Children darted from every second door with chipped
pottery cups of water, sent by their mothers in case the Wise Women
wished a drink. Men with scarred faces and murder etched into their
eyes stared openmouthed at seven Wise Women together, then bobbed
jerky bows and inquired politely if they could be of assistance,
was there anything that required carrying? Women, sometimes with as
many scars and always eyes to make Tylin flinch, curtsied awkwardly
and breathlessly asked whether they might supply directions, had
anyone made a bother of themselves to bring so many Wise Women? If
so, the strong implication was, Tamarla and the rest had no need of
troubling themselves if they would just supply the name.</p>

<p>Oh, they glared at the soldiers as hotly as ever,
though even the hardest flinched away from Lan after a single look.
And, oddly enough, from Vanin. A few of the men growled at Beslan
and Nalesean whenever they gazed too long at a woman&rsquo;s deep
neckline. Some growled at Mat, though he could not understand why;
unlike those two, he was never in danger of his eyeballs falling
down the front of a woman&rsquo;s dress. He knew how to look
discreetly. Nynaeve and Elayne were ignored, for all their finery,
and so was Reanne in her red wool dress; they did not have the red
belt. But they did have the protection of those belts. Mat realized
that Beslan had been right. He could empty his purse on the ground,
and no one would pick up a copper, at least so long as the Wise
Women remained. He could pinch the bottom of every woman in sight,
and even if she had apoplexy, she would walk away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a pleasant walk,&rdquo; Nalesean said dryly, &ldquo;with
such interesting sights and smells. Did I tell you I didn&rsquo;t
get much sleep last night, Mat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want to die in bed?&rdquo; Mat grumbled. They might
as well all have stayed in bed; they were bloody useless here, that
was for sure. The Tairen snorted indignantly. Beslan laughed, but he
probably thought Mat meant something else.</p>

<p>Across the Rahad they marched, until Reanne finally
stopped in front of a building exactly like every other, all
flaking plaster and crumbling brick, the same Mat had followed
another woman to yesterday. No laundry hung from these windows;
only rats lived in there. &ldquo;In here,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s eyes climbed slowly to the flat roof. &ldquo;Six,&rdquo; she murmured in tones of great satisfaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Six,&rdquo; Nynaeve sighed, and Elayne patted her arm as
though sympathizing with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t really sure,&rdquo; she said. So Nynaeve
smiled and patted <em>her</em>. Mat did not understand a word of
it. So the building had six floors. Women behaved very strangely
sometimes. Well, most of the time.</p>

<p>Inside, a long hallway carpeted with dust ran dimly
to the back, the far end lost in shadows. Few of the doorways held
doors, and those were rough planks. One opening, almost a third of
the way down the hall, led to a narrow flight of steep stone-faced
steps climbing upward. That was the way he had gone the day before,
following footprints in the dust, but he thought some of those
other openings must be crossing corridors. He had not taken time to
look around then, but the building was too deep and too wide for
this floor to be served by only the one they saw. It was too big
for only one way in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, Mat,&rdquo; Nynaeve said when he told off Harnan
and half the Redarms to find any back way in and guard it. Lan kept
so close to her side, he might have been glued there. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you see by now there&rsquo;s no need?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her tone was so mild that Elayne must have passed on
the truth about Tylin, but if anything, that only soured his mood
further. He did not want <em>anyone</em> to know. Bloody useless!
But those dice were still rattling around in his head. &ldquo;Maybe
Moghedien likes back doors,&rdquo; he said dryly. Something cluttered in
the dark end of the hall, and one of the men with Harnan cursed
loudly about rats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You told him,&rdquo; Nynaeve breathed furiously at Lan,
one hand snapping shut on her braid.</p>

<p>Elayne made an exasperated sound. &ldquo;This is no time to
stop for an argument, Nynaeve. The Bowl is upstairs! The Bowl of
the Winds!&rdquo; A small ball of light suddenly appeared, floating in
front of her, and without waiting to see whether or not Nynaeve was
coming, she gathered her skirts and darted up the stairs. Vanin
dashed after her with a startling turn of speed for his bulk,
followed by Reanne and most of the Wise Women. Round-faced Sumeko
and Ieine, tall and dark and pretty despite the lines at the
corners of her eyes, hesitated, then remained with Nynaeve.</p>

<p>Mat would have gone, too, if Nynaeve and Lan had not
been in his way. &ldquo;Would you let me by, Nynaeve?&rdquo; he asked. He
deserved to be there, at least, when this fabulous bloody Bowl was
uncovered. &ldquo;Nynaeve?&rdquo; She was so focused on Lan she seemed to have
forgotten anyone else. Mat exchanged glances with Beslan, who
grinned and squatted easily with Corevin and the remaining Redarms.
Nalesean leaned against the wall and yawned ostentatiously. Which
was a mistake with all that dust about; the yawn turned into a
coughing fit that darkened his face and doubled him over.</p>

<p>Even that did not distract Nynaeve. Carefully, she
took her hand away from her braid. &ldquo;I am not angry, Lan,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are,&rdquo; he replied calmly. &ldquo;But he had to be
told.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve?&rdquo; Mat said. &ldquo;Lan?&rdquo; Neither one so much as
flickered an eye his way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would have told him when I was ready, Lan
Mandragoran!&rdquo; Her mouth clamped shut, but her lips writhed as
though she were talking to herself. &ldquo;I will not be angry with you,&rdquo;
she went on in a much milder tone, and that sounded addressed to
herself as well. Very deliberately she tossed her braid back over
her shoulder, jerked that blue-plumed hat straight, and clasped her
hands at her waist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you say so,&rdquo; Lan said mildly.</p>

<p>Nynaeve quivered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you take that tone with
me!&rdquo; she shouted. &ldquo;I tell you, I&rsquo;m not angry! Do you hear
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blood and ashes, Nynaeve,&rdquo; Mat growled. &ldquo;He
doesn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re angry. I don&rsquo;t think
you&rsquo;re angry.&rdquo; A good thing women had taught him to lie with a
straight face. &ldquo;Now could we go upstairs and fetch this bloody Bowl
of the Winds?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A marvelous idea,&rdquo; said a woman&rsquo;s voice from
the door to the street. &ldquo;Shall we go up together and surprise
Elayne?&rdquo; Mat had never seen the two women who walked into the hall
before, but their faces were Aes Sedai faces. The speaker&rsquo;s
was long and cold as her voice, her companion&rsquo;s framed by
scores of thin dark braids worked with colored beads. Nearly two
dozen men crowded in behind them, bulky fellows with heavy
shoulders, clubs and knives in hand. Mat shifted his grip on the
<em>ashandarei</em>; he knew trouble when he saw it, and the
foxhead on his chest was cool, almost cold against his skin.
Somebody was holding the One Power.</p>

<p>The two Wise Women nearly fell over dropping curtsies
as soon as they saw those ageless features, but Nynaeve certainly
knew trouble, too. Her mouth worked soundlessly as the pair came
down the hallway, her face all consternation and
self-recrimination. Behind him, Mat heard a sword leaving its
scabbard, but he was not about to look back to see whose. Lan just
stood there, which meant of course that he looked like a leopard
ready to pounce.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re Black Ajah,&rdquo; Nynaeve said at last. Her
voice started faint and gained strength, as she went on. &ldquo;Falion
Bhoda and Ispan Shefar. They committed murder in the Tower, and
worse since. They&rsquo;re Darkfriends, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Her voice
faltered for an instant &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;they have me shielded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The newcomers continued to advance serenely. &ldquo;Have
you ever heard such nonsense, Ispan?&rdquo; the long-faced Aes Sedai
asked her companion, who stopped grimacing at the dust long enough
to smirk at Nynaeve. &ldquo;Ispan and I come from the White Tower, while
Nynaeve and her friends are rebels against the Amyrlin Seat.
They&rsquo;ll be punished severely for that, and so will anyone who
helps them.&rdquo; With a shock, Mat realized the woman did not know; she
thought that he and Lan and the others were just hired strongarms.
Falion directed a smile at Nynaeve; it made a blizzard warm by
comparison. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s someone who will be overjoyed to see you
when we take you back, Nynaeve. She thinks you are dead. Better the
rest of you go now. You don&rsquo;t want to meddle in Aes Sedai
affairs. My men will see you to the river.&rdquo; Without taking her eyes
from Nynaeve, Falion motioned for the men behind her to come
forward.</p>

<p>Lan moved. He did not draw his sword, and against Aes
Sedai he should have had no chance if he had, no chance in any
case, but one moment he was standing still and the next he had
thrown himself at the pair. Just before he struck, he grunted as
though hit hard, but he crashed into them, carrying both Black
sisters to the dusty floor. That opened the sluicegates wide.</p>

<p>Lan pushed himself to hands and knees, shaking his
head groggily, and one of the bulky fellows raised an iron-strapped
club to smash his skull. Mat stabbed the fellow in the belly with
his spear as Beslan and Nalesean and the five Redarms rushed to
meet the Darkfriends&rsquo; shouting charge. Lan staggered to his
feet, sword sweeping out to open a Darkfriend from crotch to neck.
There was not much room to work sword or <em>ashandarei</em> in the
corridor, but the tight quarters were what allowed them to face
odds of two to one or worse without being overcome in the first
moment. Grunting men struggled with them face-to-face, elbowing
each other for room to stab or swing a club at them.</p>

<p>Small spaces remained clear around the Black sisters,
and around Nynaeve; they saw to that themselves. A wiry Andoran
Redarm almost bumped into Falion, but at the last instant he jerked
into the air and flew across the hallway, knocking down two of the
heavy-shouldered Darkfriends in his flight before smacking into the
wall and sliding down, the back of his head leaving a bloody smear
on the cracked, dusty plaster. A bald headed Darkfriend squeezed
through the line of defenders and rushed at Nynaeve with
out-stretched knife; he yelled as his feet were suddenly jerked
back from him, a yell that cut off when his face hit the floor so
hard that his head bounced.</p>

<p>Obviously Nynaeve was no longer shielded, and if the
chilly silver foxhead sliding around Mat&rsquo;s chest as he fought
was not enough indication that she and the Black sisters were in
some sort of struggle, the way they glared at her and she at them,
ignoring the battle around them, shouted the fact. The two Wise
Women looked on in horror; they had their curved knives in their
fists, but they huddled against the wall, staring from Nynaeve to
the other two with eyes wide and mouths hanging open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fight,&rdquo; Nynaeve snapped at them. She turned her head
just a fraction, so she could see them as well as Falion and Ispan. &ldquo;I cannot do it alone; they&rsquo;re linked. If you don&rsquo;t fight
them, they will kill you. You know about them, now!&rdquo; The Wise Women
gaped at her as though she had suggested spitting in the
Queen&rsquo;s face. In the midst of shouts and grants, Ispan laughed
melodiously. In the midst of shouts and grants, a shrill scream
echoed down the stairs.</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s head swung that way. Suddenly she
staggered, and her head swung back like a wounded badger&rsquo;s,
with a scowl that should have made Falion and Ispan leave right
then if they had any sense. Nynaeve spared an agonized glance for
Mat, though. &ldquo;There was channeling upstairs,&rdquo; she said through her
teeth. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat hesitated. More likely, Elayne had seen a rat.
More likely&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He managed to knock aside a dagger thrust at his
ribs, but there was no room to stab back with the <em>ashandarei</em> or use the haft like a quarterstaff. Beslan stabbed
past him and took his attacker through the heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, Mat,&rdquo; Nynaeve said tightly. She never
begged. She would cut her own throat first. &ldquo;Please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a curse, Mat pulled himself out of the fight and
dashed up the steep, narrow stairs, taking all six flights in the
dark stairwell at a dead ran. There was not a single window to give
light. If it was just a rat, he was going to shake Elayne till her
teeth&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He burst out onto the top floor, not much brighter than
the stairwell with only one window at the street end, burst into a
scene from nightmare.</p>

<p>Women lay sprawled everywhere. Elayne was one, half
on her back against the wall, eyes closed. Vanin crouched on his
knees, blood streaming from nose and ears, feebly trying to pull
himself up against the wall. The last woman on her feet, Janira,
fled toward Mat as soon as she saw him. He had thought of her as a
hawk, with her hooked beak of a nose and sharp cheekbones, but her
face was pure terror now, those dark eyes wide and stark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help me!&rdquo; she screamed at him, and a man caught her
from behind. He was an ordinary-looking fellow, maybe a little
older than Mat, of the same height and slender in a plain gray
coat. Smiling, he took Janira&rsquo;s head between his hands and
twisted sharply. The sound of her neck breaking was like a dry
branch snapping. He let her drop in a boneless heap and gazed down
at her. For a moment, his smile looked&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;rapturous.</p>

<p>By the light of a pair of lanterns, a small knot of
men just beyond Vanin were prying open a door to the squeal of
rusted hinges, but Mat hardly noticed. His eyes went from
Janira&rsquo;s crumpled corpse to Elayne. He had promised to keep
her safe for Rand. He had promised. With a cry, he launched himself
at the killer, <em>ashandarei</em> extended.</p>

<p>Mat had seen Myrddraal move, but this fellow was
quicker, hard as that was to believe. He just seemed to flow from
in front of the spear, and, seizing the haft, he pivoted, flinging
Mat past him five paces down the hall.</p>

<p>Breath left when he hit the floor in a small cloud of
dust. So did the <em>ashandarei</em>. Straggling for air, he pushed
himself up, foxhead dangling from his open shirt. Dragging a knife
from under his coat, he flung himself at the man again just as
Nalesean appeared at the head of the stairs, sword in hand. Now
they had him, however quick he&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The man made a Myrddraal seem stiff. He slid around
Nalesean&rsquo;s thrust as though there was not a bone in his body,
right hand shooting out to seize Nalesean&rsquo;s throat. His hand
came away with a liquid, ripping sound. Blood fountained past
Nalesean&rsquo;s beard. His sword dropped, ringing on the dusty
stone floor, and he clutched both hands to his ruined neck, red
running through his fingers as he fell.</p>

<p>Mat crashed into the killer&rsquo;s back, and they all
three hit the floor together. He had no compunctions against
stabbing a man in the back when it was necessary, especially a man
who could tear somebody&rsquo;s throat out. He should have let
Nalesean stay in bed. The thought came sadly as he drove the blade
home hard, then a second time, a third.</p>

<p>The man twisted in his grip. It should not have been
possible, but somehow the fellow rolled over beneath him, pulling
the knife hilt out of his hand. Nalesean&rsquo;s staring eyes and
bloody throat were a reminder right before his eyes. Desperately he
grabbed the man&rsquo;s wrists, one hand slipping a little in the
blood that ran down the fellow&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>The man smiled at him. With a knife sticking out of
his side, he smiled! &ldquo;He wants you dead as much as he wants her,&rdquo;
he said softly. And as if Mat was not holding him at all, his hands
moved toward Mat&rsquo;s head, driving Mat&rsquo;s arms back.</p>

<p>Mat pushed frantically, threw all of his weight
against the fellow&rsquo;s arms to no avail. Light, he might as well
have been a child fighting a grown man. The fellow was making a
game of it, taking his bloody time. Hands touched his head. Where
was his flaming luck? He gave a heave with what seemed his last
strength&mdash;and the medallion fell against the man&rsquo;s
cheek. The man screamed. Smoke rose around the edges of the
foxhead, and a sizzle like bacon frying. Convulsively, he hurled
Mat away with hands and feet both. This time, Mat flew ten paces
and slid.</p>

<p>When he scrambled to his feet, half-dazed, the man
was already up, hands trembling at his face. A raw red brand marked
where the foxhead had fallen. Gingerly, Mat fingered the medallion.
It was cool. Not the cool of someone channeling nearby&mdash;maybe
they were still at it below, but that was too far off&mdash;just
the cool of silver. He had no notion what this fellow was, except
that he certainly was not human, but between that burn and three
stab wounds, with the knife hilt still jutting out beneath his arm,
he had to be slowed enough for Mat to get past him to the stairs.
Avenging Elayne was all very well, and Nalesean too, but it was not
going to happen today, apparently, and there was no call to supply
a reason for avenging Mat Cauthon.</p>

<p>Jerking the knife out of his side, the man hurled it
at him. Mat snagged it out of the air without thinking. Thom had
taught him to juggle, and Thom said he had the quickest hands he
had ever seen. Ripping the knife around so he held it properly,
pointed slanted up, he noticed the gleaming blade, and his heart
sank. No blood. There should have been at least a smear of red, but
the steel shone, bright and clean. Maybe even three stab wounds
were not going to slow this&mdash;whatever he was.</p>

<p>He risked a glance over his shoulder. The other men
were streaming out of that door they had pried open, the door those
footprints had led him to yesterday, but their arms seemed full of
rubbish, small half-rotted chests, a cask with cloth-wrapped
objects bulging through missing staves, even a broken chair and a
cracked mirror. They must have had orders to take everything.
Paying no attention whatever to Mat, they hurried toward the far
end of the hall and vanished around a corner. There had to be
another set of stairs back there. Maybe he could follow them down
at a distance. Maybe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Just before the doorway they had come
out of, Vanin made another effort to stand, and fell back. Mat bit
back a curse. Lugging Vanin was going to slow him, but if his luck
was in&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;it had not saved Elayne, but maybe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;From the
corner of his eye, he saw her move, lifting a hand to her head.</p>

<p>The man in the gray coat saw it, too. With a smile,
he turned toward her.</p>

<p>Sighing, Mat tucked the useless knife into its
scabbard. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have her,&rdquo; he said loudly. Promises. One
jerk broke the leather cord around his neck; the silver foxhead
dangled a foot below his fist. It made a low hum as he whirled it
in a double loop. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t bloody have her.&rdquo; He started
forward, keeping the medallion spinning. The first step was the
hardest, but he had a promise to keep.</p>

<p>The fellow&rsquo;s smile faded. Watching the flashing
foxhead warily, he backed away on his toes. The same light that
glittered on the whirling silver, from the single window, made a
halo around him. If Mat could drive him that far, maybe he could
see whether a six-story drop would do what a knife could not.</p>

<p>Brand livid on his face, the fellow backed away,
sometimes half-reaching as if to try grabbing past the medallion.
And suddenly, he darted to one side, into one of the rooms. This
one had a door that he pulled shut behind him. Mat heard the bar
drop.</p>

<p>Maybe he should have left it there, but without
thinking, he raised a foot and slammed the heel of his boot against
the center of the door. Dust leaped off the rough wood. A second
kick, and rotten bar-catches gave way, along with a rusted hinge.
The door fell in, hanging at a slanted angle.</p>

<p>The room was not entirely dark. A little light
reached it from the window at the end of the hall, just one door
away, and a broken triangle of mirror leaning against the far wall
spread a faint illumination. That mirror let him see everything
without going in. Aside from that and a piece of a chair, there was
nothing else to see. The only openings were the doorway and a
rathole beside the mirror, but the man in the gray coat was
gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat,&rdquo; Elayne called faintly. He hurried away from
the room as much as toward her. There was shouting somewhere below,
but Nynaeve and the rest would have to take care of themselves for
the moment.</p>

<p>Elayne was sitting up, working her jaw and wincing,
when he knelt beside her. Dust covered her dress, her hat hung
askew, some of the plumes broken, and her red-gold hair looked as
if she had been dragged by it. &ldquo;He hit me so hard,&rdquo; she said
painfully. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anything is broken, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Her
eyes latched on to his, and if he had ever thought she looked at
him as if he were a stranger, he saw it for true now. &ldquo;I saw what
you did, Mat. With him. We might as well have been chickens in a
box with a weasel. Channeling wouldn&rsquo;t touch him; the flows
melted the way they do with your&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Glancing at the medallion
still hanging from his fist, she drew a breath that did interesting
things to that oval cut-out. &ldquo;Thank you, Mat. I apologize for
everything I ever did or thought.&rdquo; She sounded as though she really
meant it. &ldquo;I keep building up <em>toh</em> toward you,&rdquo; she smiled
ruefully, &ldquo;but I am <em>not</em> going to let you beat me. You are
going to have to let me save you at least once to balance
matters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what I can arrange,&rdquo; he said dryly,
stuffing the medallion into a coat pocket. <em>Toh</em>? Beat her?
Light! The woman was definitely spending too much time with
Aviendha.</p>

<p>Once he helped her to her feet, she looked at the
hallway, at Vanin with his blood-smeared face, and the women lying
where they had fallen, and she grimaced. &ldquo;Oh, Light!&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;Oh, blood and bloody flaming ashes!&rdquo; Despite the situation, he
gave a start. It was not just that he had never expected to hear
those words out of her mouth; they seemed peculiar, as if she knew
the sounds but not the meanings. Somehow, they made her sound
younger than she looked.</p>

<p>Shaking off his arm, she discarded her hat, just
tossing it aside, and hurried to kneel beside the nearest Wise
Woman, Reanne, and take her head in both hands. The woman lay
limp, face down and arms stretched out as though she had been
tripped up running. Toward the room everyone had been after, toward
her attacker, not away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is beyond me,&rdquo; Elayne muttered. &ldquo;Where is
Nynaeve? Why didn&rsquo;t she come up with you, Mat? Nynaeve!&rdquo; she
shouted toward the stairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No need to shriek like a cat,&rdquo; Nynaeve growled,
appearing in the stairwell. She was looking back over her shoulder
down the stairs, though. &ldquo;You hold her tight, you hear me?&rdquo; she
shrieked like a cat. She carried her hat, and shook it at whoever
she was shouting at. &ldquo;You let her get away, too, and I&rsquo;ll box
your ears till you hear bells next year!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned, then, and her eyes nearly bulged out of
her head. &ldquo;The Light shine on us,&rdquo; she breathed, hurrying to bend
over Janira. One touch, and she straightened, wincing painfully. He
could have told her the woman was dead. Nynaeve seemed to take
death personally. Giving herself a shake, she went on to the next,
Tamarla, and this time it appeared there was something she could
Heal. It also appeared Tamarla&rsquo;s injuries were not simple,
because she knelt over her, frowning. &ldquo;What happened here, Mat?&rdquo;
she demanded without looking around at him. Her tone made him sigh;
he might have known she would decide it was his fault. &ldquo;Well, Mat?
What happened? Will you speak up, man, or do I have to&mdash;&rdquo; He
never learned what threat she intended to offer.</p>

<p>Lan had followed Nynaeve out of the stairwell, of
course, with Sumeko right at his heels. The stout Wise Woman took
one look at the hall and immediately lifted her skirts and ran to
Reanne. She did give Elayne one worried glance before lowering
herself to her knees and beginning to move her hands over Reanne in
an odd way. That was what pulled Nynaeve up short.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; she said sharply. Not halting
what she was doing to Tamarla, she spared the round-faced woman
only short glances, but they were as piercing as her voice. &ldquo;Where
did you learn that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sumeko gave a start, but her hands did not stop. &ldquo;Forgive me, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; she said in a breathless, disjointed rush. &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m not supposed to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She&rsquo;ll die if I
don&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I know I wasn&rsquo;t supposed to keep trying to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I just wanted to learn, Aes Sedai. Please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, go on,&rdquo; Nynaeve said absently. Most of her
attention was fixed on the woman under her hands, but not all. &ldquo;You
seem to know a few things even I&mdash;That is to say, you have a
very interesting way with the flows. I suspect you&rsquo;ll find
that a great many sisters want to learn from you.&rdquo; Half under her
breath, she added, &ldquo;Maybe now they&rsquo;ll leave me alone.&rdquo; Sumeko
could not have heard that last, but what she did hear dropped her
chin to her considerable chest. Her hands barely paused,
though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elayne,&rdquo; Nynaeve went on, &ldquo;would you look for the
Bowl, please? I suspect that door is the one.&rdquo; She nodded to the
correct door, standing open like half a dozen others. That made Mat
blink until he saw two tiny cloth-wrapped bundles lying in front of
it where the looters must have dropped them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Elayne muttered. &ldquo;Yes, I can do that much, at
least.&rdquo; Half-raising a hand toward Vanin, still on his knees, she
let it fall with a sigh and strode through the doorway, which
almost immediately emitted a cloud of dust and the sound of
coughing.</p>

<p>The more-than-plump Wise Woman had not been the only
one following Nynaeve and Lan. Ieine stalked out of the stairwell,
forcing the Taraboner Darkfriend in front of her by means of an arm
twisted up into her back and a fist clutching the back of her neck.
Ieine&rsquo;s jaw was set, her mouth tight; her face was half
frightened certainty that she would be skinned alive for
manhandling an Aes Sedai, and half determination to hold on no
matter what. Nynaeve had that effect on people, sometimes. The
Black sister was wide-eyed with terror, sagging so she surely would
have fallen except for Ieine&rsquo;s grip. She must have been
shielded, certainly, and with equal surety she probably would have
chosen being skinned to whatever was going to happen to her. Tears
began leaking from her eyes, and her mouth sagged in silent
sobs.</p>

<p>Behind them came Beslan, who gave a sad sigh at the
sight of Nalesean and a sadder for the women, and then Harnan and
three of the Redarms, Fergin and Gorderan and Metwyn. Three who had
been at the front of the building. Harnan and two of the others had
bloody gashes in their coats, but Nynaeve must have Healed them
below. They did not move as if they still had injuries. They looked
very subdued, though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happened at the back?&rdquo; Mat asked quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn me if I know,&rdquo; Harnan replied. &ldquo;We walked right
into a knot of shoulder thumpers with knives in the dark. There was
one, moved like a snake&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He shrugged, touching the
bloodstained hole in his coat absentmindedly. &ldquo;One of them got a
knife into me, and the next I remember is opening my eyes with
Nynaeve Sedai bending over me and Mendair and the others dead as
yesterday&rsquo;s mutton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat nodded. One who moved like a snake. And got out
of rooms like one, too. He looked around the hallway. Reanne and
Tamarla were on their feet&mdash;straightening their dresses, of
course&mdash;and Vanin, peering into the room where Elayne was
apparently trying out some more curses, seemingly with no more
success than earlier. It was hard to tell because of the coughing.
Nynaeve stood, helping up Sibella, a scrawny yellow-haired woman,
and Sumeko was still working on Famelle, with her pale-honey hair
and big brown eyes. But he was never going to admire Melore&rsquo;s
bosom again; Reanne knelt to straighten her limbs and close her
eyes, while Tamarla performed the same service for Janira. Two Wise
Women dead, and six of his Redarms. Killed by a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;man&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the
Power would not touch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found it!&rdquo; Elayne shouted excitedly. She
strode back out into the hall holding a wide round bundle of rotted
cloth she would not let Vanin take from her. Coated in gray from
head to toe, she looked as if she had lain down and rolled in the
dust. &ldquo;We have the Bowl of the Winds, Nynaeve!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; Mat announced, &ldquo;we are bloody well
getting out of here now.&rdquo; Nobody argued. Oh, Nynaeve and Elayne
insisted on all the men making sacks out of their jackets for
things they rooted out of the room&mdash;they even loaded the Wise
Women down, and themselves&mdash;and Reanne had to go down and
recruit men to carry their dead down the boat landing, but nobody
argued. He doubted if the Rahad had ever seen as odd a procession
as made its way to the river, or one that moved more quickly.</p>
