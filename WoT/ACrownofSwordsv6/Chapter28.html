knew he was in trouble from the day he moved into
the Tarasin Palace. He could have refused. Just because the flaming
dice started or stopped did not mean he had to <em>do</em>
anything; usually when they stopped spinning, it was too late not
to do something. The problem was, he wanted to know why. Before
very many days, he wished he had taken his curiosity by the throat
and throttled it.</p>

<p>After Nynaeve and Elayne left his room, once he could
manage to reach his feet without his head falling off, he spread
the word among his men. Nobody seemed to see the disadvantages. He
just wanted to prepare them, but nobody listened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good, my Lord,&rdquo; Nerim murmured, tugging
Mat&rsquo;s boot onto his foot. &ldquo;My Lord will finally have decent
rooms. Oh, very good.&rdquo; For a moment, he seemed to lose his mournful
expression. For just a moment. &ldquo;I will brush the red silk coat for
my Lord; my Lord has stained the blue rather badly with wine.&rdquo; Mat
waited impatiently, put on the coat, and headed down the hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aes Sedai?&rdquo; Nalesean muttered as his head popped out
at the top of a clean shirt. His round-bellied manservant, Lopin,
was hovering behind him. &ldquo;Burn my soul, I don&rsquo;t much like Aes
Sedai, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The Tarasin Palace, Mat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat winced; bad enough the man could drink a barrel
of brandy with no effect the next morning, but did he have to grin
so? &ldquo;Ah, Mat, now we can forget dice, and play cards with our own
kind.&rdquo; He meant nobles, the only ones who could afford to play
except for well-to-do merchants who would not remain well-to-do
long if they began betting for the stakes nobles did. Nalesean
rubbed his hands briskly while Lopin tried to settle his laces;
even his beard seemed eager. &ldquo;Silk sheets,&rdquo; he murmured. Whoever
heard of silk <em>sheets</em>? Those old memories nudged, but Mat
refused to listen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Full of nobles,&rdquo; Vanin growled downstairs, pursing
his lips to spit. His glance searching for Mistress Anan was
automatic now; he decided instead to swallow from the mug of rough
wine that was his breakfast. &ldquo;Be good to see the Lady Elayne again,
though,&rdquo; he mused. His free hand rose as if to knuckle his
forehead; he did not seem aware of the gesture. Mat groaned. That
woman had ruined a good man. &ldquo;You want me to look in on Carridin
again?&rdquo; Vanin went on as if the rest was unimportant. &ldquo;His
street&rsquo;s so full of beggars, it&rsquo;s hard to see anything,
but he has an awful lot of folk come to call.&rdquo; Mat told him that
would be fine. No wonder Vanin did not care whether the palace was
full of nobles and Aes Sedai; he would spend the day sweating in
the sun and jostled by the crowds. Much more comfortable.</p>

<p>There was no point trying to warn Harnan and the rest
of the Redarms, all shoveling down white porridge and tiny black
sausages while they nudged one another in the ribs and laughed
about the serving women in the palace, who, they had heard, were
all chosen for their beauty and remarkably free with their favors.
A true fact, they kept assuring themselves.</p>

<p>Things did not get any better when he went into the
kitchens searching for Mistress Anan to settle the bill. Caira was
there, but with all her bad temper of the night before doubled; she
stuck out her lower lip, glowering at him, and stalked out the door
to the stableyard rubbing the back of her skirt. Maybe she had
gotten herself into some misery or other, but how she could blame
Mat Cauthon was beyond him.</p>

<p>Mistress Anan was out, it seemed&mdash;she was
always organizing soup kitchens for refugees or leaping into some
other good work&mdash;but Enid was waving a long wooden spoon at
her scurrying helpers and ready to take his coin in her stout hand. &ldquo;You squeeze too many melons, my young Lord, and you shouldn&rsquo;t
be surprised when a rotten one breaks in your hand,&rdquo; she said
darkly for some reason. &ldquo;Or two,&rdquo; she added after a moment,
nodding. She leaned close, tilting up her sweating round face with
an intent stare. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll only make trouble for yourself if you
say a word. You won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; That did not sound like a
question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a word,&rdquo; Mat said. What in the Light was she
talking about? It seemed the right response, though, because she
nodded and waddled away waving that spoon twice as vigorously as
before. For a moment, he had thought she meant to thump him with
it. The pure truth was, women all had a violent streak, not just
some of them.</p>

<p>One thing and another, it was a relief when Nerim and
Lopin got into a shouting match over whose master&rsquo;s baggage
would be carried over first. Smoothing their feathers required a
good half an hour from him and Nalesean both. A manservant with his
dander ruffled could make your life miserable. Then he had to
settle which of the Redarms were to have the honor of lugging the
chest of gold across and which were to take the horses. Anyway, it
was that much longer outside the bloody Tarasin Palace.</p>

<p>Once he was ensconced in his new rooms, though, he
almost forgot troubles at first. He had a large sitting room and a
small, what they called a sulking room hereabouts, and an immense
bedchamber with the biggest bed he had ever seen, the massive
bedposts carved with entwined flowers of all things, and painted
red. Most of the furniture was bright red or bright blue, where it
was not layered with gilt. A small door near the bed led to a
cramped room for Nerim, which the fellow seemed to think was
excellent despite a narrow bed and no window. Mat&rsquo;s rooms all
had tall arched windows letting onto white wrought-iron balconies
that overlooked the Mol Hara. The stand-lamps were gilded, and so
were the mirror frames; there were two mirrors in the sulking room,
three in the sitting room, and <em>four</em> in the bedchamber. The
clock&mdash;a clock!&mdash;on the marble mantel above the
fireplace in the sitting room sparkled with gilt, as well. The
washbasin and pitcher were red Sea Folk porcelain. He was almost
disappointed to discover that the chamber pot under the bed was
only plain white pottery. There was even a shelf in the large
sitting room with a full dozen books. Not that he read much.</p>

<p>Even given the jarring colors of walls and ceilings
and floor tiles, the rooms shouted rich. Any other time, he would
have danced a jig. Any time when he was not aware that a woman with
chambers right down the hall wanted to stick him in hot water and
put a bellows to the fire. If Teslyn or Merilille or one of that
lot did not manage it first despite his medallion. Why <em>had</em>
the dice in his head stopped tumbling as soon as Elayne mentioned
these bloody rooms? Curiosity. He had heard a saying on several
women&rsquo;s lips back home, usually when he had done something
that looked fun at the time. &ldquo;Men teach cats curiosity, but cats
keep sense for themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no bloody cat,&rdquo; he muttered, stalking out
of the bedchamber into the sitting room. He just had to know; that
was all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;re not a cat,&rdquo; Tylin said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a succulent little duckling, is what you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat gave a start and stared. Duckling? And a <em>little</em> duckling, at that! The woman stood well short of his
shoulder. Indignation or no indignation, he managed an elegant bow
anyway. She was the Queen; he had to remember that. &ldquo;Majesty, thank
you for these wonderful apartments. I&rsquo;d love to talk with you,
but I have to go out and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Smiling, she advanced across the red-and-green floor
tiles, layered blue and white silk petticoats swishing, large dark
eyes fixed on him. He had no desire at all to look at the marriage
knife nestled in her generous cleavage. Or the larger, gem-studded
dagger thrust behind an equally gem-studded belt. He backed
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Majesty, I have an important&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She started humming. He recognized the tune; he had
hummed it to a few girls lately. He was wise enough not to try
actually singing with his voice, and besides, the words they used
in Ebou Dar would have singed his ears. Around here, they called it &ldquo;I Will Steal Your Breath with Kisses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laughing nervously, he tried to put a lapis-inlaid
table between them, but she somehow got around it first without
seeming to increase her speed. &ldquo;Majesty, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laid a hand flat on his chest, back-heeled him
into a high-backed chair, and plumped herself down on his lap.
Between her and the chair arms, he was trapped. Oh, he could have
picked her up and set her on her feet quite easily. Except that she
did have that bloody big dagger in her belt, and he doubted his
manhandling her would be as acceptable to her as her manhandling
him seemed to be. This was Ebou Dar, after all, where a woman
killing a man was justified until proven otherwise. He could have
picked her up easily, except&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He had seen fishmongers in the city selling peculiar
creatures called squid and octopus&mdash;Ebou Dari actually
<em>ate</em> the things!&mdash;but they had nothing on Tylin. The
woman possessed ten hands. He thrashed about, vainly trying to fend
her off, and she laughed softly. Between kisses, he breathlessly
protested that someone might walk in, and she just chuckled. He
babbled his respect for her crown, and she chortled. He claimed
betrothal to a girl back home who held his heart in her hands. She
really laughed at that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What she does not know cannot harm her,&rdquo; she
murmured, her twenty hands not slowing for an instant.</p>

<p>Someone knocked at the door.</p>

<p>Prying his mouth free, he shouted, &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; Well,
it was a shout. A high-pitched shout. He was out of breath, after
all.</p>

<p>Tylin was off his lap and three paces away so fast it
seemed she was just here then there. The woman had the nerve to
give him a reproachful look! And then she made a kiss at him.</p>

<p>That barely left her lips before the door opened, and
Thom stuck his head in. &ldquo;Mat? I wasn&rsquo;t sure that was you. Oh!
Majesty.&rdquo; For a scrawny old gleeman with pretensions, Thom could
flourish a bow with the best in spite of his limp. Juilin could
not, but he snatched off his ridiculous red hat and did what he
could. &ldquo;Forgive us. We won&rsquo;t disturb&mdash;&rdquo; Thom began, but
Mat broke in hurriedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in, Thom!&rdquo; Snatching his coat back all the way
on, he started to stand, then realized that somehow the bloody
woman had untied the waist of his <em>breeches</em> without him
noticing. These two might miss that his shirt was undone to his
belly, but they would not miss his breeches falling off.
Tylin&rsquo;s blue dress was not mussed at all! &ldquo;Juilin, come
in!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad you find the rooms acceptable, Master
Cauthon,&rdquo; Tylin said, dignity incarnate. Except for her eyes,
anyway, when she stood so Thom and Juilin could not see them. Her
eyes laced innocuous words with added meaning. &ldquo;I look forward to
having your company with pleasure; I shall find it interesting,
having a <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> where I can reach out and touch him
at will. But I must leave you to your friends, now. No, do not
stand; please.&rdquo; That with just the hint of a mocking smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, boy,&rdquo; Thom said, knuckling his mustaches when
she was gone, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s luck for you, being welcomed with open
arms by the Queen herself.&rdquo; Juilin became very interested in his
cap.</p>

<p>Mat eyed them warily, mentally daring them to say a
word more&mdash;just one word!&mdash;but once he asked after
Nynaeve and Elayne, he quit worrying what they suspected. The women
were not back. He almost leaped up, breeches or no. They were
trying to wiggle out of their agreement already; he had to explain
what he meant in between their outbursts of incredulity, in between
expressing his opinions of Nynaeve bloody al&rsquo;Meara and Elayne
bloody Daughter-Heir. Not much chance they would have gone off to
the Rahad without him, but he would not put it past them to try
their hand spying on Carridin. Elayne would demand a confession and
expect the man to break down; Nynaeve would try to beat one out of
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt they are bothering Carridin,&rdquo; Juilin said,
scratching behind his ear. &ldquo;I believe Aviendha and Birgitte are
taking a look at him, from what I heard. We didn&rsquo;t see them
go. I do not think you need to worry about him knowing what
he&rsquo;s seeing even if he walks right by them.&rdquo; Thom, pouring
himself a golden goblet of the wine punch that Mat had found
waiting, took up the explanation.</p>

<p>Mat put a hand over his eyes. Disguises made with the
Power; no wonder they had slipped away like snakes whenever they
wanted. Those women were going to make trouble. That was what women
did best. It hardly surprised him to learn that Thom and Juilin
knew less about this Bowl of the Winds than he did.</p>

<p>After they left to ready themselves for a trip to the
Rahad, he had time to set his clothes to rights before Nynaeve and
Elayne came back. He had time to check on Olver, in his room one
floor down. The boy&rsquo;s skinny frame had fleshed out somewhat,
with Enid and the rest of the cooks at The Wandering Woman stuffing
him, but he would always be short even for a Cairhienin, and if his
ears shrank to half their size and his mouth to half its width, his
nose would still stop him well short of handsome. No fewer than
three serving women fussed over him while he sat cross-legged on
his bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat, doesn&rsquo;t Haesel have the most beautiful
eyes?&rdquo; Olver said, beaming at the big-eyed young woman Mat had met
the last time he came to the palace. She beamed back and ruffled
the boy&rsquo;s hair. &ldquo;Oh, but Alis and Loya are so sweet, I could
never choose.&rdquo; A plump woman just short of her middle years looked
up from unpacking Olver&rsquo;s saddlebags to give him a broad grin,
and a slender girl with bee-stung lips patted the towel she had
just put on his washstand, then flung herself onto the bed to
tickle Olver&rsquo;s ribs till he fell over laughing helplessly.</p>

<p>Mat snorted. Harnan and that lot were bad enough, but
now these <em>women</em> were encouraging the boy! How was he ever
going to learn to behave if women did that? Olver ought to be
playing in the streets like any other ten-year-old. <em>He</em> had
had no serving women falling over him in his rooms. Tylin had seen
to that, he was sure.</p>

<p>He had time to check on Olver, and to look in on
Harnan and the rest of the Redarms, sharing a long room lined with
beds not far from the stables, and to saunter down to the kitchens
for some bread and beef&mdash;he had not been able to face that
porridge back at the inn. Still Nynaeve and Elayne had not
returned. He finally looked over the books in his sitting room and
began reading <em>The Travels of Jain Farstrider</em>, though he
barely made out a word for worrying. Thom and Juilin came in just
as the women finally bustled in exclaiming over finding him there,
as if they thought <em>he</em> would not keep his word.</p>

<p>He closed the book gently, set it gently on the table
beside his chair. &ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, we went for a walk,&rdquo; Elayne said brightly, blue
eyes wider than he remembered seeing before. Thom frowned and
produced a knife from his sleeve, rolling it back and forth through
his fingers. He very markedly did not so much as glance at
Elayne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had tea with some women your innkeeper knows,&rdquo;
Nynaeve said. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t bore you with talk about needlework.&rdquo;
Juilin started to shake his head, then stopped before she
noticed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, don&rsquo;t bore me,&rdquo; Mat said dryly. He
supposed she knew one end of a needle from the other, but he
suspected she would as soon stick one through her tongue as talk
about needlework. Neither woman cracked her teeth about civility,
confirming his worst suspicions. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told off two fellows to
walk out with each of you this afternoon, and there will be two
more tomorrow and every day. If you&rsquo;re not inside the palace
or under my nose, you&rsquo;ll have bodyguards. They know their
turns already. They&rsquo;ll stay with you at all times&mdash;<em>all</em> times&mdash;and you will let me know where you&rsquo;re
headed. No more making me worry till my hair falls out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He expected indignation and argument. He expected
weaseling over what they had or had not promised. He expected that
demanding this whole loaf might get him a slice at the end; a butt
slice, if his luck was in. Nynaeve looked at Elayne; Elayne looked
at Nynaeve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, bodyguards are a <em>wonderful</em> idea, Mat,&rdquo;
Elayne exclaimed, her cheek dimpling in a smile. &ldquo;I suppose you
were right about that. It&rsquo;s very smart of you to have your men
already to a schedule.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It <em>is</em> a wonderful notion,&rdquo; Nynaeve said,
nodding enthusiastically, &ldquo;Very smart of you, Mat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom dropped the knife with a muffled curse and sat
sucking on a nicked finger, staring at the women.</p>

<p>Mat sighed. Trouble; he had known it. And that was
before they told him to forget the Rahad for the time being.</p>

<p>Which was how he found himself on a bench in front of
a cheap tavern not far from the riverfront called The Rose of the
Elbar, drinking from one of the dented tin cups chained to the
bench. At least they washed the cups out for each new patron. The
stink from a dyer&rsquo;s shop across the way only raised the style
of the Rose. Not that it was a shabby neighborhood really, though
the street was too narrow for carriages. A fair number of brightly
lacquered sedan chairs swayed through the crowd. If far more
passersby wore wool and perhaps a guild vest than silk, the wool
was as often well cut as frayed. The houses and shops were the
usual array of white plaster, and if most were small and even
run-down, the tall house of a wealthy merchant stood on a corner to
his right and on the left a diminutive palace&mdash;smaller than
the merchant&rsquo;s house, at least&mdash;with a single
green-banded dome and no spire. A pair of taverns and an inn in
plain sight looked cool and inviting. Unfortunately, the Rose was
the only one where a man could sit outside, the only one in just
the right spot. Unfortunately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt I&rsquo;ve ever seen such splendid flies,&rdquo;
Nalesean grumbled, waving away several choice specimens from his
cup. &ldquo;What is it we&rsquo;re doing again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are swilling that foul excuse for wine and
sweating like a goat,&rdquo; Mat muttered, tugging his hat to shade his
eyes better. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m being <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>.&rdquo; He glared at
the dilapidated house, between the dyer&rsquo;s and a noisy
weaver&rsquo;s establishment, that he had been told to watch. Not
asked&mdash;told&mdash;that was what it came to, however they
phrased it, squirming around their pledges. Oh, they made it sound
like asking, made it sound like pleading at the end, which he would
believe when dogs danced, but he knew when he had been bullied. &ldquo;Just be <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, Mat,&rdquo; he mimicked. &ldquo;I know
you&rsquo;ll just <em>know</em> what to do. Bah!&rdquo; Maybe Elayne
bloody Daughter-Heir and her bloody dimple knew, or Nynaeve with
her bloody hands twitching to yank her bloody braid, but he would
be burned if he did. &ldquo;If the pig-kissing Bowl is in the Rahad, how
am I supposed to find it on this flaming side of the river?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not remember them saying,&rdquo; Juilin said wryly,
and took a long swallow of some drink made from a yellow fruit
grown in the countryside. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve asked that fifty times, at
least.&rdquo; He claimed the pale drink was refreshing in the heat, but
Mat had taken a bite of one of those lemons, and he was not about
to swallow anything made from them. With his head still throbbing
faintly, he himself drank tea. It tasted as if the tavern-keeper, a
scrawny fellow with beady suspicious eyes, had been dumping new
leaves and water in yesterday&rsquo;s leavings since the founding of
the city. The taste suited his mood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What interests me,&rdquo; Thom murmured over steepled
fingers, &ldquo;is why they asked so many questions about your
innkeeper.&rdquo; He did not seem very upset at the women still keeping
secrets; sometimes, he was decidedly odd. &ldquo;What do Setalle Anan and
these women have to do with the Bowl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Women did pass in and out of the dilapidated house. A
steady stream of women, just about, some well dressed if none in
silks, and not one man. Three or four wore the red belt of a Wise
Woman. Mat had considered following some of them when they left,
but it felt too planned. He did not know how <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>
worked&mdash;he had never really seen any sign of it in himself&mdash;but his luck was always best when everything was random.
Like with dice. Most of those little iron tavern puzzles eluded
him, however lucky he felt.</p>

<p>He ignored Thom&rsquo;s question; Thom had asked it at
least as often as Mat had asked how he was to find the Bowl here.
Nynaeve had told him to his face she had not promised to tell him
every last thing she knew; she said she would tell him whatever he
needed to know; she said&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Watching her nearly choke from not
calling him names was not nearly enough vengeance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I should take a walk down the alley,&rdquo;
Nalesean sighed. &ldquo;In case one of those women decides to climb over
the garden wall.&rdquo; The narrow gap between the house and the dyer lay
in full view for its whole length, but another alleyway ran along
behind the shops and houses. &ldquo;Mat, tell me again why we&rsquo;re
doing this instead of playing cards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; Mat said. Maybe he would find out
how <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> worked behind the garden wall. He went,
and found out nothing.</p>

<p>By the time twilight began creeping over the street
and Harnan came with a bald-headed, narrow-eyed Andoran named Wat,
the only possible effect of being <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> he had
seen was that the tavern-keeper brewed a fresh pot of tea. It
tasted almost as bad as the old.</p>

<p>Back in his rooms in the palace, he found a note, an
invitation of sorts, elegantly lettered on thick white paper that
smelled like a garden of flowers.</p>

<p class="note">My little rabbit, I expect to have you for dinner tonight in my
apartments.</p>

<p>No signature, but he hardly needed one. Light! The
woman had no shame at all! There was a red-painted iron lock on the
door to the corridor; he found the key and locked it. Then, for
good measure, he jammed a chair under the latch on the door to
Nerim&rsquo;s room. He could do well enough without dinner. Just as
he was about to climb into bed, the lock rattled; out in the hall,
a woman laughed at finding the door secured.</p>

<p>He should have been able to sleep soundly then, but
for some reason he lay there listening to his belly grumble. Why
was she doing this? Well, he knew why, but why him? Surely she had
not decided to toss all decency over the barn just to bed a <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>. He was safe now, anyway. Tylin would not batter
down the door, after all. Would she? Not even most birds could get
in through the wrought-iron arabesques screening the balconies.
Besides, she would need a long ladder to reach that high. And men
to carry it. Unless she climbed down from the roof on a rope. Or
she could&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The night passed, his stomach rumbled, the sun
rose, and he never closed his eyes or had a decent thought. Except
that he did make a decision. He thought of a use for the sulking
room. He certainly never sulked.</p>

<p>At first light, he sneaked out of his rooms and
found another of the palace servants he remembered, a balding
fellow named Madic, with a smug, self-satisfied air and a shy twist
to his mouth that said he was not satisfied at all. A man who could
be bought. Though the startled look that flashed across his square
face, and the smirk he barely bothered to hide, said he knew
exactly why Mat was slipping gold into his hand. Blood and ashes!
How many people knew what Tylin was up to?</p>

<p>Nynaeve and Elayne did not seem to, thank the Light.
Though that did mean they chided him about missing dinner with the
Queen, which they had learned about when Tylin inquired whether he
was ill. And worse&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; Elayne said, smiling almost as if the word
did not pain her, &ldquo;you must put your best foot forward with the
Queen. Don&rsquo;t be nervous. You&rsquo;ll enjoy an evening with
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t do anything to offend her,&rdquo; Nynaeve
muttered. There was no doubt with her that being civil hurt; her
brows drew down in concentration, her jaw tightened, and her hands
trembled to pull her braid. &ldquo;Be accommodating for once in your&mdash;I mean to say, remember she&rsquo;s a decent woman, and
don&rsquo;t try any of your&mdash;Light, you know what I mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nervous. Ha! Decent woman. Ha!</p>

<p>Neither seemed the least concerned that he had wasted
a whole afternoon. Elayne patted his shoulder sympathetically and
asked him please to try another day or two; it certainly was better
than tramping through the Rahad in this heat. Nynaeve said the
exact same thing, the way women did, but without the shoulder pat.
They admitted right out that they intended to spend the day trying
to spy on Carridin with Aviendha, though they evaded his question
of who it was they thought they might recognize. Nynaeve let that
slip, and Elayne gave her such a look he thought he might see
Nynaeve&rsquo;s ears boxed for once.</p>

<p>They meekly accepted his stricture not to lose sight
of their bodyguards, and meekly let him see the disguises they
intended to wear. Even after Thom&rsquo;s description, seeing the
pair suddenly turn into Ebou Dari women in front of his eyes was
almost as big a shock as their meekness. Well, Nynaeve made a
sickly stab at meekness, growling when she realized he had meant
what he said about the Aiel woman needing no bodyguard, but she
came close. Either one of these women folding her hands and
answering submissively made him nervous. Both of them together&mdash;with Aviendha nodding <em>approvingly</em>!&mdash;and he
was happy to send them on their way. Just to be sure, though, he
ignored their suddenly flat mouths and made them demonstrate their
disguises for the men he was sending along first. Vanin leaped at
the chance to be one of Elayne&rsquo;s guards, knuckling his
forehead right and left like a fool.</p>

<p>The fat man had not learned much watching on his own.
Just as on the day before, a surprising number of people had come
to call on Carridin, including some in silk, but that was not proof
they were all Darkfriends. All said and done, the man was the
Whitecloak ambassador; more folk who wanted to trade into Amadicia
probably went to him than to the Amadician ambassador, whoever he
or she was. Vanin did say two women had definitely been watching
Carridin&rsquo;s palace, too&mdash;the look on his face when
Aviendha suddenly turned into a third Ebou Dari woman was a wonder&mdash;and also an old man, he thought, though the fellow proved
surprisingly spry. Vanin had not managed to get a good look at him
despite spotting him three times. Once Vanin and the women left,
Mat sent off Thom and Juilin to see what they could uncover
concerning Jaichim Carridin and a bent, white-haired old man with
an interest in Darkfriends. If the thief-catcher could not discover
a way to trip Carridin on his face, it did not exist, and Thom
seemed to have a way of putting together all the gossip and rumor
in a place and filtering out the truth. All that was the easy part,
of course.</p>

<p>For two days he sweated on that bench, with an
occasional stroll down the alley beside the dyer&rsquo;s, and the
only thing that changed was that the tea got worse again. The wine
was so bad, Nalesean began drinking ale. The first day, the
tavern-keeper offered fish for a midday meal, but by the smell they
had been caught last week. The second day, he offered a stew of
oysters; Mat ate five bowls of that despite the bits of shell.
Birgitte declined both.</p>

<p>He had been surprised when she caught up to him and
Nalesean hurrying across the Mol Hara that first morning. The sun
barely made a rim above the rooftops, but already people and carts
dotted the square. &ldquo;I must have blinked,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;I was
waiting the way I thought you&rsquo;d come out. If you don&rsquo;t
mind company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We move fast sometimes,&rdquo; he said evasively. Nalesean
looked at him sideways; of course, he had no idea why they had
crept out through a tiny side door near the stables. It was not
that Mat thought Tylin would actually leap on him in the halls in
broad daylight, but then again, it never hurt to be careful. &ldquo;Your
company is welcome any time. Uh. Thanks.&rdquo; She just shrugged and
murmured something he did not catch and fell in on the other side
of him.</p>

<p>That was the beginning with her. Any other woman he
had ever known would have demanded to know thanks for what, and
then explained why none were necessary at such length that he
wanted to cover his ears, or upbraided him at equal length for
thinking they were, or sometimes made it clear she expected
something more substantial than words. Birgitte just shrugged, and
over the next two days, something startling occurred in his
head.</p>

<p>Normally, to him, women were to admire and smile at,
to dance with and kiss if they would allow, to snuggle with if he
was lucky. Deciding which women to chase was almost as much fun as
chasing them, if not nearly so much as catching them. Some women
were just friends, of course. A few. Egwene, for one, though he was
not sure how that friendship would survive her becoming Amyrlin.
Nynaeve was sort of a friend, in a way; if she could forget for one
hour that she had switched his bottom more than once and remember
he was not a boy anymore. But a woman friend was different from a
man; you always knew her mind ran along other paths than yours,
that she saw the world with different eyes.</p>

<p>Birgitte leaned toward him on the bench. &ldquo;Best be
wary,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;That widow is looking for a new husband; the
sheath on her marriage knife is blue. Besides, the house is over
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He blinked, losing sight of the sweetly plump woman
who rolled her hips so extravagantly as she walked, and Birgitte
answered his sheepish grin with a laugh. Nynaeve would have flayed
him with her tongue for looking, and even Egwene would have been
coolly disapproving. By the end of the second day on that bench, he
realized he had sat all that time with his hip pressed against
Birgitte&rsquo;s and never once thought of trying to kiss her. He
was sure she did not want to be kissed by him&mdash;frankly,
considering the dog-ugly men she seemed to enjoy looking at, he
might have been insulted if she had&mdash;and she was a hero out
of legend whom he still half-expected to leap over a house and grab
a couple of the Forsaken by the neck on the way. But that was not
it: He would as soon have thought of kissing Nalesean. The same as
the Tairen, just exactly the same as, he <em>liked</em>
Birgitte.</p>

<p>Two days on that bench, up and down to trot down the
alley beside the dyer and stare at the tall wall of bare brick at
the back of the house&rsquo;s garden. Birgitte could have climbed
it, but even she might have broken her neck if she tried wearing a
dress. Three times he decided on the spur of the moment to follow a
woman coming out of the house, two wearing the red belt of a Wise
Woman. Random chance did seem to invoke his luck. One of the Wise
Women went around the corner and bought a bunch of shriveled
turnips before going back; the other walked two streets over to buy
a pair of big, green-striped fish. The third woman, tall and dark
in neat gray wool, maybe a Tairen, crossed two bridges before
entering a large shop where she was greeted with smiles by a skinny
bowing fellow and began supervising the loading of lacquered boxes
and trays into sawdust-filled baskets that were then loaded into a
wagon. By what he heard, she hoped to fetch a pretty piece of
silver with them in Andor. Mat barely managed to escape without
buying a box. So much for random luck.</p>

<p>No one else had any either. Nynaeve and Elayne and
Aviendha made their pilgrimages to the streets around
Carridin&rsquo;s small palace without seeing anyone they recognized,
which frustrated them no end. They still refused to say who; it
hardly mattered, since the people were not to be seen. That was
what they said, showing him enough teeth for six women. The
grimaces were supposed to be smiles, he thought. It was a shame
Aviendha seemed to have fallen in with the other two so thoroughly,
but there was a moment when he was pressing them for an answer, and
Elayne snapped at him, staring down her nose, and the Aiel woman
whispered something in her ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, Mat,&rdquo; Elayne said earnestly, her face
going so red her hair seemed to pale. &ldquo;I humbly beg pardon for
speaking so. I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;will beg on my knees, if you wish.&rdquo; No
surprise that her voice faltered at the end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No need for that,&rdquo; he said faintly, trying not to
goggle. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re forgiven; it was nothing.&rdquo; The oddest thing,
though; Elayne looked at Aviendha the whole time she spoke to him
and did not twitch an eyelid when he replied, but she heaved a
great sigh of relief when Aviendha nodded. Women were just
strange.</p>

<p>Thom reported that Carridin gave to beggars
frequently, and aside from that, every scrap of word about him in
Ebou Dar was the kind to be expected, depending on whether the
speaker thought Whitecloaks were murderous monsters or the true
saviors of the world. Juilin learned that Carridin had purchased a
plan of the Tarasin Palace, which might indicate some Whitecloak
intention toward Ebou Dar and might indicate that Pedron Niall
wanted a palace for himself and intended to copy the Tarasin. If he
still lived; rumors had sprung up in the city that he was dead, but
then, half said Aes Sedai had killed him and half said Rand had,
which showed their worth. Neither Juilin or Thom had scuffed up a
pebble concerning a white-haired old man with a much-worn face.</p>

<p>Frustration with Carridin, frustration with watching
the bloody house, and as far as the palace went&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mat found out how things were to go that first night
when he finally got back to his rooms. Olver was there, already fed
and curled up in a chair with <em>The Travels of Jain
Farstrider</em> by the light of the stand-lamps, and not at all
upset over being moved out of his own room. Madic had been as good
as his word; as good as the gold he stuffed in his pouch, anyway.
The sulking room now held Olver&rsquo;s bed. Just let Tylin try
anything with a child watching her! The Queen had not been idle
either, though. He sneaked down to the kitchens like a fox,
slipping from corner to corner, flashing down stairs&mdash;and
found there was no food to be had.</p>

<p>Oh, the smell of cooking permeated the air, roasts
turning on spits in the big fireplaces, pots bubbling atop the
white-tiled stoves, and cooks kept popping open ovens to prod this
or that. There was just no food for Mat Cauthon. Smiling women in
pristine white aprons ignored his own smiles and put themselves in
his way so he could not get near the sources of those wonderful
smells. They smiled and rapped his knuckles when he tried to snatch
a loaf of bread or just a bit of honey-glazed turnip. They smiled
and told him he must not spoil his appetite if he was to eat with
the Queen. They knew. Every last one of them knew! His own blushes
as much as anything else drove him back to his rooms, bitterly
regretting that odorous fish at midday. He locked the door behind
him. A woman who would starve a man might try anything.</p>

<p>He was lying on a green silk carpet playing Snakes
and Foxes with Olver when the second note was slipped under his
door.</p>

<p class="note">I have been told it is more sporting to take a pigeon on the
wing, to watch it flutter, but sooner or later, a hungry bird will
fly to the hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Mat?&rdquo; Olver asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; Mat crumpled the note. &ldquo;Another game?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo; The boy would play the fool game all day,
given a chance. &ldquo;Mat, did you try any of that ham they cooked
tonight? I never tasted anything&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just throw the dice, Olver. Just throw the bloody
dice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Coming back for his third night in the palace, he
bought bread and olives and ewe&rsquo;s milk cheese on the way,
which was just as well. The kitchen still had its orders. The
bloody women actually laughed out loud while they wafted steaming
platters of meats and fishes just beyond his reach and told him not
to spoil his bloody appetite.</p>

<p>He maintained his dignity. He did not grab a platter
and run. He made his finest leg, flourishing an imaginary cloak. &ldquo;Gracious ladies, your warmth and hospitality overwhelm me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His withdrawal would have gone a deal better if one
of the cooks had not cackled at his back, &ldquo;The Queen will feast on
roast duckling soon enough, lad.&rdquo; Very droll. The other women
roared so hard, they must have been rolling on the floor. Very
bloody droll.</p>

<p>Bread and olives and salty cheese made a fine meal,
with a little water from his washstand to wash it down. There had
not been any wine punch in his room since that first day. Olver
tried to tell him about some sort of roasted fish with mustard
sauce and raisins; Mat told him to practice his reading.</p>

<p>Nobody slipped a note under his door that night.
Nobody rattled the lock. He began to think things might turn for
the better. Tomorrow was the Festival of Birds. From what he had
heard of the costumes some people wore, men and women both, it
might be possible Tylin would find herself a new duckling to chase
after. Somebody might come out of that bloody house across from the
Rose of the Elbar and hand him the bloody Bowl of the Winds. Things
just had to turn for the better.</p>

<p>When he woke for his third morning in the Tarasin
Palace, the dice were rolling in his head.</p>
