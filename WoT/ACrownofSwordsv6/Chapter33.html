<h4><em>A Bath</em></h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
days after sending Perrin away seemed endless to
Rand, and the nights longer. He retreated to his rooms and stayed
there, telling the Maidens to allow no one to enter. Only Nandera
was allowed past the doors with the gilded suns, bringing his
meals. The sinewy Maiden would set down a covered tray and list
those who had asked to see him, then give him a look of rebuke when
he repeated that he would see no one. Often he heard disapproving
comments from the Maidens outside before she pulled the door shut
behind her; he was intended to hear, else they would have used
handtalk. But if they thought to chivy him out by claiming that he
was sulking&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the Maidens did not understand, and might not if
he explained. If he could have brought himself to.</p>

<p>He picked at the meals without appetite, and tried to
read, but his favorite books could divert him for only a few pages
even in the beginning. At least once every day, though he had
promised himself he would not, he lifted the massive wardrobe of
polished blackwood and ivory in his bedchamber, floated it aside on
flows of Air and carefully unraveled the traps he had set and the
Mask of Mirrors that made the wall seem smooth, all inverted so no
other eyes but his could see. There, in a niche hollowed out with
the Power, stood two small statues of white stone about a foot
tall, a woman and a man, each in flowing robes and holding a clear
crystal sphere overhead in one hand. The night he set the army in
motion toward Illian he had gone to Rhuidean alone to fetch these
<em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>: if he needed them, he might not have much
time. That was what he had told himself. His hand would stretch
toward the bearded man, the only one of the pair a man could use,
stretch out and stop, shaking. One finger touching, and more of the
One Power than he could imagine could be his. With that, no one
could defeat him, no one stand against him. With that, Lanfear had
said once, he could challenge the Creator.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is mine by right,&rdquo; he muttered each time, with
his hand trembling just short of the figure. &ldquo;Mine! I am the Dragon
Reborn!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And each time he made himself draw back, reweaving
the Mask of Mirrors, reweaving the invisible traps that would burn
anyone to a cinder who tried to pass them without the key. The huge
wardrobe wafted back into place like a feather. He was the Dragon
Reborn. But was that enough? It would have to be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the Dragon Reborn,&rdquo; he whispered at the walls
sometimes, and sometimes shouted at them. &ldquo;I am the Dragon Reborn!&rdquo;
Silently and aloud he raged at those who opposed him, the blind
fools who could not see and those who refused to see, for ambition
or avarice or fear. He was the Dragon Reborn, the only hope of the
world against the Dark One. And the Light help the world for
it.</p>

<p>But his rages and thoughts of using the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> were only attempts to escape other things,
and he knew it. Alone, he picked at his meals, though less every
day, and tried to read, though seldom, and attempted to find sleep.
That he tried more often as the days passed, not caring whether the
sun was down or high. Sleep came in fitful snatches, and what
harrowed his waking thoughts also stalked his dreams and chased him
awake too soon for any rest. No amount of shielding could keep out
what was already inside. He had the Forsaken to face, and sooner or
later the Dark One himself. He had fools who fought him or ran away
when their only hope was to stand behind him. Why would his dreams
not let him be? From one dream he always sprang awake before it
more than began, to lie there filled with self-loathing and muddled
with lack of sleep, but the others&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He deserved them all, he
knew.</p>

<p>Colavaere confronted him sleeping, her face black and
the scarf she had used to hang herself still buried in the swollen
flesh of her neck. Colavaere, silent and accusing, with all the
Maidens who had died for him arrayed behind her in silent staring
ranks, all the women who died because of him. He knew every face as
well as his own, and every name but one. From those dreams, he woke
weeping.</p>

<p>A hundred times he hurled Perrin across the Grand
Hall of the Sun, and a hundred times he was overwhelmed by blazing
fear and rage. A hundred times, he killed Perrin in his dreams and
woke to his own screams. Why had the man chosen the Aes Sedai
prisoners to use for their argument? Rand tried not to think about
them; he had done his best to ignore their existence from the
beginning. They were too dangerous to keep long as captives, and he
had no idea what to do with them. They frightened him. Sometimes he
dreamed of being bound inside the box again, of Galina and Erian
and Katerine and the rest taking him out to beat him, dreamed and
woke whimpering even after he convinced himself his eyes were open
and he was outside. They frightened him because he feared he might
give way to the fear and the anger, and then&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He tried not to
think of what he might do then, but sometimes he dreamed it, and
woke shaking in a cold sweat. He would not do that. Whatever he had
done, he would not do that.</p>

<p>In dreams he gathered the Asha&rsquo;man to attack the
White Tower and punish Elaida; he leaped from a gateway filled with
righteous anger and <em>saidin</em>&mdash;and learned that
Alviarin&rsquo;s letter had been a lie, saw her stand alongside
Elaida, saw Egwene beside her, too, and Nynaeve, and even Elayne,
all with Aes Sedai faces, because he was too dangerous to let run
free. He watched the Asha&rsquo;man destroyed by women who had years
of studying the One Power behind them, not just a few months of
harsh tutoring, and from those dreams, he could never wake until
every man in a black coat was dead, and he stood alone to face the
might of the Aes Sedai. Alone.</p>

<p>Again and again Cadsuane spoke those words about
madmen hearing voices, till he flinched at them as at blows of a
whip, flinched in his sleep when she appeared. In dreams and
waking, he called to Lews Therin, shouted at him, screamed for him,
and only silence answered. Alone. That small bundle of sensations
and emotions in the back of his head, the sense of Alanna&rsquo;s
almost touch, slowly became a comfort. In many ways, that
frightened him most of all.</p>

<p>On the fourth morning, he woke groggily from a dream
of the White Tower, flinging up a hand to shield grainy eyes from
what he thought was a flare of <em>saidar</em>-wrought fire. Dust
motes sparkled in the sunlight streaming through the window to
reach his bed, with its great square black-wood bedposts inlaid
with ivory wedges. Every piece of furnishing in the room was
polished blackwood and ivory, square and stark and heavy enough to
suit his mood. For a moment he lay there, but if sleep returned, it
would only bring another dream.</p>

<p><em>Are you there, Lews Therin?</em> he thought
without any hope of answer, and wearily pushed himself to his feet,
tugging his wrinkled coat straight. He had not changed his clothes
since first shutting himself away.</p>

<p>When he staggered into the anteroom, at first he
thought he was dreaming again, the dream that always woke him
straight off in shame and guilt and loathing, but Min looked up at
him from one of the tall gilded chairs, a leather-bound book on her
knees, and he did not wake. Dark ringlets framed her face, big dark
eyes so intent he almost felt her touch. Her breeches of brocaded
green silk fit her like a second skin, and her coat of matching
silk hung open, a cream-colored blouse rising and falling with her
breath. He prayed to wake. It had not been fear, or anger, or guilt
over Colavaere, or Lews Therin&rsquo;s disappearance that drove him
to shut himself away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a feast of sorts in four days,&rdquo; she
said brightly, &ldquo;at the half moon. The Day of Repentance, they call
it for some reason, but there will be dancing that night. Sedate
dancing, I hear, but any dancing is better than none.&rdquo; Carefully
tucking a thin strip of leather into the book, she placed it on the
floor beside her. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just time to have a dress made, if I
set the seamstress to work today. That is, if you mean to dance
with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pulled his gaze away from her, and it fell on a
cloth-covered tray beside the tall doors. Just the thought of food
made him queasy. Nandera was not supposed to let anyone in, burn
her! Least of all Min. He had not mentioned her by name, but he had
said no one! &ldquo;Min, I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what to say. I&mdash;&rdquo; </p>

<p>&ldquo;Sheepherder, you look like what the dogs fought
over. Now I understand why Alanna was so frantic, even if I
don&rsquo;t see how she knew. She practically begged me to speak to
you, after the Maidens turned her away for about the fifth time.
Nandera wouldn&rsquo;t have let <em>me</em> in if she wasn&rsquo;t in
a lather about you not eating, and even so, I had to do a little
begging myself. You owe me, country boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand flinched. Images of himself flashed in his head;
him tearing at her clothes, forcing himself on her like a mindless
beast. He owed her more than he could ever pay. Raking a hand
through his hair, he made himself turn to face her. She had tucked
her feet up so she sat cross-legged in the chair, leaning her fists
on her knees. How could she look at him so calmly? &ldquo;Min,
there&rsquo;s no excuse for what I did. If there was any justice
I&rsquo;d go to the gallows. If I could, I&rsquo;d put the rope
around my neck myself. On oath, I would.&rdquo; The words tasted bitter.
He was the Dragon Reborn, and she would have to wait on justice
until the Last Battle. What a fool he had been to want to live past
Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don. He did not deserve to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about, sheepherder?&rdquo; she said
slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking about what I did to you,&rdquo; he
groaned. How could he have done that, to anyone, but most of all to
her? &ldquo;Min, I know how hard it is for you to be in the same room
with me.&rdquo; How could he recall the soft feel of her so, the
silkiness of her skin? After he had torn her clothes off. &ldquo;I never
thought I was an animal, a monster.&rdquo; But he was. He loathed himself
for what he had done. And loathed himself worse because he wanted
to do it again. &ldquo;The only excuse I have is madness. Cadsuane was
right. I did hear voices. Lews Therin&rsquo;s voice, I thought. Can
you&mdash;? No. No, I have no right to ask you to forgive me. But
you have to know how sorry I am, Min.&rdquo; He was sorry. And his hands
ached to run down her bare back, over her hips. He <em>was</em> a
monster. &ldquo;Bitterly sorry. At least know that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sat there motionless, staring at him as if she
never before had seen his like. Now, she could stop pretending.
Now, she could say what she really thought of him, and however vile
it was, it would not be half vile enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;ve been keeping me
away,&rdquo; she said finally. &ldquo;You listen to me, you wooden-headed
numbskull. I was ready to cry myself to dust because I&rsquo;d seen
one death too many, and you, you were about to do the same for the
same reason. What we did, my innocent lamb, was comfort one
another. Friends comfort one another at times like that. Close your
mouth, you Two Rivers hay-hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did, but only to swallow. He thought his eyes were
going to fall onto the floorstones. He nearly spluttered getting
words out. &ldquo;<em>Comforted</em>? Min, if the Women&rsquo;s Circle
back home heard what we did called comforting, they&rsquo;d be
lining up to peel our hides if we were <em>fifty</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least it&rsquo;s &lsquo;we,&rsquo; now, instead of &lsquo;I,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; she said grimly. Rising smoothly, she advanced
toward him shaking a furious finger. &ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m a doll,
farmboy? Do you think I am too dimwitted to let you know if I
didn&rsquo;t want your touch? Do you think I couldn&rsquo;t let you
know in no uncertain terms?&rdquo; Her free hand produced a knife from
under her coat, gave it a flourish and tucked it back without
slowing the torrent. &ldquo;I remember ripping your shirt off your back
because you couldn&rsquo;t pull it over your head fast enough to
suit me. That&rsquo;s how little I wanted your arms around me! I did
with you what I&rsquo;ve never done with any man&mdash;and
don&rsquo;t you think I was never tempted!&mdash;and you say it was
all you! As if I wasn&rsquo;t even there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The back of his legs hit a chair, and he realized he
had been backing away from her. Frowning up at him, she muttered, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I like you looking down at me right now.&rdquo;
Abruptly she kicked him hard on the shin, planted both hands on his
chest, and shoved. He toppled into the chair so hard it nearly went
over backward. Ringlets swayed as she gave her head a toss and
adjusted her brocaded coat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as may be, Min, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as <em>is</em>, sheepherder,&rdquo; she cut in
firmly, &ldquo;and if you say different again, you had best shout for the
Maidens and channel for all you&rsquo;re worth, because I&rsquo;ll
thump you around this room till you squeal for mercy. You need a
shave. And a bath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand took a deep breath. Perrin had such a serene
marriage, with a smiling, gentle wife. Why was it that he always
seemed drawn to women who spun his head like a top? If only he knew
the tenth part of what Mat did about women, he would have known
what to say to all that, but as it was, all he could do was blunder
on. &ldquo;In any case,&rdquo; he said cautiously, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s only one thing
I can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what might that be?&rdquo; She folded her arms tight
beneath her breasts, and her foot began tapping ominously, but he
knew this was the right thing to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send you away.&rdquo; Just as he had Elayne, and Aviendha. &ldquo;If I had any self-control, I wouldn&rsquo;t have&mdash;&rdquo; That foot
started tapping faster. Maybe better to leave that alone.
Comforted? Light! &ldquo;Min, anyone close to me is in danger. The
Forsaken aren&rsquo;t the only ones who would harm somebody near me
just on the chance it might harm me, too. And now there&rsquo;s me,
as well. I can&rsquo;t control my temper anymore. Min, I nearly
killed Perrin! Cadsuane was right. I&rsquo;m going mad, or there
already. I have to send you away so you&rsquo;ll be safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is this Cadsuane?&rdquo; she said, so calmly that he
gave a start at noticing that her foot was still tapping. &ldquo;Alanna
mentioned that name as if she was the Creator&rsquo;s sister. No,
don&rsquo;t tell me; I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo; Not that she gave him one
hair of a gap to tell anything. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about Perrin,
either. You would hurt me as soon as him. I think that great public
fight of yours was a fake, is what I think. I don&rsquo;t care about
your temper, and I don&rsquo;t care whether you&rsquo;re mad. You
can&rsquo;t be very mad, or you&rsquo;d not be worrying about it so.
What I do care about&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She bent until those very big, very dark eyes were
level with his, not a great distance away, and suddenly there was
such a light glaring in them that he seized <em>saidin</em>, ready
to defend himself. &ldquo;Send me away to be safe?&rdquo; she growled. &ldquo;How
dare you? What right do you think you have to send me anywhere? You
need me, Rand al&rsquo;Thor! If I told you half the viewings
I&rsquo;ve had about you, half your hair would curl and the rest
fall out! You dare! You let the Maidens face any risk they want,
and you want to send me away like a child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t love the Maidens.&rdquo; Floating deep in the
emotionless Void, he heard those words spring from his tongue, and
shock shattered the emptiness and sent <em>saidin</em> flying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Min said, straightening. A small smile added
more curve to her lips. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s out of the way.&rdquo; And she sat
down on his lap.</p>

<p>She had said he would not hurt Perrin any more than
he would her, but he had to hurt her now. He had to, for her own
good. &ldquo;I love Elayne, too,&rdquo; he said brutally. &ldquo;And Aviendha. You
see what I am?&rdquo; For some reason, that did not seem to faze her at
all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rhuarc loves more than one woman,&rdquo; she said. Her
smile seemed almost of Aes Sedai serenity. &ldquo;So does Bael, and I
never noticed any Trolloc&rsquo;s horns on either. No, Rand, you
love me, and you can&rsquo;t back out of that. I ought to string you
up on tenterhooks for what you&rsquo;ve put me through, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Just so you&rsquo;ll know, I love you, too.&rdquo; The smile faded in a
frown of internal struggle, and finally she sighed. &ldquo;Life would be
a deal easier sometimes if my aunts hadn&rsquo;t brought me up to be
fair,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;And to be fair, Rand, I have to tell you that
Elayne loves you, too. So does Aviendha. If both of
Mandelain&rsquo;s wives can love him, I suppose three women can
manage to love you. But I&rsquo;m here, and if you try to send me
away, I&rsquo;ll tie myself to your leg.&rdquo; Her nose wrinkled. &ldquo;Once
you start bathing again, anyway. But I won&rsquo;t go, no matter
what.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just exactly like a top, his head spun. &ldquo;You&mdash;<em>love</em> me?&rdquo; he said incredulously. &ldquo;How do you know what
Elayne feels? How you know anything about Aviendha? Light!
Mandelain can do what he likes, Min; I&rsquo;m not Aiel.&rdquo; He
frowned. &ldquo;What was that you said about telling me half of what you
see? I thought you told me everything. And I am too sending you
somewhere safe. And stop doing your nose like that! I don&rsquo;t
smell!&rdquo; He jerked the hand he had been scratching with from under
his coat.</p>

<p>Her arched eyebrow spoke volumes, but of course her
tongue had to have its bit, too. &ldquo;You dare take that tone? Like you
don&rsquo;t believe it?&rdquo; Suddenly her voice began to rise by the
word, and she augured a finger against his chest as though she
meant to drive it through him. &ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;d go to <em>bed</em> with a man I did not love? Do you? Or maybe you think you
aren&rsquo;t worth loving? Is that it?&rdquo; She made a sound like a
stepped-on cat. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;m some little bit of fluff without a
brain in her head, falling in love with a worthless lout, am I? You
sit there gaping like a sick ox and slander my wits, my taste, my&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t quiet down and talk sense,&rdquo; he
growled, &ldquo;I swear, I&rsquo;ll smack your bottom!&rdquo; That leaped out of
nowhere, out of sleepless nights and confusion, but before he could
begin to form an apology, she smiled. The woman smiled!</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least you&rsquo;re not sulking anymore,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever whine, Rand; you are no good at it. Now, then. You
want sense? I love you, and I will not go. If you try to send me
away, I&rsquo;ll tell the Maidens you ruined me and cast me aside.
I&rsquo;ll tell everybody who will listen. I will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He raised his right hand and studied the flat of his
palm, where the branded heron stood clear, then looked at her. She
eyed his hand warily and shifted herself on his knees, then
conspicuously ignored everything except his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go, Rand,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;You need
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do it?&rdquo; he sighed, slumping back in the
chair. &ldquo;Even when you stand me on my head, you make all my troubles
shrink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min sniffed. &ldquo;You need to be stood on your head more
often. Tell me. This Aviendha. I don&rsquo;t suppose there is any
chance she&rsquo;s bony and scarred, like Nandera.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed in spite of himself. Light, how long since
he had laughed with pleasure? &ldquo;Min, I&rsquo;d say she is as pretty
as you, but how can you compare two sunrises?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment she stared at him with a small smile, as
if she could not decide whether to be surprised or delighted. &ldquo;You
are a very dangerous man, Rand al&rsquo;Thor,&rdquo; she murmured, leaning
toward him slowly. He thought he might fall into her eyes and be
lost. All those times before when she sat on his lap and kissed
him, all those times he had thought she was only teasing a country
boy, he had nearly crawled out of his skin wanting to kiss her
forever. Now, if she kissed him again now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Taking her firmly by the arms, he stood and set her
on her feet. He loved her, and she loved him, but he had to
remember that he wanted to kiss Elayne forever when he thought
about her, and Aviendha. Whatever Min said about Rhuarc or any
Aielman, she had made a poor bargain the day she fell in love with
him. &ldquo;You said half, Min,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;What viewings
haven&rsquo;t you told me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked up at him with what almost might have been
frustration, except of course that it could not have been. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in love with the Dragon Reborn, Min Farshaw,&rdquo; she
grumbled, &ldquo;and best you remember it. Best you did, too, Rand,&rdquo; she
added, pulling away. He let her go reluctantly, eagerly; he did not
know which. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been back in Cairhien half a week, and you
still have done nothing about the Sea Folk. Berelain thought you
might drag your feet again. She left me a letter, asking me to keep
reminding you, only you wouldn&rsquo;t let me&mdash;Well, never
mind that. Berelain thinks they&rsquo;re important to you somehow;
she says you&rsquo;re the fulfillment of some prophecy of
theirs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know all about that, Min. I&mdash;&rdquo; He had
thought to leave the Sea Folk out of being tangled with him; they
were not mentioned in the Prophecies of the Dragon that he could
find. But if he was going to let Min stay near him, let her risk
the dangers&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She had won, he realized. He had watched Elayne
walk away with his heart sinking, watched Aviendha go with his
stomach in knots. He could not do it again. Min stood there
waiting. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to their ship. I&rsquo;ll go today. The Sea
Folk can kneel to the Dragon Reborn in all his splendor. I
don&rsquo;t suppose there was ever any hope for anything else.
Either they&rsquo;re mine, or they&rsquo;re my enemies. That is how
it always seems to be. Will you tell me about those viewings,
now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand, you should study what they&rsquo;re like before
you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The viewings?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She folded her arms and frowned up at him through her
lashes. She chewed her lip and frowned at the door. She shook her
head and muttered under her breath. At last she said, &ldquo;There is
only one, really. I was exaggerating. I saw you and another man. I
couldn&rsquo;t make out either face, but I knew one was you. You
touched, and seemed to merge into one another, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Her
mouth tightened worriedly, and she went on in a very small voice. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it means, Rand, except that one of you
dies, and one doesn&rsquo;t. I&mdash;Why are you grinning? This
isn&rsquo;t a joke, Rand. I do not know which of you dies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m grinning because you&rsquo;ve given me very
good news,&rdquo; he said, touching her cheek. The other man had to be
Lews Therin. <em>I&rsquo;m not just insane and hearing voices</em>,
he thought, jubilant. One lived and one died, but he had known for
a long time that he was going to die. At least he was not mad. Or
not as far mad as he had feared. There was still the temper he
could barely control. &ldquo;You see, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly he realized that he had gone from touching
her cheek to cupping her face in both hands. He pulled them away as
if burned. Min pursed her lips and gave him a reproving look, but
he was not going to take advantage of her. It would not be fair to
her. Luckily, his stomach rumbled loudly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I need something to eat, if I&rsquo;m going to see
the Sea Folk. I saw a tray&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min made a sound more snort than sniff as he turned
away, but the next moment she was sailing toward the tall doors. &ldquo;You need a bath, if <em>we&rsquo;re</em> going to the Sea
Folk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nandera was delighted, nodding enthusiastically and
sending Maidens running. Though she did lean close to Min and say, &ldquo;I should have let you in the first day. I wanted to kick him, but
it is not done, kicking the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>.&rdquo; By her
tone, it should have been done. She spoke softly, yet not so softly
he could not hear. He was sure that was deliberate; she directed
too sharp a glare at him for it not to be.</p>

<p>Maidens lugged in the big copper tub themselves,
flashing handtalk once they set it down, laughing and too excited
to let the Sun Palace servants do the work, or bring in the stream
of buckets filled with hot water, either. Rand had a hard time
taking his own clothes off. For that matter, he had a hard time
washing himself, and he could not escape Nandera lathering his
hair. Flaxen-haired Somara and fiery-haired Enaila insisted on
shaving him as he sat chest-deep in the tub, concentrating so
intently they seemed afraid they might cut his throat. He was used
to that from other times they had refused to let him handle brush
and razor himself. He was used to the Maidens who stood around
watching, offering to scrub his back or his feet, hands flickering
in silent chatter and still more than half-scandalized at the sight
of someone <em>sitting</em> in water. Besides, he managed to get
rid of some, at least, by sending them off carrying orders.</p>

<p>What he was not used to was Min, sitting cross-legged
on the bed with her chin on her hands, watching the whole thing in
very evident fascination. In all the crowd of Maidens, he had not
realized she was there until he was naked, and all there was to do
then was sit down as fast as he could, splashing water over the
sides of the tub. The woman would have done very well as a Maiden
herself. She discussed him with the Maidens quite openly, with
never a blush! He was the one who blushed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is very modest,&rdquo; she said, agreeing with
Malindare, a woman more rounded than most Maidens, with the darkest
hair Rand had seen on any Aiel. &ldquo;Modesty is a man&rsquo;s crowning
glory.&rdquo; Malindare nodded soberly, but Min wore a grin that nearly
split her cheeks.</p>

<p>And, &ldquo;Oh, no, Domeille; it would be a shame to spoil
such a pretty face with a scar.&rdquo; Domeille, grayer than Nandera,
leaner, and with a thrusting chin, insisted that he was not pretty
enough to do without a scar to set off what beauty he had. Her
words. The rest was worse. The Maidens had always seemed to enjoy
making his face red. Min certainly did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have to dry off sooner or later, Rand,&rdquo; she
said, holding up a long piece of white toweling with both hands.
She stood a good three paces from the tub, and the Maidens had all
backed into a watching ring. Min&rsquo;s smile was so innocent any
magistrate would have found her guilty on that alone. &ldquo;Come and get
dry, Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had never been so relieved to pull on clothes in
his life.</p>

<p>By that time, all his orders had been carried out,
and everything was in readiness. Rand al&rsquo;Thor might have been
routed in a bathtub, but the Dragon Reborn was going to the Sea
Folk in a style that would send them plummeting to their knees with
awe.</p>
