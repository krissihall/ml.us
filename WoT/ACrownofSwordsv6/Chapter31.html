the boat swept away from the landing, Nynaeve
tossed her mask down beside her on the cushioned bench and slumped
back with arms folded and braid gripped firmly, scowling at
nothing. Scowling at everything. Listening to the Wind still told
her a fierce storm was on the way, the kind that tore off roofs and
flattened barns, and she almost wished the river would begin to
kick up in waves right that minute.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t the weather, Nynaeve,&rdquo; she
mimicked, &ldquo;then you should be the one to go. The Mistress of the
Ships might be insulted if we didn&rsquo;t send the strongest of us.
They know Aes Sedai put great store in that. Bah!&rdquo; That had been
Elayne. Except for the &ldquo;bah.&rdquo; Elayne just thought putting up with
any amount of nonsense from Merilille would be preferable to facing
Nesta again. Once you began badly with someone, it was hard to
recover&mdash;Mat Cauthon was proof enough of that!&mdash;and if
they had gotten off any worse with Nesta din Reas Two Moons, she
would be sending the lot of them to fetch and carry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Horrible woman!&rdquo; she grumbled, shifting around on
the seat cushions. Aviendha had been no better when Nynaeve
suggested she go to the Sea Folk; those people had been fascinated
by her. She pitched her voice high and finicky, not at all like
Aviendha&rsquo;s, but the mood fit. &ldquo;We will learn of this trouble
when we learn, Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara. Perhaps I will learn
something watching Jaichim Carridin today.&rdquo; If not for the fact
that nothing whatsoever frightened the Aiel woman, she would have
thought Aviendha fearful from her eagerness to spy on Carridin. A
day standing in a hot street jostled by crowds was not amusing, and
today would be worse, with the festival. Nynaeve would have thought
the woman would enjoy a nice refreshing boat ride.</p>

<p>The boat lurched. A nice refreshing boat ride, she
told herself. Nice cool breezes on the bay. Moist breezes, not dry.
The boat rolled. &ldquo;Oh, blood and ashes!&rdquo; she moaned. Appalled, she
clapped a hand over her mouth and drummed her heels against the
front of the bench in righteous outrage. If she had to endure those
Sea Folk for long, she would have as much filth coming off of her
tongue as Mat did. She did not want to think about him. One more
day folding her hands for that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that <em>man</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and
she would yank every hair out of her head! Not that he had demanded
anything unreasonable so far, but she kept waiting for him to, and
his manner&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she said firmly. &ldquo;I want to settle my stomach,
not rile it.&rdquo; The boat had begun a slow rocking. She tried to
concentrate on her clothes. She was not fixated on clothes the way
Elayne sometimes seemed to be, but thinking about silks and laces
was soothing.</p>

<p>Everything had been chosen to impress the Mistress of
the Ships, to try regaining a little lost ground, for all the good
it might do. Green silk slashed with yellow in the skirts,
embroidered in gold down the sleeves and across the bodice, with
golden lace along the hem, and at her wrists, and just bordering
the neckline. Perhaps that should have been higher, to be taken
seriously, but she did not own anything higher. Considering Sea
Folk customs, it was more than modest. Nesta would have to take her
as she was; Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara did not go changing herself for
anyone.</p>

<p>The yellow opal pins stuck in her braid were her own&mdash;a present from the Panarch of Tarabon, no less&mdash;but
Tylin had provided the gold necklace that fanned emeralds and
pearls down to her bosom. A richer piece than she had ever dreamed
of owning; a gift for bringing Mat, Tylin had called it, which made
no sense at all, but maybe the Queen thought she needed some excuse
for such a valuable present. Both gold-and-ivory bracelets came
from Aviendha, who had a surprising little stock of jewelry for a
woman who so seldom wore more than that one silver necklace.
Nynaeve had asked to borrow that pretty roses-and-thorns ivory
bracelet that the Aiel woman never wore; surprisingly, Aviendha had
snatched it to her bosom as if it was her most precious possession,
and of all things, Elayne began comforting her. Nynaeve would not
have been surprised to see the pair fall weeping on one
another&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>

<p>There was something odd going on there, and if she
had not known those two were too sensible for such nonsense, she
would have suspected a man at the root of it. Well, Aviendha was
too sensible; Elayne did still yearn for Rand, though Nynaeve could
hardly fault her for&mdash;</p>

<p>Suddenly she felt weaves of <em>saidar</em> almost
atop her in huge amounts, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she floundered in salty water over her head,
flailing upward to find air, tangled in her skirts, flailing. Her
head broke surface, and she gasped for breath amid floating
cushions, staring in astonishment. After a moment, she recognized
the slanting shape above her as one of the cabin seats, and a bit
of the cabin wall. She was inside a trapped pocket of air. Not
large; she could have touched both sides without stretching her
arms out fully. But how&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? An audible thud announced the bottom
of the river; the upside-down cabin, lurched, tilted. She thought
the air pocket shrank a little.</p>

<p>The first order of business, before wondering about
anything, was getting out before she used up the air. She knew how
to swim&mdash;she had splashed in the Waterwood ponds often enough
back home&mdash;it was just when the water started rocking her
about that she minded. Filling her lungs, she doubled over and swam
down toward where the door must be, kicking awkwardly because of
her skirts. It might help to shed the dress, but she was not about
to bob to the surface of the river in nothing but shift and
stockings and jewels. She was not about to leave those behind,
either. Besides, she could not get out of the dress without loosing
her belt pouch, and she would drown before losing what was in
there.</p>

<p>The water was black, lightless. Her outstretched
fingers struck wood, and she felt across the piercework carving
until she found the door, scrabbled down the edge of that&mdash;and found a hinge. Muttering imprecations in her head, she
cautiously felt her way to the other side. Yes! The latch handle!
She lifted it, pushed outward. The door moved maybe two inches&mdash;and stopped.</p>

<p>Lungs straining, she swam back up to the pocket, but
only long enough to fill them again. This time, finding the door
came faster. She stuck her fingers through the crack to find what
held the door shut. They sank into mud. Maybe she could dig away a
little hillock, or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She felt higher. More mud. Increasingly
frantic, she worked her fingers from the bottom of the crack to the
top, and then, refusing to believe, from the top to the bottom.
Mud, solid gooey mud, all the way.</p>

<p>This time when she swam back up to the pocket, she
grabbed hold of the edge of the seat above her and hung from it,
panting, heart beating wildly. The air felt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;thicker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not die here,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;I will not die
here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hammered a fist against the seat until she felt
it bruise, fighting for the anger that would allow her to channel.
She would not die. Not here. Alone. No one would know where she had
died. No grave, just a corpse rotting at the bottom of the river.
Her arm fell with a splash. She labored for breath. Flecks of black
and silver danced in her eyes; she seemed to be looking down a
tube. No anger, she realized dimly. She kept trying to reach for
<em>saidar</em>, but without any belief that she would touch it,
now. She was going to die here after all. No hope. No Lan. And with
hope gone, flickering on the edge of consciousness like a guttering
candle flame, she did something she had never done before in her
life. She surrendered completely.</p>

<p><em>Saidar</em> flowed into her, filled her.</p>

<p>She was only half-aware of the wood above her
suddenly bulging outward, bursting. In rushing bubbles of air she
drifted up, out through the hole in the hull into darkness.
Vaguely, she knew she should do something. She could almost
remember what. Yes. Her feet kicked weakly; she tried to move her
arms to swim. They seemed to just float.</p>

<p>Something seized her dress, and panic roused her in
thoughts of sharks, and lionfish, and the Light alone knew what
else that might inhabit these black depths. A spark of
consciousness spoke of the Power, but she flailed desperately with
fists and feet, felt her knuckles land solidly. Unfortunately, she
also screamed, or tried to. A great quantity of water rushing down
her throat washed away scream, <em>saidar</em>, and very nearly her
final scraps of awareness.</p>

<p>Something tugged on her braid, then again, and she
was being towed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;somewhere. She was no longer conscious enough
to struggle, or even to be very much afraid of being eaten.</p>

<p>Abruptly her head broke surface. Hands encircled her
from behind&mdash;hands; not a shark, after all&mdash;squeezed
hard against her ribs in a most familiar way. She coughed&mdash;water spewed from her nose&mdash;coughed again, painfully. And
drew a shuddering breath. She had never tasted anything so sweet in
her life.</p>

<p>A hand cupped her chin, and suddenly she was being
towed again. Lassitude washed though her. All she could do was
float on her back, and breathe, and stare up at the sky. So blue.
So beautiful. The stinging in her eyes was not all from the salty
river.</p>

<p>And then she was being pushed upward against the side
of a boat, a rude hand beneath her bottom shoving her higher, until
two lanky fellows with brass rings in their ears could reach down
and haul her aboard. They helped her walk a step or two, but as
soon as they let go to help her rescuer, her legs collapsed like
towers of soggy mush.</p>

<p>On unsteady hands and knees, she stared blankly at a
sword and boots and green coat someone had thrown down on the deck.
She opened her mouth&mdash;and emptied herself of the River Elbar.
The entire river, it seemed, plus her midday meal, and her
breakfast; it would not have surprised her at all to see a few
fish, or her slippers. She was wiping her lips with the back of her
hand when she became aware of voices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord is all right? My Lord was down for a very
long time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forget me, man,&rdquo; said a deep voice. &ldquo;Get something
to wrap around the lady.&rdquo; Lan&rsquo;s voice, that she dreamed every
night of hearing.</p>

<p>Wide-eyed, Nynaeve barely bit back a wail; the horror
she had felt when she thought she was going to die was nothing
alongside what flashed through her now. Nothing! This was a
nightmare. Not now! Not like this! Not when she was a drowned rat,
kneeling with the contents of her stomach spread out before
her!</p>

<p>Without thought she embraced <em>saidar</em> and
channeled. Water fell away from her clothes, her hair, in a rush
and washed all evidence of her little mishap out through a scupper
hole. Scrambling to her feet, she hurriedly pulled her necklace
aright and did her best to straighten her dress and hair, but the
soaking in salt water and then the rapid drying had left several
stains on the silk and a number of creases that would require a
knowledgeable hand with a hot iron to remove. Wisps of hair wanted
to fly away from her scalp, and the opals in her braid seemed to
dot the bristling tail of an angry cat.</p>

<p>It did not matter. She was calmness itself, cool as
an early spring breeze, self-possessed as&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She spun around
before he could come on her from behind and startle her into
disgracing herself completely.</p>

<p>She only realized how quickly she had moved when she
saw that Lan was just then taking his second step from the railing.
He was the most beautiful man she had ever seen. Soaking wet in
shirt and breeches and stockings, he was gorgeous, with his
dripping hair clinging to the angles of his face, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;A split
purple bruise was rising on his face, as from a blow. She clapped a
hand to her mouth, remembering her fist connecting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! Oh, Lan, I&rsquo;m so sorry! I didn&rsquo;t
mean to!&rdquo; She was not really aware of crossing the space between
them; she was just there, stretching up on toetips to lay fingers
gently on his injury. A deft weave of all Five Powers, and his
tanned cheek was unblemished. But he might have been hurt
elsewhere. She spun the weaves to Delve him; new scars made her
wince inside, and there was something odd, but he seemed healthy as
a prime bull. He was also very wet, from saving her. She dried him
as she had herself; water splashed around his feet. She could not
stop touching him. Both hands traced his hard cheeks, his wonderful
blue eyes, his strong nose, his firm lips, his ears. She combed
that silky black hair into place with her fingers, adjusted the
braided leather band that held it. Her tongue seemed to have a life
of its own, too. &ldquo;Oh, Lan,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;You really are here.&rdquo;
Somebody giggled. Not her&mdash;Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara did not
giggle&mdash;but somebody did. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a dream. Oh, Light,
you&rsquo;re here. How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A servant at the Tarasin Palace told me you&rsquo;d
gone to the river, and a fellow at the landing said what boat you
had taken. If Mandarb hadn&rsquo;t lost a shoe, I would have been
here yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. You&rsquo;re here now. You&rsquo;re
here.&rdquo; She did not giggle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe she is Aes Sedai,&rdquo; one of the boatmen
murmured, not quite low enough, &ldquo;but I still say she&rsquo;s one
duckling who means to stuff herself in that wolf&rsquo;s jaws.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s face flashed pure scarlet, and she
snatched her hands to her sides, her heels thumping to the deck.
Another time, she would have given the fellow what for, and no
mistake. Another time, when she could think. Lan crowded everything
else out of her head. She seized his arm. &ldquo;We can talk more
privately in the cabin.&rdquo; Had one of the oarsmen snickered?</p>

<p>&ldquo;My sword and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring it,&rdquo; she said, snatching up his
things from the deck on flows of Air. One of those louts <em>had</em> snickered. Another flow of Air pulled open the cabin door,
and she hustled Lan and his sword and the rest inside and slammed
it behind them.</p>

<p>Light, she doubted if even Calle Coplin back home had
ever been as bold as this, and as many merchants&rsquo; guards knew
Calle&rsquo;s birthmark as knew her face. But it was not the same at
all! Not at all! Still, no harm in being just a tad less&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;eager. Her hands went back to his face&mdash;only to straighten
his hair some more; just that&mdash;and he caught her wrists
gently in his big hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Myrelle holds my bond, now,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;She
is lending me to you until you find a Warder of your own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Calmly pulling her right hand free, she slapped his
face as hard as she could swing. His head hardly moved, so she
freed the other hand and slapped him harder with that. &ldquo;How could
you?&rdquo; For good measure, she punctuated the question with another
slap. &ldquo;You knew I was waiting!&rdquo; One more seemed called for, just to
drive the point home. &ldquo;How could you do such a thing? How could you
let her?&rdquo; Another slap. &ldquo;Burn you, Lan Mandragoran! Burn you! Burn
you! Burn you to the Pit of Doom! Burn you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man&mdash;the <em>bloody</em> man!&mdash;did
not say one word. Not that he could, of course; what defense could
he offer? He just stood there while she rained blows at him, making
no move, unblinking eyes looking peculiar, as well they might with
the way she reddened his cheeks for him. If her slaps made little
impression on him, though, the palms of her hands began to sting
like fury.</p>

<p>Grimly, she clenched a fist and punched him in the
belly with all her might. He grunted. Slightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will talk this over calmly and rationally,&rdquo; she
said, stepping back from him. &ldquo;As adults.&rdquo; Lan just nodded and sat
down and pulled his boots over to him! Pushing bits of hair out of
her face with her left hand, she stuck the right behind her so she
could flex her sore fingers without him seeing. He had no right
being that hard, not when she wanted to hit him. Too much to hope
she had cracked a rib in him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should thank her, Nynaeve.&rdquo; How could the man
sound so calm! Stamping his foot firmly into one boot, he bent to
pick up the other, not looking at her. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t want me
bonded to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The flow of Air seized a handful of his hair arid
bent his head up painfully. &ldquo;If you dare&mdash;if you even dare&mdash;to spout that drivel about not wanting to give me a
widow&rsquo;s weeds, Lan Mandragoran, I&rsquo;ll&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She could not think of anything strong enough. Kicking him was
not near enough. Myrelle. Myrelle and her Warders. Burn him!
Removing his hide in strips would not be enough!</p>

<p>He might as well not have been bent over with his
neck craned. He just rested his forearms across his knees, and
watched her with that odd look in his eyes, and said, &ldquo;I thought
about not telling you, but you have a right to know.&rdquo; Even so, his
tone became hesitant; Lan was never hesitant. &ldquo;When Moiraine died&mdash;when a Warder&rsquo;s bond to his Aes Sedai is snapped&mdash;there are changes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he continued, her arms snaked around herself,
hugging tightly to keep her from shivering. Her jaw ached, for she
kept it clamped shut. She released the flow holding him as if a
hand springing away, released <em>saidar</em>, but he only
straightened and went on relating this horror without so much as a
flinch, went on watching her. Suddenly she understood his eyes,
colder than winter&rsquo;s heart. The eyes of a man who knew he was
dead and could not make himself care, a man waiting, almost eager,
for that long sleep. Her own eyes stung with not weeping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you see,&rdquo; he concluded with a smile that touched
only his mouth; an accepting smile, &ldquo;when it&rsquo;s done, she will
have a year or more of pain, and I will still be dead. You are
spared that. My last gift to you, <em>Mashiara</em>.&rdquo; <em>Mashiara</em>. His lost love.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are to be my Warder until I find one?&rdquo; Her voice
startled her with its levelness. She could not break down in tears
now. She would not. Now, more than ever before, she had to gather
all her strength.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said cautiously, tugging on his other boot
He had always seemed something of a half-tame wolf, and his eyes
made him seem much less than half tame now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; Adjusting her skirts, she resisted the urge
to cross the cabin to him. She could not let him see her fear. &ldquo;Because I have found him. You. I waited and wished with Moiraine;
I won&rsquo;t with Myrelle. She is going to give me your bond.&rdquo;
Myrelle would, if she had to drag the woman to Tar Valon and back
by her hair. For that matter, she might drag her just for the
principle of it. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say anything,&rdquo; she said sharply when
he opened his mouth. Her fingers brushed her belt pouch, where his
heavy gold signet ring lay wrapped in a silk handkerchief. With an
effort, she moderated her tone; he was ill, and harsh words never
helped sickness. It was an effort, though; she wanted to berate him
up one side and down the other, wanted to pull her braid out by the
roots every time she thought of him and that woman. Fighting to
keep her voice calm, she went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the Two Rivers, Lan, when somebody gives another
a ring, they are betrothed.&rdquo; That was a lie, and she half-expected
him to jump to his feet in outrage, but he only blinked warily.
Besides, she had read about the notion in a story. &ldquo;We have been
betrothed long enough. We are going to be married today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I used to pray for that,&rdquo; he said softly, then shook
his head. &ldquo;You know why it can&rsquo;t be, Nynaeve. And even if it
could, Myrelle&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite all her promises to keep her temper, to be
gentle, she embraced <em>saidar</em> and stuffed a gag of Air into
his mouth before he could confess what she did not want to hear. So
long as he did not confess, she could pretend nothing had happened.
When she got hold of Myrelle, though! Opals pressed hard into her
palm, and her hand leaped from her braid as if burned. She occupied
her fingers with brushing his hair again while he glared at her
indignantly above his gaping mouth. &ldquo;A small lesson for you in the
difference between wives and other women,&rdquo; she said lightly. Such a
struggle. &ldquo;I would appreciate it very much if you did not mention
Myrelle&rsquo;s name again in my presence. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He nodded, and she released the flow, but as soon as
he had worked his jaw a moment, he said, &ldquo;Naming no names, Nynaeve,
you know she&rsquo;s aware of everything I feel, through the bond.
If we were man and wife&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She thought her face might burst into flame. She had
never thought of that! Bloody Myrelle! &ldquo;Is there any way to make
sure she knows it is me?&rdquo; she said finally, and her cheeks nearly
did flash to fire. Especially when he fell back against the cabin
wall laughing in astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light, Nynaeve, you are a hawk! Light! I
haven&rsquo;t laughed since&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; His mirth faded, the coldness
that had dimmed in his eyes for an instant returning. &ldquo;I do wish it
could be, Nynaeve, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can and will,&rdquo; she broke in. Men always seemed to
get the upper hand if you let them talk too long. She plumped
herself down on his knees. They were not married yet, true, but he
was softer than the unpadded benches on this boat. She shifted a
bit to make herself more comfortable. Well, no harder than the
benches, anyway. &ldquo;You might as well reconcile yourself, Lan
Mandragoran. My heart belongs to you, and you&rsquo;ve admitted
yours belongs to me. <em>You</em> belong to me, and I will not let
you go. You will be my Warder, and my husband, and for a very long
time. I will not let you die. Do you understand <em>that</em>? I
can be as stubborn as I have to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t noticed,&rdquo; he said, and her eyes
narrowed. His tone sounded awfully&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;dry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As long as you do now,&rdquo; she said firmly. Twisting
her neck, she peered through the piercework in the hull behind him,
then craned around to peer through the carving at the front of the
cabin. Long stone docks thrusting out from the stone quay passed
by; all she could see ahead were more docks, and the city gleaming
white in the afternoon sun. &ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo; she muttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told them to put us ashore as soon as I had you
aboard,&rdquo; Lan said. &ldquo;It seemed best to get off the river as fast as
possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; She clamped her teeth shut. He had not
known where she was headed or why; he had done the best he could
with what he did know. And he <em>had</em> saved her life. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t go back to the city yet, Lan.&rdquo; Clearing her throat, she
changed her tone. However gentle she had to be with him, that much
syrup would make her sick up all over again. &ldquo;I have to go to the
Sea Folk ships, to <em>Windrunner</em>.&rdquo; Much better; light, but
not too light, and firm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve, I was right behind your boat. I saw what
happened. You were fifty paces ahead of me, and then fifty paces
behind, sinking. It had to be balefire.&rdquo; He did not need to say
more; she said it for him, and with more knowledge than he had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moghedien,&rdquo; she breathed. Oh, it could have been
another of the Forsaken, or one of the Black Ajah perhaps, but she
knew. Well, she had beaten Moghedien not once, but twice. She could
do so a third time, if necessary. Her face must not have shared her
confidence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; Lan said, touching her cheek. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever be afraid while I&rsquo;m near. If you have to face
Moghedien, I&rsquo;ll make sure you are angry enough to channel. I
seem to have some talent in that direction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never make me angry again,&rdquo; she began,
and stopped, staring at him wide-eyed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not angry,&rdquo; she
said slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not now, but when you need to be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not angry,&rdquo; she laughed. She kicked her
feet in delight, and pounded her fists on his chest, laughing.
<em>Saidar</em> filled her, not just with life and joy, but this time, with
awe. With feathery flows of Air, she stroked his cheeks. &ldquo;I am not
angry, Lan,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your block is gone.&rdquo; He grinned, sharing her
delight, but the grin put no warmth into his eyes.</p>

<p><em>I will take care of you, Lan Mandragoran</em>,
she promised silently. <em>I will not let you die</em>. Leaning on
his chest, she thought of kissing him, and even&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>You are
not Calle Coplin</em>, she told herself firmly.</p>

<p>A sudden, horrible thought struck her. All the more
horrible because it had not come earlier. &ldquo;The boatmen?&rdquo; she said
quietly. &ldquo;My bodyguards?&rdquo; Wordlessly, he shook his head, and she
sighed. Bodyguards. Light, they had needed her protection, not the
other way around. Four more deaths to lay at Moghedien&rsquo;s feet.
Four on top of thousands, but these were personal, as far she was
concerned. Well, she was not about to settle Moghedien this
moment.</p>

<p>Getting to her feet, she began seeing what she could
do about her clothes. &ldquo;Lan, will you turn the boatmen around? Tell
them to row for all they have.&rdquo; As it was, she would not see the
palace again before nightfall. &ldquo;And find out if one of them has
such a thing as a comb.&rdquo; She could not face Nesta like this.</p>

<p>He picked up his coat and sword and gave her a bow. &ldquo;As you command, Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pursing her lips, she watched the door close behind
him. Laughing at her, was he? She would wager someone on <em>Windrunner</em> could perform a marriage. And from what she had
seen of the Sea Folk, she would wager Lan Mandragoran would find
himself promising to do as he was told. They would see who laughed
then.</p>

<p>Lurching and rolling, the boat began to swing around,
and her stomach lurched with it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Light!&rdquo; she groaned, sinking onto the bench. Why
could she not have lost that along with her block? Holding <em>saidar</em>, aware of every touch of the air on her skin, only made
it worse. Letting go did not help. She was <em>not</em> going to
sick up again. She <em>was</em> going to make Lan hers once and for
all. This was going to be a wonderful day yet. If only she could
stop feeling that storm on the way.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The sun sat luridly just above the rooftops by the
time Elayne rapped on the door with her knuckles. Revelers danced
and cavorted in the street behind her, filling the air with
laughter and song and the scent of perfume. Idly, she wished she
had had a chance really to enjoy the festival. A costume like
Birgitte&rsquo;s might have been fun. Or even one like that she had
seen on the Lady Riselle, one of Tylin&rsquo;s attendants, first
thing this morning. As long as she could have kept her mask on. She
rapped again, harder.</p>

<p>The gray-haired, square-jawed maid opened the door,
fury suddenly painting her face when Elayne lowered her green mask. &ldquo;You! What are you doing back&mdash;?&rdquo; Fury turned to ghastly
paleness as Merilille removed her mask, and Adeleas and the others
did the same. The woman jerked with each ageless face revealed, and
even with Sareitha&rsquo;s. By that time, maybe she saw what she
expected to see.</p>

<p>With a sudden cry, the maid tried to push the door
shut, but Birgitte darted past Elayne, her feathered shoulder
knocking it back open. The servant staggered a few steps, then
gathered herself, but whether to run or shout, Birgitte was there
before time, gripping her arm just below the shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy,&rdquo; Birgitte said firmly. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want any
fuss or shouting, now do we?&rdquo; It did seem she was only holding the
woman&rsquo;s arm, almost supporting her, but the maid stood very
straight indeed and very still. Staring wide-eyed at her
captor&rsquo;s plume-crested mask, she shook her head slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; Elayne asked, as everyone
crowded into the entry hall behind her. The closing door muted the
noise from outside. The maid&rsquo;s eyes darted from one face to
the next as if she could not bear to gaze at any one for long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;C-c-cedora.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will take us to Reanne, Cedora.&rdquo; This time,
Cedora nodded; she looked about to cry.</p>

<p>Cedora stiffly led the way upstairs with Birgitte
still holding her arm. Elayne considered telling her to release the
woman, but the last thing she wanted was a shouted alarm and
everyone in the house fleeing in all directions. That was why
Birgitte used muscle instead of Elayne herself channeling. She
thought Cedora was more frightened than hurt, and everybody was to
be at least a little frightened this evening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In th-there,&rdquo; Cedora said, nodding to a red door.
The door to the room where Nynaeve and she had had that unfortunate
interview. She opened it and went in.</p>

<p>Reanne was there, seated with the fireplace carved
with the Thirteen Sins at her back, and so were another dozen women
Elayne had never seen before, occupying all of the chairs against
the pale green walls, sweating with the windows tight and curtains
drawn. Most wore Ebou Dari dresses, though only one possessed the
olive skin; most had lines on their faces and at least a touch of
gray; and every last woman of them could channel to one degree or
another. Seven wore the red belt. She sighed in spite of herself.
When Nynaeve was right, she let you know it until you wanted to
scream.</p>

<p>Reanne bounded to her feet in the same red-faced fury
Cedora had shown, and her first words were almost identical as
well. &ldquo;You! How dare you show your face&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; Words and fury
drained away together for the same reason, too, as Merilille and
the others entered on Elayne&rsquo;s heels. A yellow-haired woman in
red belt and plunging neckline made a faint sound as her eyes
rolled up in her head and she slid bonelessly from her red chair.
No one moved to help her. No one even glanced at Birgitte as she
escorted Cedora to a corner and planted her there. No one seemed to
breathe. Elayne felt a great desire to shout &ldquo;boo&rdquo; just to see what
would happen.</p>

<p>Reanne swayed, white-faced, and visibly tried to
gather herself with slight success. It took her only a moment to
scan the five cool-faced Aes Sedai lined up before the door and
decide who must be in charge. She wobbled across the floortiles to
Merilille and sank to her knees, head bowed. &ldquo;Forgive us, Aes
Sedai.&rdquo; Her voice was worshipful, and only a little steadier than
her knees had been. She babbled, in fact. &ldquo;We are only a few
friends. We have done nothing, certainly nothing to bring discredit
to Aes Sedai. I swear that, whatever this girl has told you. We
would have told you of her, but we were afraid. We only meet to
talk. She has a friend, Aes Sedai. Did you catch her, too? I can
describe her for you, Aes Sedai. Whatever you wish, we will do. I
swear, we&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Merilille cleared her throat loudly. &ldquo;Your name is
Reanne Corly, I believe?&rdquo; Reanne flinched and whispered that it
was, still peering at the floor at the Gray sister&rsquo;s feet. &ldquo;I
fear you must address yourself to Elayne Sedai, Reanne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reanne&rsquo;s head jerked up in a <em>most</em> satisfactory
way. She stared at Merilille, then by slow increments turned eyes
as big as her face to Elayne. She licked her lips. She drew a deep,
long breath. Twisting around on her knees to face Elayne, she bowed
her head once more. &ldquo;I beg your forgiveness, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; she said
leadenly. &ldquo;I did not know. I could not&mdash;&rdquo; Another long,
hopeless breath. &ldquo;Whatever punishment you decree, we accept humbly,
of course, but please, I beg you to believe that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, stand up,&rdquo; Elayne broke in impatiently. She had
wanted to make this woman acknowledge her as much as she had
Merilille or any of the others, but the groveling sickened her. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Stand on your feet.&rdquo; She waited until Reanne
complied, then walked over and sat in the woman&rsquo;s chair. There
was no need for cringing, but she wanted no doubts who was in
charge. &ldquo;Do you still deny knowledge of the Bowl of the Winds,
Reanne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reanne spread her hands. &ldquo;Aes Sedai,&rdquo; she said
guilelessly, &ldquo;none of us would ever use a <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, much less an <em>angreal</em>
or <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>.&rdquo; Guileless, and wary as a fox in a
city. &ldquo;I assure you, we make no pretense of being anything even
near to Aes Sedai. We are just these few friends you see, tied
together by once having been allowed to enter the White Tower. That
is all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just these few friends,&rdquo; Elayne said dryly over
steepled fingers. &ldquo;And Garenia, of course. And Berowin, and Derys,
and Alise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Reanne said reluctantly. &ldquo;And them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne shook her head very slowly. &ldquo;Reanne, the White
Tower knows about your Kin. The Tower has <em>always</em> known.&rdquo; A
dark woman with a Tairen look to her, though wearing a
blue-and-white silk vest with the sigil of the goldsmith&rsquo;s
guild, gave a strangled scream and pressed both plump hands to her
mouth. A lean, graying Saldaean wearing the red belt crumpled with
a sigh to join the yellow-haired woman on the floor, and two more
swayed as if they might.</p>

<p>For her part, Reanne looked to the sisters in front
of the door for confirmation, and saw it, as she thought.
Merilille&rsquo;s face was more icy than serene, and Sareitha
grimaced before she could stop herself. Vandene and Careane were
both tight-lipped, and even Adeleas seemed included, turning her
head this way and that to study the women along the walls as she
might have insects previously unknown to her. Of course, what
Reanne saw and what was were not the same. They had all accepted
Elayne&rsquo;s decision, but no amount of &ldquo;Yes, Elayne&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; could
make them like it. They would have been here two hours ago if not
for a great deal of &ldquo;But, Elayne&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; tossed in. Sometimes
leading meant herding.</p>

<p>Reanne did not faint, but fear filled her face, and
she raised pleading hands. &ldquo;Do you mean to destroy the Kin? Why
now, after so long? What have we done that you should come down on
us now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one will destroy you,&rdquo; Elayne told her. &ldquo;Careane,
since nobody else is going to help those two, would you, please?&rdquo;
Jumps and blushes ran around the room, and before Careane could
move, two women were crouching over each one who had fainted,
lifting her up and waving smelling salts under her nose. &ldquo;The
Amyrlin Seat desires every woman who can channel to be connected to
the Tower,&rdquo; Elayne went on. &ldquo;The offer is open to any of the Kin
who wish to accept.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Had she woven flows of Air around every one of those
women, she could not have frozen them more still. Had she squeezed
those flows tight, she could not have produced more bulging eyes.
One of the women who had fainted suddenly gasped and coughed,
pushing away the tiny vial of salts that had been held still too
long. That broke everyone free in a deluge of voices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can become Aes Sedai after all?&rdquo; the Tairen in
the goldsmith&rsquo;s vest asked excitedly, at the same time that a
round-faced woman with a red belt at least twice as long as anyone
else&rsquo;s burst out with, &ldquo;They will let us learn? They will
teach us again?&rdquo; A deluge of painfully eager voices. &ldquo;We can really&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; and &ldquo;They will let us&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; from every side.</p>

<p>Reanne rounded on them fiercely. &ldquo;Ivara, Sumeko, all
of you, you forget yourselves! You speak in front of Aes Sedai! You
speak in&mdash;front of&mdash;Aes Sedai.&rdquo; She passed a hand over
her face, trembling. An embarrassed silence descended. Eyes fell
and blushes rose. With all those lined faces, all that gray and
white hair, Elayne still was minded of nothing so much as a group
of novices having a pillow-fight after Last had tolled when the
Mistress of Novices walked in.</p>

<p>Hesitantly, Reanne looked at her across her
fingertips. &ldquo;We truly will be allowed to return to the Tower?&rdquo; she
mumbled into her hand.</p>

<p>Elayne nodded. &ldquo;Those who can learn to become Aes
Sedai will have the chance, and there will be a place for all. For
any woman who channels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unshed tears shone in Reanne&rsquo;s eyes. Elayne was
not sure, but she thought the woman whispered, &ldquo;I can be Green.&rdquo; It
was hard not to rush over and throw her arms around her.</p>

<p>None of the other Aes Sedai showed any signs of
giving way to emotion, and Merilille certainly was of sterner
stuff. &ldquo;If I may ask a question, Elayne? Reanne, how many&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;of
you will we be taking in?&rdquo; Doubtless that pause covered a change
from &ldquo;how many wilders and failures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If Reanne noticed or suspected, she ignored it or did
not care. &ldquo;I cannot believe there are any who would refuse the
offer,&rdquo; she said breathlessly. &ldquo;It may take some time to send word
to everyone. We remain spread out, you see, so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She laughed,
a touch nervously and still not far from tears. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;so Aes
Sedai would not notice us. At present there are one thousand seven
hundred and eighty-three names on the roll.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Most Aes Sedai learned to cover shock with an outward
show of calm, and only Sareitha allowed her eyes to widen. She also
mouthed silent words, but Elayne knew her well enough to read her
lips. <em>Two thousand wilders! Light help us!</em> Elayne made a
great show of adjusting her skirts until she was sure her own face
was under control. Light help them, indeed.</p>

<p>Reanne misunderstood the silence. &ldquo;You expected more?
Accidents do take some every year, or natural deaths, as with
everyone else, and I fear the Kin have grown fewer in the last
thousand years. Perhaps we have been too cautious in approaching
women when they leave the White Tower, but there has always been
the fear that one of them might report being questioned, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are not disappointed in the least,&rdquo; Elayne
assured her, making soothing gestures. Disappointed? She very
nearly giggled hysterically. There were nearly twice as many
Kinswomen as there were Aes Sedai! Egwene could never say she had
not done her part to bring women who could channel to the Tower.
But if the Kin refused wilders&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She must stick to the point;
conscripting the Kin had only been incidental. &ldquo;Reanne,&rdquo; she said
gently, &ldquo;do you think perhaps you might happen to recall where the
Bowl of the Winds is, now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reanne blushed a sunset. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never touched
them, Elayne Sedai. I don&rsquo;t know why they were gathered.
I&rsquo;ve never heard of this Bowl of the Winds, but there is a
storeroom such as you describe over&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Belowstairs, a woman channeled briefly. Someone
screamed in purest terror.</p>

<p>Elayne was on her feet in a flash, as were they all.
From somewhere in that feathered dress, Birgitte produced a
dagger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That must have been Derys,&rdquo; Reanne said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
the only other one here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne darted forward and caught her arm as she
started for the door. &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t Green yet,&rdquo; she murmured,
and was rewarded with a lovely dimpled smile, surprised and pleased
and diffident all at once. &ldquo;We will handle this, Reanne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Merilille and the others arrayed themselves to either
side, ready to follow Elayne out, but Birgitte was at the door
before any of them, grinning as she put hand to latch. Elayne
swallowed and said nothing. That was the Warder&rsquo;s honor, so
the Gaidin said; first to go in, last to come out. But she still
filled herself with <em>saidar</em>, ready to crush anything that
threatened her Warder.</p>

<p>The door opened before Birgitte could lift the
latch.</p>

<p>Mat sauntered in, pushing the slender maid Elayne
remembered ahead of him. &ldquo;I thought you might be here.&rdquo; He grinned
insolently, ignoring Derys&rsquo; glares, and went on, &ldquo;When I found
a bloody great lot of Warders drinking at my least favorite tavern.
I&rsquo;ve just come back from following a woman to the Rahad. To
the top floor of a house with nobody living on it, to be precise.
After she left, the floor was so dusty, I could see right away
which room she&rsquo;d gone to. There&rsquo;s a flaming big rusted
lock on the door, but I&rsquo;ll bet a thousand crowns to a kick in
the bottom, your Bowl is behind it.&rdquo; Derys aimed a kick at him, and
he pushed her away, pulling a small knife from his belt to bounce
on his palm. &ldquo;Will one of you tell this wildcat watchdog whose side
I&rsquo;m on? Women with knives make me uneasy, these days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We already know all about that, Mat,&rdquo; Elayne said.
Well, they had been just about to learn all about it, and the
stunned look on his face was <em>priceless</em>. She felt something
from Birgitte. The other woman gazed at her without any particular
expression, but that little knot of emotion in the back of
Elayne&rsquo;s head radiated disapproval. Aviendha probably would
not think much of it, either. Opening her mouth was one of the most
difficult things Elayne had ever done. &ldquo;I must thank you, though,
Mat. It is entirely due to you that we have found what we were
looking for.&rdquo; His gaping astonishment was almost worth the
agony.</p>

<p>He closed his mouth quickly, though opening it again
to say, &ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s hire a boat and fetch this bloody Bowl.
With any luck, we can leave Ebou Dar tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is ridiculous, Mat. And don&rsquo;t tell me
I&rsquo;m demeaning you. We are not crawling about the Rahad in the
dark, and we are not leaving Ebou Dar until we have used the
Bowl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He tried to argue, of course, but Derys took the
opportunity of his attention being elsewhere to try kicking him
again. He dodged around Birgitte, yelping for somebody to help him,
while the slender woman darted after him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is your Warder, Elayne Sedai?&rdquo; Reanne asked
doubtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light, no! Birgitte is.&rdquo; Reanne&rsquo;s mouth fell
open. Having answered a question, Elayne asked one, a question she
could not have brought herself to ask another sister. &ldquo;Reanne, if
you don&rsquo;t mind telling me, how old are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman hesitated, glancing at Mat, but he was
still dodging to keep a grinning Birgitte between him and Derys. &ldquo;My next naming day,&rdquo; Reanne said as if it was the most ordinary
thing in the world, &ldquo;will be my four hundred and twelfth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Merilille fainted dead away.</p>
