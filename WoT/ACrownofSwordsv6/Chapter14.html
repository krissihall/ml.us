Silver Circuit was misnamed at first glance, but
Ebou Dar liked grand names, and sometimes it seemed that the worse
they fit, the better. The grimiest tavern Mat had seen in the city,
smelling of very old fish, bore the name of The Queen&rsquo;s Glory
in Radiance, while The Golden Crown of Heaven graced a dim hole
across the river in the Rahad with only a blue door to mark it,
where black stains from old knife fights splotched the grimy floor.
The Silver Circuit was for racing horses.</p>

<p>Removing his hat, he fanned himself with the broad
brim, and went so far as to loosen the black silk scarf he wore to
hide the scar around his neck. The morning air shimmered with heat
already, yet crowds packed the two long earthen banks that flanked
the course where the horses would run up and back. That was all
there was to the Silver Circuit. The murmur of voices almost
drowned out the cries of the gulls overhead. There was no charge to
watch, so saltworkers in the white vest of their guild and
gaunt-faced farmers who had fled from the Dragonsworn inland rubbed
shoulders with ragged Taraboners wearing transparent veils across
their thick mustaches, weavers in vests with vertical stripes,
printers in horizontal stripes and dyers with hands stained to the
elbow. The unrelieved black of Amadician countrymen, buttoned to
the neck though the wearers seemed about to sweat to death, stood
alongside Murandian village dresses with long colorful aprons so
narrow they must be only for show, and even a handful of
copper-skinned Domani, the men in short coats if they wore one, the
women in wool or linen so thin it clung like silk. There were
apprentices, and laborers from the docks and warehouses, tanners
who had a small space around them in the crowd because of the smell
of their work, and filthy-faced street children watched closely
because they would steal whatever they could lay hand to. There was
little silver among the working people, though.</p>

<p>All of them were above the thick hemp ropes strung on
posts. Below was for those who did have silver, and gold; the
well-born, the well-dressed and the well-to-do. Smug menservants
poured punch into silver cups for their masters, fluttery maids
waved feathered fans to cool their mistresses, and there was even a
capering fool with white-painted face and jingling brass bells on
his black-and-white hat and coat. Haughty men in high-crowned
velvet hats strutted with slender swords on their hips, their hair
brushing silk coats slung across their shoulders and held by gold
or silver chains between the narrow, embroidered lapels. Some of
the women had hair shorter than the men and some longer, arranged
in as many ways as there were women; they wore wide hats with
plumes or sometimes fine netting to obscure their faces, and gowns
usually cut to show bosom whether in the local style or from
elsewhere. The nobles, beneath brightly colored parasols, glittered
with rings and earrings, necklaces and bracelets in gold and ivory
and fine gems as they stared down their noses at everyone else.
Well-fed merchants and moneylenders, with just a touch of lace and
perhaps one pin or a ring bearing a fat polished stone, humbly
bowed or curtsied to their betters, who very likely owed them vast
sums. Fortunes changed hands at the Silver Circuit, and not just in
wagers. It was said lives and honor changed hands, too, below the
ropes.</p>

<p>Replacing his hat, Mat raised his hand, and one of
the bookers came&mdash;a hatchet-faced woman, with a nose like an
awl&mdash;spreading bony hands as she bowed, murmuring the ritual &ldquo;As my Lord wishes to wager, so shall I write truly.&rdquo; The Ebou Dari
accent managed to be soft despite clipping the ends off some words. &ldquo;The book is open.&rdquo; Like the saying, the open book embroidered on
the breast of her red vest came from a time long past, when the
wagers were written into a book, but he suspected he was the only
one there who knew that. He remembered many things he had never
seen, from times long gone to dust.</p>

<p>With a quick glance at the odds for the
morning&rsquo;s fifth race, chalked on the slate the poleman held
up behind the red-vested woman, he nodded. Wind was only the third
favorite, despite his victories. He turned to his companion. &ldquo;Put
it all on Wind, Nalesean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Tairen hesitated, fingering the point of his
oiled black beard. Sweat glistened on his face, yet he kept his
coat with its fat, blue-striped sleeves fastened to the top and
wore a square cap of blue velvet that did nothing to keep the sun
off. &ldquo;All of it, Mat?&rdquo; He spoke softly, trying to keep the woman
from hearing. The odds could change any time until you actually
offered your wager. &ldquo;Burn my soul, but that little piebald looks
fast, and so does that pale dun gelding with the silvery mane.&rdquo;
They were the favorites today, new to the city and like all things
new, of great expectation.</p>

<p>Mat did not bother to glance toward the ten horses
entered in the next race that were parading at one end of the
course. He had already taken a good look while putting Olver up on
Wind. &ldquo;All of it. Some idiot clubbed the piebald&rsquo;s tail;
he&rsquo;s already half mad from the flies. The dun is showy, but he
has a bad angle to his fetlocks. He may have won some in the
country, but he&rsquo;ll finish last today.&rdquo; Horses were one thing
he knew on his own; his father had taught him, and Abell Cauthon
had a sharp eye for horseflesh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He looks more than showy to me,&rdquo; Nalesean grumbled,
but he was not arguing any more.</p>

<p>The booker blinked as Nalesean, sighing, pulled purse
after fat purse from his bulging coat pockets. At one point she
opened her mouth to protest, but the Illustrious and Honored Guild
of Bookers always claimed it would take any wager in any amount.
They even wagered with shipowners and merchants as to whether a
ship would sink or prices change; rather, the guild itself did, not
individual bookers. The gold went into one of her iron-strapped
chests, each carried by a pair of fellows with arms as thick as
Mat&rsquo;s legs. Her guards, hard-eyed and bent-nosed in leather
vests that showed arms still thicker, held long brass-bound
cudgels. Another of her men handed her a white token bearing a
detailed blue fish&mdash;every booker had a different sigil&mdash;and she wrote the wager, the name of the horse and a symbol
indicating the race on the back with a fine brush that she took
from a lacquered box held by a pretty girl. Slim, with big dark
eyes, the girl directed a slow smile at Mat. The hatchet-faced
woman certainly did not smile. Bowing again, she slapped the girl
casually and walked off whispering to her pole-man, who hastily
wiped his slate with a cloth. When he held it up again, Wind was
listed at the shortest odds. Rubbing her cheek surreptitiously, the
girl scowled back at Mat as though the slap had been his fault.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope your luck is in,&rdquo; Nalesean said, holding the
token carefully for the ink to dry. Bookers could be touchy about
paying on a token with smeared ink, and no one was touchier than
an Ebou Dari. &ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t lose often, but I&rsquo;ve seen
it happen, burn me but I have. There&rsquo;s a lass I mean to step
out with at the dancing tonight. Just a seamstress&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He was a
lord, though not a bad fellow really, and such things seemed
important to him. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but pretty enough to dry your mouth. She
likes trinkets. Golden trinkets. She likes fireworks, too&mdash;I
hear some Illuminators are setting up for tonight; you&rsquo;ll be
interested in that&mdash;but it&rsquo;s trinkets make her smile.
She won&rsquo;t be friendly if I cannot afford to make her smile,
Mat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make her smile,&rdquo; Mat said absently. The
horses were still walking in a circle above the starting poles.
Olver sat proudly on Wind&rsquo;s back, broad mouth grinning to
split his more-than-plain face from jug-ear to jug-ear. In Ebou
Dari races, all the riders were boys; a few miles inland, they used
girls. Olver was the smallest here today, the lightest, not that
the leggy gray gelding needed the advantage. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make her
laugh till she can&rsquo;t stand up.&rdquo; Nalesean gave him a frown he
barely noticed. The man should know gold was one thing Mat never
had to worry about. He might not always win, but close enough. His
luck had nothing to do with whether Wind won anyway. Of that he was
sure.</p>

<p>Gold did not concern him, but Olver did. There was no
rule against the boys using their switches on each other instead of
their mounts. In every race so far, Wind had broken to the lead and
stayed there, but if Olver took any hurt, even just a bruise, Mat
would never hear the end. Not from Mistress Anan, his innkeeper,
not from Nynaeve or Elayne, not from Aviendha or Birgitte. The
onetime Maiden of the Spear and the peculiar woman Elayne had taken
as a Warder were the last he would have expected to gush with
maternal feelings, yet they had already tried to move the boy out
of The Wandering Woman behind his back and into the Tarasin Palace.
Anywhere with so many Aes Sedai was the last place for Olver, or
for anybody, but one bump and instead of telling Birgitte and
Aviendha they had no right to take the boy, Setalle Anan would
likely hustle him off there herself. Olver would probably cry
himself to sleep if he was not allowed to race anymore, but women
never understood these things. For about the thousandth time, Mat
cursed Nalesean for sneaking Olver and Wind to those first races.
Of course, they had to find something to fill all the idle hours on
their hands, but they could have found something else. Cutting
purses could have been no worse in the women&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the thief-catcher,&rdquo; Nalesean said,
stuffing the token into his coat. He did not quite sneer. &ldquo;Much
good he&rsquo;s done so far. We&rsquo;d have done better to bring
another fifty soldiers instead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Juilin strode though the crowd purposefully, a dark,
hard man using a slender bamboo staff as tall as himself for a
walking stick. With a flat-topped conical red Taraboner cap on his
head and a plain coat, tight to the waist then flaring to his boot
tops, well-worn and plainly not the coat of someone rich, he
normally would not have been allowed below the ropes, but he made
out to study the horses and ostentatiously bounced a fat coin on
his palm. Several of the bookers&rsquo; guards looked at him
suspiciously, but the gold crown let him pass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Mat said sourly, tugging his hat low, once
the thief-catcher reached him. &ldquo;No, let me tell you. They slipped
out of the palace again. No one saw them go, again. Nobody has any
bloody idea where they are, again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Juilin tucked the coin carefully into his coat
pocket. He would make no wager; he seemed to save every copper that
came into his hands. &ldquo;All four of them took a closed coach from the
palace to a landing on the river, where they hired a boat. Thom
hired another to follow and see where they&rsquo;re going. Nowhere
dark or unpleasant, I&rsquo;d say, by their clothes. But it is true,
nobles wear silk to crawl in the mud.&rdquo; He grinned at Nalesean, who
folded his arms and pretended to be engrossed in the horses. The
grin was a mere baring of teeth. They were both Tairen, but the gap
between noble and common stood wide in Tear, and neither man liked
the other&rsquo;s company.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Women!&rdquo; Several finely dressed specimens nearby
turned to eye Mat askance from beneath bright parasols. He frowned
right back, though two were pretty, and they set to laughing and
chattering among themselves as though he had done something
amusing. A woman would do a thing until you were sure she always
would, then do something else just to fuddle you. But he had
promised Rand to see Elayne safely to Caemlyn, and Nynaeve and
Egwene with her. And he had promised Egwene to see the other two
safe on this trip to Ebou Dar, not to mention Aviendha; that was
the price of getting Elayne to Caemlyn. Not that they had told him
why they needed to be here; oh, no. Not that they had spoken twenty
words to him since arriving in the bloody city!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see them safe,&rdquo; he muttered under his
breath, &ldquo;if I have to stuff them into barrels and haul them to
Caemlyn in a cart.&rdquo; He might be the only man in the world who could
say that about Aes Sedai without looking over his shoulder, maybe
even including Rand and those fellows he was gathering. He touched
the foxhead medallion hanging under his shirt to make sure it was
there, though he never took it off, even to bathe. It did have
flaws, but a man liked to be reminded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tarabon must be terrible now for a woman not used to
taking care of herself,&rdquo; Juilin murmured. He was watching three
veiled men in tattered coats and baggy once-white trousers scramble
up the bank ahead of a pair of bookmen&rsquo;s guards waving their
clubs. No rule said the poor could not come below the ropes, but
the bookers&rsquo; guards did. The two pretty women who had eyed Mat
appeared to be making a private wager on whether the Taraboners
would outrun the guards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve more than enough women right here without
sense to come in out of the rain,&rdquo; Mat told him. &ldquo;Go back to that
boat landing and wait for Thom. Tell him I need him as soon as
possible. I want to know what those fool bloody women are up
to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Juilin&rsquo;s look did not quite call <em>him</em> a
fool. They had, after all, been trying to find out exactly that for
over a month now, ever since coming here. With a last glance at the
fleeing men, he sauntered back the way he had come, once more
bouncing the coin in his hand.</p>

<p>Frowning, Mat peered across the racecourse. It was
barely fifty paces to the crowd on the other side, and faces leaped
out at him&mdash;a bent, white-haired old man with a hooked nose,
a sharp-faced woman under a hat that seemed mostly plumes, a tall
fellow who looked like a stork in green silk and gold braid, a
nicely plump, full-mouthed young woman who appeared about to come
out of her dress at the top. The longer the heat continued, the
fewer and thinner garments women in Ebou Dar wore, but for once he
hardly gave them any notice. Weeks had gone by since he so much as
glimpsed the women who concerned him now.</p>

<p>Birgitte certainly needed no one to hold her hand; a
Hunter for the Horn, anyone who troubled her would be in a deep
hole by his estimation. And Aviendha&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;All she needed was
someone to keep her from stabbing everybody who looked at her
crossways. As far as he was concerned, she could knife whoever she
wanted so long as it was not Elayne. For all the bloody
Daughter-Heir walked about with her nose in the air, she turned
moon-eyed around Rand, and for all Aviendha behaved as if she would
stab any man who glanced her way, she did the same. Rand usually
knew how to deal with women, but he had jumped into a bear pit
letting that pair come together. It was a short road to disaster,
and why ruin had not happened was beyond Mat.</p>

<p>For some reason his eyes drifted back to the
sharp-faced woman. She was pretty, if vulpine. About Nynaeve&rsquo;s
age, he estimated; it was hard to tell at the distance, but he
could judge women as well as he could horses. Of course, women
could fool you faster than any horse. Slim. Why did she make him
think of straw? What he could see of her hair beneath the plumed
hat was dark. No matter.</p>

<p>Birgitte and Aviendha could do without his
shepherding, and normally he would have said the same of Elayne and
Nynaeve, however wrongheaded, conceited and downright pushy they
could be. That they had been sneaking out all this time said
differently, though. Wrongheadedness was the key. They were the
sort who berated a man for meddling and chased him away, then
berated him again for not being there when he was needed. Not that
they would admit he was needed, even then, not them. Raise a hand
to help and you were interfering, do nothing and you were an
untrustworthy wastrel.</p>

<p>The fox-faced woman across the way popped into his
view again. Not straw; a stable. Which made no more sense. He had
had fine times in stables with many a young woman and some not so
young, but she wore modestly cut blue silk with a high neck right
under her chin trimmed in snowy lace, and more spilling over her
hands. A lady, and he avoided noblewomen like death. Playing
haughty like a harp, expecting a man always to be at their beck and
call. Not Mat Cauthon. Strangely, she was fanning herself with a
spray of white plumes. Where was her maid? A knife. Why should she
make him think of a knife? And&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;fire? Something burning,
anyway.</p>

<p>Shaking his head, he tried to focus on what was
important. Other men&rsquo;s memories, of battles and courts and
lands vanished centuries ago, filled holes in his own, places
where his own life suddenly went thin or was not there at all. He
could remember fleeing the Two Rivers with Moiraine and Lan quite
clearly for example, but almost nothing more until reaching
Caemlyn, and there were gaps before and after, as well. If whole
years of his own growing up lay beyond recall, why should he expect
to recollect every woman he had met? Maybe she reminded him of some
woman dead a thousand years or more; the Light knew that happened
often enough. Even Birgitte sometimes tickled his memory. Well,
there were four women here and now who had his brain tied in knots.
They were what was important.</p>

<p>Nynaeve and the others were avoiding him as if he had
fleas. Five times he had been to the palace, and the once they
would see him, it was to say they were too busy for him and send
him away like an errand boy. It all added up to one thing. They
thought he would interfere with whatever they were up to, and the
only reason he would do that was if they were putting themselves in
danger. They were not complete fools; idiots often, but not
complete fools. If they saw danger, there was danger. Some places
in this city, being a stranger or showing a coin could bring a
knife in your ribs, and not even channeling would stop it if they
did not see in time. And here he was, with Nalesean and a dozen
good men from the Band, not to mention Thom and Juilin, who
actually had rooms in the servants&rsquo; quarters of the palace,
all left to twiddle their thumbs. Those thick-skulled women were
going to get their throats cut yet. &ldquo;Not if I can help it,&rdquo; he
growled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Nalesean said. &ldquo;Look. They&rsquo;re lining up,
Mat. The Light burn my soul, I hope you&rsquo;re right. That piebald
doesn&rsquo;t look half-crazed to me; he looks eager.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The horses were prancing, taking their places between
tall poles stuck in the ground, with streamers tailing from the
tops of them in a warm breeze, blue and green and every color, some
striped. Five hundred paces down the track of hard-beaten red clay
an identical number of streamered poles made another row. Each
rider had to round the same-colored streamer as floated to his
right at the start and then return. A booker stood at either end of
the line of horses, just to the front, a round woman and a rounder
man, each with a white scarf held overhead. The bookers took turns
at this, and were not allowed to accept wagers on a race they
started.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn me,&rdquo; Nalesean muttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light, man, be easy. You&rsquo;ll tickle your
seamstress under the chin yet.&rdquo; A roar drowned the last word as the
scarves came down, and the horses surged forward, even the sound of
their hooves submerged in the noise of the crowd. In ten strides
Wind had the lead, Olver lying close on his neck, with the
silver-maned dun only a head back. The piebald trailed in the pack,
where the riders&rsquo; switches already rose and fell
frantically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you the dun was dangerous,&rdquo; Nalesean moaned. &ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t have wagered everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat did not bother to answer. He had another purse in
his pocket and loose coins besides. He called the purse his seed;
with that, with even a few of the coins in it, and a game of dice,
he could repair his fortunes whatever happened this morning.
Halfway down the course, Wind still held the lead, the dun clinging
close a full length ahead of the next horse. The piebald was
running fifth. After the turn would come the hazard; boys on
trailing animals were known to slash at those who rounded the
stakes ahead of them.</p>

<p>Following the horses, Mat&rsquo;s eyes swept across
the sharp-faced woman again&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and snapped back. The shouts and
screams of the crowd faded. The woman was shaking her fan at the
horses and jumping excitedly, but suddenly he saw her in pale green
and a rich gray cloak, her hair caught in a frothy net of lace,
skirts held up delicately as she picked her way across a stable not
far from Caemlyn.</p>

<p><em>Rand still lay there moaning in the straw, even
if the fever seemed gone; at least he was not shouting anymore at
people who were not there. Mat eyed the woman suspiciously as she
knelt beside Rand. Maybe she could help as she claimed, but Mat did
not trust as he once had. What was a fine lady like this doing in a
village stable? Caressing the ruby-tipped hilt of the dagger hidden
by his coat, he wondered why he had ever trusted. It never paid.
Never.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;weak as a day-old kitten,&rdquo; she was saying
as she reached beneath her cloak. &ldquo;I think&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>A knife appeared in her hand so suddenly,
streaking for Mat&rsquo;s throat, that he would have been dead if he
had not been ready. Dropping flat, he seized her wrist, just
pushing it away from him, the curved Shadar Logoth blade sweeping
out to lie against her slim white neck. The woman froze, trying to
look down at the sharp edge dimpling her skin. He wanted to slice.
Especially when he saw where her own dagger had stabbed into the
stable wall. Around the slim blade a black circle of char grew, and
a thin gray tendril of smoke rose from wood about to burst into
flame.</em></p>

<p>Shivering, Mat rubbed a hand across his eyes. Just
carrying that Shadar Logoth knife had nearly killed him, eating
those holes in his memories, but how could he forget a woman who
tried to kill him? A Darkfriend&mdash;she had admitted as much&mdash;who tried to kill him with a dagger that set a bucket of
water near boiling when they tossed it in after securing her in the
tackroom. A Darkfriend who had been hunting Rand and him. What
chance she was in Ebou Dar when he was, at the races on the same
day? <em>Ta&rsquo;veren</em> might be the answer&mdash;he liked
thinking of that about as much he did the Horn of bloody Valere&mdash;but the fact was, the Forsaken knew his name. That stable
had not been the last time Darkfriends tried putting an end to Mat
Cauthon.</p>

<p>He staggered as Nalesean suddenly began pounding his
back. &ldquo;Look at him, Mat! Light of heaven, look at him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The horses had rounded the far poles and were well on
their way back. Head stretched out, mane and tail flying behind,
Wind streaked down the course with Olver clinging to his back like
a part of the saddle. The boy rode as if he had been born there.
Four lengths behind, the piebald pounded furiously, rider working
his switch in a futile effort to close. Just like that they slashed
across the finish line, with the next nearest horse another three
lengths back. The white-maned dun came last. The moans and mutters
of losing bettors overwhelmed the shouts of winners. Losing tokens
made a shower of white onto the track, and dozens of the
bookers&rsquo; servants rushed out to clear them away before the
next race.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have to find that woman, Mat. I&rsquo;d not put it
past her to run off without paying out so much as she owes us.&rdquo;
From what Mat had heard, the bookers&rsquo; guild was more than
harsh the first time one of its members tried anything of the sort,
and deadly the second, but they were commoners, and that was enough
for Nalesean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s standing right over there in plain view.&rdquo;
Mat gestured without taking his eyes from the fox-faced
Darkfriend. Glaring at a token, she hurled it to the ground, and
even lifted her skirts to stamp on it. Plainly not a wager on Wind.
Still grimacing, she began threading her way through the crowd. Mat
stiffened. She was leaving. &ldquo;Gather our winnings, Nalesean, then
take Olver back to the inn. If he misses his reading lesson,
you&rsquo;ll kiss the Dark One&rsquo;s sister before Mistress Anan
lets him out for another race.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw a woman who tried to kill me,&rdquo; Mat said over
his shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give her a trinket next time,&rdquo; Nalesean shouted
after him.</p>

<p>Following the woman was no trouble, with that
white-plumed hat for a banner bobbing through the crowd on the
other side. The earthen banks gave way to a large open area where
brightly lacquered coaches and sedan chairs waited under the
watchful eyes of drivers and bearers. Mat&rsquo;s horse Pips was one
of scores being guarded by members of the Ancient and Worshipful
Guild of Stablemen. There was a guild for most things in Ebou Dar,
and woe to anyone who trespassed on their ground. He paused, but
she walked on by the conveyances that had brought those with
position or money. No maid, and now not even a chair. No one walked
in this heat who had money to ride. Had my Lady come on hard
times?</p>

<p>The Silver Circuit lay just south of the tall
white-plastered city wall, and she strolled up the hundred paces or
so of road to the broad pointed arch of the Moldine Gate and in.
Trying to appear casual, Mat followed. The gateway was ten spans of
dim tunnel, but her hat stood out among the folk passing through.
People who had to walk seldom wore plumes. She seemed to know where
she was going on the other side. The plumes wove through the crowds
ahead of him, unhurried but always moving forward.</p>

<p>Ebou Dar shone white in the morning sun. White
palaces with white columns and screened wrought-iron balconies
cheek-by-jowl with white-plastered weavers&rsquo; shops and
fishmongers and stables, great white houses with louvered shutters
hiding their arched windows beside white inns with painted signs
hanging in front and open markets under long roofs where live sheep
and chickens, calves and geese and ducks made a barnyard din
alongside their fellows already butchered and hanging. All white,
stone or plaster, except here and there bands of red or blue or
gold on turnip-shaped domes and pointed spires that had balconies
running around them. There were squares everywhere, always with a
statue larger than life on a pedestal or a splashing fountain that
only emphasized the heat, always packed with people. Refugees
filled the city, and merchants and traders of every sort. Never a
trouble but brought profit to somebody. What Saldaea had once sent
into Arad Doman now came downriver to Ebou Dar, and so did what
Amadicia had traded into Tarabon. Everyone scurried, for a coin or
a thousand, for a bite to eat today. The aroma that hung in the air
was equal parts perfume, dust and sweat. Somehow, it all smelled
desperate.</p>

<p>Barge-filled canals sliced through the city, crossed
by dozens of bridges, some so narrow that two people would have to
squeeze past one another, others large enough that shops actually
lined them, hanging out over the water. On one of those, he
suddenly realized that the white-plumed hat had stopped. People
flowed around him as he did, too. The shops here were really just
open wooden nooks, with heavy plank shutters that could be let down
to close them off at night. Raised overhead now, the shutters
displayed signs for the shops. The one above the plumed hat showed
a golden scale and hammer, sign of the goldsmiths&rsquo; guild,
though plainly not of a particularly prosperous member. Through a
momentary gap in the crowd, he saw her look back, and turned
hurriedly to the narrow stall to his right. On the wall at the back
hung finger rings, and boards displaying stones cut in all sorts of
designs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord wishes a new signet ring?&rdquo; the birdlike
fellow behind the counter asked, bowing and dry-washing his hands.
Skinny as a rail, he had no worry of anyone stealing his goods.
Cramped into a corner on a stool sat a one-eyed fellow who might
have had trouble standing upright inside the cubicle, with a long
cudgel studded with nail heads propped between his massive knees. &ldquo;I can cut any design, as my Lord can see, and I have try-rings for
the size, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see that one.&rdquo; Mat pointed at random; he
needed some reason to stand here until she went on. It might be a
good time to decide exactly what he was going to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fine example of the long style, my Lord, much in
favor now. Gold, but I work in silver, as well. Why, I think the
size is right. If my Lord would care to try it on? My Lord may wish
to examine the fine detail of the carving? Does my Lord prefer gold
or silver?&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a grunt that he hoped might be taken for answer
to some of that, Mat shoved the proffered ring onto the second
finger of his left hand and pretended to examine the dark oval of
carved stone. All he really saw was that it was as long as the
joint of his finger. Head down, he studied the woman from the
corner of his eye the best he could through gaps that opened in the
throng. She was holding a wide, flat gold necklace up to the
light.</p>

<p>There was a Civil Guard in Ebou Dar, but not a very
efficient one, seldom to be seen on the streets. If he denounced
her, it would be his word against hers, and even if he was
believed, a few coins might let her walk free even on that charge.
The Civil Guard was cheaper than a magistrate, but either could be
bought unless someone powerful was watching, and then if enough
gold lay in the offer.</p>

<p>A swirl in the crowd suddenly turned into a
Whitecloak, conical helmet and long mail shirt gleaming like
silver, snowy cloak with the flaring golden sun billowing as he
strode along confident that a path would clear for him. Which it
certainly did; few willingly put themselves in the way of the
Children of the Light. Yet for every eye that slid away from the
stone-faced man, another beamed on him approvingly. The sharp-faced
woman not only looked at him openly, she smiled. A charge laid
against her might or might not put her in prison, but it could be
the spark to ignite a city full of tales about Darkfriends in the
Tarasin Palace. Whitecloaks were good at whipping up mobs, and to
them, Aes Sedai <em>were</em> Darkfriends. As the Child of the
Light passed her, she laid down the necklace, apparently regretful,
and turned to go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does the style suit my Lord?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat gave a start. He had forgotten the skinny man and
the ring, too. &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t want&mdash;&rdquo; Frowning, he tugged
at the ring again. It would not budge!</p>

<p>&ldquo;No need to pull; you might crack the stone.&rdquo; Now
that he was no longer a potential customer, Mat was no longer my
Lord, either. Sniffing, the fellow kept a sharp eye on him lest he
try to run. &ldquo;I have some grease. Deryl, where&rsquo;s that
grease-pot?&rdquo; The guard blinked and scratched his head as if
wondering what a grease-pot was. The white-plumed hat was halfway
to the end of the bridge already.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it,&rdquo; Mat snapped. No time for
haggling. Hauling a fistful of coins from his coat pocket, he
slapped them down on the counter, mostly gold and a little silver. &ldquo;Enough?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ringmaker&rsquo;s eyes bulged. &ldquo;A little too
much,&rdquo; he quavered uncertainly. His hands hesitated above the
coins, then two fingers pushed a pair of silver pennies toward Mat. &ldquo;So much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give them to Deryl,&rdquo; Mat growled as the bloody ring
slipped from his finger. The skinny man was hurriedly raking up the
rest of the coins. Too late to try backing out of the purchase. Mat
wondered by just how much he had overpaid. Stuffing the ring into
his pocket, he hastened after the Darkfriend. The hat was nowhere
to be seen.</p>

<p>Twinned statues decorated the end of the bridge, pale
marble women over a span tall, each with one breast bared and a
hand raised to point toward something in the sky. In Ebou Dar, a
bare chest symbolized openness and honesty. Ignoring stares, he
climbed up beside one of the women, steadying himself with an arm
around her waist. A street ran along the canal, and two more split
off at angles ahead, all full of people and carts, sedan chairs and
wagons and coaches. Someone shouted in a rough voice about real
women being warmer, and a number in the crowd laughed. White plumes
appeared from behind a blue-lacquered coach on the left-hand
fork.</p>

<p>Leaping down, he pushed up the street after her,
ignoring the curses of those he bumped. It was an odd chase. In the
mass of people, with wagons and coaches constantly getting in his
way, he could not keep a clear sight of the hat from the street.
Scampering up the broad marble steps of a palace, he got another
glimpse, then scurried back down to shove ahead. The rim of a tall
fountain gave him yet another view, then an upended barrel against
a wall, and a crate that had just been unloaded from an oxcart.
Once he clung to the side of a wagon until the driver threatened
him with her whip. With all the climbing and looking, he did not
narrow the Darkfriend&rsquo;s lead very much. But then, he still had
no notion what to do if he caught her. Suddenly, when he hoisted
himself up onto the narrow coping along the face of one of the big
houses, she was not there anymore.</p>

<p>Frantically he looked up and down the street. The
white plumes no longer waved through the crowd. In easy sight were
half a dozen houses much like the one he was clinging to; several
palaces of various sizes, two inns, three taverns, a cutler&rsquo;s
shop with a knife and a pair of scissors on its sign, a fishmonger
with a board painted in fifty kinds of fish, two rugweavers with
unrolled carpets spread on tables beneath awnings, a tailor&rsquo;s
shop and four cloth sellers, two shops displaying lacquerware, a
goldsmith, a silversmith, a livery stable&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The list was too
long. She could have gone into any of them. Or none. She might have
taken a turn he had not seen.</p>

<p>Jumping down, he settled his hat, muttering under his
breath&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and saw her, almost at the top of the wide stairs
leading to a palace nearly across from him, already half-hidden by
the tall fluted columns out front. The palace was not large, with
only two slim spires and a single pear-shaped dome banded in red,
but Ebou Dari palaces always gave the ground floor to servants and
kitchens and the like. The better rooms were high, to catch the
breezes. Doormen liveried in black and yellow bowed deeply and
swung the carved doors wide before she reached them. A servant
inside curtsied, apparently saying something, and immediately
turned to lead her deeper. She was known. He would have wagered
everything on it</p>

<p>For a while after the doors closed, he stood there
studying the palace. Not the richest in the city by far, but only a
noble would dare build its like. &ldquo;But who in the Pit of Doom lives
there?&rdquo; he muttered finally, plucking off his hat to fan himself.
Not her, not when she had to walk. A few questions in the taverns
along the street would tell him. And word of his queries would seep
to the palace, sure as dirt soiled your hands.</p>

<p>Someone said, &ldquo;Carridin.&rdquo; It was a scrawny,
white-haired fellow lounging nearby in the shade. Mat looked at him
questioningly, and he grinned, showing gaps in his teeth. His
stooped shoulders and sad weathered face did not fit his fine gray
coat. Despite a bit of lace at his neck, he was the very picture of
hard times. &ldquo;You asked who lived there. The Chelsaine Palace is let
to Jaichim Carridin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat&rsquo;s hat paused. &ldquo;You mean the Whitecloak
ambassador?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye. And Inquisitor of the Hand of the Light.&rdquo; The
old man tapped a gnarled finger against the side of his beak of a
nose. Both looked to have been broken several times. &ldquo;Not a man to
bother unless you must, and then I&rsquo;d think three times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unconsciously Mat hummed a bit of &ldquo;Storm from the
Mountains.&rdquo; Not a man to bother indeed. Questioners were the
nastiest of the Whitecloaks. A Whitecloak Inquisitor who had a
Darkfriend come to call.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you&mdash;&rdquo; Mat gave a start. The fellow was
gone, swallowed up in the crowd. Strange, but he had looked
familiar. Maybe another long-dead acquaintance drifting out of
those old memories. Maybe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;It hit him like an
Illuminator&rsquo;s nightflower exploding inside his head. A
white-haired man with a hooked nose. That old man had been at the
Silver Circuit, standing not far from the woman who had just gone
into Carridin&rsquo;s rented palace. Turning his hat in his hands,
he frowned uneasily at the palace. The Mire never held a bog like
this one. He could feel the dice tumbling in his head suddenly, and
that was always a bad sign.</p>
