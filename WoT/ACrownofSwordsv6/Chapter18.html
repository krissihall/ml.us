<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">S</span>eizing
<em>saidin</em> long enough to unknot the
ward he had woven across one corner of the anteroom, Rand raised
his small silver-mounted cup and said, &ldquo;More tea.&rdquo; Lews Therin
muttered angrily in the back of his head.</p>

<p>Carved chairs heavy with gilt stood in paired lines
to either side of a golden Rising Sun, two paces wide, set into the
polished stone floor, and another tall chair so gilded it seemed
entirely gold topped a small dais that was just as elaborate, but
he sat cross-legged on a carpet spread for the occasion, green and
gold and blue in a Tairen maze. The three clan chiefs seated across
from him would have disliked him receiving them from a chair even
if they were offered their own. They were another maze, to be trod
warily. He was in his shirt, sleeves pushed up his forearms to
expose the red-and-gold Dragon that curled around each, glittering
metallically. The Aielmen&rsquo;s <em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em> covered
theirs, on the left arm alone. Perhaps the reminder of who he was&mdash;that he too had been to Rhuidean when the journey meant
death for most men who entered&mdash;perhaps it was unnecessary.
Perhaps.</p>

<p>Those three faces gave away little as they watched
Merana come from the corner where she had been sealed off.
Janwin&rsquo;s creased face could have been carved from old wood,
but it always looked that way, and if his blue-gray eyes seemed
stormy, so did they always too. Even his hair looked like storm
clouds. He was an even-tempered man, though. Indirian and one-eyed
Mandelain might have been thinking of something else, except that
their unblinking gazes followed her. Lews Therin suddenly went
silent, as if he too watched, through Rand&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>Merana&rsquo;s ageless features revealed even less
than the clan chiefs&rsquo;. Smoothing her pale gray skirts under,
she knelt beside Rand and lifted the teapot. A massive ball of
gold-washed silver, with leopards for feet and handle and another
crouched on the lid, it required both of her hands and wavered a
little as she carefully filled Rand&rsquo;s cup. Her manner seemed
to say she did this because she wanted to, for reasons of her own
that none of them could begin to understand; her manner shouted Aes
Sedai louder than her face did. Was that to the good, or the
bad?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not allow them to channel without permission,&rdquo;
he said. The clan chiefs kept silent. Merana rose and moved to
kneel beside each in turn. Mandelain covered his cup with a broad
hand to indicate he wanted no more. The other two held out theirs,
blue-gray eyes and green alike studying her. What did they see?
What more could he do?</p>

<p>Replacing the heavy teapot on the thick
leopard-handled tray, she remained on her knees. &ldquo;May I serve my
Lord Dragon in any way else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her voice was self-possession itself, but after he
motioned her back to her corner, after she had risen and turned,
slim hands clutched at her skirts for an instant. Yet that might
have been because turning brought her to face Dashiva and Narishma.
The two Asha&rsquo;man&mdash;to be precise, Narishma was still only
a soldier, the lowest level of Asha&rsquo;man, with neither the
sword nor the Dragon on his collar&mdash;the Asha&rsquo;man stood
impassively between two of the tall golden-framed mirrors that
lined the walls. At least, the younger man looked impassive, at
first glance. Thumbs tucked behind his sword belt, he ignored
Merana and paid little more attention to Rand or the Aielmen, yet
at a second glance you saw that his dark too-big eyes never rested,
as if he expected the unexpected to leap out of the air any moment.
And who could say it would not? Dashiva appeared to have his head
in the clouds; his lips moved soundlessly, and he blinked and
frowned at nothing.</p>

<p>Lews Therin snarled when Rand looked at the
Asha&rsquo;man, but it was Merana who occupied the dead man inside
Rand&rsquo;s head. <em>Only a fool thinks a lion or a woman can
truly be tamed</em>.</p>

<p>Irritably, Rand suppressed the voice to a muted buzz.
Lews Therin could break through, but not without effort. Grabbing
hold of <em>saidin</em>, he rewove the ward that shut Merana away
from their voices. Releasing the Source again increased his
irritation, the hissing in his head, the water drops on red coals.
An echo pulsing in time with Lews Therin&rsquo;s mad, distant
rage.</p>

<p>Merana stood behind the barrier she could neither see
nor feel, head high and hands folded at her waist as if a shawl
were looped over her arms. Aes Sedai to her toenails. She watched
him and the clan chiefs with cool eyes, light brown flecked with
yellow. <em>My sisters do not all realize how very much we need
you</em>, she had told him this morning in this very room, <em>but
all of us who swore will do whatever you ask that would not violate
the Three Oaths</em>. He had just wakened when she came with
Sorilea escorting her. Neither seemed to care at all that he was
still in a robe, with only one bite taken from his breakfast bread.
<em>I have more than a little skill in negotiation and mediation.
My sisters have other skills. Let us serve you, as we pledged. Let
me serve you. We need you, but you have some need of us,
too</em>.</p>

<p>Ever present, Alanna lay nestled in a corner of his
brain. She was weeping again. He could not understand why she wept
so often. He had forbidden her to come near him unless summoned, or
leave her room without an escort of Maidens&mdash;the sisters who
had sworn to him had been found rooms last night, in the Palace
where he could keep an eye on them&mdash;but he had sensed tears
from the moment she bonded him, tears and a raw grief like being
ripped by claws. Sometimes it was less, sometimes more, yet always
there. Alanna also had told him he needed the sworn sisters,
screamed it at him finally, with her face red and tears rolling
down her cheeks, before literally running from his presence. And
she had spoken of serving, too, though he doubted that
Merana&rsquo;s present tasks were what either had in mind. Perhaps
some sort of livery would make it clear?</p>

<p>The clan chiefs watched Merana watch them. Not so
much as the flicker of an eyelash betrayed their thoughts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Wise Ones have told you where the Aes Sedai
stand,&rdquo; Rand said bluntly. Sorilea had told him they knew, but the
fact would have been clear from the lack of surprise when they
first saw Merana fetch and curtsy. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen her bring the
tray and pour your tea. You&rsquo;ve seen her come and go as I say.
If you want, I&rsquo;ll have her dance a jig.&rdquo; Convincing the Aiel
that he was not on the end of an Aes Sedai leash was the most
needed service any of the sisters could do him right now. He would
have them all doing jigs, if necessary.</p>

<p>Mandelain adjusted the gray-green patch over his
right eye, the way he did when he wanted a moment to think. A thick
puckered scar ran up his forehead from behind the leather patch and
halfway across his mostly bald head. When he finally spoke, it was
only a little less blunt than Rand. &ldquo;Some say an Aes Sedai will do
anything to have what she wants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indirian lowered heavy white eyebrows and peered down
his long nose at his tea. Of only average height for an Aielman, he
was shorter than Rand by half a hand, yet everything about him
seemed long. The heat of the Waste appeared to have melted away
every spare ounce of flesh and a few more besides. His cheekbones
stood out sharp, and his eyes were emeralds set in caves. &ldquo;I do not
like speaking of Aes Sedai.&rdquo; His deep, rich voice was always a
shock, coming from that gaunt face. &ldquo;What is done, is done. Let the
Wise Ones deal with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better to speak of the Shaido dogs,&rdquo; Janwin said
mildly. Which was almost as great a shock, coming from his fierce
face. &ldquo;Within a few months, less than half a year at most, every
Shaido who can be will be dead&mdash;or made <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>.&rdquo; Just because his voice was soft did not mean
he was. The other two nodded; Mandelain smiled eagerly.</p>

<p>They still seemed unconvinced. The Shaido had been
the professed reason for this meeting, and no less important for
not being the most important. Not unimportant&mdash;the Shaido had
made trouble long enough&mdash;just not on the same page with the
Aes Sedai in his book. They did present problems, though. Three
clans joining Timolan&rsquo;s Miagoma, already near Kinslayer&rsquo;s
Dagger, might well be able to do as Janwin said, but there were
those who could not be made <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> and could not
be killed. Some were more critical than others. &ldquo;What of the Wise
Ones?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>For a moment their faces became unreadable; not even
Aes Sedai could do that so well as Aiel. Facing the One Power did
not frighten them, not where it showed, at least; no one could
outrun death, so Aiel believed, and a hundred Aes Sedai in a rage
could not make a lone Aiel lower the veil once raised. But learning
that Wise Ones had taken part in the fighting at Dumai&rsquo;s Wells
had hit them like watching the sun rise by night and the moon by
day in a blood-red sky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sarinde tells me almost all of the Wise Ones will
run with the <em>algai&rsquo;d&rsquo;siswai</em>,&rdquo; Indirian said at
last, reluctantly. Sarinde was the Wise One who had followed him
from Red Springs, clan hold of the Codarra. Or perhaps &ldquo;followed&rdquo;
was not the right word; Wise Ones seldom did. In any case, most of
the Codarra Wise Ones, and the Shiande and the Daryne, would go
north with the spears. &ldquo;The Shaido Wise Ones will be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;dealt
with&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;by Wise Ones.&rdquo; His mouth twisted with disgust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All things change.&rdquo; Janwin&rsquo;s voice was even
softer than usual. He believed, but he did not want to. Wise Ones
taking part in battle violated custom as old as the Aiel.</p>

<p>Mandelain set his cup down with exaggerated care. &ldquo;Corehuin wishes to see Jair again before the dream ends, and so do
I.&rdquo; Like Bael and Rhuarc, he had two wives; the other chiefs had
only one each, except Timolan, but a widowed chief seldom remained
so long. The Wise Ones saw to that if he did not. &ldquo;Will any of us
ever see the sun rise again in the Three-fold Land?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; Rand said slowly. <em>As the plow breaks
the earth shall he break the lives of men, and all that was shall
be consumed in the fire of his eyes. The trumpets of war shall
sound at his footsteps, the ravens feed at his voice, and he shall
wear a crown of swords</em>. The Prophecies of the Dragon gave
little hope for anything except victory over the Dark One, and only
a chance of that. The Prophecy of Rhuidean, the Aiel Prophecy, said
he would destroy them. The bleakness swept through the clans
because of him and ancient customs were ripped apart. Even without
the Aes Sedai, small wonder if some chiefs pondered whether they
were right to follow Rand al&rsquo;Thor, Dragons on his arms or no. &ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May you always find water and shade, Rand
al&rsquo;Thor,&rdquo; Indirian said.</p>

<p>After they left, Rand sat frowning into his cup,
finding no answers in the dark tea. Finally he set it beside the
tray and pushed his sleeves down. Merana&rsquo;s eyes were intent on
him, as if trying to pull out his thoughts. There was a hint of
impatience about her, too. He had told her to stay in the corner
unless she could hear voices. Doubtless she saw no reason why she
should not come out now the clan chiefs were gone. Come out, and
dig out what had been said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think they believe I dance on Aes Sedai
strings?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Young Narishma gave a start. In truth, he was a
little older than Rand, but he had the look of a boy five or six
years younger. He glanced at Merana as though she had the answer,
and shifted his shoulders uncomfortably. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;do not know, my
Lord Dragon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dashiva blinked and stopped murmuring to himself.
Tilting his head, bird-like, he eyed Rand sideways. &ldquo;Does it
matter, so long as they obey?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It matters,&rdquo; Rand said. Dashiva shrugged, and
Narishma frowned thoughtfully; neither seemed to understand, yet
maybe Narishma could come to.</p>

<p>Maps littered the stone floor behind the throne on
its dais, rolled or folded or spread out where he had left them. He
shifted some with the toe of his boot. So much to be juggled at
once. Northern Cairhien and the mountains called Kinslayer&rsquo;s
Dagger, and the region around the city. Illian and the Plains of
Maredo out to Far Madding. The island of Tar Valon and all the
surrounding towns and villages. Ghealdan and part of Amadicia.
Movement and color in his head. Lews Therin moaned and laughed in
the distance, faint mad mutters of killing the Asha&rsquo;man,
killing the Forsaken. Killing himself. Alanna stopped weeping,
cutting anguish subdued beneath a thin thread of anger. Rand
scrubbed his hands through his hair, pressing hard against his
temples. What had it been like to be alone inside his own skull? He
could not recall.</p>

<p>One of the tall doors opened to admit one of the
Maidens who were standing guard in the corridor. Riallin, with
vivid yellow-red hair and a grin for everything, actually managed
to appear plump. For a Maiden, anyway. &ldquo;Berelain sur Paendrag and
Annoura Larisen wish to see the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>.&rdquo; she
announced. Her voice went from warm and friendly on the first name
to cold and flat on the second without disturbing her grin.</p>

<p>Rand sighed and opened his mouth to let them enter,
but Berelain did not wait. She stormed in, a somewhat calmer
Annoura at her heels. The Aes Sedai shied slightly at the sight of
Dashiva and Narishma, and stared curiously when she saw Merana
standing in her corner. Not so Berelain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this, my Lord Dragon?&rdquo; she
demanded, brandishing the letter he had had delivered to her this
morning. She stalked across the floor to shake it under his nose. &ldquo;Why am I to return to Mayene? I have governed well here in your
name, and you know it. I could not stop Colavaere having herself
crowned, but at least I stopped her changing the laws you made. Why
am I to be sent away? And why am I told by letter? Not to my face.
By letter! Thanked for my services and dismissed like a clerk
who&rsquo;s done collecting the taxes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even furious, the First of Mayene was one of the most
beautiful women Rand had ever seen. Black hair fell in shining
waves to her shoulders, framing a face to make a blind man stare. A
man could easily drown in her dark eyes. Today she wore shimmering
silver silk, thin and clinging and more suited to entertaining a
lover in private. In fact, had the neckline been a hair lower, she
would not have been able to wear the dress in public. As it was, he
was not sure she should. He had told himself when writing that
letter that it was because he had too much to do and no time for
arguing with her. The truth was, he enjoyed looking at her too
much; for some reason, he had begun feeling that that was&mdash;not exactly wrong, but almost.</p>

<p>As soon as she appeared, Lews Therin gave over
ranting to hum softly, the way he did when admiring a woman.
Abruptly Rand realized he was thumbing his earlobe, and felt a
shock. Instinctively, he knew that was something else Lews Therin
did without thinking, like the humming. He pushed his hand to his
side, but for an instant it wanted to rise to his ear again.</p>

<p><em>Burn you, this is my body!</em> The thought was a
snarl. <em>Mine!</em> Lews Therin&rsquo;s hum stopped in surprise, and
confusion; without a sound, the dead man fled, back into the
deepest shadows of Rand&rsquo;s brain.</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s silence had an effect. Berelain lowered
the letter, and her anger receded. A little. Eyes fixed on his, she
drew a deep breath that heated his cheeks. &ldquo;My Lord Dragon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know why,&rdquo; he cut in. Looking only at her eyes
was not easy. Oddly, he found himself wishing Min were there. Very
odd. Her viewings would be no help now. &ldquo;When you returned from
that Sea Folk ship this morning, there was a fellow waiting on the
dock with a knife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Berelain tossed her head contemptuously. &ldquo;He came no
closer than three steps. I was accompanied by a dozen of the Winged
Guards and Lord Captain Gallenne.&rdquo; Nurelle had led some of the
Winged Guards to Dumai&rsquo;s Wells, but Gallenne commanded the
Guards as a whole. She had eight hundred of them in the city aside
from those who returned with Nurelle. &ldquo;You expect me to turn tail
because of a cutpurse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play the fool,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;A cutpurse,
with a dozen soldiers around you?&rdquo; Color flared in her cheeks; she
knew, all right. He gave her no chance for protests or explanations
or any other foolishness. &ldquo;Dobraine tells me he&rsquo;s already
heard whispers in the palace that you betrayed Colavaere. Those who
supported her might be afraid to say boo to me, but they&rsquo;ll
pay to have a knife stuck into you.&rdquo; And Faile, too, according to
Dobraine; that was being taken care of. &ldquo;But they won&rsquo;t have a
chance, because you are going back to Mayene. Dobraine will take
your place here until Elayne claims the Sun Throne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She spluttered as if he had dumped cold water down
her dress. Her eyes grew dangerously large. He had been glad when
she stopped being afraid of him, but now he was not so sure. As she
opened her mouth to explode, Annoura touched her arm, and her head
whipped around. They exchanged a long look, and Berelain&rsquo;s
sputters subsided. She smoothed her skirts and vigorously squared
her shoulders. Rand looked away hastily.</p>

<p>Merana hovered at the edge of the ward. He wondered
whether she had stepped across and dodged back&mdash;how else
could she stand right on top of what she could not possibly detect?
When his head turned, she moved backward until she almost touched
the walls, her eyes never leaving him. By her face, she would have
poured his tea every day for ten years to hear what was being
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord Dragon,&rdquo; Berelain said, smiling, &ldquo;there is
still the matter of the Atha&rsquo;an Miere.&rdquo; Her voice was warm
honey; the curve of her lips would have sparked thoughts of kisses
in a stone. &ldquo;The Wavemistress Harine is not pleased to be left
sitting on her ship so long. I have visited with her a number of
times. I can smooth the difficulties there, which I hardly think
Lord Dobraine can. I believe the Sea Folk are vital to you whether
or not the Prophecies of the Dragon mention them. You are crucial
in their prophecies, though they seem reluctant to say exactly
how.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stared. Why was she struggling so hard to keep a
difficult job that had offered few thanks from Cairhienin even
before some began wanting to kill her? She was a ruler, used to
dealing with rulers and embassies, not street thugs and knives in
the dark. Warm honey or no warm honey, it was not for any desire to
stay near Rand al&rsquo;Thor. She had&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well, offered herself to
him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;once, but the hard fact was that Mayene was a small
country, and Berelain used her beauty as a man would a sword, to
keep her land from being swallowed by its more powerful neighbor,
Tear. And there, simple as that, he had it. &ldquo;Berelain, I don&rsquo;t
know what else I can do to guarantee Mayene for you, but I will
write out any&mdash;&rdquo; Colors swirled so strongly in his head that
his tongue froze. Lews Therin cackled. <em>A woman who knows the
danger and isn&rsquo;t afraid is a treasure only a madman would
spurn</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guarantees.&rdquo; Bleakness engulfed honey, and anger
bubbled again, cold this time. Annoura plucked at Berelain&rsquo;s
sleeve, but she paid the Aes Sedai no heed. &ldquo;While I sit in Mayene
with your guarantees, others will serve you. They will ask then
rewards, and the service I did here will be faded and old, while
theirs is bright and new. If the High Lord Weiramon gives you
Illian and asks Mayene in return, what will you say? If he gives
you Murandy, and Altara, and everything clear to the Aryth
Ocean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you serve if it still means leaving?&rdquo; he asked
quietly. &ldquo;You will be out of my sight, but not out of my mind.&rdquo;
Lews Therin laughed again, in such a way that Rand nearly blushed.
He enjoyed looking, but sometimes the things Lews Therin thought&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Berelain considered him with stubborn eyes, and he
could all but see the questions being toted up behind
Annoura&rsquo;s, the careful choosing of which to ask.</p>

<p>The door opened again for Riallin. &ldquo;An Aes Sedai has
come to see the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>.&rdquo; She managed to
sound cold and uncertain at the same time. &ldquo;Her name is Cadsuane
Melaidhrin.&rdquo; A strikingly handsome woman swept in right behind her,
iron-gray hair gathered in a bun atop her head and decorated with
dangling gold ornaments, and it seemed everything happened at
once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you were dead,&rdquo; Annoura gasped, eyes
nearly starting out of her head.</p>

<p>Merana darted through the ward, hands outstretched. &ldquo;No, Cadsuane!&rdquo; she screamed. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t harm him! You must
not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s skin tingled as someone in the room
embraced <em>saidar</em>, perhaps more than one, and swiftly moving
well clear of Berelain, he seized hold of the Source, flooding
himself with <em>saidin</em>, feeling it fill the Asha&rsquo;man.
Dashiva&rsquo;s face twitched as he glared from one Aes Sedai to
another. Despite the Power he held, Narishma grasped his sword hilt
with both hands and assumed the stance called Leopard in the Tree,
on the brink of drawing. Lews Therin snarled of killing and death,
kill them all, kill them now. Riallin raised her veil, shouting
something, and suddenly a dozen Maidens were in the room, veiling,
spears ready. It was hardly surprising that Berelain stood gaping
as if everyone had gone mad.</p>

<p>For someone who had caused all that, this Cadsuane
seemed remarkably unaffected. She looked at the Maidens and shook
her head, golden stars and moons and birds swaying gently. &ldquo;Trying
to grow decent roses in northern Ghealdan may be near to death,
Annoura,&rdquo; she said dryly, &ldquo;but it is not quite the grave. Oh, do
calm down, Merana, before you frighten someone. One would think you
would have grown a little less excitable since putting off novice
white.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Merana opened and closed her mouth, looking abashed
of all things, and the tingling vanished abruptly. Rand did not
release <em>saidin</em>, though, nor did the Asha&rsquo;man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;What Ajah?&rdquo; Red, by
Merana&rsquo;s reaction, but for a Red sister simply to walk in like
this, alone, would require suicidal courage. &ldquo;What do you
want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cadsuane&rsquo;s gaze lingered on him for no more than
a moment, and she did not answer. Merana&rsquo;s lips parted, but
the gray-haired woman looked at her, raising one eyebrow, and that
was that. Merana actually reddened and lowered her eyes. Annoura
was still staring at the newcomer as if at a ghost. Or a giant.</p>

<p>Without a word, Cadsuane swept across the room to the
two Asha&rsquo;man, dark green divided skirts swishing. Rand was
beginning to get the feeling that she always moved in that rushing
glide, graceful yet wasting no time and allowing nothing to impede
her. Dashiva stared her up and down, and sneered. Although looking
him straight in the face, she did not seem to notice, any more than
she appeared to notice Narishma&rsquo;s hands on his sword when she
put a finger under his chin, moving his head from side to side
before he could jerk back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What lovely eyes,&rdquo; she murmured. Narishma blinked
uncertainly, and Dashiva&rsquo;s sneer turned to a grin, but a nasty
one that made his former smirk lighthearted in comparison.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do nothing,&rdquo; Rand snapped. Dashiva had the gall to
glower at him before sullenly pressing a fist to his chest in the
salute the Asha&rsquo;man used. &ldquo;What do you want here, Cadsuane,&rdquo;
Rand went on. &ldquo;Look at me, burn you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did, turning just her head. &ldquo;So you are Rand
al&rsquo;Thor, the Dragon Reborn. I&rsquo;d have thought even a child
like Moiraine could have taught you a few manners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Riallin put the spear from her right hand with those
clutched behind her buckler and flashed Maiden handtalk. For once,
none laughed. For once, Rand was sure the talk was not a joke about
him. &ldquo;Be easy, Riallin,&rdquo; he said, raising a hand. &ldquo;All of you, be
easy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cadsuane ignored the byplay too, directing a smile to
Berelain. &ldquo;So this is your Berelain, Annoura. She is more beautiful
than I had heard.&rdquo; The curtsy she made, bowing her head, was quite
deep, yet somehow without any suggestion of obeisance, no hint that
she was in any way less. It truly was a courtesy, no more. &ldquo;My Lady
First of Mayene, I must speak with this young man, and I would
retain your advisor. I&rsquo;ve heard you have undertaken many
duties here. I would not keep you from them.&rdquo; It was as clear a
dismissal as could be, short of holding the door open.</p>

<p>Berelain inclined her head graciously, then smoothly
turned to Rand and spread her skirts in a curtsy so deep that he
worried whether she would remain even as clothed as she was. &ldquo;My
Lord Dragon,&rdquo; she intoned, &ldquo;I ask your kind permission to
withdraw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s return bow was not so practiced. &ldquo;Granted, my Lady First, as you wish.&rdquo; He offered her a hand, to
help her rise. &ldquo;I hope you will consider my proposal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord Dragon, I will serve you wherever and
however you desire.&rdquo; Her voice was all honey again. For
Cadsuane&rsquo;s benefit, he supposed. There was certainly no
flirtation on her face, only determination. &ldquo;Remember Harine,&rdquo; she
added in a whisper.</p>

<p>When the door closed behind Berelain, Cadsuane said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always good to see children play, don&rsquo;t you think,
Merana?&rdquo; Merana goggled, head swiveling between Rand and the
gray-haired sister. Annoura looked as though only willpower held
her upright.</p>

<p>Most of the Maidens followed Berelain, apparently
deciding there was to be no killing, but Riallin and two others
remained before the door, still veiled. It might have been
coincidence that there was one for each Aes Sedai. Dashiva also
seemed to think any danger past. He leaned back against the wall
with a foot propped, lips moving silently, arms folded, apparently
watching the Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>Narishma frowned questioningly at Rand, but Rand only
shook his head. The woman was deliberately trying to provoke him.
The question was, why provoke a man she must know could still her,
or kill her, without exerting himself? Lews Therin muttered the
same thing. <em>Why? Why?</em> Stepping onto the dais, Rand took up the
Dragon Scepter from the throne and sat, waiting to see what would
happen. The woman was not going to succeed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather ornate, wouldn&rsquo;t you say?&rdquo; Cadsuane said
to Annoura, looking around. Aside from all the other gold, broad
bands of it ran around the walls above the mirrors, and the
cornices were nearly two feet of golden scales. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never
known whether Cairhienin or Tairens overdo worse, but either can
make an Ebou Dari blush, or even a Tinker. Is that a tea tray? I
would like some, if it&rsquo;s fresh, and hot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Channeling, Rand scooped up the tray, half expecting
to see the metal corrode from the taint, and wafted it to the three
women. Merana had brought extra cups, and four still stood unused
on the tray. He filled three, replaced the teapot and waited. It
floated in midair, supported by <em>saidin</em>.</p>

<p>Three very different women in appearance, and three
distinctly different reactions. Annoura looked at the tray much as
one might a coiled viper, gave a tiny shake of her head, and took a
small step back. Merana drew a deep breath and slowly picked up a
cup with a hand that trembled slightly. Knowing a man could channel
and being forced to see it were not at all the same. Cadsuane,
though, took her cup and sniffed the vapors with a pleased smile.
Nothing could tell her which of the three men had poured the tea,
yet she looked across her cup straight at Rand, lounging with one
leg over the arm over his chair. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good boy,&rdquo; she
said. The Maidens passed shocked looks above their veils.</p>

<p>Rand quivered. No. She would not provoke him. For
whatever reason, that was what she wanted, and she would not! &ldquo;I
will ask one more time,&rdquo; he said. Strange, that his voice could be
that cold; inside, he was hotter than the hottest fires of <em>saidin</em>. &ldquo;What do you want? Answer, or leave. By the door or a
window; your choice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Merana began to speak, and again Cadsuane
silenced her, this time by a sharp gesture without looking away
from him. &ldquo;To see you,&rdquo; she said calmly. &ldquo;I am Green Ajah, not Red,
but I have worn the shawl longer than any other sister living, and
I have faced more men who could channel than any four Reds, maybe
than any ten. Not that I hunted them, you understand, but I seem to
have a nose.&rdquo; Calmly, a woman saying she had been to market once or
twice in her life. &ldquo;Some fought to the bitter end, kicking and
screaming even after they were shielded and bound. Some wept and
begged, offering gold, anything, their very souls, not to be taken
to Tar Valon. Still others wept from relief, meek as lambs,
thankful finally to be done with it. Light&rsquo;s truth, they all
weep, at the end. There is nothing left for them but tears at the
end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The heat inside him erupted in rage. Tray and massive
teapot hurtled across the room, smashing a mirror with a thunderous
crash and bouncing back in a shower of glass, half-flattened pot
spraying tea, tray spinning across the floor bent double. Everyone
jumped except Cadsuane. Rand leaped from the dais, clutching the
Dragon Scepter so hard his knuckles hurt. &ldquo;Is that supposed to
frighten me?&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;Do you expect me to beg, or to be
thankful? To weep? Aes Sedai, I could close my hand and crush you.&rdquo;
The hand he held up shook with fury. &ldquo;Merana knows why I should.
The Light only knows why I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman looked at the battered tea things as if she
had all the time in the world. &ldquo;Now you know,&rdquo; she said at last,
calm as ever, &ldquo;that I know your future, and your present. The
Light&rsquo;s mercy fades to nothing for a man who can channel. Some
see that and believe the Light denies those men. I do not. Have you
begun to hear voices, yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked slowly. He could feel
Lews Therin listening.</p>

<p>The tingle returned to his skin, and he very nearly
channeled, but all that happened was that the teapot rose and
floated to Cadsuane, turning slowly in the air for her to examine. &ldquo;Some men who can channel begin to hear voices.&rdquo; She spoke almost
absently, frowning at the flattened sphere of silver and gold. &ldquo;It
is a part of the madness. Voices conversing with them, telling them
what to do.&rdquo; The teapot drifted gently to the floor by her feet. &ldquo;Have you heard any?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Startlingly, Dashiva gave a raucous laugh, shoulders
shaking. Narishma wet his lips; he might not have been afraid of
the woman before, but now he watched her closely as a scorpion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will ask the questions,&rdquo; Rand said firmly. &ldquo;You
seem to forget. I am the Dragon Reborn.&rdquo; <em>You</em> are <em>real,
aren&rsquo;t you?</em> he wondered. There was no answer. <em>Lews
Therin?</em> Sometimes the man did not answer, but Aes Sedai always
drew him. <em>Lews Therin?</em> He was not mad; the voice was real,
not imagination. Not madness. A sudden desire to laugh did not
help.</p>

<p>Cadsuane sighed. &ldquo;You are a young man who has little
idea where he is going or why, or what lies ahead. You seem
overwrought. Perhaps we can speak when you are more settled. Have
you any objection to my taking Merana and Annoura away for a little
while? I&rsquo;ve seen neither in quite some time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand gaped at her. She swooped in, insulted him,
threatened him, casually announced she knew about the voice in his
head, and with that she wanted to leave and talk with Merana and
Annoura? <em>Is</em> she <em>mad?</em> Still no answer from Lews
Therin. The man was real. He was!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Go away, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He was not
mad. &ldquo;All of you, get out! Get out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dashiva blinked at him, tilting his head, then
shrugged and started for the door. Cadsuane smiled in such a way
that he half-expected her to tell him again he was a good boy, then
gathered up Merana and Annoura and herded them toward the Maidens,
who were lowering their veils and frowning worriedly. Narishma
looked at him too, hesitating until Rand gestured sharply. Finally
they were all gone, and he was alone. Alone.</p>

<p>Convulsively he hurled the Dragon Scepter. The
spear-point stuck quivering in the back of one the chairs, the
tassels swaying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not mad,&rdquo; he said to the empty room. Lews
Therin had told him things; he would never have escaped
Galina&rsquo;s chest without the dead man&rsquo;s voice. But he had
used the Power before he ever heard the voice; he had figured out
how to call lightning and hurl fire and form a construct that had
killed hundreds of Trollocs. But then, maybe that had been Lews
Therin, like those memories of climbing trees in a plum orchard,
and entering the Hall of the Servants, and a dozen more that crept
up on him unawares. And maybe those memories were all fancies, mad
dreams of a mad mind, just like the voice.</p>

<p>He realized he was pacing, and could not stop. He
felt as if he had to move or his muscles would tear him apart in
spasms. &ldquo;I am not mad,&rdquo; he panted. Not yet. &ldquo;I am not&mdash;&rdquo; The
sound of the door opening made him whirl, hoping for Min.</p>

<p>It was Riallin again, supporting a short stocky woman
in a dark blue dress, with hair more gray than not and a blunt
face. A haggard, red-eyed face.</p>

<p>He wanted to tell them to go away, to leave him
alone. Alone. Was he alone? Was Lews Therin a dream? If only they
would leave him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Idrien Tarsin was the head of the school he
had founded here in Cairhien, a woman so practical he was not sure
she believed in the One Power since she could neither see nor touch
it. What could reduce her to this state?</p>

<p>He made himself turn toward her. Mad or not, alone or
not, there was no one else to do what had to be done. Not even this
small duty. Heavier than a mountain. &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; he
asked, making his voice as gentle as he could.</p>

<p>Suddenly weeping, Idrien stumbled to him and
collapsed against his chest. When she was coherent enough to tell
her story, he felt like weeping too.</p>
