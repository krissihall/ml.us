passed through the struggling mob without any
difficulty, of course. Maybe it was the presence of the Maidens and
the Asha&rsquo;man, or maybe Rand or one of the black-coated fellows
did something with the Power, but the crowd parted for him, with
Min holding to his arm, and a very subdued Annoura attempting to
speak to him, and Loial, who was still trying with some difficulty
to write in his book <em>and</em> carry his axe. Staring at one another,
Perrin and Faile missed their chance to join them before the crowd
closed up again.</p>

<p>She said nothing for a time, and neither did he, not
what he wanted to say, not with Aram there, staring at them like
some worshipful hound. And Dobraine, frowning down at the
unconscious woman put in his charge. No one else remained on the
dais. Havien had gone with Rand, to find Berelain, and as soon as
Rand went, the other attendants had darted away toward the doors
without a second glance at Perrin or Faile. Or Colavaere. Without
the first glance, for that matter. They just lifted their striped
skirts and ran. Grunts and curses drifted from the pack, not all in
men&rsquo;s voices. Even with Rand gone those people wanted to be
elsewhere, and now. Perhaps they thought Perrin stayed to watch and
report, though had any glanced back, they would have seen his eyes
were not on them.</p>

<p>Climbing the rest of the way, he took Faile&rsquo;s
hand and breathed in the scent of her. This close, the lingering
perfumes did not matter. Anything else could wait. She produced a
red lace fan from somewhere, and before spreading it to cool
herself, touched first her cheek, then his. There was a whole
language of fans in her native Saldaea. She had taught him a
little. He wished he knew what the cheek-touching meant; it must be
something good. On the other hand, her scent carried a spiky
shading he knew too well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He should have sent her to the block,&rdquo; Dobraine
muttered, and Perrin shrugged uncomfortably. From the man&rsquo;s
tone, it was not clear whether he meant that that was what the law
called for or that it would have been more merciful. Dobraine did
not understand. Rand could have sprouted wings first.</p>

<p>Faile&rsquo;s fan slowed to barely moving, and she
eyed Dobraine sideways over the crimson lace. &ldquo;Her death might be
best for everyone. That is the prescribed penalty. What will you
do, Lord Dobraine?&rdquo; Sidelong or not, it still managed to be very
direct, a very meaningful gaze.</p>

<p>Perrin frowned. Not a word for him, but questions for
Dobraine? And there was that undertone of jealousy in her aroma,
making him sigh.</p>

<p>The Cairhienin gave her a level look in return while
thrusting his gauntlets behind his sword belt. &ldquo;What I was
commanded to do. I keep my oaths, Lady Faile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fan snapped open and shut, faster than thought. &ldquo;He actually sent Aes Sedai to the Aiel? As prisoners?&rdquo; Disbelief
tinged her voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some, Lady Faile.&rdquo; Dobraine hesitated. &ldquo;Some swore
fealty on their knees. This I saw with my own eyes. They went to
the Aiel, too, but I do not think they can be called
prisoners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw it, too, my Lady,&rdquo; Aram put in from his place
on the steps, and a wide smile split his face when she glanced at
him.</p>

<p>Red lace described a fluttering hitch. What she did
with the fan seemed almost unconscious. &ldquo;You both saw.&rdquo; The relief
in her voice&mdash;and in her scent&mdash;was so strong that
Perrin stared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you think, Faile? Why would Rand lie,
especially when everyone would know in a day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instead of answering immediately, she frowned down at
Colavaere. &ldquo;Is she still under? Not that it matters, I suppose. She
knows more than I would say here. Everything we worked so hard to
keep hidden. She let that slip to Maire, too. She knows too
much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dobraine thumbed one of Colavaere&rsquo;s eyes open
none too gently. &ldquo;As if hit with a mace. A pity she did not break
her neck on the steps. But she will go to her exile and learn to
live as a farmer.&rdquo; A brief, jaggedy, vexed smell wafted from
Faile.</p>

<p>Abruptly it hit Perrin what his wife had been
proposing so obliquely; what Dobraine had rejected just as
indirectly. Every hair on his body tried to stand. From the start
he had known that he had married a very dangerous woman. Just not
how dangerous. Aram was peering at Colavaere, his lips pursed in
dark thought; the man would do anything for Faile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Rand would like it if anything
prevented her reaching that farm,&rdquo; Perrin said firmly, eyeing Aram
and Faile in turn. &ldquo;<em>I</em> wouldn&rsquo;t like it, either.&rdquo; He
felt rather proud of himself. That was talking around the point as
well as any of them.</p>

<p>Aram bowed his head briefly&mdash;he understood&mdash;but Faile tried to look innocent above her gently fluttering
fan, with no notion what he was talking about. Suddenly he realized
not all the fear scent came from the people still milling at the
door. A thin, quivering thread of it wafted from her. Fear under
control, yet it was there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Faile? Light, you&rsquo;d
think Coiren and that lot had won instead of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Her face did
not change, but the thread grew thicker. &ldquo;Is that why you
didn&rsquo;t say anything at first?&rdquo; he asked softly. &ldquo;Were you
afraid we had come back as puppets, and them pulling the
strings?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She eyed the rapidly diminishing crowd across the
Grand Hall. The nearest of them was a long way, and all making a
good deal of noise, but she lowered her voice even so. &ldquo;Aes Sedai
can do that sort of thing, I&rsquo;ve heard. My husband, no one
knows more than I that even Aes Sedai would find hard times trying
to make you dance for a puppet, much harder than a man who&rsquo;s
just the Dragon Reborn, but when you walked in here, I was more
afraid than at any time since you left.&rdquo; Amusement trickled through
in the first of that, like tiny bubbles in his nose, and warm
fondness, and love, the smell of her, clear and pure and strong,
but all of those faded by the end, leaving that thin trembling
thread.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light, Faile, it&rsquo;s true. Every word Rand said.
You heard Dobraine, and Aram.&rdquo; She smiled, and nodded, and worked
her fan. That thread still quivered in his nostrils, though. <em>Blood and ashes, what does it take to convince her?</em> &ldquo;Would it
help if he had Verin dance the <em>sa&rsquo;sara</em>? She will, if
he tells her to.&rdquo; He meant it for a joke. All he knew of the <em>sa&rsquo;sara</em> was that it was scandalous&mdash;and that Faile
had once admitted knowing how to dance it, though recently she
sidestepped and all but denied it. He meant it for a joke, but she
closed her fan and tapped it on her wrist. He knew that one: <em>I
am giving your suggestion serious thought.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what would be enough, Perrin.&rdquo; She
shivered slightly. &ldquo;Is there anything an Aes Sedai would not do, or
put up with, if the White Tower told her to? I have studied my
history, and I was taught to read between the lines. Mashera
Donavelle bore seven children for a man she loathed, whatever the
stories say, and Isebaille Tobanyi delivered the brothers she loved
to their enemies and the throne of Arad Doman with them, and
Jestian Redhill&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She shivered again, not so slightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he murmured, wrapping her in
his arms. He had studied several books of history himself, but he
had never seen those names. The daughter of a lord received a
different education from a blacksmith&rsquo;s apprentice. &ldquo;It really
is true.&rdquo; Dobraine averted his eyes, and so did Aram, though with a
pleased grin.</p>

<p>She resisted at first, but not very hard. He could
never be sure when she would avoid a public embrace and when
welcome it, only that if she did not want one, she made it clear in
no uncertain terms, with or without words. This time she snuggled
her face into his chest and hugged him back, squeezing harder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If any Aes Sedai ever harms you,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;I
will kill her.&rdquo; He believed her. &ldquo;You belong to me, Perrin t&rsquo;
Bashere Aybara. To me.&rdquo; He believed that, too. As her hug grew
fiercer, so did the thorny scent of jealousy. He almost chuckled.
It seemed the right to put a knife in him was reserved to her. He
would have chuckled, except that filament of fear remained. That,
and what she had said about Maire. He could not smell himself, but
he knew what was there. Fear. Old fear, and new fear, for the next
time.</p>

<p>The last of the nobles forced their way from the
Grand Hall, without anyone being trampled. Sending Aram off to tell
Dannil to bring the Two Rivers men into the city&mdash;and
wondering how he was going to feed them&mdash;Perrin offered Faile
his arm and led her out, leaving Dobraine with Colavaere, who was
finally showing signs of awakening. He had no wish to be around
when she woke, and Faile, with her hand on his wrist, seemed not to
either. They walked quickly, eager to reach their rooms, if not
necessarily for the same reasons.</p>

<p>The nobles apparently had not stopped their flight
once they were out of the Grand Hall. The corridors were empty
except for servants who kept their eyes down at a silent rush, but
before they had gone very far, Perrin caught the sound of footsteps
and realized they were being followed. It seemed unlikely that
Colavaere had any open supporters still, but if there were any,
they might think to strike at Rand through his friend, walking
alone with his wife while the Dragon Reborn was elsewhere.</p>

<p>Only, when Perrin spun about, hand to his axe, he
stared instead of drawing the weapon. It was Selande and her
friends from the entry hall, with eight or nine new faces. They
gave a start when he turned, and exchanged abashed glances. Some
were Tairens, including a woman who stood taller than all but one
of the Cairhienin men. She wore a man&rsquo;s coat and tight
breeches, just like Selande and the rest of the women, with a sword
on her hip. He had not heard that this nonsense had spread to the
Tairens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you following us?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;If you try
to make me any of your wool-head trouble, I vow I&rsquo;ll kick the
lot of you from here to Bel Tine!&rdquo; He had had problems before with
these idiots, or some just like them, anyway. All they thought
about was their honor, and fighting duels, and taking one another
<em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>. That last really set the Aiel&rsquo;s teeth
on edge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Attend my husband and obey,&rdquo; Faile put in sharply. &ldquo;He is not a man to be trifled with.&rdquo; Gawking stares vanished, and
they backed away, bowing, competing over flourishes. They were
still at it when they vanished around a turn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bloody young buffoons,&rdquo; Perrin muttered, offering
Faile his wrist again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My husband is wise in his years,&rdquo; she murmured. Her
tone was utterly serious; her smell was something else again.</p>

<p>Perrin managed not to snort. True, a few of them
might be a year or two older than he, but they all were like
children with their playing at Aiel. Now, with Faile in a good
mood, seemed as good a time as any to begin what they had to talk
about. What he had to talk about. &ldquo;Faile, how did you come to be
one of Colavaere&rsquo;s attendants?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The servants, Perrin.&rdquo; She spoke softly; nobody two
steps away could have heard a word. She knew all about his hearing,
and the wolves. That was nothing a man could keep from his wife.
Her fan touched her ear, admonishing caution in speech. &ldquo;Too many
people forget servants are there, but servants listen too. In
Cairhien, they listen far too much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>None of the liveried people he saw were doing any
listening. The few who did not duck down side corridors when they
saw him and Faile went by at a near run, gazes on the floor and
gathered in on themselves. Any sort of news spread quickly in
Cairhien. Events in the Grand Hall would have flown. The word was
in the streets by now, probably on its way out of the city already.
Without any doubt there were eyes-and-ears in Cairhien for the Aes
Sedai, and the Whitecloaks, and likely more thrones than not.</p>

<p>In that hushed voice, she went on despite her caution
to him. &ldquo;Colavaere could not be fast enough to take me in, once she
learned who I am. My father&rsquo;s name impressed her as much as my
cousin&rsquo;s.&rdquo; She finished with a little nod, as if she had
answered everything.</p>

<p>It was a good enough answer. Almost. Her father was
Davram, High Seat of House Bashere, Lord of Bashere, Tyr and
Sidona, Guardian of the Blightborder, Defender of the Heartland,
and Marshal-General to Queen Tenobia of Saldaea. Faile&rsquo;s
cousin was Tenobia herself. More than reason for Colavaere to leap
at Faile for one of her attendants. But he had had time to mull
things over now, and he prided himself that he was becoming used to
her ways. Married life taught a man about women; or about one
woman, anyway. The answer she had not given confirmed something.
Faile had no concept of danger, not where she herself was
concerned.</p>

<p>He could not speak of it there in the corridor, of
course. Whisper how he would, she did not have his ears, and
doubtless she would insist every servant within fifty was
listening. Holding his patience, he walked on with her until they
reached the rooms that had been set aside for them what seemed an
age ago now. The lamps had been lit, making shimmers on the dark
polished walls, each tall wooden panel carved in concentric
rectangles. In the square stone fireplace the hearth was swept bare
and laid with a few pitiful branches of leatherleaf. They were
almost green.</p>

<p>Faile went straight to a small table where two golden
pitchers stood beaded with moisture on a tray. &ldquo;They have left us
blueberry tea, my husband, and wine punch. The wine is from Tharon,
I think. They cool the punch in the cisterns beneath the palace.
Which would you prefer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin unbuckled his belt and tossed belt and axe on
a chair. He had planned out what he had to say very carefully on
the way here. She could be a prickly woman. &ldquo;Faile, I missed you
more than I can say, and worried about you, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Worried about me!&rdquo; she snapped, spinning to face
him. She stood straight and tall, eyes fierce as those of her
falcon namesake, and her fan made a coring motion toward his
middle. Not part of the language of fans; she made the same gesture
with a knife sometimes. &ldquo;When almost the first words from your
mouth were to ask after that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that <em>woman</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His jaw dropped. How could he have forgotten the
smell filling his nostrils? He nearly put a hand up to see whether
his nose was bleeding. &ldquo;Faile, I wanted her thief-catchers. Be&mdash;&rdquo; No, he was not stupid enough to repeat that name. &ldquo;She
said she had proof of the poison before I left. You heard her! I
just wanted the proof, Faile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It did no good. That spiky stench softened not a
whit, and the thin, sour smell of hurt joined it. What under the
Light had he said to hurt her?</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Her</em> proof! What <em>I</em> gathered went
for nothing, but her proof put Colavaere&rsquo;s head on the block.
Or should have.&rdquo; That was his opening, but she was not about to let
him push a word in edgewise. She advanced on him, looking daggers,
her fan darting like one. All he could do was back away. &ldquo;Do you
know what story that woman put about?&rdquo; Faile almost hissed. A black
viper could not have dripped so much venom. &ldquo;Do you? She said the
reason you were not here was that you were at a manor not far from
the city. Where she could <em>visit</em> you! I told the story I
prepared&mdash;that you were hunting, and the Light knows you
spent enough days hunting!&mdash;but everyone believed I was
putting a good face on you and her! Together! Colavaere delighted
in it. I could believe she only took that Mayener strumpet as an
attendant to throw the two of us together. &lsquo;Faile, Berelain,
come lace my gown.&rsquo; &lsquo;Faile, Berelain, come hold the
mirror for the hairdresser.&rsquo; &lsquo;Faile, Berelain, come wash
my back.&rsquo; So she could amuse herself waiting for us to claw
one another&rsquo;s eyes out! That is what I have put up with! For
you, you hairy-eared&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His back thumped against the wall. And something
snapped inside him. He had been frightened spitless for her,
terrified, ready to face down Rand or the Dark One himself. And he
had done nothing, had never encouraged Berelain, had done
everything in his wits to chase the woman away. For which his
thanks was this.</p>

<p>Gently he took her by the shoulders and lifted her
until those big tilted eyes were level with his. &ldquo;You listen to
me,&rdquo; he said calmly. He tried to make his voice calm, at least; it
came out more of a growl in his throat. &ldquo;How dare you speak to me
like that? How <em>dare</em> you? I worried myself near to death
for fear you&rsquo;d been hurt. I love you, and nobody else but you.
I want no other woman but you. Do you hear me? Do you?&rdquo; Crushing
her to his chest, he held her, wanting to never let her go. Light,
he had been so afraid. He shook even now, for what might have been. &ldquo;If anything happened to you, I&rsquo;d die, Faile. I would lie down
on your grave and die! Do you think I don&rsquo;t know how Colavaere
found out who you are? You made sure she found out.&rdquo; Spying, she
had told him once, was a woman&rsquo;s work. &ldquo;Light, woman, you
could have ended like Maire. Colavaere knows you&rsquo;re my wife.
<em>My</em> wife. Perrin Aybara, Rand al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s friend.
Did it ever occur to you she might be suspicious? She could have&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Light, Faile, she could have&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly he realized what he was doing. She was
making sounds against his chest, but no words he could recognize.
He wondered that he did not hear her ribs creaking. Berating
himself for an oaf, he let her go, arms springing apart, but before
he could apologize, her fingers clutched his beard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you love me?&rdquo; she said softly. Very softly. Very
warmly. She was smiling, too. &ldquo;A woman likes to hear that said the
right way.&rdquo; She had dropped the fan, and her free hand drew
fingernails down his cheek, not far from hard enough to draw blood,
but her throaty laugh held heat, and the smoldering in her eyes was
as far from anger as possible. &ldquo;A good thing you didn&rsquo;t say
you never looked at another woman, or I would think you had gone
blind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was too stunned for words, too stunned even to
gape. Rand understood women, Mat understood women, but Perrin knew
he never would. She was always as much kingfisher as falcon,
changing direction faster than he could think, yet this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;That
thorny scent was gone completely, and in its place was another
smell of her he knew well. A smell that was her, pure and strong
and clean. Add that to her eyes, and any moment she was going to
say something about farmgirls at harvest. They were notorious,
apparently, Saldaean farmgirls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for you lying down on my grave,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;if
you do, my soul will haunt yours, I promise you. You will mourn me
a decent time, and then you&rsquo;ll find yourself another wife.
Someone I&rsquo;d approve of, I hope.&rdquo; With a soft laugh, she
stroked his beard. &ldquo;You really aren&rsquo;t fit to take care of
yourself, you know. I want your promise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Best not to crack his teeth on that. Say he would
not, and this wonderful mood might be swallowed in a firestorm.
Quicksilver was not in it, really. Say he would&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;By the smell
of her, every word was the Light&rsquo;s pure truth, but he would
believe that when horses roosted in trees. He cleared his throat. &ldquo;I need to bathe. I haven&rsquo;t seen soap in I don&rsquo;t know how
long. I must smell like an old barn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leaning against his chest, she drew a deep breath. &ldquo;You smell wonderful. Like you.&rdquo; Her hands moved on his shoulders. &ldquo;I feel as&mdash;&rdquo; The door banged open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perrin, Berelain isn&rsquo;t&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry.
Forgive me.&rdquo; Rand stood shifting his feet, not at all like the
Dragon Reborn. There were Maidens in the hallway outside. Min put
her head around the doorframe, took one look, grinned at Perrin and
ducked back out of sight.</p>

<p>Faile stepped away so smoothly, so stately, that no
one would ever have guessed what she had been saying a moment
before. Or what she had been about to say. There were spots of
color in her cheeks, though, bright and hot. &ldquo;So kind of you, my
Lord Dragon,&rdquo; she said coolly, &ldquo;to drop in so unexpectedly. I
apologize for not hearing your knock.&rdquo; Maybe those blushes were as
much anger as embarrassment.</p>

<p>It was Rand&rsquo;s turn to blush, and scrub a hand
through his hair. &ldquo;Berelain isn&rsquo;t in the palace. She&rsquo;s
spending the night on that Sea Folk ship anchored in the river, of
all things. Annoura didn&rsquo;t tell me till I was nearly to
Berelain&rsquo;s apartments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin tried very hard not to wince. Why did he have
to keep saying the woman&rsquo;s name? &ldquo;You wanted to talk to me
about something else, Rand?&rdquo; He hoped he had not put too much
emphasis in that, yet he hoped Rand caught it. He did not look at
Faile, but he tested the air gingerly. No jealousy, not yet. A good
deal of anger, however.</p>

<p>For a moment Rand stared at him, looked through him.
Listening to something else. Perrin folded his arms to stop from
shuddering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I need to know,&rdquo; Rand said finally. &ldquo;Are you still
unwilling to command the army against Illian? I have to know
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no general,&rdquo; Perrin said raggedly. There
would be battles in Illian. Images flashed in his head. Men all
around him, and the axe in his hands spinning, hewing his way
through. Always more men, however many he cut down, in endless
ranks. And in his heart, a seed growing. He could not face that
again. He would not. &ldquo;Besides, I thought I was supposed to stay
close to you.&rdquo; That was what Min had said, from one of her
viewings. Twice Perrin had to be there, or Rand would go down to
disaster. Once had been Dumai&rsquo;s Wells, maybe, but there was
still another to come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We all must take risks.&rdquo; Rand&rsquo;s voice was very
quiet. And very hard. Min peered around the doorframe again,
looking as if she wanted to come to him, but she glanced at Faile
and stayed outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand, the Aes Sedai&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; A smart man would let
this lie, probably. He had never claimed to be particularly smart,
though. &ldquo;The Wise Ones are ready to skin them alive, or near
enough. You can&rsquo;t let them be harmed, Rand.&rdquo; In the corridor,
Sulin turned to study him through the doorway.</p>

<p>The man he thought he knew laughed, a wheezing sound. &ldquo;We all have to take risks,&rdquo; he repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let them be hurt, Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cold blue eyes met his gaze. &ldquo;<em>You</em> won&rsquo;t
let it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Perrin told him levelly. He
did not flinch from that stare, either. &ldquo;They are prisoners, and no
threat. They&rsquo;re women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are Aes Sedai.&rdquo; Rand&rsquo;s voice was so like
Aram&rsquo;s back at Dumai&rsquo;s Wells that it nearly took
Perrin&rsquo;s breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do what I have to do, Perrin.&rdquo; For a moment he was
the old Rand, not liking what was happening. For a moment he looked
tired to death. A moment only. Then he was the new Rand again, hard
enough to mark steel. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t harm any Aes Sedai who
doesn&rsquo;t deserve it, Perrin. I can&rsquo;t promise more. Since
you don&rsquo;t want the army, I can use you elsewhere. Just as
well, really. I wish I could let you rest longer than a day or two,
but I can&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s no time. No time, and we must do
what we must. Forgive me for interrupting you.&rdquo; He sketched a bow,
one hand on the hilt of his sword. &ldquo;Faile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin tried to catch his arm, but he was out of the
room, the door closing behind him, before Perrin could move. Rand
was not really Rand anymore, it seemed. A day or two? Where in the
Light did Rand mean him to go, if not to the army gathering down on
the Plains of Maredo?</p>

<p>&ldquo;My husband,&rdquo; Faile breathed, &ldquo;you have the courage
of three men. And the sense of a child on leading strings. Why is
it that as a man&rsquo;s courage goes up, his sense goes down?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin grunted indignantly. He refrained from
mentioning women who set themselves to spy on people who had
committed murders and almost certainly knew they were spying. Women
always talked about how logical they were compared to men, but for
himself, he had seen precious little of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps I don&rsquo;t really want the answer
even if you know it.&rdquo; Stretching with her arms over her head, she
gave a throaty laugh. &ldquo;Besides, I don&rsquo;t mean to let him spoil
the mood. I still feel as forward as a farmgirl at&mdash;Why are
you laughing? Stop laughing at me, Perrin t&rsquo;Bashere Aybara!
Stop it, I say, you uncouth oaf! If you don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The only way to put an end to it was to kiss her. In
her arms he forgot Rand and Aes Sedai and battles. Where Faile was,
was home.</p>
