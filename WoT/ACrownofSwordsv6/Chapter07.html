<h4><em>Pitfalls and Tripwires</em></h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">R</span>and
felt the Dragon Scepter in his hand, felt every
line of the carved Dragons against his heron-branded palm as
clearly as if he were running his fingers over them, yet it seemed
someone else&rsquo;s hand. If a blade cut it off, he would feel the
pain&mdash;and keep going. It would be another&rsquo;s pain.</p>

<p>He floated in the Void, surrounded by emptiness
beyond knowing, and <em>saidin</em> filled him, trying to grind him
to dust beneath steel-shattering cold and heat where stone would
flash to flame, carrying the Dark One&rsquo;s taint on its flow,
forcing corruption into his bones. Into his soul, he feared
sometimes. It did not make him feel so sick to his stomach as it
once had. He feared that even more. And larded through that torrent
of fire, ice and filth&mdash;life. That was the best word. <em>Saidin</em> tried to destroy him. <em>Saidin</em> filled him to
overflowing with vitality. It threatened to bury him, and it
enticed him. The war for survival, the struggle to avoid being
consumed, magnified the joy of pure life. So sweet even with the
foulness. What would it be like, clean? Beyond imagining. He wanted
to draw more, draw all there was.</p>

<p>There lay the deadly seduction. One slip, and the
ability to channel would be seared out of him forever. One slip and
his mind was gone, if he was not simply destroyed on the spot, and
maybe everything around him too. It was not madness, focusing on
the fight for existence; it was like highwalking blindfolded over a
pit full of sharpened stakes, basking in so pure a sense of life
that thinking of giving it up was like thinking of a world forever
in shades of gray. Not madness.</p>

<p>His thoughts whirled through his dance with <em>saidin</em>, slid across the Void. Annoura, peering at him with
that Aes Sedai gaze. What was Berelain playing at? She had never
mentioned an Aes Sedai advisor. And those other Aes Sedai in
Cairhien. Where had they come from, and why? The rebels outside the
city. What had emboldened them to move? What did they intend now?
How could he stop them, or use them? He was becoming good at using
people; sometimes he made himself sick. Sevanna and the Shaido.
Rhuarc already had scouts on the way to Kinslayer&rsquo;s Dagger,
but at best they could only find out where and when. The Wise Ones
who could find out why, would not. There were a lot of why&rsquo;s
connected to Sevanna. Elayne, and Aviendha. No, he would not think
of them. No thoughts of them. None. Perrin, and Faile. A fierce
woman, falcon by name and nature. Had she really attached herself
to Colavaere just to gather evidence? She would try to protect
Perrin if the Dragon Reborn fell. Protect him from the Dragon
Reborn, should she decide it necessary; her loyalties were to
Perrin, but she would decide for herself how to meet them. Faile
was no woman to do meekly as her husband told her, if such a woman
existed. Golden eyes, staring challenge and defiance. Why was
Perrin so vehement about the Aes Sedai? He had been a long time
with Kiruna and her companions on the road to Dumai&rsquo;s Wells.
Could Aes Sedai really do with him what everybody feared? Aes
Sedai. He shook his head without being aware. Never again. Never!
To trust was to be betrayed; trust was pain.</p>

<p>He tried to push that thought away. It came a little
too close to raving. Nobody could live without giving trust
somewhere. Just not to Aes Sedai. Mat, Perrin. If he could not
trust them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Min. Never a thought of not trusting Min. He
wished she were with him, instead of snugged in her bed. All those
days a prisoner, days of worry&mdash;more for him than herself, if
he knew her&mdash;days of being questioned by Galina and
ill-treated when her answers failed to please&mdash;unconsciously
he ground his teeth&mdash;all of that, and the strain of being
Healed on top of it, had caught up with her at last. She had stayed
by his side until her legs gave way, and he had to carry her to her
bedchamber, with her sleepily protesting all the way that he needed
her with him. No Min here, no comforting presence to make him
laugh, make him forget the Dragon Reborn. Only the war with <em>saidin</em>, and the whirlwind of his thoughts, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>They must be done away with. You must do it.
Don&rsquo;t you remember the last time? That place by the wells was
a pittance. Cities burned whole out of the earth were nothing. We
destroyed the world! DO YOU HEAR ME? THEY HAVE TO BE KILLED, WIPED
FROM THE FACE&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!</em></p>

<p>Not his, that voice shouting inside his skull. Not
Rand al&rsquo;Thor. Lews Therin Telamon, more than three thousand
years dead. And talking in Rand al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s head. The Power
often drew him out of his hiding place in the shadows of
Rand&rsquo;s mind. Sometimes Rand wondered how that could be. He was
Lews Therin reborn, the Dragon Reborn, no denying that, but
everybody was someone reborn, a hundred someones, a thousand, more.
That was how the Pattern worked; everyone died and was reborn,
again and again as the Wheel turned, forever without end. But
nobody else talked with who they used to be. Nobody else had voices
in their heads. Except madmen.</p>

<p><em>What about me</em>, Rand thought. One hand
tightened on the Dragon Scepter, the other on his sword hilt. <em>What about you? How are we different from them?</em></p>

<p>There was only silence. Often enough, Lews Therin did
not answer. Maybe it had been better when he never had.</p>

<p><em>Are you real?</em> the voice said at last,
wonderingly. That denial of Rand&rsquo;s existence was as usual as
refusing to answer. <em>Am I? I spoke to someone. I think I did.
Inside a box. A chest</em>. Wheezing laughter, soft. <em>Am I dead,
or mad, or both? No matter. I am surely damned. I am damned, and
this is the Pit of Doom, I am&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;d-damned</em>, wild, that
laughing, now, <em>and t-this&mdash;is the P-Pit of&mdash;</em></p>

<p>Rand muted the voice to an insect&rsquo;s buzz,
something he had learned while cramped into that chest. Alone, in
the dark. Just him, and the pain, and the thirst, and the voice of
a long-dead madman. The voice had been a comfort sometimes, his
only companion. His friend. Something flashed in his mind. Not
images, just flickers of color and motion. For some reason they
made him think of Mat, and Perrin. The flashes had begun inside the
chest, them and a thousand more hallucinations. In the chest, where
Galina and Erian and Katerine and the rest stuffed him every day
after he was beaten. He shook his head. No. He was not in the chest
anymore. His fingers ached, clenched around scepter and hilt. Only
memories remained, and memories had no force. He was not&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we must make this journey before you eat, let us
make it. The evening meal is long finished for everyone else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand blinked, and Sulin stepped back from his stare.
Sulin, who would stand eye-to-eye with a leopard. He smoothed his
face, tried to. It felt a mask, somebody else&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you well?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was thinking.&rdquo; He made his hands unknot, shrugged
inside his coat. A better-fitting coat than the one he had worn
from Dumai&rsquo;s Wells, dark blue and plain. Even after a bath he
did not feel clean, not with <em>saidin</em> in him. &ldquo;Sometimes I
think too much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nearly twenty more Maidens clustered at one end of
the windowless, dark-paneled room. Eight gilded stand-lamps against
the walls, mirrored to increase the light, provided illumination.
He was glad of that; he did not like dark places anymore. Three of
the Asha&rsquo;man were there, too, the Aiel women to one side of
the chamber, the Asha&rsquo;man to the other. Jonan Adley, an
Altaran despite his name, stood with his arms folded, working
eyebrows like black caterpillars in deep thought. Perhaps four
years older than Rand, he was intent on earning the silver sword of
the Dedicated. Eben Hopwil carried more flesh on his bones and
fewer blotches on his face than when Rand had first seen him,
though his nose and ears still seemed the biggest part of him. He
fingered the sword pin on his collar as if surprised to find it
there. Fedwin Morr would have worn the sword as well, had he not
been in a green coat suitable for a well-to-do merchant or a minor
noble, with a little silver embroidery on cuffs and lapels. Of an
age with Eben, but stockier and with almost no blotches, he did not
look happy that his black coat was stuffed into the leather scrip
by his feet. They were the ones Lews Therin had been raving about,
them and all the rest of the Asha&rsquo;man. Asha&rsquo;man, Aes
Sedai, anyone who could channel set him off, often as not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think too much, Rand al&rsquo;Thor?&rdquo; Enaila gripped a
short spear in one hand and her buckler and three more spears in
the other, yet she sounded as if she were shaking a finger at him.
The Asha&rsquo;man frowned at her. &ldquo;Your trouble is, you do not
think at all.&rdquo; Some of the other Maidens laughed softly, but she
was not making a joke. Shorter than any other Maiden there by at
least a hand, she had hair as fiery as her temper, and an odd view
of her relationship to him. Her flaxen-haired friend Somara, who
stood head and shoulders taller, nodded agreement; she held the
same peculiar view.</p>

<p>He ignored the comment, but could not stop a sigh.
Somara and Enaila were the worst, yet none of the Maidens could
decide whether he was the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>, to be
obeyed, or the only child of a Maiden ever known to the Maidens, to
be cared for as a brother, bullied as a son for a few. Even Jalani
there, not many years from playing with dolls, seemed to think he
was her younger brother, while Corana, graying and nearly as
leather-faced as Sulin, treated him like an older. At least they
only did that around themselves, not often where other Aiel could
hear. When it counted, he would be the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>. And he owed it to them. They died for
him. He owed them whatever they wanted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t intend to spend all night here while
you lot play Kiss the Daisies,&rdquo; he said. Sulin gave him one of
those looks&mdash;in dresses or in <em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em>, women
tossed those looks about like farmers scattering seed&mdash;but
the Asha&rsquo;man abandoned staring at the Maidens and slung the
straps of their scrips over their shoulders. Push them hard, he had
told Taim, make them weapons, and Taim had delivered. A good weapon
moved as the man who held it directed. If only he could be sure it
would not turn in his hand.</p>

<p>He had three destinations tonight, but one of those
the Maidens could not be allowed to know. No one but himself. Which
of the other two came first he had decided earlier, yet he
hesitated. The journey would be known soon enough, yet there were
reasons to keep it secret as he could.</p>

<p>When the gateway opened there in the middle of the
room, a sweetish smell familiar to any farmer drifted through.
Horse dung. Wrinkling her nose as she veiled, Sulin led half the
Maidens through at a trot. After a glance to him, the Asha&rsquo;man
followed, drawing deeply on the True Source as they went, as much
as they could hold.</p>

<p>Because of that, he could feel their strength as they
passed him. Without that, it took some effort to tell a man could
channel, longer still unless he cooperated. None were near as
strong as he. Not yet, anyway; there was no saying how strong a man
would be until he stopped growing stronger. Fedwin stood highest of
the three, but he had what Taim called a bar. Fedwin did not really
believe he could affect anything at a distance with the Power. The
result was that at fifty paces his ability began to fade, and at a
hundred he could not weave even a thread of <em>saidin</em>. Men
gained strength faster than women, it seemed, and a good thing.
These three were all strong enough to make a gateway of useful
size, if just barely in Jonan&rsquo;s case. Every Asha&rsquo;man was
that he had kept.</p>

<p><em>Kill them before it is too late, before they go
mad</em>, Lews Therin whispered. <em>Kill them, hunt down Sammael,
and Demandred, and all the Forsaken. I have to kill them all,
before it is too late!</em> A moment of struggle as he attempted to
wrest the Power away from Rand and failed. He seemed to try that
more often of late, or to seize <em>saidin</em> on his own. The
second was a bigger danger than the first. Rand doubted that Lews
Therin could take the True Source away once Rand held it; he was
not certain he could take it from Lews Therin, either, if the other
reached it first.</p>

<p><em>What about me?</em> Rand thought again. It was
nearly a snarl, and no less vicious for falling short. Wrapped in
the Power as he was, anger spiderwebbed across the outside of the
Void, a fiery lace. <em>I can channel, too. Madness waits for me,
but it already has you! You killed yourself, Kinslayer, after you
murdered your wife and your children and the Light alone knows how
many others. I won&rsquo;t kill where I don&rsquo;t have to! Do you
hear me, Kinslayer?</em> Silence answered.</p>

<p>He drew a deep, uneven breath. That web of fire
flickered, lightning in the distance. He had never spoken to the
man&mdash;it was the man, not just a voice; a man, entire with
memories&mdash;never spoken to him like that before. Perhaps it
might drive Lews Therin away for good. Half the man&rsquo;s mad
rantings were tears over his dead wife. Did he want to drive Lews
Therin away? His only friend in that chest.</p>

<p>He had promised Sulin to count to one hundred before
following, but he did it by fives, then stepped more than a hundred
and fifty leagues to Caemlyn.</p>

<p>Night had closed down on the Royal Palace of Andor,
moonshadows cloaking delicate spires and golden domes, but a gentle
breeze did nothing to break the heat. The moon hung above, still
almost full, giving some light. Veiled Maidens scurried around the
wagons lined up behind the largest of the palace stables. The odor
of the stable muck the wagons hauled away every day had long since
soaked into the wood. The Asha&rsquo;man had hands to their faces,
Eben actually pinching his nose shut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> counts quickly,&rdquo;
Sulin muttered, but she lowered her veil. There would be no
surprises here. No one would stay near those wagons who did not
have to.</p>

<p>Rand let the gateway close as soon as the remaining
Maidens came through, right behind him, and as it winked out of
existence, Lews Therin whispered, <em>She is gone. Almost
gone</em>. There was relief in his voice; the bond of Warder and
Aes Sedai had not existed in the Age of Legends.</p>

<p>Alanna was not really gone, no more than she had been
any time since bonding Rand against his will, but her presence had
lessened, and it was the lessening that made Rand truly aware. You
could become used to anything, begin taking it for granted. Near to
her, he walked around with her emotions nestled in the back of his
head, her physical condition as well, if he thought about it, and
he knew exactly where she was as well as he knew his own his
hand&rsquo;s place; but just as with his hand, unless he thought
about it, it just was. Only distance had any effect, but he could
still <em>feel</em> that she was somewhere east of him. He wanted
to be aware of her. Should Lews Therin fall silent and all the
memories of the chest somehow be wiped from his head, he would
still have the bond to remind him, &ldquo;Never trust Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly he realized that Jonan and Eben still held
<em>saidin</em> too. &ldquo;Release,&rdquo; he said sharply&mdash;that was the
command Taim used&mdash;and he felt the Power vanish from them.
Good weapons. So far. <em>Kill them before it&rsquo;s too late</em>,
Lews Therin murmured. Rand released the Source deliberately, and
reluctantly. He always hated letting go of the life, the enhanced
senses. Of the struggle. Inside, though, he was tense, a jumper
ready to leap, ready to seize it once more. He always was, now.</p>

<p><em>I have to kill them</em>, Lews Therin
whispered.</p>

<p>Shoving the voice back, Rand sent one of the Maidens,
Nerilea, a square-faced woman, into the palace and began pacing
alongside the wagons, thoughts spinning again, faster than before.
He should not have come here. He should have sent Fedwin, with a
letter. Spinning. Elayne. Aviendha. Perrin. Faile. Annoura.
Berelain. Mat. Light, he should not have come. Elayne and Aviendha.
Annoura and Berelain. Faile and Perrin and Mat. Flashes of color,
quick motion just out of sight. A madman muttering angrily in the
distance.</p>

<p>Slowly he became aware of the Maidens talking among
themselves. About the smell. Implying that it came from the
Asha&rsquo;man. They wanted to be heard, or they would have been
using handtalk; there was moonlight enough for that. Moonlight
enough to see the color in Eben&rsquo;s face, too, and how
Fedwin&rsquo;s jaw was set. Maybe they were not boys any longer, not
since Dumai&rsquo;s Wells certainly, but they were still only
fifteen or sixteen. Jonan&rsquo;s eyebrows had drawn down so far
they seemed to be sitting on his cheeks. At least nobody had seized
<em>saidin</em> again. Yet.</p>

<p>He started to step over to the three men, then raised
his voice instead. Let them all hear. &ldquo;If I can put up with
foolishness from Maidens, so can you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If anything, the color in Eben&rsquo;s face deepened.
Jonan grunted. All three saluted Rand with fist to chest; then they
turned to one another. Jonan said something in a low voice,
glancing at the Maidens, and Fedwin and Eben laughed. The first
time they saw Maidens they had stumbled between wanting to goggle
at these exotic creatures they had only read about and wanting to
run before the murderous Aiel of the stories killed them. Nothing
much frightened them anymore. They needed to relearn fear.</p>

<p>The Maidens stared at Rand, and began talking with
their hands, sometimes laughing softly. Wary of the Asha&rsquo;man
they might be, yet Maidens being Maidens&mdash;Aiel being Aiel&mdash;risk only made taunts more fun. Somara murmured aloud about
Aviendha settling him down, which earned firm nods of approval.
Nobody&rsquo;s life was ever this tangled in the stories.</p>

<p>As soon as Nerilea returned saying that she had found
Davram Bashere and Bael, the clan chief leading the Aiel here in
Caemlyn, Rand took off his sword belt, and so did Fedwin. Jalani
produced a large leather bag for the swords and the Dragon Scepter,
holding it as if the swords were poisonous snakes, or perhaps long
dead and rotten. Though in truth she would not have held it so
gingerly in either case. Putting on a hooded cloak that Corana
handed him, Rand held his wrists together behind his back, and
Sulin bound them with a cord. Tightly, muttering to herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is nonsense. Even wetlanders would call it
nonsense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He tried not to wince. She was strong, and using
every ounce of it. &ldquo;You have run away from us too often, Rand
al&rsquo;Thor. You have no care for yourself.&rdquo; She considered him a
brother of an age with herself, but irresponsible at times. &ldquo;<em>Far Dareis Mai</em> carries your honor, and you have no
care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fedwin glowered while his own wrists were tied,
though the Maiden binding him hardly put out much effort. Watching,
Jonan and Eben frowned deeply. They disliked this plan as much as
Sulin did. And understood it as little. The Dragon Reborn did not
have to explain himself, and the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>
seldom did. No one said anything, though. A weapon did not
complain.</p>

<p>When Sulin stepped around in front of Rand, she took
one look at his face, and her breath caught. &ldquo;They did this to
you,&rdquo; she said softly, and reached for her heavy-bladed belt knife.
A foot or more of steel, it was almost a short-sword, though none
but a fool would say that to an Aiel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pull up the hood,&rdquo; Rand told her roughly. &ldquo;The whole
point of this is that no one recognize me before I reach Bael and
Bashere.&rdquo; She hesitated, peering into his eyes. &ldquo;I said, pull it
up,&rdquo; he growled. Sulin could kill most men with her bare hands, but
her fingers were gentle settling the hood around his face.</p>

<p>With a laugh Jalani snatched the hood down over his
eyes. &ldquo;Now you can be sure no one will know you, Rand al&rsquo;Thor.
You must trust us to guide your feet.&rdquo; Several Maidens laughed.</p>

<p>Stiffening, he barely stopped short of seizing <em>saidin</em>. Barely. Lews Therin snarled and gibbered. Rand forced
himself to breathe normally. It was not total darkness. He could
see moonlight below the edge of the hood. Even so, he stumbled when
Sulin and Enaila took his arms and led him forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you were old enough to walk better than
that,&rdquo; Enaila murmured in mock surprise. Sulin&rsquo;s hand moved.
It took him a moment to realize she was stroking his arm.</p>

<p>All he could see was what lay just before him, the
moonlit flagstones of the stableyard, then stone steps, floors of
marble by lamplight, sometimes with a long runner of carpet. He
strained his eyes at the movement of shadows, felt for the telltale
presence of <em>saidin</em>, or worse, the prickling that announced
a woman holding <em>saidar</em>. Blind like this, he might not know
he was under attack until too late. He could hear the whisper of a
few servants&rsquo; feet as they hurried on nighttime chores, but no
one challenged five Maidens apparently escorting two hooded
prisoners. With Bael and Bashere living in the palace and policing
Caemlyn with their men, doubtless stranger sights had been seen in
these corridors. It was like walking a maze. But then he had been
in one maze or another since leaving Emond&rsquo;s Field, even when
he had thought that he walked a clear path.</p>

<p><em>Would I know a clear path if I saw one?</em> he
wondered. <em>Or have I been at this so long I&rsquo;d think it was
a trap?</em></p>

<p><em>There are no clear paths. Only pitfalls and
tripwires and darkness</em>. Lews Therin&rsquo;s snarl sounded
sweaty, desperate. The way Rand felt.</p>

<p>When Sulin finally led them into a room and shut the
door, Rand tossed his head violently to throw back the hood&mdash;and stared. Bael and Davram he had expected, but not Davram&rsquo;s
wife, Deira, nor Melaine, nor Dorindha.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you, <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>.&rdquo; Bael, the
tallest man Rand had ever seen, sat cross-legged on the
green-and-white floor tiles in his <em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em>, an air
about him even at ease that said he was ready to move in a
heartbeat. The clan chief of the Goshien Aiel was not young&mdash;no clan chief was&mdash;and there was gray in his dark reddish
hair, but anyone who thought him soft with age was in for a sad
surprise. &ldquo;May you always find water and shade. I stand with the
<em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>, and my spears stand with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Water and shade may be all very well,&rdquo; Davram
Bashere said, hooking a leg over the gilded arm of his chair, &ldquo;but
myself I would settle for chilled wine.&rdquo; Little taller than Enaila,
he had his short blue coat undone, and sweat glistened on his dark
face. Despite his apparent indolence, he looked even harder than
Bael, with his fierce tilted eyes, and his eagle&rsquo;s beak of a
nose above thick gray-streaked mustaches. &ldquo;I offer congratulations
on your escape, and your victory. But why do you come disguised as
a prisoner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I prefer to know whether he is bringing Aes Sedai
down on us,&rdquo; Deira put in. A large woman gowned in gold-worked
green silk, Faile&rsquo;s mother stood as tall as any Maiden there
except Somara, long black hair slashed with white at the temples,
her nose only a little less bold than her husband&rsquo;s. Truth,
she could give him lessons in looking fierce, and she was very like
her daughter in one respect. Her loyalty was to her husband, not
Rand. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve taken Aes Sedai <em>prisoner</em>! Are we now to
expect the entire White Tower to descend upon our heads?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they do,&rdquo; Melaine said sharply, adjusting her
shawl, &ldquo;they will be dealt with as they deserve.&rdquo; Sun-haired,
green-eyed and beautiful, no more than a handful of years older
than Rand by her face, she was a Wise One, and married to Bael.
Whatever had caused the Wise Ones to change their view of Aes
Sedai, Melaine, Amys and Bair had changed the most.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I wish to know,&rdquo; the third woman said, &ldquo;is what
you will do about Colavaere Saighan.&rdquo; While Deira and Melaine had
presence, great presence, Dorindha outshone both, though it was
difficult to see how exactly. The roof-mistress of Smoke Springs
Hold was a solid, motherly woman, much nearer handsome than pretty,
with creases at the corners of her blue eyes and as much white in
her pale red hair as Bael had gray, yet of the three women, any eye
with a brain behind it would have said she held sway. &ldquo;Melaine says
that Bair considers Colavaere Saighan of little importance,&rdquo;
Dorindha went on, &ldquo;but Wise Ones can be as blind as any man when it
comes to seeing the battle ahead and missing the scorpion
underfoot.&rdquo; A smile for Melaine robbed the words of their sting;
Melaine&rsquo;s answering smile certainly said she took none., &ldquo;A
roofmistress&rsquo;s work is finding those scorpions before anyone
is stung.&rdquo; She also was Bael&rsquo;s wife, a fact that still
disconcerted Rand, for all it had been her choice and
Melaine&rsquo;s. Perhaps partly <em>because</em> it had been theirs;
among Aiel, a man had little say if his wife chose a sister-wife.
It was not a common arrangement even among them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Colavaere has taken up farming,&rdquo; Rand growled. They
blinked at him, wondering whether that was a joke. &ldquo;The Sun Throne
is empty again, and waiting for Elayne.&rdquo; He had considered weaving
a ward against listeners, but a ward could be detected by anyone
searching, man or woman, and its presence would announce that
something interesting was being said. Well, everything said here
would be known from the Dragonwall to the sea soon enough.</p>

<p>Fedwin was already rubbing his wrists, while Jalani
sheathed her knife. No one looked at them twice; all eyes were on
Rand. Frowning at Nerilea, he waggled his bound hands until Sulin
sliced the cords. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realize this was to be a family
gathering.&rdquo; Nerilea looked a trifle abashed, maybe, but no one else
did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After you marry,&rdquo; Davram murmured with a smile, &ldquo;you
will learn you must choose very carefully what to keep from your
wife.&rdquo; Deira glanced down at him, pursing her lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wives are a great comfort,&rdquo; Bael laughed, &ldquo;if a man
does not tell them too much.&rdquo; Smiling, Dorindha ran her fingers
into his hair&mdash;and gripped for a moment as though she meant
to tug his head off. Bael grunted, but not for Dorindha&rsquo;s
fingers alone. Melaine wiped her small belt knife on her heavy
skirt and sheathed it. The two women grinned at one another over
his head while he rubbed at his shoulder, where a small spot of
blood stained his <em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em>. Deira nodded
thoughtfully; it seemed she had just gotten an idea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What woman could I hate enough to marry her to the
Dragon Reborn?&rdquo; Rand said coldly. That caused a silence solid
enough to touch.</p>

<p>He tried to take rein on his anger. He should have
expected this. Melaine was not just a Wise One, she was a
dreamwalker, as were Amys and Bair. Among other things, they could
talk to one another in their dreams, and to others; a useful
skill, though they had only used it for him once. It was Wise
Ones&rsquo; business. No wonder at all that Melaine was abreast of
everything that had happened. No wonder that she told Dorindha
everything, Wise Ones&rsquo; business or no; the two women were best
friends and sisters rolled into one. Once Melaine let Bael know of
the kidnapping, of course he had told Bashere; expecting Bashere to
keep that from his wife was like expecting him to keep it secret
that their house was on fire. Inch by inch he drew the anger in,
forced it down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has Elayne arrived?&rdquo; He tried to make his voice
casual, and missed. No matter. There were reasons everyone knew for
him to be anxious. Andor might not be as unquiet as Cairhien, but
Elayne on the throne was the fastest way to settle both lands.
Maybe the only way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo; Bashere shrugged. &ldquo;But tales have come
north of Aes Sedai with an army somewhere in Murandy, or maybe
Altara. That could be young Mat and his Band of the Red Hand, with
the Daughter-Heir and the sisters who fled the Tower when Siuan
Sanche was deposed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand rubbed his wrists where the cords had chafed.
All that &ldquo;captive&rdquo; rigmarole had been on the chance Elayne was here
already. Elayne, and Aviendha. So he could come and go without them
learning of it till he was gone. Maybe he would have found a way to
peek at them. Maybe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He was a fool, and no maybe about
that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean those sisters to swear oath to you,
too?&rdquo; Deira&rsquo;s tone was icy as her face. She did not like him;
as she saw it, her husband had set off down a road that likely
would end with his head on a pike over a gate in Tar Valon, and
Rand had put his feet on that road. &ldquo;The White Tower will not hold
still for your coercing Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand made her a small bow, and burn her if she took
it for mocking. Deira ni Ghaline t&rsquo;Bashere never gave him a
title, never even used his name; she could as well have been
talking to a footman, and not a very intelligent or trustworthy
one. &ldquo;Should they choose to swear, I&rsquo;ll accept their oaths. I
doubt many are exactly eager to return to Tar Valon. If they choose
otherwise, they can go their own way, so long as they don&rsquo;t
put themselves against me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The White Tower has put itself against you,&rdquo; Bael
said, leaning forward with his fists on his knees. His blue eyes
made Deira&rsquo;s voice seem warm. &ldquo;An enemy who comes once, will
come again. Unless they are stopped. My spears will follow wherever
the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> leads.&rdquo; Melaine nodded, of
course; she very likely wanted every last Aes Sedai shielded and
kneeling under guard if not bound hand and foot. But Dorindha
nodded as well, and Sulin, and Bashere knuckled his mustaches
thoughtfully. Rand did not know whether to laugh or weep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I&rsquo;ve enough on my plate
without a war against the White Tower? Elaida grabbed my throat and
was slapped down.&rdquo; The ground erupting in fire and torn flesh.
Ravens and vultures gorging. How many dead? Slapped down. &ldquo;If she
has sense enough to stop there, I will too.&rdquo; So long as they did
not ask him to trust. The chest. He was shaking his head,
half-aware of Lews Therin suddenly moaning about the dark and the
thirst. He could ignore, he had to ignore, but not forget, or
trust.</p>

<p>Leaving Bael and Bashere arguing over whether Elaida
did have sense enough to stop, now that she had begun, he moved to
a map-covered table against the wall, beneath a tapestry of some
battle where the White Lion of Andor stood prominent. Apparently
Bael and Bashere used this room for their planning. A little
rooting around found the map he needed, a large roll displaying all
of Andor from the Mountains of Mist to the River Erinin, and parts
of the lands to the south as well, Ghealdan and Altara and
Murandy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The women held captive in the treekillers&rsquo;
lands are allowed to cause no trouble, so why should any others?&rdquo;
Melaine said, apparently in answer to something he had not heard.
She sounded angry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will do what we must, Deira t&rsquo;Bashere,&rdquo;
Dorindha said calmly; she was seldom anything but. &ldquo;Hold to your
courage, and we will arrive where we must go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you leap from a cliff,&rdquo; Deira replied, &ldquo;it is
too late for anything but holding to your courage. And hoping
there&rsquo;s a haywain at the bottom to land in.&rdquo; Her husband
chuckled as though she was making a joke. She did not sound it.</p>

<p>Spreading the map out and weighting the corners with
ink jars and sand bottles, Rand measured off distances with his
fingers. Mat was not moving very fast if rumor placed him in Altara
or Murandy. He took pride in how fast the Band could march. Maybe
the Aes Sedai were slowing him, with servants and wagons. Maybe
there were more sisters than he had thought. Rand realized his
hands were clenched into fists and made them straighten. He needed
Elayne. To take the throne here and in Cairhien; that was why he
needed her. Just that. Aviendha&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He did not need her, not at
all, and she had made it clear she had no need for him. She was
safe, away from him. He could keep them both safe by keeping them
as far from him as possible. Light, if he could only look at them.
He needed Mat, though, with Perrin being stubborn. He was not sure
how Mat had suddenly become expert on everything to do with battle,
but even Bashere respected Mat&rsquo;s opinions. About war,
anyway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They treated him as <em>da&rsquo;tsang</em>,&rdquo; Sulin
growled, and some of the other Maidens growled wordlessly in
echo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know,&rdquo; Melaine said grimly. &ldquo;They have no
honor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will he truly hold back after what you describe?&rdquo;
Deira demanded in disbelieving tones.</p>

<p>The map did not extend far enough south to show
Illian&mdash;no map on the table showed any part of that country&mdash;but Rand&rsquo;s hand drifted down across Murandy, and he
could imagine the Doirlon Hills, not far inside Illian&rsquo;s
borders, with a line of hillforts no invading army could afford to
ignore. And some two hundred and fifty miles to the east, across
the Plains of Maredo, an army such as had not been seen since the
nations gathered before Tar Valon in the Aiel War, maybe not since
Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s day. Tairen, Cairhienin, Aiel, all poised to
smash into Illian. If Perrin would not lead, then Mat must. Only
there was not enough time. There was never enough time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn my eyes,&rdquo; Davram muttered. &ldquo;You never mentioned
that, Melaine. Lady Caraline and Lord Toram camped right outside
the city, and High Lord Darlin as well? They didn&rsquo;t come
together by chance, now right at this time, they did not.
That&rsquo;s a pit of vipers to have on your doorstep, whoever you
are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let the <em>algai&rsquo;d&rsquo;siswai</em> dance,&rdquo;
Bael replied. &ldquo;Dead vipers bite no one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sammael had always been at his best defending. That
was Lews Therin&rsquo;s memory, from the War of the Shadow. With two
men inside one skull, maybe it was to be expected that memories
would drift between them. Had Lews Therin suddenly found himself
recalling herding sheep, or cutting firewood, or feeding the
chickens? Rand could hear him faintly, raging to kill, to destroy;
thoughts of the Forsaken almost always drove Lews Therin over the
brink.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Deira t&rsquo;Bashere speaks truly,&rdquo; Bael said. &ldquo;We
must stay on the path we have begun until our enemies are
destroyed, or we are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was not how I meant it,&rdquo; Deira said dryly. &ldquo;But
you are right. We have no choice, now. Until our enemies are
destroyed, or we are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Death, destruction and madness floated in Rand&rsquo;s
head as he studied the map. Sammael would be at those forts soon
after the army struck, Sammael with the strength of a Forsaken and
the knowledge of the Age of Legends. Lord Brend, he called himself,
one of the Council of Nine, and Lord Brend they called him who
refused to admit the Forsaken were loose, but Rand knew him. With
Lews Therin&rsquo;s memory, he knew Sammael&rsquo;s face, knew him to
the bone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does Dyelin Taravin intend with Naean Arawn and
Elenia Sarand?&rdquo; Dorindha asked. &ldquo;I confess I do not understand this
shutting people away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What she does there is hardly important,&rdquo; Davram
said. &ldquo;It is her meetings with those Aes Sedai that concern
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dyelin Taravin is a fool,&rdquo; Melaine muttered. &ldquo;She
believes the rumors about the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>
kneeling to the Amyrlin Seat. She will not brush her hair unless
those Aes Sedai give her permission.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mistake her,&rdquo; Deira said firmly. &ldquo;Dyelin is
strong enough to rule Andor; she proved that at Aringill. Of course
she listens to the Aes Sedai&mdash;only a fool ignores Aes Sedai&mdash;but to listen is not to obey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wagons that had been brought from Dumai&rsquo;s
Wells would have to be searched again. The fat-little-man <em>angreal</em> had to be there somewhere. None of the sisters who
escaped could have had a clue what it was. Unless, perhaps, one had
stuck a souvenir of the Dragon Reborn in her pouch. No. It had to
be in the wagons somewhere. With that, he was more than a match for
any of the Forsaken. Without it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Death, destruction and
madness.</p>

<p>Suddenly what he had been hearing rushed forward. &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; he demanded, turning from the ivory-inlaid
table.</p>

<p>Surprised faces turned toward him. Jonan straightened
from where he had been slouching against the doorframe. The
Maidens, squatting easily on their heels, suddenly appeared alert.
They had been talking idly among themselves; even they were wary
around him now.</p>

<p>Fingering one of her ivory necklaces, Melaine shared
a decided look between Bael and Davram, then spoke before anyone
else. &ldquo;There are nine Aes Sedai at an inn called The Silver Swan,
in what Davram Bashere calls the New City.&rdquo; She said the word &ldquo;inn&rdquo;
in an odd way, and &ldquo;city&rdquo; as well; she had only known them from
books before coming across the Dragonwall. &ldquo;He and Bael say we must
leave them alone unless they do something against you. I think you
have learned about waiting for Aes Sedai, Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My fault,&rdquo; Bashere sighed, &ldquo;if fault there is.
Though what Melaine expects to do, I can&rsquo;t say. Eight sisters
stopped at The Silver Swan almost a month ago, just after you left.
Now and then a few more come or go, but there are never more than
ten at one time. They keep to themselves, cause no trouble, and ask
no questions that Bael or I can learn. A few Red sisters have come
into the city, as well; twice. Those at The Silver Swan all have
Warders, but these never do. I&rsquo;m sure they are Reds. Two or
three appear, ask after men heading for the Black Tower, and after
a day or so, they leave. Without learning much, I&rsquo;d say. That
Black Tower is as good as a fortress for holding in secrets. None
of them has made trouble, and I would rather not trouble them until
I know it is necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; Rand said slowly. He sat
down in a chair opposite Bashere, gripping the carved arms till his
knuckles hurt. Aes Sedai gathering here, Aes Sedai gathering in
Cairhien. Happenstance? Lews Therin rumbled like thunder on the
horizon about death and betrayal. He would have to warn Taim. Not
about the Aes Sedai at The Silver Swan&mdash;Taim certainly knew
already; why had he not mentioned it?&mdash;about staying away
from them, keeping the Asha&rsquo;man away. If Dumai&rsquo;s Wells
was to be an end, there could be no new beginnings here. Too many
things seemed to be spinning out of control. The harder he tried to
gather them all in, the more there were and the faster they spun.
Sooner or later, everything was going to fall, and shatter. The
thought dried his throat. Thom Merrilin had taught him to juggle a
little, but he had never been very good. Now he had to be very good
indeed. He wished he had something to wet his throat.</p>

<p>He did not realize he had spoken that last aloud
until Jalani straightened from her crouch and strutted across the
room to where a tall silver pitcher stood on a small table. Filling
a hammered silver goblet, she brought it back to Rand with a smile,
her mouth opening as she proffered it. He expected something rude,
but a change came over her face. All she said was, &ldquo;<em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>,&rdquo; then went back to her place with
the other Maidens, so dignified it seemed she was imitating
Dorindha, or maybe Deira. Somara gestured in handtalk, and suddenly
every Maiden was red-faced and biting her lips to keep from
laughing. Every Maiden but Jalani, who was just red-faced.</p>

<p>The wine punch tasted of plums. Rand could remember
fat sweet plums from the orchards across the river when he was
young, climbing the trees to pick them himself&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Tilting his
head back, he drained the goblet. There were plum trees in the Two
Rivers, but no orchards of them, and certainly not across any
river. <em>Keep your bloody memories to yourself</em>, he snarled
at Lews Therin. The man in his head laughed at something, giggling
quietly to himself.</p>

<p>Bashere frowned at the Maidens, then glanced at Bael
and his wives, all impassive as stone, and shook his head. He got
on well with Bael, but Aiel in general mystified him. &ldquo;Since no one
is bringing me any drink,&rdquo; he said, rising, and went to pour his
own. He took a long swallow that wet his heavy mustaches. &ldquo;Now,
that&rsquo;s cooling. Taim&rsquo;s way of enrolling men seems to
sweep up every fellow who&rsquo;d like to follow the Dragon Reborn.
He has delivered a goodly army to me, men who lack whatever it is
your Asha&rsquo;man need. They all talk wide-eyed about walking
though holes in the air, but none has been anywhere near the Black
Tower. I&rsquo;m trying out a few thoughts young Mat had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand waved that away with the empty goblet. &ldquo;Tell me
about Dyelin.&rdquo; Dyelin of House Taravin would be next in line for
the throne should anything happen to Elayne, but he had told her he
was having Elayne brought to Caemlyn. &ldquo;If she thinks she can take
the Lion Throne, I can find a farm for her, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take the throne?&rdquo; Deira said incredulously, and her
husband laughed out loud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no understanding of wetlander ways,&rdquo; Bael
said, &ldquo;but I do not think that is what she has done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Far from it.&rdquo; Davram carried the pitcher over to
pour more punch for Rand. &ldquo;Some lesser lords and ladies who thought
to curry favor proclaimed for her at Aringill. She moves quickly,
Lady Dyelin. Within four days she had the two leaders hanged, for
treason to the Daughter-Heir Elayne, and ordered another twenty
flogged.&rdquo; He chuckled approvingly. His wife sniffed. Likely she
would have had the road lined with gibbets all the way from
Aringill to Caemlyn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what was that about her ruling Andor?&rdquo; Rand
demanded. &ldquo;And imprisoning Elenia and Naean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are the ones who tried to claim the throne,&rdquo;
Deira said, dark eyes sparkling angrily.</p>

<p>Bashere nodded. He was much calmer. &ldquo;Only three days
ago. When word arrived of Colavaere&rsquo;s coronation, and the
rumors from Cairhien that you had gone to Tar Valon began to sound
more real. With trade beginning again, there are so many pigeons in
the air between Cairhien and Caemlyn, you could walk on their
backs.&rdquo; Putting the pitcher back, he returned to his chair. &ldquo;Naean
proclaimed for the Lion Throne in the morning, Elenia before
midday, and by sunset Dyelin, Pelivar and Luan had arrested them
both. They announced Dyelin as Regent the next morning. In
Elayne&rsquo;s name, until Elayne returns. Most of the Houses of
Andor have declared support for Dyelin. I think some would like her
to take the throne herself, but Aringill keeps even the most
powerful careful of their tongues.&rdquo; Closing one eye, Bashere
pointed at Rand. &ldquo;You, they do not mention at all. Whether that is
good or bad, it will take a wiser head than mine to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Deira offered a cool smile, looking down that nose of
hers. &ldquo;Those&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;lickspittles&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;you allowed to make free of
the palace have all fled the city, it seems. Fled Andor, some of
them, according to rumor. You should know, they were all behind
either Elenia or Naean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand carefully set his full goblet on the floor
beside his chair. He had only let Lir and Arymilla and the rest
remain in order to try pushing Dyelin and those who supported her
into cooperation with him. They would never have left Andor to the
likes of Lord Lir. With time and Elayne&rsquo;s return, it might yet
work. But everything was whirling faster and faster, whirling away
from his fingers. There were a few things he could control,
though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fedwin, there, is an Asha&rsquo;man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He
can bring messages to me in Cairhien, if there&rsquo;s need.&rdquo; That
with a glare for Melaine, who returned the blandest sort of look.
Deira studied Fedwin as she might a dead rat some overeager dog had
dropped on her rug. Davram and Bael were more considering; Fedwin
tried to stand straighter under their gaze. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let anyone
know who he is,&rdquo; Rand went on. &ldquo;No one. That&rsquo;s why he
isn&rsquo;t wearing black. I am taking two more to Lord Semaradrid
and High Lord Weiramon tonight. They&rsquo;ll have need when they
face Sammael in the Doirlon Hills. I will be busy chewing on
Cairhien for a while yet, it seems.&rdquo; And maybe Andor, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does this mean you will send the spears forward at
last?&rdquo; Bael said. &ldquo;You give the orders tonight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand nodded, and Bashere gave a great hoot of
laughter. &ldquo;Now, that calls for a good wine. Or it would if it
wasn&rsquo;t hot enough to make a man&rsquo;s blood thick as
porridge.&rdquo; Laughter slid into a grimace. &ldquo;Burn me, but I wish I
could be there. Still, I suppose holding Caemlyn for the Dragon
Reborn is no small thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You always want to be where the swords are bared, my
husband.&rdquo; Deira sounded quite fond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fifth,&rdquo; Bael said. &ldquo;You will allow the fifth in
Illian, when Sammael has fallen?&rdquo; Aiel custom allowed taking the
fifth part of all that was in a place taken by force of arms. Rand
had forbidden it here in Caemlyn; he would not give Elayne a city
looted even that much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will have the fifth,&rdquo; Rand said, but it was not
of Sammael or Illian that he thought. <em>Bring Elayne quickly,
Mat</em>. It ran wild in his head, across Lews Therin&rsquo;s
cackling. <em>Bring her quickly, before Andor and Cairhien both
erupt in my face</em>.</p>
