followed closely as she dared on
Cadsuane&rsquo;s heels, a hundred questions bubbling on her tongue,
but Cadsuane was not a woman whose sleeve you plucked. She decided
who she noticed, and when. Annoura held her silence, too, the pair
of them drawn along in the other&rsquo;s wake down the palace
corridors, down flights of stairs, polished marble at first, then
plain dark stone. Merana exchanged glances with her sister Gray,
and felt a moment&rsquo;s pang. She did not know the woman, really,
but Annoura wore the steely look of a girl on her way to the
Mistress of Novices, determined to be brave. They were not novices.
They were not children. She opened her mouth&mdash;and closed it,
intimidated by the gray bun bobbing ahead of her with its dangling
moons and stars and birds and fish. Cadsuane was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Cadsuane.</p>

<p>Merana had met her once before, or at least listened
to her and been spoken to, when she was a novice. Sisters had come
from every Ajah to see the woman, filled with an awe they could not
hide. Once Cadsuane Melaidhrin had been the standard by which every
new entry into the novice books was judged. Until Elayne Trakand,
none had come to the White Tower in her lifetime who could match
that standard, much less surpass it. In more ways than one, her
like had not walked among Aes Sedai for a thousand years. A refusal
to accept selection as a Sitter was unheard of, yet it was said she
had refused, and at least twice. It was said she had spurned being
raised head of the Green Ajah, too. It was said she once vanished
from the Tower for ten years because the Hall intended to raise her
Amyrlin. Not that she had ever spent a day more in Tar Valon than
absolutely necessary. Word of Cadsuane came to the Tower, stories
to make sisters gape, adventures to make those who dreamed of the
shawl shiver. She would end a legend among Aes Sedai. If she was
not already.</p>

<p>The shawl had graced Merana&rsquo;s shoulders for over
twenty-five years when Cadsuane announced her retirement from the
world, her hair already solid gray, and everyone assumed her long
dead when the Aiel War erupted another twenty-five years on, but
before the fighting was three months old, she reappeared,
accompanied by two Warders, men long in the tooth yet still hard as
iron. It was said Cadsuane had had more Warders over the years than
most sisters had shoes. After the Aiel retreated from Tar Valon,
she retired once more, but some said, more than half-seriously,
that Cadsuane would never die so long as even a spark of adventure
remained in the world.</p>

<p><em>And that is the sort of nonsense that novices
babbl</em>e, Merana reminded herself firmly. <em>Even we die
eventually</em>. Yet Cadsuane was still Cadsuane. And if she was
not one of those sisters who had appeared in the city after
al&rsquo;Thor was taken, the sun would not set tonight. Merana moved
her arms to adjust her shawl and realized it was hanging on a peg
in her room. Ridiculous. She needed no reminders of who she was. If
only it had been someone other than Cadsuane&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A pair of Wise Ones standing in the mouth of a
crossing corridor watched them pass, cold pale eyes in stony faces
beneath their dark head scarves. Edarra and Leyn. Both could
channel, and quite strongly; they might have risen high had they
gone to the Tower as girls. Cadsuane went by without seeming to
notice the wilders&rsquo; disapprobation. Annoura did, frowning and
muttering, slender braids swaying as she shook her head. Merana
kept her own eyes on the floor tiles.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly it would fall to her now, explaining to
Cadsuane the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;compromise&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that had been worked out with
the Wise Ones last night, before she and the others were brought to
the palace. Annoura did not know&mdash;she was no part of it&mdash;and Merana had small hope that Rafela or Verin would appear,
or anyone else she might somehow foist the duty onto. It was a
compromise, in a way, and perhaps the best that could be expected
under the circumstances, yet she strongly questioned whether
Cadsuane would see it so. She wished she did not have to be the one
to convince her. Better to pour tea for those cursed men for a
month. She wished she had not been so free with her tongue with
young al&rsquo;Thor. Knowing why he had made her serve tea was no
balm for being sealed off from every advantage she might have
gained from it. She would rather think she had been caught in some
<em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> swirling of the Pattern than believe that a
young man&rsquo;s eyes, like polished blue-gray gems, had set her
babbling from pure fright, but either way, she had handed all the
advantage to him on a tray. She wished&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wishing was for children. She had negotiated
countless treaties, many of which had actually accomplished what
was intended; she had ended three wars and stopped two dozen more
before they began, faced kings and queens and generals and made
them see reason. Even so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She found herself promising that she
would not utter one word of complaint no matter how often that man
made her play the maidservant if only Seonid would pop around the
next corner, or Masuri, or Faeldrin, or anyone at all. Light! If
only she could blink her eyes and find that everything since
leaving Salidar had been a bad dream.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, Cadsuane led them straight to the small
room that Bera and Kiruna shared, deep in the bowels of the palace.
Where the servants lived. A tight window, set high in the wall yet
level with the paving stones of a courtyard outside, let in a
little stream of light, but the room seemed murky. Cloaks and
saddlebags and a few dresses hung from pegs in the cracked,
yellowing plaster walls. Gouges marred the bare wooden floor,
though some effort had been made to smooth them. A tiny battered
round table stood in one corner, and an equally beaten washstand in
another, with a chipped basin and pitcher. Merana eyed the small
bed. It did not look that much narrower than the one she was forced
to share with Seonid and Masuri, two doors farther down. That room
was larger by perhaps a pace each way, but not meant for three.
Coiren and the others still held in the Aiel tents probably were
much more comfortable as prisoners.</p>

<p>Neither Bera nor Kiruna was present, but Daigian was,
a plump, pale woman who wore a thin silver chain in her long black
hair, with a round moonstone dangling in the middle of her
forehead. Her dark Cairhienin dress bore four thin stripes of color
across the bodice, and she had added slashes in the skirts, white
for her Ajah. A younger daughter of one of the lesser Houses, she
had always minded Merana of a pouter pigeon. When Cadsuane entered,
Daigian rose on her toes expectantly.</p>

<p>There was only one chair in the room, little more
than a stool with an excuse of a back. Cadsuane took that and
sighed. &ldquo;Tea, please. Two sips of what that boy poured, and I could
have used my tongue to sole a shoe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The glow of <em>saidar</em> immediately surrounded
Daigian, though faintly, and a dented tin teapot rose from the
table, flows of Fire heating the water as she opened a small
brass-bound tea chest.</p>

<p>With no other choice for place to sit, Merana settled
onto the bed, adjusting her skirts and shifting on the lumpy
mattress while she tried to order her thoughts. This might well be
as important a negotiation as she had ever undertaken. After a
moment, Annoura joined her, perching on the lip of the
mattress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I take it by your presence, Merana,&rdquo; Cadsuane said
abruptly, &ldquo;that tales of the boy submitting to Elaida are false.
Don&rsquo;t look so surprised, child. Did you think I didn&rsquo;t
know your&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;associations?&rdquo; She gave that word such a twist, it
sounded as filthy as any soldier&rsquo;s expletive. &ldquo;And you,
Annoura?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am here only to advise Berelain, though the truth
of it is, she ignored my advice by coming in the first place.&rdquo; The
Taraboner woman held her head up, voice confident. She was rubbing
her thumbs for all she was worth, though. She could not do well at
the negotiating table if she was that transparent. &ldquo;For the rest,&rdquo;
she said carefully, &ldquo;I have reached no decision as yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A <em>wise</em> decision, that,&rdquo; Cadsuane murmured,
with a pointed look at Merana. &ldquo;It seems that in the last few years
far too many sisters have forgotten they possess brains, or
discretion. There was a time when Aes Sedai reached their decisions
after calm deliberation, with the good of the Tower always in the
front of their thoughts. Just remember what the Sanche girl got
from meddling with al&rsquo;Thor, Annoura. Walk too near a
forge-fire, and you can be burned badly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Merana lifted her chin, working her neck to ease its
tightness. Realizing what she was doing, she made herself stop. The
woman did not stand that far above her. Not really. Just higher
than any other sister. &ldquo;If I may ask&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Too diffident, but
worse to stop and start over. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;what are your intentions,
Cadsuane?&rdquo; She struggled to maintain dignity. &ldquo;Obviously, you have
been&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;holding yourself aside&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;until now. Why have you
decided to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;approach&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;al&rsquo;Thor at this particular
time? You were&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;rather undiplomatic&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might as well have slapped his face,&rdquo; Annoura
put in, and Merana colored. Of the two of them, Annoura should have
been having the harder time with Cadsuane by far, but she was not
the one stumbling over her words.</p>

<p>Cadsuane shook her head in pitying style. &ldquo;If you
want to see what a man is made of, push him from a direction he
doesn&rsquo;t expect. There&rsquo;s good metal in that boy, I think,
but he&rsquo;s going to be difficult.&rdquo; Steepling her fingers, she
peered across them at the wall, musing to herself. &ldquo;He has a rage
in him fit to burn the world, and he holds it by a hair. Push him
too far off balance&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Phaw! Al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s not so hard yet
as Logain Ablar or Mazrim Taim, but a hundred times as difficult, I
fear.&rdquo; Hearing those three names together clove Merana&rsquo;s
tongue to the roof of her mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have seen Logain and Taim both?&rdquo; a staring
Annoura said. &ldquo;Taim, he is following al&rsquo;Thor, so I hear.&rdquo;
Merana managed to swallow a relieved sigh. Tales of Dumai&rsquo;s
Wells had not had time to spread yet. They would, though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do have ears to catch rumors, too, Annoura,&rdquo;
Cadsuane said acerbically. &ldquo;Though I could wish I didn&rsquo;t, for
what I hear of that pair. All my work thrown away to be done over.
Others&rsquo; as well, but I did my share. And then there are these
blackcoats, these Asha&rsquo;man.&rdquo; Taking a cup from Daigian, she
smiled warmly and murmured thanks. The round-cheeked White seemed
ready to curtsy, though all she did was retreat to a corner and
fold her hands. She had been longer a novice, and Accepted, than
anyone in living memory, barely allowed to remain in the Tower,
gaining the ring by a fingernail and the shawl by an eyelash.
Daigian was always self-effacing around other sisters.</p>

<p>Breathing the steam from her teacup, Cadsuane went
on, suddenly chatting pleasantly. &ldquo;It was Logain, practically on my
doorstep, that lured me away from my roses. Phaw! A scuffle at a
sheep fair could have lured me from those Light-cursed plants.
What&rsquo;s the point if you use the Power, but do it without, and
you grow ten thousand thorns for every&mdash;Phaw! I actually
considered taking the oath as a Hunter, if the Council of Nine
would allow it. Well. It was a nice few months, chasing down
Logain, but once he was taken, escorting him to Tar Valon appealed
as much as the roses. I wandered a bit, to see what I could find,
perhaps a new Warder, though it&rsquo;s a bit late for that in any
fairness to the man, I suppose. Then I heard of Taim, and I was off
to Saldaea as fast I could ride. There&rsquo;s nothing for a bit of
excitement like a man who can channel.&rdquo; Abruptly her voice
hardened, and her gaze. &ldquo;Were either of you involved in that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;vileness&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;right after the Aiel War?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite herself, Merana gave a confused start. The
other woman&rsquo;s eyes spoke of the block and the headsman&rsquo;s
axe. &ldquo;What vileness? I don&rsquo;t know what you are talking
about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That accusing glare hit Annoura so hard, she almost
fell off the bed. &ldquo;The Aiel War?&rdquo; she gasped, steadying herself. &ldquo;The years after, I spent trying to make the so-called Grand
Coalition more than a name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Merana looked at Annoura with interest. A good many
of the Gray Ajah had scurried from capital to capital after, the
war, in a futile effort to hold together the alliance that had
formed against the Aiel, but she had never known Annoura was one of
them. She could not be that bad a negotiator if she was. &ldquo;So did
I,&rdquo; she said. Dignity. Since setting out after al&rsquo;Thor from
Caemlyn, she had not retained much of that. The few scraps
remaining were too precious to lose. She made her voice calm, and
firm. &ldquo;What vileness do you mean, Cadsuane?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gray-haired woman simply waved the question away,
as though she had never spoken the word.</p>

<p>For a moment, Merana wondered whether Cadsuane&rsquo;s
wits might be wandering. She had never heard of it happening to a
sister, but most Aes Sedai did go into retreat at the close of
their lives, far from the stratagems and turbulence that none but
sisters ever knew. Far from everyone, often as not. Who could say
what befell them before the end? One look at the clear, steady gaze
regarding her over that teacup quickly disabused her of any such
notion. Anyway, twenty-year-old vileness, whatever it had been,
certainly could not hold a candle to what the world confronted now.
And Cadsuane still had not answered her original questions. What
did she intend? And why now?</p>

<p>Before Merana could ask again, the door opened and
Bera and Kiruna were herded in by Corele Hovian, a boyishly slim
Yellow with thick black eyebrows and a mass of raven hair that gave
her something of a wild appearance no matter how neatly she
dressed, and she always dressed for a country dance, with masses of
embroidery on her sleeves and bodice and up the sides of her
skirts. There was barely room to move, with so many people in this
confined space. Corele never failed to seem amused, whatever
happened, but now she wore a wide smile somewhere between disbelief
and outright laughter. Kiruna&rsquo;s eyes flashed in a face of
frozen arrogance, while Bera fumed, mouth tight and forehead
creased. Until they saw Cadsuane. Merana supposed that for them, it
must be as if she had found herself face to face with Alind Dyfelle
or Sevlana Meseau or even Mabriam en Shereed. Their eyes bulged.
Kiruna&rsquo;s jaw dropped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you were dead,&rdquo; Bera breathed.</p>

<p>Cadsuane sniffed irritably. &ldquo;I am growing tired of
hearing that. The next imbecile I hear it from is going to yelp for
a week.&rdquo; Annoura began studying the toes of her slippers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never guess where I found these two,&rdquo;
Corele said in her lilting Murandian accent. She tapped the side of
her upturned nose, the way she did when about to tell a joke, or
what she saw as one. Spots of color appeared in Bera&rsquo;s cheeks,
and larger in Kiruna&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Bera there was sitting meek as a
mouse under the eyes of half a dozen of those Aiel wilders, who
told me bold as you please that she couldn&rsquo;t come with me
until Sorilea&mdash;oh, now that woman&rsquo;s a harridan to give
you nightmares, she is&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t have Bera until
Sorilea was done with her private chat with the other apprentice.
Our darling Kiruna, there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was no longer a matter of spots. Kiruna and Bera
reddened to their hair, refusing to meet anyone&rsquo;s eye. Even
Daigian stared at them.</p>

<p>Relief surged through Merana in wonderful waves. She
would not have to be the one to explain how the Wise Ones had
interpreted that wretched al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s orders that the
sisters were to obey them. They were not really apprentices; there
were no lessons involved, of course. What could a great lot of
wilders, savages at that, teach Aes Sedai? It was just that the
Wise Ones liked to know where everyone fit. Just? Bera or Kiruna
could tell how al&rsquo;Thor had laughed&mdash;laughed!&mdash;and
said it made no difference to him and he expected them to be <em>obedient</em> pupils. No one was having an easy time bending her
neck, least of all Kiruna.</p>

<p>Yet Cadsuane did not demand explanations. &ldquo;I expected
a dog&rsquo;s dinner,&rdquo; she said dryly, &ldquo;but not a bucket from the
midden. Let me see if I have the straight of it. You children who
stand in rebellion against a lawfully raised Amyrlin have now
somehow associated yourselves with the al&rsquo;Thor boy, and if you
are taking orders from these Aiel women, I assume you take his as
well.&rdquo; Her grunt was disgusted enough for a mouthful of rotten
plums. Shaking her head, she peered into her teacup, then fixed the
pair again. &ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s one treason more or less? The Hall
can put you on your knees from here to Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don for
penance, but they can only take your heads once. What of the rest,
out in the Aiel camp? All Elaida&rsquo;s, I suppose. Have they also&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>apprenticed</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;themselves? None of us have been
allowed as close as the first row of tents. These Aiel seem to have
no love of Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know, Cadsuane,&rdquo; Kiruna answered, so
red-faced she appeared about to catch fire. &ldquo;We have been kept
apart.&rdquo; Merana&rsquo;s eyes widened. She had never before heard
Kiruna sound deferential.</p>

<p>Bera, on the other hand, drew a deep breath. She
already stood straight, yet she seemed to straighten herself for an
unpleasant task. &ldquo;Elaida is not&mdash;&rdquo; she began heatedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elaida is overambitious, as near as I can make out,&rdquo;
Cadsuane broke in, leaning forward so abruptly that Merana and
Annoura both started back on the bed, though she was not looking at
them, &ldquo;and she may be a catastrophe simmering, but she is still the
Amyrlin Seat, raised by the Hall of the Tower in full accordance
with the laws of the Tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Elaida is a lawful Amyrlin, why have you not
obeyed her order to return?&rdquo; All that betrayed Bera&rsquo;s lack of
composure was the stillness of her hands on her skirts. Only a
marked effort to keep from clutching or smoothing could hold them
so motionless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So one of you has a little backbone.&rdquo; Cadsuane
laughed softly, but her eyes did not look mirthful at all. Leaning
back, she sipped her tea. &ldquo;Now sit down. I have a great many more
questions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Merana and Annoura rose, offering their places on the
bed, but Kiruna simply stood peering at Cadsuane worriedly, and
Bera glanced at her friend, then shook her head. Corele rolled her
blue eyes, grinning broadly for some reason, but Cadsuane did not
seem to care.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Half the rumors I hear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;concern the
Forsaken being loose. It would hardly be a surprise, with all else,
but do you have any evidence, for or against?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before very long, Merana was glad to be sitting;
before very long, she knew what laundry felt going through the
laundress&rsquo;s mangle. Cadsuane did all the questioning, dodging
from topic to topic so you never knew what was coming next. Corele
held her peace except for chuckling now and then or shaking her
head, and Daigian did not even do that, of course. Merana caught
the worst, her and Bera and Kiruna, yet Annoura was certainly not
spared. Every time Berelain&rsquo;s advisor relaxed, thinking she
was in the clear, Cadsuane skewered her anew.</p>

<p>The woman wanted to know everything, from the
al&rsquo;Thor boy&rsquo;s authority with the Aiel to why a Sea Folk
Wavemistress was anchored in the river, from whether Moiraine truly
was dead to whether the boy really had rediscovered Traveling and
whether Berelain had bedded him or had any intention of it. What
Cadsuane thought of the answers was impossible to say, except once,
when she learned that Alanna had bonded al&rsquo;Thor, and how. Her
mouth compressed to a thin line and she frowned a hole though the
wall, but while everyone else expressed disgust, Merana thought of
Cadsuane saying she had considered taking another Warder
herself.</p>

<p>The answer was ignorance entirely too often to suit,
but saying you did not know failed to quench Cadsuane&rsquo;s
appetite; she required every last shred and particle you did know,
even if you did not know you knew it. They managed to keep a little
back, most of what had to be kept back, yet a few surprising things
came out that way, some very surprising, even from Annoura, who, it
turned out, had been receiving detailed letters from Berelain
almost from the day the girl rode north. Cadsuane demanded answers,
but gave none, and that worried Merana. She watched faces grow
dogged and defensive and apologetic, and wondered whether her own
looked the same.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cadsuane.&rdquo; She had to make one more effort. &ldquo;Cadsuane, why have you decided to take an interest in him now?&rdquo; An
unblinking gaze met hers for a moment, then Cadsuane turned her
attention to Bera and Kiruna.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So they actually managed to kidnap him right out of
the palace,&rdquo; the gray-haired woman said, holding out her empty cup
for Daigian to refill. No one else had been offered tea.
Cadsuane&rsquo;s expression and tone were so neutral that Merana
wanted to tear her own hair. Al&rsquo;Thor would not be pleased if
he learned Kiruna had revealed the kidnapping, however
inadvertently; Cadsuane used any slip of your tongue to pry out
more than you meant to say. At least the details of his treatment
had not come out. He had made plain how displeased he would be if
that happened. Merana thanked the Light that the woman was not
staying with any one subject for long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are sure it was Taim? And you are sure these
blackcoats didn&rsquo;t arrive on horses?&rdquo; Bera answered
reluctantly, and Kiruna sullenly; they were as certain as they
could be; no one had actually seen the Asha&rsquo;man come or
depart, and the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;hole&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that brought them all here could
have been made by al&rsquo;Thor. Which did not satisfy at all, of
course.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think! You aren&rsquo;t silly girls any longer, or
shouldn&rsquo;t be. Phaw! You must have noticed something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Merana felt ill. She and the others had spent half
the night arguing over what their oath meant before deciding it
meant exactly what they had said, with no loopholes to wriggle
through. At last even Kiruna conceded that they must defend and
support al&rsquo;Thor as well as obey, that standing aside in the
slightest was not permitted. What that might mean when it came to
Elaida and the sisters loyal to her really concerned no one. At
least, no one admitted any concern. The mere fact of what they had
decided was stunner enough. But Merana wondered whether Bera or
Kiruna had yet realized what she had. They might just find
themselves opposing a legend, not to mention whatever sisters
besides Corele and Daigian had chosen to follow her. Worse&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Cadsuane&rsquo;s eyes rested on her for a moment, giving away
nothing, demanding everything. Worse, Merana was sure that Cadsuane
knew that very well.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Hurrying along the palace corridors, Min ignored
greetings from half a dozen Maidens she knew, just trotted right by
without a word in return, never considering that she was being
rude. Trotting was not easy in heeled boots. The fool things women
did for men! Not that Rand had asked her to wear the boots, but she
put them on the first time with him in mind, and she had seen him
smile. He liked them. Light, what was she doing, thinking about
boots! She should never have gone to Colavaere&rsquo;s apartments.
Shivering, blinking back unshed tears, she began to run.</p>

<p>As usual, a number of Maidens were squatting on their
Heels beside the tall doors worked with gilded rising suns. Their
<em>shoufa</em> hung about their shoulders and their spears lay
across their knees, yet there was nothing casual about them. They
were leopards, waiting for something to kill. Usually Maidens made
Min uneasy, for all they were friendly enough. Today, she would not
have cared if they were veiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is in a foul temper,&rdquo; Riallin warned, but made no
move to stop her. Min was one of the few allowed to enter
Rand&rsquo;s presence without being announced. She straightened her
coat and tried to settle herself. She was not sure why she had
come. Except that Rand made her feel safe. Burn him! She had never
needed anyone to feel safe before.</p>

<p>Just inside the room, she stopped, aghast.
Automatically, she pushed the door shut behind her. The place was a
shambles. A few glittering shards clung to some of the mirror
frames, but most of the glass lay scattered across the floor. The
dais was on its side, the throne that had stood atop it just gilded
flinders where it had been smashed against a wall. One of the
stand-lamps, heavy iron beneath the gilt, had been twisted into a
hoop. Rand sat in one of the smaller chairs in his shirtsleeves,
arms dangling and head back, staring at the ceiling. Staring at
nothing. Images danced about him and colored auras flickered and
flared; he was like Aes Sedai in that. She had no need of
Illuminators when Rand or an Aes Sedai was in sight. He did not
move as she walked farther into the room. He did not seem aware of
her at all. Shattered bits of mirror crunched beneath her boots. A
foul temper, indeed.</p>

<p>Even so, she felt no fear. Not of him; she could not
begin to imagine Rand harming her. For him, she felt enough to
nearly purge the memory of Colavaere&rsquo;s apartments from her
head. She had long since reconciled herself to being hopelessly in
love. Nothing else mattered, not that he was an unsophisticated
countryman, younger than she, not who or what he was, not that he
was doomed to go mad and die if he was not killed first. <em>I
don&rsquo;t even mind having to share him</em>, she thought, and
knew how tightly she was caught if she could lie to herself. That,
she had forced herself to accept; Elayne had a part of him, a claim
on him, and so did this Aviendha woman she had yet to meet. What
could not be mended must be lived with, so her Aunt Jan always
said. Especially when your brains had gone soft. Light, she had
always prided herself on keeping her wits.</p>

<p>She stopped beside one of the chairs, where the
Dragon Scepter had driven into the thick wooden back so hard that
the point stood out nearly a hand behind. In love with a man who
did not know, who would send her away should he ever became aware.
A man she was sure was in love with her. And with Elayne, and this
Aviendha, too; that, she rushed by. What could not be mended&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He was in love with her and refused to admit it. Did he think that
just because mad Lews Therin Telamon had killed the woman he loved,
he was fated to as well?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you came,&rdquo; he said suddenly, still
staring at the ceiling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been sitting here alone. Alone.&rdquo;
He gave a bitter bark of a laugh. &ldquo;Herid Fel is dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;not that sweet little old man.&rdquo;
Her eyes stung.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was torn apart.&rdquo; Rand&rsquo;s voice was so tired.
So empty. &ldquo;Idrien fainted when she found him. She lay in a stupor
half the night, and was nearly incoherent when finally roused. One
of the other women at the school gave her something to make her
sleep. She was embarrassed about that. When she came to me, she
started crying again and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;It had to be Shadowspawn. What else
could tear a man limb from limb?&rdquo; Without raising his head, he
smacked a fist down on the chair arm so hard the wood creaked. &ldquo;But
why? Why was he killed? What could he have told me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min tried to think. She truly did. Master Fel was a
philosopher; he and Rand discussed everything from the meaning of
parts of the Prophecies of the Dragon to the nature of the hole
into the Dark One&rsquo;s prison. He let her borrow books,
fascinating books, especially where she had to work to puzzle out
what it was they said. He had been a philosopher. He would never
lend her a book again. Such a gentle old man, wrapped up in a world
of thought and startled when he noticed anything outside it. She
treasured a note he had written to Rand. He had said she was
pretty, that she distracted him. And now he was dead. Light, she
had had too much of death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have told you, not like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave a start; she had not heard Rand cross the
room. His fingers brushed her cheek. Wiping away tears. She was
crying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Min,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;I am not a
very nice person anymore. A man is dead because of me, and all I
can do is worry why he was killed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flinging arms around him, she buried her face against
his chest. She could not stop crying. She could not stop trembling. &ldquo;I went to Colavaere&rsquo;s apartments.&rdquo; Images flashed in her
head. The empty sitting room, all the servants gone. The
bedchamber. She did not want to remember, but now she had begun,
she could not stop the words tumbling out. &ldquo;I thought, since
you&rsquo;d exiled her, maybe there was some way around the viewing
I had of her.&rdquo; Colavaere had been wearing what must have been her
finest gown, dark silk that glistened, with falls of delicate
aged-ivory Sovarra lace. &ldquo;I thought for once it didn&rsquo;t have to
be that way. You&rsquo;re <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>. You can change the
Pattern.&rdquo; Colavaere had donned a necklace and bracelets of emeralds
and firedrops, and rings with pearls and rubies, surely her best
pieces, and yellow diamonds had been arranged in her hair, a fair
imitation of the crown of Cairhien. Her face&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;She was in her
bedchamber. Hanging from one of the bedposts.&rdquo; Bulging eyes and
protruding tongue in a blackened, swollen face. Toes a foot above
the overturned stool. Sobbing helplessly, Min sagged against
him.</p>

<p>His arms went around her slowly, gently. &ldquo;Oh, Min,
you have more pain than pleasure from your gift. If I could take
your pain, I would, Min. I would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slowly it penetrated that he was trembling, too.
Light, he tried so hard to be iron, to be what he thought the
Dragon Reborn must, but it cut him when somebody died because of
him, Colavaere probably no less than Fel. He bled for everyone
harmed, and tried to pretend he did not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kiss me,&rdquo; she mumbled. When he did not move, she
looked up. He blinked at her uncertainly, eyes now blue, now gray,
a morning sky. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not teasing.&rdquo; How often had she teased
him, sitting on his lap, kissing him, calling him sheepherder
because she dared not say his name for fear he might hear the
caress? He put up with it because he thought she was teasing and
would stop if she believed it did not affect him. Hah! Aunt Jan and
Aunt Rana said you should not kiss a man unless you intended to
marry him, but Aunt Miren seemed to know a little more of the
world. She said you should not kiss a man too casually because men
fell in love so easily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m cold inside, sheepherder.
Colavaere, and Master Fel&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I need to feel warm flesh. I need&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Please?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His head lowered so slowly. It was a brother&rsquo;s
kiss, at first, mild as milk-water, soothing, comforting. Then it
became something else. Not at all soothing. Jerking upright, he
tried to pull away. &ldquo;Min, I can&rsquo;t. I have no right&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seizing two handfuls of his hair, she pulled his
mouth back down, and after a little while, he stopped fighting. She
was not certain whether her hands began tearing at the laces of his
shirt first or his at hers, but of one thing she was absolutely
sure. If he even tried to stop now, she was going to fetch one of
Riallin&rsquo;s spears, all of them, and stab him.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">On her way out of the Sun Palace, Cadsuane studied
the Aiel wilders she saw as well as she could without being
obvious. Corele and Daigian followed in silence; they knew her well
enough by now not to disturb her with chatter, which could not be
said of all those who paused a few days at Arilyn&rsquo;s little
palace before she sent them on. A great many wilders, every one
staring at the Aes Sedai as if at flea-ridden curs covered with
running sores, tracking mud over a new rug. Some people looked at
Aes Sedai with awe or adoration, others with fear or hate, but
Cadsuane had never seen contempt before, not even from Whitecloaks.
Even so, any people who produced so many wilders should be sending
a river of girls to the Tower.</p>

<p>That would have to be seen to eventually, and to the
Pit of Doom with custom if need be, but not now. The al&rsquo;Thor
boy needed to be kept intrigued enough that he allowed her near
him, and off-balance enough that she could nudge him where she
wanted without him realizing. One way or another, anything that
might interfere with that must be controlled or suppressed. Nothing
could be allowed to influence him, or upset him, in the wrong way.
Nothing.</p>

<p>The shiny black coach was waiting in the courtyard
behind a patient team of six matched grays. A serving man rushed to
open the door painted with a pair of silver stars atop red and
green stripes, bowing to the three of them till his bald head was
nearly level with his knees. He was in shirtsleeves and breeches.
Since coming to the Sun Palace, she had not noticed anyone in
livery yet, except a few wearing Dobraine&rsquo;s colors. No doubt
the servants were unsure what to wear and afraid to make a
mistake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may skin Elaida when I can lay hands on her,&rdquo; she
said as the coach lurched into motion. &ldquo;That fool child has made my
task nearly impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then she laughed so abruptly that Daigian stared
before she could control her eyes. Corele&rsquo;s smile widened in
anticipation. Neither understood, and she did not try to explain.
All of her life, the fastest way to interest her in anything had
been to tell her it was impossible. But then, over two hundred and
seventy years had passed since she last encountered a task she
could not perform. Any day now might be her last, but young
al&rsquo;Thor would be a fitting end to it all.</p>
