<h4><em>To Be Alone</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">S</span>lipping
the haft of his axe through the loop on his
belt opposite his quiver, Perrin took his unstrung longbow from the
corner, slung his saddlebags over his shoulder and left the rooms
he had shared with Faile without a backward look. They had been
happy there&mdash;most of the time. He did not think he would ever
be back. Sometimes he wondered whether being happy somewhere with
Faile meant he would never return there. He hoped not.</p>

<p>The servants he saw in the palace corridors wore
unrelieved black livery; perhaps Rand had ordered it, and perhaps
the servants themselves had simply adopted it. They had been uneasy
without livery, as though they did not know where they belonged,
and black seemed safe as Rand&rsquo;s color because of the
Asha&rsquo;man. Those who saw Perrin scampered away as fast as they
could, not waiting for any bows or curtsies. Fear scent drifted
behind them.</p>

<p>For once his yellow eyes had nothing to do with
anyone being afraid. It might not be safe to loiter near a man at
whom the Dragon Reborn had unleashed his rage so publicly this very
morning. Perrin eased the shoulder under his saddlebags. A long
while had passed since anyone had been able to pick him up and
throw him. Of course, no one had ever used the Power to try,
before. One moment in particular stuck with him.</p>

<p><em>He pushed himself up holding his shoulder,
sliding his back up the square column that had stopped his flight.
He thought a few ribs might have cracked. Around the Grand Hall of
the Sun, a scattering of nobles who had come to appeal one thing or
another to Rand tried to look anywhere else, tried to pretend they
were anywhere else. Only Dobraine watched, shaking his gray head,
as Rand stalked across the throne room.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I will deal with the Aes Sedai as I choose!&rdquo;
Rand shouted. &ldquo;Do you hear me, Perrin? As</em> I <em>choose!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>You&rsquo;ve just handed them over to the Wise
Ones,&rdquo; he growled back, shoving away from the column. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t know whether they&rsquo;re sleeping on silk or had their
throats cut! You are not the Creator!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>With a snarl of rage, Rand threw his head back. &ldquo;I am the Dragon Reborn!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care how
they&rsquo;re treated! They deserve a dungeon!&rdquo; Perrin&rsquo;s
hackles stirred as Rand&rsquo;s eyes lowered from the vaulted
ceiling. Blue ice would have been warm and soft beside them, the
more so because they stared from a face twisted with pain. &ldquo;Get out
of my sight, Perrin. Do you hear me? Get out of Cairhien! Today!
Now! I never want to see you again!&rdquo; Pivoting on his heel, he
strode away with nobles all but throwing themselves to the floor as
he passed.</em></p>

<p><em>Perrin thumbed a trickle of blood from the corner
of his mouth. For one moment there, he had been sure Rand was going
to kill him.</em></p>

<p>Shaking his head to rid himself of the thought, he
rounded a corner and nearly ran into Loial. With a large bundle
strapped to his back and a scrip big enough to hold a sheep slung
on his shoulder, the Ogier was using his long-handled axe as a
walking staff. The capacious pockets of his coat bulged with the
shapes of books.</p>

<p>Loial&rsquo;s tufted ears perked up at the sight of
him, then suddenly drooped. His whole face drooped, eyebrows
hanging on his cheeks. &ldquo;I heard, Perrin,&rdquo; he boomed sadly. &ldquo;Rand
should not have done that. Quick words make long troubles. I know
he&rsquo;ll reconsider. Tomorrow, maybe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Perrin told him. &ldquo;Cairhien is
too&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;polished&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;for me, anyway. I&rsquo;m a blacksmith, not
a courtier. By tomorrow, I&rsquo;ll be a long way gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You and Faile could come with me. Karldin and I are
going to visit the <em>stedding</em>, Perrin. All of them, about
the Waygates.&rdquo; A narrow-faced, pale-haired young fellow standing
behind Loial stopped frowning at Perrin to frown at the Ogier. He
had a scrip and a bundle, too, and a sword on his hip. Despite the
blue coat, Perrin recognized one of the Asha&rsquo;man. Karldin did
not look pleased to recognize Perrin; besides, his smell was cold
and angry. Loial peered down the hallway behind Perrin. &ldquo;Where is
Faile?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;meeting me in the stables. We had
words.&rdquo; That was simple truth; Faile seemed to <em>like</em>
shouting, sometimes. He lowered his voice. &ldquo;Loial, I wouldn&rsquo;t
talk about that where anyone could hear. The Waygates, I mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial snorted hard enough to make a bull jump, but he
did drop his tone. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anyone but us,&rdquo; he rumbled. No
one more than two or three paces beyond Karldin could have heard
clearly. His ears&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;lashed was the only word&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and laid
back angrily. &ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s afraid to be seen near you. After
all you&rsquo;ve done for Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Karldin tugged at Loial&rsquo;s sleeve. &ldquo;We have to
go,&rdquo; he said, glaring at Perrin. Anyone the Dragon Reborn shouted
at was outside the gates so far as he was concerned. Perrin
wondered whether he was holding the Power right then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; Loial murmured, waving a ham-sized hand,
but he leaned on his axe, frowning pensively. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like
this, Perrin. Rand chases you away. He sends me off. How I&rsquo;m
to finish my book&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; His ears twitched, and he coughed. &ldquo;Well,
that&rsquo;s neither here nor there. But you, me, and the Light
only knows where Mat is. He&rsquo;ll send Min away next. He hid from
her, this morning. He sent me out to tell her he wasn&rsquo;t there.
I think she knew I was lying. He&rsquo;ll be alone, then, Perrin. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s terrible to be alone.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what he
said to me. He is planning to send all of his friends away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills,&rdquo; Perrin said.
Loial blinked at that echo of Moiraine. Perrin had been thinking of
her a lot recently; she had been a restraining influence on Rand. &ldquo;Farewell, Loial. Keep safe, and don&rsquo;t trust anyone you
don&rsquo;t have to.&rdquo; He did not quite look at Karldin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that, Perrin.&rdquo; Loial sounded
shocked; he seemed to trust everyone. &ldquo;You cannot. Come with me,
you and Faile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll meet again, one day,&rdquo; Perrin told him
gently, and hurried past before he had to say more. He did not like
lying, especially not to a friend.</p>

<p>In the north stable things were much the same as
inside the palace. Grooms saw him walk in, and dropped dung forks
and curry combs, crowding out through small doors at the back.
Rustles in the loft high above that might have escaped
another&rsquo;s ears told of folk hiding there; he could hear
anxious, fearful breaths. He brought Stepper out of a
green-streaked marble stall, slipped on his bridle and tied the dun
stallion to a gilded hitching ring. He went to fetch blanket and
saddle from a marble tack room where half the saddles were mounted
with silver or gold. The stable fit very well in a palace, with
tall square marble columns and a marble floor, even under the straw
in the stalls. He rode out glad to see the back of grandeur.</p>

<p>North of the city he followed the road he had come
down so desperately with Rand just a few days before, rode until
folds in the land hid Cairhien. Then he turned off to the east,
where a fair patch of forest remained, running down one tall hill
and over the next, taller one. Just inside the trees, Faile booted
Swallow to meet him, Aram heeling her like a hound on his own
horse. Aram&rsquo;s face brightened at the sight of him, though that
was not saying much; he merely divided his faithful hound looks
between him and Faile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Husband,&rdquo; she said. Not too coolly, but razor-sharp
anger and spiky jealousy still threaded through the clean scent of
her and her herbal soap. She was garbed for travel, with a thin
dust-cloak hanging down her back and red gloves that matched the
boots peeking out beneath the dark narrow riding skirts she
favored. No fewer than four sheathed daggers were tucked behind her
belt.</p>

<p>Movement behind her turned into Bain and Chiad. And
Sulin, with a dozen more Maidens. Perrin&rsquo;s eyebrows rose. He
wondered what Gaul thought of that; the Aielman had said he was
looking forward to getting Bain and Chiad alone. Even more
surprising were Faile&rsquo;s other companions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are they doing here?&rdquo; He nodded toward a small
cluster who held their horses back. He recognized Selande and
Camaille and the tall Tairen woman, all still in men&rsquo;s clothes
and wearing swords. The blocky fellow in a fat-sleeved coat who had
kept his beard oiled and trimmed to a point despite wearing his
hair tied back with a ribbon also looked familiar. The other two
men, both Cairhienin, he did not know, but he could guess, by their
youth and the ribbon tying their hair if nothing else, that they
were part of Selande&rsquo;s &ldquo;society.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I took Selande and a few of her friends into my
service.&rdquo; Faile spoke lightly, but suddenly she gave off foggy
waves of caution. &ldquo;They would have gotten themselves into trouble
in the city, sooner or later. They need someone to give them
direction. Think of them as charity. I won&rsquo;t let them get
under your feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin sighed and scratched his beard. A wise man did
not tell his wife to her face that she was hiding things.
Especially when that wife was Faile; she was going to be as
formidable as her mother. If she was not already. Under his feet?
How many of these&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;puppies&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;had she taken on? &ldquo;Is
everything ready? Pretty soon some idiot back there will decide he
can curry favor by bringing Rand my head. I&rsquo;d like to be gone
before that.&rdquo; Aram growled in his throat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one is going to take your head, husband.&rdquo; Faile
showed white teeth, and went on in a whisper she knew he would
catch. &ldquo;Except perhaps me.&rdquo; In a normal voice, she said, &ldquo;All is
ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a clear, fairly flat hollow beyond the trees, the
Two Rivers men stood beside their horses, a column of twos that
wound out of sight around the side of the hill. Perrin sighed
again. The red wolfhead banner and the Red Eagle of Manetheren
stirred slightly in a hot breeze at the head of the column. Maybe
another dozen Maidens squatted on their heels near the banners; on
the other side, Gaul wore as close to a sullen expression as Perrin
had ever seen on an Aiel.</p>

<p>As he dismounted, two black-coated men came to him,
saluting with fist pressed to heart. &ldquo;Lord Perrin,&rdquo; Jur Grady said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been here since last night. We are ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grady&rsquo;s weathered farmer&rsquo;s face made Perrin
almost comfortable with him, but Fager Neald was another matter.
Maybe ten years younger than Grady, he might have been a farmer too
for all Perrin knew, but he affected airs and graces, and wore his
pitiful mustache waxed to a semblance of points. Where Grady was
one of the Dedicated, he was a Soldier, without the silver sword
pinned to his collar, but that did not hold him back from speaking. &ldquo;Lord Perrin, is it really necessary to take those women with us?
They&rsquo;ll be nothing but trouble, they will, the whole lot of
them, and you know it well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some of the women he was talking about stood not far
from the Two Rivers men, shawls looped over their arms. Edarra
appeared the eldest of the six Wise Ones impassively watching the
two women Neald had nodded to. In truth, that pair worried Perrin
as well. Seonid Traighan, all coolness and reserve in green silk,
had been haughtily trying to ignore the Aiel women&mdash;most
Cairhienin who were not pretending to be Aiel despised them&mdash;but when she saw Perrin, she shifted her bay&rsquo;s reins to the
other hand and gave Masuri Sokawa a nudge in the ribs. Masuri
started&mdash;Browns seemed to go off in daydreams fairly often&mdash;stared at the Green sister blankly, then directed her stare
at Perrin. This one was more the sort she might have given some
peculiar and perhaps dangerous animal, one she intended to be sure
of before she was done. They had sworn to obey Rand al&rsquo;Thor,
but how would they do obeying Perrin Aybara? Giving orders to Aes
Sedai seemed unnatural. But better than the other way around, at
least.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everybody comes,&rdquo; Perrin said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be gone
before we are seen.&rdquo; Faile sniffed.</p>

<p>Grady and Neald saluted again and strode out to the
middle of the treeless area. Perrin had no idea which of them did
what was necessary, but suddenly the now-familiar silvery vertical
flash in the air rotated into a gateway not quite tall enough to
ride through. Trees showed beyond the opening, not that much
different from those on the surrounding hills. Grady strode through
immediately, but even so he was nearly knocked down by Sulin and a
small horde of veiled Maidens. They seemed to have taken the honor
of being first through a gateway for themselves, and were not about
to let anyone usurp it.</p>

<p>Foreseeing a hundred problems he had not thought of,
Perrin led Stepper through into a land not so hilly. There was no
clearing, but it was not so thickly treed as the hollow back in
Cairhien, either. The scattered trees were taller, but just as
sere, even the pines. He did not recognize much else except for oak
and leatherleaf. The air seemed a little hotter.</p>

<p>Faile followed him, but when he turned to the left,
she took Swallow right. Aram&rsquo;s head swung worriedly between
them until Perrin nodded toward his wife. The onetime Tinker hauled
his gelding after her, but quick as he was, he was not before Bain
and Chiad, still veiled, and, for all Perrin&rsquo;s orders that the
Two Rivers men were to be next, Selande and a good two dozen young
Cairhienin and Tairens poured out of the gateway drawing their
horses along. Two dozen! Shaking his head, Perrin stopped beside
Grady, who turned this way and that, studying the sparse
woodland.</p>

<p>Gaul came stalking up as Dannil finally began leading
the Two Rivers men out at a run, pulling their horses. Those bloody
banners appeared right behind Dannil, going up as soon as they were
clear. The man ought to shave those fool mustaches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Women are beyond any belief,&rdquo; Gaul muttered.</p>

<p>Perrin opened his mouth to defend Faile before he
realized it must be Bain and Chiad the man was glaring at. To
cover, he said, &ldquo;Do you have a wife, Grady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sora,&rdquo; Grady answered absently, his attention still
on the surrounding trees. Perrin would have wagered he held the
Power now, for sure. Anyone could see a long way in this, compared
to any woods back home, but someone could still sneak up on you. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s missing me,&rdquo; Grady went on, almost to himself. &ldquo;You
learn to recognize that one right off. I wish I knew why her knee
hurts, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her knee hurts,&rdquo; Perrin said flatly. &ldquo;Right this
minute, it hurts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grady seemed to realize he was staring, and Gaul was
too. He blinked, but went right back to his study. &ldquo;Forgive me,
Lord Perrin. I need to keep a watch.&rdquo; For a long moment he said
nothing, then began slowly, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something a fellow named
Canler worked out. The M&rsquo;Hael doesn&rsquo;t like us
trying to figure out things on our own, but once it was done&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; His slight grimace said perhaps Taim had not been all that easy
about it even then. &ldquo;We think maybe it&rsquo;s something like the
bond between Warders and Aes Sedai. Maybe one in three of us is
married; anyway, that&rsquo;s how many wives stayed instead of
running off when they learned what their husbands were. This way,
when you&rsquo;re apart from her, you know she&rsquo;s all right, and
she knows you are. A man likes to know his wife&rsquo;s safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That he does,&rdquo; Perrin said. What was Faile up to
with those fools? She was mounted on Swallow now, and they were all
standing close around, looking up at her. He would not put it past
her to leap into this <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em> nonsense
herself.</p>

<p>Seonid and Masuri glided behind the last of the Two
Rivers men with the three Warders they had between them, and the
Wise Ones right behind them, which was no surprise. They were along
to keep an eye on the Aes Sedai. Seonid gathered her reins as if to
mount, but Edarra said something in a low voice, pointing to a fat
lopsided oak, and the two Aes Sedai looked at her, heads swiveling
as one, then exchanged glances and led their horses to the tree.
Matters would go a deal smoother if that pair was always so meek&mdash;well, not meek exactly; Seonid&rsquo;s neck was stiff as a
rod.</p>

<p>After that came the remounts, a herd of spare horses
tied ten to a lead, under the watchful eyes of folk from
Dobraine&rsquo;s estates who supposedly knew what they were about.
Perrin automatically picked out Stayer, on a lead by himself; the
woman taking care of him better know what she was doing. A great
many high-wheeled supply carts came through, drivers tugging the
horses and shouting as if they feared the gateway might close on
them&mdash;a great many because carts could not carry as much as
wagons, and carts because a wagon and team would not fit through
the gateway. It seemed neither Neald nor Grady could make one as
big as Rand could, or Dashiva.</p>

<p>When the last cart finally trundled out on a
squealing axle, Perrin considered ordering the gateway closed right
then, but Neald was the man holding the thing open, and him on the
other side of it back in Cairhien. A moment later, it was too
late.</p>

<p>Berelain strode through leading a mare as white as
Swallow was black, and he offered up small thanks that her gray
riding dress had a neck right to her chin. On the other hand, from
the waist up, it fit as snugly as any Taraboner dress. Perrin
groaned. With her came Nurelle and Bertain Gallenne, the Lord
Captain of her Winged Guards, a gray-haired fellow who wore his
black eyepatch as another man might a plume in his hat, and then
the red-armored Winged Guards themselves, more than nine hundred of
them. Nurelle and the rest who had been at Dumai&rsquo;s Wells wore
a yellow cord tied high on the left arm.</p>

<p>Climbing onto her mare, Berelain rode off to one side
with Gallenne while Nurelle formed the Winged Guards among the
trees. There must have been fifty paces between her and Faile, and
dozens of trees, but she placed herself where they could stare at
each other. Stare with so little expression that Perrin&rsquo;s skin
crawled. Putting Berelain at the rear, as far from Faile as he
could manage, had seemed a good notion, but he was going to face
this every bloody evening. Burn Rand!</p>

<p>Now Neald popped out of the gateway, stroking his
ridiculous mustache and preening for anyone who might be watching
as the opening vanished. No one was, and he climbed onto his horse
with a disgruntled expression.</p>

<p>Mounting Stepper, Perrin rode to a slight rise. Not
everyone could see him because of the trees, but it was enough they
could hear. A stir ran through the assemblage as he reined in,
people shifting for a better look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As far as anyone&rsquo;s eyes-and-ears back in
Cairhien know,&rdquo; he said loudly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been banished, the First
of Mayene is on her way back home, and the rest of you have just
disappeared like fog in the sun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To his surprise, they laughed. A cry of &ldquo;Perrin
Goldeneyes&rdquo; went up, and not just from the Two Rivers folk. He
waited for it to quiet; that took a while. Faile neither laughed
nor shouted, nor did Berelain. Each woman shook her head; neither
believed he should tell as much as he intended to. Then they saw
each other, and those shaking heads froze as if trapped in amber.
They did not like agreeing. It was no surprise when their eyes
swung to him with identical expressions. There was an old saying in
the Two Rivers, though how you said it and what you meant depended
on circumstance and who you were. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always a man&rsquo;s
fault.&rdquo; One thing, he had learned, women were better at than
anything else: teaching a man to sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of you may be wondering where we are, and why,&rdquo;
he went on when silence fell at last. A smaller ripple of laughter. &ldquo;This is Ghealdan.&rdquo; Murmurs of awe, and maybe disbelief, at having
crossed fifteen hundred miles or more in a step. &ldquo;The first thing
we have to do is convince Queen Alliandre we aren&rsquo;t here to
invade.&rdquo; Berelain was supposed to talk to Alliandre, and Faile was
going to give him fits for it. &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;re going to find a
fellow who calls himself the Prophet of the Lord Dragon.&rdquo; That
would not be much pleasure, either; Masema had been no joy before
he tipped over the edge. &ldquo;This Prophet has been causing some
problems, but we&rsquo;re going to let him know Rand al&rsquo;Thor
doesn&rsquo;t want anybody frightened into following him, and
we&rsquo;ll take him and any of his people who want to come back to
the Lord Dragon.&rdquo; <em>And we&rsquo;ll frighten the breeches off
Masema to do it if need be</em>, he though wryly.</p>

<p>They cheered. They whooped and shouted that they
would march this Prophet back to Cairhien for the Lord Dragon till
Perrin hoped this spot was even farther from any village than it
was supposed to be. Even the cart drivers and horse handlers joined
in. More than that, he prayed that everything went smoothly, and
quickly. The sooner he could put as much distance as possible
between Berelain and himself and Faile, the better. No surprises,
that was what he wanted once they rode south. It was about time his
being <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> showed itself good for something.</p>
