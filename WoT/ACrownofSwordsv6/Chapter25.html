<h4><em>Mindtrap</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">M</span>oghedien
did not want to dream the dream again, but
wanting to wake, wanting to scream, did no good. Sleep held her
faster than any manacles. The beginning went by quickly, a sketchy
blur. No mercy; she would have to relive the rest that much
sooner.</p>

<p><em>She barely recognized the woman who entered the
tent where she was held prisoner. Halima, secretary to one of these
fools who called themselves Aes Sedai. Fools, yet they held her
tightly enough by the band of silver metal around her neck, held
her and made her obey</em>. Fast movement, though she prayed for
slowness. <em>The woman channeled to make a light, and Moghedien
saw only the light. It had to be</em> saidin <em>&mdash;among the
living, only the Chosen knew how to tap the True Power</em>&mdash;the Power that came from the Dark One&mdash;<em>and few were fool
enough to except in direst need&mdash;but that was
impossible!</em> Blurring quickness. <em>The woman named herself
Aran&rsquo;gar and called Moghedien by name, she gave summons to the
Pit of Doom and removed the</em> a&rsquo;dam <em>necklace, flinching
at pain no woman should have felt. Again</em>&mdash;how many times
had she done this?&mdash;<em>again Moghedien wove a small gateway
in the tent. She Skimmed to give herself time to think in the
endless dark, but no sooner did she step onto her platform, like a
small enclosed marble balcony complete with a comfortable chair,
than she arrived on the black slopes of Shayol Ghul, forever
shrouded in twilight, where vents and tunnels emitted steam and
smoke and harsh vapors, and a Myrddraal came to her in its dead
black garb, like a slug-white, eyeless man, but taller, more
massive than any other Halfman. It regarded her arrogantly, and
gave its odd name unbidden, and commanded her to come; these were
not things Myrddraal did with the Chosen</em>. Now she screamed in
the depths of her mind for the dream to move faster, to blur beyond
seeing, beyond knowing, but <em>now, as she followed Shaidar
Haran&rsquo;s back into the entrance to the Pit of Doom, now all
flowed at its normal pace and seemed more real than</em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod <em>or the waking world</em>.</p>

<p>Tears leaked from Moghedien&rsquo;s eyes, down cheeks
that already glistened. She twitched on her hard pallet, arms and
legs jerking as she fought desperately, futilely, to wake. She was
no longer aware that she dreamed&mdash;all seemed real&mdash;but
deep memories remained, and in those depths, instinct shrieked and
clawed for escape.</p>

<p><em>She was well familiar with the sloping tunnel
ceilinged in stone daggers like fangs, the walls glowing with pale
light. Many times she had made this downward journey since the day
so long ago when she first came to make obeisance to the Great Lord
and pledge her soul, but never as now, never with her failure known
in all its magnitude. Always before she had managed to hide
failures even from the Great Lord. Many times. Things could be done
here that could be done nowhere else. Things could happen here that
could happen nowhere else.</em></p>

<p><em>She gave a start as one of the stone fangs
brushed her hair, then gathered herself as best she could. Those
spikes and blades still cleared the strange, too-tall Myrddraal
easily, but though it overtopped her by head and shoulders and
more, she was forced to move her head around their points now.
Reality was clay to the Great Lord here, and he often made his
displeasure known so. A stone tooth struck her shoulder, and she
ducked to go under another. There was no longer enough height in
the tunnel for her to straighten as she walked. She bent lower,
scurrying crouched in the Myrddraal&rsquo;s wake, trying to get
closer. Its stride never changed, but no matter how quickly she
scuttled, the interval between them did not lessen. The ceiling
descending, the Great Lord&rsquo;s fangs to rend traitors and fools,
and Moghedien dropped to hands and knees, crawling, then flattened
to elbows and knees. Light flared and flickered in the tunnel, cast
from the entrance to the Pit itself, just ahead, and Moghedien
slithered on her belly, pulled herself along with her hands, pushed
with her feet. Stone points dug at her flesh, caught at her dress.
Panting, she wriggled the last distance to the sound of ripping
wool.</em></p>

<p><em>Staring back over her shoulder, she shivered
convulsively. Where the tunnel mouth should have been stood a
smooth stone wall. Perhaps the Great Lord had timed it all exactly,
and perhaps, had she been slower</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>The ledge on which she lay projected above a
black-mottled red lake of molten rock where flames the size of men
danced and died and reappeared. Overhead, the cavern rose roofless
through the mountain to a sky where wild clouds raced, striated red
and yellow and black, as if on the winds of time themselves. It was
not the dark-clouded sky seen outside on Shayol Ghul. None of that
earned a second glance, and not just because she had seen it many
times. The Bore into the Great Lord&rsquo;s place of imprisonment
was no closer here than anywhere else in the world, but here she
could feel it, here she could bathe in the radiant glory of the
Great Lord. The True Power washed around her, so strong here that
attempting to channel it would fry her to a cinder. Not that she
had any desire to pay the price elsewhere either</em>.</p>

<p><em>She started to push up to her knees, and
something struck her between the shoulder blades, driving her down
hard onto the stone ledge, crushing the air from her lungs.
Stunned, she struggled for breath, then stared back up over her
shoulder. The Myrddraal stood with one massive boot planted firmly
on her back. Almost, she embraced</em> saidar<em>, though
channeling here without express permission was a good way to die.
The arrogance on the slopes above was one thing, but this!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Do you know who I am?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;I am
Moghedien!&rdquo; That eyeless gaze watched her as it might an insect;
she had often seen Myrddraal look at ordinary humans that
way.</em></p>

<p><em>MOGHEDIEN. That voice inside her head flushed
away all thought of the Myrddraal; it nearly flushed away all
thought. Beside this, any human lover&rsquo;s deepest embrace was a
drop of water beside the ocean. HOW DEEP IS YOUR FAILURE,
MOGHEDIEN? THE CHOSEN ARE ALWAYS THE STRONGEST, BUT YOU LET
YOURSELF BE CAPTURED. YOU TAUGHT THOSE WHO WOULD OPPOSE ME,
MOGHEDIEN.</em></p>

<p><em>Eyelids fluttering, she fought for coherence. &ldquo;Great Lord, I taught them only small things, and I fought them as
I could. I taught them a supposed way to detect a man channeling.&rdquo;
She managed to laugh. &ldquo;Practicing it gives them such headaches they
cannot channel for hours.&rdquo; Silence. Perhaps as well. They had given
up trying to learn that long before her rescue, but the Great Lord
did not need to know that. &ldquo;Great Lord, you know how I have served
you. I serve in the shadows, and your enemies never feel my bite
until my venom is working.&rdquo; She did not quite dare say she had
deliberately let herself be captured, to work from within, but she
could suggest. &ldquo;Great Lord, you know how many of your enemies I
brought down in the War of Power. From the shadows, unseen, or if
seen, ignored because I could not possibly be a threat.&rdquo; Silence.
And then&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><em>MY CHOSEN ARE ALWAYS THE STRONGEST. MY HAND
MOVES.</em></p>

<p><em>That voice reverberating in her skull turned her
bones to boiling honey and her brain to fire. The Myrddraal had her
chin in its hand, forcing her head up before her vision cleared
enough to see the knife in its other hand. All her dreams were to
end here in a slit throat, her body going to feed the Trollocs.
Perhaps Shaidar Haran would save a choice cut for itself. Perhaps&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><em>No. She knew she was going to die, but this
Myrddraal would not eat one shred of her! She reached to
embrace</em> saidar<em>, and her eyes bulged. There was nothing
there. Nothing! It was as if she had been severed! She knew she had
not&mdash;it was said that tearing was the deepest pain anyone
could know, beyond any power to deaden&mdash;but&mdash;!</em></p>

<p><em>In those stunned moments, the Myrddraal forced
her mouth open, scraped the blade along her tongue, then nicked her
ear. And as it straightened with her blood and saliva, she knew,
even before it produced what appeared to be a tiny, fragile cage of
gold wire and crystal. Some things could only be done here, some
only to those who could channel, and she had brought a number of
men and women for this very purpose.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>No,&rdquo; she breathed. Her eyes could not leave
the</em> cour&rsquo;souvra<em>. &ldquo;No, not me! NOT ME!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>Ignoring her, Shaidar Haran scraped the fluids
from the knife onto the</em> cour&rsquo;souvra. <em>The crystal
turned a milky pink, the first setting. With a flick of its wrist,
it tossed the mindtrap out over the lake of molten stone for the
second. The gold-and-crystal cage arched through the air and
suddenly stopped, floating at the very spot where it seemed the
Bore was, the place where the Pattern lay thinnest of all.</em></p>

<p><em>Moghedien forgot the Myrddraal. She flung out her
hands toward the Bore. &ldquo;Mercy, Great Lord!&rdquo; She had never noticed
that the Great Lord of the Dark possessed any mercy, but had she
been bound in a cell with rabid wolves or with a </em>darath<em> in moult,
she would have begged the same. In the right circumstances, you
begged even for the impossible. The</em> cour&rsquo;souvra <em>hung
in midair, turning slowly, glittering in the light of leaping fires
below. &ldquo;I have served you with all my heart, Great Lord. I beg
mercy. I beg! MERCYYYYYYY!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>YOU MAY SERVE ME STILL.</em></p>

<p><em>The voice flung her into ecstasy beyond knowing,
but at the same instant the sparkling mindtrap suddenly glowed like
the sun, and in the midst of rapture, she knew pain as if she had
been immersed in the fiery lake. They blended, and she howled,
thrashing like a mad thing, thrashing in endless pain, endless,
until after Ages, after nothing remained but agony and the memory
of agony, the tiny mercy of darkness overwhelmed her.</em></p>

<p>Moghedien stirred on the pallet. <em>Not again.
Please</em>.</p>

<p><em>She barely recognized the woman who entered the
tent where she was held prisoner.</em></p>

<p><em>Please</em>, she shrieked in the depths of her mind.</p>

<p><em>The woman channeled to make a light, and
Moghedien saw only the light.</em></p>

<p>Deep in sleep, she quivered, vibrating from head to
toe. <em>Please!</em></p>

<p><em>The woman named herself Aran&rsquo;gar and called
Moghedien by name, she gave summons to the Pit of Doom and&mdash;</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Wake, woman,&rdquo; said a voice like rotted bone
crumbling, and Moghedien&rsquo;s eyes popped open. She almost wished
for the dream back.</p>

<p>No door or window broke the featureless stone walls
of her small prison, and there were no glowbulbs or even lamps, but
light came from somewhere. She did not know how many days she had
been there, only that tasteless food appeared at irregular
intervals, that the single bucket serving for sanitation was
emptied at even more irregular times, and soap and a bucket of
perfumed water were somehow left for her to clean herself. She was
not sure whether that was a mercy or not; the glad thrill at seeing
a bucket of water reminded her how far she had fallen. Shaidar
Haran was in the cell with her now.</p>

<p>Hurriedly rolling from her pallet, she knelt and put
her face to the bare stone floor. She had always done whatever was
necessary for survival, and the Myrddraal had been all too glad to
teach her what was necessary. &ldquo;I greet you eagerly, <em>Mia&rsquo;cova</em>.&rdquo; The lashed-together title burned on her
tongue. &ldquo;One Who Owns Me,&rdquo; it meant, or simply, &ldquo;My Owner.&rdquo; The
strange shield Shaidar Haran had used on her&mdash;Myrddraal could
not, but it did&mdash;the shield was not in evidence, yet she did
not consider channeling. The True Power was denied her, of course&mdash;that could be drawn only with the Great Lord&rsquo;s blessing&mdash;but the Source tantalized, though the glow just beyond sight
seemed somehow odd. She still did not consider it. Every time the
Myrddraal visited, it displayed her mindtrap. Channeling too near
your own <em>cour&rsquo;souvra</em> was extremely painful, the
nearer, the more the pain; this close, she did not think she would
survive a simple touch on the Source. And that was the least of the
mindtrap&rsquo;s dangers.</p>

<p>Shaidar Haran chuckled, a rasp of dried, cracked
leather. That was another difference about this Myrddraal. Far more
cruel than Trollocs, who were merely bloodthirsty, Myrddraal were
cold and dispassionate in it. Shaidar Haran often showed amusement,
though. So far she felt lucky to have only bruises. Most women
would have been on the brink of madness by now, if not beyond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And are you eager to obey?&rdquo; that rustling, grating
voice asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am eager to obey, <em>Mia&rsquo;cova</em>.&rdquo;
Whatever was necessary to survive. But she still gasped when cold
fingers suddenly tangled in her hair. She scrambled to her feet on
her own as much as possible, but still was hauled up. At least this
time her feet remained on the floor. The Myrddraal studied her,
expressionless. Remembering past visits, it required an effort not
to flinch, or scream, or simply reach for <em>saidar</em> and make
an end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Close your eyes,&rdquo; it told her, &ldquo;and keep them closed
until you are commanded to open them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moghedien&rsquo;s eyes snapped shut. One of Shaidar
Haran&rsquo;s lessons had been instant obedience. Besides, with her
eyes closed, she could try to pretend that she was somewhere else.
Whatever was necessary.</p>

<p>Abruptly the hand in her hair rushed her forward, and
she screamed in spite of herself. The Myrddraal meant to run her
into the wall. Her hands went up for protection, and Shaidar Haran
released her. She staggered at least ten steps&mdash;but her cell
was not ten paces corner to corner. Wood smoke; she smelled a faint
touch of wood smoke. She kept her eyelids firmly closed, though.
She meant to continue with no more than bruises, and as few bruises
as possible, for as long as she could manage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can look now,&rdquo; a deep voice said.</p>

<p>She did, cautiously. The speaker was a tall,
broad-shouldered young man in black boots and breeches and a
flowing white shirt unlaced at the top, who watched her with
startlingly blue eyes from a deep, cushioned armchair in front of a
marble fireplace where flames danced along long logs. She stood in
a wood-paneled room that might have belonged to a wealthy merchant
or noble of moderate rank in this time, the furniture lightly
carved and touched with gilt, the rugs woven in red-and-gold
arabesques. She did not doubt it was somewhere close by Shayol
Ghul, though; it did not have the feel of <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, the only other possibility.
Swiveling her head hastily, she drew a deep breath. The Myrddraal
was nowhere to be seen. Tight bands of <em>cuande</em> seemed to
vanish from around her chest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you enjoy your time in the vacuole?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moghedien felt icy fingers dig into her scalp. She
was no researcher or maker, but she knew that word. She did not
even think to ask how a young man of this time did, too. Sometimes
there were bubbles in the Pattern, though someone like Mesaana
would say that was too simple an explanation. Vacuoles could be
entered, if you knew how, and manipulated much like the rest of the
world&mdash;researchers had often done great experiments in
vacuoles, so she vaguely remembered hearing&mdash;but they were
outside the Pattern really, and sometimes they closed up, or
perhaps broke off and drifted away. Even Mesaana could not say what
happened&mdash;except that anything in them at the time was gone
forever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long?&rdquo; She was surprised her voice was so
steady. She rounded on the young man, who sat there showing her
white teeth. &ldquo;I said, how long? Or don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw you arrive&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He paused, lifting a silver
goblet from the table beside his chair, eyes smiling at her over
the rim as he drank. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the night before last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She could not hide a relieved gasp. The only reason
anyone would want to enter a vacuole was that time flowed
differently there, sometimes slower, sometimes faster. Sometimes
much faster. She would not have been entirely surprised to learn
that the Great Lord had really imprisoned her for a hundred years,
or a thousand, to emerge into a world already his, to make her way
feeding among carrion while the other Chosen stood at the pinnacle.
She was still one of the Chosen, in her own mind, at least. Until
the Great Lord himself said she was not. She had never heard of
anyone being released once a mindtrap was set, but she would find a
way. There was always a way for those who were cautious, while
those fell who called caution cowardice. She herself had carried a
few of that so-called brave sort to Shayol Ghul to be fitted with
<em>cour&rsquo;souvra</em>.</p>

<p>Suddenly, it occurred to her that this fellow knew a
great deal for a Friend of the Dark, especially one not many years
past twenty. He swung one leg over an arm of the chair, lounging
insolently under her scrutiny. Graendal might have snatched him, if
he had any position or power; only too strong a chin kept him from
being pretty enough. She did not think she had ever seen eyes so
blue. With his insolence in her very face and what she had had to
endure at Shaidar Haran&rsquo;s hands so fresh, with the Source
calling her and the Myrddraal gone, she considered teaching this
young Friend of the Dark a sharp lesson. The fact that her clothes
were grimy added their part; she herself smelled faintly of the
perfume in the wash water, but she had had no way to clean the
rough woolen dress in which she fled Egwene al&rsquo;Vere, with its
rips from her journey down to the Pit. Prudence prevailed&mdash;this room must be close to Shayol Ghul&mdash;but barely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;Do you have any
idea who you are speaking to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do, Moghedien. You may call me Moridin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moghedien gasped. Not for the name; any fool could
call himself Death. But a tiny black fleck, just large enough to
see, floated straight across one of those blue eyes and then across
the other in the same line. This Moridin had tapped into the True
Power, and more than once. Much more. She knew that some men who
could channel survived in this time aside from al&rsquo;Thor&mdash;this fellow was much of a size with al&rsquo;Thor&mdash;but she
had not expected the Great Lord to allow one that particular honor.
An honor with a bite, as any of the Chosen knew. In the long run,
the True Power was far more addictive than the One Power; a strong
will could hold down the desire to draw more <em>saidar</em> or
<em>saidin</em>, but she herself did not believe the will existed
strong enough to resist the True Power, not once the <em>saa</em>
appeared in your eyes. The final price was different, but no less
terrible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been given distinction greater than you
know,&rdquo; she told him. As though her filthy dress was the finest
streith, she took the armchair opposite him. &ldquo;Bring me some of that
wine, and I will tell you. Only twenty-nine others have ever been
granted&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>To her shock, he laughed. &ldquo;You misapprehend,
Moghedien. You still serve the Great Lord, but not quite as you
once did. The time for playing your own games has passed. If you
had not managed to do some good by accident, you would be dead
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am one of the Chosen, boy,&rdquo; she said, fury burning
through caution. She sat up straight, facing him with all the
knowledge of an Age that made his little different from times of
mud huts. As much of that knowledge as she had, anyway, and in some
areas, concerning the One Power, no one outstripped her. She almost
embraced the Source no matter how close Shayol Ghul lay. &ldquo;Your
mother probably used my name to frighten you not so many years
gone, but know that grown men who could crumple you like a rag
sweated when they heard it. You will watch your tongue with
me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He reached into the open neck of his shirt, and her
own tongue clove to the roof of her mouth. Her eyes fixed on the
small cage of gold wire and blood-red crystal that he drew out
dangling on a cord. She thought vaguely that he tucked another just
like it back in, but she had eyes only for her own. It definitely
was hers. His thumb stroked, and she felt that caress across her
mind, her soul. Breaking a mindtrap did not require much more
pressure than he was using. She could be on the other side of the
world or farther, and it would not matter a hair. The part of her
that was <em>her</em> would be separated; she would still see with
her eyes and hear with her ears, taste what crossed her tongue and
feel what touched her, but helpless within an automaton that was
utterly obedient to whoever held the <em>cour&rsquo;souvra</em>.
Whether or not there was any way to get free of it, a mindtrap was
just what its name implied. She could feel the blood draining from
her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You understand now?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You still serve the
Great Lord, but now it will be by doing as I say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand, <em>Mia&rsquo;cova</em>,&rdquo; she said
automatically.</p>

<p>Again he laughed, a deep rich sound that mocked her
as he put the mindtrap away beneath his shirt. &ldquo;There is no need
for that, now you&rsquo;ve had your lesson. I will call you
Moghedien, and you will call me Moridin. You are still one of the
Chosen. Who is there to replace you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course, Moridin,&rdquo; she said tonelessly.
Whatever he said, she knew that she was owned.</p>
