<h4><em>Promises to Keep</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">W</span>e
are bloody well getting out of here now,&rdquo; Mat
said again later, and this time there was argument. There had been
argument for the past half hour, near enough. Outside, the sun was
past its noon peak. The trade winds cut the heat a little; stiff
yellow curtains fastened over the tall windows bulged and snapped
at gusts. Three hours back in the Tarasin Palace, the dice still
bouncing in his head, and he wanted to kick something. Or somebody.
He tugged at the scarf tied around his neck; it felt as though the
rope that had given him the scar under that scarf was back and
tightening slowly. &ldquo;Love of the Light, are you all blind? Or just
deaf?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The room Tylin had provided was large, with green
walls and high blue ceiling, and no furnishings but gilded chairs
and small tables set with pearlshell, yet it was crowded even so.
It seemed so, anyway. Tylin herself sat before one of the three
marble fireplaces with her knees crossed, watching him with those
dark eagle&rsquo;s eyes and a small smile, idly kicking her layered
blue and yellow petticoats, idly toying with the jeweled hilt of
her curved knife. He suspected Elayne or Nynaeve had spoken to her.
They were there, too, seated to either side of the Queen, somehow
in clean dresses and apparently even bathed, though they had only
been out of his sight for minutes at a stretch since returning to
the palace. They almost matched Tylin for regal dignity in their
bright silks; he was not sure who they wanted to impress, with all
that lace and elaborate embroidery. They looked ready for a royal
ball, not a journey. He himself was still in his muck, with his
dusty green coat hanging open and the silver foxhead caught in the
neck of his half undone shirt. Knotting the leather cord had
shortened it, but he wanted the medallion touching his skin. He was
around women who could channel, after all.</p>

<p>Truth, those three women could probably have crowded
the room by themselves. Tylin could have done it by herself, so far
as he was concerned; if Nynaeve or Elayne <em>had</em> spoken to
her, it was a very good thing that he was going. They three could
have done it alone, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is preposterous,&rdquo; Merilille announced. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard of any Shadowspawn called a <em>gholam</em>.
Have any of you?&rdquo; That was directed to Adeleas and Vandene,
Sareitha and Careane. Facing Tylin, the cool-eyed Aes Sedai
serenity of all five made a fair job of turning their high-backed
armchairs into thrones. He could not understand why Nynaeve and
Elayne just sat like lumps, coolly serene too, but absolutely
silent. They knew, they understood, and for some reason, Merilille
and that lot slathered their tongues with meekness for them, now.
Mat Cauthon, on the other hand, was a hairy-eared lout who needed
to be kicked, and from Merilille on down, they were all ready to do
the kicking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw the thing,&rdquo; he snapped, &ldquo;Elayne saw the thing,
Reanne and the Wise Women saw it. Ask any of them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gathered at one end of the room, Reanne and the five
surviving Wise Women shrank back like huddling hens, afraid of
actual questions. All but Sumeko, anyway; thumbs tucked behind her
long red belt, the round woman kept frowning at the Aes Sedai, then
shaking her head, frowning, then shaking her head. Nynaeve had had
a considerable talk with her in the privacy of the cabin on the
boat coming back, and Mat thought that had something to do with her
newfound attitude. He had caught mention of Aes Sedai more than
once; not that he had been trying to eavesdrop. The rest seemed to
be wondering whether they should offer to fetch tea. Only Sumeko
had even appeared to consider the offer of a chair. Sibella,
flapping bony arms in shock, had nearly fainted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one denies the word of Elayne Aes Sedai, Master
Cauthon,&rdquo; said Renaile din Calon Blue Star in a cool deep voice.
Even had the dignified woman in silks to match the red-and-yellow
floor tiles not been named to him earlier, the old memories meshed
into his own would have identified her as Windfinder to the
Mistress of the Ships by the ten fat gold rings in her earlobes,
those in each ear connected by a golden chain and half-hidden by
the narrow wings of white in her straight black hair. The
medallions clustered along the finer chain that ran to her nose
ring would tell him what clan she came from among other things. So
would the tattoos on her slim dark hands. &ldquo;What we question is the
danger,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;We do not like leaving the water without
good cause.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nearly twenty Sea Folk women stood gathered behind
her chair, a riot of colorful silks and earrings and medallions on
chains for the most part. The first odd thing he had noticed about
them was their attitude toward the Aes Sedai. They were perfectly
respectful, on the surface at any rate, but he had never before
seen anyone look at Aes Sedai <em>smugly</em>. The second odd thing
came from those other men&rsquo;s memories; he did not know a great
deal about the Sea Folk from them, but enough. Every Atha&rsquo;an
Miere, man or woman, began as the lowest deckhand whether they were
destined one day to become the Master of the Blades or the Mistress
of the Ships herself, and every step of the way between, the Sea
Folk were sticklers for rank to make any king or Aes Sedai look a
sloven. The women behind Renaile were a peculiar lot by any measure&mdash;Windfinders to Wavemistresses rubbing shoulders with
Windfinders from soarers, by their medallions&mdash;but two wore
bright blouses of plain wool above the dark oily breeches of
deckhands, each with a single thin ring in her left ear. A second
and third ring in the right indicated they were being trained as
Windfinders, but with two more to earn, not to mention the nose
ring, it would be a long while yet that either would find herself
called to haul sail whenever the deckmaster needed her, and find
the deckmaster&rsquo;s flail across her rump if she did not move
quickly enough. Those two did not belong in this gathering by any
memory he had; normally, the Windfinder to the Mistress of the
Ships would not even have spoken to one of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very much as I said, Renaile,&rdquo; Merilille said, icily
condescending. She had certainly noticed those smug glances. That
tone did not change as she shifted her attention to him. &ldquo;Do not
grow petulant, Master Cauthon. We are willing to listen to reason.
If you have any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat gathered patience; he hoped he could find enough.
Maybe if he used both hands and both feet. &ldquo;<em>Gholam</em> were
created in the middle of the War of the Power, during the Age of
Legends,&rdquo; he began from the beginning. Almost from the beginning of
what Birgitte had told him. He turned, facing each group of women
as he spoke. Burn him if he was going to let one bunch think they
were more important. Or that he was bloody pleading with them.
Especially since he was. &ldquo;They were made to assassinate Aes Sedai.
No other reason. To kill people who could channel. The One Power
won&rsquo;t help you; the Power won&rsquo;t touch a <em>gholam</em>.
In fact, they can sense the ability to channel, if they&rsquo;re
within, say, fifty paces of you. They can feel the power in you,
too. You won&rsquo;t know the <em>gholam</em> until it&rsquo;s too
late. They look just like anybody else. On the outside. Inside&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Gholam</em> have no bones; they can squeeze themselves under
a door. And they&rsquo;re strong enough to rip a door off steel
hinges with one hand.&rdquo; Or rip out a throat. Light, he should have
let Nalesean stay in bed.</p>

<p>Suppressing a shiver, he pressed on. The women, all
of them, watched him, almost not appearing to blink. He would not
let them see him shiver. &ldquo;There were only six <em>gholam</em> made&mdash;three male and three female; at least, that&rsquo;s what they
look like. Apparently even the Forsaken were a little uneasy about
them. Or maybe they just decided six was enough. Either way, we
know one is in Ebou Dar, probably kept alive since the Breaking in
a stasis-box. We don&rsquo;t know if any others were put into that
box, but one is more than enough. Whoever sent him&mdash;and it
had to be one of the Forsaken&mdash;knew to follow us across the
river. He had to have been sent after the Bowl of the Winds, and by
what he said to me, to kill Nynaeve or Elayne, maybe both.&rdquo; He
spared them a quick look, soothing and sympathetic; nobody could
feel easy knowing that thing was after them. In return he received
a puzzled frown from Elayne, just the smallest wrinkling of her
forehead, and from Nynaeve a slight wave of the hand, an impatient
wave, to get on with it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;To continue,&rdquo; he said, shooting the pair of
them a glare. It was very hard not to sigh, dealing with women. &ldquo;Whoever sent the <em>gholam</em> has to know the Bowl is here in
the Tarasin Palace, now. If he, or she, sends the <em>gholam</em>
here, some of you are going to die. Maybe a lot of you. I
can&rsquo;t protect all of you at once. Maybe he&rsquo;ll get the
Bowl, too. And that&rsquo;s on top of Falion Bhoda; small chance
she&rsquo;s alone, even with Ispan a prisoner, so that means we have
the Black Ajah to worry about, as well. Just in case the Forsaken
and <em>gholam</em> aren&rsquo;t enough for you.&rdquo; Reanne and the
Wise Women drew themselves up even more indignantly than Merilille
and her friends at mention of the Black Ajah, and the Aes Sedai,
stiffening and gathering skirts, looked ready to stalk out in a
huff. Press on; that was all he could do. &ldquo;Now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Now do you see
why you all have to leave the palace and take the Bowl somewhere
the <em>gholam</em> doesn&rsquo;t know about? Somewhere the Black
Ajah doesn&rsquo;t know? Do you see why it has to be done now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Renaile&rsquo;s sniff would have startled geese in the
next room. &ldquo;You merely repeat yourself, Master Cauthon. Merilille
Sedai says she has never heard of this <em>gholam</em>. Elayne
Sedai says there was a strange man, a creature, but little else.
What is this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>stasis</em>-box! You have not explained
that. How do you know what you claim to know? Why should we go any
further from the water than we are on the word of a man who creates
fables from air?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat looked to Nynaeve and Elayne, though with little
hope. If they would only open their mouths, this could been have
been finished long since, but they gazed back at him, practicing
expressionless Aes Sedai masks till their jaws must be creaking. He
could not understand their silence. A bare-bones account of events
in the Rahad had been all they gave, and he was willing to bet they
would not have mentioned the Black Ajah at all had there been any
other way to explain showing up in the palace with an Aes Sedai
bound and shielded. Ispan was being held in another part of the
palace, her presence known only to a handful. Nynaeve had forced
some concoction down her throat, a foul-smelling mix of herbs that
bulged the woman&rsquo;s eyes going down and had her giggling and
stumbling in short order, and the rest of the Knitting Circle
occupied the room with her for guards. Unwilling guards, but very
assiduous; Nynaeve had made it extremely clear that should they let
Ispan get away, they had best start running before she laid hands
on them again.</p>

<p>He very carefully did not look toward Birgitte,
standing beside the door with Aviendha. The Aiel woman wore an Ebou
Dari dress; not the plain wool she had returned in, but a
silver-gray silk riding dress that jarred with her plain-sheathed
horn-handled belt knife. Birgitte had been quick to shed her own
dress for her usual short coat and wide trousers, these dark blue
and dark green. A quiver already hung at her hip. She was the
source of everything he knew about <em>gholam</em>&mdash;and
stasis-boxes&mdash;except what his eyes had seen in the Rahad. And
he would not have revealed that on a hot grill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I read a book once that talked about&mdash;&rdquo; he
began, and Renaile cut him off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A book,&rdquo; she sneered. &ldquo;I will not abandon the salt
for a book Aes Sedai do not know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly it struck Mat that he was the only man
present. Lan had gone off at Nynaeve&rsquo;s command, gone as tamely
as Beslan had at his mother&rsquo;s. Thom and Juilin were packing to
leave. Had probably finished packing by now. If there was any use
to it; if they ever did leave. The only man, surrounded by a wall
of women who apparently intended to let him beat his head against
that wall till his brains were scrambled. It made no sense. None.
They looked at him, waiting.</p>

<p>Nynaeve, in yellow-slashed lace-trimmed blue, had
pulled her braid over her shoulder so it hung down between her
breasts, but that heavy gold ring&mdash;Lan&rsquo;s ring, he had
learned&mdash;was carefully positioned to show anyway. Her face
was smooth, and her hands rested in her lap, yet sometimes her
fingers twitched. Elayne, in green Ebou Dari silk that made Nynaeve
seem covered up despite the smoky lace collar under her chin, gazed
back at him with eyes like cool pools of deep blue water. Her hands
lay in her lap too, but now and again she would begin to trace the
thread-of-gold embroidery that covered her skirts, then immediately
stop. Why did they not say something? Were they trying to get back
at him? Was it just a case of &ldquo;Mat wants to be in charge so much,
let him see how well he can do without us&rdquo;? He might have believed
it of Nynaeve, any time but this anyway, but not of Elayne, not
anymore. So why?</p>

<p>Reanne and the Wise Women did not huddle away from
him as they did from the Aes Sedai, but their manner toward him had
changed. Tamarla gave him a decently respectful nod. Honey-haired
Famelle went so far as a friendly smile. Strangely, Reanne blushed,
a pale stain. But they did not count as opposition, really. The six
women had not said a dozen unprompted words between them since
entering this room. Every one would jump if Nynaeve or Elayne
snapped her fingers, and keep jumping until told to stop.</p>

<p>He turned to the rest of the Aes Sedai. Faces
infinitely calm, infinitely patient. Except&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Merilille&rsquo;s
eyes flickered past him toward Nynaeve and Elayne for one instant.
Sareitha began slowly smoothing her skirts under his gaze,
seemingly unaware of doing so. A dark suspicion bloomed in his
mind. Hands moving on skirts. Reanne&rsquo;s blush. Birgitte&rsquo;s
ready quiver. A murky suspicion. He did not really know of what.
Just that he had been going about this the wrong way. He gave
Nynaeve a stern look, and Elayne a sterner. Butter would not have
melted on their bloody tongues.</p>

<p>Slowly he walked toward the Sea Folk. He just walked,
but he heard someone with Merilille sniff, and Sareitha muttered, &ldquo;Such insolence!&rdquo; Well, he was about to show them insolence. If
Nynaeve and Elayne did not like it, they should have taken him into
their confidence. Light, but he hated being used. Especially when
he did not know how, or why.</p>

<p>Stopping in front of Renaile&rsquo;s chair, he studied
the dark faces of the Atha&rsquo;an Miere women behind it before
looking down to her. She frowned, stroking a knife set with
moonstones thrust behind her sash. She was a handsome woman rather
than pretty, somewhere in her middle years, and under different
circumstances he might have enjoyed looking at her eyes. They were
large black pools a man could spend an evening just gazing into.
Under different circumstances. Somehow, the Sea Folk were the fly
in the cream pitcher, and he had not a clue how to pluck it out. He
managed to keep his irritation under control. Barely. What to
bloody do?</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can all channel, I understand,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;but that doesn&rsquo;t mean much to me.&rdquo; As well be straight from
the start. &ldquo;You can ask Adeleas or Vandene how much I care whether
a woman can channel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Renaile looked past him toward Tylin, but it was not
to the Queen she spoke. &ldquo;Nynaeve Sedai?&rdquo; she said dryly, &ldquo;I
believe there was no mention in your bargain of my having to listen
to this young oakum picker. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t bloody care about your bargains with
anybody else, you daughter of the sands,&rdquo; Mat snapped. So his
irritation was not that well under control. A man could only take
so much.</p>

<p>Gasps rose among the women behind her. Something over
a thousand years ago a Sea Folk woman had called an Essenian
soldier a son of the sands just before trying to plant a blade in
his ribs; the memory lay tucked inside Mat Cauthon&rsquo;s head,
now. It was not the worst insult among the Atha&rsquo;an Miere, but
it came close. Renaile&rsquo;s face gorged with blood; hissing, eyes
bulging in fury, she leaped to her feet, that moonstone-studded
dagger flashing in her fist.</p>

<p>Mat snatched it out of her hand before the blade
could reach his chest and shoved her back into her chair. He did
have quick hands. He could still hold on to his temper, too. No
matter how many women thought they could dance him for a puppet, he
could&mdash;&ldquo;You listen to me, you bilge stone.&rdquo; All right; maybe
he could not hold it. &ldquo;Nynaeve and Elayne need you, or I&rsquo;d
leave you for the <em>gholam</em> to crack your bones and the Black
Ajah to pick over what&rsquo;s left. Well, as far as you&rsquo;re
concerned, I&rsquo;m the Master of the Blades, and my blades are
bare.&rdquo; What that meant exactly, he had no idea, except for having
once heard, &ldquo;When the blades are bare, even the Mistress of the
Ships bows to the Master of the Blades.&rdquo; &ldquo;This is the bargain
between you and me. You go where Nynaeve and Elayne want, and in
return, I won&rsquo;t tie the lot of you across horses like
packsaddles and haul you there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was no way to go on, not with the Windfinder to
the Mistress of the Ships. Not with a bilgeboy off a broken-backed
darter, for that matter. Renaile quivered with the effort of not
going for him with her bare hands, and never mind her dagger in his
hand. &ldquo;It is agreed, under the Light!&rdquo; she growled. Her eyes nearly
started out of her head. Her mouth worked, confusion and disbelief
suddenly chasing one another across her face. This time, the gasps
sounded as if the wind had ripped the curtains down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is agreed,&rdquo; Mat said quickly, and touching
fingers to his lips, he pressed them to hers.</p>

<p>After a moment, she did the same, fingers trembling
against his mouth. He held out the dagger, and she stared dully at
it before taking it from him. The blade went back into its jeweled
sheath. It was not polite to kill someone you had sealed a bargain
with. At least, not until the terms were fulfilled. Murmurs began
among the women behind her chair, rising, and Renaile stirred
herself to clap her hands once. That silenced Windfinders to
Wavemistresses as quickly as the two deckhands in training.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I have just made a bargain with a <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>,&rdquo; she said in that cool, deep voice. The woman
could teach Aes Sedai how to pull themselves together quickly. &ldquo;But
one day, Master Cauthon, if it pleases the Light, I think you will
walk a rope for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not know what that meant, except that she made
it sound unpleasant. He made his best leg. &ldquo;All things are
possible, if it pleases the Light,&rdquo; he murmured. Courtesy paid,
after all. But her smile was disturbingly hopeful.</p>

<p>When he turned back to the rest of the room, you
would have thought he had horns and wings, for the stares. &ldquo;Is
there any further argument?&rdquo; he asked in a wry tone, and did not
wait for answers. &ldquo;I thought not. In that case, I suggest you pick
out some spot well away from here, and we can be on our way as soon
as you bundle up your belongings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They made a show of discussion. Elayne mentioned
Caemlyn, sounding at least half-serious, and Careane suggested
several remote villages in the Black Hills, all easily reached by
gateway. Light, anywhere was easily reached by gateway. Vandene
spoke of Arafel, and Aviendha suggested Rhuidean, in the Aiel
Waste, with the Sea Folk women growing glummer the farther from the
sea were the places named. All a show. To Mat, at least, that was
clear by Nynaeve&rsquo;s impatient fiddling with her braid despite
the suggestions coming hot and fast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I may speak, Aes Sedai?&rdquo; Reanne said timidly at
last. She even raised her hand. &ldquo;The Kin maintain a farm on the
other side of the river, a few miles north. Everyone knows it is a
retreat for women who need contemplation and quiet, but no one
connects it to us. The buildings are large and quite comfortable,
if there&rsquo;s any need to stay long, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Nynaeve broke in. &ldquo;Yes, I think that sounds
just the thing. What do you say, Elayne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it sounds wonderful, Nynaeve. I know Renaile
will appreciate staying close to the sea.&rdquo; The other five sisters
practically piled on top of her saying how agreeable it sounded,
how superior to any other suggestion.</p>

<p>Mat rolled his eyes to the heavens. Tylin was a study
in not seeing what lay under her nose, but Renaile snapped at it
like a trout taking a lacewing. Which was the point, of course. For
some reason she was not to know that Nynaeve and Elayne had had
everything arranged beforehand. She led the rest of the Sea Folk
women out to gather whatever belongings they had brought before
Nynaeve and Elayne could change their minds.</p>

<p>Those two would have followed Merilille and the other
Aes Sedai, but he crooked a finger at them. They exchanged glances&mdash;he would have had to talk an hour to say as much as passed
in those looks&mdash;then, somewhat to his surprise, came to him.
Aviendha and Birgitte watched from the door, Tylin from her
chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry to have used you,&rdquo; Elayne said
before he could get a word out. Her smile flashed that dimple at
him. &ldquo;We did have reasons, Mat; you must believe that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which you do not need to know,&rdquo; Nynaeve put in
firmly, flipping her braid back over her shoulder with a practiced
toss of her head that made the gold ring bounce on her bosom. Lan
must be insane. &ldquo;I must say, I never expected you to do what you
did. Whatever in the world made you think of trying to <em>bully</em> them? You could have ruined everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s life if you don&rsquo;t take a chance now
and then?&rdquo; he said blithely. As well by him if they thought it was
planned instead of temper. But they had used him again without
telling him, and he wanted a bit back for that. &ldquo;Next time you have
to make a bargain with the Sea Folk, let me make it for you. Maybe
that way, it won&rsquo;t turn out as badly as the last one.&rdquo; Spots
of color blooming in Nynaeve&rsquo;s cheeks told him he had hit the
mark squarely. Not bad shooting blindfolded.</p>

<p>Elayne, though, just murmured &ldquo;A most <em>observant</em> subject&rdquo; in tones of rueful amusement. Being in her
good books might turn out less comfortable than being in her
bad.</p>

<p>They swept toward the door without letting him say
more. Well, he had not really thought they would explain anything.
Both were Aes Sedai to the bone. A man learned to live with what he
had to.</p>

<p>Tylin had all but slipped from his mind, but he had
not from hers. She caught him up before he took two steps. Nynaeve
and Elayne paused at the door with Aviendha and Birgitte, watching.
So they saw when Tylin pinched his bottom. Some things, nobody
could learn to live with. Elayne put on a face of commiseration,
Nynaeve of glowering disapproval. Aviendha fought laughter none too
successfully, while Birgitte wore her grin openly. They <em>all</em> bloody knew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve thinks you are a little boy needing
protection,&rdquo; Tylin breathed up at him. &ldquo;I know you are a grown
man.&rdquo; Her smoky chuckle made that the dirtiest comment he had ever
heard. The four women by the door got to watch his face turn beet
red. &ldquo;I will miss you, pigeon. What you did with Renaile was
magnificent. I do so admire masterful men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll miss you, too,&rdquo; he muttered. To his shock,
that was simple truth. He was leaving Ebou Dar just in time. &ldquo;But
if we meet again, I&rsquo;ll do the chasing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She chortled at him, and those dark eagle&rsquo;s eyes
almost glowed. &ldquo;I admire masterful men, duckling. But not when they
try being masterful with me.&rdquo; Seizing his ears, she pulled his head
down where she could kiss him.</p>

<p>He never saw Nynaeve and the others go, and he walked
out on unsteady legs, tucking his shirt back in. He had to return
to fetch his spear from the corner, and his hat. The woman had no
shame. Not a scrap of it.</p>

<p>He found Thom and Juilin, coming out of Tylin&rsquo;s
apartments, followed by Nerim and Lopin, Nalesean&rsquo;s stout man,
who each lugged a large wicker pannier made for a packsaddle.
Loaded with his belongings, he realized. Juilin carried Mat&rsquo;s
unstrung bow and had his quiver slung on one shoulder. Well, she
had said she was moving him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I found this on your pillow,&rdquo; Thom said, tossing him
the ring he had bought what seemed a year ago. &ldquo;A parting gift, it
seems; there were loversknots and some other flowers strewn over
<em>both</em> pillows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat jammed the ring onto his finger. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s mine,
burn you. I paid for it myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old gleeman knuckled his mustaches and coughed in
a failed effort to stifle a sudden wide grin. Juilin snatched off
that ridiculous Taraboner hat and became engrossed in studying the
inside of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blood and flaming&mdash;!&rdquo; Mat drew a deep breath. &ldquo;I hope you two spared a moment for your own belongings,&rdquo; he said
levelly, &ldquo;because as soon as I grab Olver, we&rsquo;re on our way,
even if we happen to leave a moldy harp or a rusty sword-breaker
behind.&rdquo; Juilin tugged at the corner of his eye with one finger,
whatever that was supposed to mean, but Thom actually frowned.
Insults to Thom&rsquo;s flute or his harp were insults to
himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; Lopin said mournfully. He was a dark,
balding man, rounder than Sumeko, and his black Tairen
commoner&rsquo;s coat, tight to the waist then flaring, like
Juilin&rsquo;s, fit very tightly indeed. Normally almost as solemn
as Nerim, now he had reddened eyes, as though he had been weeping. &ldquo;My Lord, is there any chance I might remain to see Lord Nalesean
buried? He was a good master.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat hated saying no. &ldquo;Anybody left behind might be
left for a long time, Lopin,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;Listen, I&rsquo;ll
need someone to help look after Olver. Nerim has his hands full
with me. For that matter, Nerim will go back to Talmanes, you know.
If you&rsquo;d like, I will take you on myself.&rdquo; He had grown used
to having a manservant, and these were hard times for a man
hunting work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like that very much, my Lord,&rdquo; the fellow
said lugubriously. &ldquo;Young Olver reminds me much of my youngest
sister&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Only, when they entered Mat&rsquo;s former rooms, the
Lady Riselle was there, much more decently clothed than when he had
last seen her, and quite alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should I have kept him tied to me?&rdquo; she said,
that truly marvelous bosom heaving with emotion as she planted her
fists on her hips. The Queen&rsquo;s duckling, it seemed, was not
supposed to take a snappish tone with the Queen&rsquo;s attendants. &ldquo;Clip a boy&rsquo;s wings too far, and he will never grow to a
proper man. He read his pages aloud sitting on my knee&mdash;he
might have read all day, had I allowed it&mdash;and did his
numbers, so I let him go. Why are you in such a bother? He promised
to return by sunset, and he seems to set a great store by his
promises.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Propping the <em>ashandarei</em> in its old corner,
Mat told the other men to drop their burdens and go find Vanin and
the remaining Redarms. Then he left Riselle&rsquo;s spectacular
bosom and ran all the way to the rooms Nynaeve and the other women
shared. They were all there, in the sitting room, and so was Lan,
with his Warder&rsquo;s cloak already draped down his back and
saddlebags on his shoulders. His saddlebags and Nynaeve&rsquo;s, it
seemed. A good many bundles of dresses and not-so-small chests
stood about the floor. Mat wondered if they would make Lan carry
those, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you have to go find him, Mat Cauthon,&rdquo;
Nynaeve said. &ldquo;Do you think we would just abandon the child?&rdquo; To
hear her, you would have thought that was exactly what <em>he</em>
had intended.</p>

<p>Suddenly he was deluged with offers of help, not just
Nynaeve and Elayne proposing to put off going to the farm, but Lan
and Birgitte and Aviendha offering to join the search. Lan was
stone cold about it, grim as ever, but Birgitte and Aviendha&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My heart would break if anything happened to that
boy,&rdquo; Birgitte said, and Aviendha added, just as warmly, &ldquo;I have
always said you do not care for him properly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat ground his teeth. In the streets of the city,
Olver might well elude eight men until he appeared back at the
palace at sunset. He did keep his promises, but small chance he
would give up one moment of freedom he did not have to. More eyes
would mean a quicker search, especially if all of the Wise Women
were brought into it. For the space of three heartbeats he
hesitated. He had his own promises to keep, though he was wise
enough not to put it that way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Bowl is too important,&rdquo; he told them. &ldquo;That <em>gholam</em> is still out there, and maybe Moghedien, and the Black
Ajah for sure.&rdquo; The dice thundered in his head. Aviendha would not
appreciate being lumped in with Nynaeve and Elayne, but he did not
care right then. He addressed Lan and Birgitte. &ldquo;Keep them safe
until I can reach you. Keep all of them safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Startlingly, Aviendha said, &ldquo;We will. I promise.&rdquo; She
fingered the hilt of her knife. Apparently she did not understand
she was one of those to be kept safe.</p>

<p>Nynaeve and Elayne did. Nynaeve&rsquo;s sudden glare
tried to bore a hole through his skull; he expected her to yank on
her braid, but strangely, her hand only fluttered toward it before
being put firmly to her side. Elayne contented herself with raising
her chin, those big blue eyes frosty. No dimple here.</p>

<p>Lan and Birgitte understood, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve is my life,&rdquo; Lan said simply, putting a hand
on her shoulder. The odd thing was, she suddenly looked very sad,
and then just as suddenly, her jaw set as though she was preparing
to walk through a stone wall and make a large hole.</p>

<p>Birgitte gave Elayne a fond look, but it was to Mat
she spoke. &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Honor&rsquo;s truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat tugged at his coat uncomfortably. He still was
not sure how much he had told her while drunk. Light, but the woman
could soak it up like dry sand. Even so, he gave the proper
response for a Barashandan lord, accepting her pledge. &ldquo;The honor
of blood; the truth of blood.&rdquo; Birgitte nodded, and from the
startled looks he received from Nynaeve and Elayne, she still kept
his secrets close. Light, if any Aes Sedai ever found out about
those memories, they might as well know he had blown the Horn as
well; foxhead or no foxhead, they would stretch him out till they
dug out every last why and how.</p>

<p>As he was turning to go, Nynaeve caught his sleeve. &ldquo;Remember the storm, Mat. It&rsquo;s going to break soon; I know it.
You take care of yourself, Mat Cauthon. Do you hear me? Tylin has
directions for the farm, when you get back with Olver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nodding, he made his escape, the dice in his head
like echoes of his running boots. Was it during the search that he
was supposed to take care of himself, or while getting the
directions from Tylin? Nynaeve and her Listening to the Wind. Did
she think a little rain was going to melt him? Come to think, once
they used the Bowl of the Winds, it would rain again. It seemed
years since rain last fell. Something tugged at his thoughts,
something about the weather, and Elayne, which made no sense, but
he shrugged it off. One thing at a time, and the one thing right
now was Olver.</p>

<p>The men were all waiting in the Redarms&rsquo; long
room near the stables, everyone on their feet except Vanin, who lay
sprawled on one of the beds with his fingers laced over his belly.
Vanin said a man had to take rest when he could. He swung his boots
over and sat up when Mat entered, though. He cared about Olver as
much as any of the others; Mat was just afraid the man was going to
start teaching him how to steal horses and poach pheasants. Seven
sets of eyes focused on Mat intently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Riselle said Olver&rsquo;s wearing his red coat,&rdquo; he
told them. &ldquo;He gives them away, sometimes, but any urchin you see
in a good red coat probably knows where Olver last was. Everybody
goes in a different direction. Make loops out from the Mol Hara,
and try to be back after about an hour. Wait till everybody is back
before you go out again. That way, if somebody finds him, the rest
of us won&rsquo;t still be looking tomorrow. Does everybody
understand?&rdquo; They nodded.</p>

<p>Sometimes it amazed him. Lanky Thom with his white
hair and mustaches, who had been a Queen&rsquo;s lover once, and
more willingly than himself, not to mention more than a lover, if
you believed half he said. Square-jawed Harnan with that tattoo on
his cheek and more elsewhere, who had been a soldier all his life.
Juilin with his bamboo staff and his sword-breaker on his hip, who
thought himself as good as any lord even if the idea of carrying a
sword himself still made him uneasy, and fat Vanin, who made Juilin
look a bootlicker by comparison. Skinny Fergin, and Gorderan,
nearly as wide in the shoulders as Perrin, and Metwyn, whose pale
Cairhienin face still looked like a boy&rsquo;s despite being years
older than Mat. Some of them followed Mat Cauthon because they
thought he was lucky, because his luck might keep them alive when
the swords were out, and some for reasons he was not really sure
of, but they followed. Not even Thom had ever more than protested
an order of his. Maybe Renaile had been more than luck. Maybe his
being <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> did more than dump him in the-middle
of trouble. Suddenly he felt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;responsible&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;for these men.
It was an uncomfortable feeling. Mat Cauthon and responsibility did
not go together. It was unnatural.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take care of yourselves, and look sharp,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You know what&rsquo;s out there. There&rsquo;s a storm coming.&rdquo; Now
why had he said that? &ldquo;Move. We&rsquo;re wasting light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wind still blew strongly, sweeping dust across
the Mol Hara Square with its statue of a long-dead queen posing
above the fountain, but there was no other sign of a storm. Nariene
had been noted for her honesty, but not enough to have been
depicted completely bare-chested. The afternoon sun burned high in
a sky without a cloud, but people rushed through the square as
quickly as they had in the morning cool. That was gone, wind or no,
down here on the ground. The paving stones seemed a griddle under
his boots.</p>

<p>Glaring across the square at The Wandering Woman, Mat
headed toward the river. Olver had not gone off with the street
urchins half as often while they were staying at the inn; he had
been too content ogling the serving girls and Setalle Anan&rsquo;s
daughters. So much for the dice telling him he had to move into the
palace. Anything he had done since leaving&mdash;anything he
wanted to do, he amended, thinking of Tylin and her eyes; and her
hands&mdash;any of it could have been done just as well from
there. Those dice spun now, and he wished they would just go
away.</p>

<p>He tried to move quickly, dodging impatiently around
trundling carts and wagons, cursing at lacquered sedan chairs and
coaches that nearly ran him down, eyes darting in search of a red
coat close to the ground, but the bustle in the streets slowed him
to a meander. Which was just as well, in truth. No point dashing by
the boy without seeing him. Wishing he had brought Pips out of the
palace stables, he frowned at the people streaming past; a man on
horseback could have moved no faster in the throng, but up in the
saddle, he could have seen farther. Then again, asking questions
from a saddle would have been awkward; not many folk actually rode
inside the city, and some people had a tendency to shy away from
anyone on a horse.</p>

<p>Always the same question. The first time he asked was
at a bridge just below the Mol Hara, of a fellow selling
honey-baked apples from a tray hanging from a strap around his
neck. &ldquo;Have you seen a boy, about so high, in a red coat?&rdquo; Olver
liked sweets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boy, my Lord?&rdquo; the fellow said, sucking his few
remaining teeth. &ldquo;Seen a thousand boys. Don&rsquo;t remember no
coat, though. Would my Lord like one apple, or two?&rdquo; He scooped up
two with bony fingers and pushed them at Mat; the way they gave
under his fingers, they were softer than any baking could account
for. &ldquo;Did my Lord hear about the riot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Mat said sourly, and pushed on. At the other
end of the bridge, he stopped a plump woman with a tray of ribbons.
Ribbons held no fascination for Olver, but her red petticoats
flashed beneath a skirt sewn up nearly to her left hip, and the cut
of her bodice revealed rounded cleavage to equal Riselle&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Have you seen a boy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He heard about the riot from her, too, and from half
the people he asked. That rumor, he suspected had begun with events
at a certain house in the Rahad that very morning. A wagon driver
with her long whip coiled around her neck even told him the riot
had been across the river, once she allowed as how she never
noticed boys unless they ran under her mules. A square-faced man
who sold honeycomb&mdash;incredibly dry-looking honeycomb&mdash;said the riot had been down near the light tower at the end of the
Bay Road, on the eastern side of the mouth of the bay, which was
about as likely a place for rioting as the middle of the bay
itself. There were always a thousand rumors in any city, if you
listened, and he was forced to listen to snatches of all of them,
it seemed. One of the most remarkably pretty women he had ever
seen, standing outside a tavern&mdash;Maylin was a serving girl at
The Old Sheep, but her only task seemed to be standing outside to
attract customers, which she certainly did&mdash;told him there
had been a battle that morning, in the Cordese Hills west of the
city, she thought. Or maybe in the Rhannon Hills, across the bay.
Or maybe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Remarkably pretty, Maylin, but not very bright;
Olver might have watched her for hours, so long as she never opened
her mouth. But she could not remember seeing any boy in a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;What color coat had he said, again? He heard about riots and
battles, he heard about enough strange things seen in the sky or
the hills to populate the Blight. He heard that the Dragon Reborn
was about to descend on the city with thousands of men who could
channel, that the Aiel were coming, an army of Aes Sedai&mdash;no,
it was an army of Whitecloaks; Pedron Niall was dead, and the
Children intended to avenge him, though why in Ebou Dar was not
exactly clear. You might have thought the city would be hip-deep in
panic with all the tales floating around, but the fact was, even
those who told a tale usually only half-believed it. So he heard
all sorts of nonsense, but not a word about any boy in a red
coat.</p>

<p>A few streets from the river, he began hearing
thunder, great hollow booms that seemed to roll in from the sea.
People looked up curiously at the cloudless sky, scratched their
heads, and went on about their business. So did he, questioning
every seller of sweets or fruit he saw, and every pretty woman
afoot. All to no avail. Reaching the long stone quay that ran the
whole length of the river side of the city, he paused, studying the
gray docks stretching out into the river and the ships tied to
them. The wind blew strong, heaving vessels at their mooring lines,
grinding them against the stone docks despite the bags stuffed with
wool hung down between for fenders. Unlike horses, ships did not
interest Olver except as a way to go from here to there, and ships
were men&rsquo;s business in Ebou Dar even if the lading they
carried often was not. Women on these docks would either be
merchants keeping an eye on their goods or hard-armed members of
the cargo-loader&rsquo;s guild, and there would be no sweet-sellers
here.</p>

<p>About to turn away, he realized almost no one was
moving. The docks usually bustled, yet on every ship he could see,
crewmen lined the rails and had climbed into the rigging to stare
toward the bay. Barrels and crates stood abandoned while shirtless
men and wiry women in green leather vests crowded together at the
ends of the docks to peer between the ships, south, toward the
thunder. Down that way, black smoke rose in thick towering columns,
slanting sharply north on the wind.</p>

<p>Hesitating only a moment, he trotted out along the
nearest dock. At first, ships tied to the long fingers of stone to
the south blocked his view of anything except the smoke. Because of
the way the shoreline lay, though, each dock stuck out farther than
the next down; once he pushed into the murmuring crowd at the end,
the broad river made an open path of choppy green water to the
wave-tossed bay.</p>

<p>At least two dozen ships were burning out on the wide
expanse of the bay, maybe more, engulfed in flame from end to end.
A number of others had already settled, only a bow or stern still
above water and that sliding under. Even as he looked, the bow of a
broad two-masted ship flying a large banner of red and blue and
gold, the banner of Altara, suddenly flew apart with a roar, a boom
like thunder, and fast-thickening tendrils of smoke wafted away on
the wind as the vessel began settling by the head. Hundreds of
vessels were in motion, every craft in the bay, three-masted Sea
Folk rakers and skimmers and two-masted soarers, coastal ships with
their triangular sails, river ships under sail or sweep, some
fleeing upriver, most trying to beat out to sea. Scores of other
ships swanned into the bay before the wind, great bluff-bowed
vessels as tall as any of the rakers, crashing through the rolling
waves, throwing aside spray. His breath caught as he suddenly made
out square, ribbed sails.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blood and bloody ashes,&rdquo; he muttered in shock. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the flaming Seanchan!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; demanded a stern-faced woman crowded next to
him. A dark blue woolen dress of fine cut marked her a merchant as
much as did the leather folder she carried for her bills of lading
or the guild pin over one breast, a silver quill pen. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
the Aes Sedai,&rdquo; she announced in tones of conviction. &ldquo;I know
channeling when I see it. The Children of the Light will do for
them, just as soon as they arrive. You&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A lanky, gray-haired woman in a grimy green vest
twisted around to confront her, fingering the wooden hilt of her
dagger. &ldquo;Hold your tongue about Aes Sedai, you flaming
penny-grubber, or I&rsquo;ll peel you and stuff a Whitecloak down
your bleeding gullet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat left them waving their arms and shouting at one
another, and pushed clear of the crowd, running for the quay.
Already he could see three&mdash;no, four&mdash;huge creatures
circling over the city to the south on great pinions like those of
a bat. Figures clung to the creatures&rsquo; backs, apparently in
some sort of saddles. Another flying creature appeared, and more.
Below them, flame suddenly fountained above the rooftops with a
roar.</p>

<p>People ran now, buffeting Mat as he struggled through
the streets. &ldquo;Olver!&rdquo; he shouted, hoping to be heard above other
shouts from every side, and the screams. &ldquo;Olver!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly, everybody seemed to be heading the other
way, battering past him. Stubbornly he forced on against the tide.
And came to a street where what all those folk fled from was made
plain.</p>

<p>A Seanchan column rushed by, a hundred or more men in
helmets like insects&rsquo; heads and armor of overlapping plates,
all riding animals like cats the size of horses, but covered in
bronze scales rather than fur. Leaning forward in their saddles,
blue-streamered lances slanted, they galloped toward the Mol Hara
without looking to either side. Though &ldquo;gallop&rdquo; was not quite the
word for the way those creatures moved; the speed was right, but
they&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;flowed. It was time to be gone; past time. As soon as he
found&mdash;</p>

<p>As the end of column went by a flash of red, waist
high, caught his eye among the crowd in the street beyond the
intersection. &ldquo;Olver!&rdquo; He darted across almost on the heels of the
last scaled creature, pushing into the crowd in time to see a
wide-eyed woman snatch up a little girl in a red dress and ran with
the child clutched to her bosom. Wildly, Mat pressed ahead,
shouldering people aside when they Bumped into him, Bumping into
more than a few himself. &ldquo;Olver! Olver!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Twice more he saw a column of fire rise briefly above
the rooftops, and smoke drifted to the sky in a dozen places.
Several times he heard those booming roars, much closer than the
bay, now. Inside the city, he was sure; more than once the ground
quivered beneath his boots.</p>

<p>And then the street was clearing again, people
fleeing in every direction, down alleys and into houses and shops,
for Seanchan on horses were coming. Not all were armored men; near
the head of that small thicket of lances rode a dark woman in a
blue dress. Mat knew the large red panels on her skirts and bosom
were worked with silver lightning. A silver leash, gleaming in the
sun, ran from her left wrist to the neck of a woman in gray, a <em>damane</em>, who trotted beside the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>&rsquo;s
horse like a pet dog. He had seen more of Seanchan at Falme than he
wanted to, but unconsciously he paused at the mouth of an alleyway,
watching. The roars and fires had showed that somebody in the city
was trying to fight back, at least, and now he was going to see
such an attempt.</p>

<p>The Seanchan were not the only reason everyone else
had gotten out of sight. At the other end of the street, a good
hundred mounted men swung long-pointed lances down. They wore baggy
white breeches and green coats, and the gold cords on the
officer&rsquo;s helmet glittered. With a collective shout, a hundred
or more of Tylin&rsquo;s soldiers hurled themselves toward the
city&rsquo;s attackers. They outnumbered the Seanchan in front of
them by at least two to one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bloody fools,&rdquo; Mat muttered. &ldquo;Not like that. That
<em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The only movement among the Seanchan was the woman in
the lightning-marked dress raising her hand to point, as one might
launch a hawk, or send off a hound. The golden-haired woman at the
other end of the silvery leash took a small step forward. The
foxhead medallion cooled against his chest.</p>

<p>Underneath the head of the Ebou Dari charge, the
street suddenly erupted, paving stones and men and horses flying
into the air with a deafening roar. The concussion knocked Mat flat
on his back, or maybe it was the way the ground seemed to leap from
under his feet. He pulled himself up in time to see the front of an
inn across the way suddenly collapse into the street in a cloud of
dust, exposing the rooms within.</p>

<p>Men and horses lay everywhere, pieces of men and
horses, those still alive thrashing, around a hole in the ground
half as wide as the street. Screams from the wounded filled the
air. Fewer than half the Ebou Dari staggered to their feet, dazed
and stumbling. Some seized up the reins of horses as wobbly-legged
as they, heaving themselves into saddles, kicking the animals into
some semblance of a run. Others just ran afoot. All away from the
Seanchan. Steel they could face, but not this.</p>

<p>Running, Mat realized, seemed a particularly fine
idea right then. A glance back down the alley showed dust and
rubble piled at least a story high. He darted down the street ahead
of the fleeing Ebou Dari, keeping as close to the walls as
possible, hoping none of the Seanchan would think he was one of
Tylin&rsquo;s soldiers. He should never have worn a green coat.</p>

<p>The <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> apparently was not
satisfied. The foxhead went cool again, and from behind another
roar hammered him to the pavement, pavement that jumped up to meet
him. Through the ringing in his ears, he heard masonry groan. Above
him, the white-plastered brick wall began leaning outward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happened to my bloody luck?&rdquo; he shouted. He had
time for that. And just time to realize, as brick and timbers
crashed down on him, that the dice in his head had just stopped
dead.</p>
