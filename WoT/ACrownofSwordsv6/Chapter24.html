<h4><em>The Kin</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">I</span><em>ncredible</em>,
Reanne thought, watching from a
window as the two strange girls vanished down the street among the
tradesmen and beggars and occasional sedan chairs. She had returned
to the meeting room as soon as the pair was escorted from it. She
did not know what to make of them, and their persistent claims in
the face of all reason were only part of her confusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They did not perspire,&rdquo; Berowin whispered at her
shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; She would have arranged for the news to reach
the Tarasin Place in the next hour if she had not given her word.
And if not for the danger. Fear bubbled in her middle, the same
panic that had overtaken her after one passage through the silver
arches when she went to test for Accepted. Just as she had every
time it had stirred in the years since, she took a fresh grip on
herself; in truth, she did not realize that the fear she might run
screaming again had long since conquered any possibility that she
would. She prayed that those girls would abandon their insanity.
She prayed that if they did not, they were caught far from Ebou Dar
and either kept silent or were not believed. Precautions would have
to be taken, safeguards carried out that had not been used in
years. Aes Sedai were as near omnipotent as made no difference,
though. That, she knew in her bones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eldest, could it be possible that the older of the
two really is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? We channeled, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Berowin trailed off miserably, but Reanne did not
need to consider, not even setting aside the younger girl. Why
would any Aes Sedai pretend to be less, so much less? Besides, any
real Aes Sedai would have put them all on their knees begging
mercy, not stood there so submissively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We did not channel in front of an Aes Sedai,&rdquo; she
said firmly. &ldquo;We broke no rule.&rdquo; Those rules applied to her as
strictly as anyone else; the very first was that they were all one,
even those set above for a time. How could it have been otherwise,
when those who were above must eventually step down? Only through
movement and change could they remain hidden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But some of the rumors do mention a girl as Amyrlin,
Eldest. And she knew&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rebels.&rdquo; Reanne put into that all the outraged
disbelief she felt. That anyone should <em>dare</em> to rebel
against the White Tower! It was hardly strange for unbelievable
tales to attach to anyone like that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about Logain, and the Red Ajah?&rdquo; Garenia
demanded, and Reanne fixed her with a stare. The woman had gotten
herself another cup of tea before coming back up, and she managed
to sip defiantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever the truth, Garenia, it is not our place to
criticize anything Aes Sedai might do.&rdquo; Reanne&rsquo;s mouth
tightened. That hardly squared with what she felt toward the
rebels, but how could any Aes Sedai do such a thing?</p>

<p>The Saldaean bent her neck in acquiescence, though,
and perhaps to hide the sullen twist of her mouth. Reanne sighed.
She herself had given up dreams of the Green Ajah long long ago,
but there were those like Berowin who believed, secretly they
thought, that somehow they might one day return to the White Tower,
somehow yet become Aes Sedai. And then there were women like
Garenia, almost as poor at keeping their wishes secret, though
those wishes were ten times as forbidden. They actually would have
accepted wilders, and even gone out to find girls who could be
taught!</p>

<p>Garenia was not done; she always skirted the edges of
discipline, and frequently stepped over. &ldquo;What of this Setalle
Anan, then? Those girls know about the Circle. The Anan woman must
have told them, though how she knows&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She shuddered in a way
that would have been entirely too ostentatious for most others, but
she had never been able to conceal her emotions. Even when she
should. &ldquo;Whoever betrayed us to her must be found, and her betrayal
punished too. She&rsquo;s an innkeeper, and she must be taught to
guard her tongue!&rdquo; Berowin gasped, wide-eyed with shock, and
dropped into a chair so hard she nearly bounced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember who she is, Garenia,&rdquo; Reanne said sharply. &ldquo;If Setalle had betrayed us, we would be crawling to Tar Valon,
begging forgiveness the whole way.&rdquo; When she first came to Ebou
Dar, she had been told the story of a woman made to crawl to the
White Tower, and nothing she had seen since of Aes Sedai made her
question it in the least. &ldquo;She has kept the few secrets she knows
from gratitude, and I doubt that has faded. She would have died in
her first childbirth if the Kin had not helped her. What she knows
comes from careless tongues, when it was thought she could not
hear, and the owners of those tongues were punished more than
twenty years ago.&rdquo; Still, she wished there was some way she could
bring herself to ask Setalle to be more circumspect. She must have
spoken carelessly in front of those girls.</p>

<p>The woman bowed her head again, but her mouth was set
stubbornly. At least part of this turn, Reanne decided, Garenia
would spend at the retreat, and she would have special instructions
to relay with her own stubborn mouth. Alise seldom required more
than a week to make a woman decide stubbornness did not pay.</p>

<p>Before she could inform Garenia, though, Derys was
curtsying in the doorway, announcing Sarainya Vostovan. As usual,
Sarainya swept right in before Reanne could say to admit her. In
some ways, the strikingly handsome woman made Garenia appear
supple, despite keeping the form of every rule exactly. Reanne was
sure she would have worn her hair in braids and bells given the
choice, and never mind how that would have looked with her red
belt. But then, given the choice she would not have served even one
turn with the belt.</p>

<p>Sarainya did curtsy at the door, of course, and kneel
before her, head lowered, but fifty years had not made her forget
that she would have been a woman of considerable power had she been
able to make herself return home to Arafel. Curtsy and the rest all
were concessions. When she spoke, in that husky, forceful voice,
whether the woman would ever reconcile herself and the problem of
Garenia left Reanne&rsquo;s mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Callie is dead, Eldest Sister. Her throat was cut
and she apparently had been robbed even of her stockings, but
Sumeko says that it was the One Power killed her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is impossible!&rdquo; Berowin burst out. &ldquo;No
Kinswoman would do such a thing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An Aes Sedai?&rdquo; Garenia said, hesitant for once. &ldquo;But
how? The Three Oaths. Sumeko must be wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reanne raised a hand for silence. Sumeko was never
wrong, not in this area. She would have been Yellow Ajah had she
not broken down completely while testing for the shawl, and
although it was forbidden, despite countless penances, she worked
to learn more whenever she thought no one was watching. No Aes
Sedai could have done this, obviously, and no Kinswoman would have,
but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Those girls, so insistent, knowing what they should not.
The Circle had lasted too long, offered succor to too many women,
to be destroyed now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is what must be done,&rdquo; she told them. That
flutter of fear began again, but for once she hardly noticed.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Nynaeve stalked away from the small house in outrage.
It was incredible! Those women did have a guild; she knew they did!
Whatever they said, she was sure they knew where the Bowl was, too.
She would have done whatever was necessary to bring them to tell
her. Pretending docility before them for a few hours would have
been a deal easier than putting up with Mat Cauthon for the Light
knew how many days.</p>

<p><em>I could have been as acquiescent as they
wanted</em>, she thought irritably. <em>They&rsquo;d have thought I
was a pliable old slipper! I could have</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;That was a lie,
and it did not take a foul, remembered taste to convince her. Given
half a chance, she would have shaken every one of those women till
they told her what she wanted to know. She would have given them
Aes Sedai till they squeaked!</p>

<p>She scowled sideways at Elayne. The other woman
seemed lost in thought. Nynaeve wished she did not know what the
woman was thinking about. A wasted morning, and not far short of
complete humiliation. She did not like being in the wrong. She was
not yet used to admitting she was, really. And now she was going to
have to apologize to Elayne. She <em>truly</em> hated apologizing. Well, it
would be bad enough back in their rooms. With Birgitte and Aviendha
still out, it was to be hoped. She was not about to begin in the
street, with who knew who streaming by. The throng had thickened,
though the sun hardly seemed much higher through the wheeling
clouds of seabirds that cried overhead.</p>

<p>Finding their way was not easy, after all those
twists and turns. Nynaeve had to ask directions half a dozen times,
while Elayne stared in another direction, pretending indifference.
She stalked along across bridges, ducked around wagons and carts,
jumped out of the way of racing sedan chairs that wove through the
crowds, wished Elayne would say something. Nynaeve knew how to
nurse a grudge, and the longer she herself kept silent, the worse
it was when she spoke, so the longer Elayne walked without
speaking, the darker became the image in her mind of how it was
going to be back in their rooms. That made her furious. She had
admitted she was wrong, if only to herself. Elayne had no right to
make her suffer this way. She began wearing such a face that even
people who did not notice their rings gave them a clear path.
People who did notice usually seemed to find an urgent need to be a
street away. Even some sedan-chair bearers skirted around her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How old did Reanne look to you?&rdquo; Elayne asked
suddenly. Nynaeve nearly jumped. They were almost back to Mol
Hara.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fifty years. Maybe sixty. I don&rsquo;t see it
matters.&rdquo; She ran her eyes over the crowd to see if anyone was
close enough to hear. A passing hawker, her tray displaying a
bitter little yellow fruit called a lemon, tried to swallow her cry
in mid-shout when Nynaeve&rsquo;s gaze rested on her for a moment,
with the result that she doubled over her tray coughing and
choking. Nynaeve sniffed. The woman probably had been
eavesdropping, if not planning to cut a purse. &ldquo;They <em>are</em> a
guild, Elayne, and they <em>do</em> know where the Bowl is. I just
know they do.&rdquo; That was not what she had intended to say at all. If
she apologized for dragging Elayne into this now, maybe it would
not be so bad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose they are,&rdquo; Elayne said absently. &ldquo;I
suppose they might. How is it that she can have aged so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve stopped dead in the middle street. After all
that arguing, after getting them thrown out, she <em>supposed</em>? &ldquo;Well, <em>I</em> suppose she aged the same way as the rest of us,
a day at a time. Elayne, if you believed, why did you announce who
you were like Rhiannon at the Tower?&rdquo; She rather liked that;
according to the story, what Queen Rhiannon got was far from what
she had wanted.</p>

<p>The question did not seem to register with Elayne,
for all her education. She pulled Nynaeve to one side as a
curtained green carriage rumbled past&mdash;the street was not
very wide there&mdash;over to the front of a seamstress&rsquo;s
shop with a wide doorway showing several dressmaker&rsquo;s forms
clothed in half-done dresses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were not going to tell us anything, Nynaeve,
not if you got down on your knees and begged.&rdquo; Nynaeve opened her
mouth indignantly, then snapped it shut. She had never said
anything about begging. Anyway, why should she have been the only
one? Better any woman at all than Mat Cauthon. Elayne had a fly up
her nose, though, and was not to be distracted. &ldquo;Nynaeve, she must
have slowed like everyone else. How old is she, to look fifty or
sixty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; Without thinking
Nynaeve noted the location in a corner of her mind; the
seamstress&rsquo;s work looked quite good, worth closer examination. &ldquo;She probably doesn&rsquo;t channel any more than she can help,
afraid as she is of being mistaken for a sister. She wouldn&rsquo;t
have wanted her face too smooth, after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never listened in class, did you?&rdquo; Elayne
murmured. She saw the plump seamstress beaming in the doorway, and
drew Nynaeve toward the corner of the building. Considering the
amount of lace the seamstress wore on her own dress, the bodice
buried in it and paces of it drooping over her exposed petticoats,
she would bear close watching if Nynaeve did order anything. &ldquo;Forget clothes for one moment, Nynaeve. Who is the oldest Accepted
you remember?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave Elayne a very level look. The woman made it
sound as if she never thought of anything else! And she had too
listened. Sometimes. &ldquo;Elin Warrel, I think. She&rsquo;s about my
age, I think.&rdquo; Of course, the seamstress&rsquo;s own dress would
look fine with a more modest neckline and much less lace. In green
silk. Lan liked green, though she certainly was not going to choose
her dresses for him. He liked blue, as well.</p>

<p>Elayne barked such a laugh that Nynaeve wondered
whether she had spoken aloud. Coloring fiercely, she tried to
explain&mdash;she was sure she could; by Bel Tine&mdash;but the
other woman gave her no opportunity for a word. &ldquo;Elin&rsquo;s sister
came to visit her just before you first arrived at the Tower,
Nynaeve. Her <em>younger</em> sister. The woman had <em>gray</em>
hair. Well, some of it was. She must have been over <em>forty</em>,
Nynaeve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elin Warrel was past forty? But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;! &ldquo;What are you
saying, Elayne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one was close enough to listen, and no one seemed
to be giving them a second glance except the still hopeful
seamstress, but Elayne lowered her voice to a whisper. &ldquo;We <em>slow</em>, Nynaeve. Somewhere between twenty and twenty-five, we
begin aging more slowly. How much depends on how strong we are, but
when doesn&rsquo;t. Any woman who can channel does it. Takima said
she thought it was the beginning of achieving the ageless look,
though I don&rsquo;t think anyone has ever reached that until
they&rsquo;ve worn the shawl at least a year or two, sometimes five
or more. Think. You <em>know</em> any sister with gray hair is <em>old</em>, even if you aren&rsquo;t supposed to mention it. So if
Reanne slowed, and she must have, how old is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve did not care how old Reanne was. She wanted
to cry. No wonder everyone refused to believe her age. It explained
why the Women&rsquo;s Circle back home had looked over her shoulder
as if unsure she was old enough to be trusted fully. Achieving a
sister&rsquo;s ageless face was all very well, but how long before
she had her gray hairs?</p>

<p>Blinking, she turned away angrily. And something
struck her a glancing blow on the back of the head. Staggering, she
rounded on Elayne in astonishment. Why had the woman hit her? Only,
Elayne lay in a heap, eyes closed and a nasty purple lump rising on
her temple. Groggily, Nynaeve fell to her knees and gathered her
friend into her arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your friend must be taken ill,&rdquo; a long nosed woman
said, kneeling beside them, careless of a yellow dress that showed
far too much bosom even by Ebou Dari standards. &ldquo;Let me help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A tall fellow, handsome in his embroidered silk vest
except for a rather oily grin, bent to take Nynaeve&rsquo;s
shoulders. &ldquo;Here, I have a carriage. We&rsquo;ll take you somewhere
more comfortable than a paving stone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; Nynaeve told them politely. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
need your help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man kept trying to raise her to her feet, though,
to guide her toward a red carriage, where a startled-appearing
woman in blue beckoned vigorously. The long-nosed woman actually
tried to lift Elayne, thanking the man for his help and chattering
how his carriage sounded a fine idea. A crowd of onlookers seemed
to have gathered out of air in a semicircle, women murmuring
sympathy about fainting from the heat, men offering to help carry
the ladies. A scrawny fellow, bold as you please, reached for
Nynaeve&rsquo;s purse almost right under her nose.</p>

<p>Her head still swam enough to make embracing <em>saidar</em> difficult, but if all those nattering folk had not
fueled her temper, what she saw lying in the street would have. An
arrow with a blunt stone head. The one that had grazed her or the
one that had struck Elayne. She channeled, and the scrawny cutpurse
doubled over, clutching himself and squealing like a pig in briars.
Another flow, and the long-nosed woman fell over backward with a
shriek twice as high. The man in the silk vest apparently decided
they did not need his help after all, because he turned and ran for
the carriage, but she gave him a dose anyway. He out-bellowed any
outraged bull as the woman in the carriage hauled him in by his
vest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, but we don&rsquo;t need any help,&rdquo;
Nynaeve shouted. Politely.</p>

<p>Few remained to hear. Once it became clear that the
One Power was being used&mdash;and folk suddenly leaping about and
yelling for no visible cause made it clear enough to most&mdash;they hurried elsewhere. The long-nosed woman gathered herself up
and actually jumped onto the back of the red carriage, clinging
precariously as the dark-vested driver whipped the horses away
through the crowd, people leaping aside. Even the cutpurse hobbled
off as fast as he could.</p>

<p>Nynaeve could not have cared less had the earth
opened and swallowed the whole lot. Chest aching, she ran fine
flows of Wind and Water, Earth, Fire and Spirit mixed and blended,
through Elayne. It was a simple weave, no bother despite her faint
dizziness, and the result let her breathe again. The bruise was not
serious; the bones of Elayne&rsquo;s skull were unbroken. Normally,
she would have redirected those same flows into much more complex
weaves, the Healing she had discovered herself. At the moment,
simpler weaves were all she could manage, though. With just Spirit,
Wind and Water, she wove the Healing that Yellows had used since
time immemorial.</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s eyes shot open wide, and with a gasp
that seemed to take all the air in her, she convulsed like a netted
trout, slippered heels drumming on the pavement. That only lasted a
moment, of course, but in that moment the bruise shrank and
vanished.</p>

<p>Nynaeve helped her to her feet&mdash;and a
woman&rsquo;s hand appeared, holding a pewter cup full of water. &ldquo;Even an Aes Sedai might be thirsty after that,&rdquo; the seamstress
said.</p>

<p>Elayne reached for it, but Nynaeve laid fingers on
her wrist. &ldquo;No, thank you.&rdquo; The woman shrugged, and as she turned
away, Nynaeve added in a different tone, &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; It seemed to
come easier the more you said it; she was not sure she liked
that.</p>

<p>That ocean of lace heaved as the seamstress shrugged
again. &ldquo;I make dresses for anyone. I can do better for your
coloring than that.&rdquo; She vanished back into her shop. Nynaeve
frowned after her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Elayne demanded. &ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t
you let me take a drink? I&rsquo;m thirsty <em>and</em> hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a last frown for the seamstress, Nynaeve bent to
pick up the arrow.</p>

<p>The other woman needed no explanations. <em>Saidar</em> shone around her in a flash. &ldquo;Teslyn and Joline?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve shook her head; the slight wooziness seemed
to be fading. She did not think those two would stoop to this. She
did not think so. &ldquo;What about Reanne?&rdquo; she said quietly. The
seamstress was back in the doorway, still hopeful. &ldquo;She might want
to make sure we leave. Or worse, maybe Garenia.&rdquo; That was almost as
chilling as Teslyn and Joline. And twice as infuriating.</p>

<p>Somehow Elayne managed to look pretty while scowling. &ldquo;Whoever it was, we will settle them. You&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo; The scowl
faded. &ldquo;Nynaeve, if the Circle does know where the Bowl is, we can
find it, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She bit her lip, hesitating. &ldquo;I only know one
way to be sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve nodded slowly, though she would rather have
eaten a handful of dirt. Today had seemed so bright for a time, but
then it had spiraled into darkness, from Reanne to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Oh, Light,
how long before she had her gray hair?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, Nynaeve. Mat can&rsquo;t possibly be
that bad. He&rsquo;ll find it for us in a few days, I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve only cried harder.</p>
