<h4><em>A Note from the Palace</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
day after the Festival of Birds dawned to strong
winds off the Sea of Storms that actually cut the heat in Ebou Dar.
A sky without a cloud and the red-gold dome of the sun on the
horizon gave promises for once the wind died, though. Mat hurried
down through the Tarasin Palace with his green coat undone and his
shirt only half-laced in anticipation. He did not quite jump at
every sound, but he did give a start, considerably more wide-eyed
than he liked, whenever one of the serving women passed, swishing
her petticoats and smiling at him. Every last one of them smiled,
in a particularly&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;knowing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;way. It was all he could do
not to run.</p>

<p>At the last, he slowed, easing onto the shaded walk
bordering the stableyard almost on tiptoe. Between the fluted
columns of the walk, yellowish reedy plants in big red pottery
bowls and vines with wide, red-striped leaves dangling from metal
baskets on chains formed a thin screen. Unconsciously, he tugged
his hat lower to obscure his face.</p>

<p>His hands ran along his spear&mdash;an <em>ashandarei</em>, Birgitte called it&mdash;unthinkingly fingering
the haft as if he might need to defend himself. The dice tumbled
inside his head fiercely, yet that had nothing to do with his
uneasiness. The source of that was Tylin.</p>

<p>Six closed coaches with the green Anchor and Sword of
House Mitsobar lacquered on the doors already waited in line before
the tall arched outer gates with teams hitched and liveried drivers
mounted. He could see Nalesean yawning in a yellow-striped coat on
the far side of them, and Vanin sat slumped atop an upended barrel
not far from the stable doors, apparently asleep. Most of the other
Redarms were squatting patiently on the stableyard flagstones; a
few tossed dice in the shadow of the huge white stables. Elayne
stood between Mat and the coaches, just the other side of the
screen of plants. Reanne Corly was with her, and close by, seven
more of the women who were at that peculiar meeting he had burst
into the evening before; Reanne was the only one not wearing the
red belt of a Wise Woman. He had half-expected them not to appear
this morning. They had the features of women used to ordering their
own lives and other&rsquo;s, and most had at least a bit of gray in
their hair, yet they watched fresh-faced Elayne with an air of
expectation, seemingly on their toes, as though ready to jump at
her command. The whole lot caught less than half his attention,
though; none of them was the woman who had him ready to jump out of
his skin. Tylin made him feel&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;helpless was the
only word that seemed to fit, however ridiculous it seemed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do not need them, Mistress Corly,&rdquo; Elayne said.
The Daughter-Heir sounded like a woman patting a child on the head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told them to remain here until we return. We will
attract less attention, especially across the river, without anyone
recognizably Aes Sedai.&rdquo; Her notion of what to wear visiting the
roughest part of the city without attracting attention was a wide
green hat with green-dyed plumes, a light dustcloak of green linen
worked in golden scrolls hanging down her back, and a high-necked
green silk riding dress with gold embroidery climbing the divided
skirts and thickly emphasizing the oval that exposed half her
bosom. She even wore one of those necklaces for a marriage knife.
That broad band of woven gold would make every thief&rsquo;s hand in
the Rahad itch. She carried no weapon beyond a small belt knife.
But as to that, what weapon did a woman who could channel need? Of
course, every one of those red belts had a curved dagger tucked
behind it. So did Reane&rsquo;s belt of plain worked leather.</p>

<p>Reanne removed a large blue straw hat, frowned at it,
then put it back on and retied the ribbons. Elayne&rsquo;s tone did
not seem to be what was bothering her. She put on a diffident smile
with the hat, and a timid tone. &ldquo;But why does Merilille Sedai think
we are lying, Elayne Sedai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They all do,&rdquo; one of the red-belts said
breathlessly. All of them wore Ebou Dari dresses in sober colors,
with narrow plunging necklines and skirts sewn up on one side to
expose layered petticoats, but only this one, bone-lean and with
more white than black in her long hair, had the olive skin and dark
eyes of an Ebou Dari. &ldquo;Sareitha Sedai called me liar to my face,
about our numbers, about&mdash;&rdquo; She cut off short at a frown and
a &ldquo;Be quiet, Tamarla&rdquo; from Reanne; Mistress Corly might be ready to
curtsy and simper for a child if the child was Aes Sedai, but she
kept a tight rein on her companions.</p>

<p>Mat frowned up at the windows overlooking the
stable-yard, those he could see from where he stood. Elaborate
white wrought-iron screens covered some, white wooden screens of
intricately carved piercework others. Not likely Tylin was up
there; not likely she would appear in the stableyard. He had been
very careful not to wake her getting dressed. Besides, she would
not try anything here. At least, he did not think she would. Then
again, was anything past the woman who had had half a dozen serving
women seize him in the halls last night and drag him into her
apartments? The bloody woman treated him like a toy! He
was not going to put up with it anymore. He was not. Light, who was
he trying to fool? If they did not grab this Bowl of the Winds and
get out of Ebou Dar, Tylin would be pinching his bottom and calling
him her little pigeon again tonight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your ages, Reanne.&rdquo; Elayne did not exactly
sound hesitant&mdash;she never did that&mdash;but her tone became
very careful. &ldquo;It is considered rude among Aes Sedai to speak of
age, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Reanne, apparently no Aes Sedai since the Breaking
has lived as long as any of you in the Knitting Circle claim.&rdquo; That
was the odd name these Kin gave their ruling council. &ldquo;In your own
case, not by over a hundred years.&rdquo; The red-belts gasped, going
wide-eyed. A slender brown-eyed woman with pale honey hair gave a
nervous giggle and instantly covered her mouth at Reanne&rsquo;s
whip-quick &ldquo;Famelle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That can&rsquo;t be possible,&rdquo; Reanne said faintly to
Elayne. &ldquo;Surely, Aes Sedai must&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; Mat said, stepping past the screen of
plants. The whole discussion was idiotic; everyone knew Aes Sedai
lived longer than anybody else. Instead of wasting time, they
should be on their way to the Rahad. &ldquo;Where are Thom and Juilin?
And Nynaeve.&rdquo; She had to have come back last night, or Elayne would
have been in a swivet. &ldquo;Blood and ashes, I don&rsquo;t see Birgitte
either. We need, to be on our way, Elayne, not standing around. Is
Aviendha coming?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She frowned at him slightly, with just a flicker of
her eyes toward Reanne, and he knew she was deciding what
performance to give him. Wide-eyed innocence might damage her
standing with these women as much as flashing her dimple at him
would; Elayne always expected that dimple to work where all else
failed. Her chin rose slightly. &ldquo;Thom and Juilin are helping
Aviendha and Birgitte watch Carridin&rsquo;s palace, Mat.&rdquo; It was to
be the Daughter-Heir in near full-bloom. Not the whole flowering,
since she surely knew how he would react to that, but a voice full
of certainty, cool blue eyes demanding, and that pretty face chill
if not exactly frozen with arrogance. Was there any woman in the
world who was just one person? &ldquo;Nynaeve will be down shortly,
I&rsquo;m sure. There is no reason for you to come, you know, Mat.
Nalesean and your soldiers are a more than adequate bodyguard. You
could enjoy yourself right here in the palace until we return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carridin!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Elayne, we aren&rsquo;t staying
in Ebou Dar to settle Jaichim Carridin. We are getting the Bowl,
then you or Nynaeve is going to make a gateway, and we are leaving.
Is that clear? And I&rsquo;m going with you to the Rahad.&rdquo; Enjoy
himself! The Light only knew what Tylin would get up to if he
remained in the palace all day. The very thought made him want to
laugh hysterically.</p>

<p>Icy stares stabbed at him from the Wise Women; stout
Sumeko pursed her lips angrily, and Melore, a plump Domani in her
middle years whose bosom he had enjoyed eyeing yesterday, planted
fists on hips with a face like a thunderhead. They should have
known from yesterday that he was not intimidated by Aes Sedai, yet
even Reanne gave him such a scowl he half thought she might try to
box his ears. Apparently, if they were going to fall all over
themselves around Aes Sedai, then everybody else had to as
well.</p>

<p>Elayne struggled with herself visibly. Her lips
compressed, but one thing he had to give her; she was too smart to
go on with what obviously would not work. On the other hand, she
was snooty to the bone however she tried. And the other women were
watching. &ldquo;Mat, you know we cannot leave until we have used the
Bowl.&rdquo; That haughty chin remained high, and her tone was at best
halfway between explaining and telling. &ldquo;It might require days for
us to be sure of how to use it, perhaps even half a week or more,
and we might as well finish Carridin if we can in that time.&rdquo; Such
a crackle entered her voice on the Whitecloak&rsquo;s name that you
might have thought she bore the man a personal grudge, but
something else leaped out and clamped a fist on his thoughts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Half a week!&rdquo; Feeling strangled, he put a finger
behind the scarf knotted around his neck and tugged to ease it.
Tylin had used that length of black silk to tie his hands last
night before he knew what she was doing. Half a week. Or more!
Despite his best efforts, his voice became a touch frantic. &ldquo;Elayne, surely you can use the Bowl anywhere. It doesn&rsquo;t have
to be here. Egwene must want you back as soon as possible; she can
use a friend or two, I&rsquo;ll wager.&rdquo; By the last he had seen, she
could use a few hundred. Maybe once he got these women back, Egwene
would be ready to give up that nonsense about being Amyrlin and let
him take her to Rand along with Elayne and Nynaeve and Aviendha. &ldquo;And what about Rand, Elayne? Caemlyn. The Lion Throne. Blood and
ashes, you know you want to reach Caemlyn quick as you can so Rand
can give you the Lion Throne.&rdquo; For some reason, her face grew
darker almost by the word, and her eyes flashed. He would have said
she was indignant, except of course that she had no cause.</p>

<p>She opened her mouth angrily to argue as soon as he
finished, and he set himself, ready to list her promises and to the
Pit of Doom with what that did to her in the eyes of Reanne and the
rest. By their faces, they would have snubbed him short already in
her place.</p>

<p>Before anyone could say anything, though, a round
graying woman in House Mitsobar livery was curtsying, first to
Elayne, then to the women wearing red belts, and finally to him. &ldquo;Queen Tylin sends this, Master Cauthon,&rdquo; Laren said, holding out a
basket with a striped cloth over the contents and small red flowers
woven around the handle. &ldquo;You did not breakfast, and you must
maintain your strength.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat&rsquo;s cheeks warmed. The woman merely looked at
him, but she had seen considerably more of him than when she first
showed him into Tylin&rsquo;s presence. Considerably more. She had
brought supper on a tray last night, while he tried to hide under
the silk bedsheet. He did not understand it. These women had him
jumping about and blushing like a girl. He just could not
understand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you wouldn&rsquo;t rather remain here?&rdquo;
Elayne asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Tylin would enjoy your company for
breakfast. The Queen said she finds you wonderfully entertaining
and courteously compliant,&rdquo; she added in a doubtful tone.</p>

<p>Mat fled for the coaches with the basket in one hand
and his <em>ashandarei</em> in the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are all northern men so shy?&rdquo; Laren said.</p>

<p>He risked a glance over his shoulder without
stopping, and heaved a sigh of relief. The serving woman was
already gathering her skirts, turning to walk though the screen of
plants, and Elayne was motioning Reanne and the Wise Women into a
circle close around her. Even so, he shivered. Women were going to
be the death of him yet.</p>

<p>Rounding the nearest coach, he nearly dropped the
basket at the sight of Beslan seated on the coach step, sunlight
gleaming along the narrow blade of his sword as he examined the
edge. &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; Mat exclaimed.</p>

<p>Beslan slid the sword into its sheath, a grin
splitting his face. &ldquo;Coming with you to the Rahad. I suspect
you&rsquo;ll find more fun for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There had better be some fun,&rdquo; Nalesean yawned into
his hand. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get very much sleep last night, and now
you drag me off when there are Sea Folk women about.&rdquo; Vanin sat up
on his barrel, looked around, found nothing moving, and settled
himself back again with his eyes shut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no <em>fun</em> if I can help it,&rdquo;
Mat muttered. <em>Nalesean</em> had not gotten much sleep? Hah! The
whole lot of them had been out enjoying themselves at the festival.
Not that he had not enjoyed himself in patches, but only when he
could forget he was with a woman who thought he was some sort of
bloody doll. &ldquo;What Sea Folk women?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When Nynaeve Sedai returned last night, she brought
a dozen or more, Mat.&rdquo; Beslan blew out his breath, and his hands
made swaying motions. &ldquo;The way they move, Mat&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat shook his head. He was not thinking clearly;
Tylin was scrambling his brains. Nynaeve and Elayne had told him
about the Windfinders, reluctantly and in sworn secrecy, after
trying to hold back even where Nynaeve wanted to go, much less why.
And not a single blush at the effort, either. &ldquo;Women keep promises
in their own way,&rdquo; so the saying went. Come to think of it, Lawtin
and Belvyn were not with the rest of the Redarms. Maybe Nynaeve
thought to make up for the other by keeping them with her now. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;In their own way.&rdquo; But if she had the Windfinders already in
the palace, surely it would not take half a week to use the Bowl.
Light, please not!</p>

<p>As if thinking of her had been a summons, Nynaeve
came strolling through the screen of plants into the stable-yard.
Mat&rsquo;s jaw dropped. The tall man in a dark green coat on her
arm was Lan! Or rather, she was on his, clinging to it with both
hands, smiling up at him. With any other woman, Mat would have said
she was moon-eyed and dreaming, but this was Nynaeve.</p>

<p>She gave a start once she realized where she was, and
took a hasty step to one side, though she still held on to
Lan&rsquo;s hand for a moment. Her choice of dresses was no better
than Elayne&rsquo;s, all blue silk and green embroidery, cut low
enough to show a heavy gold ring that would have rattled on her two
thumbs together, dangling into her cleavage on a thin gold chain.
The wide hat she carried by its ribbons was trimmed with blue
plumes, her dustcloak green linen embroidered in blue. She and
Elayne made the other women drab by comparison in their
woolens.</p>

<p>In any case, whether or not she had been calf-eyes a
moment before, she was all herself now, shifting her braid around. &ldquo;Join the other men now, Lan,&rdquo; she said peremptorily, &ldquo;and we can
go. The last four coaches are for the men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you say,&rdquo; Lan replied, bowing with a hand on his
sword hilt.</p>

<p>She watched him stride toward Mat with an expression
of wonder, probably unable to believe he was obeying so meekly,
then gave herself a shake and recovered her bristly self again.
Gathering up Elayne and the other women, she herded them toward the
first two coaches like a woman shooing geese. By the way she
shouted for someone to open the stableyard gates, no one would have
known she had been the one delaying their departure. She shouted at
the drivers, too, setting them to snatching up their reins and
flourishing their long whips; it was a marvel they waited for
anyone to climb aboard.</p>

<p>Scrambling awkwardly after Lan and Nalesean and
Beslan into the third coach, Mat propped his spear across the door
and sat down hard with the basket on his lap as the coach lurched
forward. &ldquo;Where did you come from, Lan?&rdquo; he burst out as soon as
introductions were out of the way. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the last man I
expected to see. Where have you been? Light, I thought you were
dead. I know Rand&rsquo;s afraid you are. And letting Nynaeve order
you around. Why in the Light would you do that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stone-faced Warder seemed to consider which
question to answer. &ldquo;Nynaeve and I were married last night by the
Mistress of the Ships,&rdquo; he said finally. &ldquo;The Atha&rsquo;an Miere
have several&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;unusual&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;marriage customs. There were
surprises for both of us.&rdquo; A small smile touched his mouth, if
nothing else. He shrugged slightly; seemingly that was all the
answer he intended to give.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The blessing of the Light be upon you and your
bride,&rdquo; Beslan murmured politely with as much of a bow as the
confines of the coach would allow, and Nalesean mumbled something,
though it was plain from his expression that he thought Lan must be
mad. Nalesean had had a good bit of Nynaeve&rsquo;s company.</p>

<p>Mat just sat there swaying with the coach&rsquo;s
motion and staring. Nynaeve <em>married</em>? <em>Lan</em> married
to <em>Nynaeve</em>? The man <em>was</em> mad. No wonder his eyes
looked so bleak. Mat would as soon have stuffed a rabid fox down
his own shirt. Only a fool married, and only a madman would marry
Nynaeve.</p>

<p>If Lan noticed that not everyone was overjoyed, he
gave no sign. Except for his eyes, he looked no different than Mat
remembered. Maybe a little harder, if that was possible. &ldquo;There is
something more important,&rdquo; Lan said. &ldquo;Nynaeve doesn&rsquo;t want you
to know, Mat, but you need to hear it. Your two men are dead,
killed by Moghedien. I am sorry, but if it is any consolation, they
truly were dead before they knew. Nynaeve thinks Moghedien must be
gone, or she&rsquo;d have tried again, but I am not so certain. It
seems she has a personal enmity toward Nynaeve, although Nynaeve
managed to avoid telling me why.&rdquo; Again the smile; Lan seemed
unaware of it. &ldquo;Not all of it, at least, and it does not matter.
Best you know what might be facing us beyond the river,
though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moghedien,&rdquo; Beslan breathed, eyes shining. The man
was probably seeing <em>fun</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moghedien,&rdquo; Nalesean breathed, but in his case, it
was more of a groan, and he gave his pointed beard a fitful
jerk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those bloody flaming women,&rdquo; Mat muttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t include my wife,&rdquo; Lan said
coldly, one hand gripping the hilt of his sword, and Mat quickly
raised his own hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not. Just Elayne and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and the
Kin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a moment, Lan nodded, and Mat breathed a small
sigh of relief. It would be just like Nynaeve to get him killed by
her husband&mdash;her husband!&mdash;when sure as bread was
brown, she would have hidden the fact that one of the Forsaken
might be in the city. Even Moghedien did not really frighten him,
not so long as he had the foxhead around his neck, but the
medallion could not protect Nalesean or any of the rest. No doubt
Nynaeve thought she and Elayne would do that. They let him bring
along the Redarms, all the while laughing up their sleeves at him
while they&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to read my mother&rsquo;s note,
Mat?&rdquo; Until Beslan mentioned it, he had not realized there was a
sheet of paper, folded small, tucked in between the basket and the
striped cloth. Just enough showed to reveal the green seal
impressed with the Anchor and Sword.</p>

<p>He broke the wax with his thumb and unfolded the
page, holding it so Beslan could not see what was written. As well
he did; or then again, considering how the other man saw things,
maybe it did not matter. Either way, Mat was just as glad no eyes
but his saw those words. His heart sank deeper by the line.</p>

<p class="note">Mat, my sweet,</p>

<p class="note">I am having your things moved to my apartments. So much more
convenient. By the time you return, Riselle will be in your old
rooms to look after young Olver. He seems to enjoy her company.</p>

<p class="note">I have seamstresses coming to measure you. I will enjoy watching
that. You must wear shorter coats. And new breeches, of course. You
have a delightful bottom. Duckling, who is this Daughter of the
Nine Moons I made you think of? I have thought of several delicious
ways to make you tell me.</p>

<p class="note_sig">Tylin</p>

<p>The others were all looking at him expectantly. Well,
Lan was simply looking, but his gaze was more unnerving than the
rest; that stare seemed almost&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Queen thinks I need new clothes,&rdquo; Mat said,
stuffing the note into his coat pocket. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll take a
nap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pulled the brim of his hat down over his eyes, but
he did not close them, staring out the window, where the tied-back
curtain let in occasional eddies of dust. It also let in the wind,
though, which was considerably better than the heat of a closed
coach.</p>

<p>Moghedien and Tylin. Of the two, he would rather
confront Moghedien. He touched the foxhead hanging in the open neck
of his shirt. At least he had some protection against Moghedien.
Against Tylin, he had no more than he did against the Daughter of
the bloody Nine Moons, whoever she was. Unless he could find some
way to make Nynaeve and Elayne leave Ebou Dar before tonight,
everybody was going to know. Sullenly, he tugged his hat lower.
These flaming women really were making him act like a girl. In
another minute, he was afraid he might just start crying.</p>
