<h4><em>The Triumph of Logic</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">M</span>at
stalked out of the palace when Tylin finally let
him go, and had he thought it would do any good, he would have run.
The skin between his shoulder blades prickled so, he almost forgot
the dice dancing in his head. The worst moment&mdash;the very
worst of a dozen bad&mdash;had been when Beslan teased his mother,
saying she should find herself a pretty for the balls, and Tylin
laughingly claimed a queen had no time for young men, all the while
looking at Mat with those bloody eagle&rsquo;s eyes. Now he knew why
rabbits ran so fast. He stumped across Mol Hara Square not seeing
anything. Had Nynaeve and Elayne been cavorting with Jaichim
Carridin and Elaida in the fountain beneath that statue of some
long-dead queen, two spans or more tall and pointing to the sea, he
would have passed by without a second look.</p>

<p>The common room of The Wandering Woman was dim and
comparatively cool after the bright heat outside. He took off his
hat gratefully. A faint haze of pipesmoke hung in the air, but the
arabesque-carved shutters across the wide arched windows let in
more than enough light. Some bedraggled pine branches had been tied
above the windows for Swovan Night. In one corner, two women with
flutes and a fellow with a small drum between his knees provided a
shrill, pulsing sort of music that Mat had come to like. Even at
this time of the day there were a few patrons, outland merchants in
moderately plain woolens with a sprinkling of Ebou Dari, most in
the vests of various guilds. No apprentices or even journeymen
here; so close to the palace, The Wandering Woman was hardly an
inexpensive place to drink or eat, much less sleep.</p>

<p>The rattle of dice at a table in the corner echoed
the feel in his head, but he turned the other way, to where three
of his men sat on benches around another table. Corevin, a thickly
muscled Cairhienin with a nose that made his eyes seem even smaller
than they were, sat stripped to the waist, holding his tattooed
arms over his head while Vanin wound strips of bandage around his
middle. Vanin was three times Corevin&rsquo;s size, but he looked
like a balding sack of suet overflowing his bench. His coat
appeared to have been slept in for a week; it always did, even an
hour after one of the serving women ironed it. Some of the
merchants eyed the three uneasily, but none of the Ebou Dari; men
or women, they had seen the same or worse, often.</p>

<p>Harnan, a lantern-jawed Tairen file leader with a
crude tattoo of a hawk on his left cheek, was berating Corevin. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;don&rsquo;t care what the flaming fish-seller said, you
goat-spawned toad, you use your bloody club and don&rsquo;t go
accepting flaming challenges just because&mdash;&rdquo; He cut off when
he saw Mat, and tried to look as if he had not been saying what he
had. He just looked as if he had a toothache.</p>

<p>If Mat asked, it would turn out Corevin had slipped
and fallen on his own dagger or some such foolery Mat was supposed
to pretend to believe. So he just leaned his fists on the table as
if he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Truth to tell, it was not
that out of the ordinary. Vanin was the only man who had not been
in two dozen scrapes already; for some reason, men looking for
trouble walked as wide of Vanin as they did Nalesean. The only
difference was that Vanin seemed to like it that way. &ldquo;Has Thom or
Juilin been here yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vanin did not look up from tying the bandages. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t seen hide, hair nor toenail. Nalesean was in for a
bit, though.&rdquo; There was no &ldquo;my lord&rdquo; nonsense from Vanin. He made
no bones about not liking nobles. With the unfortunate exception of
Elayne. &ldquo;Left an iron-strapped chest up in your room, and went out
babbling about trinkets.&rdquo; He made as if to spit through the gap in
his teeth, then glanced at one of the serving women and did not.
Mistress Anan was death on anybody spitting on her floors, or
tossing bones, or even tapping out a pipe. &ldquo;The boy&rsquo;s out back
in the stable,&rdquo; he went on before Mat could ask, &ldquo;with his book and
one of the innkeeper&rsquo;s daughters. Another of the girls spanked
his bottom for pinching hers.&rdquo; Finishing the last knot, he gave Mat
an accusatory look, as if it had been his fault in some way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor little mite,&rdquo; Corevin muttered, twisting to see
whether the bandages would stay in place. He had a leopard and a
boar inked on one arm, a lion and a woman on the other. The woman
did not seem to be wearing much except her hair. &ldquo;Sniveling, he
was. Though he did brighten when Leral let him hold her hand.&rdquo; The
men all looked after Olver like a gaggle of uncles, though
certainly the sort no mother would want near her son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll live,&rdquo; Mat said dryly. The boy was
probably picking up these habits from his &ldquo;uncles.&rdquo; Next, they
would give him a tattoo. At least Olver had not sneaked out to run
with the street children; he seemed to enjoy that almost as much as
he did making himself a nuisance to grown women. &ldquo;Harnan, you wait
here, and if you see Thom or Juilin, collar them. Vanin, I want you
to see what you can learn around the Chelsaine Palace, over near
the Three Towers Gate.&rdquo; Hesitating, he looked over the room.
Serving women drifted in and out of the kitchens with food and,
more often, drink. Most of the patrons seemed intent on their
silver cups, though a pair of women in weaver&rsquo;s vests argued
quietly, ignoring their wine punch and leaning across the table at
one another. Some of the merchants appeared to be haggling, waving
hands and dipping fingers in their drinks to scribble numbers on
the table. The music should mask his words from eavesdroppers, but
he lowered his voice anyway.</p>

<p>News that Jaichim Carridin had Darkfriends coming to
call screwed Vanin&rsquo;s round face into a scowl, as if he might
spit no matter who saw. Harnan muttered something about filthy
Whitecloaks, and Corevin suggested denouncing Carridin to the Civil
Guard. That got such disgusted looks from the other two that he
buried his face in a cup of ale. He was one of the few men Mat knew
who could drink Ebou Dari ale in this heat. Or drink it at all, for
that matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; Mat warned when Vanin stood. It was not
that he was worried, really. Vanin moved with surprising lightness
for such a fat man. He was the best horsethief in two countries at
the least, and could slip by even a Warder unseen, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;They&rsquo;re a nasty lot. Whitecloaks or Darkfriends, either one.&rdquo;
The man only grunted and motioned for Corevin to gather his shirt
and coat and come along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord?&rdquo; Harnan said as they left. &ldquo;My Lord, I
heard there was a fog in the Rahad yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the point of turning away, Mat stopped. Harnan
looked worried, and nothing much worried him. &ldquo;What do you mean, a
fog?&rdquo; In this heat, fog thick as porridge would not last a
heartbeat.</p>

<p>The file leader shrugged uncomfortably and peered
into his mug. &ldquo;A fog. I heard there was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;things&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;in it.&rdquo;
He looked up at Mat. &ldquo;I heard people just disappeared. And some was
found eaten, parts of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat managed not to shiver. &ldquo;The fog&rsquo;s gone,
isn&rsquo;t it? You weren&rsquo;t in it. Worry when you are.
That&rsquo;s all you can do.&rdquo; Harnan frowned doubtfully, but that
was the pure truth. These bubbles of evil&mdash;that was what Rand
called them, what Moiraine had&mdash;burst where and when they
chose, and there did not seem to be anything even Rand could do to
stop them. Worrying about it did as much good as worrying whether a
roof tile would fall on your head in the street tomorrow. Less,
since you could decide to stay indoors.</p>

<p>There was something that was worth worrying over,
though. Nalesean had left their winnings sitting upstairs. Bloody
nobles tossed gold around like water. Leaving Harnan studying his
mug, Mat headed for the railless stairs at the back of the room,
but before he reached them, one of the serving women accosted
him.</p>

<p>Caira was a slender, full-lipped girl with smoky
eyes. &ldquo;A man came in looking for you, my Lord,&rdquo; she said, twisting
her skirts from side to side and looking up at him through long
lashes. There was a certain smokiness in her voice, too. &ldquo;Said he
was an Illuminator, but he looked seedy to me. He ordered a meal,
and left when Mistress Anan wouldn&rsquo;t give it. He wanted you to
pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Next time, pigeon, give the meal,&rdquo; he told her,
slipping a silver mark into the plunging neck of her dress. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
speak to Mistress Anan.&rdquo; He did want to find an Illuminator&mdash;a real one, not some fellow selling fireworks full of sawdust&mdash;but it hardly mattered now. Not with the gold lying
unguarded. And fogs in the Rahad, and Darkfriends, and Aes Sedai,
and bloody Tylin taking leave of her senses, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Caira giggled and twisted like a stroked cat. &ldquo;Would
you like me to bring some punch to your room, my Lord? Or
anything?&rdquo; She smiled hopefully, invitingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe later,&rdquo; he said, tapping her nose with a
fingertip. She giggled again; she always did. Caira would have her
skirt sewn to show petticoats to the middle of her thigh or higher
had Mistress Anan allowed it, but the innkeeper looked after her
serving women almost as closely as she did her daughters. Almost. &ldquo;Maybe later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trotting up the wide stone stairs, he put Caira out
of his mind. What was he to do about Olver? The boy would find
himself in real trouble one day if he thought he could treat women
that way. He was going to have to keep him away from Harnan and the
others as much as possible, he supposed. They were a bad influence
on a boy. To have this on top of everything else! He had to get
Nynaeve and Elayne out of Ebou Dar before something worse went
wrong.</p>

<p>His room was at the front, with windows overlooking
the square, and as he reached for the door, the hallway floor
behind him squeaked. In a hundred inns, it would not even have
registered, but the floors in The Wandering Woman did not
squeak.</p>

<p>He looked back&mdash;and spun just in time to drop
his hat and catch the descending truncheon with his left hand
instead of his skull. The blow stung his hand to numbness, but he
held on desperately as thick fingers dug into his throat, forcing
him back against the door to his room. His head hit with a thump.
Silver-rimmed black spots danced in his vision, obscuring a
sweating face. All he could really see was a big nose and yellow
teeth, and those seemed hazy. Suddenly he realized he was on the
far edge of consciousness; those fingers were closing off blood to
his brain along with air. His free hand went beneath his coat,
fumbling over the hilts of his knives as though his fingers no
longer remembered what they were for. The cudgel wrenched free. He
could see it rising, feel it rising to smash his skull. Focusing
everything, he jerked a knife from its scabbard and thrust.</p>

<p>His attacker let out a high-pitched scream, and Mat
was vaguely aware of the club bouncing off his shoulder as it fell
to the floor, but the man did not let go of his throat. Stumbling,
Mat drove him back, tearing at the clutching fingers with one hand,
driving his knife repeatedly with the other.</p>

<p>Abruptly the fellow fell, sliding from Mat&rsquo;s
blade. The knife nearly followed him to the floor. So did Mat.
Gulping breath, sweet air, he clung to something, a doorway, to
hold himself on his feet. From the floor a plain-faced man stared
up at him with eyes that would never see anything again, a heavyset
fellow with curled Murandian mustaches, in a dark blue coat fit for
a small merchant or a prosperous shopkeeper. Not the look of a
thief about him at all.</p>

<p>Abruptly he realized they had stumbled through an
open door in their fight. It was a smaller room than Mat&rsquo;s,
windowless, a pair of oil lamps on small tables beside the narrow
bed providing a murky illumination. A lanky, pale-haired man
straightened from a large open chest, staring oddly at the corpse.
The chest took up most of the free space in the room.</p>

<p>Mat opened his mouth to apologize for intruding so
roughly, and the lanky man snatched a long dagger from his belt, a
cudgel from the bed, and leaped over the chest at him. That had not
been the look you gave a dead stranger. Clinging unsteadily to the
doorframe, Mat threw underhanded, the hilt no sooner leaving his
hand than he was scrabbling under his coat for another. His knife
stuck squarely in the other man&rsquo;s throat, and Mat almost fell
again, this time from relief, as the man clutched himself, blood
spurting between his fingers, and toppled backward into the open
chest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to be lucky,&rdquo; Mat croaked.</p>

<p>Staggering, he retrieved his knife, wiping it clean
on the fellow&rsquo;s gray coat. A better coat than the other; still
wool, but of a better cut. A lesser lord would not have been
ashamed to wear it. Andoran, by the collar. He sank onto the bed,
frowning at the man sprawled in the chest. A noise made him look
up.</p>

<p>His manservant was in the doorway, trying
unsuccessfully to hide a large black iron frying pan behind his
back. Nerim kept a full set of pots, and everything else he thought
a lord&rsquo;s servant might need traveling, in the small room he
shared with Olver next to Mat&rsquo;s. He was short even for a
Cairhienin, and skinny to boot. &ldquo;My Lord has blood on his coat
again, I fear,&rdquo; he murmured in melancholy tones. The day he sounded
anything else, the sun would rise in the west. &ldquo;I do wish my Lord
would be more careful of his clothes. It is so hard to remove blood
without a stain, and the insects hardly need any encouragement to
eat holes. This place has more insects than I have ever seen, my
Lord.&rdquo; No mention at all of two dead men, or what he had intended
with the frying pan.</p>

<p>That scream had drawn other attention; The Wandering
Woman was not the sort of inn where screams passed unremarked. Feet
pounded in the hallway, and Mistress Anan pushed Nerim firmly out
of her way and raised her skirts to step around the corpse on the
floor. Her husband followed her in, a square-faced, gray-haired man
with the double earring of the Ancient and Honorable League of the
Nets dangling from his left ear. The two white stones on the lower
hoop said he owned other boats beside the one he captained. Jasfer
Anan was part of the reason Mat was careful not to smile too much
at any of Mistress Anan&rsquo;s daughters. The man wore a work knife
stuffed behind his belt and a longer, curved blade too, and his
long blue-and-green vest revealed arms and chest crisscrossed with
dueling scars. He was alive, though, and most of the men who had
given those scars were not.</p>

<p>The other reason for caution was Setalle Anan
herself. Mat had never before let himself be turned off a girl
because of her mother, even if that mother owned the inn where he
was staying, but Mistress Anan had a way about her. Large gold
hoops in her ears swung as she surveyed the dead men without a
flinch. She was pretty despite a touch of gray in her hair, and her
marriage knife nestled in roundness that normally would have drawn
his eyes like moths to a candle, yet looking at her that way would
have been like looking at&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Not his mother. At an Aes Sedai,
maybe&mdash;though he had done that, of course, just to look&mdash;or at Queen Tylin, the Light help him there. Putting a
finger on why was not easy. She simply had a way about her. It was
just difficult to think of doing anything that would offend Setalle
Anan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of them jumped me in the hall.&rdquo; Mat kicked the
chest lightly; it made a hollow sound despite the dead man slumped
inside with his arms and legs dangling out. &ldquo;This is empty except
for him. I think they meant to fill it with whatever they could
steal.&rdquo; The gold, perhaps? Not likely they could have heard of
that, won only hours ago, but he would ask Mistress Anan about a
safer place to keep it.</p>

<p>She nodded calmly, hazel eyes serene. Men knifed in
her inn did not ruffle her feathers. &ldquo;They insisted on carrying it
up themselves. Their stock, so they claimed. They took the room
just before you came in. For a few hours, they said, to sleep
before traveling on toward Nor Chasen.&rdquo; That was a small village on
the coast to the east, but it was unlikely they would have told the
truth. Her tone implied as much. She frowned at the dead men as
though wishing she could shake them alive to answer questions. &ldquo;They were picky about the room, though. The pale-haired man was in
charge. He turned down the first three he was offered, then
accepted this, that was meant for a single servant. I thought he
was being stingy with a coin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even a thief can be tightfisted,&rdquo; Mat said absently.
This could have qualified to start those dice rolling in his head&mdash;a head that would have been cracked open for sure without
the luck of that fellow stepping on the one board in the whole inn
that would squeak&mdash;but the bloody things were still tumbling.
He did not like it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think it was chance then, my Lord?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had no answer, but she frowned at the corpses
again. Maybe she was not so sanguine as he had thought. She was not
native to Ebou Dar, after all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too many roughs in the city of late.&rdquo; Jasfer had a
deep voice, and speaking normally he seemed to be barking commands
on a fishing boat. &ldquo;Maybe you ought to think on hiring guards.&rdquo; All
Mistress Anan did was lift an eyebrow at her husband, but his hands
rose defensively. &ldquo;Peace be on you, wife. I spoke without
thinking.&rdquo; Ebou Dari women were known to express displeasure with a
husband in a sharp fashion. It was not beyond possibility that a
few of his scars came from her. The marriage knife had several
uses.</p>

<p>Thanking the Light he was not married to an Ebou
Dari, Mat replaced his own knife in its sheath alongside the
others. Thank the Light he was not married at all. His fingers
brushed paper.</p>

<p>Mistress Anan was not letting her husband off easily. &ldquo;You frequently do, husband,&rdquo; she said, fingering the hilt between
her breasts. &ldquo;Many women would not let it pass. Elynde always tells
me I am not firm enough when you speak out of line. I need to
provide a good example for my daughters.&rdquo; Acerbity melted into a
smile, if a small one. &ldquo;Consider yourself chastised. I will refrain
from telling you who should haul which net on which boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are too kind to me, wife,&rdquo; he replied dryly.
There was no guild for innkeepers in Ebou Dar, but every inn in the
city was in the hands of a woman; to Ebou Dari, bad luck of the
worst sort would dog any inn owned by a man or any vessel owned by
a woman. There were no women in the fishermen&rsquo;s guild.</p>

<p>Mat pulled out the paper. It was snowy white,
expensive and stiff, and folded small. The few lines on it were
printed in square letters like those Olver might use. Or an adult
who did not want the hand recognized.</p>

<p class="note">ELAYNE AND NYNAEVE ARE PUSHING TOO FAR. REMIND
THEM THEY ARE STILL IN DANGER FROM THE TOWER. WARN THEM TO BE
CAREFUL, OR THEY WILL BE KNEELING TO ASK ELAIDA&rsquo;S PARDON
YET.</p>

<p>That was all; no signature. <em>Still</em> in danger?
That suggested it was nothing new, and somehow it did not fit with
them being snared up by the rebels. No, that was the wrong
question. Who had slipped him this note? Obviously somebody who
thought they could not simply hand it to him. Who had had the
opportunity since he put the coat on this morning? It had not been
there then, for sure. Somebody who had gotten close. Somebody&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Unbidden, he found himself humming a snatch of &ldquo;She Dazzles My Eyes
and Clouds My Mind.&rdquo; Around here the tune had different words; they
called it &ldquo;Upside Down and &rsquo;Round and &rsquo;Round.&rdquo; Only
Teslyn or Joline fit, and that was impossible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bad news, my Lord?&rdquo; Mistress Anan asked.</p>

<p>Mat stuffed the note into his pocket. &ldquo;Does any man
ever get to understand women? I don&rsquo;t mean just Aes Sedai. Any
women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jasfer roared, and when his wife directed a meaning
gaze his way, he only laughed harder. The look she gave Mat would
have shamed an Aes Sedai for its perfect serenity. &ldquo;Men have it
quite easy, my Lord, if they only looked or listened. Women have
the difficult task. We must try to understand men.&rdquo; Jasfer took
hold of the doorframe, tears rolling down his dark face. She eyed
him sideways, tilting her head, then turned, all cool calmness&mdash;and punched him under the ribs with her fist so hard that
his knees buckled. His laughter took on a wheeze without stopping. &ldquo;There is a saying in Ebou Dar, my Lord,&rdquo; she said to Mat over her
shoulder. &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;A man is a maze of brambles in darkness, and even
he does not know the way.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat snorted. Fat lot of help she was. Well, Teslyn or
Joline or somebody else&mdash;it must have been somebody else, if
he could only think who&mdash;the White Tower was a long way away.
Jaichim Carridin was right here. He frowned at the two corpses. And
so were a hundred other scoundrels. Somehow he would see those two
women safely out of Ebou Dar. The trouble was, he did not have a
clue how. He wished those bloody dice would stop, and be done with
it.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The apartments Joline shared with Teslyn were quite
spacious, including a bedchamber for each of them, plus one apiece
for their maids and another that would have done quite well for
Blaeric and Fen, if Teslyn could have stood to have her Warders
with them. The woman saw every man as a potentially rabid wolf, and
there was no gainsaying her when she truly wanted something. As
inexorable as Elaida, she ground down whatever lay in her path.
They stood as equals in every real way, certainly, but not many
managed to prevail over Teslyn without a clear advantage. She was
at the writing table in the sitting room when Joline entered, her
pen making an awful <em>scritch-scritch</em>. She was always
parsimonious with the ink.</p>

<p>Without a word, Joline swept by her and out onto the
balcony, a long cage of white-painted iron. The scrollwork was so
tight that the men working in the garden three stories below would
have a difficult time seeing that there was anyone within. Flowers
in this region ordinarily thrived in heat, wild colors to outshine
the interior of the palace, but nothing bloomed down there.
Gardeners moved along the gravel walks with buckets of water, yet
nearly every leaf was yellow or brown. She would not have admitted
it under torture, but the heat made her afraid. The Dark One was
touching the world, and their only hope a boy who was running
wild.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bread and water?&rdquo; Teslyn said suddenly. &ldquo;Send the
Cauthon boy off to the Tower? If there do be changes in what we did
plan, you will please inform me before telling others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joline felt a touch of heat in her cheeks. &ldquo;Merilille
needed to be set down. She lectured when I was a novice.&rdquo; So had
Teslyn; a severe teacher who held her classes with an iron grip.
Just the way she spoke was a reminder, a marked warning not to go
against her, equal or not. Merilille, though, stood lower. &ldquo;She
used to make us stand in front of the class, and she would dig and
dig for the answer she wanted, until we stood there in front of
every one, weeping with frustration. She pretended to sympathize,
or perhaps she really did, but the more she patted us and told us
not to cry, the worse it was.&rdquo; She cut off abruptly. She had not
intended to say all that. It was Teslyn&rsquo;s fault, always
looking at her as if she were about to be upbraided for a spot on
her dress. But she should understand; Merilille had taught her,
too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have remembered that all this time?&rdquo; Stark
incredulity painted Teslyn&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;The sisters who did teach
us did only do their duty. Sometimes I do think what Elaida did say
of you do be right.&rdquo; The annoying <em>scritch-scritch</em> resumed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;simply came to mind when Merilille began as
if she were truly an ambassador.&rdquo; Instead of a rebel. Joline
frowned at the garden. She despised every one of those women who
had broken the White Tower, and flaunted the break before all the
world. Them and anyone who aided them. But Elaida had blundered
too, horribly. The sisters who were rebels now could have been
reconciled, with a little effort. &ldquo;What did she say of me? Teslyn?&rdquo;
The sound of the pen continued, like fingernails scraping across a
slate. Joline went back inside. &ldquo;What did Elaida say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Teslyn laid another sheet atop her letter, either to
blot or to shield it from Joline&rsquo;s eyes, but she did not
answer immediately. She scowled at Joline&mdash;or perhaps just
looked; it was difficult to say with her at times&mdash;and at
last sighed. &ldquo;Very well. If you must know. She did say you still do
be a child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A <em>child</em>?&rdquo; Joline&rsquo;s shock had no effect
on the other woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some,&rdquo; Teslyn said calmly, &ldquo;do change little from
the day they do put on novice white. Some do change no at all.
Elaida does believe you have no grown up yet and never will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joline tossed her head angrily, unwilling to let
herself speak. To have that said by someone whose <em>mother</em>
had been a child when she herself gained the shawl! Elaida had been
petted too much as a novice, made over too much for her strength
and the remarkable speed of her learning. Joline suspected that was
why she was in such a fury about Elayne and Egwene and the wilder
Nynaeve; because they were stronger than she, because they had
spent far less time as novices, no matter that they had been pushed
ahead too fast. Why, Nynaeve had never been a novice at all, and
that was completely unheard of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since you did bring it up,&rdquo; Teslyn went on, &ldquo;perhaps
we should try to take advantage of the situation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Embracing the True Source, Joline
channeled Air to lift the silver pitcher on the turquoise-inlaid
side table and fill a silver goblet with punch. As always, the joy
of embracing <em>saidar</em> thrilled her, soothing even as it
exhilarated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It do be obvious, I should think. Elaida&rsquo;s
orders do still stand. Elayne and Nynaeve are to be returned to the
Tower as soon as found. I did agree to wait, but perhaps we should
wait no longer. A pity the al&rsquo;Vere girl does no be with them.
But two will put us back in Elaida&rsquo;s good graces, and if we
can add the Cauthon boy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I do think those three will make her
welcome us as if we did come with al&rsquo;Thor himself. And this
Aviendha will make a fine novice, wilder or no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The goblet floated into Joline&rsquo;s hand on Air,
and she reluctantly released the Power. She had never lost the
ardor she felt the first time she touched the Source. Dewmelon
punch was a poor substitute for <em>saidar</em>. The worst part of
her penance before leaving the Tower had been losing the right to
touch <em>saidar</em>. Almost the worst part. She had set it all
herself, but Elaida had made it clear that if she did not make it
harsh, Elaida would. She had no doubt the result would have been
much worse, then. &ldquo;Her good graces? Teslyn, she humiliated us for
no more reason than to show the others that she could. She sent us
to this fly-ridden hole as far from everything important as she
could, short of the other side of the Aryth Ocean, ambassadors to a
queen with less power than a dozen of her own nobles, any one of
whom could snatch the throne from her tomorrow if they could be
bothered to. And you want to wheedle your way back into
Elaida&rsquo;s favor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She do be the Amyrlin Seat.&rdquo; Teslyn touched the
letter with the page lying atop it, moving the sheets a bit this
way then a bit that, as if framing her thoughts. &ldquo;Remaining silent
for a time did let her know we are no lapdogs, but remaining silent
too long could be seen as treason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joline sniffed. &ldquo;Ridiculous! When they&rsquo;re
returned they&rsquo;ll only be punished for running away, and now
for pretending to be full sisters.&rdquo; Her mouth tightened. They were
both guilty there, and those who allowed them to, as well, but it
made a sharp difference when one of them claimed her own Ajah. By
the time the Green Ajah finished with Elayne for that, it would be
a very chastened young woman indeed who took the throne of Andor.
Though it might be best if Elayne secured the Lion Throne first.
Her training had to be completed, either way. Joline did not intend
to see Elayne lost to the Tower, whatever she had done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do no forget joining with the rebels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light, Teslyn, they were probably scooped up just
like the girls the rebels took out of the Tower. Does it really
matter a whit whether they begin mucking out stalls tomorrow or
next year?&rdquo; That was surely as much as the novices and Accepted
with the rebels would have to face. &ldquo;Even the Ajahs can wait to
have them in hand, really. It is not as if they aren&rsquo;t safe.
They are Accepted, after all, and they certainly seem content to
stay where we can reach them whenever we choose. I say, let us sit
where Elaida put us, and continue to fold our hands and hold our
tongues. Until she asks nicely to find out what we are doing.&rdquo; She
did not say that she was prepared to wait until Elaida found
herself deposed as Siuan had been. The Hall surely would not put up
with the bullying and bungling forever, but Teslyn was Red, after
all, and would not appreciate hearing that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose there do be no urgency,&rdquo; Teslyn said
slowly, the unspoken &ldquo;but&rdquo; all but shouting itself.</p>

<p>Drawing a ball-footed chair to the table with another
flow of Air, Joline settled herself to convincing her companion
that silence remained the best policy. Still a child, was she? If
she had her way, Elaida would not get so much as a word out of Ebou
Dar until she begged for it.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The woman on the table arched up as far as her bonds
would allow, eyes bulging, throat corded with a piercing scream
that went on and on. Abruptly the scream was a loud choking rasp
instead, and she convulsed, shaking from wrists to ankles, then
collapsed in silence. Wide-open eyes stared sightlessly at the
cobwebbed basement ceiling.</p>

<p>Giving vent to curses was irrational, but Falion
could have turned the air as blue as any stableman. Not for the
first time she wished she had Temaile here instead of Ispan.
Questions were answered eagerly for Temaile, and nobody died until
she was ready. Of course, Temaile enjoyed the work entirely too
much, but that was beside the point.</p>

<p>Channeling once more, Falion gathered the
woman&rsquo;s clothes from the filthy floor and dropped them atop
the body. The red leather belt fell off, and she snatched it up by
hand and slapped it back onto the pile. Perhaps she should have
used other methods, but straps and pincers and hot irons were so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;messy. &ldquo;Leave the body in an alley somewhere. Slit the throat
so it looks as if she was robbed. You can keep the coins in her
purse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two men squatting on their heels against the
stone wall exchanged looks. Arnin and Nad might have been brothers
by their appearance, all black hair and beady eyes and scars, with
more muscles than any three men could need, but they did have
sufficient brains to carry out simple orders. Usually. &ldquo;Forgiveness, Mistress,&rdquo; Arnin said hesitantly, &ldquo;but no one will
believe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do as you are told!&rdquo; she snapped, channeling to haul
him to his feet and slam him back against the stones. His head
bounced, yet that surely could do him no damage.</p>

<p>Nad rushed to the table, babbling, &ldquo;Yes, Mistress. As
you command, Mistress.&rdquo; When she released Arnin, he did not babble,
but he staggered over without any more objections to help gather up
the body like so much rubbish and carry it out. Well, it was so
much rubbish, now. She regretted the outburst. Letting temper take
control was irrational. It did seem to be effective at times,
though. After all these years, that still surprised her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moghedien, she will not like this,&rdquo; Ispan said as
soon as the men had gone. The blue and green beads that were worked
into her many slim black braids clacked as she shook her head. She
had remained in the shadows the whole time, in a corner, with a
small ward woven so she could not hear.</p>

<p>Falion managed not to glare. Ispan was the last
companion she would have chosen for herself. She was Blue, or had
been. Perhaps she still was. Falion did not really think herself
any less White Ajah because she had joined the Black. Blues were
too fervent, tying emotion around what should be viewed with utter
dispassion. Rianna, another White, would have been her choice.
Though the woman did have odd, unsound notions on several points of
logic. &ldquo;Moghedien has forgotten us, Ispan. Or have you received
some private word from her? In any case, I am convinced this cache
does not exist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moghedien, she says that it does.&rdquo; Ispan began
firmly, but her voice quickly grew warm. &ldquo;A store of
<em>angreal</em>, and <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>, and
<em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. We will have some part of them.
<em>Angreal</em> of our very own, Falion. Perhaps even
<em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>. She has promised.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moghedien was wrong.&rdquo; Falion watched shock widen the
other woman&rsquo;s eyes. The Chosen were only people.</p>

<p>Learning that lesson had stunned Falion too, but some
refused to learn. The Chosen were vastly stronger, infinitely more
knowledgeable, and quite possibly they had already received the
reward of immortality, but by all evidence they schemed and fought
each other as hard as two Murandians with one blanket.</p>

<p>Ispan&rsquo;s shock quickly gave way to anger. &ldquo;There
are others looking. Would they all look for nothing? There are
Friends of the Dark looking; they must have been sent by others of
the Chosen. If the Chosen look, can you still say there is
nothing?&rdquo; She would not see. If a thing could not be found, the
most obvious reason was that it was not there.</p>

<p>Falion waited. Ispan was not stupid, only awestruck,
and Falion did believe in making people teach themselves what they
should already be aware of. Lazy minds needed to be exercised.</p>

<p>Ispan paced, swishing her skirts and frowning at the
dust and old cobwebs. &ldquo;This place smells. And it is filthy!&rdquo; She
shuddered as a large black cockroach went skittering up the wall.
The glow surrounded her for a moment; a flow squashed the beetle
with a popping sound. Making a face, Ispan wiped her hands on her
skirts as if she had used them instead of the Power. She had a
delicate stomach, though fortunately not when she could remove
herself from the actual deed. &ldquo;I will not report the failure to one
of the Chosen, Falion. She would make us envy Liandrin, yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Falion did not quite shiver. She did, however, cross
the basement and pour herself a cup of plum punch. The plums had
been old, and the punch was too sweet, but her hands remained
steady. Fear of Moghedien was perfectly sensible, but yielding to
fear was not. Perhaps the woman was dead. Surely she would have
summoned them by now else, or snatched them sleeping into
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> again to tell her why they had
not yet carried out her commands. Until she saw a body, though, the
only logical choice was to continue as if Moghedien would appear
any moment. &ldquo;There is a way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How? Put every Wise Woman in Ebou Dar to the
question? How many are there? A hundred? Two hundred perhaps? The
sisters in the Tarasin Palace, they would notice this, I
think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forget your dreams of owning a
<em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>, Ispan. There is no long-hidden
storehouse, no secret basement beneath a palace.&rdquo; Falion spoke in
cool, measured tones, perhaps more measured the more agitated Ispan
became. She had always enjoyed mesmerizing a class of novices with
the sound of her voice. &ldquo;Almost all of the Wise Women are wilders,
highly unlikely to know what we wish to learn. No wilder has ever
been found keeping an <em>angreal</em>, much less a
<em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>, and they surely would have been found. On
the contrary, by every record, a wilder who discovers any object
tied to the Power rids herself of it as soon as possible, for fear
of attracting the wrath of the White Tower. Women who are put out
of the Tower, on the other hand, seem not to have the same fear. As
you well know, when they are searched before leaving, fully one in
three has secreted something about her person, an actual object of
the Power or something she believes is one. Of the few Wise Women
who qualify at present, Callie was the perfect choice. When she was
put out four years ago, she tried to steal a small
<em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. A useless thing that makes images of
flowers and the sound of a waterfall, but still an object tied to
<em>saidar</em>. And she tried to discover all the other
novices&rsquo; secrets, succeeding more often than not. If there was
even a single <em>angreal</em> in Ebou Dar, not to speak of a vast
storehouse, do you think she could have been four years here
without locating it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>do</em> wear the shawl, Falion,&rdquo; Ispan said
with extraordinary asperity. &ldquo;And I <em>do</em> know all of that as
well as you. You said there was another way. What way?&rdquo; She simply
would not apply her brain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would please Moghedien as greatly as the
cache?&rdquo; Ispan simply stared at her, tapping her foot. &ldquo;Nynaeve
al&rsquo;Meara, Ispan. Moghedien abandoned us to go chasing after
her, but obviously she escaped somehow. If we give Nynaeve&mdash;and the Trakand girl, for that matter&mdash;to Moghedien, she
would forgive us a hundred <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>.&rdquo; Which clearly
demonstrated that the Chosen could be irrational, of course. It was
best, of course, to be extremely careful with those who were both
irrational and more powerful than you. Ispan was not more
powerful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We should have killed her as I wanted, when she
first appeared,&rdquo; she spat. Waving her hands, she stalked up and
down, grime crunching loudly beneath her slippers. &ldquo;Yes, yes, I
know. Our sisters in the palace, they might have become suspicious.
We do not wish to draw their eyes. But have you forgotten Tanchico?
And Tear? Where those two girls appear, disaster follows. Me, I
think if we cannot kill them, we should remain as far from Nynaeve
al&rsquo;Meara and Elayne Trakand as we can. As far as we can!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Calm yourself, Ispan. Calm yourself.&rdquo; If anything,
Falion&rsquo;s soothing tone only seemed to agitate the other woman
more, but Falion was confident. Logic must prevail over
emotion.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Sitting on an upended barrel in the sparse coolness
of a narrow, shaded alley, he studied the house across the busy
street. Suddenly he realized he was touching his head again. He did
not have a headache, but his head felt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;peculiar&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;sometimes. Most often when he thought of what he could not
remember.</p>

<p>Three stories of white plaster, the house belonged to
a goldsmith who supposedly was being visited by two friends she had
met on a journey north some years ago. The friends had only been
glimpsed on arrival and not seen since. Finding that out had been
easy, finding out they were Aes Sedai only a trifle more
difficult.</p>

<p>A lean young man in a torn vest, whistling his way
down the street with no good on his mind, paused when he glimpsed
him sitting on the barrel. His coat and his location in the shadows&mdash;and the rest of him, he admitted ruefully&mdash;probably
looked tempting. He reached under his coat. His hands no longer
possessed the strength or flexibility for swordwork, but the two
long knives he had carried for well over thirty years had surprised
more than one swordsman. Maybe something showed in his eyes,
because the lean young man thought better of it and whistled his
way on.</p>

<p>Beside the house, the gate that led back to the
goldsmith&rsquo;s stable swung open, and two burly men appeared
pushing a barrow piled high with soiled straw and muck. What were
they up to? Arnin and Nad were hardly the lads to be mucking out
stables.</p>

<p>He would stay here until dark, he decided, then see
whether he could find Carridin&rsquo;s pretty little killer
again.</p>

<p>Once again he pulled his hand down from his head.
Sooner or later, he would remember. He did not have much time left,
but it was all he did have. He remembered that much.</p>
