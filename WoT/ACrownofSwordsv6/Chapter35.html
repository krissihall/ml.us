<h4><em>Into the Woods</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">S</span>itting
cross-legged on Rand&rsquo;s bed, Min watched
him, in his shirtsleeves, rooting through the coats in the huge
ivory-inlaid wardrobe. How could he sleep in this room, with all
its black, heavy furniture? A part of her thought absently about
moving everything out, replacing it with some carved pieces she had
seen in Caemlyn, lightly touched with gilding, and pale draperies
and linens that he would find less oppressive. Odd; she had never
cared one way or another about furniture, or linens. But that one
tapestry of a battle, of a lone swordsman surrounded by enemies and
about to be overwhelmed&mdash;that definitely had to go. Mostly,
though, she just watched him.</p>

<p>There was such an intent look in his morning-blue
eyes, and the snowy shirt tightened across the broad of his back
when he turned to reach deep into the wardrobe&rsquo;s interior. He
had very good legs, and marvelous calves, shown off well in dark
close-fitting breeches, with his boots turned down. Sometimes he
frowned, combing fingers through dark reddish hair; no amount of
brushing could make it ruly; it always curled slightly around his
ears and on the nape of his neck. She was not one of those fool
women who tossed their brains at a man&rsquo;s feet along with their
hearts. It was just that sometimes, near him, thinking clearly
became a trifle difficult. That was all.</p>

<p>Coat after embroidered silk coat came out and was
tossed to the floor atop the one he had worn to the Sea Folk ship.
Could the negotiations still be going half so well without his <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> presence? If only she had a really useful
viewing of the Sea Folk. As always to her eyes, images and colorful
auras flickered around him, most gone too quickly to make out, all
but one meaningless to her at the moment. That one viewing came and
went a hundred times a day, and whenever Mat or Perrin were
present, it encompassed them, too, and sometimes others. A vast
shadow lurked over him, swallowing up thousands upon thousands of
tiny lights like fireflies that hurled themselves into it in an
attempt to fill up the darkness. Today, there seemed to be
countless tens of thousands of fireflies, but the shadow seemed
larger, too. Somehow that viewing represented his battle with the
Shadow, but he almost never wanted to know how it stood. Not that
she could really say, except that the shadow always seemed to be
winning, to one degree or another. She sighed with relief to see
the image go.</p>

<p>A tiny stab of guilt made her shift her seat on the
coverlet. She had not really lied when he asked what viewings she
had kept back. Not really. What good to tell him he would almost
certainly fail without a woman who was dead and gone? He became
bleak too easily as it was. She had to keep his spirits up, make
him remember to laugh. Except&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think this is a good idea, Rand.&rdquo;
Saying that might be a mistake. Men were strange creatures in so
many ways; one minute they took reasonable advice, and the next did
just the opposite. Deliberately did the opposite, it seemed. For
some reason, though, she felt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;protective&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;toward this
towering man who could probably lift her with either hand. And that
without his channeling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a wonderful idea,&rdquo; he said, tossing down a
blue coat with silver embroidery. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>,
and today it seems to be working in my favor for a change.&rdquo; A green
coat with gold embroidery went to the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you rather comfort me again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped dead, staring at her with a silver-worked
red coat hanging forgotten in his hands. She hoped she was not
blushing. Comforting. <em>Where did that idea ever come from?</em>
she wondered silently. The aunts who had raised her were gentle,
kind women, but they had strong notions of proper behavior. They
had disapproved of her wearing breeches, disapproved of her working
in stables, the job she loved best, since it brought her into
contact with horses. There was no question what they would think of
<em>comforting</em>, with a man she was not married to. If they
ever found out, they would ride all the way from Baerlon just to
skin her. And him, too, of course.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;need to keep moving while I&rsquo;m sure it
is still working,&rdquo; he said slowly, then turned quite quickly back
to the wardrobe. &ldquo;This will do,&rdquo; he exclaimed, pulling out a plain
coat of green wool. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know this was in there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the coat he had worn coming back from
Dumai&rsquo;s Wells, and she could see his hands tremble as he
remembered. Trying to be casual, she got up and went to put her
arms around him, crushing the coat between them as she laid her
head against his chest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love you&rdquo; was all she said. Through his shirt she
could feel the round, half-healed scar on his left side. She could
recall when he got it as if it were yesterday. That had been the
first time she ever held him in her arms, while he lay unconscious
and near death.</p>

<p>His hands pressed against her back, squeezing her
tight, squeezing the breath out of her, but then, disappointingly,
they fell away. She thought he muttered something about &ldquo;not fair&rdquo;
under his breath. Was he thinking about the Sea Folk while she
hugged him? He should be, really. Merana was a Gray, yet it was
said the Sea Folk could make a Domani sweat. He should be, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She thought about kicking his ankle. Gently he moved her away and
began pulling on the coat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand,&rdquo; she said firmly, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t be sure it
will have any effect, just because it did on Harine. If you being
<em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> always affected everything, you&rsquo;d have
every ruler kneeling at your feet by now, and the Whitecloaks,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the Dragon Reborn,&rdquo; he replied haughtily, &ldquo;and today I can do anything.&rdquo; Scooping up his sword belt, he
fastened it around his waist. It bore a plain brass buckle, now.
The gilded Dragon lay atop the coverlet on the bed. Gloves of thin
black leather went on to cover the golden-maned heads on the backs
of his hands and the herons branded on his palms. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t
look like him, do I?&rdquo; He spread his arms, smiling. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t
know until it&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She almost threw up her hands. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look
much like a fool, either.&rdquo; And let him take that how he would. The
idiot eyed her askance, as if he was not sure. &ldquo;Rand, as soon as
they see the Aiel, they will either run or start fighting. If you
won&rsquo;t take any of the Aes Sedai, at least take those
Asha&rsquo;man. One arrow, and you&rsquo;re dead, whether you&rsquo;re
the Dragon Reborn or a goatherd!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I <em>am</em> the Dragon Reborn, Min,&rdquo; he said
seriously. &ldquo;And <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>. We are going alone; just
you and me. That is, if you still want to come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going anywhere without me, Rand
al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo; She stopped herself from saying he would trip over
his own feet if he did. This euphoria was almost as bad as the dark
bleakness. &ldquo;Nandera won&rsquo;t like this.&rdquo; She did not know exactly
what went on between him and the Maidens&mdash;something very
peculiar indeed, by the things she had seen&mdash;but any hope
that that might stop him guttered out when he grinned like a small
boy evading his mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t know, Min.&rdquo; He even had a twinkle in
his eye! &ldquo;I do this all the time, and they never know.&rdquo; He held out
a gloved hand, expecting her to jump when he called.</p>

<p>There really was nothing to do but straighten her
green coat, glance into the stand-mirror to make sure of her hair&mdash;and take his hand. The trouble was, she <em>was</em> ready to leap if
he crooked a finger; she just wanted to make sure he never found
out.</p>

<p>In the anteroom, he made a gateway atop the golden
Rising Sun set in the floor, and she let him lead her through onto
a hilly forest floor carpeted with dead leaves. A bird flashed
away, flaring red wings. A squirrel appeared on a branch and
chittered at them, lashing a furry white-tipped tail.</p>

<p>It was hardly the sort of woods she remembered from
near Baerlon; there were not many real forests anywhere close to
the city of Cairhien. Most of the trees stood four or five or even
ten paces apart, tall leatherleafs and pines, taller oaks and trees
she did not know, running across the flat she and Rand stood on and
up a slope that began only a few spans off. Even the undergrowth
seemed thinner than back home, the bushes and vines and briars
spread out in patches, though some of those were not small.
Everything was brown and dry. She plucked a lace-edged handkerchief
from her sleeve and dabbed at the sweat that suddenly seemed to pop
out on her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which way do we go?&rdquo; she asked. By the sun, north
lay over the slope, the direction she would choose. The city should
lie about seven or eight miles in that direction. With luck, they
could walk all the way back without encountering anyone. Or better,
given her heeled boots and the terrain, not to mention the heat,
Rand could decide to give up and make another gateway back to the
Sun Palace. The palace rooms were cool compared to this.</p>

<p>Before he could answer, crackling brush and leaves
announced someone coming. The rider who appeared on a long-legged
gray gelding with bright-fringed bridle and reins was a Cairhienin
woman, short and slender in a dark blue, nearly black, silk riding
dress, horizontal slashes of red and green and white running from
her neck to below her knees. The sweat on her face could not
diminish her pale beauty, or make her eyes less than large dark
pools. A small clear green stone hung on her forehead from a fine
golden chain fastened in black hair that fell in waves to her
shoulders.</p>

<p>Min gasped, and not for the hunting crossbow the
woman carried casually raised in one green-gloved hand. For a
moment, she was sure it was Moiraine. But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not recall seeing either of you in the camp,&rdquo;
the woman said in a throaty, almost sultry, voice. Moiraine&rsquo;s
voice had been crystal. The crossbow lowered, still quite casually,
until it pointed rock-steady at Rand&rsquo;s chest.</p>

<p>He ignored it. &ldquo;I thought I might like to take a look
at your camp,&rdquo; he said with a slight bow. &ldquo;I believe you are the
Lady Caraline Damodred?&rdquo; The slender woman inclined her head,
acknowledging the name.</p>

<p>Min sighed regretfully, but it was not as if she had
really expected Moiraine to turn up alive. Moiraine was the only
viewing of hers that had ever failed. But Caraline Damodred
herself, one of the leaders of the rebellion against Rand here in
Cairhien, and a claimant to the Sun Throne&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He really was
pulling all the threads of the Pattern around him, to have her
appear.</p>

<p>Lady Caraline slowly raised the crossbow to one side;
the cord made a loud snap, launching the broadhead bolt into the
air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt one would do any good against you,&rdquo; she
said, walking her gelding slowly toward them, &ldquo;and I would not like
you to think I was threatening you.&rdquo; She looked once at Min&mdash;just a glance that ran head to toe, though Min was sure everything
about her was filed away&mdash;but aside from that, Lady Caraline
kept her eyes on Rand. She drew rein three paces away, just far
enough so he could not reach her afoot before she could dig in her
heels. &ldquo;I can only think of one gray-eyed man with your height who
might suddenly appear out of nowhere, unless perhaps you are an
Aiel in disguise, but perhaps you will be so kind as to supply a
name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the Dragon Reborn,&rdquo; Rand said, every bit as
arrogant as he had been with the Sea Folk, yet if any <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> swirling of the Pattern was at work, the woman
on the horse gave no evidence.</p>

<p>Rather than leaping down to fall to her knees, she
merely nodded, pursing her lips. &ldquo;I have heard so very much about
you. I have heard you went to the Tower to submit to the Amyrlin
Seat. I have heard you mean to give the Sun Throne to Elayne
Trakand. I have also heard that you killed Elayne, and her
mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I submit to no one,&rdquo; Rand replied sharply. He stared
up at her with eyes fierce enough to snatch her out of the saddle
by themselves. &ldquo;Elayne is on her way to Caemlyn as we speak, to
take the throne of Andor. After which, she will have the throne of
Cairhien as well.&rdquo; Min winced. Did he have to sound like a pillow
stuffed full of haughty? She had hoped he had calmed down a bit
after the Sea Folk.</p>

<p>Lady Caraline laid her crossbow across the saddle in
front of her, running a gloved hand along it. Perhaps regretting
that loosed bolt? &ldquo;I could accept my young cousin on the throne&mdash;better she than some, at least&mdash;but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Those big
dark eyes that had seemed so liquid suddenly became stone. &ldquo;But I
am not sure I can accept you in Cairhien, and I do not mean only
your changes to laws and customs. You&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;change fate by your
very presence. Every day since you came, people die in accidents so
bizarre no one can believe them. So many husbands abandon their
wives, and wives their husbands, that no one even comments upon it
now. You will tear Cairhien apart just by remaining here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Balance,&rdquo; Min broke in hastily. Rand&rsquo;s face was
so dark, he looked ready to burst. Maybe he had been right to come
after all. Certainly there was no point letting him throw this
meeting away in a tantrum. She gave no one a chance to speak. &ldquo;There is always a balance of good against bad. That&rsquo;s how the
Pattern works. Even he doesn&rsquo;t change that. As night balances
day, good balances harm. Since he came, there hasn&rsquo;t been a
single stillbirth in the city, not one child born deformed. There
are more marriages some days than used to be in a week, and for
every man who chokes to death on a feather, a woman tumbles head
over heels down three flights of stairs and, instead of breaking
her neck, stands up without a bruise. Name the evil, and you can
point to the good. The turning of the Wheel requires balance, and
he only increases the chances of what might have happened anyway in
nature.&rdquo; Suddenly she colored, realizing they were both looking at
her. Staring, more like.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Balance?&rdquo; Rand murmured, eyebrows lifting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been reading some of Master Fel&rsquo;s
books,&rdquo; she said faintly. She did not want anyone to think she was
pretending to be a philosopher. Lady Caraline smiled at her tall
saddlebow and toyed with her reins. The woman was <em>laughing</em>
at her. She would show this woman what she could laugh at!</p>

<p>Abruptly a tall black gelding with the look of a
warhorse came crashing through the undergrowth, ridden by a man
well into his middle years, with close-cropped hair and a pointed
beard. Despite his yellow Tairen coat, the fat sleeves striped with
green satin, eyes of a startling pretty blue looked out of his
damp, dark face, like pale polished sapphires. Not a particularly
pretty man, but those eyes made up for a too-long nose. He carried
a crossbow in one leather-gauntleted hand, and brandished a
broadhead bolt in the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This came down inches from my face, Caraline, and it
has your markings! Just because there&rsquo;s no game is no reason&mdash;&rdquo; He became aware of Rand and Min just then, and his drawn
crossbow lowered toward them. &ldquo;Are these strays, Caraline, or did
you find spies from the city? I&rsquo;ve never believed al&rsquo;Thor
would continue to let us sit here unhindered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Half a dozen more riders appeared behind him,
sweating men in fat-sleeved coats with satin stripes and perspiring
women in riding dresses with wide, thick lace collars. All carrying
crossbows. The last of those riders had not halted, horses stamping
and tossing heads, before twice as many came struggling through the
brush from another direction and pulled up near Caraline, slight,
pale men and women in dark clothes with stripes of color sometimes
to below the waist. All with crossbows. Servants afoot came after,
laboring and panting with the heat, the men who would dress and
carry any downed game. It hardly seemed to matter that none had
more than a skinning knife at his belt. Min swallowed, and
unconsciously began patting her cheeks with her handkerchief a
little more vigorously. If even one person recognized Rand before
he knew it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lady Caraline did not hesitate. &ldquo;Not spies, Darlin,&rdquo;
she said, turning her horse to face the Tairen newcomers. The High
Lord Darlin Sisnera! All that was needed now was Lord Toram Riatin.
Min wished Rand&rsquo;s <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> tugging at the
Pattern could be just a little less complete. &ldquo;A cousin and his
wife,&rdquo; Caraline went on, &ldquo;come from Andor to see me. May I present
Tomas Trakand&mdash;from a minor branch of the House&mdash;and
his wife Jaisi.&rdquo; Min almost glared at her; the only Jaisi she had
ever known had been a dusty prune before she was twenty, and sour
and bad-tempered to boot.</p>

<p>Darlin&rsquo;s gaze swept over Rand again, lingered a
moment on Min. He lowered his crossbow and bowed his head just a
hair, a High Lord of Tear to a minor noble. &ldquo;You are welcome, Lord
Tomas. It takes a brave man to join us in our present
circumstances. Al&rsquo;Thor may loose the savages on us any day.&rdquo;
The Lady Caraline gave him an exasperated look that he made a show
of not seeing.</p>

<p>He noted that Rand&rsquo;s return bow was no more than
his, however; noted, and frowned. A darkly handsome woman in his
retinue muttered angrily under her breath&mdash;she had a long
hard face, well-practiced in anger&mdash;and a stout fellow,
scowling and sweating in a red-striped coat of pale green, heeled
his horse forward a few steps as if thinking to ride Rand down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills,&rdquo; Rand said
coolly, as though he noticed nothing. The Dragon Reborn to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The Dragon Reborn to just about anybody, was what it was. Arrogance
on a mountaintop. &ldquo;Not much happens as we expect. For instance, I
heard you were in Tear, in Haddon Mirk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min wished she dared speak up, dared say something to
soothe him. She settled for stroking his arm. Casually. A wife&mdash;now there was a word that suddenly sounded fine&mdash;a
wife idly patting her husband. Another fine word. Light, it was
hard being fair! It was hardly <em>fair</em>, having to be
fair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The High Lord Darlin is but lately come by longboat
with a few of his close friends, Tomas.&rdquo; Caraline&rsquo;s throaty
tone never changed, but her gelding suddenly pranced, no doubt at a
sharp heel, and under cover of regaining control she turned her
back to Darlin and shot Rand a brief warning frown. &ldquo;Do not trouble
the High Lord, Tomas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not mind, Caraline,&rdquo; Darlin said, slinging his
crossbow from his saddle by a loop. He rode a little closer and
rested an arm on his tall saddlebow. &ldquo;A man should know what he is
stepping into. You may have heard the tales about al&rsquo;Thor
going to the Tower, Tomas. I came because Aes Sedai approached me
months ago with suggestions that might happen, and your cousin
informed me she had received the same. We thought we might put her
on the Sun Throne before Colavaere could take it. Well,
al&rsquo;Thor is no fool; never believe he is. Myself, I think he
played the Tower like a harp. Colavaere is hanged, he sits secure
behind Cairhien&rsquo;s walls&mdash;without an Aes Sedai halter,
I&rsquo;ll wager, no matter what rumor says&mdash;and until we find
some way to extricate ourselves, we sit in his hand, waiting for
him to make a fist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A ship brought you,&rdquo; Rand said simply. &ldquo;A ship could
take you away.&rdquo; Abruptly Min realized he was gently patting her
hand on his arm. Trying to soothe her!</p>

<p>Startlingly, Darlin threw back his head and laughed.
A great many women would forget his nose for those eyes and that
laugh. &ldquo;So it would, Tomas, but I&rsquo;ve asked your cousin to
marry me. She will not say yes or no, but a man cannot abandon even
a possible wife to the mercies of the Aiel, and she will not
leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Caraline Damodred drew herself up on her saddle, face
cold enough to shame an Aes Sedai, but suddenly auras of red and
white flashed around her and Darlin, and Min knew. The colors never
seemed to matter, but she knew that they would marry&mdash;after
Caraline had led him a merry chase. More, to her eyes a crown
suddenly appeared on Darlin&rsquo;s head, a simple golden circlet
with a slightly curved sword lying on its side above his brows. The
king&rsquo;s crown he would wear one day, though of what country,
she could not say. Tear had High Lords instead of a king.</p>

<p>Image and auras vanished as Darlin pulled his horse
around to face Caraline. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no game to be found today.
Toram has already returned to camp. I suggest we do the same.&rdquo;
Those blue eyes scanned the surrounding trees quickly. &ldquo;It seems
your cousin and his wife have lost their horses. They will wander,
in a careless moment,&rdquo; he added to Rand, in a kindly tone. He knew
very well they had no horses. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m sure Rovair and Ines
will give up their mounts. A walk in the air will do them
good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stout man in the red-striped coat swung down from
his tall bay immediately, with a toadying smile for Darlin and one
markedly less warm if just as greasy for Rand. The angry-faced
woman was a moment later in climbing stiffly from her silver-gray
mare. She did not look pleased.</p>

<p>Neither was Min. &ldquo;You mean to go into their camp?&rdquo;
she whispered as Rand led her to the horses. &ldquo;Are you mad?&rdquo; she
added before thinking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; he said softly, touching her nose with the
tip of one finger. &ldquo;Thanks to you, I know that.&rdquo; And he boosted her
onto the mare, then climbed into the bay&rsquo;s saddle and heeled
the animal up beside Darlin.</p>

<p>Heading north and a little toward the west, across
the slope, they left Rovair and Ines standing beneath the trees
frowning at one another sourly. As they fell in behind with the
Cairhienin, the other Tairens shouted laughing wishes that the pair
would enjoy the walk.</p>

<p>Min would have ridden alongside Rand, but Caraline
put a hand on her arm, drawing her in back of the two men. &ldquo;I want
to see what he does,&rdquo; Caraline said quietly. Which one, Min
wondered. &ldquo;You are his lover?&rdquo; Caraline asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Min told her defiantly, once she could catch a
breath. Her cheeks felt like fire. But the woman only nodded, as if
it were the most natural thing in the world. Maybe it was, in
Cairhien. Sometimes she realized that all the sophistication she
had picked up talking to worldly people was about as thick as her
blouse.</p>

<p>Rand and Darlin rode knee to knee just ahead, the
younger man half a head taller than the older, each wrapped in
pride like a cloak. But talking, just the same. Listening was not
easy. They spoke quietly, and the dead leaves rustling under the
horses&rsquo; hooves, fallen branches cracking, often was enough to
muffle their words. The cry of a hawk overhead or the chattering of
a squirrel in a tree drowned them. Still, it was possible to
overhear snatches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I may say so, Tomas,&rdquo; Darlin said at one point,
as they headed down after the first rise, &ldquo;and under the Light I
offer no disrespect, you are fortunate in having a beautiful wife.
The Light willing, I will have one as beautiful myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do they not speak of something important?&rdquo;
Caraline muttered.</p>

<p>Min turned her head to hide a small smile. The Lady
Caraline did not look half as displeased as she sounded. She
herself had never cared whether anyone thought her pretty or not.
Well, until she met Rand, anyway. Maybe Darlin&rsquo;s nose was not
all that long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would have let him take <em>Callandor</em> from
the Stone,&rdquo; Darlin said some time later, as they climbed a sparsely
treed slope, &ldquo;but I could not stand aside when he brought Aiel
invaders into Tear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read the Prophecies of the Dragon,&rdquo; Rand
said, leaning forward on the bay&rsquo;s neck and urging the animal
on. A fine glossy appearance the horse had, but no more bottom than
his owner, Min suspected. &ldquo;The Stone had to fall before he could
take <em>Callandor</em>,&rdquo; Rand continued. &ldquo;Other Tairen lords
follow him, so I hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Darlin snorted. &ldquo;They cringe and lick his boots! I
could have followed, if that was what he wanted, if&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; With a
sigh, he shook his head. &ldquo;Too many ifs, Tomas. There is a saying in
Tear. &lsquo;Any quarrel can be forgiven, but kings never
forget.&rsquo; Tear has not been under a king since Artur Hawkwing,
but I think the Dragon Reborn is very like a king. No, he has
attainted me with treason, as he calls it, and I must go on as I
began. The Light willing, I may see Tear sovereign on its own land
once more before I die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It had to be <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> work, Min knew.
The man would never have spoken this way to someone casually met,
Caraline Damodred&rsquo;s supposed cousin or not. But what did Rand
think? She could hardly wait to tell him about the crown.</p>

<p>Topping that hill, they suddenly came on a knot of
spearmen, some with a dented breastplate or helmet, most without
either, who bowed as soon they saw the party. To left and right
through the trees, Min could see other groups of sentries. Below,
the camp lay spread out in what seemed a permanent haze of dust,
down a nearly treeless slope and across the hill-valley and up the
next hill. Each of the few tents was large, with some noble&rsquo;s
banner hanging limply on a staff above the peak. Almost as many
horses stood tied to picket lines as there were people, and
thousands of men and a handful of women wandered among the
cookfires and wagons. None raised a cheer as their leaders rode
in.</p>

<p>Min studied them over the handkerchief she pressed to
her nose against the dust, not caring whether Caraline saw what she
was doing. Dispirited faces watched them pass, and grim faces,
people who knew they were in a trap. Here and there a House&rsquo;s
<em>con</em> stood stiffly above some man&rsquo;s head, yet most
seemed to be wearing whatever they could find, bits and pieces of
armor that often neither matched nor fitted very well. A good many,
though, men too tall for Cairhien, wore red coats under their
battered breastplates. Min eyed a nearly obscured white lion worked
on a filthy red sleeve. Darlin could only have brought a few people
with him on a longboat, perhaps no more than his hunting party.
Caraline looked to neither side as they rode through the camp, but
whenever they came near those men in red coats, her mouth
tightened.</p>

<p>Darlin dismounted before a tremendous tent, the
largest Min had ever seen, larger than any she had ever imagined, a
great red-striped oval, shining in the sunlight like silk, with no
fewer than four high conical peaks, each with the Rising Sun of
Cairhien stirring above in a lazy breeze, gold on blue. The
strumming of harps drifted out amid the murmur of voices, like the
sounds of geese. As servants took away the horses, Darlin offered
his arm to Caraline. After a very long pause, she laid her fingers
lightly on his wrist with no expression whatsoever, letting him
escort her inside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lady wife?&rdquo; Rand murmured with a smile, extending
his arm.</p>

<p>Min sniffed and put her hand atop his. She would
rather have hit him. He had no right to make a joke of that. He had
no right to bring her here, <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> or no <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>. He could be killed here, burn him! But did he
care if she spent the rest of her life weeping? She touched one of
the striped doorflaps as they went in, and shook her head in
wonder. It <em>was</em> silk. A <em>silk</em> tent!</p>

<p>No sooner were they inside than she felt Rand
stiffen. Darlin&rsquo;s shrunken retinue and Caraline&rsquo;s jostled
around them with insincere murmurs of apology. Between the four
main tentpoles, long trestle tables groaning with food and drink
stood about the colorful carpets that had been laid for a floor,
and there were people everywhere, Cairhienin nobles in their
finery, a few soldiers with the fronts of their heads shaved and
powdered, plainly men of high rank by the fine cut of their coats.
A handful of bards strolled playing through the crowd, picked out
as much by a loftier air than any noble as by the carved and gilded
harps they carried. Yet Min&rsquo;s eyes flew as if pulled to the
sure source of Rand&rsquo;s worry, three Aes Sedai talking together
in shawls fringed green and brown and gray. Images and colors
flashed around them, but not a thing she could make sense of. A
swirl in the crowd revealed another, a comfortably round-faced
woman. More images, more flaring colors, but all Min needed was the
red-fringed shawl looped over her plump arms.</p>

<p>Rand tucked her hand under his arm and patted it. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;Everything is going well.&rdquo; She
would have asked him what they were doing there, but she was afraid
he would tell her.</p>

<p>Darlin and Caraline had vanished into the crowd along
with their followers, yet as a bowing serving man with stripes of
red, green and white on his dark cuffs offered a tray of silver
goblets to Rand and Min, she reappeared, shaking off the
importunings of a hatchet-faced fellow in one of those red coats.
He glared at her back as she took a goblet of punch and waved the
servant away, and Min&rsquo;s breath caught at the aura that
suddenly flashed around him, bruised hues so dark they seemed
nearly black.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trust that man, Lady Caraline.&rdquo; She could
not stop herself. &ldquo;He will murder anyone he thinks is in his way;
he&rsquo;ll kill for a whim, kill anybody.&rdquo; She clamped her teeth
shut before saying more.</p>

<p>Caraline glanced over her shoulder as the
hatchet-faced man turned away abruptly. &ldquo;I could believe it easily
of Daved Hanlon,&rdquo; she said wryly. &ldquo;His White Lions fight for gold,
not Cairhien, and loot worse than the Aiel. Andor became too hot
for them, it seems.&rdquo; That with an arch glance at Rand. &ldquo;Toram has
promised him a great deal of gold, I think, and estates I know.&rdquo;
She tilted her eyes up to Min. &ldquo;Do you know the man, Jaisi?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min could only shake her head. How to explain what
she did know about Hanlon now, that his hands would be red with
more rapes and murders before he died? If she had known when or who&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;But all she knew was that he would. Anyway, telling about a
viewing never changed it; what she saw happened, no matter who she
warned. Sometimes, before she had learned better, it had happened
because she warned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of the White Lions,&rdquo; Rand said
coldly. &ldquo;Look among them for Darkfriends, and you won&rsquo;t be
disappointed.&rdquo; They had been some of Gaebril&rsquo;s soldiers; Min
knew that much, and little more, except that Lord Gaebril had
really been Rahvin. It stood to reason that soldiers serving one of
the Forsaken would include Darkfriends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What of him?&rdquo; Rand nodded toward a man across the
tent whose long dark coat had as many stripes as Caraline&rsquo;s
dress. Very tall for a Cairhienin, perhaps less than a full head
shorter than Rand, he was slender except for broad shoulders, and
strikingly good-looking, with a strong chin and just a touch of
gray at his dark temples. For some reason, Min&rsquo;s eyes were
drawn to his companion, a skinny little fellow with a large nose
and wide ears, in a red silk coat that did not fit him very well.
He kept fingering a curved dagger at his belt, a fancy piece with a
golden sheath and a large red stone capping the hilt that seemed to
catch the light darkly. She saw no auras around him. He seemed
vaguely familiar. They were both looking at her and Rand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; Caraline breathed in a tight voice, &ldquo;is Lord
Toram Riatin himself. And his constant companion these past days,
Master Jeraal Mordeth. Odious little man. His eyes make me want to
take a bath. They both make me feel unclean.&rdquo; She blinked,
surprised at what she had said, but recovered quickly. Min had the
feeling little put Caraline Damodred off her stride for long. In
that, she was very like Moiraine. &ldquo;I would be careful were I you,
Cousin Tomas,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;You may have wrought some miracle or
<em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>-work on me&mdash;and perhaps even on Darlin&mdash;though I cannot say what it might come to&mdash;I make no
promises&mdash;but Toram hates you with a passion. It was not so
bad before Mordeth joined him, yet since&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Toram would have us
attack the city immediately, in the night. With you dead, he says,
the Aiel would go, but I think it is you dead he seeks now even
more than he does the throne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mordeth,&rdquo; Rand said. His eyes were locked to Toram
Riatin and the skinny fellow. &ldquo;His name is Padan Fain, and there
are one hundred thousand golden crowns on his head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Caraline nearly dropped her goblet. &ldquo;Queens have been
ransomed for less. What did he do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He ravaged my home because it was my home.&rdquo;
Rand&rsquo;s face was frozen, his voice ice. &ldquo;He brought Trollocs to
kill my friends because they were my friends. He is a Darkfriend,
and a dead man.&rdquo; Those last words came through clenched teeth.
Punch splashed to the carpet as the silver goblet bent in his
gloved fist.</p>

<p>Min felt sick for him, for his pain&mdash;she had
heard what Fain had done in the Two Rivers&mdash;but she put a
hand on Rand&rsquo;s chest in near panic. If he gave way now,
channeled with who knew how many Aes Sedai around&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;For the
Light&rsquo;s sake, take hold of yourself,&rdquo; she began, and a
woman&rsquo;s voice spoke pleasantly behind her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you present me to your tall young friend,
Caraline?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min looked over her shoulder, right into an ageless
face, cool-eyed beneath iron-gray hair pulled up into a bun from
which dangled small golden ornaments. Swallowing a squeak, Min
coughed. She had thought Caraline had taken her in in one glance,
but these cool eyes seemed to know things about her she herself had
forgotten. The Aes Sedai&rsquo;s smile, as she adjusted her
green-fringed shawl, was not nearly so pleasant as her voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, Cadsuane Sedai.&rdquo; Caraline sounded shaken,
but she smoothed her tone well before she finished introducing her
visiting &ldquo;cousin&rdquo; and his &ldquo;wife.&rdquo; &ldquo;But I fear Cairhien is no place
for them at present,&rdquo; she said, all self-possession once more,
smiling regret that she could not keep Rand and Min longer. &ldquo;They
have agreed to take my advice and return to Andor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have they?&rdquo; Cadsuane said dryly. Min&rsquo;s heart
sank. Even if Rand had not spoken of her, it was clear from the way
she looked at him that she knew him. Tiny golden birds and moons
and stars swayed as she shook her head. &ldquo;Most boys learn not to
stick their fingers into the pretty fire the first time they are
burned, Tomas. Others need to be spanked, to learn. Better a tender
bottom than a seared hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m no child,&rdquo; Rand told her
sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I?&rdquo; She eyed him from head to toe, and made it
seem no very great distance. &ldquo;Well, it seems I shall soon see
whether or not you need spanking.&rdquo; Those cool eyes drifted to Min,
to Caraline, and with a final hitch to her shawl, Cadsuane herself
drifted away into the crowd.</p>

<p>Min swallowed the lump in her throat, and was pleased
to see Caraline do the same, self-possession or no. Rand&mdash;the
blind fool!&mdash;stared after the Aes Sedai as though intending
to go after her. This time it was Caraline who laid a hand on
Rand&rsquo;s chest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I take it you know Cadsuane,&rdquo; she said breathily. &ldquo;Be careful of her; even the other sisters stand in awe of her.&rdquo;
Her throaty tones took on a note of gravity. &ldquo;I have no idea what
will come of today, but whatever it is, I think it is time you were
gone, &lsquo;Cousin Tomas.&rsquo; Past time. I will have horses&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is your cousin, Caraline?&rdquo; said a deep, rich
man&rsquo;s voice, and Min jumped in spite of herself.</p>

<p>Toram Riatin was even better-looking close up than at
a distance, with the sort of strong male beauty and air of worldly
knowledge that would have attracted Min before she met Rand. Well,
she still found them attractive, just not as much as she did Rand.
His firm-lipped smile was quite appealing.</p>

<p>Toram&rsquo;s gaze fell to Caraline&rsquo;s hand, still
on Rand&rsquo;s chest. &ldquo;The Lady Caraline is to be my wife,&rdquo; he said
lazily. &ldquo;Did you know that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Caraline&rsquo;s cheeks reddened angrily. &ldquo;Do not say
that, Toram! I have told you I will not, and I will not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toram smiled at Rand. &ldquo;I think women never know their
minds until you show them. What do you think, Jeraal? Jeraal?&rdquo; He
looked around, scowling. Min stared at him in amazement. And he was
so pretty, with just the right air of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She wished she could
call up viewings at will. She very much wanted to know what the
future held for this man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw your friend scurry off that way, Toram.&rdquo; Mouth
twisted with distaste, Caraline gave a vague wave of her hand. &ldquo;You
will find him near the drink, I think, or else bothering the
serving girls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Later, my precious.&rdquo; He tried to touch her cheek,
and looked amused when she stepped back. Without a pause he
transferred his amusement to Rand. And the sword at his side. &ldquo;Would you care for a little sport, cousin? I call you that because
we will be cousins, once Caraline is my wife. With practice swords,
of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; Caraline laughed. &ldquo;He is a boy,
Toram, and scarce knows one end of that thing from the other. His
mother would never forgive me, if I allowed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sport,&rdquo; Rand said abruptly. &ldquo;I might as well see
where this leads. I agree.&rdquo;</p>
