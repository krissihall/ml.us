<h4><em>Insects</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">C</span>arridin
did not look up immediately from the letter
he was writing when the Lady Shiaine, as she called herself, was
shown in. Three ants struggled futilely in the wet ink, trapped.
Everything else might be dying, but ants and cockroaches and every
sort of vermin seemed to thrive. Carefully he pressed the blotter
down. He was not about to begin again for a few ants. A failure to
send this report, or a report of failure, might doom him as surely
as those mired insects, yet it was fear of a different failure that
tightened his guts.</p>

<p>He had no worry of Shiaine reading what he wrote. It
was in a cipher known to only two men beside himself. So many bands
of &ldquo;Dragonsworn&rdquo; at work, each stiffened by a core of his most
trusted men, so many more who might be bandits or even truly sworn
to that filth, al&rsquo;Thor. Pedron Niall might not like that last,
but his command had been to plunge Altara and Murandy into blood
and chaos from which only Niall and the Children of the Light could
rescue them, a madness clearly to be laid at the feet of this
so-called Dragon Reborn, and that he had done. Fear held both
countries by the throat. Tales that the witches marched across the
same country were an added reward. Tar Valon witches and
Dragonsworn, Aes Sedai carrying off young women and setting up
false Dragons, villages in flames and men nailed to the doors of
their barns&mdash;it was all one in half the street rumors, now.
Niall would be pleased. And send more orders. How he expected
Carridin to snatch Elayne Trakand out of the Tarasin Palace was
beyond reason.</p>

<p>Another ant skittered across the ivory-inlaid table
onto the page, and his thumb stabbed down, destroying it. And
smearing a word to illegibility. The entire report would need to be
redone. He wanted a drink very badly. There was brandy in a crystal
flask on the table by the door, but he did not want the woman to
see him drinking. Suppressing a sigh, he shoved the letter aside
and pulled a kerchief from his sleeve to wipe his hand. &ldquo;So,
Shiaine, do you finally have progress to report? Or have you just
come for more money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She smiled at him lazily from a tall carved armchair. &ldquo;There are expenses associated with a search,&rdquo; she said in almost
the accents of an Andoran noble. &ldquo;Especially when we want no
questions asked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Most people would have been unsettled by the sight of
Jaichim Carridin, even cleaning a pen nib, with his steely face and
deep-set eyes, the white tabard over his coat bearing the golden
sunburst of the Children of the Light impressed upon the crimson
shepherd&rsquo;s crook of the Hand. Not Mili Skane. That was her
real name, though she did not know he knew. A saddler&rsquo;s
daughter from a village near Whitebridge, she had gone to the White
Tower at fifteen, another thing she thought secret. It was hardly
the best start, becoming a Friend of the Dark because the witches
told her she could not learn to channel, but before that year was
out she had not only found a circle in Caemlyn but made her first
kill. In the seven years since, she had added nineteen more. She
was one of the best assassins available, and a hunter who could
find anyone or anything. That much he had been told when she was
sent to him. A circle reported to her now. Several of them actually
were nobles and almost all were older, but neither thing mattered
among those who served the Great Lord. Another circle working for
Carridin was led by a gnarled beggar with one eye, no teeth and a
habit of bathing only once in the year. Had circumstances been
different, Carridin himself would have knelt to Old Cully, the only
name the stinking villain admitted to. Mili Skane surely groveled
for Old Cully, and so did every last companion of her circle, noble
or not. It irritated Carridin that &ldquo;Lady Shiaine&rdquo; would be on her
knees in a flash if the straggly-haired old beggar entered the
room, but for him sat with her legs crossed, smiling and twitching
her slippered foot as if impatient to be done. She had been ordered
to obey him absolutely, by one even Old Cully would grovel for, and
besides, he had a desperate need of success. Niall&rsquo;s schemes
could go to dust, but not this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many things can be excused,&rdquo; he said, laying the pen
on its ivory stand and shoving back his chair, &ldquo;for those who
accomplish the tasks they are given.&rdquo; He was a tall man, and he
loomed threateningly. He was well aware that the gilt-framed
mirrors on the wall showed a figure of strength, a dangerous man. &ldquo;Even dresses and baubles and gambling, paid for with coin that was
to go for information.&rdquo; That twitching foot froze for instant, then
began again, but her smile was forced, her face pale. Her circle
obeyed her instantly, but they would string her up by the heels and
skin her alive if he spoke the word. &ldquo;You have not accomplished
very much, have you? In fact, you do not seem to have accomplished
anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are difficulties, as you well know,&rdquo; she said
breathily. She managed to meet his eyes squarely, though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuses. Tell me of difficulties surmounted, not
those you stumble over and fall. You can fall a long way if you
fail in this.&rdquo; Turning his back, he strode to the nearest window.
He could fall a long way, too, and he did not want to risk her
seeing anything in his eyes. Sunlight slanted through the ornate
stone screen. The high-ceilinged room, with its
green-and-white-tiled floor and bright blue walls, stayed
comparatively cool behind the thick walls of the palace, but the
heat outside seeped in near the windows. He could almost feel the
brandy across the room. He could not wait for her to be gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord Carridin, how can I have anyone ask too
openly about objects of the Power? That <em>will</em> cause
questions, and there are Aes Sedai in the city, you will
recall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peering down at the street through the
scroll-carvings, he wrinkled his nose at the smell. Every sort was
jammed together down there. An Arafellin with his hair in two long
braids and a curved sword on his back tossed a coin to a one-armed
beggar, who scowled at the gift before tucking it under his rags
and resuming his piteous cries to the passersby. A fellow in a
torn, bright red coat and even brighter yellow breeches came
running from a shop clutching a bolt of cloth to his chest, pursued
by a shouting pale-haired woman who had her skirts pulled above her
knees and was outpacing the burly guard who lumbered behind her
waving his truncheon. The driver of a red-lacquered coach with the
moneylenders&rsquo; gold coins and open hand on the door shook his
whip at the driver of a canvas-covered wagon whose team had become
entangled with the coach&rsquo;s, the man filling the street with
curses. Grimy street urchins crouched behind a dilapidated cart
while they snatched puny, shriveled fruit brought in from the
country. A Taraboner woman pushed her way through the crowd,
veiled, her dark hair in thin braids, drawing every male eye in her
dusty red dress that shaped itself to her form shamelessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord, I must have time. I <em>must</em>! I cannot
do the impossible, certainly not in days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trash, all of them. Grubbers for gold and Hunters for
the Horn, thieves, refugees, even Tinkers. Scum. Riots would be
easy to start, a purge for all this filth. Outlanders were always
the first targets, always to blame for whatever was wrong, along
with neighbors who had the misfortune to be on the wrong side of
grudges, women who peddled herbs and cures, and folk with no
friends, especially if they lived alone. Properly guided, as
carefully as such things could be, a good riot might well burn the
Tarasin Palace down around that useless jade Tylin and the witches
as well. He glared at the swarm below. Riots did tend to get out of
hand; the Civil Guard might stir itself, and inevitably a handful
of true Friends would be snapped up. He could not afford the chance
that some of those might be from the circles he had hunting. For
that matter, even a few days of rioting would disrupt their work.
Tylin was not important enough for that; she did not matter at all,
in truth. No, not yet. Niall, he could afford to disappoint, but
not his true master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord Carridin&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; A note of defiance had
entered Shiaine&rsquo;s voice. He had let her stew too long. &ldquo;My
Lord Carridin, some of my circle question why we are looking for&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He started to turn, to put her down hard&mdash;he
needed success, not excuses, not questions!&mdash;but her voice
dwindled to nothing as his eyes fell on a young man standing
diagonally across the street, in a blue coat with enough
red-and-gold embroidery on the sleeves and lapels for two nobles.
Taller than most, he was fanning himself with a broad-brimmed black
hat and adjusting his neck scarf as he spoke to a stooped,
white-haired man. Carridin recognized the young man.</p>

<p>Suddenly he felt as though a knotted rope had been
fastened around his head and was being drawn ever tighter. For an
instant a face hidden behind a red mask filled his vision.
Night-dark eyes stared at him, and then were endless caverns of
flame, and still staring. Within his head, the world exploded in
fire, cascading images that battered him and swept him beyond
screaming. The forms of three young men stood unsupported in air,
and one of them began to glow, the form of the man in the street,
brighter and brighter till it must have seared any living eyes to
ash, brighter still, burning. A curled golden horn sped toward him,
its cry pulling his soul, then flashed into a ring of golden light,
swallowing him, chilling him until the last fragment of him that
recalled his name was sure his bones must splinter. A ruby-tipped
dagger hurdled straight at him, curved blade striking him between
the eyes and sinking in, in, until gold-wrapped hilt and all was
gone, and he knew agony that washed away all thought that what had
gone before was pain. He would have prayed to a Creator he had long
abandoned if he remembered how. He would have shrieked if he
remembered how, if he remembered that humans shrieked, that he was
human. On and on, more and more&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Raising a hand to his forehead, he wondered why it
trembled. His head ached, too. There had been something&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He
gave a start at the street below. Everything was changed in the
blink of an eye, the people different, wagons moved, colorful
coaches and chairs replaced by others. Worse, Cauthon was gone. He
wanted to swallow that whole flask of brandy in one gulp.</p>

<p>Suddenly he realized that Shiaine had stopped
talking. He turned, ready to continue putting her in her place.</p>

<p>She was leaning forward in the act of rising, one
hand on the arm of her chair, the other raised in a gesture. Her
narrow face was fixed in petulant defiance, but not at Carridin.
She did not move. She did not blink. He was not sure she breathed.
He barely noticed her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ruminating?&rdquo; Sammael said. &ldquo;Can I at least hope that
it is about what you are here to find for me?&rdquo; He stood only a
little taller than average, a muscular, solid man in a coat of the
high-collared Illianer style, so covered with gold-work it was hard
to tell the cloth was green, but more than being one of the Chosen
gave him stature. His blue eyes were colder than winter&rsquo;s
heart. A livid scar burned down his face from golden hairline to
the edge of golden, square-cut beard, and it seemed a suitable
decoration. Whatever got in his way was brushed aside, trampled or
obliterated. Carridin knew Sammael would have turned his bowels to
water if the man had been just someone met by chance.</p>

<p>Hurriedly moving from the window, he dropped to his
knees before the Chosen. He despised the Tar Valon witches; indeed,
he despised anyone who used the One Power, meddling with what had
broken the world once, wielding what mere mortals should not touch.
This man used the Power, too, but the Chosen could not be called
mere mortals. Perhaps not mortals at all. And if he served well,
neither would he be. &ldquo;Great Master, I saw Mat Cauthon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here?&rdquo; Oddly, for a moment, Sammael seemed taken
aback. He murmured something under his breath, and the blood
drained from Carridin&rsquo;s face at one caught word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great Lord, you know I would never betray&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You? Fool! You haven&rsquo;t the stomach. Are you
certain it was Cauthon you saw?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Great Master. In the street. I know I can find
him again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sammael frowned down at him, stroking his beard,
looking through and beyond Jaichim Carridin. Carridin did not like
feeling insignificant, especially when he knew it was true.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Sammael said finally. &ldquo;Your search is the most
important thing, the <em>only</em> thing, so far as you are
concerned. Cauthon&rsquo;s death would be convenient, certainly, but
not if it draws attention here. If it appears that attention is
already here, should he take an interest in your search, then he
dies, but otherwise, he can wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you mishear me?&rdquo; Sammael&rsquo;s scar pulled his
smile into a snarl on one side. &ldquo;I saw your sister Vanora recently.
She did not look well, at first. Screaming and weeping, twitching
constantly and pulling at her hair. Women do suffer worse than men
from the attentions of Myrddraal, but even Myrddraal must find
their pleasures somewhere. Don&rsquo;t worry that she suffered too
long. The Trollocs are always hungry.&rdquo; The smile faded; his voice
was stone. &ldquo;Those who disobey can find themselves over a cookfire,
too. Vanora seemed to be smiling, Carridin. Do you think you would
smile, turning on a spit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carridin swallowed in spite of himself, and quelled a
pang for Vanora, with her ready laugh and her skill with horses,
daring to gallop where others feared to walk. She had been his
favorite sister, yet she was dead and he was not. If there were any
mercies in the world, she had not learned why. &ldquo;I live to serve
and obey, Great Master.&rdquo; He did not believe he was a coward, but no
one disobeyed one of the Chosen. Not more than once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then find what I want!&rdquo; Sammael roared. &ldquo;I know
it&rsquo;s hidden somewhere in this <em>kjasic</em> flyspeck of a
city! <em>Ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, <em>angreal</em>, even <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>! I have tracked them, traced them! Now you
find them, Carridin. Do not make me grow impatient.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great Master&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He worked his mouth to find
moisture. &ldquo;Great Master, there are witches&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Aes Sedai&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;here. I cannot be sure how many. If they hear a whisper&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Waving him to silence, Sammael paced a few quick
steps, three times up and back, hands clasped behind his back. He
did not look worried, only&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;considering. Finally he nodded. &ldquo;I
will send you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;someone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to deal with these <em>Aes
Sedai</em>.&rdquo; He barked a short laugh. &ldquo;I almost wish I could see
their faces. Very well. You have a little while longer. Then
perhaps someone else will have a chance.&rdquo; He lifted a strand of
Shiaine&rsquo;s hair with a finger; she still did not move; her eyes
stared unblinking. &ldquo;This child would certainly leap at the
opportunity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carridin fought down a stab of fear. The Chosen cast
down as quickly as they raised up, and as often. Failure never went
unpunished. &ldquo;Great Master, the favor I asked of you. If I might
know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Have you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;will you&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is very little luck in you, Carridin,&rdquo; Sammael
said with another smile. &ldquo;You had better hope you have more
carrying out my orders. It seems that someone is making sure at
least some of Ishmael&rsquo;s commands are still carried out.&rdquo; He
was smiling, but he seemed far from amused. Or perhaps it was just
the scar. &ldquo;You failed him, and you&rsquo;ve lost your entire family
for it. Only my hand protects you, now. Once, long ago, I saw three
Myrddraal make a man give them his wife and his daughters one by
one, then beg them to cut off his right leg, then the left, then
his arms, and burn out his eyes.&rdquo; The perfectly ordinary
conversational tone made the recitation worse than any shouts or
snarls ever could have. &ldquo;It was a game with them, you understand,
to see how much they could make him beg them to take. They left his
tongue for last, of course, but there wasn&rsquo;t a great deal of
him remaining by then. He had been quite powerful, handsome and
famous. Envied. No one would ever envy what they finally tossed to
the Trollocs. You wouldn&rsquo;t believe the sounds it made. Find
what I want, Carridin. You will not like it if I withdraw my
hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly there was a vertical line of light in the
air before the Chosen. It seemed to turn in some fashion, widening
as it did into a square&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;hole. Carridin gaped. He was staring
through a hole in the air, at somewhere full of gray columns and
thick mist. Sammael stepped through, and the opening snapped shut,
a brilliant bar of light that vanished, leaving only a purple
afterimage glowing in Carridin&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>Unsteadily, he pushed himself to his feet. Failure
was always punished, but no one survived disobeying one of the
Chosen.</p>

<p>Suddenly Shiaine moved, completing her halted rise
from the chair. &ldquo;You mark me, <em>Bors</em>,&rdquo; she began, then cut
off, staring at the window where he had been standing. Her eyes
darted, found him, and she jumped. He could have been one of the
Chosen himself from the way those eyes bulged.</p>

<p>No one survived disobeying the Chosen. He pressed his
hands against his temples. His head felt tight to bursting. &ldquo;There
is a man in the city, Mat Cauthon. You will&mdash;&rdquo; She gave a
small start, and he frowned. &ldquo;You know him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard the name,&rdquo; she said warily. And
angrily, he would have said. &ldquo;Few linked to al&rsquo;Thor remain
unknown for long.&rdquo; As he stepped closer, she crossed her arms
protectively in front of herself, and held her place with an
obvious effort. &ldquo;What is a seedy farmboy doing in Ebou Dar? How did
he&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother me with foolish questions,
Shiaine.&rdquo; His head had never hurt like this; never. It felt as
though a dagger was being driven into his skull between his eyes.
No one survived&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;You will put your circle to locating Cauthon
immediately. All of them.&rdquo; Old Cully was coming tonight, slipping
in through the back of the stables; she did not need to know there
would be others. &ldquo;Nothing else is to get in the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She broke off with a gasp as he seized her neck. A
slim dagger appeared in her hand, but he wrenched it away. She
twisted and jerked, but he drove her face down onto the table, her
cheek smudging still-damp ink on the discarded letter to Pedron
Niall. The dagger, stabbing down just in front of her eyes, froze
her. By chance, the blade piercing the paper had caught an ant by
the tip of one leg. It struggled as vainly as she had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are an insect, Mili.&rdquo; The pain in his head made
his voice rasp. &ldquo;It is time you understand that. One insect is much
like another, and if one won&rsquo;t do&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Her eyes followed
his thumb down, and when it flattened on the ant, she flinched.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I live to serve and obey, master,&rdquo; she breathed. She
had said that to Old Cully every time he saw them together, but
never before to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And this is how you will obey&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; No one survived
disobedience. No one.</p>
