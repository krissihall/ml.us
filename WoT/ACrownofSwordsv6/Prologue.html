<p class="prophecy">There can be no health in us, nor any good thing
grow, for the land is one with the Dragon Reborn, and he one with
the land. Soul of fire, heart of stone, in pride he conquers,
forcing the proud to yield. He calls upon the mountains to kneel,
and the seas to give way, and the very skies to bow. Pray that the
heart of stone remembers tears, and the soul of fire, love.</p>

the tall arched window, close onto eighty spans
above the ground, not far below the top of the White Tower, Elaida
could see for miles beyond Tar Valon, to the rolling plains and
forests that bordered the broad River Erinin, running down from
north and west before it divided around the white walls of the
great island city. On the ground, long morning shadows must have
been dappling the city, but from this prominence all seemed clear
and bright. Not even the fabled &ldquo;topless towers&rdquo; of Cairhien had
truly rivaled the White Tower. Certainly none of Tar Valon&rsquo;s
lesser towers did, for all that men spoke far and wide of them and
their vaulting sky-bridges.</p>

<p>This high, an almost constant breeze lessened the
unnatural heat gripping the world. The Feast of Lights past, snow
should have covered the ground deep, yet the weather belonged in
the depths of a hard summer. Another sign that the Last Battle
approached and the Dark One touched the world, if more were needed.
Elaida did not let the heat touch her even when she descended, of
course. The breeze was not why she had had her quarters moved up
here, despite the inconvenience of so many stairs, to these simple
rooms.</p>

<p>Plain russet floor tiles and white marble walls
decorated by a few tapestries could not compare with the grandeur
of the Amyrlin&rsquo;s study and the rooms that went with it far
below. She still used those rooms occasionally&mdash;they held
associations with the power of the Amyrlin Seat in some minds&mdash;but she resided here, and worked here more often than not.
For the view. Not of city or river or forests, though. Of what was
beginning in the Tower grounds.</p>

<p>Great diggings and foundations spread across what had
been the Warders&rsquo; practice yard, tall wooden cranes and stacks
of cut marble and granite. Masons and laborers swarmed over the
workings like ants, and endless streams of wagons trailed through
the gates onto the Tower grounds, bringing more stone. To one side
stood a wooden &ldquo;working model,&rdquo; as the masons called it, big enough
for men to enter crouching on their heels and see every detail,
where every stone should go. Most of the workmen could not read,
after all&mdash;neither words nor mason&rsquo;s drawn plans. The &ldquo;working model&rdquo; was as large as some manor houses.</p>

<p>When any king or queen had a palace, why should the
Amyrlin Seat be relegated to apartments little better than those of
many ordinary sisters? Her palace would match the White Tower for
splendor, and have a great spire ten spans higher than the Tower
itself. The blood had drained from the chief mason&rsquo;s face when
he heard that. The Tower had been Ogier-built, with assistance from
sisters using the Power. One look at Elaida&rsquo;s face, however,
set Master Lerman bowing and stammering that of course all would be
done as she wished. As if there had been any question.</p>

<p>Her mouth tightened with exasperation. She had wanted
Ogier masons again, but the Ogier were confining themselves to
their <em>stedding</em> for some reason. Her summons to the
nearest, Stedding Jentoine, in the Black Hills, had been met with
refusal. Polite, yet still refusal, without explanation, even to
the Amyrlin Seat. Ogier were reclusive at best. Or they might be
withdrawing from a world full of turmoil; Ogier stayed clear of
human strife.</p>

<p>Firmly Elaida dismissed the Ogier from her mind. She
prided herself on separating what could be from what could not.
Ogier were a triviality. They had no part in the world beyond the
cities they had built so long ago and seldom visited now except to
make repairs.</p>

<p>The men below, crawling beetle-like over the building
site, made her frown slightly. Construction went forward by inches.
Ogier might be out of the question, yet perhaps the One Power could
be used again. Few sisters possessed real strength in weaving
Earth, but not that much was required to reinforce stone, or bind
stone to stone. Yes. In her mind, the palace stood finished,
colonnaded walks and great domes shining with gilt and that one
spire reaching to the heavens&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Her eyes rose to the cloudless
sky, to where the spire would peak, and she let out a long sigh.
Yes. The orders would be issued today.</p>

<p>The towering case clock in the room behind her chimed
Third Rise, and in the city gongs and bells pealed the hour, the
sound faint here, so high above. With a smile, Elaida left the
window, smoothing her red-slashed dress of cream silk and adjusting
the broad, striped stole of the Amyrlin Seat on her shoulders.</p>

<p>On the ornately gilded clock, small figures of gold
and silver and enamel moved with the chimes. Horned and snouted
Trollocs fled from a cloaked Aes Sedai on one level; on another a
man representing a false Dragon tried to fend off silver lightning
bolts that had obviously been hurled by a second sister. And above
the clockface, itself above her head, a crowned king and queen
knelt before an Amyrlin Seat in her enameled stole, with the Flame
of Tar Valon, carved from a large moonstone, atop a golden arch
over her head.</p>

<p>She did not laugh often, but she could not help a
quietly pleased chuckle at the clock. Cemaile Sorenthaine, raised
from the Gray, had commissioned it dreaming of a return to the days
before the Trolloc Wars, when no ruler held a throne without the
Tower&rsquo;s approval. Cemaile&rsquo;s grand plans came to naught,
however, as did Cemaile, and for three centuries the clock sat in a
dusty storage room, an embarrassment no one dared display. Until
Elaida. The Wheel of Time turned. What was once, could be again.
<em>Would</em> be again.</p>

<p>The case clock balanced the door to her sitting room,
and her bedchamber and dressing room beyond. Fine tapestries,
colorful work from Tear and Kandor and Arad Doman, with
thread-of-gold and thread-of-silver glittering among the merely
dyed, hung each exactly opposite its mate. She had always liked
order. The carpet covering most of the tiles came from Tarabon,
patterned in red and green and gold; silk carpets were the most
precious. In each corner of the room a marble plinth carved in
unpretentious verticals held a white vase of fragile Sea Folk
porcelain with two dozen carefully arranged red roses. To make
roses bloom now required the One Power, especially with the drought
and heat; a worthwhile use, in her opinion. Gilded carving covered
both the only chair&mdash;<em>no</em> one sat in her presence now&mdash;and the writing table, but in the stark style of Cairhien. A
simple room, really, with a ceiling barely two spans high, yet it
would do until her palace was ready. With the view, it would.</p>

<p>The tall chairback held the Flame of Tar Valon picked
out in moonstones above her dark head as she sat. Nothing marred
the polished surface of the table except for three boxes of Altaran
lacquerwork, arranged just so. Opening the box covered with golden
hawks among white clouds, she removed a slim strip of thin paper
from atop the pile of reports and correspondence inside.</p>

<p>For what must have been the hundredth time, she read
the message come from Cairhien by pigeon twelve days ago. Few in
the Tower knew of its existence. None but she knew its contents, or
would have a glimmer of what it meant if they did. The thought
almost made her laugh again.</p>


<p class="note">The ring has been placed in the bull&rsquo;s nose. I
expect a pleasant journey to market.</p>

<p>No signature, yet she needed none. Only Galina Casban
had known to send that glorious message. Galina, whom Elaida
trusted to do what she would have trusted to no one else save
herself; Not that she trusted anyone fully, but the head of the Red
Ajah more than any other. She herself had been raised from the Red,
after all, and in many ways still thought of herself as Red.</p>

<p class="note">The ring has been placed in the bull&rsquo;s nose.</p>

<p>Rand al&rsquo;Thor&mdash;the Dragon Reborn, the man
who had seemed on the point of swallowing the world, the man who
had swallowed entirely too much of it&mdash;Rand al&rsquo;Thor was
shielded and in Galina&rsquo;s control. And none who might support
him knew. Even a chance of that, and the wording would have been
different. By various earlier messages, it seemed he had
rediscovered how to Travel, a Talent lost to Aes Sedai since the
Breaking, yet that had not saved him. It had even played into
Galina&rsquo;s hands. Apparently he had a habit of coming and going
without warning. Who would suspect that this time he had not gone,
but been taken? Something very like a giggle rose in her.</p>

<p>Inside another week, two at most, al&rsquo;Thor would
be in the Tower, closely supervised and guided safely until Tarmon
Gai&rsquo;don, his ravaging of the world stopped. It was madness to
allow any man who could channel to run free, but most of all the
man prophecy said must face the Dark One in the Last Battle, the
Light send that it lay years off yet in spite of the weather. Years
would be needed to arrange the world properly, beginning with
undoing what al&rsquo;Thor had done.</p>

<p>Of course, the damage he had wrought was nothing
beside what he could have caused, free. Not to mention the
possibility that he might have gotten himself killed before he was
needed. Well, that troublesome young man would be wrapped in
swaddling and kept safe as an infant in his mother&rsquo;s arms
until time to take him to Shayol Ghul. After that, if he survived&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elaida&rsquo;s lips pursed. The Prophecies of the
Dragon seemed to say he would not, which undeniably would be for
the best.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother?&rdquo; Elaida almost gave a start as Alviarin
spoke. Entering without so much as a knock! &ldquo;I have word from the
Ajahs, Mother.&rdquo; Slim and cool-faced, Alviarin wore the
Keeper&rsquo;s narrow stole in white, matching her dress, to show
she had been raised from the White, but in her mouth &lsquo;Mother&rsquo; became less a title of respect and more an
address to an equal.</p>

<p>Alviarin&rsquo;s presence was enough to dent
Elaida&rsquo;s good mood. That the Keeper of Chronicles came from
the White, not the Red, always served as a biting reminder of her
weakness when she was first raised. Some of that had been
dispelled, true, but not all. Not yet. She was tired of regretting
that she had so few personal eyes-and-ears outside Andor. And that
her predecessor and Alviarin&rsquo;s had escaped&mdash;been helped
to escape; they must have had help!&mdash;escaped before the keys
to the Amyrlin&rsquo;s great network could be wrested out of
them.</p>

<p>She more than wanted the network that was hers by
right. By strong tradition the Ajahs sent to the Keeper whatever
dribbles from their own eyes-and-ears they were willing to share
with the Amyrlin, but Elaida was convinced the woman kept back some
of even that trickle. Yet she could not ask the Ajahs for
information directly. Bad enough to be weak without going begging
to the world. The Tower, anyway, which was as much of the world as
really counted.</p>

<p>Elaida kept her own face every bit as cool as the
other woman&rsquo;s, acknowledging her only with a nod while she
pretended to examine papers from the lacquered box. Slowly she
turned them over one by one, returned them to the box slowly.
Without really seeing a word. Making Alviarin wait was bitter,
because it was petty, and petty ways were all she had to strike at
one who should have been her servant.</p>

<p>An Amyrlin could issue any decree she wished, her
word law and absolute. Yet as a practical matter, without support
from the Hall of the Tower, many of those decrees were wasted ink
and paper. No sister would disobey an Amyrlin, not directly at
least, yet many decrees required a hundred other things ordered to
implement them. In the best of times that could come slowly, on
occasion so slowly it never happened, and these were far from the
best.</p>

<p>Alviarin stood there, calm as a frozen pond. Closing
the Altaran box, Elaida kept out the strip of paper that announced
her sure victory. Unconsciously she fingered it, a talisman. &ldquo;Has
Teslyn or Joline finally deigned to send more than word of their
safe arrival?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was meant to remind Alviarin that no one could
consider herself immune. Nobody cared what happened in Ebou Dar,
Elaida least of all; the capital of Altara could fall into the sea,
and except for the merchants, not even the rest of Altara would
notice. But Teslyn had sat in the Hall nearly fifteen years before
Elaida had commanded her to resign her chair. If Elaida could send
a Sitter&mdash;a <em>Red</em> Sitter&mdash;who had supported her
rise off as ambassador to a flyspeck throne with no one sure why
but a hundred rumors flowering, then she could come down on anyone.
Joline was a different matter. She had held her chair for the Green
only a matter of weeks, and everyone was sure the Greens had
selected her to show they would not be cowed by the new Amyrlin,
who had handed her a fearsome penance. That bit of insolence could
not be allowed to pass, of course, and had not been. Everyone knew
that, too.</p>

<p>It was meant to remind Alviarin that she was
vulnerable, but the slim woman merely smiled her cool smile. So
long as the Hall remained as it was, she <em>was</em> immune. She
riffled through the papers in her hand, plucking one out. &ldquo;No word
from Teslyn or Joline, Mother, no, though with the news you have
received so far from the thrones&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; That smile deepened into
something dangerously close to amusement. &ldquo;They all mean to try
their wings, to see if you are as strong as&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;as your
predecessor.&rdquo; Even Alviarin had enough sense not to speak the
Sanche woman&rsquo;s name in her presence. It was true, though;
every king and queen, even mere nobles, seemed to be testing the
limits of her power. She must make examples.</p>

<p>Glancing at the paper, Alviarin went on. &ldquo;There is
word from Ebou Dar, however. Through the Gray.&rdquo; Had she emphasized
that, to drive the splinter deeper? &ldquo;It appears Elayne Trakand and
Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara are there. Posing as full sisters, with the
blessings of the rebel&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>embassy</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to Queen Tylin.
There are two others, not identified, who may be doing the same.
The lists of who is with the rebels are incomplete. Or they may
just be companions. The Grays are uncertain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why under the Light would they be in Ebou Dar?&rdquo;
Elaida said dismissively. Certainly Teslyn would have sent news of
<em>that</em>. &ldquo;The Gray must be passing along rumors, now.
Tarna&rsquo;s message said they are with the rebels in Salidar.&rdquo;
Tarna Feir had reported Siuan Sanche there, too. And Logain Ablar,
spreading those vicious lies no Red sister could lower herself to
acknowledge, much less deny. The Sanche woman had a hand in that
obscenity, or the sun would rise in the west tomorrow. Why could
she not simply have crawled away and died, decently out of sight,
like other stilled women?</p>

<p>It required effort not to draw a deep breath. Logain
could be hanged quietly as soon as the rebels were dealt with; most
of the world thought him dead long since. The filthy slander that
the Red Ajah had set him up as a false Dragon would die with him.
When the rebels were dealt with, the Sanche woman could be made to
hand over the keys to the Amyrlin&rsquo;s eyes-and-ears. And name
the traitors who had helped her escape, A foolish hope to wish that
Alviarin would be named among them. &ldquo;I can hardly see the
al&rsquo;Meara girl running to Ebou Dar claiming to be Aes Sedai,
much less Elayne, can you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did order Elayne found, Mother. As important as
putting a leash on al&rsquo;Thor, you said. When she was among three
hundred rebels in Salidar, it was impossible to do anything, but
she will not be so well protected in the Tarasin Palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no time for gossip and rumors.&rdquo; Elaida bit
off each word with contempt. Did Alviarin know more than she
should, mentioning al&rsquo;Thor, and leashing? &ldquo;I suggest you read
Tarna&rsquo;s report again, then ask yourself whether even
<em>rebels</em> would allow Accepted to pretend to the shawl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alviarin waited with visible patience for her to
finish, then examined her sheaf again and pulled out four more
sheets. &ldquo;The Gray agent sent sketches,&rdquo; she said blandly,
proffering the pages. &ldquo;He is no artist, but Elayne and Nynaeve are
recognizable.&rdquo; After a moment, when Elaida did not take the
drawings, she slipped them under the rest.</p>

<p>Elaida felt the color of anger and embarrassment
rising in her cheeks. Alviarin had led her down this path
deliberately by not bringing out those sketches at the first. She
ignored that&mdash;anything else would only be more embarrassing
still&mdash;but her voice became cold. &ldquo;I want them taken, and
brought to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lack of curiosity on Alviarin&rsquo;s face made
Elaida wonder again how much the woman knew that she was not
supposed to. The al&rsquo;Meara girl might well provide a handle on
al&rsquo;Thor, coming from the same village. All the sisters knew
that, just as they knew that Elayne was Daughter-Heir of Andor, and
that her mother was dead. Vague rumors linking Morgase to the
Whitecloaks were so much nonsense, for she would never have gone to
the Children of the Light for help. She was dead, leaving not even
a corpse behind, and Elayne would be Queen. If she could be wrested
away from the rebels before the Andoran Houses put Dyelin on the
Lion Throne instead. It was not widely known what made Elayne more
important than any other noble with a strong claim to a throne.
Aside from the fact that she would be Aes Sedai one day, of
course.</p>

<p>Elaida had the Foretelling sometimes, a Talent many
thought lost before her, and long ago she had Foretold that the
Royal House of Andor held the key to winning the Last Battle.
Twenty-five years gone and more, as soon as it became clear that
Morgase Trakand would gain the throne in the Succession, Elaida had
fastened herself to the girl, as she was then. How Elayne was
crucial, Elaida did not know, but Foretelling never lied. Sometimes
she almost hated the Talent. She hated things she could not
control.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want all four of them, Alviarin.&rdquo; The other two
were unimportant, certainly, but she would take no chances. &ldquo;Send
my command to Teslyn immediately. Tell her&mdash;<em>and</em>
Joline&mdash;that if they fail to send regular reports from now
on, they will wish they had never been born. Include the
information from the Macura woman.&rdquo; Her mouth twisted around that
last.</p>

<p>The name made Alviarin shift uneasily, too, and no
wonder. Ronde Macura&rsquo;s nasty little infusion was something to
make any sister uncomfortable. Forkroot was not lethal&mdash;at
least you woke, if you drank enough to sleep&mdash;but a tea that
deadened a woman&rsquo;s ability to channel seemed aimed too
directly at Aes Sedai. A pity the information had not been received
before Galina went; if forkroot worked on men as well as it seemed
to on women, it would have made her task considerably easier.</p>

<p>Alviarin&rsquo;s ill ease lasted only a moment; a mere
instant and she was all self-possession again, unyielding as a wall
of ice. &ldquo;As you wish, Mother. I am sure they will leap to obey, as
of course they should.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A sudden flash of irritation swept Elaida like fire
in dry pasture. The fate of the world in her hands, and petty
stumbling blocks kept rising beneath her feet. Bad enough that she
had rebels and recalcitrant rulers to handle, but too many Sitters
still brooded and grumbled behind her back, fertile ground for the
other woman to plow. Only six were firmly under her own thumb, and
she suspected as many at least listened closely to Alviarin before
they voted. Certainly nothing of importance passed through the Hall
unless Alviarin agreed to it. Not open agreement, not with any
acknowledgment that Alviarin bore a shred more influence or power
than a Keeper should, but if Alviarin opposed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;At least they
had not gone so far as to reject anything Elaida sent them. They
simply dragged their feet and too often let what she wanted starve
on the floor. A pitifully small thing for which to be happy. Some
Amyrlins had become little more than puppets once the Hall acquired
a taste for rejecting what they put forward.</p>

<p>Her hands clenched, and a tiny crackle came from the
strip of paper.</p>

<p class="note">The ring has been placed in the bull&rsquo;s nose.</p>

<p>Alviarin looked as composed as a marble statue, but
Elaida no longer cared. The shepherd was on his way to her. The
rebels would be crushed and the Hall cowed, Alviarin forced to her
knees and every fractious ruler brought to heel, from Tenobia of
Saldaea, who had gone into hiding to avoid her emissary, to Mattin
Stepaneos of Illian, who was trying to play all sides at once
again, trying to agree with her <em>and</em> the Whitecloaks, and
with al&rsquo;Thor for all she knew. Elayne would be placed on the
throne in Caemlyn, without her brother to get in the way and with a
full knowledge of who had set her there. A little time back in the
Tower would make the girl damp clay in Elaida&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want <em>those men</em> rooted out, Alviarin.&rdquo;
There was no need to say who she meant; half the Tower could talk
of nothing but <em>those men</em> in their <em>Black</em> Tower,
and the other half whispered about them in corners.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are disturbing reports, Mother.&rdquo; Alviarin
looked through her papers once more, but Elaida thought it was only
for something to do. She did not pluck out any more pages, and if
nothing else disturbed the woman for long, this unholy midden
outside Caemlyn must.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>More</em> rumors? Do you believe the tales of
thousands flocking to Caemlyn in answer to that obscene
<em>amnesty</em>?&rdquo; Not the least of what al&rsquo;Thor had done, but
hardly cause for worry. Just a pile of filth that must be safely
cleared before Elayne was crowned in Caemlyn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not, Mother, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Toveine is to lead; this task belongs properly to
the Red.&rdquo; Toveine Gazal had been fifteen years away from the Tower,
until Elaida summoned her back. The other two Red Sitters who had
resigned and gone into a &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; retreat at the same time were
nervous-eyed women now, but unlike Lirene and Tsutama, Toveine had
only hardened in her solitary exile. &ldquo;She is to have fifty
sisters.&rdquo; There could not be more than two or three men at this
<em>Black</em> Tower actually able to channel, Elaida was certain.
Fifty sisters could overwhelm them easily. Yet there might be
others to deal with. Hangers-on, camp followers, fools full of
futile hopes and insane ambitions. &ldquo;And she is to take a hundred&mdash;no, two hundred&mdash;of the Guard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you certain that is wise? The rumors of
thousands are certainly madness, but a Green agent in Caemlyn
claims there are over four hundred in this Black Tower, A clever
fellow. It seems he counted the supply carts that go out from the
city. And you are aware of the rumors Mazrim Taim is with
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elaida fought to keep her features smooth, and barely
succeeded. She had forbidden mention of Taim&rsquo;s name, and it
was bitter that she did not dare&mdash;did not dare!&mdash;impose
the penalty on Alviarin. The woman looked her straight in the eyes;
the absence of so much as a perfunctory &ldquo;Mother&rdquo; this time was
marked. And the <em>temerity</em> of asking whether her actions
were wise! She was the Amyrlin Seat! Not first among equals; the
Amyrlin Seat!</p>

<p>Opening the largest of the lacquered boxes revealed
carved ivory miniatures laid out on gray velvet. Often just
handling her collection soothed her, but more, like the knitting
she enjoyed, it let whoever was attending her know their place, if
she seemed to give more attention to the miniatures than to what
they had to say. Fingering first an exquisite cat, sleek and
flowing, then an elaborately robed woman with a peculiar little
animal, some fantasy of the carver, almost like a man covered in
hair, crouched on her shoulder, at length Elaida chose out a
curving fish, so delicately carved that it seemed nearly real
despite the aged yellow of the ivory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four hundred rabble, Alviarin.&rdquo; She felt calmer
already, for Alviarin&rsquo;s mouth had thinned. Just a fraction,
but she savored any crack in the woman&rsquo;s fa&ccedil;ade. &ldquo;If
there are that many. Only a fool could believe that more than one
or two can channel. At most! In ten years, we have found only six
men with the ability. Just twenty-four in the last twenty years.
And you know how the land has been scoured. As for Taim&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; The
name burned her mouth; the only false Dragon ever to escape being
gentled once in the hands of Aes Sedai. Not a thing she wanted in
the Chronicles under her reign, certainly not until she decided how
it should be recorded. At present the Chronicles told nothing after
his capture.</p>

<p>She stroked her thumb along the fish&rsquo;s scales. &ldquo;He is dead, Alviarin, else we would have heard from him long
since. And not serving al&rsquo;Thor. Can you think he went from
claiming to be the Dragon Reborn to <em>serving</em> the Dragon
Reborn? Can you think he could be in Caemlyn without Davram Bashere
at least trying to kill him?&rdquo; Her thumb moved faster on the ivory
fish as she reminded herself that the Marshal-General of Saldaea
was in Caemlyn taking orders from al&rsquo;Thor. What <em>was</em>
Tenobia playing at? Elaida held it all inside, though, presenting a
face as calm as one of her carvings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twenty-four is a dangerous number to speak aloud,&rdquo;
Alviarin said with an ominous quiet, &ldquo;as dangerous as two thousand.
The Chronicles record only sixteen. The last thing needed now is
for those years to rear up again. Or for sisters who know only what
they were told to learn the truth. Even those you brought back hold
their silence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elaida put on a bemused look. So far as she knew,
Alviarin had learned the truth of those years only on being raised
Keeper, but her own knowledge was more personal. Not that Alviarin
could be aware of that. Not for certain, anyway. &ldquo;Daughter,
whatever comes out, I have no fear. Who is going to impose a
penance on <em>me</em>, and on what charge?&rdquo; That skirted truth
nicely, but apparently it impressed the other woman not at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Chronicles record a number of Amyrlins who took
on public penance for some usually obscure reason, but it has
always seemed to me that is how an Amyrlin might have it written if
she found herself with no choice except&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elaida&rsquo;s hand slapped down on the table. &ldquo;Enough, daughter! I <em>am</em> Tower law! What has been hidden
will remain hidden, for the same reason it has for twenty years&mdash;the good of the White Tower.&rdquo; Only then did she feel the
bruise beginning on her palm; she lifted her hand to reveal the
fish, broken in two. How old had it been? Five hundred years? A
thousand? It was all she could do not to quiver with rage. Her
voice certainly thickened with it. &ldquo;Toveine is to lead fifty
sisters and two hundred of the Tower Guards to Caemlyn, to this
Black Tower, where they will gentle any man they find able to
channel and hang him, along with as many others as they can take
alive.&rdquo; Alviarin did not even blink at the violation of Tower law.
Elaida had spoken the truth as she meant it to be; with this, with
everything, she <em>was</em> Tower law. &ldquo;For that matter, hang up
the dead as well. Let them be a warning to any man who thinks of
touching the True Source. Have Toveine attend me. I will want to
hear her plan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be as you command, Mother.&rdquo; The woman&rsquo;s
reply was as cool and smooth as her face. &ldquo;Though if I may suggest,
you might wish to reconsider sending so many sisters away from the
Tower. Apparently the rebels found your offer wanting. They are no
longer in Salidar. They are on the march. The reports come from
Altara, but they must be into Murandy by now. And they have chosen
themselves an Amyrlin.&rdquo; She scanned the top sheet of her sheaf of
papers as if searching for the name. &ldquo;Egwene al&rsquo;Vere, it
seems.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That Alviarin had left this, the most important piece
of news, until now, should have made Elaida explode in fury.
Instead, she threw back her head and laughed. Only a firm hold on
dignity kept her from drumming her heels on the floor. The surprise
on Alviarin&rsquo;s face made her laugh harder, till she had to wipe
her eyes with her fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not see it,&rdquo; she said when she could speak
between ripples of mirth. &ldquo;As well you are Keeper, Alviarin, not a
Sitter. In the Hall, blind as you are, within a month the others
would be holding you in a cabinet and taking you out when they
needed your vote.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see enough, Mother.&rdquo; Alviarin&rsquo;s voice held no
heat; if anything, it should have coated the walls with frost. &ldquo;I
see three hundred rebel Aes Sedai, perhaps more, marching on Tar
Valon with an army led by Gareth Bryne, acknowledged a great
captain. Discounting the more ridiculous reports, that army may
number over twenty thousand, and with Bryne to lead they will gain
more at every village and town they pass. I do not say they have
hope of taking the city, of course, but it is hardly a matter for
laughter. High Captain Chubain should be ordered to increase
recruiting for the Tower Guard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elaida&rsquo;s gaze fell sourly on the broken fish,
and she stood and stalked to the nearest window, her back to
Alviarin. The palace under construction took away the bitter taste,
that and the slip of paper she still clutched.</p>

<p>She smiled down on her palace-to-be. &ldquo;Three hundred
rebels, yes, but you should read Tarna&rsquo;s account again. At
least a hundred are on the point of breaking already.&rdquo; She trusted
Tarna to some extent, a Red with no room in her head for nonsense,
and she said the rebels were ready to jump at shadows. Quietly
desperate sheep looking for a shepherd, she said. A wilder, of
course, yet still sensible. Tarna should be back soon, and able to
give a fuller report. Not that it was needed. Elaida&rsquo;s plans
were already working among the rebels. But that was her secret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tarna has always been sure she could make people do
what it was clear they would not.&rdquo; Had there been an emphasis in
that, a significance of tone? Elaida decided to ignore it. She had
to ignore too much from Alviarin, but the day would come. Soon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for their army, daughter, she says two or three
thousand men at most. If they had more, they would have made sure
she saw them, to overawe us.&rdquo; In Elaida&rsquo;s opinion,
eyes-and-ears always exaggerated, to make their information seem
more valuable. Only sisters could be truly trusted. Red sisters,
anyway. Some of them. &ldquo;But I would not care if they did have twenty
thousand, or fifty, or a hundred. Can you even begin to guess why?&rdquo;
When she turned, Alviarin&rsquo;s face was all smooth composure, a
mask over blind ignorance. &ldquo;You seem to be conversant with all the
aspects of Tower law. What penalty do rebels face?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the leaders,&rdquo; Alviarin said slowly, &ldquo;stilling.&rdquo;
She frowned slightly, skirts swaying just barely as her feet
shifted. Good. Even Accepted knew this, and she could not
understand why Elaida asked. Very good. &ldquo;For many of the rest,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo; The leaders might themselves escape that,
most of them, if they submitted properly. The minimum penalty in
law was to be birched in the Grand Hall before the assembled
sisters, followed by at least a year and a day in public penance.
Yet nothing said the penance must be served all at once; a month
here, a month there, and they would still be atoning their crimes
ten years from now, constant reminders of what came of resisting
her. Some would be stilled, of course&mdash;Sheriam, a few of the
more prominent so-called Sitters&mdash;but only sufficient to make
the rest fear putting a foot wrong again; not enough to weaken the
Tower. The White Tower had to be whole, and it had to be strong.
Strong, and firmly in her grasp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only one crime among those they have committed
<em>demands</em> stilling.&rdquo; Alviarin opened her mouth. There had
been ancient rebellions, buried so deep that few among the sisters
knew; the Chronicles stood mute, the lists of stilled and executed
confined to records open only to Amyrlin, Keeper and Sitters, aside
from the few librarians who kept them. Elaida allowed Alviarin no
opportunity to speak. &ldquo;Any woman who falsely claims the title of
Amyrlin Seat <em>must</em> be stilled. If they believed they had
any chance of success, Sheriam would be their <em>Amyrlin</em>, or
Lelaine, or Carlinya, or one of the others.&rdquo; Tarna reported that
Romanda Cassin had come out of her retirement; Romanda surely would
have seized the stole with both hands if she saw the tenth part of
a chance. &ldquo;Instead, they have plucked out an
<em>Accepted</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elaida shook her head in wry amusement. She could
quote every word of the law setting out how a woman was chosen
Amyrlin&mdash;she had made good use of it herself, after all&mdash;and never once did it require that the woman be a full
sister. Obviously she <em>must</em> be, so those who framed the law
never stated it, and the rebels had squirmed through that crack. &ldquo;They know their cause is hopeless, Alviarin. They plan to strut
and bluster, try to dig out some protection against penalty for
themselves, then yield the girl as a sacrifice.&rdquo; Which was a pity.
The al&rsquo;Vere girl was another possible handle on al&rsquo;Thor,
and when she reached her full strength in the One Power, she would
have been one of the strongest in a thousand years or more. A true
pity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gareth Bryne and an army hardly sound like strutting
to me. It will take their army five or six months to reach Tar
Valon. In that time, High Captain Chubain could increase the Guard&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Their <em>army</em>,&rdquo; Elaida sneered. Alviarin was
such a fool; for all her cool exterior, she was a rabbit. Next she
would be spouting the Sanche woman&rsquo;s nonsense about the
Forsaken being loose. Of course, she did not know the secret, but
just the same&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;Farmers carrying pikes, butchers with bows and
tailors on horseback! And every step of the way, thinking of the
Shining Walls, that held Artur Hawkwing at bay.&rdquo; No, not a rabbit.
A weasel. Yet soon or late, she would be weasel-fur trim on
Elaida&rsquo;s cloak. The Light send it soon. &ldquo;Every step of the
way, they will lose a man, if not ten. I would not be surprised if
our rebels appear with nothing more than their Warders.&rdquo; Too many
people knew of the division in the Tower. Once the rebellion was
broken, of course, it could be made to seem all a ploy, a part of
gaining control of young al&rsquo;Thor perhaps. An effort of years,
that, and generations before memories faded. Every last rebel would
pay for that on her knees.</p>

<p>Elaida clenched her fist as though she held all the
rebels by the throat. Or Alviarin. &ldquo;I mean to break them, daughter.
They will split open like a rotten melon.&rdquo; Her secret assured that,
however many farmers and tailors Lord Bryne hung on to, but let the
other woman think as she would. Suddenly the Foretelling took hold
of her, a certainty about things she could not see stronger than if
they had been laid out before her. She would have been willing to
step blindly over a cliff on that certainty. &ldquo;The White Tower will
be whole again, except for remnants cast out and scorned, whole and
stronger than ever. Rand al&rsquo;Thor will face the Amyrlin Seat
and know her anger. The Black Tower will be rent in blood and fire,
and sisters will walk its grounds. This I Foretell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As usual, the Foretelling left her trembling, gasping
for breath. She forced herself to stand still and straight, to
breathe slowly; she never let anyone see weakness. But Alviarin&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Her eyes were wide as they could open, lips parted as if she had
forgotten the words she meant to speak. A paper slid from the sheaf
in her hands and almost fell before she could catch it. That
recalled her to herself. In a flash she regained her serene mask, a
perfect picture of Aes Sedai calm, but she definitely had been
jolted to her heels. Oh, very good. Let her chew on the certain
surety of Elaida&rsquo;s victory. Chew and break her teeth.</p>

<p>Elaida drew a deep breath and seated herself behind
her writing table again, putting the broken ivory fish to one side
where she did not have to look at it. It was time to exploit her
victory. &ldquo;There is work to be done today, daughter. The first
message is to go to the Lady Caraline Damodred&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elaida spun out her plans, enlarging on what Alviarin
knew, revealing some that she did not, because at the last an
Amyrlin did have to work through her Keeper, however much she hated
the woman. There was a pleasure in watching Alviarin&rsquo;s eyes,
watching her wonder what else she still did not know. But while
Elaida ordered, divided and assigned the world between the Aryth
Ocean and the Spine of the World, in her mind frolicked the image
of young al&rsquo;Thor on his way to her like a caged bear, to be
taught to dance for his dinner.</p>

<p>The Chronicles could hardly record the years of the
Last Battle without mentioning the Dragon Reborn, but she knew that
one name would be written larger than all others. Elaida do Avriny
a&rsquo;Roihan, youngest daughter of a minor House in the north of
Murandy, would go down in history as the greatest and most powerful
Amyrlin Seat of all time. The most powerful woman in the history of
the world. The woman who saved humankind.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The Aiel standing in a deep fold in the low,
brown-grass hills seemed carved figures, ignoring sheets of dust
sweeping ahead of a gusting wind. That snow should have been deep
on the ground this time of year did not bother them; none had ever
seen snow, and this oven heat, with the sun still well short of its
peak, was less than where they came from. Their attention remained
fixed on the southern rise, waiting for the signal that would
announce the arrival of the destiny of the Shaido Aiel.</p>

<p>Outwardly, Sevanna looked like the others, though a
ring of Maidens marked her out, resting easily on their heels, dark
veils already hiding their faces to the eyes. She also waited, and
more impatiently than she let on, but not to the exclusion of
everything else. That was one reason why she commanded and the rest
followed. The second was that she saw what could be if you refused
to let outworn custom and stale tradition tie your hands.</p>

<p>A slight flicker of her green eyes to the left showed
twelve men and one woman, each with round bull-hide buckler and
three or four short spears, garbed in gray-and-brown
<em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em> that blended as well with the terrain here
as in the Three-fold Land. Efalin, short graying hair hidden by the
<em>shoufa</em> wrapped around her head, sometimes glanced
Sevanna&rsquo;s way; if a Maiden of the Spear could be said to be
uneasy, Efalin was. Some Shaido Maidens had gone south, joining the
fools capering around Rand al&rsquo;Thor, and Sevanna did not doubt
others talked of it. Efalin must be wondering whether providing
Sevanna with an escort of Maidens, as if she had been <em>Far
Dareis Mai</em> once herself, was enough to balance that. At least
Efalin had no doubts where true power lay.</p>

<p>Like Efalin, the men led Shaido warrior societies,
and they eyed one another between watching the rise. Especially
blocky Maeric, who was <em>Seia Doon</em>, and scar-faced Bendhuin,
of <em>Far Aldazar Din</em>. After today, no longer would anything
hold back the Shaido from sending a man to Rhuidean, to be marked
as the clan chief if he survived. Until that happened, Sevanna
spoke as the clan chief since she was the widow of the last chief.
Of the last two chiefs. And let those who muttered that she carried
bad luck choke on it.</p>

<p>Gold and ivory bracelets clattered softly as she
straightened the dark shawl over her arms and adjusted her
necklaces. Most of those were gold and ivory too, but one was a
mass of pearls and rubies that had belonged to a wetlander
noblewoman&mdash;the woman now wore white and hauled and fetched
alongside the other <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> back in the mountains
called Kinslayer&rsquo;s Dagger&mdash;with a ruby the size of a
small hen&rsquo;s egg nestled between her breasts. The wetlands held
rich prizes. A large emerald on her finger caught sunlight in green
fire; finger rings were one wetlander custom worth adopting, no
matter the stares often aimed at hers. She would have more, if they
matched this one for magnificence.</p>

<p>Most of the men thought Maeric or Bendhuin would be
first to receive the Wise Ones&rsquo; permission to try Rhuidean.
Only Efalin in that group suspected that none would, and she only
suspected; she also was astute enough to voice her suspicions
circumspectly to Sevanna and not at all to anyone else. Their minds
could not encompass the possibility of shedding the old, and in
truth, if Sevanna was impatient to don the new, she was also aware
that she must bring them to it slowly. Much had changed already in
the old ways since the Shaido crossed the Dragonwall into the
wetlands&mdash;still wet, compared to the Three-fold Land&mdash;yet more would change. Once Rand al&rsquo;Thor was in her hands,
once she had wed the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>, the chief of
chiefs of all the Aiel&mdash;this nonsense of the Dragon Reborn
was wetlander foolishness&mdash;there would be a new way of naming
clan chiefs, and sept chiefs as well. Perhaps even the heads of the
warrior societies. Rand al&rsquo;Thor would name them. Pointing
where she told him, of course. And that would be only the
beginning. The wetlander notion of handing down rank to your
children, and their children, for instance.</p>

<p>The wind swept higher for a moment, blowing south. It
would cover the sound of the wetlanders&rsquo; horses and
wagons.</p>

<p>She shifted her shawl again, then suppressed a
grimace. At all costs she must not appear nervous. A glance to the
right stilled worry as soon as begun. Over two hundred Shaido Wise
Ones clustered there, and normally at least some would be watching
her like vultures, but their eyes were all on the rise. More than
one adjusted her shawl uneasily or smoothed bulky skirts.
Sevanna&rsquo;s lip curled. Sweat beaded on some of those faces.
Sweat! Where was their honor that they showed nerves before every
gaze?</p>

<p>Everyone stiffened slightly as a young <em>Sovin
Nai</em> appeared above them, lowering his veil as he scrambled
down. He came straight to her, as was proper, but to her irritation
he raised his voice enough for all to hear. &ldquo;One of their forward
scouts escaped. He was wounded, but still on his horse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The society leaders began to move before he finished
speaking. That would never do. They would lead in the actual
fighting&mdash;Sevanna had never more than held a spear in her
life&mdash;but she would not let them forget for a moment who she
was. &ldquo;Throw every last spear against them,&rdquo; she ordered loudly, &ldquo;before they can ready themselves.&rdquo; They rounded on her as one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every spear?&rdquo; Bendhuin demanded incredulously. &ldquo;You
mean except for the screens&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Glowering, Maeric spoke right on top of him. &ldquo;If we
keep no reserve, we can be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sevanna cut them both off. &ldquo;Every spear! These are
Aes Sedai we dance with. We must overwhelm them immediately!&rdquo;
Efalin and most of the others schooled their faces to stillness,
but Bendhuin and Maeric frowned, ready to argue. Fools. They faced
a few dozen Aes Sedai, a few hundred wetlander soldiers, yet with
the more than forty thousand <em>algai&rsquo;d&rsquo;siswai</em> they
had insisted on, they still wanted their screens of scouts and
their spears in reserve as if they faced other Aiel or a wetlander
army. &ldquo;I speak as the clan chief of the Shaido.&rdquo; She should not
have to say that, but a reminder could do no harm. &ldquo;They are a
handful.&rdquo; She weighted every word with contempt now. &ldquo;They can be
run down if the spears move quickly. You were ready to avenge
Desaine this sunrise. Do I smell fear now? Fear of a few
wetlanders? Has honor gone from the Shaido?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That turned their faces to stone, as intended. Even
Efalin showed eyes like polished gray gems as she veiled; her
fingers moved in Maiden handtalk, and as the society leaders
sprinted up the rise, the Maidens around Sevanna followed.
<em>That</em> was not what she had intended, but at least the
spears were moving. Even from the bottom of the fold she could see
what had seemed bare ground disgorging <em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em>-clad
figures, all hurrying south with the long strides that could run
down horses. There was no time to waste. With a thought to have
words with Efalin later, Sevanna turned to the Wise Ones.</p>

<p>Chosen from the strongest of the Shaido Wise Ones who
could wield the One Power, they were six or seven for every Aes
Sedai around Rand al&rsquo;Thor, yet Sevanna saw doubt. They tried
to hide it behind stony faces, but it was there, in shifting eyes,
in tongues wetting lips. Many traditions fell today, traditions old
and strong as law. Wise Ones did not take part in battles. Wise
Ones kept far from Aes Sedai. They knew the ancient tales, that the
Aiel had been sent to the Three-fold Land for failing the Aes
Sedai, that they would be destroyed if ever they failed them again.
They had heard the stories, what Rand al&rsquo;Thor had claimed
before all, that as part of their service to the Aes Sedai, the
Aiel had sworn to do no violence.</p>

<p>Once Sevanna had been sure those stories were lies,
but of late she believed the Wise Ones knew them for truth. None
had told her so, of course. It did not matter. She herself had
never made the two journeys to Rhuidean required to become a Wise
One, but the others had accepted her, however reluctant some had
been. Now they had no choice but to go on accepting. Useless
traditions would be carved into new.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aes Sedai,&rdquo; she said softly. They leaned toward her
in a muted clatter of bracelets and necklaces, to catch her low
words. &ldquo;They hold Rand al&rsquo;Thor, the
<em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>. We must take him from them.&rdquo; There
were scattered frowns. Most believed she wanted the
<em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> taken alive in order to avenge the
death of Couladin, her second husband. They understood that, but
they would not have come here for it. &ldquo;Aes Sedai,&rdquo; she hissed
angrily. &ldquo;We kept our pledge, but they broke theirs. We violated
nothing, but they have violated everything. You know how Desaine
was murdered.&rdquo; And of course they did. The eyes watching her were
suddenly sharper. Killing a Wise One ranked with killing a pregnant
woman, a child or a blacksmith. Some of those eyes were
<em>very</em> sharp. Therava&rsquo;s, Rhiale&rsquo;s, others&rsquo;. &ldquo;If we allow these women to walk away from that, then <em>we</em>
are less than animals, <em>we</em> will have no honor. <em>I</em>
hold my honor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On that she gathered her skirts with dignity and
climbed the slope, head high, not looking back. She was certain the
others would follow. Therava and Norlea and Dailin would see to
that, and Rhiale and Tion and Meira and the rest who had
accompanied her a few days past to see Rand al&rsquo;Thor beaten
and put back into his wooden chest by the Aes Sedai. Her reminder
had been for those thirteen even more than the others, and they
dared not fail her. The truth of how Desaine had died tied them to
her.</p>

<p>Wise Ones with their skirts looped over their arms to
free their legs could not keep up with the
<em>algai&rsquo;d&rsquo;siswai</em> in <em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em>
however hard they ran, though race they did. Five miles across
those low rolling hills, not a long run, and they topped a crest to
see the dance of spears already begun. After a fashion.</p>

<p>Thousands of <em>algai&rsquo;d&rsquo;siswai</em> made a
huge pool of veiled gray-and-brown surging around a circle of
wetlander wagons, which itself surrounded one of the small clumps
of trees that dotted this region. Sevanna drew an angry breath. The
Aes Sedai had even had time to bring all of their horses inside.
The spears encircled the wagons, pressed in on them, showered
arrows toward them, but those at the front seemed to push against
an invisible wall. At first the arrows that arched highest passed
over this wall, but then they too began striking something unseen
and bouncing back. A low murmur rose among the Wise Ones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see what the Aes Sedai do?&rdquo; Sevanna demanded, as
though she also could see the One Power being woven. She wanted to
sneer; the Aes Sedai were fools, with their vaunted Three Oaths.
When they finally decided they must use the Power as a weapon
instead of just to make barriers, it would be too late. Provided
the Wise Ones did not stand too long staring. Somewhere in those
wagons was Rand al&rsquo;Thor, perhaps still doubled into a chest
like a bolt of silk. Waiting for her to pick him up. If the Aes
Sedai could hold him, then she could, with the Wise Ones. And a
promise. &ldquo;Therava, take your half to the west now. Be ready to
strike when I do. For Desaine, and the <em>toh</em> the Aes Sedai
owe us. We will make them meet <em>toh</em> as no one ever has
before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a foolish boast to speak of making someone
meet an obligation they had not acknowledged, yet in the angry
mutters from the other women, Sevanna heard other furious promises
to make the Aes Sedai meet <em>toh</em>. Only those who had killed
Desaine on Sevanna&rsquo;s orders stood silent. Therava&rsquo;s
narrow lips tightened slightly, but finally she said, &ldquo;It will be
as you say, Sevanna.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At an easy lope, Sevanna led her half of the Wise
Ones to the east side of the battle, if it could be called that
yet. She had wanted to remain on a rise where she could have a good
view&mdash;that was how a clan chief or battle leader directed the
dance of spears&mdash;but in this one thing she found no support
even from Therava and the others who shared the secret of
Desaine&rsquo;s death. The Wise Ones made a sharp contrast with the
<em>algai&rsquo;d&rsquo;siswai</em> as she lined them up in their
white <em>algode</em> blouses and dark wool skirts and shawls,
their glittering bracelets and necklaces and their waist-length
hair held back by dark folded scarves. For all their decision that
if they were to be in the dance of the spears, they would be in it,
not on a rise apart, she did not believe they yet realized that the
true battle today was theirs to fight. After today, nothing would
be the same again, and tethering Rand al&rsquo;Thor was the smallest
part.</p>

<p>Among the <em>algai&rsquo;d&rsquo;siswai</em> staring
toward the wagons only height quickly told men from Maidens. Veils
and <em>shoufa</em> hid heads and faces, and
<em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em> was <em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em> aside from the
differences of cut that marked clan and sept and society. Those at
the outer edge of the encirclement appeared confused, grumbling
among themselves as they waited for something to happen. They had
come prepared to dance with Aes Sedai lightning, and now they
milled impatiently, too far back even to use the horn bows still in
leather cases on their backs. They would not have to wait much
longer if Sevanna had her way.</p>

<p>Hands on hips, she addressed the other Wise Ones. &ldquo;Those to the south of me will disrupt what the Aes Sedai are
doing. Those to the north will attack. Forward the spears!&rdquo; With
the command, she turned to watch the destruction of the Aes Sedai
who thought they had only steel to face.</p>

<p>Nothing happened. In front of her the mass of
<em>algai&rsquo;d&rsquo;siswai</em> seethed uselessly, and the
loudest sound was the occasional drumming of spears on bucklers.
Sevanna gathered her anger, winding it like thread from the
spinning. She had been so sure they were ready after Desaine&rsquo;s
butchered corpse was displayed to them, but if they still found
attacking Aes Sedai unthinkable, she would chivvy them to it if she
had to shame them all till they demanded to put on
<em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> white.</p>

<p>Suddenly a ball of pure flame the size of a
man&rsquo;s head arched toward the wagons, sizzling and hissing,
then another, dozens. The knot in her middle loosened. More
fireballs came from the west, from Therava and the rest. Smoke
began to rise from burning wagons, first gray wisps, then
thickening black pillars; the murmurs of the
<em>algai&rsquo;d&rsquo;siswai</em> changed pitch, and if those
directly in front of her moved little, there was a sudden sense of
pressing forward. Shouts drifted from the wagons, men yelling in
anger, bellowing in pain. Whatever barriers the Aes Sedai had made
were down. It had begun, and there could be only one ending. Rand
al&rsquo;Thor would be hers; he would give her the Aiel, to take all
of the wetlands, and before he died he would give her daughters and
sons to lead the Aiel after her. She might enjoy that; he was quite
pretty, really, strong and young.</p>

<p>She did not expect the Aes Sedai to go down easily,
and they did not. Fireballs fell among the spears, turning
<em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em>-clad figures to torches, and lightnings
struck from a clear sky, hurling men and earth into the air. The
Wise Ones learned from what they saw, though, or perhaps they
already knew and had hesitated before; most channeled so seldom,
especially where anyone besides Wise Ones could see, that only
another Wise One knew whether any given woman could. Whatever the
reason, no sooner did lightning begin to fall among the Shaido
spears than more struck toward the wagons.</p>

<p>Not all reached its target. Balls of fire streaking
through the air, some large as horses now, silver lightning
stabbing toward the ground like spears from the heavens, sometimes
suddenly darted aside as if striking an invisible shield, or
erupted violently in midair, or simply vanished altogether. Roars
and crashes filled the air, warring with shouts and screams.
Sevanna stared at the sky in delight. It was like the
Illuminators&rsquo; displays she had read about.</p>

<p>Suddenly the world turned white in her eyes; she
seemed to be floating. When she could see again, she was flat on
the ground a dozen paces from where she had stood, aching in every
muscle, struggling for breath and covered with a scattering of
dirt. Her hair wanted to lift away from her.</p>

<p>Other Wise Ones were down as well, around a ragged
hole a span across torn in the ground; thin tendrils of smoke rose
from the dresses of some. Not everyone had fallen&mdash;the battle
of fire and lightning continued in the sky&mdash;but too many. She
had to throw them back into the dance.</p>

<p>Forcing herself to breathe, she scrambled to her
feet, not bothering to brush off the dirt. &ldquo;Push spears!&rdquo; she
shouted. Seizing Estalaine&rsquo;s angular shoulders, she started to
drag the woman to her feet, then realized from her staring blue
eyes that she was dead and let her fall. She pulled a dazed
Dorailla erect instead, then seized up a spear from a fallen
Thunder Walker and waved it high. &ldquo;Forward the spears!&rdquo; Some of the
Wise Ones seemed to take her literally, plunging into the mass of
<em>algai&rsquo;d&rsquo;siswai</em>. Others kept their heads better,
helping those who could rise, and the storm of fire and lightning
continued as she raged up and down the line of Wise Ones, waving
her spear and shouting. &ldquo;Push spears! Forward the spears!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She felt like laughing; she did laugh. With dirt all
over her and the battle raging, she had never been so exhilarated
before in her life. Almost she wished she had chosen to become a
Maiden of the Spear. Almost. No <em>Far Dareis Mai</em> could ever
be clan chief, any more than a man could be a Wise One; a
Maiden&rsquo;s route to power was to give up the spear and become a
Wise One. As wife of a clan chief she had been wielding power at an
age when a Maiden was barely trusted to carry a spear or a Wise
One&rsquo;s apprentice to fetch water. And now she had it all, Wise
One and clan chief, though it would take some doing yet to have
that last title in truth. Titles mattered little so long as she had
the power, but why should she not have both?</p>

<p>A sudden scream made her turn, and she gaped at the
sight of a shaggy gray wolf ripping Dosera&rsquo;s throat out.
Without thought she plunged her spear into its side. Even as it
twisted to snap at the spear haft, another waist-tall wolf bounded
past her to hurl itself onto the back of one of the
<em>algai&rsquo;d&rsquo;siswai</em>, then another wolf, and more,
tearing into <em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em>-clad figures wherever she
looked.</p>

<p>Superstitious fear lanced through her as she pulled
her spear free. The Aes Sedai had called wolves to fight for them.
She could not take her gaze from the wolf she had killed. The Aes
Sedai had&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;No. No! It could change nothing. She would not let
it.</p>

<p>Finally she managed to pull her eyes away, but before
she could shout encouragement to the Wise Ones again, something
else stilled her tongue and made her stare. A knot of wetlander
horsemen in red helmets and breastplates, laying about them with
swords, thrusting with long lances, in the middle of the
<em>algai&rsquo;d&rsquo;siswai</em>. Where had <em>they</em> come
from?</p>

<p>She did not realize she had spoken aloud until Rhiale
answered her. &ldquo;I tried to tell you, Sevanna, but you would not
listen.&rdquo; The flame-haired woman eyed her bloody spear
distastefully; Wise Ones were not supposed to carry spears. She
ostentatiously laid the weapon in the crook of her elbow, the way
she had seen chiefs do, as Rhiale went on. &ldquo;Wetlanders have
attacked from the south. Wetlanders and <em>siswai&rsquo;aman</em>.&rdquo;
She imbued the word with all the scorn proper for those who would
name themselves Spears of the Dragon. &ldquo;Maidens as well. And&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;And there are Wise Ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fighting?&rdquo; Sevanna said incredulously before
realizing how it sounded. If she could toss out decayed custom,
surely those sun-blinded fools to the south who still called
themselves Aiel could as well. She had not expected it, though. No
doubt Sorilea had brought them; that old woman reminded Sevanna of
a landslide plunging down a mountain, carrying all before it. &ldquo;We
must attack them at once. They will not have Rand al&rsquo;Thor. Or
ruin our vengeance for Desaine,&rdquo; she added when Rhiale&rsquo;s eyes
widened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are Wise Ones,&rdquo; the other woman said in a flat
tone, and Sevanna understood bitterly. Joining the dance of spears
was bad enough, but Wise One attacking Wise One was more than even
Rhiale would countenance. She had agreed that Desaine must die&mdash;how else could the other Wise Ones, not to mention the
<em>algai&rsquo;d&rsquo;siswai</em>, be brought to attack Aes Sedai,
which they must do to put Rand al&rsquo;Thor in their hands, and
with him all the Aiel?&mdash;yet that was done in secret,
surrounded by like-minded women. This would be before everyone.
Fools and cowards, all of them!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then fight those enemies you can bring yourself to
fight, Rhiale.&rdquo; She bit off every word with as much scorn as she
could, but Rhiale merely nodded, adjusted her shawl with another
glance at the spear on Sevanna&rsquo;s arm and returned to her place
in the line.</p>

<p>Perhaps there was a way to make the other Wise Ones
move first. Better to attack by surprise, but better anything than
that they should snatch Rand al&rsquo;Thor from her very hands. What
she would not give for a woman who could channel and would do as
she was told without balking. What she would not give to be on a
rise, where she could see how the battle went.</p>

<p>Keeping her spear ready and a wary eye out for wolves&mdash;those she could see were either killing men and women in
<em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em> or were dead themselves&mdash;she returned
to shouting encouragement. To the south more fire and lightning
fell among the Shaido than before, but it made no difference that
she could tell. That battle, with its explosions of flame and earth
and people, continued unabated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Push spears!&rdquo; she shouted, waving hers. &ldquo;Push
spears!&rdquo; Among the churning <em>algai&rsquo;d&rsquo;siswai</em> she
could not make out any of the fools who had tied a bit of red cloth
around their temples and named themselves
<em>siswai&rsquo;aman</em>. Perhaps they were too few to alter the
course of events. The knots of wetlanders certainly seemed few and
far between. Even as she watched, one was swarmed under, men and
horses, by stabbing spears. &ldquo;Push spears! Push spears!&rdquo; Exultation
filled her voice. If the Aes Sedai called ten thousand wolves, if
Sorilea had brought a thousand Wise Ones and a hundred thousand
spears, the Shaido would still emerge victorious today. The Shaido,
and herself. Sevanna of the Jumai Shaido would be a name remembered
forever.</p>

<p>Suddenly a hollow boom sounded amid the roar of
battle. It seemed to come from the direction of the Aes Sedai
wagons, but nothing told her whether they had caused it, or the
Wise Ones. She disliked things she did not understand, yet she was
not about to ask Rhiale or the others and flaunt her ignorance. And
her lack of the ability all here had, save her. It counted for
nothing among themselves, but another thing she did not like was
for others to have power she did not.</p>

<p>A flicker of light among the
<em>algai&rsquo;d&rsquo;siswai</em>, a sense of something turning,
caught the corner of her eye, but when she turned to look, there
was nothing. Again the same thing happened, a flash of light seen
on the edge of vision, and again when she looked there was nothing
to see. Too many things she did not understand.</p>

<p>Shouting encouragement, she eyed the line of Shaido
Wise Ones. Some appeared bedraggled, head scarves gone and long
hair hanging loose, skirts and blouses covered with dirt or even
singed. At least a dozen lay stretched out in a row, groaning, and
seven more were still, shawls laid over their faces. It was those
on their feet that interested her. Rhiale, and Alarys with her rare
black hair all awry, Someryn, who had taken to wearing her blouse
unlaced to show even more generous cleavage than Sevanna herself,
and Meira, with her long face yet more grim than usual. Stout Tion,
and skinny Belinde, and Modarra, as tall as most men.</p>

<p>One of them should have told her if they did
something new. The secret of Desaine bound them to her; even for a
Wise One, revelation of that would lead to a lifetime of pain&mdash;and worse, shame&mdash;trying to meet <em>toh</em>, if the
one revealed was not simply driven naked into the wilderness to
live or die as she could, likely to be killed like a beast by any
who found her. Even so, Sevanna was sure they took as much delight
as the rest in concealing things from her, the things that Wise
Ones learned during their apprenticeships, and in the journeys to
Rhuidean. Something would have to be done about that, but later.
She would not display weakness by asking what they did now.</p>

<p>Turning back to the battle, she found the balance
changing, and in her favor it appeared. To the south fireballs and
lightning bolts plummeted as heavily as ever, but not in front of
her, and it seemed not to the west or north either. What struck
toward the wagons still failed to reach the ground more often than
not, yet there was a definite slackening of the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s
efforts. They had been forced onto the defensive. She <em>was</em>
winning!</p>

<p>Even as the thought flushed through her like pure
heat, the Aes Sedai went silent. Only to the south did fire and
lightning still fall among the <em>algai&rsquo;d&rsquo;siswai</em>.
She opened her mouth to shout victory, and another realization
silenced her. Fire and lightning stormed down toward the wagons,
stormed down and crashed against some unseen obstruction. Smoke
from burning wagons was beginning to outline the shape of a dome as
it streamed up and finally billowed from a hole in the top of the
invisible enclosure.</p>

<p>Sevanna whirled to confront the line of Wise Ones,
her face such that several flinched back from her, and maybe from
the spear in her hand. She knew she looked ready to use it; she was
ready. &ldquo;Why have you let them do this?&rdquo; she raged. &ldquo;Why? You were
to obstruct whatever they did, not allow them to make more
walls!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tion looked ready to empty her stomach, but she
planted her fists on broad hips and faced Sevanna directly. &ldquo;It was
not the Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not the Aes Sedai?&rdquo; Sevanna spat. &ldquo;Then who? The
other Wise Ones? I told you we must attack them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not women,&rdquo; Rhiale said, her voice faltering. &ldquo;It was not&mdash;&rdquo; Face pale, she swallowed.</p>

<p>Sevanna turned slowly to stare at the dome, only then
remembering to breathe again. Something had risen through the hole
where the smoke gushed out. One of the wetlander banners. The smoke
was not enough to obscure it completely. Crimson, with a disc half
white and half black, the colors divided by a sinuous line, just
like the piece of cloth the <em>siswai&rsquo;aman</em> wore. Rand
al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s banner. Could he possibly be strong enough to
have broken free, overwhelmed all the Aes Sedai and raised that? It
had to be.</p>

<p>The storm still battered at the dome, but Sevanna
heard murmurs behind her. The other women were thinking of retreat.
Not her. She had always known that the easiest path to power lay
through conquering men who already possessed it, and even as a
child she was sure she had been born with the weapons to conquer
them. Suladric, clan chief of the Shaido, fell to her at sixteen,
and when he died, she chose out those most likely to succeed.
Muradin and Couladin each believed he alone had captured her
interest, and when Muradin failed to return from Rhuidean, as so
many men did, one smile convinced Couladin that he had overwhelmed
her. But the power of a clan chief paled beside that of the
<em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>, and even that was nothing beside
what she saw before her. She shivered as if she had just seen the
most beautiful man imaginable in the sweat tent. When Rand
al&rsquo;Thor was hers, she would conquer the whole world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Press harder,&rdquo; she commanded. &ldquo;Harder! We will
humble these Aes Sedai for Desaine!&rdquo; And she would have Rand
al&rsquo;Thor.</p>

<p>Abruptly there was a roar from the front of the
battle, men shouting, screaming. She cursed that she could not see
what was happening. Again she shouted for the Wise Ones to press
harder, but if anything, it seemed the fall of flame and lightning
against the dome lessened. And then there was something she could
see.</p>

<p>Close to the wagons, <em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em>-clad
figures and earth erupted into the air with a thunderous crash, not
in one place, but in a long line. Again the ground exploded, and
again, again, each time a little farther from the encircled wagons.
Not a line, but a solid ring of exploding ground and men and
Maidens that she had no doubt ran all the way around the wagons.
Again and again and again, ever expanding, and suddenly
<em>algai&rsquo;d&rsquo;siswai</em> were pushing past her, buffeting
through the line of Wise Ones, running.</p>

<p>Sevanna beat at them with her spear, flailing at
heads and shoulders, not caring when the spearhead came away redder
than before. &ldquo;Stand and fight! Stand, for the honor of the Shaido!&rdquo;
They rushed by unheeding. &ldquo;Have you no honor! Stand and fight!&rdquo; She
stabbed a fleeing Maiden in the back, but the rest just trampled
over the fallen woman. Abruptly she realized that some of the Wise
Ones were gone, and others picking up the injured. Rhiale turned to
run, and Sevanna seized the taller woman&rsquo;s arm, threatening
her with the spear. She did not care that Rhiale could channel. &ldquo;We
must stand! We can still have him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other woman&rsquo;s face was a mask of fear. &ldquo;If
we stand, we die! Or else we end chained outside Rand
al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s tent! Stay and die if you wish, Sevanna. I am
no Stone Dog!&rdquo; Ripping her arm free, she sped eastward.</p>

<p>For a moment more, Sevanna stood there, letting the
men and Maidens push her this way and that as they streamed by in
panic. Then she tossed down the spear and felt her belt pouch,
where a small cube of intricately carved stone lay. Well that she
had hesitated over throwing that away. She had another cord for her
bow yet. Gathering her skirts to bare her legs, she joined in the
chaotic flight, but if all the rest fled in terror, she ran with
plans whirling through her head. She <em>would</em> have Rand
al&rsquo;Thor on his knees before her, and the Aes Sedai as
well.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Alviarin finally left Elaida&rsquo;s apartments, as
cool and collected as ever on the surface. Inside, she felt wrung
out like a damp cloth. She managed to keep her legs steady down the
long curving flights of stairs, marble even in the very heights.
Liveried servants bowed and curtsied as they scurried about their
tasks, seeing only the Keeper in all her Aes Sedai serenity. As she
went lower, sisters began to appear, many wearing their shawls,
fringed in the colors of their Ajahs, as if to emphasize by
formality that they <em>were</em> full sisters. They eyed her as
she passed, uneasy often as not. The only one to ignore her was
Danelle, a dreamy Brown sister. She had been part of bringing down
Siuan Sanche and raising Elaida, but lost in her own thoughts, a
solitary with no friends even in her own Ajah, she seemed unaware
that she had been shoved aside. Others were all too aware. Berisha,
a lean and hard-eyed Gray, and Kera, with the fair hair and blue
eyes that appeared occasionally among Tairens and all the arrogance
so common to Greens, went so far as to curtsy. Norine made as if
to, then did not; big-eyed and nearly as dreamy as Danelle at
times, and as friendless, she resented Alviarin; if the Keeper came
from the White, in her eyes it should have been Norine Dovarna.</p>

<p>The courtesy was not required toward the Keeper, not
from a sister, but no doubt they hoped she might intercede with
Elaida should that become necessary. The others merely wondered
what commands she carried, whether another sister was to be singled
out today for some failure in the Amyrlin&rsquo;s eyes. Not even
Reds went within five levels of the Amyrlin&rsquo;s new apartments
unless summoned, and more than one sister actually hid when Elaida
came below. The very air seemed heated, thick with a fear that had
nothing to do with rebels or men channeling.</p>

<p>Several sisters tried to speak, but Alviarin brushed
past, barely polite, hardly noticing worry bloom in their eyes when
she refused to pause. Elaida filled her mind as much as theirs. A
woman of many layers, Elaida. The first look at her showed a
beautiful woman filled with dignified reserve, the second a woman
of steel, stern as a bared blade. She overwhelmed where others
persuaded, bludgeoned where others tried diplomacy or the Game of
Houses. Anyone who knew her saw her intelligence, but only after a
time did you realize that for all her brains, she saw what she
wanted to see, would try to make true what she wanted to be true.
Of the two indisputably frightening things about her, the lesser
was that she so often succeeded. The greater was her Talent for
Foretelling.</p>

<p>So easy to forget that, erratic and infrequent; it
had been so long since the last Foretelling that the very
unpredictability made it strike like a thunderbolt. No one could
say when it would come, not even Elaida, and no one could say what
it would reveal. Now Alviarin almost felt the woman&rsquo;s shadowy
presence following and watching.</p>

<p>It might be necessary to kill her yet. If so, Elaida
would not be the first she had killed in secret. Still, she
hesitated to take that step without orders, or at least
permission.</p>

<p>She entered her own apartments with a sense of
relief, as though Elaida&rsquo;s shade could not cross the
threshold. A foolish thought. If Elaida had a suspicion of the
truth, a thousand leagues would not keep her from Alviarin&rsquo;s
throat. Elaida would expect her to be hard at work, personally
penning orders for the Amyrlin&rsquo;s signature and seal&mdash;but
which of those orders were actually to be carried out had yet to be
decided. Not by Elaida, of course. Nor by herself.</p>

<p>The rooms were smaller than those Elaida occupied,
though the ceilings reached higher, and a balcony looked over the
great square in front of the Tower from a hundred feet up.
Sometimes she went out on the balcony to see Tar Valon spread out
before her, the greatest city in the world, filled with countless
thousands who were less than pieces on a stone&rsquo;s board. The
furnishings were Domani, pale striped wood inlaid with pearlshell
and amber, bright carpets in patterns of flowers and scrolls,
brighter tapestries of forest and flowers and grazing deer. They
had belonged to the last occupant of these rooms, and if she
retained them for any reason beyond not wanting to waste time
choosing new, it was to remind herself of the price of failure.
Leane Sharif had dabbled in schemes and failed, and now she was cut
off from the One Power forever, a helpless refugee dependent on
charity, doomed to a life of misery until she either ended it or
simply put her face to the wall and died. Alviarin had heard of a
few stilled women who managed to survive, but she would doubt those
stories until she met one. Not that she had the slightest desire to
do so.</p>

<p>Through the windows she could see the brightness of
early afternoon, yet before she was halfway across her sitting
room, the light suddenly faded into dim evening. The darkness did
not surprise her. She turned and went to her knees immediately. &ldquo;Great Mistress, I live to serve.&rdquo; A tall woman of dark shadow and
silver light stood before her. Mesaana.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me what happened, child.&rdquo; The voice was crystal
chimes.</p>

<p>On her knees, Alviarin repeated every word that
Elaida had said, though she wondered why it was necessary. In the
beginning she had left out unimportant bits, and Mesaana knew every
time, demanded <em>every</em> word, every gesture and facial
expression. Plainly she eavesdropped on those meetings. Alviarin
had tried to work out the logic of it and failed. Some things did
work to logic, though.</p>

<p>She had met others of the Chosen, whom fools called
the Forsaken. Lanfear had come within the Tower, and Graendal,
imperious in their strength and knowledge, making it clear without
words that Alviarin was far beneath them, a scullery maid to run
errands and wriggle with pleasure if she received a kind word.
Be&rsquo;lal had snatched Alviarin away in the night while she slept&mdash;to where she still did not know; she had wakened back in her
own bed, and that had terrified her even more than being in the
presence of a man who could channel. To him she was not even a
worm, not even a living thing, just a piece in a game, to move at
his command. First had been Ishamael, years before the others,
plucking her out of the hidden mass of the Black Ajah to place her
at its head.</p>

<p>To each she had knelt, saying that she lived to serve
and meaning it, obeying as they commanded, whatever the command.
After all, they stood only a step below the Great Lord of the Dark
himself, and if she wanted the rewards of her service, the
immortality it seemed they already possessed, it was well to obey.
To each she knelt, and only Mesaana had appeared with an inhuman
face. This cloak of shadow and light must be woven with the One
Power, but Alviarin could see no weave. She had felt the strength
of Lanfear and Graendal, had known from the first instant how much
stronger in the Power they were than she, but in Mesaana she sensed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;nothing. As if the woman could not channel at all.</p>

<p>The logic was clear, and stunning. Mesaana hid
herself because she might be recognized. She must reside in the
Tower itself. On the face of it, that seemed impossible, yet
nothing else fit. Given that, she must be one of the sisters;
surely she was not among servants, bound to labor and sweat. But
who? Too many women had been out of the Tower for years before
Elaida&rsquo;s summons, too many had no close friends, or none at
all. Mesaana must be one of those. Alviarin very much wanted to
know. Even if she could make no use of it, knowledge was power.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So our Elaida has had a Foretelling,&rdquo; Mesaana
chimed, and Alviarin realized with a start that she had reached the
end of her recital. Her knees hurt, but she knew better than to
rise without permission. A finger of shadow tapped silver lips
thoughtfully. Had she seen any sister make that gesture? &ldquo;Strange
that she should be so clear and so erratic at the same time. It was
always a rare Talent, and most who had it spoke so only poets could
understand. Usually until it was too late to matter, at least.
Everything always became clear then.&rdquo; Alviarin kept silent. None of
the Chosen conversed; they commanded or demanded. &ldquo;Interesting
predictions. The rebels breaking&mdash;like a rotten melon?&mdash;was that part of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not certain, Great Mistress,&rdquo; she said slowly&mdash;had it been?&mdash;but Mesaana only shrugged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Either it is or it is not, and either way can be
used.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is dangerous, Great Mistress. Her Talent could
reveal what should not be revealed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crystalline laughter answered her. &ldquo;Such as? You?
Your Black Ajah sisters? Or perhaps you think to safeguard me? You
are a good girl sometimes, child.&rdquo; That silvery voice was amused.
Alviarin felt her face heat and hoped that Mesaana read the shame,
not the anger. &ldquo;Do you suggest that our Elaida should be disposed
of, child? Not yet, I think. She has her uses still. At least until
young al&rsquo;Thor reaches us, and very likely after. Write out her
orders and see to them. Watching her play her little games is
certainly amusing. You children almost match the <em>ajah</em> at
times. Will she succeed in having the King of Illian and the Queen
of Saldaea kidnapped? You Aes Sedai used to do that, didn&rsquo;t
you, but not for&mdash;what?&mdash;two thousand years? Who will
she try to put on the throne of Cairhien? Will the offer of being
king in Tear overcome the High Lord Darlin&rsquo;s dislike of Aes
Sedai? Will our Elaida choke on her own frustration first? A pity
she resists the idea of a larger army. I&rsquo;d have thought her
ambitions would leap at that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The interview was coming to a close&mdash;they never
lasted longer than for Alviarin to report and be given her own
orders&mdash;but she had a question yet to ask. &ldquo;The Black Tower,
Great Mistress.&rdquo; Alviarin wet her lips. She had learned much since
Ishamael appeared to her, not least that the Chosen were neither
omnipotent nor all-knowing. She had risen because Ishamael killed
her predecessor in his wrath at discovering what Jarna Malari had
begun, yet it had not ended for another two years, after the death
of another Amyrlin. She often wondered whether Elaida had had any
hand in the death of that one, Sierin Vayu; certainly the Black
Ajah had not. Jarna had had Tamra Ospenya, the Amyrlin before
Sierin, squeezed like a bunch of grapes&mdash;obtaining little
juice, as it turned out&mdash;and made her appear to have died in
her sleep, but Alviarin and the other twelve sisters of the Great
Council had paid in pain before they could convince Ishamael they
had no responsibility for it. The Chosen were not all-powerful, and
they did not know everything, yet sometimes they knew what no one
else did. Asking could be dangerous, though. &ldquo;Why&rdquo; was the most
dangerous; the Chosen never liked to be asked why. &ldquo;Is it safe to
send fifty sisters to deal with them, Great Mistress?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eyes glowing like twin full moons regarded her in
silence, and a chill slid up Alviarin&rsquo;s spine. Jarna&rsquo;s
fate flashed into her mind. Publicly Gray, Jarna had never shown
any interest in the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> no one knew a use for&mdash;until the day she became snared in one untried for
centuries. How to activate it remained a mystery still. For ten
days no one could reach her, only listen to her throat-wrenching
shrieks. Most of the Tower thought Jarna a model of virtue; when
what could be recovered was buried, every sister in Tar Valon and
every one who could reach the city in time attended the
funeral.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have curiosity, child,&rdquo; Mesaana said finally. &ldquo;That can be an asset, properly directed. Wrongly directed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;
The threat hung in the air like a gleaming dagger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will direct it as you command, Great Mistress,&rdquo;
Alviarin breathed hoarsely. Her mouth was dry as dust. &ldquo;Only as you
command.&rdquo; But she would still see that no Black sisters went with
Toveine. Mesaana moved, looming over her so she had to crane her
neck to look up at that face of light and shadow, and suddenly she
wondered whether the Chosen knew her thoughts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you would serve me, child, then you must serve
and obey me. Not Semirhage or Demandred. Not Graendal or anyone
else. Only me. And the Great Lord, of course, but me above all save
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I live to serve you, Great Mistress.&rdquo; That came out
in a croak, but she managed to emphasize the added word.</p>

<p>For a long moment silvery eyes stared down at her
unblinking. Then Mesaana said, &ldquo;Good. I will teach you, then. But
remember that a pupil is not a teacher. I choose who learns what,
and I decide when they can make use of it. Should I find you have
passed on the smallest scrap or used even a hair of it without my
direction, I will extinguish you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alviarin worked moisture back into her mouth. There
was no anger in those chimes, only certainty. &ldquo;I live to serve you,
Great Mistress. I live to obey you, Great Mistress.&rdquo; She had just
learned something about the Chosen that she could hardly credit.
Knowledge was power.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a little strength, child. Not much, but
enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A weave appeared seemingly from nowhere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; Mesaana chimed, &ldquo;is called a gateway.&rdquo;</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Pedron Niall grunted as Morgase placed a white stone
on the board with a smile of triumph. Lesser players might set two
dozen more stones each yet, but he could see the inevitable course
now, and so could she. In the beginning the golden-haired woman
seated on the other side of the small table had played to lose, to
make the game close enough to be interesting for him, but it had
not taken her long to learn that that led to obliteration. Not to
mention that he was clever enough to see through the subterfuge and
would not tolerate it. Now she plied all her skill and managed to
win nearly half their games. No one had beaten him so often in a
good many years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The game is yours,&rdquo; he told her, and the Queen of
Andor nodded. Well, she would be Queen again; he would see to that.
In green silk, with a high lace collar brushing her chin, she
looked every inch a queen despite the sheen of perspiration on her
smooth cheeks. She hardly appeared old enough to have a daughter
Elayne&rsquo;s age, though, much less a son Gawyn&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not realize I saw the trap you were laying
from your thirty-first stone, Lord Niall, and you took my feint
from the forty-third stone to be my real attack.&rdquo; Excitement
sparkled in her blue eyes; Morgase liked to win. She liked playing
to win.</p>

<p>It was all meant to lull him, of course, the playing
at stones, the politeness. Morgase knew she was a prisoner in the
Fortress of the Light in all but name, albeit a luxuriously
pampered prisoner. And a secret one. He had allowed stories of her
presence to spread, but issued no proclamations. Andor had too
strong a history of opposing the Children of the Light. He would
announce nothing until legions moved into Andor, with her their
figurehead. Morgase certainly knew that, as well. Very probably she
also knew he was aware of her attempts to soften him. The treaty
she had signed gave the Children rights in Andor they had never
possessed anywhere except here in Amadicia, and he expected that
she already planned how to lighten his hand on her land, how to
remove his hand altogether as soon as she could. She had only
signed because he backed her into a corner, yet confined in that
corner, she fought on as skillfully as she maneuvered on a stones
board. For one so beautiful, she was a tough woman. No, she was
tough, and that was that. She did let herself be caught up for the
pure pleasure of the game, but he could not count that a fault when
it gave him so many pleasant moments.</p>

<p>Had he been even twenty years younger, he might have
played more to her true game. Long years as a widower stretched
behind him, and the Lord Captain Commander of the Children of the
Light had little time for pleasantries with women, little time for
anything except <em>being</em> Lord Captain Commander. Had he been
twenty years younger&mdash;well, twenty-five&mdash;and she not
trained by the Tar Valon witches. It was easy to forget that, in
her presence. The White Tower was a sink of iniquity and the
Shadow, and she touched deeply by it. Rhadam Asunawa, the High
Inquisitor, would have tried her for her months in the White Tower
and hanged her without delay, had Niall allowed it. He sighed
regretfully.</p>

<p>Morgase kept her victorious smile, but those big eyes
studied his face with an intelligence she could not hide. He filled
her goblet and his own with wine from the silver pitcher sitting in
a bowl of cool water that had been ice a little while ago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord Niall&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; The hesitation was just right,
the slim hand half-stretched across the table toward him, the added
respect in how she addressed him. Once she had called him simply
Niall, with more contempt than she would have handed a drunken
groom. The hesitation would have been just right had he not had the
measure of her. &ldquo;My Lord Niall, surely you can order Galad to
Amador so I may see him. Just for a day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I regret,&rdquo; he replied smoothly, &ldquo;that Galad&rsquo;s
duties keep him in the north. You should be proud; he is one of the
best young officers among the Children.&rdquo; Her stepson was a lever to
use on her at need, one best used now by keeping him away. The
young man <em>was</em> a good officer, perhaps the best to join the
Children in Niall&rsquo;s time, and there was no need to put strains
on his oath by letting him know his mother was here, and a &ldquo;guest&rdquo;
only by courtesy.</p>

<p>No more than a slight tightening of her mouth,
quickly gone, betrayed her disappointment. This was not the first
time she had made that request, nor would it be the last. Morgase
Trakand did not surrender just because it was plain she was beaten. &ldquo;As you say, my Lord Niall,&rdquo; she said, so meekly that he nearly
choked on his wine. Submissiveness was a new tactic, one she must
have worked up with difficulty. &ldquo;It is just a mother&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord Captain Commander?&rdquo; a deep, resonant voice
broke in from the doorway. &ldquo;I fear I have important news that
cannot wait, my Lord.&rdquo; Abdel Omerna stood tall in the
white-and-gold tabard of a Lord Captain of the Children of the
Light, bold face framed by wings of white at his temples, dark eyes
deep and thoughtful. From head to toe he was fearless and
commanding. And a fool, though that was not apparent at a
glance.</p>

<p>Morgase drew in on herself at the sight of Omerna, so
small a motion most men would not have noticed. She believed him
spymaster for the Children, as everyone did, a man to be feared
almost as much as Asunawa, perhaps more. Even Omerna himself did
not know he was but a decoy to keep eyes away from the true master
of spies, a man known only to Niall himself. Sebban Balwer,
Niall&rsquo;s dry little stick of a secretary. Yet decoy or not,
something useful did pass through Omerna&rsquo;s hands on occasion.
On rare occasions, something dire. Niall had no doubts what the man
had brought; nothing else except Rand al&rsquo;Thor at the gates
would have sent him barging in this way. The Light send it was all
a rug merchant&rsquo;s madness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear our gaming is done for this morning,&rdquo; Niall
told Morgase, standing. He offered her a slight bow as she rose,
and she acknowledged it by inclining her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Until this evening, perhaps?&rdquo; Her voice still held
that almost docile tone. &ldquo;That is, if you will dine with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Niall accepted, of course. He did not know where she
was leading with this new tactic&mdash;not where an oaf might
suppose, he was sure&mdash;but it would be amusing to find out.
The woman was full of surprises. Such a pity she was tainted by the
witches.</p>

<p>Omerna advanced as far as the great sunflare of gold,
set in the floor, that had been worn by feet and knees over
centuries. It was a plain room aside from that and the captured
banners that lined the walls high beneath the ceiling, age-tattered
and worn. Omerna watched her skirt around him without really
acknowledging his presence, and when the door closed behind her, he
said, &ldquo;I have not yet found Elayne or Gawyn, my Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is <em>that</em> your important news?&rdquo; Niall
demanded irritably. Balwer reported Morgase&rsquo;s daughter in Ebou
Dar, still mired to her neck with the witches; orders concerning
her had already been sent to Jaichim Carridin. Her other son still
toiled with the witches as well, it seemed, in Tar Valon, where
even Balwer possessed few eyes-and-ears. Niall took a long swallow
of cool wine. His bones felt old and brittle and cold of late, yet
the Shadowspawned heat made his skin sweat enough, and dried his
mouth.</p>

<p>Omerna gave a start. &ldquo;Ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;no, my Lord.&rdquo; He
fumbled in a pocket of his white undercoat and pulled, out a tiny
bone cylinder with three red stripes running its length. &ldquo;You
wanted this brought as soon as the pigeon arrived in the&mdash;&rdquo;
He cut off as Niall snatched the tube.</p>

<p>This was what he had been waiting for, the reason a
legion was not already on its way to Andor with Morgase riding at
its head, if not leading. If it was not all Varadin&rsquo;s madness,
the ravings of a man unbalanced by watching Tarabon collapse into
anarchy, Andor would have to wait. Andor, and maybe more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I have confirmation that the White Tower
truly has broken,&rdquo; Omerna went on. &ldquo;The&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the Black Ajah has
seized Tar Valon.&rdquo; No wonder he sounded nervous, speaking heresy.
There was no Black Ajah; all of the witches were Darkfriends.</p>

<p>Niall ignored him and broke the wax sealing the tube
with his thumbnail. He had used Balwer to start those rumors, and
now they came back to him. Omerna believed every rumor his ears
caught, and his ears caught them all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And there are reports that the witches are
conferring with the false Dragon al&rsquo;Thor, my Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course the witches were conferring with him! He
was their creation, their puppet. Niall shut out the fool&rsquo;s
blather and moved back to the gaming table while he drew a slim
roll of paper from the tube. He never let anyone know more of these
messages than that they existed, and few knew that much. His hands
trembled as they unrolled the thin paper. His hands had not
trembled since he was a boy facing his first battle, more than
seventy years ago. Those hands seemed little more than bone and
sinew now, but they still possessed enough strength for what he had
to do.</p>

<p>The writing was not that of Varadin, but of Faisar,
sent to Tarabon for a different purpose. Niall&rsquo;s stomach
twisted into a knot as he read; it was in clear language, not
Varadin&rsquo;s cipher. Varadin&rsquo;s reports had been the work of
a man on the brink of madness if not over, yet Faisar confirmed the
worst of it and more. Much more. Al&rsquo;Thor was a rabid beast, a
destroyer who must be stopped, but now a second mad animal had
appeared, one that might be even more dangerous than the Tar Valon
witches with their tame false Dragon. But how under the Light could
he fight both?</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;it seems that Queen Tenobia has left
Saldaea, my Lord. And the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the Dragonsworn are burning and
killing across Altara and Murandy. I have heard the Horn of Valere
has been found, in Kandor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still half-distracted, Niall looked up to find Omerna
at his side, licking his lips and wiping sweat from his forehead
with the back of his hand. No doubt he hoped for a glance at what
was in the message. Well, everyone would know soon enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems one of your wilder fancies wasn&rsquo;t so
wild after all,&rdquo; Niall said, and that was when he felt the knife go
in under his ribs.</p>

<p>Shock froze him long enough for Omerna to pull the
dagger free and plunge it in again. Other Lord Captain Commanders
had died this way before him, yet he had never thought it would be
Omerna. He tried to grapple with his killer, but there was no force
in his arms. He hung on to Omerna with the man supporting him, the
pair of them eye to eye.</p>

<p>Omerna&rsquo;s face was red; he looked ready to weep. &ldquo;It had to be done. It had to be. You let the witches sit there in
Salidar unhindered, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; As if suddenly realizing that he
had his arms around the man he was murdering, he pushed Niall
away.</p>

<p>Strength had gone from Niall&rsquo;s legs now as well
as his arms. He fell heavily against the gaming table, turning it
over. Black and white stones scattered across the polished wooden
floor around him; the silver pitcher bounced and splashed wine. The
cold in his bones was leaching out into the rest of him.</p>

<p>He was not certain whether time had slowed for him or
everything really did happen so quickly. Boots thudded across the
floor, and he lifted his head wearily to see Omerna gaping and
wide-eyed, backing away from Eamon Valda. Every bit as much the
picture of a Lord Captain as Omerna in his white-and-gold tabard
and white undercoat, Valda was not so tall, not so plainly
commanding, but the dark man&rsquo;s face was hard, as ever, and he
had a sword in his hands, the heron-mark blade he prized so
highly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Treason!&rdquo; Valda bellowed, and drove the sword
through Omerna&rsquo;s chest.</p>

<p>Niall would have laughed if he could; breath came
hard, and he could hear it bubbling in the blood in his throat. He
had never liked Valda&mdash;in fact, he despised the man&mdash;but someone had to know. His eyes shifted, found the slip of paper
from Tanchico lying not far from his hand; it might be missed
there, but not if his corpse clutched it. And that message had to
be read. His hand seemed to crawl across the floorboards so slowly,
brushing the paper, pushing, it as he fumbled to take hold. His
vision was growing misty. He tried to force himself to see. He had
to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The fog was thicker. Part of him tried to shake that
thought; there was no fog. The fog was thicker, and there was an
enemy out there, unseen, hidden, as dangerous as al&rsquo;Thor or
more. The message. What? What message? It was time to mount and out
sword, time for one last attack. By the Light, win or die, he was
coming! He tried to snarl.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Valda wiped his blade on Omerna&rsquo;s tabard, then
suddenly realized the old wolf still breathed, a rasping, bubbling
sound. Grimacing, he bent to make an end&mdash;and a gaunt,
long-fingered hand caught his arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you be Lord Captain Commander now, my son?&rdquo;
Asunawa&rsquo;s emaciated face belonged on a martyr, yet his dark
eyes burned with a fervor to unnerve even those who did not know
who he was. &ldquo;You may well be, after I attest that you killed Pedron
Niall&rsquo;s assassin. But not if I must say that you ripped open
Niall&rsquo;s throat as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Baring teeth in what could pass for a smile, Valda
straightened. Asunawa had a love of truth, a strange love; he could
tie it into knots, or hang it up and flay it while it screamed, but
so far as Valda knew, he never actually lied. A look at
Niall&rsquo;s glazed eyes, and the pool of blood spreading beneath
him, satisfied Valda. The old man was dying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May, Asunawa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The High Inquisitor&rsquo;s gaze burned hotter as
Asunawa stepped back, moving the snowy cloak away from Niall&rsquo;s
blood. Even a Lord Captain was not supposed to be that familiar. &ldquo;I
said may, my son. You have been oddly reluctant to agree that the
witch Morgase must be given to the Hand of the Light. Unless you
give that assurance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Morgase is needed yet.&rdquo; Breaking in gave Valda
considerable pleasure. He did not like Questioners, the Hand of the
Light as they called themselves. Who could like men who never met
an enemy not disarmed and in chains? They held themselves apart
from the Children, separate. Asunawa&rsquo;s cloak bore only the
scarlet shepherd&rsquo;s crook of the Questioners, not the flaring
golden sun of the Children that graced his own tabard. Worse, they
seemed to think their work with racks and hot irons was the only
true work of the Children. &ldquo;Morgase gives us Andor, so you cannot
have her before we have it. And we cannot take Andor until the
Prophet&rsquo;s mobs are crushed.&rdquo; The Prophet had to be first,
preaching the coming of the Dragon Reborn, his mobs burning
villages too slow to proclaim for al&rsquo;Thor. Niall&rsquo;s chest
barely moved, now. &ldquo;Unless you want to trade Amadicia for Andor,
instead of holding both? I mean to see al&rsquo;Thor hung and the
White Tower ground to dust, Asunawa, and I did not go along with
your plan just to see you toss it all on the midden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Asunawa was not taken aback; he was no coward. Not
here, with hundreds of Questioners in the Fortress and most of the
Children wary of putting a foot wrong around them. He ignored the
sword in Valda&rsquo;s hands, and that martyr&rsquo;s face took on a
look of sadness. His sweat seemed to be tears of regret. &ldquo;In that
case, since Lord Captain Canvele believes that the law must be
obeyed, I fear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> fear Canvele agrees with me, Asunawa.&rdquo;
Since dawn he did, since he realized that Valda had brought half a
legion into the Fortress. Canvele was no fool. &ldquo;The question is not
whether I will be Lord Captain Commander when the sun sets today,
but who will guide the Hand of the Light in its digging for
truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No coward, Asunawa, and even less a fool than
Canvele. He neither flinched nor demanded how Valda thought to
bring this about. &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said after a moment, and then,
mildly, &ldquo;Do you mean to flout the law entirely, my son?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Valda almost laughed. &ldquo;You can examine Morgase, but
she is not to be put to the question. You can have her for that
when I am done with her.&rdquo; Which might take a little time; finding a
replacement for the Lion Throne, one who understood her proper
relationship to the Children as King Ailron did here, would not
happen overnight.</p>

<p>Perhaps Asunawa understood and perhaps not. He opened
his mouth, and there was a gasp from the doorway. Niall&rsquo;s
pinch-faced secretary stood there, purse-mouthed and knobby, narrow
eyes trying to stare at everything except the bodies stretched out
on the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A sad day, Master Balwer,&rdquo; Asunawa intoned, his
voice sorrowful iron. &ldquo;The traitor Omerna has slain our Lord
Captain Commander Pedron Niall, the Light illumine his soul.&rdquo; Not
an advance on the truth; Niall&rsquo;s chest no longer moved, and
killing him had been treason. &ldquo;Lord Captain Valda entered too late
to save him, but he did slay Omerna in the full depth of his sin.&rdquo;
Balwer gave a start and began dry-washing his hands.</p>

<p>The birdlike fellow made Valda itch. &ldquo;Since you are
here, Balwer, you may as well be useful.&rdquo; He disliked useless
people, and the scribbler was the very form of uselessness. &ldquo;Carry
this message to each Lord Captain in the Fortress. Tell them the
Lord Captain Commander has been murdered, and I call for a meeting
of the Council of the Anointed.&rdquo; His first act on being named Lord
Captain Commander would be to boot the dried-up little man out of
the Fortress, boot him so far he bounced twice, and choose a
secretary who did not twitch. &ldquo;Whether Omerna was bought by the
witches or the Prophet, I mean to see Pedron Niall avenged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you say, my Lord.&rdquo; Balwer&rsquo;s voice was dry
and narrow. &ldquo;It shall be as you say.&rdquo; He apparently found himself
able to look on Niall&rsquo;s body at last; as he bowed himself out
jerkily, he hardly looked at anything else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it seems you will be our next Lord Captain
Commander after all,&rdquo; Asunawa said once Balwer was gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it seems,&rdquo; Valda answered dryly. A tiny slip of
paper lay next to Niall&rsquo;s outstretched hand, the sort used in
sending messages by pigeon. Valda bent and picked it up, then
exhaled in disgust. The paper had been sitting in a puddle of wine;
whatever had been written on it was lost, the ink a blur.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the Hand will have Morgase when your need for
her is done.&rdquo; That was not in the slightest a question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will hand her to you myself.&rdquo; Perhaps a little
something might be arranged to sate Asunawa&rsquo;s appetite for a
while. It might make sure Morgase remained amenable, too. Valda
dropped the bit of rubbish on Niall&rsquo;s corpse. The old wolf had
lost his cunning and his nerve with age, and now it would be up to
Eamon Valda to bring the witches and their false Dragon to
heel.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Flat on his belly on a rise, Gawyn surveyed disaster
beneath the afternoon sun. Dumai&rsquo;s Wells lay miles to the
south now, across rolling plain and low hills, but he could still
see the smoke from burning wagons. What had happened there after he
led what he could gather of the Younglings in breaking out, he did
not know. Al&rsquo;Thor had seemed well in charge, al&rsquo;Thor and
those black-coated men who appeared to be channeling, taking down
Aes Sedai and Aiel alike. It had been the realization that sisters
were fleeing that told him it was time to go.</p>

<p>He wished he could have killed al&rsquo;Thor. For his
mother, dead by the man&rsquo;s doing; Egwene denied it, but she had
no proof. For his sister. If Min had spoken the truth&mdash;he
should have made her leave the camp with him, whatever she wanted;
there was too much he should have done differently today&mdash;if
Min was right, and Elayne loved al&rsquo;Thor, then that dreadful
fate was reason enough to kill. Maybe the Aiel had done the work
for him. He doubted it, though.</p>

<p>With a sour laugh he raised the tube of his looking
glass. One of the golden bands bore an inscription. &ldquo;From Morgase,
Queen of Andor, to her beloved son, Gawyn. May he be a living sword
for his sister and Andor.&rdquo; Bitter words, now.</p>

<p>There was not much to see beyond sere grass and
small, scattered clumps of trees. The wind still gusted, raising
waves of dust. Occasionally a flash of movement in a crease between
squat ridges spoke of men on the move. Aiel, he was sure. They
blended with the land too well to be green-coated Younglings. The
Light send that more had escaped than those he had brought out.</p>

<p>He was a fool. He should have killed al&rsquo;Thor; he
had to kill him. But he could not. Not because the man was the
Dragon Reborn, but because he had promised Egwene not to raise a
hand against al&rsquo;Thor. As a lowly Accepted, she had vanished
from Cairhien, leaving Gawyn only a letter that he had read and
reread until the paper was ready to tear along the folds, and he
would be unsurprised to learn she had gone to aid al&rsquo;Thor in
some way. He could not break his word, least of all to the woman he
loved. Never his word to her. Whatever the cost to himself. He
hoped she would accept the compromise he had made with his honor;
he had raised not a hand to harm, but none to help, either. The
Light send she never asked that of him. It was said that love
addled men&rsquo;s brains, and he was the proof.</p>

<p>Suddenly he pressed the looking glass to his eye as a
woman galloped a tall black horse into the open. He could not make
out her face, but no servant would be wearing a dress divided for
riding. So at least one Aes Sedai had managed to escape. If sisters
had made it out of the trap alive, maybe more of the Younglings had
too. With luck, he could find them before they were killed in small
groups by the Aiel. First there was the matter of this sister,
though. In many ways he would rather have gone on without her, but
leaving her alone, maybe to take an arrow she never saw coming, was
not an option he could allow himself. As he started to rise and
wave to her, though, the horse stumbled and fell, pitching her over
its head.</p>

<p>He cursed, then again when the looking glass showed
him an arrow standing up from the black&rsquo;s side. Hastily he
scanned the hills, and bit down on another curse; maybe two dozen
veiled Aiel stood on a crest staring toward downed horse and rider,
less than a hundred paces from the Aes Sedai. Quickly he glanced
back. The sister rose unsteadily to her feet. If she kept her wits
and used the Power, there should be no way a few Aiel could harm
her, especially if she took shelter against more arrows behind the
fallen horse. Even so, he would feel better when he had gathered
her in. Rolling away from the crest to lessen the chances of the
Aiel seeing him, he slid down the reverse slope until he could
stand.</p>

<p>He had brought five hundred and eighty-one Younglings
south, almost every one who was far enough along in training to
leave Tar Valon, but fewer than two hundred waited on their horses
in the hollow. Before disaster struck at Dumai&rsquo;s Wells, he was
certain there had been a plot afoot to see that he and the
Younglings died without returning to the White Tower. Why, he did
not know, nor whether the scheme came from Elaida or Galina, but it
had succeeded well enough, if not exactly in the way its devisers
had thought. Small wonder that he would have preferred to go on
without Aes Sedai, had he any choice.</p>

<p>He stopped beside a tall gray gelding with a young
rider. Young, as indeed all the Younglings were&mdash;many did not
need to shave beyond every third day, and a few still only
pretended even that&mdash;but Jisao wore the silver tower on his
collar, marking him a veteran of the fighting when Siuan Sanche was
deposed, and scars beneath his clothes from fighting since. He was
one of those who could skip the razor most mornings; his dark eyes
belonged to a man thirty years older, though. What did his own eyes
look like, Gawyn wondered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jisao, we have a sister to pull out of the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hundred or so Aiel who came trotting over the low
rise to the west recoiled in surprise at finding the Younglings
below, but neither surprise nor the Younglings&rsquo; superior
numbers held them back. In a flash they veiled and plunged down the
slope, darting in with spears stabbing at horses as often as
riders, working in pairs. Yet if the Aiel knew how to fight men on
horseback, the Younglings had recently had rough lessons in how to
fight Aiel, and slow learners did not live long in their ranks.
Some carried slender lances, ending in a foot and a half of steel
with a crossguard to prevent the head penetrating too deeply, and
all could use their swords as well as any but a blademaster. They
fought in twos and threes, each man watching another&rsquo;s back,
keeping their mounts moving so the Aiel could not hamstring the
animals. Only the quickest Aiel managed to get inside those circles
of flashing steel. The war-trained horses themselves were weapons,
splitting skulls with their hooves, seizing men with their teeth
and shaking them like dogs worrying rats, jaws tearing away half a
man&rsquo;s face. The horses screamed as they fought, and men
grunted with effort, shouted with the fever that overtook men in
battle, the fever that said they were alive and would live to see
another sunrise if they had to wade waist-deep in blood. They
shouted as they killed, shouted as they died; there seemed little
difference.</p>

<p>Gawyn had no time to watch or listen, though. The
only Youngling afoot, he attracted attention. Three
<em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em>-clad figures dodged through the horsemen,
rushing at him with spears ready. Perhaps they thought him easy
meat, three on one. He disabused them. His sword left the scabbard
smoothly, as smoothly as he flowed from The Falcon Stoops to The
Creeper Embraces the Oak to The Moon Rises Over the Lakes. Three
times he felt the shock in his wrists of blade meeting flesh, and
that quickly three veiled Aielmen were down; two still moving
weakly, but they were out of the fight as much as the other. The
next to confront him was a different matter.</p>

<p>A lean fellow, overtopping Gawyn by a hand, he moved
like a snake, spear flickering while his buckler darted and slanted
to deflect sword strokes with a force Gawyn could feel to his
shoulders. The Wood Grouse Dances became Folding the Air became The
Courtier Taps His Fan, and the Aielman met each of them at the cost
of a slash along his ribs, while Gawyn took a gash on his thigh
that only a quick twist kept from being a stab clean through.</p>

<p>They circled one another, oblivious to whatever
happened around them. Blood oozed hot down Gawyn&rsquo;s leg. The
Aielman feinted, hoping to draw him off balance, feinted again;
Gawyn shifted from stance to stance, sword now high, now low,
hoping the man would extend one of those half-thrusts just a little
too far.</p>

<p>In the end, it was chance that decided matters. The
Aielman abruptly stumbled a step, and Gawyn ran him through the
heart before he even saw the horse that had backed into the
man.</p>

<p>Once he would have felt regret; he had grown up
believing that if two men must fight, the duel should proceed
honorably and cleanly. More than half a year of battles and
skirmishes had taught him better. He put a foot on the
Aielman&rsquo;s chest and wrenched his blade free. Ungallant, but
fast, and in battle, slow was often dead.</p>

<p>Only, when his sword was free, there was no need for
speed. Men were down, Younglings and Aielmen, some groaning, some
still, and the rest of the Aiel streaming away to the east, harried
by two dozen Younglings, including some who should know better. &ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; he shouted. If the idiots allowed themselves to become
separated, the Aiel would cut them to dogmeat. &ldquo;No pursuit! Hold, I
said! Hold, burn you!&rdquo; The Younglings pulled up reluctantly.</p>

<p>Jisao reined his gelding around. &ldquo;They just thought
to cut a path through us on the way wherever they&rsquo;re going, my
Lord.&rdquo; His sword dripped red from half its length.</p>

<p>Gawyn caught the reins of his own bay stallion and
swung into the saddle, not waiting to clean or sheath his blade. No
time to see who was dead, who might live. &ldquo;Forget them. That sister
is waiting for us. Hal, keep your half-troop to look after the
wounded. And watch those Aiel; just because they&rsquo;re dying
doesn&rsquo;t mean they have quit. The rest, follow me.&rdquo; Hal saluted
with his sword, but Gawyn was already digging in his spurs.</p>

<p>The skirmish had not lasted long, yet too long
however short. When Gawyn reached the crest, only the dead horse
was to be seen, its saddlebags turned out. Scanning through his
looking glass revealed not a sign of the sister, the Aiel or
anything else living. All that moved was windblown dust and a dress
on the ground near the horse, stirring in the gusts. The woman must
have sprinted to be so completely out of sight so quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t have gone far, even running,&rdquo; Jisao
said. &ldquo;We can find her if we fan out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll search after we see to the wounded,&rdquo;
Gawyn replied firmly. He was not about to split up his men with
Aiel roaming loose. Only a few hours yet till sunset, and he wanted
a tight camp on high ground before then. It might be as well if he
did manage to find a sister or two; someone was going to have to
explain this catastrophe to Elaida, and he would as soon it was an
Aes Sedai facing her wrath, not him.</p>

<p>Turning his bay with a sigh, he rode back down to see
what the butcher&rsquo;s bill had been this time. That had been his
first real lesson as a soldier. You always had to pay the butcher.
He had a feeling there would be bigger bills due soon. The world
would forget Dumai&rsquo;s Wells in what was coming.</p>
