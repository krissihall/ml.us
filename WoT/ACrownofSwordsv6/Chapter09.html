<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">E</span>gwene
was sitting in her chair&mdash;one of the few
real chairs in the camp, with a little plain carving like a
farmer&rsquo;s best armchair, roomy and comfortable enough that she
felt only a touch of guilt about taking up valuable wagon space for
it&mdash;she was sitting there trying to pull her thoughts
together when Siuan swept aside the entry flaps and ducked into the
tent. Siuan was not happy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why in the Light did you run off?&rdquo; Her voice had not
changed with her face, and she chided with the best even when she
did it in respectful tones. Barely respectful. Her blue eyes
remained the same, too; they could have done for a
saddlemaker&rsquo;s awls. &ldquo;Sheriam brushed me aside like a fly.&rdquo;
That surprisingly delicate mouth twisted bitterly. &ldquo;She was gone
almost as soon as you were. Don&rsquo;t you realize she handed
herself to you? She certainly does. Her, and Anaiya and Morvrin and
the lot of them. You can be sure they&rsquo;ll spend tonight trying
to bail water and patch holes. They could manage it. I don&rsquo;t
see how, but they might.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Almost as the last word left her mouth, Leane
entered. A tall, willowy woman, her coppery face was as youthful as
Siuan&rsquo;s, and for the same reason; she also was more than old
enough to be Egwene&rsquo;s mother, in truth. Leane took one look at
Siuan and threw up her hands as much as the roof of the tent would
allow. &ldquo;Mother, this is a foolish risk.&rdquo; Her dark eyes went from
dreamy to flashing, but her voice had a languorous quality even
when she was irritated. Once, it had been brisk. &ldquo;If anyone sees
Siuan and me together this way&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if the whole camp learns your
squabbling is a fraud,&rdquo; Egwene broke in sharply, weaving a small
barrier against eavesdropping around the three of them. It could be
worked through with time, but not without detection, so long as she
held the weave instead of tying it off.</p>

<p>She did care, and perhaps she should not have called
them both, but her first half-coherent thought had been to summon
the two sisters she could count on. No one in the camp so much as
suspected. Everyone knew the former Amyrlin and her former Keeper
detested one another every bit as much as Siuan detested being
tutor to her successor. Should any sister uncover the truth, they
might well find themselves doing penance for a long time to come,
and not an easy one&mdash;Aes Sedai appreciated being made fools
of even less than other people; <em>kings</em> had been made to pay
for that&mdash;but in the meanwhile their supposed animosity
resulted in a certain leverage with the other sisters, including
Sitters. If <em>they</em> both said the same thing, it must be so.
Another incidental effect of being stilled was very useful, one no
one else knew about. The Three Oaths no longer held them; they
could lie like wool merchants, now.</p>

<p>Schemes and deceptions on every side. The camp was
like some fetid swamp where strange growths sprouted unseen in
mists. Maybe anywhere Aes Sedai gathered was like that. After three
thousand years of plotting, however necessary, it was hardly
surprising that scheming had become second nature to most sisters
and only a breath away for the rest. The truly horrible thing was
that she found herself beginning to enjoy all the machinations. Not
for their own sake, but as puzzles, though no twisted bits of iron
could intrigue her a quarter so much. What that said about her, she
did not want to know. Well, she <em>was</em> Aes Sedai, whatever
anyone thought, and she had to take the bad of it with the
good.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moghedien has escaped,&rdquo; she went on without pause. &ldquo;A man removed the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> from her. A man who can
channel. I think one of them took the necklace away; it wasn&rsquo;t
in her tent, that I saw. There might be some way to find it using
the bracelet, but if there is, I don&rsquo;t know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That took the starch right out of them. Leane&rsquo;s
legs gave way, and she dropped like a sack onto the stool Chesa
sometimes used. Siuan sat down on the cot slowly, back very
straight, hands very still on her knees. Incongruously, Egwene
noticed that her dress had tiny blue flowers embroidered in a wide
Tairen maze around the bottom, a band that made the divided skirts
seem one when she was still. Another band curved becomingly across
the bodice. Concern for her clothes, that they be pretty instead of
just suitable, was certainly a small change, looking at it one way&mdash;she never took it to extremes&mdash;yet in another, it was
as drastic as her face. And a puzzle. Siuan resented the changes,
and resisted them. Except for this one.</p>

<p>Leane, on the other hand, in true Aes Sedai fashion
embraced what had changed. A young woman again&mdash;Egwene had
overheard a Yellow exclaiming in wonder that both were prime
childbearing age, by everything she could find&mdash;she might
never have been Keeper, never have had any other face. The very
image of practicality and efficiency became the ideal of an
indolent and alluring Domani woman. Even her riding dress was cut
in the style of her native land, and no matter that its silk, so
thin it barely seemed opaque, was as impractical as the pale green
color for traveling dusty roads. Told that having been stilled had
broken all ties and associations, Leane had chosen the Green Ajah
over a return to the Blue. Changing Ajahs was not done, but then,
no one had been stilled and then Healed before, either. Siuan had
gone right back into the Blue, grumbling over the idiotic need to &ldquo;entreat and appeal for acceptance&rdquo; as the formal phrase went.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Light!&rdquo; Leane breathed as she thumped onto the
stool with considerably less than her usual grace. &ldquo;We should have
turned her over for trial the first day. Nothing we&rsquo;ve learned
from her is worth letting her loose on the world again. Nothing!&rdquo;
It was a measure of her shock; she did not normally go about
stating the obvious. Her brain had not grown indolent, whatever her
outward demeanor. Languid and seductive Domani women might be on
the outside, but they were still known as the sharpest traders
anywhere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blood and bloody&mdash;! We should have had her
watched,&rdquo; Siuan growled through her teeth.</p>

<p>Egwene&rsquo;s eyebrows rose. Siuan must be as shaken
as Leane. &ldquo;By who, Siuan? Faolain? Theodrin? They don&rsquo;t even
know you two are of my party.&rdquo; A party? Five women. And Faolain and
Theodrin were hardly eager adherents, especially Faolain. Nynaeve
and Elayne could be counted too, of course, and Birgitte certainly,
even if she was not Aes Sedai, but they were a long way off.
Stealth and cunning were still her major strengths. Plus the fact
that no one expected them of her. &ldquo;How should I have explained to
<em>anyone</em> why they were supposed to watch my serving woman?
For that matter, what good would it have done? It had to be one of
the Forsaken. Do you really think Faolain and Theodrin together
could have stopped him? I&rsquo;m not sure <em>I</em> could have,
even linked with Romanda and Lelaine.&rdquo; They were the next two
strongest women in the camp, as strong in the Power as Siuan used
to be.</p>

<p>Siuan visibly forced a scowl from her face, but even
so, she snorted. She often said that if she could no longer be
Amyrlin, then she would teach Egwene how to be the best Amyrlin
ever, yet the transition from lion on a hill to mouse underfoot was
difficult. Egwene allowed her no little latitude because of
that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want the two of you to ask about among those near
the tent Moghedien was sleeping in. Someone must have seen the man.
He had to come afoot. Anybody opening a gateway inside a space that
little risked cutting her in two, however small he wove it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Siuan snorted, louder than the first time. &ldquo;Why
bother?&rdquo; she growled. &ldquo;Do you mean to go chasing after like some
fool hero in a gleeman&rsquo;s fool story and bring her back? Maybe
tie up all the Forsaken at one go? Win the Last Battle while
you&rsquo;re at it? Even if we get a description head to toe, nobody
knows one Forsaken from another. Nobody here, anyway. It&rsquo;s the
most bloody useless barrel of fish guts I ever&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Siuan!&rdquo; Egwene said sharply, sitting up straighter.
Latitude was one thing, but there were limits. She did not put up
with this even from Romanda.</p>

<p>Color bloomed slowly in Siuan&rsquo;s cheeks.
Struggling to master herself, she kneaded her skirts and avoided
Egwene&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Forgive me, Mother,&rdquo; she said finally. She
almost sounded as if she meant it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has been a difficult day for her, Mother,&rdquo; Leane
put in with an impish smile. She was very good at those, though she
generally used them to set some man&rsquo;s heart racing. Not
promiscuously, of course; she possessed discrimination and
discretion in ample supply. &ldquo;But then, most are. If she could only
learn not to throw things at Gareth Bryne every time she gets angry&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; Egwene snapped. Leane was only trying to
take a little of the pressure from Siuan, but she was in no mood
for it. &ldquo;I want to know anything I can learn about whoever freed
Moghedien, even if it&rsquo;s just whether he was short or tall. Any
scrap that makes him less a shadow creeping in the dark. If
that&rsquo;s not more than I have a right to ask.&rdquo; Leane sat quite
still, staring at the flowers in the carpet in front of her
toes.</p>

<p>The redness spread to cover nearly Siuan&rsquo;s whole
face; with her fair skin, it made her look like a sunset. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;humbly beg your pardon, Mother.&rdquo; This time, she did sound penitent.
Her difficulty meeting Egwene&rsquo;s gaze was obvious. &ldquo;Sometimes
it&rsquo;s hard to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;No, no excuses. I humbly beg pardon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene fingered her stole, letting the moment set
itself as she looked at Siuan without blinking. That was something
Siuan herself had taught her, but after a bit she shifted uneasily
on the cot. When you knew you were in the wrong, silence pricked,
and the pricks drove home that you <em>were</em> wrong. Silence was
a very useful tool in a number of situations. &ldquo;Since I can&rsquo;t
recall what I should forgive,&rdquo; she said at last, quietly, &ldquo;there
seems to be no need. But, Siuan&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t let it happen
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mother.&rdquo; A hint of wry laughter curled
the corners of Siuan&rsquo;s mouth. &ldquo;If I may say so, I seem to have
taught you very well. But if I may suggest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; She waited for
Egwene&rsquo;s impatient nod. &ldquo;One of us should carry your order to
Faolain or Theodrin to ask the questions, very sulky at being made
a messenger. They&rsquo;ll occasion a deal less comment than Leane
or I. Everyone knows you are their patron.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene agreed immediately. She still was not thinking
clearly, or she would have seen that for herself. The headachy
feeling was back again. Chesa claimed it came from too little
sleep, but sleeping was difficult when your head felt taut as a
drumhead. It would take a larger head than hers not to feel tight,
stuffed with as many worries as she had. Well, at least now she
could pass on the secrets that had kept Moghedien hidden, how to
weave disguises with the Power and how to mask your ability from
other women who could channel. Revealing those had been too risky
when they might have led to unmasking Moghedien.</p>

<p><em>A bit more acclaim</em>, she thought wryly. There
had been great petting and exclaiming when she announced the
once-lost secret of Traveling, which at least had been her own, and
more praise since for every one of the secrets she had wrenched out
of Moghedien, like pulling a back tooth each time. None of the
acclaim made an ounce of difference in her position, though. You
could pat a talented child on the head without forgetting she was a
child.</p>

<p>Leane departed with a curtsy and a dry comment that
she was not sorry somebody else would have less than a full
night&rsquo;s rest for once. Siuan waited; no one could be allowed
to see her and Leane leaving together. For a time Egwene merely
studied the other woman. Neither spoke; Siuan seemed lost in
thought. Finally she gave a start and stood, straightening her
dress, plainly preparing to go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Siuan,&rdquo; Egwene began slowly, and found herself
uncertain how to continue.</p>

<p>Siuan thought she understood. &ldquo;You were not only
right, Mother,&rdquo; she said, looking Egwene straight in the eye, &ldquo;you
were lenient. Too lenient, though I say it who shouldn&rsquo;t. You
are the Amyrlin Seat, and <em>no one</em> may be insolent or
impertinent to you. If you&rsquo;d given me a penance that made even
Romanda feel sorry for me, it would have been no more than I
deserved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will remember that next time,&rdquo; Egwene said, and
Siuan bowed her head as if in acceptance. Maybe it was. Unless the
changes in her ran deeper than seemed possible, there almost
certainly would be a next time, and more after that. &ldquo;But what I
want to ask about is Lord Bryne.&rdquo; All expression vanished from
Siuan&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Are you sure you wouldn&rsquo;t like me to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;intervene?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why would I want that, Mother?&rdquo; Siuan&rsquo;s voice
was blander than cold water soup. &ldquo;The only duties I have are
teaching you the etiquette of your office and handing Sheriam
reports from my eyes-and-ears.&rdquo; She still retained some of her
former network, though it was doubtful any knew who their reports
went to now. &ldquo;Gareth Bryne hardly requires enough of my time to
interfere with that.&rdquo; She almost always referred to him that way,
and even when she used his title, she put a bite into it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Siuan, a burned barn and a few cows couldn&rsquo;t
cost that much.&rdquo; Not compared with paying and feeding all those
soldiers, certainly. But she had offered before, and the stiff
reply was the same.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you, Mother, but no. I won&rsquo;t have him
saying I break my word, and I swore to <em>work</em> the debt off.&rdquo;
Abruptly, Siuan&rsquo;s stiffness dissolved in laughter, rare when
she spoke about Lord Bryne. Scowls were much more common. &ldquo;If you
need to worry about somebody, worry about him, not me. I need no
help handling Gareth Bryne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And that was the strange part. Weak she might be in
the One Power, now, but not so weak that Siuan had to keep on as
his servant, spending hours up to her elbows in hot soapy water
with his shirts and smallclothes. Perhaps she did so in order to
have someone at hand on whom she could loose the temper she was
otherwise forced to keep in a sack. Whatever the reason, it
occasioned no little talk, and confirmed her oddness in many eyes;
she <em>was</em> Aes Sedai, after all, if rather far down. His
methods of dealing with her temper&mdash;once she threw plates and
boots, anyway&mdash;outraged her and provoked threats of dire
consequences, yet though she could have wrapped him up unable to
stir a finger, Siuan never touched <em>saidar</em> around him, not
to do his chores and not even when it meant being turned over his
knee. That fact she had kept hidden from most so far, but some
things slipped out when she was in a rage, or when Leane was in a
humor. There seemed to be no explanation. Siuan was not
weak-spirited or a fool, she was neither meek nor afraid, she was
not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might as well be on your way, Siuan.&rdquo; Clearly,
some secrets were not going to be revealed tonight. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
late, and I know you want your bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mother. And, thank you,&rdquo; she added, though
Egwene could not have said for what.</p>

<p>After Siuan left, Egwene rubbed her temples once
more. She wanted to pace. The tent would not do; it might be the
largest in the camp occupied by just one person, but that meant
less than two spans by two, and it was crowded with cot and chair
and stool, washstand and stand-mirror and no fewer than three
chests full of clothes. Chesa had seen to those last, and Sheriam,
and Romanda and Lelaine and a dozen more Sitters. They kept seeing
to them; a few more gifts of silk shifts or stockings, one more
dress grand enough to receive a king, and there would be need for a
fourth chest. Maybe Sheriam and the Sitters hoped all the fine
dresses would blind her to anything else, but Chesa just thought
the Amyrlin Seat had to be clothed suitably for her station.
Servants, it seemed, believed in following the correct rituals as
much as the Hall ever did. Shortly Selame would be there; it was
her turn to undress Egwene for bed, another ritual. Only, between
her head and her restless feet, she was not ready for bed yet.</p>

<p>Leaving the lamps burning, she hurried out before
Selame could arrive. Walking would clear her head, and maybe tire
her enough that she could sleep soundly. Putting herself to sleep
would be no problem&mdash;the Wise One dreamwalkers had taught her
that skill early on&mdash;yet finding any rest in it was another
matter. Especially when her mind boiled with a list of worries that
began with Romanda and Lelaine and Sheriam, then ran through Rand,
Elaida, Moghedien, the weather and on out of sight.</p>

<p>She avoided the area near Moghedien&rsquo;s tent. If
she asked questions herself, too much importance would be given to
a servant running away. Discretion had become part of her. The game
she played allowed few slips, and being careless where you knew it
did not matter could lead to being careless where it did. Worse,
you could discover you had been wrong about where it mattered. <em>The weak must be bold cautiously</em>. That was Siuan again; she
truly did her best to teach, and she knew this particular game very
well.</p>

<p>There were no more people out and about in the
moon-shadowed camp than had been there before, handfuls slouched
wearily around low fires, exhausted by their evening&rsquo;s labors
after a hard day&rsquo;s journey. Those who saw her rose tiredly to
make their courtesies as she passed, murmuring &ldquo;The Light shine on
you, Mother&rdquo; or something like, occasionally asking her blessing,
which she gave with a simple &ldquo;The Light bless you, my child.&rdquo; Men
and women old enough to be her grandparents sat back down beaming
from that, yet she wondered what they actually believed about her,
what they knew. All the Aes Sedai presented an unbroken front to
the outside world, including their own servants. But Siuan said
that if you believed a servant knew twice what he should, you only
knew half the truth. Still, those bows and curtsies and murmurs
followed her from one clump of people to the next, comforting her
with the possibility that there were some at least who did not see
her as a child the Hall brought out when they needed her.</p>

<p>As she passed an open area surrounded by ropes tied
to posts driven into the ground, a gateway&rsquo;s silver slash of
light flashed vivid in the darkness as it rotated open. It was not
really light, though; it cast no shadows. She paused to watch
beside a corner post. No one at the nearby fires even looked up;
they were used to this by now. A dozen or more sisters, twice as
many servants and a number of Warders bustled out, returning with
messages and wicker cages of pigeons from the dovecotes in Salidar,
a good five hundred miles west and south as the goose flew.</p>

<p>They began scattering before the gateway closed,
carrying their burdens to Sitters, to their Ajahs, a few back to
their own tents. Most nights, Siuan would have been with them; she
seldom trusted anyone else to fetch messages destined for her even
if most were in codes or ciphers. Sometimes the world seemed to
hold more networks of eyes-and-ears than it did Aes Sedai, though
most were severely truncated by circumstance. The majority of
agents for the various Ajahs seemed to be lying low until the &ldquo;difficulties&rdquo; in the White Tower subsided, and a good many of the
individual sisters&rsquo; eyes-and-ears had no idea where the woman
they served was at present.</p>

<p>Several of the Warders saw Egwene and made careful
bows, with a respect proper to the stole; sisters might eye her
askance, but the Hall had raised her Amyrlin and the Gaidin needed
no more. A number of the servants offered bows or curtsies too. Not
one of the Aes Sedai hurrying away from the gateway so much as
glanced in her direction. Perhaps they did not notice her.
Perhaps.</p>

<p>In a way, that anybody could still hear from any of
their eyes-and-ears at all was one of Moghedien&rsquo;s &ldquo;gifts.&rdquo; The
sisters with the strength to make gateways had all been in Salidar
long enough to know it well. Those who could weave a gateway of
useful size were able to Travel almost anywhere from there, and
land right on the spot. Trying to Travel <em>to</em> Salidar,
however, would have meant spending half of each night learning the
new roped-off patch of ground, more for some, every time they made
camp. What Egwene had pried from Moghedien was a way to journey
from a place you did not know well to one you did. Slower than
Traveling, Skimming was not one of the lost Talents&mdash;no one
had ever heard of it&mdash;so even the name was credited to
Egwene. Anyone who could Travel could Skim, so every night sisters
Skimmed to Salidar, checking the dovecotes for birds that had
returned to where they had been hatched, then Traveled back.</p>

<p>The sight should have pleased her&mdash;the rebel
Aes Sedai had gained Talents the White Tower thought lost forever,
as well as learned new ones, and those abilities would help cost
Elaida the Amyrlin Seat before all was done&mdash;yet instead of
pleasure, Egwene felt sourness. Being snubbed had nothing to do
with it, or not much, anyway. As she walked on, the fires grew
farther between, then faded behind; all around her lay the dark
shapes of wagons, most with canvas tops stretched over iron hoops,
and tents glowing palely in the moonlight. Beyond, the army&rsquo;s
campfires climbed the surrounding hills all around, the stars
brought to ground. The silence from Caemlyn tied her middle into
knots, whatever anyone else thought.</p>

<p>The very day they left Salidar a message had arrived,
though Sheriam had not bothered to show it to her until a few days
ago, and then with repeated warnings on the need to keep the
contents secret. The Hall knew, but no one else must. More of the
ten thousand secrets that infested the camp. Egwene was sure she
never would have seen it if she had not kept going on about Rand.
She could recall every carefully chosen word, written in a tiny
hand on paper so thin it was a wonder the pen had not torn
through.</p>

<p class="note">We are well settled at the inn of which we spoke, and
we have met with the wool merchant. He is a very
remarkable young man, everything that Nynaeve told us. Still, he
was courteous. I think he is somewhat afraid of us, which is to the
good. It will go well.</p>

<p class="note">You may have heard rumors about men here, including a
fellow from Saldaea. The rumors are all too true, I fear, but we
have seen none of them and will avoid them if we can. If you pursue
two hares, both will escape you.</p>

<p class="note">Verin and Alanna are here, with a number of young
women from the same region as the wool merchant. I will try to send
them on to you for training. Alanna has formed an attachment to the
wool merchant which may prove useful, though it is troubling too.
All will go well, I am sure.</p>

<p class="note_sig">Merana</p>

<p>Sheriam emphasized the good news, as she saw it.
Merana, an experienced negotiator, had reached Caemlyn and been
well received by Rand, the &ldquo;wool merchant.&rdquo; Wonderful news, to
Sheriam. And Verin and Alanna would be bringing Two Rivers girls to
become novices. Sheriam was sure they must be coming down the same
road they themselves were headed up. She seemed to think Egwene
would be all aglow at the expectation of seeing faces from home.
Merana would handle everything. Merana knew what she was doing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bucket of horse sweat,&rdquo; Egwene
muttered at the night. A gap-toothed fellow carrying a large wooden
bucket gave a start and gaped at her, so amazed he forgot to
bow.</p>

<p>Rand, <em>courteous</em>? She had seen his first
meeting with Coiren Saeldain, Elaida&rsquo;s emissary. &ldquo;Overbearing&rdquo;
summed it up nicely. Why should he be different with Merana? And
Merana thought he was afraid, thought that was good. Rand was
seldom afraid even when he should be, and if he was now, Merana
should remember that fear could make the mildest man dangerous,
remember that Rand was dangerous just being who he was. And what
was this attachment Alanna had formed? Egwene did not entirely
trust Alanna. The woman did extremely odd things at times, maybe
impetuously and maybe with some deeper motive. Egwene would not put
it past her to find a way into Rand&rsquo;s bed; he would be clay in
the hands of a woman like her. Elayne would break Alanna&rsquo;s
neck if that was so, but that was the least of it. Worst of all, no
more of the pigeons Merana had taken with her had appeared in the
Salidar dovecotes.</p>

<p>Merana should have had some word to send, if only
that she and the rest of the embassy had gone to Cairhien. Lately
the Wise Ones did little more than acknowledge Rand was alive, yet
it seemed he was there, sitting on his hands as far as she could
make out. Which should have been a warning beacon. Sheriam saw it
differently. Who could say why any man did what he did? Probably
not even the man himself, most of the time, and when it came to one
who could channel&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Silence proved all was well; Merana surely
would have reported any real difficulty. She must be on her way to
Cairhien, if not there already, and there was no need to report
further until she could send word of success. For that matter, Rand
in Cairhien was success of a sort. One of Merana&rsquo;s goals, if
not the most important, had been to ease him out of Caemlyn so that
Elayne could return there safely and take the Lion Throne, and the
dangers of Cairhien had dissipated. Incredible as it seemed, the
Wise Ones said Coiren and her embassy had left the city on their
way back to Tar Valon. Or maybe not so incredible. It all made a
sort of sense, given Rand, given the way Aes Sedai did things. Even
so, to Egwene, it all felt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;wrong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to go to him,&rdquo; she muttered. One hour, and
she could straighten everything out. Underneath, he was still Rand. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all there is to it. I have to go to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t possible, and you know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If Egwene had not had herself on a tight rein, she
would have jumped a foot. As it was, her heart pounded even after
she made out Leane by the light of the moon. &ldquo;I thought you were&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; she said before she could stop herself, and only just managed
not to say Moghedien&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p>The taller woman fell in beside her, keeping a
careful watch for other sisters as they walked. Leane did not have
Siuan&rsquo;s excuse for spending time with her. Not that being seen
together once should cause any harm, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Should not&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t always &ldquo;will not,&rdquo;</em>
Egwene reminded herself. Slipping the stole from her shoulders, she
folded it to carry in one hand. At a glance, from a distance, Leane
might well be taken for an Accepted despite her dress; many
Accepted lacked enough of the banded white dresses to wear one all
the time. From a distance, Egwene might be taken for one, too. Not
the most pacifying thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Theodrin and Faolain are asking around near
Marigan&rsquo;s tent, Mother. They weren&rsquo;t especially pleased.
I did a fine sulk over carrying messages, if I do say so. Theodrin
had to stop Faolain dressing me down for it.&rdquo; Leane&rsquo;s laughter
was quiet and breathy. Situations that grated Siuan&rsquo;s teeth
usually amused her. She was cosseted by most of the other sisters
for how well she had adjusted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good, good,&rdquo; Egwene said absently. &ldquo;Merana
misstepped somehow, Leane, or he wouldn&rsquo;t be staying in
Cairhien, and she wouldn&rsquo;t be keeping quiet.&rdquo; Off in the
distance, a dog bayed at the moon, then others, until they were
abruptly silenced by shouts that, perhaps luckily, she could not
quite understand. A number of the soldiers had dogs tagging along;
there were none in the Aes Sedai camp. Any number of cats, but no
dogs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Merana does know what she is doing, Mother.&rdquo; It
sounded very like a sigh. Leane and Siuan both agreed with Sheriam.
Everyone did, except her. &ldquo;When you give someone a task, you have
to trust it to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene sniffed and folded her arms. &ldquo;Leane, that man
could strike sparks from a damp cloth, if it wore the shawl. I
don&rsquo;t know Merana, but I&rsquo;ve never seen an Aes Sedai who
qualified as a damp cloth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve met one or two,&rdquo; Leane chuckled. This time
her sigh was plain. &ldquo;But not Merana, true. Does he really believe
he has friends inside the Tower? Alviarin? That might make him
difficult for Merana, I suppose, but I can hardly see Alviarin
doing anything to risk her place. She was always ambitious enough
for three.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has a letter supposedly from her.&rdquo; She could
still see Rand gloating over receiving letters from Elaida and
Alviarin both, back before she herself left Cairhien. &ldquo;Maybe her
ambitions make her think <em>she</em> can replace Elaida with him
on her side. That&rsquo;s if she really wrote it. He thinks
he&rsquo;s clever, Leane&mdash;maybe he is&mdash;but he
doesn&rsquo;t believe he needs anyone.&rdquo; Rand would go on thinking he
could handle anything by himself right up until one of those
anythings crushed him. &ldquo;I know him inside and out, Leane. Being
around the Wise Ones seems to have infected him, or maybe he
infected them. Whatever the Sitters think, whatever any of you
think, an Aes Sedai&rsquo;s shawl doesn&rsquo;t impress him any more
than it does the Wise Ones. Sooner or later he&rsquo;ll exasperate a
sister until she does something about it, or one of them will push
him the wrong way, not realizing how strong he is, and what his
temper is now. After that there might be no going back. I&rsquo;m
the only one who can deal with him safely. The only one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can hardly be as&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;irritating&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;as those
Aiel women,&rdquo; Leane murmured wryly. Even she found it difficult to
be amused by her experiences with the Wise Ones. &ldquo;But it hardly
matters. &lsquo;The Amyrlin Seat being valued with the White Tower
itself&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A pair of women appeared between the tents ahead,
moving slowly, as they talked. Distance and shadows obscured their
faces, yet it was clear they were Aes Sedai from the way they
carried themselves, an assurance that nothing hiding in any
darkness could harm them. No Accepted on the brink of the shawl
could manage quite that degree of confidence. A queen with an army
at her back might not. They were coming toward her and Leane. Leane
quickly turned in to the deeper dimness between two wagons.</p>

<p>Scowling with frustration, Egwene nearly pulled her
out again and marched on. Let it all come into the open. She would
stand before the Hall and tell them it was time they realized the
Amyrlin&rsquo;s stole was more than a pretty scarf. She would&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Following Leane, she motioned the other woman to walk on. What she
would not do was throw everything on the midden heap in a fit of
pique.</p>

<p>Only one Tower law specifically limited the power of
the Amyrlin Seat. A fistful of irritating customs and a barrel full
of inconvenient realities, but only one law, yet it could not have
been a worse for her purposes. &ldquo;The Amyrlin Seat being valued with
the White Tower itself, as the very heart of the White Tower, she
must not be endangered without dire necessity, therefore unless the
White Tower be at war by declaration of the Hall of the Tower, the
Amyrlin Seat shall seek the lesser consensus of the Hall of the
Tower before deliberately placing herself in the way of any danger,
and she shall abide by the consensus that stands.&rdquo; What rash
incident by an Amyrlin had inspired that, Egwene did not know, but
it had been law for something over two thousand years. To most Aes
Sedai, any law that old attained an aura of holiness; changing it
was unthinkable.</p>

<p>Romanda had quoted that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that <em>bloody</em>
law as though lecturing a half-wit. If the Daughter-Heir of Andor
could not be allowed within a hundred miles of the Dragon Reborn,
how much more they must preserve the Amyrlin Seat. Lelaine sounded
almost regretful, most likely because she was agreeing with
Romanda. That had nearly curdled both their tongues. Without them,
both of them, the lesser consensus lay as far out of reach as the
greater. Light, even that declaration of war only required the
lesser consensus! So if she could not obtain permission&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Leane cleared her throat. &ldquo;You can hardly do much if
you go in secret, Mother, and the Hall will find out, soon or late.
I think you would find it difficult to have an hour to yourself
after that. Not that they&rsquo;d dare put a guard on you,
precisely, but there are ways. I can quote examples from&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;certain sources.&rdquo; She never mentioned the hidden records directly
unless they were behind a ward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I so transparent?&rdquo; Egwene asked after a moment.
There were only wagons around them here, and beneath the wagons the
dark mounds of sleeping wagon drivers and horse handlers and all
the rest needed to keep so many vehicles moving. It was remarkable
just how many conveyances over three hundred Aes Sedai required,
when few would condescend to ride even a mile in wagon or cart. But
there were tents and furnishings and foodstuffs, and a thousand
things needed to keep the sisters and those who served them. The
loudest sounds here were snores, a chorus of frogs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Mother,&rdquo; Leane laughed softly. &ldquo;I just thought
what I would do. But it&rsquo;s well known I&rsquo;ve lost all my
dignity and sense; the Amyrlin Seat can hardly take me for a model.
I think you must let young Master al&rsquo;Thor go as he will, for a
time anyway, while you pluck the goose that&rsquo;s in front of
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His way may lead us all to the Pit of Doom,&rdquo; Egwene
muttered, but it was not an argument. There had to be a way to
pluck that goose and still keep Rand from making dangerous
mistakes, but she could not see it now. Not frogs; those snores
sounded like a hundred saws cutting logs full of knots. &ldquo;This is as
bad a spot for a soothing walk as I&rsquo;ve ever visited. I think I
might as well go to bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leane tilted her head. &ldquo;In that case, Mother, if you
will forgive me, there&rsquo;s a man in Lord Bryne&rsquo;s camp&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;After all, whoever heard of a Green without even one Warder?&rdquo; From
the sudden quickening in her voice, you might have thought she was
off to meet a lover. Considering what Egwene had heard about
Greens, perhaps there was not that much difference.</p>

<p>Back among the tents, the last of the fires had been
doused with dirt; no one took risks with fire when the countryside
was tinder dry. A few tendrils of smoke rose lazily in the
moonlight where the job had not been well done. A man murmured
drowsily in his sleep inside a tent, and here and there a cough
drifted out or a rasping snore, but otherwise the camp lay silent
and still. Which was why Egwene was surprised when someone stepped
from the shadows in front of her, especially someone wearing the
simple white dress of a novice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, I need to speak to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nicola?&rdquo; Egwene had made a point of fixing name to
face for every novice, no easy chore given how sisters hunted all
along the army&rsquo;s path for girls and young women who could
learn. Active search was still not well thought of&mdash;custom
was to wait for the girl to ask, best of all to wait for her to
come to the Tower&mdash;but ten times as many novices studied in
the camp now as the White Tower had held in years. Nicola was one
to be remembered, though, and besides, Egwene had often noticed the
young woman staring at her. &ldquo;Tiana won&rsquo;t be pleased if she
finds you up this late.&rdquo; Tiana Noselle was the Mistress of Novices,
known equally for a comforting shoulder when a novice needed to cry
and an unyielding stance when it came to rules.</p>

<p>The other woman shifted as if to hurry away, then
straightened her back. Sweat glistened on her cheeks. The darkness
was cooler than the light had been, but not what anyone would call
cool, and the simple trick of ignoring heat or cold came only with
the shawl. &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m supposed to ask to see Tiana Sedai and
then ask her to see you, Mother, but she&rsquo;d never let a novice
approach the Amyrlin Seat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About what, child?&rdquo; Egwene asked. The woman was
older by six or seven years at least, but that was the proper
address for a novice.</p>

<p>Fidgeting with her skirt, Nicola stepped closer.
Large eyes met Egwene&rsquo;s perhaps more directly than a
novice&rsquo;s should have. &ldquo;Mother, I want to go as far as I can.&rdquo;
Her hands plucked at her dress, but her voice was cool and
self-possessed, fit for an Aes Sedai. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say they are
holding me back, but I am sure I can become stronger than they say.
I just know I can. You were never held back, Mother. No one has
ever gained so much of her strength as fast as you. All I ask is
the same chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Movement in the shadow behind Nicola turned into
another sweaty-faced woman, this one in short coat and wide
trousers, carrying a bow. Her hair hung to her waist in a braid
tied with six ribbons, and she wore short boots with raised
heels.</p>

<p>Nicola Treehill and Areina Nermasiv seemed an odd
pair to be friends. Like many of the older novices&mdash;women
with nearly ten years on Egwene were tested now, though many
sisters still grumbled that they were ten years too old to accept
novice discipline&mdash;like many of those older women, Nicola was
ferocious in her desire to learn, by all reports, and she had a
potential bettered only by Nynaeve, Elayne and Egwene herself among
living Aes Sedai. In fact, Nicola apparently was making great
strides, often great enough that her teachers had to slow her down.
Some said she had begun picking up weaves as if she already knew
them. Not only that, but she already demonstrated two Talents,
although the ability to &ldquo;see&rdquo; <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> was minor,
while the major Talent, Foretelling, emerged so that no one
understood what she had Foretold. She herself did not remember a
word she said. All in all, Nicola was already marked by the sisters
as someone to watch despite her late start. The begrudging
agreement to test women older than seventeen or eighteen probably
could be laid at Nicola&rsquo;s feet.</p>

<p>Areina, on the other hand, was a Hunter for the Horn
who swaggered as much as a man and sat around talking of
adventures, those she had had and those she would, when she was not
practicing with her bow. Very likely she had picked that weapon up
from Birgitte, along with her manner of dress. She certainly seemed
to have no interest in anything beside the bow, except flirting
occasionally, in a rather forward manner, though not lately.
Perhaps long days on the road left her too tired for it, if not for
archery. Why she was still traveling with them, Egwene could not
understand; it was hardly likely that Areina believed the Horn of
Valere would turn up along their march, and impossible that she
even suspected it was hidden away inside the White Tower. <em>Very</em> few people knew that. Egwene was not certain even Elaida
did.</p>

<p>Areina seemed a posturing fool, but Egwene felt a
certain sympathy for Nicola. She understood the woman&rsquo;s
discontent, understood wanting to know it all now. She had been
that way, too. Maybe she still was. &ldquo;Nicola,&rdquo; she said gently, &ldquo;we
all have limits. I&rsquo;ll never match Nynaeve Sedai, for example,
whatever I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if I could only have the chance, Mother.&rdquo; Nicola
actually wrung her hands in pleading, and there was a touch of it
in her voice, yet her eyes still met Egwene&rsquo;s levelly. &ldquo;The
chance you had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I did&mdash;because I had no choice, because I
didn&rsquo;t know better&mdash;is called forcing, Nicola, and it is
dangerous.&rdquo; She had not heard that term until Siuan apologized for
doing it to her; that was one time Siuan truly had seemed
repentant. &ldquo;You know if you try to channel more of <em>saidar</em>
than you&rsquo;re ready to handle, you risk burning yourself out
before you ever come close to your full strength. Best you learn to
be patient. The sisters won&rsquo;t let you be anything else until
you are ready, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We came to Salidar on the same riverboat as Nynaeve
and Elayne,&rdquo; Areina said suddenly. Her gaze was more than direct;
it was challenging. &ldquo;And Birgitte.&rdquo; For some reason, she said the
name bitterly.</p>

<p>Nicola made shushing motions. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need
to bring that up.&rdquo; Oddly, she did not sound as if she meant it.</p>

<p>Hoping she was keeping her face half so smooth as
Nicola&rsquo;s, Egwene tried to quell a sudden uneasiness. &ldquo;Marigan&rdquo;
had come to Salidar on that boat, too. An owl hooted, and she
shivered. Some people thought hearing an owl in moonlight meant bad
news was coming. She was not superstitious, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;No need to
bring up what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other two women exchanged looks, and Areina
nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was on the walk from the river to the village.&rdquo;
For all her supposed reluctance, Nicola peered straight into
Egwene&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Areina and I heard Thom Merrilin and Juilin
Sandar talking. The gleeman, and the thief-taker? Juilin said if
there were Aes Sedai in the village&mdash;we weren&rsquo;t sure,
yet&mdash;and they learned Nynaeve and Elayne had been pretending
to be Aes Sedai, then we were all jumping into a school of
silverpike, which I take it isn&rsquo;t very safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gleeman saw us and hushed him,&rdquo; Areina put in,
fingering the quiver at her waist, &ldquo;but we heard.&rdquo; Her voice was
hard as her stare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know they&rsquo;re both Aes Sedai now, Mother, but
wouldn&rsquo;t they still be in trouble if anyone found out? The
sisters, I mean? Anybody who pretends to be a sister is in trouble
if they find out, even years later.&rdquo; Nicola&rsquo;s face did not
change, but her gaze suddenly seemed to be trying to fix
Egwene&rsquo;s. She leaned a little forward, intent. &ldquo;Anybody at
all. Isn&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emboldened by Egwene&rsquo;s silence, Areina grinned.
An unpleasant grin in the night. &ldquo;I hear Nynaeve and Elayne were
sent out of the Tower on some task by the Sanche woman back when
she was Amyrlin. I hear you were sent off by her, too, at the same
time. Got into all sorts of trouble when you came back.&rdquo; Sly
insinuation slithered into her voice. &ldquo;Do you remember them playing
at Aes Sedai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They stood there looking at her, Areina leaning
insolently on her bow, Nicola so expectant the air should have
crackled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Siuan Sanche is Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Egwene said coldly, &ldquo;and
so are Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara and Elayne Trakand. You will show them
proper respect. To you, they are Siuan Sedai, Nynaeve Sedai and
Elayne Sedai.&rdquo; The pair blinked in surprise. Inside, her stomach
quivered. With outrage. After everything she had been through
tonight, she was confronted with <em>blackmail</em> from these&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? She could not think of a word bad enough. Elayne could have;
Elayne listened to stablemen and wagon drivers and every sort,
memorizing the words she should have refused to hear. Unfolding the
striped stole, Egwene draped it carefully across her shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you understand, Mother,&rdquo; Nicola
said hastily. Not fearfully, however; just attempting to force her
point. &ldquo;I merely worried that if anyone found out that you had&mdash;&rdquo; Egwene gave her no chance to go further.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I understand, child.&rdquo; The fool woman <em>was</em> a child, however old she was. Any number of the older
novices gave trouble, usually in the form of insolence toward
Accepted set to teach them, but even the silliest had sense enough
to avoid impertinence to the sisters. It fanned her anger to white
heat, that the woman had the gall to try this on with her. They
were both taller than she, if not by much, but she planted her
fists on her hips and drew herself up, and they shrank away as
though she loomed. &ldquo;Do you have any notion how serious it is to
bring charges against a sister, especially for a novice? Charges
based on a conversation you claim to have heard between men now a
thousand miles away! Tiana would skin you alive and put you to
scrubbing pots the rest of your natural life.&rdquo; Nicola kept trying
to push a word in&mdash;apologies, they sounded like this time,
and more protests that Egwene did not understand, frantic attempts
to change everything&mdash;but Egwene ignored her and rounded on
Areina. The Hunter took another step back, wetting her lips and
looking remarkably uncertain. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t think you would
walk away clear, either. Even a Hunter could be hauled to Tiana for
a thing like this. If you&rsquo;re lucky enough not to be flogged at
a wagon tongue, the way they do soldiers caught stealing. Either
way, you&rsquo;ll be tossed out by the road with your welts for
company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drawing a deep breath, Egwene folded her hands at her
waist. Clutched together, they would not tremble. All but cowering,
the pair looked suitably chastened. She hoped those downcast eyes
and slumped shoulders and shifting feet were not feigned. By
rights, she should send them to Tiana right now. She had no idea
what the penalty might be for trying to blackmail the Amyrlin Seat,
but it seemed likely that being turned out of the camp would be the
least of it. In Nicola&rsquo;s case, the turning out would have to
wait until her teachers were satisfied she knew enough of
channeling not to hurt herself or others by accident. Nicola
Treehill would never be Aes Sedai, though, once that charge was
laid against her; all that potential would go for nothing.</p>

<p>Except&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Any woman caught pretending to be Aes
Sedai was set down so hard she would still be whimpering years
later, and an Accepted caught might very well consider the other
woman fortunate, but surely Nynaeve and Elayne were safe now they
really were sisters. Herself, as well. Only, it might take no more
than a whisper of this to erase any chance of making the Hall
acknowledge her truly the Amyrlin Seat. As well jaunt off to Rand,
and then tell the Hall to their faces. She dared not allow these
two to see her doubt, or even suspect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will forget this,&rdquo; she said sharply. &ldquo;But if I
hear so much as a whisper of it again, from anyone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She drew
a ragged breath&mdash;if she heard <em>shouts</em> of it, there
might be little she could do&mdash;but by the way they jumped,
they read a threat that pricked deep. &ldquo;Get to your beds before I
change my mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In an instant they became a flurry of curtsies, of &ldquo;Yes, Mother&rdquo; and &ldquo;No, Mother&rdquo; and &ldquo;As you command, Mother.&rdquo; They
scurried away looking back over their shoulders at her, every step
faster than the last, until they were running. She had to walk on
sedately, but she wanted to run too.</p>
