<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">S</span>elame
was waiting when Egwene got back to her tent,
a rail-thin woman with dark Tairen coloring and a nearly impervious
self-assurance. Chesa was right; she did carry her long nose
raised, as though recoiling from a bad smell. Yet if her manner
with the other maids was arrogant, she was in reality quite
different around her patroness. As Egwene entered, Selame folded
herself into a curtsy so deep her head nearly brushed the carpet,
skirts spread as wide as they would go in the cramped quarters.
Before Egwene had taken her second step inside, the woman leaped
up, fussing over her buttons. And fussing over her, too. Selame had
very little sense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mother, you went out with your head uncovered
again.&rdquo; As if she had ever worn any of those beaded caps the woman
favored, or the embroidered velvet things Meri favored, or
Chesa&rsquo;s plumed hats. &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re shivering. You should
never go walking out-of-doors without a shawl and parasol, Mother.&rdquo;
How was a parasol supposed to stop shivering? With sweat trickling
down her own cheeks however fast she dabbed with her handkerchief,
Selame never thought to ask why she shivered, which was perhaps
just as well. &ldquo;And you went alone, in the night. It just isn&rsquo;t
proper, Mother. Besides, there are all those soldiers, rough men,
with no decent respect for any woman, even Aes Sedai. Mother, you
simply mustn&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene let the foolish words wash over her in the
same way she let the woman undress her, paying less than half a
mind. Ordering her to be quiet would only produce so many hurt
looks and abused sighs that it made little difference. Except for
the brainless chatter, Selame performed her duties diligently, if
with so many flourishes they became a dance of grand gestures and
obsequious curtsies. It seemed impossible that anyone could be as
silly as Selame, always concerned with appearances, always worrying
over what people would think. To her, people were Aes Sedai and the
nobility, and their upper servants. By her book, no one else
mattered; perhaps no one else thought, by her book. It probably
<em>was</em> impossible. Egwene was not about to forget who had
found Selame in the first place, any more than she did who had
found Meri. True, Chesa was a gift from Sheriam, but Chesa had
shown her loyalties to Egwene more than once.</p>

<p>Egwene wanted to tell herself the tremors that the
other woman took for shivers were quivers of rage, yet she knew a
worm of fear writhed in her belly. She had come too far, had too
much to do yet, to allow Nicola and Areina to put a spoke through
her wheels.</p>

<p>As her head popped through the top of a clean shift,
she caught a bit of the skinny woman&rsquo;s prattle and stared. &ldquo;Did you say ewe&rsquo;s milk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Mother. Your skin is so soft, and nothing
will keep it that way like bathing in ewe&rsquo;s milk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maybe she really was an idiot. Hustling a protesting
Selame out, Egwene brushed her own hair, turned down her own cot,
placed the now useless <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> bracelet in the small
carved ivory box where she kept her few pieces of jewelry, then
extinguished the lamps. <em>All by myself</em>, she thought
sarcastically in the darkness. <em>Selame and Meri will have
conniptions</em>.</p>

<p>Before retiring, however, she padded to the entrance
and opened a small gap in the doorflaps. Outside was moonlit
stillness and silence, broken by a night heron&rsquo;s cry that
suddenly cut off in a shriek. There were hunters abroad in the
darkness. After a moment something moved in the shadows beside a
tent across the way. It looked like a woman.</p>

<p>Perhaps idiocy did not disqualify Selame any more
than dour-faced gloom eliminated Meri. It could be either one. Or
someone else entirely. Even Nicola or Areina, however unlikely. She
let the tentflap fall shut with a smile. Whoever the watcher was
would not see where she went tonight.</p>

<p>The way the Wise Ones had taught her to put herself
to sleep was simple. Eyes closed, feeling each part of the body
relax in turn, breathing in time with her heartbeat, mind unfocused
and drifting, all but one tiny corner, drifting. Sleep swept over
her in moments, but it was the sleep of a dreamwalker.</p>

<p>Formless, she floated deep within an ocean of stars,
infinite points of light glimmering in an infinite sea of darkness,
fireflies beyond counting flickering in an endless night. Those
were dreams, the dreams of everyone sleeping anywhere in the world,
maybe of everyone in all possible worlds, and this was the gap
between reality and <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, the space
separating the waking world from the World of Dreams. Wherever she
looked ten thousand fireflies vanished as people woke, and ten
thousand new were born to replace them. A vast ever-changing array
of sparkling beauty.</p>

<p>She did not waste time in admiration, though. This
place held dangers, some deadly. She was sure she knew how to avoid
those, but one peril in this place aimed straight at her if she
lingered too long, and being caught in it would be embarrassing to
say the least. Keeping a wary eye out&mdash;well, it would have
been a wary eye had she had eyes here&mdash;she moved. She had no
sense of motion. It seemed she stood still and that glittering
ocean swirled around her until one light settled before her. Every
twinkling star looked exactly like every other, yet she knew this
was Nynaeve&rsquo;s dream. <em>How</em> she knew was another matter;
not even the Wise Ones understood that recognition.</p>

<p>She had considered trying to find Nicola&rsquo;s
dreams, and Areina&rsquo;s. Once she unearthed them, she knew
exactly how to sink the fear of the Light into their bones, and she
did not give a fig that every bit of it was proscribed.
Practicality sent her here instead, not fear of the forbidden. She
had done what was not done before, and she was certain she would
again should it become necessary. Do what you must, then pay the
price for it, was what she had been taught, by the same women who
had marked off those forbidden areas. It was refusal to admit the
debt, refusal to pay, that often turned necessity to evil. But even
if that pair were asleep, locating someone&rsquo;s dreams the first
time was arduous at best, without guarantees. Days of efforts&mdash;nights of it, rather&mdash;were more likely to deliver
nothing. This was at least sure.</p>

<p>Slowly she moved closer through everlasting darkness,
though once again it seemed that she stayed still and the pinpoint
of light grew, to a glowing pearl, an iridescent apple, a full
moon, until it filled her vision entirely with brightness, all the
world. She did not touch it, though, not yet. A space finer than a
hair remained between. Ever so gently, she reached across that gap.
With what, lacking a body, was as much a mystery as how she knew
one dream from another. Her will, the Wise Ones said, but she still
did not understand how that could be. As though laying a finger to
a soap bubble, she kept her touch very delicate indeed. The shining
wall shimmered like spun glass, pulsed like a heart, delicate and
alive. A little firmer touch, and she would be able to &ldquo;see&rdquo;
inside, &ldquo;see&rdquo; what Nynaeve was dreaming. A bit firmer still, and
she could actually step inside and be a part of the dream. That
carried hazards, especially with anyone of a strong mind, but
either looking in or stepping in could be mortifying. For example,
if the dreamer happened to be dreaming of a man she was
particularly interested in. Apologies alone took half the night
when you did that. Or, with a hooking sort of motion, like rolling
a fragile bead across a tabletop, she could snatch Nynaeve out,
into a dream of her own making, a part of <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> itself, where she was in complete
control. She was sure that would work. Of course, that was one of
the forbidden things, and she did not think Nynaeve would
appreciate it.</p>

<p>NYNAEVE, THIS IS EGWENE. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES ARE
YOU TO RETURN UNTIL YOU FIND THE BOWL, NOT UNTIL I CAN SETTLE A
PROBLEM WITH AREINA AND NICOLA. THEY KNOW YOU WERE PRETENDING. I
WILL EXPLAIN MORE WHEN I SEE YOU NEXT IN THE LITTLE TOWER. BE
CAREFUL. MOGHEDIEN HAS ESCAPED.</p>

<p>The dream winked out, the soap bubble pricked.
Despite the message, she would have giggled had she possessed a
throat. A disembodied voice in your dream could have a startling
effect. Especially if you were afraid the speaker might be peeking.
Nynaeve was not one to forget even when it was an accident.</p>

<p>That light-spangled sea whirled about her once more
until she settled on another sparkling pinpoint. Elayne. The two
women very likely slept no more than a dozen paces apart in Ebou
Dar, but distance had no meaning here. Or perhaps it had a
different meaning.</p>

<p>This time when she delivered her message, the dream
pulsed and changed. It still appeared exactly the same as every
other, but even so, to her it was transformed. Had the words drawn
Elayne into another dream? They would remain, however, and she
would remember on waking.</p>

<p>With Nicola and Areina&rsquo;s bowstrings dampened a
little more, it was time to turn her attention to Rand.
Unfortunately, finding his dreams would be as useless as finding an
Aes Sedai&rsquo;s. He shielded his somewhat as they did theirs,
although apparently a man&rsquo;s shield differed from a
woman&rsquo;s. An Aes Sedai&rsquo;s shield was a crystal carapace, a
seamless sphere woven of Spirit, but however transparent it
appeared, it might as well have been steel. She could not recall
how many fruitless hours she had frittered away trying to peer
through his. Where a sister&rsquo;s shielded dream seemed brighter,
close up, his were dimmer. It was like staring into muddy water;
sometimes you had the impression that something had moved deep in
those gray-brown swirls, but you could never tell what.</p>

<p>Again the endless array of lights spun and settled,
and she approached a third woman&rsquo;s dream. Gingerly. So much
lay between her and Amys that it seemed akin to approaching her
mother&rsquo;s dreams. In truth, she had to admit, she wanted to
emulate Amys in many ways. She desired Amys&rsquo; respect every bit
as greatly as she did the Hall&rsquo;s. Maybe, if she had to choose,
she would choose Amys&rsquo;. Certainly, there was no Sitter she
esteemed as highly as she did Amys. Pushing away a sudden
diffidence, she tried to make her &ldquo;voice&rdquo; softer, to no avail.</p>

<p>AMYS, THIS IS EGWENE. I MUST SPEAK WITH
YOU.</p>

<p><em>We will come</em>, a voice murmured to her.
Amys&rsquo; voice.</p>

<p>Startled, Egwene backed away. She felt like laughing
at herself. Perhaps it was just as well to be reminded that the
Wise Ones had long years&rsquo; more experience at this. There were
times she was afraid she might have been spoiled by not having to
work harder for her abilities with the One Power. Then again, as if
to make up for it, sometimes everything else seemed like trying to
climb a cliff in a rainstorm.</p>

<p>Abruptly she caught movement at the very edge of her
field of vision. One of those points of light slid through the sea
of stars, drifting toward her of its own volition, growing larger.
Only one dream would do that, one dreamer. In a panic, she fled,
wishing she had a throat to scream, or curse, or just shout.
Especially at the tiny corner of her that wanted to stay where she
was and wait.</p>

<p>Not even the stars moved this time. They simply
disappeared, and she was leaning against a thick redstone column,
panting as though she had sprinted a mile, heart beating fit to
burst. After a moment, she looked down at herself and began to
laugh a trifle unsteadily, trying to catch her breath. She had on a
full-skirted gown of shimmering green silk, worked in
thread-of-gold in wide, ornate bands across the bodice and along
the hem. That bodice also showed <em>considerably</em> more bosom
than she ever would waking, and a broad cinched belt of woven gold
made her waist seem smaller than it really was. Then again, maybe
it was smaller. Here in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, you
could be however you wanted, whatever you wanted. Even when the
wanting was unconscious, if you were not careful. Gawyn Trakand had
unfortunate effects on her, very unfortunate.</p>

<p>That tiny part of her still wished she had waited to
be overtaken by his dream. Overtaken and absorbed by it. If a
dreamwalker loved somebody to distraction, or hated them beyond
reason, most especially if the emotion was returned, she could be
pulled into that person&rsquo;s dream; she drew the dream, or it
drew her, as a lodestone drew iron filings. She certainly did not
hate Gawyn, but she could not afford to be trapped in his dream,
not tonight, trapped until he wakened, being as he saw her. Which
was a good deal more beautiful than she truly was; oddly, <em>he</em> appeared less beautiful than he was in life. There was no
question of a strong mind or concentration when love or hate that
strong was involved. Once you were in that dream, there you
remained until the other person stopped dreaming about you.
Remembering what he dreamed of doing with her, what they had done
in his dreams, she felt a fiery blush suffusing her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good thing none of the Sitters can see me now,&rdquo;
she muttered. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d never take me for anything but a girl,
then.&rdquo; Grown women did not flutter and moon over a man this way;
she was certain of that. Not women with any sense, anyway. What he
dreamed of would come, but at a time of her choosing. Obtaining her
mother&rsquo;s permission might be difficult, yet surely she would
not withhold it even if she had never laid eyes on Gawyn. Marin
al&rsquo;Vere trusted her daughters&rsquo; judgment. Now it was time
for her youngest daughter to show a little of that judgment and put
these fancies away until a better time.</p>

<p>Looking around, she almost wished she could go on
letting Gawyn fill her thoughts. More massive columns ran in every
direction, supporting a soaring, vaulted ceiling and a great dome.
None of the gilded lamps hanging from golden chains overhead was
lit, yet there was light of a sort, light that was just there,
without source, neither bright nor dim. The Heart of the Stone,
inside the great fortress called the Stone of Tear. Or rather its
image in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, an image as real as the
original in many ways. This was where she had met the Wise Ones
before, their choice. A strange one for Aiel, it seemed to her. She
would have expected Rhuidean, now that it was open, or somewhere
else in the Aiel Waste, or simply wherever the Wise Ones happened
to be. Every place except Ogier <em>stedding</em> had its
reflection in the World of Dreams&mdash;even the <em>stedding</em>
did, really; but they could not be entered, just as Rhuidean had
once been closed. The Aes Sedai camp was out of the question, of
course. A number of the sisters now had access to <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> that allowed them to enter the World of
Dreams, and since none really knew what they were doing, they often
began their ventures by appearing in the camp of <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> as though setting out on a normal
journey.</p>

<p>Like <em>angreal</em> and <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>,
by Tower law <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> were the property of the
White Tower, no matter who happened to possess them for the
present. Very seldom did the Tower insist, at least when possession
lay somewhere like the so-called Great Holding in this very Stone
of Tear&mdash;eventually they would come to the Aes Sedai, and the
White Tower had always been good at waiting when it needed to&mdash;but those actually in Aes Sedai hands were in the gift of
the Hall, of individual Sitters. The loan, really; they were almost
never given. Elayne had learned to duplicate dream <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, and she and Nynaeve had taken two with them,
but the rest were in the Hall&rsquo;s possession now, along with the
other sorts Elayne had made. Which meant that Sheriam and her
little circle could use them whenever they wished, and most
assuredly Lelaine and Romanda, though it was likely those two sent
others instead of entering <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>
themselves. Until quite recently, no Aes Sedai had walked the dream
in centuries, and they still had considerable difficulties, most of
which stemmed from a belief that they could learn by themselves.
Even so, the last thing Egwene wanted was any of their followers
spying on this meeting tonight.</p>

<p>As though the thought of spies had made her more
sensitive, she became aware of being watched by unseen eyes. That
sensation was always present in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>,
and not even the Wise Ones knew why, but although hidden eyes
always seemed to be there, actual watchers might be present as
well. It was not Romanda or Lelaine on her mind, now.</p>

<p>Trailing her hand against the column, she walked all
the way around it slowly, studying the redstone forest as it ran
away in deepening shadows. The light surrounding her was not real;
anybody in one of those shadows would see the same light around
them while shadows hid her. People did appear, men and women,
flickering images that rarely lasted more than a few heartbeats.
She had no interest in those who touched the World of Dreams in
their sleep; anyone might do that by happenstance, but luckily for
them, only for moments, seldom long enough to face any of the
dangers. The Black Ajah possessed dream <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>,
too, stolen from the Tower. Worse, Moghedien knew <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> as well as any dreamwalker. Perhaps
better. She could control this place and anyone in it as easily as
turning her hand.</p>

<p>For a moment Egwene wished she had spied on
Moghedien&rsquo;s dreams while the woman was prisoner, just once,
just enough to be able to distinguish them. But even identifying
her dreams would not reveal where she was now. And there had been
the possibility of being drawn in against her will. She certainly
despised Moghedien enough, and the Forsaken most assuredly hated
her without bounds. What happened in there was not real, not even
as real as in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, but you remembered
it as if it was. A night in Moghedien&rsquo;s power would have been
a nightmare she likely would have relived every time she went to
sleep for the rest of her life. Maybe awake, too.</p>

<p>Another circuit. What was that? A dark, regally
beautiful woman in pearl-covered cap and lace-ruffed gown strode
from the shadows and vanished. A Tairen woman dreaming, a High Lady
or dreaming herself as one. She might be plain and dumpy, a
farmwife or a merchant, awake.</p>

<p>Better to have spied on Logain than Moghedien. She
still would not know where he was, but she might have some idea of
his plans. Of course, being pulled into his dream might not have
been much more pleasant than being drawn into Moghedien&rsquo;s. He
hated all Aes Sedai. Arranging his escape had been one of those
necessary things; she just hoped the price would not be too high.
Forget Logain. Moghedien was the danger, Moghedien who might come
after her, even here, especially here, Moghedien who&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Suddenly she became aware of how heavily she was
moving, and made a vexed sound in her throat, very nearly a groan.
The beautiful gown had become a full set of plate-and-mail armor
like that of Gareth Bryne&rsquo;s heavy cavalry. An open-faced
helmet rested on her head, with a crest in the shape of the Flame
of Tar Valon, by the feel. It was very irritating. She was beyond
this sort of lack of control.</p>

<p>Firmly she changed the armor to what she had worn
meeting the Wise Ones before. It was just a matter of thought. Full
skirt of dark wool and loose white <em>algode</em> blouse, just as
she had worn while studying with them, complete with a fringed
shawl so green it was nearly black and a folded head scarf to hold
her hair back. She did not duplicate their jewelry, of course, all
the multitudes of necklaces and bracelets. They would laugh at her
for that. A woman built her collection over the years, not in the
blink of a dream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Logain is on his way to the Black Tower,&rdquo; she said
aloud; she certainly hoped he was; at least there would be some
check on him then, or so she hoped, and if he was caught and
gentled again, Rand could not blame any sister following her, &ldquo;and
Moghedien has no way of knowing where I am.&rdquo; That, she tried to
make sound a certainty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should you fear the Shadowsouled?&rdquo; asked a voice
behind her, and Egwene tried to climb into the air. This being <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, and she a dream walker, she was more
than her own height above the floorstones before she came to
herself. <em>Oh, yes</em>, she thought, floating, <em>I&rsquo;m far
beyond all those beginner&rsquo;s mistakes</em>. If this went on,
next she would be jumping when Chesa gave her good morning.</p>

<p>Hoping she was not blushing too badly, she let
herself settle slowly; perhaps she could retain a little
dignity.</p>

<p>Perhaps, yet Bair&rsquo;s aged face had more creases
than usual from a grin that seemed nearly to touch her ears. Unlike
the other two women with her, she could not channel, but that had
nothing to do with dreamwalking. She was as skilled as either, more
in some areas. Amys was smiling too, if not so broadly, but
sun-haired Melaine threw back her head and roared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never seen anyone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Melaine just managed
to get out. &ldquo;Like a rabbit.&rdquo; She gave a little hop and lifted a
full pace into the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I recently caused Moghedien some hurt.&rdquo; Egwene was
quite proud of her poise. She liked Melaine&mdash;the woman was
much less thorny since she was with child; with twins, actually&mdash;but at the moment Egwene could have strangled her
cheerfully. &ldquo;Some friends and I damaged her pride, if not much
more. I think she would like the opportunity to repay me.&rdquo; On
impulse, she changed her clothes once more, to the sort of riding
dress she wore every day now, in lustrous green silk. The Great
Serpent encircled her finger with gold. She could not tell them
everything, but these women were friends too, and they deserved to
know what she could tell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wounds to the pride are remembered long after wounds
to the flesh.&rdquo; Bair&rsquo;s voice was thin and high, yet strong, a
reed of iron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell us about it,&rdquo; Melaine said, with an eager smile. &ldquo;How did you shame her?&rdquo; Bair&rsquo;s was just as enthusiastic. In a
cruel land, you either learned to laugh at cruelty or spent your
life weeping; in the Three-fold Land, the Aiel had learned to laugh
long since. Besides, shaming an enemy was considered an art.</p>

<p>Amys studied Egwene&rsquo;s new clothes for a moment,
then, said, &ldquo;That can come later, I think. We are to talk, you
said.&rdquo; She gestured to where the Wise Ones liked to talk, out
beneath the vast dome at the heart of the chamber.</p>

<p>Why they chose that spot was another mystery Egwene
could not puzzle out. The three women settled themselves
cross-legged, spreading their skirts neatly, only a few paces from
what seemed to be a sword made of gleaming crystal, rising
hilt-first from where it had been driven into the floor-stones.
They paid it no mind whatsoever&mdash;it was no part of their
prophecies&mdash;any more than they did the people who flashed
into existence around the great chamber, but here was always where
they came.</p>

<p>Fabled <em>Callandor</em> would indeed function as a
sword despite its appearance, but in truth it was a male <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>, one of the most powerful ever made in the Age
of Legends. She felt a little shiver, thinking of male <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>. It had been different when there was only
Rand. And the Forsaken, of course. But now there were these
Asha&rsquo;man. With <em>Callandor</em>, a man could draw enough of
the One Power to level a city in a heartbeat and devastate
everything for miles. She walked wide around it, holding her skirts
aside reflexively. From the Heart of the Stone Rand had drawn <em>Callandor</em> in fulfillment of the Prophecies, then returned it
for his own reasons. Returned it, and snared it round with traps
woven in <em>saidin</em>. They would have their reflection, too,
one that might trigger as decisively as the original should the
wrong weaves be tried nearby. Some things in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> were all too real.</p>

<p>Trying not to think of the Sword That Is Not a Sword,
Egwene placed herself before the three Wise Ones. Fastening their
shawls around their waists, they unlaced their blouses. That was
how Aiel women sat with friends, in their tents beneath a hot sun.
She did not sit, and if that made her seem a supplicant or on
trial, so be it. In a way, in her heart, she was. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not
told you why I was summoned away from you, and you have not
asked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will tell us when you are ready,&rdquo; Amys said
complacently. She looked of an age with Melaine despite hair white
as Bair&rsquo;s tumbling to her waist&mdash;her hair had begun
turning when she was little older than Egwene&mdash;but she was
the leader among the three, not Bair. For the first time, Egwene
wondered just how old she was. Not a question you asked a Wise One,
any more than an Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I left you, I was one of the Accepted. You know
about the division in the White Tower.&rdquo; Bair shook her head and
grimaced; she knew, but she did not understand. None of them did.
To Aiel, it was as unreal as clan or warrior society dividing
against itself. Perhaps it was also affirmation in their eyes that
Aes Sedai were less than they should be. Egwene went on, surprised
that her voice was collected, steady. &ldquo;The sisters who oppose
Elaida have raised me as their Amyrlin. When Elaida is pulled down,
I will sit on the Amyrlin Seat, in the White Tower.&rdquo; She added the
striped stole to her clothes and waited. Once she had lied to them,
a serious transgression under <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>, and she
was not sure how they would react to learning this truth she had
hidden. If only they believed, at least. They merely looked at
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a thing children do,&rdquo; Melaine said
carefully after a time. Her pregnancy did not show yet, but already
she had the inner radiance, making her even more beautiful than
usual, and an inward, unshakable calm. &ldquo;Children all want to push
spears, and they all want to be the clan chief, but eventually they
realize that the clan chief seldom dances the spears himself. So
they make a figure and set it on a rise.&rdquo; Off to one side the floor
suddenly mounded up, no longer stone tiles but a ridge of sun-baked
brown rock. Atop it stood a shape vaguely like a man, made of
twisted twigs and bits of cloth. &ldquo;This is the clan chief who
commands them to dance the spears from the hill where he can see
the battle. But the children run where they will, and their clan
chief is only a figure of sticks and rags.&rdquo; A wind whipped the
cloth strips, emphasizing the hollowness of the shape, and then
ridge and figure were gone.</p>

<p>Egwene drew a deep breath. Of course. She had atoned
for her lie according to <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>, by her own
choice, and that meant it was as if the lie had never been spoken.
She should have known better. But they had struck to the heart of
her situation as though they had been weeks in the Aes Sedai camp.
Bair studied the floor, not wanting to witness her shame. Amys sat
with chin in hand, sharp blue gaze trying to dig to her heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some see me so.&rdquo; Another deep breath, and she pushed
the truth out. &ldquo;All but a handful do. Now. By the time we finish
our battle, they will know I <em>am</em> their chief, and they will
run as <em>I</em> say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Return to us,&rdquo; Bair said. &ldquo;You have too much honor
for these women. Sorilea already has a dozen young men picked out
for you to view in the sweat tents. She has a great desire to see
you make a bridal wreath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope she will be there when I wed, Bair&rdquo;&mdash;to
Gawyn, she hoped; that she would bond him, she knew from
interpreting her dreams, but only hope and the certainty of love
said they would wed&mdash;&ldquo;I hope all of you will, but I&rsquo;ve
made my choice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bair would have argued further, and Melaine too, but
Amys raised a hand, and they fell silent, if not pleased. &ldquo;There is
much <em>ji</em> in her decision. She will bend her enemies to her
will, not run from them. I wish you well in your dance, Egwene
al&rsquo;Vere.&rdquo; She had been a Maiden of the Spear, and often
thought as one still. &ldquo;Sit. Sit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her honor is her own,&rdquo; Bair said, frowning at Amys, &ldquo;but I have another question.&rdquo; Her eyes were an almost watery blue,
yet when they turned on Egwene, they were sharp as ever Amys&rsquo;
had been. &ldquo;Will you bring these Aes Sedai to kneel to the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Startled, Egwene nearly fell the last foot to the
floor-stones rather than sitting. There was no hesitation in her
answer, though. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that, Bair. And would not if I
could. Our loyalty is to the Tower, to the Aes Sedai as a whole,
above even the lands we were born in.&rdquo; That was true, or was
supposed to be, though she wondered how the claim squared in their
minds with her and the others&rsquo; rebellion. &ldquo;Aes Sedai
don&rsquo;t even swear fealty to the Amyrlin, and certainly not to
any man. That would be like one of you kneeling to a clan chief.&rdquo;
She made an illustration the way Melaine had, by concentrating on
its reality; <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> was infinitely
malleable if you knew how. Beyond <em>Callandor</em> three Wise
Ones dropped to their knees before a clan chief. The man strongly
resembled Rhuarc, the women the three in front of her. She only
held it for an instant, but Bair glanced at it and sniffed loudly.
The notion <em>was</em> preposterous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not compare those women to us.&rdquo; Melaine&rsquo;s
green eyes sparkled with something very like their old sharpness;
her tone was honed like a razor.</p>

<p>Egwene held her tongue. The Wise Ones seemed to
despise Aes Sedai, all except her, or perhaps better to say they
were contemptuous. She thought they might actually resent the
prophecies that linked them to Aes Sedai. Before she had been
summoned by the Hall to be raised Amyrlin, Sheriam and her circle
of friends had met here regularly with these three, but that had
ended as much because the Wise Ones refused to hide their contempt
as because Egwene finally had been called. In <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, a confrontation with someone more
familiar with the place could be mortifying in the extreme. Even
with Egwene, there was a distance now, and certain matters they
would not discuss, such as whatever they knew of Rand&rsquo;s plans.
Before, she had been one with them, a student in dreamwalking;
after, she was Aes Sedai, even before they learned what she had
just told them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egwene al&rsquo;Vere will do as she must,&rdquo; Amys said.
Melaine gave her a long look and rearranged her shawl
ostentatiously, shifted several long necklaces in a clatter of
ivory and gold, but said nothing. Amys seemed even more the leader
than she had been. The only Wise One Egwene had ever seen make
other Wise Ones defer to her so easily was Sorilea.</p>

<p>Bair had imagined tea before her, as it might be in
the tents, a golden teapot worked with lions from one country, a
silver tray edged in ropework from another, tiny green cups of
delicate Sea Folk porcelain. The tea tasted real, of course, felt
real going down. Despite a hint of some sweet berry or herb she did
not recognize, it was too bitter for Egwene&rsquo;s tongue. She
imagined a little honey in it and took another sip. Too sweet. A
touch less honey. Now it tasted right. That was something you could
not do with the Power. Egwene doubted that anyone had the skill to
weave threads of <em>saidar</em> fine enough to remove honey from
tea.</p>

<p>For a moment she sat peering into her teacup,
thinking about honey and tea and fine threads of <em>saidar</em>,
but that was not what held her silent. The Wise Ones wanted to
guide Rand no less than Elaida or Romanda or Lelaine, or very
likely any other Aes Sedai. Of course, they only wanted to direct
the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> in a way that was best for the
Aiel, yet those sisters wanted to direct the Dragon Reborn toward
what was best for the world, as they saw it. She did not spare
herself. Helping Rand, keeping him from putting himself at odds
with Aes Sedai beyond recovery, those meant guiding him, too. <em>Only,
I&rsquo;m right</em>, she reminded herself. <em>Whatever I do is as much
for his own good as for anybody else&rsquo;s. None of the others
ever think about what&rsquo;s right for him</em>. But it was best to
remember that these women were more than simply her friends and
followers of the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>. No one was ever
simply anything, she was learning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think you wished only to tell us you are
now a woman chief among the wetlanders,&rdquo; Amys said over her teacup. &ldquo;What troubles your mind, Egwene al&rsquo;Vere?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What troubles me is what always does.&rdquo; She smiled to
lighten the mood. &ldquo;Sometimes I think Rand is going to give me gray
hairs before my time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without men, no woman would have gray hairs.&rdquo;
Normally, that would have been a joke on Melaine&rsquo;s tongue, and
Bair would have made another over the vast knowledge of men Melaine
had gained in just a few months of marriage, but not this time. All
three women simply watched Egwene and waited.</p>

<p>So. They wished to be serious. Well, Rand was serious
business. She just wished she could be sure they saw it anything at
all the way she did. Balancing her cup on her fingertips, she told
them everything. About Rand, anyway, and her fears since learning
of the silence from Caemlyn. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s done&mdash;or what she has; everybody tells me how experienced Merana
is, but she&rsquo;s had none with the likes of him. When it comes to
Aes Sedai, if you hid this cup in a meadow, he&rsquo;d still manage
to step on it inside three paces. I know I could do better than
Merana, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could return,&rdquo; Bair suggested again, and Egwene
shook her head firmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can do more where I am, as Amyrlin. And there are
rules even for the Amyrlin Seat.&rdquo; Her mouth twisted for an instant.
She did not like admitting that, especially not to these women. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t even visit him without the Hall&rsquo;s permission.
I&rsquo;m Aes Sedai now, and I have to obey our laws.&rdquo; That came out
more fiercely than she intended. It was a stupid law, but she had
not yet found a way around it. Besides, they wore so little
expression she was sure they were snickering incredulously inside.
Not even a clan chief had the right to say when or where a Wise One
could go.</p>

<p>The three women across from her exchanged long looks.
Then Amys set her teacup down and said, &ldquo;Merana Ambrey and other
Aes Sedai followed the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> to the
treekillers&rsquo; city. You need have no fear he will put his foot
wrong with her, or any of your sisters with her. We will see that
there is no difficulty between him and any Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That hardly sounds like Rand,&rdquo; Egwene said
doubtfully. So Sheriam had been right about Merana. But why was she
still silent?</p>

<p>Bair cackled with laughter. &ldquo;Most parents have more
trouble with their children than lies between the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> and the women who came with Merana
Ambrey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So long as he isn&rsquo;t the child,&rdquo; Egwene
chuckled, relieved that someone was amused at something. The way
these women felt about Aes Sedai, they would have been spitting
nails if they thought any sister was gaining influence with him. On
the other hand, Merana had to gain some, or she might as well leave
now. &ldquo;But Merana should have sent a report. I don&rsquo;t understand
why she hasn&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;re certain there isn&rsquo;t any&mdash;?&rdquo; She could not think of how to finish. There was no way
that Rand could have stopped Merana from sending off a pigeon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she sent a man on a horse.&rdquo; Amys grimaced
faintly; as much as any Aiel, she found riding repugnant. Your own
legs were good enough. &ldquo;She brought none of the birds that
wetlanders use.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was foolish of her,&rdquo; Egwene muttered. Foolish
did not come close. Merana&rsquo;s dreams would be shielded, so
there was no point trying to talk to her there. Even if they could
be found. Light, but it was vexing! She leaned forward intently. &ldquo;Amys, promise me you won&rsquo;t try to stop him from talking with
her, or make her so angry she does something foolish.&rdquo; They were
quite capable of that; more than capable. They had putting an Aes
Sedai&rsquo;s back up perfected to a Talent. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s just
supposed to convince him that we mean him no harm. I&rsquo;m sure
Elaida has some nasty surprise hidden behind her skirts, but we
don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; She would see to that, if anyone had different
notions. Somehow, she would. &ldquo;Promise me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They passed unreadable looks back and forth. They
could not like the idea of letting a sister near Rand, certainly
not unhindered. Doubtless one of them would contrive to be present
whenever Merana was, but she could live with that so long as they
did not hinder too much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promise, Egwene al&rsquo;Vere,&rdquo; Amys said finally,
in a voice flat as worked stone.</p>

<p>Probably she was offended that Egwene had required a
pledge, but Egwene felt as though a weight had lifted. Two weights.
Rand and Merana were not at each other&rsquo;s throats, and Merana
would have a chance to do what she had been sent to do. &ldquo;I knew
I&rsquo;d have the unvarnished truth from you, Amys. I can&rsquo;t
tell you how glad I am to hear it. If anything were wrong between
Rand and Merana&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Startled, she blinked. For an instant, Amys wore <em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em>. She made some sort of small gesture, too.
Maiden handtalk, perhaps. Neither Bair nor Melaine, sipping their
tea, gave any sign that they had noticed. Amys must have been
wishing she were somewhere else, away from the tangle Rand had made
of everybody&rsquo;s life. It would be embarrassing, shaming, for a
Wise One dreamwalker to lose control of herself in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> even for an instant. To the Aiel,
shame hurt far worse than pain, but it had to be witnessed to <em>be</em> shame. If it was not seen, or those who saw refused to
admit it, then it might as well never have happened. A strange
people, but she certainly did not want to shame Amys. Composing her
face, she went on as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must ask a favor. An important favor. Don&rsquo;t
tell Rand&mdash;or anybody&mdash;about me. About this, I mean to
say.&rdquo; She lifted an end of her stole. Their faces made an Aes
Sedai&rsquo;s best calm look maniacal. Stone was not in it. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t mean lie,&rdquo; she added hastily. Under <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>, asking someone to lie was little better
than telling one yourself. &ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t bring it up. He&rsquo;s
already sent somebody to &lsquo;rescue&rsquo; me.&rdquo; <em>And won&rsquo;t
he be furious when he finds out I shuffled Mat off to Ebou Dar with
Nynaeve and Elayne</em>, she thought. She had had to do it, though. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need rescuing, and I don&rsquo;t want it, but he
thinks he knows better than everybody. I&rsquo;m afraid he might
come hunting for me himself.&rdquo; Which frightened her more&mdash;that
he might appear in the camp alone, raging, with three hundred or so
Aes Sedai around him? Or that he might come with some of the
Asha&rsquo;man? Either way, a disaster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;unfortunate,&rdquo; Melaine murmured,
though she was seldom one for understatement, and Bair muttered, &ldquo;The <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> is headstrong. As bad as any man
I have ever known. And a few women, for that matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will hold your confidence close, Egwene
al&rsquo;Vere,&rdquo; Amys said gravely.</p>

<p>Egwene blinked at the quick agreement. But perhaps it
was not so surprising. To them, the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>
was only another chief, just more so, and Wise Ones had certainly
been known to keep things from a chief they thought he should not
know.</p>

<p>After that there was not much to say, though they
talked a while longer over more cups of tea. She longed for a
lesson in walking the dream, but could not ask with Amys there.
Amys would go, and she wanted her company more than learning. The
closest the Wise Ones came to telling her anything Rand was
actually doing was when Melaine grumbled that he should finish the
Shaido and Sevanna now, and both Bair and Amys frowned at her so,
she turned bright red. After all, Sevanna was a Wise One, as Egwene
knew quite bitterly. Not even the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>
would be allowed to interfere with even a Shaido Wise One. And she
could not give them details of her own circumstances. That they had
leaped right to the most shaming part did nothing to lessen the
shame she would feel talking about it&mdash;it was very hard not
to drop back into behaving, even thinking, as the Aiel did when she
was around them; for that matter, she thought it might have shamed
her had she never met an Aiel&mdash;and the only sort of advice
they had about dealing with Aes Sedai lately was of a nature that
Elaida herself would not try to follow. An Aes Sedai riot, unlikely
as it sounded, might result. Worse, they already thought badly
enough of Aes Sedai without her adding wood to the fire. Some day
she wanted to forge a link between the Wise Ones and the White
Tower, but that would never happen unless she managed to dampen
that fire down. Another thing she had no idea how to do, as
yet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; she said at last, standing. Her body lay
asleep in her tent, but there was never quite enough rest in sleep
while you were in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. The others
rose with her. &ldquo;I hope you will all be very careful. Moghedien
hates me, and she would certainly try to hurt anyone who&rsquo;s my
friend. She knows a great deal about the World of Dreams. At least
as much as Lanfear did.&rdquo; That was as close as she could come to
warning them without saying right out that Moghedien might know
more than they. Aiel pride could be prickly. They took her meaning,
though, and without offense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the Shadowsouled meant to threaten us,&rdquo; Melaine
said, &ldquo;I think they would have by now. Perhaps they believe we are
no threat to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have glimpsed those who must be dreamwalkers,
including men.&rdquo; Bair shook her head incredulously; no matter what
she knew about the Forsaken, she considered male dreamwalkers about
as common as legs on snakes. &ldquo;They avoid us. All of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we are as strong as they,&rdquo; Amys added. In
the One Power, she and Melaine were no stronger than Theodrin and
Faolain&mdash;far from weak, indeed stronger than most Aes Sedai,
but far from a Forsaken&rsquo;s strength, too&mdash;yet in the
World of Dreams, knowledge of <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> was
often as powerful as <em>saidar</em>, more at times. Here, Bair was
the equal of any sister. &ldquo;But we will take care. It is the enemy
you underestimate who kills you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene took Amys&rsquo; hand and Melaine&rsquo;s, and
would have Bair&rsquo;s had there been a way. Instead, she included
her with a smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never be able to tell you what your
friendship means to me, what you mean to me.&rdquo; Despite everything,
that was simple truth. &ldquo;The whole world seems to be changing every
time I blink. You three are one of the few firm spots in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The world does change,&rdquo; Amys said, sadly. &ldquo;Even
mountains are worn away by the wind, and no one can climb the same
hill twice. I hope we will always be friends in your eyes, Egwene
al&rsquo;Vere. May you always find water and shade.&rdquo; And with that,
they were gone, back to their own bodies.</p>

<p>For a time she stood frowning at <em>Callandor</em>
but not seeing it, until suddenly she gave herself an exasperated
shake. She had been thinking about that endless field of stars. If
she waited there long, Gawyn&rsquo;s dream would find her again,
swallow her the way his arms would shortly thereafter. A pleasant
way to spend the rest of the night. And a childish waste of
time.</p>

<p>Firmly she made herself step back to her sleeping
body, but not to ordinary sleep. She never did that anymore. That
one corner of her brain remained fully aware, cataloging her
dreams, filing away those that foretold the future, or at any rate
gave glimpses of the possible course it might take. At least she
could tell that much now, though the only one she had been able to
interpret so far was the dream that told of Gawyn becoming her
Warder. Aes Sedai called this Dreaming, and the women who could do
it Dreamers, all long dead but her, yet it had no more to do with
the One Power than dreamwalking did.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was inevitable she should dream first of
Gawyn, because she had been thinking of him.</p>

<p>She stood in a vast, dim chamber where everything was
indistinct. Everything except Gawyn, slowly coming toward her. A
tall, beautiful man&mdash;had she ever thought his half-brother
Galad was more beautiful?&mdash;with golden hair and eyes of the
most wonderful deep blue. He had some distance to cover yet, but he
could see her; his gaze was fixed on her like an archer&rsquo;s on
the target. A faint sound of crunching and grating hung in the air.
She looked down. And felt a scream building in her. On bare feet,
Gawyn walked across a floor of broken glass, shards breaking at
every slow step. Even in that faint light she could see the trail
of blood left by his slashed feet. She flung out a hand, tried to
shout for him to stop, tried to run to him, but just that quickly
she was elsewhere.</p>

<p>In the way of dreams she floated above a long,
straight road across a grassy plain, looking down upon a man riding
a black stallion. Gawyn. Then she was standing in the road in front
of him, and he reined in. Not because he saw her, this time, but
the road that had been straight now forked right where she stood,
running over tall hills so no one could see what lay beyond. She
knew, though. Down one fork was his violent death, down the other,
a long life and a death in bed. On one path, he would marry her, on
the other, not. She knew what lay ahead, but not which way led to
which. Suddenly he did see her, or seemed to, and smiled, and
turned his horse along one of the forks&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;And she was in
another dream. And another. Another. And again.</p>

<p>Not all had any bearing on the future. Dreams of
kissing Gawyn, of running in a cool spring meadow with her sisters
the way they had as children, slid by along with nightmares where
Aes Sedai with switches chased her through endless corridors, where
misshapen things lurched through shadows all around, where a
grinning Nicola denounced her to the Hall and Thom Merrilin came
forward to give evidence. Those she discarded; the others she
tucked away, to be prodded and poked later in the hope she might
understand what they meant.</p>

<p>She stood before an immense wall, clawing at it,
trying to tear it down with her bare hands. It was not made of
brick or stone, but countless thousands of discs, each half white
and half black, the ancient symbol of the Aes Sedai, like the seven
seals that had once held the Dark One&rsquo;s prison shut. Some of
those seals were broken now, though not even the One Power could
break <em>cuendillar</em>, and the rest had weakened somehow, but
the wall stood strong however she beat at it. She could not tear it
down. Maybe it was the symbol that was important. Maybe it was the
Aes Sedai she was trying to tear down, the White Tower. Maybe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mat sat on a night-shrouded hilltop, watching a grand
Illuminator&rsquo;s display of fireworks, and suddenly his hand shot
up, seized one of those bursting lights in the sky. Arrows of fire
flashed from his clenched fist, and a sense of dread filled her.
Men would die because of this. The world would change. But the
world <em>was</em> changing; it always changed.</p>

<p>Straps at waist and shoulder held her tightly to the
block, and the headsman&rsquo;s axe descended, but she knew that
somewhere someone was running, and if they ran fast enough, the axe
would stop. If not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;In that corner of her mind, she felt a
chill.</p>

<p>Logain, laughing, stepped across something on the
ground and mounted a black stone; when she looked down, she thought
it was Rand&rsquo;s body he had stepped over, laid out on a funeral
bier with his hands crossed at his breast, but when she touched his
face, it broke apart like a paper puppet.</p>

<p>A golden hawk stretched out its wing and touched her,
and she and the hawk were tied together somehow; all she knew was
that the hawk was female. A man lay dying in a narrow bed, and it
was important he not die, yet outside a funeral pyre was being
built, and voices raised songs of joy and sadness. A dark young man
held an object in his hand that shone so brightly she could not see
what it was.</p>

<p>On and on they came, and she sorted feverishly,
desperately tried to understand. There was no rest in it, but it
must be done. She would do what must be done.</p>
