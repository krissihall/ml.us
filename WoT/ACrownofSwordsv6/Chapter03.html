<h4><em>Hill of the Golden Dawn</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">O</span>n
a wide low hilltop some miles north and east of
the city of Cairhien, well away from any road or human habitation,
a thin vertical slash of pure light appeared, taller than a man on
a horse. The ground sloped away in every direction, undulating
gently; nothing more than occasional brush obscured the view for
more than a mile, all the way to the surrounding forest. Brown
grass fell as the light seemed to rotate, widening into a square
opening in midair. A number of the dead stems were slit lengthwise,
sliced finer than any razor could have. By a hole in the air.</p>

<p>The instant the gateway was fully open, veiled Aiel
poured out, men and Maidens, spreading in every direction to
encircle the hill. Almost hidden in the torrent, four sharp-eyed
Asha&rsquo;man took up positions around the gateway itself, peering
toward the encircling woodland. Nothing stirred except with the
wind, dust, tall grass and branches in the distance, yet each
Asha&rsquo;man studied the vista with the fervor of a starving hawk
searching for a rabbit. A rabbit watching for a hawk might have
been as intent, but never with that air of menace.</p>

<p>There was really no break in the flow. One moment it
was a flood of Aiel, the next, mounted Cairhienin armsmen galloping
out two by two, the crimson Banner of Light going up at their head
as soon as it cleared the gateway. Without a pause Dobraine drew
his men aside and began forming them up a little down the slope,
helmeted and gauntleted in precise ranks, lances raised to the same
angle. Seasoned campaigners, they were ready to wheel and charge in
any direction at his gesture.</p>

<p>On the heels of the last Cairhienin, Perrin rode
Stepper through, the dun passing in one stride from the hill below
Dumai&rsquo;s Wells to the hill in Cairhien, and ducked in spite of
himself. The upper edge of the thing stood well above his head, but
he had seen the damage a gateway could do and had no wish to test
whether they were safer standing still. Loial and Aram followed
close behind&mdash;the Ogier, afoot with his long-hafted axe on
his shoulder, bent his knees&mdash;and then the Two Rivers men,
crouching on their saddles well beyond the gateway. Rad al&rsquo;Dai
carried the Red Wolfhead banner, Perrin&rsquo;s because everyone
said it was, and Tell Lewin the Red Eagle.</p>

<p>Perrin tried not to look at those, especially the Red
Eagle. The Two Rivers men wanted things both ways. He was a lord,
so he had to have banners. He was a lord, but when he told them to
get rid of those bloody banners, they never vanished for long. The
Red Wolfhead named him something he was not and did not want to be,
while the Red Eagle&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;More than two thousand years after
Manetheren died in the Trolloc Wars, close to a thousand after
Andor swallowed part of what once had been Manetheren, that banner
was still as good as an act of rebellion for an Andorman. Legends
still walked in some men&rsquo;s minds. Of course it had been a few
generations since Two Rivers folk had had any notion that they were
Andormen, but Queens&rsquo; minds did not change so easily.</p>

<p>He had met the new Queen of Andor what seemed a long
time ago, in the Stone of Tear. She had not been Queen then&mdash;and was not yet, really, until she was crowned in Caemlyn&mdash;but Elayne seemed a pleasant young woman, and pretty, though he was
not partial to fair-haired women. A bit taken with herself, of
course, as Daughter-Heir. Taken with Rand, too, if snuggling in
corners meant anything. Rand meant to give her not only the Lion
Throne of Andor, but the Sun Throne of Cairhien. Surely she would
be grateful enough to let the flying of a flag pass when it did not
really mean anything. Watching the Two Rivers men deploy behind
those banners, Perrin shook his head. It was a worry for another
day, in any case.</p>

<p>There was nothing like armsmen&rsquo;s precision in
the Two Rivers men, most boys like Tod, farmers&rsquo; sons and
shepherds, yet they knew what to do. Every fifth man took the reins
of four more horses while the other riders hurriedly dismounted,
longbows already strung and in hand. Those on the ground straggled
together in rough lines, looking around with more interest than
anything else, but they checked their quivers with practiced
gestures and handled their bows with familiarity, the great Two
Rivers bows, even when strung nearly as tall as the men who drew
them. With those bows, not a man of them but could shoot farther
than anyone outside the Two Rivers would believe. And hit what he
aimed at.</p>

<p>Perrin hoped there would be none of that today.
Sometimes he dreamed of a world where there never was. And Rand&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Do you believe my enemies have been asleep while
I was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;away?&rdquo; Rand had said suddenly as they stood waiting for
Dashiva to open the gateway. He had on a coat rooted out of the
wagons, well-cut green wool, but hardly what he usually wore now.
Short of taking the coat off a Warder&rsquo;s back or a</em>
cadin&rsquo;sor <em>from an Aielman, it was the only garment in the
camp to fit him. Truth, you would have thought he insisted on silk
and fine embroidery, the way he had had those wagons searched top
to bottom, yesterday and this morning.</em></p>

<p><em>The wagons stretched out in line, teams hitched,
canvas covers and iron hoops taken down. Kiruna and the rest of the
sworn sisters sat packed into the lead wagon, and not happy. They
had ceased their protests as soon as they saw that protesting did
no good, but Perrin could still hear coldly angry mutters. At least
they rode. Their Warders surrounded the wagon afoot, silent and
stony, while the Aes Sedai prisoners stood in a rigid, sullen
cluster ringed by every Wise One who was not with Rand, which was
to say all but Sorilea and Amys. The prisoners&rsquo; Warders
glowered in another clump a hundred paces off, cold death waiting
despite their injuries and</em> siswai&rsquo;aman <em>guards. Except
for Kiruna&rsquo;s big black, its reins held by Rand, and a
mouse-colored mare with fine ankles for Min, the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s
and Warders&rsquo; horses not assigned to Asha&rsquo;man&mdash;or
used to fill out wagon teams; </em>that<em> had caused a commotion worse
than making their owners walk!&mdash;were all tied to long lead
lines fastened to the wagons&rsquo; tailgates.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Do you believe it, Flinn? Grady?&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>One of the Asha&rsquo;man waiting to go through
first, the stocky fellow with a farmer&rsquo;s face, looked at Rand
uncertainly, then at the leathery old man with the limp. Each wore
a silver sword pin on his collar, but not the Dragon. &ldquo;Only a fool
thinks his enemies stand still when he isn&rsquo;t looking, my Lord
Dragon,&rdquo; the old man said in a gruff voice. He sounded like a
soldier.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>What about you, Dashiva?&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>Dashiva gave a start, surprised to be addressed. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;grew up on a farm.&rdquo; He tugged his sword belt straight,
which it did not need. Supposedly they trained with the swords as
much as with the Power, but Dashiva did not seem to know one end
from the other. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much about having enemies.&rdquo;
Despite his awkwardness, there was a kind of insolence to him. But
then, the whole lot seemed weaned on arrogance.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>If you stay near me,&rdquo; Rand said softly, &ldquo;you
will.&rdquo; His smile made Perrin shiver. He smiled while he gave orders
to go through the gateway as though they would be attacked on the
other side. There were enemies everywhere, he told them. Always
remember that. There were enemies everywhere, and you never knew
who.</em></p>

<p>The exodus continued unabated. Wagons rumbled from
Dumai&rsquo;s Wells to Cairhien, the sisters in the first like
statues of ice being lurched about. Their Warders trotted
alongside, hands gripping sword hilts and eyes never resting on one
spot; clearly they thought their Aes Sedai needed protection as
much from those already on the hill as from anyone who might
appear. The Wise Ones marched through herding their charges; a
number used sticks to prod the Aes Sedai along, though the sisters
made a good job pretending there were neither Wise Ones nor prods.
The Shaido <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> came, trotting in a column four
wide under the gaze of a single Maiden; she pointed to a place out
of the way before darting to join the other <em>Far Dareis
Mai</em>, and the <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> knelt there in lines,
naked as jaybirds and proud as eagles. The remaining Warders
followed under their guard, radiating a massed fury that Perrin
could smell over everything else, then Rhuarc with the rest of the
<em>siswai&rsquo;aman</em> and Maidens, and four more Asha&rsquo;man,
each leading a second horse for one of the first four, and Nurelle
and his Winged Guards with their red-streamered lances.</p>

<p>The Mayeners were puffed up over being the rear
guard, laughing and shouting boasts to the Cairhienin of what they
would have done had the Shaido returned, though in fact they were
not last. Last of all came Rand on Kiruna&rsquo;s gelding, and Min
on her mare. Sorilea and Amys strode along to one side of the tall
black horse, Nandera and half a dozen Maidens to the other, and
Dashiva led a placid-looking bay mare at their heels. The gateway
winked out, and Dashiva blinked at where it had been, smiling
faintly, then scrambled clumsily into the mare&rsquo;s saddle. He
seemed to be talking to himself, but it was probably because his
sword tangled in his legs and he nearly fell. Surely he was not mad
already.</p>

<p>An army covered the hill, all arrayed for an attack
that plainly was not coming. A small army, only a few thousand,
though it would have seemed fair-sized before the Aiel brought
their numbers across the Dragonwall. Guiding his horse slowly
toward Perrin, Rand scanned the countryside. The two Wise Ones
followed closely, talking softly and watching him; Nandera and the
Maidens followed, watching everything else. Had Rand been a wolf,
Perrin would have said he was testing the air. He carried the
Dragon Scepter across his high saddlebow, a two-foot length of
spearhead decorated with a green-and-white tassel and carved with
Dragons, and now and then he weighed it lightly in his hand as if
to remind himself of it.</p>

<p>When Rand reined in, he studied Perrin as intently as
he had the surrounding country. &ldquo;I trust you,&rdquo; he said finally,
nodding. Min stirred in her saddle, and he added, &ldquo;And you, Min, of
course. And you, too, Loial.&rdquo; The Ogier shifted uncertainly, with a
hesitant glance for Perrin. Rand looked around the hillside, at the
Aiel and the Asha&rsquo;man and all the rest. &ldquo;So few I can trust,&rdquo;
he whispered tiredly. His scent was jumbled enough for two men,
anger and fear, determination and despair. And woven through it
all, weariness.</p>

<p><em>Be sane</em>, Perrin wanted to tell him. <em>Hold
on</em>. A wash of guilt held his tongue, though. Because it was
the Dragon Reborn he wanted to say it to, not his friend since
childhood. He wanted his friend to stay sane; the Dragon Reborn
<em>had</em> to stay sane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord Dragon,&rdquo; one of the Asha&rsquo;man called
abruptly. He looked little more than a boy, with dark eyes as big
as any girl&rsquo;s and neither sword nor Dragon on his collar, but
pride in his bearing. Narishma, Perrin had heard him called. &ldquo;To
the southwest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A figure had appeared, running out from the trees a
mile or more away, a woman with skirts hiked to her thighs. To
Perrin&rsquo;s eyes she was clearly Aiel. A Wise One, he thought,
though there was no real way to tell at sight. He was just certain.
The sight of her brought back all his edginess. Somebody out here,
just where they happened to come out of the gateway, could not be
good news. The Shaido had been troubling Cairhien again when he set
off after Rand, but to the Aiel, a Wise One was a Wise One,
whatever her clan. They visited like neighbors over for tea while
their clans killed one another. Two Aiel trying to kill each other
would step back to let a Wise One pass between. Maybe yesterday had
changed that and maybe not. He exhaled wearily. At best she could
not be good news.</p>

<p>Nearly everyone on the hill seemed to feel the same.
Ripples of motion ran everywhere, spears hefted, arrows nocked.
Cairhienin and Mayeners shifted in their saddles, and Aram drew his
sword, eyes shining with anticipation. Loial leaned on his tall axe
and fingered the edge regretfully. The head was shaped like that of
a huge wood-axe, but engraved with leaves and scrolls and inlaid
with gold. The inlay was a trifle scuffed from the axe&rsquo;s late
use. If he had to use it again, he would, but with as much
reluctance as Perrin used his and for many of the same reasons.</p>

<p>Rand simply sat his horse and watched, face
unreadable. Min edged her mare close enough to stroke his shoulder
like someone trying to soothe a mastiff with its hackles up.</p>

<p>The Wise Ones also gave no sign of disturbance, but
neither did they stay still. Sorilea gestured, and a dozen of the
women guarding the Aes Sedai broke off to join her and Amys, well
away from Rand and out of even Perrin&rsquo;s hearing. Few had any
gray in their hair, and Sorilea&rsquo;s was the only lined face, but
then, there was hardly a gray hair to be seen on any of the Wise
Ones here. The fact was, not many Aiel lived to have much gray
hair. These women had position, though, or influence, however Wise
Ones decided such things. Perrin had seen Sorilea and Amys confer
with the same lot before, though confer was not quite the word.
Sorilea spoke, with an occasional word from Amys, and the others
listened. Edarra raised a protest, but Sorilea smothered it,
apparently without breaking stride, then pointed out two of their
number, Sotarin and Cosain. Immediately, they gathered their skirts
over their arms and sped off toward the newcomer, legs
flashing.</p>

<p>Perrin patted Stepper&rsquo;s neck. No more killing.
Not yet.</p>

<p>The three Wise Ones met nearly half a mile from the
hill and stopped. They spoke, just for a moment, and then all came
on at a run, back to the hill. And straight to Sorilea. The
newcomer, a youngish, long-nosed woman with a mass of incredibly
red hair, spoke hurriedly. Sorilea&rsquo;s face grew stonier by the
word. Finally the red-haired woman finished&mdash;or rather
Sorilea cut her short with a few words&mdash;and the lot turned to
face Rand. None made a move toward him, though. They waited, hands
folded at their waists and shawls looped over their arms,
inscrutable as any Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>,&rdquo; Rand muttered
dryly under his breath. Swinging a leg over, he slid from his
saddle, then helped Min to the ground.</p>

<p>Perrin climbed down too, and led Stepper after them
to the Wise Ones. Loial trailed along, and Aram followed on his
horse, not dismounting until Perrin motioned him to. Aiel did not
ride, not unless it was absolutely necessary anyway, and they
considered it rude for anyone to face them from horseback. Rhuarc
joined them, and Gaul, who wore a scowl for some reason. It went
without saying that Nandera and Sulin and the Maidens came too.</p>

<p>The red-haired newcomer began as soon as Rand drew
near. &ldquo;Bair and Megana set watches every way you might possibly
come back to the treekillers&rsquo; city, <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>, but in truth, no one thought this would
be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Feraighin,&rdquo; Sorilea said, sharply enough to draw
blood. The red-haired woman&rsquo;s teeth clicked as she snapped her
mouth shut, and she stared fixedly at Rand with brilliant blue
eyes, avoiding Sorilea&rsquo;s glare.</p>

<p>Finally Sorilea took a breath and turned her
attention to Rand. &ldquo;There is trouble in the tents,&rdquo; she said in a
flat voice. &ldquo;Rumors began among the treekillers that you have gone
to the White Tower with the Aes Sedai who came, gone to bend knee
to the Amyrlin Seat. None who know the truth dared speak, or the
result would have been worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is the result?&rdquo; Rand asked quietly. He
exuded tension, and Min began stroking his shoulder again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many believe you have abandoned the Aiel,&rdquo; Amys told
him just as quietly. &ldquo;The bleakness has returned. Every day a
thousand or more throw down their spears and vanish, unable to face
our future, or our past. Some may be going to the Shaido.&rdquo; For a
moment disgust tinged her voice. &ldquo;There have been whispers that the
true <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> would not give himself to the
Aes Sedai. Indirian says if you have gone to the White Tower, it
cannot be willingly. He is ready to take the Codarra north, to Tar
Valon, and dance the spears with any Aes Sedai he finds. Or any
wetlander; he says you mast have been betrayed. Timolan mutters
that if the tales are true, you have betrayed us, and he will take
the Miagoma back to the Three-fold Land. After he sees you dead.
Mandelain and Janwin hold their counsel, but they listen to
Indirian and Timolan both.&rdquo; Rhuarc grimaced, sucking air between
his teeth; for an Aiel, that was as much as tearing his hair in
despair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not good news,&rdquo; Perrin protested, &ldquo;but you
make it sound a death sentence. Once Rand shows himself, the rumors
are done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand scrubbed a hand through his hair. &ldquo;If that was
so, Sorilea wouldn&rsquo;t look like she had swallowed a lizard.&rdquo;
For that matter, Nandera and Sulin looked as though their lizards
were still alive on the way down. &ldquo;What haven&rsquo;t you told me
yet, Sorilea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The leather-faced woman gave him a thin, approving
smile. &ldquo;You see beyond what is said. Good.&rdquo; Her tone stayed flat as
worked stone, though. &ldquo;You return with Aes Sedai. Some will believe
that means you did bend knee. Whatever you say or do, they will
believe you wear an Aes Sedai halter. And that is before it is
known you were a prisoner. Secrets find crevices a flea could not
slip through, and a secret known by so many has wings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin eyed Dobraine and Nurelle, watching with their
men, and swallowed queasily. How many of those who followed Rand
did so because he had the weight of the Aiel massed behind him? Not
all, certainly, but for every man who had chosen because Rand was
the Dragon Reborn, five or even ten had come because the Light
shone brightest on the strongest ranks. If the Aiel broke away, or
splintered&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He did not want to think about that possibility.
Defending the Two Rivers had stretched his abilities as far as they
would go, maybe farther. <em>Ta&rsquo;veren</em> or not, he had no
illusions he was one of those men who ended up in the histories;
that was for Rand. Village-sized problems were his limit. Yet he
could not help himself. His mind churned. What to do if the worst
came? Lists ran up in his head: who would remain loyal and who
might try to slip away. The first list was sufficiently short and
the second sufficiently long to dry his throat. Too many people
still schemed for advantage as if they had never heard of the
Prophecies of the Dragon or the Last Battle. He suspected some
still would the day after Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don began. The worst of
it was, most would not be Darkfriends, just people looking out for
their own interests first. Loial&rsquo;s ears hung limp; he saw it,
too.</p>

<p>No sooner did Sorilea finish speaking to Rand than
her eyes whipped to one side in a glare to bore holes in iron. &ldquo;You
were told to remain in the wagon.&rdquo; Bera and Kiruna came to an
abrupt halt, and Alanna nearly stumbled into them. &ldquo;You were told
not to touch the One Power without permission, but you listened to
what was said here. You will learn that I mean what I say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite Sorilea&rsquo;s auguring stare, the three held
their ground, Bera and Kiruna with icy dignity, Alanna with
smoldering defiance. Loial&rsquo;s huge eyes rolled toward them,
then toward the Wise One; if his ears had been limp before, now
they wilted completely, and his long eyebrows dropped to his
cheeks. Poring uneasily over his mental lists, Perrin wondered
absently how far the Aes Sedai intended to push. Eavesdropping with
the Power! They might find a reaction from the Wise Ones worse than
Sorilea&rsquo;s bark. From Rand, too.</p>

<p>Not this time, however. Rand seemed unaware of them.
He looked right through Sorilea. Or maybe listened to something
nobody else could hear again. &ldquo;What of the wetlanders?&rdquo; he said
finally. &ldquo;Colavaere has been crowned queen, hasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; It
was not really a question.</p>

<p>Sorilea nodded, thumb tapping the hilt of her belt
knife, but her attention never left the Aes Sedai. Who was chosen
king or queen among the wetlanders was of small concern to Aiel,
especially among the treekilling Cairhienin.</p>

<p>An icicle stabbed into Perrin&rsquo;s chest. That
Colavaere of House Saighan wanted the Sun Throne was no secret; she
had schemed for it from the day Galldrian Riatin was assassinated,
before Rand had even declared himself the Dragon Reborn, and kept
scheming after it became public knowledge that Rand meant the
throne for Elayne. Few knew she was a cold-blooded murderer,
however. And Faile was in the city. At least she was not alone.
Bain and Chiad would be close to her. They were Maidens and her
friends, maybe almost what the Aiel called near-sisters; they would
not let her be harmed. The icicle would not go away, though.
Colavaere hated Rand, and by extension anyone close to Rand. Such
as, perhaps, the wife of a man who was Rand&rsquo;s friend. No. Bain
and Chiad would keep her safe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a delicate situation.&rdquo; Moving closer to
Rand, remarkably, Kiruna ignored Sorilea. For such a scrawny woman,
the Wise One had eyes like hammers. &ldquo;Whatever you do can have
serious repercussions. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has Colavaere said about me?&rdquo; Rand asked
Sorilea in a too-casual tone. &ldquo;Has she harmed Berelain?&rdquo; Berelain,
the First of Mayene, was who Rand had left in charge of Cairhien.
Why did he not ask about Faile?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Berelain sur Paendrag is well,&rdquo; Sorilea murmured,
without stopping her study of the Aes Sedai. Outwardly Kiruna
stayed calm despite being interrupted and ignored, but the gaze she
fixed on Rand could have frozen a forge-fire solid with the bellows
pumping. For the rest, Sorilea gestured to Feraighin.</p>

<p>The red-haired woman gave a start and cleared her
throat; plainly she had not expected to be allowed a word. She put
dignity back on like a hastily donned garment. &ldquo;Colavaere Saighan
says you have gone to Caemlyn, <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>, or
maybe to Tear, but wherever you have gone, all must remember that
you are the Dragon Reborn and must be obeyed.&rdquo; Feraighin sniffed;
the Dragon Reborn was no part of Aiel prophecies, only the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>. &ldquo;She says you will return and confirm
her on the throne. She speaks often to the chiefs, encouraging them
to move the spears south. In obedience to you, she says. She does
not see the Wise Ones, and hears only the wind when we speak.&rdquo; This
time her sniff was a fair approximation of Sorilea&rsquo;s. No one
told the clan chiefs what to do, but angering the Wise Ones was a
bad way to start convincing the chiefs of anything.</p>

<p>It made sense to Perrin, though, to the part of him
that could think of anything besides Faile. Colavaere probably had
never paid enough attention to the &ldquo;savages&rdquo; to realize the Wise
Ones did more than dispense herbs, but she would want every last
Aiel out of Cairhien. The question was, given the circumstances,
had any of the chiefs listened to her? But the question Rand asked
was not the obvious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What else has happened in the city? Anything
you&rsquo;ve heard, Feraighin. Maybe something that might only seem
important to a wetlander.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She tossed her red mane contemptuously. &ldquo;Wetlanders
are like sandflies, <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>: who can know
what they find important? Strange things sometimes happen in the
city, so I have heard, as they do among the tents. People sometimes
see things that cannot be, only for a time, what cannot be, is.
Men, women, children have died.&rdquo; Perrin&rsquo;s skin prickled: he
knew she meant what Rand called &ldquo;bubbles of evil,&rdquo; rising from the
Dark One&rsquo;s prison like froth in a fetid swamp, drifting along
the Pattern till they burst. Perrin had been caught in one once; he
never wanted to see another&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;If you mean what the wetlanders
do,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;who has time to watch sandflies? Unless they
bite. That minds me of one thing. I do not understand it, but
perhaps you do. These sandflies will bite sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What sandflies? Wetlanders? What are you talking
about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Feraighin was not as good as Sorilea at that level
look, yet no Wise One that Perrin had seen appreciated others&rsquo;
impatience. Not even the chief of chiefs&rsquo;. Thrusting her chin
up, she gathered her shawl and answered. &ldquo;Three days ago the
treekillers Caraline Damodred and Toram Riatin approached the city.
They issued a proclamation that Colavaere Saighan is a usurper, but
they sit in their camp south of the city and do nothing except send
a few people into the city now and then. Away from their camp, a
hundred of them will run from one <em>algai&rsquo;d&rsquo;siswai</em>, or even a <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>.
The man called Darlin Sisnera and other Tairens arrived by ship
below the city yesterday and joined them. They have been feasting
and drinking ever since, as if celebrating something. Treekiller
soldiers gather in the city at Colavaere Saighan&rsquo;s command,
yet they watch our tents more than they do the other
wetlanders&rsquo; or the city itself. They watch, and do nothing.
Perhaps you know the why of all this, <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>, but I do not, nor does Bair or Megana,
or anyone else in the tents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Caraline and Lord Toram led the Cairhienin who
refused to accept that Rand and the Aiel had conquered Cairhien,
just as High Lord Darlin led their counterparts in Tear. Neither
revolt amounted to much; Caraline and Toram had been sitting in the
foothills of the Spine of the World for months, making threats and
claims, and Darlin the same down in Haddon Mirk. But not any
longer, it seemed. Perrin found himself running a thumb lightly
along the edge of his axe. The Aiel were in danger of slipping
away, and Rand&rsquo;s enemies were coming together in one place.
All it needed now was for the Forsaken to appear. And Sevanna with
her Shaido. That would put the cream on the honeycake. Yet none of
it was any more important than whether somebody saw a nightmare
walking. Faile had to be safe; she just had to be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better watching than fighting,&rdquo; Rand murmured
thoughtfully, listening to something unseen again.</p>

<p>Perrin agreed with Rand wholeheartedly&mdash;just
about anything was better than fighting&mdash;but Aiel did not see
it that way, not when it came to enemies. From Rhuarc to Sorilea,
Feraighin to Nandera and Sulin, they stared as though Rand had said
sand was better to drink than water.</p>

<p>Feraighin drew herself up practically on tiptoe. She
was not particularly tall for an Aiel woman, not quite to
Rand&rsquo;s shoulder, but she appeared to be trying to put herself
nose-to-nose. &ldquo;There are few more than ten thousand in that
wetlander camp,&rdquo; she said reprovingly, &ldquo;and fewer in the city. They
can be dealt with easily. Even Indirian remembers that you
commanded no wetlander killed except in self-defense, but they will
make trouble left to themselves. It does not help that there are
Aes Sedai in the city. Who can know what they&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aes Sedai?&rdquo; The words came out cold, Rand&rsquo;s
knuckles white on the Dragon Scepter. &ldquo;How many?&rdquo; At the smell of
him the skin between Perrin&rsquo;s shoulders crawled; suddenly he
could <em>feel</em> the Aes Sedai prisoners watching, and Bera and
Kiruna and the rest.</p>

<p>Sorilea lost all interest in Kiruna. Her hands
planted themselves on her hips and her mouth narrowed. &ldquo;Why did you
not tell me this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You gave me no chance, Sorilea,&rdquo; Feraighin protested
a touch breathily, shoulders hunching. Blue eyes swung to Rand, and
her voice firmed. &ldquo;There may be as many as ten or more, <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>. We avoid them, of course, especially
since&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Back to Sorilea and breathiness. &ldquo;You did not want to
hear about the wetlanders, Sorilea. Only our own tents. You said
so.&rdquo; To Rand, her back straightening. &ldquo;Most of them stay beneath
the roof of Arilyn Dhulaine, <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>, and
seldom leave it.&rdquo; To Sorilea, hunching. &ldquo;Sorilea, you know I would
have told you everything. You cut me short.&rdquo; As she realized how
many were watching, and how many beginning to smile, among the Wise
Ones anyway, Feraighin&rsquo;s eyes grew wild, and her cheeks
reddened. Her head swung between Rand and Sorilea, and her mouth
worked but no sound came out. Some of the Wise Ones began laughing
behind their hands; Edarra did not bother with a hand. Rhuarc threw
back his head and roared.</p>

<p>Perrin certainly did not feel like laughing. An Aiel
could find something funny in having a sword stuck through him. Aes
Sedai on top of everything else. Light! He cut straight through to
what was important. &ldquo;Feraighin? My wife, Faile, is she well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave him a half-distracted stare, then visibly
pulled together the tatters of her poise. &ldquo;I think Faile Aybara is
well, <em>Sei&rsquo;cair</em>,&rdquo; she said with cool composure. Or
almost. She tried to sneak glances at Sorilea from the corner of
her eye. Sorilea was not amused, or anything close to it; arms
folded, she gave Feraighin a perusal that made the one she had
given Kiruna seem mild.</p>

<p>Amys put a hand on Sorilea&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;She is not at
fault,&rdquo; the younger woman murmured, too softly to reach any ears
but the leathery Wise One&rsquo;s and Perrin&rsquo;s. Sorilea
hesitated, then nodded; the flaying glare faded to her usual
cantankerousness. Amys was the only one Perrin had seen able to do
that, the only one Sorilea did not trample down when she got in her
way. Well, she did not trample Rhuarc, but with him it was more a
boulder ignoring a thunderstorm; Amys could make it stop
raining.</p>

<p>Perrin wanted more of Feraighin&mdash;she <em>thought</em> Faile was well?&mdash;but before he could open his
mouth, Kiruna bulled in with her usual tact.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, listen to me carefully,&rdquo; she told Rand,
gesturing emphatically under his nose. &ldquo;I called the situation
delicate. It is not. The situation is complex beyond your
imagining, so fragile a breath could shatter it. Bera and I will
accompany you to the city. Yes, yes, Alanna; and you, as well.&rdquo; She
waved away the slender Aes Sedai impatiently. Perrin thought she
was trying that looming trick. She did seem to be peering down her
nose at Rand, though tall as she was, he stood head and shoulders
taller. &ldquo;You must let yourself be guided by us. One wrong move, one
wrong word, and you may deliver to Cairhien the same disaster you
gave Tarabon and Arad Doman. Worse, you can do incalculable damage
to matters about which you know almost nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin winced. The whole speech could not have been
better designed to inflame Rand. But Rand simply listened till she
was done, then turned to Sorilea. &ldquo;Take the Aes Sedai to the
tents. All of them, for now. Make sure everyone knows they&rsquo;re
Aes Sedai. Let it be seen that they hop when you say toad. Since
you hop when the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> says it, that should
convince everybody I&rsquo;m not wearing an Aes Sedai leash.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kiruna&rsquo;s face grew bright red; she smelled of
outrage and indignation so strongly that Perrin&rsquo;s nose itched.
Bera tried to calm her, without much success, while shooting
you-ignorant-young-lout looks at Rand, and Alanna bit her lip in an
effort not to smile. Going by the odors drifting from Sorilea and
the others, Alanna had no reason to be pleased.</p>

<p>Sorilea gave Rand a slash of smile. &ldquo;Perhaps, <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>,&rdquo; she said dryly. Perrin doubted that she
hopped for anyone. &ldquo;Perhaps it will.&rdquo; She did not sound
convinced.</p>

<p>With another shake of his head, Rand stalked off with
Min, shadowed by the Maidens and issuing orders as to who was to go
with him and who with the Wise Ones. Rhuarc began ordering the <em>siswai&rsquo;aman</em>. Alanna followed Rand with her eyes. Perrin
wished he knew what was going on there. Sorilea and the others
watched Rand, too, and they smelled anything but gentle.</p>

<p>Feraighin was standing alone, he realized. Now was
his chance. But when he tried to catch her up, Sorilea and Amys and
the rest of the &ldquo;council&rdquo; surrounded her, neatly shouldering him
away. They moved some distance before they began showering her with
questions, the sharp looks directed at Kiruna and the other two
sisters leaving no doubt they would tolerate no further
eavesdropping. Kiruna appeared to be considering it, glowering till
it seemed a wonder her dark hair was not standing on end. Bera was
speaking to her firmly, and without trying Perrin heard &ldquo;sensible&rdquo;
and &ldquo;patience,&rdquo; &ldquo;cautious&rdquo; and &ldquo;foolish.&rdquo; Which applied to whom was
not evident.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There will be fighting when we reach the city.&rdquo; Aram
sounded eager.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; Loial said stoutly. His ears
twitched, and he peered uncomfortably at his axe. &ldquo;There won&rsquo;t
be, will there, Perrin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin shook his head. He did not know. If only the
other Wise Ones would leave Feraighin alone, just for a few
moments. What did they have to talk about that was so
important?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Women,&rdquo; Gaul muttered, &ldquo;are stranger than drunken
wetlanders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Perrin said absently. What would happen
should he simply push through the circle of Wise Ones?</p>

<p>As if she had read his mind Edarra gave him a pointed
frown. So did some of the others; sometimes it did seem women could
read men&rsquo;s minds. Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said women are strange, Perrin Aybara. Chiad told
me she would not lay a bridal wreath at my feet; she actually <em>told</em> me.&rdquo; The Aielman sounded scandalized. &ldquo;She said she would
take me for a lover, her and Bain, but no more.&rdquo; Another time that
would have shocked Perrin, though he had heard it before; Aiel were
incredibly&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;free&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;about such things. &ldquo;As if I am not good
enough for a husband.&rdquo; Gaul snorted angrily. &ldquo;I do not like Bain,
but I would marry her to make Chiad happy. If Chiad will not make a
bridal wreath, she should stop trying to entice me. If I cannot
catch her interest well enough for her to marry me, she should let
me go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin frowned at him. The green-eyed Aielman was
taller than Rand, nearly a head taller than he. &ldquo;What are you
talking about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chiad, of course. Have you not been listening? She
avoids me, but every time I see her, she pauses long enough to make
sure I have seen her. I do not know how you wetlanders do it, but
with us, that is one of the ways a woman uses. When you least
expect her, she is in your eyes, then gone. I did not even know she
was with the Maidens until this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean she&rsquo;s here?&rdquo; Perrin whispered. That
icicle was back, now a blade, hollowing him out. &ldquo;And Bain? Here,
too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gaul shrugged. &ldquo;One is seldom far from the other. But
it is Chiad&rsquo;s interest I want, not Bain&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn their bloody interest!&rdquo; Perrin shouted. The
Wise Ones turned to look at him. In fact, people all over the
hillside did. Kiruna and Bera were staring, faces entirely too
thoughtful. With an effort he managed to lower his voice. He could
do nothing about the intensity, though. &ldquo;They were supposed to be
protecting her! She&rsquo;s in the city, in the Royal Palace, with
Colavaere&mdash;with Colavaere!&mdash;and they were supposed to
be protecting her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scratching his head, Gaul looked at Loial. &ldquo;Is this
wetlander humor? Faile Aybara is out of short skirts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know she&rsquo;s not a child!&rdquo; Perrin drew a deep
breath. It was very hard keeping a level tone with his belly full
of acid. &ldquo;Loial, will you explain to this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to Gaul, that our
women don&rsquo;t run around with spears, that Colavaere
wouldn&rsquo;t offer to fight Faile, she&rsquo;d just order somebody
to cut her throat or throw her off a wall or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; The images
were too much. He was going to empty his stomach in a moment.</p>

<p>Loial patted him awkwardly on the shoulder. &ldquo;Perrin,
I know you&rsquo;re worried. I know how I&rsquo;d feel if I thought
anything happened to Erith.&rdquo; The tufts on his ears quivered. He was
a fine one to talk; he would run as hard as he could to avoid his
mother and the young Ogier woman she had chosen for him. &ldquo;Ah. Well.
Perrin, Faile is waiting for you, safe and sound. I know it. And
you know she can care for herself. Why, she could care for herself
and you and me, and Gaul, as well.&rdquo; His booming laugh sounded
forced, and it quickly faded to grave seriousness. &ldquo;Perrin&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Perrin, you know you can&rsquo;t always be there to protect Faile,
however much you want to. You are <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>; the
Pattern spun you out for a purpose, and it will use you for that
purpose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn the Pattern,&rdquo; Perrin growled. &ldquo;It can all burn,
if it keeps her safe.&rdquo; Loial&rsquo;s ears went rigid with shock, and
even Gaul looked taken aback.</p>

<p><em>What does that make me?</em> Perrin thought. He
had been scornful of those who scribbled and scrabbled for their
own ends, ignoring the Last Battle and the Dark One&rsquo;s shadow
creeping over the world. How was he different from them?</p>

<p>Rand reined the black in beside him. &ldquo;Are you
coming?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming,&rdquo; Perrin said bleakly. He had no
answer for his own questions, but he knew one thing. To him, Faile
<em>was</em> the world.</p>
