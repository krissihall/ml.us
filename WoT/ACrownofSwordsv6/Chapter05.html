and tall as the corridors were, they felt close,
and dim despite tall gilded stand-lamps with mirrors on every
branch, lit wherever daylight could not penetrate. Tapestries hung
few and far between on the walls, scenes of hunt or battle with
people and animals arranged more precisely than ever nature had.
Scattered niches held bowls and vases and now and then a small
statue, in gold or silver or alabaster, but even the statues seemed
to emphasize that they were stone or metal, as if the sculptors had
tried to banish curves.</p>

<p>The city&rsquo;s hush was magnified here. The sound of
their boots on the floor tiles echoed, a hollow foreboding march,
and Perrin did not think it was so to his ears alone. Loial&rsquo;s
quivered at every other step, and he peered down crossing corridors
as though wondering what might leap out. Min held herself stiffly
and took ginger steps, grimacing ruefully when she glanced at Rand;
she seemed to make an effort not to walk closer to him, and not
particularly pleased with herself over it. The young Cairhienin
started off swaggering like peacocks, but that arrogance faded as
the drumming of their heels reverberated. Even the Maidens felt it;
Sulin was the only one whose hand did not sometimes rise toward the
veil hanging down her chest.</p>

<p>There were servants everywhere, of course, pale,
narrow-faced men and women in dark coats and dresses with the
Rising Sun on the left breast and sleeves striped in
Colavaere&rsquo;s colors. Some gaped in recognition as Rand passed
by; a handful dropped to their knees, heads bowed. Most went on
about their tasks after a small pause for deep bow or curtsy. It
was just as in the courtyard. Show proper respect to your betters,
whoever they are; obey them and otherwise ignore what they do, and
perhaps you will not be entangled in it. It was a way of thinking
that set Perrin&rsquo;s teeth on edge. Nobody should have to live
that way.</p>

<p>Two fellows in Colavaere&rsquo;s livery, standing
before the gilt-covered doors to the Grand Hall of the Sun, frowned
at sight of the Maidens, and maybe at the young Cairhienin. Older
folk usually looked askance at the younglings&rsquo; carrying on every bit
as much as the Aiel did. More than one parent had tried to put an
end to it, had ordered sons or daughters to give over, instructed
armsmen and servants to chase off others&rsquo; like-minded sons and
daughters like common vagrants or street ruffians. Perrin would not
have been surprised if these doormen slanted their gilded staffs to
stop Selande and her friends from going through the open doorways,
nobility or not, and perhaps even the Maidens. Few Cairhienin still
dared call Aiel savages, not where they could be heard, but most
thought it. The pair gathered themselves, drew deep breaths&mdash;and saw Rand over the Maidens&rsquo; heads. Their eyes nearly popped
out of their faces. Each man glanced sideways at the other, and
then they were on their knees. One stared fixedly at the floor; the
other squeezed his eyes shut, and Perrin heard him praying under
his breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I loved,&rdquo; Rand said softly. He hardly sounded
himself. Min touched his arm, her face pained. Rand patted her hand
without looking at her, and for some reason that seemed to pain her
even more.</p>

<p>The Grand Hall of the Sun was immense, with an
angle-vaulted ceiling a full fifty paces high at its peak and great
golden lamps hung on gilded chains thick enough to move the gates
of a fortress. It was immense, and it was full, people crowding
among massive square columns of blue-black veined marble that stood
in two rows to either side of the center aisle. The folk at the
rear noticed the newcomers first. In long coats and short, some in
bright colors or embroidered, some travel-worn, they stared
curiously. Intently. The few women in the back of the hall wore
riding dresses and had faces as hard as the men, gazes as
direct.</p>

<p>Hunters for the Horn, Perrin thought. Dobraine had
said that every noble who could be there would, and most Hunters
were nobly born, or claimed to be. Whether or not they recognized
Rand, they sensed something, hands feeling for swords and daggers
that were not there this evening. More Hunters than not sought
adventure and a place in the histories along with the Horn of
Valere. Even if they did not know the Dragon Reborn, they knew
danger when they saw it.</p>

<p>The others in the Grand Hall were less attuned to
danger, or rather, more to intrigues and plots than to open hazard.
Perrin was a third of the way down the long center aisle, close on
Rand&rsquo;s heels, before gasps ran through the chamber like a
wind. Pale Cairhienin lords with colorful slashes across the chests
of their dark silk coats, some with the front of their heads shaved
and powdered; Cairhienin ladies with stripes on their dark
high-necked gowns and lace falls covering their hands, their hair
in intricate towers that often added a good foot of height. Tairen
High Lords and Lords of the Land with oiled beards trimmed to
points, in velvet hats and coats of red and blue and every color,
with puffy, satin-striped sleeves; Tairen ladies in even more
colorful gowns, with wide lace ruffs and close caps studded with
pearls and moonstones, firedrops and rubies. They knew Perrin, and
they knew Dobraine and even Havien and Min, but most importantly,
they knew Rand. A ripple of knowing that kept pace up the Hall with
him. Eyes widening, jaws dropping, they went so stiff Perrin almost
thought the Asha&rsquo;man had bound them like the guards outside
the palace. The chamber was a sea of sweet perfumes, and beneath
that undercurrents of salty sweat, but through it oozed fear, a
quivering sort of smell.</p>

<p>His attention was all on the far end of the Hall,
though, on the deep blue marble dais where the Sun Throne stood,
shining like its namesake with gilt, the wavy-rayed Rising Sun huge
atop the high back. Colavaere rose slowly, peering down the aisle
over Rand&rsquo;s head. Her nearly black dress bore not a single
stripe of nobility, but the great mass of curls rising above her
head had to have been dressed around the crown she wore, the Rising
Sun in gold and yellow diamonds. Seven young women flanked the Sun
Throne in dark-bodiced gowns with lace snugged under their chins
and skirts striped vertically in Colavaere&rsquo;s yellow and red
and silver. It seemed that Cairhienin fashion was different for the
Queen, and for the Queen&rsquo;s attendants.</p>

<p>A flicker of motion behind the throne picked out an
eighth woman, hidden, but Perrin cared about neither Colavaere nor
anyone else except the woman to her immediate right. Faile. Her
slightly tilted eyes fastened on him, dark liquid moons, yet not a
line altered of her coolly decorous expression. If anything, her
face grew tighter. His nose strained for the scent of her, but the
perfume was too strong, and the fear. She had a reason for being
there on the dais, a good reason. She did.</p>

<p>Rand touched Sulin&rsquo;s sleeve. &ldquo;Wait here,&rdquo; he
said. Scowling, the scar on her leathery face standing out as white
as her hair, she scanned his face, then nodded with obvious
reluctance. Her free hand gestured anyway, and another gasp ran
through the chamber as the Maidens veiled. It was almost laughable;
the eight men in black coats, trying to watch everywhere at once,
could probably kill them all before the first Maiden drove home a
spear, but no one knew who or what they were. No one looked at them
twice, a handful of men with their swords sheathed. Only at the
Maidens. And Rand. Hadn&rsquo;t they noticed that not a one of those
men sweated a drop more than Rand? Perrin felt as if he were
bathing in his.</p>

<p>Stepping past the Maidens with Min still close beside
him, Rand stopped as first Perrin, then Dobraine and Havien joined
him. And Aram, of course, like Perrin&rsquo;s shadow. Rand studied
them each in turn, nodding slowly. He studied Perrin longest, and
took the longest time to nod. The gray-haired Cairhienin and the
young Mayener wore faces like death. Perrin did not know how his
own looked, but his jaw was locked tight. No one was going to harm
Faile, no matter what she had done, no matter why. No matter what
he had to do to stop it.</p>

<p>Their boots drummed loud in the silence as they
crossed the huge golden mosaic of the Rising Sun in the blue-tiled
floor and approached the throne. Hands gripping her skirts,
Colavaere wet her lips, and her eyes darted between Rand and the
doors behind him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looking for Aes Sedai?&rdquo; Rand&rsquo;s voice echoed. He
smiled unpleasantly. &ldquo;I sent them to the Aiel camp. If the Aiel
can&rsquo;t teach them manners, no one can.&rdquo; A shocked murmur rose,
and fell raggedly. Fear became stronger than the perfumes in
Perrin&rsquo;s nose.</p>

<p>Colavaere gave a start. &ldquo;Why would I&mdash;?&rdquo; Drawing
a deep breath, she gathered dignity. A more than handsome woman in
her middle years, without a touch of gray in her dark hair, she
bore a regal presence that had nothing to do with the crown. She
had been born to command; to reign, so she thought. And her eyes,
weighing and measuring, betrayed a hard intelligence. &ldquo;My Lord
Dragon,&rdquo; she said, making a curtsy so deep it nearly mocked itself, &ldquo;I welcome you back. Cairhien welcomes you back.&rdquo; The way she said
it, she seemed to be repeating herself.</p>

<p>Slowly Rand climbed the steps of the dais. Min
half-made to follow him, then folded her arms. Perrin did follow,
to be nearer Faile, but only partway. It was her gaze that stopped
him. A gaze that probed every bit as much as Colavaere&rsquo;s. At
him as much as at Rand. Perrin wished he could smell her. Not to
try discovering why or what, just for the smell of her. The wash of
perfumes and fright was too great Why did she not speak? Why did
she not come to him? Or smile? Just a smile.</p>

<p>Colavaere stiffened a splinter&rsquo;s worth, but only
that. Her head came no more than level with Rand&rsquo;s chest,
though her towered hair rose almost as tall as he. His eyes slid
from her face and along the women lined up on either side of the
throne. He might have paused on Faile. Perrin could not be
sure.</p>

<p>Rand rested his hand on one heavy arm of the Sun
Throne. &ldquo;You know I mean this for Elayne Trakand.&rdquo; His voice was
emotionless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord Dragon,&rdquo; Colavaere replied smoothly, &ldquo;Cairhien had been too long without a ruler. A Cairhienin ruler.
You yourself said you have no interest in the Sun Throne for
yourself. Elayne Trakand would have had some claim,&rdquo; a small, quick
gesture dismissed such a claim, &ldquo;if she were alive. Rumor says she
is dead, like her mother.&rdquo; A dangerous thing to say. A good many
rumors said Rand had killed both mother and daughter. The woman was
no coward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elayne is alive.&rdquo; The words were still flat as a
planed board, but Rand&rsquo;s eyes burned. Perrin could not pick
out his smell any more than Faile&rsquo;s, but he did not need his
nose to know rage bottled right in front of him. &ldquo;She will have the
crowns of Andor, and of Cairhien.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord Dragon, what is done cannot be undone. If
anything has offended you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>For all her dignity, all her courage, Colavaere made
a visible effort not to flinch as Rand reached out and took hold of
the Sun Crown. There was a loud crack of metal snapping, and the
crown flexed, hardly disarraying her tower of curls as it pulled
away, slowly straightening. A few of the brilliant yellow stones
popped from their settings and fell. He held up the stretched arc
of metal, and slowly it bent back on itself until the ends met, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Maybe the Asha&rsquo;man could see what happened, could
understand, but to Perrin, one moment the crown was broken, the
next it was whole again. No one among the nobles made a sound, not
even a shuffling of boots; Perrin thought they might be afraid to.
To his nose, stark terror was stronger than any other scent now. It
did not quiver; it spasmed wildly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever can be done,&rdquo; Rand said softly, &ldquo;can be
undone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Colavaere&rsquo;s face drained of blood. The few wisps
of hair that had escaped her coiffure made her seem wild, at bay.
Swallowing, she opened her mouth twice before any words came out. &ldquo;My Lord Dragon&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; It was a breathy whisper, but as she went
on, her voice became stronger. And edged with desperation. She
seemed to forget anyone else was present. &ldquo;I have kept the laws you
made, maintained your policies. Even those that go against the
ancient laws of Cairhien, against all custom.&rdquo; She probably meant
the laws that had let a noble kill a farmer or craftsman and walk
away. &ldquo;My Lord Dragon, the Sun Throne is yours to give. I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;know that. I&mdash;I was wrong to take it without your leave. But
I have the right to it, by birth and blood. If I must have it from
your hand, then give it to me, by your hand. I have the right!&rdquo;
Rand only looked at her; he said nothing. He seemed to be
listening, but not to her.</p>

<p>Perrin cleared his throat. Why was Rand dragging this
out? It was done, or nearly. Let whatever else had to be done, be
done. Then he could take Faile away, where they could talk. &ldquo;Did
you have the right to murder Lord Maringil and High Lord Meilan?&rdquo;
Perrin demanded. There was no doubt in his mind she had had it
done; they had been her biggest rivals for the throne. Or she, and
they, thought they were, anyway. Why was Rand just standing there?
He knew all of this. &ldquo;Where is Berelain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before the name was off his tongue he wanted to call
it back. Faile only glanced at him, her face still a cool mask of
propriety, but that glance could have set water aflame. &ldquo;A jealous
wife is like a hornets&rsquo; nest in your mattress,&rdquo; the saying
went. No matter how you twitched, you got stung.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You dare accuse me of so vile a crime?&rdquo; Colavaere
demanded. &ldquo;There is no proof. There can be no proof! Not when I am
innocent.&rdquo; Abruptly she seemed to become aware of where she was, of
the nobles crowded shoulder-to-shoulder among the columns, watching
and listening. Whatever else could be said of her, she did have
courage. Standing straight, she did her best to stare Rand in the
eye without tilting her head too far back. &ldquo;My Lord Dragon, nine
days ago at sunrise I was crowned Queen of Cairhien according to
the laws and usages of Cairhien. I will keep my oath of fealty to
you, but I am Queen of Cairhien.&rdquo; Rand only stared at her, silent.
And troubled, Perrin would have said. &ldquo;My Lord Dragon, I am Queen,
unless you would rip all our laws away.&rdquo; Still silence from Rand,
and an unblinking stare.</p>

<p><em>Why doesn&rsquo;t he end it?</em> Perrin
wondered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These charges against me are false. They are mad!&rdquo;
Only that silent stare for answer. Colavaere moved her head
uneasily. &ldquo;Annoura, advise me. Come, Annoura! Advise me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin thought she spoke to one of the women with
Faile, but the woman who stepped from behind the throne did not
wear the striped skirts of an attendant. A broad face with a wide
mouth and a beak of a nose regarded Rand from beneath dozens of
long thin dark braids. An ageless face. To Perrin&rsquo;s surprise,
Havien made a sound in his throat and began grinning. His own
hackles were standing straight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot do this, Colavaere,&rdquo; the Aes Sedai said in
a Taraboner accent, shifting her gray-fringed shawl. &ldquo;I fear I have
allowed you to misperceive my relationship to you.&rdquo; Drawing a deep
breath, she added, &ldquo;There&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;there is no need for this, Master
al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo; Her voice became slightly unsteady for a moment. &ldquo;Or
my Lord Dragon, if you prefer. I assure you, I harbor no ill
intentions toward you. If I did, I would have struck before you
knew I was here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might well have died if you had,&rdquo; Rand&rsquo;s
voice was icy steel; his face made it seem soft. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not who
has you shielded, Aes Sedai. Who are you? Why are you here? Answer
me! I don&rsquo;t have much patience with&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;your kind. Unless
you want to be hauled out to the Aiel camp? I wager the Wise Ones
can make you speak freely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This Annoura was not slow-witted. Her eyes darted to
Aram, then to the aisle where the Asha&rsquo;man stood. And she
knew. They had to be who he meant, in their black coats, grim faces
dry when every other but hers and Rand&rsquo;s glistened. Young
Jahar was watching her like a hawk watching a rabbit.
Incongruously, Loial stood in the midst of them with his axe
propped against his shoulder. One big hand managed to hold an ink
bottle and an open book, pressed awkwardly against his chest, while
the other scribbled as fast as he could dip a pen fatter than
Perrin&rsquo;s thumb. He was taking notes. Here!</p>

<p>The nobles heard Rand as well as Annoura did. They
had been watching the veiled Maidens uneasily; now they crowded
back from the Asha&rsquo;man, pressing together like fish in a
barrel. Here and there someone sagged in a faint, held up by the
throng.</p>

<p>Shivering, Annoura adjusted her shawl, and regained
all the vaunted Aes Sedai composure. &ldquo;I am Annoura Larisen, my Lord
Dragon. Of the Gray Ajah.&rdquo; Nothing about her said that she was
shielded, and in the presence of men who could channel. She seemed
to answer as a favor. &ldquo;I am the advisor to Berelain, First of
Mayene.&rdquo; So that was why Havien was grinning like a madman; he had
recognized the woman. Perrin did not feel like grinning at all. &ldquo;This has been kept secret, you understand,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;because
of the attitude of Tear both toward Mayene and toward Aes Sedai,
but I think me the time for secrets, it is past, yes?&rdquo; Annoura
turned to Colavaere, and her mouth firmed. &ldquo;I let you think what
you would think, but Aes Sedai do not become advisors simply
because someone tells them they are. Most especially when they
already advise someone else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Berelain confirms your story,&rdquo; Rand said, &ldquo;I will
parole you to her custody.&rdquo; Looking at the crown, he seemed to
realize for the first time that the spray of gold and gems was
still in his hand. Very gently he set it on the silk-covered seat
of the Sun Throne. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think every Aes Sedai is my enemy,
not entirely, but I won&rsquo;t be schemed against, and I won&rsquo;t
be manipulated, not anymore. It&rsquo;s your choice, Annoura, but if
you make the wrong one, you will go to the Wise Ones. If you live
long enough. I won&rsquo;t hobble the Asha&rsquo;man, and a mistake
could cost you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Asha&rsquo;man,&rdquo; Annoura said calmly. &ldquo;I quite
understand.&rdquo; But she touched her lips with her tongue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord Dragon, Colavaere plotted to break her oath
of fealty.&rdquo; Perrin had wished so hard for Faile to speak that he
jumped when she did, stepping out of the line of attendants.
Choosing her words carefully, she confronted the would-be queen
like a stooping eagle. Light, but she was beautiful! &ldquo;Colavaere
swore to obey you in all things and uphold your laws, but she has
made plans to rid Cairhien of the Aiel, to send them south and
return all to as it was before you came. She also said that if you
ever returned, you would not dare change anything she had done. The
woman she told these things, Maire, was one of her attendants.
Maire vanished soon after telling me. I have no proof, but I
believe she is dead. I believe Colavaere regretted revealing too
much of her mind, too soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dobraine strode up the steps to the dais, his helmet
under his arm. His face might have been cold iron. &ldquo;Colavaere
Saighan,&rdquo; he announced in a formal voice that carried to every
corner of the Grand Hall, &ldquo;by my immortal soul, under the Light, I,
Dobraine, High Seat of House Taborwin, do arraign and censure you
of treason, the penalty for which is death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s head went back, eyes closed. His mouth
moved slightly, but Perrin knew that only he and Rand heard what
was said. &ldquo;No. I cannot. I will not.&rdquo; Perrin understood the delay
now. Rand was searching for a way out. Perrin wished he could see
one.</p>

<p>Colavaere certainly did not hear, but she wanted a
way out, too. She looked around wildly, to the Sun Throne, to her
other attendants, to the assembled nobility, as though they might
step forward to defend her. Their feet could as well have been set
in cement; a sea of carefully blank, sweaty faces confronted her,
and eyes that avoided hers. Some of those eyes rolled toward the
Asha&rsquo;man, but not too openly. The already considerable space
between nobles and Asha&rsquo;man widened noticeably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lies!&rdquo; she hissed, hands knotted in her skirts. &ldquo;All
lies! You sneaking little&mdash;!&rdquo; She took a step toward Faile.
Rand stretched his arm between them, though Colavaere appeared not
to see it, and Faile looked as though she wished he had not. Anyone
who attacked her was in for a surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faile does not lie!&rdquo; Perrin growled. Well, not about
something like this.</p>

<p>Once again Colavaere recovered herself. Slight as her
height was, she drew up every inch of it. Perrin almost admired
her. Except for Meilan, and Maringil, and this Maire, and the Light
alone knew how many others. &ldquo;I demand justice, my Lord Dragon.&rdquo; Her
voice was calm, stately. Royal. &ldquo;There is no proof of any of this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;this filth. A claim that someone who is no longer in Cairhien
says I spoke words I never did? I demand the Lord Dragon&rsquo;s
justice. By your own laws, there must be proof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know she is no longer in Cairhien?&rdquo;
Dobraine demanded. &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I assume she has gone,&rdquo; She addressed her answer to
Rand. &ldquo;Maire left my service, and I replaced her with Reale,
there.&rdquo; She gestured toward the third attendant on the left. &ldquo;I
have no idea where she is. Bring her forward if she is in the city,
and let her make these ridiculous charges to my face. I will fling
her lies in her face.&rdquo; Faile looked murder at her. Perrin hoped she
would not produce one of those knives she kept hidden about her;
she had a habit of doing that when she became angry enough.</p>

<p>Annoura cleared her throat. She had been studying
Rand much too closely for Perrin&rsquo;s comfort. She reminded him
of Verin suddenly, that look of a bird examining a worm. &ldquo;May I
speak, Master&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;my Lord Dragon?&rdquo; At his curt nod, she
went on, adjusting her shawl. &ldquo;Of young Maire, I know nothing
except that one morning she was here, and before nightfall, she was
nowhere to be found and none knew where she had gone. But Lord
Maringil and High Lord Meilan, they are a different matter. The
First of Mayene, she brought with her two most excellent
thief-catchers, men experienced in ferreting out crimes. They have
brought before me two of the men who waylaid the High Lord Meilan
in the streets, though both insist they only held his arms while
others did the stabbing. Also they brought me the servant who put
poison in the spiced wine Lord Maringil liked to drink at bedtime.
She also protests her true innocence; her invalid mother would have
died, and she herself, had Lord Maringil not. So she says, and in
her case, I believe she speaks truly. Her solace at confession was
not false, I think. Both the men and the woman agree in this: the
orders for their actions came from the mouth of Lady Colavaere
herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Word by word the defiance leached out of Colavaere.
She still stood, yet it seemed a wonder; she appeared as limp as a
damp rag. &ldquo;They promised,&rdquo; she mumbled to Rand. &ldquo;They promised you
would never return.&rdquo; Too late, she clamped both hands over her
mouth. Her eyes bulged. Perrin wished he could not hear the sounds
coming from her throat. No one should make sounds like that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Treason and murder.&rdquo; Dobraine sounded satisfied.
Those whimpered screams did not touch him. &ldquo;The penalty is the
same, my Lord Dragon. Death. Except, by your new law, it is hanging
for murder.&rdquo; For some reason, Rand looked at Min. She returned his
gaze with profound sadness. Not for Colavaere. For Rand. Perrin
wondered whether a viewing was involved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I demand the headsman,&rdquo; Colavaere managed
in a strangled voice. Her face sagged. She had become old on the
spot, and her eyes were mirrors of stark terror. But with nothing
left, she fought on, for the scraps. &ldquo;It is&mdash;it is my right.
I will not be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;hanged like some commoner!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand seemed to struggle with himself, shaking his
head in that disturbing way. When he spoke at last, his words were
winter cold and anvil hard. &ldquo;Colavaere Saighan, I strip you of your
titles.&rdquo; He drove the words like nails. &ldquo;I strip of you of your
lands and estates and possessions, of everything but the dress you
stand in. Do you own&mdash;did you own a farm? A small farm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Each sentence staggered the woman. She swayed
drunkenly on her feet, soundlessly mouthing the word &ldquo;farm&rdquo; as if
she had never heard it before. Annoura, Faile, everyone stared at
Rand in amazement or curiosity or both. Perrin not least. A farm?
If there had been silence in the Grand Hall before, now it seemed
that no one even breathed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dobraine, did she own a small farm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She owns&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;owned&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;many farms, my Lord
Dragon,&rdquo; the Cairhienin replied slowly. Clearly he understood no
more than Perrin did. &ldquo;Most are large. But the lands near the
Dragonwall have always been divided into smallholdings, less than
fifty hides. All of the tenants abandoned them during the Aiel
War.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand nodded. &ldquo;Time to change that. Too much land has
lain fallow too long. I want to move people back there, to farm
again. Dobraine, you will find out which farm of those Colavaere
owned near the Dragonwall is the smallest. Colavaere, I exile you
to that farm. Dobraine will see you&rsquo;re provided with what is
needed to make a farm work, and with someone to teach you how to
till the soil. And with guards to see that you never go farther
from it than you can walk in a day, so long as you live. See to it,
Dobraine. In a week I want her on her way.&rdquo; A bewildered Dobraine
hesitated before nodding. Perrin could catch murmurs from the
assembly behind him now. This was unheard of. None understood why
she was not to die. And the rest! Estates had been confiscated
before, but never all, never nobility itself. Nobles had been
exiled, even for life, but never to a <em>farm</em>.</p>

<p>Colavaere&rsquo;s response was immediate. Eyes rolling
up in her head, she collapsed, crumpling backward toward the
steps.</p>

<p>Perrin darted to catch her, but someone was ahead of
him. Before he had taken a full step, her fall simply stopped. She
slumped in midair, slanting over the steps to the dais, head
dangling. Slowly, her unconscious form rose, swung around and
settled gently in front of the Sun Throne. Rand. Perrin was sure
the Asha&rsquo;man would have let her fall.</p>

<p>Annoura <em>tsk</em>ed. She did not appear surprised,
or perturbed, except that her thumbs rubbed her forefingers
nervously. &ldquo;I suspect she would have preferred the headsman. I will
see to her if you have your man, your&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Asha&rsquo;man&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not your concern,&rdquo; Rand said roughly. &ldquo;She is alive, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She is alive.&rdquo; He drew a long, ragged
breath. Min was there before he let it out; she only stood near
him, yet she looked as if she wanted to do something more. Slowly
his face firmed. &ldquo;Annoura, you will take me to Berelain. Release
her, Jahar; she&rsquo;ll be no trouble. Not with one of her and nine
of us. I want to find out what has been going on while I was away,
Annoura. And what Berelain means bringing you here behind my back.
No, don&rsquo;t speak. I&rsquo;ll hear it from her. Perrin, I know
you want some time with Faile. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s gaze swept slowly around the hall, over
all the nobles waiting silently. Under his stare, none dared move a
muscle. The scent of fear far outweighed any other, convulsing
sharply. Except for the Hunters, everyone there had given him the
same oath as had Colavaere. Perhaps just being in this gathering
was treason, too? Perrin did not know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This audience is at an end,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;I will
forget every face that departs now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those at the front, the highest-ranking, the most
powerful, began their progress toward the doors without too much
haste, avoiding the Maidens and the Asha&rsquo;man standing in the
aisle, while the rest waited their turn. Every mind must have been
turning over what Rand had said, though. What precisely did he mean
by &ldquo;now&rdquo;? Purposeful strides quickened, skirts were lifted.
Hunters, nearest the doors, began slipping out, first one at a
time, then in a flood, and seeing them, lesser nobles among the
Cairhienin and Tairens darted ahead of the higher. In moments it
was a milling mass at the doors, men and women pushing and elbowing
to get out. Not one looked back at the woman stretched out before
the throne she had held so briefly.</p>
