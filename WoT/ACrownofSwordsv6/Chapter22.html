<h4><em>Small Sacrifices</em></h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">S</span>quinting
up at the sign above the inn&rsquo;s arched
door, a crudely drawn woman with a walking staff peering hopefully
into the distance, Elayne wished she were back in her bed instead
of up with the sun. Not that she could have slept. Mol Hara Square
stood empty behind her except for a few creaking ox- and
donkey-carts on their way to the markets, a scattering of women
balancing huge baskets on their heads. A one-legged beggar sat with
his bowl at a corner of the inn, the first of many who would dot
the square later; she had already given him a silver mark, enough
to feed him for a week even now, but he tucked it under his ragged
coat with a toothless grin and waited on. The sky was still gray,
yet the day already promised to scorch. Keeping concentration well
enough to ignore the heat was a problem this morning.</p>

<p>The last remnants of Birgitte&rsquo;s morning-after
head remained in the back of her own, dwindling but not yet gone.
If only her small ability with Healing had not proved too small.
She hoped Aviendha and Birgitte would manage to learn something
useful about Carridin this morning, in their Illusion disguises.
Not that Carridin would know any of them from a shoemaker, of
course, but it was best to be careful. She felt pride that Aviendha
had not asked to come along here, had in fact been surprised at the
suggestion. Aviendha did not believe she needed anyone to watch
her, to make sure she did what was needful.</p>

<p>With a sigh, she straightened her dress, though there
was no need. Blue and cream, with a bit of cream-colored Vandalra
lace, the garment did make her feel just a touch&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;exposed. The
only time she had balked at donning a local fashion was while she
and Nynaeve traveled to Tanchico with the Sea Folk, but in its own
way, Ebou Dari fashion was almost&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She sighed again. She was
just trying to delay. Aviendha should have come to lead her by the
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not apologize,&rdquo; Nynaeve said suddenly at her
shoulder. She clutched her own gray skirts with both hands, staring
at The Wandering Woman as though Moghedien herself waited inside. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have worn white after all,&rdquo; Elayne
murmured, earning a suspicious sideways glance. After a moment, she
added, &ldquo;You did say it was the color for funerals.&rdquo; Which produced
a satisfied nod, though it was not what she had meant at all. This
<em>would</em> be disaster if they could not keep peace among
themselves. Birgitte had had to settle for an infusion of herbs
this morning, and a particularly bitter mix at that, because
Nynaeve claimed she was not angry enough to channel. She had gone
on in the most dramatic manner about funeral white being the only
suitable color, insisted she was not coming, until Elayne dragged
her out of their apartments, and announced at least twenty times
since that she would not apologize. Peace had to be kept, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;You agreed to this, Nynaeve. No, I don&rsquo;t want to hear any
more about the rest of us bullying you. You agreed. So stop
sulking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve spluttered, eyes going wide with outrage. She
was not to be diverted, though, despite one fiercely incredulous
&ldquo;<em>Sulking?</em>&rdquo; under her breath. &ldquo;We need to discuss this
further, Elayne. There is no need to be so hasty. There must be a
thousand reasons why this won&rsquo;t work, <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>
or no <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, and Mat Cauthon is nine hundred of
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne gave her a level look. &ldquo;Did you deliberately
choose the bitterest herbs that would work this morning?&rdquo; Wide-eyed
outrage turned to wide-eyed innocence, but red stained
Nynaeve&rsquo;s cheeks. Elayne pushed open the door. Nynaeve
followed, muttering. Elayne would not have been surprised if she
stuck out her tongue, too. Sulky was not even in it, this
morning.</p>

<p>The smell of breads baking wafted from the kitchens,
and all the shutters were open to air out the common room. A
plump-cheeked serving woman standing atop a tall stool stretched on
tiptoes to take down bedraggled evergreen branches from above the
windows, while others replaced tables and benches and chairs that
must have been taken away for the dancing. This early, no one else
was about, except for a skinny girl in a white apron, sweeping
halfheartedly with a brush-broom. She might have been pretty if her
mouth had not seemed set in a constant pout. There was surprisingly
little mess, considering that inns were supposed to be riotous,
even licentious, during festivals. A part of her wished she could
have seen it, though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you direct me to Master Cauthon&rsquo;s rooms?&rdquo;
she asked the skinny girl with a smile, proffering two silver
pennies. Nynaeve sniffed. <em>She</em> was tight as the skin on a
fresh apple; she had given the beggar one <em>copper</em>!</p>

<p>The girl eyed them sullenly&mdash;and surprisingly,
the coins as well&mdash;and mumbled something sour that sounded
like, &ldquo;A gilded woman last night and ladies this morning.&rdquo; She gave
directions grudgingly. For a moment Elayne thought she intended to
scorn the pennies, but on the point of turning away, the girl
snatched the silver from her hand without so much as a word of
thanks, pausing only to tuck them into the neck of her dress, of
all places, before she set to swinging her broom as if to beat the
floor to death. Perhaps she had a pocket sewn in there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Nynaeve grumbled under her breath. &ldquo;You
mark me, he tried to push his attentions on that young woman.
That&rsquo;s the sort of man you want me to apologize to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne said nothing, only led the way up the railless
steps at the back of the room. If Nynaeve did not stop complaining&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The first hallway on the right, the girl had said, and the
last door on the left, but in front of it, she hesitated, biting
her lower lip.</p>

<p>Nynaeve brightened. &ldquo;You see it&rsquo;s a bad idea
now, don&rsquo;t you? We aren&rsquo;t Aiel, Elayne. I like the girl
well enough, for all she&rsquo;s forever fondling that knife of
hers, but just think of the absolute drivel she talked. It&rsquo;s
impossible. You must know it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We did not agree to anything impossible, Nynaeve.&rdquo;
Keeping her voice firm took an effort. Some of what Aviendha had
suggested, apparently in all seriousness&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She actually had
suggested letting the man switch them! &ldquo;What we did agree to is
quite possible.&rdquo; Barely. She rapped loudly on the paneled door with
her knuckles. There was a fish carved on the door, a round thing
with stripes and a snout. All of the doors had different carvings,
most of fish. There was no answer.</p>

<p>Nynaeve puffed out a breath she must have been
holding. &ldquo;Perhaps he has gone out. We&rsquo;ll just have to come
back another time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At this hour?&rdquo; She rapped once more. &ldquo;You say he
always lies abed when he can.&rdquo; Still no sound from inside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elayne, if Birgitte is any indication, Mat got
himself juicy as a fiddler last night. He won&rsquo;t thank us for
waking him. Why don&rsquo;t we just go away and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne lifted the latch and went in. Nynaeve followed
with a sigh that could have been heard back in the Palace.</p>

<p>Mat Cauthon was sprawled on his bed atop the knitted
red coverlet, a folded cloth lying over his eyes and dripping onto
the pillow. The room was not very tidy despite the absence of dust.
A boot stood on the washstand&mdash;the washstand!&mdash;next to
a white basin full of unused water, the stand-mirror sat askew, as
if he had stumbled into it and simply left it tilted back sharply,
and his wrinkled coat lay tossed across a ladder-back chair. He
wore everything else, including that black scarf he seemed never to
take off, and the other boot. The silver foxhead dangled from his
unlaced shirt.</p>

<p>The medallion made her fingers itch. If he really was
lying there sodden with drink, she might be able to remove it
unfelt. One way or another, she intended to find out how the thing
absorbed the Power. Finding out how almost anything worked was a
fascination to her, but that foxhead was all the puzzles in the
world rolled into one.</p>

<p>Nynaeve caught her sleeve and jerked her head toward
the door, silently mouthing &ldquo;asleep&rdquo; and something else she could
not make out. Probably another plea to go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave me alone, Nerim,&rdquo; he mumbled suddenly. &ldquo;I told
you before; I don&rsquo;t want anything but a new skull. And close
the door softly, or I&rsquo;ll pin your ears to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve jumped, and tried to pull her toward the
door, but she stood her ground. &ldquo;It is not Nerim, Master
Cauthon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Raising his head from the pillow, he used both hands
to lift the cloth a trifle and squinted at them with reddened
eyes.</p>

<p>Grinning, Nynaeve made no effort at all to hide her
pleasure at his wretched state. What Elayne could not understand at
first was why she wanted to grin, too. Her one experience with
drinking too much had left her with nothing but pity and sympathy
for anyone so snared. In the back of her mind she felt
Birgitte&rsquo;s head throbbing still, and it came to her. Certainly
she could not like Birgitte drowning herself in drink, whatever
the reason, but neither could she like the thought that anyone
could do anything at all better than her first Warder. A ridiculous
thought. Embarrassing. But satisfying, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; he demanded hoarsely, then
winced and lowered his voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the middle of the
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s morning,&rdquo; Nynaeve said sharply. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember talking with Birgitte?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you not be so loud?&rdquo; he whispered, closing his
eyes. The next instant, they popped open again. &ldquo;Birgitte?&rdquo; Sitting
up abruptly, he swung his legs over the side of the bed. For a time
he just sat there, peering at the floorboards, elbows on his knees
and the medallion swinging from its thong around his neck. At last
he turned his head to look at them balefully. Or perhaps his eyes
just made it seem so. &ldquo;What did she tell you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She informed us of your demands, Master Cauthon,&rdquo;
Elayne said formally. This must be how it felt to stand before the
headsman&rsquo;s block, there was nothing for it but to keep her
head high and face whatever came proudly. &ldquo;I wish to thank you from
my heart for rescuing me from the Stone of Tear.&rdquo; There, she had
begun, and it had not hurt. Not very much.</p>

<p>Nynaeve stood there, glowering, her lips growing
tighter and tighter. The woman was <em>not</em> going to leave her
to do this alone. Elayne embraced the Source almost before she
thought, and channeled a thin flow of Air that flicked
Nynaeve&rsquo;s earlobe like a snapping finger. The woman clapped a
hand to her ear and glowered, but Elayne simply turned coolly back
to Master Cauthon and waited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you, too,&rdquo; Nynaeve mumbled sullenly at last. &ldquo;From the heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne rolled her eyes in spite of herself. Well, he
had asked them to speak more softly. And he did seem to hear.
Strangely, he shrugged with embarrassment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that. It was nothing. Likely thing, you&rsquo;d
have gotten yourself free in another tick without me.&rdquo; His head
sank to his hands, and he pressed the damp cloth to his eyes once
more. &ldquo;On your way out, would you ask Caira to bring me some
wine-punch? A slender girl, pretty, with a warm eye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne quivered. <em>Nothing?</em> The man <em>demanded</em> an apology, she <em>humbled</em> herself to give it,
and now it was <em>nothing</em>? He was not deserving of sympathy
or pity! She still held <em>saidar</em>, and she considered
thumping him with a much thicker flow than she had used on Nynaeve.
Not that that would do any good so long as he wore the foxhead.
Then again, it hung loose, not touching him. Did it offer the same
protection when it was not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?</p>

<p>Nynaeve ended her speculation by lunging for him,
fingers clawed. Elayne managed to put herself between them and
seize the other woman by the shoulders. For a stretched moment they
stood nose-to-nose except for the difference in their heights; with
a grimace, Nynaeve finally relaxed, and Elayne felt it was safe to
release her.</p>

<p>The man still had his head bowed, all unaware.
Whether the medallion protected him or not, she could snatch his
bowstave from the corner and beat him till he howled. She felt heat
rise in her face: She had stopped Nynaeve from ruining everything,
only to think of ruining it herself. Worse, by the smirky,
self-satisfied little smile the other woman gave her, she knew very
well what had been in her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is more, Master Cauthon,&rdquo; she announced,
squaring her shoulders. The smile vanished from Nynaeve&rsquo;s
face. &ldquo;We also wish to apologize for delaying so long in giving you
your much deserved thanks. And we apologize&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;humbly&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She
stumbled a little on that. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;for the way we have treated you
since.&rdquo; Nynaeve stretched out a beseeching hand that she ignored. &ldquo;To show the depth of our regret, we undertake the following
promises.&rdquo; Aviendha had said an apology was only a beginning. &ldquo;We
will not belittle or demean you in any way, nor shout at you for
any reason, nor&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;nor attempt to give you orders.&rdquo; Nynaeve
winced. Elayne&rsquo;s mouth tightened too, but she did not stop. &ldquo;Recognizing your due concern for our safety, we will not leave the
palace without telling you where we are going, and we will listen
to your advice.&rdquo; Light, she had no wish to be Aiel, no wish to do
any of this, but she wanted Aviendha&rsquo;s respect. &ldquo;If you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;if you decide that we are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Not that she had any intention of
becoming a sister-wife&mdash;the very <em>idea</em> was indecent!&mdash;but she did like her. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;are putting ourselves in
needless danger&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; It was not Aviendha&rsquo;s fault that Rand
had caught both their hearts. And Min&rsquo;s as well. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;we
will accept bodyguards of your choosing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Fate or <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> or whatever, what was, was. She loved both women
like sisters. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and keep them with us as long as possible.&rdquo;
<em>Burn</em> the man for doing this to her! It was not Mat Cauthon
she meant. &ldquo;This I swear by the Lion Throne of Andor.&rdquo; She breathed
in as if she had run a mile. Nynaeve wore a face like a cornered
badger.</p>

<p>His head swiveled toward them ever so slowly, and he
lowered the cloth just enough to expose one red-streaked eye. &ldquo;You
sound like you have an iron rod down your throat, my Lady,&rdquo; he said
mockingly. &ldquo;You have my permission to call me Mat.&rdquo; Odious man! He
would not know civility if it bit him on the nose! That sanguine
eye slanted toward her. &ldquo;What about you, Nynaeve? I heard a lot of &lsquo;we&rsquo; from her, but not a word from you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t shout at you,&rdquo; Nynaeve shouted. &ldquo;And
all the rest, too. I promise, you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&rdquo; She gobbled on
the edge of swallowing her tongue as she realized she could not
call him one of the names he warranted without breaking the promise
already. And yet, the effect of her shout was most gratifying.</p>

<p>With a cry, he shuddered and dropped the cloth,
clutched his head with both hands. His eyes bulged. &ldquo;Flaming dice,&rdquo;
he whimpered, or something very like. It suddenly struck Elayne
that he would be a very good source of pithy language. Stablemen
and the like always seemed to scrape their tongues clean the moment
they saw her. Of course, she had promised herself to civilize him,
to make him useful to Rand, but that need not interfere too much
with his language. In fact, she realized there was a good deal she
had <em>not</em> promised not to do. Pointing that out should
settle Nynaeve considerably.</p>

<p>After a long moment, he spoke in a hollow voice. &ldquo;Thank you, Nynaeve.&rdquo; He paused to swallow hard. &ldquo;I thought you two
must be somebody else in disguise, there for a bit. Since I still
seem to be alive, we might as well take care of the rest of it. I
seem to recall that Birgitte said you wanted me to find something
for you. What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t find it,&rdquo; Nynaeve told him in a firm
voice. Well, perhaps more hard than firm, but Elayne did not think
of calling her down. He merited every wince. &ldquo;You will accompany
us, and we will find it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Backtracking already, Nynaeve?&rdquo; Somehow, he managed
a derisive sneer, especially hideous with his eyes. &ldquo;You just
finished promising to do as I say. If you want a tame <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> on a leash, go ask Rand or Perrin and see what
answer you get.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We promised no such thing, Matrim Cauthon,&rdquo; Nynaeve
snapped, going up on her toes. &ldquo;I promised no such thing!&rdquo; She
looked about to fling herself at him again. Even her braid seemed
to bristle.</p>

<p>Elayne kept a better rein on her temper. They would
get nowhere bludgeoning him. &ldquo;We will <em>listen</em> to your
advice, and accept it if it is reasonable, Master&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Mat,&rdquo; she
chided gently. Surely he could not really believe they had promised
to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Looking at him, though, she saw that he did. Oh, Light!
Nynaeve was right. He <em>was</em> going to be trouble.</p>

<p>She held that rein firmly. Channeling again, she
lifted his coat from the chair to a proper place on one of the pegs
on the wall so she could sit, back straight, arranging her skirts
carefully. Keeping her promises to Master Cauthon&mdash;Mat&mdash;and to herself was going to be difficult, but nothing he said or
did could touch her. Nynaeve eyed the only other place to sit, a
low carved wooden footstool, and remained standing. One hand moved
toward her braid, before she folded her arms. Her foot tapped
ominously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Atha&rsquo;an Miere call it the Bowl of the
Winds, Master&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Mat. It is a <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the end, a light of excitement shone through his
sickliness. &ldquo;Now, that would be a thing to find,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;In
the Rahad.&rdquo; He shook his head, and flinched. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you
this now. Neither of you is setting foot on the other side of the
river without four or five of my Redarms each. Not outside the
palace, for that matter. Did Birgitte tell you about the note that
was stuffed in my coat? I&rsquo;m sure I told her. And there&rsquo;s
Carridin and his Darkfriends; you can&rsquo;t tell me he isn&rsquo;t
up to something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any sister who supports Egwene as Amyrlin is in
danger from the Tower.&rdquo; Bodyguards everywhere? Light! A dangerous
light shone in Nynaeve&rsquo;s eyes, and her foot tapped faster. &ldquo;We
cannot hide, Mast&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Mat, and we will not. Jaichim Carridin will
be taken care of in due course.&rdquo; They had not promised to tell him
everything, and they could not let him be diverted. &ldquo;There are more
important matters afoot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Due course?&rdquo; he began, voice rising in disbelief,
but Nynaeve cut him short.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four or five each?&rdquo; she said sourly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
ridic&mdash;&rdquo; Her eyes shut for a moment, and her tone became
milder. Slightly milder. &ldquo;I mean to say, it isn&rsquo;t sensible.
Elayne and me, Birgitte and Aviendha. You don&rsquo;t have that many
soldiers. Anyway, all we really need is you.&rdquo; That last came out as
though dragged. It was much too much an admission.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Birgitte and Aviendha don&rsquo;t need minders,&rdquo; he
said absently. &ldquo;I suppose this Bowl of the Winds is more important
than Carridin, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t seem right, letting
Darkfriends walk loose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slowly Nynaeve&rsquo;s face turned purple. Elayne
checked her own in the stand-mirror, relieved to see she was
maintaining her composure. On the outside, anyway. The man was
reprehensible! Minders? She was not sure which would be worse: that
he had flung that offhand insult on purpose, or that he had done so
without realizing. She eyed herself in the mirror again and lowered
her chin a trifle. Minders! She was poise itself.</p>

<p>He studied them with those bloodshot eyes, but saw
nothing, apparently. &ldquo;Was that all Birgitte told you?&rdquo; he asked,
and Nynaeve snapped back, &ldquo;That was quite enough, I&rsquo;d think,
even for you.&rdquo; Inexplicably, he looked surprised, and quite
pleased.</p>

<p>Nynaeve gave a start, then folded her arms around
herself tighter. &ldquo;Since you&rsquo;re in no condition to go anywhere
with us now&mdash;don&rsquo;t scowl at me, Mat Cauthon; that
isn&rsquo;t demeaning, it&rsquo;s simple truth!&mdash;you can spend
the morning moving yourself into the palace. And you needn&rsquo;t
think we&rsquo;ll help carry your things. I didn&rsquo;t promise to
be a pack-horse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Wandering Woman is plenty good enough,&rdquo; he began
angrily, then stopped, a wondering expression spreading over his
face. A horrified expression, Elayne would have said. That should
teach him to growl when he had a head like a melon. At least, that
was what hers had felt like, the time she drank too much. Of course
he would not learn from it. Men kept sticking their hands in the
fire thinking this time it would not burn, so Lini always said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can hardly expect we&rsquo;ll find the Bowl the
first time we try,&rdquo; Nynaeve went on, &ldquo;<em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> or no.
Going out each day will be much simpler if you don&rsquo;t have to
come across the square.&rdquo; If they did not have to wait for him every
morning, was what she meant. According to her, drunkenness was not
the only excuse he could find for lying in bed till all hours, far
from it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; Elayne added, &ldquo;that way, you can keep an
eye on us.&rdquo; Nynaeve made a sound in her throat, very close to a
groan. Did she not see that he must be enticed? It was not as if
she had promised to actually allow him to keep an eye on them.</p>

<p>He seemed not to have heard her or Nynaeve. Haggard
eyes stared right through her. &ldquo;Why did they bloody well have to
stop now?&rdquo; he moaned, so softly she barely heard. What under the
Light did he mean by that?</p>

<p>&ldquo;The rooms are fit for a king, Master&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Mat.
Tylin herself chose them, just down from her own. She has taken a
very personal interest. Mat, you wouldn&rsquo;t have us offend the
Queen, would you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>One look at his face, and Elayne hurriedly channeled
to push open the window and empty the washbasin through it. If she
had ever seen a man about to lose the contents of his stomach, he
was staring red-eyed at her right that minute.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you&rsquo;re making such a
fuss,&rdquo; she said. Actually, she supposed she did. Some of the
serving women here probably let him paw them, but she doubted many
in the palace would, if any. He would not be able to drink and
gamble his nights away, either. Tylin surely would not allow a bad
example for Beslan. &ldquo;We all must make sacrifices.&rdquo; With an effort
she stopped there, not telling him that his was small and only
right, theirs monstrous and unjust, no matter what Aviendha said.
Nynaeve had certainly railed against <em>any</em> sacrifice.</p>

<p>He put his head in his hands again, making strangled
noises while his shoulders shook. He was laughing! She hefted the
basin on a flow of Air, considering hitting him with it. When he
raised his eyes again, though, he looked outraged for some reason. &ldquo;Sacrifices?&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;If I asked you to make the same,
you&rsquo;d box every ear in sight and pull the roof down on my
head!&rdquo; Could he still be drunk?</p>

<p>She decided to ignore his frightful glare. &ldquo;Speaking
of your head, if you would like Healing, I&rsquo;m sure Nynaeve
would oblige.&rdquo; If she had ever been angry enough to channel, she
was now.</p>

<p>Nynaeve gave a small jerk and glanced at her from the
corner of one eye. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said hurriedly. &ldquo;If you want.&rdquo;
The color in her cheeks confirmed all of Elayne&rsquo;s suspicions
about that morning.</p>

<p>Gracious as ever, he sneered. &ldquo;You just forget my
head. I do very well without Aes Sedai.&rdquo; And then, just to confuse
matters she was sure, he added in a hesitant voice, &ldquo;I thank you
for asking, though.&rdquo; Almost as if he meant it!</p>

<p>Elayne managed not to gape. Her knowledge of men was
limited to Rand and what Lini and her mother had told her. Was Rand
going to be as confusing as Mat Cauthon?</p>

<p>Last thing before going, she remembered to secure a
promise that he would start moving to the palace immediately. He
kept his word once given, so Nynaeve had made clear, however
reluctantly, but leave one crack, and he could find a hundred ways
to slip through. <em>That</em> she had been all too eager to
emphasize. He gave his promise with a bleak, resentful grimace; or
maybe that was just his eyes again. When she set the basin down at
his feet, he actually looked grateful. She would not feel sympathy.
She would not.</p>

<p>Once back in the corridor, with the door to
Mat&rsquo;s room closed, Nynaeve shook her fist at the ceiling. &ldquo;That man could try the patience of a stone! I&rsquo;m glad he wants
to cuddle with his head! Do you hear me? Glad! He will make
trouble. He will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You two will make more trouble for him than he ever
could.&rdquo; The speaker stalked down the hall toward them, a woman with
a touch of gray in her hair, a strong face and a commanding voice.
She also wore a frown little short of a scowl. Despite the marriage
knife hanging into her cleavage, she was too fair for an Ebou Dari. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t believe it when Caira told me. I doubt I&rsquo;ve
ever seen so much foolishness poured into just two dresses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne eyed the woman up and down. Not even as a
novice had she gotten used to being addressed in that tone. &ldquo;And
who might you be, my good woman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might be and am Setalle Anan, the owner of this
inn, child&rdquo; was the dry reply, and with that, the woman flung open
a door across the hallway, seized them each by an arm, and hustled
them through so fast Elayne thought her slippers had left the
floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem under some misapprehension, Mistress Anan,&rdquo;
she said coolly as the woman released them to shut the door.</p>

<p>Nynaeve was in no mood for niceties. Holding her hand
so her Great Serpent ring was plain, she said heatedly, &ldquo;Now, you
look here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very pretty,&rdquo; the woman said, and pushed each of
them so hard they found themselves sitting side-by-side on the bed.
Elayne&rsquo;s eyes popped in disbelief. This Anan woman confronted
them, grim-faced, fists on her hips, for all the world like a
mother about to castigate her daughters. &ldquo;Flaunting that just shows
how silly you are. That young man will dandle you on his knee&mdash;one on each, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder, if you allow&mdash;he&rsquo;ll take a few kisses and as much else as you&rsquo;re
willing to give, but he won&rsquo;t harm you. You can harm him,
though, if you keep on with this.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Harm</em> him? The woman thought they&mdash;she
thought he had <em>dandled</em>&mdash;she thought&mdash;Elayne
did not know whether to laugh or cry, but she stood up,
straightening her skirts. &ldquo;As I said, Mistress Anan, you are under
a misapprehension.&rdquo; Her voice became smoother as she went on,
confusion giving way to calm. &ldquo;I am Elayne Trakand, Daughter-Heir
of Andor and Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah. I don&rsquo;t know what
you think&mdash;&rdquo; Her eyes nearly crossed as Mistress Anan pushed
a finger to the tip of her nose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elayne, if that is your name, all that keeps me from
dragging you down to the kitchen and washing your mouth out, yours
and that other foolish girl&rsquo;s there, is the possibility that
you actually can channel somewhat. Or are you silly enough to wear
that ring when you can&rsquo;t even do that? I warn you, it will
make no difference to the sisters over in the Tarasin Palace. Do
you even know about them? If you do, frankly, you are not foolish,
you&rsquo;re blind stupid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s temper grew by the word. Foolish girl?
Blind stupid? She would not put up with it, especially not right
after being forced to crawl to Mat Cauthon. Dandle? Mat Cauthon?
She maintained her outward composure, though, but not so
Nynaeve.</p>

<p>She glared in a fury, and the glow of <em>saidar</em>
enveloped her as she bounded to her feet. Flows of Air wrapped
mistress Anan from shoulders to ankles, crushing her skirts and
petticoats against her legs, just short of tight enough to topple
her. &ldquo;I happen to be one of those sisters in the palace. Nynaeve
al&rsquo;Meara of the Yellow Ajah, to be exact. Now would you like me
to carry you down to the kitchens? I know something of how to wash
out a mouth.&rdquo; Elayne stepped away from the innkeeper&rsquo;s
outstretched arm.</p>

<p>The woman had to feel the pressure of the flows, and
even a half-wit would have known what those invisible bonds must
be, yet she did not blink! Her green-flecked eyes narrowed, no
more. &ldquo;So one of you can channel, at least,&rdquo; she said calmly. &ldquo;I
should let you drag me downstairs, child. Whatever you do to me,
you would be in the hands of real Aes Sedai by noon; I&rsquo;ll
wager that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear me?&rdquo; Nynaeve demanded. &ldquo;I&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Anan woman did not even pause. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not
only spend the next year blubbering, you will do part of it in
front of anyone you told that you are Aes Sedai. Be sure,
they&rsquo;ll make you tell. They will turn your liver to water. I
should let you go blundering on your way, or else run across to the
palace as soon as you loose me. The only reason I don&rsquo;t is
that they&rsquo;ll make an example of Lord Mat nearly as much as of
you, if they even suspect he&rsquo;s helped you, and as I said, I
like the young man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you&mdash;&rdquo; Nynaeve tried again,
but <em>still</em> the innkeeper gave her no chance to tell
anything. Tied like a bundle, the woman was a boulder rolling
downhill. She was the whole hillside falling, flattening whatever
lay in its path.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trying to keep up the lie does no good, Nynaeve. You
look to be, oh, twenty-one give or take a year, so you might be as
much as ten years older if you&rsquo;ve already reached the slowing.
You might even have worn the shawl four or five years. Except for
one thing.&rdquo; Her head, the only part of her she could move, swiveled
toward Elayne. &ldquo;You, child, aren&rsquo;t old enough to have slowed
yet, and no woman has ever worn the shawl as young as you. Never in
the history of the Tower. If you ever were in the Tower, I&rsquo;ll
wager you wore white and squeaked every time the Mistress of
Novices glanced your way. You had some goldsmith make that ring for
you&mdash;there are some fool enough, I hear&mdash;or maybe
Nynaeve stole it for you, if she has any right to hers. Either way,
since you can&rsquo;t be a sister, neither can she. No Aes Sedai
would travel with a woman who was pretending.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne frowned, not noticing that she was chewing her
lower lip. Slowed. Slowing. How did an innkeeper in Ebou Dar know
those words? Maybe Setalle Anan had gone to the Tower as a girl,
though she would not have remained long, since she clearly could
not channel. Elayne would have known even if her ability had been
as small as her own mother&rsquo;s, and Morgase Trakand had had an
ability so small she would have been sent away in a matter of weeks
probably, had she not been heir to a strong House.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Release her, Nynaeve,&rdquo; she said, smiling. She truly
did feel more well-disposed toward the woman, now. It must have
been terrible to make that journey to Tar Valon only to be turned
away. There was no reason the woman <em>had</em> to believe them&mdash;something tickled at that, but she could not say what&mdash;no reason at all, but if she had made the trip to Tar Valon, maybe
she would walk across the Mol Hara. Merilille, or any of the other
sisters, could set her straight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Release her?&rdquo; Nynaeve yelped. &ldquo;Elayne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Release her. Mistress Anan, I see the only way to
convince you is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Amyrlin Seat and three Sitters couldn&rsquo;t
convince me, child.&rdquo; Light, did she ever let anyone finish a
sentence? &ldquo;Now, I don&rsquo;t have time for any more games. I can
help the pair of you. I know those who can, anyway, some women who
take in strays. You can thank Lord Mat that I&rsquo;m willing to
take you to them, but I must know. Were you ever in the Tower, or
are you wilders? If you were there, were you put out, or did you
run away? The truth. They handle each in a different way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne shrugged. They had done what they came for;
she was more than ready to stop wasting time and get on with what
needed doing next. &ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t be convinced, then
that&rsquo;s all there is to it. Nynaeve? It is past time we were on
our way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The flows around the innkeeper vanished, and the glow
around Nynaeve too, but Nynaeve stood there watching the woman
warily, hopefully. She wet her lips. &ldquo;You know a group of women who
can help us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve?&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need any help.
We <em>are</em> Aes Sedai, remember?&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a wry glance in her direction, Mistress Anan
gave her skirts a shake to straighten them and bent to smooth her
exposed petticoats. Her real attention was on Nynaeve; Elayne had
never felt so completely shunted aside in her life. &ldquo;I know a few
women who take in the occasional wilder or runaway or woman who
failed her test for Accepted or the shawl. There must be at least
fifty of them, altogether, though the number changes. They can help
you find a life without the risk of a real sister making you wish
she&rsquo;d just skin you and be done. Now, don&rsquo;t lie to me.
Were you ever in the Tower? If you&rsquo;ve run away, you might as
well decide to go back. The Tower managed to find most runaways
even during the War of the Hundred Years, so you needn&rsquo;t think
this little bother now will stop them. In truth, my suggestion then
would be to go across the square and throw yourself on a
sister&rsquo;s mercy. It will be a small mercy, I&rsquo;m afraid, but
you can believe me, it&rsquo;s more than you&rsquo;ll find if they
have to drag you back. You won&rsquo;t even think of so much as
leaving the Tower <em>grounds</em> without permission after
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve drew a deep breath. &ldquo;We were told to leave
the Tower, Mistress Anan. I will swear to that however you
ask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne stared in disbelief. &ldquo;Nynaeve, what are you
<em>saying</em>? Mistress Anan, we <em>are</em> Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Anan woman laughed. &ldquo;Child, let me talk with
Nynaeve, who at least seems old enough to have sense. You tell the
Circle that, and they will not take it kindly! They won&rsquo;t care
you can channel; they can, too, and they&rsquo;ll smack your bottom
or toss you out in the street on your nose if you play the
fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is this <em>Circle</em>?&rdquo; Elayne demanded. &ldquo;We
<em>are</em> Aes Sedai. You come across to the Tarasin Palace, and
you will see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep her in hand,&rdquo; Nynaeve had the gall to
say, all the while frowning and grimacing at Elayne as if she were
the one who had gone mad.</p>

<p>The Anan woman merely nodded. &ldquo;Good. Now take off
those rings and put them away. The Circle doesn&rsquo;t allow that
sort of pretending. They&rsquo;ll have them melted down to give you
a start. Though by the look of your dresses, you have coin. If you
stole it, don&rsquo;t let Reanne know. One of the first rules
you&rsquo;ll have to learn is, don&rsquo;t steal even if you are
starving. They don&rsquo;t want to draw attention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne made a fist and thrust it behind her back. And
watched Nynaeve meekly slip her ring off and tuck it into her belt
pouch. Nynaeve, who howled every time Merilille or Adeleas or any
of them forgot she was a full sister!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trust me, Elayne,&rdquo; Nynaeve said.</p>

<p>Which Elayne would have had an easier time of if she
had any notion what the woman was up to. Still, she did trust her.
Mostly. &ldquo;A small sacrifice,&rdquo; she muttered. Aes Sedai did go without
their rings when the need arose, and she had too, while passing for
a sister, but it was hers by right, now. Removing that band of gold
almost hurt physically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Talk to your friend, child,&rdquo; the Anan woman told
Nynaeve impatiently. &ldquo;Reanne Corly won&rsquo;t put up with all this
sulky pouting, and if you make me waste my morning for nothing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Come along, come along. It&rsquo;s lucky for you I like Lord
Mat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne held on to cool composure by a fingernail.
Sulky pouting? Sulky <em>pouting</em>! When she had the chance, she
was going to kick Nynaeve where it hurt!</p>
