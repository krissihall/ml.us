<h4><em>Swovan Night</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">N</span>ight
came slowly over Ebou Dar, the glow of the
white buildings resisting darkness. Small knots and bunches of
Swovan Night revelers with little sprigs of evergreen in their hair
danced in the streets beneath a bright three-quarter moon, few
carrying so much as a lantern as they gamboled to the music of
flutes and drums and horns that drifted from inns and palaces,
dancing their way from one set of festivities to another, but for
the most part the streets lay empty. A distant dog barked, and
another, closer, answered furiously until it suddenly yelped and
fell silent.</p>

<p>Balanced on his toes, Mat listened, eyes searching
the moonshadows. Only a cat moved, slinking along the street. The
slap of running bare feet faded. The owner of one pair should be
staggering, and the other bleeding. As he bent, his foot kicked a
club as long as his arm on the paving stones; heavy brass studs
shone in the moonlight. That would have broken his skull for sure.
Shaking his head, he wiped his knife on the ragged coat worn by the
man at his feet. Open eyes stared at the night sky from a dirty,
creased face. A beggar, by the look and smell of him. Mat had not
heard of beggars attacking people, but maybe times were harder than
he thought. A large jute sack lay near one outstretched hand. The
fellows certainly had been optimistic about what they would find in
his pockets. The thing could have covered him from head to
knees.</p>

<p>To the north, above the city, light suddenly burst in
the sky with a hollow boom as glittering streaks of green expanded
in a ball, and then another eruption showered red sparkles through
the first, then a blue, and a yellow. Illuminators&rsquo;
nightflowers, not as spectacular as they would have been in a
moonless, cloudy sky, yet still they took his breath. He could
watch fireworks till he fell over from hunger. Nalesean had spoken
of an Illuminator&mdash;Light, was that only this morning?&mdash;but no more nightflowers came. When Illuminators made the sky
bloom, as they said, they planted more than four flowers. Plainly
someone with coin had made a purchase for Swovan Night. He wished
he knew who. An Illuminator who would sell nightflowers would sell
more than that.</p>

<p>Slipping the knife back up his sleeve, he gathered
his hat from the pavement and walked away hurriedly, his boots
echoing, a sound empty as the street. Most shuttered windows here
showed not a glimmer of light. A better place for murder probably
could not be found in the city. The entire encounter with the three
beggars had lasted only a minute or two and had been seen by no
one. In this city, you could find three or four fights in a day if
you were not careful, but the odds of facing two sets of robbers in
one day seemed about as great as the odds of the Civil Guard
refusing a bribe. What was happening to his luck? If only those
bloody dice would stop rolling in his head. He did not run, but he
did not dawdle either, one hand on a hilt beneath his coat and an
eye open for anyone moving in the shadows. He saw nothing but a few
clumps of people cavorting along the street, though.</p>

<p>In the common room of The Wandering Woman, the tables
had been cleared away except for a few near the walls. The flutists
and the drummer made shrill music for four laughing lines of people
doing what appeared to be half pattern-dance and half jig.
Watching, he copied a step. Outland merchants in fine woolens
leaped right along with locals in brocaded silk vests or those
useless coats slung on their shoulders. He marked out two of the
merchants for the way they moved, one slender and one not, yet both
with a light grace, and several local women wearing their best, the
deep necklines outlined by a little lace or a great deal of
embroidery, but none in silk. Not that he would refuse to dance
with a woman in silk, of course&mdash;he had never turned down a
dance with any woman of any age or station&mdash;but the rich were
in the palaces tonight, or the homes of the wealthier merchants and
moneylenders. Those folk near the walls, catching their breath for
the next dance, had their faces buried in mugs often as not, or
were snatching fresh mugs from trays carried by scurrying serving
women. Mistress Anan likely would sell as much wine tonight as in
an ordinary week. Ale, too; the local folk must have no taste to
their tongues.</p>

<p>Trying another step of the dance, he caught Caira as
she tried to hurry by with a tray, pitching his voice loud above
the music to ask a few questions and finishing with an order for
his dinner, gilded fish, a tangy dish that Mistress Anan&rsquo;s
cook prepared to perfection. A man needed his strength to keep up
in the dance.</p>

<p>Caira flashed a sultry smile at a fellow in a yellow
vest who grabbed a mug from her tray and dropped his coin on it,
but for once she had no smile for Mat. In fact, she managed to
compress her mouth to a thin line, no small feat. &ldquo;Your little
rabbit, am I?&rdquo; With a telling sniff, she went on impatiently. &ldquo;The
boy is tucked into his bed, where he should be, and I don&rsquo;t
know where Lord Nalesean is, or Harnan, or Master Vanin, or anybody
else. And Cook said she won&rsquo;t fix anything but soup and bread
for those as are drowning their tongues in wine. Though why my Lord
wants gilded fish when he has a gilded woman waiting in his room,
I&rsquo;m sure I couldn&rsquo;t say. If my Lord will excuse me, some
people need to work for their crust.&rdquo; She swooped away, proffering
her tray and smiling fit to split her face at every man in
sight.</p>

<p>Mat frowned after her. A gilded woman? In his room?
The chest of gold rested now in a small hollow beneath the kitchen
floor, in front of one of the stoves, but the dice in his head
drummed like thunder suddenly.</p>

<p>The sounds of merriment faded a little as he slowly
climbed the stairs. In front of his door, he paused, listening to
the dice. Two attempts to rob him so far today. Twice his skull
could have been broken. He was sure that Darkfriend had not seen
him, and no one could call her gilded, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He fingered a hilt
under his coat, then took his hand away as a woman flared in his
thoughts, a tall woman falling with the hilt of a knife protruding
between her breasts. His knife. Luck would just have to be with
him. Sighing, he pushed open the door.</p>

<p>The Hunter that Elayne had made her Warder turned,
hefting his unstrung Two Rivers bow, her golden braid drawn over
her shoulder. Her blue eyes fastened on him purposefully, and her
face fixed itself in determination. She looked ready to drub him
with the bow if she did not get what she wanted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If this is about Olver,&rdquo; he began, and suddenly a
twist of memory unfolded, a mist thinned over one day, one hour in
his life.</p>

<p><em>There was no hope, with Seanchan to the west and
Whitecloaks to the east, no hope and only one chance, so he raised
the curled Horn and blew, not really knowing what to expect. The
sound came golden as the Horn, so sweet he did not know whether to
laugh or cry. It echoed, and the earth and heavens seemed to sing.
While that one pure note hung in the air, a fog began to rise,
appearing from nowhere, thin wisps, thickening, billowing higher,
until all was obscured as if clouds covered the land. And down the
clouds they rode, as though down a mountainside, the dead heroes of
legend, bound to be called back by the Horn of Valere. Artur
Hawkwing himself led, tall and hook-nosed, and behind came the
rest, little more than a hundred. So few, but all those the Wheel
would spin out again and again to guide the Pattern, to make legend
and myth. Mikel of the Pure Heart, and Shivan the Hunter behind his
black mask. He was said to herald the end of Ages, the destruction
of what had been and the birth of what was to be, he and his sister
Calian, called the Chooser, who rode red-masked at his side.
Amaresu, with the Sword of the Sun glowing in her hands, and
Paedrig, the golden-tongued peacemaker, and there, carrying the
silver bow with which she never missed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>He pushed the door shut trying to lean against it. He
felt dizzy, dazed. &ldquo;You are she. Birgitte, for true. Burn my bones
to ash, it&rsquo;s impossible. How? How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman of legend gave a resigned sigh and propped
his bow back in the corner next to his spear. &ldquo;I was ripped out
untimely, Hornsounder, cast out by Moghedien to die and saved by
Elayne&rsquo;s bonding.&rdquo; She spoke slowly, studying him as if to be
sure he understood. &ldquo;I feared you might remember who I used to
be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still feeling hit between the eyes, he flung himself
scowling into the armchair beside his table. Who she used to be,
indeed. Fists on hips, she confronted him challengingly, no whit
different from the Birgitte he had seen ride out of the sky. Even
her clothes were the same, though this short coat was red and the
wide trousers yellow. &ldquo;Elayne and Nynaeve know and kept it from me,
true? I weary of secrets, Birgitte, and they harbor secrets as a
grain barn harbors rats. They&rsquo;ve become Aes Sedai, eyes and
hearts. Even Nynaeve is twice a stranger, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have your own secrets.&rdquo; Folding her arms under
her breasts, she sat on the foot of his bed. The way she looked at
him, you would have thought he was a tavern puzzle. &ldquo;For one,
you&rsquo;ve not told them you blew the Horn of Valere. The smallest
of your secrets from them, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat blinked. He had assumed they had told her. After
all, she was Birgitte. &ldquo;What secrets do I have? Those women know my
toenails and dreams.&rdquo; She was Birgitte. Of course. He leaned
forward. &ldquo;Make them see reason. You&rsquo;re Birgitte Silverbow. You
can make them do as you say. This city has a pit-trap at every
crossing, and I fear the stakes grow sharper by the day. Make them
come away before it&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laughed. Put a hand over her mouth and laughed! &ldquo;You have the wrong end, Hornsounder. I do not command them. I am
Elayne&rsquo;s Warder. I obey.&rdquo; Her smile became rueful. &ldquo;Birgitte
Silverbow. Faith of the Light, I&rsquo;m not sure I still am that
woman. So much of what I was and knew has faded like mist beneath
the summer sun since my strange new birth. I&rsquo;m no hero now,
only another woman to make my way. And as for your secrets. What
language do we speak, Hornsounder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He opened his mouth&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and stopped, really hearing
what she had just asked. <em>Nosane iro gavane domorakoshi,
Diynen&rsquo;d&rsquo;ma&rsquo;purvene?</em> Speak we what language,
Sounder of the Horn? The hair on his neck tried to stand. &ldquo;The old
blood,&rdquo; he said carefully. Not in the Old Tongue. &ldquo;An Aes Sedai
once told me the old blood runs strong in&mdash;What are you
bloody well laughing at now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, Mat,&rdquo; she managed while trying not to double
over. At least she was not speaking the Old Tongue any more either.
She knuckled a tear from the corner of her eye. &ldquo;Some people speak
a few words, a phrase or two, because of the old blood. Usually
without understanding what they say, or not quite. But you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;One sentence, you&rsquo;re an Eharoni High Prince and the next a
First Lord of Manetheren, accent and idiom perfect. No, don&rsquo;t
worry. Your secret is safe with me.&rdquo; She hesitated. &ldquo;Is mine with
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He waved a hand, still too flabbergasted to be
offended. &ldquo;Do I look like my tongue flaps?&rdquo; he muttered. Birgitte!
In the flesh! &ldquo;Burn me, I could use a drink.&rdquo; Before that was out
of his mouth he knew it was the wrong thing to say. Women never&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That sounds the right notion to me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
could use a pitcher of wine, myself. Blood and ashes, when I saw
you&rsquo;d recognized me, I nearly swallowed my tongue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sat up straight as if he had been jerked,
staring.</p>

<p>She met his gaze with a merry twinkle and a grin. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s enough noise in the common room, we could talk
without being overheard. Besides, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind sitting and
looking a bit. Elayne preaches like a Tovan councilor if I ogle a
man for longer than a heartbeat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He nodded before he thought. Other men&rsquo;s memories
told him Tovans were a stark and disapproving people, abstemious to
the point of pain; at least they had been, a thousand years gone
and more. He was not sure whether to laugh or groan. On the one
hand, a chance to talk with Birgitte&mdash;Birgitte! he
doubted he would ever get over the shock&mdash;but on the other,
he doubted he would be able to hear the music downstairs for the
noise of those dice rattling in his skull. She must be a key to it,
somehow. A man with any brains would climb out the window right
now. &ldquo;A pitcher or two sounds fine to me,&rdquo; he told her.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">A stiff salt breeze up from the bay carried a touch
of coolness, for a wonder, but the night felt oppressive to
Nynaeve. Music and snatches of laughter drifted into the palace,
and faintly from within as well. She had been invited to the ball
by Tylin herself, and Elayne and Aviendha too, but all declined,
with varying degrees of politeness. Aviendha had said there was
only one dance she was willing to do with wetlander men, which made
Tylin blink uncertainly. For herself, Nynaeve would have liked to
go&mdash;only a fool passed up any chance to dance&mdash;yet she
knew if she had, she would have done exactly what she was doing,
sat somewhere worrying and trying not to chew her knuckle to a
nub.</p>

<p>So there they all were, closeted in their apartments
with Thom and Juilin, anxious as caged cats, while everyone else in
Ebou Dar made merry. Well, she was, anyway. What could be keeping
Birgitte? How long did it take to tell a man to present himself
first thing in the morning? Light, the whole effort was useless,
and it was long past time for bed. Long past. If she could only
sleep, she could put away memories of the morning&rsquo;s horrible
journeys by boat. Worst of all, her weather sense told her a storm
was on the way, told her the wind should be howling outside and the
rain sheeting down so thick no one could see ten feet. It had taken
her some time to understand about the times she Listened to the
Wind and seemed to hear lies. At least, she thought she understood.
Another kind of storm was coming, not wind or rain. She had no
proof, but she would eat her slippers if Mat Cauthon was not part
of it somehow. She wanted to sleep for a month, a year, to forget
worries until Lan wakened her with a kiss like the Sun King with
Talia. Which was ridiculous, of course; that was only a story, and
a very improper one at that, and anyway, she was not about to
become any man&rsquo;s pet, not even Lan&rsquo;s. She would find him,
though, somehow, and bond him hers. She would&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Light! If she
had not thought the others would stare at her, she would have paced
the soles out of her slippers!</p>

<p>The hours wore on. She read and re-read the short
letter Mat had left with Tylin. Aviendha sat quietly beside her
high-backed chair, cross-legged on the pale green floor tiles as
usual, an ornately gilded leather-bound copy of <em>The Travels of
Jain Farstrider</em> open on her knees. No anxiety there, not to
see, but then the woman would not turn a hair if someone stuffed a
viper down her dress. Since returning to the palace she had donned
the intricate silver necklace she wore nearly day and night. Except
on the boat trip; she had said she did not want to risk it, then.
Idly, Nynaeve wondered why she no longer wore her ivory bracelet.
There had been an overheard conversation, something about not
wearing it until Elayne had its like, which made little sense. And
mattered as little as the bracelet, of course. The letter called
from her lap.</p>

<p>The sitting-room stand-lamps made reading easy,
though Mat&rsquo;s unformed, boyish hand did present difficulties.
It was the contents that clenched Nynaeve&rsquo;s middle into
knots.</p>

<p class="note">There&rsquo;s nothing here but heat and flies, and we can find
plenty of those in Caemlyn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you didn&rsquo;t tell him anything?&rdquo; she
demanded.</p>

<p>Across the room, Juilin paused with his hand over the
stones board, giving her a look of outraged innocence. &ldquo;How often
must I say so?&rdquo; Outraged innocence was one of the things men did
best, especially when they were guilty as foxes in the henyard.
Interesting that the carving around the board&rsquo;s rim was of
foxes.</p>

<p>Thom, seated across the lapis-inlaid table from the
thief-catcher, looked as little the gleeman in his finely cut coat
of bronze wool, as he did the man who had once been Queen
Morgase&rsquo;s lover. Gnarled and white-haired, with long mustaches
and thick eyebrows, he was frustrated patience from his sharp blue
eyes to his boot soles. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see how we could have,
Nynaeve,&rdquo; he said dryly, &ldquo;given that you told us next to nothing
until tonight. You should have sent Juilin and me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve sniffed loudly. As if those two had not been
running around like chickens with their heads off ever since they
arrived, prying into her and Elayne&rsquo;s affairs on Mat&rsquo;s
say-so. Those three could not be together two minutes without
gossiping, either. Men never could. They&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The truth of it was,
she admitted reluctantly, using the men had never occurred to them. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have gone off carousing and drinking with him,&rdquo; she
muttered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me you would not.&rdquo; That must be where
Mat was, leaving Birgitte to cool her feet at the inn. That man
would find some way to set the whole scheme awry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what if they had?&rdquo; Leaning beside one of the
tall arched windows, peering out at the night through the
white-painted iron balcony, Elayne giggled. She was tapping her
foot, though how she could make out one tune from all those
floating in the darkness was a wonder. &ldquo;It is a night for&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;carousing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve frowned at her back. Elayne had been
increasingly peculiar all night. If she had not known better, she
would have suspected the other woman had been sneaking out to
snatch sips of wine. Gulps of it, actually. Even if Elayne had not
been under her eye, though, that was impossible. Each of them had
had a rather unfortunate experience with too much wine, and neither
had again let herself have more than a single cup at a time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is Jaichim Carridin who interests me,&rdquo; Aviendha
said, closing the book and setting it beside her. She refused to
consider how odd she looked, sitting on the floor in a blue silk
dress. &ldquo;Among us, Shadowrunners are killed as soon as found, and
not clan, sept, society or first-sister will raise a hand in
protest. If Jaichim Carridin is a Shadowrunner, why does Tylin
Mitsobar not kill him? Why do we not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Matters are a little more complex here,&rdquo; Nynaeve
told her, though she had wondered the same. Not why Carridin was
not killed, of course, but why he was still allowed to come and go
as he wished. She had seen him in the palace that very day, after
she had been handed Mat&rsquo;s letter, after she had told Tylin
what it contained. He had spoken with Tylin above an hour and
departed with as much honor as when he arrived. She had meant to
discuss it with Elayne, but the question of what Mat knew, and how,
kept intruding. That man would make trouble. He would, somehow.
This business was going to go wrong no matter what anyone said. Bad
weather was coming.</p>

<p>Thom cleared his throat. &ldquo;Tylin is a weak queen, and
Carridin the ambassador of a power.&rdquo; Placing a stone, he kept his
eyes on the board. He sounded as though he was thinking aloud. &ldquo;By
definition, a Whitecloak Inquisitor cannot be a Darkfriend; at
least, that&rsquo;s how it is defined in the Fortress of the Light.
If she arrests him, or even charges him, she&rsquo;ll find a
Whitecloak legion in Ebou Dar before she can blink. They might
leave her the throne, but she&rsquo;d be a puppet from then on,
strings pulled from the Dome of Truth. Aren&rsquo;t you ready to
concede yet, Juilin?&rdquo; The thief-catcher glared at him, then bent to
a furious study of the board.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not think her a coward,&rdquo; Aviendha said
disgustedly, and Thom gave her an amused smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have never faced something you could not fight,
child,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;something so strong your only choice is to
flee or be consumed alive. Try to hold judgment on Tylin till you
have.&rdquo; For some reason, Aviendha&rsquo;s face reddened. Normally,
she hid her emotions so well her face was like stone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Elayne said suddenly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find
proof even Pedron Niall must accept.&rdquo; She skipped back into the
room. No, she danced. &ldquo;We will disguise ourselves and follow
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, it was no longer Elayne standing there in a
green Ebou Dari gown, but a Domani woman in thin clinging blue.
Nynaeve leaped up before she could stop, and her mouth tightened
with exasperation at herself. Just because she could not see the
weaves at the moment was no reason to be startled by Illusion. She
darted a glance at Thom and Juilin. Even Thom&rsquo;s mouth hung
open. Unconsciously she took a firm grip on her braid. Elayne was
going to reveal everything! What was the matter with her?</p>

<p>Illusion worked best the closer you stayed to what
was there before, in shape and size at least, so bits of the Ebou
Dari dress flashed through the Domani garment as Elayne whirled to
examine herself in one of the room&rsquo;s two large mirrors. She
laughed and clapped her hands. &ldquo;Oh, he will never recognize me. Or
you, near-sister.&rdquo; Abruptly a Taraboner woman sat beside
Nynaeve&rsquo;s chair, with brown eyes and yellow braids strung with
red beads just the shade of her snug-fitting dress of folded silk.
She watched Elayne quizzically. Nynaeve&rsquo;s hand tightened on
her braid. &ldquo;And we can&rsquo;t forget you,&rdquo; Elayne babbled on. &ldquo;I
know <em>just</em> the thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This time, Nynaeve saw the glow around Elayne. She
was furious. Seeing the flows being woven about herself did not
tell her what image Elayne gave her, of course. It took looking
into one of the mirrors to do that. A Sea Folk woman stared back at
her, aghast, with a dozen begemmed rings in her ears and twice as
many golden medallions dangling from the chain running to her nose
ring. Aside from the jewelry, she wore wide trousers of brocaded
green silk and not a stitch else, the way women of the Atha&rsquo;an
Miere did out of sight of land. It was just Illusion. She was still
decently clothed under the weaving. But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Beside her reflection
she saw those of Thom and Juilin, both fighting grins.</p>

<p>A strangled squawk erupted from her throat. &ldquo;Close
your eyes!&rdquo; she shouted at the men and began leaping about, waving
her arms, anything to make her dress show through. &ldquo;Close them,
burn you!&rdquo; Oh. They had. Bristling with indignation, she stopped
capering. They were not fighting those grins anymore, though. For
that matter, Aviendha was laughing quite openly, rocking to and
fro.</p>

<p>Nynaeve gave her skirts a jerk&mdash;in the mirror,
the Sea Folk woman seemed to pluck at her trousers&mdash;and fixed
Elayne with a glare. &ldquo;Stop this, Elayne!&rdquo; The Domani woman stared
back, mouth open and eyes wide with incredulity. Only then did
Nynaeve realize how angry she was; the True Source beckoned from
just beyond the edge of sight. Embracing <em>saidar</em>, she
slammed a shield between Elayne and the Source. Or rather, she
tried to. Shielding someone who already held the Power was not easy
even when you were the stronger. Once, as a girl, she had swung
Master Luhhan&rsquo;s hammer against his anvil as hard as she could,
and the shiver of it ran all the way to her toes. This was about
twice that. &ldquo;Love of the Light, Elayne, are you drunk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The glow around the Domani woman faded away, and so
did the Domani woman. Nynaeve knew the weave was gone from around
herself, but she still glanced at the mirror and drew a relieved
breath to see Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara there in yellow-slashed
blue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Elayne said slowly. Color burned in her face,
but it was not embarrassment, or not entirely. Her chin rose, and
her voice frosted. &ldquo;<em>I</em> am not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door to the corridor banged open, and Birgitte
staggered in with a broad smile. Well, perhaps she did not quite
stagger, but she was decidedly unsteady. &ldquo;I did not expect you all
to remain awake for me,&rdquo; she said brightly. &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll be
interested to hear what I have to say. But first&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; With the
too steady steps of someone carrying considerable drink inside, she
vanished into her room.</p>

<p>Thom stared at her door with a bemused grin, Juilin
with an incredulous one. They knew who she was, the truth of it.
Elayne just glared down her nose. From Birgitte&rsquo;s bedchamber
came a splashing, as if a pitcher had been upended on the floor.
Nynaeve exchanged puzzled looks with Aviendha.</p>

<p>Birgitte reappeared with her face and hair dripping
and her coat soaked from shoulders to elbows. &ldquo;Now my wits are
clearer,&rdquo; she said, settling into one of the ball-footed chairs
with a sigh. &ldquo;That young man has a hollow leg and a hole in the
bottom of his foot. He even out-drank Beslan, and I was beginning
to think wine was water to that lad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beslan?&rdquo; Nynaeve said, her voice rising. &ldquo;Tylin&rsquo;s son? What was he doing there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you allow it, Birgitte?&rdquo; Elayne exclaimed. &ldquo;Mat Cauthon will corrupt the boy, and his mother will blame
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <em>boy</em> is the same age as you,&rdquo; Thom told
her in stuffy tones.</p>

<p>A baffled look passed between Nynaeve and Elayne.
What was his point? Everyone knew that a man did not achieve his
proper wits, such as they were, until ten years later than a
woman.</p>

<p>The puzzlement faded from Elayne&rsquo;s face,
replaced by firmness and no little anger as she focused on Birgitte
again. Words were going to be said, words both women might regret
tomorrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you and Juilin will leave us now, Thom,&rdquo; Nynaeve
said quickly. It was extremely unlikely they would see the need on
their own. &ldquo;You need your sleep to be fresh first thing in the
morning.&rdquo; They sat there, gaping at her like belled fools, so she
made her tone firmer. &ldquo;Now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This game was done twenty stones ago,&rdquo; Thom said,
glancing at the board. &ldquo;What do you say we go down to our own room
and start another? I&rsquo;ll spot you ten stones to place as you
will any time during the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten stones?&rdquo; Juilin yelped, scraping back his chair. &ldquo;Will you offer me fish broth and milk-bread, as well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They argued all the way out, but at the door, each of
them glanced back in sullen resentment. She would not put it past
them to remain awake all night just because she had sent them to
bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat won&rsquo;t corrupt Beslan,&rdquo; Birgitte said dryly
as the door closed behind the men. &ldquo;I doubt nine feather dancers
with a shipload of brandy could corrupt him. They wouldn&rsquo;t
know where to begin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve was relieved to hear it, though something was
odd about the woman&rsquo;s tone&mdash;likely the drink&mdash;but
Beslan was not at all the issue. She said so, and Elayne added, &ldquo;No, he isn&rsquo;t. You got <em>drunk</em>, Birgitte! And <em>I</em> felt it. I <em>still</em> feel tipsy if I don&rsquo;t
concentrate. The bond is <em>not</em> supposed to work that way.
Aes Sedai don&rsquo;t fall over giggling if their Warders drink too
much.&rdquo; Nynaeve threw up her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at me that way,&rdquo; Birgitte said. &ldquo;You
know more than I do. Aes Sedai and Warders have always been men and
women before. Maybe that&rsquo;s the difference. Maybe we are too
alike.&rdquo; Her grin was skewed slightly. There had not been near
enough water in that pitcher. &ldquo;That might be embarrassing, I
suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we could stay with what is important?&rdquo; Nynaeve
said tightly. &ldquo;Such as Mat?&rdquo; Elayne had her mourn open for a retort
to Birgitte, but she closed it quickly, the red spots in her cheeks
most definitely chagrin this time. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Nynaeve went on. &ldquo;Will
Mat be here in the morning, or is he in the same revolting state as
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He might come,&rdquo; Birgitte said, taking a cup of mint
tea from Aviendha, who of course sat down on the floor. Elayne
frowned at her a moment, then, of all things, folded up her legs
and sat beside her!</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, he might?&rdquo; Nynaeve demanded. She
channeled, and the chair she had been sitting in floated over to
her, and if it banged to the floor, she meant it to. Drinking too
much, sitting on the floor. What was next? &ldquo;If he expects us to
come to him on hands and knees&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Birgitte took a sip of the tea with a grateful
murmur, and oddly, when she looked at Nynaeve again, she did not
seem so intoxicated. &ldquo;I talked him out of that. I don&rsquo;t think
he was really serious. All he wants now is an apology and
thanks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s eyes popped. She had talked him <em>out</em> of that? Apologize? To Matrim Cauthon? &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; she
growled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For what?&rdquo; Elayne wanted to know, as if that
mattered. She pretended not to see Nynaeve&rsquo;s glare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Stone of Tear,&rdquo; Birgitte said, and
Nynaeve&rsquo;s head whipped around. The woman no longer sounded
intoxicated at all. &ldquo;He says he went into the Stone, him and
Juilin, to free the pair of you from a dungeon you couldn&rsquo;t
escape on your own.&rdquo; She shook her head slowly, in wonder. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know that I would have done that for anyone short of
Gaidal. Not the Stone. He says you gave him a backhanded thanks and
made him feel he ought to be grateful you didn&rsquo;t kick
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was true, in a way, but all distorted. There Mat
had been with that mocking grin of his, saying he was there to pull
their chestnuts off the fire or some such. Even then he had thought
he could tell them what to do. &ldquo;Only one of the Black sisters was
on guard in the dungeon,&rdquo; Nynaeve muttered, &ldquo;and we had taken care
of her.&rdquo; True, they hadn&rsquo;t yet been able to figure out how to
open the door, shielded. &ldquo;Be&rsquo;lal wasn&rsquo;t really interested
in us, anyway&mdash;it was just to lure Rand. Moiraine may already
have killed him, by then, for all we know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Black Ajah.&rdquo; Birgitte&rsquo;s voice was flatter
than the floor tiles. &ldquo;And one of the Forsaken. Mat never mentioned
them. You owe him thanks on your knees, Elayne. Both of you do. The
man deserves it. And Juilin, as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blood rushed to Nynaeve&rsquo;s face. He had never
mentioned&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? That despicable, despicable man! &ldquo;I will not
apologize to Matrim Cauthon, not on my deathbed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha leaned toward Elayne, touching her knee. &ldquo;Near-sister, I will say this delicately.&rdquo; She looked and sounded
about as delicate as a stone post. &ldquo;If this is true, you have <em>toh</em> toward Mat Cauthon, you and Nynaeve. And you have made it
worse since, just by the actions I have seen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Toh!</em>&rdquo; Nynaeve exclaimed. Those two were
always talking about this <em>toh</em> foolery. &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t
Aiel, Aviendha. And Mat Cauthon is a thorn in the foot to everybody
he meets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Elayne was nodding. &ldquo;I see. You are right,
Aviendha. But what must we <em>do</em>? You will have to help me,
near-sister. I don&rsquo;t intend to try to become Aiel, but I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I want you to be proud of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will <em>not</em> apologize!&rdquo; Nynaeve
snapped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have pride in knowing you,&rdquo; Aviendha said,
touching Elayne&rsquo;s cheek lightly. &ldquo;An apology is a beginning,
yet not enough to meet <em>toh</em>, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you listening to me?&rdquo; Nynaeve demanded. &ldquo;I said,
I will&mdash;not&mdash;apologize!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went right on talking. Only Birgitte looked at
her, and the woman wore a smile not far from outright laughter.
Nynaeve throttled her braid with both hands. She had known that
they should have sent Thom and Juilin.</p>
