<h4><em>The Bowl of the Winds</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">A</span>viendha
would have sat on the floor, but three other
women occupying the boat&rsquo;s small room left not quite enough
space, so she had to be content with folding her legs atop one of
the carved wooden benches built against the walls. That way, it was
not so much like sitting in a chair. At least the door was shut,
and there were no windows, only fanciful carved scrollwork piercing
the walls near the ceiling. She could not see the water outside,
but the piercings let in the smell of salt and the slap of waves
against the hull and the splash of the oars. Even the shrill hollow
cries of some sort of birds shouted of vast expanses of water. She
had seen men die for a pool they might have stepped across, but
this water was bitter beyond belief. Reading of it was not at all
the same as tasting it And the river had been at least half a mile
wide where they boarded this boat with its two oddly leering
oarsmen. Half a <em>mile</em> of water, and not a drop fit for
drinking. Who could imagine useless water?</p>

<p>The motion of the boat had changed, to a rocking back
and forth. Were they out of the river, yet? Into what was called &ldquo;the bay&rdquo;? That was wider still, far wider, so Elayne said.
Aviendha locked her hands on her knees and tried desperately to
think of anything else. If the others saw her fear, the shame would
follow her to the end of her days. The worst of it was, she had
suggested this, after hearing Elayne and Nynaeve talk of the Sea
Folk. How could she have known what it would be like?</p>

<p>The blue silk of her dress felt incredibly smooth,
and she latched on to that. She was barely used to skirts at all&mdash;she still yearned for the <em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em> the Wise
Ones had made her burn when she began training with them&mdash;and
here she wore a <em>silk</em> dress&mdash;of which she now owned
four!&mdash;and silk stockings instead of stout wool, and a silk
shift that made her aware of her skin in a way she never had been
before. She could not deny the beauty of the dress, no matter how
odd it was to find herself wearing such things, but silk was
precious, and rare. A woman might have a scarf of silk, to be worn
on feastdays and envied by others. Few women had two. It was
different among these wetlanders, though. Not everyone wore silk,
yet sometimes it seemed to her every second person did. Great bolts
and even bales of it came by ship from the lands beyond the
Three-fold Land. By ship. On the ocean. Water stretching to the
horizon, with many places where, if she understood correctly, you
could not see land at all. She came close to shivering at the
impossible thought.</p>

<p>None of the others looked as if they wished to talk.
Elayne absently twisted the Great Serpent ring on her right hand
and peered at something not to be seen inside the four walls. These
worries often overtook her. Two duties confronted her, and if one
lay nearer her heart, she had chosen the one she considered more
important, more honorable. It was her right and duty to become the
chief, the queen, of Andor, but she had chosen to continue hunting.
In a way, however important their search, that was like putting
something before clan or society, yet Aviendha felt pride.
Elayne&rsquo;s view of honor was as peculiar at times as the notion
of a woman being a chief, or her becoming chief just because her
mother had been, but she followed it admirably. Birgitte, in the
wide red trousers and short yellow coat Aviendha envied, sat toying
with her waist-long braid, lost in thought as well. Or maybe
sharing part of Elayne&rsquo;s worries. She was Elayne&rsquo;s first
Warder, which upset the Aes Sedai back in the Tarasin Palace no
end, though it did not seem to bother their Warders. Wetlander
customs were so curious they hardly bore thinking about.</p>

<p>If Elayne and Birgitte seemed to deflect any thought
of talk, Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara, directly opposite Aviendha by the
door, rebuffed it firmly. Nynaeve; not Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara.
Wetlanders liked to be called by only half their names, and
Aviendha was trying to remember, however much it felt like using a
honey-name. Rand al&rsquo;Thor was the only lover she had ever had,
and she did not think even of him so intimately, but she had to
learn their ways if she was to wed one of them.</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s deep brown eyes stared through her.
Her knuckles were white on a thick braid as dark as Birgitte&rsquo;s
was golden, and her face had gone beyond pale to a faint green.
From time to time she emitted a tiny muted groan. She did not
usually sweat; she and Elayne had taught Aviendha the trick.
Nynaeve was a puzzle. Brave to the point of madness sometimes, she
moaned over her supposed cowardice, and here she displayed her
shame for all to see without a care. How could the <em>motion</em>
disturb her so, when all that water did not?</p>

<p>Water again. Aviendha shut her eyes to avoid seeing
Nynaeve&rsquo;s face, but that only made the sounds of the birds and
the lapping water fill her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been thinking,&rdquo; Elayne said suddenly, then
paused. &ldquo;Are you all right, Aviendha? You&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Aviendha&rsquo;s
cheeks reddened, but at least Elayne did not say aloud that she had
jumped like a rabbit at the sound of her voice. Elayne seemed to
realize how close she had come to revealing Aviendha&rsquo;s
dishonor; color flushed her own cheeks as she continued. &ldquo;I was
thinking about Nicola, and Areina. About what Egwene told us last
night. You don&rsquo;t suppose they can cause <em>her</em> any
trouble, do you? What is she to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rid herself of them,&rdquo; Aviendha said, drawing a thumb
across her neck. The relief of speaking, of hearing voices, was so
great that she almost gasped. Elayne appeared shocked. She was
remarkably softhearted at times.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might be for the best,&rdquo; Birgitte said. She had
revealed no more name than that. Aviendha thought her a woman with
secrets. &ldquo;Areina could have made something of herself with time, but&mdash;Don&rsquo;t look at me that way, Elayne, and stop going all
prim and indignant in your head.&rdquo; Birgitte often slipped back and
forth between the Warder who obeyed and the older first-sister who
instructed whether or not you wished to learn. Right then, waving
an admonishing finger, she was the first-sister. &ldquo;You two
wouldn&rsquo;t have been warned to stay away if it was a difficulty
the Amyrlin could solve by having them set to work with the
laundresses or the like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne gave a sharp sniff in the face of what she
could not deny, and adjusted her green silk skirts where they were
drawn up in front to expose layers of blue and white petticoats.
She was wearing the local fashion, complete with creamy lace at her
wrists and around her neck, a gift from Tylin Quintara, as was the
close-fitting necklace of woven gold. Aviendha did not approve. The
upper half of the dress, the bodice, fitted as snugly as that
necklace, and a missing narrow oval of cloth revealed the inner
slopes of her breasts. Walking about where all could see was not
the same as the sweat tents; people in the streets of the city were
not <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>. Her own dress had a high neck that
brushed her chin with lace and no parts of it missing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beside,&rdquo; Birgitte went on, &ldquo;I would think <em>Marigan</em> would worry you more. She frightens me spitless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That name got through to Nynaeve, as well it might.
Her groaning ceased, and she sat up straight. &ldquo;If she comes after
us, we will just settle for her again. We&rsquo;ll&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;we&rsquo;ll&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Drawing breath, she stared at them pointedly, as if they
were arguing with her. What she said, in a faint voice, was &ldquo;Do you
think she will?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fretting will do no good,&rdquo; Elayne told her, much
more calmly than Aviendha could have managed if she thought one of
the Shadowsouled had marked her out. &ldquo;We will just have to do as
Egwene said and be careful.&rdquo; Nynaeve muttered something inaudible,
which was probably just as well.</p>

<p>Silence descended again, Elayne settling to a browner
study than before, Birgitte propping her chin on one hand as she
frowned at nothing. Nynaeve kept right on grumbling under her
breath, but she had both hands pressed to her middle now, and from
time to time she paused to swallow. The splashing of water seemed
louder than ever, and the cries of the birds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been thinking too, near-sister.&rdquo; She and
Elayne had not reached the point of adopting each other as
first-sisters yet, but she was sure they would, now. Already they
brushed each other&rsquo;s hair, and every night in the dark shared
another secret never told to anyone else. This Min woman, though&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;That was for later, when they were alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About what?&rdquo; Elayne asked absently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our search. We prepare for success, but we are as
far away as when we began. Does it make sense not to use every
weapon at hand? Mat Cauthon is <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, yet we work
to avoid him. Why not take him with us? With him, we might find the
bowl at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat?&rdquo; Nynaeve exclaimed incredulously. &ldquo;As well
stuff your shift full of nettles! I would not endure the man if he
had the bowl in his coat pocket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, <em>do</em> be quiet, Nynaeve,&rdquo; Elayne murmured,
without any heat. She shook her head wonderingly, taking no notice
of the other&rsquo;s sudden glower. &ldquo;Prickly&rdquo; only began to describe
Nynaeve, but they were all used to her ways. &ldquo;<em>Why</em>
didn&rsquo;t I think of that? It is so <em>obvious</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Birgitte murmured dryly, &ldquo;you had Mat the
scoundrel set so hard in your mind, you couldn&rsquo;t see he had
any use.&rdquo; Elayne gave her a cool stare, chin raised, then abruptly
grimaced, and nodded reluctantly. She did not accept criticism
easily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Nynaeve said in a voice that somehow managed to
be sharp and weak at the same time. The sickly cast of her face had
deepened, but it no longer seemed caused by the boat&rsquo;s
heaving. &ldquo;You cannot possibly mean it! Elayne, you know what a
torment he can be, how stubborn he is. He&rsquo;ll insist on
bringing those soldiers of his like a feastday parade. Try finding
anything in the Rahad with soldiers at your shoulder. Just try!
Inside two steps, he&rsquo;ll try to take charge, flaunting that
<em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> at us. He&rsquo;s a thousand times worse
than Vandene or Adeleas, or even Merilille. The way he behaves, you
would think we&rsquo;d walk into a bear&rsquo;s den just to see the
bear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Birgitte made a noise in her throat that might have
been amusement, and received a darted glare. She returned such a
look of bland innocence that Nynaeve began to sound as if she were
choking.</p>

<p>Elayne was more soothing; she probably would try to
make peace in a water-feud. &ldquo;He is <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, Nynaeve.
He alters the Pattern, alters chance, just being there. I&rsquo;m
ready to admit we need luck, and a <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> is more
than luck. Besides, we can snare two birds at once. We should not
have been letting him run loose all this time, no matter how busy
we were. That&rsquo;s done no one any good, him least of all. He
needs to be made fit for decent company. We will put him on a short
rein from the start.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve smoothed her skirts with considerable vigor.
She claimed to have no more interest in dresses than Aviendha&mdash;in what they looked like, anyway; she was always muttering
about good plain wool being fine enough for anybody&mdash;yet her
own blue dress was slashed with yellow on the skirts and sleeves,
and she herself had chosen its design. Every stitch she owned was
silk or embroidered or both, all cut with what Aviendha had learned
to recognize as fine care.</p>

<p>For once Nynaeve appeared to understand she would not
get her way. Sometimes she threw amazing tantrums until she did,
not that she would admit that was what they were. The glower faded
to a grumpy sulk. &ldquo;Who will ask him? Whoever does, he will make her
beg. You know he will. I&rsquo;d sooner marry him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne hesitated, then said firmly, &ldquo;Birgitte will.
And she won&rsquo;t beg; she will tell him. Most men will do as you
say if you use a firm, confident voice.&rdquo; Nynaeve looked doubtful,
and Birgitte jerked erect on her bench, startled for the first time
Aviendha had ever seen. With anyone else, Aviendha might have said
she looked a little afraid, too. Birgitte would have done very well
as <em>Far Dareis Mai</em>, for a wetlander. She had remarkable
skill with a bow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are the clear choice, Birgitte,&rdquo; Elayne went on
quickly. &ldquo;Nynaeve and I are Aes Sedai, and Aviendha might as well
be. We cannot <em>possibly</em> do it. Not and maintain proper
dignity. Not with him. You <em>know</em> what he is like.&rdquo; What had
happened to all that talk of a firm, confident voice? Not that
Aviendha had ever noticed that working for anyone except Sorilea.
It surely had not so far on Mat Cauthon that she had seen. &ldquo;Birgitte, he <em>can&rsquo;t</em> have recognized you. If he had,
he would have said something by now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whatever that meant, Birgitte leaned back against the
wall and laced her fingers over her stomach. &ldquo;I should have known
you&rsquo;d get back at me ever since I said it was a good thing
your bottom wasn&rsquo;t any&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped, and a faint
satisfied smile appeared on her lips. Nothing changed in
Elayne&rsquo;s expression, but plainly Birgitte thought she had
gained a measure of revenge. It must have been something felt
through the Warder bond. How Elayne&rsquo;s bottom entered into
anything, though, Aviendha could not puzzle out. Wetlanders were so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>odd</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;at times. Birgitte continued, still
wearing that smile. &ldquo;What I don&rsquo;t understand is why he starts
chafing as soon as he sees you two. It can&rsquo;t be that you
snagged him off here. Egwene was as deep in that as you, but I saw
him treat her with more respect than most of the sisters do.
Besides, the times I&rsquo;ve glimpsed him coming out of The
Wandering Woman, he looked to be enjoying himself.&rdquo; Her smile
became a grin that made Elayne sniff disapprovingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is one thing we need to change. A decent woman
cannot be in the room with him. Oh, do wipe that smirk off your
face, Birgitte. I vow, you are as bad as he, sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man was born just to be a trial,&rdquo; Nynaeve
muttered sourly.</p>

<p>Suddenly Aviendha was forcibly reminded that she was
on a boat as everything lurched, swaying and swinging around to a
halt. Rising and straightening dresses, they gathered the light
cloaks they had brought. She did not don hers; the sunlight here was
not so bright that she needed the hood to keep it from her eyes.
Birgitte only draped hers over one shoulder and pushed open the
door, following up the three steps after Nynaeve had rushed past
her with a hand clapped over her mouth.</p>

<p>Elayne paused to tie her cloak ribbons and arrange
the hood around her face, red-gold curls peeking out all around. &ldquo;You did not say much, near-sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said what I had to say. The decision was
yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The key thought was yours, though. Sometimes I think
the rest of us are turning into half-wits. Well.&rdquo; Half turning to
the steps, not quite looking at her, Elayne paused. &ldquo;Distances
bother me, sometimes, over water. I think I will look only at the
ship, myself. Nothing else.&rdquo; Aviendha nodded&mdash;her near-sister
had a fine delicacy&mdash;and they went up.</p>

<p>On the deck, Nynaeve was just shaking off
Birgitte&rsquo;s offer of help and pushing herself up from the
railing. The two oarsmen looked on in amusement as she wiped her
mouth with the back of her hand. Shiftless fellows with a brass
hoop in each ear, they must have had frequent use for the curved
daggers shoved behind their sashes. Most of their attention went to
working their pairs of long sweeps, though, walking back and forth
on the deck to hold the heaving boat in place near a ship that
almost took Aviendha&rsquo;s breath with its size, looming above
their suddenly very tiny vessel, its three great masts reaching
taller than most trees she had seen even here in the wetlands. They
had chosen it because it was the largest of the hundreds of Sea
Folk ships anchored in the bay. On a ship that big, surely it must
be possible to forget all the surrounding water. Except&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elayne had not really acknowledged her shame, and if
she had, a near-sister could know your deepest humiliation without
it mattering, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Amys said she had too much pride. She made
herself turn and look away from the boat.</p>

<p>She had never seen so much water in her life, not if
every drop seen before had been gathered in one place, all of it
rolling gray-green and here and there frothing white. Her eyes
darted, trying to avoid taking it in. Even the sky seemed larger
here, immense, with a liquid gold sun crawling up from the east. A
gusting wind blew, somewhat cooler than on the land and never
failing entirely. Clouds of birds flurried in the air, gray and
white and sometimes splotched with black, giving those shrill
cries. One, all black except for its head, skimmed along the
surface with its long lower beak slicing through the water, and a
slanted line of ungainly brown birds&mdash;pelicans, Elayne had
named them&mdash;suddenly folded their wings one by one and
plummeted with great splashes, bobbing back to the top, where they
floated, tilting up beaks of incredible size. There were ships
everywhere, many almost as large as the one behind her, not all
belonging to the Atha&rsquo;an Miere, and smaller vessels with one
or two masts moving under triangular sails. Smaller ships still,
mastless like the boat she was on, with a high sharp peak at the
front and a low flat house at the back, spidered across the water
on oars, one pair or two, or sometimes three. One long, narrow boat
that must have had twenty to a side looked like a hundred-legs
skittering along. And there was land. Maybe seven or eight miles
distant, sunlight gleamed off the white-plastered buildings of the
city. Seven or eight miles of water.</p>

<p>Swallowing, she turned back more swiftly than she had
turned away. She thought her cheeks must be greener than
Nynaeve&rsquo;s had been. Elayne was watching her, trying to keep a
smooth face, but wetlanders showed their emotions so plainly her
concern was visible. &ldquo;I am a fool, Elayne.&rdquo; Even with her, using no
more of her name made Aviendha feel uneasy; when they were
first-sisters, when they were sister-wives, it would be easier. &ldquo;A
wise woman listens to wise advice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are braver than I will ever be,&rdquo; Elayne replied,
quite seriously. She was another who kept denying that she had any
courage. Maybe that was also a wetlander custom? No, Aviendha had
heard wetlanders speak of thier own bravery; these Ebou Dari, for
one, seemed unable to utter three words without boasting. Elayne
drew a deep breath, steeling herself. &ldquo;Tonight we will talk about
Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha nodded, but she did not see how that
followed from talk of courage. How could sister-wives manage a
husband if they did not talk of him in detail? That was what the
older women told her, anyway, and the Wise Ones. They were not
always so forthcoming, of course. When she complained to Amys and
Bair that she must be ill because she felt as though Rand
al&rsquo;Thor was carrying some part of her around with him, they
had fallen down laughing. <em>You will learn</em>, they cackled at
her, and <em>You would have learned sooner had you grown up in
skirts</em>. As if she had ever wanted any life but that of a
Maiden, running with her spear-sisters. Maybe Elayne felt something
of the same emptiness. Speaking of him did seem to make the
hollowness grow even while filling it.</p>

<p>For some time she had been aware of voices rising,
and now she heard the words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;you earringed buffoon!&rdquo; Nynaeve was shaking
her fist at a very dark man peering down at her from over the tall
side of the ship. He looked calm, but then, he could not see the
glow of <em>saidar</em> surrounding her. &ldquo;We are not after the gift
of passage, so it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you refuse it to Aes
Sedai! You let down a ladder this instant!&rdquo; The men at the oars
were missing their grins. Apparently they had failed to see the
serpent rings back at the stone landing, and they did not look
pleased to learn they had Aes Sedai aboard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear,&rdquo; Elayne sighed. &ldquo;I must retrieve this,
Aviendha, or we&rsquo;ve wasted the morning just so she could lose
her breakfast porridge.&rdquo; Gliding across the <em>deck</em>&mdash;Aviendha was proud of knowing the proper names for things on boats&mdash;Elayne addressed the man up on the ship. &ldquo;I am Elayne
Trakand, Daughter-Heir of Andor and Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah. My
companion is quite truthful. We do not seek the gift of passage.
But we must speak with your Windfinder on a matter of urgency. Tell
her we know of the Weaving of Winds. Tell her we know of
Windfinders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man above frowned down at her, then abruptly
vanished without a word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The woman will probably think you mean to blab her
secrets,&rdquo; Nynaeve muttered, jerking her cloak into place. She tied
the ribbons fiercely. &ldquo;You know how afraid they are that Aes Sedai
will haul them all off to the Tower, if it&rsquo;s known most can
channel. Only a ninny thinks she can threaten people, Elayne, and
still get anywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha burst out laughing. By the startled look
Nynaeve gave her, she did not see the joke she had made on herself.
Elayne&rsquo;s lips quivered, though, however she tried to hold
them. You could never be sure about wetlander humor; they found
strange things funny and missed the best.</p>

<p>Whether or not the Windfinder felt threatened, by the
time Elayne had paid the boatmen and cautioned them to wait for
their return&mdash;with Nynaeve grumbling over the amount and
telling them she would box their ears if they left, and how she was
to manage that nearly set Aviendha laughing again&mdash;by the
time all that was done, it seemed a decision had been reached to
allow them on. No ladder was lowered, but instead a flat piece of
wood, the two ropes it hung from becoming one and running up to a
thick pole swung out over the side from one of the masts. Nynaeve
took her place sitting on the board with dire warnings for the
boatmen if they even thought of trying to look up her skirts, and
Elayne blushed and held hers tightly around her legs, hunched over
so she appeared ready to fall off headfirst as she wobbled into the
air and disappeared from sight onto the ship. One of the fellows
looked upward anyway, until Birgitte struck him on the nose with
her fist. They certainly did not watch <em>her</em> ascent.</p>

<p>Aviendha&rsquo;s belt knife was small, with a blade
not half a foot long, but the oarsmen frowned worriedly when she
drew it. Her arm went back, and they fell sprawling to the deck as
the knife whirled over their heads to sink with a solid <em>thunk</em> into the thick wooden post at the front of the boat.
Looping the cloak over her arms like a shawl, she hoisted her
skirts well above her knees so she could climb over the oars and
retrieve her blade, then took her place on the dangling board. She
did not replace the knife in its sheath. For some reason the two
men exchanged confused looks, but they kept their eyes down as she
was lifted up. Perhaps she was beginning to get a feel for
wetlander customs.</p>

<p>Settling onto the great ship&rsquo;s deck, she gaped,
almost forgetting to climb off the narrow seat. She had read of the
Atha&rsquo;an Miere, but reading and seeing was as different as
reading of saltwater and tasting it. They were all dark, for one
thing, much darker than the Ebou Dari, even darker than most
Tairens, with straight black hair and black eyes and tattooed
hands. Bare-chested, barefoot men with bright narrow sashes holding
up baggy breeches of some dark cloth that had an oily look to it,
and women in blouses as brilliantly colored as their sashes, all
with a sway to their movements, gliding gracefully with the rocking
of the ship. Sea Folk women had very strange customs when it came
to men, according to what she had read, dancing with no more than a
single scarf for covering and worse, but it was the earrings that
made her stare. Most had three or four, often with polished stones,
and several actually had a small ring in one side of their noses!
The men did, too, the earrings at least, and just as many heavy
gold and silver chains around their necks. Men! Some wetlander men
wore rings in their ears, true&mdash;most Ebou Dari men seemed to&mdash;but so many! And necklaces! Wetlanders did have strange
ways. The Sea Folk never left their ships&mdash;never&mdash;so
she had read, and supposedly they ate their dead. She had not been
quite able to credit that, but if the men wore necklaces, who could
say what else they did?</p>

<p>The woman who came to meet them wore breeches and
blouse and sash like the others, but hers were of brocaded yellow
silk, the sash knotted intricately with ends trailing to her knee,
and one of her necklaces bore a small golden box of intricate
piercework. A sweetly musky scent surrounded her. Gray streaked her
hair heavily, and she had a grave face. Five small fat golden rings
decorated each of her ears, and a fine chain connected one to a
similar ring in her nose. Tiny medallions of polished gold dangling
from the chain flashed in the sunlight as she studied them.</p>

<p>Aviendha pulled her hand down from her own nose&mdash;to wear that chain, always tugging!&mdash;and barely
managed to suppress a laugh. Wetlander customs were odd beyond
belief, and surely no one deserved the name better than the Sea
Folk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Malin din Toral Breaking Wave,&rdquo; the woman said, &ldquo;Wavemistress of Clan Somarin and Sailmistress of <em>Windrunner</em>.&rdquo; A Wavemistress was important, like a clan chief,
yet she seemed at a loss, looking from one face to the next, until
her eye fell on the Great Serpent rings Elayne and Nynaeve wore,
and then she exhaled in resignation. &ldquo;If it pleases you to come
with me, Aes Sedai?&rdquo; she said to Nynaeve.</p>

<p>The back of the ship was raised, and she led the way
inside that by a door, then down a hallway to a large room&mdash;a
<em>cabin</em>&mdash;with a low ceiling. Aviendha doubted Rand
al&rsquo;Thor would have been able to stand upright beneath one of
the thick beams. Except for a few lacquered chests, everything
seemed to have been built in place, cabinets along the walls, even
the long table that ran half the length of the room and the
armchairs that surrounded it. It was difficult to think of
something the size of this ship being made of wood, and even after
all her time in the wetlands, the sight of all that polished wood
nearly made her gasp. It glowed almost as much as the gilded lamps,
hanging unlit in some sort of cage so they remained upright as the
ship moved with the waves. In truth, the ship hardly seemed to move
at all, at least in comparison with the boat they had been on, but
unfortunately the back of the cabin, of the ship, was a line of
windows with the painted and gilded shutters standing open, giving
a splendid view of the bay. Worse, there was no land in sight out
those windows. No land at all! Her throat seized. She could not
have spoken. She could not have screamed, although that was what
she wanted to do.</p>

<p>Those windows and what they showed&mdash;what they
did not show&mdash;had caught her eyes so quickly that it took her
a moment to realize people were there already. A fine thing! Had
they wished, they could have killed her before she knew. Not that
they showed any sign of hostility, but you could never be too
careful with wetlanders.</p>

<p>A spindly old man with deep-set eyes was sitting at
his ease atop one of the chests; what little hair remained to him
was white, and his dark face had a kindly look, though a full dozen
earrings altogether and a number of thick gold chains around his
neck gave his expression a strange twist in her eyes. Like the men
above, he was barefoot and bare-chested, but his breeches were a
dark blue silk, and his long sash a bright red. An ivory-hilted
sword was thrust through that sash, she noted with disdain, as well
as two curved daggers to match.</p>

<p>The slender, handsome woman with her arms folded and
a grimly foreboding frown was more worthy of notice. She wore only
four earrings in each ear, and fewer medallions on her chain than
Malin din Toral, and her clothing was all in reddish-yellow silk.
She could channel; Aviendha knew that, this close. She must be the
woman they had come for, the Windfinder. And yet it was another who
held Aviendha&rsquo;s eye. And for that matter, Elayne&rsquo;s and
Nynaeve&rsquo;s and Birgitte&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The woman who had looked up from an unrolled map on
the table might have been as old as the man by her white hair.
Short, no taller than Nynaeve, she looked like someone who had once
been stocky and was beginning to go stout, but her jaw thrust
forward like a hammer, and her black eyes spoke of intelligence.
And power. Not the One Power, just that of someone who said &ldquo;go&rdquo;
and knew that people would go, yet she had it strongly. Her
breeches were brocaded green silk, her blouse blue, and her sash
red like the man&rsquo;s. The stout-bladed knife in a gilded sheath
tucked behind that sash had a round pommel covered with red and
green stones; firedrops and emeralds, Aviendha thought. Twice as
many medallions hung from her nose chain as from Malin din
Toral&rsquo;s, and another, thinner gold chain connected the six
rings in each of her ears. Aviendha barely kept her hand from going
to her own nose again.</p>

<p>Without a word the white-haired woman came to stand
in front of Nynaeve, rudely examining her from head to toe,
frowning in particular at Nynaeve&rsquo;s face and the Great Serpent
ring on her right hand. She took no time about it, and with a grunt
moved on from her ruffled object of study to give Elayne the same
quick, intense scrutiny, and then Birgitte. At last she spoke. &ldquo;You
are not an Aes Sedai.&rdquo; Her voice sounded like rocks tumbling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the nine winds and Stormbringer&rsquo;s beard, I
am not,&rdquo; Birgitte replied. Sometimes she said things even Elayne
and Nynaeve seemed not to understand, but the white-haired woman
jumped as if she had been goosed, and stared a long moment before
turning to frown up at Aviendha.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not Aes Sedai, either,&rdquo; she grated after the
same examination.</p>

<p>Aviendha drew herself to her full height, feeling as
though the woman had rummaged through her garments and twirled her
about to look at her better. &ldquo;I am Aviendha, of the Nine Valleys
sept of the Taardad Aiel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman gave twice the start she had for Birgitte,
black eyes going wide. &ldquo;You are not garbed as I expected, girl&rdquo; was
all she said, though, and strode back to the far end of the table,
where she planted her fists on her hips and studied them all again,
much as she might have some strange animal she had never seen
before. &ldquo;I am Nesta din Reas Two Moons,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;Mistress of the Ships to the Atha&rsquo;an Miere. How do you know
what you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve had been working on a scowl since the woman
first looked at her, and now she snapped, &ldquo;Aes Sedai know what they
know. And we expect more in the way of manners than I&rsquo;ve seen
so far! I certainly saw more the last time I was on a Sea Folk
ship. Maybe we should find another, where the people don&rsquo;t all
have sore teeth.&rdquo; Nesta din Reas&rsquo; face grew darker, but Elayne
of course stepped into the breech, removing her cloak and laying it
over the edge of the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light illumine you and your vessels,
Shipmistress, and send the winds to speed you all.&rdquo; Her curtsy was
moderately deep; Aviendha had become a judge of these things, for
all she thought it looked the most awkward thing any woman could
ever do. &ldquo;Forgive us if there have been words in haste. We mean no
disrespect to one who is as a queen to the Atha&rsquo;an Miere.&rdquo;
That with a speaking look for Nynaeve. Nynaeve only shrugged,
though.</p>

<p>Elayne introduced herself again, and the rest of
them, to strange reactions. That Elayne was Daughter-Heir produced
none, though that was a high position among the wetlanders, and
that she was Green Ajah and Nynaeve Yellow received sniffs from
Nesta din Reas and sharp looks from the spindly old man. Elayne
blinked, taken aback, but she went on smoothly. &ldquo;We have come for
two reasons. The lesser is to ask how you mean to aid the Dragon
Reborn, who according to the Jendai Prophecy you call the Coramoor.
The greater is to request the help of this vessel&rsquo;s
Windfinder. Whose name,&rdquo; she added gently, &ldquo;I regret I do not yet
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The slender woman who could channel reddened. &ldquo;I am
Dorile din Eiran Long Feather, Aes Sedai. I may help, if it pleases
the Light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Malin din Toral looked abashed, too. &ldquo;The welcome of
my ship to you,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;and the grace of the Light be upon
you until you leave his decks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not so Nesta din Reas. &ldquo;The Bargain is with the
Coramoor,&rdquo; she said in a hard voice, and made a sharp cutting
gesture. &ldquo;The shorebound have no part of it, except where they tell
of his coming. You, girl, Nynaeve. What ship gave you the gift of
passage? Who was his Windfinder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t recall.&rdquo; Nynaeve&rsquo;s airy tone was
at odds with the stony smile she wore. She had a deathgrip on her
braid, too, but at least she had not embraced <em>saidar</em>
again. &ldquo;And I am Nynaeve Sedai, Nynaeve Aes Sedai, not girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Putting her hands flat on the table, Nesta din Reas
directed a stare at her that reminded Aviendha of Sorilea. &ldquo;Perhaps
you are, but I will know who revealed what should not have been
revealed. She has lessons of silence to learn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A split sail is split, Nesta,&rdquo; the old man said
suddenly, in a deep voice much stronger than his bony limbs
suggested. Aviendha had taken him for a guard, but his tone was
that of an equal. &ldquo;It might be well to ask what aid Aes Sedai would
have of us, in days when the Coramoor has come, and the seas rage
in endless storms, and the doom of the Prophecy sails the oceans.
If they are Aes Sedai?&rdquo; That with a raised eyebrow to the
Windfinder.</p>

<p>She answered quietly, in a respectful voice. &ldquo;Three
can channel, including her.&rdquo; She pointed at Aviendha. &ldquo;I have never
met anyone so strong as they. They must be. Who else would dare
wear the ring?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Waving her to silence, Nesta din Reas turned that
same iron gaze on the man. &ldquo;Aes Sedai never ask aid, Baroc,&rdquo; she
growled. &ldquo;Aes Sedai never <em>ask</em> anything.&rdquo; He met her gaze mildly,
but after a moment she sighed as though he had stared her down. The
eyes she aimed at Elayne were no whit softer, though. &ldquo;What would
you have of us&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She hesitated. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Daughter-Heir of
Andor?&rdquo; Even that sounded skeptical.</p>

<p>Nynaeve gathered herself, ready to launch into an
attack&mdash;Aviendha had had to listen to more than one tirade
sparked by the Aes Sedai back in the Tarasin Palace and their habit
of forgetting that she and Elayne were Aes Sedai too; someone not
even Aes Sedai denying it might bring the shedding of blood&mdash;Nynaeve gathered herself up and opened her mouth&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;And Elayne
silenced her with a touch on the arm and a whisper too low for
Aviendha to hear. Nynaeve&rsquo;s face was still crimson, and she
looked about to pull her braid out slowly by the roots, yet she
held her tongue. Maybe Elayne <em>could</em> make peace in a
water-feud.</p>

<p>Of course, Elayne could not be pleased, when not only
her right to be called Aes Sedai but her right to the title of
Daughter-Heir was doubted so openly. Most would have thought her
quite calm, but Aviendha knew the signs. The raised chin spoke of
anger; add eyes open as wide as they would go, and Elayne was a
torch to overwhelm Nynaeve&rsquo;s ember. Besides, Birgitte was on
her toes, face like stone and eyes like fire. She did not usually
mirror Elayne&rsquo;s emotions, except when they were very strong.
Wrapping her fingers around the hilt of her belt knife, Aviendha
readied herself to embrace <em>saidar</em>. She would kill the
Windfinder first; the woman was not weak in the Power, and she
would be dangerous. They could find others with so many ships
about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We seek a <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>.&rdquo; Except that
her tone was cool, anyone who did not know her would think Elayne
was absolutely serene. She faced Nesta din Reas, but she addressed
everyone, perhaps especially the Windfinder. &ldquo;With it, we believe
we can remedy the weather. It must trouble you as much as it does
the land. Baroc spoke of endless storms. You must be able to see
the Dark One&rsquo;s touch, the Father of Storms&rsquo; touch, on the
sea just as we do on the land. With this <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>,
we can change that, but we cannot do it alone. It will require many
women working together, perhaps a full circle of thirteen. We think
those women should include Windfinders. No one else knows so much
of weather, not any Aes Sedai living. That is the aid we ask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dead silence met her speech, until Dorile din Eiran
said carefully, &ldquo;This <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, Aes Sedai. What is
it called? How does it look?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has no name, that I know,&rdquo; Elayne told her. &ldquo;It
is a thick crystal bowl, shallow but something over two feet
across, and worked inside with clouds. When it is channeled into,
the clouds move&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Bowl of the Winds,&rdquo; the Windfinder broke in
excitedly, stepping toward Elayne as if she did not realize it. &ldquo;They have the Bowl of the Winds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You truly have it?&rdquo; The Wavemistress&rsquo;s eyes
were fixed on Elayne eagerly, and she also took an involuntary
step.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are <em>looking</em> for it,&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;But
we know it is in Ebou Dar. If it is the same&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be,&rdquo; Malin din Toral exclaimed. &ldquo;By your
description, it must!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Bowl of the Winds,&rdquo; Dorile din Eiran breathed. &ldquo;To think it would be found again after two thousand years here! It
must be the Coramoor. He must have&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nesta din Reas&rsquo; hands slapped together loudly. &ldquo;Do I see a Wavemistress and her Windfinder, or two deckgirls at
their first shipmeet?&rdquo; Malin din Toral&rsquo;s cheeks reddened with
a proud anger, and she bent her head stiffly, pride in that as
well. Twice as flushed, Dorile din Eiran bowed, touching fingertips
to forehead, lips and heart.</p>

<p>The Shipmistress frowned at them a moment, before
going on. &ldquo;Baroc, summon the other Wavemistresses who hold this
port, and the First Twelve as well. With their Windfinders. And let
them know you will hoist them by their toes in their own rigging if
they do not hurry.&rdquo; As he rose, she added, &ldquo;Oh. And have tea sent
down. Working out the terms of this bargain will be thirsty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man nodded; that he might dangle
Wavemistresses by their toes and that he must send tea were
accepted equally. Eyeing Aviendha and the others, he sauntered out
with that rolling walk. She changed her opinion when she saw his
eyes close up. It might have been a fatal mistake to kill the
Windfinder first.</p>

<p>Someone must have been awaiting orders of the sort,
because Baroc was only gone moments before a slim, pretty young man
with a single thin ring in each ear entered carrying a wooden tray
that bore a square blue-glazed teapot with a golden handle and
large blue cups of thick pottery. Nesta din Reas waved him out&mdash;&ldquo;He will spread enough tales as it is, without hearing what
he should not,&rdquo; she said when he was gone&mdash;and directed
Birgitte to pour. Which she did, to Aviendha&rsquo;s surprise, and
maybe her own.</p>

<p>The Shipmistress settled Elayne and Nynaeve in chairs
at one end of the table, apparently intent on beginning her
bargaining. Aviendha refused a chair&mdash;at the other end of the
table&mdash;but Birgitte took one, swinging the arm out, then
latching it back when she was seated. The Wavemistress and the
Windfinder were excluded from that discussion, too, if discussion
it could be called. The words were too low to hear, but Nesta din
Reas emphasized everything she said with a finger driven like a
spear, Elayne had her chin so high she seemed to be looking down
her nose, and if Nynaeve for once was managing to keep her face
calm, she seemed to be trying to climb her own braid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it pleases the Light, I will speak with both of
you,&rdquo; Malin din Toral said, looking from Aviendha to Birgitte, &ldquo;but
I think I must hear your story first.&rdquo; Birgitte began to look
alarmed as the woman sat down across from her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which means I can speak first with you, if it
pleases the Light,&rdquo; Dorile din Eiran told Aviendha. &ldquo;I have read of
the Aiel. If it pleases you, tell me, if an Aiel woman must kill a
man every day, how are there any men left among you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha did her best not to stare. How could the
woman believe such nonsense?</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you live among us?&rdquo; Malin din Toral said
over her teacup at the near end of the table. Birgitte was leaning
away from her as though she wanted to climb over the back of the
chair.</p>

<p>At the far end of the table, Nesta din Reas&rsquo;
voice rose for a moment. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;came to me, not I to you. <em>That</em> sets the basis for our bargain, even if you are Aes
Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slipping into the room, Baroc paused between Aviendha
and Birgitte. &ldquo;It seems your shoreboat departed as soon as you came
below, but have no worry; <em>Windrunner</em> has boats to put you
on the shore.&rdquo; Walking on down the cabin, he took a chair below
Elayne and Nynaeve and joined right in. When they looked at
whichever was speaking, the other could observe them unnoticed.
They had lost an advantage, one they needed. &ldquo;Of course the bargain
is on our terms,&rdquo; he said in tones of disbelief that it could be
otherwise, while the Shipmistress studied Elayne and Nynaeve as a
woman might two goats she meant to skin for a feast. Baroc&rsquo;s
smile was almost fatherly. &ldquo;Who asks must of course pay
highest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you must have lived among us to know those
ancient oaths,&rdquo; Malin din Toral insisted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you well, Aviendha?&rdquo; Dorile din Eiran asked. &ldquo;Even here, the motion of a ship sometimes affects shorefolk&mdash;No? And my questions do not offend? Then tell me. Do Aiel
women truly tie a man down before you&mdash;I mean, when you and
he&mdash;when you&mdash;&rdquo; Cheeks reddened, she broke off with a
weak smile. &ldquo;Are many Aiel women as strong in the One Power as
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not the Windfinder&rsquo;s foolish fumbling
about that had made the blood drain from Aviendha&rsquo;s face, or
that Birgitte appeared ready to run once she could manage to
unlatch the chair arm again, or even that Nynaeve and Elayne were
apparently discovering they were two bright-eyed girls at a fair,
in the hands of well-seasoned traders. They would all blame her,
and rightly. She was the one who had said if they could not take
the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> back to Egwene and the other Aes
Sedai once found, why not secure these Sea Folk women they spoke
of? Time could not be wasted, waiting for Egwene al&rsquo;Vere to
say they could return. They would blame her, and she would meet her
<em>toh</em>, but she was remembering the boats she had seen on the
deck, stacked upside down atop one another. Boats without any
shelter on board. They would blame her, but whatever debt she owed
she was going to repay a thousandfold in shame by the time she was
taken across seven or eight miles of water in an open boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you have a bucket?&rdquo; she asked the Windfinder
faintly.</p>
