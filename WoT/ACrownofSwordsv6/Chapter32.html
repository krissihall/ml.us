<h4><em>Sealed to the Flame</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">E</span><em>laida
 do Avriny a&rsquo;Roihan sat regally in the
Amyrlin Seat, the tall vine-carved chair painted now in only six
colors instead of seven, a six-striped stole on her shoulders, and
ran her gaze around the circular Hall of the Tower. The
Sitters&rsquo; painted chairs had been rearranged along the
stair-fronted dais that encircled the chamber beneath the great
dome, spaced out to account for only six Ajahs instead of seven
now, and eighteen Sitters stood obediently. Young al&rsquo;Thor
knelt quietly beside the Amyrlin Seat; he would not speak unless
given leave, which he would not receive today. Today, he was merely
another symbol of her power, and the twelve most favored Sitters
glowed with the link that she herself controlled to keep him
safe.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>The greater consensus is achieved, Mother,&rdquo;
Alviarin said meekly at her shoulder, bowing humbly against the
Flame-topped staff.</em></p>

<p><em>Down on the floor, below the dais, Sheriam
screamed wildly and had to be restrained by the Tower Guard at her
side. The Red sister shielding her sneered in contempt. Romanda and
Lelaine clung to a cold outward dignity, but most of the others
shielded and guarded on the floor wept quietly, perhaps in relief
that only four women had been given the ultimate penalty, perhaps
in fear of what else was to come. The most ashen faces belonged to
the three who had dared sit in a rebel Hall for the now-dissolved
Blue. Every rebel had been cast out from her Ajah until Elaida
granted permission to request reacceptance, but the onetime Blues
knew they confronted difficult years working their way into her
good graces, years before they would be allowed to enter any Ajah
at all. Until then, they lay in the palm of her hand.</em></p>

<p><em>She stood, and it seemed the One Power flowing
through her from the circle was a manifestation of her power. &ldquo;The
Hall concurs with the will of the Amyrlin Seat. Let Romanda be the
first to be birched.&rdquo; Romanda&rsquo;s head jerked; let her see how
much dignity she could retain until her stilling. Elaida gestured
curtly. &ldquo;Take the prisoners away, and bring in the first of the
poor deluded sisters who followed them. I will accept their
submission.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>There was a cry among the prisoners, and one tore
free from the guard gripping her arm. Egwene al&rsquo;Vere threw
herself onto the steps at Elaida&rsquo;s feet, hands outstretched,
tears streaming down her cheeks.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Forgive me, Mother!&rdquo; the girl wept. &ldquo;I repent! I
will submit; I do submit. Please, do not still me!&rdquo; Brokenly, she
sagged facedown, shoulders shaking with sobs. &ldquo;Please, Mother! I
repent! I do!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>The Amyrlin Seat can show mercy,&rdquo; Elaida said
exultantly. The White Tower had to lose Lelaine and Romanda and
Sheriam as examples, but she could keep this girl&rsquo;s strength.
She</em> was <em>the White Tower. &ldquo;Egwene al&rsquo;Vere, you have rebelled
against your Amyrlin, but I will show mercy. You will be dressed in
novice white again, until I myself judge you ready to be raised
further, but this very day you shall be the first to take a Fourth
Oath on the Oath Rod, of fealty and obedience to the Amyrlin
Seat.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>The prisoners began falling on their knees,
crying out to be allowed to take that oath, to prove their true
submission. Lelaine was one of the first, and neither Romanda nor
Sheriam the last. Egwene crawled up the steps to kiss the hem of
Elaida&rsquo;s dress.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I yield myself to your will, Mother,&rdquo; she
murmured through her tears. &ldquo;Thank you. Oh, thank you!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>Alviarin seized Elaida&rsquo;s shoulder, shook
her. &ldquo;Wake up, you fool woman!&rdquo; she growled.</em></p>

<p>Elaida&rsquo;s eyes popped open to the dim light of a
single lamp held by Alviarin, bending over her bed with a hand on
her shoulder. Still only half-awake, she mumbled, &ldquo;What did you
say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;Please wake up, Mother,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
Alviarin replied coolly. &ldquo;Covarla Baldene has returned from
Cairhien.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elaida shook her head, trying to clear away the tag
end of the dream. &ldquo;So soon? I did not expect them for another week
at least. Covarla, you say? Where is Galina?&rdquo; Foolish questions;
Alviarin would not know what she meant.</p>

<p>But in that cool crystalline tone, the woman said, &ldquo;She believes Galina dead or a prisoner. I fear the news is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;not good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What Alviarin should or should not know rushed out of
Elaida&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she demanded, throwing off the silk
sheet, but as she rose and belted a silk robe over her nightdress,
she heard only snatches. A battle. Hordes of Aiel women channeling.
Al&rsquo;Thor gone. Disaster. Distractedly, she noticed that
Alviarin was neatly garbed in a silver-embroidered white dress,
with the Keeper&rsquo;s stole around her neck. The woman had waited
till she clothed herself to bring her this!</p>

<p>The case clock in her study softly chimed Second Low
as she entered the sitting room. The small hours of the morning;
the worst time to receive dire news. Covarla rose hastily from one
of the red-cushioned armchairs, her implacable face sagging with
weariness and worry, and knelt to kiss Elaida&rsquo;s ring. Her dark
riding dress still bore the dust of travel, and her pale hair
needed a brush, but she had donned the shawl she had worn as long
as Elaida had been alive.</p>

<p>Elaida barely waited for the woman&rsquo;s lips to
touch the Great Serpent before pulling her hand away. &ldquo;Why were you
sent?&rdquo; she said curtly. Snatching up her knitting from where she
had left it in a chair, she sat and began to work the long ivory
needles. Knitting served many of the same purposes as fondling her
carved ivory miniatures, and she surely needed soothing now.
Knitting helped her think, too. She had to think. &ldquo;Where is
Katerine?&rdquo; If Galina was dead, Katerine should have taken charge
ahead of Coiren; Elaida had made it clear that once al&rsquo;Thor
was taken, the Red Ajah was in charge.</p>

<p>Covarla stood slowly, as if uncertain she should. Her
hands tightened on the red-fringed shawl looped over her arms. &ldquo;Katerine is among the missing, Mother. I stand highest among those
who&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Her words trailed off as Elaida stared at her, fingers
frozen in the act of passing wool over one of the needles. Covarla
swallowed and shifted her feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many, daughter?&rdquo; Elaida asked finally. She could
not believe her voice was so calm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot say how many escaped, Mother,&rdquo; Covarla said
hesitantly. &ldquo;We dared not wait to make a thorough search, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many?&rdquo; Elaida shouted. With a shudder, she made
herself concentrate on her knitting; giving way to anger was
weakness. Loop the yarn, pull through and push down. Soothing
motions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I brought eleven other sisters with me,
Mother.&rdquo; The woman paused, breathing hard, and then, when Elaida
said nothing, rushed on. &ldquo;Others may be making their way back,
Mother. Gawyn refused to wait longer, and we dared not remain
without him and his Younglings, not with so many Aiel about, and
the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elaida did not hear. Twelve returned. Had any more
escaped, they would have sped back to Tar Valon, would have been
here as soon as Covarla, surely. Even if one or two were injured,
traveling slowly&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Twelve out of thirty-nine. The Tower had not
suffered a disaster of this magnitude even during the Trolloc
Wars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These Aiel wilders must be taught a lesson,&rdquo; she
said, trampling over whatever Covarla was babbling. Galina had
thought she could use Aiel to divert Aiel; what a fool the woman
had been! &ldquo;We will rescue the sisters they hold prisoner, and teach
them what it means to defy Aes Sedai! And we will take al&rsquo;Thor
again.&rdquo; She would not let him get away, not if she had to
personally lead the entire White Tower to take him! The Foretelling
had been certain. She <em>would</em> triumph!</p>

<p>Casting an uneasy glance at Alviarin, Covarla shifted
her feet again. &ldquo;Mother, those men&mdash;I think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not think!&rdquo; Elaida snapped. Her hands clasped the
knitting needles convulsively, and she leaned forward so fiercely
that Covarla actually raised a hand as though to fend off an
attack. Alviarin&rsquo;s presence had slipped from Elaida&rsquo;s
mind. Well, the woman knew what she knew, now; that could be dealt
with later. &ldquo;You have maintained secrecy, Covarla? Aside from
informing the Keeper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Mother,&rdquo; Covarla said hastily. Her head
bobbed with eagerness, glad that she had done something right. &ldquo;I
entered the city alone, and hid my face until I reached Alviarin.
Gawyn meant to accompany me, but the bridge guards refused to let
any member of the Younglings pass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forget Gawyn Trakand,&rdquo; Elaida ordered sourly. That
young man remained alive to trouble her plans, it seemed. If Galina
did turn out to be alive still, she would pay for failing in that,
on top of letting al&rsquo;Thor escape. &ldquo;You will leave the city as
circumspectly as you entered, daughter, and keep yourself and the
others well hidden in one of the villages beyond the bridge towns
until I send for you. Dorian will do nicely.&rdquo; They would have to
sleep in barns in that tiny hamlet, which had no inn; the least
their bungling deserved. &ldquo;Go, now. And pray that someone above you
does arrive soon. The Hall will demand amends for this unparalleled
catastrophe, and at the moment, it seems you stand highest among
those at fault. Go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Covarla&rsquo;s face went white. She tottered so
making her curtsy to leave, Elaida thought she might fall.
Bunglers! She was surrounded by fools, traitors and bunglers!</p>

<p>As soon as Elaida heard the outer door close, she
hurled down her knitting and sprang to her feet, rounding on
Alviarin. &ldquo;Why have I not heard of this before? If al&rsquo;Thor
escaped&mdash;what was it you said? seven days ago?&mdash;if he
escaped seven days ago, someone&rsquo;s eyes-and-ears must have seen
him. Why was I not informed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can only pass on to you what the Ajahs pass to me,
Mother.&rdquo; Alviarin adjusted her stole calmly, not a whit ruffled. &ldquo;Do you really mean to court a third debacle by attempting to
rescue the captives?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elaida sniffed dismissively. &ldquo;Do you really believe
wilders can stand before Aes Sedai? Galina let herself be
surprised; she must have.&rdquo; She frowned. &ldquo;What do you mean, a <em>third</em> debacle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t listen, Mother.&rdquo; Shockingly,
Alviarin sat without being given permission, crossing her knees and
serenely arranging her skirts. &ldquo;Covarla thought they might have
held out against the wilders&mdash;though I believe she is nowhere
near as certain as she tried to pretend&mdash;but the men were
another matter. Several hundred of them in black coats, all
channeling. She was very certain of that, and so are the others,
apparently. Living weapons, she called them. I think she nearly
soiled herself just remembering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elaida stood as if poleaxed. Several hundred? &ldquo;Impossible. There can&rsquo;t be more than&mdash;&rdquo; She walked to a
table that seemed all ivory and gilt, and poured herself a goblet
of wine punch. The lip of the crystal pitcher rattled against the
crystal goblet, and almost as much punch went onto the golden
tray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since al&rsquo;Thor can Travel,&rdquo; Alviarin said
suddenly, &ldquo;it seems logical at least that some of these men can,
too. Covarla is quite sure that was how they arrived. I suppose he
is rather upset at his treatment. Covarla seemed somewhat uneasy
about it; she implied that a number of the sisters were. He might
feel he owes you something. It would not be pleasant to have those
men suddenly stepping out of thin air right here in the Tower,
would it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elaida practically tossed the punch down her throat.
Galina had been instructed to begin making al&rsquo;Thor supple. If
he came for revenge&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;If there really were hundreds of men who
could channel, or even one hundred&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She had to think!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, if they were coming, I believe they would
have by now. They would not have wasted surprise. Perhaps even
al&rsquo;Thor doesn&rsquo;t wish to confront the full Tower. I
suppose they have all returned to Caemlyn, to their Black Tower.
Which means, I fear, that Toveine has a most unpleasant shock
awaiting her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pen an order for her to return immediately,&rdquo; Elaida
said hoarsely. The punch did not seem to help. She turned, and gave
a start to find Alviarin right in front of her. Maybe there were
not even one hundred&mdash;not even one hundred?&mdash;at sunset,
<em>ten</em> would have seemed madness&mdash;but she could not
take the chance. &ldquo;Write it out yourself, Alviarin. Now; right
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how is it to be gotten to her?&rdquo; Alviarin tilted
her head, icily curious. For some reason, she wore a faint smile. &ldquo;None of <em>us</em> can Travel. The ships will put Toveine and her
party ashore in Andor any day now, if they have not already. You
told her to divide into small groups and avoid villages, so as to
give no warning. No, Elaida, I am afraid Toveine will regather her
forces near Caemlyn and attack the Black Tower without any word
from us reaching her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elaida gasped. The woman had just called her by name!
And before she could begin to splutter with outrage, worse
came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you are in great trouble, Elaida.&rdquo; Cold eyes
stared into Elaida&rsquo;s and cold words slid smoothly from
Alviarin&rsquo;s smiling lips. &ldquo;Sooner or later, the Hall will learn
of the disaster with al&rsquo;Thor. Galina might have satisfied the
Hall, possibly, but I doubt Covarla will; they will want someone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;higher&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to pay. And sooner or later, we will all learn
Toveine&rsquo;s fate. It will be difficult to keep this on your
shoulders then.&rdquo; Casually, she adjusted the Amyrlin&rsquo;s stole
around Elaida&rsquo;s neck. &ldquo;In fact, it will be impossible if they
learn any time soon. You will be stilled, made an example, the way
you wanted to make Siuan Sanche. But there might be time to
recover, if you listen to your Keeper. You must take good
advice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elaida&rsquo;s tongue felt frozen. The threat could
not have been clearer. &ldquo;What you have heard tonight is Sealed to
the Flame,&rdquo; she said thickly, but she knew that the words were
useless before they were out of her mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you mean to reject my advice&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Alviarin
paused, then began to turn away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Elaida pulled down the hand she had stretched
out unaware. Stripped of the stole. Stilled. Even after that, they
would make her howl. &ldquo;What&mdash;?&rdquo; She had to stop and swallow. &ldquo;What advice does my Keeper offer?&rdquo; There had to be some way to
stop this.</p>

<p>Sighing, Alviarin came close again. Closer, in fact;
much too near for anyone to stand to the Amyrlin, their skirts
almost touching. &ldquo;First, I fear you must abandon Toveine to
whatever comes, for the moment at least. And also Galina and
whoever else was taken prisoner, whether by the Aiel or the
Asha&rsquo;man. Any attempted rescue now must mean discovery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elaida nodded slowly. &ldquo;Yes. I can see that.&rdquo; She
could not take her horrified eyes away from the other woman&rsquo;s
demanding gaze. There had to be a way! This could not be
happening!</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I think it is time to reconsider your decision
about the Tower Guard. Don&rsquo;t you really think the Guard should
be increased after all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;can see my way clear to do that.&rdquo; Light,
she had to think!</p>

<p>&ldquo;So good,&rdquo; Alviarin murmured, and Elaida flushed with
helpless rage. &ldquo;Tomorrow, you will personally search Josaine&rsquo;s
rooms, and Adelorna&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why under the Light would I&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman tugged her striped stole again, roughly
this time, almost as if to yank it off or saw through her neck with
it. &ldquo;It seems that Josaine found an <em>angreal</em> some years ago
and never turned it in. Adelorna did worse, I fear. She removed
an <em>angreal</em> from one of the storerooms without permission.
When you have found them, you will announce their punishment
immediately. Something quite stiff. And at the same time you will
hold up Doraise, Kiyoshi and Farellien as models of preserving the
law. You will give each a present; a fine new horse will do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elaida wondered whether her eyes were going to pop
right out of her face. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; From time to time a sister kept an
<em>angreal</em> to herself in defiance of the law, but the penance
was seldom more than a stern slap on the knuckles. Every sister
knew the temptation. And the rest! The effect was obvious. Everyone
would believe Doraise and Kiyoshi and Farellien had exposed the
other two. Josaine and Adelorna were Green, the others Brown, Gray
and Yellow respectively. The Green Ajah would be furious. They
might even try to get back at the others, which would incite those
Ajahs, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;Why do you want to do this, Alviarin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elaida, it should be enough for you that it is my
advice.&rdquo; Mocking, honeyed ice suddenly turned to cold iron. &ldquo;I want
to hear you say that you will do as you are told. There&rsquo;s no
point in me working to keep the stole on your neck, otherwise. Say
it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; Elaida tried to look away. Oh, Light, she
had to think! Her belly was clenched in a knot. &ldquo;I will&mdash;do&mdash;as I&mdash;am told.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alviarin smiled that chilly smile. &ldquo;You see, that did
not hurt very much.&rdquo; Suddenly she stepped back, spreading her
skirts in a moderate curtsy. &ldquo;With your permission, I will withdraw
and let you find some sleep in what remains of the night. You have
an early morning ahead, with orders to issue for High Captain
Chubain and apartments to search. We have to decide when to let the
Tower know about the Asha&rsquo;man, too.&rdquo; Her tone made it clear
that she would decide. &ldquo;And perhaps we should begin planning our
next move against al&rsquo;Thor. It is about time the Tower stood
openly and called him to heel, don&rsquo;t you think? Think well. I
give you good night, Elaida.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dazed, wanting to sick up, Elaida watched her go.
Stand openly? That would <em>invite</em> attack by these&mdash;what had the woman called them?&mdash;these Asha&rsquo;man. This
could not be happening to her. Not to her! Before she realized what
she was doing, she hurled the goblet across the room to shatter
against a tapestry of flowers. Seizing the pitcher with both hands,
she raised it overhead with a shriek of fury and flung that too, in
a spray of punch. The Foretelling had been so certain! She would&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!</p>

<p>Abruptly she stopped, frowning at the tiny shards of
crystals clinging to the tapestry, the larger pieces scattered
across the floor. The Foretelling. Surely that had spoken of her
triumph. <em>Her</em> triumph! Alviarin might have her minor
victory, but the future belonged to Elaida. As long as Alviarin
could be gotten rid of. But it had to be done quietly, in some way
so that even the Hall would want silence. A way that would not
point to Elaida until it was too late, should Alviarin&rsquo;s sails
gain wind. And suddenly the why came to her. Alviarin would not
believe if she was told. No one would.</p>

<p>Could Alviarin have seen her smile then, the
woman&rsquo;s knees would have turned to jelly. Before she was done,
Alviarin would envy Galina, alive or dead.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Pausing in the hallway outside Elaida&rsquo;s
apartments, Alviarin studied her hands by the light of the
stand-lamps. They did not shake, which surprised her. She had
expected the woman to fight harder, to resist longer. But it was
begun, and she had nothing to fear. Unless Elaida learned that no
fewer than five Ajahs had passed mention of al&rsquo;Thor to her in
the last few days; the deposing of Colavaere had sent every
Ajah&rsquo;s agent in Cairhien flying for a pen. No, if Elaida did
learn, she was safe enough, with the hold she had on the woman now.
And with Mesaana as patron. Elaida, though, was finished whether
she realized or not. Even if the Asha&rsquo;man failed to trumpet
their crushing of Toveine&rsquo;s expedition&mdash;and she was sure
they would crush it, after what Mesaana had told her of events of
Dumai&rsquo;s Wells&mdash;all the eyes-and-ears in Caemlyn truly
would gain wings once they learned. Lacking a miracle, such as the
rebels appearing at the gates, Elaida would suffer Siuan
Sanche&rsquo;s fate in a matter of weeks. In any case, it had begun,
and if she wished she knew what &ldquo;it&rdquo; was, all she really had to do
was obey. And watch. And learn. Perhaps she would wear the
seven-striped stole herself when all was done.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">In the early morning sunlight streaming through her
windows, Seaine dipped the pen, but before she could write the next
word, the door to the hall opened and the Amyrlin swept in.
Seaine&rsquo;s thick black eyebrows rose; she would have expected
anyone else at all before Elaida, perhaps not excluding Rand
al&rsquo;Thor himself. Still, she set the pen down and rose
smoothly, pulling down the silver-white sleeves she had pushed up
to keep clear of the ink. She made the degree of curtsy proper to
the Amyrlin Seat from a Sitter in her own apartments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do hope you haven&rsquo;t found any White sisters
hiding away <em>angreal</em>, Mother.&rdquo; She did hope it, quite
fervently. Elaida&rsquo;s descent on the Greens a few hours ago,
while most of them slept, was probably still producing wails and
gnashing of teeth. In living memory no one had been ordered birched
for keeping back an <em>angreal</em>, and now there were to be two.
The Amyrlin must have been in one of her infamous cold furies.</p>

<p>But if she had been then, no sign of it remained now.
For a moment she regarded Seaine silently, cool as a winter pond in
her red-slashed silks, then glided to the carved sideboard where
painted ivory miniatures of Seaine&rsquo;s family stood. All years
dead, but she still loved every one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not stand to raise me Amyrlin,&rdquo; Elaida said,
picking up the picture of Seaine&rsquo;s father. She set it down
hastily and took up her mother instead.</p>

<p>Seaine&rsquo;s eyebrows almost rose again, but she
tried to make it a rule not to let herself be surprised more than
once in a day. &ldquo;I was not informed that the Hall was sitting until
afterward, Mother.&rdquo; After all these years, a touch of Lugard still
clung to her voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes.&rdquo; Abandoning the paintings, Elaida glided
to the fireplace. Seaine had always had a fondness for cats, and
carved wooden cats of every sort crowded the mantelpiece, some in
amusing poses. The Amyrlin frowned at the display, then squeezed
her eyes shut and gave her head a tiny shake. &ldquo;But you remained,&rdquo;
she said, turning quickly. &ldquo;Every Sitter who was not informed fled
the Tower and joined the rebels. Except you. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seaine spread her hands. &ldquo;What else could I do but
stay, Mother? The Tower must be whole.&rdquo; <em>Whoever the
Amyrlin</em>, she added to herself. <em>And what&rsquo;s wrong with
my cats, if I may ask?</em> Not that she ever would aloud, of
course. Sereille Bagand had been a fierce Mistress of Novices
before being raised Amyrlin Seat, the very year she herself earned
the shawl, and a fiercer Amyrlin than Elaida could be with a sore
tooth. Seaine had had the proprieties driven into her too hard and
deep for mere years to shift, or any dislike for the woman who wore
the stole. One did not have to like an Amyrlin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Tower must be whole,&rdquo; Elaida agreed, rubbing her
hands together. &ldquo;It must be whole.&rdquo; Now, why was she nervous? She
had ninety-nine kinds of temper, all hard as a knife and twice as
sharp, but nervous the woman was not. &ldquo;What I say to you now is
Sealed to the Flame, Seaine.&rdquo; Her mouth twisted wryly, and she
shrugged, giving her stole an irritable twitch. &ldquo;If I knew how to
make the seal stronger, I would,&rdquo; she said, dry as yesterday&rsquo;s
dust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will hold your words in my heart, Mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you&mdash;I command you&mdash;to undertake
an inquiry. And you must indeed hold it in your heart. The wrong
ear hearing of it might mean death, and disaster for the whole
Tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seaine&rsquo;s eyebrows twitched. Death and disaster
for the whole Tower? &ldquo;In my heart,&rdquo; she said again. &ldquo;Will you sit
yourself, Mother?&rdquo; That was proper, in her own apartments. &ldquo;May I
pour you some mint tea? Or plum punch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Waving away the offer of refreshment, Elaida took the
most comfortable chair, carved by Seaine&rsquo;s father as a gift
when she received the shawl, though of course the cushions had been
replaced many times since. The Amyrlin made the country chair seem
a throne, all stiff back and iron countenance. Most ungraciously,
she did not give permission for Seaine to sit, too, so Seaine
folded her hands and remained standing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have thought long and hard on treason, Seaine,
since my predecessor and her Keeper were allowed to escape. Helped
to escape. Treason must have been at the core of that, and I fear
only a sister, or sisters, could have effected it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would certainly be a possibility, Mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elaida frowned at the interruption. &ldquo;We can never be
sure who has the shadow of treason in her heart, Seaine. Why, I
suspect that someone arranged for an order of mine to be
countermanded. And I have reason to believe that someone has
communicated privately with Rand al&rsquo;Thor; to what end, I
cannot say, but that surely is treason against me, and against the
Tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seaine waited for more, but the Amyrlin only looked
back at her, slowly smoothing her red-slashed skirts. &ldquo;Exactly what
inquiry do you wish me to make, Mother?&rdquo; she asked cautiously.</p>

<p>Elaida bounded to her feet. &ldquo;I charge you to follow
the stench of treason, no matter where it leads or how high, even
to the Keeper herself. Yes, even to her. What you find, whoever it
leads to, you will bring before the Amyrlin Seat alone, Seaine. No
one else must know. Do you understand me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand your commands, Mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which, she thought, once Elaida had departed even
more swiftly than she had come, was about all she did understand.
In order to think she took the chair the Amyrlin had vacated, fists
pressed beneath her chin in just the way her father had always sat
thinking. Everything fell to logic, eventually.</p>

<p>She would not have stood against Siuan Sanche&mdash;she had proposed the girl as Amyrlin in the first place!&mdash;but
once it was done and all the forms were followed, however sparely,
aiding her escape certainly had been treason, and deliberately
countermanding an Amyrlin&rsquo;s order just as much. Possibly
communicating with al&rsquo;Thor was, too; that depended on what was
communicated, with what intent. Finding who had changed the
Amyrlin&rsquo;s command would be difficult without knowing what
command. At this late date learning who might have helped Siuan
escape stood about as much chance of success as learning who might
be writing to al&rsquo;Thor. So many pigeons flew into and out of
the Tower cotes every day that at times the sky seemed to be
raining feathers. If Elaida knew more than she had said, she had
certainly gone around the barn. This all made very little sense.
Treason ought to make Elaida boil with rage, but she had not been
angry. She had been nervous. And anxious to be gone. And secretive,
as if she did not want to tell everything she knew or suspected.
Almost as though she was afraid to. What kind of treason would make
Elaida nervous or afraid? Death and disaster for the whole
Tower.</p>

<p>Like the pieces of a blacksmith&rsquo;s puzzle, all
fell into place, and Seaine&rsquo;s eyebrows tried to climb onto her
scalp. It fit; it all fit. She felt the blood draining from her
face; her hands and feet were suddenly icy. Sealed to the Flame.
She had said she would keep this in her heart, but everything had
changed since she spoke those words. She only let herself be afraid
when it was logical to be, and right then, she was terrified. She
could not face this alone. But who? Under the circumstances, who?
This answer came much more easily. Gathering herself took a little
time, but she hurried from her rooms and out of the White quarters
walking a good deal faster than she usually did.</p>

<p>Servants scurried through the corridors as always,
though she walked so quickly that she was past most before they
could begin bow or curtsy, but there seemed fewer sisters about
than the early hour could account for. Many fewer. Yet if most were
staying close to their quarters for some reason, the few she saw
made up for it in one way. Sisters swarmed along the tapestry-hung
hallways, faces all serenity, and their eyes seemed to have steam
behind them. Here and there two or three women spoke together, with
sharp eyes darting to see who might be listening. Always two or
three of the same Ajah. Even yesterday, she was sure she had still
seen women sharing friendship between Ajahs. Whites were supposed
to put emotion away entirely, but she had never seen the reason for
blinding herself, as some did. Suspicion made the air in the Tower
like hot jelly. Not a new thing, unfortunately&mdash;the Amyrlin
had begun it with her harsh measures, and the rumors about Logain
had only exacerbated the situation&mdash;but this morning seemed
worse than ever.</p>

<p>Talene Minly came around a corner ahead of her, her
shawl not just across her shoulders, but spread down her arms as
though to display the green fringe. For that matter, she realized
that every Green she had seen this morning wore her shawl. Talene,
golden-baked and statuesque and lovely, had stood to depose Siuan,
but she had come to the Tower while Seaine was Accepted, and that
decision had not dented their long friendship. Talene had had
reasons Seaine accepted if not agreed with. Today, her friend
stopped, watching her warily. So many sisters seemed to watch one
another that way of late. Another time, she would have stopped, but
not with what made her head want to burst open like a spoiled
melon. Talene was a friend, and she thought she could be sure of
her, but thinking was not enough for this. Later, if possible, she
would approach Talene. Hoping it would be possible, she hurried
past with only a nod.</p>

<p>In the Red quarters, the mood was even worse, the air
thicker. As with the other Ajahs, there were many more rooms than
there were sisters to fill them now&mdash;that had been so long
before the first rebel fled&mdash;but the Red was the largest of
the Ajahs, and sisters filled the levels still in use. Reds
frequently wore their shawls when there was no need, but now every
last woman sported her red fringe like a banner. Conversations
stopped as Seaine approached, and cold eyes followed her in a
bubble of icy silence. She felt an invader deep in enemy country as
she crossed those peculiar floor tiles, white with the teardrop
Flame of Tar Valon in red. But then, any part of the Tower might be
enemy country. Looking another way, those scarlet flames might be
taken for red Dragon&rsquo;s Fangs. She had never believed those
irrational tales about the Reds and false Dragons, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Why
would none of them deny it?</p>

<p>She had to ask directions. &ldquo;I will not disturb her if
she is busy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We were close friends once, and I would
like us to be again. Now more than ever, the Ajahs cannot afford to
drift apart.&rdquo; All true, though the Ajahs seemed to splitting apart
rather than drifting, but the Domani woman listened with a face
that could have been cast in copper. There were not many Domani
Reds, and those few usually meaner than snakes caught in a
fence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will show you, Sitter,&rdquo; the woman said at last,
and not very respectfully. She led the way, then watched while
Seaine knocked on the door, as though she could not be trusted here
alone. The door panels were carved with the Flame, too, lacquered
the color of fresh blood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; a brisk voice called from within. Seaine
opened the door hoping she was right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seaine!&rdquo; Pevara exclaimed cheerfully. &ldquo;What brings
you here this morning? Come! Shut the door and sit!&rdquo; It was as if
all the years since they were novice and Accepted together had
melted away. Quite plump and not tall&mdash;in truth, for a
Kandori, she was short&mdash;Pevara was also quite pretty, with a
merry twinkle in her dark eyes and a ready smile. It was sad that
she had chosen Red, no matter how good her reasons, because she
still liked men. The Red did attract women who were naturally
suspicious of men, of course, but others chose it because the task
of finding men who could channel was important. Whether they liked
men, or disliked them, or did not care one way or the other in the
beginning, however, not many women could belong to the Red for long
without taking a jaundiced view of all men. Seaine had reason to
believe Pevara had served a penance shortly after attaining the
shawl for saying that she wished she had a Warder; since reaching
the safer heights of the Hall, she had openly said Warders would
make the Red Ajah&rsquo;s work easier. Not that that had any part in
Seaine trusting her. Of all the sisters in the Tower, though,
Pevara was the one she was sure she <em>could</em> trust with
this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell you how happy I am to see you,&rdquo; Pevara
said once they were ensconced in armchairs carved in the spirals
popular in Kandor a hundred years ago, with delicate,
butterfly-painted cups of blueberry tea in hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often
thought how I should go to you, but I admit to fearing what you
would say after I gave you the cut direct so many years ago. Sworn
on the blade, Seaine, I&rsquo;d not have done it, except Tesien
Jorhald practically had me by the scruff of my neck, and I was too
new to the shawl to have much backbone yet. Can you forgive
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, I can,&rdquo; Seaine replied. &ldquo;I understood.&rdquo;
The Red firmly discouraged friendships outside the Ajah. Quite
firmly, and quite efficiently. &ldquo;We cannot go against our Ajahs when
we are young and later, it seems impossible to retrace our steps. A
thousand times I&rsquo;ve remembered us whispering together after
Last&mdash;oh, and the pranks! do you recall when we dusted
Serancha&rsquo;s shift with powdered itchoak?&mdash;but I&rsquo;m
shamed to say it took being terrified out of my wits to stir my
feet. I do want us to be friends again, but I need your help, too.
You are the only one I&rsquo;m sure I can trust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Serancha was a prig then, and still is.&rdquo; Pevara
laughed. &ldquo;The Gray is a good place for her. But I can&rsquo;t
believe you terrified at anything. Why, you never decided it was
logical to be afraid until we were back in our beds. Short of a
promise to stand in the Hall without knowing what for, whatever
help I can give is yours, Seaine. What do you need?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brought to the point, Seaine hesitated, sipping her
tea. Not that she had any doubts about Pevara, but pushing the
words out of her mouth was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;difficult. &ldquo;The Amyrlin came to
see me this morning,&rdquo; she said finally. &ldquo;She instructed me to make
an inquiry, Sealed to the Flame.&rdquo; Pevara frowned slightly, but she
did not say that in that case Seaine should not be speaking of it.
Seaine might have planned how to carry out most of their pranks as
girls, but Pevara had been the one with the audacity to think most
of them up, and she had provided most of the nerve to go through
with them. &ldquo;She was very circumspect, but after a little thought,
it was clear to me what she wanted. I am to hunt out&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; At the
last, courage failed her tongue. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Darkfriends in the
Tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pevara&rsquo;s eyes, as dark as her own were blue,
became stone, and swept to the mantel above her fireplace, where
miniatures of her own family made a precise line. They had all died
while she was a novice, parents, brothers and sisters, aunts,
uncles and all, murdered in a quickly suppressed uprising of
Darkfriends who had become convinced the Dark One was about to
break free. That was why Seaine had been sure she could trust her.
That was why Pevara had chosen Red&mdash;though Seaine still
thought she could have done as well and been happier as a Green&mdash;because she believed a Red hunting men who could channel had
the best chance of finding Darkfriends. She had been very good at
it; that plump exterior covered a core of steel. And she possessed
the courage to say calmly what Seaine had been unable to bring
herself to utter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Black Ajah. Well. No wonder Elaida would be
circumspect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pevara, I know she&rsquo;s always denied its
existence harder than any three other sisters combined, but
I&rsquo;m certain sure that&rsquo;s what she meant, and if she is
convinced&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her friend waved her off. &ldquo;You have no need to
convince me, Seaine. I have been sure the Black Ajah exists for&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Strangely, Pevara became hesitant, peering into her teacup like
a fortune-teller at a fair. &ldquo;What do you know of events right after
the Aiel War?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two Amyrlins dying suddenly in the space of five
years,&rdquo; Seaine said carefully. She assumed the other woman meant
events in the Tower. Truth to tell, until being raised a Sitter
nearly fifteen years ago, just a year after Pevara, she had not
given much attention to anything outside the Tower. And not that
much inside, really. &ldquo;A great many sisters died in those years, as
I recall. Do you mean to say you think the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the Black Ajah had
a hand in that?&rdquo; There; she had said it, and the name had not
burned her tongue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Pevara said softly, shaking her
head &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done well to wrap yourself deep in philosophy.
There were&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;things&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;done then, and Sealed to the Flame.&rdquo;
She drew a troubled breath.</p>

<p>Seaine did not press her; she herself had committed
something akin to treason by breaking that same seal, and Pevara
would have to decide on her own. &ldquo;Looking at reports will be safer
than asking questions with no idea who we&rsquo;re really asking.
Logically, a Black sister must be able to lie despite the Oaths.&rdquo;
Otherwise, the Black Ajah would have been revealed long since. That
name seemed to be coming more easily with use. &ldquo;If any sister wrote
that she did one thing when we can prove she did another, then we
have found a Darkfriend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pevara nodded. &ldquo;Yes. Perhaps the Black Ajah has no
hand in the rebellion, but I cannot think they would let this
turmoil pass without taking advantage. We must look closely at this
last year, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To that, Seaine agreed reluctantly. There would be
fewer pieces of paper to read and more questions to ask concerning
recent months. Deciding who else to make part of the inquiry was
even harder. Especially after Pevara said, &ldquo;You were very brave
coming to me, Seaine. I&rsquo;ve known Darkfriends to kill brothers,
sisters, parents, to try hiding who they are and what they&rsquo;ve
done. I love you for it, but you were very brave indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seaine shivered as if a goose had walked on her
grave. Had she wanted to be brave, she would have chosen Green. She
almost wished Elaida had gone to someone else. There was no turning
back now, though.</p>
