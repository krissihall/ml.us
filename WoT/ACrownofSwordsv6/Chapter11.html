<h4><em>An Oath</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">Y</span>ou asked to be wakened before the sun, Mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene&rsquo;s eyes popped open&mdash;she had set
herself a time to wake only moments from now&mdash;and despite
herself she started back against her pillow from the face above
her. Stern through a sheen of perspiration, it was not a pleasant
sight first thing in the morning. Meri&rsquo;s manner was perfectly
respectful, but a pinched nose, a permanently downturned mouth and
dark eyes sharp with censure said she had never seen anyone half as
good as they should be or pretended to be, and her flat tone turned
every meaning head to heels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you slept well, Mother,&rdquo; she said, while her
expression managed a fair accusation of sloth. Her black hair, in
tight coils over her ears, seemed to pull her face painfully. The
unrelieved drab dark gray she always wore, however it made her
sweat, only added to the gloom.</p>

<p>It was a pity she had not managed a little real rest.
Yawning, Egwene rose from her narrow cot and scrubbed her teeth
with salt, washed her face and hands while Meri laid out her
clothes for the day, donned stockings and a clean shift, then
suffered herself to be dressed. &ldquo;Suffered&rdquo; was the word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear some of these knots will pull, Mother,&rdquo; the
cheerless woman murmured, drawing the brush through Egwene&rsquo;s
hair, and Egwene very nearly told her she had not deliberately
tangled it in her sleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand we will rest here today, Mother.&rdquo; Bone
idleness, seethed Meri&rsquo;s reflection in the stand-mirror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This shade of blue will set off your coloring
nicely, Mother,&rdquo; Meri said as she did up Egwene&rsquo;s buttons, her
face an accusation of vanity.</p>

<p>Filled with relief that she would have Chesa tonight,
Egwene donned the stole and fled almost before the woman
finished.</p>

<p>Not even a rim of the sun showed above the hills to
the east. The land humped up all around in long ridges and
irregular mounds, sometimes hundreds of feet high, that often
looked as though monstrous fingers had squeezed them. Shadows like
twilight bathed the camp lying in one of the broad valleys between,
but it was well awake in the heat that never really lifted. Smells
of breakfast cooking filled the air, and people bustled about,
though there was none of the rush that would have meant a
day&rsquo;s marching ahead. White-clad novices darted about at a
near run; a wise novice always carried out her chores as quickly as
she could. Warders never seemed hurried, of course, but even
servants carrying the morning meal to Aes Sedai appeared to stroll
this morning. Well, almost. In comparison to the novices. The whole
camp was taking advantage of the halt. A clatter and curses as a
jack-lever slipped announced wagonwrights making repairs, and a
distant tapping of hammers told of farriers reshoeing horses. A
dozen candlemakers had their molds lined up already, and the
kettles heating to melt the carefully hoarded drippings and
tag-ends of every candle that had been burned. More big black
kettles stood on fires to boil water for baths and laundry, and men
and women were heaping clothes up nearby. Egwene gave little notice
to any of the activity.</p>

<p>The thing of it was, she was certain Meri did not do
it apurpose; she could not help her face. Even so, she was as bad
as it would be to have Romanda for a maid. The thought made her
laugh out loud. Romanda as lady&rsquo;s maid would have her mistress
toeing the line in no time; no doubt as to who would run and fetch
in <em>that</em> pair. A gray-haired cook paused in raking coals
from atop an iron oven to give her a grin of shared amusement. For
a moment, anyway. Then he realized he was grinning at the Amyrlin
Seat, not just some young woman walking by, and the grin melted
crookedly as he jerked a bow before bending back to his work.</p>

<p>If she sent Meri off, Romanda would only find a new
spy. And Meri would again be starving her way from village to
village. Adjusting her dress&mdash;she really had gone before the
woman was quite finished&mdash;Egwene&rsquo;s fingers found a small
linen bag, the strings tucked behind her belt. She did not have to
lift it all the way to her nose to smell rose petals and a blend of
herbs with a cool scent. It made her sigh. A face like a
headsman&rsquo;s, spying for Romanda without any doubt, and trying
to perform her duties as well as she could. Why were these things
never easy?</p>

<p>Approaching the tent she used as a study&mdash;many
called it the Amyrlin&rsquo;s study, as if it were rooms in the
Tower&mdash;a solemn satisfaction replaced worry over Meri.
Whenever they halted for a day, Sheriam would be there before her
with fat sheaves of petitions. A laundress imploring clemency on a
charge of theft when she had been caught with the jewelry sewn into
her dress, or a blacksmith begging a testimonial for his work,
which he could not use unless he intended to leave, and likely not
then. A harness maker asking the Amyrlin&rsquo;s prayers for her to
give birth to a daughter. One of Lord Bryne&rsquo;s soldiers
requesting the Amyrlin&rsquo;s personal blessing to his wedding a
seamstress. There was always a slew from older novices, appealing
visits to Tiana and even extra chores. Anyone had the right to
petition the Amyrlin, but those in service to the Tower seldom did,
and never novices. Egwene suspected that Sheriam worked to dig up
petitioners, something to butter the cat&rsquo;s paws, to keep her
out of Sheriam&rsquo;s hair while the Keeper took care of what she
considered important. This morning, Egwene thought she might make
Sheriam eat those petitions for her breakfast.</p>

<p>When she entered the tent, though, Sheriam was not
there. Which perhaps should not have been a surprise, given the
night before. The tent was not empty, however.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light illumine you this morning, Mother,&rdquo;
Theodrin said, making a deep curtsy that set the brown fringe of
her shawl swaying. She had all the fabled Domani grace, though her
high-necked dress was really quite modest. Domani women were not
known for modesty. &ldquo;We did as you commanded, but no one saw anybody
near Marigan&rsquo;s tent last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of the men remembered seeing Halima,&rdquo; Faolain
added sourly, with a much briefer bend of her knees, &ldquo;but aside
from that, they hardly recalled whether they went to sleep.&rdquo; Many
women disapproved of Delana&rsquo;s secretary, but it was her next
remark that made Faolain&rsquo;s round face darker than usual. &ldquo;We
met Tiana while we were roaming about. She told us to go to bed and
be quick about it.&rdquo; Unconsciously she stroked the blue fringe on
her shawl. New Aes Sedai almost always wore their shawls more often
than they needed to, so Siuan said.</p>

<p>Giving them a smile she hoped was welcoming, Egwene
took her place behind the small table. Carefully; the chair tilted
for a moment anyway, until she reached down and pulled the leg
straight. An edge of folded parchment peeked out from beneath the
stone inkwell. Her hands twitched toward it, but she made them be
still. Too many sisters saw little need for courtesy. She would not
be one of those. Besides, these two had a claim on her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry for your difficulties, daughters.&rdquo; Made
Aes Sedai by her decree on being raised Amyrlin, they faced the
same predicament as she, but lacking the added shield of the
Amyrlin&rsquo;s stole, small shield that that had proved. Most
sisters behaved as though they were still only Accepted. What went
on inside the Ajahs was seldom known outside, but it was rumored
that they truly had had to beg admittance, and that guardians had
been named to oversee their behavior. No one had ever heard the
like, but everyone took it for fact. She had done them no favor.
Another thing that had been necessary, though. &ldquo;I will speak to
Tiana.&rdquo; It might do some good. For a day, or an hour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mother,&rdquo; Theodrin said, &ldquo;but there is no
need to bother yourself.&rdquo; Still, she also touched her shawl, hands
lingering. &ldquo;Tiana wanted to know why we were up so late,&rdquo; she added
after a moment, &ldquo;but we didn&rsquo;t tell her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was no need for secrecy, daughter.&rdquo; A pity
they had not found a witness, though. Moghedien&rsquo;s rescuer
would remain a shadow half-glimpsed. Always the most frightening
sort. She glanced at the tiny corner of parchment, itching to read
it. Maybe Siuan had discovered something. &ldquo;Thank you both.&rdquo;
Theodrin recognized a dismissal and made her manners to go, but
stopped when Faolain remained where she was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I had held the Oath Rod already,&rdquo; Faolain
told Egwene in tones of frustration, &ldquo;so you could know what I say
is true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t the time to bother the Amyrlin,&rdquo;
Theodrin began, then folded her hands and turned her attention to
Egwene. Patience blended with something else on her face. Clearly
the stronger of the two in the Power, she always took the lead, yet
this time she was prepared to step back. In aid of what, Egwene
wondered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the Oath Rod that makes a woman Aes
Sedai, daughter.&rdquo; Whatever some believed. &ldquo;Speak the truth to me,
and I will believe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like you.&rdquo; Faolain&rsquo;s mop of dark
curls swayed as she shook her head for emphasis. &ldquo;You must know
that. You probably think I was mean when you were a novice, when
you came back to the White Tower after running away, but I still
believe you didn&rsquo;t get half the punishment you should have.
Maybe my admitting it will help you know I speak the truth. It
isn&rsquo;t as though we have no choice even now. Romanda offered to
take us under her protection, and so did Lelaine. They said
they&rsquo;d see we were tested and raised properly as soon we
return to the Tower.&rdquo; Her face grew angrier, and Theodrin rolled
her eyes and broke in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, what Faolain is fumbling all around without
getting to the point is that we didn&rsquo;t attach ourselves to you
because we had no choice. And we didn&rsquo;t do it in gratitude for
the shawl.&rdquo; She pursed her lips as if thinking that raising them
Aes Sedai in the manner Egwene had was not really a gift to inspire
much gratitude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why?&rdquo; Egwene asked, leaning back. The chair
shifted, but held.</p>

<p>Faolain jumped in before Theodrin could more than
open her mouth. &ldquo;Because you are the Amyrlin Seat.&rdquo; She still
sounded angry. &ldquo;We can see what happens. Some of the sisters think
you&rsquo;re Sheriam&rsquo;s puppet, but most believe Romanda or
Lelaine tells you where and when to step. It is not right.&rdquo; Her
face was twisted in a scowl. &ldquo;I left the Tower because what Elaida
did wasn&rsquo;t right. They raised you Amyrlin. So I am yours. If
you will have me. If you can trust me without the Oath Rod. You
must believe me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, Theodrin?&rdquo; Egwene said quickly, schooling
her face. Knowing how the sisters felt was bad enough; hearing it
again was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;painful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am yours, too,&rdquo; Theodrin sighed, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll
have me.&rdquo; She spread her hands disparagingly. &ldquo;We are not much, I
know, but it looks as though we are all you have. I must admit I
was hesitant, Mother. Faolain is the one who kept insisting we do
this. Frankly&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She settled her shawl again unnecessarily,
and her voice firmed. &ldquo;Frankly, I do not see how you can win out
over Romanda and Lelaine. But we are trying to behave as Aes Sedai,
even though we aren&rsquo;t really, yet. We will not be that,
Mother, whatever you say, until the other sisters see us as Aes
Sedai, and that won&rsquo;t happen until we have been tested and
have sworn the Three Oaths.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Plucking the folded scrap of parchment out from under
the inkwell, Egwene fingered it while she thought. Faolain was the
driving force behind this? That seemed as unlikely as a wolf
befriending the shepherd. She suspected &ldquo;dislike&rdquo; was a mild word
for what Faolain felt for her, and the woman must know Egwene
hardly saw her as a potential friend. If they had accepted either
Sitter&rsquo;s arrangement, mentioning the offer might be a good
means of disarming her suspicions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; Faolain said, and stopped, looking
surprised at herself. It was the first time she had addressed
Egwene so. Drawing a deep breath, she went on. &ldquo;Mother, I know you
must have a hard time believing us, since we&rsquo;ve never held the
Oath Rod, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you would stop bringing that up,&rdquo; Egwene
said. It was well to be careful, but she could not afford to refuse
every offer of help for fear of plots. &ldquo;Do you think everybody
believes Aes Sedai because of the Three Oaths? People who know Aes
Sedai know a sister can stand truth on its head and turn it inside
out if she chooses to. Myself, I think the Three Oaths hurt as much
as they help, maybe more. I will believe you until I learn
you&rsquo;ve lied to me, and I will trust you until you show you
don&rsquo;t deserve it. The same way everybody else does with one
another.&rdquo; Come to think of it, the Oaths did not really change
that. You still had to take a sister on trust most of the time. The
Oaths just made people warier about it, wondering whether and how
they were being manipulated. &ldquo;Another thing. You two <em>are</em> Aes Sedai.
I don&rsquo;t want to hear any more about having to be tested, or
hold the Oath Rod, or any of it. Bad enough you have to face that
nonsense without parroting it yourselves. Have I made myself
clear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two women standing on the other side of the table
murmured hastily that she had, then exchanged long looks. This
time, it was Faolain who appeared indecisive. Finally, Theodrin
glided around to kneel beside Egwene&rsquo;s chair and kiss her
ring. &ldquo;Under the Light and by my hope of salvation and rebirth, I,
Theodrin Dabei, swear fealty to you, Egwene al&rsquo;Vere, to
faithfully serve and obey on pain of my life and honor.&rdquo; She looked
at Egwene questioningly.</p>

<p>It was all Egwene could do to nod. This was no part
of Aes Sedai ritual; this was how noble swore to ruler. Even some
rulers did not receive so strong an oath. Yet no sooner had
Theodrin risen with a relieved smile than Faolain took her
place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Under the Light and by my hope of salvation and
rebirth, I, Faolain Orande&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>All that she could have wished for and more. From any
other sisters, at least, who were not just as likely to be sent to
fetch another&rsquo;s dustcloak if the wind rose.</p>

<p>When Faolain finished, she remained kneeling, but
stiffly upright. &ldquo;Mother, there is the matter of my penance. For
what I said to you, about not liking you. I will set it myself, if
you wish, but it is your right.&rdquo; Her voice was as rigid as her
posture, yet not at all fearful. She looked ready to stare down a
lion. Eager to, in fact.</p>

<p>Biting her lip, Egwene nearly laughed aloud. Keeping
her face smooth took effort; maybe they would take it for a
hiccough. However much they claimed they were not really Aes Sedai,
Faolain had just proved how much of one she was. Sometimes sisters
set themselves penances, in order to maintain the proper balance
between pride and humility&mdash;that balance was much prized,
supposedly, and the only reason given usually&mdash;but certainly
none sought to have one imposed. Penance set by another could be
quite harsh, and the Amyrlin was supposed to be harder in this than
the Ajahs. Either way, though, many sisters made a haughty display
of submission to the greater will of the Aes Sedai, an arrogant
showing of their lack of arrogance. The pride of humility, Siuan
called it. She considered telling the woman to eat a handful of
soap just to see her expression&mdash;Faolain had a mean tongue&mdash;but instead&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hand out penance for telling the truth,
daughter. Or for not liking me. Dislike to your heart&rsquo;s
content, so long as you keep your oath.&rdquo; Not that anyone except a
Darkfriend would break that particular oath. Still, there were ways
around almost anything. But weak sticks were better than none, when
you were fending off a bear.</p>

<p>Faolain&rsquo;s eyes widened, and Egwene sighed as she
motioned the woman to rise. Had their positions been reversed,
Faolain <em>would</em> have put her nose firmly in the dust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m setting you two tasks to begin, daughters,&rdquo;
she went on.</p>

<p>They listened carefully, Faolain not even blinking,
Theodrin with a thoughtful finger to her lips, and this time when
she dismissed them, they said, &ldquo;As you command, Mother,&rdquo; in unison
as they curtsied.</p>

<p>Egwene&rsquo;s good mood was fleeting, though. Meri
arrived with her breakfast on a tray as Theodrin and Faolain
departed, and when Egwene thanked her for the rose-petal pomander,
she said, &ldquo;I had a few spare moments, Mother.&rdquo; By her expression,
that could have been an accusation that Egwene worked her too hard,
or that she herself did not work hard enough. Not a pleasant spice
for the stewed fruit. For that matter, the woman&rsquo;s face might
sour the mint tea and turn the warm crusty bun hard as a rock.
Egwene sent her away before eating. The tea was weak anyway. Tea
was one of the things in short supply.</p>

<p>The note that had been under the inkwell proved no
better seasoning. &ldquo;Nothing of interest in the dream,&rdquo; said
Siuan&rsquo;s fine script. So Siuan had been in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> last night too; she did a good deal
of spying there. It mattered little whether she had been hunting
some sign of Moghedien, though that would have been insanely
foolish, or something else; nothing was nothing.</p>

<p>Egwene grimaced, and not just for the &ldquo;nothing.&rdquo;
Siuan in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> last night meant a visit
from Leane sometime today, complaining. Siuan most definitely no
longer was allowed any of the dream <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, not
since she had tried to teach some of the other sisters about the
World of Dreams. It was not so much that she knew little more than
they, or even that few sisters believed they actually needed a
teacher to learn anything, but Siuan possessed a tongue like a rasp
and no patience. Usually she managed to hold her temper, but two
outbursts of shouting and fist-shaking, and she had been fortunate
just to find herself denied access to the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. Leane was given one whenever she asked,
though, and frequently Siuan used it in secret. That was one of the
few real bones of contention between them; both would have been in
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> every night if they could.</p>

<p>With a grimace Egwene channeled the tiniest spark of
Fire to set a corner of the parchment alight and held it until it
burned nearly to her fingers. Nothing left to be found by anyone
rooting through her belongings and reported where it would rouse
suspicions.</p>

<p>Breakfast almost done, she was still alone, and that
was not usual. Sheriam might well be avoiding her, but Siuan should
have been there. Popping a last bit of the bun into her mouth and
washing it down with a final swallow of tea, she rose to go find
her, only to have the object of her intended search stalk into the
tent. Had Siuan had a tail, she would have been lashing it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo; Egwene demanded, weaving a
ward against listeners.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aeldene pulled me out of my blankets first thing,&rdquo;
Siuan growled, dropping onto one of the stools. &ldquo;She still thinks
she&rsquo;ll pump the Amyrlin&rsquo;s eyes-and-ears out of me. No one
gets that! No one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Siuan had first arrived in Salidar, a stilled
woman on the run, a deposed Amyrlin the world thought dead, the
sisters might well not have let her stay except that she knew not
only the Amyrlin Seat&rsquo;s network of agents, but also that of
the Blue Ajah, which she had run before being raised to the stole.
That had given her a certain influence, just as Leane&rsquo;s agents
inside Tar Valon had given her some. The arrival of Aeldene
Stonebridge, who had taken her place with the Blue eyes-and-ears,
had changed matters for Siuan. Aeldene had been outraged that
reports from the handful of Blue agents Siuan had managed to reach
had been handed to women outside the Ajah. That Aeldene&rsquo;s own
position had been revealed&mdash;only two or three sisters were
supposed to know, even within the Blue&mdash;infuriated her to
near apoplexy. She not only snatched back control of the Blue
network, not only upbraided Siuan in a voice that might have been
heard a mile off, she very nearly went for Siuan&rsquo;s throat.
Aeldene was from an Andoran mining village in the Mountains of
Mist, and it was said her crooked nose came from fighting with her
fists when she was a girl. Aeldene&rsquo;s actions had started
others thinking.</p>

<p>Egwene returned to her unsteady chair and pushed her
breakfast tray aside. &ldquo;Aeldene won&rsquo;t take it away from you,
Siuan, and neither will anyone else.&rdquo; When Aeldene reclaimed the
Blue eyes-and-ears, others had begun thinking that the Blue should
not have the Amyrlin&rsquo;s as well. No one suggested that it
should be in Egwene&rsquo;s control. The Hall was to have it. So
Romanda said, and Lelaine. Each intended to be the one in charge,
of course, the one those reports came to first, for being first to
know had advantages. Aeldene thought those agents should be added
to the Blue network since Siuan was Blue. At least Sheriam was
content simply to be handed all the reports Siuan received. Which
she usually was. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t make you give it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene filled her teacup again, setting it and the
blue-glazed honeypot on the corner of the table nearest Siuan, but
the other woman only stared at them. The anger had gone out of her.
She slumped on the stool. &ldquo;You never really think about strength,&rdquo;
she said, half to herself. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re aware of it, whether
you&rsquo;re stronger than somebody else, but you don&rsquo;t think
about it. You just know that she defers to you, or you to her.
There was no one stronger than me, before. No one, since&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Her
eyes dropped to her hands, stirring uneasily on her lap. &ldquo;Sometimes, when Romanda is hammering at me, or Lelaine, it
suddenly hits me like a gale. They&rsquo;re so far above me now, I
should be holding my tongue until they give me permission to speak.
Even Aeldene is, and she&rsquo;s no more than middling.&rdquo; She forced
her head upright, mouth tight and voice bitter. &ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;m
adjusting to reality. That&rsquo;s ingrained in us, too, driven deep
before you ever test for the shawl. But I don&rsquo;t like it. I
don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene picked up her pen from beside the inkwell and
the sand jar, fiddling with it while she chose words. &ldquo;Siuan, you
know how I feel about what needs to be changed. There&rsquo;s too
much we do because Aes Sedai have always done it that way. But
things are changing, no matter who believes it will all go back to
how it was. I doubt anyone else was ever raised Amyrlin without
being Aes Sedai first!&rdquo; That should have elicited a comment on the
White Tower&rsquo;s hidden records&mdash;Siuan often said there was
nothing that had not occurred at least once in the Tower&rsquo;s
history, though this did seem to be a first&mdash;but Siuan sat
there disheartened, like a sack. &ldquo;Siuan, the Aes Sedai way
isn&rsquo;t the only way, and not even always the best. I intend to
make sure we follow the best way, and whoever can&rsquo;t learn to
change, or won&rsquo;t, had better learn to live with it.&rdquo; Leaning
across the table, she tried to make her expression encouraging. &ldquo;I
never did figure out how Wise Ones determine precedence, but it
isn&rsquo;t strength in the Power. There are women who can channel
who defer to women who can&rsquo;t. One, Sorilea, would never have
made it to Accepted, yet even the strongest jump when she says
toad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wilders,&rdquo; Siuan said dismissively, but it lacked
force.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aes Sedai, then. I wasn&rsquo;t raised Amyrlin
because I am the strongest. The wisest women are chosen for the
Hall or to be ambassadors or advisors, the most skillful anyway,
not those with the most strength.&rdquo; Best not to say skillful in
what, though Siuan certainly possessed those particular skills
too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Hall? The Hall might send me for tea. They might
have me sweep out when they&rsquo;ve finished sitting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sitting back, Egwene threw down the pen. She wanted
to shake the woman. Siuan had kept going when she could not channel
at all, and now her knees began to fold? Egwene was on the point of
telling her about Theodrin and Faolain&mdash;that should get some
rise, and approval&mdash;when she saw an olive-skinned woman ride
past the open tent flaps looking lost in thought beneath the wide
gray hat she wore to keep off the sun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Siuan, it&rsquo;s Myrelle.&rdquo; Letting the ward go, she
rushed outside. &ldquo;Myrelle,&rdquo; she called. Siuan needed a victory to
wash the taste of being bullied out of her mouth, and this might be
just the thing. Myrelle was one of Sheriam&rsquo;s lot, and
apparently with a secret all her own.</p>

<p>Reining in her sorrel gelding, Myrelle looked around,
and gave a start when she saw Egwene. By her expression, the Green
sister had not realized what part of the camp she was passing
through. A thin dustcloak hung down the back of her pale gray
riding dress. &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; she said hesitantly, &ldquo;if you will forgive
me, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not forgive you,&rdquo; Egwene cut in, making her
flinch. Any doubt vanished that Myrelle had heard about last night
from Sheriam. &ldquo;I will talk with you. Now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Siuan had come outside too, but instead of watching
the sister climb uneasily from her saddle, she stared down the rows
of tents toward a stocky, graying man with a battered breastplate
strapped over his buff-colored coat, leading a tall bay in their
direction. His presence was a surprise. Lord Bryne usually
communicated with the Hall by messenger, and his rare visits mostly
finished before Egwene learned he had come. Siuan assumed such a
look of Aes Sedai serenity it nearly made you forget her youthful
face.</p>

<p>Glancing briefly at Siuan, Bryne made a leg, handling
his sword with a spare grace. A weathered man, he was only
moderately tall, but the way he carried himself made him seem
taller. There was nothing flashy about him; the sweat on his broad
face made him seem to be about a job of work. &ldquo;Mother, may I speak
with you? Alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Myrelle turned as if to go, and Egwene snapped, &ldquo;You
stay right there! Right where you are!&rdquo; Myrelle&rsquo;s mouth
dropped open. Her surprise seemed as much for her own obedience as
Egwene&rsquo;s decisive tone, and it faded into bitter resignation
that she quickly hid behind a cool fa&ccedil;ade. One belied by the way
she twiddled her reins.</p>

<p>Bryne did not even blink, though Egwene was sure he
at least had an inkling of her situation. She suspected that very
little surprised him, or unsettled him. Just the sight of him had
made Siuan ready to fight back, for all it was apparently she who
started most of their arguments. Already her fists rested on her
hips and her gaze was fixed on him, an auguring stare that should
have made anyone uneasy even had it not come from an Aes Sedai.
Myrelle offered more than helping Siuan, though. Perhaps. &ldquo;I
intended to ask you to come this afternoon, Lord Bryne. I ask now.&rdquo;
She had questions to put to him. &ldquo;We can talk then. If you will
forgive me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instead of accepting her dismissal, he said, &ldquo;Mother,
one of my patrols found something just before dawn, something I
think you should see for yourself. I can have an escort ready in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No need for that,&rdquo; she broke in quickly. &ldquo;Myrelle,
you will come with us. Siuan, would you ask someone to bring my
horse, please? Without delay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Riding out with Myrelle would be better than
confronting her here, if Siuan&rsquo;s patched-together clues really
pointed at anything, and on a ride she could ask Bryne her
questions, but neither fueled her haste. She had just spotted
Lelaine striding toward her through the tent-rows, Takima at her
side. With one exception, all the women who had been Sitters before
Siuan was deposed had drifted to either Lelaine or Romanda. Most of
the newly chosen Sitters went their own way, which was slightly
better in Egwene&rsquo;s view. Just slightly.</p>

<p>Even at a little distance the set of Lelaine&rsquo;s
shoulders was evident. She looked ready to walk through whatever
got in her way. Siuan saw her as well and darted off without
pausing for so much as a curtsy, yet there was no time to make a
clean escape short of leaping onto Lord Bryne&rsquo;s horse.</p>

<p>Lelaine planted herself in front of Egwene, but it
was Bryne she fixed with eyes sharp as tacks, considering,
calculating what he was doing there. She had larger fish to put on
the fire, though. &ldquo;I must speak with the Amyrlin,&rdquo; she said
peremptorily, pointing toward Myrelle. &ldquo;You will wait; I will talk
to you after.&rdquo; Bryne bowed, not too deeply, and led his horse where
she pointed. Men who had any brains at all soon learned arguments
did little good with Aes Sedai, and with Sitters the tally was
usually none.</p>

<p>Before Lelaine could open her mouth, Romanda was
suddenly there, radiating command so strongly that at first
Egwene did not even notice Varilin with her, and the slender,
red-haired Sitter for the Gray was inches taller than most men. The
only surprise was that Romanda had not appeared sooner. She and
Lelaine watched one another like hawks, neither allowing the other
near Egwene alone. The glow of <em>saidar</em> surrounded both
women at the same instant, and each wove a ward around the five of
them to stop eavesdropping. Their eyes clashed, challenging in
faces utterly cool and collected, but neither let her ward
drop.</p>

<p>Egwene bit her tongue. In a public place, it was up
to the strongest sister present to decide whether a conversation
should be warded, and protocol said the Amyrlin made that decision
wherever she was present. She had no desire for the not-quite
apologies mentioning it would bring, though. If she pressed, they
would accede, of course. While behaving as though soothing a
petulant toddler. She bit her tongue, and boiled inside. Where <em>was</em>
Siuan? That was not fair&mdash;getting horses saddled required
more than moments&mdash;but she wanted to grip her skirts to keep
her hands away from her head.</p>

<p>Romanda dropped the staring match first, though not
in defeat. She rounded on Egwene so suddenly that Lelaine was left
staring past her and looking foolish. &ldquo;Delana is making trouble
again.&rdquo; Her high-pitched voice was almost sweet, but it held a
sharpness that emphasized the lack of any title of respect.
Romanda&rsquo;s hair was completely gray, gathered in a neat bun on
the nape of her neck, but age had certainly not softened her.
Takima, with her long black hair and aged ivory complexion, had
been almost nine years a Brown Sitter, as forceful in the Hall as
in the classroom, yet she stood a meek pace back, hands folded at
her waist. Romanda led her faction as firmly as Sorilea. She was
one to whom strength was indeed all-important, and in truth,
Lelaine seemed not far behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She plans to lay a proposal before the Hall,&rdquo;
Lelaine put in sourly, refusing to look at Romanda at all, now.
Agreeing with the other woman certainly pleased her as little as
speaking second. Aware that she had gained an edge, Romanda smiled,
a faint curving of her lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About what?&rdquo; Egwene asked, playing for time. She was
certain she knew. It was very hard not to sigh. It was very hard
not to rub her temples.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why the Black Ajah, of course, Mother,&rdquo; Varilin
replied, lifting her head as if surprised at the question. Well she
might be; Delana was rabid on the subject. &ldquo;She wants the Hall to
condemn Elaida openly as Black.&rdquo; She stopped abruptly when Lelaine
raised a hand. Lelaine allowed her followers more leeway than
Romanda, or maybe she just did not have as tight a grip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must speak with her, Mother.&rdquo; Lelaine had a warm
smile when she chose to use it. Siuan said they had been friends
once&mdash;Lelaine had accepted her back with some version of
welcome&mdash;yet Egwene thought that smile a practiced tool.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And say what?&rdquo; Her hands ached to soothe her head.
These two each made sure the Hall passed only what she wanted,
certainly little that Egwene suggested, with the result that
nothing much at all was passed, and they wanted <em>her</em> to
intercede with a Sitter? Delana did support her proposals, true&mdash;when they suited her. Delana was a weather-vane, turning
with the last breath of air to pass, and if she turned in
Egwene&rsquo;s direction a great deal of late, it did not mean very
much. The Black Ajah seemed her only fixed point. What was keeping
Siuan?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell her she must stop, Mother.&rdquo; Lelaine&rsquo;s
smile and tone made her seem to be counseling a daughter. &ldquo;This
foolishness&mdash;worse than foolishness&mdash;has everyone at
daggers&rsquo; points. Some of the sisters are even beginning to
believe, Mother. It will not be long before the notion spreads to
the servants, and the soldiers.&rdquo; The look she directed toward Bryne
was full of doubt. Bryne appeared to be attempting to chat with
Myrelle, who was staring at the warded group and running her reins
uneasily through her gloved hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Believing what is plain is hardly foolish,&rdquo; Romanda
barked. &ldquo;Mother&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; In her mouth, that sounded entirely too much
like &ldquo;girl.&rdquo; &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the reason Delana must be stopped is she does
no good and considerable harm. Perhaps Elaida is Black&mdash;though I have strong doubts, whatever secondhand gossip that
trollop Halima brought; Elaida is wrongheaded to a fault, but I
cannot believe her evil&mdash;yet even if she is, trumpeting it
will make outsiders suspicious of every Aes Sedai and drive the
Black into deeper hiding. There are methods to dig them out, if we
don&rsquo;t frighten them into flight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lelaine&rsquo;s sniff bordered on a snort. &ldquo;Even were
this nonsense true, no self-respecting sister would submit to your
<em>methods</em>, Romanda. What you&rsquo;ve suggested is close to
being put to the question.&rdquo; Egwene blinked in confusion; neither
Siuan nor Leane had brought her a whisper of this. Luckily, the
Sitters were not paying her enough mind to notice. As usual.</p>

<p>Planting her fists on her hips, Romanda squared
around on Lelaine. &ldquo;Desperate days demand desperate actions. Some
might ask why anyone would put her dignity ahead of exposing the
Dark One&rsquo;s servants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That sounds dangerously near an accusation,&rdquo; Lelaine
said, eyes narrowing.</p>

<p>Romanda was the one smiling now, a cold flinty smile. &ldquo;I will be the first to submit to my <em>methods</em>, Lelaine, if
you are the second.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lelaine actually growled, taking half a step toward
the other woman, and Romanda leaned toward her, chin thrust out.
They looked ready to begin pulling hair and rolling in the dirt,
and Aes Sedai dignity be hanged. Varilin and Takima glared at one
another like two maidservants supporting their mistresses, a
long-legged wading bird in a scowling match with a wren. The whole
lot of them seemed to have forgotten Egwene entirely.</p>

<p>Siuan came running up in a broad straw hat, leading a
fat dun mare with white-stockinged hind legs, and skidded to a halt
when she saw the warded gathering. One of the grooms was with her,
a lanky fellow in a long, frayed vest and a patched shirt, holding
the reins of a tall roan. The wards were invisible to him, but <em>saidar</em> did not hide the faces. His eyes went very wide, and he
began licking his lips. For that matter, passersby walked wide
around the tent and pretended to see nothing, Aes Sedai, Warders
and servants alike. Bryne alone frowned and studied them as though
wondering what was hidden from his ears. Myrelle was retying her
saddlebags, plainly on the point of leaving.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you have decided what I should say,&rdquo; Egwene
announced, &ldquo;then I can decide what to do.&rdquo; They really had
forgotten her. All four stared at her in amazement as she walked
between Romanda and Lelaine and out through the doubled wards.
There was nothing to feel as she brushed by the weave, of course;
they had never been made to stop anything as solid as a human
body.</p>

<p>When she scrambled onto the roan, Myrelle drew a deep
breath and emulated her in resignation. The wards had vanished,
though the glow still enveloped the two Sitters, each more the
image of frustration than the other as they stood watching.
Hurriedly Egwene donned the thin linen dust-cloak that had been
draped in front of her gelding&rsquo;s saddle, and the riding gloves
that were tucked into a small pocket in the cloak. A wide-brimmed
hat hung from the saddle&rsquo;s high pommel, deep blue to match her
dress, with a spray of white plumes pinned slanting across the
front that shouted of Chesa&rsquo;s hand. Heat she could ignore, but
the glare of the sun was another matter. Removing plumes and pin,
she tucked them into the saddlebags, put the hat on her head and
tied the ribbons beneath her chin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we go, Mother?&rdquo; Bryne asked. He was already
mounted, the helmet that had been hanging from his saddle now
obscuring his face behind steel bars. It looked quite natural on
him, as though he had been born for armor.</p>

<p>She nodded. There was no attempt to stop them.
Lelaine would not stoop to shouting halt in public, of course, but
Romanda&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Egwene felt a sense of relief as they rode away, yet
her head seemed to be splitting. What <em>was</em> she to do about
Delana? What could she do?</p>

<p>The main road in this area, a wide stretch of dirt
packed so hard nothing could raise dust from it, ran through the
army&rsquo;s camp and along the gap between that and the Aes
Sedai&rsquo;s. Bryne angled across it, through the rest of the army
on the other side.</p>

<p>Although the army camp held thirty times or more as
many people as the Aes Sedai camp, there seemed to be few more
tents than for the sisters and those who served them, all scattered
out across the flats and up the hillsides. Most of the soldiers
slept in the open. But then, it was hard to remember the last time
rain had fallen, and there certainly was not a cloud to be seen.
Strangely, there were more women than in the sisters&rsquo; camp,
though they seemed fewer at first glance, among so many men. Cooks
tended kettles and laundresses attacked great heaps of clothing,
while some worked with the horses or wagons. A fair number appeared
to be wives; at least, they sat about knitting or darning dresses
or shirts or stirring small cookpots. Armorers had set up almost
anywhere she looked, hammers making steel ring on their anvils, and
fletchers adding arrows to bundles by their feet, and farriers
checking horses. Wagons of every sort and size stood everywhere,
hundreds, perhaps thousands; the army seemed to scoop up every one
it found along its path. Most of the foragers were already out, but
a few high-wheeled carts and lumbering wagons still trundled away
in search of farms and villages. Here and there soldiers raised a
cheer as they rode by. &ldquo;Lord Bryne!&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Bull! The Bull!&rdquo; That
was his sigil. Nothing about Aes Sedai or the Amyrlin Seat.</p>

<p>Egwene twisted around in her saddle to make sure
Myrelle was still close behind. She was, letting her horse follow
on its own, a far-off, slightly sickly expression on her face.
Siuan had taken a position at the rear, shepherd to their lone
sheep. Then again, she might just have been afraid to urge her
mount ahead. The dun was positively a butterball, but Siuan would
probably treat a pony like a warhorse.</p>

<p>Egwene felt a stab of irritation at her own animal.
His name was Daishar; Glory, in the Old Tongue. She would much
rather be riding Bela, a shaggy little mare not much slimmer than
Siuan&rsquo;s dun that she had ridden out of the Two Rivers.
Sometimes she thought she must look a doll, perched atop a gelding
that could be taken for a warhorse, but the Amyrlin had to have a
proper mount. No shaggy cart horses. Even if this rule was of her
own making, she felt as confined as a novice.</p>

<p>Turning in the saddle, she said, &ldquo;Do you expect any
opposition ahead, Lord Bryne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He glanced at her sideways. She had asked the same
once before leaving Salidar and twice while crossing Altara. Not
enough to rouse suspicions, she thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Murandy is like Altara, Mother. Neighbor too busy
scheming against neighbor, or outright fighting him, to band
together for anything short of a war, and not to any great degree
then.&rdquo; His tone was very dry. He had been Captain-General of the
Queen&rsquo;s Guards in Andor, with years of border skirmishes
against the Murandians behind him. &ldquo;Andor will be another matter, I
fear. I am not looking forward to that.&rdquo; He turned another way,
climbing a gentle slope to avoid three wagons rumbling over rocks
in the same direction.</p>

<p>Egwene tried not to grimace. Andor. Before, he had
just said no. These were the tail end of the Cumbar Hills, somewhat
south of Lugard, the capital of Murandy. Even if they were lucky,
the border of Andor lay at least ten days ahead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when we reach Tar Valon, Lord Bryne. How do you
plan to take the city?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one has asked me that yet, Mother.&rdquo; She had only
thought his voice was dry before; <em>now</em> it was dry. &ldquo;By the
time we reach Tar Valon, the Light willing, I&rsquo;ll have two or
three times as many men as I do now.&rdquo; Egwene winced at the idea of
paying so many soldiers; he did not seem to notice. &ldquo;With that, I
will lay siege. The hardest part will be finding ships, and sinking
them to block Northharbor and Southharbor. The harbors are as much
the key as holding the bridge towns, Mother. Tar Valon is larger
than Cairhien and Caemlyn together. Once food stops going in&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He shrugged. &ldquo;Most of soldiering is waiting, when it isn&rsquo;t
marching.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if you don&rsquo;t have that many soldiers?&rdquo; She
had never thought of all those people going hungry, women and
children. She had never really thought of anyone being involved
except the Aes Sedai, and the soldiers. How could she have been so
foolish? She had seen the results of war in Cairhien. Bryne seemed
to take it so lightly. But then, he was a soldier; privation and
death must be everyday to soldiers. &ldquo;What if you only have&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;say&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;what you do now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Siege?&rdquo; Apparently some of what they had been saying
had finally broken into whatever Myrelle was thinking. She booted
the sorrel forward, making a number of men jump aside, some falling
on their faces. A few opened their mouths angrily, then saw her
ageless features and shut their jaws again, glowering. They might
as well not have existed for all of her. &ldquo;Artur Hawkwing besieged
Tar Valon for twenty years and failed.&rdquo; Abruptly she realized ears
were about and lowered her voice, but it was still acid. &ldquo;Do you
expect us to wait twenty years?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That acid washed over Gareth Bryne without leaving a
stain. &ldquo;Would you prefer a direct assault right off, Myrelle
Sedai?&rdquo; He could have been asking whether she wanted her tea sweet
or bitter. &ldquo;Several of Hawkwing&rsquo;s generals tried, and their
men were slaughtered. No army has ever managed to breach Tar
Valon&rsquo;s walls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was not strictly true, Egwene knew. In the
Trolloc Wars, an army of Dreadlord-led Trollocs had actually
plundered and burned a part of the White Tower itself. At the end
of the War of the Second Dragon, an army trying to rescue Guaire
Amalasan before he was gentled had reached the Tower, too. Myrelle
could not know, though, much less Bryne. Access to those secret
histories, hidden deep in the Tower library, was set out in a law
that was itself secret, and revealing the existence of either
records or law was treason. Siuan said if you read between the
lines, you found hints of things that had not been recorded even
there. Aes Sedai were very good at hiding truth when they thought
it necessary, even from themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With a hundred thousand or what I have now,&rdquo; Bryne
continued, &ldquo;I will be the first. If I can block the harbors.
Hawkwing&rsquo;s generals never managed that. The Aes Sedai always
raised those iron chains in time to stop the ships getting into the
harbor mouth and sank them before they could be placed to hinder
trade. Food and supplies got in. It will come to your assault
eventually, but not until the city&rsquo;s weakened, if I have my
way.&rdquo; His voice was still&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ordinary. A man discussing an
outing. His head turned toward Myrelle, and though his tone did not
change, the intensity in his eyes was evident even behind his
faceguard. &ldquo;And you all agreed I would, when it came to the army. I
won&rsquo;t throw men away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Myrelle opened her mouth, then closed it slowly.
Plainly she wanted to say something but did not know what. They
<em>had</em> given their word, she and Sheriam and those who had
been running things when he appeared in Salidar, however much
giving it galled. However much the Sitters tried to get round it.
<em>They</em> had given no word. Bryne acted as though they had,
though, and so far he had managed to get away with it. So far.</p>

<p>Egwene felt ill. She <em>had</em> seen war. Images
flashed in her head, men fighting, killing their way through the
streets of Tar Valon, dying. Her eyes fell on a square-jawed fellow
chewing his tongue while he sharpened a pikehead. Would he die in
those streets? The grizzled, balding man running his fingers so
carefully down each arrow before sliding the shaft into his quiver?
And there. That lad swaggering in his high riding boots. He looked
too young to shave. Light, so many were boys. How many would die?
For her. For justice, for the right, for the world, but at the
heart, for her. Siuan raised her hand, but did not complete the
gesture. Had she been close enough, she could not pat the Amyrlin
Seat on the shoulder where everyone could see.</p>

<p>Egwene straightened her back. &ldquo;Lord Bryne,&rdquo; she said
in a tight voice, &ldquo;what is it you want me to see?&rdquo; She thought he
half-glanced at Myrelle before answering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better you see it for yourself, Mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene thought her head might break open. If
Siuan&rsquo;s clues led to anything at all, she might just skin
Myrelle. If they did not, she might skin Siuan. And she might throw
Gareth Bryne in for good measure.</p>
