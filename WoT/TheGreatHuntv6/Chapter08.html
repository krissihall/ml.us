<h4><em>The Dragon Reborn</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">R</span>and
walked stiff-legged and nervous at first, beside
the Warder. <em>Face it on your feet</em>. It was easy for Lan to
say. He had not been summoned by the Amyrlin Seat. He was not
wondering if he would be gentled before the day was done, or worse.
Rand felt as if he had something caught in his throat; he could not
swallow, and he wanted to, badly.</p>

<p>The corridors bustled with people, servants going
about their morning chores, warriors wearing swords over lounging
robes. A few young boys carrying small practice swords stayed near
their elders, imitating the way they walked. No sign remained of
the fighting, but an air of alertness clung even to the children.
Grown men looked like cats waiting for a pack of rats.</p>

<p>Ingtar gave Rand and Lan a peculiar look, almost
troubled, opening his mouth, then saying nothing as they passed
him. Kajin, tall and lean and sallow, pumped his fists over his
head and shouted, &ldquo;<em>Tai&rsquo;shar Malkier! Tai&rsquo;shar Manetheren</em>!&rdquo;
True blood of Malkier. True blood of Manetheren.</p>

<p>Rand jumped. <em>Light, why did he say that? Don&rsquo;t be
a fool</em>, he told himself. <em>They all know about Manetheren
here. They know every old story, if it has fighting in it. Burn me,
I have to take a rein on myself</em>.</p>

<p>Lan raised his fists in reply. &ldquo;<em>Tai&rsquo;shar
Shienar!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>If he made a run for it, could he lose himself in the
crowd long enough to reach his horse? <em>If she sends trackers
after me</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;With every step he grew more tense.</p>

<p>As they approached the women&rsquo;s apartments, Lan
suddenly snapped, &ldquo;Cat Crosses the Courtyard!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Startled, Rand instinctively assumed the walking
stance as he had been taught, back straight but every muscle loose,
as if he hung from a wire at the top of his head. It was a relaxed,
almost arrogant, saunter. Relaxed on the outside; he certainly did
not feel it inside. He had no time to wonder what he was doing.
They rounded the last corridor in step with each other.</p>

<p>The women at the entrance to the women&rsquo;s apartments
looked up calmly as they came closer. Some sat behind slanted
tables, checking large ledgers and sometimes making an entry.
Others were knitting, or working with needle and embroidery hoop.
Ladies in silks kept this watch, as well as women in livery. The
arched doors stood open, unguarded except for the women. No more
was needed. No Shienaran man would enter uninvited, but any
Shienaran man stood ready to defend that door if needed, and he
would be aghast at the need.</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s stomach churned, harsh and acid. <em>They&rsquo;ll
take one look at our swords and turn us away. Well, that&rsquo;s what I
want, isn&rsquo;t it? If they turn us back, maybe I can still get away.
If they don&rsquo;t call the guards down on us</em>. He clung to the
stance Lan had given him as he would have to a floating branch in a
flood; holding it was the only thing that kept him from turning
tail and running.</p>

<p>One of the Lady Amalisa&rsquo;s attendants, Nisura, a
round-faced woman, put aside her embroidery and stood as they came
to a stop. Her eyes flickered across their swords, and her mouth
tightened, but she did not mention them. All the women stopped what
they were doing to watch, silent and intent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Honor to you both,&rdquo; Nisura said, bowing her head
slightly. She glanced at Rand, so quickly he was almost not sure he
had seen it; it reminded him of what Perrin had said. &ldquo;The Amyrlin
Seat awaits you.&rdquo; She motioned, and two other ladies&mdash;not
servants; they were being honored&mdash;stepped forward for
escorts. The women bowed, a hair more than Nisura had, and motioned
them through the archway. They both gave Rand a sidelong glance,
then did not look at him again.</p>

<p><em>Were they looking for all of us, or just me? Why
all of us?</em></p>

<p>Inside, they got the looks Rand expected&mdash;two
men in the women&rsquo;s apartments where men were rare&mdash;and their
swords caused more than one raised eyebrow, but none of the women
spoke. The two men left knots of conversation in their path, soft
murmurs too low for Rand to make out. Lan strode along as if he did
not even notice. Rand kept pace behind their escorts and wished he
could hear.</p>

<p>And then they reached the Amyrlin Seat&rsquo;s chambers,
with three Aes Sedai in the hall outside the door. The tall Aes
Sedai, Leane, held her golden-flamed staff. Rand did not know the
other two, one of the White Ajah and one Yellow by their fringe. He
remembered their faces, though, staring at him as he had run
through these same halls. Smooth Aes Sedai faces, with knowing
eyes. They studied him with arched eyebrows and pursed lips. The
women who had brought Lan and Rand curtsied, handing them over to
the Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>Leane looked Rand over with a slight smile. Despite
the smile, her voice had a snap to it. &ldquo;What have you brought the
Amyrlin Seat today, Lan Gaidin? A young lion? Better you don&rsquo;t let
any Greens see this one, or one of them will bond him before he can
take a breath. Greens like to bond them young.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand wondered if it was really possible to sweat
inside your skin. He felt as if he was. He wanted to look at Lan,
but he remembered this part of the Warder&rsquo;s instructions. &ldquo;I am
Rand al&rsquo;Thor, son of Tam al&rsquo;Thor, of the Two Rivers, which once was
Manetheren. As I have been summoned by the Amyrlin Seat, Leane
Sedai, so do I come. I stand ready.&rdquo; He was surprised that his
voice did not shake once.</p>

<p>Leane blinked, and her smile faded to a thoughtful
look. &ldquo;This is supposed to be a shepherd, Lan Gaidin? He was not so
sure of himself this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a man, Leane Sedai,&rdquo; Lan said firmly, &ldquo;no
more, and no less. We are what we are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai shook her head. &ldquo;The world grows
stranger every day. I suppose the blacksmith will wear a crown and
speak in High Chant. Wait here.&rdquo; She vanished inside to announce
them.</p>

<p>She was only gone a few moments, but Rand was
uncomfortably aware of the eyes of the remaining Aes Sedai. He
tried to return their gaze levelly, the way Lan had told him to,
and they put their heads together, whispering. <em>What are they
saying? What do they know? Light, are they going to gentle me?
Was that what Lan meant about facing whatever comes?</em></p>

<p>Leane returned, motioning Rand to go in. When Lan
started to follow, she thrust her staff across his chest, stopping
him. &ldquo;Not you, Lan Gaidin. Moiraine Sedai has a task for you. Your
lion cub will be safe enough by himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door swung shut behind Rand, but not before he
heard Lan&rsquo;s voice, fierce and strong, but low for his ear alone.
&ldquo;<em>Tai&rsquo;shar Manetheren!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine sat to one side of the room, and one of the
Brown Aes Sedai he had seen in the dungeon sat to the other, but it
was the woman in the tall chair behind the wide table who held his
eyes. The curtains had been partially drawn over the arrowslits,
but the gaps let in enough light behind her to make her face hard
to see clearly. He still recognized her, though. The Amyrlin
Seat.</p>

<p>Quickly he dropped to one knee, left hand on sword
hilt, right fist pressed to the patterned rug, and bowed his head.
&ldquo;As you have summoned me, Mother, so have I come. I stand ready.&rdquo;
He lifted his head in time to see her eyebrows rise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you now, boy?&rdquo; She sounded almost amused. And
something else he could not make out. She certainly did not look
amused. &ldquo;Stand up, boy, and let me have a look at you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He straightened and tried to keep his face relaxed.
It was an effort not to clench his hands. <em>Three Aes Sedai. How
many does it take to gentle a man? They sent a dozen or more after
Logain. Would Moiraine do that to me?</em> He met the Amyrlin
Seat&rsquo;s look eye to eye. She did not blink.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit, boy,&rdquo; she said finally, gesturing to a
ladder-back chair that had been pulled around squarely in front of
the table. &ldquo;This will not be short, I fear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mother.&rdquo; He bowed his head, then, as Lan
had told him, glanced at the chair and touched his sword. &ldquo;By your
leave, Mother, I will stand. The watch is not done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin Seat made an exasperated sound and looked
at Moiraine. &ldquo;Have you let Lan at him, Daughter? This will be
difficult enough without him picking up Warder ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lan has been teaching all the boys, Mother,&rdquo;
Moiraine replied calmly. &ldquo;He has spent a little more time with this
one than the others because he carries a sword.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Brown Aes Sedai shifted on her chair. &ldquo;The Gaidin
are stiff-necked and proud, Mother, but useful. I would not be
without Tomas, as you would not lose Alric. I have even heard a few
Reds say they sometimes wish for a Warder. And the Greens, of
course&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three Aes Sedai were all ignoring him, now. &ldquo;This
sword,&rdquo; the Amyrlin Seat said. &ldquo;It appears to be a heron-mark
blade. How did he come by that, Moiraine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tam al&rsquo;Thor left the Two Rivers as a boy, Mother. He
joined the army of Illian, and served in the Whitecloak War and the
last two wars with Tear. In time he rose to be a blademaster and
the Second Captain of the Companions. After the Aiel War, Tam
al&rsquo;Thor returned to the Two Rivers with a wife from Caemlyn and an
infant boy. It would have saved much, had I known this earlier, but
I know it now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stared at Moiraine. He knew Tam had left the Two
Rivers and come back with an outlander wife and the sword, but the
rest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Where did you learn all that? Not in Emond&rsquo;s Field.
Unless Nynaeve told you more than she&rsquo;s ever told me. An infant
boy. She doesn&rsquo;t say his son. But I am</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Against Tear.&rdquo; The Amyrlin Seat frowned slightly.
&ldquo;Well, there was blame enough on both sides in those wars. Fool men
who would rather fight than talk. Can you tell if the blade is
authentic, Verin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are tests, Mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then take it and test it, Daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three women were not even looking at him. Rand
stepped back, gripping the hilt hard. &ldquo;My father gave this sword to
me,&rdquo; he said angrily. &ldquo;Nobody is taking it from me.&rdquo; It was only
then that he realized Verin had not moved from her chair. He looked
at them in confusion, trying to recover his equilibrium.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; the Amyrlin Seat said, &ldquo;you have some fire in
you besides whatever Lan put in. Good. You will need it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am what I am, Mother,&rdquo; he managed smoothly enough.
&ldquo;I stand ready for what comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin Seat grimaced. &ldquo;Lan <em>has</em> been at
you. Listen to me, boy. In a few hours, Ingtar will leave to find
the stolen Horn. Your friend, Mat, will go with him. I expect that
your other friend&mdash;Perrin?&mdash;will go, also. Do you wish
to accompany them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat and Perrin are going? Why?&rdquo; Belatedly he
remembered to add a respectful, &ldquo;Mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know of the dagger your friend carried?&rdquo; A twist
of her mouth showed what she thought of the dagger. &ldquo;That was
taken, too. Unless it is found, the link between him and the blade
cannot be broken completely, and he will die. You can ride with
them, if you want. Or you can stay here. No doubt Lord Agelmar will
let you remain as a guest as long as you wish. I will be leaving
today, as well. Moiraine Sedai will accompany me, and so will
Egwene and Nynaeve, so you will stay alone, if you stay. The choice
is yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stared at her. <em>She is saying I can go as I
want. Is that what she brought me here for? Mat is dying!</em> He
glanced at Moiraine, sitting impassively with her hands folded in
her lap. She looked as if nothing in the world could concern her
less than where he went. <em>Which way are you trying to push me,
Aes Sedai? Burn me, but I&rsquo;ll go another. But if Mat&rsquo;s dying</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>I can&rsquo;t abandon him. Light, how are we going to find that
dagger?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not have to make the choice now,&rdquo; the Amyrlin
said. She did not seem to care, either. &ldquo;But you will have to
choose before Ingtar leaves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will ride with Ingtar, Mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin Seat nodded absently. &ldquo;Now that that is
dealt with, we can move on to important matters. I know you can
channel, boy. What do you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s mouth fell open. Caught up in worrying about
Mat, her casual words hit him like a swinging barn door. All of
Lan&rsquo;s advice and instructions went spinning. He stared at her,
licking his lips. It was one thing to think she knew, entirely
another to find out she really did. The sweat finally seeped out on
his forehead.</p>

<p>She leaned forward in her seat, waiting for his
answer, but he had the feeling she wanted to lean back. He
remembered what Lan had said. <em>If she&rsquo;s afraid of you</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He wanted to laugh. If <em>she</em> was afraid of <em>him</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t. I mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t do it on purpose.
It just happened. I don&rsquo;t want to&mdash;to channel the Power. I
won&rsquo;t ever do it again. I swear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; the Amyrlin Seat said. &ldquo;Well,
that&rsquo;s wise of you. And foolish, too. Some can be taught to
channel; most cannot. A few, though, have the seed in them at
birth. Sooner or later, they wield the One Power whether they want
to or not, as surely as roe makes fish. You will continue to
channel, boy. You can&rsquo;t help it. And you had better <em>learn</em>
to channel, learn to control it, or you will not live long enough
to go mad. The One Power kills those who cannot control its
flow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How am I supposed to learn?&rdquo; he demanded. Moiraine
and Verin just sat there, unruffled, watching him. <em>Like
spiders</em>. &ldquo;How? Moiraine claims she can&rsquo;t teach me anything,
and I don&rsquo;t know how to learn, or what. I don&rsquo;t want to, anyway. I
want to stop. Can&rsquo;t you understand that? To stop!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you the truth, Rand,&rdquo; Moiraine said. She
sounded as if they were having a pleasant conversation. &ldquo;Those who
could teach you, the male Aes Sedai, are three thousand years dead.
No Aes Sedai living can teach you to touch <em>saidin</em> any more
than you could learn to touch <em>saidar</em>. A bird cannot teach
a fish to fly, nor a fish teach a bird to swim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have always thought that was a bad saying,&rdquo; Verin
said suddenly. &ldquo;There are birds that dive and swim. And in the Sea
of Storms are fish that fly, with long fins that stretch out as
wide as your outstretched arms, and beaks like swords that can
pierce&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Her words trailed off and she became flustered.
Moiraine and the Amyrlin Seat were staring at her without
expression.</p>

<p>Rand took the interruption to try to regain some
control of himself. As Tam had taught him long ago, he formed a
single flame in his mind and fed his fears into it, seeking
emptiness, the stillness of the void. The flame seemed to grow
until it enveloped everything, until it was too large to contain or
imagine any longer. With that it was gone, leaving in its place a
sense of peace. At its edges, emotions still flickered, fear and
anger like black blotches, but the void held. Thought skimmed
across its surface like pebbles across ice. The Aes Sedai&rsquo;s
attention was only off him for a moment, but when they turned back
his face was calm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you talking to me like this, Mother?&rdquo; he
asked. &ldquo;You should be gentling me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin Seat frowned and turned to Moiraine. &ldquo;Did
Lan teach him this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Mother. He had it from Tam al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Rand demanded again.</p>

<p>The Amyrlin Seat looked him straight in the eye and
said, &ldquo;Because you are the Dragon Reborn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The void rocked. The world rocked. Everything seemed
to spin around him. He concentrated on nothing, and the emptiness
returned, the world steadied. &ldquo;No, Mother. I can channel, the Light
help me, but I am not Raolin Darksbane, nor Guaire Amalasin, nor
Yurian Stonebow. You can gentle me, or kill me, or let me go, but I
will not be a tame false Dragon on a Tar Valon leash.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He heard Verin gasp, and the Amyrlin&rsquo;s eyes widened,
a gaze as hard as blue rock. It did not affect him; it slid off the
void within.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you hear those names?&rdquo; the Amyrlin
demanded. &ldquo;Who told you Tar Valon pulls the lines on any false
Dragon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A friend, Mother,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A gleeman. His name was
Thom Merrilin. He&rsquo;s dead, now.&rdquo; Moiraine made a sound, and he
glanced at her. She claimed Thom was not dead, but she had never
offered any proof, and he could not see how any man could survive
grappling hand-to-hand with a Fade. The thought was extraneous, and
it faded away. There was only the void and the oneness now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not a false Dragon,&rdquo; the Amyrlin said
firmly. &ldquo;You are the true Dragon Reborn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a shepherd from the Two Rivers, Mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Daughter, tell him the story. A <em>true</em> story,
boy. Listen well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine began speaking. Rand kept his eyes on the
Amyrlin&rsquo;s face, but he heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nearly twenty years ago the Aiel crossed the Spine
of the World, the Dragonwall, the only time they have ever done so.
They ravaged through Cairhien, destroyed every army sent against
them, burned the city of Cairhien itself, and fought all the way to
Tar Valon. It was winter and snowing, but cold or heat mean little
to an Aiel. The final battle, the last that counted, was fought
outside the Shining Walls, in the shadow of Dragonmount. In three
days and three nights of fighting, the Aiel were turned back. Or
rather they turned back, for they had done what they came to do,
which was to kill King Laman of Cairhien, for his sin against the
Tree. It is then that my story begins. And yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>They came over the Dragonwall like a flood. All
the way to the Shining Walls</em>. Rand waited for the memories to
fade, but it was Tam&rsquo;s voice he heard, Tam sick and raving, pulling
up secrets from his past. The voice clung outside the void,
clamoring to get in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was one of the Accepted, then,&rdquo; Moiraine said, &ldquo;as
was our Mother, the Amyrlin Seat. We were soon to be raised to
sisterhood, and that night we stood attendance on the then Amyrlin.
Her Keeper of the Chronicles, Gitara Moroso, was there. Every other
full sister in Tar Valon was out Healing as many wounded as she
could find, even the Reds. It was dawn. The fire on the hearth
could not keep the cold out. The snow had finally stopped, and in
the Amyrlin&rsquo;s chambers in the White Tower we could smell the smoke
of outlying villages burned in the fighting.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Battles are always hot, even in the snow. Had to
get away from the stink of death</em>. Tam&rsquo;s delirious voice clawed
at the empty calm inside Rand. The void trembled and shrank,
steadied, then wavered again. The Amyrlin&rsquo;s eyes bored at him. He
felt sweat on his face again. &ldquo;It was all a fever dream,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;He was sick.&rdquo; He raised his voice. &ldquo;My name is Rand al&rsquo;Thor. I am
a shepherd. My father is Tam al&rsquo;Thor, and my mother was&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine had paused for him, but now her unchanging
voice cut him off, soft and relentless. &ldquo;<em>The Karaethon
Cycle</em>, the Prophecies of the Dragon, says that the Dragon will
be reborn on the slopes of Dragonmount, where he died during the
Breaking of the World. Gitara Sedai had the Foretelling sometimes.
She was old, her hair as white as the snow outside, but when she
had the Foretelling, it was strong. The morning light through the
windows was strengthening as I handed her a cup of tea. The Amyrlin
Seat asked me what news there was from the field of battle. And
Gitara Sedai started up out of her chair, her arms and legs rigid,
trembling, her face as if she looked into the Pit of Doom at Shayol
Ghul, and she cried out, &lsquo;He is born again! I feel him! The
Dragon takes his first breath on the slope of Dragonmount! He is
coming! He is coming! Light help us! Light help the world! He lies
in the snow and cries like the thunder! He burns like the
sun!&rsquo; And she fell forward into my arms, dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Slope of the mountain. Heard a baby cry. Gave
birth there alone, before she died. Child blue with the cold</em>.
Rand tried to force Tam&rsquo;s voice away. The void grew smaller. &ldquo;A
fever-dream,&rdquo; he gasped. <em>I couldn&rsquo;t leave a child</em>. &ldquo;I was
born in the Two Rivers.&rdquo; <em>Always knew you wanted children,
Kari</em>. He pulled his eyes away from the Amyrlin&rsquo;s gaze. He
tried to force the void to hold. He knew that was not the way, but
it was collapsing in him. <em>Yes, lass. Rand is a good name</em>.
&ldquo;I&mdash;am&mdash;Rand&mdash;al&rsquo;Thor!&rdquo; His legs trembled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so we knew the Dragon was Reborn,&rdquo; Moiraine went
on. &ldquo;The Amyrlin swore us to secrecy, we two, for she knew not all
the sisters would see the Rebirth as it must be seen. She set us to
searching. There were many fatherless children after that battle.
Too many. But we found a story, that one man had found an infant on
the mountain. That was all. A man and an infant boy. So we searched
on. For years we searched, finding other clues, poring over the
Prophecies. &lsquo;He will be of the ancient blood, and raised by the old
blood.&rsquo; That was one; there were others. But there are many places
where the old blood, descended from the Age of Legends, remains
strong. Then, in the Two Rivers, where the old blood of Manetheren
seethes still like a river in flood, in Emond&rsquo;s Field, I found
three boys whose namedays were within weeks of the battle at
Dragonmount. And one of them can channel. Did you think Trollocs
came after you just because you are <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>? You are the
Dragon Reborn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s knees gave way; he dropped to a squat, hands
slapping the rug to catch himself from falling on his face. The
void was gone, the stillness shattered. He raised his head, and
they were looking at him, the three Aes Sedai. Their faces were
serene, smooth as unruffled ponds, but their eyes did not blink.
&ldquo;My father is Tam al&rsquo;Thor, and I was born&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; They stared at
him, unmoving. <em>They&rsquo;re lying. I am not</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>what they
say! Some way, somehow, they&rsquo;re lying, trying to use me</em>. &ldquo;I
will not be used by you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An anchor is not demeaned by being used to hold a
boat,&rdquo; the Amyrlin said. &ldquo;You were made for a purpose, Rand
al&rsquo;Thor. &lsquo;When the winds of Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don scour the earth, he will
face the Shadow and bring forth Light again in the world.&rsquo; The
Prophecies must be fulfilled, or the Dark One will break free and
remake the world in his image. The Last Battle is coming, and you
were born to unite mankind and lead them against the Dark One.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ba&rsquo;alzamon is dead,&rdquo; Rand said hoarsely, and the
Amyrlin snorted like a stablehand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you believe that, you are as much a fool as the
Domani. Many there believe he is dead, or say they do, but I notice
they still won&rsquo;t risk naming him. The Dark One lives, and he is
breaking free. You will face the Dark One. It is your destiny.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>It is your destiny</em>. He had heard that
before, in a dream that had maybe not been entirely a dream. He
wondered what the Amyrlin would say if she knew Ba&rsquo;alzamon had
spoken to him in dreams. <em>That&rsquo;s done with. Ba&rsquo;alzamon is dead.
I saw him die</em>.</p>

<p>Suddenly it came to him that he was crouching like a
toad, huddling under their eyes. He tried to form the void again,
but voices whirled through his head, sweeping away every effort.
<em>It is your destiny. Babe lying in the snow. You are the Dragon
Reborn. Ba&rsquo;alzamon is dead. Rand is a good name, Kari. I will not
be used!</em> Drawing on his own native stubbornness, he forced
himself back upright. <em>Face it on your feet. You can keep your
pride, at least</em>. The three Aes Sedai watched with no
expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; With an effort he steadied his voice.
&ldquo;What are you going to do to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; the Amyrlin said, and he blinked. It was
not the answer he had expected, the one he had feared. &ldquo;You say you
want to accompany your friend with Ingtar, and you may. I have not
marked you out in any way. Some of the sisters may know you are
<em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, but no more. Only we three know who you truly
are. Your friend Perrin will be brought to me, as you were, and I
will visit your other friend in the infirmary. You may go as you
will, without fear that we will set the Red sisters on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Who you truly are</em>. Anger flared up in him,
hot and corrosive. He forced it to stay inside, hidden. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Prophecies must be fulfilled. We let you walk
free, knowing what you are, because otherwise the world we know
will die, and the Dark One will cover the earth with fire and
death. Mark me, not all Aes Sedai feel the same. There are some
here in Fal Dara who would strike you down if they knew a tenth of
what you are, and feel no more remorse than for gutting a fish. But
then, there are men who&rsquo;ve no doubt laughed with you who would do
the same, if they knew. Have a care, Rand al&rsquo;Thor, Dragon
Reborn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at each of them in turn. <em>Your
Prophecies are no part of me</em>. They returned his gaze so calmly
it was hard to believe they were trying to convince him he was the
most hated, the most feared man in the history of the world. He had
gone right through fear and come out the other side in some place
cold. Anger was all that kept him warm. They could gentle him, or
burn him to a crisp where he stood, and he no longer cared.</p>

<p>A part of Lan&rsquo;s instructions came back to him. Left
hand on the hilt, he twisted the sword behind him, catching the
scabbard in his right, then bowed, arms straight. &ldquo;By your leave,
Mother, may I depart this place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I give you leave to go, my son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Straightening, he stood there a moment longer. &ldquo;I
will not be used,&rdquo; he told them. There was a long silence as he
turned and left.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The silence stretched on in the room after Rand left
until it was broken by a long breath from the Amyrlin. &ldquo;I cannot
make myself like what we just did,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was necessary,
but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Did it work, Daughters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine shook her head, just the slightest movement.
&ldquo;I do not know. But it <em>was</em> necessary, and is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Necessary,&rdquo; Verin agreed. She touched her forehead,
then peered at the dampness on her fingers. &ldquo;He is strong. And as
stubborn as you said, Moiraine. Much stronger than I expected. We
may have to gentle him after all before&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Her eyes widened.
&ldquo;But we cannot, can we? The Prophecies. The Light forgive us for
what we are loosing on the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Prophecies,&rdquo; Moiraine said, nodding.
&ldquo;Afterwards, we will do as we must. As we do now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As we must,&rdquo; the Amyrlin said. &ldquo;Yes. But when he
learns to channel, the Light help us all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The silence returned.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">There was a storm coming. Nynaeve felt it. A big
storm, worse than she had ever seen. She could listen to the wind,
and hear what the weather would be. All Wisdoms claimed to be able
to do that, though many could not. Nynaeve had felt more
comfortable with the ability before learning it was a manifestation
of the Power. Any woman who could listen to the wind could channel,
though most were probably as she had been, unaware of what she was
doing, getting it only in fits and starts.</p>

<p>This time, though, something was wrong. Outside, the
morning sun was a golden ball in a clear blue sky, and birds sang
in the gardens, but that was not it. There would have been nothing
to listening to the wind if she could not foretell the weather
before the signs were visible. There was something wrong with the
feeling this time, something not quite the way it usually was. The
storm felt distant, too far off for her to feel at all. Yet it felt
as if the sky above should have been pouring down rain, and snow,
and hail, all at the same time, with winds howling to shake the
stones of the keep. And she could feel the good weather, too,
lasting for days yet, but that was muted under the other.</p>

<p>A bluefinch perched in an arrowslit like a mockery of
her weather sense, peering into the hallway. When it saw her, it
vanished in a flash of blue and white feathers.</p>

<p>She stared at the spot where the bird had been.
<em>There is a storm, and there isn&rsquo;t. It means something. But
what?</em></p>

<p>Far down the hall full of women and small children
she saw Rand striding away, his escort of women half running to
keep up. Nynaeve nodded firmly. If there was a storm that was not a
storm, he would be the center of it. Gathering her skirts, she
hurried after him.</p>

<p>Women with whom she had grown friendly since coming
to Fal Dara tried to speak to her; they knew Rand had come with her
and that they were both from the Two Rivers, and they wanted to
know why the Amyrlin had summoned him. <em>The Amyrlin Seat!</em>
Ice in the pit of her belly, she broke into a run, but before she
left the women&rsquo;s apartments, she had lost him around too many
corners and beyond too many people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which way did he go?&rdquo; she asked Nisura. There was no
need to say who. She heard Rand&rsquo;s name in the conversation of the
other women clustered around the arched doors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Nynaeve. He came out as fast as if he
had Heartsbane himself at his heels. As well he might, coming here
with a sword at his belt. The Dark One should be the least of his
worries after that. What is the world coming to? And him presented
to the Amyrlin in her chambers, no less. Tell me, Nynaeve, is he
really a prince in your land?&rdquo; The other women stopped talking and
leaned closer to listen.</p>

<p>Nynaeve was not sure what she answered. Something
that made them let her go on. She hurried away from the women&rsquo;s
apartments, head swiveling at every crossing corridor to look for
him, fists clenched. <em>Light, what have they done to him? I
should have gotten him away from Moiraine somehow, the Light blind
her. I&rsquo;m his Wisdom</em>.</p>

<p><em>Are you</em>, a small voice taunted. <em>You&rsquo;ve
abandoned Emond&rsquo;s Field to fend for itself. Can you still call
yourself their Wisdom?</em></p>

<p><em>I did not abandon them</em>, she told herself
fiercely. <em>I brought Mavra Mallen up from Deven Ride to look
after matters till I get back. She can deal well enough with the
Mayor and the Village Council, and she gets on well with the
Women&rsquo;s Circle</em>.</p>

<p><em>Mavra will have to get back to her own village.
No village can do without its Wisdom for long</em>. Nynaeve cringed
inside. She had been gone months from Emond&rsquo;s Field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the Wisdom of Emond&rsquo;s Field!&rdquo; she said
aloud.</p>

<p>A liveried servant carrying a bolt of cloth blinked
at her, then bowed low before scurrying off. By his face he was
eager to be anywhere else.</p>

<p>Blushing, Nynaeve looked around to see if anyone had
noticed. There were only a few men in the hall, engrossed in their
own conversations, and some women in black-and-gold going about
their business, giving her a bow or curtsy as she passed. She had
had that argument with herself a hundred times before, but this was
the first time it had come to talking to herself out loud. She
muttered under her breath, then pressed her lips firmly together
when she realized what she was doing.</p>

<p>She was finally beginning to realize her search was
futile when she came on Lan, his back to her, looking down on the
outer courtyard through an arrowslit. The noise from the courtyard
was all horses and men, neighing and shouting. So intent was Lan
that he did not, for once, seem to hear her. She hated the fact
that she could never sneak up on him, however softly she stepped.
She had been accounted good at woodscraft back in Emond&rsquo;s Field,
though it was not a skill in which many women took any
interest.</p>

<p>She stopped in her tracks, pressing her hands to her
stomach to quiet a flutter. <em>I ought to dose myself with rannel
and sheepstongue root</em>, she thought sourly. It was the mixture
she gave anyone who moped about and claimed they were sick, or
behaved like a goose. Rannel and sheepstongue root would perk you
up a little, and did no harm, but mainly it tasted horrible, and
the taste lasted all day. It was a perfect cure for acting the
fool.</p>

<p>Safe from his eyes, she studied the length of him,
leaning against the stone and fingering his chin as he studied what
was going on below. <em>He&rsquo;s too tall, for one thing, and old
enough to be my father, for another. A man with a face like that
would have to be cruel. No, he&rsquo;s not that. Never that</em>. And he
was a king. His land was destroyed while he was a child, and he
would not claim a crown, but he was a king, for that. <em>What
would a king want with a village woman? He&rsquo;s a Warder, too. Bonded
to Moiraine. She has his loyalty to death, and ties closer than any
lover, and she has him. She has everything I want, the Light burn
her!</em></p>

<p>He turned from the arrowslit, and she whirled to
go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve.&rdquo; His voice caught and held her like a
noose. &ldquo;I wanted to speak to you alone. You always seem to be in
the women&rsquo;s apartments, or in company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It took an effort to face him, but she was sure her
features were calm when she looked up at him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for
Rand.&rdquo; She was not about to admit to avoiding him. &ldquo;We said all we
need to say long ago, you and I. I shamed myself&mdash;which I
will not do again&mdash;and you told me to go away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never said&mdash;&rdquo; He took a deep breath. &ldquo;I told
you I had nothing to offer for brideprice but widow&rsquo;s clothes. Not
a gift any man could give a woman. Not a man who can call himself a
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; she said coolly. &ldquo;In any case, a king
does not give gifts to village women. And this village woman would
not take them. Have you seen Rand? I need to talk to him. He was to
see the Amyrlin. Do you know what she wanted with him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His eyes blazed like blue ice in the sun. She
stiffened her legs to keep from stepping back, and met him glare
for glare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Dark One take Rand al&rsquo;Thor and the Amyrlin Seat
both,&rdquo; he grated, pressing something into her hand. &ldquo;I will make
you a gift and you will take it if I have to chain it around your
neck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She pulled her eyes away from his. He had a stare
like a blue-eyed hawk when he was angry. In her hand was a signet
ring, heavy gold and worn with age, almost large enough for both
her thumbs to fit through. On it, a crane flew above a lance and
crown, all carefully wrought in detail. Her breath caught. The ring
of Malkieri kings. Forgetting to glare, she lifted her face. &ldquo;I
cannot take this, Lan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shrugged in an offhand way. &ldquo;It is nothing. Old,
and useless, now. But there are those who would know it when they
saw it. Show that, and you will have guestright, and help if you
need it, from any lord in the Borderlands. Show it to a Warder, and
he will give aid, or carry a message to me. Send it to me, or a
message marked with it, and I will come to you, without delay and
without fail. This I swear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her vision blurred at the edges. <em>If I cry now, I
will kill myself</em>. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I do not want a gift from
you, al&rsquo;Lan Mandragoran. Here, take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He fended off her attempts to give the ring back to
him. His hand enveloped hers, gentle but firm as a shackle. &ldquo;Then
take it for my sake, as a favor to me. Or throw it away, if it
displeases you. I&rsquo;ve no better use for it.&rdquo; He brushed her cheek
with a finger, and she gave a start. &ldquo;I must go now, Nynaeve
<em>mashiara</em>. The Amyrlin wishes to leave before midday, and
there is much yet to be done. Perhaps we will have time to talk on
the journey to Tar Valon.&rdquo; He turned and was gone, striding down
the hall.</p>

<p>Nynaeve touched her cheek. She could still feel where
he had touched her. <em>Mashiara</em>. Beloved of heart and soul,
it meant, but a love lost, too. Lost beyond regaining. <em>Fool
woman! Stop acting like a girl with her hair still not braided.
It&rsquo;s no use letting him make you feel</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Clutching the ring tightly, she turned around, and
jumped when she found herself face-to-face with Moiraine. &ldquo;How long
have you been there?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not long enough to hear anything I should not have,&rdquo;
the Aes Sedai replied smoothly. &ldquo;We <em>will</em> be leaving soon.
I heard that. You must see to your packing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leaving. It had not penetrated when Lan said it. &ldquo;I
will have to say goodbye to the boys,&rdquo; she muttered, then gave
Moiraine a sharp look. &ldquo;What have you done to Rand? He was taken to
the Amyrlin. Why? Did you tell her about&mdash;about&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; She
could not say it. He was from her own village, and she was just
enough older than he to have looked after him a time or two when he
was little, but she could not even think about what he had become
without her stomach twisting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Amyrlin will be seeing all three, Nynaeve.
<em>Ta&rsquo;veren</em> are not so common that she would miss the chance
to see three together in one place. Perhaps she will give them a
few words of encouragement, since they are riding with Ingtar to
hunt those who stole the Horn. They will be leaving about the time
we do, so you had better hurry with any farewells.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve dashed to the nearest arrowslit and peered
down at the outer courtyard. Horses were everywhere, pack animals
and saddle horses, and men hurrying about them, calling to each
other. The only clear space was where the Amyrlin&rsquo;s palanquin
stood, its paired horses waiting patiently without any attendants.
Some of the Warders were out there, looking over their mounts, and
on the other side of the courtyard, Ingtar stood with a knot of
Shienarans around him in armor. Sometimes a Warder or one of
Ingtar&rsquo;s men crossed the paving stones to exchange a word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have gotten the boys away from you,&rdquo; she
said, still looking out. <em>Egwene, too, if I could do it without
killing her. Light, why did she have to be born with this cursed
ability?</em> &ldquo;I should have taken them back home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are more than old enough to be off apron
strings,&rdquo; Moiraine said dryly. &ldquo;And you know very well why you
could never do that. For one of them, at least. Besides, it would
mean leaving Egwene to go to Tar Valon alone. Or have you decided
to forgo Tar Valon yourself? If your own use of the Power is not
schooled, you will never be able to use it against me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve spun to face the Aes Sedai, her jaw dropping.
She could not help it. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you are talking
about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you think I did not know, child? Well, as you
wish it. I take it that you <em>are</em> coming to Tar Valon? Yes,
I thought so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve wanted to hit her, to knock away the brief
smile that flashed across the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s face. Aes Sedai had not
been able to wield power openly since the Breaking, much less the
One Power, but they plotted and manipulated, pulled strings like
puppet-masters, used thrones and nations like stones on a stones
board. <em>She wants to use me, too, somehow. If a king or a queen,
why not a Wisdom? Just the way she&rsquo;s using Rand. I&rsquo;m no child, Aes
Sedai</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing with Rand, now? Have you not used
him enough? I don&rsquo;t know why you have not had him gentled, now the
Amyrlin&rsquo;s here with all those other Aes Sedai, but you must have a
reason. It must be some plot you&rsquo;re hatching. If the Amyrlin knew
what you were up to, I wager she&rsquo;d&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine cut her off. &ldquo;What possible interest could
the Amyrlin have in a shepherd? Of course, if he were brought to
her attention in the wrong way, he might be gentled, or even
killed. He is what he is, after all. And there is considerable
anger about last night. Everyone is looking for whom to blame.&rdquo; The
Aes Sedai fell silent, and let the silence stretch. Nynaeve stared
at her, grinding her teeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Moiraine said finally, &ldquo;much better to let a
sleeping lion sleep. Best you see to your packing, now.&rdquo; She moved
off in the direction Lan had gone, seeming to glide across the
floor.</p>

<p>Grimacing, Nynaeve swung her fist back against the
wall; the ring dug at her palm. She opened her hand to look at it.
The ring seemed to heat her anger, focus her hate. <em>I</em> will
<em>learn. You think because you know, you can escape me. But I
will learn better than you think, and I will pull you down for what
you&rsquo;ve done. For what you&rsquo;ve done to Mat, and to Perrin. For Rand,
the Light help him and the Creator shelter him. Especially for
Rand</em>. Her hand closed around the heavy circlet of gold.
<em>And for me</em>.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Egwene watched the liveried maid folding her dresses
into a leather-covered travel chest, still a little uncomfortable,
even after nearly a month&rsquo;s practice, with someone else doing what
she could very well have done herself. They were such beautiful
dresses, all gifts from the Lady Amalisa, just like the gray silk
riding dress she wore, though that was plain except for a few white
morningstar blossoms worked on the breast. Many of the dresses were
much more elaborate. Any one of them would shine at Sunday, or at
Bel Tine. She sighed, remembering that she would be in Tar Valon
for the next Sunday, not Emond&rsquo;s Field. From the little Moiraine
had told her of novice training&mdash;almost nothing, really&mdash;she expected
she might not be home for Bel Tine, in the spring, or even the
Sunday after that.</p>

<p>Nynaeve put her head into the room. &ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo;
She came the rest of the way in. &ldquo;We must be down in the courtyard
soon.&rdquo; She wore a riding dress, too, in blue silk with red
loversknots on the bosom. Another gift from Amalisa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nearly, Nynaeve. I am almost sorry to be going. I
don&rsquo;t suppose we&rsquo;ll have many chances in Tar Valon to wear the nice
dresses Amalisa gave us.&rdquo; She gave an abrupt laugh. &ldquo;Still, Wisdom,
I won&rsquo;t miss being able to bathe without looking over my shoulder
the whole time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much better to bathe alone,&rdquo; Nynaeve said briskly.
Her face did not change, but after a moment her cheeks colored.</p>

<p>Egwene smiled. <em>She&rsquo;s thinking about Lan</em>. It
was still odd to think of Nynaeve, the Wisdom, mooning after a man.
She did not think it would be wise to put it to Nynaeve in quite
that way, but of late, sometimes the Wisdom acted as strangely as
any girl who had set her heart on a particular man. <em>And one who
doesn&rsquo;t have enough sense to be worthy of her, at that. She loves
him, and I can see he loves her, so why can&rsquo;t he have sense enough
to speak up?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you should call me Wisdom any longer,&rdquo;
Nynaeve said suddenly.</p>

<p>Egwene blinked. It was not required, exactly, and
Nynaeve never insisted on it unless she was angry, or being formal,
but this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;Why ever not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a woman, now.&rdquo; Nynaeve glanced at her
unbraided hair, and Egwene resisted the urge to hurriedly twist it
into a semblance of a braid. Aes Sedai wore their hair any way they
wanted, but wearing hers loose had become a symbol of starting on a
new life. &ldquo;You are a woman,&rdquo; Nynaeve repeated firmly. &ldquo;We are two
women, a long way from Emond&rsquo;s Field, and it will be longer still
before we see home again. It will be better if you simply call me
Nynaeve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will see home again, Nynaeve. We will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to comfort the Wisdom, girl,&rdquo; Nynaeve said
gruffly, but she smiled.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door, but before Egwene
could open it, Nisura came in, agitation all over her face.
&ldquo;Egwene, that young man of yours is trying to come into the women&rsquo;s
apartments.&rdquo; She sounded scandalized. &ldquo;And wearing a sword. Just
because the Amyrlin let him enter that way&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Lord Rand should
know better. He is causing an uproar. Egwene, you must speak to
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord Rand,&rdquo; Nynaeve snorted. &ldquo;That young man is
growing too big for his breeches. When I get my hands on him, I&rsquo;ll
lord him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene put a hand on Nynaeve&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Let me speak to
him, Nynaeve. Alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well. The best of men are not much better
than housebroken.&rdquo; Nynaeve paused, and added half to herself, &ldquo;But
then, the best of them are worth the trouble of housebreaking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene shook her head as she followed Nisura into the
hall. Even half a year before, Nynaeve would never have added the
second part. <em>But she&rsquo;ll never housebreak Lan</em>. Her thoughts
turned to Rand. Causing an uproar, was he? &ldquo;Housebreak him?&rdquo; she
muttered. &ldquo;If he hasn&rsquo;t learned manners by this time, I&rsquo;ll skin him
alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes that is what it takes,&rdquo; Nisura said,
walking quickly. &ldquo;Men are never more than half-civilized until
they&rsquo;re wedded.&rdquo; She gave Egwene a sidelong glance. &ldquo;Do you intend
to marry Lord Rand? I do not mean to pry, but you are going to the
White Tower, and Aes Sedai seldom wed&mdash;none but some of the
Green Ajah, that I&rsquo;ve ever heard, and not many of them&mdash;and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene could supply the rest. She had heard the talk
in the women&rsquo;s apartments about a suitable wife for Rand. At first
it had caused stabs of jealousy, and anger. He had been all but
promised to her since they were children. But she was going to be
an Aes Sedai, and he was what he was. A man who could channel. She
could marry him. And watch him go mad, watch him die. The only way
to stop it would be to have him gentled. <em>I can&rsquo;t do that to
him. I can&rsquo;t!</em> &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; she said sadly.</p>

<p>Nisura nodded. &ldquo;No one will poach where you have a
claim, but you are going to the Tower, and he will make a good
husband. Once he has been trained. There he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The women gathered around the entrance to the women&rsquo;s
apartments, both inside and out, were all watching three men in the
hallway outside. Rand, with his sword buckled over his red coat,
was being confronted by Agelmar and Kajin. Neither of them wore a
sword; even after what had happened in the night, these were still
the women&rsquo;s apartments. Egwene stopped at the back of the
crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You understand why you cannot go in,&rdquo; Agelmar was
saying. &ldquo;I know that things are different in Andor, but you do
understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t try to go in.&rdquo; Rand sounded as if he had
explained all this more than once already. &ldquo;I told the Lady Nisura
I wanted to see Egwene, and she said Egwene was busy, and I&rsquo;d have
to wait. All I did was shout for her from the door. I did not try
to enter. You&rsquo;d have thought I was naming the Dark One, the way
they all started in on me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Women have their own ways,&rdquo; Kajin said. He was tall
for a Shienaran, almost as tall as Rand, lanky and sallow. His
topknot was black as pitch. &ldquo;They set the rules for the women&rsquo;s
apartments, and we abide by them even when they are foolish.&rdquo; A
number of eyebrows were raised among the women, and he hastily
cleared his throat. &ldquo;You must send a message in if you wish to
speak to one of the women, but it will be delivered when they
choose, and until it is, you must wait. That is our custom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to see her,&rdquo; Rand said stubbornly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
leaving soon. Not soon enough for me, but I still have to see
Egwene. We will get the Horn of Valere and the dagger back, and
that will be the end of it. The end of it. But I want to see her
before I go.&rdquo; Egwene frowned; he sounded odd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No need to be so fierce,&rdquo; Kajin said. &ldquo;You and
Ingtar will find the Horn, or not. And if not, then another will
retrieve it. The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills, and we are but
threads in the Pattern.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not let the Horn seize you, Rand,&rdquo; Agelmar said.
&ldquo;It can take hold of a man&mdash;I know how it can&mdash;and that
is not the way. A man must seek duty, not glory. What will happen,
will happen. If the Horn of Valere is meant to be sounded for the
Light, then it will be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is your Egwene,&rdquo; Kajin said, spotting her.</p>

<p>Agelmar looked around, and nodded when he saw her
with Nisura. &ldquo;I will leave you in her hands, Rand al&rsquo;Thor.
Remember, here, her words are law, not yours. Lady Nisura, do not
be too hard on him. He only wished to see his young woman, and he
does not know our ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene followed Nisura as the Shienaran woman
threaded her way through the watching women. Nisura inclined her
head briefly to Agelmar and Kajin; she pointedly did not include
Rand. Her voice was tight. &ldquo;Lord Agelmar. Lord Kajin. He should
know this much of our ways by now, but he is too big to spank, so I
will let Egwene deal with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Agelmar gave Rand a fatherly pat on the shoulder.
&ldquo;You see. You will speak with her, if not exactly in the way you
wished. Come, Kajin. We have much to see to yet. The Amyrlin still
insists on&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; His voice trailed away as he and the other man
left. Rand stood there, looking at Egwene.</p>

<p>The women were still watching, Egwene realized.
Watching her as well as Rand. Waiting to see what she would do.
<em>So I&rsquo;m supposed to deal with him, am I?</em> Yet she felt her
heart going out to him. His hair needed brushing. His face showed
anger, defiance, and weariness. &ldquo;Walk with me,&rdquo; she told him. A
murmur started up behind them as he walked down the hall beside
her, away from the women&rsquo;s apartments. Rand seemed to be struggling
with himself, hunting for what to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard about your&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;exploits,&rdquo; she said
finally. &ldquo;Running through the women&rsquo;s apartments last night with a
sword. Wearing a sword to an audience with the Amyrlin Seat.&rdquo; He
still said nothing, only walked along frowning at the floor. &ldquo;She
didn&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;hurt you, did she?&rdquo; She could not make herself ask if
he had been gentled; he looked anything but gentle, but she had no
idea what a man looked like afterwards.</p>

<p>He gave a jerk. &ldquo;No. She didn&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Egwene, the
Amyrlin&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He shook his head. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t hurt me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had the feeling he had been going to say
something else entirely. Usually she could ferret out whatever he
wanted to hide from her, but when he really wanted to be stubborn,
she could more easily dig a brick out of a wall with her
fingernails. By the set of his jaw, he was at his most stubborn
right now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did she want with you, Rand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing important. <em>Ta&rsquo;veren</em>. She wanted to
see <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>.&rdquo; His face softened as he looked down at
her. &ldquo;What about you, Egwene? Are you all right? Moiraine said you
would be, but you were so still. I thought you were dead, at
first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo; She laughed. She could not remember
anything that had happened after she had asked Mat to go to the
dungeons with her, not until waking in her own bed that morning.
From what she had heard of the night, she was almost glad she could
not remember. &ldquo;Moiraine said she would have left me a headache for
being foolish if she could have Healed the rest and not that, but
she couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you Fain was dangerous,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I told
you, but you wouldn&rsquo;t listen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the way you are going to talk,&rdquo; she said
firmly, &ldquo;I will give you back to Nisura. She won&rsquo;t talk to you the
way I am. The last man who tried to push his way into the women&rsquo;s
apartments spent a month up to his elbows in soapy water, helping
with the women&rsquo;s laundry, and he was only trying to find his
betrothed and make up an argument. At least he knew enough not to
wear his sword. The Light knows what they&rsquo;d do to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everybody wants to do something to me,&rdquo; he growled.
&ldquo;Everybody wants to use me for something. Well, I won&rsquo;t be used.
Once we find the Horn, and Mat&rsquo;s dagger, I&rsquo;ll never be used
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With an exasperated grunt, she caught his shoulders
and made him face her. She glared up at him. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t start
talking sense, Rand al&rsquo;Thor, I swear I will box your ears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you sound like Nynaeve.&rdquo; He laughed. As he
looked down at her, though, his laughter faded. &ldquo;I suppose&mdash;I
suppose I&rsquo;ll never see you again. I know you have to go to Tar
Valon. I know that. And you&rsquo;ll become an Aes Sedai. I am done with
Aes Sedai, Egwene. I won&rsquo;t be a puppet for them, not for Moiraine,
or any of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked so lost she wanted to put his head on her
shoulder, and so stubborn she really did want to box his ears.
&ldquo;Listen to me, you great ox. I am going to be an Aes Sedai, and
I&rsquo;ll find a way to help you. I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next time you see me, you will likely want to
gentle me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked around hastily; they were alone in their
stretch of the hall. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t watch your tongue, I will not be
able to help you. Do you want everyone to know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too many know already,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Egwene, I wish
things were different, but they aren&rsquo;t. I wish&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Take care of
yourself. And promise me you won&rsquo;t choose the Red Ajah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tears blurred her vision as she threw her arms around
him. &ldquo;You take care of yourself,&rdquo; she said fiercely into his chest.
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She thought she heard him
murmur, &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; and then he was firmly unwrapping her arms,
gently moving her away from him. He turned and strode away from
her, almost running.</p>

<p>She jumped when Nisura touched her arm. &ldquo;He looks as
if you set him a task he won&rsquo;t enjoy. But you mustn&rsquo;t let him see
you cry over it. That negates the purpose. Come. Nynaeve wants
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scrubbing her cheeks, Egwene followed the other
woman. <em>Take care of yourself, you wool-headed lummox. Light,
take care of him</em>.</p>
