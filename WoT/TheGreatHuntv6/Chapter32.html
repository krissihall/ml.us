Barthanes&rsquo;s manor crouched like a huge toad in
the night, covering as much ground as a fortress, with all its
walls and outbuildings. It was no fortress, though, with tall
windows everywhere, and lights, and the sounds of music and
laughter drifting out, yet Rand saw guards moving on the tower tops
and along the roofwalks, and none of the windows were close to the
ground. He got down from Red&rsquo;s back and smoothed his coat, adjusted
his sword belt. The others dismounted around him, at the foot of
broad, whitestone stairs leading up to the wide, heavily carved
doors of the manor.</p>

<p>Ten Shienarans, under Uno, made an escort. The
one-eyed man exchanged small nods with Ingtar before taking his men
to join the other escorts, where ale had been provided and a whole
ox was roasting on a spit by a big fire.</p>

<p>The other ten Shienarans had been left behind, along
with Perrin. Every one of them had to be there for a purpose, Verin
had said, and Perrin had no purpose to serve this night. An escort
was necessary for dignity in Cairhienin eyes, but more than ten
would seem suspicious. Rand was there because he had received the
invitation. Ingtar had come to lend the prestige of his title,
while Loial was there because Ogier were sought after in the upper
reaches of the Cairhienin nobility. Hurin pretended to be Ingtar&rsquo;s
bodyservant. His true purpose was to sniff out the Darkfriends and
Trollocs if he could; the Horn of Valere should not be far from
them. Mat, still grumbling about it, was pretending to be Rand&rsquo;s
servant, since he could feel the dagger when it was close. If Hurin
failed, perhaps he could find the Darkfriends.</p>

<p>When Rand had asked Verin why she was there, she had
only smiled and said, &ldquo;To keep the rest of you out of trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As they mounted the stairs, Mat muttered, &ldquo;I still
don&rsquo;t see why I have to be a servant.&rdquo; He and Hurin followed behind
the others. &ldquo;Burn me, if Rand can be a lord, I can put on a fancy
coat, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A servant,&rdquo; Verin said without looking back at him,
&ldquo;can go many places another man cannot, and many nobles will not
even see him. You and Hurin have your tasks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet now, Mat,&rdquo; Ingtar put in, &ldquo;unless you want
to give us away.&rdquo; They were approaching the doors, where half a
dozen guards stood with the Tree and Crown of House Damodred on
their chests, and an equal number of men in dark green livery with
Tree and Crown on the sleeve.</p>

<p>Taking a deep breath, Rand proffered the invitation.
&ldquo;I am Lord Rand of House al&rsquo;Thor,&rdquo; he said all in a rush, to get it
over with. &ldquo;And these are my guests. Verin Aes Sedai of the Brown
Ajah. Lord Ingtar of House Shinowa, in Shienar. Loial, son of Arent
son of Halan, from Stedding Shangtai.&rdquo; Loial had asked that his
<em>stedding</em> be left out of it, but Verin insisted they needed
every bit of formality they could offer.</p>

<p>The servant who had reached for the invitation with a
perfunctory bow gave a little jerk at each additional name; his
eyes popped at Verin&rsquo;s. In a strangled voice he said, &ldquo;Be welcome
in House Damodred, my lords. Be welcome, Aes Sedai. Be welcome,
friend Ogier.&rdquo; He waved the other servants to open the doors wide,
and bowed Rand and the others inside, where he hurriedly passed the
invitation to another liveried man and whispered in his ear.</p>

<p>This man had the Tree and Crown large on the chest of
his green coat. &ldquo;Aes Sedai,&rdquo; he said, using his long staff to make
a bow, almost bending his head to his knees, to each of them in
turn. &ldquo;My lords. Friend Ogier. I am called Ashin. Please to follow
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The outer hall held only servants, but Ashin led them
to a great room filled with nobles, with a juggler performing at
one end and tumblers at the other. Voices and music coming from
elsewhere said these were not the only guests, or the only
entertainments. The nobles stood in twos, and threes and fours,
sometimes men and women together, sometimes only one or the other,
always with careful space between so no one could overhear what was
said. The guests wore the dark Cairhienin colors, each with bright
stripes at least halfway down his or her chest, and some had them
all the way to their waists. The women had their hair piled high in
elaborate towers of curls, every one different, and their dark
skirts were so wide they would have had to turn sideways to pass
through any doorway narrower than those of the manor. None of the
men had the shaved heads of soldiers&mdash;they all wore dark
velvet hats over long hair, some shaped like bells, others flat&mdash;and, as with the women, lace ruffles like dark ivory almost
hid their hands.</p>

<p>Ashin rapped his staff and announced them in a loud
voice, Verin first.</p>

<p>They drew every eye. Verin wore her brown-fringed
shawl, embroidered in grape vines; the announcement of an Aes Sedai
sent a murmur through the lords and ladies, and made the juggler
drop one of his hoops, though no one was watching him any longer.
Loial received almost as many looks, even before Ashin spoke his
name. Despite the silver embroidery on collar and sleeves, the
otherwise unrelieved black of Rand&rsquo;s coat made him seem almost
stark beside the Cairhienin, and his and Ingtar&rsquo;s swords drew many
glances. None of the lords appeared to be armed. Rand heard the
words &ldquo;heron-mark blade&rdquo; more than once. Some of the glances he was
receiving looked like frowns; he suspected they came from men he
had insulted by burning their invitations.</p>

<p>A slim, handsome man approached. He had long, graying
hair, and multihued stripes crossed the front of his deep gray coat
from his neck almost to the hem just above his knees. He was
extremely tall for a Cairhienin, no more than half a head shorter
than Rand, and he had a way of standing that made him seem even
taller, with his chin up so he seemed to be looking down at
everyone else. His eyes were black pebbles. He looked warily at
Verin, though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grace honors me with your presence, Aes Sedai.&rdquo;
Barthanes Damodred&rsquo;s voice was deep and sure. His gaze swept across
the others. &ldquo;I did not expect so distinguished a company. Lord
Ingtar. Friend Ogier.&rdquo; His bow to each was little more than a nod
of the head; Barthanes knew exactly how powerful he was. &ldquo;And you,
my young Lord Rand. You excite much comment in the city, and in the
Houses. Perhaps we will have a chance to talk this night.&rdquo; His tone
said that he would not miss it if the chance never came, that he
had not been excited to any comment, but his eyes slid a fraction
before he caught them, to Ingtar and Loial, and to Verin. &ldquo;Be
welcome.&rdquo; He let himself be drawn away by a handsome woman who laid
a beringed hand buried in lace on his arm, but his gaze drifted
back to Rand as he walked away.</p>

<p>The murmur of conversation picked up once more, and
the juggler spun his hoops again in a narrow loop that almost
reached the worked plaster ceiling, a good four spans up. The
tumblers had never stopped; a woman leaped into the air from the
cupped hands of one of her compatriots, her oiled skin shining in
the light of a hundred lamps as she spun, and landed on her feet on
the hands of a man who was already standing atop another&rsquo;s
shoulders. He lifted her up on outstretched arms as the man below
raised him in the same way, and she spread her arms as if for
applause. None of the Cairhienin seemed to notice.</p>

<p>Verin and Ingtar drifted into the crowd. The
Shienaran received a few wary looks; some looked at the Aes Sedai
with wide eyes, others with the worried frowns of those finding a
rabid wolf within arm&rsquo;s reach. The latter came from men more often
than women, and some of the women spoke to her.</p>

<p>Rand realized that Mat and Hurin had already
disappeared to the kitchens, where all the servants who had come
with the guests would be gathering until sent for. He hoped they
would not have trouble sneaking away.</p>

<p>Loial bent down to speak for his ear alone. &ldquo;Rand,
there is a Waygate nearby. I can feel it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean this was an Ogier grove?&rdquo; Rand said softly,
and Loial nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stedding Tsofu had not been found again when it was
planted, or the Ogier who helped build Al&rsquo;cair&rsquo;rahienallen would
not have needed a grove to remind them of the <em>stedding</em>.
This was all forest when I came through Cairhien before, and
belonged to the King.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Barthanes probably took it away in some plot.&rdquo; Rand
looked around the room nervously. Everyone was still talking, but
more than a few were watching the Ogier and him. He could not see
Ingtar. Verin stood at the center of a knot of women. &ldquo;I wish we
could stay together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Verin says not, Rand. She says it would make them
all suspicious and angry, thinking we were holding ourselves aloof.
We have to allay suspicion until Mat and Hurin find whatever they
find.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard what she said as well as you, Loial. But I
still say, if Barthanes is a Darkfriend, then he must know why
we&rsquo;re here. Going off by ourselves is just asking to be knocked on
the head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Verin says he won&rsquo;t do anything until he finds out
whether he can make use of us. Just do what she told us, Rand. Aes
Sedai know what they are about.&rdquo; Loial walked into the crowd,
gathering a circle of lords and ladies before he had gone ten
steps.</p>

<p>Others started toward Rand, now that he was alone,
but he turned in the other direction and hurried away. <em>Aes
Sedai may know what they&rsquo;re about, but I wish I did. I don&rsquo;t like
this. Light, but I wish I knew if she was telling the truth. Aes
Sedai never lie, but the truth you hear may not be the truth you
think it is.</em></p>

<p>He kept moving to avoid talking with the nobles.
There were many other rooms, all filled with lords and ladies, all
with entertainers: three different gleemen in their cloaks, more
jugglers and tumblers, and musicians playing flutes, bitterns,
dulcimers, and lutes, plus five different sizes of fiddle, six
kinds of horn, straight or curved or curled, and ten sizes of drum
from tambour to kettle. He gave some of the horn players a second
look, those with curled horns, but the instruments were all plain
brass.</p>

<p><em>They wouldn&rsquo;t have the Horn of Valere out here
fool</em>, he thought. <em>Not unless Barthanes means to have dead
heroes come as part of the entertainment</em>.</p>

<p>There was even a bard in silver-worked Tairen boots
and a yellow coat, strolling through the rooms plucking his harp
and sometimes stopping to declaim in High Chant. He glared
contemptuously at the gleemen and did not linger in the rooms where
they were, but Rand saw little difference between him and them
except for their clothes.</p>

<p>Suddenly Barthanes was walking by Rand&rsquo;s side. A
liveried servant immediately offered his silver tray with a bow.
Barthanes took a blown-glass goblet of wine. Walking backwards
ahead of them still bowing, the servant held the tray toward Rand
until Rand shook his head, then melted into the crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem restless,&rdquo; Barthanes said, sipping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like to walk.&rdquo; Rand wondered how to follow Verin&rsquo;s
advice, and remembering what she had said about his visit to the
Amyrlin, he settled into Cat Crosses the Courtyard. He
knew no more arrogant way to walk than that. Barthanes&rsquo;s mouth
tightened, and Rand thought perhaps the lord found it too arrogant,
but Verin&rsquo;s advice was all he had to go by, so he did not stop. To
take some of the edge off, he said pleasantly, &ldquo;This is a fine
party. You have many friends, and I&rsquo;ve never seen so many
entertainers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many friends,&rdquo; Barthanes agreed. &ldquo;You can tell
Galldrian how many, and who. Some of the names might surprise
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never met the King, Lord Barthanes, and I
don&rsquo;t expect I ever will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. You just happened to be in that flyspeck
village. You were not checking on the progress of retrieving that
statue. A great undertaking, that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He had begun thinking of Verin again, wishing
she had given him some advice on how to talk with a man who assumed
he was lying. He added without thinking, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s dangerous to meddle
with things from the Age of Legends if you don&rsquo;t know what you are
doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barthanes peered into his wine, musing as if Rand had
just said something profound. &ldquo;Are you saying you do not support
Galldrian in this?&rdquo; he asked finally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you, I&rsquo;ve never met the King.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. I did not know Andormen played at
the Great Game so well. We do not see many here in Cairhien.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand took a deep breath to stop from telling the man
angrily that he was not playing their Game. &ldquo;There are many grain
barges from Andor in the river.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Merchants and traders. Who notices such as they? As
well notice the beetles on the leaves.&rdquo; Barthanes&rsquo;s voice carried
equal contempt for both beetles and merchants, but once again he
frowned as if Rand had hinted at something. &ldquo;Not many men travel in
company with Aes Sedai. You seem too young to be a Warder. I
suppose Lord Ingtar is Verin Sedai&rsquo;s Warder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are who we said we are,&rdquo; Rand said, and grimaced.
<em>Except me</em>.</p>

<p>Barthanes was studying Rand&rsquo;s face almost openly.
&ldquo;Young. Young to carry a heron-mark blade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am less than a year old,&rdquo; Rand said automatically,
and immediately wished he had it back. It sounded foolish, to his
ear, but Verin had said act as he had with the Amyrlin Seat, and
that was the answer Lan had given him. A Borderman considered the
day he was given his sword to be his nameday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So. An Andorman, and yet Borderland-trained. Or is
it Warder-trained?&rdquo; Barthanes&rsquo;s eyes narrowed, studying Rand. &ldquo;I
understand Morgase has only one son. Named Gawyn, I have heard. You
must be much like him in age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have met him,&rdquo; Rand said cautiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those eyes. That hair. I have heard the Andoran
royal line has almost Aiel coloring in their hair and eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stumbled, though the floor was smooth marble.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not Aiel, Lord Barthanes, and I&rsquo;m not of the royal line,
either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you say. You have given me much to think on. I
believe we may find common ground when we talk again.&rdquo; Barthanes
nodded and raised his glass in a small salute, then turned to speak
to a gray-haired man with many stripes of color down his coat.</p>

<p>Rand shook his head and moved on, away from more
conversation. It had been bad enough talking to one Cairhienin
lord; he did not want to risk two. Barthanes appeared to find deep
meanings in the most trivial comments. Rand realized he had just
now learned enough of <em>Daes Dae&rsquo;mar</em> to know he had no idea
at all how it was played. <em>Mat, Hurin, find something fast, so
we can get out of here. These people are crazy</em>.</p>

<p>And then he entered another room, and the gleeman at
the end of it, strumming his harp and reciting a tale from <em>The
Great Hunt of the Horn</em>, was Thom Merrilin. Rand stopped dead.
Thom did not seem to see him, though the gleeman&rsquo;s gaze passed over
him twice. It seemed that Thom had meant what he said. A clean
break.</p>

<p>Rand turned to go, but a woman stepped smoothly in
front of him and put a hand on his chest, the lace falling back
from a soft wrist. Her head did not quite come to his shoulder, but
her tall array of curls easily reached as high as his eyes. The
high neck of her gown put lace ruffles under her chin, and stripes
covered the front of her dark blue dress below her breasts. &ldquo;I am
Alaine Chuliandred, and you are the famous Rand al&rsquo;Thor. In
Barthanes&rsquo;s own manor, I suppose he has the right to speak to you
first, but we are all fascinated by what we hear of you. I even
hear that you play the flute. Can it be true?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I play the flute.&rdquo; <em>How did she</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? <em>
Caldevwin. Light, everybody does hear everything in Cairhien</em>.
&ldquo;If you will excuse&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard that some outland lords play music, but
I never believed it. I would like very much to hear you play.
Perhaps you will talk with me, of this and that. Barthanes seemed
to find your conversation fascinating. My husband spends his days
sampling his own vineyards, and leaves me quite alone. He is never
there to talk with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must miss him,&rdquo; Rand said, trying to edge around
her and her wide skirts. She gave a tinkling laugh as if he had
said the funniest thing in the world.</p>

<p>Another woman sidled in beside the first, and another
hand was laid on his chest. She wore as many stripes as Alaine, and
they were of an age, a good ten years older than he. &ldquo;Do you think
to keep him to yourself, Alaine?&rdquo; The two women smiled at each
other while their eyes threw daggers. The second turned her smile
on Rand. &ldquo;I am Belevaere Osiellin. Are all Andormen so tall? And so
handsome?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He cleared his throat. &ldquo;Ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;some are as tall.
Pardon me, but if you will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw you talking with Barthanes. They say you know
Galldrian, as well. You must come to see me, and talk. My husband
is visiting our estates in the south.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have the sublety of a tavern wench,&rdquo; Alaine
hissed at her, and immediately was smiling up at Rand. &ldquo;She has no
polish. No man could like a woman with a manner so rough. Bring
your flute to my manor, and we will talk. Perhaps you will teach me
to play?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What Alaine thinks of as subtlety,&rdquo; Belevaere said
sweetly, &ldquo;is but lack of courage. A man who wears a heron-mark
sword must be brave. That truly is a heron-mark blade, is it
not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand tried backing away from them. &ldquo;If you will just
excuse me, I&mdash;&rdquo; They followed step for step until his back
hit the wall; the width of their skirts together made another wall
in front of him.</p>

<p>He jumped as a third woman crowded in beside the
other two, her skirts joining theirs to the wall on that side. She
was older than they, but just as pretty, with an amused smile that
did not lessen the sharpness of her eyes. She wore half again as
many stripes as Alaine and Belevaere; they made tiny curtsies and
glared at her sullenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are these two spiders trying to toil you in their
webs?&rdquo; The older woman laughed. &ldquo;Half the time they tangle
themselves more firmly than anyone else. Come with me, my fine
young Andoran, and I will tell you some of the troubles they would
give you. For one thing, I have no husband to worry about. Husbands
always make trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Over Alaine&rsquo;s head he could see Thom, straightening
from a bow to no applause or notice whatsoever. With a grimace the
gleeman snatched a goblet from the tray of a startled servant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see someone I must speak to,&rdquo; Rand told the women,
and squeezed out of the box they had put him in just as the last
woman reached for his arm. All three stared after him as he hurried
to the gleeman.</p>

<p>Thom eyed him over the lip of the goblet, then took
another long swallow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thom, I know you said a clean break, but I had to
get away from those women. All they wanted to talk about was their
husbands being away, but they were already hinting at other
things.&rdquo; Thom choked on his wine, and Rand slapped his back. &ldquo;You
drink too fast, and something always goes down the wrong way. Thom,
they think I am plotting with Barthanes, or maybe Galldrian, and I
don&rsquo;t think they will believe me when I say I&rsquo;m not. I just needed
an excuse to leave them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom stroked his long mustaches with one knuckle and
peered across the room at the three women. They were still standing
together, watching Rand and him. &ldquo;I recognize those three, boy.
Breane Taborwin alone would give you an education such as every man
should have at least once in his life, if he can live through it.
Worried about their husbands. I like that, boy.&rdquo; Abruptly his eyes
sharpened. &ldquo;You told me you were clear of Aes Sedai. Half the talk
here tonight is of the Andoran <em>lord</em> appearing with no
warning, and an Aes Sedai at his side. Barthanes and Galldrian.
You&rsquo;ve let the White Tower put you in the cooking pot this
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She only came yesterday, Thom. And as soon as the
Horn is safe, I&rsquo;ll be free of them again. I mean to see to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sound as if it isn&rsquo;t safe now,&rdquo; Thom said
slowly. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t sound that way before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Darkfriends stole it, Thom. They brought it here.
Barthanes is one of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom seemed to study his wine, but his eyes darted to
make sure no one was close enough to listen. More than the three
women were watching them with sideways glances while pretending to
talk among themselves, but every knot maintained its distance from
every other. Still, Thom spoke softly. &ldquo;A dangerous thing to say if
it isn&rsquo;t true, and more dangerous if it is. An accusation like
that, against the most powerful man in the kingdom&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;You say he
has the Horn? I suppose you&rsquo;re after my help again, now that you&rsquo;re
tangled with the White Tower once more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He had decided Thom had been right, even if the
gleeman did not know why. He could not involve anyone else in his
troubles. &ldquo;I just wanted to get away from those women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gleeman blew out his mustaches, taken aback.
&ldquo;Well. Yes. That is well. The last time I helped you, I got a limp
out of it, and you seem to have let yourself be tied to Tar Valon
strings again. You&rsquo;ll have to get yourself out of it this time.&rdquo; He
sounded as if he were trying to convince himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will, Thom. I will.&rdquo; <em>Just as soon as the Horn
is safe and Mat has that bloody dagger back. Mat, Hurin, where are
you?</em></p>

<p>As if the thought had been a summons, Hurin appeared
in the room, eyes searching among the lords and ladies. They looked
through him; servants did not exist unless needed. When he found
Rand and Thom, he made his way between the small clusters of nobles
and bowed to Rand. &ldquo;My Lord, I was sent to tell you. Your
manservant had a fall and twisted his knee. I don&rsquo;t know how bad,
my Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Rand stared before he understood.
Conscious of all the eyes on him, he spoke loudly enough for the
nobles closest to overhear. &ldquo;Clumsy fool. What good is he to me if
he can&rsquo;t walk? I suppose I&rsquo;d better come see how badly he&rsquo;s hurt
himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed to be the right thing to say. Hurin sounded
relieved when he bowed again and said, &ldquo;As my Lord wishes. If my
Lord will follow me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You play very well at being a lord,&rdquo; Thom said
softly. &ldquo;But remember this. Cairhienin may play <em>Daes
Dae&rsquo;mar</em>, but it was the White Tower made the Great Game in the
first place. Watch yourself, boy.&rdquo; With a glare at the nobles, he
set his empty goblet on the tray of a passing servant and strolled
away, plucking his harp. He began reciting <em>Goodwife Mili and
the Silk Merchant</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lead on, man,&rdquo; Rand told Hurin, feeling foolish. As
he followed the sniffer out of the room, he could feel the eyes
following him.</p>
