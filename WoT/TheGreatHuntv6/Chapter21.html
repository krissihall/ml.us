<h4><em>The Nine Rings</em></h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">R</span>and
expected the common room to be empty, since it
was nearly suppertime, but half a dozen men crowded one table,
dicing among their jacks of ale, and another sat by himself over a
meal. Though the dicers carried no weapons in sight and wore no
armor, only plain coats and breeches of dark blue, something about
the way they held themselves told Rand they were soldiers. His eyes
went to the solitary man. An officer, with the tops of his high
boots turned down, and his sword propped against the table beside
his chair. A single slash of red and one of yellow crossed the
chest of the officer&rsquo;s blue coat from shoulder to shoulder, and the
front of his head was shaved, though his black hair hung long in
the back. The soldiers&rsquo; hair was clipped short, as if it all had
been cut under the same bowl. All seven turned to look as Rand and
the others came in.</p>

<p>The innkeeper was a lean woman with a long nose and
graying hair, but her wrinkles seemed part of her ready smile more
than anything else. She came bustling up, wiping her hands on a
spotless white apron. &ldquo;Good even to you&rdquo;&mdash;her quick eyes took
in Rand&rsquo;s gold-embroidered red coat, and Selene&rsquo;s fine white dress&mdash;&ldquo;my Lord, my Lady. I am Maglin Madwen, my Lord. Be welcome
to The Nine Rings. And an Ogier. Not many of your kind come this
way, friend Ogier. Would you be up from Stedding Tsofu, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial managed an awkward half bow under the weight of
the chest. &ldquo;No, good innkeeper. I come the other way, from the
Borderlands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From the Borderlands, you say. Well. And you, my
Lord? Forgive me for asking, but you&rsquo;ve not the look of the
Borderlands, if you don&rsquo;t mind my saying it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m from the Two Rivers, Mistress Madwen, in Andor.&rdquo;
He glanced at Selene&mdash;she did not seem to admit he existed;
her level look barely admitted that the room existed, or anyone in
it. &ldquo;The Lady Selene is from Cairhien, from the capital, and I am
from Andor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you say, my Lord.&rdquo; Mistress Madwen&rsquo;s glance
flickered to Rand&rsquo;s sword; the bronze herons were plain on scabbard
and hilt. She frowned slightly, but her face was clear again in a
blink. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be wanting a meal for yourself and your beautiful
Lady, and your followers. And rooms, I expect. I&rsquo;ll have your
horses seen to. I&rsquo;ve a good table for you, right this way, and pork
with yellow peppers on the fire. Would you be hunting the Horn of
Valere, then, my Lord, you and your Lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the act of following her, Rand almost stumbled.
&ldquo;No! Why would you think we were?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No offense, my Lord. We&rsquo;ve had two through here
already, all polished to look like heroes&mdash;not to suggest
anything of the kind about you, my Lord&mdash;in the last month. Not many
strangers come here, except traders up from the capital to buy oats
and barley. I&rsquo;d not suppose the Hunt has left Illian, yet, but
maybe some don&rsquo;t think they really need the blessing, and they&rsquo;ll
get a jump on the others by missing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are not hunting the Horn, mistress.&rdquo; Rand did not
glance at the bundle in Loial&rsquo;s arms; the blanket with its colorful
stripes hung bunched over the Ogier&rsquo;s thick arms and disguised the
chest well. &ldquo;We surely are not. We are on our way to the
capital.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you say, my Lord. Forgive me for asking, but is
your Lady well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Selene looked at her, and spoke for the first time.
&ldquo;I am quite well.&rdquo; Her voice left a chill in the air that stifled
talk for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not Cairhienin, Mistress Madwen,&rdquo; Hurin said
suddenly. Burdened down with their saddlebags and Rand&rsquo;s bundle, he
looked like a walking baggage cart. &ldquo;Pardon, but you don&rsquo;t sound
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mistress Madwen&rsquo;s eyebrows rose, and she shot a
glance at Rand, then grinned. &ldquo;I should have known you&rsquo;d let your
man speak freely, but I&rsquo;ve grown used to&mdash;&rdquo; Her glance darted
toward the officer, who had gone back to his own meal. &ldquo;Light, no,
I&rsquo;m not Cairhienin, but for my sins, I married one. Twenty-three
years I lived with him, and when he died on me&mdash;the Light
shine on him&mdash;I was all ready to go back to Lugard, but he
had the last laugh, he did. He left me the inn, and his brother the
money, when I was sure it would be the other way round. Tricksome
and scheming, Barin was, like every man I&rsquo;ve ever known, Cairhienin
most of all. Will you be seated, my Lord? My Lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The innkeeper gave a surprised blink when Hurin sat
at table with them&mdash;an Ogier, it seemed, was one thing, but
Hurin was clearly a servant in her eyes. With another quick look at
Rand, she bustled off to the kitchens, and soon serving girls came
with their meal, giggling and staring at the lord and the lady, and
the Ogier, till Mistress Madwen chased them back to their work.</p>

<p>At first, Rand stared at his food doubtfully. The
pork was cut in small bits, mixed with long strips of yellow
peppers, and peas, and a number of vegetables and things he did not
recognize, all in some sort of clear, thick sauce. It smelled sweet
and sharp, both at the same time. Selene only picked at hers, but
Loial was eating with a will.</p>

<p>Hurin grinned at Rand over his fork. &ldquo;They spice
their food oddly, Cairhienin do, Lord Rand, but for all that, it&rsquo;s
not bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t bite you, Rand,&rdquo; Loial added.</p>

<p>Rand took a hesitant mouthful, and almost gasped. It
tasted just as it smelled, sweet and sharp together, the pork crisp
on the outside and tender inside, a dozen different flavors,
spices, all blending and contrasting. It tasted like nothing he had
ever put in his mouth before. It tasted wonderful. He cleaned his
plate, and when Mistress Madwen returned with the serving girls to
clear away, he nearly asked for more the way Loial did. Selene&rsquo;s
was still half full, but she motioned curtly for one of the girls
to take it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pleasure, friend Ogier.&rdquo; The innkeeper smiled. &ldquo;It
takes a lot to fill up one of you. Catrine, bring another helping,
and be quick.&rdquo; One of the girls darted away. Mistress Madwen turned
her smile on Rand. &ldquo;My Lord, I had a man here who played the
bittern, but he married a girl off one of the farms, and she has
him strumming reins behind a plow, now. I couldn&rsquo;t help noticing
what looks like a flute case sticking out of your man&rsquo;s bundle.
Since my musician&rsquo;s gone, would you let your man favor us with a
little music?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hurin looked embarrassed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t play,&rdquo; Rand explained. &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman blinked. It appeared lords did not play the
flute, at least not in Cairhien. &ldquo;I withdraw the request, my Lord.
Light&rsquo;s own truth, I meant no offense, I assure you. I&rsquo;d never ask
one such as yourself to be playing in a common room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand hesitated only a moment. It had been too long
since he had practiced the flute rather than the sword, and the
coins in his pouch would not last forever. Once he was rid of his
fancy clothes&mdash;once he turned the Horn over to Ingtar and the
dagger over to Mat&mdash;he would need the flute to earn his
supper again while he searched for somewhere safe from Aes Sedai.
<em>And safe from myself? Something did happen back there.
What?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Hurin, hand me the case.
Just slide it out.&rdquo; There was no need to show a gleeman&rsquo;s cloak;
enough unspoken questions shone in Mistress Madwen&rsquo;s dark eyes as
it was.</p>

<p>Worked gold chased with silver, the instrument looked
the sort a lord might play, if lords anywhere played the flute. The
heron branded on his right palm did not interfere with his
fingering. Selene&rsquo;s salves had worked so well he hardly thought of
the brand unless he saw it. Yet it was in his thoughts now, and
unconsciously he began to play &ldquo;Heron on the Wing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hurin bobbed his head to the tune, and Loial beat
time on the table with a thick finger. Selene looked at Rand as if
wondering what he was&mdash;<em>I&rsquo;m not a lord, my Lady. I&rsquo;m a
shepherd, and I play the flute in common rooms</em>&mdash;but the
soldiers turned from their talk to listen, and the officer closed
the wooden cover of the book he had begun reading. Selene&rsquo;s steady
gaze struck a stubborn spark inside Rand. Determinedly he avoided
any song that might fit in a palace, or a lord&rsquo;s manor. He played
&ldquo;Only One Bucket of Water&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Old Two Rivers
Leaf,&rdquo; &ldquo;Old Jak&rsquo;s Up a Tree&rdquo; and &ldquo;Goodman Priket&rsquo;s Pipe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With the last, the six soldiers began to sing in
raucous tones, though not the words Rand knew.</p>

<p class="verse_quote">&ldquo;We rode down to River Iralell<br>
just to see the Tairen come.<br>
We stood along the riverbank<br>
with the rising of the sun.<br>
Their horses blacked the summer plain,<br>
their banners blacked the sky.<br>
But we stood our ground on the banks of River Iralell.<br>
Oh, we stood our ground.<br>
Yes, we stood our ground.<br>
Stood our ground along the river in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not the first time that Rand had discovered a
tune had different words and different names in different lands,
sometimes even in villages in the same land. He played along with
them until they let the words die away, slapping each other&rsquo;s
shoulders and making rude comments on one another&rsquo;s singing.</p>

<p>When Rand lowered the flute, the officer rose and
made a sharp gesture. The soldiers fell silent in mid-laugh,
scraped back their chairs to bow to the officer with hand on breast&mdash;and to Rand&mdash;and left without a backwards look.</p>

<p>The officer came to Rand&rsquo;s table and bowed, hand to
heart; the shaven front of his head looked as if he had dusted it
with white powder. &ldquo;Grace favor you, my Lord. I trust they did not
bother you, singing as they did. They are a common sort, but they
meant no insult, I assure you. I am Aldrin Caldevwin, my Lord,
Captain in His Majesty&rsquo;s Service, the Light illumine him.&rdquo; His eyes
slid over Rand&rsquo;s sword; Rand had the feeling Caldevwin had noticed
the herons as soon as he came in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t insult me.&rdquo; The officer&rsquo;s accent
reminded him of Moiraine&rsquo;s, precise and every word pronounced to
its full. <em>Did she really let me go? I wonder if she&rsquo;s following
me. Or waiting for me</em>. &ldquo;Sit down, Captain. Please.&rdquo; Caldevwin
drew a chair from another table. &ldquo;Tell me, Captain, if you don&rsquo;t
mind. Have you seen any other strangers recently? A lady, short and
slender, and a fighting man with blue eyes. He&rsquo;s tall, and
sometimes he wears his sword on his back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen no strangers at all,&rdquo; he said, lowering
himself stiffly to his seat. &ldquo;Saving yourself and your Lady, my
Lord. Few of the nobility ever come here.&rdquo; His eyes flicked toward
Loial with a minute frown; Hurin he ignored for a servant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was only a thought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Under the Light, my Lord, I mean no disrespect, but
may I hear your name? We have so few strangers here that I find I
wish to know every one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand gave it&mdash;he claimed no title, but the
officer seemed not to notice&mdash;and said as he had to the
innkeeper, &ldquo;From the Two Rivers, in Andor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A wondrous place I have heard, Lord Rand&mdash;I
may call you so?&mdash;and fine men, the Andormen. No Cairhienin
has ever worn a blademaster&rsquo;s sword so young as you. I met some
Andormen, once, the Captain-General of the Queen&rsquo;s Guards among
them. I do not remember his name; an embarrassment. Perhaps you
could favor me with it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand was conscious of the serving girls in the
background, beginning to clean and sweep. Caldevwin seemed only to
be making conversation, but there was a probing quality to his
look. &ldquo;Gareth Bryne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. Young, to hold so much
responsibility.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand kept his voice level. &ldquo;Gareth Bryne has enough
gray in his hair to be your father, Captain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, my Lord Rand. I meant to say that he
came to it young.&rdquo; Caldevwin turned to Selene, and for a moment he
only stared. He shook himself, finally, as if coming out of a
trance. &ldquo;Forgive me for looking at you so, my Lady, and forgive me
for speaking so, but Grace has surely favored you. Will you give me
a name to put to such beauty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just as Selene opened her mouth, one of the serving
girls let out a cry and dropped a lamp she was taking down from a
shelf. Oil splattered, and caught in a pool of flame on the floor.
Rand leaped to his feet along with the others at the table, but
before any of them could move, Mistress Madwen appeared, and she
and the girl smothered the flames with their aprons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have told you to be careful, Catrine,&rdquo; the
innkeeper said, shaking her now-smutty apron under the girl&rsquo;s nose.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be burning the inn down, and yourself in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl seemed on the point of tears. &ldquo;I was being
careful, Mistress, but I had such a twinge in my arm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mistress Madwen threw up her hands. &ldquo;You always have
some excuse, and you still break more dishes than all the rest. Ah,
it&rsquo;s all right. Clean it up, and don&rsquo;t burn yourself.&rdquo; The
innkeeper turned to Rand and the others, all still standing around
the table. &ldquo;I hope none of you take this amiss. The girl really
won&rsquo;t burn down the inn. She&rsquo;s hard on the dishes when she starts
mooning over some young fellow, but she&rsquo;s never mishandled a lamp
before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like to be shown to my room. I do not feel
well after all.&rdquo; Selene spoke in careful tones, as though uncertain
of her stomach, but despite that she looked and sounded as cool and
calm as ever. &ldquo;The journey, and the fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The innkeeper clucked like a mother hen. &ldquo;Of course,
my Lady. I have a fine room for you and your Lord. Shall I fetch
Mother Caredwain? She has a fine hand with soothing herbs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Selene&rsquo;s voice sharpened. &ldquo;No. And I wish a room by
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mistress Madwen glanced at Rand, but the next moment
she was bowing Selene solicitously toward the stairs. &ldquo;As you wish,
my Lady. Lidan, fetch the Lady&rsquo;s things like a good girl, now.&rdquo; One
of the serving girls ran to take Selene&rsquo;s saddlebags from Hurin,
and the women disappeared upstairs, Selene stiff-backed and
silent.</p>

<p>Caldevwin stared after them until they were gone,
then shook himself again. He waited until Rand had seated himself
before taking his chair again. &ldquo;Forgive me, my Lord Rand, for
staring so at your Lady, but Grace has surely favored you in her. I
mean no insult.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None taken,&rdquo; Rand said. He wondered if every man
felt the way he did when they looked at Selene. &ldquo;As I was riding to
the village, Captain, I saw a huge sphere. Crystal, it seemed. What
is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Cairhienin&rsquo;s eyes sharpened. &ldquo;It is part of the
statue, my Lord Rand,&rdquo; he said slowly. His gaze flickered toward
Loial; for an instant he seemed to be considering something
new.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Statue? I saw a hand, and a face, too. It must be
huge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is, my Lord Rand. And old.&rdquo; Caldevwin paused.
&ldquo;From the Age of Legends, so I am told.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand felt a chill. The Age of Legends, when use of
the One Power was everywhere, if the stories could be believed.
<em>What happened there? I know there was something</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Age of Legends,&rdquo; Loial said. &ldquo;Yes, it must be.
No one has done work so vast since. A great piece of work to dig
that up, Captain.&rdquo; Hurin sat silently, as if he not only was not
listening, but was not there at all.</p>

<p>Caldevwin nodded reluctantly. &ldquo;I have five hundred
laborers in camp beyond the diggings, and even so it will be past
summer&rsquo;s end before we have it clear. They are men from the
Foregate. Half my work is to keep them digging, and the other half
to keep them out of this village. Foregaters have a fondness for
drinking and carousing, you understand, and these people lead quiet
lives.&rdquo; His tone said his sympathies were all with the
villagers.</p>

<p>Rand nodded. He had no interest in Foregaters,
whoever they were. &ldquo;What will you do with it?&rdquo; The captain
hesitated, but Rand only looked back at him until he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Galldrian himself has ordered that it be taken to
the capital.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial blinked. &ldquo;A very great piece of work, that. I
am not sure how something that big could be moved so far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His Majesty has ordered it,&rdquo; Caldevwin said sharply.
&ldquo;It will be set up outside the city, a monument to the greatness of
Cairhien and of House Riatin. Ogier are not the only ones who know
how to move stone.&rdquo; Loial looked abashed, and the captain visibly
calmed himself. &ldquo;Your pardon, friend Ogier. I spoke in haste, and
rudely.&rdquo; He still sounded a little gruff. &ldquo;Will you be staying in
Tremonsien long, my Lord Rand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We leave in the morning,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;We are going
to Cairhien.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As it happens, I am sending some of my men back to
the city tomorrow. I must rotate them; they grow stale after too
long watching men swing picks and shovels. You will not mind if
they ride in your company?&rdquo; He put it as a question, but as if
acceptance were a foregone conclusion. Mistress Madwen appeared on
the stairs, and he rose. &ldquo;If you will excuse me, my Lord Rand, I
must be up early. Until the morning, then. Grace favor you.&rdquo; He
bowed to Rand, nodded to Loial, and left.</p>

<p>As the doors closed behind the Cairhienin, the
innkeeper came to the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have your Lady settled, my Lord. And I&rsquo;ve good
rooms prepared for you and your man, and you, friend Ogier.&rdquo; She
paused, studying Rand. &ldquo;Forgive me if I overstep myself, my Lord,
but I think I can speak freely to a lord who lets his man speak up.
If I&rsquo;m wrong&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well, I mean no insult. For twenty-three years
Barin Madwen and I were arguing when we weren&rsquo;t kissing, so to
speak. That&rsquo;s by way of saying I have some experience. Right now,
you&rsquo;re thinking your Lady never wants to see you again, but it&rsquo;s my
way of thinking that if you tap on her door tonight, she&rsquo;ll be
taking you in. Smile and say it was your fault, whether it was or
not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand cleared his throat and hoped his face was not
turning red. <em>Light, Egwene would kill me if she knew I&rsquo;d even
thought of it. And Selene would kill me if I did it. Or would
she?</em> That did make his cheeks burn. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;thank you for
your suggestion, Mistress Madwen. The rooms&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He avoided
looking at the blanket-covered chest by Loial&rsquo;s chair; they did not
dare leave it without someone awake and guarding it. &ldquo;We three will
all sleep in the same room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The innkeeper looked startled, but she recovered
quickly. &ldquo;As you wish, my Lord. This way, if you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand followed her up the stairs. Loial carried the
chest under its blanket&mdash;the stairs groaned under the weight
of him and the chest together, but the innkeeper seemed to think it
was just an Ogier&rsquo;s bulk&mdash;and Hurin still carried all the
saddlebags and the bundled cloak with the harp and flute.</p>

<p>Mistress Madwen had a third bed brought in and
hastily assembled and made up. One of the beds already there
stretched nearly from wall to wall in length, and had obviously
been meant for Loial from the start. There was barely room to walk
between the beds. As soon as the innkeeper was gone, Rand turned to
the others. Loial had pushed the still-covered chest under his bed
and was trying the mattress. Hurin was setting out the
saddlebags.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do either of you know why that captain was so
suspicious of us? He was, I&rsquo;m sure of it.&rdquo; He shook his head. &ldquo;I
almost think he thought we might steal that statue, the way he was
talking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Daes Dae&rsquo;mar</em>, Lord Rand,&rdquo; Hurin said. &ldquo;The
Great Game. The Game of Houses, some call it. This Caldevwin thinks
you must be doing something to your advantage or you wouldn&rsquo;t be
here. And whatever you&rsquo;re doing might be to his disadvantage, so he
has to be careful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shook his head. &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;The Great Game&rsquo;? What
game?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a game at all, Rand,&rdquo; Loial said from his
bed. He had pulled a book from his pocket, but it lay unopened on
his chest. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much about it&mdash;Ogier don&rsquo;t do such
things&mdash;but I have heard of it. The nobles and the noble
Houses maneuver for advantage. They do things they think will help
them, or hurt an enemy, or both. Usually, it&rsquo;s all done in secrecy,
or if not, they try to make it seem as if they&rsquo;re doing something
other than what they are.&rdquo; He gave one tufted ear a puzzled
scratch. &ldquo;Even knowing what it is, I don&rsquo;t understand it. Elder
Haman always said it would take a greater mind than his to
understand the things humans do, and I don&rsquo;t know many as
intelligent as Elder Haman. You humans are odd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hurin gave the Ogier a slanted look, but he said, &ldquo;He
has the right of <em>Daes Dae&rsquo;mar</em>, Lord Rand. Cairhienin play
it more than most, though all southerners do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These soldiers in the morning,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;Are they
part of Caldevwin playing this Great Game? We can&rsquo;t afford to get
mixed in anything like that.&rdquo; There was no need to mention the
Horn. They were all too aware of its presence.</p>

<p>Loial shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Rand. He&rsquo;s
human, so it could mean anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, either.&rdquo; Hurin sounded as worried as
the Ogier looked. &ldquo;He could be doing just what he said, or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;That&rsquo;s the way of the Game of Houses. You never know. I spent most
of my time in Cairhien in the Foregate, Lord Rand, and I don&rsquo;t know
much about Cairhienin nobles, but&mdash;well, <em>Daes Dae&rsquo;mar</em>
can be dangerous anywhere, but especially in Cairhien, I&rsquo;ve heard.&rdquo;
He brightened suddenly. &ldquo;The Lady Selene, Lord Rand. She&rsquo;ll know
better than me or the Builder. You can ask her in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But in the morning, Selene was gone. When Rand went
down to the common room, Mistress Madwen handed him a sealed
parchment. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll forgive me, my Lord, you should have listened
to me. You should have tapped on your Lady&rsquo;s door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand waited until she went away before he broke the
white wax seal. The wax had been impressed with a crescent moon and
stars.</p>

<p class="note">I must leave you for a time. There are too many people here,
and I do not like Caldevwin. I will await you in Cairhien. Never
think that I am too far from you. You will be in my thoughts
always, as I know that I am in yours.</p>

<p>It was not signed, but that elegant, flowing script
had the look of Selene.</p>

<p>He folded it carefully and put it in his pocket
before going outside, where Hurin had the horses waiting.</p>

<p>Captain Caldevwin was there, too, with another,
younger officer and fifty mounted soldiers crowding the street. The
two officers were bare-headed, but wore steel-backed gauntlets, and
gold-worked breastplates strapped over their blue coats. A short
staff was fastened to the harness on each officer&rsquo;s back, bearing a
small, stiff blue banner above his head. Caldevwin&rsquo;s banner bore a
single white star, while the younger man&rsquo;s was crossed by two white
bars. They were a sharp contrast to the soldiers in their plain
armor and helmets that looked like bells with metal cut away to
expose their faces.</p>

<p>Caldevwin bowed as Rand came out of the inn. &ldquo;Good
morning to you, my Lord Rand. This is Elricain Tavolin, who will
command your escort, if I may call it that.&rdquo; The other officer
bowed; his head was shaved as Caldevwin&rsquo;s was. He did not
speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An escort will be welcome, Captain,&rdquo; Rand said,
managing to sound at ease. Fain would not try anything against
fifty soldiers, but Rand wished he could be certain they were only
an escort.</p>

<p>The captain eyed Loial, on his way to his horse with
the blanket-covered chest. &ldquo;A heavy burden, Ogier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial almost missed a step. &ldquo;I never like to be far
from my books, Captain.&rdquo; His wide mouth flashed teeth in a
self-conscious grin, and he hurried to strap the chest onto his
saddle.</p>

<p>Caldevwin looked around, frowning. &ldquo;Your Lady is not
down yet. And her fine animal is not here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She left already,&rdquo; Rand told him. &ldquo;She had to go on
to Cairhien quickly, during the night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Caldevwin&rsquo;s eyebrows lifted. &ldquo;During the night? But
my men&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Forgive me, my Lord Rand.&rdquo; He drew the younger officer
aside, whispering furiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had the inn watched, Lord Rand,&rdquo; Hurin whispered.
&ldquo;The Lady Selene must have gotten past them unseen somehow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand climbed to Red&rsquo;s saddle with a grimace. If there
had been any chance Caldevwin did not suspect them of something, it
seemed Selene had finished it. &ldquo;Too many people, she says,&rdquo; he
muttered. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be more people by far in Cairhien.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You said something, my Lord?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand looked up as Tavolin joined him, mounted on a
tall, dust-colored gelding. Hurin was in his saddle, too, and Loial
stood beside his big horse&rsquo;s head. The soldiers were formed up in
ranks. Caldevwin was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing is happening the way I expect,&rdquo; Rand
said.</p>

<p>Tavolin gave him a brief smile, hardly more than a
twitch of his lips. &ldquo;Shall we ride, my Lord?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The strange procession headed for the hard-packed
road that led to the city of Cairhien.</p>
