<h4><em>The Flame of Tar Valon</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass
leaving memories that become legend, then fade to myth, and are
long forgot when that Age comes again. In one Age, called the Third
Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose in
the Mountains of Dhoom. The wind was not the beginning. There are
neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time.
But it was <em>a</em> beginning.</p>

<p>Born among black, knife-edged peaks, where death
roamed the high passes yet hid from things still more dangerous,
the wind blew south across the tangled forest of the Great Blight,
a forest tainted and twisted by the touch of the Dark One. The
sickly sweet smell of corruption faded by the time the wind crossed
that invisible line men called the border of Shienar, where spring
flowers hung thick in the trees. It should have been summer by now,
but spring had been late in coming, and the land had run wild to
catch up. New-come pale green bristled on every bush, and red new
growth tipped every tree branch. The wind rippled farmers&rsquo; fields
like verdant ponds, solid with crops that almost seemed to creep
upward visibly.</p>

<p>The smell of death was all but gone long before the
wind reached the stone-walled town of Fal Dara on its hills, and
whipped around a tower of the fortress in the very center of the
town, a tower atop which two men seemed to dance. Hard-walled and
high, Fal Dara, both keep and town, never taken, never betrayed.
The wind moaned across wood-shingled rooftops, around tall stone
chimneys and taller towers, moaned like a dirge.</p>

<p>Stripped to the waist, Rand al&rsquo;Thor shivered at the
wind&rsquo;s cold caress, and his fingers flexed on the long hilt of the
practice sword he held. The hot sun had slicked his chest, and his
dark, reddish hair clung to his head in a sweat-curled mat. A faint
odor in the swirl of air made his nose twitch, but he did not
connect the smell with the image of an old grave fresh-opened that
flashed through his head. He was barely aware of odor or image at
all; he strove to keep his mind empty, but the other man sharing
the tower top with him kept intruding on the emptiness. Ten paces
across, the tower top was, encircled by a chest-high, crenellated
wall. Big enough and more not to feel crowded, except when shared
with a Warder.</p>

<p>Young as he was, Rand was taller than most men, but
Lan stood just as tall and more heavily muscled, if not quite so
broad in the shoulders. A narrow band of braided leather held the
Warder&rsquo;s long hair back from his face, a face that seemed made from
stony planes and angles, a face unlined as if to belie the tinge of
gray at his temples. Despite the heat and exertion, only a light
coat of sweat glistened on his chest and arms. Rand searched Lan&rsquo;s
icy blue eyes, hunting for some hint of what the other man
intended. The Warder never seemed to blink, and the practice sword
in his hands moved surely and smoothly as he flowed from one stance
to another.</p>

<p>With a bundle of thin, loosely bound staves in place
of a blade, the practice sword would make a loud clack when it
struck anything, and leave a welt where it hit flesh. Rand knew all
too well. Three thin red lines stung on his ribs, and another
burned his shoulder. It had taken all his efforts not to wear more
decorations. Lan bore not a mark.</p>

<p>As he had been taught, Rand formed a single flame in
his mind and concentrated on it, tried to feed all emotion and
passion into it, to form a void within himself, with even thought
outside. Emptiness came. As was too often the case of late it was
not a perfect emptiness; the flame still remained, or some sense of
light sending ripples through the stillness. But it was enough,
barely. The cool peace of the void crept over him, and he was one
with the practice sword, with the smooth stones under his boots,
even with Lan. All was one, and he moved without thought in a
rhythm that matched the Warder&rsquo;s step for step and move for
move.</p>

<p>The wind rose again, bringing the ringing of bells
from the town. <em>Somebody&rsquo;s still celebrating that spring has
finally come</em>. The extraneous thought fluttered through the
void on waves of light, disturbing the emptiness, and as if the
Warder could read Rand&rsquo;s mind, the practice sword whirled in Lan&rsquo;s
hands.</p>

<p>For a long minute the swift
<em>clack-clack-clack</em> of bundled lathes meeting filled the
tower top. Rand made no effort to reach the other man; it was all
he could do to keep the Warder&rsquo;s strikes from reaching him. Turning
Lan&rsquo;s blows at the last possible moment, he was forced back. Lan&rsquo;s
expression never changed; the practice sword seemed alive in his
hands. Abruptly the Warder&rsquo;s swinging slash changed in mid-motion
to a thrust. Caught by surprise, Rand stepped back, already wincing
with the blow he knew he could not stop this time.</p>

<p>The wind howled across the tower&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and trapped
him. It was as if the air had suddenly jelled, holding him in a
cocoon. Pushing him forward. Time and motion slowed; horrified, he
watched Lan&rsquo;s practice sword drift toward his chest. There was
nothing slow or soft about the impact. His ribs creaked as if he
had been struck with a hammer. He grunted, but the wind would not
allow him to give way; it still carried him forward, instead. The
lathes of Lan&rsquo;s practice sword flexed and bent&mdash;ever so
slowly, it seemed to Rand&mdash;then shattered, sharp points
oozing toward his heart, jagged lathes piercing his skin. Pain
lanced through his body; his whole skin felt slashed. He burned as
though the sun had flared to crisp him like bacon in a pan.</p>

<p>With a shout, he threw himself stumbling back,
falling against the stone wall. Hand trembling, he touched the
gashes on his chest and raised bloody fingers before his gray eyes
in disbelief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what was that fool move, sheepherder?&rdquo; Lan
grated. &ldquo;You know better by now, or should unless you have
forgotten everything I&rsquo;ve tried to teach you. How badly are you&mdash;?&rdquo; He cut off as Rand looked up at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wind.&rdquo; Rand&rsquo;s mouth was dry. &ldquo;It&mdash;it
pushed me! It&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;It was solid as a wall!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Warder stared at him in silence, then offered a
hand. Rand took it and let himself be pulled to his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strange things can happen this close to the Blight,&rdquo;
Lan said finally, but for all the flatness of the words he sounded
troubled. That in itself was strange. Warders, those half-legendary
warriors who served the Aes Sedai, seldom showed emotion, and Lan
showed little even for a Warder. He tossed the shattered lathe
sword aside and leaned against the wall where their real swords
lay, out of the way of their practice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not like that,&rdquo; Rand protested. He joined the other
man, squatting with his back against the stone. That way the top of
the wall was higher than his head, protection of a kind from the
wind. If it was a wind. No wind had ever felt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;solid&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;like that. &ldquo;Peace! Maybe not even <em>in</em> the Blight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For someone like you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Lan shrugged as if that
explained everything. &ldquo;How long before you leave, sheepherder? A
month since you said you were going, and I thought you&rsquo;d be three
weeks gone by now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stared up at him in surprise. <em>He&rsquo;s acting
like nothing happened!</em> Frowning, he set down the practice
sword and lifted his real sword to his knees, fingers running along
the long, leather-wrapped hilt inset with a bronze heron. Another
bronze heron stood on the scabbard, and yet another was scribed on
the sheathed blade. It was still a little strange to him that he
had a sword. Any sword, much less one with a blademaster&rsquo;s mark. He
was a farmer from the Two Rivers, so far away, now. Maybe far away
forever, now. He was a shepherd like his father&mdash;<em>I</em>
was <em>a shepherd. What am I now?</em>&mdash;and his father had
given him a heron-marked sword. <em>Tam</em> is <em>my father, no
matter what anybody says</em>. He wished his own thoughts did not
sound as if he was trying to convince himself.</p>

<p>Again Lan seemed to read his mind. &ldquo;In the
Borderlands, sheepherder, if a man has the raising of a child, that
child is his, and none can say different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scowling, Rand ignored the Warder&rsquo;s words. It was no
one&rsquo;s business but his own. &ldquo;I want to learn how to use this. I
need to.&rdquo; It had caused him problems, carrying a heron-marked
sword. Not everybody knew what it meant, or even noticed it, but
even so a heron-mark blade, especially in the hands of a youth
barely old enough to be called a man, still attracted the wrong
sort of attention. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been able to bluff sometimes, when I could
not run, and I&rsquo;ve been lucky, besides. But what happens when I
can&rsquo;t run, and I can&rsquo;t bluff, and my luck runs out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could sell it,&rdquo; Lan said carefully. &ldquo;That blade
is rare even among heron-mark swords. It would fetch a pretty
price.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; It was an idea he had thought of more than
once, but he rejected it now for the same reason he always had, and
more fiercely for coming from someone else. <em>As long as I keep
it, I have the right to call Tam father. He gave it to me, and it
gives me the right</em>. &ldquo;I thought any heron-mark blade was
rare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan gave him a sidelong look. &ldquo;Tam didn&rsquo;t tell you,
then? He must know. Perhaps he didn&rsquo;t believe. Many do not.&rdquo; He
snatched up his own sword, almost the twin of Rand&rsquo;s except for the
lack of herons, and whipped off the scabbard. The blade, slightly
curved and single-edged, glittered silvery in the sunlight.</p>

<p>It was the sword of the kings of Malkier. Lan did not
speak of it&mdash;he did not even like others to speak of it&mdash;but al&rsquo;Lan Mandragoran was Lord of the Seven Towers, Lord of
the Lakes, and uncrowned King of Malkier. The Seven Towers were
broken now, and the Thousand Lakes the lair of unclean things.
Malkier lay swallowed by the Great Blight, and of all the Malkieri
lords, only one still lived.</p>

<p>Some said Lan had become a Warder, bonding himself to
an Aes Sedai, so he could seek death in the Blight and join the
rest of his blood. Rand had indeed seen Lan put himself in harm&rsquo;s
way seemingly without regard for his own safety, but far beyond his
own life and safety he held those of Moiraine, the Aes Sedai who
held his bond. Rand did not think Lan would truly seek death while
Moiraine lived.</p>

<p>Turning his blade in the light, Lan spoke. &ldquo;In the
War of the Shadow, the One Power itself was used as a weapon, and
weapons were made with the One Power. Some weapons used the One
Power, things that could destroy an entire city at one blow, lay
waste to the land for leagues. Just as well those were all lost in
the Breaking; just as well no one remembers the making of them. But
there were simpler weapons, too, for those who would face
Myrddraal, and worse things the Dreadlords made, blade to
blade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With the One Power, Aes Sedai drew iron and other
metals from the earth, smelted them, formed and wrought them. All
with the Power. Swords, and other weapons, too. Many that survived
the Breaking of the World were destroyed by men who feared and
hated Aes Sedai work, and others have vanished with the years. Few
remain, and few men truly know what they are. There have been
legends of them, swollen tales of swords that seemed to have a
power of their own. You&rsquo;ve heard the gleemen&rsquo;s tales. The reality
is enough. Blades that will not shatter or break, and never lose
their edge. I&rsquo;ve seen men sharpening them&mdash;playing at
sharpening, as it were&mdash;but only because they could not believe
a sword did not need it after use. All they ever did was wear away
their oilstones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those weapons the Aes Sedai made, and there will
never be others. When it was done, war and Age ended together, with
the world shattered, with more dead unburied than there were alive
and those alive fleeing, trying to find some place, any place, of
safety, with every second woman weeping because she&rsquo;d never see
husband or sons again; when it was done, the Aes Sedai who still
lived swore they would never again make a weapon for one man to
kill another. Every Aes Sedai swore it, and every woman of them
since has kept that oath. Even the Red Ajah, and they care little
what happens to any male.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of those swords, a plain soldier&rsquo;s sword&rdquo;&mdash;with a faint grimace, almost sad, if the Warder could be said to
show emotion, he slid the blade back into its sheath&mdash;&ldquo;became
something more. On the other hand, those made for lord-generals,
with blades so hard no bladesmith could mark them, yet marked
already with a heron, those blades became sought after.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s hands jerked away from the sword propped on
his knees. It toppled, and instinctively he grabbed it before it
hit the floorstones. &ldquo;You mean Aes Sedai made this? I thought you
were talking about <em>your</em> sword.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not all heron-mark blades are Aes Sedai work. Few
men handle a sword with the skill to be named blademaster and be
awarded a heron-mark blade, but even so, not enough Aes Sedai
blades remain for more than a handful to have one. Most come from
master bladesmiths; the finest steel men can make, yet still
wrought by a man&rsquo;s hands. But that one, sheepherder&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that one
could tell a tale of three thousand years and more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get away from them,&rdquo; Rand said, &ldquo;can I?&rdquo; He
balanced the sword in front of him on scabbard point; it looked no
different than it had before he knew. &ldquo;Aes Sedai work.&rdquo; <em>But Tam
gave it to me. My</em> father <em>gave it to me</em>. He refused to
think of how a Two Rivers shepherd had come by a heron-mark blade.
There were dangerous currents in such thoughts, deeps he did not
want to explore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you really want to get away, sheepherder? I&rsquo;ll
ask again. Why are you not gone, then? The sword? In five years I
could make you worthy of it, make you a blademaster. You have quick
wrists, good balance, and you don&rsquo;t make the same mistake twice.
But I do not have five years to give over to teaching you, and you
do not have five years for learning. You have not even one year,
and you know it. As it is, you will not stab yourself in the foot.
You hold yourself as if the sword belongs at your waist,
sheepherder, and most village bullies will sense it. But you&rsquo;ve had
that much almost since the day you put it on. So why are you still
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat and Perrin are still here,&rdquo; Rand mumbled. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want to leave before they do. I won&rsquo;t ever&mdash;I might not
see them again for&mdash;for years, maybe.&rdquo; His head dropped back
against the wall. &ldquo;Blood and ashes! At least they just think I&rsquo;m
crazy not to go home with them. Half the time Nynaeve looks at me
like I&rsquo;m six years old and I&rsquo;ve skinned my knee, and she&rsquo;s going to
make it better; the other half she looks like she&rsquo;s seeing a
stranger. One she might offend if she looks too closely, at that.
She&rsquo;s a Wisdom, and besides that, I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s ever been
afraid of anything, but she&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He shook his head. &ldquo;And Egwene.
Burn me! She knows why I have to go, but every time I mention it
she looks at me, and I knot up inside and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He closed his
eyes, pressing the sword hilt against his forehead as if he could
press what he was thinking out of existence. &ldquo;I wish&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I wish&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wish everything could be the way it was,
sheepherder? Or you wish the girl would go with you instead of to
Tar Valon? You think she&rsquo;ll give up becoming an Aes Sedai for a
life of wandering? With you? If you put it to her in the right way,
she might. Love is an odd thing.&rdquo; Lan sounded suddenly weary. &ldquo;As
odd a thing as there is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; It was what he had been wishing, that she would
want to go with him. He opened his eyes and squared his back and
made his voice firm. &ldquo;No, I wouldn&rsquo;t let her come with me if she
did ask.&rdquo; He could not do that to her. <em>But Light, wouldn&rsquo;t it
be sweet, just for a minute, if she said she wanted to?</em> &ldquo;She
gets muley stubborn if she thinks I&rsquo;m trying to tell her what to
do, but I can still protect her from that.&rdquo; He wished she were back
home in Emond&rsquo;s Field, but all hope of that had gone the day
Moiraine came to the Two Rivers. &ldquo;Even if it means she does become
an Aes Sedai!&rdquo; The corner of his eye caught Lan&rsquo;s raised eyebrow,
and he flushed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that is all the reason? You want to spend as
much time as you can with your friends from home before they go?
That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re dragging your feet? You know what&rsquo;s sniffing at
your heels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand surged angrily to his feet. &ldquo;All right, it&rsquo;s
Moiraine! I wouldn&rsquo;t even be here if not for her, and she won&rsquo;t as
much as talk to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be dead if not for her, sheepherder,&rdquo; Lan said
flatly, but Rand rushed on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She tells me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;tells me horrible things about
myself&rdquo;&mdash;his knuckles whitened on the sword. <em>That I&rsquo;m
going to go mad and die!</em>&mdash;&ldquo;and then suddenly she won&rsquo;t
even say two words to me. She acts as if I&rsquo;m no different than the
day she found me, and that smells wrong, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want her to treat you like what you are?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! I don&rsquo;t mean that. Burn me, I don&rsquo;t know what I
mean half the time. I don&rsquo;t want that, and I&rsquo;m scared of the other.
Now she&rsquo;s gone off somewhere, vanished&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you she needs to be alone sometimes. It isn&rsquo;t
for you, or anyone else, to question her actions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;without telling anybody where she was going,
or when she&rsquo;d be back, or even if she would be back. She has to be
able to tell me something to help me, Lan. Something. She has to.
If she ever comes back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s back, sheepherder. Last night. But I think she
has told you all she can. Be satisfied. You&rsquo;ve learned what you can
from her.&rdquo; With a shake of his head, Lan&rsquo;s voice became brisk. &ldquo;You
certainly aren&rsquo;t learning anything standing there. Time for a
little balance work. Go through Parting the Silk, beginning from
Heron Wading in the Rushes. Remember that that Heron form is only
for practicing balance. Anywhere but doing forms, it leaves you
wide open; you can strike home from it, if you wait for the other
man to move first, but you&rsquo;ll never avoid his blade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She <em>has</em> to be able to tell me something,
Lan. That wind. It wasn&rsquo;t natural, and I don&rsquo;t care how close to
the Blight we are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heron Wading in the Rushes, sheepherder. And mind
your wrists.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the south came a faint peal of trumpets, a
rolling fanfare slowly growing louder, accompanied by the steady
<em>thrum-thrum-THRUM-thrum</em> of drums. For a moment Rand and
Lan stared at each other, then the drums drew them to the tower
wall to stare southward.</p>

<p>The city stood on high hills, the land around the
city walls cleared to ankle height for a full mile in all
directions, and the keep covered the highest hill of all. From the
tower top, Rand had a clear view across the chimneys and roofs to
the forest. The drummers appeared first from the trees, a dozen of
them, drums lifting as they stepped to their own beat, mallets
whirling. Next came trumpeters, long, shining horns raised, still
calling the flourish. At that distance Rand could not make out the
huge, square banner whipping in the wind behind them. Lan grunted,
though; the Warder had eyes like a snow eagle.</p>

<p>Rand glanced at him, but the Warder said nothing, his
eyes intent on the column emerging from the forest. Mounted men in
armor rode out of the trees, and women on horseback, too. Then a
palanquin borne by horses, one before and one behind, its curtains
down, and more men on horseback. Ranks of men afoot, pikes rising
above them like a bristle of long thorns, and archers with their
bows held slanted across their chests, all stepping to the drums.
The trumpets cried again. Like a singing serpent the column wound
its way toward Fal Dara.</p>

<p>The wind flapped the banner, taller than a man,
straight out to one side. As big as it was, it was close enough now
for Rand to see clearly. A swirl of colors that meant nothing to
him, but at the heart of it, a shape like a pure white teardrop.
His breath froze in his throat. The Flame of Tar Valon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ingtar&rsquo;s with them.&rdquo; Lan sounded as if his thoughts
were elsewhere. &ldquo;Back from his hunting at last. Been gone long
enough. I wonder if he had any luck?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Rand whispered when he finally could.
All those women out there&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Moiraine was Aes Sedai, yes, but he
had traveled with her, and if he did not entirely trust her, at
least he knew her. Or thought he did. But she was only one. So many
Aes Sedai together, and coming like this, was something else again.
He cleared his throat; when he spoke, his voice grated. &ldquo;Why so
many, Lan? Why any at all? And with drums and trumpets and a banner
to announce them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aes Sedai were respected in Shienar, at least by most
people, and the rest respectfully feared them, but Rand had been in
places where it was different, where there was only the fear, and
often hate. Where he had grown up, some men, at least, spoke of
&ldquo;Tar Valon witches&rdquo; as they would speak of the Dark One. He tried
to count the women, but they kept no ranks or order, moving their
horses around to converse with one another or with whoever was in
the palanquin. Goose bumps covered him. He had traveled with
Moiraine, and met another Aes Sedai, and he had begun to think of
himself as worldly. Nobody ever left the Two Rivers, or almost
nobody, but he had. He had seen things no one back in the Two
Rivers had ever laid eyes on, done things they had only dreamed of,
if they had dreamed so far. He had seen a queen and met the
Daughter-Heir of Andor, faced a Myrddraal and traveled the Ways,
and none of it had prepared him for this moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why so many?&rdquo; he whispered again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Amyrlin Seat&rsquo;s come in person.&rdquo; Lan looked at
him, his expression as hard and unreadable as a rock. &ldquo;Your lessons
are done, sheepherder.&rdquo; He paused then, and Rand almost thought
there was sympathy on his face. That could not be, of course.
&ldquo;Better for you if you were a week gone.&rdquo; With that the Warder
snatched up his shirt and disappeared down the ladder into the
tower.</p>

<p>Rand worked his mouth, trying to get a little
moisture. He stared at the column approaching Fal Dara as if it
really were a snake, a deadly viper. The drums and trumpets sang,
loud in his ears. The Amyrlin Seat, who ordered the Aes Sedai.
<em>She&rsquo;s come because of me</em>. He could think of no other
reason.</p>

<p>They knew things, had knowledge that could help him,
he was sure. And he did not dare ask any of them. He was afraid
they had come to gentle him. <em>And afraid they haven&rsquo;t, too</em>,
he admitted reluctantly. <em>Light, I don&rsquo;t know which scares me
more</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to channel the Power,&rdquo; he whispered.
&ldquo;It was an accident! Light, I don&rsquo;t want anything to do with it. I
swear I&rsquo;ll never touch it again! I swear it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a start, he realized that the Aes Sedai party
was entering the city gates. The wind swirled up fiercely, chilling
his sweat like droplets of ice, making the trumpets sound like sly
laughter; he thought he could smell an opened grave, strong in the
air. <em>My grave, if I keep standing here</em>.</p>

<p>Grabbing his shirt, he scrambled down the ladder and
began to run.</p>
