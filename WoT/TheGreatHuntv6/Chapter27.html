<h4><em>The Shadow in the Night</em></h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">I</span>
do not understand it,&rdquo; Loial said. &ldquo;I was winning,
most of the time. And then Dena came in and joined the game, and
she won it all right back. Every toss. She called it a little
lesson. What did she mean by that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand and the Ogier were making their way through the
Foregate, The Bunch of Grapes behind them. The sun sat low in the
west, a red ball half below the horizon, throwing long shadows
behind them. The street was empty save for one of the big puppets,
a goat-horned Trolloc with a sword at its belt, coming toward them
with five men working the poles, but sounds of merriment drifted
still from other parts of the Foregate, where the halls of
entertainment and the taverns stood. Here, doors were already
barred and windows shuttered.</p>

<p>Rand stopped fingering the wooden flute case and
slung it on his back. <em>I suppose I couldn&rsquo;t expect him to throw
over everything and come with me, but at least he could talk to me.
Light, I wish Ingtar would show up</em>. He stuffed his hands in
his pockets and felt Selene&rsquo;s note.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose she&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Loial paused
uncomfortably. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose she cheated, do you? Everybody
was grinning as if she were doing something clever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shrugged at his cloak. <em>I have to take the
Horn and go. If we wait for Ingtar, anything can happen. Fain will
come sooner or later. I have to stay ahead of him</em>. The men
with the puppet were almost to them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand,&rdquo; Loial said suddenly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly the men let their poles clatter to the
packed dirt street; instead of collapsing, the Trolloc leaped for
Rand with outstretched hands.</p>

<p>There was no time to think. Instinct brought the
sword out of its sheath in a flashing arc. The Moon Rises Over
the Lakes. The Trolloc staggered back with a bubbling cry,
snarling even as it fell.</p>

<p>For an instant everyone stood frozen. Then the men&mdash;the Darkfriends, they had to be&mdash;looked from the
Trolloc lying in the street to Rand, with the sword in his hands
and Loial at his side. They turned and ran.</p>

<p>Rand was staring at the Trolloc, too. The void had
surrounded him before his hand touched hilt; <em>saidin</em> shone
in his mind, beckoning, sickening. With an effort, he made the void
vanish, and licked his lips. Without the emptiness, fear crawled on
his skin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Loial, we have to get back to the inn. Hurin&rsquo;s
alone, and they&mdash;&rdquo; He grunted as he was lifted into the air
by a thick arm long enough to pin both of his to his chest. A hairy
hand grabbed his throat. He caught sight of a tusked snout just
over his head. A rank smell filled his nose, equal parts sour sweat
and pigsty.</p>

<p>As quickly as it had seized him, the hand at his
throat was torn away. Stunned, Rand stared at it, at the thick
Ogier fingers clutching the Trolloc&rsquo;s wrist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on, Rand.&rdquo; Loial&rsquo;s voice sounded strained. The
Ogier&rsquo;s other hand came around and took hold of the arm still
holding Rand above the ground. &ldquo;Hold on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand was shaken from side to side as Ogier and
Trolloc struggled. Abruptly he fell free. Staggering, he took two
steps to get clear and turned back with sword raised.</p>

<p>Standing behind the boar-snouted Trolloc, Loial had
it by wrist and forearm, holding its arms spread wide, breathing
hard with the effort. The Trolloc snarled gutturally in the harsh
Trolloc tongue, throwing its head back in efforts to catch Loial
with a tusk. Their boots scuffled across the dirt of the
street.</p>

<p>Rand tried to find a place to put his blade in the
Trolloc without hurting Loial, but Ogier and Trolloc spun in their
rough dance so much that he could find no opening.</p>

<p>With a grunt, the Trolloc pulled its left arm free,
but before it could loose itself completely, Loial snapped his own
arm around its neck, hugging the creature close. The Trolloc clawed
at its sword; the scythe-like blade hung on the wrong side for
left-handed use, but inch by inch the dark steel began sliding out
of the scabbard. And still they thrashed about so that Rand could
not strike without risking Loial.</p>

<p><em>The Power</em>. That could do it. How, he did not
know, but he knew nothing else to try. The Trolloc had its sword
half unsheathed. When the curved blade was bare, it would kill
Loial.</p>

<p>Reluctantly, Rand formed the void. <em>Saidin</em>
shone at him, pulled at him. Dimly, he seemed to recall a time when
it had sung to him, but now it only drew him, a flower&rsquo;s perfume
drawing a bee, a midden&rsquo;s stench drawing a fly. He opened himself
up, reached for it. There was nothing there. He could as well have
been reaching for light in truth. The taint slid off onto him,
soiling him, but there was no flow of light inside him. Driven by a
distant desperation, he tried again and again. And again and again
there was only the taint.</p>

<p>With a sudden heave, Loial threw the Trolloc aside,
so hard that the thing cartwheeled against the side of a building.
It struck, headfirst, with a loud crack, and slid down the wall to
lie with its neck twisted at an impossible angle. Loial stood
staring at it, his chest heaving.</p>

<p>Rand looked out of the emptiness for a moment before
he realized what had happened. As soon as he did, though, he let
void and tainted light go, and hurried to Loial&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;killed before, Rand.&rdquo; Loial drew a
shuddering breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would have killed you if you hadn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Rand told
him. Anxiously, he looked at the alleys and shuttered windows and
barred doors. Where there were two Trollocs, there had to be more.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you had to do it, Loial, but it would have killed both
of us, or worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know. But I cannot like it. Even a Trolloc.&rdquo;
Pointing toward the setting sun, the Ogier seized Rand&rsquo;s arm.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Against the sun, Rand could not make out details, but
it appeared to be another group of men with a huge puppet, coming
toward Loial and him. Except that now he knew what to look for, the
&ldquo;puppet&rdquo; moved its legs too naturally, and the snouted head rose to
sniff the air without anyone lifting a pole. He did not think the
Trolloc and Darkfriends could see him among the evening shadows, or
what lay in the street around him; they moved too slowly for that.
Yet it was plain they were hunting, and coming closer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fain knows I am out here somewhere,&rdquo; he said,
hastily wiping his blade on a dead Trolloc&rsquo;s coat. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s set them
to find me. He is afraid of the Trollocs being seen, though, or he
wouldn&rsquo;t have them disguised. If we can reach a street where there
are people, we&rsquo;ll be safe. We have to get back to Hurin. If Fain
finds him, alone with the Horn&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pulled Loial along to the next corner and turned
toward the nearest sounds of laughter and music, but long before
they reached it, another group of men appeared ahead of them in the
otherwise empty street with a puppet that was no puppet. Rand and
Loial took the next turning. It led east.</p>

<p>Every time Rand tried to reach the music and
laughter, there was a Trolloc in the way, often sniffing the air
for a scent. Some Trollocs hunted by scent. Sometimes, here where
there were no eyes to see, a Trolloc stalked alone. More than once
he was sure it was one he had seen before. They were closing in,
and making sure he and Loial did not leave the deserted streets
with their shuttered windows. Slowly the two of them were forced
east, away from the city and Hurin, away from other people, along
narrow, slowly darkening streets that ran in all directions, uphill
and down. Rand eyed the houses they passed, the tall buildings
closed up tight for the night, with more than a little regret. Even
if he pounded on a door until someone opened it, even if they took
Loial and him in, none of the doors he saw would stop a Trolloc.
All that would do would be to offer up more victims with Loial and
himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand,&rdquo; Loial said finally, &ldquo;there is nowhere else to
go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had reached the eastern edge of the Foregate;
the tall buildings to either side of them were the last. Lights in
windows on the upper stories mocked him, but the lower floors were
all shut tight. Ahead lay the hills, cloaked in first twilight and
bare of so much as a farmhouse. Not entirely empty, though. He
could just make out pale walls surrounding one of the larger hills,
perhaps a mile away, and buildings inside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once they push us out there,&rdquo; Loial said, &ldquo;they
won&rsquo;t have to worry who sees them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand gestured to the walls around the hill. &ldquo;Those
should stop a Trolloc. It must be a lord&rsquo;s manner. Maybe they&rsquo;ll
let us in. An Ogier, and an outland lord? This coat has to be good
for something sooner or later.&rdquo; He looked back down the street. No
Trollocs in sight yet, but he drew Loial around the side of the
building anyway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that is the Illuminators&rsquo; chapter house,
Rand. Illuminators guard their secrets tightly. I don&rsquo;t think they
would let Galldrian himself inside there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What trouble have you gotten yourself into now?&rdquo;
said a familiar woman&rsquo;s voice. There was suddenly a spicy perfume
in the air.</p>

<p>Rand stared: Selene stepped around the corner they
had just rounded, her white dress bright in the dimness. &ldquo;How did
you get here? What are you doing here? You have to leave
immediately. Run! There are Trollocs after us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I saw.&rdquo; Her voice was dry, yet cool and composed.
&ldquo;I came to find you, and I find you allowing Trollocs to herd you
like sheep. Can the man who possesses the Horn of Valere let
himself be treated so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have it with me,&rdquo; he snapped, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t
know how it could help if I did. The dead heroes are not supposed
to come back to save me from Trollocs. Selene, you have to get
away. Now!&rdquo; He peered around the corner.</p>

<p>Not more than a hundred paces away, a Trolloc was
sticking its horned head cautiously into the street, smelling the
night. A large shadow by its side had to be another Trolloc, and
there were smaller shadows, too. Darkfriends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too late,&rdquo; Rand muttered. He shifted the flute case
to pull off his cloak and wrap it around her. It was long enough to
hide her white dress entirely, and trail on the ground besides.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to hold that up to run,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;Loial, if they
won&rsquo;t let us in, we will have to find a way to sneak in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Rand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you rather wait for the Trollocs?&rdquo; He gave
Loial a push to start him, and took Selene&rsquo;s hand to follow at a
trot. &ldquo;Find us a path that won&rsquo;t break our necks, Loial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re letting yourself become flustered,&rdquo; Selene
said. She seemed to have less trouble following Loial in the
failing light than Rand did. &ldquo;Seek the Oneness, and be calm. One
who would be great must always be calm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Trollocs might hear you,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want greatness.&rdquo; He thought he heard an irritated grunt from
her.</p>

<p>Stones sometimes turned underfoot, but the way across
the hills was not hard despite the twilight shadows. Trees, and
even brush, had long since been cleared from the hills for
firewood. Nothing grew except knee-high grass that rustled softly
around their legs. A night breeze came up softly. Rand worried that
it might carry their scent to the Trollocs.</p>

<p>Loial stopped when they reached the wall; it stood
twice as high as the Ogier, the stones covered with a whitish
plaster. Rand peered back toward the Foregate. Bands of lighted
windows reached out like spokes of a wheel from the city walls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Loial,&rdquo; he said softly, &ldquo;can you see them? Are they
following us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Ogier looked in the direction of the Foregate,
and nodded unhappily. &ldquo;I only see some of the Trollocs, but they
are coming this way. Running. Rand, I really don&rsquo;t think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Selene cut him off. &ldquo;If he wants to go in, <em>alantin</em>,
he needs a door. Such as that one.&rdquo; She pointed to a dark patch a
little down the wall. Even with her telling him, Rand was not
certain it was a door, but when she strode to it and pulled, it
opened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand,&rdquo; Loial began.</p>

<p>Rand pushed him to the door. &ldquo;Later, Loial. And
softly. We&rsquo;re hiding, remember?&rdquo; He got them inside and closed the
door behind them. There were brackets for a bar, but no bar to be
seen. It would not stop anyone, but maybe the Trollocs would
hesitate to come inside the walls.</p>

<p>They were in an alleyway leading up the hill between
two long, low windowless buildings. At first he thought they were
stone, too, but then he realized the white plaster had been laid
over wood. It was dark enough now for the moon reflecting from the
walls to give a semblance of light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better to be arrested by the Illuminators than taken
by Trollocs,&rdquo; he murmured, starting up the hill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that is what I was trying to tell you,&rdquo; Loial
protested. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard the Illuminators kill intruders. They keep
their secrets hard and fast, Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stopped dead and stared back at the door. The
Trollocs were still out there. At the worst, humans had to be
better to deal with than Trollocs. He might be able to talk the
Illuminators into letting them go; Trollocs did not listen before
they killed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I got you into this, Selene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Danger adds a certain something,&rdquo; she said softly.
&ldquo;And so far, you handle it well. Shall we see what we find?&rdquo; She
brushed past him up the alleyway. Rand followed, the spicy smell of
her filling his nostrils.</p>

<p>Atop the hill, the alleyway opened onto a wide
expanse of smoothly flattened clay, almost as pale as the plaster
and nearly surrounded by more white, windowless buildings with the
shadows of narrow alleys between, but to Rand&rsquo;s right stood one
building with windows, light falling onto the pale clay. He pulled
back into the shadows of the alley as a man and a woman appeared,
walking slowly across the open space.</p>

<p>Their clothes were certainly not Cairhienin. The man
wore breeches as baggy as his shirt sleeves, both in a soft yellow,
with embroidery on the legs of his breeches and across the chest of
his shirt. The woman&rsquo;s dress, worked elaborately across the breast,
seemed a pale green, and her hair was done in a multitude of short
braids.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All is in readiness, you say?&rdquo; the woman demanded.
&ldquo;You are certain, Tammuz? All?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man spread his hands. &ldquo;Always you check behind
me, Aludra. All is in readiness. The display, it could be given
this very moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gates and doors, they are all barred? All of the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; Her voice faded as they moved on to the far end of the
lighted building.</p>

<p>Rand studied the open area, recognizing almost
nothing. In the middle of it, several dozen upright tubes, each
nearly as tall as he and a foot or more across, sat on large wooden
bases. From each tube, a dark, twisted cord ran across the ground
and behind a low wall, perhaps three paces long, on the far side.
All around the open space stood a welter of wooden racks with
troughs and tubes and forked sticks and a score of other
things.</p>

<p>All the fireworks he had ever seen could be held in
one hand, and that was as much as he knew, except that they burst
with a great roar, or whizzed along the ground in spirals of
sparks, or sometimes shot into the air. They always came with
warnings from the Illuminators that opening one could cause it to
go off. In any case, fireworks were too expensive for the Village
Council to have allowed anybody unskilled to open one. He could
well remember the time when Mat had tried to do just that; it was
nearly a week before anyone but Mat&rsquo;s own mother would speak to
him. The only thing that Rand found familiar at all was the
cords&mdash;the fuses. That, he knew, was where you set the fire.</p>

<p>With a glance back at the unbarred door, he motioned
the others to follow and started around the tubes. If they were
going to find a place to hide, he wanted to be as far from that
door as he could.</p>

<p>It meant making their way between the racks, and Rand
held his breath every time he brushed against one. The things in
them shifted with the slightest touch, rattling. All of them seemed
to be made of wood, without a piece of metal. He could imagine the
racket if one were knocked over. He eyed the tall tubes warily,
remembering the bang made by one the size of his finger. If those
were fireworks, he did not want to be this close to them.</p>

<p>Loial muttered to himself continually, especially
when he bumped one of the racks, then started back so fast that he
bumped another. The Ogier crept along in a cloud of clatters and
muttering.</p>

<p>Selene was no less unnerving. She strode as casually
as if they were on a city street. She did not bump anything, did
not make a sound, but she also made no effort to keep the cloak
closed. The white of her dress seemed brighter than all the walls
together. He peered at the lighted windows, waiting for someone to
appear. All it would take was one; Selene could not fail to be
seen, the alarm given.</p>

<p>The windows remained empty, though. Rand was just
breathing a sigh of relief as they approached the low wall&mdash;and the alleys and buildings behind it&mdash;when Loial brushed
against another rack, standing right beside the wall. It held ten
soft-looking sticks, as long as Rand&rsquo;s arm, with thin streams of
smoke rising from their tips. The rack made hardly a sound when it
fell, the smoldering sticks sprawling across one of the fuses. With
a crackling hiss, the fuse burst into flame, and the flame raced
toward one of the tall tubes.</p>

<p>Rand goggled for an instant, then he tried to whisper
a shout. &ldquo;Behind the wall!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Selene made an angry noise when he bore her to the
ground behind the wall, but he did not care. He tried to spread
himself over her protectively as Loial crowded beside them. Waiting
for the tube to burst, he wondered if there would be anything left
of the wall. There was a hollow thump that he felt through the
ground as much as heard. Cautiously, he lifted himself off of
Selene enough to peer around the edge of the wall. She fisted him
in the ribs, hard, and wriggled out from under him with an oath in
a language he did recognize, but he was beyond noticing.</p>

<p>A trickle of smoke was leaking from the top of one of
the tubes. That was all. He shook his head wonderingly. <em>If
that&rsquo;s all there is to it</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With a crash like thunder, a huge flower of red and
white bloomed high in the now dark sky, then slowly began drifting
away in sparkles.</p>

<p>As he goggled at it, the lighted building erupted
with noise. Shouting men and women filled the windows, staring and
pointing.</p>

<p>Rand longingly eyed the dark alleyway, only a dozen
steps away. And the first step would be in full view of the people
at the windows. Pounding feet poured from the building.</p>

<p>He pressed Loial and Selene back against the wall,
hoping they looked like just another shadow. &ldquo;Be still and be
silent,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our only hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; Selene said quietly, &ldquo;if you are very
still, no one can see you at all.&rdquo; She did not sound the least bit
worried.</p>

<p>Boots thumped back and forth on the other side of the
wall, and voices were raised in anger. Especially the one Rand
recognized as Aludra.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You great buffoon, Tammuz! You great pig, you! Your
mother, she was a goat, Tammuz! One day you will kill us all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not to blame for this, Aludra,&rdquo; the man
protested. &ldquo;I have been sure to put everything where it belonged,
and the punks, they were&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will not speak to me, Tammuz! A great pig does
not deserve to speak like a human!&rdquo; Aludra&rsquo;s voice changed in
answer to another man&rsquo;s question. &ldquo;There is no time to prepare
another. Galldrian, he must be satisfied with the rest for tonight.
And one early. And you, Tammuz! You will set everything right, and
tomorrow you will leave with the carts to buy the manure. Does
anything else go wrong this night, I will not trust you again even
with so much as the manure!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Footsteps faded back toward the building to the
accompaniment of Aludra&rsquo;s muttering. Tammuz remained, growling
under his breath about the unfairness of it all.</p>

<p>Rand stopped breathing as the man came over to right
the toppled stand. Pressed back in the shadows against the wall, he
could see Tammuz&rsquo;s back and shoulder. All the man had to do was
turn his head, and he could not miss seeing Rand and the others.
Still complaining to himself, Tammuz arranged the smoldering sticks
in the stand, then stalked off toward the building where everyone
else had gone.</p>

<p>Letting his breath go, Rand took a quick look after
the man, then pulled back into the shadows. A few people still
stood at the windows. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t expect any more luck tonight,&rdquo; he
whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is said great men make their own luck,&rdquo; Selene
said softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you stop that,&rdquo; he told her wearily. He wished
the smell of her did not fill his head so; it made it hard to think
clearly. He could remember the feel of her body when he pushed her
down&mdash;softness and firmness in a disturbing blend&mdash;and
that did not help either.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand?&rdquo; Loial was peering around the end of the wall
away from the lighted building. &ldquo;I think we need some more luck,
Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shifted to look over the Ogier&rsquo;s shoulder.
Beyond open space, in the alleyway that led to the barless door,
three Trollocs were peering cautiously out of the shadows toward
the lighted windows. One woman was standing at a window; she did
not seem to see the Trollocs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Selene said quietly. &ldquo;It becomes a trap. These
people may kill you if they take you. The Trollocs surely will. But
perhaps you can slay the Trollocs too quickly for them to make any
outcry. Perhaps you can stop the people from killing you to
preserve their little secrets. You may not want greatness, but it
will take a great man to do these things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to sound happy about it,&rdquo; Rand said.
He tried to stop thinking about how she smelled, how she felt, and
the void almost surrounded him. He shook it away. The Trollocs did
not seem to have located them, yet. He settled back, staring at the
nearest dark alleyway. Once they made a move toward it, the
Trollocs would surely see, and so would the woman at the window. It
would be a race as to whether Trollocs or Illuminators reached them
first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your greatness will make me happy.&rdquo; Despite the
words, Selene sounded angry. &ldquo;Perhaps I should leave you to find
your own way for a time. If you&rsquo;ll not take greatness when it is in
your grasp, perhaps you deserve to die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand refused to look at her. &ldquo;Loial, can you see if
there&rsquo;s another door down that alley?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Ogier shook his head. &ldquo;There is too much light
here and too much dark there. If I were in the alley, yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand fingered the hilt of his sword. &ldquo;Take Selene. As
soon as you see a door&mdash;<em>if</em> you do&mdash;call out,
and I&rsquo;ll follow. If there isn&rsquo;t a door at the end, you will have to
lift her so she can reach the top of the wall and climb over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Rand.&rdquo; Loial sounded worried. &ldquo;But when
we move, those Trollocs will come after us, no matter who is
watching. Even if there is a door, they will be on our heels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You let me worry about the Trollocs.&rdquo; <em>Three of
them. I might do it, with the void</em>. The thought of <em>
saidin</em> decided him. Too many strange things had happened when
he let the male half of the True Source come close. &ldquo;I will follow
as soon as I can. Go.&rdquo; He turned to peer around the wall at the
Trollocs.</p>

<p>From the corner of his eye, he had an impression of
Loial&rsquo;s bulk moving, of Selene&rsquo;s white dress, half covered by his
cloak. One of the Trollocs beyond the tubes pointed to them
excitedly, but still the three hesitated, glancing up at the window
where the woman still watched. <em>Three of them. There has to be a
way. Not the void. Not</em> saidin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a door!&rdquo; came Loial&rsquo;s soft call. One of the
Trollocs took a step out of the shadows, and the others followed,
gathering themselves. As from a distance, Rand heard the woman at
the window cry out, and Loial shouted something.</p>

<p>Without thinking, Rand was on his feet. He had to
stop the Trollocs somehow, or they would run him down, and Loial
and Selene. He snatched one of the smoldering sticks and hurled
himself at the nearest tube. It tilted, started to fall over, and
he caught the square wooden base; the tube pointed straight at the
Trollocs. They slowed uncertainly&mdash;the woman at the window
screamed&mdash;and Rand touched the smoking end of the stick to
the fuse right where it joined the tube.</p>

<p>The hollow thump came immediately, and the thick
wooden base slammed against him, knocking him down. A roar like a
thunderclap broke the night and a blinding burst of light tore away
the dark.</p>

<p>Blinking, Rand staggered his feet, coughing in thick,
acrid smoke, ears ringing. He stared in amazement. Half the tubes
and all of the racks lay on their sides, and one corner of the
building beside which the Trollocs had stood was simply gone,
flames licking at ends of planks and rafters. Of the Trollocs there
was no sign.</p>

<p>Through the ringing in his ears, Rand heard shouts
from the Illuminators in the building. He broke into a tottering
run, lumbered into the alley. Halfway down it he stumbled over
something and realized it was his cloak. He snatched it up without
pausing. Behind him, the cries of the Illuminators filled the
night.</p>

<p>Loial was bouncing impatiently on his feet beside the
open door. And he was alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Selene?&rdquo; Rand demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She went back, Rand. I tried to grab her, and she
slipped right out of my hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand turned back toward the noise. Through the
incessant sound in his ears, some of the shouts were barely
distinguishable. There was light there, now, from the flames.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sand buckets! Fetch the sand buckets
quickly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is disaster! Disaster!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of them went that way!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial grabbed Rand&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;You cannot help her,
Rand. Not by being taken yourself. We must go.&rdquo; Someone appeared at
the end of the alley, a shadow outlined by the glow of flames
behind, and pointed toward them. &ldquo;Come on, Rand!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand let himself be pulled out of the door into the
darkness. The fire faded behind them until it was only a glow in
the night, and the lights of the Foregate came closer. Rand almost
wished more Trollocs would appear, something he could fight. But
there was only the night breeze ruffling the grass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tried to stop her,&rdquo; Loial said. There was a long
silence. &ldquo;We really couldn&rsquo;t have done anything. They would just
have taken us, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand sighed. &ldquo;I know, Loial. You did what you could.&rdquo;
He walked backwards a few steps, staring at the glow. It seemed
less; the Illuminators must be putting out the flames. &ldquo;I have to
help her somehow.&rdquo; <em>How?</em> Saidin? <em>The Power?</em> He
shivered. &ldquo;I have to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went through the Foregate by the lighted
streets, wrapped in a silence that shut out the gaiety around
them.</p>

<p>When they entered The Defender of the Dragonwall, the
innkeeper held out his tray with a sealed parchment.</p>

<p>Rand took it, and stared at the white seal. A
crescent moon and stars. &ldquo;Who left this? When?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An old woman, my Lord. Not a quarter of an hour
gone. A servant, though she did not say from what House.&rdquo; Cuale
smiled as if inviting confidences.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Rand said, still staring at the seal.
The innkeeper watched them go upstairs with a thoughtful look.</p>

<p>Hurin took his pipe out of his mouth when Rand and
Loial entered the room. Hurin had his short sword and sword-breaker
on the table, wiping them with an oily rag. &ldquo;You were long with the
gleeman, my Lord. Is he well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand gave a start. &ldquo;What? Thom? Yes, he&rsquo;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He
broke open the seal with his thumb and read.</p>

<p class="note">When I think I know what you are going to do, you do
something else. You are a dangerous man. Perhaps it will not be
long before we are together again. Think of the Horn. Think of the
glory. And think of me, for you are always mine.</p>

<p>Again, it bore no signature but the flowing hand
itself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are all women crazy?&rdquo; Rand demanded of the ceiling.
Hurin shrugged. Rand threw himself into the other chair, the one
sized for an Ogier; his feet dangled above the floor, but he did
not care. He stared at the blanket-covered chest under the edge of
Loial&rsquo;s bed. <em>Think of the glory</em>. &ldquo;I wish Ingtar would
come.&rdquo;</p>
