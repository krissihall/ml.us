<h4><em>Choices</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">W</span>e&rsquo;ll
run for it,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;Hurin, can you gallop
and still follow the trail?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Lord Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then push on. We will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do any good,&rdquo; Selene said. Her white mare
was the only one of their mounts not dancing at the gruff barks
coming from the <em>grolm</em>. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t give up, not ever. Once
they have your scent, <em>grolm</em> keep coming, day and night,
until they run you down. You must kill them all, or find a way to
go elsewhere. Rand, the Portal Stone can take us elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! We <em>can</em> kill them. I can. I already
killed one. There are only five. If I can just find&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He cast
around for the spot he needed, and found it. &ldquo;Follow me!&rdquo; Digging
his heels in, he set Red to a gallop, confident before he heard
their hooves that the others would come.</p>

<p>The place he had chosen was a low, round hill, bare
of trees. Nothing could come close without him seeing. He swung
down from his saddle and unlimbered his longbow. Loial and Hurin
joined him on the ground, the Ogier hefting his huge quarterstaff,
the sniffer with his short sword in his fist. Neither quarterstaff
nor sword would be of much use if the <em>grolm</em> closed with
them. <em>I won&rsquo;t let them get close</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This risk is not necessary,&rdquo; Selene said. She barely
looked toward the <em>grolm</em>, bending from her saddle to
concentrate on Rand. &ldquo;We can easily reach the Portal Stone ahead of
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will stop them.&rdquo; Hastily Rand counted the arrows
remaining in his quiver. Eighteen, each as long as his arm, ten of
them with points like chisels, designed to drive through Trolloc
armor. They would do as well for <em>grolm</em> as for Trollocs. He
stuck four of those upright in the ground in front of him; a fifth
he nocked to the bow. &ldquo;Loial, Hurin, you can do no good down here.
Mount and be ready to take Selene to the Stone if any get through.&rdquo;
He wondered whether he could kill one of the things with his sword,
if it came to that. <em>You</em> are <em>mad! Even the Power is not
as bad as this</em>.</p>

<p>Loial said something, but he did not hear; he was
already seeking the void, as much to escape his own thoughts as for
need. <em>You know what&rsquo;s waiting. But this way I don&rsquo;t have to
touch it</em>. The glow was there, the light just out of sight. It
seemed to flow toward him, but the emptiness was all. Thoughts
darted across the surface of the void, visible in that tainted
light. <em>Saidin. The Power. Madness. Death</em>. Extraneous
thoughts. He was one with the bow, with the arrow, with the things
topping the next rise.</p>

<p>The <em>grolm</em> came on, overreaching one another
in their leaps, five great, leathery shapes, triple-eyed, with
horny maws gaping. Their grunting calls rebounded from the void,
barely heard.</p>

<p>Rand was not aware of raising his bow, or drawing the
fletching against his cheek, to his ear. He was one with the
beasts, one with the center eye of the first. Then the arrow was
gone. The first <em>grolm</em> died; one of its companions leaped
on it as it fell, beak of a mouth ripping gobbets of flesh. It
snarled at the others, and they circled wide. But they came on, and
as if compelled, it abandoned its meal and leaped after them, its
horny maw already bloody.</p>

<p>Rand worked smoothly, unconsciously, nock and
release. Nock and release.</p>

<p>The fifth arrow left his bow, and he lowered it,
still deep in the void, as the fourth <em>grolm</em> fell like a
huge puppet with its strings cut. Though the final arrow still
flew, somehow he knew there was no need for another shot. The last
beast collapsed as if its bones had melted, a feathered shaft
jutting from its center eye. Always the center eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Magnificent, Lord Rand,&rdquo; Hurin said. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve
never seen shooting like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The void held Rand. The light called to him, and he&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;reached&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;toward it. It surrounded him, filled him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord Rand?&rdquo; Hurin touched his arm, and Rand gave a
start, the emptiness filling up with what was around him. &ldquo;Are you
all right, my Lord?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand brushed his forehead with fingertips. It was
dry; he felt as if it should have been covered with sweat. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m fine, Hurin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It grows easier each time you do it, I&rsquo;ve heard,&rdquo;
Selene said. &ldquo;The more you live in the Oneness, the easier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand glanced at her. &ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t need it again,
not for a while.&rdquo; <em>What happened? I wanted to</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He
still wanted to, he realized with horror. He <em>wanted</em> to go back into
the void, wanted to feel that light filling him again. It had
seemed as if he were truly alive then, sickliness and all, and now
was only an imitation. No, worse. He had been almost alive, knowing
what &ldquo;alive&rdquo; would be like. All he had to do was reach out to <em>
saidin</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not again,&rdquo; he muttered. He gazed off at the dead
<em>grolm</em>, five monstrous shapes lying on the ground. Not
dangerous anymore. &ldquo;Now we can be on our&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A coughing bark, all too familiar, sounded beyond the
dead <em>grolm</em>, beyond the next hill, and others answered it.
Still more came, from the east, from the west.</p>

<p>Rand half raised his bow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many arrows do you have left?&rdquo; Selene demanded.
&ldquo;Can you kill twenty <em>grolm</em>? Thirty? A hundred? We must go
to the Portal Stone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is right, Rand,&rdquo; Loial said slowly. &ldquo;You do not
have any choice now.&rdquo; Hurin was watching Rand anxiously. The <em>
grolm</em> called, a score of barks overlapping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Stone,&rdquo; Rand agreed reluctantly. Angrily he
threw himself back into his saddle, slung the bow on his back.
&ldquo;Lead us to this Stone, Selene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a nod she turned her mare and heeled it to a
trot. Rand and the others followed, they eagerly, he holding back.
The barks of <em>grolm</em> pursued them, hundreds it seemed. It
sounded as if the <em>grolm</em> were ranged in a semicircle around
them, closing in from every direction but the front.</p>

<p>Swiftly and surely Selene led them through the hills.
The land rose in the beginning of mountains, slopes steepening so
the horses scrambled over washed-out looking rocky outcrops and the
sparse, faded-looking brush that clung to them. The way became
harder, the land slanting more and more upward.</p>

<p><em>We&rsquo;re not going to make it</em>, Rand thought,
the fifth time Red slipped and slid backwards in a shower of stone.
Loial threw his quarterstaff aside; it would be of no use against
<em>grolm</em>, and it only slowed him. The Ogier had given up
riding; he used one hand to haul himself up, and pulled his tall
horse behind him with the other. The hairy-fetlocked animal made
heavy going, but easier than with Loial on its back. <em>Grolm</em>
barked behind them, closer now.</p>

<p>Then Selene drew rein and pointed to a hollow nestled
below them in the granite. It was all there, the seven wide,
colored stairs around a pale floor, and the tall stone column in
the middle.</p>

<p>She dismounted and led her mare into the hollow, down
the stairs to the column. It loomed over her. She turned to look
back up at Rand and the others. The <em>grolm</em> gave their
grunting barks, scores of them, loud. Near. &ldquo;They will be on us
soon,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You must use the Stone, Rand. Or else find a way
to kill all the <em>grolm</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a sigh, Rand got down from his saddle and led
Red into the hollow. Loial and Hurin followed hastily. He stared at
the symbol-covered column, the Portal Stone, uneasily. <em>She must
be able to channel, even if she doesn&rsquo;t know it, or it couldn&rsquo;t
have brought her here. The Power doesn&rsquo;t harm women</em>. &ldquo;If this
brought you here,&rdquo; he began, but she interrupted him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what it is,&rdquo; she said firmly, &ldquo;but I do not
know how to use it. You must do what must be done.&rdquo; She traced one
symbol, a little larger than the others, with a finger. A triangle
standing on its point inside a circle. &ldquo;This stands for the true
world, our world. I believe it will help if you hold it in your
mind while you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She spread her hands as if unsure exactly
what it was he was supposed to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;my Lord?&rdquo; Hurin said diffidently. &ldquo;There
isn&rsquo;t much time.&rdquo; He glanced over his shoulder at the rim of the
hollow. The barking was louder. &ldquo;Those things will be here in
minutes, now.&rdquo; Loial nodded.</p>

<p>Drawing a deep breath, Rand put his hand on the
symbol Selene had pointed out. He looked at her to see if he was
doing it right, but she merely watched, not even the slightest
frown of worry wrinkling her pale forehead. <em>She&rsquo;s confident you
can save her. You have to</em>. The scent of her filled his
nostrils.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;my Lord?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand swallowed, and sought the void. It came easily,
springing up around him without effort. Emptiness. Emptiness except
for the light, wavering in a way that turned his stomach. Emptiness
except for <em>saidin</em>. But even the queasiness was distant. He
was one with the Portal Stone. The column felt smooth and slightly
oily under his hand, but the triangle-and-circle seemed warm
against the brand on his palm. <em>Have to get them to safety. Have
to get them home</em>. The light drifted toward him, it seemed,
surrounded him, and he&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;embraced&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Light filled him. Heat filled him. He could see
the Stone, see the others watching him&mdash;Loial and Hurin
anxiously, Selene showing no doubt that he could save her&mdash;but they might as well not have been there. The light was all. The
heat and the light, suffusing his limbs like water sinking into dry
sand, filling him. The symbol burned against his flesh. He tried to
suck it all in, all the heat, all the light. All. The symbol&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Suddenly, as if the sun had gone out for the blink of
an eye, the world flickered. And again. The symbol was a live coal
under his hand; he drank in the light. The world flickered.
Flickered. It made him sick, that light; it was water to a man
dying of thirst. Flicker. He sucked at it. It made him want to
vomit; he wanted it all. Flicker. The triangle-and-circle seared
him; he could feel it charring his hand. Flicker. He wanted it all!
He screamed, howling with pain, howling with wanting.</p>

<p>Flicker&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;flicker&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;flickerflickerflicker&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hands pulled at him; he was only vaguely aware of
them. He staggered back; the void was slipping away, the light, and
the sickness that twisted at him. The light. He watched it go
regretfully. <em>Light, that&rsquo;s crazy to want it. But I was so</em>
full <em>of it! I was so</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Dazed, he stared at Selene. It
was she who held his shoulders, stared wonderingly into his eyes.
He raised his hand in front of his face. The heron brand was there,
but nothing else. No triangle-and-circle burned into his flesh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remarkable,&rdquo; Selene said slowly. She glanced at
Loial and Hurin. The Ogier looked stunned, his eyes as big as
plates; the sniffer was squatting with one hand on the ground, as
if unsure he could support himself else. &ldquo;All of us here, and all
of our horses. And you do not even know what you did.
Remarkable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; Rand began hoarsely, and had to stop
to swallow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look around you,&rdquo; Selene said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve brought us
home.&rdquo; She gave a sudden laugh. &ldquo;You brought all of us home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the first time Rand became aware of his
surroundings again. The hollow surrounded them without any stairs,
through here and there lay a suspiciously smooth piece of stone,
colored red, or blue. The column lay against the mountainside, half
buried in the loose rock of a fall. The symbols were unclear, here;
wind and water had worked long on them. And everything looked real.
The colors were solid, the granite a strong gray, the brush green
and brown. After that other place, it seemed almost too vivid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Home,&rdquo; Rand breathed, and then he was laughing, too.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re home.&rdquo; Loial&rsquo;s laughter sounded like a bull bellowing. Hurin
danced a caper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did it,&rdquo; Selene said, leaning closer, until her
face filled Rand&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;I knew that you could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s laughter died. &ldquo;I&mdash;I suppose I did.&rdquo; He
glanced at the fallen Portal Stone and managed a weak laugh. &ldquo;I
wish I knew what it was I did, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Selene looked deep into his eyes. &ldquo;Perhaps one day
you will know,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;You are surely destined for great
things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes seemed as dark and deep as night, as soft as
velvet. Her mouth&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>If I kissed her</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He blinked
and stepped back hurriedly, clearing his throat. &ldquo;Selene, please
don&rsquo;t tell anyone about this. About the Portal Stone, and me. I
don&rsquo;t understand it, and neither will anybody else. You know how
people are about things they don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her face wore no expression at all. Suddenly he
wished very much that Mat and Perrin were there. Perrin knew how to
talk to girls, and Mat could lie with a straight face. He could
manage neither very well.</p>

<p>Suddenly Selene smiled, and dropped a half-mocking
curtsy. &ldquo;I will keep your secret, my Lord Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand glanced at her, and cleared his throat again.
<em>Is she angry with me? She&rsquo;d certainly be angry if I had tried
to kiss her. I think</em>. He wished she would not look at him as
she was, as if she knew what he was thinking. &ldquo;Hurin, is there any
chance the Darkfriends used this Stone before us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sniffer shook his head ruefully. &ldquo;They were
angling to the west of here, Lord Rand. Unless these Portal Stone
things are more common than I&rsquo;ve seen, I&rsquo;d say they&rsquo;re still in
that other world. But it wouldn&rsquo;t take me an hour to check it. The
land&rsquo;s the same here as there. I could find the place here where I
lost the trail there, if you see what I mean, and see if they&rsquo;ve
already gone by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand glanced at the sky. The sun&mdash;a wonderfully
strong sun, not pale at all&mdash;sat low to the west, stretching
their shadows out across the hollow. Another hour would bring full
twilight. &ldquo;In the morning,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I fear we&rsquo;ve lost them.&rdquo;
<em>We can&rsquo;t lose that dagger! We can&rsquo;t!</em> &ldquo;Selene, if that&rsquo;s
the case, in the morning we will take you on to your home. Is it in
the city of Cairhien itself, or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may not have lost the Horn of Valere yet,&rdquo;
Selene said slowly. &ldquo;As you know, I do know a <em>few</em> things
about those worlds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Mirrors of the Wheel</em>,&rdquo; Loial said.</p>

<p>She gave him a look, then nodded. &ldquo;Yes. Exactly.
Those worlds truly are mirrors in a way, especially the ones where
there are no people. Some of them reflect only great events in the
true world, but some have a shadow of that reflection even before
the event occurs. The passage of the Horn of Valere would certainly
be a great event. Reflections of what will be are fainter than
reflections of what is or what was, just as Hurin says the trail he
followed was faint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hurin blinked incredulously. &ldquo;You mean to say, my
Lady, I&rsquo;ve been smelling where those Darkfriends are <em>going</em>
to be? The Light help me, I wouldn&rsquo;t like that. It&rsquo;s bad enough
smelling where violence <em>has</em> been, with out smelling where
it <em>will</em> be, too. There can&rsquo;t be many spots where there
won&rsquo;t be <em>some</em> kind of violence, <em>some</em> time. It
would drive me crazy, like as not. That place we just left nearly
did. I could smell it all the time, there, killing and hurting, and
the vilest evil you could think of. I could even smell it on us. On
all of us. Even on you, my Lady, if you&rsquo;ll forgive me for saying
so. It was just that place, twisting me the way it twisted your
eye.&rdquo; He gave himself a shake. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;re out of there. I
can&rsquo;t get it out of my nostrils yet, all the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand rubbed absently at the brand on his palm. &ldquo;What
do you think, Loial? Could we really be ahead of Fain&rsquo;s
Darkfriends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Ogier shrugged, frowning. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Rand. I
don&rsquo;t know anything about any of this. I think we are back in our
world. I think we are in Kinslayer&rsquo;s Dagger. Beyond that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He
shrugged again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We should be seeing you home, Selene,&rdquo; Rand said.
&ldquo;Your people will be worried about you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A few days will see if I&rsquo;m right,&rdquo; she said
impatiently. &ldquo;Hurin can find where he left the trail; he said so.
We can watch over it. The Horn of Valere cannot be much longer
reaching here. The Horn of Valere, Rand. Think of it. The man who
sounds the Horn will live in legend forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want anything to do with legends,&rdquo; he said
sharply. <em>But if the Darkfriends get by you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;What if Ingtar
lost them? Then the Darkfriends have the Horn of Valere forever,
and Mat dies</em>. &ldquo;All right, a few days. At the worst, we will
probably meet Ingtar and the others. I can&rsquo;t imagine they&rsquo;ve
stopped or turned back just because we&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;went away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A wise decision, Rand,&rdquo; Selene said, &ldquo;and well
thought out.&rdquo; She touched his arm and smiled, and he found himself
again thinking of kissing her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;we need to be closer to where they&rsquo;ll come.
If they do come. Hurin, can you find us a camp before dark,
somewhere we can watch the place where you lost the trail?&rdquo; He
glanced at the Portal Stone and thought about sleeping near it,
thought of the way the void had crept up on him in sleep the last
time, and the light in the void. &ldquo;Somewhere well away from
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave it in my hands, Lord Rand.&rdquo; The sniffer
scrambled to his saddle. &ldquo;I vow, I&rsquo;ll never sleep again without
first I see what kind of stone there is nearby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Rand rode Red up out of the hollow, he found
himself watching Selene more than he did Hurin. She seemed so cool
and self-possessed, no older than he, yet queenly, but when she
smiled at him, as she did just then&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Egwene wouldn&rsquo;t have
said I was wise. Egwene would have called me a woolhead</em>.
Irritably, he heeled Red&rsquo;s flanks.</p>
