<h4><em>Disagreements</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>hunder rumbled across the slate-dark afternoon sky.
Rand pulled the hood of his cloak further up, hoping to keep at
least some of the cold rain off. Red stepped through muddy puddles
doggedly. The hood hung sodden around Rand&rsquo;s head, as the rest of
the cloak did around his shoulders, and his fine black coat was
just as wet, and as cold. The temperature would not have far to
drop before snow or sleet came down instead of rain. Snow would
fall soon, again; the people in the village they had passed through
said two snows had already come this year. Shivering, Rand almost
wished it was snowing. Then, at least, he would not be soaked to
the skin.</p>

<p>The column plodded along, keeping a wary eye on the
rolling country. Ingtar&rsquo;s Gray Owl hung heavily even when the wind
gusted. Hurin sometimes pulled his cowl back to sniff the air; he
said neither rain nor cold had any effect on a trail, certainly not
on the kind of trail he was seeking, but so far the sniffer had
found nothing. Behind him, Rand heard Uno mutter a curse. Loial
kept checking his saddlebags; he did not seem to mind getting wet
himself, but he worried continually about his books. Everyone was
miserable except for Verin, who appeared too lost in thought to
even notice that her hood had slid back, exposing her face to the
rain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you do something about this?&rdquo; Rand demanded of
her. A small voice in the back of his head told him he could do it
himself. All he need do was embrace <em>saidin</em>. So sweet, the
call of <em>saidin</em>. To be filled with the One Power, to be one
with the storm. Turn the skies to sunlight, or ride the storm as it
raged, whip it to fury and scour Toman Head clean from the sea to
the plain. Embrace <em>saidin</em>. He suppressed the longing
ruthlessly.</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai gave a start. &ldquo;What? Oh. I suppose. A
little. I couldn&rsquo;t stop a storm this big, not by myself&mdash;it
covers too much area&mdash;but I could lessen it some. Where we
are, at least.&rdquo; She wiped rain from her face, seemed to realize for
the first time that her hood had slipped, and pulled it back up
absently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Mat said. The shivering face
peering out from under his hood looked at death&rsquo;s door, but his
voice was vigorous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because if I used that much of the One Power, any
Aes Sedai closer than ten miles would know someone had channeled.
We don&rsquo;t want to bring these Seanchan down on us with some of their
<em>damane</em>.&rdquo; Her mouth tightened angrily.</p>

<p>They had learned a little of the invaders in that
village, called Atuan&rsquo;s Mill, though most of what they had heard
hatched more questions than it answered. The people had babbled one
moment and clamped their mouths shut the next, trembling and
looking over their shoulders. They all shook with fear that the
Seanchan would return with their monsters and their <em>
damane</em>. That women who should have been Aes Sedai were instead
leashed like animals frightened the villagers even more than the
strange creatures the Seanchan commanded, things the folk of
Atuan&rsquo;s Mill could only describe in whispers as coming from
nightmares. And worst of all, the examples the Seanchan had made
before leaving still chilled the people to their marrow. They had
buried their dead, but they feared to clean away the large charred
patch in the village square. None of them would say what had
happened there, but Hurin had vomited as soon as they entered the
village, and he would not go near the blackened ground.</p>

<p>Atuan&rsquo;s Mill had been half deserted. Some had fled to
Falme, thinking the Seanchan would not be so harsh in a town they
held fast, and others had gone east. More had said they were
thinking of it. There was fighting on Almoth Plain, Taraboners
battling Domani it was said, but such houses and barns as were
burned there were kindled by torches in the hands of men. Even a
war was easier to face than what the Seanchan had done, what they
might do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did Fain bring the Horn here?&rdquo; Perrin muttered.
The question had been asked by each of them at one time or another,
and no one had an answer. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s war, and these Seanchan, and
their monsters. Why here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ingtar turned in his saddle to look back at them. His
face appeared almost as haggard as Mat&rsquo;s. &ldquo;There are always men who
see chances for their own advantage in the confusion of war. Fain
is one like that. No doubt he thinks to steal the Horn again, from
the Dark One this time, and use it for his own profit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Father of Lies never lays simple plans,&rdquo; Verin
said. &ldquo;It may be that he wants Fain to bring the Horn here for some
reason known only in Shayol Ghul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsters,&rdquo; Mat snorted. His cheeks were sunken, now,
his eyes hollow. That he <em>sounded</em> healthy only made it
worse. &ldquo;They saw some Trollocs, or a Fade, if you ask me. Well, why
not? If the Seanchan have Aes Sedai fighting for them, why not
Fades and Trollocs?&rdquo; He caught Verin staring at him and flinched.
&ldquo;Well, they are, on leashes or not. They can channel, and that
makes them Aes Sedai.&rdquo; He glanced at Rand and gave a ragged laugh.
&ldquo;That makes you Aes Sedai, the Light help us all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Masema came galloping from ahead, through the mud and
the steady rain. &ldquo;There is another village ahead, my Lord,&rdquo; he said
as he pulled in beside Ingtar. His eyes only swept past Rand, but
they tightened, and he did not look at Rand again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s empty, my
Lord. No villagers, no Seanchan, nobody at all. The houses all look
sound, though, except for two or three that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well, they aren&rsquo;t
there anymore, my Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ingtar raised his hand and signaled for a trot.</p>

<p>The village Masema had found covered the slopes of a
hill, with a paved square at the top around a circle of stone
walls. The houses were of stone, all flat-roofed and few more than
a single story. Three that had been larger, along one side of the
square, were only heaps of blackened rubble; shattered chunks of
stone and roof beams lay scattered across the square. A few
shutters banged when the wind gusted.</p>

<p>Ingtar dismounted in front of the only large building
still standing. The creaking sign above its door bore a woman
juggling stars, but no name; rain came off the corners in two
steady drizzles. Verin hurried inside while Ingtar spoke. &ldquo;Uno,
search every house. If there is anyone left, perhaps they can tell
us what happened here, and maybe a little more about these
Seanchan. And if there&rsquo;s any food, bring that, too. And blankets.&rdquo;
Uno nodded and began telling off men. Ingtar turned to Hurin. &ldquo;What
do you smell? Did Fain come through here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hurin, rubbing his nose, shook his head. &ldquo;Not him, my
Lord, and not the Trollocs, neither. Whoever did that left a
stench, though.&rdquo; He pointed to the wreckage that had been houses.
&ldquo;It was killing, my Lord. There were people in there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seanchan,&rdquo; Ingtar growled. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get inside. Ragan,
find some sort of stable for the horses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verin already had fires going in both of the big
fireplaces, at either end of the common room, and was warming her
hands at one, her sodden cloak spread out on one of the tables
dotting the tiled floor. She had found a few candles, too, now
burning on a table stuck in their own tallow. Emptiness and quiet,
except for the occasional grumble of thunder, added to the
flickering shadows to give the place a cavernous feel. Rand tossed
his equally wet cloak and coat on a table and joined her. Only
Loial seemed more interested in checking his books than in warming
himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will never find the Horn of Valere this way,&rdquo;
Ingtar said. &ldquo;Three days since we&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;since we arrived here&rdquo;&mdash;he shuddered and scrubbed a hand through his hair; Rand
wondered what the Shienaran had seen in his other lives&mdash;&ldquo;another two, at least, to Falme, and we have not found so much as
a hair of Fain or Darkfriends. There are scores of villages along
the coast. He could have gone to any of them and taken ship
anywhere by now. If he was ever here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is here,&rdquo; Verin said calmly, &ldquo;and he went to
Falme.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s still here,&rdquo; Rand said. <em>Waiting for me.
Please, Light, he&rsquo;s still waiting</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurin still hasn&rsquo;t caught a whiff of him,&rdquo; Ingtar
said. The sniffer shrugged as if he felt himself at fault for the
failure. &ldquo;Why would he choose Falme? If those villagers are to be
believed, Falme is held by these Seanchan. I would give my best
hound to know who they are, and where they came from.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who they are is not important to us.&rdquo; Verin knelt
and unfastened her saddlebags, pulling out dry clothes. &ldquo;At least
we have rooms in which to change our clothes, though it will do us
little good unless the weather changes. Ingtar, it may well be that
what the villagers told us is right, that they are the descendants
of Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s armies come back. What matters is that Padan
Fain has gone to Falme. The writings in the dungeon at Fal Dara&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;never mentioned Fain. Forgive me, Aes Sedai,
but that could have been a trick as easily as dark prophecy. I
can&rsquo;t believe even Trollocs would be stupid enough to tell us
everything they were going to do before they did it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She twisted to look up at him. &ldquo;And what do you mean
to do, if you will not take my advice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean to have the Horn of Valere,&rdquo; Ingtar said
firmly. &ldquo;Forgive me, but I have to trust my own senses before some
words scrawled by a Trolloc&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Myrddraal, surely,&rdquo; Verin murmured, but he did not
even pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;or a Darkfriend seeming to betray himself out
of his own mouth. I mean to quarter the ground until Hurin smells a
trail or we find Fain in the flesh. I must have the Horn, Verin
Sedai. I must!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t the way,&rdquo; Hurin said softly. &ldquo;Not &lsquo;must.&rsquo;
What happens, happens.&rdquo; No one paid him any mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We all must,&rdquo; Verin murmured, peering into her
saddlebags, &ldquo;yet some things may be even more important than
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not say more, but Rand grimaced. He longed to
get away from her and her prods and hints. <em>I am not the Dragon
Reborn. Light, but I wish I could just get away from Aes Sedai
completely</em>. &ldquo;Ingtar, I think I&rsquo;m riding on to Falme. Fain is
there&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure he is&mdash;and if I don&rsquo;t come soon, he&mdash;he will do something to hurt Emond&rsquo;s Field.&rdquo; He had not
mentioned that part before.</p>

<p>They all stared at him, Mat and Perrin frowning,
worried but considering; Verin as if she had just seen a new piece
added to a puzzle. Loial looked astonished, and Hurin seemed
confused. Ingtar was openly disbelieving.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why would he do that?&rdquo; the Shienaran said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Rand lied, &ldquo;but that was part of the
message he left with Barthanes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did Barthanes say Fain was going to Falme?&rdquo;
Ingtar demanded. &ldquo;No. It wouldn&rsquo;t matter if he had.&rdquo; He gave a
bitter laugh. &ldquo;Darkfriends lie as naturally as they breathe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand,&rdquo; Mat said, &ldquo;if I knew how to stop Fain from
hurting Emond&rsquo;s Field, I would. If I was sure he was going to. But
I need that dagger, Rand, and Hurin has the best chance of finding
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go wherever you go, Rand,&rdquo; Loial said. He had
finished making sure the books were dry and was taking off his
sodden coat. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see where a few more days will change
anything one way or another, now. Try being a little less hasty for
once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter to me whether we go to Falme now,
later, or never,&rdquo; Perrin said with a shrug, &ldquo;but if Fain really is
threatening Emond&rsquo;s Field&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well, Mat&rsquo;s right. Hurin is the
best way to find him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can find him, Lord Rand,&rdquo; Hurin put in. &ldquo;Let me
get one sniff of him, and I&rsquo;ll take you right to him. There&rsquo;s never
anything else left a trail like his.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must make your own choice, Rand,&rdquo; Verin said
carefully, &ldquo;but remember that Falme is held by invaders about whom
we still know next to nothing. If you go to Falme alone, you may
find yourself a prisoner, or worse, and that will serve nothing. I
am sure whatever choice you make will be the right one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Ta&rsquo;veren</em>,&rdquo; Loial rumbled.</p>

<p>Rand threw up his hands.</p>

<p>Uno came in from the square, shaking rain off his
cloak. &ldquo;Not a flaming soul to be found, my Lord. Looks to me like
they ran like striped pigs. Livestock&rsquo;s all gone, and there isn&rsquo;t a
bloody cart or wagon left, either. Half the houses are stripped to
the flaming floors. I&rsquo;ll wager my next month&rsquo;s pay you could follow
them by the bloody furniture they tossed on the side of the road
when they realized it was only weighing down their flaming
wagons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about clothes?&rdquo; Ingtar asked.</p>

<p>Uno blinked his one eye in surprise. &ldquo;Just a few bits
and pieces, my Lord. Mainly what they didn&rsquo;t think was bloody worth
taking with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will have to do. Hurin, I mean to dress you and
a few more as local people, as many as we can manage, so you won&rsquo;t
stand out. I want you to swing wide, north and south, until you
cross the trail.&rdquo; More soldiers were coming in, and they all
gathered around Ingtar and Hurin to listen.</p>

<p>Rand leaned his hands on the mantel over the
fireplace and stared into the flames. They made him think of
Ba&rsquo;alzamon&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I feel&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;something&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;pulling me to Falme, and there isn&rsquo;t much time.&rdquo; He
saw Verin watching him, and added harshly, &ldquo;Not that. It&rsquo;s Fain I
have to find. It has nothing to do with&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verin nodded. &ldquo;The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills,
and we are all woven into the Pattern. Fain has been here weeks
before us, perhaps months. A few more days will make little
difference in whatever is going to happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get some sleep,&rdquo; he muttered, picking
up his saddlebags. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t have carried off all the beds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upstairs, he did find beds, but only a few still had
mattresses, and those so lumpy he thought it might be more
comfortable to sleep on the floor. Finally he chose a bed where the
mattress simply sagged in the middle. There was nothing else in the
room except one wooden chair and a table with a rickety leg.</p>

<p>He took off his wet things, putting on a dry shirt
and breeches before lying down, since there were no sheets or
blankets, and propped his sword beside the head of the bed. Wryly,
he thought that the only thing dry he had for a coverlet was the
Dragon&rsquo;s banner; he left it safely buckled inside the
saddlebags.</p>

<p>Rain drummed on the roof, and thunder growled
overhead, and now and again a lightning flash lit the windows.
Shivering, he rolled this way and that on the mattress, seeking
some comfortable way to lie, wondering if the banner would not do
for a blanket after all, wondering if he should ride on to
Falme.</p>

<p>He rolled to his other side, and Ba&rsquo;alzamon was
standing beside the chair with the pure white length of the
Dragon&rsquo;s banner in his hands. The room seemed darker there, as if
Ba&rsquo;alzamon stood on the edge of a cloud of oily black smoke. Nearly
healed burns crisscrossed his face, and as Rand looked, his
pitch-dark eyes vanished for an instant, replaced by endless
caverns of fire. Rand&rsquo;s saddlebags lay by his feet, buckles undone,
flap thrown back where the banner had been hidden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The time comes closer, Lews Therin. A thousand
threads draw tight, and soon you will be tied and trapped, set to a
course you cannot change. Madness. Death. Before you die, will you
once more kill everything you love?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand glanced at the door, but he made no move except
to sit up on the side of the bed. What good to try running from the
Dark One? His throat felt like sand. &ldquo;I am not the Dragon, Father
of Lies!&rdquo; he said hoarsely.</p>

<p>The darkness behind Ba&rsquo;alzamon roiled, and furnaces
roared as Ba&rsquo;alzamon laughed. &ldquo;You honor me. And belittle yourself.
I know you too well. I have faced you a thousand times. A thousand
times a thousand. I know you to your miserable soul, Lews Therin
Kinslayer.&rdquo; He laughed again; Rand put a hand in front of his face
against the heat of that fiery mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want? I will not serve you. I will not
do anything that you want. I&rsquo;ll die first!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You <em>will</em> die, worm! How many times have you
died across the span of the Ages, fool, and how much has death
availed you? The grave is cold and lonely, save for the worms. The
grave is mine. This time there will be no rebirth for you. This
time the Wheel of Time will be broken and the world remade in the
image of the Shadow. This time your death will be forever! Which
will you choose? Death everlasting? Or life eternal&mdash;and
power!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand hardly realized that he was on his feet. The
void had surrounded him, <em>saidin</em> was there, and the One
Power flowed into him. That fact almost cracked the emptiness. Was
this real? Was it a dream? Could he channel in a dream? But the
torrent rushing into him swept away his doubts. He hurled it at
Ba&rsquo;alzamon, hurled the pure One Power, the force that turned the
Wheel of Time, a force that could make seas burn and eat
mountains.</p>

<p>Ba&rsquo;alzamon took half a step back, holding the banner
clutched before him. Flames leaped in his wide eyes and mouth, and
the darkness seemed to cloak him in shadow. In the Shadow. The
Power sank into that black mist and vanished, soaked up like water
on parched sand.</p>

<p>Rand drew on <em>saidin</em>, pulled for more, and
still more. His flesh seemed so cold it must shatter at a touch; it
burned as if it must boil away. His bones felt on the point of
crisping to cold crystal ash. He did not care; it was like drinking
life itself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; Ba&rsquo;alzamon roared. &ldquo;You will destroy
yourself!&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Mat</em>. The thought floated somewhere beyond
the consuming flood. <em>The dagger. The Horn. Fain. Emond&rsquo;s Field.
I can&rsquo;t die yet</em>.</p>

<p>He was not sure how he did it, but suddenly the Power
was gone, and <em>saidin</em>, and the void. Shuddering
uncontrollably, he fell to his knees beside the bed, arms wrapped
around himself in a vain effort to stop their twitching.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is better, Lews Therin.&rdquo; Ba&rsquo;alzamon tossed the
banner to the floor and put his hands on the chair back; wisps of
smoke rose from between his fingers. The shadow no longer
encompassed him. &ldquo;There is your banner, Kinslayer. Much good will
it do you. A thousand strings laid over a thousand years have drawn
you here. Ten thousand woven throughout the Ages tie you like a
sheep for slaughter. The Wheel itself holds you prisoner to your
fate Age after Age. But I can set you free. You cowering cur, I
alone in the entire world can teach you how to wield the Power. I
alone can stop it killing you before you have a chance to go mad. I
alone can stop the madness. You have served me before. Serve me
again, Lews Therin, or be destroyed forever!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name,&rdquo; Rand forced between chattering teeth, &ldquo;is
Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo; His shivering forced him to squeeze his eyes shut,
and when he opened them again, he was alone.</p>

<p>Ba&rsquo;alzamon was gone. The shadow was gone. His
saddlebags stood against the chair with the buckles done up and one
side bulging with the bulk of the Dragon&rsquo;s banner, just as he had
left it. But on the chair back, tendrils of smoke still rose from
the charred impressions of fingers.</p>
