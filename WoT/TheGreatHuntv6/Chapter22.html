<h4><em>Watchers</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">N</span>othing
is happening as I expect,&rdquo; Moiraine muttered,
not expecting an answer from Lan.</p>

<p>The long, polished table before her was littered with
books and papers, scrolls and manuscripts, many of them dusty from
long storage and tattered with age, some only fragments. The room
seemed almost made of books and manuscripts, filling shelves except
where there were doors or windows or the fireplace. The chairs were
high-backed and well padded, but half of them, and most of the
small tables, held books, and some had books and scrolls tucked
under them. Only the clutter in front of Moiraine was hers,
though.</p>

<p>She rose and moved to the window, peered into the
night toward the lights of the village, not far off. No danger of
pursuit here. No one would expect her to come here. <em>Clear my
head, and begin again</em>, she thought. <em>That is all there is to
do</em>.</p>

<p>None of the villagers had any suspicion that the two
elderly sisters living in this snug house were Aes Sedai. One did
not suspect such things in a small place like Tifan&rsquo;s Well, a
farming community deep in the grassy plains of Arafel. The
villagers came to the sisters for advice on their problems and
cures for their ills, and valued them as women blessed by the
Light, but no more. Adeleas and Vandene had gone into voluntary
retreat together so long ago that few even in the White Tower
remembered they still lived.</p>

<p>With the one equally aged Warder who remained to
them, they lived quietly, still intending to write the history of
the world since the Breaking, and as much as they could include of
before. One day. In the meantime, there was so much information to
gather, so many puzzles to solve. Their house was the perfect place
for Moiraine to find the information she needed. Except that it was
not there.</p>

<p>Movement caught her eye, and she turned. Lan was
lounging against the yellow brick fireplace, as imperturbable as a
boulder. &ldquo;Do you remember the first time we met, Lan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was watching for some sign, or she would not have
seen the quick twitch of his eyebrow. It was not often she caught
him by surprise. This was a subject neither of them ever mentioned;
nearly twenty years ago she had told him&mdash;with all the stiff
pride of one still young enough to be called young, she recalled&mdash;that she would never speak of it again and expected the same
silence of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; was all he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And still no apology, I suppose? You threw me into a
pond.&rdquo; She did not smile, though she could feel amusement at it,
now. &ldquo;Every stitch I had was soaked, and in what you Bordermen call
new spring. I nearly froze.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I recall I built a fire, too, and hung blankets so
you could warm yourself in privacy.&rdquo; He poked at the burning logs
and returned the firetool to its hook. Even summer nights were cool
in the Borderlands. &ldquo;I also recall that while I slept that night,
you dumped half the pond on me. It would have saved a great deal of
shivering on both our parts if you had simply told me you were Aes
Sedai rather than demonstrating it. Rather than trying to separate
me from my sword. Not a good way to introduce yourself to a
Borderman, even for a young woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>was</em> young, and alone, and you were as
large then as you are now, and your fierceness more open. I did not
want you to know I was Aes Sedai. It seemed to me at the time you
might answer my questions more freely if you did not know.&rdquo; She
fell silent for a moment, thinking of the years since that meeting.
It had been good to find a companion to join her in her quest. &ldquo;In
the weeks that followed, did you suspect that I would ask you to
bond to me? I decided you were the one in the first day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never guessed,&rdquo; he said dryly. &ldquo;I was too busy
wondering if I could escort you to Chachin and keep a whole skin. A
different surprise you had for me every night. The ants I recall in
particular. I don&rsquo;t think I had one good night&rsquo;s sleep that whole
ride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She permitted herself a small smile, remembering. &ldquo;I
was young,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;And does your bond chafe after all these
years? You are not a man to wear a leash easily, even so light a
one as mine.&rdquo; It was a stinging comment; she meant it to be so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; His voice was cool, but he took up the firetool
again and gave the blaze a fierce poking it did not need. Sparks
cascaded up the chimney. &ldquo;I chose freely, knowing what it
entailed.&rdquo; The iron rod clattered back onto its hook, and he made a
formal bow. &ldquo;Honor to serve, Moiraine Aes Sedai. It has been and
will be so, always.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine sniffed. &ldquo;Your humility, Lan Gaidin, has
always been more arrogance than most kings could manage with their
armies at their backs. From the first day I met you, it has been
so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why all this talk of days past, Moiraine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the hundredth time&mdash;or so it seemed to her&mdash;she considered the words to use. &ldquo;Before we left Tar Valon I
made arrangements, should anything happen to me, for your bond to
pass to another.&rdquo; He stared at her, silent. &ldquo;When you feel my
death, you will find yourself compelled to seek her out
immediately. I do not want you to be surprised by it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Compelled,&rdquo; he breathed softly, angrily. &ldquo;Never once
have you used my bond to compel me. I thought you more than
disapproved of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had I left this thing undone, you would be free of
the bond at my death, and not even my strongest command to you
would hold. I will not allow you to die in a useless attempt to
avenge me. And I will not allow you to return to your equally
useless private war in the Blight. The war we fight is the same
war, if you could only see it so, and I will see that you fight it
to some purpose. Neither vengeance nor an unburied death in the
Blight will do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do you foresee your death coming soon?&rdquo; His
voice was quiet, his face expressionless, both like stone in a dead
winter blizzard. It was a manner she had seen in him many times,
usually when he was on the point of violence. &ldquo;Have you planned
something, without me, that will see you dead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am suddenly glad there is no pond in this room,&rdquo;
she murmured, then raised her hands when he stiffened, offended at
her light tone. &ldquo;I see my death in every day, as you do. How could
I not, with the task we have followed these years? Now, with
everything coming to a head, I must see it as even more
possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment he studied his hands, large and square.
&ldquo;I had never thought,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;that I might not be the
first of us to die. Somehow, even at the worst, it always seemed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Abruptly he scrubbed his hands against each other. &ldquo;If there
is a chance I might be given like a pet lapdog, I would at least
like to know to whom I am being given.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never seen you as a pet,&rdquo; Moiraine said
sharply, &ldquo;and neither does Myrelle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Myrelle.&rdquo; He grimaced. &ldquo;Yes, she would have to be
Green, or else some slip of a girl just raised to full
sisterhood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Myrelle can keep her three Gaidin in line,
perhaps she has a chance to manage you. Though she would like to
keep you, I know, she has promised to pass your bond to another
when she finds one who suits you better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So. Not a pet but a parcel. Myrelle is to be a&mdash;a caretaker! Moiraine, not even the Greens treat their
Warders so. No Aes Sedai has passed her Warder&rsquo;s bond to another in
four hundred years, but you intend to do it to me not once, but
twice!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is done, and I will not undo it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light blind me, if I am to be passed from hand
to hand, do you at least have some idea in whose hand I will
end?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I do is for your own good, and perhaps it may
be for another&rsquo;s, as well. It may be that Myrelle will find a slip
of a girl just raised to sisterhood&mdash;was that not what you
said?&mdash;who needs a Warder hardened in battle and wise in the
ways of the world, a slip of a girl who may need someone who will
throw her into a pond. You have much to offer, Lan, and to see it
wasted in an unmarked grave, or left to the ravens, when it could
go to a woman who needs it would be worse than the sin of which the
Whitecloaks prate. Yes, I think she will have need of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan&rsquo;s eyes widened slightly; for him it was the same
as another man gasping in shocked surmise. She had seldom seen him
so off balance. He opened his mouth twice before he spoke. &ldquo;And who
do you have in mind for this&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She cut him off. &ldquo;Are you sure the bond does not
chafe, Lan Gaidin? Do you realize for the first time, only now, the
strength of that bond, the depth of it? You could end with some
budding White, all logic and no heart, or with a young Brown who
sees you as nothing more than a pair of hands to carry her books
and sketches. I can hand you where I will, like a parcel&mdash;or
a lapdog&mdash;and you can do no more than go. Are you sure it
does not chafe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that what this has been for?&rdquo; he grated. His eyes
burned like blue fire, and his mouth twisted. Anger; for the first
time ever that she had seen, open anger etched his face. &ldquo;Has all
this talk been a test&mdash;a test!&mdash;to see if you
could make my bond rub? After all this time? From the day I pledged
to you, I have ridden where you said ride, even when I thought it
foolish, even when I had reason to ride another way. Never did you
need my bond to force me. On your word I have watched you walk into
danger and kept my hands at my sides when I wanted nothing more
than to out sword and carve a path to safety for you. After this,
you test me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a test, Lan. I spoke plainly, not twisting, and
I have done as I said. But at Fal Dara, I began to wonder if you
were still wholly with me.&rdquo; A wariness entered his eyes. <em>Lan,
forgive me. I would not have cracked the walls you hold so hard,
but I must know</em>. &ldquo;Why did you do as you did with Rand?&rdquo; He
blinked; it was obviously not what he expected. She knew what he
had thought was coming, and she would not let up now that he was
off balance. &ldquo;You brought him to the Amyrlin speaking and acting as
a Border lord and a soldier born. It fit, in a way, with what I
planned for him, but you and I never spoke of teaching him any of
that. Why, Lan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seemed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;right. A young wolfhound must meet
his first wolf someday, but if the wolf sees him as a puppy, if he
acts the puppy, the wolf will surely kill him. The wolfhound must
be a wolfhound in the wolf&rsquo;s eyes even more than in his own, if he
is to survive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that how you see Aes Sedai? The Amyrlin? Me?
Wolves out to pull down your young wolfhound?&rdquo; Lan shook his head.
&ldquo;You know what he is, Lan. You know what he must become. Must. What
I have worked for since the day you and I met, and before. Do you
now doubt what I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. No, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He was recovering himself,
building his walls again. But they were not rebuilt yet. &ldquo;How many
times have you said that <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> pull those around them
like twigs in a whirlpool? Perhaps I was pulled, too. I only know
that it felt right. Those farm folk needed someone on their side.
Rand did, at least. Moiraine, I believe in what you do, even as
now, when I know not half of it; believe as I believe in you. I
have not asked to be released from my bond, nor will I. Whatever
your plans for dying and seeing me safely&mdash;disposed of&mdash;I will take great pleasure in keeping you alive and seeing those
plans, at least, go for nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Ta&rsquo;veren</em>,&rdquo; Moiraine sighed. &ldquo;Perhaps it was
that. Rather than guiding a chip floating down a stream, I am
trying to guide a log through rapids. Every time I push at it, it
pushes at me, and the log grows larger the farther we go. Yet I
must see it through to the end.&rdquo; She gave a little laugh. &ldquo;I will
not be unhappy, my old friend, if you manage to put those plans
awry. Now, please leave me. I need to be alone to think.&rdquo; He
hesitated only a moment before turning for the door. At the last
moment, though, she could not let him go without one more question.
&ldquo;Do you ever dream of something different, Lan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All men dream. But I know dreams for dreams. This&rdquo;&mdash;he touched his sword hilt&mdash;&ldquo;is reality.&rdquo; The walls
were back, as high and hard as ever.</p>

<p>For a time after he left, Moiraine leaned back in her
chair, looking into the fire. She thought of Nynaeve and cracks in
a wall. Without trying, without thinking what she was doing, that
young woman had put cracks in Lan&rsquo;s walls and seeded the cracks
with creepers. Lan thought he was secure, imprisoned in his
fortress by fate and his own wishes, but slowly, patiently, the
creepers were tearing down the walls to bare the man within.
Already he was sharing some of Nynaeve&rsquo;s loyalties; in the
beginning he had been indifferent to the Emond&rsquo;s Field folk, except
as people in whom Moiraine had some interest. Nynaeve had changed
that as she had changed Lan.</p>

<p>To her surprise, Moiraine felt a flash of jealousy.
She had never felt that before, certainly not for any of the women
who had thrown their hearts at his feet, or those who had shared
his bed. Indeed, she had never thought of him as an object of
jealousy, had never thought so of any man. She was married to her
battle, as he was married to his. But they had been companions in
those battles for so long. He had ridden a horse to death, then run
himself nearly to death, carrying her in his arms at the last, to
Anaiya for Healing. She had tended his wounds more than once,
keeping with her arts a life he had been ready to throw away to
save hers. He had always said he was wedded with death. Now a new
bride had captured his eyes, though he was blind to it. He thought
he still stood strong behind his walls, but Nynaeve had laced
bridal flowers in his hair. Would he still find himself able to
court death so blithely? Moiraine wondered when he would ask her to
release him from his bond. And what she would do when he did.</p>

<p>With a grimace, she got to her feet. There were more
important matters. Far more important. Her eyes ran over the open
books and papers crowding the room. So many hints, but no
answers.</p>

<p>Vandene came in with a teapot and cups on a tray. She
was slender and graceful, with a straight back, and the hair
gathered neatly at the nape of her neck was almost white. The
agelessness of her smooth face was that of long, long years. &ldquo;I
would have had Jaem bring this, and not disturb you myself, but
he&rsquo;s out in the barn practicing with his sword.&rdquo; She made a
clucking sound as she pushed a battered manuscript aside to set the
tray on the table. &ldquo;Lan being here has him remembering he&rsquo;s more
than a gardener and handyman. Gaidin are so stiff-necked. I thought
Lan would still be here; that&rsquo;s why I brought an extra cup. Have
you found what you were seeking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not even sure what it is I am seeking.&rdquo;
Moiraine frowned, studying the other woman. Vandene was of the
Green Ajah, not Brown like her sister, yet the two of them had
studied so long together that she knew as much of history as
Adeleas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever it is, you don&rsquo;t even seem to know where to
look.&rdquo; Vandene shifted some of the books and manuscripts on the
table, shaking her head. &ldquo;So many subjects. The Trolloc Wars. The
Watchers Over the Waves. The legend of the Return. Two treatises on
the Horn of Valere. Three on dark prophecy, and&mdash;Light,
here&rsquo;s Santhra&rsquo;s book on the Forsaken. Nasty, that. As nasty as
this on Shadar Logoth. And the Prophecies of the Dragon, in three
translations <em>and</em> the original. Moiraine, whatever <em>
are</em> you after? The Prophecies, I can understand&mdash;we hear
some news here, remote as we are. We hear some of what&rsquo;s happening
in Illian. There&rsquo;s even a rumor in the village that someone has
already found the Horn.&rdquo; She gestured with a manuscript on the
Horn, and coughed in the dust that rose from it. &ldquo;I discount that,
of course. There would be rumors. But what&mdash;? No. You said you
wanted privacy, and I&rsquo;ll give it to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop a moment,&rdquo; Moiraine said, halting the other Aes
Sedai short of the door. &ldquo;Perhaps you can answer some questions for
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will try.&rdquo; Vandene smiled suddenly. &ldquo;Adeleas
claims I should have chosen Brown. Ask.&rdquo; She poured two cups of tea
and handed one to Moiraine, then took a chair by the fire.</p>

<p>Steam curled over the cups while Moiraine chose her
questions carefully. <em>To find the answers, and not reveal too
much</em>. &ldquo;The Horn of Valere is not mentioned in the Prophecies,
but is it linked to the Dragon anywhere?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Except for the fact that the Horn must be found
before Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don and that the Dragon Reborn is supposed to
fight the Last Battle, there is no link between them at all.&rdquo; The
white-haired woman sipped her tea and waited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does anything link the Dragon with Toman Head?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vandene hesitated. &ldquo;Yes, and no. This is a bone
between Adeleas and me.&rdquo; Her voice took on a lecturing tone, and
for a time she did sound like a Brown. &ldquo;There is a verse in the
original that translates literally as &lsquo;Five ride forth, and four
return. Above the watchers shall he proclaim himself, bannered
cross the sky in fire&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rsquo; Well, it goes on. The point is, the
word <em>ma&rsquo;vron</em>. I say it should be translated not simply as
&lsquo;watchers,&rsquo; which is <em>a&rsquo;vron</em>. <em>Ma&rsquo;vron</em> has more
importance to it. I say it means the Watchers Over the Waves,
though they call themselves <em>Do Miere A&rsquo;vron</em>, of course,
not <em>Ma&rsquo;vron</em>. Adeleas tells me I am quibbling. But I
believe it means the Dragon Reborn will appear somewhere above
Toman Head, in Arad Doman, or Saldaea. Adeleas may think I&rsquo;m
foolish, but I listen to every scrap I hear coming from Saldaea
these days. Mazrim Taim can channel, so I hear, and our sisters
haven&rsquo;t managed to corner him yet. If the Dragon is Reborn, and the
Horn of Valere found, then the Last Battle is coming soon. We may
never finish our history.&rdquo; She gave a shiver, then abruptly
laughed. &ldquo;Odd thing to worry about. I suppose I <em>am</em>
becoming more a Brown. Horrible thing to contemplate. Ask your next
question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think you need worry about Taim,&rdquo; Moiraine
said absently. It was a link with Toman Head, however small and
tenuous. &ldquo;He will be dealt with as Logain was. What of Shadar
Logoth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shadar Logoth!&rdquo; Vandene snorted. &ldquo;In brief, the city
was destroyed by its own hate, every living thing except Mordeth,
the councilor who began it all, using the tactics of the
Darkfriends against the Darkfriends, and he now lies trapped there
waiting for a soul to steal. It is not safe to enter, and nothing
in the city is safe to touch. But every novice close to being
Accepted knows as much as that. In full, you will have to stay here
a month and listen to Adeleas lecture&mdash;she has the true
knowledge of it&mdash;but even I can tell you there&rsquo;s nothing of
the Dragon in it. That place was dead a hundred years before Yurian
Stonebow rose from the ashes of the Trolloc Wars, and he lies
closest to it in history of all the false Dragons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine raised a hand. &ldquo;I did not speak clearly, and
I do not speak of the Dragon, now, Reborn or false. Can you think
of any reason why a Fade would take something that had come from
Shadar Logoth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not if it knew the thing for what it was. The hate
that killed Shadar Logoth was hate they thought to use <em>
against</em> the Dark One; it would destroy Shadowspawn as surely
as it would those who walk in the Light. They rightly fear Shadar
Logoth as much as we.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what can you tell me of the Forsaken?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do leap from subject to subject. I can tell you
little more than you learned as a novice. No one knows much more of
the Nameless than that. Do you expect me to ramble on with what we
both learned as girls?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For an instant, Moiraine was silent. She did not want
to say too much, but Vandene and Adeleas had more knowledge their
fingertips than existed anywhere else but the White Tower, and more
complications awaited her there than she cared to deal with now.
She let the name slip between her lips as if it were escaping.
&ldquo;Lanfear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For once,&rdquo; the other woman sighed, &ldquo;I know not a
whit more than I did as a novice. The Daughter of the Night remains
as much a mystery as if she truly had cloaked herself in darkness.&rdquo;
She paused, peering into her cup, and when she looked up, her eyes
were sharp on Moiraine&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Lanfear was linked to the Dragon,
to Lews Therin Telamon. Moiraine, do you have some clue as to where
the Dragon will be Reborn? Or was Reborn? Has he come already?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I did,&rdquo; Moiraine replied levelly, &ldquo;would I be
here, instead of in the White Tower? The Amyrlin knows as much as
I, that I swear. Have you received a summons from her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, and I suppose we would. When the time comes that
we must face the Dragon Reborn, the Amyrlin will need every sister,
every Accepted, every novice who can light a candle unguided.&rdquo;
Vandene&rsquo;s voice lowered, musing. &ldquo;With such power as he will wield,
we must overwhelm him before he has a chance to use it against us,
before he can go mad and destroy the world. Yet first we must let
him face the Dark One.&rdquo; She laughed mirthlessly at the look on
Moiraine&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I am not a Red. I&rsquo;ve studied the Prophecies
enough to know we dare not gentle him first. If we <em>can</em>
gentle him. I know as well as you, as well as any sister who cares
to find out, that the seals holding the Dark One in Shayol Ghul are
weakening. The Illianers call the Great Hunt of the Horn. False
Dragons abound. And two of them, Logain and now this fellow in
Saldaea, able to channel. When was the last time the Reds found two
men channeling in less than a year? When did they last find one in
five years? Not in my lifetime, and I am a good deal older than
you. The signs are everywhere. Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don is coming. The Dark
One will break free. And the Dragon will be Reborn.&rdquo; Her cup
rattled as she set it down. &ldquo;I suppose that is why I feared you
might have seen some sign of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will come,&rdquo; Moiraine said smoothly, &ldquo;and we will
do what must be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I thought it would do any good, I&rsquo;d pull
Adeleas&rsquo;s nose out of her book and set off for the White Tower. But
I find I am glad to be here where I am instead. Perhaps we will
have time to finish our history.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope that you will, Sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vandene rose to her feet. &ldquo;Well, I have tasks to be
about before bed. If you have no more questions, I will leave you
to your studies.&rdquo; But she paused and revealed that however long she
had spent with books, she was still of the Green Ajah. &ldquo;You should
do something about Lan, Moiraine. The man is rumbling inside worse
than Dragonmount. Sooner or later, he will erupt. I&rsquo;ve known enough
men to see when one is troubled with a woman. You two have been
together a long time. Perhaps he has finally come to see you are a
woman as well as Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lan sees me as what I am, Vandene. Aes Sedai. And
still as a friend, I hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You Blues. Always so ready to save the world that
you lose yourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the white-haired Aes Sedai left, Moiraine
gathered her cloak and, muttering to herself, went into the garden.
There was something in what Vandene had said that tugged at her
mind, but she could not remember what it was. An answer, or a hint
to an answer, for a question she had not asked&mdash;but she could
not bring the question to mind, either.</p>

<p>The garden was small, like the house, but neat even
in moonlight aided by the yellow glow from the cottage windows,
with sandy walks between careful beds of flowers. She settled her
cloak loosely on her shoulders against the soft coolness of the
night. <em>What was the answer, and what was the question?</em></p>

<p>Sand crunched behind her, and she turned, thinking it
was Lan.</p>

<p>A shadow loomed dimly only a few paces from her, a
shadow that appeared to be a too-tall man wrapped in his
cloak. But the face caught the moon, gaunt-cheeked, pale, with
black eyes too big above a puckered, red-lipped mouth. The cloak
opened, unfolding into great wings like a bat&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Knowing it was too late, she opened herself to <em>
saidar</em>, but the Draghkar began to croon, and its soft hum
filled her, fragmenting her will. <em>Saidar</em> slipped away. She
felt only a vague sadness as she stepped toward the creature; the
deep crooning that drew her closer suppressed feeling. White, white
hands&mdash;like a man&rsquo;s hands, but tipped with claws&mdash;reached for her, and lips the color of blood curved in a travesty
of a smile, baring sharp teeth, but dimly, so dimly, she knew it
would not bite or tear. Fear the Draghkar&rsquo;s kiss. Once those lips
touched her, she would be as good as dead, to be drained of soul,
then of life. Whoever found her, even if they came as the Draghkar
let her fall, would find a corpse without a mark and cold as if
dead two days. And if they came before she was dead, what they
found would be worse, and not really her at all any longer. The
croon pulled her within reach of those pale hands, and the
Draghkar&rsquo;s head bent slowly toward her.</p>

<p>She felt only the smallest surprise when a sword
blade flashed over her shoulder to pierce the Draghkar&rsquo;s breast,
and little more when a second crossed her other shoulder to strike
beside the first.</p>

<p>Dazed, swaying, she watched as if from a great
distance as the creature was pushed back, away from her. Lan came
into her view, then Jaem, the gray-haired Warder&rsquo;s bony arms
holding his blade as straight and true as the younger man&rsquo;s. The
Draghkar&rsquo;s pale hands bloodied as they tore at the sharp steel,
wings buffeting the two men with thunderclaps. Suddenly, wounded
and bleeding, it began to croon again. To the Warders.</p>

<p>With an effort, Moiraine gathered herself; she felt
almost as drained as if the thing had managed its kiss. <em>No time
to be weak</em>. In an instant she opened herself to <em>
saidar</em> and, as the Power filled her, steeled herself to touch
the Shadowspawn directly. The two men were too close; anything
else would harm them, as well. Even using the One Power, she knew
she would feel soiled by the Draghkar.</p>

<p>But even as she began, Lan cried out, &ldquo;Embrace
death!&rdquo; Jaem echoed him firmly. &ldquo;Embrace death!&rdquo; And the two men
stepped within reach of the Draghkar&rsquo;s touch, drove home their
blades to the hilt.</p>

<p>Throwing back its head, the Draghkar bellowed, a
shriek that seemed to pierce Moiraine&rsquo;s head with needles. Even
wrapped in <em>saidar</em> she could feel it. Like a tree falling,
the Draghkar toppled, one wing knocking Jaem to his knees. Lan
sagged as if exhausted.</p>

<p>Lanterns hurried from the house, borne by Vandene and
Adeleas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was that noise?&rdquo; Adeleas demanded. She was
almost a mirror image of her sister. &ldquo;Has Jaem gone and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; The
lantern light fell on the Draghkar; her voice trailed off.</p>

<p>Vandene took Moiraine&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;It did not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo;
She left the question unfinished as, to Moiraine&rsquo;s eyes, a nimbus
surrounded her. Feeling strength flowing into her from the other
woman, Moiraine wished, not for the first time, that Aes Sedai
could do as much for themselves as they could for others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It did not,&rdquo; she said gratefully. &ldquo;See to the
Gaidin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan looked at her, mouth tight. &ldquo;If you had not made
me so angry I had to go work forms with Jaem, so angry I gave it up
to come back to the house&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I did,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The Pattern takes everything
into the weaving.&rdquo; Jaem was muttering, but still allowing Vandene
to see to his shoulder. He was all bone and tendon, yet looked as
hard as old roots.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How,&rdquo; Adeleas demanded, &ldquo;could any creature of the
Shadow come so close without us sensing it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was warded,&rdquo; Moiraine said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; Adeleas snapped. &ldquo;Only a sister could&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped, and Vandene turned from Jaem to look at
Moiraine.</p>

<p>Moiraine said the words none of them wanted to hear.
&ldquo;The Black Ajah.&rdquo; Shouts drifted from the village. &ldquo;Best you hide
this&mdash;&rdquo;she gestured to the Draghkar, sprawled across a flower
bed&mdash;&ldquo;quickly. They will be coming to ask if you need help,
but seeing this will start talk you will not like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; Adeleas said. &ldquo;Jaem, go and meet
them. Tell them you don&rsquo;t know what made the noise, but all is well
here. Slow them down.&rdquo; The gray-haired Warder hurried into the
night toward the sound of approaching villagers. Adeleas turned to
study the Draghkar as if it were a puzzling passage in one of her
books. &ldquo;Whether Aes Sedai are involved or not, whatever could have
brought it here?&rdquo; Vandene regarded Moiraine silently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear I must leave you,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;Lan, will
you ready the horses?&rdquo; As he left, she said, &ldquo;I will leave letters
with you to be sent on to the White Tower, if you will arrange it.&rdquo;
Adeleas nodded absently, her attention still on the thing on the
ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And will you find your answers where you are going?&rdquo;
Vandene asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may already have found one I did not know I
sought. I only hope I am not too late. I will need pen and
parchment.&rdquo; She drew Vandene toward the house, leaving Adeleas to
deal with the Draghkar.</p>
