<h4><em>The Shadow in Shienar</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">S</span>tilled.
The word seemed to quiver in the air, almost
visible. When it was done to a man who could channel the Power, who
must be stopped before madness drove him to the destruction of all
around him, it was called gentling, but for Aes Sedai it was
stilling. Stilled. No longer able to channel the flow of the One
Power. Able to sense <em>saidar</em>, the female half of the True
Source, but no longer having the ability to touch it. Remembering
what was gone forever. So seldom had it been done that every novice
was required to learn the name of each Aes Sedai since the Breaking
of the World who had been stilled, and her crime, but none could
think of it without a shudder. Women bore being stilled no better
than men did being gentled.</p>

<p>Moiraine had known the risk from the first, and she
knew it was necessary. That did not mean it was pleasant to dwell
on. Her eyes narrowed, and only the gleam in them showed her anger,
and her worry. &ldquo;Leane would follow you to the slopes of Shayol
Ghul, Siuan, and into the Pit of Doom. You cannot think she would
betray you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. But then, would she think it betrayal? Is it
betrayal to betray a traitor? Do you never think of that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never. What we do, Siuan, is what must be done. We
have both known it for nearly twenty years. The Wheel weaves as the
Wheel wills, and you and I were chosen for this by the Pattern. We
are a part of the Prophecies, and the Prophecies must be fulfilled.
Must!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Prophecies must be fulfilled. We were taught
that they will be, and must be, and yet that fulfillment is treason
to everything else we were taught. Some would say to everything we
stand for.&rdquo; Rubbing her arms, the Amyrlin Seat walked over to peer
through the narrow arrowslit at the garden below. She touched the
curtains. &ldquo;Here in the women&rsquo;s apartments they hang draperies to
soften the rooms, and they plant beautiful gardens, but there is no
part of this place not purpose-made for battle, death, and
killing.&rdquo; She continued in the same pensive tone. &ldquo;Only twice since
the Breaking of the World has the Amyrlin Seat been stripped of
stole and staff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tetsuan, who betrayed Manetheren for jealousy of
Elisande&rsquo;s powers, and Bonwhin, who tried to use Artur Hawkwing for
a puppet to control the world and so nearly destroyed Tar
Valon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin continued her study of the garden. &ldquo;Both
of the Red, and both replaced by an Amyrlin from the Blue. The reason
there has not been an Amyrlin chosen from the Red since Bonwhin,
and the reason the Red Ajah will take any pretext to pull down an
Amyrlin from the Blue, all wrapped neatly together. I have no wish
to be the third to lose the stole and the staff, Moiraine. For you,
of course, it would mean being stilled and put outside the Shining
Walls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elaida, for one, would never let me off so easily.&rdquo;
Moiraine watched her friend&rsquo;s back intently. <em>Light, what has
come over her? She has never been like this before. Where is her
strength, her fire?</em> &ldquo;But it will not come to that, Siuan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other woman went on as if she had not spoken.
&ldquo;For me, it would be different. Even stilled, an Amyrlin who has
been pulled down cannot be allowed to wander about loose; she might
be seen as a martyr, become a rallying point for opposition.
Tetsuan and Bonwhin were kept in the White Tower as servants.
Scullery maids, who could be pointed to as cautions as to what can
happen to the mightiest. No one can rally around a woman who must
scrub floors and pots all day. Pity her, yes, but not rally to
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eyes blazing, Moiraine leaned her fists on the table.
&ldquo;Look at me, Siuan. Look at me! Are you saying that you
want to give up, after all these years, after all we have done?
Give up, and let the world go? And all for fear of a switching for
not getting the pots clean enough!&rdquo; She put into it all the scorn
she could summon, and was relieved when her friend spun to face
her. The strength was still there, strained but still there. Those
clear blue eyes were as hot with anger as her own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember which of the two of us squealed the
loudest when we were switched as novices. You had lived a soft life
in Cairhien, Moiraine. Not like working a fishing boat.&rdquo; Abruptly
Siuan slapped the table with a loud crack. &ldquo;No, I am not suggesting
giving up, but neither do I propose to watch everything slide out
of our hands <em>while I can do nothing!</em> Most of my troubles
with the Hall stem from you. Even the Greens wonder why I haven&rsquo;t
called you to the Tower and taught you a little discipline. Half
the sisters with me think you should be handed over to the Reds,
and if that happens, you will wish you were a novice again, with
nothing worse to look forward to than a switching. Light! If any of
them remember we were friends as novices, I&rsquo;d be there beside
you.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had a plan! A plan, Moiraine! Locate the boy and
bring him to Tar Valon, where we could hide him, keep him safe and
guide him. Since you left the Tower, I have had only two messages
from you. Two! I feel as if I&rsquo;m trying to sail the Fingers of the
Dragon in the dark. One message to say you were entering the Two
Rivers, going to this village, this Emond&rsquo;s Field. Soon, I thought.
He&rsquo;s found, and she&rsquo;ll have him in hand soon. Then word from
Caemlyn to say you were coming to Shienar, to Fal Dara, not Tar
Valon. Fal Dara, with the Blight almost close enough to touch. Fal
Dara, where Trollocs raid and Myrddraal ride as near every day as
makes no difference. Nearly twenty years of planning and searching,
and you toss all our plans practically in the Dark One&rsquo;s face. Are
you mad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now that she had stirred life in the other woman,
Moiraine returned to outward calm, herself. Calm, but firm
insistence, too. &ldquo;The Pattern pays no heed to human plans, Siuan.
With all our scheming, we forgot what we were dealing with.
<em>Ta&rsquo;veren</em>. Elaida is wrong. Artur Paendrag Tanreall was
never this strongly <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>. The Wheel will weave the
Pattern around this young man as <em>it</em> wills, whatever our
plans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The anger left Amyrlin&rsquo;s face, replaced by
white-faced shock. &ldquo;It sounds as if <em>you</em> are saying we
might as well give up. Do <em>you</em> now suggest standing aside
and watching the world burn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Siuan. Never standing aside.&rdquo; <em>Yet the world
will burn, Siuan, one way or another, whatever we do. You could
never see that</em>. &ldquo;But we must now realize that our plans are
precarious things. We have even less control than we thought.
Perhaps only a fingernail&rsquo;s grip. The winds of destiny are blowing,
Siuan, and we must ride them where they take us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin shivered as if she felt those winds icy
on the back of her neck. Her hands went to the flattened cube of
gold, blunt, capable fingers finding precise points in the complex
designs. Cunningly balanced, the top lifted back to reveal a
curled, golden horn nestled within a space designed to hold it. She
lifted the instrument and traced the flowing silver script, in the
Old Tongue, inlaid around the flaring mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;The grave is no bar to my call,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; she translated,
so softly she seemed to be speaking to herself. &ldquo;The Horn of
Valere, made to call dead heroes back from the grave. And prophecy
said it would only be found just in time for the Last Battle.&rdquo;
Abruptly she thrust the Horn back into its niche and closed the lid
as if she could no longer bear the sight of it. &ldquo;Agelmar pushed it
into my hands as soon as the Welcome was done. He said he was
afraid to go into his own strongroom any longer, with it there. The
temptation was too great, he said. To sound the Horn himself and
lead the host that answered its call north through the Blight to
level Shayol Ghul itself and put an end to the Dark One. He burned
with the ecstasy of glory, and it was that, he said, that told him
it was not to be him, must not be him. He could not wait to be rid
of it, yet he wanted it still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine nodded. Agelmar was familiar with the
Prophecy of the Horn; most who fought the Dark One were. &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;Let
whosoever sounds me think not of glory, but only of salvation.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Salvation.&rdquo; The Amyrlin laughed bitterly. &ldquo;From the
look in Agelmar&rsquo;s eyes, he didn&rsquo;t know whether he was giving away
salvation or rejecting the condemnation of his own soul. He only
knew he had to be rid of it before it burned him up. He has tried
to keep it secret, but he says there are rumors in the keep
already. I do not feel his temptation, yet the Horn still makes my
skin crawl. He will have to take it back into his strongroom until
I leave. I could not sleep with it even in the next room.&rdquo; She
rubbed frown lines from her forehead and sighed. &ldquo;And it was not to
be found until just before the Last Battle. Can it be that close? I
thought, hoped, we would have more time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <em>Karaethon Cycle</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Moiraine. You do not have to remind me. I&rsquo;ve
lived with the Prophecies of the Dragon as long as you.&rdquo; The
Amyrlin shook her head. &ldquo;Never more than one false Dragon in a
generation since the Breaking, and now three loose in the world at
one time, and three more in the past two years. The Pattern demands
a Dragon because the Pattern weaves toward Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don.
Sometimes doubt fills me, Moiraine.&rdquo; She said it musingly, as if
wondering at it, and went on in the same tone. &ldquo;What if Logain was
the one? He could channel, before the Reds brought him to the White
Tower, and we gentled him. So can Mazrim Taim, the man in Saldaea.
What if it is him? There are sisters in Saldaea already; he may be
taken by now. What if we have been wrong since the start? What
happens if the Dragon Reborn is gentled before the Last Battle even
begins? Even prophecy can fail if the one prophesied is slain or
gentled. And then we face the Dark One naked to the storm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither of them is the one, Siuan. The Pattern does
not demand <em>a</em> Dragon, but the one true Dragon. Until he
proclaims himself, the Pattern will continue to throw up false
Dragons, but after that there will be no others. If Logain or the
other were the one, there would be no others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;For he shall come like the breaking dawn, and
shatter the world again with his coming, and make it anew.&rsquo; Either
we go naked in the storm, or cling to a protection that will
scourge us. The Light help us all.&rdquo; The Amyrlin shook herself as if
to throw off her own words. Her face was set, as though bracing for
a blow. &ldquo;You could never hide what you were thinking from me as you
do from everyone else, Moiraine. You have more to tell me, and
nothing good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For answer Moiraine took the leather pouch from her
belt and upended it, spilling the contents on the table. It
appeared to be only a heap of fragmented pottery, shiny black and
white.</p>

<p>The Amyrlin Seat touched one bit curiously, and her
breath caught. &ldquo;<em>Cuendillar</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heartstone,&rdquo; Moiraine agreed. The making of
<em>cuendillar</em> had been lost at the Breaking of the World, but
what had been made of heartstone had survived the cataclysm. Even
those objects swallowed by the earth or sunk in the sea had
survived; they must have. No known force could break
<em>cuendillar</em> once it was complete; even the One Power
directed against heartstone only made it stronger. Except that some
power <em>had</em> broken this.</p>

<p>The Amyrlin hastily assembled the pieces. What they
formed was a disk the size of a man&rsquo;s hand, half blacker than pitch
and half whiter than snow, the colors meeting along a sinuous line,
unfaded by age. The ancient symbol of Aes Sedai, before the world
was broken, when men and women wielded the Power together. Half of
it was now called the Flame of Tar Valon; the other half was
scrawled on doors, the Dragon&rsquo;s Fang, to accuse those within of
evil. Only seven like it had been made; everything ever made of
heartstone was recorded in the White Tower, and those seven were
remembered above all. Siuan Sanche stared at it as she would have
at a viper on her pillow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the seals on the Dark One&rsquo;s prison,&rdquo; she said
finally, reluctantly. It was those seven seals over which the
Amyrlin Seat was supposed to be Watcher. The secret hidden from the
world, if the world ever thought of it, was that no Amyrlin Seat
had known where any of the seals were since the Trolloc Wars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know the Dark One is stirring, Siuan. We know his
prison cannot stay sealed forever. Human work can never match the
Creator&rsquo;s. We knew he has touched the world again, even if, thank
the Light, only indirectly. Darkfriends multiply, and what we
called evil but ten years ago seems almost caprice compared with
what now is done every day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the seals are already breaking&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;We may have
no time at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little enough. But that little may be enough. It
will have to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin touched the fractured seal, and her voice
grew tight, as if she were forcing herself to speak. &ldquo;I saw the
boy, you know, in the courtyard during the Welcome. It is one of my
Talents, seeing <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>. A rare Talent these days, even
more rare than <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, and certainly not of much use. A
tall boy, a fairly handsome young man. Not much different from any
young man you might see in any town.&rdquo; She paused to draw breath.
&ldquo;Moiraine, he blazed like the sun. I&rsquo;ve seldom been afraid in my
life, but the sight of him made me afraid right down to my toes. I
wanted to cower, to howl. I could barely speak. Agelmar thought I
was angry with him, I said so little. That young man&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;he&rsquo;s the
one we have sought these twenty years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a hint of question in her voice. Moiraine
answered it. &ldquo;He is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you certain? Can he&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Can he&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;channel
the One Power?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her mouth strained around the words, and Moiraine
felt the tension, too, a twisting inside, a cold clutching at her
heart. She kept her face smooth, though. &ldquo;He can.&rdquo; A man wielding
the One Power. That was a thing no Aes Sedai could contemplate
without fear. It was a thing the whole world feared. <em>And I will
loose it on the world</em>. &ldquo;Rand al&rsquo;Thor will stand before the
world as the Dragon Reborn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin shuddered. &ldquo;Rand al&rsquo;Thor. It does not
sound like a name to inspire fear and set the world on fire.&rdquo; She
gave another shiver and rubbed her arms briskly, but her eyes
suddenly shone with a purposeful light. &ldquo;If he is the one, then we
truly may have time enough. But is he safe here? I have two Red
sisters with me, and I can no longer answer for Green or Yellow,
either. The Light consume me, I can&rsquo;t answer for any of them, not
with this. Even Verin and Serafelle would leap on him the way they
would a scarlet adder in a nursery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is safe, for the moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin waited for her to say more. The silence
stretched, until it was plain she would not. Finally the Amyrlin
said, &ldquo;You say our old plan is useless. What do you suggest
now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have purposely let him think I no longer have any
interest in him, that he may go where he pleases for all of me.&rdquo;
She raised her hands as the Amyrlin opened her mouth. &ldquo;It was
necessary, Siuan. Rand al&rsquo;Thor was raised in the Two Rivers, where
Manetheren&rsquo;s stubborn blood flows in every vein, and his own blood
is like rock beside clay compared to Manetheren&rsquo;s. He must be
handled gently, or he will bolt in any direction but the one we
want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll handle him like a newborn babe. We&rsquo;ll
wrap him in swaddling clothes and play with his toes, if that&rsquo;s
what you think we need. But to what immediate purpose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His two friends, Matrim Cauthon and Perrin Aybara,
are ripe to see the world before they sink back into the obscurity
of the Two Rivers. If they can sink back; they are
<em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, too, if lesser than he. I will induce them to
carry the Horn of Valere to Illian.&rdquo; She hesitated, frowning.
&ldquo;There is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a problem with Mat. He carries a dagger from Shadar
Logoth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shadar Logoth! Light, why did you ever let them get
near that place. Every stone of it is tainted. There isn&rsquo;t a pebble
safe to carry away. Light help us, if Mordeth touched the boy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; The Amyrlin sounded as though she were strangling. &ldquo;If that
happened, the world would be doomed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it did not, Siuan. We do what we must from
necessity, and it was necessary. I have done enough so that Mat
will not infect others, but he had the dagger too long before I
knew. The link is still there. I had thought I must take him to Tar
Valon to cure it, but with so many sisters present, it might be
done here. So long as there are a few you can trust not to see
Darkfriends where there are none. You and I and two others will
suffice, using my <em>angreal</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leane will do for one, and I can find another.&rdquo;
Suddenly the Amyrlin Seat gave a wry grin. &ldquo;The Hall wants that
<em>angreal</em> back, Moiraine. There are not very many of them
left, and you are now considered&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;unreliable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine smiled, but it did not touch her eyes. &ldquo;They
will think worse of me before I am done. Mat will leap at the
chance to be so big a part of the legend of the Horn, and Perrin
should not be hard to convince. He needs something to take his mind
off his own troubles. Rand knows what he is&mdash;some of it, at
least; a little&mdash;and he is afraid of it, naturally. He wants
to go off somewhere alone, where he cannot hurt anyone. He says he
will never wield the Power again, but he fears not being able to
stop it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As well he might. Easier to give up drinking
water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly. And he wants to be free from Aes Sedai.&rdquo;
Moiraine gave a small, mirthless smile. &ldquo;Offered the chance to
leave Aes Sedai behind and still stay with his friends a while
longer, he should be as eager as Mat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how is he leaving Aes Sedai behind? Surely you
must travel with him. We can&rsquo;t lose him now, Moiraine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot travel with him.&rdquo; <em>It is a long way from
Fal Dara to Illian, but he has traveled almost as far already</em>.
&ldquo;He must be let off the leash for a time. There is no help for it.
I have had all of their old clothes burned. There has been too much
opportunity for some shred of what they were wearing to have fallen
into the wrong hands. I will cleanse them before they leave; they
will not even realize it has been done. There will be no chance
they can be tracked that way, and the only other threat of that
kind is locked away here in the dungeon.&rdquo; The Amyrlin, midway in
nodding approval, gave her a questioning look, but she did not
pause. &ldquo;They will travel as safely as I can manage, Siuan. And when
Rand needs me in Illian, I will be there, and I will see that it is
he who presents the Horn to the Council of Nine and the Assemblage.
I will see to everything in Illian. Siuan, the Illianers would
follow the Dragon, or Ba&rsquo;alzamon himself, if he came bearing the
Horn of Valere, and so will the greater part of those gathered for
the Hunt. The true Dragon Reborn will not need to gather a
following before nations move against him. He will begin with a
nation around him and an army at his back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin dropped back into her chair, but
immediately leaned forward. She seemed caught between weariness and
hope. &ldquo;But <em>will</em> he proclaim himself? If he&rsquo;s afraid&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The Light knows he should be, Moiraine, but men who name themselves
as the Dragon <em>want</em> the power. If he does not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have the means to see him named Dragon whether he
wills it or not. And even if I somehow fail, the Pattern itself
will see him named Dragon whether he wills it or not. Remember, he
is <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, Siuan. He has no more control over his fate
than a candle wick has over the flame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin sighed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s risky, Moiraine. Risky. But
my father used to say, &lsquo;Girl, if you won&rsquo;t take a chance, you&rsquo;ll
never win a copper.&rsquo; We have plans to make. Sit down; this won&rsquo;t be
done quickly. I will send for wine and cheese.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine shook her head. &ldquo;We have been closeted alone
too long already. If any did try listening and found your Warding,
they will be wondering already. It is not worth the risk. We can
contrive another meeting tomorrow.&rdquo; <em>Besides, my dearest friend,
I cannot tell you everything, and I cannot risk letting you know I
am holding anything back</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you are right. But first thing in the
morning. There&rsquo;s so much I have to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The morning,&rdquo; Moiraine agreed. The Amyrlin rose, and
they hugged again. &ldquo;In the morning I will tell you everything you
need to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leane gave Moiraine a sharp look when she came out
into the anteroom, then darted into the Amyrlin&rsquo;s chamber. Moiraine
tried to put on a chastened face, as if she had endured one of the
Amyrlin&rsquo;s infamous upbraidings&mdash;most women, however
strong-willed, returned from those big-eyed and weak-kneed&mdash;but the expression was foreign to her. She looked more angry than
anything else, which served much the same purpose. She was only
vaguely aware of the other women in the outer room; she thought
some had gone and others come since she went in, but she barely
looked at them. The hour was growing late, and there was much to be
done before the morning came. Much, before she spoke to the Amyrlin
Seat again.</p>

<p>Quickening her step, she moved deeper into the
keep.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The column would have made an impressive sight under
the waxing moon, moving through the Tarabon night to the jangle of
harness, had there been anyone to see it. A full two thousand
Children of the Light, well mounted, in white tabards and cloaks,
armor burnished, with their train of supply wagons, and farriers,
and grooms with the strings of remounts. There were villages in
this sparsely forested country, but they had left roads behind, and
stayed clear of even farmers&rsquo; crofts. They were to meet&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;someone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;at a flyspeck village near the northern border of
Tarabon, at the edge of Almoth Plain.</p>

<p>Geofram Bornhald, riding at the head of his men,
wondered what it was all about. He remembered too well his
interview with Pedron Niall, Lord Captain Commander of the Children
of the Light, in Amador, but he had learned little there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>We are alone, Geofram,&rdquo; the white-haired man had
said. His voice was thin and reedy with age. &ldquo;I remember giving you
the oath&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;what&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;thirty-six years ago, it must be,
now.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>Bornhald straightened. &ldquo;My Lord Captain
Commander, may I ask why I was called back from Caemlyn, and with
such urgency? A push, and Morgase could be toppled. There are
Houses in Andor that see dealing with Tar Valon as we do, and they
were ready to lay claim to the throne. I left Eamon Valda in
charge, but he seemed intent on following the Daughter-Heir to Tar
Valon. I would not be surprised to learn the man has kidnapped the
girl, or even attacked Tar Valon.&rdquo; And Dain, Bornhald&rsquo;s son, had
arrived just before Bornhald was recalled. Dain was full of zeal.
Too much zeal, sometimes. Enough to fall in blindly with whatever
Valda proposed.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Valda walks in the Light, Geofram. But you are
the best battle commander among the Children. You will assemble a
full legion, the best men you can find, and take them into Tarabon,
avoiding any eyes attached to a tongue that may speak. Any such
tongue must be silenced, if the eyes see.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>Bornhald hesitated. Fifty Children together, or
even a hundred, could enter any land without question, at least
without open question, but an entire legion&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;Is it war, my
Lord Captain Commander? There is talk in the streets. Wild rumors,
mainly, about Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s armies come back.&rdquo; The old man did
not speak. &ldquo;The King&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Does not command the Children, Lord Captain
Bornhald.&rdquo; For the first time there was a snap in the Lord Captain
Commander&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;I do. Let the King sit in his palace and do
what he does best. Nothing. You will be met at a village called
Alcruna, and there you will receive your final orders. I expect
your legion to ride in three days. Now go, Geofram. You have work
to do.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>Bornhald frowned. &ldquo;Pardon, my Lord Captain
Commander, but who will meet me? Why am I risking war with
Tarabon?&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>You will be told what you must know when you
reach Alcruna.&rdquo; The Lord Captain Commander suddenly looked more
than his age. Absently he plucked at his white tunic, with the
golden sunburst of the Children large on the chest. &ldquo;There are
forces at work beyond what you know, Geofram. Beyond what even
you</em> can <em>know. Choose your men quickly. Now go. Ask me no
more. And the Light ride with you.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Now Bornhald straightened in his saddle, working a
knot out of his back. <em>I am getting old</em>, he thought. A day
and a night in the saddle, with two pauses to water the horses, and
he felt every gray hair on his head. He would not even have noticed
a few years ago. <em>At least I have not killed any innocents</em>.
He could be as hard on Darkfriends as any man sworn to the Light&mdash;Darkfriends must be destroyed before they pulled the whole
world under the Shadow&mdash;but he wanted to be sure they
<em>were</em> Darkfriends first. It had been difficult avoiding
Taraboner eyes with so many men, even in the backcountry, but he
had managed it. No tongues had needed to be silenced.</p>

<p>The scouts he had sent out came riding back, and
behind them came more men in white cloaks, some carrying torches to
ruin the night vision of everyone at the head of the column. With a
muttered curse, Bornhald ordered a halt while he studied those who
came to meet him.</p>

<p>Their cloaks bore the same golden sunburst on the
breast as his, the same as every Child of the Light, and their
leader even had golden knots of rank below it equivalent to
Bornhald&rsquo;s. But behind their sunbursts were red shepherd&rsquo;s crooks.
Questioners. With hot irons and pinchers and dripping water the
Questioners pulled confession and repentance from Darkfriends, but
there were those who said they decided guilt before ever they
began. Geofram Bornhald was one who said it.</p>

<p><em>I have been sent here to meet</em>
Questioners?</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have been waiting for you, Lord Captain
Bornhald,&rdquo; the leader said in a harsh voice. He was a tall,
hook-nosed man with the gleam of certainty in his eyes that every
Questioner had. &ldquo;You could have made better time. I am Einor Saren,
second to Jaichim Carridin, who commands the Hand of the Light in
Tarabon.&rdquo; The Hand of the Light&mdash;the Hand that dug out truth,
so they said. They did not like the name Questioners. &ldquo;There is a
bridge at the village. Have your men move across. We will talk in
the inn. It is surprisingly comfortable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was told by the Lord Captain Commander himself to
avoid all eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The village has been&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;pacified. Now move your
men. <em>I</em> command, now. I have orders with the Lord Captain
Commander&rsquo;s seal, if you doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bornhald suppressed the growl that rose in his
throat. Pacified. He wondered if the bodies had been piled outside
the village, or if they had been thrown into the river. It would be
like the Questioners, cold enough to kill an entire village for
secrecy and stupid enough to throw the bodies into the river to
float downstream and trumpet their deed from Alcruna to Tanchico.
&ldquo;What I doubt is why I am in Tarabon with two thousand men,
Questioner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Saren&rsquo;s face tightened, but his voice remained harsh
and demanding. &ldquo;It is simple, Lord Captain. There are towns and
villages across Almoth Plain with none in authority above a mayor
or a Town Council. It is past time they were brought to the Light.
There will be many Darkfriends in such places.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bornhald&rsquo;s horse stamped. &ldquo;Are you saying, Saren,
that I&rsquo;ve brought an entire legion across most of Tarabon in
secrecy to root a few Darkfriends out of some grubby villages?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are here to do as you are told, Bornhald. To do
the work of the Light! Or are you sliding from the Light?&rdquo; Saren&rsquo;s
smile was a grimace. &ldquo;If battle is what you seek, you may have your
chance. The strangers have a great force on Toman Head, more than
Tarabon and Arad Doman together may be able to hold, even if they
can stop their own bickering long enough to work together. If the
strangers break through, you will have all the fighting you can
handle. The Taraboners claim the strangers are monsters, creatures
of the Dark One. Some say they have Aes Sedai to fight for them. If
they <em>are</em> Darkfriends, these strangers, they will have to
be dealt with, too. In their turn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment, Bornhald stopped breathing. &ldquo;Then the
rumors are true. Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s armies have returned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strangers,&rdquo; Saren said flatly. He sounded as if he
regretted having mentioned them. &ldquo;Strangers, and probably
Darkfriends, from wherever they came. That is all we know, and all
you need to know. They do not concern you now. We are wasting time.
Move your men across the river, Bornhald. I will give you your
orders in the village.&rdquo; He whirled his horse and galloped back the
way he had come, his torchbearers riding at his heels.</p>

<p>Bornhald closed his eyes to hasten the return of his
night sight. <em>We are being used like stones on a board</em>.
&ldquo;Byar!&rdquo; He opened his eyes as his second appeared at his side,
stiffening in his saddle before the Lord Captain. The gaunt-faced
man had almost the Questioner&rsquo;s light in his eyes, but he was a
good soldier despite. &ldquo;There is a bridge ahead. Move the legion
across the river and make camp. I will join you as soon as I
can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gathered his reins and rode in the direction the
Questioner had taken. <em>Stones on a board. But who is moving us?
And why?</em></p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Afternoon shadows gave way to evening as Liandrin
made her way through the women&rsquo;s apartments. Beyond the arrowslits,
darkness grew and pressed on the light from the lamps in the
corridor. Twilight was a troubled time for Liandrin of late, that
and dawn. At dawn the day was born, just as twilight gave birth to
night, but at dawn, night died, and at twilight, day. The Dark
One&rsquo;s power was rooted in death; he gained power from death, and at
those times she thought she could feel his power stirring.
Something stirred in the half dark, at least. Something she almost
thought she could catch if she turned quickly enough, something she
was sure she could see if she looked hard enough.</p>

<p>Serving women in black-and-gold curtsied as she
passed, but she did not respond. She kept her eyes fixed straight
ahead, and did not see them.</p>

<p>At the door she sought, she paused for a quick glance
up and down the hall. The only women in sight were servants; there
were no men, of course. She pushed open the door and went in
without knocking.</p>

<p>The outer room of the Lady Amalisa&rsquo;s chambers was
brightly lit, and a blazing fire on the hearth held back the chill
of the Shienaran night. Amalisa and her ladies sat about the room,
in chairs and on the layered carpets, listening while one of their
number, standing, read aloud to them. It was <em>The Dance of the
Hawk and the Hummingbird</em>, by Teven Aerwin, which purported to
set forth the proper conduct of men toward women and women toward
men. Liandrin&rsquo;s mouth tightened; she certainly had not read it, but
she had heard as much as she needed about it. Amalisa and her
ladies greeted each pronouncement with gales of laughter, falling
against each other and drumming their heels on the carpets like
girls.</p>

<p>The reader was the first to become aware of
Liandrin&rsquo;s presence. She cut off with a surprised widening of her
eyes. The others turned to see what she was staring at, and silence
replaced laughter. All but Amalisa scrambled to their feet, hastily
smoothing hair and skirts.</p>

<p>The Lady Amalisa rose gracefully, with a smile. &ldquo;You
honor us with your presence, Liandrin. This is a most pleasant
surprise. I did not expect you until tomorrow. I thought you would
want to rest after your long jour&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Liandrin cut her off sharply, addressing the air. &ldquo;I
will speak to the Lady Amalisa alone. All of you will leave.
Now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a moment of shocked silence, then the other
women made their goodbyes to Amalisa. One by one they curtsied to
Liandrin, but she did not acknowledge them. She continued to stare
straight ahead at nothing, but she saw them, and heard. Honorifics
offered with breathy unease at the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s mood. Eyes falling
when she ignored them. They squeezed past her to the door, pressing
back awkwardly so their skirts did not disturb hers.</p>

<p>As the door closed behind the last of them, Amalisa
said, &ldquo;Liandrin, I do not underst&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you walk in the Light, my daughter?&rdquo; There would
be none of that foolishness of calling her sister here. The other
woman was older by some years, but the ancient forms would be
observed. However long they had been forgotten, it was time they
were remembered.</p>

<p>As soon as the question was out of her mouth, though,
Liandrin realized she had made a mistake. It was a question
guaranteed to cause doubt and anxiety, coming from an Aes Sedai,
but Amalisa&rsquo;s back stiffened, and her face hardened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is an insult, Liandrin Sedai. I am Shienaran,
of a noble House and the blood of soldiers. My line has fought the
Shadow since before there <em>was</em> a Shienar, three thousand
years without fail or a day&rsquo;s weakness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Liandrin shifted her point of attack, but she did not
retreat. Striding across the room, she took the leather-bound copy
of <em>The Dance of the Hawk and the Hummingbird</em> from the
mantelpiece and hefted it without looking at it. &ldquo;In Shienar above
other lands, my daughter, the Light must be precious, and the
Shadow feared.&rdquo; Casually she threw the book into the fire. Flames
leaped as if it were a log of fat-wood, thundering as they licked
up the chimney. In the same instant every lamp in the room flared,
hissing, so fiercely did they burn, flooding the chamber with
light. &ldquo;Here above all. Here, so close to the cursed Blight, where
corruption waits. Here, even one who thinks he walks in the Light
may still be corrupted by the Shadow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beads of sweat glistened on Amalisa&rsquo;s forehead. The
hand she had raised in protest for her book fell slowly to her
side. Her features still held firm, but Liandrin saw her swallow,
and her feet shift. &ldquo;I do not understand, Liandrin Sedai. Is it the
book? It is only foolishness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a faint quaver in her voice. <em>Good</em>.
Glass lamp mantles cracked as the flames leaped higher and hotter,
lighting the room as bright as unsheltered noon. Amalisa stood as
stiff as a post, her face tight as she tried not to squint.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is you who are foolish, my daughter. I care
nothing for books. Here, men enter the Blight, and walk in its
taint. In the very Shadow. Why wonder you that that taint may seep
into them? Whether or not against their will, still it may seep.
Why think you the Amyrlin Seat herself has come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; It was a gasp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of the Red am I, my daughter,&rdquo; Liandrin said
relentlessly. &ldquo;I hunt all men corrupted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not only those foul ones who try the One Power. All
men corrupted. High and low do I hunt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Amalisa licked her lips unsteadily
and made a visible fort to gather herself. &ldquo;I do not understand,
Liandrin Sedai. Please&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;High even before low.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; As if some invisible support had vanished,
Amalisa fell to her knees, and her head dropped. &ldquo;Please, Liandrin
Sedai, say you do not mean Agelmar. It cannot be him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In that moment of doubt and confusion, Liandrin
struck. She did not move, but lashed out with the One Power.
Amalisa gasped and gave a jerk, as if she had been pricked with a
needle, and Liandrin&rsquo;s petulant mouth perked in a smile.</p>

<p>This was her own special trick from childhood, the
first learned of her abilities. It had been forbidden to her as
soon as the Mistress of Novices discovered it, but to Liandrin that
only meant one more thing she needed to conceal from those who were
jealous of her.</p>

<p>She strode forward and pulled Amalisa&rsquo;s chin up. The
metal that had stiffened her was still there, but it was baser
metal now, malleable to the right pressures. Tears trickled from
the corners of Amalisa&rsquo;s eyes, glistening on her cheeks. Liandrin
let the fires die back to normal; there was no longer any need for
such. She softened her words, but her voice was as unyielding as
steel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Daughter, no one wants to see you and Agelmar thrown
to the people as Darkfriends. I will help you, but you must
help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;H-help you?&rdquo; Amalisa put her hands to her temples;
she looked confused. &ldquo;Please, Liandrin Sedai, I don&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;understand. It is all so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s all&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not a perfect ability; Liandrin could not
force anyone to do what she wanted&mdash;though she had tried; oh,
how she had tried. But she could open them wide to her arguments,
make them want to believe her, want more than anything to be
convinced of her rightness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Obey, daughter. Obey, and answer my questions
truthfully, and I promise that no one will speak of you and Agelmar
as Darkfriends. You will not be dragged naked through the streets,
to be flogged from the city if the people do not tear you to pieces
first. I will not let this happen. You understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Liandrin Sedai, yes. I will do as you say and
answer you truly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Liandrin straightened, looking down at the other
woman. The Lady Amalisa stayed as she was, kneeling, her face as
open as a child&rsquo;s, a child waiting to be comforted and helped by
someone wiser and stronger. There was a rightness about it to
Liandrin. She had never understood why a simple bow or curtsy was
sufficient for Aes Sedai when men and women knelt to kings and
queens. <em>What queen has within her my power?</em> Her mouth
twisted angrily, and Amalisa shivered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be easy in yourself, my daughter. I have come to
help you, not to punish. Only those who deserve it will be
punished. Truth only, speak to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will, Liandrin Sedai. I will, I swear it by my
House and honor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moiraine came to Fal Dara with a Darkfriend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amalisa was too frightened to show surprise. &ldquo;Oh, no,
Liandrin Sedai. No. That man came later. He is in the dungeons
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Later, you say. But it is true that she speaks often
with him? She is often in company with this Darkfriend? Alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;S-sometimes, Liandrin Sedai. Only sometimes. She
wishes to find out why he came here. Moiraine Sedai is&mdash;&rdquo;
Liandrin held up her hand sharply, and Amalisa swallowed whatever
else she had been going to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By three young men Moiraine was accompanied. This I
<em>know</em>. Where are they? I have been to their rooms, and they
are not to be found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I do not know, Liandrin Sedai. They seem
nice boys. Surely you don&rsquo;t think they are Darkfriends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not Darkfriends, no. Worse. By far more dangerous
than Darkfriends, my daughter. The entire world is in danger from
them. They must be found. You will command your servants to search
the keep, and your ladies, and yourself. Every crack and cranny. To
this, you will see personally. Personally! And to no one will you
speak of it, save those I name. None else may know. None. From Fal
Dara in secrecy these young men must be removed, and to Tar Valon
taken. In utter secrecy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you command, Liandrin Sedai. But I do not
understand the need for secrecy. No one here will hinder Aes
Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of the Black Ajah you have heard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amalisa&rsquo;s eyes bulged, and she leaned back away from
Liandrin, raising her hands as though to shield herself from a
blow. &ldquo;A v-vile rumor, Liandrin Sedai. V-vile. There are n-no Aes
Sedai who s-serve the Dark One. I do not believe it. You must
believe me! Under the Light, I s-swear I do not believe it. By my
honor and my House, I swear&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Coolly Liandrin let her go on, watching the last
remaining strength leach out of the other woman with her own
silence. Aes Sedai had been known to become angry, very angry, with
those who even mentioned the Black Ajah, much less those who said
they believed in its hidden existence. After this, with her will
already weakened by that little childhood trick, Amalisa would be
as clay in her hands. After one more blow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Black Ajah is <em>real</em>, child. Real, and
here within Fal Dara&rsquo;s walls.&rdquo; Amalisa knelt there, her mouth
hanging open. The Black Ajah. Aes Sedai who were also Darkfriends.
Almost as horrible to learn the Dark One himself walked Fal Dara
keep. But Liandrin would not let up now. &ldquo;Any Aes Sedai in the
halls you pass, a Black sister could be. This I swear. I cannot
tell you which they are, but my protection you can have. If in the
Light you walk and me obey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; Amalisa whispered hoarsely. &ldquo;I will.
Please, Liandrin Sedai, please say you will protect my brother, and
my ladies&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who deserves protection I will protect. Concern
yourself with yourself, my daughter. And think only of what I have
commanded of you. Only that. The fate of the world rides on this,
my daughter. All else you must forget.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Liandrin Sedai. Yes. Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Liandrin turned and crossed the room, not looking
back until she reached the door. Amalisa was still on her knees,
still watching her anxiously. &ldquo;Rise, my Lady Amalisa.&rdquo; Liandrin
made her voice pleasant, with only a hint of the mocking she felt.
<em>Sister, indeed! Not one day as a novice would she last. And
power to command</em> she <em>has</em>. &ldquo;Rise.&rdquo; Amalisa
straightened in slow, stiff jerks, as if she had been bound hand
and foot for hours. As she finally came upright, Liandrin said, the
steel back in full strength, &ldquo;And if you fail the world, if you
fail me, that wretched Darkfriend in the dungeon will be your
envy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the look on Amalisa&rsquo;s face, Liandrin did not
think failure would come from any lack of effort on her part.</p>

<p>Pulling the door shut behind her, Liandrin suddenly
felt a prickling across her skin. Breath catching, she whirled
about, looking up and down the dimly lit hall. Empty. It was full
night beyond the arrowslits. The hall was empty, yet she was sure
there had been eyes on her. The vacant corridor, shadowy between
the lamps on the walls, mocked her. She shrugged uneasily, then
started down the hall determinedly. <em>Fancies take me. Nothing
more</em>.</p>

<p>Full night already, and there was much to do before
dawn. Her orders had been explicit.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Pitch-blackness covered the dungeons whatever the
hour, unless someone brought in a lantern, but Padan Fain sat on
the edge of his cot, staring into the dark with a smile on his
face. He could hear the other two prisoners grumbling in their
sleep, muttering in nightmares. Padan Fain was waiting for
something, something he had been awaiting for a long time. For too
long. But not much longer.</p>

<p>The door to the outer guardroom opened, spilling in a
flood of light, darkly outlining a figure in the doorway.</p>

<p>Fain stood. &ldquo;You! Not who I expected.&rdquo; He stretched
with a casualness he did not feel. Blood raced through his veins;
he thought he could leap over the keep if he tried. &ldquo;Surprises for
everyone, eh? Well, come on. The night&rsquo;s getting old, and I want
some sleep sometime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a lamp came into the cell chamber, Fain raised his
head, grinning at something, unseen yet felt, beyond the dungeon&rsquo;s
stone ceiling. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t over yet,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;The battle&rsquo;s never over.&rdquo;</p>
