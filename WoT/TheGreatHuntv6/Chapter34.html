<h4><em>The Wheel Weaves</em></h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
first light of morning already pearled the sky by
the time Thom Merrilin found himself trudging back to The Bunch of
Grapes. Even where the halls and taverns lay thickest, there was a
brief time when the Foregate lay quiet, gathering its breath. In
his present mood, Thom would not have noticed if the empty street
had been on fire.</p>

<p>Some of Barthanes&rsquo;s guests had insisted on keeping
him long after most had gone, long after Barthanes had taken
himself to bed. It had been his own fault for leaving <em>The Great
Hunt of the Horn</em>, changing to the sort of tales he told and
songs he sang in the villages, &lsquo;Mara and the Three Foolish Kings&rsquo;
and <em>How Susa Tamed Jain Farstrider</em> and stories of Anla the
Wise Councilor. He had meant the choices to be a private comment on
their stupidity, never dreaming any of them might listen, much less
be intrigued. Intrigued in a way. They had demanded more of the
same, but they had laughed in the wrong places, at the wrong
things. They had laughed at him, too, apparently thinking he would
not notice, or else that a full purse stuffed in his pocket would
heal any wounds. He had almost thrown it away twice already.</p>

<p>The heavy purse burning his pocket and pride was not
the only reason for his mood, nor even the nobles&rsquo; contempt. They
had asked questions about Rand, not even bothering to be subtle
with a mere gleeman. Why was Rand in Cairhien? Why had an Andoran
lord taken him, a gleeman, aside? Too many questions. He was not
sure his answers had been clever enough. His reflexes for the Great
Game were rusty.</p>

<p>Before turning toward The Bunch of Grapes, he had
gone to The Great Tree; it was not difficult to find where someone
was staying in Cairhien, if you pressed a palm or two with silver.
He was still not sure what he had intended to say. Rand was gone
with his friends, and the Aes Sedai. It left a feeling of something
not done. <em>The boy&rsquo;s on his own, now. Burn me, I&rsquo;m out of
it!</em></p>

<p>He strode through the common room, empty as it seldom
was, and took the steps two at a time. At least, he tried to; his
right leg did not bend well, and he nearly fell. Muttering to
himself, he climbed the rest of the way at a slower pace, and
opened the door to his room softly, so as not to wake Dena.</p>

<p>Despite himself, he smiled when he saw her lying on
the bed with her face turned to the wall, still in her dress. <em>
Fell asleep waiting for me. Fool girl</em>. But it was a kindly
thought; he was not sure there was anything she would do that he
would not forgive or excuse. Deciding on the spur of the moment
that tonight was the night he&rsquo;d let her perform for the first
time, he lowered his harp case to the floor and put a hand on her
shoulder, to wake her and tell her.</p>

<p>She rolled limply onto her back, staring up at him,
glazed eyes open wide above the gash across her throat. The side of
the bed that had been hidden by her body was dark and sodden.</p>

<p>Thom&rsquo;s stomach heaved; if his throat had not been so
tight he could not breathe, he would have vomited, or screamed, or
both.</p>

<p>He had only the creaking of wardrobe doors for
warning. He spun, knives coming out of his sleeves and leaving his
hands in the same motion. The first blade took the throat of a fat,
balding man with a dagger in his hand; the man stumbled back, blood
bubbling around his clutching fingers as he tried to cry out.</p>

<p>Spinning on his bad leg threw Thom&rsquo;s other blade off,
though; the knife stuck in the right shoulder of a heavily muscled
man with scars on his face, who was climbing out of the other
wardrobe. The big man&rsquo;s knife dropped from a hand that suddenly
would not do what he wanted, and he lumbered for the door.</p>

<p>Before he could take a second step, Thom produced
another knife and slashed him across the back of his leg. The big
man yelled and stumbled, and Thom seized a handful of greasy hair,
slamming his face against the wall beside the door; the man
screamed again as the knife hilt sticking out of his shoulder hit
the door.</p>

<p>Thom thrust the blade in his hand to within an inch
of the man&rsquo;s dark eye. The scars on the big man&rsquo;s face gave him a
hard look, but he stared at the point without blinking and did not
move a muscle. The fat man, lying half in the wardrobe, kicked a
last kick and was still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before I kill you,&rdquo; Thom said, &ldquo;tell me. Why?&rdquo; His
voice was quiet, numb; he felt numb inside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Great Game,&rdquo; the man said quickly. His accent
was of the streets, and his clothes as well, but they were a shade
too fine, too unworn; he had more coin to spend than any Foregater
should. &ldquo;Nothing against you personal, you see? It is just the
Game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Game? I&rsquo;m not mixed up in <em>Daes Dae&rsquo;mar!</em>
Who would want to kill me for the Great Game?&rdquo; The man hesitated.
Thom moved his blade closer. If the fellow blinked, his eyelashes
would brush the point. &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Barthanes,&rdquo; came the hoarse answer. &ldquo;Lord Barthanes.
We would not have killed you. Barthanes wants information. We just
wanted to find out what you know. There can be gold in it for you.
A nice, fat golden crown for what you know. Maybe two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Liar! I was in Barthanes&rsquo;s manor last night, as
close to him as I am to you. If he wanted anything of me, I&rsquo;d never
have left alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you, we have been looking for you, or anyone
who knows about this Andoran lord, for days. I never heard your
name until last night, downstairs. Lord Barthanes is generous. It
could be five crowns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man tried to pull his head away from the knife in
Thom&rsquo;s hand, and Thom pushed him harder against the wall. &ldquo;What
Andoran lord?&rdquo; But he knew. The Light help him, he knew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand. Of House al&rsquo;Thor. Tall. Young. A blademaster,
or at least he wears the sword. I know he came to see you. Him and
an Ogier, and you talked. Tell me what you know. I might even throw
in a crown or two, myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You fool,&rdquo; Thom breathed. <em>Dena died for this?
Oh, Light, she&rsquo;s dead</em>. He felt as if he wanted to cry. &ldquo;The
boy&rsquo;s a shepherd.&rdquo; <em>A shepherd in a fancy coat, with Aes Sedai
around him like bees around honeyroses</em>. &ldquo;Just a shepherd.&rdquo; He
tightened his grip in the man&rsquo;s hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait! Wait! You can make more than any five crowns,
or even ten. A hundred, more like. Every House wants to know about
this Rand al&rsquo;Thor. Two or three have approached me. With what you
know, and my knowing who wants to know it, we could both fill our
pockets. And there has been a woman, a lady, I have seen more than
once while asking after him. If we can find out who she is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;why, we could sell that, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made one real mistake in it all,&rdquo; Thom
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mistake?&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s far hand was beginning to slide
down toward his belt. No doubt he had another dagger there. Thom
ignored it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should never have touched the girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man&rsquo;s hand darted for his belt, then he gave one
convulsive start as Thom&rsquo;s knife went home.</p>

<p>Thom let him fall over away from the door and stood a
moment before bending tiredly to tug his blades free. The door
banged open, and he whirled with a snarl on his face.</p>

<p>Zera jerked back, a hand to her throat, staring at
him. &ldquo;That fool Ella just told me,&rdquo; she said unsteadily, &ldquo;that two
of Barthanes&rsquo;s men were asking after you last night, and with what
I&rsquo;ve heard this morning&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I thought you said you didn&rsquo;t play in
the Game anymore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They found me,&rdquo; he said wearily.</p>

<p>Her eyes dropped from his face and widened as they
took in the bodies of the two men. Hastily she stepped into the
room, shutting the door behind her. &ldquo;This is bad, Thom. You&rsquo;ll have
to leave Cairhien.&rdquo; Her gaze fell on the bed, and her breath
caught. &ldquo;Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, Thom, I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot leave yet, Zera.&rdquo; He hesitated, then
tenderly drew a blanket over Dena, covering her face. &ldquo;I have
another man to kill, first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The innkeeper gave herself a shake and pulled her
eyes away from the bed. Her voice was more than a little breathy.
&ldquo;If you mean Barthanes, you&rsquo;re too late. Everybody&rsquo;s talking about
it already. He is dead. His servants found him this morning, torn
to pieces in his bedchamber. The only way they knew it was him was
his head stuck on a spike over the fireplace.&rdquo; She laid a hand on
his arm. &ldquo;Thom, you can&rsquo;t hide that you were there last night, not
from anybody who wants to know. Add these two in, and there&rsquo;s
nobody in Cairhien who won&rsquo;t believe you were involved.&rdquo; There was
a slight questioning note in her last words, as if she, too, were
wondering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter, I suppose,&rdquo; he said dully. He
could not stop looking down at the blanket-covered shape on the
bed. &ldquo;Perhaps I will go back to Andor. To Caemlyn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She took his shoulders, turning him away from the
bed. &ldquo;You men,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;always thinking with either your
muscles or your hearts, and never your heads. Caemlyn is as bad as
Cairhien, for you. Either place, you&rsquo;ll end up dead, or in prison.
Do you think she&rsquo;d want that? If you want to honor her memory, stay
alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you take care of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He could not say it.
<em>Growing old</em>, he thought. <em>Going soft</em>. He pulled
the heavy purse from his pocket and folded her hands around it.
&ldquo;This should take care of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;everything. And help when they
start asking questions about me, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will see to everything,&rdquo; she said gently. &ldquo;You
must go, Thom. Now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He nodded reluctantly, and slowly began stuffing a
few things in a set of saddlebags. While he worked, Zera got her
first close look at the fat man sprawled partway in the wardrobe,
and she gave a loud gasp. He looked at her inquiringly; as long as
he had known her, she had never been one to go faint over
blood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These aren&rsquo;t Barthanes&rsquo;s men, Thom. At least, that
one isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; She nodded toward the fat man. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the worst kept
secret in Cairhien that he works for House Riatin. For
Galldrian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Galldrian,&rdquo; he said flatly. <em>What has that bloody
shepherd gotten me into? What have the Aes Sedai gotten us both
into? But it was Galldrian&rsquo;s men murdered her</em>.</p>

<p>There must have been something of his thoughts on his
face. Zera said sharply, &ldquo;Dena wants you alive, you fool! You try
to kill the King, and you&rsquo;ll be dead before you get within a
hundred spans of him, if you come that close!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A roar came from the city walls, as if half of
Cairhien were shouting. Frowning, Thom peered from his window.
Beyond the top of the gray walls above the rooftops of the
Foregate, a thick column of smoke was rising into the sky. Far
beyond the walls. Beside the first black pillar, a few gray
tendrils quickly grew into another, and more wisps appeared further
on. He estimated the distance and took a deep breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you had better think about leaving, too. It
looks as if someone is firing the granaries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have lived through riots before. Go now, Thom.&rdquo;
With a last look at Dena&rsquo;s shrouded form, he gathered his things,
but as he started to leave, Zera spoke again. &ldquo;You have a dangerous
look in your eyes, Thom Merrilin. Imagine Dena sitting here, alive
and hale. Think what she would say. Would she let you go off and
get yourself killed to no purpose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only an old gleeman,&rdquo; he said from the door.
<em>And Rand al&rsquo;Thor is only a shepherd, but we both do what we
must</em>. &ldquo;Who could I possibly be dangerous to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he pulled the door to, hiding her, hiding Dena, a
mirthless, wolfish grin came onto his face. His leg hurt, but he
barely felt it as he hurried purposefully down the stairs and out
of the inn.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Padan Fain reined in his horse atop a hill above
Falme, in one of the few sparse thickets remaining on the hills
outside the town. The packhorse bearing his precious burden bumped
his leg, and he kicked it in the ribs without looking; the animal
snorted and jerked back to the end of the lead he had tied to his
saddle. The woman had not wanted to give up her horse, no more than
any of the Darkfriends who had followed him had wanted to be left
alone in the hills with the Trollocs, without Fain&rsquo;s protecting
presence. He had solved both problems easily. Meat in a Trolloc
cookpot had no need of a horse. The woman&rsquo;s companions had been
shaken by the journey along the Ways, to a Waygate outside a
long-abandoned <em>stedding</em> on Toman Head, and watching the
Trollocs prepare their dinner had made the surviving Darkfriends
extremely biddable.</p>

<p>From the edge of the trees, Fain studied the unwalled
town and sneered. One short merchant train was rumbling in among
the stables and horse lots and wagon yards that bordered the town,
while another rumbled out, raising little dust from dirt packed by
many years of such traffic. The men driving the wagons and the few
riding beside them were all local men by their clothing, yet the
mounted men, at least, had swords on baldrics, and even a few
spears and bows. The soldiers he saw, and there were few, did not
seem to be watching the armed men they had supposedly
conquered.</p>

<p>He had learned something of these people, these
Seanchan, in his day and a night on Toman Head. At least, as much
as the defeated folk knew. It was never hard to find someone alone,
and they always answered questions properly put. Men gathered more
information on the invaders, as if they actually believed they
would eventually do something with what they knew, but they
sometimes tried to hold back. Women, by and large, seemed
interested in going on with their lives whoever their rulers were,
yet they noted details men did not, and they talked more quickly
once they stopped screaming. Children talked the quickest of all,
but they seldom said much that was worthwhile.</p>

<p>He had discarded three quarters of what he had heard
as nonsense and rumors growing into fables, but he took some of
those conclusions back, now. Anyone at all could enter Falme, it
appeared. With a start, he saw the truth of a little more
&ldquo;nonsense&rdquo; as twenty soldiers rode out of the town. He could not
make out their mounts clearly, but they were certainly not horses.
They ran with a fluid grace, and their dark skins seemed to have a
glint in the morning sun, as of scales. He craned his neck to watch
them disappear inland, then booted his horse toward the town.</p>

<p>The local folk among the stables and parked wagons
and fenced horse lots gave him no more than a glance or two. He had
no interest in them, either; he rode on into the town, onto its
cobblestone streets sloping down to the harbor. He could see the
harbor clearly, and the large, oddly shaped Seanchan ships anchored
there. No one bothered him as he searched streets that were neither
crowded nor empty. There were more Seanchan soldiers here. The
people hurried about their business with eyes down, bowing whenever
soldiers passed, but the Seanchan paid them no mind. It all seemed
peaceful on the surface, despite the armored Seanchan in the
streets and the ships in the harbor, but Fain could sense the
tension underneath. He always did well where men were tense and
afraid.</p>

<p>He came to a large house with more than a dozen
soldiers standing guard before it. Fain stopped and dismounted.
Except for one obvious officer, most wore armor of unrelieved
black, and their helmets made him think of locusts&rsquo; heads. Two
leathery-skinned beasts with three eyes and horny beaks instead of
mouths flanked the front door, squatting like crouching frogs; the
soldier standing by each of the creatures had three eyes painted on
the breast of his armor. Fain eyed the blue-bordered banner
flapping above the roof, the spread-winged hawk clutching lightning
bolts, and chortled inside himself.</p>

<p>Women went in and out of a house across the street,
women linked by silver leashes, but he ignored them. He knew about
<em>damane</em> from the villagers. They might be of some use
later, but not now.</p>

<p>The soldiers were looking at him, especially the
officer, whose armor was all gold and red and green.</p>

<p>Forcing an ingratiating smile onto his face, Fain
made himself bow deeply. &ldquo;My lords, I have something here that will
interest your Great Lord. I assure you, he will want to see it, and
me, personally.&rdquo; He gestured to the squarish shape on his
packhorse, still wrapped in the huge, striped blanket in which his
people had found it.</p>

<p>The officer stared him up and down. &ldquo;You sound a
foreigner to this land. Have you taken the oaths?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I obey, await, and will serve,&rdquo; Fain replied
smoothly. Everyone he had questioned spoke of the oaths, though
none had understood what they meant. If these people wanted oaths,
he was prepared to swear anything. He had long since lost count of
the oaths he had taken.</p>

<p>The officer motioned two of his men to see what was
under the blanket. Surprised grunts at the weight as they lifted it
down from the packsaddle turned to gasps when they stripped the
blanket away. The officer stared with no expression on his face at
the silver-worked golden chest resting on the cobblestones, then
looked at Fain. &ldquo;A gift fit for the Empress herself. You will come
with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the soldiers searched Fain roughly, but he
endured it in silence, noting that the officer and the two soldiers
who took up the chest surrendered their swords and daggers before
going inside. Anything he could learn of these people, however
small, might help, though he was confident of his plan already. He
was always confident, but never more than where lords feared an
assassin&rsquo;s knife from their own followers.</p>

<p>As they went through the door, the officer frowned at
him, and for a moment Fain wondered why. <em>Of course. The
beasts</em>. Whatever they were, they were certainly no worse than
Trollocs, nothing at all beside a Myrddraal, and he had not given
them a second look. It was too late to pretend to be afraid of them
now. But the Seanchan said nothing, only led him deeper into the
house.</p>

<p>And so Fain found himself on his face, in a room bare
of furnishings except for folding screens that hid its walls, while
the officer told the High Lord Turak of him and his offering.
Servants brought a table on which to set the chest so the High Lord
would have no need to stoop; all Fain saw of them were scurrying
slippers. He bided his time impatiently. Eventually there would
come a time when he was not the one to bow.</p>

<p>Then the soldiers were dismissed, and Fain told to
rise. He did so slowly, studying both the High Lord, with his
shaven head and his long fingernails and his blue silk robe
brocaded with blossoms, and the man who stood beside him with the
unshaven half of his pale hair in a long braid. Fain was sure the
fellow in green was only a servant, however great, but servants
could be useful, especially if they stood high in their master&rsquo;s
sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A marvelous gift.&rdquo; Turak&rsquo;s eyes lifted from the
chest to Fain. A scent of roses wafted from the High Lord. &ldquo;Yet the
question asks itself; how did one like you come by a chest many
lesser lords could not afford? Are you a thief?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fain tugged at his worn, none too clean coat. &ldquo;It is
sometimes necessary for a man to appear less than he is, High Lord.
My present shabbiness allowed me to bring this to you unmolested.
This chest is old, High Lord&mdash;as old as the Age of Legends&mdash;and within it lies a treasure such as few eyes have ever
seen. Soon&mdash;very soon, High Lord&mdash;I will be able to
open it, and give you that which will enable you to take this land
as far as you wish, to the Spine of the World, the Aiel Waste, the
lands beyond. Nothing will stand against you, High Lord, once I&mdash;&rdquo; He cut off as Turak began running his long-nailed fingers
over the chest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen chests such as this, chests from the Age
of Legends,&rdquo; the High Lord said, &ldquo;though none so fine. They are
meant to be opened only by those who know the pattern, but I&mdash;ah!&rdquo; He pressed among the ornate whorls and bosses, there was a
sharp click, and he lifted back the lid. A flicker of what might
have been disappointment passed across his face.</p>

<p>Fain bit the inside of his mouth till blood came to
keep from snarling. It lessened his bargaining position that he was
not the one who had opened the chest. Still, all the rest could go
as he had planned if he could only make himself be patient. But he
had been patient so long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are treasure from the Age of Legends?&rdquo; Turak
said, lifting out the curled Horn in one hand and the curved dagger
with the ruby in its golden hilt in the other. Fain clutched his
hands in fists at his sides so he would not grab the dagger. &ldquo;The
Age of Legends,&rdquo; Turak repeated softly, tracing the silver script
inlaid around the golden bell of the Horn with the tip of the
dagger&rsquo;s blade. His brows rose in startlement, the first open
expression Fain had seen from him, but in the next instant Turak&rsquo;s
face was as smooth as ever. &ldquo;Do you have any idea what this
is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Horn of Valere, High Lord,&rdquo; Fain said smoothly,
pleased to see the mouth of the man with the braid drop open. Turak
only nodded as if to himself.</p>

<p>The High Lord turned away. Fain blinked and opened
his mouth, then, at a sharp gesture from the yellow-haired man,
followed without speaking.</p>

<p>It was another room with all the original furnishings
gone, replaced by folding screens and a single chair facing a tall
round cabinet. Still holding the Horn and the dagger, Turak looked
at the cabinet, then away. He said nothing, but the other Seanchan
snapped quick orders, and in moments men in plain woolen robes
appeared through a door behind the screens bearing another small
table. A young woman with hair so pale it was almost white came
behind them, her arms full of small stands of polished wood in
various sizes and shapes. Her garment was white silk, and so thin
that Fain could see her body clearly through it, but he had eyes
only for the dagger. The Horn was a means to an end, but the dagger
was a part of him.</p>

<p>Turak briefly touched one of the wooden stands the
girl held, and she placed it on the center of the table. The men
turned the chair to face it under the direction of the man with the
braid. The lower servants&rsquo; hair hung to their shoulders. They
scurried out with bows that almost put their heads on their
knees.</p>

<p>Placing the Horn on the stand so that it stood
upright, Turak laid the dagger on the table in front of it and went
to sit in the chair.</p>

<p>Fain could stand it no longer. He reached for the
dagger.</p>

<p>The yellow-haired man caught his wrist in a crushing
grip. &ldquo;Unshaven dog! Know that the hand that touches the property
of the High Lord unbidden is cut off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is mine,&rdquo; Fain growled. <em>Patience! So
long</em>.</p>

<p>Turak, lounging back in the chair, lifted one
blue-lacquered fingernail, and Fain was pulled out of the way so
the High Lord could view the Horn unobstructed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yours?&rdquo; Turak said. &ldquo;Inside a chest you could not
open? If you interest me sufficiently, I may give you the dagger.
Even if it is from the Age of Legends, I have no interest in such
as that. Before all else, you will answer me a question. Why have
you brought the Horn of Valere to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fain eyed the dagger longingly a moment more, then
jerked his wrist free and rubbed it as he bowed. &ldquo;That you may
sound it, High Lord. Then you may take all of this land, if you
wish. All of the world. You may break the White Tower and grind the
Aes Sedai to dust, for even their powers cannot stop heroes come
back from the dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> am to sound it.&rdquo; Turak&rsquo;s tone was flat.
&ldquo;And break the White Tower. Again, why? You claim to obey, await,
and serve, but this is a land of oath-breakers. Why do you give
your land to me? Do you have some private quarrel with these&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;women?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fain tried to make his voice convincing. <em>Patient,
like a worm boring from within</em>. &ldquo;High Lord, my family has
passed down a tradition, generation upon generation. We served the
High King, Artur Paendrag Tanreall, and when he was murdered by the
witches of Tar Valon, we did not abandon our oaths. When others
warred and tore apart what Artur Hawkwing had made, we held to our
swearing, and suffered for it, but held to it still. This is our
tradition, High Lord, handed father to son, and mother to daughter,
down all the years since the High King was murdered. That we await
the return of the armies Artur Hawkwing sent across the Aryth
Ocean, that we await the return of Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s blood to
destroy the White Tower and take back what was the High King&rsquo;s. And
when the Hawkwing&rsquo;s blood returns, we will serve and advise, as we
did for the High King. High Lord, except for its border, the banner
that flies over this roof is the banner of Luthair, the son Artur
Paendrag Tanreall sent with his armies across the ocean.&rdquo; Fain
dropped to his knees, giving a good imitation of being overwhelmed.
&ldquo;High Lord, I wish only to serve and advise the blood of the High
King.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turak was silent so long that Fain began to wonder if
he needed further convincing; he was ready with more, as much as
was required. Finally, though, the High Lord spoke. &ldquo;You seem to
know what none, neither the high nor the low, has spoken since
sighting this land. The people here speak it as one rumor among
ten, but you know. I can see it in your eyes, hear it in your
voice. I could almost think you were sent to entangle me in a trap.
But who, possessing the Horn of Valere, would use it so? None of
those of the Blood who came with the <em>Hailene</em> could have
had the Horn, for the legend says it was hidden in this land. And
surely any lord of this land would use it against me rather than
put it in my hands. How did you come to possess the Horn of Valere?
Do you claim to be a hero, as in the legend? Have you done valorous
deeds?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am no hero, High Lord.&rdquo; Fain ventured a
self-deprecating smile, but Turak&rsquo;s face did not alter, and he let
it go. &ldquo;The Horn was found by an ancestor of mine during the
turmoil after the High King&rsquo;s death. He knew how to open the chest,
but that secret died with him in the War of the Hundred Years, that
rent Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s empire, so that all we who followed him knew
was that the Horn lay within and we must keep it safe until the
High King&rsquo;s blood returned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Almost could I believe you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Believe, High Lord. Once you sound the Horn&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not ruin what convincing you have managed to do.
I shall not sound the Horn of Valere. When I return to Seanchan, I
shall present it to the Empress as the chiefest of my trophies.
Perhaps the Empress will sound it herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, High Lord,&rdquo; Fain protested, &ldquo;you must&mdash;&rdquo;
He found himself lying on his side, his head ringing. Only when his
eyes cleared did he see the man with the pale braid rubbing his
knuckles and realize what had happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some words,&rdquo; the fellow said softly, &ldquo;are never used
to the High Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fain decided how the man was going to die.</p>

<p>Turak looked from Fain to the Horn as placidly as if
he had seen nothing. &ldquo;Perhaps I will give you to the Empress along
with the Horn of Valere. She might find you amusing, a man who
claims his family held true where all others broke their oaths or
forgot them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fain hid his sudden elation in the act of climbing
back to his feet. He had not even known of the existence of an
Empress until Turak mentioned her, but access to a ruler again&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that opened new paths, new plans. Access to a ruler with the
might of the Seanchan beneath her and the Horn of Valere in her
hands. Much better than making this Turak a Great King. He could
wait for some parts of his plan. <em>Softly. Mustn&rsquo;t let him know
how much you want it. After so long, a little more patience will
not hurt</em>. &ldquo;As the High Lord wishes,&rdquo; he said, trying to sound
like a man who only wanted to serve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem almost eager,&rdquo; Turak said, and Fain barely
suppressed a wince. &ldquo;I will tell you why I will not sound the Horn
of Valere, or even keep it, and perhaps that will cure your
eagerness. I do not wish a gift of mine to offend the Empress by
his actions; if your eagerness cannot be cured, it will never be
satisfied, for you will never leave these shores. Do you know that
whoever blows the Horn of Valere is linked to it thereafter? That
so long as he or she lives, it is no more than a horn to any
other?&rdquo; He did not sound as if he expected answers, and in any
case, he did not pause for them. &ldquo;I stand twelfth in line of
succession to the Crystal Throne. If I kept the Horn of Valere, all
between myself and the throne would think I meant to be first
hereafter, and while the Empress, of course, wishes that we contend
with one another so that the strongest and most cunning will follow
her, she currently favors her second daughter, and she would not
look well on any threat to Tuon. If I sounded it, even if I then
laid this land at her feet, and every woman in the White Tower
leashed, the Empress, may she live forever, would surely believe I
meant to be more than merely her heir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fain stopped himself short of suggesting how possible
that would be with the aid of the Horn. Something in the High
Lord&rsquo;s voice suggested&mdash;as hard as Fain found it to believe&mdash;that he actually meant his wish for her to live forever.
<em>I must be patient. A worm in the root</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Empress&rsquo;s Listeners may be anywhere,&rdquo; Turak
continued. &ldquo;They may be anyone. Huan was born and raised in the
House of Aladon, and his family for eleven generations before him,
yet even he could be a Listener.&rdquo; The man with the braid half made
a protesting gesture, before jerking himself back to stillness.
&ldquo;Even a high lord or a high lady can find their deepest secrets
known to Listeners, can wake to find themselves already handed over
to the Seekers for Truth. Truth is always difficult to find, but
the Seekers spare no pain in their search, and they will search as
long as they think there is need. They make great efforts not to
allow a high lord or high lady to die in their care, of course, for
no man&rsquo;s hand may slay one in whose veins flows the blood of Artur
Hawkwing. If the Empress must order such a death, the unfortunate
one is placed alive in a silken bag, and that bag hung over the
side of the Tower of the Ravens and left there until it rots away.
No such care would be taken for one such as you. At the Court of
the Nine Moons, in Seandar, one such as you could be given to the
Seekers for a shift of your eye, for a misspoken word, for a
whim. Are you still eager?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fain managed a tremble in his knees. &ldquo;I wish only to
serve and advise, High Lord. I know much that may be useful.&rdquo; This
court of Seandar sounded a place where his plans and skills would
find fertile soil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Until I sail back to Seanchan, you will amuse me
with your tales of your family and its tradition. It is a relief to
find a second man in this Light-forsaken land who can amuse me,
even if you both tell lies, as I suspect. You may leave me.&rdquo; No
other word was spoken, but the girl with the nearly white hair and
the almost-transparent robe appeared on quick feet to kneel with
downcast head beside the High Lord, offering a single steaming cup
on a lacquered tray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;High Lord,&rdquo; Fain said. The man with the braid, Huan,
took hold of his arm, but he pulled loose. Huan&rsquo;s mouth tightened
angrily as Fain made his deepest bow yet. <em>I will kill him
slowly, yes</em>. &ldquo;High Lord, there are those who follow me. They
mean to take the Horn of Valere. Darkfriends and worse, High Lord,
and they cannot be more than a day or two behind me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turak took a sip of black liquid from the thin cup
balanced on longnailed fingertips. &ldquo;Few Darkfriends remain in
Seanchan. Those who survive the Seekers for Truth meet the axe of
the headsman. It might be amusing to meet a Darkfriend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;High Lord, they are dangerous. They have Trollocs
with them. They are led by one who calls himself Rand al&rsquo;Thor. A
young man, but vile in the Shadow beyond belief, with a lying,
devious tongue. In many places he has claimed to be many things,
but always the Trollocs come when he is there, High Lord. Always
the Trollocs come&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and kill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trollocs,&rdquo; Turak mused. &ldquo;There were no Trollocs in
Seanchan. But the Armies of the Night had other allies. Other
things. I have often wondered if a <em>grolm</em> could kill a
Trolloc. I will have watch kept for your Trollocs and your
Darkfriends, if they are not another lie. This land wearies me with
boredom.&rdquo; He sighed and inhaled the fumes from his cup.</p>

<p>Fain let the grimacing Huan pull him out of the room,
hardly even listening to the snarled lecture on what would happen
if he ever again failed to leave Lord Turak&rsquo;s presence when given
permission to do so. He barely noticed when he was pushed into the
street with a coin and instructions to return on the morrow. Rand
al&rsquo;Thor was his, now. <em>I will see him dead at last. And then the
world will pay for what was done to me</em>.</p>

<p>Giggling under his breath, he led his horses down
into the town in search of an inn.</p>
