<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">S</span>itting
cross-legged on her bed in her white dress,
Egwene made three tiny balls of light weave patterns above her
hands. She was not supposed to do this without at least one the
Accepted to supervise, but Nynaeve, glaring and striding up and
down in front of the small fireplace, did after all wear the
Serpent ring given to the Accepted, and her white dress had the
colored rings encircling the hem, even if she was not allowed to
try to teach anyone yet. And Egwene had found over these last
thirteen weeks that she could not resist. She knew how easy it was
to touch <em>saidar</em> now. She could always feel it there,
waiting for her, like the smell of perfume or the feel of silk,
drawing her, drawing her. And once she did touch it, she could
rarely stop from channeling, or at least trying to. She failed
almost as often as she succeeded, but that was only another spur to
keep on.</p>

<p>It often frightened her. How much she wanted to
channel frightened her, and how drab and dreary she felt when she
was not channeling, compared to when she was. She wanted to drink
it all in, despite the cautions about burning herself out, and that
wanting frightened her most of all. Sometimes she wished she had
never come to Tar Valon. But the fright could not make her stop for
long, any more than the fear of being caught by an Aes Sedai or by
any of the Accepted beside Nynaeve.</p>

<p>It was safe enough here, though, in her own room. Min
was there, sitting on the three-legged stool watching her, but she
knew Min well enough now to know Min would never report her. She
thought she was lucky to have made two good friends since coming to
Tar Valon.</p>

<p>It was a little, windowless room, as all novices&rsquo;
rooms were. Three short paces took Nynaeve from wall to
white-plastered wall; Nynaeve&rsquo;s own room was much larger, but since
she had made no friends among the other Accepted, she came to
Egwene&rsquo;s room when she needed someone to talk to, even as now when
she did not talk at all. The tiny fire on the narrow hearth handily
kept the first chill of approaching autumn at bay, though Egwene
was sure it would not serve so well when winter came. A small table
for study completed the furnishings, and her belongings hung neatly
on a row of pegs on the wall or sat on the short shelf above the
table. Novices were usually kept too busy to spend time in their
rooms, but today was a freeday, only the third since she and
Nynaeve had come to the White Tower.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Else was making calf&rsquo;s eyes at Galad today while he
was working with the Warders,&rdquo; Min said, rocking the stool on two
legs.</p>

<p>The small balls faltered for an instant above
Egwene&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;She can look at whoever she wants,&rdquo; Egwene said
casually. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine why I would be interested.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No reason, I suppose. He is awfully handsome, if you
don&rsquo;t mind him being so rigid. Very nice to look at, especially
with his shirt off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The balls spun furiously. &ldquo;I certainly have no desire
to look at Galad, with or without his shirt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t tease you,&rdquo; Min said contritely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sorry for that. But you do like to look at him&mdash;don&rsquo;t grimace
at me like that&mdash;and so does nearly every woman in the White
Tower who isn&rsquo;t a Red. I&rsquo;ve seen Aes Sedai down at the practice
yards when he&rsquo;s working forms, especially Greens. Checking on their
Warders, they say, but I don&rsquo;t see so many when Galad isn&rsquo;t there.
Even the cooks and maids come out to watch him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The balls stopped dead, and for a moment Egwene
stared at them. They vanished. Suddenly she giggled. &ldquo;He is
good-looking, isn&rsquo;t he? Even when he walks he looks as if he&rsquo;s
dancing.&rdquo; The color in her cheeks deepened. &ldquo;I know I shouldn&rsquo;t
stare at him, but I can&rsquo;t help myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t either,&rdquo; Min said, &ldquo;and I can see what he is
like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if he is good&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egwene, Galad is so good he&rsquo;d make you tear your
hair out. He&rsquo;d hurt a person because he had to serve a greater
good. He wouldn&rsquo;t even notice who was hurt, because he&rsquo;d be so
intent on the other, but if he did, he would expect them to
understand and think it was all well and right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you know,&rdquo; Egwene said. She had seen Min&rsquo;s
ability to look at people and read all sorts of things about them;
Min did not tell everything she saw, and she did not always see
anything, but there had been enough for Egwene to believe. She
glanced at Nynaeve&mdash;the other woman was still pacing,
muttering to herself&mdash;then reached for <em>saidar</em> again
and resumed her juggling in a desultory fashion.</p>

<p>Min shrugged. &ldquo;I guess I might as well tell you. He
didn&rsquo;t even notice what Else was doing. He asked her if she knew
whether you might be walking the South Garden after supper, since
today is a freeday. I felt sorry for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Else,&rdquo; Egwene murmured, and the balls of light
became more lively above her hands. Min laughed.</p>

<p>The door banged open, caught by the wind. Egwene gave
a yelp and let the balls vanish before she saw it was only
Elayne.</p>

<p>The golden-haired Daughter-Heir of Andor pushed the
door shut and hung up her cloak on a peg. &ldquo;I just heard,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;The rumors are true. King Galldrian is dead. That makes it a war
of succession.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min snorted. &ldquo;Civil war. War of succession. A lot of
silly names for the same thing. Do you mind if we don&rsquo;t talk about
it? That&rsquo;s all we hear. War in Cairhien. War on Toman Head. They
may have caught the false Dragon in Saldaea, but there&rsquo;s still war
in Tear. Most of it is rumors, anyway. Yesterday, I heard one of
the cooks saying she&rsquo;d heard Artur Hawkwing was marching on
Tanchico. Artur Hawkwing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you did not want to talk about it,&rdquo; Egwene
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw Logain,&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;He was sitting on a
bench in the Inner Court, crying. He ran when he saw me. I cannot
help feeling sorry for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better he cries than the rest of us, Elayne,&rdquo; Min
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what he is,&rdquo; Elayne said calmly. &ldquo;Or rather,
what he was. He isn&rsquo;t anymore, and I can feel sorry for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene slumped back against the wall. <em>Rand</em>.
Logain always made her think of Rand. She had not dreamed about him
in months, now, not the kind of dreams she had had on the <em>River
Queen</em>. Anaiya still made her write down everything she
dreamed, and the Aes Sedai checked them for signs, or connections
to events, but there was never anything about Rand except dreams
that, Anaiya said, meant she missed him. Oddly, she felt almost as
if he were not there any longer, as if he had ceased to exist,
along with her dreams, a few weeks after reaching the White Tower.
<em>And I sit thinking about how nicely Galad walks</em>, she
thought bitterly. <em>Rand has to be all right. If he&rsquo;d been caught
and gentled, I&rsquo;d have heard something</em>.</p>

<p>That sent a chill through her, as it never failed to
do, the thought of Rand being gentled, Rand weeping and wanting to
die as Logain did.</p>

<p>Elayne sat down beside her on the bed, tucking her
feet up under her. &ldquo;If you are mooning over Galad, Egwene, you will
have no sympathy from me. I&rsquo;ll have Nynaeve dose you with one of
those horrible concoctions she&rsquo;s always talking about.&rdquo; She frowned
at Nynaeve, who had taken no notice of her entrance. &ldquo;What is the
matter with her? Don&rsquo;t tell me she has started sighing after Galad,
too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t bother her.&rdquo; Min leaned toward the two of
them and lowered her voice. &ldquo;That skinny Accepted Irella told her
she was as clumsy as a cow and had half the Talents, and Nynaeve
clouted her ear.&rdquo; Elayne winced. &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; Min murmured. &ldquo;They had
her up to Sheriam&rsquo;s study before you could blink, and she hasn&rsquo;t
been fit to live with since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Apparently Min had not dropped her voice enough, for
there was a growl from Nynaeve. Suddenly the door whipped open once
more, and a gale howled into the room. It did not ruffle the
blankets on Egwene&rsquo;s bed, but Min and the stool toppled, to roll
against the wall. Immediately the wind died, and Nynaeve stood with
a stricken look on her face.</p>

<p>Egwene hurried to the door and peeked out. The
noonday sun was burning off the last reminders of last night&rsquo;s
rainstorm. The still-damp balcony around the Novices&rsquo; Court was
empty, the long row of doors to novices&rsquo; rooms all shut. The
novices who had taken advantage of the freeday to enjoy themselves
in the gardens were no doubt catching up on their sleep. No one
could have seen. She closed the door and took her place beside
Elayne again as Nynaeve helped Min to her feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Min,&rdquo; Nynaeve said in a tight voice.
&ldquo;Sometimes my temper&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I can&rsquo;t ask you to forgive me, not for
this.&rdquo; She took a deep breath. &ldquo;If you want to report me to
Sheriam, I will understand. I deserve it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene wished she had not heard that admission;
Nynaeve could grow prickly over such things. Searching for
something on which to focus, something Nynaeve could believe she
had had her attention on, she found herself touching <em>
saidar</em> once more, and began juggling the balls of light again.
Elayne quickly joined her; Egwene saw the glow form around the
Daughter-Heir even before three tiny balls appeared above her
hands. They began to pass the little glowing spheres back and forth
in increasingly intricate patterns. Sometimes one winked out as one
girl or the other failed to maintain it as it came to her, then
winked back a little altered in color or size.</p>

<p>The One Power filled Egwene with life. She smelled
the faint rose aroma of soap from Elayne&rsquo;s morning bath. She could
feel the rough plaster of the walls, the smooth stones of the
floor, as well as she could the bed where she sat. She could hear
Min and Nynaeve breathe, much less their quiet words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it comes to forgiving,&rdquo; Min said, &ldquo;maybe you
should forgive me. You have a temper, and I have a big mouth. I
will forgive you if you forgive me.&rdquo; With murmurs of &ldquo;forgiven&rdquo;
that sounded meant on both sides, the two women hugged. &ldquo;But if you
do it again,&rdquo; Min said with a laugh, &ldquo;I might clout <em>your</em>
ear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Next time,&rdquo; Nynaeve replied, &ldquo;I will throw something
at you.&rdquo; She was laughing, too, but her laughter ceased abruptly as
her eye fell on Egwene and Elayne. &ldquo;You two stop that, or there
<em>will</em> be someone going to the Mistress of Novices. Two
someones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve, you wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Egwene protested. When she
saw the look in Nynaeve&rsquo;s eyes, though, she hastily severed all
contact with <em>saidar</em>. &ldquo;Very well. I believe you. There&rsquo;s no
need to prove it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have to practice,&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;They ask more
and more of us. If we did not practice on our own, we would never
keep up.&rdquo; Her face showed calm composure, but she had let go of
<em>saidar</em> as hastily as Egwene herself had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what happens when you draw too much,&rdquo; Nynaeve
asked, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s no one there to stop you? I wish you were more
afraid. I am. Don&rsquo;t you think I know what it is like for you? It&rsquo;s
always there, and you want to fill yourself with it. Sometimes it
is all I can do to make myself stop; I want all of it. I know it
would burn me to a crisp, and I want it anyway.&rdquo; She shivered. &ldquo;I
just wish you were more afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; Egwene said with a sigh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
terrified. But it doesn&rsquo;t seem to help. What about you,
Elayne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The only thing that terrifies me,&rdquo; Elayne said
airily, &ldquo;is washing dishes. It seems as if I have to wash dishes
every day.&rdquo; Egwene threw her pillow at her. Elayne pulled it off
her head and threw it back, but then her shoulders slumped. &ldquo;Oh,
very well. I am so scared I don&rsquo;t know why my teeth are not
chattering. Elaida told me I&rsquo;d be so frightened that I would want
to run away with the Traveling People, but I did not understand. A
man who drove oxen as hard as they drive us would be shunned. I am
tired all the time. I wake up tired and go to bed exhausted, and
sometimes I&rsquo;m so afraid that I will slip and channel more of the
Power than I can handle that I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Peering into her lap, she let
the words trail off.</p>

<p>Egwene knew what she had not spoken. Their rooms lay
right next to each other, and as in many of the novice rooms, a
small hole had long ago been bored through the wall between, too
small to be seen unless you knew where to look, but useful for talk
after the lamps were extinguished, when the girls could not leave
their rooms. Egwene had heard Elayne crying herself to sleep more
than once, and she had no doubt that Elayne had heard her own
crying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Traveling People are tempting,&rdquo; Nynaeve agreed,
&ldquo;but wherever you go, it will not change what you can do. You
cannot run from <em>saidar</em>.&rdquo; She did not sound as if she liked
what she was saying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you see, Min?&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;Are we all
going to be powerful Aes Sedai, or will we spend the rest of our
lives washing dishes as novices, or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She shrugged
uncomfortably as if she did not want to voice the third alternative
that came to mind. Sent home. Put out of the Tower. Two novices had
been put out since Egwene came, and everyone spoke of them in
whispers, as if they were dead.</p>

<p>Min shifted on her stool. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like reading
friends,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;Friendship gets in the way of the reading.
It makes me try to put the best face on what I see. That&rsquo;s why I
don&rsquo;t do it for you three anymore. Anyway, nothing has changed
about you that I can&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She squinted at them, and suddenly
frowned. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s new,&rdquo; she breathed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked sharply.</p>

<p>Min hesitated before answering. &ldquo;Danger. You are all
in some kind of danger. Or you will be, very soon. I can&rsquo;t make it
out, but it is danger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Nynaeve said to the two girls sitting on
the bed. &ldquo;You must take care. We all must. You must both promise
not to channel again without someone to guide you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it anymore,&rdquo; Egwene
said.</p>

<p>Elayne nodded eagerly. &ldquo;Yes. Let&rsquo;s talk about
something else. Min, if you put on a dress, I&rsquo;ll wager Gawyn would
ask you to go walking with him. You know he&rsquo;s been looking at you,
but I think the breeches and the man&rsquo;s coat put him off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dress the way I like, and I won&rsquo;t change for a
lord, even if he is your brother.&rdquo; Min spoke absently, still
squinting at them and frowning; it was a conversation they had had
before. &ldquo;Sometimes it is useful to pass as a boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one who looks twice believes you are a boy.&rdquo;
Elayne smiled.</p>

<p>Egwene was uncomfortable. Elayne was forcing a
semblance of gaiety, Min was hardly paying attention, and Nynaeve
looked as if she wanted to warn them again.</p>

<p>When the door swung open once more, Egwene bounded to
her feet to close it, grateful for something to do besides watch
the others pretend. Before she reached it, though, a dark-eyed Aes
Sedai with her blond hair done in a multitude of braids stepped
into the room. Egwene blinked in surprise, as much at it being any
Aes Sedai as at Liandrin. She had not heard that Liandrin had
returned to the White Tower, but beyond that, novices were sent for
if an Aes Sedai wanted them; it could mean no good, a sister coming
herself.</p>

<p>The room was crowded with five women in it. Liandrin
paused to adjust her red-fringed shawl, eyeing them. Min did not
move, but Elayne rose, and the three standing curtsied, though
Nynaeve barely flexed her knee. Egwene did not think Nynaeve would
ever grow used to having others in authority over her.</p>

<p>Liandrin&rsquo;s eyes settled on Nynaeve. &ldquo;And why are you
here, in the novices&rsquo; quarters, child?&rdquo; Her tone was ice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am visiting with friends,&rdquo; Nynaeve said in a tight
voice. After a moment she added a belated, &ldquo;Liandrin Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Accepted, they can have no friends among the
novices. This you should have learned by this time, child. But it
is as well that I find you here. You and you&rdquo;&mdash;her finger
stabbed at Elayne and Min&mdash;&ldquo;will go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will return later.&rdquo; Min rose casually, making a
great show of being in no hurry to obey, and strolled by Liandrin
with a grin, of which Liandrin took no notice at all. Elayne gave
Egwene and Nynaeve a worried look before she dropped a curtsy and
left.</p>

<p>After Elayne closed the door behind her, Liandrin
stood studying Egwene and Nynaeve. Egwene began to fidget under the
scrutiny, but Nynaeve held herself straight, with only a little
heightening of her color.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You two are from the same village as the boys who
traveled with Moiraine. Is it not so?&rdquo; Liandrin said suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you have some word of Rand?&rdquo; Egwene asked
eagerly. Liandrin arched an eyebrow at her. &ldquo;Forgive me, Aes Sedai.
I forget myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you word of them?&rdquo; Nynaeve said, just short of
a demand. The Accepted had no rule about not speaking to an Aes
Sedai until spoken to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have concern for them. That is good. They are in
danger, and you might be able to help them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know they&rsquo;re in trouble?&rdquo; There was no
doubt about the demand in Nynaeve&rsquo;s voice this time.</p>

<p>Liandrin&rsquo;s rosebud mouth tightened, but her tone did
not change. &ldquo;Though you are not aware of it, Moiraine has sent
letters to the White Tower concerning you. Moiraine Sedai, she
worries about you, and about your young&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;friends. These boys,
they are in danger. Do you wish to help them, or leave them to
their fate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Egwene said, at the same time that Nynaeve
said; &ldquo;What kind of trouble? Why do <em>you</em> care about helping
them?&rdquo; Nynaeve glanced at the red fringe on Liandrin&rsquo;s shawl. &ldquo;And
I thought you didn&rsquo;t like Moiraine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not presume too much, child,&rdquo; Liandrin said
sharply. &ldquo;To be Accepted is not to be a sister. Accepted and
novices alike listen when a sister speaks, and do as they are
told.&rdquo; She drew a breath and went on; her tone was coldly serene
again, but angry white spots marred her cheeks. &ldquo;Someday, I am
sure, you will serve a cause, and you will learn then that to serve
it you must work even with those whom you dislike. I tell you I
have worked with many with whom I would not share a room if it were
left to me alone. Would you not work alongside the one you hated
worst, if it would save your friends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve nodded reluctantly. &ldquo;But you still haven&rsquo;t
told us what kind of danger they&rsquo;re in. Liandrin Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The danger comes from Shayol Ghul. They are hunted,
as I understand they once before were. If you will come with me,
some dangers, at least, may be eliminated. Do not ask how, for I
cannot tell you, but I tell you flatly it is so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will come, Liandrin Sedai,&rdquo; Egwene said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come where?&rdquo; Nynaeve said. Egwene shot her an
exasperated look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Toman Head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene&rsquo;s mouth fell open, and Nynaeve muttered,
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a war on Toman Head. Does this danger have something to do
with Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s armies?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You believe rumors, child? But even if they were
true, is that enough to stop you? I thought you called these men
friends.&rdquo; A twist to Liandrin&rsquo;s words said she would never do the
same.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will come,&rdquo; Egwene said. Nynaeve opened her mouth
again, but Egwene went right on. &ldquo;We will go, Nynaeve. If Rand
needs our help&mdash;and Mat, and Perrin&mdash;we have to give
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, &ldquo;but what I want to know
is, why us? What can we do that Moiraine&mdash;or you, Liandrin&mdash;cannot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The white grew in Liandrin&rsquo;s cheeks&mdash;Egwene
realized Nynaeve had forgotten the honorific in addressing her&mdash;but what she said was, &ldquo;You two come from their village. In
some way I do not entirely understand, you are connected to them.
Beyond that, I cannot say. And no more of your foolish questions
will I answer. Will you come with me for their sake?&rdquo; She paused
for their assent; a visible tension left her when they nodded.
&ldquo;Good. You will meet me at the northernmost edge of the Ogier grove
one hour before sunset with your horses and whatever you will need
for the journey. Tell no one of this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are not supposed to leave the Tower grounds
without permission,&rdquo; Nynaeve said slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have my permission. Tell no one. No one at all.
The Black Ajah walks the halls of the White Tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene gasped, and heard an echoed gasp from Nynaeve,
but Nynaeve recovered quickly. &ldquo;I thought all Aes Sedai denied the
existence of&mdash;of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Liandrin&rsquo;s mouth tightened into a sneer. &ldquo;Many do,
but Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don approaches, and the time leaves when denials can
be made. The Black Ajah, it is the opposite of everything for which
the Tower stands, but it exists, child. It is everywhere, any woman
could belong to it, and it serves the Dark One. If your friends are
pursued by the Shadow, do you think the Black Ajah will leave you
alive and free to help them? Tell no one&mdash;no one!&mdash;or
you may not live to reach Toman Head. One hour before sunset. Do
not fail me.&rdquo; With that, she was gone, the door closing firmly
behind her.</p>

<p>Egwene collapsed onto her bed with her hands on her
knees. &ldquo;Nynaeve, she&rsquo;s Red Ajah. She can&rsquo;t know about Rand. If she
did&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She cannot know,&rdquo; Nynaeve agreed. &ldquo;I wish I knew why
a Red wanted to help. Or why she&rsquo;s willing to work with Moiraine.
I&rsquo;d have sworn neither of them would give the other water if she
were dying of thirst.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think she&rsquo;s lying?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Nynaeve said dryly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager
my best silver pin against a blueberry that every word she said was
true. But I wonder if we heard what we thought we did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Black Ajah.&rdquo; Egwene shivered. &ldquo;There was no
mistaking what she said about that, the Light help us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No mistaking,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. &ldquo;And she&rsquo;s forestalled
us asking anyone for advice, because after that, who can we trust?
The Light help us indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min and Elayne came bustling in, slamming the door
behind them. &ldquo;Are you really going?&rdquo; Min asked, and Elayne gestured
toward the tiny hole in the wall above Egwene&rsquo;s bed, saying, &ldquo;We
listened from my room. We heard everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene exchanged glances with Nynaeve, wondering how
much they had overheard, and saw the same concern on Nynaeve&rsquo;s
face. <em>If they manage to cipher out about Rand</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have to keep this to yourselves,&rdquo; Nynaeve
cautioned them. &ldquo;I suppose Liandrin has arranged permission from
Sheriam for us to go, but even if she hasn&rsquo;t, even if they start
searching the Tower from top to bottom for us tomorrow, you mustn&rsquo;t
say a word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep it to myself?&rdquo; Min said. &ldquo;No fear on that. I&rsquo;m
going with you. All I do all day is try to explain to one Brown
sister or another something I don&rsquo;t understand myself. I can&rsquo;t even
go for a walk without the Amyrlin herself popping out and asking me
to read whoever we see. When that woman asks you to do something,
there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any way out of it. I must have read half
the White Tower for her, but she always wants another
demonstration. All I needed was an excuse to leave, and this is
it.&rdquo; Her face wore a look of determination that allowed no
argument.</p>

<p>Egwene wondered why Min was so determined to go with
them rather than simply leaving on her own, but before she had time
to do more than wonder, Elayne said, &ldquo;I am going, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elayne,&rdquo; Nynaeve said gently, &ldquo;Egwene and I are the
boys&rsquo; kith from Emond&rsquo;s Field. You are the Daughter-Heir of Andor.
If you disappear from the White Tower, why, it&mdash;it could
start a war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother wouldn&rsquo;t start a war with Tar Valon if they
dried and salted me, which they may be trying to do. If you three
can go off and have an adventure, you needn&rsquo;t think I am going to
stay here and wash dishes, and scrub floors, and have some Accepted
berating me because I didn&rsquo;t make the fire the exact shade of blue
she wanted. Gawyn will die from envy when he finds out.&rdquo; Elayne
grinned and reached over to tug playfully at Egwene&rsquo;s hair.
&ldquo;Besides, if you leave Rand lying about loose, I might have a
chance to pick him up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think either of us is going to have him,&rdquo;
Egwene said sadly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll find whoever he does choose and make her
life miserable. But he couldn&rsquo;t be fool enough to choose someone
else when he could have one of us. Oh, please smile, Egwene. I know
he&rsquo;s yours. I just feel&rdquo;&mdash;she hesitated, searching for the
word&mdash;&ldquo;free. I&rsquo;ve never had an adventure. I&rsquo;ll bet we won&rsquo;t
either of us cry ourselves to sleep on an adventure. And if we do,
we will make sure the gleemen leave that part out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is foolishness,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. &ldquo;We are going to
Toman Head. You&rsquo;ve heard the news, and the rumors. It will be
dangerous. You must stay here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard what Liandrin Sedai said about the&mdash;the Black Ajah, too.&rdquo; Elayne&rsquo;s voice dropped almost to a whisper at
that name. &ldquo;How safe will I be here, if they are here? If Mother
even suspected the Black Ajah really existed, she would pitch me
into the middle of a battle to get me away from them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Elayne&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is only one way for you to stop me coming.
That is to tell the Mistress of Novices. We will make a pretty
picture, all three of us lined up in her study. All four of us. I
don&rsquo;t think Min would escape from something like this. So since you
are not going to tell Sheriam Sedai, I am coming, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve threw up her hands. &ldquo;Perhaps you can say
something to convince her,&rdquo; she told Min.</p>

<p>Min had been leaning against the door, squinting at
Elayne, and now she shook her head. &ldquo;I think she has to come as
much as the rest of you. The rest of us. I can see the danger
around all of you more clearly, now. Not clearly enough to make it
out, but I think it has something to do with you deciding to go.
That&rsquo;s why it is clearer; because it is more certain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no reason for her to come,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, but
Min shook her head again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is linked to&mdash;to those boys as much as
you, or Egwene, or me. She&rsquo;s part of it, Nynaeve, whatever it is.
Part of the Pattern, I suppose an Aes Sedai would say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne seemed taken aback, and interested, too. &ldquo;I
am? What part, Min?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see it clearly.&rdquo; Min looked at the floor.
&ldquo;Sometimes I wish I couldn&rsquo;t read people at all. Most people aren&rsquo;t
satisfied with what I see anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we are all going,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, &ldquo;then we had
best be about making plans.&rdquo; However much she might argue
beforehand, once a course of action had been decided, Nynaeve
always went right to the practicalities: what they had to take with
them, and how cold it would be by the time they reached Toman Head,
and how they could get their horses from the stables without being
stopped.</p>

<p>Listening to her, Egwene could not help wondering
what the danger was that Min saw for them, and what danger
threatened Rand. She knew of only one danger that could threaten
him, and it made her cold to think of it. <em>Hold on, Rand. Hold
on, you wool-headed idiot. I&rsquo;ll help you somehow</em>.</p>
