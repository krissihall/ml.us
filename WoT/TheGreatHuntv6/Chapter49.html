<h4><em>What Was Meant To Be</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">R</span>and
opened his eyes and found himself staring up at
sunlight slanting through the branches of a leatherleaf, its broad,
tough leaves still green despite the time of year. The wind
stirring the leaves carried a hint of snow, come nightfall. He lay
on his back, and he could feel blankets covering him under his
hands. His coat and shirt seemed to be gone, but something was
binding his chest, and his left side hurt. He turned his head, and
Min was sitting there on the ground, watching him. He almost did
not know her, wearing skirts. She smiled uncertainly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Min. It is you. Where did you come from? Where are
we?&rdquo; His memory came in flashes and patches. Old things he could
remember, but the last few days seemed like bits of broken mirror,
spinning through his mind, showing glimpses that were gone before
he could see them clearly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From Falme,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re five days east of
there, now, and you&rsquo;ve been asleep all that time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Falme.&rdquo; More memory. Mat had blown the Horn of
Valere. &ldquo;Egwene! Is she&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Did they free her?&rdquo; He held his
breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what &lsquo;they&rsquo; you mean, but she&rsquo;s free.
We freed her ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We? I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo; <em>She&rsquo;s free. At least
she is</em>&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve, and Elayne, and me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve? Elayne? How? You were <em>all</em> in
Falme?&rdquo; He struggled to sit up, but she pushed him back down easily
and stayed there, hands on his shoulders, eyes intent on his face.
&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone.&rdquo; Min&rsquo;s face colored. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all gone.
Egwene, and Nynaeve, and Mat, and Hurin, and Verin. Hurin didn&rsquo;t
want to leave you, really. They&rsquo;re on their way to Tar Valon.
Egwene and Nynaeve back to their training in the Tower, and Mat for
whatever the Aes Sedai have to do about that dagger. They took the
Horn of Valere with them. I can&rsquo;t believe I actually saw it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t even wait till I
woke up.&rdquo; The red in Min&rsquo;s cheeks deepened, and she sat back,
staring at her lap.</p>

<p>He raised his hands to run them over his face, and
stopped, staring at his palms in shock. There was a heron branded
across his left palm, too, now, to match the one on his right,
every line clean and true. <em>Once the heron to set his path;
Twice the heron to name him true</em>. &ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are gone,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Saying &lsquo;no&rsquo; won&rsquo;t change
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shook his head. Something told him the pain in his
side was important. He could not remember being injured, but it was
important. He started to lift his blankets to look, but she slapped
his hands away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do any good with that. It isn&rsquo;t healed all
the way, yet. Verin tried Healing, but she said it didn&rsquo;t work the
way it should.&rdquo; She hesitated, nibbling her lip. &ldquo;Moiraine says
Nynaeve must have done something, or you wouldn&rsquo;t have lived till
we carried you to Verin, but Nynaeve says she was too frightened to
light a candle. There is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;something wrong with your wound. You
will have to wait for it to heal naturally.&rdquo; She seemed
troubled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moiraine is here?&rdquo; He barked a bitter laugh. &ldquo;When
you said Verin was gone, I thought I was free of Aes Sedai
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am here,&rdquo; Moiraine said. She appeared, all in blue
and as serene as if she stood in the White Tower, strolling up to
stand over him. Min was frowning at the Aes Sedai. Rand had the odd
feeling that she meant to protect him from Moiraine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you weren&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; he told the Aes Sedai. &ldquo;As
far as I am concerned, you can go back to wherever you&rsquo;ve been
hiding and stay there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not been hiding,&rdquo; Moiraine said calmly. &ldquo;I
have been doing what I could, here on Toman Head, and in Falme. It
was little enough, though I learned much. I failed to rescue two of
my sisters before the Seanchan herded them onto the ships with the
Leashed Ones, but I did what I could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you could. You sent Verin to shepherd me, but
I&rsquo;m no sheep, Moiraine. You said I could go where I wanted, and I
mean to go where you are not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not send Verin.&rdquo; Moiraine frowned. &ldquo;She did
that on her own. You are of interest to a great many people, Rand.
Did Fain find you, or you him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sudden change of topic took him by surprise.
&ldquo;Fain? No. A fine hero I make. I tried to rescue Egwene, and Min
did it before me. Fain said he would hurt Emond&rsquo;s Field if I didn&rsquo;t
face him, and I never laid eyes on him. Did he go with the
Seanchan, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine shook her head. &ldquo;I do not know. I wish I
did. But it is as well you did not find him, not until you know
what he is, at least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a Darkfriend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than that. Worse than that. Padan Fain was the
Dark One&rsquo;s creature to the depths of his soul, but I believe that
in Shadar Logoth he fell afoul of Mordeth, who was as vile in
fighting the Shadow as ever the Shadow itself was. Mordeth tried to
consume Fain&rsquo;s soul, to have a human body again, but found a soul
that had been touched directly by the Dark One, and what resulted&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;What resulted was neither Padan Fain nor Mordeth, but something
far more evil, a blend of the two. Fain&mdash;let us call him that&mdash;is more dangerous than you can believe. You might not have
survived such a meeting, and if you had, you might have been worse
than turned to the Shadow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he is alive, if he did not go with the Seanchan,
I have to&mdash;&rdquo; He cut off as she produced his heron-mark sword
from under her cloak. The blade ended abruptly a foot from the
hilt, as if it had been melted. Memory came crashing back. &ldquo;I
killed him,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;This time I killed him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine put the ruined sword aside like the useless
thing it now was, and wiped her hands together. &ldquo;The Dark One is
not slain so easily. The mere fact that he appeared in the sky
above Falme is more than merely troubling. He should not be able to
do that, if he is bound as we believe. And if he is not, why has he
not destroyed us all?&rdquo; Min stirred uneasily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the sky?&rdquo; Rand said in wonder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Both of you,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;Your battle took place
across the sky, in full view of every soul in Falme. Perhaps in
other towns on Toman Head, too, if half what I hear is to be
believed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we saw it all,&rdquo; Min said in a faint voice.
She put a hand over one of Rand&rsquo;s comfortingly.</p>

<p>Moiraine reached under her cloak again and came out
with a rolled parchment, one of the large sheets such as the street
artists in Falme used. The chalks were a little smudged when she
unfurled it, but the picture was still clear enough. A man whose
face was a solid flame fought with a staff against another with a
sword among clouds where lightning danced, and behind them rippled
the Dragon banner. Rand&rsquo;s face was easily recognizable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many have seen that?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Tear it up.
Burn it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai let the parchment roll back up. &ldquo;It
would do no good, Rand. I bought that two days gone, in a village
we passed through. There are hundreds of them, perhaps thousands,
and the tale is being told everywhere of how the Dragon battled the
Dark One in the skies above Falme.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand looked at Min. She nodded reluctantly, and
squeezed his hand. She looked frightened, but she did not flinch
away. <em>I wonder if that&rsquo;s why Egwene left. She was right to
leave</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Pattern weaves itself around you even more
tightly,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;You need me now more than ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need you,&rdquo; he said harshly, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t
want you. I will not have anything to do with this.&rdquo; He remembered
being called Lews Therin; not only by Ba&rsquo;alzamon, but by Artur
Hawkwing. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t. Light, the Dragon is supposed to Break the
World again, to tear everything apart. I will not be the
Dragon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are what you are,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;Already you
stir the world. The Black Ajah has revealed itself for the first
time in two thousand years. Arad Doman and Tarabon were on the
brink of war, and it will be worse when news of Falme reaches them.
Cairhien is in civil war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did nothing in Cairhien,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
blame that on me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doing nothing was always a ploy in the Great Game,&rdquo;
she said with a sigh, &ldquo;and especially as they play it now. You were
the spark, and Cairhien exploded like an Illuminator&rsquo;s firework.
What do you think will happen when word of Falme reaches Arad Doman
and Tarabon? There have always been men willing to proclaim for any
man who called himself the Dragon, but they have never before had
such signs as this. There is more. Here.&rdquo; She tossed a pouch on his
chest.</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment before opening it. Within lay
shards of what seemed to be black-and-white glazed pottery. He had
seen their like before. &ldquo;Another seal on the Dark One&rsquo;s prison,&rdquo; he
mumbled. Min gasped; her grip on his hand sought comfort, now,
rather than offering it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;Three of the seven are broken
now. The one I had, and two I found in the High Lord&rsquo;s dwelling in
Falme. When all seven are broken, perhaps even before, the patch
men put over the hole they drilled into the prison the Creator made
will be torn asunder, and the Dark One will once more be able to
put his hand through that hole and touch the world. And the only
hope of the world is that the Dragon Reborn will be there to face
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min tried to stop Rand from throwing back the
blankets, but he pushed her gently aside. &ldquo;I need to walk.&rdquo; She
helped him up, but with a great many sighs and grumbles about him
making his wound worse. He discovered that his chest was wrapped
round with bandages. Min draped one of the blankets about his
shoulders like a cloak.</p>

<p>For a moment he stood staring down at the heron-mark
sword, what was left of it, lying on the ground. <em>Tam&rsquo;s sword.
My father&rsquo;s sword</em>. Reluctantly, more reluctantly than he had
ever done anything in his life, he let go of the hope that he would
discover Tam really was his father. It felt as if he were tearing
his heart out. But it did not change the way he felt about Tam, and
Emond&rsquo;s Field was the only home he had ever known. <em>Fain is the
important thing. I have one duty left. Stopping him</em>.</p>

<p>The two women had to support him, one on either arm,
down to where the campfires were already burning, not far from a
road of hard-packed dirt. Loial was there, reading a book, <em>To
Sail Beyond the Sunset</em>, and Perrin, staring into one of the
fires. The Shienarans were making preparations for their evening
meal. Lan sat under a tree sharpening his sword; the Warder gave
Rand a careful look, then a nod.</p>

<p>There was something else, too. The Dragon banner
rippled on the wind over the middle of the camp. Somewhere they had
found a proper staff to replace Perrin&rsquo;s sapling.</p>

<p>Rand demanded, &ldquo;What is that doing out where anybody
who passes by can see it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is too late to hide, Rand,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;It
was always too late for you to hide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to put up a sign saying &lsquo;here I am,&rsquo;
either. I&rsquo;ll never find Fain if somebody kills me because of that
banner.&rdquo; He turned to Loial and Perrin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you stayed. I
would have understood if you hadn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why would I not stay?&rdquo; Loial said. &ldquo;You are even
more <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> than I believed, true, but you are still my
friend. I hope you are still my friend.&rdquo; His ears twitched
uncertainly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;For as long as it&rsquo;s safe for you
to be around me, and even after, too.&rdquo; The Ogier&rsquo;s grin nearly
split his face in two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m staying as well,&rdquo; Perrin said. There was a note
of resignation, or acceptance, in his voice. &ldquo;The Wheel weaves us
tight in the Pattern, Rand. Who would have thought it, back in
Emond&rsquo;s Field?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Shienarans were gathering around. To Rand&rsquo;s
surprise, they all fell to their knees. Every one of them watched
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We would pledge ourselves to you,&rdquo; Uno said. The
others kneeling with him nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your oaths are to Ingtar, and Lord Agelmar,&rdquo; Rand
protested. &ldquo;Ingtar died well, Uno. He died so the rest of us could
escape with the Horn.&rdquo; There was no need to tell them or anyone
else the rest. He hoped that Ingtar had found the Light again.
&ldquo;Tell Lord Agelmar that when you return to Fal Dara.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is said,&rdquo; the one-eyed man said carefully, &ldquo;that
when the Dragon is Reborn, he will break all oaths, shatter all
ties. Nothing holds us, now. We would give our oaths to you.&rdquo; He
drew his sword and laid it before him, hilt toward Rand, and the
rest of the Shienarans did the same.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You battled the Dark One,&rdquo; Masema said. Masema, who
hated him. Masema, who looked at him as if seeing a vision of the
Light. &ldquo;I saw you, Lord Dragon. I saw. I am your man, to the
death.&rdquo; His dark eyes shone with fervor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must choose, Rand,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;The world
will be broken whether you break it or not. Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don will
come, and that alone will tear the world apart. Will you still try
to hide from what you are, and leave the world to face the Last
Battle undefended? Choose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were all watching him, all waiting. <em>Death is
lighter than a feather, duty heavier than a mountain</em>. He made
his decision.</p>
