<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
outer courtyard was in ordered turmoil when Rand
finally reached it with his saddlebags and the bundle containing
the harp and flute. The sun climbed toward midday. Men hurried
around the horses, tugging at saddle girths and pack harness,
voices raised. Others darted with last-minute additions to the
pack-saddles, or water for the men working, or dashed off to fetch
something just remembered. But everyone seemed to know exactly what
they were doing and where they were going. The guardwalks and
archers&rsquo; balconies were crowded again, and excitement crackled in
the morning air. Hooves clattered on the paving stones. One of the
packhorses began kicking, and stablemen ran to calm it. The smell
of horses hung thick. Rand&rsquo;s cloak tried to flap in the breeze that
rippled the swooping-hawk banners on the towers, but his bow, slung
across his back, held it down.</p>

<p>From outside the open gates came the sounds of the
Amyrlin&rsquo;s pikemen and archers forming up in the square. They had
marched around from a side gate. One of the trumpeters tested his
horn.</p>

<p>Some of the Warders glanced at Rand as he walked
across the courtyard; a few raised eyebrows when they saw the
heron-mark sword, but none spoke. Half wore the cloaks that were so
queasy-making to look at. Mandarb, Lan&rsquo;s stallion, was there, tall,
and black, and fierce-eyed, but the man himself was not, and none
of the Aes Sedai, none of the women, were in evidence yet either.
Moiraine&rsquo;s white mare, Aldieb, stepped daintily beside the
stallion.</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s bay stallion was with the other group on the
far side of the courtyard, with Ingtar, and a bannerman holding
Ingtar&rsquo;s Gray Owl banner, and twenty other armored men with lances
tipped with two feet of steel, all mounted already. The bars of
their helmets covered their faces, and golden surcoats with the
Black Hawk on the chest hid their plate-and-mail. Only Ingtar&rsquo;s
helmet had a crest, a crescent moon above his brow, points up. Rand
recognized some of the men. Rough-tongued Uno, with a long scar
down his face and only one eye. Ragan and Masema. Others who had
exchanged a word, or played a game of stones. Ragan waved to him,
and Uno nodded, but Masema was not the only one who gave him a cold
stare and turned away. Their packhorses stood placidly, tails
swishing.</p>

<p>The big bay danced as Rand tied his saddlebags and
bundle behind the high-cantled saddle. He put his foot in the
stirrup and murmured, &ldquo;Easy, Red,&rdquo; as he swung into the saddle, but
he let the stallion frisk away some of his stable-bound energy.</p>

<p>To Rand&rsquo;s surprise, Loial appeared from the direction
of the stables, riding to join them. The Ogier&rsquo;s hairy-fetlocked
mount was as big and heavy as a prime Dhurran stallion. Beside it,
all the other animals looked the size of Bela, but with Loial in
the saddle, the horse seemed almost a pony.</p>

<p>Loial carried no weapon that Rand could see; he had
never heard of any Ogier using a weapon. Their <em>stedding</em>
were protection enough. And Loial had his own priorities, his own
ideas of what was needed for a journey. The pockets of his long
coat had a telltale bulge, and his saddlebags showed the square
imprints of books.</p>

<p>The Ogier stopped his horse a little way off and
looked at Rand, his tufted ears twitching uncertainly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were coming,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
think you would have had enough of traveling with us. This time
there&rsquo;s no telling how long it will be, or where we will end
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial&rsquo;s ears lifted a little. &ldquo;There was no telling
when I first met you, either. Besides, what held then, holds now. I
can&rsquo;t let the chance pass to see history actually weave itself
around <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>. And to help find the Horn&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat and Perrin rode up behind Loial and paused. Mat
looked a little tired around the eyes, but his face wore a bloom of
health.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat,&rdquo; Rand said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for what I said. Perrin,
I didn&rsquo;t mean it. I was being stupid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat only glanced at him, then shook his head and
mouthed something to Perrin that Rand could not hear. Mat had only
his bow and quiver, but Perrin also wore his axe at his belt, with
its big half-moon blade balanced by a thick spike.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat? Perrin? Really, I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; They rode on
toward Ingtar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is not a coat for traveling, Rand,&rdquo; Loial
said.</p>

<p>Rand glanced down at the golden thorns climbing his
crimson sleeve and grimaced. <em>Small wonder Mat and Perrin still
think I&rsquo;m putting on airs</em>. On returning to his room he had
found everything already packed and sent on. All of the plain coats
he had been given were on the packhorses, so the servants said;
every coat left in the wardrobe was at least as ornate as the one
he wore. His saddlebags held nothing in the way of clothes but a
few shirts, some wool stockings, and a spare pair of breeches. At
least he had removed the golden cord from his sleeve, though he had
the red eagle pin in his pocket. Lan had meant it for a gift, after
all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll change when we stop tonight,&rdquo; he muttered. He
took a deep breath. &ldquo;Loial, I said things to you I should not have,
and I hope you&rsquo;ll forgive me. You have every right to hold them
against me, but I hope you won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial grinned, and his ears stood up. He moved his
horse closer. &ldquo;I say things I should not all the time. The Elders
always said I spoke an hour before I thought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly Lan was at Rand&rsquo;s stirrup, in his gray-green
scaled armor that would make him all but disappear in forest or
darkness. &ldquo;I need to talk to you, sheepherder.&rdquo; He looked at Loial.
&ldquo;Alone, if you please, Builder.&rdquo; Loial nodded and moved his big
horse away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I should listen to you,&rdquo; Rand told
the Warder. &ldquo;These fancy clothes, and all those things you told me,
they didn&rsquo;t help much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you can&rsquo;t win a big victory, sheepherder, learn
to settle for the small ones. If you made them think of you as
something more than a farmboy who&rsquo;ll be easy to handle, then you
won a small victory. Now be quiet and listen. I&rsquo;ve only time for
one last lesson, the hardest. Sheathing the Sword.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve spent an hour every morning making me do
nothing but draw this bloody sword and put it back in the scabbard.
Standing, sitting, lying down. I think I can manage to get it back
in the sheath without cutting myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said listen, sheepherder,&rdquo; the Warder growled.
&ldquo;There will come a time when you must achieve a goal at all costs.
It may come in attack or in defense. And the only way will be to
allow the sword to be sheathed in your own body.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s crazy,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;Why would I
ever&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Warder cut him off. &ldquo;You will know when it comes,
sheepherder, when the price is worth the gain, and there is no
other choice left to you. That is called Sheathing the Sword.
Remember it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin appeared, striding across the crowded
courtyard with Leane and her staff, and Lord Agelmar at her
shoulder. Even in a green velvet coat, the Lord of Fal Dara did not
look out of place among so many armored men. There was still no
sign of the other Aes Sedai. As they went by, Rand caught part of
their conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Mother,&rdquo; Agelmar was protesting, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve had no
time to rest from the journey here. Stay at least a few days more.
I promise you a feast tonight such as you could hardly get in Tar
Valon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin shook her head without breaking stride.
&ldquo;I cannot, Agelmar. You know I would if I could. I had never
planned to remain long, and matters urgently require my presence in
the White Tower. I should be there now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, it shames me that you come one day and leave
the next. I swear to you, there will be no repetition of last
night. I have tripled the guard on the city gates as well as the
keep. I have tumblers in from the town, and a bard coming from Mos
Shirare. Why, King Easar will be on his way from Fal Moran. I sent
word as soon as&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their voices faded as they crossed the courtyard,
swallowed up by the din of preparation. The Amyrlin never as much
as glanced in Rand&rsquo;s direction.</p>

<p>When Rand looked down, the Warder was gone, and
nowhere to be seen. Loial brought his horse back to Rand&rsquo;s side.
&ldquo;That is a hard man to catch and hold, isn&rsquo;t he, Rand? He&rsquo;s not
here, then he&rsquo;s here, then he&rsquo;s gone, and you don&rsquo;t see him coming
or going.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Sheathing the Sword</em>. Rand shivered.
<em>Warders must all be crazy</em>.</p>

<p>The Warder the Amyrlin was speaking to suddenly
sprang into his saddle. He was at a dead gallop before he reached
the wide-standing gates. She stood watching him go, and her stance
seemed to urge him to go faster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is he headed in such a hurry?&rdquo; Rand wondered
aloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard,&rdquo; Loial said, &ldquo;that she was sending someone
out today, all the way to Arad Doman. There is word of some sort of
trouble on Almoth Plain, and the Amyrlin Seat wants to know exactly
what. What I don&rsquo;t understand is, why now? From what I hear, the
rumors of this trouble came from Tar Valon with the Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand felt cold. Egwene&rsquo;s father had a big map back at
home, a map Rand had pored over more than once, dreaming before he
found out what the dreams were like when they came true. It was
old, that map, showing some lands and nations the merchants from
outside said no longer existed, but Almoth Plain was marked,
butting against Toman Head. <em>We will meet again on Toman
Head</em>. It was all the way across the world he knew, on the
Aryth Ocean. &ldquo;It has nothing to do with us,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Nothing
to do with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial appeared not to have heard. Rubbing the side of
his nose with a finger like a sausage, the Ogier was still peering
at the gate where the Warder had vanished. &ldquo;If she wanted to know,
why not send someone before she left Tar Valon? But you humans are
always sudden and excitable, always jumping around and shouting.&rdquo;
His ears stiffened with embarrassment. &ldquo;I <em>am</em> sorry, Rand.
You see what I mean about speaking before I think. I&rsquo;m rash and
excitable sometimes myself, as you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand laughed. It was a weak laugh, but it felt good
to have something to laugh at. &ldquo;Maybe if we lived as long as you
Ogier, we&rsquo;d be more settled.&rdquo; Loial was ninety years old; by Ogier
standards, not old enough by ten years to be outside the
<em>stedding</em> alone. That he had gone anyway was proof, he
maintained, of his rashness. If Loial was an excitable Ogier, Rand
thought most of them must be made of stone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; Loial mused, &ldquo;but you humans do so much
with your lives. We do nothing but huddle in our <em>stedding</em>.
Planting the groves, and even the building, were all done before
the Long Exile ended.&rdquo; It was the groves Loial held dear, not the
cities men remembered the Ogier for building. It was the groves,
planted to remind Ogier Builders of the <em>stedding</em>, that
Loial had left his home to see. &ldquo;Since we found our way back to the
<em>stedding</em>, we&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; His words trailed off as the Amyrlin
approached.</p>

<p>Ingtar and the other men shifted in their saddles,
preparing to dismount and kneel, but she motioned them to stay as
they were. Leane stood at her shoulder, and Agelmar a pace back.
From his glum face, he appeared to have given up trying to convince
her to remain longer.</p>

<p>The Amyrlin looked at them one by one before she
spoke. Her gaze stayed on Rand no longer than on any other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peace favor your sword, Lord Ingtar,&rdquo; she said
finally. &ldquo;Glory to the Builders, Loial Kiseran.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You honor us, Mother. May peace favor Tar Valon.&rdquo;
Ingtar bowed in his saddle, and the other Shienarans did, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All honor to Tar Valon,&rdquo; Loial said, bowing.</p>

<p>Only Rand, and his two friends on the other side of
the party, stayed upright. He wondered what she had said to them.
Leane&rsquo;s frown took in all three of them, and Agelmar&rsquo;s eyes
widened, but the Amyrlin took no notice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ride to find the Horn of Valere,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
the hope of the world rides with you. The Horn cannot be left in
the wrong hands, especially in Darkfriend hands. Those who come to
answer its call, will come whoever blows it, and they are bound to
the Horn, not to the Light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a stir among the listening men. Everyone
believed that those heroes called back from the grave would fight
for the Light. If they could fight for the Shadow, instead&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin went on, but Rand was no longer
listening. The watcher was back. The hair stirred on the back of
his neck. He peered up at the packed archers&rsquo; balconies overlooking
the courtyard, at the rows of people jammed along the guardwalks
atop the walls. Somewhere among them was the set of eyes that had
followed him unseen. The gaze clung to him like dirty oil. <em>It
can&rsquo;t be a Fade, not here. Then who? Or what?</em> He twisted in
his saddle, pulling Red around, searching. The bay began to dance
again.</p>

<p>Suddenly something flashed across in front of Rand&rsquo;s
face. A man passing behind the Amyrlin cried out and fell, a
black-fletched arrow jutting from his side. The Amyrlin stood
calmly looking at a rent in her sleeve; blood slowly stained the
gray silk.</p>

<p>A woman screamed, and abruptly the courtyard rang
with cries and shouts. The people on the walls milled furiously,
and every man in the courtyard had his sword out. Even Rand, he was
surprised to realize.</p>

<p>Agelmar shook his blade at the sky. &ldquo;Find him!&rdquo; he
roared. &ldquo;Bring him to me!&rdquo; His face went from red to white when he
saw the blood on the Amyrlin&rsquo;s sleeve. He fell to his knees, head
bowed. &ldquo;Forgive, Mother. I have failed your safety. I am
ashamed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Agelmar,&rdquo; the Amyrlin said. &ldquo;Leane, stop
fussing over me and see to that man. I&rsquo;ve cut myself worse than
this more than once cleaning fish, and he needs help now. Agelmar,
stand up. Stand up, Lord of Fal Dara. You have not failed me, and
you have no reason for shame. Last year in the White Tower, with my
own guards at every gate and Warders all around me, a man with a
knife came within five steps of me. A Whitecloak, no doubt, though
I&rsquo;ve no proof. Please stand up, or I will be shamed.&rdquo; As Agelmar
slowly rose, she fingered her sliced sleeve. &ldquo;A poor shot for a
Whitecloak bowman, or even a Darkfriend.&rdquo; Her eyes flickered up to
touch Rand&rsquo;s. &ldquo;If it was at me he aimed.&rdquo; Her gaze was gone before
he could read anything on her face, but he suddenly wanted to
dismount and hide.</p>

<p><em>It wasn&rsquo;t aimed at her, and she knows
it.</em></p>

<p>Leane straightened from where she had been kneeling.
Someone had laid a cloak over the face of the man who had taken the
arrow. &ldquo;He is dead, Mother.&rdquo; She sounded tired. &ldquo;He was dead when
he struck the ground. Even if I had been at his side&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did what you could, Daughter. Death cannot be
Healed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Agelmar moved closer. &ldquo;Mother, if there are
Whitecloak killers about, or Darkfriends, you must allow me to send
men with you. As far as the river, at least. I could not live if
harm came to you in Shienar. Please, return to the women&rsquo;s
apartments. I will see them guarded with my life until you are
ready to travel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be at ease,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;This scratch will not
delay me a moment. Yes, yes, I will gladly accept your men as far
as the river, if you insist. But I will not let this delay Lord
Ingtar a moment, either. Every heartbeat counts until the Horn is
found again. Your leave, Lord Agelmar, to order your oathmen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He bowed his head in assent. At that moment he would
have given her Fal Dara had she asked.</p>

<p>The Amyrlin turned back to Ingtar and the men
gathered behind him. She did not look at Rand again. He was
surprised to see her smile suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wager Illian does not give its Great Hunt of the
Horn so rousing a send-off,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But yours is the true Great
Hunt. You are few, so you may travel quickly, yet enough to do what
you must. I charge you, Lord Ingtar of House Shinowa, I charge all
of you, find the Horn of Valere, and let nothing bar your way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ingtar whipped his sword from his back and kissed the
blade. &ldquo;By my life and soul, by my House and honor, I swear it,
Mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then ride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ingtar swung his horse toward the gate.</p>

<p>Rand dug his heels into Red&rsquo;s flanks and galloped
after the column already disappearing through the gates.</p>

<p>Unaware of what had occurred within, the Amyrlin&rsquo;s
pikemen and archers stood walling a path from the gates to the city
proper, the Flame of Tar Valon on their chests. Her drummers and
trumpeters waited near the gates, ready to fall in when she left.
Behind the rows of armored men, people packed the square in front
of the keep. Some cheered Ingtar&rsquo;s banner, and others no doubt
thought this was the start of the Amyrlin Seat&rsquo;s departure. A
swelling roar followed Rand across the square.</p>

<p>He caught up with Ingtar where low-eaved houses and
shops stood to either side, and more people thickly lined the
stone-paved street. Some of them cheered, too. Mat and Perrin had
been riding at the head of the column with Ingtar and Loial, but
the two of them fell back when Rand joined them. <em>How am I ever
going to apologize if they won&rsquo;t stay near me long enough for me to
say anything? Burn me, he doesn&rsquo;t</em> look <em>like he&rsquo;s
dying</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Changu and Nidao are gone,&rdquo; Ingtar said abruptly. He
sounded cold and angry, but shaken, too. &ldquo;We counted every head in
the keep, alive or dead, last night and again this morning. They
are the only ones not accounted for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Changu was on guard in the dungeon yesterday,&rdquo; Rand
said slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Nidao. They had the second watch. They always
stayed together, even if they had to trade or do extra duty for it.
They were not on guard when it happened, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;They fought at
Tarwin&rsquo;s Gap, a month gone, and saved Lord Agelmar when his horse
went down with Trollocs all around him. Now this. Darkfriends.&rdquo; He
drew a deep breath. &ldquo;Everything is breaking apart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A man on horseback forced his way through the throng
lining the street and joined in behind Ingtar. He was a townsman,
by his clothes, lean, with a lined face and graying hair cut long.
A bundle and waterbottles were lashed behind his saddle, and a
short-bladed sword and a notched sword-breaker hung at his belt,
along with a cudgel.</p>

<p>Ingtar noticed Rand&rsquo;s glances. &ldquo;This is Hurin, our
sniffer. There was no need to let the Aes Sedai know about him. Not
that what he does is wrong, you understand. The King keeps a
sniffer in Fal Moran, and there&rsquo;s another in Ankor Dail. It&rsquo;s just
that Aes Sedai seldom like what they do not understand, and with
him being a man&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s nothing to do with the Power, of course.
Aaaah! You tell him, Hurin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Lord Ingtar,&rdquo; the man said. He bowed low to
Rand from his saddle. &ldquo;Honor to serve, my Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call me Rand.&rdquo; Rand stuck out his hand, and after a
moment Hurin grinned and took it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you wish, my Lord Rand. Lord Ingtar and Lord
Kajin don&rsquo;t mind a man&rsquo;s ways&mdash;and Lord Agelmar, of course&mdash;but they say in the town you&rsquo;re an outland prince from the
south, and some outland lords are strict for every man in his
place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a lord.&rdquo; <em>At least I&rsquo;ll get away from
that, now</em>. &ldquo;Just Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hurin blinked. &ldquo;As you wish, my Lor&mdash;ah&mdash;Rand. I&rsquo;m a sniffer, you see. Been one four years this
Sunday. I never heard of such a thing before then, but I hear
there&rsquo;s a few others like me. It started slow, catching bad smells
where nobody else smelled anything, and it grew. Took a whole year
before I realized what it was. I could smell violence, the killing
and the hurting. Smell where it happened. Smell the trail of those
who did it. Every trail&rsquo;s different, so there&rsquo;s no chance of mixing
them up. Lord Ingtar heard of it, and took me in his service, to
serve the King&rsquo;s justice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can smell violence?&rdquo; Rand said. He could not
help looking at the man&rsquo;s nose. It was an ordinary nose, not large,
not small. &ldquo;You mean you can really follow somebody who, say,
killed another man? By smell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can that, my Lor&mdash;ah&mdash;Rand. It fades with
time, but the worse the violence, the longer it lasts. Aiie, I can
smell a battlefield ten years old, though the trails of the men who
were there are gone. Up near the Blight, the trails of the Trollocs
almost never fade. Not much to a Trolloc but killing and hurting. A
fight in a tavern, though, with maybe a broken arm&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that
smell&rsquo;s gone in hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can see where you wouldn&rsquo;t want Aes Sedai to find
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Lord Ingtar was right about the Aes Sedai, the
Light illumine them&mdash;ah&mdash;Rand. There was one in Cairhien
once&mdash;Brown Ajah, but I swear I thought she was Red before
she let me go&mdash;she kept me a month trying to find out how I
do it. She didn&rsquo;t like not knowing. She kept muttering, &lsquo;Is it old
come again, or new?&rsquo; and staring at me until you would have thought
I was using the One Power. Almost had me doubting myself. But I
haven&rsquo;t gone mad, and I don&rsquo;t <em>do</em> anything. I just smell
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand could not help remembering Moiraine. <em>Old
barriers weaken. There is something of dissolution and change about
our time. Old things walk again, and new things are born. We may
live to see the end of an Age</em>. He shivered. &ldquo;So we&rsquo;ll track
those who took the Horn with your nose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ingtar nodded. Hurin grinned proudly, and said, &ldquo;We
will that&mdash;ah&mdash;Rand. I followed a murderer to Cairhien,
once, and another all the way to Maradon, to bring them back for
the King&rsquo;s justice.&rdquo; His grin faded, and he looked troubled. &ldquo;This
is the worst ever, though. Murder smells bad, and the trail of a
murderer stinks with it, but this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; His nose wrinkled. &ldquo;There
were men in it last night. Darkfriends, must be, but you can&rsquo;t tell
a Darkfriend by smell. What I&rsquo;ll follow is the Trollocs, and the
Halfmen. And something even worse.&rdquo; He trailed off, frowning and
muttering to himself, but Rand could hear it. &ldquo;Something even
worse, the Light help me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They reached the city gates, and just beyond the
walls Hurin lifted his face to the breeze. His nostrils flared,
then he gave a snort of disgust. &ldquo;That way, my Lord Ingtar.&rdquo; He
pointed south.</p>

<p>Ingtar looked surprised. &ldquo;Not toward the Blight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Lord Ingtar. Faugh!&rdquo; Hurin wiped his mouth on
his sleeve. &ldquo;I can almost taste them. South, they went.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was right, then, the Amyrlin Seat,&rdquo; Ingtar said
slowly. &ldquo;A great and wise woman, who deserves better than me to
serve her. Take the trail, Hurin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand turned and peered back through the gates, up the
street to the keep. He hoped Egwene was all right. <em>Nynaeve will
look after her. Maybe it&rsquo;s better this way, like a clean cut, too
quick to hurt till after it&rsquo;s done</em>.</p>

<p>He rode after Ingtar and the Gray Owl banner, south.
The wind was making up, and cold against his back despite the sun.
He thought he heard laughter in it, faint and mocking.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The waxing moon lit the humid, night-dark streets of
Illian, which still rang with celebration left over from daylight.
In only a few more days, the Great Hunt of the Horn would be sent
forth with pomp and ceremony that tradition claimed dated to the
Age of Legends. The festivities for the Hunters had blended into
the Feast of Teven, with its famed contests and prizes for gleemen.
The greatest prize of all, as always, would go for the best telling
of <em>The Great Hunt of the Horn</em>.</p>

<p>Tonight the gleemen entertained in the palaces and
mansions of the city, where the great and mighty disported
themselves, and the Hunters come from every nation to ride out and
find, if not the Horn of Valere itself, at least immortality in
song and story. They would have music and dancing, and fans and
ices to dispel the year&rsquo;s first real heat, but carnival filled the
streets, too, in the moon-bright muggy night. Every day was a
carnival, until the Hunt departed, and every night.</p>

<p>People ran past Bayle Domon in masks and costumes
bizarre and fanciful, many showing too much flesh. Shouting and
singing they ran, a half dozen together, then scattered pairs
giggling and clutching each other, then twenty in a raucous knot.
Fireworks crackled in the sky, gold and silver bursts against the
black. There were almost as many Illuminators in the city as there
were gleemen.</p>

<p>Domon spared little thought for fireworks, or for the
Hunt. He was on his way to meet men he thought might be trying to
kill him.</p>

<p>He crossed the Bridge of Flowers, over one of the
city&rsquo;s many canals, into the Perfumed Quarter, the port district of
Illian. The canal smelled of too many chamber pots, with never a
sign that there had ever been flowers near the bridge. The quarter
smelled of hemp and pitch from the shipyards and docks, and sour
harbor mud, all of it made fiercer by heated air that seemed nearly
damp enough to drink. Domon breathed heavily; every time he
returned from the northcountry he found himself surprised, for all
he had been born there, at the early summer heat in Illian.</p>

<p>In one hand he carried a stout cudgel, and the other
hand rested on the hilt of the short sword he had often used in
defending the decks of his river trader from brigands. No few
footpads stalked these nights of revelry, where the pickings were
rich and most were deep in wine.</p>

<p>Yet he was a broad, muscular man, and none of those
out for a catch of gold thought him rich enough, in his plain-cut
coat, to risk his size and his cudgel. The few who caught a clear
glimpse of him, when he passed through light spilling from a
window, edged back till he was well past. Dark hair that hung to
his shoulders and a long beard that left his upper lip bare framed
a round face, but that face had never been soft, and now it was set
as grimly as if he meant to batter his way through a wall. He had
men to meet, and he was not happy about it.</p>

<p>More revelers ran past singing off-key, wine mangling
their words. &ldquo;<em>The Horn of Valere,&rdquo; my aged grandmother!</em>
Domon thought glumly. <em>It be my ship I do want to hang on to.
And my life, Fortune prick me</em>.</p>

<p>He pushed into an inn, under a sign of a big,
white-striped badger dancing on its hind legs with a man carrying a
silver shovel. Easing the Badger, it was called, though not even
Nieda Sidoro, the innkeeper, knew what the name meant; there had
always been an inn of the name in Illian.</p>

<p>The common room, with sawdust on the floor and a
musician softly strumming a twelve-stringed bittern in one of the
Sea Folk&rsquo;s sad songs, was well lighted and quiet. Nieda allowed no
commotion in her place, and her nephew, Bili, was big enough to
carry a man out with either hand. Sailors, dockworkers, and
warehousemen came to the Badger for a drink and maybe a little
talk, for a game of stones or darts. The room was half full now;
even men who liked quiet had been lured out by carnival. The talk
was soft, but Domon caught mentions of the Hunt, and of the false
Dragon the Murandians had taken, and of the one the Tarens were
chasing through Haddon Mirk. There seemed to be some question
whether it would be preferable to see the false Dragon die, or the
Tairens.</p>

<p>Domon grimaced. <em>False Dragons! Fortune prick me,
there be no place safe these days</em>. But he had no real care for
false Dragons, any more than for the Hunt.</p>

<p>The stout proprietress, with her hair rolled at the
back of her head, was wiping a mug, keeping a sharp eye on her
establishment. She did not stop what she was doing, or even look at
him, really, but, her left eyelid drooped, and her eyes slanted
toward three men at a table in the corner. They were quiet even for
the Badger, almost somber, and their bell-shaped velvet caps and
dark coats, embroidered across the chest in bars of silver and
scarlet and gold, stood out among the plain dress of the other
patrons.</p>

<p>Domon sighed and took a table in a corner by himself.
<em>Cairhienin, this time</em>. He took a mug of brown ale from a
serving girl and drew a long swallow. When he lowered the mug, the
three men in striped coats were standing beside his table. He made
an unobtrusive gesture, to let Nieda know that he did not need
Bili.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Domon?&rdquo; They were all three nondescript, but
there was an air about the speaker that made Domon take him for
their leader. They did not appear to be armed; despite their fine
clothes, they looked as if they did not need to be. There were hard
eyes in those so very ordinary faces. &ldquo;Captain Bayle Domon, of the
<em>Spray</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Domon gave a short nod, and the three sat down
without waiting for an invitation. The same man did the talking;
the other two just watched, hardly blinking. <em>Guards</em>, Domon
thought, <em>for all their fine clothes. Who do he be to have a
pair of guards to look over him?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Domon, we have a personage who must be
brought from Mayene to Illian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Spray</em> be a river craft,&rdquo; Domon cut him off.
&ldquo;Her draft be shallow, and she has no the keel for deep water.&rdquo; It
was not exactly true, but close enough for landsmen. <em>At least
it be a change from Tear. They be getting smarter</em>.</p>

<p>The man seemed unperturbed at the interruption. &ldquo;We
had heard you were giving up the river trade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe I do, and maybe no. I have no decided.&rdquo; He
had, though. He would not go back upriver, back to the Borderlands,
for all the silk shipped in Tairen bottoms. Saldaean furs and ice
peppers were not worth it, and it had nothing to do with the false
Dragon he had heard of there. But he wondered again how anyone
knew. He had not spoken of it to anyone, yet the others had known,
too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can coast to Mayene easily enough. Surely,
Captain, you would be willing to sail along the shoreline for a
thousand gold marks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite himself, Domon goggled. It was four times the
last offer, and that had been enough to make a man&rsquo;s jaw drop. &ldquo;Who
do you want me to fetch for that? The First of Mayene herself? Has
Tear finally forced her all the way out, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need no names, Captain.&rdquo; The man set a large
leather pouch on the table, and a sealed parchment. The pouch
clinked heavily as he pushed them across the table. The big red wax
circle holding the folded parchment shut bore the many-rayed Rising
Sun of Cairhien. &ldquo;Two hundred on account. For a thousand marks, I
think you need no names. Give that, seal unbroken, to the Port
Captain of Mayene, and he will give you three hundred more, and
your passenger. I will hand over the remainder when your passenger
is delivered here. So long as you have made no effort to discover
that personage&rsquo;s identity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Domon drew a deep breath. <em>Fortune, it be worth
the voyage if there be never another penny beyond what be in that
sack</em>. And a thousand was more money than he would clear in
three years. He suspected that if he probed a little more, there
would be other hints, just hints, that the voyage involved hidden
dealings between Illian&rsquo;s Council of Nine and the First of Mayene.
The First&rsquo;s city-state was a province of Tear in all but name, and
she would no doubt like Illian&rsquo;s aid. And there were many in Illian
who said it was time for another war, that Tear was taking more
than a fair share of the trade on the Sea of Storms. A likely net
to snare him, if he had not seen three like it in the past
month.</p>

<p>He reached to take the pouch, and the man who had
done all the talking caught his wrist. Domon glared at him, but he
looked back undisturbed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must sail as soon as possible, Captain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At first light,&rdquo; Domon growled, and the man nodded
and released his hold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At first light, then, Captain Domon. Remember,
discretion keeps a man alive to spend his money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Domon watched the three of them leave, then stared
sourly at the pouch and the parchment on the table in front of him.
Someone wanted him to go east. Tear or Mayene, it did not matter so
long as he went east. He thought he knew who wanted it. <em>And
then again, I have no a clue to them</em>. Who could know who was a
Darkfriend? But he knew that Darkfriends had been after him since
before he left Marabon to come back downriver. Darkfriends and
Trollocs. Of that, he was sure. The real question, the one he had
not even a glimmer of an answer for, was why?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trouble, Bayle?&rdquo; Nieda asked. &ldquo;You do look as if you
had seen a Trolloc.&rdquo; She giggled, an improbable sound from a woman
her size. Like most people who had never been to the Borderlands,
Nieda did not believe in Trollocs. He had tried telling her the
truth of it; she enjoyed his stories, and thought they were all
lies. She did not believe in snow, either.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No trouble, Nieda.&rdquo; He untied the pouch, dug a coin
out without looking, and tossed it to her. &ldquo;Drinks for everyone
till that do run out, then I&rsquo;ll give you another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nieda looked at the coin in surprise. &ldquo;A Tar Valon
mark! Do you be trading with the witches now, Bayle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said hoarsely. &ldquo;That I do not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She bit the coin, then quickly snugged it away behind
her broad belt. &ldquo;Well, it be gold for that. And I suspect the
witches be no so bad as some make them out, anyway. I&rsquo;d no say so
much to many men. I know a money changer who do handle such. You&rsquo;ll
no have to give me another, with as few as be here tonight. More
ale for you, Bayle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He nodded numbly, though his mug was still almost
full, and she trundled off. She was a friend, and would not speak
of what she had seen. He sat staring at the leather pouch. Another
mug was brought before he could make himself open it enough to look
at the coins inside. He stirred them with a callused finger. Gold
marks glittered up at him in the lamplight, every one of them
bearing the damning Flame of Tar Valon. Hurriedly he tied the bag.
Dangerous coins. One or two might pass, but so many would say to
most people exactly what Nieda thought. There were Children of the
Light in the city, and although there was no law in Illian against
dealing with Aes Sedai, he would never make it to a magistrate if
the Whitecloaks heard of this. These men had made sure he would not
simply take the gold and stay in Illian.</p>

<p>While he was sitting there worrying, Yarin Maeldan,
his brooding, stork-like second on <em>Spray</em>, came into the
Badger with his brows pulled down to his long nose and stood over
the captain&rsquo;s table. &ldquo;Carn&rsquo;s dead, Captain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Domon stared at him, frowning. Three others of his
men had already been killed, one each time he refused a commission
that would take him east. The magistrates had done nothing; the
streets were dangerous at night, they said, and sailors a rough and
quarrelsome lot. Magistrates seldom troubled themselves with what
happened in the Perfumed Quarter, as long as no respectable
citizens were injured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this time I did accept them,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t all, Captain,&rdquo; Yarin said. &ldquo;They worked Carn
with knives, like they wanted him to tell them something. And some
more men tried to sneak aboard <em>Spray</em> not an hour gone. The
dock watch ran them off. Third time in ten days, and I never knew
wharf rats to be so persistent. They like to let an alarm die down
before they try again. And somebody tossed my room at the Silver
Dolphin last night. Took some silver, so I&rsquo;d think it was thieves,
but they left that belt buckle of mine, the one set with garnets
and moonstones, lying right out in plain sight. What&rsquo;s going on,
Captain? The men are afraid, and I&rsquo;m a little nervous myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Domon reared to his feet. &ldquo;Roust the crew, Yarin.
Find them and tell them <em>Spray</em> sails as soon as there do be
men enough aboard to handle her.&rdquo; Stuffing the parchment into his
coat pocket, he snatched up the bag of gold and pushed his second
out the door ahead of him. &ldquo;Roust them, Yarin, for I&rsquo;ll leave any
man who no makes it, standing on the quay as he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Domon gave Yarin a shove to start him running, then
stalked off toward the docks. Even footpads who heard the clinking
of the pouch he carried steered clear of him, for he walked now
like a man going to do murder.</p>

<p>There were already crewmen scrambling aboard
<em>Spray</em> when he arrived, and more running barefoot down the
stone quay. They did not know what he feared was pursuing him, or
even that anything did pursue him, but they knew he made good
profits, and after the Illianer way, he gave shares to the
crew.</p>

<p><em>Spray</em> was eighty feet long, with two masts,
and broad in the beam, with room for deck cargo as well as in the
holds. Despite what Domon had told the Cairhienin&mdash;if they
had been Cairhienin&mdash;he thought she could stand the open
water. The Sea of Storms was quieter in the summer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll have to,&rdquo; he muttered, and strode below to
his cabin.</p>

<p>He tossed the sack of gold on his bed, built neatly
against the hull like everything else in the stern cabin, and dug
out the parchment. Lighting a lantern, hanging in its swivel from
the overhead, he studied the sealed document, turning it as if he
could read what was inside without opening it. A rap on the door
made him frown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yarin stuck his head in. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all aboard but
three I couldn&rsquo;t find, Captain. But I&rsquo;ve spread the word through
every tavern, hell, and crib in the quarter. They&rsquo;ll be aboard
before it&rsquo;s light enough to start upriver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Spray</em> do sail now. To sea.&rdquo; Domon cut off
Yarin&rsquo;s protests about light and tides, and <em>Spray</em> not
being built for the open sea. &ldquo;Now! <em>Spray</em> can clear the
bars at dead low tide. You&rsquo;ve no forgotten how to sail by the
stars, have you? Take her out, Yarin. Take her out now, and come
back to me when we be beyond the breakwater.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His second hesitated&mdash;Domon never let a tricky
bit of sailing pass without him on deck giving orders, and taking
<em>Spray</em> out in the night would be all of that, shallow draft
or no&mdash;then nodded and vanished. In moments the sounds of
Yarin shouting orders and bare feet thumping on the decks overhead
penetrated Domon&rsquo;s cabin. He ignored them, even when the ship
lurched, catching the tide.</p>

<p>Finally he lifted the mantle of the lantern and stuck
a knife into the flame. Smoke curled up as oil burned off the
blade, but before the metal could turn red, he pushed charts out of
the way and pressed the parchment flat on his desk, working the hot
steel slowly under the sealing wax. The top fold lifted.</p>

<p>It was a simple document, without preamble or
salutation, and it made sweat break out on his forehead.</p>

<p class="note">The bearer of this is a Darkfriend wanted in Cairhien for
murders and other foul crimes, least among them, theft from Our
Person. We call upon you to seize this man and all things found in
his keeping, to the smallest. Our representative will come to carry
away what he has stolen from Us. Let all he possesses, save what We
claim, go to you at reward for taking him. Let the vile miscreant
himself be hanged immediately, that his Shadow-spawned villainy no
longer taint the Light.</p>

<p class="note_sig">Sealed by Our Hand<br>
Galldrian su Riatin Rie<br>
King of Cairhien<br>
Defender of the Dragonwall</p>

<p>In thin red wax below the signature were impressed
the Rising Sun seal of Cairhien and the Five Stars of House
Riatin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Defender of the Dragonwall, my aged grandmother,&rdquo;
Domon croaked. &ldquo;Fine right the man do have to call himself that any
longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He examined the seals and signature minutely, holding
the document close to the lamp, with his nose all but brushing the
parchment, but he could find no flaw in the one, and for the other,
he had no idea what Galldrian&rsquo;s hand looked like. If it was not the
King himself who had signed it, he suspected that whoever had had
made a good imitation of Galldrian&rsquo;s scrawl. In any case, it made
no real difference. In Tear, the letter would be instantly damning
in the hands of an Illianer. Or in Mayene, with Tairen influence so
strong. There was no war now, and men from either port came and
went freely, but there was as little love for Illianers in Tear as
the other way round. Especially with an excuse like this.</p>

<p>For a moment he thought of putting the parchment into
the lantern&rsquo;s flame&mdash;it was a dangerous thing to have, in Tear or
Illian or anywhere he could imagine&mdash;but finally he tucked it
carefully into a secret cubbyhole behind his desk, concealed by a
panel only he knew how to open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My possessions, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He collected old things, as much as he could living
on shipboard. What he could not buy, because it was too expensive
or too large, he collected by seeing and remembering. All those
remnants of times gone, those wonders scattered around the world
that had first pulled him aboard a ship as boy. He had added four
to his collection in Maradon this last trip, and it had been then
that the Darkfriend pursuit began. And Trollocs, too, for a time.
He had heard that Whitebridge had been burned to the ground right
after he sailed from there, and there had been rumors of Myrddraal
as well as Trollocs. It was that, all of it together, that had
first convinced him he was not imagining things, that had had him
on guard when that first odd commission was offered, too much money
for a simple voyage to Tear, and a thin tale for a reason.</p>

<p>Digging into his chest, he set out on the desk what
he had bought in Maradon. A lightstick, left from the Age of
Legends, or so it was said. Certainly no one knew the making of
them any longer. Expensive, that, and rarer than an honest
magistrate. It looked like a plain glass rod, thicker than his
thumb and not quite as long as his forearm, but when held in the
hand it glowed as brightly as a lantern. Lightsticks shattered like
glass, too; he had nearly lost <em>Spray</em> in the fire caused by
the first he had owned. A small, age-dark ivory carving of a man
holding a sword. The fellow who sold it claimed if you held it long
enough you started to feel warm. Domon never had, and neither had
any of the crew he let hold it, but it was old, and that was enough
for Domon. The skull of a cat as big as a lion, and so old it was
turned to stone. But no lion had ever had fangs, almost tusks, a
foot long. And a thick disk the size of a man&rsquo;s hand, half white
and half black, a sinuous line separating the colors. The
shopkeeper in Maradon had said it was from the Age of Legends,
thinking he lied, but Domon had haggled only a little before
paying, because he recognized what the shopkeeper did not: the
ancient symbol of Aes Sedai from before the Breaking of the World.
Not a safe thing to have, precisely, but neither a thing to be
passed up by a man with a fascination for the old.</p>

<p>And it was heartstone. The shopkeeper had never dared
add that to what he thought were lies. No riverfront shopkeeper in
Maradon could afford even one piece of <em>cuendillar</em>.</p>

<p>The disk felt hard and smooth in his hand, and not at
all valuable except for its age, but he was afraid it was what his
pursuers were after. Lightsticks, and ivory carvings, and even
bones turned to stone, he had seen other times, other places. Yet
even knowing what they wanted&mdash;if he did know&mdash;he still
had no idea why, and he could no longer be sure who his pursuers
were. Tar Valon marks, and an ancient Aes Sedai symbol. He scrubbed
a hand across his lips; the taste of fear lay bitter on his
tongue.</p>

<p>A knock at the door. He set the disk down and pulled
an unrolled chart over what lay on his desk. &ldquo;Come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yarin entered. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re beyond the breakwater,
Captain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Domon felt a flash of surprise, then anger with
himself. He should never have gotten so engrossed that he failed to
feel <em>Spray</em> lifting on the swells. &ldquo;Make west, Yarin. See
to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ebou Dar, Captain?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>No far enough. No by five hundred leagues</em>.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put in long enough for me to get charts and top the water
barrels, then we do sail west.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;West, Captain? Tremalking? The Sea Folk are tight
with any traders but their own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Aryth Ocean, Yarin. Plenty of trade between
Tarabon and Arad Doman, and hardly a Taraboner or Domani bottom to
worry about. They do no like the sea, I have heard. And all those
small towns on Toman Head, every one holding itself free of any
nation at all. We can even pick up Saldaean furs and ice peppers
brought down to Bandar Eban.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yarin shook his head slowly. He always looked at the
dark side, but he was a good sailor. &ldquo;Furs and peppers&rsquo;ll cost more
there than running upriver for them, Captain. And I hear there&rsquo;s
some kind of war. If Tarabon and Arad Doman are fighting, there may
be no trade. I doubt we&rsquo;ll make much off the towns on Toman Head
alone, even if they are safe. Falme&rsquo;s the largest, and it is not
big.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Taraboners and the Domani have always squabbled
over Almoth Plain and Toman Head. Even if it has come to blows this
time, a careful man can always find trade. West, Yarin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Yarin had gone topside, Domon quickly added the
black-and-white disk to the cubbyhole, and stowed the rest back in
the bottom of his chest. <em>Darkfriends or Aes Sedai, I&rsquo;ll no run
the way they want me. Fortune prick me, I&rsquo;ll no</em>.</p>

<p>Feeling safe for the first time in months, Domon went
on deck as <em>Spray</em> heeled to catch the wind and put her bow
west into the night-dark sea.</p>
