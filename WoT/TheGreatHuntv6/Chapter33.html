<h4><em>A Message From the Dark</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ave
you found it?&rdquo; Rand asked as he followed Hurin
down a cramped flight of stairs. The kitchens lay on the lower
levels, and the servants who had come attending the guests had all
been sent there. &ldquo;Or is Mat really hurt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mat&rsquo;s fine, Lord Rand.&rdquo; The sniffer frowned. &ldquo;At
least, he sounds all right, and he grumbles like a hale man. I
didn&rsquo;t mean to worry you, but I needed a reason for you to come
below. I found the trail easy enough. The men who set fire to the
inn all entered a walled garden behind the manor. Trollocs joined
them, went in to the garden with them. Sometime yesterday, I think.
Maybe even night before last.&rdquo; He hesitated. &ldquo;Lord Rand, they
didn&rsquo;t come out again. They must still be in there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the foot of the stairs the sounds of the servants
enjoying themselves drifted down the hall, laughter and singing.
Someone had a bittern, strumming a raucous tune to clapping and the
thump of dancing. There was no worked plaster or fine tapestries
here, only bare stone and plain wood. Light in the halls came from
rush torches, smoking the ceiling and spread far enough apart that
the light faded between them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you are talking to me naturally again,&rdquo;
Rand said. &ldquo;The way you have been bowing and scraping, I was
beginning to think you were more Cairhienin than the
Cairhienin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hurin&rsquo;s face colored. &ldquo;Well, as to that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He
glanced down the hall toward the noise and looked as if he wanted
to spit. &ldquo;They all pretend to be so proper, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Lord Rand,
every one of them says he&rsquo;s loyal to his master or mistress, but
they all hint they&rsquo;re willing to sell what they know, or have
heard. And when they have a few drinks in them, they&rsquo;ll tell you,
all whispering in your ear, things about the lords and ladies they
serve that&rsquo;d fair make your hair stand on end. I know they&rsquo;re
Cairhienin, but I never heard of such goings on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will be out of here soon, Hurin.&rdquo; Rand hoped it
was true. &ldquo;Where is this garden?&rdquo; Hurin turned down a side hall
leading toward the back of the manor. &ldquo;Did you bring Ingtar and the
others down already?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sniffer shook his head. &ldquo;Lord Ingtar had let
himself be cornered by six or seven of those who call themselves
ladies. I couldn&rsquo;t get close enough to speak to him. And Verin
Sedai was with Barthanes. She gave me such a look when I came near,
I never even tried to tell her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They rounded another corner just then, and there were
Loial and Mat, the Ogier standing a little stooped for the lower
ceiling.</p>

<p>Loial&rsquo;s grin almost split his face. &ldquo;There you are.
Rand, I was never so glad to get away from anyone as from those
people upstairs. They kept asking me if the Ogier were coming back,
and if Galldrian had agreed to pay what was owed. It seems the
reason all the Ogier stonemasons left is because Galldrian stopped
paying them, except with promises. I kept telling them I didn&rsquo;t
know anything about it, but half of them seemed to think that I was
lying, and the other half that I was hinting at something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be out of here soon,&rdquo; Rand assured him. &ldquo;Mat,
are you all right?&rdquo; His friend&rsquo;s face looked more hollow-cheeked
than he remembered, even back at the inn, and his cheekbones more
prominent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel fine,&rdquo; Mat said grumpily, &ldquo;but I certainly
didn&rsquo;t have any trouble leaving the <em>other</em> servants. The
ones who weren&rsquo;t asking if you starved me thought I was sick and
didn&rsquo;t want to come too close.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you sensed the dagger?&rdquo; Rand asked.</p>

<p>Mat shook his head glumly. &ldquo;The only thing I&rsquo;ve
sensed is that somebody&rsquo;s watching me, most of the time. These
people are as bad as Fades for sneaking around. Burn me, I nearly
jumped out of my skin when Hurin told me he&rsquo;d located the
Darkfriends&rsquo; trail. Rand, I can&rsquo;t feel it at all, and I&rsquo;ve been
through this bloody building from rafters to basement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That does not mean it isn&rsquo;t here, Mat. I put it in
the chest with the Horn, remember. Maybe that keeps you from
feeling it. I don&rsquo;t think Fain knows how to open it, else he&rsquo;d not
have gone to the trouble of carrying the weight when he fled Fal
Dara. Even that much gold isn&rsquo;t important beside the Horn of
Valere. When we find the Horn, we will find the dagger. You&rsquo;ll
see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As long as I don&rsquo;t have to pretend to be your
servant anymore,&rdquo; Mat muttered. &ldquo;As long as you don&rsquo;t go mad and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He let the words die with a twist of his mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand is not mad, Mat,&rdquo; Loial said. &ldquo;The Cairhienin
would never have let him in here if he were not a lord. They are
the ones who are mad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not mad,&rdquo; Rand said harshly. &ldquo;Not yet. Hurin,
show me this garden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This way, Lord Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went out into the night by a small door that
Rand had to duck to get through; Loial was forced to bend over and
hunch his shoulders. There was enough light in yellow pools from
the windows above for Rand to make out brick walks between square
flower beds. The shadows of stables and other outbuildings bulked
in the darkness to either side. Occasional fragments of music
drifted out, from the servants below or from those entertaining
their masters above.</p>

<p>Hurin led them along the walks until even the dim
glow failed and they made their way by moonlight alone, their boots
crunching softly on the brick. Bushes that would have been bright
with flowers by daylight now made strange humps in the dark. Rand
fingered his sword and did not let his eyes stay on any one spot
too long. A hundred Trollocs could be hiding around them unseen. He
knew Hurin would have smelled Trollocs if they were there, but that
did not help a great deal. If Barthanes was a Darkfriend, then at
least some of his servants and guards had to be, too, and Hurin
could not always smell a Darkfriend. Darkfriends leaping out of the
night would not be much better than Trollocs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, Lord Rand,&rdquo; Hurin whispered, pointing.</p>

<p>Ahead, stone walls not much higher than Loial&rsquo;s head
enclosed a square perhaps fifty paces on a side. Rand could not be
sure, in the shadows, but it looked as if the gardens stretched on
beyond the walls. He wondered why Barthanes had built a walled
enclosure in the middle of his garden. No roof showed above the
wall. <em>Why would they go in there and stay?</em></p>

<p>Loial bent to put his mouth close to Rand&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;I
told you this was all an Ogier grove, once. Rand, the Waygate is
within that wall. I can feel it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand heard Mat sigh despairingly. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t give up,
Mat,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not giving up. I just have enough brains not to
want to travel the Ways again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We may have to,&rdquo; Rand told him. &ldquo;Go find Ingtar and
Verin. Get them alone somehow&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care how&mdash;and
tell them I think Fain has taken the Horn through a Waygate. Just
don&rsquo;t let anyone else hear. And remember to limp; you are supposed
to have had a fall.&rdquo; It was a wonder to him that even Fain would
risk the Ways, but it seemed the only answer. <em>They wouldn&rsquo;t
spend a day and a night just sitting in there, without a roof over
their heads</em>.</p>

<p>Mat swept a low bow, and his voice was heavy with
sarcasm. &ldquo;At once, my Lord. As my Lord wishes. Shall I carry your
banner, my Lord?&rdquo; He started back for the manor, his grumbles
fading away. &ldquo;Now I have to limp. Next it&rsquo;ll be a broken neck, or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just worried about the dagger, Rand,&rdquo; Loial
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Rand said. <em>But how long before he tells
somebody what I am, not even meaning to?</em> He could not believe
Mat would betray him on purpose; there was that much of their
friendship left, at least. &ldquo;Loial, boost me up where I can see over
the wall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand, if the Darkfriends are still&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t. Boost me up, Loial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three of them moved close to the wall, and Loial
made a stirrup with his hands for Rand&rsquo;s foot. The Ogier
straightened easily with the weight, lifting Rand&rsquo;s head just high
enough to see over the top of the wall.</p>

<p>The thin, waning moon gave little light, and most of
the area was in shadow, but there did not seem to be any flowers or
shrubs inside the walled square. Only a lone bench of pale marble,
placed as if one man might sit on it to stare at what stood in the
middle of the space like a huge upright stone slab.</p>

<p>Rand caught the top of the wall and pulled himself
up. Loial gave a low <em>hsst</em> and grabbed at his foot, but he
jerked free and rolled over the wall, dropping inside. There was
close-cropped grass under his feet; he thought vaguely that
Barthanes must let sheep in, at least. Staring at the shadowed
stone slab, the Waygate, he was startled to hear boots thump to the
ground beside him.</p>

<p>Hurin climbed to his feet, dusting himself off. &ldquo;You
should be careful doing that, Lord Rand. Could be anybody hiding in
here. Or anything.&rdquo; He peered into the darkness within the walls,
feeling at his belt as if for the short sword and sword-breaker he
had had to leave at the inn; servants did not go armed in Cairhien.
&ldquo;Jump in a hole without looking, and there&rsquo;ll be a snake in it
every time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would smell them,&rdquo; Rand said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo; The sniffer inhaled deeply. &ldquo;But I can only
smell what they&rsquo;ve done, not what they intend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a scraping sound from over Rand&rsquo;s head, and
then Loial was letting himself down from the wall. The Ogier did
not even have to straighten his arms completely before his boots
touched the ground. &ldquo;Rash,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;You humans are always so
rash and hasty. And now you have me doing it. Elder Haman would
speak to me severely, and my mother&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; The darkness hid his
face, but Rand was sure his ears were twitching vigorously. &ldquo;Rand,
if you don&rsquo;t start being a little careful, you are going to get me
in trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand walked to the Waygate, walked all the way around
it. Even close up it looked like nothing more than a thick square
of stone, taller than he was. The back was smooth and cool to the
touch&mdash;he only brushed his hand against it quickly&mdash;but
the front had been carved by an artist&rsquo;s hands. Vines, leaves, and
flowers covered it, each so finely done that in the dim moonlight
they seemed almost real. He felt the ground in front of it; the
grass had been scraped partly away in two arcs such as those gates
would make in opening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that a Waygate?&rdquo; Hurin asked uncertainly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
heard tell of them, of course, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He sniffed the air. &ldquo;The
trail goes right to it and stops, Lord Rand. How are we going to
follow them, now? I&rsquo;ve heard if you go through a Waygate, you come
out mad, if you come out at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can be done, Hurin. I&rsquo;ve done it, and Loial, and
Mat and Perrin.&rdquo; Rand never took his eyes from the tangles of
leaves on the stone. There was one unlike any other carved there,
he knew. The trefoil leaf of fabled <em>Avendesora</em>, the Tree
of Life. He put his hand on it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you can smell their trail
along the Ways. We can follow anywhere they can run.&rdquo; It would not
hurt to prove to himself that he could make himself step through a
Waygate. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll prove it to you.&rdquo; He heard Hurin groan. The leaf was
worked in the stone just as the others were, but it came away in
his hand. Loial groaned, too.</p>

<p>In an instant the illusion of living plants seemed
suddenly real. Stone leaves appeared to stir with a breeze, flowers
appeared to have color even in the dark. Down the center of the
mass a line appeared, and the two halves of the slab swung slowly
toward Rand. He stepped back to let them open. He did not find
himself looking at the other side of the walled square, but neither
did he see the dull silver reflection he remembered. The space
between the opening gates was a black so dark it seemed to make the
night around it lighter. The pitch-blackness oozed out between the
still-moving gates.</p>

<p>Rand leaped back with a shout, dropping the <em>
Avendesora</em> leaf in his haste, and Loial cried out, &ldquo;<em>Machin
Shin</em>. The Black Wind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sound of wind filled their ears; the grass
stirred in ripples toward the walls, and dirt swirled up, sucked
into the air. And in the wind a thousand insane voices seemed to
cry, ten thousand, overlapping, drowning each other. Rand could
make out some of them, though he tried not to.</p>

<p>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>blood so sweet, so sweet to drink the
blood, the blood that drips, drips, drops so red; pretty eyes, fine
eyes, I have no eyes, pluck the eyes from out of your head; grind
your bones, split your bones inside your flesh, suck your marrow
while you scream; scream, scream, singing screams, sing your
screams</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;And worst of all, a whispering thread through
all the rest. <em>Al&rsquo;Thor. Al&rsquo;Thor. Al&rsquo;Thor</em>.</p>

<p>Rand found the void around him and embraced it, never
minding the tantalizing, sickening glow of <em>saidin</em> just out
of his sight. Greatest of all the dangers along the Ways was the
Black Wind that took the souls of those it killed, and drove mad
those it let live, but <em>Machin Shin</em> was a part of the Ways;
it could not leave them. Only it was flowing into the night, and
the Black Wind called his name.</p>

<p>The Waygate was not yet fully open. If they could
only put the <em>Avendesora</em> leaf back&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He saw Loial
scrambling on his hands and knees, fumbling and searching the grass
in the darkness.</p>

<p><em>Saidin</em> filled him. He felt as if his bones
were vibrating, felt the red-hot, ice-cold flow of the One Power,
felt truly alive as he never was without it, felt the oil-slick
taint&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>No!</em> And silently he screamed back at himself
from beyond the emptiness, <em>It&rsquo;s coming for you! It&rsquo;ll kill all
of us!</em> He hurled it all at the black bulge, standing out a
full span from the Waygate, now. He did not know what it was that
he hurled, or how, but in the heart of that darkness bloomed a
coruscating fountain of light.</p>

<p>The Black Wind shrieked, ten thousand wordless howls
of agony. Slowly, giving way inch by reluctant inch, the bulge
lessened; slowly the oozing reversed, back into the still-open
Waygate.</p>

<p>The Power raced through Rand in a torrent. He could
feel the link between himself and <em>saidin</em>, like a river in
flood, between himself and the pure fire blazing in the heart of
the Black Wind, a raging cataract. The heat inside him went to
white-heat, and beyond, to a shimmer that would have melted stone
and vaporized steel and made the air burst into flame. The cold
grew till the breath in his lungs should have frozen solid and hard
as metal. He could feel it overwhelming him, feel life eroding like
a soft clay riverbank, feel what was him wearing away.</p>

<p><em>Can&rsquo;t stop! If it gets out</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Have to
kill it!</em> <em>I</em>&mdash;<em>can</em>&mdash;<em>not</em>&mdash;<em>stop!</em> Desperately he clung to fragments of himself.
The One Power roared through him; he rode it like a chip of wood in
rapids. The void began to melt and flow; the emptiness steamed with
freezing cold.</p>

<p>The motion of the Waygate halted, and reversed.</p>

<p>Rand stared, sure, in the dim thoughts floating
outside the void, that he was only seeing what he wanted to
see.</p>

<p>The gates drifted closer together, pushing back <em>
Machin Shin</em> as if the Black Wind had solid substance. The
inferno still roared in its breast.</p>

<p>With a vague, distant wondering, Rand saw Loial,
still on hands and knees, backing away from the closing gates.</p>

<p>The gap narrowed, vanished. The leaves and vines
merged into a solid wall, and were stone.</p>

<p>Rand felt the link between him and the fire snap, the
flow of Power through him cease. A moment more, and it would have
swept him away completely. Shaking, he dropped to his knees. It was
still there inside. <em>Saidin</em>. No longer flowing, but there,
in a pool. He was a pool of the One Power. He trembled with it. He
could smell the grass, the dirt beneath, the stone of the walls.
Even in the darkness he could see each blade of grass, separate and
whole, all of them at once. He could feel each minute stirring of
the air on his face. His tongue curdled with the taste of the
taint; his stomach knotted and spasmed.</p>

<p>Frantically he clawed his way out of the void; still
on his knees, not moving, he fought free. And then all that was
left was the fading foulness on his tongue, and the cramping in his
stomach, and the memory. <em>So</em>&mdash;<em>alive</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You saved us, Builder.&rdquo; Hurin had his back pressed
against the wall, and his voice was hoarse. &ldquo;That thing&mdash;that
was the Black Wind?&mdash;it was worse than&mdash;was it going to
hurl that fire at us? Lord Rand! Did it harm you? Did it touch
you?&rdquo; He came running as Rand got to his feet, helping him the last
bit. Loial was getting up, too, dusting his hands and his
knees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never follow Fain through that.&rdquo; Rand touched
Loial&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Thank you. You did save us.&rdquo; <em>You saved me, at
least. It was killing me. Killing me, and it felt</em>&mdash;<em>
wonderful</em>. He swallowed; a faint trace of the taste still
coated his mouth. &ldquo;I want something to drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only found the leaf and put it back,&rdquo; Loial said,
shrugging. &ldquo;It seemed that if we could not get the Waygate closed,
it would kill us. I am afraid I&rsquo;m not a very good hero, Rand. I was
so afraid I could hardly think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were both afraid,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;We may be a poor
pair of heroes, but we are what there is. It&rsquo;s a good thing Ingtar
is with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord Rand,&rdquo; Hurin said diffidently, &ldquo;could we&mdash;leave, now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sniffer made a fuss about Rand going over the
wall first, with not knowing who was waiting outside, until Rand
pointed out that he had the only weapon among them. Even then Hurin
did not seem to like letting Loial lift Rand to catch the top of
the wall and pull himself over.</p>

<p>Rand landed on his feet with a thud, listening and
peering into the night. For a moment he thought he saw something
move, heard a boot scrape on the brick walk, but neither was
repeated, and he dismissed it as nervousness. He thought that he
had a right to be nervous. He turned to help Hurin down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord Rand,&rdquo; the sniffer said as soon as his feet
were solidly on the ground, &ldquo;how are we going to follow them now?
From what I&rsquo;ve heard of those things, the whole lot of them could
be halfway across the world by now, in any direction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Verin will know a way.&rdquo; Rand suddenly wanted to
laugh; to find the Horn and the dagger&mdash;if they could be
found, now&mdash;he had to go back to the Aes Sedai. They had let
him loose, and now he had to go back. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let Mat die without
trying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial joined them, and they went back toward the
manor, to be met at the small door by Mat, who opened it just as
Rand reached for the handle. &ldquo;Verin says you&rsquo;re not to do anything.
If Hurin&rsquo;s found where the Horn is kept, then she says that&rsquo;s all
we can do, now. She says we&rsquo;ll leave as soon as you come back, and
make a plan. And I say this is the last time I go running back and
forth with messages. If you want to say something to somebody, you
can talk to them yourself from now on.&rdquo; Mat peered past them into
the darkness. &ldquo;Is the Horn out there somewhere? In an outbuilding?
Did you see the dagger?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand turned him around and got him back inside. &ldquo;It
isn&rsquo;t in an outbuilding, Mat. I hope Verin has a good idea of what
to do now; I don&rsquo;t have any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat looked as if he wanted to ask questions, but he
let himself be pushed along the dimly lit corridor. He even
remembered to limp as they started upstairs.</p>

<p>When Rand and the others reentered the rooms filled
with nobles, they received a number of looks. Rand wondered if they
somehow knew something of what had happened outside, or if he
should have sent Hurin and Mat to the front hall to wait, but then
he realized the looks were no different from what they had been
before, curious and calculating, wondering what the lord and the
Ogier had been up to. Servants were invisible to these people. No
one tried to approach them, since they were together. It seemed
there were protocols to conspiracy in the Great Game; anyone might
try to listen to a private conversation, but they would not intrude
on it.</p>

<p>Verin and Ingtar were standing together, and thus
also alone. Ingtar looked a little dazed. Verin gave Rand and the
other three a brief glance, frowned at their expressions, then
resettled her shawl and started for the entry hall.</p>

<p>As they reached it, Barthanes appeared as if someone
had told him they were leaving. &ldquo;You go so soon? Verin Sedai, can I
not entreat you to stay longer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verin shook her head. &ldquo;We must go, Lord Barthanes.
I&rsquo;ve not been in Cairhien in some years. I was glad of your
invitation to young Rand. It has been&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;interesting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Grace see you safely to your inn. The Great
Tree, is it not? Perhaps you will favor me with your presence
again? You would honor me, Verin Sedai, and you, Lord Rand, and
you, Lord Ingtar, not to mention you, Loial, son of Arent son of
Halan.&rdquo; His bow was a little deeper for the Aes Sedai than for the
others, but still no more than a slight inclination.</p>

<p>Verin nodded in acknowledgment. &ldquo;Perhaps. The Light
illumine you, Lord Barthanes.&rdquo; She turned for the doors.</p>

<p>As Rand moved to follow the others, Barthanes caught
his sleeve with two fingers, holding him back. Mat looked as if he
might stay, too, until Hurin pulled him to join Verin and the
rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wade even deeper in the Game than I thought,&rdquo;
Barthanes said softly. &ldquo;When I heard your name, I could not believe
it, yet you came, and you fit the description, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I was
given a message for you. I think I will deliver it after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand had felt a prickling along his backbone as
Barthanes spoke, but at the last, he stared. &ldquo;A message? From whom?
Lady Selene?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man. Not the sort for whom I would usually carry
messages, but he has&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;certain&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;claims on me that I cannot
ignore. He gave no name, but he was a Lugarder. Aaah! You know
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know him.&rdquo; <em>Fain left a message?</em> Rand
looked around the wide hall. Mat and Verin and the others were
waiting by the doors. Liveried servants stood stiffly along the
walls, ready to leap at a command yet appearing neither to hear nor
see. The sounds of the gathering floated from deeper in the manor.
It did not look like a place where Darkfriends might attack. &ldquo;What
message?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He says he will wait for you on Toman Head. He has
what you seek, and if you want it, you must follow. If you refuse
to follow him, he says he will hound your blood, and your people,
and those you love until you will face him. It sounds mad, of
course, a man like that saying he will hound a lord, and yet, there
was something about him. I think he is mad&mdash;he even denied
you are a lord, as any eye can plainly see&mdash;but there is
still something. What is it he carries with him, with Trollocs to
guard it? What is it you seek?&rdquo; Barthanes seemed shocked at the
directness of his own questions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light illumine you, Lord Barthanes.&rdquo; Rand
managed a bow, but his legs wobbled as he joined Verin and the
others. <em>He</em> wants <em>me to follow? And he&rsquo;ll hurt Emond&rsquo;s
Field, Tam, if I don&rsquo;t</em>. He had no doubt Fain could do it,
would do it. <em>At least Egwene is safe, in the White Tower</em>.
He had sickening images of Trollocs descending in hordes on Emond&rsquo;s
Field, of eyeless Fades stalking Egwene. <em>But how can I follow
him? How?</em></p>

<p>Then he was out in the night, mounting Red. Verin and
Ingtar and the others were all already on their horses, and the
escort of Shienarans was closing round them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you find?&rdquo; Verin demanded. &ldquo;Where does he
keep it?&rdquo; Hurin cleared his throat loudly, and Loial shifted in his
high saddle. The Aes Sedai peered at them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fain has taken the Horn to Toman Head through a
Waygate,&rdquo; Rand said dully. &ldquo;By this time, he&rsquo;s probably already
waiting there for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will speak of this later,&rdquo; Verin said, so firmly
that no one spoke at all on the ride back to the city, to The Great
Tree.</p>

<p>Uno left them there, after a quiet word from Ingtar,
taking the soldiers back to their inn in the Foregate. Hurin took
one look at Verin&rsquo;s set face by the light of the common room,
muttered something about ale, and scurried to a table in a corner,
alone. The Aes Sedai brushed aside the innkeeper&rsquo;s solicitous hopes
that she had enjoyed herself, and silently led Rand and the rest to
the private dining room.</p>

<p>Perrin looked up from <em>The Travels of Jain
Farstrider</em> when they walked in, and frowned when he saw their
faces. &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t go well, did it?&rdquo; he said, closing the
leatherbound book. Lamps and beeswax candles around the room gave a
good light; Mistress Tiedra charged heavily, but she did not
stint.</p>

<p>Verin carefully folded her shawl and laid it across
the back of a chair. &ldquo;Tell me again. The Darkfriends took the Horn
through a <em>Waygate</em>? At Barthanes&rsquo;s manor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ground under the manor used to be an Ogier
grove,&rdquo; Loial explained. &ldquo;When we built&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; His voice trailed
off and his ears wilted under her look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurin followed them right to it.&rdquo; Rand wearily threw
himself into a chair. <em>I have to follow more than ever, now. But
how?</em> &ldquo;I opened it to show him he could still follow the trail
wherever they went, and the Black Wind was there. It tried to reach
us, but Loial managed to close the gates before it could come all
the way out.&rdquo; He colored a little at that, but Loial <em>had</em>
closed the gates, and for all he knew <em>Machin Shin</em> might
have made it out without that. &ldquo;It was standing guard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Black Wind,&rdquo; Mat breathed, frozen halfway into a
chair. Perrin was staring at Rand, too. So were Verin and Ingtar.
Mat dropped into the chair with a thump.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be mistaken,&rdquo; Verin said at last.
&ldquo;<em>Machin Shin</em> could not be used as a guard. No one can
constrain the Black Wind to do anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a creature of the Dark One,&rdquo; Mat said numbly.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re Darkfriends. Maybe they knew how to ask it for help, or
make it help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one knows exactly what <em>Machin Shin</em> is,&rdquo;
Verin said, &ldquo;unless, perhaps, it is the essence of madness and
cruelty. It cannot be reasoned with, Mat, or bargained with, or
talked to. It cannot even be forced, not by any Aes Sedai living
today, and perhaps not by any who ever lived. Do you really think
Padan Fain could do what ten Aes Sedai could not?&rdquo; Mat shook his
head.</p>

<p>There was an air of despair in the room, of hope and
purpose lost. The goal they had sought had vanished, and even
Verin&rsquo;s face wore a floundering expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d never have thought Fain had the courage for the
Ways.&rdquo; Ingtar sounded almost mild, but suddenly he banged his fist
against the wall. &ldquo;I do not care how, or even if, <em>Machin
Shin</em> works on Fain&rsquo;s behalf. They have taken the Horn of
Valere into the Ways, Aes Sedai. By now they could be in the
Blight, or halfway to Tear or Tanchico, or the other side of the
Aiel Waste. The Horn is lost. I am lost.&rdquo; His hands dropped to his
sides, and his shoulders slumped. &ldquo;I am lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fain is taking it to Toman Head,&rdquo; Rand said, and was
immediately the object of all eyes again.</p>

<p>Verin studied him narrowly. &ldquo;You said that before.
How do you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He left a message with Barthanes,&rdquo; Rand said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A trick,&rdquo; Ingtar sneered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d not tell us where to
follow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what the rest of you are going to do,&rdquo;
Rand said, &ldquo;but I am going to Toman Head. I have to. I leave at
first light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Rand,&rdquo; Loial said, &ldquo;it will take us months to
reach Toman Head. What makes you think Fain will wait there for
us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will wait.&rdquo; <em>But how long before he decides
I&rsquo;m not coming? Why did he set that guard if he wants me to
follow?</em> &ldquo;Loial, I mean to ride as hard as I can, and if I ride
Red to death, I&rsquo;ll buy another horse, or steal another, if I have
to. Are you sure you want to come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve stayed with you this long, Rand. Why would I
stop now?&rdquo; Loial pulled out his pipe and pouch and began thumbing
tabac into the big bowl. &ldquo;You see, I like you. I would like you
even if you weren&rsquo;t <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>. Maybe I like you despite it.
You do seem to get me neck-deep in hot water. In any case, I am
going with you.&rdquo; He sucked on the pipestem to test the draw, then
took a splinter from the stone jar on the mantel and thrust it into
a candle flame for a light. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t think you can really stop
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; Mat said. &ldquo;Fain still has that
dagger, so I&rsquo;m going. But all that servant business ended
tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin sighed, an introspective look in his yellow
eyes. &ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;ll come along, too.&rdquo; After a moment, he grinned.
&ldquo;Somebody has to keep Mat out of trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not even a clever trick,&rdquo; Ingtar muttered. &ldquo;Somehow,
I&rsquo;ll get Barthanes alone, and I will learn the truth. I mean to
have the Horn of Valere, not chase Jak o&rsquo; the Wisps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may not be a trick,&rdquo; Verin said carefully,
seeming to study the floor under her toes. &ldquo;There were certain
things left in the dungeons at Fal Dara, writings that indicated a
connection between what happened that night and&rdquo;&mdash;she gave
Rand a quick glance under lowered brows&mdash;&ldquo;Toman Head. I still
do not understand them completely, but I believe we must go to
Toman Head. And I believe we will find the Horn there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if they are going to Toman Head,&rdquo; Ingtar said,
&ldquo;by the time we reach it, Fain or one of the other Darkfriends
could have blown the Horn a hundred times, and the heroes returned
from the grave will ride for the Shadow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fain could have blown the Horn a hundred times since
leaving Fal Dara,&rdquo; Verin told him. &ldquo;And I think he would have, if
he could open the chest. What we must worry about is that he might
find someone who does know how to open it. We must follow him along
the Ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin&rsquo;s head came up sharply, and Mat shifted in his
chair. Loial gave a low moan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if we could somehow sneak past Barthanes&rsquo;s
guards,&rdquo; Rand said, &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll find <em>Machin Shin</em> still
there. We cannot use the Ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many of us could sneak onto Barthanes&rsquo;s
grounds?&rdquo; Verin said dismissively. &ldquo;There are other Waygates.
Stedding Tsofu lies not far from the city, south and east. It is a
young <em>stedding</em>, rediscovered only perhaps six hundred
years ago, but the Ogier Elders were still growing the Ways, then.
Stedding Tsofu will have a Waygate. It is there and we will ride at
first light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial made a slightly louder sound, and Rand was not
sure whether it referred to the Waygate or the <em>
stedding</em>.</p>

<p>Ingtar still did not seem convinced, but Verin was as
smooth and as implacable as snow sliding down a mountainside. &ldquo;You
will have your soldiers ready to ride, Ingtar. Send Hurin to tell
Uno before he goes to bed. I think we should all go to bed as soon
as possible. These Darkfriends have gained at least a day on us
already, and I mean to make up as much of it as I can tomorrow.&rdquo; So
firm was the plump Aes Sedai&rsquo;s manner that she was already herding
Ingtar to the door before she finished speaking.</p>

<p>Rand followed the others out, but at the door he
stopped beside the Aes Sedai and watched Mat heading down the
candle-lit hall. &ldquo;Why does he look like that?&rdquo; he asked her. &ldquo;I
thought you Healed him, enough to give him some time, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She waited until Mat and the others had turned up the
stairs before speaking. &ldquo;Apparently, it did not work so well as we
believed. The sickness takes an interesting course in him. His
strength remains; he will keep that to the end, I think. But his
body wastes away. Another few weeks, at most, I would say. You see,
there is reason for haste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not need another spur, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Rand said,
making the title sound hard. <em>Mat. The Horn. Fain&rsquo;s threat.
Light, Egwene! Burn me, I don&rsquo;t need another spur</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what of you, Rand al&rsquo;Thor? Do you feel well? Do
you fight it still, or have you yet surrendered to the Wheel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ride with you to find the Horn,&rdquo; he told her.
&ldquo;Beyond that, there is nothing between me and any Aes Sedai. Do you
understand me? Nothing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not speak, and he walked away from her, but
when he turned to take the stairs she was still watching him, dark
eyes sharp and considering.</p>
