<h4><em>Seanchan</em></h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">G</span>eofram
Bornhald ignored the smell of burning houses
and the bodies that lay sprawled on the dirt of the street. Byar
and a white-cloaked guard of a hundred rode into the village at his
heels, half the men he had with him. His legion was too scattered
for his liking, with Questioners having too many of the commands,
but his orders had been explicit: Obey the Questioners.</p>

<p>There had been but slight resistance here; only half
a dozen dwellings gave off columns of smoke. The inn was still
standing, he saw, white-plastered stone like almost every structure
on Almoth Plain.</p>

<p>Reining up before the inn, his eyes went past the
prisoners his soldiers held near the village well to the long
gibbet marring the village green. It was hastily made, only a long
pole on uprights, but it held thirty bodies, their clothes ruffled
by the breeze. There were small bodies hanging among their elders.
Even Byar stared at that in disbelief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Muadh!&rdquo; he roared. A grizzled man trotted away from
those holding the prisoners. Muadh had fallen into the hands of
Darkfriends, once; his scarred face took even the strongest aback.
&ldquo;Is this your work, Muadh, or the Seanchan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither, my Lord Captain.&rdquo; Muadh&rsquo;s voice was a
hoarse, whispered growl, another leaving of the Darkfriends. He
said no more.</p>

<p>Bornhald frowned. &ldquo;Surely that lot did not do it,&rdquo; he
said, gesturing to the prisoners. The Children did not look so neat
as when he had brought them across Tarabon, but they seemed ready
to parade compared with the rabble that crouched under their
watchful eyes. Men in rags and bits of armor, with sullen faces.
Remnants of the army Tarabon had sent against the invaders on Toman
Head.</p>

<p>Muadh hesitated, then said carefully, &ldquo;The villagers
say they wore Taraboner cloaks, my Lord Captain. There was a big
man among them, with gray eyes and a long mustache, that sounds
twin to Child Earwin, and a young lad, trying to hide a pretty face
behind a yellow beard, who fought with his left hand. Sounds almost
like Child Wuan, my Lord Captain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Questioners!&rdquo; Bornhald spat. Earwin and Wuan were
among those he had had to hand over to the Questioners&rsquo; command. He
had seen Questioner tactics before, but this was the first time he
had ever been faced with children&rsquo;s bodies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If my Lord Captain says so.&rdquo; Muadh made it sound
like fervent agreement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cut them down,&rdquo; Bornhald said wearily. &ldquo;Cut them
down, and make sure the villagers know there will be no more
killing.&rdquo; <em>Unless some fool decides to be brave because his
woman is watching, and I have to make an example</em>. He
dismounted, eyeing the prisoners again, as Muadh hurried off
calling for ladders and knives. He had more to think about than
Questioners&rsquo; overzealousness; he wished he could stop thinking
about Questioners altogether.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They do not put up much fight, my Lord Captain,&rdquo;
Byar said, &ldquo;either these Taraboners or what is left of the Domani.
They snap like cornered rats, but run as soon as anything snaps
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us see how we do against the invaders, Byar,
before we look down on these men, yes?&rdquo; The prisoners&rsquo; faces bore a
defeated look that had been there before his men came. &ldquo;Have Muadh
pick one out for me.&rdquo; Muadh&rsquo;s face was enough to soften most men&rsquo;s
resolve by itself. &ldquo;An officer, preferably. One who looks
intelligent enough to tell what he has seen without embroidery, but
young enough not to have yet grown a full backbone. Tell Muadh to
be not too gentle about it, yes? Make the fellow believe that I
mean to see worse happen to him than he ever dreamed of, unless he
convinces me otherwise.&rdquo; He tossed his reins to one of the Children
and strode into the inn.</p>

<p>The innkeeper was there, for a wonder, an obsequious,
sweating man, his dirty shirt straining over his belly until the
embroidered red scrollwork seemed ready to pop off. Bornhald waved
the man away; he was vaguely aware of a woman and some children
huddling in a doorway, until the fat innkeeper shepherded them
out.</p>

<p>Bornhald pulled off his gauntlets and sat at one of
the tables. He knew too little about the invaders, the strangers.
That was what almost everyone called them, those who did not just
babble about Artur Hawkwing. He knew they called themselves the
Seanchan, and <em>Hailene</em>. He had enough of the Old Tongue to
know the latter meant Those Who Come Before, or the Forerunners.
They also called themselves <em>Rhyagelle</em>, Those Who Come
Home, and spoke of <em>Corenne</em>, the Return. It was almost
enough to make him believe the tales of Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s armies
come back. No one knew where the Seanchan had come from, other than
that they had landed in ships. Bornhald&rsquo;s requests for information
from the Sea Folk had been met with silence. Amador did not hold
the Atha&rsquo;an Miere in good favor, and the attitude was returned with
interest. All he knew of the Seanchan he had heard from men like
those outside. Broken, beaten rabble who spoke, wide-eyed and
sweating, of men who came into battle riding monsters as often as
horses, who fought with monsters by their sides, and brought Aes
Sedai to rend the earth under their enemies&rsquo; feet.</p>

<p>A sound of boots in the doorway made him put on a
wolfish grin, but Byar was not accompanied by Muadh. The Child of
the Light who stood beside him, back braced and helmet in the crook
of his arm, was Jeral, who Bornhald expected to be a hundred miles
away. Over his armor, the young man wore a cloak of Domani cut,
trimmed with blue, not the white cloak of the Children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Muadh is talking to a young fellow now, my Lord
Captain,&rdquo; Byar said. &ldquo;Child Jeral has just ridden in with a
message.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bornhald waved for Jeral to begin.</p>

<p>The young man did not unbend. &ldquo;The compliments of
Jaichim Carridin,&rdquo; he started, looking straight ahead, &ldquo;who guides
the Hand of the Light in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no need of the Questioner&rsquo;s compliments,&rdquo;
Bornhald growled, and saw the young man&rsquo;s startled look. Jeral was
young, yet. For that matter, Byar looked uncomfortable, as well.
&ldquo;You will give me his message, yes? Not word for word, unless I ask
it. Simply tell me what he wants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Child, set to recite, swallowed before he began.
&ldquo;My Lord Captain, he&mdash;he says you are moving too many men too
close to Toman Head. He says the Darkfriends on Almoth Plain must
be rooted out, and you are&mdash;forgive me, Lord Captain&mdash;you are to turn back at once and ride toward the heart of the
plain.&rdquo; He stood stiffly, waiting.</p>

<p>Bornhald studied him. The dust of the plain stained
Jeral&rsquo;s face as well as his cloak and his boots. &ldquo;Go and get
yourself something to eat,&rdquo; Bornhald told him. &ldquo;There should be
wash water in one of these houses, if you wish it. Return to me in
an hour. I will have messages for you to carry.&rdquo; He waved the young
man out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Questioners may be right, my Lord Captain,&rdquo; Byar
said when Jeral was gone. &ldquo;There are many villages scattered on the
plain, and the Darkfriends&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bornhald&rsquo;s hand slapping the table cut him off. &ldquo;What
Darkfriends? I have seen nothing in any village he has ordered
taken except farmers and craftsmen worried that we will burn their
livelihoods, and a few old women who tend the sick.&rdquo; Byar&rsquo;s face
was a study in lack of expression; he was always readier than
Bornhald to see Darkfriends. &ldquo;And children, Byar? Do children here
become Darkfriends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sins of the mother are visited to the fifth
generation,&rdquo; Byar quoted, &ldquo;and the sins of the father to the
tenth.&rdquo; But he looked uneasy. Even Byar had never killed a
child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has it never occurred to you, Byar, to wonder why
Carridin has taken away our banners, and the cloaks of the
men the Questioners lead? Even the Questioners themselves have put
off the white. This suggests something, yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must have his reasons, Lord Captain,&rdquo; Byar said
slowly. &ldquo;The Questioners always have reasons, even when they do not
tell the rest of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bornhald reminded himself that Byar was a good
soldier. &ldquo;Children to the north wear Taraboner cloaks, Byar, and
those to the south Domani. I do not like what this suggests to me.
There are Darkfriends here, but they are in Falme, not on the
plain. When Jeral rides, he will not ride alone. Messages will go
to every group of the Children I know how to find. I mean to take
the legion onto Toman Head, Byar, and see what the true
Darkfriends, these Seanchan, are up to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Byar looked troubled, but before he could speak,
Muadh appeared with one of the prisoners. The sweating young man in
a battered, ornate breastplate shot frightened looks at Muadh&rsquo;s
hideous face.</p>

<p>Bornhald drew his dagger and began trimming his
nails. He had never understood why that made some men nervous, but
he used it just the same. Even his grandfatherly smile made the
prisoner&rsquo;s dirty face pale. &ldquo;Now, young man, you will tell me
everything you know about these strangers, yes? If you need to
think on what to say, I will send you back out with Child Muadh to
consider it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prisoner darted a wide-eyed look at Muadh. Then
words began to pour out of him.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The long swells of the Aryth Ocean made <em>
Spray</em> roll, but Domon&rsquo;s spread feet balanced him as he held
the long tube of the looking glass to his eye and studied the large
vessel that pursued them. Pursued, and was slowly overtaking. The
wind where <em>Spray</em> ran was not the best or the strongest,
but where the other ship smashed the swells into mountains of foam
with its bluff bow, it could not have blown better. The coastline
of Toman Head loomed to the east, dark cliffs and narrow strips of
sand. He had not cared to take <em>Spray</em> too far out, and now
he feared he might pay for it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strangers, Captain?&rdquo; Yarin had the sound of sweat in
his voice. &ldquo;Is it a strangers&rsquo; ship?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Domon lowered the looking glass, but his eye still
seemed filled by that tall, square-looking ship with its odd ribbed
sails. &ldquo;Seanchan,&rdquo; he said, and heard Yarin groan. He drummed his
thick fingers on the rail, then told the helmsman, &ldquo;Take her closer
in. That ship will no dare enter the shallow waters <em>Spray</em>
can sail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yarin shouted commands, and crewmen ran to haul in
booms as the helmsman put the tiller over, pointing the bow more
toward the shoreline. <em>Spray</em> moved more slowly, heading so
far into the wind, but Domon was sure he could reach shoal waters
before the other vessel came up on him. <em>Did her holds be full,
she could still take shallower water than ever that great hull
can</em>.</p>

<p>His ship rode a little higher in the water than she
had on sailing from Tanchico. A third of the cargo of fireworks he
had taken on there was gone, sold in the fishing villages on Toman
Head, but with the silver that flowed for the fireworks had come
disturbing reports. The people spoke of visits from the tall, boxy
ships of the invaders. When Seanchan ships anchored off the coast,
the villagers who drew up to defend their homes were rent by
lightning from the sky while small boats were still ferrying the
invaders ashore, and the earth erupted in fire under their feet.
Domon had thought he was hearing nonsense until he was shown the
blackened ground, and he had seen it in too many villages to doubt
any longer. Monsters fought beside the Seanchan soldiers, not that
there was ever much resistance left, the villagers said, and some
even claimed that the Seanchan themselves were monsters, with heads
like huge insects.</p>

<p>In Tanchico, no one had even known what they called
themselves, and the Taraboners spoke confidently of their soldiers
driving the invaders into the sea. But in every coastal town, it
was different. The Seanchan told astonished people they must swear
again oaths they had forsaken, though never deigning to explain
when they had forsaken them, or what the oaths meant. The young
women were taken away one by one to be examined, and some were
carried aboard the ships and never seen again. A few older women
had also vanished, some of the Guides and Healers. New mayors were
chosen by the Seanchan, and new Councils, and any who protested the
disappearances of the women or having no voice in the choosing
might be hung, or burst suddenly into flame, or be brushed aside
like yapping dogs. There was no way of telling which it would be
until it was too late.</p>

<p>And when the people had been thoroughly cowed, when
they had been made to kneel and swear, bewildered, to obey the
Forerunners, await the Return, and serve Those Who Come Home with
their lives, the Seanchan sailed away and usually never returned.
Falme, it was said, was the only town they held fast.</p>

<p>In some of the villages they had left, men and women
crept back toward their former lives, to the extent of talking
about electing their Councils again, but most eyed the sea
nervously and made pale-cheeked protests that they meant to hold to
the oaths they had been made to swear even if they did not
understand them.</p>

<p>Domon had no intention of meeting any Seanchan, if he
could avoid it.</p>

<p>He was raising the glass to see what he could make
out on the nearing Seanchan decks, when, with a roar, the surface
of the sea broke into fountaining water and flame not a hundred
paces from his larboard side. Before he had even begun to gape,
another column of flame split the sea on the other side, and as he
was spinning to stare at that, another burst up ahead. The
eruptions died as quickly as they were born, spray from
them blown across the deck. Where they had been, the sea bubbled
and steamed as if boiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;we&rsquo;ll reach shallow water before they can
close with us,&rdquo; Yarin said slowly. He seemed to be trying not to
look at the water roiling under clouds of mist.</p>

<p>Domon shook his head. &ldquo;Whatever they did, they can
shatter us, even do I take her into the breakers.&rdquo; He shivered,
thinking of the flame inside the fountains of water, and his holds
full of fireworks. &ldquo;Fortune prick me, we might no live to drown.&rdquo;
He tugged at his beard and rubbed his bare upper lip, reluctant to
give the order&mdash;the vessel and what it contained were all he had in
the world&mdash;but finally he made himself speak. &ldquo;Bring her into the
wind, Yarin, and down sail. Quickly, man, quickly! Before they do
think we still try to escape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As crewmen ran to lower the triangular sails, Domon
turned to watch the Seanchan ship approach. <em>Spray</em> lost
headway and pitched in the swells. The other vessel stood taller
above the water than Domon&rsquo;s ship, with wooden towers at bow and
stern. Men were in the rigging, raising those strange sails, and
armored figures stood atop the towers. A longboat was put over the
side, and sped toward <em>Spray</em> under ten oars. It carried
armored shapes, and&mdash;Domon frowned in surprise&mdash;two
women crouched in the stern. The longboat thumped against <em>
Spray</em>&rsquo;s hull.</p>

<p>The first to climb up was one of the armored men, and
Domon saw immediately why some of the villagers claimed the
Seanchan themselves were monsters. The helmet looked very much like
some monstrous insect&rsquo;s head, with thin red plumes like feelers;
the wearer seemed to be peering out through mandibles. It was
painted and gilded to increase the effect, and the rest of the
man&rsquo;s armor was also worked with paint and gold. Overlapping plates
in black and red outlined with gold covered his chest and ran down
the outsides of his arms and the fronts of his thighs. Even the
steel backs of his gauntlets were red and gold. Where he did not
wear metal, his clothes were dark leather. The two-handed sword on
his back, with its curved blade, was scabbarded and hilted in
black-and-red leather.</p>

<p>Then the armored figure removed his helmet, and Domon
stared. He was a woman. Her dark hair was cut short, and her face
was hard, but there was no mistaking it. He had never heard of such
a thing, except among the Aiel, and Aiel were well known to be
crazed. Just as disconcerting was the fact that her face did not
look as different as he had expected of a Seanchan. Her eyes were
blue, it was true, and her skin exceedingly fair, but he had seen
both before. If this woman wore a dress, no one would look at her
twice. He eyed her and revised his opinion, that cold stare and
those hard cheeks would make her remarked anywhere.</p>

<p>The other soldiers followed the woman onto the deck.
Domon was relieved to see, when some of them removed their strange
helmets, that they, at least, were men; men with black eyes, or
brown, who could have gone unnoticed in Tanchico or Illian. He had
begun to have visions of armies of blue-eyed women with swords.
<em>Aes Sedai with swords</em>, he thought, remembering the sea
erupting.</p>

<p>The Seanchan woman surveyed the ship arrogantly, then
picked Domon out as captain&mdash;it had to be him or Yarin, by
their clothes; the way Yarin had his eyes closed and was muttering
prayers under his breath pointed to Domon&mdash;and fixed him with
a stare like a spike.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are there any women among your crew or passengers?&rdquo;
She spoke with a soft slurring that made her hard to understand,
but there was a snap in her voice that said she was used to getting
answers. &ldquo;Speak up, man, if you are the captain. If not, wake that
other fool and tell him to speak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do be captain, my Lady,&rdquo; Domon said cautiously. He
had no idea how to address her, and he did not want to put a foot
wrong. &ldquo;I have no passengers, and there be no women in my crew.&rdquo; He
thought of the girls and women who had been carried off, and, not
for the first time, wondered what these folk wanted with them.</p>

<p>The two women dressed as women were coming up from
the longboat, one drawing the other&mdash;Domon blinked&mdash;by
a leash of silvery metal as she climbed aboard. The leash went from
a bracelet worn by the first woman to a collar around the neck of
the second. He could not tell whether it was woven or jointed&mdash;it seemed somehow to be both&mdash;but it was clearly of a
piece with both bracelet and collar. The first woman gathered the
leash in coils as the other came onto the deck. The collared woman
wore plain dark gray and stood with her hands folded and her eyes
on the planks under her feet. The other had red panels bearing
forked, silver lightning bolts on the breast of her blue dress and
on the sides of her skirts, which ended short of the ankles of her
boots. Domon eyed the women uneasily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak slowly, man,&rdquo; the blue-eyed woman demanded in
her slurred speech. She came across the deck to confront him,
staring up at him and in some way seeming taller and larger than
he. &ldquo;You are even harder to understand than the rest in this
Light-forsaken land. And I make no claim to be of the Blood. Not
yet. After <em>Corenne</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I am Captain Egeanin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Domon repeated himself, trying to speak slowly, and
added, &ldquo;I do be a peaceful trader, Captain. I mean no harm to you,
and I have no part in your war.&rdquo; He could not help eyeing the two
women connected by the leash again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A peaceful trader?&rdquo; Egeanin mused. &ldquo;In that case,
you will be free to go once you have sworn fealty again.&rdquo; She
noticed his glances and turned to smile at the women with the pride
of ownership. &ldquo;You admire my <em>damane</em>? She cost me dear, but
she was worth every coin. Few but nobles own a <em>damane</em>, and
most are property of the throne. She is strong, trader. She could
have broken your ship to splinters, had I wished it so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Domon stared at the women and the silver leash. He
had connected the one wearing the lightning with the fiery
fountains in the sea, and assumed she was an Aes Sedai. Egeanin had
just set his head whirling. <em>No one could do that to</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;She is Aes Sedai?&rdquo; he said disbelievingly.</p>

<p>He never saw the casual backhand blow coming. He
staggered as her steel-backed gauntlet split his lip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That name is never spoken,&rdquo; Egeanin said with a
dangerous softness. &ldquo;There are only the <em>damane</em>, the
Leashed Ones, and now they serve in truth as well as name.&rdquo; Her
eyes made ice seem warm.</p>

<p>Domon swallowed blood and kept his hand clenched at
his sides. If he had had a sword to hand, he would not have led his
crew to slaughter against a dozen armored soldiers, but it was an
effort to make his voice humble. &ldquo;I meant no disrespect, Captain. I
know nothing of you or your ways. If I do offend, it is ignorance,
no intention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him, then said, &ldquo;You are all ignorant,
Captain, but you will pay the debt of your forefathers. This land
was ours, and it will be ours again. With the Return, it will be
ours again.&rdquo; Domon did not know what to say&mdash;<em>Surely she
can no mean that nattering about Artur Hawkwing be true?</em>&mdash;so he kept his mouth shut. &ldquo;You will sail your vessel to
Falme&rdquo;&mdash;he tried to protest, but her glare silenced him&mdash;&ldquo;where you and your ship will be examined. If you are no
more than a peaceful trader, as you claim, you will be allowed to
go your way when you have sworn the oaths.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oaths, Captain? What oaths?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To obey, to await, and to serve. Your ancestors
should have remembered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gathered her people&mdash;except for a single
man in plain armor, which marked him of low rank as much as the
depth of his bow to Captain Egeanin&mdash;and their longboat
pulled away toward the larger ship. The remaining Seanchan gave no
orders, only sat cross-legged on the deck and began sharpening his
sword while the crew put sail on and got under way. He seemed to
have no fear at being alone, and Domon would have personally thrown
overboard any crewman who raised a hand to him, for as <em>
Spray</em> made her way along the coast, the Seanchan ship
followed, out in deeper water. There was a mile between the two
vessels, but Domon knew there was no hope of escape, and he meant
to deliver the man back to Captain Egeanin as safely as if he had
been cradled in his mother&rsquo;s arms.</p>

<p>It was a long passage to Falme, and Domon finally
persuaded the Seanchan to talk, a little. A dark-eyed man in his
middle years, with an old scar above his eyes and another nicking
his chin, his name was Caban, and he had nothing but contempt for
anyone this side of the Aryth Ocean. That gave Domon a moment&rsquo;s
pause. <em>Maybe they truly do be</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>No, that do be
madness</em>. Caban&rsquo;s speech had the same slur as Egeanin&rsquo;s, but
where hers was silk sliding across iron, his was leather rasping on
rock, and mostly he wanted to talk about battles, drinking, and
women he had known. Half the time, Domon was not certain if he were
speaking of here and now, or of wherever he had come from. The man
was certainly not forthcoming about anything Domon wanted to
know.</p>

<p>Once Domon asked about the <em>damane</em>. Caban
reached up from where he sat in front of the helmsman and put the
point of his sword to Domon&rsquo;s throat. &ldquo;Watch what your tongue
touches, or you will lose it. That&rsquo;s the business of the Blood, not
your kind. Or mine.&rdquo; He grinned while he said it, and as soon as he
was done, he went back to sliding a stone along his heavy, curved
blade.</p>

<p>Domon touched the point of blood welling above his
collar and resolved not to ask that again, at least.</p>

<p>The closer the two vessels came to Falme, the more of
the tall, square-looking Seanchan ships they passed, some under
sail, but more anchored. Every one was bluff-bowed and towered, as
big as anything Domon had ever seen, even among the Sea Folk. A few
local craft, he saw, with their sharp bows and slanted sails,
darted across the green swells. The sight gave him confidence that
Egeanin had spoken the truth about letting him go free.</p>

<p>When <em>Spray</em> came up on the headland where
Falme stood, Domon gaped at the numbers of the Seanchan ships
anchored off the harbor. He tried counting them and gave up at a
hundred, less than halfway done. He had seen as many ships in one
place before&mdash;in Illian, and Tear, and even Tanchico&mdash;but those vessels had included many smaller craft. Muttering glumly
to himself, he took <em>Spray</em> into the harbor, shepherded by
her great Seanchan watchdog.</p>

<p>Falme stood on a spit of land at the very tip of
Toman Head, with nothing further west of it except the Aryth Ocean.
High cliffs ran to the harbor mouth on both sides, and atop one of
those, where every ship running into the harbor had to pass under
them, stood the towers of the Watchers Over the Waves. A cage hung
over the side of one of the towers, with a man sitting in it
despondently, legs dangling through the bars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; Domon asked.</p>

<p>Caban had finally given over sharpening his sword,
after Domon had begun to wonder if he meant to shave with it. The
Seanchan glanced up to where Domon pointed. &ldquo;Oh. That is the First
Watcher. Not the one who sat in the chair when we first came, of
course. Every time he dies, they choose another, and we put him in
the cage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; Domon demanded.</p>

<p>Caban&rsquo;s grin showed too many teeth. &ldquo;They watched for
the wrong thing, and forgot when they should have been
remembering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Domon tore his eyes away from the Seanchan. <em>
Spray</em> slid down the last real sea swell and into the quieter
waters of the harbor. <em>I do be a trader, and it is none of my
business</em>.</p>

<p>Falme rose from stone docks up the slopes of the
hollow that made the harbor. Domon could not decide whether the
dark stone houses made up a goodly sized town or a small city.
Certainly he saw no building in it to rival the smallest palace in
Illian.</p>

<p>He guided <em>Spray</em> to a place at one of the
docks, and wondered, while the crew tied the ship fast, if the
Seanchan might buy some of the fireworks in his hold. <em>None of
my business</em>.</p>

<p>To his surprise, Egeanin had herself rowed to the
dock with her <em>damane</em>. There was another woman wearing the
bracelet this time, with the red panels and forked lightning on her
dress, but the <em>damane</em> was the same sad-faced woman who
never looked up unless the other spoke to her. Egeanin had Domon
and his crew herded off the ship to sit on the dock under the eyes
of a pair of her soldiers&mdash;she seemed to think no more were
needed, and Domon was not about to argue with her&mdash;while
others searched <em>Spray</em> under her direction. The <em>
damane</em> was part of the search.</p>

<p>Down the dock, a thing appeared. Domon could think of
no other way to describe it. A hulking creature with a leathery,
gray-green hide and a beak of a mouth in a wedge-shaped head. And
three eyes. It lumbered along beside a man whose armor bore three
painted eyes, just like those of the creature. The local people,
dockmen and sailors in roughly embroidered shirts and long vests to
their knees, shied away as the pair passed, but no Seanchan gave
them a second glance. The man with the beast seemed to be directing
it with hand signals.</p>

<p>Man and creature turned in among the buildings,
leaving Domon staring and his crew muttering to themselves. The two
Seanchan guards sneered at them silently. <em>No my business</em>,
Domon reminded himself. His business was his ship.</p>

<p>The air had a familiar smell of salt water and pitch.
He shifted uneasily on the stone, hot from the sun, and wondered
what the Seanchan were searching for. What the <em>damane</em> was
searching for. Wondered what that thing had been. Gulls cried,
wheeling above the harbor. He thought of the sounds a caged man
might make. <em>It is no my business</em>.</p>

<p>Eventually Egeanin led the others back onto the dock.
The Seanchan captain had something wrapped in a piece of yellow
silk, Domon noted warily. Something small enough to carry in one
hand, but which she held carefully in both.</p>

<p>He got to his feet&mdash;slowly, for the soldiers&rsquo;
sake, though their eyes held the same contempt Caban&rsquo;s did. &ldquo;You
see, Captain? I do be only a peaceful trader. Perhaps your people
would care to buy some fireworks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, trader.&rdquo; There was an air of suppressed
excitement about her that made him uneasy, and her next words
increased the feeling. &ldquo;You will come with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She told two soldiers to come along, and one of them
gave Domon a push to get him started. It was not a rough shove;
Domon had seen farmers push a cow in the same way to make it move.
Setting his teeth, he followed Egeanin.</p>

<p>The cobblestone street climbed the slope, leaving the
smell of the harbor behind. The slate-roofed houses grew larger and
taller as the street climbed. Surprisingly for a town held by
invaders, the streets held more local people than Seanchan
soldiers, and now and again a curtained palanquin was borne past by
bare-chested men. The Falmen seemed to be going about their
business as if the Seanchan were not there. Or almost not there.
When palanquin or soldier passed, both poor folk, with only a
curling line or two worked on their dirty clothes, and the richer,
with shirts, vests, and dresses covered from shoulder to waist in
intricately embroidered patterns, bowed and remained bent until the
Seanchan were gone. They did the same for Domon and his guard.
Neither Egeanin nor her soldiers so much as glanced at them.</p>

<p>Domon realized with a sudden shock that some of the
local people they passed wore daggers at their belts, and in a few
cases swords. He was so surprised that he spoke without thinking.
&ldquo;Some of them be on your side?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egeanin frowned over her shoulder at him, obviously
puzzled. Without slowing, she looked at the people and nodded to
herself. &ldquo;You mean the swords. They are our people, now, trader;
they have sworn the oaths.&rdquo; She stopped abruptly, pointing at a
tall, heavy-shouldered man with a heavily embroidered vest and a
sword swinging on a plain leather baldric. &ldquo;You.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man halted in mid-step, one foot in the air and a
frightened look suddenly on his face. It was a hard face, but he
looked as if he wanted to run. Instead, he turned to her and bowed,
hands on knees, eyes fixed on her boots. &ldquo;How may this one serve
the captain?&rdquo; he asked in a tight voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a merchant?&rdquo; Egeanin said. &ldquo;You have sworn
the oaths?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Captain. Yes.&rdquo; He did not take his eyes from
her feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you tell the people when you take your
wagons inland?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That they must obey the Forerunners, Captain, await
the Return, and serve Those Who Come Home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do you never think to use that sword against
us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man&rsquo;s hands went white-knuckled gripping his
knees, and there was suddenly sweat in his voice. &ldquo;I have sworn the
oaths, Captain. I obey, await, and serve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see?&rdquo; Egeanin said, turning to Domon. &ldquo;There is
no reason to forbid them weapons. There must be trade, and
merchants must protect themselves from bandits. We allow the people
to come and go as they will, so long as they obey, await, and
serve. Their forefathers broke their oaths, but these have learned
better.&rdquo; She started back up the hill, and the soldiers pushed
Domon after her.</p>

<p>He looked back at the merchant. The man stayed bent
as he was till Egeanin was ten paces up the street, then he
straightened and hurried the other way, leaping down the sloping
street.</p>

<p>Egeanin and his guards did not look around, either,
when a mounted Seanchan troop passed them, climbing the street. The
soldiers rode creatures that looked almost like cats the size of
horses, but with lizards&rsquo; scales rippling bronze beneath their
saddles. Clawed feet grasped the cobblestones. A three-eyed head
turned to regard Domon as the troop climbed by; aside from
everything else, it seemed too&mdash;knowing&mdash;for
Domon&rsquo;s peace of mind. He stumbled and almost fell. All along the
street, the Falmen were pressing themselves back against the fronts
of the buildings, some closing their eyes. The Seanchan paid them
no heed.</p>

<p>Domon understood why the Seanchan could allow the
people as much freedom as they did. He wondered if he would have
had nerve enough to resist. <em>Damane</em>. Monsters. He wondered
if there was anything to stop the Seanchan from marching all the
way to the Spine of the World. <em>No my business</em>, he reminded
himself roughly, and considered whether there was any way to avoid
the Seanchan in his future trading.</p>

<p>They reached the top of the incline, where the town
gave way to hills. There was no town wall. Ahead were the inns that
served merchants who traded inland, and wagon yards and stables.
Here, the houses would have made respectable manors for the minor
lords in Illian. The largest of them had an honor guard of Seanchan
soldiers out front, and a blue-edged banner bearing a golden,
spread-winged hawk rippling above it. Egeanin surrendered her sword
and dagger before taking Domon inside. Her two soldiers remained in
the street. Domon began to sweat. He smelled a lord in this; it was
never good to do business with a lord on the lord&rsquo;s own ground.</p>

<p>In the front hall Egeanin left Domon at the door and
spoke to a servant. A local man, judging by the full sleeves of his
shirt and the spirals embroidered across his chest; Domon believed
he caught the words &ldquo;High Lord.&rdquo; The servant hurried away,
returning finally to lead them to what was surely the largest room
in the house. Every stick of furniture had been cleared out of it,
even the rugs, and the stone floor was polished to a bright gleam.
Folding screens painted with strange birds hid walls and
windows.</p>

<p>Egeanin stopped just inside the room. When Domon
tried to ask where they were and why, she silenced him with a
savage glare and a wordless growl. She did not move, but she seemed
on the point of bouncing on her toes. She held whatever it was she
had taken from his ship as if it were precious. He tried to imagine
what it could be.</p>

<p>Suddenly a gong sounded softly, and the Seanchan
woman dropped to her knees, setting the silk-wrapped something
carefully beside her. At a look from her, Domon got down as well.
Lords had strange ways, and he suspected Seanchan lords might have
stranger ones than he knew.</p>

<p>Two men appeared in the doorway at the far end of the
room. One had the left side of his scalp shaved, his remaining pale
golden hair braided and hanging down over his ear to his shoulder.
His deep yellow robe was just long enough to let the toes of yellow
slippers peek out when he walked. The other wore a blue silk robe,
brocaded with birds and long enough to trail nearly a span on the
floor behind him. His head was shaved bald, and his fingernails
were at least an inch long, those on the first two fingers of each
hand lacquered blue. Domon&rsquo;s mouth dropped open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are in the presence of the High Lord Turak,&rdquo; the
yellow-haired man intoned, &ldquo;who leads Those Who Come Before, and
succors the Return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egeanin prostrated herself with her hands at her
sides. Domon imitated her with alacrity. <em>Even the High Lords of
Tear would no demand this</em>, he thought. Out of the corner of
his eye, he saw Egeanin kissing the floor. With a grimace, he
decided there was a limit to imitation. <em>They can no see whether
I do or no anyway</em>.</p>

<p>Egeanin suddenly stood. He started to rise as well,
and made it as far as one knee before a growl in her throat and a
scandalized look on the face of the man with the braid put him back
down, face to the floor and muttering under his breath. <em>I would
no do this for the King of Illian and the Council of Nine
together</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your name is Egeanin?&rdquo; It had to be the voice of the
man in the blue robe. His slurring speech had a rhythm almost like
singing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was so named on my sword-day, High Lord,&rdquo; she
replied humbly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a fine specimen, Egeanin. Quite rare. Do you
wish a payment?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That the High Lord is pleased is payment enough. I
live to serve, High Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will mention your name to the Empress, Egeanin.
After the Return, new names will be called to the Blood. Show
yourself fit, and you may shed the name Egeanin for a higher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The High Lord honors me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. You may leave me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Domon could see nothing but her boots backing out of
the room, pausing at intervals for bows. The door closed behind
her. There was a long silence. He was watching sweat from his
forehead drip onto the floor when Turak spoke again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may rise, trader.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Domon got to his feet, and saw what Turak held in his
long-nailed fingers. The <em>cuendillar</em> disk shaped into the
ancient seal of the Aes Sedai. Remembering Egeanin&rsquo;s reaction when
he mentioned Aes Sedai, Domon began to sweat in earnest. There was
no animosity in the High Lord&rsquo;s dark eyes, only a slight curiosity,
but Domon did not trust lords.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know what this is, trader?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, High Lord.&rdquo; Domon&rsquo;s reply was as steady as a
rock; no trader lasted long who could not lie with a straight face
and an easy voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet you kept it in a secret place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do collect old things, High Lord, from times past.
There do be those who would steal such, did they lay easy to
hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turak regarded the black-and-white disk for a moment.
&ldquo;This is <em>cuendillar</em>, trader&mdash;do you know that name?&mdash;and older than you perhaps know. Come with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Domon followed the man cautiously, feeling a little
more sure of himself. With any lord of the lands he knew, if guards
were going to be summoned, they already would have been. But the
little he had seen of Seanchan told him they did not do things as
other men did. He schooled his face to stillness.</p>

<p>He was led into another room. He thought the
furniture here had to have been brought by Turak. It seemed to be
made of curves, with no straight lines at all, and the wood was
polished to bring out strange graining. There was one chair, on a
silk carpet woven in birds and flowers, and one large cabinet made
in a circle. Folding screens made new walls.</p>

<p>The man with the braid opened the doors of the
cabinet to reveal shelves holding an odd assortment of figurines,
cups, bowls, vases, fifty different things, no two alike in size or
shape. Domon&rsquo;s breath caught as Turak carefully set the disk beside
its exact twin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Cuendillar</em>,&rdquo; Turak said. &ldquo;That is what I
collect, trader. Only the Empress herself has a finer
collection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Domon&rsquo;s eyes almost popped out of his head. If
everything on those shelves was truly <em>cuendillar</em>, it was
enough to buy a kingdom, or at the least to found a great House.
Even a king might beggar himself to buy so much of it, if he even
knew where to find so much. He put on a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;High Lord, please accept this piece as a gift.&rdquo; He
did not want to let it go, but that was better than angering this
Seanchan. <em>Maybe the Darkfriends will chase him now</em>. &ldquo;I do
be but a simple trader. I want only to trade. Let me sail, and I do
promise that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turak&rsquo;s expression never changed, but the man with
the braid cut Domon off with a snapped, &ldquo;Unshaven dog! You speak of
giving the High Lord what Captain Egeanin has already given. You
bargain, as if the High Lord were a&mdash;a merchant! You will be
flayed alive over nine days, dog, and&mdash;&rdquo; The barest motion of
Turak&rsquo;s finger silenced him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot allow you to leave me, trader,&rdquo; the High
Lord said. &ldquo;In this shadowed land of oath-breakers, I find none who
can converse with a man of sensibilities. But you are a collector.
Perhaps your conversation will be interesting.&rdquo; He took the chair,
lolling back in its curves to study Domon.</p>

<p>Domon put on what he hoped was an ingratiating smile.
&ldquo;High Lord, I do be a simple trader, a simple man. I do no have the
way of talking with great Lords.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man with the braid glared at him, but Turak
seemed not to hear. From behind one of the screens, a slim, pretty
young woman appeared on quick feet to kneel beside the High Lord,
offering a lacquered tray bearing a single cup, thin and
handleless, of some steaming black liquid. Her dark, round face was
vaguely reminiscent of the Sea Folk. Turak took the cup carefully
in his long-nailed fingers, never looking at the young woman, and
inhaled the fumes. Domon took one look at the girl and pulled his
eyes away with a strangled gasp; her white silk robe was
embroidered with flowers, but so sheer he could see right through
it, and there was nothing beneath but her own slimness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The aroma of <em>kaf</em>,&rdquo; Turak said, &ldquo;is almost
as enjoyable as the flavor. Now, trader. I have learned that <em>
cuendillar</em> is even more rare here than in Seanchan. Tell me
how a simple trader came to possess a piece.&rdquo; He sipped his kaf and
waited.</p>

<p>Domon took a deep breath and set about trying to lie
his way out of Falme.</p>
