<h4><em>Glimmers of the Pattern</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">F</span>or
once, Ingtar called a halt to the day&rsquo;s march
with the sun still golden above the horizon. The toughened
Shienarans were feeling the effects of what they had seen in the
village. Ingtar had not stopped so early before, and the campsite
he chose had the look of a place that could be defended. It was a
deep hollow, almost round, and big enough to hold all the men and
horses comfortably. A sparse thicket of scrub oak and leatherleaf
covered the outer slopes. The rim itself stood more than high
enough to hide anyone in the campsite even without the trees. The
height nearly passed for a hill, in that country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All I&rsquo;m bloody saying,&rdquo; he heard Uno tell Ragan as
they dismounted, &ldquo;is that I bloody saw her, burn you. Just before
we found the goat-kissing Halfman. The same flaming woman as at the
flaming ferry. She was there, and then she bloody wasn&rsquo;t. You say
what you bloody want to, but you watch how you flaming say it, or
I&rsquo;ll bloody skin you myself, and burn the goat-kissing hide, you
sheep-gutted milk-drinker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand paused with one foot on the ground and the other
still in the stirrup. <em>The same woman? But there wasn&rsquo;t any
woman at the ferry, just some curtains blowing in the wind. And she
couldn&rsquo;t have gotten to that village ahead of us if there had
been</em>. The village&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He shied away from the thought. Even more than the
Fade nailed to the door, he wanted to forget that room, and the
flies, and the people who were there and not there. The Halfman had
been real&mdash;everybody had seen that&mdash;but the room&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Maybe I&rsquo;m finally going mad</em>. He wished Moiraine was there
to talk to. <em>Wishing for an Aes Sedai. You</em> are <em>a fool.
You&rsquo;re well out of that, now stay out. But am I out? What happened
there?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Packhorses and supplies in the middle,&rdquo; Ingtar
commanded as the lancers went about setting up camp. &ldquo;Rub the
horses down, then saddle them again in case we must move quickly.
Every man sleeps by his mount, and there&rsquo;ll be no fires tonight.
Watch changes every two hours. Uno, I want scouts out, as far as
they can ride and return before dark. I want to know what is out
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>He&rsquo;s feeling it</em>, Rand thought. <em>It isn&rsquo;t
just some Darkfriends and a few Trollocs and maybe a Fade
anymore</em>. Just some Darkfriends and a few Trollocs, and maybe a
Fade! Even a few days before there would not have been any &ldquo;just&rdquo;
about it. Even in the Borderlands, even with the Blight less than a
day&rsquo;s ride, Darkfriends and Trollocs and Myrddraal had been bad
enough for a nightmare, then. Before he had seen a Myrddraal nailed
to a door. <em>What in the Light could have done that? What</em>
not <em>in the Light?</em> Before he had walked into a room where a
family had had their supper and their laughter cut off. <em>I must
have imagined it. I must have</em>. Even in his own head he did not
sound very convincing. He had not imagined the wind on the tower
top, or the Amyrlin saying&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand?&rdquo; He jumped as Ingtar spoke at his shoulder.
&ldquo;Are you going to stay all night with one foot in the stirrup?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand put his other foot on the ground. &ldquo;Ingtar, what
happened back at that village?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trollocs took them. The same as the people at the
ferry. That is what happened. The Fade&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Ingtar shrugged and
stared down at a flat, canvas-wrapped bundle, large and square, in
his arms; he stared at it as if he saw hidden secrets he
would rather not know. &ldquo;The Trollocs took them for food. They do it
in villages and farms near the Blight, too, sometimes, if a raid
gets past the border towers in the night. Sometimes we get the
people back, and sometimes not. Sometimes we get them back and
almost wish we hadn&rsquo;t. Trollocs don&rsquo;t always kill before they start
butchering. And Halfmen like to have their&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;fun. That&rsquo;s worse
than what the Trollocs do.&rdquo; His voice was as steady as if he were
talking of every day, and perhaps he was, for a Shienaran
soldier.</p>

<p>Rand took a deep breath to steady his stomach. &ldquo;The
Fade back there didn&rsquo;t have any fun, Ingtar. What could nail a
Myrddraal to a door, alive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ingtar hesitated, shaking his head, then pushed the
big bundle at Rand. &ldquo;Here. Moiraine Sedai told me to give you this
at the first camp south of the Erinin. I don&rsquo;t know what is in it,
but she said you would need it. She said to tell you to take care
of it; your life may depend on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand took it reluctantly; his skin prickled at the
touch of the canvas. There was something soft inside. Cloth, maybe.
He held it gingerly. <em>He doesn&rsquo;t want to think about the
Myrddraal either. What happened in that room?</em> He realized
suddenly that for him, the Fade, or even that room, was preferable
to thinking about what Moiraine might have sent him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was told to tell you at the same time that if
anything happens to me, the lances will follow you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me!&rdquo; Rand gasped, forgetting the bundle and
everything else. Ingtar met his incredulous stare with a calm nod.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s crazy! I&rsquo;ve never led anything but a flock of sheep,
Ingtar. They would not follow me anyway. Besides, Moiraine can&rsquo;t
tell you who your second is. It&rsquo;s Uno.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uno and I were called to Lord Agelmar the morning we
left. Moiraine Sedai was there, but it was Lord Agelmar who told
me. You are second, Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why, Ingtar? Why?&rdquo; Moiraine&rsquo;s hand was bright
and clear in it, hers and the Amyrlin&rsquo;s, pushing him along the path
they had chosen, but he had to ask.</p>

<p>The Shienaran looked as if he did not understand it
either, but he was a soldier, used to odd commands in the endless
war along the Blight. &ldquo;I heard rumors from the women&rsquo;s apartments
that you were really a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He spread gauntleted hands. &ldquo;No
matter. I know you deny it. Just as you deny the look of your own
face. Moiraine Sedai says you&rsquo;re a shepherd, but I never saw a
shepherd with a heron-mark blade. No matter. I&rsquo;ll not claim I would
have chosen you myself, but I think you have it in you to do what
is needed. You will do your duty, if it comes to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand wanted to say it was no duty of his, but instead
he said, &ldquo;Uno knows about this. Who else, Ingtar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the lances. When we Shienarans ride, every man
knows who is next in line if the man in command falls. A chain
unbroken right down to the last man left, even if he&rsquo;s nothing but
a horseholder. That way, you see, even if he is the last man, he is
not just a straggler running and trying to stay alive. He has the
command, and duty calls him to do what must be done. If I go to the
last embrace of the mother, the duty is yours. You will find the
Horn, and you will take it where it belongs. You will.&rdquo; There was a
peculiar emphasis in Ingtar&rsquo;s last words.</p>

<p>The bundle in Rand&rsquo;s arms seemed to weigh ten stone.
<em>Light, she could be a hundred leagues off, and she still
reaches out and tugs the leash. This way, Rand. That way. You&rsquo;re
the Dragon Reborn, Rand</em>. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want the duty, Ingtar. I
will not take it. Light, I&rsquo;m just a shepherd! Why won&rsquo;t anybody
believe that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will do your duty, Rand. When the man at the top
of the chain fails, everything below him falls apart. Too much is
falling apart. Too much already. Peace favor your sword, Rand
al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ingtar, I&mdash;&rdquo; But Ingtar was walking away,
calling to see if Uno had the scouts out yet.</p>

<p>Rand stared at the bundle in his arms and licked his
lips. He was afraid he knew what was in it. He wanted to look, yet
he wanted to throw it in a fire without opening it; he thought he
might, if he could be sure it would burn without anyone seeing what
was inside, if he could be sure what was inside would burn at all.
But he could not look there, where other eyes than his might
see.</p>

<p>He glanced around the camp. The Shienarans were
unloading the pack animals, some already handing out a cold supper
of dried meat and flatbread. Mat and Perrin tended their horses,
and Loial sat on a stone reading a book, with his long-stemmed pipe
clenched between his teeth and a wisp of smoke curling above his
head. Gripping the bundle as if afraid he might drop it, Rand
sneaked into the trees.</p>

<p>He knelt in a small clearing sheltered by
thick-foliaged branches and set the bundle on the ground. For a
time he just stared at it. <em>She wouldn&rsquo;t have. She
couldn&rsquo;t</em>. A small voice answered, <em>Oh, yes, she could. She
could and would</em>. Finally he set about untying the small knots
in the cords that bound it. Neat knots, tied with a precision that
spoke loudly of Moiraine&rsquo;s own hand; no servant had done this for
her. She would not have dared let any servant see.</p>

<p>When he had the last cord unfastened, he opened out
what was folded inside with hands that felt numb, then stared at
it, his mouth full of dust. It was all of one piece, neither woven,
nor dyed, nor painted. A banner, white as snow, big enough to be
seen the length of a field of battle. And across it marched a
rippling figure like a serpent scaled in gold and crimson, but a
serpent with four scaled legs, each tipped with five golden claws,
a serpent with eyes like the sun and a golden lion&rsquo;s mane. He had
seen it once before, and Moiraine had told him what it was. The
banner of Lews Therin Telamon, Lews Therin Kinslayer, in the War of
the Shadow. The banner of the Dragon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at that! Look what he&rsquo;s got, now!&rdquo; Mat burst
into the clearing. Perrin came after him more slowly. &ldquo;First fancy
coats,&rdquo; Mat snarled, &ldquo;and now a banner! We&rsquo;ll hear no end of
lording it now, with&mdash;&rdquo; Mat got close enough to see the
banner clearly, and his jaw dropped. &ldquo;Light!&rdquo; He stumbled back a
step. &ldquo;Burn me!&rdquo; He had been there, too, when Moiraine named the
banner. So had Perrin.</p>

<p>Anger boiled up in Rand, anger at Moiraine and the
Amyrlin Seat, pushing him, pulling him. He snatched up the banner
in both hands and shook it at Mat, words boiling out
uncontrollably. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! The Dragon&rsquo;s banner!&rdquo; Mat took
another step back. &ldquo;Moiraine wants me to be a puppet on Tar Valon
strings, a false Dragon for the Aes Sedai. She&rsquo;s going to push it
down my throat whatever I want. But&mdash;I&mdash;will&mdash;not&mdash;be&mdash;used!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat had backed up against a tree trunk. &ldquo;A false
Dragon?&rdquo; He swallowed. &ldquo;You? That&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that&rsquo;s crazy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin had not retreated. He squatted down with his
thick arms on his knees and studied Rand with those bright golden
eyes. In the evening shadows they seemed to shine. &ldquo;If the Aes
Sedai want you for a false Dragon&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He paused, frowning,
thinking things through. Finally, he said quietly, &ldquo;Rand, can you
channel?&rdquo; Mat gave a strangled gasp.</p>

<p>Rand let the banner drop; he hesitated only a moment
before nodding wearily. &ldquo;I did not ask for it. I don&rsquo;t want it. But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;But I do not think I know how to stop it.&rdquo; The room with the
flies came back unbidden to his mind. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll let me
stop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn me!&rdquo; Mat breathed. &ldquo;Blood and bloody ashes!
They&rsquo;ll kill us, you know. All of us. Perrin and me as well as you.
If Ingtar and the others find out, they will cut our bloody throats
for Darkfriends. Light, they&rsquo;ll probably think we were part of
stealing the Horn, and killing those people in Fal Dara.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut up, Mat,&rdquo; Perrin said calmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me to shut up. If Ingtar doesn&rsquo;t kill us,
Rand will go mad and do it for him. Burn me! Burn me!&rdquo; Mat slid
down the tree to sit on the ground. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t they gentle you? If
the Aes Sedai know, why didn&rsquo;t they gentle you? I never heard of
them letting a man who can wield the Power just walk away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t all know,&rdquo; Rand sighed. &ldquo;The Amyrlin&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Amyrlin Seat! <em>She</em> knows? Light, no
wonder she looked at me so strange.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;and Moiraine told me I&rsquo;m the Dragon Reborn,
and then they said I could go wherever I wanted. Don&rsquo;t you see,
Mat? They are trying to use me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t change you being able to channel,&rdquo; Mat
muttered. &ldquo;If I were you, I&rsquo;d be halfway to the Aryth Ocean by now.
And I would not stop until I found someplace where there were no
Aes Sedai, and never likely to be any. And no people. I mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut up, Mat,&rdquo; Perrin said. &ldquo;Why <em>are</em> you
here, Rand? The longer you stay around people, the more likely it
is somebody will find out and send for Aes Sedai. Aes Sedai who
<em>won&rsquo;t</em> tell you to go on about your business.&rdquo; He paused,
scratching his head over that. &ldquo;And Mat&rsquo;s right about Ingtar. I
don&rsquo;t doubt he would name you Darkfriend and kill you. Kill all of
us, maybe. He seems to like you, but he&rsquo;d still do it, I think. A
false Dragon? So would the others. Masema wouldn&rsquo;t need that much
excuse, for you. So why aren&rsquo;t you gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shrugged. &ldquo;I was going, but first the Amyrlin
came, and then the Horn was stolen, and the dagger, and Moiraine
said Mat was dying, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Light, I thought I could stay with
you until we found the dagger, at least; I thought I could help
with that. Maybe I was wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You came because of the dagger?&rdquo; Mat said quietly.
He rubbed his nose and grimaced. &ldquo;I never thought of that. I never
thought you wanted to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Aaaah! Are you feeling all right? I
mean, you aren&rsquo;t going mad already, are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand dug a pebble out of the ground and threw it at
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; Mat rubbed his arm. &ldquo;I was just asking. I
mean, all those fancy clothes, and all that talk about being a
lord. Well, that isn&rsquo;t exactly right in the head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was trying to get rid of you, fool! I was afraid
I&rsquo;d go mad and hurt you.&rdquo; His eyes dropped to the banner, and his
voice lowered. &ldquo;I will, eventually, if I don&rsquo;t stop it. Light, I
don&rsquo;t know how to stop it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is what I&rsquo;m afraid of,&rdquo; Mat said, standing. &ldquo;No
offense, Rand, but I think I will just sleep as far away from you
as I can, if you don&rsquo;t mind. That&rsquo;s if you are staying. I heard
about a fellow who could channel, once. A merchant&rsquo;s guard told me.
Before the Red Ajah found him, he woke one morning, and his whole
village was smashed flat. All the houses, all the people,
everything but the bed he was sleeping in, like a mountain had
rolled over them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin said, &ldquo;In that case, Mat, you should sleep
cheek by jowl with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may be a fool, but I intend to be a live fool.&rdquo;
Mat hesitated, looking sideways at Rand. &ldquo;Look, I know you came
along to help me, and I am grateful. I really am. But you just are
not the same anymore. You understand that, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; He waited as
if he expected an answer. None came. Finally he vanished into the
trees, back toward the camp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about you?&rdquo; Rand asked.</p>

<p>Perrin shook his head, shaggy curls swinging. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know, Rand. You are the same, but then again, you aren&rsquo;t. A
man channeling; my mother used to frighten me with that, when I was
little. I just do not know.&rdquo; He stretched out his hand and touched
a corner of the banner. &ldquo;I think I would burn this, or bury it, if
I were you. Then I&rsquo;d run so far, so fast, no Aes Sedai would ever
find me. Mat was right about that.&rdquo; He stood up, squinting at the
western sky, beginning to turn red with the sinking sun. &ldquo;Time to
get back to the camp. You think on what I said, Rand. I&rsquo;d run. But
maybe you can&rsquo;t run. Think of that, too.&rdquo; His yellow eyes seemed to
look inward, and he sounded tired. &ldquo;Sometimes you can&rsquo;t run.&rdquo; Then
he was gone, too.</p>

<p>Rand knelt there, staring at the banner spread out on
the ground. &ldquo;Well, sometimes you can run,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Only,
maybe she gave me this to make me run. Maybe she has something
waiting for me, if I run. I won&rsquo;t do what she wants. I won&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll
bury it right here. But she said my life may depend on it, and Aes
Sedai never lie so you can see it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Suddenly his shoulders shook
with silent laughter. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m talking to myself. Maybe I
<em>am</em> going mad already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he returned to the camp, he carried the banner
wrapped in the canvas once more, tied with knots less neat than
Moiraine&rsquo;s had been.</p>

<p>The light had begun to fail and the shadow of the rim
covered half the hollow. The soldiers were settling in, all with
their horses by their sides, lances propped to hand. Mat and Perrin
were bedding down alongside their horses. Rand gave them a sad
look, then fetched Red, standing where he had been left with his
reins dangling, and went to the other side of the hollow, where
Hurin had joined Loial. The Ogier had given over reading and was
examining the half-buried stone on which he had been sitting,
tracing something on the stone with the long stem of his pipe.</p>

<p>Hurin stood and gave Rand something just short of a
bow. &ldquo;Hope you don&rsquo;t mind me making my bed here, Lord&mdash;uh&mdash;Rand. I was just listening to the Builder here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you are, Rand,&rdquo; Loial said. &ldquo;You know, I think
this stone was worked once. See, it&rsquo;s weathered, but it looks as if
it was a column of some kind. And there are markings, also. I can&rsquo;t
quite make them out, but they look familiar, somehow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll be able to see them better in the
morning,&rdquo; Rand said. He pulled the saddlebags from Red. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be
glad of your company, Hurin.&rdquo; <em>I&rsquo;m glad of anybody&rsquo;s company who
isn&rsquo;t afraid of me. How much longer can I have it, though?</em></p>

<p>He shifted everything into one side of the saddlebags&mdash;spare shirts and breeches and woolen stockings, sewing kit,
tinder box, tin plate and cup, a greenwood box with knife and fork
and spoon, a packet of dried meat and flatbread for emergency
rations, and all the other traveler&rsquo;s necessaries&mdash;then
stuffed the canvas-wrapped banner into the empty pocket. It bulged,
the straps barely reaching the buckles, but then, the other side
bulged now, too. It would do.</p>

<p>Loial and Hurin seemed to sense his mood, leaving him
in silence while he stripped saddle and bridle from Red, rubbed the
big bay down with tufts of grass torn from the ground, then
resaddled him. Rand refused their offer of food; he did not think
he could have stomached the best meal he had ever seen just then.
All three of them made their beds there beside the stone, a simple
matter of a blanket folded for a pillow and cloak to cover.</p>

<p>The camp was silent now, but Rand lay awake past the
fall of full dark. His mind darted back and forth. The banner.
<em>What is she trying to make me do?</em> The village. <em>What
could kill a Fade like that</em>? Worst of all, the house in the
village. <em>Did it really happen? Am I going mad already? Do I
run, or do I stay? I have to stay. I have to help Mat find the
dagger</em>.</p>

<p>An exhausted sleep finally came, and with sleep,
unbidden, the void surrounded him, flickering with an uneasy glow
that disturbed his dreams.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Padan Fain stared northward out into the night, past
the only fire in his camp, smiling a fixed smile that never touched
his eyes. He still thought of himself as Padan Fain&mdash;Padan
Fain was the core of him&mdash;but he had been changed, and he
knew it. He knew many things, now, more than any of his old masters
could suspect. He had been a Darkfriend long years before
Ba&rsquo;alzamon summoned him and set him on the track of the three young
men from Emond&rsquo;s Field, distilling what he knew of them, distilling
him, and feeding the essence back so that he could <em>feel</em>
them, <em>smell</em> where they had been, follow wherever they ran.
Especially the one. A part of him still cringed, remembering what
Ba&rsquo;alzamon had done to him, but it was a small part, hidden,
suppressed. He was changed. Following the three had led him into
Shadar Logoth. He had not wanted to go, but he had had to obey.
Then. And in Shadar Logoth&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fain drew a deep breath and fingered the ruby-hilted
dagger at his belt. That had come from Shadar Logoth, too. It was
the only weapon he carried, the only one he needed; it felt like a
part of him. He was whole within himself, now. That was all that
mattered.</p>

<p>He cast a glance to either side of his fire. The
twelve Darkfriends who were left, their once-fine clothes now
rumpled and dirty, huddled in the darkness to one side, staring not
at the fire, but at him. On the other squatted his Trollocs, twenty
in number, the all-too-human eyes in those animal-twisted men&rsquo;s
faces following his every move like mice watching a cat.</p>

<p>It had been a struggle at first, waking each morning
to find himself not completely whole, to find the Myrddraal back in
command, raging and demanding they go north, to the Blight, to
Shayol Ghul. But bit by bit those mornings of weakness grew
shorter, until&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He remembered the feel of the hammer in his
hand, driving the spikes in, and he smiled; this time it did touch
his eyes, with the joy of sweet memory.</p>

<p>Weeping from the dark caught his ear, and his smile
faded. <em>I should never have let the Trollocs take so many</em>.
An entire village to slow them down. If those few houses at the
ferry had not been deserted, perhaps&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;But Trollocs were greedy
by nature, and in the euphoria of watching the Myrddraal die, he
had not paid attention as he should.</p>

<p>He glanced at the Trollocs. Any one of them was
nearly twice as tall as he, strong enough to break him to flinders
with one hand, yet they edged back, still crouching. &ldquo;Kill them.
All. You may feed, but then make a pile of everything that remains&mdash;for our friends to find. Put the heads on top. Neatly, now.&rdquo;
He laughed, and cut it off short. &ldquo;Go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Trollocs scrambled away, drawing scythe-like
swords and raising spiked axes. In moments shrieks and bellows rose
from where the villagers were bound. Pleas for mercy and children&rsquo;s
screams were cut off by solid thuds and unpleasant squishing
noises, like melons being broken.</p>

<p>Fain turned his back on the cacophony to look at his
Darkfriends. They were his, too, body and soul. Such souls as they
had left. Every one of them was mired as deeply as he had been,
before he found his way out. Every one with nowhere to go except to
follow him. Their eyes clung to him, fearful, pleading. &ldquo;You think
they will grow hungry again before we find another village or a
farm? They may. You think I will be letting them have some more of
you? Well, perhaps one or two. There aren&rsquo;t any more horses to
spare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The others were only commoners,&rdquo; one woman managed
in an unsteady voice. Dirt streaked her face above a finely cut
dress that marked her as a merchant, and wealthy. Smears stained
the good gray cloth, and a long tear marred her skirt. &ldquo;They were
peasants. We have served&mdash;I have served&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fain cut her off, his easy tone making his words all
the harder. &ldquo;What are you, to me? Less than peasants. Herd cattle
for the Trollocs, perhaps? If you want to live, cattle, you must be
useful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman&rsquo;s face broke. She sobbed, and suddenly all
the rest were babbling, telling him how useful they were, men and
women who had had influence and position before they were called to
fulfill their oaths at Fal Dara. They spilled out the names of
important, powerful people whom they knew in the Borderlands, in
Cairhien, and other lands. They babbled of the knowledge they alone
had of this land or that, of political situations, alliances,
intrigues, all the things they could tell him if he let them serve
him. The noise of them blended with the sounds of the Trollocs&rsquo;
slaughter and fit right in.</p>

<p>Fain ignored all of it&mdash;he had no fear of
turning his back on them, not since they had seen the Fade dealt
with&mdash;and went to his prize. Kneeling, he ran his hands over
the ornate, golden chest, feeling the power locked inside. He had
to have a Trolloc carry it&mdash;he did not trust the humans
enough to load it on a horse and packsaddle; some dreams of power
might be strong enough to overcome even fear of him, but Trollocs
never dreamed of anything except killing&mdash;and he had not yet
puzzled out how to open it. But that would come. Everything would
come. Everything.</p>

<p>Unsheathing the dagger, he laid it atop the chest
before settling himself down beside the fire. That blade was a
better guard than Trolloc or human. They had all seen what happened
when he used it, once; none would come within a span of that bared
blade without his command, and then reluctantly.</p>

<p>Lying there in his blankets, he stared northward. He
could not feel al&rsquo;Thor, now; the distance between them was too
great. Or perhaps al&rsquo;Thor was doing his vanishing trick. Sometimes,
in the keep, the boy had suddenly vanished from Fain&rsquo;s senses. He
did not know how, but always al&rsquo;Thor came back, just as suddenly as
he had gone. He would come back this time, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This time you come to me, Rand al&rsquo;Thor. Before, I
followed you like a dog driven on the trail, but now you follow
me.&rdquo; His laughter was a cackle that even he knew was mad, but he
did not care. Madness was a part of him, too. &ldquo;Come to me, al&rsquo;Thor.
The dance is not even begun yet. We&rsquo;ll dance on Toman Head, and
I&rsquo;ll be free of you. I&rsquo;ll see you dead at last.&rdquo;</p>
