<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">E</span>gwene
hurried after Nynaeve toward the knot of Aes
Sedai around the Amyrlin Seat&rsquo;s horse-borne palanquin, her desire
to know what had caused the turmoil in Fal Dara keep outweighing
even her worry over Rand. He was beyond her reach, for the moment.
Bela, her shaggy mare, was with the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s horses, and
Nynaeve&rsquo;s mount, too.</p>

<p>The Warders, hands on sword hilts and eyes searching
everywhere, made a steel circle around the Aes Sedai and the
palanquin. They were an island of relative calm in the courtyard,
where Shienaran soldiers still ran amid the keep&rsquo;s horrified
inhabitants. Egwene pushed in beside Nynaeve&mdash;the two of them
all but ignored after a single sharp glance from the Warders; all
knew they would be leaving with the Amyrlin&mdash;and caught
enough in the crowd&rsquo;s murmurs to learn of an arrow that had flashed
seemingly from nowhere and a bowman yet uncaught.</p>

<p>Egwene stopped, wide-eyed, too shocked even to think
that she was surrounded by Aes Sedai. An attempt on the life of the
Amyrlin Seat. It went beyond thinking of.</p>

<p>The Amyrlin sat in her palanquin with the curtains
drawn back, the bloodstained rip in her sleeve drawing all eyes,
and faced down Lord Agelmar. &ldquo;You will find the bowman or you will
not, my son. Either way, my business in Tar Valon is as urgent as
that of Ingtar on his quest. I leave now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Mother,&rdquo; Agelmar protested, &ldquo;this attempt on
your life changes everything. We still do not know who sent the
man, or why. An hour more, and I will have the bowman and the
answers for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin barked a laugh with no amusement in it.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need slyer bait or finer nets to catch this fish, my son.
By the time you have the man, it will be too late in the day for
leaving. There are too many who would cheer to see me dead for me
to worry overmuch about this one. You may send me news of what you
find, if you find anything at all.&rdquo; Her eyes traveled around the
towers overlooking the courtyard, and the ramparts and archers&rsquo;
balconies, still jammed with people, though silent now. The arrow
had to have come from one of those places. &ldquo;I think this bowman is
already fled from Fal Dara.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Mother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman in the palanquin cut him off with a sharp
gesture of finality. Not even the Lord of Fal Dara could press the
Amyrlin Seat too far. Her eyes came to rest on Egwene and Nynaeve,
piercing eyes that seemed to Egwene to be seeing everything about
herself that she wanted to keep secret. Egwene took a step back,
then caught herself and dropped a curtsy, wondering if that were
proper; no one had ever explained to her the protocol of meeting
the Amyrlin Seat. Nynaeve kept her back straight and returned the
Amyrlin&rsquo;s stare, but she fumbled for Egwene&rsquo;s hand and gripped as
hard as Egwene did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So these are your two, Moiraine,&rdquo; the Amyrlin said.
Moiraine gave the barest nod, and the other Aes Sedai turned to
stare at the two women from Emond&rsquo;s Field. Egwene swallowed. They
all looked as if they <em>knew</em> things, things other people did
not, and it was no help at all to know that they truly did. &ldquo;Yes, I
sense a fine spark in each of them. But what will kindle from it?
That&rsquo;s the question, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene&rsquo;s mouth felt dry as dust. She had seen Master
Padwhin, the carpenter back home, look at his tools much the same
way as the Amyrlin was looking at the two of them. This one for
this purpose, that one for that.</p>

<p>The Amyrlin said abruptly, &ldquo;It is time we were gone.
To horse. Lord Agelmar and I can say what needs be said without you
all gawking like novices on a freeday. To horse!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At her command the Warders scattered to their mounts,
still wary, and the Aes Sedai, all but Leane, glided away from the
palanquin to their own horses. As Egwene and Nynaeve turned to
obey, a servant appeared at Lord Agelmar&rsquo;s shoulder with a silver
chalice. Agelmar took it with a dissatisfied twist to his
mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With this cup from my hand, Mother, take my wish
that you fare well on this day, and every&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whatever else they said was lost to Egwene as she
scrambled onto Bela. By the time she had given the shaggy mare a
pat, and arranged her skirts, the palanquin was already moving
toward the open gates, its horses stepping without rein or lead.
Leane rode beside the palanquin, her staff propped at her stirrup.
Egwene and Nynaeve brought their horses along behind with the rest
of the Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>Roars and cheers from the crowds lining the town
streets greeted the procession, all but drowning the thunder of the
drummers and the blare of the trumpeters. Warders led the column,
with the banner bearing the White Flame waving in ripples, and rode
guard around the Aes Sedai, keeping the mass of people back;
archers and pikemen, the Flame blazoned on their chests, followed
behind in precise ranks. The trumpets fell silent as the column
wound its way out of the town and turned southward, yet the sounds
of cheering from within the town followed still. Egwene glanced
back often, until trees and hills hid Fal Dara&rsquo;s walls and
towers.</p>

<p>Nynaeve, riding alongside, shook her head. &ldquo;Rand will
be all right. He has Lord Ingtar and twenty lances with him. In any
case, there is nothing you can do about it. Nothing either of us
can do.&rdquo; She glanced toward Moiraine; the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s trim white
mare and Lan&rsquo;s tall black stallion made an odd pair off to one side
by themselves. &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The column angled westward as it traveled, and it did
not cover the ground quickly. Even footmen in half armor could not
move fast through the Shienaran hills, not and maintain the pace
for long. Still, they pushed as hard as they could.</p>

<p>Camps came late each night, the Amyrlin allowing no
stop until barely enough light remained to pitch the tents,
flattened white domes just tall enough to stand in. Each pair of
Aes Sedai from the same Ajah had one, while the Amyrlin and the
Keeper had tents to themselves. Moiraine shared the tent of her two
sisters of the Blue. The soldiers slept on the ground in their own
encampment, and the Warders wrapped themselves in their cloaks near
the tents of the Aes Sedai to whom they were bonded. The tent
shared by the Red sisters looked oddly lonely without any Warders,
while that of the Greens seemed almost festive, the two Aes Sedai
often sitting outside long past dark to talk with the four Warders
they had brought between them.</p>

<p>Lan came once to the tent Egwene shared with Nynaeve,
taking the Wisdom into the night a little distance away. Egwene
peered around the tent flap to watch. She could not hear what they
said, except that Nynaeve eventually erupted in anger and came
stalking back to wrap herself in her blankets and refuse to talk at
all. Egwene thought her cheeks were wet, though she hid her face
with a corner of her blanket. Lan stood watching the tent from the
darkness for a long time before he went away. After that he did not
come again.</p>

<p>Moiraine did not come near them, giving them only a
nod in passing. She seemed to spend her waking hours speaking with
the other Aes Sedai, all but the Red sisters, drawing them aside
one by one as they rode. The Amyrlin allowed few stops for rest,
and those short.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe she doesn&rsquo;t have time for us anymore,&rdquo; Egwene
observed sadly. Moiraine was the one Aes Sedai she knew. Perhaps&mdash;though she did not like to admit it&mdash;the only one she
was sure she could trust. &ldquo;She found us, and we are on our way to
Tar Valon. I suppose she has other things to concern her, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve snorted softly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll believe she is done
with us when she&rsquo;s dead&mdash;or we are. She is sly, that
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Other Aes Sedai came to their tent. Egwene almost
jumped out of her skin that first night out of Fal Dara, when the
tent flap was pushed aside and a plump, square-faced Aes Sedai,
with graying hair and a vaguely distracted look in her dark eyes,
ducked into their tent. She glanced at the lantern hanging at the
highest point of the tent, and the flame rose a little higher.
Egwene thought she felt something, thought she almost saw something
about the Aes Sedai when the flame grew brighter. Moiraine had told
her that one day&mdash;when she had more training&mdash;she would
be able to <em>see</em> when another woman channeled, and to tell a
woman who could channel even if she did nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Verin Mathwin,&rdquo; the woman said with a smile.
&ldquo;And you are Egwene al&rsquo;Vere and Nynaeve al&rsquo;Maera. From the Two
Rivers, which was once Manetheren. Strong blood, that. It
sings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene exchanged glances with Nynaeve as they got to
their feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this a summons to the Amyrlin Seat?&rdquo; Egwene
asked.</p>

<p>Verin laughed. The Aes Sedai had a smudge of ink on
her nose. &ldquo;Oh, my, no. The Amyrlin has more important things to
deal with than two young women who are not even novices yet.
Although, you never can tell. You both have considerable potential,
especially you, Nynaeve. One day&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She paused, rubbing a
finger thoughtfully right atop the ink smudge. &ldquo;But this is not one
day. I am here to give you a lesson, Egwene. You have been poking
in ahead of yourself, I fear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nervously, Egwene looked at Nynaeve. &ldquo;What have I
done? Nothing that I&rsquo;m aware of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing wrong. Not exactly. Somewhat dangerous,
perhaps, but not exactly wrong.&rdquo; Verin lowered herself to the
canvas floor, folding her legs under her. &ldquo;Sit, both of you. Sit. I
don&rsquo;t mean to crane my neck.&rdquo; She shifted around until she had a
comfortable position. &ldquo;Sit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene settled cross-legged across from the Aes Sedai
and did her best not to look at Nynaeve. <em>No need to look guilty
until I know if I am. And maybe not then</em>. &ldquo;What is it I&rsquo;ve
done that&rsquo;s dangerous but not exactly wrong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;ve been channeling the Power, child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene could only gape. Nynaeve burst out, &ldquo;That is
ridiculous. Why are we going to Tar Valon, if not for that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moiraine has&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I mean, Moiraine Sedai has been
giving me lessons,&rdquo; Egwene managed.</p>

<p>Verin held up her hands for quiet, and they fell
silent. She might seem vague, but she was Aes Sedai, after all.
&ldquo;Child, do you think Aes Sedai immediately teach every girl who
says she wants to be one of us how to channel? Well, I suppose you
are not exactly every girl, but just the same&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She shook her
head gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why did she?&rdquo; Nynaeve demanded. There had been
no lessons for her, and Egwene was still not sure if it rankled
Nynaeve or not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because Egwene had already channeled,&rdquo; Verin said
patiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;So have I.&rdquo; Nynaeve did not sound happy
about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your circumstances are different, child. That you
are still alive shows you weathered the various crises, and did it
on your own. I think you know how lucky you are. Of every four
women forced to do what you did, only one survives. Of course,
wilders&mdash;&rdquo; Verin grimaced. &ldquo;Forgive me, but I am afraid that
<em>is</em> what we in the White Tower often call women who, without any
training, have managed some rough control&mdash;random, and barely
enough to be called control, usually, like you, but still control
of a sort. Wilders have difficulties, it is true. Almost always
they have built up walls to keep themselves from knowing what it
was they were doing, and those walls interfere with conscious
control. The longer those walls have to build, the harder it is to
tear them down, but if they can be demolished&mdash;well, some of
the most adept sisters ever have been wilders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve shifted irritably, and looked at the entrance
as if thinking of leaving.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what any of that has to do with me,&rdquo;
Egwene said.</p>

<p>Verin blinked at her, almost as if wondering where
she had come from. &ldquo;With you? Why, nothing. Your problem is quite
different. Most girls who want to become Aes Sedai&mdash;even most
girls with the seed inside them, like you&mdash;are afraid of it,
too. Even after they reach the Tower, even after they&rsquo;ve learned
what to do and how, for months they need to be led, step by step,
by a sister, or by one of the Accepted. But not you. From what
Moiraine tells me, you leaped into it as soon as you knew you
could, fumbling your way through the dark with never a thought of
whether there was a bottomless pit under your next step. Oh, there
have been others like you; you are not unique. Moiraine was one
herself. Once she knew what you had done, there was nothing for it
but for her to begin teaching you. Did Moiraine never explain any
of this to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo; Egwene wished her voice was not so
breathless. &ldquo;She had&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;other matters to deal with.&rdquo; Nynaeve
snorted softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Moiraine has never believed in telling anyone
anything they did not need to know. Knowing serves no real purpose,
but then, neither does not knowing. Myself, I always prefer knowing
to not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there one? A pit, I mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Obviously not so far,&rdquo; Verin said, tilting her head.
&ldquo;But the next step?&rdquo; She shrugged. &ldquo;You see, child, the more you
<em>try</em> to touch the True Source, the more you <em>try</em> to
channel the One Power, the easier it becomes to actually do it.
Yes, in the beginning, you stretch out to the Source and more often
than not it is like grasping at air. Or you actually to channel
<em>saidar</em>, but even when you feel the One Power flowing
through you, you find you can do nothing with it. Or you do
something, and it isn&rsquo;t what you intended at all. That is the
danger. Usually, with guidance and training&mdash;and the girl&rsquo;s
own fear slowing her down&mdash;the ability to touch the Source
and the ability to channel the Power come together with the ability
to control what she is doing. But you began trying to channel
without anyone there to teach you any control at all of what you
do. I know you don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re very far along, and you are not,
but you are like someone who has taught herself to run up hills&mdash;sometimes, at least&mdash;without ever learning how to run
down the other side, or to walk. Sooner or later you are going to
fall, if you don&rsquo;t learn the rest of it. Now, I am not talking
about anything like what happens when one of those poor men begins
channeling&mdash;you will not go mad; you won&rsquo;t die, not with
sisters to teach and guide you&mdash;but what might you do
entirely by accident, never meaning to?&rdquo; For an instant the
vagueness had dropped from Verin&rsquo;s eyes. For an instant, it seemed,
the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s gaze had flicked from Egwene to Nynaeve as sharply
as the Amyrlin&rsquo;s had. &ldquo;Your innate abilities are strong, child, and
they will grow stronger. You must learn to control them before you
harm yourself, or someone else, or a great many people. That is
what Moiraine was trying to teach you. That is what I will try to
help you with tonight, and what a sister will help you with every
night until we put you into Sheriam&rsquo;s most capable hands. She is
Mistress of Novices.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene thought, <em>Can she know about Rand? It isn&rsquo;t
possible. She&rsquo;d never have let him leave Fal Dara if she even
suspected</em>. But she was sure she had not imagined what she saw.
&ldquo;Thank you, Verin Sedai. I will try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve rose smoothly to her feet. &ldquo;I will go sit by
the fire and leave you two alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should stay,&rdquo; Verin said. &ldquo;You could profit by
it. From what Moiraine has told me, it should take only a little
training for you to be raised to the Accepted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve hesitated only a moment before shaking her
head firmly. &ldquo;I thank you for the offer, but I can wait until we
reach Tar Valon. Egwene, if you need me, I will be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By any gauge,&rdquo; Verin cut in, &ldquo;you are a woman grown,
Nynaeve. Usually, the younger a novice, the better she does. Not
with the training necessarily, but because a novice is expected to
do as she is told, when she is told and without question. It is
really only of use once the actual training has reached a certain
point&mdash;a hesitation in the wrong place then, or a doubt of
what you have been told to do, can have tragic consequences&mdash;but it is better to follow the discipline all the time. The
Accepted, on the other hand, are expected to question things, as it
is felt they know enough to know what questions to ask and when.
Which do you think you would prefer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s hands tightened on her skirt, and she
looked at the tent flap again, frowning. Finally she gave a short
nod and settled back down on the floor. &ldquo;I suppose I might as
well,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Verin said. &ldquo;Now. You already know this part,
Egwene, but for Nynaeve&rsquo;s sake I will take you through it step by
step. In time, it will become second nature&mdash;you will do it
all faster than you can think of it&mdash;but now it is best to go
slowly. Close your eyes, please. It goes better in the beginning if
you have no distractions at all.&rdquo; Egwene closed her eyes. There was
a pause. &ldquo;Nynaeve,&rdquo; Verin said, &ldquo;please close your eyes. It will
really go better.&rdquo; Another pause. &ldquo;Thank you, child. Now, you must
empty yourself. Empty your thoughts. There is only one thing in
your mind. The bud of a flower. Only that. Only the bud. You can
see it in every detail. You can smell it. You can feel it. Every
vein of every leaf, every curve of every petal. You can feel the
sap pulsing. Feel it. Know it. Be it. You and the bud are the same.
You are one. You are the bud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her voice droned on hypnotically, but Egwene no
longer really heard; she had done this exercise before, with
Moiraine. It was slow, but Moiraine had said it would come more
quickly with practice. Inside herself, she was a rosebud, red
petals curled tightly. Yet suddenly there was something else.
Light. Light pressing on the petals. Slowly the petals unfolded,
turning toward the light, absorbing the light. The rose and the
light were one. Egwene and the light were one. She could feel the
merest trickle of it seeping through her. She stretched for more,
strained for more&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In an instant it was all gone, rose and light.
Moiraine had also said it could not be forced. With a sigh, she
opened her eyes. Nynaeve had a grim look on her face. Verin was as
calm as ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot <em>make</em> it happen,&rdquo; the Aes Sedai
was saying. &ldquo;You must <em>let</em> it happen. You must surrender to
the Power before you can control it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is complete foolishness,&rdquo; Nynaeve muttered. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t feel like a flower. If anything, I feel like a blackthorn
bush. I think I will wait by the fire after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you wish,&rdquo; Verin said. &ldquo;Did I mention that
novices do chores? They wash dishes, scrub floors, do laundry,
serve at table, all sorts of things. I myself think the servants do
a better job of it by far, but it is generally felt that such labor
builds character. Oh, you are staying? Good. Well, child, remember
that even a blackthorn bush has flowers sometimes, beautiful and
white among the thorns. We will try it one at a time. Now, from the
beginning, Egwene. Close your eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Several times before Verin left, Egwene felt the flow
of the Power through her, but it was never very strong, and the
most she managed with it was to produce a stir in the air that made
the tent flap stir slightly. She was sure a sneeze could have done
as much. She had done better with Moiraine; sometimes, at least.
She wished it was Moiraine doing the teaching.</p>

<p>Nynaeve never even felt a glimmer, or so she said. By
the end her eyes were set and her mouth so tight that Egwene was
afraid she was about to begin berating Verin as if the Aes Sedai
were a village woman intruding on her privacy. But Verin simply
told her to close her eyes once again, this time without
Egwene.</p>

<p>Egwene was sitting, watching the other two between
her yawns. The night had grown late, well past the time she would
usually be asleep. Nynaeve wore a face like week-old death, her
eyes clamped shut as if she never meant to open them and her hands
white-knuckled fists in her lap. Egwene hoped the Wisdom&rsquo;s temper
did not break loose, not after she had held it this long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Feel the flow through you,&rdquo; Verin was saying. Her
voice did not change, but suddenly there was a gleam in her eyes.
&ldquo;Feel the flow. Flow of the Power. Flow like a breeze, a gentle
stirring in the air.&rdquo; Egwene sat up straight. This was how Verin
had guided her each time she had actually had the Power flowing
through her. &ldquo;A soft breeze, the slightest movement of air.
Soft.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly the stacked blankets burst into flame like
fatwood.</p>

<p>Nynaeve opened her eyes with a yell. Egwene was not
sure if she screamed or not. All Egwene knew was that she was on
her feet, trying to kick the burning blankets outside before they
set the tent on fire. Before she managed a second kick, the flames
vanished, leaving wispy smoke rising from a charred mass and the
smell of burned wool.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Verin said. &ldquo;Well. I did not expect to have
to douse a fire. Don&rsquo;t faint on me, child. It&rsquo;s all right now. I
took care of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I was angry.&rdquo; Nynaeve spoke through
trembling lips in a bloodless face. &ldquo;I heard you talking about a
breeze, telling me what to do, and fire just popped into my head. I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t mean to burn anything. It was just a small fire, in&mdash;in my head.&rdquo; She shuddered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose it was a small fire, at that.&rdquo; Verin
barked a laugh that was gone with another look at Nynaeve&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;Are you all right, child? If you feel ill, I can&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Nynaeve
shook her head, and Verin nodded. &ldquo;Rest is what you need. Both of
you. I&rsquo;ve worked you too hard. You must rest. The Amyrlin will have
us all up and away before first light.&rdquo; Standing, she toed the
charred blankets. &ldquo;I will have some more blankets brought to you. I
hope this shows both of you how important control is. You must
learn to do what you mean to do, and nothing more. Aside from
harming someone else, if you draw more of the Power than you can
safely handle&mdash;and you cannot handle much, yet; but it will
grow&mdash;if you draw too much, you can destroy yourself. You can
die. Or you can burn yourself out, destroy what ability you have.&rdquo;
As if she had not told them they were walking a knife edge, she
added a cheerful &ldquo;Sleep well.&rdquo; With that, she was gone.</p>

<p>Egwene put her arms around Nynaeve and hugged her
tight. &ldquo;It is all right, Nynaeve. There is no need to be
frightened. Once you learn to control&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve gave a croaking laugh. &ldquo;I am not frightened.&rdquo;
She glanced sideways at the smoking blankets and twitched her eyes
away. &ldquo;It takes more than a little fire to frighten me.&rdquo; But she
did not look at the blankets again, even when a Warder came to take
them away and leave new.</p>

<p>Verin did not come again, as she had said she would
not. Indeed, as they journeyed on, south and west, day by day, as
fast as the footmen could move, Verin paid the two women from
Emond&rsquo;s Field no more mind than Moiraine did, than did any of the
Aes Sedai. They were not precisely unfriendly, the Aes Sedai, but
rather distant and aloof, as if preoccupied. Their coolness
heightened Egwene&rsquo;s unease, and brought back all the tales she had
heard as a child.</p>

<p>Her mother had always told her the tales about Aes
Sedai were a lot of fool men&rsquo;s nonsense, but neither her mother nor
any other woman in Emond&rsquo;s Field had ever met an Aes Sedai before
Moiraine came there. She herself had spent a good deal of time with
Moiraine, and Moiraine was proof to her that not all Aes Sedai were
like the tales. Cold manipulators and merciless destroyers.
Breakers of the World. She knew now that <em>those</em>, at least&mdash;the Breakers of the World&mdash;had been male Aes Sedai,
when there were such, in the Age of Legends, but it did not help a
great deal. Not all Aes Sedai were like the tales, but how many,
and which?</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai who came to the tent each night were so
mixed that they did not help at all in clearing her thoughts.
Alviarin was as cool and businesslike as a merchant come to buy
wool and tabac, surprised that Nynaeve was part of the lesson but
accepting, sharp in her criticisms but always ready to try again.
Alanna Mosvani laughed and spent as much time talking about the
world, and men, as she did teaching. Alanna showed too much
interest in Rand and Perrin and Mat for Egwene&rsquo;s comfort, though.
Especially Rand. Worst of all was Liandrin, the only one who wore
her shawl; the others had all packed them away before leaving Fal
Dara. Liandrin sat fingering her red fringe and taught little, and
reluctantly at that. She questioned Egwene and Nynaeve as if they
had been accused of a crime, and her questions were all about the
three boys. She kept it up until Nynaeve threw her out&mdash;Egwene was not sure why Nynaeve did so&mdash;and then she left
with a warning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch yourselves, my daughters. You are in your
village no longer. Now you dabble your toes where there are things
to bite you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Finally the column reached the village of Medo, on
the banks of the Mora, which ran along the border between Shienar
and Arafel and so into the River Erinin.</p>

<p>Egwene was sure it was the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s questions
about Rand that had made her start dreaming of him, that and
worrying about him, about whether he and the others had had to
follow the Horn of Valere into the Blight. The dreams were always
bad, but at first they were just the ordinary sort of nightmare. By
the night they reached Medo, the dreams had changed, though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Egwene asked diffidently, &ldquo;but
have you seen Moiraine Sedai?&rdquo; The slender Aes Sedai waved her away
and hurried on down the crowded, torch-lit village street, calling
for someone to be careful with her horse. The woman was of the
Yellow Ajah, though not wearing her shawl now; Egwene knew no more
of her than that, not even her name.</p>

<p>Medo was a small village&mdash;though Egwene was
shocked to realize that what she now thought of as a &ldquo;small
village&rdquo; was as big as Emond&rsquo;s Field&mdash;and it was overwhelmed
now with many more outsiders than there were inhabitants. Horses
and people filled the narrow streets, jostling to the docks past
villagers who knelt whenever an unseeing Aes Sedai sped by. Harsh
torchlight lit everything. The two docks jutted out into the River
Mora like stone fingers, and each hosted a pair of small,
two-masted ships. There, horses were being hoisted on board by
booms and cables and canvas cradles under their bellies. More of
the ships&mdash;high-sided and stout, with lanterns topping their
masts&mdash;crowded the moon-streaked river, already loaded or
waiting their turn. Rowboats ferried out archers and pikemen, the
raised pikes making the boats look like gigantic pricklebacks
swimming on the surface.</p>

<p>On the left-hand dock Egwene found Anaiya, watching
the loading and chivying those who were not moving fast enough.
Though she had never said more than two words to Egwene, Anaiya
seemed different from the others, more like a woman from home.
Egwene could picture her baking in her kitchen; she could not see
any of the others so. &ldquo;Anaiya Sedai, have you seen Moiraine Sedai?
I need to talk to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai looked around with an absent frown.
&ldquo;What? Oh, it&rsquo;s you, child. Moiraine is gone. And your friend,
Nynaeve, is already out on the <em>River Queen</em>. I had to
bundle her onto a boat myself, shouting that she would not go
without you. Light, what a scramble! You should be aboard,
yourself. Find a boat going out to the <em>River Queen</em>. You
two will be traveling with the Amyrlin Seat, so mind yourself once
you&rsquo;re on board. No scenes or tantrums.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which ship is Moiraine Sedai&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moiraine isn&rsquo;t on a ship, girl. She&rsquo;s gone, two days
gone, and the Amyrlin is in a taking over it.&rdquo; Anaiya grimaced and
shook her head, though most of her attention was still on the
workers. &ldquo;First Moiraine vanishes with Lan, then Liandrin right on
Moiraine&rsquo;s heels, and then Verin, none of them with so much as a
word for anyone. Verin did not even take her Warder; Tomas is
chewing nails with worry over her.&rdquo; The Aes Sedai glanced at the
sky. The waxing moon shone without the hindrance of clouds. &ldquo;We
will have to call the wind again, and the Amyrlin will not be
pleased with that, either. She says she wants us on our way to Tar
Valon within an hour, and she will brook no delays. I would not
want to be Moiraine, or Liandrin, or Verin, when she sees them
next. They&rsquo;ll wish they were novices again. Why, child, what&rsquo;s the
matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene drew a deep breath. <em>Moiraine gone? She
can&rsquo;t be! I have to tell somebody, somebody who won&rsquo;t laugh at
me</em>. She imagined Anaiya back in Emond&rsquo;s Field, listening to
her daughter&rsquo;s problems; the woman fit the picture. &ldquo;Anaiya Sedai,
Rand is in trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anaiya gave her a considering look. &ldquo;That tall boy
from your village? Missing him already, are you? Well, I shouldn&rsquo;t
be surprised if he is in trouble. Young men his age usually are.
Though it was the other one&mdash;Mat?&mdash;who had the look of
trouble. Very well, child. I don&rsquo;t mean to mock you or make light.
What kind of trouble, and how do you know? He and Lord Ingtar must
have the Horn and be back in Fal Dara by now. Or else they&rsquo;ve had
to follow it into the Blight, and there&rsquo;s nothing to do about
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re in the Blight, or
back in Fal Dara. I had a dream.&rdquo; She said it half defiantly. It
sounded silly when she said it, but it had seemed so real. A
nightmare for true, but real. First there had been a man with a
mask over his face, and fire in place of his eyes. Despite the
mask, she had thought he was surprised to see her. His look had
frightened her till she thought her bones would break from
shivering, but suddenly he vanished, and she saw Rand sleeping on
the ground, wrapped in a cloak. A woman had been standing over him,
looking down. Her face was in shadow, but her eyes seemed to shine
like the moon, and Egwene had known she was evil. Then there was a
flash of light, and they were gone. Both of them. And behind it
all, almost like another thing altogether, was the feel of danger,
as if a trap was just beginning to snap shut on an unsuspecting
lamb, a trap with many jaws. As though time had slowed, and she
could watch the iron jaws creep closer together. The dream had not
faded with waking, the way dreams did. And the danger felt so
strong she still wanted to look over her shoulder&mdash;only
somehow she knew that it was aimed at Rand, not at her.</p>

<p>She wondered if the woman had been Moiraine, and
upbraided herself for the thought. Liandrin fit that part better.
Or perhaps Alanna; she had been interested in Rand, too.</p>

<p>She could not bring herself to tell Anaiya. Formally,
she said, &ldquo;Anaiya Sedai, I know it sounds foolish, but he is in
danger. Great danger. I know it. I could feel it. I still can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anaiya wore a thoughtful look. &ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; she said
softly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a possibility I&rsquo;ll wager no one has considered. You
may be a Dreamer. It is a small chance, child, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;We haven&rsquo;t
had one of those in&mdash;oh&mdash;four or five hundred years.
And Dreaming is close linked to Foretelling. If you really can
Dream, it may be that you can Foretell, as well. <em>That</em>
would be a finger in the Reds&rsquo; eye. Of course, it could be just an
ordinary nightmare, brought on by a late night, and cold food, and
us traveling so hard since we left Fal Dara. And you missing your
young man. Much more likely. Yes, yes, child, I know. You are
worried about him. Did your dream indicate what kind of
danger?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene shook her head. &ldquo;He just vanished, and I felt
danger. And evil. I felt it even before he vanished.&rdquo; She shivered
and rubbed her hands together. &ldquo;I can still feel it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we will talk about it more on the <em>River
Queen</em>. If you <em>are</em> a Dreamer, I will see you have the
training Moiraine should be here to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;You there!&rdquo; the Aes Sedai
barked suddenly, and Egwene jumped. A tall man, who had just sat
down on a cask of wine, jumped, too. Several others quickened their
step. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s for loading aboard, not resting on! We will talk on
the boat, child. No, you fool! You can&rsquo;t carry it by yourself! Do
you want to hurt yourself?&rdquo; Anaiya went striding off down the dock,
giving the unfortunate villagers a rougher side of her tongue than
Egwene would have suspected she had.</p>

<p>Egwene peered into the dark, toward the south. He was
out there, somewhere. Not in Fal Dara, not in the Blight. She was
sure of it. <em>Hold on, you wool-headed idiot. If you get yourself
killed before I can get you out of this, I</em> will <em>skin you
alive</em>. It did not occur to her to ask how she was going to get
him out of anything, going to Tar Valon as she was.</p>

<p>Snugging her cloak around her, she set out to find a
boat to the <em>River Queen</em>.</p>
