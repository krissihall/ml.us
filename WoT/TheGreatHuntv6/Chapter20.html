kept them moving through the night, allowing
only a brief stop at dawn, to rest the horses. And to allow Loial
rest. With the Horn of Valere in its gold-and-silver chest
occupying his saddle, the Ogier walked or trotted ahead of his big
horse, never complaining, never slowing them. Sometime during the
night they had crossed the border of Cairhien.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to see it again,&rdquo; Selene said as they halted.
She dismounted and strode to Loial&rsquo;s horse. Their shadows, long and
thin, pointed west from the sun just peeking over the horizon.
&ldquo;Bring it down for me, <em>alantin</em>.&rdquo; Loial began to undo the
straps. &ldquo;The Horn of Valere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Rand said, climbing down from Red&rsquo;s back.
&ldquo;Loial, no.&rdquo; The Ogier looked from Rand to Selene, his ears
twitching doubtfully, but he took his hands away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to see the Horn,&rdquo; Selene demanded. Rand was
sure she was no older than he, but at that moment she suddenly
seemed as old and as cold as the mountains, and more regal than
Queen Morgase at her haughtiest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we should keep the dagger shielded,&rdquo; Rand
said. &ldquo;For all I know, looking at it may be as bad as touching it.
Let it stay where it is until I can put it in Mat&rsquo;s hands. He&mdash;he can take it to the Aes Sedai.&rdquo; <em>And what price will
they demand for that Healing? But he hasn&rsquo;t any choice</em>. He
felt a little guilty over feeling relief that he, at least, was
through with Aes Sedai. <em>I am done with them. One way or
another</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The dagger! All you seem to care about is that
dagger. I told you to be rid of it. The Horn of Valere, Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She came to him, a sway in her walk that made him
feel as if he had something caught in his throat. &ldquo;All I want is to
see it in the light of day. I won&rsquo;t even touch it. You hold it. It
would be something for me to remember, you holding the Horn of
Valere in your hands.&rdquo; She took his hands as she said it; her touch
made his skin tingle and his mouth go dry.</p>

<p>Something to remember&mdash;when she had gone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He could close the dagger up again as soon as the Horn was out of
the chest. It would be something to hold the Horn in his hands
where he could see it in the light.</p>

<p>He wished he knew more of the Prophecies of the
Dragon. The one time he heard a merchant&rsquo;s guard telling a part of
it, back in Emond&rsquo;s Field, Nynaeve had broken a broom across the
man&rsquo;s shoulders. None of the little he had heard mentioned the Horn
of Valere.</p>

<p><em>Aes Sedai trying to make me do what they
want</em>. Selene was still gazing intently into his eyes, her face
so young and beautiful that he wanted to kiss her despite what he
was thinking. He had never seen an Aes Sedai act the way she did,
and she looked young, not ageless. <em>A girl my age couldn&rsquo;t be
Aes Sedai. But</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Selene,&rdquo; he said softly, &ldquo;<em>are</em> you an Aes
Sedai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aes Sedai,&rdquo; she almost spat, flinging his hands
away. &ldquo;Aes Sedai! Always you hurl that at me!&rdquo; She took a deep
breath and smoothed her dress, as if gathering herself. &ldquo;I am what
and who I am. And I am no Aes Sedai!&rdquo; And she wrapped herself in a
silent coldness that made even the morning sun seem chill.</p>

<p>Loial and Hurin bore it all with as good a grace as
they could manage, trying to make conversation and hiding their
embarrassment when she froze them with a look. They rode on.</p>

<p>By the time they made camp that night beside a
mountain stream that provided fish for their supper, Selene seemed
to have regained some of her temper, chatting with the Ogier about
books, speaking kindly to Hurin.</p>

<p>She barely spoke to Rand, though, unless he spoke
first, either that evening or the following day as they rode
through mountains that reared on either side of them like huge,
jagged gray walls, ever climbing. But whenever he looked at her,
she was watching him and smiling. Sometimes it was the sort of
smile that made him smile back, sometimes the sort that made him
clear his throat and blush at his own thoughts, and sometimes the
mysterious, knowing smile that Egwene sometimes wore. It was a kind
of smile that always put his back up&mdash;but at least it was a
smile.</p>

<p><em>She</em> can&rsquo;t <em>be Aes Sedai</em>.</p>

<p>The way began to slope downwards, and with the
promise of twilight in the air, Kinslayer&rsquo;s Dagger at last gave way
to hills, rolling and round, with more brush than trees, more
thickets than forest. There was no road, just a dirt track, such as
might be used by a few carts now and again. Fields carved some of
the hills into terraces, fields full of crops but empty of people
at this hour. None of the scattered farm buildings lay close enough
to the path they rode for Rand to make out more than that they were
all made of stone.</p>

<p>When he saw the village ahead, lights already
twinkled in a few windows against the coming of night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll sleep in beds tonight,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I will enjoy, Lord Rand.&rdquo; Hurin laughed. Loial
nodded agreement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A village inn,&rdquo; Selene sniffed. &ldquo;Dirty, no doubt,
and full of unwashed men swilling ale. Why can&rsquo;t we sleep under the
stars again? I find I enjoy sleeping under the stars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would not enjoy it if Fain caught up with us
while we slept,&rdquo; Rand said, &ldquo;him and those Trollocs. He&rsquo;s coming
after me, Selene. After the Horn, too, but it is me he can find.
Why do you think I&rsquo;ve kept such a close watch these past
nights?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Fain catches us, you will deal with him.&rdquo; Her
voice was coolly confident. &ldquo;And there could be Darkfriends in the
village, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But even if they knew who we are, they can&rsquo;t do much
with the rest of the villagers around. Not unless you think
everyone in the village is a Darkfriend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if they discover you carry the Horn? Whether you
want greatness or not, even farmers dream of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is right, Rand,&rdquo; Loial said. &ldquo;I fear even
farmers might want to take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unroll your blanket, Loial, and throw it over the
chest. Keep it covered.&rdquo; Loial complied, and Rand nodded. It was
obvious there was a box or chest beneath the Ogier&rsquo;s striped
blanket, but nothing suggested it was more than a travel chest. &ldquo;My
Lady&rsquo;s chest of clothes,&rdquo; Rand said with a grin and a bow.</p>

<p>Selene met his sally with silence and an unreadable
look. After a moment, they started on again.</p>

<p>Almost immediately, off to Rand&rsquo;s left, a glitter
from the setting sun reflected from something on the ground.
Something large. Something very large, by the light it threw up.
Curious, he turned his horse that way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord?&rdquo; Hurin said. &ldquo;The village?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just want to see this first,&rdquo; Rand said. <em>It&rsquo;s
brighter than sunlight on water. What can it be?</em></p>

<p>His eyes on the reflection, he was surprised when Red
suddenly stopped. On the point of urging the bay on, he realized
that they stood on the edge of a clay precipice, above a huge
excavation. Most of the hill had been dug away to a depth of easily
a hundred paces. Certainly more than one hill had vanished, and
maybe some farmers&rsquo; fields, for the hole was at least ten times as
wide as it was deep. The far side appeared to have been packed hard
to a ramp. There were men on the bottom, a dozen of them, getting a
fire started; down there, night was already descending. Here and
there among them armor turned the light, and swords swung at their
sides. He hardly glanced at them.</p>

<p>Out of the clay at the bottom of the pit slanted a
gigantic stone hand holding a crystal sphere, and it was this that
shone with the last sunlight. Rand gaped at the size of it, a
smooth ball&mdash;he was sure not so much as a scratch marred its
surface&mdash;at least twenty paces through.</p>

<p>Some distance away from the hand, a stone face in
proportion had been uncovered. A bearded man&rsquo;s face, it thrust out
of the soil with the dignity of vast years; the broad features
seemed to hold wisdom and knowledge.</p>

<p>Unsummoned, the void formed, whole and complete in an
instant, <em>saidin</em> glowing, beckoning. So intent was he on
the face and the hand that he did not even realize what had
happened. He had once heard a ship captain speak of a giant hand
holding a huge crystal sphere; Bayle Domon had claimed it stuck out
of a hill on the island of Tremalking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is dangerous,&rdquo; Selene said. &ldquo;Come away,
Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe I can find a way down there,&rdquo; he said
absently. <em>Saidin</em> sang to him. The huge ball seemed to glow
white with the light of the sinking sun. It seemed to him that in
the depths of the crystal, light swirled and danced in time to the
song of <em>saidin</em>. He wondered why the men below did not
appear to notice.</p>

<p>Selene rode close and took hold of his arm. &ldquo;Please,
Rand, you must come away.&rdquo; He looked at her hand, puzzled, then
followed her arm up to her face. She seemed genuinely worried,
perhaps even afraid. &ldquo;If this bank doesn&rsquo;t give way beneath our
horses and break our necks with the fall, those men are guards, and
no one puts guards on something they wish every passerby to
examine. What good will it do you to avoid Fain, if some lord&rsquo;s
guards arrest you? Come away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly&mdash;a drifting, distant thought&mdash;he
realized that the void surrounded him. <em>Saidin</em> sang, and
the sphere pulsed&mdash;even without looking, he could feel it&mdash;and the thought came that if he sang the song <em>
saidin</em> sang, that huge stone face would open its mouth and
sing with him. With him and with <em>saidin</em>. All one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, Rand,&rdquo; Selene said. &ldquo;I will go to the
village with you. I won&rsquo;t mention the Horn again. Only come
away!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He released the void&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and it did not go. <em>Saidin</em> crooned, and the light in the sphere beat like a heart.
Like his heart. Loial, Hurin, Selene, they all stared at him, but
they seemed oblivious to the glorious blaze from the crystal. He
tried to push the void away. It held like granite; he floated in an
emptiness as hard as stone. The song of <em>saidin</em>, the song
of the sphere, he could feel them quivering along his bones.
Grimly, he refused to give in, reached deep inside himself&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>I will not</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand.&rdquo; He did not know whose voice it was.</p>

<p>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;reached for the core of who he was, the core of
what he was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>will not</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand.&rdquo; The song filled him, filled the emptiness</p>

<p>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;touched stone, hot from a pitiless sun, cold
from a merciless night&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Light filled him, blinded him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Till shade is gone,&rdquo; he mumbled, &ldquo;till water is gone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power filled him. He was one with the sphere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;into the Shadow with teeth bared&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The power was his. The Power was his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to spit in Sightblinder&rsquo; s eye&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power to Break the World.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;on the last day!&rdquo; It came out as a shout, and
the void was gone. Red shied at his cry; clay crumbled under the
stallion&rsquo;s hoof, spilling into the pit. The big bay went to his
knees. Rand leaned forward, gathering the reins, and Red scrambled
to safety, away from the edge.</p>

<p>They were all staring at him, he saw. Selene, Loial,
Hurin, all of them. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; <em>The void</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He
touched his forehead. The void had not gone when he released it,
and the glow of <em>saidin</em> had grown stronger, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He
could not remember anything more. <em>Saidin</em>. He felt cold.
&ldquo;Did I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;do something?&rdquo; He frowned, trying to remember. &ldquo;Did I
say something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You just sat there stiff as a statue,&rdquo; Loial said,
&ldquo;mumbling to yourself no matter what anyone said. I couldn&rsquo;t make
out what you were saying, not until you shouted &lsquo;day!&rsquo; loud enough
to wake the dead and nearly put your horse over the edge. Are you
ill? You&rsquo;re acting more and more oddly every day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sick,&rdquo; Rand said harshly, then softened it.
&ldquo;I am all right, Loial.&rdquo; Selene watched him warily.</p>

<p>From the pit came the sound of men calling, the words
indistinguishable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord Rand,&rdquo; Hurin said, &ldquo;I think those guards have
finally noticed us. If they know a way up this side, they could be
here any minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Selene said. &ldquo;Let us leave here quickly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand glanced at the excavation, then away again,
quickly. The great crystal held nothing except reflected light from
the evening sun, but he did not want to look at it. He could almost
remember&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>something</em> about the sphere. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see
any reason to wait for them. We didn&rsquo;t do anything. Let&rsquo;s find an
inn.&rdquo; He turned Red toward the village, and they soon left pit and
shouting guards behind.</p>

<p>As many villages did, Tremonsien covered the top of a
hill, but like the farms they had passed, this hill had been
sculpted into terraces with stone retaining walls. Square stone
houses sat on precise plots of land, with exact gardens behind,
along a few straight streets that crossed each other at right
angles. The necessity of a curve to streets going around the hill
seemed begrudged.</p>

<p>Yet the people seemed open and friendly enough,
pausing to nod to each other as they hurried about their last
chores before nightfall. They were a short folk&mdash;none taller
than Rand&rsquo;s shoulder, and few as tall as Hurin&mdash;with dark
eyes and pale, narrow faces, and dressed in dark clothes except for
a few who wore slashes of color across the chest. Smells of cooking&mdash;oddly spiced, to Rand&rsquo;s nose&mdash;filled the air, though a
handful of goodwives still hung over their doors to talk; the doors
were split, so the top could stand open while the bottom was
closed. The people eyed the newcomers curiously, with no sign of
hostility. A few stared a moment longer at Loial, an Ogier walking
alongside a horse as big as a Dhurran stallion, but never more than
a moment longer.</p>

<p>The inn, at the very top of the hill, was stone like
every other building in the town, and plainly marked by a painted
sign hanging over the wide doors. The Nine Rings. Rand swung down
with a smile and tied Red to one of the hitching posts out front.
&ldquo;The Nine Rings&rdquo; had been one of his favorite adventure stories
when he was a boy; he supposed it still was.</p>

<p>Selene still seemed uneasy when he helped her
dismount. &ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t frighten you
back there, did I? Red would never fall over a cliff with me.&rdquo; He
wondered what had really happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You terrified me,&rdquo; she said in a tight voice, &ldquo;and I
do not frighten easily. You could have killed yourself, killed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She smoothed her dress. &ldquo;Ride with me. Tonight. Now. Bring the
Horn, and I will stay by your side forever. Think of it. Me by your
side, and the Horn of Valere in your hands. And that will only be
the beginning, I promise. What more could you ask for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shook his head. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, Selene. The Horn&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He looked around. A man looked out his window across the way,
then twitched the curtains closed; evening darkened the street, and
there was no one else in sight now except Loial and Hurin. &ldquo;The
Horn is not mine. I told you that.&rdquo; She turned her back on him, her
white cloak walling him off as effectively as bricks.</p>
