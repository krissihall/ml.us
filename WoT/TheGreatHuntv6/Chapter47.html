<h4><em>The Grave Is No Bar to My Call</em></h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">M</span>at
and Perrin were mounted by the time Rand and
Hurin reached them. Far behind him, Rand heard Ingtar&rsquo;s voice rise.
&ldquo;The Light, and Shinowa!&rdquo; The clash of steel joined the roar of
other voices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Ingtar?&rdquo; Mat shouted. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; He
had the Horn of Valere lashed to the high pommel of his saddle as
if it were just any horn, but the dagger was in his belt, the
ruby-tipped hilt cupped protectively in a pale hand that seemed
made of nothing but bone and sinew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dying,&rdquo; Rand said harshly as he swung onto
Red&rsquo;s back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we have to help him,&rdquo; Perrin said. &ldquo;Mat can
take the Horn and the dagger on to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is doing it so we can all get away,&rdquo; Rand said.
<em>For that, too</em>. &ldquo;We will all take the Horn to Verin, and
then you can help her take it wherever she says it belongs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Perrin asked. Rand dug his heels
into the bay&rsquo;s flanks, and Red leaped away toward the hills beyond
the town.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light, and Shinowa!&rdquo; Ingtar&rsquo;s shout soared after
him, sounding triumphant, and lightning crashed across the sky in
answer.</p>

<p>Rand whipped Red with his reins, then lay against the
stallion&rsquo;s neck as the bay laid out in a dead run, mane and tail
streaming. He wished he did not feel as if he were running away
from Ingtar&rsquo;s cry, running from what he was supposed to do. <em>
Ingtar, a Darkfriend. I don&rsquo;t care. He was still my friend</em>.
The bay&rsquo;s gallop could not take him away from his own thoughts.
<em>Death is lighter than a feather, duty heavier than a mountain.
So many duties. Egwene. The Horn. Fain. Mat and his dagger. Why
can&rsquo;t there just be one at a time? I have to take care of all of
them. Oh, Light, Egwene!</em></p>

<p>He reined in so suddenly that Red slid to a halt,
sitting back on his haunches. They were in a scanty copse of
bare-branched trees atop one of the hills overlooking Falme. The
others galloped up behind him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Perrin demanded. &ldquo;We can help
Verin take the Horn where it&rsquo;s supposed to go? Where are you going
to be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s going mad already,&rdquo; Mat said. &ldquo;He
wouldn&rsquo;t want to stay with us if he was going mad. Would you,
Rand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You three take the Horn to Verin,&rdquo; Rand said.
<em>Egwene. So many threads, in so much danger. So many
duties</em>. &ldquo;You do not need me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat caressed the dagger&rsquo;s hilt. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very
well, but what about you? Burn me, you can&rsquo;t be going mad yet. You
can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Hurin gaped at them, not understanding half of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;I should never have
left.&rdquo; Somehow, that did not sound exactly right in his own ears;
it did not feel right inside his head. &ldquo;I have to go back. Now.&rdquo;
That sounded better. &ldquo;Egwene is still there, remember. With one of
those collars around her neck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; Mat said. &ldquo;I never saw her. Aaaah! If
you say she is there, then she&rsquo;s there. We&rsquo;ll all take the Horn to
Verin, and then we will all go back for her. You don&rsquo;t think I
would leave her there, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shook his head. <em>Threads. Duties</em>. He
felt as if he were about to explode like a firework. <em>Light,
what&rsquo;s happening to me?</em> &ldquo;Mat, Verin must take you and that
dagger to Tar Valon, so you can finally be free of it. You don&rsquo;t
have any time to waste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Saving Egwene isn&rsquo;t wasting time!&rdquo; But Mat&rsquo;s hand
had tightened on the dagger till it shook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t any of us going back,&rdquo; Perrin said. &ldquo;Not
yet. Look.&rdquo; He pointed back toward Falme.</p>

<p>The wagon yards and horse lots were turning black
with Seanchan soldiers, thousands of them rank on rank, with troops
of cavalry riding scaled beasts as well as armored men on horses,
colorful gonfalons marking the officers. <em>Grolm</em> dotted the
ranks, and other strange creatures, almost but not quite like
monstrous birds and lizards, and great things like nothing he could
describe, with gray, wrinkled skin and huge tusks. At intervals
along the lines stood <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> and <em>damane</em> by the
score. Rand wondered if Egwene were one of them. In the town behind
the soldiers, a rooftop still exploded now and again, and lightning
still streaked the sky. Two flying beasts, with leathery wings
twenty spans tip to tip, soared high overhead, keeping well away
from where the bright bolts danced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All that for us?&rdquo; Mat said incredulously. &ldquo;Who do
they think we are?&rdquo;</p>

<p>An answer came to Rand, but he shoved it away before
it had a chance to form completely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t going the other way either, Lord Rand,&rdquo;
Hurin said. &ldquo;Whitecloaks. Hundreds of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand wheeled his horse to look where the sniffer was
pointing. A long, white-cloaked line rippled slowly toward them
across the hills.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord Rand,&rdquo; Hurin muttered, &ldquo;if that lot lays an eye
on the Horn of Valere, we&rsquo;ll never get it close to an Aes Sedai.
We&rsquo;ll never get close to it again ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe that&rsquo;s why the Seanchan are gathering,&rdquo; Mat
said hopefully. &ldquo;Because of the Whitecloaks. Maybe it doesn&rsquo;t have
anything to do with us at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whether it does or not,&rdquo; Perrin said dryly, &ldquo;there
is going to be a battle here in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Either side could kill us,&rdquo; Hurin said, &ldquo;even if
they never see the Horn. If they do&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand could not manage to think about the Whitecloaks,
or the Seanchan. <em>I have to go back. Have to</em>. He was
staring at the Horn of Valere, he realized. They all were. The
curled, golden Horn hung at Mat&rsquo;s pommel, the focus of every
eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has to be there at the Last Battle,&rdquo; Mat said,
licking his lips. &ldquo;Nothing says it can&rsquo;t be used before then.&rdquo; He
pulled the Horn free of its lashings and looked at them anxiously.
&ldquo;Nothing says it can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one else said anything. Rand did not think he
could speak; his own thoughts were too urgent to allow room for
speech. <em>Have to go back. Have to go back</em>. The longer he
looked at the Horn, the more urgent his thoughts became. <em>Have
to. Have t</em>o.</p>

<p>Mat&rsquo;s hand shook as he raised the Horn of Valere to
his lips.</p>

<p>It was a clear note, golden as the Horn was golden.
The trees around them seemed to resonate with it, and the ground
under their feet, the sky overhead. That one long sound encompassed
everything.</p>

<p>Out of nowhere, a fog began to rise. First thin wisps
hanging in the air, then thicker billows, and thicker, until it
blanketed the land like clouds.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Geofram Bornhald stiffened in his saddle as a sound
filled the air, so sweet he wanted to laugh, so mournful he wanted
to cry. It seemed to come from every direction at once. A mist
began to rise, growing even as he watched.</p>

<p><em>The Seanchan. They are trying something. They
know we are here</em>.</p>

<p>It was too soon, the town too far, but he drew his
sword&mdash;a clatter of scabbards ran down the rank of his half
legion&mdash;and called, &ldquo;The legion will advance at a trot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fog covered everything, now, but he knew Falme
was still there, ahead. The pace of the horses picked up; he could
not see them, but he could hear.</p>

<p>Abruptly the ground ahead flew up with a roar,
showering him with dirt and pebbles. From the white blindness to
his right he heard another roar, and men and horses screamed, then
from his left, and again. Again. Thunder and screams, hidden by the
fog.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The legion will charge!&rdquo; His horse leaped forward as
he dug in his heels, and he heard the roar as the legion, as much
of it as still lived, followed.</p>

<p>Thunder and screams, wrapped in whiteness.</p>

<p>His last thought was regret. Byar would not be able
to tell his son Dain how he had died.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Rand could not see the trees around them any longer.
Mat had lowered the Horn, eyes wide with awe, but the sound of it
still rang in Rand&rsquo;s ears. The fog hid everything in rolling waves
as white as the finest bleached wool, yet Rand could see. He could
see, but it was mad. Falme floated somewhere beneath him, its
landward border black with the Seanchan ranks, lightning ripping
its streets. Falme hung over his head. There Whitecloaks charged
and died as the earth opened in fire beneath their horses&rsquo; hooves.
There men ran about the decks of tall, square ships in the harbor,
and on one ship, a familiar ship, fearful men waited. He could even
recognize the face of the captain. Bayle Domon. He clutched his
head with both hands. The trees were hidden, but he could still see
each of the others clearly. Hurin anxious. Mat muttering, fearful.
Perrin looking as if he knew this was meant to be. The fog roiled
up all around them.</p>

<p>Hurin gasped. &ldquo;Lord Rand!&rdquo; There was no need for him
to point.</p>

<p>Down the billowing fog, as if it were the side of a
mountain, rode shapes on horses. At first the dense mists hid more
than that, but slowly they came closer, and it was Rand&rsquo;s turn to
gasp. He knew them. Men, not all in armor, and women. Their clothes
and their weapons came from every Age, but he knew them all.</p>

<p>Rogosh Eagle-eye, a fatherly looking man with white
hair and eyes so sharp as to make his name merely a hint. Gaidal
Cain, a swarthy man with the hilts of his two swords sticking above
his broad shoulders. Golden-haired Birgitte, with her gleaming
silver bow and quiver bristling with silver arrows. More. He knew
their faces, knew their names. But he heard a hundred names when he
looked at each face, some so different he did not recognize them as
names at all, though he knew they were. Michael instead of Mikel.
Patrick instead of Paedrig. Oscar instead of Otarin.</p>

<p>He knew the man who rode at their head, too. Tall and
hook-nosed, with dark, deep-set eyes, his great sword Justice at
his side. Artur Hawkwing.</p>

<p>Mat gaped at them as they reined in before him and
the others. &ldquo;Is this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Is this all of you?&rdquo; They were little
more than a hundred, Rand saw, and realized that somehow he had
known that they would be. Hurin&rsquo;s mouth hung open; his eyes bulged
almost out of his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It takes more than bravery to bind a man to the
Horn.&rdquo; Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s voice was deep and carrying, a voice used
to giving commands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or a woman,&rdquo; Birgitte said sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or a woman,&rdquo; Hawkwing agreed. &ldquo;Only a few are bound
to the Wheel, spun out again and again to work the will of the
Wheel in the Pattern of the Ages. You could tell him, Lews Therin,
could you but remember when you wore flesh.&rdquo; He was looking at
Rand.</p>

<p>Rand shook his head, but he would not waste time with
denials. &ldquo;Invaders have come, men who call themselves Seanchan, who
use chained Aes Sedai in battle. They must be driven back into the
sea. And&mdash;and there is a girl. Egwene al&rsquo;Vere. A novice from
the White Tower. The Seanchan have her prisoner. You must help me
free her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To his surprise, several of the small host behind
Artur Hawkwing chuckled, and Birgitte, testing her bowstring,
laughed. &ldquo;You always choose women who cause you trouble, Lews
Therin.&rdquo; It had a fond sound, as between old friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Rand al&rsquo;Thor,&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;You have to
hurry. There isn&rsquo;t much time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time?&rdquo; Birgitte said, smiling. &ldquo;We have all of
time.&rdquo; Gaidal Cain dropped his reins and, guiding his horse with
his knees, drew a sword in either hand. All along the small band of
heroes there was an unsheathing of swords, an unlimbering of bows,
a hefting of spears and axes.</p>

<p>Justice shone like a mirror in Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s
gauntleted fist. &ldquo;I have fought by your side times beyond number,
Lews Therin, and faced you as many more. The Wheel spins us out for
its purposes, not ours, to serve the Pattern. I know you, if you do
not know yourself. We will drive these invaders out for you.&rdquo; His
warhorse pranced, and he looked around, frowning. &ldquo;Something is
wrong here. Something holds me.&rdquo; Suddenly he turned his sharp-eyed
gaze on Rand. &ldquo;You are here. Have you the banner?&rdquo; A murmur ran
through those behind him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Rand tore open the straps of his saddlebags
and pulled out the Dragon&rsquo;s banner. It filled his hands and hung
almost to his stallion&rsquo;s knees. The murmur among the heroes
rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Pattern weaves itself around our necks like
halters,&rdquo; Artur Hawkwing said. &ldquo;You are here. The banner is here.
The weave of this moment is set. We have come to the Horn, but we
must follow the banner. And the Dragon.&rdquo; Hurin made a faint sound
as if his throat had seized.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn me,&rdquo; Mat breathed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true. Burn me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin hesitated only an instant before swinging down
off his horse and striding into the mist. There came a chopping
sound, and when he returned, he carried a straight length of
sapling shorn of its branches. &ldquo;Give it to me, Rand,&rdquo; he said
gravely. &ldquo;If they need it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Give it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hastily, Rand helped him tie the banner to the pole.
When Perrin remounted, pole in hand, a current of air seemed to
ripple the pale length of the banner, so the serpentine Dragon
appeared to move, alive. The wind did not touch the heavy fog, only
the banner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You stay here,&rdquo; Rand told Hurin. &ldquo;When it&rsquo;s over&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;You will be safe, here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hurin drew his short sword, holding it as if it might
actually be of some use from horseback. &ldquo;Begging your pardon, Lord
Rand, but I think not. I don&rsquo;t understand the tenth part of what
I&rsquo;ve heard&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;or what I&rsquo;m seeing&rdquo;&mdash;his voice dropped to a
mutter before picking up again&mdash;&ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve come this far, and
I think I&rsquo;ll go the rest of the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Artur Hawkwing clapped the sniffer on the shoulder.
&ldquo;Sometimes the Wheel adds to our number, friend. Perhaps you will
find yourself among us, one day.&rdquo; Hurin sat up as if he had been
offered a crown. Hawkwing bowed formally from his saddle to Rand.
&ldquo;With your permission&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Lord Rand. Trumpeter, will you give us
music on the Horn? Fitting that the Horn of Valere should sing us
into battle. Bannerman, will you advance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat sounded the Horn again, long and high&mdash;the
mists rang with it&mdash;and Perrin heeled his horse forward. Rand
drew the heron-mark blade and rode between them.</p>

<p>He could see nothing but thick billows of white, but
somehow he could still see what he had before, too. Falme, where
someone used the Power in the streets, and the harbor, and the
Seanchan host, and the dying Whitecloaks, all of it beneath him,
all of it hanging above, all of it just as it had been. It seemed
as if no time at all had passed since the Horn was first blown, as
though time had paused while the heroes answered the call and now
resumed counting.</p>

<p>The wild cries Mat wrung from the Horn echoed in the
fog, and the drumming of hooves as the horses picked up speed. Rand
charged into the mists, wondering if he knew where he was headed.
The clouds thickened, hiding the far ends of the rank of heroes
galloping to either side of him, obscuring more and more, till he
could see only Mat and Perrin and Hurin clearly. Hurin crouched low
in his saddle, wide-eyed, urging his horse on. Mat sounding the
Horn, and laughing between. Perrin, his yellow eyes glowing, the
Dragon&rsquo;s banner streaming behind him. Then they were gone, too, and
Rand rode on alone, as it seemed.</p>

<p>In a way, he could still see them, but now it was the
way he could see Falme, and the Seanchan. He could not tell where
they were, or where he was. He tightened his grip on his sword,
peered into the mists ahead. He charged alone through the fog, and
somehow he knew that was how it was meant to be.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ba&rsquo;alzamon was before him in the mists,
throwing his arms wide.</p>

<p>Red reared wildly, hurling Rand from his saddle. Rand
clung to his sword desperately as he soared. It was not a hard
landing. In fact, he thought with a sense of wonder that it was
very much like landing on&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;nothing at all. One instant he was
sailing through the mists, and the next he was not.</p>

<p>When he climbed to his feet, his horse was gone, but
Ba&rsquo;alzamon was still there, striding toward him with a long,
black-charred staff in his hands. They were alone, only they and
the rolling fog. Behind Ba&rsquo;alzamon was shadow. The mist was not
dark behind him; this blackness excluded the white fog.</p>

<p>Rand was aware of the other things, too. Artur
Hawkwing and the other heroes meeting the Seanchan in dense fog.
Perrin, with the banner, swinging his axe more to fend off those
who tried to reach him than harm them. Mat, still blowing wild
notes on the Horn of Valere. Hurin down from his saddle, fighting
with short sword and sword-breaker in the way he knew. It seemed as
if the Seanchan numbers would overwhelm them in one rush, yet it
was the dark-armored Seanchan who fell back.</p>

<p>Rand went forward to meet Ba&rsquo;alzamon. Reluctantly, he
assumed the void, reached for the True Source, was filled with the
One Power. There was no other way. Perhaps he had no chance against
the Dark One, but whatever chance he did have lay in the Power. It
soaked into his limbs, seemed to suffuse everything about him, his
clothes, his sword. He felt as if he should be glowing like the
sun. It thrilled him; it made him want to vomit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out of my way,&rdquo; he grated. &ldquo;I am not here for
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The girl?&rdquo; Ba&rsquo;alzamon laughed. His mouth turned to
flame. His burns were all but healed, leaving only a few pink scars
that were already fading. He looked like a handsome man of middle
years. Except for his mouth, and his eyes. &ldquo;Which one, Lews Therin?
You will not have anyone to help you this time. You are mine, or
you are dead. In which case, you are mine anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Liar!&rdquo; Rand snarled. He struck at Ba&rsquo;alzamon, but
the staff of charred wood turned his blade in a shower of sparks.
&ldquo;Father of Lies!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fool! Did those other fools you summoned not tell
you who you are?&rdquo; The fires of Ba&rsquo;alzamon&rsquo;s face roared with
laughter.</p>

<p>Even floating in emptiness, Rand felt a chill. <em>
Would they have lied? I don&rsquo;t</em> want <em>to be the Dragon
Reborn</em>. He firmed his grip on his sword. Parting the Silk, but
Ba&rsquo;alzamon beat every cut aside; sparks flew as from a blacksmith&rsquo;s
forge and hammer. &ldquo;I have business in Falme, and none with you.
Never with you,&rdquo; Rand said. <em>I have to hold his attention until
they can free Egwene</em>. In that odd way, he could see the battle
rage among the fog-shrouded wagon yards and horse lots.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You pitiful wretch. You have sounded the Horn of
Valere. You are linked to it, now. Do you think the worms of the
White Tower will ever release you, now? They will put chains around
your neck so heavy you will never cut them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand was so surprised he felt it inside the void.
<em>He doesn&rsquo;t know everything. He doesn&rsquo;t know!</em> He was sure
it must show on his face. To cover it, he rushed at Ba&rsquo;alzamon.
Hummingbird Kisses the Honeyrose. The Moon on the Water. The
Swallow Rides the Air. Lightning arched between sword and staff.
Coruscating glitter showered the fog. Yet Ba&rsquo;alzamon fell back, his
eyes blazing in furious furnaces.</p>

<p>At the edge of his awareness, Rand saw the Seanchan
falling back in the streets of Falme, fighting desperately. <em>
Damane</em> tore the earth with the One Power, but it could not
harm Artur Hawkwing, nor the other heroes of the Horn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you remain a slug beneath a rock?&rdquo; Ba&rsquo;alzamon
snarled. The darkness behind him boiled and stirred. &ldquo;You kill
yourself while we stand here. The Power rages in you. It burns you.
It is killing you! I alone in all the world can teach you how to
control it. Serve me, and live. Serve me, or die!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; <em>Have to hold him long enough. Hurry,
Hawkwing. Hurry!</em> He launched himself at Ba&rsquo;alzamon again. The
Dove Takes Flight. The Falling Leaf.</p>

<p>This time it was he who was driven back. Dimly, he
saw the Seanchan fighting their way back in among the stables. He
redoubled his efforts. The Kingfisher Takes a Silverback. The
Seanchan gave way to a charge, Artur Hawkwing and Perrin side by
side in the van. Bundling Straw. Ba&rsquo;alzamon caught his blow in a
fountain like crimson fireflies, and he had to leap away before the
staff split his head; the wind of the blow ruffled his hair. The
Seanchan surged forward. Striking the Spark. Sparks flew like hail,
Ba&rsquo;alzamon jumped from his stroke, and the Seanchan were driven
back to the cobblestone streets.</p>

<p>Rand wanted to howl aloud. Suddenly he knew that the
two battles were linked. When he advanced, the heroes called by the
Horn drove the Seanchan back; when he fell back, the Seanchan rose
up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will not save you,&rdquo; Ba&rsquo;alzamon said. &ldquo;Those who
might save you will be carried far across the Aryth Ocean. If ever
you see them again, they will be collared slaves, and they will
destroy you for their new masters.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Egwene. I can&rsquo;t let them do that to her.</em></p>

<p>Ba&rsquo;alzamon&rsquo;s voice rode over his thoughts. &ldquo;You have
only one salvation, Rand al&rsquo;Thor. Lews Therin Kinslayer. I am your
only salvation. Serve me, and I will give you the world. Resist,
and I will destroy you as I have so often before. But this time I
will destroy you to your very soul, destroy you utterly and
forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>I have won again, Lews Therin</em>. The thought
was beyond the void, yet it took an effort to ignore it, not to
think of all the lives where he had heard it. He shifted his sword,
and Ba&rsquo;alzamon readied his staff.</p>

<p>For the first time Rand realized that Ba&rsquo;alzamon
acted as if the heron-mark blade could harm him. <em>Steel can&rsquo;t
hurt the Dark On</em>e. But Ba&rsquo;alzamon watched the sword warily.
Rand was one with the sword. He could feel every particle of it,
tiny bits a thousand times too small to be seen with the eye. And
he could feel the Power that suffused him running into the sword,
as well, threading through the intricate matrices wrought by Aes
Sedai during the Trolloc Wars.</p>

<p>It was another voice he heard then. Lan&rsquo;s voice. <em>
There will come a time when you want something more than you want
life</em>. Ingtar&rsquo;s voice. <em>It is every man&rsquo;s right to choose
when to Sheathe the Sword</em>. The picture formed of Egwene,
collared, living her life as a <em>damane</em>. <em>Threads of my
life in danger. Egwene. If Hawkwing gets into Falme, he can save
her</em>. Before he knew it, he had taken the first position of
Heron Wading in the Rushes, balanced on one foot, sword raised
high, open and defenseless. <em>Death is lighter than a feather,
duty heavier than a mountain</em>.</p>

<p>Ba&rsquo;alzamon stared at him. &ldquo;Why are you grinning like
an idiot, fool? Do you not know I can destroy you utterly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand felt a calmness beyond that of the void. &ldquo;I will
never serve you, Father of Lies. In a thousand lives, I never have.
I know that. I&rsquo;m sure of it. Come. It is time to die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ba&rsquo;alzamon&rsquo;s eyes widened; for an instant they were
furnaces that put sweat on Rand&rsquo;s face. The blackness behind
Ba&rsquo;alzamon boiled up around him, and his face hardened. &ldquo;Then
die, worm!&rdquo; He struck with the staff, as with a spear.</p>

<p>Rand screamed as he felt it pierce his side, burning
like a white-hot poker. The void trembled, but he held on with the
last of his strength, and drove the heron-mark blade into
Ba&rsquo;alzamon&rsquo;s heart. Ba&rsquo;alzamon screamed, and the dark behind him
screamed. The world exploded in fire.</p>
