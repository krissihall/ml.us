<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">R</span>and
darted through the common room of The Defender
of the Dragonwall and hurried upstairs, grinning at the startled
look the innkeeper had given him. Rand wanted to grin at
everything. <em>Thom&rsquo;s alive!</em></p>

<p>He flung open the door to his room and went straight
to the wardrobe.</p>

<p>Loial and Hurin put their heads in from the other
room, both in their shirtsleeves and with pipes in their teeth
trailing thin streams of smoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has something happened, Lord Rand?&rdquo; Hurin asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>Rand slung the bundle made from Thom&rsquo;s cloak on his
shoulder. &ldquo;The best thing that could, next to Ingtar coming. Thom
Merrilin&rsquo;s alive. And he&rsquo;s here, in Cairhien.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gleeman you told me about?&rdquo; Loial said. &ldquo;That is
wonderful, Rand. I would like to meet him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then come with me, if Hurin&rsquo;s willing to keep watch
awhile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be a pleasure, Lord Rand.&rdquo; Hurin took the
pipe out of his mouth. &ldquo;That lot in the common room kept trying to
pump me&mdash;without letting on what they were doing, of course&mdash;about who you are, my Lord, and why we&rsquo;re in Cairhien. I
told them we were waiting here to meet friends, but being
Cairhienin, they figured I was hiding something deeper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let them think what they want. Come on, Loial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not.&rdquo; The Ogier sighed. &ldquo;I really would
rather stay here.&rdquo; He raised a book with a thick finger marking his
place. &ldquo;I can meet Thom Merrilin some other time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Loial, you can&rsquo;t stay cooped up in here forever. We
do not even know how long we&rsquo;ll be in Cairhien. Anyway, we didn&rsquo;t
see any Ogier. And if we do, they would not be hunting for you,
would they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not hunting, precisely, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Rand, I may have
been too hasty in leaving Stedding Shangtai the way I did. When I
do go home, I may be in a great deal of trouble.&rdquo; His ears wilted.
&ldquo;Even if I wait until I&rsquo;m as old as Elder Haman. Perhaps I could
find an abandoned <em>stedding</em> to stay in until then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Elder Haman won&rsquo;t let you come back, you can live
in Emond&rsquo;s Field. It&rsquo;s a pretty place.&rdquo; <em>A beautiful
place</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure it is, Rand, but that would never work.
You see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will talk about it when it comes to that, Loial.
Now you are coming to see Thom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Ogier stood half again as tall as Rand, but Rand
pushed him into his long tunic and cloak and down the stairs. When
they came pounding through the common room, Rand winked at the
innkeeper, then laughed at his startled look. <em>Let him think I&rsquo;m
off to play his bloody Great Game. Let him think what he wants.
Thom&rsquo;s alive</em>.</p>

<p>Once through the Jangai Gate, in the east wall of the
city, everyone seemed to know The Bunch of Grapes. Rand and Loial
quickly found themselves there, on a street that was quiet for the
Foregate, with the sun halfway down the afternoon sky.</p>

<p>It was an old three-story structure, wooden and
rickety, but the common room was clean and full of people. Some men
were playing at dice in one corner, and some women at darts in
another. Half had the look of Cairhienin, slight and pale, but Rand
heard Andoran accents as well as others he did not know. All wore
the clothes of the Foregate, though, a blend of the styles of half
a dozen countries. A few looked around when he and Loial came in,
but they all turned back to what they had been doing.</p>

<p>The innkeeper was a woman with hair as white as
Thom&rsquo;s, and sharp eyes that studied Loial as well as Rand. She was
not Cairhienin, by her dark skin and her speech. &ldquo;Thom Merrilin?
Aye, he has a room. Top of the stairs, first door on the right.
Likely Dena will let you wait for him there&rdquo;&mdash;she eyed Rand&rsquo;s
red coat, with its herons on the high collar and golden brambles
embroidered up the sleeves, and his sword&mdash;&ldquo;my Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stairs creaked under Rand&rsquo;s boots, let alone
Loial&rsquo;s. Rand was not sure if the building would stand up much
longer. He found the door and knocked, wondering who Dena was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; a woman&rsquo;s voice called. &ldquo;I cannot open it
for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand opened the door hesitantly and put his head in.
A big, rumpled bed was shoved against one wall, and the rest of the
room was all but taken up by a pair of wardrobes, several
brass-bound trunks and chests, a table and two wooden chairs. The
slender woman sitting cross-legged on the bed with her skirts
tucked under her was keeping six colored balls spinning in a wheel
between her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever it is,&rdquo; she said, looking at her juggling,
&ldquo;leave it on the table. Thom will pay you when he comes back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you Dena?&rdquo; Rand asked.</p>

<p>She snatched the balls out of the air and turned to
regard him. She was only a handful of years older than he, pretty,
with fair Cairhienin skin and dark hair hanging loose to her
shoulders. &ldquo;I do not know you. This is my room, mine and Thom
Merrilin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The innkeeper said you might let us wait here for
Thom,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re Dena?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Us?&rdquo; Rand moved into the room so Loial could duck
inside, and the young woman&rsquo;s eyebrows lifted. &ldquo;So the Ogier have
come back. I am Dena. What do you want?&rdquo; She looked at Rand&rsquo;s coat
so deliberately that the failure to add &ldquo;my Lord&rdquo; had to be
purposeful, though her brows went up again at the herons on his
scabbard and sword hilt.</p>

<p>Rand hefted the bundle he carried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought Thom
back his harp and his flute. And I want to visit with him,&rdquo; he
added quickly; she seemed on the point of telling him to leave
them. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen him in a long time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She eyed the bundle. &ldquo;Thom always moans about losing
the best flute and the best harp he ever had. You would think he
was a Court-bard, the way he carries on. Very well. You can wait,
but I must practice. Thom says he will let me perform in the halls
next week.&rdquo; She rose gracefully and took one of the two chairs,
motioning Loial to sit on the bed. &ldquo;Zera would make Thom pay for
six chairs if you broke one of these, friend Ogier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand gave their names as he sat in the other chair&mdash;it creaked alarmingly under even his weight&mdash;and asked
doubtfully, &ldquo;Are you Thom&rsquo;s apprentice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dena gave a small smile. &ldquo;You might say that.&rdquo; She
had resumed her juggling, and her eyes were on the whirling
balls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never heard of a woman gleeman,&rdquo; Loial
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will be the first.&rdquo; The one big circle became two
smaller, overlapping circles. &ldquo;I will see the whole world before I
am done. Thom says once we have enough money, we will go down to
Tear.&rdquo; She switched to juggling three balls in each hand. &ldquo;And then
maybe out to the Sea Folk&rsquo;s islands. The Atha&rsquo;an Miere pay gleemen
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand eyed the room, with all the chests and trunks.
It did not look like the room of someone intending to move on soon.
There was even a flower growing in a pot on the windowsill. His
gaze fell on the single big bed, where Loial was sitting. <em>This
is my room, mine and Thom Merrilin&rsquo;s</em>. Dena gave him a
challenging look through the large wheel she had resumed. Rand&rsquo;s
face reddened.</p>

<p>He cleared his throat. &ldquo;Maybe we ought to wait
downstairs,&rdquo; he began when the door opened and Thom came in with
his cloak flapping around his ankles, patches fluttering. Cased
flute and harp hung on his back; the cases were reddish wood,
polished by handling.</p>

<p>Dena made the balls disappear inside her dress and
ran to throw her arms around Thom&rsquo;s neck, standing atiptoe to do
it. &ldquo;I missed you,&rdquo; she said, and kissed him.</p>

<p>The kiss went on for some time, so long that Rand was
beginning to wonder if he and Loial should leave, but Dena let her
heels drop to the floor with a sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know what that lack-wit Seaghan&rsquo;s done now,
girl?&rdquo; Thom said, looking down at her. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s taken on a pack of
louts who call themselves &lsquo;players.&rsquo; They walk around pretending to
<em>be</em> Rogosh Eagle-eye, and Blaes, and Gaidal Cain, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Aaagh! They hang a scrap of painted canvas behind them, supposed to
make the audience believe these fools are in Matuchin Hall, or the
high passes of the Mountains of Dhoom. I make the listener see
every banner, smell every battle, feel every emotion. I make them
believe <em>they</em> are Gaidal Cain. Seaghan will have his hall
torn down around his ears if he puts this lot on to follow me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thom, we have visitors. Loial, son of Arent son of
Halan. Oh, and a boy who calls himself Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom looked over her head at Rand, frowning. &ldquo;Leave
us for a while, Dena. Here.&rdquo; He pressed some silver coins into her
hand. &ldquo;Your knives are ready. Why don&rsquo;t you go pay Ivon for them?&rdquo;
He brushed her smooth cheek with a gnarled knuckle. &ldquo;Go on. I&rsquo;ll
make it up to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave him a dark look, but she tossed her cloak
around her shoulders, muttering, &ldquo;Ivon better have the balance
right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be a bard one day,&rdquo; Thom said with a note of
pride after she was gone. &ldquo;She listens to a tale once&mdash;once
only, mind!&mdash;and she has it right, not just the words, but
every nuance, every rhythm. She has a fine hand on the harp, and
she played the flute better the first time she picked it up than
you ever did.&rdquo; He set the wooden instrument cases atop one of the
larger trunks, then dropped into the chair she had abandoned. &ldquo;When
I passed through Caemlyn on the way here, Basel Gill told me you&rsquo;d
left in company with an Ogier. Among others.&rdquo; He bowed toward
Loial, even managing a flourish of his cloak despite the fact that
he was sitting on it. &ldquo;I am pleased to meet you, Loial, son of
Arent son of Halan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I to meet you, Thom Merrilin.&rdquo; Loial stood to
make his bow in return; when he straightened, his head almost
brushed the ceiling, and he quickly sat down again. &ldquo;The young
woman said she wants to be a gleeman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom&rsquo;s head shake was disparaging. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s no life
for a woman. Not much of a life for a man, for that. Wandering from
town to town, village to village, wondering how they&rsquo;ll try to
cheat you this time, half the time wondering where your next meal
is coming from. No, I&rsquo;ll talk her around. She&rsquo;ll be Court-bard to a
king or a queen before she&rsquo;s done. Aaaah! You didn&rsquo;t come
here to talk about Dena. My instruments, boy. You&rsquo;ve brought
them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand pushed the bundle across the table. Thom undid
it hurriedly&mdash;he blinked when he saw it was his old cloak,
all covered with colorful patches like the one he wore&mdash;and
opened the hard leather flute case, nodding at the sight of the
gold-and-silver flute nestled inside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I earned my bed and meals with that after we
parted,&rdquo; Rand said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; the gleeman replied dryly. &ldquo;I stopped at
some of the same inns, but I had to make do with juggling and a few
simple stories since you had my&mdash;You didn&rsquo;t touch the harp?&rdquo;
He pulled open the other dark leather case and took out a
gold-and-silver harp as ornate as the flute, cradling it in his
hands like a baby. &ldquo;Your clumsy sheepherder&rsquo;s fingers were never
meant for the harp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t touch it,&rdquo; Rand assured him.</p>

<p>Thom plucked two strings, wincing. &ldquo;At least you
could have kept it in tune,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>

<p>Rand leaned across the table toward him. &ldquo;Thom, you
wanted to go to Illian, to see the Great Hunt set out, and be one
of the first to make new stories about it, but you couldn&rsquo;t. What
would you say if I told you you could still be a part of it? A big
part?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial stirred uneasily. &ldquo;Rand, are you sure&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo;
Rand waved him to silence, his eyes on Thom.</p>

<p>Thom glanced at the Ogier and frowned. &ldquo;That would
depend on what part, and how. If you&rsquo;ve reason to believe one of
the Hunters is coming this way&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I suppose they could have left
Illian already, but he&rsquo;d be weeks reaching here if he rode straight
on, and why would he? Is this one of the fellows who never went to
Illian? He&rsquo;ll never make it into the stories without the blessing,
whatever he does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter if the Hunt has left Illian or
not.&rdquo; Rand heard Loial&rsquo;s breath catch. &ldquo;Thom, we have the Horn of
Valere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment there was dead silence. Thom broke it
with a great guffaw of laughter. &ldquo;You two have the Horn? A shepherd
and a beardless Ogier have the Horn of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He doubled over,
pounding his knee. &ldquo;The Horn of Valere!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we do have it,&rdquo; Loial said seriously.</p>

<p>Thom drew a deep breath. Small aftershocks of
laughter still seemed to catch him unaware. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you
found, but I can take you to ten taverns where a fellow will tell
you that he knows a man who knows the man who&rsquo;s already found the
Horn, and he will tell you how it was found, too&mdash;as long as
you buy his ale. I can take you to three men who will sell you the
Horn, and swear their souls under the Light it&rsquo;s the real one and
true. There is even a lord in the city has what he claims is the
Horn locked up inside his manor. He says it&rsquo;s a treasure handed
down in his House since the Breaking. I don&rsquo;t know if the Hunters
will ever find the Horn, but they will hunt down ten thousand lies
along the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moiraine says it&rsquo;s the Horn,&rdquo; Rand said.</p>

<p>Thom&rsquo;s mirth was cut short. &ldquo;She does, does she? I
thought you said she was not with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t, Thom. I have not seen her since I left
Fal Dara, in Shienar, and for a month before that she said no more
than two words together to me.&rdquo; He could not keep the bitterness
out of his voice. <em>And when she did talk, I wished she&rsquo;d kept on
ignoring me. I&rsquo;ll never dance to her tune again, the Light burn her
and every other Aes Sedai. No. Not Egwene. Not Nynaeve</em>. He was
conscious of Thom watching him closely. &ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t here, Thom. I do
not know where she is, and I do not care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, at least you have sense enough to keep it
secret. If you hadn&rsquo;t, it would be all over the Foregate by now,
and half a Cairhien would be lying in wait to take it away. Half
the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ve kept it secret, Thom. And I have to bring
it back to Fal Dara without Darkfriends or anyone else taking it
away. That&rsquo;s story enough for you right there, isn&rsquo;t it? I could
use a friend who knows the world. You&rsquo;ve been everywhere; you know
things I can&rsquo;t even imagine. Loial and Hurin know more than I do,
but we&rsquo;re all three floundering in deep water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurin&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? No, don&rsquo;t tell me how. I do not want
to know.&rdquo; The gleeman pushed back his chair and went to stare out
of the window. &ldquo;The Horn of Valere. That means the Last Battle is
coming. Who will notice? Did you see the people laughing in the streets out
there? Let the grain barges stop a week, and they won&rsquo;t laugh.
Galldrian will think they&rsquo;ve all become Aiel. The nobles all play
the Game of Houses, scheming to get close to the King, scheming to
gain more power than the King, scheming to pull down Galldrian and
<em>be</em> the next King. Or Queen. They will think Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don
is only a ploy in the Game.&rdquo; He turned away from the window. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t suppose you are talking about simply riding to Shienar and
handing the Horn to&mdash;who?&mdash;the King? Why Shienar? The
legends all tie the Horn to Illian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand looked at Loial. The Ogier&rsquo;s ears were sagging.
&ldquo;Shienar, because I know who to give it to, there. And there are
Trollocs and Darkfriends after us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why does that not surprise me? No. I may be an old
fool, but I will be an old fool in my own way. You take the glory,
boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thom&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a silence, broken only by the creaking of
the bed as Loial shifted. Finally, Rand said, &ldquo;Loial, would you
mind leaving Thom and me alone for a bit? Please?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial looked surprised&mdash;the tufts on his ears
went almost to points&mdash;but he nodded and rose. &ldquo;That dice
game in the common room looked interesting. Perhaps they will let
me play.&rdquo; Thom eyed Rand suspiciously as the door closed behind the
Ogier.</p>

<p>Rand hesitated. There were things he needed to know,
things he was sure Thom knew&mdash;the gleeman had once seemed to
know a great deal about a surprising number of things&mdash;but he
was not sure how to ask. &ldquo;Thom,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;are there any
books that have <em>The Karaethon Cycle</em> in them?&rdquo; Easier to
call it that than the Prophecies of the Dragon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the great libraries,&rdquo; Thom said slowly. &ldquo;Any
number of translations, and even in the Old Tongue, here and
there.&rdquo; Rand started to ask if there was any way for him to find
one, but the gleeman went on. &ldquo;The Old Tongue has music in it, but
too many even of the nobles are impatient with listening to it
these days. Nobles are all expected to know the Old Tongue, but
many only learn enough to impress people who don&rsquo;t. Translations
don&rsquo;t have the same sound, unless they&rsquo;re in High Chant, and
sometimes that changes meanings even more than most translations.
There is one verse in the Cycle&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t scan well,
translated word for word, but there&rsquo;s no meaning lost&mdash;that
goes like this.</p>

<p class="verse_quote">&ldquo;Twice and twice shall he be marked,<br>
twice to live, and twice to die.<br>
Once the heron, to set his path.<br>
Twice the heron, to name him true.<br>
Once the Dragon, for remembrance lost.<br>
Twice the Dragon, for the price he must pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He reached out and touched the herons embroidered on
Rand&rsquo;s high collar.</p>

<p>For a moment, Rand could only gape at him, and when
he could speak, his voice was unsteady. &ldquo;The sword makes five.
Hilt, scabbard, and blade.&rdquo; He turned his hand down on the table,
hiding the brand on his palm. For the first time since Selene&rsquo;s
salve had done its work, he could feel it. Not hurting, but he knew
it was there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So they do.&rdquo; Thom barked a laugh. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another
comes to mind.</p>

<p class="verse_quote">&ldquo;Twice dawns the day when his blood is shed.<br>
Once for mourning, once for birth.<br>
Red on black, the Dragon&rsquo;s blood stains the rock of Shayol Ghul.<br>
In the Pit of Doom shall his blood free men from the Shadow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shook his head, denying, but Thom seemed not to
notice. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how a day can dawn twice, but then a lot of it
doesn&rsquo;t really make much sense. The Stone of Tear will never fall
till <em>Callandor</em> is wielded by the Dragon Reborn, but the
Sword That Cannot Be Touched lies in the Heart of the Stone, so how
can he wield it first, eh? Well, be that as it may. I suspect Aes
Sedai would want to make events fit the Prophecies as closely as
they can. Dying somewhere in the Blasted Lands would be a high
price to pay for going along with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was an effort for Rand to make his voice calm, but
he did it. &ldquo;No Aes Sedai are using me for anything. I told you, the
last I saw of Moiraine was in Shienar. She said I could go where I
wanted, and I left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s no Aes Sedai with you now? None at
all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom knuckled his dangling white mustaches. He seemed
satisfied, and at the same time puzzled. &ldquo;Then why ask about the
Prophecies? Why send the Ogier out of the room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;didn&rsquo;t want to upset him. He&rsquo;s nervous
enough about the Horn. That&rsquo;s what I wanted to ask. Is the Horn
mentioned in the&mdash;the Prophecies?&rdquo; He still could not make
himself say it all the way out. &ldquo;All these false Dragons, and now
the Horn is found. Everybody thinks the Horn of Valere is supposed
to summon dead heroes to fight the Dark One in the Last Battle, and
the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the Dragon Reborn&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;is supposed to fight the Dark One
in the Last Battle. It seemed natural enough to ask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose it is. Not many know that about the Dragon
Reborn fighting the Last Battle, or if they do, they think he&rsquo;ll
fight alongside the Dark One. Not many read the Prophecies to find
out. What was that you said about the Horn? &lsquo;Supposed to&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned a few things since we parted, Thom.
They will come for whoever blows the Horn, even a Darkfriend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bushy eyebrows rose nearly to Thom&rsquo;s hairline. &ldquo;Now
that I didn&rsquo;t know. You have learned a few things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t mean I would let the White Tower use me
for a false Dragon. I don&rsquo;t want anything to do with Aes Sedai, or
false Dragons, or the Power, or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Rand bit his tongue. <em>Get
mad and you start babbling. Fool!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;For a time, boy, I thought you were the one Moiraine
wanted, and I even thought I knew why. You know, no man chooses to
channel the Power. It is something that happens to him, like a
disease. You cannot blame a man for falling sick, even if it might
kill you, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your nephew could channel, couldn&rsquo;t he? You told me
that was why you helped us, because your nephew had had trouble
with the White Tower and there was nobody to help him. There&rsquo;s only
one kind of trouble men can have with Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom studied the tabletop, pursing his lips. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
suppose there is any use in denying it. You understand, it is not
the kind of thing a man talks about, having a male relative who
could channel. Aaagh! The Red Ajah never gave Owyn a chance. They
gentled him, and then he died. He just gave up wanting to live&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He exhaled sadly.</p>

<p>Rand shivered. <em>Why didn&rsquo;t Moiraine do that to
me?</em> &ldquo;A chance, Thom? Do you mean there was some way he could
have dealt with it? Not gone mad? Not died?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Owyn held it off almost three years. He never hurt
anyone. He didn&rsquo;t use the Power unless he had to, and then only to
help his village. He&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Thom threw up his hands. &ldquo;I suppose
there was no choice. The people where he lived told me he was
acting strange that whole last year. They did not much want to talk
about it, and they nearly stoned me when they found out I was his
uncle. I suppose he was going mad. But he was my blood, boy. I
can&rsquo;t love the Aes Sedai for what they did to him, even if they had
to. If Moiraine&rsquo;s let you go, then you are well out of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Rand was silent. <em>Fool! Of course
there&rsquo;s no way to deal with it. You&rsquo;re going to go mad and die
whatever you do. But Ba&rsquo;alzamon said</em>&mdash;&ldquo;No!&rdquo; He colored
under Thom&rsquo;s scrutiny. &ldquo;I mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I am out of it, Thom. But I
still have the Horn of Valere. Think of it, Thom. The Horn of
Valere. Other gleemen might tell tales about it, but you could say
you had it in your hands.&rdquo; He realized he sounded like Selene, but
all that did was make him wonder where she was. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nobody I&rsquo;d
rather have with us than you, Thom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom frowned as if considering it, but in the end he
shook his head firmly. &ldquo;Boy, I like you well enough, but you know
as well as I do that I only helped before because there was an Aes
Sedai mixed in it. Seaghan doesn&rsquo;t try to cheat me more than I
expect, and with the King&rsquo;s Gift added in, I could never earn as
much in the villages. To my very great surprise, Dena seems to love
me, and&mdash;as much a surprise&mdash;I return the feeling. Now,
why should I leave that to go be chased by Trollocs and
Darkfriends? The Horn of Valere? Oh, it is a temptation, I&rsquo;ll
admit, but no. No, I will not get mixed up in it again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He leaned over to pick up one of the wooden
instrument cases, long and narrow. When he opened it, a flute lay
inside, plainly made but mounted with silver. He closed it again
and slid it across the table. &ldquo;You might need to earn your supper
again someday, boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might at that,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;At least we can talk.
I will be in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gleeman was shaking his head. &ldquo;A clean break is
best, boy. If you&rsquo;re always coming around, even if you never
mention it, I won&rsquo;t be able to get the Horn out of my head. And I
won&rsquo;t be tangled in it. I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">After Rand left, Thom threw his cloak on the bed and
sat with his elbows on the table. <em>The Horn of Valere. How did
that farmboy find</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He shut off that line of thought.
Think about the Horn too long, and he would find himself running
off with Rand to carry it to Shienar. <em>That</em> would <em>make
a story, carrying the Horn of Valere to the Borderlands with
Trollocs and Darkfriends pursuing</em>. Scowling, he reminded
himself of Dena. Even if she had not loved him, talent such as hers
was not to be found every day. And she did love, even if he could
not begin to imagine why.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old fool,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, an old fool,&rdquo; Zera said from the door. He gave
a start; he had been so absorbed in his thoughts that he had not
heard the door open. He had known Zera for years, off and on in his
wanderings, and she always took full advantage of the friendship to
speak her mind. &ldquo;An old fool who&rsquo;s playing the Game of Houses
again. Unless my ears are failing, that young lord has the sound of
Andor on his tongue. He&rsquo;s no Cairhienin, that&rsquo;s for certain sure.
<em>Daes Dae&rsquo;mar</em> is dangerous enough without letting an
outland lord mix you in his schemes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom blinked, then considered the way Rand had
looked. That coat had surely been fine enough for a lord. He was
growing old, letting things like that slip by him. Ruefully, he
realized he was considering whether to tell Zera the truth or let
her continue thinking as she did. <em>All it takes is to think
about the Great Game, and I start playing it</em>. &ldquo;The boy is a
shepherd, Zera, from the Two Rivers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laughed scornfully. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m the Queen of
Ghealdan. I tell you, the Game has grown dangerous in Cairhien the
last few years. Nothing like what you knew in Caemlyn. There are
murders done, now. You&rsquo;ll have your throat cut for you, if you
don&rsquo;t watch out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you, I am not in the Great Game any longer.
That&rsquo;s all twenty years in the past, near enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye.&rdquo; She did not sound as if she believed it. &ldquo;But
be that as it may, and young outland lords aside, you&rsquo;ve begun
performing at the lords&rsquo; manors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They pay well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And they&rsquo;ll pull you into their plots as soon as
they see how. They see a man, and think how to use him, as
naturally as breathing. This young lord of yours won&rsquo;t help you;
they will eat him alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave up on trying to convince her he was out of
it. &ldquo;Is that what you came up to say, Zera?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye. Forget playing the Great Game, Thom. Marry
Dena. She&rsquo;ll take you, the more fool her, bony and white-haired as
you are. Marry her, and forget this young lord and <em>Daes
Dae&rsquo;mar</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you for the advice,&rdquo; he said dryly. <em>
Marry her? Burden her with an old husband. She&rsquo;ll never be a bard
with my past hanging around her neck</em>. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind,
Zera, I want to be alone for a while. I perform for Lady Arilyn and
her guests tonight, and I need to prepare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave him a snort and a shake of her head and
banged the door shut behind her.</p>

<p>Thom drummed his fingers on the table. Coat or no
coat, Rand was still only a shepherd. If he had been more, if he
had been what Thom once suspected&mdash;a man who could channel&mdash;neither Moiraine nor any other Aes Sedai would ever have let
him walk away ungentled. Horn or no Horn, the boy was only a
shepherd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is out of it,&rdquo; he said aloud, &ldquo;and so am I.&rdquo;</p>
