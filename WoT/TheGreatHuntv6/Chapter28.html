<h4><em>A New Thread in the Pattern</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">P</span>errin
watched the mountains of Kinslayer&rsquo;s Dagger
uncomfortably as he rode. The way still slanted upwards, and looked
as if it would climb forever, though he thought the crest of the
pass must not be too much further. To one side of the trail, the
land sloped sharply down to a shallow mountain stream, dashing
itself to froth over sharp rocks; to the other side the mountains
reared in a series of jagged cliffs, like frozen stone waterfalls.
The trail itself ran through fields of boulders, some the size of a
man&rsquo;s head, and some as big as a cart. It would take no great skill
to hide in that.</p>

<p>The wolves said there were people in the mountains.
Perrin wondered if they were some of Fain&rsquo;s Darkfriends. The wolves
did not know, or care. They only knew the Twisted Ones were
somewhere ahead. Still far ahead, though Ingtar had pressed the
column hard. Perrin noticed that Uno was watching the mountains
around them much the way he himself was.</p>

<p>Mat, his bow slung across his back, rode with seeming
unconcern, juggling three colored balls, yet he looked paler than
he had. Verin examined him two and three times a day now, frowning,
and Perrin was sure she had even tried Healing at least once, but
it made no difference Perrin could see. In any case, she seemed to
be more absorbed in something about which she did not speak.</p>

<p><em>Rand</em>, Perrin thought, looking at the Aes
Sedai&rsquo;s back. She always rode at the head of the column with
Ingtar, and she always wanted them to move even faster than the
Shienaran lord would allow. <em>Somehow, she knows about Rand</em>.
Images from the wolves flickered in his head&mdash;stone
farmhouses and terraced villages, all beyond the mountain peaks;
the wolves saw them no differently than they saw hills or meadows,
except with a feeling that they were spoiled land. For a moment he
found himself sharing that regret, remembering places the two-legs
had long since abandoned, remembering the swift rush through the
trees, and the ham-stringing snap of his jaws as the deer tried to
flee, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;With an effort he pushed the wolves out of his
head. <em>These Aes Sedai are going to destroy all of us</em>.</p>

<p>Ingtar let his horse fall back beside Perrin&rsquo;s.
Sometimes, to Perrin&rsquo;s eyes, the crescent crest on the Shienaran&rsquo;s
helmet looked like a Trolloc&rsquo;s horns. Ingtar said softly, &ldquo;Tell me
again what the wolves said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you ten times,&rdquo; Perrin muttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me again! Anything I may have missed, anything
that will help me find the Horn&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Ingtar drew a breath and let
it out slowly. &ldquo;I must find the Horn of Valere, Perrin. Tell me
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no need for Perrin to order it in his mind,
not after so many repetitions. He droned it out. &ldquo;Someone&mdash;or
something&mdash;attacked the Darkfriends in the night and killed
those Trollocs we found.&rdquo; His stomach no longer lurched at that.
Ravens and vultures were messy feeders. &ldquo;The wolves call him&mdash;or it&mdash;Shadowkiller; I think it was a man, but they wouldn&rsquo;t
go close enough to see clearly. They are not afraid of this
Shadowkiller; awe is more like it. They say the Trollocs now follow
Shadowkiller. And they say Fain is with them&rdquo;&mdash;even after so
long the remembered smell of Fain, the feel of the man, made his
mouth twist&mdash;&ldquo;so the rest of the Darkfriends must be,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shadowkiller,&rdquo; Ingtar murmured. &ldquo;Something of the
Dark One, like a Myrddraal? I have seen things in the Blight that
might be called Shadowkillers, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Did they see nothing
else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They would not come close to him. It was not a Fade.
I&rsquo;ve told you, they will kill a Fade quicker than they will a
Trolloc, even if they lose half the pack. Ingtar, the wolves who
saw it passed this to others, then still others, before it reached
me. I can only tell you what they passed on, and after so many
tellings&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He let the words die as Uno joined them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aielman in the rocks,&rdquo; the one-eyed man said
quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This far from the Waste?&rdquo; Ingtar said incredulously.
Uno somehow managed to look offended without changing his
expression, and Ingtar added, &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t doubt you. I am just
surprised.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He flaming wanted me to see him, or I likely
wouldn&rsquo;t have.&rdquo; Uno sounded disgusted at admitting it. &ldquo;And his
bloody face wasn&rsquo;t veiled, so he&rsquo;s not out for killing. But when
you see one bloody Aiel, there&rsquo;s always more you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Suddenly
his eye widened. &ldquo;Burn me if it doesn&rsquo;t look like he bloody wants
more than to be seen.&rdquo; He pointed: a man had stepped into the way
ahead of them.</p>

<p>Instantly Masema&rsquo;s lance dropped to a couch, and he
dug his heels into his horse, leaping to a dead gallop in three
strides. He was not the only one; four steel points hurtled toward
the man on the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; Ingtar shouted. &ldquo;Hold, I said! I&rsquo;ll have the
ears of any man who doesn&rsquo;t stop where he stands!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Masema pulled in his horse viciously, sawing the
reins. The others also stopped, in a cloud of dust not ten paces
from the man, their lances still held steady on the man&rsquo;s chest. He
raised a hand to wave away the dust as it drifted toward him; it
was the first move he had made.</p>

<p>He was a tall man, with skin dark from the sun and
red hair cut short except for a tail in the back that hung to his
shoulders. From his soft, laced knee-high boots to the cloth
wrapped loosely around his neck, his clothes were all in shades of
brown and gray that would blend into rock or earth. The end of a
short horn bow peeked over his shoulder, and a quiver bristled with
arrows at his belt at one side. A long knife hung at the other. In
his left hand he gripped a round hide buckler and three short
spears, no more than half as long as he was tall, with points fully
as long as those of the Shienaran lances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no pipers to play the tune,&rdquo; the man
announced with a smile, &ldquo;but if you wish the dance&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He did
not change his stance, but Perrin caught a sudden air of readiness.
&ldquo;My name is Urien, of the Two Spires sept of the Reyn Aiel. I am a
Red Shield. Remember me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ingtar dismounted and walked forward, removing his
helmet. Perrin hesitated only a moment before climbing down to join
him. He could not miss the chance to see an Aiel close up. Acting
like a black-veiled Aiel. In story after story Aiel were as deadly
and dangerous as Trollocs&mdash;some even said they were all
Darkfriends&mdash;but Urien&rsquo;s smile somehow did not look dangerous
despite the fact that he seemed poised to leap. His eyes were
blue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He looks like Rand.&rdquo; Perrin looked around to see
that Mat had joined them, too. &ldquo;Maybe Ingtar&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Matt added
quietly. &ldquo;Maybe Rand is an Aiel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin nodded. &ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t change anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Mat sounded as if he were talking
about something beside what Perrin meant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are both far from our homes,&rdquo; Ingtar said to the
Aiel, &ldquo;and we, at least, have come for other things than fighting.&rdquo;
Perrin revised his opinion of Urien&rsquo;s smile; the man actually
looked disappointed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you wish it, Shienaran.&rdquo; Urien turned to Verin,
just getting down off her horse, and made an odd bow, digging the
points of his spears into the ground and extending his right hand,
palm up. His voice became respectful. &ldquo;Wise One, my water is
yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verin handed her reins to one of the soldiers. She
studied the Aiel as she came closer. &ldquo;Why do you call me that? Do
you take me for an Aiel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Wise One. But you have the look of those who
have made the journey to Rhuidean and survived. The years do not
touch the Wise Ones in the same way as other women, or as they
touch men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An excited look appeared on the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s face, but
Ingtar spoke impatiently. &ldquo;We are following Darkfriends and
Trollocs, Urien. Have you seen any sign of them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trollocs? Here?&rdquo; Urien&rsquo;s eyes brightened. &ldquo;It is one
of the signs the prophecies speak of. When the Trollocs come out of
the Blight again, we will leave the Three-fold Land and take back
our places of old.&rdquo; There was muttering from the mounted
Shienarans. Urien eyed them with a pride that made him seem to be
looking down from a height.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Three-fold Land?&rdquo; Mat said.</p>

<p>Perrin thought he looked still paler; not sick,
exactly, but as if he had been out of the sun too long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You call it the Waste,&rdquo; Urien said. &ldquo;To us it is the
Three-fold Land. A shaping stone, to make, us; a testing ground, to
prove our worth; and a punishment for the sin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What sin?&rdquo; Mat asked. Perrin caught his breath,
waiting for the spears in Urien&rsquo;s hand to flash.</p>

<p>The Aiel shrugged. &ldquo;So long ago it was, that none
remember. Except the Wise Ones and the clan chiefs, and they will
not speak of it. It must have been a very great sin if they cannot
bring themselves to tell us, but the Creator punishes us well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trollocs,&rdquo; Ingtar persisted. &ldquo;Have you seen
Trollocs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Urien shook his head. &ldquo;I would have killed them if I
had, but I have seen nothing but the rocks and the sky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ingtar shook his head, losing interest, but Verin
spoke, sharp concentration in her voice. &ldquo;This Rhuidean. What is
it? Where is it? How are the girls chosen to go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Urien&rsquo;s face went flat, his eyes hooded. &ldquo;I cannot
speak of it, Wise One.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In spite of himself Perrin&rsquo;s hand gripped his axe.
There was that in Urien&rsquo;s voice. Ingtar had also set himself, ready
to reach for his sword, and there was a stir among the mounted men.
But Verin stepped up to the Aiel, until she was almost touching his
chest, and looked up into his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not a Wise One as you know them, Urien,&rdquo; she
said insistently. &ldquo;I am Aes Sedai. Tell me what you can say of
Rhuidean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man who had been ready to face twenty men now
looked as if he wished for an escape from this one plump woman with
graying hair. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;can tell you only what is known to all.
Rhuidean lies in the lands of the Jenn Aiel, the thirteenth clan. I
cannot speak of them except to name them. None may go there save
women who wish to become Wise Ones, or men who wish to be clan
chiefs. Perhaps the Jenn Aiel choose among them; I do not know.
Many go; few return, and those are marked as what they are&mdash;Wise Ones, or clan chiefs. No more can I say, Aes Sedai. No
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verin continued to look up at him, pursing her
lips.</p>

<p>Urien looked at the sky as though he was trying to
remember it. &ldquo;Will you slay me now, Aes Sedai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She blinked. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you slay me now? One of the old prophecies says
that if ever we fail the Aes Sedai again, they will slay us. I know
your power is greater than that of the Wise Ones.&rdquo; The Aiel laughed
suddenly, mirthlessly. There was a wild light in his eyes. &ldquo;Bring
your lightnings, Aes Sedai. I will dance with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aiel thought he was going to die, and he was not
afraid. Perrin realized his mouth was open and closed it with a
snap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would I not give,&rdquo; Verin murmured, gazing up at
Urien, &ldquo;to have you in the White Tower. Or just willing to talk.
Oh, be still, man. I won&rsquo;t harm you. Unless you mean to harm me,
with your talk of dancing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Urien seemed astounded. He looked at the Shienarans,
sitting their horses all around, as if he suspected some trick.
&ldquo;You are not a Maiden of the Spear,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;How could I
strike at a woman who has not wedded the spear? It is forbidden
except to save life, and then I would take wounds to avoid it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you here, so far from your own lands?&rdquo; she
asked. &ldquo;Why did you come to us? You could have remained in the
rocks, and we would never have known you were there.&rdquo; The Aiel
hesitated, and she added, &ldquo;Tell only what you are willing to say. I
do not know what your Wise Ones do, but I&rsquo;ll not harm you, or try
to force you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So the Wise Ones say,&rdquo; Urien said dryly, &ldquo;yet even a
clan chief must have a strong belly to avoid doing as they want.&rdquo;
He seemed to be picking his words carefully. &ldquo;I search for&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;someone. A man.&rdquo; His eye ran across Perrin, Mat, the Shienarans,
dismissing them all. &ldquo;He Who Comes With the Dawn. It is said there
will be great signs and portents of his coming. I saw that you were
from Shienar by your escort&rsquo;s armor, and you had the look of a Wise
One, so I thought you might have word of great events, the events
that might herald him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man?&rdquo; Verin&rsquo;s voice was soft, but her eyes were as
sharp as daggers. &ldquo;What are these signs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Urien shook his head. &ldquo;It is said we will know them
when we hear of them, as we will know him when we see him, for he
will be marked. He will come from the west, beyond the Spine of the
World, but be of our blood. He will go to Rhuidean, and lead us out
of the Three-fold Land.&rdquo; He took a spear in his right hand. Leather
and metal creaked as soldiers reached for their swords, and Perrin
realized he had taken hold of his axe again, but Verin waved them
all to stillness with an irritated look. In the dirt Urien scraped
a circle with his spearpoint, then drew across it a sinuous line.
&ldquo;It is said that under this sign, he will conquer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ingtar frowned at the symbol, no recognition on his
face, but Mat muttered something coarsely under his breath, and
Perrin felt his mouth go dry. <em>The ancient symbol of the Aes
Sedai</em>.</p>

<p>Verin scraped the marking away with her foot. &ldquo;I
cannot tell you where he is, Urien,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I have heard of
no signs or portents to guide you to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I will continue my search.&rdquo; It was not a
question, yet Urien waited until she nodded before he eyed the
Shienarans proudly, challengingly, then turned his back on them. He
walked away smoothly, and vanished into the rocks without looking
back.</p>

<p>Some of the soldiers began muttering. Uno said
something about &ldquo;crazy bloody Aiel,&rdquo; and Masema growled that they
should have left the Aiel for the ravens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have wasted valuable time,&rdquo; Ingtar announced
loudly. &ldquo;We will ride harder to make it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Verin said, &ldquo;we must ride harder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ingtar glanced at her, but the Aes Sedai was staring
at the smudged ground, where her foot had obliterated the symbol.
&ldquo;Dismount,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;Armor on the packhorses. We&rsquo;re inside
Cairhien, now. We do not want the Cairhienin thinking we have come
to fight them. Be quick about it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat leaned close to Perrin. &ldquo;Do you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Do you
think he was talking about Rand? It&rsquo;s crazy, I know, but even
Ingtar thinks he&rsquo;s Aiel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Perrin said. &ldquo;Everything has been
crazy since we got mixed up with Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Softly, as to herself, Verin spoke, still staring at
the ground. &ldquo;It must be a part, and yet how? Does the Wheel of Time
weave threads into the Pattern of which we know nothing? Or does
the Dark One touch the Pattern again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin felt a chill.</p>

<p>Verin looked up at the soldiers removing their armor.
&ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; she commanded with more snap than Ingtar and Uno combined.
&ldquo;We must hurry!&rdquo;</p>
