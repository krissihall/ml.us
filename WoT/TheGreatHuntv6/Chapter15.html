way the strangely faded distant hills seemed to
slide toward Rand when he looked straight at them made his head
spin, unless he wrapped himself in the void. Sometimes the
emptiness crept up on him unawares, but he avoided it like death.
Better to be dizzy than share the void with that uneasy light.
Better by far to stare at the faded land. Still, he tried not to
look at anything too far away unless it lay right ahead of
them.</p>

<p>Hurin wore a fixed look as he concentrated on
sniffing the trail, as if he were trying to ignore the land the
trail crossed. When the sniffer did notice what lay around them, he
would give a start and wipe his hands on his coat, then push his
nose forward like a hound, eyes glazing, excluding everything else.
Loial rode slumped in his saddle and frowned as he glanced around,
ears twitching uneasily, muttering to himself.</p>

<p>Again they crossed land blackened and burned, even
the soil crunching under the horses&rsquo; hooves as if it had been
seared. The burned swathes, sometimes a mile wide, sometimes only a
few hundred paces, all ran east and west as straight as an arrow&rsquo;s
flight. Twice Rand saw the end of a burn, once as they rode over
it, once as they passed nearby; they tapered to points at the ends.
At least, the ends he saw were so, but he suspected they were all
the same.</p>

<p>Once he had watched Whatley Eldin decorate a cart for
Sunday, back home in Emond&rsquo;s Field, What painting the scenes in
bright colors, and the intricate scrollwork that surrounded them.
For the borders, What let the point of his brush touch the cart,
making a thin line that grew thicker as he pressed harder, then
thinner again as he eased up. That was how the land looked, as if
someone had streaked it with a monstrous brush of fire.</p>

<p>Nothing grew where the burns were, though some burns,
at least, had the feel of a thing long done. Not so much as a hint
of char remained in the air there, not a whiff even when he leaned
down to break off a black twig and smell it. Old, yet nothing had
come in to reclaim the land. Black gave way to green, and green to
black, along knife-edge lines.</p>

<p>In its own way, the rest of the land lay as dead as
the burns, though grass covered the ground and leaves covered the
trees. Everything had that faded look, like clothes too often
washed and too long left in the sun. There were no birds or
animals, not that Rand saw or heard. No hawk wheeling in the sky,
no bark of a hunting fox, no bird singing. Nothing rustled in the
grass or lit on a tree branch. No bees, or butterflies. Several
times they crossed streams, the water shallow, though often it had
dug itself a deep gulley with steep banks the horses had to
scramble down and climb on the other side. The water ran clear
except for the mud the horses&rsquo; hooves stirred, but never a minnow
or tadpole wriggled out of the roiling, not even a waterspider
dancing across the surface, or a hovering lacewing.</p>

<p>The water was drinkable, which was just as well,
since their waterbottles could not last forever. Rand tasted it
first, and made Loial and Hurin wait to see if anything happened to
him before he let them drink. He had gotten them into this; it was
his responsibility. The water was cool and wet, but that was the
best that could be said for it. It tasted flat, as if it had been
boiled. Loial made a face, and the horses did not like it either,
shaking their heads and drinking reluctantly.</p>

<p>There was one sign of life; at least, Rand thought it
must be so. Twice he saw a wispy streak crawling across the sky
like a line drawn with cloud. The lines were too straight to be
natural, it seemed, but he could not imagine what might make them.
He did not mention the lines to the others. Perhaps they did not
see, Hurin intent on the trail as he was and Loial drawn in on
himself. They said nothing of the lines, at any rate.</p>

<p>When they had ridden half the morning, Loial abruptly
swung down from his huge horse without a word and strode to a stand
of giantsbroom, their trunks splitting into many thick branches,
stiff and straight, not a pace above the ground. At the top, all
split again, into the leafy brush that gave them their name.</p>

<p>Rand pulled Red up and started to ask what he was
doing, but something about the Ogier&rsquo;s manner, as if he himself
were uncertain, kept Rand silent. After staring at the tree, Loial
put his hands on a trunk and began to sing in a deep, soft
rumble.</p>

<p>Rand had heard Ogier treesong, once, when Loial had
sung to a dying tree and brought it back to life, and he had heard
of sung wood, objects wrought from trees by the treesong. The
Talent was fading, Loial said; he was one of the few who had the
ability, now; that was what made sung wood even more sought after
and treasured. When he had heard Loial sing before, it had been as
if the earth itself sang, but now the Ogier murmured his song
almost diffidently, and the land echoed it in a whisper.</p>

<p>It seemed pure song, music without words, at least
none that Rand could make out; if there were words, they faded into
the music just as water pours into a stream. Hurin gasped and
stared.</p>

<p>Rand was not sure what it was Loial did, or how; soft
as the song was, it caught him up hypnotically, filling his mind
almost the way the void did. Loial ran his big hands along the
trunk, singing, caressing with his voice as well as his fingers.
The trunk now seemed smoother, somehow, as if his stroking were
shaping it. Rand blinked. He was sure the piece Loial worked on had
had branches at its top just like the others, but now it stopped in
a rounded end right above the Ogier&rsquo;s head. Rand opened his mouth,
but the song quieted him. It seemed so familiar, that song, as if
he should know it.</p>

<p>Abruptly Loial&rsquo;s voice rose to a climax&mdash;almost
a hymn of thanks, it sounded&mdash;and ended, fading as a breeze
fades.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn me,&rdquo; Hurin breathed. He looked stunned. &ldquo;Burn
me, I never heard anything like&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Burn me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In his hands Loial held a staff as tall as he was and
as thick as Rand&rsquo;s forearm, smooth and polished. Where the trunk
had been on the giantsbroom was a small stem of new growth.</p>

<p>Rand took a deep breath. <em>Always something new,
always something I didn&rsquo;t expect, and sometimes it isn&rsquo;t
horrible</em>.</p>

<p>He watched Loial mount, resting the staff across his
saddle in front of him, and wondered why the Ogier wanted a staff
at all, since they were riding. Then he saw the thick rod, not as
big as it was, but in relation to the Ogier, saw the way Loial
handled it. &ldquo;A quarterstaff,&rdquo; he said, surprised. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know
Ogier carried weapons, Loial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Usually we do not,&rdquo; the Ogier replied almost curtly.
&ldquo;Usually. The price has always been too high.&rdquo; He hefted the huge
quarterstaff and wrinkled his broad nose with distaste. &ldquo;Elder
Haman would surely say I am putting a long handle on my axe, but I
am not just being hasty or rash, Rand. This place&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He
shivered, and his ears twitched.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find our way back soon,&rdquo; Rand said, trying to
sound confident.</p>

<p>Loial spoke as if he had not heard. &ldquo;Everything is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;linked, Rand. Whether it lives or not, whether it thinks or
not, everything that <em>is</em>, fits together. The tree does not
think, but it is part of the whole, and the whole has a&mdash;a
feeling. I can&rsquo;t explain any more than I can explain what being
happy is, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Rand, this land was glad for a weapon to be
made. Glad!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light shine on us,&rdquo; Hurin murmured nervously,
&ldquo;and the Creator&rsquo;s hand shelter us. Though we go to the last
embrace of the mother, the Light illumine our way.&rdquo; He kept
repeating the catechism as if it had a charm to protect him.</p>

<p>Rand resisted the impulse to look around. He
definitely did not look up. All it would take to break them all was
another of those smoky lines across the sky right at that moment.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing here to hurt us,&rdquo; he said firmly. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll keep
a good watch and make sure nothing does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He wanted to laugh at himself, sounding so certain.
He was not certain about anything. But watching the others&mdash;Loial with his tufted ears drooping, and Hurin trying not to look
at anything&mdash;he knew one of them had to seem to be sure, at
least, or fear and uncertainty would break them all apart. <em>The
Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills</em>. He squeezed that thought out.
<em>Nothing to do with the Wheel. Nothing to with</em> ta&rsquo;veren,
<em>or Aes Sedai, or the Dragon. It&rsquo;s just the way it is, that&rsquo;s
all</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Loial, are you done here?&rdquo; The Ogier nodded,
regretfully rubbing the quarterstaff. Rand turned to Hurin. &ldquo;Do you
still have the trail?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do, Lord Rand. I do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s keep on with it. Once we find Fain and
the Darkfriends, why, we&rsquo;ll go home heroes, with the dagger for
Mat, and the Horn of Valere. Lead out, Hurin.&rdquo; <em>Heroes? I&rsquo;ll
settle for all of us getting out of here alive</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not like this place,&rdquo; the Ogier announced
flatly. He held the quarterstaff as if he expected to have to use
it soon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As well we don&rsquo;t mean to stay here, then, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
Rand said. Hurin barked a laugh as if he had made a joke, but Loial
gave him a level look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As well we don&rsquo;t, Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet as they rode on southward, he could see that his
casual assumption that they would get home had picked them both up
a little. Hurin sat a bit straighter in his saddle, and Loial&rsquo;s
ears did not seem so wilted. It was no time or place to let them
know he shared their fear, so he kept it to himself, and fought it
by himself.</p>

<p>Hurin kept his humor through the morning, murmuring,
&ldquo;As well we don&rsquo;t mean to stay,&rdquo; then chuckling, until Rand felt
like telling him to be quiet. Toward midday, the sniffer did fall
silent, though, shaking his head and frowning, and Rand found he
wished the man was still repeating his words and laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there something wrong with the trail, Hurin?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>The sniffer shrugged, looking troubled. &ldquo;Yes, Lord
Rand, and then again no, as you might say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be one or the other. Have you lost the
trail? No shame if you have. You said it was weak to start. If we
can&rsquo;t find the Darkfriends, we will find another Stone and get back
that way.&rdquo; <em>Light, anything but that</em>. Rand kept his face
smooth. &ldquo;If Darkfriends can come here and leave, so can we.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I haven&rsquo;t lost it, Lord Rand. I can still pick
out the stink of them. It isn&rsquo;t that. It&rsquo;s just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;
With a grimace, Hurin burst out, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m remembering it,
Lord Rand, instead of smelling it. But I&rsquo;m not. There&rsquo;s dozens of
trails crossing it all the time, dozens and dozens, and all sorts
of smells of violence, some of them fresh, almost, only washed out
like everything else. This morning, right after we left the hollow,
I could have sworn there were hundreds slaughtered right under my
feet, just minutes before, but there weren&rsquo;t any bodies, and not a
mark on the grass but our own hoofprints. A thing like that
couldn&rsquo;t happen without the ground being torn up and bloodied, but
there wasn&rsquo;t a mark. It&rsquo;s all like that, my Lord. But I am
following the trail. I am. This place just has me all on edge.
That&rsquo;s it. That must be it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand glanced at Loial&mdash;the Ogier did come up
with the oddest knowledge, at times&mdash;but he looked as puzzled
as Hurin. Rand made his voice more confident than he felt. &ldquo;I know
you are doing your best, Hurin. We are all of us on edge. Just
follow as best you can, and we&rsquo;ll find them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you say, Lord Rand.&rdquo; Hurin booted his horse
forward. &ldquo;As you say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But by nightfall, there was still no sign of the
Darkfriends, and Hurin said the trail was fainter still. The
sniffer kept muttering to himself about &ldquo;remembering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There had been no sign. Really no sign. Rand was not
as good a tracker as Uno, but any boy in the Two Rivers was
expected to track well enough to find a lost sheep, or a rabbit for
dinner. He had seen nothing. It was as if no living thing had ever
disturbed the land before they came. There should have been
something if the Darkfriends were ahead of them. But Hurin kept
following the trail he said he smelled.</p>

<p>As the sun touched the horizon they made camp in a
stand of trees untouched by the burn, eating from their saddlebags.
Flatbread and dried meat washed down with flat-tasting water;
hardly a filling meal, tough and far from tasty. Rand thought they
might have enough for a week. After that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Hurin ate slowly,
determinedly, but Loial gulped his down with a grimace and settled
back with his pipe, the big quarterstaff close at hand. Rand kept
their fire small and well hidden in the trees. Fain and his
Darkfriends and Trollocs might be close enough to see a fire, for
all of Hurin&rsquo;s worries about the oddness of their trail.</p>

<p>It seemed odd to him that he had begun to think of
them as Fain&rsquo;s Darkfriends, Fain&rsquo;s Trollocs. Fain was just a
madman. <em>Then why did they rescue him?</em> Fain had been part
of the Dark One&rsquo;s scheme to find him. Perhaps it had something to
do with that. <em>Then why is he running instead of chasing me? And
what killed that Fade? What happened in that room full of flies?
And those eyes, watching me in Fal Dara. And that wind, catching me
like a beetle in pine sap. No. No, Ba&rsquo;alzamon has to be dead</em>.
The Aes Sedai did not believe it. Moiraine did not believe it, nor
the Amyrlin. Stubbornly, he refused to think about it any longer.
All he had to think about now was finding that dagger for Mat.
Finding Fain, and the Horn.</p>

<p><em>It&rsquo;s never over, al&rsquo;Thor.</em></p>

<p>The voice was like a thin breeze whispering in the
back of his head, a thin, icy murmur working its way into the
crevices of his mind. He almost sought the void to escape it, but
remembering what waited for him there, he pushed down the
desire.</p>

<p>In the half dark of twilight, he worked the forms
with his sword, the way Lan had taught, though without the void.
Parting the Silk. Hummingbird Kisses the Honeyrose. Heron Wading in
the Rushes, for balance. Losing himself in the swift, sure
movements, forgetting for a time where he was, he worked until
sweat covered him. Yet when he was done, it all came back; nothing
was changed. The weather was not cold, but he shivered and pulled
his cloak around him as he hunched by the fire. The others caught
his mood, and they finished eating quickly and in silence. No one
complained when he kicked dirt over the last fitful flames.</p>

<p>Rand took the first watch himself, walking the edges
of the copse with his bow, sometimes easing his sword in its
scabbard. The chill moon was almost full, standing high in the
blackness, and the night was as silent as the day had been, as
empty. Empty was the right word. The land was as empty as a dusty
milk crock. It was hard to believe there was anyone in the whole
world, in this world, except for the three of them, hard to believe
even the Darkfriends were there, somewhere ahead.</p>

<p>To keep himself company, he unwrapped Thom Merrilin&rsquo;s
cloak, exposing the harp and flute in their hard leather cases atop
the many-colored patches. He took the gold-and-silver flute from
its case, remembering the gleeman teaching him as he fingered it,
and played a few notes of &ldquo;The Wind That Shakes the Willow,&rdquo; softly
so as not to wake the others. Even soft, the sad sound was too loud
in that place, too real. With a sigh he replaced the flute and did
up the bundle again.</p>

<p>He held the watch long into the night, letting the
others sleep. He did not know how late it was when he suddenly
realized a fog had risen. Close to the ground it lay, thick, making
Hurin and Loial indistinct mounds seeming to hump out of clouds.
Thinner higher up, it still shrouded the land around them, hiding
everything except the nearest trees. The moon seemed viewed through
watered silk. Anything at all could come right up to them unseen.
He touched his sword.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Swords do no good against me, Lews Therin. You
should know that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fog swirled around Rand&rsquo;s feet as he spun, the
sword coming into his hands, heron-mark blade upright before him.
The void leaped up inside him; for the first time, he barely
noticed the tainted light of <em>saidin</em>.</p>

<p>A shadowy figure drew nearer through the mist,
walking with a tall staff. Behind it, as if the shadow&rsquo;s shadow
were vast, the fog darkened till it was blacker than night. Rand&rsquo;s
skin crawled. Closer the figure came, until it resolved into the
shape of a man, clothed and gloved in black, with a black silk mask
covering his face, and the shadow came with it. His staff was
black, too, as if the wood had been charred, yet smooth and shining
like water by moonlight. For an instant the eyeholes of the mask
glowed, as if fires stood behind them rather than eyes, but Rand
did not need that to know who it was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Ba&rsquo;alzamon,</em>&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;This is a dream.
It has to be. I fell asleep, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ba&rsquo;alzamon laughed like the roar of an open furnace.
&ldquo;You always try to deny what is, Lews Therin. If I stretch out my
hand, I can touch you, Kinslayer. I can always touch you. Always
and everywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not the Dragon! My name is Rand al&rsquo;&mdash;!&rdquo;
Rand clamped his teeth shut to stop himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know the name you use now, Lews Therin. I know
every name you have used through Age after Age, long before you
were even the Kinslayer.&rdquo; Ba&rsquo;alzamon&rsquo;s voice began to rise in
intensity; sometimes the fires of his eyes flared so high that Rand
could see them through the openings in the silk mask, see them like
endless seas of flame. &ldquo;I know you, know your blood and your line
back to the first spark of life that ever was, back to the First
Moment. You can never hide from me. Never! We are tied together as
surely as two sides of the same coin. Ordinary men may hide in the
sweep of the Pattern, but <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> stand out like beacon
fires on a hill, and you, <em>you</em> stand out as if ten thousand
shining arrows stood in the sky to point you out! You are mine, and
ever in reach of my hand!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father of Lies!&rdquo; Rand managed. Despite the void, his
tongue wanted to cleave to the roof of his mouth. <em>Light, please
let it be a dream</em>. The thought skittered outside the
emptiness. <em>Even one of those dreams that isn&rsquo;t a dream. He
can&rsquo;t really be standing in front of me. The Dark One is sealed in
Shayol Ghul, sealed by the Creator at the moment of Creation</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He knew too much of the truth for it to help. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re well
named! If you could just take me, why haven&rsquo;t you? Because you
cannot. I walk in the Light, and you cannot touch me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ba&rsquo;alzamon leaned on his staff and looked at Rand a
moment, then moved to stand over Loial and Hurin, peering down at
them. The vast shadow moved with him. He did not disturb the fog,
Rand saw&mdash;he moved, the staff swung with his steps, but the
gray mist did not swirl and eddy around his feet as it did around
Rand&rsquo;s. That gave him heart. Perhaps Ba&rsquo;alzamon really was <em>
not</em> there. Perhaps it was a dream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You find odd followers,&rdquo; Ba&rsquo;alzamon mused. &ldquo;You
always did. These two. The girl who tries to watch over you. A poor
guardian and weak, Kinslayer. If she had a lifetime to grow, she
would never grow strong enough for you to hide behind.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Girl? Who? Moiraine is surely not a girl</em>. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about, Father of Lies. You lie, and
lie, and even when you tell the truth, you twist it to a lie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I, Lews Therin? You know what you are, who you
are. I have told you. And so have those women of Tar Valon.&rdquo; Rand
shifted, and Ba&rsquo;alzamon gave a laugh, like a small thunderclap.
&ldquo;They think themselves safe in their White Tower, but my followers
number even some of their own. The Aes Sedai called Moiraine told
you who you are, did she not? Did she lie? Or is she one of mine?
The White Tower means to use you like a hound on a leash. Do I lie?
Do I lie when I say you seek the Horn of Valere?&rdquo; He laughed again;
calm of the void or no, it was all Rand could do not to cover his
ears. &ldquo;Sometimes old enemies fight so long that they become allies
and never realize it. They think they strike at you, but they have
become so closely linked it is as if you guided the blow
yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t guide me,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;I deny you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a thousand strings tied to you, Kinslayer,
each one finer than silk and stronger than steel. Time has tied a
thousand cords between us. The battle we two have fought&mdash;do
you remember any part of that? Do you have any glimmering that we
have fought before, battles without number back to the beginning of
Time? I know much that you do not! That battle will soon end. The
Last Battle is coming. The last, Lews Therin. Do you really think
you can avoid it? You poor, shivering worm. You will serve me or
die! And this time the cycle will not begin anew with your death.
The grave belongs to the Great Lord of the Dark. This time if you
die, you will be destroyed utterly. This time the Wheel will be
broken whatever you do, and the world remade to a new mold. Serve
me! Serve Shai&rsquo;tan, or be destroyed forever!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With the utterance of that name, the air seemed to
thicken. The darkness behind Ba&rsquo;alzamon swelled and grew,
threatening to swallow everything. Rand felt it engulfing him,
colder than ice and hotter than coals both at the same time,
blacker than death, sucking him into the depths of it, overwhelming
the world.</p>

<p>He gripped his sword hilt till his knuckles hurt. &ldquo;I
deny you, and I deny your power. I walk in the Light. The Light
preserves us, and we shelter in the palm of the Creator&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo; He
blinked. Ba&rsquo;alzamon still stood there, and the great darkness still
hung behind him, but it was as if all the rest had been
illusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want to see my face?&rdquo; It was a whisper.</p>

<p>Rand swallowed. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should.&rdquo; A gloved hand went to the black
mask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mask came away. It was a man&rsquo;s face, horribly
burned. Yet between the black-edged, red crevices crossing those
features, the skin looked healthy and smooth. Dark eyes looked at
Rand; cruel lips smiled with a flash of white teeth. &ldquo;Look at me,
Kinslayer, and see the hundredth part of your own fate.&rdquo; For a
moment eyes and mouth became doorways into endless caverns of fire.
&ldquo;This is what the Power unchecked can do, even to me. But I heal,
Lews Therin. I know the paths to greater power. It will burn you
like a moth flying into a furnace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not touch it!&rdquo; Rand felt the void around him,
felt <em>saidin</em>. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot stop yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave&mdash;me&mdash;ALONE!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Power.&rdquo; Ba&rsquo;alzamon&rsquo;s voice became soft, insinuating.
&ldquo;You can have power again, Lews Therin. You are linked to it now,
this moment. I know it. I can see it. Feel it, Lews Therin. Feel
the glow inside you. Feel the power that could be yours. All you
must do is reach out for it. But the Shadow is there between you
and it. Madness and death. You need not die, Lews Therin, not ever
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Rand said, but the voice went on, burrowing
into him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can teach you to control that power so that it
does not destroy you. No one else lives who can teach you that. The
Great Lord of the Dark can shelter you from the madness. The power
can be yours, and you can live forever. Forever! All you must do in
return is serve. Only serve. Simple words&mdash;I am yours, Great
Lord&mdash;and power will be yours. Power beyond anything those
women of Tar Valon dream of, and life eternal, if you will only
offer yourself up and serve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand licked his lips. <em>Not to go mad. Not to
die</em>. &ldquo;Never! I walk in the Light,&rdquo; he grated hoarsely, &ldquo;and
you can never touch me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Touch you, Lews Therin? Touch you? I can consume
you! Taste it and know, as I knew!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those dark eyes became fire again, and that mouth,
flame that blossomed and grew until it seemed brighter than a
summer sun. Grew, and suddenly Rand&rsquo;s sword glowed as if just drawn
from the forge. He cried out as the hilt burned his hands, screamed
and dropped the sword. And the fog caught fire, fire that leaped,
fire that burned everything.</p>

<p>Yelling, Rand beat at his clothes as they smoked and
charred and fell in ashes, beat with hands that blackened and
shriveled as naked flesh cracked and peeled away in the flames. He
screamed. Pain beat at the void inside him, and he tried to crawl
deeper into the emptiness. The glow was there, the tainted light
just out of sight. Half mad, no longer caring what it was, he
reached for <em>saidin</em>, tried to wrap it around him, tried to
hide in it from the burning and the pain.</p>

<p>As suddenly as the fire began, it was gone. Rand
stared wonderingly at his hand sticking out of the red sleeve of
his coat. There was not so much as a singe on the wool. <em>I
imagined it all</em>. Frantically, he looked around. Ba&rsquo;alzamon was
gone. Hurin shifted in his sleep; the sniffer and Loial were still
only two mounds sticking up out of the low fog. <em>I did imagine
it</em>.</p>

<p>Before relief had a chance to grow, pain stabbed his
right hand, and he turned it up to look. There across the palm was
branded a heron. The heron from the hilt of his sword, angry and
red, as neatly done as though drawn with an artist&rsquo;s skill.</p>
