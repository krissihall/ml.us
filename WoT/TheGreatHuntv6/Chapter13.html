<h4><em>From Stone to Stone</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
light of the rising sun woke Rand, and he
wondered if he were dreaming. He sat up slowly, staring. Everything
had changed, or almost everything. The sun and the sky were as he
expected to see, if pallid and all but cloudless. Loial and Hurin
still lay on either side of him, wrapped in their cloaks asleep,
and their horses still stood hobbled a pace away, but everyone else
was gone. Soldiers, horses, his friends, everyone and everything
gone.</p>

<p>The hollow itself had changed, too, and they were in
the middle of it now, no longer on the edge. At Rand&rsquo;s head rose a
gray stone cylinder, every bit of three spans high and a full pace
thick, covered with hundreds, perhaps thousands, of deeply incised
diagrams and markings in some language he did not recognize. White
stone paved the bottom of the hollow, as level as a floor, polished
so smooth it almost glistened. Broad, high steps rose to the rim in
concentric rings of different colored stone. And about the rim, the
trees stood blackened and twisted as if a firestorm had roared
through them. Everything seemed paler than it should be, just like
the sun, more subdued, as if seen through mist. Only there was no
mist. Just the three of them and the horses appeared truly solid.
But when he touched the stone under him, it <em>felt</em> solid
enough.</p>

<p>He reached out and shook Loial and Hurin. &ldquo;Wake up!
Wake up and tell me I&rsquo;m dreaming. Please wake up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it morning already?&rdquo; Loial began, sitting up,
then his mouth fell open, and his big, round eyes grew wider and
wider.</p>

<p>Hurin woke with a start, then leaped to his feet,
jumping like a flea on a hot rock to look this way, then that.
&ldquo;Where are we? What&rsquo;s happened? Where is everybody? Where are we,
Lord Rand?&rdquo; He sank to his knees, wringing his hands, but his eyes
still darted. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Rand said slowly. &ldquo;I was hoping it
was a dream, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Maybe it is a dream.&rdquo; He had had experience
of dreams that were not dreams, experience he wanted neither to
repeat nor to remember. He stood up carefully. Everything stayed as
it was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think so,&rdquo; Loial said. He was studying the
column, and he did not appear happy. His long eyebrows sagged
across his cheeks, and his tufted ears seemed to have wilted. &ldquo;I
think this is the same stone we went to sleep beside last night. I
think I know what it is, now.&rdquo; For once, he sounded miserable about
knowing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; <em>No</em>. That being the same stone
was no more crazy than what he could see around him, Mat and Perrin
and the Shienarans gone, and everything changed. <em>I thought I&rsquo;d
escaped, but it&rsquo;s started again, and there&rsquo;s no such thing as crazy
anymore. Unless I am</em>. He looked at Loial and Hurin. They were
not acting as if he were mad; they saw it, too. Something about the
steps caught his eye, the different colors, seven rising from blue
to red. &ldquo;One for each Ajah,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Lord Rand,&rdquo; Hurin moaned. &ldquo;No. Aes Sedai would
not do this to us. They wouldn&rsquo;t! I walk in the Light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We all do, Hurin,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;The Aes Sedai won&rsquo;t
hurt you.&rdquo; <em>Unless you get in the way</em>. Could this be
Moiraine&rsquo;s doing somehow? &ldquo;Loial, you said you know what the stone
is. What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said I think I know, Rand. There was a piece of an
old book, just a few pages, but one of them had a drawing of this
stone, this Stone&rdquo;&mdash;there was a distinct difference in the
way he said it that marked importance&mdash;&ldquo;or one very like it.
And underneath, it said, &lsquo;From Stone to Stone run the lines of
&ldquo;if,&rdquo; between the worlds that might be.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does that mean, Loial? It doesn&rsquo;t make any
sense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Ogier shook his massive head sadly. &ldquo;It was only
a few pages. Part of it said Aes Sedai in the Age of Legends, some
of those who could Travel, the most powerful of them, could use
these Stones. It did not say how, but I think, from what I could
puzzle out, that perhaps those Aes Sedai used the Stones somehow to
journey to those worlds.&rdquo; He glanced up at the seared trees and
pulled his eyes down again quickly, as he did not want to think
about what lay beyond the rim. &ldquo;Yet even if Aes Sedai can use them,
or could, we had no Aes Sedai with us to channel the Power, so I
don&rsquo;t see how it can be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s skin prickled. <em>Aes Sedai used them. In the
Age of Legends, when there were male Aes Sedai</em>. He had a vague
memory of the void closing round him as he fell asleep, filled with
that uneasy glow. And he remembered the room in the village, and
the light he had reached for to escape. <em>If that was the male
half of the True Source</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>No, it can&rsquo;t be. But what if it
is? Light, I was wondering whether to run or not, and all the time
it&rsquo;s right inside my head. Maybe I brought us here</em>. He did not
want to think about it. &ldquo;Worlds that might be? I don&rsquo;t understand,
Loial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Ogier shrugged massively, and uneasily. &ldquo;Neither
do I, Rand. Most of it sounded like this. &lsquo;If a woman go left, or
right, does Time&rsquo;s flow divide? Does the Wheel then weave two
Patterns? A thousand, for each of her turnings? As many as the
stars? Is one real, the others merely shadows and reflections?&rsquo; You
see, it was not very clear. Mainly questions, most of which seemed
to contradict each other. And there just wasn&rsquo;t much of it.&rdquo; He
went back to staring at the column, but he looked as if he wished
it would go away. &ldquo;There are supposed to be a good many of these
Stones, scattered all over the world, or there were, once, but I
never heard of anyone finding one. I never heard of anyone finding
anything like this at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord Rand?&rdquo; Now on his feet, Hurin seemed calmer,
but he clutched his coat at the waist with both hands, his face
urgent. &ldquo;My Lord Rand, you&rsquo;ll get us back, won&rsquo;t you? Back where we
belong? I&rsquo;ve a wife, my Lord, and children. Melia&rsquo;d take it bad
enough, me dying, but if she doesn&rsquo;t even have my body to give to
the mother&rsquo;s embrace, she&rsquo;ll grieve to the end of her days. You
understand, my Lord. I can&rsquo;t leave her not knowing. You&rsquo;ll get us
back. And if I die, if you can&rsquo;t take her my body, you&rsquo;ll let her
know, so she has that, at least.&rdquo; He was no longer questioning at
the end. A note of confidence had crept into his voice.</p>

<p>Rand opened his mouth to say again he was not a lord,
then shut it without speaking. That was hardly important enough to
mention, now. <em>You got him into this</em>. He wanted to deny it,
but he knew what he was, knew he could channel, even if it always
seemed to happen all by itself. Loial said Aes Sedai used the
Stones, and that meant the One Power. What Loial said he knew, you
could be sure of&mdash;the Ogier never claimed to know if he did
not&mdash;and there was no one else nearby who could wield the
Power. <em>You got him into it, you have to get him out. You have
to try</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do my best, Hurin.&rdquo; And because Hurin was
Shienaran, he added, &ldquo;By my House and honor. A shepherd&rsquo;s House and
a shepherd&rsquo;s honor, but I&rsquo;ll make them do as well as a
lord&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hurin loosed his hold on his coat. The confidence
reached his eyes, too. He bowed deeply. &ldquo;Honor to serve, my
Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Guilt rippled through Rand. <em>He thinks you&rsquo;ll see
him home, now, because Shienaran lords always keep their word. What
are you going to do</em>, Lord <em>Rand?</em> &ldquo;None of that, Hurin.
There&rsquo;ll be no bowing. I&rsquo;m not&mdash;&rdquo; Suddenly he knew he could
not tell the man again that he was not a lord. All that was holding
the sniffer together was his belief in a lord, and he could not
take that away, not now. Not here. &ldquo;No bowing,&rdquo; he finished
awkwardly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you say, Lord Rand.&rdquo; Hurin&rsquo;s grin was almost as
wide as when Rand first met him.</p>

<p>Rand cleared his throat. &ldquo;Yes. Well, that&rsquo;s what I
say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were both watching him, Loial curious, Hurin
confident, both waiting to see what he would do. <em>I brought them
here. I must have. So I have to get them back. And that means</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Drawing a deep breath, he walked across the white
paving stones to the symbol-covered cylinder. Small lines of some
language he did not know surrounded each symbol, odd letters that
flowed in curves and spirals, suddenly turned to jagged hooks and
angles, then flowed on. At least it was not Trolloc script.
Reluctantly, he put his hands on the column. It looked like any
dry, polished stone, but it felt curiously slick, like oiled
metal.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes and formed the flame. The void
came slowly, hesitantly. He knew his own fear was holding it back,
fear of what he was trying. As fast as he fed fear into the flame,
more came. <em>I can&rsquo;t do it. Channel the Power. I don&rsquo;t want to.
Light, there has to be another way</em>. Grimly he forced the
thoughts to stillness. He could feel sweat beading on his face.
Determinedly he kept on, pushing his fears into the consuming
flame, making it grow, and grow. And the void was there.</p>

<p>The core of him floated in emptiness. He could see
the light&mdash;<em>saidin</em>&mdash;even with his eyes closed,
feel the warmth of it, surrounding him, surrounding everything,
suffusing everything. It wavered like a candle flame seen through
oiled paper. Rancid oil. Stinking oil.</p>

<p>He reached for it&mdash;he was not sure <em>how</em>
he reached, but it was something, a movement, a stretching toward
the light, toward <em>saidin</em>&mdash;and caught nothing, as if
running his hands through water. It felt like a slimy pond, scum
floating atop clean water below, but he could not scoop up any of
the water. Time and again it trickled through his fingers, not even
droplets of the water remaining, only the slick scum, making his
skin crawl.</p>

<p>Desperately, he tried to form an image of the hollow
as it had been, with Ingtar and the lances sleeping by their
horses, with Mat and Perrin, and the Stone lying buried except for
one end. Outside the void he formed it, clinging to the shell of
emptiness that enclosed him. He tried to link the image with the
light, tried to force them together. The hollow as it had been, and
he and Loial and Hurin there together. His head hurt. Together,
with Mat and Perrin and the Shienarans. Burning, in his head.
Together!</p>

<p>The void shattered into a thousand razor shards,
slicing his mind.</p>

<p>Shuddering, he staggered back, wide-eyed. His hands
hurt from pressing the Stone, and his arms and shoulders quivered
with aching; his stomach lurched from the feel of filth covering
him, and his head&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He tried to steady his breathing. That had
never happened before. When the void went, it went like a pricked
bubble, just gone, in a twinkling. Never broken like glass. His
head felt numb, as if the thousand slashes had happened so quickly
the pain had not yet come. But every cut had felt as real as if
done with a knife. He touched his temple, and was surprised not to
see blood on his fingers.</p>

<p>Hurin still stood there watching him, still
confident. If anything, the sniffer seemed more sure by the minute.
Lord Rand was doing something. That was what lords were for. They
protected the land and the people with their bodies and their
lives, and when something was wrong, they set it aright and saw
fairness and justice done. As long as Rand was doing something,
anything, Hurin would have confidence that it would all come right
in the end. That was what lords did.</p>

<p>Loial had a different look, a slightly puzzled frown,
but his eyes were on Rand, too. Rand wondered what he was
thinking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was worth a try,&rdquo; he told them. The rancid oil
feel, inside his head&mdash;<em>Light, it&rsquo;s inside me! I don&rsquo;t
want it inside me!</em>&mdash;was fading slowly, but he still
thought he might vomit. &ldquo;I will try again, in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He hoped he sounded confident. He had no idea how the
Stones worked, if what he was doing had any chance of success. <em>
Maybe there are rules for working them. Maybe you have to do
something special. Light, maybe you can&rsquo;t use the same Stone twice,
or</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He cut off that line of thought. There was no good in
thinking like that. He had it to do. Looking at Loial and Hurin, he
thought he knew what Lan had meant about duty pressing down like a
mountain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord, I think&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Hurin let his words trail
off, looking abashed for a moment. &ldquo;My Lord, maybe, if we find the
Darkfriends, we can make one of them tell us how to get back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would ask a Darkfriend or the Dark One himself if
I thought I&rsquo;d get a true answer back,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;But we are all
there is. Just us three.&rdquo; <em>Just me. I&rsquo;m the one who has to do
it</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We could follow their trail, my Lord. If we catch
them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stared at the sniffer. &ldquo;You can still smell
them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can, my Lord.&rdquo; Hurin frowned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s faint, pale&mdash;like, like everything else here, but I can smell the trail.
Right up there.&rdquo; He pointed to the rim of the hollow. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
understand it, my Lord, but&mdash;Last night, I could have sworn
the trail went right on by the hollow back&mdash;back where we
were. Well, it&rsquo;s in the same place now, only here, and fainter,
like I said. Not old, not faint like that, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know,
Lord Rand, except that it&rsquo;s there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand considered. If Fain and the Darkfriends were
here&mdash;wherever here was&mdash;they might know how to get
back. They had to, if they had reached here in the first place. And
they had the Horn, and the dagger. Mat had to have that dagger. For
that if for nothing else, he had to find them. What finally decided
him, he was ashamed to realize, was that he was afraid to try
again. Afraid to try channeling the Power. He was less afraid of
confronting Darkfriends and Trollocs with only Hurin and Loial than
he was of that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we will go after the Darkfriends.&rdquo; He tried to
sound sure, the way Lan would, or Ingtar. &ldquo;The Horn must be
recovered. If we can&rsquo;t puzzle out a way to take it from them, at
least we will know where they are when we find Ingtar again.&rdquo; <em>
If only they don&rsquo;t ask how we&rsquo;re going to find him again</em>.
&ldquo;Hurin, make sure it really is the trail we&rsquo;re after.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sniffer leaped into his saddle, eager to be doing
something himself, perhaps eager to be away from the hollow, and
scrambled his horse up the broad, colored steps. The animal&rsquo;s
hooves rang loudly on the stone, but they made not a mark.</p>

<p>Rand stowed Red&rsquo;s hobbles in his saddlebags&mdash;the banner was still there; he would not have minded if that had
been left behind&mdash;then gathered his bow and quiver and
climbed to the stallion&rsquo;s back. The bundle of Thom Merrilin&rsquo;s cloak
made a mound behind his saddle.</p>

<p>Loial led his big mount over to him; with the Ogier
standing on the ground, Loial&rsquo;s head came almost to Rand&rsquo;s
shoulder, and him in his saddle. Loial still looked puzzled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think we should stay here?&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;Try
again to use the Stone? If the Darkfriends are here, in place, we
have to find them. We can&rsquo;t leave the Horn of Valere in Darkfriend
hands; you heard the Amyrlin. And we have to get that dagger back.
Mat will die without it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial nodded. &ldquo;Yes, Rand, we do. But, Rand, the
Stones&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will find another. You said they were scattered
all over, and if they&rsquo;re all like this&mdash;all this stonework
around them&mdash;it should not be too hard to find one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand, that fragment said the Stones came from an
older Age than the Age of Legends, and even the Aes Sedai then did
not understand them, though they used them, some of the truly
powerful did. They used them with the One Power, Rand. How did you
think to use this Stone to take us back? Or any other Stone we
find?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Rand could only stare at the Ogier,
thinking faster than he ever had in his life. &ldquo;If they are older
than the Age of Legends, maybe the people who built them didn&rsquo;t use
the Power. There must be another way. The Darkfriends got here, and
they certainly couldn&rsquo;t use the Power. Whatever this other way is,
I will find it out. I will get us back, Loial.&rdquo; He looked at the
tall stone column with its odd markings, and felt a prickle of
fear. <em>Light, if only I</em> don&rsquo;t <em>have to use the Power to
do it</em>. &ldquo;I will, Loial, I promise. One way or another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Ogier gave a doubtful nod. He swung up onto his
huge horse and followed Rand up the steps to join Hurin among the
blackened trees.</p>

<p>The land stretched out, low and rolling, sparsely
forested here and there with grassland between, crossed by more
than one stream. In the middle distance Rand thought he could see
another burned patch. It was all pale, the colors washed. There was
no sign of anything made by men except the stone circle behind
them. The sky was empty, no chimney smoke, no birds, only a few
clouds and the pale yellow sun.</p>

<p>Worst of all, though, the land seemed to twist the
eye. What was close at hand looked all right, and what was seen
straight ahead in the distance. But whenever Rand turned his head,
things that appeared distant when seen from the corner of his eye
seemed to rush toward him, to be nearer when he stared straight at
them. It made for dizziness; even the horses whickered nervously
and rolled their eyes. He tried moving his head slowly; the
apparent movement of things that should have been fixed was still
there, but it seemed to help a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did your piece of a book say anything about this?&rdquo;
Rand asked.</p>

<p>Loial shook his head, then swallowed hard as if he
wished he had kept it still. &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose there&rsquo;s nothing to do for it. Which way,
Hurin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;South, Lord Rand.&rdquo; The sniffer kept his eyes on the
ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;South, then.&rdquo; <em>There has to be a way back besides
using the Power</em>. Rand heeled Red&rsquo;s flanks. He tried to make
his voice lighthearted, as if he saw no difficulty at all in what
they were about. &ldquo;What was it Ingtar said? Three or four days to
that monument to Artur Hawkwing? I wonder if that exists here, too,
the way the Stones do. If this is a world that <em>could</em> be,
maybe it&rsquo;s still standing. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be something to see,
Loial?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They rode south.</p>
