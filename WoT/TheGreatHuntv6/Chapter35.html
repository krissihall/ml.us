<h4><em>Stedding Tsofu</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
river hills on which the city of Cairhien stood
gave way to flatter lands and forests when Rand and the others had
ridden half a day, the Shienarans still with their armor on the
packhorses. There were no roads where they went, only a scattering
of cart tracks, and few farms or villages. Verin pressed for speed,
and Ingtar&mdash;grumbling constantly that they were letting
themselves be tricked, that Fain would never have told them where
he was really going, yet grumbling at the same time about riding in
the opposite direction from Toman Head, as if part of him believed
and Toman Head were not months away except by the way they took&mdash;Ingtar obliged her. The Gray Owl banner flew on the wind of
their passage.</p>

<p>Rand rode with grim determination, avoiding
conversation with Verin. He had this thing to do&mdash;this duty, Ingtar
would have called it&mdash;and then he could be free of Aes Sedai
once and for all. Perrin seemed to share something of his mood,
staring straight ahead at nothing as they rode. When they finally
stopped for the night at the edge of a forest, with full dark
almost on them, Perrin asked Loial questions about the <em>
stedding</em>. Trollocs would not enter a <em>stedding</em>; would
wolves? Loial replied shortly that it was only creatures of the
Shadow that were reluctant to enter <em>stedding</em>. And Aes
Sedai, of course, since they could not touch the True Source inside
a <em>stedding</em>, or channel the One Power. The Ogier himself
appeared the most reluctant of all to go to Stedding Tsofu. Mat was
the only one who seemed eager, almost desperately so. His skin
looked as if he had not seen the sun in a year, and his cheeks had
begun to go hollow, though he said he felt ready to run a footrace.
Verin put her hands on him for Healing before he rolled into his
blankets, and again before they mounted their horses in the
morning, but it made no difference in how he looked. Even Hurin
frowned when he looked at Mat.</p>

<p>The sun stood high on the second day when Verin
suddenly sat up straight in her saddle and looked around. Beside
her, Ingtar gave a start.</p>

<p>Rand could not see anything different about the
forest now surrounding them. The undergrowth was not too thick;
they had found an easy way under the canopy of oak and hickory,
blackgum and beech, pierced here and there by a tall pine or
leatherleaf, or the white slash of a paperbark. But as he followed
them, he suddenly felt a chill pass through him, as though he had
leaped into a Waterwood pond in winter. It flashed through him and
was gone, leaving behind a feeling of refreshment. And there was a
dull and distant sense of loss, too, though he could not imagine of
what.</p>

<p>Every rider, as he reached that point, gave a jerk or
made some exclamation. Hurin&rsquo;s mouth dropped open, and Uno
whispered, &ldquo;Bloody, flaming&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Then he shook his head as if he
could not think of anything else to say. There was a look of
recognition in Perrin&rsquo;s yellow eyes.</p>

<p>Loial took a deep, slow breath and let it out. &ldquo;It
feels&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;good&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to be back in a <em>stedding</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frowning, Rand looked around. He had expected a <em>
stedding</em> to be somehow different, but except for that one
chill, the forest was the same as what they had been riding through
all day. There was the sudden sense of being rested, of course.
Then an Ogier stepped out from behind an oak.</p>

<p>She was shorter than Loial&mdash;which meant she
stood head and shoulders taller than Rand&mdash;but with the same
broad nose and big eyes, the same wide mouth and tufted ears. Her
eyebrows were not so long as Loial&rsquo;s, though, and her features
seemed delicate beside his, the tufts on her ears finer. She wore a
long green dress and a green cloak embroidered with flowers, and
carried a bunch of silverbell blossoms as if she had been gathering
them. She looked at them calmly, waiting.</p>

<p>Loial scrambled down from his tall horse and bowed
hastily. Rand and the others did the same, if not so quickly as
Loial; even Verin inclined her head. Loial gave their names
formally, but he did not mention the name of his <em>
stedding</em>.</p>

<p>For a moment the Ogier girl&mdash;Rand was sure she
was no older than Loial&mdash;studied them, then smiled. &ldquo;Be
welcome to Stedding Tsofu.&rdquo; Her voice was a lighter version of
Loial&rsquo;s, too; the softer rumble of a smaller bumblebee. &ldquo;I am
Erith, daughter of Iva daughter of Alar. Be welcome. We have had so
few human visitors since the stonemasons left Cairhien, and now so
many at once. Why, we even had some of the Traveling People,
though, of course, they left when the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Oh, I talk too much. I
will take you to the Elders. Only&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She searched among them
for the one in charge, and settled finally on Verin. &ldquo;Aes Sedai,
you have so many men with you, and armed. Could you please leave
some of them Outside? Forgive me, but it is always unsettling to
have very many armed humans in the <em>stedding</em> at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, Erith,&rdquo; Verin said. &ldquo;Ingtar, will you see
to it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ingtar gave orders to Uno, and so it was that he and
Hurin were the only Shienarans to follow Erith deeper into the <em>
stedding</em>.</p>

<p>Leading his horse like the others, Rand looked up as
Loial came closer, with many glances at Erith up ahead with Verin
and Ingtar. Hurin walked midway between, staring around in
amazement, though Rand was not sure at what exactly. Loial bent to
speak quietly. &ldquo;Is she not beautiful, Rand? And her voice
sings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat snickered, but when Loial looked at him
questioningly, he said, &ldquo;Very pretty, Loial. A little tall for my
taste, you understand, but very pretty, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial frowned uncertainly, but nodded. &ldquo;Yes, she is.&rdquo;
His expression lightened. &ldquo;It does feel good to be back in a <em>
stedding</em>. Not that the Longing was taking me, you
understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Longing?&rdquo; Perrin said. &ldquo;I do not understand,
Loial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We Ogier are bound to the <em>stedding</em>, Perrin.
It is said that before the Breaking of the World, we could go where
we wished for as long as we wished, like you humans, but that
changed with the Breaking. Ogier were scattered like every other
people, and they could not find any of the <em>stedding</em> again.
Everything was moved, everything changed. Mountains, rivers, even
the seas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everybody knows about the Breaking,&rdquo; Mat said
impatiently. &ldquo;What does it have to do with this&mdash;this
Longing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was during the Exile, while we wandered lost,
that the Longing first came on us. The desire to know the <em>
stedding</em> once more, to know our homes again. Many died of it.&rdquo;
Loial shook his head sadly. &ldquo;More died than lived. When we finally
began to find the <em>stedding</em> again, one at a time, in the
years of the Covenant of the Ten Nations, it seemed we had defeated
the Longing at last, but it had changed us, put seeds in us. Now,
if an Ogier is Outside too long, the Longing comes again; he begins
to weaken, and he dies if he does not return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you need to stay here awhile?&rdquo; Rand asked
anxiously. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to kill yourself to go with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will know it when it comes.&rdquo; Loial laughed. &ldquo;It
will be long before it is strong enough to cause harm to me. Why,
Dalar spent ten years among the Sea Folk without ever seeing a <em>
stedding</em>, and she came safely home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An Ogier woman appeared out of the trees, pausing a
moment to speak with Erith and Verin. She looked Ingtar up and down
and seemed to dismiss him, which made him blink. Her eyes swept
across Loial, flicked over Hurin and the Emond&rsquo;s Fielders, before
she went off into the forest again; Loial seemed to be trying to
hide behind his horse. &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; he said, peering cautiously
across his saddle after her, &ldquo;it is a dull life in the <em>
stedding</em> compared to traveling with three <em>
ta&rsquo;veren</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are going to start that again,&rdquo; Mat muttered,
and Loial spoke up quickly. &ldquo;Three friends, then. You are my
friends, I hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Rand said simply, and Perrin nodded.</p>

<p>Mat laughed. &ldquo;How could I not be friends with
somebody who dices so badly?&rdquo; He threw up his hands when Rand and
Perrin looked at him. &ldquo;Oh, all right. I like you, Loial. You&rsquo;re my
friend. Just don&rsquo;t go on about&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Aaah! Sometimes you&rsquo;re as bad
to be around as Rand.&rdquo; His voice sank to a mutter. &ldquo;At least we&rsquo;re
safe here in a <em>stedding</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand grimaced. He knew what Mat meant. <em>Here in a
</em>stedding, <em>where I can&rsquo;t channel</em>.</p>

<p>Perrin punched Mat&rsquo;s shoulder, but looked sorry that
he had when Mat grimaced at him with that gaunt face.</p>

<p>It was the music Rand became aware of first, unseen
flutes and fiddles in a jolly tune that floated through the trees,
and deep voices singing and laughing.</p>

<p class="verse_quote">&ldquo;Clear the field, smooth it low.<br>
Let no weed or stubble stand.<br>
Here we labor, here we toil,<br>
here the towering trees will grow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Almost at the same moment he realized that the huge
shape he was seeing through the trees was itself a tree, with a
ridged, buttressed trunk that must have been twenty paces thick.
Gaping, he followed it up with his eyes, up through the forest
canopy, to branches spreading like the top of a gigantic mushroom a
good hundred paces above the ground. And beyond it were taller
still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn me,&rdquo; Mat breathed. &ldquo;You could build ten houses
from just one of those. Fifty houses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cut down a Great Tree?&rdquo; Loial sounded scandalized,
and more than a little angry. His ears were stiff and still, his
long eyebrows down on his cheeks. &ldquo;We never cut down one of the
Great Trees, not unless it dies, and they almost never do. Few
survived the Breaking, but some of the largest were seedlings
during the Age of Legends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Mat said. &ldquo;I was just saying how big
they are. I won&rsquo;t hurt your trees.&rdquo; Loial nodded, seeming
mollified.</p>

<p>More Ogier appeared now, walking among the trees.
Most seemed intent on whatever they were about; though all looked
at the newcomers, and even gave a friendly nod or a small bow, none
stopped or spoke. They had a curious way of moving, in some manner
blending a careful deliberateness with an almost childlike carefree
joyfulness. They knew and liked who and what they were and where
they were, and they seemed at peace with themselves and everything
around them. Rand found himself envying them.</p>

<p>Few of the Ogier men were any taller than Loial, but
it was easy to pick out the older men; one and all they wore
mustaches as long as their dangling eyebrows and narrow beards
under their chins. All of the younger were smooth-shaven, like
Loial. Many of the men were in their shirtsleeves, and carried
shovels and mattocks or saws and buckets of pitch; the others wore
plain coats that buttoned to the neck and flared about their knees
like kilts. The women seemed to favor embroidered flowers, and many
wore flowers in their hair, too. The embroidery was limited to the
cloaks of the younger women; the older women&rsquo;s dresses were
embroidered, as well, and some women with gray hair had flowers and
vines from neck to hem. A handful of the Ogier, women and girls for
the most part, did seem to take special notice of Loial; he walked
staring straight ahead, ears twitching more wildly the further they
went.</p>

<p>Rand was startled to see an Ogier apparently walking
up out of the ground, out of one of the grassy, wildflower-covered
mounds that lay scattered all among the trees here. Then he saw
windows in the mounds, and an Ogier woman standing at one
apparently rolling a piecrust, and realized he was looking at Ogier
houses. The window frames were stone, but they not only seemed
natural formations, they appeared to have been sculpted by wind and
water over generations.</p>

<p>The Great Trees, with their massive trunks and
spreading roots as thick as horses, needed a great deal of room
between them, but several grew right in the town. Dirt ramps took
the paths over the roots. In fact, aside from the pathways, the
only way to tell town from forest at a glance was a large open
space in the center of the town, around what could only be the
stump of one of the Great Trees. Nearly a hundred paces across, its
surface was polished as smooth as any floor, and there were steps
built up to it at several places. Rand was imagining how tall that
tree had been when Erith spoke loudly enough for them all to
hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here come our other guests.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Three human women came walking around the side of the
huge stump. The youngest was carrying a wooden bowl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aiel,&rdquo; Ingtar said. &ldquo;Maidens of the Spear. As well I
<em>did</em> leave Masema with the others.&rdquo; Yet he stepped away
from Verin and Erith, and reached over his shoulder to loosen his
sword in its scabbard.</p>

<p>Rand studied the Aiel with an uneasy curiosity. They
were what too many people had tried to tell him he was. Two of the
women were mature, the other little more than a girl, but all three
were tall for women. Their short-cut hair ranged from a reddish
brown to almost golden, with a narrow, shoulder-length tail left
long at the back. They wore loose breeches tucked into soft boots,
and all their clothes were some shade of brown or gray or green; he
thought the garments would fade into rock or woods almost as well
as a Warder&rsquo;s cloak. Short bows poked over their shoulders, quivers
and long knives hung at their belts, and each carried a small,
round shield of hide and a cluster of spears with short shafts and
long points. Even the youngest moved with a grace that suggested
she knew how to use the weapons she carried.</p>

<p>Abruptly the women became aware of the other humans;
they seemed as startled at being startled as they did at the sight
of Rand and the others, but they moved like lightning. The youngest
one shouted, &ldquo;Shienarans!&rdquo; and turned to set the bowl carefully
behind her. The other two quickly lifted brown cloths from around
their shoulders, wrapping them around their heads instead. The
older women were raising black veils across their faces, hiding
everything but their eyes, and the youngest straightened to imitate
them. Crouching low, they advanced at a deliberate pace, shields
held forward with their clusters of spears, except for the one each
woman held ready in her other hand.</p>

<p>Ingtar&rsquo;s sword came out of its sheath. &ldquo;Stand clear,
Aes Sedai. Erith, stand clear.&rdquo; Hurin snatched out his
sword-breaker, wavered between cudgel and sword for his other hand;
after another glance at the Aiel&rsquo;s spears, he chose the sword.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not,&rdquo; the Ogier girl protested. Wringing
her hands, she turned from Ingtar to the Aiel and back. &ldquo;You must
not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand realized the heron-mark blade was in his hands.
Perrin had his axe half out of the loop at his belt and was
hesitating, shaking his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you two crazy?&rdquo; Mat demanded. His bow still
slanted across his back. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if they are Aiel, they&rsquo;re
women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop this!&rdquo; Verin demanded. &ldquo;Stop this immediately!&rdquo;
The Aiel never broke stride, and the Aes Sedai clenched her fists
in frustration.</p>

<p>Mat moved back to put a foot in his stirrup. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
leaving,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;You hear me? I&rsquo;m not staying to let them
stick those things in me, and I am not going to shoot a woman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Pact!&rdquo; Loial was shouting. &ldquo;Remember the Pact!&rdquo;
It had no more effect than the continued pleas from Verin and
Erith.</p>

<p>Rand noticed that both the Aes Sedai and the Ogier
girl were keeping well out of the Aiel&rsquo;s way. He wondered if Mat
had the right idea. He was not sure he could hurt a woman even if
she was trying to kill him. What decided him was the thought that
even if he did manage to reach Red&rsquo;s saddle, the Aiel were now no
more than thirty paces away. He suspected those short spears could
be thrown that far. As the women came closer, still crouching;
spears ready, he stopped worrying about not hurting them and began
worrying about how to stop them from hurting him.</p>

<p>Nervously, he sought the void, and it came. And the
distant thought floated outside it that it was only the void. The
glow of <em>saidin</em> was not there. The emptiness was more empty
than he ever remembered, vaster, like a hunger great enough to
consume him. A hunger for more; there was <em>supposed</em> to be
something more.</p>

<p>Abruptly an Ogier strode in between the two groups,
his narrow beard quivering. &ldquo;What is the meaning of this? Put up
your weapons.&rdquo; He sounded scandalized. &ldquo;For you&rdquo;&mdash;his glare
took in Ingtar and Hurin, Rand and Perrin, and did not spare Mat
for all his empty hands&mdash;&ldquo;there is some excuse, but for you&mdash;&rdquo; He rounded on the Aiel women, who had stopped their
advance. &ldquo;Have you forgotten the Pact?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The women uncovered their heads and faces so hastily
that it seemed they were trying to pretend they had never been
covered. The girl&rsquo;s face was bright red, and the other women looked
abashed. One of the older women, the one with the reddish hair,
said, &ldquo;Forgive us, Treebrother. We remember the Pact, and we would
not have bared steel, but we are in the land of the Treekillers,
where every hand is against us, and we saw armed men.&rdquo; Her eyes
were gray, Rand saw, like his own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are in a <em>stedding</em>, Rhian,&rdquo; the Ogier
said gently. &ldquo;Everyone is safe in the <em>stedding</em>, little
sister. There is no fighting here, and no hand raised against
another.&rdquo; She nodded, ashamed, and the Ogier looked at Ingtar and
the others.</p>

<p>Ingtar sheathed his sword, and Rand did the same,
though not so quickly as Hurin, who looked almost as embarrassed as
the Aiel. Perrin had never gotten his axe all the way out. As he
took hand from hilt, Rand let the void go, too, and shivered. The
void went, but it left behind a slowly fading echo of the emptiness
all through him, and a desire for something to fill it.</p>

<p>The Ogier turned to Verin and bowed. &ldquo;Aes Sedai, I am
Juin, son of Lacel son of Laud. I have come to take you to the
Elders. They would know why an Aes Sedai comes among us, with armed
men and one of our own youths.&rdquo; Loial hunched his shoulders as if
trying to disappear.</p>

<p>Verin gave the Aiel a regretful look, as if she
wanted to talk with them, then motioned Juin to lead, and he took
her away without another word or even the first look at Loial.</p>

<p>For a few moments, Rand and the others stood facing
the three Aiel women uneasily. At least, Rand knew he was uneasy.
Ingtar seemed steady as a stone, with no more expression than one.
The Aiel might have unveiled their faces, but they still had spears
in their hands, and they studied the four men as though trying to
see inside them. Rand in particular received increasingly angry
looks. He heard the youngest woman mutter, &ldquo;He is wearing a sword,&rdquo;
in tones of mingled horror and contempt. Then the three were
leaving, stopping to retrieve the wooden bowl and looking over
their shoulders at Rand and the others until they vanished among
the trees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maidens of the Spear,&rdquo; Ingtar muttered. &ldquo;I never
thought they&rsquo;d stop once they veiled their faces. Certainly not for
a few words.&rdquo; He looked at Rand and his two friends. &ldquo;You should
see a charge by Red Shields, or Stone Dogs. As easy to stop as
an avalanche.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They would not break the Pact once it was recalled
to them,&rdquo; Erith said, smiling. &ldquo;They came for sung wood.&rdquo; A note of
pride entered her voice. &ldquo;We have two Treesingers in Stedding
Tsofu. They are rare, now. I have heard that Stedding Shangtai has
a young Treesinger who is very talented, but we have two.&rdquo; Loial
blushed, but she did not appear to notice. &ldquo;If you will come with
me, I will show you where you may wait until the Elders have
spoken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As they followed her, Perrin murmured, &ldquo;Sung wood, my
left foot. Those Aiel are searching for He Who Comes With the
Dawn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Mat added dryly, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re looking for you,
Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For me! That is crazy. What makes you think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He cut off as Erith showed them down the steps of a
wildflower-covered house apparently set aside for human guests. The
rooms were twenty paces from stone wall to stone wall, with painted
ceilings a good two spans above the floor, but the Ogier had done
their best making something that would be comfortable for humans.
Even so, the furniture was a little too large for comfort, the
chairs tall enough to lift a man&rsquo;s heels off the floor, the table
higher than Rand&rsquo;s waist. Hurin, at least, could have walked erect
into the stone fireplace, which seemed to have been worn by water
rather than made by hands. Erith eyed Loial doubtfully, but he
waved away her concern and pulled one of the chairs into the corner
least easily seen from the door.</p>

<p>As soon as the Ogier girl left, Rand got Mat and
Perrin over to one side. &ldquo;What do you mean they&rsquo;re looking for me?
Why? For what reason? They looked right at me, and went away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They looked at you,&rdquo; Mat said with a grin, &ldquo;like you
hadn&rsquo;t bathed in a month, and had doused yourself with sheepdip
besides.&rdquo; His grin faded. &ldquo;But they could be looking for you. We
met another Aiel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand listened in growing amazement to their tale of
the meeting in Kinslayer&rsquo;s Dagger. Mat told most of it, with Perrin
putting in a correcting word now and again when he embellished too
much. Mat made a great show of how dangerous the Aielman had been,
and how close the meeting had come to a fight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And since you&rsquo;re the only Aiel we know,&rdquo; he
finished, &ldquo;well, it could be you. Ingtar says Aiel never live
outside the Waste, so you must be the only one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s funny, Mat,&rdquo; Rand growled. &ldquo;I
am not an Aiel.&rdquo; <em>The Amyrlin said you are. Ingtar thinks you
are. Tam said</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>He was sick, fevered</em>. They had
severed the roots he had thought he had, the Aes Sedai and Tam
between them, though Tam had been too sick to know what he was
saying. They had cut him loose to tumble before the wind, then
offered him something new to hold on to. False Dragon. Aiel. He
could not claim those for roots. He would not. &ldquo;Maybe I don&rsquo;t
belong to anyone. But the Two Rivers is the only home I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean anything,&rdquo; Mat protested. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Burn me, Ingtar says you are. Masema says you are. Urien could
have been your cousin, and if Rhian put on a dress and said she was
your aunt, you&rsquo;d believe it yourself. Oh, all right. Don&rsquo;t look at
me like that, Perrin. If he wants to say he isn&rsquo;t, all right. What
difference does it make, anyway?&rdquo; Perrin shook his head.</p>

<p>Ogier girls brought water and towels for washing
faces and hands, and cheese and fruit and wine, with pewter goblets
a little too large to be comfortable in the hand. Other Ogier women
came, too, their dresses all embroidered. One by one they appeared,
a dozen of them all told, to ask if the humans were comfortable, if
they needed anything. Each turned her attentions to Loial just
before she left. He gave his answers respectfully but in as few
words as Rand had ever heard him use, standing with an Ogier-sized,
wood-bound book clutched to his chest like a shield, and when they
went, he huddled in his chair with the book held up in front of his
face. The books in the house were one thing not sized for
humans.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just smell this air, Lord Rand,&rdquo; Hurin said, filling
his lungs with a smile. His feet dangled from one of the chairs at
the table; he swung them like a boy. &ldquo;I never thought most places
smelled bad, but this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Lord Rand, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s <em>
ever</em> been any killing here. Not even any hurting, except by
accident.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <em>stedding</em> are supposed to be safe for
everyone,&rdquo; Rand said. He was watching Loial. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the
stories say, anyway.&rdquo; He swallowed a last bit of white cheese and
went over to the Ogier. Mat followed with a goblet in his hand.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Loial?&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been as nervous as a
cat in a dogyard ever since we came here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is nothing,&rdquo; Loial said, giving the door an
uneasy glance from. the corner of his eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you afraid they&rsquo;ll find out you left Stedding
Shangtai without permission from your Elders?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial looked around wildly, the tufts on his ears
vibrating. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; he hissed. &ldquo;Not where anyone can hear.
If they found out&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; With a heavy sigh, he slumped back,
looking from Rand to Mat. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how humans do it, but among
Ogier&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;If a girl sees a boy she likes, she goes to her mother.
Or sometimes the mother sees someone she thinks is suitable. In any
case, if they agree, the girl&rsquo;s mother goes to the boy&rsquo;s mother,
and the next thing the boy knows, his marriage is all
arranged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t the boy have any say in it?&rdquo; Mat asked
incredulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None. The women always say we would spend our lives
married to the trees if it was left to us.&rdquo; Loial shifted,
grimacing. &ldquo;Half of our marriages take place between <em>
stedding</em>; groups of young Ogier visit from <em>stedding</em>
to <em>stedding</em> so they can see, and be seen. If they discover
I&rsquo;m Outside without permission, the Elders will almost certainly
decide I need a wife to settle me down. Before I know it, they&rsquo;ll
have sent a message to Stedding Shangtai, to my mother, and she
will come here and have me married before she washes off the dust
of her journey. She&rsquo;s always said I am too hasty and need a wife. I
think she was looking when I left. Whatever wife she chooses for me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well, any wife at all won&rsquo;t let me go back Outside until I
have gray in my beard. Wives always say no man should be allowed
Outside until he&rsquo;s settled enough to control his temper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat gave a guffaw loud enough to draw every head, but
at Loial&rsquo;s frantic gesture he spoke softly. &ldquo;Among us, men do the
choosing, and no wife can stop a man doing what he wants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand frowned, remembering how Egwene had begun
following him around when they were both little. It was then that
Mistress al&rsquo;Vere had begun taking a special interest in him, more
than in any of the other boys. Later, some girls would dance with
him on feastdays and some would not, and those who would were
always Egwene&rsquo;s friends, while those who would not were girls
Egwene did not like. He also seemed to remember Mistress al&rsquo;Vere
taking Tam aside&mdash;<em>And she was muttering about Tam not
having a wife for her to talk to!</em>&mdash;and after that, Tam
and everyone else had acted as if he and Egwene were promised, even
though they had not knelt before the Women&rsquo;s Circle to say the
words. He had never thought about it this way before; things
between Egwene and him had always just seemed to be the way they
were, and that was that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we do it the same way,&rdquo; he muttered, and
when Mat laughed, he added, &ldquo;Do you remember your father ever doing
anything your mother really didn&rsquo;t want him to?&rdquo; Mat opened his
mouth with a grin, then frowned thoughtfully and closed it
again.</p>

<p>Juin came down the steps from outside. &ldquo;If you
please, will all of you come with me? The Elders would see you.&rdquo; He
did not look at Loial, but Loial still almost dropped the book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the Elders try to make you stay,&rdquo; Rand said,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll say we need you to go with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet it isn&rsquo;t about you at all,&rdquo; Mat said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
bet they are just going to say we can use the Waygate.&rdquo; He shook
himself, and his voice fell even lower. &ldquo;We really have to do it,
don&rsquo;t we.&rdquo; It was not a question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay and get married, or travel the Ways.&rdquo; Loial
grimaced ruefully. &ldquo;Life is very unsettling with <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>
for friends.&rdquo;</p>
