ship and horse the stories spread, by merchant
wagon and man on foot, told and retold, changing yet always alike
at the heart, to Arad Doman and Tarabon and beyond, of signs and
portents in the sky above Falme. And men proclaimed themselves for
the Dragon, and other men struck them down and were struck down in
turn.</p>

<p>Other tales spread, of a column that rode from the
sinking sun across Almoth Plain. A hundred Bordermen, it was said.
No, a thousand. No, a thousand heroes come back from the grave to
answer the call of the Horn of Valere. Ten thousand. They had
destroyed a legion of the Children of the Light entire. They had
thrown Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s returned armies back into the sea. They
were Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s armies returned. Toward the mountains they
rode, toward the dawn.</p>

<p>Yet one thing every tale had the same. At their head
rode a man whose face had been seen in the sky above Falme, and
they rode under the banner of the Dragon Reborn.</p>

<p class="prophecy">And men cried out to the Creator, praying, O Light of the
Heavens, Light of the World, let the Promised One be born of the
mountain, according to the Prophecies, as he was in Ages past and
will be in Ages to come. Let the Prince of the Morning sing to the
land that green things will grow and the valleys give forth lambs.
Let the arm of the Lord of the Dawn shelter us from the Dark, and
the great sword of justice defend us. Let the Dragon ride again on
the winds of time.</p>
