<h4><em>The Welcome</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
halls of Fal Dara keep, their smooth stone walls
sparsely decorated with elegantly simple tapestries and painted
screens, bustled with news of the Amyrlin Seat&rsquo;s imminent arrival.
Servants in black-and-gold darted about their tasks, running to
prepare rooms or carry orders to the kitchens, moaning that they
could not have everything ready for so great a personage when they
had had no warning. Dark-eyed warriors, their heads shaven except
for a topknot bound with a leather cord, did not run, but haste
filled their steps and their faces shone with an excitement
normally reserved for battle. Some of the men spoke as Rand hurried
past.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, there you are, Rand al&rsquo;Thor. Peace favor your
sword. On your way to clean up? You&rsquo;ll want to look your best when
you are presented to the Amyrlin Seat. She&rsquo;ll want to see you and
your two friends as well as the women, you can count on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He trotted toward the broad stairs, wide enough for
twenty men abreast, that led up to the men&rsquo;s apartments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Amyrlin herself, come with no more warning than
a pack peddler. Must be because of Moiraine Sedai and you
southerners, eh? What else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wide, iron-bound doors of the men&rsquo;s apartments
stood open, and half jammed with top-knotted men buzzing with the
Amyrlin&rsquo;s arrival.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho, southlander! The Amyrlin&rsquo;s here. Come for you
and your friends, I suppose. Peace, what honor for you! She seldom
leaves Tar Valon, and she&rsquo;s never come to the Borderlands in my
memory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He fended them all off with a few words. He had to
wash. Find a clean shirt. No time to talk. They thought they
understood, and let him go. Not a one of them knew a thing except
that he and his friends traveled in company with an Aes Sedai, that
two of his friends were women who were going to Tar Valon to train
as Aes Sedai, but their words stabbed at him as if they knew
everything. <em>She&rsquo;s come for me</em>.</p>

<p>He dashed through the men&rsquo;s apartments, darted into
the room he shared with Mat and Perrin&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and froze, his jaw
dropping in astonishment. The room was filled with women wearing
the black-and-gold, all working purposefully. It was not a big
room, and its windows, a pair of tall, narrow arrowslits looking
down on one of the inner courtyards, did nothing to make it seem
larger. Three beds on black-and-white tiled platforms, each with a
chest at the foot, three plain chairs, a washstand by the door, and
a tall, wide wardrobe crowded the room. The eight women in there
seemed like fish in a basket.</p>

<p>The women barely glanced at him, and went right on
clearing his clothes&mdash;and Mat&rsquo;s and Perrin&rsquo;s&mdash;out of the
wardrobe and replacing them with new. Anything found in the pockets
was put atop the chests, and the old clothes were bundled up
carelessly, like rags.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; he demanded when he caught his
breath. &ldquo;Those are my clothes!&rdquo; One of the women sniffed and poked
a finger through a tear in the sleeve of his only coat, then added
it to the pile on the floor.</p>

<p>Another, a black-haired woman with a big ring of keys
at her waist, set her eyes on him. That was Elansu,
<em>shatayan</em> of the keep. He thought of the sharp-faced woman
as a housekeeper, though the house she kept was a fortress and
scores of servants did her bidding. &ldquo;Moiraine Sedai said all of
your clothes are worn out, and the Lady Amalisa had new made to
give you. Just keep out of our way,&rdquo; she added firmly, &ldquo;and we will
be done the quicker.&rdquo; There were few men the <em>shatayan</em>
could not bully into doing as she wished&mdash;some said even Lord
Agelmar&mdash;and she plainly did not expect any trouble with one
man young enough to be her son.</p>

<p>He swallowed what he had been going to say; there was
no time for arguing. The Amyrlin Seat could be sending for him at
any minute. &ldquo;Honor to the Lady Amalisa for her gift,&rdquo; he managed,
after the Shienaran way, &ldquo;and honor to you, Elansu Shatayan.
Please, convey my words to the Lady Amalisa, and tell her I said,
heart and soul to serve.&rdquo; That ought to satisfy the Shienaran love
of ceremony for both women. &ldquo;But now if you&rsquo;ll pardon me, I want to
change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is well,&rdquo; Elansu said comfortably. &ldquo;Moiraine
Sedai said to remove all the old. Every stitch. Smallclothes, too.&rdquo;
Several of the women eyed him sideways. None of them made a move
toward the door.</p>

<p>He bit his cheek to keep from laughing hysterically.
Many ways were different in Shienar from what he was used to, and
there were some to which he would never become accustomed if he
lived forever. He had taken to bathing in the small hours of the
morning, when the big, tiled pools were empty of people, after he
discovered that at any other time a woman might well climb into the
water with him. It could be a scullion or the Lady Amalisa, Lord
Agelmar&rsquo;s sister herself&mdash;the baths were one place in Shienar
where there was no rank&mdash;expecting him to scrub her back in
return for the same favor, asking him why his face was so red, had
he taken too much sun? They had soon learned to recognize his
blushes for what they were, and not a woman in the keep but seemed
fascinated by them.</p>

<p><em>I might be dead or worse in another hour, and
they&rsquo;re waiting to see me blush!</em> He cleared his throat. &ldquo;If
you&rsquo;ll wait outside, I will pass the rest out to you. On my
honor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the women gave a soft chortle, and even
Elansu&rsquo;s lips twitched, but the <em>shatayan</em> nodded and
directed the other women to gather up the bundles they had made.
She was the last to leave, and she paused in the doorway to add,
&ldquo;The boots, too. Moiraine Sedai said everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He opened his mouth, then closed it again. His boots,
at least, were certainly still good, made by Alwyn al&rsquo;Van, the
cobbler back in Emond&rsquo;s Field, and well broken in and comfortable.
But if giving up his boots would make the <em>shatayan</em> leave
him alone so he could go, he would give her the boots, and anything
else she wanted. He had no time. &ldquo;Yes. Yes, of course. On my
honor.&rdquo; He pushed on the door, forcing her out.</p>

<p>Alone, he dropped onto his bed to tug off his
boots&mdash;they were still good, a little worn, the leather cracked here
and there, but still wearable and well broken-in to fit his
feet&mdash;then hastily stripped off, piling everything atop the boots,
and washed at the basin just as quickly. The water was cold; the
water was always cold in the men&rsquo;s apartments.</p>

<p>The wardrobe had three wide doors carved in the
simple Shienaran manner, suggesting more than showing a series of
waterfalls and rocky pools. Pulling open the center door, he stared
for a moment at what had replaced the few garments he had brought
with him. A dozen high-collared coats of the finest wool and as
well cut as any he had ever seen on a merchant&rsquo;s back or a lord&rsquo;s,
most embroidered like feastday clothes. A dozen! Three shirts for
every coat, both linen and silk, with wide sleeves and tight cuffs.
Two cloaks. Two, when he had made do with one at a time all his
life. One cloak was plain, stout wool and dark green, the other
deep blue with a stiff standing collar embroidered in gold with
herons&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and high on the left breast, where a lord would wear
his sign&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His hand drifted to the cloak of its own accord. As
if uncertain what they would feel, his fingers brushed the
stitching of a serpent curled almost into a circle, but a serpent
with four legs and a lion&rsquo;s golden mane, scaled in crimson and
gold, its feet each tipped with five golden claws. His hand jerked
back as if burned. <em>Light help me! Was it Amalisa had this made,
or Moiraine? How many saw it? How many know what it is, what it
means? Even one is too many. Burn me, she&rsquo;s trying to get me
killed. Bloody Moiraine won&rsquo;t even talk to me, but now she&rsquo;s given
me bloody fine new clothes to die in!</em></p>

<p>A rap at the door sent him leaping half out of his
skin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you done?&rdquo; came Elansu&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Every stitch,
now. Perhaps I had better&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; A creak as if she were trying the
knob.</p>

<p>With a start Rand realized he was still naked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
done,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Peace! Don&rsquo;t come in!&rdquo; Hurriedly he gathered up
what he had been wearing, boots and all. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring them!&rdquo; Hiding
behind the door, he opened it just wide enough to shove the bundle
into the arms of the <em>shatayan</em>. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She tried to peer through the gap. &ldquo;Are you sure?
Moiraine Sedai said everything. Perhaps I had better just look&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s everything,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;On my honor!&rdquo; He
shouldered the door shut in her face, and heard laughter from the
other side.</p>

<p>Muttering under his breath, he dressed hurriedly. He
would not put it past any of them to find some excuse to come
bulling in anyway. The gray breeches were snugger than he was used
to, but still comfortable, and the shirt, with its billowy sleeves,
was white enough to satisfy any goodwife in Emond&rsquo;s Field on
laundry day. The knee-high boots fit as if he had worn them a year.
He hoped it was just a good cobbler, and not more Aes Sedai
work.</p>

<p>All of these clothes would make a pack as big as he
was. Yet, he had grown used to the comfort of clean shirts again,
of not wearing the same breeches day after day until sweat and dirt
made them as stiff as his boots, then wearing them still. He took
his saddlebags from his chest and stuffed what he could into them,
then reluctantly spread the fancy cloak out on the bed and piled a
few more shirts and breeches on that. Folded with the dangerous
sigil inside and tied with a cord looped so it could be slung on a
shoulder, it looked not much different from the packs he had seen
carried by other young men on the road.</p>

<p>A peal of trumpets rolled through the arrowslits,
trumpets calling the fanfare from outside the walls, trumpets
answering from the keep towers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pick out the stitching when I get a chance,&rdquo; he
muttered. He had seen women picking out embroidery when they had
made a mistake or changed their mind on the pattern, and it did not
look very hard.</p>

<p>The rest of the clothes&mdash;most of them, in fact&mdash;he stuffed back into the wardrobe. No need to leave evidence
of flight to be found by the first person to poke a head in after
he went.</p>

<p>Still frowning, he knelt beside his bed. The tiled
platforms on which the beds rested were stoves, where a small fire
damped down to burn all night could keep the bed warm through the
worst night in a Shienaran winter. The nights were still cooler
than he was used to this time of year, but blankets were enough for
warmth now. Pulling open the firebox door, he took out a bundle he
could not leave behind. He was glad Elansu had not thought anyone
would keep clothes in there.</p>

<p>Setting the bundle atop the blankets, he untied one
end and partially unfolded it. A gleeman&rsquo;s cloak, turned inside out
to hide the hundreds of patches that covered it, patches in every
size and color imaginable. The cloak itself was sound enough; the
patches were a gleeman&rsquo;s badge. Had been a gleeman&rsquo;s badge.</p>

<p>Inside nestled two hard leather cases. The larger
held a harp, which he never touched. <em>The harp was never meant
for a farmer&rsquo;s clumsy fingers, boy</em>. The other, long and slim,
contained the gold-and-silver chased flute he had used to earn his
supper and bed more than once since leaving home. Thom Merrilin had
taught him to play that flute, before the gleeman died. Rand could
never touch it without remembering Thom, with his sharp blue eyes
and his long white mustaches, shoving the bundled cloak into his
hands and shouting for him to run. And then Thom had run himself,
knives appearing magically in his hands as if he were performing,
to face the Myrddraal that was coming to kill them.</p>

<p>With a shiver, he redid the bundle. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all over
with.&rdquo; Thinking of the wind on the tower top, he added, &ldquo;Strange
things happen this close to the Blight.&rdquo; He was not sure he
believed it, not the way Lan had apparently meant it. In any case,
even without the Amyrlin Seat, it was past time for him to be gone
from Fal Dara.</p>

<p>Shrugging into the coat he had kept out&mdash;it was
a deep, dark green, and made him think of the forests at home,
Tam&rsquo;s Westwood farm where he had grown up, and the Waterwood where
he had learned to swim&mdash;he buckled the heron-mark sword to
his waist and hung his quiver, bristling with arrows, on the other
side. His unstrung bow stood propped in the corner with Mat&rsquo;s and
Perrin&rsquo;s, the stave two hands taller than he was. He had made it
himself since coming to Fal Dara, and besides him, only Lan and
Perrin could draw it. Stuffing his blanketroll and his new cloak
through the loops on his bundles, he slung the pair from his left
shoulder, tossed his saddlebags atop the cords, and grabbed the
bow. <em>Leave the sword-arm free</em>, he thought. <em>Make them
think I&rsquo;m dangerous. Maybe</em> somebody <em>will</em>.</p>

<p>Cracking the door revealed the hall all but empty;
one liveried servant dashed by, but he never so much as glanced at
Rand. As soon as the man&rsquo;s rapid footfalls faded, Rand slipped out
into the corridor.</p>

<p>He tried to walk naturally, casually, but with
saddlebags on his shoulder and bundles on his back, he knew he
looked like what he was, a man setting out on a journey and not
meaning to come back. The trumpets called again, sounding fainter
here inside the keep.</p>

<p>He had a horse, a tall bay stallion, in the north
stable, called the Lord&rsquo;s Stable, close by the salley gate that
Lord Agelmar used when he went riding. Neither the Lord of Fal Dara
nor any of his family would be riding today, though, and the stable
might be empty except for the stableboys. There were two ways to
reach the Lord&rsquo;s Stable from Rand&rsquo;s room. One would take him all
the way around the keep, behind Lord Agelmar&rsquo;s private garden, then
down the far side and through the farrier&rsquo;s smithy, likewise
certainly empty now, to the stableyard. Time enough that way for
orders to be given, for a search to start, before he reached his
horse. The other was far shorter; first across the outer courtyard,
where even now the Amyrlin Seat was arriving with another dozen or
more Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>His skin prickled at the thought; he had had more
than enough of Aes Sedai for any sane lifetime. One was too many.
All the stories said it, and he knew it for fact. But he was not
surprised when his feet took him toward the outer courtyard. He
would never see legendary Tar Valon&mdash;he could not afford that
risk, now or ever&mdash;but he might catch a glimpse of the
Amyrlin Seat before he left. That would be as much as seeing a
queen. <em>There can&rsquo;t he anything dangerous in just looking, from
a distance. I&rsquo;ll keep moving and he gone before she ever knows I
was there</em>.</p>

<p>He opened a heavy, iron-strapped door onto the outer
courtyard and stepped out into silence. People forested the
guardwalk atop every wall, top-knotted soldiers, and liveried
servants, and menials still in their muck, all pressed together
cheek by jowl, with children sitting on shoulders to look over
their elders&rsquo; heads or squeezing in to peer around waists and
knees. Every archers&rsquo; balcony was packed like a barrel of apples,
and faces even showed in the narrow arrowslits in the walls. A
thick mass of people bordered the courtyard like another wall. And
all of them watched and waited in silence.</p>

<p>He pushed his way along the wall, in front of the
smithies and fletchers&rsquo; stalls that lined the court&mdash;Fal Dara
was a fortress, not a palace, despite its size and grim grandeur,
and everything about it served that end&mdash;apologizing quietly
to the people he jostled. Some looked around with a frown, and a
few gave a second stare to his saddlebags and bundles, but none
broke the silence. Most did not even bother to look at who had
bumped past them.</p>

<p>He could easily see over the heads of most of them,
enough to make out clearly what was going on in the courtyard. Just
inside the main gate, a line of men stood beside their horses,
sixteen of them. No two wore the same kind of armor or carried the
same sort of sword, and none looked like Lan, but Rand did not
doubt they were Warders. Round faces, square faces, long faces,
narrow faces, they all had the look, as if they saw things other
men did not see, heard things other men did not hear. Standing at
their ease, they looked as deadly as a pack of wolves. Only one
other thing about them was alike. One and all they wore the
color-shifting cloak he had first seen on Lan, the cloak that often
seemed to fade into whatever was behind it. It did not make for
easy watching or a still stomach, so many men in those cloaks.</p>

<p>A dozen paces in front of the Warders, a row of women
stood by their horses&rsquo; heads, the cowls of their cloaks thrown
back. He could count them, now. Fourteen. Fourteen Aes Sedai. They
must be. Tall and short, slender and plump, dark and fair, hair cut
short or long, hanging loose down their backs or braided, their
clothes were as different as the Warders&rsquo; were, in as many cuts and
colors as there were women. Yet they, too, had a sameness, one that
was only obvious when they stood together like this. To a woman,
they seemed ageless. From this distance he would have called them
all young, but closer he knew they would be like Moiraine.
Young-seeming yet not, smooth-skinned but with faces too mature for
youth, eyes too knowing.</p>

<p><em>Closer? Fool! I&rsquo;m too close already! Burn me, I
should have gone the long way</em>. He pressed on toward his goal,
another iron-bound door at the far end of the court, but he could
not stop looking.</p>

<p>Calmly the Aes Sedai ignored the onlookers and kept
their attention on the curtained palanquin, now in the center of
the courtyard. The horses bearing it held as still as if ostlers
stood at their harness, but there was only one tall woman beside
the palanquin, her face an Aes Sedai&rsquo;s face, and she paid no mind
to the horses. The staff she held upright before her with both
hands was as tall as she, the gilded flame capping it standing
above her eyes.</p>

<p>Lord Agelmar faced the palanquin from the far end of
the court, bluff and square and face unreadable. His high-collared
coat of dark blue bore the three running red foxes of the House
Jagad as well as the stooping black hawk of Shienar. Beside him
stood Ronan, age-withered but still tall; three foxes carved from
red avatine topped the tall staff the <em>shambayan</em> bore.
Ronan was Elansu&rsquo;s equal in ordering the keep, <em>shambayan</em>
and <em>shatayan</em>, but Elansu left little for him except
ceremonies and acting as Lord Agelmar&rsquo;s secretary. Both men&rsquo;s
topknots were snow-white.</p>

<p>All of them&mdash;the Warders, the Aes Sedai, the Lord
of Fal Dara, and his <em>shambayan</em>&mdash;stood as still as
stone. The watching crowd seemed to hold its breath. Despite
himself, Rand slowed.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ronan rapped his staff loudly three times on
the broad paving stones, calling into the silence, &ldquo;Who comes here?
Who comes here? Who comes here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman beside the palanquin tapped her staff three
times in reply. &ldquo;The Watcher of the Seals. The Flame of Tar Valon.
The Amyrlin Seat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should we watch?&rdquo; Ronan demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the hope of humankind,&rdquo; the tall woman
replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Against what do we guard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The shadow at noon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long shall we guard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From rising sun to rising sun, so long as the Wheel
of Time turns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Agelmar bowed, his white topknot stirring in the
breeze. &ldquo;Fal Dara offers bread and salt and welcome. Welcome is
the Amyrlin Seat to Fal Dara, for here is the watch kept, here is
the Pact maintained. Welcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tall woman drew back the curtain of the
palanquin, and the Amyrlin Seat stepped out. Dark-haired, ageless
as all Aes Sedai were ageless, she ran her eyes over the assembled
watchers as she straightened. Rand flinched when her gaze crossed
him; he felt as if he had been touched. But her eyes passed on and
came to rest on Lord Agelmar. A liveried servant knelt at her side
with folded towels, steam still rising, on a silver tray. Formally,
she wiped her hands and patted her face with a damp cloth. &ldquo;I offer
thanks for your welcome, my son. May the Light illumine House
Jagad. May the Light illumine Fal Dara and all her people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Agelmar bowed again. &ldquo;You honor us, Mother.&rdquo; It did
not sound odd, her calling him son or him calling her Mother,
though comparing her smooth cheeks to his craggy face made him seem
more like her father, or even grandfather. She had a presence that
more than matched his. &ldquo;House Jagad is yours. Fal Dara is
yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cheers rose on every side, crashing against the walls
of the keep like breaking waves.</p>

<p>Shivering, Rand hurried toward the door to safety,
careless of whom he bumped into now. <em>Just your bloody
imagination. She doesn&rsquo;t even know who you are. Not yet. Blood and
ashes, if she did</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He did not want to think of what would
have happened if she knew who he was, what he was. What would
happen when she finally found out. He wondered if she had had
anything to do with the wind atop the tower; Aes Sedai could do
things like that. When he pushed through that door and slammed it
shut behind him, muting the roar of welcome that still shook the
courtyard, he heaved a relieved sigh.</p>

<p>The halls here were as empty as the others had been,
and he all but ran. Out across a smaller courtyard, with a fountain
splashing in the center, down yet another corridor and out into the
flagstoned stableyard. The Lord&rsquo;s Stable itself, built into the
wall of the keep, stood tall and long, with big windows here inside
the walls, and horses kept on two floors. The smithy across the
courtyard stood silent, the farrier and his helpers gone to see the
Welcome.</p>

<p>Tema, the leathery-faced head groom, met him at the
wide doors with a deep bow, touching his forehead and then his
heart. &ldquo;Spirit and heart to serve, my Lord. How may Tema serve, my
Lord?&rdquo; No warrior&rsquo;s topknot here; Tema&rsquo;s hair sat on his head like
an inverted gray bowl.</p>

<p>Rand sighed. &ldquo;For the hundredth time, Tema, I am not
a lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As my Lord wishes.&rdquo; The groom&rsquo;s bow was even lower
this time.</p>

<p>It was his name that caused the problem, and a
similarity. Rand al&rsquo;Thor. Al&rsquo;Lan Mandragoran. For Lan, according to
the custom of Malkier, the royal &ldquo;al&rdquo; named him King, though he
never used it himself. For Rand, &ldquo;al&rdquo; was just a part of his name,
though he had heard that once, long ago, before the Two Rivers was
called the Two Rivers, it had meant &ldquo;son of.&rdquo; Some of the servants
in Fal Dara keep, though, had taken it to mean he was a king, too,
or at least a prince. All of his argument to the contrary had only
managed to demote him to lord. At least, he thought it had; he had
never seen quite so much bowing and scraping, even with Lord
Agelmar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I need Red saddled, Tema.&rdquo; He knew better than to
offer to do it himself; Tema would not let Rand soil his hands. &ldquo;I
thought I&rsquo;d spend a few days seeing the country around the town.&rdquo;
Once he was on the big bay stallion&rsquo;s back, a few days would see
him at the River Erinin, or across the border into Arafel.
<em>They&rsquo;ll never find me then</em>.</p>

<p>The groom bent himself almost double, and stayed
bent. &ldquo;Forgive, my Lord,&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely. &ldquo;Forgive, but Tema
cannot obey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flushing with embarrassment, Rand took an anxious
look around&mdash;there was no one else in sight&mdash;then
grabbed the man&rsquo;s shoulder and pulled him upright. He might not be
able to stop Tema and a few others from acting like this, but he
could try to stop anyone else from seeing it. &ldquo;Why not, Tema? Tema,
look at me, please. Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is commanded, my Lord,&rdquo; Tema said, still
whispering. He kept dropping his eyes, not afraid, but ashamed that
he could not do what Rand asked. Shienarans took shame the way
other people took being branded a thief. &ldquo;No horse may leave this
stable until the order is changed. Nor any stable in the keep, my
Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand had his mouth open to tell the man it was all
right, but instead he licked his lips. &ldquo;No horse from any
stable?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my Lord. The order came down only a short time
ago. Only moments.&rdquo; Tema&rsquo;s voice picked up strength. &ldquo;All the gates
are closed as well, my Lord. None may enter or leave without
permission. Not even the city patrol, so Tema has been told.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand swallowed hard, but it did not lessen the
feeling of fingers clutching his windpipe. &ldquo;The order, Tema. It
came from Lord Agelmar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, my Lord. Who else? Lord Agelmar did not
speak the command to Tema, of course, nor even to the man who did
speak to Tema, but, my Lord, who else could give such a command in
Fal Dara?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Who else?</em> Rand jumped as the biggest bell in
the keep bell tower let out a sonorous peal. The other bells joined
in, then bells from the town.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Tema may be bold,&rdquo; the groom called above the
reverberations, &ldquo;my Lord must be very happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand had to shout back to be heard. &ldquo;Happy? Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Welcome is finished, my Lord.&rdquo; Tema&rsquo;s gesture
took in the bell tower. &ldquo;The Amyrlin Seat will be sending for my
Lord, and my Lord&rsquo;s friends, to come to her, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand broke into a run. He just had time to see the
surprise on Tema&rsquo;s face, and then he was gone. He did not care what
Tema thought. <em>She will he sending for me now</em>.</p>
