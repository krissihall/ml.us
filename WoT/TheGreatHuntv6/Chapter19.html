<h4><em>Beneath the Dagger</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">N</span>ight
on the edge of Kinslayer&rsquo;s Dagger was cold, as
nights in the mountains are always cold. The wind whipped down from
the high peaks carrying the iciness of the snowcaps. Rand shifted
on the hard ground, tugging at his cloak and blanket, and only half
asleep. His hand went to his sword, lying beside him. <em>One more
day</em>, he thought drowsily. <em>Just one more, and then we go.
If no one comes tomorrow, Ingtar or Darkfriends one, I&rsquo;ll take
Selene to Cairhien</em>.</p>

<p>He had told himself that before. Every day they had
been there on the mountainside, watching the place where Hurin said
the trail had been, in that other world&mdash;where Selene said
the Darkfriends would surely appear in this world&mdash;he told
himself it was time to leave. And Selene talked of the Horn of
Valere, and touched his arm, and looked into his eyes, and before
he knew it he had agreed to yet another day before they went
on.</p>

<p>He shrugged against the chill of the wind, thinking
of Selene touching his arm and looking into his eyes. <em>If Egwene
saw that, she&rsquo;d shear me for a sheep, and Selene, too. Egwene could
already be in Tar Valon by now, learning to be an Aes Sedai. The
next time she sees me, she&rsquo;ll probably try to gentle me</em>.</p>

<p>As he shifted over, his hand slid past the sword and
touched the bundle holding Thom Merrilin&rsquo;s harp and flute.
Unconsciously, his fingers tightened on the gleeman&rsquo;s cloak. <em>I
was happy then, I think, even running for my life. Playing the
flute for my supper. I was too ignorant to know what was going on.
There&rsquo;s no turning back</em>.</p>

<p>Shivering, he opened his eyes. The only light came
from the waning moon, not far past full and low in the sky. A fire
would give them away to those for whom they watched. Loial muttered
in his sleep, a low rumble. One of the horses stamped a hoof. Hurin
had the first watch, from a stone outcrop a little way up the
mountain; he would be coming to wake Rand for his turn, soon.</p>

<p>Rand rolled over&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and stopped. In the moonlight
he could see the shape of Selene, bending over his saddlebags, her
hands on the buckles. Her white dress gathered the faint light. &ldquo;Do
you need something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave a jump, and stared toward him. &ldquo;You&mdash;you startled me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He rolled to his feet, shedding the blanket and
wrapping the cloak around himself, and went to her. He was sure he
had left the saddlebags right by his side when he lay down; he
always kept them close. He took them from her. All the buckles were
fastened, even those on the side that held the damning banner. <em>
How can my life depend on keeping it? If anybody sees it and knows
what it is, I&rsquo;ll die for having it</em>. He peered at her
suspiciously.</p>

<p>Selene stayed where she was, looking up at him. The
moon glistened in her dark eyes. &ldquo;It came to me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that
I&rsquo;ve been wearing this dress too long. I could brush it, at least,
if I had something else to wear while I did. One of your shirts,
perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand nodded, feeling a sudden relief. Her dress
looked as clean to him as when he first saw her, but he knew that
if a spot appeared on Egwene&rsquo;s dress, nothing would do but that she
cleaned it immediately. &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; He opened the capacious pocket
into which he had stuffed everything except the banner and pulled
out one of the white silk shirts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Her hands went behind her back. To the
buttons, he realized.</p>

<p>Eyes wide, he spun away from her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you could help me with these, it would be much
easier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand cleared his throat. &ldquo;It would not be proper. It
isn&rsquo;t as if we were promised, or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; <em>Stop thinking about
that! You can never marry anyone</em>. &ldquo;It just wouldn&rsquo;t be
proper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her soft laugh sent a shiver down his back, as if she
had run a finger along his spine. He tried not to listen to the
rustlings behind him. He said, &ldquo;Ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;tomorrow&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;tomorrow,
we&rsquo;ll leave for Cairhien.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what of the Horn of Valere?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe we were wrong. Maybe they are not coming here
at all. Hurin says there are a number of passes through Kinslayer&rsquo;s
Dagger. If they went only a little further west, they do not have
to come into the mountains at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the trail we followed came here. They will come
here. The Horn will come here. You may turn around, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say that, but we don&rsquo;t know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He turned,
and the words died in his mouth. Her dress lay across her arm, and
she wore his shirt, hanging in baggy folds on her. It was a
long-tailed shirt, made for his height, but she was tall for a
woman. The bottom of it came little more than halfway down her
thighs. It was not as if he had never seen a girl&rsquo;s legs before;
girls in the Two Rivers always tied up their skirts to go wading in
Waterwood ponds. But they stopped doing it well before they were
old enough to braid their hair, and this was in the dark, besides.
The moonlight seemed to make her skin glow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it you don&rsquo;t know, Rand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sound of her voice unfroze his joints. With a
loud cough, he whirled to face the other way. &ldquo;Ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I think&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think of the glory, Rand.&rdquo; Her hand touched his
back, and he almost shamed himself with a squeak. &ldquo;Think of the
glory that will come to the one who finds the Horn of Valere. How
proud I&rsquo;ll be to stand beside him who holds the Horn. You have no
idea the heights we will scale together, you and I. With the Horn
of Valere in your hand, you can be a king. You can be another Artur
Hawkwing. You&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord Rand!&rdquo; Hurin panted into the campsite. &ldquo;My
Lord, they&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He skidded to a halt, suddenly making a gurgling
sound. His eyes dropped to the ground, and he stood wringing his
hands. &ldquo;Forgive me, my Lady. I didn&rsquo;t mean to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Forgive
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial sat up, his blanket and cloak falling away.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening? Is it my turn to watch already?&rdquo; He looked
toward Rand and Selene, and even in the moonlight the widening of
his eyes was plain.</p>

<p>Rand heard Selene sigh behind him. He stepped away
from her, still not looking at her. <em>Her legs are so white, so
smooth</em>. &ldquo;What is it, Hurin?&rdquo; He made his voice more moderate;
was he angry with Hurin, himself, or Selene? <em>No reason to be
angry with her</em>. &ldquo;Did you see something, Hurin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sniffer spoke without raising his eyes. &ldquo;A fire,
my Lord, down in the hills. I didn&rsquo;t see it at first. They made it
small, and hid it, but they hid it from somebody following them,
not somebody ahead, and up above. Two miles, Lord Rand. Less than
three, for sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fain,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;Ingtar would not be afraid of
anyone following him. It must be Fain.&rdquo; Suddenly he did not know
what to do, now. They had been waiting for Fain, but now that the
man was only a mile or so away, he was uncertain. &ldquo;In the morning&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;In the morning, we will follow. When Ingtar and the others
catch up, we&rsquo;ll be able to point right to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Selene said. &ldquo;You will let this Ingtar take the
Horn of Valere. And the glory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Without thinking, he turned, and
there she was, legs pale in the moonlight, and as unconcerned that
they were bare as if she were alone. <em>As if we were alone</em>,
the thought came. <em>She wants the man who finds the Horn</em>.
&ldquo;Three of us cannot take it away from them. Ingtar has twenty
lances with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know you cannot take it. How many
followers does this man have? You don&rsquo;t know that, either.&rdquo; Her
voice was calm, but intent. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even know if these men
camped down there do have the Horn. The only way is to go down
yourself and see. Take the <em>alantin</em>; his kind have sharp eyes, even
by moonlight. And he has the strength to carry the Horn in its
chest, if you make the right decision.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>She&rsquo;s right. You do not know for sure if it&rsquo;s
Fain</em>. A fine thing it would be to have Hurin casting about for
a trail that was not there, all of them out in the open if the real
Darkfriends did finally come. &ldquo;I will go alone,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Hurin
and Loial will stand guard for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laughing, Selene came to him so gracefully it almost
seemed she danced. Moonshadows veiled her face in mystery as she
looked up at him, and mystery made her even more beautiful. &ldquo;I am
capable of guarding myself, until you return to protect me. Take
the <em>alantin</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is right, Rand,&rdquo; Loial said, rising. &ldquo;I can see
better by moonlight than you. With my eyes, we may not need to go
as close as you would alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; Rand strode over to his sword and
buckled it at his waist. Bow and quiver he left where they lay; a
bow was not of much use in the dark, and he intended to look, not
fight. &ldquo;Hurin, show me this fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sniffer led him scrambling up the slope to the
outcrop, like a huge stone thumb thrust out of the mountain. The
fire was only a speck&mdash;he missed it the first time Hurin
pointed. Whoever had made it did not mean for it to be seen. He
fixed it in his head.</p>

<p>By the time they returned to the camp, Loial had
saddled Red and his own horse. As Rand climbed to the bay&rsquo;s back,
Selene caught his hand. &ldquo;Remember the glory,&rdquo; she said softly.
&ldquo;Remember.&rdquo; The shirt seemed to fit her better than he recalled,
molding itself to her form.</p>

<p>He drew a deep breath and took his hand back. &ldquo;Guard
her with your life, Hurin. Loial?&rdquo; He heeled Red&rsquo;s flanks gently.
The Ogier&rsquo;s big mount plodded along behind.</p>

<p>They did not try to move quickly. Night shrouded the
mountainside, and moon-cast shadows made footing uncertain. Rand
could not see the fire any longer&mdash;no doubt it was better
hidden from eyes on the same level&mdash;but he had its location
in his mind. For someone who had learned to hunt in the tangle of
the Westwood, in the Two Rivers, finding the fire would be no great
difficulty. <em>And what then?</em> Selene&rsquo;s face loomed before
him. <em>How proud I&rsquo;ll be to stand beside him who holds the
Horn</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Loial,&rdquo; he said suddenly, trying to clear his
thoughts, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s this <em>alantin</em> she calls you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Old Tongue, Rand.&rdquo; The Ogier&rsquo;s horse picked
its way uncertainly, but he guided it almost as surely as if it
were daylight. &ldquo;It means Brother, and is short for <em>tia avende
alantin</em>. Brother to the Trees. Treebrother. It is very formal,
but then, I&rsquo;ve heard the Cairhienin are formal. The noble Houses
are, at least. The common people I saw there were not very formal
at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand frowned. A shepherd would not be very acceptable
to a formal Cairhienin noble House. <em>Light, Mat&rsquo;s right about
you. You&rsquo;re crazy, and with a big head to boot. But if I could
marry</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He wished he could stop thinking, and before he
realized it, the void had formed within him, making thoughts
distant things, as if part of someone else. <em>Saidin</em> shone
at him, beckoned to him. He gritted his teeth and ignored it; it
was like ignoring a burning coal inside his head, but at least he
could hold it at bay. Barely. He almost left the void, but the
Darkfriends were out there in the night, and closer, now. And the
Trollocs. He needed the emptiness, needed even the uneasy calm of
the void. <em>I don&rsquo;t have to touch it. I don&rsquo;t</em>.</p>

<p>After a time, he reined in Red. They stood at the
base of a hill, the wide-scattered trees on its slopes black in the
night. &ldquo;I think we must be close by now,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;Best we
go the rest of the way on foot.&rdquo; He slid from the saddle and tied
the bay&rsquo;s reins to a branch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; Loial whispered, climbing down.
&ldquo;You sound odd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; His voice sounded tight, he realized.
Stretched. <em>Saidin</em> called to him. <em>No!</em> &ldquo;Be careful.
I can&rsquo;t be sure exactly how far it is, but that fire should be
somewhere just ahead of us. On the hilltop, I think.&rdquo; The Ogier
nodded.</p>

<p>Slowly Rand stole from tree to tree, placing each
foot carefully, holding his sword tight so it did not clatter
against a tree trunk. He was grateful for the lack of undergrowth.
Loial followed like a big shadow; Rand could not see much more of
him than that. Everything was moonshadows and darkness.</p>

<p>Suddenly some trick of the moonlight resolved the
shadows ahead of him, and he froze, touching the rough bole of a
leatherleaf. Dim mounds on the ground became men wrapped in
blankets, and apart from them a group of larger mounds. Sleeping
Trollocs. They had doused the fire. One moonbeam, moving through
the branches, caught a shine of gold and silver on the ground,
halfway between the two groups. The moonlight seemed to brighten;
for an instant he could see clearly. The shape of a sleeping man
lay close by to the gleam, but that was not what held his eye. <em>
The chest. The Horn</em>. And something atop it, a point of red
flashing in the moonbeam. <em>The dagger! Why would Fain put</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>?</em></p>

<p>Loial&rsquo;s huge hand settled over Rand&rsquo;s mouth, and a
good part of his face besides. He twisted to look at the Ogier.
Loial pointed off to his right, slowly, as if motion might attract
attention.</p>

<p>At first Rand could not see anything, then a shadow
moved, not ten paces away. A tall, bulky shadow, and snouted.
Rand&rsquo;s breath caught. A Trolloc. It lifted its snout as if
sniffing. Some of them hunted by scent.</p>

<p>For an instant the void wavered. Someone stirred in
the Darkfriend camp, and the Trolloc turned to peer that way.</p>

<p>Rand froze, letting the calm of emptiness envelope
him. His hand was on his sword, but he did not think of it. The
void was all. Whatever happened, happened. He watched the Trolloc
without blinking.</p>

<p>A moment longer the snouted shadow watched the
Darkfriend camp, then, as if satisfied, folded itself down beside a
tree. Almost immediately a low sound, like coarse cloth ripping,
drifted from it.</p>

<p>Loial put his mouth close to Rand&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
asleep,&rdquo; he whispered incredulously.</p>

<p>Rand nodded. Tam had told him Trollocs were lazy, apt
to give up any task but killing unless fear kept them to it. He
turned back to the camp.</p>

<p>All was still and quiet there again. The moonbeam no
longer shone on the chest, but he knew now which shadow it was. He
could see it in his mind, floating beyond the void, glittering
golden, chased with silver, in the glow of <em>saidin</em>. The
Horn of Valere and the dagger Mat needed, both almost within reach
of his hand. Selene&rsquo;s face drifted with the chest. They could
follow Fain&rsquo;s party in the morning, and wait until Ingtar joined
them. If Ingtar did come, if he still followed the trail without
his sniffer. No, there would never be a better chance. All within
reach of his hand. Selene was waiting on the mountain.</p>

<p>Motioning for Loial to follow, Rand dropped to his
belly and crawled toward the chest. He heard the Ogier&rsquo;s muffled
gasp, but his eyes were fixed on that one shadowed mound ahead.</p>

<p>Darkfriends and Trollocs lay to left and right of
him, but once he had seen Tam stalk close enough to a deer to put
his hand on its flank before the animal bounded off; he had tried
to learn from Tam. <em>Madness!</em> The thought flew by dimly,
almost out of reach. <em>This is madness!
You</em>&mdash;<em>are</em>&mdash;<em>going</em>&mdash;<em>mad!</em>
Dim thoughts; someone else&rsquo;s thoughts.</p>

<p>Slowly, silently, he slithered to that one special
shadow, and put out a hand. Ornate traceries worked in gold met his
touch. It was the chest that held the Horn of Valere. His hand
touched something else, on the lid. The dagger, bare-bladed. In the
dark, his eyes widened. Remembering what it had done to Mat, he
jerked back, the void shifting with his agitation.</p>

<p>The man sleeping nearby&mdash;no more than two paces
from the chest; no one else lay so close by spans&mdash;groaned in
his sleep and thrashed at his blankets. Rand allowed the void to
sweep thought and fear away. Murmuring uneasily in his sleep, the
man stilled.</p>

<p>Rand let his hand go back to the dagger, not quite
touching it. It had not harmed Mat in the beginning. Not much, at
least; not quickly. In one swift motion he lifted the dagger, stuck
it behind his belt, and pulled his hand away, as if it might help
to minimize the time it touched his bare skin. Perhaps it would,
and Mat would die without the dagger. He could feel it there,
almost a weight pulling him down, pressing against him. But in the
void sensation was as distant as thought, and the feel of the
dagger faded quickly to something he was used to.</p>

<p>He wasted only a moment more staring at the
shadow-wrapped chest&mdash;the Horn had to be inside, but he did
not know how to open it and he could not lift it by himself&mdash;then he looked around for Loial. He found the Ogier crouched not
far behind him, massive head swiveling as he peered back and forth
from sleeping human Darkfriends to sleeping Trollocs. Even in the
night it was plain Loial&rsquo;s eyes were as wide as they could go; they
looked as big as saucers in the light of the moon. Rand reached out
and took Loial&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>The Ogier gave a start and gasped. Rand put a finger
across his lips, set Loial&rsquo;s hand on the chest, and mimed lifting.
For a time&mdash;it seemed forever, in the night, with Darkfriends
and Trollocs all around; it could not have been more than
heartbeats&mdash;Loial stared. Then, slowly, he put his arms
around the golden chest and stood. He made it seem effortless.</p>

<p>Ever so carefully, even more carefully than he had
come in, Rand began to walk out of the camp, behind Loial and the
chest. Both hands on his sword, he watched the sleeping
Darkfriends, the still shapes of the Trollocs. All those shadowed
figures began to be swallowed deeper in the darkness as they drew
away. <em>Almost free. We&rsquo;ve done it!</em></p>

<p>The man who had been sleeping near the chest suddenly
sat up with a strangled yell, then leaped to his feet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone!
Wake, you filth! It&rsquo;s gooonnne!&rdquo; Fain&rsquo;s voice; even in the void
Rand recognized it. The others scrambled erect, Darkfriends and
Trollocs, calling to know what was happening, growling and
snarling. Fain&rsquo;s voice rose to a howl. &ldquo;I know it is you, al&rsquo;Thor!
You&rsquo;re hiding from me, but I know you are out there! Find him! Find
him! Al&rsquo;Thoooor!&rdquo; Men and Trollocs scattered in every
direction.</p>

<p>Wrapped in emptiness, Rand kept moving. Almost
forgotten in entering the camp, <em>saidin</em> pulsed at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He cannot see us,&rdquo; Loial whispered low. &ldquo;Once we
reach the horses&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A Trolloc leaped out of the dark at them, cruel
eagle&rsquo;s beak in a man&rsquo;s face where mouth and nose should have been,
scythe-like sword already whistling through the air.</p>

<p>Rand moved without thought. He was one with the
blade. Cat Dances on the Wall. The Trolloc screamed as it fell,
screamed again as it died.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run, Loial!&rdquo; Rand commanded. <em>Saidin</em> called
to him. &ldquo;Run!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was dimly aware of Loial lumbering to an awkward
gallop, but another Trolloc loomed from the night, boar-snouted and
tusked, spiked axe raised. Smoothly Rand glided between Trolloc and
Ogier; Loial must get the Horn away. Head and shoulders taller than
Rand, half again as wide, the Trolloc came at him with a silent
snarl. The Courtier Taps His Fan. No scream, this time. He
walked backwards after Loial, watching the night. <em>Saidin</em>
sang to him, such a sweet song. <em>The Power could burn them all,
burn Fain and all the rest to cinders. No!</em></p>

<p>Two more Trollocs, wolf and ram, gleaming teeth and
curling horns. Lizard in the Thornbush. He rose smoothly from one
knee as the second toppled, horns almost brushing his shoulder. The
song of <em>saidin</em> caressed him with seduction, pulled him
with a thousand silken strings. <em>Burn them all with the Power.
No. No! Better dead than that. If I were dead, it would be done
with</em>.</p>

<p>A knot of Trollocs came into sight, hunting
uncertainly. Three of them, four. Suddenly one pointed to Rand and
raised a howl the rest answered as they charged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let it be done with!&rdquo; Rand shouted, and leaped to
meet them.</p>

<p>For an instant surprise slowed them, then they came
on with guttural cries, gleeful, bloodthirsty, swords and axes
raised. He danced among them to the song of <em>saidin</em>.
Hummingbird Kisses the Honeyrose. So cunning that song, filling
him. Cat on Hot Sand. The sword seemed alive in his hands as it had
never been before, and he fought as if a heron-mark blade could
keep <em>saidin</em> from him. The Heron Spreads Its Wings.</p>

<p>Rand stared at the motionless shapes on the ground
around him. &ldquo;Better to be dead,&rdquo; he murmured. He raised his eyes,
back up the hill toward where the camp lay. Fain was there, and
Darkfriends, and more Trollocs. Too many to fight. Too many to face
and live. He took a step that way. Another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand, come on!&rdquo; Loial&rsquo;s urgent, whispered call
drifted through the emptiness to him. &ldquo;For life and the Light,
Rand, come on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carefully, Rand bent to wipe his blade on a Trolloc&rsquo;s
coat. Then, as formally as if Lan were watching him train, he
sheathed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As though he knew of no urgency, Rand joined Loial by
the horses. The Ogier was tying the golden chest atop his saddle
with straps from his saddlebags. His cloak was stuffed underneath
to help balance the chest on the rounded saddle seat.</p>

<p><em>Saidin</em> sang no more. It was there, that
stomach-turning glow, but it held back as if he truly had fought it
off. Wonderingly, he let the void vanish. &ldquo;I think I am going mad,&rdquo;
he said. Suddenly realizing where they were, he peered back the way
they had come. Shouts and howls came from half a dozen different
directions; signs of search, but none of pursuit. Yet. He swung up
onto Red&rsquo;s back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I do not understand half of what you say,&rdquo;
Loial said. &ldquo;If you must go mad, could it at least wait until we
are back with the Lady Selene and Hurin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you going to ride with that in your
saddle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will run!&rdquo; The Ogier suited his words by breaking
into a quick trot, pulling his horse behind him by the reins. Rand
followed.</p>

<p>The pace Loial set was as fast as a horse could trot.
Rand was sure the Ogier could not keep it for long, but Loial&rsquo;s
feet did not flag. Rand decided that his boast of once outrunning a
horse might really be true. Now and again Loial looked behind them
as he ran, but the shouts of Darkfriends and howls of Trollocs
faded with distance.</p>

<p>Even when the ground began to slope upwards more
sharply, Loial&rsquo;s pace barely slowed, and he trotted into their
campsite on the mountainside with only a little hard breathing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have it.&rdquo; Selene&rsquo;s voice was exultant as her
gaze rested on the ornately worked chest on Loial&rsquo;s saddle. She was
wearing her own dress again; it looked as white as new snow to
Rand. &ldquo;I knew you would make the right choice. May I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;have a
look at it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did any of them follow, my Lord?&rdquo; Hurin asked
anxiously. He stared at the chest with awe, but his eyes slid off
into the night, down the mountain. &ldquo;If they followed, we&rsquo;ll have to
move quick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think they did. Go to the outcrop and see
if you can see anything.&rdquo; Rand climbed down from his saddle as
Hurin hurried up the mountain. &ldquo;Selene, I don&rsquo;t know how to open
the chest. Loial, do you?&rdquo; The Ogier shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me try&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Even for a woman of Selene&rsquo;s
height, Loial&rsquo;s saddle was high above the ground. She reached up to
touch the finely wrought patterns on the chest, ran her hands
across them, pressed. There was a click, and she pushed the lid up,
let it fall open.</p>

<p>As she stretched on tiptoe to put a hand inside, Rand
reached over her shoulder and lifted out the Horn of Valere. He had
seen it once before, but never touched it. Though beautifully made,
it did not look a thing of great age, or power. A curled golden
horn, gleaming in the faint light, with inlaid silver script
flowing around the mouth of the bell. He touched the strange
letters with a finger. They seemed to catch the moon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Tia mi aven Moridin isainde vadin</em>,&rdquo; Selene
said. &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;The grave is no bar to my call.&rsquo; You <em>will</em> be
greater than Artur Hawkwing ever was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am taking it to Shienar, to Lord Agelmar.&rdquo; <em>It
should go to Tar Valon, he thought, but I&rsquo;m done with Aes Sedai.
Let Agelmar or Ingtar take it to them</em>. He set the Horn back in
the chest; it cast back the moonlight, pulled the eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is madness,&rdquo; Selene said.</p>

<p>Rand flinched at the word. &ldquo;Mad or not, it is what
I&rsquo;m doing. I told you, Selene, I want no part of greatness. Back
there, I thought I did. For a while, I thought I wanted things&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; <em>Light, she&rsquo;s so beautiful. Egwene. Selene. I&rsquo;m not worthy of
either of them</em>. &ldquo;Something seemed to take hold of me.&rdquo; Saidin
<em>came for me, but I fought it off with a sword. Or is that mad,
too?</em> He breathed deeply. &ldquo;Shienar is where the Horn of Valere
belongs. Or if not there, Lord Agelmar will know what to do with
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hurin appeared from up the mountain. &ldquo;The fire&rsquo;s
there again, Lord Rand, and bigger than ever. And I thought I heard
shouting. It was all down in the hills. I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ve come
upon the mountain, yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You misunderstand me, Rand,&rdquo; Selene said. &ldquo;You
cannot go back, now. You are committed. Those Friends of the Dark
will not simply go away because you&rsquo;ve taken the Horn from them.
Far from it. Unless you know some way to kill them all, they will
be hunting you now as you hunted them before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Loial and Hurin looked surprised at Rand&rsquo;s
vehemence. He softened his tone. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know any way to kill them
all. They can live forever for all of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Selene&rsquo;s long hair shifted in waves as she shook her
head. &ldquo;Then you cannot go back, only onward. You can reach the
safety of Cairhien&rsquo;s walls long before you could return to Shienar.
Does the thought of a few more days in my company seem so
onerous?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stared at the chest. Selene&rsquo;s company was far
from burdensome, but near her he could not help thinking things he
should not. Still, trying to ride back north meant risking Fain and
his followers. She was right in that. Fain would never give up.
Ingtar would not give up, either. If Ingtar came on southward, and
Rand knew of no reason for him to turn aside, he would arrive at
Cairhien, soon or late.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cairhien,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;You will have to show me
where you live, Selene. I&rsquo;ve never been to Cairhien.&rdquo; He reached to
close the chest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You took something else from the Friends of the
Dark?&rdquo; Selene said. &ldquo;You spoke earlier of a dagger.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>How could I forget?</em> He left the chest as it
was and pulled the dagger from his belt. The bare blade curved like
a horn, and the quillons were golden serpents. Set in the hilt, a
ruby as big as his thumbnail winked like an evil eye in the
moonlight. Ornate as it was, tainted as he knew it was, it felt no
different from any other knife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; Selene said. &ldquo;Do not cut yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand felt a shiver inside. If simply carrying it was
dangerous, he did not want to know what a cut from it would do.
&ldquo;This is from Shadar Logoth,&rdquo; he told the others. &ldquo;It will twist
whoever carries it for long, taint them to the bone the way Shadar
Logoth is tainted. Without Aes Sedai Healing, that taint will kill,
eventually.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that is what ails Mat,&rdquo; Loial said softly. &ldquo;I
never suspected.&rdquo; Hurin stared at the dagger in Rand&rsquo;s hand and
wiped his own hands on the front of his coat. The sniffer did not
look happy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of us must handle it any more than is
necessary,&rdquo; Rand went on. &ldquo;I will find some way to carry it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is dangerous.&rdquo; Selene frowned at the blade as if
the snakes were real, and poisonous. &ldquo;Throw it away. Leave it, or
bury it if you wish to keep it from other hands, but be rid of
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat needs it,&rdquo; Rand said firmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is too dangerous. You said so yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He needs it. The Am&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the Aes Sedai said he
would die without it to use in Healing him.&rdquo; <em>They still have a
string on him, but this blade will cut it. Until I&rsquo;m rid of it, and
the Horn, they have a string on me, but I&rsquo;ll not dance however much
they pull</em>.</p>

<p>He set the dagger in the chest, inside the curl of
the Horn&mdash;there was just room for it&mdash;and pulled the
lid down. It locked with a sharp snap. &ldquo;That should shield us from
it.&rdquo; He hoped it would. Lan said the time to sound most sure was
when you were least certain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The chest will surely shield us,&rdquo; Selene said in a
tight voice. &ldquo;And now I mean to finish what is left of my night&rsquo;s
sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shook his head. &ldquo;We are too close. Fain seems
able to find me, sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seek the Oneness if you are afraid,&rdquo; Selene
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to be as far from those Darkfriends come
morning as we can be. I will saddle your mare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stubborn!&rdquo; She sounded angry, and when he looked at
her, her mouth curved in a smile that never came close to her dark
eyes. &ldquo;A stubborn man is best, once&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Her voice trailed off,
and that worried him. Women often seemed to leave things unsaid,
and in his limited experience it was what they did not say that
proved the most trouble. She watched in silence as he slung her
saddle onto the white mare&rsquo;s back and bent to fashion the
girths.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">&ldquo;Gather them all in!&rdquo; Fain snarled. The goat-snouted
Trolloc backed away from him. The fire, piled high with wood now,
lit the hilltop with flickering shadows. His human followers
huddled near the blaze, fearful to be out in the dark with the rest
of the Trollocs. &ldquo;Gather them, every one that still lives, and if
any think to run, let them know they&rsquo;ll get what that one got.&rdquo; He
gestured to the first Trolloc that had brought him word al&rsquo;Thor was
not to be found. It still snapped at ground muddied with its own
blood, hooves scraping trenches as they jerked. &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; Fain
whispered, and the goat-snouted Trolloc ran into the night.</p>

<p>Fain glanced contemptuously at the other humans&mdash;<em>They&rsquo;ll have their uses still</em>&mdash;then turned to
stare into the night, toward Kinslayer&rsquo;s Dagger. Al&rsquo;Thor was up
there, somewhere, in the mountains. With the Horn. His teeth grated
audibly at the thought. He did not know where, exactly, but
something pulled him toward the mountains. Toward al&rsquo;Thor. That
much of the Dark One&rsquo;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;gift&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;remained to him. He had
hardly thought of it, had tried not to think of it, until suddenly,
after the Horn was gone&mdash;<em>Gone!</em>&mdash;al&rsquo;Thor was
there, drawing him as meat draws a starving dog.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a dog no longer. A dog no longer!&rdquo; He heard the
others shifting uneasily around the fire, but he ignored them.
&ldquo;You will pay for what was done to me, al&rsquo;Thor! The world will
pay!&rdquo; He cackled at the night with mad laughter. &ldquo;The world
will pay!&rdquo;</p>
