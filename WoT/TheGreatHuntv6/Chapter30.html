<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n
the room shared by Hurin and Loial, Rand peered
through the window at the ordered lines and terraces of Cairhien,
the stone buildings and slate roofs. He could not see the
Illuminators&rsquo; chapter house; even if huge towers and great lords&rsquo;
houses had not been in the way, the city walls would have prevented
it. The Illuminators were on everyone&rsquo;s tongues in the city, even
now, days after the night when they had lofted only one nightflower
into the sky, and that early. A dozen different versions of the
scandal were being told, discounting minor variations, but none
close to the truth.</p>

<p>Rand turned away. He hoped no one had been hurt in
the fire, but the Illuminators had not so far admitted there had
been a fire. They were a close-mouthed lot about what went on
inside their chapter house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will take the next watch,&rdquo; he told Hurin, &ldquo;as soon
as I come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no need, my Lord.&rdquo; Hurin bowed as deeply as
any Cairhienin. &ldquo;I can keep watch. Truly, my Lord need not trouble
himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand drew a deep breath and exchanged looks with
Loial. The Ogier only shrugged. The sniffer was growing more formal
every day they remained in Cairhien; the Ogier simply commented
that humans often acted oddly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurin,&rdquo; Rand said, &ldquo;you used to call me Lord Rand,
and you used not to bow every time I looked at you.&rdquo; <em>I want him
to unbend and call me Lord Rand again</em>, he thought with
amazement. <em>Lord Rand! Light, we have to get out of here before
I start</em> wanting <em>him to bow</em>. &ldquo;Will you please sit
down? You make me tired, looking at you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hurin stood with his back stiff, yet appeared ready
to leap to perform any task Rand might request. He neither sat down
nor relaxed now. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be proper, my Lord. We have to show
these Cairhienin we know how to be every bit as proper as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you stop saying that!&rdquo; Rand shouted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you wish, my Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was an effort for Rand not to sigh again. &ldquo;Hurin,
I&rsquo;m sorry. I should not have shouted at you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your right, my Lord,&rdquo; Hurin said simply. &ldquo;If I
don&rsquo;t do the way you want, it&rsquo;s your right to shout.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stepped toward the sniffer with the intention of
grabbing the man&rsquo;s collar and shaking him.</p>

<p>A knock on the connecting door to Rand&rsquo;s room froze
them all, but Rand was pleased to see that Hurin did not wait to
ask permission before picking up his sword. The heron-mark blade
was at Rand&rsquo;s waist; going out, he touched its hilt. He waited for
Loial to seat himself on his long bed, arranging his legs and the
tails of his coat to further obscure the blanket-covered chest
under the bed, then yanked open the door.</p>

<p>The innkeeper stood there, rocking with eagerness and
pushing his tray at Rand. Two sealed parchments lay on the tray.
&ldquo;Forgive me, my Lord,&rdquo; Cuale said breathlessly. &ldquo;I could not wait
until you came down, and then you were not in your own room, and&mdash;and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Forgive me, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He jiggled the tray.</p>

<p>Rand snatched the invitations&mdash;there had been
so many&mdash;without looking at them, took the innkeeper&rsquo;s arm,
and turned him toward the door to the hall. &ldquo;Thank you, Master
Cuale, for taking the trouble. If you&rsquo;ll leave us alone, now,
please&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my Lord,&rdquo; Cuale protested, &ldquo;these are from&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Rand pushed the man into the hall and
pulled the door shut firmly. He tossed the parchments onto the
table. &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t done that before. Loial, do you think he was
listening at the door before he knocked?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are starting to think like these Cairhienin.&rdquo;
The Ogier laughed, but his ears twitched thoughtfully and he added,
&ldquo;Still, he is Cairhienin, so he may well have been. I don&rsquo;t think
we said anything he should not have heard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand tried to remember. None of them had mentioned
the Horn of Valere, or Trollocs, or Darkfriends. When he found
himself wondering what Cuale could make of what they actually had
said, he gave himself a shake. &ldquo;This place is getting to you, too,&rdquo;
he muttered to himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord?&rdquo; Hurin had picked up the sealed parchments
and was gazing wide-eyed at the seals. &ldquo;My Lord, these are from
Lord Barthanes, High Seat of House Damodred, and from&rdquo;&mdash;his
voice dropped with awe&mdash;&ldquo;the King.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand waved them away. &ldquo;They still go in the fire like
the rest. Unopened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my Lord!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurin,&rdquo; Rand said patiently, &ldquo;you and Loial between
you have explained this Great Game to me. If I go wherever it is
they&rsquo;ve invited me, the Cairhienin will read something into it and
think I am part of somebody&rsquo;s plot. If I don&rsquo;t go, they&rsquo;ll read
something into that. If I send back an answer, they will dig for
meaning in it, and the same if I don&rsquo;t answer. And since half of
Cairhien apparently spies on the other half, everybody knows what I
do. I burned the first two, and I will burn these, just like all
the others.&rdquo; One day there had been twelve in the pile he tossed
into the common-room fireplace, seals unbroken. &ldquo;Whatever they make
of it, at least it&rsquo;s the same for everybody. I am not for anyone in
Cairhien, and I am not against anyone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have tried to tell you,&rdquo; Loial said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
think it works that way. Whatever you do, Cairhienin will see some
sort of plot in it. At least, that is what Elder Haman always
said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hurin held the sealed invitations out to Rand as if
offering gold. &ldquo;My Lord, this one bears the personal seal of
Galldrian. His personal seal, my Lord. And this one the personal
seal of Lord Barthanes, who is next to the King himself in power.
My Lord, burn these, and you make enemies as powerful as you can
find. Burning them&rsquo;s worked so far because the other Houses are all
waiting to see what you&rsquo;re up to, and thinking you must have
powerful allies to risk insulting them. But Lord Barthanes&mdash;and the King! Insult them, and they&rsquo;ll act for sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand scrubbed his hands through his hair. &ldquo;What if I
refuse them both?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t work, my Lord. Every last House has sent
you an invitation, now. If you decline these&mdash;well, for sure
at least one of the other Houses will figure, if you&rsquo;re not allied
with the King or Lord Barthanes, then they can answer your insult
of burning their invitation. My Lord, I hear the Houses in Cairhien
use killers, now. A knife in the street. An arrow from a rooftop.
Poison slipped in your wine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could accept them both,&rdquo; Loial suggested. &ldquo;I
know you don&rsquo;t want to, Rand, but it might even be fun. An evening
at a lord&rsquo;s manor, or even at the Royal Palace. Rand, the
Shienarans believed in you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand grimaced. He knew it had been chance that the
Shienarans thought he was a lord; a chance likeness of names, a
rumor among the servants, and Moiraine and the Amyrlin stirring it
all. But Selene had believed it, too. <em>Maybe she&rsquo;ll be at one of
these</em>.</p>

<p>Hurin was shaking his head violently, though.
&ldquo;Builder, you don&rsquo;t know <em>Daes Dae&rsquo;mar</em> as well as you think
you do. Not the way they play it in Cairhien, not now. With most
Houses, it wouldn&rsquo;t matter. Even when they&rsquo;re plotting against each
other to the knife, they act like they aren&rsquo;t, out where everybody
can see. But not these two. House Damodred held the throne until
Laman lost it, and they want it back. The King would crush them, if
they weren&rsquo;t nearly as powerful as he is. You can&rsquo;t find bitterer
rivals than House Riatin and House Damodred. If my Lord accepts
both, both Houses will know it as soon as he sends his answers, and
they&rsquo;ll both think he&rsquo;s part of some plot by the other against
them. They&rsquo;ll use the knife and the poison as quick as look at
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I suppose,&rdquo; Rand growled, &ldquo;if I only accept one,
the other will think I&rsquo;m allied with that House.&rdquo; Hurin nodded.
&ldquo;And they will probably try to kill me to stop whatever I&rsquo;m
involved in.&rdquo; Hurin nodded again. &ldquo;Then do you have any suggestion
as to how I avoid any of them wanting to see me dead?&rdquo; Hurin shook
his head. &ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d never burned those first two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my Lord. But it wouldn&rsquo;t have made much
difference, I&rsquo;m guessing. Whoever you accepted or rejected, these
Cairhienin would see something in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand held out his hand, and Hurin laid the two folded
parchments in it. The one was sealed, not with the Tree and Crown
of House Damodred, but with Barthanes&rsquo;s Charging Boar. The other
bore Galldrian&rsquo;s Stag. Personal seals. Apparently he had managed to
rouse interest in the highest quarters by doing nothing at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These people are crazy,&rdquo; he said, trying to think of
a way out of this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will let them see me in the common room with
these,&rdquo; he said slowly. Whatever was seen in the common room at
midday was known in ten Houses before nightfall, and in all of them
by daybreak next. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t break the seals. That way, they will
know I have not answered either one yet. As long as they are
waiting to see which way I jump, maybe I can earn a few more days.
Ingtar has to come soon. He has to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that is thinking like a Cairhienin, my Lord,&rdquo;
Hurin said, grinning.</p>

<p>Rand gave him a sour look, then stuffed the
parchments into his pocket on top of Selene&rsquo;s letters. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,
Loial. Maybe Ingtar has arrived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he and Loial reached the common room, no man and
woman in it looked at Rand. Cuale was polishing a silver tray as if
his life depended on its gleam. The serving girls hurried between
the tables as if Rand and the Ogier did not exist. Every last
person at the tables stared into his or her mug as if the secrets
of power lay in wine or ale. Not one of them said a word.</p>

<p>After a moment, he pulled the two invitations from
his pocket and studied the seals, then stuck them back. Cuale gave
a little jump as Rand started for the door. Before it closed behind
him, he heard conversation spring up again.</p>

<p>Rand strode down the street so fast that Loial did
not have to shorten his stride to stay beside him. &ldquo;We have to find
a way out of the city, Loial. This trick with the invitations can&rsquo;t
work more than two or three days. If Ingtar doesn&rsquo;t come by then,
we must leave anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; Loial said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial began ticking off points on his thick fingers.
&ldquo;Fain is out there, or there would not have been Trollocs in the
Foregate. If we ride out, they will be on us as soon as we are out
of sight of the city. If we travel with a merchant train, they&rsquo;ll
certainly attack it.&rdquo; No merchant would have more than five or six
guards, and they would probably run as soon as they saw a Trolloc.
&ldquo;If only we knew how many Trollocs Fain has, and how many
Darkfriends. You have cut his numbers down.&rdquo; He did not mention the
Trolloc he had killed, but from his frown, his long eyebrows
hanging down onto his cheeks, he was thinking of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter how many he has,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;Ten
are as bad as a hundred. If ten Trollocs attack us, I don&rsquo;t think
we&rsquo;ll get away again.&rdquo; He avoided thinking of the way he might,
just might, deal with ten Trollocs. It had not worked when he tried
to help Loial, after all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think we could, either. I don&rsquo;t think we
have money to take passage very far, but even so, if we tried to
reach the Foregate docks&mdash;well, Fain must have Darkfriends
watching. If he thought we were taking ship, I don&rsquo;t believe he
would care who saw the Trollocs. Even if we fought free of them
somehow, we would have to explain ourselves to the city guards, and
they would certainly not believe we cannot open the chest, so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are not letting any Cairhienin see that chest,
Loial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Ogier nodded. &ldquo;And the city docks are no good,
either.&rdquo; The city docks were reserved for the grain barges and the
pleasure craft of the lords and ladies. No one came to them without
permission. One could look down on them from the wall, but it was a
drop that would break even Loial&rsquo;s neck. Loial wiggled his thumb as
if trying to think of a point for that, too. &ldquo;I suppose it is too
bad we cannot reach Stedding Tsofu. Trollocs would never come into
a <em>stedding</em>. But I don&rsquo;t suppose they would let us get that
far without attacking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand did not answer. They had reached the big
guardhouse just inside the gate by which they had first entered
Cairhien. Outside, the Foregate teemed and milled, and a pair of
guards kept watch on them. Rand thought a man, dressed in what had
once been good Shienaran clothes, ducked back into the crowd at the
sight of him, but he could not be sure. There were too many people
in clothes from too many lands, all of them hurrying. He went up
the steps into the guardhouse, past breastplated guards on either
side of the door.</p>

<p>The large anteroom had hard wooden benches for people
with business there, mainly folk waiting with a humble patience,
wearing the plain, dark garments that marked the poorer commoners.
There were a few Foregaters among them, picked out by shabbiness
and bright colors, no doubt hoping for permission to seek work
inside the walls.</p>

<p>Rand went straight to the long table in the back of
the room. There was only one man seated behind it, not a soldier,
with one green bar across his coat. A plump fellow whose skin
looked too tight, he adjusted documents on the table and shifted
the position of his inkwell twice before looking up at Rand and
Loial with a false smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How may I help you, my Lord?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The same way I hoped you could help me yesterday,&rdquo;
Rand said with more patience than he felt, &ldquo;and the day before, and
the day before that. Has Lord Ingtar come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord Ingtar, my Lord?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand took a deep breath and let it out slowly. &ldquo;Lord
Ingtar of House Shinowa, from Shienar. The same man I have asked
after every day I&rsquo;ve come here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one of that name has entered the city, my
Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you certain? Don&rsquo;t you need to look at your
lists, at least?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord, the lists of foreigners who have come to
Cairhien are exchanged among the guardhouses at sunrise and at
sunset, and I examine them as soon as they come before me. No
Shienaran lord has entered Cairhien in some time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the Lady Selene? Before you ask again, I do not
know her House. But I&rsquo;ve given you her name, and I have described
her to you three times. Isn&rsquo;t that enough?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man spread his hands. &ldquo;I am sorry, my Lord. Not
knowing her House makes it very difficult.&rdquo; He had a bland look on
his face. Rand wondered whether he would tell even if he knew.</p>

<p>A movement at one of the doors behind the desk caught
Rand&rsquo;s eye&mdash;a man starting to step into the anteroom, then turning
away hurriedly. &ldquo;Perhaps Captain Caldevwin can help me,&rdquo; Rand told
the clerk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Caldevwin, my Lord?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just saw him behind you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry, my Lord. If there was a Captain
Caldevwin in the guardhouse, I would know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stared at him until Loial touched his shoulder.
&ldquo;Rand, I think we might as well go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you for your help,&rdquo; Rand said in a tight
voice. &ldquo;I will return tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is my pleasure to do what I may,&rdquo; the man said
with his false smile.</p>

<p>Rand stalked out of the guardhouse so fast that Loial
had to hurry to catch him up in the street. &ldquo;He was lying, you
know, Loial.&rdquo; He did not slow down, but rather hurried along as if
he could burn away some of his frustration through physical
exertion. &ldquo;Caldevwin was there. He could be lying about all of it.
Ingtar could already be here, looking for us. I&rsquo;ll bet he knows who
Selene is, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, Rand. <em>Daes Dae&rsquo;mar</em>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light, I&rsquo;m tired of hearing about the Great Game. I
don&rsquo;t want to play it. I do not want to be any part of it.&rdquo; Loial
walked beside him, saying nothing. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Rand said at last.
&ldquo;They think I&rsquo;m a lord, and in Cairhien, even outland lords are
part of the Game. I wish I&rsquo;d never put on this coat.&rdquo; <em>
Moiraine</em>, he thought bitterly. <em>She&rsquo;s still causing me
trouble</em>. Almost immediately, though, if reluctantly, he
admitted that she could hardly be blamed for this. There had always
been some reason to pretend to be what he was not. First keeping
Hurin&rsquo;s spirits up, and then trying to impress Selene. After
Selene, there had not seemed to be any way out of it. His steps
slowed until he came to a halt. &ldquo;When Moiraine let me go, I thought
things would be simple again. Even chasing after the Horn, even
with&mdash;with everything, I thought it would be simple.&rdquo; <em>
Even with</em> saidin <em>inside your head?</em> &ldquo;Light, what I
wouldn&rsquo;t give to have everything be simple again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Ta&rsquo;veren</em>,&rdquo; Loial began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not want to hear about that, either.&rdquo; Rand
started off again as fast as before. &ldquo;All I want is to give the
dagger to Mat, and the Horn to Ingtar.&rdquo; <em>Then what? Go mad? Die?
If I die before I go mad, at least I won&rsquo;t hurt anybody else. But I
don&rsquo;t want to die, either. Lan can talk about Sheathing the Sword,
but I&rsquo;m a shepherd, not a Warder</em>. &ldquo;If I can just not touch
it,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;maybe I can&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Owyn almost made it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, Rand? I didn&rsquo;t hear that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was nothing,&rdquo; Rand said wearily. &ldquo;I wish Ingtar
would get here. And Mat, and Perrin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They walked along in silence for a time, with Rand
lost in thought. Thom&rsquo;s nephew had lasted almost three years by
channeling only when he thought he had to. If Owyn had managed to
limit how often he channeled, it must be possible to not channel at
all, no matter how seductive <em>saidin</em> was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand,&rdquo; Loial said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a fire up ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand got rid of his unwelcome thoughts and looked off
into the city, frowning. A thick column of black smoke billowed up
above the rooftops. He could not see what lay at the base of it,
but it was too close to the inn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Darkfriends,&rdquo; he said, staring at the smoke.
&ldquo;Trollocs can&rsquo;t come inside the walls without being seen, but
Darkfriends&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Hurin!&rdquo; He broke into a run, Loial easily keeping
pace beside him.</p>

<p>The closer they came, the more certain it was, until
they rounded the last stone-terraced corner and there was The
Defender of the Dragonwall, smoke pouring out of its upper windows
and flames breaking through the roof. A crowd had gathered in front
of the inn. Cuale, shouting and jumping about, was directing men
carrying furnishings out into the street. A double line of men
passed inside buckets filled with water from a well down the street
and empty buckets back out. Most of the people only stood and
watched; a new gout of flame burst through the slate roof, and they
gave a loud <em>aaaah</em>.</p>

<p>Rand pushed through the crowd to the innkeeper.
&ldquo;Where is Hurin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Careful with that table!&rdquo; Cuale shouted. &ldquo;Do not
scrape it!&rdquo; He looked at Rand and blinked. His face was smudged
with smoke. &ldquo;My Lord? Who? Your manservant? I do not remember
seeing him, my Lord. No doubt he went out. Do not drop those
candlesticks, fool! They are silver!&rdquo; Cuale danced off to harangue
the men lugging his belongings out of the inn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurin wouldn&rsquo;t have gone out,&rdquo; Loial said. &ldquo;He would
not have left the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He looked around and left it unsaid; some
of the onlookers seemed to find an Ogier as interesting as the
fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Rand said, and plunged into the inn.</p>

<p>The common room hardly seemed as if the building were
on fire. The double line of men stretched up the stairs, passing
their buckets, and others scrambled to carry out what furniture was
left, but there was no more smoke down here than if something had
been burning the kitchen. As Rand pressed upstairs, it began to
thicken. Coughing, he ran up the steps.</p>

<p>The lines stopped short of the second landing, men
halfway up the stairs hurling their water up into a smoke-filled
hallway. Flames licking up the walls flickered red through the
black smoke.</p>

<p>One of the men grabbed Rand&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;You cannot go up
there, my Lord. It is all lost above here. Ogier, speak to
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the first Rand realized that Loial had
followed him. &ldquo;Go back, Loial. I&rsquo;ll bring him out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot carry Hurin and the chest both, Rand.&rdquo;
The Ogier shrugged. &ldquo;Besides, I won&rsquo;t leave my books to burn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then keep low. Under the smoke.&rdquo; Rand dropped to his
hands and knees on the stairs, and scrambled up the rest of the
way. There was cleaner air down near the floor; still smoky enough
to make him cough, but he could breathe it. Yet even the air seemed
blistering hot. He could not get enough of it through his nose. He
breathed through his mouth, and felt his tongue drying.</p>

<p>Some of the water the men threw landed on him,
soaking him to the skin. The coolness was only a momentary relief;
the heat came right back. He crawled on determinedly, aware of
Loial behind him only from the Ogier&rsquo;s coughing.</p>

<p>One wall of the hallway was almost solid flame, and
the floor near it had already begun to add thin tendrils to the
cloud that hung over his head. He was glad he could not see what
lay above the smoke. Ominous crackling told enough.</p>

<p>The door to Hurin&rsquo;s room had not caught yet, but it
was hot enough that he had to try twice before he could manage to
push it open. The first thing to meet his eye was Hurin, sprawled
on the floor. Rand crawled to the sniffer and lifted him up. There
was a lump on the side of his head the size of a plum.</p>

<p>Hurin opened unfocused eyes. &ldquo;Lord Rand?&rdquo; he murmured
faintly. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;knock at the door&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;thought it was more invi&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; His eyes rolled back in his head. Rand felt for a heartbeat,
and sagged with relief when he found it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Loial coughed. He was beside his bed,
with the covers thrown up to reveal the bare boards underneath. The
chest was gone.</p>

<p>Above the smoke, the ceiling creaked, and flaming
pieces of wood fell to the floor.</p>

<p>Rand said, &ldquo;Get your books. I will take Hurin.
Hurry.&rdquo; He started to drape the limp sniffer over his shoulders,
but Loial took Hurin from him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The books will have to burn, Rand. You can&rsquo;t carry
him and crawl, and if you stand up, you will never reach the
stairs.&rdquo; The Ogier pulled Hurin up onto his broad back, arms and
legs hanging to either side. The ceiling gave a loud crack. &ldquo;We
must hurry, Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go, Loial. Go, and I&rsquo;ll follow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Ogier crawled into the hall with his burden, and
Rand started after him. Then he stopped, staring back at the
connecting door to his room. The banner was still in there. The
banner of the Dragon. <em>Let it burn</em>, he thought, and an
answering thought came as if he had heard Moiraine say it. <em>Your
life may depend on it. She&rsquo;s still trying to use me. Your life may
depend on it. Aes Sedai never lie.</em></p>

<p>With a groan, he rolled across the floor and kicked
open the door to his room.</p>

<p>The other room was a mass of flame. The bed was a
bonfire, red runners already crossed the floor. There would be no
crawling across that. Getting to his feet, he ran crouching into
the room, flinching from the heat, coughing, choking. Steam rose
from his damp coat. One side of the wardrobe was already burning.
He snatched open the door. His saddlebags lay inside, still
protected from the fire, one side bulging with the banner of Lews
Therin Telamon, the wooden flute case beside them. For an instant,
he hesitated. <em>I could still let it burn</em>.</p>

<p>The ceiling above him groaned. He grabbed saddlebags
and flute case and threw himself back through the door, landing on
his knees as burning timbers crashed where he had stood. Dragging
his burden, he crawled into the hall. The floor shook with more
falling beams.</p>

<p>The men with the buckets were gone when he reached
the stairs. He all but slid down the steps to the next landing,
scrambled to his feet and ran through the now-empty building into
the street. The onlookers stared at him, with his face blackened
and his coat covered with smut, but he staggered to where Loial had
propped Hurin against the wall of a house across the street. A
woman from the crowd was wiping Hurin&rsquo;s face with a cloth, but his
eyes were still closed, and his breath came in heaves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there a Wisdom nearby?&rdquo; Rand demanded. &ldquo;He needs
help.&rdquo; The woman looked at him blankly, and he tried to remember
the other names he had heard people call the women who would be
Wisdoms in the Two Rivers. &ldquo;A Wise Woman? A woman you call Mother
somebody? A woman who knows herbs and healing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a Reader, if that is what you mean,&rdquo; the woman
said, &ldquo;but all I know to do for this one is to make him
comfortable. Something is broken inside his head, I fear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand! It <em>is</em> you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stared. It was Mat, leading his horse through
the crowd, with his bow strung across his back. A Mat whose face
was pale and drawn, but still Mat, and grinning, if weakly. And
behind him came Perrin, his yellow eyes shining in the fire and
earning as many looks as the blaze. And Ingtar, dismounting in a
high-collared coat instead of armor, but still with his sword hilt
sticking up over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Rand felt a shiver run through him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late,&rdquo;
he told them. &ldquo;You came too late.&rdquo; And he sat down in the street
and began to laugh.</p>
