led them away from the Waygate at a dignified
pace, though Juin seemed more than anxious to leave the Waygate
behind. Mat, at least, looked ahead eagerly, and Hurin seemed
confident, while Loial appeared concerned more that Alar might
change her mind about his going than about anything else. Rand did
not hurry as he pulled Red along by the reins. He did not think
Verin meant to use the Stone herself.</p>

<p>The gray stone column stood upright near a beech
almost a hundred feet tall and four paces thick; Rand would have
thought it a big tree before he saw the Great Trees. There was no
warning coping here, only a few wildflowers pushing through the
leafy mulch of the forest floor. The Portal Stone itself was
weathered, but the symbols covering it were still clear enough to
make out.</p>

<p>The mounted Shienaran soldiers spread out in a loose
circle around the Stone and those afoot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We stood it upright,&rdquo; Alar said, &ldquo;when we found it
many years ago, but we did not move it. It&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;seemed to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;resist being moved.&rdquo; She went right up to it, and laid a big hand
on the Stone. &ldquo;I have always thought of it as a symbol of what has
been lost, what has been forgotten. In the Age of Legends, it could
be studied and somewhat understood. To us, it is only stone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than that, I hope.&rdquo; Verin&rsquo;s voice grew brisker.
&ldquo;Eldest, I thank you for your help. Forgive us for our lack of
ceremony in leaving you, but the Wheel waits for no woman. At least
we will no longer disturb the peace of your <em>stedding</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We called the stonemasons back from Cairhien,&rdquo; Alar
said, &ldquo;but we still hear what happens in the world Outside. False
Dragons. The Great Hunt of the Horn. We hear, and it
passes us by. I do not think Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don will pass us by, or
leave us in peace. Fare you well, Verin Sedai. All of you, fare
well, and may you shelter in the palm of the Creator&rsquo;s hand. Juin.&rdquo;
She paused only for a glance at Loial and a last admonitory look at
Rand, and then the Ogier were gone among the trees.</p>

<p>There was a creaking of saddles as the soldiers
shifted. Ingtar looked around the circle they made. &ldquo;Is this
necessary, Verin Sedai? Even if it can be done&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;We do not even
know if the Darkfriends really have taken the Horn to Toman Head. I
still believe I can make Barthanes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we cannot be sure,&rdquo; Verin said mildly, cutting
him off, &ldquo;then Toman Head is as good a place to look as any other.
More than once I&rsquo;ve heard you say you would ride to Shayol Ghul if
need be to recover the Horn. Do you hold back now, at this?&rdquo; She
gestured to the Stone under the smoothbarked tree.</p>

<p>Ingtar&rsquo;s back stiffened. &ldquo;I hold back at nothing.
Take us to Toman Head or take us to Shayol Ghul. If the Horn of
Valere lies at the end, I will follow you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is well, Ingtar. Now, Rand, you have been
transported by a Portal Stone more recently than I. Come.&rdquo; She
motioned to him, and he led Red over to her at the Stone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve used a Portal Stone?&rdquo; He glanced over his
shoulder to make sure no one else was close enough to hear. &ldquo;Then
you don&rsquo;t mean for me to.&rdquo; He gave a relieved shrug.</p>

<p>Verin looked at him blandly. &ldquo;I have never used a
Stone; that is why your use is more recent than mine. I am well
aware of my limits. I would be destroyed before I came close to
channeling enough Power to work a Portal Stone. But I know a little
of them. Enough to help you, a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know <em>anything</em>.&rdquo; He led his
horse around the Stone, looking it up and down. &ldquo;The one thing I
remember is the symbol for our world. Selene showed me, but I don&rsquo;t
see it here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not. Not on a Stone in our world; the
symbols are aids in getting to a world.&rdquo; She shook her head. &ldquo;What
would I not give to talk with this girl of yours? Or better, to put
my hands on her book. It is generally thought that no copy of <em>
Mirrors of the Wheel</em> survived the Breaking whole. Serafelle
always tells me there are more books that we believe lost than I
could credit waiting to be found. Well, no use in worrying over
what I don&rsquo;t know. I do know some things. The symbols on the top
half of the Stone stand for worlds. Not all the Worlds That Might
Be, of course. Apparently, not every Stone connects to every world,
and the Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends believed that there were
possible worlds no Stones at all touched. Do you see nothing that
sparks a memory?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; If he found the right symbol, he could use
it to find Fain and the Horn, to save Mat, to stop Fain hurting
Emond&rsquo;s Field. If he found the symbol, he would have to touch <em>
saidin</em>. He wanted to save Mat and stop Fain, but the did not
want to touch <em>saidin</em>. He was afraid to channel, and he
hungered for it like a starving man for food. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember
anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verin sighed. &ldquo;The symbols at the bottom indicate
Stones at other places. If you know the trick of it, you could take
us, not to this same Stone in another world, but to one of those
others there, or even to one of them here. It was something akin to
Traveling, I think, but just as no one remembers how to Travel, no
one remembers the trick. Without that knowledge, trying it might
easily destroy us all.&rdquo; She pointed to two parallel wavy lines
crossed by an odd squiggle, carved low on the column. &ldquo;That
indicates a Stone on Toman Head. It is one of three Stones for
which I know the symbol; the only one of those three I&rsquo;ve visited.
And what I learned&mdash;after nearly being caught by the snows in
the Mountains of Mist and freezing my way across Almoth Plain&mdash;was absolutely nothing. Do you play at dice, or cards, Rand
al&rsquo;Thor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat&rsquo;s the gambler. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Well, we&rsquo;ll leave him out of this, I think.
These other symbols are also known to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With one finger she outlined a rectangle containing
eight carvings that were much alike, a circle and an arrow, but in
half the arrow was contained inside the circle, while in the others
the point pierced the circle through. The arrows pointed left,
right, up and down, and surrounding each circle was a different
line of what Rand was sure was script, though in no language he
knew, all curving lines that suddenly became jagged hooks, then
flowed on again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least,&rdquo; Verin went on, &ldquo;I know this much about
them. Each stands for a world, the study of which led eventually to
the making of the Ways. These are not all of the worlds studied,
but the only ones for which I know the symbols. This is where
gambling comes in. I don&rsquo;t know what any of these worlds is like.
It is believed there are worlds where a year is only a day here,
and others where a day is a year here. There are supposed to be
worlds where the very air would kill us at a breath, and worlds
that barely have enough reality to hold together. I would not
speculate on what might happen if we found ourselves in one of
those. You must choose. As my father would have said, it&rsquo;s time to
roll the dice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stared, shaking his head. &ldquo;I could kill all of
us, whatever I choose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you not willing to take that risk? For the Horn
of Valere? For Mat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you so willing to take it? I don&rsquo;t even know
if I can do it. It&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t work every time I try.&rdquo; He
knew no one had come any closer, but he looked anyway. All of them
waited in a loose circle around the Stone, watching, but not close
enough to eavesdrop. &ldquo;Sometimes <em>saidin</em> is just there. I
can feel it, but it might as well be on the moon as far as touching
it. And even if it does work, what if I take us someplace we can&rsquo;t
breathe? What good will that do Mat? Or the Horn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are the Dragon Reborn,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;Oh,
you can die, but I don&rsquo;t think the Pattern will let you die until
it is done with you. Then again, the Shadow lies on the Pattern,
now, and who can say how that affects the weaving? All you can do
is follow your destiny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Rand al&rsquo;Thor,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;I am not the Dragon
Reborn. I won&rsquo;t be a false Dragon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are what you are. Will you choose, or will you
stand here until your friend dies?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand heard his teeth grinding and forced himself to
unclench his jaw. The symbols could all have been exactly alike,
for all they meant to him. The script could as well have been a
chicken&rsquo;s scratchings. At last he settled on one, with an arrow
pointing left because it pointed toward Toman Head, an arrow that
pierced the circle because it had broken free, as he wanted to. He
wanted to laugh. Such small things on which to gamble all their
lives.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come closer,&rdquo; Verin ordered the others. &ldquo;It will be
best if you are near.&rdquo; They obeyed, with only a little hesitation.
&ldquo;It is time to begin,&rdquo; she said as they gathered round.</p>

<p>She threw back her cloak and put her hands on the
column, but Rand saw her watching him from the corner of her eye.
He was aware of nervous coughing and throat-clearing from the men
around the Stone, a curse from Uno at someone hanging back, a weak
joke from Mat, a loud gulp from Loial. He took the void.</p>

<p>It was so easy, now. The flame consumed fear and
passion and was gone almost before he thought to form it. Gone,
leaving only emptiness, and shining <em>saidin</em>, sickening,
tantalizing, stomach-turning, seductive. He&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;reached for it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and it filled him, made him alive. He did not move a muscle,
but he felt as if he were quivering with the rush of the One Power
into him. The symbol formed itself, an arrow piercing a circle,
floating just beyond the void, as hard as the stuff it was carved
on. He let the One Power flow through him to the symbol.</p>

<p>The symbol shimmered, flickered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something is happening,&rdquo; Verin said. &ldquo;Something&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The world flickered.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The iron lock spun across the farmhouse floor, and
Rand dropped the hot teakettle as a huge figure with ram&rsquo;s horns on
its head loomed in the doorway with the darkness of Winternight
behind it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run!&rdquo; Tam shouted. His sword flashed, and the
Trolloc toppled, but it grappled with Tam as it fell, pulling him
down.</p>

<p>More crowded in at the door, black-mailed shapes with
human faces distorted with muzzles and beaks and horns, oddly
curved swords stabbing at Tam as he tried to struggle to his feet,
spiked axes swinging, red blood on steel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; Rand screamed. Clawing his belt knife from
its sheath, he threw himself over the table to help his father, and
screamed again as the first sword ran through his chest.</p>

<p>Blood bubbled up into his mouth, and a voice
whispered inside his head, <em>I have won again, Lews
Therin</em>.</p>

<p><em>Flicker</em>.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Rand struggled to hold the symbol, dimly aware of
Verin&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;is not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Power flooded.</p>

<p><em>Flicker</em>.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Rand was happy after he married Egwene, and tried to
not let the moods take him, the times when he thought there should
have been something more, something different. News of the world
outside came into the Two Rivers with peddlers, and merchants come
to buy wool and tabac, always news of fresh troubles, of wars and
false Dragons everywhere. There was a year when neither merchants
nor peddlers came, and when they returned the next they brought
word that Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s armies had come back, or their
descendants, at least. The old nations were broken, it was said,
and the world&rsquo;s new masters, who used chained Aes Sedai in their
battles, had torn down the White Tower and salted the ground where
Tar Valon had stood. There were no more Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>It all made little difference in the Two Rivers.
Crops still had to be planted, sheep sheared, lambs tended. Tam had
grandsons and granddaughters to dandle on his knee before he was
laid to rest beside his wife, and the old farmhouse grew new rooms.
Egwene became Wisdom, and most thought she was even better than the
old Wisdom, Nynaeve al&rsquo;Maera, had been. It was as well she was, for
her cures that worked so miraculously on others were only just able
to keep Rand alive from the sickness that constantly seemed to
threaten him. His moods grew worse, blacker, and he raged that this
was not what was meant to be. Egwene grew frightened when the moods
were on him, for strange things sometimes happened when he was at
his bleakest&mdash;lightning storms she had not heard listening to
the wind, wildfires in the forest&mdash;but she loved him and
cared for him and kept him sane, though some muttered that Rand
al&rsquo;Thor was crazy and dangerous.</p>

<p>When she died, he sat alone for long hours by her
grave, tears soaking his gray-flecked beard. His sickness came
back, and he wasted; he lost the last two fingers on his right hand
and one on his left, his ears looked like scars, and men muttered
that he smelled of decay. His blackness deepened.</p>

<p>Yet when the dire news came, none refused to accept
him at their side. Trollocs and Fades and things undreamed of had
burst out of the Blight, and the world&rsquo;s new masters were being
thrown back, for all the powers they wielded. So Rand took up the
bow he had just fingers enough left to shoot and limped with those
who marched north to the River Taren, men from every village, farm,
and corner of the Two Rivers, with their bows, and axes, and
boarspears, and swords that had lain rusting in attics. Rand wore a
sword, too, with a heron on the blade, that he had found after Tam
died, though he knew nothing of how to use it. Women came, too,
shouldering what weapons they could find, marching alongside the
men. Some laughed, saying that they had the strange feeling they
had done this before.</p>

<p>And at the Taren the people of the Two Rivers met the
invaders, endless ranks of Trollocs led by nightmare Fades beneath
a dead black banner that seemed to eat the light. Rand saw that
banner and thought the madness had taken him again, for it seemed
that this was what he had been born for, to fight that banner. He
sent every arrow at it, straight as his skill and the void would
serve, never worrying about the Trollocs forcing their way across
the river, or the men and women dying to either side of him. It was
one of those Trollocs that ran him through, before it loped howling
for blood deeper into the Two Rivers. And as he lay on the bank of
the Taren, watching the sky seem to grow dark at noon, breath
coming ever slower, he heard a voice say, <em>I have won again,
Lews Therin</em>.</p>

<p><em>Flicker</em>.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The arrow-and-circle contorted into parallel wavy
lines, and he fought it back again.</p>

<p>Verin&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;right. Something&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Power raged.</p>

<p><em>Flicker</em>.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Tam tried to console Rand when Egwene took sick and
died just a week before their wedding. Nynaeve tried, too, but she
was shaken herself, since for all her skill she had no idea what it
was that had killed the girl. Rand had sat outside Egwene&rsquo;s house
while she died, and there seemed to be nowhere in Emond&rsquo;s Field he
could go that he did not still hear her screaming. He knew he could
not stay. Tam gave him a sword with a heron-mark blade, and though
he explained little of how a shepherd in the Two Rivers had come by
such a thing, he taught Rand how to use it. On the day Rand left,
Tam gave him a letter he said might get Rand taken into the army of
Illian, and hugged him, and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had another son, or
wanted another. Come back with a wife like I did, if you can, boy,
but come back in any case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand had his money stolen in Baerlon, though, and his
letter of introduction, and almost his sword, and he met a woman
called Min who told him such crazy things about himself that he
finally left the city to get away from her. Eventually his
wanderings brought him to Caemlyn, and there his skill with the
sword earned him a place in the Queen&rsquo;s Guards. Sometimes he found
himself looking at the Daughter-Heir, Elayne, and at such times he
was filled with odd thoughts that this was not the way things were
supposed to be, that there should be something more to his life.
Elayne did not look at him, of course; she married a Tairen prince,
though she did not seem happy in it. Rand was just a soldier, once
a shepherd from a small village so far toward the western border
that only lines on a map any longer truly connected it to Andor.
Besides, he had a dark reputation, as a man of violent moods.</p>

<p>Some said he was mad, and in ordinary times perhaps
not even his skill with the sword would have kept him in the Guard,
but these were not ordinary times. False Dragons sprang up like
weeds. Every time one was taken down, two more proclaimed
themselves, or three, till every nation was torn by war. And Rand&rsquo;s
star rose, for he had learned the secret of his madness, a secret
he knew he had to keep and did. He could channel. There were always
places, times, in a battle when a little channeling, not big enough
to be noticed in the confusion, could make luck. Sometimes it
worked, this channeling, and sometimes not, but it worked often
enough. He knew he was mad, and did not care. A wasting sickness
came on him, and he did not care about that, either, and neither
did anyone else, for word had come that Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s armies had
returned to reclaim the land.</p>

<p>Rand led a thousand men when the Queen&rsquo;s Guards
crossed the Mountains of Mist&mdash;he never thought of turning
aside to visit the Two Rivers; he seldom thought of the Two Rivers
at all, anymore&mdash;and he commanded the Guard when the
shattered remnants retreated back across the mountains. The length
of Andor he fought and fell back, amid hordes of fleeing refugees,
until at last he came to Caemlyn. Many of the people of Caemlyn had
fled already, and many counseled the army to retreat further, but
Elayne was Queen, now, and vowed she would not leave Caemlyn. She
would not look at his ruined face, scarred by his sickness, but he
could not leave her, and so what was left of the Queen&rsquo;s Guards
prepared to defend the Queen while her people ran.</p>

<p>The Power came to him during the battle for Caemlyn,
and he hurled lightning and fire among the invaders, and split the
earth under their feet, yet the feeling came again, too, that he
had been born for something else. For all he did, there were too
many of the enemy to stop, and they also had those who could
channel. At last, a lightning bolt hurled Rand from the Palace
wall, broken, bleeding, and burned, and as his last breath rattled
in his throat, he heard a voice whisper, <em>I have won again, Lews
Therin</em>.</p>

<p><em>Flicker</em>.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Rand struggled to hold the void as it quivered under
the hammer blows of the world flickering, to hold the one symbol as
a thousand of them darted along the surface of the void. He
struggled to hold on to any one symbol.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;is wrong!&rdquo; Verin screamed.</p>

<p>The Power was everything.</p>

<p><em>Flicker. Flicker. Flicker. Flicker. Flicker.
Flicker</em>.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">He was a soldier. He was a shepherd. He was a beggar,
and a king. He was farmer, gleeman, sailor, carpenter. He was born,
lived, and died an Aiel. He died mad, he died rotting, he died of
sickness, accident, age. He was executed, and multitudes cheered
his death. He proclaimed himself the Dragon Reborn and flung his
banner across the sky; he ran from the Power and hid; he lived and
died never knowing. He held off the madness and the sickness for
years; he succumbed between two winters. Sometimes Moiraine came
and took him away from the Two Rivers, alone or with those of his
friends who had survived Winternight; sometimes she did not.
Sometimes other Aes Sedai came for him. Sometimes the Red Ajah.
Egwene married him; Egwene, stern-faced in the stole of the Amyrlin
Seat, led the Aes Sedai who gentled him; Egwene, with tears in her
eyes, plunged a dagger into his heart, and he thanked her as he
died. He loved other women, married other women. Elayne, and Min,
and a fair-haired farmer&rsquo;s daughter met on the road to Caemlyn, and
women he had never seen before he lived those lives. A hundred
lives. More. So many he could not count them. And at the end of
every life, as he lay dying, as he drew his final breath, a voice
whispered in his ear, <em>I have won again, Lews Therin.</em></p>

<p><em>Flicker flicker flicker flicker flicker flicker flicker
flicker flicker flicker flicker flicker flicker flicker flicker
flicker flicker flicker flicker flicker flicker flicker flicker
flicker flicker flicker</em>.</p>

<p>The void vanished, contact with <em>saidin</em> fled,
and Rand fell with a thud that would have knocked the breath out of
him if he had not already been half numb. He felt rough stone under
his cheek, and his hands. It was cold.</p>

<p>He was aware of Verin, struggling from her back to
hands and knees. He heard someone vomit roughly, and raised his
head. Uno was kneeling on the ground, scrubbing the back of his
hand across his mouth. Everyone was down, and the horses stood
stiff-legged and quivering, eyes wild and rolling. Ingtar had his
sword out, gripping the hilt so hard the blade shook, staring at
nothing. Loial sat sprawled, wide-eyed and stunned. Mat was huddled
in a ball with his arms wrapped around his head, and Perrin had his
fingers dug into his face as if he wanted to rip away whatever he
had seen, or perhaps rip out the eyes that had seen it. None of the
soldiers were any better. Masema wept openly, tears streaming down
his face, and Hurin was looking around as if for a place to
run.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; Rand stopped to swallow. He was lying
on rough, weathered stone half buried in the dirt. &ldquo;What
happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A surge of the One Power.&rdquo; The Aes Sedai tottered to
her feet and pulled her cloak tight with a shiver. &ldquo;It was as if we
were being forced&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;pushed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;It seemed to come out of
nowhere. You must learn to control it. You must! That much of the
Power could burn you to a cinder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Verin, I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I lived&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He
realized the stone under him was rounded. The Portal Stone.
Hastily, shakily, he pushed himself to his feet. &ldquo;Verin, I lived
and died, I don&rsquo;t know how many times. Every time it was different,
but it was me. It was me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Lines that join the Worlds That Might Be, laid
by those who knew the Numbers of Chaos.&rdquo; Verin shuddered; she
seemed to be talking to herself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard it, but there is
no reason we would not be born in those worlds, yet the lives we
lived would be different lives. Of course. Different lives for the
different ways things might have happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that what happened? I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;we&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;saw how our
lives could have been?&rdquo; <em>I have won again, Lews Therin. No! I am
Rand al&rsquo;Thor!</em></p>

<p>Verin gave herself a shake and looked at him. &ldquo;Does
it surprise you that your life might go differently if you made
different choices, or different things happened to you? Though I
never thought I&mdash;Well. The important thing is, we are here.
Though not as we hoped.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is here?&rdquo; he demanded. The woods of Stedding
Tsofu were gone, replaced by rolling land. There seemed to be
forest not far to the west, and a few hills. It had been high in
the day when they gathered around the Stone in the <em>
stedding</em> but here the sun stood low toward afternoon in a gray
sky. The handful of trees nearby were bare branched, or else held a
few leaves bright with color. A cold wind gusted from the east,
sending leaves scurrying across the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Toman Head,&rdquo; Verin said. &ldquo;This is the Stone I
visited. You should not have tried to bring us directly here. I
don&rsquo;t know what went wrong&mdash;I don&rsquo;t suppose I ever will&mdash;but from the trees, I would say it is well into late autumn.
Rand, we haven&rsquo;t gained any time by it. We&rsquo;ve lost time. I would
say we have easily spent four months in coming here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must let me guide you in these things. I cannot
teach you, it&rsquo;s true, but perhaps I can at least keep you from
killing yourself&mdash;and the rest of us&mdash;by overreaching.
Even if you do not kill yourself, if the Dragon Reborn burns
himself out like a guttering candle, who will face the Dark One
then?&rdquo; She did not wait for him to renew his protests, but went to
Ingtar instead.</p>

<p>The Shienaran gave a start when she touched his arm,
and looked at her with frantic eyes. &ldquo;I walk in the Light,&rdquo; he said
hoarsely. &ldquo;I will find the Horn of Valere and pull down Shayol
Ghul&rsquo;s power. <em>I will!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you will,&rdquo; she said soothingly. She took
his face in her hands, and he drew a sudden breath, abruptly
recovering from whatever had held him. Except that memory still lay
in his eyes. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That will do for you. I will see
how I can help the rest. We may still recover the Horn, but our
path has not grown smoother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she started around among the others, stopping
briefly by each, Rand went to his friends. When he tried to
straighten Mat, Mat jerked and stared at him, then grabbed Rand&rsquo;s
coat with both hands. &ldquo;Rand, I&rsquo;d never tell anyone about&mdash;about you. I wouldn&rsquo;t betray you. You have to believe that!&rdquo; He
looked worse than ever, but Rand thought it was mostly fright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Rand said. He wondered what lives Mat had
lived, and what he had done. <em>He must have told someone, or he
wouldn&rsquo;t be so anxious about it</em>. He could not hold it against
him. Those had been other Mats, not this one. Besides, after some
of the alternatives he had seen for himself&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;I believe you.
Perrin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The curly-haired youth dropped his hands from his
face with a sigh. Red marks scored his forehead and cheeks where
his nails had dug in. His yellow eyes hid his thoughts. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
have many choices really, do we, Rand? Whatever happens, whatever
we do, some things are almost always the same.&rdquo; He let out another
long breath. &ldquo;Where are we? Is this one of those worlds you and
Hurin were talking about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Toman Head,&rdquo; Rand told him. &ldquo;In our world. Or
so Verin says. And it is autumn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat looked worried. &ldquo;How could&mdash;? No, I don&rsquo;t
want to know how it happened. But how are we going to find Fain and
the dagger now? He could be anywhere by this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; Rand assured him. He hoped he was right.
Fain had had time to take ship for anyplace he wanted to go. Time
to ride to Emond&rsquo;s Field. Or Tar Valon. <em>Please, Light, he
didn&rsquo;t get tired of waiting. If he&rsquo;s hurt Egwene, or anybody in
Emond&rsquo;s Field, I&rsquo;ll</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Light burn me, I tried to come
in time</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The larger towns on Toman Head are all west of
here,&rdquo; Verin announced loudly enough for all to hear. Everyone was
on their feet again, except for Rand and his two friends; she came
and put her hands on Mat as she spoke. &ldquo;Not that there are many
villages large enough to call towns. If we are to find any trace of
the Darkfriends, to the west is the place to begin. And I think we
should not waste the daylight sitting here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Mat blinked and stood up&mdash;he still looked
ill, but he moved spryly&mdash;she put her hands on Perrin. Rand
backed away when she reached for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish,&rdquo; she told him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want your help,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;Or any
Aes Sedai help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her lips twitched. &ldquo;As you wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They mounted immediately and rode west, leaving the
Portal Stone behind. No one protested, Rand least of all. <em>
Light, let me not be too late</em>.</p>
