<p class="prophecy">It shall come to pass that what men made shall be
shattered, and the Shadow shall lie across the Pattern of the Age,
and the Dark One shall once more lay his hand upon the world of
man. Women shall weep and men quail as the nations of the earth are
rent like rotting cloth. Neither shall anything stand nor abide&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="prophecy">Yet one shall be born to face the Shadow, born
once more as he was born before and shall be born again, time
without end. The Dragon shall be Reborn, and there shall be wailing
and gnashing of teeth at his rebirth. In sackcloth and ashes shall
he clothe the people, and he shall break the world again by his
coming, tearing apart all ties that bind. Like the unfettered dawn
shall he blind us, and burn us, yet shall the Dragon Reborn
confront the Shadow at the Last Battle, and his blood shall give us
the Light. Let tears flow, O ye people of the world. Weep for your
salvation.</p>

<h4><em>In the Shadow</em></h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
man who called himself Bors, at least in this
place, sneered at the low murmuring that rolled around the vaulted
chamber like the soft gabble of geese. His grimace was hidden by
the black silk mask that covered his face, though, just like the
masks that covered the hundred other faces in the chamber. A
hundred black masks, and a hundred pairs of eyes trying to see what
lay behind them.</p>

<p>If one did not look too closely, the huge room could
have been in a palace, with its tall marble fireplaces and its
golden lamps hanging from the domed ceiling, its colorful
tapestries and intricately patterned mosaic floor. If one did not
look too closely. The fireplaces were cold, for one thing. Flames
danced on logs as thick as a man&rsquo;s leg, but gave no heat. The walls
behind the tapestries, the ceiling high above the lamps, were
undressed stone, almost black. There were no windows, and only two
doorways, one at either end of the room. It was as if someone had
intended to give the semblance of a palace reception chamber but
had not cared enough to bother with more than the outline and a few
touches for detail.</p>

<p>Where the chamber was, the man who called himself
Bors did not know, nor did he think any of the others knew. He did
not like to think about where it might be. It was enough that he
had been summoned. He did not like to think about that, either, but
for such a summons, even he came.</p>

<p>He shifted his cloak, thankful that the fires were
cold, else it would have been too hot for the black wool draping
him to the floor. All his clothes were black. The bulky folds of
the cloak hid the stoop he used to disguise his height, and bred
confusion as to whether he was thin or thick. He was not the only
one there enveloped in a tailor&rsquo;s span of cloth.</p>

<p>Silently he watched his companions. Patience had
marked much of his life. Always, if he waited and watched long
enough, someone made a mistake. Most of the men and women here
might have had the same philosophy; they watched, and listened
silently to those who had to speak. Some people could not bear
waiting, or silence, and so gave away more than they knew.</p>

<p>Servants circulated through the guests, slender,
golden-haired youths proffering wine with a bow and a wordless
smile. Young men and young women alike, they wore tight white
breeches and flowing white shirts. And male and female alike, they
moved with disturbing grace. Each looked more than a mirror image
of the others, the boys as handsome as the girls were beautiful. He
doubted he could distinguish one from another, and he had an eye
and a memory for faces.</p>

<p>A smiling, white-clad girl offered her tray of
crystal goblets to him. He took one with no intention of drinking;
it might appear untrusting&mdash;or worse, and either could be
deadly here&mdash;if he refused altogether, but anything could be
slipped into a drink. Surely some among his companions would have
no objections to seeing the number of their rivals for power
dwindle, whomever the unlucky ones happened to be.</p>

<p>Idly he wondered whether the servants would have to
be disposed of after this meeting. <em>Servants hear
everything</em>. As the serving girl straightened from her bow, his
eye caught hers above that sweet smile. Blank eyes. Empty eyes. A
doll&rsquo;s eyes. Eyes more dead than death.</p>

<p>He shivered as she moved gracefully away, and raised
the goblet to his lips before he caught himself. It was not what
had been done to the girl that chilled him. Rather, every time he
thought he detected a weakness in those he now served, he found
himself preceded, the supposed weakness cut out with a ruthless
precision that left him amazed. And worried. The first rule of his
life had always been to search for weakness, for every weakness was
a chink where he could probe and pry and influence. If his current
masters, his masters for the moment, had no weakness&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frowning behind his mask, he studied his companions.
At least there was plenty of weakness there. Their nervousness
betrayed them, even those who had sense enough to guard their
tongues. A stiffness in the way this one held himself, a jerkiness
in the way that one handled her skirts.</p>

<p>A good quarter of them, he estimated, had not
bothered with disguise beyond the black masks. Their clothes told
much. A woman standing before a gold-and-crimson wall hanging,
speaking softly to a figure&mdash;impossible to say whether it was
man or woman&mdash;cloaked and hooded in gray. She had obviously
chosen the spot because the colors of the tapestry set off her
garb. Doubly foolish to draw attention to herself, for her scarlet
dress, cut low in the bodice to show too much flesh and high at the
hem to display golden slippers, marked her from Illian, and a woman
of wealth, perhaps even of noble blood.</p>

<p>Not far beyond the Illianer, another woman stood,
alone and admirably silent. With a swan&rsquo;s neck and lustrous black
hair falling in waves below her waist, she kept her back to the
stone wall, observing everything. No nervousness there, only serene
self-possession. Very admirable, that, but her coppery skin and her
creamy, high-necked gown&mdash;leaving nothing but her hands
uncovered, yet clinging and only just barely opaque, so that it
hinted at everything and revealed nothing&mdash;marked her just as
clearly of the first blood of Arad Doman. And unless the man who
called himself Bors missed his guess entirely, the wide golden
bracelet on her left wrist bore her House symbols. They would be
for her own House; no Domani bloodborn would bend her stiff pride
enough to wear the sigils of another House. Worse than
foolishness.</p>

<p>A man in a high-collared, sky-blue Shienaran coat
passed him with a wary, head-to-toe glance though the eyeholes of
his mask. The man&rsquo;s carriage named him soldier; the set of his
shoulders, the way his gaze never rested in one place for long, and
the way his hand seemed ready to dart for a sword that was not
there, all proclaimed it. The Shienaran wasted little time on the
man who called himself Bors; stooped shoulders and a bent back held
no threat.</p>

<p>The man who called himself Bors snorted as the
Shienaran moved on, right hand clenching and eyes already studying
elsewhere for danger. He could read them all, to class and country.
Merchant and warrior, commoner and noble. From Kandor and Cairhien,
Saldaea and Ghealdan. From every nation and nearly every people.
His nose wrinkled in sudden disgust. Even a Tinker, in bright green
breeches and a virulent yellow coat. <em>We can do without</em> those
<em>come the Day</em>.</p>

<p>The disguised ones were no better, many of them,
cloaked and shrouded as they were. He caught sight, under the edge
of one dark robe, of the silver-worked boots of a High Lord of
Tear, and under another a glimpse of golden lion-head spurs, worn
only by high officers in the Andoran Queen&rsquo;s Guards. A slender
fellow&mdash;slender even in a floor-dragging black robe and an anonymous
gray cloak caught with a plain silver pin&mdash;watched from the shadows
of his deep cowl. He could be anyone, from anywhere&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;except
for the six-pointed star tattooed on the web between thumb and
forefinger of his right hand. One of the Sea Folk then, and a look
at his left hand would show the marks of his clan and line. The man
who called himself Bors did not bother to try.</p>

<p>Suddenly his eyes narrowed, fixing on a woman
enveloped in black till nothing showed but her fingers. On her
right hand rested a gold ring in the shape of a serpent eating its
own tail. Aes Sedai, or at least a woman trained in Tar Valon by
Aes Sedai. None else would wear that ring. Either way made no
difference to him. He looked away before she could notice his
watching, and almost immediately he spotted another woman swathed
from head to toe in black and wearing a Great Serpent ring. The two
witches gave no sign that they knew each other. In the White Tower
they sat like spiders in the middle of a web, pulling the strings
that made kings and queens dance, meddling. <em>Curse them all to
death eternal!</em> He realized that he was grinding his teeth. If
numbers must dwindle&mdash;and they must, before the Day&mdash;there were some who would be missed even less than Tinkers.</p>

<p>A chime sounded, a single, shivering note that came
from everywhere at once and cut off all other sounds like a
knife.</p>

<p>The tall doors at the far end of the chamber swung
open, and two Trollocs stepped into the room, spikes decorating the
black mail that hung to their knees. Everyone shied back. Even the
man who called himself Bors.</p>

<p>Head and shoulders taller than the tallest man there,
they were a stomach-turning blend of man and animal, human faces
twisted and altered. One had a heavy, pointed beak where his mouth
and nose should have been, and feathers covered his head instead of
hair. The other walked on hooves, his face pushed out in a hairy
muzzle, and goat horns stuck up above his ears.</p>

<p>Ignoring the humans, the Trollocs turned back toward
the door and bowed, servile and cringing. The feathers on the one
lifted in a tight crest.</p>

<p>A Myrddraal stepped between them, and they fell to
their knees. It was garbed in black that made the Trollocs&rsquo; mail
and the humans&rsquo; masks seem bright, garments that hung still,
without a ripple, as it moved with a viper&rsquo;s grace.</p>

<p>The man who called himself Bors felt his lips drawing
back over his teeth, half snarl and half, he was shamed to admit
even to himself, fear. It had its face uncovered. Its pasty pale
face, a man&rsquo;s face, but eyeless as an egg, like a maggot in a
grave.</p>

<p>The smooth white face swiveled, regarding them all
one by one, it seemed. A visible shiver ran through them under that
eyeless look. Thin, bloodless lips quirked in what might almost
have been a smile as, one by one, the masked ones tried to press
back into the crowd, milling to avoid that gaze. The Myrddraal&rsquo;s
look shaped them into a semicircle facing the door.</p>

<p>The man who called himself Bors swallowed. <em>There
will come a day, Halfman. When the Great Lord of the Dark comes
again, he will choose his new Dreadlords, and you will cower before
them. You will cower before men. Before me! Why doesn&rsquo;t it speak?
Stop staring at me, and speak!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Master comes.&rdquo; The Myrddraal&rsquo;s voice rasped
like a dry snake skin crumbling. &ldquo;To your bellies, worms! Grovel,
lest his brilliance blind and burn you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rage filled the man who called himself Bors, at the
tone as much as the words, but then the air above the Halfman
shimmered, and the import drove home. <em>It can&rsquo;t be! It can&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!</em> The Trollocs were already on their bellies, writhing as if
they wanted to burrow into the floor.</p>

<p>Without waiting to see if anyone else moved, the man
who called himself Bors dropped facedown, grunting as he bruised
himself on the stone. Words sprang to his lips like a charm against
danger&mdash;they were a charm, though a thin reed against what he
feared&mdash;and he heard a hundred other voices, breathy with
fear, speaking the same against the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Great Lord of the Dark is my Master, and most
heartily do I serve him to the last shred of my very soul.&rdquo; In the
back of his mind a voice chattered with fear<em>. The Dark One and
all the Forsaken are bound&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</em>Shivering, he forced it to
silence. He had abandoned that voice long since. &ldquo;Lo, my Master is
death&rsquo;s Master. Asking nothing do I serve against the Day of his
coming, yet do I serve in the sure and certain hope of life
everlasting.&rdquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>bound in Shayol Ghul, bound by the Creator
at the moment of creation. No, I serve a different master now.</em>
&ldquo;Surely the faithful shall be exalted in the land, exalted above
the unbelievers; exalted above thrones, yet do I serve humbly
against the Day of his Return.&rdquo; <em>The hand of the Creator
shelters us all, and the Light protects us from the Shadow. No, no!
A different master</em>. &ldquo;Swift come the Day of Return. Swift come
the Great Lord of the Dark to guide us and rule the world forever
and ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man who called himself Bors finished the creed
panting, as if he had run ten miles. The rasp of breath all around
told him he was not the only one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rise. All of you, rise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mellifluous voice took him by surprise. Surely
none of his companions, lying on their bellies with their masked
faces pressed to the mosaic tiles, would have spoken, but it was
not the voice he expected from&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Cautiously, he raised his head
enough to see with one eye.</p>

<p>The figure of a man floated in the air above the
Myrddraal, the hem of his blood-red robe hanging a span over the
Halfman&rsquo;s head. Masked in blood-red, too. Would the Great Lord of
the Dark appear to them as a man? And masked, besides? Yet the
Myrddraal, its very gaze fear, trembled and almost cowered where it
stood in the figure&rsquo;s shadow. The man who called himself Bors
grasped for an answer his mind could contain without splitting. One
of the Forsaken, perhaps.</p>

<p>That thought was only a little less painful. Even so,
it meant the Day of the Dark One&rsquo;s return must be close at hand if
one of the Forsaken was free. The Forsaken, thirteen of the most
powerful wielders of the One Power in an Age filled with powerful
wielders, had been sealed up in Shayol Ghul along with the Dark
One, sealed away from the world of men by the Dragon and the
Hundred Companions. And the backblast of that sealing had tainted
the male half of the True Source; and all the male Aes Sedai, those
cursed wielders of the Power, went mad and broke the world, tore it
apart like a pottery bowl smashed on rocks, ending the Age of
Legends before they died, rotting while they still lived. A fitting
death for Aes Sedai, to his mind. Too good for them. He regretted
only that the women had been spared.</p>

<p>Slowly, painfully, he forced the panic to the back of
his mind, confined it and held it tight though it screamed to get
out. It was the best he could do. None of those on their bellies
had risen, and only a few had even dared raise their heads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rise.&rdquo; There was a snap in the red-masked
figure&rsquo;s voice this time. He gestured with both hands.
&ldquo;Stand!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man who called himself Bors scrambled up
awkwardly, but halfway to his feet, he hesitated. Those gesturing
hands were horribly burned, crisscrossed by black fissures, the raw
flesh between as red as the figure&rsquo;s robes. <em>Would the Dark One
appear so? Or even one of the Forsaken?</em> The eyeholes of that
blood-red mask swept slowly across him, and he straightened
hastily. He thought he could feel the heat of an open furnace in
that gaze.</p>

<p>The others obeyed the command with no more grace and
no less fear in their rising. When all were on their feet, the
floating figure spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been known by many names, but the one by
which you shall know me is Ba&rsquo;alzamon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man who called himself Bors clamped his teeth to
keep them from chattering. Ba&rsquo;alzamon. In the Trolloc tongue, it
meant Heart of the Dark, and even unbelievers knew it was the
Trolloc name for the Great Lord of the Dark, He Whose Name Must
Not Be Uttered. Not the True Name, Shai&rsquo;tan, but still
forbidden. Among those gathered here, and others of their
kind, to sully either with a human tongue was blasphemy. His breath
whistled through his nostrils, and all around him he could hear
others panting behind their masks. The servants were gone, and the
Trollocs as well, though he had not seen them go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The place where you stand lies in the shadow of
Shayol Ghul.&rdquo; More than one voice moaned at that; the man who
called himself Bors was not sure his own was not among them. A
touch of what might almost be called mockery entered Ba&rsquo;alzamon&rsquo;s
voice as he spread his arms wide. &ldquo;Fear not, for the Day of your
Master&rsquo;s rising upon the world is near at hand. The Day of Return
draws nigh. Does it not tell you so that I am here, to be seen by
you favored few among your brothers and sisters? Soon the Wheel of
Time will be broken. Soon the Great Serpent will die, and with the
power of that death, the death of Time itself, your Master will
remake the world in his own image for this Age and for all Ages to
come. And those who serve me, faithful and steadfast, will sit at
my feet above the stars in the sky and rule the world of men
forever. So have I promised, and so shall it be, without end. You
shall live and rule forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A murmur of anticipation ran through the listeners,
and some even took a step forward, toward the floating, crimson
shape, their eyes lifted, rapturous. Even the man who called
himself Bors felt the pull of that promise, the promise for which
he had dealt away his soul a hundred times over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Day of Return comes closer,&rdquo; Ba&rsquo;alzamon said.
&ldquo;But there is much yet to do. Much to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The air to Ba&rsquo;alzamon&rsquo;s left shimmered and thickened,
and the figure of a young man hung there, a little lower than
Ba&rsquo;alzamon. The man who called himself Bors could not decide
whether it was a living being or not. A country lad, by his
clothes, with a light of mischief in his brown eyes and the hint of
a smile on his lips, as if in memory or anticipation of a prank.
The flesh looked warm, but the chest did not move with breath, the
eyes did not blink.</p>

<p>The air to Ba&rsquo;alzamon&rsquo;s right wavered as if with
heat, and a second country-clad figure hung suspended a little
below Ba&rsquo;alzamon. A curly-haired youth, as heavily muscled as a
blacksmith. And an oddity: a battle axe hung at his side, a great,
steel half-moon balanced by a thick spike. The man who called
himself Bors suddenly leaned forward, intent on an even greater
strangeness. A youth with yellow eyes.</p>

<p>For the third time air solidified into the shape of a
young man, this time directly under Ba&rsquo;alzamon&rsquo;s eye, almost at his
feet. A tall fellow, with eyes now gray, now almost blue as the
light took them, and dark, reddish hair. Another villager, or
farmer. The man who called himself Bors gasped. Yet another thing
out of the ordinary, though he wondered why he should expect
anything to be ordinary here. A sword swung from the figure&rsquo;s belt,
a sword with a bronze heron on the scabbard and another inset into
the long, two-handed hilt. <em>A</em> village boy <em>with a heron-mark
blade? Impossible! What can it mean? And a boy with</em> yellow
<em>eyes.</em> He noticed the Myrddraal looking at the figures,
trembling; and unless he misjudged entirely, its trembling was no
longer fear, but hatred.</p>

<p>Dead silence had fallen, silence that Ba&rsquo;alzamon let
deepen before he spoke. &ldquo;There is now one who walks the world, one
who was and will be, but is not yet, the Dragon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A startled murmur ran through his listeners.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Dragon Reborn! We are to kill him, Great Lord?&rdquo;
That from the Shienaran, hand grasping eagerly at his side where
his sword would hang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Ba&rsquo;alzamon said simply. &ldquo;And perhaps not.
Perhaps he can be turned to my use. Sooner or later it will be so,
in this Age or another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man who called himself Bors blinked. <em>In this
Age or another? I thought the Day of Return was near. What matter
to me what happens in another Age if I grow old and die waiting in
this one?</em> But Ba&rsquo;alzamon was speaking again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Already a bend is forming in the Pattern, one of
many points where he who will become the Dragon may be turned to my
service. Must be turned! Better that he serve me alive than dead,
but alive or dead, serve me he must and will! These three you must
know, for each is a thread in the pattern I mean to weave, and it
will be up to you to see that they are placed as I command. Study
them well, that you will know them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly all sound was gone. The man who called
himself Bors shifted uneasily, and saw others doing the same. All
but the Illianer woman, he realized. With her hands spread over
her bosom as if to hide the rounded flesh she exposed, eyes wide,
half frightened and half ecstatic, she was nodding eagerly as
though to someone face-to-face with her. Sometimes she appeared to
give a reply, but the man who called himself Bors heard not a word.
Suddenly she arched backwards, trembling and rising on her toes. He
could not see why she did not fall, unless something unseen held
her. Then, just as abruptly, she settled back to her feet and
nodded again, bowing, shivering. Even as she straightened, one of
the women wearing a Great Serpent ring gave a start and began
nodding.</p>

<p><em>So each of us hears his own instructions, and
none hears another&rsquo;s</em>. The man who called himself Bors muttered
in frustration. If he knew what even one other was commanded, he
might be able to use the knowledge to advantage, but this way&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Impatiently he waited for his turn, forgetting himself enough to
stand straight.</p>

<p>One by one the gathering received their orders, each
walled in silence yet still giving tantalizing clues, if only he
could read them. The man of the Atha&rsquo;an Miere, the Sea Folk,
stiffening with reluctance as he nodded. The Shienaran, his stance
bespeaking confusion even while he acquiesced. The second woman of
Tar Valon giving a start, as of shock, and the gray-swathed figure
whose sex he could not determine shaking its head before falling to
its knees and nodding vigorously. Some underwent the same
convulsion as the Illianer woman, as if pain itself lifted them to
toe tips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man who called himself Bors jerked as a red mask
filled his eyes. He could still see the room, still see the
floating shape of Ba&rsquo;alzamon and the three figures before him, but
at the same time all he could see was the red-masked face. Dizzy,
he felt as if his skull were splitting open and his eyes were being
pushed out of his head. For a moment he thought he could see flames
through the eyeholes of the mask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you faithful&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Bors?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hint of mocking in the name sent a chill down his
backbone. &ldquo;I am faithful, Great Lord. I cannot hide from you.&rdquo;
<em>I am faithful! I swear it!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you cannot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The certainty in Ba&rsquo;alzamon&rsquo;s voice dried his mouth,
but he forced himself to speak. &ldquo;Command me, Great Lord, and I
obey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Firstly, you are to return to Tarabon and continue
your <em>good</em> works. In fact, I command you to redouble your
efforts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stared at Ba&rsquo;alzamon in puzzlement, but then fires
flared again behind the mask, and he took the excuse of a bow to
pull his eyes away. &ldquo;As you command, Great Lord, so shall it
be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Secondly, you will watch for the three young men,
and have your followers watch. Be warned; they are dangerous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man who called himself Bors glanced at the
figures floating in front of Ba&rsquo;alzamon. <em>How can I do that? I
can see them, but I can&rsquo;t see anything except</em> his
<em>face</em>. His head felt about to burst. Sweat slicked his
hands under his thin gloves, and his shirt clung to his back.
&ldquo;Dangerous, Great Lord? Farmboys? Is one of them the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A sword is dangerous to the man at the point, but
not to the man at the hilt. Unless the man holding the sword is a
fool, or careless, or unskilled, in which case it is twice as
dangerous to him as to anyone else. It is enough that I have told
you to know them. It is enough that you obey me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you command, Great Lord, so shall it be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thirdly, regarding those who have landed at Toman
Head, and the Domani. Of this you will speak to no one. When you
return to Tarabon&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man who called himself Bors realized as he
listened that his mouth was sagging open. The instructions made no
sense. <em>If I knew what some of the others were told, perhaps I
could piece it together</em>.</p>

<p>Abruptly he felt his head grasped as though by a
giant hand crushing his temples, felt himself being lifted, and the
world blew apart in a thousand starbursts, each flash of light
becoming an image that fled across his mind or spun and dwindled
into the distance before he could more than barely grasp it. An
impossible sky of striated clouds, red and yellow and black, racing
as if driven by the mightiest wind the world had ever seen. A woman&mdash;a girl?&mdash;dressed in white receded into blackness and
vanished as soon as she appeared. A raven stared him in the eye,
knowing him, and was gone. An armored man in a brutal helm, shaped
and painted and gilded like some monstrous, poisonous insect,
raised a sword and plunged to one side, beyond his view. A horn,
curled and golden, came hurtling out of the far distance. One
piercing note it sounded as it flashed toward him, tugging his
soul. At the last instant it flashed into a blinding, golden ring
of light that passed through him, chilling him beyond death. A wolf
leaped from the shadows of lost sight and ripped out his throat. He
could not scream. The torrent went on, drowning him, burying him.
He could barely remember who he was, or what he was. The skies
rained fire, and the moon and stars fell; rivers ran in blood, and
the dead walked; the earth split open and fountained molten rock&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The man who called himself Bors found himself half
crouching in the chamber with the others, most watching him, all
silent. Wherever he looked, up or down or in any direction, the
masked face of Ba&rsquo;alzamon overwhelmed his eyes. The images that had
flooded into his mind were fading; he was sure many were already
gone from memory. Hesitantly, he straightened, Ba&rsquo;alzamon always
before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great Lord, what&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some commands are too important to be known even by
he who carries them out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man who called himself Bors bent almost double in
his bow. &ldquo;As you command, Great Lord,&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely, &ldquo;so
shall it be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he straightened, he was alone in silence once
more. Another, the Taren High Lord, nodded and bowed to someone
none else saw. The man who called himself Bors put an unsteady hand
to his brow, trying to hold on to something of what had burst
through his mind, though he was not completely certain he wanted to
remember. The last remnant flickered out, and suddenly he was
wondering what it was that he was trying to recall. <em>I know
there was something, but what? There</em> was <em>something! Wasn&rsquo;t
there?</em> He rubbed his hands together, grimacing at the feel of
sweat under his gloves, and turned his attention to the three
figures hanging suspended before Ba&rsquo;alzamon&rsquo;s floating form.</p>

<p>The muscular, curly-haired youth; the farmer with the
sword; and the lad with the look of mischief on his face. Already,
in his mind, the man who called himself Bors had named them the
Blacksmith, the Swordsman, and the Trickster. <em>What is their
place in the puzzle?</em> They must be important, or Ba&rsquo;alzamon
would not have made them the center of this gathering. But from his
orders alone they could all die at any time, and he had to think
that some of the others, at least, had orders as deadly for the
three. <em>How important are they?</em> Blue eyes could mean the
nobility of Andor&mdash;unlikely in those clothes&mdash;and there were
Borderlanders with light eyes, as well as some Tareni, not to
mention a few from Ghealdan, and, of course&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;No, no help
there. But <em>yellow</em> eyes? <em>Who</em> are <em>they?
What</em> are <em>they?</em></p>

<p>He started at a touch on his arm, and looked around
to find one of the white-clad servants, a young man, standing by
his side. The others were back, too, more than before, one for each
of the masked. He blinked. Ba&rsquo;alzamon was gone. The Myrddraal was
gone, too, and only rough stone was where the door it had used had
been. The three figures still hung there, though. He felt as if
they were staring at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it please you, my Lord Bors, I will show you to
your room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Avoiding those dead eyes, he glanced once more at the
three figures, then followed. Uneasily he wondered how the youth
had known what name to use. It was not until the strange carved
doors closed behind him and they had walked a dozen paces that he
realized he was alone in the corridor with the servant. His brows
drew down suspiciously behind his mask, but before he could open
his mouth, the servant spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The others are also being shown to their rooms, my
Lord. If you please, my Lord? Time is short, and our Master is
impatient.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man who called himself Bors ground his teeth,
both at the lack of information and at the implication of sameness
between himself and the servant, but he followed in silence. Only a
fool ranted at a servant, and worse, remembering the fellow&rsquo;s eyes,
he was not sure it would do any good. <em>And how did he know what
I was going to ask?</em> The servant smiled.</p>

<p>The man who called himself Bors did not feel at all
comfortable until he was back in the room where he had waited on
first arriving, and then not much. Even finding the seals on his
saddlebags untouched was small comfort.</p>

<p>The servant stood in the hallway, not entering. &ldquo;You
may change to your own garments if you wish, my Lord. None will see
you depart here, nor arrive at your destination, but it may be best
to arrive already properly clothed. Someone will come soon to show
you the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Untouched by any visible hand, the door swung
shut.</p>

<p>The man who called himself Bors shivered in spite of
himself. Hastily he undid the seals and buckles of his saddlebags
and pulled out his usual cloak. In the back of his mind a small
voice wondered if the promised power, even the immortality, was
worth another meeting like this, but he laughed it down
immediately. <em>For that much power, I would praise the Great Lord
of the Dark under the Dome of Truth</em>. Remembering the commands
given him by Ba&rsquo;alzamon, he fingered the golden, flaring sun worked
on the breast of the white cloak, and the red shepherd&rsquo;s crook
behind the sun, symbol of his office in the world of men, and he
almost laughed. There was work, great work, to be done in Tarabon,
and on Almoth Plain.</p>
