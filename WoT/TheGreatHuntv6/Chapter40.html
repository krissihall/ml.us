<h4><em>Damane</em></h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">E</span>gwene
dismounted as the Waygate opened, and when
Liandrin motioned them through, she led the shaggy mare carefully
out. Even so, she and Bela both stumbled in brush flattened by the
opening Waygate as they suddenly seemed to be moving even more
slowly. A screen of dense shrubs had surrounded and hidden the
Waygate. There were only a few trees close by, and a morning breeze
ruffled foliage with a little more color than the leaves had had in
Tar Valon.</p>

<p>Watching her friends emerge after her, she had been
standing there a good minute before she became aware that others
were already there, just out of sight on the other side of the
gates. When she did notice them she stared uncertainly; they were
as odd a group as she had ever seen, and she had heard too many
rumors of the war on Toman Head.</p>

<p>Armored men, at least fifty of them, with overlapping
steel plates down their chests and dull black helmets shaped like
insects&rsquo; heads, sat their saddles or stood beside their horses,
staring at her and the emerging women, staring at the Waygate,
muttering among themselves. The only bareheaded man among them, a
tall, dark-faced, hook-nosed fellow standing with a
gilded-and-painted helmet on his hip, looked astonished at what he
was seeing. There were women with the soldiers, too. Two wore
plain, dark gray dresses and wide silver collars, and stood staring
intently at those coming out of the Waygate, each with another
woman close behind her as if ready to speak into her ear. Two other
women, standing a little apart, wore wide, divided skirts that came
well short of their ankles, and panels embroidered with forked
lightning bolts on their bosoms and skirts. Oddest of all was the
last woman, reclining on a palanquin borne by eight muscular,
bare-chested men in baggy black trousers. The sides of her scalp
were shaved so that only a wide crest of black hair remained to
fall down her back. A long, cream-colored robe worked in flowers
and birds on blue ovals was carefully arranged to show her skirts
of pleated white, and her fingernails were a good inch long, the
first two on each hand lacquered blue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Liandrin Sedai,&rdquo; Egwene asked uneasily, &ldquo;do you know
who these people are?&rdquo; Her friends fingered their reins as if
wondering whether to mount and run, but Liandrin replaced the <em>
Avendesora</em> leaf and stepped forward confidently as the Waygate
began to close.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The High Lady Suroth?&rdquo; Liandrin said, making it
halfway between a question and statement.</p>

<p>The women on the palanquin nodded fractionally. &ldquo;You
are Liandrin.&rdquo; Her speech was slurred, and it took Egwene a moment
to understand. &ldquo;Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Suroth added with a twist to her lips,
and a murmur rose among the soldiers. &ldquo;We must be done here
quickly, Liandrin. There are patrols, and it would not do to be
found. You would enjoy the attentions of the Seekers for Truth no
more than I. I mean to be back in Falme before Turak knows I am
gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; Nynaeve demanded. &ldquo;What
is she talking about, Liandrin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Liandrin laid a hand on Nynaeve&rsquo;s shoulder and one on
Egwene&rsquo;s. &ldquo;These are the two of whom you were told. And there is
another.&rdquo; She nodded toward Elayne. &ldquo;She is the Daughter-Heir of
Andor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two women with the lightning on their dresses
were approaching the party in front of the Waygate&mdash;they
carried coils of some silvery metal in their hands, Egwene noticed&mdash;and the bareheaded soldier came with them. He did not put a
hand near the sword hilt sticking up above his shoulder, and he
wore a casual smile, but Egwene still watched him narrowly.
Liandrin gave no sign of agitation; otherwise Egwene would have
jumped onto Bela right then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Liandrin Sedai,&rdquo; she said urgently, &ldquo;who are these
people? Are they here to help Rand and the others, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hook-nosed man suddenly seized Min and Elayne by
the scruffs of their necks, and in the next instant everything
seemed to happen at once. The man yelled a curse, and a woman
screamed, or perhaps more than one woman; Egwene could not be sure.
Abruptly the breeze was a gale that whipped away Liandrin&rsquo;s angry
shout in clouds of dirt and leaves and made the trees bend and
groan. Horses reared and whinnied shrilly. And one of the women
reached out and fastened something around Egwene&rsquo;s neck.</p>

<p>Cloak flapping like a sail, Egwene braced against the
wind and tugged at what felt like a collar of smooth metal. It
would not budge; under her frantic fingers, it felt all of one
piece, though she knew it had to have some kind of clasp. The
silvery coils the woman had carried now trailed over Egwene&rsquo;s
shoulder, their other end joining a bright bracelet on the woman&rsquo;s
left wrist. Balling her fist tightly, Egwene hit the woman as hard
as she could, right in her eye&mdash;and staggered and fell to her
knees herself, head ringing. It felt as if a large man had struck
her in the face.</p>

<p>When she could see straight once more, the wind had
died. A number of horses wandered loose, Bela and Elayne&rsquo;s mare
among them, and some of the soldiers were cursing and picking
themselves up off the ground. Liandrin was calmly brushing dust and
leaves from her dress. Min knelt, supporting herself with her
hands, groggily trying to rise further. The hook-nosed man stood
over her, his hand dripping blood. Min&rsquo;s knife lay just out of her
reach, the blade stained red along one side. Nynaeve and Elayne
were nowhere to be seen, and Nynaeve&rsquo;s mare was gone, too. So were
some of the soldiers, and one of the pairs of women. The other two
were still there, and Egwene could see now that they were linked by
a silver cord just like the one that still joined her to the woman
standing over her.</p>

<p>That woman was rubbing her cheek as she squatted
beside Egwene; there was a bruise already coming up around her left
eye. With long, dark hair and big brown eyes, she was pretty, and
perhaps as much as ten years older than Nynaeve. &ldquo;Your first
lesson,&rdquo; she said emphatically. There was no animosity in her
voice, but what almost sounded like friendliness. &ldquo;I will not
punish you further this time, since I should have been on guard
with a newly caught <em>damane</em>. Know this. You are a <em>
damane</em>, a Leashed One, and I am a <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>, a Holder
of the Leash. When <em>damane</em> and <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> are joined,
whatever hurt the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> feels, the <em>damane</em> feels
twice over. Even to death. So you must remember that you may never
strike at a <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> in any way, and you must protect your
<em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> even more than yourself. I am Renna. How are you
called?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;what you said,&rdquo; Egwene muttered. She
pulled at the collar again; it gave no more than before. She
thought of knocking the woman down and trying to pry the bracelet
from her wrist, but rejected it. Even if the soldiers did not try
to stop her&mdash;and so far they seemed to be ignoring her and
Renna altogether&mdash;she had the sinking feeling the woman was
telling the truth. Touching her left eye brought a wince; it did
not feel puffy, so perhaps she was not actually growing a bruise to
match Renna&rsquo;s, but it still hurt. Her left eye, and Renna&rsquo;s left
eye. She raised her voice. &ldquo;Liandrin Sedai? Why are you letting
them do this?&rdquo; Liandrin dusted her hands together, never looking in
her direction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very first thing you must learn,&rdquo; Renna said,
&ldquo;is to do exactly as you are told, and without delay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene gasped. Suddenly her skin burned and prickled
as if she had rolled in stinging nettles, from the soles of her
feet to her scalp. She tossed her head as the burning sensation
increased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>,&rdquo; Renna went on in that almost
friendly tone, &ldquo;do not believe <em>damane</em> should be allowed
names, or at least only names they are given. But I am the one who
took you, so I will be in charge of your training, and I will allow
you to keep your own name. If you do not displease me too far. I am
mildly upset with you now. Do you really wish to keep on until I am
angry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quivering, Egwene gritted her teeth. Her nails dug
into her palms with the effort of not scratching wildly. <em>Idiot!
It&rsquo;s only your name</em>. &ldquo;Egwene,&rdquo; she managed to get out. &ldquo;I am
Egwene al&rsquo;Vere.&rdquo; Instantly the burning itch was gone. She let out a
long, unsteady breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egwene,&rdquo; Renna said. &ldquo;That is a good name.&rdquo; And to
Egwene&rsquo;s horror, Renna patted her on the head as she would a
dog.</p>

<p>That, she realized, was what she had detected in the
woman&rsquo;s voice&mdash;a certain good will for a dog in training, not
quite the friendliness one might have toward another human
being.</p>

<p>Renna chuckled. &ldquo;Now you are even angrier. If you
intend to strike at me again, remember to make it a small blow, for
you will feel it twice as hard as I. Do not attempt to channel;
that you will never do without my express command.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene&rsquo;s eye throbbed. She pushed herself to her feet
and tried to ignore Renna, as much as it was possible to ignore
someone who held a leash fastened to a collar around your neck. Her
cheeks burned when the other woman chuckled again. She wanted to go
to Min, but the amount of leash Renna had let out would not reach
that far. She called softly, &ldquo;Min, are you all right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sitting slowly back on her heels, Min nodded, then
put a hand to her head as if she wished she had not moved it.</p>

<p>Jagged lightning crackled across the clear sky, then
struck among the trees some distance off. Egwene jumped, and
suddenly smiled. Nynaeve was still free, and Elayne. If anyone
could free her and Min, Nynaeve could. Her smile faded into a glare
for Liandrin. For whatever the reason the Aes Sedai had betrayed
them, there would be a reckoning. <em>Someday. Somehow</em>. The
glare did no good; Liandrin did not look away from the
palanquin.</p>

<p>The bare-chested men knelt, lowering the palanquin to
the ground, and Suroth stepped down, carefully arranging her robe,
then picked her way to Liandrin on soft-slippered feet. The two
women were much of a size. Brown eyes stared levelly into
black.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were to bring me two,&rdquo; Suroth said. &ldquo;Instead, I
have only one, while two run loose, one of them more powerful by
far than I had been led to believe. She will attract every patrol
of ours within two leagues.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I brought you three,&rdquo; Liandrin said calmly. &ldquo;If you
cannot manage to hold them, perhaps our master should find another
among you to serve him. You take fright at trifles. If patrols
come, kill them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lightning flashed again in the near distance, and
moments later something roared like thunder not far from where it
struck; a cloud of dust rose into the air. Neither Liandrin nor
Suroth took any notice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could still return to Falme with two new <em>
damane</em>,&rdquo; Suroth said. &ldquo;It grieves me to allow an&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Aes
Sedai&rdquo;&mdash;she twisted the words like a curse&mdash;&ldquo;to walk
free.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Liandrin&rsquo;s face did not change, but Egwene saw a
nimbus abruptly glow around her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beware, High Lady,&rdquo; Renna called. &ldquo;She stands
ready!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a stir among the soldiers, a reaching for
swords and lances, but Suroth only steepled her hands, smiling at
Liandrin over her long nails. &ldquo;You will make no move against me,
Liandrin. Our master would disapprove, as I am surely needed here
more than you, and you fear him more than you fear being made <em>
damane</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Liandrin smiled, though white spots marked her cheeks
with anger. &ldquo;And you, Suroth, fear him more than you fear me
burning you to a cinder where you stand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so. We both fear him. Yet even our master&rsquo;s
needs will change with time. All <em>marath&rsquo;damane</em> will be
leashed eventually. Perhaps I will be the one who places the collar
around your lovely throat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you say, Suroth. Our master&rsquo;s needs will change.
I will remind you of it on the day when you kneel to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A tall leatherleaf perhaps a mile away suddenly
became a roaring torch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This grows tiresome,&rdquo; Suroth said. &ldquo;Elbar, recall
them.&rdquo; The hooknosed man produced a horn no bigger than his fist;
it made a hoarse, piercing cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must find the woman Nynaeve,&rdquo; Liandrin said
sharply. &ldquo;Elayne is of no importance, but both the woman and this
girl here must be taken with you on your ships when you sail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know very well what has been commanded, <em>
marath&rsquo;damane</em>, though I would give much to know why.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;However much you were told, child,&rdquo; Liandrin
sneered, &ldquo;that is how much you are allowed to know. Remember that
you serve and obey. These two must be removed to the other side of
the Aryth Ocean and kept there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suroth sniffed. &ldquo;I will not remain here to find this
Nynaeve. My usefulness to our master will be at an end if Turak
hands me over to the Seekers for Truth.&rdquo; Liandrin opened her mouth
angrily, but Suroth refused to allow her a word. &ldquo;The woman will
not remain free for long. Neither of them will. When we sail again,
we will take with us every woman on this miserable spit of land who
can channel even slightly, leashed and collared. If you wish to
remain and search for her, do so. Patrols will be here soon,
thinking to engage the rabble that still hides in the countryside.
Some patrols take <em>damane</em> with them, and they will not care
what master you serve. Should you survive the encounter, the leash
and collar will teach you a new life, and I do not believe our
master will trouble to deliver one foolish enough to let herself be
taken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If either is allowed to remain here,&rdquo; Liandrin said
tightly, &ldquo;our master will trouble himself with you, Suroth. Take
them both, or pay the price.&rdquo; She strode to the Waygate, clutching
the reins of her mare. Soon it was closing behind her.</p>

<p>The soldiers who had gone after Nynaeve and Elayne
came galloping back with the two women linked by leash, collar, and
bracelet, the <em>damane</em> and the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> riding side
by side. Three men led horses with bodies across the saddles.
Egwene felt a surge of hope when she realized the bodies all wore
armor. They had not caught Nynaeve or Elayne, either one.</p>

<p>Min started to rise to her feet, but the hook-nosed
man planted a boot between her shoulder blades and drove her to the
ground. Gasping for breath, she twitched there weakly. &ldquo;I beg
permission to speak, High Lady,&rdquo; he said. Suroth made a small
motion with her hand, and he went on. &ldquo;This peasant cut me, High
Lady. If the High Lady has no use for her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; Suroth motioned
slightly again, already turning away, and he reached over his
shoulder for the hilt of his sword.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Egwene shouted. She heard Renna curse softly,
and suddenly the burning itch covered her skin again, worse than
before, but she did not stop. &ldquo;Please! High Lady, please! She is my
friend!&rdquo; Pain such as she had never known wracked her through the
burning. Every muscle knotted and cramped; she pitched on her face
in the dirt, mewling, but she could still see Elbar&rsquo;s heavy, curved
blade come free of its sheath, see him raise it with both hands.
&ldquo;Please! Oh, Min!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly, the pain was gone as if it had never been;
only the memory remained. Suroth&rsquo;s blue velvet slippers,
dirt-stained now, appeared in front of her face, but it was at
Elbar that she stared. He stood there with his sword over his head
and all his weight on the foot on Min&rsquo;s back&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and he did not
move.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This peasant is your friend?&rdquo; Suroth said.</p>

<p>Egwene started to rise, but at a surprised arching of
Suroth&rsquo;s eyebrow, she remained lying where she was and only raised
her head. She had to save Min. <em>If it means groveling</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She parted her lips and hoped her gritted teeth would pass for a
smile. &ldquo;Yes, High Lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if I spare her, if I allow her to visit you
occasionally, you will work hard and learn as you are taught?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will, High Lady.&rdquo; She would have promised much
more to keep that sword from splitting Min&rsquo;s skull. <em>I&rsquo;ll even
keep it</em>, she thought sourly, <em>as long as I have
to</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put the girl on her horse, Elbar,&rdquo; Suroth said. &ldquo;Tie
her on, if she cannot sit her saddle. If this <em>damane</em>
proves a disappointment, perhaps then I will let you have the head
of the girl.&rdquo; She was already moving toward her palanquin.</p>

<p>Renna pulled Egwene roughly to her feet and pushed
her toward Bela, but Egwene had eyes only for Min. Elbar was no
gentler with Min than Renna with her, but she thought Min was all
right. At least Min shrugged off Elbar&rsquo;s attempt to tie her across
her saddle and climbed onto her gelding with only a little
help.</p>

<p>The odd party started off, westward, with Suroth
leading and Elbar slightly to the rear of her palanquin, but close
enough to heed any summons immediately. Renna and Egwene rode at
the back with Min, and the other <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> and <em>
damane</em>, behind the soldiers. The woman who had apparently
meant to collar Nynaeve fondled the coiled silver leash she still
carried and looked angry. Sparse forest covered the rolling land,
and the smoke of the burning leatherleaf was soon only a smudge in
the sky behind them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were honored,&rdquo; Renna said after a time, &ldquo;having
the High Lady speak to you. Another time, I would let you wear a
ribbon to mark the honor. But since you brought her attention on
yourself&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene cried out as a switch seemed to lash across
her back, then another across her leg, her arm. From every
direction they seemed to come; she knew there was nothing to block,
but she could not help throwing her arms about as if to stop the
blows. She bit her lip to stifle her moans, but tears still rolled
down her cheeks. Bela whinnied and danced, but Renna&rsquo;s grip on the
silver leash kept her from carrying Egwene away. None of the
soldiers even looked back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing to her?&rdquo; Min shouted. &ldquo;Egwene?
Stop it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You live on sufferance&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Min, is it?&rdquo; Renna said
mildly. &ldquo;Let this be a lesson for you as well. So long as you try
to interfere, it will not stop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min raised a fist, then let it fall. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t
interfere. Only, please, stop it. Egwene, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The unseen blows went on for a few moments more, as
if to show Min her intervention had done nothing, then ceased, but
Egwene could not stop shuddering. The pain did not go away this
time. She pushed back the sleeve of her dress, thinking to see
weals; her skin was unmarked, but the feel of them was still there.
She swallowed. &ldquo;It was not your fault, Min.&rdquo; Bela tossed her head,
eyes rolling, and Egwene patted the mare&rsquo;s shaggy neck. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t
yours, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was your fault, Egwene,&rdquo; Renna said. She sounded
so patient, dealing so kindly with someone who was too dense to see
the right, that Egwene wanted to scream. &ldquo;When a <em>damane</em> is
punished, it is always her fault, even if she does not know why. A
<em>damane</em> must anticipate what her <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> wants.
But this time, you do know why. <em>Damane</em> are like furniture,
or tools, always there ready to be used, but never pushing
themselves forward for attention. Especially not for the attention
of one of the Blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene bit her lip until she tasted blood. <em>This
is a nightmare. It can&rsquo;t be real. Why did Liandrin do this? Why it
this happening?</em> &ldquo;May&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;may I ask a question?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of me, you may.&rdquo; Renna smiled. &ldquo;Many <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em> will wear your bracelet over the years&mdash;there
are always many more <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> than <em>damane</em>&mdash;and some would have your hide in strips if you took your eyes off
the floor or opened your mouth without permission, but I see no
reason not to let you speak, so long as you are careful in what you
say.&rdquo; One of the other <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> snorted loudly; she was
linked to a pretty, dark-haired woman in her middle years who kept
her eyes on her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Liandrin&rdquo;&mdash;Egwene would not give her the
honorific, not ever again&mdash;&ldquo;and the High Lady spoke of a
master they both serve.&rdquo; The thought came into her head of a man
with almost healed burns marring his face, and eyes and mouth that
sometimes turned to fire, but even if he was only a figure in her
dreams that seemed too horrible to contemplate. &ldquo;Who is he? What
does he want with me and&mdash;and Min?&rdquo; She knew it was silly to
avoid naming Nynaeve&mdash;she did not think any of these people
would forget her just because her name was not mentioned,
especially the blue-eyed <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> stroking her empty leash&mdash;but it was the only way she could think of fighting back at
the moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The affairs of the Blood,&rdquo; Renna said, &ldquo;are not for
me to take notice of, and certainly not for you. The High Lady will
tell me what she wishes me to know, and I will tell you what I wish
you to know. Anything else that you hear or see must be to you as
if it never was said, as if it never happened. This way lies
safety, most especially for a <em>damane</em>. <em>Damane</em> are
too valuable to be killed out of hand, but you might find yourself
not only soundly punished, but absent a tongue to speak or hands to
write. <em>Damane</em> can do what they must without these
things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene shivered, though the air was not very cold.
Pulling her cloak up onto her shoulders, her hand brushed the
leash, and she jerked at it fitfully. &ldquo;This is a horrible thing.
How can you do this to anyone? What diseased mind ever thought of
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The blue-eyed <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> with the empty leash
growled, &ldquo;This one could do without her tongue already, Renna.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Renna only smiled patiently. &ldquo;How is it horrible?
Could we allow anyone to run loose who can do what a <em>
damane</em> can? Sometimes men are born who would be <em>
marath&rsquo;damane</em> if they were women&mdash;it is so here also, I
have heard&mdash;and they must be killed, of course, but the women
do not go mad. Better for them to become <em>damane</em> than make
trouble contending for power. As for the mind that first thought of
the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>, it was the mind of a woman who called herself
Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene knew incredulity must be painting her face,
because Renna laughed openly. &ldquo;When Luthair Paendrag Mondwin, son
of the Hawkwing, first faced the Armies of the Night, he found many
among them who called themselves Aes Sedai. They contended for
power among themselves and used the One Power on the field of
battle. One such, a woman named Deain, who thought she could do
better serving the Emperor&mdash;he was not Emperor then, of
course&mdash;since he had no Aes Sedai in his armies, came to him
with a device she had made, the first <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>, fastened to the neck
of one of her sisters. Though that woman did not want to serve
Luthair, the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> required her to serve. Deain made more
<em>a&rsquo;dam</em>, the first <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> were found, and women
captured who called themselves Aes Sedai discovered that they were
in fact only <em>marath&rsquo;damane</em>, Those Who Must Be Leashed. It
is said that when she herself was leashed, Deain&rsquo;s screams
shook the Towers of Midnight, but of course she, too, was a <em>
marath&rsquo;damane</em>, and <em>marath&rsquo;damane</em> cannot be allowed to
run free. Perhaps you will be one of those who has the ability to
make <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>. If so, you will be pampered, you may rest
assured.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene looked yearningly at the countryside through
which they rode. The land was beginning to rise in low hills, and
the thin forest had dwindled to scattered thickets, but she was
sure she could lose herself in them. &ldquo;Am I supposed to look forward
to being pampered like a pet dog?&rdquo; she said bitterly. &ldquo;A lifetime
of being chained to men and women who think I am some kind of
animal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not men.&rdquo; Renna chuckled. &ldquo;All <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> are
women. If a man put on this bracelet, most of the time it would be
no different than if it were hanging on a peg on the wall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And sometimes,&rdquo; the blue-eyed <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> put
in harshly, &ldquo;you and he would both die screaming.&rdquo; The woman had
sharp features and a tight, thin-lipped mouth, and Egwene realized
that anger was apparently her permanent expression. &ldquo;From time to
time the Empress plays with lords by linking them to a <em>damane</em>. It makes the lords sweat and entertains the Court of
the Nine Moons. The lord never knows until it is done whether he
will live or die, and neither does the <em>damane</em>.&rdquo; Her laugh
was vicious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only the Empress can afford to waste <em>damane</em>
in such a way, Alwhin,&rdquo; Renna snapped, &ldquo;and I do not mean to train
this <em>damane</em> only to have her thrown away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not seen any training at all so far, Renna.
Only a great deal of chatter, as if you and this <em>damane</em>
were girlhood friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is time to see what she can do,&rdquo; Renna
said, studying Egwene. &ldquo;Do you have enough control yet to channel
at that distance?&rdquo; She pointed to a tall oak standing alone on a
hilltop.</p>

<p>Egwene frowned at the tree, perhaps half a mile from
the line followed by the soldiers and Suroth&rsquo;s palanquin. She had
never tried anything much beyond arm&rsquo;s reach, but she thought it
might be possible. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try,&rdquo; Renna told her. &ldquo;Feel the tree. Feel the sap
in the tree. I want you to make it all not only hot, but so hot
that every drop of sap in every branch flashes to steam in an
instant. Do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene was shocked to discover an urge to do as Renna
commanded. She had not channeled, or even touched <em>saidar</em>,
in two days; the desire to fill herself with the One Power made her
shiver. &ldquo;I&rdquo;&mdash;in half a heartbeat she discarded &ldquo;will not&rdquo;;
the weals that were not there still burned too sharply for her to
be quite that foolish&mdash;&ldquo;cannot,&rdquo; she finished instead. &ldquo;It is
too far, and I&rsquo;ve never done anything like that before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> laughed raucously, and
Alwhin said, &ldquo;She never even tried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Renna shook her head almost sadly. &ldquo;When one has been
a <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> long enough,&rdquo; she told Egwene, &ldquo;one learns to
tell many things about <em>damane</em> even without the bracelet,
but with the bracelet one can always tell whether a <em>damane</em>
has tried to channel. You must never lie to me, or to any <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em>, not even by a hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly the invisible switches were back, striking
at her everywhere. Yelling, she tried to hit Renna, but the <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em> casually knocked her fist away, and Egwene felt as if
Renna had hit her arm with a stick. She dug her heels into Bela&rsquo;s
flanks, but the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>&rsquo;s grip on the leash nearly pulled
her out of her saddle. Frantically she reached for <em>saidar</em>,
meaning to hurt Renna enough to make her stop, just the kind of
hurt she herself had been given. The <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> shook her
head wryly; Egwene howled as her own skin was suddenly scalded. Not
until she fled from <em>saidar</em> completely did the burn begin
to fade, and the unseen blows never ceased or slowed. She tried to
shout that she would try, if only Renna would stop, but all she
could manage was to scream and writhe.</p>

<p>Dimly, she was aware of Min shouting angrily and
trying to ride to her side, of Alwhin tearing Min&rsquo;s reins from her
hands, of another <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> speaking sharply to her <em>
damane</em>, who looked at Min. And then Min was yelling, too, arms
flapping as if trying to ward off blows or beat away stinging
insects. In her own pain, Min&rsquo;s seemed distant.</p>

<p>Their cries together were enough to make some of the
soldiers twist in their saddles. After one look, they laughed and
turned back. How <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> dealt with <em>damane</em> was no
affair of theirs.</p>

<p>To Egwene it seemed to go on forever, but at last
there was an end. She lay sprawled weakly across the cantle of her
saddle, cheeks wet with tears, sobbing into Bela&rsquo;s mane. The mare
whickered uneasily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is good that you have spirit,&rdquo; Renna said calmly.
&ldquo;The best <em>damane</em> are those who have spirit to be shaped
and molded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene squeezed her eyes shut. She wished she could
close her ears, too, to shut out Renna&rsquo;s voice. <em>I have to get
away. I have to, but how? Nynaeve, help me. Light, somebody help
me</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will be one of the best,&rdquo; Renna said in tones of
satisfaction. Her hand stroked Egwene&rsquo;s hair, a mistress soothing
her dog.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Nynaeve leaned out of her saddle to peer around the
screen of prickly leafed shrubs. Scattered trees met her eyes, some
with leaves turning color. The expanses of grass and brush between
seemed empty. Nothing moved that she could see except the thinning
column of smoke, wavering in a breeze, from the leatherleaf.</p>

<p>That had been her work, the leatherleaf, and once the
lightning called from a clear sky, and a few other things she had
not thought to try until those two women tried them on her. She
thought they must work together in some way, though she could not
understand their relation to each other, apparently leashed as they
were. One wore a collar, but the other was chained as surely as
she. What Nynaeve was sure of was that one or both were Aes Sedai.
She had never had a clear enough sight of them to see the glow of
channeling, but it had to be.</p>

<p><em>I&rsquo;ll certainly take pleasure in telling Sheriam
about them</em>, she thought dryly. <em>Aes Sedai don&rsquo;t use the
Power as a weapon, do they?</em></p>

<p>She certainly had. She had at least knocked the two
women down with that lightning strike, and she had seen one of the
soldiers, or his body rather, burn from the ball of fire she made
and hurled at them. But she had not seen any of the strangers at
all in some time now.</p>

<p>Sweat beaded on her forehead, and it was not all from
exertion. Her contact with <em>saidar</em> was gone, and she could
not bring it back. In that first fury of knowing that Liandrin had
betrayed them, <em>saidar</em> had been there almost before she
knew it, the One Power flooding her. It had seemed she could do
anything. And as long as they had chased her, rage at being hunted
like an animal had fueled her. Now the chase had vanished. The
longer she had gone without seeing an enemy at whom she could
strike, the more she had begun to worry that they might be sneaking
up on her somehow, and the more she had had time to worry about
what was happening to Egwene, and Elayne, and Min. Now she was
forced to admit that what she felt most was fear. Fear for them,
fear for herself. It was anger she needed.</p>

<p>Something stirred behind a tree.</p>

<p>Her breath caught, and she fumbled for <em>
saidar</em>, but all the exercises Sheriam and the others had
taught her, all the blossoms unfolding in her mind, all the
imagined streams that she held like riverbanks, did no good. She
could feel it, sense the Source, but she could not touch it.</p>

<p>Elayne stepped from behind the tree in a wary crouch,
and Nynaeve sagged with relief. The Daughter-Heir&rsquo;s dress was dirty
and torn, her golden hair was a tangle of snarls and leaves, and
her searching eyes were as wide as those of a frightened fawn, but
she held her short-bladed dagger in a steady hand. Nynaeve picked
up her reins and rode into the open.</p>

<p>Elayne gave a convulsive jump, then her hand went to
her throat and she drew a deep breath. Nynaeve dismounted, and the
two women hugged, taking comfort in having found each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For a moment,&rdquo; Elayne said as they finally stepped
apart, &ldquo;I thought you were&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Do you know where they are? There
were two men following me. Another few minutes and they would have
caught me, but a horn sounded and they turned their horses and
galloped off. They could see me, Nynaeve, and they just left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard it, too, and I haven&rsquo;t seen any of them
since. Have you seen Egwene, or Min?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne shook her head, slumping to sit on the ground.
&ldquo;Not since&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;That man hit Min, knocked her down. And one of
those women was trying to put something around Egwene&rsquo;s neck. I saw
that much before I ran. I don&rsquo;t think they got away, Nynaeve. I
should have done something. Min cut the hand that was holding me,
and Egwene&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I just ran, Nynaeve. I realized I was free, and I
ran. Mother had better marry Gareth Bryne and have another daughter
as soon as she can. I am not fit to take the throne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a goose,&rdquo; Nynaeve said sharply. &ldquo;Remember,
I have a packet of sheepstongue root among my herbs.&rdquo; Elayne had
her head in her hands; the gibe did not even produce a murmur.
&ldquo;Listen to me, girl. Did you see me stay to fight twenty or thirty
armed men, not to mention the Aes Sedai? If you had waited, the
most likely thing by far is that you would be a prisoner, too. If
they didn&rsquo;t just kill you. They seemed to be interested in Egwene
and me for some reason. They might not have cared whether you
remained alive or not.&rdquo; <em>Why</em> are <em>they interested in
Egwene and me? Why us in particular? Why did Liandrin do this?
Why?</em> She had no more answers now than she had had the first
time she asked herself these questions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I had died trying to help them&mdash;&rdquo; Elayne
began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;you&rsquo;d be dead. And little good you&rsquo;d be then,
to yourself or them. Now get on your feet and brush off your
dress.&rdquo; Nynaeve rummaged in her saddlebags for a hairbrush. &ldquo;And
fix your hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne got up slowly, and took the brush with a small
laugh. &ldquo;You sound like Lini, my old nurse.&rdquo; She began to run the
brush through her hair, wincing as tangles pulled. &ldquo;But how are we
going to help them, Nynaeve? You may be as strong as a full sister
when you are angry, but they have women who can channel, too. I
cannot think they&rsquo;re Aes Sedai, but they might as well be. We do
not even know in which direction they took them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;West,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. &ldquo;That creature Suroth mentioned
Falme, and that&rsquo;s as far west on Toman Head as you can go. We will
go to Falme. I hope Liandrin is there. I will make her curse the
day her mother laid eyes on her father. But first I think we had
better find some clothes of the country. I&rsquo;ve seen Taraboner and
Domani women in the Tower, and what they wear is nothing like what
we have on. We would stand out in Falme as strangers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not mind a Domani dress&mdash;though Mother
would surely have a fit if she ever found out I&rsquo;d worn one, and
Lini would never let me hear the end of it&mdash;but even if we
find a village, can we afford new dresses? I have no idea how much
money you have, but I have only ten gold marks and perhaps twice
that in silver. That will keep us two or three weeks, but I don&rsquo;t
know what we will do after that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A few months as a novice in Tar Valon,&rdquo; Nynaeve
said, laughing, &ldquo;has not stopped you thinking like the heir to a
throne. I don&rsquo;t have a tenth what you do, but altogether it will
keep us two or three months, in comfort. Longer, if we are careful.
I have no intention of buying us dresses, and they won&rsquo;t be new in
any case. My gray silk dress will do us some good, with all those
pearls and that gold thread. If I can&rsquo;t find a woman who will trade
us each two or three sturdy changes for that, I will give you this
ring, and I will be the novice.&rdquo; She swung up into her saddle and
reached a hand down to pull Elayne up behind her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are we going to do when we reach Falme?&rdquo; Elayne
asked as she settled on the mare&rsquo;s rump.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t know that until we are there.&rdquo; Nynaeve
paused, letting the horse stand. &ldquo;Are you sure you want to do this?
It will be dangerous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More dangerous than it is for Egwene and Min? They
would come after us if our circumstances were reversed; I know they
would. Are we going to stay here all day?&rdquo; Elayne dug her heels in,
and the mare started off.</p>

<p>Nynaeve turned the horse until the sun, still short
of its noonday crest, shone at their backs. &ldquo;We are going to have
to be cautious. The Aes Sedai we know can recognize a woman who can
channel just by being within arm&rsquo;s length of her. These Aes Sedai
may be able to pick us out of a crowd if they are looking for us,
and we had better assume they are.&rdquo; <em>They were certainly looking
for Egwene and me. But why?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, cautious. You were right before, too. We will
not do them any good letting ourselves be caught as well.&rdquo; Elayne
was silent for a moment. &ldquo;Do you think it was all lies, Nynaeve?
What Liandrin told us about Rand being in danger? And the others?
Aes Sedai do not lie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Nynaeve&rsquo;s turn to be silent, remembering
Sheriam telling her of the oaths a woman took on being raised to
full sisterhood, oaths spoken inside a <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> that
bound her to keep them. <em>To speak no word that is not true</em>.
That was one, but everyone knew that the truth an Aes Sedai said
might not be the truth you thought you heard. &ldquo;I expect Rand is
warming his feet in front of Lord Agelmar&rsquo;s fire in Fal Dara this
minute,&rdquo; she said. <em>I can&rsquo;t worry about him, now. I have to think
about Egwene and Min</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose he is,&rdquo; Elayne said with a sigh. She
shifted behind the saddle. &ldquo;If it is very far to Falme, Nynaeve, I
expect to ride in the saddle half the time. This is not a very
comfortable seat. We will never reach Falme at all if you let this
horse set her own pace the whole way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve booted the mare to a quick trot, and Elayne
yelped and caught at her cloak. Nynaeve told herself that she would
take a turn riding behind and not complain if Elayne put the horse
to a gallop, but for the most part she ignored the gasps of the
woman bouncing behind her. She was too busy hoping that by the time
they reached Falme, she could stop being afraid and start being
angry.</p>

<p>The breeze freshened, cool and brisk with a hint of
cold yet to come.</p>
