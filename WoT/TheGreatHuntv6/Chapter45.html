<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
rising sun pushed its crimson edge above the
horizon and sent long shadows down the cobblestone streets of Falme
toward the harbor. A sea breeze bent the smoke of breakfast cook
fires inland from the chimneys. Only the early risers were already
out of doors, their breath making steam in the morning cold.
Compared to the crowds that would fill the streets in another hour,
the town seemed nearly empty.</p>

<p>Sitting on an upended barrel in front of a
still-closed ironmonger&rsquo;s shop, Nynaeve warmed her hands under her
arms and surveyed her army. Min sat on a doorstep across the way,
swathed in her Seanchan cloak and eating a wrinkled plum, and
Elayne in her fleece coat huddled at the edge of an alley just down
the street from her. A large sack, pilfered from the docks, lay
neatly folded beside Min. <em>My army</em>, Nynaeve thought grimly.
<em>But there isn&rsquo;t anybody else</em>.</p>

<p>She caught sight of a <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> and a <em>
damane</em> climbing the street, a yellow-haired woman wearing the
bracelet and a dark woman the collar, both yawning sleepily. The
few Falmen sharing the street with them averted their eyes and gave
them a wide berth. As far as she could see down toward the harbor,
there was not another Seanchan. She did not turn her head the other
way. Instead, she stretched and shrugged as if working cold
shoulders before settling back as she had been.</p>

<p>Min tossed her half-eaten plum aside, glanced
casually up the street, and leaned back on the doorpost. The way
was clear there, too, or she would have put her hands on her knees.
Min had started rubbing her hands nervously, and Nynaeve realized
that Elayne was now bouncing eagerly on her toes.</p>

<p><em>If they give us away, I&rsquo;ll thump both their
heads</em>. But she knew if they were discovered, it would be the
Seanchan who would say what happened to all three of them. She was
all too aware that she had no real notion of whether what she
planned would work or not. It could easily be her own failure that
would give them away. Once again she resolved that if anything went
wrong, she would somehow pull attention to herself while Min and
Elayne escaped. She had told them to run if anything went wrong,
and let them think she would run, too. What she would do then, she
did not know. <em>Except I won&rsquo;t let them take me alive. Please,
Light, not that</em>.</p>

<p><em>Sul&rsquo;dam</em> and <em>damane</em> came up the
street until they were bracketed by the three waiting women. A
dozen Falmen walked wide of the linked pair.</p>

<p>Nynaeve gathered all of her anger. Leashed Ones and
Leash Holders. They had put their filthy collar on Egwene&rsquo;s neck,
and they would put it on hers, and Elayne&rsquo;s, if they could. She had
made Min tell her how <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> enforced their will. She was
sure Min had kept some back, the worst, but what she told was
enough to heat Nynaeve to white-hot fury. In an instant a white
blossom on a black, thorny branch had opened to light, to <em>
saidar</em>, and the One Power filled her. She knew there was a
glow around her, for those who could see it. The pale-skinned <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em> gave a start, and the dark <em>damane</em>&rsquo;s mouth
fell open, but Nynaeve gave them no chance. It was only a trickle
of the Power that she channeled, but she cracked it, a whip
snapping a dust mote out of the air.</p>

<p>The silver collar sprang open and clattered to the
cobblestones. Nynaeve heaved a sigh of relief even as she leaped to
her feet.</p>

<p>The <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> stared at the fallen collar as
if at a poisonous snake. The <em>damane</em> put a shaking hand to
her throat, but before the woman in the lightning-marked dress had
time to move, the <em>damane</em> turned and punched her in the
face; the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>&rsquo;s knees buckled, and she almost
fell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good for you!&rdquo; Elayne shouted. She was already
running forward, too, and so was Min.</p>

<p>Before any of them reached the two women, the <em>
damane</em> took one startled look around, then ran as hard as she
could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t hurt you!&rdquo; Elayne called after her. &ldquo;We are
friends!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet!&rdquo; Nynaeve hissed. She produced a handful of
rags from her pocket and ruthlessly stuffed them into the gaping
mouth of the still staggering <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>. Min hastily shook
out the sack in a cloud of dust and plunged it over the <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em>&rsquo;s head, shrouding the woman to the waist. &ldquo;We are
already attracting too much attention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was true, and yet not entirely true. The four of
them stood in a rapidly emptying street, but the people who had
decided to be elsewhere were avoiding looking at them. Nynaeve had
been counting on that&mdash;people doing their best to ignore
anything that had to do with Seanchan&mdash;to gain them a few moments.
They would talk eventually, but in whispers; it might take hours
for the Seanchan to learn anything had happened.</p>

<p>The hooded woman began to struggle, making
rag-muffled shouts from the sack, but Nynaeve and Min threw their
arms around her and wrestled her toward a nearby alley. The leash
and collar trailed across the cobblestones behind them,
clinking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pick it up,&rdquo; Nynaeve snapped at Elayne. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t
bite you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne took a deep breath, then gathered the silver
metal gingerly, as if she feared it very well might. Nynaeve felt
some sympathy, but not much; everything rested on each of them
doing as they had planned.</p>

<p>The <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> kicked and tried to throw
herself free, but between them, Nynaeve and Min forced her along,
down the alley into another, slightly wider passage behind houses,
to yet another alley and at last into a rough wooden shed that had
apparently once housed two horses, by the stalls. Few could afford
to keep horses since the Seanchan came, and in a day of Nynaeve&rsquo;s
watching, no one had gone near it. The interior had a musty
dustiness that spoke of abandonment. As soon as they were inside,
Elayne dropped the silver leash and wiped her hands on some
straw.</p>

<p>Nynaeve channeled another trickle, and the bracelet
fell to the dirt floor. The <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> squalled and hurled
herself about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked. The other two nodded, and
they yanked the sacking off their prisoner.</p>

<p>The <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> wheezed, blue eyes teary from
dust, but her red face was red as much from anger as from the sack.
She darted for the door, but they caught her in the first step. She
was not weak, yet they were three, and when they were done the <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em> was stripped to her shift and lying in one of the
stalls, bound hand and foot with stout cord, with another piece of
cord to keep her from forcing the gag out.</p>

<p>Soothing a puffy lip, Min eyed the lightning-paneled
dress and soft boots they had laid out. &ldquo;It might fit you, Nynaeve.
It won&rsquo;t fit Elayne or me.&rdquo; Elayne was picking straw out of her
hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can see that. You were never a choice anyway, not
really. They know you too well.&rdquo; Nynaeve hurriedly removed her own
clothes. She tossed them aside and donned the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>&rsquo;s
dress. Min helped with the buttons.</p>

<p>Nynaeve wiggled her toes in the boots; they were a
little tight. The dress was tight, too, across the bosom, and loose
elsewhere. The hem hung almost to the ground, lower than <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em> wore them, but the fit would have been even worse on
any of the others. Snatching up the bracelet, she took a deep
breath and closed it around her left wrist. The ends merged, and it
seemed solid. It did not feel like anything except a bracelet. She
had been afraid that it would.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get the dress, Elayne.&rdquo; They had dyed a pair of
dresses&mdash;one of hers and one of Elayne&rsquo;s&mdash;to the gray
<em>damane</em> wore, or as close as they could manage, and hidden
them here. Elayne did not move except to stare at the open collar
and lick her lips. &ldquo;Elayne, you have to wear it. Too many of them
have seen Min for her to do it. I would have worn it, if this dress
had fit you instead.&rdquo; She thought she would have gone mad if she
had had to wear the collar; that was why she could not make her
voice sharp with Elayne now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Elayne sighed. &ldquo;I just wish I knew more of
what it does to you.&rdquo; She drew her red-gold hair out of the way.
&ldquo;Min, help me, please.&rdquo; Min began undoing the buttons down the back
of her dress.</p>

<p>Nynaeve managed to pick up the silver collar without
flinching. &ldquo;There is one way to find out.&rdquo; With only a moment of
hesitation, she bent and snapped it around the neck of the <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em>. <em>She deserves it if anyone does</em>, she told
herself firmly. &ldquo;She might be able to tell us something useful,
anyway.&rdquo; The blue-eyed woman glanced at the leash trailing from her
neck to Nynaeve&rsquo;s wrist, then glared up at her contemptuously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t work that way,&rdquo; Min said, but Nynaeve
barely heard.</p>

<p>She was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;aware&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;of the other woman, aware
of what she was feeling, cord digging into her ankles and into her
wrists behind her back, the rank fish taste of the rags in her
mouth, straw pricking her through the thin cloth of her shift. It
was not as if she, Nynaeve, felt these things, but in her head was
a lump of sensations that she knew belonged to the <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em>.</p>

<p>She swallowed, trying to ignore them&mdash;they
would not go away&mdash;and addressed the bound woman. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t
hurt you if you answer my questions truthfully. We aren&rsquo;t Seanchan.
But if you lie to me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She lifted the leash threateningly.</p>

<p>The woman&rsquo;s shoulders shook, and her mouth curled
around the gag in a sneer. It took Nynaeve a moment to realize the
<em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> was laughing.</p>

<p>Her mouth tightened, but then a thought came to her.
That bundle of sensation inside her head seemed to be everything
physical that the other woman felt. Experimentally, she tried
adding to it.</p>

<p>Eyes suddenly bulging out of her head, the <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em> gave a cry that the gag only partially stopped.
Fanning her hands behind her as if trying to ward off something,
she humped through the straw in a vain effort to escape.</p>

<p>Nynaeve gaped, and hastily rid herself of the extra
feelings she had added. The <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> sagged, weeping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;What did you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;do to her?&rdquo; Elayne
asked faintly. Min only stared, her mouth hanging open.</p>

<p>Nynaeve answered gruffly. &ldquo;The same thing Sheriam did
to you when you threw a cup at Marith.&rdquo; <em>Light, but this is a
filthy thing</em>.</p>

<p>Elayne gulped loudly. &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But an <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> isn&rsquo;t supposed to work that
way,&rdquo; Min said. &ldquo;They always claimed it won&rsquo;t work on any woman who
cannot channel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not care how it is supposed to work, so long as
it does.&rdquo; Nynaeve seized the silver metal leash right where it
joined the collar, and pulled the woman up enough to look her in
the eyes. Frightened eyes, she saw. &ldquo;You listen to me, and listen
well. I want answers, and if I don&rsquo;t get them, I&rsquo;ll make you think
I have had the hide off you.&rdquo; Stark terror rolled across the
woman&rsquo;s face, and Nynaeve&rsquo;s stomach heaved as she suddenly realized
the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> had taken her literally. <em>If she thinks I
can, it&rsquo;s because she knows. That is what these leashes are
for</em>. She took firm hold of herself to stop from clawing the
bracelet off her wrist. Instead, she hardened her face. &ldquo;Are you
ready to answer me? Or do you need more convincing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The frantic head-shaking was answer enough. When
Nynaeve removed the gag, the woman only paused to swallow once
before babbling, &ldquo;I will not report you. I swear it. Only take this
from my neck. I have gold. Take it. I swear, I will never tell
anyone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet,&rdquo; Nynaeve snapped, and the woman shut her
mouth immediately. &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seta. Please. I will answer you, but please take&mdash;it&mdash;off! If anyone sees it on me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Seta&rsquo;s eyes
rolled down to stare at the leash, then squeezed shut. &ldquo;Please?&rdquo;
she whispered.</p>

<p>Nynaeve realized something. She could never make
Elayne wear that collar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Best we get on with it,&rdquo; Elayne said firmly. She was
down to her shift, too, now. &ldquo;Give me a moment to put this other
dress on, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put your own clothes back on,&rdquo; Nynaeve said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Someone has to pretend to be a <em>damane</em>,&rdquo;
Elayne said, &ldquo;or we will never reach Egwene. That dress fits you,
and it cannot be Min. That leaves me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said put your clothes on. We have somebody to be
our Leashed One.&rdquo; Nynaeve tugged at the leash that held Seta, and
the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! No, please! If anyone sees me&mdash;&rdquo; She cut
off at Nynaeve&rsquo;s cold stare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As far as I am concerned, you are worse than a
murderer, worse than a Darkfriend. I can&rsquo;t think of anything worse
than you. The fact that I have to wear this thing on my wrist, to
be the same as you for even an hour, sickens me. So if you think
there is anything I&rsquo;ll balk at doing to you, think again. You don&rsquo;t
want to be seen? Good. Neither do we. No one really looks at a <em>
damane</em>, though. As long as you keep your head down the way a
Leashed One is supposed to, no one will even notice you. But you
had better do the best you can to make sure the rest of us aren&rsquo;t
noticed, either. If we are, you surely will be seen, and if that is
not enough to hold you, I promise you I&rsquo;ll make you curse the first
kiss your mother ever gave your father. Do we understand each
other?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Seta said faintly. &ldquo;I swear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve had to remove the bracelet in order for them
to slide Elayne&rsquo;s gray-dyed dress down the leash and over Seta&rsquo;s
head. It did not fit the woman well, being loose at the bosom and
tight across the hips, but Nynaeve&rsquo;s would have been as bad, and
too short besides. Nynaeve hoped people really did not look at <em>
damane</em>. She put the bracelet back on reluctantly.</p>

<p>Elayne gathered up Nynaeve&rsquo;s clothes, wrapped the
other dyed dress around them, and made a bundle, a bundle for a
woman in farm clothes to be carrying as she followed a <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em> and a <em>damane</em>. &ldquo;Gawyn will eat his heart out
when he hears about this,&rdquo; she said, and laughed. It sounded
forced.</p>

<p>Nynaeve looked at her closely, then at Min. It was
time for the dangerous part. &ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s smile faded. &ldquo;I am ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ready,&rdquo; Min said curtly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;we&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;going?&rdquo; Seta said,
quickly adding, &ldquo;If I may ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Into the lions&rsquo; den,&rdquo; Elayne told her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To dance with the Dark One,&rdquo; Min said.</p>

<p>Nynaeve sighed and shook her head. &ldquo;What they are
trying to say is, we are going where all the <em>damane</em> are
kept, and we intend to free one of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seta was still gaping in astonishment when they
hustled her out of the shed.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Bayle Domon watched the rising sun from the deck of
his ship. The docks were already beginning to bustle, though the
streets leading up from the harbor stood largely empty. A gull
perched on a piling stared at him; gulls had pitiless eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure about this, Captain?&rdquo; Yarin asked. &ldquo;If
the Seanchan wonder what we&rsquo;re all doing aboard&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You just make certain there do be an axe near every
mooring line,&rdquo; Domon said curtly. &ldquo;And, Yarin? Do any man try to
cut a line before those women are aboard, I will split his
skull.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What if they don&rsquo;t come, Captain? What if it&rsquo;s
Seanchan soldiers instead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Settle your bowels, man! If soldiers come, I will
make a run for the harbor mouth, and the Light have mercy on us
all. But until soldiers do come, I mean to wait for those women.
Now go look as if you are no doing anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Domon turned back to peering up into the town, toward
where the <em>damane</em> were held. His fingers drummed a nervous
tattoo on the railing.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The breeze from the sea brought the smell of
breakfast cook fires to Rand&rsquo;s nose, and tried to flap at his
moth-eaten cloak, but he held it closed with one hand as Red neared
the town. There had not been a coat to fit him in the clothes they
had found, and he thought it best to keep the fine silver
embroidery on his sleeves and the herons on his collar hidden. The
Seanchan attitude toward conquered people carrying weapons might
not extend to those with heron-mark swords, either.</p>

<p>The first shadows of morning stretched out ahead of
him. He could just see Hurin riding in among the wagon yards and
horse lots. Only one or two men moved among the lines of merchant
wagons, and they wore the long aprons of wheelwrights or
blacksmiths. Ingtar, the first in, was already out of sight. Perrin
and Mat followed behind Rand at spaced intervals. He did not look
back to check on them. There was not supposed to be anything to
connect them; five men coming into Falme at an early hour, but not
together.</p>

<p>The horse lots surrounded him, horses already
crowding the fences, waiting to be fed. Hurin put his head out from
between two stables, their doors still closed and barred, saw Rand
and motioned to him before ducking back. Rand turned the bay
stallion that way.</p>

<p>Hurin stood holding his horse by the reins. He had on
one of the long vests instead of his coat, and despite the heavy
cloak that hid his short sword and sword-breaker, he shivered with
the cold. &ldquo;Lord Ingtar&rsquo;s back there,&rdquo; he said, nodding down the
narrow passage. &ldquo;He says we&rsquo;ll leave the horses here and go the
rest of the way on foot.&rdquo; As Rand dismounted, the sniffer added,
&ldquo;Fain went right down that street, Lord Rand. I can almost smell it
from here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand led Red down the way to where Ingtar had already
tied his own behind the stable. The Shienaran did not look very
much like a lord in a dirty fleece coat with holes worn through the
leather in several places, and his sword looked odd belted over it.
His eyes had a feverish intensity.</p>

<p>Tying Red alongside Ingtar&rsquo;s stallion, Rand hesitated
over his saddlebags. He had not wanted to leave the banner behind.
He did not think any of the soldiers would have gone into the bags,
but he could not say the same for Verin, nor predict what she would
do if she found the banner. Still, it made him uneasy to have it
with him. He decided to leave the saddlebags tied behind his
saddle.</p>

<p>Mat joined them, and a few moments later Hurin came
with Perrin. Mat wore baggy trousers stuffed into the tops of his
boots, and Perrin his too-short cloak. Rand thought they all looked
like villainous beggars, but they had all passed largely unnoticed
in the villages.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Ingtar said, &ldquo;Let us see what we see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They strolled out to the dirt street as if they had
no particular destination in mind, talking among themselves, and
ambled past the wagon yards onto sloping cobblestone streets. Rand
was not sure what he himself said, much less anyone else. Ingtar&rsquo;s
plan had been for them to look like any other group of men walking
together, but there were all too few people out-of-doors. Five men
made a crowd in those cold morning streets.</p>

<p>They walked in a bunch, but it was Hurin who led
them, sniffing the air and turning up this street and down that.
The rest turned when he did, as if that was what they had intended
all along. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s crisscrossed this town,&rdquo; Hurin muttered,
grimacing. &ldquo;His smell is everywhere, and it stinks so, it&rsquo;s hard to
tell old from new. At least I know he&rsquo;s still here. Some of it
cannot be older than a day or two, I&rsquo;m sure. I am sure,&rdquo; he added
less doubtfully.</p>

<p>A few more people began to appear, here a fruit
peddler setting his wares on tables, there a fellow hurrying along
with a big roll of parchments under his arm and a sketch-board
slung across his back, a knife-sharpener oiling the shaft of his
grinding wheel on its barrow. Two women walked by, headed the other
way, one with downcast eyes and a silver collar around her neck,
the other, in a dress worked with lightning bolts, holding a coiled
silver leash.</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s breath caught; it was an effort not to look
back at them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; Mat&rsquo;s eyes were open wide, staring
out of the hollows of his eye sockets. &ldquo;Was that a <em>
damane</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the way they were described,&rdquo; Ingtar said
curtly. &ldquo;Hurin, are we going to walk every street in this
Shadowcursed town?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been everywhere, Lord Ingtar,&rdquo; Hurin said. &ldquo;His
stench is everywhere.&rdquo; They had come into an area where the stone
houses were three and four stories high, as big as inns.</p>

<p>They rounded a corner, and Rand was taken aback by
the sight of a score of Seanchan soldiers standing guard in front
of a big house on one side of the street&mdash;and by the sight of
two women in lightning-marked dresses talking on the doorsteps of
another across from it. A banner flapped in the wind over the house
the soldiers protected; a golden hawk clutching lightning bolts.
Nothing marked out the house where the women talked except
themselves. The officer&rsquo;s armor was resplendent in red and black
and gold, his helmet gilded and painted to look like a spider&rsquo;s
head. Then Rand saw the two big, leathery-skinned shapes crouched
among the soldiers and missed a step.</p>

<p><em>Grolm</em>. There was no mistaking those
wedge-shaped heads with their three eyes. <em>They can&rsquo;t be</em>.
Perhaps he was really asleep, and this was all a nightmare. <em>
Maybe we haven&rsquo;t even left for Falme yet</em>.</p>

<p>The others stared at the beasts as they walked past
the guarded house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What in the name of the Light are they?&rdquo; Mat
asked.</p>

<p>Hurin&rsquo;s eyes seemed as big as his face. &ldquo;Lord Rand,
they&rsquo;re&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Those are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; Rand said. After a moment, Hurin
nodded.</p>

<p>We are here for the Horn,&rdquo; Ingtar said, &ldquo;not to
stare at Seanchan monsters. Concentrate on finding Fain,
Hurin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The soldiers barely glanced at them. The street ran
straight down to the round harbor. Rand could see ships anchored
down there; tall, square-looking ships with high masts, small in
that distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been here a lot.&rdquo; Hurin scrubbed at his nose
with the back of his hand. &ldquo;The street stinks of layer on layer of
him. I think he might have been here as late as yesterday, Lord
Ingtar. Maybe last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat suddenly clutched his coat with both hands. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
in there,&rdquo; he whispered. He turned arond and walked backwards,
peering at the tall house with the banner. &ldquo;The dagger is in there.
I didn&rsquo;t even notice it before, because of those&mdash;those things,
but I can feel it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin poked a finger in his ribs. &ldquo;Well stop that
before they start wondering why you&rsquo;re goggling at them like a
fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand glanced over his shoulder. The officer was
looking after them.</p>

<p>Mat turned around sullenly. &ldquo;Are we just going to
keep on walking? It&rsquo;s in there, I tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Horn is what we are after,&rdquo; Ingtar growled. &ldquo;I
mean to find Fain and make him tell me where it is.&rdquo; He did not
slow down.</p>

<p>Mat said nothing, but his entire face was a plea.</p>

<p><em>I have to find Fain, too</em>, Rand thought. <em>
I have to</em>. But when he looked at Mat&rsquo;s face, he said, &ldquo;Ingtar,
if the dagger is in that house, Fain likely is too. I can&rsquo;t see him
letting the dagger or the Horn, either one, far out of his
sight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ingtar stopped. After a moment, he said, &ldquo;It could
be, but we will never know from out here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We could watch for him to come out,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;If
he comes out at this time of the morning, then he spent the night
there. And I&rsquo;ll wager where he sleeps is where the Horn is. If he
does come out, we can be back to Verin by midday and have a plan
made before nightfall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not mean to wait for Verin,&rdquo; Ingtar said, &ldquo;and
neither will I wait for night. I&rsquo;ve waited too long already. I mean
to have the Horn in my hands before the sun sets again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t know, Ingtar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know the dagger is in there,&rdquo; Mat said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Hurin says Fain was here last night.&rdquo; Ingtar
overrode Hurin&rsquo;s attempts to qualify that. &ldquo;It is the first time
you have been willing to say anything closer than a day or two. We
are going to take back the Horn now. Now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; Rand said. The officer was no longer watching
them, but there were still at least twenty soldiers in front of the
building. And a pair of <em>grolm</em>. <em>This is madness. There
can&rsquo;t be</em> grolm <em>here</em>. Thinking it did not make the
beasts disappear, though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There seem to be gardens behind all these houses,&rdquo;
Ingtar said, looking around thoughtfully. &ldquo;If one of those alleys
runs by a garden wall&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Sometimes men are so busy guarding
their front, they neglect their back. Come.&rdquo; He headed straight for
the nearest narrow passage between two of the tall houses. Hurin
and Mat trotted right after him.</p>

<p>Rand exchanged looks with Perrin&mdash;his
curly-haired friend gave a resigned shrug&mdash;and they followed,
too.</p>

<p>The alley was barely wider than their shoulders, but
it ran between high garden walls until it crossed another alley big
enough for a push-barrow or small cart. That was cobblestoned, too,
but only the backs of buildings looked down on it, shuttered
windows and expanses of stone, and the high back walls of gardens
overtopped by nearly leafless branches.</p>

<p>Ingtar led them along that alley until they were
opposite the waving banner. Taking his steel-backed gauntlets from
under his coat, he put them on and leaped up to catch the top of
the wall, then pulled himself up enough to peek over. He reported
in a low monotone. &ldquo;Trees. Flower beds. Walks. There isn&rsquo;t a soul
to be&mdash;Wait! A guard. One man. He isn&rsquo;t even wearing his
helmet. Count to fifty, then follow me.&rdquo; He swung a boot to the top
of the wall and rolled over inside, disappearing before Rand could
say a word.</p>

<p>Mat began to count slowly. Rand held his breath.
Perrin fingered his axe, and Hurin gripped the hilts of his
weapons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;fifty.&rdquo; Hurin scrambled up and over the wall
before the word was well out of Mat&rsquo;s mouth. Perrin went right
beside him.</p>

<p>Rand thought Mat might need some help&mdash;he looked so
pale and drawn&mdash;but he gave no sign of it as he scrambled up. The
stone wall provided plenty of handholds, and moments later Rand was
crouched on the inside with Mat and Perrin and Hurin.</p>

<p>The garden was in the grip of deep autumn, flower
beds empty except for a few evergreen shrubs, tree branches nearly
bare. The wind that rippled the banner stirred dust across the
flagstone walks. For a moment Rand could not find Ingtar. Then he
saw the Shienaran, flat against the back wall of the house,
motioning them on with sword in hand.</p>

<p>Rand ran in a crouch, more conscious of the windows
blankly peering down from the house than of his friends running
beside him. It was a relief to press himself against the house
beside Ingtar.</p>

<p>Mat kept muttering to himself, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in there. I can
feel it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is the guard?&rdquo; Rand whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dead,&rdquo; Ingtar said. &ldquo;The man was overconfident. He
never even tried to raise a cry. I hid his body under one of those
bushes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stared at him. <em>The</em> Seanchan <em>was
overconfident</em>? The only thing that kept him from going back
right then was Mat&rsquo;s anguished murmurs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are almost there.&rdquo; Ingtar sounded as if he were
speaking to himself, too. &ldquo;Almost there. Come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand drew his sword as they started up the back
steps. He was aware of Hurin unlimbering his short-bladed sword and
notched sword-breaker, and Perrin reluctantly drawing his axe from
the loop on his belt.</p>

<p>The hallway inside was narrow. A half-open door to
their right smelled like a kitchen. Several people were moving
about in that room; there was an indistinguishable sound of voices,
and occasionally the soft clatter of a pot lid.</p>

<p>Ingtar motioned Mat to lead, and they crept by the
door. Rand watched the narrowing opening until they were around the
next corner.</p>

<p>A slender young woman with dark hair came out of a
door ahead of them, carrying a tray with one cup. They all froze.
She turned the other way without looking in their direction. Rand&rsquo;s
eyes widened. Her long white robe was all but transparent. She
vanished around another corner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see that?&rdquo; Mat said hoarsely. &ldquo;You could see
right through&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ingtar clapped a hand over Mat&rsquo;s mouth and whispered,
&ldquo;Keep your mind on why we are here. Now find it. Find the Horn for
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat pointed to a narrow set of winding stairs. They
climbed a flight, and he led them toward the front of the house.
The furnishings in the hallways were sparse, and seemed all curves.
Here and there a tapestry hung on a wall, or a folding screen stood
against it, each painted with a few birds on branches, or a flower
or two. A river flowed across one screen, but aside from rippling
water and narrow strips of riverbank, the rest of it was blank.</p>

<p>All around them Rand could hear the sounds of people
stirring, slippers scuffing on the floor, soft murmurs of speech.
He did not see anyone, but he could imagine it all too well,
someone stepping into the hall to see five slinking men with
weapons in their hands, shouting an alarm&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In there,&rdquo; Mat whispered, pointing to a big pair of
sliding doors ahead, carved handholds their only ornamentation. &ldquo;At
least, the dagger is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ingtar looked at Hurin; the sniffer slid the doors
open, and Ingtar leaped through with his sword ready. There was no
one there. Rand and the others hurried inside, and Hurin quickly
closed the doors behind them.</p>

<p>Painted screens hid all the walls and any other
doors, and veiled the light coming through windows that had to
overlook the street. At one end of the big room stood a tall,
circular cabinet. At the other was a small table, the lone chair on
the carpet turned to face it. Rand heard Ingtar gasp, but he only
felt like heaving a sigh of relief. The curling golden Horn of
Valere sat on a stand on the table. Below it, the ruby in the hilt
of the ornate dagger caught the light.</p>

<p>Mat darted to the table, snatching Horn and dagger.
&ldquo;We have it,&rdquo; he crowed, shaking the dagger in his fist. &ldquo;We have
both of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so loud,&rdquo; Perrin said with a wince. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
have them out of here, yet.&rdquo; His hands were busy on the haft of his
axe; they seemed to want to be holding something else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Horn of Valere.&rdquo; There was sheer awe in Ingtar&rsquo;s
voice. He touched the Horn hesitantly, tracing a finger along the
silver script inlaid around the bell and mouthing the translation,
then pulled his hand back with a shiver of excitement. &ldquo;It is. By
the Light, it is! I am saved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hurin was moving the screens that hid the windows. He
shoved the last out of his way and peered into the street below.
&ldquo;Those soldiers are all still there, looking like they&rsquo;ve took
root.&rdquo; He shuddered. &ldquo;Those&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;things, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand went to join him. The two beasts were <em>
grolm</em>; there was no denying it. &ldquo;How did they&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; As he
lifted his eyes from the street, words died. He was looking over a
wall into the garden of the big house across the street. He could
see where further walls had been torn down, joining other gardens
to it. Women sat on benches there, or strolled along the walks,
always in pairs. Women linked, neck to wrist, by silver leashes.
One of the women with a collar around her neck looked up. He was
too far to make out her face clearly, but for an instant it seemed
that their eyes met, and he knew. The blood drained from his face.
&ldquo;Egwene,&rdquo; he breathed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; Mat said. &ldquo;Egwene is
safe in Tar Valon. I wish I were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; Rand said. The two women were turning,
walking toward one of the buildings on the far side of the joined
gardens. &ldquo;She is there, right across the street. Oh, Light, she&rsquo;s
wearing one of those collars!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; Perrin said. He came to peer from the
window. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see her, Rand. And&mdash;and I could recognize
her if I did, even at this distance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; Rand said. The two women disappeared
into one of the houses that faced the next street over. His stomach
was twisted into a knot. <em>She is supposed to be safe. She&rsquo;s
supposed to be in the White Tower</em>. &ldquo;I have to get her out. The
rest of you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; The slurring voice was as soft as the sound of
the doors sliding in their tracks. &ldquo;You are not who I
expected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a brief moment, Rand stared. The tall man with
the shaven head who had stepped into the room wore a long, trailing
blue robe, and his fingernails were so long that Rand wondered if
he could handle anything. The two men standing obsequiously behind
him had only half their dark hair shaved, the rest hanging in a
dark braid down each man&rsquo;s right cheek. One of them cradled a
sheathed sword in his arms.</p>

<p>It was only a moment he had for staring, then screens
toppled to reveal, at either end of the room, a doorway crowded
with four or five Seanchan soldiers, bareheaded but armored, and
swords in hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are in the presence of the High Lord Turak,&rdquo; the
man who carried the sword began, staring at Rand and the others
angrily, but a brief motion of a finger with a blue-lacquered nail
cut him short. The other servant stepped forward with a bow and
began undoing Turak&rsquo;s robe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When one of my guards was found dead,&rdquo; the
shaven-headed man said calmly, &ldquo;I suspected the man who calls
himself Fain. I have been suspicious of him since Huon died so
mysteriously, and he has always wanted that dagger.&rdquo; He held out
his arms for the servant to remove his robe. Despite his soft,
almost-singing voice, hard muscles roped his arms and smooth chest,
which was bare to a blue sash holding wide, white trousers that
seemed made of hundreds of pleats. He sounded uninterested, and
indifferent to the blades in their hands. &ldquo;And now to find
strangers with not only the dagger, but the Horn. It will please me
to kill one or two of you for disturbing my morning. Those who
survive will tell me of who you are and why you came.&rdquo; He stretched
out a hand without looking&mdash;the man with the scabbarded sword
laid the hilt in the hand&mdash;and drew the heavy, curved blade.
&ldquo;I would not have the Horn damaged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turak gave no other signal, but one of the soldiers
stalked into the room and reached for the Horn. Rand did not know
whether he should laugh, or not. The man wore armor, but his
arrogant face seemed as oblivious to their weapons as Turak
was.</p>

<p>Mat put an end to it. As the Seanchan reached out his
hand, Mat slashed it with the ruby-hilted dagger. With a curse, the
soldier leaped back, looking surprised. And then he screamed. It
chilled the room, held everyone where they stood in astonishment.
The trembling hand he held up in front of his face was turning
black, darkness creeping outwards from the bleeding gash that
crossed his palm. He opened his mouth wide and howled, clawing at
his arm, then his shoulder. Kicking, jerking, he toppled to the
floor, thrashing on the silken carpet, shrieking as his face grew
black and his dark eyes bulged like overripe plums, until a dark,
swollen tongue gagged him. He twitched, choking raggedly, heels
drumming, and did not move again. Every bit of his exposed flesh
was black as putrid pitch and looked ready to burst at a touch.</p>

<p>Mat licked his lips and swallowed; his grip shifted
uneasily on the dagger. Even Turak stared, openmouthed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Ingtar said softly, &ldquo;we are no easy meat.&rdquo;
Suddenly he leaped over the corpse, toward the soldiers still
goggling at what was left of the man who had stood at their
shoulders only moments before. &ldquo;Shinowa!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Follow me!&rdquo;
Hurin leaped after him, and the soldiers fell back before them, the
sounds of steel on steel rising.</p>

<p>The Seanchan at the other end of the room started
forward as Ingtar moved, but then they were falling back, too,
before Mat&rsquo;s thrusting dagger even more than from the axe Perrin
swung with wordless snarls.</p>

<p>In the space of heartbeats, Rand stood alone, facing
Turak, who held his blade upright before him. His moment of shock
was gone. His eyes were sharp on Rand&rsquo;s face; the black and swollen
body of one of his soldiers might as well not have existed. It did
not seem to exist for the two servants, either, any more than Rand
and his sword existed, or the sounds of fighting, fading now from
the rooms to either side out into the house. The servants had begun
calmly folding Turak&rsquo;s robe as soon as the High Lord took his
sword, and had not looked up even for the dead soldier&rsquo;s shrieks;
now they knelt beside the door and watched with impassive eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suspected it might come to you and me.&rdquo; Turak spun
his blade easily, a full circle one way, then the other, his
long-nailed fingers moving delicately on the hilt. His fingernails
did not seem to hamper him at all. &ldquo;You are young. Let us see what
is required to earn the heron on this side of the ocean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly Rand saw. Standing tall on Turak&rsquo;s blade was
a heron. With the little training he had, he was face-to-face with
a real blademaster. Hastily he tossed the fleece-lined cloak aside,
ridding himself of weight and encumbrance. Turak waited.</p>

<p>Rand desperately wanted to seek the void. It was
plain he would need every shred of ability he could muster, and
even then his chances of leaving the room alive would be small. He
had to leave alive. Egwene was almost close enough for him to shout
to her, and he had to free her, somehow. But <em>saidin</em> waited
in the void. The thought made his heart leap with eagerness at the
same time that it turned his stomach. But just as close as Egwene
were those other women. <em>Damane</em>. If he touched <em>
saidin</em>, and if he could not stop himself channeling, they
would know, Verin had told him. Know and wonder. So many, so close.
He might survive Turak only to die facing <em>damane</em>, and he
could not die before Egwene was free. Rand raised his blade.</p>

<p>Turak glided toward him on silent feet. Blade rang on
blade like hammer on anvil.</p>

<p>From the first it was clear to Rand that the man was
testing him, pushing only hard enough to see what he could do, then
pushing a little harder, then just a little harder still. It was
quick wrists and quick feet that kept Rand alive as much as skill.
Without the void, he was always half a heartbeat behind. The tip of
Turak&rsquo;s heavy sword made a stinging trench just under his left eye.
A flap of coat sleeve hung away from his shoulder, the darker for
being wet. Under a neat slash beneath his right arm, precise as a
tailor&rsquo;s cut, he could feel warm dampness spreading down his
ribs.</p>

<p>There was disappointment on the High Lord&rsquo;s face. He
stepped back with a gesture of disgust. &ldquo;Where did you find that
blade, boy? Or do they here truly award the heron to those no more
skilled than you? No matter. Make your peace. It is time to die.&rdquo;
He came on again.</p>

<p>The void enveloped Rand. <em>Saidin</em> flowed
toward him, glowing with the promise of the One Power, but he
ignored it. It was no more difficult than ignoring a barbed thorn
twisting in his flesh. He refused to be filled with the Power,
refused to be one with the male half of the True Source. He was one
with the sword in his hands, one with the floor beneath his feet,
one with the walls. One with Turak.</p>

<p>He recognized the forms the High Lord used; they were
a little different from what he had been taught, but not enough.
The Swallow Takes Flight met Parting the Silk. Moon on the Water
met The Wood Grouse Dances. Ribbon in the Air met Stones Falling
From the Cliff. They moved about the room as in a dance, and their
music was steel against steel.</p>

<p>Disappointment and disgust faded from Turak&rsquo;s dark
eyes, replaced by surprise, then concentration. Sweat appeared on
the High Lord&rsquo;s face as he pressed Rand harder. Lightning of Three
Prongs met Leaf on the Breeze.</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s thoughts floated outside the void, apart from
himself, hardly noticed. It was not enough. He faced a blademaster,
and with the void and every ounce of his skill he was barely
managing to hold his own. Barely. He had to end it before Turak
finally did. Saidin? <em>No! Sometimes it is necessary to Sheath
the Sword in your own flesh</em>. But that would not help Egwene,
either. He had to end it now. Now.</p>

<p>Turak&rsquo;s eyes widened as Rand glided forward. So far
he had only defended; now he attacked, all out. The Boar Rushes
Down the Mountain. Every movement of his blade was an attempt to
reach the High Lord; now all Turak could do was retreat and defend,
down the length of the room, almost to the door.</p>

<p>In an instant, while Turak still tried to face the
Boar, Rand charged. The River Undercuts the Bank. He dropped to one
knee, blade slashing across. He did not need Turak&rsquo;s gasp, or the
feel of resistance to his cut to know. He heard two thumps and
turned his head, knowing what he would see. He looked down the
length of his blade, wet and red, to where the High Lord lay, sword
tumbled from his limp hand, a dark dampness staining the birds
woven in the carpet under his body. Turak&rsquo;s eyes were still open,
but already filmed with death.</p>

<p>The void shook. He had faced Trollocs before, faced
Shadowspawn. Never before had he confronted a human being with a
sword except in practice or bluff. <em>I just killed a man</em>.
The void shook, and <em>saidin</em> tried to fill him.</p>

<p>Desperately he clawed free, breathing hard as he
looked around. He gave a start when he saw the two servants still
kneeling beside the door. He had forgotten them, and now he did not
know what to do about them. Neither man appeared armed, yet all
they had to do was shout&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They never looked at him, or at each other. Instead,
they stared silently at the High Lord&rsquo;s body. They produced daggers
from under their robes, and he tightened his grip on the sword, but
each man placed the point to his own breast. &ldquo;From birth to death,&rdquo;
they intoned in unison, &ldquo;I serve the Blood.&rdquo; And plunged the
daggers into their own hearts. They folded forward almost
peacefully, heads to the floor as if bowing deeply to their
lord.</p>

<p>Rand stared at them in disbelief. <em>Mad</em>, he
thought. <em>Maybe I will go mad, but they already were</em>.</p>

<p>He was getting to his feet shakily when Ingtar and
the others came running back. They all bore nicks and cuts; the
leather of Ingtar&rsquo;s coat was stained in more than one place. Mat
still had the Horn and his dagger, its blade darker than the ruby
in its hilt. Perrin&rsquo;s axe was red, too, and he looked as if he
might be sick at any moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You dealt with them?&rdquo; Ingtar said, looking at the
bodies. &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;re done, if no alarm is given. Those fools never
cried for help, not once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will see if the guards heard anything,&rdquo; Hurin
said, and darted for the window.</p>

<p>Mat shook his head. &ldquo;Rand, these people are crazy. I
know I&rsquo;ve said that before, but these people really are. Those
servants&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Rand held his breath, wondering if they had all
killed themselves. Mat said, &ldquo;Whenever they saw us fighting, they
fell on their knees, put their faces to the floor, and wrapped
their arms around their heads. They never moved, or cried out;
never tried to help the soldiers, or give an alarm. They&rsquo;re still
there, as far as I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not count on them staying on their knees,&rdquo;
Ingtar said dryly. &ldquo;We are leaving now, as fast as we can run.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;Egwene&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You fool!&rdquo; Ingtar snapped. &ldquo;We have what we came
for. The Horn of Valere. The hope of salvation. What can one girl
count, even if you love her, alongside the Horn, and what it stands
for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Dark One can have the Horn for all I care! What
does finding the Horn count if I abandon Egwene to this? If I did
that, the Horn couldn&rsquo;t save me. The Creator couldn&rsquo;t save me. I
would damn myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ingtar stared at him, his face unreadable. &ldquo;You mean
that exactly, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s happening out here,&rdquo; Hurin said
urgently. &ldquo;A man just came running up, and they&rsquo;re all milling like
fish in a bucket. Wait. The officer is coming inside!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; Ingtar said. He tried to take the Horn, but Mat
was already running. Rand hesitated, but Ingtar grabbed his arm and
pulled him into the hall. The others were streaming after Mat;
Perrin only gave Rand one pained look before he went. &ldquo;You cannot
save the girl if you stand here and die!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He ran with them. Part of him hated himself for
running, but another part whispered, <em>I&rsquo;ll come back. I&rsquo;ll free
her somehow</em>.</p>

<p>By the time they reached the bottom of the narrow,
winding staircase, he could hear a man&rsquo;s deep voice raised in the
front part of the house, angrily demanding that someone stand up
and speak. A serving girl in her nearly transparent robe knelt at
the bottom of the stairs, and a gray-haired woman all in white
wool, with a long floury apron, knelt by the kitchen door. They
were both exactly as Mat had described, faces to the floor and arms
wrapped around their heads, and they did not stir a hair as Rand
and the others hurried by. He was relieved to see the motions of
breathing.</p>

<p>They crossed the garden at a dead run, climbing over
the back wall rapidly. Ingtar cursed when Mat tossed the Horn of
Valere ahead of him, and tried again to take it when he dropped
outside, but Mat snatched it up with a quick, &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t even
scratched,&rdquo; and scampered up the alley.</p>

<p>More shouts rose from the house they had just left; a
woman screamed, and someone began tolling a gong.</p>

<p><em>I will come back for her. Somehow</em>. Rand sped
after the others as fast as he could.</p>
