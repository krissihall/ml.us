<h4><em>Cairhien</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
city of Cairhien lay across hills against the
River Alguenya, and Rand&rsquo;s first sight of it came from the hills to
the north, by the light of the midday sun. Elricain Tavolin and the
fifty Cairhienin soldiers still seemed like guards to him&mdash;the more since crossing the bridge at the Gaelin; they became more
stiff the further south they rode&mdash;but Loial and Hurin did
not appear to mind, so he tried not to. He studied the city, as
large as any he had seen. Fat ships and broad barges filled the
river, and tall granaries sprawled along the far bank, but Cairhien
seemed to be laid out in a precise grid behind its high, gray
walls. Those walls themselves made a perfect square, with one side
hard along the river. In just as exact a pattern, towers rose
within the walls, soaring as much as twenty times the height of the
wall, yet even from the hills Rand could see that each one ended in
a jagged top.</p>

<p>Outside the city walls, surrounding them from
riverbank to riverbank, lay a warren of streets, crisscrossing at
all angles and teeming with people. Foregate, Rand knew it was
called, from Hurin; once there had been a market village for every
city gate, but over the years they had all grown into one, a
hodgepodge of streets and alleys growing up every which way.</p>

<p>As Rand and the others rode into those dirt streets,
Tavolin put some of his soldiers to clearing a path through the
throng, shouting and urging their horses forward as if to trample
any who did not get out of the way quickly. People moved aside with
no more than a glance, as if it were an everyday occurrence. Rand
found himself smiling, though.</p>

<p>The Foregate people&rsquo;s clothes were shabby more often
than not, yet much of it was colorful, and there was a raucous
bustle of life to the place. Hawkers cried their wares, and
shopkeepers called for people to examine the goods displayed on
tables before their shops. Barbers, fruit-peddlers,
knife-sharpeners, men and women offering a dozen services and a
hundred things for sale, wandered through the crowds. Music drifted
through the babble from more than one structure; at first Rand
thought they were inns, but the signs out front all showed men
playing flutes or harps, tumbling or juggling, and large as they
were, they had no windows. Most of the buildings in Foregate seemed
to be wood, however big they were, and a good many looked new, if
poorly made. Rand gaped at several that stood seven stories or
more; they swayed slightly, though the people hurrying in and out
did not seem to notice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peasants,&rdquo; Tavolin muttered, staring straight ahead
in disgust. &ldquo;Look at them, corrupted by outland ways. They should
not be here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where should they be?&rdquo; Rand asked. The Cairhienin
officer glared at him and spurred his horse forward, flogging at
the crowd with his quirt.</p>

<p>Hurin touched Rand&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;It was the Aiel War, Lord
Rand.&rdquo; He looked to make sure none of the soldiers were close
enough to hear. &ldquo;Many of the farmers were afraid to go back to
their lands near the Spine of the World, and they all came here,
near enough. That&rsquo;s why Galldrian has the river full of grain
barges up from Andor and Tear. There&rsquo;s no crops coming from farms
in the east because there aren&rsquo;t any farms anymore. Best not to
mention it to a Cairhienin though, my Lord. They like to pretend
the war never happened, or at least that they won it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite Tavolin&rsquo;s quirt, they were forced to halt
while a strange procession crossed their path. Half a dozen men,
beating tambours and dancing, led the way for a string of huge
puppets, each half again as tall as the men who worked them with
long poles. Giant crowned figures of men and women in long, ornate
robes bowed to the crowd amid the shapes of fanciful beasts. A lion
with wings. A goat, walking on its hind legs, with two heads, both
of which were apparently meant to be breathing fire, from the
crimson streamers hanging from the two mouths. Something that
seemed to be half cat and half eagle, and another with a bear&rsquo;s
head on a man&rsquo;s body, which Rand took to be a Trolloc. The crowd
cheered and laughed as they pranced by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Man who made that never saw a Trolloc,&rdquo; Hurin
grumbled. &ldquo;Head&rsquo;s too big, and it&rsquo;s too skinny. Likely didn&rsquo;t
believe in them, either, my Lord, any more than in those other
things. The only monsters these Foregate folk believe in are
Aiel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are they having a festival?&rdquo; Rand asked. He did not
see any sign of it other than the procession, but he thought that
there must be a reason for that. Tavolin ordered his soldiers
forward again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more than every day, Rand,&rdquo; Loial said. Walking
alongside his horse, the blanket-wrapped chest still strapped to
his saddle, the Ogier drew as many looks as the puppets had. Some
even laughed and clapped as they had for the puppets. &ldquo;I fear
Galldrian keeps his people quiet by entertaining them. He gives
gleemen and musicians the King&rsquo;s Gift, a bounty in silver, to
perform here in the Foregate, and he sponsors horse races down by
the river every day. There are fireworks many nights, too.&rdquo; He
sounded disgusted. &ldquo;Elder Haman says Galldrian is a disgrace.&rdquo; He
blinked, realizing what he had said, and looked around hurriedly to
see if any of the soldiers had heard. None seemed to have.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fireworks,&rdquo; Hurin said, nodding. &ldquo;The Illuminators
have built a chapter house here, I&rsquo;ve heard, the same as in
Tanchico. I didn&rsquo;t half mind seeing the fireworks, when I was here
before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shook his head. He had never seen fireworks
elaborate enough to require even one Illuminator. He had heard they
only left Tanchico to put on displays for rulers. It was a strange
place he was coming to.</p>

<p>At the tall, square archway of the city gate,
Tavolin ordered a halt and dismounted by a squat stone building
just inside the walls. It had arrowslits instead of windows, and a
heavy, iron-bound door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A moment, my Lord Rand,&rdquo; the officer said. Tossing
his reins to one of the soldiers, he disappeared inside.</p>

<p>With a wary look at the soldiers&mdash;they sat
their horses rigidly in two long files; Rand wondered what they
would do if he and Loial and Hurin tried to leave&mdash;he took
the opportunity to study the city that lay before him.</p>

<p>Cairhien proper was a sharp contrast to the chaotic
bustle of the Foregate. Broad, paved streets, wide enough to make
the people in them seem fewer than they were, crossed each other at
right angles. Just as in Tremonsien, the hills had been carved and
terraced to straight lines. Closed sedan chairs, some with small
pennants bearing the sigil of a House, moved with deliberateness,
and carriages rolled down the streets slowly. People went silently
in dark clothes, with no bright colors except here and there
slashes across the breast of coat or dress. The more slashes, the
more proudly the wearer moved, but no one laughed, or even smiled.
The buildings on their terraces were all of stone, and the
ornamentation was straight-lined and sharp-angled. There were no
hawkers or peddlers in the streets, and even the shops seemed
subdued, with only small signs and no wares displayed outside.</p>

<p>He could see the great towers more clearly, now.
Scaffolds of lashed poles surrounded them, and workmen swarmed on
the scaffolding, laying new stones to push the towers higher
still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Topless Towers of Cairhien,&rdquo; Loial murmured
sadly. &ldquo;Well, they were tall enough to warrant the name, once. When
the Aiel took Cairhien, about the time you were born, the towers
burned, and cracked, and fell. I don&rsquo;t see any Ogier among the
stonemasons. No Ogier could like working here&mdash;the Cairhienin
want what they want, without embellishment&mdash;but there were
Ogier when I was here before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tavolin came out, trailing another officer and two
clerks, one carrying a large, wood-bound ledger and the other a
tray with writing implements. The front of the officer&rsquo;s head was
shaven like Tavolin&rsquo;s, though advancing baldness seemed to have
taken more hair than the razor. Both officers looked from the Rand
to the chest hidden by Loial&rsquo;s striped blanket and back again.
Neither asked what was under the blanket. Tavolin had looked at it
often on the way from Tremonsien, but he had never asked, either.
The balding man looked at Rand&rsquo;s sword, too, and pursed his lips
for an instant.</p>

<p>Tavolin gave the other officer&rsquo;s name as Asan
Sandair, and announced loudly, &ldquo;Lord Rand of House al&rsquo;Thor, in
Andor, and his man, called Hurin, with Loial, an Ogier of Stedding
Shangtai.&rdquo; The clerk with the ledger opened it across his two arms,
and Sandair wrote the names in a round hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must return to this guardhouse by this same hour
tomorrow, my Lord,&rdquo; Sandair said, leaving the sanding to the second
clerk, &ldquo;and give the name of the inn where you are staying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand looked at the staid streets of Cairhien, then
back at the liveliness of the Foregate. &ldquo;Can you tell me the name
of a good inn out there?&rdquo; He nodded to the Foregate.</p>

<p>Hurin made a frantic <em>hsst</em> and leaned close.
&ldquo;It would not be proper, Lord Rand,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;If you stay in
the Foregate, being a lord and all, they&rsquo;ll be sure you are up to
something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand could see the sniffer was right. Sandair&rsquo;s mouth
had dropped open and Tavolin&rsquo;s brows had risen at his question, and
they were both still watching him intently. He wanted to tell them
he was not playing their Great Game, but instead he said, &ldquo;We will
take rooms in the city. We can go now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, my Lord Rand.&rdquo; Sandair made a bow. &ldquo;But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the inn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will let you know when we find one.&rdquo; Rand turned
Red, then paused. Selene&rsquo;s note crackled in his pocket. &ldquo;I need to
find a young woman from Cairhien. The Lady Selene. She is my age,
and beautiful. I don&rsquo;t know her House.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sandair and Tavolin exchanged looks, then Sandair
said, &ldquo;I will make inquiries, my Lord. Perhaps I will be able to
tell you something when you come tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand nodded and led Loial and Hurin into the city.
They attracted little notice, though there were few riders. Even
Loial attracted almost none. The people seemed nearly ostentatious
about minding their own business.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will they take it the wrong way,&rdquo; Rand asked Hurin,
&ldquo;my asking after Selene?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who can say with Cairhienin, Lord Rand? They seem to
think everything has to do with <em>Daes Dae&rsquo;mar</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shrugged. He felt as if people were looking at
him. He could not wait to get a good, plain coat again, and stop
pretending to be what he was not.</p>

<p>Hurin knew several inns in the city, though his time
in Cairhien had been spent mainly in the Foregate. The sniffer led
them to one called The Defender of the Dragonwall, the sign bearing
a crowned man with his foot on another man&rsquo;s chest and his sword at
the man&rsquo;s throat. The fellow on his back had red hair.</p>

<p>A hostler came to take their horses, darting quick
looks at Rand and at Loial when he thought he was not observed.
Rand told himself to stop having fancies; not everyone in the city
could be playing this Game of theirs. And if they were, he was no
part of it.</p>

<p>The common room was neat, with the tables laid out as
strictly as the city, and only a few people at them. They glanced
up at the newcomers, then back to their wine immediately; Rand had
the feeling they were still watching, though, and listening. A
small fire burned in the big fireplace, though the day was
warming.</p>

<p>The innkeeper was a plump, unctuous man with a single
stripe of green across his dark gray coat. He gave a start at his
first sight of them, and Rand was not surprised. Loial, with the
chest in his arms under its striped blanket, had to duck his head
to make it in through the door, Hurin was burdened with all their
saddlebags and bundles, and his own red coat was a sharp contrast
to the somber colors the people at the tables wore.</p>

<p>The innkeeper took in Rand&rsquo;s coat and his sword, and
his oily smile came back. He bowed, washing his smooth hands.
&ldquo;Forgive me, my Lord. It was just that for a moment I took you for&mdash;Forgive me. My brain is not what it was. You wish rooms, my
Lord?&rdquo; He added another, lesser bow for Loial. &ldquo;I am called Cuale,
my Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>He thought I was Aiel</em>, Rand thought sourly.
He wanted to be gone from Cairhien. But it was the one place Ingtar
might find them. And Selene had said she would wait for him in
Cairhien.</p>

<p>It took a little time for their rooms to be readied,
Cuale explaining with too many smiles and bows that it was
necessary to move a bed for Loial. Rand wanted them all to share a
room again, but between the innkeeper&rsquo;s scandalized looks and
Hurin&rsquo;s insistence&mdash;&ldquo;We have to show these Cairhienin we know
what&rsquo;s right as well as they do, Lord Rand&rdquo;&mdash;they ended with
two, one for him alone, with a connecting door.</p>

<p>The rooms were much the same except that theirs had
two beds, one sized for an Ogier, while his had only one bed, and
that almost as big as the other two, with massive square posts that
nearly reached the ceiling. His tall-backed, padded chair and the
washstand were square and massive, too, and the wardrobe standing
against his wall was carved in a heavy, rigid style that made the
thing look ready enough to fall over on him. A pair of windows
siding his bed looked out on the street, two floors below.</p>

<p>As soon as the innkeeper left, Rand opened the door
and admitted Loial and Hurin into his room. &ldquo;This place gnaws at
me,&rdquo; he told them. &ldquo;Everybody looks at you as if they think you&rsquo;re
doing something. I&rsquo;m going back to the Foregate, for an hour
anyway. At least the people laugh, there. Which of you is willing
to take the first watch on the Horn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will stay,&rdquo; Loial said quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like a chance
to do a little reading. Just because I didn&rsquo;t see any Ogier does
not mean there are no stonemasons down from Stedding Tsofu. It is
not far from the city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d think you would want to meet them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;no, Rand. They asked enough questions the
last time about why I was outside alone as it was. If they&rsquo;ve had
word from Stedding Shangtai&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Well, I will just rest here and
read, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shook his head. He often forgot that Loial had
run away from home, in effect, to see the world. &ldquo;What about you,
Hurin? There&rsquo;s music in the Foregate, and people laughing. I&rsquo;ll
wager no one is playing <em>Daes Dae&rsquo;mar</em> there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not be so certain of that myself, Lord Rand.
In any case, I thank you for the invitation, but I think not.
There&rsquo;s so many fights&mdash;and killings, too&mdash;in Foregate,
that it stinks, if you know what I mean. Not that they&rsquo;re likely to
bother a lord, of course; the soldiers would be down on them if
they did. But if it pleases you, I would like to have a drink in
the common room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurin, you don&rsquo;t need my permission for anything.
You know that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you say, my Lord.&rdquo; The sniffer gave a suggestion
of a bow.</p>

<p>Rand took a deep breath. If they did not leave
Cairhien soon, Hurin would be bowing and scraping left and right.
And if Mat and Perrin saw that, they would never let him forget it.
&ldquo;I hope nothing delays Ingtar. If he doesn&rsquo;t come quickly, we&rsquo;ll
have to take the Horn back to Fal Dara ourselves.&rdquo; He touched
Selene&rsquo;s note through his coat. &ldquo;We will have to. Loial, I&rsquo;ll come
back so you can see some of the city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not risk it,&rdquo; Loial said.</p>

<p>Hurin accompanied Rand downstairs. As soon as they
reached the common room, Cuale was bowing in front of Rand, pushing
a tray at him. Three folded and sealed parchments lay on the tray.
Rand took them, since that was what the innkeeper seemed to intend.
They were a fine grade of parchment, soft and smooth to his touch.
Expensive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are these?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>Cuale bowed again. &ldquo;Invitations, of course, my Lord.
From three of the noble Houses.&rdquo; He bowed himself away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who would send me invitations?&rdquo; Rand turned them
over in his hand. None of the men at the tables looked up, but he
had the feeling they were watching just the same. He did not
recognize the seals. None was the crescent moon and stars Selene
had used. &ldquo;Who would know I was here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everyone by now, Lord Rand,&rdquo; Hurin said quietly. He
seemed to feel eyes watching, too. &ldquo;The guards at the gate would
not keep their mouths closed about an outland lord coming to
Cairhien. The hostler, the innkeeper&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;everybody tells what
they know where they think it will do them the most good, my
Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a grimace, Rand took two steps and hurled the
invitations into the fire. They caught immediately. &ldquo;I am not
playing <em>Daes Dae&rsquo;mar</em>,&rdquo; he said, loudly enough for
everyone to hear. Not even Cuale looked at him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nothing to do
with your Great Game. I am just here to wait for some friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hurin caught his arm. &ldquo;Please, Lord Rand.&rdquo; His voice
was an urgent whisper. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t do that again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again? You really think I&rsquo;ll receive more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m certain. Light, but you mind me of the time Teva
got so mad at a hornet buzzing round his ears, he kicked the nest.
You&rsquo;ve likely just convinced everyone in the room you are in some
deep part of the Game. It must be deep, as they&rsquo;ll see it, if you
deny playing at all. <em>Every</em> lord and lady in Cairhien plays
it.&rdquo; The sniffer glanced at the invitations, curling blackly in the
fire, and winced. &ldquo;And you have surely made enemies of three
Houses. Not great Houses, or they&rsquo;d not have moved so quickly, but
still noble. You must answer any more invitations you receive, my
Lord. Decline if you will&mdash;though they&rsquo;ll read things into
whose invitations you do decline. And into whose you accept. Of
course, if you decline them all, or accept them all&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have no part of it,&rdquo; Rand said quietly. &ldquo;We are
leaving Cairhien as soon as we can.&rdquo; He thrust his fists into his
coat pockets, and felt Selene&rsquo;s note crumple. Pulling it out, he
smoothed it on his coat front. &ldquo;As soon as we can,&rdquo; he muttered,
putting it back in his pocket again. &ldquo;Have your drink, Hurin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stalked out angrily, not sure whether he was angry
with himself, or with Cairhien and its Great Game, or Selene for
vanishing, or Moiraine. She had started it all, stealing his coats
and giving him a lord&rsquo;s clothes instead. Even now that he called
himself free of them, an Aes Sedai still managed to interfere in
his life, and without even being there.</p>

<p>He went back through the same gate by which he had
entered the city, since that was the way he knew. A man standing in
front of the guardhouse took note of him&mdash;his bright coat
marked him out, as well as his height among the Cairhienin&mdash;and hurried inside, but Rand did not notice. The laughter and music
of the Foregate were pulling him on.</p>

<p>If his gold-embroidered red coat made him stand out
inside the walls, it fit right into the Foregate. Many of the men
milling through the crowded streets were dressed just as darkly as
those in the city, but just as many wore coats of red, or blue, or
green, or gold&mdash;some bright enough to be a Tinker&rsquo;s clothes&mdash;and even
more of the women had embroidered dresses and colored scarves or
shawls. Most of the finery was tattered and ill-fitting, as if made
for someone else originally, but if some of those who wore it eyed
his fine coat, none seemed to take it amiss.</p>

<p>Once he had to stop for another procession of giant
puppets. While the drummers beat their tambours and capered, a
pig-faced Trolloc with tusks fought a man in a crown. After a few
desultory blows, the Trolloc collapsed to laughter and cheers from
the onlookers.</p>

<p>Rand grunted. <em>They don&rsquo;t die so easily as
that</em>.</p>

<p>He glanced into one of the large, windowless
buildings, stopping to look through the door. To his surprise, it
seemed to be one huge room, open to the sky in the middle and lined
with balconies, with a large dais at one end. He had never seen or
heard of anything like it. People jammed the balconies and the
floor watching people perform on the dais. He peeked into others as
he passed them, and saw jugglers, and musicians, any number of
tumblers, and even a gleeman, with his cloak of patches, declaiming
a story from <em>The Great Hunt of the Horn</em> in sonorous-voice
High Chant.</p>

<p>That made him think of Thom Merrilin, and he hurried
on. Memories of Thom were always sad. Thom had been a friend. A
friend who had died for him. <em>While I ran away and let him
die</em>.</p>

<p>In another of the big structures, a woman in
voluminous white robes appeared to make things vanish from one
basket and appear in another, then disappear from her hands in
great puffs of smoke. The crowd watching her <em>oohed</em> and
<em>aahed</em> loudly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two coppers, my good Lord,&rdquo; a ratty little man in
the doorway said. &ldquo;Two coppers to see the Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo; Rand glanced back at the woman. A
white dove had appeared in her hands. <em>Aes Sedai?</em> &ldquo;No.&rdquo; He
gave the ratty man a small bow and left.</p>

<p>He was making his way through the throng, wondering
what to see next, when a deep voice, accompanied by the plucking of
a harp, drifted out from a doorway with the sign of a juggler over
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;cold blows the wind down Shara Pass; cold lies
the grave unmarked. Yet every year at Sunday, upon those piled
stones appears a single rose, one crystal teardrop like dew upon
the petals, laid by the fair hand of Dunsinin, for she keeps fast
to the bargain made by Rogosh Eagle-eye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The voice drew Rand like a rope. He pushed through
the doorway as applause rose within.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two coppers, my good Lord,&rdquo; said a rat-faced man who
could have been twin to the other. &ldquo;Two coppers to see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand dug out some coins and thrust them at the man.
He walked on in a daze, staring at the man bowing on the dais to
the clapping of his listeners, cradling his harp in one arm and
with the other spreading his patch-covered cloak as if to trap all
the sound they made. He was a tall man, lanky and not young, with
long mustaches as white as the hair on his head. And when he
straightened and saw Rand, the eyes that widened were sharp and
blue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thom.&rdquo; Rand&rsquo;s whisper was lost in the noise of the
crowd.</p>

<p>Holding Rand&rsquo;s eye, Thom Merrilin nodded slightly
toward a small door beside the dais. Then he was bowing again,
smiling and basking in the applause.</p>

<p>Rand made his way to the door and through it. It was
only a small hallway, with three steps leading up to the dais. In
the other direction from the dais Rand could see a juggler
practicing with colored balls, and six tumblers limbering
themselves.</p>

<p>Thom appeared on the steps, limping as though his
right leg did not bend as well as it had. He eyed the juggler and
the tumblers, blew out his mustaches disdainfully, and turned to
Rand. &ldquo;All they want to hear is <em>The Great Hunt of the
Horn</em>. You would think, with the news from Haddon Mirk and
Saldaea, one of them would ask for <em>The Karaethon Cycle</em>.
Well, maybe not that, but I&rsquo;d pay myself to tell something else.&rdquo;
He looked Rand up and down. &ldquo;You look as if you&rsquo;re doing well,
boy.&rdquo; He fingered Rand&rsquo;s collar and pursed his lips. &ldquo;Very
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand could not help laughing. &ldquo;I left Whitebridge
sure you were dead. Moiraine said you were still alive, but I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Light, Thom, it&rsquo;s good to see you again! I should have gone back to
help you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bigger fool if you had, boy. That Fade&rdquo;&mdash;he
looked around; there was no one close enough to hear, but he
lowered his voice anyway&mdash;&ldquo;had no interest in me. It left me
a little present of a stiff leg and ran off after you and Mat. All
you could have done was die.&rdquo; He paused, looking thoughtful.
&ldquo;Moiraine said I was still alive, did she? Is she with you,
then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shook his head. To his surprise, Thom seemed
disappointed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too bad, in a way. She&rsquo;s a fine woman, even if she
is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He left it unsaid. &ldquo;So it was Mat or Perrin she was
after. I won&rsquo;t ask which. They were good boys, and I don&rsquo;t want to
know.&rdquo; Rand shifted uneasily, and gave a start when Thom fixed him
with a bony finger. &ldquo;What I do want to know is, do you still have
my harp and flute? I want them back, boy. What I have now are not
fit for a pig to play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have them, Thom. I&rsquo;ll bring them to you, I
promise. I can&rsquo;t believe you are alive. And I can&rsquo;t believe you
aren&rsquo;t in Illian. The Great Hunt setting out. The prize for the
best telling of <em>The Great Hunt of the Horn</em>. You were dying
to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom snorted. &ldquo;After Whitebridge? Likely I&rsquo;d die if I
did go. Even if I could have reached the boat before it sailed,
Domon and his whole crew would be spreading the tale all over
Illian about how I was being chased by Trollocs. If they saw the
Fade, or heard of it, before Domon cut his lines&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Most
Illianers think Trollocs and Fades are fables, but enough others
might want to know why a man was pursued by them to make Illian
somewhat more than uncomfortable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thom, I have so much to tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gleeman cut him off. &ldquo;Later, boy.&rdquo; He was
exchanging glares down the length of the hall with the narrow-faced
