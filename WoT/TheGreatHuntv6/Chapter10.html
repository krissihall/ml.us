<h4><em>The Hunt Begins</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">I</span>ngtar
set a fast pace for the beginning of along
journey, fast enough that Rand worried a little about the horses.
The animals could keep up the trot for hours, but there was still
most of the day ahead, and likely days more beyond that. The way
Ingtar&rsquo;s face was set, though, Rand thought he might intend to
catch those who had stolen the Horn in the first day, in the first
hour. Remembering his voice when he swore his oath to the Amyrlin
Seat, Rand would not have been surprised. He kept his mouth shut,
though. It was Lord Ingtar&rsquo;s command; as friendly as he had been to
Rand, he still would not appreciate a shepherd giving advice.</p>

<p>Hurin rode a pace behind Ingtar, but it was the
sniffer who led them south, pointing the way for Ingtar. The land
was rolling, forested hills, thick with fir and leatherleaf and
oak, but the path Hurin set led almost straight as an arrow, never
wavering except to go around a few of the taller hills, where the
way was clearly quicker around than over. The Gray Owl banner
rippled in the wind.</p>

<p>Rand tried to ride with Mat and Perrin, but when Rand
let his horse drop back to them, Mat nudged Perrin, and Perrin
reluctantly galloped to the head of the column with Mat. Telling
himself there was no point riding at the back by himself, Rand rode
back to the front. They fell to the rear again, Mat again urging
Perrin.</p>

<p><em>Burn them. I only want to apologize</em>. He felt
alone. It did not help that he knew it was his own fault.</p>

<p>Atop one hill, Uno dismounted to examine ground
churned by hooves. He poked at some horse droppings and grunted.
&ldquo;Bloody well moving fast, my Lord.&rdquo; He had a voice that sounded as
if he were shouting when he was just speaking. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve not made up
an hour on them. Burn me, we may have lost a flaming hour. They&rsquo;ll
kill their bloody horses, the way they&rsquo;re going.&rdquo; He fingered a
hoofed track. &ldquo;No horse, that. Bloody Trolloc. Some flaming goat
feet over there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will catch them,&rdquo; Ingtar said grimly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our horses, my Lord. Does no good to ride them into
the bloody ground before we do catch up, my Lord. Even if they do
kill their horses, bloody Trollocs can keep going longer than
horses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will catch them. Mount, Uno.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uno looked at Rand with his one eye, then shrugged
and climbed into his saddle. Ingtar took them down the far slope at
a run, half sliding all the way to the bottom, and galloped up the
next.</p>

<p><em>Why did he look at me that way</em>, Rand
wondered. Uno was one of those who had never shown much
friendliness toward him. It was not like Masema&rsquo;s open dislike; Uno
was not friendly with anyone except a few veterans as grizzled as
himself. <em>Surely</em> he <em>doesn&rsquo;t believe that tale about me
being a lord</em>.</p>

<p>Uno spent his time studying the country ahead, but
when he caught Rand looking at him, he gave back stare for stare,
and never said a word. It did not mean much. He would stare Ingtar
in the eye, too. That was Uno&rsquo;s way.</p>

<p>The path chosen by the Darkfriends&mdash;<em>And
what else</em>, Rand wondered; Hurin kept muttering about
&ldquo;something worse&rdquo;&mdash;who had stolen the Horn never came close
to any village. Rand saw villages, from one hilltop to another,
with a mile or more of up-and-down country between, but there was
never one close enough to make out the people in the streets. Or
close enough for those people to make out a party heading south.
There were farms, too, with low-eaved houses and tall barns and
smoking chimneys, on hilltops and on hillsides and in the bottoms,
but never one close enough for the farmer to have seen their
quarry.</p>

<p>Eventually even Ingtar had to realize that the horses
could not keep on as they were going. Rand heard muttered curses,
and Ingtar pounded his thigh with a gauntleted fist, but finally he
ordered everyone to dismount. They trotted, leading their horses,
uphill and down, for a mile, then mounted and rode again. Then it
was down again and trot. Trot a mile, then ride a mile. Trot, then
ride.</p>

<p>Rand was surprised to see Loial grinning when they
were down on the ground, toiling up a hill. The Ogier had been
uneasy about riding and horses when they first met, preferring to
trust to his own feet, but Rand thought he had long gotten over
that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you like to run, Rand?&rdquo; Loial laughed. &ldquo;I do. I
was the fastest in Stedding Shangtai. I outran a horse, once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand only shook his head. He did not want to waste
breath on talk. He looked for Mat and Perrin, but they were still
at the back, too many men between for Rand to make them out. He
wondered how the Shienarans could manage this in their armor. Not a
one of them slowed or voiced a complaint. Uno did not even look as
if he were breaking a sweat, and the bannerman never let the Gray
Owl waver.</p>

<p>It was a quick pace, but twilight began to close
without any sight of those they hunted except their tracks. At
last, reluctantly, Ingtar called a halt to make camp for the night
in the forest. The Shienarans went about getting fires started and
setting picket-lines for the horses with a smooth economy of effort
born of long experience. Ingtar posted six guards, in pairs, for
the first watch.</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s first order of business was finding his bundle
in the wicker panniers from the packhorses. It was not hard&mdash;there were few personal bundles among the supplies&mdash;but when
he had it open, he let out a shout that brought every man in the
camp erect with sword in hand.</p>

<p>Ingtar came running. &ldquo;What is it? Peace, did someone
get through? I did not hear the guards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s these coats,&rdquo; Rand growled, still staring at
what he had unpacked. One coat was black, embroidered with silver
thread, the other white worked in gold. Both had herons on the
collars, and both were at least as ornate as the scarlet coat he
was wearing. &ldquo;The servants told me I had two good, serviceable
coats in here. Look at them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ingtar sheathed his sword over his shoulder. The
other men began to settle back down. &ldquo;Well, they are
serviceable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wear these. I can&rsquo;t go around dressed like
this all the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can wear them. A coat&rsquo;s a coat. I understand
Moiraine Sedai herself saw to your packing. Maybe Aes Sedai do not
exactly understand what a man wears in the field.&rdquo; Ingtar grinned.
&ldquo;After we catch these Trollocs, perhaps we&rsquo;ll have a feast. You
will be dressed for it, at least, even if the rest of us are not.&rdquo;
He strolled back to where the cook fires were already burning.</p>

<p>Rand had not moved since Ingtar mentioned Moiraine.
He stared at the coats. <em>What is she doing? Whatever it is, I
will not be used</em>. He bundled everything together again and
stuffed the bundle back into the pannier. <em>I can always go
naked</em>, he thought bitterly.</p>

<p>Shienarans took turns at the cooking when they were
in the field, and Masema was stirring the kettle when Rand returned
to the fires. The smell of a stew made from turnips, onions, and
dried meat settled over the camp. Ingtar was served first, and then
Uno, but everyone else stood in line however they happened to come.
Masema slopped a big ladle of stew on Rand&rsquo;s plate; Rand stepped
back quickly to keep from getting the overflow on his coat, and
made room for the next man while sucking a burned thumb. Masema
stared at him, with a fixed grin that never reached his eyes. Until
Uno stepped up and cuffed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t bloody bring enough for you to be spilling
it on the flaming ground.&rdquo; The one-eyed man looked at Rand and
left. Masema rubbed his ear, but his glare followed Rand.</p>

<p>Rand went to join Ingtar and Loial, sitting on the
ground under a spreading oak. Ingtar had his helmet off, on the
ground beside him, but otherwise he was fully armored. Mat and
Perrin were already there, eating hungrily. Mat gave a broad sneer
at Rand&rsquo;s coat, but Perrin barely looked up, golden eyes shining in
the half-light from the fires, before bending back to his
plate.</p>

<p><em>At least they didn&rsquo;t leave this time</em>.</p>

<p>He sat cross-legged on the other side of Ingtar from
them. &ldquo;I wish I knew why Uno keeps looking at me. It&rsquo;s probably
this bloody coat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ingtar paused thoughtfully around a mouthful of stew.
Finally he said, &ldquo;Uno no doubt wonders if you are worthy of a
heron-mark blade.&rdquo; Mat snorted loudly, but Ingtar went on
unperturbed. &ldquo;Do not let Uno upset you. He would treat Lord Agelmar
like a raw recruit if he could. Well, perhaps not Agelmar, but
anyone else. He has a tongue like a file, but he gives good advice.
He should; he&rsquo;s been campaigning since before I was born. Listen to
his advice, don&rsquo;t mind his tongue, and you will do all right with
Uno.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought he was like Masema.&rdquo; Rand shoveled stew
into his mouth. It was too hot, but he gulped it down. They had not
eaten since leaving Fal Dara, and he had been too worried to eat
that morning. His stomach rumbled, reminding him it was past time.
He wondered if telling Masema he liked the food would help. &ldquo;Masema
acts like he hates me, and I don&rsquo;t understand it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Masema served three years in the Eastern Marches,&rdquo;
Ingtar said. &ldquo;At Ankor Dail, against the Aiel.&rdquo; He stirred his stew
with his spoon, frowning. &ldquo;I ask no questions, mind. If Lan Dai
Shan and Moiraine Sedai want to say you are from Andor, from the
Two Rivers, then you are. But Masema can&rsquo;t get the look of the Aiel
out of his head, and when he sees you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He shrugged. &ldquo;I ask no
questions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand dropped his spoon in the plate with a sigh.
&ldquo;Everybody thinks I&rsquo;m somebody I am not. I am from the Two Rivers,
Ingtar. I grew tabac with&mdash;with my father, and tended his
sheep. That is what I am. A farmer and shepherd from the Two
Rivers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s from the Two Rivers,&rdquo; Mat said scornfully. &ldquo;I
grew up with him, though you&rsquo;d never know it now. You put this Aiel
nonsense in his head on top of what&rsquo;s already there, and the Light
knows what we&rsquo;ll have. An Aiel lord, maybe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Loial said, &ldquo;he has the look. You remember,
Rand, I remarked on it once, though I thought it was just because I
didn&rsquo;t know you humans well enough then. Remember? &lsquo;Till shade is
gone, till water is gone, into the Shadow with teeth bared,
screaming defiance with the last breath, to spit in Sightblinder&rsquo;s
eye on the Last Day.&rsquo; You remember, Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stared at his plate. <em>Wrap a</em> shoufa
<em>around your head, and you would be the image of an
Aielman</em>. That had been Gawyn, brother to Elayne, the
Daughter-Heir of Andor. <em>Everybody thinks I&rsquo;m somebody I&rsquo;m
not</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; Mat asked. &ldquo;About spitting in the
Dark One&rsquo;s eye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how long the Aiel say they&rsquo;ll fight,&rdquo; Ingtar
said, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t doubt they will. Except for peddlers and
gleemen, Aiel divide the world in two. Aiel, and enemies. They
changed that for Cairhien five hundred years ago, for some reason
no one but an Aiel could understand, but I do not think they will
ever do so again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; Loial sighed. &ldquo;But they do let the
Tuatha&rsquo;an, the Traveling People, cross the Waste. And they don&rsquo;t
see Ogier as enemies, either, though I doubt any of us would want
to go out into the Waste. Aiel come to Stedding Shangtai sometimes
to trade for sung wood. A hard people, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ingtar nodded. &ldquo;I wish I had some as hard. Half as
hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that a joke?&rdquo; Mat laughed. &ldquo;If I ran a mile
wearing all the iron you&rsquo;re wearing, I would fall down and sleep a
week. You&rsquo;ve done it mile after mile all day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aiel are hard,&rdquo; Ingtar said. &ldquo;Man and woman, hard.
I&rsquo;ve fought them, and I know. They will run fifty miles, and fight
a battle at the end of it. They&rsquo;re death walking, with any weapon
or none. Except a sword. They will not touch a sword, for some
reason. Or ride a horse, not that they need to. If you have a
sword, and the Aielman has his bare hands, it is an even fight. If
you&rsquo;re good. They herd cattle and goats where you or I would die of
thirst before the day was done. They dig their villages into huge
rock spires out in the Waste. They&rsquo;ve been there since the
Breaking, near enough. Artur Hawkwing tried to dig them out and was
bloodied, the only major defeats he ever suffered. By day the air
in the Aiel Waste shimmers with heat, and by night it freezes. And
an Aiel will give you that blue-eyed stare and tell you there is no
place on earth he would rather be. He won&rsquo;t be lying, either. If
they ever tried to come out, we would be hard-pressed to stop them.
The Aiel War lasted three years, and that was only four out of
thirteen clans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gray eyes from his mother doesn&rsquo;t make him an Aiel,&rdquo;
Mat said.</p>

<p>Ingtar shrugged. &ldquo;As I said, I ask no questions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Rand finally settled down for the night, his
head hummed with unwanted thoughts. <em>Image of an Aielman.
Moiraine Sedai wants to say you&rsquo;re from the Two Rivers. Aiel
ravaged all the way to Tar Valon. Born on the slopes of
Dragonmount. The Dragon Reborn</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not be used,&rdquo; he muttered, but sleep was a
long time coming.</p>

<p>Ingtar broke camp before the sun was up in the
morning. They had breakfasted and were riding south while the
clouds in the east were still red with sunrise to come and dew
still hung on the leaves. This time Ingtar put out scouts, and
though the pace was hard, it was no longer horse-killing. Rand
thought maybe Ingtar had realized they were not going to do it all
in a day. The trail still led south, Hurin said. Until, two hours
after the sun rose, one of the scouts came galloping back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Abandoned camp ahead, my Lord. Just on that hilltop
there. Must have been at least thirty or forty of them there last
night, my Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ingtar put spurs to horse as if he had been told the
Darkfriends were still there, and Rand had to keep pace or be
trampled by the Shienarans who galloped up the hill behind him.</p>

<p>There was not much to see. The cold ashes of
campfires, well hidden in the trees, with what looked like the
remnants of a meal tossed in them. A refuse heap too near the fires
and already buzzing with flies.</p>

<p>Ingtar kept the others back, and dismounted to walk
through the campsite with Uno, examining the ground. Hurin rode the
circumference of the site, sniffing. Rand sat his stallion with the
other men; he had no desire for any closer look at a place where
Trollocs and Darkfriends had camped. And a Fade. <em>And something
worse</em>.</p>

<p>Mat scrambled up the hill afoot and stalked into the
campsite. &ldquo;Is this what a Darkfriend camp looks like? Smells a bit,
but I can&rsquo;t say it looks any different from anybody else&rsquo;s.&rdquo; He
kicked at one of the ash heaps, knocking out a piece of burned
bone, and stooped to pick it up. &ldquo;What do Darkfriends eat? Doesn&rsquo;t
look like a sheep bone, or a cow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was murder done here,&rdquo; Hurin said mournfully.
He scrubbed at his nose with a kerchief. &ldquo;Worse than murder.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There were Trollocs here,&rdquo; Ingtar said, looking
straight at Mat. &ldquo;I suppose they got hungry, and the Darkfriends
were handy.&rdquo; Mat dropped the blackened bone; he looked as if he
were going to be sick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are not going south any longer, my Lord,&rdquo; Hurin
said. That took everyone&rsquo;s attention. He pointed back, to the
northeast. &ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;ve decided to break for the Blight after
all. Go around us. Maybe they were just trying to put us off by
coming south.&rdquo; He did not sound as if he believed it. He sounded
puzzled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever they were trying,&rdquo; Ingtar snarled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
have them now. Mount!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Little more than an hour later, though, Hurin drew
rein. &ldquo;They changed again, my Lord. South again. And they killed
someone else here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were no ashes there, in the gap between two
hills, but a few minutes&rsquo; search found the body. A man curled up
and stuffed under some bushes. The back of his head was smashed in,
and his eyes still bulged with the force of the blow. No one
recognized him, though he was wearing Shienaran clothes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll waste no time burying Darkfriends,&rdquo; Ingtar
growled. &ldquo;We ride south.&rdquo; He suited his own words almost before
they were out of his mouth.</p>

<p>The day was the same as the day before had been,
though. Uno studied tracks and droppings, and said they had gained
a little ground on their quarry. Twilight came with no sight of
Trollocs or Darkfriends, and the next morning there was another
abandoned camp&mdash;and another murder done, so Hurin said&mdash;and another change of direction, this time to the northwest. Less
than two hours on that track found another body, a man with his
skull split open by an axe, and another change of direction. South
again. Again gaining ground, by Uno&rsquo;s reading of the tracks. Again
seeing nothing but distant farms until nightfall. And the next day
was the same, changes in direction, murders and all. And the
next.</p>

<p>Every day brought them a little closer behind their
prey, but Ingtar fumed. He suggested cutting straight across when
the trail changed direction of a morning&mdash;surely they would
come on the trail heading south again, and gain more time&mdash;and before anyone could speak, he said it was a bad idea, in case
this once the men they hunted did not turn south. He urged everyone
to greater speed, to start earlier and ride till full dark. He
reminded them of the charge the Amyrlin Seat had given them, to
recover the Horn of Valere, and let nothing bar their way. He spoke
of the glory they would have, their names remembered in story and
history, in gleemen&rsquo;s tales and bards&rsquo; songs, the men who found the
Horn. He talked as if he could not stop, and he stared down the
trail they followed as if his hope of the Light lay at the end of
it. Even Uno began to look at him askance.</p>

<p>And so they came to the River Erinin.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">It could not properly be called a village at all, to
Rand&rsquo;s mind. He sat his horse among the trees, peering up at half a
dozen small houses with wood-shingled roofs and eaves almost to the
ground, on a hilltop overlooking the river beneath the morning sun.
Few people passed this way. It was only a few hours since they had
broken camp, but past time for them to have found the remains of
the Darkfriends&rsquo; resting place if the pattern held. They had seen
nothing of the sort, however.</p>

<p>The river itself was not much like the mighty Erinin
of story, here so far toward its source in the Spine of the World.
Perhaps sixty paces of swift water to the far bank, lined with
trees, and a barge-like ferry on a thick rope spanning the
distance. The ferry sat snugged against the other side.</p>

<p>For once the trail had led straight to human
habitation. Straight to the houses on the hill. No one moved on the
single dirt street around which the dwellings clustered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ambush, my Lord?&rdquo; Uno said softly.</p>

<p>Ingtar gave the necessary orders, and the Shienarans
unlimbered their lances, sweeping around to encircle the houses. At
a hand signal from Ingtar they galloped between the houses from
four directions, thundering in with eyes searching, lances ready,
dust rising under their hooves. Nothing moved but them. They drew
rein, and the dust began to settle.</p>

<p>Rand returned to his quiver the arrow he had nocked,
and slung his bow on his back again. Mat and Perrin did the same.
Loial and Hurin had just waited there where Ingtar had left them,
watching uneasily.</p>

<p>Ingtar waved, and Rand and the others rode up to join
the Shienarans.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the smell of this place,&rdquo; Perrin
muttered as they came among the houses. Hurin gave him a look, and
he stared back until Hurin dropped his eyes. &ldquo;It smells wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bloody Darkfriends and Trollocs went straight
through, my Lord,&rdquo; Uno said, pointing to a few tracks not chopped
to pieces by the Shienarans. &ldquo;Straight through to the goat-kissing
ferry, which they bloody left on the other side. Blood and bloody
ashes! We&rsquo;re flaming lucky they didn&rsquo;t cut it adrift.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are the people?&rdquo; Loial asked.</p>

<p>Doors stood open, curtains flapped at open windows,
but no one had come out for all the thunder of hooves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Search the houses,&rdquo; Ingtar commanded. Men dismounted
and ran to comply, but they came back shaking their heads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re just gone, my Lord,&rdquo; Uno said. &ldquo;Just bloody
gone, burn me. Like they&rsquo;d picked up and decided to flaming walk
away in the middle of the bloody day.&rdquo; He stopped suddenly,
pointing urgently to a house behind Ingtar. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a woman at
that window. How I bloody missed her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He was running for the
house before anyone else could move.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t frighten her!&rdquo; Ingtar shouted. &ldquo;Uno, we need
information. The Light blind you, Uno, don&rsquo;t frighten her!&rdquo; The
one-eyed man disappeared through the open door. Ingtar raised his
voice again. &ldquo;We will not harm you, good lady. We are Lord
Agelmar&rsquo;s oathmen, from Fal Dara. Do not be afraid! We will not
harm you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A window at the top of the house flew up, and Uno
stuck his head out, staring around wildly. With an oath he pulled
back. Thumps and clatters marked his passage back, as if he were
kicking things in frustration. Finally he appeared from the
doorway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone, my Lord. But she was there. A woman in a white
dress, at the window. I saw her. I even thought I saw her inside,
for a moment, but then she was gone, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He took a deep
breath. &ldquo;The house is empty, my Lord.&rdquo; It was a measure of his
agitation that he did not curse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Curtains,&rdquo; Mat muttered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s jumping at bloody
curtains.&rdquo; Uno gave him a sharp look, then returned to his
horse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did they go?&rdquo; Rand asked Loial. &ldquo;Do you think
they ran off when the Darkfriends came?&rdquo; <em>And Trollocs, and a
Myrddraal. And Hurin&rsquo;s something worse. Smart people, if they ran
as hard as they could</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear the Darkfriends took them, Rand,&rdquo; Loial said
slowly. He grimaced, almost a snarl with his broad nose like a
snout. &ldquo;For the Trollocs.&rdquo; Rand swallowed and wished he had not
asked; it was never pleasant to think on how Trollocs fed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever was done here,&rdquo; Ingtar said, &ldquo;our
Darkfriends did it. Hurin, was there violence here? Killing?
Hurin!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sniffer gave a start in his saddle and looked
around wildly. He had been staring across the river. &ldquo;Violence, my
Lord? Yes: Killing, no. Or not exactly.&rdquo; He glanced sideways at
Perrin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never smelled anything exactly like it before, my
Lord. But there was hurting done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there any doubt they crossed over? Have they
doubled back again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They crossed, my Lord.&rdquo; Hurin looked uneasily at the
far bank. &ldquo;They crossed. What they did on the other side, though&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He shrugged.</p>

<p>Ingtar nodded. &ldquo;Uno, I want that ferry back on this
side. And I want the other side scouted before we cross. Just
because there was no ambush here doesn&rsquo;t mean there will not be one
when we are split by the river. That ferry does not look big enough
to carry us all in one trip. See to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uno bowed, and in moments Ragan and Masema were
helping each other out of their armor. Stripped down to
breechclouts, with a dagger stuck behind in the small of the back,
they trotted to the river on horsemen&rsquo;s bowed legs and waded in,
beginning to work their way hand over hand along the thick rope
along which the ferry ran. The cable sagged enough in the middle to
put them in the river to their waists, and the current was strong,
pulling them downstream, yet in less time than Rand expected they
were hauling themselves over the slatted sides of the ferry.
Drawing their daggers, they disappeared into the trees.</p>

<p>After what seemed like forever, the two men
reappeared and began pulling the ferry slowly across. The barge
butted against the bank below the village, and Masema tied it off
while Ragan trotted up to where Ingtar waited. His face was pale,
the arrow scar on his cheek sharp, and he sounded shaken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The far bank&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;There is no ambush on the far
bank, my Lord, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He bowed deeply, still wet and shivering
from his excursion. &ldquo;My Lord, you must see for yourself. The big
stoneoak, fifty paces south from the landing. I cannot say the
words. You must see it yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ingtar frowned, looking from Ragan to the other bank.
Finally, he said, &ldquo;You have done well, Ragan. Both of you have.&rdquo;
His voice became more brisk. &ldquo;Find these men something to dry
themselves on from the houses, Uno. And see if anybody left water
on for tea. Put something hot into them, if you can. Then bring the
second file and the pack animals over.&rdquo; He turned to Rand. &ldquo;Well,
are you ready to see the south bank of the Erinin?&rdquo; He did not wait
for an answer, but rode down to the ferry with Hurin and half the
lancers.</p>

<p>Rand hesitated only a moment before following. Loial
went with him. To his surprise, Perrin rode down ahead of them,
looking grim. Some of the lancers, making gruff jokes, dismounted
to haul on the rope and walk the ferry over.</p>

<p>Mat waited until the last minute, when one of the
Shienarans was untying the ferry, before he kicked his horse and
crowded aboard. &ldquo;I have to come sooner or later, don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; he said,
breathless, to no one in particular. &ldquo;I have to find it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shook his head. With Mat looking as healthy as
he ever had, he had almost forgotten why he was along. <em>To find
the dagger. Let Ingtar have the Horn. I just want the dagger for
Mat</em>. &ldquo;We will find it, Mat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat scowled at him&mdash;with a sneering glance for
his fine red coat&mdash;and turned away. Rand sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will all come right, Rand,&rdquo; Loial said quietly.
&ldquo;Somehow, it will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The current took the ferry as it was hauled out from
the bank, tugging it against the cable with a sharp creak. The
lancers were odd ferrymen, walking the deck in helmets and armor,
with swords on their backs, but they took the ferry out into the
river well enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is how we left home,&rdquo; Perrin said suddenly. &ldquo;At
Taren Ferry. The ferrymen&rsquo;s boots clunking on the deck, and the
water gurgling around the ferry. This is how we left. It will be
worse, this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can it be worse?&rdquo; Rand asked. Perrin did not
answer. He searched the far bank, and his golden eyes almost seemed
to shine, but not with eagerness.</p>

<p>After a minute, Mat asked, &ldquo;How can it be worse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be. I can smell it,&rdquo; was all Perrin would
say. Hurin eyed him nervously, but then Hurin seemed to be eyeing
everything nervously since they had left Fal Dara.</p>

<p>The ferry bumped against the south bank with a hollow
thud of stout planks against hard clay, almost under overhanging
trees, and the Shienarans who had been hauling on the rope mounted
their horses, except for two Ingtar told to take the ferry back
over for the others. The rest followed Ingtar up the bank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fifty paces to a big stoneoak,&rdquo; Ingtar said as they
rode into the trees. He sounded too matter-of-fact. If Ragan could
not speak of it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Some of the soldiers eased the swords on
their backs, and held their lances ready.</p>

<p>At first Rand thought the figures hanging by their
arms from the thick gray limbs of the stoneoak were scarecrows.
Crimson scarecrows. Then he recognized the two faces. Changu, and
the other man who had been on guard with him. Nidao. Eyes staring,
teeth bared in a rictus of pain. They had lived a long time after
it began.</p>

<p>Perrin made a sound in his throat, nearly a
growl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As bad as ever I&rsquo;ve seen, my Lord,&rdquo; Hurin said
faintly. &ldquo;As bad as ever I&rsquo;ve smelled, excepting the dungeon at Fal
Dara that night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frantically Rand sought the void. The flame seemed to
get in the way, the queasy light fluttering in time with his
convulsive swallows, but he pushed on until he had wrapped himself
in emptiness. The queasiness pulsed in the void with him, though.
Not outside, for once, but inside. <em>No wonder, looking at
this</em>. The thought skittered across the void like a drop of
water on a hot griddle. <em>What happened to them?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Skinned alive,&rdquo; he heard someone behind him say, and
the sounds of somebody else retching. He thought it was Mat, but it
was all far away from him, inside the void. But that nauseous
flickering was in there, too. He thought he might throw up
himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cut them down,&rdquo; Ingtar said harshly. He hesitated a
moment, then added, &ldquo;Bury them. We cannot be sure they were
Darkfriends. They could have been taken prisoner. They could have
been. Let them know the last embrace of the mother, at least.&rdquo; Men
rode forward gingerly with knives; even for battle-hardened
Shienarans it was no easy task, cutting down the flayed corpses of
men they knew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you all right, Rand?&rdquo; Ingtar said. &ldquo;I am not
used to this either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;am all right, Ingtar.&rdquo; Rand let the void
vanish. He felt less sick without it; his stomach still curdled,
but it was better. Ingtar nodded and turned his horse so he could
watch the men working.</p>

<p>The burial was simple. Two holes dug in the ground,
and the bodies laid in as the rest of the Shienarans watched in
silence. The grave diggers began shoveling earth into the graves
with no more ado.</p>

<p>Rand was shocked, but Loial explained softly.
&ldquo;Shienarans believe we all came from earth, and must return to
earth. They never use coffins or shrouds, and the bodies are never
clothed. The earth must hold the body. The last embrace of the
mother, they call it. And there are never any words except &lsquo;The
Light shine on you, and the Creator shelter you. The last embrace
of the mother welcome you home.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; Loial sighed and shook his huge
head. &ldquo;I do not think anyone will say them this time. No matter
what Ingtar says, Rand, there cannot be much doubt that Changu and
Nidao slew the guards at the Dog Gate and let the Darkfriends into
the keep. It had to be they who were responsible for all of
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then who shot the arrow at&mdash;at the Amyrlin?&rdquo;
Rand swallowed. <em>Who shot at me?</em> Loial said nothing.</p>

<p>Uno arrived with the rest of the men and the
packhorses as the last earth was being shoveled onto the graves.
Someone told him what they had found, and the one-eyed man spat.
&ldquo;Goat-kissing Trollocs do that along the Blight, sometimes. When
they want to shake your bloody nerve, or flaming warn you not to
follow. Burn me if it works here, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before they rode away, Ingtar paused on his horse
beside the unmarked graves, two mounds of bare earth that looked
too small to hold men. After a moment he said, &ldquo;The Light shine on
you, and the Creator shelter you. The last embrace of the mother
welcome you home.&rdquo; When he raised his head, he looked at each man
in turn. There was no expression on any face, least of all on
Ingtar&rsquo;s. &ldquo;They saved Lord Agelmar at Tarwin&rsquo;s Gap,&rdquo; he said.
Several of the lancers nodded. Ingtar turned his horse. &ldquo;Which way,
Hurin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;South, my Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take the trail! We hunt!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The forest soon gave way to gently rolling flatland,
sometimes crossed by a shallow stream that had dug itself a
high-banked channel, with never more than a low rise or a squat
hill that barely deserved the name. Perfect country for the horses.
Ingtar took advantage of it, setting a steady, ground-covering
pace. Occasionally Rand saw what might have been a farmhouse in the
distance, and once what he thought was a village, with smoke rising
from chimneys a few miles off and something flashing white in the
sun, but the land near them stayed empty of human life, long
swathes of grass dotted with brush and occasional trees, with now
and again a small thicket, never more than a hundred paces
across.</p>

<p>Ingtar put out scouts, two men riding ahead, in sight
only when they topped an occasional rise. He had a silver whistle
hanging around his neck to call them back if Hurin said the trail
had veered, but it did not. South. Always south.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will reach the field of Talidar in three or four
days at this rate,&rdquo; Ingtar said as they rode. &ldquo;Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s
greatest single victory, when the Halfmen led the Trollocs out of
the Blight against him. Six days and nights, it lasted, and when it
was done, the Trollocs fled back into the Blight and never dared
challenge him again. He raised a monument there to his victory, a
spire a hundred spans high. He would not let them put his own name
on it, but rather the names of every man who fell, and a golden sun
at the top, symbol that there the Light had triumphed over the
Shadow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like to see that,&rdquo; Loial said. &ldquo;I have never
heard of this monument.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ingtar was silent for a moment, and when he spoke his
voice was quiet. &ldquo;It is not there any longer, Builder. When
Hawkwing died, the ones who fought over his empire could not bear
to leave a monument to a victory of his, even if it did not mention
his name. There&rsquo;s nothing left but the mound where it stood. In
three or four days we can see that, at least.&rdquo; His tone did not
allow much conversation afterwards.</p>

<p>With the sun hanging golden overhead, they passed a
structure, square and made of plastered brick, less than a mile
from their path. It was not tall, no more than two stories still
standing anywhere he saw, but it covered a good hide of ground. An
air of long abandonment hung about it, roofs gone except for a few
stretches of dark tile clinging to bits of rafter, most of the
once-white plaster fallen to bare the dark, weathered brick
beneath, walls fallen to show courtyards and decaying chambers
inside. Brush, and even trees, grew in the cracks of what had once
been courtyards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A manor house,&rdquo; Ingtar explained. The little humor
he had regained seemed to fade as he looked at the structure. &ldquo;When
Harad Dakar still stood, I expect the manorman farmed this land for
a league around. Orchards, maybe. The Hardani loved their
orchards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harad Dakar?&rdquo; Rand said, and Ingtar snorted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does no one learn history any longer? Harad Dakar,
the capital city of Hardan, which nation this once was that we are
riding across.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen an old map,&rdquo; Rand replied in a tight
voice. &ldquo;I know about the nations that aren&rsquo;t there anymore. Maredo,
and Goaban, and Carralain. But there wasn&rsquo;t any Hardan on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There were once others that are gone now, too,&rdquo;
Loial said. &ldquo;Mar Haddon, which is now Haddon Mirk, and Almoth.
Kintara. The War of the Hundred Years cut Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s empire
into many nations, large and small. The small were gobbled up by
the large, or else united, like Altara and Murandy. Forced together
would be a better word than united, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So what happened to them?&rdquo; Mat demanded. Rand had
not noticed Perrin and Mat ride up to join them. They had been at
the rear, as far from Rand al&rsquo;Thor as they could get, the last he
had seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They could not hold together,&rdquo; the Ogier replied.
&ldquo;Crops failed, or trade failed. People failed. Something failed in
each case, and the nation dwindled. Often neighboring countries
absorbed the land, when the nations were gone, but they never
lasted, those annexations. In time, the land truly was abandoned.
Some villages hang on here and there, but mostly they have all gone
to wilderness. It is nearly three hundred years since Harad Dakar
was finally abandoned, but even before that it was a shell, with a
king who could not control what happened inside the city walls.
Harad Dakar itself is completely gone now, I understand. All the
towns and cities of Hardan are gone, the stone carted away by
farmers and villagers for their own use. Most of the farms and
villages made with it are gone, too. So I read, and I&rsquo;ve seen
nothing to change it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was quite a quarry, Harad Dakar, for almost a
hundred years,&rdquo; Ingtar said bitterly. &ldquo;The people left, finally,
and then the city was hauled away, stone by stone. All faded away,
and what has not gone is fading. Everything, everywhere, fading.
There is hardly a nation that truly controls the land it claims on
a map, and there is hardly a land that claims today on a map what
it did even a hundred years ago. When the War of the Hundred Years
ended, a man rode from one nation into another without end from the
Blight to the Sea of Storms. Now we can ride through wilderness
claimed by no nation for almost the whole of the land. We in the
Borderlands have our battle with the Blight to keep us strong, and
whole. Perhaps they did not have what they needed to keep them
strong. You say they failed, Builder? Yes, they failed, and what
nation standing whole today will fail tomorrow? We are being swept
away, humankind. Swept away like flotsam on a flood. How long until
there is nothing left but the Borderlands? How long before we, too,
go under, and there is nothing left but Trollocs and Myrddraal all
the way to the Sea of Storms?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a shocked silence. Not even Mat broke it.
Ingtar rode lost in his own dark thoughts.</p>

<p>After a time the scouts came galloping back, straight
in the saddles, lances erect against the sky. &ldquo;A village ahead, my
Lord. We were not seen, but it lies directly in our line of
march.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ingtar shook himself out of his brown study, but did
not speak until they had reached the crest of a low ridge looking
down on the village, and then it was only to command a halt while
he dug a looking glass from his saddlebags and raised it to peer at
the village.</p>

<p>Rand studied the village with interest. It was as big
as Emond&rsquo;s Field, though that was not very big compared to some of
the towns he had seen since leaving the Two Rivers, much less the
cities. The houses were all low and plastered with white clay, and
they appeared to have grass growing on sloping roofs. A dozen
windmills, scattered through the village, turned lazily, their
long, cloth-covered arms flashing white in the sun. A low wall
encircled the village, grassy dirt and chest high, and outside that
was a wide ditch with sharpened stakes thick in the bottom. There
was no gate in the one opening he could see in the wall, but he
supposed it could be blocked easily enough with a cart or wagon. He
could not see any people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not even a dog in sight,&rdquo; Ingtar said, returning the
looking glass to his saddlebags. &ldquo;Are you sure they did not see
you?&rdquo; he asked the scouts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not unless they have the Dark One&rsquo;s own luck, my
Lord,&rdquo; one of the men replied. &ldquo;We never crested the rise. We
didn&rsquo;t see anyone moving then either, my Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ingtar nodded. &ldquo;The trail, Hurin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hurin drew a deep breath. &ldquo;Toward the village, my
Lord. Straight to it, as near as I can tell from here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch sharp,&rdquo; Ingtar commanded, gathering his reins.
&ldquo;And do not believe that they&rsquo;re friendly just because they smile.
If there is anyone there.&rdquo; He led them down toward the village at a
slow walk, and reached up to loosen his sword in its scabbard.</p>

<p>Rand heard the sounds of others behind him doing the
same. After a moment, he eased his, too. Trying to stay alive was
not the same as trying to be a hero, he decided.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think these people would help Darkfriends?&rdquo;
Perrin asked Ingtar. The Shienaran was slow in answering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have no great love for Shienarans,&rdquo; he said
finally. &ldquo;They think we should protect them. Us, or the Cairhienin.
Cairhien did claim this land, once the last King of Hardan died.
All the way to the Erinin, they claimed it. They could not hold it,
though. They gave up the claim nearly a hundred years ago. The few
people who still live here don&rsquo;t have to worry about Trollocs this
far south, but there are plenty of human brigands. That&rsquo;s why they
have the wall, and the ditch. All their villages do. Their fields
will be hidden in hollows around here, but no one will live outside
the wall. They would swear fealty to any king who would give them
his protection, but we have all we can do against the Trollocs.
They do not love us for it, though.&rdquo; As they reached the opening in
the low wall, he added again, &ldquo;Watch sharp!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All the streets led toward a village square, but
there was no one in the streets, no one peering from a window. Not
even a dog moved, not so much as a chicken. Nothing living. Open
doors swung, creaking in the wind, counterpoint to the rhythmic
squeak of the windmills. The horses&rsquo; hooves sounded loud on the
packed dirt of the street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like at the ferry,&rdquo; Hurin muttered, &ldquo;but different.&rdquo;
He rode hunched in his saddle, head down as if he were trying to
hide behind his own shoulders. &ldquo;Violence done, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t
know. It was bad here. It smells bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uno,&rdquo; Ingtar said, &ldquo;take one file and search the
houses. If you find anyone, bring them to me in the square. Do not
frighten them this time, though. I want answers, not people running
for their lives.&rdquo; He led the other soldiers toward the center of
the village as Uno got his ten dismounted.</p>

<p>Rand hesitated, looking around. The creaking doors,
the squealing windmills, the horses&rsquo; hooves, all made too much
noise, as if there were not another sound in the world. He scanned
the houses. The curtains in an open window beat against the outside
of the house. They all seemed lifeless. With a sigh he got down and
walked to the nearest house, then stopped, staring at the door.</p>

<p><em>It&rsquo;s just a door. What are you afraid of?</em> He
wished he did not feel as if there was something waiting on the
other side. He pushed it open.</p>

<p>Inside was a tidy room. Or had been. The table was
set for a meal, ladder-back chairs gathered around, some plates
already served. A few flies buzzed above bowls of turnips and peas,
and more crawled on a cold roast sitting in its own congealed
grease. There was a slice half carved from the roast, the fork
still standing stuck in the meat and the carving knife lying
partway in the platter as if dropped. Rand stepped inside.</p>

<p>Blink.</p>

<p>A smiling, bald-headed man in rough clothes laid a
slice of meat on a plate held by a woman with a worn face. She was
smiling, too, though. She added peas and turnips to the plate and
passed it to one of the children lining the table. There were half
a dozen children, boys and girls, from nearly grown down to barely
tall enough to look over the table. The woman said something, and
the girl taking the plate from her laughed. The man started to cut
another slice.</p>

<p>Suddenly another girl screamed, pointing at the door
to the street. The man dropped the carving knife and whirled, then
he screamed, too, face tight with horror, and snatched up a child.
The woman grabbed another, and motioned desperately to the others,
her mouth working frantically, silently. They all scrabbled toward
a door in the back of the room.</p>

<p>That door burst open, and&mdash;</p>

<p>Blink.</p>

<p>Rand could not move. The flies buzzing over the table
sounded louder. His breath made a cloud in front of his mouth.</p>

<p>Blink.</p>

<p>Rand struggled, but his muscles seemed frozen. The
room was colder; he wanted to shiver, but he could not move even
that much. Flies crawled all over the table. He groped for the
void. The sour light was there, but he did not care. He had
to&mdash;</p>

<p>Blink.</p>

<p>That door burst open, and&mdash;</p>

<p>Blink.</p>

<p>The room was freezing. <em>So cold</em>. Flies
blackened the table; the walls were a shifting mass of flies, the
floor, the ceiling, all black with them. They crawled on Rand,
covering him, crawled over his face, his eyes, into his nose, his
mouth. <em>Light, help me. Cold</em>. The flies buzzed like
thunder. <em>Cold</em>. It penetrated the void, mocking the
emptiness, encasing him in ice. Desperately he reached for the
flickering light. His stomach twisted, but the light was warm.
Warm. Hot. He was hot.</p>

<p>Suddenly he was tearing at&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;something. He did
not know what, or how. Cobwebs made of steel. Moonbeams carved from
stone. They crumbled at his touch, but he knew he had not touched
anything. They shriveled and melted with the heat that surged
through him, heat like a forge fire, heat like the world burning,
heat like&mdash;</p>

<p>It was gone. Panting, he looked around with wide
eyes. A few flies lay on the half-carved roast, in the platter.
Dead flies. <em>Six flies. Only six</em>. There were more in the
bowls, half a dozen tiny black specks among the cold vegetables.
All dead. He staggered out into the street.</p>

<p>Mat was just coming out of a house across the street,
shaking his head. &ldquo;Nobody there,&rdquo; he told Perrin, still on his
horse. &ldquo;It looks like they just got up in the middle of supper and
walked away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A shout came from the square.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve found something,&rdquo; Perrin said, digging his
heels into his horse&rsquo;s flanks. Mat scrambled into his saddle and
galloped after him.</p>

<p>Rand. mounted Red more slowly; the stallion shied as
if feeling his unease. He glanced at the houses as he rode slowly
toward the square, but he could not make himself look at them for
long. <em>Mat went in one, and nothing happened to him</em>. He
resolved not to set foot inside another house in that village no
matter what. Booting Red, he quickened his pace.</p>

<p>Everyone was standing like statues in front of a
large building with wide double doors. Rand did not think it could
be an inn; there was no sign, for one thing. Perhaps a village
meeting place. He joined the silent circle, and stared along with
the rest.</p>

<p>There was a man spread-eagled across the doors with
thick spikes through wrists and shoulders. More spikes had been
driven into his eyes to hold his head up. Dark, dried blood made
fans down his cheeks. Scuff marks on the wood behind his boots
showed that he had been alive when it was done. When it began,
anyway.</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s breath caught. Not a man. Those black clothes,
blacker than black, had never been worn by any human. The wind
flapped an end of the cloak caught behind the body&mdash;which it
did not always, he knew too well; the wind did not always touch
those clothes&mdash;but there had never been any eyes in that
pale, bloodless face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Myrddraal,&rdquo; he breathed, and it was as if
his speaking released all the others. They began to move again, and
breathe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who,&rdquo; Mat began, and had to stop to swallow. &ldquo;Who
could do this to a Fade?&rdquo; His voice squeaked at the end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Ingtar said. &ldquo;I do not
know.&rdquo; He looked around, examining faces, or perhaps counting
to be sure everyone was there. &ldquo;And I do not think we will learn
anything here. We ride. Mount! Hurin, find the trail out of this
place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my Lord. Yes. With pleasure. That way, my Lord.
They&rsquo;re still heading south.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They rode away leaving the dead Myrddraal where it
hung, the wind stirring its black cloak. Hurin was first beyond the
wall, not waiting on Ingtar for a change, but Rand came close
behind him.</p>
