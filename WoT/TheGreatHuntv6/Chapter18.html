<h4><em>To the White Tower</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">E</span>gwene
balanced on the heeling deck as the <em>River
Queen</em> sped down the wide Erinin under cloud-dark skies, sails
full-bellied, White Flame banner whipping furiously at the
mainmast. The wind had risen as soon as the last of them was aboard
the ships, back in Medo, and it had not failed or flagged for an
instant since, day or night. The river had begun to race in flood,
as it still did, slapping the ships about while it drove them
onward. Wind and river had not slowed, and neither had the ships,
all clustered together. The <em>River Queen</em> led, only right
for the vessel that carried the Amyrlin Seat.</p>

<p>The helmsman held his tiller grimly, feet planted and
spread, and sailors padded barefoot at their work, intent on what
they did; when they glanced at the sky or the river, they tore
their eyes away with low mutters. A village was just fading from
view behind, and a boy raced along the bank; he had kept up with
the ships for a short distance, but now they were leaving him
behind. When he vanished, Egwene made her way below.</p>

<p>In the small cabin they shared, Nynaeve glared up at
her from her narrow bed. &ldquo;They say we&rsquo;ll reach Tar Valon today. The
Light help me, but I&rsquo;ll be glad to put foot on land again even if
it is in Tar Valon.&rdquo; The ship lurched with wind and current, and
Nynaeve swallowed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never step on a boat again,&rdquo; she said
breathlessly.</p>

<p>Egwene shook the river spray out of her cloak and
hung it on a peg by the door. It was not a big cabin&mdash;there
were no big cabins on the ship, it seemed, not even the one the
Amyrlin had taken over from the captain, though that was larger
than the rest. With its two beds built into the walls, shelves
beneath them and cabinets above, everything lay close to hand.</p>

<p>Except for keeping her balance, the movements of the
ship did not bother her the way they did Nynaeve; she had given up
offering Nynaeve food after the third time the Wisdom threw the
bowl at her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m worried about Rand,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m worried about all of them,&rdquo; Nynaeve replied
dully. After a moment, she said, &ldquo;Another dream last night? The way
you&rsquo;ve been staring at nothing since you got up&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene nodded. She had never been very good at
keeping things from Nynaeve, and she had not tried with the dreams.
Nynaeve had tried to dose her at first, until she heard one of the
Aes Sedai was interested; then she began to believe. &ldquo;It was like
the others. Different, but the same. Rand is in some kind of
danger. I know it. And it is getting worse. He&rsquo;s done something, or
he&rsquo;s going to do something, that puts him in&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She dropped
down on her bed and leaned toward the other woman. &ldquo;I just wish I
could make some sense of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Channeling?&rdquo; Nynaeve said softly.</p>

<p>Despite herself, Egwene looked around to see if
anyone was there to hear. They were alone, with the door closed,
but still she spoke just as softly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe.&rdquo; There
was no telling what Aes Sedai could do&mdash;she had seen enough
already to make her believe every story of their powers&mdash;and
she would not risk eavesdropping. <em>I won&rsquo;t risk Rand. If I did
right, I&rsquo;d tell them, but Moiraine knows, and she hasn&rsquo;t said
anything. And it&rsquo;s Rand! I can&rsquo;t</em>. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has Anaiya said anything more about these dreams?&rdquo;
Nynaeve seemed to make it a point never to add the honorific Sedai,
even when the two of them were alone. Most of the Aes Sedai
appeared not to care, but the habit had earned a few strange looks,
and some hard ones; she was going to train in the White Tower,
after all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; Egwene
quoted Anaiya. &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;The boy is far away, child, and there&rsquo;s nothing we
can do until we know more. I will see to testing you myself once we
reach the White Tower, child.&rsquo; Aaagh! She <em>knows</em> there is
something in these dreams. I can tell she does. I like the woman,
Nynaeve; I do. But she won&rsquo;t <em>tell</em> me what I want to know.
And I can&rsquo;t tell her everything. Maybe if I could&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man in the mask again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene nodded. Somehow, she was sure it was better
not to tell Anaiya about him. She could not imagine why, but she
was sure. Three times the man whose eyes were fire had been in her
dreams, each time when she dreamed a dream that convinced her Rand
was in danger. He always wore a mask across his face; sometimes she
could see his eyes, and sometimes she could only see fire where
they should be. &ldquo;He laughed at me. It was so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;contemptuous. As
though I were a puppy he was going to have to push out of his way
with his foot. It frightens me. <em>He</em> frightens me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure it has anything to do with the other
dreams, with Rand? Sometimes a dream is just a dream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene threw up her hands. &ldquo;And sometimes, Nynaeve,
you sound just like Anaiya Sedai!&rdquo; She put a special emphasis on
the title, and was pleased to see Nynaeve grimace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I ever get out of this bed, Egwene&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A knock at the door cut off whatever Nynaeve had been
going to say. Before Egwene could speak or move, the Amyrlin
herself came in and shut the door behind her. She was alone, for a
wonder; she seldom left her cabin, and then always with Leane at
her side, and maybe another of the Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>Egwene sprang to her feet. The room was a little
crowded, with three of them in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Both of you feeling well?&rdquo; the Amyrlin said
cheerily. She tilted her head at Nynaeve. &ldquo;Eating well, too, I
trust? In good temper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve struggled to a sitting position, with her
back against the wall. &ldquo;My temper is just fine, thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are honored, Mother,&rdquo; Egwene began, but the
Amyrlin waved her to silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to be on the water again, but it grows
boring as a mill pond after a while with nothing to do.&rdquo; The ship
heeled, and she shifted her balance without seeming to notice. &ldquo;I
will give you your lesson today.&rdquo; She folded herself onto the end
of Egwene&rsquo;s bed, feet tucked under her. &ldquo;Sit, child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene sat, but Nynaeve began trying to push herself
to her feet. &ldquo;I think I will go on deck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said, sit!&rdquo; The Amyrlin&rsquo;s voice cracked like a
whip, but Nynaeve kept rising, wavering. She still had both hands
on the bed, but she was almost upright. Egwene held herself ready
to catch her when she fell.</p>

<p>Closing her eyes, Nynaeve slowly lowered herself back
to the bed. &ldquo;Perhaps I will stay. It is no doubt windy up
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin barked a laugh. &ldquo;They told me you had a
temper in you like a fisher-bird with a bone in its throat. Some of
them, child, say you&rsquo;d do well for some time as a novice, no matter
how old you are. I say, if you have the ability I hear of, you
deserve to be one of the Accepted.&rdquo; She gave another laugh. &ldquo;I
always believe in giving people what they deserve. Yes. I suspect
you will learn a great deal once you reach the White Tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather one of the Warders taught me how to use a
sword,&rdquo; Nynaeve growled. She swallowed convulsively, and opened her
eyes. &ldquo;There is someone I&rsquo;d like to use it on.&rdquo; Egwene looked at
her sharply; did Nynaeve mean the Amyrlin&mdash;which was stupid,
and dangerous besides&mdash;or Lan? She snapped at Egwene every
time Lan was mentioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A sword?&rdquo; the Amyrlin said. &ldquo;I never thought swords
were much use&mdash;even if you have the skill, child, there are
always men who have as much, and a deal more strength&mdash;but if
you want a sword&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She held up her hand&mdash;Egwene gasped,
and even Nynaeve&rsquo;s eyes bulged&mdash;and there was a sword in it.
With blade and hilt of an odd bluish white, it looked somehow&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;cold. &ldquo;Made from the air, child, with Air. It&rsquo;s as good as most
steel blades, better than most, but still not much use.&rdquo; The sword
became a paring knife. There was no shrinking; it just was one
thing, then the other. &ldquo;This, now, is useful.&rdquo; The paring knife
turned to mist, and the mist faded away. The Amyrlin put her empty
hand back in her lap. &ldquo;But either takes more effort than it is
worth. Better, easier, simply to carry a good knife with you. You
have to learn when to use your ability, as well as how, and when
it&rsquo;s better to do things the way any other woman would. Let a
blacksmith make knives for gutting fish. Use the One Power too
often and too freely, and you can come to like it too much. That
way lies danger. You begin to want more of it, and sooner or later
you run the risk of drawing more than you&rsquo;ve learned to handle. And
that can burn you out like a guttered candle, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I must learn all this,&rdquo; Nynaeve broke in stiffly,
&ldquo;I would as soon learn something useful. All this&mdash;this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&lsquo;Make the air stir, Nynaeve. Light the candle, Nynaeve. Now put it
out. Light it again.&rsquo; Paah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene closed her eyes for a moment. <em>Please,
Nynaeve. Please keep a check on your temper</em>. She bit her lip
to keep from saying it out loud.</p>

<p>The Amyrlin was silent for a moment. &ldquo;Useful,&rdquo; she
said at last. &ldquo;Something useful. You wanted a sword. Suppose a man
came at me with a sword. What would I do? Something useful, you can
be sure. This, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For an instant, Egwene thought she saw a glow around
the woman at the other end of her bed. Then the air seemed to
thicken; nothing changed that Egwene could see, but she could
surely feel it. She tried to lift her arm; it did not budge any
more than if she were buried to her neck in thick jelly. Nothing
could move except her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Release me!&rdquo; Nynaeve grated. Her eyes glared, and
her head jerked from side to side, but the rest of her sat as
rigidly as a statue. Egwene realized that she was not the only one
held. &ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Useful, wouldn&rsquo;t you say? And it is nothing but
Air.&rdquo; The Amyrlin spoke in a conversational tone, as if they were
all chatting over tea. &ldquo;Big man, with his muscles and his sword,
and the sword does him as much good as the hair on his chest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me go, I say!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if I don&rsquo;t like where he is, why, I can pick him
up.&rdquo; Nynaeve squawked furiously as she slowly rose, still in a
sitting position, until her head almost touched the ceiling. The
Amyrlin smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often wished I could use this to fly. The
records say Aes Sedai <em>could</em> fly, in the Age of Legends,
but they aren&rsquo;t clear on how, exactly. Not this way, though. It
doesn&rsquo;t work like that. You might reach out with your hands and
pick up a chest that weighs as much as you do; you look strong. But
take hold of yourself however you will, you cannot pick yourself
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s head jerked furiously, but not another
muscle of her twitched. &ldquo;The Light burn you, let me
go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene swallowed hard and hoped she was not also to
be lifted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; the Amyrlin continued, &ldquo;big, hairy man, and so
forth. He can do nothing to me, while I can do anything at all to
him. Why, if I had a mind to&rdquo;&mdash;she leaned forward, her eyes
intent on Nynaeve; suddenly her smile did not seem very friendly&mdash;&ldquo;I could turn him upside down and paddle his bottom. Just
like&mdash;&rdquo; Suddenly the Amyrlin flew backwards so hard her head
rebounded from the wall, and there she stayed, as if something were
pressing against her.</p>

<p>Egwene stared, her mouth dry. <em>This isn&rsquo;t
happening. It isn&rsquo;t</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were right,&rdquo; the Amyrlin said. Her voice
sounded strained, as though she found it hard to breathe. &ldquo;They
said you learned quickly. And they said it took your temper burning
to get to the heart of what you can do.&rdquo; She took a struggling
breath. &ldquo;Shall we release each other together, child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve, floating in the air with her eyes ablaze,
said, &ldquo;You let me go right now, or I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo; Abruptly a look of
amazement came over her face, a look of loss. Her mouth worked
slently.</p>

<p>The Amyrlin sat up, working her shoulders. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
know everything yet, do you, child? Not the hundredth part of
everything. You did not suspect I could cut you off from the True
Source. You can still feel it there, but you can&rsquo;t touch it any
more than a fish can touch the moon. When you learn enough to be
raised to full sisterhood, no one woman will be able to do that to
you. The stronger you become, the more Aes Sedai it will take to
shield you against your will. Do you think, now, you want to
learn?&rdquo; Nynaeve pressed her mouth shut in a thin line and stared
her in the eye grimly. The Amyrlin sighed. &ldquo;If you had a hair less
potential than you do, child, I would send you to the Mistress of
Novices and tell her to keep you the rest of your life. But you
will get what you deserve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s eyes widened, and she had just time to
start a yell before she dropped, hitting her bed with a loud thud.
Egwene winced; the mattresses were thin, and the wood beneath hard.
Nynaeve&rsquo;s face stayed frozen as she shifted the way she sat, just a
fraction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; the Amyrlin said firmly, &ldquo;unless you would
like further demonstration, we will get on with your lesson.
Continue your lesson, we might say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother?&rdquo; Egwene said faintly. She still could not
twitch below her chin.</p>

<p>The Amyrlin looked at her questioningly, then smiled.
&ldquo;Oh. I am sorry, child. Your friend was occupying my attention, I&rsquo;m
afraid.&rdquo; Suddenly Egwene could move again; she raised her arms,
just to convince herself that she could. &ldquo;Are you both ready to
learn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mother,&rdquo; Egwene said quickly.</p>

<p>The Amyrlin raised an eyebrow at Nynaeve.</p>

<p>After a moment, Nynaeve said in a tight voice, &ldquo;Yes,
Mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good. Now, then. Empty your thoughts of everything
but a flower bud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene was sweating by the time the Amyrlin left. She
had thought some of the other Aes Sedai had been hard teachers, but
that smiling, plain-faced woman coaxed out every last drop of
effort, drew it out, and when there was nothing left, she seemed to
reach into you and pulled it out. It had gone well, though. As the
door closed behind the Amyrlin, Egwene raised one hand; a tiny
flame sprang to life, balanced a hairbreadth above the tip of her
forefinger, then danced from fingertip to fingertip. She was not
supposed to do this without a teacher&mdash;one of the Accepted,
at the very least&mdash;to watch over her, but she was too excited
at her progress to pay any mind to that.</p>

<p>Nynaeve bounded to her feet and threw her pillow at
the closing door. &ldquo;That&mdash;that vile, contemptible, miserable&mdash;hag! The Light burn her! I&rsquo;d like to feed her to the fish.
I&rsquo;d like to dose her with things that would turn her green for the
rest of her life! I don&rsquo;t care if she&rsquo;s old enough to be my mother,
if I had her in Emond&rsquo;s Field, she wouldn&rsquo;t sit down comfortably
for&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Her teeth ground so loudly that Egwene jumped.</p>

<p>Letting the flame die, Egwene put her eyes firmly on
her lap. She wished she could think of a way to sneak out of the
room without catching Nynaeve&rsquo;s eye.</p>

<p>The lesson had not gone well for Nynaeve, because she
had held her temper on a tight lead until the Amyrlin was gone. She
never could do very much unless she was angry, and then it all
burst out of her. After failure upon failure, the Amyrlin had done
everything she could to rouse her again. Egwene wished Nynaeve
could forget she had been there to see or hear any of it.</p>

<p>Nynaeve stalked stiffly to her bed and stood staring
at the wall behind it, her fist clenched at her side. Egwene looked
longingly at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not your fault,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, and Egwene
gave a start.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve turned to look down at her. &ldquo;It was not your
fault,&rdquo; she repeated, sounding unconvinced. &ldquo;But if you ever
breathe one word, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a word,&rdquo; Egwene said quickly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even
remember anything to breathe a word about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve stared at her a moment longer, then nodded.
Abruptly she grimaced. &ldquo;Light, I did not think <em>anything</em>
tasted worse than raw sheepstongue root. I&rsquo;ll remember that, the
next time you act the goose, so watch yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene winced. That had been the first thing the
Amyrlin had done trying to rouse Nynaeve&rsquo;s anger. A dark glob of
something that glistened like grease and smelled vile had suddenly
appeared and, while the Amyrlin held Nynaeve with the Power, had
been forced into the Wisdom&rsquo;s mouth. The Amyrlin had even held her
nose to make her swallow. And Nynaeve remembered things, if she had
seen them done once. Egwene did not think there was any way of
stopping her if she took it into her mind to do it; for all her own
success in making a flame dance, <em>she</em> could never have held
the Amyrlin against a wall. &ldquo;At least being on the ship isn&rsquo;t
making you sick anymore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve grunted, then gave a short, sharp laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
too angry to be sick.&rdquo; With another mirthless laugh, she shook her
head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too miserable to be sick. Light, I feel as if I&rsquo;ve been
dragged through a knothole backwards. If that is what novice
training is like, you will have incentive to learn quickly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene scowled at her knees. Compared to Nynaeve, the
Amyrlin had only coaxed her, smiled at her successes, sympathized
with her failures, then coaxed again. But all the Aes Sedai had
said things would be different in the White Tower; harder, though
they would not say how. If she had to go through what Nynaeve had,
day after day, she did not think she could stand it.</p>

<p>Something changed in the motion of the ship. The
rocking eased, and feet thumped on the deck above their heads. A
man shouted something Egwene could not quite make out.</p>

<p>She looked up at Nynaeve. &ldquo;Do you think&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Tar
Valon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is only one way to find out,&rdquo; Nynaeve replied,
and determinedly took her cloak from its peg.</p>

<p>When they reached the deck, sailors were running
everywhere, heaving at lines, shortening sail, readying long
sweeps. The wind had died to a breeze, and the clouds were
scattering, now.</p>

<p>Egwene rushed to the rail. &ldquo;It is! It is Tar Valon!&rdquo;
Nynaeve joined her with an expressionless face.</p>

<p>The island was so big it looked more as if the river
split in two than contained a bit of land. Bridges that seemed to
be made of lace arched from either bank to the island, crossing
marshy ground as well as the river. The walls of the city, the
Shining Walls of Tar Valon, glistened white as the sun broke
through the clouds. And on the west bank, its broken top leaking a
thin wisp of smoke, Dragonmount reared black against the sky, one
mountain standing among flat lands and rolling hills. Dragonmount,
where the Dragon had died. Dragonmount, made by the Dragon&rsquo;s
dying.</p>

<p>Egwene wished she did not think of Rand when she
looked at the mountain. <em>A man channeling. Light, help
him.</em></p>

<p>The <em>River Queen</em> passed through a wide
opening in a tall, circular wall that thrust out into the river.
Inside, one long wharf surrounded a round harbor. Sailors furled
the last sails and used sweeps alone to move the ship stern-first
to its docking. Around the long wharf, the other ships that had
come downriver were now being snugged into their berths among the
ships already there. The White Flame banner set workers scurrying
along the already busy wharf.</p>

<p>The Amyrlin came on deck before the shore lines were
tied off, but dockworkers ran a gangplank aboard as soon as she
appeared. Leane walked at her side, flame-tipped staff in hand, and
the other Aes Sedai on the ship followed them ashore. None of them
so much as glanced at Egwene or Nynaeve. On the wharf a delegation
greeted the Amyrlin&mdash;shawled Aes Sedai, bowing formally, kissing the
Amyrlin&rsquo;s ring. The wharf bustled, between ships unloading and the
Amyrlin Seat arriving; soldiers formed up on disembarking, men set
booms for cargo; trumpet flourishes rang from the walls, competing
with cheers from the onlookers.</p>

<p>Nynaeve gave a loud sniff. &ldquo;It seems they&rsquo;ve
forgotten us. Come along. We&rsquo;ll see to ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene was reluctant to leave her first sight of Tar
Valon, but she followed Nynaeve below to gather their things. When
they came back topside, bundles in their arms, soldiers and
trumpets were gone&mdash;and Aes Sedai, too. Men were swinging
back hatches along the deck and lowering cables into the holds.</p>

<p>On the deck, Nynaeve caught a dockman&rsquo;s arm, a burly
fellow in a coarse brown shirt with no sleeves. &ldquo;Our horses,&rdquo; she
began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m busy,&rdquo; he growled, pulling free. &ldquo;Horses&rsquo;ll all
be took to the White Tower.&rdquo; He looked them up and down. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve
business with the Tower, best you take yourselves on. Aes Sedai
don&rsquo;t hold with newlings being tardy.&rdquo; Another man, wrestling with
a bale being swung out of the hold on a cable, shouted to him, and
he left the women without a backwards glance.</p>

<p>Egwene exchanged looks with Nynaeve. It seemed they
really were on their own.</p>

<p>Nynaeve stalked off the ship with grim determination
on her face, but Egwene made her way dejectedly down the gangplank
and through the tarry smell that hung over the wharf. <em>All that
talk about wanting us here, and now they don&rsquo;t seem to
care</em>.</p>

<p>Broad stairs led up from the dock to a wide arch of
dark redstone. On reaching it, Egwene and Nynaeve stopped to
stare.</p>

<p>Every building seemed a palace, though most of those
close to the arch seemed to contain inns or shops, from the signs
over the doors. Fanciful stonework was everywhere, and the lines of
one structure seemed designed to complement and set off the next,
leading the eye along as if everything were part of one vast
design. Some structures did not look like buildings at all, but
like gigantic waves breaking, or huge shells, or fanciful,
windsculpted cliffs. Right in front of the arch lay a broad square,
with a fountain and trees, and Egwene could see another square
further on. Above everything rose the towers, tall and graceful,
some with sweeping bridges between them, high in the sky. And over
all rose one tower, higher and wider than all the rest, as white as
the Shining Walls themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fair takes the breath at first sight,&rdquo; said a
woman&rsquo;s voice behind them. &ldquo;At tenth sight, for that. And at
hundredth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene turned. The woman was Aes Sedai; Egwene was
sure of it, though she wore no shawl. No one else had that ageless
look; and she held herself with an assurance, a confidence that
seemed to confirm it. A glance at her hand showed the golden ring,
the serpent biting its own tail. The Aes Sedai was a little plump,
with a warm smile, and one of the oddest-appearing women Egwene had
ever seen. Her plumpness could not hide high cheekbones, her eyes
had a tilt to them and were the clearest, palest green, and her
hair was almost the color of fire. Egwene barely stopped herself
from goggling at that hair, those slightly slanted eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ogier built, of course,&rdquo; the Aes Sedai went on, &ldquo;and
their best work ever, some say. One of the first cities built after
the Breaking. There weren&rsquo;t half a thousand people here altogether
then&mdash;no more than twenty sisters&mdash;but they built for
what would be needed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a lovely city,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. &ldquo;We are supposed
to go to the White Tower. We came here for training, but no one
seems to care if we go or stay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They care,&rdquo; the woman said, smiling. &ldquo;I came here to
meet you, but I was delayed speaking with the Amyrlin. I am
Sheriam, the Mistress of Novices.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not to be a novice,&rdquo; Nynaeve said in a firm
voice, but a little too quickly. &ldquo;The Amyrlin herself said I was to
be one of the Accepted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I was told.&rdquo; Sheriam sounded amused. &ldquo;I have
never heard of it being done so before, but they say you are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;exceptional. Remember, though, even one of the Accepted can be
called to my study. It requires more breaking of the rules than for
a novice, but it has been known to happen.&rdquo; She turned to Egwene as
if she had not seen Nynaeve frown. &ldquo;And you are our new novice. It
is always good to see a novice come. We have too few, these days.
You will make forty&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Only forty. And no more than eight or
nine of those will be raised to the Accepted. Though I don&rsquo;t think
you will have to worry about that too much, if you work hard and
apply yourself. The work is hard, and even for one with the
potential they tell me you have, it will not be made any easier. If
you cannot stick to it, no matter how hard it is, or if you will
break under the strain, better we find it out now, and let you go
on your way, than wait until you are a full sister and others are
depending on you. An Aes Sedai&rsquo;s life is not easy. Here, we will
prepare you for it, if you have in you what is required.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene swallowed. <em>Break under the strain?</em> &ldquo;I
will try, Sheriam Sedai,&rdquo; she said faintly. <em>And I will not
break</em>.</p>

<p>Nynaeve looked at her worriedly. &ldquo;Sheriam&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She
stopped and took a deep breath. &ldquo;Sheriam Sedai&rdquo;&mdash;she seemed
to force the honorific out&mdash;&ldquo;does it have to be so hard on
her? Flesh and blood can only take so much. I know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;something&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;of what novices must go through. Surely there&rsquo;s no need to
try to break her just to find out how strong she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean what the Amyrlin did to you today?&rdquo;
Nynaeve&rsquo;s back stiffened; Sheriam looked as though she were trying
to keep amusement from her face. &ldquo;I told you I spoke with the
Amyrlin. Rest your worries for your friend. Novice training is
hard, but not that hard. That is for the first few weeks of being
one of the Accepted.&rdquo; Nynaeve&rsquo;s mouth fell open; Egwene thought the
Wisdom&rsquo;s eyes were going to come right out of her head. &ldquo;To catch
the few who might have slipped through novice training when they
should not have. We cannot risk having one of our number&mdash;a
full Aes Sedai&mdash;who will break under the stress of the world
outside.&rdquo; The Aes Sedai gathered them both up, an arm around the
shoulders of each. Nynaeve hardly seemed to realize where she was
going. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; Sheriam said, &ldquo;I will see you settled in your rooms.
The White Tower awaits.&rdquo;</p>
