<h4><em>Summoned</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">A</span>lone
in her rooms in the women&rsquo;s apartments,
Moiraine adjusted the shawl, embroidered with curling ivy and
grapevines, on her shoulders and studied the effect in the tall
frame mirror standing in a corner. Her large, dark eyes could
appear as sharp as a hawk&rsquo;s when she was angry. They seemed to
pierce the silvered glass, now. It was only happenstance that she
had had the shawl in her saddlebags when she came to Fal Dara. With
the blazing white Flame of Tar Valon centered on the wearer&rsquo;s back
and long fringe colored to show her Ajah&mdash;Moiraine&rsquo;s was as
blue as a morning sky&mdash;the shawls were seldom worn outside
Tar Valon, and even there usually only inside the White Tower.
Little in Tar Valon besides a meeting of the Hall of the Tower
called for the formality of the shawls, and beyond the Shining
Walls a sight of the Flame would send too many people running, to
hide or perhaps to fetch the Children of the Light. A Whitecloak&rsquo;s
arrow was as fatal to an Aes Sedai as to anyone else, and the
Children were too wily to let an Aes Sedai see the bowman before
the arrow struck, while she still might do something about it.
Moiraine had certainly never expected to wear the shawl in Fal
Dara. But for an audience with the Amyrlin, there were proprieties
to observe.</p>

<p>She was slender and not at all tall, and
smooth-cheeked Aes Sedai agelessness often made her appear younger
than she was, but Moiraine had a commanding grace and calm presence
that could dominate any gathering. A manner ingrained growing up in
the Royal Palace of Cairhien had been heightened, not submerged, by
still more years as an Aes Sedai. She knew she might need every bit
of it today. Yet much of the calm was on the surface, today.
<em>There must be trouble, or she would not have come herself</em>,
she thought for at least the tenth time. But beyond that lay a
thousand questions more. <em>What trouble, and who did she choose
to accompany her? Why here? Why now? It cannot be allowed to go
wrong now</em>.</p>

<p>The Great Serpent ring on her right hand caught the
light dully as she touched the delicate golden chain fastened in
her dark hair, which hung in waves to her shoulders. A small, clear
blue stone dangled from the chain, in the middle of her forehead.
Many in the White Tower knew of the tricks she could do using that
stone as a focus. It was only a polished bit of blue crystal, just
something a young girl had used in her first learning, with no one
to guide her. That girl had remembered tales of <em>angreal</em>
and even more powerful <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>&mdash;those fabled
remnants of the Age of Legends that allowed Aes Sedai to channel
more of the One Power than any could safely handle unaided&mdash;remembered and thought some such focus was required to channel at
all. Her sisters in the White Tower knew a few of her tricks, and
suspected others, including some that did not exist, some that had
shocked her when she learned of them. The things she did with the
stone were simple and small, if occasionally useful; the kind a
child would imagine. But if the wrong women had accompanied
the Amyrlin, the crystal might put them off balance, because of the
tales.</p>

<p>A rapid, insistent knocking came at the chamber door.
No Shienaran would knock that way, not at anyone&rsquo;s door, but least
of all hers. She remained looking into the mirror until her eyes
stared back serenely, all thought hidden in their dark depths. She
checked the soft leather pouch hanging at her belt. <em>Whatever
troubles brought her out of Tar Valon, she will forget them when I
lay this trouble before her</em>. A second thumping, even more
vigorous than the first, sounded before she crossed the room and
opened the door with a calm smile for the two women who had come
for her.</p>

<p>She recognized them both. Dark-haired Anaiya in her
blue-fringed shawl, and fair-haired Liandrin in her red. Liandrin,
not only young-seeming but young and pretty, with a doll&rsquo;s face and
a small, petulant mouth, had her hand raised to pound again. Her
dark brows and darker eyes were a sharp contrast to the multitude
of pale honey braids brushing her shoulders, but the combination
was not uncommon in Tarabon. Both women were taller than Moiraine,
though Liandrin by less than a hand.</p>

<p>Anaiya&rsquo;s blunt face broke into a smile as soon as
Moiraine opened the door. That smile gave her the only beauty she
would ever have, but it was enough; almost everyone felt comforted,
safe and special, when Anaiya smiled at them. &ldquo;The Light shine on
you, Moiraine. It&rsquo;s good to see you again. Are you well? It has
been so long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My heart is lighter for your presence, Anaiya.&rdquo; That
was certainly true; it was good to know she had at least one friend
among the Aes Sedai who had come to Fal Dara. &ldquo;The Light illumine
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Liandrin&rsquo;s mouth tightened, and she gave her shawl a
twitch. &ldquo;The Amyrlin Seat, she requires your presence, Sister.&rdquo; Her
voice was petulant, too, and cold-edged. Not for Moiraine&rsquo;s sake,
or not solely; Liandrin always sounded dissatisfied with something.
Frowning, she tried to look over Moiraine&rsquo;s shoulder into the room.
&ldquo;This chamber, it is warded. We cannot enter. Why do you ward
against your sisters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Against all,&rdquo; Moiraine replied smoothly. &ldquo;Many of
the serving women are curious about Aes Sedai, and I do not want
them pawing through my rooms when I am not here. There was no need
to make a distinction until now.&rdquo; She pulled the door shut behind
her, leaving all three of them in the corridor. &ldquo;Shall we go? We
must not keep the Amyrlin waiting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She started down the hallway with Anaiya chatting at
her side. Liandrin stood for a moment staring at the door as if
wondering what Moiraine was hiding, then hurried to join the
others. She bracketed Moiraine, walking as stiffly as a guard.
Anaiya merely walked, keeping company. Their slippered footsteps
fell softly on thick-woven carpets with simple patterns.</p>

<p>Liveried women curtsied deeply as they passed, many
more deeply than they would have for the Lord of Fal Dara himself.
Aes Sedai, three together, and the Amyrlin Seat herself in the
keep; it was more honor than any woman of the keep had ever
expected in her lifetime. A few women of noble Houses were out in
the halls, and they curtsied, too, which they most certainly would
not have done for Lord Agelmar. Moiraine and Anaiya smiled and
bowed their heads to acknowledge each reverence, from servant or
noble equally. Liandrin ignored them all.</p>

<p>There were only women here, of course, no men. No
Shienaran male above the age of ten would enter the women&rsquo;s rooms
without permission or invitation, although a few small boys ran and
played in the halls here. They knelt on one knee, awkwardly, when
their sisters dropped deep curtsies. Now and then Anaiya smiled and
ruffled a small head as she passed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This time, Moiraine,&rdquo; Anaiya said, &ldquo;you have been
gone from Tar Valon too long. Much too long. Tar Valon misses you.
Your sisters miss you. And you are needed in the White Tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of us must work in the world,&rdquo; Moiraine said
gently. &ldquo;I will leave the Hall of the Tower to you, Anaiya. Yet in
Tar Valon, you hear more of what occurs in the world than I. Too
often I outrun what happens where I was yesterday. What news have
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three more false Dragons.&rdquo; Liandrin bit the words
off. &ldquo;In Saldaea, Murandy, and Tear false Dragons ravage the land.
The while, you Blues smile and talk of nothing, and try to hold on
to the past.&rdquo; Anaiya raised an eyebrow, and Liandrin snapped her
mouth shut with a sharp sniff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three,&rdquo; Moiraine mused softly. For an instant her
eyes gleamed, but she masked it quickly. &ldquo;Three in the last two
years, and now three more at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the others were, these will be dealt with also.
This male vermin and any ragtag rabble who follow their
banners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine was almost amused by the certainty in
Liandrin&rsquo;s voice. Almost. She was too aware of the realities, too
aware of the possibilities. &ldquo;Have a few months been enough for you
to forget, Sister? The last false Dragon all but tore Ghealdan
apart before his army, ragtag rabble or not, was defeated. Yes,
Logain is in Tar Valon by now, gentled and safe, I suppose, but
some of our sisters died to overpower him. Even one sister dead is
more loss than we can bear, but Ghealdan&rsquo;s losses were much worse.
The two before Logain could not channel, yet even so the people of
Kandor and Arad Doman remember them well. Villages burned and men
dead in battle. How easily can the world deal with three at one
time? How many will flock to their banners? There has never been a
shortage of followers for any man claiming to be the Dragon Reborn.
How great will the wars be this time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t so grim as that,&rdquo; Anaiya said. &ldquo;As far as
we know, only the one in Saldaea can channel. He has not had time
to attract many followers, and sisters should already be there to
deal with him. The Tarens are harrying their false Dragon and his
followers through Haddon Mirk, while the fellow in Murandy is
already in chains.&rdquo; She gave a short, wondering laugh. &ldquo;To think
the Murandians, of all people, would deal with theirs so quickly.
Ask, and they do not even call themselves Murandians, but
Lugarders, or Inishlinni, or this or that lord&rsquo;s or lady&rsquo;s man. Yet
for fear one of their neighbors would take the excuse to invade,
the Murandians leaped on their false Dragon almost as soon as he
opened his mouth to proclaim himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; Moiraine said, &ldquo;three at the same time
cannot be ignored. Has any sister been able to do a Foretelling?&rdquo;
It was a slight chance&mdash;few Aes Sedai had manifested any part
of that Talent, even the smallest part, in centuries&mdash;so she
was not surprised when Anaiya shook her head. Not surprised, but a
little relieved.</p>

<p>They reached a juncture of hallways at the same time
as the Lady Amalisa. She dropped a full curtsy, bowing deep and
spreading her pale green skirts wide. &ldquo;Honor to Tar Valon,&rdquo; she
murmured. &ldquo;Honor to Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sister of the Lord of Fal Dara required more than
a nod of the head. Moiraine took Amalisa&rsquo;s hands and drew her to
her feet. &ldquo;You honor us, Amalisa. Rise, Sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amalisa straightened gracefully, with a flush on her
face. She had never as much as been to Tar Valon, and to be called
Sister by an Aes Sedai was heady even for someone of her rank.
Short and of middle years, she had a dark, mature beauty, and the
color in her cheeks set it off. &ldquo;You honor me too greatly, Moiraine
Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine smiled. &ldquo;How long have we known each other,
Amalisa? Must I now call you my Lady Amalisa, as if we had never
sat over tea together?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo; Amalisa smiled back. The strength
evident in her brother&rsquo;s face was in hers, too, and no less for the
softer line of cheek and jaw. There were those who said that as
hard and renowned a fighter as Agelmar was, he was no better than
an even match for his sister. &ldquo;But with the Amyrlin Seat here&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;When King Easar visits Fal Dara, in private I call him
<em>Magami</em>, Little Uncle, as I did when I was a child and he
gave me rides on his shoulder, but in public it must be
different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anaiya <em>tsk</em>ed. &ldquo;Sometimes formality is
necessary, but men often make more of it than they must. Please,
call me Anaiya, and I will call you Amalisa, if I may.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the corner of her eye, Moiraine saw Egwene, far
down the side hall, disappearing hurriedly around a corner. A
stooped shape in a leather jerkin, head down and arms loaded with
bundles, shambled at her heels. Moiraine permitted herself a small
smile, quickly masked. <em>If the girl shows as much initiative in
Tar Valon</em>, she thought wryly, <em>she will sit in the Amyrlin
Seat one day. If she can learn to control that initiative. If there
is an Amyrlin Seat left on which to sit</em>.</p>

<p>When she turned her attention back to the others,
Liandrin was speaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and I would welcome the chance to learn more
of your land.&rdquo; She wore a smile, open and almost girlish, and her
voice was friendly.</p>

<p>Moiraine schooled her face to stillness as Amalisa
extended an invitation to join her and her ladies in her private
garden, and Liandrin accepted warmly. Liandrin made few friends,
and none outside the Red Ajah. <em>Certainly never outside the Aes
Sedai. She would sooner make friends with a man, or a Trolloc</em>.
Moiraine was not sure Liandrin saw much difference between men and
Trollocs. She was not sure any of the Red Ajah did.</p>

<p>Anaiya explained that just now they must attend the
Amyrlin Seat. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Amalisa said. &ldquo;The Light illumine her,
and the Creator shelter her. But later, then.&rdquo; She stood straight
and bowed her head as they left her.</p>

<p>Moiraine studied Liandrin as they walked, never
looking at her directly. The honey-haired Aes Sedai was staring
straight ahead, rosebud lips pursed thoughtfully. She appeared to
have forgotten Moiraine and Anaiya both. <em>What is she up
to?</em></p>

<p>Anaiya seemed not to have noticed anything out of the
ordinary, but then she always managed to accept people both as they
were and as they wanted to be. It constantly amazed Moiraine that
Anaiya dealt as well as she did in the White Tower, but those who
were devious always seemed to take her openness and honesty, her
acceptance of everyone, as cunning devices. They were always caught
completely off balance when she turned out to mean what she said
and say what she meant. Too, she had a way of seeing to the heart
of things. And of accepting what she saw. Now she blithely resumed
speaking of the news.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The word from Andor is both good and bad. The street
riots in Caemlyn died down with the coming of spring, but there is
still talk, too much talk, blaming the Queen, and Tar Valon as
well, for the long winter. Morgase holds her throne less securely
than she did last year, but she holds it still, and will so long as
Gareth Bryne is Captain-General of the Queen&rsquo;s Guards. And the Lady
Elayne, the Daughter-Heir, and her brother, the Lord Gawyn, have
come safely to Tar Valon for their training. There was some fear in
the White Tower that the custom would be broken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not while Morgase has breath in her body,&rdquo; Moiraine
said.</p>

<p>Liandrin gave a little start, as if she had just
awakened. &ldquo;Pray that she continues to have breath. The
Daughter-Heir&rsquo;s party was followed to the River Erinin by the
Children of the Light. To the very bridges to Tar Valon. More still
camp outside Caemlyn, for the chance of mischief, and inside
Caemlyn still are those who listen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is time Morgase learned a little
caution,&rdquo; Anaiya sighed. &ldquo;The world is becoming more dangerous
every day, even for a queen. Perhaps especially for a queen. She
was ever headstrong. I remember when she came to Tar Valon as a
girl. She did not have the ability to become a full sister, and it
rankled in her. Sometimes I think she pushes her daughter because
of that, whatever the girl chooses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine sniffed disdainfully. &ldquo;Elayne was born with
the spark in her; it was not a matter of choosing. Morgase would
not risk letting the girl die from lack of training if all the
Whitecloaks in Amadicia were camped outside Caemlyn. She would
command Gareth Byrne and the Queen&rsquo;s Guards to cut a path through
them to Tar Valon, and Gareth Byrne would do it if he had to do it
alone.&rdquo; <em>But she still must keep the full extent of the girl&rsquo;s
potential secret. Would the people of Andor knowingly accept Elayne
on the Lion Throne after Morgase if they knew? Not just a queen
trained in Tar Valon according to custom, but a full Aes
Sedai?</em> In all of recorded history there had been only a
handful of queens with the right to be called Aes Sedai, and the
few who let it be known had all lived to regret it. She felt a
touch of sadness. But too much was afoot to spare aid, or even
worry, for one land and one throne. &ldquo;What else, Anaiya?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must know that the Great Hunt of the
Horn has been called in Illian, the first time in four hundred
years. The Illianers say the Last Battle is coming&rdquo;&mdash;Anaiya
gave a little shiver, as well she might, but went on without a
pause&mdash;&ldquo;and the Horn of Valere must be found before the final
battle against the Shadow. Men from every land are already
gathering, all eager to be part of the legend, eager to find the
Horn. Murandy and Altara are on their toes, of course, thinking
it&rsquo;s all a mask for a move against one of them. That is probably
why the Murandians caught their false Dragon so quickly. In any
case, there will be a new lot of stories for the bards and gleemen
to add to the cycle. The Light send it is only new stories.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not the stories they expect,&rdquo; Moiraine said.
Liandrin looked at her sharply, and she kept her face still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; Anaiya said placidly. &ldquo;The stories
they least expect will be exactly the ones they will add to the
cycle. Beyond that, I have only rumor to offer. The Sea Folk are
agitated, their ships flying from port to port with barely a pause.
Sisters from the islands say the Coramoor, their Chosen One, is
coming, but they won&rsquo;t say more. You know how closemouthed the
Atha&rsquo;an Miere are with outsiders about the Coramoor, and in this
our sisters seem to think more as Sea Folk than Aes Sedai. The Aiel
appear to be stirring, too, but no one knows why. No one ever knows
with the Aiel. At least there is no evidence they mean to cross the
Spine of the World again, thank the Light.&rdquo; She sighed and shook
her head. &ldquo;What I would not give for even one sister from among the
Aiel. Just one. We know too little of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine laughed. &ldquo;Sometimes I think you belong in
the Brown Ajah, Anaiya.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Almoth Plain,&rdquo; Liandrin said, and looked surprised
that she had spoken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that truly <em>is</em> a rumor, Sister,&rdquo; Anaiya
said. &ldquo;A few whispers heard as we were leaving Tar Valon. There may
be fighting on Almoth Plain, and perhaps Toman Head, as well. I
say, may be. The whispers were faint. Rumors of rumors. We left
before we could hear more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would have to be Tarabon and Arad Doman,&rdquo;
Moiraine said, and shook her head. &ldquo;They have squabbled over Almoth
Plain for nearly three hundred years, but it has never come to open
blows.&rdquo; She looked at Liandrin; Aes Sedai were supposed to throw
off all their old loyalties to lands and rulers, but few did so
completely. It was hard not to care for the land of your birth.
&ldquo;Why would they now&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough of idle talk,&rdquo; the honey-haired woman broke
in angrily. &ldquo;For you, Moiraine, the Amyrlin waits.&rdquo; She took three
quick strides ahead of the others and threw open one of a pair of
tall doors. &ldquo;For you, the Amyrlin will have no idle talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unconsciously touching the pouch at her waist,
Moiraine went past Liandrin through the doorway, with a nod as if
the other woman were holding the door for her. She did not even
smile at the white flash of anger on Liandrin&rsquo;s face. <em>What</em>
is <em>the wretched girl up to?</em></p>

<p>Brightly colored carpets covered the anteroom floor
in layers, and the room was pleasantly furnished with chairs and
cushioned benches and small tables, the wood simply worked or just
polished. Brocaded curtains sided the tall arrowslits to make them
seem more like windows. No fires burned in the fireplaces; the day
was warm, and the Shienaran chill would not come until
nightfall.</p>

<p>Fewer than half a dozen of the Aes Sedai who had
accompanied the Amyrlin were there. Verin Mathwin and Serafelle, of
the Brown Ajah, did not look up at Moiraine&rsquo;s entrance. Serafelle
was intently reading an old book with a worn, faded leather cover,
handling its tattered pages carefully, while plump Verin, sitting
cross-legged beneath an arrowslit, held a small blossom up to the
light and made notes and sketches in a precise hand in a book
balanced on her knee. She had an open inkpot on the floor beside
her, and a small pile of flowers on her lap. The Brown sisters
concerned themselves with little beside seeking knowledge. Moiraine
sometimes wondered if they were really aware of what was going on
in the world, or even immediately around them.</p>

<p>The three other women already in the room turned, but
they made no effort to approach Moiraine, only looked at her. One,
a slender woman of the Yellow Ajah, she did not know; she spent too
little time in Tar Valon to know all the Aes Sedai, although their
numbers were no longer very great. She was acquainted with the two
remaining, however. Carlinya was as pale of skin and cold of manner
as the white fringe on her shawl, the exact opposite in every way
of dark, fiery Alanna Mosvani, of the Green, but they both stood
and stared at her without speaking, without expression. Alanna
sharply snugged her shawl around her, but Carlinya made no move at
all. The slender Yellow sister turned away with an air of
regret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light illumine you all, Sisters,&rdquo; Moiraine said.
No one answered. She was not sure Serafelle or Verin had even
heard. <em>Where are the others?</em> There was no need for them
all to be there&mdash;most would be resting in their rooms,
freshing from the journey&mdash;but she was on edge now, all the
questions she could not ask running through her head. None of it
showed on her face.</p>

<p>The inner door opened, and Leane appeared, without
her gilt-flamed staff. The Keeper of the Chronicles was as tall as
most men, willowy and graceful, still beautiful, with coppery skin
and short, dark hair. She wore a blue stole, a hand wide, instead
of a shawl, for she sat in the Hall of the Tower, though as Keeper,
not to represent her Ajah.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you are,&rdquo; she said briskly to Moiraine, and
gestured to the door behind her. &ldquo;Come, Sister. The Amyrlin Seat is
waiting.&rdquo; She spoke naturally in a clipped, quick way that never
changed, whether she was angry or joyful or excited. As Moiraine
followed Leane in, she wondered what emotion the Keeper was feeling
now. Leane pulled the door to behind them; it banged shut with
something of the sound of a cell door closing.</p>

<p>The Amyrlin Seat herself sat behind a broad table in
the middle of the carpet, and on the table rested a flattened cube
of gold, the size of a travel chest and ornately worked with
silver. The table was heavily built, its legs stout, but it seemed
to squat under a weight two strong men would have had trouble
lifting.</p>

<p>At the sight of the golden cube Moiraine had
difficulty keeping her face unruffled. The last she had seen of it,
it had been safely locked in Agelmar&rsquo;s strongroom. On learning of
the Amyrlin Seat&rsquo;s arrival she had meant to tell her of it herself.
That it was already in the Amyrlin&rsquo;s possession was a trifle, but a
worrisome trifle. Events could be outpacing her.</p>

<p>She swept a deep curtsy and said formally, &ldquo;As you
called me, Mother, so have I come.&rdquo; The Amyrlin extended her hand,
and Moiraine kissed her Great Serpent ring, no different from that
of any other Aes Sedai. Rising, she made her tone more
conversational, but not too much so. She was aware of the Keeper
standing behind her, beside the door. &ldquo;I hope you had a pleasant
journey, Mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin had been born in Tear, of a simple
fisherman&rsquo;s family, not a noble House, and her name was Siuan
Sanche, though very few had used that name, or even thought of it,
in the ten years since she had been raised from the Hall of the
Tower. She was the Amyrlin Seat; that was the whole of it. The
broad stole on her shoulders was striped in the colors of the seven
Ajahs; the Amyrlin was of all Ajahs and of none. She was only of
medium height, and handsome rather than beautiful, but her face
held a strength that had been there before her elevation, the
strength of the girl who had survived the streets of the Maule,
Tear&rsquo;s port district, and her clear blue gaze had made kings and
queens, and even the Captain Commander of the Children of the
Light, drop their eyes. Her own eyes were strained, now, and there
was a new tightness to her mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We called the winds to speed our vessels up the
Erinin, Daughter, and even turned the currents to our aid.&rdquo; The
Amyrlin&rsquo;s voice was deep, and sad. &ldquo;I have seen the flooding we
caused in villages along the river, and the Light only knows what
we have done to the weather. We will not have endeared ourselves by
the damage we&rsquo;ve done and the crops we may have ruined. All to
reach here as quickly as possible.&rdquo; Her eyes strayed to the ornate
golden cube, and she half lifted a hand as if to touch it, but when
she spoke it was to say, &ldquo;Elaida is in Tar Valon, Daughter. She
came with Elayne and Gawyn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine was conscious of Leane standing to one side,
quiet as always in the presence of the Amyrlin. But watching, and
listening. &ldquo;I am surprised, Mother,&rdquo; she said carefully. &ldquo;This is
no time for Morgase to be without Aes Sedai counsel.&rdquo; Morgase was
one of the few rulers to openly admit to an Aes Sedai councilor;
almost all had one, but few admitted it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elaida insisted, Daughter, and queen or not, I doubt
Morgase is a match for Elaida in a contest of wills. In any case,
perhaps this time she did not wish to be. Elayne has potential.
More than I have ever seen before. Already she shows progress. The
Red sisters are swollen up like puff-fish with it. I don&rsquo;t think
the girl leans to their way of thinking, but she is, young, and
there is no telling. Even if they don&rsquo;t manage to bend her, it will
make little difference. Elayne could well be the most powerful Aes
Sedai in a thousand years, and it is the Red Ajah who found her.
They have gained much status in the Hall from the girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have two young women with me in Fal Dara, Mother,&rdquo;
Moiraine said. &ldquo;Both from the Two Rivers, where the blood of
Manetheren still runs strong, though they do not even remember
there was once a land called Manetheren. The old blood sings,
Mother, and it sings loudly in the Two Rivers. Egwene, a village
girl, is at least as strong as Elayne. I have seen the
Daughter-Heir, and I know. As for the other, Nynaeve was the Wisdom
in their village, yet she is little more than a girl herself. It
says something of her that the women of her village chose her
Wisdom at her age. Once she gains conscious control of what she now
does without knowing, she will be as strong as any in Tar Valon.
With training, she will shine like a bonfire beside the candles of
Elayne and Egwene. And there is no chance these two will choose the
Red. They are amused by men, exasperated by them, but they do like
them. They will easily counter whatever influence the Red Ajah
gains in the White Tower from finding Elayne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin nodded as if it were all of no
consequence. Moiraine&rsquo;s eyebrows lifted in surprise before she
caught herself and smoothed her features. Those were the two main
concerns in the Hall of the Tower, that fewer girls who could be
trained to channel the One Power were found every year, or so it
seemed, and that fewer of real power were found. Worse than the
fear in those who blamed Aes Sedai for the Breaking of the World,
worse than the hatred from the Children of the Light, worse even
than the workings of Darkfriends, were the sheer dwindling of
numbers and the lessening of abilities. The corridors of the White
Tower were sparsely populated where once they had been crowded, and
what could once be done easily with the One Power could now be done
only with difficulty, or not at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elaida had another reason for coming to Tar Valon,
Daughter. She sent the same message by six different pigeons to
make sure I received it&mdash;and to whom else in Tar Valon she
sent pigeons, I can only guess&mdash;then came herself. She told
the Hall of the Tower that you are meddling with a young man who is
<em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, and dangerous. He was in Caemlyn, she said, but
when she found the inn where he had been staying, she discovered
you had spirited him away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The people at that inn served us well and
faithfully, Mother. If she harmed any of them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Moiraine could
not keep the sharpness out of her voice, and she heard Leane shift.
One did not speak to the Amyrlin Seat in that tone; not even a king
on his throne did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should know, Daughter,&rdquo; the Amyrlin said dryly,
&ldquo;that Elaida harms no one except those she considers dangerous.
Darkfriends, or those poor fool men who try to channel the One
Power. Or one who threatens Tar Valon. Everyone else who isn&rsquo;t Aes
Sedai might as well be pieces on a stones board as far as she is
concerned. Luckily for him, the innkeeper, one Master Gill as I
remember, apparently thinks much of Aes Sedai, and so answered her
questions to her satisfaction. Elaida actually spoke well of him.
But she spoke more of the young man you took away with you. More
dangerous than any man since Artur Hawkwing, she said. She has the
Foretelling sometimes, you know, and her words carried weight with
the Hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For Leane&rsquo;s sake, Moiraine made her voice as meek as
she could. That was not very meek, but it was the best she could
do. &ldquo;I have three young men with me, Mother, but none of them is a
king, and I doubt very much if any of them even dreams of uniting
the world under one ruler. No one has dreamed Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s
dream since the War of the Hundred Years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Daughter. Village youths, so Lord Agelmar tells
me. But one of them is <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>.&rdquo; The Amyrlin&rsquo;s eyes
strayed to the flattened cube again. &ldquo;It was put forward in the
Hall that you should be sent into retreat for contemplation. This
was proposed by one of the Sitters for the Green Ajah, with the
other two nodding approval as she spoke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leane made a sound of disgust, or perhaps
frustration. She always kept in the background when the Amyrlin
Seat spoke, but Moiraine could understand the small interruption
this time. The Green Ajah had been allied with the Blue for a
thousand years; since Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s time, they had all but
spoken with one voice. &ldquo;I have no desire to hoe vegetables in some
remote village, Mother.&rdquo; <em>Nor will I, whatever the Hall of the
Tower says</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was further proposed, also by the Greens, that
your care during your retreat should be given to the Red Ajah. The
Red Sitters tried to appear surprised, but they looked like
fisher-birds who knew the catch was unguarded.&rdquo; The Amyrlin
sniffed. &ldquo;The Reds professed reluctance to take custody of one not
of their Ajah, but said they would accede to the wishes of the
Hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite herself, Moiraine shivered. &ldquo;That would be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;most unpleasant, Mother.&rdquo; It would be worse than unpleasant,
much worse; the Reds were never gentle. She put the thought of it
firmly to one side, to deal with later. &ldquo;Mother, I cannot
understand this apparent alliance between the Greens and the Reds.
Their beliefs, their attitudes toward men, their views of our very
purposes as Aes Sedai, are completely opposite. A Red and a Green
cannot even talk to each other without coming to shouts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Things change, Daughter. I am the fifth in a row
raised to the Amyrlin Seat from the Blue. Perhaps they feel that is
too many, or that the Blue way of thinking no longer suffices in a
world full of false Dragons. After a thousand years, many things
change.&rdquo; The Amyrlin grimaced and spoke as if to herself. &ldquo;Old
walls weaken, and old barriers fall.&rdquo; She shook herself, and her
voice firmed. &ldquo;There was yet another proposal, one that still
smells like week-old fish on the jetty. Since Leane is of the Blue
Ajah and I came from the Blue, it was put forward that sending two
sisters of the Blue with me on this journey would give the Blue
four representatives. Proposed in the Hall, to my face, as if they
were discussing repairing the drains. Two of the White Sitters
stood against me, and two Green. The Yellow muttered among
themselves, then would not speak for or against. One more saying
nay, and your sisters Anaiya and Maigan would not be here. There
was even some talk, open talk, that I should not leave the White
Tower at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine felt a greater shock than on hearing that
the Red Ajah wanted her in their hands. Whatever Ajah she came
from, the Keeper of the Chronicles spoke only for the Amyrlin, and
the Amyrlin spoke for all Aes Sedai and all Ajahs. That was the way
it had always been, and no one had ever suggested otherwise, not in
the darkest days of the Trolloc Wars, not when Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s
armies had penned every surviving Aes Sedai inside Tar Valon. Above
all, the Amyrlin Seat was the Amyrlin Seat. Every Aes Sedai was
pledged to obey her. No one could question what she did or where
she chose to go. This proposal went against three thousand years of
custom and law.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who would dare, Mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin Seat&rsquo;s laugh was bitter. &ldquo;Almost anyone,
Daughter. Riots in Caemlyn. The Great Hunt called without any of us
having a hint of it until the proclamation. False Dragons popping
up like redbells after a rain. Nations fading, and more nobles
playing at the Game of Houses than at any time since Artur Hawkwing
cut all their plottings short. And worst of all, every one of us
knows the Dark One is stirring again. Show me a sister who does not
think the White Tower is losing its grip on events, and if she is
not Brown Ajah, she is dead. Time may be growing short for all of
us, Daughter. Sometimes I think I can almost feel it growing
shorter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you say, Mother, things change. But there are
still worse perils outside the Shining Walls than within.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a long moment the Amyrlin met Moiraine&rsquo;s gaze,
then nodded slowly. &ldquo;Leave us, Leane. I would talk to my Daughter
Moiraine alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was only a moment&rsquo;s hesitation before Leane
said, &ldquo;As you wish, Mother.&rdquo; Moiraine could feel her surprise. The
Amyrlin gave few audiences without the Keeper present, especially
not to a sister she had reason to chastise.</p>

<p>The door opened and closed behind Leane. She would
not say a word in the anteroom of what had occurred inside, but the
news that Moiraine was alone with the Amyrlin would spread through
the Aes Sedai in Fal Dara like wildfire through a dry forest, and
the speculation would begin.</p>

<p>As soon as the door closed the Amyrlin stood, and
Moiraine felt a momentary tingle in her skin as the other woman
channeled the One Power. For an instant, the Amyrlin Seat seemed to
her to be surrounded by a nimbus of bright light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that any of the others have your old
trick,&rdquo; the Amyrlin Seat said, lightly touching the blue stone on
Moiraine&rsquo;s forehead with one finger, &ldquo;but most of us have some
small tricks remembered from childhood. In any event, no one can
hear what we say now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly she threw her arms around Moiraine, a warm
hug between old friends; Moiraine hugged back as warmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are the only one, Moiraine, with whom I can
remember who I was. Even Leane always acts as if I had
<em>become</em> the stole and the staff, even when we are alone, as
if we&rsquo;d never giggled together as novices. Sometimes I wish we
still were novices, you and I. Still innocent enough to see it all
as a gleeman&rsquo;s tale come true, still innocent enough to think we
would find men&mdash;they would be princes, remember, handsome and
strong and gentle?&mdash;who could bear to live with women of an
Aes Sedai&rsquo;s power. Still innocent enough to dream of the happy
ending to the gleeman&rsquo;s tale, of living our lives as other women
do, just with more than they.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are Aes Sedai, Siuan. We have our duty. Even if
you and I had not been born to channel, would you give it up for a
home and a husband, even a prince? I do not believe it. That is a
village goodwife&rsquo;s dream. Not even the Greens go so far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin stepped back. &ldquo;No, I would not give it
up. Most of the time, no. But there have been times I envied that
village goodwife. At this moment, I almost do. Moiraine, if anyone,
even Leane, discovers what we plan, we will both be stilled. And I
can&rsquo;t say they would be wrong to do it.&rdquo;</p>
