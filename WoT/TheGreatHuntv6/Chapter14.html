<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">G</span>one?&rdquo;
Ingtar demanded of the air. &ldquo;And my guards
saw nothing. Nothing! They cannot just be gone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Listening, Perrin hunched his shoulders and looked at
Mat, who stood a little way off frowning and muttering to himself.
Arguing with himself was how Perrin saw it. The sun was peeking
over the horizon, past time for them to have been riding. Shadows
lay long across the hollow, stretched out and thinned, but still
like the trees that made them. The packhorses, loaded and on their
lead line, stamped impatiently, but everyone stood by his mount and
waited.</p>

<p>Uno came striding up. &ldquo;Not a goat-kissing track, my
Lord.&rdquo; He sounded offended; failure touched on his skill. &ldquo;Burn me,
not so much as a flaming hoof scrape. They just bloody
vanished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three men and three horses do not just vanish,&rdquo;
Ingtar growled. &ldquo;Go over the ground again, Uno. If anyone can find
where they went, it&rsquo;s you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe they just ran away,&rdquo; Mat said. Uno stopped and
glared at him. <em>Like he&rsquo;d cursed an Aes Sedai</em>, Perrin
thought wonderingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why would they run away?&rdquo; Ingtar&rsquo;s voice was
dangerously soft. &ldquo;Rand, the Builder, my sniffer&mdash;my sniffer!&mdash;why would any of them run, much less all three?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat shrugged. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Rand was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Perrin
wanted to throw something at him, hit him, anything to stop him,
but Ingtar and Uno were watching. He felt a flood of relief when
Mat hesitated, then spread his hands and muttered, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
why. I just thought maybe they had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ingtar grimaced. &ldquo;Ran away,&rdquo; he growled as if he did
not believe it for an instant. &ldquo;The Builder can go as he will, but
Hurin would not run away. And neither would Rand al&rsquo;Thor. He would
not; he knows his duty, now. Go on, Uno. Search the ground again.&rdquo;
Uno gave a half bow and hurried away, sword hilt bobbing over his
shoulder. Ingtar grumbled, &ldquo;Why would Hurin leave like that, in the
middle of the night, without a word? He knows what we&rsquo;re about. How
am I to track this Shadow-spawned filth without him? I would give a
thousand gold crowns for a pack of trail hounds. If I did not know
better, I would say the Darkfriends managed this so they can slip
east or west without me knowing. Peace, I don&rsquo;t know if I <em>
do</em> know better.&rdquo; He stumped off after Uno.</p>

<p>Perrin shifted uneasily. The Darkfriends were
doubtless getting further away with every minute. Getting further
away, and with them the Horn of Valere&mdash;and the dagger from
Shadar Logoth. He did not think that Rand, whatever he had become,
whatever had happened to him, would abandon that chase. <em>But
where</em> did <em>he go, and why?</em> Loial might go with Rand
for friendship&mdash;but why Hurin?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe he did run away,&rdquo; he muttered, then looked
around. No one appeared to have heard; even Mat was not paying him
any mind. He scrubbed a hand through his hair. If Aes Sedai had
been after him to be a false Dragon, he would have run, too. But
worrying about Rand was doing nothing to help track the
Darkfriends.</p>

<p>There was a way, perhaps, if he was willing to take
it. He did not want to take it. He had been running away from it,
but perhaps, now, he could no longer run. <em>Serves me right for
what I told Rand. I wish I</em> could <em>run</em>. Even knowing
what he could do to help&mdash;what he had to do&mdash;he
hesitated.</p>

<p>No one was looking at him. No one would know what
they were seeing even if they did look. Finally, reluctantly, he
closed his eyes and let himself drift, let his thoughts drift, out,
away from him.</p>

<p>He had tried denying it from the first, long before
his eyes began to change from dark brown to burnished golden
yellow. At that first meeting, that first instant of recognition,
he had refused to believe, and he had run from the recognition ever
since. He still wanted to run.</p>

<p>His thoughts drifted, feeling for what must be out
there, what was always out there in country where men were few or
far between, feeling for his brothers. He did not like to think of
them that way, but they were.</p>

<p>In the beginning he had been afraid that what he did
had some taint of the Dark One, or of the One Power&mdash;equally
bad for a man who wanted nothing more than to be a blacksmith and
live his life in the Light, and in peace. From that time, he knew
something of how Rand felt, afraid of himself, feeling unclean. He
was still not past that entirely. This thing he did was older than
humans using the One Power, though, something from the birth of
Time. Not the Power, Moiraine had told him. Something long
vanished, now come again. Egwene knew, too, though he wished she
did not. He wished no one did. He hoped she had not told
anyone.</p>

<p>Contact. He felt them, felt other minds. Felt his
brothers, the wolves.</p>

<p>Their thoughts came to him as a whirlpool blend of
images and emotions. At first he had not been able to make out
anything except the raw emotion, but now his mind put words to
them. <em>Wolfbrother. Surprise. Two-legs that talks</em>. A faded
image, dim with time, old beyond old, of men running with wolves,
two packs hunting together. <em>We have heard this comes again. You
are Long Tooth?</em></p>

<p>It was a faint picture of a man dressed in clothes
made of hides, with a long knife in his hand, but overlaid on the
image, more central, was a shaggy wolf with one tooth longer than
the rest, a steel tooth gleaming in the sunlight as the wolf led
the pack in a desperate charge through deep snow toward the deer
that would mean life instead of slow death by starvation, and the
deer thrashing to run in powder to their bellies, and the sun
glinting on the white until it hurt the eyes, and the wind howling
down the passes, swirling the fine snow like mist, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Wolves&rsquo; names were always complex images.</p>

<p>Perrin recognized the man. Elyas Machera, who had
first introduced him to wolves. Sometimes he wished he had never
met Elyas.</p>

<p><em>No</em>, he thought, and tried to picture himself
in his mind.</p>

<p><em>Yes. We have heard of you</em>.</p>

<p>It was not the image he had made, a young man with
heavy shoulders and shaggy, brown curls, a young man with an axe at
his belt, who others thought moved and thought slowly. That man was
there, somewhere in the mind picture that came from the wolves, but
stronger by far was a massive, wild bull with curved horns of
shining metal, running through the night with the speed and
exuberance of youth, curly-haired coat gleaming in the moonlight,
flinging himself in among Whitecloaks on their horses, with the air
crisp and cold and dark, and blood so red on the horns, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Young Bull</em>.</p>

<p>For a moment Perrin lost the contact in his shock. He
had not dreamed they had given him a name. He wished he could not
remember how he had earned it. He touched the axe at his belt, with
its gleaming, half-moon blade. <em>Light help me, I killed two men.
They would have killed me even quicker, and Egwene, but</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pushing all that aside&mdash;it was done and behind
him; he had no wish to remember any of it&mdash;he gave the wolves
the smell of Rand, of Loial and Hurin, and asked if they had
scented the three. It was one of the things that had come to him
with the change in his eyes; he could identify people by their
smell even when he could not see them. He could see more sharply,
too, see in anything but pitch-darkness. He was always careful to
light lamps or candles, now, sometimes before anyone else thought
they were needed.</p>

<p>From the wolves came a view of men on horses
approaching the hollow in late day. That was the last they had seen
or smelled of Rand or the other two.</p>

<p>Perrin hesitated. The next step would be useless
unless he told Ingtar. <em>And Mat will die if we don&rsquo;t find that
dagger. Burn you, Rand, why did you take the sniffer?</em></p>

<p>The one time he had gone to the dungeon, with Egwene,
the smell of Fain had made his hair stand on end; not even Trollocs
smelled so foul. He had wanted to rip through the bars of the cell
and tear the man apart, and finding that inside himself had
frightened him more than Fain did. To mask Fain&rsquo;s smell in his own
mind, he added the scent of Trollocs before he howled aloud.</p>

<p>From the distance came the cries of a wolfpack, and
in the hollow horses stamped and whickered fearfully. Some of the
soldiers fingered their longbladed lances and eyed the rim of the
hollow uneasily. Inside Perrin&rsquo;s head, it was much worse. He felt
the rage of the wolves, the hate. There were only two things wolves
hated. All else they merely endured, but fire and Trollocs they
hated, and they would go through fire to kill Trollocs.</p>

<p>Even more than the Trollocs, Fain&rsquo;s scent had put
them into a frenzy, as if they smelled something that made Trollocs
seem natural and right.</p>

<p><em>Where?</em></p>

<p>The sky rolled in his head; the land spun. East and
west, wolves did not know. They knew the movements of sun and moon,
the shift of seasons, the contours of the land. Perrin puzzled it
out. South. And something more. An eagerness to kill the Trollocs.
The wolves would let Young Bull share in the killing. He could
bring the two-legs with their hard skins if he wanted, but Young
Bull, and Smoke, and Two Deer, and Winter Dawn, and all the rest of
the pack would hunt down the Twisted Ones who had dared come into
their land. The inedible flesh and bitter blood would burn the
tongue, but they must be killed. Kill them. Kill the Twisted
Ones.</p>

<p>Their fury infected him. His lips peeled back in a
snarl, and he took a step, to join them, run with them in the hunt,
in the killing.</p>

<p>With an effort he broke the contact except for a thin
sense that the wolves were there. He could have pointed to them
across the intervening distance. He felt cold inside. <em>I&rsquo;m a
man, not a wolf. Light help me, I am a man!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you well, Perrin?&rdquo; Mat said, moving closer. He
sounded the way he always did, flippant&mdash;and bitter under it,
too, of late&mdash;but he looked worried. &ldquo;That is all I need.
Rand run off, and then you get sick. I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;ll find a
Wisdom to look after you out here. I think I have some willowbark
in my saddlebags. I can make you some willowbark tea, if Ingtar
lets us stay that long. Serve you right if I make it too
strong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m all right, Mat.&rdquo; Shaking off his friend,
he went to find Ingtar. The Shienaran lord was scanning the ground
on the rim with Uno, and Ragan, and Masema. The others frowned at
him as he drew Ingtar aside. He made sure Uno and the rest were too
far away to hear before he spoke. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where Rand or the
others went, Ingtar, but Padan Fain and the Trollocs&mdash;and I
guess the rest of the Darkfriends&mdash;are still heading
south.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know this?&rdquo; Ingtar said.</p>

<p>Perrin drew a deep breath. &ldquo;Wolves told me.&rdquo; He
waited, for what he was not sure. Laughter, scorn, an accusation of
being a Darkfriend, of being mad. Deliberately, he tucked his
thumbs behind his belt, away from the axe. <em>I will not kill. Not
again. If he tries to kill me for a Darkfriend, I&rsquo;ll run, but I
won&rsquo;t kill anybody else</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard of things like this,&rdquo; Ingtar said
slowly, after a moment. &ldquo;Rumors. There was a Warder, a man called
Elyas Machera, who some said could talk to wolves. He disappeared
years ago.&rdquo; He seemed to catch something in Perrin&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;You
know him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know him,&rdquo; Perrin said flatly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the one&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it. I didn&rsquo;t ask for it.&rdquo; <em>That&rsquo;s
what Rand said. Light, I wish I were home working Master Luhhan&rsquo;s
forge</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These wolves,&rdquo; Ingtar said, &ldquo;they will track the
Darkfriends and Trollocs for us?&rdquo; Perrin nodded. &ldquo;Good. I will have
the Horn, whatever it takes.&rdquo; The Shienaran glanced around at Uno
and the others still searching for tracks. &ldquo;Better not to tell
anyone else, though. Wolves are considered good luck in the
Borderlands. Trollocs fear them. But still, better to keep this
between us for the time. Some of them might not understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would as soon nobody else ever found out,&rdquo; Perrin
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell them you think you have Hurin&rsquo;s talent.
They know about that; they&rsquo;re easy with it. Some of them saw you
wrinkling your nose back in that village, and at the ferry. I&rsquo;ve
heard jokes about your delicate nose. Yes. You keep us on the trail
today, Uno will see enough of their tracks to confirm it is the
trail, and before nightfall every last man will be sure you are a
sniffer. I <em>will</em> have the Horn.&rdquo; He glanced at the sky, and
raised his voice. &ldquo;Daylight is wasting! To horse!&rdquo;</p>

<p>To Perrin&rsquo;s surprise, the Shienarans seemed to accept
Ingtar&rsquo;s story. A few of them looked skeptical&mdash;Masema went
so far as to spit&mdash;but Uno nodded thoughtfully, and that was
enough for most. Mat was the hardest to convince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A sniffer! You? You&rsquo;re going to track murderers by
smell? Perrin, you are as crazy as Rand. I am the only sane one
left from Emond&rsquo;s Field, with Egwene and Nynaeve trotting off to
Tar Valon to become&mdash;&rdquo; He cut himself short with an uneasy
glance for the Shienarans.</p>

<p>Perrin took Hurin&rsquo;s place beside Ingtar as the small
column rode south. Mat kept up a string of disparaging remarks,
until Uno found the first tracks left by Trollocs and by men on
horses, but Perrin paid him little mind. It was all he could do to
keep the wolves from dashing on ahead to kill the Trollocs. The
wolves cared only about killing the Twisted Ones; to them,
Darkfriends were no different from any other two-legs. Perrin could
almost see the Darkfriends scattering in a dozen directions while
the wolves slew Trollocs, running away with the Horn of Valere.
Running away with the dagger. And once the Trollocs were dead, he
did not think he could interest the wolves in tracking the humans
even if he had any idea which of them to track. He had a running
argument with them, and sweat covered his forehead long before he
got the first flash of images that turned his stomach.</p>

<p>He drew rein, stopping his horse dead. The others did
the same, looking at him, waiting. He stared straight ahead and
cursed softly, bitterly.</p>

<p>Wolves would kill men, but men were not a preferred
prey. Wolves remembered the old hunting together, for one thing,
and two-legs tasted bad, for another. Wolves were more particular
about their food than he would have believed. They would not eat
carrion, unless they were starving, and few would kill more than
they could eat. What Perrin felt from the wolves could best be
described as disgust. And there were the images. He could see them
much more clearly than he wished. Bodies, men and women and
children, heaped and tumbled about. Blood-soaked earth churned by
hooves and frenzied attempts to escape. Torn flesh. Heads severed.
Vultures flapping, their white wings stained red; bloody,
featherless heads tearing and gorging. He broke loose before his
stomach emptied itself.</p>

<p>Above some trees in the far distance he could just
make out black specks whirling low, dropping then rising again.
Vultures fighting over their meal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something bad up there.&rdquo; He swallowed,
meeting Ingtar&rsquo;s gaze. How could he fit telling them into the story
of being a sniffer? <em>I don&rsquo;t want to get close enough to look at
that. But they&rsquo;ll want to investigate once they can see the
vultures. I have to tell them enough so they&rsquo;ll circle around</em>.
&ldquo;The people from that village&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I think the Trollocs killed
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uno began cursing quietly, and some of the other
Shienarans muttered to themselves. None of them seemed to take his
announcement as odd, though. Lord Ingtar said he was a sniffer, and
sniffers could smell killing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And there is someone following us,&rdquo; Ingtar said.</p>

<p>Mat turned his horse eagerly. &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s Rand. I
knew he wouldn&rsquo;t run out on me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thin, scattered puffs of dust rose to the north; a
horse was running across patches where the grass grew thin. The
Shienarans spread out, lances ready, watching in all directions. It
was no place to be casual about a stranger.</p>

<p>A speck appeared&mdash;a horse and rider; a woman,
to Perrin&rsquo;s eyes, long before anyone else could discern the rider&mdash;and quickly drew closer. She slowed to a trot as she came up
on them, fanning herself with one hand. A plump, graying woman,
with her cloak tied behind her saddle, who blinked at them all
vaguely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Mat said
disappointedly. &ldquo;I recognize her. Verin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Verin Sedai,&rdquo; Ingtar said sharply, then bowed to her
from his saddle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moiraine Sedai sent me, Lord Ingtar,&rdquo; Verin
announced with a satisfied smile. &ldquo;She thought you might need me.
Such a gallop I&rsquo;ve had. I thought I might not catch you short of
Cairhien. You saw that village, of course? Oh, that was very nasty,
wasn&rsquo;t it? And that Myrddraal. There were ravens and crows all over
the rooftops, but never a one went near it, dead as it was. I had
to wave away the Dark One&rsquo;s own weight in flies, though, before I
could make out what it was. A shame I did not have time to take it
down. I&rsquo;ve never had a chance to study a&mdash;&rdquo; Suddenly her eyes
narrowed, and the absent manner vanished like smoke. &ldquo;Where is Rand
al&rsquo;Thor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ingtar grimaced. &ldquo;Gone, Verin Sedai. Vanished last
night, without a trace. Him, the Ogier, and Hurin, one of my
men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Ogier, Lord Ingtar? And your sniffer went with
him? What would those two have in common with&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; Ingtar gaped
at her, and she snorted. &ldquo;Did you think you could keep something
like that secret?&rdquo; She snorted again. &ldquo;Sniffers. Vanished, you
say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Verin Sedai.&rdquo; Ingtar sounded unsettled. It was
never easy discovering Aes Sedai knew the secrets you were trying
to keep from them; Perrin hoped Moiraine had not told anyone about
him. &ldquo;But I have&mdash;I have a new sniffer.&rdquo; The Shienaran Lord
gestured to Perrin. &ldquo;This man seems to have the ability, also. I
will find the Horn of Valere, as I swore to, have no fear. Your
company will be welcome, Aes Sedai, if you wish to ride with us.&rdquo;
To Perrin&rsquo;s surprise, he did not sound as if he entirely meant
it.</p>

<p>Verin glanced at Perrin, and he shifted uneasily. &ldquo;A
new sniffer, just when you lose your old one. How&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;providential. You found no tracks? No, of course not. You said no
trace. Odd. Last night.&rdquo; She twisted in her saddle, looking back
north, and for a moment Perrin almost thought she was going to ride
back the way she had come.</p>

<p>Ingtar frowned at her. &ldquo;You think their disappearance
has something to do with the Horn, Aes Sedai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verin settled back. &ldquo;The Horn? No. No, I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;think
not. But it is odd. Very odd. I do not like odd things until I can
understand them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can have two men escort you back to where they
disappeared, Verin Sedai. They will have no trouble taking you
right to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. If you say they vanished without a trace&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;
For a long moment she studied Ingtar, her face unreadable. &ldquo;I will
ride with you. Perhaps we will find them again, or they will find
us. Talk to me as we ride, Lord Ingtar. Tell me everything you can
about the young man. Everything he did, everything he said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They started off in a jingle of harness and armor,
Verin riding close beside Ingtar and questioning him closely, but
too low to be overheard. She gave Perrin a look when he tried to
maintain his place, and he fell back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Rand she&rsquo;s after,&rdquo; Mat murmured, &ldquo;not the
Horn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin nodded. <em>Wherever you&rsquo;ve gotten to, Rand,
stay there. It&rsquo;s safer than here</em>.</p>
