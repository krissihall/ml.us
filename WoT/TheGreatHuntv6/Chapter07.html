<h4><em>Blood Calls Blood</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">A</span>s
the litter carrying Mat left the Amyrlin Seat&rsquo;s
chambers, Moiraine carefully rewrapped the <em>angreal</em>&mdash;a small, age-darkened ivory carving of a woman in flowing robes&mdash;in a square of silk and put it back into her pouch. Working
together with other Aes Sedai, merging their abilities, channeling
the flow of the One Power to a single task, was tiring work under
the best conditions, even with the aid of an <em>angreal</em>, and
working through the night without sleep was not the best
conditions. And the work they had done on the boy had not been
easy.</p>

<p>Leane directed the litter bearers out with sharp
gestures and a few crisp words. The two men kept ducking their
heads, nervous at being around so many Aes Sedai at once, and one
of them the Amyrlin herself, never mind that the Aes Sedai had been
using the Power. They had waited in the corridor, squatting against
the wall while the work was done, and they were anxious to be gone
from the women&rsquo;s apartments. Mat lay with his eyes closed and his
face pale, but his chest rose and fell in the even rhythm of a deep
sleep.</p>

<p><em>How will this affect matters?</em> Moiraine wondered.
<em>He is not necessary with the Horn gone, and yet</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The door closed behind Leane and the litter bearers,
and the Amyrlin drew an unsteady breath. &ldquo;A nasty business that.
Nasty.&rdquo; Her face was smooth, but she rubbed her hands together as
if she wanted to wash them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But quite interesting,&rdquo; Verin said. She had been the
fourth Aes Sedai the Amyrlin had chosen for the work. &ldquo;It is too
bad we&mdash;I&mdash;do not have the dagger so the Healing could
be complete. For all we did tonight, he will not live long. Months,
perhaps, at best.&rdquo; The three Aes Sedai were alone in the Amyrlin&rsquo;s
chambers. Beyond the arrowslits dawn pearled the sky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he will have those months, now,&rdquo; Moiraine said
sharply. &ldquo;And if it can be retrieved, the link can still be
broken.&rdquo; <em>If it can be retrieved. Yes, of course</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can still be broken,&rdquo; Verin agreed. She was a
plump, square-faced woman, and even with the Aes Sedai gift of
agelessness, there was a touch of gray in her brown hair. That was
her only sign of age, but for an Aes Sedai it meant she was very
old indeed. Her voice held steady, though, matching her smooth
cheeks. &ldquo;He has been linked to the dagger a long time, however, as
a thing like that must be reckoned. And he will be linked longer
yet, whether it is found or not. He may already be changed beyond
the reach of full Healing, even if no longer enough to contaminate
others. Such a small thing, that dagger,&rdquo; she mused, &ldquo;but it will
corrupt whoever carries it long enough. He who carries it will in
turn corrupt those who come in contact with him, and they will
corrupt still others, and the hatred and suspicion that destroyed
Shadar Logoth, every man and woman&rsquo;s hand turned against every
other, will be loose in the world again. I wonder how many people
it can taint in, say, a year. It should be possible to calculate a
reasonable approximation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine gave the Brown sister a wry look. <em>Another
danger confronts us, and she sounds as if it is a puzzle in a book.
Light, the Browns truly are not aware of the world at all</em>.
&ldquo;Then we must find the dagger, Sister. Agelmar is sending men to
hunt those who took the Horn and slew his oathmen, the same who
took the dagger. If one is found, the other will be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verin nodded, but frowned at the same time. &ldquo;Yet,
even if it is found, who can return it safely? Whoever touches it
risks the taint if they handle it long. Perhaps in a chest, well
wrapped and padded, but it would still be dangerous to those nearby
for any great time. Without the dagger itself to study, we cannot
be sure how much it must be shielded. But you saw it and more,
Moiraine. You dealt with it, enough for that young man to survive
carrying it and to stop him infecting others. You must have a good
idea of how strong its influence is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one,&rdquo; Moiraine said, &ldquo;who can retrieve the
dagger without being harmed by it. One whom we have shielded and
buffered against that taint as much as anyone can be. Mat
Cauthon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin nodded. &ldquo;Yes, of course. He can do it. If
he lives long enough. The Light only knows how far it will be
carried before Agelmar&rsquo;s men find it. If they do find it. And if
the boy dies first&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well, if the dagger is loose that long, we
have another worry.&rdquo; She rubbed her eyes tiredly. &ldquo;I think we must
find this Padan Fain, too. Why is this Darkfriend important enough
for them to risk what they did to rescue him? Much easier for them
just to steal the Horn. Still risky as a winter gale in the Sea of
Storms, coming into the very keep like that, but they compounded
their risk to free this Darkfriend. If the Lurks think he is that
important&rdquo;&mdash;she paused, and Moiraine knew she was wondering if
it truly was still only the Myrddraal giving commands&mdash;&ldquo;then so
must we.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must be found,&rdquo; Moiraine agreed, hoping that none
of the urgency she felt showed, &ldquo;but it is likely he will be found
with the Horn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you say, Daughter.&rdquo; The Amyrlin pressed fingers
to her lips to stifle a yawn. &ldquo;And now, Verin, if you will excuse
me, I will just say a few words to Moiraine and then sleep a
little. I suppose Agelmar will insist on feasting tonight since
last night was spoiled. Your help was invaluable, Daughter. Please
remember, say nothing of the nature of the boy&rsquo;s hurt to anyone.
There are some of your sisters who would see the Shadow in him
instead of a thing men made on their own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no need to name the Red Ajah. And perhaps,
Moiraine thought, the Reds were no longer the only ones of whom it
was necessary to be wary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will say nothing, of course, Mother.&rdquo; Verin bowed,
but made no move toward the door. &ldquo;I thought you might wish to see
this, Mother.&rdquo; She pulled a small notebook, bound in soft, brown
leather, from her belt. &ldquo;What was written on the walls in the
dungeon. There were few problems with translation. Most was the
usual&mdash;blasphemy and boasting; Trollocs seem to know little
else&mdash;but there was one part done in a better hand. An
educated Darkfriend, or perhaps a Myrddraal. It could be only
taunting, yet it has the form of poetry, or song, and the sound of
prophecy. We know little of prophecies from the Shadow,
Mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin hesitated only a moment before nodding.
Prophecies from the Shadow, dark prophecies, had an unfortunate way
of being fulfilled as well as prophecies from the Light. &ldquo;Read it
to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verin ruffled through the pages, then cleared her
throat and began in a calm, level voice.</p>

<p class="verse_quote">&ldquo;Daughter of the Night, she walks again.<br>
The ancient war, she yet fights.<br>
Her new lover she seeks, who shall serve her and die, yet serve still.<br>
Who shall stand against her coming?<br>

Blood feeds blood.<br>
Blood calls blood.<br>
Blood is, and blood was, and blood shall ever be.</p>

<p class="verse">The man who channels stands alone.<br>
He gives his friends for sacrifice.<br>
Two roads before him, one to death beyond dying, one to life eternal.<br>
Which will he choose? Which will he choose?<br>

Blood feeds blood.<br>

Blood is, and blood was, and blood shall ever be.</p>

<p class="verse">Luc came to the Mountains of Dhoom.<br>
Isam waited in the high passes.<br>
The hunt is now begun. The Shadow&rsquo;s hounds now course, and kill.<br>
One did live, and one did die, but both are.<br>
The Time of Change has come.<br>

Blood is, and blood was, and blood shall ever be.</p>

<p class="verse">The Watchers wait on Toman&rsquo;s Head.<br>

Now the Great Lord comes.<br>
Now the Great Lord comes.<br>
Blood feeds blood.<br>

Blood is, and blood was, and blood shall ever be.<br>
Now the Great Lord comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a long silence when she finished.</p>

<p>Finally the Amyrlin said, &ldquo;Who else has seen this,
Daughter? Who knows of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only Serafelle, Mother. As soon as we had copied it
down, I had men scrub the walls. They didn&rsquo;t question; they were
eager to be rid of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin nodded. &ldquo;Good. Too many in the
Borderlands can puzzle out Trolloc script. No need to give them
something else to worry over. They have enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you make of it?&rdquo; Moiraine asked Verin in a
careful voice. &ldquo;Is it prophecy, do you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verin tilted her head, peering at her notes in
thought. &ldquo;Possibly. It has the form of some of the few dark
prophecies we know. And parts of it are clear enough. It could
still be only a taunt, though.&rdquo; She rested a finger on one line.
&ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;Daughter of the Night, she walks again.&rsquo; That can only mean
Lanfear is loose again. Or someone wants us to think she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be something to worry us, Daughter,&rdquo; the
Amyrlin Seat said, &ldquo;if it were true. But the Forsaken are still
bound.&rdquo; She glanced at Moiraine, looking troubled for an instant
before she schooled her features. &ldquo;Even if the seals <em>are</em>
weakening, the Forsaken are still bound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lanfear. In the Old Tongue, Daughter of the Night.
Nowhere was her real name recorded, but that was the name she had
taken for herself, unlike most of the Forsaken, who had been named
by those they betrayed. Some said she had really been the most
powerful of the Forsaken, next to Ishamael, the Betrayer of Hope,
but had kept her powers hidden. Too little was left from that time
for any scholar to say for certain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With all the false Dragons that are appearing, it is
not surprising someone would try to bring Lanfear into it.&rdquo;
Moiraine&rsquo;s voice was as unruffled as her face, but inside herself
she roiled. Only one thing for certain was known of Lanfear beside
the name: before she went over to the Shadow, before Lews Therin
Telamon met Ilyena, Lanfear had been his lover. <em>A complication
we do</em> not <em>need</em>.</p>

<p>The Amyrlin Seat frowned as if she had had the same
thought, but Verin nodded as if it were all just words. &ldquo;Other
names are clear, too, Mother. Lord Luc, of course, was brother to
Tigraine, then the Daughter-Heir of Andor, and he vanished in the
Blight. Who Isam is, or what he has to do with Luc, I do not know,
however.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will find out what we need to know in time,&rdquo;
Moiraine said smoothly. &ldquo;There is no proof as yet that this is
prophecy.&rdquo; She knew the name. Isam had been the son of Breyan, wife
of Lain Mandragoran, whose attempt to seize the throne of Malkier
for her husband had brought the Trolloc hordes crashing down.
Breyan and her infant son had both vanished when the Trollocs
overran Malkier. And Isam had been blood kin to Lan. <em>Or</em> is
<em>blood kin? I must keep this from him, until I know how he will
react. Until we are away from the Blight. If he thought Isam were
alive</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;The Watchers wait on Toman Head,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; Verin went on.
&ldquo;There are a few who still cling to the old belief that the armies
Artur Hawkwing sent across the Aryth Ocean will return one day,
though after all this time&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She gave a disdainful sniff.
&ldquo;The Do Miere A&rsquo;vron, the Watchers Over the Waves, still have a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;community is the best word, I suppose&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;on Toman Head, at
Falme. And one of the old names for Artur Hawkwing was Hammer of
the Light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you suggesting, Daughter,&rdquo; the Amyrlin Seat
said, &ldquo;that Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s armies, or rather their descendants,
might actually return after a thousand years?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are rumors of war on Almoth Plain and Toman
Head,&rdquo; Moiraine said slowly. &ldquo;And Hawkwing sent two of his sons, as
well as armies. If they did survive in whatever lands they found,
there could well be many descendants of Hawkwing. Or none.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin gave Moiraine a guarded look, obviously
wishing they were alone so she could demand to know what Moiraine
was up to. Moiraine made a soothing gesture, and her old friend
grimaced at her.</p>

<p>Verin, with her nose still buried in her notes,
noticed none of it. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Mother. I doubt it, though. We
know nothing at all of those lands Artur Hawkwing set out to
conquer. It&rsquo;s too bad the Sea Folk refuse to cross the Aryth Ocean.
They say the Islands of the Dead lie on the other side. I wish I
knew what they meant by that, but that accursed Sea Folk
closemouthedness&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She sighed, still not raising her head.
&ldquo;All we have is one reference to &lsquo;lands under the Shadow, beyond
the setting sun, beyond the Aryth Ocean, where the Armies of Night
reign.&rsquo; Nothing there to tell us if the armies Hawkwing sent were
enough by themselves to defeat these &lsquo;Armies of the Night,&rsquo; or even
to survive Hawkwing&rsquo;s death. Once the War of the Hundred Years
started, everyone was too intent on carving out their own part of
Hawkwing&rsquo;s empire to spare a thought for his armies across the sea.
It seems to me, Mother, that if their descendants still lived, and
if they ever intended to return, they would not have waited so
long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you believe it is not prophecy, Daughter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, &lsquo;the ancient tree,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; Verin said, immersed in
her own thoughts. &ldquo;There have always been rumors&mdash;no more
than that&mdash;that while the nation of Almoth still lived, they
had a branch of <em>Avendesora</em>, perhaps even a living sapling.
And the banner of Almoth was &lsquo;blue for the sky above, black for the
earth below, with the spreading Tree of Life to join them.&rsquo; Of
course, Taraboners call themselves the Tree of Man, and claim to be
descended from rulers and nobles in the Age of Legends. And Domani
claim descent from those who made the Tree of Life in the Age of
Legends. There are other possibilities, but you will note, Mother,
that at least three center around Almoth Plain and Toman Head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin&rsquo;s voice became deceptively gentle. &ldquo;Will
you make up your mind, Daughter? If Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s seed is
<em>not</em> returning, then this is not prophecy and it doesn&rsquo;t
matter a rotted fish head what ancient tree is meant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can only give you what I know, Mother,&rdquo; Verin
said, looking up from her notes, &ldquo;and leave the decision in your
hands. I believe the last of Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s foreign armies died
long ago, but because I believe it does not make it so. The Time of
Change, of course, refers to the end of an Age, and the Great Lord&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amyrlin slapped the tabletop like a thunderclap.
&ldquo;I know very well who the Great Lord is, Daughter. I think you had
better go now.&rdquo; She took a deep breath, and took hold of herself
visibly. &ldquo;Go, Verin. I do not want to become angry with you. I do
not want to forget who it was had the cooks leave sweetcakes out at
night when I was a novice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; Moiraine said, &ldquo;there is nothing in this to
suggest prophecy. Anyone with a little wit and a little knowledge
could put together as much, and no one has ever said Myrddraal do
not have a sly wit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And of course,&rdquo; Verin said calmly, &ldquo;the man who
channels must be one of the three young men traveling with you,
Moiraine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine stared in shock. <em>Not aware of the world?
I am a fool</em>. Before she realized what she was doing, she had
reached out to the pulsing glow she always felt there waiting, to
the True Source. The One Power surged along her veins, charging her
with energy, muting the sheen of Power from the Amyrlin Seat as she
did the same. Moiraine had never before even thought of wielding
the Power against another Aes Sedai. <em>We live in perilous times,
and the world hangs in the balance, and what must be done, must be
done. It must. Oh, Verin, why did you have to put your nose in
where it does not belong?</em></p>

<p>Verin closed her book and slipped it back behind her
belt, then looked from one woman to the other. She could not but be
aware of the nimbus surrounding each of them, the light that came
from touching the True Source. Only someone trained in channeling
herself could see the glow, but there was no chance of any Aes
Sedai missing it in another woman.</p>

<p>A hint of satisfaction settled on Verin&rsquo;s face, but
no sign that she realized she had hurled a lightning bolt. She only
looked as if she had found another piece that fit in a puzzle.
&ldquo;Yes, I thought it must be so. Moiraine could not do this alone,
and who better to help than her girlhood friend who used to sneak
down with her to snitch sweetcakes.&rdquo; She blinked. &ldquo;Forgive me,
Mother. I should not have said that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Verin, Verin.&rdquo; The Amyrlin shook her head
wonderingly. &ldquo;You accuse your sister&mdash;and me?&mdash;of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I won&rsquo;t even say it. And you are worried that you&rsquo;ve spoken too
familiarly to the Amyrlin Seat? You bore a hole in the boat and
worry that it&rsquo;s raining. Think what you are suggesting,
Daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>It is too late for that, Siuan</em>, Moiraine
thought. <em>If we had not panicked and reached for the Source,
perhaps then</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>But she is sure, now</em>. &ldquo;Why are you
telling us this, Verin?&rdquo; she said aloud. &ldquo;If you believe what you
say, you should be telling it to the other sisters, to the Reds in
particular.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verin&rsquo;s eyes widened in surprise. &ldquo;Yes. Yes, I
suppose I should. I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that. But then, if I did, you
would be stilled, Moiraine, and you, Mother, and the man gentled.
No one has ever recorded the progression in a man who wields the
Power. When does the madness come, exactly, and how does it take
him? How quickly does it grow? Can he still function with his body
rotting around him? For how long? Unless he is gentled, what will
happen to the young man, whichever he is, will happen whether or
not I am there to put down the answers. If he is watched and
guided, we should be able to keep some record with reasonable
safety, for a time, at least. And, too, there is <em>The Karaethon
Cycle</em>.&rdquo; She calmly returned their startled looks. &ldquo;I assume,
Mother, that he <em>is</em> the Dragon Reborn? I cannot believe you
would do this&mdash;leave walking free a man who can channel&mdash;unless he was the Dragon.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>She thinks only of the knowledge</em>, Moiraine
thought wonderingly. <em>The culmination of the direst prophecy the
world knows, perhaps the end of the world, and she cares only about
the knowledge. But she is still dangerous, for that</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who else knows of this?&rdquo; The Amyrlin&rsquo;s voice was
faint, but still sharp. &ldquo;Serafelle, I suppose. Who else,
Verin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one, Mother. Serafelle is not really interested
in anything that someone hasn&rsquo;t already set down in a book,
preferably as long ago as possible. She thinks there are enough old
books and manuscripts and fragments scattered about, lost or
forgotten, to equal ten times what we have gathered in Tar Valon.
She feels certain there is enough of the old knowledge still there
to be found for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough, Sister,&rdquo; Moiraine said. She loosed her hold
on the True Source, and after a moment felt the Amyrlin do the
same. It was always a loss to feel the Power draining away, like
blood and life pouring from an open wound. A part of her wanted to
hold on, but unlike some of her sisters, she made it a point of
self-discipline not to grow too fond of the feeling. &ldquo;Sit down,
Verin, and tell us what you know and how you found it out. Leave
out nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Verin took a chair&mdash;with a look to the
Amyrlin for permission to sit in her presence&mdash;Moiraine
watched her sadly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is unlikely,&rdquo; Verin began, &ldquo;that anyone who
hasn&rsquo;t studied the old records thoroughly would notice anything
except that you were behaving oddly. Forgive me, Mother. It was
nearly twenty years ago, with Tar Valon besieged, that I had my
first clue, and that was only&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Light help me, Verin, how I loved you for those
sweetcakes, and for your bosom to weep on. But I will do what I
must do. I will. I must.</em></p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Perrin peered around the corner at the retreating
back of the Aes Sedai. She smelled of lavender soap, though most
would not have scented it even close up. As soon as she turned out
of sight, he hurried for the infirmary door. He had already tried
to see Mat once, and that Aes Sedai&mdash;Leane, he had heard
somebody, call her&mdash;had nearly snapped his head off without
even looking around to see who he was. He felt uneasy around Aes
Sedai, especially if they started looking at his eyes.</p>

<p>Pausing at the door to listen&mdash;he could hear no
footsteps down the corridor either way, and nothing on the other
side of the door&mdash;he went in and closed it softly behind
him.</p>

<p>The infirmary was a long room with white walls, and
the entrances to archers&rsquo; balconies at either end let in lots of
light. Mat was in one of the narrow beds that lined the walls.
After last night, Perrin had expected most of the beds to have men
in them, but in a moment he realized the keep was full of Aes
Sedai. The only thing an Aes Sedai could not cure by Healing was
death. To him, the room smelled of sickness anyway.</p>

<p>Perrin grimaced when he thought of that. Mat lay
still, eyes closed, hands unmoving atop his blankets. He looked
exhausted. Not sick really, but as if he had worked three days in
the fields and only now laid down to rest. He smelled&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;wrong,
though. It was nothing Perrin could put a name to, just wrong.</p>

<p>Perrin sat down carefully on the bed next to Mat&rsquo;s.
He always did things carefully. He was bigger than most people, and
had been bigger than the other boys as long as he could remember.
He had had to be careful so he would not hurt someone accidentally,
or break things. Now it was second nature to him. He liked to think
things through, too, and sometimes talk them over with somebody.
<em>With Rand thinking he&rsquo;s a lord, I can&rsquo;t talk to him, and Mat
certainly isn&rsquo;t going to have much to say.</em></p>

<p>He had gone into one of the gardens the night before,
to think things through. The memory still made him a little
ashamed. If he had not gone, he would have been in his room to go
with Egwene and Mat, and maybe he could have kept them from being
hurt. More likely, he knew, he would be in one of these beds, like
Mat, or dead, but that did not change the way he felt. Still, he
had gone to the garden, and it was nothing to do with the Trolloc
attack that was worrying him now.</p>

<p>Serving women had found him sitting there in the
dark, and one of the Lady Amalisa&rsquo;s attendants, the Lady Timora. As
soon as they came upon him, Timora sent one of the others running,
and he had heard her say, &ldquo;Find Liandrin Sedai! Quickly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had stood there watching him as if they had
thought he might vanish in a puff of smoke like a gleeman. That had
been when the first alarm bell rang, and everybody in the keep
started running.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Liandrin,&rdquo; he muttered now. &ldquo;Red Ajah. About all
they do is hunt for men who channel. You don&rsquo;t think she believes
I&rsquo;m one of those, do you?&rdquo; Mat did not answer, of course. Perrin
rubbed his nose ruefully. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m talking to myself. I don&rsquo;t need
that on top of everything else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat&rsquo;s eyelids fluttered. &ldquo;Who&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Perrin? What
happened?&rdquo; His eyes did not open all the way, and his voice sounded
as if he were still mostly asleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember, Mat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember?&rdquo; Mat sleepily raised a hand toward his
face, then let it fall again with a sigh. His eyes began to drift
shut. &ldquo;Remember Egwene. Asked me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;go down&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;see Fain.&rdquo; He
laughed, and it turned into a yawn. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t ask. Told me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t know what happened after&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He smacked his lips, and
resumed the deep, even breathing of sleep.</p>

<p>Perrin leaped to his feet as his ears caught the
sound of approaching footsteps, but there was nowhere to go. He was
still standing there beside Mat&rsquo;s bed when the door opened and
Leane came in. She stopped, put her fists on her hips, and looked
him slowly up and down. She was nearly as tall as he was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you,&rdquo; she said, in tones quiet yet brisk, &ldquo;are
almost a pretty enough boy to make me wish I was a Green. Almost.
But if you&rsquo;ve disturbed my patient&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well, I dealt with
brothers almost as big as you before I went to the Tower, so you
needn&rsquo;t think those shoulders will help you any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin cleared his throat. Half the time he did not
understand what women meant when they said things. <em>Not like
Rand. He always knows what to say to the girls</em>. He realized he
was scowling and wiped it away. He did not want to think about
Rand, but he certainly did not want to upset an Aes Sedai,
especially one who was beginning to tap her foot impatiently. &ldquo;Ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t disturb him. He&rsquo;s still sleeping. See?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So he is. A good thing for you. Now, what are you
doing in here? I remember chasing you out once; you needn&rsquo;t think I
don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only wanted to know how he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hesitated. &ldquo;He is sleeping is how he is. And in a
few hours, he will get out of that bed, and you&rsquo;ll think there was
never anything wrong with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pause made his hackles rise. She was lying,
somehow. Aes Sedai never lied, but they did not always tell the
truth, either. He was not certain what was going on&mdash;Liandrin
looking for him, Leane lying to him&mdash;but he thought it was
time he got away from Aes Sedai. There was nothing he could do for
Mat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better let him sleep,
then. Excuse me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He tried to slide around her to the door, but
suddenly her hands shot out and grabbed his face, tilting it down
so she could peer into his eyes. Something seemed to pass through
him, a warm ripple that started at the top of his head and went to
his feet, then came back again. He pulled his head out of her
hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re as healthy as a young wild animal,&rdquo; she said,
pursing her lips. &ldquo;But if you were born with those eyes, I am a
Whitecloak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re the only eyes I ever had,&rdquo; he growled. He
felt a little abashed, speaking to an Aes Sedai in that tone, but
he was as surprised as she when he took her gently by the arms and
lifted her to one side, setting her down again out of his way. As
they stared at each other, he wondered if his eyes were as wide
with shock as hers. &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; he said again, and all but
ran.</p>

<p><em>My eyes. My Light-cursed eyes!</em> The morning
sunlight caught his eyes, and they glinted like burnished gold.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Rand twisted on his bed, trying to find a comfortable
position on the thin mattress. Sunlight streamed through the
arrowslits, painting the bare stone walls. He had not slept during
the remainder of the night, and tired as he was, he was sure he
could not sleep now. The leather jerkin lay on the floor between
his bed and the wall, but aside from that he was fully dressed,
even to his new boots. His sword stood propped beside the bed, and
his bow and quiver rested in a corner across the bundled
cloaks.</p>

<p>He could not rid himself of the feeling that he
should take the chance Moiraine had given him and leave
immediately. The urge had been with him all night. Three times he
had risen to go. Twice he had gone as far as opening the door. The
halls had been empty except for a few servants doing late chores;
the way had been clear. But he had to know.</p>

<p>Perrin came in, head down and yawning, and Rand sat
up. &ldquo;How is Egwene? And Mat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s asleep, so they tell me. They wouldn&rsquo;t let me
into the women&rsquo;s apartments to see her. Mat is&mdash;&rdquo; Suddenly
Perrin scowled at the floor. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re so interested, why haven&rsquo;t
you gone to see him yourself? I thought you were not interested in
us anymore. You said you weren&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He pulled open his door of the
wardrobe and began rummaging for a clean shirt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did go to the infirmary, Perrin. There was an Aes
Sedai there, that tall one who&rsquo;s always with the Amyrlin Seat. She
said Mat was asleep, and I was in the way, and I could come back
some other time. She sounded like Master Thane ordering the men at
the mill. You know how Master Thane is, all full of snap and do it
right the first time, and do it right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin did not answer. He just shucked off his coat
and pulled his shirt off over his head.</p>

<p>Rand studied his friend&rsquo;s back for a moment, then dug
up a laugh. &ldquo;You want to hear something? You know what she said to
me? The Aes Sedai in the infirmary, I mean. You saw how tall she
is. As tall as most men. A hand taller, and she could almost look
me in the eyes. Well, she stared me up and down, and then she
muttered, &lsquo;Tall, aren&rsquo;t you? Where were you when I was sixteen? Or
even thirty?&rsquo; And then she laughed, as if it was all a joke. What
do you think of that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin finished tugging on a clean shirt and gave him
a sidelong look. With his burly shoulders and thick curls, he made
Rand think of a hurt bear. A bear that did not understand why had
he been hurt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perrin, I&rsquo;m&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you want to make jokes with Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Perrin
broke in, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s up to you. My Lord.&rdquo; He began stuffing his
shirttail into his breeches. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t spend much time being&mdash;witty; is that the word?&mdash;witty with Aes Sedai. But then, I&rsquo;m
only a clumsy blacksmith, and I might be in somebody&rsquo;s way. My
Lord.&rdquo; Snatching his coat from the floor, he started for the
door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn me, Perrin, I&rsquo;m sorry. I was afraid, and I
thought I was in trouble&mdash;maybe I was; maybe I still am, I
don&rsquo;t know&mdash;and I didn&rsquo;t want you and Mat to be in it with
me. Light, all the women were looking for me last night. I think
that&rsquo;s part of the trouble I&rsquo;m in. I think so. And Liandrin&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He threw up his hands. &ldquo;Perrin, believe me, you don&rsquo;t
want any part of this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin had stopped, but he stood facing the door and
only turned his head enough for Rand to see one golden eye.
&ldquo;Looking for you? Maybe they were looking for all of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, they were looking for me. I wish they hadn&rsquo;t
been, but I know better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin shook his head. &ldquo;Liandrin wanted me, anyway, I
know. I heard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand frowned. &ldquo;Why would she&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? It doesn&rsquo;t change
anything. Look, I opened my mouth and said what I shouldn&rsquo;t. I did
not mean it, Perrin. Now, please, would you tell me about Mat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s asleep. Leane&mdash;that&rsquo;s the Aes Sedai&mdash;said he would be on his feet in a few hours.&rdquo; He shrugged
uncomfortably. &ldquo;I think she was lying. I know Aes Sedai never lie,
not so you can catch them, but she was lying, or keeping something
back.&rdquo; He paused, looking at Rand sideways. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t mean all
that? We will leave here together? You, and me, and Mat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, Perrin. I can&rsquo;t tell you why, but I really
do have to go by myse&mdash;Perrin, wait!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door slammed behind his friend.</p>

<p>Rand fell back on the bed. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; he
muttered. He pounded his fist on the side of the bed. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
<em>But you can go now</em>, a voice said in the back of his head.
<em>Egwene&rsquo;s going to be all right, and Mat will be up and around
in an hour or two. You can go now. Before Moiraine changes her
mind</em>.</p>

<p>He started to sit up when a pounding on the door made
him leap to his feet. If it was Perrin come back, he would not
knock. The pounding came again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan strode in, pushing the door to behind him with
his boot heel. As usual, he wore his sword over a plain coat of
green that was nearly invisible in the woods. This time, though, he
had a wide, golden cord tied high around his left arm, the fringed
ends hanging almost to his elbow. On the knot was pinned a golden
crane in flight, the symbol of Malkier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Amyrlin Seat wants you, sheepherder. You can&rsquo;t
go like that. Out of that shirt and brush your hair. You look like
a haystack.&rdquo; He jerked open the wardrobe and began pawing through
the clothes Rand meant to leave behind.</p>

<p>Rand stood stiff where he was; he felt as though he
had been hit in the head with a hammer. He had expected it, of
course, in a way, but he had been sure he would be gone before the
summons came. <em>She knows. Light, I&rsquo;m sure of it</em>. &ldquo;What do
you mean, she wants me? I&rsquo;m leaving, Lan. You were right. I am
going to the stable right now, get my horse, and leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have done that last night.&rdquo; The Warder
tossed a white silk shirt onto the bed. &ldquo;No one refuses an audience
with the Amyrlin Seat, sheepherder. Not the Lord Captain Commander
of the Whitecloaks himself. Pedron Niall might spend the trip
planning how to kill her, if he could do it and get away, but he
would come.&rdquo; He turned around with one of the high-collared coats
in his hands and held it up. &ldquo;This one will do.&rdquo; Tangled,
long-thorned briars climbed each red sleeve in a thick, gold
embroidered line, and ran around each cuff. Golden herons stood on
the collars, which were edged with gold. &ldquo;The color is right, too.&rdquo;
He seemed to be amused at something, or satisfied. &ldquo;Come on,
sheepherder. Change your shirt. Move.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reluctantly Rand pulled the coarse wool workman&rsquo;s
shirt over his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll feel a fool,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;A silk
shirt! I never wore a silk shirt in my life. And I never wore so
fancy a coat, either, even on a feastday.&rdquo; <em>Light, if Perrin
sees me in that</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Burn me, after all that fool talk
about being a lord, if he sees me in that, he&rsquo;ll never listen to
reason</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go before the Amyrlin Seat dressed like a
groom fresh out of the stables, sheepherder. Let me see your boots.
They&rsquo;ll do. Well, get on with it, get on with it. You don&rsquo;t keep
the Amyrlin waiting. Wear your sword.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My sword!&rdquo; The silk shirt over his head muffled
Rand&rsquo;s yelp. He yanked it the rest of the way on. &ldquo;In the women&rsquo;s
apartments? Lan, if I go for an audience with the Amyrlin Seat&mdash;the Amyrlin Seat!&mdash;wearing a sword, she&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do nothing,&rdquo; Lan cut him off dryly. &ldquo;If the Amyrlin
is afraid of you&mdash;and it&rsquo;s smarter for you to think she
isn&rsquo;t, because I don&rsquo;t know anything that could frighten that woman&mdash;it won&rsquo;t be for a sword. Now remember, you kneel when you go
before her. One knee only, mind,&rdquo; he added sharply. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not
some merchant caught giving short weight. Maybe you had better
practice it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know how, I think. I saw how the Queen&rsquo;s Guards
knelt to Queen Morgase.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ghost of a smile touched the Warder&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;Yes,
you do it just as they did. That will give them something to think
about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand frowned. &ldquo;Why are you telling me this, Lan?
You&rsquo;re a Warder. You&rsquo;re acting as if you are on my side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am on your side, sheepherder. A little. Enough to
help you a bit.&rdquo; The Warder&rsquo;s face was stone, and sympathetic words
sounded strange in that rough voice. &ldquo;What training you&rsquo;ve had, I
gave you, and I&rsquo;ll not have you groveling and sniveling. The Wheel
weaves us all into the Pattern as it wills. You have less freedom
about it than most, but by the Light, you can still face it on your
feet. You remember who the Amyrlin Seat is, sheepherder, and you
show her proper respect, but you do what I tell you, and you look
her in the eye. Well, don&rsquo;t stand there gaping. Tuck in your
shirt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shut his mouth and tucked in his shirt.
<em>Remember who she is? Burn me, what I wouldn&rsquo;t give to forget
who she is!</em></p>

<p>Lan kept up a running flow of instructions while Rand
shrugged into the red coat and buckled on his sword. What to say
and to whom, and what not to say. What to do, and what not. How to
move, even. He was not sure he could remember it all&mdash;most of
it sounded odd, and easy to forget&mdash;and he was sure whatever
he forgot would be just the thing to make the Aes Sedai angry with
him. <em>If they aren&rsquo;t already. If Moiraine told the Amyrlin Seat,
who else did she tell?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Lan, why can&rsquo;t I just leave the way I planned? By
the time she knew I was not coming, I&rsquo;d be a league outside the
walls and galloping.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she&rsquo;d have trackers after you before you had
gone two. What the Amyrlin wants, sheepherder, she gets.&rdquo; He
adjusted Rand&rsquo;s sword belt so the heavy buckle was centered. &ldquo;What
I do is the best I can for you. Believe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why all this? What does it mean? Why do I put my
hand over my heart if the Amyrlin Seat stands up? Why refuse
anything but water&mdash;not that I want to eat a meal with her&mdash;then dribble some on the floor and say &lsquo;The land thirsts&rsquo; ?
And if she asks how old I am, why tell her how long it is since I
was given the sword? I don&rsquo;t understand half of what you&rsquo;ve told
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three drops, sheepherder, don&rsquo;t pour it. You
<em>sprinkle</em> three drops only. You can understand later so
long as you remember now. Think of it as upholding custom. The
Amyrlin will do with you as she must. If you believe you can avoid
it, then you believe you can fly to the moon like Lenn. You can&rsquo;t
escape, but maybe you can hold your own for a while, and perhaps
you can keep your pride, at least. The Light burn me, I am probably
wasting my time, but I&rsquo;ve nothing better to do. Hold still.&rdquo; From
his pocket the Warder produced a long length of wide, fringed
golden cord and tied it around Rand&rsquo;s left arm in a complicated
knot. On the knot he fastened a red-enameled pin, an eagle with its
wings spread. &ldquo;I had that made to give you, and now is as good a
time as any. That will make them think.&rdquo; There was no doubt about
it, now. The Warder was smiling.</p>

<p>Rand looked down at the pin worriedly.
<em>Caldazar</em>. The Red Eagle of Manetheren. &ldquo;A thorn to the
Dark One&rsquo;s foot,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;and a bramble to his hand.&rdquo; He
looked at the Warder. &ldquo;Manetheren&rsquo;s long dead and forgotten, Lan.
It&rsquo;s just a name in a book, now. There is only the Two Rivers.
Whatever else I am, I&rsquo;m a shepherd and a farmer. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the sword that could not be broken was
shattered in the end, sheepherder, but it fought the Shadow to the
last. There is one rule, above all others, for being a man.
Whatever comes, face it on your feet. Now, are you ready? The
Amyrlin Seat waits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a cold knot in the pit of his belly, Rand
followed the Warder into the hall.</p>
