<h4><em>Flight From the White Tower</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">E</span>gwene
and Elayne inclined their heads briefly to
each group of women they passed as they made their way through the
Tower. It was a good thing there were so many women from outside
in the Tower today, Egwene thought, too many for each to have an
Aes Sedai or an Accepted for escort. Alone or in small groups,
garbed richly or poorly, in dress from half a dozen different
lands, some still dusty from their journey to Tar Valon, they kept
to themselves and waited their turn to ask their questions of the
Aes Sedai, or present their petitions. Some women&mdash;ladies or
merchants or merchants&rsquo; wives&mdash;had female servants with them.
Even a few men had come with petitions, standing by themselves,
looking unsure about being in the White Tower, and eyeing everyone
else uneasily.</p>

<p>In the lead, Nynaeve kept her eyes purposefully
ahead, her cloak swirling behind her, walking as if she knew where
they were going&mdash;which she did, as long as no one stopped
them&mdash;and had a perfect right to go there&mdash;which was a
different matter altogether, of course. Dressed now in the clothes
they had brought to Tar Valon, they certainly did not look like
residents of the Tower. Each had chosen her best dress that had a
skirt divided for riding, and cloaks of fine wool rich with
embroidery. As long as they kept away from all who might recognize
them&mdash;they had already dodged several who knew their faces&mdash;Egwene thought they might make it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This would do better for a turn in some lord&rsquo;s park
than a ride to Toman Head,&rdquo; Nynaeve had said dryly as Egwene helped
her with the buttons of a gray silk with thread-of-gold work and
pearled flowers across the bosom and down the sleeves, &ldquo;but it may
allow us to leave unnoticed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Egwene shifted her cloak and smoothed her own
gold-embroidered, green silk dress and glanced at Elayne, in blue
slashed with cream, hoping Nynaeve had been right. So far, everyone
had taken them for petitioners, nobles, or at least women of
wealth, but it seemed that they should stand out. She was surprised
to realize why; she felt uncomfortable in the fine dress after
wearing a novice&rsquo;s plain white for the past few months.</p>

<p>A little cluster of village women in stout, dark
woolens dropped curtsies as they passed. Egwene glanced back at Min
as soon as they were beyond. Min had kept her breeches and baggy
man&rsquo;s shirt under a boy&rsquo;s brown cloak and coat, with an old,
wide-brimmed hat pulled down over her short hair. &ldquo;One of us has to
be the servant,&rdquo; she had said, laughing. &ldquo;Women dressed the way you
are always have at least one. You&rsquo;ll wish you had my breeches if we
have to run.&rdquo; She was burdened with four sets of saddlebags bulging
with warm clothes, for it would surely be winter before they
returned. There were also packets of food pilfered from the
kitchens, enough to last until they could buy more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure I can&rsquo;t carry some of those, Min?&rdquo;
Egwene asked softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re just awkward,&rdquo; Min said with a grin, &ldquo;not
heavy.&rdquo; She seemed to think it was all a game, or else was
pretending to think so. &ldquo;And people would be sure to wonder why a
fine lady such as yourself was carrying her own saddlebags. You can
carry yours&mdash;and mine, too, if you want&mdash;once we&mdash;&rdquo; Her grin vanished, and she whispered fiercely, &ldquo;Aes Sedai!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene whipped her eyes forward. An Aes Sedai with
long, smooth black hair and aged-ivory skin was coming toward them
down the corridor, listening to a woman wearing rough farm clothes
and a patched cloak. The Aes Sedai had not seen them yet, but
Egwene recognized her; Takima, of the Brown Ajah, who taught the
history of the White Tower and Aes Sedai, and who could recognize
one of her pupils at a hundred paces.</p>

<p>Nynaeve turned down a side hall without breaking
stride, but there one of the Accepted, a lanky woman with a
permanent frown, hurried past them hauling a red-faced novice by
the ear.</p>

<p>Egwene had to swallow before she could speak. &ldquo;That
was Irella, and Else. Did they notice us?&rdquo; She could not make
herself look back to see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Min said after a moment. &ldquo;All they saw was our
clothes.&rdquo; Egwene let out a long, relieved breath, and heard one
from Nynaeve, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My heart may burst before we reach the stables,&rdquo;
Elayne murmured. &ldquo;Is this what an adventure is like all the time,
Egwene? Your heart in your mouth, and your stomach in your
feet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose it is,&rdquo; Egwene said slowly. She found it
hard to think that there had been a time when she had been eager to
have an adventure, to do something dangerous and exciting like the
people in stories. Now she thought the exciting part was what you
remembered when you looked back, and the stories left out a good
deal of unpleasantness. She told Elayne as much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; the Daughter-Heir said firmly, &ldquo;I have never
had any real excitement before, and never likely to as long as
Mother has any say in it, which she will until I take the throne
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You two be quiet,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. They were alone in
the hall for a change, with no one in sight in either direction.
She pointed to a narrow flight of stairs going down. &ldquo;That should
be what we want. If I haven&rsquo;t gotten turned around completely, with
all the twists and turns we&rsquo;ve made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She took the stairs as if she were certain anyway,
and the others followed. Surely enough, the small door at the
bottom let out into the dusty yard of the South Stable, where
novices&rsquo; horses were kept, for those who had them, until they had
need of mounts again, which was generally not until they became
Accepted or were sent home. The gleaming bulk of the Tower itself
rose behind them; the Tower grounds spread over a good many hides
of land, with its own walls higher than some city walls.</p>

<p>Nynaeve strode into the stable as if she owned it. It
had a clean smell of hay and horse, and two long rows of stalls ran
back into shadows barred with light from the vents above. For a
wonder, shaggy Bela and Nynaeve&rsquo;s gray mare stood in stalls near
the doors. Bela put her nose over the stall door and whickered
softly to Egwene. There was only one groom in evidence, a
pleasant-looking fellow with gray in his beard, chewing a
straw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will have our horses saddled,&rdquo; Nynaeve told him
in her most commanding tone. &ldquo;Those two. Min, find your horse. and
Elayne&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Min dropped the saddlebags and drew Elayne deeper into
the stables.</p>

<p>The stableman frowned after them and slowly took the
straw from his mouth. &ldquo;There must be some mistake, my Lady. Those
animals&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;are ours,&rdquo; Nynaeve said firmly, folding her
arms so that the Serpent ring was obvious. &ldquo;You will saddle them
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene held her breath; it was a last-ditch plan,
that Nynaeve would try to pass as an Aes Sedai if they had
difficulties with anyone who might actually accept her as one. No
Aes Sedai or Accepted would, of course, and probably not even a
novice, but a stableman&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The man blinked at Nynaeve&rsquo;s ring, then at her. &ldquo;I
was told two,&rdquo; he said at last, sounding unimpressed. &ldquo;One of the
Accepted and a novice. Wasn&rsquo;t nothing said about four of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene felt like laughing. Of course Liandrin would
not have believed them able to get their horses by themselves.</p>

<p>Nynaeve looked disappointed, and her voice sharpened.
&ldquo;You trot those horses out and saddle them, or you&rsquo;ll have need of
Liandrin&rsquo;s Healing, if she will give it to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The groom mouthed Liandrin&rsquo;s name, but one look at
Nynaeve&rsquo;s face and he saw to the horses with no more than a mutter
or two, not loud enough for any but himself to hear. Min and Elayne
came back with their own mounts just as he finished tightening the
second girth. Min&rsquo;s was a tall dust-colored gelding, Elayne&rsquo;s a bay
mare with an arched neck.</p>

<p>When they were mounted, Nynaeve addressed herself to
the stableman again. &ldquo;No doubt you were told to keep this quiet,
and that hasn&rsquo;t changed whether we are two or two hundred. If you
think it has, think about what Liandrin will do if you talk what
you were told to keep quiet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As they were riding out, Elayne tossed him a coin and
murmured, &ldquo;For your trouble, goodman. You have done well.&rdquo; Outside,
she caught Egwene&rsquo;s eye and smiled. &ldquo;Mother says a stick and honey
always work better than a stick alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope we don&rsquo;t need either with the guards,&rdquo; Egwene
said. &ldquo;I hope Liandrin spoke to them, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At Tarlomen&rsquo;s Gate, though, piercing the tall south
wall of the Tower grounds, there was no telling if anyone had
spoken to the guards or not. They waved the four women through with
no more than a glance and a cursory bow. Guards were meant to keep
out those who were dangerous; apparently these had no orders about
keeping anyone in.</p>

<p>A cool river breeze gave them an excuse to pull up
the hoods of their cloaks as they rode slowly through the streets
of the city. The ring of their horses&rsquo; hooves on the paving stones
was lost in the murmur of the crowds filling the streets and the
music that came from some of the buildings they passed. People
dressed in garments from every land, from the dark and somber mode
of Cairhien to the bright, brilliant colors of the Traveling
People, and every style in between, split around the horsewomen
like a river around a rock, but they still could not move at more
than a slow walk.</p>

<p>Egwene gave no attention to the fabulous towers with
their sky-borne bridges or the buildings that looked more like
breaking waves, or windsculpted cliffs, or fanciful shells, than
anything made from stone. Aes Sedai often went into the city, and
in that crowd they could come face-to-face with one before they
knew it. After a time she realized the other women were keeping as
close a watch as she, but she still felt more than a glimmer of
relief when the Ogier grove came into view.</p>

<p>The Great Trees were now visible beyond the rooftops,
their spreading tops a hundred spans and more in the air. Towering
oaks and elms, leatherleafs and firs, were dwarfed beneath them. A
wall of sorts encompassed the grove, which was a good two miles
across, but it was only an endless series of spiraling stone
arches, each five spans high and twice as wide. By the outer side
of the wall, carriages, carts, and people bustled along a street,
while inside lay a wilderness of sorts. The grove had neither the
tame look of a park nor the complete haphazardness of the forest
depths. Rather, it seemed to be the ideal of nature, as if this
were the perfect woods, the most beautiful forest that could be.
Some of the leaves had already begun to turn, and even the small
swathes of orange and yellow and red among the green seemed to
Egwene to be exactly the way autumn foliage should look.</p>

<p>A few people strolled just inside the open arches,
and no one looked twice when the four women rode in under the
trees. The city was quickly lost to view, even the sounds of it
softened, then blocked, by the grove. In the space of ten strides
they seemed to be miles from the nearest town.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The north edge of the grove, she said,&rdquo; Nynaeve
muttered, peering around. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any point of it further
north than&mdash;&rdquo; She cut off as two horses burst from a copse of
black elder, a dark, glossy mare with a rider and a lightly laden
packhorse.</p>

<p>The dark mare reared, pawing the air, as Liandrin
reined her harshly. The Aes Sedai&rsquo;s face wore fury like a mask. &ldquo;I
told you not to tell anyone of this! Not anyone!&rdquo; Egwene noticed
pole-lanterns on the packhorse, and thought it odd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are friends,&rdquo; Nynaeve began, her back
stiffening, but Elayne broke in on her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive us, Liandrin Sedai. They did not tell us; we
overheard. We did not mean to listen to anything we should not
have, but we did overhear. And we want to help Rand al&rsquo;Thor, too.
And the other boys, of course,&rdquo; she added quickly.</p>

<p>Liandrin peered at Elayne and Min. The late afternoon
sunlight, slanting through the branches, shadowed their faces
beneath the hoods of their cloaks. &ldquo;So,&rdquo; she said finally, still
watching those two. &ldquo;I had made arrangements for you to be taken
care of, but as you are here, you are here. Four can make this
journey as well as two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Taken care of, Liandrin Sedai?&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;I do
not understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Child, you and that other are known as friends of
these two. Do you not think there are those who would question you
when they are found to be gone? Do you believe the Black Ajah would
be gentle with you just because you are heir to a throne? Had you
remained in the White Tower, you might not have lived the night.&rdquo;
That silenced them all for a moment, but Liandrin wheeled her horse
and called, &ldquo;Follow me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai led them deeper into the grove, until
they came to a tall fence of stout ironwork topped with a hedge of
razor-sharp spikes. Curving slightly, as if it enclosed a large
area, the fence ran out of sight among the trees to left and right.
There was a gate in the fence, secured with a big lock. Liandrin
unfastened this with a large key she produced from her cloak,
motioned them through, then relocked it behind them and rode on
ahead immediately. A squirrel chittered at them from a branch
overhead, and from somewhere came the sharp drumming of a
woodpecker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo; Nynaeve demanded. Liandrin did
not answer, and Nynaeve looked angrily at the others. &ldquo;Why are we
just riding deeper into these woods? We have to cross a bridge, or
else take ship, if we&rsquo;re going to leave Tar Valon, and there isn&rsquo;t
any bridge or ship in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is this,&rdquo; Liandrin announced. &ldquo;The fence, it
keeps away those who might harm themselves, but we have a need this
day.&rdquo; What she gestured to was a tall, thick slab of what seemed to
be stone, standing on edge, one side carved intricately in vines
and leaves.</p>

<p>Egwene&rsquo;s throat tightened; suddenly she knew why
Liandrin had brought lanterns, and she did not like what she knew.
She heard Nynaeve whisper, &ldquo;A Waygate.&rdquo; They both remembered the
Ways all too well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We did it once,&rdquo; she told herself as much as
Nynaeve. &ldquo;We can do it again.&rdquo; <em>If Rand and the others need us,
we have to help them. That&rsquo;s all there is to it</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that really&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; Min began in a choked voice
and could not finish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Waygate,&rdquo; Elayne breathed. &ldquo;I did not think the
Ways could be used any longer. At least, I did not think their use
was allowed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Liandrin had already dismounted and plucked the
trefoil <em>Avendesora</em> leaf out of the carving; like two huge
doors woven of living vines, the gates were swinging open,
revealing what appeared to be a dull, silvery mirror that gave
their reflections back dimly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not have to come,&rdquo; Liandrin said. &ldquo;You can
wait here for me, safely enclosed by the fence until I come for
you. Or perhaps the Black Ajah will find you before anyone else.&rdquo;
Her smile was not pleasant. Behind her, the Waygate came open to
its fullest and stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not say I wouldn&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; Elayne said, but she
gave the shadowed woods a lingering look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we are going to do this,&rdquo; Min said hoarsely,
&ldquo;then let&rsquo;s do it.&rdquo; She was staring at the Waygate, and Egwene
thought she heard her mutter, &ldquo;The Light burn you, Rand
al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must go last,&rdquo; Liandrin said. &ldquo;All of you, in. I
will follow.&rdquo; She was eyeing the woods now, too, as if she thought
someone might be following them. &ldquo;Quickly! Quickly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene did not know what Liandrin expected to see,
but if anyone at all came they would probably stop them from using
the Waygate. <em>Rand, you wool-headed idiot, she thought, why
can&rsquo;t you just once get yourself into some kind of trouble that
doesn&rsquo;t force me to act like the heroine in a story?</em></p>

<p>She dug her heels into Bela&rsquo;s flanks, and the shaggy
mare, restive from too much time in a stable, leaped forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slowly!&rdquo; Nynaeve shouted, but it was too late.</p>

<p>Egwene and Bela surged toward their own dull
reflections; two shaggy horses touched noses, appeared to flow into
each other. Then Egwene was merging into her own image with an icy
shock. Time seemed to stretch out, as if the cold crept over her by
the width of one hair at a time, and every hair took minutes.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bela was stumbling in pitch-blackness,
moving so fast the mare almost pitched over on her head. She caught
herself and stood trembling as Egwene dismounted hurriedly, feeling
the mare&rsquo;s legs in the dark to see if she had been hurt. She was
almost glad of the dark, to hide her crimson face. She knew that
time as well as distance were different the other side of a
Waygate; she had moved before thinking.</p>

<p>There was only the blackness around her in every
direction, except for the rectangle of the open Waygate, like a
window of smoked glass when seen from this side. It let no light in&mdash;the black seemed to press right up against it&mdash;but
through it Egwene could see the others, moving by the slowest
increments, like figures in a nightmare. Nynaeve was insisting on
handing around the pole-lanterns and lighting them; Liandrin was
acceding with a bad grace, apparently insisting on speed.</p>

<p>When Nynaeve came though the Waygate&mdash;leading
her gray mare slowly, ever so slowly&mdash;Egwene almost ran to
hug her, and at least half of her feeling was for the lantern
Nynaeve carried. The lantern made a smaller pool of light than it
should have&mdash;the darkness pressed against the light, trying
to force it back into the lantern&mdash;but Egwene had begun to
feel that darkness pressing against her, as if it had weight.
Instead, she contented herself with saying, &ldquo;Bela&rsquo;s all right, and
I did not break my neck the way I deserved to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once there had been light along the Ways, before the
taint on the Power with which they had first been made, the taint
of the Dark One on <em>saidin</em>, had begun to corrupt them.</p>

<p>Nynaeve thrust the pole of the lantern into her hands
and turned to pull another from under her saddle girth. &ldquo;As long as
you know you deserved to,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;then you didn&rsquo;t deserve
to.&rdquo; Suddenly she chuckled. &ldquo;Sometimes I think it was sayings like
that more than anything else that created the title of Wisdom.
Well, here&rsquo;s another. You break your neck, and I&rsquo;ll see it mended
just so I can break it again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was said lightly, and Egwene found herself
laughing, too&mdash;until she recalled where she was. Nynaeve&rsquo;s
amusement did not last long either.</p>

<p>Min and Elayne came though the Waygate hesitantly,
leading their horses and carrying lanterns, obviously expecting to
find monsters waiting at the least. They looked relieved, at first,
to find nothing but darkness, but the oppressiveness of it soon had
them shifting nervously from foot to foot. Liandrin replaced the
<em>Avendesora</em> leaf and rode through the closing Waygate leading the
packhorse.</p>

<p>Liandrin did not wait for the gate to finish closing,
but tossed the lead line of the packhorse to Min without a word and
started along a white line, dimly made out by the light of her
lantern, leading into the Ways. The floor seemed to be stone, eaten
and pitted by acid. Egwene scrambled hurriedly onto Bela&rsquo;s back,
but she was no quicker to follow the Aes Sedai than anyone else.
There seemed to be nothing in the world except the rough floor
under the horses&rsquo; hooves.</p>

<p>Straight as an arrow the white line led through the
dark to a large stone slab covered with Ogier script inlaid in
silver. The same pocking that marked the floor also broke the
script in places.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Guiding,&rdquo; Elayne murmured, twisting in her saddle
to look around uneasily. &ldquo;Elaida taught me a little about the Ways.
She would not say much. Not enough,&rdquo; she added glumly. &ldquo;Or maybe
too much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Calmly Liandrin compared the Guiding with a
parchment, then stuffed it back into a pocket of her cloak before
Egwene could get a look.</p>

<p>Their lanterns&rsquo; light stopped abruptly rather than
fading out at the edges, but it was enough for Egwene to see a
thick stone balustrade, eaten away in places, as the Aes Sedai led
them away from the Guiding. An Island, Elayne called it; the
darkness made judging the Island&rsquo;s size difficult, but Egwene
thought it might be a hundred paces across.</p>

<p>Stone bridges and ramps pierced the balustrade, each
with a stone post beside it marked with a single line in Ogier
script. The bridges seemed to arch out into nothing. The ramps led
up or down. It was impossible to see more than the beginning of any
of them, as they rode past.</p>

<p>Pausing only to eye the stone posts, Liandrin took a
ramp that led down, and quickly there was nothing but the ramp and
the darkness. A dampening silence hung over everything; Egwene had
the feeling that even the clatter of the horses&rsquo; hooves on the
rough stone did not travel very far beyond the light.</p>

<p>Down and down the ramp ran, curving back on itself,
until it reached another Island, with its broken balustrade between
bridges and ramps, its Guiding that Liandrin compared with her
parchment. The Island seemed like solid stone, just as the first
one had. Egwene wished she was not sure that the first Island was
directly over their heads.</p>

<p>Nynaeve spoke up suddenly, voicing Egwene&rsquo;s thoughts.
Her voice sounded steady, but she paused to swallow in the middle
of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it might be,&rdquo; Elayne said faintly. Her
eyes rolled upwards, and quickly dropped again. &ldquo;Elaida says the
rules of nature do not hold in the Ways. At least, not the way they
do outside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light!&rdquo; Min muttered, then raised her voice. &ldquo;How
long do you mean us to stay in here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai&rsquo;s honey-colored braids swung as she
turned to regard them. &ldquo;Until I take you out,&rdquo; she said flatly.
&ldquo;The more you bother me, the longer that will be.&rdquo; She bent back to
studying the parchment and the Guiding.</p>

<p>Egwene and the others fell silent.</p>

<p>Liandrin pushed on from Guiding to Guiding, by ramps
and bridges that seemed to run unsupported through the endless
dark. The Aes Sedai paid very little heed to the rest of them, and
Egwene found herself wondering whether Liandrin would turn back to
search if one of them fell behind. The others perhaps had the same
thought, for they all rode bunched tightly on the dark mare&rsquo;s
heels.</p>

<p>Egwene was surprised to realize that she still felt
the attraction of <em>saidar</em>, both the presence of the female
half of the True Source and the desire to touch it, to channel its
flow. Somehow, she had thought the Shadow&rsquo;s taint on the Ways would
hide it from her. She could sense that taint, after a fashion. It
was faint and had nothing to do with <em>saidar</em>, but she was
sure that reaching for the True Source here would be like baring
her arm to foul, greasy smoke in order to reach a clean cup.
Whatever she did would be tainted. For the first time in weeks she
had no trouble at all in resisting the attraction of <em>
saidar</em>.</p>

<p>It was well into what would have been night in the
world outside the Ways when, on an Island, Liandrin abruptly
dismounted and announced that they would halt for supper and sleep,
and that there was food on the packhorse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Parcel it out,&rdquo; she said, not bothering to assign
the task. &ldquo;It will take us the better part of two days to reach
Toman Head. I would not have you arrive hungry if you were too
foolish to bring food yourselves.&rdquo; Briskly she unsaddled and
hobbled her mare, but then she sat down on her saddle and waited
for one of them to bring her something to eat.</p>

<p>Elayne took Liandrin her flatbread and cheese. The
Aes Sedai made it obvious that she did not want their company, so
the rest of them ate their bread and cheese a little apart from
her, sitting on their saddles drawn close together. The darkness
beyond their lanterns made a poor sauce.</p>

<p>After a time, Egwene said, &ldquo;Liandrin Sedai, what if
we encounter the Black Wind?&rdquo; Min mouthed the word questioningly,
but Elayne gave a squeak. &ldquo;Moiraine Sedai said it could not be
killed, or even hurt very much, and I can feel the taint on this
place waiting to twist anything we do with the Power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will not so much as think of the Source unless I
tell you to,&rdquo; Liandrin said sharply. &ldquo;Why, if one such as you tried
to channel here, in the Ways, you might well go as mad as a man.
You have not the training to deal with the taint of those men who
made this. If the Black Wind appears, I will deal with it.&rdquo; She
pursed her lips, studying a lump of white cheese. &ldquo;Moiraine does
not know so much as she thinks.&rdquo; She popped the cheese into her
mouth with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not like her,&rdquo; Egwene muttered, low enough to
make sure the Aes Sedai could not hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Moiraine can work with her,&rdquo; Nynaeve said
quietly, &ldquo;so can we. Not that I like Moiraine any better than I do
Liandrin, but if they&rsquo;re meddling with Rand and the others again&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She fell silent, hitching her cloak up. The darkness was not
cold, but it seemed as if it should be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this Black Wind?&rdquo; Min asked. When Elayne had
explained, with a great deal of what Elaida had said and what her
mother had said, Min sighed. &ldquo;The Pattern has a great deal to
answer for. I don&rsquo;t know that any man is worth this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not have to come,&rdquo; Egwene reminded her. &ldquo;You
could have gone at any time. No one would have tried to stop you
leaving the Tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I could have wandered off,&rdquo; Min said wryly. &ldquo;As
easily as you, or Elayne. The Pattern doesn&rsquo;t much care what we
want, Egwene, what if, after all you are going through for him,
Rand doesn&rsquo;t marry you? What if he marries some woman you&rsquo;ve never
seen before, or Elayne, or me? What then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne chortled. &ldquo;Mother would never approve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene was silent for a time. Rand might not live to
marry anyone. And if he did&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She could not imagine Rand
hurting anyone. <em>Not even after he&rsquo;s gone mad?</em> There had to
be some way to stop that, some way to change it; Aes Sedai knew so
much, could do so much. <em>If they could stop it, why don&rsquo;t
they?</em> The only answer was because they could not, and that was
not the one she wanted.</p>

<p>She tried to put lightness in her voice. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
suppose I will marry him. Aes Sedai seldom do marry, you know. But
I would not set my heart on him if were you. Or you, Elayne. I do
not think&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Her voice caught, and she coughed to cover it. &ldquo;I
do not think he will ever marry. But if he does, I wish well to
whoever ends up with him, even one of you.&rdquo; She thought she sounded
as if she meant it. &ldquo;He is stubborn as a mule, and wrongheaded to a
fault, but he <em>is</em> gentle.&rdquo; Her voice shook, but she managed
to turn the quaver into a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;However much you say you do not care,&rdquo; Elayne said,
&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d approve less than Mother would. He is interesting,
Egwene. More interesting than any man I&rsquo;ve ever met, even if he is
a shepherd. If you are silly enough to throw him away, you will
have only yourself to blame if I decide to face down you and Mother
both. It would not be the first time the Prince of Andor had no
title before he wed. But you won&rsquo;t be that silly, so don&rsquo;t try to
pretend you will. No doubt you will choose the Green Ajah, and make
him one of your Warders. The only Greens I know with only one
Warder are married to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene made herself go along with it, saying if she
did become a Green she would have ten Warders.</p>

<p>Min watched her, frowning, and Nynaeve watched Min
thoughtfully. They all fell silent by the time they changed into
more suitable clothes for traveling from their saddlebags. It was
not easy, keeping spirits up in that place.</p>

<p>Sleep came slowly to Egwene, fitfully, and it was
filled with bad dreams. She did not dream of Rand, but of the man
whose eyes were fire. His face was not masked this time, and it was
horrible with almost healed burns. He only looked at her and
laughed, but that was worse than the dreams that followed, the
dreams of being lost in the Ways forever, the ones where the Black
Wind was chasing her. She was grateful when the toe of Liandrin&rsquo;s
riding boot dug into her ribs to waken her; she felt as if she had
not slept at all.</p>

<p>Liandrin pushed them hard through the next day, or
what passed for day, with only their lanterns for a sun, not
letting them stop for sleep until they were swaying in their
saddles. Stone made a hard bed, but Liandrin roused them
ruthlessly after a few hours, hardly waiting for them to mount
before riding on. Ramps and bridges, Islands and Guidings, Egwene
saw so many of them in that pitch-dark that she lost count. She had
long since lost any count of hours or of days. Liandrin allowed
only brief halts to eat and rest the horses, and the darkness
weighed down on their shoulders. They slumped in their saddles like
sacks of grain, except for Liandrin. The Aes Sedai seemed
unaffected by tiredness, or the dark. She was as fresh as she had
been back in the White Tower, and as cold. She would not let anyone
glimpse the parchment she compared to the Guidings, stuffing it
away with a curt, &ldquo;It is nothing you would understand,&rdquo; when
Nynaeve asked.</p>

<p>And then, while Egwene blinked wearily, Liandrin was
riding away from a Guiding, not toward another bridge or ramp, but
down a pitted white line that led off into the darkness. Egwene
stared at her friends, and then they all hurried to follow. Ahead,
by the light of her lantern, the Aes Sedai was already removing the
<em>Avendesora</em> leaf from the carvings on a Waygate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are here,&rdquo; Liandrin said, smiling. &ldquo;I have
brought you at last to where you must go.&rdquo;</p>
