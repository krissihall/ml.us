<p class="drop"><em>A NOTE ON DATES IN THIS GLOSSARY.</em> Three systems
of recording dates have been in general use since the Breaking of
the World. The first recorded years After the Breaking (AB). Since
the years of the Breaking and immediately after were years of
almost total chaos, and since this calendar was adopted a good
hundred years after the end of the Breaking, its starting point was
arbitrarily assigned. At the end of the Trolloc Wars many records
had been lost, so much so that there was argument about the exact
year under the old system. A new calendar was therefore
established, dating from the end of the Wars and celebrating the
supposed freedom of the world from the Trolloc threat. This second
calendar recorded each year as Free Year (FY). After the
disruption, death, and destruction caused by the War of the Hundred
Years, a third calendar came into being. This calendar, of the New
Era (NE), is currently in use.</p>

<br>

<dl>
<dt><strong><em>a&rsquo;dam</em></strong> (<em>AYE-dam</em>):</dt>

<dd>A device, consisting of a collar and a bracelet linked by a
silvery metal leash, that may be used to control, against her will,
any woman who can channel. The collar is worn by the
<em>damane</em>, the bracelet by the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>.
<em><strong>See also</strong></em> <em>damane</em>;
<em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>.</dd>

<dt><strong><em>Aes Sedai</em></strong> (<em>EYEZ
seh-DEYE</em>):</dt>

<dd>Wielders of the One Power. Since the Time of Madness, all
surviving Aes Sedai are women. Widely distrusted and feared, even
hated, they are blamed by many for the Breaking of the World, and
are thought to meddle in the affairs of nations. At the same time,
few rulers will be without an Aes Sedai adviser, even in lands
where the existence of such a connection must be kept secret.
<em><strong>See also</strong></em> Ajah; Amyrlin Seat; Time of
Madness.</dd>


<dt><strong><em>Agelmar; Lord Agelmar of House Jagad</em></strong>
(<em>AGH-el-mar; JAH-gad</em>):</dt>

<dd>Lord of Fal Dara. His sign is three running red foxes.</dd>


<dt><strong><em>Age of Legends</em></strong>:</dt>

<dd>The Age ended by the War of the Shadow and the Breaking of the
World. A time when Aes Sedai performed wonders now only dreamed of.
<em><strong>See also</strong></em> Wheel of Time; Breaking of the
World; War of the Shadow.</dd>


<dt><strong><em>Aiel</em></strong> (<em>eye-EEL</em>):</dt>

<dd>The people of the Aiel Waste. Fierce and hardy. Also called
Aielmen. They veil their faces before they kill, giving rise to the
saying &ldquo;acting like a black-veiled Aiel&rdquo; to describe someone who is
being violent. Deadly warriors with weapons or with nothing but
their bare hands, they will not touch a sword. Their pipers play
them into battle with the music of dances, and Aielmen call battle
&ldquo;the Dance.&rdquo; <em><strong>See also</strong></em> Aiel warrior
societies; Aiel Waste.</dd>


<dt><strong><em>Aiel warrior societies</em></strong>:</dt>

<dd>Aiel warriors are all members of one of the warrior societies,
such as the Stone Dogs, the Red Shields, or the Maidens of the
Spear. Each society has its own customs, and sometimes specific
duties. For example, Red Shields act as police. Stone Dogs often
vow not to retreat once battle has been joined, and will die to the
last man if necessary to fulfill this vow. The clans of the Aiel
frequently fight among themselves, but members of the same society
will not fight one another even if their clans are doing so. In
this way, there are always lines of contact between the clans even
when they are in open warfare. <em><strong>See also</strong></em>
Aiel; Aiel Waste; <em>Far Dareis Mai</em>.</dd>


<dt><strong><em>Aiel Waste</em></strong>:</dt>

<dd>The harsh, rugged, and all-but-waterless land east of the Spine
of the World. Few outsiders venture there, not only because water
is almost impossible to find for one not born there, but because
the Aiel consider themselves at war with all other peoples and do
not welcome strangers.</dd>


<dt><strong><em>Ajah</em></strong> (<em>AH-jah</em>):</dt>

<dd>Societies among the Aes Sedai to which all Aes Sedai except the
Amyrlin Seat belong. They are designated by colors: Blue, Red,
White, Green, Brown, Yellow, and Gray. Each follows a specific
philosophy of the use of the One Power and the purposes of the Aes
Sedai. For example, the Red Ajah bends all its energies to finding
men who are attempting to wield the Power and to gentling them. The
Brown Ajah, on the other hand, forsakes involvement with the
mundane world and dedicates itself to seeking knowledge. There are
rumors (hotly denied, and never safely mentioned in front of any
Aes Sedai) of a Black Ajah, dedicated to serving the Dark One.</dd>

the face of the earth. They caused great earthquakes, leveled old
mountain ranges and raised new mountains, lifted dry land where
seas had been and made the ocean rush in where dry land had been.
Many parts of the world were completely depopulated, and the
survivors were scattered like dust on the wind. This destruction is

Founded during the War of the Hundred Years by Lothair Mantelar
(<em>LOH-thayr MAHN-tee-LAHR</em>) to proselytize against the
increasing numbers of Darkfriends, they evolved during the war into
a completely military organization, extremely rigid in their
beliefs, and completely certain that only they know the truth and

<dt><strong><em>Dai Shan</em></strong> (<em>DYE SHAN</em>):</dt>

<dd>A title in the Borderlands meaning Diademed Battle Lord.
<em><strong>See also</strong></em> Borderlands.</dd>


<dt><strong><em>damane</em></strong> (<em>dah-MAHN-ee</em>):</dt>

<dd>Most common name, used in every land, for Shai&rsquo;tan. The source
of evil, antithesis of the Creator. Imprisoned by the Creator at
the moment of Creation in a prison at Shayol Ghul. An attempt to
free him from that prison brought about the War of the Shadow, the
tainting of <em>saidin</em>, the Breaking of the World, and the end
of the Age of Legends.</dd>


<dt><strong><em>Dark One, naming the</em></strong>:</dt>

<dd>Saying the true name of the Dark One (Shai&rsquo;tan) draws his
attention, inevitably bringing ill fortune at best, disaster at
worst. For that reason, many euphemisms are used, among them the
Dark One, Father of Lies, Sightblinder, Lord of the Grave, Shepherd
of the Night, Heartsbane, Heartfang, Grassburner, and Leafblighter.
Someone who seems to be inviting ill fortune is often said to be
&ldquo;naming the Dark One.&rdquo;</dd>

stock. A Draghkar appears to be a large man with bat-like wings,
whose skin is too pale and whose eyes are too large. The Draghkar&rsquo;s
song can draw its prey to it, suppressing the victim&rsquo;s will. There
is a saying: &ldquo;The kiss of the Draghkar is death.&rdquo; It does not bite,
but its kiss will consume first the soul of its victim, and then
its life.</dd>


<dt><strong><em>Dragon, false</em></strong>:</dt>

<dd>Occasionally men claim to be the Dragon Reborn, and sometimes
one of them gains following enough to require an army to put it
down. Some have begun wars that involved many nations. Over the
centuries most of these have been men unable to channel the One
Power, but a few could do so. All, however, either disappeared or
were captured or killed without fulfilling any of the Prophecies
concerning the Rebirth of the Dragon. These men are called false
Dragons. Among those who could channel, the most powerful were
Raolin Darksbane (335-36AB), Yurian Stonebow (circa 1300-1308 AB),
Davian (FY 351), Guaire Amalasan (FY 939-43), and Logain (997 NE).
<em><strong>See also</strong></em> Dragon Reborn.</dd>


<dt><strong><em>Dragon, Prophecies of the</em></strong>:</dt>

<dd>Little known and seldom spoken of, the Prophecies, given in
<em>The Karaethon Cycle</em>, foretell that the Dark One will be
freed again to touch the world. And that Lews Therin Telamon, the
Dragon, Breaker of the World, will be reborn to fight Tarmon
Gai&rsquo;don, the Last Battle against the Shadow. <em><strong>See
also</strong></em> Dragon, the.</dd>


<dt><strong><em>Dragon, the</em></strong>:</dt>

<dd>The name by which Lews Therin Telamon was known during the War
of the Shadow. In the madness that overtook all male Aes Sedai,
Lews Therin killed every living person who carried any of his
blood, as well as everyone he loved, thus earning the name
Kinslayer. <em><strong>See also</strong></em> Dragon Reborn;
Dragon, Prophecies of the.</dd>


<dt><strong><em>Dragon Reborn</em></strong>:</dt>

<dd>According to prophecy and legend the Dragon will be born again
at mankind&rsquo;s greatest hour of need to save the world. This is not
something people look forward to, both because the Prophecies say
the Dragon Reborn will bring a new Breaking to the world and
because Lews Therin Kinslayer, the Dragon, is a name to make men
shudder, even more than three thousand years after his death.
<em><strong>See also</strong></em> Dragon, the; Dragon, false;
Dragon, Prophecies of the.</dd>


<dt><strong><em>Dragon&rsquo;s Fang, the</em></strong>:</dt>

<dd>A stylized mark in the shape of a teardrop balanced on its
point. Scrawled on a door or a house, it is an accusation of evil
against the people inside, or an attempt to bring the Dark One&rsquo;s
attention, and thus harm, to them.</dd>


<dt><strong><em>Dreadlords</em></strong>:</dt>

<dd>Those men and women who, able to channel the One Power, went
over to the Shadow during the Trolloc Wars, acting as commanders of
the Trolloc forces.</dd>

also</strong></em> Foretelling.</dd>

<dd>Queen Morgase&rsquo;s daughter, the Daughter-Heir to the Throne of
Andor. Her sign is a golden lily.</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>

<dt><strong><em>Fain, Padan</em></strong> (<em>FAIN,
PAHD-ahn</em>):</dt>

<dd>A man imprisoned as a Darkfriend in Fal Dara keep.</dd>


<dt><strong><em>Far Dareis Mai</em></strong> (<em>FAHR DAH-rize
MY</em>):</dt>

<dd>Literally &ldquo;Maidens of the Spear.&rdquo; A warrior society of the
Aiel, which, unlike any of the others, admits women and only women.
A Maiden may not marry and remain in the society, nor may she fight
while carrying a child. Any child born to a Maiden is given to
another woman to raise, in such a way that no one knows who the
child&rsquo;s mother was. (&ldquo;You may belong to no man, nor may any man
belong to you, nor any child. The spear is your lover, your child,
and your life.&rdquo;) These children are treasured, for it is prophesied
that a child born of a Maiden will unite the clans and return the
Aiel to the greatness they knew during the Age of Legends.
<em><strong>See also</strong></em> Aiel; Aiel warrior
societies.</dd>


<dt><strong><em>Five Powers, the</em></strong>:</dt>

<dd>There are threads to the One Power, and each person who can
channel can usually grasp some threads better than others. These
threads are named according to the sorts of things that can be done
using them&mdash;Earth, Air, Fire, Water, and Spirit&mdash;and
are called the Five Powers. Any wielder of the Power will have a
greater degree of strength with one, or possibly two, of these, and
lesser strength in the others. Some few may have great strength
with three, but since the Age of Legends no one has had great
strength with all five. Even then this was extremely rare. The
degree of strength can vary greatly between individuals, so that
some who can channel are much stronger than others. Performing
certain acts with the One Power requires ability in one or more of
the Five Powers. For example, starting or controlling a fire
requires Fire, and affecting the weather requires Air and Water,
while Healing requires Water and Spirit. While Spirit was found
equally in men and in women, great ability with Earth and/or Fire
was found much more often among men; with Water and/or Air among
women. There were exceptions, but it was so often so that Earth and
Fire came to be regarded as male Powers, Air and Water as female.
Generally, no ability is considered stronger than any other, though
there is a saying among Aes Sedai: &ldquo;There is no rock so strong that
water and wind cannot wear it away, no fire so fierce that water
cannot quench it or wind snuff it out.&rdquo; It should be noted this
saying came into use long after the last male Aes Sedai was dead.
Any equivalent saying among male Aes Sedai is long lost.</dd>


<dt><strong><em>Flame of Tar Valon</em></strong>:</dt>

<dd>The symbol of Tar Valon, the Amyrlin Seat, and the Aes Sedai. A
stylized representation of a flame; a white teardrop with the point
upward.</dd>


<dt><strong><em>Forsaken, the</em></strong>:</dt>

<dd>Name given to thirteen of the most powerful Aes Sedai ever
known, who went over to the Dark One during the War of the Shadow
in return for the promise of immortality. According to both legend
and fragmentary records, they were imprisoned along with the Dark
One when his prison was resealed. Their names are still used to
frighten children.</dd>

<dt>&nbsp;</dt>

<dt><strong><em>Gawyn</em></strong> (<em>GAH-wihn</em>):</dt>

<dd>Queen Morgase&rsquo;s son, and Elayne&rsquo;s brother. His sign is a white
boar.</dd>


<dt><strong><em>gentling</em></strong>:</dt>

<dd>The act, performed by Aes Sedai, of shutting off a male who can
channel from the One Power. This is necessary because any man who
learns to channel will go insane from the taint on <em>saidin</em>
and will almost certainly do horrible things with the Power in his
madness. A man who has been gentled can still sense the True
Source, but he cannot touch it. Whatever madness has come before
gentling is arrested by the act of gentling, but not cured by it,
and if it is done soon enough death can be averted. <em><strong>See
also</strong></em> One Power, the; stilling.</dd>


<dt><strong><em>gleeman</em></strong>:</dt>

<dd>A traveling storyteller, musician, juggler, tumbler, and

A haunt of Trollocs, Myrddraal, and other creatures of the
Shadow.</dd>

<dd>A cycle of stories concerning the legendary search for the Horn

beginning of the War of the Hundred Years. If told in its entirety,
the cycle would take many days.</dd>


<dt><strong><em>Great Lord of the Dark</em></strong>:</dt>

<dd>The name by which Darkfriends refer to the Dark One, claiming
that to use his true name would be blasphemous.</dd>


<dt><strong><em>Great Serpent</em></strong>:</dt>

Legends began, consisting of a serpent eating its own tail. A ring

<dt><strong><em>One Power, the</em></strong>:</dt>

<dd>The power drawn from the True Source. The vast majority of
people are completely unable to learn to channel the One Power. A
very small number can be taught to channel, and an even tinier
number have the ability inborn. For these few there is no need to
be taught; they will touch the True Source and channel the Power
whether they want to or not, perhaps without even realizing what
they are doing. This inborn ability usually manifests itself in
late adolescence or early adulthood. If control is not taught, or
self-learned (extremely difficult, with a success rate of only one
in four), death is certain. Since the Time of Madness, no man has
been able to channel the Power without eventually going completely,
horribly mad, and then, even if he has learned some control, dying
from a wasting sickness that causes the sufferer to rot alive, a
sickness caused, as is the madness, by the Dark One&rsquo;s taint on
<em>saidin</em>. For a woman the death that comes without control
of the Power is less horrible, but it is death just the same. Aes
Sedai search for girls with the inborn ability as much to save
their lives as to increase Aes Sedai numbers, and for men with it
in order to stop the terrible things they inevitably do with the
Power in their madness. <em><strong>See also</strong></em> channel;

<dt><strong><em>Questioners, the</em></strong>:</dt>

<dd>An order within the Children of the Light. Their avowed
purposes are to discover the truth in disputations and to uncover
Darkfriends. In the search for truth and the Light, their normal
method of inquiry is by torture; their normal attitude that they
know the truth already and must only make their victim confess to
it. The Questioners refer to themselves as the Hand of the Light,
the Hand that digs out truth, and at times act as if they were
entirely separate from the Children and the Council of the
Anointed, which commands the Children. The head of the Questioners
is the High Inquisitor, who sits on the Council of the Anointed.
Their sign is a blood-red shepherd&rsquo;s crook.</dd>

<dd>Any one of a number of objects that allow an individual to
channel much more of the One Power than would otherwise be possible
or safe. A <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em> is like unto, but much more powerful
than, an <em>angreal</em>. The amount of the Power that can be
wielded with a <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em> compares to the amount of the
Power that can be handled with an <em>angreal</em> as the power
wielded with the aid of an <em>angreal</em> does to the amount of

Source exists. Attempts to wield the One Power from outside a

boundary. No Trolloc will enter a <em>stedding</em> unless driven,

<dt><strong><em>Warder</em></strong>:</dt>

<dd>A warrior bonded to an Aes Sedai. The bonding is a thing of the
One Power, and by it he gains such gifts as quick healing, the
ability to go long periods without food, water, or rest, and the
ability to sense the taint of the Dark One at a distance. So long
as a Warder lives, the Aes Sedai to whom he is bonded knows he is
alive however far away he is, and when he dies she will know the
moment and manner of his death. The bonding does not tell her how
far he is, though, nor in what direction. While most Ajahs believe
an Aes Sedai may have one Warder bonded to her at a time, the Red
Ajah refuses to bond any Warders at all, while the Green Ajah
believe an Aes Sedai may bond as many Warders as she wishes.
Ethically the Warder must accede to the bonding, but it has been
known to be done involuntarily. What the Aes Sedai gain from the
bonding is a closely held secret. <em><strong>See

<dt><strong><em>War of the Hundred Years</em></strong>:</dt>

<dd>A series of overlapping wars among constantly shifting
alliances, precipitated by the death of Artur Hawkwing and the
resulting struggle for his empire. It lasted from FY 994 to FY
1117. The war depopulated large parts of the lands between the
Aryth Ocean and the Aiel Waste, from the Sea of Storms to the Great
Blight. So great was the destruction that only fragmentary records
of the time remain. The empire of Artur Hawkwing was pulled apart
in the wars, and the nations of the present day were formed.

<dt><strong><em>War of the Shadow</em></strong>:</dt>

<dd>Also known as the War of Power, it ended the Age of Legends. It
began shortly after the attempt to free the Dark One, and soon
involved the whole world. In a world where even the memory of war
had been forgotten, every facet of war was rediscovered, often
twisted by the Dark One&rsquo;s touch on the world, and the One Power was
used as a weapon. The war was ended by the resealing of the Dark
One into his prison. <em><strong>See also</strong></em> Hundred

comes again. The Pattern of an Age is slightly different each time

<dt><strong><em>Wisdom</em></strong>:</dt>

<dd>In villages, a woman chosen by the Women&rsquo;s Circle for her
knowledge of such things as healing, and foretelling the weather,
as well as for common good sense. A position of great
responsibility and authority, both actual and implied. She is
generally considered the equal of the mayor, just as the Women&rsquo;s
Circle is the equal of the Village Council. Unlike the mayor, the
Wisdom is chosen for life, and it is very rare for a Wisdom to be
removed from office before her death. Depending on the land, she
may instead have another title, such as Guide, Healer, Wise Woman,
or Reader.</dd>
