<h4><em>Among the Elders</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">A</span>s
Juin took them through the Ogier town, Rand saw
that Loial was growing more and more anxious. Loial&rsquo;s ears were as
stiff as his back; his eyes grew bigger every time he saw another
Ogier looking at him, especially the women and girls, and a large
number of them did seem to take notice of him. He looked as if he
expected his own execution.</p>

<p>The bearded Ogier gestured to wide steps leading down
into a grassy mound that was bigger by far than any other; it was a
hill, for all practical purposes, almost at the base of one of the
Great Trees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you wait out here, Loial?&rdquo; Rand said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Elders&mdash;&rdquo; Juin began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Probably just want to see the rest of us,&rdquo;
Rand finished for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they leave him alone,&rdquo; Mat put in.</p>

<p>Loial nodded vigorously. &ldquo;Yes. Yes, I think&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; A
number of Ogier women were watching him, from white-haired
grandmothers to daughters Erith&rsquo;s age, a knot of them talking among
themselves but with all eyes on him. His ears jerked, but he looked
at the broad door to which the stone steps led down, and nodded
again. &ldquo;Yes, I will sit out here, and I&rsquo;ll read. That is it. I will
read.&rdquo; Fumbling in his coat pocket, he produced a book. He settled
himself on the mound beside the steps, the book small in his hands,
and fixed his eyes on the pages. &ldquo;I will just sit here and read
until you come out.&rdquo; His ears twitched as if he could feel the
women&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>Juin shook his head, then shrugged and motioned to
the steps again. &ldquo;If you please. The Elders are waiting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The huge, windowless room inside the mound was scaled
for Ogier, with a thick-beamed ceiling more than four spans up; it
could have fit in any palace, for size at least. The seven Ogier
seated on the dais directly in front of the door made it shrink a
little by their size, but Rand still felt as if he were in a
cavern. The somber floorstones were smooth, if large and irregular
in shape, but the gray walls could have been the rough side of a
cliff. The ceiling beams, rough-hewn as they were, looked like
great roots.</p>

<p>Except for a high-backed chair where Verin sat facing
the dais, the only furnishings were the heavy, vine-carved chairs
of the Elders. The Ogier woman in the middle of the dais sat in a
chair raised a little higher than those of the others, three
bearded men to her left in long, flaring coats, three women to her
right in dresses like her own, embroidered in vines and flowers
from neckline to hem. All had aged faces and pure white hair, even
to the tufts on their ears, and an air of massive dignity.</p>

<p>Hurin gaped at them openly, and Rand felt like
staring himself. Not even Verin had the appearance of wisdom that
was in the Elders&rsquo; huge eyes, nor Morgase in her crown their
authority, nor Moiraine their calm serenity. Ingtar was the first
to bow, as formally as Rand had ever seen from him, while the
others still stood rooted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Alar,&rdquo; the Ogier woman on the highest chair
said when they had finally taken their places beside Verin, &ldquo;Eldest
of the Elders of Stedding Tsofu. Verin has told us that you have
need to use the Waygate here. To recover the Horn of Valere from
Darkfriends is a great need, indeed, but we have allowed none to
travel the Ways in more than one hundred years. Neither us, nor the
Elders of any other <em>stedding</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will find the Horn,&rdquo; Ingtar said angrily. &ldquo;I must.
If you will not permit us to use the Waygate&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He fell silent
as Verin looked at him, but the scowl remained on his face.</p>

<p>Alar smiled. &ldquo;Be not so hasty, Shienaran. You humans
never take time for thought. Only decisions reached in calm can be
sure.&rdquo; Her smile faded to seriousness, but her voice kept its own
measured calm. &ldquo;The dangers of the Ways are not to be faced with a
sword in your hand, not charging Aiel or ravening Trollocs. I must
tell you that to enter the Ways is to risk not only death and
madness, but perhaps your very souls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have seen <em>Machin Shin</em>,&rdquo; Rand said, and
Mat and Perrin agreed. They could not manage to sound eager to do
it again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will follow the Horn to Shayol Ghul itself, if
need be,&rdquo; Ingtar said firmly. Hurin only nodded as if including
himself in Ingtar&rsquo;s words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring Trayal,&rdquo; Alar commanded, and Juin, who had
remained by the door, bowed and left. &ldquo;It is not enough,&rdquo; she told
Verin, &ldquo;to hear what can happen. You must see it, know it in your
heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was an uncomfortable silence until Juin
returned, and it became more uncomfortable still as two Ogier women
followed him, guiding a dark-bearded Ogier of middle years, who
shambled between them as if he did not quite know how his legs
worked. His face sagged, without any expression at all, and his big
eyes were vacant and unblinking, not staring, not looking, not even
seeming to see. One of the women gently wiped drool from the corner
of his mouth. They took his arms to stop him; his foot went
forward, hesitated, then fell back with a thump. He seemed as
content to stand as to walk, or at least as uncaring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trayal was one of the last among us to go along the
Ways,&rdquo; Alar said softly. &ldquo;He came out as you see him. Will you
touch him, Verin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verin gave her a long look, then rose and strode to
Trayal. He did not move as she laid her hands on his wide chest,
not even a flicker of an eye to acknowledge her touch. With a sharp
hiss, she jerked back, staring up at him, then whirled to face the
Elders. &ldquo;He is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;empty. This body lives, but there is nothing
inside it. Nothing.&rdquo; Every Elder wore a look of unbearable
sadness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; one of the Elders to Alar&rsquo;s right said
softly. Her eyes seemed to hold all the pain Trayal&rsquo;s no longer
could. &ldquo;No mind. No soul. Nothing of Trayal remains but his
body.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was a fine Treesinger,&rdquo; one of the men
sighed.</p>

<p>Alar motioned, and the two women turned Trayal to
lead him out; they had to move him before he began to walk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know the risks,&rdquo; Verin said. &ldquo;But whatever the
risks, we must follow the Horn of Valere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Eldest nodded. &ldquo;The Horn of Valere. I do not know
whether it is worse news that it is in Darkfriend hands, or that it
has been found at all.&rdquo; She looked down the row of Elders; each
nodded in turn, one of the men tugging his beard doubtfully first.
&ldquo;Very well. Verin tells me time is urgent. I will show you to the
Waygate myself.&rdquo; Rand was feeling half relieved and half afraid,
when she added, &ldquo;You have with you a young Ogier. Loial, son of
Arent son of Halan, from Stedding Shangtai. He is far from his
home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We need him,&rdquo; Rand said quickly. His words slowed
under surprised stares from the Elders and Verin, but he went on
stubbornly. &ldquo;We need him to go with us, and he wants to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Loial&rsquo;s a friend,&rdquo; Perrin said, at the same time
that Mat said, &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t get in the way, and he carries his own
weight.&rdquo; Neither of them appeared comfortable at having the Elders&rsquo;
focus shift to them, but they did not back down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there some reason he cannot come with us?&rdquo; Ingtar
asked. &ldquo;As Mat says, he has held his own. I don&rsquo;t know that we need
him, but if he wants to come, why&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do need him,&rdquo; Verin broke in smoothly. &ldquo;Few any
longer know the Ways, but Loial has studied them. He can decipher
the Guidings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alar eyed them each in turn, then settled to a study
of Rand. She looked as if she knew things; all the Elders did, but
she most of all. &ldquo;Verin says you are <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>,&rdquo; she said
at last, &ldquo;and I can feel it in you. That I can do so means that you
must be very strongly <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> indeed, for such Talents
ever run weakly in us, if at all. Have you drawn Loial, son of
Arent son of Halan, into <em>ta&rsquo;maral&rsquo;ailen</em>, the Web the
Pattern weaves around you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I just want to find the Horn and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Rand
let the rest of it die. Alar had not mentioned Mat&rsquo;s dagger. He did
not know whether Verin had told the Elders, or held it back for
some reason. &ldquo;He is my friend, Eldest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your friend,&rdquo; Alar said. &ldquo;He is young by our way of
thinking. You are young, too, but <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>. You will look
after him, and when the weaving is done, you will see that he comes
safely home to Stedding Shangtai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; he told her. It had the feeling of a
commitment, the swearing of an oath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we will go to the Waygate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Outside, Loial scrambled to his feet when they
appeared, Alar and Verin leading. Ingtar sent Hurin off at a run to
fetch Uno and the other soldiers. Loial eyed the Eldest warily,
then fell in with Rand at the rear of the procession. The Ogier
women who had been watching him were all gone. &ldquo;Did the Elders say
anything about me? Did she&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; He peered at Alar&rsquo;s broad back
as she ordered Juin to have their horses brought. She started off
with Verin while Juin was still bowing himself away, bending her
head to talk quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She told Rand to take care of you,&rdquo; Mat told Loial
solemnly as they followed, &ldquo;and see you got home safely as a babe.
I don&rsquo;t see why you can&rsquo;t stay here and get married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She said you could come with us.&rdquo; Rand glared at
Mat, which made Mat chortle under his breath. It sounded odd,
coming from that drawn face. Loial was twirling the stem of a
trueheart blossom between his fingers. &ldquo;Did you go picking
flowers?&rdquo; Rand asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Erith gave it to me.&rdquo; Loial watched the yellow
petals spin. &ldquo;She really is very pretty, even if Mat does not see
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does that mean you don&rsquo;t want to go with us after
all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial gave a start. &ldquo;What? Oh, no. I mean, yes. I do
want to go. She only gave me a flower. Just a flower.&rdquo; He took a
book out of his pocket, though, and pressed the blossom under the
front cover. As he returned the book, he murmured to himself,
barely loud enough for Rand to hear, &ldquo;And she said I was handsome,
too.&rdquo; Mat let out a wheeze and doubled over, staggering along
clutching his sides, and Loial&rsquo;s cheeks colored. &ldquo;Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she
said it. I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin rapped Mat smartly on the top of his head with
his knuckles. &ldquo;Nobody ever said Mat was handsome. He&rsquo;s just
jealous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true,&rdquo; Mat said, straightening abruptly.
&ldquo;Neysa Ayellin thinks I&rsquo;m handsome. She&rsquo;s told me so more than
once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Neysa pretty?&rdquo; Loial asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has a face like a goat,&rdquo; Perrin said blandly.
Mat choked, trying to get his protests out.</p>

<p>Rand grinned in spite of himself. Neysa Ayellin was
almost as pretty as Egwene. And this was almost like old times,
almost like being back home, bantering back and forth, and nothing
more important in the world than a laugh and twitting the other
fellow.</p>

<p>As they made their way through the town, Ogier
greeted the Eldest, bowing or curtsying, eyeing the human visitors
with interest. Alar&rsquo;s set face kept anyone from stopping to speak,
though. The only thing that indicated when they left the town was
the absence of the mounds; there were still Ogier about, examining
trees, or sometimes working with pitch and saw or axe where there
were dead limbs or where a tree needed more sunlight. They handled
the tasks tenderly.</p>

<p>Juin joined them, leading their horses, and Hurin
came riding with Uno and the other soldiers, and the packhorses,
just before Alar pointed and said, &ldquo;It is over there.&rdquo; The banter
died.</p>

<p>Rand felt a momentary surprise. The Waygate had to be
Outside the <em>stedding</em>&mdash;the Ways had been begun with
the One Power; they could not have been made inside&mdash;but
there was nothing to indicate they had crossed the boundary. Then
he realized there was a difference; the sense of something lost
that he had felt since entering the <em>stedding</em> was gone.
That gave him another sort of chill. <em>Saidin</em> was there
again. Waiting.</p>

<p>Alar led them past a tall oak, and there in a small
clearing stood the big slab of the Waygate, the front of it
delicately worked in tightly woven vines and leaves from a hundred
different plants. Around the edge of the clearing the Ogier had
built a low stone coping that seemed as if it had grown there,
suggesting a circle of roots. The look of it made Rand
uncomfortable. It took him a moment to realize that the roots
suggested were those of bramble and briar, burningleaf and itch
oak. Not the sort of plants into which anyone would want to
stumble.</p>

<p>The Eldest stopped short of the coping. &ldquo;The wall is
meant to warn away any who comes here. Not that many of us do. I
myself will not cross it. But you may.&rdquo; Juin did not go as close as
she did; he kept rubbing his hands on the front of his coat, and
would not look at the Waygate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Verin told her. &ldquo;The need is great, or I
would not have asked it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand tensed as the Aes Sedai stepped over the coping
and approached the Waygate. Loial took a deep breath and muttered
to himself. Uno and the rest of the soldiers shifted in their
saddles and loosened swords in their scabbards. There was nothing
along the Ways against which a sword would be any use, but it was
something to convince themselves they were ready. Only Ingtar and
the Aes Sedai seemed calm; even Alar gripped her skirt with both
hands.</p>

<p>Verin plucked the <em>Avendesora</em> leaf, and Rand
leaned forward intently. He knew an urge to assume the void, to be
where he could reach <em>saidin</em> if he needed to.</p>

<p>The greenery carved across the Waygate stirred in an
unfelt breeze, leaves fluttering as a gap opened down the center of
the mass and the two halves began to swing open.</p>

<p>Rand stared at the first crack. There was no dull,
silvery reflection behind it, only blackness blacker than pitch.
&ldquo;Close it!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;The Black Wind! Close it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verin took one startled look and thrust the
three-pointed leaf back in among all the varied leaves already
there; it stayed when she took her hand away and backed toward the
coping. As soon as the <em>Avendesora</em> leaf was back in its
place, the Waygate immediately began to close. The crack
disappeared, vines and leaves merging, hiding the blackness of <em>
Machin Shin</em>, and the Waygate was only stone again, if stone
carved in a nearer semblance of life than seemed possible.</p>

<p>Alar let out a shuddering breath. &ldquo;<em>Machin
Shin</em>. So close.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t try to come out,&rdquo; Rand said. Juin made a
strangled sound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have told you,&rdquo; Verin said, &ldquo;the Black Wind is a
creature of the Ways. It cannot leave them.&rdquo; She sounded calm, but
she still wiped her hands on her skirt. Rand opened his mouth, then
gave it up. &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;I wonder at it being here.
First in Cairhien, now here. I wonder.&rdquo; She gave Rand a sidelong
glance that made him jump. The look was so quick that he did not
think anyone else noticed it, but to Rand it seemed to connect him
with the Black Wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never heard of this,&rdquo; Alar said slowly,
&ldquo;<em>Machin Shin</em> waiting when a Waygate was opened. It always
roamed the Ways. But it has been long, and perhaps the Black Wind
hungers, and hopes to catch some unwary one entering a gate. Verin,
assuredly you cannot use this Waygate. And however great your need,
I cannot say I am sorry. The Ways belong to the Shadow, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand frowned at the Waygate. <em>Could it be
following me?</em> There were too many questions. Had Fain somehow
ordered the Black Wind? Verin said it could not be done. And why
would Fain demand that he follow, then try to stop him? He only
knew that he believed the message. He had to go to Toman Head. If
they found the Horn of Valere and Mat&rsquo;s dagger under a bush
tomorrow, he still had to go.</p>

<p>Verin stood with eyes unfocused in thought. Mat was
sitting on the coping with his head in his hands, and Perrin
watched him worriedly. Loial seemed relieved that they could not
use the Waygate, and ashamed at being relieved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are done for here,&rdquo; Ingtar announced. &ldquo;Verin
Sedai, I followed you here against my better judgment, but I can no
longer follow. I mean to return to Cairhien. Barthanes can tell me
where the Darkfriends went, and somehow I will make him do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fain went to Toman Head,&rdquo; Rand said wearily. &ldquo;And
where he went, that&rsquo;s where the Horn is, and the dagger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Perrin shrugged reluctantly. &ldquo;I
suppose we could try another Waygate. At another <em>
stedding</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial stroked his chin and spoke quickly, as if to
make up for his relief at the failure here. &ldquo;Stedding Cantoine lies
just above the River Iralell, and Stedding Taijing is east of it in
the Spine of the World. But the Waygate in Caemlyn, where the grove
was, is closer, and the gate in the grove at Tar Valon is closest
of all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whichever Waygate we try to use,&rdquo; Verin said
absently, &ldquo;I fear we will find <em>Machin Shin</em> waiting.&rdquo; Alar
looked at her questioningly, but the Aes Sedai said no more that
anyone could hear. She muttered to herself instead, shaking her
head as if arguing with herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What we need,&rdquo; Hurin said diffidently, &ldquo;is one of
those Portal Stones.&rdquo; He looked to Alar, then Verin, and when
neither told him to stop, he went on, sounding increasingly
confident. &ldquo;The Lady Selene said those old Aes Sedai had studied
those worlds, and that was how they knew how to make the Ways. And
that place we were&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well, it only took us two days less to
travel a hundred leagues. If we could use a Portal Stone to go to
that world, or one like it, why, it&rsquo;d take no more than a week or
two to reach the Aryth Ocean, and we could come back right on Toman
Head. Maybe it isn&rsquo;t so quick as the Ways, but it&rsquo;s a long sight
quicker than riding off west. What do you say, Lord Ingtar? Lord
Rand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verin answered him. &ldquo;What you suggest might be
possible, sniffer, but as well hope to open this Waygate again and
find <em>Machin Shin</em> gone as hope to find a Portal Stone. I
know none closer than the Aiel Waste. Though we could go back into
Kinslayer&rsquo;s Dagger, if you, or Rand, or Loial think you could find
that Stone again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand looked at Mat. His friend had lifted his head
hopefully at this talk of the Stones. A few weeks, Verin had said.
If they simply rode west, Mat would never live to see Toman
Head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can find it,&rdquo; Rand said reluctantly. He felt
ashamed. <em>Mat&rsquo;s going to die, Darkfriends have the Horn of
Valere, Fain will hurt Emond&rsquo;s Field if you don&rsquo;t follow him, and
you&rsquo;re afraid to channel the Power. Once to go and once to come
back. Twice more won&rsquo;t drive you mad</em>. What really made him
afraid, though, was the eagerness that leaped inside him at the
thought of channeling again, of feeling the Power fill him, of
feeling truly alive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not understand this,&rdquo; Alar said slowly. &ldquo;The
Portal Stones have not been used since the Age of Legends. I did
not think there was anyone who still knew how to use them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Brown Ajah knows many things,&rdquo; Verin said dryly,
&ldquo;and I know how the Stones may be used.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Eldest nodded. &ldquo;Truly there are wonders in the
White Tower of which we do not dream. But if you can use a Portal
Stone, there is no need for you to ride to Kinslayer&rsquo;s Dagger.
There is a Stone not far from where we stand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills, and the Pattern
provides what is needful.&rdquo; The absent look dropped from Verin&rsquo;s
face altogether. &ldquo;Take us to it,&rdquo; she said briskly. &ldquo;We have lost
more than enough time already.&rdquo;</p>
