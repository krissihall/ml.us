<h4><em>The Scent of Madness</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">S</span>eeking
through the falling snow for Dannil, Perrin
found him at one of the fires and pushed between the horses. The
other men straightened and backed away enough to give him room. Not
knowing whether to offer sympathy, they barely looked at him, and
jerked their eyes away when they did, hiding their faces in their
cowls. &ldquo;Do you know where Masema&rsquo;s people are?&rdquo; he asked, then
had to conceal a yawn behind his hand. His body wanted sleep, but
there was no time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About three miles south and west,&rdquo; Dannil replied in
a sour voice, and tugged irritably at his mustache. So the
goose-brains had been right after all. &ldquo;Flocking in like ducks into
the Waterwood in autumn, and the lot of them look like they&rsquo;d
skin their own mothers.&rdquo; Horse-faced Lem al&rsquo;Dai spat in
disgust through the gap in his teeth he had gotten tussling with a
wool merchant&rsquo;s guard long ago. Lem liked to fight with his
fists; he looked eager to pick a scrap with some of Masema&rsquo;s
followers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They would, if Masema said to,&rdquo; Perrin said quietly.
&ldquo;Best you make sure everybody remembers that. You&rsquo;ve heard how
Berelain&rsquo;s men died?&rdquo; Dannil gave a sharp nod, and some of the
others shifted their boots and muttered angrily under their breath.
&ldquo;Just so you know. There&rsquo;s no proof of anything, yet.&rdquo; Lem
snorted, and the rest looked about as bleak as Dannil. They had
seen the corpses Masema&rsquo;s followers left behind.</p>

<p>The snow was picking up, fat flakes that dotted the
men&rsquo;s cloaks. The horses kept their tails tucked in against
the cold. It would be a full blizzard again in a few hours, if not
sooner. No weather to be leaving the fires&rsquo; warmth. No weather
to be on the move.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring everybody off the hill and start toward where
the ambush was,&rdquo; he ordered. That was one of the decisions he had
made, walking back. He had delayed too long already, no matter who
or what was out there. The renegade Aiel had too much lead as it
was, and if they were headed in any direction but south or east,
someone would have brought word by this time. By this time, they
would expect him to be following. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll ride until I have a
better idea where we&rsquo;re heading, then Grady or Neald will take
us there through a gateway. Send men to Berelain and Arganda. I
want the Mayeners and Ghealdanin moving, too. Put scouts out, and
flankers, and tell them not to look for Aiel so hard they forget
there are others who might want to kill us. I don&rsquo;t want to
stumble into anything before I know it&rsquo;s there. And ask the
Wise Ones to stay close to us.&rdquo; He would not put it past Arganda to
try putting them to the question in spite of his orders. If the
Wise Ones killed some of the Ghealdanin defending themselves, the
fellow might strike out entirely on his own, fealty or no. He had
the feeling he was going to need every fighting man he could find.
&ldquo;Be as firm as you dare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dannil took in the flood of orders calmly, but at the
last his mouth twisted in a sickly grimace. Likely, he would as
soon try to be firm with the Women&rsquo;s Circle back home. &ldquo;As you
say, Lord Perrin,&rdquo; he said stiffly, touching a knuckle to his
forehead before he swung into his high-cantled saddle and began
calling out orders.</p>

<p>Surrounded by men scrambling to mount, Perrin caught
Kenly Maerin&rsquo;s sleeve while the young man still had one foot
in his stirrup and asked him to have Stepper saddled and
brought.</p>

<p>With a wide grin, Kenly knuckled <em>his</em>
forehead. &ldquo;As you say, Lord Perrin. Right away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin growled inside his head as Kenly tramped
toward the horselines pulling his brown gelding behind. The young
whelp should not grow a beard if he was going to scratch at it all
the time. The thing was straggly, anyway.</p>

<p>Waiting for his horse, he moved close to the blaze.
Faile said he had to live with all the Lord Perrining and bowing
and scraping, and most of the time he managed to ignore it, but
today it was another drop of bile. He could feel a chasm growing
wider between him and the other men from home, and he seemed to be
the only one who wanted to bridge it. Gill found him muttering to
himself as he held his hands out to the flames.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me for bothering you, my Lord,&rdquo; Gill said,
bowing and briefly snatching off his floppy hat to reveal a thinly
thatched scalp. The hat went right back on his head again to keep
off the snow. City bred, he felt the cold badly. The stout man was
not obsequious&mdash;few Caemlyn innkeepers were&mdash;but he
seemed to enjoy a certain amount of formality. He had certainly
fitted into his new job well enough to please Faile. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
young Tallanvor. At first light, he saddled his horse and went off.
He said you gave him permission, if&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;if the search parties
hadn&rsquo;t gotten back by then, but I wondered, since you
wouldn&rsquo;t let anyone else go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fool. Everything about Tallanvor marked him an
experienced soldier, though he had never been very clear about his
background, but alone against Aiel, he was a hare chasing weasels.
<em>Light, I want to be riding with him! I shouldn&rsquo;t have
listened to Berelain about ambushes</em>. But there had been
another ambush. Arganda&rsquo;s scouts might end the same way. But
he had to move. He had to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said aloud. &ldquo;I told him he could.&rdquo; If he
said otherwise, he might have to take notice later. Lords had to do
that sort of thing. If he ever saw the man alive again. &ldquo;You sound
as though you want to go hunting yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;very fond of Maighdin, my Lord,&rdquo; Gill
replied. Quiet dignity marked his voice, and a degree of stiffness,
as though Perrin had said he was too old and fat for the task. He
certainly smelled of vexation, all prickly and ginger, though his
cold-reddened face was smooth. &ldquo;Not like Tallanvor&mdash;nothing
like that, of course&mdash;but very fond all the same. And of the
Lady Faile, of course,&rdquo; he added hastily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that it
seems I&rsquo;ve known Maighdin my whole life. She deserves
better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin&rsquo;s sigh misted in front of his mouth. &ldquo;I
understand, Master Gill.&rdquo; He did. He himself wanted to rescue
everyone, but he knew if he had to choose, he would take Faile and
let the others go. Everything could go, to save her. Horse-scent
was heavy in the air, but he smelled someone else who was
irritated, and looked over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Lini was glaring at him from the middle of the
turmoil, shifting her ground just enough to keep from being ridden
down accidentally by men jostling to form ragged files. One bony
hand gripped the edge of her cloak, and the other held a
brass-studded cudgel, nearly as long as her arm. It was a wonder
she had not gone with Tallanvor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear as soon as I do,&rdquo; he promised her.
A rumbling in his middle reminded him suddenly and forcefully of
that stew he had scorned. He could almost taste the mutton and
lentils. Another yawn cracked his jaws. &ldquo;Forgive me, Lini,&rdquo; he said
when he could talk. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get much sleep last night. Or a
bite to eat. Is there anything? Some bread, and whatever&rsquo;s to
hand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s eaten long since,&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;The
scraps are gone, and the kettles cleaned and stored away. Sup from
too many dishes, and you deserve a bellyache that&rsquo;ll split you
open. Especially when they&rsquo;re not your dishes.&rdquo; Trailing off
into dissatisfied mutters, she scowled at him a moment longer
before stalking away, glaring at the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too many dishes?&rdquo; Perrin muttered. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
had a one; that&rsquo;s my trouble, not a bellyache.&rdquo; Lini was
making her way across the campground, threading her way between
horses and carts. Three or four men spoke to her in passing, and
she barked at every one, even shaking her cudgel if they failed to
take the hint. The woman must be out of her mind over Maighdin. &ldquo;Or
was that one of her sayings? They usually make more sense than
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well, as to that, now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Gill snatched
his hat off again and peered inside, then stuffed it back on. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I have to see to the carts, my Lord. Need to make sure
all&rsquo;s ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A blind man could see the carts are ready,&rdquo; Perrin
told him. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gill&rsquo;s head swung wildly in search of another
excuse. Finding none, he wilted. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I suppose you&rsquo;ll
hear sooner or later,&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;You see, my Lord, Lini&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;
He drew a deep breath. &ldquo;She walked over to the Mayener camp this
morning, before sunrise, to see how you were and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;why
you hadn&rsquo;t come back. The First&rsquo;s tent was dark, but one
of her maids was awake, and she told Lini&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She implied&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I
mean to say&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t look at me that way, my Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin smoothed the snarl from his face. Tried to, at
any rate. It stayed in his voice. &ldquo;Burn me, I <em>slept</em> in
that tent, man. That is all I did! You tell her that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A violent coughing fit wracked the stout man. &ldquo;Me?&rdquo;
Gill wheezed once he could talk. &ldquo;You want <em>me</em> to tell her?
She&rsquo;ll crack my pate if I <em>mention</em> a thing like that!
I think the woman was born in Far Madding in a thunderstorm. She
probably told the thunder to be quiet. It probably did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re <em>shambayan</em>,&rdquo; Perrin told him.
&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t all be loading carts in the snow.&rdquo; He wanted to bite
someone!</p>

<p>Gill seemed to sense it. Mumbling his courtesies, he
made a jerky bow and scurried away clutching his cloak close. Not
to find Lini, Perrin was sure. Gill ordered the household, such as
it was, but never her. No one ordered Lini except Faile.</p>

<p>Glumly Perrin watched the scouts ride out through the
falling snow, ten men already watching the trees around them before
they were beyond sight of the carts. Light, women would believe
anything about a man so long as it was bad. And the worse it was,
the more they had to talk about it. He had thought Rosene and Nana
were all he had to worry about. Likely Lini had told Breane,
Faile&rsquo;s other maid, first thing on getting back, and by this
time, Breane surely had told every woman in the camp. There were
plenty among the horse handlers and cart drivers, and Cairhienin
being Cairhienin, they probably had been eager to pass everything
on to the men, too. That sort of thing was not seen with charity in
the Two Rivers. Once you gained the reputation, losing it was not
easy. Suddenly the men backing away to give him room took on a new
light, and the uncertain way they had looked at him, and even Lem
spitting. In memory, Kenly&rsquo;s grin became a smirk. The one
bright spot was that Faile would not believe it. Of course she
would not. Certainly not.</p>

<p>Kenly returned at a stumbling trot through the snow,
drawing Stepper and his own rangy gelding behind. Both horses were
miserable with the cold, their ears folded back and tails tight,
and the dun stallion made no effort to bite at Kenly&rsquo;s mount,
as he usually would have.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t show your teeth all the time,&rdquo; Perrin
snapped, snatching Stepper&rsquo;s reins. The boy eyed him
doubtfully, then slunk away glancing back over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Growling under his breath, Perrin checked the
stallion&rsquo;s saddle girth. It was time to find Masema, but he
did not mount. He told himself it was because he was tired and
hungry, that he wanted just a bit of rest and something in his
belly, if he could find anything. He told himself that, but he kept
seeing burned farms and bodies hanging by the side of the road, men
and women and even children. Even if Rand was still in Altara, it
was a long way. A long way, and he had no choice. None he could
make himself take.</p>

<p>He was standing with his forehead sunk against
Stepper&rsquo;s saddle when a delegation of the young fools who had
attached them selves to Faile sought him out, near a dozen of them.
He straightened wearily, wishing the snow would bury them all.</p>

<p>Selande planted herself alongside Stepper&rsquo;s
hindquarters, a short slender woman with green-gloved fists on her
hips and an angry scowl creasing her forehead. She managed to
swagger standing still. Despite the falling snow, one side of her
cloak was thrown back to give easy access to her sword, exposing
six bright slashes across the front of her dark blue coat. All the
women wore men&rsquo;s clothing and swords, and usually they were
twice as ready to use them as the men, which was saying quite a
bit. Men and women alike, they were touchy with everyone, and would
have been fighting duels every day had not Faile put a stop to it.
Men and women alike, the lot with Selande smelled angry, sullen,
sulky and petulant, all jumbled together, a scent that twitched
uncomfortably in his nose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you, my Lord Perrin,&rdquo; Selande said formally in
the crisp accents of Cairhien. &ldquo;Preparations are being made to move
out, but still we are refused our horses. Will you have this made
right?&rdquo; She made it sound a demand.</p>

<p>She saw him, did she? He wished he did not see her.
&ldquo;Aiel walk,&rdquo; he growled, and stifled a yawn, not caring a whit for
the furious glares that earned him. He tried to put sleep out his
mind. &ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t walk, ride on the carts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot do that!&rdquo; one of the Tairen women
announced haughtily, one hand tight on the edge of her cloak, the
other on her sword hilt. Medore was tall, with bright blue eyes in
a dark face, and if she missed beautiful, it was not by much. The
fat, red-striped sleeves of her coat looked decidedly odd with her
full bosom. &ldquo;Redwing is my favorite mount! I won&rsquo;t be denied
her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Third time,&rdquo; Selande said cryptically. &ldquo;When we stop
tonight, we will discuss your <em>toh</em>, Medore Damara.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Supposedly, Medore&rsquo;s father was an aging man who
had retired to his country estates years ago, but Astoril was still
a High Lord for all that. As those things were reckoned, that put
his daughter well above Selande, only a minor noble in Cairhien.
Yet Medore swallowed hard, and her eyes widened till she looked as
though she expected to be skinned alive.</p>

<p>Abruptly Perrin had had all he could take of these
idiots and their dog&rsquo;s dinner of Aiel bits and pieces and pure
highborn jack-foolery. &ldquo;When did you start spying for my wife?&rdquo; he
demanded. They could not have gone stiffer had their backbones
frozen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We carry out such small tasks and errands as the
Lady Faile might require of us from time to time,&rdquo; Selande said
after a long moment, in very careful tones. Wariness was thick in
her scent. The whole gaggle of them smelled like foxes wondering
whether a badger had taken over their den.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did my wife really go hunting, Selande?&rdquo; he growled
heatedly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s never wanted to before.&rdquo; Anger roared in him,
flames fanned by all the events of the day. He pushed Stepper away
with one hand and stepped closer to the woman, looming over her.
The stallion tossed his head, sensing Perrin&rsquo;s humor. His fist
ached in his gauntlet from its grip on the reins. &ldquo;Or did she ride
out to meet some of you, fresh from Abila? Was she kidnapped
because of your bloody spying?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That made no sense, and he knew it as the words left
his mouth. Faile could have talked with them anywhere. And she
would never have arranged to meet her eyes-and-ears&mdash;Light,
her <em>spies!</em>&mdash;in company with Berelain. It was always
a mistake to speak without thinking. He knew about Masema and the
Seanchan because of their spying. But he wanted to lash out, he
needed to lash out, and the men he wanted to hammer into
nothingness were miles away. With Faile.</p>

<p>Selande did not back away from his anger. Her eyes
narrowed to slits. Her fingers opened and closed on the hilt of her
sword, and she was not alone. &ldquo;We would die for the Lady Faile!&rdquo;
she spat. &ldquo;Nothing we have done has put her in danger! We are sworn
to her by water oath!&rdquo; To Faile and not to him, her tone added.</p>

<p>He should apologize. He knew he should. Instead, he
said, &ldquo;You can have your horses if you give me your word
you&rsquo;ll do as I say and not try anything rash.&rdquo; &ldquo;Rash&rdquo; was not
the word for this lot. They were capable of rushing off alone as
soon as they learned where Faile was. They were capable of getting
Faile killed. &ldquo;When we find her, I will decide how to rescue her.
If your water oath says different, tie a knot in it, or I&rsquo;ll
tie you in knots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her jaw tightened and her scowl deepened, but finally
she said, &ldquo;I agree!&rdquo; as though the words were being pried out of
her. One of the Tairens, a long-nosed fellow named Carlon, grunted
in protest, but Selande raised one finger, and he shut his mouth.
With that narrow chin, he probably regretted shaving off his beard.
The little woman had the rest of these fools in the palm of her
hand, which did not make her any less a fool herself. Water oath,
indeed! She did not take her eyes from Perrin&rsquo;s. &ldquo;We will obey
you until the Lady Faile is returned. Then, we are hers again. And
she can decide our <em>toh</em>.&rdquo; That last seemed more for the
others than him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good enough,&rdquo; he told her. He attempted to moderate
his tone, but his voice was still rough. &ldquo;I know you are loyal to
her, all of you. I respect that.&rdquo; That was about all he did respect
in them. As an apology it was not very much, and that was just how
they took it. A grunt from Selande was the only reply he got, that
and glowers from the rest as they stalked off. So be it. As long as
they kept their word. The whole bunch had never done an honest
day&rsquo;s work between them.</p>

<p>The camp was emptying out. The carts had begun moving
south, sliding on their sleds behind the carthorses. The horses
left deep tracks, but the sleds made only shallow ruts that the
falling snow began to bury immediately. The last of the men from
the hill were scrambling into their saddles and joining the others
already riding with the carts. Just off to one side, the Wise
Ones&rsquo; party began to pass, even the <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>
leading the pack animals themselves mounted. However firm Dannil
had dared to be, or not as was more likely, apparently it had been
enough. The Wise Ones looked particularly awkward on horseback
compared to the grace of Seonid and Masuri, though not so bad as
the <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>. The white-robed men and women had all
been riding since the third day in snow, yet they crouched low over
the tall pommels of their saddles and clung to neck or mane as if
expecting to fall off at the next step. Getting them mounted in the
first place had required direct commands from the Wise Ones, and
some would still slide down and walk if they were not watched.</p>

<p>Perrin pulled himself up onto Stepper. He was not
sure he might not fall off himself. It was time to make this ride
he did not want to make, though. He would have killed for a piece
of bread. Or some cheese. Or a nice rabbit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aiel coming!&rdquo; someone shouted from the head of the
column, and everything came to a halt. More shouts rang out,
passing the word as if everyone had not already heard, and men
unlimbered bows from their backs. Cart drivers stood up on their
seats, peering ahead, or leaped down to crouch beside the cart.
Growling under his breath, Perrin heeled Stepper in the flanks.</p>

<p>At the front of the column, Dannil was still in his
saddle, and the two men carrying those bloody banners, but a good
thirty were on the ground, coverings stripped from their bowstrings
and arrows nocked. The men holding the horses for the dismounted
men jostled about, pointing and trying to get a clear view. Grady
and Neald were there, as well, peering ahead with intent faces but
sitting on their horses calmly. Everyone else reeked of agitation.
The Asha&rsquo;man only smelled&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ready.</p>

<p>Perrin could make out what they were staring at
through the trees a good deal more clearly than they. Ten veiled
Aiel trotting toward them through the falling snow, one leading a
tall white horse. A little behind them rode three men, cloaked and
hooded. There seemed to be something odd in the way the Aiel moved.
And there was a bundle tied to the white&rsquo;s saddle. A fist
gripped Perrin&rsquo;s heart until he realized it was not nearly
large enough to be a body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put up your bows,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
Alliandre&rsquo;s gelding. It must be our people. Can&rsquo;t you see
the Aiel are all Maidens?&rdquo; Not a one was tall enough to be an
Aielman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can barely make out they&rsquo;re Aiel,&rdquo; Dannil
muttered, giving him a sidelong look. They all took it for granted
that his eyes were good, even took pride in it&mdash;or used to&mdash;but he tried to keep them from knowing how good. Right then,
he did not care, though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are ours,&rdquo; he told Dannil. &ldquo;Everybody stay
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slowly he rode out to meet the returning party. The
Maidens began unveiling as he approached. In one of the deep cowls
on the mounted men, he made out Furen Alharra&rsquo;s black face.
The three Warders, then; they would have come back together. Their
horses looked as tired as he felt, near exhaustion. He wanted to
force Stepper to run, to hear what they had to report. He dreaded
hearing. Ravens would have been at the bodies, and foxes, badgers
maybe, and the Light alone knew what besides. Maybe they thought
they were sparing him by not bringing back what they had found. No!
Faile had to be alive. He tried to fix that thought in his head,
but it hurt like gripping a sharp blade bare-handed.</p>

<p>Dismounting in front of them, he stumbled and had to
hold on to the saddle to keep from falling. He felt numb around the
bright pain of holding on to that one thought. She had to be alive.
Little details loomed large, for some reason. Not one bundle
fastened to the elaborately tooled saddle, but a number of small
bundles that looked like gathered rags. The Maidens wore
snowshoes, rough-made of vines and supple pine branches with the
needles still on. That was why they seemed to be moving oddly.
Jondyn must have shown them how to make them. He tried to focus. He
thought his heart was going to pound through his ribs.</p>

<p>Gripping spears and buckler in her left hand, Sulin
took one of the small bundles of cloth from the saddle before she
came to him. The pink scar running down her leathery cheek twisted
as she smiled. &ldquo;Good news, Perrin Aybara,&rdquo; she said softly, handing
him the dark blue cloth. &ldquo;Your wife lives.&rdquo; Alharra exchanged
glances with Seonid&rsquo;s other Warder, Teryl Wynter, who frowned.
Masuri&rsquo;s man, Rovair Kirklin, stared straight ahead stonily.
It was as plain as Wynter&rsquo;s curled mustaches that they were
not sure it was good news. &ldquo;The others press on to see what more
they can find,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;Though we already have found oddities
enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin let the bundle fall open in his hands. It was
Faile&rsquo;s dress, sliced down the front and along the arms. He
inhaled deeply, pulling Faile&rsquo;s scent into him, a faint trace
of her flowery soap, a touch other sweet perfume, but most of all,
the smell that was her. And no hint of blood. The rest of the
Maidens gathered around him, mostly older women with hard faces,
though not as hard as Sulin&rsquo;s. The Warders climbed down,
showing no sign that they had been all night in the saddle, but
they held back behind the Maidens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All of the men were killed,&rdquo; the wiry woman said,
&ldquo;but by the garments we found, Alliandre Kigarin, Maighdin Dorlain,
Lacile Aldorwin, Arrela Shiego, and two more also were made <em>
gai&rsquo;shain</em>.&rdquo; The other two must have been Bain and Chiad;
mentioning them by name, that they had been taken, would have
shamed them. He had learned a little about Aiel. &ldquo;This goes against
custom, but it protects them.&rdquo; Wynter frowned in doubt, then tried
to hide it by adjusting his hood.</p>

<p>The neat cuts were like those made skinning an
animal. It hit Perrin suddenly. Someone had cut Faile&rsquo;s
clothes off! His voice shook. &ldquo;They only took women?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A round-faced young Maiden named Briain shook her
head. &ldquo;Three men would have been made <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>, I
think, but they fought too hard and were killed with knife or
spear. All the rest died by arrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not like that, Perrin Aybara,&rdquo; Elienda said
hurriedly, sounding shocked. A tall woman with wide shoulders, she
managed to look almost motherly, though he had seen her knock a man
down with her fist. &ldquo;Harming a <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> is like
harming a child, or a blacksmith. It was wrong to take wetlanders,
but I cannot believe they will break custom <em>that</em> far. I am
sure they will not even be punished, if they can be meek until they
are recovered. There are others who will show them.&rdquo; Others; Bain
and Chiad again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What direction did they go?&rdquo; he asked. Could Faile
be meek? He could not picture her that way. At least let her try,
till he could find her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Almost south,&rdquo; Sulin replied. &ldquo;Much nearer south
than east. After the snow hid their tracks, Jondyn Barran saw other
traces. What the others are following. I believe him. He sees as
much as Elyas Machera. There is much to see.&rdquo; Thrusting her spears
behind the bow case on her back, she hung her buckler from the hilt
of her heavy belt knife. Her fingers flashed handtalk, and Elienda
unfastened a second, larger bundle and handed it to her. &ldquo;Many
people are moving out there, Perrin Aybara, and strange things.
This you must see first, I think.&rdquo; Sulin unfolded another cut
dress, this one green. He thought he remembered it on Alliandre.
&ldquo;These, we recovered where your wife was taken.&rdquo; Inside, forty or
fifty Aiel arrows shifted in a heap. There were dark stains on the
shafts, and he caught the scent of dried blood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Taardad,&rdquo; Sulin said, picking out an arrow and
immediately throwing it to the ground. &ldquo;Miagoma.&rdquo; She tossed two
more aside. &ldquo;Goshien.&rdquo; Those brought a grimace to her face; she was
Goshien. Clan by clan, she named them all except the Shaido,
dropping arrows until just over half lay scattered around her. She
held up the cut dress holding the remainder in both hands, then
spilled them. &ldquo;Shaido,&rdquo; she said significantly.</p>

<p>Clutching Faile&rsquo;s dress to his chest&mdash;her
scent eased the pain in his heart, and made it worse at the same
time&mdash;Perrin frowned at the arrows jumbled on the snow.
Already, some were half buried in the fresh fall. &ldquo;Too many
Shaido,&rdquo; he said at last. They should all be bottled up in
Kinslayer&rsquo;s Dagger, five hundred leagues distant. But if some
of their Wise Ones had learned to Travel&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Maybe even one of
the Forsaken&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Light, he was rambling like a fool&mdash;what
would the Forsaken have to do with this?&mdash;rambling when he
had to think. His brain felt as weary as the rest of him. &ldquo;The
others are men who wouldn&rsquo;t accept Rand as the <em>
Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>.&rdquo; Those cursed colors flashed in his head. He had
no time for anything but Faile. &ldquo;They joined the Shaido.&rdquo; Some of
the Maidens averted their eyes. Elienda glared at him. They knew
that some had done what he said, but it was one of those things
they did not like to hear said aloud. &ldquo;How many altogether, do you
reckon? Not the whole clan, surely?&rdquo; If the Shaido were here in a
body, there would be more than rumors of distant raids. Even among
all the other troubles, all of Amadicia would know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Near enough to be going on with, I&rsquo;m thinking,&rdquo;
Wynter muttered under his breath. Perrin was not meant to hear.</p>

<p>Reaching in among the bundles tied to the ornate
saddle, Sulin drew out a rag doll dressed in <em>
cadin&rsquo;sor</em>. &ldquo;Elyas Machera found this just before we
turned back, about forty miles from here.&rdquo; She shook her head, and
for a moment her voice and scent became&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;startled. &ldquo;He said he
smelled it beneath the snow. He and Jondyn Barran found scrapes on
the trees they said were caused by carts. Very many carts. If there
are children&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I think it may be a whole sept, Perrin Aybara.
Perhaps more than one. Even a single sept will have at least a
thousand spears, and more at need. Every man but the blacksmiths
will pick up a spear at need. They are days south of us. Perhaps
more days than I think, in this snow. But I believe those who took
your wife are going to meet them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This blacksmith has picked up a spear,&rdquo; Perrin
murmured. A thousand, maybe more. He had over two thousand,
counting the Winged Guards and Arganda&rsquo;s men. Against Aiel,
though, the numbers would favor the Shaido. He fingered the doll in
Sulin&rsquo;s sinewy hand. Was a Shaido child weeping over the loss
of her doll? &ldquo;We go south.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was turning to mount Stepper when Sulin touched
his arm to stop him. &ldquo;I told you we saw other things. Twice, Elyas
Machera found horse droppings and campfires under the snow. Many
horses, and many campfires.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thousands,&rdquo; Alharra put in. His black eyes met
Perrin&rsquo;s levelly, and his voice was matter-of-fact. He was
simply reporting what was. &ldquo;Five, maybe ten or more; it&rsquo;s hard
to tell. But soldiers&rsquo; camps. The same men both places, I
think. Machera and Barran agree. Whoever it is, they&rsquo;re
heading near enough south, too. Maybe they have nothing to do with
the Aiel, but they could be following.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sulin gave the Warder an impatient frown and
continued with barely a pause for his interruption. &ldquo;Three times we
saw flying creatures like those you say the Seanchan use, huge
things with ribbed wings and people riding their backs. And twice
we saw tracks like this.&rdquo; Bending, she picked up one of the arrows
and drew a rounded shape a little like a large bear&rsquo;s paw in
the snow, but with six toes longer than a man&rsquo;s fingers.
&ldquo;Sometimes it shows claws,&rdquo; she said, marking them, longer even
than one of the big bears in the Mountains of Mist. &ldquo;It has a long
stride. I think it runs very fast. Do you know what it is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not&mdash;he had never heard of anything with
six toes except the cats in the Two Rivers; he had been surprised
to find cats elsewhere only had five&mdash;but he could make a
safe guess. &ldquo;Another Seanchan animal.&rdquo; So there were Seanchan to
the south as well as Shaido, and&mdash;what?&mdash;Whitecloaks,
or a Seanchan army. It could not be anyone else. He trusted
Balwer&rsquo;s information. &ldquo;We still go south.&rdquo; The Maidens stared
at him as if he had told them it was snowing.</p>

<p>Pulling himself up into Stepper&rsquo;s saddle, he
turned back toward the column. The Warders walked, leading their
weary horses. The Maidens took Alliandre&rsquo;s gelding with them
as they trotted to where the Wise Ones were standing. Masuri and
Seonid were riding to meet their Warders. He wondered why they all
had not come to stick their noses in. Perhaps it was as simple as
letting him be alone with his grief if the news turned out bad.
Perhaps. In his head, he tried to fit everything together. The
Shaido, however many they were. The Seanchan. The mounted army,
whether Whitecloak or Seanchan. It was like the puzzles Master
Luhhan had taught him to make, intricate twists of metal that slid
apart and slipped back together like a dream, if you knew the
trick. Only, his head felt muddled, groping at pieces that would
not slide anywhere.</p>

<p>The Two Rivers men were all mounted again when he
reached them. Those who had been on the ground with their bows
ready looked a little abashed. They all eyed him uneasily,
tentatively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s alive,&rdquo; he said, and it was as if every
man of them started breathing again. They took the rest of his news
with a strange impassiveness, some even nodding as though they had
expected no less.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t be the first time we&rsquo;ve faced long
odds,&rdquo; Dannil said. &ldquo;What do we do, my Lord?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin grimaced. The man was still stiff as an oak.
&ldquo;For starters, we&rsquo;re Traveling forty miles due south. After
that, I will see. Neald, you go ahead and find Elyas and the
others. Tell them what I&rsquo;m doing. They will be a good deal
further on, by this time. And have a care. You can&rsquo;t fight ten
or a dozen Wise Ones.&rdquo; A whole sept should have at least that many
who could channel. And if it was more than one? A bog he had to
cross when he came to it.</p>

<p>Neald nodded before turning his gelding back toward
the camp, where he had already memorized the ground. There were
only a few more orders to give. Riders had to be sent to find the
Mayeners and Ghealdanin, who would be moving apart as they camped
apart. Grady thought he could memorize the ground right there
before they could join up, so there was no need to turn everything
around and follow Neald back. And that left only one thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I need to find Masema, Dannil,&rdquo; Perrin said.
&ldquo;Somebody who can give him a message, anyway. With luck, I
won&rsquo;t be long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go among that filth alone, my Lord, and
you&rsquo;ll need luck,&rdquo; Dannil replied. &ldquo;I heard some of them
talking about you. Said you&rsquo;re Shadowspawn, because of your
eyes.&rdquo; His gaze met Perrin&rsquo;s golden eyes and slid sideways.
&ldquo;Said you&rsquo;d been tamed by the Dragon Reborn, but still
Shadowspawn. You ought to take a few dozen men to watch your
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin hesitated, patting Stepper&rsquo;s neck. A few
dozen men would not be enough if Masema&rsquo;s people really
thought he was Shadowspawn and decided to take matters into their
own hands. All the Two Rivers men together might not be enough.
Maybe he did not need to tell Masema, just let him learn for
himself.</p>

<p>His ears caught a bluetit&rsquo;s trill from the trees
to the west, followed a moment later by a second that everyone
could hear, and the decision was taken away from him. He was sure
of it, and wondered whether this was part of being <em>
ta&rsquo;veren</em>. He reined Stepper around and waited.</p>

<p>The Two Rivers men knew what it meant, hearing that
particular bird from back home. Men coming, more than a handful,
and not necessarily peaceful. It would have been a crookbill
trilling if they were friends, and a mocker&rsquo;s cry of alarm had
they been clearly unfriendly. This time, they behaved better. Along
the west side of the column, every second man as far as Perrin
could see in the snow dismounted and handed his reins to the man
next to him, then readied his bow.</p>

<p>The strangers appeared through the scattered trees
spread out in a line as if to increase the impression of their
numbers. They were perhaps a hundred, with two in advance, but
their slow advance did seem ominous. Half carried lances, not
couched but held as though ready be tucked under an arm. At a
steady walk they came on. Some wore armor, a breastplate or a
helmet but rarely both. Still, they were better armed than the
general run of Masema&rsquo;s followers. One of the pair out front
was Masema himself, his zealot&rsquo;s face staring out of his
cloak&rsquo;s cowl like a rabid mountain cat staring out of a cave.
How many of those lances had borne a red streamer yesterday
morning?</p>

<p>Masema stopped his men with a raised hand only when
he was just a few paces from Perrin. Pushing back his hood, he ran
his gaze along the dismounted men with their bows. He seemed
unaware of the snow hitting his bare scalp. His companion, a bigger
man with a sword on his back and another at his saddle bow, kept
his cowl up, but Perrin thought his head was shaved, too. That one
managed to study the column and watch Masema with equal intensity.
His dark eyes burned almost as much as Masema&rsquo;s. Perrin
thought about telling them that at this range, a Two Rivers longbow
would put a pile shaft right through a breastplate, and out the
wearer&rsquo;s back besides. He considered mentioning Seanchan.
Discretion, Berelain had counseled. Perhaps it was a fine thing, in
the circumstances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were coming to meet me?&rdquo; Masema said abruptly.
Even the man&rsquo;s voice seethed with intensity. Nothing was ever
casual on his tongue. Anything he had to say was important. The
pale triangular scar on his cheek pulled his sudden smile crooked.
There was no warmth in it anyway. &ldquo;No matter. I am here, now. As
you no doubt know by now, those who follow the Lord Dragon Reborn&mdash;the Light illumine his name!&mdash;refuse to be left
behind. I cannot demand it of them. They serve him as I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin saw a tide of flame rolling across Amadicia
into Altara and perhaps beyond, leaving death and devastation
behind. He took a deep breath, sucking cold into his lungs. Faile
was more important than anything. Anything! If he burned for it,
then he burned. &ldquo;Take your men east.&rdquo; He was shocked at how steady
his voice was. &ldquo;I will catch up when I can. My wife has been
kidnapped by Aiel, and I&rsquo;m heading south to get her back.&rdquo; For
once, he saw Masema surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aiel? So they are more than rumor?&rdquo; He frowned at
the Wise Ones on the far side of the column. &ldquo;South, you say?&rdquo;
Folding his gloved hands on the pommel of his saddle, he turned his
study to Perrin. Insanity filled the man&rsquo;s scent; Perrin could
not find anything but madness in it. &ldquo;I will come with you,&rdquo; Masema
said at last, as if reaching a decision. Odd, he had been impatient
to reach Rand without delay. So long as he did not have to be
touched by the Power to do so, at least. &ldquo;All those who follow the
Lord Dragon Reborn&mdash;the Light illumine his name!&mdash;will
come. Killing Aiel savages is doing the Light&rsquo;s work.&rdquo; His
eyes flickered toward the Wise Ones, and his smile was even colder
than before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would appreciate the help,&rdquo; Perrin lied. That
rabble would be useless against Aiel. Still, they numbered in the
thousands. And they had held off armies, if not armies of Aiel. A
piece of that puzzle in his head shifted. Ready to drop with
fatigue, he could not make out exactly how, just that it had. In
any case, it was not going to happen. &ldquo;They have a long lead on me,
though. I intend to Travel, to use the One Power, to catch up. I
know how you feel about that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uneasy murmurs ran through the men behind Masema, and
they eyed one another and shifted weapons. Perrin caught muttered
curses and also &ldquo;yellow eyes&rdquo; and &ldquo;Shadowspawn.&rdquo; The second
shaven-headed man glared at Perrin as though he had blasphemed, but
Masema just stared, trying to bore a hole into Perrin&rsquo;s head
and see what lay inside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>He</em> would be grieved if harm came to your
wife,&rdquo; the madman said at last. The emphasis named Rand as clearly
as the name Masema did not allow to be spoken. &ldquo;There will be a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;dispensation, in this one instance. Only to find your wife,
because you are his friend. Only this.&rdquo; He spoke calmly&mdash;calmly for him&mdash;but his deep-set eyes were dark fire, his
face contorted with unknowing rage.</p>

<p>Perrin opened his mouth, then closed it without
speaking. The sun might as well rise in the west as Masema say what
he just had. Suddenly Perrin thought that Faile might be safer with
the Shaido than he was here and now.</p>
