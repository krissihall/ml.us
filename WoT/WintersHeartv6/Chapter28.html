<h4><em>News in a Cloth Sack</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
morning after Mat promised to help Teslyn, if he
could&mdash;and Joline, and this Edesina he had yet to lay eyes
on!&mdash;Tylin announced that she was departing the city.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suroth is going to show me how much of Altara I
control now, pigeon,&rdquo; she said. Her belt knife was stuck in the
carved bedpost, and they were still lying on the rumpled linen
sheets amid a tangle of bedding, him in only the silk scarf that
hid the hanging scar around his neck, and her in her skin. A very
fine skin it was, too, as smooth as he had ever touched. Idly she
traced his other scars with a long, green-lacquered fingernail. One
way and another, he had acquired quite a few, though not for want
of trying to avoid them. His hide would not bring much at auction,
that was for sure, but the scars fascinated her. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t
her idea, actually. Tuon thinks it will&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;help me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;if I
see with my own eyes instead of just on a map, and what that girl
suggests, Suroth does. She would like to see it done yesterday,
though. We&rsquo;ll be going by <em>to&rsquo;raken</em>, so to cover
the ground quickly. As much as two hundred miles in a day, it
seems. Oh, don&rsquo;t look sick, piglet. I won&rsquo;t make you
climb on one of those things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat heaved a sigh of relief. It had not been the
prospect of flying that upset him. He thought he might actually
like that. But if he was out of Ebou Dar for any length of time,
the Light alone knew whether Teslyn or Joline or even this Edesina
might grow impatient enough to do something stupid, or what idiocy
Beslan might get up to. Beslan worried him almost as much as the
women. Tylin, excited by her coming flight on one of the Seanchan
beasts, looked more an eagle than ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be gone little more than a week,
sweetling. Hmmm.&rdquo; That green fingernail traced the foot-long
puckering that slanted across his ribs. &ldquo;Shall I tie you to the bed
so I&rsquo;ll know you will be safe till I return?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Returning her wicked smile with his most winning grin
took a bit of effort. He was fairly sure she was joking, but only
fairly. The clothes she chose today put him all in red brilliant
enough to hurt the eye; all red except for the flowers worked on
the coat and the cloak, anyway, and his black hat and scarf. The
white lace at his neck and wrists only made the rest look redder.
Still, he scrambled into them, eager to get out of her apartments.
With Tylin, a man was wise not to be too sure of anything. She
might <em>not</em> be joking, too.</p>

<p>Tylin had not exaggerated Suroth&rsquo;s impatience,
it appeared. In little more than two hours by the jeweled
cylinder-clock in Tylin&rsquo;s sitting room, a gift from Suroth, he
was accompanying the Queen to the docks. Well, Suroth and Tylin
rode at the head of the twenty or so other Blood that were to
accompany them, and their assorted <em>so&rsquo;jhin</em>, men and
women who bowed their half-shaved heads to the Blood and stared
down their noses at everyone else, while he rode behind on Pips. An
Altaran Queen&rsquo;s &ldquo;pretty&rdquo; could not ride with the Blood, which
included Tylin herself now, of course. It was not as if he was a
hereditary servant or anything of that level.</p>

<p>The Blood and most of the <em>so&rsquo;jhin</em> were
mounted on fine animals, sleek mares with arched necks and a
delicate step, deep-chested geldings with fierce eyes and strong
withers. His luck seemed to have no effect on horse racing, but he
would have wagered on Pips against any of them. The blunt-nosed bay
gelding was not showy, but Mat was sure he could outrun nearly all
of those pretty animals in a sprint and all of them over a long
haul. After so long in the stables, Pips wanted to frisk if he
could not run, and it took all Mat&rsquo;s skill&mdash;well, all
the skill that had somehow come with those other men&rsquo;s
memories&mdash;to keep the animal in hand. Before they were
halfway to the docks, though, his leg was aching to the hip. If he
was to leave Ebou Dar any time soon, it would have to be by sea, or
with Luca&rsquo;s show. He had a good notion how to make the man
leave before spring, if it came to that. A dangerous notion, maybe,
but he did not see much choice. The alternative was riskier
still.</p>

<p>He was not alone at the rear. More than fifty men and
women, blessedly wearing thick white woolen robes over the sheer
garments they usually went around in, marched behind him in two
rows, some leading packhorses with large wicker hampers full of
delicacies. The Blood could not do without their servants; in fact,
they seemed to think they would be sleeping rough, with so few. The
<em>da&rsquo;covale</em> seldom raised their eyes from the paving
stones, and their faces were meek as milk. He had seen a <em>
da&rsquo;covale</em> sent for a strapping once, a yellow-haired man
about his age, and the fellow had raced to bring the instrument of
his own punishment. He had not even tried to delay or hide, much
less escape the strapping. Mat could not understand people like
that.</p>

<p>Ahead of him rode six <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>, their
short divided skirts showing their ankles. Very nice ankles on one
or two, but the women sat their saddles as if they were of the
Blood, too. The cowls of their lightning-paneled cloaks hung down
their backs, and they let the cold gusts lift the cloaks as though
the chill did not touch them, or would not dare. Two had leashed
<em>damane</em> walking beside their horses.</p>

<p>Mat studied the women surreptitiously. One of the
<em>damane</em>, a short woman with pale blue eyes, was linked by a
silvery <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> to the plump olive-skinned <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em> he had seen walking Teslyn. The dark-haired <em>
damane</em> answered to the name Pura. The Aes Sedai agelessness
was clear on her smooth face. He had not really believed Teslyn
when she said the woman had become a true <em>damane</em>, but the
graying <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> leaned low in her saddle to say
something to the woman who had been Ryma Galfrey, and whatever it
was the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> murmured, Pura laughed and clapped
her hands in delight.</p>

<p>Mat shivered. She would bloody well shout for help if
he tried to take the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> from her neck. Light, what
was he thinking of! Bad enough that he was stuck with pulling three
Aes Sedai&rsquo;s bacon off the fire for them&mdash;Burn him, but
he did seem to get lumbered with doing that every time he bloody
turned around!&mdash;bad enough that, without thinking about
trying to get any more out of Ebou Dar.</p>

<p>Ebou Dar was a great seaport, with perhaps the
largest harbor in the known world, and the docks were long gray
fingers of stone thrusting out from the quay that ran the whole
length of the city. Almost all the mooring spots were taken by
Seanchan vessels of every size, the crews in the rigging and
cheering vigorously as Suroth passed by, a thunder of voices
calling her name. The men on other ships waved their arms and
shouted as well, though many appeared confused as to who or what
they were cheering. No doubt they thought it expected of them. On
those vessels, the wind blowing across the harbor stirred the
Golden Bees of Illian, and the Crescent Moons of Tear, and the
Golden Hawk of Mayene. Apparently Rand had not ordered the
merchants there to stop trading with Seanchan-held ports, or else
the merchants were going behind his back. Colors flashed through
Mat&rsquo;s skull, and he shook his head to clear it. Most merchants
would trade with their mother&rsquo;s murderer if it brought
profit.</p>

<p>The southernmost dock had been cleared of ships, and
Seanchan officers with thin plumes on their lacquered helmets stood
waiting to hand Suroth and Tylin down into one of the large
rowboats that stood waiting, eight men on the long oars of each.
After Tylin gave Mat a last kiss, anyway, almost yanking his hair
out to pull his head down, and after she pinched his bottom as
though no one was bloody watching! Suroth frowned impatiently until
Tylin was settled in the long boat, and in truth, the Seanchan
woman did not stop chafing even then, twitching her fingers at
Alwhin, her <em>so&rsquo;jhin</em>, so the sharp-faced woman was
continually scrambling across the benches to fetch her one thing or
another.</p>

<p>The rest of the Blood received deep bows from the
officers, but had to climb down the ladders with their <em>
so&rsquo;jhin</em>&rsquo;s aid. The <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> helped the
<em>damane</em> into the boats, and no one at all helped the
white-robed folk load the pack hampers and themselves. Soon enough,
the boats were crossing the harbor toward where the <em>raken</em>
and <em>to&rsquo;raken</em> were kept south of the Rahad, spidering
through the sprawling anchored fleet of Seanchan ships and the
scores of captured Sea Folk vessels that dotted the harbor. The
greater number of those appeared to have been rerigged with ribbed
Seanchan sails and different lines. Their crews were Seanchan, too.
Excepting the Windfinders he tried not to think about, and maybe
some who had been sold, the surviving Atha&rsquo;an Miere were all
in the Rahad with the other <em>da&rsquo;covale</em> clearing the
silted-up canals. And there was nothing he could do about it. He
did not owe them anything, he had more on his plate than he could
handle already, and there was nothing he could do. That was all
there was to it!</p>

<p>He wanted to ride away immediately, to leave the Sea
Folk ships behind him. No one on the docks paid him the slightest
heed. The officers had gone away as soon as the boats cast off.
Someone, he did not know who, had taken the packhorses away. The
seamen climbed out of the rigging and went back to their work, and
the members of the cargo-loaders guild began pushing their low,
heavy barrows stacked with bales and crates and barrels. But if he
left too soon, Tylin might decide he was planning to keep riding
right out of the city and send for him, so he sat Pips on the end
of the dock and waved like a bull goose fool till she was far
enough away that she could not see him without a looking glass.</p>

<p>Despite the throbbing leg, he rode slowly back up
almost the whole length of the quay. He avoided looking at the
harbor again. Soberly dressed merchants stood watching their cargo
being loaded or unloaded, sometimes slipping a purse to a man or
woman in a green leather vest to obtain gentler handling for their
goods or more speed, not that it seemed possible the guildfolk
could move any faster. Southerners always seemed to move at a half
trot unless the sun was right overhead, when the heat here could
roast a duck, and with a gray sky and a cutting wind off the sea,
it would have been cold no matter where the sun stood.</p>

<p>By the time he was abreast of the Mol Hara, he had
counted more than twenty <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> patrolling the docks
with <em>damane</em>, poking their noses into boats leaving
anchored ships that were not Seanchan, boarding any vessel newly
arrived at the docks or, for that matter, ready to cast off lines.
He had been quite sure they would be there. It was going to have to
be Valan Luca. The only alternative was just too hazardous, except
in an emergency. Luca was chancy, too, but the only real choice
left.</p>

<p>Back at the Tarasin Palace, he climbed down off Pips
with a wince and pulled his walking staff out from behind the
saddle girth. Letting a groom take the bay, he limped inside, his
left leg barely able to support his weight. Maybe a soak in a hot
bath would take some of the pain. Maybe then he could think. Luca
had to be caught by surprise, but before it came to Luca, there
were a few other little problems to overcome.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, there you are,&rdquo; Noal said, popping up in front
of him. Mat had caught only glimpses of the old man since getting
him a bed, but he looked well-rested in his freshly brushed gray
coat, considering that he vanished into the city every day and only
returned to the Palace at night. Adjusting the bits of lace at his
cuffs, he smiled confidingly, revealing the gaps in his teeth. &ldquo;You
are planning something, Lord Mat, and I would like to offer my
services.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m planning to take the weight off my leg,&rdquo;
Mat said as casually as he could. Noal seemed harmless enough.
According to Harnan, he told stories before going to sleep, stories
that Harnan and the other Redarms seemed to swallow whole, even the
one about some place called Shibouya, supposedly beyond the Aiel
Waste, where women who could channel had tattooed faces, over three
hundred crimes carried a penalty of death, and giants lived under
the mountains, men taller than Ogier, with their faces on their
bellies. He claimed to have been there. No one who made claims like
that could be anything but harmless. On the other hand, the one
time Mat had seen him handle those long daggers he carried under
his coat, he had looked far from harmless. There was a way a man
had of touching a weapon that said he was accustomed to using it.
&ldquo;If I decide to plan anything else, I&rsquo;ll keep you in
mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still smiling, Noal tapped one of those crooked
fingers against the side of his beak of a nose. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
trust me, yet. That is understandable. Although, if I meant you any
harm, all I had to do was stand back that night in the alley. You
have the look in your eye. I&rsquo;ve seen great men laying plans,
and villains dark as the Pit of Doom, too. There is a look a man
gets, laying dangerous plans he doesn&rsquo;t want known.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My eyes are just tired,&rdquo; Mat laughed, leaning on his
staff. Great men laying plans? The old fellow had probably seen
them in Shibouya, with the giants. &ldquo;I do thank you for that alley,
you know. If there&rsquo;s ever anything more I can do for you, ask.
But right now, I am going to find a hot bath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does this <em>gholam</em> drink blood?&rdquo; Noal asked
catching Mat&rsquo;s arm as he started to hobble by.</p>

<p>Light, he wished he had not mentioned that name where
the old man could hear. He wished Birgitte had never told him about
the thing. &ldquo;Why do you ask?&rdquo; <em>Gholam</em> lived on blood. They
ate nothing else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was another man found with his throat torn
out, last night, only there was almost no blood on him or his
bedding. Did I mention? He was at an inn down near the Moldine
Gate. If that thing did leave the city, it&rsquo;s back.&rdquo; Glancing
beyond Mat, he made a low, elaborate bow to someone. &ldquo;If you change
your mind, I am always ready,&rdquo; he said in a lower voice when he
straightened.</p>

<p>Mat looked over his shoulder as the old man hurried
off. Tuon was standing beneath one of the gilded stand lamps,
watching him through her veil. Looking at him, at least. Glancing?
As always, the moment he saw her, she turned away and glided off
down the hall, her pleated white skirts rustling faintly. There was
no one with her, today.</p>

<p>For the second time that day, Mat shivered. A pity
the girl had not gone with Suroth and Tylin. A man given a loaf
should not complain that a few crumbs were missing, but Aes Sedai
and Seanchan, <em>gholam</em> stalking him and old men poking their
noses in and skinny girls staring at him was enough to give any man
the golliwogs. Maybe he should forget about wasting time soaking
his leg.</p>

<p>He felt better once he had sent Lopin to fetch the
rest of his own clothes from Beslan&rsquo;s toy cupboard. And Nerim
to find Juilin. His leg still hurt like fire and wobbled when he
wanted to walk, but if he was not going to waste time, then he
might as well get a move on about it. He wanted to be gone from
Ebou Dar before Tylin came back, and that gave him ten days. Less,
to be on the safe side.</p>

<p>When the thief-catcher stuck his head in at the
bedroom door, Mat was studying himself in Tylin&rsquo;s tall
stand-mirror. The red&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;garments&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;were tucked away in the
wardrobe with the rest of the gauds she had given him. Maybe
Tylin&rsquo;s next pretty could get some use of them. The coat he
had put on was the plainest he owned, a fine-woven blue wool
without a thread of embroidery. The sort of coat a man could be
proud to wear, without having everybody stare at him. A decent
coat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe a little lace,&rdquo; he muttered, fingering the
neck of his shirt. &ldquo;Just a little.&rdquo; It really was a very plain
coat, come to think. Almost sober.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about lace,&rdquo; Juilin said.
&ldquo;Is that why you wanted me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, of course not. What are you grinning at?&rdquo; The
fellow was not just grinning; his smile nearly split his dark face
in two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am happy, that&rsquo;s all. Suroth is gone, and I
am happy. If you don&rsquo;t want to ask me about lace, what do you
want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blood and bloody ashes! The woman he was interested
in must be one of Suroth&rsquo;s <em>da&rsquo;covale</em>! One she
had left behind. He certainly had no other reason to care whether
she was gone, much less be happy over it. And the man wanted to
take one of her property! Well, maybe that was not so much,
compared to taking a couple of <em>damane</em>.</p>

<p>Limping over to put an arm around Juilin&rsquo;s
shoulders, Mat walked him out into the sitting room. &ldquo;I need a <em>
damane</em> dress to fit a woman about so high,&rdquo; he held up a hand
just about his shoulder, &ldquo;and slender.&rdquo; He gave the fellow his most
sincere smile, but Juilin&rsquo;s own smile faded markedly. &ldquo;I need
three <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> dresses, too, and an <em>
a&rsquo;dam</em>. And it came to me that the man who knows best how
to steal something without getting caught would be a
thief-catcher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a thief-<em>catcher</em>,&rdquo; the man growled,
shaking off Mat&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;not a thief!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat let his own grin vanish. &ldquo;Juilin, you know the
only way to take those sisters out of the city is if the guards
think they&rsquo;re still <em>damane</em>. Teslyn and Edesina are
wearing what they need, but we have to disguise Joline. Suroth will
be back in ten days, Juilin. If we aren&rsquo;t gone by then, in all
likelihood your pretty will still be her property when we go.&rdquo; He
could not help feeling that if they were not gone by then, none of
them would be going. Light, a man could shiver himself to death
indoors in this city.</p>

<p>Stuffing his fists into the pockets of his dark
Tairen coat, Juilin glared at him. Glared through him, really, at
something the thief-catcher did not like. Finally he grimaced, and
muttered, &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be easy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The days that followed were anything but easy. The
serving women clucked and laughed over his new clothes. His old
clothes, that was. They grinned and made wagers where he could hear
over how fast he could change back when Tylin returned&mdash;most
seemed to think he would race through the halls ripping off
whatever he was wearing as soon he heard she was on her way&mdash;but he paid them no mind. Except for the part about Tylin
returning. The first time a serving woman mentioned it, he nearly
jumped out of his skin thinking she actually had for some
reason.</p>

<p>A number of the women and nearly all the men took his
change of clothing to mean he was leaving. Running away, they
called it disapprovingly, and did what they could to hamper him. In
their eyes, he was the ointment to soothe Tylin&rsquo;s aching
tooth, and they did not want her to come back and bite them for
losing it. If he had not made sure Lopin or Nerim was always in
Tylin&rsquo;s apartments guarding his belongings, the clothes would
have vanished again, and only Vanin and the Redarms kept Pips from
disappearing out of the stables.</p>

<p>Mat tried to encourage the belief. When he went and
two <em>damane</em> vanished at the same time, the events were sure
to be linked, but with Tylin gone and his intention to run away
plain before she returned, she would be safe from blame. Every day,
even when it rained, he rode Pips in circles in the stable, for a
longer time every day, as if trying to build up his stamina. Which
he actually was, he realized after a while. His leg and hip still
ached like fury, but he began to think he could manage as much as
ten miles before needing to climb down. Eight miles, anyway.</p>

<p>Often, if the sky was clear, <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>
were walking <em>damane</em> when he exercised. The Seanchan women
were aware he was not Tylin&rsquo;s property, but on the other hand,
he heard some call him her toy! Tylin&rsquo;s Toy, they said, as if
that was his name! He was not important enough for them to learn if
he had another. To them, someone was either <em>da&rsquo;covale</em>
or not, and this halfway business amused them no end. He rode to
the sound of <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> laughing, and tried to tell
himself it was all to the good. The more people who could tell that
he worked to flee before Tylin returned, the better for her. It
just was not very pleasant for him.</p>

<p>Now and then he saw Aes Sedai faces among the <em>
damane</em> being walked, three besides Teslyn, but he had not a
clue what Edesina looked like. She could have been the short pale
woman who reminded him of Moiraine, or the tall one with
silvery-golden hair, or the slender black-haired woman. Gilding
along beside a <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>, any of them might have been
taking a walk on her own, if not for the gleaming collar around her
neck and the leash tying her to the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>&rsquo;s
wrist. Teslyn herself looked increasingly grim every time he saw
her, staring fixedly straight ahead. Every time, there seemed to be
more determination on her face. And something that might have been
panic, too. He began to worry about her, and her impatience.</p>

<p>He wanted to reassure Teslyn&mdash;he did not need
those old memories to tell him that determination combined with
panic could get people killed, but they confirmed it&mdash;he
wanted to reassure her, only he dared not go near the kennels in
the attic again. Tuon continued to be there when he turned around,
looking at him or glancing or whatever she was doing, just too
often for comfort. Not enough to make him think she was following
him. Why would she do that? Just too often. Occasionally her <em>
so&rsquo;jhin</em> Selucia was with her, and now and then Anath,
though the strange tall woman seemed to vanish from the Palace
after a time, at least from the hallways. She was &ldquo;on retreat,&rdquo; he
heard, whatever that was supposed to mean, and he only wished she
had taken Tuon with her. He doubted the girl would believe he was
taking sweets to a Windfinder a second time. Maybe she still wanted
to buy him? If that was the case, he still could not understand
why. He had never been able to understand what attracted women to a
man&mdash;they seemed to go pop-eyed over the most ordinary
looking fellows&mdash;but he knew he was no beauty, no matter what
Tylin said. Women lied to get a man into bed, and they lied worse
once they had him there.</p>

<p>In any case, Tuon was a minor irritant. A fly on his
ear. No more than that. It took more than chattering women or
staring girls to make him sweat. Absent as she was, however, Tylin
did. If she came back and caught him preparing to leave, she might
change her mind about selling. She was a High Lady herself now,
after all, and he was sure she would shave her hair to a crest
before much longer. A proper Seanchan High Blood, and who knew what
she would do then? Tylin caused a little sweat, but there was more
than enough else to drench a man in it.</p>

<p>He continued to hear from Noal about the <em>
gholam</em>&rsquo;s murders, and sometimes from Thom. There was a
fresh one every night, though no one but those two and him seemed
to connect the killings. Mat kept to open places as much as he
could, with people around as often as possible. He stopped sleeping
in Tylin&rsquo;s bed, and never spent two nights running in the same
place. If that meant a night in a stable loft, well, he had slept
in haylofts before, although he did not recall hay sticking through
his clothes quite that sharply. Still, better stuck by hay than
having his throat torn out.</p>

<p>He had sought out Thom straight away after he decided
to try freeing Teslyn, and had found him in the kitchens chatting
with the cooks over a honey-glazed chicken. Thom got on as well
with cooks as he did with farmers and merchants and nobles. He had
a way of getting on with everyone, did Thom Merrilin, a way of
hearing everyone&rsquo;s gossip and fitting it together to make a
picture. He could look at things from a slant and see what others
missed. As soon as he finished the chicken, Thom had come up with
the only way to get the Aes Sedai past the guards. The whole thing
had almost seemed easy, then. For a very short while. But other
obstacles arose.</p>

<p>Juilin possessed the same sort of twisty way of
looking at things, perhaps from his years as thief-catcher, and
some nights Mat met with him and Thom in the tiny room the two men
shared in the servants&rsquo; quarters to try planning how to
overcome those obstacles. Those were what really made Mat
sweat.</p>

<p>At the first of those meetings, the night Tylin left,
Beslan barged in looking for Thom, so he said. Unfortunately, he
had listened at the door first, hearing enough that he could not be
foisted off with a story. Very unfortunately, he wanted to take
part. He even told them just how to do it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An uprising,&rdquo; he said, squatting on the three-legged
stool between the two narrow beds. A washstand with a chipped white
pitcher and bowl and no mirror finished crowding the room. Juilin
sat on the edge of one bed in his shirtsleeves, his face
unreadable, and Thom was stretched out on the other examining his
knuckles with a frown. That left Mat to lean against the door to
keep anyone else from barging in. He did not know whether to laugh
or cry. Plainly Thom had known about this madness all along; this
was what he had been trying to cool down. &ldquo;The people will rise
when I give the word,&rdquo; Beslan went on. &ldquo;My friends and I have
talked to men all over the city. They are ready to fight!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sighing, Mat eased his weight more onto his good leg.
He suspected that when Beslan gave the word, he and his friends
would rise alone. Most people were more willing to talk about
fighting than to do it, especially against soldiers. &ldquo;Beslan, in
gleeman&rsquo;s tales, grooms with pitchforks and bakers with
cobblestones defeat armies because they want to be free.&rdquo; Thom
snorted so hard, his long white mustache stirred. Mat ignored him.
&ldquo;In real life, the grooms and the bakers get killed. I know good
soldiers when I see them, and the Seanchan are very good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we free the <em>damane</em> along with the Aes
Sedai, they will fight beside us!&rdquo; Beslan insisted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There must be two hundred or more <em>damane</em> up
in the attic, Beslan, most of them Seanchan. Free them, and like as
not, every last one will run to find a <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>.
Light, we couldn&rsquo;t even trust all the women who aren&rsquo;t
Seanchan!&rdquo; Mat held up a hand to forestall Beslan&rsquo;s protest.
&ldquo;We have no way to find out which we can trust, and no time to. And
if we did, we&rsquo;d have to kill the rest. I&rsquo;m not up to
killing a woman whose only crime is that she&rsquo;s on a leash. Are
you?&rdquo; Beslan looked away, but his jaw was set. He was not giving
up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whether we free any <em>damane</em> or not,&rdquo; Mat
went on, &ldquo;if the people rise up, the Seanchan will turn Ebou Dar
into a slaughter yard. They put down rebellions hard, Beslan. Very
hard! We could kill every <em>damane</em> in the attic, and they
would bring in more from the camps. Your mother will come back to
find rubble inside the walls and your head stuck up outside them.
Where hers will soon join it. You don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll
believe she did not know what her own son was planning, do you?&rdquo;
Light, did she? The woman was brave enough to try it. He did not
think she was stupid enough, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She says we are mice,&rdquo; Beslan said bitterly. &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;When wolf-hounds pass by, mice lie quiet or get eaten,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; he quoted. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like being a mouse, Mat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat breathed a little more easily. &ldquo;Better a live
mouse than a dead one, Beslan.&rdquo; Which might not have been the most
diplomatic way to put it&mdash;Beslan grimaced at him&mdash;but
it was true.</p>

<p>He encouraged Beslan to join the meetings, if just to
keep a rein on him, but Beslan seldom came, and it fell to Thom to
try to cool the man&rsquo;s ardor when and as he could. The most he
could persuade Beslan to promise was that he could not call for the
rising until the rest of them had been gone a month, to let them
get clear. That was something settled, if not satisfactorily.
Everything else seemed to be take two steps and hit a stone wall.
Or a trip wire.</p>

<p>Juilin&rsquo;s lady love had quite a hold on him. For
her, he seemed to not to mind doffing his Tairen clothes for a
servant&rsquo;s green-and-white livery, or missing sleep to spend
two nights sweeping the floor not far from the stairs that led up
to the kennels. No one looked twice at a servant pushing a broom,
not even the other servants. The Tarasin Palace had enough of those
that they did not all know one another, and if they saw a man in
livery with a broom, they assumed he was supposed to be using it.
Juilin spent two whole days sweeping, too, and finally reported
that <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> inspected the kennels first thing in the
morning and just after dark, and might be in or out at any time of
the day between, but at night the <em>damane</em> were left to
themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I overheard a <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> say she was glad
she wasn&rsquo;t out in the camps where&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Lying stretched out
on his thin mattress, Juilin paused to yawn copiously behind his
hand. Thom was sitting on the edge of his bed, which left the stool
for Mat. It was better than standing, if not by much. Most people
would be asleep at that hour. &ldquo;Where she&rsquo;d have to stand guard
some nights,&rdquo; the thief-catcher continued when he could speak
again. &ldquo;Said she liked being able to let the <em>damane</em> sleep
all night, too, so they were all fresh come sunrise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So we must move at night,&rdquo; Thom murmured, fingering
his long white mustache. There was no need to add that anything
moving at night drew eyes. Seanchan patrolled the streets at night,
which the Civil Guard never had. The Guard had been amenable to
bribes, too, until the Seanchan disbanded them. Now, at night, it
was as likely to be the Deathwatch Guards in the street, and anyone
who tried to bribe them might not live to face trial.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you found an <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> yet, Juilin?&rdquo;
Mat asked. &ldquo;Or the dresses? Dresses can&rsquo;t be as difficult as
an <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Juilin yawned into his hand again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get
them when I get them. They don&rsquo;t just leave either lying
about, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom discovered that simply walking <em>damane</em>
through the gates was not possible. Or rather, as he freely
admitted, Riselle had discovered it. It seemed that one of the
high-ranking officers staying at The Wandering Woman had a singing
voice she found most entertaining.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the Blood can take <em>damane</em> out with
no questions asked,&rdquo; Thom said at their next meeting. This time, he
and Juilin both were sitting on their beds. Mat was beginning to
hate that stool. &ldquo;Or few enough, anyway. <em>Sul&rsquo;dam</em>,
though, need an order signed and sealed by one of the Blood, an
officer who&rsquo;s captain or above, or a <em>
der&rsquo;sul&rsquo;dam</em>. The guards at the gates and on the
docks have lists of every seal in the city that qualifies, so I
can&rsquo;t just make any sort of seal and think it will be
accepted. I need a copy of the right sort of order with the right
sort of seal. That leaves the question of who will be our three
<em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe Riselle will be one,&rdquo; Mat suggested. She did
not know what they were doing, and telling her would be a risk.
Thom had asked her all sorts of questions, as if he was trying to
learn about life under the Seanchan, and she had been happy enough
to ask her Seanchan friend, but she might not be happy enough to
chance her pretty head going up on a spike. She could do worse than
say no. &ldquo;And what about your lady love, Juilin?&rdquo; He had a thought
on the third. He had asked Juilin to find a <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>
dress that would fit Setalle Anan, though there had been no chance
to actually put it to her, yet. He had only been back to The
Wandering Woman once since Joline had walked into the kitchen, to
make sure she understood he was doing all he could. She did not,
but Mistress Anan had actually managed to smother the Aes
Sedai&rsquo;s anger before she could begin shouting. She would make
the perfect <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> for Joline.</p>

<p>Juilin shrugged uncomfortably. &ldquo;I had a hard enough
time convincing Thera to run away with me. She is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;timid, now.
I can help her overcome that, in time&mdash;I know I can&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t think she is up to anything like pretending to be
a <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom tugged at his mustaches. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unlikely
Riselle would leave under any circumstances. It seems she likes
Banner-General Lord Yamada&rsquo;s singing well enough that she has
decided to marry him.&rdquo; He sighed regretfully. &ldquo;There will be no
more information from that well, I fear.&rdquo; And no more pillowing his
head on her bosom, his expression said. &ldquo;Well, both of you think on
who we can ask. And see if you can lay hands on a copy of those
orders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom managed to find the proper inks and paper, and
was ready to imitate anyone&rsquo;s hand and seal. He was
contemptuous of seals; anyone with a turnip and a knife could copy
those, he said. Writing another man&rsquo;s hand so the man himself
would think he had written it was an art. But none of them were
able to find a copy of orders with the necessary seal to copy. Like
<em>a&rsquo;dam</em>, the Seanchan did not leave orders lying about.
Juilin seemed to making no progress with the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>,
either. Two steps forward, and a stone wall. And six days were
gone, just like that. Four left. To Mat, it felt as if six years
had passed since Tylin&rsquo;s departure, and four hours remained
till she came back.</p>

<p>On the seventh day, Thom stopped Mat in the hallway
as soon as he came in from his ride. Smiling as though making idle
conversation, the one-time gleeman pitched his voice low. The
servants hurrying past could not have heard more than a murmur.
&ldquo;According to Noal, the <em>gholam</em> killed again last night.
The Seekers have been ordered to find the killer if they have to
stop eating or sleeping to do it, though I can&rsquo;t find out who
gave the order. Even the fact that they have been ordered to do
anything seems to be a secret. They are practically readying the
rack and heating their irons already, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No matter that Thom&rsquo;s voice was low, Mat looked
around to see whether anyone was listening. The only person in
sight was a stout gray-haired man named Narvin, in livery but
neither hurrying nor carrying anything. Servants as high as Narvin
did not carry or hurry. He blinked at the sight of Mat trying to
look every direction at once, and frowned. Mat wanted to snarl, but
instead he grinned as disarmingly as he knew how, and Narvin went
off scowling. Mat was sure the fellow had been responsible for the
first attempt to remove Pips from the stable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Noal told you about the Seekers?&rdquo; he whispered
incredulously as soon as Narvin was far enough away.</p>

<p>Thom waved a lean hand dismissively. &ldquo;Of course not.
Just about the killing. Though he does seem to hear whispers, and
know what they mean. A rare talent, that. I wonder whether he
really has been to Shara,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;He said he&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Thom
cleared his throat under Mat&rsquo;s glare. &ldquo;Well, later for that. I
do have other resources than the much-lamented Riselle. Several of
them are Listeners. Listeners really do seem to hear
everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been talking to Listeners?&rdquo; Mat&rsquo;s
voice squeaked like a rusty hinge. He thought his throat might have
rusted solid!</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to it, as long as they
don&rsquo;t know you know,&rdquo; Thom chuckled. &ldquo;Mat, with Seanchan you
have to assume they are all Listeners. That way, you learn what you
want to know without saying the wrong thing in the wrong ear.&rdquo; He
coughed and knuckled his mustache, not quite hiding a smile so
self-deprecating it all but invited praise. &ldquo;I just happen to know
two or three who really are. In any case, more information never
hurts. You do want to be gone before Tylin returns, don&rsquo;t you?
You seem to looking a little&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;forlorn&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;with her
gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat could only groan.</p>

<p>That night, the <em>gholam</em> struck again. Lopin
and Nerim were bubbling over with the news before Mat had finished
his breakfast fish. The whole city was in an uproar, they claimed.
The latest victim, a woman, had been discovered at the mouth of an
alley, and suddenly people were talking, putting together one
killing with another. There was a madman on the loose, and the
people were demanding more Seanchan patrols on the streets at
night. Mat pushed his plate away, all hunger gone. More patrols.
And if that were not bad enough, Suroth might come back early if
she learned of this, bringing Tylin with her. At best, he could
only count on two more days. He thought he might lose what
he&rsquo;d already eaten.</p>

<p>He spent the rest of the morning pacing&mdash;well,
limping&mdash;up and down the carpet in Tylin&rsquo;s bedchamber,
ignoring the pain in his leg while he tried to think of something,
anything, that would let him carry out the impossible in two days.
The pain really was less. He had given up the walking stick,
pushing himself to regain strength. He thought he might manage two
or three miles on foot without needing to rest the leg. Without
resting it very much, anyway.</p>

<p>At midday, Juilin brought him the only really good
news he had heard in an Age. It was not news, exactly. It was a
cloth sack containing two dresses wrapped around the silver length
of an <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>.</p>
