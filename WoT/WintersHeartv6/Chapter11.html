<h4><em>Ideas of Importance</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">W</span>ithout
even taking a look, Rand stepped through the
gateway into a large dark room. The strain of holding the weave, of
fighting <em>saidin</em>, made him sway; he wanted to gag, to
double over and spew up everything in him. Holding himself upright
was an effort. A little light crept through cracks between the
shutters on a few small windows set high in one wall, just enough
to see by with the Power in him. Furniture and large cloth-covered
shapes nearly filled the room, interspersed with wide barrels of
the sort used to store crockery, chests of all shapes and sizes,
boxes and crates and knickknacks. Little more than walkways a pace
or two wide remained clear. He had been sure he would not find
servants hunting for something, or cleaning up. The highest floor
of the Royal Palace had several such storerooms, looking like the
attics of huge farmhouses and just about forgotten. Besides, he was
<em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, after all. A good thing no one had been
there when the gateway opened. One edge of it had sliced the corner
off an empty chest bound in cracked, rotting leather, and the other
had taken a glass-smooth shaving down the length of a long, inlaid
table stacked with vases and wooden boxes. Maybe some Queen of
Andor had eaten at that table, a century or two gone.</p>

<p><em>A century or two</em>, Lews Therin laughed
thickly in his head. <em>A very long time. For the love of the
Light, let go! This is the Pit of Doom!</em> The voice dwindled as
the man fled into the recesses of Rand&rsquo;s mind.</p>

<p>For once, he had his own reasons to listen to Lews
Therin&rsquo;s complaints. Hastily he motioned Min to follow him
from the forest clearing on the other side of the gateway, and as
soon as she did, he let it close behind her in a quick vertical
slash of light by releasing <em>saidin</em>. Blessedly, the nausea
went with it. His head still spun a little, but he did not feel as
if he were going to vomit or fall over or both. The feel of filth
remained, though, the Dark One&rsquo;s taint oozing into him from
the weaves he had tied off around himself. Shifting the strap of
his leather scrip from one shoulder to the other, he tried to use
the motion to hide wiping sweat from his face with his sleeve. He
did not have to worry about Min noticing after all, however.</p>

<p>Her blue, heeled boots stirred the dust on the floor
at her first step, and her second made it rise. She pulled a
lace-edged handkerchief from her coatsleeve just in time to catch a
violent sneeze, followed by a second and third, each worse than the
last. He wished she had been willing to stay in a dress.
Embroidered white flowers decorated the sleeves and lapels of her
blue coat, and paler blue breeches molded her legs snugly. With
yellow-embroidered bright blue riding gloves tucked behind her
belt, and a cloak edged with yellow scrollwork and held by a golden
pin in the shape of a rose, she did look as if she had arrived by
more normal means, but she would draw every eye. He was in coarse
brown woolens any laborer might wear. Most places in the last few
days, he had been blatant with his presence; this time he did not
want just to be gone before anyone knew he had been here, he did
not want anyone but a special few to ever know he had been.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you grinning at me and thumbing your ear
like a loobie?&rdquo; she demanded, stuffing the handkerchief back into
her sleeve. Suspicion filled her big, dark eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just thinking how beautiful you are,&rdquo; he said
quietly. She was. He could not look at her without thinking so. Or
without regretting that he was too weak to send her away to
safety.</p>

<p>She drew a deep breath, and sneezed before she could
even clap a hand over her mouth, then glared at him as if it were
somehow his fault. &ldquo;I abandoned my horse for you, Rand
al&rsquo;Thor. I curled my hair for you. I gave up my <em>life</em>
for you! I will <em>not</em> give up my coat and breeches! Besides,
no one here has ever seen me in a dress for more time than it took
me to change out of it. You know this won&rsquo;t work unless
I&rsquo;m recognized. You certainly can&rsquo;t pretend you wandered
in off the street with that face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unthinking, he ran a hand across his jaw, feeling his
own face, but that was not what Min saw. Anyone looking at him
would see a man inches shorter and years older than Rand
al&rsquo;Thor, with lank black hair, dull brown eyes and a wart on
his bulbous nose. Only someone who touched him could pierce the
Mask of Mirrors. Even an Asha&rsquo;man would not see it, with the
weaves inverted. Though if there were Asha&rsquo;man in the Palace,
it might mean his plans had gone further awry than he believed.
This visit could not, must not, come to killing. In any case, she
was right; it was not a face that would have been allowed into the
Royal Palace of Andor unescorted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As long as we can finish this and be gone quickly,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Before anyone has time to think that if you&rsquo;re here,
maybe I am, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand,&rdquo; she said, her voice soft, and he eyed her
warily. Resting a hand on his chest, she looked up at him with a
serious expression. &ldquo;Rand, you really need to see Elayne. And
Aviendha, I suppose; you know she&rsquo;s probably here, too. If you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shook his head, and wished he had not. The
dizziness had still not gone completely. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he said curtly.
Light! No matter what Min said, he just could not believe that
Elayne and Aviendha <em>both</em> loved him. Or that the fact they
did, if it was a fact, did not upset her. Women were not <em>
that</em> strange! Elayne and Aviendha had reason to hate him, not
love him, and Elayne, at least, had made herself clear. Worse, he
was in love with both of them, as well as with Min! He had to be as
hard as steel, but he thought he might shatter if he had to face
all three at once. &ldquo;We find Nynaeve and Mat, and go, as fast as we
can.&rdquo; She opened her mouth, but he gave her no chance to speak.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t argue with me, Min. This is no time for it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tilting her head to one side, Min put on a small,
amused smile. &ldquo;When do I ever argue with you? Don&rsquo;t I always
do exactly as you tell me?&rdquo; If that lie were not bad enough, she
added, &ldquo;I was going to say, if you want to hurry, why are we
standing in this dusty storeroom all day?&rdquo; For punctuation, she
sneezed again.</p>

<p>She was the least likely to cause comment, even
dressed as she was, so she put her head out of the room first.
Apparently the storeroom was not entirely forgotten; the heavy
door&rsquo;s hinges barely creaked. A quick look both ways, and she
hurried out, gesturing him to follow. <em>Ta&rsquo;veren</em> or no,
he was relieved to find the long corridor empty. The most timid
servant might have wondered at seeing them emerge from a storeroom
in the upper reaches of the Palace. Still, they would encounter
people soon enough. The Royal Palace did not run as heavily to
servants as the Sun Palace or the Stone of Tear, but there were
still hundreds of them in a place this size. Walking along beside
Min, he tried to shamble and gawk at bright tapestries and carved
wall panels and polished highchests. None were so fine this high as
they would be lower down, but a common workman would gawk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We need to get down to a lower floor as fast as we
can,&rdquo; he murmured. There was still no one in sight, but there might
be ten people around the next corner. &ldquo;Remember, just ask the first
servant we see where to find Nynaeve and Mat. Don&rsquo;t elaborate
unless you have to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, thank you for reminding me, Rand. I knew
something had slipped my mind, and I just couldn&rsquo;t imagine
what.&rdquo; Her brief smile was much too tight, and she muttered
something under her breath.</p>

<p>Rand sighed. This was too important for her to play
games, but she was going to, if he let her. Not that she saw it
that way. Sometimes, though, her ideas of important differed widely
from his. Very widely. He would have to keep a close eye on
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Mistress Farshaw,&rdquo; a woman&rsquo;s voice said
behind them. &ldquo;It is Mistress Farshaw, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The scrip swung and thumped Rand&rsquo;s back heavily
as he spun around. The plump graying woman staring at Min in
astonishment was perhaps the last person he wanted to meet, besides
Elayne or Aviendha. Wondering why she was wearing a red tabard with
the White Lion large on the front, he slouched and avoided looking
at her directly. Just a workman doing his job. No reason to glance
at him twice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mistress Harfor?&rdquo; Min exclaimed, beaming
delightedly. &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s me. And you are just the woman I was
looking for. I&rsquo;m afraid I am lost. Can you tell me where to
find Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara? And Mat Cauthon? This fellow has
something Nynaeve asked him to deliver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The First Maid frowned slightly at Rand before
returning her attention to Min. She raised an eyebrow at Min&rsquo;s
garments, or maybe at the dust on them, but she mentioned neither.
&ldquo;Mat Cauthon? I don&rsquo;t believe I know him. Unless he&rsquo;s one
of the new servants or Guardsmen?&rdquo; she added doubtfully. &ldquo;As for
Nynaeve Sedai, she&rsquo;s very busy. I suppose it will be all right
with her if I accept whatever it is and put it in her room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand jerked upright. Nynaeve <em>Sedai</em>? Why
would the others&mdash;the real Aes Sedai&mdash;let her play at
that still? And Mat was not here? Had never been here, apparently.
Colors whirled in his head, almost an image he could make out. In a
heartbeat it vanished, but he staggered. Mistress Harfor frowned at
him again, and sniffed. Likely she thought him drunk.</p>

<p>Min frowned, too, but in thought, tapping a finger on
her chin, and that only lasted a moment. &ldquo;I think Nynaeve&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Sedai wants to see him.&rdquo; The hesitation was barely noticeable.
&ldquo;Could you have him shown to her rooms, Mistress Harfor? I have
another errand before I go. You mind your manners, now, Nuli, and
do as you&rsquo;re told. There&rsquo;s a good fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand opened his mouth, but before he could get out a
word she darted away down the corridor, almost running. Her cloak
flared behind her, she was moving so quickly. Burn her, she was
going to try finding Elayne! She could ruin everything!</p>

<p><em>Your plans fail because you want to live,
madman</em>. Lews Therin&rsquo;s voice was a rough, sweaty whisper.
<em>Accept that you are dead. Accept it, and stop tormenting me,
madman!</em> Rand suppressed the voice to a muted buzz, a biteme
buzzing in the darkness of his head. Nuli? What kind of name was
Nuli?</p>

<p>Mistress Harfor gaped after Min until she vanished
around a corner, then gave her tabard an adjusting tug it did not
need. She turned her disapproval on Rand. Even with the Mask of
Mirrors she saw a man who towered over her, but Reene Harfor was
not a woman to let a small thing like that put her off stride for
an instant. &ldquo;I mistrust the looks of you, Nuli,&rdquo; she said, her
eyebrows drawn down sharply, &ldquo;so you watch your step. You&rsquo;ll
watch it very carefully, if you have any brain at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Holding the scrip&rsquo;s shoulder strap with one
hand, he tugged his forelock with the other. &ldquo;Yes, Mistress,&rdquo; he
muttered gruffly. The First Maid might recognize his real voice.
Min had been supposed to do all the talking until they found
Nynaeve and Mat. What in the Light was he going to do if she did
bring Elayne? And maybe Aviendha. She probably was here, too.
Light! &ldquo;Pardon, Mistress, but we ought to hurry. It&rsquo;s urgent I
see Nynaeve as soon as possible.&rdquo; He hefted the scrip slightly.
&ldquo;She wanted this real important like.&rdquo; If he was done when Min
returned, he might be able to get away with her before he had to
face the other two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Nynaeve <em>Sedai</em> thought it was urgent,&rdquo;
the plump woman told him tartly, placing heavy emphasis on the
honorific he had omitted, &ldquo;she would have left word you were
expected. Now, follow me, and keep your comments and opinions to
yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She started off without waiting for a reply, without
looking back, gliding along with a stately grace. After all, what
could he do except as he had been told? As he recalled, the First
Maid was accustomed to everyone doing as they were told. Striding
to catch up, he took only one step at her side before her startled
look made him drop back, tugging his forelock and mumbling
apologies. He was not used to having to walk behind anyone. It was
not calculated to moderate his mood. The tag end of dizziness hung
on, too, and the filth of the taint. He seemed to be in a foul mood
more often than not of late, unless Min was with him.</p>

<p>Before they had gone very far, liveried servants
began to appear in the hallway, polishing and dusting and carrying,
scurrying every which way. Plainly the absence of people when he
and Min left the storeroom was a rare occurrence. <em>
Ta&rsquo;veren</em> again. Down a flight of narrow service stairs
built into the wall, and there were even more. And something else,
a great many women who were not in livery. Copper-skinned Domani
women, short pale Cairhienin, women with olive skins and dark eyes
who were certainly not Andoran. They made him smile, a tight
satisfied smile. None had what he could call an ageless face, and a
number even bore lines and wrinkles that never decorated any Aes
Sedai&rsquo;s face, but sometimes goose bumps danced on his skin
when he came near one of them. They were channeling, or least
holding <em>saidar</em>. Mistress Harfor led him past closed doors
where that prickling raced, too. Behind those doors, still other
women had to be channeling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon, Mistress,&rdquo; he said in the coarse voice he
had adopted for Nuli. &ldquo;How many Aes Sedai are there in the
Palace?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is no concern of yours,&rdquo; she snapped. Glancing
over one shoulder at him, though, she sighed and relented. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t suppose there is any harm in you knowing. Five, counting
the Lady Elayne and Nynaeve Sedai.&rdquo; A touch of pride entered her
voice. &ldquo;It has been a long time since that many Aes Sedai claimed
guestright here at one time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand could have laughed, though without amusement.
Five? No, that included Nynaeve and Elayne. Three real Aes Sedai.
Three! Whoever the rest were did not really matter. He had begun to
believe that the rumors of hundreds of Aes Sedai moving toward
Caemlyn with an army meant there really might be that many ready to
follow the Dragon Reborn. Instead, even his original hope for a
double handful of them had been wildly optimistic. The rumors were
only rumors. Or else some scheme of Elaida&rsquo;s making. Light,
where <em>was</em> Mat? Color flashed in his head&mdash;for an
instant he thought it was Mat&rsquo;s face&mdash;and he
stumbled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you came here drunk, Nuli,&rdquo; Mistress Harfor said
firmly, &ldquo;you will leave regretting it bitterly. I will see to it
myself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mistress,&rdquo; Rand muttered, jerking at his
forelock. Inside his head, Lews Therin cackled in mad, weeping
laughter. He had had to come here&mdash;it was necessary&mdash;but he was already beginning to regret it.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Surrounded by the light of <em>saidar</em>, Nynaeve
and Talaan faced one another at four paces in front of the
fireplace, where a brisk blaze had managed to take all chill out of
the air. Or maybe it was effort that had warmed her, Nynaeve
thought sourly. This lesson had lasted an hour already, by the
ornate clock on the carved mantel. An hour of channeling without
rest would warm anyone. Sareitha was supposed to be here, not her,
but the Brown had slipped out of the Palace leaving a note about an
urgent errand in the city. Careane had refused to take two days in
a row, and Vandene still refused to take any, on the ridiculous
grounds that teaching Kirstian and Zarya left her no time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like this,&rdquo; she said, whipping her flow of Spirit
around the boy-slim Sea Folk apprentice&rsquo;s attempt at fending
her off. Adding the force of her own flow, she pushed the
girl&rsquo;s further away and at the same time channeled Air in
three separate weaves. One tickled Talaan&rsquo;s ribs through her
blue linen blouse. A simple ploy, but the girl gasped in surprise,
and for an instant her embrace of the Source lessened just a hair,
the faintest flicker in the Power filling her. In that heartbeat
Nynaeve stopped the pushing she had just begun on the other&rsquo;s
flow and snapped her own back to its original target. Forcing the
shield onto Talaan still felt much like slapping a wall&mdash;except the sting was spread evenly across her skin rather than just
in her palm, hardly an improvement&mdash;but the glow of <em>
saidar</em> vanished just as the last two flows of Air trapped
Talaan&rsquo;s arms at her sides and pulled her knees together in
their wide, dark trousers.</p>

<p>Very neatly done, if Nynaeve did think so herself.
The girl was very agile, very deft with her weaves. Besides, trying
to shield someone who held the Power was chancy at best and futile
at worst, unless you were <em>very</em> much stronger than they&mdash;sometimes if you were&mdash;and Talaan matched her as
closely as made no difference. That helped keep a satisfied smile
from her face. It seemed a very short time ago that sisters had
been startled at her strength and believed that only some of the
Forsaken possessed greater. Talaan had not slowed, yet; she was
little more than a child. Fifteen? Maybe younger! The Light alone
knew what her potential was. At least, none of the Windfinders had
mentioned it, and Nynaeve was not about to ask. She had no interest
in knowing how much stronger than she a Sea Folk girl was going to
be. None at all.</p>

<p>Bare feet shuffling on the patterned green carpet,
Talaan made one futile attempt to break the shield that Nynaeve
held easily, then sighed in defeat and lowered her eyes. Even when
she had succeeded in following Nynaeve&rsquo;s instruction, she
behaved as if she had failed, and now she slumped so dejectedly you
might have thought the weaves of Air were all that held her
upright.</p>

<p>Letting her flows dissipate, Nynaeve adjusted her
shawl and opened her mouth to tell Talaan what she had done wrong.
And to point out&mdash;once again&mdash;that it was useless to
try breaking free unless you were <em>much</em> stronger than
whoever had shielded you. The Sea Folk hardly seemed to believe
anything she told them until she told them ten times and showed
them twenty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She used your own force against you,&rdquo; Senine din
Ryal said bluntly before Nynaeve could speak. &ldquo;And distraction,
again. It is like wrestling, girl. You know how to wrestle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try again,&rdquo; Zaida commanded with a brisk gesture of
one dark, tattooed hand.</p>

<p>All of the chairs in the room had been moved against
the wall, though there was no real need for a clear space, and
Zaida sat watching the lesson flanked by six Windfinders, a riot of
reds and yellows and blues in brocaded silks and brightly dyed
linens, a flinch-inducing display of earrings and nose rings and
medallion-laden chains. That was always the way; one of the two
apprentices was used for the actual lesson&mdash;or Merilille,
Nynaeve had heard, actually forced to take the part of an
apprentice unless she herself was teaching&mdash;while Zaida and
one group or another of Windfinders watched. The Wavemistress could
not channel, of course, though she was always present, and none of
the Windfinders would actually stoop to participating personally.
Oh, never that.</p>

<p>In Nynaeve&rsquo;s estimation, today&rsquo;s grouping
was very odd, considering the Sea Folks&rsquo; obsession with rank.
Zaida&rsquo;s own Windfinder, Shielyn, sat on her right, a slender,
coolly reserved woman almost as tall as Aviendha and towering over
Zaida. That was proper, as far as Nynaeve understood, but at
Zaida&rsquo;s left was Senine, and she served on a soarer, one of
the Sea Folk&rsquo;s smaller vessels, and hers among the smallest of
those. Of course, the weathered woman, with her creased face and
hair thick with gray, had worn more than her present six earrings
in the past, and more golden medallions on the chain across her
dark left cheek. She had been Windfinder to the Mistress of the
Ships before Nesta din Reas was elected to the post, but by their
law, when the Mistress of the Ships or a Wavemistress died, her
Windfinder had to begin again at the lowest level. There was more
to it than respect for Senine&rsquo;s former position, though,
Nynaeve was certain. Rainyn, an apple-cheeked young woman who also
served on a soarer, occupied the chair next to Senine, and
stone-faced, flat-eyed Kurin sat beside Shielyn like a black
carving. This relegated Caire and Tebreille to the outermost
chairs, and they were both Windfinders to Wavemistresses
themselves, with four fat earrings in each ear and nearly as many
medallions as Zaida herself. Perhaps it was just to keep the
haughty-eyed sisters apart, though. They hated one another with a
passion only blood kin could achieve. Perhaps that was it.
Understanding the Atha&rsquo;an Miere was worse than trying to
understand men. A woman could go mad trying.</p>

<p>Muttering to herself, Nynaeve gave her shawl a jerk
and pre pared herself, readying her flows. The pure joy of holding
<em>saidar</em> could hardly compete with her vexation. Try again,
Nynaeve. One more time, Nynaeve. Do it now, Nynaeve. At least
Renaile was not there. Often they wanted her to teach things she
did not know as well as others&mdash;too often, things she barely
knew at all, she admitted reluctantly; she had not really had much
training in the Tower&mdash;and whenever she fumbled in the
slightest, Renaile positively delighted in making her sweat. The
others made her sweat, too, but they did not seem to take so much
pleasure in it. Anyway, after a solid hour, she was tired. Drat
Sareitha and her errand!</p>

<p>She struck out again, but this time Talaan&rsquo;s
flow of Spirit met hers much more lightly than she expected, and
her own flow swept the other further aside than she had meant.
Abruptly six weaves of Air shot out from the girl, darting toward
Nynaeve, and Nynaeve quickly sliced them with Fire. The severed
flows snapped back into Talaan, jolting her visibly, but before
they had vanished properly, six more appeared, faster than before.
Nynaeve slashed. And gaped as Talaan&rsquo;s weave of Spirit
flickered around hers and wrapped around her, cutting off <em>
saidar</em>. She was shielded! Talaan had shielded her! For the
final indignity, flows of Air pinioned her arms and legs tightly,
crushing her skirts. If she had not been so upset at Sareitha, it
never would have happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The girl has her,&rdquo; Caire said, sounding surprised.
No one would think she was Talaan&rsquo;s mother by the cold look
she gave her. Indeed, Talaan seemed embarrassed by her own success,
releasing the flows immediately and dropping her eyes to the
floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good, Talaan,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, since no one else
was offering a word of praise or encouragement. Irritably she shook
out her shawl behind her and settled it into the crooks of her
elbows. No need to tell the girl she had been lucky. She was quick,
true, but Nynaeve was not sure she herself could keep channeling
much longer. She certainly was not at her best now. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid that is all the time I have today, so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try again,&rdquo; Zaida commanded, leaning forward
intently. &ldquo;I want to see something.&rdquo; That was not an explanation,
or anything near apology, simply a statement of fact. Zaida never
explained or apologized. She just expected obedience.</p>

<p>Nynaeve considered telling the woman she could not
see anything they were doing anyway, but she rejected the thought
immediately. Not with six Windfinders in the room. Two days earlier
she had voiced her opinions freely, and she certainly did not want
a repeat of that. She had tried thinking of it as a penance, for
speaking without thinking, but that did not help very much. She
wished she had never taught them to link.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One more time,&rdquo; she said tightly, turning back to
Talaan, &ldquo;and then I must go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was ready for the girl&rsquo;s trick this time.
Channeling, she met Talaan&rsquo;s weave more dexterously, and
without so much force. The girl smiled at her uncertainly. Thinking
Nynaeve would not be distracted by extraneous flows of Air this
time, was she? Talaan&rsquo;s weave began to curl around hers, and
she nimbly spun her own to catch it. She would be ready when the
woman produced her flows of Air. Or maybe not Air, this time.
Nothing dangerous surely. This was practice. Only, Talaan&rsquo;s
flow of Spirit did not complete that curl, and Nynaeve&rsquo;s swung
wide while Talaan&rsquo;s struck straight at her and latched on.
Once again, <em>saidar</em> winked out of her, and bonds of Air
snapped her arms to her sides, fastened her knees.</p>

<p>Carefully, she drew breath. She would have to
congratulate the young woman. There was no getting out of it. If
she had had a hand free, she would have yanked her braid right out
of her scalp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; Zaida commanded, rising to stride gracefully
toward Nynaeve, her red silk trousers whisking softly above her
bare feet, intricately knotted red sash swaying against her thigh.
The Windfinders stood with her and followed, in order of rank.
Caire and Tebreille icily ignored one another as they hurried to
take places nearest the Wavemistress while Senine and Rainyn fell a
pace to the rear.</p>

<p>Obediently, Talaan held the shield on Nynaeve, and
the bonds, leaving her standing like a statue. And fuming like a
kettle too long on the boil. She refused to shuffle about, a broken
puppet, and that was all that was left to her except standing
still. Caire and Tebreille studied her with icy disdain, Kurin with
the hard contempt she had for all land dwellers. The stone-eyed
woman did not sneer or grimace or wear any real expression at all,
but you could not be with her long without becoming aware of her
opinion. Only Rainyn displayed the smallest touch of sympathy, a
slight rueful smile.</p>

<p>Zaida&rsquo;s eyes met Nynaeve&rsquo;s levelly. They
were much the same height. &ldquo;She is held as tightly as you can,
apprentice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Talaan bowed deeply, parallel to the floor, touching
her forehead, lips and heart. &ldquo;As you commanded, Wavemistress,&rdquo; she
all but whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo; Nynaeve demanded. &ldquo;Let
me go. You may get away with treating Merilille this way, but if
you think for one minute&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say there is no way to break this shield unless
you are much stronger,&rdquo; Zaida cut her off. Her tone was not harsh,
but she meant to be heard, not to listen. &ldquo;The Light willing, we
will learn whether you told us correctly. It is well known how Aes
Sedai make truth spin like a whirlpool. Windfinders, you will form
a circle. Kurin, you will lead. If she does break free, see that
she causes no harm. For incentive&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Apprentice, prepare to turn
her upside down at my count of five. One.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The light of <em>saidar</em> enveloped the
Windfinders, all of them together, as they linked. Kurin stood with
her feet apart and her hands on her hips, as if balancing on the
deck of a ship. Her very lack of expression seemed to convey that
she was already convinced they would uncover prevarication if not
an outright lie. Talaan drew a deep breath, and for once stood very
straight, not even blinking as she kept her anxious eyes on
Zaida.</p>

<p>Nynaeve blinked. No! They could not do this to her!
Not again! &ldquo;I am telling you,&rdquo; she said, much more calmly than she
felt, &ldquo;there is no way for me to break the shield. Talaan is too
strong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two,&rdquo; Zaida said, folding her arms beneath her
breasts and staring at Nynaeve as though she really could see the
weaves.</p>

<p>Nynaeve pushed tentatively at the shield. She might
as well push at a stone wall for all the give in it. &ldquo;Listen to me,
Za&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Wavemistress.&rdquo; There was certainly no need to
antagonize the woman further. They were sticklers for proper forms
of address. Sticklers for all too many things. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure
Merilille has told you something about shielding, at least. She
swore the Three Oaths. She <em>can&rsquo;t</em> lie.&rdquo; Maybe Egwene
was right about the Oath Rod.</p>

<p>Zaida&rsquo;s gaze never wavered, her expression never
changed. &ldquo;Three.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, not caring at all if
she sounded a bit desperate. Maybe more than just a bit. She pushed
against the shield harder, then as hard as she could. She might as
well have beat her head against a boulder for all the effect it
had. Instinctively, uselessly, she struggled in the bonds of Air
holding her, the fringe and loose folds of her shawl dancing around
her. She had as much chance of breaking free of those bonds as she
did of breaking through the shield, but she could not stop herself.
Not again! She could not face that! &ldquo;You have to listen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No! No! Not again! Frantically she scrabbled at the
shield. It might be as hard as stone, but it felt more like glass,
sleek and slippery. She could feel the Source beyond it, almost see
the Source, like light and warmth just beyond the corner of vision.
In desperation, panting, she felt her way across the smooth
surface. It had an edge, like a circle at once small enough to hold
in her hands and large enough to cover the world, but when she
attempted to slip around that edge, she found herself right back in
the center of the slick hard circle again. This was useless. She
had learned all this long ago, tried it all long ago. Her heart
pounded fit to burst out of her ribs. Struggling vainly for calm,
she hurriedly felt her way back to the edge, felt along it without
trying to go around. There was one place where it felt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;softer. She had never noticed that before. The soft point&mdash;a
slight lump?&mdash;seemed no different in any other way from the
rest, and it was not much softer, but she hurled herself at it. And
found herself back in the center. In a frenzy, she flung all of her
strength at the soft spot, again and again, being hurled back to
the center, not even pausing before launching herself at it again.
Again. Oh, Light! Please! She had to, before&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!</p>

<p>Abruptly she realized that Zaida still had not said
five. Gulping air as if she had run ten miles, she stared. Sweat
rolled down her face, her back. It trickled between her breasts,
slid down her belly. Her legs wobbled. The Wavemistress looked
straight into her eyes, thoughtfully tapping full lips with a slim
finger. The glow still enveloped the circle of six, Kurin still
could have been a scornfully stony statue, but Zaida had not said
five.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she truly try as hard as it seemed, Kurin,&rdquo; the
Wavemistress asked finally, &ldquo;or was all that thrashing about and
whimpering just a show?&rdquo; Nynaeve tried to summon an indignant
glare. She had <em>not</em> whimpered! Had she? Her scowl, such as
it was, made no more impression on Zaida than rain on a rock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With that much effort, Wavemistress,&rdquo; Kurin said
reluctantly, &ldquo;she could have carried a raker on her back.&rdquo; The flat
black pebbles of her eyes still held contempt, though. Only those
who lived at sea got any respect from her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Release her, Talaan,&rdquo; Zaida commanded, and shield
and bonds vanished as she turned away, starting back toward the
chairs without another glance at Nynaeve. &ldquo;Windfinders, I will have
words with you after she goes. I will see you at the same hour
tomorrow, Nynaeve Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Smoothing her rumpled skirts and irritably shaking
out her shawl again, Nynaeve attempted to regather a little
dignity. It was not easy, sweat-slicked and trembling. She <em>
certainly</em> had not whimpered! She tried not to look at the
woman who had shielded her. Twice! Standing there meek as butter,
with her eyes fixed on the carpet. Ha! Nynaeve jerked her shawl
around her shoulders. &ldquo;Sareitha Sedai will take her turn tomorrow,
Wavemistress.&rdquo; At least her voice was steady. &ldquo;I will be busy until&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your instruction is more edifying than that of the
others,&rdquo; Zaida said, still not bothering to look at her. &ldquo;At the
same hour, or I will send your pupils to bring you. You may leave
now.&rdquo; And that had the sound of you <em>will</em> leave now.</p>

<p>With an effort, Nynaeve swallowed her arguments. They
had a bitter taste. More edifying? What did that mean? She did not
think she really wanted to know.</p>

<p>Until she actually left the room, she was still the
teacher&mdash;the Sea Folk were rigid in their rules; Nynaeve
supposed that lax rules on ships could lead to trouble, but she
wished they would realize they were not on a ship&mdash;she was
still the teacher, and that meant she could not simply stalk out,
however much she wanted to. Worse, their rules were quite specific
about teachers from among the shorebound. She could simply have
refused to cooperate, she supposed, but if she violated their
bargain by a hair, these women would spread it from Tear to the
Light knew where! The whole world would know that Aes Sedai had
broken their word. What <em>that</em> would do to Aes Sedai
standing did not bear thinking about. Blood and bloody ashes!
Egwene <em>was</em> right, and burn her for it!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Wavemistress, for allowing me to instruct
you,&rdquo; she said, bowing and touching fingers to forehead, lips and
heart. Not a very deep bow, but a quick bob was all they were
getting today. Well, two. The Windfinders had to have one. &ldquo;Thank
you, Windfinders, for allowing me to instruct you.&rdquo; The sisters who
finally went to the Atha&rsquo;an Miere would explode when they
learned that their pupils could tell them what to teach and when,
and even order what they did when <em>not</em> teaching. On a Sea
Folk vessel, a land-dwelling teacher outranked the common
deckhands, but only just. And the sisters would not even get the
fat purses of gold used to lure other teachers on board.</p>

<p>Zaida and the Windfinders reacted very much as if the
lowest deckhand had announced her departure. That is, they stood in
a silent cluster, plainly waiting for her to go, and not very
patient about it. Only Rainyn favored her with as much as a glance.
An impatient glance. She was a Windfinder, after all was said and
done. Talaan still stood where she had been left, a meek figure
gazing at the carpet in front of her bare feet.</p>

<p>Head high and back straight, Nynaeve left the room
with every shred of dignity she could wrap around herself. Sweaty,
rumpled shreds. In the hall, she seized the door in both hands and
slammed it as hard as she could. The great, echoing crash was very
satisfying. She could always say it had slipped out of her hands,
if anyone complained. It really had, once she got a good swing
going.</p>

<p>Turning from the door, she dusted her hands with
satisfaction. And gave a start at who was waiting in the corridor
for her.</p>

<p>In a simple dark blue dress provided by one of the
Kinswomen, Alivia did not look at all unusual at first glance, a
woman a little taller than Nynaeve, with fine lines at the corners
of her blue eyes and threads of white in her golden yellow hair.
Those blue eyes crackled with intensity, though, like the eyes of a
hawk focused on prey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mistress Corly sent me to tell you she&rsquo;d like
to see you at dinner tonight,&rdquo; the blue-eyed hawk said in a slow
Seanchan drawl. &ldquo;Mistress Karistovan, Mistress Arman, and Mistress
Juarde will be there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here alone?&rdquo; Nynaeve demanded.
She wished she could be like most other sisters, aware of another
woman&rsquo;s strength without ever really thinking about it, but
that was something else she had not had time to learn. Maybe some
of the Forsaken topped Alivia, but surely no one else. And she was
Seanchan. Nynaeve wished there was someone else there besides the
two of them. Even Lan, and she had ordered him to stay away from
her lessons with the Sea Folk. She was not certain he believed her
story about slipping on the stairs the other day. &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t
supposed to go anywhere without an escort!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alivia shrugged, a slight movement of one shoulder. A
few days ago, she had been a bundle of simpers that made Talaan
look bold. She did not simper for anybody, now. &ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t
anyone free, so I slipped out by myself. Anyway, if you always
guard me, you&rsquo;ll never come to trust me, and I&rsquo;ll never
get to kill <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>.&rdquo; Somehow that sounded even more
chilling, delivered in such a casual tone. &ldquo;You ought to be
learning from me. Those Asha&rsquo;man say they&rsquo;re weapons, and
they aren&rsquo;t bad, I know for a fact, but I&rsquo;m better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as may be,&rdquo; Nynaeve replied sharply,
shifting her shawl. &ldquo;And maybe we know more than you think we do.&rdquo;
She would not mind demonstrating a few of the weaves she had
learned from Moghedien for this woman. Including a few they had all
agreed were too nasty to do to anyone. Except&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She was fairly
certain the other woman could overpower her easily, whatever she
did. Keeping her feet from shifting under that intense stare was
not easy. &ldquo;Until&mdash;unless!&mdash;we decide differently, you
won&rsquo;t let me see you without two or three Kinswomen again, if
you know what&rsquo;s good for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you say so,&rdquo; Alivia said, not at all abashed.
&ldquo;What message do you want me to take back to Mistress Corly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell Mistress Corly I have to decline her kind
invitation. And remember what I told you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell her,&rdquo; the Seanchan woman drawled,
completely ignoring the admonition. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think it was
exactly an invitation. An hour after first dark, she said. You
might want to remember that.&rdquo; With a slight, knowing smile, she
walked away, not hurrying at all to return where she belonged.</p>

<p>Nynaeve glared at the retreating woman&rsquo;s back,
and not because of her lack of a curtsy. Well, not only that. A
pity she had not hung on to a few of her simpers, for sisters,
anyway. With a glance at the door that hid the Atha&rsquo;an Miere,
Nynaeve considered following Alivia to make sure she did as she had
been told. Instead, she went in the opposite direction. She did not
hurry. It would be unpleasant if the Sea Folk came out and decided
she had been eavesdropping, but she definitely did not hurry. She
merely wanted to walk briskly. That was all.</p>

<p>The Atha&rsquo;an Miere were hardly the only ones in
the Palace she wanted to avoid. Not exactly an invitation, was it?
Sumeko Karistovan, Chilares Arman and Famelle Juarde had been in
the Knitting Circle with Reanne Corly. Dinner was only an excuse.
They would want to talk to her about the Windfinders. More
specifically, about the relationship between the Aes Sedai in the
Palace and the Sea Folk &ldquo;wilders.&rdquo; They would not quite upbraid her
for failing to maintain the dignity of the White Tower. They had
not gone that far; not yet, though they seemed to be coming closer.
But the whole dinner would be full of pointed questions and sharper
comments. Nothing she could simply order them to stop. She doubted
they would for less than a command. And they were quite capable of
coming to find her if she did not go to them. Trying to teach them
to show backbone had been a terrible mistake. At least she was not
the only one who had to put up with it, though she thought Elayne
had managed to avoid the worst. Oh, how she looked forward to
seeing them back in novice white or Accepted&rsquo;s dresses. How
she looked forward to seeing the last of the Atha&rsquo;an
Miere!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve!&rdquo; came a strangely muted cry behind her. In
Sea Folk accents. &ldquo;Nynaeve!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Forcing her hand away from her braid, Nynaeve spun on
her heel, ready to deliver a tongue-lashing. She was not teaching
now, they were not on a ship, and they could bloody well leave her
alone!</p>

<p>Talaan skidded to a halt in front of her, bare feet
sliding on the dark red floor tiles. Panting, the young woman
swiveled her head as if afraid someone would sneak up on her. She
flinched every time a liveried servant moved just on the edge of
her sight, and only breathed again when she saw it was just a
servant. &ldquo;Can I go to the White Tower?&rdquo; she asked breathlessly,
wringing her hands and dancing from foot to foot. &ldquo;I will never be
chosen. A sacrifice, they call it, leaving the sea forever, but I
dream of becoming a novice. I will miss my mother terribly, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Please. You must take me to the Tower. You must!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve blinked at the onslaught. Many women dreamed
of becoming Aes Sedai, but she had never before heard one say she
dreamed of becoming a novice. Besides&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The Atha&rsquo;an Miere
refused passage to Aes Sedai on any ship whose Windfinder could
channel, but to keep sisters from trying to look deeper, every so
often an apprentice was chosen to go to the White Tower. Egwene
said there were only three sisters from among the Sea Folk at
present, all weak in the Power. For three thousand years that had
been enough to convince the Tower that the ability was rare and
small with Atha&rsquo;an Miere women, not worth investigating.
Talaan was right; no one as strong as she would ever be allowed to
go to the Tower, even now that their subterfuge was coming to an
end. In fact, it was part of the bargain with them that
Atha&rsquo;an Miere sisters be allowed to give up being Aes Sedai
and return to the ships. The Hall of the Tower would not <em>
half</em> howl about that!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the training is very hard, Talaan,&rdquo; she said
gently, &ldquo;and you must be at least fifteen. Besides&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Something
else the young woman had said struck her suddenly. &ldquo;You will miss
your mother?&rdquo; she said incredulously, not caring how it
sounded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am nineteen!&rdquo; Talaan replied indignantly. Looking
at that boyish face and form, Nynaeve was not sure she believed.
&ldquo;And of course I will miss my mother. Do I look unnatural? Oh; I
see. You do not understand. We are very affectionate in private,
but she must avoid any sign of favor in public. That is a serious
crime, with us. It could have mother stripped of her rank, and <em>
both</em> of us hung upside down in the rigging to be flogged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve grimaced at the mention of upside down. &ldquo;I
certainly can see where you would want to avoid that,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Even so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everyone tries to avoid even a hint of favor, but it
is worse for me, Nynaeve!&rdquo; Really, the girl&mdash;woman&mdash;young woman&mdash;would have to learn not to step on what a sister
was saying if she did become a novice. Not that she could, of
course. Nynaeve tried to regain the initiative, but words poured
out of Talaan in a torrent. &ldquo;My grandmother is Windfinder to the
Wavemistress of Clan Rossaine, my great-grandmother is Windfinder
to Clan Dacan, and her sister to Clan Takana. My family is honored
that five of us have risen so high. And everyone watches for signs
that Gelyn abuses its influence. Rightly so, I know&mdash;favor
cannot be allowed&mdash;but my sister was kept an apprentice five
years longer than normal, and my cousin six! Just so no one can
claim they were favored. When I cast the stars and give our
position correctly, I am punished for being slow even when I have
the answer as fast as Windfinder Ehvon! When I taste the sea and
name the coast we are approaching, I am punished because the taste
I name is not quite what Windfinder Ehvon tastes! I shielded you
twice, but tonight I will hang by my ankles for not doing so
sooner! I am punished for flaws ignored in others, for flaws I
never make, because I <em>might</em>! Was your novice training any
harder than that, Nynaeve?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My novice training,&rdquo; Nynaeve said faintly. She
wished the woman would not keep bringing up being hung by the
ankles. &ldquo;Yes. Well. You really don&rsquo;t want to hear about that.&rdquo;
<em>Four</em> generations of women with the ability? Light! Even
daughter following mother was rare enough. The Tower really would
want Talaan. That was not going to happen, though. &ldquo;I suppose Caire
and Tebreille really love one another, too?&rdquo; she said, trying to
change the subject.</p>

<p>Talaan sneered. &ldquo;My aunt is sly and deceitful. She
celebrates any humiliation she can cause my mother. But my mother
will bring her low, as she deserves. One day, Tebreille will find
herself serving on a soarer, beneath a Sailmistress with an iron
hand and sore teeth!&rdquo; She gave a grim, satisfied nod at the
thought. And then jumped, wide-eyed as a fawn, when a serving man
hurried by behind her. That recalled her to her purpose. She went
back to trying to look every way at once as she spoke hastily. &ldquo;You
cannot speak out during the lessons, of course, but any other time
will do. Announce that I am to go the Tower, and they will not be
able to deny you. You are Aes Sedai!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve goggled at the girl. And they would have
forgotten all about it by the next time she gave a lesson? The fool
had <em>seen</em> what they did to her! &ldquo;I can see how much you
want to go, Talaan,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Talaan broke in, making a quick bow.
&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; And she darted back the way she had come at a dead
run.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Nynaeve shouted, taking a few steps after
her. &ldquo;Come back! I didn&rsquo;t promise anything!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Servants turned to stare at her, and continued to
shoot wondering glances in her direction even after returning to
their tasks. She would have run after the idiot except that she was
afraid she would have to follow her straight to Zaida and the
others. And the fool would probably gush out that she was going to
the Tower, that Nynaeve had promised. Light, she would probably
tell them anyway!</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look as if you just swallowed a rotten plum,&rdquo;
Lan said, appearing at her side, tall and starkly handsome in his
well-fitting green coat. She wondered how long he had been there.
It did not seem possible that a man so large, so commanding in his
presence, could stand still enough that you failed to notice him,
even without a Warder&rsquo;s cloak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A basketful of them,&rdquo; she murmured, pressing her
face against her husband&rsquo;s broad chest. It felt very good to
lean against his strength, just for a moment, while he stroked her
hair softly. Even if she did have to shift his sword hilt out of
her ribs. And anyone who wanted to stare at such a public display
of affection could go hang themselves. She could see disaster
piling up on disaster. Even if she told Zaida and the others she
had no intention of taking Talaan anywhere, they were going to <em>
skin</em> her. There would be no hiding it from Lan this time. If
she had managed to the first. Reanne and the others would learn of
it. And Alise! They would start treating her the way they did
Merilille, ignoring her orders, giving her about as much respect as
the Windfinders did Talaan. Somehow she would be saddled with
guarding Alivia, and some catastrophe would come of it, some utter
humiliation. That was all she seemed fit to do, lately; find
another way to be humiliated. And every fourth day, she would still
have to face Zaida and the Windfinders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember how you kept me in our rooms
yesterday morning?&rdquo; she murmured, looking up in time to catch a
grin replacing concern on his face. Of course he remembered. Her
face grew hot. Talking to friends was one thing, but being forward
with her own husband still seemed quite another. &ldquo;Well, I want you
to take me back there right now and keep me from putting on any
clothes for about a year!&rdquo; She had been quite furious about that,
at first. But he had ways to make her forget to be furious.</p>

<p>He threw back his head and laughed, a great booming
sound, and after a moment, she echoed him. She wanted to weep,
though. She had not really been joking.</p>

<p>Having a husband meant that she did not have to share
a bed with another woman, or two, and it gained her a sitting room.
It was not large, but it always seemed snug, with a good fireplace
and a small table with four chairs. Certainly as much as she and
Lan needed. Her hopes for privacy were dashed as soon as they
entered the sitting room, though. The First Maid was waiting in the
middle of the flowered carpet, as stately as a queen, as neatly
turned out as if she had just finished dressing, and not at all
pleased. And in one corner of the room was a roughly dressed, lumpy
fellow with a horrible wart on his nose and a scrip dangling
heavily from his shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This man claims he has something you want urgently,&rdquo;
Mistress Harfor said once she had made brief courtesies. Very
brief, if proper; she did not waste them on anyone except Elayne.
She sounded equally disapproving of Nynaeve and the fellow with the
wart. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind telling you, I do not like the looks of
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tired as Nynaeve was, embracing the Source was almost
beyond her, but she managed it in a flash, spurred by thoughts of
assassins and the Light knew what. Lan must have caught some change
in her face, because he took a step toward the warty fellow; he did
not touch his sword, but suddenly his whole stance seemed as if the
blade were already drawn. How he sometimes managed to read her mind
when another held his bond, she could not say, but she was pleased.
She had managed to match Talaan&mdash;in strength, at least!&mdash;but she was not sure she could channel enough right then to
knock over a chair. &ldquo;I never,&rdquo; she began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon, Mistress,&rdquo; the lumpy fellow muttered
hurriedly, tugging his greasy forelock. &ldquo;Mistress Thane said you
wanted to see me right away. Women&rsquo;s Circle business, she
said. Something about Cenn Buie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve gave herself a shake, and after a moment
remembered to close her mouth. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said slowly, staring at
the fellow. Seeing anything but that awful wart was difficult, but
she was certain she had never laid eyes on him before. Women&rsquo;s
Circle business. No man would be allowed a sniff of that. It was
secret. She held on to <em>saidar</em>, though. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;remember,
now. Thank you, Mistress Harfor. I&rsquo;m sure you have all sorts
of things to see to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rather than take the hint, the First Maid hesitated,
frowning at her suspiciously. That frown slid around to the lumpy
man, then settled on Lan and vanished. She nodded to herself, as if
his presence somehow made the difference! &ldquo;I will leave you, then.
I&rsquo;m sure Lord Lan can handle this fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stifling her indignation, Nynaeve barely waited for
the door to close before rounding on the lumpy fellow and his wart.
&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;How do you know those names?
You&rsquo;re no Two Riv&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;rippled. There was no other word for
it. He rippled and stretched taller, and suddenly it was Rand,
grimacing and swallowing, in rumpled woolens with those awful heads
glittering red-and-gold on the backs of his hands and a leather
scrip on his shoulder. Where had he learned that? Who had taught
him? She resisted the idea of disguising herself, just for a
moment, to show him she could do as much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you didn&rsquo;t take your own advice,&rdquo; Rand
said to Lan, just as if she were not there. &ldquo;But why do you let her
pretend to be Aes Sedai? Even if the real Aes Sedai let her, she
can get hurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because she is Aes Sedai, sheepherder,&rdquo; Lan replied
quietly. He did not look at her either! And he still seemed ready
to draw his sword in a heartbeat. &ldquo;As for the other&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Sometimes, she is stronger than you. Did you take it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand looked at her then. To frown disbelievingly.
Even when she pointedly adjusted her shawl so the yellow fringe
swayed. What he said though, shaking his head slowly, was &ldquo;No.
You&rsquo;re right. Sometimes you&rsquo;re just too weak to do what
you should.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you two blathering about?&rdquo; she said
sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just things that men talk about,&rdquo; Lan replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; Rand said.</p>

<p>She sniffed at that. Gossip and idle chatter, that
was what men&rsquo;s talk was, nine times in ten. At best. Wearily,
she let go of <em>saidar</em>. Reluctantly. She did not need to
protect herself against Rand, certainly, but she would have liked
to hold on a little longer, just to touch it, tired or not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know about Cairhien, Rand,&rdquo; she said, sinking
gratefully into a chair. Those cursed Sea Folk had worn her out!
&ldquo;Is that why you&rsquo;re here, dressed that way? If you&rsquo;re
trying to hide from whoever it was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He looked tired. Harder
than she remembered, but very tired. He remained standing, though.
Strangely, he seemed much like Lan, ready to draw a sword he was
not wearing. Maybe that attempt to kill him would be enough to make
him see sense. &ldquo;Rand, Egwene can help you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not hiding exactly,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;At least,
just until I kill some men who need killing.&rdquo; Light, he was as
matter of fact about it as Alivia! Why did he and Lan keep eyeing
one another and pretending they were not? &ldquo;Anyway, how could Egwene
help?&rdquo; he went on, setting the scrip on the table. It made a soft
but solid sound of weight inside. &ldquo;I suppose she&rsquo;s Aes Sedai,
too?&rdquo; He sounded <em>amused</em>! &ldquo;Is she here, as well? You three,
and two real Aes Sedai. Only two! No. I don&rsquo;t have time for
that. I need you to keep something until&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egwene is the Amyrlin Seat, you fool woolhead,&rdquo; she
growled. It was nice to be able to interrupt someone else for a
change. &ldquo;Elaida is a usurper. I hope you&rsquo;ve had sense enough
not to go near her! You wouldn&rsquo;t leave that meeting on your
own two legs, I can tell you! There are five <em>real</em> Aes
Sedai here, <em>including</em> me, and three hundred more with
Egwene and an army, ready to pull Elaida down. Look at yourself!
Whatever your brave talk, somebody almost killed you, and
you&rsquo;re sneaking around dressed like a stableman! What safer
place for you than with Egwene? Even those Asha&rsquo;man of yours
wouldn&rsquo;t dare go against three hundred sisters!&rdquo; Oh, yes; very
nice indeed. He tried to mask his surprise, but he made a poor job
of it, staring at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be surprised what my Asha&rsquo;man would
dare,&rdquo; he said dryly after a minute. &ldquo;I suppose Mat is with
Egwene&rsquo;s army?&rdquo; Putting a hand to his head, he staggered.</p>

<p>Only half a step, but she was out of her chair before
he could right himself. Embracing <em>saidar</em> with an effort,
she reached up to clasp his head between her hands, and laboriously
wove a Delving around him. She had tried finding a better way to
find what ailed someone, so far without success. It was enough. No
sooner had the weave settled on him than her breath caught. She had
known about the wound in his side from Falme, never healing
completely, resisting all the Healing she knew, like a pustule of
evil in his flesh. Now there was another half-healed wound atop the
old, and that pulsed with evil, too. A different sort of evil,
somehow, like a mirror of the other, yet just as virulent. And she
could not touch either with the Power. She did not really want to&mdash;just thinking of it made her skin crawl!&mdash;but she
tried. And something unseen held her away. Like a ward. A ward she
could not see. A ward of <em>saidin</em>?</p>

<p>That made her stop channeling and step back. She
clung to the Source; no matter how tired she was, she would have
had to force herself to let go. No sister could think of the male
half of the Power without at least a touch of fear. He looked down
at her calmly, and that made her shiver. He seemed another man
entirely from the Rand al&rsquo;Thor she had watched grow up. She
was very glad that Lan was there, hard as that was to admit.
Suddenly she realized that he had not relaxed by a whisker. He
might chatter with Rand like two men over pipes and ale, but he
thought Rand was dangerous. And Rand looked at Lan as if he knew
it, and accepted it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of that is important now,&rdquo; Rand said, turning
to the scrip on the table. She did not know whether he meant his
wounds or where Mat was. From the scrip he produced two statuettes
a foot high, a wise-looking, bearded man and an equally wise and
serene woman, each in flowing robes and holding aloft a clear
crystal sphere. From the way he handled them, they were heavier
than they appeared. &ldquo;I want you to keep these hidden for me until I
send for them, Nynaeve.&rdquo; One hand on the figure of the woman, he
hesitated. &ldquo;And for you. I&rsquo;ll need you when I use them. When
we use them. After I take care of those men. That has to come
first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Use them?&rdquo; she said suspiciously. Why did killing
anyone have to come first? That was hardly the important question,
though. &ldquo;For what? Are they <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He nodded. &ldquo;With this, you can touch the greatest
<em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em> ever made for a woman. It&rsquo;s buried on
Tremalking, I understand, but that doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo; His hand
moved to the figure of the man. &ldquo;With this one, I can touch its
male twin. I was told by&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;someone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;once, that a man and
woman using those <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em> could challenge the Dark
One. They might have to be used for that, one day, but in the
meantime, I hope they&rsquo;re enough to cleanse the male half of
the Source.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it could be done, wouldn&rsquo;t they have done it
in the Age of Legends?&rdquo; Lan said quietly. Quiet the way steel
sliding from a scabbard was quiet. &ldquo;You said once that I could get
her hurt.&rdquo; It seemed impossible his voice could grow any harder,
but it did. &ldquo;You could kill her, sheepherder.&rdquo; And his tone made
clear that he would not allow that.</p>

<p>Rand met Lan&rsquo;s cold blue stare with one just as
cold. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why they didn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t care
why. It has to be tried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve bit her lower lip. She supposed Rand made
this a public occasion&mdash;shifting from public to private,
deciding which was which, made her dizzy sometimes&mdash;but she
did not care that Lan had spoken out of turn. He was bad that way,
in any case, but she liked an outspoken man. She needed to think.
Not about her decision. She had made that. About how to implement
it. Rand might not like it. Lan certainly would not. Well, men
always wanted their own way. Sometimes you just had to teach them
they could not always have it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it is a wonderful idea,&rdquo; she said. That was
not exactly a lie. It <em>was</em> wonderful, compared to the
alternatives. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see why I should sit here waiting
for your summons like a serving maid. I&rsquo;ll do it, but we all
go together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had been right. They did not like it one bit.</p>
