<h4><em>Blue Carp Street</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">M</span>in
sat cross-legged on the bed, not as comfortable a
position in a riding dress as it was in breeches, and rolled one of
her knives across the backs of her fingers. It was an absolutely
useless skill, Thom had told her, but sometimes it caught
peoples&rsquo; eyes and made them pay attention without need to do
more. In the middle of their room Rand was holding his scabbarded
sword up to study the cuts he had made in the peace-bond, and paid
her no attention at all. The Dragon&rsquo;s heads on the backs of
his hands glittered, metallic red and gold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You admit this has to be a trap,&rdquo; she growled at
him. &ldquo;Lan admits it. A half-blind goat in Seleisin has more brains
than to walk into a trap! &lsquo;Only fools kiss hornets or bite
fire!&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; she quoted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A trap isn&rsquo;t really a trap if you know
it&rsquo;s there,&rdquo; he said absently, bending the end of one of the
severed wires a little to line up better with its mate. &ldquo;If you
know it&rsquo;s there, maybe you can see a way to walk in so it
isn&rsquo;t a trap at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She threw the knife as hard as she could. It flew in
front of his face to stick quivering in the door, and she gave a
little jump recalling the last time she had done that. Well, she
was not lying on top of him, now, and Cadsuane was not going to
walk in, worse luck. Burn the man, that frozen knot of emotions in
her head had not even quivered when the knife streaked by, not by
so much as a flicker of surprise! &ldquo;Even if you just see Gedwyn and
Torval, you know the others will be there, hiding. Light, they
could have fifty sell-swords waiting!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Far Madding?&rdquo; He stopped looking at the knife
sticking in the door, but only to shake his head and go back to
examining the peace-bond. &ldquo;I doubt there are two mercenaries in the
whole city, Min. Believe me, I don&rsquo;t intend to get myself
killed here. Unless I can see how to spring the trap without
getting caught, I won&rsquo;t go near it.&rdquo; There was no more fear in
him than in a stone! And about as much sense! He did not intend to
get killed, as if anyone ever intended to!</p>

<p>Scrambling off the bed, she opened the front of the
bedside table long enough to take out the strap that Mistress Keene
made sure was in every room, even if she did rent to outlanders.
The thing was as long as her arm and as wide as her hand, with a
wooden handle at one end and the other end split into three tails.
&ldquo;Maybe if I took this to you, it would clear your nose enough to
smell what&rsquo;s in front of you!&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>That was when Nynaeve and Lan and Alivia walked in.
Nynaeve and Lan were cloaked, and Lan had his sword at his hip.
Nynaeve had removed all of the jewelry except for one gemmed
bracelet and the jeweled belt, the Well. Lan closed the door
quietly. Nynaeve and Alivia stood staring at Min with the strap
raised over her head.</p>

<p>Hastily she dropped the thing to the flowered carpet
and kicked it underneath the bed with the side of her foot. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t understand why you&rsquo;re letting Lan do this,
Nynaeve,&rdquo; she said as firmly as she could. At the moment, that was
not particularly firm. Why did people <em>always</em> walk in at
the worst time?</p>

<p>&ldquo;A sister has to trust her Warder&rsquo;s judgment
sometimes,&rdquo; Nynaeve said coolly, drawing on her gloves. Her face
belonged on a porcelain doll for all the emotion it displayed. Oh,
she was being Aes Sedai to her toenails.</p>

<p><em>He isn&rsquo;t your Warder, he&rsquo;s your
husband</em>, Min wanted to say, <em>and at least you can go along
to look after him. I don&rsquo;t know if my Warder will</em> ever <em>marry
me, and he threatened to tie me up if</em> I <em>tried to go with
him!</em> Not that she had argued very hard on that point. If he
was going to be a bull-goose fool, there were better ways to save
him than trying to stick a knife in somebody.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we are going to do this, sheepherder,&rdquo; Lan said
grimly, &ldquo;best we be about it while there&rsquo;s still light to
see.&rdquo; His blue eyes seemed colder than ever, and hard as polished
stones. Nynaeve gave him a worried look that almost made Min feel
sorry for her. Almost.</p>

<p>Rand belted his sword over his coat, then settled his
cloak with the hood hanging down his back and turned toward her.
His face was as hard as Lan&rsquo;s, his blue-gray eyes almost as
cold, but in her head that frozen stone blazed with veins of fiery
gold. She wanted to tangle her hands in the black-dyed hair that
almost brushed his shoulders and kiss him no matter how many people
were watching. Instead, she folded her arms across her chest and
lifted her chin, making her disapproval clear. She did not intend
for him to die here, either, and she was not about to let him start
thinking she would give in just because he was stubborn.</p>

<p>He did not try to take her in his arms. Nodding as if
he actually understood, he picked up his gloves from the small
table by the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back as soon as I can, Min. Then
we&rsquo;ll go to Cadsuane.&rdquo; Those golden veins continued to glow
even after he left the room, followed by Lan.</p>

<p>Nynaeve paused, holding the door. &ldquo;I will look after
them both, Min. Alivia, please stay with her and see she
doesn&rsquo;t do anything foolish.&rdquo; She was all cool, dignified Aes
Sedai composure. Until she glanced into the hallway. &ldquo;Burn them!&rdquo;
she yelped. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re leaving!&rdquo; And she ran, leaving the door
standing half open.</p>

<p>Alivia closed it. &ldquo;Shall we play games to pass the
time, Min?&rdquo; Crossing the carpet, she sat down on the stool in front
of the fireplace and took a piece of string from her beltpouch.
&ldquo;Cat&rsquo;s cradle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you, Alivia,&rdquo; Min said, almost shaking her
head at the eagerness in the woman&rsquo;s voice. Rand might be
complacent about what Alivia was going to do, but Min had set
herself to get to know her, and what she had found was startling.
On the surface, the former <em>damane</em> was a mature woman who
appeared well into her middle years, stern and fierce and even
intimidating. She certainly managed to intimidate Nynaeve. Nynaeve
seldom said please to anyone except Alivia. But she had been made
<em>damane</em> at fourteen, and her love of playing
children&rsquo;s games was not the only oddity about her.</p>

<p>Min wished there was a clock in the room, though the
only inn she could imagine with a clock in every room would be an
inn for queens and kings. Pacing back and forth under Alivia&rsquo;s
watchful gaze, she counted seconds in her head, trying to judge how
long it would take Rand and the others to go beyond sight of the
inn. When she decided enough time had passed, she took her cloak
from the wardrobe.</p>

<p>Alivia darted to block the door, hands on her hips,
and there was nothing childlike in her expression. &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t
going after them,&rdquo; she drawled in a firm voice. &ldquo;It would only
cause trouble, now, and I can&rsquo;t allow that.&rdquo; With those blue
eyes and that golden hair, her coloring was all wrong, but she
reminded Min of her Aunt Rana, who always seemed to know when you
had done something wrong and always saw to it that you did not want
to do it again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember those talks we had about men,
Alivia?&rdquo; The other woman turned bright red, and Min hurriedly
added, &ldquo;I mean the one about how they don&rsquo;t always think with
their brains.&rdquo; She had often heard women sneer that some other
woman knew nothing about men, but she had never actually met one of
those until she encountered Alivia. She really did know nothing!
&ldquo;Rand will get himself in more than enough trouble without me. <em>
I</em> am going to find Cadsuane, and if you try to stop me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;
She held up a clenched fist.</p>

<p>For a long moment, Alivia frowned at her. Finally she
said, &ldquo;Let me get my cloak, and I&rsquo;ll go with you.&rdquo;</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">There were no sedan chairs or liveried servants to be
seen on Blue Carp Street, and carriages would never have fit along
the narrow, twisting passage. Slate-roofed stone shops and houses
lined the street, most of two stories, sometimes jammed one hard
against the next and sometimes with a little alleyway between. The
pavement was still slick from the rain, and the cold wind tried to
carry Rand&rsquo;s cloak away, but people were back out and bustling
about. Three Street Guards, one with a catchpole on his shoulder,
paused to glance at Rand&rsquo;s sword, then went on their way. Not
far along on the other side of the street, the building housing the
shop of the bootmaker Zeram rose a full three stories, not counting
the attic under the peaked roof.</p>

<p>A skinny man with very little chin dropped
Rand&rsquo;s coin into his purse and used a thin strip of wood to
lift a brown-crusted meat pie from the charcoal grill on his barrow.
His face was lined, his dark coat shabby, and his long graying hair
was tied with a leather cord. His eyes flickered to Rand&rsquo;s
sword, and looked away quickly. &ldquo;Why do you ask about the
bootmaker? That&rsquo;s the best mutton, there.&rdquo; A toothy grin made
his chin almost vanish, and his eyes suddenly looked very shifty.
&ldquo;First Counsel herself don&rsquo;t eat better.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>There were meat pies called pasties when I was a
boy</em>, Lews Therin murmured. <em>We would buy them in the
country and</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Juggling the pie from hand to hand, the heat soaking
through his gloves, Rand suppressed the voice. &ldquo;I like to know what
kind of man makes my boots. Is he suspicious of strangers, for
instance? A man doesn&rsquo;t do his best work if he&rsquo;s
suspicious of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mistress,&rdquo; the chinless fellow said, ducking
his head to a stout gray-haired woman with a squint. Wrapping four
meat pies in coarse paper, he handed her the package before taking
her coins. &ldquo;A pleasure, Mistress. The Light shine on you.&rdquo; She
tottered away without a word, clutching the wrapped pies under her
cloak, and he grimaced sourly at her back before returning his
attention to Rand. &ldquo;Zeram never had a suspicious bone, and if he
did, Milsa wouldn&rsquo;t let him keep it. That&rsquo;s his wife.
Since the last of the children married, Milsa&rsquo;s been renting
out the top floor. Whenever she finds somebody don&rsquo;t mind
being locked in at night, anyway,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;Milsa had stairs
put in right up to the third floor, so it&rsquo;s private, but she
wouldn&rsquo;t pay for having a new door cut as well, so the stairs
come out in the shop, and she&rsquo;s not trusting enough to leave
that unlocked at night. You going to eat that pie, or just look at
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taking a quick bite, Rand wiped hot juice from his
chin and walked over to shelter beneath the eaves of a small
cutler&rsquo;s shop. Along the street others were snatching a quick
meal from the food-peddlers, meat pies or fried fish or twisted
paper cones heaped with roasted peas. Three or four men as tall as
he, and two or three women as tall as most of the other men in the
street, might have been Aiel. Maybe the chinless fellow was not as
shifty as he seemed, or maybe it was just that Rand had eaten
nothing since breakfast, but Rand found himself wanting to gobble
the pie down and buy another. Instead, he made himself eat slowly.
Zeram seemed to be doing a good business. A steady if not constant
flow of men went into his shop, most carrying a pair of boots to be
mended. Even if he let visitors go up without sending word ahead,
he would be able to identify them later, and maybe so would two or
three others.</p>

<p>If the renegades were renting the top floor from the
bootmaker&rsquo;s wife, being locked in at night would not
inconvenience them much. To the south, an alleyway separated the
bootmaker&rsquo;s from a single-story house, a dangerous drop, but
on the other side, a two-story building with a seamstress on the
ground floor stood wall-to-wall with the bootmaker. Zeram&rsquo;s
building had no windows except at the front&mdash;in back was
another alley, for taking away rubbish; Rand had already checked&mdash;but there had to be a way onto the roof so the slates could
be repaired when necessary. From there it would be a short drop to
the seamstress&rsquo;s roof, with only three more to cross before
another low building, a candle-maker&rsquo;s shop, and an easy jump
to the street, or into the alley behind the buildings. There would
not be a great deal of risk in it at night, or even in daylight, if
you stayed back from the street and were careful about the
Guard&rsquo;s patrols when you came down. The way Blue Carp Street
bent, the nearest watchstands were out of sight.</p>

<p>Two men approaching the bootmaker&rsquo;s made him
turn away and pretend to peer through the bubbled panes of the
cutler&rsquo;s small shopwindow at a display of scissors and knives
fastened to a board. One of the men was tall, though not as tall as
the possible Aielmen. Their deep cowls hid their faces, but neither
carried a pair of boots, and although they held their cloaks with
both hands, the wind flipped the tails of them enough to show the
bottoms of scabbarded swords. A gust pulled the shorter man&rsquo;s
hood from his head, and he snatched it back again, but not before
the damage was done. Charl Gedwyn had taken to wearing his hair
caught at the nape of his neck in a silver clip set with a large
red stone, but he was still a hard-faced man with a challenging
look about him. And Gedwyn&rsquo;s presence made the other Torval.
Rand was willing to wager on it. None of the others was as
tall.</p>

<p>Waiting until the pair had gone into Zeram&rsquo;s
shop, Rand licked a few greasy crumbs from his gloves and went in
search of Nynaeve and Lan. He found them before he was far enough
along the curve of the street to lose sight of the
bootmaker&rsquo;s. The candlemaker&rsquo;s he had marked as a way
down from the rooftops stood a little behind him, with an alley at
one side. Ahead, the narrow street twisted back the other way. No
more than fifty paces farther on was a watchstand with a Street
Guard at the top, but another building of three stories, a
cabinetmaker&rsquo;s that shared the alleyway with the candlemaker,
blocked the rooftops beyond from his view.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Half a dozen people recognized Torval and Gedwyn,&rdquo;
Lan said, &ldquo;but none of the others.&rdquo; He kept his voice low, though
no one passing more than glanced at the three of them. A glimpse of
two men wearing swords beneath their cloaks was enough to make
everyone who noticed step a little faster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A butcher down the street says those two buy from
him,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, &ldquo;but never more than enough for two.&rdquo; She
looked sideways at Lan as though hers was the real proof.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw them,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re inside now.
Nynaeve, can you lift Lan and me to that rooftop from the alley
behind the building?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve frowned at Zeram&rsquo;s building, rubbing the
belt around her waist with one hand. &ldquo;One at a time, I could,&rdquo; she
said finally. &ldquo;But it would use more than half what the Well holds.
I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to lift you down again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Up is enough,&rdquo; Rand told her. &ldquo;We will leave over
the rooftops, and climb down right over beside the
candlemaker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She protested, of course, as they walked back down
the street toward the bootmaker&rsquo;s shop. Nynaeve always fought
anything she had not thought of herself. &ldquo;I am just supposed to put
you on the roof and wait?&rdquo; she muttered, scowling left and right so
hard that as many people shied away from her as from the men
flanking her, swords or no swords. She thrust her hand out from
under her cloak to show the bracelet with its pale red stones.
&ldquo;This can cover me with armor better than any steel. I&rsquo;d
hardly even feel a sword hitting me. I <em>thought</em> I would be
going inside with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do what?&rdquo; Rand asked softly. &ldquo;Hold them with the
Power for us to kill? Kill them yourself?&rdquo; She frowned at the
paving stones in front other feet.</p>

<p>Walking beyond Zeram&rsquo;s shop, Rand paused in
front of the low house and looked around as casually as he could.
There were no Street Guards in sight, but when he prodded Nynaeve
into the narrow alley, he moved quickly. He had not seen any Guards
before following Rochaid, either.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very quiet,&rdquo; Lan said, following close
behind.</p>

<p>She took three more quick steps before replying,
without slowing or looking back. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think, before,&rdquo; she
said quietly. &ldquo;I was thinking of it as an adventure, confronting
Darkfriends, renegade Asha&rsquo;man, but you are going up there to
execute them. You&rsquo;ll kill them before they know you&rsquo;re
there if you can, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand glanced over his shoulder at Lan, but the older
man only shook his head, as confused as he was. Of course they
would kill them without warning if they could. This was not a duel;
it was the execution she had named it. At least, Rand hoped very
much it would be.</p>

<p>The alley that ran behind the buildings was a little
wider than the one to the street, the rocky soil rutted with the
tracks of the rubbish barrows that were pushed along it mornings.
Blank stone walls rose around them. No one wanted a window to watch
the rubbish carts.</p>

<p>Nynaeve stood peering up at the back of Zeram&rsquo;s
building, then suddenly sighed. &ldquo;Kill them in their sleep, if you
can,&rdquo; she said, very quietly for such fierce words.</p>

<p>Something unseen wrapped snugly around Rand&rsquo;s
chest beneath his arms, and slowly he rose into the air, floating
higher until he drifted over the edge of the overhanging eave. The
invisible harness vanished, and his boots dropped to the sloping
roof, sliding a little on the damp gray slates. Crouching, he moved
back on all fours. A few moments later, Lan floated up to land on
the roof, too. The Warder crouched as well, and peered into the
alley below.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is gone,&rdquo; Lan said finally. Twisting around to
face Rand, he pointed. &ldquo;There is our way in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a trapdoor set among the slates high toward
the peak, with metal flashing to keep water out of the attic that
lifting it revealed. Rand lowered himself into a dusty space, dimly
lit by the light through the trapdoor. For a moment, he hung by his
hands, then let go, dropping the last few feet. Except for a chair
with three legs and a chest with the lid thrown open, the long room
was as empty as the chest. Apparently Zeram had stopped using the
attic for storage when his wife began taking renters.</p>

<p>Stepping lightly, the two men searched the
floorboards until they found another, larger trapdoor lying flat
against the floor. Lan felt the brass hinges and whispered that
they were dry but unrusted. Rand drew his sword and nodded, and Lan
snatched the trapdoor open.</p>

<p>Rand was not sure what he would find when he sprang
down through the opening, using a hand on the coping to control his
fall. He landed lightly on the balls of his feet, in a room that
seemed to have taken the attic&rsquo;s place from the wardrobes and
cabinets shoved against the walls, the wooden chests piled on one
another and tables with chairs standing atop them. The last thing
he expected, though, was two dead men sprawled on the floor as if
they had been dragged into the storage room and flung down. The
black swollen faces were unrecognizable, but the shorter of the
pair wore a silver hairclip set with a large red stone.</p>

<p>Dropping soundlessly from the attic, Lan looked at
the corpses and raised an eyebrow. That was all. Nothing ever
surprised him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fain is here,&rdquo; Rand whispered. As if saying the name
were a trigger, the twin wounds in his side began throbbing, the
older like a disc of ice, the newer a bar of fire across it. &ldquo;It
was him sent the letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan gestured toward the trapdoor with his sword, but
Rand shook his head. He had wanted to kill the renegades with his
own hands, yet now that Torval and Gedwyn were dead&mdash;and
almost certainly Kisman, too; there was that swollen corpse
mentioned by the merchant at The Golden Wheel&mdash;now, he
realized he did not care who killed them so long as they were dead.
If a stranger finished Dashiva, it would not matter. Fain was
another matter. Fain had harrowed the Two Rivers with Trollocs, and
given him a second wound that would not heal. If Fain was within
reach, Rand would not allow him to escape. He motioned for Lan to
do as they had in the attic, and set himself in front of the door
with his sword in both hands. When the other man pulled the door
open, he darted into a large lamplit room with a posted bed against
the far wall and a fire crackling in a small fireplace.</p>

<p>Only the speed of his movement saved him. A flicker
of movement caught the corner of his eye, something tugged at the
cloak billowing behind him, and he spun awkwardly to fend off
slashes of a curved dagger. Every movement was an effort of will.
The wounds in his side no longer throbbed; they clawed at him,
molten iron and the very soul of ice warring to rip him open. Lews
Therin howled. It was all Rand could do to think, with the
agony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you he&rsquo;s mine!&rdquo; the bony man screamed,
dancing away from Rand&rsquo;s cut. With his face contorted in fury,
his big nose and ears that stuck out made him seem something
contrived to frighten children, but his eyes held murder. Teeth
bared in a snarl, he looked like a weasel wild with killing fury. A
rabid weasel, ready to savage even a leopard. With that dagger, he
could kill any number of leopards. &ldquo;Mine!&rdquo; Padan Fain shrieked,
leaping back again as Lan rushed into the room. &ldquo;Kill the ugly
one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Only when Lan turned away from Fain did Rand realize
someone else was in the room, a tall pale man who came almost
eagerly to meet the Warder blade to blade. Toram Riatin&rsquo;s face
was haggard, but he flowed into the dance of swords with the grace
of the blademaster he was. Lan met him with an equal grace, a dance
of steel and death.</p>

<p>Startled as Rand was to see the man who had tried to
claim the throne of Cairhien in a worn coat in Far Madding, he kept
his eyes on Fain and his sword toward the one time peddler.
Darkfriend and worse, Moiraine had called him long ago. The
blinding pain in Rand&rsquo;s side made him stumble as he advanced
on Fain, ignoring the stamp of boots and the ring of steel on steel
behind him as he ignored Lews Therin&rsquo;s groans in his head.
Fain danced and darted, trying to get close enough to use the
dagger that had made the never-healing slash in Rand&rsquo;s side,
growling curses in a low voice as Rand&rsquo;s blade forced him
back. Abruptly he turned and ran, toward the back of the
building.</p>

<p>The torment tearing at Rand faded to mere throbbing
as Fain vanished from the room, but he followed cautiously even so.
At the doorway, though, he saw that Fain was not trying to hide.
The man stood waiting for him at the head of stairs leading down,
the curved dagger in one hand. The large ruby capping the hilt
glittered, catching the light of the lamps set on tables about the
windowless room. As soon as Rand stepped into the room, fire and
ice raged in his side till he could feel his heart shuddering.
Staying upright was an effort of iron will. Taking a step forward
made that effort seem pale, but he took that step, and the
next.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want him to know who is killing him,&rdquo; Fain whined
petulantly. He was glaring straight at Rand, but he seemed to
talking to himself. &ldquo;I want him to know! But if he&rsquo;s dead,
then he will stop haunting my dreams. Yes. He will stop, then.&rdquo;
With a smile, he raised his free hand.</p>

<p>Torval and Gedwyn came up the stairs with their
cloaks over their arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say we aren&rsquo;t going near him until I know
where the others are,&rdquo; Gedwyn growled. &ldquo;The M&rsquo;Hael will kill
us if&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without thought, Rand twisted his wrists in Cutting
the Wind and immediately followed with Unfolding the Fan.</p>

<p>The illusion of dead men come back to life vanished,
and Fain leaped back with a shriek, blood streaming down the side
of his face. Suddenly he tilted his head as though listening, and a
moment later, aiming a scream of wordless fury at Rand, he fled
down the stairs.</p>

<p>Wondering, Rand moved to follow the descending thumps
of Fain&rsquo;s boots, but Lan caught his arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The street out front is filling up with Guards,
sheepherder.&rdquo; A dark wetness stained the left side of Lan&rsquo;s
coat, but his sword was sheathed, proof of who had danced that
dance the better. &ldquo;Time we were on the roof, if we&rsquo;re
going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man can&rsquo;t even walk down an alley with a
sword in this city,&rdquo; Rand muttered, sheathing his own blade. Lan
did not laugh, but then, he seldom did except for Nynaeve. Shouts
and screams rose up the stairwell from below. Maybe the Street
Guards would capture Fain. Maybe he would hang for the corpses up
here. It was not enough, but it would have to do. Rand was tired of
what would have to do.</p>

<p>In the attic, Lan leapt to catch the coping of the
trapdoor in the roof and pull himself up and out. Rand was not sure
he could make that leap. The agony was gone with Fain, but his side
felt as if it had been beaten with axehandles. As he was gathering
himself to try, Lan put his head back through the trapdoor and
extended a hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They may not come up right away, sheepherder, but is
there any point in waiting to see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand caught Lan&rsquo;s hand and let himself be drawn
up to where he could catch the coping and pull himself out onto the
roof. Crouching low, they moved along the damp slates to the back
of the building, then began the short climb to the peak. There
might be Guards in the street, but there was still a chance to get
away unseen, especially if they could signal Nynaeve to make a
distraction.</p>

<p>Rand reached for the roof peak, and behind him,
Lan&rsquo;s boot slipped on the slates with a screech. Twisting
around, Rand seized the other man&rsquo;s wrist, but Lan&rsquo;s
weight pulled him down the slick gray slope. Vainly they scrabbled
with their free hands for any hold, the edge of a slate, anything.
Neither uttered a word. Lan&rsquo;s legs went over the edge, and
then the rest of him. Rand&rsquo;s gloved fingers caught on
something; he did not know what, and he did not care. His head and
one shoulder stuck over the edge of the roof, and Lan was dangling
from his grip above the ten-pace drop to the alley next to the low
house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let go,&rdquo; Lan said quietly. He looked up at Rand, his
eyes cold and hard, no expression on his face. &ldquo;Let go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the sun turns green,&rdquo; Rand told him. If he
could just pull the other man up a little, enough to catch the
eave&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whatever his fingers had caught broke with a sharp
