<h4><em>The Streets of Caemlyn</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">E</span>layne&rsquo;s
entourage attracted plenty of attention
as it rode through Caemlyn, along streets that rose and fell with
the hills of the city. The Golden Lily on the breast of her
fur-lined crimson cloak was sufficient to identify her for citizens
of the capital, but she kept her hood back, framing her face so the
single golden rose on the coronet of the Daughter-Heir was clearly
visible. Not just Elayne, High Seat of House Trakand, but Elayne
the Daughter-Heir. Let everyone see, and know.</p>

<p>The domes of the New City glinted white and gold in
the pale morning light, and icicles sparkled on the bare branches
of the trees down the center of the main streets. Even nearing its
zenith the sun lacked warmth, despite a blessedly cloudless sky.
Luckily, there was no wind today. The air was cold enough to frost
her breath, yet with the paving stones cleared of snow even on the
narrower, twisting ways, the city was alive again, the streets full
and bustling. Carters and wagon drivers, harnessed by their work as
surely as the horses between the shafts, clutched their cloaks in
resignation as they made slow passage through the throng. A huge
water wagon rumbled by, empty by the sound, on its way to be
refilled for fighting the too-frequent arsons. A few hawkers and
street peddlers braved the chill to cry their wares, but most folk
hurried about their tasks, eager to be indoors as soon as possible.
Not that hurrying meant moving very fast. The city bulged, its
population swollen beyond that of Tar Valon. In such a swarm, even
the few who were mounted moved no faster than a man could walk. In
the whole morning she had seen only two or three carriages inching
along the streets. If their passengers were not invalids or facing
miles ahead, they were fools.</p>

<p>Everyone who saw her and her party paused at the very
least, some pointing her out to others, or hoisting a child for a
better view so one day they could tell their own children they had
seen her. Whether they said they had seen the future Queen or
simply a woman who held the city for a time was the question. Most
people simply stared, but now and then a handful of voices cried
out &ldquo;Trakand! Trakand!&rdquo; or even &ldquo;Elayne and Andor!&rdquo; as she passed.
Better if there had been more cheering, yet silence was to
preferable to jeers. Andorans were outspoken folk, none more so
than Caemlyners. Rebellions had begun and queens lost their thrones
because Caemlyners voiced their displeasure in the streets.</p>

<p>An icy thought made Elayne shiver. Who holds Caemlyn
holds Andor, the ancient saying went; it was not exactly true, as
Rand had demonstrated, yet Caemlyn was Andor&rsquo;s heart. She had
laid claim to the city&mdash;the Lion Banner and Trakand&rsquo;s
Silver Keystone shared pride of place on the towers of the outer
wall&mdash;but she did not yet hold the heart of Caemlyn, and that
was far more important than holding stone and mortar.</p>

<p><em>They will all cheer me, one day</em>, she
promised herself. <em>I will earn their acclaim</em>. Today,
though, the crowded ways felt lonely between those few upraised
voices. She wished Aviendha were there, just for her company, but
Aviendha saw no reason to climb onto a horse simply to move about
the city. Anyway, Elayne could feel her. It was different from the
bond with Birgitte, yet she could feel her sister&rsquo;s presence
in the city, like sensing an unseen person in the same room, and it
was comforting.</p>

<p>Her companions drew their own share of attention.
After barely three years as Aes Sedai, Sareitha&rsquo;s dark square
face had not yet achieved agelessness, and she looked a prosperous
merchant in her fine bronze-colored woolens with a large
silver-and-sapphires brooch holding her cloak. Her Warder, Ned
Yarman, rode at her heels, and he certainly caught eyes. A tall,
broad-shouldered young man with bright blue eyes and corn-yellow
hair curling to his shoulders, he wore a shimmering Warder&rsquo;s
cloak that made him appear a disembodied head floating above a tall
gray gelding that was not entirely there either, where the cloak
draped its haunches. There was no mistaking what he was, or that
his presence announced an Aes Sedai. The others, maintaining a
circle around Elayne as they made a way through the crowd,
attracted just as many eyes, though. Eight women in the red coats
and burnished helmets and breastplates of the Queen&rsquo;s Guard
were not something seen every day. Or ever before, come to that.
She had chosen them out from the new recruits herself for that very
reason.</p>

<p>Their under-lieutenant, Caseille Raskovni, lean and
hard as any Aiel Maiden, was that rarity of rarities, a woman
merchant&rsquo;s guard, nearly twenty years in the trade, as she put
it. Silver bells in her stocky roan gelding&rsquo;s mane named her
Arafellin, though she was vague about her past. The only Andoran
among the eight was a graying, placid-faced woman with wide
shoulders, Deni Colford, who had kept order in a wagon
drivers&rsquo; tavern in Low Caemlyn, outside the walls, another
rough and singular job for a woman. Deni did not yet know how to
use the sword at her hip, but Birgitte said she had very quick
hands and quicker eyes, and she was quite adept with the pace-long
cudgel that hung opposite her sword. The remainder were Hunters for
the Horn, disparate women, tall and short, slender and wide,
dewy-eyed and gray-haired, with backgrounds as varied, though some
were as discreet as Caseille and others clearly inflated their
former station in life. Neither attitude was uncommon among
Hunters. They had leaped at the chance to be listed on the
Guards&rsquo; roll, though. More important, they had passed
Birgitte&rsquo;s close inspection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These streets are not safe for you,&rdquo; Sareitha said
suddenly, heeling her chestnut up beside Elayne&rsquo;s black
gelding. Fireheart almost managed to nip the sleek mare before
Elayne reined his head away. The street was narrow here,
compressing the crowd and forcing the Guardswomen in closer around
them. The Brown sister&rsquo;s face pictured Aes Sedai composure,
but apparent concern sharpened her tone. &ldquo;Anything might happen in
a crush like this. Remember who is staying at the Silver Swan, less
than two miles from this spot. Ten sisters at one inn are not
simply seeking their own for company. Elaida might well have sent
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She might not have, too,&rdquo; Elayne replied calmly.
More calmly than she felt. A great many sisters seemed to be
waiting on the side until the struggle between Elaida and Egwene
was over. Two had departed the Silver Swan and three more come just
since her arrival in Caemlyn. That did not sound like a party sent
on a mission. And none were Red Ajah; surely Elaida would include
Reds. Still, they were being watched as well as she could arrange,
though she did not tell Sareitha that. Elaida very much wanted her,
much more than she would want a runaway Accepted, or one connected
to Egwene and those Elaida called rebels. Why, she could not quite
understand. A queen who was Aes Sedai would be a great prize for
the White Tower, but she would not become queen if she was snatched
back to Tar Valon. For that matter, Elaida had issued the order to
bring her back by any means necessary long before there seemed any
possibility she would assume the throne for many years to come. It
was a puzzle she had fretted over more than once since Ronde Macura
slipped her that foul brew that dulled a woman&rsquo;s ability to
channel. A very worrying puzzle, especially now she was announcing
her location to the world.</p>

<p>Her eyes lingered a moment on a black-haired woman in
a blue cloak with her hood thrown back. The woman barely glanced at
her before turning into a candlemaker&rsquo;s shop. A weighted cloth
bag hung from her shoulder. Not an Aes Sedai, Elayne decided.
Merely another woman who aged well, like Zaida. &ldquo;In any case,&rdquo; she
went on firmly, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be penned up by fear of Elaida.&rdquo; What
<em>were</em> those sisters at the Silver Swan up to?</p>

<p>Sareitha snorted, and not very softly; she seemed
about to roll her eyes, then thought better of it. Occasionally
Elayne caught an odd look from one of the other sisters in the
Palace, doubtless thinking of how she had been raised, yet on the
surface, at least, they accepted her as Aes Sedai, acknowledged
that she stood higher among them than any except Nynaeve. That was
not enough to stop them speaking their minds, often more bluntly
that they would have with a sister who stood where she did and had
achieved the shawl in more usual fashion. &ldquo;Forget Elaida, then,&rdquo;
Sareitha said, &ldquo;and remember who else would like to have you in
hand. One well-aimed rock, and you are an unconscious bundle,
easily carried away in the confusion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Did Sareitha really have to tell her water was wet?
Kidnapping other claimants to the throne was almost customary,
after all. Every House that stood against her had supporters in
Caemlyn watching for an opportunity, or she would have her slippers
for her midday meal. Not that they could succeed, not so long as
she could channel, but they would make the attempt given a chance.
She had never thought that simply reaching Caemlyn provided
safety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t dare leave the Palace, Sareitha, I
will never get the people behind me,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;I must be
seen, out and about and unafraid.&rdquo; That was why she had eight
Guards instead of the fifty Birgitte had wanted. The woman refused
to grasp the realities of politics. &ldquo;Besides, they would need two
well-aimed rocks with you here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sareitha snorted again, but Elayne did her best to
ignore the other&rsquo;s obstinacy. She wished she could ignore the
woman&rsquo;s presence, but that was impossible. She had more reason
for this ride than being seen. Halwin Norry gave her facts and
figures by the ream, though the First Clerk&rsquo;s droning voice
almost put her to sleep, yet she wanted to see for herself. Norry
could make a riot sound as lifeless as a report on the state of the
city&rsquo;s cisterns or the expense of cleaning the sewers.</p>

<p>The crowds were thick with foreigners, Kandori with
forked beards and Illianers with beards that left their upper lips
bare and Arafellin with silver bells in their braids,
copper-skinned Domani, olive-skinned Altarans and dark Tairens,
Cairhienin who stood out for their short stature and pale skins.
Some were merchants, caught by the sudden onset of winter or hoping
to steal a jump on their competition, smooth-faced puffed-up folk
who knew that trade was the life&rsquo;s blood of nations, and every
one of them claiming to be a major artery even when betrayed by a
poorly dyed coat or a brooch of brass and glass. Many of the people
afoot had worn and ragged coats, breeches out at the knee, dresses
with tattered hems, and threadbare cloaks or none at all. Those
were refugees, either harried from their homes by war or sent
wandering by the belief that the Dragon Reborn had broken every
bond that held them. They hunched against the cold, faces haggard
and defeated, and let themselves be buffeted by the flow of others
around them.</p>

<p>Watching a dull-eyed woman stagger through the crowd
clutching a small child on her shoulder, Elayne fumbled a coin from
her purse and handed it to one of the Guards, an apple-cheeked
woman with cold eyes. Tzigan claimed to be from Ghealdan, the
daughter of a minor noble; well, she might be Ghealdanin, at least.
When the Guardswoman leaned down to proffer the coin, the woman
with her child staggered on by unheeding, unseeing. There were too
many in the city like that. The Palace fed thousands every day, at
kitchens set up throughout the city, but too many could not even
summon the energy to collect their bread and soup. Elayne offered a
prayer for mother and child as she dropped the coin back into her
purse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot feed everyone,&rdquo; Sareitha offered
quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Children are not allowed to starve in Andor,&rdquo; Elayne
said, as if issuing a decree. But she did not know how to stop it.
Food was still plentiful in the city, but no command could force
people to eat.</p>

<p>Some of the other foreigners had come to Caemlyn that
way, too, men and women who no longer wore rags and haunted faces.
Whatever had sent them flying from their homes, they had begun
thinking that they had traveled far enough, thinking about the
trades they had abandoned, often along with everything they
possessed. In Caemlyn, though, anyone with skill in a craft and a
little drive could always find a banker with ready coin. There were
new trades being followed in the city these days. She had seen
three clockmakers&rsquo; shops already this morning! Within her sight were
two shops selling blown glass, and nearly thirty manufactories had
been built north of the city. From now on, Caemlyn would export
glass, not import it, and crystal as well. The city had lacemakers,
now, producing as fine as Lugard ever had, and no wonder since
nearly all of them had come from there.</p>

<p>That brightened her mood a little&mdash;the taxes
those new crafts paid would help, though it would take time before
they paid much&mdash;yet it was still others in the crowds she
noticed most. Foreign or Andoran, the mercenaries were easily
picked out, hard-faced men wearing swords, swaggering even when
slowed to a crawl by the press. Merchants&rsquo; guards also went
armed, rough fellows shouldering aside most men who got in their
way, but they seemed subdued and sober compared to the sell-swords.
And on the whole, they displayed fewer scars. Mercenaries dotted
the crowd like raisins in a cake. With such a large pool to draw
on, and with winter employment for their skills always in short
supply, she did not think they would come too dear. Unless, as
Dyelin feared, they cost her Andor. Somehow, she had to find enough
men that foreigners were not a majority in the Guards. And the
money to pay them.</p>

<p>Abruptly, she became aware of Birgitte. The other
woman was angry&mdash;she often was, of late&mdash;and coming
closer. Very angry, and coming very quickly. An ominous combination
that set alarm gongs ringing in Elayne&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>Immediately she ordered a return to the Palace by the
most direct route&mdash;that would be how Birgitte was coming; the
bond would lead her straight to Elayne&mdash;and they took the
next turn south, onto Needle Street. It was actually a rather wide
street, though it meandered like a river, down one hill and up the
next, but generations ago it had been full of needlemakers. Now a
few small inns and taverns were jammed among cutlers and tailors
and every sort of shop except needlemakers.</p>

<p>Before they had even reached the Inner City, Birgitte
found them climbing Pearman&rsquo;s Lane, where a handful of
fruit-sellers still clung to shops handed down since the days of
Ishara, though there was precious little to be seen in their
windows this time of year. Despite the crowd Birgitte cantered into
sight, red cloak flaring behind, scattering people before her left
and right, and only slowed her rangy gray when she saw them
ahead.</p>

<p>As if to make up for her hurry, she took a moment to
study the Guardswomen and return Caseille&rsquo;s salute before
turning her mount to walk beside Elayne&rsquo;s. Unlike them, she
wore neither sword nor armor. The memories of her past lives were
fading&mdash;she said she could remember nothing at all clearly
before the founding of the White Tower, now, though fragments still
floated up&mdash;but one thing she claimed to recall absolutely.
Every time she had tried to use a sword, she had nearly gotten
herself killed, and had even done so more than once. Her strung bow
was in a leather saddle-case, though, with a bristling quiver of
arrows on the other side. Anger boiled in her, and she wore a frown
that only deepened as she spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A half-frozen pigeon flew into the Palace cote a
little while ago with word from Aringill. The men escorting Naean
and Elenia were ambushed and killed not five miles out of the town.
Luckily, one of their horses came back with blood on the saddle, or
we&rsquo;d have known nothing for weeks yet. I doubt our luck
extends to that pair being held for ransom by brigands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fireheart pranced a few steps, and Elayne reined him
in sharply. Someone in the crowd shouted what might have been a cry
for Trakand. Or not. Shopkeepers trying to attract custom raised
enough din to muffle the words. &ldquo;So we have a spy in the Palace,&rdquo;
she said, then compressed her lips, wishing she had held her tongue
in front of Sareitha.</p>

<p>Birgitte did not seem to care. &ldquo;Unless there&rsquo;s a
<em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> trotting around we don&rsquo;t know about,&rdquo;
she replied dryly. &ldquo;Maybe now you&rsquo;ll let me assign a
bodyguard. Just a few Guards, well chosen and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; The Palace was her home. She would not be
guarded there. Glancing at the Brown, she sighed. Sareitha was
listening very attentively. There was no point in trying to hide
things now. Not this. &ldquo;You let the First Maid know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Birgitte gave her a sidelong look that, combined with
a burst of mild outrage through their shared bond, told her to go
teach her grandmother to knit. &ldquo;She intends to question every
servant who didn&rsquo;t serve your mother at least five years.
I&rsquo;m not sure she doesn&rsquo;t mean to put them to the
question. The look on her face when I told her, I was glad to get
out of her study with a whole skin. I&rsquo;m looking at others,
myself.&rdquo; She meant the Guards, but she would not say so in hearing
of Caseille and the others. Elayne did not think it likely. All the
recruiting gave anyone a perfect opportunity to slip in
eyes-and-ears, yet without any assurance they would ever be where
they could learn anything useful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there are spies in the Palace,&rdquo; Sareitha said
quietly, &ldquo;there may be worse. Perhaps you should accept the Lady
Birgitte&rsquo;s suggestion of a bodyguard. There is precedent.&rdquo;
Birgitte showed the Brown sister her teeth; as a smile, it was a
miserable failure. However much she disliked being addressed by her
title, however, she turned hopeful eyes on Elayne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said no, and I mean no!&rdquo; Elayne snapped. A beggar,
approaching the slow-moving circle of horses with a wide,
gap-toothed grin and his cap in his hand, flinched and scurried
away into the throng before she could even think of reaching for
her purse. She was not sure how much of her anger was her own and
how much Birgitte&rsquo;s, but it was appropriate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have gone to get them myself,&rdquo; she growled
bitterly. Instead, she had woven a gateway for the messenger and
spent the rest of the day meeting with merchants and bankers. &ldquo;At
the least, I should have stripped the garrison at Aringill for
escort. Ten men dead because I blundered! Worse&mdash;the Light
help me, it <em>is</em> worse!&mdash;I&rsquo;ve lost Elenia and
Naean because of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Birgitte&rsquo;s thick golden braid, hanging outside
her cloak, swung as she shook her head emphatically. &ldquo;In the first
place, queens don&rsquo;t go running off to do everything
themselves. They&rsquo;re bloody queens!&rdquo; Her anger was dying down,
a little, but irritation flared on top of it, and her tone
reflected both. She really wanted Elayne to have a bodyguard, very
likely even in her bath. &ldquo;Your adventuring days are done. The next
thing, you&rsquo;d be sneaking out of the Palace in disguise, maybe
even wandering around after nightfall, when you might get your
skull cracked open by some tough you never even saw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne sat up straight in her saddle. Birgitte knew,
of course&mdash;she did not know any way to get around the bond,
though she was sure there must be one&mdash;but the woman had no
right to bring it up now. If Birgitte offered enough hints, she
would have other sisters trying to follow her with their Warders
and likely squads of Guardsmen as well. Everyone was so ridiculous
about keeping her safe. You would think she had never been in Ebou
Dar, much less Tanchico, or Falme. Besides, she had only done it
once. So far. And Aviendha went with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cold dark streets don&rsquo;t compare to a warm fire
and an interesting book,&rdquo; Sareitha put in idly, as if talking to
herself. Studying the shops they were passing, she seemed intent on
them. &ldquo;I very much dislike walking on icy pavement, myself,
especially in the dark, without so much as a candle. Young, pretty
women often think plain clothes and a dirty face make them
invisible.&rdquo; The shift was so sudden, with no change in tone, that
at first Elayne did not realize what she was hearing. &ldquo;Being
knocked down and dragged into an alley by drunken rowdies is a hard
way to learn differently. Of course, if you are lucky enough to
have a friend with you who also can channel, if she&rsquo;s lucky
enough that the tough fails to hit her as hard as he should&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Well, you cannot be lucky every time. Wouldn&rsquo;t you agree, Lady
Birgitte?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne closed her eyes for a moment. Aviendha had
said someone was following them, but she had been sure it was only
a footpad. Anyway, it had not been like that. Not exactly.
Birgitte&rsquo;s glare promised a talking to, later. She <em>
refused</em> to understand that a Warder just did <em>not</em>
dress down her Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the second place,&rdquo; Birgitte went on grimly, &ldquo;ten
men or nearly three hundred, the bloody outcome would have been the
bloody same. Burn me, it was a good plan. A few men could have
brought Naean and Elenia to Caemlyn unnoticed. Emptying out the
garrison would have pulled every flaming eye in the east of Andor,
and whoever took them would have brought enough armsmen to be sure.
Very likely, they&rsquo;d hold Aringill now on top of it. Small as
the garrison is, Aringill keeps anybody who wants to move against
you in the east off balance, and the more Guards who come out of
Cairhien, the better that gets, since they&rsquo;re nearly all loyal
to you.&rdquo; For someone who claimed to be a simple archer, she had a
good grasp of the situation. The only thing she had left out was
the loss of the customs duties from the river trade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who did take them, Lady Birgitte?&rdquo; Sareitha asked,
leaning to look past Elayne. &ldquo;Surely that is a very important
question.&rdquo; Birgitte sighed loudly, almost a whimper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will know soon enough, I fear,&rdquo; Elayne said. The
Brown quirked a doubting eyebrow at her, and she tried not grind
her teeth. She seemed to be doing that quite a lot since coming
home.</p>

<p>A Taraboner woman in a green silk cloak stepped out
of the way of the horses and made a deep curtsy, her thin, beaded
braids swinging out of her cowl. Her maid, a diminutive woman with
her arms full of small packages, imitated her mistress awkwardly.
The two wide men close behind, guards carrying brass-ferruled
quarterstaffs, remained upright and alert. Their long heavy leather
coats would turn all but the most determined thrust of a knife.</p>

<p>Elayne inclined her head as they rode by to
acknowledge the Taraboner&rsquo;s courtesy. She had not received as
much from any Andoran in the streets, so far. The handsome face
behind the woman&rsquo;s sheer veil showed too much age to be Aes
Sedai. Light, she had too much on her plate to be worrying about
Elaida now!</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very simple, Sareitha,&rdquo; she said in a
carefully controlled voice. &ldquo;If Jarid Sarand took them, Elenia will
give Naean a choice. Declare Arawn for Elenia, with some sweetening
of estates for Naean in return, or else have her throat slit in a
quiet cell somewhere and her corpse buried behind a barn. Naean
won&rsquo;t give in easily, but her House is arguing over who is in
charge until she returns, so they&rsquo;ll dither, Elenia will
threaten torture and maybe use it, and eventually Arawn will stand
behind Sarand for Elenia. Soon to be joined by Anshar and Baryn;
they will go where they see strength. If Naean&rsquo;s people have
them, she will offer the same choices to Elenia, but Jarid will go
on a rampage against Arawn unless Elenia tells him not to, and she
won&rsquo;t if she thinks he has any hope of rescuing her. So we
must hope to hear in the next few weeks that Arawn estates are
being burned.&rdquo; <em>If not</em>, she thought, <em>I have four houses
united to face, and I</em> still <em>don&rsquo;t know whether I
really have even two!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;That is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;very nicely reasoned out,&rdquo; Sareitha
said, sounding faintly surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you could have, too, with time,&rdquo;
Elayne said, too sweetly, and felt a stab of pleasure when the
other sister blinked. Light, her mother would have expected her to
see that much when she was ten!</p>

<p>The rest of the ride back to the Palace passed in
silence, and she barely noticed the bright mosaic towers and grand
vistas of the Inner City. Instead, she thought about Aes Sedai in
Caemlyn and spies in the Royal Palace, about who had Elenia and
Naean and how much Birgitte could step up recruiting, about whether
it was time to sell the Palace&rsquo;s plate and the rest of her
gems. A gloomy list to consider, but she kept her face smooth and
serenely acknowledged the scant cheers that followed her. A queen
could not show herself afraid, especially when she was.</p>

<p>The Royal Palace was a pure white confection of
intricately worked balconies and columned walks atop the highest
hill of the Inner City, the highest in Caemlyn. Its slender spires
and gilded domes loomed against the midday sky, visible for miles,
proclaiming the power of Andor. Grand entrances and departures were
made at the front, at the Queen&rsquo;s Plaza, where in the past
great crowds had gathered to hear the proclamations of queens and
shout their acclaim for Andor&rsquo;s rulers. Elayne entered at the
rear of the Palace, Fireheart&rsquo;s steel-shod hooves ringing on
the paving stones as she trotted into the main stableyard. It was a
broad space fronted on two sides by the rows of tall arched doors
of the stables, overlooked by a single long white stone balcony,
plain and sturdy. Several of the high, columned walks offered
partial views from above, but this was a working place. In front of
the simple colonnade that gave entry to the Palace itself a dozen
Guardsmen preparing to replace those on duty in the Plaza stood
rigidly beside their horses, being inspected by their
under-lieutenant, a grizzled fellow with a limp who had been a
bannerman under Gareth Bryne. Along the outer wall, thirty more
were mounting, ready to begin patrols of the Inner City in pairs.
In normal days, there would have been Guardsmen whose main duty was
policing the streets, but with numbers so reduced, those who
protected the Palace had to do that as well. Careane Fransi was
there, as well, a stocky woman in an elegant green-striped riding
dress and blue-green cloak, sitting her gray gelding while one of
her Warders, Venr Kosaan, climbed onto his bay. Dark, with touches
of gray in his tight-curled hair and beard, the blade-slim man wore
a plain brown cloak. Apparently they did not mean to advertise who
they were.</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s arrival bought a flash of surprise to
the stableyard. Not to Careane or Kosaan, of course. The Green
sister merely looked thoughtful in the sheltering cowl of her
cloak, and Kosaan not even that. He simply nodded to Birgitte and
Yarman, Warder to Warder. Without another glance they rode out as
soon as the last of Elayne&rsquo;s escort cleared the iron-strapped
gates. But some of those mounting along the wall paused with one
foot in a stirrup, staring, and heads whipped toward the new
arrivals among the men standing inspection. She had not been
expected back for another hour at least, and excepting a few who
never thought beyond what their hands were doing, everyone in the
Palace knew the situation was volatile. Rumors spread among
soldiers even faster than among other men, and the Light knew, that
was saying something, the way men gossiped. These had to know that
Birgitte had departed in a hurry, and now she returned with Elayne,
ahead of time. Was one of the other Houses marching on Caemlyn?
Ready to attack? Were they to be ordered to the walls that they
could not man completely, even with what Dyelin had in the city?
Moments of surprise and worry, then the leathery under-lieutenant
barked a command, and eyes snapped straight ahead, arms swept
across chests in salute. Only three besides the former bannerman
had been on the rolls a few days gone, but there were no raw
recruits here.</p>

<p>Grooms in red coats with the White Lion embroidered
on one shoulder came rushing out from the stable, though in fact
there was little for them to do. The Guardswomen quietly dismounted
at Birgitte&rsquo;s order and began leading their horses through the
tall doors. She herself leaped from her saddle and tossed her reins
to one of the grooms, and she was no quicker than Yarman, who
hurried to hold Sareitha&rsquo;s bridle while she climbed down. He
was what some sisters called &ldquo;fresh caught,&rdquo; bonded less than a
year&mdash;the term dated from a time when Warders had not always
been asked whether they wanted the bond&mdash;and he was very
assiduous in his duties. Birgitte just stood scowling, fists on her
hips, apparently watching the men who would patrol the Inner City
for the next four hours ride out in a column of twos. Elayne would
have been surprised if those men more than crossed Birgitte&rsquo;s
mind, though.</p>

<p>In any event, she had her own worries. Trying not to
be obvious about it, she studied the wiry woman who held
Fireheart&rsquo;s bridle, and the stocky fellow who put down a
leather-covered mounting stool and held her stirrup as she
dismounted. He was unsmilingly stolid and deliberate, while she was
wrapped up in stroking the gelding&rsquo;s nose and whispering to
him. Neither really looked at Elayne beyond a respectful bow of the
head; courtesies came second to making sure she was not tossed from
the saddle by a horse made skittish by bobbing people. No matter
that she had no need of their help. She was not in the country any
longer, and there were forms to be followed. Even so, she tried not
to frown. Leaving them as they led Fireheart away, she did not look
back. But she wanted to.</p>

<p>The windowless entry hall beyond the colonnade seemed
dim, though a few of the mirrored stand-lamps were lit. Plain lamps
here, the iron worked into simple scrolls. Everything was
utilitarian, the plastered cornices unadorned, the white stone
walls bare and smooth. Word of their arrival had spread, and before
they were well inside, half a dozen men and women appeared, bowing
and curtsying, to take cloaks and gloves. Their livery differed
from the stablefolk&rsquo;s in having white collars and cuffs, and
the Lion of Andor on the left breast rather than shoulder. Elayne
did not recognize anyone on duty today. Most servants in the Palace
were new, and others had come out of retirement to take the places
of those frightened off when Rand captured the city. A bald,
bluff-faced fellow did not quite meet her eyes, but he might have
feared it would be too forward. A slender young woman with a squint
put too much enthusiasm into her curtsy, and her smile, but perhaps
she simply wanted to show eagerness. Elayne walked away, followed
by Birgitte, before she began glaring at them. Suspicion had a
bitter taste.</p>

<p>Sareitha and her Warder left them after a few paces,
the Brown murmuring an excuse about books she wanted to see in the
library. The collection was not small, though nothing in comparison
to the great libraries, and she spent hours there every day,
frequently pulling up age-worn volumes she said were unknown
elsewhere. Yarman heeled her as she glided off down a crossing
hallway, a dark stocky swan drawing a strangely graceful stork in
her wake. He still carried his disturbing cloak, carefully folded
over one arm. Warders rarely let those out of their own hands for
long. Kosaan&rsquo;s likely was in his saddlebags.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you like a Warder&rsquo;s cloak, Birgitte?&rdquo;
Elayne asked, walking on. Not for the first time, she envied
Birgitte her voluminous trousers. Even divided skirts made an
effort of anything beyond a sedate pace. At least she had on riding
boots instead of slippers. The bare red-and-white floor tiles would
have been freezing in slippers. There were not enough carpets to
layer in the halls as well as in the rooms; they would have been
worn out in no time, anyway, just from the constant traffic of
servants keeping up the Palace. &ldquo;As soon as Egwene has the Tower, I
will have one made for you. You should have one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about flaming cloaks,&rdquo; Birgitte
replied grimly. A foreboding scowl set her mouth in a hard line.
&ldquo;It was over so fast, I thought you&rsquo;d just bloody stumbled and
hit your bloody head. Blood and ashes! Knocked down by street
toughs! The Light only knows what might have happened!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no need to apologize, Birgitte.&rdquo; Outrage
and indignation began flooding through the bond, but she meant to
seize the advantage. Birgitte&rsquo;s chiding was bad enough in
private; she was not about to put up with it in the halls, with
servants all around, scurrying by on errands, polishing the carved
wall panels, tending stand-lamps that were gilded here. They barely
paused to offer silent courtesies to Birgitte and her, but
doubtless every one was wondering why the Captain-General looked
like a thunderhead and had their ears wide to catch whatever they
could. &ldquo;You were not there because I didn&rsquo;t want you there.
I&rsquo;ll wager Sareitha didn&rsquo;t have Ned with her.&rdquo; It hardly
seemed possible that Birgitte&rsquo;s face could darken more.
Perhaps mentioning Sareitha was a mistake. Elayne changed the
subject. &ldquo;You really must do something about your language. You are
beginning to sound like the worst sort of layabout.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;language,&rdquo; Birgitte murmured dangerously.
Even her strides changed, to something like a pacing leopard.
&ldquo;<em>You</em> talk about <em>my</em> language? At least I always
know what the words I use mean. At least I know what fits where,
and what doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Elayne colored, and her neck stiffened. She
<em>did</em> know! Most of the time. Often enough, at least. &ldquo;As
for Yarman,&rdquo; Birgitte went on, her voice still soft, and still
dangerous, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a good man, but he isn&rsquo;t over being
goggle-eyed that he&rsquo;s a Warder yet. He probably jumps when
Sareitha snaps her fingers. I was <em>never</em> goggle-eyed, and I
don&rsquo;t jump. Is <em>that</em> why you saddled me with a title?
Did you think it would rein me in? Wouldn&rsquo;t have been the
first silly thought in that head of yours. For someone who thinks
so clearly most of the time&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Well. I have a writing desk
buried in flaming reports I have to shovel through if you&rsquo;re
going to get even half the Guards you want, but we&rsquo;ll have a
good long talk tonight. My Lady,&rdquo; she added, much too firmly. Her
bow was almost mockingly formal. She stalked away, and her long
golden braid should have been bristling like an angry cat&rsquo;s
tail.</p>

<p>Elayne stamped her foot in frustration.
Birgitte&rsquo;s title was a well-earned reward, earned ten times
over just since she bonded the woman! And ten thousand times over
before that. Well, she had <em>thought</em> of the other, but not
until afterwards. Much good it had done, anyway. Whether from liege
lady or Aes Sedai, Birgitte chose which commands she obeyed. Not
when it was important&mdash;not when <em>she</em> thought it was
important, anyway&mdash;but over anything else, especially what
she called unnecessary risks, or improper behavior. As if Birgitte
Silverbow could talk to anyone about taking risks! And as for
proper behavior, Birgitte caroused in taverns! She drank and
gambled, and ogled pretty men to boot! She enjoyed looking at the
pretty ones even if she did prefer those who looked as if they had
been beaten about the head often. Elayne did not want to change her&mdash;she admired the woman, liked her, counted her a friend&mdash;but she wished there were a little more of Warder to Aes
Sedai in their relationship. And much less of knowing older sister
to scampish younger.</p>

<p>Abruptly she realized that she was standing there
scowling at nothing. Servants hesitated as they went by, and tucked
their heads down as if afraid she might be glaring at them.
Smoothing her face, she gestured to a gangling, pimply-faced boy
coming down the hall. He bowed so awkwardly and so deeply that he
staggered and almost fell over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Find Mistress Harfor and ask her to see me
immediately in my apartments,&rdquo; she told him, then added in a not
unkindly voice, &ldquo;And you might remember, your superiors won&rsquo;t
be pleased if they find you gawking at the Palace when you should
be working.&rdquo; His mouth dropped open as though she had read his
mind. Perhaps he thought she had. His wide eyes flashed to her
Great Serpent ring, and he squeaked and made an even deeper bow
before darting away at a dead run.</p>

<p>She smiled in spite of herself. It had been a wild
stab, but he was too young to be anyone&rsquo;s spy, and too nervous
not to be up to something he should not. On the other hand&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Her smile faded. On the other hand, he was not that much younger
than she.</p>
