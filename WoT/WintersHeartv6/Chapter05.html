<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">H</span><em>e
ran across the snow-covered plain, nose into
the wind, hunting for a scent, for that one precious scent. The
falling snow no longer melted on his chilled fur, but cold could
not deter him. The pads of his paws were numb, yet his burning legs
worked furiously, carrying him on, faster and faster, till the land
blurred in his eyes. He had to find her.</em></p>

<p><em>Suddenly a great grizzled gray wolf, ragged-eared
and scarred from many fights, settled down out of the sky to race
the sun beside him. Another great gray wolf, but not so large as
himself. His teeth would tear the throats of those who had taken
her. His jaws would crush their bones!</em></p>

<p><em>Your</em> she <em>is not here, Hopper sent to
him, but you are here too strongly, and too long from your body.
You must go back, Young Bull, or you will die.</em></p>

<p><em>I must find her. Even his thoughts seemed to
pant. He did not think of himself as Perrin Aybara. He was Young
Bull. Once, he had found the falcon here, and he could again. He
had to find her. Beside that need, death was nothing.</em></p>

<p><em>In a flash of gray the other wolf lunged against
his side, and though Young Bull was the larger, he was tired, and
he fell heavily. Scrambling to his feet in the snow, he snarled and
launched himself at Hopper&rsquo;s throat.</em> Nothing <em>mattered
more than the falcon.</em></p>

<p><em>The scarred wolf flew into the air like a bird,
and Young Bull went sprawling. Hopper lighted on the snow behind
him.</em></p>

<p><em>Hear me, cub! Hopper thought at him fiercely.
Your mind is twisted with fear! She is not here, and you will die
if you remain longer. Find her in the waking world. You can only
find her there. Go back, and find her!</em></p>

<p>Perrin&rsquo;s eyes snapped open. He was bone tired
and his middle felt hollow, but hunger was a shadow beside the
hollowness in his chest. He was all hollow, and distanced even from
himself, as if he were another person watching Perrin Aybara
suffer. Above him, a blue-and-gold-striped tent roof rippled in the
wind. The interior of the tent was dim and shadowed, but sunlight
made the bright canvas glow softly. And yesterday had not been a
nightmare any more than Hopper was. Light, he had tried to kill
Hopper. In the Wolf Dream, death was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;final. The air was warm,
but he shivered. He was lying on a feather mattress, in a large bed
with heavy cornerposts thickly carved and gilded. Through the scent
of charcoal burning in the braziers he smelled musky perfume, and
the woman wearing it. No one else was present.</p>

<p>Without raising his head from the pillow, he said,
&ldquo;Have they found her yet, Berelain?&rdquo; His head felt too heavy to
lift.</p>

<p>One of her camp chairs squeaked faintly as she
shifted. He had been here before often, with Faile, to discuss
plans. The tent was big enough to house a family, and
Berelain&rsquo;s elaborate furnishings would not have looked out of
place in a palace, all intricate carving and gilt, though
everything, tables and chairs and the bed itself, was held together
with pegs. They could be disassembled for storage on a cart, but
the pegs did not make for true sturdiness.</p>

<p>Under the perfume, Berelain smelled of surprise that
he knew she was there, yet her voice was composed. &ldquo;No. Your scouts
haven&rsquo;t returned yet, and mine&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;When they didn&rsquo;t
return by nightfall, I sent a full company. They found my men dead
in an ambush, killed before they had gone more than five or six
miles. I ordered Lord Gallenne to keep a tight watch around the
camps. Arganda has a strong guard mounted, too, but he sent patrols
out. Against my advice. The man&rsquo;s a fool. He thinks no one can
find Alliandre but him. I am not sure he believes anyone else is
really trying. Certainly not the Aiel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin&rsquo;s hands tightened on the soft wool
blankets covering him. Gaul would not be caught by surprise, or
Jondyn, not even by Aiel. They were still hunting, and that meant
Faile was alive. They would have been back long since if they had
found her body. He had to believe that. He lifted one of the blue
blankets a trifle. Beneath them, he was bare. &ldquo;Is there an
explanation for this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her voice did not change, but caution shimmered in
her scent. &ldquo;You and your armsman might have frozen to death if I
hadn&rsquo;t gone looking for you when Nurelle returned with news of
my scouts. No one else had the nerve to disturb you; apparently you
snarled like a wolf at everyone who did. When I found you, you were
so numb you couldn&rsquo;t hear anyone speak to you, and the other
man was ready to fall on his face. Your woman Lini kept him&mdash;all he needed was hot soup and blankets&mdash;but I had you
carried here. You might have lost some toes at best without
Annoura. She&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She seemed afraid you might die even after she
Healed you. You slept like a man already dead. She said you almost
felt like someone who had lost his soul, cold no matter how many
blankets were piled on you. I felt it, as well, when I touched
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Too much explanation, and not enough. Anger flared, a
distant anger, but he hammered it down. Faile was always jealous
when he raised his voice to Berelain. The woman would get no shouts
from him. &ldquo;Grady or Neald could have done whatever was necessary,&rdquo;
he said in a flat voice. &ldquo;Even Seonid and Masuri were closer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My own advisor came to mind first. I never thought
of the others till I was almost back here. Anyway, does it matter
who did the Healing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>So plausible. And if he asked why the First of Mayene
herself was watching over him in a half-dark tent instead of her
serving women, or some of her soldiers, or even Annoura, she would
have another plausible answer. He did not want to hear it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are my clothes?&rdquo; he asked, propping himself up
on his elbows. His voice still had no expression.</p>

<p>A single candle on a small table beside
Berelain&rsquo;s chair gave the only real light in the tent, but it
was more than enough for his eyes, even grainy with tiredness as
they were. She was garbed demurely enough, in a dark green riding
dress with a high neck that nestled her chin in a thick ruff of
lace. Putting demure on Berelain was like putting a sheepskin on a
ridgecat. Her face was faintly shadowed, beautiful and
untrustworthy. She would do what she promised, but like an Aes
Sedai, for her own reasons, and the things she had made no promises
about could stab you in the back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the chest over there,&rdquo; she said, gesturing with a
graceful hand nearly hidden in pale lace. &ldquo;I had Rosene and Nana
clean them, but you need rest and food more than clothing. And
before we get to food, and business, I want you to know that no one
hopes Faile is alive more than I.&rdquo; Her expression was so open and
honest, he could have believed her had she been anyone else. She
even managed to smell honest!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I need my clothes now.&rdquo; He twisted around to sit up
on the side of the bed with the blankets pulled across his legs.
The clothes he had been wearing lay neatly folded on a banded
travel chest that was carved and gilded within an inch of its life.
His fur-lined cloak was draped across one end of the chest, and his
axe leaned next to his boots on the brightly flowered carpets
layered for a floor. Light, he was tired. He did not know how long
he had been in the Wolf Dream, but awake there was awake, as far as
your body was concerned. His stomach rumbled loudly. &ldquo;And
food.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Berelain made an exasperated sound in her throat and
rose, smoothing her skirts, her chin lifted high with disapproval.
&ldquo;Annoura will not be pleased with you when she comes back from
talking with the Wise Ones,&rdquo; she said firmly. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just
ignore Aes Sedai. You are not Rand al&rsquo;Thor, as they will prove
to you sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she left the tent, letting in a swirl of cold
air. In her displeasure, she did not even bother to take a cloak.
Through the momentary gap in the entry flaps, he saw that it was
still snowing. Not as hard as last night, but white flakes drizzled
down steadily. Even Jondyn would have difficulty finding sign after
last night. He tried not to think about that.</p>

<p>Four braziers warmed the air in the tent, but ice
seeped into his feet as soon as they hit the carpets, and he
hurried to his clothes. Tottered to them, really, though not
dallying about it. He was so tired he could have lain down on the
carpets and gone to sleep again. On top of that, he felt weak as a
newborn lamb. Perhaps the Wolf Dream had something to do with that,
too&mdash;going there as strongly as he had, abandoning his body&mdash;but Healing likely had exacerbated matters. With nothing to
eat since yesterday&rsquo;s breakfast and a night spent standing in
the snow, he had had no reserve to draw on. Now his hands fumbled
with the simple task of putting on his smallclothes. Jondyn would
find her. Or Gaul would. Find her alive. Nothing else in the world
mattered. He felt numb.</p>

<p>He had not expected Berelain to return herself, but a
gust of cold entered carrying her perfume while he was still
drawing on his breeches. Her gaze on his back was like stroking
fingers, but he made himself go on as if alone. She would not have
the satisfaction of seeing him hurry because she was watching. He
did not look at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rosene is bringing hot food,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There is
only mutton stew, I&rsquo;m afraid, but I told her enough for three
men.&rdquo; She hesitated, and he heard her slippers shift on the
carpets. She sighed softly. &ldquo;Perrin, I know you are hurting. There
are things you might want to say that you can&rsquo;t to another
man. I can&rsquo;t see you crying on Lini&rsquo;s shoulder, so I
offer mine. We can call a truce until Faile is found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A truce?&rdquo; he said, carefully bending to tug on a
boot. Carefully so he did not fall over. Stout wool stockings and
thick leather soles would have his feet warm soon enough. &ldquo;Why do
we need a truce?&rdquo; She was silent while he donned the other boot and
folded the turndowns below his knees, not speaking until he had
done up the laces of his shirt and was stuffing it into his
breeches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, Perrin. If that is how you want it.&rdquo;
Whatever that was supposed to mean, she sounded very determined.
Suddenly he wondered whether his nose had failed him. Her scent was
affronted, of all things! When he looked at her, though, she wore a
faint smile. On the other hand, those big eyes held a glint of
anger. &ldquo;The Prophet&rsquo;s men began arriving before daylight,&rdquo; she
said in a brisk voice, &ldquo;but as I far as I know, he hasn&rsquo;t come
himself, yet. Before you see him again&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Began</em> arriving?&rdquo; he broke in. &ldquo;Masema
agreed to bring only an honor guard, a hundred men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever he agreed, there were three or four
thousand the last I looked&mdash;an army of ruffians, every man
within miles who could carry a spear, it seemed&mdash;and more
coming from every direction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hurriedly, he shrugged into his coat and buckled his
belt over it, settling the weight of the axe at his hip. It always
felt heavier than it should. &ldquo;We will see about that! Burn me, I
won&rsquo;t be lumbered with his murderous vermin!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His <em>vermin</em> are an annoyance compared to the
man himself. The danger lies with Masema.&rdquo; Her voice was cool, but
tightly leashed fear quivered in her scent. It always did when she
spoke, of Masema. &ldquo;The sisters and the Wise Ones are right about
that. If you need more proof of it than your own eyes, he has been
meeting with the Seanchan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That hit him like a hammer, especially after
Balwer&rsquo;s news of the fighting in Altara. &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; he
demanded. &ldquo;Your thief-catchers?&rdquo; She had a pair, brought from
Mayene, and she sent them off to learn what they could at every
town or village. Between them they never discovered half of what
Balwer did. Not that she told him, anyway.</p>

<p>Berelain shook her head slightly, regretfully.
&ldquo;Faile&rsquo;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;retainers. Three of them found us just before
the Aiel attacked. They had talked with men who saw a huge flying
creature land.&rdquo; She shivered a little too ostentatiously, but by
her smell, it was a true reaction. No surprise; he had seen some of
the beasts once, and a Trolloc did not look more like Shadowspawn.
&ldquo;A creature carrying a passenger. They traced her to Abila, to
Masema. I don&rsquo;t believe it was a first meeting. It had the
sound of practice, to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly her lips curved in a smile, slightly
mocking, flirtatious. This time, her scent matched her face. &ldquo;It
was not very nice of you to make me think that dried-up little
secretary of yours was finding out more than my thief-catchers when
you have two dozen eyes-and-ears masquerading as Faile&rsquo;s
retainers. I must admit, you had me fooled. There are always new
surprises to find in you. Why do you look so startled? Did you
really think you could trust Masema after all we&rsquo;ve seen and
heard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin&rsquo;s stare had little to do with Masema.
That news could mean a great deal or nothing at all. Perhaps the
man thought he could bring the Seanchan to the Lord Dragon, too. He
was mad enough for it. But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Faile had those fools
<em>spying</em>? Sneaking into Abila? And the Light knew where
else. Of course, she always said spying was a wife&rsquo;s work, but
listening to gossip around a palace was one thing; this was
altogether different. She could have told him, at least. Or had she
kept quiet because her retainers were not the only ones poking
their noses where they should not? It would be just like her. Faile
truly did possess a falcon&rsquo;s spirit. She might think it fun to
spy herself. No, he was not going to get angry with her, certainly
not now. Light, she <em>would</em> think it was fun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad to know you can be discreet,&rdquo; Berelain
murmured. &ldquo;I would not have thought it in your nature, but
discretion can be a fine thing. Especially now. My men were not
killed by Aiel, unless Aiel have taken to using crossbows and
axes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His head jerked up, and despite his best intentions,
he glared at her. &ldquo;You just slip that in? Is there anything else
you&rsquo;ve forgotten to tell me, anything that escaped your
mind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you ask?&rdquo; she almost laughed. &ldquo;I would have
to strip myself naked to reveal more than I already have.&rdquo;
Spreading her arms wide, she twisted slightly like a snake as if to
demonstrate.</p>

<p>Perrin growled in disgust. Faile was missing, the
Light only knew whether she was alive&mdash;Light, let her be
alive!&mdash;and Berelain chose <em>now</em> to flaunt herself
worse than she ever had before? But she was who she was. He should
be grateful she had clung to decency long enough for him to
dress.</p>

<p>Eyeing him thoughtfully, she ran a fingertip along
her lower lip. &ldquo;Despite what you may have heard, you will be only
the third man to share my bed.&rdquo; Her eyes were&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;smoky&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;yet
she might have been saying he was the third man she had spoken to
that day. Her scent&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The only thing that came to mind was a
wolf eyeing a deer caught in brambles. &ldquo;The other two were
politics. You will be pleasure. In more ways than one,&rdquo; she
finished with a surprising touch of bite.</p>

<p>Just then Rosene bustled into the tent in a billow of
icy air, her blue cloak thrown back and carrying an oval silver
tray covered with a white linen cloth. Perrin snapped his mouth
shut, praying she had not overheard. Smiling, Berelain seemed not
to care. Setting the tray on the largest table, the stout serving
woman spread her blue-and-gold-striped skirts in a deep curtsy for
Berelain and another, shorter, for him. Her dark eyes lingered on
him a moment, and she smiled, as pleased as her mistress, before
gathering her cloak together and hurrying out again at a quick
gesture from Berelain. She had overheard, all right. The tray gave
off the smells of mutton stew and spiced wine that made
Perrin&rsquo;s belly rumble again, but he would not have stayed to
eat if his legs had been broken.</p>

<p>Flinging his cloak around his shoulders, he stalked
out into the soft snowfall, tugging on his gauntlets. Heavy clouds
shrouded the sun, but dawn was a few hours past, by the light.
Paths had been beaten through the snow on the ground, yet the white
drifting out of the sky was piling up on bare branches and giving
the evergreens new coats. This storm was far from finished. Light,
how could the woman talk to him that way? Why would she talk that
way, and now?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; Berelain called after him, making no
effort to mute her voice. &ldquo;Discretion.&rdquo; With a wince, he quickened
his step.</p>

<p>A dozen paces from the great striped tent he realized
he had forgotten to ask the location of Masema&rsquo;s men. All
around him the Winged Guards were warming themselves at campfires,
armored and cloaked and near to their saddled mounts on the
horselines. Their lances stood close at hand in steel-tipped cones
that trailed red streamers in the wind. Despite the trees, a
straight line could have been drawn through any row of those fires,
and they were even as near the same size as humanly possible. The
supply carts they had acquired coming south were all loaded, the
horses harnessed, and they were arrayed in rigid lines, too.</p>

<p>The trees did not hide the crest of the hill
completely. Two Rivers men still stood guard up there, but the
tents were down, and he could make out loaded packhorses. He
thought he saw a black coat, too; one of the Asha&rsquo;man, though
he could not see which. Among the Ghealdanin, knots of men stood
staring up the hill, yet all in all, they appeared as ready as the
Mayeners. The two camps were even laid out alike. But nowhere was
there any sign that thousands of men were gathering, no broad
trampled paths in the snow to follow. For that matter, there were
no footprints between the three camps at all. If Annoura was with
the Wise Ones, she had been on the hill for some time. What were
they talking about? Probably how to kill Masema without him finding
out they were responsible. He glanced at Berelain&rsquo;s tent, but
the thought of going back in there with her made his hackles
rise.</p>

<p>One other tent remained up, not far away, the smaller
striped tent belonging to Berelain&rsquo;s two serving women.
Despite the drizzling snow, Rosene and Nana sat on camp stools in
front of the smaller tent, cloaked and hooded and warming their
hands over a small fire. Alike as two peas in the pod, neither was
pretty, but they had company, likely the reason they were not
huddled around a brazier inside. Doubtless Berelain insisted on
more propriety in her serving women than she managed for herself.
Normally Berelain&rsquo;s thief-catchers seldom seemed to speak more
than three words together, at least in Perrin&rsquo;s hearing, but
they were animated and laughing with Rosene and Nana. Plainly
dressed, the pair was so nondescript you would not notice one
bumping into him on the street. Perrin was still not sure which was
Santes and which Gendar. A small kettle set off to one side of the
fire smelled of mutton stew; he tried to ignore it, but his stomach
growled anyway.</p>

<p>Talk stopped as he approached, and before he reached
the fire, Santes and Gendar glanced from him to Berelain&rsquo;s
tent, faces absolutely blank, then pulled their cloaks around them
and hurried away, avoiding his eyes. Rosene and Nana looked from
Perrin to the tent, and tittered behind cupped hands. Perrin did
not know whether to blush or howl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you by any chance know where the
Prophet&rsquo;s men are gathering?&rdquo; he asked. Keeping his voice
level was hard with all their arched eyebrows and smirks. &ldquo;Your
mistress forgot to tell me exactly.&rdquo; The pair exchanged looks
hidden by their hoods and giggled behind their hands again. He
wondered whether they were brainless, but he doubted Berelain would
tolerate fluff-brains around her for long.</p>

<p>After a great deal of tittering interspersed with
quick glances at him, at each other, at Berelain&rsquo;s tent, Nana
allowed as how she was not really sure but thought it was that way,
waving a hand vaguely toward the southwest. Rosene was certain she
had heard her mistress say it was no more than two miles. Or maybe
three. They were still giggling when he strode away. Maybe they
really were goose-brained.</p>

<p>Wearily he tramped around the hill thinking about
what he had to do. The depth of snow he had to wade through once he
left the Mayener camp made his foul mood no better. Nor did the
decisions he reached. It only got fouler after he arrived where his
own people were camped.</p>

<p>Everything was as he had ordered. Cloaked Cairhienin
sat on loaded carts with the reins looped around a wrist or tucked
under a haunch, and other short figures moved along the lead lines
of remounts, soothing the haltered horses. The Two Rivers men not
on the hilltop squatted around dozens of small fires scattered
through the trees, dressed to ride and holding their horses&rsquo;
reins. There was no order to them, not like the soldiers in the
other camps, but they had faced Trollocs, and Aiel. Every man had
his bow slung across his back and a full quiver on his hip,
sometimes balanced by a sword or short-sword as well. For a wonder,
Grady was at one of the fires. The two Asha&rsquo;man usually kept a
little apart from the other men, and the other way around as well.
No one was talking, just concentrating on staying warm. The glum
faces told Perrin that Jondyn had not returned yet, nor Gaul, nor
Elyas or anybody else. There was still a chance they would bring
her back. Or at least find where she was held. For a time, it
seemed those were the last good thoughts he would have for the day.
The Red Eagle of Manetheren and his own wolfhead banner hung limp
in the falling snow, on two staffs leaning against a cart.</p>

<p>He had planned to use those flags with Masema in the
same way he had to come south, hiding in the open. If a man was mad
enough to try reclaiming Manetheren&rsquo;s ancient glories, no one
looked further to any other reason for him marching with a small
army, and so long as he did not linger, they were far too pleased
to see the madman ride on to try stopping him. There were enough
troubles in the land without calling more down on your head. Let
someone else fight and bleed and lose men who would be needed come
spring planting. Manetheren&rsquo;s borders had run almost to where
Murandy now stood, and with luck, he could have been into Andor,
where Rand had a firm grip, before having to give up the deception.
That was changed, now, and he knew the price of changing. A very
large price. He was prepared to pay, only it would not be he who
paid. He would have nightmares about it, though.</p>
