<h4><em>A Matter of Property</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">E</span>geanin
lay on her back on the bed with her hands
raised, palms toward the ceiling and fingers spread. Her pale blue
skirts made a fan across her legs, and she tried to lie very still
so as not to wrinkle the narrow pleats too much. The way dresses
confined movement, they must be an invention of the Dark Lord.
Lying there, she studied fingernails too long for her to lay hands
on a line without breaking at least half. Not that she had
personally handled lines in quite a few years, but she had always
been ready and able to, at need.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;plain foolheadedness!&rdquo; Bayle growled, poking
at the blazing logs in the brick fireplace. &ldquo;Fortune prick me,
<em>Seahawk</em> could sail nearer the wind, and faster, than any
Seanchan ship ever made. There did be squalls ahead, too, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She listened only enough to know he had stopped grumbling about
the room and taken up the same old argument. The dark-paneled
chamber was not the best at The Wandering Woman, or even close, yet
it met his requirements excepting the view. The two windows looked
out on the stableyard. A Captain of the Green ranked with a
banner-general, but in this place, most of those she outranked were
aides or secretaries to senior officers of the Ever Victorious
Army. Among the army as at sea, being of the Blood added little
unless it was the High Blood.</p>

<p>The sea-green lacquer on the nails of her little
fingers sparkled. She had always hoped to rise, eventually perhaps
to Captain of the Gold, commanding fleets, as her mother had. As a
girl, she had even dreamed of being named the Hand of the Empress
at Sea just like her mother, to stand at the left hand of the
Crystal Throne, <em>so&rsquo;jhin</em> to the Empress herself, might
she live forever, allowed to speak directly to her. Young women had
foolish dreams. And she had to admit that once chosen for the
Forerunners, she considered the possibility of a new name. Not
hoping for it, certainly&mdash;that would have been getting above
herself&mdash;yet everyone had known the recovery of the stolen
lands would mean new additions to the Blood. Now she was Captain of
the Green, ten years before she should have had any hope of it, and
stood on the slopes of that steep mountain that rose through the
clouds to the sublime pinnacle of the Empress, might she live
forever.</p>

<p>She doubted she would be given command of one
greatship, however, much less a squadron. Suroth claimed to accept
her story, but if so, why had she been left sitting at Cantorin?
Why, when orders finally came, were they to report here and not to
a ship? Of course, there were only so many commands available, even
for a Captain of the Green. It might be that. She might have been
chosen for a position near Suroth, though her orders said only that
she was to travel to Ebou Dar by the first available means and
await further instructions. Maybe. The High Blood might speak to
the low without the intervention of a Voice, but it seemed to her
that Suroth had forgotten her as soon as she was dismissed after
receiving her rewards. Which also might mean Suroth was suspicious.
Arguments that ran in circles. In any case, she could live on
seawater if that Seeker had given over his suspicions. He had no
more, or she would already be in a dungeon shrieking, yet if he was
in the city, too, he would be watching her, waiting for one
misstep. He could not shed so much as a single drop of her blood,
now, but the Seekers were experienced at dealing with that minor
difficulty. So long as he left it to watching, though, he could
stare at her until his eyes shriveled. She had a stable deck under
her feet, now, and from here on she would take great care how she
stepped. Captain of the Gold might no longer be possible, yet
retiring as Captain of the Green was honorable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Bayle demanded. &ldquo;What about that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wide and solid and strong, just the sort of man she
had always favored, he was standing beside the bed in his
shirtsleeves, a frown on his face and his fists on his hips. Not a
pose a <em>so&rsquo;jhin</em> should take with his mistress. With a
sigh, she let her hands drop onto her stomach. Bayle just would not
learn how a <em>so&rsquo;jhin</em> was supposed to behave. He took
it all as a joke, or play, as though none of it were real.
Sometimes he even said he wanted to be her Voice, no matter how
often she explained she was not of the High Blood. Once, she had
had him beaten, and afterwards he had refused to sleep in the same
bed with her until she apologized. Apologized!</p>

<p>Hastily, she ran through what she had half-heard of
his growling. Yes; still the same arguments after all this time.
Nothing new. Swinging her legs over the side of the bed, she sat up
and ticked points off on her fingers. She had done it so often, she
could deliver them by rote. &ldquo;Had you tried to run, the
<em>damane</em> on the other ship would have snapped your masts
like twigs. It was not a chance stop, Bayle, and you know it; their
first hail was a demand to know whether you were <em>Seahawk</em>.
By bringing you into the wind and announcing we were on our way to
Cantorin with a gift for the Empress, may she live forever, I
allayed their suspicions. Anything else&mdash;anything!&mdash;and
we would all have been chained in the hold and sold as soon as we
reached Cantorin. I doubt we&rsquo;d have been lucky enough to face
the headsman instead.&rdquo; She held up her thumb. &ldquo;And last, if you had
kept calm as I told you to, you would not have gone to the block,
either. You cost me a great deal!&rdquo; Several other women in Cantorin
apparently had her same taste in men. They had pushed the bidding
up extravagantly.</p>

<p>Stubborn man that he was, he scowled and scrubbed at
his short beard irritably. &ldquo;I do still say we could have dropped it
all over the side,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;That Seeker had no proof I did
have it aboard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seekers do no need proof,&rdquo; she said, mocking his
accent. &ldquo;Seekers do find proof, and the finding do be painful.&rdquo; If
he was reduced to bringing up what even he had conceded long since,
maybe she was finally nearing the end of the whole thing. &ldquo;In any
case, Bayle, you have already admitted there is no harm in Suroth
having that collar and bracelets. They can&rsquo;t be put on him
unless someone gets close enough, and I&rsquo;ve heard nothing that
suggests anyone has or will.&rdquo; She refrained from adding that it
would not matter if someone did. Bayle was not really familiar with
even the versions of the Prophecies they had on this side of the
World Sea, but he was adamant that none mentioned the necessity of
the Dragon Reborn kneeling to the Crystal Throne. It might prove
necessary for him to be fitted with this male <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>,
but Bayle would never see it. &ldquo;What is done is done, Bayle. If the
Light shines on us, we will live long in the service of the Empire.
Now, you know this city, so you say. What is there interesting to
see or do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There always do be festivals of some sort,&rdquo; he said
slowly, grudgingly. He never liked giving up his argument, no
matter how futile. &ldquo;Some may be to your taste. Some not, I do
think. You do be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;picky.&rdquo; What did he mean by that? Suddenly
he grinned. &ldquo;We could find a Wise Woman. They do hear marriage
vows, here.&rdquo; He ran his fingers across the shaven side of his
scalp, rolling his eyes upward as though trying to see it. &ldquo;Of
course, if I do recall the lecture you did give me on the &lsquo;rights and privileges&rsquo; of my position,
<em>so&rsquo;jhin</em> can only marry other <em>so&rsquo;jhin</em>,
so you do need to free me, first. Fortune prick me, you do no have
a foot of those promised estates, yet. I can take up my old trade
and give you an estate soon enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her mouth fell open. This was not something old. This
was very, very new. She had always prided herself on being
level-headed. She had risen to command by skill and daring, a
veteran of sea battles and storms and shipwreck. And right that
moment she felt like a first-voyage fingerling looking down from
the main peak, panicked and dizzy, with the whole world spinning
around her and a seemingly inevitable fall to the sea filling her
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not so simple,&rdquo; she said, surging to her feet
so he was forced to step back. Light&rsquo;s truth, she hated
sounding breathless! &ldquo;Manumission requires me to provide for your
livelihood as a free man, to see you can support yourself.&rdquo; Light!
Words flooding out in a rush were as bad as being breathless. She
imagined herself on a deck. It helped, a little. &ldquo;In your case,
that means buying a ship, I suppose,&rdquo; she said, sounding unruffled,
at least, &ldquo;and as you reminded me, I have no estates yet. Besides,
I could not allow you to return to smuggling, and you know it.&rdquo;
That much was simple truth, and the rest not really a lie. Her
years at sea had been profitable, and if the gold she could call on
was small gleanings to one of the Blood, she could buy a ship, so
long as he did not want a greatship, but she had not actually
denied being able to afford one.</p>

<p>He spread his arms, another thing he was not supposed
to do, and after a moment she laid her cheek against his broad
shoulder and let him enfold her. &ldquo;It will be well, lass,&rdquo; he
murmured gently. &ldquo;Somehow, it will be well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not call me &lsquo;lass,&rsquo; Bayle,&rdquo; she
chided, staring beyond his shoulder toward the fireplace. It would
not seem to come into focus. Before leaving Tanchico she had
decided to marry him, one of those lightning decisions that had
made her reputation. Smuggler he might be, but she could have put a
stop to that, and he was steadfast, strong and intelligent, a
seafarer. That last had always been a necessity, to her. Only, she
had not known his customs. Some places in the Empire, men did the
asking, and were actually offended if a woman even suggested. She
knew nothing of enticing a man, either. Her few lovers had all been
men of equal rank, men she could approach openly and bid farewell
when one or the other of them was ordered to another ship or
promoted. And now he was <em>so&rsquo;jhin</em>. There was nothing
wrong with bedding your own <em>so&rsquo;jhin</em>, of course, so
long as you did not flaunt the fact. He would make up a pallet at
the foot of the bed as usual, even if he never slept on it. But
freeing a <em>so&rsquo;jhin</em>, casting him off from the rights
and privileges Bayle sneered at, was the height of cruelty. No, she
was lying by avoidance again, and worse, lying to herself. She
wanted wholeheartedly to marry the man Bayle Domon. She was
bitterly unsure she could bring herself to marry manumitted
property.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As my Lady do command, so shall it be,&rdquo; he said in a
blithe mockery of formality.</p>

<p>She punched him under the ribs. Not hard. Just enough
to make him grunt. He had to learn! She did not want to see the
sights of Ebou Dar any longer. She just wanted to stay where she
was, wrapped in Bayle&rsquo;s arms, not needing to make decisions,
stay right where they stood forever.</p>

<p>A sharp knock sounded at the door, and she pushed him
away. At least he knew enough not to protest that. While he tugged
on his coat, she shook out the pleats of her dress and attempted to
smooth away the wrinkles from lying on the bed. There seemed to be
a good many, despite how still she had been. This knock might be a
summons from Suroth or a maid seeing whether she needed anything,
but whoever it was, she was not going to let anyone see her looking
as if she had been rolling about on the deck.</p>

<p>Giving up the useless attempt, she waited until Bayle
had buttoned himself up and adopted the attitude he thought proper
for a <em>so&rsquo;jhin</em>&mdash;<em>Like a captain on his
quarterdeck ready to shout orders</em>, she thought, sighing to
herself&mdash;then barked, &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; The woman who opened the door
was the last she expected to see.</p>

<p>Bethamin eyed her hesitantly before darting in and
closing the door softly behind her. The <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> took
a deep breath, then knelt, holding herself stiffly upright. Her
dark blue dress with its lightning-worked red panels looked freshly
cleaned and ironed. The sharp contrast to her own dishevelment
irritated Egeanin. &ldquo;My Lady,&rdquo; Bethamin began uncertainly, then
swallowed. &ldquo;My Lady, I beg a word with you.&rdquo; Glancing at Bayle, she
licked her lips. &ldquo;In private, if it pleases you, my Lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The last time Egeanin had seen this woman was in a
basement in Tanchico, when she removed an <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> from
Bethamin and told her to go. That would have been enough for
blackmail if she were of the High Blood! Without doubt the charge
would be the same as for freeing a <em>damane</em>. Treason. Except
that Bethamin could not reveal it without condemning herself,
too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can hear anything you have to say, Bethamin,&rdquo; she
said calmly. She was in shoal waters, and that was no place for
anything except calm. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bethamin shifted on her knees and wasted more time
with lip licking. Then, suddenly, words came out in a rush. &ldquo;A
Seeker came to me and ordered me to resume our&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;our
acquaintance and report on you to him.&rdquo; As if to stop herself
babbling, she caught her underlip in her teeth and stared at
Egeanin. Her dark eyes were desperate and pleading, just as they
had been in that Tanchico basement.</p>

<p>Egeanin met her gaze coolly. Shoal waters, and an
unexpected gale. Her strange orders to Ebou Dar suddenly were
explained. She did not need a description to know it must be the
same man. Nor did she need to ask why Bethamin was committing
treason by betraying the Seeker. If he decided his suspicions were
strong enough to take her for questioning, eventually Egeanin would
tell him everything she knew, including about a certain basement,
and Bethamin would soon find herself once more wearing an
<em>a&rsquo;dam</em>. The woman&rsquo;s only hope was to help Egeanin
evade him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rise,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Have a seat.&rdquo; Luckily, there were
two chairs, though neither appeared comfortable. &ldquo;Bayle, I think
there is brandy in that flask on the drawered chest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bethamin was so shaky that Egeanin had to help her up
and guide her to a chair. Bayle brought worked silver cups holding
a little brandy and remembered to bow and present Egeanin&rsquo;s
first, but when he returned to the chest, she saw he had poured for
himself, as well. He stood there, cup in hand, watching them as if
it were the most natural thing in the world. Bethamin stared at him
pop-eyed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think you are poised over the impaling stake,&rdquo;
Egeanin said, and the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> flinched, her
frightened gaze jerking back to Egeanin&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;You are
wrong, Bethamin. The only real crime I have committed was freeing
you.&rdquo; Not precisely true, but in the end, after all, she had placed
the male <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> in Suroth&rsquo;s hands herself. And
talking with Aes Sedai was not a crime. The Seeker might suspect&mdash;he had tried to listen at a door in Tanchico&mdash;but she
was not a <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>, charged with catching
<em>marath&rsquo;damane</em>. At worst that meant a reprimand. &ldquo;So
long as he doesn&rsquo;t learn about that, he has no reason to
arrest me. If he wants to know what I say, or anything else about
me, tell him. Just remember that if he does decide to arrest me, I
will give him your name.&rdquo; A reminder could only guard against
Bethamin suddenly thinking she saw a safe way out, leaving her
behind. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t have to make me scream once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To her surprise, the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> began to
laugh hysterically. Until Egeanin leaned forward and slapped her,
anyway.</p>

<p>Rubbing her cheek sullenly, Bethamin said, &ldquo;He knows
near enough everything <em>except</em> the basement, my Lady.&rdquo; And
she began to describe a fantastical web of treason connecting
Egeanin and Bayle and Suroth and maybe even Tuon herself with Aes
Sedai, and <em>marath&rsquo;damane</em>, and <em>damane</em> who had
been Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>Bethamin&rsquo;s voice began to grow panicky as she
darted from one incredible charge to another, and before long,
Egeanin began sipping brandy. Just sips. She was calm. She was in
command of herself. She was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;This was beyond shoal waters. She
was riding close on a lee shore, and Soulblinder himself rode that
gale, coming to steal her eyes. After listening for a time with his
own eyes growing wider and wider, Bayle drank down a brimful cup of
the dark raw liquor in one go. She was relieved to see his shock,
and guilty at feeling relieved. She would not believe him a
murderer. Besides, he was very good using his hands but only fair
at a sword; with weapons or bare-handed, the High Lord Turak would
have gutted Bayle like a carp. Her only excuse for even considering
it was that he had been with two Aes Sedai in Tanchico. The whole
thing was nonsense. It had to be! Those two Aes Sedai had not been
part of any plot, just a chance meeting. Light&rsquo;s truth, they
had been little more than girls, and near innocents at that, too
softhearted to accept her suggestion they cut the Seeker&rsquo;s
throat when they had the chance. A pity, that. They had
<em>handed</em> her the male <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>. Ice crept down
her spine. If the Seeker ever learned she had intended disposing of
the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> the way those Aes Sedai suggested, if
anyone learned, she would be judged as guilty of treason as if she
had succeeded in dropping it into the ocean&rsquo;s depths. <em>Are
you not?</em> she demanded of herself. The Dark One was coming to
steal her eyes.</p>

<p>Tears streaming down her face, Bethamin clutched her
cup to her breasts as though hugging herself. If she was trying to
keep from shaking, she failed miserably. Trembling, she stared at
Egeanin, or perhaps at something beyond her. Something horrifying.
The fire had not warmed the room very far yet, but sweat was beaded
on Bethamin&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and if he learns about Renna and
Seta,&rdquo; she babbled, &ldquo;he will know for sure! He&rsquo;ll come after
me, and the other <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>! You have to stop him! If
he takes me, I&rsquo;ll give him your name! I will!&rdquo; Abruptly she
tilted lifted the cup to her mouth unsteadily and gulped the
contents, choking and coughing, then thrust it out toward Bayle for
more. He did not move. He looked poleaxed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are Renna and Seta?&rdquo; Egeanin asked. She was as
frightened as the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>, but as always, she kept
her fear hard-reefed. &ldquo;What can the Seeker learn about them?&rdquo;
Bethamin&rsquo;s eyes slid away, refusing to meet hers, and abruptly
she knew. &ldquo;They are <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>, aren&rsquo;t they,
Bethamin? And they were collared, too, just like you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are in Suroth&rsquo;s service,&rdquo; the woman
whimpered. &ldquo;They are never allowed to be complete, though. Suroth
knows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egeanin rubbed at her eyes wearily. Perhaps there was
a conspiracy, after all. Or Suroth might be hiding what the pair
were to protect the Empire. The Empire depended on
<em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>; its strength was built on them. The news
that <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> were women who could learn to channel
might shatter the Empire to its core. It had surely shaken her.
Maybe shattered her. She herself had not freed Bethamin out of
duty. So many things had changed in Tanchico. She no longer
believed that any woman who could channel deserved to be collared.
Criminals, certainly, and maybe those who refused oaths to the
Crystal Throne, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She did not know. Once, her life had been
made up of rock-solid certainties, like guiding stars that never
failed. She wanted her old life back. She wanted a few
certainties.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; Bethamin began. She would have no lips
left if she did not stop licking them. &ldquo;My Lady, if the Seeker&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;suffers an accident&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;perhaps the danger would pass with
him.&rdquo; Light, the woman <em>believed</em> in this intrigue against
the Crystal Throne, and she was ready to let it pass to save her
own skin!</p>

<p>Egeanin rose, and the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> had no
choice but to follow. &ldquo;I will think on it, Bethamin. You will come
to see me every day you are free. The Seeker will expect it. Until
I make my decision, you will do nothing. Do you understand me?
Nothing except your duties and what I tell you.&rdquo; Bethamin
understood. She was so relieved that someone else was dealing with
the danger that she knelt again and kissed Egeanin&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>All but bundling the woman out of the room, Egeanin
closed the door, then hurled her cup at the fireplace. It hit the
bricks and bounced off, rolling across the small rug on the floor.
It was dented. Her father had given her that set of cups when she
gained her first command. All the strength seemed to have leached
out other. The Seeker had knitted moonbeams and happenstance into a
strangling cord for her neck. If she was not named property
instead. She shuddered at the possibility. Whatever she did, the
Seeker had her trapped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can kill him.&rdquo; Bayle flexed his hands, broad like
the rest of him. &ldquo;He be a skinny man, as I recall. Used to everyone
obeying his word. He will no be expecting anyone to snap his
neck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never find him to kill, Bayle. He
won&rsquo;t meet her in the same place twice, and even if you
followed her day and night, he might well be in disguise. You
cannot kill every man she speaks to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stiffening her spine, she marched to the table where
her writing desk sat and flipped open the lid. The wave-carved
writing desk, with its silver-mounted glass inkpot and silver sand
jar, had been her mother&rsquo;s gift at that first command. The
neatly stacked sheets of fine paper bore her newly granted sigil, a
sword and a fouled anchor. &ldquo;I will write out your manumission,&rdquo; she
said, dipping the silver pen, &ldquo;and give you enough coin to buy
passage.&rdquo; The pen glided across the page. She had always had a good
hand. Log entries had to be legible. &ldquo;Not enough to buy a ship, I
fear, but it must do. You will depart on the first available ship.
Shave the rest of your head, and you should have no trouble.
It&rsquo;s still a shock, seeing bald men not wearing wigs, but so
far no one seems to&mdash;&rdquo; She gasped as Bayle slid the page
right out from under her pen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you do free me, you can no give me orders,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Besides, you must ensure I can support myself if you do free
me.&rdquo; He stuck the page into the fire and watched while it blackened
and curled. &ldquo;A ship, you did say, and I will hold you to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen well and hear,&rdquo; she said in her best
quarterdeck voice, but it made no impression on him. It had to be
the cursed dress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do need a crew,&rdquo; he said right over her, &ldquo;and I
can find you one, even here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What good will a crew do me? I don&rsquo;t have a
ship. If I did, where could I sail that the Seeker couldn&rsquo;t
find me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bayle shrugged as though that was not important. &ldquo;A
crew, first. I did recognize that young fellow in the kitchens, the
one with the lass on his knee. Stop grimacing. There be no harm to
a little kissing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She drew herself up, prepared to set him firmly to
rights. She was frowning, not grimacing, that pair had been groping
at one another in public like animals, and he was her property! He
could not speak to her this way!</p>

<p>&ldquo;His name be Mat Cauthon,&rdquo; Bayle went on even as she
opened her mouth. &ldquo;By his clothes, he has come up in the world, and
far. The first time I did see him, he did be in a farmer&rsquo;s
coat, escaping Trollocs in a place even Trollocs be afraid of. The
last time, half the town of Whitebridge did be burning, close
enough to, and a Myrddraal did be trying to kill him and his
friends. I did no see for myself, but anything else be more than I
can believe. Any man who can survive Trollocs and Myrddraal do be
useful, I think. Especially now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Someday,&rdquo; she growled, &ldquo;I am going to have to see
some of these Trollocs and Myrddraal you go on about.&rdquo; The things
could not be half as fearsome as he described.</p>

<p>He grinned and shook his head. He knew what she
thought about these so-called Shadowspawn. &ldquo;Better still, young
Master Cauthon did have companions on my ship. Good men for this
situation, too. One, you do know. Thom Merrilin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egeanin&rsquo;s breath caught. Merrilin was a clever
old man. A dangerous old man. And he had been with those two Aes
Sedai when she met Bayle. &ldquo;Bayle, is there a conspiracy? Tell me.
Please?&rdquo; No one said please to property, not even to
<em>so&rsquo;jhin</em>. Not unless they wanted something badly,
anyway.</p>

<p>Shaking his head again, he leaned a hand on the stone
mantel piece and frowned into the flames. &ldquo;Aes Sedai do plot the
way fish swim. They could scheme with Suroth, but the question do
be, could she scheme with them? I did see her look at
<em>damane</em>, like they did be mangy dogs with fleas and
catching diseases. Could she even talk to an Aes Sedai?&rdquo; He looked
up, and his eyes were clear and open, hiding nothing. &ldquo;I do tell
this for true. On my grandmother&rsquo;s grave, I do know of no
plot. But did I know of ten, I still will no let that Seeker or
anyone else harm you, whatever it do take.&rdquo; It was the sort of
thing any loyal <em>so&rsquo;jhin</em> might say. Well, no
<em>so&rsquo;jhin</em> she had ever heard of would have been so
straightforward, but the sentiments were the same. Only, she knew
he did not mean it that way, could never mean it that way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Bayle.&rdquo; A steady voice was a necessity
for command, but she was proud that hers was steady now. &ldquo;Find this
Master Cauthon, and Thom Merrilin, if you can. Perhaps something
can be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He failed to bow before leaving her presence, but she
did not even consider upbraiding him. She did not intend to let the
Seeker take her, either. Whatever it took to stop him. That was a
decision she had reached before she freed Bethamin. She filled the
dented cup to the brim with brandy, meaning to get so drunk she
could not think, but instead she sat peering into the dark liquid
without touching a drop. Whatever it took. Light, she was no better
than Bethamin! But knowing it changed nothing. Whatever it
took.</p>
