<h4><em>Cold, Fat Raindrops</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
day dawned cold, with gray clouds that obscured
the rising sun and winds off the Sea of Storms that rattled loose
panes of glass in the window casements. In stories, not the sort of
day for grand rescues and escapes. It was a day for murders. Not a
pleasant thought when you were hoping to live past another dawn.
But the plan <em>was</em> simple. Now that he had a Seanchan Blood
to use, nothing could possibly go wrong. Mat tried very hard to
convince himself of that.</p>

<p>Lopin brought him breakfast, bread and ham and some
hard yellow cheese, while he dressed. Nerim was folding a few last
pieces of clothing that were to go to the inn, including some of
the shirts Tylin had had made. They were good shirts, after all,
and Nerim claimed he could do something about the lace, though as
usual he made it sound as if he was offering to sew a shroud. The
lugubrious, gray-haired little fellow was handy with a needle, as
Mat knew well. He had sewn up enough of Mat&rsquo;s wounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nerim and I will take Olver out by the refuse gate
at the rear of the Palace,&rdquo; Lopin recited with exaggerated
patience, his hands clasped at his waist. Servants in a palace
seldom missed meals, and his dark Tairen coat fit more tightly than
ever over his round belly. For that matter, the bottom of the coat
did not appear to flare as much as it once had. &ldquo;There is never
anyone there except the guards until the refuse cart leaves in the
afternoon, and they are accustomed to us taking my Lord&rsquo;s
things out that way, so they won&rsquo;t remark us. At The Wandering
Woman, we will secure my Lord&rsquo;s gold and the rest of my
Lord&rsquo;s garments, and Metwyn, Fergin and Gorderan will meet us
with the horses. We and the Redarms will then take young Olver
through the Dal Eira Gate at mid-afternoon. I have the lottery
tokens for the horses, including both pack animals, in my pocket,
my Lord. There is an abandoned stable on the Great North Road,
about a mile north of the Circuit of Heaven, where we will wait
until we see my Lord. I trust I have my Lord&rsquo;s instructions
correctly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat swallowed the last of the cheese and dusted his
hands. &ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m making you go over it too often?&rdquo; he
said, shrugging into his coat. A plain dark green coat. A man
wanted to be plain while about business like today&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I want
to make sure you have it by heart. Remember, if you don&rsquo;t see
me before sunrise tomorrow, you keep moving until you find Talmanes
and the Band.&rdquo; The alarm would go up with the morning inspection of
the kennels, and if he was not out of the city before that, he
expected to learn whether his luck ran to stopping a
headsman&rsquo;s axe. He had been told that he was fated to die and
live again&mdash;a prophecy, or near enough one&mdash;but he was
pretty sure that had already happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, my Lord,&rdquo; Lopin said blandly. &ldquo;It will be
as my Lord commands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, my Lord,&rdquo; Nerim murmured, funereal as
ever. &ldquo;My Lord commands, and we obey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat suspected they were lying, but two or three days
waiting would not hurt them, and by that time, they would have to
see he was not coming. Metwyn and the other two soldiers would
convince them, if need be. Those three might follow Mat Cauthon,
but they were not fool enough to stretch their necks on the
chopping block if his head had already fallen. For some reason, he
was not as sure of Lopin and Nerim.</p>

<p>Olver was not as upset over leaving Riselle as Mat
had feared he would be. He brought the subject up while he was
helping the boy bundle his belongings to be carried over to the
inn. All of Olver&rsquo;s things were laid out neatly on the narrow
bed in what had been the sulking room, a small sitting room, when
the apartments had been Mat&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is getting married, Mat,&rdquo; Olver said patiently,
as though explaining to someone who didn&rsquo;t see the obvious.
Popping open a narrow little carved box Riselle had given him, just
long enough to make sure his redhawk&rsquo;s feather was safe, he
snapped it shut and tucked it into the leather scrip he would be
carrying on his shoulder. He was as careful of the feather as he
had been of the purse holding twenty gold crowns and a fistful of
silver. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think her husband would like her to keep
teaching me to read. I would not, if I were her husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Mat said. Riselle had worked quickly once she
made her mind up. Her marriage to Banner-General Yamada had been
announced publicly yesterday and was to take place tomorrow, though
by custom there was usually a wait of months between. Yamada might
be a good general&mdash;Mat did not know&mdash;but he had never
stood a chance against Riselle and that marvelous bosom. Today they
were looking at a vineyard in the Rhiannon Hills that the groom was
buying for her wedding gift. &ldquo;I just thought you might want to&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;take her with us, or
something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a child, Mat,&rdquo; Olver said dryly.
Folding the linen cloth back around his striped turtle shell, he
added that to the scrip. &ldquo;You <em>will</em> play Snakes and Foxes
with me, won&rsquo;t you? Riselle enjoys playing, and you never have
time any more.&rdquo; Despite the clothes Mat was bundling up in a cloak
that would go into a pack hamper, the boy had a spare pair of
breeches and some clean shirts and stockings in the scrip, too. And
the game of Snakes and Foxes his dead father had made for him. You
were less likely to lose what you kept on your person, and Olver
had already lost more in his ten years than most people did in a
lifetime. But he still believed you could win at Snakes and Foxes
without breaking the rules, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; Mat promised. He would if he managed to
make it out of the city. He was certainly breaking enough rules to
deserve to win. &ldquo;You just take care of Wind till I get there.&rdquo;
Olver ginned widely, and for him, that was very wide indeed. The
boy loved that leggy gray gelding almost as much as he did Snakes
and Foxes.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Beslan was another who seemed to think
you could win at Snakes and Foxes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tonight,&rdquo; he growled, stalking up and down in front
of the fireplace in Tylin&rsquo;s sitting room. The slender
man&rsquo;s eyes were cold enough to take away the warmth of the
blaze, and his hands were clasped behind his back as if to keep
them from the hilt of his narrow-bladed sword. The jeweled
cylinder-clock on the wave-carved marble mantel chimed four times
for the second hour of the morning. &ldquo;With a few days&rsquo; warning,
I could have laid on something magnificent!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want anything magnificent,&rdquo; Mat told
him. He did not want anything from the man, but by chance Beslan
had seen Thom slipping into the stableyard of The Wandering Woman a
little earlier. Thom had gone to keep Joline amused until Egeanin
brought her <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> that evening, to settle her
nerves and jolly her along with courtly manners, but there could
have been any number of reasons for him to visit the inn. Well,
maybe not that many, with it full of Seanchan, but several, surely.
Only, Beslan had leaped to the reason like a duck leaping on a
beetle, and he refused to be left out. &ldquo;It will be enough if a few
of your friends fire some of the stores the Seanchan have
stockpiled on the Bay Road. After midnight, mind, as near as they
can reckon it; better an hour later than any time before.&rdquo; With any
luck, he would be out of the city before midnight. &ldquo;That will draw
their attention away south, and you know losing stores will hurt
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said I would do it,&rdquo; Beslan said sourly, &ldquo;but you
can&rsquo;t say setting fires is exactly a grand gesture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sitting back, Mat rested his hands on the
bamboo-carved arms of the chair and frowned. He wanted to rest his
hands, anyway, but his signet ring made a metallic clicking on the
gilded wood as he tapped his fingers. &ldquo;Beslan, you will be seen at
an inn when those fires are set, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; The other man
grimaced. &ldquo;Beslan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beslan flung up his hands. &ldquo;I know; I know. I
mustn&rsquo;t endanger Mother. I&rsquo;ll be seen. By midnight, I
will be as drunk as an innkeeper&rsquo;s husband! You can wager
I&rsquo;ll be seen! It just isn&rsquo;t very heroic, Mat. I&rsquo;m at
war with the Seanchan whether or not Mother is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat tried not to sigh. He almost succeeded.</p>

<p>There was no way to hide the three Redarms moving
horses out of the stables, of course. Twice that morning he noticed
serving women handing coins to others, and both times the woman
doing the handing over glared when she saw him. Even with Vanin and
Harnan apparently still solidly ensconced in the long barracks room
near the stables, the Palace knew that Mat Cauthon was leaving
soon, and wagers were being paid already. He just had to make sure
no one found out how soon before it was too late.</p>

<p>The wind picked up strength as the morning wore on,
but he had Pips saddled and rode his endless circles in the Palace
stableyard, huddling a little in his saddle and clutching his
cloak close. He rode more slowly than usual, so Pips&rsquo; steel
shoes made a lazy, plodding sound on the paving stones. Now and
then he grimaced at the darkening clouds in the sky and shook his
head. No, Mat Cauthon did not like being out in this weather. Mat
Cauthon would be staying somewhere warm and dry until the skies
cleared, yes, he would.</p>

<p>The <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> walking <em>damane</em> in
their own circle in the stableyard knew he was leaving soon, too.
Maybe the serving women did not talk directly to the Seanchan
women, but what one woman knew was always known to every woman
inside a mile soon enough. Wildfire did not run through dry woods
as fast as gossip ran through women. A tall yellow-haired <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em> glanced in his direction and shook her head. A
short stout <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> laughed out loud, splitting a
face as dark as any of the Sea Folk. He was just Tylin&rsquo;s
Toy.</p>

<p>The <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> did not concern him, but
Teslyn did. For several days, until this morning, he had not seen
her among the <em>damane</em> being exercised. Today the <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em> let their cloaks fly with the wind, but the <em>
damane</em> all held theirs tightly around them, except
Teslyn&rsquo;s gray cloak flapped this way and that, forgotten, and
she stumbled a little where the pavement was uneven. Her eyes were
wide and worried in that Aes Sedai face. Occasionally she darted a
glance at the buxom black-haired <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> wearing the
other end of her silver leash, and when she did, she licked her
lips uncertainly.</p>

<p>A tightness settled in Mat&rsquo;s belly. Where had
the determination gone? If she was ready to knuckle under&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything all right?&rdquo; Vanin said when Mat
dismounted and gave him Pips&rsquo; reins. Rain had begun to fall,
cold fat drops, and the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> were hurrying their
charges inside, laughing and running to avoid getting wet. Some of
the <em>damane</em> were laughing, too, a sound to chill Mat&rsquo;s
blood. Vanin took no chances anyone might wonder why they were
standing in the rain to talk. The fat man bent to lift Pips&rsquo;
left foreleg and study the hoof. &ldquo;You look a mite more peaked than
usual.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything is just fine,&rdquo; Mat told him. The ache in
his leg and hip gnawed like a tooth, but he was barely aware of it
or of the quickening rain. Light, if Teslyn was cracking now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;Just remember. If you hear shouting inside the Palace tonight, or
anything that sounds like trouble, you and Harnan don&rsquo;t wait.
You ride out right then and go find Olver. He&rsquo;ll be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know where the little tyke&rsquo;ll be.&rdquo; Letting go
of Pips&rsquo; leg and straightening, Vanin spat through one of the
gaps in his teeth. Raindrops ran down his face. &ldquo;Harnan ain&rsquo;t
too stupid to put his boots on alone, and I know what to do. You
just take care of your piece of it and make sure your luck is
working. Come on there, boy,&rdquo; he added much more warmly to Pips. &ldquo;I
got some good oats for you. And a fine hot fish stew for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat knew he should eat, too, but he felt as though he
had swallowed a stone, and it did not leave room for food. Hobbling
back up to Tylin&rsquo;s apartments, he threw his damp cloak over a
chair, and for a time stood staring at the corner where his
black-hafted spear stood propped next to his unstrung bow. He
planned to come back for the <em>ashandarei</em> at the last
moment. The Blood should all be abed by the time he moved, and the
servants, as well, with only the guards outside remaining awake,
but he would not risk being seen with it before he had to. Even the
Seanchan who called him Toy would take notice of him carrying a
weapon through the halls in the middle of the night. He had meant
to carry the bow, too. Good black yew was almost impossible to find
outside the Two Rivers, and they cut it too short besides.
Unstrung, a bow should be two hands taller than the man who would
draw it. Maybe he should abandon it after all, though. He would
need both hands to use the <em>ashandarei</em>, if it came to that,
and the moment needed to drop the bow might be the moment that
killed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything will go according to plan,&rdquo; he said
aloud. Blood and ashes, he sounded as woolheaded as Beslan! &ldquo;I am
not going to have to fight my way out of the bloody Palace!&rdquo; And
almost as fool-witted. Luck was a very fine thing with the dice.
Depending on luck other places could get a man dead.</p>

<p>Lying down on the bed, he propped one booted foot
atop the other and lay studying the bow and the spear. With the
door to the sitting room open, he could hear the cylinder-clock
softly chime each hour away. Light, he needed his luck tonight.</p>

<p>The window light faded so slowly he almost got up to
see whether the sun had stopped, but eventually gray light faded to
purple twilight, then to full dark. The clock chimed twice, and
then the only sounds were the drumming of the rain and the rush of
the wind. Workmen who had been braving the weather would be downing
tools to trudge home. No one came to light the lamps or tend the
fires. No one expected him to be there, since he had slept in the
bed the night before. The flames in the bedroom fireplace dwindled
and died. Everything was in motion, now. Olver was snug in that old
stable; it still had most of its roof. The clock sounded the first
full hour of the night, and after no more than a week, four chimes
for the second.</p>

<p>Rising from the bed, he felt his way into the
pitch-dark sitting room and pulled open the hinged casement of one
of the tall windows. The strong wind drove raindrops through the
intricate white wrought-iron screen, quickly soaking his coat. The
moon was hidden behind clouds, and the city was a mass of
rain-shrouded darkness without even lightning to break it. All the
street-lamps had apparently been extinguished by the rain and wind;
the night would hide them when they left the Palace. And any patrol
that saw them out in this weather would look twice. Shivering as
the wind cut through his damp coat, he shut the casement.</p>

<p>Taking a seat on the edge of one of the bamboo-carved
chairs, he propped his elbows on his knees and watched the clock
above the dead fireplace. He could not see it in the darkness, but
here, he could hear the steady tick. He remained motionless, though
the single chime of another hour made him twitch. There was nothing
now but to wait. In a little while, Egeanin would be introducing
Joline to her <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>. If she really had been able to
find three who would do as she claimed. If Joline did not panic
when they first put the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> on her. Thom, Joline
and the others from the inn would meet him just before he reached
the Dal Eira. And if he did not reach it, Thom had gone ahead with
carving his turnip; he was sure he could get them past the gates
with his forged order. At least they had a chance, if it all fell
apart. If. Too many ifs to think about, now. It was too late for
that.</p>

<p><em>Ding</em>, from the clock, like a piece of
crystal tapped with a spoon. <em>Ding</em>. About now, Juilin would
be making his way to his precious Thera, and with any luck Beslan
was starting to drink hard at an inn somewhere. Drawing a deep
breath, he stood in the blackness and checked his knives by feel,
up his sleeves, beneath his coat, tucked into the turned-down tops
of his boots, one hanging down inside the back of his collar. That
done, he left the apartments. Too late for anything but
beginning.</p>

<p>The empty hallways he walked along were only dimly
lit. One stand lamp in three or four carried flames in front of the
mirrors, little pools of light with pale shadows between that never
quite reached darkness. His boots were loud on the floor tiles.
They rang on the marble stairs. It was unlikely anyone at all would
be awake this late, but if someone did see him, he must not look as
if he were skulking. Tucking his thumbs behind his belt, he made
himself saunter. It was no worse than stealing a pie from a kitchen
window sill. Though, come to think of it, the spotty memories that
remained of his boyhood seemed to contain getting half-skinned for
that a time or two.</p>

<p>Stepping onto the columned walk that bordered the
stable-yard, he turned up his collar against the wind-driven rain
flying between the fluted white columns. Bloody rain! A man could
drown in it, even when he had not really been outside yet. The
wall-mounted lamps had blown out, except for the pair flanking the
open gates, the only glowing spots in the pouring rain. He could
not make out the guards outside the gates. The Seanchan squad would
be as motionless as if it were a pleasant afternoon. Very likely
the Ebou Dari, too; they did not like being shown up in any way.
After a moment he retreated to the anteroom door, to avoid getting
completely drenched. Nothing moved in the stableyard. Where were
they? Blood and bloody ashes, where&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?</p>

<p>Riders appeared in the gates, led by two men afoot
carrying pole-lanterns. He could not count them in the rain, but
they were too many. Would Seanchan messengers have lantern-bearers?
Maybe, in this weather. Grimacing, he took another step back, into
the anteroom. The thin light of a single stand-lamp behind him was
enough to turn the night outside to a blanket of black, but he
peered into it. In a few minutes, four heavily cloaked figures
appeared, hurrying toward the door. If they were messengers, they
would pass him by without a second glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your man Vanin is rude,&rdquo; Egeanin announced, throwing
back her hood as soon she was beyond the fluted columns. In the
darkness, her face was just a shadow, but the coldness of her voice
was sufficient to tell him what he would see before she stepped
into the anteroom, forcing him to move back. Her brows were drawn
down sharply, and her blue eyes were icy augers. A grim-faced Domon
followed her, shaking rain from his cloak, and then a pair of <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em>, one pale and yellow-haired, the other with long
brown hair. He could not see much more since they stood with their
heads down, studying the floor tiles in front of their feet. &ldquo;You
didn&rsquo;t tell me she had two men with her,&rdquo; Egeanin went on,
peeling her gloves off. Odd, how she could make that drawl sound
brisk. She did not give a man room to squeeze in a word. &ldquo;Or that
Mistress Anan was coming. Luckily, I know how to adapt. Plans
always need adapting, once the anchor is dry. Speaking of dry, have
you been running around outside already? I trust you haven&rsquo;t
gotten yourself noticed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, you adapted the plan?&rdquo; Mat
demanded, raking his hands through his hair. Light, it <em>was</em>
wet! &ldquo;I had everything laid out!&rdquo; Why were those two <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em> standing so still? If he had ever seen statues of
reluctance, it was that pair. &ldquo;Who are those others out there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The people from the inn,&rdquo; Egeanin said impatiently.
&ldquo;For one thing, I need a proper entourage to look right for any
street patrols. Those two&mdash;Warders?&mdash;are muscular
fellows; they make excellent lantern-bearers. For another, I
didn&rsquo;t want to risk missing them in this blow. Better that we
are all together from the start.&rdquo; Her head turned, following his
glances at the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>. &ldquo;These are Seta Zarbey and
Renna Emain. I suspect they hope you&rsquo;ll forget those names
after tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pale woman flinched at the name Seta, which made
the other Renna. Neither raised her head. What hold did Egeanin
have on them, anyway? Not that it mattered. All that mattered was
that they were here and ready to do what was necessary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No point standing here,&rdquo; Mat said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get
on with it.&rdquo; He let her changes in the plan go without further
comment. After all, lying on that bed in Tylin&rsquo;s apartments,
he had decided to risk a change or two himself.</p>
