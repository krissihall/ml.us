<h4><em>The Hummingbird&rsquo;s Secret</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>rying
not to be too obvious about watching the alley
beside the candlemaker&rsquo;s, Nynaeve set the folded length of
flat green braid back on the hawker&rsquo;s tray and slipped her
hand inside her cloak to help hold it shut against the wind. It was
a finer cloak than any on the people walking by, but plain enough
that no one more than glanced at her in passing. They would if they
saw her belt, though. Women who wore jewels did not frequent Blue
Carp Street, or buy from street peddlers. After standing there for
her to finger every last bit of braid on the tray, the lean woman
grimaced, but Nynaeve had already bought three pieces of braid, two
lengths of ribbon and a packet of pins from hawkers, just for a
reason to loiter. Pins were always useful, but she did not know
what she was going to do with the rest.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard a commotion down the street, in
the direction of the watchstand, the racket of Street Guards&rsquo;
rattles loud and growing louder. The Guardsman scrambled down from
his perch. Passersby near the watchstand stared down the crossing
street and further up Blue Carp Street, then hurriedly pressed
themselves against the sides of the street as running Guardsmen
appeared, swinging their wooden rattles overhead. Not a patrol of
two or three, but a flood of armored men pounding down Blue Carp
Street, and more joining the tide from the other street. People
slow to get out of their way were shoved aside, and one man went
down under their boots. They did not slow a step as they trampled
him.</p>

<p>The braid-seller spilled half her tray scrambling to
the side of the street, and Nynaeve was just as quick to squeeze
herself against the stone housefront alongside the gaping woman.
Filling the street, catchpoles and quarterstaffs jutting up like
pikes, the mass of Guardsmen bumped her with shoulders, scraping
her along the wall. The braid-seller yelled as her tray was ripped
away and vanished, but the Guards were all staring ahead.</p>

<p>When the last man ran past, Nynaeve was a good ten
paces farther down the street than she had been. The braid-seller
shouted angrily and shook her fists at the men&rsquo;s backs.
Indignantly pulling her twisted cloak into some proper order,
Nynaeve was of a mind to do more than shout. She was half of a mind
to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Abruptly her breath froze in her throat. The Street
Guards had stopped in a mass, perhaps a hundred men shouting to one
another as if they suddenly were uncertain what to do next. They
were stopped in front of the bootmaker&rsquo;s shop. Oh, Light, Lan.
And Rand, too, always Rand, but first and foremost always the heart
of her heart, Lan.</p>

<p>She made herself breathe. A hundred men. She touched
the jeweled belt, the Well, around her waist. Less than half the
<em>saidar</em> she had stored in it remained, but it might be
enough. It would have to be enough, though she did not know for
what exactly, yet. Tugging the cowl of her cloak up, she started
toward the men in front of the bootmaker&rsquo;s. None was looking
her way. She could&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hands seized her, dragging her backward and spinning
her around to face the other direction.</p>

<p>Cadsuane had one of her arms, she realized, and
Alivia the other, the pair of them hurrying her along the street.
Away from the bootmaker&rsquo;s. Walking beside Alivia, Min kept
casting worried looks over her shoulder. Abruptly she flinched. &ldquo;He&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I think he fell,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s
unconscious, but he&rsquo;s hurt, I don&rsquo;t know how badly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will do him no good here, or ourselves,&rdquo; Cadsuane
said calmly. The golden ornaments dangling from the front of her
bun swung inside the hood of her cloak as she swivelled her head,
her eyes searching through the people ahead of them. She held the
deep cowl against the wind with her free hand, letting her cloak
flap behind her. &ldquo;I want to be away from here before one of those
boys thinks of asking women to show their faces. Any Aes Sedai
found near Blue Carp Street this afternoon will have questions to
answer because of this child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; Nynaeve snapped, pulling against them.
Lan. If Rand had been knocked unconscious, what of Lan? &ldquo;I have to
go back and help them!&rdquo; The two women dragged her along with hands
like iron. Everyone they passed was peering toward the
bootmaker&rsquo;s shop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have done quite enough already, you fool girl.&rdquo;
Cadsuane&rsquo;s voice was cold iron. &ldquo;I <em>told</em> you about Far
Madding&rsquo;s watchdogs. Phaw! You&rsquo;ve put a panic in the
Counsels with your channeling where <em>no</em> one can channel. If
the Guards have them, it is because of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought <em>saidar</em> wouldn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo;
Nynaeve said weakly. &ldquo;It was only a little, and not for long. I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I thought maybe they wouldn&rsquo;t even notice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cadsuane gave her a disgusted glance. &ldquo;This way,
Alivia,&rdquo; she said, pulling Nynaeve around the corner by the
abandoned watchstand. Small knots of excited people dotted the
street, jabbering. A man gestured vigorously as if wielding a
catchpole. A woman pointed to the empty watchstand, shaking her
head in wonder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say something, Min,&rdquo; Nynaeve pleaded. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t
just leave them.&rdquo; She did not even think of addressing Alivia, who
wore a face to make Cadsuane appear soft.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t expect sympathy from me.&rdquo; Min&rsquo;s low
voice was almost as chill as Cadsuane&rsquo;s. When she looked at
Nynaeve, it was a sidelong glare before snapping her eyes back to
the street ahead. &ldquo;I begged you to help me stop them, but you had
to be as woolheaded as they were. Now we have to depend on
Cadsuane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve sniffed. &ldquo;What can she do? Do I need to
remind you that Lan and Rand are behind us, and getting farther
behind by the minute?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boy isn&rsquo;t the only one who needs lessons in
manners,&rdquo; Cadsuane muttered. &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t apologized to me, yet,
but he told Verin he would, and I suppose I can accept that for the
moment. Phaw! That boy puts me to more trouble than any ten I ever
met before. I will do what I can, girl, which is a sight more than
you could do trying to batter your way through the Street Guards.
From here on, you will exactly as I say, or I will have Alivia sit
on you!&rdquo; Alivia nodded. So did Min!</p>

<p>Nynaeve grimaced. The woman was <em>supposed</em> to
defer to her! Still, a guest of the First Counsel <em>could</em> do
more than plain Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara, even if she donned her Great
Serpent ring. For Lan, she could put up with Cadsuane.</p>

<p>But when she asked what Cadsuane planned to do to
free the men, the only answer the woman would give was &ldquo;Much more
than I want to, girl, if I can do anything at all. But I made the
boy promises, and I keep my promises. I hope he remembers that.&rdquo;
Delivered in a voice like ice, it was not a reply to inspire
confidence.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Rand woke in darkness and pain, lying on his back.
His gloves were gone, and he could feel a rough pallet beneath him.
They had taken his boots, too. His gloves were gone. They knew who
he was. Carefully, he sat up. His face felt bruised and every
muscle in his body hurt as if he had been beaten, but nothing
seemed to be broken.</p>

<p>Standing slowly, he felt his way along the stone wall
beside the pallet, reaching a corner almost immediately, and then a
door covered with rough iron straps. In the darkness his fingers
traced a small flap, but he could not push it open. No hint of
light seeped in around its edges. Inside his head, Lews Therin
began to pant. Rand moved on, feeling his way, the floorstones cold
beneath his bare feet. The next corner came almost immediately, and
then a third, where his toes struck something that rattled on the
stone floor. Keeping one hand on the wall, he bent and found a
wooden bucket. He left it there and made himself complete the
circuit, all the way back to the iron door. All the way. He was
inside a black box three paces long and just over two paces wide.
Raising one hand, he found the stone ceiling less than a foot above
his head.</p>

<p><em>Closed in</em>, Lews Therin panted hoarsely. <em>
It&rsquo;s the box again. When those women put us in the box. We
have to get out!</em> he howled. <em>We have to get out!</em></p>

<p>Ignoring the screaming voice in his head, Rand backed
away from the door until he thought he was in the center of the
cell, then lowered himself to sit cross-legged on the floor. He was
as far from the walls as he could put himself, and in the dark he
tried to imagine them farther away, but it seemed that if he
reached out, he would not have to straighten his arm fully to touch
stone. He could feel himself trembling, as if it were someone
else&rsquo;s body shaking uncontrollably. The walls seemed just
beside him, the ceiling right over his head. He had to fight this,
or he would be as mad as Lews Therin by the time anyone came to let
him out. They would have to let him out eventually, if only to hand
him over to whoever Elaida sent. How many months for a message to
reach Tar Valon and Elaida&rsquo;s emissaries to return? If there
were sisters loyal to Elaida closer than Tar Valon, it might happen
sooner. Horror added to his shudders as he realized that he was
hoping those sisters were closer, were in the city already, so they
could take him out of this box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not surrender!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;I will be as
hard as I need to be!&rdquo; In that confined space, his voice boomed
like thunder.</p>

<p>Moiraine had died because he was not hard enough to
do what had to be done. Her name always headed the list engraved on
his brain, the women who had died because of him. Moiraine
Damodred. Every name on that list brought anguish that made him
forget the pains of his body, forget the stone walls just beyond
his fingertips. Colavaere Saighan, who died because he had stripped
her of everything she valued. Liah, Maiden of the Spear, of the
Cosaida Chareen, who died at his own hands because she followed him
to Shadar Logoth. Jendhilin, a Maiden of the Cold Peak Miagoma who
died because she wanted the honor of guarding his door. He had to
be hard! One by one he summoned up the names on that long list,
patiently forging his soul in the fires of pain.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Preparation took longer than Cadsuane had hoped,
largely because she had to impress on various people that a grand
rescue in the best traditions of gleemen&rsquo;s tales was out of
the question, so it was night before she found herself walking
along the lamplit corridors of the Hall of the Counsels. Walking
sedately, not hurrying. Hurry, and people assumed that you were
anxious, that they had the upper hand. If ever in her life she had
needed to keep the upper hand from the start, it was tonight.</p>

<p>The corridors should have been empty at this hour,
but to day&rsquo;s events had changed the normal course of things.
Blue-coated clerks were scurrying everywhere, sometimes pausing to
gape at her companions. Quite possibly, they had never seen four
Aes Sedai at once&mdash;she was not willing to allow Nynaeve that
title until she took the Three Oaths&mdash;and today&rsquo;s
commotion would have added to their confusion at the sight. The
three men bringing up the rear earned almost as many stares,
though. The clerks might not know the meaning of their black coats
or the pins on their high collars, but it was very unlikely any of
those clerks had ever seen three men wearing swords in these
hallways. In any case, with a little luck, no one would go running
to inform Aleis who was coming to break in on the Counsels sitting
in closed session. It was a pity she could not have brought the men
by themselves, but even Daigian had displayed backbone at the
suggestion. A great pity that all of her companions were not
displaying the composure showed by Merise and the other two
sisters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This will never work,&rdquo; Nynaeve grumbled, for perhaps
the tenth time since leaving the Heights. &ldquo;We should strike hard
from the start!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We should have moved faster,&rdquo; Min muttered darkly.
&ldquo;I can feel him changing. If he was a stone before, he&rsquo;s iron,
now! Light, what are they doing to him?&rdquo; Along only because she was
a link to the boy, she had been unceasing with her reports, each
bleaker than the last. Cadsuane had not told her what the cells
were like, not when the girl had broken down just telling her what
the sisters who kidnapped the boy had done to him.</p>

<p>Cadsuane sighed. A ragtag army she had assembled, but
even a makeshift army needed discipline. Especially with the battle
just ahead. It would have been worse had she not forced the Sea
Folk women to remain behind. &ldquo;I can do this without either of you,
if need be,&rdquo; she said firmly. &ldquo;No; don&rsquo;t say anything,
Nynaeve. Merise or Corele can wear that belt as well as you. So if
you children do not stop whining, I will have Alivia take you back
to the Heights and give you something to whine about.&rdquo; That was the
only reason she had brought the strange wilder. Alivia had a
tendency to become very mild-mannered around those she could not
stare down, but she stared very fiercely at those two chattering
magpies.</p>

<p>Their heads swiveled toward the golden-haired woman
as one, and the magpies fell blessedly silent. Silent, yet hardly
accepting. Min could grind her teeth all she wanted, but
Nynaeve&rsquo;s sullen glower irritated Cadsuane. The girl had good
material in her, but her training had been cut far too short. Her
ability with Healing was little short of miraculous, her ability
with almost anything else dismal. And she had not been put through
the lessons that what must be endured, could be endured. In truth,
Cadsuane sympathized with her. Somewhat. It was a lesson not
everyone could learn in the Tower. She herself, full of pride in
her new shawl and her own strength, had been taught by a near
toothless wilder at a farm in the heart of the Black Hills. Oh, it
was a very ragtag little army she had gathered to try standing Far
Madding on its head.</p>

<p>Clerks and messengers half-filled the columned
anteroom to the Counsels&rsquo; Chamber, but they were, after all,
only clerks and messengers. The clerks hesitated in officious
puzzlement, each waiting for another to speak first, but the
red-coated messengers, who knew it was not their place to say
anything, backed across the blue floortiles to the sides of the
room, and the clerks parted in front of her, none quite daring to
be the first to open his mouth. Even so, she heard a collective
gasp when she opened one of the tall doors carved with the Hand and
Sword.</p>

<p>The Counsels&rsquo; Chamber was not large. Four
mirrored stand-lamps sufficed to light it, and a large Tairen
carpet in red and blue and gold almost covered the floor tiles. A
wide marble fireplace on one side of the room made a fair job of
warming the air, though the glassed doors leading to the colonnade
outside rattled in the night wind, loud enough to drown the ticking
of the tall, gilded Illianer clock on the mantel. Thirteen carved
and gilded chairs, very nearly thrones, made an arc facing the
door, all occupied by worried-looking women.</p>

<p>Aleis, at the head of the arc, frowned when she saw
Cadsuane lead her little parade into the chamber. &ldquo;This session is
closed, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; she said, at once formal and cold. &ldquo;We may ask
you to speak to us later, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know who you have in the cells,&rdquo; Cadsuane cut
in.</p>

<p>It was not a question, but Aleis tried to bluff her
way past. &ldquo;A number of men, I believe. Public drunkards, various
foreigners arrested for fighting or stealing, a man from the
Borderlands taken just today who may have murdered three men. I do
not keep a personal record of arrests, Cadsuane Sedai.&rdquo; Nynaeve
drew a deep breath at mention of a man taken for murder, and her
eyes glittered dangerously, but at the least the child had sense
enough to keep her mouth shut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you will try to conceal that you hold the Dragon
Reborn,&rdquo; Cadsuane said quietly. She had hoped&mdash;hoped
fervently!&mdash;that Verin&rsquo;s spadework would make them back
away from this. Perhaps it could still be done simply, though. &ldquo;I
can take him off your hands. I have faced more than twenty men who
could channel, over the years. He holds no fears for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do thank you for the offer,&rdquo; Aleis replied
smoothly, &ldquo;but we prefer to communicate with Tar Valon, first.&rdquo; To
negotiate his price, she meant. Well, what had to be, had to be.
&ldquo;Do you mind telling us how you learned&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cadsuane broke in again. &ldquo;Perhaps I should have
mentioned earlier, these men behind me are Asha&rsquo;man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three stepped forward then, as they had been
instructed, and she had to admit they gave a dangerous appearance.
Grizzled Damer looked a graying bear with sore teeth, pretty Jahar
seemed a dark, sleek leopard, and Eben&rsquo;s unblinking gaze was
particularly ominous coming from that youthful face. They certainly
had their effect on the Counsels. Some simply shifted in their
chairs as if to draw back, but Cyprien let her mouth fall open,
unfortunate with her protruding teeth. Sybaine, her hair as gray as
Cadsuane&rsquo;s, sagged back in her chair and began fanning herself
with a slender hand, while Cumere&rsquo;s mouth twisted as if she
might vomit.</p>

<p>Aleis was made of sterner stuff, though she pressed
both hands tight against her midriff. &ldquo;I told you once that
Asha&rsquo;man were free to visit so long as they obeyed the law. We
have no fear of Asha&rsquo;man, Cadsuane, though I must say I am
surprised to see you in their company. Particularly in view of the
offer you have just made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, she was plain Cadsuane now, was she? Still, she
regretted the necessity to break Aleis. She led Far Madding well,
but she might never recover from tonight. &ldquo;Are you forgetting what
else happened today, Aleis? Someone channeled inside the city.&rdquo;
Again Counsels shifted, and worried frowns creased more than one
forehead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An aberration.&rdquo; The coolness was gone from
Aleis&rsquo; voice, replaced by anger, and maybe a touch of fear.
Her eyes shone darkly. &ldquo;Perhaps the guardians were in error. No one
who was questioned saw anything to suggest&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even what we think is perfect can have flaws,
Aleis.&rdquo; Cadsuane drew on her own Well, taking in <em>saidar</em> in
a measured amount. She had practice; the little golden hummingbird
could not hold near so much as Nynaeve&rsquo;s belt. &ldquo;Flaws can pass
unnoticed for centuries before they are found.&rdquo; The flow of Air she
wove was just enough to lift the gem-encrusted coronet from
Aleis&rsquo; head and set it on the carpet in front of the
woman&rsquo;s feet. &ldquo;Once they are found, however, it seems that
anyone who looks can find them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thirteen sets of shocked eyes stared at the coronet.
One and all, the Counsels seemed frozen, barely breathing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so much a flaw as a barn door, seems to me,&rdquo;
Damer announced. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s prettier on your head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The glow of the Power suddenly shone around Nynaeve,
and the coronet flew toward Aleis, slowing at the last instant so
that it settled above her bloodless face rather than cracking her
head. The light of <em>saidar</em> did not vanish from the girl,
though. Well, let her drain her Well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; Aleis swallowed, but when she went on,
her voice still cracked. &ldquo;Will it be sufficient if we release him
to you?&rdquo; Whether she meant Cadsuane or the Asha&rsquo;man was
unclear, perhaps even to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that it will,&rdquo; Cadsuane said calmly, and
Aleis sagged like a stringless puppet. Shocked as they were by the
display of channeling, questioning looks passed between the other
Counsels. Eyes darted toward Aleis, faces firmed, nods were
exchanged. Cadsuane drew a deep breath. She had promised the boy
that whatever she did would be for his good, not the good of the
Tower or anyone else&rsquo;s, and now she had broken a good woman
for his good. &ldquo;I am very sorry, Aleis,&rdquo; she said. <em>You are
building up a large account already, boy</em>, she thought.</p>
