<h4><em>An Unexpected Encounter</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
walk back to the city was better than two miles,
across low hills that worked the ache out of Mat&rsquo;s leg and put
it back again before they topped a rise and saw Ebou Dar ahead,
behind its extravagantly thick, white-plastered wall that no siege
catapult had ever been able to break down. The city within was
white, too, though here and there pointed domes bore thin stripes
of color. The white-plastered buildings, white spires and towers,
white palaces, gleamed even on a gray winter day. Here and there a
tower ended in a jagged top or a gap showed where a building had
been destroyed, but in truth, the Seanchan conquest had occasioned
little damage. They had been too fast, too strong, and in control
of the city before more than scattered resistance could form.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, such trade as there was this time of
year had hardly faltered with the city&rsquo;s fall. The Seanchan
encouraged it, though merchants and ship captains and crews were
required to take an oath to obey the Forerunners, await the Return,
and serve Those Who Come Home. In practice, that meant largely
going about your life as usual, so few objected. The broad harbor
was more crowded with ships every time Mat looked at it. This
afternoon, it seemed he could have walked from Ebou Dar proper
across to the Rahad, a rough quarter he would just as soon never
revisit. Often in the days after he first managed to walk again, he
had gone down to the docks to stare. Not at the vessels with ribbed
sails or the Sea Folk ships that the Seanchan were re-rigging and
manning with their own crews, but at craft flying the Golden Bees
of Illian, or the Sword and Hand of Arad Doman, or the Crescents of
Tear. He no longer did. Today, he barely glanced toward the harbor.
Those dice spinning in his head seemed to roar like thunder.
Whatever was going to happen, he very much doubted he would like
it. He seldom did, when the dice gave warning.</p>

<p>Though a steady stream of traffic flowed out of the
great arched gateway, and people afoot seemed to be squeezing
through to get in, a thick column of wagons and ox-carts,
stretching all the way back to the rise, was waiting to enter and
hardly moving. Everyone departing on a horse was Seanchan, whether
with skin as dark as one of the Sea Folk or pale as a Cairhienin,
and they stood out for more than being mounted. Some of the men
wore voluminous trousers and odd, tight coats with high collars
that fit their necks snugly right to the chin and rows of shiny
metal buttons down the front, or flowing, elaborately embroidered
coats almost as long as a woman&rsquo;s dress. They were of the
Blood, as were the women in strangely cut riding dresses that
seemed made of narrow pleats, with divided skirts cut to expose
colorfully booted ankles and wide sleeves that hung to their feet
in the stirrups. A few wore lace veils that hid all but their eyes,
so their faces were not exposed to the lowborn. Most of the riders
by far, however, wore brightly painted armor of overlapping plates.
Some of the soldiers were women, too, though there was no way to
tell which with those painted helmets like the heads of monstrous
insects. At least none wore the black-and-red of the Deathwatch
Guard. Even other Seanchan seemed nervous around them, and that was
enough to warn Mat to walk wide around them.</p>

<p>In any case, none of the Seanchan spared so much as a
glance for three men and a boy slowly walking toward the city along
the column of waiting carts and wagons. Well, the men walked
slowly. Olver skipped. Mat&rsquo;s leg was setting their pace, but
he tried not to let the others see how much he was leaning on his
staff. The dice usually announced incidents he managed to survive
by the skin of his teeth, battles, a building dropping on his head,
Tylin. He dreaded what would happen when they stopped this
time.</p>

<p>Nearly all of the wagons and carts leaving the city
had Seanchan driving or walking alongside, more plainly dressed
than those on horses, hardly peculiar looking at all, but those in
the waiting line were more likely to belong to Ebou Dari or folk
from the surrounding area, men in long vests, women with their
skirts sewn up on one side to expose a stockinged leg or colorful
petticoats, their wagons as well as their carts pulled by oxen.
Outlanders dotted the column, merchants with small trains of
horse-drawn wagons. There was more trade in winter here in the
south than farther north, where merchants had to contend with
snow-covered roads, and they came from far, some of them. A stout
Domani woman with a dark beauty patch on her copper cheek, riding
the lead of four wagons, clutched her flowered cloak around her and
scowled at a man five wagons ahead of her in the line, a
greasy-looking fellow, hiding long thick mustaches behind a
Taraboner veil, beside the wagon driver. A competitor, no doubt. A
lean Kandori with a large pearl in her left ear and silver chains
across her chest sat her saddle calmly, gloved hand folded on the
pommel, maybe still unaware that her gray gelding and her wagon
teams alike would be put into the lottery once she was into the
city. One horse in five had been taken from locals, and so as not
to discourage trade, one in ten from outlanders. Paid for, true,
and a fair price in other days, but not nearly what the market
would bear, given the demand. Mat always noticed horses, even if
with only half his mind or less. A fat Cairhienin in a coat as drab
as those of his wagon drivers was shouting angrily about the delay
and letting his fine bay mare dance nervously. A very good
conformation on that mare. She would go to an officer, most likely.
What was going to happen when the dice stopped?</p>

<p>The wide arched gates into the city had their guards,
though it was likely only the Seanchan recognized them as such.
<em>Sul&rsquo;dam</em> in their lightning-paneled blue dresses
threaded back and forth through the streams of traffic with
gray-clad <em>damane</em> on silvery <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>. Just one
of those pairs would have been sufficient to quell any disturbance
short of a full-scale assault, and maybe even that, but that was
not the real reason for their presence. In the first days after
Ebou Dar&rsquo;s fall, while he was still confined to bed, they had
harrowed the city searching for the women they called <em>
marath&rsquo;damane</em>, and now they made sure none could enter.
The <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> each carried an extra leash coiled on her
shoulder just in case. Pairs patrolled the docks, too, meeting
every arriving ship and boat.</p>

<p>Beside the wide arched gate into the city, a long
platform displayed, on spikes twenty feet above the ground, the
tarred but still recognizable heads of over a dozen men and two
women who had fallen afoul of Seanchan justice. Above them hung the
symbol for that justice, a headsman&rsquo;s slant-edged axe with the
haft wrapped in an intricately knotted white cord. A placard below
each head announced the crime that had placed it there, murder or
rape, robbery with violence, assault on one of the Blood. Lesser
offenses brought fines or flogging, or being made <em>
da&rsquo;covale</em>. The Seanchan were evenhanded about it. None of
the Blood themselves were on display&mdash;one of those who earned
execution would be sent back to Seanchan, or strangled with the
white cord&mdash;but three of those heads had been attached to
Seanchan, and the weight of their justice fell on high as well as
low. Two placards marked <span class="smallcaps">rebellion</span> hung below the heads of
the woman who had been Mistress of the Ships to the Atha&rsquo;an
Miere and her Master of the Blades.</p>

<p>Mat had been through that gate often enough that he
barely noticed the display, now. Olver skipped along singing a
rhyming song. Beslan and Thom walked with their heads together, and
once Mat caught a soft &ldquo;risky business&rdquo; from Thom, but he did not
care what they were talking about. Then they were into the long,
dim tunnel that carried the road through the wall, and the rumble
of wagons passing through would have made listening impossible even
had he wanted to. Keeping close to the side, well away from the
wagon wheels, Thom and Beslan forged ahead talking in low murmurs,
Olver darting after them, but when Mat emerged into daylight again,
he walked into Thom&rsquo;s back before he realized that all of them
had stopped, hard beside the tunnel&rsquo;s mouth. On the point of
making a caustic comment, he suddenly saw what they were staring
at. People afoot pushing out of the tunnel behind him shoved them
aside, but he just stared, too.</p>

<p>The streets of Ebou Dar were always full of people,
but not like this, as though a dam had burst and sent a flood of
humanity into the city. The throng packed the street in front of
him from one side to the other, surrounding pools of livestock the
like of which he had never seen before, spotted white cattle with
long upswept horns, pale brown goats covered in fine hair that hung
to the paving stones, sheep with four horns. Every street he could
see looked as jammed. Wagons and carts inched through the mass
where they moved at all, the shouts and curses of the wagon drivers
and carters all but drowned in the babble of voices and the noise
of the animals. He could not make out words, but he could
distinguish accents. Slow, drawling Seanchan accents. Some of them
nudged a neighbor and pointed at him in his bright clothing. They
were gaping and pointing at everything, as if they had never seen
an inn or a cutler&rsquo;s shop before, but he still growled under
his breath and jerked his hat brim low over his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Return,&rdquo; Thom muttered, and if Mat had not been
right at his shoulder he would not have heard. &ldquo;While we were
taking our ease with Luca, the <em>Corenne</em> has arrived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat had been thinking of this Return that the
Seanchan kept going on about as an invasion, an army. One of the
wagon drivers shouted and waved her long-handled whip at some boys
who had crawled up on the side of the wagon box to poke at what
appeared to be grapevines in wooden tubs of earth. Another wagon
held a long printing press, and still another, just managing to
turn into the tunnel, carried what looked like brewers&rsquo; vats
and a faint smell of hops. Crates of strangely colored chickens and
ducks and geese decorated some of those wagons, not birds for sale,
but a farmer&rsquo;s stock. It was an army all right, only not the
sort he had imagined. This kind of army would be harder to fight
than soldiers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stab my eyes, we&rsquo;ll have to wade to get though
this!&rdquo; Beslan grumbled in disgust, rising on his toes to try
peering farther ahead over the crowd. &ldquo;How far before we find a
clear street?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat found himself remembering what he had not really
seen when it was in front of his eyes, the harbor full of ships.
<em>Full</em> of ships. Maybe two or three times the vessels that
had been there when they left for Luca&rsquo;s camp at first light,
quite a few of them still maneuvering under sail. Which meant there
might be more still waiting to enter the harbor. Light! How
many could have disgorged their cargo since morning? How many
remained to be unloaded? Light, how many people could be carried on
that number of ships? And why had they all come here instead of
Tanchico? A shiver ran down his spine. Maybe this was not all
of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had best try to find your way by back streets
and alleys,&rdquo; he said, raising his voice so they could hear over the
cacophony. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t reach the Palace before night,
otherwise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beslan turned a frown on him. &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t
returning with us? Mat, if you try to buy passage on a ship again&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;You know she won&rsquo;t go easy on you this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat matched the Queen&rsquo;s son scowl for scowl. &ldquo;I
just want to walk around a little,&rdquo; he lied. As soon as he returned
to the Palace, Tylin would start cosseting and petting him. It
would not have been that bad, really&mdash;not really&mdash;except that she did not care who saw her caress his cheeks and
whisper endearments in his ear, even her son. Besides, what if the
dice in his head stopped when he reached her? Possessive was hardly
the word for Tylin these days. Blood and ashes, the woman might
have decided to marry him! He did not want to marry, not yet, but
he knew who he was going to marry, and it was not Tylin Quintara
Mitsobar. Only, what could he do if she decided differently?</p>

<p>Suddenly he remembered Thom&rsquo;s murmur of &ldquo;risky
business.&rdquo; He knew Thom, and he knew Beslan. Olver was gaping at
the Seanchan as hard as they themselves were at everything around
them. He started to dart away for a closer look, and Mat seized his
shoulder just in time and pushed him, protesting, into Thom&rsquo;s
hands. &ldquo;Take the boy back to the Palace and give him his lessons
when Riselle is done with him. And forget whatever madness you have
in mind. You could put your heads on display outside the gate, and
Tylin&rsquo;s, too.&rdquo; And his own. Never let that be forgotten!</p>

<p>The two men stared back at him without any
expression, as good as confirming his suspicions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I should walk with you,&rdquo; Thom said at last.
&ldquo;We could talk. You&rsquo;re remarkably lucky, Mat, and you have a
certain flair for, shall we say, the adventurous?&rdquo; Beslan nodded.
Olver squirmed in Thom&rsquo;s grip, trying to stare at all the
strange people at once and unconcerned with what his elders were
talking about.</p>

<p>Mat grunted sourly. Why did people always want him to
be a hero? Sooner or later that sort of thing was going to get him
killed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to talk about anything. They are here,
Beslan. If you couldn&rsquo;t stop them getting in, sure as morning,
you won&rsquo;t be able to push them out. Rand will deal with them,
if the rumors are anything to go by.&rdquo; Again, those whirling colors
spun through his head, almost obliterating the sound of the dice
for an instant. &ldquo;You took that bloody oath to wait on the Return;
we all did.&rdquo; Refusal had meant being put in chains and set to work
on the docks, or clearing the canals in the Rahad. Which made it no
oath at all, in his book. &ldquo;Wait on Rand.&rdquo; The colors came once more
and vanished. Blood and ashes! He just had to stop thinking about&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;About certain people. Again they swirled. &ldquo;It might come out
right yet, if you give it time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand, Mat,&rdquo; Beslan said
fiercely. &ldquo;Mother still sits on the throne, and Suroth says she
will rule all of Altara, not just what we hold around Ebou Dar, and
maybe more besides, but mother had to lie down on her <em>face</em>
and swear <em>fealty</em> to some woman on the other side of the
Aryth Ocean. Suroth says I should marry one of their Blood and
shave the sides of my head, and mother is listening to her. Suroth
might pretend they are equals, but she <em>has</em> to listen when
Suroth speaks. No matter what Suroth says, Ebou Dar isn&rsquo;t
really ours anymore, and the rest won&rsquo;t be either. Maybe we
can&rsquo;t push them out by force of arms, but we can make the
country too hot to hold them. The Whitecloaks found out. Ask them
what they mean by &lsquo;the Altaran Noon.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat could guess without asking anyone. He bit his
tongue to keep from pointing out that there were more Seanchan
soldiers in Ebou Dar than there had been Whitecloaks in all of
Altara during the Whitecloak War. A street full of Seanchan was no
place for a flapping tongue, even if most did appear to be farmers
and craftsfolk. &ldquo;I understand you&rsquo;re hot to put your head on
a spike,&rdquo; he said quietly. As quietly as he could and still be
heard in that din of voices and cattle lowing and geese honking.
&ldquo;You know about their Listeners. That fellow over there who looks
like a stableman could be one, or that skinny woman with the bundle
on her back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beslan glowered so hard at the pair Mat had pointed
out that if they really were Listeners, they might report him for
that alone. &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll sing a different song when they
reach Andor,&rdquo; he growled, and pushed his way into the throng,
shoving anyone who got in his way. Mat would have been unsurprised
to see a fight break out. He suspected that was what the man was
looking for.</p>

<p>Thom turned to follow with Olver, but Mat caught his
sleeve. &ldquo;Cool his temper if you can, Thom. And cool your own while
you&rsquo;re about it. I would think by this time you&rsquo;d have
had enough of shaving blind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My head is cool and I&rsquo;m trying to cool his,&rdquo;
Thom said dryly. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t just sit, though; it is his
country.&rdquo; A faint smile crossed his leathery face. &ldquo;You say you
won&rsquo;t take risks, but you will. And when you do, you&rsquo;ll
make anything Beslan and I might try look like an evening stroll in
the garden. With you around, even the barber is blind. Come along,
boy,&rdquo; he said, swinging Olver up onto his shoulders. &ldquo;Riselle might
not let you rest your head if you&rsquo;re late for your
lesson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat frowned after him as he strode away, making much
better progress with Olver straddling his neck than Beslan had.
What did Thom mean? He never took risks unless they were forced on
him. Never. He glanced casually toward the skinny woman, and the
fellow with dung on his boots. Light, they <em>could</em> be
Listeners. Anybody could be. It was enough to set a prickle between
his shoulders, as if he were being watched.</p>

<p>He inched a goodly distance along streets that
actually grew thicker with people and animals and wagons the nearer
he came to the docks. The stalls on the bridges over the canals had
their shutters down, the street peddlers had picked up their
blankets, and the tumblers and jugglers that usually entertained at
every street crossing would have had no room to perform if they had
not gone away, too. There were too many Seanchan, that was how many
there were, and maybe one in five a soldier, plain enough by their
hard eyes and the set of their shoulders, so different from farmer
or craftsman, even when they were not wearing armor. Now and then a
group of <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> and <em>damane</em> moved along the
street in a little eddy of clear space, more even than soldiers
got. It was not given out of fear, at least not by the Seanchan.
They bowed respectfully to the women with lightning-marked red
panels on the blue dresses, and smiled with approval as the pairs
passed by. Beslan was out of his mind. The Seanchan were not going
to be driven off by anyone except an army with Asha&rsquo;man, like
the one rumor said had fought them to the east a week ago. Or one
armed with the Illuminator&rsquo;s secrets. What in the Light could
Aludra want with a bellfounder?</p>

<p>He took pains not to come in sight of the docks. He
had learned his lesson on that. What he really wanted was a game of
dice, one that would last well into the night. Preferably late
enough that Tylin would be asleep when he returned to the Palace.
She had taken away his dice, claiming she did not like him
gambling, though she did it after he talked her into wagering
forfeits, while he was still confined to bed. Fortunately, dice
could always be found, and with his luck, it was always better to
use the other men&rsquo;s dice anyway. Unfortunately, once he
discovered she was not about to pay a forfeit of letting him go&mdash;the woman pretended not to know what he was talking about!&mdash;he had used them to give her back a bit other own medicine.
A grave mistake, however much fun it had been at the time. Since
the forfeits ran out, she had been twice as bad as before.</p>

<p>The taverns and common rooms he entered were as
packed as the streets, though, with barely room to lift a mug, much
less toss dice, full of Seanchan laughing and singing, and
glum-faced Ebou Dari who eyed the Seanchan in sullen silence. He
still queried the innkeepers and tapsters on the chance they might
have a cubby hole he could rent, but one and all they shook their
heads. He had not really expected anything else. There had been
nothing available even before all the new arrivals. Still, he began
to feel as gloomy as the foreign merchants he saw peering into
their wine and wondering how they were to get their goods out of
the city with no horses. He had gold to pay whatever Luca wanted,
and more, but it was all in a chest in the Tarasin Palace, and he
was not about to try taking enough out in one go, not after Palace
servants had <em>carried</em> him back from the docks like a stag
taken in hunt. All he had been doing then was talking to ship
captains; if Tylin learned, and she would, that he was trying to
leave the Palace with more gold than he needed for an evening of
gambling&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Oh, no! He had to have a room, a garret in some
inn&rsquo;s attic the size of a wardrobe, anything, where he could
hide away gold a little at a time, or he had to have a chance with
the dice, one or the other. Luck or no luck, though, he eventually
realized that he was going to find neither today. And those bloody
dice were still tumbling in his head, tumbling.</p>

<p>He did not stay in any one place long, and not just
for the lack of a game or a room. His colorful clothes, his
shame-a-Tinker-for-brightness clothes, drew eyes. Some of the
Seanchan thought he was there for entertainment, and tried to pay
him to sing! He almost let them, once or twice, but once they heard
him, they would have demanded the money back. Some of the Ebou Dari
men, with long curved knives tucked behind their belts and a
bellyful of anger they could not take out on the Seanchan, thought
to take it out on the buffoon who lacked only a painted face to
look like a noble&rsquo;s fool. Mat ducked back into the crowded
street whenever he saw such fellows eyeing him. He had learned the
hard way that he was in no condition for a fight yet, and his
killer&rsquo;s head going up beside the city gate would do him no
good at all.</p>

<p>Mat took rest where he could find it, on an empty
barrel abandoned beside the mouth of an alleyway, on the rare bit
of bench in front of a tavern that had room for one more, on a
stone step until the building&rsquo;s owner came out and knocked his
hat off with a swipe of her broom. His belly was kissing his
backbone, he was beginning to feel that everyone was gaping at his
garish clothes, the dank cold was seeping into his bones, and the
only dice he was going to find were those still thundering away in
his head like horse&rsquo;s hooves. He did not think they had ever
been this loud before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing for it but to go back and be the
Queen&rsquo;s bloody pet!&rdquo; he growled, using his staff to lever
himself up off a cracked wooden crate lying at the side of the
street. Several passersby looked at him as if his face were already
painted. He ignored them. Beneath his notice, they were. He was not
beating them over the head with his staff as they deserved,
goggling at a man that way.</p>

<p>The streets really were as full as earlier, he
realized, and it would be well after nightfall before he got back
to the Palace if he tried to make his way through the crowds. Of
course, Tylin might be asleep by then. Maybe. His stomach growled,
almost loudly enough to drown out the dice. She might order the
kitchens not to feed him, if he was too late.</p>

<p>Ten hard-won paces through the press, and he turned
down an alley, narrow and dark. There were no paving stones. The
white plaster on the windowless walls was cracked and falling to
expose the brick beneath, often as not. The air was rank with the
fetid stench of decay, and he hoped that what squished under his
boots was mud even when it gave off a loathsome odor. There were no
people, either. He could step out with a good stride. Or what
passed for one, today. He could hardly wait for the day he could
walk a few miles again without panting and aching and needing to
lean on a stick. Twisting alleys, most so narrow his shoulders
brushed both sides, crisscrossed the city in a maze that was easy
to get lost in if you did not know your way. He never took a wrong
turn, even when a narrow, crooked passage suddenly forked into
three or even four that all seemed to meander in roughly the same
direction. There had been a good many times in Ebou Dar when he
needed to avoid eyes, and he knew these alleys like he knew his own
hand. Though, oddly enough, he still had the feeling he was being
watched. He expected to feel that as long as he had to wear those
bloody clothes.</p>

<p>If he had to struggle through a mass of people and
animals from one alley to another, and occasionally shove his way
across a bridge that seemed a solid wall of humanity, he was still
almost back to the Palace in the time it would have taken him to go
three streets otherwise. Hurrying into the shadowed passage between
a well-lit tavern and a shuttered lacquerware shop, he wondered
what the kitchens would have ready. More capacious than most, wide
enough for three if they were friendly, this alley let out onto the
Mol Hara Square almost in front of the Tarasin Palace. Suroth was
living there, and the cooks had been outdoing themselves since she
had had the lot of them flogged after her first meal. There might
be oysters with cream, and perhaps gilded fish, and squid with
peppers. Ten strides into the shadows, his foot came down on
something that did not squish, and he went down in the freezing mud
with a grunt, twisting at the last instant so he did not land on
his bad leg. Icy liquid immediately soaked through his coat. He
hoped it was water.</p>

<p>He grunted again when boots landed on his shoulder.
The fellow toppled off of him, cursing and skidding deeper into the
alley on the mud, and went to one knee, just managing to catch
himself against the side of the tavern short of falling flat
himself. Mat&rsquo;s eyes were accustomed to the dim light, enough
for him to make out a slender, nondescript man. A man with what
appeared to be a large scar on his cheek. Not a man, though. A
creature he had seen rip out his friend&rsquo;s throat with one bare
hand and take a knife out of its own chest and throw it back at
him. And the thing would have landed right in front of him, in easy
reach, if he had not tripped. Maybe a little twist of <em>
ta&rsquo;veren</em> shaping had worked in his favor, thank the
Light! All that flashed through his head in the time it took the
<em>gholam</em> to catch itself against the wall and turn its head
to glare at him.</p>

<p>With an oath, Mat snatched his fallen walking staff
and awkwardly hurled it at the creature like a spear. At its legs,
hoping to tangle them, gain a moment. The thing flowed aside like
water, avoiding the staff, boots sliding a little in the mud, then
threw itself toward Mat. The delay had been enough, though. As soon
as the staff left his hand, Mat fumbled inside his shirt for the
foxhead medallion, breaking the leather cord as he snatched the
medallion out. The <em>gholam</em> threw itself at him, and he
swung the medallion desperately. Silver that had lain cool on his
chest brushed across an outstretched hand with a hiss like bacon
frying and a smell of burning flesh. Fluid as quicksilver,
snarling, the thing tried to dodge by the whirling medallion, to
seize some part of Mat. Once it laid hands on him, he was as good
as dead. It would not try to toy with him this time, as it had in
the Rahad. Flailing continuously, he caught it with the foxhead on
the other hand, across the face, each time with a hiss and stench
of burning as if he had struck with a hot iron. Teeth bared, the
<em>gholam</em> backed away, but in a crouch on the balls of its
feet, hands clawed, ready to jump at the slightest weakness.</p>

<p>Not letting the spinning medallion slow, Mat pushed
unsteadily to his feet, watching the thing that looked a like a
man. <em>He wants you dead as much as he wants her</em>, it had
told him in the Rahad, smiling. It was not talking or smiling now.
He did not know who the &ldquo;her&rdquo; was, or the &ldquo;he,&rdquo; but the rest was
clear as good glass. And here he was, barely able to stay on his
feet. His leg and hip ached like fire, and his ribs. Not to mention
the shoulder the <em>gholam</em> had landed on. He had to get back
to the street, back among people. Maybe enough people would deter
the thing. A small hope, but the only hope he could see. The street
was not far. He could hear the babble of voices, hardly softened by
distance at all.</p>

<p>He took a careful step backward. His boot slid in
something that gave off a foul smell and threw him against the
tavern&rsquo;s wall. Only frantic swings of the silver foxhead kept
the <em>gholam</em> back. Those voices in the street were so
tantalizingly close. They might as well have been in Barsine.
Barsine was long dead, and he would be too soon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s down this alley!&rdquo; a man shouted. &ldquo;Follow
me! Hurry! He&rsquo;ll get away!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat kept his eyes on the <em>gholam</em>. Its gaze
flickered beyond him, toward the street, and it hesitated. &ldquo;I am
ordered to avoid notice, save by those I harvest,&rdquo; it spat at him,
&ldquo;so you will live a little longer. A little longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Spinning, it ran down the alley, slipping a little in
the mud, yet still seeming to flow as it dodged around behind the
tavern.</p>

<p>Mat ran after it. He could not have said why, except
that it had tried to kill him, would try again, and his hackles
were stiff. So it was going to kill him at leisure, was it? If the
medallion could hurt it, maybe the medallion could kill it.</p>

<p>Reaching the corner of the tavern, he saw the <em>
gholam</em> at the same time that it glanced back and saw him.
Again, the thing hesitated for an instant. The tavern&rsquo;s back
door stood ajar, letting out the sounds of revelry. The creature
stuck its hands into a hole left by a missing brick in the back
wall of the building opposite the tavern, and Mat stiffened. It
hardly seemed to need weapons, but if it had hidden one in there&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He did not think he would survive facing that thing with any
sort of weapon. Hands followed arms, and then the <em>
gholam</em>&rsquo;s head went into the hole. Mat&rsquo;s jaw dropped.
The <em>gholam</em>&rsquo;s chest slithered through, its legs, and
it was gone. Through an opening maybe the size of Mat&rsquo;s two
hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I have ever seen the like,&rdquo;
someone said quietly beside him, and Mat gave a start at realizing
he was no longer alone. The speaker was a stoop-shouldered,
white-haired old man with a large hooked nose planted in the middle
of a sad face and a bundle slung on his back. He was sliding a very
long dagger into a sheath beneath his coat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; Mat said hollowly. &ldquo;In Shadar Logoth.&rdquo;
Sometimes bits of his own memory he thought lost floated up out of
no where, and that one had just surfaced, watching the <em>
gholam</em>. It was one memory he wished had remained lost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not many survive a visit there,&rdquo; the old man said,
peering at him. His weathered face looked familiar, somehow, but
Mat could not place him. &ldquo;Whatever took you to Shadar Logoth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are your friends?&rdquo; Mat said. &ldquo;The people you
were shouting to?&rdquo; The alleyway held only the two of them. The
sounds from the street continued unabated, and undisturbed by any
cries about anyone getting away if they did not hurry.</p>

<p>The old man shrugged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not certain anyone
out there understood what I was shouting. It&rsquo;s hard enough
understanding them. Anyway, I thought it might scare off the
fellow. Seeing that, though&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Gesturing toward the hole in the
wall, he laughed mirthlessly, showing gaps in his teeth. &ldquo;I think
maybe you and I both have the Dark One&rsquo;s own luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat grimaced. He had heard that too often about
himself, and he did not like it. Mainly because he was not sure it
was not true. &ldquo;Maybe we do,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Forgive me; I should
introduce myself to the man who saved my neck. I&rsquo;m Mat
Cauthon. Are you new-come to Ebou Dar?&rdquo; That bundle strapped to the
fellow&rsquo;s back gave him the look of a man on the move. &ldquo;You
will have a hard time finding a place to sleep.&rdquo; He took care with
the gnarled hand the other man put in his. It was all knobs, as if
every bone had been broken at the same time and had healed badly.
It had a strong grip, though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Noal Charin, Mat Cauthon. No, I have been here
some time. But my pallet in the attic of The Golden Ducks is now
occupied by a fat Illianer oil merchant who was rousted from his
room this morning in favor of a Seanchan officer. I thought
I&rsquo;d find somewhere back in this alley for tonight.&rdquo; Rubbing
the side of his big nose with a crooked, knobby finger, he chuckled
as if sleeping in an alley were of no moment. &ldquo;It will not be the
first time I&rsquo;ve slept rough, even in a city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I can do better for you than that,&rdquo; Mat told
him, but the rest of what he had been going to say died on his
tongue. The dice were still spinning in his head, he realized. He
had managed to forget them with the <em>gholam</em> trying to kill
him, but they were still bouncing, still waiting to land. If they
were warning of something worse than the <em>gholam</em>, he did
not want to know. Only, he would. There was no doubt of that. He
would, when it was too late.</p>
