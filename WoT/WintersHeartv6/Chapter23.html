<h4><em>To Lose the Sun</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>rying
to hold the unfamiliar woolen cloak tightly
around her with one hand, trying not to fall out of the even more
unfamiliar saddle, Shalon awkwardly heeled her horse forward and
followed Harine and her Swordmaster Moad through the hole in the
air that led from a stableyard in the Sun Palace to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She was
not sure where, except that it was a long open area&mdash;a
clearing, was it called? she thought that was right&mdash;a
clearing larger than a raker&rsquo;s deck, among stunted trees
spaced out on hills. The pines, the only trees among them she
recognized, were too small and twisted for any use but tar and
turpentine. Most of the rest showed bare gray branches that made
her think of bones. The morning sun sat just above the treetops,
and if anything, the cold seemed more bitter here than it had in
the city she had left behind. She hoped the horse did not misstep
and tumble her down onto the rocks that stuck up wherever patches
of snow did not cover the rotting leaves on the ground. She
distrusted horses. Unlike ships, animals had minds of their own.
They were treacherous things to climb on top of. And horses had
teeth. Whenever her mount showed his, so near to her legs, she
flinched and patted his neck and made soothing sounds. At least,
she hoped the beast found them soothing.</p>

<p>Cadsuane herself, garbed in unrelieved dark green,
sat easily on a tall horse with a black mane and tail, maintaining
the weave that made the gateway. Horses did not bother her. Nothing
bothered her. A sudden breeze stirred the dark gray cloak spread
over the back end of her mount, but she gave no sign of feeling the
cold at all. The golden hair ornaments dangling around her dark
gray bun swung as she turned her head to watch Shalon and her
companions. She was a handsome woman, but not one you would notice
twice in a crowd except that her smooth face did not match her
hair. Once you came to know her, it was too late.</p>

<p>Shalon would have given much to see how that weave
was done, even if it had meant being near Cadsuane, but she had not
been allowed into the stableyard until the gateway was complete,
and seeing a sail spread on the yardarm did not teach you how to
set a sail much less make one. All she knew was the name. Riding
past, she avoided meeting the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s gaze, but she felt
it. The woman&rsquo;s eyes made her toes curl, seeking a footing the
stirrups could not give. She could see no way to escape, yet she
hoped to find one through studying the Aes Sedai. That she knew
very little about Aes Sedai, she was readily willing to admit&mdash;she had never met one before sailing to Cairhien, and
thought about them only to praise the Light that she had not been
chosen to become one&mdash;but there were currents among
Cadsuane&rsquo;s companions, deep beneath the surface. Deep, strong
currents could alter everything that seemed apparent on the
surface.</p>

<p>The four Aes Sedai who had come through right after
Cadsuane were waiting on their horses at one side of the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;clearing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;with three Warders. At least, Shalon was sure that
Ihvon was the fiery Alanna&rsquo;s Warder, and Tomas was stout
little Verin&rsquo;s, but she also was sure she had seen the very
young man who stayed so close to plump Daigian&rsquo;s side wearing
an Asha&rsquo;man&rsquo;s black coat. Surely he could not be a
Warder. Could he? Eben was just a boy. Yet when the woman gazed at
him, her usual puffed-up pride seemed to swell further. Kumira, a
pleasant-looking woman with blue eyes that could turn into knives
when something interested her, sat her saddle a little to one side,
studying young Eben so sharply it was a wonder he was not lying on
the ground flensed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not put up with this much longer,&rdquo; Harine
grumbled, thumping her mare with her bare heels to keep it moving.
Her brocaded yellow silks did not help her keep a good seat in the
saddle any more than did Shalon&rsquo;s blue. She swayed and slid
with the animal&rsquo;s movements, on the point of toppling to the
ground at every step. The breeze gusted again, flipping the
dangling ends of her sash about, making her cloak billow, but she
disdained to control the garment. Cloaks were not much used in the
ships; they got in the way, and could tangle your arms and legs
when you needed them for survival. Moad had refused one, trusting
to the quilted blue coat he wore in the coldest seas. Nesune
Bihara, all in bronze wool, rode through the gateway looking around
as if trying to see everything at once, and then Elza Penfel, who
wore a sullen expression for some reason and clutched her fur-lined
green cloak tight. None of the other Aes Sedai seemed to bother
much with sheltering themselves from the cold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>may</em> be able to see the Coramoor, she
says,&rdquo; Harine muttered, pulling at her reins until the mare turned
toward the side of the clearing away from where the Aes Sedai were
gathering. &ldquo;May! And she offers this <em>chance</em> as though
granting a privilege.&rdquo; Harine did not need to give a name; when
Harine said &ldquo;she&rdquo; that way, like a jellyfish&rsquo;s sting, there
could only be one woman she meant. &ldquo;I have the right, bargained for
and agreed! She denies me the agreed entourage! I must leave my
Sailmistress behind, and my attendants!&rdquo; Erian Boroleos appeared
through the opening, as intent as if she expected to find a battle,
followed by Beldeine Nyram, who did not even look like an Aes
Sedai. Both wore green, Erian completely, Beldeine in slashes in
her sleeves and skirts. Did that mean something? Likely not. &ldquo;Am I
to approach the Coramoor like a deckgirl touching my heart to a
Sailmistress?&rdquo; When several Aes Sedai were together, you could see
the smooth-faced agelessness clearly, so you could not say whether
any one was twenty or twice that even if her hair was white, and
Beldeine simply looked a girl of twenty. And that told no more than
did her skirts. &ldquo;Am I to air my own bedding and wash my own linens?
She turns protocol straight into the wind! I will not allow it! No
more!&rdquo; These were old complaints, voiced a dozen times since last
night, when Cadsuane laid down her conditions if they were to
accompany her. Those conditions had been strict, but Harine had had
no choice save to accede, which only added to the bitterness.</p>

<p>Shalon listened with half an ear, nodding and
murmuring the appropriate responses. Agreement, of course. Her
sister expected agreement. Most of her attention was on the Aes
Sedai. Surreptitiously. Moad did not pretend to listen, but then,
he was Harine&rsquo;s Swordmaster. Harine might be tight as a wet
knot with everyone else, yet she gave Moad so much leeway anyone
might have thought the hard-eyed, gray-haired man was her lover,
especially since both were widowed. At least, they might think it
if they did not know Harine. Harine would never take a lover who
stood lower than she, and now, of course, that meant she could take
none. In any case, once they stopped their horses near the trees,
Moad leaned an elbow on the tall pommel of his saddle, rested a
hand on the long, carved ivory hilt of the sword thrust behind his
green sash, and openly studied the Aes Sedai and the men with them.
Where had he learned to ride a horse? He actually looked&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;comfortable. Anyone could tell his rank at a glance, from his eight
earrings of the heaviest weight and the knotting of his sash, even
if he was not wearing his sword and matching dagger. Did Aes Sedai
have no way to do the same? Could they truly be so disorganized?
Supposedly the White Tower was like some mechanical contrivance
that ground up thrones and reshaped them to its will. Of course,
the machinery did seem to be broken, now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said, where has she brought us, Shalon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harine&rsquo;s voice, like an icy razor, drained the
blood from Shalon&rsquo;s face. Serving under a younger sibling was
always difficult, but Harine made it more so. In private she was
beyond cool, and in public she was capable of having a Sailmistress
hung up by the ankles, not to mention a Windfinder. And since that
young shorebound woman, Min, had told her she would be Mistress of
the Ships one day, she had grown ever sharper. Staring hard-eyed at
Shalon, she raised her golden scent-box as if to cover an
unpleasant odor, though the cold killed all the perfume.</p>

<p>Hurriedly Shalon looked into the sky, trying to judge
the sun. She wished her sextant were not locked away on <em>White
Spray</em>&mdash;the shorebound were never allowed to see a
sextant, much less see one being used&mdash;but she was uncertain
it would have done her any good. These trees might be short, but
she still could not make out a horizon. Close on to the north, the
hills rose into mountains that slanted northeast to southwest. She
could not say how high she was. There was far too much up and down
about landside to suit her. Even so, any Windfinder knew how to
make rough approximations. And when Harine demanded information,
she expected to receive it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can only guess, Wavemistress,&rdquo; she said.
Harine&rsquo;s jaw tightened, but no Windfinder would present a
guess as a firm position. &ldquo;I believe we are three or four hundred
leagues south of Cairhien. More, I cannot say.&rdquo; Any first-day
apprentice using a string-stick who gave a fix that loose would
have been bent over for the deckmaster&rsquo;s starter, but the
words chilled Shalon&rsquo;s tongue as she heard what she was
saying. A hundred leagues over the full turn of a day was good
sailing for a raker. Moad pursed his lips thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Harine nodded slowly, looking right through Shalon as
though she could see rakers under full sail gliding through holes
woven in the air with the Power. The seas truly would be theirs,
then. Giving herself a shake, she leaned toward Shalon, her eyes
catching Shalon&rsquo;s like hooks. &ldquo;You must learn this, whatever
the cost. Tell her you will spy on me if she teaches you. If you
convince her, she might, the Light willing. Or at least you may get
close enough to one of the others to learn it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shalon licked her lips. She hoped Harine had not seen
her jerk. &ldquo;I refused her before, Wavemistress.&rdquo; She had needed some
explanation of why the Aes Sedai had held her for a week, and a
version of the truth had seemed safest. Harine knew everything.
Except the secret Verin had winkled out. Except that Shalon had
agreed to Cadsuane&rsquo;s demands in order to hide that secret. The
Grace of the Light be upon her, she regretted Ailil, but she had
been so lonely that she sailed too far before she knew it. With
Harine, there were no evening talks over honeyed wine to soften the
long months parted from her husband Mishael. At best, many more
months would pass before she could lie in his arms. &ldquo;With respect,
why should she believe me now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you want the learning.&rdquo; Harine chopped the
air with one hand. &ldquo;The shorebound always believe greed. You will
have to tell some things, of course, to prove yourself. I will
decide what each day. Perhaps I can steer her where I wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hard fingers seemed to dig into Shalon&rsquo;s scalp.
She had intended to tell Cadsuane as little as she could get by
with, and as seldom, until she found a way free of her. If she had
to talk with the Aes Sedai every day, and worse, lie to her
outright, the woman would pry out more than Shalon wanted. More
than Harine wanted. Much more. It was as certain as sunrise.
&ldquo;Forgive me, Wavemistress,&rdquo; she said with every ounce of deference
she could find, &ldquo;but if I may be allowed to say so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She cut off as Sarene Nemdahl rode up and reined to a
halt before them. The last of the Aes Sedai and Warders had come
through, and Cadsuane had let the gateway vanish. Corele, a thin
woman if pretty, was laughing and tossing her mane of black hair as
she spoke to Kumira. Merise, a tall woman with eyes bluer than
Kumira&rsquo;s and a more than handsome face that was stern enough
to give even Harine pause, was using sharp gestures to direct the
four men leading packhorses. Everyone else was gathering reins. It
seemed they were all getting ready to leave the clearing.</p>

<p>Sarene was lovely, though the absence of jewelry
lessened her looks, of course, as did the plain white dress she
wore. The shore-bound seemed to have no joy of color at all. Even
her dark cloak was lined with white fur. &ldquo;Cadsuane, she has asked&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;instructed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;me to be your attendant, Wavemistress,&rdquo; she
said, inclining her head respectfully. &ldquo;I will answer your
questions, to the extent that I can, and help you with the customs,
as well as I know them. I realize you might feel discomfort at
being with me, but when Cadsuane commands, we must obey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shalon smiled. She doubted the Aes Sedai knew that in
the ships, an attendant was what the shorebound would call a
servant. Harine would probably laugh and demand to know whether the
Aes Sedai could clean linens properly. It would be good to have her
in a good mood.</p>

<p>Rather than laughing, though, Harine stiffened in her
saddle as though her backbone had become a mainmast, and her eyes
popped. &ldquo;I feel no discomfort!&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;I simply prefer to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to put any questions to someone else&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to Cadsuane. Yes. To
Cadsuane. And <em>I</em> certainly do not have to obey her or
anyone! Not anyone! Except the Mistress of the Ships!&rdquo; Shalon
frowned; it was unlike her sister to sound scatter-witted. Drawing
a deep breath, Harine continued in a firmer tone, though in a way,
just as oddly as before. &ldquo;I speak for the Mistress of the Ships to
the Atha&rsquo;an Miere, and I demand due respect! I demand it, do
you hear me? Do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can ask her to name someone else,&rdquo; Sarene said
doubtfully, as if she did not expect her asking would change
anything. &ldquo;You must understand that she gave me quite specific
instructions that day. But I should not have lost my temper. That
is a failing of mine. Temper destroys logic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand obeying orders,&rdquo; Harine growled,
crouching in the saddle. She looked ready to launch herself at
Sarene&rsquo;s throat. &ldquo;I <em>approve</em> of obeying orders!&rdquo; she
very nearly snarled. &ldquo;However, orders that have been carried out
can be forgotten. They no longer need be spoken of. Do you
understand me?&rdquo; Shalon stared sideways at her. What was she talking
about? What orders had Sarene carried out, and why did Harine want
them forgotten? Moad made no pretence of hiding his raised
eyebrows. Harine was aware of his scrutiny, at least, and her face
became a thunderhead.</p>

<p>Sarene seemed not to notice. &ldquo;I do not see how one
can deliberately forget,&rdquo; she said slowly, a small frown creasing
her forehead, &ldquo;but I suppose you mean that we should pretend to. Is
that it?&rdquo; The beaded braids dangling from her cowl clicked together
as she shook her head at this foolishness. &ldquo;Very well. I will
answer your questions as well as I can. What do you wish to know?&rdquo;
Harine sighed loudly. Shalon might have taken it for impatience,
but she thought it was relief. Relief!</p>

<p>Relieved or not, Harine became her normal self again,
self-possessed and commanding, meeting the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s gaze as
though trying to make her drop her eyes. &ldquo;You can tell me where we
are and where we are going,&rdquo; she demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are in the Hills of
Kintara,&rdquo; Cadsuane said, appearing before them suddenly, her mount
rearing and pawing the air, flinging snow, &ldquo;and we are going to Far
Madding.&rdquo; Not only did she stay in the saddle, she did not even
seem to notice the animal&rsquo;s heaving!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the Coramoor in this Far Madding?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Patience is a virtue, I am told, Wavemistress.&rdquo;
Despite Cadsuane&rsquo;s use of Harine&rsquo;s proper title, there
was no respect in her manner. Far from it. &ldquo;You will ride with me.
Keep up and try not to fall off. It would be unpleasant, if I had
to have you carried like sacks of grain. Once we reach the city,
keep silent unless I tell you to speak. I won&rsquo;t have you
creating problems through ignorance. You will let Sarene guide you.
She has her instructions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shalon expected an outburst of rage, but Harine held
her tongue, though with obvious effort. Once Cadsuane turned away,
Harine did mutter angrily under her breath, but she clamped her
teeth tight when Sarene&rsquo;s horse moved. Plainly, her mutters
were not to be overheard by Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>Riding with Cadsuane, it turned out, meant riding
behind her, southward through the trees. Alanna and Verin actually
rode beside the woman, but one look from her when Harine attempted
to join them made clear that no one else was welcome. Once again
the expected explosion did not come. Instead, Harine frowned at
Sarene for some reason, then jerked her mount around to take
position between Shalon and Moad. She did not bother asking any
further questions of Sarene, on Shalon&rsquo;s other side, only
glowered at the backs of the women ahead. If Shalon had not known
Harine better, she would have said there was more sulk than anger
in that glare.</p>

<p>For her part, Shalon was glad to ride in silence.
Riding a horse was difficult enough without having to talk at the
same time. Besides, she suddenly knew why Harine was behaving in
such a peculiar fashion. Harine must be trying to smooth the waters
with the Aes Sedai. It had to be that. Harine never controlled her
temper without great need. The strain of controlling it now must
have her boiling inside. And if her efforts did not end as she
wanted, she would boil Shalon. Thinking about that made
Shalon&rsquo;s head ache. The Light help and guide her, there had to
be a way to avoid spying on her sister without finding her
cheek-chain stripped of honors and herself assigned to a scow under
a Sailmistress brooding over why she had never risen higher and
ready to take out her grievances on everyone around her. Equally as
bad, Mishael might declare their marriage vows broken. There just
had to be a way.</p>

<p>Sometimes she twisted around in her saddle to look at
the Aes Sedai riding behind her. There was nothing to learn from
the women in front, certainly. Every so often Cadsuane and Verin
exchanged words, but leaning close to one another and speaking too
softly to be overheard. Alanna appeared intent on whatever lay
ahead, her eyes always looking south. Two or three times she
quickened her horse&rsquo;s pace for a few steps before Cadsuane
brought her back with a quiet word that Alanna obeyed reluctantly,
with hot-eyed stare or sullen grimace. Cadsuane and Verin appeared
solicitous of the woman, Cadsuane patting her arm in almost the way
Shalon patted her mount&rsquo;s neck and Verin beaming at her, as
though Alanna were recovering from an illness. Which told Shalon
nothing. So she thought about the others.</p>

<p>You did not rise in the ships just through your
ability to Weave the Winds or predict the weather or fix a
position. You needed to read the intent that lay between the words
of your orders, to interpret small gestures and facial expressions;
you had to notice who deferred to whom, even subtly, for courage
and ability alone took you only so high.</p>

<p>Four of them, Nesune and Erian, Beldeine and Elza,
rode in a cluster not far behind her, though they were not really
together, only occupying the same space. They did not talk among
themselves, or look at one another. They did not seem to like one
another very much. In her mind, Shalon had them in the same boat
with Sarene. The Aes Sedai pretended that they were all one under
Cadsuane, yet that was plainly untrue. Merise, Corele, Kumira and
Daigian crewed another boat, commanded by Cadsuane. Sometimes
Alanna seemed in one boat, sometimes the other, while Verin
appeared to be in some way of Cadsuane&rsquo;s boat but not in it.
Swimming alongside, perhaps, with Cadsuane holding her hand. If
that was not strange enough, there was the matter of deference.</p>

<p>Oddly, it seemed that Aes Sedai valued strength in
the Power above experience or skill. They ranked themselves by
strength, like deckmen squabbling in shoreside taverns. All
deferred to Cadsuane, of course, yet there were oddities among the
rest. By their own hierarchy, some in Nesune&rsquo;s boat were in a
position to expect deference from some in Cadsuane&rsquo;s, but
although those in Cadsuane&rsquo;s boat who should defer did so,
they did so as though to a superior who had committed a grievous
crime known to all. By that hierarchy, Nesune stood higher than any
save Cadsuane and Merise, yet she faced Daigian, who stood at the
very bottom, as if willfully defiant over committing that crime,
and so did the others in her boat. It was all very discreet, a
slightly lifted chin, a small arch of the eyebrow, a twist of the
lips, but obvious to an eye trained climbing in the ships. Perhaps
there was nothing in it that would help her, but if she had to pick
oakum, the only way was to find a thread and pull.</p>

<p>The wind began to pick up; gusts flattened her cloak
against her back and made it flap on either side ahead of her. She
was hardly aware of it.</p>

<p>The Warders might be another thread. They were all at
the very rear, hidden by the Aes Sedai riding behind Nesune and the
other three. In truth, Shalon had expected that among twelve Aes
Sedai, there would be more than seven Warders. Every Aes Sedai was
supposed to have one, if not more. She shook her head irritably.
Except the Red Ajah, of course. She was not <em>entirely</em>
ignorant of Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>Anyway, the question was not how many Warders, but
whether they all <em>were</em> Warders. She was certain she had
seen grizzled old Damer and the so-pretty Jahar in black coats,
too, before they suddenly took up with the Aes Sedai. At the time,
she had been unwilling to look too closely at the blackcoats, and
in truth, she had been half-blind with the dainty Ailil as well,
but she was sure. And whatever the case with Eben, she was almost
certain the other two were Warders, now. Almost. Jahar jumped as
fast as Nethan or Bassane when Merise pointed, and from the way
Corele smiled at Damer, he was either her Warder or her bed-warmer,
and Shalon could not imagine a woman like Corele taking a nearly
bald old man with a limp into her bed. She might know little about
Aes Sedai, but she was sure bonding men who could channel was not
an accepted practice. If she could prove they had done so, perhaps
that was a knife sharp enough to cut herself free from
Cadsuane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The men, they can no longer channel now,&rdquo; Sarene
murmured.</p>

<p>Shalon straightened herself around in the saddle so
quickly that she had to grab her horse&rsquo;s mane with both hands
to keep from falling off. The wind blew her cloak over her head,
and she had to fight that down before she could sit up. They were
coming out of the trees above a wide road that curved southward out
of the hills to a lake perhaps a mile off, on the edge of flat land
covered with brown grass, a sea of brown stretching to the horizon.
The lake, bordered along the west with a narrow wash of reeds, was
a pitiful excuse for a body of water, no more than ten miles long
at most and less than that wide. A fair-sized island crouched in
the middle, surrounded by high, tower-studded walls as far as she
could see, and covered by a city. She took all that in at a glance,
her eyes fastening on Sarene. It was almost as if the woman had
been reading her mind. &ldquo;Why can they not channel?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Did
you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Have you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;gentled&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;them?&rdquo; She thought that was
the right word, but that was supposed to kill the man. She had
always supposed it was just an odd way to soften execution for some
unknown reason.</p>

<p>Sarene blinked, and Shalon realized the Aes Sedai had
been speaking to herself. For a moment she studied Shalon as they
followed Cadsuane down the slope, then turned her gaze back to the
city on the island. &ldquo;You notice things, Shalon. It would be best if
you keep what you have noticed about the men to yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such as them being Warders?&rdquo; Shalon said quietly.
&ldquo;Is that why you could bond them? Because you gentled them?&rdquo; She
hoped to jar some admission loose, but the Aes Sedai merely glanced
at her. She did not speak again until they had reached the bottom
of the hill and turned onto the road behind Cadsuane. The road was
wide, the dirt packed hard by much traffic, but they had it to
themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not exactly a secret,&rdquo; Sarene said at last,
and not very willingly for something that was not a secret, &ldquo;but
neither is it well known. We do not speak of Far Madding often,
except for sisters born there, and even they seldom visit. Still,
you should know before you enter. The city possesses a <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. Or perhaps it is three <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. No one knows. They&mdash;or it&mdash;cannot be studied any more than they can be removed. They must have
been made during the Breaking, when fear of madmen channeling the
Power was the matter of every day. But to pay such a price for the
safety.&rdquo; The beaded braids dangling onto her chest rattled together
as she shook her head in disbelief. &ldquo;These <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, they duplicate a <em>stedding</em>. In the
important ways at least, I fear, though I suppose an Ogier would
not think so.&rdquo; She gave a doleful sigh.</p>

<p>Shalon gaped at her, and exchanged confused looks
with Harine and Moad. Why would fables frighten an Aes Sedai?
Harine opened her mouth, then motioned for Shalon to ask the
obvious question. Perhaps she was to make friends with Sarene to
help smooth her course, too? Shalon&rsquo;s head really did ache.
But she was curious, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What ways are those?&rdquo; she asked carefully. Did the
woman really believe in people five spans tall who sang to trees?
There was something about axes, too. Here come the Aelfinn to steal
all your bread; here come the Ogier to chop off your head. Light,
she had not heard that since Harine was still in leading strings.
With their mother rising in the ships, she had been charged with
raising Harine along with her own first child.</p>

<p>Sarene&rsquo;s eyes widened in surprise. &ldquo;You truly do
not know?&rdquo; Her gaze went back to the island city ahead. By her
expression, she was about to enter the bilges. &ldquo;Inside the <em>
stedding</em>, you cannot channel. You cannot even feel the True
Source. No weave made outside can affect what is inside, not that
that matters. In truth, here there are two <em>stedding</em>, one
within the other. The larger affects men, but we will enter the
smaller before we reach the bridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will not be able to channel in there?&rdquo; Harine
said. When the Aes Sedai nodded without looking away from the city,
a thin frosty smile touched Harine&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;Perhaps after we
find quarters, you and I can discuss instructions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You read the philosophy?&rdquo; Sarene looked startled.
&ldquo;The Theory of Instructions, it is not well thought of these days,
yet I have always believed there was much to learn there. A
discussion will be pleasant, to take my mind from other matters. If
Cadsuane allows us time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harine&rsquo;s mouth fell open. Gaping at the Aes
Sedai, she forgot to cling to her saddle, and only Moad seizing her
arm saved her from a fall.</p>

<p>Shalon had never heard Harine mention philosophy, but
she did not care what her sister was talking about. Staring toward
Far Madding, she swallowed hard. She had learned to sheathe someone
against using the Power, of course, and been sheathed herself as
part of her training, yet when you were sheathed, you could still
feel the Source. What would it be like not to feel it, like the sun
just out of sight beyond the corner of your eye? What would it be
like to lose the sun?</p>

<p>As they rode nearer the lake, she felt more aware of
the Source than she had since her first joy at touching it. It was
all she could do not to drink of it, but the Aes Sedai would see
the light and know, and likely know why. She would not shame
herself or Harine in that manner. Small, beamy craft dotted the
water, none more than six or seven spans in length, some hauling in
nets, others creeping along on long sweeps. Judging by the
windswept swells that rolled across the surface, sometimes crashing
into one another in fountains of foam like surf, sails might have
been as much hindrance as help. Still, the boats seemed almost a
familiar thing, though nothing like the sleek fours or eights or
twelves carried on the ships. A tiny comfort amid strangeness.</p>

<p>The road turned onto a spit of land jutting half a
mile or more into the lake, and abruptly the Source vanished.
Sarene sighed, but gave no other sign she had noticed. Shalon wet
her lips. It was not so bad as she had feared. It made her feel&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;empty&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but she could bear that. As long as she did not have
to bear it too long. The wind, gusting and curling and trying to
steal cloaks, suddenly felt much colder.</p>

<p>At the end of the spit, a village of gray stone
houses with darker slate roofs stood between road and water on one
side. Village women hurrying along with large baskets stopped at
the sight of the mounted party. More than one felt at her own nose
as she stared. Shalon had grown almost accustomed to those stares,
in Cairhien. In any case, the fortification opposite the village
drew her eyes, a mound of tight-fitted stone five spans high with
soldiers watching through the barred faceguards of their helmets
from atop towers at the corners. Some held drawn crossbows where
she could see them. From a large iron-plated door at the end
nearest the bridge, more helmeted soldiers spilled out into the
road, men in square-scaled armor with a golden sword worked on the
left shoulder. Some wore swords at their waists and others carried
long spears or crossbows. Shalon wondered whether they expected the
Aes Sedai to try fighting past. An officer with a yellow plume on
his helmet motioned Cadsuane to a halt, then approached her and
removed his helmet, freeing gray-streaked hair that spilled down
his back to his waist. He had a hard, disgruntled face.</p>

<p>Cadsuane leaned low in her saddle to exchange a few
quiet words with the man, then produced a fat purse from beneath
her saddlebags. He took it and stepped back, motioning one of the
soldiers forward, a tall bony man who was not wearing a helmet. He
carried a writing board, and his hair, gathered at the back of his
head like the officer&rsquo;s, also hung to his waist. He bent his
neck respectfully before inquiring Alanna&rsquo;s name, and wrote it
very carefully, with his tongue caught between his teeth, dipping
his pen often. Helmet on his hip, the discontented officer stood
studying the others behind Cadsuane with no expression. The purse
hung from his hand as though forgotten. He seemed unaware he had
been speaking with an Aes Sedai. Or maybe, he did not care. Here,
an Aes Sedai was no different from any other woman. Shalon
shuddered. Here, she was no different from any other woman, bereft
of her gifts for the duration of her stay. Bereft.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They take the names of all foreigners,&rdquo; Sarene said.
&ldquo;The Counsels, they like to know who is in the city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they would admit a Wavemistress without
bribes,&rdquo; Harine said drily. The bony soldier, turning away from
Alanna, gave the usual shorebound start at Shalon and Harine&rsquo;s
jewelry before coming toward them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your name, Mistress, if it pleases you?&rdquo; he said
politely to Sarene, ducking his head again. She gave it without
mentioning that she was Aes Sedai. Shalon gave hers as simply, but
Harine offered the titles as well, Harine din Togara Two Winds,
Wavemistress of Clan Shodein, Ambassador Extraordinary of the
Mistress of the Ships to the Atha&rsquo;an Miere. The fellow
blinked, then bit his tongue and bent his neck over the writing
board. Harine scowled. When she wanted to impress someone, she
expected them to be impressed.</p>

<p>As the bony man was writing, a stocky, helmeted
soldier with a leather scrip hanging from his shoulder pushed
between Harine&rsquo;s horse and Moad&rsquo;s. Behind the bars of his
faceguard, a puckered scar down his face pulled up one side of his
mouth in a sneer, but he bowed his head to Harine respectfully
enough. And then he tried to take Moad&rsquo;s sword.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must allow it or leave your blades here until
you depart,&rdquo; Sarene said quickly when the Swordmaster twitched the
scabbard out of the stocky man&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;This service, it is
what Cadsuane was paying for, Wavemistress. In Far Madding, no man
is allowed to carry more than the belt knife unless it is
peace-bonded so it cannot be drawn. Even the Wall Guards like these
men cannot take a sword away from their place of duty. Is that not
so?&rdquo; she asked the skinny soldier, and he replied that it was, and
a good thing, too.</p>

<p>With a shrug, Moad lifted the sword from his sash,
and when the fellow with the perpetual sneer demanded his
ivory-hilted dagger as well, he handed that over. Tucking the long
dagger behind his belt, the man produced a spool of fine wire from
his scrip and deftly began wrapping the sword in a fine net. Every
so often he paused to pluck a seal-press from his belt and fold a
small lead disc around the wires, but he had quick, practiced
hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The list of names, it will be distributed to the
other two bridges,&rdquo; Sarene went on, &ldquo;and the men will have to show
the wires unbroken or they will be held until a magistrate
determines that no other crime has been committed. Even if none
has, the penalty is both a very heavy fine and flogging. Most
foreigners, they deposit their weapons before entering to save the
coin, but that would mean we must leave by this bridge. The Light
alone knows which direction we will want to go when we leave here.&rdquo;
Looking toward Cadsuane, who appeared to be restraining Alanna from
riding across the long bridge alone, Sarene added almost under her
breath, &ldquo;At least, I hope that is her reasoning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harine snorted. &ldquo;This is ridiculous. How is he to
defend himself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No need for any man to defend himself in Far
Madding, Mistress.&rdquo; The stocky man&rsquo;s voice was coarse, but he
did not sound mocking. He was stating the obvious. &ldquo;The Street
Guards take care of that. Let any man as wants start carrying a
sword, and soon we&rsquo;d be as bad as everyplace else. I heard
what they&rsquo;re like, Mistress, and we don&rsquo;t want that
here.&rdquo; Bowing to Harine, he strode on down the column followed by
the man with the writing board.</p>

<p>Moad briefly examined his sword and dagger, both
neatly wrapped hilt and scabbard, then eased them back in place,
taking care not to snag his sash on the seals. &ldquo;Swords only become
useful when wits fail,&rdquo; he said. Harine snorted again. Shalon
wondered how that fellow had gained his scar if Far Madding was so
safe.</p>

<p>Sounds of protest rose from the rear, where the other
men were, but they were quickly silenced. By Merise, Shalon would
have wagered. At times, the woman made Cadsuane seem lax. Her
Warders were like the trained guard dogs the Amayar used, ready to
leap at a whistle, and she was not at all hesitant about calling
down the other Aes Sedai&rsquo;s Warders. Soon enough all of the
swords had been peace-bonded, and the packhorses searched for
hidden weapons, and they rode out onto the bridge, hooves ringing
on stone. Shalon tried to take in everything, not so much from
interest as to take her mind off what was missing.</p>

<p>The bridge was flat and as wide as the road behind,
with low stone copings on the side that would stop a wagon from
plunging over but give no shelter to attackers, and it was long,
too, perhaps as much as three-quarters of a mile, and straight as
an arrow. Now and then one of the boats passed beneath, which they
could not have done had they had masts. Tall towers flanked the
city&rsquo;s iron-strapped gates&mdash;the Caemlyn Gate was the
name Sarene gave&mdash;where guards with the golden sword on their
shoulders bowed their heads to the women and cast suspicious eyes
on the men. The street beyond&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trying to be observant was no use. The street was
wide and straight, full of people and carts, lined with stone
buildings two or three stories high, and it all seemed a blur. The
Source was gone! She knew it would come back when she left this
place, and Light, she wanted to leave now. But how long before she
could? The Coramoor might be in this city, and Harine meant to make
herself fast to the Coramoor, perhaps because of who he was,
perhaps because she thought he would help her rise to Mistress of
the Ships. Until Harine left, until Cadsuane freed them from the
agreement, Shalon was anchored here. Here, where there was no True
Source.</p>

<p>Sarene talked incessantly, yet Shalon barely heard
her. They crossed a large square with a huge statue of a woman in
the center, but Shalon caught only her name, Einion Avharin, though
she knew Sarene was telling her why the woman was famous in Far
Madding and why her statue was pointing toward the Caemlyn Gate. A
row of leafless trees divided the street beyond the square. Sedan
chairs and coaches and men in square-scaled armor threaded though
the crowds, but they registered only on her eyes. Trembling, she
huddled in on herself. The city vanished. Time vanished. Everything
vanished except her fear that she would never feel the Source
again. She had never before realized what comfort she had taken in
its unseen presence. It had always been there, promising joy beyond
knowing, life so rich that colors paled when the Power was gone
from her. And now the Source itself was gone. Gone. That was all
she was aware of, all she could be aware of. It was gone.</p>
