<h4><em>Questions of Treason</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">C</span>limbing
to the cramped kennels at the very top of
the Tarasin Palace, Bethamin held her writing board carefully.
Sometimes the ink jar&rsquo;s cork came loose, and ink spots were
difficult to remove from clothing. She kept herself as presentable
at all times as if she had been called to appear before one of the
High Blood. She did not talk to Renna, who had the inspection duty
with her today, as they walked up the stairs. They were supposed to
be doing an assigned task, not chattering idly. That was part of
her reason. Where others jockeyed to be complete with their
favorite <em>damane</em>, and goggled at the strange sights of this
land, and speculated on the rewards to be gained here, she focused
on her duties, asking for the most difficult <em>
marath&rsquo;damane</em> to tame to the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>, working
twice as hard and twice as long as anyone else.</p>

<p>The rain had stopped, finally, leaving the kennels in
silence. The <em>damane</em> would get some exercise at least,
today&mdash;most grew sulky if confined to the kennels too long,
and these makeshift kennels were decidedly confining&mdash;but
regrettably, she was not assigned to walking today. Renna never
was, though once she had been Suroth&rsquo;s best trainer, and well
respected. A little harsh, sometimes, but highly skilled. Once,
everyone had said she would soon be made <em>
der&rsquo;sul&rsquo;dam</em> in spite of her youth. Matters had
changed. There were always more <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> than <em>
damane</em>, yet no one could recall Renna being complete since
Falme, her or Seta, whom Suroth had taken into personal service
after Falme. Bethamin enjoyed gossiping over wine about the Blood
and those who served them as much as anyone else, yet she never
ventured any opinion when the talk turned to Renna and Seta. She
thought of them often, though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You start on the other side, Renna,&rdquo; she ordered.
&ldquo;Well? Do you want to be reported to Essonde for laziness yet
again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before Falme, the shorter woman had been nearly
overpowering in her self-assurance, but a muscle twitched in her
pale cheek, and she gave Bethamin a sickly, obsequious smile before
hurrying into the kennel&rsquo;s warren of narrow passages patting
at her long hair as though afraid it might be disordered. Everyone
except Renna&rsquo;s closest friends bullied her at least a little,
repaying her former lofty pride. To do otherwise was to mark
yourself out, something Bethamin avoided except in carefully chosen
ways. Her own secrets were buried as deeply as she could bury them,
and she held silent about the secrets no one knew she was aware of,
but she wanted to fix in everyone&rsquo;s mind that Bethamin Zeami
was the image of the perfect <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>. Absolute
perfection was what she strove for, in herself and in the <em>
damane</em> she trained.</p>

<p>She set about her inspection briskly and efficiently,
checking that the <em>damane</em> had kept themselves and their
individual kennels neat, making a short notation in her neat hand
on the top page pinned to the writing board when one had failed to,
and she did not dawdle, except to give out hard candies to a few
who were doing particularly well in the training. Most of those she
had been complete with greeted her entrance with smiles even as
they knelt. Whether from the Empire or from this side of the ocean,
they knew she was firm yet fair. Others did not smile. For the most
part, the Atha&rsquo;an Miere <em>damane</em> met her with stony
faces as dark as her own, or sullen anger they seemed to believe
they were concealing.</p>

<p>She did not mark their anger down for punishment, as
some would have. They still thought they were resisting, but
unseemly demands for the return of their garish jewelry already
were a thing of the past, and they knelt and spoke properly. A new
name was a useful tool with the most difficult cases, creating a
break with what was done and gone, and they answered to theirs,
however reluctantly. Reluctance would fade, along with scowls, and
eventually they would hardly remember they ever had other names. It
was a familiar pattern, and unfailing as sunrise. Some accepted
immediately, and some went into shock at learning what they were.
Always there were a handful who gave ground grudgingly over months,
while with others, one day it was shrieked protests that a terrible
mistake had been made, that they could never have failed the tests,
and the next day came acceptance and calm. The details differed on
this side of the ocean, but here or in the Empire, the end result
remained the same.</p>

<p>For two of the <em>damane</em> she made notes that
had nothing to do with neatness. Zushi, an Atha&rsquo;an Miere <em>
damane</em> even taller than she herself, was certainly marked for
a switching. Her dress was rumpled, her hair uncombed, her bed
unmade. But her face was swollen from crying, and no sooner had she
knelt than a new set of sobs racked her, tears streaming down her
cheeks. The gray dress that had been fitted on her so carefully now
hung loosely, and she had not been plump to begin with. Bethamin
had named Zushi herself, and she felt a special concern. Unclipping
the steel-nibbed pen, she dipped it and wrote a suggestion that
Zushi be moved from the Palace to somewhere she could be kept in a
double kennel with a <em>damane</em> from the Empire, preferably
one experienced in becoming heart-friends with newly collared <em>
damane</em>. Sooner or later, that always put an end to tears.</p>

<p>She was not sure Suroth would allow it, though.
Suroth had claimed these <em>damane</em> for the Empress, of course&mdash;anyone who owned a tenth so many personally would be
suspected of plotting rebellion, or even accused outright&mdash;yet she behaved as though they were her own property. If Suroth
disallowed, some other way would have to be found. Bethamin refused
to lose a <em>damane</em> to despondency. She refused to lose a
<em>damane</em> for any reason! The second to receive a special
comment was Tessi, and she expected no objections there.</p>

<p>The Illianer <em>damane</em> knelt gracefully, hands
folded at her waist, as soon as Bethamin opened the door. Her bed
was made, her extra gray dresses hung neatly on their pegs, her
brush and comb were laid out precisely on her washstand, and the
floor had been swept. Bethamin expected no less. Tessi had been
neat from the start. She was fleshing out nicely now that she had
learned to clean her plate. Other than treats, <em>
damane</em>&rsquo;s diets were regulated strictly; an unhealthy <em>
damane</em> was a waste. Tessi would never be decked in ribbons and
entered in the competitions for the prettiest <em>damane</em>,
though. Her face seemed perpetually angry even in repose. But today
she wore a slight smile that Bethamin was sure had been in place
before she entered. Tessi was not one she expected smiles from, not
yet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is my little Tessi feeling today?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tessi do feel very well,&rdquo; the <em>damane</em>
replied smoothly. Always before she had had to struggle to speak
properly, and had earned her latest switching for outright refusal
only yesterday.</p>

<p>Fingering her chin thoughtfully, Bethamin studied the
kneeling <em>damane</em>. She was suspicious of any <em>damane</em>
who had called herself Aes Sedai. History fascinated her, and she
had even read translations from the myriad of languages that had
existed before the Consolidation began. Those ancient rulers
reveled in their murderous, capricious rule, and delighted in
setting down how they came to power and how they crushed
neighboring states and undermined other rulers. Most had died by
assassination, often at the hands of their own heirs or followers.
She knew very well what Aes Sedai were like.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tessi is a good <em>damane</em>,&rdquo; she murmured
warmly, taking one of the hard candies from the twist of paper in
her belt pouch. Tessi leaned forward to receive it and kiss her
hand in thanks, but the smile slipped a little, though it was back
by the time she stuffed the red candy into her mouth. So. It was
like that, was it? Pretending to accept in order to lull the <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em> was not unknown, but given what Tessi had been,
very likely she was plotting escape as well.</p>

<p>Back out in the narrow hallway, Bethamin wrote a
strong suggestion that Tessi&rsquo;s training be redoubled, along
with her punishments, and her rewards be made sporadic, so she
could never be sure that even perfection would earn so much as a
pat on the head. It was a harsh method, one she normally avoided,
but for some reason it turned even the most recalcitrant <em>
marath&rsquo;damane</em> into a supple <em>damane</em> in a
remarkably short time. It also produced the meekest of <em>
damane</em>. She disliked breaking a <em>damane</em>&rsquo;s spirit,
yet Tessi needed to be broken to the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> so she
could forget the past. She would be happier for it, in the end.</p>

<p>Finishing ahead of Renna, Bethamin waited at the foot
of the stairs until the other <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> came down.
&ldquo;Take this to Essonde when you take yours,&rdquo; she said, thrusting her
writing board at Renna before she cleared the final step.
Unsurprisingly, Renna accepted the task as meekly as she had
accepted the earlier order, and hurried away eyeing the extra
writing board as though wondering whether the pages held a report
on her. She was a very different woman than she had been before
Falme.</p>

<p>Fetching her cloak and leaving the Palace, Bethamin
intended to return to the inn where she was forced to share a bed
with two other <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>, but only long enough to take
some coin from her lockbox. The inspection had been her only duty
today, and the rest of the hours were her own. For a change,
instead of seeking extra assignments, she would spend them buying
souvenirs. Perhaps one of those knives the local women wore at
their necks, if she could find one without the gems they seemed to
like on the hilt. And lacquerware, of course; that was as good here
as any in the Empire, and the designs were so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;foreign. It
would be soothing to shop. She needed soothing.</p>

<p>The paving stones of the Mol Hara still glistened
damply from the morning&rsquo;s rain, and a pleasant tang of salt
filled the air, reminding her of the village on the Sea of
L&rsquo;Heye where she had been born, though the freezing cold made
her clutch her cloak around herself. It had never been cold in
Abunai, and she had never become accustomed to it no matter how far
she had traveled. Thoughts of home were no comfort, now, though. As
she made her way through the crowded streets, Renna and Seta filled
her head to the extent that she bumped into people and once almost
walked right in front of a merchant&rsquo;s train of wagons leaving
the city. A shout from a wagon driver caught her attention, and she
leaped back just in time. The wagon rumbled across the paving
stones where she would have been standing, and the woman wielding
the whip did not even glance at her. These foreigners had no idea
of the respect due a <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>.</p>

<p>Renna and Seta. Everyone who had been at Falme had
memories they wanted to forget, memories they would not talk about
except when they drank too much. She did, too, only hers were not
about the shock of battling half-recognized ghosts out of legend,
or the horror of defeat, or mad visions in the sky. How often had
she wished she had not gone upstairs that day? If only she had not
wondered how Tuli was doing, the <em>damane</em> who had the
marvelous skill with metals. But she had looked into Tuli&rsquo;s
kennel. And she had seen Renna and Seta frantically trying to
remove <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> from each other&rsquo;s necks, shrieking
with the pain, wavering on their knees from the nausea, and still
fumbling at the collars. Vomit stained the fronts of their dresses.
In their frenzy they had not noticed her backing away,
horror-stricken.</p>

<p>Not simply horror at seeing two <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>
revealed as <em>marath&rsquo;damane</em>, but her own sudden
personal terror. Often she thought she could almost see <em>
damane</em>&rsquo;s weaves, and she could always sense a <em>
damane</em>&rsquo;s presence and know how strong she was. Many <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em> could; everyone knew it came from long experience
at handling the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>. Yet the sight of that
desperate pair roused unwanted thoughts, putting a different and
frightening complexion on what she had always accepted. Did she
<em>almost</em> see the weaves, or did she really see? Sometimes
she thought she <em>felt</em> the channeling, too. Even <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em> had to undergo the yearly testing, until their
twenty-fifth naming day, and she had passed by failing every time.
Only&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;There would be a new testing after Renna and Seta were
discovered, a new testing to find the <em>marath&rsquo;damane</em>
who somehow had evaded the first. The Empire itself might tremble
before such a blow. And with the image of Renna and Seta burned
into her brain, she had known with total certainty that after those
tests, Bethamin Zeami would no longer be a respected citizen.
Instead, a <em>damane</em> called Bethamin would serve the
Empire.</p>

<p>The shame curdled in her still. She had placed
personal fears ahead of the needs of the Empire, ahead of
everything she knew to be right and true and good. Battle came to
Falme, and nightmare, but she had not rushed to complete herself
with a <em>damane</em> and join the battle line. Instead, she had
used the confusion to secure a horse and flee, to run as hard and
as far as she could.</p>

<p>She realized she had stopped, staring into a
seamstress&rsquo;s shop window without really seeing what was on
display inside. Not that she wanted to see. The blue dress with its
lightning-marked red panels was the only one she had thought of
wearing in years. And she certainly would not wear something that
exposed her so indecently. Skirts swirling about her ankles, she
walked on, but she could not shake Renna and Seta from her
thoughts, or Suroth.</p>

<p>Obviously Alwhin had found the collared pair of <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em> and reported them to Suroth. And Suroth had
sheltered the Empire by protecting Renna and Seta, dangerous as
that was. What if they suddenly began channeling? Better perhaps
for the Empire if she had arranged their deaths, though killing a
<em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> was murder even for the High Blood. Two
suspicious deaths among the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> would certainly
have brought in Seekers. So Renna and Seta were free, if it could
be called that when they were never allowed to be complete. Alwhin
had done her duty, and been honored by becoming Suroth&rsquo;s
Voice. Suroth had done her duty as well, however distasteful. There
was no new testing. Her own flight had been for nothing. And if she
had remained, she would not have ended up in Tanchico, a nightmare
she wanted to forget even more than she did Falme.</p>

<p>A squad of the Deathwatch Guards marched by,
resplendent in their armor, and Bethamin paused to watch them pass.
They left a wake through the crowd like a greatship under full
sail. There would be joy in the city, in the land, when Tuon
finally revealed herself, and celebrations as though she had just
arrived. She felt a guilty pleasure at thinking of the Daughter of
the Nine Moons so, as when she had done something forbidden as a
child, though of course, until Tuon removed her veil, she was
merely the High Lady Tuon, no higher than Suroth. The Deathwatch
Guards tramped on, dedicated heart and soul to Empress and Empire,
and Bethamin went in the opposite direction. Appropriately, since
she was dedicated heart and soul to preserving her own freedom.</p>

<p>The Golden Swans of Heaven was a grand name for a
tiny inn squeezed between a public stable and a lacquerware shop.
The lacquerware shop was full of military officers buying
everything the shop contained, the stable was full of horses
purchased in the lottery and not yet assigned, and The Golden Swans
was full of <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>. Packed with them, in fact, at
least once night came. Bethamin was lucky to have only two
bedmates. Ordered to accommodate as many as she could, the
innkeeper pushed four and five into a bed when she thought they
would fit. Still, the bedding was clean and the food quite good, if
peculiar. And given that the alternative was likely a hayloft, she
was glad to share.</p>

<p>At this hour, the round tables in the common room
were empty. Some of the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> living there surely
had duties, and the rest simply wanted to avoid the innkeeper. Arms
folded, frowning, Darnella Shoran was watching several serving
women sweep the green-tiled floor industriously. A skinny woman
with gray hair worn rolled on the nape of her neck and a long jaw
that gave her a belligerent appearance, she might have been a <em>
der&rsquo;sul&rsquo;dam</em> in spite of the ridiculous knife she
wore, its hilt studded with cheap red and white gems. Supposedly
the serving women were free, but they jumped like property whenever
the innkeeper spoke.</p>

<p>Bethamin jumped slightly herself when the woman
rounded on her. &ldquo;You are aware of my rules concerning men, Mistress
Zeami?&rdquo; she demanded. After all this time, the slow way these
people talked still sounded odd. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard about your
foreign ways, and if that is how you are, it is your business, but
not under my roof. If you want to meet with men, you will do it
elsewhere!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I assure you, I have not been meeting men here or
anywhere else, Mistress Shoran.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The innkeeper frowned at her in suspicion. &ldquo;Well, he
came around asking for you by name. A pretty, yellow-haired man.
Not a boy, but not very old, either. One of your lot, dragging his
words out so you could hardly understand him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Making her tone placating, Bethamin did her best to
convince the woman that she did not know anyone who met that
description, and that she had no time for men with her duties. Both
were true, yet she would have lied if necessary. The Golden Swans
had not been commandeered, and three in a bed was <em>much</em>
preferable to a hayloft. She tried to find out whether the woman
might like some small gift when she went shopping, but the woman
actually seemed offended when she suggested a knife with more
colorful gems. She had not meant anything expensive, nothing in way
of a bribe&mdash;not really&mdash;yet Mistress Shoran seemed to
take it so, huffing and frowning indignantly. In any case, she was
not sure she succeeded in changing the woman&rsquo;s mind by a hair.
For some reason, the innkeeper seemed to believe they spent all
their free hours engaged in debauchery. She was still frowning when
Bethamin started up the railless stairs at the side of the common
room pretending that she had not a thought in her mind beyond
shopping.</p>

<p>The man&rsquo;s identity did concern her, though. She
certainly did not recognize the description. In all likelihood, he
had come about her inquiries, but if that was the case, if he had
been able to trace her here, then she had been insufficiently
discreet. Perhaps dangerously so. Still, she hoped he came back.
She needed to know. She needed to!</p>

<p>Opening the door to her room, she froze. Impossibly,
her iron lockbox sat on the bed with its lid thrown open. That was
a very good lock, and the only key lay at the bottom of her belt
pouch. The thief was still there, and oddly, he was thumbing
through her diary! How in the Light had the man gotten past
Mistress Shoran&rsquo;s surveillance?</p>

<p>Paralysis lasted only an instant. Snatching her belt
knife from its sheath, she opened her mouth to scream for help.</p>

<p>The fellow&rsquo;s expression never changed, and he
neither tried to run nor to attack her. He just took something
small from his pouch and held it up where she could see it, and her
breath turned to lead in her throat. Numbly she fumbled her knife
back into its scabbard and held out her hands to show him she held
no weapon and was not attempting to reach one. Between his fingers
was a gold-edged ivory plaque, engraved with a raven and a tower.
Suddenly she really saw the man, yellow-haired and in his middle
years. Perhaps he was pretty, as Mistress Shoran had said, but only
a madwoman would think of a Seeker for Truth in that fashion. Thank
the Light she had not recorded anything dangerous in her diary. But
he must know. He had asked for her by name. Oh, Light, he must
know!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Close the door,&rdquo; he said quietly, returning the
plaque to his pouch, and she obeyed. She wanted to run. She wanted
to plead for mercy. But he was a Seeker, so she stood there,
trembling. To her surprise, he dropped her diary back into the
lockbox and gestured to the room&rsquo;s single chair. &ldquo;Sit. There
is no need for you to be uncomfortable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slowly, she hung up her cloak and settled onto the
chair, for once not caring how uncomfortable the strange ladderlike
back was. She did not try to hide her shivers. Even one of the
Blood, even one of the High Blood, might quake at being questioned
by a Seeker. She had a small hope. He had not simply ordered her to
accompany him. Perhaps he did not know after all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been asking questions about a ship captain
named Egeanin Sarna,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hope faltered with a thud she could feel in her
chest. &ldquo;I was looking for an old friend,&rdquo; she quavered. The best
lies always contained as much truth as possible. &ldquo;We were at Falme
together. I don&rsquo;t know whether she survived.&rdquo; Lying to a
Seeker was treason, but she had committed her first treason in
deserting during the battle at Falme.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She lives,&rdquo; he said curtly. He sat down on the end
of the bed without taking his eyes from her. They were blue, and
made her want her cloak back. &ldquo;She is a hero, a Captain of the
Green, and the Lady Egeanin Tamarath, now. Her reward from the High
Lady Suroth. She is also here in Ebou Dar. You will renew your
friendship with her. And report to me who she sees, where she goes,
what she says. Everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bethamin clamped her jaws to keep from laughing
hysterically. He was after Egeanin, not her. The Light be praised!
The Light be praised in all its infinite mercy! She had only wanted
to know if the woman still lived, if she had to take precautions.
Egeanin had freed her once, yet in the ten years Bethamin had known
her before that, she had been a model of duty. It had always seemed
possible she would repent that one aberration no matter the cost to
herself, but, wonder of wonders, she had not. And the Seeker was
after her, not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;! Possibilities reared up in front of her,
certainties, and she no longer wanted to laugh. Instead, she licked
her lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? How can I renew our friendship?&rdquo; It had
never been friendship anyway, merely acquaintance, but it was too
late to say that now. &ldquo;You tell me she&rsquo;s been raised to the
Blood. Any overture must come from her.&rdquo; Fear emboldened her. And
panicked her as it had at Falme. &ldquo;Why do you need me to be your
Listener? You can take her for questioning any time you decide to.&rdquo;
She bit the inside of her cheek to still her tongue. Light, she
wanted nothing less than she wanted him to do that. Seekers were
the secret hand of the Empress, might she live forever; in the
Empress&rsquo;s name, he could put even Suroth to the question, or
Tuon herself. True, he would die horribly if it turned out he had
been in error, but the risk was small with Egeanin. She was only of
the low Blood. If he put Egeanin to the question&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To her shock, rather than simply telling her to obey,
he sat studying her. &ldquo;I will explain certain things,&rdquo; he said, and
that was a greater shock. Seekers never explained, so she had
heard. &ldquo;You are no use to me, or the Empire, unless you survive,
and you will not survive if you fail to understand what you face.
If you reveal a word of what I tell you to anyone, you will dream
of the Tower of the Ravens as a respite from where you will find
yourself. Listen, and learn. Egeanin was sent to Tanchico before
the city fell to us, among other things as part of the effort to
find <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> who had been left behind at Falme.
Strangely, she found none, though others did, like those who aided
your own return. Instead, Egeanin murdered the <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em> she found. I put the charge to her my self, and
she did not bother denying it. She did not even show outrage, or
even indignation. As bad, she consorted in secret with Aes Sedai.&rdquo;
He said the name flatly, not with the normal disgust but rather
like an accusation. &ldquo;When she departed Tanchico, she was traveling
on a ship commanded by a man named Bayle Domon. He made some
disturbance at having his ship boarded and was made property. She
bought him and immediately made him <em>so&rsquo;jhin</em>, so
plainly he is of some importance to her. Interestingly, she had
brought the same man to the High Lord Turak in Falme. Domon engaged
the High Lord&rsquo;s regard to the extent that the fellow was often
invited to converse with him.&rdquo; He grimaced. &ldquo;Do you have wine? Or
brandy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bethamin gave a start. &ldquo;Lona has a flask of the local
brandy, I think. It&rsquo;s a rough drink&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He ordered her to pour him a cup anyway, and she
obeyed hurriedly. She wanted to keep him talking, anything to delay
the inevitable. She knew for a fact that Egeanin had not been
killing <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>, yet her proof would condemn her to
share Renna and Seta&rsquo;s sour fate. If she was lucky. If this
Seeker saw his duty to the Empire as Suroth had. He peered into the
pewter cup, swirling the dark apple brandy while she took her seat
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The High Lord Turak was a great man,&rdquo; he murmured.
&ldquo;Perhaps one of the greatest the Empire has ever seen. A pity his
<em>so&rsquo;jhin</em> decided to follow him into death. Honorable
of them, but it makes it impossible to be sure Domon was in the
band that murdered the High Lord.&rdquo; Bethamin flinched. Sometimes the
Blood died at one another&rsquo;s hands, of course, but the word
murder was never mentioned. The Seeker continued, still peering
into his cup without drinking. &ldquo;The High Lord had ordered me to
watch Suroth. He suspected she was a danger to the Empire itself.
His own words. And with his death, she managed to gain command of
the Forerunners. I have no evidence that she ordered his death, but
there is much that is suggestive. Suroth brought a <em>damane</em>
to Falme, a young woman who was Aes Sedai,&rdquo; again, the name was
flat and hard, &ldquo;and who somehow escaped the very day that Turak
died. Suroth also has a <em>damane</em> in her entourage who was
once Aes Sedai. She has never been seen uncollared, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He
shrugged, as though that were a thing of no moment. Bethamin&rsquo;s
eyes popped. Who would uncollar a <em>damane</em>? A well-trained
<em>damane</em> was a treat and a joy, but as well unleash a
drunken <em>grolm</em>! &ldquo;It seems very likely she has a <em>
marath&rsquo;damane</em> hidden among her property, too,&rdquo; he went
on, just as if he were not listing crimes little lower than
treason. &ldquo;I believe Suroth gave the order for <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>
who managed to reach Tanchico to be killed, perhaps in order to
hide Egeanin&rsquo;s meetings with Aes Sedai. You <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em> always say you can tell a <em>
marath&rsquo;damane</em> at sight, correct?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked up suddenly, and somehow she managed to
meet those frozen eyes with a smile. His face could have belonged
to any man, but those eyes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She was glad to be seated. Her
knees were shaking so hard she was surprised it did not show
through her skins. &ldquo;It is not quite that easy, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;
She almost succeeded in keeping her voice steady. &ldquo;You&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Surely
you know enough to charge Suroth with the High Lord Turak&rsquo;s
m-m-murder.&rdquo; If he took Suroth, there would be no need to involve
her, or Egeanin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Turak was a great man, but my duty is to the
Empress, may she live forever, and through her, to the Empire.&rdquo; He
drank the brandy down in one long swallow, and his face became as
hard as his voice. &ldquo;Turak&rsquo;s death is dust beside the danger
facing the Empire. The Aes Sedai of these lands seek power in the
Empire, a return to the days of chaos and murder when no man could
close his eyes at night knowing he would wake, and they are aided
by a venomous worm of treachery boring from within. Suroth may not
even be that worm&rsquo;s head. For the Empire&rsquo;s sake, I dare
not take her until I can kill the whole worm. Egeanin is a thread I
can follow to the worm, and you are a thread to Egeanin. So you
will renew your friendship with her, whatever it takes. Do you
understand me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand, and I will obey.&rdquo; Her voice shook, but
what else could she say? The Light save her, what else could she
say?</p>
