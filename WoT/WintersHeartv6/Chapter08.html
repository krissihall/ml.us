<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t
was no surprise to Elayne when she encountered the
First Maid before reaching her apartments. After all, they were
both heading for the same place. Mistress Harfor made her curtsy
and fell in with her, carrying an embossed leather folder beneath
one arm. She had certainly been up as early as Elayne if not
earlier, but her scarlet tabard appeared freshly ironed, the White
Lion on her front as clean and pale as new-fallen snow. The
servants scurried faster and polished harder when they saw her.
Reene Harfor was not harsh, but she kept as tight a discipline over
the Palace as Gareth Bryne ever had over the Guards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear I haven&rsquo;t caught any spies yet, my
Lady,&rdquo; she said in response to Elayne&rsquo;s question, her voice
pitched to reach Elayne&rsquo;s ears alone, &ldquo;but I believe I
uncovered a pair. A woman and a man, both taken in service during
the last months of the late Queen your mother&rsquo;s reign. They
left the Palace as soon as word spread that I was questioning
everyone. Without waiting to gather a scrap of their belongings,
not so much as a cloak. That&rsquo;s as good as an admission,
I&rsquo;d say. Unless they were afraid of being caught out in some
other mischief,&rdquo; she added reluctantly. &ldquo;There have been cases of
pilfering, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne nodded thoughtfully. Naean and Elenia had been
much in the Palace during the last months of her mother&rsquo;s
reign. More than enough opportunity to settle eyes-and-ears in
place. Those two had been in the Palace, and more who had opposed
Morgase Trakand&rsquo;s claim to the throne, accepted her amnesty
once she had it, then betrayed her. She would not make her
mother&rsquo;s mistake. Oh, there must be amnesty wherever possible&mdash;anything else was planting the seeds for a civil war&mdash;but she planned to watch those who took her pardon very closely.
Like a cat watching a rat that claimed to have given up interest in
the grain barns. &ldquo;They were spies,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And there may well
be others. Not just for Houses. The sisters at the Silver Swan may
have bought eyes-and-ears in the Palace, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will continue to look, my Lady,&rdquo; Reene replied,
inclining her head slightly. Her tone was perfectly respectful; she
did not so much as raise an eyebrow, but once again Elayne found
herself thinking of teaching her grandmother to knit. If only
Birgitte could handle matters the way Mistress Harfor did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As well you returned early,&rdquo; the plump woman went
on. &ldquo;You have a busy afternoon, I fear. To begin, Master Norry
wishes to speak with you. On an urgent matter, he says.&rdquo; Her mouth
hardened for an instant. She always required to know why people
wanted to approach Elayne, so she could winnow out the chaff rather
than let Elayne be buried under it, but the First Clerk never saw
fit to give her even a hint of his business. Any more than she told
him hers. Both were jealous of their fiefs. With a shake of her
head, she dismissed Halwin Norry. &ldquo;After him, a delegation of tabac
merchants has petitioned to see you, and another of weavers, both
asking remission of taxes because times are hard. My Lady does not
need my advice to tell them times are hard for everyone. A group of
foreign merchants is waiting as well; rather a large group. Merely
to wish you well in a way that doesn&rsquo;t encumber them, of
course&mdash;they wish to be on your good side without
antagonizing anyone else&mdash;but I suggest meeting them
briefly.&rdquo; She laid plump fingers on the folder under her arm.
&ldquo;Also, the Palace accounts require your signature before they can
go to Master Norry. They&rsquo;ll make him sigh, I fear. I hardly
expected it in winter, but much of the flour is full of weevils and
moths, and half the cured hams have turned, as well as most of the
smoked fish.&rdquo; Quite respectful. And quite firm.</p>

<p><em>I rule Andor</em>, Elayne&rsquo;s mother had told
her once, in private, <em>but at times I think Reene Harfor rules
me</em>. Her mother had been laughing, but she sounded as if she
meant it, too. Come to think on it, Mistress Harfor as a Warder
would be ten times worse than Birgitte.</p>

<p>Elayne did not want to meet with Halwin Norry or with
merchants. She wanted to sit quietly and think about spies, and who
had Naean and Elenia, and how she could counter them. Except&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Master Norry had kept Caemlyn alive since her mother died. In
truth, by what she could see in the old accounts, he had done so
almost from the day she had fallen into Rahvin&rsquo;s clutches,
though Norry was vague about that. He seemed offended by the events
of those days, in a rather dusty way. She could not simply shuffle
him off. Besides, he never expressed urgency over anything. And the
goodwill of merchants was not to be sneered at, even foreign
merchants. And the accounts did need to be signed. Weevils and
moths? And hams spoiling? In winter? That was decidedly odd.</p>

<p>They had reached the tall, lion-carved doors of her
apartments. Smaller lions than on the doors to those her mother had
used, and smaller apartments, but she never considered using the
Queen&rsquo;s chambers. That would have been as presumptuous as
sitting on the Lion Throne before her right to the Rose Crown was
acknowledged.</p>

<p>With a sigh, she reached for the folder.</p>

<p>Down the hallway she caught sight of Solain
Morgeillin and Keraille Surtovni, hurrying along as quickly as they
could without appearing to run. Flashes of silver showed at the
neck of the sullen woman squeezed between them, though the
Kinswomen had draped a long green scarf around her to hide the <em>
a&rsquo;dam</em>&rsquo;s leash. That <em>would</em> cause talk, and
it would be seen sooner or later. Better if she and the others did
not have to be moved, but there was no way to avoid it. Between
Kinswomen and Sea Folk Windfinders, rooms in the servants&rsquo;
quarters had been needed to hold the overflow even with two and
three to a bed, and the Palace had basements for storage, not
dungeons. How did Rand <em>always</em> manage to do the wrong
thing? Being male just was not excuse enough. Solain and Keraille
vanished around a corner with their prisoner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mistress Corly asked to see you this morning, my
Lady.&rdquo; Reene&rsquo;s voice was carefully neutral. She had been
watching the Kinswomen, too, and a trace of frown remained on her
broad face. The Sea Folk were odd, yet she could fit a clan
Wavemistress and her entourage into her view of the world even if
she did not know precisely what a clan Wavemistress was. A
high-ranking foreigner was a high-ranking foreigner, and foreigners
were expected to be odd. But she could not understand why Elayne
had given shelter to nearly a hundred and fifty merchants and
craftswomen. Neither &ldquo;the Kin&rdquo; nor &ldquo;the Knitting Circle&rdquo; would
have meant anything to her had she heard them, and she did not
understand the peculiar tensions between those women and the Aes
Sedai. Nor did she understand the women the Asha&rsquo;man had
brought, prisoners in truth if not confined in cells, kept secluded
and never allowed to speak to anyone but the women who escorted
them through the halls. The First Maid knew when not to ask
questions, yet she disliked not understanding what was going on in
the Palace. Her voice did not change by a hair. &ldquo;She said she had
good news for you. Of a sort, she said. She did not petition for an
audience, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Good news of any sort was better than going over the
accounts, and she had hopes of what this news might be.
Relinquishing the folder in the First Maid&rsquo;s hands, she said,
&ldquo;Leave that on my writing table, please. And tell Master Norry that
I will see him shortly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Setting out in the direction the Kin had come from
with their prisoner, she walked quickly in spite of her skirts.
Good news or no good news, Norry and the merchants did have to be
seen, and the merchants, not to mention the accounts gone over and
signed. Ruling meant endless weeks of drudgery and rare hours of
doing what you wanted. Very rare hours. Birgitte lay in the back of
her head, a tight ball of the purest irritation and frustration. No
doubt, she was digging through that table piled with papers. Well,
her own relaxation this day would be whatever time was required to
change out of riding clothes and snatch a hasty meal. So she walked
very quickly, lost in thought and hardly seeing what was in front
other. What did Norry find urgent? Surely not street repairs. How
many spies? Small chance Mistress Harfor would catch them all.</p>

<p>As she rounded a corner, only the sudden awareness of
other women who could channel kept her from running headlong into
Vandene coming the other way. They recoiled from one another in
startlement. Apparently the Green had been deep in thought, too.
Her two companions raised Elayne&rsquo;s eyebrows.</p>

<p>Kirstian and Zarya wore plain white and stayed a
careful pace behind Vandene, hands folded meekly at their waists.
Their hair was bound back simply, and they wore no jewelry. Jewelry
was strongly discouraged among novices. They had been Kinswomen&mdash;Kirstian had actually been in the Knitting Circle it self&mdash;but they were runaways from the Tower, and there were
prescribed ways of dealing with those, set in Tower law, no matter
how long they had been gone. Returned runaways were required to be
absolutely perfect in everything they did, the very model of an
initiate striving for the shawl, and small slips that might be
overlooked in others were punished swiftly and strongly. They faced
a much stronger punishment when they reached the Tower, in
addition, a public birching, and even then they would be held to
their straight and painful path for at least a year. A returned
runaway was made to know in her heart that she never, ever wanted
to run away again. Not ever! Half-trained women were just too
dangerous to be left loose.</p>

<p>Elayne had tried to be lenient, the few times she was
with them&mdash;the Kinswomen were not really half-trained; they
had as much experience with the One Power as any Aes Sedai, if not
the training&mdash;she had tried, only to discover that even most
of the other Kinswomen disapproved. Given another chance to become
Aes Sedai&mdash;those who could, at least&mdash;they embraced all
of the Tower&rsquo;s laws and customs with shocking fervor. She was
not surprised at the subdued eagerness in the two women&rsquo;s eyes
or the way they seemed to radiate a promise of good behavior&mdash;they wanted that chance as badly as anyone&mdash;just that they
were with Vandene at all. Until now, she had ignored the pair
entirely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was looking for you, Elayne,&rdquo; Vandene said without
preamble. Her white hair, gathered at the nape of neck with a dark
green ribbon, had always given her an air of age despite her smooth
cheeks. Her sister&rsquo;s murder had added grimness, soaked it into
the bone, so she seemed like an implacable judge. She had been
slender; now she was bony, her cheeks hollow. &ldquo;These children&mdash;&rdquo; She cut off, a faint grimace thinning her mouth.</p>

<p>It was the proper way to refer to novices&mdash;the
worst moment for a woman who went to the Tower was not when she
discovered she would not be considered fully adult until she earned
the shawl, but when she realized that so long as she wore novice
white, she really was a child, one who might injure herself or
others through ignorance and blundering&mdash;the proper way, yet
even to Vandene it must have seemed strange here. Most novices came
to the Tower at fifteen or sixteen, and until recently, none over
eighteen, except for a handful who had managed to carry off a lie.
Unlike Aes Sedai, the Kin used age to set their hierarchy, and
Zarya&mdash;she had been calling herself Garenia Rosoinde, but
Zarya Alkaese was the name in the novice books, and Zarya Alkaese
she would answer to&mdash;Zarya, with her strong nose and wide
mouth, was more than ninety years old, though she appeared well
short of her middle years. Neither woman had the agelessness
despite their years of using the Power, and pretty, black-eyed
Kirstian looked a little older, perhaps thirty or so. She was over
three hundred, older than Vandene herself, Elayne was sure.
Kirstian had been gone from the Tower so long that she had felt
safe using her true name again, or part of it. Not at all the usual
run of novices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These <em>children</em>,&rdquo; Vandene went on more
firmly, a deep frown creasing her forehead, &ldquo;have been thinking
over events in Harlon Bridge.&rdquo; That was where her sister had been
murdered. And Ispan Shefar, but as far as Vandene was concerned,
the death of a Black sister counted with the death of a rabid dog.
&ldquo;Unfortunately, rather than keeping silent about their conclusions,
they came to me. At least they haven&rsquo;t blathered where anyone
could hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne frowned slightly. Everyone in the Palace knew
of the murders by this time. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; she said
slowly. And carefully. She did not want to give the pair hints if
they had not really dug up painstakingly hidden secrets. &ldquo;Have they
worked out that it was Darkfriends instead of robbery?&rdquo; That was
the tale they had put about, two women in an isolated house, killed
for their jewelry. Only she, Vandene, Nynaeve and Lan knew any real
measure of the truth. Until now anyway, it seemed. They must have
gotten that far, or Vandene would have sent them away with a flea
in their collective ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Worse.&rdquo; Vandene looked around, then moved a few
paces to the center of where the hallways crossed, forcing Elayne
to follow. From that vantage, they could see anyone coming along
either corridor. The novices attentively maintained their positions
relative to the Green. Maybe they had already gotten that flea, for
all their eagerness. There were plenty of servants in sight, but no
one approaching, no one close enough to overhear. Vandene lowered
her voice anyway. Quietness did nothing to mask her displeasure.
&ldquo;They reasoned out that the killer must be Merilille, Sareitha or
Careane. Good thinking on their part, I suppose, but they
shouldn&rsquo;t have been thinking about it in the first place. They
should have been kept at their lessons so hard they had no time to
think of anything else.&rdquo; Despite the scowl she directed at Kirstian
and Zarya, the two overaged novices beamed with delight. There had
been a compliment buried in the scolding, and Vandene was sparing
of compliments.</p>

<p>Elayne did not point out that the pair might have
been kept a little busier if Vandene had been willing to take part
of their lessons. Elayne herself and Nynaeve had too many other
duties, and since they had added daily lessons for the Windfinders&mdash;everyone but Nynaeve had, anyway&mdash;no one at all had
the energy for much time with the two novices. Teaching the
Atha&rsquo;an Miere women was like being fed through a
laundress&rsquo;s mangle! They had little respect for Aes Sedai. And
even less for rank among &ldquo;the shorebound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least they didn&rsquo;t speak to anyone else,&rdquo; she
murmured. A blessing, if small.</p>

<p>It had been obvious when they found Adeleas and Ispan
that their killer must be an Aes Sedai. They had been paralyzed
with crimsonthorn before they were killed, and it was all but
impossible that the Windfinders knew of an herb only found far from
the sea. And even Vandene was sure the Kin numbered no Darkfriends
among them. Ispan had run away herself as a novice, and even gotten
as far as Ebou Dar, but she had been retaken before the Kin
revealed themselves to her, that they were more than a few women
put out of the Tower who had decided on a whim to help her. Under
questioning by Vandene and Adeleas, she had revealed a great deal.
Somehow she had managed to resist saying anything about the Black
Ajah itself except for exposing old schemes long carried out, but
she had been eager to tell anything else once Vandene and her
sister were done with her. They had not been gentle, and they had
plumbed her depths, yet she knew no more of the Kin than any other
Aes Sedai. If there were any Darkfriends among the Kin, the Black
Ajah would have known everything. So as much as they could wish
otherwise, the killer was one of three women they had all grown to
like. A Black sister in their midst. Or more than one. They had all
been frantic to keep that knowledge secret, at least until the
murderer was uncovered. The news would throw the entire Palace into
a panic, maybe the entire city. Light, who else had been thinking
over events in Harlon Bridge? Would they have the sense to hold
silence?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Someone had to take them in hand,&rdquo; Vandene said
firmly, &ldquo;to keep them out of further mischief. They need regular
lessons and hard work.&rdquo; The pair&rsquo;s beaming faces had taken on
a hint of smugness, but it faded a little at that. Their lessons
had been few, but <em>very</em> hard, the discipline <em>very</em>
strict. &ldquo;That means you, Elayne, or Nynaeve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne clicked her tongue in exasperation. &ldquo;Vandene,
I hardly have a moment for myself to think. I&rsquo;m already
straining to give them an hour now and then. It will have to be
Nynaeve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will have to be Nynaeve?&rdquo; the woman herself
demanded cheerfully, joining them. Somehow she had acquired a long,
yellow-fringed shawl embroidered with leaves and bright flowers,
but it lay looped over her elbows. Despite the temperatures she
wore a blue gown with quite a low neckline for Andor, though the
thick, dark braid pulled over her shoulder and nestled in her
cleavage kept the exposure from being too great. The small red dot,
the <em>ki&rsquo;sain</em>, in the middle of her forehead did look
quite strange. According to Malkieri custom, a red <em>
ki&rsquo;sain</em> marked a married woman, and she had insisted on
wearing it as soon as she learned. Toying idly with the end of her
braid, she looked&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;content&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;not an emotion anyone usually
associated with Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara.</p>

<p>Elayne gave a start when she noticed Lan, a few paces
off, strolling a circle around them and keeping watch down both
hallways. As tall as an Aielman in his dark green coat, with
shoulders belonging on a blacksmith, the hard-faced man still
managed to move like a ghost. His sword was buckled at his waist
even here in the Palace. He always made Elayne shiver. Death gazed
from his cold blue eyes. Except when he looked at Nynaeve,
anyway.</p>

<p>Contentment vanished from Nynaeve&rsquo;s face as soon
as she learned what would have to be her task. She stopped
fingering her braid, and seized it in a tight fist. &ldquo;Now you listen
to me. Elayne might be able to loll around playing politics, but I
have my hands full. More than half the Kin would have vanished by
now if Alise wasn&rsquo;t holding them by the scruff of the neck,
and since she hasn&rsquo;t a hope of reaching the shawl herself,
I&rsquo;m not sure how much longer she&rsquo;ll hold anybody. The
rest think they can argue with me! Yesterday, Sumeko called me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>girl</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She bared her teeth, but it was all her own fault,
one way and another. After all, she was the one who had hammered at
the Kin that they ought to show some backbone instead of groveling
to Aes Sedai. Well, they certainly had stopped groveling. Instead,
they were all too likely to hold sisters up to the standard of
their Rule. And find the sister wanting! It might not be
Nynaeve&rsquo;s fault, exactly, that she appeared to be little more
than twenty&mdash;she had slowed early&mdash;but age was
important to the Kin, and she had chosen to spend most of her time
with them. She was not jerking her braid, just pulling at it so
steadily it must be ready to pull free of her scalp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And those cursed Sea Folk! Wretched women! Wretched;
wretched; wretched! If it wasn&rsquo;t for that bloody <em>
bargain</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;! The last thing I need on my hands is a couple
of whining, bleating novices!&rdquo; Kirstian&rsquo;s lips thinned for an
instant, and Zarya&rsquo;s dark eyes flashed indignation before she
managed to assume meekness again. A semblance of it. They had sense
enough to know that novices did not open their mouths to Aes Sedai,
though.</p>

<p>Elayne shoved down the desire to smooth everything
over. She wanted to slap Kirstian and Zarya both. They had
complicated everything by not keeping their mouths shut in the
first place. She wanted to slap Nynaeve. So she finally had been
cornered by the Windfinders, had she? That earned no sympathy.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not <em>playing</em> at anything, Nynaeve, and you well
know it! I have asked your advice often enough!&rdquo; Drawing a deep
breath, she tried to calm herself. The servants she could see
beyond Vandene and the two novices had paused in their work to
goggle at the cluster of women. She doubted they more than noticed
Lan, impressive as he was. Arguing Aes Sedai were something to
watch, and stay clear of. &ldquo;Someone has to take charge of them,&rdquo; she
said more quietly. &ldquo;Or do you think you can just tell them to
forget all this? Look at them, Nynaeve. Left to themselves, they
will be trying to find out who it is in a heartbeat. They
wouldn&rsquo;t have gone to Vandene unless they thought she would
let them help.&rdquo; The pair became pictures of wide-eyed novice
innocence, with just a hint of offense at an unjust accusation.
Elayne did not believe it. They had had a lifetime to work on
disguising themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; Nynaeve said after a moment, shifting
her shawl. &ldquo;Light, Elayne, you have to remember they aren&rsquo;t
what we normally expect in novices.&rdquo; Elayne opened her mouth in
protest&mdash;what we normally expect, indeed!&mdash;Nynaeve
might never have been a novice, but she had been Accepted not all
that long ago; a whining, bleating Accepted, often enough, too!&mdash;she opened her mouth, and Nynaeve went right on. &ldquo;Vandene
can make good use of them, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And when she
isn&rsquo;t, she can give them regular lessons. I remember someone
telling me you&rsquo;ve taught novices before, Vandene. There.
It&rsquo;s settled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two novices smiled broad, eager smiles of
anticipation&mdash;they all but rubbed their hands together in
satisfaction&mdash;but Vandene scowled. &ldquo;I do not need novices
getting under my feet while I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just as blind as Elayne,&rdquo; Nynaeve broke
in. &ldquo;They have experience making Aes Sedai take them for something
other than what they are. They can work at your direction, and that
will give you time to sleep and eat. I don&rsquo;t believe
you&rsquo;re doing either.&rdquo; She drew herself up, draping her shawl
across her shoulders and along her arms. It was quite a
performance. Short as she was, no taller than Zarya and markedly
shorter than Vandene or Kirstian, she managed to seem the tallest
one there by inches. It was a skill Elayne wished she could master.
Although she would not try in a dress cut that way. Nynaeve was in
danger of coming right out. Still, that did not diminish her
presence. She was the essence of command. &ldquo;You will do it,
Vandene,&rdquo; she said firmly.</p>

<p>Vandene&rsquo;s scowl faded slowly, but fade it did.
Nynaeve stood higher in the Power than she, and even if she never
consciously thought of the fact, deeply ingrained custom made her
yield, however unwillingly. By the time she turned to the two women
in white, her face was as near composed as it had been since
Adeleas&rsquo; murder. Which just meant that the judge might not
order an execution right now. Later, perhaps. Her gaunt face was
calm, and starkly grim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did teach novices for a time,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;A short
time. The Mistress of Novices thought I was too hard on my
students.&rdquo; The pair&rsquo;s eagerness cooled a bit. &ldquo;Her name was
Sereille Bagand.&rdquo; Zarya&rsquo;s face went as pale as
Kirstian&rsquo;s, and Kirstian swayed as if suddenly dizzy. As
Mistress of Novices and later Amyrlin Seat, Sereille was a legend.
The sort of legend that made you wake in the middle of the night
sweating. &ldquo;I do eat,&rdquo; Vandene said to Nynaeve. &ldquo;But everything
tastes like ashes.&rdquo; With a curt gesture at the two novices, she led
them away past Lan. They were staggering slightly as they
followed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stubborn woman,&rdquo; Nynaeve grumbled, frowning at the
re treating backs, but there was more than a hint of sympathy in
her voice. &ldquo;I know a dozen herbs that would help her sleep, but she
won&rsquo;t touch them. I&rsquo;ve half a mind to slip something into
her evening wine.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>A wise ruler</em>, Elayne thought, <em>knows when
to speak and when not</em>. Well, that was wisdom in anyone. She
did not say that Nynaeve calling anyone stubborn was the rooster
calling the pheasant proud. &ldquo;Do you know what Reanne&rsquo;s news
is?&rdquo; she said instead. &ldquo;Good news&mdash;&lsquo;of a sort&rsquo;&mdash;so I understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen her this morning,&rdquo; the other
woman muttered, still peering after Vandene. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been
out of my rooms.&rdquo; Abruptly she gave herself a shake, and for some
reason frowned suspiciously at Elayne. And then at Lan, of all
things. Unperturbed, he continued to stand guard.</p>

<p>Nynaeve claimed her marriage was glorious&mdash;she
could be <em>shockingly</em> frank about it with other women&mdash;but Elayne thought she must be lying to cover up disappointment.
Very likely Lan was ready for an attack, ready to fight, even when
asleep. It would be like lying down beside a hungry lion. Besides,
that stone face was enough to chill any marriage bed. Luckily,
Nynaeve had no idea what she thought. The woman actually smiled. An
amused smile, oddly. Amused, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;could it be condescending?
Of course not. Imagination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know where Reanne is,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, settling her
shawl back down to her elbows. &ldquo;Come with me. I&rsquo;ll take you to
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne knew exactly where Reanne would be, since she
was not closeted with Nynaeve, but once again she schooled her
tongue, and let Nynaeve lead her. A sort of penance for arguing
earlier, when she should have tried to make peace. Lan followed,
those cold eyes scanning the halls. The servants they passed
flinched when Lan&rsquo;s gaze fell on them. A youngish, pale-haired
woman actually gathered her skirts and ran, bumping into a
stand-lamp and setting it rocking in her flight.</p>

<p>That reminded Elayne to tell Nynaeve about Elenia and
Naean, and about the spies. Nynaeve took it quite calmly. She
agreed with Elayne that they would know soon enough who had rescued
the two women, with a dismissive sniff for Sareitha&rsquo;s doubts.
For that matter, she expressed surprise that they had not been
taken right from Aringill long since. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t believe they
were still there when we arrived in Caemlyn. Any fool could see
they would be brought here sooner or later. Much easier to get them
out of a small town.&rdquo; A small town. Aringill would have seemed a
great city to her, once. &ldquo;As for spies&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She frowned at a
lanky, gray-haired man filling a gold-worked stand-lamp with oil,
and shook her head. &ldquo;Of course there are spies. I knew there must
be, right from the start. You just have to watch what you say,
Elayne. Don&rsquo;t say anything to anyone you don&rsquo;t know well
unless you don&rsquo;t mind everyone knowing.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>When to speak and when not</em>, Elayne thought,
pursing her lips. Sometimes that could be a true penance, with
Nynaeve.</p>

<p>Nynaeve had her own information to impart. Eighteen
of the Kin who had accompanied them to Caemlyn were no longer in
the Palace. They had not run away, though. Since none was strong
enough to Travel, Nynaeve had woven the gateways herself, sending
them deep into Altara and Amadicia and Tarabon, into the
Seanchan-held lands where they would try to find any of the Kin who
had not already fled and bring them back to Caemlyn.</p>

<p>It would have been nice if Nynaeve had thought to
inform her yesterday, when they left, or better yet, when she and
Reanne reached the decision to send them, but Elayne did not
mention that. Instead, she said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very brave of them.
Avoiding capture won&rsquo;t be easy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brave, yes,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, sounding irritated. Her
hand crept up to her braid again. &ldquo;But that isn&rsquo;t why we chose
them. Alise thought they were the most likely to run if we
didn&rsquo;t give them something to do.&rdquo; Glancing over her shoulder
at Lan, she snatched her hand back down. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how
Egwene means to do it,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;All very well to say every one
of the Kin will be &lsquo;associated&rsquo; with the Tower somehow,
but how? Most aren&rsquo;t strong enough to earn the shawl. Many
can&rsquo;t even reach Accepted. And they certainly won&rsquo;t stand
for being novices or Accepted the rest of their lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This time Elayne said nothing because she did not
know what to say. The promise had to be kept; she had made it
herself. In Egwene&rsquo;s name, true, and at Egwene&rsquo;s order,
but she had spoken the words herself, and she would not break her
word. Only, she did not see how to keep it unless Egwene came up
with something truly wonderful.</p>

<p>Reanne Corly was just where Elayne had known she
would be, in a small room with two narrow windows looking down on a
small, fountained courtyard deep in the Palace, though the fountain
was dry, this time of year, and the glass casements made the room a
little stuffy. The floor was plain dark tile with no carpet, and
for furnishings there were only a narrow table and two chairs.
There were two people with Reanne when Elayne entered. Alise
Tenjile, in simple high-necked gray, looked up from where she stood
at the end of the table. Seemingly in her middle years, she was a
woman of pleasant, unremarkable appearance who was quite remarkable
indeed once you came to know her and could be very unpleasant
indeed when it was called for. A single glance, and she returned to
her study of what was going on at the table. Aes Sedai, Warders and
Daughter-Heirs did not impress Alise, not any longer. Reanne
herself was sitting on one side of the table, her face creased and
her hair more gray than not, in a green dress more elaborate than
Alise&rsquo;s; she had been put out of the Tower after failing her
test for Accepted, and offered a second chance, she had already
adopted the colors of her preferred Ajah. Across from her sat a
plump woman in plain brown wool, her face set in stubborn defiance
and her dark eyes locked on Reanne, avoiding the silvery segmented
<em>a&rsquo;dam</em> lying like a snake between them on the table.
Her hands stroked the edge of the tabletop, though, and Reanne wore
a confident smile that deepened the fine lines at the corners of
her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me you have made one of them see
reason,&rdquo; Nynaeve said before Lan had even shut the door behind
them. She scowled at the woman in brown as though she wanted to box
her ears if not worse, then glanced at Alise. Elayne thought
Nynaeve was a little in awe of Alise. The woman was far from strong
in the Power&mdash;she would never attain the shawl&mdash;but she
had a way of taking charge when she wanted to and making everyone
around her accept it. Including Aes Sedai. Elayne thought she might
be just a little in awe of Alise herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They still deny they can channel,&rdquo; Alise muttered,
folding her arms beneath her breasts, and frowned at the woman
facing Reanne. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t, really, I suppose, but I can feel&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;something. Not quite the spark of a woman born to it, but
almost. It&rsquo;s as if she were right at the brink of being able
to channel, one foot poised to step over. I have never sensed
anything like it before. Well. At least they don&rsquo;t try to
attack us with their fists anymore. I think I put them straight on
that, at least!&rdquo; The woman in brown flashed a sullen, angry glare
at her, but jerked her eyes away from Alise&rsquo;s firm gaze, her
mouth twisting in a sickly grimace. When Alise set somebody
straight, they were set very straight indeed. Her hands continued
to shift along the tabletop; Elayne did not think she was aware of
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They still deny seeing the flows, too, but
they&rsquo;re trying to convince themselves,&rdquo; Reanne said in her
high, musical voice. She continued to meet the other&rsquo;s
obstinate stare with a smile. Any sister might have envied
Reanne&rsquo;s serenity and presence. She had been Eldest of the
Knitting Circle, the highest authority among the Kin. According to
their Rule, the Knitting Circle existed only in Ebou Dar, but she
was still the oldest among those in Caemlyn, a hundred years older
than any Aes Sedai in living memory, and she could match any sister
with her air of calm command. &ldquo;They claim we trick them with the
Power, use it to make them believe the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> can hold
them. Sooner or later, they will run out of lies.&rdquo; Drawing the <em>
a&rsquo;dam</em> to her, she opened the collar&rsquo;s catch with a
deft motion. &ldquo;Shall we try again, Marli?&rdquo; The woman in brown&mdash;Marli&mdash;still avoided looking at the length of silver metal in
Reanne&rsquo;s hands, but she stiffened and her hands fluttered on
the table&rsquo;s edge.</p>

<p>Elayne sighed. What a gift Rand had sent her. A gift!
Twenty-nine Seanchan <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> neatly held by <em>
a&rsquo;dam</em>, and five <em>damane</em>&mdash;she hated that
word; it meant Leashed One, or simply Leashed; but that was what
they were&mdash;five <em>damane</em> who could not be uncollared
for the simple reason that they would try to free the Seanchan
women who had held them prisoner. Leopards tied with string would
have been a better gift. At least leopards could not channel. They
had been given into the Kin&rsquo;s keeping because no one else had
the time.</p>

<p>Still, she had seen right away what to do with the
<em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>. Convince them that they could learn to
channel, then send them back to the Seanchan. Apart from Nynaeve,
only Egwene, Aviendha and a few of the Kin knew her plan. Nynaeve
and Egwene were doubtful, but however hard the <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em> tried to hide what they were once they were
returned, eventually one would slip. If they did not just report
everything right away. Seanchan were peculiar; even the Seanchan
among the <em>damane</em> truly believed that any woman who could
channel had to be collared for the safety of everyone else. <em>
Sul&rsquo;dam</em>, with their ability to control women wearing the
<em>a&rsquo;dam</em>, were highly respected among the Seanchan. The
knowledge that <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> themselves were able to
channel would shake the Seanchan to their core, maybe even break
them apart. It had seemed so simple, in the beginning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reanne, I understood that you had good news,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;If the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> haven&rsquo;t started breaking
down, what is it?&rdquo; Alise frowned at Lan, who stood silent guard in
front of the door&mdash;she disapproved of him knowing their plans&mdash;but she said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A moment, if you please,&rdquo; Reanne murmured. It was
not really a request. Nynaeve truly had done her job too well.
&ldquo;There is no need for her to listen.&rdquo; The glow of <em>saidar</em>
suddenly shone around her. She moved her fingers as she channeled,
as though guiding the flows of air that bound Marli to her chair,
then tied them off and cupped her hands as though shaping in her
sight the ward against sound that she wove around the woman. The
gestures were no part of channeling, of course, but necessary to
her, since she had learned the weaves that way. The <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em>&rsquo;s lips twisted slightly in contempt. The One
Power did not frighten her at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take your time,&rdquo; Nynaeve put in acidly, planting her
hands on her hips. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no hurry.&rdquo; Reanne did not
intimidate her the way Alise did.</p>

<p>Then again, Nynaeve no longer intimidated Reanne,
either. Reanne did take her time, studying her handiwork, then
nodded with satisfaction before rising. The Kin had always tried to
channel as little as was necessary, and she took great pleasure in
the freedom to use <em>saidar</em> as often as she wished, as well
as pride in weaving well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The good news,&rdquo; she said, standing and smoothing her
skirts, &ldquo;is that three of the <em>damane</em> seem ready to be let
out of their collars. Perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s eyebrows rose, and she exchanged
surprised looks with Nynaeve. Of the five <em>damane</em> Taim had
handed over to them, one had been taken by the Seanchan on Toman
Head and another in Tanchico. The others had come from
Seanchan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two of the Seanchan women, Marille and Jillari,
still say they <em>deserve</em> to be collared, <em>need</em> to be
collared.&rdquo; Reanne&rsquo;s mouth tightened with distaste, but she
paused for only a moment. &ldquo;They truly seem horrified at the
prospect of freedom. Alivia has stopped that. Now she says it was
only because she was afraid she would be retaken. She says she
hates all the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>, and she certainly makes a good
show of it, snarling at them and cursing them, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She shook
her head slowly in doubt. &ldquo;She was collared at thirteen or
fourteen, Elayne, she&rsquo;s not certain which, and she&rsquo;s been
<em>damane</em> for <em>four hundred years!</em> And aside from
that, she is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she&rsquo;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Alivia is considerably stronger
than Nynaeve,&rdquo; she finished in a rush. Age, the Kin might discuss
openly, but they had all the Aes Sedai reticence about speaking of
strength in the Power. &ldquo;Do we dare let her free? A Seanchan wilder
who could tear the entire Palace apart?&rdquo; The Kin shared the Aes
Sedai view of wilders, too. Most did.</p>

<p>Sisters who knew Nynaeve had learned to take care
with that word around her. She could become quite snappish when it
was used in a disparaging tone. Now, she just stared at Reanne.
Perhaps she was trying to find the answer. Elayne knew what her own
answer would be, but this had nothing to do with claiming the
throne, or Andor. It was a decision for Aes Sedai, and here, that
meant it was Nynaeve&rsquo;s to make.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Lan said quietly from the door,
&ldquo;then you might as well give her back to the Seanchan.&rdquo; He was not
at all abashed by the dark looks given him by the four women who
heard his deep voice toll those words like a funeral gong. &ldquo;You
will have to watch her closely, but keep her collared when she
wants to be free, and you are no better than they are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t for you to say, Warder,&rdquo; Alise said
firmly. He met her stern stare with cool equanimity, and she gave a
small disgusted grunt and threw up her hands. &ldquo;You should give him
a good talking-to when you get him alone, Nynaeve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve must have been feeling her awe of the women
particularly strongly, because her cheeks colored. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
think that I will not,&rdquo; she said lightly. She did not look at Lan
at all. Finally condescending to notice the chill, she pulled her
shawl up onto her shoulders, and cleared her throat. &ldquo;He is right,
though. At least we don&rsquo;t have to worry about the other two.
I&rsquo;m just surprised it took them this long to stop imitating
those fool Seanchan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not so sure,&rdquo; Reanne sighed. &ldquo;Kara was a sort
of wise woman on Toman Head, you know. Very influential in her
village. A wilder, of course. You would think she&rsquo;d hate the
Seanchan, but she doesn&rsquo;t, not all of them. She is very fond
of the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> captured with her, and very anxious
that we shouldn&rsquo;t hurt any of the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>.
Lemore is just nineteen, a pampered noblewoman with the extreme bad
luck to have the spark manifest itself in her on the very day
Tanchico fell. She says she hates the Seanchan and wants to make
them pay for what they did to Tanchico, but she answers to Larie,
her <em>damane</em> name, as readily as to Lemore, and she smiles
at the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> and lets them pet her. I don&rsquo;t
mistrust them, not the way I do Alivia, but I doubt either one
could stand up to a <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>. I think if a <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em> ordered either to help her escape, she would, and
I fear she might not fight too hard if the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>
tried to collar her again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After she stopped speaking, the silence
stretched.</p>

<p>Nynaeve seemed to look inward, struggling with
herself. She gripped her braid, then let go and folded her arms
tight across her chest, the fringe of her shawl swaying as she
hugged herself. She glared at everyone except Lan. Him, she did not
so much as glance at.</p>

<p>Finally she took a deep breath, and squared herself
to face Reanne and Alise. &ldquo;We must remove the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>.
We will hold on to them until we can be sure&mdash;and Lemore
after; she needs to be put in white!&mdash;and we will make sure
they are never left alone, especially with the <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em>, but the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> come off!&rdquo; She spoke
fiercely, as if expecting opposition, but a broad smile of approval
spread across Elayne&rsquo;s face. The addition of three more women
they could not be sure of hardly counted as good news, but there
had been no other choice.</p>

<p>Reanne merely nodded acceptance&mdash;after a moment&mdash;but a smiling Alise came around the table to pat
Nynaeve&rsquo;s shoulder, and Nynaeve actually blushed. She tried to
hide it behind clearing her throat roughly and grimacing at the
Seanchan woman in her cage of <em>saidar</em>, but her efforts were
not very effectual, and Lan spoiled them in any case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Tai&rsquo;shar Manetheren</em>,&rdquo; he said
softly.</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s mouth fell open, then curled into a
tremulous smile. Sudden tears glistened in her eyes as she spun to
face him, her face joyous. He smiled back at her, and there was
nothing cold in his eyes.</p>

<p>Elayne struggled not to gape. Light! Maybe he did not
chill their marriage bed after all. The thought made her cheeks
warm. Trying not to look at them, her eyes fell on Marli, still
fastened in her chair. The Seanchan woman was staring straight
ahead, tears flowing down her plump cheeks. Straight ahead. At the
weaves holding sound away from her. She could not deny seeing the
weaves now. But when she said as much, Reanne shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They all weep if they are made to look at weaves
very long, Elayne,&rdquo; she said wearily. And a touch sadly. &ldquo;But once
the weaves are gone, they convince themselves we tricked them. They
have to, you understand. Else they&rsquo;d be <em>damane</em>, not
<em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>. No, it will take time to convince the
Mistress of the Hounds that she is really a hound herself. I am
afraid I really haven&rsquo;t given you any good news at all, have
I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not very much,&rdquo; Elayne told her. None, really. Just
another problem to stack up on all the rest. How much bad news
could be stacked before the pile buried you? She had to get some
good, soon.</p>
