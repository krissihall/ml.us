<h4><em>A Portion of Wisdom</em></h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
Golden Wheel was a large inn, just off the
Avharin Market, with a long, beam-ceilinged common room crowded
with small square tables. Even at midday no more than one table in
five had anyone sitting at it, though, usually an outland merchant
facing a woman in sober colors with her hair worn on top of her
head or gathered up at the nape other neck. The women were
merchants, too, or bankers; in Far Madding, banking and trade were
forbidden to men. All the foreigners in the common room were male,
since the women among them could be taken into the Women&rsquo;s
Room. The smells of fish and mutton cooking in the kitchens filled
the air, and occasionally a shout from one of the tables summoned
one of the serving men who waited in a line at the back of the
room. Otherwise, the merchants and bankers kept their voices low.
The sound of the rain outside was louder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you certain?&rdquo; Rand asked, taking the creased
drawings back from a lantern-jawed serving man he had drawn off to
one side of the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s him,&rdquo; the fellow said uncertainly,
wiping his hands on a long apron embroidered with a yellow wagon
wheel. &ldquo;It looks like him. He should be back soon.&rdquo; His eyes darted
beyond Rand, and he sighed. &ldquo;You better buy a drink or go. Mistress
Gallger doesn&rsquo;t like us talking when we should be working. And
she wouldn&rsquo;t like me talking about her patrons any time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand glanced over his shoulder. A lean woman with a
tall ivory comb stuck in the dark bun on the back of her head was
standing in the yellow-painted arch that led to the Women&rsquo;s
Room. The way she looked over the common room&mdash;half queen
surveying her domain, half farmer surveying her fields, and either
way displeased with the sparsity of trade she saw&mdash;named her
the innkeeper. When her gaze fell on Rand and the lantern-jawed
fellow, she frowned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mulled wine,&rdquo; Rand said, handing the man some coins,
coppers for the wine and a silver mark for his information,
uncertain as it was. More than a week had passed since he had
killed Rochaid and Kisman had gotten away, and in all those days
this was the first time he had gotten more than a shrug or a shake
of the head when he showed the drawings.</p>

<p>There were a dozen empty tables right at hand, but he
wanted to be in a corner at the front of the room, where he could
see who came in without being seen himself, and as he edged his way
between the tables, snatches of conversation caught his ear.</p>

<p>A tall pale woman in dark green silk shook her head
at a stocky man in a tight-fitting black Tairen coat. An iron-gray
bun made her look a little like Cadsuane from the side. He appeared
to be made of stone blocks, but his dark square face was worried.
&ldquo;You can put your mind at ease about Andor, Master Admira,&rdquo; she
said soothingly. &ldquo;Believe me, the Andorans will shout and shake
swords at one another, but they&rsquo;ll never let it come to actual
fighting. It is in your best interests to stay with the present
route for your goods. Cairhien would tax you a fifth more than Far
Madding. Think of the added expense.&rdquo; The Tairen grimaced as if he
were thinking of it. Or wondering whether his best interests really
coincided with hers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear the body did be all black and swollen,&rdquo; a
lean, white-bearded Illianer in a dark blue coat said at another
table. &ldquo;I hear the Counsels did order it burned.&rdquo; He raised his
eyebrows significantly and tapped the side of a pointed nose that
gave him the appearance of a weasel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there was <em>plague</em> in the city, Master
Azereos, the Counsels would have announced it,&rdquo; the slim woman
sitting across from him said calmly. With two elaborate ivory combs
in her rolled hair, she was pretty, in a fox-faced way, and cool as
an Aes Sedai, though with faint lines at the corners other brown
eyes. &ldquo;I really do suggest against moving <em>any</em> of your
trade to Lugard. Murandy is most unsettled. The nobles will <em>
never</em> stand for Roedran building an army. And there are <em>
Aes Sedai</em> involved, as I&rsquo;m sure you have heard. The Light
alone knows what <em>they</em> will do.&rdquo; The Illianer shrugged
uncomfortably. These days, no one was very certain what Aes Sedai
would do, if they ever had been.</p>

<p>A Kandori with gray streaks in his forked beard and a
large pearl in his left ear was leaning toward a stout woman in
dark gray silk who wore her black hair in a tight roll along the
top of her head. &ldquo;I hear the Dragon Reborn has been crowned King of
Illian, Mistress Shimel.&rdquo; A frown put more wrinkles in his
forehead. &ldquo;Given the White Tower&rsquo;s proclamation, I am
considering sending my spring wagons to travel along the Erinin to
Tear. The River Road may be a harder route, but Illian is not such
a market for furs that I want to take too many risks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stout woman smiled, a very thin smile for such a
round face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m told the man has hardly been seen in Illian
since he took the crown, Master Posavina. In any case, the Tower
will deal with him, if it hasn&rsquo;t already, and this morning, I
received word that the Stone of Tear is under siege. That is hardly
a situation where you will find much market for furs, now it? No,
Tear is not a place to avoid risks.&rdquo; The wrinkles in Master
Posavina&rsquo;s forehead deepened.</p>

<p>Reaching a small table in the corner, Rand tossed his
cloak over the back of the chair and sat with his back to the wall,
turning up his collar. The lantern-jawed fellow brought a steaming
pewter cup of spiced wine, murmured a hurried thanks for the
silver, and scurried off at a shout from another table. Two large
fireplaces on either side of the room took the chill off the air,
but if anyone noticed that Rand kept his gloves on, no one glanced
at him twice. He pretended to stare into the winecup between his
hands on the table while keeping an eye on the door to the
street.</p>

<p>Most of what he had overheard did not interest him
greatly. He had heard as much before, and sometimes knew more than
the people he eavesdropped on. Elayne agreed with the pale woman,
for example, and she had to know Andor better than any Far Madding
merchant. The Stone under siege was new, though. Still, he need not
trouble himself with it yet. The Stone had never fallen, except to
him, and he knew Alanna was somewhere in Tear. He had felt her leap
from just north of Far Madding to somewhere much farther north,
then, a day later, to somewhere far to the south and east. She was
distant enough that he could not say whether she was in Haddon Mirk
or the city of Tear itself, yet he was confident she was one place
or the other, with four other sisters he could trust. If Merana and
Rafela could get what he wanted from the Sea Folk, they could from
the Tairens, too. Rafela was Tairen, and that should help. No, the
world could get along without him a little longer. It had to.</p>

<p>A tall man swathed in a long, damp cloak with the
hood hiding his face came in from the street, and Rand&rsquo;s eyes
followed him to the stairs at the back of the room. Starting up,
the fellow threw back his cowl, revealing a fringe of gray hair and
a pale pinched face. He could not be the one the serving man meant.
No one with eyes would confuse him with Peral Torval.</p>

<p>Rand went back to studying the surface of his wine,
his thoughts turning sour. Min and Nynaeve had refused to spend one
more hour tramping the streets, as Min had put it, and he suspected
Alivia was only going through the motions of showing the drawings.
When she did even that. They were all three out of the city for the
day, in the hills, he judged from what the bond told him of Min.
She felt very excited about something. The three of them believed
Kisman had fled after failing to kill Rand, and the other renegades
had either gone with him or never come at all. They had all been
trying to talk him into leaving for days, now. At least Lan had not
given up.</p>

<p><em>Why can&rsquo;t the women be right?</em> Lews
Therin whispered fiercely in his head. <em>This city is worse than
any prison. There is no</em> Source here! <em>Why would they stay?
Why would</em> any <em>sane man stay? We could ride out, beyond the
barrier, just for a day, a few hours. Light, just for a few
hours!</em> The voice laughed uncontrollably, wildly. <em>Oh,
Light, why do I have a madman in my head? Why? Why?</em></p>

<p>Angrily, Rand forced Lews Therin to a muted hum, like
a biteme buzzing nearby. He had thought about accompanying the
women on their ride, just to feel the Source again, though only Min
had shown much enthusiasm. Nynaeve and Alivia would not admit why
they wanted to ride out when the morning sky had promised the rain
that was pouring down outside now. This was not the first time they
had gone. To feel the Source, he suspected. To drink in the One
Power again, if only for a short time. Well, he could endure not
being able to channel. He could endure the absence of the Source.
He could! He had to, so he could kill the men who had tried to kill
him.</p>

<p><em>That is not the reason!</em> Lews Therin shouted,
forcing past Rand&rsquo;s efforts to shut him up. <em>You are
afraid! If the sickness takes you while you are trying to use the
access</em> ter&rsquo;angreal<em>, it could kill you, or worse! It
could kill us all!</em> he moaned.</p>

<p>Wine slopped over Rand&rsquo;s wrist, soaking his
coatsleeve, and he loosened his grip on the winecup. The thing had
not been in true round to begin with, and he did not think he had
bent it enough to be noticed. He was <em>not</em> afraid! He
refused to let fear touch him. Light, he had to die, eventually. He
had accepted that.</p>

<p><em>They tried to kill me, and I want them dead for
it</em>, he thought. <em>If it takes a little time, well, maybe the
sickness will pass by then. Burn you, I have to live until the Last
Battle</em>. In his head, Lews Therin laughed more wildly than
before.</p>

<p>Another tall man swaggered in, through the door to
the stableyard, almost at the foot of the stairs in the back of the
room. Shaking rain from his cloak, he tossed back his hood and
strode to the doorway of the Women&rsquo;s Room. With his sneering
mouth and sharp nose, and a gaze that swept contemptuously over the
people at the tables, he did look something like Torval, but with
twenty years&rsquo; more wear on his face and thirty pounds of fat
on his frame. Peering through the yellow arch, he called out in a
high, prissy voice that was thick with the accents of Illian.
&ldquo;Mistress Gallger, I do be leaving in the morning. Early, so I do
expect no charges for tomorrow, mind!&rdquo; Torval was a Taraboner.</p>

<p>Gathering his cloak, Rand left his winecup on the
table and did not look back.</p>

<p>The noon sky was gray and cold, and if the rain had
slackened, it was not by much, and driven by blustery lake winds,
it was enough to have driven almost everyone from the streets. He
held the cloak around him one-handed, as much to shelter the
drawings in his coat pocket as to keep the rest of him dry, and
used the other to hold his hood against the gusts. The windblown
raindrops hit his face like flecks of ice. A lone sedan chair
passed him, the bearers&rsquo; hair hanging sodden down their backs
and their boots splashing in puddles on the paving stones. A few
people trudged along the streets wrapped up in their cloaks. There
were hours of daylight left, such as it was, but he walked by an
inn called The Heart of the Plain without going in, and then by The
Three Ladies of Maredo. He told himself it was the rain. This was
no weather to be making his way from inn to inn. He knew he was
lying, though.</p>

<p>A short stout woman coming down the street bundled in
a dark cloak suddenly veered toward him. When she stopped in front
of him and raised her head, he saw it was Verin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you are here after all,&rdquo; she said. Raindrops fell
on her upturned face, but she did not seem to notice. &ldquo;Your
innkeeper thought you intended to walk up to the Avharin, but she
was not sure. I&rsquo;m afraid Mistress Keene doesn&rsquo;t pay much
attention to the comings and goings of men. And here I am with my
shoes soaked through, and my stockings. I used to like walking in
the rain when I was a girl, but it seems to have lost its charm
somewhere along the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Cadsuane send you?&rdquo; he asked, trying to keep his
voice from sounding hopeful. He had kept his room at The
Counsel&rsquo;s Head after Alanna left so that Cadsuane could find
him. He could hardly make her interested if she had to hunt for him
inn by inn. Especially since she had shown no evidence that she
would hunt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; she would never do that.&rdquo; Verin sounded
surprised at the thought. &ldquo;I just thought you might want to hear
the news. Cadsuane is out riding with the girls.&rdquo; She frowned
thoughtfully, tilting her head. &ldquo;Though I suppose I shouldn&rsquo;t
call Alivia a girl. An intriguing woman. Much too old to become a
novice, unfortunately; oh, yes, very unfortunate. She drinks in
whatever she&rsquo;s taught. I believe she may know almost every way
there is to destroy something with the Power, but she knows almost
nothing else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew her to the side of the street, where the deep
over hanging eaves of a single-story stone house gave a little
shelter from the rain, if not from the wind to any great extent.
Cadsuane was with Min and the others? It might mean nothing. He had
seen Aes Sedai fascinated with Nynaeve before, and according to
Min, Alivia was even stronger. &ldquo;What news, Verin?&rdquo; he said
quietly.</p>

<p>The round little Aes Sedai blinked as though she
forgotten there was any news, then smiled suddenly. &ldquo;Oh, yes. The
Seanchan. They are in Illian. Not the city, not yet; no need to go
pale. But they have crossed the border. They are building fortified
camps along the coast and inland. I know little of military
matters. I always skip over the battles when I read a history. But
it does seem to me that whether they are in the city yet or not,
that is where they are aiming. Your battles don&rsquo;t seem to have
done much to slow them. That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t read about the
battles. They seldom seem to alter anything in the long run, only
in the short. Are you well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He forced his eyes open. Verin peered up at him like
a chubby sparrow. All that fighting, all those men dead, men he had
killed, and it had changed nothing. Nothing!</p>

<p><em>She is wrong</em>, Lews Therin murmured in his
head. <em>Battles can alter history</em>. He did not sound pleased
with it. <em>The trouble is, sometimes you cannot say how history
will be changed until it is too late</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Verin, if I went to Cadsuane, would she talk with
me? About something other than how my manners don&rsquo;t suit her?
That&rsquo;s all she ever seems to care about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear. I&rsquo;m afraid Cadsuane is very much a
traditionalist in some ways, Rand. I&rsquo;ve never actually heard
her call a man uppity, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She laid fingertips against her
mouth in thought for a moment, then nodded, raindrops sliding down
her face. &ldquo;I believe she will listen to what you have to say, if
you can manage to erase the bad impression you made on her. Or at
least smudge it, as much as you can. Few sisters are impressed by
titles or crowns, Rand, and Cadsuane less than any other I know.
She cares much more about whether or not people are fools. If you
can show her you aren&rsquo;t a fool, she will listen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then tell her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He drew a deep breath. Light,
he wanted to strangle Kisman and Dashiva and all of them with his
bare hands! &ldquo;Tell her I&rsquo;ll be leaving Far Madding tomorrow,
and I hope she will come with me, as my advisor.&rdquo; Lews Therin
sighed with relief at the first part of that; if he had been more
than a voice, Rand would have said he stiffened at the second part.
&ldquo;Tell her I accept her terms; I apologize for my behavior in
Cairhien, and I will do my best to watch my manners in the future.&rdquo;
Saying that hardly grated at all. Well, a little, but unless Min
was wrong, he needed Cadsuane, and Min was never wrong with her
viewings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you found what you are after here?&rdquo; He frowned at
her, and she smiled back and patted his arm. &ldquo;If you had come to
Far Madding thinking you could conquer the city by announcing who
you are, you would have left as soon as you realized you cannot
channel here. That leaves wanting to find something, or
someone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe I found what I need,&rdquo; he said curtly. Just not
what he wanted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then come to the Barsalla palace, on the Heights,
this evening, Rand. Anyone can tell you how to find it. I really am
sure she will be willing to listen to you.&rdquo; Shifting her cloak, she
seemed to notice the dampness of the wool for the first time. &ldquo;Oh,
my. I must go dry off. I suggest you do the same.&rdquo; Half turned to
leave, she paused and looked back over her shoulder at him. Her
dark eyes were unblinking. Suddenly she did not sound muddled at
all. &ldquo;You could do far worse than Cadsuane for an advisor, Rand,
but I doubt you could do better. If she accepts, and you truly are
not a fool, you will listen to her advice.&rdquo; She glided away through
the rain looking nothing so much as a very stout swan.</p>

<p><em>Sometimes that woman frightens me</em>, Lews
Therin murmured, and Rand nodded. Cadsuane did not frighten him,
but she made him wary. Any Aes Sedai who had not sworn to him made
him wary, except for Nynaeve. And he was not always certain of her,
either.</p>

<p>The rain died away while he was walking the two miles
back to The Counsel&rsquo;s Head, but the wind picked up, and the
sign over the door, painted with the stern visage of a woman
wearing the jeweled coronet of a First Counsel, swung on creaking
hinges. The common room was smaller than that of The Golden Wheel,
but the wall panels were carved and polished, the tables beneath
the red ceiling beams not so crowded together. The doorway to the
Women&rsquo;s Room was red, too, and carved like intricate lace, as
were the lintels of the pale marble fireplaces. At The
Counsel&rsquo;s Head, the serving men secured their long hair with
polished silver clips. Only two of them were to be seen, standing
near the kitchen door, but there were just three men at the tables,
foreign merchants sitting far apart, each engrossed in his own
wine. Competitors, perhaps, since now and then one or another would
shift on his chair and frown at the other two. One, a graying man,
wore a dark gray silk coat, and a lean fellow with a hard face had
a red stone the size of a pigeon&rsquo;s egg in his ear. The
Counsel&rsquo;s Head catered to the wealthier outland merchants, and
there were not many of those in Far Madding at present.</p>

<p>The clock on a mantel in the Women&rsquo;s Room&mdash;a clock with a silver case, so Min said&mdash;rang the hour with
small bells as he came into the common room, and before he had
finished shaking out his cloak, Lan entered. As soon as the Warder
met Rand&rsquo;s eye, he shook his head. Well, Rand had not really
expected to find them at this point. Even for a <em>
ta&rsquo;veren</em>, that might be pushing the impossible.</p>

<p>Once they both had steaming cups of wine and were
settled on a long red bench in front of one of the fireplaces, he
told Lan what he had decided, and why. Part of why. The important
part. &ldquo;If I had my hands on them right this minute, I&rsquo;d kill
them and take my chances escaping, but killing them changes
nothing. It doesn&rsquo;t change enough, anyway,&rdquo; he corrected,
frowning into the flames. &ldquo;I can wait one more day, hoping to find
them tomorrow, for weeks. Months. Only, the world won&rsquo;t wait
for me. I thought I&rsquo;d be done with them by now, but events are
already marching ahead of what I expected. Just the events I know
about. Light, what&rsquo;s happening that I don&rsquo;t know about
because I haven&rsquo;t heard some merchant nattering about it over
his wine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can never know everything,&rdquo; Lan said quietly,
&ldquo;and part of what you know is always wrong. Perhaps even the most
important part. A portion of wisdom lies in knowing that. A portion
of courage lies in going on anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stretched his boots toward the fire. &ldquo;Did
Nynaeve tell you she and the others have been keeping company with
Cadsuane? They&rsquo;re on a ride with her right now.&rdquo; On the way
back from it, rather. He could feel Min drawing closer. She would
not be much longer. She was still excited about something, a
feeling that surged and fell as if she were trying to hold it
down.</p>

<p>Lan smiled, a rare event without Nynaeve present. It
did not reach his icy eyes, though. &ldquo;She forbade me to reveal it to
you, but since you already know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She and Min convinced Alivia
that if they could catch Cadsuane&rsquo;s interest themselves, they
might be able to bring her closer to you. They found out where she
is staying and asked her to teach them.&rdquo; The smile faded, leaving a
face carved from stone. &ldquo;My wife has made a sacrifice for you,
sheepherder,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;I hope you remember that. She will
not say much, but I believe Cadsuane treats her as if she were
still one of the Accepted, or maybe a novice. You know how hard
that would be for Nynaeve to bear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cadsuane treats everyone as if they were novices,&rdquo;
Rand muttered. Uppity? Light, how was he to deal with the woman?
And yet he had to find a way. They sat in silence, staring at the
fire until steam began to rise from their out-thrust bootsoles.</p>

<p>The bond gave him warning, and he looked around just
as Nynaeve appeared through the door to the stableyard, and then
Min and Alivia, shaking the rain off their cloaks and adjusting
their divided skirts and grimacing at damp spots as if they had
expected to go riding in this weather without getting damp. As
usual, Nynaeve was wearing her jeweled <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>,
belt and necklace, bracelets and rings, and the odd
bracelet-and-rings <em>angreal</em>.</p>

<p>Still neatening herself, Min looked at Rand and
smiled, not at all surprised to see him there, of course. Warmth
flowed from her along the bond like a caress, though she was still
trying to suppress her excitement. The other two women took longer
to notice Lan and him, but when they did, they handed their cloaks
to one of the serving men to be taken up to their rooms and joined
the two men at the fireplace, holding out their hands to the
warmth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you enjoy your ride in the rain with Cadsuane?&rdquo;
Rand asked, raising his cup to take a mouthful of the sweet wine.
Min&rsquo;s head jerked toward him, and a flash of guilt stabbed
along the bond, but the expression on her face was purest
indignation. He almost choked in swallowing. How was her meeting
Cadsuane behind his back <em>his</em> fault? &ldquo;Stop glaring at Lan,
Nynaeve,&rdquo; he said when he could talk. &ldquo;Verin told me.&rdquo; Nynaeve
shifted her dark glower to him, and he shook his head. He had heard
women say that it, whatever &ldquo;it&rdquo; was, was always a man&rsquo;s
fault, but sometimes women really seemed to believe it! &ldquo;I
apologize for whatever you&rsquo;ve gone through with her on my
behalf,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;but you won&rsquo;t need to any longer. I
asked her to be my advisor. Or rather, I asked Verin to tell her I
want to ask. Tonight. With any luck, she will leave with us
tomorrow.&rdquo; He expected exclamations of surprised relief, but that
was not what he got.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A remarkable woman, Cadsuane,&rdquo; Alivia said, patting
her white-threaded golden hair into place. Her husky drawl sounded
impressed. &ldquo;A strict taskmistress, she can teach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes you can see the forest, woolhead, if
you&rsquo;re led to it by the nose,&rdquo; Min said, folding her arms
under her breasts. The bond carried approval, but he did not think
it was for deciding to give up on finding the renegades. &ldquo;Remember
she wants an apology for Cairhien. Think of her as your aunt, the
one who won&rsquo;t put up with any nonsense, and you will do all
right with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cadsuane is not as bad as she seems.&rdquo; Nynaeve
frowned at the other two women, and her hand twitched toward the
braid drawn over her shoulder, though all they had done was look at
her. &ldquo;Well, she isn&rsquo;t! We will work out our&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;differences&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;in time. That&rsquo;s all it will take. A little time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand exchanged glances with Lan, who shrugged
slightly and took another drink. Rand exhaled slowly. Nynaeve had
differences with Cadsuane she could work out with time, Min saw a
strict aunt in the woman, and Alivia a strict teacher. The first
would cause sparks to fly until it was worked out, if he knew
Nynaeve, and the last two he did not want. But he was stuck with
them. He took another swallow of wine himself.</p>

<p>The men at the tables were not near enough to
overhear unless she spoke loudly, but Nynaeve lowered her voice and
leaned toward Rand. &ldquo;Cadsuane showed me what two of my <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em> do,&rdquo; she whispered, a glow of excitement in
her eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager those ornaments she wears are <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, too. She recognized mine as soon as she
touched them.&rdquo; Smiling, Nynaeve thumbed one of the three rings on
her right hand, the one with a pale green stone. &ldquo;I knew this would
detect someone channeling <em>saidar</em> as much as three miles
away, if I set it, but she says it will detect <em>saidin</em>,
too. She seemed to think it should tell me what direction they
were, as well, but we could not see how.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turning from the fireplace, Alivia sniffed loudly,
but she also lowered her voice to say, &ldquo;And you were satisfied when
she could not. I saw it on your face. How can you be satisfied with
not knowing, with ignorance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just with <em>her</em> not knowing everything,&rdquo;
Nynaeve muttered, glowering over her shoulder at the taller woman,
but an instant later her smile returned. &ldquo;The most important thing,
Rand, is this.&rdquo; Her hands settled on the slim jeweled belt around
her waist. &ldquo;She called it a &lsquo;Well.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; He gave a start as
something brushed his face, and she giggled. Nynaeve actually
giggled! &ldquo;It <em>is</em> a well,&rdquo; she laughed behind fingers
pressed over her mouth, &ldquo;or a barrel, anyway. And full of <em>
saidar</em>. Not very much, but all I have to do to refill it is
embrace <em>saidar</em> through it as if it was an <em>
angreal</em>. Isn&rsquo;t that wonderful?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonderful,&rdquo; he said without much enthusiasm. So
Cadsuane was walking around with <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> in her
hair, was she, and very likely one of these &ldquo;wells&rdquo; among them, or
she would not have recognized it. Light, he thought no one had <em>
ever</em> found two <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> that did the same
thing. Meeting her tonight would have been bad enough without
knowing she would be able to channel, even here.</p>

<p>He was about to ask Min to come with him, when
Mistress Keene bustled up, the white bun on top of her head drawn
so tight it seemed she was trying to pull the skin off of her face.
She cast a suspicious, disapproving look over Rand and Lan and
pursed her lips as if considering what they had done wrong. He had
seen her give the same look to the merchants who stayed at the inn.
The men, anyway. If the accommodations had not been so comfortable
and the food so good, she might not have had any custom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This was delivered for your husband this morning,
Mistress Farshaw,&rdquo; she said, handing Min a letter sealed with an
untidy blob of red wax. The innkeeper&rsquo;s pointed chin rose.
&ldquo;And a woman was inquiring after him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Verin,&rdquo; Rand said quickly, to forestall questions
and get rid of the woman. Who knew to send him a letter here?
Cadsuane? One of the Asha&rsquo;man with her? Maybe one of the other
sisters? He frowned at the folded square of paper in Min&rsquo;s
hand, impatient for the innkeeper to leave.</p>

<p>Min&rsquo;s lips twitched, and she avoided looking at
him so hard that he knew he caused the smile. Her amusement
trickled through the bond. &ldquo;Thank you, Mistress Keene. Verin is a
friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That sharp chin rose higher. &ldquo;If you ask me, Mistress
Farshaw, when you have a pretty husband, you need to watch your
friends, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Watching the woman march back to the red arch,
Min&rsquo;s eyes sparkled with the mirth that flowed along the bond,
and her mouth struggled against laughing. Instead of handing the
message to Rand, she broke the seal with her thumb and unfolded the
letter herself, for all the world as if she were a native of this
mad city.</p>

<p>She frowned slightly as she read, but a brief flare
in the bond was the only warning he had. Crumpling the letter, she
turned toward the fireplace; he bounded from the bench to snatch it
from her hand just before she could toss it into the flames.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool,&rdquo; she said, catching his wrist.
She stared up at him, her large dark eyes deadly serious. All that
came to him through the bond was a grim intensity. &ldquo;Please
don&rsquo;t be a fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promised Verin I&rsquo;d try not,&rdquo; he said, but Min
did not smile.</p>

<p>He smoothed out the page on his chest. The writing
was in a spidery hand he did not recognize, and there was no
signature.</p>

<p class="note">I know who you are, and I wish you well, but I also
wish you gone from Far Madding. The Dragon Reborn leaves death and
destruction where he steps. I now know why you are here, too. You
killed Rochaid, and Kisman also is dead. Torval and Gedwyn have
taken the top floor above a bootmaker named Zeram on Blue Carp
Street, just above the Illian Gate. Kill them and go, and leave Far
Madding in peace.</p>

<p>The clock in the Women&rsquo;s Room rang the hour.
Hours of daylight remained before he had to meet Cadsuane.</p>
