<h4><em>In Need of a Bellfounder</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
boxlike wagon reminded Mat of Tinker wagons he
had seen, a little house on wheels, though this one, filled with
cabinets and workbenches built into the walls, was not made for a
dwelling. Wrinkling his nose at the odd, acrid smells that filled
the interior, he shifted uncomfortably on his three-legged stool,
the only place for anyone to sit. His broken leg and ribs were near
enough healed, and the cuts that he had suffered when that whole
bloody building fell on his head, but the injuries still pained him
now and then. Besides, he was hoping for sympathy. Women loved to
show sympathy, if you played it out right. He made himself stop
twisting his long signet ring on his finger. Let a woman know you
were nervous, and she put her own construction on it, and sympathy
went right out the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, Aludra,&rdquo; he said, assuming his most winning
smile, &ldquo;by this time you must know the Seanchan won&rsquo;t look
twice at fireworks. Those <em>damane</em> do something called Sky
Lights that makes your best fireworks look like a few sparks flying
up the chimney, so I hear. No offense meant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me, I have not seen these so-called Sky Lights
myself,&rdquo; she replied dismissively in her strong Taraboner accent.
Her head was bent over a wooden mortar the size of a large keg on
one of the workbenches, and despite a wide blue ribbon gathering
her dark waist-length hair loosely at the nape of her neck, it fell
forward to hide her face. The long white apron with its dark
smudges did nothing to conceal how well her dark green dress fit
over her hips, but he was more interested in what she was doing.
Well, as interested. She was grinding at a coarse black powder with
a wooden pestle nearly as long as her arm. The powder looked a
little like what he had seen inside fireworks he had cut open, but
he still did not know what went into it. &ldquo;In any event,&rdquo; she went
on, unaware of his scrutiny, &ldquo;I will not give you the Guild
secrets. You must understand this, yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat winced. He had been working on her for days to
bring her to this point, ever since a chance visit to Valan
Luca&rsquo;s traveling show revealed that she was here in Ebou Dar,
and all the while he had dreaded that she would mention the
Illuminators&rsquo; Guild. &ldquo;But you aren&rsquo;t an Illuminator
anymore, remember? They kicked&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;you said you left the
Guild.&rdquo; Not for the first time he considered a small reminder that
he had once saved her from four Guild members who wanted to cut her
throat. That sort of thing was enough to make most women fall on
your neck with kisses and offers of whatever you wanted. But there
had been a notable lack of kisses when he actually saved her, so it
was unlikely she would begin now. &ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; he went on airily, &ldquo;you
don&rsquo;t have to worry about the Guild. You&rsquo;ve been making
nightflowers for how long? And nobody has come around trying to
stop you. Why, I&rsquo;ll wager you never see another
Illuminator.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you heard?&rdquo; she asked quietly, her head
still down. The pestle&rsquo;s rotation slowed almost to a stop.
&ldquo;Tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hair on his scalp nearly stood on end. How did
women do that? Hide every clue, and they still went straight to
what you wanted to conceal. &ldquo;What do you mean? I hear the same
gossip you do, I suppose. Mostly about the Seanchan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She spun around so fast that her hair swung like a
flail, and snatched the heavy pestle up in both hands, brandishing
it overhead. Perhaps ten years or so older than he, she had large
dark eyes and a small plump mouth that usually seemed ready to be
kissed. He had thought about kissing her a time or two. Most women
were more amenable after a few kisses. Now, her teeth were bared,
and she looked ready to bite off his nose. &ldquo;Tell me!&rdquo; she
commanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was playing at dice with some Seanchan down near
the docks,&rdquo; he said reluctantly, keeping a careful eye on the
upraised pestle. A man might bluff and bluster and walk away if the
matter was not serious, but a woman could crack your skull on a
whim. And his hip was aching and stiff from sitting too long. He
was not sure how quickly he could move from the stool. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t want to be the one to tell you, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The Guild
doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore, Aludra. The chapter house in Tanchico
is gone.&rdquo; That had been the only real chapter house in the Guild.
The one in Cairhien was long abandoned now, and for the rest,
Illuminators only traveled to put on displays for rulers and
nobles. &ldquo;They refused to let Seanchan soldiers inside the compound,
and fought, tried to, when they broke in anyway. I don&rsquo;t know
what happened&mdash;maybe a soldier took a lantern where he
shouldn&rsquo;t have&mdash;but half the compound exploded, as I
understand it. Probably exaggeration. But the Seanchan believed one
of the Illuminators used the One Power, and they&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He sighed,
and tried to make his voice gentle. Blood and ashes, he did not
want to tell her this! But she was glaring at him, that bloody club
poised to split his scalp. &ldquo;Aludra, the Seanchan gathered up
everyone left alive at the chapter house, and some Illuminators
that had gone to Amador, and everybody in between who even looked
like an Illuminator, and they made them all <em>
da&rsquo;covale</em>. That means&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what it means!&rdquo; she said fiercely. Swinging
back to the big mortar, she began pounding away with the pestle so
hard that he was afraid the thing might explode, if that powder
really was what went inside fireworks. &ldquo;Fools!&rdquo; she muttered
angrily, thumping the pestle loudly in the mortar. &ldquo;Great blind
fools! With the mighty, you must bend your neck a little and walk
on, but they would not see it!&rdquo; Sniffing, she scrubbed at her
cheeks with the back of her hand. &ldquo;You are wrong, my young friend.
So long as one Illuminator lives, the Guild, it lives too, and me,
I still live!&rdquo; Still not looking at him, she wiped her cheeks with
her hand again. &ldquo;And what would you do if I gave you the fireworks?
Hurl them at the Seanchan from the catapult, I suppose?&rdquo; Her snort
told what she thought of that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s wrong with the idea?&rdquo; he asked
defensively. A good field catapult, a scorpion, could throw a
ten-pound stone five hundred paces, and ten pounds of fireworks
would do more damage than any stone. &ldquo;Anyway, I have a better idea.
I saw those tubes you use to toss nightflowers into the sky. Three
hundred paces or more, you said. Tip one on its side more or less,
and I&rsquo;ll bet it could toss a nightflower a <em>thousand</em>
paces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peering into the mortar, she muttered almost under
her breath. &ldquo;Me, I talk too much,&rdquo; he thought it was, and something
about pretty eyes that made no sense. He hurried on to stop her
from starting up about Guild secrets again. &ldquo;Those tubes are a lot
smaller than a catapult, Aludra. If they were well hidden, the
Seanchan would never know where they came from. You could think of
it as paying them back for the chapter house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turning her head, she gave him a look of respect.
Mingled with surprise, but he managed to ignore that. Her eyes were
red-rimmed, and there were tearstains on her cheeks. Maybe if he
put an arm around her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Women usually appreciated a little
comforting when they cried.</p>

<p>Before he could even shift his weight, she swung the
pestle between them, pointing it at him like a sword with one hand.
Those slender arms must be stronger than they looked; the wooden
club never wavered. <em>Light</em>, he thought, <em>she</em>
couldn&rsquo;t <em>have known what I was going to do!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;This is not bad, for one who only saw the lofting
tubes a few days ago,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but me, I have thought about this
long before you. I had reason.&rdquo; For a moment, her voice was bitter,
but it smoothed out again, and became a little amused. &ldquo;I will set
you the puzzle, since you are so clever, no?&rdquo; she said, arching an
eyebrow. Oh, she definitely was amused by something! &ldquo;You tell me
what use I might have for a bellfounder, and I will tell you <em>
all</em> of my secrets. Even the ones that will make you blush,
yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, that did sound interesting. But the fireworks
were more important than an hour snuggling with her. What secrets
did she have that could make him blush? He might surprise her,
there. Not all of those other men&rsquo;s memories that had been
stuffed into his head had to do with battles. &ldquo;A bellmaker,&rdquo; he
mused, without a notion of where to go from there. None of those
old memories gave even a hint. &ldquo;Well, I suppose&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;A bellmaker
could&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Maybe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, suddenly brisk. &ldquo;You will go, and
return in two or three days. I have the work to do, and you are too
distracting with all of your questions and wheedling. No; no
arguments! You will go now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Glowering, he rose and clapped his wide-brimmed black
hat onto his head. Wheedling? Wheedling! Blood and bloody ashes! He
had dropped his cloak in a heap by the door on entering, and he
grunted softly, bending to pick it up. He had been sitting on that
stool most of the day. But maybe he had made a little headway with
her. If he could solve her puzzle, anyway. Alarm bells. Gongs to
sound the hour. It made no sense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might think of kissing such a smart young man as
you if you did not belong to another,&rdquo; she murmured in decidedly
warm tones. &ldquo;You have such a pretty bottom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He jerked erect, keeping his back to her. The heat in
his face was pure outrage, but she was sure to say he was blushing.
He could usually manage to forget what he was wearing unless
someone brought it up. There had been an incident or three in
taverns. While he was flat on his back with his leg in splints and
his ribs strapped and bandages just about everywhere else, Tylin
had hidden all of his clothes. He had not found where, yet, but
surely they were hidden, not burned. After all, she could not mean
to hold on to him forever. All that remained of his own were his
hat and the black silk scarf tied around his neck. And the silvery
foxhead medallion, of course, hanging on a leather cord under his
shirt. And his knives; he really would have felt lost without
those. When he finally managed to crawl out of that bloody bed, the
bloody woman had had new clothes made for him, with her sitting
there watching the bloody seamstresses measure and fit him! Snowy
lace at his wrists almost hid his bloody hands unless he was
careful, and more spilled from his neck almost to his flaming
waist. Tylin liked lace on a man. His cloak was a brilliant
scarlet, as red as his too-tight breeches, and edged with golden
scrollwork and white roses, of all bloody things. Not to mention a
white oval on his left shoulder with House Mitsobar&rsquo;s green
Sword and Anchor. His coat was blue enough for a Tinker, worked in
red and gold Tairen mazes across the chest and down the sleeves for
good measure. He did not like recalling what he had been forced to
go through to convince Tylin to leave off the pearls and sapphires
and the Light alone knew what else she had wanted. And it was
short, to boot. Indecently short! Tylin liked his bloody bottom,
too, and she did not seem to mind who saw it!</p>

<p>Settling the cloak around his shoulders&mdash;it was
some covering, at least&mdash;he grabbed his shoulder-high walking
staff from where it was leaning beside the door. His hip and leg
were going to ache until he could walk the pain away. &ldquo;In two or
three days, then,&rdquo; he said with as much dignity as he could
muster.</p>

<p>Aludra laughed softly. Not softly enough that he
could not hear, though. Light, but a woman could do more with a
laugh than a dockside bullyboy with a string of curses! And just as
deliberately.</p>

<p>Limping out of the wagon, he slammed the door behind
him as soon as he was far enough down the wooden steps that were
fastened to the wagon bed. The afternoon sky was just like the
morning sky had been, gray and blustery, thatched with sullen
clouds. A sharp wind gusted fitfully. Altara had no true winter,
but what it did have was enough to be going on with. Rather than
snow, there were icy rains and thunderstorms racing in off the sea,
and in between it was damp enough to make the cold seem harder. The
ground had a sodden feel under your boots even when it was dry.
Scowling, he hobbled away from the wagon.</p>

<p>Women! Aludra was pretty, though. And she did know
how to make fireworks. A bellfounder? Maybe he could make it a
short two days. So long as Aludra did not start chasing <em>
him</em>. A good many women seemed to be doing that, of late. Had
Tylin changed something about him, to make women pursue him the way
she herself did? No. That was ridiculous. The wind caught his
cloak, flaring it behind him, but he was too absorbed to master it.
A pair of slender women&mdash;acrobats, he thought&mdash;gave him
sly smiles as they passed, and he smiled and made his best leg.
Tylin had not changed him. He was still the same man he had always
been.</p>

<p>Luca&rsquo;s show was fifty times as large as what
Thom had told him about, maybe more, a sprawling hodgepodge of
tents and wagons the size of a large village. Despite the weather,
a number of performers were practicing where he could see them. A
woman in a flowing white blouse and breeches as tight as his swung
back and forth on a sagging rope slung between two tall poles, then
threw herself off and somehow caught her feet in the rope just
before she hurtled to the ground below. Then she twisted to catch
the rope with her hands, pulled herself back to her seat and began
the same thing again. Not far off, a fellow was running on top of
an egg-shaped wheel that must have been a good twenty feet long,
mounted on a platform that put him higher above the ground when he
dashed across the narrow end than the woman who was going to break
her fool neck soon. Mat eyed a bare-chested man who was rolling
three shiny balls along his arms and across his shoulders without
ever touching them with his hands. That was interesting. He might
be able to manage that himself. At least those balls would not
leave you bleeding and broken. He had had enough of that to suit
him a lifetime.</p>

<p>What really caught his eyes, however, were the
horselines. Long horselines, where two dozen men bundled against
the cold were shoveling dung into barrows. Hundreds of horses.
Supposedly, Luca had given shelter to some Seanchan animal trainer,
and his reward had been a warrant, signed by the High Lady Suroth
herself, allowing him to keep all of his animals. Mat&rsquo;s own
Pips was secure, saved from the lottery ordered by Suroth because
he was in the Tarasin Palace stables, but getting the gelding out
of those stables was beyond him. Tylin as good as had a leash
around his neck, and she did not intend to let him go any time
soon.</p>

<p>Turning away, he considered having Vanin steal some
of the show&rsquo;s horses if the talks with Luca went badly. From
what Mat knew of Vanin, it would be an evening stroll for the
unlikely man. Fat as he was, Vanin could steal, and ride, any horse
ever foaled. Unfortunately, Mat doubted he himself could sit a
saddle for more than a mile. Still, it was something to consider.
He was growing desperate.</p>

<p>Limping along, idly eyeing tumblers and jugglers and
acrobats at their practice, he wondered how matters had come to
this pass. Blood and ashes! He was <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>! He was
supposed to shape the world around him! But here he was, stuck in
Ebou Dar, Tylin&rsquo;s pet and toy&mdash;the woman had not even
let him heal completely before leaping on him again like a duck on
a beetle!&mdash;while everyone else was having a fine time of it.
With those Kinswomen fawning at her heels, likely Nynaeve was
lording it over everyone in sight. Once Egwene realized those stark
raving mad Aes Sedai who had named her Amyrlin did not really mean
it, Talmanes and the Band of the Red Hand were ready to spirit her
away. Light, Elayne might be wearing the Rose Crown by now, if he
knew her! Rand and Perrin probably were lolling in front of a fire
in some palace, swilling wine and telling jokes.</p>

<p>He grimaced and rubbed at his forehead as a faint
rush of colors seemed to swirl inside his head. That happened
lately whenever he thought about either man. He did not know why,
and he did not want to know. He just wanted it to stop. If only he
could get away from Ebou Dar. And take the secret of fireworks with
him, of course, but he would take escape over the secret any
day.</p>

<p>Thom and Beslan were still where he had left them,
drinking with Luca in front of Luca&rsquo;s elaborately decorated
wagon, but he did not join them immediately. For some reason, Luca
had taken an instant dislike to Mat Cauthon. Mat returned the
favor, but with reason. Luca had a smug, self-satisfied face, and a
way of smirking at any woman in sight. And he seemed to think every
woman in the world enjoyed looking at him. Light, the man was
married!</p>

<p>Sprawled in a gilded chair he must have stolen from a
palace, Luca was laughing and making expansive, lordly gestures to
Thom and Beslan, seated on benches to either side of him. Golden
stars and comets covered Luca&rsquo;s brilliant red coat and cloak.
A <em>Tinker</em> would have blushed! His wagon would have made a
Tinker weep! Much larger than Aludra&rsquo;s work-wagon, the thing
appeared to have been <em>lacquered</em>! The phases of the moon
repeated themselves in silver all the way around the wagon, and
golden stars and comets in every size covered the rest of the
red-and-blue surface. In that setting, Beslan looked almost
ordinary in a coat and cloak worked in swooping birds. Thom,
knuckling wine from his long white mustaches, seemed positively
drab in plain bronze-colored wool and a dark cloak.</p>

<p>One person who should have been there was not, but a
quick glance around found a cluster of women at a nearby wagon.
They were every age from his own up to graying hair, but every one
of them was giggling at what they surrounded. Sighing, Mat made his
way there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I just cannot decide,&rdquo; came a boy&rsquo;s piping
voice from the center of the women. &ldquo;When I look at you, Merici,
your eyes are the prettiest I have ever seen. But when I look at
you, Neilyn, yours are. Your lips are ripe cherries, Gillin, and
yours make me want to kiss them, Adria. And your neck, Jameine,
graceful as a swan&rsquo;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Swallowing an oath, Mat quickened his pace as much as
he could and pushed through the women muttering apologies left and
right. Olver was in the middle of them, a short, pale boy posturing
and grinning at one woman then another. That toothy grin alone was
enough that any of them might decide to slap his ears off in a
moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please forgive him,&rdquo; Mat murmured, taking the
boy&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Come on, Olver; we have to get back to the city.
Stop waving your cloak about. He doesn&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s
saying, really. I don&rsquo;t know where he picks up that sort of
thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Luckily, the women laughed and ruffled Olver&rsquo;s
hair as Mat led him away. Some murmured that he was a sweet boy, of
all things! One slipped her hand under Mat&rsquo;s cloak and pinched
his bottom. Women!</p>

<p>Once clear, he scowled at the boy tripping along
happily at his side. Olver had grown since Mat first met him, but
he was still short for his years. And with that wide mouth and ears
to match, he would never be handsome. &ldquo;You could get yourself in
deep trouble talking to women that way,&rdquo; Mat told him. &ldquo;Women like
a man to be quiet, and well-mannered. And reserved. Reserved, and
maybe a little shy. Cultivate those qualities, and you&rsquo;ll do
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olver gave him a gaping, incredulous stare, and Mat
sighed. The lad had a fistful of uncles looking after him, and
every one except Mat himself was a bad influence.</p>

<p>Thom and Beslan were enough to restore Olver&rsquo;s
grin. Pulling his hand free, he ran ahead to them laughing. Thom
was teaching him how to juggle and play the harp and the flute, and
Beslan was teaching him how to use a sword. His other &ldquo;uncles&rdquo; gave
him other lessons, in a remarkably varied set of skills. Mat
intended to start teaching him to use a quarterstaff, and the Two
Rivers bow, once he had his strength back. What the boy was
learning from Chel Vanin, or the Redarms, Mat did not want to
know.</p>

<p>Luca rose from his fancy chair at Mat&rsquo;s
approach, his fatuous smile fading to a sour grimace. Eyeing Mat up
and down, he swept that ridiculous cloak around himself with a wide
flourish and announced in a booming voice, &ldquo;I am a busy man. I have
much to do. It may be that I soon will have the honor of guesting
the High Lady Suroth for a private showing.&rdquo; Without another word
he strode away holding the ornate cloak with just one hand, so
gusts rippled it behind him like a banner.</p>

<p>Mat gathered his own with both hands. A cloak was for
warmth. He had seen Suroth in the Palace, though never closely. As
closely as he wanted, though. He could not imagine her giving a
moment to Valan Luca&rsquo;s Grand Traveling Show and Magnificent
Display of Marvels and Wonders, as the streamer strung between two
tall poles at the entrance to the show announced in red letters a
pace high. If she did, likely she would eat the lions. Or frighten
them to death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has he agreed yet, Thom?&rdquo; he asked quietly, frowning
after Luca.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can travel with him when he leaves Ebou Dar,&rdquo; the
weathered man replied. &ldquo;For a price.&rdquo; He snorted, blowing out his
mustaches, and irritably raked a hand through his white hair. &ldquo;We
should eat and sleep like kings for what he wants, but knowing him,
I doubt we will. He doesn&rsquo;t think we are criminals, since
we&rsquo;re still walking free, but he knows we&rsquo;re running from
something, or we would travel some other way. Unfortunately, he
does not intend to leave until spring at the earliest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat considered several choice curses. Not until
spring. The Light knew what Tylin would have done to him, would
have him doing, by spring. Maybe Vanin stealing horses was not such
a bad notion. &ldquo;Gives me more time for dice,&rdquo; he said, as if it did
not matter. &ldquo;If he wants as much as you say, I need to fatten my
purse. One thing you can say for the Seanchan, they don&rsquo;t seem
to mind losing.&rdquo; He tried to be careful how long he let his luck
run, and he had not faced any threats of having his throat slit for
cheating, at least since he had been able to leave the Palace on
his own feet. At first, he had believed it was his luck spreading,
or perhaps being <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> finally coming in for
something useful.</p>

<p>Beslan regarded him gravely. A dark slender man a
little younger than Mat, he had been blithely rakish when Mat first
met him, always ready for a round of the taverns, especially if it
ended with women or a fight. Since the Seanchan came, he had grown
more serious, though. To him, they were very serious business. &ldquo;My
mother won&rsquo;t be pleased if she learns I am helping her pretty
leave Ebou Dar, Mat. She will marry me to someone with a squint and
a mustache like a Taraboner foot soldier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After all this time, Mat still winced. He could never
get used to Tylin&rsquo;s son thinking what his mother was doing
with Mat was all right. Well, Beslan did believe she had become a
little too possessive&mdash;just a little, mind!&mdash;but that
was the only reason he was willing to help. Beslan claimed Mat was
what his mother needed to take her mind off the agreements she had
been forced into by the Seanchan! Sometimes, Mat wished he was back
in the Two Rivers, where at least you knew how other people
thought. Sometimes he did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can we return to the Palace now?&rdquo; Olver said, more a
demand than a question. &ldquo;I have a reading lesson with the Lady
Riselle. She lets me rest my head on her bosom while she reads to
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A notable achievement, Olver,&rdquo; Thom said, stroking
his mustaches to hide a smile. Leaning closer to the other two men,
he pitched his voice to escape the boy&rsquo;s ears. &ldquo;The woman
makes me play the harp for her before she lets me rest my head on
that magnificent pillow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Riselle makes everyone entertain her first,&rdquo; Beslan
chuckled in a knowing way, and Thom stared at him in
astonishment.</p>

<p>Mat groaned. It was not his leg, this time, or the
fact that every man in Ebou Dar seemed to be choosing the bosom
they rested their heads on except for Mat Cauthon. Those bloody
dice had just started tumbling in his head again. Something bad was
coming his way. Something very bad.</p>
