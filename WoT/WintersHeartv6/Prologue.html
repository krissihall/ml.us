<h4><em>Snow</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>hree
lanterns cast a flickering light, more than
enough to illuminate the small room with its stark white walls and
ceiling, but Seaine kept her eyes fixed on the heavy wooden door.
Illogical, she knew; foolish in a Sitter for the White. The weave
of <em>saidar</em> she had pushed around the jamb brought her
occasional whispers of distant footsteps in the warren of hallways
outside, whispers that faded away almost as soon as heard. A simple
thing learned from a friend in her long-ago novice days, but she
would have warning long before anyone came near. Few people came
down as deep as the second basement, anyway.</p>

<p>Her weave picked up the far-off chittering of rats.
Light! How long since there had been rats in Tar Valon, in the
Tower itself? Were any of them spies for the Dark One? She wet her
lips uneasily. Logic counted for nothing in this. True. If
illogical. She wanted to laugh. With an effort she crept back from
the brink of hysteria. Think of something besides rats. Something
besides&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;A muffled squeal rose in the room behind her,
faltered into muted whimpering. She tried to stop up her ears.
Concentrate!</p>

<p>In a way, she and her companions had been led to this
room because the heads of the Ajahs seemed to be meeting in secret.
She herself had glimpsed Ferane Neheran whispering in a secluded
nook of the library with Jesse Bilal, who stood very high among the
Browns if not at the very top. She thought she stood on firmer
ground with Suana Dragand, of the Yellows. She thought so. But why
had Ferane gone walking with Suana in a secluded part of the Tower
grounds, both swathed in plain cloaks? Sitters of different Ajahs
still talked to one another openly, if coldly. The others had seen
similar things; they would not give names from their own Ajahs, of
course, but two had mentioned Ferane. A troubling puzzle. The Tower
was a seething swamp these days, every Ajah at every other
Ajah&rsquo;s throat, yet the heads met in corners. No one outside an
Ajah knew for certain who within it led, but apparently the leaders
knew each other. What <em>could</em> they be up to? What? It was
unfortunate that she could not simply ask Ferane, but even had
Ferane been tolerant of anyone&rsquo;s questions, she did not dare.
Not now.</p>

<p>Concentrate as she would, Seaine could not keep her
mind on the question. She knew she was staring at the door and
worrying at puzzles she could not solve just to avoid looking over
her shoulder. Toward the source of those stifled whimpers and
snuffling groans.</p>

<p>As if thinking of the sounds compelled her, she
looked back slowly to her companions, her breath growing more
uneven as her head moved by inches. Snow was falling heavily on Tar
Valon, far overhead, but the room seemed unaccountably hot. She
made herself <em>see</em>!</p>

<p>Brown-fringed shawl looped on her elbows, Saerin
stood with her feet planted apart, fingering the hilt of the curved
Altaran dagger thrust behind her belt. Cold anger darkened her
olive complexion enough to make the scar along her jaw stand out in
a pale line. Pevara appeared calmer, at first glance, yet one hand
gripped her red-embroidered skirts tightly and the other held the
smooth white cylinder of the Oath Rod like a foot-long club she was
ready to use. She might be ready; Pevara was far tougher than her
plump exterior suggested, and determined enough to make Saerin seem
a shirker.</p>

<p>On the other side of the Chair of Remorse, tiny
Yukiri had her arms rapped tightly around herself; the long
silvery-grey fringe on her shawl trembled with her shivers. Licking
her lips, Yukiri cast a worried glance at the woman standing beside
her. Doesine, looking more like a pretty boy than a Yellow sister
of considerable repute, displayed no reaction to what they were
doing. She was the one actually manipulating the weaves that
stretched into the Chair, and she stared at the
<em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, focusing so hard on her work that
perspiration beaded on her pale forehead. They were all Sitters,
including the tall woman writhing on the Chair.</p>

<p>Sweat drenched Talene, matting her golden hair,
soaking her linen shift till it clung to her. The rest of her
clothes made a jumbled pile in the corner. Her closed eyelids
fluttered, and she let out a constant stream of strangled moans and
mewling, half-uttered pleas. Seaine felt ill, but could not drag
her eyes away. Talene was a friend. Had been a friend.</p>

<p>Despite its name, the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>
looked nothing like a chair, just a large rectangular block of
marbled gray. No one knew what it was made of, but the material was
hard as steel everywhere except the slanted top. The statuesque
Green sank a little into that, and somehow it molded itself to her
no matter how she twisted. Doesine&rsquo;s weavings flowed into the
only break anywhere in the Chair, a palm-sized rectangular hole in
one side with tiny notches spaced unevenly around it. Criminals
caught in Tar Valon were brought down here to experience the Chair
of Remorse, to experience carefully selected consequences of their
crimes. On release, they invariably fled the island. There was very
little crime in Tar Valon. Queasily, Seaine wondered whether this
was anything like the use the Chair had been put to in the Age of
Legends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is she&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;seeing?&rdquo; Her question came out a
whisper in spite of herself. Talene would be more than seeing; to
her, it all would seem real. Thank the light she had no Warder,
almost unheard of for a Green. She had claimed a Sitter had no need
for one. Different reasons came to mind, now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is bloody being flogged by bloody Trollocs,&rdquo;
Doesine said hoarsely. Touches of her native Cairhien had appeared
in her voice, something that seldom happened except under stress.
&ldquo;When they are done&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She can see the Trolloc&rsquo;s cook
kettle boiling over the fire, and a Myrddraal watching her. She
must know it will be one or the other next. Burn me, if she
doesn&rsquo;t break this time&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Doesine brushed perspiration
from her forehead irritably and drew a ragged breath. &ldquo;Stop
joggling my elbow. It has been a long while since I did this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three times under,&rdquo; Yukiri muttered. &ldquo;The toughest
strongarm is broken by his own guilt, if nothing else, after two!
What if she&rsquo;s innocent? Light, this is like stealing sheep
with the shepherd watching!&rdquo; Even shaking, she managed to appear
regal, but she always sounded like what she had been, a village
woman. She glared around at the rest of them in a sickly fashion.
&ldquo;The law forbids using the Chair on initiates. We&rsquo;ll all be
unchaired! And if being thrown out of the hall isn&rsquo;t enough,
we&rsquo;ll probably be exiled. And birched before we go, just to
drop salt in our tea! Burn me, if we&rsquo;re wrong, we could all be
stilled!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seaine shuddered. They would escape that last, if
their suspicions proved right. No, not suspicions, certainties.
They had to be right! But even if they were, Yukiri was correct
about the rest. Tower law seldom allowed for necessity, or any
supposed higher good. If they were right, though, the price was
worth paying. Please, the Light send they were right!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you blind and deaf?&rdquo; Pevara snapped, shaking the
Oath Rod at Yukiri. &ldquo;She refused to reswear the Oath against
speaking an untrue word, and it had to be more than stupid Green
Ajah pride after we&rsquo;d all done as much already. When I
shielded her, she tried to <em>stab</em> me! Does <em>that</em>
shout innocence? Does it? For all she knew, we just meant to talk
at her until our tongues dried up! What reason would she have to
expect more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you both,&rdquo; Saerin put in dryly, &ldquo;for stating
the obvious. It&rsquo;s too late to go back, Yukiri, so we might as
well go forward. And if I were you, Pevara, I wouldn&rsquo;t be
shouting at one of the four women in the whole Tower I knew I could
trust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yukiri flushed and shifted her shawl, and Pevara
looked a trifle abashed. A trifle. They might all be Sitters, but
Saerin had most definitely taken charge. Seaine was unsure how she
felt about that. A few hours ago, she and Pevara had been two old
friends alone on a dangerous quest, equals reaching decisions
together; now they had allies. She should be grateful for more
companions. They were not in the Hall, though, and they could not
claim Sitter&rsquo;s rights on this. Tower hierarchies had taken
over, all the subtle and not-so-subtle distinctions as to who stood
where with respect to whom. In truth, Saerin had been both novice
and Accepted twice as long as most of them, but forty years as a
Sitter, longer than anyone else in the Hall, counted for a great
deal. Seaine would be lucky if Saerin asked her opinion, much less
her advice, before deciding anything at all. Foolish, yet the
knowledge pricked like a thorn in her foot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Trollocs are dragging her toward the kettle,&rdquo;
Doesine said suddenly, her voice grating. A thin keening escaped
thorough Talene&rsquo;s clenched teeth; she shook so hard she seemed
to vibrate. &ldquo;I&mdash;I do not know if I can&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;can flaming make
myself&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring her awake,&rdquo; Saerin commanded without so much
as glancing at anyone else to see what they thought. &ldquo;Stop sulking,
Yukiri, and be ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Gray gave her a proud, furious stare, but when
Doesine let her weaves fade and Talene&rsquo;s blue eyes fluttered
open, the glow of <em>saidar</em> surrounded Yukiri and she
shielded the woman lying on the Chair without uttering a word.
Saerin was in charge, and everyone knew it, and that was that. A
very sharp thorn.</p>

<p>A shield hardly seemed necessary. Her face a mask of
terror, Talene trembled and panted as though she had run ten miles
at top speed. She still sank into the soft surface, but without
Doesine channeling, it no longer formed itself to her. Talene
stared at the ceiling with bulging eyes, then squeezed them shut,
but they popped right open again. Whatever memories lay behind her
eyelids were nothing she wanted to face.</p>

<p>Covering the two strides to the Chair, Pevara thrust
the Oath Rod at the distraught woman. &ldquo;Forswear all oaths that bind
you and retake the Three Oaths, Talene,&rdquo; she said harshly. Talene
recoiled from the Rod as from a poisonous serpent, then jerked the
other way as Saerin bent over her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Next time, Talene, it&rsquo;s the cookpot for you. Or
the Myrddraal&rsquo;s tender attentions.&rdquo; Saerin&rsquo;s face was
implacable, but her tone made it seem soft by comparison. &ldquo;No
waking up before. And if that doesn&rsquo;t do, there&rsquo;ll be
another time, and another, as many as it takes if we must stay down
here until summer.&rdquo; Doesine opened her mouth in protest before
giving over with a grimace. Only she among them knew how to operate
the Chair, but in this group, she stood as low as Seaine.</p>

<p>Talene continued to stare up at Saerin. Tears filled
her big eyes, and she began to weep, great shuddering, hopeless
sobs. Blindly, she reached out, groping until Pevara stuck the Oath
Rod into her hand. Embracing the Source, Pevara channeled a thread
of Spirit to the Rod. Talene gripped the wrist-thick rod so hard
that her knuckles turned white, yet she just lay there sobbing.</p>

<p>Saerin straightened. &ldquo;I fear it&rsquo;s time to put
her back to sleep, Doesine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Talene&rsquo;s tears redoubled, but she mumbled
through them. &ldquo;I&mdash;forswear&mdash;all oaths&mdash;that bind
me.&rdquo; With the last word, she began to howl.</p>

<p>Seaine jumped, then swallowed hard. She personally
knew the pain of removing a single oath and had speculated on the
agony of removing more than one at once, but now the reality was in
front of her. Talene screamed till there was no breath left in her,
then pulled in air only to scream again, until Seaine half expected
people to come running down from the Tower itself. The tall Green
convulsed, flinging her arms and legs about, then suddenly arched
up till only her heels and head touched the gray surface, every
muscle clenched, her whole body spasming wildly.</p>

<p>As abruptly as the seizure had begun Talene collapsed
bonelessly and lay there weeping like a lost child. The Oath Rod
rolled from her limp hand down the sloping gray surface. Yukiri
murmured something with the sound of a fervent prayer. Doesine kept
whispering &ldquo;Light!&rdquo; over and over in a shaken voice. &ldquo;Light!
Light!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pevara scooped up the Rod and closed Talene&rsquo;s
fingers around it again. There was no mercy in Seaine&rsquo;s
friend, not in this matter. &ldquo;Now swear the Three Oaths,&rdquo; she
spat.</p>

<p>For an instant, it seemed Talene might refuse, but
slowly she repeated to oaths that made them all Aes Sedai and held
them together. To speak no word that was not true. Never to make a
weapon for one man to kill another. Never to use to One Power as a
weapon, except in defense of her life, or that of her Warder or
another sister. At the end, she began weeping in silence, shaking
without a sound. Perhaps it was the oaths tightening down on her.
They were uncomfortable when fresh. Perhaps.</p>

<p>Then Pevara told the other oath required of her.
Talene flinched, but muttered the words in tones of hopelessness.
&ldquo;I vow to obey all five of you absolutely.&rdquo; Otherwise, she only
stared straight ahead dully, tears trailing down her cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Answer me truthfully,&rdquo; Saerin told her. &ldquo;Are you of
the Black Ajah?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo; The words creaked, as if Talene&rsquo;s throat
were rusty.</p>

<p>The simple words froze Seaine in a way she had never
expected. She had set out to hunt the Black Ajah, after all, and
believed in her quarry as many sisters did not. She had laid hands
on another sister, on a Sitter, had helped bundle Talene along
deserted basement hallways wrapped in flows of Air, had broken a
dozen Tower laws, committed serious crimes, all to hear an answer
she had been nearly certain of before the question was asked. Now
she had heard. The Black Ajah really did exist. She was staring at
a Black sister, a Darkfriend who wore the shawl. And believing
turned out to be a pale shadow of confronting. Only her jaw
clenched near to cramping kept her teeth from chattering. She
struggled to compose herself, to think rationally. But nightmares
were awake and walking the Tower.</p>

<p>Someone exhaled heavily, and Seaine realized she was
not the only one who found her world turned upside down. Yukiri
gave herself a shake, then fixed her eyes on Talene as though
determined to hold the shield on her by willpower if need be.
Doesine was licking her lips, and smoothing her dark golden skirts
uncertainly. Only Saerin and Pevara appeared at ease.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Saerin said softly. Perhaps &ldquo;faintly&rdquo; was a
better word. &ldquo;So. Black Ajah.&rdquo; She drew a deep breath, and her tone
became brisk. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no more need for that, Yukiri. Talene,
you won&rsquo;t try to escape, or resist in any way. You won&rsquo;t
so much as touch the Source without permission from one of us.
Though I suppose someone else will take this forward once we hand
you over. Yukiri?&rdquo; The shield on Talene dissipated, but the glow
remained around Yukiri, as if she did not trust the effect of the
Rod on a Black sister.</p>

<p>Pevara frowned. &ldquo;Before we give her to Elaida,
Saerin, I want to dig out as much as we can. Names, places,
anything. Everything she knows!&rdquo; Darkfriends had killed
Pevara&rsquo;s entire family, and Seaine was sure she would go into
exile ready to hunt down every last Black sister personally.</p>

<p>Still huddled on the Chair, Talene made a sound, half
bitter laugh, half weeping. &ldquo;When you do that, we are all dead.
Dead! Elaida is Black Ajah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo; Seaine burst out. &ldquo;Elaida
gave me the order herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She must be,&rdquo; Doesine half whispered. &ldquo;Talene&rsquo;s
sworn the oaths again; she just named her!&rdquo; Yukiri nodded
vehemently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Use your heads,&rdquo; Pevara growled, shaking her own in
disgust. &ldquo;You know as well as I do if you believe a lie, you can
say it for truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that <em>is</em> truth,&rdquo; Saerin said firmly.
&ldquo;What proof do you have, Talene? Have you seen Elaida at your&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;meetings?&rdquo; She gripped her knife hilt so hard that her knuckles
paled. Saerin had had to fight harder than most for the shawl, for
the right to remain in the Tower at all. To her, the Tower was more
than home, more important than her own life. If Talene gave the
wrong answer, Elaida might not live to face trial.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t have meetings,&rdquo; Talene muttered
sullenly. &ldquo;Except the Supreme Council, I suppose. But she must be.
They know every report she receives, even the secret ones, every
word spoken to her. They know every decision she makes before
it&rsquo;s announced. Days before; sometimes weeks. How else, unless
she tells them?&rdquo; Sitting up with an effort, she tried to fix them
each in turn with an intent stare. It only made her eyes seem to
dart anxiously. &ldquo;We have to run; we have to find a place to hide.
I&rsquo;ll help you&mdash;tell you everything I know!&mdash;but
they&rsquo;ll kill us unless we run.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Strange, Seaine thought, how quickly Talene had made
her former cronies &ldquo;they&rdquo; and tried to identify herself with the
rest of them. No. She was avoiding the real problem, and avoidance
was witless. <em>Had</em> Elaida really set her to dig out the
Black Ajah? She had never once actually mentioned the name. Could
she have meant something else? Elaida had always jumped down the
throat of anyone who even mentioned the Black. Nearly any sister
would do the same, yet&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elaida&rsquo;s proven herself a fool,&rdquo; Saerin said,
&ldquo;and more than once I&rsquo;ve regretted standing for her, but
I&rsquo;ll not believe she&rsquo;s Black, not without more than
that.&rdquo; Tight-lipped, Pevara jerked an agreeing nod. As a Red, she
would want much more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as may be, Saerin,&rdquo; Yukiri said, &ldquo;but we
cannot hold Talene long before the Greens start asking where she
is. Not to mention the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the Black. We&rsquo;d better decide
what to do fast, or we&rsquo;ll still be digging at the bottom of
the well when the rains hit.&rdquo; Talene gave Saerin a feeble smile
that was probably meant to be ingratiating. It faded under the
Brown Sitter&rsquo;s frown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t dare tell Elaida anything until we can
cripple the Black at one blow,&rdquo; Saerin said finally. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
argue, Pevara; it&rsquo;s sense.&rdquo; Pevara threw up her hands and put
on a stubborn expression, but she closed her mouth. &ldquo;If Talene is
right,&rdquo; Saerin went on, &ldquo;the Black knows about Seaine or soon will,
so we must ensure her safety, as much as we can. That won&rsquo;t be
easy, with only five of us. We can&rsquo;t trust <em>anyone</em>
until we are certain of them! At least we have Talene, and who
knows what we&rsquo;ll learn before she&rsquo;s wrung out?&rdquo; Talene
attempted to look willing to be wrung out, but no one was paying
her any mind. Seaine&rsquo;s throat had gone dry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We might not be entirely alone,&rdquo; Pevara said
reluctantly. &ldquo;Seaine, tell them your little scheme with Zerah and
her friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scheme?&rdquo; Saerin said. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Zerah? Seaine?
Seaine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seaine gave a start. &ldquo;What? Oh. Pevara and I
uncovered a small nest of rebels here in the Tower,&rdquo; she began
breathily. &ldquo;Ten sisters sent to spread dissent.&rdquo; Saerin was going
to make sure she was safe, was she? Without so much as asking. She
was a Sitter herself; she had been Aes Sedai for almost a hundred
and fifty years. What right had Saerin or anyone to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? &ldquo;Pevara
and I have begun putting an end to that. We&rsquo;ve already made
one of them, Zerah Dacan, take the same extra oath Talene did, and
told her to bring Bernaile Gelbarn to my rooms this afternoon
without rousing her suspicions.&rdquo; Light, any sister outside this
room might be Black. Any sister. &ldquo;Then we will use those two to
bring another, until they have all been made to swear obedience. Of
course, we&rsquo;ll ask the same question we put to Zerah, the same
we put to Talene.&rdquo; The Black Ajah might already have her name,
already know she had been set hunting them. How could Saerin keep
her safe? &ldquo;Those who give the wrong answer can be questioned, and
those who give the right can repay for a little of their treachery
by hunting the Black under our direction.&rdquo; Light, how?</p>

<p>When she was done, the others discussed the matter at
some length, which could only mean that Saerin was unsure what
decision she would make. Yukiri insisted on giving Zerah and her
confederates over to the law immediately&mdash;if it could be done
without exposing their own situation with Talene. Pevara argued for
using the rebels, though halfheartedly; the dissent they had been
spreading centered around vile tales concerning the Red Ajah and
false Dragons. Doesine seemed to be suggesting that they kidnap
every sister in the Tower and force them all to take the added
oath, but the other three paid little attention to her.</p>

<p>Seaine took no part in the discussion. Her reaction
to their predicament was the only possible one, she thought.
Tottering to the nearest corner, she vomited noisily.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Elayne tried not to grind her teeth. Outside, another
blizzard pelted Caemlyn, darkening the midday sky enough that the
lamps along the sitting room&rsquo;s paneled walls were all lit.
Fierce gusts rattled the casements set into the tall arched
windows. Flashes of lightning lit the clear glass panes, and
thunder boomed hollowly overhead. Thunder snow, the worse kind of
winter storm, the most violent. The room was not precisely cold,
but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Spreading her fingers in front of the logs crackling in
the broad marble fireplace, she could still feel a chill rising
through the carpets layered over the floor tiles, and through her
thickest velvet slippers, too. The wide black fox collar and cuffs
on her red-and-white gown were pretty, but she was not sure they
added any more to its warmth than the pearls on the sleeves.
Refusing to let the cold touch her did not mean she was
unaware.</p>

<p>Where <em>was</em> Nynaeve? And Vandene? Her thoughts
snarled like the weather. <em>They should be here already! Light! I
wish I could learn to go without sleep, and they take their sweet
time!</em> No, that was unfair. Her formal claim for the Lion
Throne was only a few days old, and for her, everything else had to
take second place for the time being. Nynaeve and Vandene had other
priorities; other responsibilities, as they saw them. Nynaeve was
up to her neck planning with Reanne and the rest of the Knitting
Circle how to spirit Kinswomen out of Seanchan-controlled lands
before they were discovered and collared. The Kin were very good at
staying low, but the Seanchan would not just pass them by for
wilders the way Aes Sedai always had. Supposedly, Vandene was still
shaken by her sister&rsquo;s murder, barely eating and hardly able
to give advice of any sort. The barely eating part was true, but
finding the killer consumed her. Supposedly walking the halls in
grief at odd hours, she was secretly hunting the Darkfriend among
them. Three days earlier, just the thought of that could make
Elayne shiver; now, it was one danger among many. More intimate
than most, true, but only most.</p>

<p>They were doing important tasks, approved and
encouraged by Egwene, but she still wished they would hurry,
selfish though it might be. Vandene had a wealth of good advice,
the advantage of long experience and study, and Nynaeve&rsquo;s
years of dealing with the Village Council and the Women&rsquo;s
Circle back in Emond&rsquo;s Field gave her a keen eye for practical
politics, however much she denied it. <em>Burn me, I have a hundred
problems, some right here in the Palace, and I</em> need
<em>them!</em> If she had <em>her</em> way, Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara
was going to be the Aes Sedai advisor to the next Queen of Andor.
She needed all the help she could find&mdash;help she could
trust.</p>

<p>Smoothing her face, she turned away from the blazing
hearth. Thirteen tall armchairs, carved simply but with a fine
hand, made a horseshoe arc in front of the fireplace.
Paradoxically, the place of honor, where the Queen would sit if
receiving here, stood farthest from the fire&rsquo;s heat. Such as
it was. Her back began to warm immediately, and her front to cool.
Outside, snow fell, thunder crashed and lightning flared. Inside
her head, too. Calm. A ruler had as much need of calm as any Aes
Sedai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be the mercenaries,&rdquo; she said, not quite
managing to keep regret out of her voice. Armsmen from her estates
surely would begin arriving inside a month&mdash;once they learned
she was alive&mdash;but the men Birgitte was recruiting would
require half a year or more before they were fit to ride and handle
a sword at the same time. &ldquo;And Hunters for the Horn, if any will
sign and swear.&rdquo; There were plenty of both trapped in Caemlyn by
the weather. Too many of both, most people said, carousing,
brawling, troubling women who wanted no part of their attentions.
At least she would be putting them to good use, to stop trouble
instead of beginning it. She wished she did not think she was still
trying to convince herself of that. &ldquo;Expensive, but the coffers
will cover it.&rdquo; For a little while, they would. She had better
start receiving revenues from her estates soon.</p>

<p>Wonder of wonders, the two women standing before her
reacted in much the same fashion.</p>

<p>Dyelin gave an irritated grunt. A large, round silver
pin worked with Taravin&rsquo;s Owl and Oak was fastened at the high
neck of her dark green dress, her only jewelry. A show of pride in
her House, perhaps too much pride; the High Seat of House Taravin
was a proud woman altogether. Gray streaked her golden hair and
fine lines webbed the corners of her eyes, yet her face was strong,
her faze level and sharp. Her mind was a razor. Or maybe a sword. A
plainspoken woman, or so it seemed, who did not hide her
opinions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mercenaries know the work,&rdquo; she said dismissively,
&ldquo;but they are hard to control, Elayne. When you need a feather
touch, they&rsquo;re liable to be a hammer, and when you need a
hammer, they&rsquo;re liable to be elsewhere, and stealing to boot.
They are loyal to gold, and only as long as the gold lasts. If they
don&rsquo;t betray for more gold first. I&rsquo;m sure this once Lady
Birgitte will agree with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arms folded tightly beneath her breasts and heeled
boots planted wide, Birgitte grimaced, as always when anyone used
her new title. Elayne had granted her an estate as soon as they
reached Caemlyn, where it could be registered. In private, Birgitte
grumbled incessantly over that, <em>and</em> the other change in
her life. Her sky-blue trousers were cut the same as those she
usually wore, billowing and gathered at the ankles, but her short
red coat had a high white collar, and wide white cuffs banded with
gold. She was the Lady Birgitte Trahelion <em>and</em> the Captain
General of the Queen&rsquo;s Guard, and she could mutter and whine
all she wanted, so long as she kept it private.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; she growled unwillingly, and gave Dyelin a
not-quite-sidelong glare. The Warder bond carried what Elayne had
been sensing all morning. Frustration, irritation, determination.
Some of that might have been a reflection of herself, though. They
mirrored one another in surprising ways since the bonding,
emotionally and otherwise. Why, her courses had shifted by more
than a week to match the other woman&rsquo;s!</p>

<p>Birgitte&rsquo;s reluctance to take the second-best
argument was clearly almost as great as her reluctance to agree.
&ldquo;Hunters aren&rsquo;t much bloody better, Elayne,&rdquo; she muttered.
&ldquo;they took the Hunter&rsquo;s Oath to find adventure, and a place in
the histories if they can. Not to settle down keeping the law. Half
are supercilious prigs, looking down their flaming noses at
everyone else; the rest don&rsquo;t just take necessary chances,
they look for chances to take. And one whisper of a rumor of the
Horn of Valere, and you&rsquo;ll be lucky if only two in three
vanish overnight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dyelin smiled a thin smile, as though she had won a
point. Oil and water were not in it compared to those two; each
managed well enough with nearly anyone else, but for some reason
they could argue over the color of charcoal. Could and would.
&ldquo;Besides, Hunters and mercenaries alike, nearly all are foreigners.
That will sit poorly with high and low alike. Very poorly. The last
thing you want is to start a rebellion.&rdquo; Lightning flared, briefly
lighting the casements, and a particularly loud peal of thunder
punctuated her words. In a thousand years, seven Queens of Andor
had been toppled by open rebellion, and the two who survived
probably wished they had not.</p>

<p>Elayne stifled a sigh. One of the small inlaid tables
along the walls held a heavy silver ropework try with cups and a
tall pitcher of hot spiced wine. Lukewarm spiced wine, now. She
channeled briefly, Fire, and a thin wisp of steam rose from the
pitcher. Reheating gave the spices a slight bitterness, but the
warmth of the worked silver cup in her hands was worth it. With an
effort she resisted the desire to heat the air in the room with the
Power and released the Source; the warmth would not have lasted
unless she maintained the weaves, anyway. She had conquered her
unwillingness to let go every time she took in <em>saidar</em>&mdash;well, to some extent&mdash;yet of late, the desire to draw
more grew every time. Every sister had to face that dangerous
desire. A gesture brought the others to pour their own wine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know the situation,&rdquo; she told them. &ldquo;Only a fool
could think it anything but dire, and you&rsquo;re neither of you
fools.&rdquo; The Guards were a shell, a handful of acceptable men and a
double handful of strongarms and toughs better suited to throwing
drunks out of taverns, or being thrown out themselves. And with the
Saldaeans gone and the Aiel leaving, crime was blooming like weeds
in spring. She would have thought the snow would damp it down, but
every day brought robbery, arson, and worse. Every day, the
situation grew worse. &ldquo;At this rate, we&rsquo;ll see riots
in a few weeks. Maybe sooner. If I can&rsquo;t keep order in Caemlyn
itself, the people <em>will</em> turn against me.&rdquo; If she could not
keep order in the capital, she might as well announce to the world
she was unfit to rule. &ldquo; I don&rsquo;t like it but it has to be
done, so it will be.&rdquo; Both opened their mouths, ready to argue
further, but she gave them no chance. She made her voice firm. &ldquo;It
will be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Birgitte&rsquo;s waist-long golden braid swung as she
shook her head, yet grudging acceptance filtered through the bond.
She took a decidedly odd view of their relationship as Aes Sedai
and Warder, but she had learned to recognize when Elayne would not
be pressed. After a fashion she had learned. There was the estate
and title. And commanding the Guards. And a few other small
matters.</p>

<p>Dyelin bent her neck a fraction, and perhaps her
knees; it might have been a curtsy, yet her face was stone. It was
well to remember that many who did not want Elayne Trakand on the
Lion Throne wanted Dyelin Taravin instead. The woman had been
nothing but helpful, but it was early days yet, and sometimes a
niggling voice whispered in the back of Elayne&rsquo;s head. Was
Dyelin simply waiting for her to bungle badly before stepping in to
&ldquo;save&rdquo; Andor? Someone sufficiently prudent, sufficiently devious,
might try that route, and might even succeed.</p>

<p>Elayne raised a hand to rub her temple but made it
into adjusting her hair. So much suspicion, so little trust. The
Game of Houses had infected Andor since she left for Tar Valon. She
was grateful for her months among Aes Sedai for more than learning
the Power. <em>Daes Dae&rsquo;mar</em> was breath and bread, to most
sisters. Grateful for Thom&rsquo;s teaching, too. Without both, she
might not have survived her return as long as she had. The Light
send Thom was safe, that he and Mat and the others had escaped the
Seanchan and were on their way to Caemlyn. Every day since leaving
Ebou Dar she prayed for their safety, but that brief prayer was all
she had time for, now.</p>

<p>Taking the chair at the center of the arc, the
Queen&rsquo;s chair, she tried to look like a queen, back straight,
her free hand resting lightly on the carved chair arm. <em>Looking
a queen is not enough</em>, her mother had told her often, <em>but
a fine mind, a keen grasp of affairs, and a brave heart will go for
nothing if people do not</em> see <em>you as a queen</em>. Birgitte
was watching her closely, almost suspiciously. Sometimes the bond
was decidedly inconvenient! Dyelin raised her winecup to her
lips.</p>

<p>Elayne took a deep breath. She had harried this
question from every direction she knew, and she could see no other
way. &ldquo;Birgitte, by spring, I want the Guards to be an army equal to
anything <em>ten</em> Houses can put in the field.&rdquo; Impossible to
achieve, likely, but just trying meant keeping the mercenaries who
signed now and finding more, signing every man who showed the least
inclination. Light, what a foul tangle!</p>

<p>Dyelin choked, her eyes bulging; dark wine sprayed
from her mouth. Still sputtering, she plucked a lace-edged
handkerchief from her sleeve and dabbed at her chin.</p>

<p>A wave of panic shot down the bond from Birgitte.
&ldquo;Oh, burn me, Elayne, you can&rsquo;t mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;! I&rsquo;m an
archer, not a general! That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve ever been,
don&rsquo;t you understand yet? I just did what I had to do, what
circumstances forced on me! Anyway, I&rsquo;m not her, anymore;
I&rsquo;m just me and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&rdquo; She trailed off, realizing she might
have said too much. Not for the first time. Her face went crimson
as Dyelin eyed her curiously.</p>

<p>They had put it about that Birgitte was from Kandor,
where country women wore something like her clothes, yet Dyelin
clearly suspected the lie. And every time Birgitte let her tongue
slip, she came closer to letting her secret slip, too. Elayne shot
her a look that promised a talking-to, later.</p>

<p>She would not have thought Birgitte&rsquo;s cheeks
could get any redder. Mortification drowned everything else in the
bond, flooding through until Elayne felt her own face coloring.
Quickly she put on a stern expression, hoping her crimson cheeks
would pass for something other than an intense desire to squirm in
her seat with <em>Birgitte&rsquo;s</em> humiliation. That mirroring
effect could be <em>more</em> than merely inconvenient!</p>

<p>Dyelin wasted only a moment on Birgitte. Tucking her
handkerchief back in its place, she carefully set her cup back on
the tray then planted her hands on her hips. Her face was a
thunderhead, now. &ldquo;The Guards have always been the <em>core</em> of
Andor&rsquo;s army, Elayne, but this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Light&rsquo;s mercy, this
is madness! You could turn every hand against you from the River
Erinin to the Mountains of Mist!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne focused on calm. If she was wrong, Andor would
become another Cairhien, another blood-soaked land filled with
chaos. And she would die, of course, a price not high enough to
meet the cost. Not trying was unthinkable, and in any case would
have the same result for Andor as failure. Cool, composed, steely
calm. A queen could not show herself afraid, even when she was.
Especially when she was. Her mother had always said to explain
decisions as seldom as possible; the more often you explained, the
more explanations were necessary, until they were all you had time
for. Gareth Bryne said to explain if you could; your people did
better if they knew the why as well as the what. Today, she would
follow Gareth Bryne. A good many victories had been won following
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have three declared challengers.&rdquo; And maybe one
not declared. She made herself meet Dyelin&rsquo;s gaze. Not
angrily; just eyes meeting eyes. Or maybe Dyelin did take it for
anger, with her jaw tight and her face flushed. If so, so be it.
&ldquo;By herself, Arymilla is negligible, but Nasin has joined House
Caeren to her, and whether or not he&rsquo;s sane, his support means
she must be considered. Naean and Elenia are imprisoned; their
armsmen are not. Naean&rsquo;s people may dither and argue until
they find a leader, but Jarid is High Seat of Sarand, and he will
take chances to feed his wife&rsquo;s ambition. House Baryn and
House Anshar flirt with both; the <em>best</em> I can hope for is
that one goes with Sarand and one with Arawn. Nineteen Houses in
Andor are strong enough that smaller Houses will follow where they
lead. Six are arrayed against me, and I have two.&rdquo; Six so far, and
the Light send she had two! She would not mention the three great
Houses that had all but declared for Dyelin; at least Egwene had
them tied down in Murandy for now.</p>

<p>She motioned to a chair near her, and Dyelin sat,
carefully arranging her skirts. The storm clouds had left the older
woman&rsquo;s face. She studied Elayne, giving no hint as to her
questions or conclusions. &ldquo;I know all that as well as you, Elayne,
but Luan and Ellorien will bring their Houses to you, and Abelle
will as well, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo; A careful voice, too, but it gathered
heat as she went on. &ldquo;Other Houses will see reason, then. As long
as you don&rsquo;t frighten them <em>out</em> of reason. Light,
Elayne, this is not a Succession. Trakand succeeds Trakand, not
another House. Even a Succession has seldom come to open fighting!
Make the Guards into an army, and you risk everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne threw her head back, but her laughter held no
amusement. It fit right in with the peals of thunder. &ldquo;I risked
everything the day I came home, Dyelin. You say Norwelyn and
Traemane will come to me, and Pendar? Fine; then I have five to
face six. I don&rsquo;t think the other Houses will &lsquo;see
reason,&rsquo; as you put it. If any of them move before it&rsquo;s
clear as good glass the Rose Crown is mine, it will be against me,
not for.&rdquo; With luck, those lords and ladies would shy away from
associating with cronies of Gaebril, but she did not like depending
on luck. She was not Mat Cauthon. Light, most people were sure Rand
had killed her mother, and few believed that &ldquo;Lord Gaebril&rdquo; had
been one of the Forsaken. Mending the damage Rahvin had done in
Andor might take her entire lifetime even if she managed to live as
long as the Kinswomen! Some Houses would stand aside from
supporting her because of the outrages Gaebril had perpetrated in
Morgase&rsquo;s name, and others because Rand had said he intended
to &ldquo;give&rdquo; her the throne. She loved the man to her toes, but
<em>burn</em> him for giving voice to <em>that</em>! Even if it was
what reined in Dyelin. The meanest crofter in Andor would shoulder
his scythe to pull a puppet from the Lion Throne!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to avoid Andoran killing Andoran If I can,
Dyelin, but Succession or no Succession, Jarid is ready to fight,
even with Elenia locked away. Naean is ready to fight.&rdquo; Best to
bring both women to Caemlyn as soon as possible; too much chance of
them slipping messages, and orders, out of Aringill.
&ldquo;<em>Arymilla</em> is ready, with Nasin&rsquo;s men behind her. To
them, this <em>is</em> a Succession, and the only way to
<em>stop</em> them from fighting is to be so strong they don&rsquo;t
dare. If Birgitte can build the Guards into an army by spring, well
and good, because if I don&rsquo;t have an army before then, I
<em>will</em> have need of one. And if that isn&rsquo;t enough,
remember the Seanchan. They won&rsquo;t be satisfied with Tanchico
and Ebou Dar; they want everything. I won&rsquo;t let them have
Andor, Dyelin, any more than I&rsquo;ll let Arymilla.&rdquo; Thunder
roared overhead.</p>

<p>Twisting a little to look back at Birgitte, Dyelin
moistened her lips. Her fingers plucked unconsciously at her
skirts. Very little frightened her, but the tales of the Seanchan
had. What she murmured, though, as if to herself, was &ldquo;I had hoped
to avoid outright civil war.&rdquo; And <em>that</em> might mean nothing,
or a great deal! Perhaps a little probing might show which.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gawyn,&rdquo; Birgitte said suddenly. Her expression had
lightened, and so had the emotions flowing through the bond. Relief
stood out strong. &ldquo;When he comes, he&rsquo;ll take command.
He&rsquo;ll be your First Prince of the Sword.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s milk in a cup!&rdquo; Elayne snapped, and
lightning flared in the windows for emphasis. Why did the woman
have to change the subject <em>now</em>? Dyelin gave a start, and
heat flooded back into Elayne&rsquo;s face. By the older
woman&rsquo;s gaping mouth, she knew exactly how coarse that curse
was. Strangely embarrassing, that; it should not have counted for
anything that Dyelin had been her mother&rsquo;s friend. Unthinking,
she took a deep swallow of wine&mdash;and nearly gagged at the
bitterness. Quickly she suppressed images of Lini threatening to
wash out her mouth and reminded herself that she was a grown woman
with a throne to win. She doubted her mother had ever found herself
feeling foolish so often.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he will, Birgitte,&rdquo; she went on, more calmly.
&ldquo;When he comes.&rdquo; Three couriers were on their way to Tar Valon.
Even if none managed to get past Elaida, Gawyn would learn
eventually that she had made her claim, and he would come. She
needed him desperately. She had no illusions of herself as a
general, and Birgitte was so fearful she could not live up to the
legends about her that sometimes she seemed afraid to try. Face an
army, yes; lead an army, never under the sun!</p>

<p>Birgitte was well aware of the tangle in her own
mind. Right that moment her face was frozen, but her emotions were
full of self-anger and embarrassment, with the first growing
stronger by the moment. With a stab of irritation, Elayne opened
her mouth to pursue Dyelin&rsquo;s mention of civil war before she
began reflecting Birgitte&rsquo;s anger.</p>

<p>Before she could utter a word, though, the tall red
doors opened. Her hopes for Nynaeve or Vandene were dashed by the
entrance of two Sea Folk women, barefoot despite the weather.</p>

<p>A cloud of musky perfume wafted ahead of them, and by
themselves they made up a procession in brightly brocaded silk
trousers and blouses, jeweled daggers and necklaces of gold and
ivory. And other jewelry. Straight black hair with white at the
temples nearly hid the ten small, fat golden rings in Renaile din
Calon&rsquo;s ears, but the arrogance in her dark eyes was as plain
as the medallion-laden golden chain that connected one earring to
her nose ring. Her face was set, and despite a graceful sway to her
walk, she appeared ready to stride through a wall. Nearly a hand
shorter than her companion and darker than charcoal, Zaida din
Parede wore half again as many golden medallions dangling on her
left cheek and carried an air of command rather than arrogance, a
sure certainty that she would be obeyed. Gray flecked her cap of
tight black curls, yet she was stunning, one of those women who
grew more and more beautiful as they aged.</p>

<p>Dyelin flinched at sight of them, and half raised a
hand to her nose before she could stop herself. A common enough
reaction in people unused to the Atha&rsquo;an Miere. Elayne
grimaced, and not for their nose rings. She even considered another
curse, something more&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;pungent. Excepting the Forsaken, she
could not have named two people she wanted less to see right then.
Reene was supposed to see this did not happen!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; she said, rising smoothly, &ldquo;but I am
very busy, now. Matters of state, you understand, or I would greet
you as your stations deserve.&rdquo; The Sea Folk were sticklers for
ceremony and propriety, at least on their own terms. Very likely
they had gotten past the First Maid by simply not telling her they
wanted to see Elayne, but they easily might take offense if she
greeted them sitting before the crown was hers. And, the Light burn
both of them, she could not afford to offend. Birgitte appeared at
her side, bowing formally to take her cup; the Warder bond carried
wariness. She was always ginger around the Sea Folk; she had let
her tongue slip around them, too. &ldquo;I will see you later in the
day,&rdquo; Elayne finished, adding, &ldquo;The Light willing.&rdquo; They also were
great ones for ceremonial turns of phrase, and that one showed
courtesy <em>and</em> gave a way out.</p>

<p>Renaile did not stop until she stood right in front
of Elayne, and much too close. One tattooed hand gestured curt
permission for her to sit. Permission. &ldquo;You have been avoiding me.&rdquo;
Her voice was deep for a woman, and as chill as the snow falling on
the roof. &ldquo;Remember that I am Windfinder to Nesta din Reas Two
Moons, Mistress of the Ships to the Atha&rsquo;an Miere. You still
must fulfill the rest of the bargain you made for your White
Tower.&rdquo; The Sea Folk knew of the division in the Tower&mdash;by
this time, everyone and her sister knew&mdash;but Elayne had not
seen fit to add to her difficulties by making public which side she
was on. Not yet. Renaile finished on an imperious, commanding note.
&ldquo;You <em>will</em> deal with me, and <em>now</em>!&rdquo; So much for
ceremony and propriety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has been avoiding me, I think, not you,
Windfinder.&rdquo; In contrast to Renaile, Zaida sounded as though she
were merely making conversation. Rather than rushing across the
carpets, she moved idly about the room, pausing to touch a tall
vase of thin green porcelain, then rising on her toes to peer
through a four-barreled kaleidoscope atop a tall stand. When she
glanced toward Elayne and Renaile, an amused glint twinkled in her
black eyes. &ldquo;After all, the bargain was with Nesta din Reas,
speaking for the ships.&rdquo; In addition to Wavemistress of Clan
Catelar, Zaida was an ambassador from the Mistress of the Ships. To
Rand, not Andor, but her warrant gave the authority to speak and
bind for Nesta herself. Changing one gold-chased barrel for
another, she went on tiptoe to look through the eyepiece again.
&ldquo;You promised the Atha&rsquo;an Miere twenty teachers, Elayne. So
far you have delivered one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their entrance had been so sudden, so dramatic, that
Elayne was surprised to see Merilille turn from closing the doors.
Shorter still than Zaida, the Gray sister was elegant in dark blue
wool trimmed with silvery fur and sewn with small moonstones across
the bodice, yet barely more than two weeks teaching the Windfinders
had brought changes. Most were powerful women with a thirst for
knowledge, more than ready to squeeze Merilille like a grape in the
winepress, demanding the last drop of juice. Once, Elayne had
thought her self-possessed beyond the ability to surprise, but now
Merilille was constantly wide-eyed, her lips always a little
parted, as though she had just been startled half out of her wits
and expected to be startled again any moment. Folding her hands at
her waist, she waited by the doorway, and appeared relieved to be
out of the center of attention.</p>

<p>Harrumphing loudly, Dyelin got to her feet and
scowled at Zaida and Renaile both. &ldquo;Have a care how you speak,&rdquo; she
growled. &ldquo;You are in Andor, now, not on one of our ships, and
Elayne Trakand will be Queen of Andor! Your <em>bargain</em> will
be met in good time. For now, we have more important matters to
contend with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Under the Light, there are none more important,&rdquo;
Renaile rumbled in turn, rounding on her. &ldquo;You say the bargain will
be met? So you stand surety. Know there will be room to dangle you
by your ankles in the rigging as well if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zaida snapped her fingers. That was all, but a tremor
passed through Renaile. Snatching the golden scent-box dangling
from one of her necklaces, she pressed it to her nose and breathed
deeply. Windfinder to the Mistress of the Ships she might be, a
woman of great authority and power among the Atha&rsquo;an Miere,
but to Zaida, she was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a Windfinder. Which grated her pride
excessively. Elayne was sure there must be a way to use that to
keep them out of her hair, but she had not found it, yet. Oh, yes;
for good or ill, <em>Daes Dae&rsquo;mar</em> was in her bones,
now.</p>

<p>She glided around a silently furious Renaile as if
around a column, a part of the room, though not toward Zaida. If
anyone had a right be be casual here, she did. She could not afford
to give Zaida a hair of advantage, or the Wavemistress would shave
her scalp for wigmakers. At the fireplace, she spread her hands in
front of the flames again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nesta din Reas trusted we would fulfill the bargain,
or she never would have agreed to it,&rdquo; she said calmly. &ldquo;You have
regained the Bowl of the Winds, but assembling nineteen more
sisters to join you requires time. I know you worry about the ships
that were at Ebou Dar when the Seanchan came. Have Renaile make a
gateway to Tear. There are hundreds of Atha&rsquo;an Miere vessels
there.&rdquo; Every report said so. &ldquo;You can learn what they know, and
rejoin your people. They will have need of you, against the
Seanchan.&rdquo; And she would be rid of them. &ldquo;The other sisters will be
sent to you as soon as can be arranged.&rdquo; Merilille did not move
from the doorway, but her face took on a green tinge of panic at
the possibility of being alone among the Sea Folk.</p>

<p>Zaida gave over looking through the kaleidoscope and
eyed Elayne sideways. A smile quirked her very full lips. &ldquo;I must
remain here, at least until I speak to Rand al&rsquo;Thor. If he
ever comes.&rdquo; That smile tightened for an instant before blooming
once more; Rand would have a hard time with her. &ldquo;And I will keep
Renaile and her companions, for the time. A handful of Windfinders
more or less will make no great difference against these Seanchan,
and here, the Light willing, they may learn what will be useful.&rdquo;
Renaile snorted, just loudly enough to be heard. Zaida frowned
briefly and began fiddling with the eyepiece that stood level with
the top of her head. &ldquo;There are five Aes Sedai here in your palace,
counting yourself,&rdquo; she murmured thoughtfully. &ldquo;Perhaps some of you
might teach.&rdquo; As though the idea had just occurred to her. And if
that were so, Elayne could lift both Sea folk women with one
hand!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, that would be wonderful,&rdquo; Merilille burst
out, taking a step forward. Then she glanced at Renaile and
subsided, a blush suffusing her Cairhienin paleness. Folding her
hands at her waist once more, she snatched meekness around herself
like a second skin. Birgitte shook her head in amazement. Dyelin
stared as if she had never seen the Aes Sedai before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something may be worked out, if the Light pleases,&rdquo;
Elayne said cautiously. Not rubbing at her temples took effort. She
wished she could blame the ache inside her skull on the incessant
thunder. Nynaeve would erupt at the suggestion, and Vandene likely
would ignore any such order, but Careane and Sareitha might be
possible. &ldquo;For no more than a few hours a day, you understand. When
they have time.&rdquo; She avoided looking at Merilille. Even Careane and
Sareitha might rebel at being tossed into that winepress.</p>

<p>Zaida touched the fingers of her right hand to her
lips. &ldquo;It is agreed, under the light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne blinked. That was ominous; in the
Wavemistress&rsquo;s eyes, apparently, they had just made another
bargain. Her limited experience of dealing with the Atha&rsquo;an
Miere was that you were lucky to walk away with your shift. Well,
this time things were going to be different. For instance, what
were the sisters to gain in it? There had to be two sides to a
bargain. Zaida smiled, as if she knew what Elayne was thinking and
was amused. One of the doors opening again was almost a relief,
giving her an excuse to turn away from the Sea Folk woman.</p>

<p>Reene Harfor slipped into the room with deference but
without servility, and her curtsy was restrained, suitable for the
High Seat of a powerful House to her Queen. But then, any High Seat
worth a pinch of salt knew enough to offer respect to the First
Maid. Her graying hair was arranged in a bun, like a crown atop her
head, and she wore a scarlet tabard over her red-and-white dress,
with the White Lion of Andor&rsquo;s head resting on her formidable
bosom. Reene had no say in who would sit on the throne, but she had
adopted full formal dress on the day of Elayne&rsquo;s arrival, as
if the Queen already were in residence. Her round face hardened
momentarily at sight of the Atha&rsquo;an Miere women who had
bypassed her, but that was all the notice she gave them. For now.
They would learn to their cost what incurring the animosity of the
First Maid entailed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mazrim Taim has come at last, my Lady.&rdquo; Reene
managed to make that sound very like &ldquo;my Queen.&rdquo; &ldquo;Shall I tell him
to wait?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Not beforetime!</em> Elayne muttered in her head.
She had summoned the man two days ago! &ldquo;Yes, Mistress Harfor. Give
him wine. The third best, I think. Inform him that I will see him
as soon as I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taim strode into the room as though he owned the
Palace. She did not need him named. Blue-and-gold Dragons wove
round the sleeves of his black coat from elbows to cuffs, in
imitation of the Dragons on Rand&rsquo;s arms. Though she suspected
he would not appreciate the observation. He was tall, nearly as
tall as Rand, with a hooked nose and dark eyes like augurs, a
physically powerful man who moved with something of a Warder&rsquo;s
deadly grace, but shadows seemed to follow him, as if half the
lamps in the room had gone out; not real shadows, but an air of
imminent violence that seemed palpable enough to soak up light.</p>

<p>Two more black-coated men followed at his heels, a
bald fellow with a long grizzled beard and leering blue eyes, and a
younger man, snake-slim and dark-haired, with the sneering
arrogance young men often adopted before they learned better. Both
wore the silver Sword and red-enameled Dragon on their tall
collars. None of the three wore a sword on his hip, though; they
did not need swords. Suddenly the sitting room felt smaller, and
crowded.</p>

<p>Instinctively, Elayne embraced <em>saidar</em> and
reached out to link. Merilille slipped into the circle easily;
astoundingly, so did Renaile. A quick glance at the Windfinder
lessened her surprise. Her face gray, Renaile was gripping the
dagger thrust behind her sash so hard that Elayne could feel the
pain in her knuckles through the link. She had been in Caemlyn long
enough to be aware of what an Asha&rsquo;man was.</p>

<p>The men knew someone had embraced <em>saidar</em>, of
course, even if they could not see the glow surrounding the three
women. The bald man stiffened; the slim young man clenched his
fists. They stared with angry eyes. Surely they had seized
<em>saidin</em>. Elayne began to regret giving in to reflex, but
she was not going to let go of the Source, not now. Taim radiated
danger the way a fire gave off heat. She drew deeply through the
link, to the point where the overwhelming sense of life became
sharp, warning prickles. Even those felt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;joyous. With that
much of the Power in her, she could lay waste to the Palace, but
she wondered whether it was enough to match Taim and the other two.
She very much wished she had one of the three <em>angreal</em> they
had found in Ebou Dar, now safely locked away with the rest of the
things from the cache until she had time to study them again.</p>

<p>Taim shook his head contemptuously, a half-smile
flickering across his lips. &ldquo;Use your eyes.&rdquo; His voice was quiet,
but hard and sneering. &ldquo;There are two Aes Sedai here. Are you
afraid of two Aes Sedai? Besides, you don&rsquo;t want to frighten
the future Queen of Andor.&rdquo; His companions relaxed visibly, then
began trying to emulate the unthinking dominance of his stance.</p>

<p>Reene knew nothing of <em>saidar</em> or
<em>saidin</em>; she had rounded on the men, scowling, as soon as
they entered. Asha&rsquo;man or no Asha&rsquo;man, she expected
people to behave as they should. She muttered something almost
under her breath. Not quite far enough under, though. The words
&ldquo;sneaking rats&rdquo; were just audible.</p>

<p>The First Maid reddened when she realized everyone in
the room had heard, and Elayne got a chance to see Reene Harfor
flustered. Which was to say that the woman drew herself up and
said, with a grace and dignity any ruler might envy, &ldquo;Forgive me,
my Lady Elayne, but I&rsquo;ve been told there are rats infesting
the storerooms. Most unusual this time of year, and so many of
them. If you will excuse me, I must make sure my orders for
ratcatchers and poison baits are being carried out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; Elayne told her coolly. Calmly. &ldquo;Vermin can
be dealt with in due time.&rdquo; Two Aes Sedai. He did not realize
Renaile could channel and he had <em>emphasized</em> two. Would
just three women give some advantage? Or did it take more? Plainly
the Asha&rsquo;man knew of <em>some</em> advantage to women in
numbers less than a circle of thirteen. Walk in on her without so
much as a by-your-leave, would they? &ldquo;You can show these goodmen
out when I&rsquo;m done with them.&rdquo; Taim&rsquo;s companions scowled
at being called &ldquo;goodmen,&rdquo; but the man himself merely flashed
another of those almost-smiles. He was quick enough to know she had
been thinking of him when she spoke of vermin. Light! Maybe Rand
had needed this man once, but why would he keep him now, and in a
position of such authority? Well, his authority counted for nothing
here.</p>

<p>Unhurriedly, she took her chair again, and gave a
moment to adjusting her skirts. The men would have to come around
in front of her like supplicants, or else talk to the side of her
head while she refused to look at them. For an instant she
considered passing control of the small circle. The Asha&rsquo;man
would surely focus their attention on her. Renaile was still gray,
though, anger and fear tumbling over one another inside her; she
might strike out as soon as the link was hers. Merilille had some
fear, just under control, mixed with a very great deal of a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;goosey&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;feeling that matched her wide eyes and parted lips;
the Light alone knew what <em>she</em> might do with the link.</p>

<p>Dyelin glided to the side of Elayne&rsquo;s chair, as
if to shield her from the Asha&rsquo;man. Whatever lay inside the
High Seat of Taravin, her face was stern, unfrightened. The other
women had wasted no time in preparing as best they could. Zaida
stood very still beside the kaleidoscope, doing her best to look
diminutive and harmless, but her hands were behind her back and the
dagger was missing from behind her sash. Birgitte lounged beside
the fireplace, left hand propped on the jamb, seemingly at her
ease, but the sheath of her belt knife was empty, and from the way
her other hand rested by her side, she was ready for an underhand
throw. The bond carried&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;focus. Arrow nocked, drawn to cheek,
ready to loose.</p>

<p>Elayne made no effort to look around Dyelin at the
three men. &ldquo;First you are too slow obeying my summons, Master Taim,
and then too sudden.&rdquo; Light <em>was</em> he holding
<em>saidin</em>? There were methods of interfering with a man
channeling short of shielding him, but it was a difficult skill,
chancy, and she knew little more than the theory.</p>

<p>He did come in front of her, several paces off, but
he did not look a supplicant. Mazrim Taim knew who he was and his
own worth, though he plainly set it higher than the sky. Lightning
flashed in the windows sent strange lights across his face. Many
would feel overawed by him, even without his fancy coat or his
infamous name. She did not. She <em>would</em> not!</p>

<p>Taim rubbed his chin thoughtfully, &ldquo;I understand
you&rsquo;ve taken down the Dragon banners all over Caemlyn,
Mistress Elayne.&rdquo; There was <em>amusement</em> in his deep voice if
none in his eyes! Dyelin hissed in fury at the slight to Elayne,
but he ignored her. &ldquo;The Saldaeans have withdrawn to the Legion of
the Dragon&rsquo;s camp, I hear, and soon the last of the Aiel will
be in camps outside the city, as well. What will he say when he
learns?&rdquo; There was no doubt who he meant. &ldquo;And after he&rsquo;s sent
you a gift, too. From the south. I&rsquo;ll have it delivered
later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will ally Andor with the Dragon Reborn in due
course,&rdquo; she told him coldly, &ldquo;but Andor is <em>not</em> a
conquered province, not for <em>him</em> or anyone else.&rdquo; She made
her hands stay relaxed on the arms of the chair. Light, talking the
Aiel and Saldaeans into leaving had been her biggest achievement
yet, and even with the flare-up in crime, it had been necessary!
&ldquo;In any case, Master Taim, it is not your place to call me to task.
If Rand objects, I will deal with <em>him</em>!&rdquo; Taim raised an
eyebrow, and that odd quirk of his mouth lingered.</p>

<p><em>Burn me</em>, she thought indignantly, <em>I
shouldn&rsquo;t have used Rand&rsquo;s name!</em> The man clearly
thought he knew <em>exactly</em> how she would deal with the anger
of the bloody Dragon Reborn! The worst of it was, if she could trip
Rand into a bed, she would. Not for this, not to <em>deal</em> with
him, but because she wanted to. What sort of gift had he sent
her?</p>

<p>Anger hardened her voice. Anger at Taim&rsquo;s tone,
at Rand for staying away so long. At herself, for blushing and
thinking of gifts. Gifts! &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve walled in four
<em>miles</em> of Andor.&rdquo; Light, that was more than half as large
as the Inner City! How many of these fellows could it hold? The
thought made her skin crawl. &ldquo;With whose permission, Master Taim?
Don&rsquo;t tell me the Dragon Reborn. He has no right to give
permission for <em>anything</em> in Andor.&rdquo; Dyelin shifted beside
her. No right, but enough strength could make right. Elayne kept
her attention on Taim. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve refused the Queen&rsquo;s Guards
entry to your&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>compound</em>.&rdquo; Not that they had tried
before she came home. &ldquo;The law in Andor runs over <em>all</em> of
Andor, Master Taim. Justice <em>will</em> be the same for lord or
farmer&mdash;or Asha&rsquo;man. I won&rsquo;t claim I can force my
way in.&rdquo; He began to smile again, or nearly so. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
demean myself. But unless the Queen&rsquo;s Guards are allowed in, I
promise you not so much as a potato will go through your gates,
either. I know you can Travel. Let your Asha&rsquo;man spend their
days Traveling to buy food.&rdquo; The almost-smile vanished in a faint
grimace; his boots shifted slightly.</p>

<p>Annoyance lasted only an instant, though. &ldquo;Food is a
small problem,&rdquo; he said smoothly, spreading his hands. &ldquo;As you say,
my men can Travel. To anywhere I command. I doubt you could stop me
buying whatever I want even ten miles from Caemlyn, but it
wouldn&rsquo;t bother me if you could. Still, I am willing to allow
visits whenever you ask. Controlled visits, with escorts at all
times. The training is hard in the Black Tower. Men die almost
every day. I would not want any accidents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was irritatingly accurate on how far from Caemlyn
her writ ran. But no more than irritating. Were his remarks about
Traveling anywhere he commanded and &ldquo;accidents&rdquo; meant to be veiled
threats? Surely not. A wave of fury ran through her as she realized
that she was certain he would not threaten her because of Rand. She
would <em>not</em> hide behind Rand al&rsquo;Thor.
<em>Controlled</em> visits? When she <em>asked</em>? She ought to
burn the man to a cinder where he stood!</p>

<p>Abruptly she became aware of what was coming through
the bond from Birgitte, anger, a reflection of hers, joining with
Birgitte&rsquo;s, reflecting from Birgitte to her, bouncing from her
to Birgitte, feeding on itself, building. Birgitte&rsquo;s knife
hand quivered with the desire to throw. And herself? Fury filled
her! A whisker more, and she would lose <em>saidar</em>. Or lash
out with it.</p>

<p>With an effort she forced rage down, into a semblance
of calm. A rough, seething, semblance. She swallowed, and struggled
to keep her voice level. &ldquo;The Guards will visit every day, Master
Taim.&rdquo; And how she was to manage that in this weather, she did not
know. &ldquo;Perhaps I will come myself, with a few other sisters.&rdquo; If
the thought of having Aes Sedai inside his Black Tower upset Taim,
he did not show it. <em>Light</em>, she was trying to establish
Andor&rsquo;s authority, not goad the man. Hurriedly she did a
novice exercise&mdash;the river contained by the bank&mdash;seeking calm. It worked, a little. Now she merely wanted to throw
all the winecups at him. &ldquo;I will accede to your request for
escorts, but nothing is to be hidden. I won&rsquo;t have crimes
concealed by your secrets. Do we understand one another?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taim&rsquo;s bow was mocking&mdash;mocking!&mdash;but there was a tightness in his voice. &ldquo;I understand you
perfectly. Understand me, though. My men are not farmers knuckling
their foreheads when you pass. Press an Asha&rsquo;man too hard, and
you may learn just how strong your law is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne opened her mouth to tell him exactly how
strong the law was in Andor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is time, Elayne Trakand,&rdquo; a woman&rsquo;s voice
said from the doorway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blood and ashes!&rdquo; Dyelin muttered. &ldquo;Is the whole
<em>world</em> just going to walk in here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne recognized the new voice. She had been
expecting this summons, without knowing when it would come. Knowing
that it must be obeyed, though, on the instant. She stood, wishing
she could have a little longer to make matters clear to Taim. He
frowned at the woman who had just entered, and at Elayne, clearly
uncertain what to make of this. Good. Let him stew until she had
time to set him straight on what special rights Asha&rsquo;man had
in Andor.</p>

<p>Nadere stood as tall as either of the two men by the
door, a wide woman, as close to stout as any Aiel Elayne had seen.
Her green eyes examined the pair for a moment before dismissing
them as unimportant. Asha&rsquo;man did not impress Wise Ones. Very
little did. Adjusting her dark shawl on her shoulders in a clatter
of bracelets, she walked over in front of Elayne, her back to Taim.
Despite the cold, she wore only that shawl over her thin white
blouse, though oddly, she carried a heavy wool cloak draped across
one arm. &ldquo;You must come now,&rdquo; she told Elayne, &ldquo;without delay.&rdquo;
Taim&rsquo;s eyebrows seemed to be climbing his forehead; no doubt
he was unaccustomed to being so thoroughly ignored.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light of heaven!&rdquo; Dyelin breathed, massaging her
forehead. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what this is about, Nadere, but it
will have to wait until&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne laid a hand on her arm. &ldquo;You
<em>don&rsquo;t</em> know, Dyelin, and it <em>can&rsquo;t</em> wait.
I will send everyone away and come with you, Nadere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Wise One shook her head disapprovingly. &ldquo;A child
waiting to be born cannot take time to send people away.&rdquo; She shook
out the thick cloak. &ldquo;I brought this to shield your skin from the
cold. Perhaps I should leave it, and tell Aviendha your modesty is
greater than your desire for a sister.&rdquo; Dyelin gasped in sudden
realization. The Warder bond quivered with Birgitte&rsquo;s
outrage.</p>

<p>There was only one choice possible. No choice,
really. Letting the link to the other two women dissolve, she
released <em>saidar</em> herself. The glow remained around Remaile
and Merilille, though. &ldquo;Will you help me with my buttons, Dyelin?&rdquo;
Elayne was proud of how steady her voice was. She had expected
this. <em>Just not with so many</em> witnesses! she thought
faintly. Turning her back on Taim&mdash;at least she would not
have to see him watching her!&mdash;she began with the tiny
buttons on her sleeves. &ldquo;Dyelin, if you please? Dyelin?&rdquo; After a
moment Dyelin moved as if sleep walking and began fumbling with the
buttons down Elayne&rsquo;s back, muttering to herself in shocked
tones. One of the Asha&rsquo;man by the doors snickered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About turn!&rdquo; Taim snapped, and boots stamped by the
doors.</p>

<p>Elayne did not know whether he had turned away as
well&mdash;she was certain she could feel his eyes on her&mdash;but suddenly Birgitte was there, and Merilille and Reene, and
Zaida, and even Renaile, crowding shoulder-to-shoulder, scowling as
they formed a wall between her and the men. Not a very adequate
wall. None were as tall as she, and neither Zaida nor Merilille
stood higher than her shoulder.</p>

<p><em>Focus</em>, she told herself. <em>I am composed,
I am tranquil. I am</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>I&rsquo;m stripping naked in a
room full of people is what I am!</em> She undressed as hurriedly
as she could, letting her dress and shift fall to the floor,
tossing her slippers and stockings on top of them. Her skin pebbled
in the cool air; ignoring the chill just meant she was not
shivering. And she rather thought the heat in her cheeks might have
something to do with that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madness!&rdquo; Dyelin muttered in a low voice, snatching
up the clothes. &ldquo;Utter madness!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this about?&rdquo; Birgitte whispered. &ldquo;Should I
come with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must go alone,&rdquo; Elayne whispered back. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
argue!&rdquo; Not that Birgitte gave any outward sign of it, but the bond
carried volumes. Taking the golden hoops from her ears, she handed
them to Birgitte, then hesitated before adding her Great Serpent
ring. The Wise Ones had said she must come as a child came to
birth. They had had a great many instructions, first among them to
tell no one what was coming. For that matter, <em>she</em> wished
she knew. A child came to birth without foreknowledge of what was
to happen. Birgitte&rsquo;s mutterings began to sound like
Dyelin&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Nadere came forward with the cloak, but simply held
it out; Elayne had to take it and wrap it around herself hastily.
She was still sure she could feel Taim&rsquo;s gaze. Holding the
heavy wool close, her instinct was to hurry from the room, but
instead she drew herself up and turned around slowly. She would not
<em>scurry</em> out cloaked in shame.</p>

<p>The men who had come with Taim stood rigidly, facing
the doors, and Taim himself was peering at the fireplace, arms
folded across his chest. The feel of his eyes had been imagination,
then. Excepting Nadere, the other women looked at her in variations
of curiosity, consternation and shock. Nadere merely seemed
impatient.</p>

<p>Elayne tried for her most queenly voice. &ldquo;Mistress
Harfor, you will offer Master Taim and his men wine, before they
go.&rdquo; Well, at least it did not tremble. &ldquo;Dyelin, please entertain
the Wavemistress and the Windfinder, and see if you can allay their
fears. Birgitte, I expect to hear your plan for recruiting
tonight.&rdquo; The women she named blinked in startlement, nodded
wordlessly.</p>

<p>Then she walked from the room, followed by Nadere,
wishing she could have done better. The last thing she heard before
the door closed behind her was Zaida&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Strange
customs, you shorebound have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the corridor she tried to move a little faster,
though it was not easy while keeping the cloak from gaping. The
red-and-white floor tiles were <em>much</em> colder than the
carpets in the sitting room. A few servants, warmly bundled in good
woolen livery, stared when they saw her, then hurried on about
their tasks. The flames of the stand-lamps flickered; there were
always drafts in the hallways. Occasionally the air stirred enough
to make a wall hanging ripple lazily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was on purpose, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she said to
Nadere, not really asking a question. &ldquo;Whenever you called me,
you&rsquo;d have made sure there were plenty of people to watch. To
make sure adopting Aviendha was important enough to me.&rdquo; It had to
be more important than <em>anything</em> else, they had been told.
&ldquo;What did you do to <em>her</em>?&rdquo; Aviendha seemed to have very
little modesty sometimes, often walking around her apartments
unclothed and unconcerned, not even noticing when servants entered.
Making <em>her</em> undress in a crowd would have proved
nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is for her to tell you if she wishes,&rdquo; Nadere
said complacently. &ldquo;You are sharp to see it; many do not.&rdquo; Her
large bosom heaved in a grunt that might have been a laugh. &ldquo;Those
men, turning their backs, and those women, guarding you. I would
have put a stop to it if the man in the embroidered coat had not
kept looking over his shoulder to admire your hips. And if your
blushes had not said you knew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne missed a step and stumbled. The cloak flared,
losing the little body warmth it had trapped before she could
snatch it closed again. &ldquo;That filthy pig-kisser!&rdquo; she growled.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&rdquo; Burn her, what <em>could</em>
she do? Tell Rand? Let <em>him</em> deal with Taim? Never in
life!</p>

<p>Nadere eyed her quizzically. &ldquo;Most men enjoy looking
at a woman&rsquo;s bottom. Stop thinking about men, and start
thinking about the woman you want for a sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flushing again, Elayne put her mind on Aviendha. It
did nothing to settle her nerves. There were specific things she
had been told to think on before the ceremony, and some made her
uneasy.</p>

<p>Nadere kept her pace to Elayne&rsquo;s, and Elayne
took great care not to let her legs flash through the cloak&rsquo;s
opening&mdash;there were servants everywhere&mdash;so it took
them some little time to reach the room where the Wise Ones were
gathered, more than a dozen of them in their bulky skirts and white
blouses and dark shawls, decked with necklaces and bracelets of
gold and silver, gems and ivory, their long hair held back with
folded scarves. All the furnishings and carpets had been cleared
out, leaving bare white floor tiles, and there was no fire on the
hearth. Here, deep in the palace, with no windows, the crash of
thunder was barely audible.</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s eyes went straight to Aviendha,
standing on the far side of the room. Naked. She smiled at Elayne
nervously. Nervously! Aviendha! Hurriedly throwing off the cloak,
Elayne smiled back. Nervously, she realized. Aviendha gave a soft
laugh, and after a moment, Elayne did, too. Light, the air was
<em>cold</em>! And the floor was colder!</p>

<p>She did not know most of the Wise Ones in the room,
but one face jumped at her. Amys&rsquo; prematurely white hair
combined with features that appeared short of their middle years to
give her something of the look of an Aes Sedai. She must have
Traveled from Cairhien. Egwene had been teaching the dreamwalkers,
to repay their teaching about <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>.
And to meet a debt, she claimed, though she had never made clear
what debt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hoped Melaine would be here,&rdquo; Elayne said. She
liked Bael&rsquo;s wife, a warm and generous woman. Not like two
others in the room she recognized, bony Tamela with her angular
face, and Viendre, a beautiful, blue-eyed eagle. Both were stronger
in the Power than she, stronger than any sister she had met save
Nynaeve. That was not supposed to matter among Aiel, but she could
think of no other reason why they always sneered and looked down
their noses when they saw her.</p>

<p>She expected Amys to take charge&mdash;Amys always
did, it seemed&mdash;but it was a short woman named Monaelle, her
hair yellow with hints of red, who stepped forward. Not truly
short, yet still the only woman in the room shorter than Elayne.
And the weakest in the Power, too, barely strong enough, had she
gone to Tar Valon, to have earned the shawl. Perhaps that really
did not count with Aiel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were Melaine here,&rdquo; Monaelle said, her tone brisk
but not unfriendly, &ldquo;the babes she carries would be part of the
bond between you and Aviendha, if the weaves brushed them. If they
survived, that is; the unborn are not strong enough for this. The
question is, are the two of you?&rdquo; She gestured with both hands,
pointing to spots on the floor not far from her. &ldquo;Come here to the
middle of the chamber, both of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the first time, Elayne realized that
<em>saidar</em> was to be part of this. She had thought it would be
just a ceremony, pledges exchanged, perhaps oaths given. What
<em>was</em> going to happen? It did not matter, except&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Her
steps dragged as she moved toward Monaelle. &ldquo;My warder&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Our
bond&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Will she be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;affected&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;by this?&rdquo; Aviendha,
coming to face her, had frowned when Elayne hesitated, but at the
question, she swung startled eyes to Monaelle. Clearly, it was
something she had not thought of.</p>

<p>The short Wise One shook her head. &ldquo;No one outside
this chamber can be touched by the weaves. She may sense some part
of what you share with each other, because of her bond with you,
but only a very little.&rdquo; Aviendha heaved a sigh of relief that
Elayne echoed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Monaelle went on. &ldquo;There are forms to be
followed. Come. We are not clan chiefs discussing water pledges
over <em>oosquai</em>.&rdquo; Laughing, making what seemed to be jokes
about clan chiefs and the strong Aiel liquor, the other women
formed a circle around Aviendha and Elayne. Monaelle settled
gracefully to the floor, sitting cross-legged two paces to one side
of the bare women. Laughter ceased as her voice became formal. &ldquo;We
are gathered because two women wish to be first-sisters. We will
see whether they are strong enough, and if they are, help them. Are
their mothers present?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne gave a start, but the next moment Viendre was
behind her. &ldquo;I stand for Elayne Trakand&rsquo;s mother, who cannot
be here.&rdquo; Hands on Elayne&rsquo;s shoulders, Viendre pushed her
forward and pressed down until she was kneeling on the cold tiles
in front of Aviendha, then knelt behind her. &ldquo;I offer my daughter
to her testing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tamela appeared behind Aviendha, pressing her down
with her knees almost touching Elayne&rsquo;s, kneeling at her back. &ldquo;I
stand for Aviendha&rsquo;s mother, who cannot be here. I offer my
daughter to her testing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another time, Elayne might have giggled. Neither
woman looked more than a half-dozen years older than Aviendha or
her. Another time. Not now. The standing Wise Ones wore solemn
faces. They were studying her and Aviendha as if weighing them,
unsure they would measure up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who will suffer the pangs of birth for them?&rdquo;
Monaelle asked, and Amys stepped forward.</p>

<p>Two others came with her, a fiery redhead named
Shyanda, whom Elayne had seen with Melaine, and a graying woman she
did not know. They helped Amys strip to her skin. Proud in her
nakedness, Amys faced Monaelle and slapped her taut belly. &ldquo;I have
borne children. I have given suck,&rdquo; she said, cupping breasts that
looked as if she had done nothing of the kind. &ldquo;I offer
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At Monaelle&rsquo;s dignified nod of acceptance, Amys
went to her knees two paces on the other side of Elayne and
Aviendha and settled back on her heels. Shyanda and the graying
Wise One knelt flanking her, and suddenly the glow of the Power
surrounded every woman in the room except Elayne, Aviendha and
Amys.</p>

<p>Elayne took a deep breath, and saw Aviendha do the
same. Occasionally a bracelet clicked against another among the
Wise Ones, the only sound in the room beyond breathing, and faint,
distant thunder. It was almost a shock when Monaelle spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will both do as you are instructed. If you waver
or question, your dedication is not strong enough. I will send you
away, and that will be the end of it, forever. I will ask
questions, and you will answer truthfully. If you refuse to answer,
you will be sent away. If any here think you lie, you will be sent
away. You may leave at any time on your own, of course. Which also
will end this for all time. There are no second chances here. Now.
What is the best you know of the woman you want for a
first-sister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne half-expected the question. This was one of
the things she had been told to think about. Choosing one virtue
among many had not been easy, yet she had her answer ready. When
she spoke, flows of <em>saidar</em> suddenly wove together between
her and Aviendha, and no sound came from her tongue, or
Aviendha&rsquo;s. Without thought, a part of her mind tucked away
the weaves; even now, trying to learn was as much a part of her as
the color of her eyes. The weaves vanished as her lips closed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aviendha is so confident, so proud. She doesn&rsquo;t
care what anyone thinks she should do, or be; she is who
<em>she</em> wants to be,&rdquo; Elayne heard her own voice say, while
Aviendha&rsquo;s words suddenly were audible at the same time. &ldquo;Even
when Elayne is so afraid that her mouth dries, her spirit will not
bend. She is braver than anyone I have ever known.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne stared at her friend. Aviendha thought she was
<em>brave</em>? Light, she was no coward, but <em>brave</em>?
Strangely, Aviendha was staring at <em>her</em> in disbelief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Courage is a well,&rdquo; Viendre said at Elayne&rsquo;s
ear, &ldquo;deep in some, shallow in others. Deep or shallow, wells go
dry eventually, even if they fill again later. You will face what
you cannot face. Your spine will turn to jelly, and your vaunted
courage will leave you weeping in the dust. The day will come.&rdquo; She
sounded as though she wanted to be there to see it come. Elayne
gave a curt nod. She knew all about her spine turning to jelly; she
fought it every day, it seemed.</p>

<p>Tamela was speaking to Aviendha, in a voice almost as
satisfied as Viendre&rsquo;s. &ldquo;<em>Ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em> binds you
like bands of steel. For <em>ji</em>, you make yourself exactly
what is expected of you, to the last hair. For <em>toh</em>, if
necessary you will abase yourself and crawl on your belly. Because
you care to your <em>bones</em> what <em>everyone</em> thinks of
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne nearly gasped. That was harsh, and unfair. She
knew something of <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>, but Aviendha was not
like that. Yet Aviendha was nodding, much as she herself had. An
impatient acceptance of what she already knew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine traits to love in a first-sister,&rdquo; Monaelle
said, lifting her shawl down to her elbows, &ldquo;but what do you find
worst in her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne shifted on her chilling knees, licked her lips
before speaking. She had dreaded this. It was not just
Monaelle&rsquo;s warning. Aviendha had said they must speak the
truth. <em>Must</em>, or what was sisterhood worth? Again the
weaves held their words captive until they were done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aviendha&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Elayne&rsquo;s voice said suddenly,
hesitantly. &ldquo;She&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she thinks violence is always the answer. At
times, she won&rsquo;t think beyond her belt knife. At times,
she&rsquo;s like a boy who won&rsquo;t grow up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elayne knows that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Aviendha&rsquo;s voice
began, then gulped and went on in a rush. &ldquo;She knows she is
beautiful, knows the power it gives her over men. She exposes half
her bosom sometimes, in the open air, and she smiles to make men do
what she wants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne gaped. Aviendha thought <em>that</em> of her?
It made her sound a <em>lightskirt</em>! Aviendha frowned back and
half-opened her mouth, but Tamela pressed her shoulders again and
began to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think men do not stare at your face in
approval?&rdquo; There was an edge in the Wise One&rsquo;s voice; strong
was the best anyone would ever say of her face. &ldquo;Do they not look
at your breasts in the sweat tent? Admire your hips? You are
beautiful, and you now it. Deny it, and deny yourself! You have
taken pleasure in men&rsquo;s looks, and smiled at them. Will you
never smile at a man to give your arguments more weight, or touch
his arm to distract him from the weakness of your arguments? You
will, and you will be no less for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Red flooded Aviendha&rsquo;s cheeks, but Elayne was
having to listen to Viendre. And fight blushes of her own. &ldquo;There
is violence in you. Deny it, and deny yourself. Have you never
raged and struck out? Have you never drawn blood? Have you never
<em>wished</em> to? Without any thought at all? While you breathe,
that will be part of you.&rdquo; Elayne though of Taim, and other times,
and her face felt like a furnace. This time, there was more than
one response.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your arms will grow weak,&rdquo; Tamela was telling
Aviendha. &ldquo;Your legs will lose their swiftness. A youth will be
able to take the knife from your hand. How will skill or ferocity
avail you then? Heart and mind are the true weapons. But did you
learn to use the spear in a day, when you were a Maiden? If you do
not hone mind and heart now, you will grow old and children will
befuddle your wits. Clan chiefs will sit you in a corner to play
cat&rsquo;s cradle, and when you speak, all will hear only the wind.
Take heed while you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beauty flees,&rdquo; Viendre went on, to Elayne. &ldquo;Years
will make your breasts sag, your flesh grow slack, your skin grow
leathery. Men who smiled to see your face will speak to you as if
you were just another man. Your husband may see you always as the
first time his eyes caught you, but no other man will dream of you.
Will you no longer be you? Your body is only clothing. Your flesh
will wither, but you are your heart and mind, and they do not
change except to grow stronger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne shook her head. Not in denial. Not really. She
had never thought on aging, though. Especially not since going to
the Tower. The years lay lightly even on very old Aes Sedai. But
what if she lived as long as the Kinswomen? That would mean giving
up being Aes Sedai, of course, but what if she did? The Kin took a
very long time to grow wrinkles, but grow them they did. What was
Aviendha thinking? She knelt there looking&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;sullen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the most childish thing you know of the
woman you want for a first-sister?&rdquo; Monaelle said.</p>

<p>This was easier, not so fraught. Elayne even smiled
as she spoke. Aviendha grinned back, sullenness gone. Again the
weaves took their words and released them together, voices with
laughter in them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aviendha won&rsquo;t let me teach her to swim.
I&rsquo;ve tried. She isn&rsquo;t afraid of anything, except getting
into more water than a bathtub.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elayne gobbles sweets with both hands like a child
who&rsquo;s escaped her mother&rsquo;s eye. If she keeps on, she will
be fat as a pig before she grows old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne jerked. Gobbles? <em>Gobbles?</em> A taste,
now and then, was all she took. Just now and then. <em>Fat?</em>
Why was Aviendha glaring at <em>her</em>? Refusing to step into
water more than knee deep <em>was</em> childish.</p>

<p>Monaelle covered a slight cough with one hand, but
Elayne thought she was hiding a smile. Some of the standing Wise
Ones laughed outright. At Aviendha&rsquo;s silliness? Or her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>gobbling?</em></p>

<p>Monaelle resumed dignity, adjusting her skirts spread
out of the floor, but there was still a touch of mirth in her
voice. &ldquo;What is your greatest jealousy of the woman you want for a
first-sister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps Elayne would have hedged her answer despite
the requirement for truth. Truth had jumped up as soon as she was
told to think on this, but she had found something smaller, less
embarrassing for them both, that would have passed muster. Perhaps.
But there was that about her smiling at men and exposing her bosom.
Maybe she did smile, but Aviendha walked in front of red-faced
serving men without a <em>stitch</em> on and seemed not even to
<em>see</em> them! So she <em>gobbled</em> candy, did she? She was
going to get fat? She spoke the bitter truth while the weaves took
her words and Aviendha&rsquo;s mouth moved in grim silence, until at
last, what they had said was loosed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aviendha has lain in the arms of the man I love. I
never have; I may never, and I could weep over it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elayne has the love of Rand al&rsquo;Th&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;of
<em>Rand</em>. My heart is dust for wanting him to love me, but I
do not know if he ever will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne peered into Aviendha&rsquo;s unreadable face.
She was jealous of her over <em>Rand</em>? When the man avoided
Elayne Trakand as if she had scabies? She had no time for more
though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strike her as hard as you can with your open hand,&rdquo;
Tamela told Aviendha, removing her own hands from Aviendha&rsquo;s
shoulders.</p>

<p>Viendre squeezed Elayne&rsquo;s lightly. &ldquo;Do not
defend yourself.&rdquo; They had not been told anything of this! Surely,
Aviendha would not&mdash;</p>

<p>Blinking, Elayne pushed herself up from the icy floor
tiles. Gingerly she felt her cheek, and winced. She was going to
wear a palm print the rest of the day. The woman did not have to
hit her <em>that</em> hard.</p>

<p>Everyone waited until she was kneeling again, and
then Viendre leaned closer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strike her as hard as you can with your open
hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well <em>she</em> was not going to knock Aviendha on
her ear. She was not going to&mdash;Her full-armed slap sent
Aviendha sprawling, sliding on her chest across the tiles almost to
Monaelle. Elayne&rsquo;s palm stung almost as much as her cheek.</p>

<p>Aviendha half pushed herself up, gave her head a
shake, then scrambled back to her position. And Tamela said,
&ldquo;Strike her with the other hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This time, Elayne slid all the way to Amys&rsquo;s
knees on the frozen tiles, her head ringing, <em>both</em> cheeks
burning. And when she regained her own knees in front of Aviendha,
when Viendre told her to strike, she put her whole body into the
slap, so much that she nearly fell over atop Aviendha as the other
woman went down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may go now,&rdquo; Monaelle said.</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s eyes jerked toward the Wise One.
Aviendha, halfway back to her knees, went stiff as a stone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you wish to,&rdquo; Monaelle continued. &ldquo;Men usually
do, at this point if not sooner. Many women do, too. But if you
still love one another enough to go on, then embrace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne flung herself at Aviendha, and was met with a
rush that nearly knocked her over backwards. They clung together.
Elayne felt tears trickling from her eyes, and realized Aviendha
was crying as well. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Elayne whispered fervently.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Aviendha.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; Aviendha whispered back. &ldquo;Forgive
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monaelle was standing over them, now. &ldquo;You will know
anger at one another again, you will speak harsh words, but you
will always remember that you have already struck her. And for no
better reason than you were told to. Let those blows pass for all
you might wish to give. You have <em>toh</em> toward one another,
<em>toh</em> you cannot repay and will not try to, for every woman
is always in her first-sister&rsquo;s debt. You will be born
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The feel of <em>saidar</em> in the room was changing,
but Elayne had no chance to see how even had she thought of it. The
light dwindled as if the lamps were being put out. The feel of
Aviendha&rsquo;s hug dwindled. Sound dwindled. The last thing she
heard was Monaelle&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;You will be born again.&rdquo;
Everything faded. She faded. She ceased to exist.</p>

<p>Awareness, of a sort. She did not think of herself as
she, she did not think at all, but she was aware. Of sound. A
liquid swishing around. Muted gurgles and rumbles. And a rhythmic
thudding. That above all. <em>Thu-thud. Thu-thud</em>. She did not
know contentment, but she was content. <em>Thu-thud</em>.</p>

<p>Time. She did not know time, yet Ages passed. There
was a sound within her, a sound that <em>was</em> her.
<em>Thu-thud</em>. The same sound, the same rhythm as the other.
<em>Thu-thud</em>. And from another place, nearer.
<em>Thu-thud</em>. Another. <em>Thu-thud</em>. The same sound, the
same beat, as her own. Not another. They were the same; they were
one. <em>Thu-thud</em>.</p>

<p>Forever went by to that pulse, all the time that had
ever been. She touched the other that was herself. She could feel.
<em>Thu-thud</em>. She moved, she and the other that was herself,
writhing against one another, limbs entangling, rolling away but
always coming back to each other. <em>Thu-thud</em>. There was
light sometimes, in the darkness; dim beyond seeing, but bright to
one who had never known anything but darkness. <em>Thu-thud</em>.
She opened her eyes, stared into the eyes of the other that was
herself, and closed hers again, content. <em>Thu-thud</em>.</p>

<p>Change, sudden, shocking to one who had never known
any change. Pressure. <em>Thu-thud-thu-thud</em>. That comforting
beat was faster. Convulsive pressure. Again. Again. Getting
stronger. <em>Thu-thud-thu-thud! Thu-thud-thu-thud!</em></p>

<p>Suddenly, the other that was herself&mdash;was gone.
She was alone. She did not know fear, but she was afraid, and
alone. <em>Thu-thud-thu-thud!</em> Pressure! Greater than anything
before! Squeezing her, crushing her. If she had known how to
scream, if she had known what a scream was, she would have
shrieked.</p>

<p>And then light, blinding, full of swirling patterns.
She had weight; she had never felt weight before. A cutting pain at
her middle. Something tickled her foot. Something tickled her back.
At first she did not realize that wailing sound was coming from
her. She kicked feebly, waved limbs that did not know how to move.
She was lifted, laid on something soft but firmer than anything she
had felt before, except for recollections of the other that was
herself, the other that was gone. <em>Thu-thud. Thu-thud</em>. The
sound. The same sound, the same beat. Loneliness reigned,
unrecognized, but there was contentment, too.</p>

<p>Memory began to return, slowly. She lifted her head
from a breast and looked up into Amys&rsquo; face. Yes, Amys.
Sweat-slick and weary-eyed, but smiling. And she was Elayne; yes,
Elayne Trakand. But there was something more to her, now. Not like
the Warder bond, but like it in a way. Fainter, but more
magnificent. Slowly, on a neck that wobbled uncertainly, she turned
her head to look at the other that was herself, lying on Amys&rsquo;
other breast. To look at Aviendha, her hair matted, her face and
body shining with sweat. Smiling with joy. Laughing, weeping, they
clutched each other and hung on as if they never intended to let
go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is my daughter Aviendha,&rdquo; Amys said, &ldquo;and this
is my daughter Elayne, born on the same day, within the same hour.
May they always guard one another, support one another, love one
another.&rdquo; She laughed softly, tiredly, fondly. &ldquo;And now will
someone bring us garments before my new daughters and I all freeze
to death?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne did not care at that moment if she did freeze
to death. She clung to Aviendha in laughter and tears. She had
found her sister. Light, she had found her sister!</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Toveine Gazal woke up to the sounds of quiet bustle,
other women moving about, some talking softly. Lying on her hard
narrow cot, she sighed with regret. Her hands around Elaida&rsquo;s
throat had been just a pleasant dream. This tiny canvas-walled room
was reality. She had slept poorly, and she felt thinned, drained.
She had overslept, too; there would be no time for breakfast.
Reluctantly she tossed off her blankets. The building had been a
small warehouse of some sort, with thick walls and heavy rafters
low overhead, but there was no heat. Her breath misted, and the
crisp morning air pricked through her shift before her feet reached
the rough floorboards. Even if she could have considered lying abed
in this place, she had her orders. Logain&rsquo;s filthy bond made
disobedience impossible, no matter how often she wished it.</p>

<p>She always tried to think of him as simply Ablar, or
at worst Master Ablar, but it was always just Logain that came into
her mind. The name he had made infamous. Logain, the false Dragon
who had shattered the armies of his native Ghealdan. Logain who had
carved a path through the few Altarans and Murandians with nerve
enough to try stopping him until he threatened Lugard itself.
Logain, who had been gentled and somehow could channel again, who
had dared to fix his cursed weave of <em>saidin</em> on Toveine
Gazal. A pity for him he had not commanded her to stop thinking!
She could <em>feel</em> the man, in the back of her head. He was
always there.</p>

<p>For a moment, she squeezed her eyes shut. Light!
Mistress Doweel&rsquo;s farm had seemed the Pit of Doom, years of
exile and penance with no way out except the unthinkable, to become
a hunted renegade. Barely half a week since her capture, she knew
better. <em>This</em> was the Pit of Doom. And there was no escape.
Angrily, she shook her head, and scrubbed glistening dampness from
her cheeks with her fingers. No! She would escape, somehow, if only
for long enough to put her real hands on Elaida&rsquo;s throat.
Somehow.</p>

<p>Aside from the cot, there were only three pieces of
furniture, yet they left little space for her to move. She cracked
the ice in the yellow-striped pitcher on the washstand with her
belt knife, filled the chipped basin, and channeled to heat water
till tendrils of steam rose. It was <em>allowed</em> to channel for
that. That and no more. By rote she washed and scrubbed her teeth
with salt and soda, then took a fresh shift and stockings from the
small wooden chest at the foot of the cot. Her ring she left in the
chest, tucked under everything else in a small velvet pouch.
Another order. All of her things were here, except for her lapdesk.
Luckily, that had been lost when she was taken. Her dresses hung on
a cloakstand, the last of the room&rsquo;s furnishings. Choosing one
without really looking, she put it on mechanically and used comb
and brush on her hair.</p>

<p>The ivory-backed brush slowed as she really saw
herself in the washstand&rsquo;s cheap, bubbled mirror. Breathing
raggedly, she set the brush down beside the matching comb. The
dress she had chosen was thick, finely woven wool of an unadorned
red so dark it seemed nearly black. Black, like an
Asha&rsquo;man&rsquo;s coat. Her distorted image stared back at her,
lips writhing. Changing would be a sort of surrender. Determinedly
she snatched her marten-lined gray cloak from the stand.</p>

<p>When she pushed aside the canvas doorflap, twenty or
so sisters already occupied the long central hallway lined with
canvas rooms. Here and there a few were speaking in murmurs, but
the rest avoided each other&rsquo;s eyes, even when they belonged to
the same Ajah. Fear had its presence, but it was shame that coated
most faces. Akoure, a stout Gray, was staring at the hand where she
normally wore her ring. Desandre, a willowy Yellow, was hiding her
right hand in her armpit.</p>

<p>The soft conversations trailed off when Toveine
appeared. Several women glared at her openly. Including Jenare and
Lemai, from her own Ajah! Desandre came to herself enough to turn
her back stiffly. In the space of two days, fifty-one Aes Sedai had
fallen captive to the black-coated monsters, and fifty of them
blamed Toveine Gazal as though Elaida a&rsquo;Roihan had no hand in
the disaster at all. Except for Logain&rsquo;s intervention, they
would have had their revenge their first night here. She did not
love him for putting a stop to it and making Carniele Heal the
welts left by belts, the bruises left by fists and feet. She would
rather they had beaten her to death than owe him.</p>

<p>Putting her cloak on her shoulders, she walked
proudly down the corridor, out into pale morning sunshine that
suited her washed-out mood. Behind her, someone shouted acid words
before the closing door cut them off. Her hands trembled as she
pulled up her hood, nestling the dark fur around her face. No one
got away with pushing down Toveine Gazal. Even Mistress Doweel, who
had crushed her into a semblance of submission over the years,
learned that when her exile ended. She would show them. She would
show them all!</p>

<p>The dormitory she shared with the others lay on the
very edge of a large village, if a very strange one. A village of
Asha&rsquo;man. Elsewhere, so she had been told, ground was marked
off for structures they claimed would dwarf the White Tower, but
this was where most of them lived now. Five large, blocky stone
barracks, spaced along streets as wide as anything in Tar Valon,
could each hold a hundred Asha&rsquo;man Soldiers. They were not
full yet, the Light be thanked, but snow-covered scaffolding
awaited the arrival of workmen around the thick walls of two more
that were almost ready for roofing in thatch. Nearly a dozen
smaller stone structures were made to hold ten Dedicated each, and
another of those was under construction, too. Scattered around them
stood nearly two hundred houses that might have been seen in any
village, where some of the married men lived, and the families of
others not far enough along in training.</p>

<p>Men who could channel did not frighten her. Once she
had given in to panic for a moment, true, but that was beside the
point. Five hundred men who could channel, however, were a scrap of
bone wedged between two of her teeth where she could not free it.
Five <em>hundred</em>! And they could Travel, some of them. A sharp
scrap of bone. More, she had tramped the mile or more through the
woods to the wall. <em>That</em> frightened her, what it
signified.</p>

<p>Nowhere was the wall finished, nowhere more than
twelve or fifteen feet high, none of the towers or bastions more
than begun. In places, she could have clambered over the piles of
black stone, except for her orders not to attempt escape. The thing
ran for <em>eight</em> miles, though, and she believed Logain when
he said it was begun less than three months ago. The man held her
too tightly to bother with lying. He called the wall a waste of
time and effort, and perhaps it was, but it made her teeth chatter.
Just three months. Made using the Power. The male half of the
Power. When she thought of that black wall, she saw an implacable
force that could not be stopped, an avalanche of black stone
sliding down to bury the White Tower. Impossible, of course.
Impossible, but when she did not dream of strangling Elaida, she
dreamed of that.</p>

<p>There had been snowfall in the night, and a heavy
blanket of white covered every roof, but she did not have to pick
her way along the broad streets. The hard-packed dirt had been
cleared, a chore of men in training before the sun came up. They
used the Power for everything from filling wood-boxes to cleaning
their clothes! Black-clad men hurried here and there in the
streets, and more were gathering in rows in front of their barracks
with others calling roll in loud voices. Women bundled up against
the cold walked past them, placidly carrying baskets to the
quartermaster&rsquo;s storehouse or water buckets to the nearest
fountain, though how any woman could remain, knowing what her
husband was, was beyond Toveine&rsquo;s comprehension. Even more
bizarre, children ran up and down the street, around the squares of
men who could channel, shouting and laughing, rolling hoops,
tossing painted balls, playing with dolls or dogs. A drop of
normality that heightened the evil stench of the rest.</p>

<p>Ahead of her, a mounted party was approaching up the
street at a walk. In the short time she had been here&mdash;the
endless time&mdash;she had not seen anyone ride in the village
except workmen on carts or wagons. Nor any visitors, which some of
these plainly must be. Five men in black were escorting a dozen in
the red coats and cloaks of the Queen&rsquo;s Guard, with two
yellow-haired women at the front, one in a red-and-white cloak
lined with black fur and the other&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Toveine&rsquo;s eyebrows
climbed. The other wore green Kandori trousers and a coat made up
as if it belonged to the Captain-General of the Guard. Her red
cloak even had golden knots of rank on the shoulder! Maybe she was
mistaken about the men. That one would find short shift when she
encountered real Guardsmen. In any case, it was strangely early for
visitors.</p>

<p>Each time the odd party reached one of the
formations, the man in front shouted &ldquo;Asha&rsquo;man, attend front!&rdquo;
and boot heels stamped on the hardened earth as the others
stiffened like pillars of stone.</p>

<p>Pulling her hood forward better to hide her face,
Toveine moved to the side of the wide street, close beside the
corner of one of the smaller stone barracks. A fork-bearded old man
coming out, a silver sword pin on his high collar, glanced at her
curiously without slowing his stride.</p>

<p>What she had done struck her like a bucket of cold
water, and she nearly wept. None of those strangers would spot an
Aes Sedai face, now, if they could recognize one. If either of
those women could channel, unlikely though that was, she would not
pass close enough to tell that Toveine could, too. She fretted and
fumed over how to disobey Logain, and then did everything necessary
to carry out his instructions without even thinking about it!</p>

<p>As an act of defiance, she stopped where she was,
turning to watch the visitors. Automatically, her hands checked her
hood before she could snatch them to her sides. It was pitiful, and
ridiculous. She knew the Asha&rsquo;man guiding the party, by sight
at least, a bulky man in his middle years with oily black hair, an
oily smile, and eyes like augurs. None of the others, though. What
could she hope to gain by this? How could she entrust a message to
any of them? Even if the escort vanished, how could she get close
enough to pass a message when she was forbidden to let any outsider
discover the presence of Aes Sedai?</p>

<p>The auger-eyed fellow looked bored with his duty this
morning, hardly bothering to hide his yawns behind a gloved hand. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;when we do finish here,&rdquo; he was saying as he rode past
Toveine, &ldquo;I will show you the Craft Town. Quite a bit bigger than
this. We do have every kind of craftsfolk, from masons and
carpenters to metalsmiths and tailors. We can make everything we
need, Lady Elayne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Except turnips,&rdquo; one of the women said in a high
voice, and the other laughed.</p>

<p>Toveine&rsquo;s head jerked. She watched the riders
move on down the street accompanied by shouted orders and stamping
boots. Lady Elayne? Elayne Trakand? The younger of the pair might
match the description she had been given. Elaida did not reveal why
she was so desperate to lay her hands on one runaway Accepted, even
one who might become a queen, but she never let a sister leave the
Tower without orders on what to do if she encountered the girl.
<em>Be very careful, Elayne Trakand</em>, Toveine thought. <em>I
would not like Elaida to have the satisfaction of laying hands on
you</em>.</p>

<p>She wanted to think on this, on whether there was
some way to use the girl&rsquo;s presence here, but abruptly she
became aware of the sensations at the back of her head. A mild
contentment and a growing purpose. Logain had finished his
breakfast. He would be coming out, soon. He had told her to be
there when he did.</p>

<p>Her feet were running before she thought. With the
result that her skirts tangled in her legs, and she fell hard,
knocking her breath out. Anger welled up, fury, but she scrambled
to her feet and, without pausing to brush off the dust, gathered
her skirts about her knees and began to run again, cloak billowing
behind. Men&rsquo;s raucous shouts followed her down the street, and
laughing children pointed as she ran past.</p>

<p>Suddenly a pack of dogs was around her, snarling,
nibbling at her heels. She leapt and spun and kicked, but they
harried her. She wanted to shriek with frustration and fury. Dogs
were always a bother, and she could not channel a feather to drive
them off. A gray hound seized a mouthful of dangling skirt, pulling
her sideways. Panic overwhelmed everything else. If she fell again,
they would tear her to shreds.</p>

<p>A shouting woman in a brown wool swung her heavy
basket at the dog tugging Toveine&rsquo;s skirt, making it dodge
away. A round woman&rsquo;s bucket caught a brindled cur in the
ribs, and it ran yelping. Toveine gaped in astonishment, and for
her inattention had to pull her left leg away from another dog at
the cost of a piece of her stocking and a little skin. There were
women all around her, flailing away at the animals with whatever
they had to hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on with you, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; a skinny, graying woman
told her, slicing at a spotted dog with a switch. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t
bother you more. I&rsquo;d like a nice cat, myself, but cats
won&rsquo;t abide the husband now. Go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toveine did not wait to thank her rescuers. She ran,
considering furiously. The women knew. If one did, they all did.
But they would carry no messages, give no help to an escape, not
when they were willing to remain themselves. Not if they understood
what they were helping. There was that.</p>

<p>Just short of Logain&rsquo;s house, one of several
down a narrower side street, she slowed and hastily let down her
skirts. Eight or nine men in black coats were waiting outside, boys
and oldsters and in between, but there was no sign of Logain yet.
She could still sense him, full of purpose but concentrating.
Reading, perhaps. She walked the rest of the way at a dignified
pace. Composed and every inch an Aes Sedai, no matter the
circumstances. She almost managed to forget her frantic flight from
the dogs.</p>

<p>The house surprised her every time she saw it. Others
on the street were as large and two larger. An ordinary wooden
house of two stories, though the red door, shutters and window
frames looked odd. Plain curtains hid the interior, but the glass
in the windows was so poor she doubted she could have seen anything
clearly with the curtains drawn. A house suitable for a not overly
successful shopkeeper; hardly the dwelling for one of the most
notorious men alive.</p>

<p>Briefly she wondered what was keeping Gabrelle. The
other sister bonded to Logain had the same instruction she did, and
until now, she had always been here first. Gabrelle was eager,
studying the Asha&rsquo;man as if she intended writing a book on the
subject. Perhaps she did; Browns would write about anything. She
put the other sister out of her mind. Although, if Gabrelle did
turn up late, she would have to find out how the woman had managed
it. For now, she had her own studying.</p>

<p>The men outside the red door eyed her, but said
nothing, even to each other. Still there was no animosity. They
were simply waiting. None had a cloak, though their breath made
pale feathers in front of their faces. All were Dedicated, with the
silver sword pin on their collars.</p>

<p>It had been the same every morning she had
<em>reported</em> this way, though not always the same men. She
knew some, knew their names at least, and sometimes a few other
gleaned tidbits. Evin Vinchova, the pretty lad who had been there
when Logain captured her, leaning against the corner of the house
and toying with a bit of string. Donalo Sandomere, if that was his
real name, with his creased farmer&rsquo;s face and sharply trimmed
oiled beard, attempting the languid stance he thought a nobleman
would assume. The Taraboner Androl Genhald, a square fellow with his
heavy eyebrows drawn in thought and his hands clasped behind his
back; he wore a gold signet ring, but she thought him an apprentice
who had shaved his mustaches and abandoned his veil. Mezar Kurin, a
Domani with gray at his temples, fingering the garnet in his left
ear; he very well might be a minor noble. She was collecting a neat
file of names and faces in her head. Sooner or later they would be
hunted down, and every piece of information that could help
identify them would be useful.</p>

<p>The red door opened, and the men straightened, but it
was not Logain who came out.</p>

<p>Toveine blinked in surprise, then met Gabrelle&rsquo;s
sooty green eyes with a flat stare, making no effort to hid her
disgust. That accursed link with Logain had made clear what he was
up to the night before&mdash;she had been afraid she would
<em>never</em> fall asleep!&mdash;but not in her darkest
imaginings had she suspected Gabrelle! Some of the men seemed as
startled as she. Some attempted to hid smiles. Kurin grinned openly
and stroked his thin mustache with a thumb.</p>

<p>The dusky woman did not even have the grace to blush.
She lifted her upturned nose a trifle, then boldly adjusted her
dark blue dress over her hips as if to advertise that she had just
donned the garment. Sweeping her cloak around her shoulders, she
tied the ribbons as she glided toward Toveine, as serene as if she
were back in the Tower.</p>

<p>Toveine grabbed the taller woman&rsquo;s arm, pulling
her a little way from the men. &ldquo;We may be captives, Gabrelle,&rdquo; she
whispered harshly, &ldquo;but that is no reason to surrender. Especially
to Ablar&rsquo;s vile lusts!&rdquo; The other woman did not so much as
look abashed! A thought came. Of course. &ldquo;Did he&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Did he
<em>order</em> you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>With something close to a sneer, Gabrelle pulled
free. &ldquo;Toveine, it took me two days to decide I should &lsquo;surrender&rsquo; to his lusts, as you put it. I feel lucky it
only required four to convince him to let me. You Reds might not be
aware, but men love to talk and gossip. All you need do is listen,
or even pretend to, and a man will tell you his whole life.&rdquo; A
thoughtful frown creased her forehead, and the twist to her lips
vanished. &ldquo;I wonder whether it&rsquo;s like that for ordinary
women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whether what is like what?&rdquo; Toveine demanded.
Gabrelle was <em>spying</em> on him? Or just trying to get more
material for her book? But <em>this</em> was unbelievable, even for
a Brown! &ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That musing expression never left the other&rsquo;s
face. &ldquo;I felt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;helpless. Oh, he was gentle, but I never really
thought before on how strong a man&rsquo;s arms are, and me unable
to channel a whisker. He was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;in charge, I suppose, though
that isn&rsquo;t quite right. Just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;stronger, and I knew it. It
felt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;strangely exhilarating.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toveine shuddered. Gabrelle must be insane! She was
about to tell her so when Logain himself appeared, closing the door
behind him. He was tall, taller than any other man there, with dark
hair that brushed wide shoulders and framed an arrogant face. His
high collar carried both the silver sword and that ridiculous snake
with legs. He flashed a smile at Gabrelle as the others gathered
around him. The hussy smiled back, too. Toveine shuddered again.
Exhilarating. The woman <em>was</em> insane!</p>

<p>As on previous mornings, the men began making
reports. Most of the time, Toveine had not been able to make
<em>up</em> from <em>down</em> with them, but she listened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I found two more who seem interested in that new
kind of Healing this Nynaeve used on you, Logain,&rdquo; Genhald said,
frowning, &ldquo;but one can barely do the Healing we already know, and
the other, he wants to know more than I could tell him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you can tell him is all I know,&rdquo; Logain
replied. &ldquo;Mistress al&rsquo;Meara didn&rsquo;t tell me much of what
she was doing, and I could only learn bits and pieces listening to
the other sisters talk. Just keep planting the seed and hope
something grows. It&rsquo;s all you can do.&rdquo; Several other men
nodded along with Genhald.</p>

<p>Toveine filed it away. Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara. She had
heard that name often after returning to the Tower. Another runaway
Accepted, another one Elaida wanted more than the normal desire to
catch runaways seemed to account for. From the same village as
al&rsquo;Thor, too. And associated somehow with Logain. That might
lead to something, eventually. But a <em>new</em> kind of Healing?
Used by an <em>Accepted</em>? That was unlikely bordering close on
impossible, but she had seen the impossible happen before, so she
tucked it away. Gabrelle was listening closely, too, she noticed.
But watching her as well, out of the corner of her eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a problem with some of those Two Rivers
men, Logain,&rdquo; Vinchova said. An angry flush rose on his smooth
face. &ldquo;Men, I say, but these two are boys, fourteen at most! They
won&rsquo;t say.&rdquo; He might have been a year or two older, with his
beardless cheeks. &ldquo;It was a crime, bringing them here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Logain shook his head; whether it was in anger or
regret was hard to say. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard the White Tower takes
girls as young as twelve. Look after the Two Rivers men where you
can. No coddling, or the others will turn on them, but try to see
they don&rsquo;t do anything stupid. The Lord Dragon might not like
it if we kill too many from his district.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t seem to be caring much at all as I
can see,&rdquo; a sleek fellow muttered. The sound of Murandy was strong
in his mouth, though his fiercely curled mustaches told where he
was from plainly enough. He was rolling a silver coin across the
backs of his fingers and seemed as intent on that as on Logain. &ldquo;I
was hearing it was the Lord Dragon himself told the M&rsquo;Hael to
pluck up anything male in this Two Rivers that could channel, down
to the roosters. With the number he brought back, I&rsquo;m just
surprised he didn&rsquo;t bring the chicks and lambs, as well.&rdquo;
Chuckles met his sally, but Logain&rsquo;s level tones cut them like
a blade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever the Lord Dragon ordered, I trust I&rsquo;ve
made my orders clear.&rdquo; Every head nodded this time, and some men
murmured &ldquo;Yes, Logain&rdquo; and &ldquo;As you say, Logain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toveine hastily smoothed the sneer from her lips.
Ignorant louts. The Tower accepted girls under fifteen only if they
had already begun channeling. The other was interesting, though.
The Two Rivers again. Everyone said al&rsquo;Thor had turned his
back on his home, but she was not so certain. Why was Gabrelle
watching her?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Last night,&rdquo; Sandomere said after a moment, &ldquo;I
learned that Mishraile is having private lessons from the
M&rsquo;Hael.&rdquo; He stroked his pointed beard with satisfaction, as if
he had produced a gem of great price.</p>

<p>Perhaps he had, but Toveine could not say what kind.
Logain nodded slowly. The others exchanged silent looks with faces
that might have been carved. She chewed frustration, watching. Too
often it was like this, matters they saw no reason to comment on&mdash;or feared to?&mdash;and she did not understand. She always
felt there <em>were</em> gems hidden there, beyond her reach.</p>

<p>A wide Cairhienin fellow, barely as tall as
Logain&rsquo;s chest, opened his mouth, but whether he meant to
speak of Mishraile, whoever he was, she never found out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Logain!&rdquo; Welyn Kajima pounded down the street at a
dead run, the bells at the ends of his black braids jangling.
Another Dedicated, a man in his middle years who smiled too much,
he had been there when Logain captured her, too. Kajima had bonded
Jenare. He was almost out of breath when he pushed through the
other men, and he was not smiling now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Logain,&rdquo; he panted, &ldquo;the M&rsquo;Hael&rsquo;s back
from Cairhien, and he&rsquo;s posted new deserters on the board at
the palace. You won&rsquo;t believe the names!&rdquo; He spilled out his
list in a breathless rush amid exclamations from the other that
kept Toveine from hearing more than fragments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dedicated have deserted before,&rdquo; the Cairhienin
muttered when Kajima was done, &ldquo;but <em>never</em> a full
Asha&rsquo;man. And now seven at once!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t believe me,&rdquo; Kajima began, drawing
himself up in a fussy manner. He had been a clerk, in Arafel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We believe you,&rdquo; Genhald said soothingly. &ldquo;But
Gedwyn and Torval, they are the M&rsquo;Hael&rsquo;s men. Rochaid and
Kisman, too. Why would they desert? He gave them anything a king
could want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kajima shook his head irritably, making his bells
chime. &ldquo;You know the list never gives reasons. Just names.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good riddance,&rdquo; Kurin growled. &ldquo;At least, it would
be if we didn&rsquo;t have to hunt them down, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the others I cannot understand,&rdquo; Sandomere
put in. &ldquo;I was at Dumai&rsquo;s Wells. I saw the Lord Dragon choose,
after. Dashiva had his head in the clouds, like always. But Flinn,
Hopwil, Narishma? You never saw men more pleased. They were like
lambs let loose in the barley shed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A sturdy fellow with gray in his hair spat. &ldquo;Well, I
wasn&rsquo;t at the Wells, but I went south against the Seanchan.&rdquo;
His accents were Andoran. &ldquo;Maybe the lambs didn&rsquo;t like the
butcher&rsquo;s yard as much as they did the barley shed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Logain had been listening without taking part, arms
folded across his chest. His face was unreadable, a mask. &ldquo;Do you
worry about the butcher&rsquo;s yard, Canler?&rdquo; he said now.</p>

<p>The Andoran grimaced, then shrugged. &ldquo;I reckon
we&rsquo;re all headed there, soon or late, Logain. Don&rsquo;t see
we have much choice, but I don&rsquo;t have to grin about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As long as you&rsquo;re there on the day,&rdquo; Logain
said quietly. He addressed the man called Canler, but several of
the others nodded.</p>

<p>Looking past the men, Logain considered Toveine and
Gabrelle. Toveine tried to look as if she had not been
eavesdropping, and remembering names fiercely. &ldquo;Go inside out of
the cold,&rdquo; he told them. &ldquo;Have some tea to warm you. I&rsquo;ll be
back as soon as I can. Don&rsquo;t touch my papers.&rdquo; Gathering up
the other men with a gesture, he led them off in the direction
Kajima had come from.</p>

<p>Toveine gritted her teeth in frustration. At least
she would not have to follow him to the training grounds, past the
so-called Traitor&rsquo;s Tree, where heads hung like diseased fruit
from the bare branches, and watch men studying how to destroy with
the Power, but she had hoped for another day to herself, free to
wander about and see what she could learn. She had heard men speak
of Taim&rsquo;s &ldquo;palace&rdquo; before, and today she had hoped to find it
and perhaps catch a glimpse of the man whose name was as black as
Logain&rsquo;s. Instead, she meekly followed the other woman through
the red door. There was no use in fighting it.</p>

<p>Inside, she looked around the front room while
Gabrelle hung her cloak on a peg. Despite the exterior, she had
expected something grander for Logain. A low fire burned in a rough
stone fireplace. A long narrow table and ladder-backed chairs stood
on bare floorboards. A desk, only slightly more elaborate than the
other furnishings, caught her eye. Stacks of lidded letterboxes
littered the desktop, and leather folders full of long sheets of
paper. Her fingers itched, but she knew that even if she sat at the
desk, she would not be able to lay a finger on anything more than a
pen or glass ink bottle.</p>

<p>With a sigh, she followed Gabrelle into the kitchen,
where an iron stove gave too much heat and dirty breakfast dishes
sat on a low cabinet beneath the window. Gabrelle filled a
teakettle and put it on the stove, then took a green-glazed teapot
and a wooden canister from another cabinet. Toveine draped her
cloak over a chair and sat down at the square table. She did not
want tea unless it came with the breakfast she had missed, but she
knew she was going to drink it.</p>

<p>The silly Brown nattered on as she carried out her
domestic tasks like a contented farmwife. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned a good
deal already. Logain is the only full Asha&rsquo;man to live here in
this village. The others all live in Taim&rsquo;s &lsquo;palace.&rsquo; They have servants, but Logain hired the wife
of a man in training to cook and clean for him. She&rsquo;ll be here
soon, and she thinks he put the sun in the sky, so we best be done
talking anything important by then. He found your lapdesk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toveine felt as though an icy hand had seized her
throat. She tried to hide it, but Gabrelle was looking straight at
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He burned it, Toveine. After reading the contents.
He seemed to think he had done us a favor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hand eased, and Toveine could breathe again.
&ldquo;Elaida&rsquo;s order was among my papers.&rdquo; She cleared her throat
to rid herself of hoarseness. Elaida&rsquo;s order to gentle every
man found here and then hang them on the spot, without the trial in
Tar Valon required by Tower law. &ldquo;She imposed harsh conditions, and
these men would have reacted harshly, if they knew.&rdquo; In spite of
the heat from the stove, she shivered. That single paper could have
gotten them all stilled and hanged. &ldquo;Why would he do us
favors?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why, Toveine. He isn&rsquo;t a
villain, no more than most men. It could be as simple as that.&rdquo;
Gabrelle set a plate of crusted rolls and another with white cheese
on the table. &ldquo;Or it could be that this bond is like the Warder
bond in more ways than we know. Maybe he just did not want to
experience the two of us executed.&rdquo; Toveine&rsquo;s stomach rumbled,
but she picked up a roll as if she did not care for more than a
nibble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suspect &lsquo;harsh&rsquo; was a mild choice,&rdquo;
Gabrelle went on, spooning tea into the teapot. &ldquo;I saw you flinch.
Of course, they went to a great deal of trouble to bring us here.
Fifty-one sisters in their midst, and even with the bond, they must
fear we&rsquo;ll find some way around their orders, some loophole
they missed. The obvious answer is, if we were dead, the Tower
would be roused to fury. With us alive and captive, even Elaida
will move cautiously.&rdquo; She laughed, quietly amused. &ldquo;Your face,
Toveine. Did you think I&rsquo;ve spent all my time thinking about
tangling my fingers in Logain&rsquo;s hair?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toveine closed her mouth and put down the untouched
roll. It was cold, anyway, and felt hard. Always a mistake to
assume Browns were unworldly, absorbed in their books and studies
to the exclusion of everything else. &ldquo;What else have you seen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still gripping the spoon, Gabrelle sat across the
table from her and leaned forward intently. &ldquo;Their wall maybe
strong when it&rsquo;s done, but this place is full of fractures.
There is Mazrim Taim&rsquo;s faction, and Logain&rsquo;s faction,
though I am uncertain either thinks of them so. Perhaps other
factions, too, and certainly men who don&rsquo;t know there are
factions. Fifty-one sisters should be able to make something of
that, even with the bond. The second question is, what <em>do</em>
we make of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The second question?&rdquo; Toveine demanded, but the
other woman merely waited. &ldquo;If we manage to break those fissures
open,&rdquo; she said finally, &ldquo;we scatter ten or fifty or a hundred
bands across the world, each more dangerous than any army ever
seen. Catching them all might take a lifetime and rip the world
apart like a new Breaking, and that with Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don on its
way. That is, if this fellow al&rsquo;Thor really is the Dragon
Reborn.&rdquo; Gabrelle opened her mouth, but Toveine waved away whatever
she was going to say. That he was, very likely. It hardly mattered,
here and now. &ldquo;But if we don&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Put down the rebellion
and gather those sisters back to the Tower, call back every retired
sister, and I don&rsquo;t know whether all of us together could
destroy this place. I suspect half the tower would die in the
attempt, either way. What was the first question?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gabrelle leaned back in her chair, her face suddenly
weary. &ldquo;Yes, not an easy decision. And they bring in more men every
day. Fifteen or twenty since we&rsquo;ve been here, I believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be trifled with, Gabrelle! What is the
first question?&rdquo; The Brown&rsquo;s gaze sharpened, stared at her for
a long moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soon, the shock will wear off,&rdquo; she said finally.
&ldquo;What comes then? The authority Elaida gave you is finished, the
expedition is finished. The first question is, are we fifty-one
sisters united, or do we revert to being Browns and Reds, Yellows
and Greens and Grays? And poor Ayako, who must be regretting that
the Whites insisted on having a sister included. Lemai and Desandre
stand highest among us.&rdquo; Gabrelle waved the spoon in admonishment.
&ldquo;The only chance we have of holding together is if you and I
publicly submit to Desandre&rsquo;s authority. We must! That will
start it, at any rate. I hope. If we can only bring a few others,
to begin with, it will be a start.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toveine drew a deep breath and pretended to stare at
nothing, as if considering. Submitting to a sister who stood higher
than she was no hardship, in itself. The Ajahs had always kept
secrets, and sometimes schemed a little against one another, but
the open dissension in the Tower now appalled her. Besides, she had
learned how to be humble before Mistress Doweel. She wondered how
the woman enjoyed poverty, and working on a farm for a taskmistress
even harsher than herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can bring myself to do it,&rdquo; she said finally. &ldquo;We
should have a plan of action to present to Desandre and Lemai, if
we mean to convince them.&rdquo; She already had one partly formed, if
not for presentation to anyone. &ldquo;Oh, the water is boiling,
Gabrelle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly smiling, the foolish woman rose and hurried
to the stove. Browns always were better reading books than people,
come to think of it. Before Logain and Taim and the rest were
destroyed, they would help Toveine Gazal bring down Elaida.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The great city of Cairhien was a hulking mass inside
massive walls, crowding the River Alguenya. The sky was clear and
cloudless, but a cold wind blew and the sun shone on roofs covered
with snow, glinted on icicles that showed no sign of melting. The
Alguenya was not frozen, but small, jagged ice floes from farther
upriver spun in the currents, now and then banging against the
hulls of ships waiting their turns at the docks. Trade slowed for
winter and wars, and the Dragon Reborn, but it never really
stopped, not until nations died. Despite the cold, wagons and carts
and people flowed along streets that razored the terraced hills of
the city. The City, it was called here.</p>

<p>In front of the square-towered Sun Palace, a crowd
jammed together around the long entry ramp and stared up, merchants
wrapped in fine woolens and nobles in velvets rubbing shoulders
with grimy-faced laborers and dirtier refugees. No one cared who
stood next to him, and even the cutpurses forgot to follow their
trade. Men and women departed, often shaking their heads, but
others took their places, sometimes hoisting a child to get a
better view of the Palace&rsquo;s ruined wing, where workmen were
clearing away the rubble of the third story. Throughout the rest of
Cairhien, craftsmen&rsquo;s hammers and creaking axles filled the
air, together with the cries of shopkeepers, the complaints of
buyers, the murmurs of merchants. The crowd before the Sun Palace
was silent.</p>

<p>A mile from the Palace, Rand stood at a window in the
grandly named Academy of Cairhien, peering through the frosted
panes at the stone-paved stableyard below. There had been schools
called Academies in Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s time and before, centers
of learning filled with scholars from every corner of the known
world. The conceit made no difference, they could have called it
the Barn, so long as it did what he wanted. More important concerns
filled his thoughts. Had he made a mistake, returning to Cairhien
so soon? But he had been forced to flee too quickly, so it would be
known in the right quarters that he actually had fled. Too quickly
to prepare everything. There were questions he needed to ask, and
tasks that could not be put off. And Min wanted more of Master
Fel&rsquo;s books. He could hear her muttering to herself as she
rummaged through the shelves where they had been stored after
Fel&rsquo;s death. With the bounty for books and manuscripts it did
not yet possess, the Academy&rsquo;s library was fast outgrowing the
rooms that could be spared in Lord Barthanes&rsquo; former palace.
Alanna sat in the back of his head, sulking it seemed; she would
know he was in the City. This near, she would be able to walk
straight to him, but he would know if she tried. Blessedly, Lews
Therin was silent for the moment. Of late, the man seemed madder
than ever.</p>

<p>He rubbed a spot clear on a windowpane with his coat
sleeve. Stout dark gray wool, good enough for a man with a little
money and a few airs, it was not a garment anyone would expect to
see on the Dragon Reborn. The golden-maned Dragon&rsquo;s head on
the back of his hand glittered metallically; it presented no danger
here. His boot touched the leather scrip sitting below the window
as he leaned forward to look out.</p>

<p>In the stableyard, the paving stones had been swept
clear of snow, and a large wagon stood surrounded by buckets like
mushrooms in a clearing. Half a dozen men in heavy coats and
scarves and caps seemed to be working on the wagon&rsquo;s odd
cargo, mechanical devices crowded around a fat metal cylinder that
took up more than half the wagon bed. Even stranger, the wagon
shafts were missing. One of the men was moving split firewood from
a large wheelbarrow into the side of a metal box fastened below one
end of the big cylinder. The open door in the box glowed with the
red of fire inside, and smoke rose from a tall narrow chimney.
Another fellow danced around the wagon, bearded, capless and
bald-headed, gesturing and apparently shouting orders that did not
seem to make the others move any faster. Their breath made faint
white plumes. It was almost warm inside; the Academy had large
furnaces in the cellars and an extensive system of vents. The
half-healed, never healing wounds in his side were hot.</p>

<p>He could not make out Min&rsquo;s curses&mdash;he was
sure they were curses&mdash;but her tone was enough to say they
would not be leaving yet unless he dragged her away. There were one
or two items he might ask about still. &ldquo;What are people saying?
About the palace?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you might expect,&rdquo; Lord Dobraine answered
behind him with level patience, as he had answered all the other
questions. Even when he admitted a lack of knowledge, his tone had
not changed. &ldquo;Some say the Forsaken attacked you, or that Aes Sedai
did. Those who think you swore fealty to the Amyrlin Seat favor the
Forsaken. Either way, there is considerable debate on whether you
are dead or kidnapped, or fled. Most believe you live, wherever you
are, or say they do. Some, a good many I fear, think&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; His
voice faded to silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I&rsquo;ve gone mad,&rdquo; Rand finished for him in
the same level tone. Not a matter for concern, or anger. &ldquo;That I
destroyed part of the Palace myself?&rdquo; He would not speak of the
dead. Fewer than other times, other places, but enough, and some of
their names appeared whenever he closed his eyes. One of the men
below climbed down from the wagon, but the bald fellow caught his
arm and dragged him back up, making him show what he had done. A
man on the other side jumped on the pavement carelessly, skidding,
and the capless man abandoned the first to chase around the wagon
and make that one climb back up with him. What in the Light could
they be doing? Rand glanced over his shoulder. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not
far wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dobraine Taborwin, a short man with the front of his
head shaved and formally powdered and the rest of his hair nearly
all gray, looked back with dark impassive eyes. Not a handsome man,
but steady. Blue-and-white stripes marched down the front of his
dark velvet coat from his neck almost to his knees. His signet ring
was a carved ruby, and he wore another at his collar, not much
larger yet flamboyant for a Cairhienin. He was High Seat of his
House, with more battles behind him than most, and not much
frightened him. He had proved that at Dumai&rsquo;s Wells.</p>

<p>But then, the stocky, graying woman patiently waiting
her turn at his shoulder appeared just as unafraid. In sharp
contrast to Dobraine&rsquo;s noble elegance, Idrien Tarsin&rsquo;s
sensible brown woolens were plain enough for a shopkeeper, yet she
had her own well of authority and dignity. Idrien was Headmistress
of the Academy, the title she had been given herself since most of
the scholars and mechanics called themselves master of this or
mistress of that. She ran the school with a strong hand and
believed in practical things, new methods of surfacing roads or
making dyes, improvements to foundries and mills. She also believed
in the Dragon Reborn. Whether or not that was practical, it was
pragmatic, and he would settle for that.</p>

<p>He turned to the window and cleared his patch on the
glass again. Maybe it was for heating water&mdash;some of those
buckets seemed to have water in them still; in Shienar, they used
big boilers to heat water for the baths&mdash;but why on a wagon?
&ldquo;Has anyone left suddenly since I went? Or come unexpectedly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not expect that anyone had, anyone of
importance to him. Between merchant&rsquo;s pigeons and White Tower
eyes-and-ears&mdash;and Mazrim Taim; he must not forget Taim; Lews
Therin snarled wordlessly at the name&mdash;with all those pigeons
and spies and babbling tongues, in a few more days the whole world
would be aware that he had vanished from Cairhien. All the world
that mattered, here and now. Cairhien was no longer the ground
where the battle would be fought. Dobraine&rsquo;s answer surprised
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one except&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Ailil Riatin and some high Sea
Folk official are both missing since the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;attack.&rdquo; A bare
pause, but a pause. Perhaps he was not so sure what had happened,
either. Yet he would keep his word. He had proved that at
Dumai&rsquo;s Wells, too. &ldquo;No bodies were found, but they may have
been killed. The Sea Folk Wavemistress refuses to countenance the
possibility, though. She is raising a storm with demands that her
woman be produced. In truth, Ailil may have fled to the
countryside. Or gone to join her brother, despite her pledges to
you. Your three Asha&rsquo;man are still in the Sun Palace. Flinn,
Narishma and Hopwil. They make people nervous. More so now than
before.&rdquo; The Headmistress made a sound in her throat, and her shoes
shifted audibly on the floorboards. They certainly made her
nervous.</p>

<p>Rand dismissed the Asha&rsquo;man. Unless much closer
than the Palace, none was strong enough to have felt him open a
gateway here. Those three had not been part of the attack on him,
but a wise planner might have considered the chance of failure.
Planned how to keep someone close to him if he survived. <em>You
won&rsquo;t survive</em>, Lews Therin whispered. <em>None of us will
survive</em>.</p>

<p><em>Go back to sleep</em>, Rand thought irritably. He
knew he was not going to survive. But he wanted to. A derisive
laugh answered in his head, but the sound thinned and was gone. The
bald man was letting the others climb down, now, and rubbing his
hands together in a pleased fashion. Of all things, the fellow
seemed to be giving a speech!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ailil and Shalon are alive, and they didn&rsquo;t
flee,&rdquo; Rand said out loud. He had left them bound and gagged,
stuffed under a bed, where they would have been found by servants
in a few hours, though the shield he had woven on that Sea Folk
Windfinder should have dissipated before that. The two women should
have been able to free themselves then. &ldquo;Look to Cadsuane.
She&rsquo;ll have them in Lady Arilyn&rsquo;s palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cadsuane Sedai is in and out of the Sun Palace as if
it were her own,&rdquo; Dobraine said judiciously, &ldquo;but how could she
have taken them out unseen? And why? Ailil is Toram&rsquo;s sister,
yet his claim to the Sun Throne is dust now, if it was ever more.
She is unimportant even as a counter, now. As for holding an
Atha&rsquo;an Miere of high rank&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;To what purpose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand made his voice light, uncaring. &ldquo;Why is she
keeping Lady Caraline and High Lord Darlin as &lsquo;guests,&rsquo;
Dobraine? Why do Aes Sedai do anything? You&rsquo;ll find them where
I said. If she lets you in to look.&rdquo; Why was not a foolish
question. He just did not have the answer. Of course, Caraline
Damodred and Ailil Riatin did represent the last two Houses to hold
the Sun Throne. And Darlin Sisnera led the nobles in Tear who
wanted him thrown out of their precious Stone, out of Tear.</p>

<p>Rand frowned. He had been sure Cadsuane was focused
on him despite her pretense otherwise, but what if it was not
pretense? A relief, if so. Of course it was. The last thing he
needed was an Aes Sedai who thought she could meddle in his affairs.
The very last. Perhaps Cadsuane was directing her meddling
elsewhere. Min had seen Sisnera wearing a strange crown; Rand had
thought a great deal on that viewing of hers. He did not want to
think of other things she had seen, concerning himself and the
Green sister. Could it be as simple as Cadsuane thinking she could
decide who would rule both Tear and Cairhien?</p>

<p>Simple? He almost laughed. But that was how Aes Sedai
behaved. And Shalon, the Windfinder? Possessing her might give
Cadsuane leverage with Harine, the Wavemistress, but he suspected
she had just been scooped up with Ailil, to try hiding who took the
noblewoman. Cadsuane would have to be disabused. Who would rule in
Tear and Cairhien had already been decided. He would point that out
to her. Later. It stood far down his list of priorities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before I go, Dobraine, I need to give you&mdash;&rdquo;
Words froze on his tongue.</p>

<p>In the stableyard, the capless man had pulled a lever
on the wagon, and one end of a long horizontal beam suddenly rose,
then sank, driving a shorter beam down through a hole cut in the
wagon bed. And, vibrating till it seemed ready to shake apart,
trailing smoke from the chimney, the wagon lurched ahead, the beam
rising and falling, slowly at first, then faster. It moved, without
horses!</p>

<p>He did not realize he had spoken aloud until the
Headmistress answered him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that! That&rsquo;s Mervin Poel&rsquo;s steamwagon,
as he calls it, my Lord Dragon.&rdquo; Disapproval freighted her high,
startling youthful voice. &ldquo;Claims he can pull a hundred wagons with
the contraption. Not unless he can make it go further than fifty
paces without bits breaking or freezing up. It has only done that
far once, that I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed, the&mdash;steamwagon?&mdash;shuddered to a
halt not twenty paces from where it first stood. Shuddered indeed;
it seemed to be shaking harder by the heartbeat. Most of the men
swarmed over it again, one of them frantically twisting at
something with a cloth wrapped around his hand. Abruptly steam shot
into the air from a pipe, and the shuddering slowed, stopped.</p>

<p>Rand shook his head. He remembered seeing this fellow
Mervin, with a device that quivered on a tabletop and did nothing.
And this marvel had come from that? He had thought it was meant to
make music. That must be Mervin leaping about and shaking his fists
and the others. What other odd things, what marvels, were people
building here at the Academy?</p>

<p>When he asked, still watching the men in the
courtyard work on the wagon, Idrien sniffed loudly. Respect for the
Dragon Reborn held only a thin edge in her voice as she began, and
quickly lost ground to disgust. &ldquo;Bad enough I must give space to
philosophers and historians and arithmatists and the like, but you
said take in anyone who wanted to make anything new and let them
stay if they showed progress. I suppose you hoped for weapons, but
now I have dozens of dreamers and wastrels on my hands, every one
with an old book or manuscript or six, <em>all</em> of which date
back to the Compact of the Ten Nations, mind, if not the Age of
Legends itself, or so they say, and they are all trying to make
sense of drawings and sketches and descriptions of things
they&rsquo;ve never seen and maybe nobody ever did see. <em>I</em>
have seen old manuscripts that talk about people with their eyes in
their bellies, and animals ten feet tall with tusks longer than a
man, and cities where&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what are they making, Headmistress Tarsin?&rdquo; Rand
demanded. The men working on the thing below moved with an air of
purpose, not as if they saw failure. And it had moved.</p>

<p>She sniffed louder this time. &ldquo;Foolishness, my Lord
Dragon, that is what they make. Kin Tovere constructed his big
looking glass. You can see the moon through it plain as your hand,
and what he claims are other worlds, but what is the good of that?
He wants to build a bigger, now. Maryl Harke makes huge kites she
calls gliders, and come spring, she will be throwing herself off
hills again. Puts your heart in your mouth to see her sailing
downhill on the things; she will break more than her arm next time
one folds up on her, I warrant. Jander Parentakis believes he can
move riverboats with waterwheels off a mill, or near enough, but
when he put enough men into the boat to turn the cranks, there was
no room for cargo, and any craft with sails could outrun it. Ryn
Anhara traps lightning in big jars&mdash;I doubt even he knows why&mdash;Niko Tokama is just as silly with her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand spun around so fast that she stepped back, and
even Dobraine shifted on his feet, a swordman&rsquo;s move. No, they
were not sure of him at all. &ldquo;He traps lightning?&rdquo; he asked
quietly.</p>

<p>Comprehension flooded her blunt face, and she waved
her hands in front of her. &ldquo;No, no! Not like&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;like that!&rdquo; Not
like you, she had almost said. &ldquo;It is a thing of wires and wheels
and big clay jars and the Light knows what. He calls it lightning,
and I saw a rat jump down on one of the jars once, on the metal
rods sticking out of the top. It certainly looked struck by
lightning.&rdquo; A hopeful tone entered her voice. &ldquo;I can make him stop,
if you wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He tried to picture someone riding on a kite, but the
image was ludicrous. Catching lightning in jars was beyond his
ability to imagine. And yet&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;Let them go on as before,
Headmistress. Who knows? Maybe one of these inventions will turn
out to be important. If any work as claimed, give the inventor a
reward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dobraine&rsquo;s leathery, sun-darkened face looked
dubious, though he almost managed to conceal it. Idrien bowed her
head in sullen assent, and even curtsied, but plainly she thought
he was asking to let pigs fly if they could.</p>

<p>Rand was not certain he disagreed. Then again, maybe
one of the pigs <em>would</em> grow wings. The wagon <em>had</em>
moved. He wanted very badly to leave something behind, something to
help the world survive the new Breaking the Prophecies said he
would bring. The trouble was, he had no idea what that might be,
save for the schools themselves. Who knew what a marvel could do?
Light, he wanted to build <em>something</em> that could last.</p>

<p><em>I thought I could build</em>, Lews Therin
murmured in his head. <em>I was wrong. We are not builders, not
you, or I, or the other one. We are destroyers.
Destroyers</em>.</p>

<p>Rand shivered, and scrubbed his hands through his
hair. The other one? At times, the voice sounded sanest when it was
the most mad. They were watching him, Dobraine very nearly hiding
uncertainty, Idrien making no effort to. Straightening as if
nothing was wrong, he drew two slim packets from inside his coat.
Both carried the Dragon in a long lump of red wax on the outside.
The belt buckle he was not wearing at the moment served for an
impressive signet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The top one names you my steward in Cairhien,&rdquo; he
said, handing the packets to Dobraine. A third still nestled next
to his chest, for Gregorin den Lushenos, making him steward in
Illian. &ldquo;So there&rsquo;ll be no trouble with anyone questioning
your authority while I&rsquo;m gone.&rdquo; Dobraine could handle that
sort of trouble with his armsmen, but best to make sure no one
could claim ignorance or doubt. Maybe there would be no trouble to
handle if everyone believed the Dragon Reborn would descend on
transgressors. &ldquo;There are orders about things I want done, but
aside from those, use your own judgment. When the Lady Elayne lays
claim to the Sun Throne, throw your full support behind her.&rdquo;
Elayne. Oh, Light, Elayne, and Aviendha. At least they were safe.
Min&rsquo;s voice sounded happier, now; she must have found Master
Fel&rsquo;s books. He was going to let her follow him to her death
because he was not strong enough to stop her. <em>Ilyena</em>, Lews
Therin moaned. <em>Forgive me, Ilyena!</em> Rand&rsquo;s voice came
out as cold as winter&rsquo;s heart. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know when to
deliver the other. Whether to deliver it. Pry him out if need be,
and decide by what he says. If you decide no, or he refuses,
I&rsquo;ll pick someone else. Not you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps that was brusque, but Dobraine&rsquo;s
expression hardly changed. His eyebrows rose slightly at the name
written on the second packet; that was all. He made a smooth bow.
Cairhienin usually were smooth. &ldquo;It shall be as you say. Forgive
me, but you sound as though you mean to be gone for a long
while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shrugged. He trusted the High Lord as far as he
trusted anyone. Almost as far. &ldquo;Who can say? The times are
uncertain. Make sure Headmistress Tarsin has whatever coin she
needs, and the men starting the school in Caemlyn. The school in
Tear, as well, until matters change there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you say,&rdquo; Dobraine repeated, tucking the packets
into his coat. His face betrayed no emotion, now. An experienced
player in the Game of House, was Dobraine.</p>

<p>For her part, the Headmistress managed to look
pleased and disgruntled at the same time, and busied herself
smoothing her dress unnecessarily the way women did when
hard-pressed not to speak their minds. Complain how she would about
dreamers and philosophers, she was jealous of the Academy&rsquo;s
well-being. She would shed no tears if those other schools
vanished and their scholars were forced to come to the Academy.
Even the philosophers. What would she think of one particular order
in Dobraine&rsquo;s packet?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found everything I need,&rdquo; Min said, coming
out from the shelves staggering slightly under the weight of the
three bulging cloth scrips that hung from her. Her plain brown coat
and breeches were very like what she had worn when he first saw her
in Baerlon. For some reason, she had grumbled over them until
anyone who knew her would have thought he was asking her to put on
a dress. She smiled now, though, with delight and a hint of
mischief. &ldquo;I hope those packhorses are where we left them, or my
Lord Dragon will have to be fitted for a packsaddle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Idrien, gasped, scandalized to hear him addressed so,
but Dobraine merely smiled a little. He had seen Min around Rand
before.</p>

<p>Rand got rid of them as quickly as possible then,
since they had heard and seen as much as he wanted them to&mdash;sent them off with a final admonition that he had never been there
at all. Dobraine nodded as if he had expected no less. Idrien
looked thoughtful as she left. If she let anything slip where a
servant could hear, or a scholar, it would be all over the City in
two days. There was not much time in any case. Perhaps no one who
could tell had been close enough to feel him open a gateway here,
but anyone looking for signs would be sure by now there was a
<em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> in the city. It was not his plan to be found
yet.</p>

<p>When the door closed behind them, he studied Min for
a moment, then took one of the scrips and slung it from his
shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only one?&rdquo; she said. Setting the others on the
floor, she planted her fists on her hips and scowled. &ldquo;Sometimes
you really are a sheepherder. These bags must be a hundredweight
each.&rdquo; But she sounded more amused than upset.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have picked smaller books, &ldquo; he told her,
pulling on riding gloves to hide the Dragons. &ldquo;Or lighter.&rdquo; He
turned toward the window, to fetch the leather scrip, and a wave of
dizziness hit him. Knees turning to water, he stumbled. A
shimmering face he could not make out flashed through his head.
With an effort, he caught himself, forced his legs straight. And
the whirling sensation vanished. Lews Therin panted hoarsely in the
shadows. Could the face be his?</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you think you&rsquo;ll make me carry them all that
way, think again,&rdquo; Min grumbled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen better pretending
from stablehands. You could try falling down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not this time.&rdquo; He was ready for what happened when
he channeled; he could control it to some extent. Usually. Most of
the time. This dizziness without <em>saidin</em> was new. Maybe he
had just turned too fast. And maybe pigs <em>did</em> fly. He
settled the leather scrip&rsquo;s strap over his free shoulder. The
men in the stableyard were still busy. Building. &ldquo;Min&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her brows lowered immediately. She paused for an
instant in drawing on her red gloves and began tapping her foot. A
dangerous sign with any woman, especially one who carried knives.
&ldquo;We had this out, Rand bloody Dragon al&rsquo;Thor! You are
<em>not</em> leaving me behind!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The thought never crossed my mind,&rdquo; he lied. He was
too weak; he could not make himself say the words, to make her
stay. <em>Too weak</em>, he thought bitterly, <em>and she might
well die for it, the Light burn me forever!</em></p>

<p><em>It will</em>, Lews Therin promised softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just thought you should know what we&rsquo;ve been
doing, and what we are going to do,&rdquo; Rand went on. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
been very forthcoming, I suppose.&rdquo; Gathering himself, he seized
<em>saidin</em>. The room seemed to whirl, and he rode the
avalanche of fire and ice and filth with nausea seething in his
belly. He was able to stand erect without swaying, though. Barely.
And just able to weave the flows of a gateway that opened into a
snowy clearing where two saddled horses were tethered to a low
branch of an oak.</p>

<p>He was glad to see the animals still there. The
clearing was well away from the nearest road, but there were still
wanderers who had turned their backs on families and farms, trades
and crafts, because the Dragon Reborn had broken all bonds. The
Prophecies said so. On the other hand, a good many of those men and
women, footsore and half-frozen now on top of it, were tired of
searching without any notion what they were searching for. Even
these nondescript mounts surely would have vanished with the first
man to find them unattended. He had gold enough to buy others, but
he did not think Min would have enjoyed the hour&rsquo;s walk to the
village where they had left the packhorses.</p>

<p>Hurrying through into the clearing, pretending the
change from floor to knee-deep snow caused his stumble, he only
waited until she had snatched up her bags of books and staggered
through after him before releasing the Power. They were five
hundred miles from Cairhien, and nearer Tar Valon than anywhere
else of note. Alanna had faded in his head when the gateway
closed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forthcoming?&rdquo; Min said, sounding suspicious. Of all
his motives, he hoped, or anything but the truth. The dizziness and
nausea faded slowly. &ldquo;You have been as open as a mussel, Rand, but
I am not blind. First we Traveled to Rhuidean, where you asked so
many questions about this Shara place that anyone would think you
meant to go there.&rdquo; Frowning faintly, she shook her head as she
fastened one of her burdens to the saddle of her brown gelding. She
grunted with the effort, but she was not about to set the other bag
of books down in the snow. &ldquo;I never thought the Aiel Waste was like
that. That city is bigger than Tar Valon, even if it is half
ruined. And all those fountains, and the lake. I couldn&rsquo;t even
see the far side. I thought there wasn&rsquo;t any water in the
Waste. And it was as cold as here; I thought the waste was
hot!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In summer, you fry during the day, but you still
freeze at night.&rdquo; He felt recovered enough to begin shifting his
own burdens to the gray&rsquo;s saddle. Almost enough. He did it
anyway. &ldquo;If you already know everything, what was I doing besides
asking questions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The same as in Tear last night. Making sure every
cat and blackbird knew you were there. In Tear, it was Chachin you
asked about. It&rsquo;s obvious. You are trying to confuse anyone
who tries to find out where you are and where you&rsquo;re going
next.&rdquo; The second bag of books balancing the first behind her
saddle, she untied her reins and climbed into the saddle. &ldquo;So, am I
blind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your eyes belong on an eagle.&rdquo; He hoped his pursuers
saw as clearly. Or that whoever directed them did. It would not do
to have them haring off the Light knew where. &ldquo;I need to lay some
more false trails, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why take the time? I know you have a plan, I know it
concerns something in that leather scrip&mdash;a
<em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>&mdash;and I know it&rsquo;s important.
Don&rsquo;t look so surprised. You barely let that bag out of your
sight. Why not go ahead and do whatever it is your plan,
<em>then</em> lay your false trails? And the real one, of course.
You&rsquo;re going to turn on them when they least expect, you said.
You can hardly do that unless they follow where you want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d never started reading Herid
Fel&rsquo;s books,&rdquo; he muttered sourly, pulling himself into the
gray&rsquo;s saddle. His head spun only a little. &ldquo;You puzzle out
too much. Can I keep any secrets at all from you, now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never could, woolhead,&rdquo; she laughed, and then,
contradicting herself, &ldquo;What <em>are</em> you planning? Aside from
killing Dashiva and the rest, I mean. I have a right to know if
I&rsquo;m traveling with you.&rdquo; As if she had not insisted on
traveling with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to cleanse the male half of the
source,&rdquo; he said in a flat voice. A momentous announcement. A grand
scheme, more than grand. Grandiose, most would say. He might have
said he intended to take an afternoon stroll, for all of Min&rsquo;s
reaction. She simply looked at him, hands folded on the pommel of
her saddle, until he went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how long it will take, and once I
start, I think everyone within a thousand miles of me who can
channel will know something is happening. I doubt I&rsquo;ll be able
to just stop if Dashiva and the rest, or the Forsaken, suddenly
appear to see what it is. The Forsaken, I can&rsquo;t do anything
about, but with luck, I can finish the others.&rdquo; Maybe being
<em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> would give him the edge he needed so
desperately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Depend on luck, and Corlan Dashiva or the Forsaken,
either one will have you for breakfast,&rdquo; she said, turning her
horse out of the clearing. &ldquo;Maybe I can think of a better way. Come
on. There&rsquo;s a warm fire at the inn. I hope you&rsquo;re going
to let us have a hot meal before we leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stared after her incredulously. You would have
thought five renegade Asha&rsquo;man, not to mention the Forsaken,
were less bother than a sore tooth. Booting the gray ahead in a
spray of snow, he caught up to her and rode in silence. He still
had a few secrets from her, this sickness that had begun affecting
him when he channeled, for one. That was the real reason he had to
deal with Dashiva and the others first. It gave him time to get
over the sickness. If that was possible. If not, he was not sure
the two <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> riding behind his saddle were
going to be any use at all.</p>
