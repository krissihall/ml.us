<h4><em>To Surprise Queens and Kings</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t
was not quite so simple as just saying she would
go, of course.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is unwise, sister,&rdquo; Aviendha said darkly as
Merilille scurried off to freshen herself. Scurried in truth; the
Gray seemed to be keeping a sharp eye out for Sea Folk before she
reached the sitting room doors. When a sister of Elayne&rsquo;s
standing said go, Merilille went. Arms folded and shawl wrapped
around her so she looked very much the Wise One, Aviendha stood
over Elayne at her writing table. &ldquo;This is very unwise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wise?&rdquo; Birgitte growled, feet apart and fists
planted on her hips. &ldquo;Wise? The girl wouldn&rsquo;t know &lsquo;wise&rsquo; if it bit her on the nose! Why this rush? Let
Merilille do what Grays do, arrange a parley in a few days, or a
week. Queens hate being surprised, and kings despise it. Believe
me, I know it to my cost. They find ways to make you regret it.&rdquo;
The Warder bond mirrored her anger and frustration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>want</em> to catch them by surprise, Birgitte.
It might help me to find out just how much they know about me.&rdquo;
Grimacing, Elayne pushed away the blotted page and took another
sheet from the inlaid rosewood paper-box. Her weariness had
vanished with Merilille&rsquo;s news, but writing a steady, clean
hand did seem difficult. The wording needed to be just right, too.
This was not to be a letter from the Daughter-Heir of Andor, but
from Elayne Trakand, Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah. They had to see
what she wanted them to see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try to talk some bloody sense into her, Aviendha,&rdquo;
Birgitte muttered. &ldquo;In case you can&rsquo;t, I had best see if I can
scrape together a suitable flaming escort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No escort, Birgitte. Except for you. An Aes Sedai
and her Warder. And Aviendha, of course.&rdquo; Elayne paused in writing
to smile at her sister, who did not smile back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know your courage, Elayne,&rdquo; Aviendha said. &ldquo;I
admire your courage. But even <em>Sha&rsquo;mad Conde</em> know when
to be cautious!&rdquo; <em>She</em> spoke of caution? Aviendha would not
know caution if&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;if it bit her on the nose!</p>

<p>&ldquo;An Aes Sedai and her Warder?&rdquo; Birgitte exclaimed. &ldquo;I
told you, you can&rsquo;t go running off trying to have adventures
any more!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No escort,&rdquo; Elayne said firmly, dipping her pen for
another try. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t an adventure. It is just the way it
must be done.&rdquo; Throwing up her hands, Birgitte growled several
oaths, but nothing Elayne had not heard before.</p>

<p>To her surprise, Mellar made no objection to staying
behind. A meeting with four rulers would hardly be as boring as
meeting merchants, but he begged leave to be about his duties since
she did not need him. That contented her. A Captain of the Royal
Guards would make the Borderlanders think of her as Daughter-Heir
sooner than she wanted. Not to mention that Mellar might decide to
leer at her.</p>

<p>Captain Mellar&rsquo;s unconcern was not shared by the
rest of her bodyguard, though. One of the Guardswomen apparently
went running for Caseille, because the tall Arafellin woman came
striding into the sitting room while Elayne was still writing,
demanding to accompany Elayne with the entire bodyguard. Birgitte
finally had to order her out to stop her protests.</p>

<p>For once, Birgitte appeared to recognize the fact
that Elayne was not going to be budged, leaving with Caseille to
change her clothes. Well, she stalked off grumbling oaths, slamming
the door behind her with a crash, but at least she did go. You
might have thought she would be happy for a chance to take off that
Captain-General&rsquo;s coat, but the bond might as well have been
an echo of her curses. Aviendha did not curse, but she kept up her
admonitions. Everything had to be done in such a whirlwind, though,
that Elayne had an excuse to ignore them.</p>

<p>Essande was summoned and began laying out suitable
garments, while Elayne hastily ate her midday meal early. She had
not sent for it; Aviendha had. Apparently, Monaelle said missing
meals was as bad as eating too much. Mistress Harfor, informed that
she would have to handle the glassmakers, and the other delegations
as well, grimaced faintly even as she inclined her head in
acceptance. Before leaving, she announced that she had acquired
goats for the Palace. Elayne needed to drink goat&rsquo;s milk, and
lots of it. Careane groaned at hearing that she was to teach the
Windfinders that night, but at least the woman made no comment on
her diet. In truth, she hoped to be back in the Palace by
nightfall, but she also expected to be as tired as if she had
already taught that lesson. Vandene did not offer advice, either,
not of that sort. Elayne had studied the nations of the
Blightborder along with every other land as part of her education,
and had discussed her intentions with the white-haired Green, who
knew the Borderlands well, yet she would have dearly loved to take
Vandene along. Someone who had actually lived in the Borderlands
might see nuances that escaped her. But she did not dare do more
than ask a few last hurried questions while Essande was dressing
her, just to reassure herself on things Vandene had already told
her. Not that she needed reassurance, she realized. She felt as
focused as Birgitte drawing a bow.</p>

<p>Finally, Reanne had to be brought from where she was
yet again trying to convince a former <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> that
she, too, could channel. Reanne had been making that weave in the
stableyard every day since she first wove it to send Merilille off;
she could open it on the same spot in Braem Wood with no
difficulty. There were no maps of that area in the Palace that were
good enough for Merilille to mark the camp&rsquo;s positions very
well, and if Elayne or Aviendha wove the gateway, it might open ten
miles or more farther from the camps than the small clearing Reanne
knew. The snow had stopped falling in Braem Wood before the Gray
returned, yet even so, ten miles in fresh snow could mean another
two hours at best. Elayne wanted this done quickly. Speed. Everyone
had to move with speed.</p>

<p>The Sea Folk must have been aware of the bustle that
enveloped the Palace, Guardswomen running through the hallways
carrying messages and fetching this person or that, but Elayne made
sure they were told nothing. Suppose Zaida decided to come along,
she was capable of having one of the Windfinders make her own
gateway if Elayne refused her, and the Wavemistress was a
complication to be avoided. The woman already behaved as though she
had as much right in the Palace as Elayne herself. Zaida trying to
domineer could ruin everything as surely as Mellar leering at
her.</p>

<p>Making haste seemed beyond Essande&rsquo;s ability,
yet everyone else flew, and by the time the sun stood straight
overhead, Elayne found herself riding Fireheart slowly through the
snows of Braem Wood, near enough fifty leagues north of Caemlyn as
the wild goose flew but only a step through the gateway into thick
forest of tall pine and leatherleaf and oak mixed with
gray-branched trees that had lost their leaves. Occasionally a
broad meadow opened up, covered with snow like white carpets,
unblemished save for the hoofprints of Merilille&rsquo;s running
horse. Merilille had been sent ahead with the letter, and Elayne,
Aviendha and Birgitte had followed after an hour, to give her time
to reach the Borderlanders ahead of them. The road from Caemlyn to
New Braem lay some miles to the west. Here, they could have been a
thousand leagues from human habitation.</p>

<p>For Elayne, dressing had been as serious as choosing
armor. Her cloak was lined with marten for added warmth, but the
material was dark green wool, soft yet thick, and her riding dress
was green silk, and unadorned. Even her snug riding gloves were
plain dark green leather. Unless the swords had been drawn, that
was the armor in which an Aes Sedai faced rulers. Her only visible
jewelry was a small amber brooch in the shape of a turtle, and if
anyone thought that odd, let them. An army of Borderlanders was
beyond any trap one of her rivals could lay, or even Elaida, but
those ten sisters&mdash;ten or more&mdash;might be Elaida&rsquo;s.
She was not about to let herself be bundled off back to the White
Tower.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can turn back from this without incurring
<em>toh</em>, Elayne.&rdquo; Aviendha, scowling, still wore her Aiel
garments, with her single silver necklace and heavy ivory bracelet.
Her stocky bay was a hand shorter than Fireheart or Birgitte&rsquo;s
lean gray, Arrow, and much gentler to handle, though she rode more
easily than once she had. Dark-stockinged legs bared above the knee
by straddling a saddle, she actually looked warm, except for the
shawl wrapped around her head. Unlike Birgitte, she had not ceased
her attempts to dissuade Elayne. &ldquo;Surprise is all very well, but
they will respect you more if they must meet you halfway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can hardly abandon Merilille,&rdquo; Elayne said more
patiently than she felt. Perhaps she was not weary any longer, but
neither did she feel particularly fresh, not at all ready to put up
with badgering. But she did not want to snap at Aviendha. &ldquo;She
might feel something of a fool, standing there with a letter
announcing that I&rsquo;m coming and I don&rsquo;t come. Worse, I
would feel a fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better to feel a fool than be one,&rdquo; Birgitte
muttered, half under her breath. Her dark cloak spread behind her
saddle, and her intricate braid hung from the opening of her hood
almost to her waist. Pulling that hood up just enough to frame her
face was the one concession she had made to the cold and the
gusting wind that sometimes lifted fresh-fallen snow like feathers.
She did not want her vision obscured. The cover on her bow&rsquo;s
saddle-case, meant to keep the bowstring dry, hung down so she
could reach the bow quickly. The suggestion that she wear a sword
had been quashed with as much indignation as if Elayne had asked
Aviendha to wear one. Birgitte knew the bow, but she claimed she
might stab herself trying to draw a sword. Still, her short green
coat would have blended into woodlands at another time of the year,
and for a wonder, her wide-legged trousers were the same color. She
was a Warder now, not the Captain-General of the Queen&rsquo;s
Guard, yet she was not so pleased by the title as might have been
expected. The bond carried as much frustration as alertness.</p>

<p>Elayne sighed, her breath misting. &ldquo;You two know what
I hope to achieve here. You&rsquo;ve known since I decided. Why are
you suddenly treating me as if I&rsquo;m made of blown glass?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pair exchanged looks past her, each waiting for
the other to speak first, then silently turned to stare straight
ahead, and suddenly she knew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When my child is born,&rdquo; she said dryly, &ldquo;you can
both apply to be her wet nurse.&rdquo; If her child was &ldquo;her.&rdquo; If Min had
said, it was lost in Aviendha and Birgitte&rsquo;s wine-hazed
memories of that night. It might be better to have a son first, so
he could begin his training before his sister came. Yet a daughter
secured the succession, while a lone son would be pushed aside, and
as much as she wanted more than one, nothing said she would have
another child. The Light send her more of Rand&rsquo;s children, but
she had to be practical. &ldquo;I myself do not need a wet nurse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha&rsquo;s sun-darkened cheeks turned darker
with embarrassment. Birgitte&rsquo;s expression did not change, yet
the same emotion oozed along the Warder bond.</p>

<p>They rode slowly, following Merilille&rsquo;s tracks
for close on two hours, and Elayne was thinking that the nearest
camp must be very close when Birgitte suddenly pointed ahead and
said, &ldquo;Shienarans,&rdquo; then eased her bow in its case. Alertness
swallowed frustration and everything else in the bond. Aviendha
touched the hilt of her belt knife as if making sure it was
there.</p>

<p>Waiting beneath the trees, off to one side from
Merilille&rsquo;s traces, men and horses alike were so still that
Elayne almost took them for natural outcrops of some sort until she
made out the strange swooping crests on their helmets. Their mounts
were not armored, as Shienaran heavies&rsquo; animals often were,
but the men themselves wore plate-and-mail, with long-hilted swords
on their backs, and swords and maces hung at their belts and from
their saddles. Their dark eyes never blinked. One of the horses
swished its tail, and the movement seemed startling.</p>

<p>A sharp-faced man with a harsh voice spoke as Elayne
and the other two women drew rein in front of him. The crest atop
his helmet looked like narrow wings. &ldquo;King Easar sends his
assurance of your safety, Elayne Sedai, and I add my own. I am
Kayen Yokata, Lord of Fal Eisen, and may Peace abandon me and the
Blight consume my soul if harm befalls you or anyone with you in
our camp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was not so comforting as Elayne might have
wished. All these guarantees of her safety only made clear that
there had been some question of it, and might still be. &ldquo;Does an
Aes Sedai need assurances from Shienarans?&rdquo; she said. She started
to run through a novice exercise for calmness, and realized she did
not need it. Very strange. &ldquo;You may lead, Lord Kayen.&rdquo; He merely
nodded and turned his horse.</p>

<p>Some of the Shienarans glanced at Aviendha without
expression, recognizing an Aiel, but for the most part they simply
fell in behind. Only the hooves crunching the harder snow beneath
the fresh fall broke the silence of their short ride. She had been
right. The Shienaran camp was very close. She began to see
sentries, mounted and armored, just minutes later, and soon after
that they rode into the Shienaran camp.</p>

<p>Sprawled among the trees, the encampment seemed
larger than she had imagined. Whether she looked left, right or
ahead, tents and cookfires, lines of tethered horses and rows of
wagons stretched out of her sight. As she and her escort passed,
soldiers looked up in curiosity, hard-faced men with their heads
shaved except for a tuft on top that was sometimes long enough to
reach the shoulders. Few wore any part of their armor, but armor
and weapons always lay close to hand. The smell was not so bad as
Merilille had described, though she could make out the faint odor
of latrines and horse dung beneath the aroma of whatever was
boiling in all these cookpots. No one appeared hungry, though many
were lean. Not the leanness of starvation, though, just that of men
who had never carried much fat on them. She did notice that there
were no spits over any fire she could see. Meat would be harder to
come by than grain, though grain itself was in short enough supply
this late in winter. Barley soup did not strengthen a man the way
meat did. They needed to move soon; nowhere could support four
armies this size for long. She just had to make sure they moved in
the right direction.</p>

<p>Not everyone she saw was a soldier with a shaven
head, of course, though the men among them looked almost as hard.
There were fletchers making arrows, wheelwrights working on wagons,
farriers shoeing horses, laundresses stirring boiling kettles,
women working with needles who might have been seamstresses or
wives. Great numbers of people always followed an army, sometimes
as many as the soldiers themselves. She did not see anyone who
could have been Aes Sedai, though; sisters were unlikely to push up
their sleeves and work wooden paddles in the laundry kettles, or
don patched woolens and sit darning breeches. Why did they want to
remain hidden? She resisted the desire to embrace the Source, to
draw <em>saidar</em> through the turtle <em>angreal</em> pinned to
her breast. One battle at a time, and first she must fight for
Andor.</p>

<p>Before a much larger tent than any of the others she
could see, pale canvas with a single long peak, Kayen dismounted
and handed her down. He hesitated over whether to do the same for
Birgitte and Aviendha, but Birgitte solved his dilemma by stepping
down smoothly and handing her reins to a waiting soldier, Aviendha
by half-falling out of the saddle. She had improved her riding, but
mounting and dismounting still gave her difficulty. Glaring around
her to see whether anyone was laughing, she smoothed down her bulky
skirts, then unwrapped the shawl from around her head and settled
it on her shoulders. Birgitte watched her horse being taken away as
though she wished she had taken her bow and quiver from the saddle.
Kayen pulled open one of the entry flaps and bowed.</p>

<p>Drawing a last deep calming breath, Elayne led the
other two women in. She could not allow them to see her as a
supplicant. She was not here to beg, or to defend.
<em>Sometimes</em>, Gareth Bryne had told her when she was a child,
<em>you find yourself outnumbered, with no path to slip away.
Always do what your enemy least expects, Elayne. In that case, you
must attack</em>. From the start, she must attack.</p>

<p>Inside, Merilille glided to her across the layered
carpets laid down for a floor. The diminutive Gray&rsquo;s smile was
not precisely relieved, but clearly she was glad to see Elayne.
Aside from her, there were only five others present, two women and
three men, and one of the latter was a servant, an old cavalryman
by his bowed legs and scarred face, who came to take cloaks and
gloves&mdash;and blink at Aviendha&mdash;before retreating to a
plain wooden table that held a silver tray with a tall-necked
pitcher and an array of cups. The other four ruled the nations of
the Borderlands. A scattering of backless camp chairs and four
large braziers holding glowing coals completed the tent&rsquo;s
furnishings. This was not the sort of reception the Daughter-Heir
of Andor might have expected, with courtiers and many servants, and
idle conversation to be made before serious discussions could
begin, and men and women at those rulers&rsquo; shoulders to advise
them. What she found was what she had hoped for.</p>

<p>Healing had rid Merilille&rsquo;s eyes of their dark
circles before she left the Palace, and she made Elayne&rsquo;s
introduction with simple dignity. &ldquo;This is Elayne Trakand, of the
Green Ajah, as I told you.&rdquo; That, and nothing more. Elayne knew
enough from Vandene to pick out one from another of the four rulers
who faced her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I give you welcome, Elayne Sedai,&rdquo; Easar of Shienar
said. &ldquo;Peace and the Light favor you.&rdquo; He was a short man, no
taller than herself, slim in a bronze-colored coat, his face
unwrinkled despite a long white topknot that hung over the side of
his head. Looking at his sad eyes, she reminded herself that he was
accounted a wise ruler and a skilled diplomat as well as a fine
soldier. In appearance, he was none of those things. &ldquo;May I offer
you wine? The spices are not fresh, but they have gained extra
sharpness with age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When Merilille told us you would come all the way
from Caemlyn today, I confess I would have doubted her, were she
not Aes Sedai.&rdquo; Ethenielle of Kandor, perhaps half a hand taller
than Merilille, was plump, her black hair lightly dusted with gray,
but there was nothing motherly about her despite her smile. Regal
dignity clothed her as much as did her fine blue wool. Her eyes
were blue, too, clear and level.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are pleased that you did come,&rdquo; Paitar of Arafel
said in a surprisingly deep, rich voice that made Elayne feel
warmed, somehow. &ldquo;We have much to discuss with you.&rdquo; Vandene had
said he was the most beautiful man in the Borderlands, and perhaps
he had been long ago, but age had laid deep lines in his face, and
only a fringe of short gray hair remained on his head. He was tall
and broad-shouldered, though, in plain green, and he did look
strong. And not a fool.</p>

<p>Where the others carried their years with grace,
Tenobia of Saldaea flaunted youth if not beauty, with her
eagle&rsquo;s beak of a nose and wide mouth. Her tilted, almost
purple eyes, level with Elayne&rsquo;s, were her best feature.
Perhaps her only one. Where the others dressed simply, even if they
did rule nations, her pale blue dress was worked with pearls and
sapphires and she wore more sapphires in her hair. Suitable for the
court, but hardly for a camp. And where they were courteous&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;Under the Light, Merilille Sedai,&rdquo; Tenobia said in a high voice,
frowning, &ldquo;I know you speak truth, but she looks more a child than
an Aes Sedai. You did not mention she would be bringing a
black-eyed Aiel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Easar&rsquo;s face never changed, but Paitar&rsquo;s
mouth tightened, and Ethenielle went so far as to cut her eyes
briefly toward Tenobia in a glance that would have suited a mother.
A very irritated and displeased mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Black?&rdquo; Aviendha muttered in confusion. &ldquo;My eyes are
not black. I never saw black eyes except on a peddler until I
crossed the Dragonwall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know I can speak only the truth, Tenobia, and I
assure you,&rdquo; Merilille began.</p>

<p>Elayne silenced her with a touch on the arm. &ldquo;It is
enough that you know I am Aes Sedai, Tenobia. This is my sister,
Aviendha, of the Nine Valleys Sept of the Taardad Aiel.&rdquo; Aviendha
smiled at them, or at least bared her teeth. &ldquo;This is my Warder,
Lady Birgitte Trahelion.&rdquo; Birgitte made a short bow, her golden
braid swaying.</p>

<p>One announcement caused as many startled looks as the
other&mdash;an Aiel woman was her <em>sister</em>? her Warder was
a <em>woman</em>?&mdash;but Tenobia and the others ruled lands on
the edge of the Blight, where nightmares truly might walk abroad in
daylight and anyone who let themselves be startled too greatly was
as good as dead. Elayne gave them no chance to recover fully,
though. <em>Attack before they know what you are doing</em>, Gareth
Bryne had said, <em>and keep attacking until you rout them or break
through</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we consider the niceties completed?&rdquo; she said,
taking a cup that gave off the aroma of spiced wine from the tray
proffered by the old soldier. A surge of caution flowed along the
Warder bond, and she saw Aviendha glance sideways at the cup, but
she did not mean to drink. She was just glad neither actually
spoke. &ldquo;Only a fool would think you have come all this way to
invade Andor,&rdquo; she said, walking to the chairs and sitting. Rulers
or not, they had no choice but to follow or stare at her back. At
Birgitte&rsquo;s back, since she stood behind her. As usual,
Aviendha folded herself to the floor and arranged her skirts in a
neat fan. They followed. &ldquo;The Dragon Reborn brings you,&rdquo; Elayne
went on. &ldquo;You requested this audience with me because I was at
Falme. The question is, why is that important to you? Do you think
I can tell you more of what happened there than you already know?
The Horn of Valere was sounded, dead heroes out of legend rode
against Seanchan invaders, and the Dragon Reborn fought the Shadow
in the sky for all to see. If you know that much, you know as much
as I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Audience?&rdquo; Tenobia said incredulously, pausing
half-seated. The camp chair creaked as she let herself drop the
rest of the way. &ldquo;No one <em>requested</em> an <em>audience</em>!
Even if you already held the throne of Andor&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us stay to the point, Tenobia,&rdquo; Paitar broke in
mildly. Rather than sitting, he stood, occasionally sipping at his
wine. Elayne was glad she could see the wrinkles on his face. That
voice could confuse a woman&rsquo;s thoughts, otherwise.</p>

<p>Ethenielle spared Tenobia another quick glance while
seating herself, and murmured something under her breath. Elayne
thought she heard the word &ldquo;marriage,&rdquo; with a rueful sound, but
that made no sense. In any case, she turned her attention to Elayne
as soon as she was settled in her chair. &ldquo;I might like your
ferocity another time, Elayne Sedai, but there&rsquo;s little to
enjoy falling into an ambush that one of your own allies has helped
lay.&rdquo; Tenobia scowled, though Ethenielle did not even dart those
sharp eyes in her direction. &ldquo;What happened at Falme,&rdquo; the Queen of
Kandor told Elayne, &ldquo;is not so important as what came of it. No,
Paitar; we must tell her what we must tell her. She already knows
too much for anything else. We know that you were a companion to
the Dragon Reborn at Falme, Elayne. A friend, perhaps. You are
right; we have not come to invade. We have come to find the Dragon
Reborn. And we have marched all this way only to find that no one
knows where he is to be found. Do you know where he is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne hid her relief at the blunt question. It would
never have been asked if they thought she was more than a companion
or friend. She could be just as blunt. Attack and keep attacking.
&ldquo;Why do you want to find him? Emissaries or messengers could take
any word you wanted to send him.&rdquo; Which was as good as asking why
they brought vast armies.</p>

<p>Easar had taken no wine, and he stood with his fists
on his hips. &ldquo;The war against the Shadow is fought along the
Blight,&rdquo; he said grimly. &ldquo;The Last Battle will be fought in the
Blight, if not at Shayol Ghul itself. And he ignores the
Borderlands and concerns himself with lands that have not seen a
Myrddraal since the Trolloc Wars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> decides where to
dance the spears, wetlander,&rdquo; Aviendha sneered. &ldquo;If you follow him,
then you fight where he says.&rdquo; No one looked at her. They were all
looking at Elayne. No one took the opening Aviendha had
offered.</p>

<p>Elayne made herself breathe evenly and meet their
gazes without blinking. A Borderland army was too great a trap for
Elaida to lay in order to catch Elayne Trakand, but Rand
al&rsquo;Thor, the Dragon Reborn, might be another matter. Merilille
shifted on her chair, but she had her instructions. No matter how
many treaties the Gray sister had negotiated, once Elayne began,
she was to keep silent. Confidence flowed along the bond with
Birgitte. Rand was a stone, unreadable, and distant. &ldquo;You know of
the White Tower&rsquo;s proclamation regarding him?&rdquo; she asked
quietly. They must, by now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Tower calls anathema on anyone who approaches
the Dragon Reborn save through the offices of the Tower,&rdquo; Paitar
said just as quietly. Taking a seat at last, he regarded her with
serious eyes. &ldquo;You are Aes Sedai. Surely that counts as the same
thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Tower meddles everywhere,&rdquo; Tenobia muttered.
&ldquo;No, Ethenielle; I will say this! The whole world knows the Tower
is divided. Do you follow Elaida or the rebels, Elayne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The world seldom knows what it thinks it knows,&rdquo;
Merilille said in a voice that seemed to lower the temperature in
the tent. The tiny woman who ran when Elayne ordered her and
squeaked when Windfinders looked at her sat up straight and faced
Tenobia as an Aes Sedai, her smooth face as frosty as her tone.
&ldquo;The affairs of the Tower are for initiates to know, Tenobia. If
you want to learn, ask to have your name written in the novice
book, and in twenty years you might learn a little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her Illumined Majesty, Tenobia si Bashere Kazadi,
Shield of the North and Sword of the Blightborder, High Seat of
House Kazadi, Lady of Shahayni, Asnelle, Kunwar and Ganai, glared
at Merilille with all the fury of a blizzard. And said nothing.
Elayne&rsquo;s respect for her increased slightly.</p>

<p>Merilille&rsquo;s disobedience did not displease her.
It saved her from trying to prevaricate while seeming to speak only
the truth. Egwene said they must try to live as if they had already
sworn the Three Oaths, and here and now, Elayne felt the weight of
it. Here, she was not the Daughter-Heir of Andor struggling to
claim her mother&rsquo;s throne, or not only that. She was an Aes
Sedai of the Green Ajah, with more reason for taking care with her
words than simply hiding what she wanted to remain hidden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell you exactly where he is.&rdquo; Truth,
because she could only have given them a vague direction, roughly
toward Tear, and no telling how far; truth, because she did not
trust them sufficiently for even that. She just had to be careful
what she said, and how. &ldquo;I do know that apparently he intends to
remain where he is awhile.&rdquo; He had not moved for days, the first
time since leaving her that he had remained in any one place longer
than half a day. &ldquo;I will tell you what I can, but only if you agree
that you will march south within the week. You will run out of
barley as well as meat if you remain here much longer, anyway. I
promise, you will be marching toward the Dragon Reborn.&rdquo; To begin
with they would be, at any rate.</p>

<p>Paitar shook his bald head. &ldquo;You want us to enter
Andor? Elayne Sedai&mdash;or should I call you Lady Elayne, now?&mdash;I wish you the Light&rsquo;s blessing in your quest for
Andor&rsquo;s crown, but not enough to offer my men to fight for
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elayne Sedai and Lady Elayne are one and the same,&rdquo;
she told them. &ldquo;I do not ask you to fight for me. In truth, I hope
with all my heart that you cross Andor without so much as a
skirmish.&rdquo; Raising her silver winecup, she wet her lips without
drinking. A flash of caution surged through the Warder bond, and in
spite of herself, Elayne laughed. Aviendha was watching her from
the corner of her eye and frowning. Even now, they were going to
look after the mother to be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad someone finds this amusing,&rdquo; Ethenielle
said wryly. &ldquo;Try to think like a Southlander, Paitar. They play the
Game of Houses here, and I think she is being very clever at it.
She should be, I suppose; I&rsquo;ve always heard that Aes Sedai
created <em>Daes Dae&rsquo;mar</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think tactics, Paitar.&rdquo; Easar was studying Elayne,
wearing a small smile. &ldquo;We move toward Caemlyn as invaders, so any
Andoran will see it. Winter may be mild here, but we&rsquo;ll still
need weeks to ride that far. By the time we do, she will have
rallied enough of the Andoran Houses against us, and to her, that
she will have the Lion Throne, or near enough. At the least, enough
strength will have been pledged to her that no one else will be
able to stand long against her.&rdquo; Tenobia shifted on her chair,
frowning and adjusting her skirts, but there was a respect in her
eyes when she looked at Elayne that had not been there before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when we reach Caemlyn, Elayne Sedai,&rdquo; Ethenielle
said, &ldquo;you will&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;negotiate&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;us into leaving Andor without
a battle being fought.&rdquo; That came out as not quite a question, but
almost. &ldquo;Very clever indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If all works as she plans,&rdquo; Easar said, his smile
fading. He put out a hand without looking, and the old soldier
placed a winecup in it. &ldquo;Battles seldom do; even this bloodless
sort, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I very much want it all to be bloodless,&rdquo; Elayne
said. Light, it had to be, or instead of saving her country from
civil war, she had plunged it into worse. &ldquo;I will work hard to see
that it is. I expect you to do the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you also happen to know where my Uncle Davram is,
Elayne Sedai?&rdquo; Tenobia said suddenly. &ldquo;Davram Bashere? I would like
to speak with him as much as with the Dragon Reborn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord Davram is not far from Caemlyn, Tenobia. I
cannot promise he will still be there when you arrive, though. That
is, if you agree?&rdquo; Elayne made herself breathe, to hide her
anxiety. She was beyond where she could turn back, now. They would
move south now, she was certain, but without their agreement, there
would be bloodshed.</p>

<p>For a long moment there was silence in the tent
except for a coal cracking in one of the braziers. Ethenielle
exchanged glances with the two men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So long as I get to see my uncle,&rdquo; Tenobia said
heatedly, &ldquo;I am agreed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On my honor, I am agreed,&rdquo; Easar said decisively,
and almost atop him, if in a milder tone, Paitar said, &ldquo;Under the
Light, I am agreed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then so are we all,&rdquo; Ethenielle breathed. &ldquo;And now
your part, Elayne Sedai. Where do we find the Dragon Reborn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A thrill shot through Elayne, and she could not say
whether it was exhilaration, or fear. She had done what she had
come for, risked the dangers for herself and for Andor, and only
time would tell whether she had made the right decision. She
answered without hesitation. &ldquo;As I told you, I cannot say exactly
where. A search in Murandy will be profitable, though.&rdquo; Truth,
though the profit would be hers, not theirs, if any came. Egwene
had moved from Murandy today, taking away the army that had held
Arathelle Renshar and the other nobles in the south. Perhaps the
Borderlanders moving south would force Arathelle and Luan and
Pelivar to decide as Dyelin believed they would, to support her.
The Light send it so.</p>

<p>Except for Tenobia, the Borderlanders did not seem at
all exultant over learning where to find Rand. Ethenielle let out a
long breath, almost a sigh, and Easar simply nodded and pursed his
lips in thought. Paitar drank down half his wine, the first real
drink he had taken. It very much seemed that however much they
wanted to find the Dragon Reborn, they were not looking forward to
meeting him. Tenobia, on the other hand, called for the old soldier
to bring her wine and went on about how much she wanted to see her
uncle. Elayne would not have thought the woman had so much family
feeling.</p>

<p>Night came early that time of year, and only a few
hours of daylight remained, as Easar pointed out, offering beds for
the night. Ethenielle suggested that her own tent would be more
comfortable, yet they gave no sign of disappointment when Elayne
said she must leave immediately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remarkable that you can cover such distance so
quickly,&rdquo; Ethenielle murmured. &ldquo;I have heard Aes Sedai speak of a
thing called Traveling. A lost Talent?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you encountered many sisters on your journey?&rdquo;
Elayne asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some,&rdquo; Ethenielle replied. &ldquo;There are Aes Sedai
everywhere, it seems.&rdquo; Even Tenobia was suddenly
expressionless.</p>

<p>Allowing Birgitte to lay the marten-lined cloak on
her shoulders, Elayne nodded. &ldquo;So there are. Would you have our
horses brought?&rdquo;</p>

<p>None of them spoke again until they were out of the
camp, riding through the trees. The horse-smell and latrine-stink
had seemed mild in the camp, but their absence here made the air
seem very fresh, and the snow whiter, somehow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were very quiet, Birgitte Trahelion,&rdquo; Aviendha
said, thumping her bay&rsquo;s ribs with her heels. She always
believed the animal would stop without reminders to keep going.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Warder doesn&rsquo;t speak for her Aes Sedai; she
bloody listens and watches her back,&rdquo; Birgitte replied dryly. It
was unlikely the forest contained anyone who might threaten them,
this near the Shienaran camp, but her bow remained uncovered, and
her eyes scanned the trees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A much hastier form of negotiation than I am used
to, Elayne,&rdquo; Merilille said. &ldquo;Normally, these matters require days
or weeks of talking, if not months, before anything is agreed. You
were lucky they are not Domani. Or Cairhienin,&rdquo; she admitted
judiciously. &ldquo;Borderlanders are refreshingly open and
straightforward. Easy to deal with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Open and straightforward? Elayne shook her head
slightly. They wanted to find Rand, but concealed why. They
concealed the presence of sisters, too. At least they would be
moving away from him, once she had them on their way to Murandy.
That would have to do, for now, but she had to warn him, once she
could figure out how to do so without endangering him. <em>Take
care of him, Min</em>, she thought. <em>Take care of him for
us</em>.</p>

<p>A few miles from the camp, she reined in to study the
forest as assiduously as Birgitte. Especially behind them. The sun
sat low on the treetops. A trotting white fox appeared for an
instant and was gone. Something flickered on a bare gray branch, a
bird perhaps, or a squirrel. A dark hawk suddenly plummeted out of
the sky, and a thin squeal broke the air and ended suddenly. They
were not being followed. It was not the Shienarans she worried
about, but those hidden sisters. The weariness that had vanished
earlier, with Merilille&rsquo;s news, had returned with interest now
that her meeting with the Borderlanders was done. She wanted
nothing so much as to climb into her bed as soon as possible, but
she did not want it enough to give the weave for Traveling to
sisters she did not know.</p>

<p>She could have woven a gateway to the Palace
stableyard, but only at the risk of killing someone who happened to
be crossing where it opened, so instead she wove one for another
place she knew just as well. She was so tired that it required
effort to weave, so tired that she did not think of the
<em>angreal</em> pinned to her dress until the silvery slash had
appeared in the air and opened onto a field covered with brown
grass beaten flat by earlier snowfalls, a field just south of
Caemlyn where Gareth Bryne had often taken her to watch the
Queen&rsquo;s Guards ride to command, breaking from columns to form
a line four abreast at a shouted order.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you just going to look at it?&rdquo; Birgitte
demanded.</p>

<p>Elayne blinked. Aviendha and Merilille were studying
her with concern.</p>

<p>Birgitte&rsquo;s face gave nothing away, but the bond
carried worry, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just thinking,&rdquo; Elayne said, and heeled
Fireheart through the gateway. Bed would be wonderful.</p>

<p>From the old practice field to the tall arched gates
set in the pale, fifty-foot-high city walls was a short ride. The
long market buildings lining the approach to the gates were empty
at this hour, but sharp-eyed Guardsmen still kept a watch. They
watched her and the others ride in apparently without recognizing
her. Mercenaries, very likely. They would not know her unless they
saw her on the Lion Throne. With the help of the Light, and luck,
they would see her there.</p>

<p>Twilight was fast approaching, the sky turning a deep
gray and the shadows slanting long across the streets. Very few
people were still out and about, a scattering of folk hurrying to
finish their day&rsquo;s work before going home to dinner and a warm
fire. A pair of bearers carrying a merchant&rsquo;s dark lacquered
sedan-chair went trotting past along a street ahead, and a few
moments later one of the big pump-wagons rumbled in the other
direction behind eight running horses, its iron-shod wheels loud on
the paving stones. Another fire, somewhere. They happened most
often at night. A patrol of four Guardsman walked their horses
toward her and on, without looking at her twice. They did not
recognize her anymore than the men at the gates.</p>

<p>Swaying in her saddle, she rode wishing for her
bed.</p>

<p>It was a shock to realize that she was being lifted
down from her saddle. She opened eyes she did not remember closing
and found herself being carried into the Palace in Birgitte&rsquo;s
arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put me down,&rdquo; she said tiredly. &ldquo;I can still
walk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can hardly stand up,&rdquo; Birgitte growled. &ldquo;Be
still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot talk with her!&rdquo; Aviendha said loudly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She really does need sleep, Master Norry,&rdquo; Merilille
said in firm tones. &ldquo;Tomorrow will have to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, but tomorrow will <em>not</em> do,&rdquo;
Norry replied, for a wonder sounding very firm himself. &ldquo;It is
<em>urgent</em> I speak with her now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s head wanted to wobble as she lifted it.
Halwin Norry was clutching that leather folder to his skinny chest,
as always, but the dry man who talked of crowned heads with the
same dusty tone he used for speaking of the roof repairs was almost
dancing on his toes in an effort to get by Aviendha and Merilille,
who each had him by an arm, holding him back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put me down, Birgitte,&rdquo; she said again, and for the
second wonder in as many moments, Birgitte obeyed. She kept a
supporting arm around Elayne, though, for which Elayne was
grateful. She was not sure her legs would have supported her for
very long. &ldquo;What is it, Master Norry? Let the man go, Aviendha.
Merilille?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The First Clerk darted forward as soon they let go of
him. &ldquo;Word began arriving soon after you left, my Lady,&rdquo; he said,
not sounding dusty at all. Worry pinched his brows. &ldquo;There are four
armies&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Small, I should say now, I suppose. Light, I recall
when five thousand men <em>was</em> an army.&rdquo; He rubbed a hand over
his bald head, leaving the white tufts rising behind his ears in
ruffled disarray. &ldquo;There are four small armies approaching Caemlyn,
from the east,&rdquo; he went on in a more usual tone for him. Almost.
&ldquo;They will be here inside the week, I fear. Twenty thousand men.
Perhaps thirty. I cannot be sure.&rdquo; He half extended the folder to
her as if offering to show her the papers inside. He <em>was</em>
agitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; she said. Elenia had estates, and forces, in
the east, but so did Naean. But neither could raise twenty thousand
men. And the snow and mud should have held them until spring.
<em>&ldquo;Should&rdquo; and &ldquo;would&rdquo; build no bridges</em>, she seemed to hear
Lini&rsquo;s thin voice say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know, my Lady,&rdquo; Norry replied, &ldquo;not
yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It did not matter, Elayne supposed. Whoever it was,
they were coming, and now. &ldquo;At first light, Master Norry, I want
you to begin buying all the foodstuffs you can find outside the
walls and get it brought in. Birgitte, have the bannerman
announcing the signing bounty add that mercenaries have four days
to sign with the Guards or they must leave the city. And have
announcements made to the people, too, Master Norry. Whoever wants
to leave before the siege begins should go now. It will cut down
the number of mouths we have to feed, and it might lead a few more
men to enlist in the Guards.&rdquo; Pushing away from Birgitte&rsquo;s
support, she strode along the hallway, heading for her apartments.
The others were forced to follow. &ldquo;Merilille, let the Kinswomen
know, and the Atha&rsquo;an Miere. They may want to leave before it
begins, too, Maps, Birgitte. Have the good maps brought to my
apartments. And another thing, Master Norry&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no time for sleep, no time for weariness.
She had a city to defend.</p>
