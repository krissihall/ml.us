<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hat
have we here?&rdquo; a woman&rsquo;s hard voice said.
Faile looked up, and stared, hot tea gone from her thoughts for the
moment.</p>

<p>Two Aiel women with a much shorter <em>
gai&rsquo;shain</em> woman between them came out of the swirling
snow, sinking halfway up their calves in the white carpet that
covered the ground but still managing powerful strides. The taller
women did, anyway; the <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> stumbled and
floundered trying to keep up, and one of the others had a hand on
her shoulder to make sure she did. All three were worth a stare.
The woman in white kept her head meekly down as much as she could
and her hands folded in her wide sleeves as a <em>
gai&rsquo;shain</em> was supposed to, but her robes had the sheen of
heavy silk, of all things. <em>Gai&rsquo;shain</em> were forbidden
jewelry, yet a wide, elaborate belt of gold and firedrops cinched
her waist and a matching collar was just visible inside her cowl,
nearly covering her neck. Very few besides royalty could afford the
like. Strange as the <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> was, however, it was
the others Faile studied. Something told her they were Wise Ones.
There was too much authority about them for anything else; these
were women used to giving orders and being obeyed. Beyond that,
though, their simple presence caught the eye. The woman pushing the
<em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> along, a stern blue-eyed eagle with a dark
gray shawl wrapped around her head, stood a good span in height, as
much as most Aielmen, while the other was at least half a hand
taller than Perrin! She was not bulky, though, except in one
particular. Sandy yellow hair flowed to her waist, held back from
her face by a wide dark kerchief, and her brown shawl lay across
her shoulders, open enough to show an incredible amount of bosom
thrusting half out of her pale blouse. How did she avoid freezing,
exposing so much skin in this weather? All those heavy necklaces of
ivory and gold must feel like bands of ice!</p>

<p>As they stopped in front of the kneeling prisoners,
the eagle-faced woman frowned disapprovingly at the Shaido who had
captured them, and made a curt gesture of dismissal with her free
hand. For some reason, she continued to hold on to the <em>
gai&rsquo;shain</em>&rsquo;s shoulder tightly. The three Maidens
turned immediately, hurrying toward the passing throng of Shaido.
One of the men did, as well, but Rolan and the rest exchanged
flat-eyed looks before they followed. Perhaps it meant something,
perhaps nothing. Faile suddenly knew how someone in a whirlpool
felt, grabbing desperately at straws.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What we have is more <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> for
Sevanna,&rdquo; the incredibly tall woman said in amused tones. She had a
strong face that some might call pretty, but alongside the other
Wise One, she seemed soft. &ldquo;Sevanna will not be satisfied until the
entire world is <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>, Therava. Not that I would
object to that myself,&rdquo; she finished with a laugh.</p>

<p>The eagle-eyed Wise One did not laugh. Her face was
stone. Her voice was stone. &ldquo;Sevanna has too many <em>
gai&rsquo;shain</em> already, Someryn. We have too many <em>
gai&rsquo;shain</em>. They slow us to a crawl when we should race.&rdquo;
Her iron stare ran along the kneeling line.</p>

<p>Faile flinched when that gaze touched her, and
hurriedly buried her face in the mug. She had never seen Therava
before, but in that glance she knew the woman&rsquo;s sort, eager to
crush any challenge utterly and capable of seeing challenge in a
casual glance. Bad enough when it was only a fool noble at court,
or someone encountered on the road, but escape could become
more than difficult if this eagle took a personal interest. Just
the same, she watched the woman from the corner of her eye. It felt
like watching a banded adder, scales glittering in the sun, coiled
a foot from her face.</p>

<p><em>Meek</em>, she thought. <em>I am kneeling here
meekly, with no thought in my head but drinking my tea. No need to
look at me twice, you cold-eyed witch</em>. She hoped the others
saw what she did.</p>

<p>Alliandre did not. She tried to rise to her swollen
feet, tottered, then sank back to her knees with a wince. Even so,
she knelt upright in the falling snow, head high, a red-striped
blanket held around her as if it were a fine silk shawl over a
splendid gown. Bared legs and windblown hair spoiled the effect
somewhat, yet she was still arrogance on a pedestal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Alliandre Maritha Kigarin, Queen of Ghealdan,&rdquo;
she announced loudly, very much queen addressing ruffian vagabonds.
&ldquo;You would be wise to treat me and my companions well, and punish
those who have handled us so crudely. You can gain a large ransom
for us, larger than you can imagine, and pardon for your crimes. My
liege lady and I will require suitable accommodation for ourselves
until arrangements can be made, and for her maid. Lesser will do
for the others, so long as they are not harmed. I will pay no
ransom if you ill-treat the least of my liege lady&rsquo;s
servants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faile could have groaned&mdash;did the idiot woman
think these people were simple bandits?&mdash;only she had no time
to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that true, Galina? Is she a wetlander queen?&rdquo;
Another woman rode out from behind the prisoners, her tall black
gelding walking softly in the snow. Faile thought she must be Aiel,
but she was unsure. It was difficult to say for certain with the
other woman on horseback, but she seemed at least as tall as Faile
herself, and few women were except among the Aiel, certainly not
with those green eyes in a sun-dark face. And yet&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;That wide,
dark skirt looked like the Aiel women&rsquo;s at a glance, but it
was divided for riding and appeared to be silk, as was her creamy
blouse, and the hem revealed red boots in her stirrups. The wide
folded kerchief that held back her long golden hair was brocaded
red silk, and a thumb-thick circlet of gold and firedrops nestled
over it. In contrast to the Wise Ones&rsquo; worked gold and carved
ivory, her ropes of fat pearls and necklaces of emeralds and
sapphires and rubies half hid nearly as much bosom as Someryn had
on display. The bracelets climbing almost to her elbows differed
from those worn by the two Wise Ones in the same way, and Aiel did
not wear rings, but gems sparkled on every finger. Instead of a
dark shawl, a bright crimson cloak, bordered with golden embroidery
and lined with white fur, flared around her in the stiff breeze.
She did sit her saddle with the awkwardness of Aiel on horseback,
though. &ldquo;And a queen&rsquo;s,&rdquo; her tongue tripped unfamiliarly,
&ldquo;liege lady? That means the Queen swore oath to her? A truly
powerful woman, then. Answer me, Galina!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The silk-clad <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> hunched her
shoulders and favored the mounted woman with a groveling smile. &ldquo;A
truly powerful woman, to have a queen swear fealty, Sevanna,&rdquo; she
said eagerly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard of the like. Yet I think she
is who she claims. I saw Alliandre once, years ago, and the girl I
recall could well have grown into this woman. And she was crowned
Queen of Ghealdan. What she is doing in Amadicia, I don&rsquo;t
know. The Whitecloaks or Roedran either one would snap her up in
an instant if they&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough, Lina,&rdquo; Therava said firmly. The hand on
Galina&rsquo;s shoulder tightened visibly. &ldquo;You know I hate it when
you natter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> flinched as if struck,
and her mouth snapped shut. Practically writhing, she smiled up at
Therava, fawning even more wretchedly than she had for Sevanna.
Gold flashed on one of her fingers as she wrung her hands. Fear
flashed in her eyes, too. Dark eyes. Definitely not Aiel. Therava
seemed oblivious to the woman&rsquo;s truckling; a dog had been
called to heel and had obeyed. Her attention was all on Sevanna.
Someryn eyed the <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> sideways, her lips
twisting with contempt, but she folded her shawl across her bosom
and looked to Sevanna as well. Aiel did not give away much on their
faces, yet plainly she disliked Sevanna, and was wary of her at the
same time.</p>

<p>Faile&rsquo;s eyes followed the mounted woman, too,
over the edge of her mug. In a way, it was like seeing Logain, or
Mazrim Taim. Sevanna also had painted her name across the sky in
blood and fire. Cairhien would need years to recover from what she
had wrought there, and the ripples had spread to Andor and Tear and
beyond. Perrin laid the blame to a man called Couladin, but Faile
had heard enough of this woman to have a shrewd idea whose hand had
been behind it all. And no one disputed that the slaughter at
Dumai&rsquo;s Wells was Sevanna&rsquo;s fault. Perrin had almost died
there. She had a personal claim on Sevanna for that. She might be
willing to let Rolan keep his ears if she could settle that
claim.</p>

<p>The flamboyantly garbed woman walked her mount slowly
along the line of kneeling women, her steady green eyes almost as
cold as Therava&rsquo;s. The sound of snow crunching beneath the
black&rsquo;s hooves suddenly seemed loud. &ldquo;Which of you is the
maid?&rdquo; An odd question. Maighdin hesitated, tight-jawed, before
raising a hand from beneath her blanket. Sevanna nodded
thoughtfully. &ldquo;And the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;liege lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faile considered holding back, but one way or
another, Sevanna would learn what she wanted to know. Reluctantly,
she lifted her hand. And shivered from more than the cold. Therava
was watching with those cruel eyes, paying close attention. To
Sevanna, and to those she marked out.</p>

<p>How anyone could be unaware of that augering gaze,
Faile did not understand, yet Sevanna seemed so as she turned her
gelding down the back of the line. &ldquo;They cannot walk on those
feet,&rdquo; she said after a moment. &ldquo;I do not see why they should ride
with the children. Heal them, Galina.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faile gave a start and almost dropped the clay mug.
She pushed it toward the <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>, trying to make
out that that was what she had been doing all along. It was empty
anyway. The scarred fellow calmly began filling it up again from
his water bag of tea. Heal? Surely she could not mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Therava said, giving the <em>
gai&rsquo;shain</em> woman a shove that staggered her. &ldquo;Do it
quickly, little Lina. I know you do not want to disappoint me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Galina caught herself from falling, but only to
struggle on toward the prisoners. She sank above her knees in
places, her robes dragging in the snow, but she was intent on
reaching her goal. Wide-eyed fear and revulsion mingled on her
round face with&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;could it be, eagerness? All in all, it was a
sickening combination.</p>

<p>Sevanna completed her circuit, coming back to where
Faile could see her clearly, and reined in facing the Wise Ones.
The woman&rsquo;s full mouth was tight. The icy breeze rippled her
cloak, but she seemed unaware of it, or of the snow falling on her
head. &ldquo;I have just received word, Therava.&rdquo; Her voice was calm,
though lightning bolts should have been flashing from her eyes.
&ldquo;Tonight we camp with the Jonine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fifth sept,&rdquo; Therava replied flatly. For her,
also, wind and snow might as well not have existed. &ldquo;Five, while
seventy-eight remain scattered on the wind. Well that you remember
your pledge to reunite the Shaido, Sevanna. We will not wait
forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not lightning bolts, now. Sevanna&rsquo;s eyes were
green volcanoes erupting. &ldquo;I always do what I say, Therava. Well
that you remember that. And remember that you <em>advise</em> me.
<em>I</em> speak for the clan chief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wheeling her gelding, she drummed her heels on the
animal&rsquo;s ribs, trying to make him gallop back toward the river
of people and wagons, though no horse could do so in that depth of
snow. The black managed something faster than a walk, but not much.
Their faces expressionless as masks, Therava and Someryn watched
horse and rider fade into the falling white veil.</p>

<p>An important exchange, at least to Faile. She knew
tension tight as a harpstring when she saw it, and mutual hatred. A
weakness that might be exploited, if she could puzzle out how. And
it seemed the Shaido were not all here after all. Though more than
enough seemed to be, judging by the unending river of them passing
by. Galina reached her then, and anything else fled from her
mind.</p>

<p>Smoothing her face to a ragged semblance of
composure, Galina clutched Faile&rsquo;s head in both hands without
speaking a word. Faile might have gasped; she could not be sure.
The world seemed to fly by as she jerked halfway to her feet. Hours
streaked by, or heartbeats crawled. The white-clad woman stepped
back, and Faile collapsed on her face atop the brown blanket to lie
panting against the rough wool. Her feet no longer hurt, but
Healing always brought its own hunger, and she had eaten nothing
since yesterday&rsquo;s breakfast. She could have wolfed down <em>
plates</em> of anything that even looked like food. She no longer
felt tired, but her muscles were water instead of pudding. Pushing
herself up with arms that wanted to fold under her weight, she
unsteadily gathered the gray-striped blanket again. She felt
stunned as much by what she had seen on Galina&rsquo;s hand just
before Galina seized her as she did by the Healing. Gratefully she
let the scarred man hold the steaming mug to her mouth. She was not
sure her fingers could have held on to it.</p>

<p>Galina was wasting no time. A dazed Alliandre was
just attempting to rise from flat on her face, her striped covering
blanket sliding to the ground unnoticed. Her welts were gone, of
course. Maighdin still lay sprawled between her two blankets, loose
limbs poking out in every direction and twitching as she feebly
tried to collect herself. Chiad, with Galina&rsquo;s hands on her
head, lurched all the way to her feet, arms flung wide, breath
leaving her in a loud rush. The yellowed swelling on her face faded
away even as Faile watched. The Maiden dropped as if poleaxed when
Galina moved on to Bain, though she began stirring almost at
once.</p>

<p>Faile attended to her tea, and furious thought. The
gold on Galina&rsquo;s finger was a Great Serpent ring. She might
have thought it a strange present from whoever gave the woman her
other jewels if not for the Healing. Galina was Aes Sedai. She must
be. But what was an Aes Sedai doing here, in <em>
gai&rsquo;shain</em> robes? Not to mention apparently ready to
lick Sevanna&rsquo;s wrist and kiss Therava&rsquo;s feet! An Aes
Sedai!</p>

<p>Standing over a limp Arrela, the last in the line,
Galina panted slightly from the effort of Healing so many so
quickly, and gazed at Therava as though hopeful for a word of
praise. Without so much as a look at her, the two Wise Ones started
toward the river of Shaido, their heads together, talking. After a
moment, the Aes Sedai scowled and lifted her robes, hurrying after
them as quickly as she could. She glanced back more than once,
though. Faile had the feeling that she did so even after the
falling snow put a curtain between them.</p>

<p>More <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> came the other way, a
dozen men and women, and only one was Aiel, a lanky redhead with a
thin white scar from hairline to jaw. Faile recognized short,
pallid Cairhienin, and others she thought might be Amadician or
Altaran, taller and darker, and even a bronze-skinned Domani. The
Domani and one of the other women wore wide belts of shiny golden
chain tight around their waists, and collars of the flat links
around their necks. So did one of the men! In any case, jewelry on
<em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> seemed unimportant except as an oddity,
especially alongside the food and clothing they brought.</p>

<p>Some of the newcomers carried baskets with loaves of
bread and yellow cheese and dried beef, and the <em>
gai&rsquo;shain</em> already there with their water bags of tea
provided drink to wash it down. Faile was not alone in stuffing her
mouth with unseemly haste even while she dressed, clumsily and with
more mind to speed than modesty. The hooded white robe and two
thick under-robes seemed wondrously warm, just to keep the air off,
and so were heavy woolen stockings and soft Aiel boots that laced
to her knees&mdash;even the boots had been bleached
white!&mdash;but they did not fill up the hole in her middle.
The meat was tough as boot leather, the cheese nearly rock hard and
the bread not much softer, yet they tasted like a feast! Her mouth
watered for every bite.</p>

<p>Chewing a mouthful of cheese, she knotted the last
bootlace and stood, smoothing down her robes. As she reached for
some more bread, one of the women wearing gold, plump and plain and
weary-eyed, took another belt of golden chain out of a cloth sack
hanging from her shoulder. Hastily swallowing, Faile stepped back.
&ldquo;I would rather not have that, thank you.&rdquo; She had a sinking
feeling she had been wrong to dismiss the adornments as
unimportant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you want does not matter,&rdquo; the plump woman
replied tiredly. Her accent was Amadician, and cultured. &ldquo;You serve
the Lady Sevanna, now. You will wear what you are given and do as
you are told, or you will be punished until you see the error of
your ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few paces away, Maighdin was fending off the
Domani, resisting being fitted with a collar. Alliandre was backing
away from the man who wore golden chains, her hands raised and a
sickly expression on her face. He held out one of the belts toward
her. Thankfully, they were both looking to Faile, though. Perhaps
that switching in the forest had done some good.</p>

<p>Exhaling heavily, Faile nodded to them, then allowed
the plump <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> to fasten the wide belt around
her. With her example, the other two let their hands fall. It
seemed one blow too many for Alliandre, who stood staring at
nothing as she was belted and collared. Maighdin did her best to
glare a hole through the slim Domani. Faile tried smiling
encouragement, but smiling was difficult. To her, the collar&rsquo;s
catch snapping shut sounded like a prison door being locked. Belt
and collar could be removed as easily as they had been put on, but
<em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> serving &ldquo;the Lady Sevanna&rdquo; surely would be
watched very closely. Disaster was piling on disaster. Things had
to get better from here on. They had to.</p>

<p>Soon, Faile found herself tramping though the snow on
wobbly legs with a stumbling, dull-eyed Alliandre and a scowling
Maighdin, surrounded by <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> leading pack
animals, carrying large covered baskets on their backs, dragging
loaded barrows with the wheels lashed to wooden sleds. The carts
and wagons had sleds or broad runners, too, with the wheels tied on
top of the snow-shrouded cargo. Snow might be unfamiliar to the
Shaido, but they had learned something of traveling in it. Neither
Faile nor the other two bore any burdens, though the plump
Amadician woman made clear that they would be expected to carry or
haul tomorrow and from then on. However many Shaido were in the
column, it seemed a great city on the move, if not a nation.
Children up to twelve or thirteen rode on the carts and wagons, but
everyone else walked. All of the men wore the <em>
cadin&rsquo;sor</em>, but most women wore skirts and blouses and
shawls like the Wise Ones, and most of the men carried only a
single spear or no weapon at all and looked softer than the others.
Soft meaning that there were stones softer than granite.</p>

<p>By the time the Amadician left, without giving her
name or saying much more than obey or be punished, Faile realized
that she had lost sight of Bain and the rest somewhere in the
falling snow. No one tried to make her keep a particular place, so
she tramped wearily back and forth across the column, accompanied
by Alliandre and Maighdin. Keeping her hands folded together in her
sleeves made walking difficult, especially wading through snow, but
it did keep them warm. Warmer than the alternative, at least. The
wind made sure they kept their hoods well up. Despite the
identifying golden belts, neither <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> nor
Shaido looked at them twice. Despite crossing the column a dozen
times or more, however, the search proved fruitless. There were
people in white robes everywhere, more than without, and any of
those deep cowls could have hidden her other companions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will have to find them tonight,&rdquo; Maighdin said
finally. She actually managed to stalk through the deep snow, if in
an ungainly fashion. Her blue eyes were fierce inside the cavern of
her hood, and she gripped the broad golden chain around her neck
with one hand as if wanting to rip it off. &ldquo;As it is, we&rsquo;re
taking ten steps to one for everyone else. Twenty for one. It will
do us little good to arrive at tonight&rsquo;s camp too exhausted to
move.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On Faile&rsquo;s other side, Alliandre roused from her
numbness enough to raise an eyebrow at the decisiveness in
Maighdin&rsquo;s voice. Faile merely looked at her maid, but that
was enough to set Maighdin blushing and stammering. What had gotten
into the woman? Still, it might not be what she expected from a
serving woman, but she could not fault Maighdin&rsquo;s spirit in a
companion for escape. A pity the woman could not channel more.
Faile had had great hopes of that once, until she learned that
Maighdin possessed so little ability it was useless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tonight it must be, Maighdin,&rdquo; she agreed. Or
however many nights it took. She did not mention that. Hurriedly
she surveyed the people nearest them to make sure no one was close
enough to overhear. The Shaido, whether in <em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em>
or not, moved through the falling snow purposefully, pressing
forward toward an unseen goal. The <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>&mdash;the other <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>&mdash;moved with a different
purpose. Obey or be punished. &ldquo;The way they ignore us,&rdquo; she went
on, &ldquo;it should be possible to just fall by the wayside, so long as
you don&rsquo;t try under a Shaido&rsquo;s nose. If either of you
finds a chance, take it. These robes will help you hide in the
snow, and once you find a village, the gold they&rsquo;ve so
graciously given us will see you back to my husband. He will be
following.&rdquo; Not too quickly, she hoped. Not too closely, at least.
The Shaido had an army here. A small army, perhaps, compared to
some, but larger than Perrin&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Alliandre&rsquo;s face hardened in determination. &ldquo;I
will not leave without you,&rdquo; she said softly. Softly, yet in firm
tones. &ldquo;I will not take my oath of fealty lightly, my Lady. I will
escape with you, or not at all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She speaks for both of us,&rdquo; Maighdin said. &ldquo;I may be
only a simple maid,&rdquo; she wrung the word with scorn, &ldquo;but I
won&rsquo;t leave anyone behind to these&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;these bandits!&rdquo; Her
voice was not simply firm; it brooked no opposition. Really, after
this, Lini would have to have a very long talk with her before she
was fit to hold her position!</p>

<p>Faile opened her mouth to argue&mdash;no, to
command; Alliandre was her sworn woman, and Maighdin her maid,
however fire-brained captivity had made her! They <em>would</em>
follow her orders!&mdash;but she let the words die on her
tongue.</p>

<p>Dark shapes approaching through the tide of Shaido
and the falling snow resolved into a cluster of Aielwomen with
their shawls framing their faces. Therava led them. A murmured word
from her, and the others slowed to keep pace behind while Therava
joined Faile and her companions. That was to say, she walked
alongside them. Her fierce eyes seemed to chill even
Maighdin&rsquo;s enthusiasm, not that she gave them more than a
glance. To her, they were not worth looking at.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are thinking of escape,&rdquo; she began. No one else
opened her mouth, but the Wise One added, &ldquo;Do not try denying it!&rdquo;
in a scornful voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will try to serve as we should, Wise One,&rdquo; Faile
said carefully. She kept her head down in her cowl and made sure
not to meet the taller woman&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know something of our ways.&rdquo; Therava sounded
surprised, but it vanished quickly. &ldquo;Good. But you take me for a
fool if you think I believe you will serve meekly. I see spirit in
the three of you, for wetlanders. Some never try to escape, but
only the dead succeed. The living are always brought back.
Always.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will heed your words, Wise One,&rdquo; Faile said
humbly. Always? Well, there had to be a first time. &ldquo;We all
will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, <em>very</em> good,&rdquo; Therava murmured. &ldquo;You
might even convince someone as blind as Sevanna. Know this,
however, <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>. Wetlanders are not as others who
wear white. Rather than being released at the end of a year and a
day, you will serve until you are too bent and withered to work. I
am your only hope of avoiding that fate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faile stumbled in the snow, and if Alliandre and
Maighdin had not caught her windmilling arms, she would have
fallen. Therava gestured impatiently for them to keep moving. Faile
felt sick. <em>Therava</em> would help them escape? Chiad and Bain
claimed the Aiel knew nothing of the Game of Houses and scorned
wetlanders for playing it, but Faile recognized the currents
swirling around her now. Currents that would pull all of them under
if she misstepped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not understand, Wise One.&rdquo; She wished her voice
did not sound so hoarse, suddenly.</p>

<p>Perhaps that very hoarseness convinced Therava,
though. People like her believed in fear as a motivation before any
other. At any rate, she smiled. It was not a warm smile, just a
curving of thin lips, and the only emotion it conveyed was
satisfaction. &ldquo;All three of you will watch and listen while you
serve Sevanna. Each day a Wise One will question you, and you will
repeat every word Sevanna said, and who she spoke to. If she talks
in her sleep, you will repeat what she mumbles. Please me, and I
will see that you are left behind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faile wanted no part of this, but refusal was out of
the question. If she refused, none of them would survive the night.
She was certain of that. Therava would take no chances. They might
not even survive until nightfall; this snow would hide three
white-clad corpses quickly, and she very much doubted that anyone
within sight would so much as protest if Therava decided to slit a
few throats then and there. Everyone was focused on moving forward
through the snow in any case. They might not even see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she learns of it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo; Faile swallowed. The
woman was asking them to walk out on a crumbling cliff. No, she was
ordering them to. Did the Aiel kill spies? She had never thought to
ask Chiad or Bain that. &ldquo;Will you protect us, Wise One?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hard-faced woman caught Faile&rsquo;s chin with
steely fingers, pulling her to a halt, pulling her up on her toes.
Therava&rsquo;s eyes caught hers just as tightly. Faile&rsquo;s mouth
went dry. That stare promised pain. &ldquo;If she learns of it, <em>
gai&rsquo;shain</em>, I will trice you up for cooking myself. So
make sure she does not. Tonight you will serve in her tents. You
and a hundred others, so you will not have many labors to distract
you from what is important.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A moment&rsquo;s careful study of the three of them,
and Therava gave a satisfied nod. She saw three soft wetlanders,
too weak to do anything but obey. Without another word she released
Faile and turned away, and in moments she and the other Wise Ones
were swallowed by the snow.</p>

<p>For a time, the three women struggled on in silence.
Faile did not bring up anyone escaping alone, much less give
orders. She was certain that if she did, the others would balk
again. Aside from anything else, complying now would make it seem
Therava had changed their minds, that fear of her had. Faile knew
enough of the other two women to be sure they would die before
admitting that the woman frightened them. Therava certainly
frightened her. <em>And I&rsquo;d swallow my tongue before admitting
it aloud</em>, she thought wryly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what she meant by&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;cooking,&rdquo; Alliandre
said finally. &ldquo;Whitecloak Questioners sometimes turn prisoners over
a fire on a spit, I&rsquo;ve heard.&rdquo; Maighdin wrapped her arms
around herself, shuddering, and Alliandre freed a hand from her
sleeves long enough to pat the other woman&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Do not
worry. If Sevanna has a hundred servants, we may never get close
enough to hear anything. And we can choose what we report, so it
cannot be traced back to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maighdin laughed bitterly inside her white hood. &ldquo;You
think we still have small choices. We have none. You need to learn
about having no choices. That woman didn&rsquo;t pick us out because
we have <em>spirit</em>.&rdquo; She almost spat the word. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
wager every one of Sevanna&rsquo;s <em>other</em> servants has had
that lecture from Therava, too. If we miss a word we should have
heard, you can be sure she&rsquo;ll know of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may be right,&rdquo; Alliandre allowed after a moment.
&ldquo;But you will not speak to me again in that fashion, Maighdin. Our
circumstances are trying, to say the least, but you <em>will</em>
remember who I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Until we escape,&rdquo; Maighdin replied, &ldquo;you are
Sevanna&rsquo;s servant. If you don&rsquo;t think of yourself as a
servant every minute, then you might as well climb onto that spit.
And leave room for the rest of us, because you will put us on it,
as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alliandre&rsquo;s cowl hid her face, but her back grew
stiffer with every word. She was intelligent, and knew how to do
what she must, but she had a queen&rsquo;s temper when she did not
control it.</p>

<p>Faile spoke before she could erupt. &ldquo;Until we manage
to get away, we are <em>all</em> servants,&rdquo; she said firmly. Light,
the last thing she needed was the pair of them squabbling. &ldquo;But you
will apologize, Maighdin. Now!&rdquo; Head averted, her serving woman
mumbled something that might have been an apology. She let it pass
for one, in any case. &ldquo;As for you, Alliandre, I expect you to be a
good servant.&rdquo; Alliandre made a noise, a half-protest, that Faile
ignored. &ldquo;If we are to have any chance of escape, we must do as we
are told, work hard, and attract as little attention as possible.&rdquo;
As if they had not already attracted what seemed all the attention
in the world. &ldquo;And we will tell Therava every time Sevanna sneezes.
I don&rsquo;t know what Sevanna will do if she finds out, but I
think we all have a good idea of what Therava will do if we
displease her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was enough to settle them all back into
muteness. They did all have a good idea of what Therava would do,
and killing might not be the worst of it.</p>

<p>The snow faded away to a few scattered flakes by
midday. Dark roiling clouds still hid the sun, but Faile decided it
must be near enough midday, because they were fed. No one stopped
moving, but hundreds of <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> made their way
through the column with baskets and scrips full of bread and dried
beef, and water bags that contained water this time, cold enough to
make her teeth ache. Strangely, she felt no more hungry than hours
of walking through snow would account for. Perrin had been Healed
once, she knew, and he had been ravenous for two days. Perhaps it
was because her injuries had been so much less than his. She
noticed that Alliandre and Maighdin ate no more than she.</p>

<p>Healing made her think of Galina, all the same
questions that boiled down to an incredulous <em>why</em>? Why
would an Aes Sedai&mdash;she <em>must</em> be Aes Sedai&mdash;why
would she toady for Sevanna and Therava? For anyone? An Aes Sedai
might help them escape. Or she might not. She might betray them, if
it suited her purposes. Aes Sedai did what they did, and you had no
alternative but to accept that unless you were Rand al&rsquo;Thor.
But he was <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, and the Dragon Reborn on top of
it; she was a woman with very few resources at the moment, and a
considerable danger hanging over her head. Not to mention the heads
of those she was responsible for. Any help would be welcome, from
anyone. The brisk breeze failed while she prodded at Galina from
every angle she could think of, and the snow came again, growing
heavier, until she could not see ten paces. She could not decide
whether to trust the woman.</p>

<p>Abruptly she became aware of another white-robed
woman watching her, almost hidden by the snow. Not enough snow to
mask that wide, jeweled belt, though. Faile touched her companions
on the arm and nodded toward Galina.</p>

<p>When Galina saw she had been seen, she came to trudge
along between Faile and Alliandre. She still did not move with any
grace in the snow, but she seemed more used to walking in it than
they. There was nothing of fawning about her, now. Her round face
was hard within her hood, her eyes sharp. But she did keep turning
her head, darting wary glances to see who else was nearby. She
looked like a housecat pretending to be a leopard. &ldquo;You know who I
am?&rdquo; she demanded, but in a voice that would have been inaudible
ten feet off. &ldquo;What I am?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem to be Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Faile said carefully. &ldquo;On
the other hand, you have a very peculiar place here for an Aes
Sedai.&rdquo; Neither Alliandre nor Maighdin gave the slightest start of
surprise. Plainly they had already seen the Great Serpent ring that
Galina was thumbing nervously.</p>

<p>Color bloomed in Galina&rsquo;s cheeks, and she tried
to make it out as anger. &ldquo;What I do here is of great importance to
the Tower, child,&rdquo; she said coldly. Her expression said she had
reasons they could not begin to comprehend. Her eyes darted, trying
to pierce the falling snow. &ldquo;I must not fail. That is all you need
to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We need to know whether we can trust you,&rdquo; Alliandre
said calmly. &ldquo;You must have trained in the Tower or you would not
know Healing, but women earn the ring without earning the shawl,
and I cannot believe you are Aes Sedai.&rdquo; It seemed Faile had not
been the only one puzzling over the woman.</p>

<p>Galina&rsquo;s plump mouth hardened, and she clenched
a fist at Alliandre, to threaten or show her ring, or both. &ldquo;You
think they will treat you differently because you wear a crown?
Because you used to wear one?&rdquo; There was no doubt of her anger,
now. She forgot to keep lockout for listeners, and her voice was
acid. Spittle flew with the force of her tirade. &ldquo;You will bring
Sevanna wine and wash her back just like the rest. Her servants are
all nobles, or rich merchants, or men and women who know how to
serve nobles. Every day she has five of them strapped, to encourage
the rest, so they all carry tales to her hoping to curry favor. The
first time you try to escape, they will switch the soles of your
feet until you cannot walk, and tie you twisted up like a
blacksmith&rsquo;s puzzle to carry on a cart until you can. The
second time will be worse, and the third worse again. There is a
fellow here who used to be a Whitecloak. He tried to escape nine
times. A hard man, but the last time they brought him back, he was
begging and crying before they even began stripping him for
punishment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alliandre did not take the harangue well. She puffed
up indignantly, and Maighdin growled, &ldquo;Was that what happened to
you? Whether Aes Sedai or Accepted, you are a disgrace to the
Tower!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be silent when your betters speak, wilder!&rdquo; Galina
snapped.</p>

<p>Light, if this went any further, they would be
screaming at one another next. &ldquo;If you mean to help us escape, then
say so,&rdquo; Faile told the silk-clad Aes Sedai. She did not really
doubt that about the woman. Just everything else. &ldquo;If not, what do
you want with us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ahead of them a wagon loomed out of the snow, leaning
where one of the sleds had come loose. Directed by a Shaido with
the arms and shoulders of a blacksmith, <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>
were rigging a lever to hoist the wagon enough for the sled to be
lashed back in place. Faile and the others kept silent as they
passed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this really your liege lady, Alliandre?&rdquo; Galina
demanded once they were out of earshot of the men around the wagon.
Her face was still flushed with anger, her tone slicing. &ldquo;Who is
she that you would swear to her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can ask me,&rdquo; Faile said coldly. Burn Aes Sedai
and their bloody secrecy! Sometimes she thought an Aes Sedai would
not tell you the sky was blue unless she saw advantage in it. &ldquo;I am
the Lady Faile t&rsquo;Aybara, and that&rsquo;s as much as <em>
you</em> need to know. Do you mean to help us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Galina stumbled to one knee, peering at Faile so hard
that she began to wonder whether she had made a mistake. A moment
later, she knew she had.</p>

<p>Regaining her feet, the Aes Sedai smiled
unpleasantly. She no longer seemed angry. In fact, she looked as
pleased as Therava had, and worse, in much the same way.
&ldquo;t&rsquo;Aybara,&rdquo; she mused. &ldquo;You are Saldaean. There is a young
man, Perrin Aybara. Your husband? Yes, I see I&rsquo;ve hit the
target. That would explain Alliandre&rsquo;s oath, certainly.
Sevanna has grandiose plans for a man whose name is linked to your
husband. Rand al&rsquo;Thor. If she knew she had you in her hands&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Oh, never fear she will learn from me.&rdquo; Her gaze hardened, and
suddenly she seemed a leopard in truth. A starving leopard. &ldquo;Not if
you all do as I tell you. I will even help you get away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want of us?&rdquo; Faile said, more
insistently than she felt. Light, she had been angry at Alliandre
for drawing attention to them by naming herself, and now she had
done the same. Or worse. <em>And I thought I was concealing myself
by hiding my father&rsquo;s name</em>, she thought bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing too trying,&rdquo; Galina replied. &ldquo;You marked
Therava, of course? Of course, you did. Everyone notices Therava.
She keeps something in her tent, a smooth white rod about a foot
long. It is in a red chest with brass banding that is never locked.
Bring it to me, and I will take you with me when I go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A small thing to do, it seems,&rdquo; Alliandre said
doubtfully. &ldquo;But if so, why do you not take it yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I have you to fetch it for me!&rdquo; Realizing
she had shouted, Galina huddled in on herself, and her cowl swung
as she searched for eavesdroppers among the snow-veiled throng. No
one seemed to be so much as glancing their way, but her voice
dropped to a feral hiss. &ldquo;If you do not, I will leave you here
until you are gray and wrinkled. And Sevanna will hear of Perrin
Aybara.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may take time,&rdquo; Faile said desperately. &ldquo;We
won&rsquo;t be free to just sneak into Therava&rsquo;s tent whenever
we want.&rdquo; Light, the last thing in the world she wanted was to go
anywhere near Therava&rsquo;s tent. But Galina had said she would
help them. Vile she might be, but Aes Sedai could not lie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have all the time you need,&rdquo; Galina replied.
&ldquo;The rest of your life, Lady Faile t&rsquo;Aybara, if you are not
careful. Do not fail me.&rdquo; She gave Faile a last hard stare, then
turned to labor away into the snow, holding her arms as if trying
to hide her jeweled belt behind her wide sleeves.</p>

<p>Faile struggled onward in silence. Neither of her
companions had anything to say, either. There did not seem to be
anything to say. Alliandre appeared sunk in thought, hands in her
sleeves, peering straight ahead as if seeing something beyond the
blizzard. Maighdin had gone back to gripping her golden collar in a
tight fist. They were caught in three snares, not one, and any of
the three might kill. Rescue suddenly seemed very attractive.
Somehow, though, Faile intended to find her way out of this trap.
Pulling her hand away from her own collar, she fought through the
snowstorm, planning.</p>
