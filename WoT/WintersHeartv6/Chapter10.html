<h4><em>A Plan Succeeds</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">E</span>layne&rsquo;s
eyes opened in darkness, staring at dim
shadows dancing on misty paleness. Her face was cold, the rest of
her hot and sweaty, and something confined her arms and legs. For
an instant panic flared. Then she sensed Aviendha&rsquo;s presence
in the room, a simple, comforting awareness, and Birgitte&rsquo;s, a
fist of calm, controlled anger in her head. They soothed her by
being there. She was in her own bedchamber, lying beneath blankets
in her own bed and staring up at the taut linen canopy with
hot-water bottles packed along her sides. The heavy winter
bed-curtains were tied back against the carved posts, and the only
light in the room came from tiny flickering flames in the
fireplace, just enough to make shadows shift, not dispel them.</p>

<p>Without thought she reached out for the Source and
found it. Touched <em>saidar</em>, wondrously, without drawing on
it. The desire to draw deeply welled up strong in her, but
reluctantly she retreated. Oh, so reluctantly, and not just
because her wanting to be filled with the deeper life of <em>
saidar</em> was often a bottomless need that must be controlled.
Her greatest fear during those endless minutes of terror had not
been death, but that she would never touch the Source again. Once,
she would have thought that strange.</p>

<p>Abruptly, memory returned, and she sat up unsteadily,
the blankets sliding to her waist. Immediately, she pulled them
back up. The air was cold against her bare skin slick with sweat.
They had not even left her a shift, and try as she would to copy
Aviendha&rsquo;s ease about being unclothed in front of others, she
could not manage it. &ldquo;Dyelin,&rdquo; she said anxiously, twisting to
drape the blankets around herself better. It was an awkward
operation; she felt wrung out and more than a little wobbly. &ldquo;And
the Guardsman. Are they&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man didn&rsquo;t suffer a scratch,&rdquo; Nynaeve said,
stepping out of the shifting shadows, a shadow herself. She rested
her hand on Elayne&rsquo;s forehead and grunted in satisfaction at
finding it cool. &ldquo;I Healed Dyelin. She will need time to recover
her strength fully, though. She lost a great deal of blood. You are
doing well, too. For a time, I thought you were taking a fever.
That can come on suddenly when you&rsquo;re weakened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She gave you herbs instead of Healing,&rdquo; Birgitte
said sourly from a chair at the foot of the bed. In the near
darkness, she was just a squat, ominous shape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara is wise enough to know what
she cannot do,&rdquo; Aviendha said in level tones. Only her white blouse
and a flash of polished silver were really visible, low against the
wall. As usual, she had chosen the floor over a chair. &ldquo;She
recognized the taste of this forkroot in the tea and did not know
how to work her weaves against it, so she did not take foolish
chances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve sniffed sharply. No doubt as much at
Aviendha&rsquo;s defense of her as Birgitte&rsquo;s acidity. Perhaps
more so. Nynaeve being Nynaeve, she probably would have preferred
to let slide what she did not know and could not do. And she was
more prickly than usual about Healing, of late. Ever since it
became clear that several of the Kin were already outstripping her
skill. &ldquo;You should have recognized it yourself, Elayne,&rdquo; she said
in a brusque voice. &ldquo;At any rate, greenwort and goatstongue might
make you sleep, but they&rsquo;re sovereign for stomach cramps. I
thought you would prefer the sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fishing leather hot-water bottles from under the
covers and dropping them onto the carpets so she did not start
roasting again, Elayne shuddered. The days right after Ronde Macura
dosed her and Nynaeve with forkroot had been a misery she had tried
to forget. Whatever the herbs were that Nynaeve had given her, she
felt no weaker than the forkroot would have made her. She thought
she could walk, so long as she did not have to walk far or stand
long. And she could think clearly. The casements showed only thin
moonlight. How deeply into the night was it?</p>

<p>Embracing the Source again, she channeled four
threads of Fire to light first one stand-lamp, then a second. The
small, mirrored flames brightened the room greatly after the
darkness, and Birgitte put a hand up to shield her eyes, at first.
The Captain-General&rsquo;s coat truly did suit her; she would have
impressed the merchants no end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should not be channeling yet,&rdquo; Nynaeve fussed,
squinting at the sudden light. She still wore the same low-cut blue
dress Elayne had seen her in earlier, with her yellow-fringed shawl
caught in her elbows. &ldquo;A few days to regain strength would be best,
with plenty of sleep.&rdquo; She frowned at the hot-water bottles tumbled
on the floor. &ldquo;And you need to be kept warm. Better to avoid a
fever than need to Heal it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think Dyelin proved her loyalty today,&rdquo; Elayne
said, shifting her pillows so she could lean back against the
headboard, and Nynaeve threw up her hands in disgust. A small
silver tray on one of the side tables flanking the bed held a
single silver cup filled with dark wine that Elayne gave a brief,
mistrusting look. &ldquo;A hard way to prove it. I think I have <em>
toh</em> toward her, Aviendha.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha shrugged. On their arrival in Caemlyn she
had returned to Aiel garments with almost laughable haste,
forsaking silks for <em>algode</em> blouses and bulky woolen skirts
as though suddenly afraid of wetlander luxury. With a dark shawl
tied around her waist and a dark folded kerchief holding her long
hair back, she was the image of a Wise One&rsquo;s apprentice,
though her only jewelry was a complicated silver necklace of
intricately worked discs, a gift from Egwene. Elayne still did not
understand her hurry. Melaine and the others had seemed willing to
let her go her own way so long as she wore wetlander clothes, but
now they had her back in their grip as tightly as any novice in the
hands of Aes Sedai. The only reason they allowed her to stay any
time at all in the Palace&mdash;in the city, for that matter&mdash;was that she and Elayne were first-sisters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you think you do, then you do.&rdquo; Her tones of
pointing out the obvious slid into an affectionate chiding. &ldquo;But a
small <em>toh</em>, Elayne. You had reason to doubt. You cannot
assume obligation for every thought, sister.&rdquo; She laughed as if
suddenly seeing a wonderful joke. &ldquo;That way lies too much pride,
and I will have to be overproud with you, only the Wise Ones will
not call to you to account for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve rolled her eyes ostentatiously, but Aviendha
simply shook her head, wearily patient with the other woman&rsquo;s
ignorance. She had been studying more than the Power with the Wise
Ones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we wouldn&rsquo;t want the pair of you being
too proud,&rdquo; Birgitte said with what sounded suspiciously like
suppressed mirth. Her face was much too smooth, almost rigid with
the effort of not laughing.</p>

<p>Aviendha eyed Birgitte with a wooden-faced wariness.
Since she and Elayne had adopted one another, Birgitte had adopted
her, too, in way. Not as a Warder, of course, but with the same
elder-sister attitude she often displayed toward Elayne. Aviendha
was not quite sure what to make of it, or how to respond. Joining
the tiny circle who knew who Birgitte really was certainly had not
helped. She bounced between fierce determination to show that
Birgitte Silverbow did not overawe her and a startling meekness,
with odd stops in between.</p>

<p>Birgitte smiled at her, an amused smile, but it faded
as she picked up a narrow bundle from her lap and began unfolding
the cloth with great care. By the time she revealed a dagger with a
leather-wrapped hilt and a long blade, her expression was severe,
and tight anger flowed through the bond. Elayne recognized the
knife instantly; she had last seen its twin in the hand of a
tow-headed assassin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were not trying to kidnap you, sister,&rdquo;
Aviendha said softly.</p>

<p>Birgitte&rsquo;s tone was grim. &ldquo;After Mellar killed
the first two&mdash;the second by spearing him with his sword
across the width of the room like somebody in a bloody
gleeman&rsquo;s tale,&rdquo; she held the dagger upright by the end of the
hilt, &ldquo;he took this from the last fellow and killed him with it.
They had four near identical daggers between them. This one is
poisoned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those brown stains on the blade are gray fennel
mixed with powdered peach pit,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, sitting down on the
edge of the bed, and grimaced in disgust. &ldquo;One look at his eyes and
tongue, and I knew that was what killed the fellow, not the
knife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Elayne said quietly after a moment. Well,
indeed. &ldquo;Forkroot so I couldn&rsquo;t channel, or stand up, for that
matter, and two men to hold me on my feet while the third put a
poisoned dagger in me. A complicated plan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wetlanders like complicated plans,&rdquo; Aviendha said.
Glancing at Birgitte uneasily, she shifted against the wall and
added, &ldquo;Some do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simple, in its way,&rdquo; Birgitte said, rewrapping the
knife with as great a care as she had shown unwrapping. &ldquo;You were
easy to reach. Everyone knows you eat your midday meal alone.&rdquo; Her
long braid swung as she shook her head. &ldquo;A lucky thing the first
man to reach you didn&rsquo;t have this; one stab, and you&rsquo;d be
dead. A lucky thing Mellar happened to be walking by and heard a
man cursing in your rooms. Enough luck for a <em>
ta&rsquo;veren</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve snorted. &ldquo;You might be dead from a deep
enough cut on your <em>arm</em>. The pit is the most poisonous part
of a peach. Dyelin wouldn&rsquo;t have had a chance if the other
blades had been poisoned as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne looked around at her friends&rsquo; flat,
expressionless faces and sighed. A <em>very</em> complicated plan.
As if spies in the Palace were not bad enough. &ldquo;A <em>small</em>
bodyguard, Birgitte,&rdquo; she said finally. &ldquo;Something&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;discreet.&rdquo;
She should have known the woman would be prepared. Birgitte&rsquo;s
face did not change in the slightest, but the tiniest burst of
satisfaction flared through their shared bond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The women who guarded you today, for a start,&rdquo; she
said, without so much as <em>pretending</em> to pause for thought,
&ldquo;and a few more that I&rsquo;ll pick. Maybe twenty or so,
altogether. Too few can&rsquo;t protect you day and night, and you
bloody well must be,&rdquo; she put in firmly, though Elayne had not
offered any protest. &ldquo;Women can guard you where men can&rsquo;t, and
they&rsquo;ll be discreet just by being who they are. Most people
will think they&rsquo;re ceremonial&mdash;your very own Maidens of
the Spear&mdash;and we&rsquo;ll give them something, a sash maybe,
to make them look more so.&rdquo; That earned her a very sharp look from
Aviendha, which she affected not to notice. &ldquo;The problem is who to
command,&rdquo; she said, frowning in thought. &ldquo;Two or three nobles,
Hunters, are already arguing for rank &lsquo;sufficient to their
station.&rsquo; The bloody women know how to give orders, but
I&rsquo;m not sure they know the right bloody orders to give. I
could promote Caseille to lieutenant, but she&rsquo;s more a
bannerman at heart, I think.&rdquo; Birgitte shrugged. &ldquo;Maybe one of the
others will show promise, but I think they are better followers
than leaders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh, yes; all thought out. Twenty or so? She would
have to keep a close eye on Birgitte to make sure the number did
not climb to fifty. Or more. Able to guard her where men could not.
Elayne winced. That probably meant guards watching her bathe at the
very least. &ldquo;Caseille will do, surely. A bannerman can handle
twenty.&rdquo; She was certain she could talk Caseille into keeping it
all unobtrusive. And keeping the guards outside while she took a
bath. &ldquo;The man who arrived just in the nick of time. Mellar? What
do you know of him, Birgitte?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doilin Mellar,&rdquo; Birgitte said slowly, her brows
drawing down as a sharp angle. &ldquo;A coldhearted fellow, though he
smiles a lot. Mainly at women. He pinches serving girls, and
he&rsquo;s tumbled three in four days that I know of&mdash;he likes
to talk about his &lsquo;conquests&rsquo;&mdash;but he hasn&rsquo;t
pressed anyone who said no. He claims to have been a
merchant&rsquo;s guard and then a mercenary, and now a Hunter for
the Horn, and he certainly has the skills. Enough that I made him a
lieutenant. He&rsquo;s Andoran, from somewhere out west, near
Baerlon, and he says he fought for your mother during the
Succession, though he couldn&rsquo;t have been much more than a boy
at the time. Anyway, he knows the right answers&mdash;I checked&mdash;so maybe he was involved in it. Mercenaries lie about their
pasts without thinking twice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Folding her hands on her middle, Elayne considered
Doilin Mellar. She remembered only the impression of a wiry man
with a sharp face, choking one of her assailants while they
struggled over the poisoned dagger. A man with enough of a
soldier&rsquo;s skills that Birgitte had made him an officer. She
was trying to make sure that as many as possible of the officers,
at least, were Andoran. A rescue just in time, one man against
three, and a sword hurled across the room like a spear; very much
like a gleeman&rsquo;s tale. &ldquo;He deserves a suitable reward. A
promotion to captain and command of my bodyguard, Birgitte.
Caseille can be his second.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you mad?&rdquo; Nynaeve burst out, but Elayne shushed
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll feel much safer knowing he&rsquo;s there,
Nynaeve. He won&rsquo;t try pinching <em>me</em>, not with Caseille
and twenty more like her around him. With his reputation,
they&rsquo;ll watch him like hawks. You did say twenty, Birgitte? I
will hold you to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twenty,&rdquo; Birgitte said absently. &ldquo;Or so.&rdquo; There was
nothing absent about the gaze she fixed on Elayne, though. She
leaned forward intently, hands on her knees. &ldquo;I suppose you know
what you&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo; Good; she was going to behave like a
Warder for once instead of arguing. &ldquo;Guardsman-Lieutenant Mellar
becomes Guardsman-Captain Mellar, for saving the life of the
Daughter-Heir. That will add to his swagger. Unless you think
it&rsquo;s better to keep the whole thing secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne shook her head. &ldquo;Oh, no; not at all. Let the
whole city know. Someone tried to murder me, and Lieutenant&mdash;Captain&mdash;Mellar saved my life. We <em>will</em> keep the
poison to ourselves, though. Just in case someone makes a slip of
the tongue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve harrumphed and gave her a sidelong glare.
&ldquo;One day you will be too clever, Elayne. So sharp you cut
yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is clever, Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara.&rdquo; Rising
smoothly to her feet, Aviendha settled her heavy skirts, then
patted her horn-hilted belt knife. It was not so large as the blade
she had worn as a Maiden, yet still a credible weapon. &ldquo;And she has
me to watch her back. I have permission to stay with her, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve opened her mouth angrily. And for a wonder,
closed it again, composing herself visibly, smoothing her skirts
and her features. &ldquo;What are you all staring at?&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;If
Elayne wants this fellow close enough to pinch her whenever he
feels like, who am I to argue?&rdquo; Birgitte&rsquo;s mouth dropped open,
and Elayne wondered whether Aviendha was going to choke. Her eyes
were certainly popping.</p>

<p>The faint sound of the gong atop the Palace&rsquo;s
tallest tower, tolling the hour, made her jerk. It was later than
she had thought. &ldquo;Nynaeve, Egwene might already be waiting for us.&rdquo;
None of her clothes were anywhere to be seen. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my
purse? My ring is in it.&rdquo; Her Great Serpent ring was on her finger,
but that was not the one she meant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will see Egwene alone,&rdquo; Nynaeve said firmly. &ldquo;You
are in no condition to enter <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. In
any case, you just slept the afternoon away. You won&rsquo;t go to
sleep again soon, I&rsquo;ll wager. And I know you&rsquo;ve had no
luck putting yourself into a waking trance, so that is that.&rdquo; She
smiled smugly, certain of her victory. <em>She</em> had gone
cross-eyed and dizzy attempting to enter the waking trance Egwene
had tried to teach them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll wager that, will you?&rdquo; Elayne murmured.
&ldquo;What will you bet? Because I intend to drink that,&rdquo; she glanced at
the silver cup on the sidetable, &ldquo;and <em>I</em> wager I&rsquo;ll go
right to sleep. Of course, if you <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> put
something in it, if you didn&rsquo;t intend trying to trick me into
drinking it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Well, of course, you wouldn&rsquo;t do that. So
what shall we wager?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That insufferable smile slid greasily off
Nynaeve&rsquo;s face, replaced by bright spots of color in her
cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fine thing,&rdquo; Birgitte said, standing. Fists on
hips, she squared herself at the foot of the bed, her face and tone
alike censuring. &ldquo;The woman saves you a roiling belly, and you snip
at her like Mistress Priss. Maybe if you drink that cup and go to
sleep and forget about adventuring in the World of Dreams tonight,
I&rsquo;ll decide you&rsquo;ve grown up enough that I can trust fewer
than a hundred guards to keep you alive. Or do I need to hold your
nose to make you drink?&rdquo; Well, Elayne had not expected her to keep
holding back for long. Fewer than a hundred?</p>

<p>Aviendha spun to face Birgitte before she finished,
and barely waited for the last word to leave the other woman&rsquo;s
mouth. &ldquo;You should not speak to her so, Birgitte Trahelion,&rdquo; she
said, drawing herself to gain the full advantage other greater
height. Given the raised heels on Birgitte&rsquo;s boots, it was not
that much, yet with her shawl drawn tightly over her breasts, she
looked very much a Wise One rather than an apprentice. Some had
faces not much older than hers. &ldquo;You are her Warder. Ask <em>
Aan&rsquo;allein</em> how to behave. He is a great man, yet he obeys
as Nynaeve tells him.&rdquo; <em>Aan&rsquo;allein</em> was Lan, The Man
Alone, his story well known and much admired among the Aiel.</p>

<p>Birgitte eyed her up and down as if measuring her,
and adopted a lounging posture that all but lost the extra inches
of her boot heels. With a mocking grin, she opened her mouth,
plainly ready to prick Aviendha&rsquo;s bubble if she could. She
usually could. Before she said a word, Nynaeve spoke quietly and
quite firmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, for the love of the Light, give over, Birgitte.
If Elayne says she&rsquo;s going, then she is going. Now, not
another word out of you.&rdquo; She stabbed a finger at the other woman.
&ldquo;Or you and I will have words, later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Birgitte stared at Nynaeve, her mouth working
soundlessly, the Warder bond carrying an intense blend of
irritation and frustration. At last, she flung herself back into
her chair, legs sprawled and boots balanced on her lion-head spurs,
and began a sullen muttering under her breath. If Elayne had not
known her better, she would have sworn the woman was sulking. She
wished she knew how Nynaeve did it. Once, Nynaeve had been as much
in awe of Birgitte as Aviendha ever was, but that had changed.
Completely. Now Nynaeve bullied Birgitte as readily as anyone else.
And more successfully than with most. <em>She&rsquo;s a woman just
like any other</em>, Nynaeve had said. <em>She told me so herself,
and I realized she was right</em>. As if <em>that</em> explained
anything. Birgitte was still Birgitte.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My purse?&rdquo; Elayne said, and of all people, Birgitte
went to fetch the gold-embroidered red purse from the dressing
room. Well, a Warder did do that sort of thing, but Birgitte always
made some comment when she did. Though perhaps her return was meant
for one. She presented the purse to Elayne with a flourishing bow.
And a twist of her lips for Nynaeve and Aviendha. Elayne sighed. It
was not that the other women disliked one another; they really got
on very well, if you ignored their little foibles. They just rubbed
against each other sometimes.</p>

<p>The oddly twisted stone ring, strung on a plain loop
of leather, lay in the bottom of the purse underneath a mix of
coins, next to the carefully folded silk handkerchief full of
feathers she considered her greatest treasure. The <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em> appeared to be stone, anyway, all flecks and
stripes of blue and red and brown, but it felt as hard and slick as
steel, and too heavy even for that. Settling the leather cord
around her neck, and the ring between her breasts, she pulled the
drawstrings tight and set the purse on the side table, taking up
the silver cup instead. The fragrance was simply that of good wine,
but she raised an eyebrow anyway and smiled at Nynaeve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go to my own room,&rdquo; Nynaeve said stiffly.
Rising from the mattress, she shared out a stern look between
Birgitte and Aviendha. Somehow, the <em>ki&rsquo;sain</em> on her
forehead made it seem even more uncompromising. &ldquo;The pair of you
stay awake and keep your eyes open! Until you have those women
around her, she is still in danger. And after, I hope I don&rsquo;t
have to remind you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think I do not know that?&rdquo; Aviendha protested at
the same time that Birgitte growled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a fool,
Nynaeve!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you say,&rdquo; Nynaeve answered them both. &ldquo;I hope so,
for Elayne&rsquo;s sake. And for your own.&rdquo; Gathering her shawl, she
glided from the room, as stately as any Aes Sedai could wish to be.
She was getting very good at that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d think she was the bloody queen here,&rdquo;
Birgitte muttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is the one who is overproud, Birgitte
Trahelion,&rdquo; Aviendha grumbled. &ldquo;As proud as a Shaido with one
goat.&rdquo; They nodded at one another in perfect agreement.</p>

<p>But Elayne noticed that they had waited to speak
until the door had shut behind Nynaeve. The woman who had denied so
hard wanting to be Aes Sedai was becoming very much Aes Sedai.
Perhaps Lan had something to with that. Coaching her, from his
experience. She still had to work at staying composed, sometimes,
but it seemed to come more and more easily since her peculiar
wedding.</p>

<p>The first sip of the wine had no taste other than
wine, a very good wine, but Elayne frowned at the cup and
hesitated. Until she realized what she was doing, and why. The
memory of forkroot hidden in her tea was still strong. What had
Nynaeve put in here? Not forkroot, of course, but what? Raising the
cup to take a full swallow seemed very difficult. Defiantly, she
drained the wine. <em>I was thirsty, that&rsquo;s all</em>, she
thought, stretching to set the cup back on the silver tray. <em>I
certainly wasn&rsquo;t trying to</em> prove <em>anything</em>.</p>

<p>The other two women had been watching her, but as she
began settling herself in a more comfortable position for sleep,
they turned to one another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep watch in the sitting room,&rdquo; Birgitte
said. &ldquo;I have my bow and quiver in there. You stay here in case she
needs you for anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rather than arguing, Aviendha drew her belt knife and
knelt ready to spring up again, off to one side, where she would
see anyone coming through the door before they saw her. &ldquo;Knock
twice, then once, and name yourself before you enter,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Otherwise, I will assume it is an enemy.&rdquo; And Birgitte nodded as
if that were the most reasonable thing in the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is sil&mdash;&rdquo; Elayne smothered a yawn behind
her hand. &ldquo;Silly,&rdquo; she finished when she could speak again. &ldquo;No one
is going to try to&mdash;&rdquo; Another yawn, and she could have put
her fist into her mouth! Light, what <em>had</em> Nynaeve put in
that wine? &ldquo;To kill me&mdash;tonight,&rdquo; she said drowsily, &ldquo;and you&mdash;both know&mdash;&rdquo; Her eyelids were leaden, sliding down
despite every effort to keep them open. Unconsciously snuggling her
face into her pillow, she tried to finish what she had been about
to say, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She was in the Grand Hall, the throne room of the
Palace. In the Grand Hall&rsquo;s reflection in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. Here, the twisted stone ring that
felt too heavy for its size in the waking world seemed light enough
to float up from between her breasts. There was light, of course,
seeming to come from everywhere and nowhere. It was not like
sunlight, or lamps, but even if it was night here, too, there was
always enough of that odd light to see. As in a dream. The
ever-present sensation of unseen eyes watching was not dreamlike&mdash;more like a nightmare&mdash;but she had grown accustomed to
that.</p>

<p>Great audiences were held in the Grand Hall, foreign
ambassadors formally received, important treaties and declarations
of war announced to gathered dignitaries, and the long chamber
suited its name and function. Empty of people save for her, it
seemed cavernous. Two rows of thick gleaming white columns, ten
spans high, marched the length of the room, and at one end, the
Lion Throne stood atop a marble dais, with red carpeting climbing
the white steps from the red-and-white floor tiles. The throne was
sized for a woman, but still massive on its heavy lion-pawed legs,
carved and gilded, with the White Lion picked out in moonstones on
a field of rubies at the top of its high back, announcing that
whoever sat there ruled a great nation. From large, colored windows
set in the arched ceiling high overhead, the queens who had founded
Andor stared down, their images alternating with the White Lion and
scenes of the battles they had fought to build Andor from a single
city in Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s shattering empire into that nation.
Many lands that had come out of the War of the Hundred Years no
longer existed, yet Andor had survived the thousand years since and
prospered. Sometimes Elayne felt those images judging her, weighing
her worth to follow in their footsteps.</p>

<p>No sooner did she find herself in the Grand Hall than
another woman appeared, sitting on the Lion Throne, a dark-haired
young woman in flowing red silk embroidered in silver lions on the
sleeves and hem, with a strand of firedrops as large as
pigeon&rsquo;s eggs around her neck and the Rose Crown sitting on
her head. One hand resting lightly on the lion-headed arm of the
throne, she gazed regally about the Hall. Then her eyes fell on
Elayne, and recognition dawned, along with confusion. Crown and
firedrops and silks vanished, replaced by plain woolens and a long
apron. An instant later, the young woman vanished, too.</p>

<p>Elayne smiled in amusement. Even scullions dreamed of
sitting on the Lion Throne. She hoped the young woman had not been
wakened in fright by the start she received, or at least that she
had gone on to another pleasant dream. A safer dream than <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>.</p>

<p>Other things shifted in the throne room. The
elaborately worked stand-lamps standing in rows down the chamber
seemed to vibrate against the tall columns. The great arched doors
stood now open, now closed, in the blink of an eye. Only things
that had stood in one place for a goodly time had a truly permanent
reflection in the World of Dreams.</p>

<p>Elayne imagined a stand-mirror, and it was before
her, reflecting her image in high-necked green silk worked in
silver across the bodice, with emeralds in her ears and smaller
ones strung in her red-gold curls. She made the emeralds disappear
from her hair, and nodded. Fit for the Daughter-Heir, but not too
ostentatious. You had to be careful of how you imagined yourself,
here, or else&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Her modest green silk gown became the snug,
form-hugging folds of a Taraboner gown, then flashed to dark, wide
Sea Folk trousers and bare feet, complete with golden earrings and
nose ring and chain full of medallions, and even dark tattoos on
her hands. But without a blouse, the way the Atha&rsquo;an Miere
went at sea. Cheeks coloring, she hastily returned everything to
how it had been, then changed the emerald earrings for plain silver
hoops. The simpler you imagined your garb, the easier it was to
maintain.</p>

<p>Letting the stand-mirror disappear&mdash;she just
had to stop concentrating on it&mdash;she looked up at those stern
faces overhead. &ldquo;Women have taken the throne as young as I,&rdquo; she
told them. Not very many, though; only seven who had managed to
wear the Rose Crown for very long. &ldquo;Women younger than I.&rdquo; Three.
And one of those lasted barely a year. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t claim I will
be as great as you, but I will not make you ashamed, either. I will
be a good queen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Talking to <em>windows</em>?&rdquo; Nynaeve said, making
Elayne start in surprise. Using a copy of the ring Elayne wore next
to her skin, she appeared misty, almost transparent. Frowning, she
tried to stride toward Elayne and staggered, nearly tripped by the
hobbling skirt of a deep blue Taraboner dress that was much tighter
than the one Elayne had imagined on herself. Nynaeve gaped down at
the thing, and abruptly it was an Andoran gown in the same colored
silk, embroidered in gold on the sleeves and atop the bodice. She
still went on about &ldquo;good, stout Two Rivers wool&rdquo; being good enough
for her, but even here where she could appear in it if she wished,
she almost never did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What <em>did</em> you put in that wine, Nynaeve?&rdquo;
Elayne asked. &ldquo;I went out like a snuffed candle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to change the subject. If you are
talking to windows, you should <em>really</em> be asleep instead of
here. I&rsquo;ve half a mind to order you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m not Vandene, Nynaeve.
Light, I don&rsquo;t even <em>know</em> half the customs Vandene and
the others take for granted. But I would rather not disobey you, so
don&rsquo;t, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve glowered at her, giving her braid one firm
tug. Details of her dress changed, the skirts growing a trifle
fuller, the embroidery&rsquo;s pattern altering, the high neck
sinking, then rising again, sprouting lace. She was just not very
good at the necessary concentration. The red dot on her forehead
never wavered, though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said calmly, the scowl vanishing.
Her yellow-fringed shawl appeared on her shoulders, and her face
took on something of the Aes Sedai agelessness. There were wings of
white at her temples. Her words contrasted with her appearance and
composed tone, though. &ldquo;Let me do the talking when Egwene gets
here. I mean about what happened today. You always end up
chattering as if you&rsquo;re brushing each other&rsquo;s hair for
bed. Light! I don&rsquo;t want her coming to the Amyrlin with <em>
me</em>, and you know she will be all over both of us if she finds
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I find out what?&rdquo; Egwene said. Nynaeve&rsquo;s
head whipped around, eyes panic-stricken, and for a moment her
fringed shawl and silk gown were replaced by an Accepted&rsquo;s
banded white. Even the <em>ki&rsquo;sain</em> went. Just a moment,
and she was back as she had been except for the white in her hair,
yet that was enough to put a rueful expression on Egwene&rsquo;s
face. She knew Nynaeve very well. &ldquo;If I find out what, Nynaeve?&rdquo;
she asked firmly.</p>

<p>Elayne drew a deep breath. She had not intended to
hold anything back, exactly. Not anything important to Egwene, any
way. But in her present mood, Nynaeve was likely to babble
everything, or else grow stubborn and try insisting there was
nothing to find out. Which would only make Egwene dig harder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Someone put forkroot in my midday tea,&rdquo; she said,
and went on succinctly about the men with their daggers and Doilin
Mellar&rsquo;s fortuitous appearance, and how Dyelin had proved
herself. For good measure she added the news of Elenia and Naean,
and the First Maid&rsquo;s search for spies in the Palace, and even
Zarya and Kirstian being assigned to Vandene, and the attack on
Rand and his disappearance. Egwene appeared to be unruffled by the
recital&mdash;she even cut Elayne short about Rand, saying she
already knew&mdash;but she gave a dismissive shake of her head at
hearing that Vandene had made no progress in learning who the Black
sister was, and that was of the gravest concern to her. &ldquo;Oh, and
I&rsquo;m to have a bodyguard,&rdquo; Elayne finished. &ldquo;Twenty women,
commanded by Captain Mellar. I don&rsquo;t think Birgitte will find
me any Maidens, but she will come close.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A backless armchair appeared behind Egwene, and she
sat without looking for it. She was much more skilled here than
Elayne or Nynaeve. She wore a dark green woolen riding dress, fine
and well-cut but unadorned, likely what she had worn awake that
day. And it remained a green woolen riding dress. &ldquo;I would tell you
to join me in Murandy tomorrow&mdash;tonight,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if the
arrival of the Kinswomen would not light a wildfire among the
Sitters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve had recovered herself, though she gave her
skirts an unneeded adjusting shake. The embroidery on her dress was
silver, now. &ldquo;I thought you had the Hall of the Tower under your
thumb, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very much like having a ferret under
your thumb,&rdquo; Egwene said dryly. &ldquo;It twists and writhes and wriggles
around to nip at your wrist. Oh, they do just as I say when it
concerns the war with Elaida&mdash;they can&rsquo;t get around
that, however much they grumble over the expense of more soldiers!&mdash;but the agreement with the Kin is no part of the war, or
letting the Kin learn the Tower had known about them all along. Or
thought it did. The entire Hall would have apoplexy, just at
finding out how much they didn&rsquo;t know. They are trying very
hard to find a way to stop accepting new novices.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t, can they?&rdquo; Nynaeve demanded. She
made a chair for herself, but it was a copy of Egwene&rsquo;s when
she looked to make sure it was there, a three-legged stool as she
began to sit, and a ladder-backed farm chair by the time she
settled on it. Her dress had divided skirts, now. &ldquo;You made a
proclamation. Any woman of any age, if she tested true. All you
have to do is make another, about the Kin.&rdquo; Elayne made her own
seat a copy of one of the chairs in her sitting room. Much easier
to hold onto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, an Amyrlin&rsquo;s proclamation is as good as
law,&rdquo; Egwene said. &ldquo;Until the Hall sees a way around it. The newest
complaint is that we only have sixteen Accepted. Though most
sisters do treat Faolain and Theodrin as if they were still
Accepted. But even eighteen isn&rsquo;t near sufficient to give the
novice lessons that Accepted are supposed to handle. Sisters have
to take them, instead. I think some were hoping the weather would
hold the numbers down, but it hasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; She smiled suddenly, a
light of mischief in her dark eyes. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one new novice
I&rsquo;d like you to meet, Nynaeve. Sharina Melloy. A grandmother.
I think you&rsquo;ll agree she&rsquo;s a remarkable woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s chair disappeared completely, and she
hit the floor with an audible smack. She hardly seemed to notice,
sitting there and staring at Egwene in astonishment. &ldquo;Sharina
Melloy?&rdquo; she said in a shaky voice. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a novice?&rdquo; Her
dress was a style Elayne had never seen before, with flowing
sleeves and a deeply scooped neck worked with flowers in embroidery
and seed pearls. Her hair flowed to her waist, held by a cap of
moonstones and sapphires on golden wires no thicker than threads.
And there was a plain golden band on her left forefinger. Only the
<em>ki&rsquo;sain</em> and her Great Serpent ring remained the
same.</p>

<p>Egwene blinked. &ldquo;You know the name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Getting to her feet, Nynaeve stared at her dress. She
held up her left hand and touched the plain gold ring almost
hesitantly. Strangely, she left everything as it was. &ldquo;It might not
be the same woman,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t be!&rdquo; Making
another chair like Egwene&rsquo;s, she frowned at it as if
commanding it to stay, but it still had a high back and carving by
the time she sat. &ldquo;There was a Sharina Melloy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;It was during
my test for Accepted,&rdquo; she said in a rush, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to
talk about that; it&rsquo;s the rule!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Egwene said, though the
look she gave Nynaeve was certainly as strange as Elayne knew her
own must be. Still, there was nothing to be done; when Nynaeve
wanted to be stubborn, she could teach mules.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since you brought up the Kin, Egwene,&rdquo; Elayne said,
&ldquo;have you thought further on the Oath Rod?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene raised one hand as if to stop her, but her
reply was calm and level. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to think further,
Elayne. The Three Oaths, sworn on the Oath Rod, are what make us
Aes Sedai. I didn&rsquo;t see that, at first, but I do, now. The
very first day we have the Tower, I will swear the Three Oaths, on
the Oath Rod.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s madness!&rdquo; Nynaeve burst out, leaning
forward in her chair. Surprisingly, still the same chair. And still
the same dress. Very surprising. Her hands were fists resting on
her lap. &ldquo;You know what it does; the Kin are proof! How many Aes
Sedai live past three hundred? Or reach it? And don&rsquo;t tell me
I shouldn&rsquo;t talk about age. That&rsquo;s a ridiculous custom,
and you know it. Egwene, Reanne was called Eldest because she was
the oldest Kinswoman in Ebou Dar. The oldest anywhere is a woman
called Aloisia Nemosni, an oil merchant in Tear. Egwene, she&rsquo;s
nearly six&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;hundred&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;years&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;old! When the Hall hears
that, I wager they&rsquo;ll be ready to put the Oath Rod on a
shelf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light knows three hundred years is a long time,&rdquo;
Elayne put in, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m happy myself at the
prospect of perhaps cutting my life in half, Egwene. And what of
the Oath Rod and your promise to the Kin? Reanne wants to be Aes
Sedai, but what happens when she swears? What about Aloisia? Will
she fall over dead? You can&rsquo;t ask them to swear, not
knowing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t <em>ask</em> anything.&rdquo; Egwene&rsquo;s
face was still smooth, but her back had straightened, her voice
cooled. And hardened. Her eyes augered deep. &ldquo;Any woman who wants
to be a sister <em>will</em> swear. And <em>anyone</em> who refuses
and still calls herself Aes Sedai <em>will</em> feel the full
weight of Tower justice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne swallowed hard under that steady gaze.
Nynaeve&rsquo;s face paled. There was no mistaking Egwene&rsquo;s
meaning. They were not hearing a friend now, but the Amyrlin Seat,
and the Amyrlin Seat had no friends when it came time to pronounce
judgment.</p>

<p>Apparently satisfied with what she saw in them,
Egwene relaxed. &ldquo;I do know the problem,&rdquo; she said in a more normal
tone. More normal, but still not inviting argument. &ldquo;I expect any
woman whose name is in the novice books to go as far as she can, to
earn the shawl if she can, and serve as Aes Sedai, but I don&rsquo;t
want anyone to die for it when they could live. Once the Hall
learns about the Kin&mdash;once they&rsquo;re over pitching fits&mdash;I think I can get them to agree that a sister who wants to
retire should be able to. With the Oaths removed.&rdquo; They had decided
long ago that the Rod could be used to unbind as well as bind, else
how could Black sisters lie?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose that would be all right,&rdquo; Nynaeve allowed
judiciously. Elayne simply nodded; she was certain there was
more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Retire into the Kin, Nynaeve,&rdquo; Egwene said gently.
&ldquo;That way, the Kin are bound to the Tower, too. The Kin will keep
their own ways, of course, their Rule, but they will have to agree
that their Knitting Circle is beneath the Amyrlin, if not the Hall,
and that Kinswomen stand below sisters. I do mean them to be part
of the Tower, not go their own way. But I think they will
accept.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve nodded again, happily, but her smile faded as
the full import reached her. She spluttered indignantly. &ldquo;But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;! Standing among the Kin is by age! You&rsquo;ll have sisters
taking orders from women who couldn&rsquo;t even reach
Accepted!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Former sisters, Nynaeve.&rdquo; Egwene fingered the Great
Serpent ring on her right hand and sighed faintly. &ldquo;Even Kinswomen
who earned the ring don&rsquo;t wear it. So we will have to give it
up, too. We will be Kinswomen, Nynaeve, not Aes Sedai any longer.&rdquo;
She sounded as if she could already feel that distant day, that
distant loss, but she took her hand from the ring and took a deep
breath. &ldquo;Now. Is there anything else? I have a long night ahead of
me, and I would like to get a little real sleep before I have to
face the Sitters again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frowning, Nynaeve had clenched her fist tight and
laid her other hand over it to cover her rings, but she appeared
ready to give up arguing over the Kin. For the time being. &ldquo;Do your
headaches still trouble you? I&rsquo;d think if that woman&rsquo;s
massages did any good, you&rsquo;d stop having them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Halima&rsquo;s massages work wonders, Nynaeve. I
couldn&rsquo;t sleep at all without her. Now, is there&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; She
trailed off, staring toward the doors at the entrance of the throne
room, and Elayne turned to look.</p>

<p>A man was standing there watching, a man as tall as
an Aielman, with dark red hair faintly streaked with white, but
his high-collared blue coat would never be worn by an Aiel. He
appeared muscular, and his hard face seemed somehow familiar. When
he saw them looking, he turned and ran down the corridor out of
sight.</p>

<p>For an instant, Elayne gaped. He had not just
accidentally dreamed himself into <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, or he would have vanished by now,
but she could still hear his boots, loud on the floor tiles. Either
he was a dreamwalker&mdash;rare among men, so the Wise Ones said&mdash;or he had a <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> of his own.</p>

<p>Leaping to her feet, she ran after him, but as fast
as she was, Egwene was faster. One instant Egwene was behind, the
next she was standing in the doorway, peering the way the man had
gone. Elayne tried thinking of herself standing beside Egwene, and
she was. The corridor was silent, now, and empty except for
stand-lamps and chests and tapestries, all flickering and
shifting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you do that?&rdquo; Nynaeve demanded, running up
with her skirts hoisted above her knees. Her stockings were silk,
and red! Hastily letting her skirts fall when she realized Elayne
had noticed her stockings, she peered down the hallway. &ldquo;Where did
he go? He could have heard everything! Did you recognize him? He
reminded me of someone; I don&rsquo;t know who.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand,&rdquo; Egwene said. &ldquo;He could have been Rand&rsquo;s
uncle.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Of course</em>, Elayne thought. <em>If Rand had a
mean uncle</em>.</p>

<p>A metallic click echoed from the far end of the
throne room. The door into the dressing rooms behind the dais,
closing. Doors were open or closed or sometimes in between in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>; they did not swing shut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light!&rdquo; Nynaeve muttered. &ldquo;How many people have been
eavesdropping on us? Not to mention who, and why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoever they are,&rdquo; Egwene replied calmly, &ldquo;they
apparently don&rsquo;t know <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> as
well as we do. Not friends, safe to say, or they wouldn&rsquo;t be
eavesdropping. And I think they may not be friends to one another,
otherwise, why listen from opposite ends of the room? That man was
wearing a Shienaran coat. There are Shienarans in my army, but you
both know them all. None resemble Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve sniffed. &ldquo;Well, whoever he is, there are too
many people listening at corners. That&rsquo;s what I think. I want
to be back in my own body, where all I have to worry about are
spies and poisoned daggers.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Shienarans</em>, Elayne thought. Borderlanders.
How could that have slipped her mind? Well, there had been the
little matter of forkroot. &ldquo;There is one more thing,&rdquo; she said
aloud, though in a careful voice she hoped would not carry, and
related Dyelin&rsquo;s news of Borderlanders in Braem Wood. She
added Master Norry&rsquo;s correspondence, too, all the while trying
to watch both ways along the corridor and the throne room as well.
She did not want to be caught napping by another spy. &ldquo;I think
those rulers are in Braem Wood,&rdquo; she finished, &ldquo;all four of
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand,&rdquo; Egwene breathed, sounding irritated. &ldquo;Even
when he can&rsquo;t be found he complicates things. Do you have any
idea whether they came to offer him allegiance or try to hand him
over to Elaida? I can&rsquo;t think of any other reasons for them to
march a thousand leagues. They must be boiling shoes for soup by
now! Do you have any idea how hard it is to keep an army supplied
on the march?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I can find out,&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;Why, I mean.
And at the same time&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;You gave me the idea, Egwene.&rdquo; She could
not help smiling. Something good <em>had</em> come of today. &ldquo;I
think I might just be able to use them to secure the Lion
Throne.&rdquo;</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Asne examined the tall embroidery frame in front of
her and gave a sigh that turned into a yawn. The flickering lamps
gave a poor light for this, but that was not the reason her birds
all seemed lopsided. She wanted to be in her bed, and she despised
embroidery. But she had to be awake, and this was the only way to
avoid conversation with Chesmal. What Chesmal called conversation.
The smugly arrogant Yellow was intent on her own embroidery, on the
other side of the room, and she assumed that anyone who took up a
needle had her own keen interest in the work. On the other hand,
Asne knew, if she rose from her chair, Chesmal would soon start
regaling her with tales of her own importance. In the months since
Moghedien vanished, she had heard Chesmal&rsquo;s part in putting
Tamra Ospenya to the question at least twenty times, and how
Chesmal had induced the Reds to murder Sierin Vayu before Sierin
could order her arrest perhaps fifty! To hear Chesmal tell it, she
had saved the Black Ajah single-handed, and she <em>would</em> tell
it, given half a chance. That sort of talk was not only boring, it
was dangerous. Even deadly, if the Supreme Council learned of it.
So Asne stifled another yawn, squinted at her work, and pushed the
needle through the tightly stretched linen. Perhaps if she made the
redbird larger, she could even up the wings.</p>

<p>The click of the doorlatch brought both women&rsquo;s
heads up. The two servants knew not to bother them, and in any
case, the woman and her husband should be fast asleep. Asne
embraced <em>saidar</em>, readying a weave that would sear an
intruder to the bone, and the glow surrounded Chesmal, too. If the
wrong person stepped through that door, they would regret it until
they died.</p>

<p>It was Eldrith, gloves in hand, with her dark cloak
still hanging down her back. The plump Brown&rsquo;s dress was dark,
too, and unadorned. Asne hated wearing plain woolens, but they did
need to avoid notice. The drab clothes suited Eldrith.</p>

<p>She stopped at the sight of them, blinking, a
momentary look of confusion on her round face. &ldquo;Oh, my,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Who did you think I was?&rdquo; Throwing her gloves onto the small table
by the door, she suddenly became aware of her cloak and frowned as
if just realizing she had worn it upstairs. Carefully unpinning the
silver brooch at her neck, she tossed the cloak onto a chair in a
tumbled heap.</p>

<p>The light of <em>saidar</em> winked out around
Chesmal as she twisted her embroidery frame aside so she could
stand. Her stern face made her seem taller than she was, and she
was a tall woman. The brightly colored flowers she had embroidered
might have been in a garden. &ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo; she demanded.
Eldrith stood highest among them, and Moghedien had left her in
charge besides, but Chesmal had begun taking only cursory notice if
that. &ldquo;You were supposed to be back by afternoon, and the night is
half gone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I lost track of the hour, Chesmal,&rdquo; Eldrith replied
absently, appearing lost in thought. &ldquo;It has been a long time since
I was last in Caemlyn. The Inner City is fascinating, and I had a
delightful meal at an inn I remembered. Though I must say, there
were fewer sisters about then. No one recognized me, however.&rdquo; She
peered at her brooch as though wondering where it had come from,
then tucked it into her belt pouch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You lost track,&rdquo; Chesmal said flatly, lacing her
fingers together at her waist. Perhaps to keep them from
Eldrith&rsquo;s throat. Her eyes glittered with anger. &ldquo;You lost
track.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once more Eldrith blinked, as if startled to be
addressed. &ldquo;Oh. Were you afraid Kennit had found me again? I assure
you, since Samara I have been quite careful at keeping the bond
masked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At times, Asne wondered how much of Eldrith&rsquo;s
apparent vagueness was real. No one so unaware of the world around
her could have survived this long. On the other hand, she had been
unfocused enough to let the masking slip more than once before they
reached Samara, enough for her Warder to track her. Obedient to
Moghedien&rsquo;s orders to await her return, they had hidden
through the riots after her departure, waited while the so-called
Prophet&rsquo;s mobs swept south into Amadicia, stayed in that
wretched, ruined town even after Asne became convinced that
Moghedien had abandoned them. Her lip curled at the memory. What
had sparked the decision to leave was the arrival of Eldrith&rsquo;s
Kennit in the town, sure that she was a murderer, half convinced
she was Black Ajah, and determined to kill her no matter the
consequences to himself. Not surprisingly, she had been unwilling
to face those consequences herself, and refused to let anyone kill
the man. The only alternative was to flee. Then again, Eldrith was
the one who had pointed out Caemlyn as their only hope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you learn anything, Eldrith?&rdquo; Asne asked
politely. Chesmal was a fool. However tattered the world seemed at
the moment, affairs would right themselves. One way or another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? Oh. Only that the pepper sauce wasn&rsquo;t as
good as I remembered. Of course, that was fifty years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Asne suppressed a sigh. Perhaps after all it was time
for Eldrith to have an accident.</p>

<p>The door opened and Temaile slipped into the room so
silently they were all caught by surprise. The diminutive fox-faced
Gray had tossed a robe embroidered with lions over her shoulders,
but it gaped down the front, exposing a cream-colored silk
nightdress that molded itself to her indecently. Draped over one
hand she carried a bracelet made of twisted glass rings. They
looked and felt like glass, at least, but a hammer could not have
chipped one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been to <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>,&rdquo; Eldrith said, frowning at the <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. She did not speak forcefully, though. They
were all a little afraid of Temaile since Moghedien had made them
observe the last of Liandrin being broken. Asne had lost track of
how often she had killed or tortured in the hundred and thirty-odd
years since she gained the shawl, but she had seldom seen anyone so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;enthusiastic&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;as Temaile. Watching Temaile and trying to
pretend not to, Chesmal seemed unaware that she was licking her
lips nervously. Asne hurriedly put her own tongue back behind her
teeth and hoped no one had noticed. Eldrith certainly had not. &ldquo;We
agreed not to use those,&rdquo; she said, not very far short of pleading.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m certain it was Nynaeve who wounded Moghedien, and if she
can best one of the Chosen in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>,
what chance do we have?&rdquo; Rounding on the others, she attempted a
scolding tone. &ldquo;Did you two know about this?&rdquo; She had managed to
sound peevish.</p>

<p>Chesmal met Eldrith&rsquo;s stare indignantly, while
Asne gave her surprised innocence. They had known, but who was
going to stand in Temaile&rsquo;s way? She doubted very much that
Eldrith would have made more than a token protest had she been
there.</p>

<p>Temaile knew exactly her effect on them. She should
have hung her head at Eldrith&rsquo;s lecture, fainthearted as it
was, and apologized for going against her wishes. Instead, she
smiled. That smile never reached her eyes, though, large and dark
and much too bright. &ldquo;You were right, Eldrith. Right that Elayne
would come here, and right that Nynaeve would come with her, it
seems. They were together, and it is clear they are both in the
Palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Eldrith said, squirming slightly under
Temaile&rsquo;s gaze. &ldquo;Well.&rdquo; And she licked <em>her</em> lips, and
shifted her feet, too. &ldquo;Even so, until we can see how to get at
them past all those wilders&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They <em>are</em> wilders, Eldrith.&rdquo; Temaile threw
herself down in a chair, limbs sprawling carelessly, and her tone
hardened. Not enough to seem commanding, but still more than merely
firm. &ldquo;There are only three sisters to trouble us, and we can
dispose of them. We can take Nynaeve, and perhaps Elayne in the
bargain.&rdquo; Abruptly she leaned forward, hands on the arms of the
chair. Disarrayed clothing or not, there was no shred of indolence
about her now. Eldrith stepped back as though pushed by
Temaile&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Else why are we here, Eldrith? It is what we
came for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one had anything to say to that. Behind them lay a
string of failures&mdash;in Tear, in Tanchico&mdash;that might
well cost them their lives when the Supreme Council laid hands on
them. But not if they had one of the Chosen for a patron, and if
Moghedien had wanted Nynaeve so badly, perhaps another of them
would, too. The real difficulty would be finding one of the Chosen
to present with their gift. No one but Asne seemed to have
considered that part of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There were others there,&rdquo; Temaile went on, leaning
back once more. She sounded almost bored. &ldquo;Spying on our two
Accepted. A man who let them see him, and someone else I could not
see.&rdquo; She pouted irritably. At least, it would have been a pout
except for her eyes. &ldquo;I had to stay behind a column so the girls
would not see me. That should please you, Eldrith. That they did
not see me. Are you pleased?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eldrith almost stammered getting out how pleased she
was.</p>

<p>Asne let herself feel her four Warders, coming ever
closer. She had stopped masking herself when they left Samara. Only
Powl was a Friend of the Dark, of course, yet the others would do
whatever she said, believe whatever she told them. It would be
necessary to keep them concealed from the others unless absolutely
necessary, but she wanted armed men close at hand. Muscles and
steel were very useful. And if worse came to worst, she could
always reveal the long, fluted rod that Moghedien had not hidden so
well as she thought she had.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The early-morning light in the sitting room&rsquo;s
windows was gray, an earlier hour than the Lady Shiaine usually
rose, but this morning she had been dressed while it was still full
dark. The Lady Shiaine was how she thought of herself, now. Mili
Skane, the saddler&rsquo;s daughter, was almost completely
forgotten. In every way that mattered, she really was the Lady
Shiaine Avarhin, and had been for years. Lord Willim Avarhin had
been impoverished, reduced to living in a ramshackle farmhouse and
unable to keep even that in good repair. He and his only daughter,
the last of a declining line, had stayed in the country, far from
anywhere their penury might be exposed, and now they were only
bones buried in the forest near that farmhouse, and <em>she</em>
was the Lady Shiaine, and if this tall, well-appointed stone house
was not a manor, it still had been the property of a well-to-do
merchant. She was long dead, too, after signing over her gold to
her &ldquo;heir.&rdquo; The furnishings were well made, the carpets costly, the
tapestries and even the seat cushions embroidered with
thread-of-gold, and the fire roared in a wide blue-veined marble
fireplace. She had had the once-plain lintel carved with
Avarhin&rsquo;s Heart and Hand row on row.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More wine, girl,&rdquo; she said curtly, and Falion
scurried with the tall-necked silver pitcher to refill her goblet
with steaming spiced wine. The livery of a maid, with the Red Heart
and Golden Hand on her breast, suited Falion. Her long face was a
stiff mask as she hurried to replace the pitcher on the drawered
highchest and take up her place beside the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You play a dangerous game,&rdquo; Marillin Gemalphin said,
rolling her own goblet between her palms. A skinny woman with
lifeless pale brown hair, the Brown sister did not look an Aes
Sedai. Her narrow face and wide nose would have fitted better above
Falion&rsquo;s livery than it did above her fine blue wool, and that
was suitable only for a middling merchant. &ldquo;She is shielded
somehow, I know, but when she can channel again, she will make you
howl for this.&rdquo; Her thin lips quirked in a humorless smile. &ldquo;You
may find yourself wishing you could howl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moridin chose this for her,&rdquo; Shiaine replied. &ldquo;She
failed in Ebou Dar, and he ordered her punished. I don&rsquo;t know
the details and don&rsquo;t want to, but if Moridin wants her nose
ground in the mud, I&rsquo;ll push it so deep she is breathing mud a
year from now. Or do you suggest I disobey one of the Chosen?&rdquo; She
barely suppressed a shudder at the very thought. Marillin tried to
hide her expression in drinking, but her eyes tightened. &ldquo;What
about you, Falion?&rdquo; Shiaine asked. &ldquo;Would you like me to ask
Moridin to take you away? He might find you something less
onerous.&rdquo; Mules might sing like nightingales, too.</p>

<p>Falion did not even hesitate. She bobbed a
maid&rsquo;s straight-backed curtsy, her face going even paler than
it already was. &ldquo;No, mistress,&rdquo; she said hastily. &ldquo;I am content
with my situation, mistress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see?&rdquo; Shiaine said to the other Aes Sedai. She
doubted very much that Falion was anything approaching content, but
the woman would accept whatever was handed out rather than face
Moridin&rsquo;s displeasure directly. For the same reason, Shiaine
would rule her with a very heavy hand. You never knew what one of
the Chosen might learn of, and take amiss. She herself thought her
own failure was buried deep, but she would take no chances. &ldquo;When
she can channel again, she won&rsquo;t have to be a maid all the
time, Marillin.&rdquo; Anyway, Moridin had said Shiaine could kill her if
she wished. There was always that, if her position began to chafe
too much. He had said she could kill both sisters, if she
wished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as may be,&rdquo; Marillin said darkly. She
cast a sidelong glance at Falion and grimaced. &ldquo;Now, Moghedien
instructed me to offer you what assistance I thought I could give,
but I&rsquo;ll tell you right now, I won&rsquo;t enter the Royal
Palace. The whole city has too many sisters in it for my taste, but
the Palace is stuffed with wilders on top. I wouldn&rsquo;t get ten
feet without someone knowing I was there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sighing, Shiaine leaned back and crossed her legs,
idly kicking a slippered foot. Why did people always think you did
not know as much as they? The world was full of fools! &ldquo;Moghedien
ordered you to obey me, Marillin. I know, because Moridin told me.
He did not say so right out, but I think when he snaps his fingers,
Moghedien jumps.&rdquo; Talking about the Chosen this way was dangerous,
but she had to make matters clear. &ldquo;Do you want to tell me again
what you won&rsquo;t do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The narrow-faced Aes Sedai licked her lips, darting
another glance at Falion. Did the woman fear <em>she</em> would end
up that way? Truth to tell, Shiaine would have traded Falion for a
proper lady&rsquo;s maid in a heartbeat. Well, as long as she could
retain her other services. Very likely, they both would have to die
when this was finished. Shiaine did not like leaving loose
ends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t lying about that,&rdquo; Marillin said
slowly. &ldquo;I really wouldn&rsquo;t get ten feet. But there&rsquo;s a
woman already in the Palace. She can do what you need. It may take
time to make contact, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just make sure it&rsquo;s not too long a time,
Marillin.&rdquo; So. One of the sisters in the Palace was Black Ajah, was
she? She would have to be Aes Sedai, not just a Darkfriend, to do
what Shiaine needed.</p>

<p>The door opened, and Murellin looked in
questioningly, his heavily muscled bulk almost filling the doorway.
Beyond him, she could make out another man. At her nod, Murellin
stepped aside and motioned Daved Hanlon to enter, closing the door
behind him. Hanlon was swathed in a dark cloak, but he snaked out
one hand to cup Falion&rsquo;s bottom through her dress. She glared
at him bitterly, but did not move away. Hanlon was part of her
punishment. Still, Shiaine had no wish to watch him fondle the
woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do that later,&rdquo; she ordered. &ldquo;Did it go well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A broad smile split his axe-like face. &ldquo;It went
exactly as I planned it, of course.&rdquo; He threw one side of the dark
cloak over his shoulder, revealing golden knots of rank on his red
coat. &ldquo;You are speaking to the Captain of the Queen&rsquo;s
Bodyguard.&rdquo;</p>
