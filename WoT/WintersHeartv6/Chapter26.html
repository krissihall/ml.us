<h4><em>Expectation</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">W</span>alking
across the brown-grassed village green of
Emond&rsquo;s Field with Egwene, Elayne felt saddened by the
changes. Egwene seemed stunned by them. When she first appeared in
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, a long braid had dangled down
Egwene&rsquo;s back and she was in a plain woolen dress, of all
things, with stout shoes peeking out beneath her skirts as she
walked. Elayne supposed it was the sort of clothing she had worn
when she lived in the Two Rivers. Now her dark hair hung about her
shoulders, secured by a small cap of fine lace, and her garments
were as fine as Elayne&rsquo;s, a rich blue embroidered with silver
on the bodice and high neck as well as along the hem of her skirt
and her cuffs. Silver-worked velvet slippers replaced the thick
leather shoes. Elayne needed to maintain her focus to keep her own
green silk riding dress from altering, perhaps in embarrassing
fashion, but for her friend, without any doubt, the changes were
deliberate.</p>

<p>She hoped Rand could still love Emond&rsquo;s Field,
but it was no longer the village where he and Egwene had grown up.
There were no people, here in the World of Dreams, yet clearly
Emond&rsquo;s Field was a considerable town now, a prosperous town,
with nearly one house in three made of well-dressed stone, some of
three stories, and more roofed with tiles in every hue of the
rainbow than with thatch. Some streets were paved with smooth
well-fitted stone, new and unworn as yet, and there was even a
thick stone wall going up around the town, with towers and
iron-plated gates that would have suited a Borderland town. Outside
the walls there were gristmills and sawmills, an iron foundry and
large workshops for weavers of both woolens and carpets, and within
were shops run by furniture makers, potters, seamstresses, cutlers,
and gold- and silversmiths, many as fine as could be seen in
Caemlyn, though some of the styles seemed to be from Arad Doman or
Tarabon.</p>

<p>The air was cool but not cold, and there was not a
sign of snow on the ground, at least for the moment. The sun stood
straight overhead here, though Elayne hoped it was still night in
the waking world. She wanted some real sleep before she had to face
the morning. She was always tired, the last few days; there was
just so much to be done, and so few hours. They had come here
because it seemed unlikely any spy could find them here, but Egwene
had lingered to stare at the changes in the place she was born. And
Elayne had her own reasons, beyond Rand, for wanting to look over
Emond&rsquo;s Field. The problem, one of the problems, was that one
hour might pass in the waking world while you spent five or ten in
the World of Dreams, but it could just as easily be the other way
around. It might be morning already in Caemlyn.</p>

<p>Stopping at the edge of the green, Egwene gazed back
at the wide stone bridge that arched over the rapidly widening
stream running from a spring that gushed out of a stone outcrop
strongly enough to knock a man down. A massive marble shaft carved
all over with names stood in the middle of the green, and two tall
flagpoles on stone bases. &ldquo;A battle monument,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Who
could imagine such a thing in Emond&rsquo;s Field? Though Moiraine
said that once a great battle was fought on this spot, in the
Trolloc Wars, when Manetheren died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was in the history I studied,&rdquo; Elayne said
quietly, glancing at the bare flagpoles. Bare for the moment. She
could not feel Rand, here. Oh, he was still in her head as much as
Birgitte, a rocklike knot of emotions and physical sensations that
was even more difficult to interpret now that he was far away, yet
here in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, she could not know which
direction he was. She missed that knowledge, small as it was. She
missed him.</p>

<p>Banners appeared atop the flagpoles, remaining just
long enough to ripple once lazily. Long enough to make out on one a
red eagle flying across a field of blue. Not <em>a</em> red eagle;
the Red Eagle. Once, visiting this place with Nynaeve in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, she had thought she glimpsed it, had
decided she must be mistaken. Master Norry had begun setting her
straight. She loved Rand, but if someone in the place he grew up
was trying to raise Manetheren from its ancient grave, she would
have to take cognizance, however much it pained him. That banner
and that name still carried enough power to threaten Andor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard about changes from Bode Cauthon and the
other novices from home,&rdquo; Egwene went on, frowning at the houses
around the green, &ldquo;but nothing like this.&rdquo; Most of those houses
were stone. A tiny inn still stood beside the sprawling stone
foundation of some much larger building, with a huge oak growing up
through the middle of it, but what looked to be an inn many times
bigger was almost finished on the other side of the foundation,
with a large sign reading <span class="smallcaps">the archers</span> already hung above
the door. &ldquo;I wonder whether my father is still Mayor. Is my mother
well? My sisters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you are moving the army tomorrow,&rdquo; Elayne
said, &ldquo;if it isn&rsquo;t tomorrow already, but surely you could find
a few hours to visit here once you reach Tar Valon.&rdquo; Traveling made
such things easy. Perhaps she herself should send someone to
Emond&rsquo;s Field. If she knew whom to trust for the mission. If
she could spare anyone she did trust.</p>

<p>Egwene shook her head. &ldquo;Elayne, I&rsquo;ve had to
order women I grew up with switched because they don&rsquo;t believe
I am the Amyrlin Seat, or if they do, that they can break the rules
because they knew me.&rdquo; Suddenly the seven-striped stole hung from
her shoulders. Until she noticed it with a grimace, and it vanished
again. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can face confronting Emond&rsquo;s
Field as Amyrlin,&rdquo; she said sadly. &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo; She gave herself a
shake, and her voice firmed. &ldquo;The Wheel turns, Elayne, and
everything changes. I must get used to it. I <em>will</em> get used
to it.&rdquo; She sounded a great deal like Siuan Sanche, as Siuan had
sounded in Tar Valon before everything had changed. Stole or no
stole, Egwene sounded like the Amyrlin Seat. &ldquo;Are you certain I
can&rsquo;t send you some of Gareth Bryne&rsquo;s soldiers? Enough to
help secure Caemlyn, at least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly, they were surrounded by glistening snow,
standing knee-deep in it. Snow made gleaming white mounds on the
rooftops as if from a heavy fall. This was not the first time such
a thing had happened, and they simply refused to let the sudden
cold touch them, rather than imagining cloaks and warmer
clothes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one is going to move against me before spring,&rdquo;
Elayne said. Armies did not move in winter, at least, not unless
they had the benefit of Traveling, like Egwene&rsquo;s army. Snow
bogged everything down, and mud whenever the snow melted. Those
Borderlanders probably had begun their march south thinking winter
was never coming this year. &ldquo;Besides, you will need every man when
you reach Tar Valon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, Egwene nodded acceptance without
making the offer again. Even with this past month of hard
recruiting behind her, Gareth Bryne still had no more than half the
soldiers he had told her would be needed to take Tar Valon.
According to Egwene, he was ready to begin with what he had, but
clearly it troubled her. &ldquo;I have hard decisions to make, Elayne.
The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills, but it is still me who has to
decide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Impulsively, Elayne waded through the snow and threw
her arms around Egwene to hug her. At least, she started out
wading. As she clasped the other woman to her, the snow vanished,
leaving not so much as a damp spot on their dresses. The two of
them staggered as if dancing with one another and almost fell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you will make the right decision,&rdquo; Elayne
said, laughing in spite of herself. Egwene did not join her
laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; she said gravely, &ldquo;because whatever I
decide, people are going to die for it.&rdquo; She patted Elayne&rsquo;s
arm. &ldquo;Well, you understand that sort of decision, don&rsquo;t you.
We both need to be back in our beds.&rdquo; She hesitated before going
on. &ldquo;Elayne, if Rand comes to you again, you must let me know what
he says, whether he gives you any clue what he means to do or where
he means to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell you whatever I can, Egwene.&rdquo; Elayne felt
a stab of guilt. She had told Egwene everything&mdash;almost
everything&mdash;but not that she had bonded Rand with Min and
Aviendha. Tower law did not prohibit what they had done. Very
careful questioning of Vandene had made that much clear. But
whether it would be permitted was not clear at all. Still, as she
had heard an Arafellin mercenary recruited by Birgitte say, &ldquo;what
was not forbidden was allowed.&rdquo; That sounded almost like one of
Lini&rsquo;s old sayings, though she doubted her nurse would ever
have been so permissive. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re troubled by him, Egwene. More
than usual, I mean. I can tell. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have reason to be, Elayne. The eyes-and-ears
report very troubling rumors. Only rumors, I hope, but if they
aren&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She was very much the Amyrlin Seat now, a short
slender young woman who seemed strong as steel and tall as a
mountain. Determination filled her dark eyes and set her jaw. &ldquo;I
know you love him. I love him, too. But I am not trying to Heal the
White Tower just so he can chain Aes Sedai like <em>damane</em>.
Sleep well and have pleasant dreams, Elayne. Pleasant dreams are
more valuable than people realize.&rdquo; And with that, she was gone,
back to the waking world.</p>

<p>For a moment, Elayne stood staring at the spot where
Egwene had been. What had she been talking about? Rand would never
do that! If only for love of her, he would not! She prodded that
rock-hard knot in the back of her head. With him so far away, the
veins of gold shone only in memory. Surely he would not. Troubled
in herself, she stepped out of the dream, back to her sleeping
body.</p>

<p>She needed sleep, but no sooner was she back in her
own body than sunlight fell on her eyelids. What hour was it? She
had appointments to keep, duties to carry out. She wanted to sleep
for months. She wrestled with duty, but duty won. She had a busy
day ahead. Every day was a busy day. Her eyes popped open, feeling
grainy, as if she had not slept at all. By the slant of light
through the windows, it was well beyond sunrise. She could simply
lie there. Duty. Aviendha shifted in her sleep, and Elayne poked
her sharply in the ribs. If she had to be awake, then Aviendha was
not going to loll about.</p>

<p>Aviendha woke with a start, stretching for her knife
lying atop the small table on her side of the bed. Before her hand
touched the dark horn hilt, she let it fall. &ldquo;Something woke me,&rdquo;
she muttered. &ldquo;I thought a Shaido was&mdash;Look at the sun! Why
did you let me sleep so late?&rdquo; she demanded, scrambling from the
bed. &ldquo;Just because I&rsquo;m allowed to stay with you&mdash;&rdquo; the
words were muffled for an instant as she jerked her sleep-wrinkled
shift off over her head &ldquo;&mdash;does not mean Monaelle won&rsquo;t
switch me if she thinks I am being lazy. Do you mean to lie there
all day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a groan, Elayne climbed out of the bed. Essande
was already waiting at the door to the dressing room; she never
waked Elayne unless Elayne remembered to order it. Elayne
surrendered herself to the white-haired woman&rsquo;s almost silent
ministrations while Aviendha dressed herself, but her sister made
up for Essande&rsquo;s quiet with a laughing string of comments
along the line of how having someone else put your clothes on you
must feel like being a baby again and how Elayne might forget how
to put on her own clothes and need somebody to dress her. She had
done very much the same every morning since they had begun to share
the same bed. Aviendha found it very funny. Elayne did not say a
word, except to answer her tirewoman&rsquo;s suggestions on what she
should wear, until the last mother-of-pearl button was done up and
she stood examining herself in the stand-mirror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Essande,&rdquo; she said then, casually, &ldquo;are
Aviendha&rsquo;s clothes ready?&rdquo; The fine blue wool with a little
silver embroidery would do well enough for what she faced
today.</p>

<p>Essande brightened. &ldquo;All Lady Aviendha&rsquo;s pretty
silks and laces, my Lady? Oh, yes. All brushed and cleaned and
ironed and put away.&rdquo; She gestured to the wardrobes lining one
wall.</p>

<p>Elayne smiled over her shoulder at her sister.
Aviendha stared at the wardrobes as though they contained vipers,
then gulped and hastily finished winding the dark folded kerchief
around her head.</p>

<p>When Elayne had dismissed Essande, she said, &ldquo;Just in
case you need them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Aviendha muttered, putting on her silver
necklace. &ldquo;No more jokes about the woman dressing you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good. Or I&rsquo;ll tell her to start dressing <em>
you</em>. Now, that <em>would</em> be amusing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grumbling under her breath about people who could not
take a joke, Aviendha plainly did not agree. Elayne half expected
her to demand that all the clothes she had acquired be discarded.
She was a little surprised Aviendha had not seen to it already.</p>

<p>For Aviendha, the breakfast laid out in the sitting
room consisted of cured ham with raisins, eggs cooked with dried
plums, dried fish prepared with pine nuts, fresh bread slathered
with butter, and tea made syrupy with honey. Well, not actually
syrupy, but it seemed so. Elayne got no butter on her bread, very
little honey in her tea, and instead of the rest, a hot porridge of
grains and herbs that was supposed to be especially healthy. She
did not feel with child, no matter what Min had told Aviendha, but
Min had told Birgitte, too, once the three of them began getting
drunk. Between her Warder, Dyelin, and Reene Harfor, she now found
herself limited to a diet &ldquo;suitable for a woman in her condition.&rdquo;
If she sent to the kitchens for a treat, somehow it never arrived,
and if she slipped down there herself, the cooks gave her such glum
disapproving stares that she slipped back out again with
nothing.</p>

<p>She did not really mourn the spiced wine and sweets
and the other things she was no longer allowed&mdash;not that
much, anyway, except when Aviendha was gobbling tarts or puddings&mdash;but <em>everyone</em> in the Palace knew she was pregnant.
And of course, that meant they knew how she had gotten that way, if
not with whom. The men were not too bad, beyond the fact that they
knew, and she knew they knew, but the women did not bother to hide
knowing. Whether they accepted or deprecated the situation, half
looked at her as though she were a hoyden and the other half with
speculation. Forcing herself to swallow the porridge&mdash;it was
not that bad, really, but she dearly would have loved some of the
ham Aviendha was slicing, or a little of the egg with plums&mdash;spooning lumpy porridge into her mouth, she almost looked forward
to the start of birthing sickness, so she could share the queasy
belly with Birgitte.</p>

<p>The first visitor to enter her apartments that
morning beside Essande was the leading candidate among the Palace
women for the father of her barely quickened child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Queen,&rdquo; Captain Mellar said, sweeping off his
plumed hat in a flourishing bow. &ldquo;The Chief Clerk awaits Your
Majesty&rsquo;s pleasure.&rdquo; The captain&rsquo;s dark, unblinking eyes
said he would never have dreams of the men he killed, and the
lace-edged sash across his chest and the lace at his neck and
wrists only made him look harder. Wiping grease from her chin with
a linen napkin, Aviendha watched him with no expression on her
face. The two Guardswomen standing one on either side of the doors
grimaced faintly. Mellar already had a reputation for pinching
Guardswomen&rsquo;s bottoms, the prettier ones&rsquo; at least, not
to mention disparaging their abilities in the city&rsquo;s taverns.
The second was far worse, in the Guardswomen&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not a queen, yet, Captain,&rdquo; Elayne said
briskly. She always tried to keep as much to the point as possible
with the man. &ldquo;How is recruiting for my bodyguard coming
along?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only thirty-two, so far, my Lady.&rdquo; Still holding his
hat, the hatchet-faced man rested both hands on his sword hilt, his
lounging posture hardly suitable for the presence of one he had
called his queen. Nor was his grin. &ldquo;Lady Birgitte has exacting
standards. Not many women can match them. Give me ten days, and I
can find a hundred men who&rsquo;ll better them and hold you as dear
in their hearts as I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not, Captain Mellar.&rdquo; It was an effort to
keep a chill out of her voice. He had to have heard the rumors
concerning himself and her. Could he think that just because she
had not denied them, she might actually find him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;attractive?
Pushing away the half-empty porridge bowl, she suppressed a
shudder. Thirty-two, so far? The numbers were growing quickly. Some
of the Hunters for the Horn who had been demanding rank had decided
that serving in Elayne&rsquo;s bodyguard carried a certain flair.
She conceded that the women could not all be on duty day and night,
but no matter what Birgitte said, the goal of a hundred seemed
excessive. The woman dug in her heels now at any suggestion of
fewer, though. &ldquo;Please tell the Chief Clerk he can come in,&rdquo; she
told him. He swept her another elaborate bow.</p>

<p>She rose to follow him, and as he pulled one of the
lion-carved doors open, she laid a hand on his arm and smiled.
&ldquo;Thank you again for saving my life, Captain,&rdquo; she said, this time
warm enough for a caress.</p>

<p>The fellow smirked at her! The Guardswomen stared
straight ahead, frozen, those she could see out in the hall before
the doors closed behind him as well as those inside, and when
Elayne turned around, Aviendha was staring at her with little more
expression than she had shown Mellar. That little was pure
amazement, though. Elayne sighed.</p>

<p>Crossing the carpets, she bent to put an arm around
her sister and spoke softly, for her ear alone. She trusted the
women of her bodyguard with things she told very few others, but
there were some matters she dared not trust to them. &ldquo;I saw a maid
passing, Aviendha. Maids gossip worse than men. The more who think
this child is Doilin Mellar&rsquo;s, the safer it will be. If
necessary, I&rsquo;ll let the man pinch my bottom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Aviendha said slowly, and frowned into her
plate as though seeing something other than the eggs and plums she
began pushing around with her spoon.</p>

<p>Master Norry presented his usual blend of mundane
maintenance of the Palace and the city, tidbits from his
correspondents in foreign capitals, and information gleaned from
merchants and bankers and others who had dealings beyond the
borders, but his first piece of news was by far the most important
to her, if not the most interesting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The two most prominent bankers in the city are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;amenable, my Lady,&rdquo; he said in that dry-as-dust voice of his.
Clutching his leather folder to his narrow chest, he eyed Aviendha
sideways. He was still not accustomed to her presence while he made
his reports. Or the Guardswomen. Aviendha bared her teeth at him,
and he blinked, then coughed into a bony hand. &ldquo;Master Hoffley and
Mistress Andscale were somewhat&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;hesitant&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;at first, but
they know the market for alum as well as I. It would not be safe to
say that their coffers are now yours, but I have arranged for
twenty thousand gold crowns to be moved to the Palace strongroom,
and more will come as needed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Inform the Lady Birgitte,&rdquo; Elayne told him, hiding
her relief. Birgitte had not yet signed enough new Guards to hold a
city as large as Caemlyn, much less do anything else, but Elayne
could not expect to see revenue from her estates before spring, and
the mercenaries <em>were</em> expensive. Now she would not lose
them for lack of gold before Birgitte recruited men to replace
them. &ldquo;Next, Master Norry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear the sewers must be given a high priority, my
Lady. The rats are breeding in them as if it were spring, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He mingled it all together, according to what he felt
was most pressing. Norry seemed to take it as a personal failure
that he had not yet learned who had freed Elenia and Naean, though
less than a week had passed since their rescue. The price of grain
was climbing exorbitantly, along with that of every other sort of
foodstuff, and it was already apparent that repairs to the Palace
roof would take longer and cost more than the masons had first
estimated, but food always grew more expensive as winter went on
and masons always cost more than they first had said they would.
Norry admitted that his last correspondence from New Braem was
several days old, but the Borderlanders appeared content to remain
where they were, which he could not understand. Any army, much less
one as large as this was said to be, ought to be stripping the
countryside around it bare by now. Elayne did not understand why
either, but she was content that it was so. For the time being.
Rumors in Cairhien of Aes Sedai swearing fealty to Rand at least
gave a reason for Egwene&rsquo;s concern, though it hardly seemed
likely any sister would actually do such a thing. That was the
least important piece of news, in Norry&rsquo;s estimation, but not
in hers. Rand could not afford to alienate the sisters with Egwene.
He could not afford to alienate <em>any</em> Aes Sedai. But he did
seem to find ways to do so.</p>

<p>Reene Harfor soon replaced Halwin Norry, nodding to
the bodyguards at the door in passing and giving Aviendha an open
smile. If the plump graying woman had ever been uncertain about
Elayne calling Aviendha sister, she had never shown it, and now she
genuinely appeared to approve. Smiles or no smiles, though, her
report was much more grim than anything in the Chief
Clerk&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jon Skellit is in the pay of House Arawn, my Lady,&rdquo;
Reene said, her round face stern enough to fit a hangman. &ldquo;Twice
now he has been seen accepting a purse from men known to favor
Arawn. And there is no doubt that Ester Norham is in someone&rsquo;s
pay. She isn&rsquo;t stealing, but she has over fifty crowns of gold
hidden under a loose floorboard, and she added ten crowns last
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do as with the others,&rdquo; Elayne said sadly. The First
Maid had uncovered nine spies she was certain of, so far, four of
them employed by people Reene had not yet been able to uncover.
That Reene had found any at all was enough to anger Elayne, but the
barber and the hairdresser were something more. Both had been in
her mother&rsquo;s service. A pity they had not seen fit to transfer
their loyalty to Morgase&rsquo;s daughter.</p>

<p>Aviendha grimaced as Mistress Harfor murmured that
she would, but there was no point in discharging the spies, or
killing them as Aviendha had suggested. They would just be replaced
by spies she did not know. <em>A spy is your enemy&rsquo;s tool
until you know her</em>, her mother had said, <em>but then she is
your tool. When you find a spy</em>, Thom had told her, <em>wrap
him in swaddling and feed him with a spoon</em>. The men and women
who had betrayed their service would be &ldquo;allowed&rdquo; to discover what
Elayne wanted them to know, not all true, such as the numbers
Birgitte had recruited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the other matter, Mistress Harfor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing yet, my Lady, but I have hopes,&rdquo; Reene said
even more grimly than before. &ldquo;I have hopes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Following the First Maid&rsquo;s departure came two
delegations of merchants, first a large group of Kandori with
gem-studded earrings and silver guild-chains draped across their
chests and then, right behind them, half a dozen Illianers with
only a touch of embroidery on otherwise somber coats and dresses.
She used one of the smaller reception rooms. The tapestries
flanking the marble fireplace were of hunting scenes, not the White
Lion, and the polished wooden wall panels were uncarved. They were
merchants, not diplomats, though some seemed to feel slighted that
she offered only wine and did not drink with them. Kandori or
Illianers, they also looked askance at the two Guardswomen who
followed her into the room and posted themselves beside the door,
though if by this time they had not heard the tales of an attempt
to kill her, they must be deaf. Six more of her bodyguard waited
outside the door.</p>

<p>The Kandori studied Aviendha surreptitiously when not
listening attentively to Elayne, and the Illianers avoided looking
at her at all after the first widening of eyes in surprise.
Doubtless they read significance into the presence of an Aiel, even
if she only sat on the floor in a corner and said nothing, but
whether Kandori or Illianers, the merchants wanted the same thing,
reassurance that Elayne would not so anger the Dragon Reborn that
he would interfere with trade by sending his armies and his Aiel to
ravage Andor, though they did not come out and say so. Nor did they
mention that Aiel and the Legion of the Dragon both had large
encampments not many miles from Caemlyn. Their polite questions
about her plans now that she had removed the Dragon banners and the
Banners of Light from Caemlyn were sufficient. She told them what
she told everyone, that Andor would ally itself to the Dragon
Reborn but was not his conquest. In return, they offered vague
wishes for her well-being, suggesting that they supported her claim
to the Lion Throne wholeheartedly without actually saying any such
thing. After all, if she failed, they would want to be welcome in
Andor under whoever did gain the crown.</p>

<p>When the Illianers had made their bows and curtsies
and departed, she closed her eyes for a moment and rubbed her
temples. She still had a meeting with a delegation of glassmakers
before the midday meal, and five more with merchants or craftsfolk
later; a very busy day, full of mealymouthed platitudes and
ambiguity. And with Nynaeve and Merilille gone, it was her turn to
teach the Windfinders again tonight, at best a less pleasant
experience than the worst meeting with merchants. Which might leave
her a little time to study the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> they had
brought out of Ebou Dar before she was so weary that she could no
longer keep her eyes open. It was embarrassing when Aviendha had to
half carry her to bed, but she could not stop. There was too much
to be done and not enough time in a day.</p>

<p>There was almost an hour before the glassmakers, but
Aviendha ruthlessly rode over her suggestion that she might take a
peek at the things from Ebou Dar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has Birgitte been talking to you?&rdquo; Elayne demanded
as her sister all but dragged her up a narrow flight of stone
stairs. Four Guardswomen went ahead, and the others trailed behind,
studiously ignoring what passed between her and Aviendha. Though
she thought that Rasoria Domanche, a stocky Hunter for the Horn
with the blue eyes and yellow hair occasionally found among
Tairens, wore a tiny smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I need her to tell me you spend too many hours
inside and sleep too little?&rdquo; Aviendha replied contemptuously. &ldquo;You
need fresh air.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The air in the high colonnade was certainly fresh.
And crisp, though the sun stood high in a gray sky. A cold breeze
blew around the smooth columns, so the Guardswomen standing ready
to protect her from pigeons had to hang on to their plumed hats.
Perversely, Elayne refused to ignore the chill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dyelin talked to you,&rdquo; she grumbled, shivering.
Dyelin claimed a woman with child needed long walks every day. She
had been quick to remind Elayne that, Daughter-Heir or not, she was
really only the High Seat of House Trakand for the moment, and if
the High Seat of Trakand wanted to talk with the High Seat of
Taravin, she could do it tramping up and down the Palace corridors
or not at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monaelle has borne seven children,&rdquo; Aviendha
replied. &ldquo;She says I must see you get fresh air.&rdquo; Despite no more
than her shawl pulled over her shoulders, she gave no sign of
feeling the wind. But then, Aiel were as good as the sisters at
ignoring the elements. Wrapping her arms around herself, Elayne
scowled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop sulking, sister,&rdquo; Aviendha said. She pointed
down to one of the stableyards, just visible over the white-tiled
roofs. &ldquo;Look, Reanne Corly is already checking to see if Merilille
Ceandevin is returning.&rdquo; The familiar vertical slash of light
appeared in the stableyard and rotated into a hole in the air ten
feet tall and as wide.</p>

<p>Elayne scowled down at Reanne&rsquo;s head. She was
not sulking. Perhaps she should not have taught Reanne to Travel,
since the Kinswoman was not yet Aes Sedai, but none of the other
sisters were strong enough to make the weave work, and if the
Windfinders were allowed to learn, then the few Kinswomen who could
should be allowed, too, in her book. Besides, she could not do
everything herself. Light, had winter been this icy before she
learned to stop heat and cold from touching her?</p>

<p>To her surprise, Merilille rode through the gateway
shaking snow from her dark fur-lined cloak, followed by the
helmeted Guardsmen who had been sent off with her seven days
earlier. Zaida and the Windfinders had been most unpleasant over
her disappearance, to put it mildly, but the Gray had leaped at a
chance to escape them for however long. It had been necessary to
check for her every day, opening a gateway to the same spot, yet
Elayne had not expected her for a week yet at the very best. As the
last of the ten red-cloaked Guards entered the stableyard, the slim
little Gray sister climbed down from her saddle, handed her reins
to a groom, and hurried into the Palace before the woman from the
stables could more than get out of her way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>am</em> enjoying the fresh air,&rdquo; Elayne said,
just keeping her teeth from chattering, &ldquo;but if Merilille is back,
I must go down.&rdquo; Aviendha quirked an eyebrow as if she suspected
the evasion, but she was the first to start for the stairs.
Merilille&rsquo;s return was important, and by her haste, she
brought either very good news or very bad.</p>

<p>By the time Elayne and her sister walked into her
sitting room&mdash;followed by two of the Guardswomen, of course,
who planted themselves beside the doors&mdash;Merilille was
already there. Her damp-spotted cloak lay over the back of a chair,
her pale gray riding gloves were tucked behind her belt, and her
black hair could have used a brush. With purple crescents under her
dark eyes, Merilille&rsquo;s pale face looked as weary as Elayne
felt.</p>

<p>As quickly as she had come up from the stableyard,
she was not alone. Birgitte, frowning pensively, stood with one
hand on the carved mantel over the fireplace. The other gripped her
long golden braid, almost like Nynaeve. Today, she wore voluminous
dark green trousers with her short red coat, a combination to make
the eye flinch. And Captain Mellar made Elayne an elaborate bow,
waving his white-plumed hat about. He had no place here, but she
let him stay, and even gave him a very warm smile. <em>Very</em>
warm.</p>

<p>The plump young maid who had just placed a large
silver tray on one of the sideboards blinked and looked wide-eyed
at Mellar before remembering to make her curtsy on going. Elayne
held her smile until the door closed. Whatever protected her baby,
she was willing to do. There was hot spiced wine on the rope work
tray for everyone else, and weak tea for her. Well, at least it was
hot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was quite lucky,&rdquo; Merilille sighed once she was
seated, giving Mellar an uncertain glance over her winecup. She
knew the tale of him saving Elayne&rsquo;s life, but she had left
before the rumors began. &ldquo;It turned out that Reanne had opened her
gateway not five miles from the Borderlanders. They have not moved
since arriving.&rdquo; Her nose wrinkled. &ldquo;If not for the weather, the
stench of latrines and horse dung would be overpowering. You were
right, Elayne. All four rulers are there, in four camps a few miles
apart. Each holds an army. I found the Shienarans the first day,
and most of my time since has been spent talking with Easar of
Shienar and the other three. We met in a different camp each
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You spent a little time looking too, I hope,&rdquo;
Birgitte said respectfully from in front of the fireplace. She was
respectful with every Aes Sedai except the one she was bonded to.
&ldquo;How many are they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you got an accurate count,&rdquo;
Mellar put in, sounding as though he expected anything but. For
once, his narrow face was unsmiling. Peering into his wine, he
shrugged. &ldquo;Whatever you saw might have some value, though. If there
are enough of them, they may starve themselves before they can
threaten Caemlyn. The largest army in the world is just so many
walking corpses without food and fodder.&rdquo; He laughed. Birgitte
stared at his back darkly, but Elayne lifted a hand slightly at her
side, motioning the other woman to keep silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are not in a good way for food, Captain,&rdquo;
Merilille said coolly, sitting up straighter in spite of her
obvious fatigue, &ldquo;but neither are they starving quite yet. I should
not count on starvation to defeat them, if it comes to that.&rdquo; After
a little time away from the Sea Folk, her big eyes were no longer
perpetually startled, and despite her smooth Aes Sedai composure,
it was plain she had decided to dislike Doilin Mellar no matter
whose life he had saved. &ldquo;As for numbers, something over two
hundred thousand, I should say, and I very much doubt anyone but
their own officers could be more accurate than that. Even hungry,
that is a great many swords.&rdquo; Mellar shrugged again, undisturbed by
Aes Sedai stares.</p>

<p>The slim Gray sister neither looked at him again nor
ignored him in any obvious way; he just seemed to become a piece of
the furniture for her as she went on. &ldquo;There are at least ten
sisters with them, Elayne, though they made a great effort to hide
the fact. Not adherents to Egwene, I should think, though they need
not be Elaida&rsquo;s either. A good many sisters appear to be
sitting to one side until the Tower&rsquo;s troubles are over, I
fear.&rdquo; She sighed again, perhaps not from tiredness this time.</p>

<p>With a grimace, Elayne set her teacup aside. The
kitchens had not sent up any honey, and she really did not like it
bitter. &ldquo;What do they want, Merilille? The rulers, not the
sisters.&rdquo; Ten sisters made that army ten times as dangerous,
especially to Rand. No, to anyone. &ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t been sitting
there in the snow all this time for the joy of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Gray spread her slim hands slightly. &ldquo;Over the
long run, I can only make suppositions. Over the short, they want
to meet you, and as soon as possible. They sent riders toward
Caemlyn when they arrived at New Braem, but this time of year, it
might take another week or more before they arrive here. Tenobia of
Saldaea let slip, or pretended to let slip, that they know you have
some connection to, or least a close acquaintance with, a certain
person in whom they also apparently have an interest. Somehow, they
know of your presence in Falme when certain events took place.&rdquo;
Mellar frowned in confusion, but no one enlightened him. &ldquo;I did not
disclose Traveling, because of those sisters, but I did say I could
return with a reply very soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne exchanged a look with Birgitte, who also
shrugged, though in her case neither from detachment nor from
disdain. The largest hole in Elayne&rsquo;s hopes to use the
Borderlanders to influence her opponents for the throne had been
how to approach sitting rulers while she was merely the High Seat
of Trakand and Daughter-Heir of a deceased queen. Birgitte&rsquo;s
shrug said be thankful for the hole closing, but Elayne wondered
how these people from the Borderlands had learned what very few
others knew. And if they knew, how many more did, too? She <em>
would</em> protect her unborn child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you be willing to go back right away,
Merilille?&rdquo; she asked. The other sister accepted with alacrity, and
with a slight widening of her eyes that suggested she would put up
with any amount of stench to avoid returning to the Windfinders a
little longer. &ldquo;Then we will go together. If they want to meet me
soon, nothing can be sooner than today.&rdquo; They knew too much for
delay. Nothing could be allowed to threaten her child. Nothing!</p>
