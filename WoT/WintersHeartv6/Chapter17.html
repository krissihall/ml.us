<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">C</span>old
winds gusted through the Mol Hara, lifting
Mat&rsquo;s cloak and threatening to freeze the mud caking his
clothing as he and Noal hurried out of the alley. The sun sat on
the rooftops, half-hidden, and the shadows stretched long. With one
hand for his staff and the other gripping the broken cord of the
foxhead, stuffed into a coat pocket where he could snatch it out if
need be, he had to let his cloak go where it would. He ached from
head to foot, the dice rattled warning inside his skull, and he
hardly noticed either thing. He was too busy trying to watch every
direction at once, and wondering just how small a hole that thing
could get through. He found himself uneasily eyeing cracks between
the square&rsquo;s paving stones. Though it hardly seemed likely the
thing would come at him in the open.</p>

<p>A hum carried from surrounding streets, but here only
a slat-ribbed dog moved, running past the fountained statue of
long-dead Queen Nariene. Some said her uplifted hand pointed to the
ocean&rsquo;s bounty that had enriched Ebou Dar, and some that it
pointed in warning of dangers. Others said her successor had wanted
to draw attention to the fact that only one of the statue&rsquo;s
breasts was uncovered, proclaiming that Nariene had only been of
middling honesty.</p>

<p>In other days the Mol Hara would have been full of
strolling lovers and lingering street vendors and hopeful beggars
at this hour even in winter, but beggars found themselves snatched
off the streets and put to work, since the Seanchan came, and the
rest stayed away even in daylight. The reason was the Tarasin
Palace, that great mound of white domes and marble spires and
wrought-iron balconies, the residence of Tylin Quintara Mitsobar,
by the Grace of the Light, Queen of Altara&mdash;or as much of
Altara as lay within a few days&rsquo; ride of Ebou Dar&mdash;Mistress of the Four Winds and Guardian of the Sea of Storms. And,
perhaps more important, the residence of the High Lady Suroth
Sabelle Meldarath, commanding the Forerunners for the Empress of
the Seanchan, might she live forever. A position of much greater
eminence in Ebou Dar, at the moment. Tylin&rsquo;s green-booted
guards stood at every entrance in their baggy white trousers and
gilded breastplates worn over green coats, and so did men and women
in those insectile helmets with armor striped in blue-and-yellow or
green-and-white or any other combination you might happen to think
of. The Queen of Altara required security and silence for her rest.
Or rather, Suroth said she did, and what Suroth said Tylin wanted,
Tylin soon decided that she did indeed want.</p>

<p>After a moment&rsquo;s consideration, Mat led Noal to
one of the stableyard gates. There was more chance of getting a
stranger in there than if he used the grand marble stairs that led
down into the square. Not to mention a much better chance of
getting all the mud off him before he had to face Tylin. She had
made her displeasure markedly known the last time he came back
disheveled, after a tavern brawl.</p>

<p>A handful of Ebou Dari guards stood to one side of
the open gates with halberds, and the same number of Seanchan on
the other with tasseled spears, all as stiff as Nariene&rsquo;s
statue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light&rsquo;s blessing on all here,&rdquo; Mat murmured
politely to the Ebou Dari guards. It was always best to be polite
to Ebou Dari until you were sure of them. Afterwards, too, for that
matter. Even so, they were more&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;flexible&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;than the
Seanchan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And on you, my Lord,&rdquo; their stocky officer replied,
ambling forward, and Mat recognized him, Surlivan Sarat, a good
fellow, always ready with a quip and possessing a fine eye for
horses. Shaking his head, Surlivan tapped the side of his pointed
helmet with the thin, gilded rod of his office. &ldquo;Have you been in
another fight, my Lord? She will go up like a waterspout, when she
sees you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Squaring his shoulders, and trying not to lean so
obviously on his staff, Mat bristled. Ready with a quip? Come to
think on it, the sun-dark man had a tongue like a rasp. And his eye
for horses was not all that fine, either. &ldquo;Will there be any
questions if my friend here beds down with my men?&rdquo; Mat asked
roughly. &ldquo;There shouldn&rsquo;t be. There&rsquo;s room for one more
with my fellows.&rdquo; Room for more than one, truth be told. Eight men
had died so far, for following him to Ebou Dar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None from me, my Lord,&rdquo; Surlivan said, though he
eyed the scrawny man at Mat&rsquo;s side and pursed his lips
judiciously. Noal&rsquo;s coat appeared of good quality, though, at
least in the dim light, and he did have his lace, and in a better
state than Mat&rsquo;s. Perhaps that tipped the balance. &ldquo;And she
doesn&rsquo;t need to know everything, so none from her,
either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat scowled, but before intemperate words could put
himself and Noal in the soup kettle, three armored Seanchan
galloped up to the gate, and Surlivan turned to face them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You and your lady wife live in the Queen&rsquo;s
Palace?&rdquo; Noal inquired, starting toward the gate.</p>

<p>Mat pulled him back. &ldquo;Wait on them,&rdquo; he said, nodding
toward the Seanchan. His lady wife? Bloody women! Bloody dice in
his bloody head!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have dispatches for the High Lady Suroth,&rdquo; one of
the Seanchan announced, slapping a leather satchel hanging from one
armored shoulder. Her helmet bore a single thin plume, marking her
a low-ranking officer, yet her horse was a tall dun gelding with a
look of speed. The other two animals were sturdy enough, but there
was nothing to be said for them beyond that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enter with the blessings of the Light,&rdquo; Surlivan
said, bowing slightly.</p>

<p>The Seanchan woman&rsquo;s bow from her saddle was a
mirror of his. &ldquo;The blessings of the Light be on you also,&rdquo; she
drawled, and the three of them clattered into the stableyard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very strange,&rdquo; Surlivan mused, peering after
the three. &ldquo;They always ask permission of us, not them.&rdquo; He flicked
his rod toward the Seanchan guards on the other side of the gates.
They had not stirred an inch from their rigid stance, or even
glanced at the arrivals that Mat had noticed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what would they do if you said they
couldn&rsquo;t go in?&rdquo; Noal asked quietly, easing the bundle on his
back.</p>

<p>Surlivan spun on his heel. &ldquo;It is enough that I have
given oath to my Queen,&rdquo; he said in an expressionless voice, &ldquo;and
she has given hers&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;where she has given it. Give your friend a
bed, my Lord. And warn him, there are things better left unsaid in
Ebou Dar, questions better left unasked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Noal looked befuddled and began protesting that he
was simply curious, but Mat exchanged further benisons and
courtesies with the Altaran officer&mdash;as quickly as he could,
to be sure&mdash;and hustled his newfound acquaintance through the
gates, explaining about Listeners in a low voice. The man might
have saved his hide from the <em>gholam</em>, but that did not mean
he would let the fellow hand it over to the Seanchan. They had
people called Seekers, too, and from the little he had heard&mdash;even people who spoke freely about the Deathwatch Guard locked
their teeth when it came to the Seekers&mdash;from the little he
had heard, Seekers made Whitecloak Questioners look like boys
tormenting flies, nasty but hardly anything to worry a man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; the old man said slowly. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t
known that.&rdquo; He sounded irritated with himself. &ldquo;You must spend a
good deal of time with the Seanchan. Do you know the High Lady
Suroth as well, then? I must say, I had no idea you had such high
connections.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I spend time with soldiers in taverns, when I can,&rdquo;
Mat replied sourly. When Tylin let him. Light, he might as well be
married! &ldquo;Suroth doesn&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m alive.&rdquo; And he devoutly
hoped it remained that way.</p>

<p>The three Seanchan were already out of sight, their
horses being led into the stables, but several dozen <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em> were giving <em>damane</em> their evening
exercise, walking them in a big circle around the stone-paved yard.
Nearly half the gray-clad <em>damane</em> were dark-skinned women,
lacking the jewelry they had worn as Windfinders. There were more
like them in the Palace and elsewhere; the Seanchan had had a rich
harvest from Sea Folk vessels that had failed to escape. Most wore
sullen resignation or stony faces, but seven or eight stared ahead
of them, lost and confused, disbelieving still. Each of those had a
Seanchan-born <em>damane</em> at her side, holding her hand or with
an arm around her, smiling and whispering to her under the
approving eyes of the women who wore the bracelets attached to
their silvery collars. A few of those dazed women clutched the <em>
damane</em> walking with them as if holding to lifelines. It would
have been enough to make Mat shiver, if his damp clothes had not
already been doing the job.</p>

<p>He tried to hurry Noal across the yard, but the
circle brought a <em>damane</em> who was neither Seanchan nor
Atha&rsquo;an Miere near him, linked to a plump, graying <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em>, an olive-skinned woman who might have passed for
Altaran and someone&rsquo;s mother. A stern mother with a possibly
fractious child, from the way she regarded her charge. Teslyn
Baradon had fleshed out after a month and a half in Seanchan
captivity, yet her ageless face still looked as if she ate briars
three meals a day. On the other hand, she walked placidly on her
leash and obeyed the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>&rsquo;s murmured
directions without hesitation, pausing to bow very deeply to him
and Noal. For an instant, though, her dark eyes flashed hatred at
him before she and the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> continued their
circuit of the stable-yard. Placidly, obediently. He had seen <em>
damane</em> upended and switched till they howled in this same
stableyard for making any sort of fuss, Teslyn among them. She had
done him no good turns, and maybe a few bad, but he would not have
wished this on her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better than being dead, I suppose,&rdquo; he muttered,
moving on. Teslyn was a hard woman, likely plotting every moment
how to escape, yet hardness only took you so far. The Mistress of
the Ships and her Master of the Blades had died on the stake
without ever screaming, but it had not saved them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you believe that?&rdquo; Noal asked absently, fumbling
awkwardly with his bundle again. His broken hands had handled that
knife well enough, but they seemed clumsy at everything else.</p>

<p>Mat frowned at him. No; he was not sure he believed
it. Those silver <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> seemed too much like the
invisible collar Tylin had on him. Then again, Tylin could tickle
him under the chin the rest of his life if it kept him off the
stake. Light, he wished those bloody dice in his head would just
stop and get it over with! No, that was a lie. Since he had finally
realized what they meant, he had never wanted the dice to stop.</p>

<p>The room Chel Vanin and the surviving Redarms shared
lay not far from the stables, a long white-plastered chamber with a
low ceiling and too many beds for those who remained alive. Vanin,
a balding suety heap, was lying on one in his shirtsleeves, an open
book propped on his chest. Mat was surprised the man <em>could</em>
read. Spitting through a gap in his teeth, Vanin eyed Mat&rsquo;s
mud-smeared clothes. &ldquo;You been fighting again?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;She
won&rsquo;t like that, I reckon.&rdquo; He did not rise. With a few
startling exceptions, Vanin considered himself as good as any lord
or lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trouble, Lord Mat?&rdquo; Harnan growled, leaping to his
feet. He was a solid man, physically and by temperament, but his
heavy jaw clenched, twisting the hawk crudely tattooed on his
cheek. &ldquo;Begging your pardon, but you&rsquo;re in no condition for
it. Tell us what he looks like, and we&rsquo;ll sort him out for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The last three gathered behind him with eager
expressions, two grabbing for their coats while still tucking in
shirttails. Metwyn, a boyish-appearing Cairhienin who was ten years
older than Mat, instead picked up his sword from where it was
propped at the foot of his bed and eased a little of the blade out
of the scabbard to check the edge. He was the best of them with a
sword, very good indeed, though Gorderan came close for all he
looked a blacksmith. Gorderan was not nearly as slow as his thick
shoulders made him appear. A dozen Redarms had followed Mat Cauthon
to Ebou Dar, eight of those were dead, and the rest were stuck here
in the Palace where they could not pinch the maids, get into a
fight over dice, and drink till they fell on their faces, as they
could have staying at an inn and knowing the innkeeper would see
them carried up to their beds, though maybe with their purses a
little lighter than they had been.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Noal here can tell you what happened better than I
can,&rdquo; Mat replied, pushing his hat back on his head. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be
bedding in here with you. He saved my life tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That brought exclamations of shock, and cries of
approbation for Noal, not to mention slaps on the back that almost
toppled the old fellow. Vanin went so far as to mark his place in
the book with a fat finger and sit up on the side of his thin
mattress.</p>

<p>Setting his bundle down on a vacant bed, Noal told
the tale with elaborate gestures, playing down his own role and
even making himself a bit of a buffoon, slipping in the mud and
gaping at the <em>gholam</em> while Mat fought like a champion. The
man was a natural storyteller, as good as a gleeman for making you
see what he described. Harnan and the Redarms laughed genially,
knowing what he was about, not stealing their captain&rsquo;s
thunder, and approving of it, but laughter died when he came to
Mat&rsquo;s attacker slipping away through a tiny hole in a wall. He
made you see that, too. Vanin put down his book and spat through
his teeth again. The <em>gholam</em> had left Vanin and Harnan
half-dead in the Rahad. Half-dead because it was after other
prey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The thing wants me for some reason, it seems,&rdquo; Mat
said lightly when the old man finished and sank onto the bed with
his belongings, seemingly exhausted. &ldquo;It probably played at dice
with me some time I don&rsquo;t recall. None of you has to worry, as
long as you don&rsquo;t get between it and me.&rdquo; He grinned, trying
to make it all a joke, but no one so much as smiled. &ldquo;In any case,
I&rsquo;ll parcel out gold to you in the morning. You&rsquo;ll book
passage on the first ship leaving for Illian, and take Olver with
you. Thom and Juilin, too, if they&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo; He imagined the
thief-catcher would, anyway. &ldquo;And Nerim and Lopin, of course.&rdquo; He
had gotten used to having a pair of serving men look after him, but
he hardly needed them here. &ldquo;Talmanes must be somewhere close to
Caemlyn by this time. You shouldn&rsquo;t have much trouble finding
him.&rdquo; When they were gone, he would be alone with Tylin. Light, he
would rather face the <em>gholam</em> again!</p>

<p>Harnan and the other three Redarms exchanged looks,
Fergin scratching his head as it he did not quite understand. He
might not. The bony man was a good soldier&mdash;not the best,
mind, but good enough&mdash;yet he was not very bright when it
came to other things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t be right,&rdquo; Harnan allowed
finally. &ldquo;One thing, Lord Talmanes&rsquo;d have our hides if we came
back without you.&rdquo; The other three nodded. Fergin could understand
that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, Vanin?&rdquo; Mat asked.</p>

<p>The fat man shrugged. &ldquo;I take that boy away from
Riselle, and he&rsquo;ll gut me like a trout the first time I go to
sleep. I would myself, in his boots. Anyway, I got time to read,
here. Don&rsquo;t get much chance for that working as a farrier.&rdquo;
That was one of the itinerant trades he claimed to follow. The
other was stableman. In truth, he was a horsethief and poacher, the
best in two countries and maybe more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all mad,&rdquo; Mat said with a frown. &ldquo;Just
because it wants me, doesn&rsquo;t mean it won&rsquo;t kill you if
you get in the way. The offer stays open. Anyone who comes to his
senses can go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen your like before,&rdquo; Noal said suddenly.
The stooped old man was the image of hard age and exhaustion, but
his eyes were bright and sharp studying Mat. &ldquo;Some men have an air
about them that makes other men follow where they lead. Some lead
to devastation, others to glory. I think your name may go into the
history books.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harnan looked as confused as Fergin. Vanin spat and
lay back down, opening his book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If all my luck goes away, maybe,&rdquo; Mat muttered. He
knew what it took to get into the histories. A man could get
killed, doing that sort of thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better clean up before she sees you,&rdquo; Fergin piped
up suddenly. &ldquo;All that mud will put a burr under her saddle for
sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Snatching his hat off angrily, Mat stalked out
without a word. Well, he stalked as well as he could, hobbling on a
walking staff. Before the door closed behind him, he heard Noal
starting a story about one time he sailed on a Sea Folk ship and
learned to bathe in cold salt water. At least, that was how it
began.</p>

<p>He intended to get himself clean before Tylin saw him&mdash;he did&mdash;but as he limped through hallways hung with
the flowered tapestries Ebou Dari called summer-hangings, for the
season they evoked, four serving men in the Palace&rsquo;s
green-and-white livery and no fewer than seven maids suggested he
might want to bathe and change his clothes before the Queen saw
him, offering to draw him a bath and fetch clean garments without
her learning of it. They did not know everything about him and
Tylin, thank the Light&mdash;no one but Tylin and himself knew the
worst bits&mdash;but they knew too bloody much. Worse, they
approved, every last flaming servant in the whole flaming Tarasin
Palace. For one thing, Tylin was Queen and could do as she pleased,
so far as they were concerned. For another, her temper had been on
a razor&rsquo;s edge since the Seanchan captured the city, and if
Mat Cauthon scrubbed and bright in lace kept her from snapping
their noses off for trifles, then they would scrub behind his ears
and wrap him in lace like a Sunday gift!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mud?&rdquo; he said to a pretty, smiling maid spreading
her skirts in a curtsy. There was a twinkle in her dark eyes, and
the plunging neckline of her bodice displayed a fair amount of
bosom to almost rival Riselle&rsquo;s. On another day he might have
taken a little time to enjoy looking. &ldquo;What mud? I don&rsquo;t see
any mud!&rdquo; Her mouth dropped open, and she forgot to straighten,
staring at him with her knees bent as he hobbled away.</p>

<p>Juilin Sandar, rounding a corner quickly, nearly
walked into him. The Tairen thief-catcher leaped back with a
muffled oath, his swarthy face turning gray until he realized who
had almost run him over. Then he muttered an apology and started to
hurry on by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has Thom got you mixed into his foolishness,
Juilin?&rdquo; Mat said. Juilin and Thom shared a room deep in the
servants&rsquo; quarters, and there was no excuse for him to be up
here. In that dark Tairen coat, flaring over his boot tops, Juilin
would stand out among the servants like a duck in a chicken coop.
Suroth was strict about things like that, stricter than Tylin. The
only reason for it Mat could see was whatever Thom and Beslan were
meddling with. &ldquo;No; don&rsquo;t bother telling me. I&rsquo;ve made an
offer to Harnan and the others, and it&rsquo;s open to you, too. If
you want to leave, I&rsquo;ll give you the money for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Actually, Juilin did not look ready to tell him
anything. The thief-catcher tucked his thumbs behind his belt and
met Mat&rsquo;s gaze levelly. &ldquo;What did Harnan and the others say?
And what is Thom doing that you call foolish? This is one set of
rooftops he knows his way around better than you or I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <em>gholam</em> is still in Ebou Dar, Juilin.&rdquo;
Thom knew that the Game of Houses was what <em>he</em> knew, and he
loved sticking his nose into politics. &ldquo;The thing tried to kill me,
earlier this evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Juilin grunted as if he had been hit in the pit of
his belly, and scrubbed a hand through his short black hair. &ldquo;I
have a reason to stay a while longer,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;even so.&rdquo; His air
changed slightly, to something stubborn and defensive and tinged
with guilt. He had never shown a roving eye that Mat had seen, but
when a man looked like that, it could only mean one thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take her with you,&rdquo; Mat said. &ldquo;And if she won&rsquo;t
go, well, you&rsquo;ll not be in Tear an hour before you have a
woman on each knee. That&rsquo;s the thing about women, Juilin. If
one says no, there&rsquo;s always another will say yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A serving man hurrying by with an armload of linen
towels stared at Mat&rsquo;s muddiness in amazement, but Juilin
thought it was at him, and snatched his thumbs free of his belt and
at tempted to adopt a more humble stance. Without much success.
Thom might sleep with the servants, yet from the beginning he had
somehow made it seem to be his own choice, an eccentricity, and no
one thought it odd to see him up here, perhaps slipping into
Riselle&rsquo;s rooms that had once been Mat&rsquo;s. Juilin had gone
on at length about being a thief-catcher&mdash;never a
thief-<em>taker</em>&mdash;and stared so many prickly lordlings
and complacent merchants in the eye to show he was as good as they
that everyone in the Palace knew who and what he was. And where he
was supposed to be, which was belowstairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord is wise,&rdquo; he said, too loudly, and making a
stiff, jerky bow. &ldquo;My Lord knows all about women. If my Lord will
forgive a humble man, I must return to my place.&rdquo; Turning to go, he
spoke over his shoulder, still in a carrying voice. &ldquo;I heard today
that if my Lord comes back one more time looking like he&rsquo;s
been dragged in the street, the Queen intends taking a switch to my
Lord&rsquo;s person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And that was the stone that broke the wagon clean in
two.</p>

<p>Flinging open the doors of Tylin&rsquo;s apartments,
Mat strode in, sailed his hat across the width of the room&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;And stopped dead, his mouth hanging open and everything he had
planned to say frozen on his tongue. His hat hit the carpets and
rolled, he did not see where. A gust of wind rattled the tall
triple-arched windows that let out onto a long, screened balcony
overlooking the Mol Hara.</p>

<p>Tylin turned in a chair carved to look like gilded
bamboo and stared at him over her golden winecup. Waves of glossy
black hair touched with gray at the temples framed a beautiful face
with the eyes of a bird of prey, and not one best pleased at the
moment. Inconsequential things seemed to leap at him. She kicked
her crossed leg slightly, rippling layered green and white
petticoats. Pale green lace trimmed the oval opening in her gown
that half exposed her full breasts, where the jeweled hilt of her
marriage knife dangled. She was not alone. Suroth sat facing her,
frowning into her winecup and tapping long fingernails on the arm
of her chair, a pretty enough woman despite her hair being shaved
to that long crest, except that she made Tylin seem a rabbit by
comparison. Two of those fingernails on each hand were lacquered
blue. Seated at her side was a little girl, of all things, also in
an elaborately flowered robe over pleated white skirts, but with a
sheer veil covering her entire head&mdash;it seemed to be shaved
completely!&mdash;and wearing a fortune in rubies. Even in a state
of shock, he noticed rubies and gold. A slender woman, nearly as
dark as her stark black gown and tall even had she been Aiel, stood
behind the girl&rsquo;s chair with her arms folded and ill-concealed
impatience. Her wavy black hair was short, but not shaved at all,
so she was neither of the Blood nor <em>so&rsquo;jhin</em>.
Imperiously beautiful, she put Tylin and Suroth both in the shade.
He noticed beautiful women, too, even when he did feel hit in the
head with a hammer.</p>

<p>It was not the presence of Suroth or the strangers
that jerked him to a halt, though. The dice had stopped, landing
with a thunder that made his skull ring. That had never happened
before. He stood there waiting for one of the Forsaken to leap out
of the flames in the marble fireplace, or the earth to swallow the
Palace beneath him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t listening to me, pigeon,&rdquo; Tylin
cooed in dangerous tones. &ldquo;I said, take yourself down to the
kitchens and have a pastry until I have time for you. Have a bath
while you&rsquo;re about it.&rdquo; Her dark eyes glittered. &ldquo;We will
discuss your mud later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a daze, he ran it through again in his head. He
had walked into the room, the dice had stopped, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Nothing
had happened. Nothing!</p>

<p>&ldquo;This man has been set upon,&rdquo; the tiny, veiled figure
said, rising. Her tone turned cold as the wind outside. &ldquo;You told
me the streets were safe, Suroth! I am displeased.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something <em>had</em> to happen! It already should
have! Something always happened when the dice stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I assure you, Tuon, the streets of Ebou Dar are as
safe as the streets of Seandar itself,&rdquo; Suroth replied, and that
pulled Mat out of his stupor. She sounded&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;anxious. Suroth
made other people anxious.</p>

<p>A slender, graceful young man in the almost
transparent robe of a <em>da&rsquo;covale</em> appeared at her side
with a tall blue porcelain pitcher, bowing his head and silently
offering to replenish her wine. And giving Mat another start. He
had not realized anyone else was present in the room. The
yellow-haired man in his indecent garment was not the only one,
either. A slim but nicely rounded red-haired woman wearing the same
sheer robe was kneeling beside a table that held spice bottles and
more fine Sea Folk porcelain wine pitchers and a small gilded brass
brazier with the pokers needed for heating the wine, while a
graying nervous-eyed serving woman wearing green-and-white House
Mitsobar livery stood at the other end. And in one corner, so
motionless that he still almost missed her, yet another Seanchan, a
short woman with half her golden head shaved and a bosom that might
outmatch Riselle&rsquo;s if her dress of red-and-yellow panels had
not covered her neck to the chin. Not that he had any real desire
to find out. Seanchan were very touchy about their <em>
so&rsquo;jhin</em>. Tylin was touchy about any woman. There had not
been a serving woman younger than his grandmother in her apartments
since he was able to get out of bed.</p>

<p>Suroth looked at the graceful man as though wondering
what he was, then shook her head wordlessly and turned her
attention back to the child, Tuon, who waved the fellow away. The
liveried serving maid scurried forward to take the pitcher from him
and try to refill Tylin&rsquo;s cup, but the Queen made a very small
gesture that sent her back to the wall. Tylin was sitting very,
very still. Little wonder that she wanted to avoid notice if this
Tuon frightened Suroth, as she plainly did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am displeased, Suroth,&rdquo; the girl said again,
sternly frowning down at the other woman. Even standing, she did
not have all that far down to stare at the seated High Lady. Mat
supposed she must be a High Lady, too, only Higher than Suroth.
&ldquo;You have recovered much, and that will please the Empress, may she
live forever, but your ill-considered attack eastward was a
disaster that must not be repeated. And if the streets of this city
are safe, how can he have been set upon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suroth&rsquo;s knuckles were white from gripping the
chair arm, and her winecup. She glared at Tylin as though the
lecture were her fault, and Tylin gave her an apologetic smile and
bowed her head. Oh, blood and ashes, he was going to pay for
that!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fell down, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; His voice might as
well have been fireworks for the way heads whipped around. Suroth
and Tuon looked shocked that he had spoken. Tylin looked like an
eagle who wanted her rabbit fried. &ldquo;My Ladies,&rdquo; he added, but that
did not seem to improve anything.</p>

<p>The tall woman suddenly reached out and snatched the
wine-cup from Tuon&rsquo;s hand, throwing it into the fireplace.
Sparks showered up the chimney. The serving woman stirred as if to
retrieve the cup before it could be damaged further, then subsided
at a touch from the <em>so&rsquo;jhin</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are being foolish, Tuon,&rdquo; the tall woman said,
and her voice made the girl&rsquo;s sternness seem laughter. The
too-familiar Seanchan drawl seemed almost absent entirely. &ldquo;Suroth
has the situation here well in her control. What happened to the
east can happen in any battle. You must stop wasting time on
ridiculous trifles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suroth gaped at her in astonishment for an instant
before she could assume a frozen mask. Mat did a little gaping on
his own part. Use that tone of voice to one of the Blood, and you
were lucky to escape with a trip to the flogging post!</p>

<p>Shockingly, Tuon inclined her head slightly. &ldquo;You may
be right, Anath,&rdquo; she said calmly, and even with a touch of
deference. &ldquo;Time and the omens will tell. But the young man plainly
is lying. Perhaps he fears Tylin&rsquo;s anger. But his injuries
clearly are more than he could sustain falling down unless there
are cliffs in the city I have not seen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he feared Tylin&rsquo;s anger, did he? Well, come
to that, he did, a little. Only a little, mind. But he did not like
being reminded of it. Leaning on his shoulder-high staff, he tried
to make himself comfortable. They could ask a man to sit, after
all. &ldquo;I was hurt the day your lads took the city,&rdquo; he said with his
cheekiest grin. &ldquo;Your lot were flinging around lightning and balls
of fire something fierce. I&rsquo;m just about healed, though, thank
you for asking.&rdquo; Tylin buried her face in her winecup, and still
managed to shoot him a look over the rim that promised retribution
later.</p>

<p>Tuon&rsquo;s skirts rustled as she crossed the carpets
to him. The dark face behind that sheer veil might have been
pretty, without the expression of a judge passing sentence of
death. And with a decent head of hair instead of a bald pate. Her
eyes were large and liquid, but utterly impersonal. All of her long
fingernails were lacquered, he noticed, a bright red. He wondered
whether that signified anything. Light, a man could live in luxury
for years on the price of those rubies.</p>

<p>She reached up with one hand, putting her fingertips
under his chin, and he started to jerk back. Until Tylin glared at
him over Tuon&rsquo;s head, promising retribution here and now, if
he did any such thing. Glowering, he let the girl shift his head
for her study.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You fought us?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;You have sworn the
oaths?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I swore,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;For the other, I had no
chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you would have,&rdquo; she murmured. Circling him
slowly, she continued her study, fingering the lace at his wrist,
touching the black silk scarf tied around his neck, lifting the
edge of his cloak to examine the embroidery. He endured it,
refusing to shift his stance, glowering fit to match Tylin. Light,
he had bought horses without so thorough an examination! Next, she
would want to look at his teeth!</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boy told you how he was injured,&rdquo; Anath said in
frosty tones of command. &ldquo;If you want him, then buy him and be
done. The day has been long, and you should be in your bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tuon paused, examining the long signet ring on his
finger. It had been carved as a try-piece, to show the
carver&rsquo;s skills, a running fox and two ravens in flight, all
surrounded by crescent moons, and he had bought it by chance,
though he had come to like it. He wondered whether she wanted it.
Straightening, she stared up at his face. &ldquo;Good advice, Anath,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;How much for him, Tylin? If he is a favorite, name your
price, and I will double it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tylin choked on her wine and began coughing. Mat
almost fell off his staff. The girl wanted to <em>buy</em> him?
Well, she might as well have been looking at a horse for all the
expression on her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a free man, High Lady,&rdquo; Tylin said unsteadily
when she could speak. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I cannot sell him.&rdquo; Mat could have
laughed, if Tylin did not sound as though she were trying to keep
her teeth from chattering, if bloody Tuon had not just asked his
price. A free man! Ha!</p>

<p>The girl turned away from him as though dismissing
him from her mind. &ldquo;You are afraid, Tylin, and under the Light, you
should not be.&rdquo; Gliding to Tylin&rsquo;s chair, she lifted her veil
with both hands, baring the lower half of her face, and bent to
kiss Tylin lightly, once on each eye and once on the lips. Tylin
looked astounded. &ldquo;You are a sister to me, and to Suroth,&rdquo; Tuon
said in a surprisingly gentle voice. &ldquo;I myself will write your name
as one of the Blood. You will be the High Lady Tylin as well as
Queen of Altara, and more, as was promised you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anath snorted, loudly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Anath, I know,&rdquo; the girl sighed, straightening
and lowering her veil. &ldquo;The day has been long and arduous, and I am
weary. But I will show Tylin what lands are in mind for her, so she
will know and be easy in her mind. There are maps in my chambers,
Tylin. You will honor me by accompanying me, there? I have
excellent masseuses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The honor is mine,&rdquo; Tylin said, sounding not all
that much steadier than before.</p>

<p>At a gesture from the <em>so&rsquo;jhin</em>, the
yellow-haired man went running to open the door and kneel holding
it open, but there was still all the smoothing and adjusting of
clothes that women had to do before they would go anywhere,
Seanchan or Altaran or from anywhere else. Though, the red-haired
<em>da&rsquo;covale</em> performed the function for Tuon and Suroth.
Mat took the opportunity to draw Tylin a little aside, far enough
that he would not be overheard. The <em>so&rsquo;jhin</em>&rsquo;s
blue eyes kept coming back to him, he realized, but at least Tuon,
accepting the attentions of the slender <em>da&rsquo;covale</em>
woman, seemed to have forgotten he existed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t just fall down,&rdquo; he told Tylin softly.
&ldquo;The <em>gholam</em> tried to kill me not much more than an hour
ago. It might be best if I left. That thing wants me, and
it&rsquo;ll kill anybody near me, too.&rdquo; The plan had just occurred
to him, but he thought it had a good chance of success.</p>

<p>Tylin sniffed. &ldquo;He&mdash;it&mdash;it cannot have
you, piglet.&rdquo; She directed a look at Tuon that might have made the
girl forget about Tylin being a sister had she seen. &ldquo;And neither
can she.&rdquo; At least she had sense enough to whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; he asked. Well, it had never been more
than a chance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The High Lady Tuon, and you know as much as I,&rdquo;
Tylin replied, just as quietly. &ldquo;Suroth jumps when she speaks, and
she jumps when Anath speaks, though I would almost swear that Anath
is some sort of servant. They are a very peculiar people,
sweetling.&rdquo; Suddenly she flaked some mud from his cheek with one
finger. He had not realized he had mud on his face, too. Suddenly,
the eagle was strong in her eyes. &ldquo;Do you recall the pink ribbons,
sweetling? When I come back, we&rsquo;ll see how you look in
pink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She swanned out of the room with Tuon and Suroth,
trailed by Anath and the <em>so&rsquo;jhin</em> and the <em>
da&rsquo;covale</em>, leaving Mat with the grandmotherly serving
woman who began to clean up the wine table. He sank into one of the
bamboo carved chairs and rested his head in his hands.</p>

<p>Any other time, those pink ribbons would have had him
gibbering. He never should have tried to get his own back with her.
Even the <em>gholam</em> did not occupy much of his thoughts. The
dice had stopped and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;What? He had come face-to-face, or near
enough, with three people he had not met before, but that could not
be it. Maybe it was something to do with Tylin becoming one of the
Blood. But always before, when the dice stopped, something had
happened to him, personally.</p>

<p>He sat there worrying over it while the serving woman
called in others to carry everything away, sat there until Tylin
returned. She had not forgotten about the pink ribbons, and that
made him forget about anything else for quite a long time.</p>
