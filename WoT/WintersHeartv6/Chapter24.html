<h4><em>Among the Counsels</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">S</span>omeone
shook Shalon&rsquo;s arm. It was Sarene, and
the Aes Sedai was talking to her. &ldquo;It is in there,&rdquo; Sarene said,
&ldquo;in the Hall of the Counsels. Beneath the dome.&rdquo; Withdrawing her
hand, she took a deep breath and gathered her reins. &ldquo;It is
ridiculous to think that the effect is any worse just because we
are close,&rdquo; she muttered, &ldquo;but it does feel so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shalon roused herself with an effort. The emptiness
would not go away, but she forced herself to ignore it. Yet in
truth she felt cored like a piece of fruit.</p>

<p>They were in a huge&mdash;she supposed it was still
called a square, though this one was round&mdash;a huge square
paved with white stone. At the center stood a great palace, a round
structure all of white except for the tall blue dome on top, like
half of a ball. Massive fluted columns surrounded the upper two
levels below the dome, and a steady stream of people flowed up and
down the broad white stone stairs leading up to the second level on
either side. Except for a pair of tall arched bronze gates standing
open directly ahead of them, the lowest level was all white stone
carved with diademed women more than twice life-size, and between
them, white stone sheaves of grain and bolts of cloth that seemed
to have their free ends rippling in a wind, and stacks of ingots
that might have been meant for gold or silver or iron or perhaps
all three, and sacks spilling out what looked coins and gemstones.
Beneath the women&rsquo;s feet, much smaller white stone figures
drove wagons and worked forges and looms in a continuous band.
These people had made a monument proclaiming their success at
trade. That was foolish. When people decided you were better at
trade than they, they not only grew jealous, they became stubborn
and tried to demand ridiculous bargains. And sometimes you had no
alternative save to accept.</p>

<p>She realized that Harine was frowning at her, and
straightened herself in the saddle. &ldquo;Forgive me, Wavemistress,&rdquo; she
said. The Source was gone, but it would return&mdash;of course it
would!&mdash;and she had her duty. She was ashamed that she had
let herself give in to fear, yet the emptiness remained. Oh, Light,
the emptiness! &ldquo;I am better, now. I will do better from here on.&rdquo;
Harine merely nodded, still frowning, and Shalon&rsquo;s scalp
prickled. When Harine failed to deliver an expected tongue-lashing,
it was because she intended to deliver worse.</p>

<p>Cadsuane rode straight across the square and through
the Hall of the Counsels&rsquo; open gates into a large,
high-ceilinged room that appeared to be an indoor stableyard. A
dozen men in blue coats, squatting beside sedan chairs with both a
golden sword and a golden hand painted on the doors, looked up in
surprise when they rode in. So did the men in blue vests who were
unharnessing the team from a coach with the sword-and-hand sigil,
and those sweeping the stone floor with large pushbrooms. Two more
grooms were leading horses down a wide corridor that gave off the
smell of hay and dung.</p>

<p>A plump, smooth-cheeked man in his middle years came
scurrying across the paving stones, bobbing his head in small bows
and dry-washing his hands. Where the other men had their long hair
tied at the nape of the neck, his was caught with a small silver
clip, and his blue coat appeared of good quality wool, with the
golden Sword-and-Hand embroidered large on his left breast.
&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he said with an unctuous smile, &ldquo;I mean no offense,
but I fear you must have mistaken your direction. This is the Hall
of the Counsels, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell First Counsel Barsalla that Cadsuane Melaidhrin
is here to see her,&rdquo; Cadsuane broke in on him as she
dismounted.</p>

<p>The man&rsquo;s smile slid off to one side, and his
eyes widened. &ldquo;Cadsuane Melaidhrin? I thought you were&mdash;!&rdquo; He
cut himself short at her suddenly hard stare, then coughed into his
hand and reassumed his fulsome smile. &ldquo;Forgive me, Cadsuane Sedai.
Will you allow me to show you and your companions to a waiting room
where you can receive welcome while I send word to the First
Counsel?&rdquo; His eyes widened slightly as he took in those companions.
Plainly he, too, could recognize Aes Sedai, at least in a group.
Shalon and Harine made him blink, but he had self-control, for one
of the shorebound. He did not gape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll allow you to run tell Aleis I&rsquo;m here
as fast as your legs can carry you, boy,&rdquo; Cadsuane replied,
unfastening her cloak and tossing it across her saddle. &ldquo;Tell her
I&rsquo;ll be in the dome, and tell her I don&rsquo;t have all day.
Well? Hop!&rdquo; This time the man&rsquo;s smile did not slide, it turned
sickly, but he only hesitated a moment before setting off at a dead
run while shouting for grooms to come take the horses.</p>

<p>Cadsuane had dismissed him from her attention as soon
as she finished giving him his orders, however. &ldquo;Verin, Kumira, you
two will come with me,&rdquo; she announced briskly. &ldquo;Merise, keep
everyone together and ready until I&mdash;Alanna, come back and
dismount. Alanna!&rdquo; Reluctantly Alanna turned her mount away from
the gates and climbed down with a sulky glower. Her slim Warder,
Ihvon, watched her anxiously. Cadsuane sighed as though her
patience was almost at an end. &ldquo;Sit on her if you must to keep her
here, Merise,&rdquo; she said, handing her reins to a small, wiry groom.
&ldquo;I want everyone ready to leave when I&rsquo;m done with Aleis.&rdquo;
Merise nodded, and Cadsuane turned to the groom. &ldquo;A little water is
all he needs,&rdquo; she said, giving her horse an affectionate pat. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t exercised him much today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shalon was more than happy to turn her own horse over
to a groom without instructions. She would not mind if he killed
the creature. She did not know how far she had ridden in a daze,
but she felt as though she had been in that saddle every mile of
the however many hundred leagues to Cairhien. She felt rumpled in
her flesh as well as her clothes. Abruptly, she realized that
Jahar&rsquo;s pretty face was not with the other men. Verin&rsquo;s
Tomas, a stocky gray-head as hard as any of the others, was leading
the spotted gray pack animal that had been Jahar&rsquo;s. Where had
the young man gotten to? Merise certainly did not appear concerned
by his absence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This First Counsel,&rdquo; Harine growled, letting Moad
help her down. She moved as stiffly as Shalon. He had simply leapt
from his horse. &ldquo;She is an important woman here, Sarene?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might say she is the ruler of Far Madding,
though the other Counsels, they call her first among equals,
whatever that is supposed to mean.&rdquo; Handing over her own mount to a
groom, Sarene looked quite unrumpled. Perhaps she had been upset
before over this <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> that stole the Source,
but now she was all cool detachment, like carved ice. The groom
stumbled over his own feet looking at her face. &ldquo;Once, the First
Counsel, she advised the queens of Maredo, but since Maredo&rsquo;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;dissolution&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;most First Counsels have considered
themselves the natural heirs of Maredo&rsquo;s rulers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shalon knew that her knowledge of the
shorebound&rsquo;s history was as uncertain as her knowledge of
geography away from the shore, but she had never heard of any
nation called Maredo. It was enough for Harine, though. If this
First Counsel ruled here, the Wavemistress of Clan Shodein must
meet her. Harine&rsquo;s dignity demanded no less. She hobbled
determinedly across the stableyard to Cadsuane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; the insufferable Aes Sedai said before
Harine could more than open her mouth. &ldquo;You will come with me, as
well. And your sister. I think not your Swordmaster, though. A man
in the dome would be bad enough, but a man with a sword might make
the Counsels fall over in fits. You have a question, Wavemistress?&rdquo;
Harine snapped her mouth shut with an audible click of teeth.
&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Cadsuane murmured. Shalon groaned. This was not improving
her sister&rsquo;s temper by a feather.</p>

<p>Cadsuane led them along broad, blue-tiled corridors
hung with bright tapestries and lit by gilded stand lamps with
glittering mirrors, where servants in blue first stared at them in
surprise, then made hasty shorebound courtesies as they passed. She
led them up long, swooping flights of white stone stairs that hung
unsupported except where they touched a pale wall, which they did
not always. Cadsuane glided like a swan, but at a speed that made
the ache in Shalon&rsquo;s legs begin to burn. Harine&rsquo;s face
set in a wooden mask, hiding the effort of trotting up stairs. Even
Kumira seemed a trifle surprised, though Cadsuane&rsquo;s pace
caused her no apparent exertion. Round little Verin churned away at
Cadsuane&rsquo;s side, now and then smiling over her shoulder at
Harine and Shalon. Sometimes Shalon thought she hated Verin, but
there was no spite or amusement in those smiles, only
encouragement.</p>

<p>Cadsuane took them up a final curling flight of
stairs, enclosed by walls, and suddenly they were on a balcony
with an intricate, gilded metal railing that ran all the way around&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;For a moment, Shalon gaped. Above her rose an overarching
blue dome a hundred feet or more high at its peak. Nothing held it
up but itself. Her ignorance of the shorebound extended to
architecture as well as geography and history&mdash;and Aes Sedai&mdash;in fact, her ignorance of the shorebound was almost
complete, excepting only Cairhien. She knew how to draw the plans
for a raker and see it built, but she could not begin to imagine
how to construct this.</p>

<p>Arched doorways edged with white stone, like the one
they had come through, marked stairs at three other places around
the long balcony, but they were alone, and that seemed to please
Cadsuane, though all she did was nod to herself. &ldquo;Kumira, show the
Wavemistress and her sister Far Madding&rsquo;s guardian.&rdquo; Her voice
echoed faintly inside the vast dome. She drew Verin a little
distance away, and the pair of them put their heads together. There
was no echo of what they whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must forgive them,&rdquo; Kumira told Harine and
Shalon quietly. Even that produced a slight sound, if not quite an
echo. &ldquo;Peace, but this must be awkward, even for Cadsuane.&rdquo; She ran
her fingers through her short brown hair and shook her head to
settle it back in place. &ldquo;The Counsels are seldom happy to see Aes
Sedai, especially sisters born here. I think they would like to
pretend the Power doesn&rsquo;t exist. Well, their history gives
them reason, and for the last two thousand years they have had the
means to support the pretense. In any event, Cadsuane is Cadsuane.
She seldom sees a swelled head without deciding to deflate it, even
when it happens to be wearing a crown. Or a Counsel&rsquo;s diadem.
Her last visit was over twenty years ago, during the Aiel War, but
I suspect some who remember it will want to hide under their beds
when they learn she is back.&rdquo; Kumira gave a small, amused laugh.
Shalon saw nothing to laugh at. Harine twisted her lips, but it
made her look as though she suffered from a bad belly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wish to see the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;guardian?&rdquo; Kumira went on.
&ldquo;As good a name as any, I suppose. There isn&rsquo;t much to see.&rdquo;
She stepped cautiously closer to the gilded railing and peered over
as if fearing she might fall, but those blue eyes had sharpened
again. &ldquo;I would give anything to study it, but that is impossible,
of course. Who knows what else it might be able to do beside what
we already know?&rdquo; Her tone held as much awe as regret.</p>

<p>Shalon had no fear of heights, and she pressed
herself against the elaborately worked metal beside the Aes Sedai,
wanting to see this thing that had taken the Source away. After a
moment, Harine joined them. To Shalon&rsquo;s surprise, the drop
that made Kumira uneasy was less than twenty feet; below, a smooth
floor tiled in blue and white to make a convoluted maze centered on
a double-pointed red oval rimmed with yellow. Beneath the balcony,
three women in white sat on stools spaced equally around the edge
of the floor, right against the dome&rsquo;s wall, and beside each
woman, a disc a full span across that looked like clouded crystal
had been set into the floor and inlaid with a long thin wedge of
clear crystal that pointed toward the chamber&rsquo;s center. Metal
collars surrounded the murky discs, marked off like a compass but
with ever-smaller markings between the larger. Shalon could not be
sure, but the collar nearest her appeared to be inscribed with
numerals. That was all. No monstrous shapes. She had imagined
something huge and black that sucked in the light. Her hands
tightened on the rail to keep from trembling, and she locked her
knees to hold herself still. Whatever was down there, it <em>
had</em> stolen the Light.</p>

<p>A whisper of slippers announced new arrivals on the
balcony by the same doorway they had used, about a dozen smiling
women with their hair on top of their heads, in flowing blue silk
robes worn over their dresses like sleeveless coats, richly
embroidered in gold and trailing behind them on the floor. These
people knew how to mark out rank. Each woman wore a large pendant
in the shape of that gold-rimmed red oval suspended from a necklace
of heavy golden links, and the same shape was repeated at the front
of each narrow golden diadem. On one woman, the red ovals were made
of rubies, not enamel, and sapphires and moonstones almost hid the
golden circlet on her brows, and she wore a heavy golden signet
ring on her right forefinger. She was tall and stately, her black
hair drawn up in a large ball, heavily winged with white, though
her face was unlined. The others were tall, short, stout, thin,
pretty and plain, none young, and every one of them had an air of
authority about her, but she stood out for more than her gems.
Compassion and wisdom filled her large dark eyes, and it was
command that she radiated, not simple authority. Shalon did not
need to be told that this was the First Counsel, but the woman
announced it anyway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Aleis Barsalla, First Counsel of Far Madding.&rdquo;
Her mellifluous voice, deep for a woman, seemed to be making a
proclamation, and expecting cheers. The sound of her voice bouncing
inside the dome gave something like acclamation. &ldquo;Far Madding gives
welcome to Harine din Togara Two Winds, Wavemistress of Clan
Shodein and Ambassador Extraordinary for the Mistress of the Ships
to the Atha&rsquo;an Miere. May the Light illumine you and see you
prosper. Your coming gladdens every heart in Far Madding. I embrace
the chance to learn more of the Atha&rsquo;an Miere, but you must be
weary from the rigors of your journey. I have arranged pleasant
quarters for you in my palace. When you have rested and eaten, we
can talk; to our mutual advantage, if it pleases the Light.&rdquo; The
others spread the skirts of their robes and made half bows.</p>

<p>Harine inclined her head slightly, a hint of
satisfaction in her smile. Here, at last, were those who showed her
proper respect. And very likely it helped that they did not gape at
her and Shalon&rsquo;s jewelry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The messengers from the gates are as quick as ever,
it seems, Aleis,&rdquo; Cadsuane said. &ldquo;Is there no welcome for me?&rdquo;
Aleis&rsquo; smile thinned for a moment, and some of the other
smiles faded altogether as Cadsuane moved to stand beside Harine.
Those that remained were forced. A pretty woman with a serious cast
to her face went so far as to scowl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are grateful to you for bringing the Wavemistress
here, Cadsuane Sedai.&rdquo; The First Counsel did not sound particularly
grateful. She drew herself up to her full height and looked
straight ahead, over Cadsuane&rsquo;s head rather than at her. &ldquo;I am
sure we can find some way to make the depth of our gratitude known
before you leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She could not have made her dismissal plainer short
of a command, but the Aes Sedai smiled up at the taller woman. It
was not an unpleasant smile, exactly, but neither was it in the
least amused. &ldquo;I may not be leaving for a while, Aleis. I thank you
for the offer of accommodations, and accept. A palace on the
Heights is always preferable to even the best inn.&rdquo; The First
Counsel&rsquo;s eyes widened with startlement, then narrowed in
determination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cadsuane must stay with me,&rdquo; Harine said, managing
to sound no more than half strangled, before Aleis could speak.
&ldquo;Where she is unwelcome, so am I.&rdquo; This had been part of the
bargain forced on her, if they were to accompany Cadsuane. Among
other things they must go when and where she said until they joined
the Coramoor, and include her in any invitations they received.
That last had seemed very small at the time, especially weighed
against the rest, but plainly the woman had known exactly the
reception she would receive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No need to be disheartened, Aleis.&rdquo; Cadsuane leaned
toward the First Counsel confidingly, but she did not lower her
voice. The reverberations in the dome magnified her words.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you no longer have any bad habits for me to
correct.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The First Counsel&rsquo;s face flooded with crimson,
and behind her back, speculative frowns passed between the other
Counsels. Some contemplated her as if with fresh eyes. How did they
attain rank, and how lose it? Besides Aleis, they were twelve,
surely a coincidence, but the First Twelve among a clan&rsquo;s
Sailmistresses chose the Wavemistress, usually one of their own
number, just as the First Twelve among the Wavemistresses chose the
Mistress of the Ships. That was why Harine had accepted that
strange girl&rsquo;s words, because she was of the First Twelve.
That, and the fact that two Aes Sedai said the girl saw true
visions. A Wavemistress or even the Mistress of the Ships could be
deposed, though only for specified causes, such as gross
incompetence or losing her wits, and the First Twelve had to speak
with a unanimous voice. Things seemed to be done differently among
the shorebound, and often sloppily. Aleis&rsquo; eyes, fixed now on
Cadsuane, were both hate-filled and hunted. Perhaps she could feel
twelve sets of eyes on her back. The other Counsels had her on the
scales. But if Cadsuane had chosen to meddle in the politics of
this place, why? And why so bluntly?</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man just channeled,&rdquo; Verin said suddenly. She had
not joined the rest and was peering over the rail, ten paces away.
The dome made her voice carry. &ldquo;Do you have many men channeling
lately, First Counsel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shalon looked down, and blinked. The formerly clear
wedges were now black, and rather than pointing toward the
chamber&rsquo;s heart, somehow they had turned in roughly the same
direction. One of the women below was on her feet, bending over to
study where along the marked collar the thin black wedge was
pointing, and the other two women were already racing toward a
round-topped doorway. Suddenly, Shalon knew. Triangulation was a
simple matter to any Windfinder. Somewhere beyond that door way was
a chart, and soon the position where the man had channeled would be
marked on it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be red for a woman, not black,&rdquo; Kumira said
in almost a whisper. She still stood a little back from the rail,
but she was gripping it with both hands and leaning forward to peer
at the scene below. &ldquo;It warns and locates and defends. And what
else? The women who made it would have wanted more, perhaps needed
more. Not knowing what else could be incredibly dangerous.&rdquo; She did
not sound frightened, though. She sounded excited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An Asha&rsquo;man, I expect,&rdquo; Aleis said calmly,
pulling her gaze from Cadsuane. &ldquo;They cannot trouble us. They are
free to enter the city, so long as they obey the law.&rdquo; However calm
she was, some of the women behind her tittered like new deckgirls
their first time among the shorebound. &ldquo;Forgive me, Aes Sedai. Far
Madding gives you welcome. I am afraid I don&rsquo;t know your name,
though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verin was still gazing down at the dome&rsquo;s floor.
Shalon glanced over the rail again, and blinked as the thin black
wedges&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;changed. One moment they were black and pointing
north, the next clear and once again pointing to the center of the
maze. They did not turn; they just were one thing, then the
other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All of you may call me Eadwina,&rdquo; Verin said. Shalon
barely suppressed a start. Kumira did not so much as blink. &ldquo;Do you
consider history, First Counsel?&rdquo; Verin continued without looking
up. &ldquo;Guaire Amalasan&rsquo;s siege of Far Madding lasted just three
weeks. A savage business, at the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt they want to hear about <em>him</em>,&rdquo;
Cadsuane said sharply, and indeed, for some reason more than one of
the Counsels looked uncomfortable. Who in the Light was this Guaire
Amalasan? The name sounded vaguely familiar, but Shalon could not
place it. Some shorebound conqueror, obviously.</p>

<p>Aleis glanced at Cadsuane, and her mouth tightened.
&ldquo;History records Guaire Amalasan as a remarkable general, Eadwina
Sedai, perhaps second only to Artur Hawkwing himself. What brings
him to mind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shalon had never seen one of the Aes Sedai traveling
with Cadsuane fail to heed her most casual warning as quickly as
they obeyed her commands, but Verin paid no heed this time. She did
not look up. &ldquo;I was just thinking that he couldn&rsquo;t use the
Power, yet he crushed Far Madding like an overripe plum.&rdquo; The stout
little Aes Sedai paused as though something had just occurred to
her. &ldquo;You know, the Dragon Reborn has armies in Illian and Tear, in
Andor and Cairhien. Not to mention many tens of thousands of Aiel.
Very fierce, the Aiel. I wonder you can be so complacent about his
Asha&rsquo;man scouting you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you have frightened them quite enough,&rdquo;
Cadsuane said firmly.</p>

<p>Verin finally turned from the gilded rail, her eyes
open very wide, a round, startled shorebird. Her plump hands even
fluttered like wings. &ldquo;Oh. I didn&rsquo;t mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Oh, no. I would
think the Dragon Reborn would have moved against you already if he
intended to. No, I suspect the Seanchan&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;You&rsquo;ve heard of
them? What we hear from Altara and farther west is really quite
horrible. They seem to sweep everything before them. No, I suspect
they&rsquo;re somewhat more important to his plans than capturing
Far Madding. Unless you do something to anger him, of course, or
upset his followers. But I am sure you are too intelligent to do
that.&rdquo; She looked very innocent. There was a stir among the
Counsels, the ripple that small fish made on the surface when a
lionfish swam below.</p>

<p>Cadsuane sighed, her patience clearly at an end. &ldquo;If
you want to discuss the Dragon Reborn, Eadwina, you must do so
without me. I want to wash my face and have some hot tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The First Counsel jerked as though she had forgotten
Cadsuane&rsquo;s existence, incredible as that seemed. &ldquo;Yes. Yes, of
course. Cumere, Narvais, would you please escort the Wavemistress
and Cadsuane Sedai to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to my palace and make them welcome?&rdquo;
That slight hitch was the only sign she gave of discomfort at
having Cadsuane in her dwelling &ldquo;I wish to have some further talk
with Eadwina Sedai, if it pleases her.&rdquo; Followed by most of the
Counsels, Aleis glided away along the balcony. Verin looked
suddenly alarmed and uncertain as they gathered her up and swept
her along. Shalon did not believe the surprise or unease any more
than she had the earlier innocence. She thought she knew now where
Jahar was. She just did not know why.</p>

<p>The women Aleis had named, the pretty one who had
scowled at Cadsuane, and a slim gray-haired woman, took the First
Counsel&rsquo;s request as a command, which perhaps it was. They
spread their robes and made those half bows, asking Harine whether
she would be pleased to accompany them and announcing in flowery
terms their pleasure at escorting her. Harine listened with a sour
face. They could strew baskets of rose petals in her path if they
wished, but the First Counsel had left her to underlings. Shalon
wondered whether there was any way to avoid her sister until her
temper cooled.</p>

<p>Cadsuane did not watch Verin leave with Aleis, not
openly, but her mouth curved in a faint smile when they vanished
through the next arched doorway along the balcony. &ldquo;Cumere and
Narvais,&rdquo; she said abruptly. &ldquo;That would be Cumere Powys and
Narvais Maslin? I have heard things about you.&rdquo; That jerked their
attention away from Harine. &ldquo;There are standards any Counsel should
meet,&rdquo; Cadsuane went on in a firm tone, taking them each by a
sleeve and turning them toward the stairs on either side of her.
Exchanging worried glances, they let her, Harine apparently quite
forgotten. At the doorway, Cadsuane paused to look back, but not at
Harine or Shalon. &ldquo;Kumira? Kumira!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other Aes Sedai gave a start, and with a last
lingering look over the railing, pulled herself away to follow
Cadsuane. Which left Harine and Shalon no option except to follow,
too, or be left to try finding their own way out. Shalon darted
after the others, and Harine was no less quick. Still gripping the
Counsels to her sides, Cadsuane led the way down the curling
stairs, talking in a low voice. With Kumira between her and the
three, Shalon could hear nothing. Cumere and Narvais tried to
speak, but Cadsuane allowed neither more than a few words before
she began again. She seemed calm, matter-of-fact. The pair with her
began to look anxious. What in the Light was Cadsuane up to?</p>

<p>&ldquo;This place troubles you?&rdquo; Harine said suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is as if I have lost my eyes.&rdquo; Shalon shivered at
the truth of that. &ldquo;I am afraid, Wavemistress, but the Light
willing, I can control my fear.&rdquo; Light, she hoped she could. She
desperately needed to.</p>

<p>Harine nodded, frowning at the women ahead of them
down the stairs. &ldquo;I do not know whether Aleis&rsquo; palace has a
tub big enough for us to bathe together, and I doubt they know
honeyed wine, but we will find something.&rdquo; Glancing away from
Cadsuane and the others, she touched Shalon&rsquo;s arm awkwardly.
&ldquo;I was afraid of the dark when I was a child, and you never left me
alone till the fear passed. I will not leave you alone, either,
Shalon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shalon missed a step and barely caught herself short
of tumbling down head over heels. Harine had not used her name
except in private since she was first made Sailmistress. She had
not been this friendly in private since before that. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo;
she said, and with an effort, added, &ldquo;Harine.&rdquo; Her sister patted
her arm again, and smiled. Harine was unpracticed at smiling, but
the awkward effort held warmth.</p>

<p>There was no warmth in the look she directed toward
the women ahead, though. &ldquo;Perhaps I truly can make a bargain here.
Cadsuane has already shifted their ballast so they ride with a
list. You must try to find out why, Shalon, when you get close to
her. I would like to put Aleis&rsquo; eyeteeth on a string&mdash;walking away from me without so much as a word!&mdash;but not at
the expense of letting Cadsuane mesh the Coramoor in some trouble
here. You must find out, Shalon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think perhaps Cadsuane meddles the way anyone else
breathes,&rdquo; Shalon replied with a sigh, &ldquo;but I will try, Harine. I
will do my best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You always have, sister. You always will. I know
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shalon sighed again. It was much too soon to test the
