<h4><em>A Lily in Winter</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">A</span>nother
serving man nearly fell on his nose bowing,
and Elayne sighed as she glided past along the Palace corridor. At
least, she tried to glide. The Daughter-Heir of Andor, stately and
serene. She wanted to run, though her dark blue skirts probably
would have tripped her had she tried. She could almost feel the
stout man&rsquo;s goggling eyes following her and her companions. A
minor irritant, and one that would pass; a grain of sand in her
slipper. <em>Rand bloody thinks-he-knows-best-for-everybody
al&rsquo;Thor is itchoak down my back!</em> she thought. If he
managed to get away from her this time&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just remember,&rdquo; she said firmly. &ldquo;He hears nothing
about spies, or forkroot, or any of that!&rdquo; The very last thing she
needed was him deciding to &ldquo;rescue&rdquo; her. Men did that sort of
nonsense; Nynaeve called it &ldquo;thinking with the hair on their
chests.&rdquo; Light, he would probably try to move the Aiel and the
Saldaeans back into the city! Into the Palace itself! Bitter as it
was to admit, she could not stop him if he did, not short of open
war, and even that might not be enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t tell him things he doesn&rsquo;t need to
know,&rdquo; Min said, frowning at a lanky, wide-eyed serving woman whose
curtsy nearly collapsed into a sprawl on the red-brown floor tiles.
Eyeing Min sideways, Elayne remembered her own time wearing
breeches, and wondered whether she might not try again. They were
certainly freer than skirts. Not the heeled boots, though, she
decided judiciously. They made Min almost as tall as Aviendha, but
even Birgitte swayed in those, and with Min&rsquo;s snug breeches
and a coat that barely covered her hips, it looked positively
scandalous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You lie to him?&rdquo; Suspicion larded Aviendha&rsquo;s
tone. Even the way she adjusted her dark shawl on her shoulders
carried disapproval, and she glared past Elayne at Min.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; Min replied sharply, glaring right
back. &ldquo;Not unless it&rsquo;s necessary.&rdquo; Aviendha chuckled, then
looked startled that she had, and put on a stony face.</p>

<p>What was she to do about them? They <em>had</em> to
like one another. They just <em>had</em> to. But the two women had
been staring at each other like strange cats in a small room every
since they met. Oh, they had agreed to everything&mdash;there
really had been no choice, not when none of them could guess when
they would all have the man at hand again&mdash;but she hoped they
did not show one another again how skillfully they handled their
knives. Very casually, not actually implying any threat, but very
open about it, too. On the other hand, Aviendha had been quite
impressed with the number of knives Min carried about her
person.</p>

<p>A gangly young serving man carrying a tray of tall
mantles for the stand lamps bowed as she swept by. Unfortunately,
he was staring so hard that he forgot to pay attention to his
burden. The crash of glass shattering on the floor tiles filled the
corridor.</p>

<p>Elayne sighed again. She did hope everyone became
used to the new order of things soon. She was not the object of all
that gaping, of course, or Aviendha, or even Min, though she
probably drew some. No, it was Caseille and Deni, following close
behind, who were making eyes pop and servants stumble. She had
eight bodyguards, now, and those two had been standing guard at her
door when she woke.</p>

<p>Very likely some of the gaping was just that Elayne
had Guardswomen trailing behind her at all, and almost certainly
that they <em>were</em> women. No one was used to that, yet. But
Birgitte had said she would make them appear ceremonial, and she
had. She must have set every seamstress and milliner in the Palace
working as soon as she left Elayne&rsquo;s rooms the night before.
Each woman wore a bright red hat with a long white plume lying flat
along the wide brim, and a wide red sash edged in snowy lace across
her chest with rampant White Lions marching up it. Their
white-collared crimson coats were silk, and the cut had been
altered a little, so they fit better and hung almost to the knee
above scarlet breeches with a white stripe up the outsides of the
legs. Pale lace hung thickly at their wrists and necks, and their
black boots had been waxed till they shone. They looked quite
dashing, and even placid-eyed Deni swaggered just a little. Elayne
suspected they would be even prouder once the sword belts and
scabbards with gold tooling were ready, and the lacquered helmets
and breastplates. Birgitte was having breastplates made to fit
women, which Elayne suspected had <em>certainly</em> made the
Palace armorer&rsquo;s eyes pop!</p>

<p>At the moment, Birgitte was busy interviewing women
to round out the twenty for the bodyguard. Elayne could feel her
concentrating, with no sign of physical activity, so it must be
that, unless she was reading, or playing stones, and she seldom
took a moment away from her duties for herself. Elayne hoped she
would keep it to just twenty. She hoped Birgitte was busy enough
that she did not notice until too late when she masked the bond. To
think that she had been so worried about Birgitte sensing what she
did not want her to when the solution lay in a simple question to
Vandene. The answer had been a rueful reminder how little she
actually knew about being Aes Sedai, especially the parts other
sisters took for granted. Apparently, every sister who had a Warder
knew how, even those who remained celibate.</p>

<p>It was odd how things came about, sometimes. If not
for the bodyguards, if not for wondering how she could manage to
elude them <em>and</em> Birgitte, she would never have thought to
ask, would never have learned the masking in time for this. Not
that she planned to elude her guards any time soon, but it was best
to be prepared in advance of need. Birgitte certainly was not going
to allow her and Aviendha to wander the city alone, day <em>or</em>
night, not any longer.</p>

<p>Their arrival at Nynaeve&rsquo;s door put thoughts of
Birgitte completely out of her head. Except that she must not mask
the bond until the very last instant. Rand was on the other side of
that door. Rand who sometimes crowded her thoughts until she
wondered whether she was like some fool woman in a story who threw
her head over the wall because of a man. She had always thought
those stories must have been written by men. Only, Rand sometimes
did make her feel witless. At least he did not realize it, thank
the Light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait out here, and admit no one,&rdquo; she commanded the
Guardswomen. She could not afford interruptions or attention now.
With luck, her bodyguard was new enough that no one would even
recognize what their fine uniforms meant. &ldquo;I will only be a few
minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They saluted briskly, an arm across the chest, and
took positions on either side of the door, Caseille stone-faced
with a hand on her sword hilt, Deni taking her long cudgel in both
hands and smiling faintly. Elayne was sure the stocky woman thought
Min had brought her here to meet a secret lover. She suspected
Caseille might, as well. They had hardly been as discreet in front
of the two women as they might have; no one had mentioned his name,
but there had more than enough of &ldquo;he this&rdquo; and &ldquo;he that.&rdquo; At least
neither had tried making an excuse to leave so she could report to
Birgitte. If they were her bodyguard, then they were <em>her</em>
bodyguard, not Birgitte&rsquo;s. Except that they would not keep
Birgitte out if she masked the bond too soon.</p>

<p>And she was dithering, she realized. The man she
dreamed of every night was on the other side of that door, and she
was standing there like a witling. She had waited so long, wanted
so much, and now she was almost afraid. She would not let this go
wrong. With an effort, she gathered herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; Her voice was not as strong as she
could have hoped, but at least it did not tremble. Butterflies the
size of foxes fluttered in her stomach. That had not happened in a
long time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Aviendha said, but she had to swallow
first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; Min said faintly.</p>

<p>They went in without knocking, hurriedly closing the
door behind them.</p>

<p>Nynaeve jumped to her feet, wide-eyed, before they
were well into the sitting room, but Elayne barely noticed her or
Lan, though the sweet smell of the Warder&rsquo;s pipe filled the
room. Rand really was there; it had been hard to believe he would
be. That dreadful disguise Min had described was gone, except for
the shabby clothing and rough gloves, and he was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;beautiful.</p>

<p>He leaped from his chair at the sight of her, too,
but before he was completely upright, he staggered and grabbed the
table with both hands, gagging and heaving with dry retches. Elayne
embraced the Source and took a step toward him, then stopped and
made herself let go of the Power. Her ability with Healing was
tiny, and anyway, Nynaeve had moved as quickly as she, the shine of
<em>saidar</em> suddenly around her, hands raised toward Rand.</p>

<p>He recoiled, waving her away. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing you
can Heal, Nynaeve,&rdquo; he said roughly. &ldquo;In any case, it seems you win
the argument.&rdquo; His face was a rigid mask hiding emotion, but his
eyes seemed to Elayne to be drinking her in. And Aviendha as well.
She was surprised to feel gladdened by that. She had hoped it would
be that way, hoped she could manage for her sister&rsquo;s sake, and
now it took no managing at all. Straightening up was a visible
effort for him, and pulling his gaze away from her and Aviendha,
though he tried to hide both. &ldquo;It is past time to be gone, Min,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s jaw dropped. &ldquo;You think you can just go
without even <em>speaking</em> to me, to us?&rdquo; she managed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men!&rdquo; Min and Aviendha breathed at almost the same
instant, and gave one another startled looks. Hastily they unfolded
their arms. For an instant, despite the disparity in just about
everything about them, they had been almost mirror images of
womanly disgust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The men who tried to kill me in Cairhien would turn
this palace into a slag heap if they knew I was here,&rdquo; Rand said
quietly. &ldquo;Maybe if they just suspected. I suppose Min told you it
was Asha&rsquo;man. Don&rsquo;t trust any of them. Except for three,
maybe. Damer Flinn, Jahar Narishma and Eben Hopwil. You may be
able to trust them. For the rest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He clenched gauntleted
fists at his sides, seemingly unaware. &ldquo;Sometimes a sword turns in
your hand, but I still need a sword. Just stay away from any man in
a black coat. Look, there&rsquo;s no time for talking. It&rsquo;s
best I go quickly.&rdquo; She had been wrong. He was not exactly as she
had dreamed of him. There had been a boyishness about him
sometimes, but it was gone as if burned away. She mourned that for
him. She did not think he did, or could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is right in one thing,&rdquo; Lan said around his
pipestem with the same sort of quiet. Another man who seemed never
to have been a boy. His eyes were blue ice beneath the braided
leather cord that encircled his brows. &ldquo;Anyone near him is in great
danger. Anyone.&rdquo; For some reason, Nynaeve snorted. Then put her
hand on a leather scrip with hard bulges lying on the table and
smiled. Though after a moment her smile faltered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do my first-sister and I fear danger?&rdquo; Aviendha
demanded, planting her fists on her hips. Her shawl slipped from
her shoulders and fell to the floor, but she was so intent that she
seemed unaware of the loss. &ldquo;This man has <em>toh</em> to us, <em>
Aan&rsquo;allein</em>, and we to him. It must be worked out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min spread her hands. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what
anybody&rsquo;s toes have to do with anything, or feet either, but
I&rsquo;m not going anywhere until you talk to them, Rand!&rdquo; She
affected not to notice Aviendha&rsquo;s outraged glare.</p>

<p>Sighing, Rand leaned against a corner of the table
and raked gloved fingers through the dark, reddish curls that hung
to his neck. He seemed to be arguing with himself under his
breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you ended up with the <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em> and <em>damane</em>,&rdquo; he said finally. He did
sound sorry, but not very; he might have been regretting the cold.
&ldquo;Taim was supposed to deliver them to the sisters I thought were
with you. But I suppose anyone can make a mistake like that. Maybe
he thought all those Wisdoms and Wise Women Nynaeve has gathered
were Aes Sedai.&rdquo; His smile was quiet. It did not touch his
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand,&rdquo; Min said in a low, warning tone.</p>

<p>He had the nerve to look at her questioningly, as if
he did not understand. And he went right on. &ldquo;Anyway, you seem to
have enough of them to hold on to a handful of women until you can
turn them over to the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the other sisters, the ones with
Egwene. Things never turn out quite the way you expect, do they?
Who would have thought a few sisters running away from Elaida would
grow into a rebellion against the White Tower? With Egwene as
Amyrlin! And the Band of the Red Hand for her army. I suppose Mat
can stay there awhile.&rdquo; For some reason he blinked and touched his
forehead, then went on in that irritatingly casual tone. &ldquo;Well. A
strange turn of events all around. At this rate, I won&rsquo;t be
surprised if my friends in the Tower work up enough courage to come
out in the open.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arching an eyebrow, Elayne glanced at Nynaeve.
Wisdoms and Wise Women? The Band was Egwene&rsquo;s army, and Mat
was with it? Nynaeve&rsquo;s attempt at wide-eyed innocence made her
look like guilt nailed to a door. Elayne supposed it did not
matter. He would learn the truth soon enough, if he could be talked
into going to Egwene. In any case, she had more important matters
to take up with him. The man was babbling, however offhand he
managed to sound, tossing out anything they might snap at in hopes
of diverting them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do, Rand.&rdquo; Elayne tightened her hands
on her skirts to keep herself from shaking a finger at him. Or a
fist; she was not sure which it would be. The <em>other</em>
sisters? The <em>real</em> Aes Sedai, he had been about to say. How
<em>dare</em> he? And his <em>friends</em> in the Tower! Could he
still believe Alviarin&rsquo;s strange letter? Her voice was cool
and firm and steady, brooking no nonsense. &ldquo;None of that matters a
hair, not now. You and Aviendha and Min and I are what we need to
talk about. And we will. We <em>all</em> will, Rand al&rsquo;Thor,
and you are <em>not</em> leaving the Palace until we do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the longest time, he simply looked at her, his
expression never changing. Then he inhaled audibly, and his face
turned to granite. &ldquo;I love you, Elayne.&rdquo; Without a pause, he went
on, words rushing out of him, water from a burst dam. And his face
a stone wall. &ldquo;I love you, Aviendha. I love you, Min. And not one a
whisker more or less than the other two. I don&rsquo;t just want one
of you, I want all three. So there you have it. I&rsquo;m a lecher.
Now you can walk away and not look back. It&rsquo;s madness, anyway.
I can&rsquo;t afford to love anybody!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand al&rsquo;Thor,&rdquo; Nynaeve shrieked, &ldquo;that is the
most outrageous thing I ever heard out of your mouth! The very idea
of telling <em>three</em> women you love them! You&rsquo;re <em>
worse</em> than a lecher! You apologize right now!&rdquo; Lan had
snatched his pipe from his mouth and was staring at Rand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love you, Rand,&rdquo; Elayne said simply, &ldquo;and although
you haven&rsquo;t asked, I want to marry you.&rdquo; She blushed faintly,
but she intended to be much more forward before very long, so she
supposed this hardly counted. Nynaeve&rsquo;s mouth worked, but no
sound came out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My heart is in your hands, Rand,&rdquo; Aviendha said,
treating his name like something rare and precious. &ldquo;If you make a
bridal wreath for my first-sister and me, I will pick it up.&rdquo; And
she blushed, too, trying to cover it in bending to take her shawl
from the floor and arranging it on her arms. By Aiel customs, she
should never had said any of that. Nynaeve finally got a sound out.
A squeak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t know by this time that I love
you,&rdquo; Min said, &ldquo;then you&rsquo;re blind, deaf and dead!&rdquo; She
certainly did not blush; there was a mischievous light in her dark
eyes, and she seemed ready to laugh. &ldquo;And as for marriage, well,
we&rsquo;ll work that out between the three of us, so there!&rdquo;
Nynaeve took a grip on her braid with both hands and gave it a
steady pull, breathing heavily through her nose. Lan had begun an
intense study of the contents of his pipe&rsquo;s bowl.</p>

<p>Rand examined the three of them as if he had never
seen a woman before and wondered what they were. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all
mad,&rdquo; he said finally. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d marry any of you&mdash;all of
you, the Light help me!&mdash;but it can&rsquo;t be, and you know
it.&rdquo; Nynaeve collapsed into a chair, shaking her head. She muttered
to herself, though all Elayne could understand was something about
the Women&rsquo;s Circle swallowing their tongues.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is something else we need to discuss,&rdquo; Elayne
said. Light, Min and Aviendha could have been looking at a pastry!
With an effort she managed to make her own smile a little less&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;eager. &ldquo;In my rooms, I think. There&rsquo;s no need to bother
Nynaeve and Lan.&rdquo; Or rather, she was afraid that Nynaeve would try
to stop them, if she heard. The woman was very quick to use her
authority when it came to Aes Sedai matters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Rand said slowly. And then, strangely, added,
&ldquo;I said you&rsquo;d won, Nynaeve. I won&rsquo;t leave without seeing
you again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Nynaeve gave a start. &ldquo;Yes. Of course not. I
watched him grow up,&rdquo; she blathered, turning a sickly smile on
Elayne. &ldquo;Almost from the start. Watched his first steps. He
can&rsquo;t go without a good long talk with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne eyed her suspiciously. Light, she sounded for
all the world like an aged nurse. Though Lini had never babbled.
She hoped Lini was alive and well, but she was very much afraid
that neither was true. Why was Nynaeve carrying on in this fashion?
The woman was up to something, and if she was not going to use her
standing to carry it off, it was something even she knew was
wrong.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Rand seemed to waver, as though the air
around him were shimmering with heat, and everything else flew out
of Elayne&rsquo;s head. In an instant, he was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;someone else,
shorter and thicker, coarse and brutish. And so repulsive to look
at that she did not even consider the fact that he was using the
male half of the Power. Greasy black hair hung down onto an
unhealthily pale face dominated by hairy warts, including one on a
bulbous nose above thick slack lips that appeared on the edge of
drooling. He squeezed his eyes shut and swallowed, hands gripping
the arms of his chair, as if he could not stand to see them look at
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are still beautiful, Rand,&rdquo; she said gently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; Min said. &ldquo;That face would make a goat faint!&rdquo;
Well, it would, but she should not have said so.</p>

<p>Aviendha laughed. &ldquo;You have a sense of humor, Min
Farshaw. That face would make a <em>herd</em> of goats faint.&rdquo; Oh,
Light, it <em>would!</em> Elayne swallowed a giggle just in
time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am who I am,&rdquo; Rand said, pushing himself up out of
the chair. &ldquo;You just won&rsquo;t see it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At Deni&rsquo;s first sight of Rand in his disguise,
the smile slid crookedly off the stocky woman&rsquo;s face.
Caseille&rsquo;s mouth dropped open. <em>So much for thoughts of
secret lovers</em>, Elayne thought, laughing to herself in
amusement. She was sure he drew as many stares as the Guardswomen,
shambling along between them with a sullen scowl. Certainly no one
could suspect who he was. The servants in the corridors probably
thought he had been apprehended in some crime. He certainly had the
look. Caseille and Deni kept a hard eye on him as if they thought
so, too.</p>

<p>The Guardswomen came near to arguing when they
realized she intended them to wait outside her apartments while the
three of them took him inside. Suddenly, Rand&rsquo;s disguise did
not seem amusing at all any longer. Caseille&rsquo;s mouth thinned,
and Deni&rsquo;s wide face set in stubborn displeasure. Elayne
almost had to wave her Great Serpent ring beneath their noses
before they took positions beside her door, scowling. She shut the
door softly, cutting off the sight of their frowns, but she wanted
to slam it. Light, the man could have chosen something a <em>
little</em> less unsavory for his disguise.</p>

<p>And as for <em>him</em>, he went straight to the
inlaid table, leaning against it while the air around him shimmered
and he became himself once more. The Dragon&rsquo;s heads on the
backs of his hands glittered metallically, scarlet and gold. &ldquo;I
need a drink,&rdquo; he muttered thickly, catching sight of the
tall-necked silver pitcher on the long side-table against the
wall.</p>

<p>Still not looking at her or Min or Aviendha, he
walked over unsteadily and filled a silver winecup that he
half-drained in one long swallow. That sweet spicy wine had been
left when her breakfast was taken away. It must be cold as ice by
now. She had not been expected to return to her rooms so soon, and
the fire on the hearth had been banked down beneath ashes. But he
made no move she could see to warm the wine by channeling. She
would have seen steam, at least. And why had he walked to the wine,
instead of channeling to bring it to him? That was the sort of
thing he always did, floating winecups and lamps about on flows of
Air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you well, Rand?&rdquo; Elayne asked. &ldquo;I mean, are you
sick?&rdquo; Her stomach tightened at the thought of what sickness it
might be, with him. &ldquo;Nynaeve can&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am as fine as I can be,&rdquo; he said flatly. <em>
Still</em> with his back to them. Emptying the cup, he began to
fill it again. &ldquo;Now what is it you don&rsquo;t want Nynaeve to
hear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s eyebrows shot up, and she exchanged
looks with Aviendha and Min. If <em>he</em> had seen through her
subterfuge, Nynaeve <em>certainly</em> had. Why had she let them
go? And how <em>had</em> he seen through it? Aviendha shook her
head slightly in wonder. Min shook hers, too, but with a grin that
said you just had to expect this sort of thing now and then. Elayne
felt the smallest stab of&mdash;not quite jealousy; jealousy was
out of the question, for them&mdash;just irritation that Min had
had so much time with him and she had not. Well, if he wanted to
play surprises&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We want to bond you our Warder,&rdquo; she said, smoothing
her dress under her as she took a chair. Min sat on the edge of the
table, legs dangling, and Aviendha settled onto the carpet
cross-legged, carefully spreading out her heavy woolen skirts. &ldquo;All
three of us. It is customary to ask, first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spun around, wine sloshing out of his cup, more
pouring from the pitcher before he could bring it upright. With a
muttered oath, he hastily stepped out of the spreading wetness on
the carpet and put the pitcher back on the tray. A large damp spot
decorated the front of his rough coat, and droplets of dark wine
that he tried to brush away with his free hand. Very
satisfactory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You really are mad,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;You know
what&rsquo;s ahead of me. You know what it means for anyone I&rsquo;m
bonded to. Even if I don&rsquo;t go insane, she has to live through
me dying! And what do you mean, all three of you? Min can&rsquo;t
channel. Anyway, Alanna Mosvani got there ahead of you, and she
didn&rsquo;t bother asking. She and Verin were taking some Two
Rivers girls to the White Tower. I&rsquo;ve been bonded to her for
months, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you kept it from me, you woolheaded
sheepherder?&rdquo; Min demanded. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d known&mdash;!&rdquo; She deftly
produced a slim knife from her sleeve, then glared at it and glumly
put it back. That cure would have been as hard on Rand as on
Alanna.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This was against custom,&rdquo; Aviendha said, half
questioning. She shifted on the carpet and fingered her belt
knife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very much so,&rdquo; Elayne replied grimly. That a sister
would do that to <em>any</em> man was disgusting. That Alanna had
done it to <em>Rand</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;! She remembered the dark, fiery
Green with her quicksilver humor and her quicksilver temper.
&ldquo;Alanna has more <em>toh</em> to him than she could repay in a <em>
lifetime</em>! And to us. Even if she doesn&rsquo;t, she will wish I
had just <em>killed</em> her after I lay hands on her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After <em>we</em> lay hands on her,&rdquo; Aviendha said,
nodding for emphasis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So.&rdquo; Rand peered into his wine. &ldquo;You can see
there&rsquo;s no point in this. I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I think I&rsquo;d better go
back to Nynaeve, now. Are you coming, Min?&rdquo; Despite what they had
told him, he sounded as though he did not really believe, as if Min
might abandon him now. He did not sound afraid of it, only
resigned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There <em>is</em> a point,&rdquo; Elayne said insistently.
She leaned toward him, trying by the force of her will to make him
accept what she was saying. &ldquo;One bond doesn&rsquo;t ward you against
another. Sisters don&rsquo;t bond the same man because of <em>
custom</em>, Rand, because they don&rsquo;t want to <em>share</em>
him, not because it can&rsquo;t be done. And it isn&rsquo;t against
Tower law, either.&rdquo; Of course, some customs were strong as law, at
least in the eyes of the sisters. Nynaeve seemed to go on more
every day about upholding Aes Sedai customs and dignity. When she
learned of this, she would probably explode right through the roof.
&ldquo;Well, we <em>do</em> want to share you! We <em>will</em> share
you, if you agree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How easy it was to say that! She had been sure she
could not, once. Until she came to realize that she loved Aviendha
as much as she did him, just in a different way. And Min, too;
another sister, even if they had not adopted one another. She would
stripe Alanna from top to bottom for touching him, given the
chance, but Aviendha and Min were different. They were part of her.
In a way, they <em>were</em> her, and she them.</p>

<p>She softened her tone. &ldquo;I am asking, Rand. <em>
We</em> are asking. Please let us bond you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Min,&rdquo; he murmured, almost accusingly. His eyes on
Min&rsquo;s face were rilled with despair. &ldquo;You knew, didn&rsquo;t
you? You knew if I laid eyes on them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He shook his head,
unable or unwilling to go on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know about the bonding until they told
me less than an hour ago,&rdquo; she said, meeting his gaze with the most
gentle look Elayne had ever seen. &ldquo;But I knew, I hoped, what would
happen if you saw them again. Some things have to be, Rand. They
have to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stared into the winecup, moments seeming to
stretch like hours, and at last set it back on the tray. &ldquo;All
right,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I do not want this,
because I do. The Light burn me for it! But think of the cost.
Think of the price you&rsquo;ll pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne did not need to think of the price. She had
known it from the beginning, had discussed it with Aviendha to make
sure she understand, too. She had explained it to Min. Take what
you want, and pay for it, the old saying went. None of them had to
think about the price; they knew, and they were willing to pay.
There was no time to waste, though. Even now, she did not put it
past him to decide that price was too high. As if that were his
decision to make!</p>

<p>Opening herself to <em>saidar</em>, she linked with
Aviendha, sharing a smile with her. The increased awareness of one
another, the more intimate sharing of emotions and physical
feelings, was always a pleasure with her sister. It was very much
like what they would soon share with Rand. She had worked this out
carefully, studied it from every angle. What she had been able to
learn of the Aiel adoption weaves had been a great help. That
ceremony had been when the idea first came to her.</p>

<p>Carefully she wove Spirit, a flow of over a hundred
threads, every thread placed just so, and laid the weave on
Aviendha sitting on the floor, then did the same to Min on the
table&rsquo;s edge. In a way, they were not two separate weaves at
all. They glowed with a precise similarity, and it seemed that
looking at one, she saw the other as well. These were not the
weaves used in the adoption ceremony, but they used the same
principles. They <em>included</em>; what happened to one meshed in
that weave, happened to all in it. As soon as the weaves were in
place, she passed the lead of the circle of two to Aviendha. The
weaves already made remained, and Aviendha immediately wove
identical weaves around Elayne, and around Min again, blending that
one until it was indistinguishable from Elayne&rsquo;s before
passing control back. They did that very easily now, after a great
deal of practice. Four weaves, or rather, three now, yet they all
seemed the same weave.</p>

<p>Everything was ready. Aviendha was a rock of
confidence as strong as anything Elayne had ever felt from
Birgitte. Min sat gripping the edge of the table, her ankles locked
together; she could not see the flows, but she gave an assured grin
that was only spoiled a little when she licked her lips. Elayne
breathed deeply. To her eyes, they three were surrounded and
connected by a tracery of Spirit that made the finest lace seem
drab. Now if only it worked as she believed it would.</p>

<p>From each of them, she extended the weave in narrow
lines toward Rand, twisting the three lines into one, changing it
into the Warder bond. That, she laid on Rand as softly as if she
were laying a blanket on a baby. The spiderweb of Spirit settled
around him, settled into him. He did not even blink, but it was
done. She let go of <em>saidar</em>. Done.</p>

<p>He stared at them, expressionless, and slowly put his
fingers to his temples.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Light, Rand, the pain,&rdquo; Min murmured in a hurt
voice. &ldquo;I never knew; I never imagined. How can you stand it? There
are pains you don&rsquo;t even seem to know, as if you&rsquo;ve lived
with them so long they&rsquo;re part of you. Those herons on your
hands; you can still feel the branding. Those things on your arms
hurt! And your side. Oh, Light, your side! Why aren&rsquo;t you
crying, Rand? Why aren&rsquo;t you crying?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>,&rdquo; Aviendha
said, laughing, &ldquo;as strong as the Three-fold Land itself!&rdquo; Her face
was proud&mdash;oh, so proud&mdash;but even as she laughed, tears
streamed down her sun-dark cheeks. &ldquo;The veins of gold. Oh, the
veins of gold. You do love me, Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne simply stared at him, felt him in her head.
The pain of wounds and hurts he really had forgotten. The tension
and disbelief; the wonder. His emotions were too rigid, though,
like a knot of hardened pine sap, almost stone. Yet laced through
them, golden veins pulsed and glowed whenever he looked at Min, or
Aviendha. Or her. He <em>did</em> love her. He loved all three of
them. And that made her want to laugh with joy. Other women might
find doubts, but she would always know the truth of his love.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light send you know what you&rsquo;ve done,&rdquo; he
said in a low voice. &ldquo;The Light send you aren&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; The
pine sap grew a trifle harder. He was sure they would be hurt, and
was already steeling himself. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I have to go, now. At least
I&rsquo;ll know you are all well now; I won&rsquo;t have to worry
about you.&rdquo; Suddenly he grinned; he might have looked almost boyish
if it had reached his eyes. &ldquo;Nynaeve will be frantic thinking
I&rsquo;ve slipped away without seeing her. Not that she
doesn&rsquo;t deserve a little flustering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one more thing, Rand,&rdquo; Elayne said, and
stopped to swallow. Light, she had thought <em>this</em> would be
the easy part.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose Aviendha and I have to talk while we can,&rdquo;
Min said hurriedly, springing off the table. &ldquo;Somewhere we can be
alone. If you&rsquo;ll excuse us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha rose from the carpet gracefully, smoothing
her skirts. &ldquo;Yes. Min Farshaw and I must learn about one another.&rdquo;
She eyed Min doubtfully, adjusting her shawl, but they left arm in
arm.</p>

<p>Rand watched them warily, as if he knew their leaving
had been planned. A cornered wolf. But those veins of gold gleamed
in her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is something they have had from you that I
haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Elayne began, and choked, a flush scalding her face.
Blood and ashes! How <em>did</em> other women go about this?
Carefully she considered the bundle of sensations in her head that
was him, and the bundle that was Birgitte. There was still no
change in the second. She imagined wrapping it in a kerchief,
knotting the kerchief snugly, and Birgitte was gone. There was only
Rand. And those shining golden veins. Butterflies the size of <em>
wolfhounds</em> drummed their wings in her middle. Swallowing hard,
she took a long breath. &ldquo;You will have to help me with my buttons,&rdquo;
she said unsteadily. &ldquo;I cannot take this dress off by myself.&rdquo;</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The two Guardswomen stirred when Min came into the
corridor with the Aiel woman, and jerked erect when they realized,
as Min closed the door, that no one else was coming out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her taste <em>can&rsquo;t</em> be <em>that</em> bad,&rdquo;
the blocky, sleepy-eyed one muttered under her breath, hands
tightening on her long cudgel. Min did not think anyone had been
meant to hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too much courage, and too much innocence,&rdquo; the lean,
mannish one growled. &ldquo;The Captain-General warned us about that.&rdquo;
She put a gauntleted hand on the lion-headed doorlatch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go in there now, and she might skin you, too,&rdquo;
Min said blithely. &ldquo;Have you ever seen her in a temper? She could
make a bear weep!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha disengaged her arm from Min&rsquo;s and put a
little distance between them. It was the Guardswomen who received
her scowl, though. &ldquo;You doubt my sister can handle a single man?
She is Aes Sedai, and has the heart of a lion. And you are
oath-sworn to follow her! You follow where she leads, not put your
noses up her sleeve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Guardswomen exchanged a long look. The heavier
woman shrugged. The wiry one grimaced, but she took her hand from
the doorlatch. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m oath-sworn to keep that girl alive,&rdquo; she
said in a hard voice, &ldquo;and I mean to. Now you children go play with
your dolls and let me do my job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min considered producing a knife and performing one
of the flashy finger-rolls Thom Merrilin had taught her. Just to
show them who was a child. The lean woman was not young, but there
was no gray in her hair, and she looked quite strong. And quick.
Min wanted to believe some of the other woman&rsquo;s bulk was fat,
but she did not. She could not see any images or auras around
either, but neither looked in the least afraid to do whatever she
thought needed doing. Well, at least they were leaving Elayne and
Rand alone. Maybe the knife was unnecessary.</p>

<p>From the corner of her eye she caught sight of the
Aiel reluctantly letting a hand fall from her belt knife. If the
woman did not stop mirroring her this way, she was going to start
thinking there was more to this jiggery-pokery with the Power than
she had been told. Then again, it had begun before the
jiggery-pokery. Maybe they just thought alike. A disturbing idea.
Light, all this talk about him marrying all three of them was very
well for talk, but which one was he <em>really</em> going to
marry?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elayne <em>is</em> brave,&rdquo; she told the Guards, &ldquo;as
brave as anybody I&rsquo;ve ever met. And she isn&rsquo;t stupid. If
you start off thinking she is, you&rsquo;ll soon go wrong with her.&rdquo;
They stared down at her from the vantage of an added fifteen or
twenty years, solid, unperturbed and determined. In a moment they
would tell her to run along, again. &ldquo;Well, we can&rsquo;t stand
around here if we&rsquo;re going to talk, can we, Aviendha?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the Aiel woman breathed in a tight voice,
glaring at the Guardswomen. &ldquo;We cannot stand here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Guardswomen took no notice of their going at all.
They had a job to do, and it had nothing to with watching
Elayne&rsquo;s friends. Min hoped they did their job well. <em>She
isn&rsquo;t at</em> all <em>stupid</em>, she thought. <em>She just
lets her courage lead the way, sometimes</em>. She hoped they would
not let Elayne scramble into brambles she could not get out of.</p>

<p>Walking along the hallway, she eyed the Aiel woman
sideways. Aviendha strode along as far from her as she could be and
still remain in the same corridor. Not even glancing in Min&rsquo;s
direction, she pulled a thickly carved ivory bracelet from her belt
pouch and slipped it over her left wrist with a small, satisfied
smile. She had had a fly on her nose from the first, and Min did
not understand why. Aiel were supposed to be used to women sharing
a man. A far cry more than she could say for herself. She just
loved him so badly she was willing to share, and if she must, then
there was no one in the world she would rather share with than
Elayne. With her, it almost wasn&rsquo;t like sharing at all. This
Aiel woman was a stranger, though. Elayne had said it was important
they get to know one another, but how could they it the woman would
not talk to her?</p>

<p>She did not spend much time worrying about Elayne,
though, or Aviendha. What lay in her head was too wondrous. Rand. A
little ball that told her everything about him. She had been sure
the whole thing would fail, for her at least. What would making
love with him be like after this, when she knew <em>
everything</em>! Light! Of course, he would know everything about
her, too. She was <em>definitely</em> uncertain how she felt about
<em>that</em>!</p>

<p>Abruptly she realized that the bundle of emotions and
sensations was no longer the same as at first. There was a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;red roaring&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to it, now, like wildfire raging through a tinder
dry forest. What could&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Light! She stumbled, and just caught
her footing short of tumbling. If she had known this furnace, this
fierce hunger, was inside him, she would have been afraid to let
him touch her! On the other hand&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;It might be nice, knowing
she had sparked such an inferno. She could not wait to see whether
she produced the same effect as&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She stumbled again, and this
time had to catch herself on an ornately carved highchest. Oh,
Light! Elayne! Her <em>face</em> felt like a furnace. This was like
peeking through the bedcurtains!</p>

<p>Hurriedly she tried the trick Elayne had told her
about, imaging that ball of emotions tied up in a kerchief. Nothing
happened. Frantically she tried again, but the raging fire was
still there! She had to stop looking at it, stop feeling it.
Anything to get her attention anywhere but there! Anything! Maybe
if she started talking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She should have drunk that heartleaf tea,&rdquo; she
babbled. She never told what she saw except to those involved, and
only then if they wanted to hear, but she had to say something.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll get with child from this. Two of them; a boy and a
girl; both healthy and strong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She wants his babies,&rdquo; the Aiel woman mumbled. Her
green eyes stared straight ahead; her jaw was tight, and sweat
beaded on her forehead. &ldquo;I will not drink the tea myself if I&mdash;&rdquo; Giving herself a shake, she frowned across the width of
the hall at Min. &ldquo;My sister and the Wise Ones told me about you.
You really see things about people that come true?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I see things, and if I know what they
mean, they happen,&rdquo; Min said. Their voices, raised to reach each
other, carried along the corridor. Red-and-white-liveried servants
turned to stare at them. Min moved to the center of the hallway.
She would meet the other woman halfway, no more. After a moment,
Aviendha joined her.</p>

<p>Min wondered whether to tell her what she had seen
while they were all together. Aviendha would have Rand&rsquo;s
babies, too. Four of them at once! Something was odd about that,
though. The babies would be healthy, but still something odd. And
people often did not like hearing about their futures, even when
they said they wanted to. She wished someone could tell her whether
she <em>herself</em> would&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Walking along in silence, Aviendha wiped sweat from
her face with her fingers and swallowed hard. Min had to swallow,
too. Everything Rand was feeling was in that hall. Everything!</p>

<p>&ldquo;The kerchief trick didn&rsquo;t work for you,
either?&rdquo; she said hoarsely.</p>

<p>Aviendha blinked, and crimson darkened her face. A
moment later, she said, &ldquo;That is better. Thank you. I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;With
him in my head, I forgot.&rdquo; She frowned. &ldquo;It did not work for
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min shook her head miserably. This was indecent! &ldquo;It
helps if I talk, though.&rdquo; She had to make friends with this woman,
somehow, if this whole peculiar business was to have a hope of
working. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for what I said. About toes, I mean. I
know a little of your customs. There&rsquo;s something about that
man that just makes me cheeky. I can&rsquo;t control my tongue. But
don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going let you start hitting me or carving
on me. Maybe I have <em>toh</em>, but we&rsquo;ll have to find some
other way. I could always groom your horse, when we have time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are as proud as my sister,&rdquo; Aviendha muttered,
frowning. What did she mean by that? &ldquo;You have a good sense of
humor, too.&rdquo; She seemed to be talking to herself. &ldquo;You did not make
a fool of yourself about Rand and Elayne the way most wetlander
women would. And you did remind me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; With a sigh, she flipped
her shawl up onto her shoulders. &ldquo;I know where there is some <em>
oosquai</em>. If you are too drunk to think, then&mdash;&rdquo; Staring
down the hallway, she stopped dead. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she growled. &ldquo;Not
yet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Coming toward them was an apparition that made
Min&rsquo;s jaw drop. Consternation pushed Rand beyond awareness.
From comments she had known that the Captain-General of
Elayne&rsquo;s Guards was a woman, and Elayne&rsquo;s Warder to boot,
but nothing else. This woman had a thick, intricate golden braid
pulled over one shoulder of her short, white-collared red coat, and
her voluminous blue trousers were tucked into boots with heels as
high as Min&rsquo;s. Auras danced around her and images flickered,
more than Min had ever seen around anyone, thousands it seemed,
cascading over one another. Elayne&rsquo;s Warder and
Captain-General of the Queen&rsquo;s Guards&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;wobbled&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a
little, as though she had already been into the <em>oosquai</em>.
Servants who caught sight of her decided they had work in another
part of the Palace, leaving the three of them alone in the
corridor. She did not seem to see Min and Aviendha until she almost
walked into them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bloody helped her in this, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she
growled, focusing glassy-looking blue eyes on Aviendha. &ldquo;First, she
flaming vanishes out of my head, and then&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&rdquo; She trembled, and
visibly controlled herself, but even then she was breathing hard.
Her legs did not seem to want to hold her upright. Licking her
lips, she swallowed and went on angrily. &ldquo;Burn her, I can&rsquo;t
concentrate enough to shake it off! You let me tell you, if
she&rsquo;s doing what I think she&rsquo;s doing, I&rsquo;ll kick her
tickle-heart around the bloody Palace, and then I&rsquo;ll flaming
welt her till she can&rsquo;t sit for a <em>month</em>&mdash;and
you alongside her!&mdash;if I have to find <em>forkroot</em> to do
it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My first-sister is a grown woman, Birgitte
Trahelion,&rdquo; Aviendha said truculently. Despite her tone, her
shoulders were hunched, and she did not quite meet the other
woman&rsquo;s stare. &ldquo;You must stop trying to treat us as
children!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When she bloody well behaves like an adult, I bloody
well treat her as one, but she has no right to do <em>this</em>,
not in my flaming head, she doesn&rsquo;t! Not in my&mdash;!&rdquo;
Abruptly, Birgitte&rsquo;s glazed blue eyes bulged. The golden
haired woman&rsquo;s mouth dropped open, and she would have fallen
if Min and Aviendha had not each seized an arm.</p>

<p>Squeezing her eyes shut, she sobbed, just once, and
whimpered, &ldquo;<em>Two</em> months!&rdquo; Shaking free of them, she
straightened and fixed Aviendha with blue eyes clear as water and
hard as ice. &ldquo;Shield her for me, and I&rsquo;ll let you off your
share.&rdquo; Aviendha&rsquo;s sullen, indignant glare just slid off
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Birgitte Silverbow!&rdquo; Min breathed. She
had been sure even before Aviendha said the name. No wonder the
Aiel woman was behaving as if she feared those threats would be
carried out right then and there. Birgitte Silverbow! &ldquo;I
saw you at Falme!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Birgitte gave a start as if goosed, then looked
around hurriedly. Once she realized they were alone, she relaxed. A
little. She eyed Min up and down. &ldquo;Whatever you saw, Silverbow is
dead,&rdquo; she said bluntly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Birgitte Trahelion, now, and
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; Her lips twisted wryly for a moment. &ldquo;The flaming
<em>Lady</em> Birgitte Trahelion, if you flaming please. Kiss a
sheep on Mother&rsquo;s Day if I can do anything about that, I
suppose. And who might you be when you&rsquo;re to home? Do you
always show off your legs like a bloody feather dancer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Min Farshaw,&rdquo; she replied curtly. <em>This</em>
was Birgitte Silverbow, hero of a hundred legends? The woman was
<em>foul</em>-mouthed! And what did she mean, Silverbow was dead?
The woman was standing right in front of her! Besides, those
multitudes of images and auras flashed by too quickly for her to
make out any clearly, but she was certain they indicated more
adventures than a woman could have in one lifetime. Strangely, some
were connected to an ugly man who was older than she, and others to
an ugly man who was much younger, yet somehow Min knew they were
the same man. Legend or no legend, that superior air irritated her
no end. &ldquo;Elayne, Aviendha and I just bonded a Warder,&rdquo; she said
without thinking. &ldquo;And if Elayne is celebrating a little, well, you
better think twice about storming in, or <em>you&rsquo;ll</em> be
the one sitting tender.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was enough to make her aware of Rand again. That
raging furnace was still there, hardly lessened at all, but thank
the Light, he was no longer&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Blood rushed into her cheeks. He
had lain often enough in her arms, catching his breath in the
tangle of their bedding, but this really did seem like peeping!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Him?&rdquo; Birgitte said softly. &ldquo;Mothers&rsquo; milk in a
cup! She could have fallen in love with a cutpurse or a horse
thief, but she had to choose him, more fool her. By what I saw of
him at that place you mentioned, the man&rsquo;s too pretty to be
good for any woman. In any case, she has to stop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have no right!&rdquo; Aviendha insisted in a sulky
voice, and Birgitte took on a look of patience. Stretched patience,
but still patience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She might be proper as a Talmouri maiden except when
it comes to putting her head on the chopping block, but I think
she&rsquo;ll wind up her courage to put him through his paces again,
and even if she does whatever it was she did, she&rsquo;ll forget
and be back in my head. I won&rsquo;t bloody go through that again!&rdquo;
She squared herself, plainly ready to march off and confront
Elayne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think of it as a good joke,&rdquo; Aviendha said
pleadingly. Pleadingly! &ldquo;She has played a good joke on you, that is
all.&rdquo; A curl of Birgitte&rsquo;s lip expressed what she thought of
that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a trick Elayne told me,&rdquo; Min said
hurriedly, catching hold of Birgitte&rsquo;s sleeve. &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t
work for me, but maybe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Unfortunately, once she had explained&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s still there,&rdquo; Birgitte said grimly after
a moment. &ldquo;Step out of my way, Min Farshaw,&rdquo; she said, pulling her
arm free, &ldquo;or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Oosquai</em>!&rdquo; Aviendha voice rose desperately,
and she was actually wringing her hands! &ldquo;I know where there is
<em>oosquai</em>! If you are drunk&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Please, Birgitte!
I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I will pledge myself to obey you, as apprentice to
mistress, but please do not interrupt her! Do not shame her
so!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Oosquai?</em>&rdquo; Birgitte mused, rubbing her jaw.
&ldquo;Is that anything like brandy? Hmm. I think the girl is blushing!
She really is prim most of the time, you know. A joke, you said?&rdquo;
Suddenly she grinned, and spread her arms expansively. &ldquo;Lead me to
this <em>oosquai</em> of yours, Aviendha. I don&rsquo;t know about
you two, but I intend to get drunk enough to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to
take off my clothes and dance on the table. And not a hair
drunker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min did not understand that at all, or why Aviendha
stared at Birgitte and suddenly began laughing about it being &ldquo;a
wonderful joke,&rdquo; but she was sure she knew why Elayne was blushing,
if she actually was. That hard ball of sensations in her head was a
raging wildfire again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could we go find that <em>oosquai</em>, now?&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I want to get drunk as a drowned mouse, and fast!&rdquo;</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">When Elayne woke the next morning, the bedchamber was
icy, a light snow was falling on Caemlyn, and Rand was gone. Except
inside her head. That would do. She smiled, a slow smile. For now,
it would. Stretching languorously beneath the blankets, she
remembered her abandon the night before&mdash;and most of the day
as well! She could hardly believe it had been her!&mdash;and
thought that she should be blushing like the <em>sun</em>! But she
wanted to be abandoned with Rand, and she did not think she would
ever blush again, not for anything connected to him.</p>

<p>Best of all, he had left her a present. On the pillow
beside her when she woke lay a golden lily in full bloom, the dew
fresh on the lush petals. Where he could have gotten such a thing
in the middle of winter she could not begin to imagine. But she
wove a Keeping around it, and set it on a side table where she
would see it every morning when she woke. The weave was
Moghedien&rsquo;s teaching, but it would hold the blossom fresh
forever, the dewdrops never evaporating, a constant reminder of
the man who had given her his heart.</p>

<p>Her morning was taken up with the news that Alivia
had vanished during the night, a serious matter that put the Kin in
a tumult. It was not until Zaida appeared in a taking because
Nynaeve had not come for a lesson with the Atha&rsquo;an Miere that
Elayne learned that Nynaeve and Lan were both gone from the Palace,
too, and no one knew when or how. Not until much later did she
learn that the collection of <em>angreal</em> and <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em> they had carried out of Ebou Dar was missing
the most powerful of the three <em>angreal</em>, and several other
items besides. Some of those, she was sure, were intended for a
woman who expected to be attacked at any moment with the One Power.
Which made the hastily scribbled note Nynaeve had left hidden among
the remainder all the more disturbing.</p>
