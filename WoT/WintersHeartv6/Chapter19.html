<h4><em>Three Women</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
wind was out of the north with the sun not yet
fully above the horizon, which the locals said always meant rain,
and a sky full of clouds certainly threatened as he made his way
across the Mol Hara. The particular men and women in the common
room of The Wandering Woman had changed, there were no <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em> or <em>damane</em> this time, but the place was
still full of Seanchan and pipesmoke, though the musicians had not
yet appeared. Most of the people in the room were breakfasting,
sometimes eyeing the bowls uncertainly as if unsure what they were
being asked to eat&mdash;he felt that way himself about the
strange white porridge Ebou Dari liked for breakfast&mdash;but not
everyone was intent on food. Three men and a woman in those long
embroidered robes were playing cards and smoking pipes at one
table, all with their heads shaved in the fashion of lesser nobles.
The gold coins on their table caught Mat&rsquo;s attention for a
moment; they were playing for high stakes. The largest stacks of
coins sat in front of a tiny black-haired man, as dark as Anath,
who grinned wolfishly at his opponents around the very long stem of
a silver-mounted pipe. Mat had his own gold, though, and his luck
at cards had never been as good as at dice.</p>

<p>Mistress Anan, however, had gone out on some errand
or other while it was still dark, so her daughter Marah said,
leaving Marah herself in charge. A pleasingly plump young woman
with big pretty eyes the same hazel shade as her mother&rsquo;s, she
wore her skirts sewn up to mid-thigh on the left side, something
Mistress Anan would not have allowed when he was staying there.
Marah was not best pleased to see him, frowning as soon as he
approached her. Two men had died by his hand in the inn when he was
staying there; thieves who were trying to split his skull, to be
sure, but that sort of thing did not happen at The Wandering Woman.
She had made it clear she was happy to see the back of him when he
moved out.</p>

<p>Marah was hardly interested in what he wanted now,
either, and he could not really explain. Only Mistress Anan knew
what was hidden in the kitchen, so he devoutly hoped, and he
certainly was not about to bleat out the information in the common
room. So he made up a tale about missing the dishes the cook turned
out, and eyeing that blatantly sewn skirt, he slipped in the
implication that he had missed looking at her even more. He could
not understand why exposing a little more petticoat was scandalous
when every woman in Ebou Dar walked around showing half her bosom,
but if Marah was feeling rakish, maybe a few blandishments might
ease his path. He gave her his very best smile.</p>

<p>Giving him half an ear in return, Marah seized a
passing serving maid, a smoky-eyed cat of a woman he knew well.
&ldquo;Air Captain Yulan&rsquo;s cup is almost empty, Caira,&rdquo; Marah said
angrily. &ldquo;You are supposed to keep it full! If you can&rsquo;t do
your job, girl, there are plenty in Ebou Dar who will!&rdquo; Caira,
several years older than Marah, made her a mocking curtsy. And
scowled at Mat. Before Caira could straighten her knees again,
Marah turned to grab a boy who was walking by carefully balancing a
tray piled with dirty dishes. &ldquo;Stop lollygagging, Ross!&rdquo; she
snapped. &ldquo;There is work to be done. Do it, or I&rsquo;ll take you
out to the stables, and you will not like that, I tell you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marah&rsquo;s youngest brother glared at her. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t wait till spring, when I can work on the boats again,&rdquo;
he muttered sullenly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been in a bad skin ever since
Frielle got married, just because she&rsquo;s younger than you and
you haven&rsquo;t been asked yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She directed a cuff at his head that he easily
eluded, though the stacked cups and plates rattled and nearly fell.
&ldquo;Why not just pin up your petticoats at the fishing docks?&rdquo; he
shouted, darting off before she could slap at him again.</p>

<p>Mat sighed as she finally turned her full attention
to him. Pinning up petticoats was a new one on him, but from
Marah&rsquo;s face, he could guess. Steam should have been jetting
from her ears. &ldquo;If you want to eat, you must come back later. Or
you can wait, if you like. I don&rsquo;t know how long before you
can be served.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her smile was malicious. No one would choose to wait
in that common room. Every seat was taken by a Seanchan, and there
were more Seanchan standing, enough that the aproned maids were
forced to weave their way carefully, holding trays of food and
drink aloft. Caira was filling the dark little man&rsquo;s cup and
offering him the sort of sultry smiles she had once offered Mat. He
did not know why she had soured on him, but he had as many women in
his life as he could handle at the moment. What was an Air Captain,
anyway? He would have to find out. Later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will wait in the kitchen,&rdquo; he told Marah. &ldquo;I want
to tell Enid how much I enjoyed her cooking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She started to protest, but a Seanchan woman raised
her voice demanding wine. Grim-eyed in blue-and-green armor, with a
helmet carrying two plumes under her arm, she wanted her stirrup
cup right then. All of the maids seemed occupied, so Marah grimaced
at him one last time and went scurrying, trying to set her face in
a pleasant smile. And not getting far with it. Holding his walking
staff wide, Mat flourished a bow to her retreating back.</p>

<p>The good smells that had mingled with sweet pipesmoke
in the common room permeated the kitchen, roasting fish, baking
bread, meats sizzling on the spits. The room was hot from the iron
stoves and the ovens and the fire in the long brick fireplace, and
six sweating women and three potboys were dashing about under the
orders of the chief cook. Wearing a snowy white apron as if it were
a tabard of office and wielding a long-handled wooden spoon to
reign over her domain, Enid was the roundest woman Mat had even
seen. He did not think he could have gotten his arms around her had
he wanted to. She recognized him right away, and a sly grin split
her wide olive face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, you found out I was right,&rdquo; she said, pointing
the spoon at him. &ldquo;You squeezed the wrong melon, and it turned out
the melon was a lionfish in disguise and you were just a plump
grunter.&rdquo; Throwing back her head, she cackled with laughter.</p>

<p>Mat forced a grin. Blood and bloody ashes! Everybody
really did know! <em>I have to get out of this bloody city</em>, he
thought grimly, <em>or I&rsquo;ll hear them bloody laughing at me
the rest of my life!</em></p>

<p>Suddenly his fears about the gold began to seem
foolish. The gray floorstone in front of the stoves appeared firmly
in place, no different from any other in the kitchen. You had to
know the trick in order to lift it. Lopin and Nerim would have told
him if so much as a single coin had vanished between their visits.
Mistress Anan likely would have tracked down and skinned the
culprit if anyone tried thieving in her inn. He might as well be on
his way. Maybe Aludra&rsquo;s willpower would be weaker at this
hour. Maybe she would give him breakfast. He had slipped out of the
Palace without waiting to eat.</p>

<p>So as not rouse curiosity about his visit, he did
tell Enid how much he had enjoyed her gilded fish, how it was
better than that served in the Tarasin Palace, without having to
exaggerate even a whisker. Enid was a marvel. The woman positively
beamed, and to his surprise, lifted one out of the oven onto a
platter just for him. Somebody in the common room could just wait,
she told him, setting the platter at the end of the kitchen&rsquo;s
long worktable. A wave of her spoon brought a stout potboy with a
stool.</p>

<p>Looking at the golden-crusted flatfish, he felt his
mouth watering. Aludra likely would be no weaker now than any other
time. And if she was upset over being disturbed so early, she might
not give him breakfast. His stomach rumbled loudly. Hanging his
cloak on a peg beside the door to the stableyard and propping his
walking staff beneath, he tucked his hat under the stool and turned
back his lace to keep it out of the platter.</p>

<p>By the time Mistress Anan came in through the door to
the stableyard, swinging her cloak off and shaking rain onto the
floor, little remained beyond a tangy taste on his tongue and fine
white bones on the platter. He had learned to enjoy a number of odd
things since coming to Ebou Dar, but he left the eyes staring up at
him. The things were on the same side of the fish&rsquo;s head!</p>

<p>Another woman slipped in behind Mistress Anan as he
dabbed his mouth with a linen napkin. She closed the door behind
her quickly, and kept her damp cloak on with the hood pulled well
up. Rising, he caught a glimpse of the face inside that hood and
nearly knocked his stool over. He thought he covered well, though,
making a leg to the women, but his head was spinning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is well you are here, my Lord,&rdquo; Mistress Anan
said briskly, handing her cloak to a potboy. &ldquo;I would have sent for
you, otherwise. Enid, clear the kitchen, please, and watch the
door. I need to speak with the young lord alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cook briskly herded the under-cooks and potboys
out into the stableyard, and despite their muttered complaints
about the rain and wails about the food burning, it was clear they
were as accustomed to this as Enid. She herself did not even glance
at Mistress Anan and her companion again before hurrying through
the door into the common room with her long spoon held up like a
sword.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a surprise,&rdquo; Joline Maza said, tossing her hood
back. Her dark woolen dress, with a deep neckline in the local
style, fit loosely and looked worn and frayed. You would never have
thought it from her carefree attitude, though. &ldquo;When Mistress Anan
told me she knew a man who might take me with him when he left Ebou
Dar, I never guessed it was you.&rdquo; Pretty and brown-eyed, she had a
smile almost as warm as Caira&rsquo;s. And an ageless face that
screamed Aes Sedai. With dozens of Seanchan just the other side of
a door guarded by a cook with a spoon.</p>

<p>Removing her cloak, Joline turned to hang it on one
of the pegs, and Mistress Anan made an irritated sound in her
throat. &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t safe yet, Joline,&rdquo; she said, sounding more
as if talking to one of her daughters than to an Aes Sedai. &ldquo;Until
I have you safely&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly a commotion rose at the door to the common
room, Enid protesting in a shout that no one could enter, and a
voice almost as loud, in Seanchan accents, demanding that she move
aside.</p>

<p>Ignoring the protests of his leg, Mat moved faster
than he thought he ever had in his life, grabbing Joline by the
waist and plunking himself down on the bench by the door to the
stableyard with the Aes Sedai on his lap. Hugging her close, he
pretended to be kissing her. It was a fool way to try hiding her
face, but all he could think of short of throwing her cloak over
her head. She gasped indignantly, but fear widened her eyes when
she finally heard the Seanchan voice, and she snaked her arms
around him in a flash. Praying for his luck to hold, he watched the
door open.</p>

<p>Still protesting loudly, Enid backed into the kitchen
thumping away with her spoon at the <em>so&rsquo;jhin</em> with a
wet cloak hanging down his back who was pushing her ahead of him. A
heavy set scowling man with a stub of a braid that did not even
come close to reaching his shoulder, he fended off most of her
blows with his free hand and seemed to ignore the few he could not.
He was the first <em>so&rsquo;jhin</em> Mat had seen with a beard,
and it gave him a lopsided look, running down the right side of his
chin and up the left to stop dead at the middle of his ear. A tall
woman with sharp blue eyes in a pale stern face followed him,
flinging back an elaborately embroidered blue cloak, held at her
throat by a large silver pin shaped like a sword, to reveal a
pleated dress of a paler blue. Her short dark hair was cut in the
bowl, the rest shaved off all the way around above her ears. Still,
she was better than a <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> with a <em>damane</em>.
A little better. Realizing the battle was lost, Enid backed away
from the man, but by the way she gripped her spoon and glared, she
was ready to leap on him again in a heartbeat if Mistress Anan gave
the word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fellow out front did say he did see the innkeeper
going round the back,&rdquo; the <em>so&rsquo;jhin</em> announced. He was
looking at Setalle, but eyeing Enid warily. &ldquo;If you be Setalle
Anan, then know this do be Captain of the Green Lady Egeanin
Tamarath, and she do have an order for rooms signed by the High
Lady Suroth Sabelle Meldarath herself.&rdquo; His tone altered, becoming
less a pronouncement and more the voice of a man wanting
accommodations. &ldquo;Your best rooms, mind, with a good bed, a view of
the square out there, and a fireplace that no does smoke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat gave a start when the man spoke, and Joline,
perhaps thinking someone was coming toward them, moaned against his
mouth in fear. Her eyes shone with unshed tears, and she trembled
in his arms. The Lady Egeanin Tamarath glanced at the bench when
Joline moaned, then grimaced in disgust and turned so she could
avoid seeing the pair. It was the man who intrigued Mat, though.
How in the Light did an Illianer come to be <em>so&rsquo;jhin</em>?
And the fellow looked familiar, somehow. Likely another of those
thousands of long-dead faces he could not help recalling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Setalle Anan, and my best rooms are occupied by
Captain of the Air Lord Abaldar Yulan,&rdquo; Mistress Anan said calmly,
unintimidated by <em>so&rsquo;jhin</em> or Blood. She folded her
arms beneath her breasts. &ldquo;My second-best rooms are occupied by
Banner-General Furyk Karede. Of the Deathwatch Guards. I don&rsquo;t
know whether a Captain of the Green outranks them, but either way,
you will have to sort out for yourselves who stays and who has to
go elsewhere. I have a firm policy of not expelling any Seanchan
guest. So long as he pays his rent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat tensed, waiting for the explosion&mdash;Suroth
would have her flogged for half that!&mdash;but Egeanin smiled.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pleasure to deal with someone who has a little nerve,&rdquo;
she drawled. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll get on just fine, Mistress Anan.
So long as you don&rsquo;t take nerve too far. Captain gives the
orders, and crew obeys, but I never made anyone crawl on my deck.&rdquo;
Mat frowned. Deck. A ship&rsquo;s deck. Why did that tug at
something in his head? Those old memories were a nuisance,
sometimes.</p>

<p>Mistress Anan nodded, never taking her dark eyes from
the Seanchan&rsquo;s blue. &ldquo;As you say, my Lady. But I hope you will
remember that The Wandering Woman is my ship.&rdquo; Luckily for her,
the Seanchan woman had a sense of humor. She laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you be captain of your ship,&rdquo; she chuckled,
&ldquo;and I will be Captain of the Gold.&rdquo; Whatever that meant. With a
sigh, Egeanin shook her head. &ldquo;Light&rsquo;s truth, I don&rsquo;t
outrank many here, I suspect, but Suroth wants me close at hand, so
some move down, and somebody moves out unless they want to double
up.&rdquo; Suddenly she frowned, half glancing toward Mat and Joline, and
her lip curled in distaste. &ldquo;I trust you don&rsquo;t let that sort
of thing go on everywhere, Mistress Anan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I assure you, you will never see the like again
under my roof,&rdquo; the innkeeper replied smoothly.</p>

<p>The <em>so&rsquo;jhin</em> was frowning at Mat and the
woman on his lap, too, and Egeanin had to tug at his coatsleeve
before he gave a start and followed her back into the common room.
Mat grunted contemptuously. The fellow could pretend to be outraged
like his mistress all he wanted; Mat had heard about festivals in
Illian, though, and they were almost as bad as festivals in Ebou
Dar when it came to people running around half-clothed or less. No
better than <em>da&rsquo;covale</em>, or those shea dancers the
soldiers went on about.</p>

<p>He tried to ease Joline from his lap when the door
swung shut behind the pair, but she clung to him and buried her
face on his shoulder, weeping softly. Enid heaved a great sigh and
sagged against the worktable as though her bones had softened. Even
Mistress Anan appeared shaken. She dropped onto the stool Mat had
vacated and put her head in her hands. Only for a moment, though,
and then she was back on her feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Count to fifty and then get everyone in out of the
rain, Enid,&rdquo; she said briskly. No one would have known that she had
been trembling a moment earlier. Gathering Joline&rsquo;s cloak from
its peg, she took a long splinter from a box on the mantelpiece and
bent to light it in the fire beneath the spits. &ldquo;I will be in the
cellar if you need me, but if anyone asks, you don&rsquo;t know
where I am. Until I say otherwise, no one but you or I goes down
there.&rdquo; Enid nodded as though this was nothing out of the ordinary.
&ldquo;Bring her,&rdquo; the innkeeper told Mat, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t dawdle. Carry
her if you must.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did have to carry her. Still weeping almost
soundlessly, Joline would not loosen her hold on him or even lift
her head from his shoulder. She was not heavy, thank the Light, yet
even so, a dull ache began in his leg as he followed Mistress Anan
to the cellar door with his burden. He might have enjoyed it in
spite of the throbbing, if Mistress Anan had not taken her time
about everything.</p>

<p>As though there were no Seanchan within a hundred
miles she lit a lamp on a shelf beside the heavy door and carefully
blew out the splinter before replacing the tall glass mantle, then
laid the smoking splinter on a small tin tray. Unhurriedly
producing a long key from her belt pouch, she undid the iron lock
and, finally, motioned him to go through. The stairs beyond were
wide enough to bring up a barrel, yet steep, vanishing into
darkness. He obeyed, but waited on the second step while she drew
the door shut and re-locked it, waited for her to take the lead
with the lamp held high. The last thing he needed was a tumble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you do this often?&rdquo; he asked, shifting Joline.
She had stopped her crying, but she still held tight to him,
trembling. &ldquo;I mean, hiding Aes Sedai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard whispers there was a sister still in the
city,&rdquo; Mistress Anan replied, &ldquo;and I managed to find her before the
Seanchan did. I couldn&rsquo;t leave a sister to them.&rdquo; She glared
back over her shoulder, daring him to say different. He wanted to,
but he could not make the words come. He supposed he would have
helped anyone get away from the Seanchan, if he could, and he owed
a debt to Joline Maza.</p>

<p>The Wandering Woman was a well-stocked inn, and the
dark cellar was large. Aisles stretched between barrels of wine and
ale stacked on their sides, high, slatted bins of potatoes and
turnips that stood up off the stone floor, rows of tall shelves
holding sacks of dried beans and peas and peppers, mounds of wooden
crates holding the Light alone knew what. There appeared to be
little dust, but the air had the dry smell common to sound
storerooms.</p>

<p>He spotted his clothes, neatly folded on a cleared
shelf&mdash;unless someone else was storing garments down there&mdash;but he had no chance to look at them. Mistress Anan led the
way to the far end of the cellar, where he set Joline down on an
upturned keg. He had to pry her arms free in order to leave her
huddled there. Sniveling, she pulled a handkerchief from her sleeve
and dabbed at red-rimmed eyes. With her face blotchy, she was
hardly the image of an Aes Sedai, never mind her worn dress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her nerve is broken,&rdquo; Mistress Anan said, putting
the lamp on a barrel that also stood on end, the bung in its end
gone. Several other empty barrels stood about the floor where
others had been removed, awaiting return to the brewer. It was as
close to a clear space as he had seen in the cellar. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
been hiding ever since the Seanchan came. The last few days, her
Warders have had to move her several times when Seanchan decided to
search a building instead of just the streets. Enough to break
anyone&rsquo;s nerve, I suppose. I doubt they will try to search
here, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thinking of all those officers upstairs, Mat had to
concede she was probably right. Still, he was glad it was not him
taking the risk. Squatting in front of Joline, he grunted at a stab
of pain up his leg. &ldquo;I will help you if I can,&rdquo; he said. How, he
could not have said, but there was that debt. &ldquo;Just be glad you
were lucky enough to dodge them all this time. Teslyn wasn&rsquo;t
so lucky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Snatching the handkerchief from her eyes, Joline
glared at him. &ldquo;Luck?&rdquo; she spat angrily. If she had been other than
Aes Sedai, he would have said she was sullen, sticking her lower
lip out that way. &ldquo;I could have escaped! It was all confusion the
first day, as I understand. But I was unconscious. Fen and Blaeric
barely managed to carry me out of the Palace before the Seanchan
swarmed over it, and two men carrying a limp woman attracted too
much attention for them to get anywhere near the city gates before
they were secured. I am glad Teslyn was caught! Glad! She gave me
something; I am sure she did! That is why Fen and Blaeric
couldn&rsquo;t wake me, why I have been sleeping in stables and
hiding in alleys, afraid those monsters would find me. It serves
her right!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat blinked at the tirade. He doubted he had ever
heard so much pure venom in a voice before, even in those old
memories. Mistress Anan frowned at Joline, and her hand
twitched.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;ll help you as much as I can,&rdquo; he
said hurriedly, rising so he could move between the two women. He
would not put it past Mistress Anan to slap Joline, Aes Sedai or no
Aes Sedai, and Joline looked in no mood to consider the possibility
of a <em>damane</em> being upstairs to feel whatever she did in
retaliation. It was a simple truth; the Creator made women so men
would not find life too easy. How in the Light was he to get an Aes
Sedai out of Ebou Dar? &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in debt to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A tiny frown wrinkled Joline&rsquo;s brow. &ldquo;In
debt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The note asking me to warn Nynaeve and Elayne,&rdquo; he
said slowly. He licked his lips and added, &ldquo;The one you left on my
pillow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She flicked a hand dismissively, but her eyes,
focused on his face, never blinked. &ldquo;All debts between us are
settled the day you help me get outside the city walls, Master
Cauthon,&rdquo; she said, in tones as regal as a queen on her throne.</p>

<p>Mat swallowed hard. The note had been stuck into his
coat pocket somehow, not left on his pillow. And that meant he was
mistaken about who he owed the debt to.</p>

<p>He made his leave without calling Joline on her lie&mdash;a lie even if only by letting his mistake pass&mdash;and he
left without telling Mistress Anan, either. It was his problem. It
made him feel sick. He wished he had never found out.</p>

<p>Back in the Tarasin Palace, he went straight to
Tylin&rsquo;s apartments and spread his cloak over a chair to dry. A
pounding rain beat against the windows. Putting his hat atop one of
the carved and gilded wardrobes, he toweled his face and hands dry
and considered changing his coat. The rain had soaked through his
cloak in a few places. His coat was damp here and there. Damp.
Light!</p>

<p>Growling in disgust, he wadded up the striped towel
and threw it on the bed. He was delaying, even hoping&mdash;a
little&mdash;that Tylin might walk in and stab the bedpost, so he
could put off what he had to do. What he had to do. Joline had left
him with no choice.</p>

<p>The Palace was laid out simply, if you cared to look
at it that way. Servants lived on the lowest level, where the
kitchens were, and some in the cellars. The next floor up contained
the spacious public rooms and the cramped studies of the clerks,
and the third apartments for less favored guests, most occupied now
by Seanchan Blood. The highest floor held Tylin&rsquo;s apartments,
and rooms for more favored guests, like Suroth and Tuon and a few
others. Except, even palaces had attics, of a sort.</p>

<p>Pausing at the foot of a flight of stairs hidden
around an innocuous corner where they would not be noticed, Mat
drew a deep breath before going up slowly. The huge windowless room
at the top of the stairs, low-ceiling and floored with rough
planks, had been cleared of whatever it held before the Seanchan,
and the space filled with a grid of tiny wooden rooms, each with
its own closed door. Plain iron stand-lamps lit the narrow halls
between. The rain beating down on the roof tiles was loud here,
just overhead. He paused again on the top step, and only breathed
again when he realized that he could hear no footsteps. A woman was
crying in one of the tiny rooms, but no <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> was
going to appear and demand to know what he was doing there. Likely
they would learn he had been, but not until after he found out what
he needed, if he was quick.</p>

<p>He did not know which room was hers, was the trouble.
He walked to the first and opened the door long enough to peek in.
An Atha&rsquo;an Miere woman in a gray dress was sitting on the side
of a narrow bed, hands folded in her lap. The bed and a washstand
with bowl and pitcher and a tiny mirror took up most of the room.
Several gray dresses hung from pegs on the wall. The segmented
silver leash of an <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> ran in an arc from the
silver collar around her neck to a silver bracelet looped over a
hook set in the wall. She could reach any part of the tiny room.
The small holes where her earrings and nose ring had been had not
yet had time to heal. They looked like wounds. When the door
opened, her head came up with a fearful expression that faded into
speculation. And maybe hope.</p>

<p>He closed the door without saying a word. <em>I
can&rsquo;t save all of them</em>, he thought harshly. <em>I
can&rsquo;t!</em> Light, but he hated this.</p>

<p>The next doors revealed identical rooms and three
more Sea Folk women, one of them weeping loudly on her bed, and
then a sleeping yellow-haired woman, all with their <em>
a&rsquo;dam</em> loosely stretched to hooks. He eased that door shut
as though he were trying to filch one of Mistress
al&rsquo;Vere&rsquo;s pies right under her nose. Maybe the
yellow-haired woman was not Seanchan, but he was not about to take
the chance. A dozen doors later, he exhaled heavily in relief and
slipped inside, pulling the door shut behind him.</p>

<p>Teslyn Baradon lay on the bed, her face pillowed on
her hands. Only her dark eyes moved, stabbing at him. She said
nothing, just looked at him as though trying to bore holes in his
skull.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You put a note in my coat pocket,&rdquo; he said softly.
The walls were thin; he could still hear the weeping woman.
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elaida does want those girls as much as she ever
wanted the staff and stole,&rdquo; Teslyn said simply, without moving.
Her voice still had a harshness to it, but less than he recalled.
&ldquo;Especially Elayne. I did wish to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;inconvenience&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Elaida,
if I could. Let her whistle for them.&rdquo; She gave a soft laugh tinged
with bitterness. &ldquo;I did even dose Joline with forkroot, so she
could no interfere with those girls. And look what it did get me.
Joline did escape, and I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Her eyes moved again, to the silver
bracelet hanging on the hook.</p>

<p>Sighing, Mat leaned against the wall beside the
dresses hanging on pegs. She knew what had been in the note, a
warning for Elayne and Nynaeve. Light, but he had hoped she would
not, that someone else had put the bloody thing in his pocket. It
had not done any good, anyway. They both knew Elaida was after
them. The note had changed nothing! The woman had not really been
trying to help them, anyway, just to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;inconvenience&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Elaida. He could walk away with a clean conscience. Blood and
ashes! He should never actually have spoken to her. Now that he had
actually exchanged words with her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to help you escape, if I can,&rdquo; he said
reluctantly.</p>

<p>She remained still on the bed. Neither her expression
nor her tone of voice changed. She might have been explaining
something simple and unimportant. &ldquo;Even if you can remove the
collar, I will no get very far, perhaps no even out of the Palace.
And if I do, no woman who can channel can walk through the city
gates unless she does wear an <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>. I have stood
guard there myself, and I do know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll figure out something,&rdquo; he muttered, raking
his fingers through his hair. Figure out something? What? &ldquo;Light,
you don&rsquo;t even sound as if you want to escape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do be serious,&rdquo; she whispered, so low he nearly
did not hear. &ldquo;I did think you only did come to taunt me.&rdquo; Slowly
she sat, swinging her feet down to the floor. Her eyes latched on
to his intently, and her voice took on a low urgency. &ldquo;Do I <em>
want</em> to escape? When I do something that does please them, the
<em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> do give me sweets. I do find myself <em>
looking forward</em> to those rewards.&rdquo; Breathy horror crept into
her voice. &ldquo;Not for liking of sweets, but because I have pleased
the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>.&rdquo; A single tear trickled from her eye.
She inhaled deeply. &ldquo;If you do help me escape, I will do anything
you ask of me that does not encompass treason to the White&mdash;&rdquo;
Her teeth snapped shut, and she sat up straight, staring right
through him. Abruptly, she nodded to herself. &ldquo;Help me escape, and
I will do <em>anything</em> you ask of me,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do what I can,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;I must think of
a way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She nodded as though he had promised an escape by
nightfall. &ldquo;There do be another sister held prisoner here in the
Palace. Edesina Azzedin. She must come with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One other?&rdquo; Mat said. &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d seen three
or four, counting you. Anyway, I&rsquo;m not sure I can get you out,
much less&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The others do be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;changed.&rdquo; Teslyn&rsquo;s mouth
tightened. &ldquo;Guisin and Mylen&mdash;I did know her as Sheraine
Caminelle, but she do answer only to Mylen, now&mdash;those two
would betray us. Edesina do still be herself. I will no leave her
behind, even if she do be a rebel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, look,&rdquo; Mat said with a smile, soothingly, &ldquo;I
said I will try to get you out, but I can&rsquo;t see any way to get
<em>two</em> of you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It do be best if you go now,&rdquo; she broke in again.
&ldquo;Men are no allowed up here, and in any case, you will rouse
suspicions if you do be found.&rdquo; Frowning at him, she sniffed. &ldquo;It
would help if you did not dress so flamboyantly. Ten drunken
Tinkers could no attract as much attention as you do. Go, now.
Quickly. Go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went, muttering to himself. Just like an Aes
Sedai. Offer to help her, and the next thing you knew, she had you
scaling a sheer cliff in the middle of the night to break fifty
people out of a dungeon by yourself. That had been another man, a
long time dead, but he remembered it, and it fit. Blood and bloody
ashes! He did not know to rescue one Aes Sedai, and she had him
trying to rescue two!</p>

<p>He stalked around the innocuous corner at the foot of
the stairs and almost walked into Tuon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Damane</em> kennels are forbidden to men,&rdquo; she
said, peering up at him coldly through her veil. &ldquo;You could be
punished just for entering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was looking for a Windfinder, High Lady,&rdquo; he said
hastily, making a leg and thinking as fast as he ever had in his
life. &ldquo;She did me a favor once, and I thought she might like
something from the kitchens. Some pastries, or the like. I
didn&rsquo;t see her, though. I suppose she wasn&rsquo;t caught when&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He trailed off, staring. The stern judicial mask the girl
always wore for a face had melted into a smile. She really was
beautiful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is very kind of you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good
to know you are kind to <em>damane</em>. But you must be careful.
There are men who actually take <em>damane</em> to their beds.&rdquo; Her
full mouth twisted in disgust. &ldquo;You would not want anyone to think
you are perverted.&rdquo; That severe expression settled on her face
again. All prisoners would be executed immediately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you for the warning, High Lady,&rdquo; he said, a
little unsteadily. What kind of man wanted to bed a woman who was
on a leash?</p>

<p>He disappeared then, as far as she was concerned. She
just glided away down the hall as if she saw no one. For once,
though, the High Lady Tuon did not concern him at all. He had an
Aes Sedai hiding in the cellar of The Wandering Woman and two
wearing <em>damane</em> leashes who all expected Mat bloody Cauthon
to save their necks. He was sure Teslyn would inform this Edesina
all about it as soon as she was able. Three women who might start
getting impatient if he failed to waft them to safety soon enough.
Women liked to talk, and when they talked enough, they let slip
things better left unspoken. Impatient women talked even more than
the rest. He could not feel the dice in his head, but he could
almost hear a clock ticking. And the hour might be struck by a
headsman&rsquo;s axe. Battles he could plan in his sleep, but those
old memories did not seem much help here. He needed a schemer,
someone used to plotting and crooked ways of thinking. It was time
to make Thom sit down and talk. And Juilin.</p>

<p>Setting out in search of either, he unconsciously
began humming &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Down at the Bottom of the Well.&rdquo; Well, he
was, and night was falling and the rain well and truly coming down.
As often happened, another name drifted up out of those old
memories, a song of the Court of Takedo, in Farashelle, crushed a
thousand years ago and more by Artur Hawkwing. The intervening
years had made remarkably little change in the tune itself, though.
Then, it had been called &ldquo;The Last Stand at Mandenhar.&rdquo; Either way,
it fit too bloody well.</p>
