<h4><em>What a Veil Hides</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span><em>he Victory of Kidron</em> rolled on long sea
swells, making the gilded lamps in the stern cabin swing on their
gimbals, but Tuon sat calmly as the razor in Selucia&rsquo;s sure
hand slid across her scalp. Through the tall stern windows she
could see other greatships crashing through the gray-green swells
in sprays of white, hundreds of them row on row, stretching to the
horizon. Four times as many had been left at Tanchico. The <em>
Rhyagelle</em>, Those Who Come Home. The <em>Corenne</em>, the
Return, had begun.</p>

<p>A soaring albatross seemed to be following the <em>Kidron</em>, an omen of victory indeed, though the bird&rsquo;s long
wings were black instead of white. It must still mean the same
thing. Omens did not change according to location. An owl calling
at dawn meant a death and rain without clouds an unexpected visitor
whether in Imfaral or Noren M&rsquo;Shar.</p>

<p>The morning ritual with her dresser&rsquo;s razor was
soothing, and she needed that today. Last night, she had given a
command in anger. No command should be issued in anger. She felt
almost <em>sei&rsquo;mosiev</em>, as if she had lost honor. Her
balance was disturbed, and that boded as ill for the Return as a
loss of <em>sei&rsquo;taer</em>, albatross or no albatross.</p>

<p>Selucia wiped away the last of the lather with a warm
damp cloth, then used a dry cloth, and finally powdered her smooth
scalp lightly with a brush. When her dresser stepped back, Tuon
rose and let her elaborately embroidered blue silk dressing gown
slide to the gold-and-blue patterned carpet. Instantly the cool air
pebbled her dark bare skin. Four of her ten maids rose gracefully
from where they had been kneeling against the walls, clean-limbed
and comely in their filmy white robes. All had been purchased for
their appearance as much as their skills, and they were very
skilled. They had become used to the motions of the ship during the
long voyage from Seanchan, and they scurried to fetch the garments
that had already been laid out atop the carved chests and bring
them to Selucia. Selucia never allowed the <em>da&rsquo;covale</em>
to actually dress her, not so much as stockings or slippers.</p>

<p>When she settled a pleated gown the color of
well-aged ivory over Tuon&rsquo;s head, the younger woman could not
help comparing the two of them in the tall mirror fastened to the
inner wall. Golden-haired Selucia possessed a stately,
cream-skinned beauty and cool blue eyes. Anyone might have taken
her for one of the Blood, and of high rank, rather than <em>
so&rsquo;jhin</em>, if the left side of her head had not been
shaved. A notion that would have shocked the woman to the quick,
expressed aloud. The very idea of any stepping above her appointed
station horrified Selucia. Tuon knew she herself would never have
such a commanding presence. Her eyes were too large, and a liquid
brown. When she forgot to keep a stern mask, her heart-shaped face
belonged on a mischievous child. The top of her head barely came to
Selucia&rsquo;s eyes, and her dresser was not a tall woman. Tuon
could ride with the best, she excelled at wrestling and the use of
suitable weapons, but she had always had to exercise her mind to
impress. She had trained that tool as hard as she had trained at
every other talent combined. At least the wide, woven belt of gold
emphasized her waist enough that she would not be taken for a boy
in a dress. Men watched when Selucia passed by, and Tuon had
overheard some murmur about her full breasts. Perhaps that had
nothing to do with a commanding presence, but it would have been
nice to possess a little more bosom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light be upon me,&rdquo; Selucia murmured, sounding
amused, as the <em>da&rsquo;covale</em> hurried back to kneel
upright against the walls. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done that every morning
since the first day your head was shaved. Do you still think after
three years that I&rsquo;ll leave a patch of stubble?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tuon realized that she had rubbed a hand across her
bare scalp. Searching for stubble, she admitted to herself
ruefully. &ldquo;If you did,&rdquo; she said with mock severity, &ldquo;I would have
you beaten. A repayment for all the times you used a switch on
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Placing a rope of rubies around Tuon&rsquo;s neck,
Selucia laughed. &ldquo;If you pay me back for all that, I&rsquo;ll never
be able to sit down again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tuon smiled. Selucia&rsquo;s mother had given her to
Tuon for a cradle-gift, to be her nursemaid, and more important,
her shadow, a bodyguard no one knew about. The first twenty-five
years of Selucia&rsquo;s life had been training for those jobs,
training in secret for the second. On Tuon&rsquo;s sixteenth naming
day, when her head was first shaved, she had made the traditional
gifts of her House to Selucia, a small estate for the care she had
shown, a pardon for the chastisements she had given, a sack of one
hundred golden thrones for each time she had needed to punish her
charge. The Blood assembled to watch her presented as an adult for
the first time had been impressed by all those sacks of coin, more
than many of them could have laid hand on themselves. She had been&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;unruly&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;as a child, not to mention headstrong. And the
last traditional gift: the offer for Selucia to choose where she
would be appointed next. Tuon was not sure whether she or the
watching crowd had been more astonished when the dignified woman
turned her back on power and authority, and asked instead to be
Tuon&rsquo;s dresser, her chief maid. And her shadow still, of
course, though that was not made public. She herself had been
delighted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps in small doses, spread over sixteen years,&rdquo;
she said. Catching sight of herself in the mirror, she held her
smile long enough to make sure there was no sting in her words,
then replaced it with sternness. She certainly felt more affection
for the woman who had raised her than for the mother she had seen
only twice a year before becoming an adult, or the brothers and
sisters she had been taught from her first steps to battle for
their mother&rsquo;s favor. Two of them had died in those struggles,
so far, and three had tried to kill her. A sister and a brother had
been made <em>da&rsquo;covale</em> and had their names stricken from
the records as firmly as if it had been discovered they could
channel. Her place was far from secure even now. A single misstep
could see her dead, or worse, stripped and sold on the public
block. Blessings of the Light, when she smiled, she still looked
sixteen! At best!</p>

<p>Chuckling, Selucia turned to take the close-fitting
cap of golden lace from its red-lacquered stand on the dressing
table. The sparse lace would expose most of her shaven scalp, and
mark her with the Raven-and-Roses. Perhaps she was not <em>
sei&rsquo;mosiev</em>, but for the sake of the <em>Corenne</em>, she
had to restore her balance. She could ask Anath, her <em>
Soe&rsquo;feia</em>, to administer a penance, but it was less than
two years since Neferi&rsquo;s unexpected death, and she still was
not entirely comfortable with her replacement. Something told her
she must do this on her own. Perhaps she had seen an omen she had
not recognized consciously. Ants were not likely on a ship, but
several sorts of beetle might be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Selucia,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;A veil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Selucia&rsquo;s mouth tightened in disapproval, but
she replaced the cap on its stand silently. In private, as now, she
had license to free her tongue, yet she knew what could be spoken
and what not. Tuon had only ever had to have her punished twice,
and Light&rsquo;s truth, she had regretted it as much as Selucia.
Wordlessly, her dresser produced a long sheer veil, draping it over
Tuon&rsquo;s head and securing it with a narrow band of golden braid
set with rubies. Even more transparent than the <em>
da&rsquo;covale</em>&rsquo;s robes, the veil did not hide her face at
all. But it hid what was most important.</p>

<p>Laying a long, gold-embroidered blue cape on
Tuon&rsquo;s shoulders, Selucia stepped back and bowed deeply, the
end of her golden braid touching the carpet. The kneeling <em>
da&rsquo;covale</em> bowed their faces to the deck. Privacy was
about to end. Tuon left the cabin alone.</p>

<p>In the second cabin stood six of her <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em>, three to either side, with their charges
kneeling in front of them on the wide, polished planks of the deck.
The <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> straightened when they saw her, proud as
the silver lightning in the red panels on their skirts. The
gray-clad <em>damane</em> knelt erect, full of their own pride.
Except for poor Lidya, who crouched over her knees and tried to
press her tearstained face against the deck. Lanelle, holding the
red-haired <em>damane</em>&rsquo;<em>s</em> leash, scowled down at
her.</p>

<p>Tuon sighed. Lidya had been responsible for her anger
last night. No, she had caused it, but Tuon herself was responsible
for her own emotions. She had commanded the <em>damane</em> to read
her fortune, and she should not have ordered her caned because she
disliked what she heard.</p>

<p>Bending, she cupped Lidya&rsquo;s chin, laying long
red-enameled fingernails against the <em>damane</em>&rsquo;s,
freckled cheek, and drew her up to sit on her heels. Which produced
a wince and a fresh set of tears that Tuon carefully wiped away
with her fingers as she pulled the <em>damane</em> upright on her
knees. &ldquo;Lidya is a good <em>damane</em>, Lanelle,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Paint
her welts with tincture of sorfa and give her lionheart for the
pain until the welts are gone. And until they are gone, she is to
have a sweet custard with every meal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the High Lady commands,&rdquo; Lanelle replied
formally, but she smiled slightly. All the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>
were fond of Lidya, and she had not liked punishing the <em>
damane</em>. &ldquo;If she gets fat, I will take her for runs, High
Lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lidya twisted her head around to kiss Tuon&rsquo;s
palm and murmured, &ldquo;Lidya&rsquo;s mistress is kind. Lidya will not
get fat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Making her way along the two lines, Tuon spoke a few
words to each <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> and petted each of the <em>
damane</em>. The six she had brought with her were her best, and
they beamed at her with a fondness equal to hers for them. They had
competed eagerly to be chosen. Plump, yellow-haired Dali and Dani,
sisters who hardly needed a <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>&rsquo;s direction.
Charral, her hair as gray as her eyes, but still the most agile in
her spinning. Sera, with red ribbons in her tightly curled black
hair, the strongest, and proud as a <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>. Tiny
Mylen, shorter even than Tuon herself. Mylen was Tuon&rsquo;s
special pride among the six.</p>

<p>Many had thought it odd when Tuon tested for <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em> on reaching adulthood, though none could gainsay
her, then. Except her mother, who had allowed it by remaining
silent. Actually becoming a <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> was unthinkable,
of course, but she found as much enjoyment in training <em>
damane</em> as in training horses, and she was as good at one as
the other. Mylen was the proof of that. The pale little <em>
damane</em> had been half-dead with shock and fear, refusing to eat
or drink, when Tuon bought her on the docks at Shon Kifar. The <em>
der&rsquo;sul&rsquo;dam</em> all had despaired, saying she would not
live long, but now Mylen smiled up at Tuon and leaned forward to
kiss her hand before she even reached to stroke the <em>
damane</em>&rsquo;s dark hair. Once skin and bones, she was becoming
a trifle plump. Instead of rebuking her, Catrona, who held her
leash, let a smile crease her usually stern black face and murmured
that Mylen was a perfect <em>damane</em>. It was true, no one would
believe now that once she had called herself Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>Before leaving, Tuon gave a few orders concerning the
<em>damane&rsquo;s</em> diet and exercise. The <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>
knew what to do, just like the other twelve in Tuon&rsquo;s
entourage, or they would not have been in her service, but she
believed no one should be allowed to own <em>damane</em> unless
they took an active interest. She knew the quirks of every one of
hers as well as she knew her own face.</p>

<p>In the outer cabin, the Deathwatch Guards, lining the
walls in armor lacquered blood red and nearly black green,
stiffened at her entrance. That is, they stiffened if statues could
be said to stiffen. Hard-faced men, they and five hundred more like
them had been charged personally with Tuon&rsquo;s safety. Any or
all would die to protect her. They would die if she did. Every man
had volunteered, asked to be in her guard. Seeing the veil,
grizzled Captain Musenge ordered only two to accompany her on deck,
where two dozen Ogier Gardeners in the red-and-green made a line to
either side of the doorway, great black-tasseled axes upright in
front of them and grim eyes watching for any danger even here. They
would not die if she did, but they also had asked to be in her
guard, and she would rest her life in any of those huge hands
without a qualm.</p>

<p>The ribbed sails on the <em>Kidron</em>&rsquo;s three
tall masts were taut with the cold wind that drove the vessel
toward the land that lay ahead, a dark shore near enough that she
could make out hills and headlands. Men and women filled the deck,
all of the Blood on the vessel in their finest silks, ignoring the
wind that whipped their cloaks as they ignored the barefoot men and
women of the ship&rsquo;s crew who darted between them. Some of the
nobles were much too ostentatious about ignoring the crew, as
though they could run the ship while kneeling or bowing every two
paces. Prepared for prostration, the Blood made slight bows
instead, one equal to another, when they saw her veil. Yuril, the
sharp-nosed man everyone thought was her secretary, went to one
knee. He was her secretary, of course, but also her Hand,
commanding her Seekers. The Macura woman flung herself down
prostrate and kissed the deck before a few quiet words from Yuril
made her get back to her feet blushing and smoothing her pleated
red skirts. Tuon had been uncertain about taking her into service,
back in Tanchico, but the woman had pleaded like a <em>
da&rsquo;covale</em>. She hated Aes Sedai in her bones, for some
reason, and despite the rewards already given for her extremely
valuable information, she hoped to do them more injury.</p>

<p>Bowing her head to the Blood, Tuon climbed to the
quarterdeck followed by the two Deathwatch Guards. The wind made
handling her cape difficult, and pressed her veil against her face
one moment, then flailed it over her head the next. It did not
matter; that she wore it was sufficient. Her personal banner, two
golden lions harnessed to an ancient war-cart, flew at the stern
above the six helmsmen struggling to control the long tiller. The
Raven-and-Roses would have been packed away as soon as the first
crewman to see her veil could pass the word. <em>Kidron</em>&rsquo;s
captain, a wide, weathered woman with white hair and the most
incredible green eyes, bowed as Tuon&rsquo;s slipper touched the
quarterdeck then immediately returned her attention to her
ship.</p>

<p>Anath was standing by the railing, in unrelieved
black silk, outwardly undisturbed by the chill wind in spite of her
lack of a cloak or cape. A slender woman, she would have been tall
even for a man. Her charcoal-dark face was beautiful, but her large
black eyes seemed to pierce like awls. Tuon&rsquo;s <em>
Soe&rsquo;feia</em>, her Truthspeaker, named by the Empress, might
she live forever, when Neferi died. A surprise, with Neferi&rsquo;s
Left Hand trained and ready to replace her, but when the Empress
spoke from the Crystal Throne, her word was law. You certainly were
not supposed to be <em>afraid</em> of your <em>Soe&rsquo;feia</em>,
yet Tuon was, a little. Joining the woman, she gripped the railing,
and had to loosen her hands before she broke a lacquered nail. That
would have meant very bad luck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Anath said, the word like a nail driven into
Tuon&rsquo;s skull. The tall woman frowned down at her, and contempt
lay thick in her voice. &ldquo;You hide your face&mdash;in a way&mdash;and now you are just the High Lady Tuon. Except that everyone still
knows who you really are, even if they won&rsquo;t mention it. How
long do you intend carrying on this farce?&rdquo; Anath&rsquo;s full lips
sneered, and she made a curt, dismissive gesture with one slim
hand. &ldquo;I suppose this idiocy is over having the <em>damane</em>
caned. You are a fool to think your eyes are downcast by a little
thing like that. What did she say to make you angry? No one seems
to know, except that you threw a tantrum I am sorry to have
missed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tuon made her hands be still on the railing. They
wanted to tremble. She forced her face to maintain a stern
appearance. &ldquo;I will wear the veil until an omen tells me the time
has come to remove it, Anath,&rdquo; she said, schooling her voice to
calm. Only luck had kept anyone from overhearing Lidya&rsquo;s
cryptic words. Everyone knew that <em>damane</em> could foretell
the future, and if any of the Blood had heard, they would all have
been chattering behind their hands about her fate.</p>

<p>Anath laughed rudely and began telling her again what
a fool she was, in greater detail this time. Much greater detail.
She did not bother to lower her voice. Captain Tehan was staring
straight ahead, but her eyes were almost falling out other lined
face. Tuon listened attentively, though her cheeks grew hotter and
hotter, until she thought her veil might burst into flame.</p>

<p>Many of the Blood called their Voices <em>
Soe&rsquo;feia</em>, but Voices of the Blood were <em>
so&rsquo;jhin</em>, and knew they could be punished if their owners
were displeased by what they said even if they were called <em>
Soe&rsquo;feia</em>. A Speaker of Truth could not be commanded or
coerced or punished in any way. A Truthspeaker was <em>
required</em> to tell the stark truth whether or not you wanted to
hear it, and to make sure that you heard. Those Blood who called
their Voices <em>Soe&rsquo;feia</em> thought that Algwyn, the last
man to sit on the Crystal Throne, almost a thousand years ago, had
been insane because he let his <em>Soe&rsquo;feia</em> live and
continue in her post after she slapped his face before the entire
court. They did not understand the traditions of her family any
more than the goggle-eyed captain did. The Deathwatch Guards&rsquo;
expressions never altered behind the half-concealing cheek-pieces
of their helmets. They understood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, but I do not need a penance,&rdquo; she said
politely when Anath finally ceased her harangue.</p>

<p>Once, after she cursed Neferi for dying by something
as stupid as a fall down stairs, she had asked her new <em>
Soe&rsquo;feia</em> to perform that service for her. Cursing the
dead was enough to make you <em>sei&rsquo;mosiev</em> for months.
The woman had been almost tender about it, in an odd fashion,
though she left her weeping for days, unable to don even a shift.
That was not why she refused the offer, though; a penance must be
severe or it was useless in redressing balance. No, she would not
take the easier way because she had made her decision. And, she had
to admit, because she wanted to resist her <em>
Soe&rsquo;feia</em>&rsquo;s advice. Wanted not to listen to her at
all. As Selucia said, she always had been headstrong. Refusing to
listen to your Truthspeaker was abominable. Perhaps she should
accept after all, to redress that balance. Three long gray
porpoises rose beside the ship and sounded. Three, and they did not
rise again. Hold to your chosen course.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When we are ashore,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the High Lady Suroth
must be commended.&rdquo; Hold to your chosen course. &ldquo;And her ambition
must be looked into. She has done more with the Forerunners than
the Empress, may she live forever, dreamed of, but success on such
a scale often breeds ambitions to match.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peeved at the change of subject, Anath drew herself
up, lips compressing. Her eyes glittered. &ldquo;I am sure Suroth has
only the best interests of the Empire for ambition,&rdquo; she said
curtly.</p>

<p>Tuon nodded. She herself was not sure at all. That
sort of sureness could lead to the Tower of the Ravens even for
her. Perhaps especially for her. &ldquo;I must find a way to make contact
with the Dragon Reborn as soon as possible. He must kneel before
the Crystal Throne before Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don, or all is lost.&rdquo; The
Prophecies of the Dragon said so, clearly.</p>

<p>Anath&rsquo;s mood changed in a flash. Smiling, she
laid a hand on Tuon&rsquo;s shoulder almost possessively. That was
going too far, but she was <em>Soe&rsquo;feia</em>, and the feel of
ownership might have been only in Tuon&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;You must be
careful,&rdquo; Anath purred. &ldquo;You must not let him learn how dangerous
you are to him until it is too late for him to escape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had more advice, but Tuon let it wash over her.
She listened enough to hear, yet it was nothing she had not heard a
hundred times before. Ahead of the ship she could make out the
mouth of a great harbor. Ebou Dar, from where the <em>Corenne</em>
would spread, as it was spreading from Tanchico. The thought gave
her a thrill of pleasure, of accomplishment. Behind her veil, she
was merely the High Lady Tuon, of no higher rank than many others
of the Blood, but in her heart, always, she was Tuon Athaem Kore
Paendrag, Daughter of the Nine Moons, and she had come to reclaim
what had been stolen from her ancestor.</p>
