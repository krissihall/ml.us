<h4><em>Another Plan</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
beam-ceilinged basement of The Wandering Woman
was large, yet it seemed as cramped as the room Thom and Juilin
shared, though it held only five people. The oil lamp set on an
upended barrel cast flickering shadows. Farther away, the basement
was all shadow. The aisle between the shelves and the rough stone
walls was barely wider than a barrel was tall, but that was not
what made it seem crowded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I asked for your help, not a noose around my neck,&rdquo;
Joline said coldly. After near a week in Mistress Anan&rsquo;s care,
eating Enid&rsquo;s cooking, the Aes Sedai no longer looked haggard.
The frayed dress Mat had first seen on her was gone, replaced by
high-necked fine blue wool with a touch of lace at her wrists and
under her chin. In the wavering light, her face half shadowed, she
looked furious, her eyes trying to bore holes through Mat&rsquo;s
face. &ldquo;If anything went awry&mdash;anything!&mdash;I&rsquo;d be
helpless!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was having none of it. Offer to help out of the
goodness of your heart&mdash;well, sort of&mdash;and see what it
got you. He practically shook the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> under her
nose. It wiggled in his hand like a long silver snake, glinting in
the dim lamplight, the collar and bracelet both scraping across the
stone floor, and Joline gathered her dark skirts and stepped back
to avoid being touched. It might have been a viper from the way her
mouth twisted. He wondered whether it would fit her; the collar
seemed larger than her slim neck. &ldquo;Mistress Anan will take it off
as soon as we get you outside the walls,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;You trust
her, don&rsquo;t you? She risked her head to hide you down here.
I&rsquo;m telling you, it is the only way!&rdquo; Joline raised her chin
stubbornly. Mistress Anan muttered angrily under her breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She does not want to wear the thing,&rdquo; Fen said in a
flat voice behind Mat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she doesn&rsquo;t want to wear it, then she
doesn&rsquo;t wear it,&rdquo; Blaeric said in an even flatter, at
Fen&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p>Joline&rsquo;s dark-haired Warders were like peas in a
pod for men so different. Fen, with his dark tilted eyes and a chin
that could chip stone, was a touch shorter than Blaeric, and maybe
a little heavier in the chest and shoulders, yet they could have
worn each other&rsquo;s clothes without much difficulty. Where
Fen&rsquo;s straight black hair hung almost to his shoulders,
blue-eyed Blaeric&rsquo;s very short hair was slightly lighter in
color. Blaeric was Shienaran, and he had shaved his topknot and was
letting his hair grow in to avoid notice, but he did not like it.
Fen, a Saldaean, seemed not to like much except for Joline. They
both liked Joline a lot. The pair of them talked alike, thought
alike, moved alike. They wore dingy shirts and workmen&rsquo;s plain
woolen vests that hung down below their hips, yet anyone who took
them for laborers, even in this poor light, was blind. By day, in
the stables where Mistress Anan had them working&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Light! They
were looking at Mat as lions might look at a goat that had bared
its teeth at them. He moved so he did not have to see the Warders
even from the corner of his eye. The knives hidden about him in
various places were small comfort, with them at his back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will not listen to him, Joline Maza, you will
listen to me.&rdquo; Planting her hands on her hips, Setalle rounded on
the slender Aes Sedai, her hazel eyes glaring. &ldquo;I mean to see you
back in the White Tower if I have to walk every step of the way
pushing you! Perhaps along the way you will show me that you know
what it means to be Aes Sedai. I&rsquo;d settle for a glimpse of a
grown woman. So far, all I have seen is a novice sniveling in her
bed and throwing tantrums!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joline stared at her, those big brown eyes as wide as
they would go, as if she could not believe her ears. Mat was not
sure he believed his, either. Innkeepers did not leap down Aes
Sedai&rsquo;s throats. Fen grunted, and Blaeric muttered something
that sounded uncomplimentary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for you to go farther than
beyond sight of the guards at the gates,&rdquo; Mat told Setalle hastily,
hoping to divert any explosion Joline might be considering. &ldquo;Keep
the hood of your cloak pulled up&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Light, he had to get her
one of those fancy cloaks! Well, if Juilin could steal an
<em>a&rsquo;dam</em>, he could steal a bloody cloak, too. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and the guards will just see another <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>. You can
be back here before daybreak, and no one the wiser. Unless you
insist on wearing your marriage knife.&rdquo; He laughed at his own joke,
but she did not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think I could remain anywhere women are
turned into animals because they can channel?&rdquo; she demanded,
stalking across the floor till she stood toe-to-toe with him. &ldquo;Do
you think I&rsquo;d let my family stay?&rdquo; If her eyes had glared at
Joline, they blazed up at him. Frankly, he had never considered the
question. Certainly he would like to see the <em>damane</em> freed,
but why should it matter this much to her? Plainly, it did, though;
her hand slid along the hilt of the long curved dagger stuck behind
her belt, caressing it. Ebou Dari did not take kindly to insults,
and she was pure Ebou Dari to that extent. &ldquo;I began negotiating the
sale of The Wandering Woman two days after the Seanchan arrived,
when I could see what they are. I should have handed everything
over to Lydel Elonid days ago, but I&rsquo;ve been holding off
because Lydel would not expect to find an Aes Sedai in the
basement. When you are ready to go, I can hand over the keys and go
with you. Lydel is growing impatient,&rdquo; she added significantly over
her shoulder to Joline.</p>

<p>And what about his gold? he wanted to ask
indignantly. Would Lydel have let him take that away, a windfall
under her kitchen floor? Still, it was something else that made him
choke. Suddenly he could see himself saddled with Mistress
Anan&rsquo;s whole family, including the married sons and daughters
with their children, and maybe a few aunts and uncles and cousins,
as well. Dozens of them. Scores, maybe. She might be from off, but
her husband had relations all over the city. Blaeric slapped him on
the back so hard that he staggered.</p>

<p>He showed the fellow his teeth and hoped the
Shienaran would take it for a smile of thanks. Blaeric&rsquo;s
expression never altered. Bloody Warders! Bloody Aes Sedai! Bloody,
bloody innkeepers!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mistress Anan,&rdquo; he said carefully, &ldquo;the way I mean
to get away from Ebou Dar, there&rsquo;s only room for so many.&rdquo; He
had not told her about Luca&rsquo;s show yet. There was a chance he
could not convince the man, after all. And the more people he had
to convince Luca to take, the harder it would be. &ldquo;Come back here
once we&rsquo;re outside the city. If you have to leave, go on one of
your husband&rsquo;s fishing boats. I suggest you wait a few days,
though. Maybe a week or so. Once the Seanchan discover two
<em>damane</em> missing, they&rsquo;ll be all over anything trying
to leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two?&rdquo; Joline put in sharply. &ldquo;Teslyn and who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat winced. He had not meant to let that slip. He had
Joline pegged, and petulant, willful and spoiled were the words
that came most readily to mind. Anything at all that made her think
this more difficult, more likely to fail, might just be enough to
make her decide to try some crackbrained scheme of her own.
Something that would no doubt ruin his own plans. She would be
captured for sure if she tried to run on her own, and she would
fight. And once the Seanchan learned there had been an Aes Sedai in
the city, right under their noses, they would intensify the
searches for <em>marath&rsquo;damane</em> again, increase the street
patrols more than they already had for the &ldquo;mad killer,&rdquo; and worst
of all, they might well make it even harder to pass the gates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Edesina Azzedin,&rdquo; he said reluctantly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know any thing more about her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Edesina,&rdquo; Joline said slowly. A tiny frown creased
her smooth forehead. &ldquo;I heard that she had&mdash;&rdquo; Whatever she
had heard, she snapped her teeth shut on it and fixed him a fierce
stare. &ldquo;Are they holding any other sisters? If Teslyn is getting
free, I won&rsquo;t leave any other sister to them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It took an effort on Mat&rsquo;s part not to gape.
Petulant and spoiled? He was looking at a lioness to match Blaeric
and Fen. &ldquo;Believe me, I won&rsquo;t leave an Aes Sedai in the
kennels unless she wants to stay,&rdquo; he said, making his voice as wry
as he could. The woman was still willful. She might insist on
trying to rescue the other two like Pura. Light, he should never
have let himself get tangled with Aes Sedai, and he did not need
any ancient memories to warn him! His own would do very well, thank
you.</p>

<p>Fen poked him on the back of his left shoulder with a
hard finger. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so light-tongued,&rdquo; the Warder said
warningly.</p>

<p>Blaeric poked him on the back of the other shoulder.
&ldquo;Remember who you are talking to!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joline sniffed at his tone, but she did not probe
further.</p>

<p>Mat felt a knot loosen in the back of his neck, about
where a headsman&rsquo;s axe would strike. Aes Sedai twisted words
with other people; they did not expect others to use their own
tricks on them.</p>

<p>He turned to Setalle. &ldquo;Mistress Anan, you can see
your husband&rsquo;s boats are much better&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might be so,&rdquo; she broke in, &ldquo;except that Jasfer
sailed with all ten of his boats and all of our kin three days ago.
I expect the guilds will want to talk to him if he ever returns. He
isn&rsquo;t supposed to carry passengers. They are coasting to
Illian, where they will wait for me. I don&rsquo;t really intend to
go as far as Tar Valon, you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This time, Mat could not stop a wince. He had
intended falling back on Jasfer Anan&rsquo;s fishing boats if he
failed to persuade Luca. A dangerous option, true, more than
dangerous. Mad, maybe. The <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> on the docks
likely would have wanted to check any order that sent
<em>damane</em> out on fishing boats, especially in the night. But
the boats had always been in the back of his mind. Well, he was
just going to have twist Luca&rsquo;s arm hard, just as hard as
necessary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You let your kin go out in this season?&rdquo; Disbelief
and scorn mingled in Joline&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;When the worst storms
are brewing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her back to the Aes Sedai, Mistress Anan raised her
head proudly, but it was not pride in herself. &ldquo;I trust Jasfer to
sail into the teeth of a cemaros, if need be. I trust him as much
as you do your Warders, Green. More.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frowning suddenly, Joline picked up the lamp by the
iron base and moved it to cast light on the innkeeper&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;Have we met somewhere before? Sometimes, when I cannot see your
face, your voice sounds familiar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instead of answering, Setalle took the
<em>a&rsquo;dam</em> from Mat and fumbled at the flat segmented
bracelet on one end of the round silver leash. The whole thing was
made in segments, fitted together so cunningly you could not see
how it had been done. &ldquo;We might as well get the testing over
with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Testing?&rdquo; he said, and those hazel eyes gave him a
withering look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not every woman can be a <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>. You
should know that by now. I have hopes that I can, but better we
find out before the last hour.&rdquo; Scowling at the stubbornly closed
bracelet, she turned it in her hands. &ldquo;Do you know how to open this
thing? I cannot even find <em>where</em> it opens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said faintly. The only times he had talked
with Seanchan about <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> and <em>damane</em>, it
had been cautious questions about how they were used in battle. He
had never even thought about how <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> were chosen.
He might have to fight them&mdash;those ancient memories hardly
let him stop thinking about how to fight battles&mdash;but he had
certainly never meant to recruit any. &ldquo;Better to test it now.&rdquo;
Instead of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Light!</p>

<p>The catches were a simple matter for him, the
bracelet easiest. That was just a matter of squeezing the right
spots, top and bottom, not quite opposite the leash. It could be
done with one hand, and the bracelet popped open on one with a
metallic click. The collar was a little trickier, and required both
hands. Putting his fingers on the proper spots on either side of
where the leash attached, he pressed, then twisted and pulled while
holding the pressure. Nothing happened, that he could see, until he
twisted the two sides the other way. Then they came apart right
beside the leash, with a sharper click than the bracelet. Simple.
Of course, figuring it out had taken him nearly an hour, back in
the Palace, even with what Juilin had seen to help. Nobody here
praised him, though. Nobody even looked as though he had done
anything they could not!</p>

<p>Snapping the bracelet around her wrist, Setalle
looped the leash in coils on her forearm, then held up the open
collar. Joline stared it with loathing, her hands tightening into
fists gripping her skirts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want to escape?&rdquo; the innkeeper asked
quietly.</p>

<p>After a moment, Joline straightened and lifted her
chin. Setalle closed the collar around the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s neck
with the same crisp snap it had made opening. He must have been
wrong about the size; it fit her quite snugly atop the high neck of
her dress. Joline&rsquo;s mouth twitched, that was all, but Mat
could almost feel Blaeric and Fen tensing behind him. He held his
breath.</p>

<p>Side by side, the two women took a small step,
brushing by Mat, and he began to breathe. Joline frowned
uncertainly. Then they took a second step.</p>

<p>With a cry, the Aes Sedai fell to the floor, writhing
in agony. She could not form words, only increasingly louder moans.
She huddled in on herself, her arms and legs and even her fingers
twitching and crooking at odd angles.</p>

<p>Setalle dropped to her knees as soon as Joline hit
the floor, her hands going to the collar, but she was no quicker
than Blaeric and Fen, though their actions did seem odd. Kneeling,
Blaeric raised a wailing Joline and supported her against his chest
while he began to massage her neck, of all things. Fen worked his
fingers along her arms. The collar came loose, and Setalle fell
back on her heels, but Joline continued to jerk and whimper, and
her Warders continued to work over her as though trying to rub away
cramps. They shot cold stares at Mat as though it were all his
fault.</p>

<p>Looking down on all his fine plans lying in ruins,
Mat barely saw the men. He did not know what to do next, where to
begin. Tylin might be back in two more days, and he was sure he had
to be gone before she returned.</p>

<p>Squeezing past Setalle, he patted her on the
shoulder. &ldquo;Tell her we&rsquo;ll try something else,&rdquo; he muttered.
But what? Obviously it had to be a woman with a
<em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>&rsquo;s abilities to handle the
<em>a&rsquo;dam</em>.</p>

<p>The innkeeper caught him in the dark at the foot of
the stairs leading up to the kitchen while he was gathering his hat
and cloak. A stout, plain wool cloak with no embroidery. A man
could do without embroidery. He certainly did not miss it. And all
that lace! Certainly not!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you have another plan ready?&rdquo; she asked. He could
not make out her face in the dark, but the silver length of the
<em>a&rsquo;dam</em> gleamed even so. She was groping at the
bracelet on her wrist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always have another plan,&rdquo; he lied, undoing the
bracelet for her. &ldquo;At least you can forget about risking your neck.
As soon as I take Joline off your hands, you can go join your
husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She just grunted. He suspected she knew he had no
plan.</p>

<p>He wanted to avoid the common room full of Seanchan,
so he went out through the kitchen into the stableyard and out
through the gate into the Mol Hara. He was not afraid that any of
them would mark him out or wonder why he was there. In his drab
clothes, they seemed to take him for someone running an errand for
the innkeeper when he came in. But there had been three
<em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> among the Seanchan, two with <em>damane</em>.
He was beginning to be afraid he would have to leave Teslyn and
Edesina collared, and he just did not want to look at
<em>damane</em> right then. Blood and bloody ashes, he had only
promised to try!</p>

<p>The weak sun still stood high in the sky, but the sea
wind was picking up, full of salt and a cold promise of rain.
Except for a squad of Deathwatch Guards marching across the square,
humans rather than Ogier, everyone in the Mol Hara was hurrying to
be done with whatever they were about before the rain came. As he
reached the base of Queen Nariene&rsquo;s tall bare-breasted statue,
a hand fell on his shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did no recognize you at first, without your fancy
clothes, Mat Cauthon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat turned to find himself facing the heavyset
Illianer <em>so&rsquo;jhin</em> he had seen the day Joline
reappeared in his life. It was not a pleasant association. The
round-faced fellow did look odd, between that beard and half the
hair on his head missing, and he was shivering in his shirtsleeves,
of all things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know me?&rdquo; Mat said cautiously.</p>

<p>The heavyset man beamed a wide smile at him. &ldquo;Fortune
prick me, I do. You did take a memorable voyage on my ship, once,
with Trollocs and Shadar Logoth at one end and a Myrddraal and
Whitebridge in flames at the other. Bayle Domon, Master Cauthon. Do
you remember me now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember.&rdquo; He did, after a fashion. Most of that
voyage was vague in his head, tattered by the holes those other
men&rsquo;s memories had filled. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to sit down over
hot spiced wine some time and talk over old times.&rdquo; Which would
never happen if he saw Domon first. What remained in his memory of
that voyage was strangely unpleasant, like remembering a deathly
illness. Of course, he had been ill, in a way. Another unpleasant
memory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There be no time like now,&rdquo; Domon laughed, swinging
a thick arm around Mat&rsquo;s shoulders and turning him back toward
The Wandering Woman.</p>

<p>Short of fighting, there seemed to be no way to
escape the man, so Mat went. A knock-down fight was no way to avoid
being noticed. Anyway, he was not sure he would win. Domon looked
fat, but the fat was layered over hard muscle. A drink would not go
amiss in any case. Besides which, hadn&rsquo;t Domon been something
of a smuggler? He might know paths in and out of Ebou Dar that
others did not, and he might reveal them to a little judicious
questioning. Especially over wine. A fat purse of gold lay in
Mat&rsquo;s coat pocket, and he did not mind spending it all to get
the man drunk as a fiddler at Sunday. Drunk men talked.</p>

<p>Domon hustled him through the common room, bowing
left and right to Blood and officers who barely saw him if that,
but he did not enter the kitchens, where Enid might have given them
a bench in the corner. Instead, he took Mat up the railless stairs.
Until he ushered Mat into a room at the back of the inn, Mat
assumed Domon was going to fetch his coat and cloak. A good fire
blazing on the hearth warmed the room, but Mat suddenly felt colder
than he had outside.</p>

<p>Closing the door behind them, Domon planted himself
in front of it with his arms folded across his chest. &ldquo;You do be in
the presence of Captain of the Green Lady Egeanin Tamarath,&rdquo; he
intoned, then added in a more normal tone, &ldquo;This be Mat
Cauthon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat looked from Domon to the tall woman seated
stiffly on a ladder-backed chair. Her pleated dress was pale yellow
today, and she wore a flower-embroidered robe over it, but he
remembered her. Her pale face was hard, and her blue eyes were
every bit as predatory as Tylin&rsquo;s. Only, he suspected Egeanin
was not after kisses. Her hands were slender, but they had
swordsman&rsquo;s calluses. He had no chance to ask what this was
about, and no need.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My <em>so&rsquo;jhin</em> informs me you are not
unfamiliar with danger, Master Cauthon,&rdquo; she said as soon as Domon
finished speaking. Her slow Seanchan drawl still sounded peremptory
and commanding, but then, she was of the Blood. &ldquo;I need such men to
crew a ship, and I will pay well, in gold not silver. If you know
others like yourself, I will hire them. They must be able to hold
their tongues, though. My business is my own. Bayle mentioned two
other names. Thom Merrilin and Juilin Sandar. If either is here in
Ebou Dar, I can use their skills, as well. They know me, and know
they can trust me with their lives. So can you, Master
Cauthon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat sat down on the room&rsquo;s second chair and
threw back his cloak. He was not supposed to sit even with one of
the lesser Blood&mdash;as her dark bowl-cut hair and
green-lacquered little fingernails proclaimed her to be&mdash;but
he needed to think. &ldquo;You have a ship?&rdquo; he asked, in the main to
gain time. She opened her mouth angrily. Asking questions of the
Blood was supposed to be done delicately.</p>

<p>Domon grunted and shook his head, and for a moment
she looked even angrier, but then her stern face smoothed. On the
other hand, her eyes bored into Mat like augers, and she rose to
stand with her feet apart and her hands on her hips, confronting
him. &ldquo;I will have a vessel by the end of spring at latest, as soon
as my gold can be brought from Cantorin,&rdquo; she said in an icy
voice.</p>

<p>Mat sighed. Well, there really had been no chance he
could take Aes Sedai out on a ship owned by a Seanchan, not really.
&ldquo;How do you know Thom and Juilin?&rdquo; Domon could have told her about
Thom, certainly, but, Light, how could she know Juilin?</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ask too many questions,&rdquo; she said firmly,
turning away. &ldquo;I fear I cannot use you after all. Bayle, put him
out.&rdquo; The last was a peremptory command.</p>

<p>Domon did not move from the door. &ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; he
urged her. &ldquo;Soon or late, he must know everything or he will put
you in greater danger than you face now. Tell him.&rdquo; Even for
<em>so&rsquo;jhin</em>, he seemed to get away with a great deal. The
Seanchan were great ones for property keeping its place. For
everyone else keeping theirs, for that matter. Egeanin must not be
a quarter as tough as she looked.</p>

<p>She looked very tough at the moment, kicking her
skirts and striding back and forth, scowling at Domon, at Mat.
Finally, she stopped. &ldquo;I gave them some small aid in Tanchico,&rdquo; she
said. After a moment she added, &ldquo;And two women who were with them,
Elayne Trakand and Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara.&rdquo; Her eyes focused on him
intently, watching to see whether he knew the names.</p>

<p>Mat&rsquo;s chest felt tight. It was not a pain, but
more like watching a horse he had bet on streak toward the finish
line with others close behind and the question still in doubt. What
in the Light had Nynaeve and Elayne been up to in Tanchico that
they had needed a Seanchan&rsquo;s help, and had gotten it? Thom and
Juilin had been closemouthed about the details. That was beside the
point, anyway. Egeanin wanted men who could keep her secrets and
did not mind danger. She herself was in danger. Very little was
dangerous to one of the Blood, except for other Blood and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;The Seekers are after you,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>The way her head came up was confirmation enough, and
her hand went to her side as though reaching for a sword. Domon
shifted his feet and flexed his big hands, his eyes on Mat. Eyes
suddenly harder than Egeanin&rsquo;s. The thick man no longer looked
funny; he looked dangerous. Abruptly it came to Mat that he might
not leave the room alive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you need to get away from the Seekers, I can help
you,&rdquo; he said quickly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to go where the Seanchan
aren&rsquo;t in control. Anywhere they are, the Seekers can find
you. And it&rsquo;s best to go as soon as possible. You can always
get more gold. If the Seekers don&rsquo;t take you first. Thom tells
me they&rsquo;re getting very active about something. Heating the
irons and getting the rack ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a time Egeanin stood motionless, staring at him.
At last, she exchanged a long look with Domon. &ldquo;Perhaps it would be
well to leave as soon as possible,&rdquo; she breathed. Her tone firmed
immediately, though. If there had been worry on her face for a
moment, it vanished. &ldquo;The Seekers will not stop me leaving the
city, I think, but they think they can follow me to something they
want more than they want me. They will follow me, and until I leave
the lands already held by the <em>Rhyagelle</em>, they can call on
soldiers to arrest me, which they will as soon as they decide I am
going to lands not yet gathered. That is when I will need the
skills of your friend Thom Merrilin, Master Cauthon. Between here
and there, I must vanish from the Seekers&rsquo; sight. I may not
have the gold from Cantorin, but I have enough to reward your help
handsomely. You can rest assured of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call me Mat,&rdquo; he said, giving her his very best
smile. Even hard-faced women softened for his best smile. Well, she
did not soften visibly&mdash;if anything, she frowned slightly&mdash;but one thing he did know about women was the effect his
smiles had. &ldquo;I know how to make you vanish now. No use waiting, you
know. The Seekers might decide to arrest you tomorrow.&rdquo; That hit
home. She did not flinch&mdash;he suspected very little made her
flinch&mdash;but she almost nodded. &ldquo;There is just one thing,
Egeanin.&rdquo; This still could blow up in his face like one of
Aludra&rsquo;s fireworks, but he did not hesitate. Sometimes, you
just had to toss the dice. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need any gold, but I do
have need of three <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> who will keep their mouths
shut. Do you think you could supply those?&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a moment that seemed to stretch hours, she
nodded, and he smiled to himself. His horse had crossed first.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">&ldquo;Domon,&rdquo; Thom said in a flat voice around the
pipestem clenched between his teeth. He was lying with a thin
pillow doubled up beneath his head, and he seemed to be studying
the faint blue haze that hung in the air of the windowless room.
The single lamp gave a fitful light. &ldquo;And Egeanin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she is of the Blood, now.&rdquo; Sitting on the edge
of his bed, Juilin peered into the charred bowl of his pipe. &ldquo;I do
not know as I like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you saying we can&rsquo;t trust them?&rdquo; Mat
demanded, tamping down his tabac with a careless thumb. He snatched
his thumb out with a mild oath and stuck it in his mouth to suck
the burn away. Yet again he had the choice of the stool or
standing, but for once he did not mind the stool. Dealing with
Egeanin had taken little enough of the afternoon, but Thom had been
out of the Palace until after dark, while Juilin had taken even
longer to appear. Neither appeared nearly as pleased with
Mat&rsquo;s news as he expected. Thom had just sighed that he had
finally gotten a good look at one of the accepted seals, but Juilin
glowered whenever he looked at the bundle lying in the corner of
the room where he had hurled it. There was no bloody need for the
man to carry on so just because they no longer needed the
<em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> dresses. &ldquo;I tell you, they&rsquo;re both
scared spitless over the Seekers,&rdquo; Mat went on when his thumb was
cooled. Maybe not exactly spitless, but frightened nonetheless.
&ldquo;Egeanin may be Blood, but she never twitched an eyelid when I told
her what I wanted <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> for. She just said she knew
three who would do what we need, and she could have them ready
tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An honorable woman, Egeanin,&rdquo; Thom mused. Every so
often he paused to blow a smoke ring. &ldquo;Odd, true, but then, she is
Seanchan. I think even Nynaeve came to like her, and I know Elayne
did. And she liked them. Even if they were Aes Sedai, as she
believed. She was very useful in Tanchico. Very useful. More than
merely competent. I truly would like to know how she came be raised
to the Blood, but yes, I believe we can trust Egeanin. And Domon.
An interesting man, Domon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A smuggler,&rdquo; Juilin muttered disparagingly. &ldquo;And now
he <em>belongs</em> to her. <em>So&rsquo;jhin</em> are more than
just property, you know. There are <em>so&rsquo;jhin</em> who tell
Blood what to do.&rdquo; Thom raised a shaggy eyebrow at him. Just that,
but after a moment, the thief-catcher shrugged. &ldquo;I suppose Domon is
trustworthy,&rdquo; he said reluctantly. &ldquo;For a smuggler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat snorted. Maybe they were jealous. Well, he was
<em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, and they had to live with it. &ldquo;Then
tomorrow night, we leave. The only change in the plan is that we
have three real <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> and one of the Blood to get
us through the gates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And these <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> are going to take
three Aes Sedai out of the city, let them go, and never think of
raising an alarm,&rdquo; Juilin muttered. &ldquo;Once, while Rand al&rsquo;Thor
was in Tear, I saw a tossed coin land on its edge five times in a
row. We finally walked away and left it standing there on the
table. I suppose anything can happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Either you trust them or you don&rsquo;t, Juilin,&rdquo;
Mat growled. The thief-catcher glared at the bundled dresses in the
corner, and Mat shook his head. &ldquo;What did they do to help you in
Tanchico, Thom? Blood and ashes, don&rsquo;t the two of you go all
flat-eyed on me again! You know, and they know, and I might as
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve said not to tell <em>anyone</em>,&rdquo; Juilin
said as if that really mattered. &ldquo;Elayne said not to. We promised.
You might say we swore an oath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom shook his head on the pillow. &ldquo;Circumstances
alter cases, Juilin. And in any case, it wasn&rsquo;t an oath.&rdquo; He
blew three perfect smoke rings, one inside the other. &ldquo;They helped
us acquire and dispose of a sort of male <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>, Mat.
The Black Ajah apparently wanted to use it on Rand. You can see why
Nynaeve and Elayne wanted it kept quiet. If word spread that such a
thing ever existed, the Light knows what kind of tales would spring
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who cares what stories people tell?&rdquo; A male
<em>a&rsquo;dam</em>? Light, if the Black Ajah had gotten that onto
Rand&rsquo;s neck, or the Seanchan had&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Those colors whirled
through his head again, and he made himself stop thinking about
Rand. &ldquo;Gossip isn&rsquo;t going to hurt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;anybody.&rdquo; No colors
that time. He could avoid it as long as he did not think about&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The colors swirled again, and he ground his teeth on his
pipestem.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not true, Mat. Stories have power. Gleemen&rsquo;s
tales, and bards&rsquo; epics, and rumors in the street alike. They
stir passions, and change the way men see the world. Today, I heard
a man say that Rand had sworn fealty to Elaida, that he was in the
White Tower. The fellow believed it, Mat. What if, say, enough
Tairens begin to believe? Tairens dislike Aes Sedai. Correct,
Juilin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some do,&rdquo; Juilin allowed, then added as though Thom
had dragged it from him, &ldquo;Most do. But not many of us have met Aes
Sedai, not to know it. They way the law was, forbidding channeling,
few Aes Sedai came to Tear, and they very seldom advertised who
they were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s beside the point, my fine Aes
Sedai-loving Tairen friend. And it gives weight to my argument in
any event. Tear holds to Rand, the nobles do at least, because
they&rsquo;re afraid if they do not, he&rsquo;ll come back, but if
they believe the Tower holds him, then maybe he can&rsquo;t come
back. If they believe he&rsquo;s a tool of the Tower, it is just one
more reason for them to turn on him. Let enough Tairens believe
those two things, and he might as well have left Tear as soon as he
drew <em>Callandor</em>. That is just the one rumor, and just Tear,
but it could do as much harm in Cairhien, or Illian, or anywhere. I
don&rsquo;t know what sort of tales might spring from a male
<em>a&rsquo;dam</em>, in a world with the Dragon Reborn, and
Asha&rsquo;man, but I&rsquo;m too old to want to find out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat understood, in a manner of speaking. A man always
tried to make whoever was commanding the troops against him believe
that he was doing something other than what he was, that he was
going where he had no intention of going, and the enemy tried to do
the same to him, if the enemy was any good at the craft. Sometimes
both sides could get so confused that very strange things happened.
Tragedies, sometimes. Cities burned that no one had any interest in
burning, except that the burners believed what was untrue, and
thousands died. Crops destroyed for the same reason, and tens of
thousands died in the famine that followed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I won&rsquo;t crack my teeth about this
<em>a&rsquo;dam</em> for men,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I suppose somebody has
thought to tell&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;him?&rdquo; Colors flashed. Maybe he could just
ignore them, or grow used to them. They were gone as fast as they
came, and they did not hurt. He just did not like things he could
not understand. Especially when they might have to do with the
Power in some way. The silver foxhead under his shirt might protect
him against the Power, but that protection had as many holes as his
own memories.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have not exactly been in regular communication,&rdquo;
Thom said dryly, waggling his eyebrows. &ldquo;I suppose Elayne and
Nynaeve have found some way to let him know, if they think it
important.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should they?&rdquo; Juilin said, bending to tug off a
boot with a grunt. &ldquo;The thing is at the bottom of the sea.&rdquo;
Scowling, he hurled the boot at the bundled dresses in the corner.
&ldquo;Are you going to let us get any sleep tonight, Mat? I don&rsquo;t
think we&rsquo;ll have any tomorrow night, and I like to sleep at
least every other night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That night, Mat chose to sleep in Tylin&rsquo;s bed.
Not for old times&rsquo; sake. That thought made him laugh, though
his laughter had too much of the sound of a whimper to be very
funny. It was just that a good feather mattress and goose-down
pillows were preferable to a hayloft when a man did not know when
his next decent night&rsquo;s sleep would come.</p>

<p>The trouble was that he could not sleep. He lay there
in the dark with an arm behind his head and the medallion&rsquo;s
leather cord looped through itself on his wrist, ready to hand in
case the <em>gholam</em> slid through the crack under the door, but
it was not the <em>gholam</em> that kept him awake. He could not
stop going over the plan in his head. It was a good plan, and
simple; as simple as it could be, in the circumstances. Only, no
battle ever went according to plan, even the best. Great captains
earned their reputation not just for laying brilliant plans, but
for still being able to find victory after those plans began to
fall apart. So when first light illumined the windows, he was still
lying there, rolling the medallion across the back of his fingers
and trying to think of what was going to go wrong.</p>
