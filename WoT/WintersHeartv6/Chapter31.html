<h4><em>What the Aelfinn Said</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
Seanchan noblewoman expressed surprise, and no
little irritation, when Mat accompanied her toward the kennels.
Seta and Renna knew the way, of course, and he was supposed to be
getting his cloak and whatever else he meant to carry. The two
<em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> followed them through the poorly lit halls,
cloaks hanging down their backs and eyes on the floor. Domon
brought up the rear as though shepherding the pair. The braid
hanging down the side of his head swayed as his eyes darted down
every crossing corridor, and sometimes he felt at his waist as
though expecting to find a sword or a cudgel. Except for them, the
tapestry-lined hallways were silent and still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a small errand up there,&rdquo; Mat told Egeanin,
as casually as he knew how, and smiled for her. &ldquo;No need to bother
yourself. Won&rsquo;t take a minute.&rdquo; His very best smile seemed to
make no more impression than it had yesterday in her room at the
inn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you wreck me now&mdash;&rdquo; she growled in a
threatening tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just remember who planned this,&rdquo; he muttered, and
she grunted. Light, women always seemed to think they could just
step in and take over, and do a better job than the man whose job
it was!</p>

<p>At least she made no further complaint. They climbed
quickly to the top floor of the Palace, then up the dark narrow
stairs to the sprawling attic. Only a few of the lamps were lit,
not even as many as in the hallways below, and the maze of narrow
corridors between the tiny wooden rooms was a mass of pale shadows.
Nothing moved, and Mat breathed a little more easily. He would have
breathed easier still if Renna had not sighed with obvious
relief.</p>

<p>She and Seta knew where the various <em>damane</em>
were kenneled, and if they did not exactly hurry, they made no
delay in heading deeper in the attic, perhaps because Domon still
walked at their heels. It was not an image to inspire confidence.
Well, if wishes were horses, beggars would ride. A man made do with
what he had. Especially when he had no choice.</p>

<p>Egeanin gave him a last hard look and growled again,
wordlessly this time, then strode off after the others, her cloak
flaring behind her. He grimaced at her back. The way the woman
walked, you could take her for a man if she was not wearing a
dress.</p>

<p>He did have an errand, and maybe not so small. It was
not something he wanted to do. Light, he had tried to talk himself
out of it! It was something he bloody well had to do, though. As
soon as Egeanin vanished around a corner after Domon and the
others, he darted for the nearest room that he remembered
containing one of the Sea Folk.</p>

<p>Easing open the plain wooden door soundlessly, he
slipped into the pitch-black interior. The sleeping woman inside
snored with a rasping sound. Slowly he felt his way forward until
his knee bumped into the bed, then felt along the mound beneath the
blankets more quickly, finding her head just in time to clamp his
hand over her mouth as she jerked awake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you to answer a question,&rdquo; he whispered.
Blood and ashes, what if he had mistaken the room? What if this was
not a Windfinder at all, but one of the bloody Seanchan women?
&ldquo;What would you do if I took that collar off your neck?&rdquo; Lifting
his hand, he held his breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would free my sisters, if it pleases the Light
that should happen.&rdquo; The Sea Folk accents in the darkness made him
breathe again. &ldquo;The Light be willing, we would cross the harbor,
somehow, to where our people are held, and free as many as we were
able.&rdquo; The unseen woman&rsquo;s voice remained low, but grew fiercer
by the word. &ldquo;The Light be willing, we would take back our ships,
and fight our way to sea. Now! If this is a trick, punish me for it
and be done, or kill me for it. I was on the brink of yielding, of
giving up myself, and the shame of that will burn me forever, but
you have reminded me who I am, and now I will never yield. Do you
hear me? Never!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if I asked you to wait for three hours?&rdquo; he
asked, still crouching over her. &ldquo;I remember the Atha&rsquo;an Miere
judging the passage of an hour within minutes.&rdquo; That fellow had not
been him, but the memory was his now, passage on an Atha&rsquo;an
Miere vessel from Allorallen to Barashta, and a bright-eyed Sea
Folk woman who wept when she refused to follow him ashore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m called Mat Cauthon, if it makes a
difference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Nestelle din Sakura South Star, Mat Cauthon.&rdquo;
He heard her spit, and knew what she was doing. He spat on his own
palm, and their two hands found each other in the darkness. Hers
was as callused as his, her grip strong. &ldquo;I will wait,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;And I will remember you. You are a great and good man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just a gambler,&rdquo; he told her. Her hand
guided his to the segmented collar around her neck, and it came
open for him with a metallic <em>snick</em>. She drew a very long
breath.</p>

<p>He only had to put her fingers in the proper places
and show her the trick once before she got it, but he made her
close and open the collar three times before he was satisfied. If
he was going to do this, he might as well make sure it was done
right. &ldquo;Three hours, as near as you can,&rdquo; he reminded her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As near as I can,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>She could ruin everything, but if he could not take a
chance, then who could? He was the man with the luck, after all.
Maybe it had not been all that much in evidence lately, but he had
found Egeanin just when he needed her. Mat Cauthon still had the
luck.</p>

<p>Slipping out of the room as quietly as he had
entered, he closed the door. And almost choked on his tongue. He
was staring at the back of a wide, gray-haired woman in a
red-paneled dress. Beyond her stood Egeanin drawn up to her full
height, and Teslyn, connected to Renna by the silver length of an
<em>a&rsquo;dam</em>. There was no sign of Domon or Seta or this
Edesina he still had not seen to know her. Egeanin looked fierce as
a lioness over her kill, but Teslyn was wide-eyed and trembling,
terrified half out other wits, and Renna&rsquo;s mouth had a twist
that said she might sick up any moment now.</p>

<p>Not daring to breathe, he took a cautious step toward
the gray-haired woman, stretching out his hands. If he overpowered
her before she could cry out, they could hide her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Where? Seta
and Renna would want to kill her. No matter what hold Egeanin had
on them, the woman could name them.</p>

<p>Egeanin&rsquo;s stern blue eyes caught his over the
gray-haired <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> shoulder for a brief instant
before focusing on the other woman&rsquo;s face again. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she
said sharply. &ldquo;There is no time to waste with changes to my plans,
now. The High Lady Suroth said I could use any <em>damane</em> I
wish, <em>Der&rsquo;sul&rsquo;dam</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, my Lady,&rdquo; the gray-haired woman replied,
sounding confused. &ldquo;I merely pointed out that Tessi is not really
trained. I actually came up to look in on her. She is coming along
very nicely, now, my Lady, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still not breathing, Mat backed away on tiptoe. He
eased down the dark narrow stairs using his hands against the walls
to support as much of his weight as possible. He did not remember
any creaky steps coming up, but there were chances, and then there
were chances. A man took those he had to, and did not press his
luck otherwise. That was the way to a long life, something he
wished for very much.</p>

<p>At the foot of the steps, he paused to suck in air
until his heart stopped pounding. Until it slowed a little, anyway.
It might not stop pounding till tomorrow. He was not sure he had
drawn breath since seeing the gray-haired woman. Light! If Egeanin
thought she had the matter in hand, well and bloody good, but just
the same, Light! She must have nooses around the two
<em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>&rsquo;s necks! <em>Her</em> plan? Well, she
had been right about no time to waste. He ran.</p>

<p>He ran until his hip gave a sharp twinge, and he
stumbled into a turquoise-inlaid table. He caught a summer tapestry
to keep from falling, and the bright-flowered length of silk tore
free from the yellow marble cornice for half its length. The tall
white porcelain vase sitting on the table toppled, shattering on
the blue-and-red floor tiles with a crash that echoed along the
hallway. After that, he hobbled. But he hobbled as fast as any man
ever had. If anyone came to investigate the noise, they were not
going to find Mat Cauthon standing over that mess, or within two
corridors of it.</p>

<p>Limping the rest of the way to Tylin&rsquo;s
apartments, he was across the sitting room and into the bedchamber
before he realized that the lamps were all lit. The blaze in the
bedroom fireplace had been renewed with split billets from the
gilded wood-basket. Tylin, her arms doubled behind her to work at
her buttons, looked up at his entrance and frowned. Her dark green
riding dress was wrinkled. The fire crackled and spat a shower of
sparks up the chimney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect you back yet,&rdquo; he said, trying
to think. Of everything he had considered going amiss tonight,
Tylin returning early had never been in it. His brain seemed
frozen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suroth learned that an army had vanished in
Murandy,&rdquo; Tylin replied slowly, straightening. She spoke absently,
giving what she said a fraction of the attention she put into
studying Mat Cauthon. &ldquo;What army, or how any army can vanish, I
don&rsquo;t know, but she decided her return was urgent. We left
everyone behind, came as fast as one of the beasts could carry just
the two of us and the woman who handled it, and commandeered two
horses to ride up from the docks alone. She even went to that inn
across the square where all their officers are instead of coming
here. I don&rsquo;t think she intends to sleep tonight, or let any
of them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letting her words trail off, Tylin glided to him
across the carpets and fingered his plain green coat. &ldquo;The trouble
with having a pet fox,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;is that sooner or later it
remembers it is a fox.&rdquo; Those big dark eyes peered up at him.
Suddenly she seized two handfuls of his hair and pulled his head
down for a kiss that curled his toes in his boots. &ldquo;That,&rdquo; she said
breathlessly when she finally let him go, &ldquo;is to show you how much
I will miss you.&rdquo; Without the slightest change of expression, she
slapped him so hard that silver flecks floated in front of his
eyes. &ldquo;And that is for trying to sneak away while I was gone.&rdquo;
Turning her back, she pulled her mane of raven hair over one
shoulder. &ldquo;Undo my buttons for me, my pretty little fox. We arrived
so late I decided not to wake my maids, but these fingernails make
buttons all but impossible. One last night together, and tomorrow I
will send you on your way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat rubbed his cheek. The woman could have broken a
tooth for him! At least she had jarred his thoughts loose. If
Suroth was at The Wandering Woman, she was not in the Tarasin
Palace to see what she should not. His luck was still good. He only
had to worry about the woman in front of him. The only way was
forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going tonight,&rdquo; he said, putting his hands
on Tylin&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;And when I do, I&rsquo;m taking a couple
of Aes Sedai from the attic. Come with me. I&rsquo;ll send Thom and
Juilin to find Beslan, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go <em>with</em> you?&rdquo; she said incredulously,
moving away and turning to face him. Her proud face was scornful.
&ldquo;Pigeon, I don&rsquo;t fancy becoming <em>your</em> pretty, and I
have no intention of becoming a refugee. Or of leaving Altara to
whoever the Seanchan choose to replace me. I am the Queen of
Altara, the Light help me, and I will not abandon my country now.
You really mean to try freeing the Aes Sedai? I wish you well in
it, if you must&mdash;I wish the sisters well&mdash;but it seems
a good way to have your head stuck up on a spike, sweetling.
It&rsquo;s too pretty a head to be cut off and covered with
tar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He tried to take her by the shoulders again, but she
stepped back with a piercing look that made his hands fall. He put
every scrap of urgency he could find into his voice. &ldquo;Tylin, I made
sure everybody knew I was leaving, and anxious to be gone before
you returned, so the Seanchan would know you didn&rsquo;t have
anything to do with it, but now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I returned and surprised you,&rdquo; she broke in
fiercely, &ldquo;and you tied me up and left me under the bed. When I am
discovered in the morning, I will be furious with you. Outraged!&rdquo;
She smiled, but her eyes glittered, not that far from outrage now,
whatever she said about foxes and sending him on his way. &ldquo;I will
offer a bounty for you, and tell Tuon she can buy you when
you&rsquo;re caught, if she still wants you. I will be the perfect
High Blood in my anger. They&rsquo;ll believe me, duckling.
I&rsquo;ve already told Suroth I intend to shave my hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat grinned weakly. He certainly believed her. She
really would sell him if he was caught. &ldquo;Women are a maze through
briars in the night,&rdquo; the old saying went, and even they do not
know the way.</p>

<p>Tylin insisted on supervising her own binding. She
seemed to take pride in it. She had to be bound with strips cut
from her skirts, as if she had come on him by surprise and been
overpowered. The knots had to be tight, so she could not escape
however she struggled, and she did struggle against them once they
were tied, thrashing about hard enough that it seemed she really
was trying to get free. Maybe she was; her mouth twisted in a snarl
when she failed. Her ankles and wrists had to be tied together in
the small of her back, and a leash run from her neck to one leg of
the bed, so she could not wriggle her way across the floor and out
into the hall. And of course, she could not be able to shout for
help, either. When he gently pushed one of her silk kerchiefs into
her mouth and tied another to hold it in place, she smiled, but her
eyes were fierce. A maze through briars in the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to miss you,&rdquo; he said quietly as he
pushed her beneath the edge of the bed. To his surprise, he
realized that he really would. Light! Hurriedly he gathered his
cloak and gloves and spear, and snuffed the lamps on his way out.
Women could tangle a man in that maze before he knew it.</p>

<p>The hallways remained empty, and silent save for the
sound of his own limping bootsteps, but any relief he felt vanished
when he reached the anteroom off the stableyard.</p>

<p>The single lit stand-lamp still cast a wavering light
on those inevitable flowered tapestries, but Juilin and his woman
were not there, and neither were Egeanin and the others. With the
time he had taken up with Tylin, they all should have been waiting
on him by now. Beyond the columned walk the rain was sheeting down
in a solid black curtain that hid everything. Could they have gone
on to the stables? That Egeanin seemed to change his plan whenever
it suited her.</p>

<p>Grumbling under his breath, he hitched his cloak
around him and prepared to make his way to the stables through the
downpour. He had had just about all he could take of women
tonight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you <em>are</em> intending to leave. I cannot
allow that, Toy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With an oath, he spun on his heel and found himself
facing Tuon, her dark face stern behind her long transparent veil.
The narrow circlet holding the veil on her shaven head was a mass
of firedrops and pearls, yet another fortune taken together with
the wide jeweled belt that cinched her waist and the long necklace
around her neck. A fine time it was to be noticing jewels, however
rich. What in the Light was she doing awake? Blood and ashes, if
she went running off, shouting for guards to stop him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!</p>

<p>Desperately he reached for the skinny girl, but she
writhed away from his grip and sent the <em>ashandarei</em> flying
with a sharp blow that half numbed his wrist. He expected her to
flee, but instead she rained blows at him, punching with folded
knuckles, chopping her hands like axe blades. He had quick hands,
the quickest Thom had ever seen according to the old gleeman, but
it was all he could do to ward her off, forget about grabbing her.
If he had not been trying so hard to keep her from breaking his
nose&mdash;or something else, maybe; she hit very hard for such a
tiny thing&mdash;except for that, he might have found the whole
thing laughable. He towered over her, though he was not much above
average height, yet she came at him in a concentrated fury, as
though she were the taller and stronger and expected to overwhelm
him. For some reason, after a few moments her full lips curved in a
smile, and if he had not known better, he would have said those big
liquid eyes took on a glow of delight. Burn him, thinking about how
pretty a woman was at a time like this was as bad as trying to
price her gems!</p>

<p>Abruptly, she flowed back from him, using both hands
to readjust the circle of gems that secured her veil. There was
certainly nothing like delight on her face now. Her expression was
all concentration. Placing her feet carefully, never taking her
eyes from his face, she began slowly gathering her white pleated
skirts in her hands, inching them up above her knees in folds.</p>

<p>He could not understand why she was not already
shouting for help, but he knew she was about to kick at him. Well,
not if he had anything to say about it! He leaped for her, and
everything happened at once. A stab of pain in his hip sent him to
one knee. Tuon snatched her skirts almost to her own hips, and her
slim, white-stockinged leg flashed out at him in a kick that passed
over his head as she was suddenly hoisted into the air.</p>

<p>He thought he must be as surprised to see Noal with
his arms wrapped around the girl as she was to have those arms
there, but he reacted faster than she. As she opened her mouth to
shout at last, Mat scrambled to his feet and began stuffing her
veil between her teeth, tipping the jeweled circlet to the floor
with a flip of his hand. She did not cooperate the way Tylin had,
of course. A firm grip on her jaw was all that kept her from
sinking her teeth into his fingers. Angry sounds came from her
throat, and her eyes showed a fury they never had at the worst of
her attack. She twisted in Noal&rsquo;s grip and flailed her legs,
but the worn old man managed to shift his burden and himself to
avoid every kick other heels. Worn or not, he seemed to have no
difficulty hanging on to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you often have this sort of trouble with women?&rdquo;
he asked mildly around a gap-toothed smile. He was wearing his
cloak, and his bundled belongings were tied over it across his
back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Always,&rdquo; Mat replied sourly, and grunted when a knee
caught his aching hip. Managing to untie his neck-scarf one-handed,
he used it to secure the wadded veil in Tuon&rsquo;s mouth at the
cost of a nipped thumb. Light, what was he going to <em>do</em>
with her?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know this was what you were planning,&rdquo;
Noal said, not breathing hard in spite of the way the tiny woman
thrashed herself about in his grip, &ldquo;but as you can see, I&rsquo;m
leaving tonight, too. I thought that in a day or two, this might be
an unpleasant place for someone you gave a bed to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A wise decision,&rdquo; Mat muttered. Light, he should
have thought of warning Noal.</p>

<p>Lowering himself to his knees, he avoided Tuon&rsquo;s
kicks&mdash;most of them, anyway&mdash;long enough to catch her
legs. A knife plucked from his sleeve started a cut in the hem of
her dress, and he tore away a long strip to tie her ankles. It was
a good thing he had gotten all that practice with Tylin earlier. He
was not accustomed to tying women up. Tearing off a second strip of
cloth from the bottom of her skirt, he picked up the circle of gems
from the floor, and stood with one grunt for the effort and a
deeper one for a last, two-legged kick that set fire to his hip.
When he set the circlet back on her head, Tuon stared him straight
in the eye. She had stopped thrashing about uselessly, but she was
not afraid. Light, in her place, he would have been soiling
himself.</p>

<p>Juilin finally arrived, then, cloaked and fully
accoutered, with his short sword and notched sword-breaker at his
belt and his thin bamboo staff in one hand. A slender, dark-haired
woman in the thick white robes worn by <em>da&rsquo;covale</em>
outside clung to his right arm. She was pretty, in a pouty way,
with a rosebud mouth, but five or six years older than Mat had
expected, and her large dark eyes darted timidly. At the sight of
Tuon, she squeaked and let go of Juilin as though he were a hot
stove, folding herself to the floor beside the door with her head
on her knees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had to talk Thera into running away all over
again,&rdquo; the thief-catcher sighed, giving her a concerned look. That
was all the explanation he made for his lateness, before turning
his attention to Noal&rsquo;s burden. Pushing back the ridiculous
conical red cap he wore, he scratched his head. &ldquo;And what do we do
with her?&rdquo; he asked simply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave her in the stables,&rdquo; Mat replied. They would
if Vanin had convinced the grooms to let him and Harnan tend to any
messengers&rsquo; horses that came in. Until now, that had seemed
like only an added precaution, not really necessary. Until now. &ldquo;In
the hayloft. She shouldn&rsquo;t be found before morning, when they
fork down fresh hay for the stalls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I thought you were kidnapping her,&rdquo; Noal sighed,
setting Tuon&rsquo;s bound feet back on the floor and shifting his
hold on her to gripping her upper arms. Head high, the little woman
disdained to struggle. Even with a gag in her mouth, scorn was
clear on her face. She refused to fight, not because it was
hopeless, but because she did not choose to fight.</p>

<p>Bootsteps echoed in the corridor leading to the
anteroom, growing louder. It could be Egeanin at last. Or the way
the night seemed to be turning, it might be Deathwatch Guards. The
Ogier sort.</p>

<p>Hastily, Mat motioned the other toward corners out of
sight of anyone coming through the door, then hobbled over to pick
up his black spear. Juilin pulled Thera to her feet and drew her to
his left, where she crouched in the corner while he stood in front
of her with his staff held in both hands. It appeared a frail
weapon, but the thief-catcher could use it to great effect. Noal
dragged Tuon to the opposite corner of the room and released one of
her arms to put a hand inside his coat, where he kept his long
knives. Mat planted himself in the middle of the room with his back
to the rain-soaked night, the <em>ashandarei</em> upright in front
of him. No matter who came into the room, he was not going to be
able to dance about, with his hip knotted in a fist from
Tuon&rsquo;s kicks, but if worse came to worst, he could at least
leave marks on a few people.</p>

<p>When Egeanin strode through that doorway, he sagged
on the spear in relief. Two <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> entered after
her, and Domon followed. Mat got his first look at Edesina to know
who he was seeing, though he did recall her from one day when the
<em>damane</em> were being exercised, a slender handsome woman in
one of those plain gray dresses, with black hair spilling to her
waist. Despite the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> leashing her to Seta&rsquo;s
wrist, Edesina looked about her calmly. An Aes Sedai on a leash,
perhaps, but an Aes Sedai confident that leash was coming off soon.
Teslyn, on the other hand, was a quivering mass of eagerness,
licking her lips and staring at the door to the stableyard. Renna
and Seta hurried the two Aes Sedai along behind Egeanin without
taking their eyes from the stableyard door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had to soothe the <em>der&rsquo;sul&rsquo;dam</em>,&rdquo;
Egeanin said, as soon as she was into the room. &ldquo;They are very
protective of their charges.&rdquo; Noticing Juilin and Thera, she
scowled; there had not seemed any reason to tell her about Thera,
not when she was willing to help <em>damane</em>, but clearly she
did not like the surprise of woolen robes. &ldquo;Her seeing Seta and
Renna changes a few things, of course,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;
Her words cut off as though sliced with a knife as her eyes fell on
Tuon. Egeanin was a pale woman, but she went paler. Tuon glared
back above her gag with the stern ferocity of a headsman. &ldquo;Oh,
Light!&rdquo; Egeanin said hoarsely, sinking to her knees. &ldquo;You madman!
It&rsquo;s death by slow torture to lay hands on the Daughter of the
Nine Moons!&rdquo; The two <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> gasped, and knelt
without hesitation, not only pulling the two Aes Sedai down with
them but gripping the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> right at the collar to
force their faces to the floor.</p>

<p>Mat grunted as though Tuon had just kicked him square
in the belly. He felt as if she had. The Daughter of the Nine
Moons. The Aelfinn had told him truth, much as he hated knowing. He
would die and live again, if he had not already. He would give up
half the light of the world to save the world, and he did not even
want to think about what that meant. He would marry&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;She is
my wife,&rdquo; he said softly. Somebody made a choking sound; he thought
it was Domon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Egeanin squeaked, her head whipping toward
him so fast that her tail of hair swung around to slap her face. He
would not have thought she <em>could</em> squeak. &ldquo;You cannot say
that! You <em>must</em> not say that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he demanded. The Aelfinn always gave true
answers. Always. &ldquo;She is my wife. Your bloody Daughter of the Nine
Moons is my wife!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They stared at him, except for Juilin, who took off
his cap and stared into that. Domon shook his head, and Noal
laughed softly. Egeanin&rsquo;s mouth hung open. The two
<em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> gaped as though at a madman, stark raving and
loose. Tuon stared, but her expression was absolutely unreadable,
hiding every thought behind those dark eyes. Oh, Light, what was he
to do? For one thing, get a move on before&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Selucia scurried into the room, and Mat groaned. Was
everybody in the whole bloody Palace going to walk in? Domon tried
to grab her, but she eluded him, darting about. The buxom
golden-haired <em>so&rsquo;jhin</em> was not so stately as usual,
wringing her hands and looking around in a hunted fashion. &ldquo;Forgive
me for speaking,&rdquo; she said in a fear-filled voice, &ldquo;but what you do
is foolish beyond madness.&rdquo; With a groan, she darted to half crouch
between the kneeling <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> with one hand on the
shoulder of each, as though seeking their protection. Her blue eyes
never ceased flitting about the room. &ldquo;Whatever the omens, this can
still be rectified if you will only consent to draw back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be easy, Selucia,&rdquo; Mat said in a soothing. She was
not looking at him, but he made calming gestures anyway. In none of
his memories could he find a way to deal with a hysterical woman.
Except to hide. &ldquo;No one is going to be hurt. No one! I promise you.
You can be easy, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For some reason, consternation flashed across her
face, but she settled to her knees and folded her hands in her lap.
Suddenly, all her fear vanished, and she was as regal as ever she
had been. &ldquo;I will obey you, so long as you do not harm my mistress.
If you do, I will kill you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From Egeanin, that would have given him pause. Coming
from this plump cream-cheeked woman, short even if she was taller
than her mistress, he put it out of his mind. The Light knew women
were dangerous, but he thought he could handle a lady&rsquo;s maid.
At least she was no longer hysterical. Odd, how that came and went
in women.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you mean to leave them <em>both</em> in
the hayloft?&rdquo; Noal said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Mat replied, looking at Tuon. She stared right
back, still with no expression he could read. A boy-slim little
woman, when he liked women with flesh on their bones. Heir to the
Seanchan throne, when noblewomen gave him goose bumps. A woman who
had wanted to <em>buy</em> him, and now likely wanted to put a
knife in his ribs. And she would be his wife. The Aelfinn always
gave true answers. &ldquo;We are taking them with us,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>At last, Tuon showed expression. She smiled, as if
she suddenly knew a secret. She smiled, and he shivered. Oh, Light,
how he shivered.</p>
