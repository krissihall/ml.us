<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n
his room at The Counsel&rsquo;s Head, Rand sat on
the bed with his legs folded and his back against the wall, playing
the silver-mounted flute Thom Merrilin had given him so long ago.
An Age ago. This room, with carved wall panels and windows
overlooking the Nethvin Market, was better than that they had
abandoned at The Crown of Maredo. The pillows stacked beside him
were goose down, the bed had an embroidered canopy and curtains,
and the mirror above the washstand had not a single bubble. The
lintel above the stone fireplace even had a bit of simple carving.
It was a room for a well-to-do foreign merchant. He was glad he had
thought to bring enough gold when he left Cairhien. He had lost the
habit of carrying much. Everything had been provided for the Dragon
Reborn. Still, he could have earned a bed of some sort with the
flute. The tune was called &ldquo;Lament for the Long Night,&rdquo; and he had
never heard it before in his life. Lews Therin had, though. It was
like the skill at drawing. Rand thought that should frighten him,
or make him angry, but he simply sat and played while Lews Therin
wept.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light, Rand,&rdquo; Min muttered, &ldquo;are you just going to
sit there puffing on that thing?&rdquo; Her skirts swirled as she paced
up and down the flowered carpet. The bond with her and Elayne and
Aviendha felt as though he had never known anything else or wanted
to. He breathed, and he was bonded to them; one was as natural as
the other. &ldquo;If she says one wrong word where it can be overheard,
if she&rsquo;s already said it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I am not letting anyone haul
you off to a cell for Elaida!&rdquo; Alanna&rsquo;s bond had never felt
that way. It had not changed, not in itself, yet increasingly since
that day in Caemlyn, Alanna&rsquo;s bond seemed an intrusion, a
stranger looking over his shoulder, a sandspur in his boot. &ldquo;Do you
have to play that? It makes me want to cry, and it makes my skin
crawl at the same time. If she puts you in danger&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&rdquo; Snatching
one of her knives from its hiding place up a loose-fitting sleeve,
she flourished it in her fist.</p>

<p>He took the flute away from his mouth and silently
looked at her over it. Her face reddened, and with a sudden snarl,
she hurled the blade to stick quivering in the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s there,&rdquo; he said, using the flute to
point. Unconsciously, he shifted the instrument, following Alanna
exactly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be here soon.&rdquo; She had been in Far Madding
since the day before, and he did not understand why she had waited
till now. Alanna was a tangle of emotions inside his skull, nervous
and wary, worried and determined and above all, angry. In a barely
restrained fury. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d rather not be here, you can wait&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Min shook her head fiercely. Right beside Alanna in his head
lay the bundle that was her. She bubbled with worry and anger, too,
but love shone through like a beacon whenever she looked at him and
often when she did not. Fear shone through, as well, though she was
trying to hide that.</p>

<p>He put the flute back to his lips and began &ldquo;The
Drunken Peddler.&rdquo; That was jolly enough to cheer the dead. Lews
Therin snarled at him.</p>

<p>Min stood studying him, her arms folded, then
abruptly gave her dress a twitch, settling it on her hips. With a
sigh, he lowered the flute and waited. When a woman adjusted her
clothes for no reason, it was like a man tightening the straps of
his armor and checking his saddle girth; she meant to drive home a
charge, and you would be cut down like a dog if you ran.
Determination was as strong in Min now as it was in Alanna, twin
suns flaring in the back of his brain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will not talk about Alanna any more until she
gets here,&rdquo; she said firmly, as though he had been the one
insisting. Determination, and still the fear, stronger now than
before, continually trampled down and continually springing back
up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course, wife, if it pleases you,&rdquo; he
replied, bending his neck in the approved Far Madding fashion. She
sniffed loudly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand, I like Alivia. I do, even if she does make
Nynaeve have kittens left and right.&rdquo; One fist planted on her hip,
Min leaned forward and pointed a finger at his nose. &ldquo;But she is
going to kill you.&rdquo; She bit off every word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You said she was going to help me die,&rdquo; he said
quietly. &ldquo;Those were your words.&rdquo; How would he feel at dying?
Sadness at leaving her, at leaving Elayne and Aviendha. Sadness for
the pain he had brought them. He would like to see his father again
before the end. Aside from those things, he almost thought death
would be a relief.</p>

<p><em>Death is a relief</em>, Lews Therin said
fervently. <em>I</em> want <em>death. We deserve death!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Helping me die isn&rsquo;t the same as killing me,&rdquo;
Rand went on. He was very good at ignoring the voice, now. &ldquo;Unless
you&rsquo;ve changed your mind about what you saw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min flung up her hands in exasperation. &ldquo;I saw what I
saw and it&rsquo;s what I told you, but the Pit of Doom swallow me
if I can see any difference. And I can&rsquo;t see why you think
there is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sooner or later, I have to die, Min,&rdquo; he said
patiently. He had been told by those he had to believe. To live,
you must die. That still made no sense to him, but it left one cold
hard fact. Just as the Prophecies of the Dragon seemed to say, he
had to die. &ldquo;Not soon, I hope. I plan not soon. I&rsquo;m sorry,
Min. I never should have let you bond me.&rdquo; But he had not been
strong enough to refuse, any more than he had been strong enough to
push her away. He was too weak for what had to be done. He needed
to drink in winter, till he made winter&rsquo;s heart seem Sunday
noon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;d have tied you up and
done it anyway.&rdquo; Best not to ask how that would have differed from
what Alanna had done, he decided. Certainly, she saw a difference.
Climbing onto the bed on her knees, she cupped his face in her
hands, &ldquo;You listen to me, Rand al&rsquo;Thor. I won&rsquo;t let you
die. And if you manage it just to spite me, I&rsquo;ll follow you
and bring you back.&rdquo; Suddenly a thick vein of amusement rippled
through the seriousness he felt in his head. Her voice took on a
mock sternness: &ldquo;And then I&rsquo;ll bring you back here to live.
I&rsquo;ll make you grow your hair below your waist and wear hair
clips with moonstones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiled at her. She could still make him smile. &ldquo;I
never heard of a fate worse than death, but I think that fits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Someone knocked at the door, and Min froze. In a
silent question, she mouthed Alanna&rsquo;s name. Rand nodded, and
to his amazement, Min pushed him over onto the pillows and flung
herself on his chest. Squirming around, she raised her head, and he
realized she was trying to see herself in the washstand mirror.
Finally she found a position she liked, lying half on top of him
with one hand behind his neck and the other beside her face on his
chest. &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; she called.</p>

<p>Cadsuane stepped into the room and stopped, frowning
at the knife stuck in the door. In a dress of fine dark green wool
and a fur-lined cloak held by a silver brooch at the neck, she
might have passed for a successful merchant or a banker, though the
golden birds and fish, stars and moons dangling from the iron-gray
bun atop her head would have been ostentatious for either. She was
not wearing her Great Serpent ring, so it seemed she was making
some effort to avoid too much notice. &ldquo;Have you children been
arguing?&rdquo; she asked mildly.</p>

<p>Rand could almost feel Lews Therin go still, like a
ridge cat crouching in the shadows. Lews Therin was almost as wary
of this woman as he was himself.</p>

<p>Red-faced, Min scrambled to her feet smoothing
furiously at her dress. &ldquo;You said it was her!&rdquo; she said accusingly,
just as Alanna entered. Cadsuane closed the door.</p>

<p>Alanna glanced once at Min and dismissed her,
focusing on Rand. Without taking her dark eyes from him, she swept
her cloak off and flung it over one of the room&rsquo;s two chairs.
Her hands settled on her dark gray skirts, gripping them hard. She
was not wearing her golden Aes Sedai ring, either. From the moment
her eyes fell on him, joy bloomed along the bond. All the rest was
still there, the nervousness, the fury, but he had never expected
her to feel joy!</p>

<p>Not changing how he lay, he picked up the flute and
toyed with it. &ldquo;Should I be surprised to see you, Cadsuane? You pop
up when I don&rsquo;t want to see you too often to suit. Who taught
you to Travel?&rdquo; It had to have been that. One moment Alanna had
been a vague awareness on the edge of thought, and the next she
sprang to life full strength in his head. At first, he had thought
she herself had learned Traveling somehow, but seeing Cadsuane, he
knew better.</p>

<p>Alanna&rsquo;s mouth tightened, and even Min looked
disapproving. The emotions flowing along the Warder bond from one
jumped and skittered; from the other, there was just anger mingled
with delight, now. Why did Alanna feel <em>joy</em>?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still no more manners than a goat, I see,&rdquo; Cadsuane
said dryly. &ldquo;Boy, I hardly think I need your permission to visit my
birthplace. As for Traveling, it is none of your business where or
when I learned anything.&rdquo; Unpinning her cloak, she stuck the brooch
on her belt, ready to hand, and folded the cloak over one arm as
though making it neat were much more important than he was. Her
voice took on an edge of irritation. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve lumbered me with
a lot of traveling companions, one way and another. Alanna was so
frantic to see you again, only a heart of stone could have refused
to bring her, and Sorilea said some of the others who pledged
themselves to you would be good for nothing until they were allowed
to go with Alanna, so I&rsquo;ve ended up bringing Nesune, Sarene,
Erian, Beldeine and Elza, too. Not to mention Harine, plus her
sister and that Swordmaster of hers. She didn&rsquo;t know whether to
faint, scream or bite someone when she found out Alanna was going
off to find you. And then there are those three black-coated
friends of yours. I don&rsquo;t know how eager they are to see you,
but they&rsquo;re here, as well. Well, now that we&rsquo;ve located
you, I can send the Sea Folk and the sisters to you and let you
deal with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand sprang to his feet with a muttered oath. &ldquo;No!
Keep them away from me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cadsuane&rsquo;s dark eyes narrowed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve warned
you before about your language; I will not warn you again.&rdquo; She
frowned at him a moment longer, then nodded as though she thought
he had taken the lesson to heart. &ldquo;Now, what makes you think you
can tell me what to do, boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand struggled with himself. He could not issue
orders here. He had never been able to order Cadsuane anywhere. Min
said he needed the woman, that she would teach him something he
needed to learn, but if anything, that only made him more uneasy
about her. &ldquo;I want to finish my business here and leave quietly,&rdquo;
he said at last. &ldquo;If you tell them, at least make sure they see I
can&rsquo;t afford to have them come anywhere near me, not until
I&rsquo;m ready to leave.&rdquo; The woman raised an eyebrow at him,
waiting, and he took a deep breath. Why did she always need to make
everything difficult? &ldquo;I would appreciate it very much if you
didn&rsquo;t tell any of them where I am.&rdquo; Reluctantly, very
reluctantly, he added, &ldquo;Please.&rdquo; Min exhaled as though she had been
holding her breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Cadsuane said after a moment. &ldquo;You can show
manners when you try, even if it does make you look as though your
teeth ached. I suppose I can keep your secret for you, for the time
being. Not all of them even know you are in the city. Oh, yes. I
should tell you, Merise has bonded Narishma, Corele has Damer, and
young Hopwil is Daigian&rsquo;s.&rdquo; She said that as though it were
just a casual bit of information that might easily have slipped her
mind.</p>

<p>He did not bother to mutter his oath this time, and
Cadsuane&rsquo;s full-armed slap almost unhinged his jaw. Black
spots shimmered in front of his eyes. One of the other women
gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did tell you,&rdquo; Cadsuane said placidly. &ldquo;No more
warnings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min took a step toward him, and he shook his head
slightly. It helped to clear the spots. He wanted to rub his jaw,
but he kept his hands at his sides. He had to make himself loosen
his grip on the flute. For Cadsuane&rsquo;s part, the slap might
never had occurred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why would Flinn and the others accept being bonded?&rdquo;
he demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask them when you see them,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Min, I
suspect Alanna wants to be alone with him awhile.&rdquo; Turning toward
the door without waiting for Min&rsquo;s reply, she added, &ldquo;Alanna,
I will be waiting below, in the Women&rsquo;s Room. Don&rsquo;t be
too long. I want to get back to the Heights. Min?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min glared at Alanna. She glared at Rand. Then she
flung up her hands and stalked out after Cadsuane, muttering under
her breath. She slammed the door behind her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I liked you better with your own hair.&rdquo; Alanna
folded her arms beneath her breasts and studied him. Anger and joy
warred with one another in the bond. &ldquo;I had hoped that being close
to you would be better, but you are still like a stone in my head.
Even standing here, I can hardly tell whether you&rsquo;re upset or
not. Even so, being here is better. I dislike being parted from a
Warder so long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand ignored her and the rippling joy that flowed
along the bond. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t ask why I came to Far Madding,&rdquo;
Rand said quietly, staring at the door as if he could see Cadsuane
through the wood. Surely, she had to wonder. &ldquo;You told her I was
here, Alanna. It had to be you. What happened to your oath?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alanna drew a deep breath, and a moment passed before
she replied. &ldquo;I am not sure Cadsuane cares two pins about you,&rdquo; she
snapped. &ldquo;I keep that oath as well as I can, but you do make
keeping it hard.&rdquo; Her voice began to harden, and anger welled more
strongly through the bond. &ldquo;I owe fealty to a man who walks off and
leaves me behind. Just how am I supposed to serve you? More
importantly, what did you do?&rdquo; Crossing the carpet, she stood
staring up at him, fury burning in her eyes. He topped her by more
than a foot, and she seemed not to notice. &ldquo;You did something, I
know. I was unconscious for three days! What did you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I decided if I was going to be bonded, it might as
well be by someone I said could.&rdquo; He barely caught her hand before
it landed on his face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been slapped enough for one
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She glared up at him, teeth bared as if ready to bite
out his throat. The bond carried only fury and outrage, now,
distilled to daggers. &ldquo;You let someone else <em>bond</em> you?&rdquo; she
snarled. &ldquo;How dare you! Whoever she is, I&rsquo;ll see her before a
court! I&rsquo;ll see her <em>birched</em>! You are mine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you <em>took</em> me, Alanna,&rdquo; he said
coldly. &ldquo;If more sisters knew, <em>you</em> would be the one
birched.&rdquo; Min had told him once that he could trust Alanna, that
she had seen the Green and four other sisters &ldquo;in his hand.&rdquo; He did
trust her, in an odd fashion, yet he was in Alanna&rsquo;s hand,
too, and he did not want to be. &ldquo;Release me, and I&rsquo;ll deny it
ever happened.&rdquo; He had not even known that was possible until Lan
told him about himself and Myrelle. &ldquo;Release me, and I&rsquo;ll set
you free of your oath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The roiling anger flowing through the bond lessened
without disappearing, but her face grew calm, and her voice was
composed. &ldquo;You are hurting my wrist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He knew he was. He could feel the pain through the
bond. He let go, and she massaged her wrist far more ostentatiously
than required by the hurt he felt. Still rubbing her wrist, she sat
on the second chair and crossed her legs. She seemed to be
thinking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of being free of you,&rdquo; she said
finally. &ldquo;I have dreamed of it.&rdquo; She gave a small, rueful laugh. &ldquo;I
even asked Cadsuane to let me pass the bond to her. A sign of how
desperate I was, to ask such a thing. But if anyone can handle you,
Cadsuane can. Only, she refused. She was furious that I suggested
it without asking you, outraged, but even if you agreed, she
won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; She spread her hands. &ldquo;So you are mine.&rdquo; Her face did
not change, but as she said that, the joy flared anew. &ldquo;However I
acquired you, you are my Warder, and I have a responsibility. That
is as strong in me as the oath I swore to obey you. Every bit as
strong. So I will not release you to anyone unless I know she can
handle you properly. Who bonded you? If she is capable, I will let
her have you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just the possibility that Cadsuane might have
received his bond sent icicles down Rand&rsquo;s spine. Alanna had
never been able to control him with the bond, and he did not think
any sister could, but he would never risk it with that one.
Light!</p>

<p>&ldquo;What makes you think she doesn&rsquo;t care about
me?&rdquo; he demanded instead of answering Alanna&rsquo;s question. Trust
or no trust, no one would learn that answer if he could help it.
What Elayne and Min and Aviendha had done might be allowed by Tower
law, yet they had worse to fear than punishment from other Aes
Sedai if it came out they were linked to him in this way. Sitting
down on the edge of the bed, he turned the flute over in his hands.
&ldquo;Just because she refused my bond? Maybe she isn&rsquo;t as
nonchalant about the consequences as you. She came to me in
Cairhien, and stayed long after there could be any reason but me.
Am I really supposed to believe she just decided to visit friends
while I happen to be here? She brought you to Far Madding so she
could find me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand, she wanted to know where you were every day,&rdquo;
Alanna said dismissively, &ldquo;but I doubt there&rsquo;s a shepherd in
Seleisin who doesn&rsquo;t wonder where you are. The whole <em>
world</em> wants to know that. I knew you were far to the south,
that you hadn&rsquo;t moved for days. No more. When I found out she
and Verin were coming here, I had to beg her&mdash;beg on my
knees!&mdash;before she would let me come along. But I didn&rsquo;t
know myself that you were here until I came out of the gateway in
the hills above the city. Before that, I thought I might have to
Travel halfway to Tear to find you. Cadsuane taught me that, when
we came here, so don&rsquo;t think you can evade me so easily in the
future.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Cadsuane</em> had taught Alanna to Travel? That
still did not say who had taught Cadsuane, though. Not that it
mattered, he supposed. &ldquo;And Damer and the other two allowed
themselves to be bonded? Or did those sisters just take them the
way you took me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A faint flush stained her cheeks, but her voice was
steady. &ldquo;I heard Merise ask Jahar. It took him two days to accept,
and she never pressured him that I saw. I cannot speak for the
others, but as Cadsuane said, you can always ask them. Rand, you
must understand, those men were afraid to go back to this &lsquo;Black Tower&rsquo; of yours.&rdquo; Her mouth twisted sourly around
the name. &ldquo;They were afraid they would be blamed in the attack on
you. If they simply ran, they would be hunted down as deserters. I
understand that is your standing order? Where else could they go,
except to Aes Sedai? And a good thing they did, too.&rdquo; She smiled as
though she had just seen something wonderful, and her voice became
excited. &ldquo;Rand, Damer has discovered a way to Heal being stilled!
Light, I can say that word without freezing my tongue. He Healed
Irgain and Ronaille and Sashalle. They&rsquo;ve sworn fealty to you,
too, just like all the others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, all the others?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean all the sisters the Aiel were holding. Even
the Reds.&rdquo; She sounded half disbelieving about that, as well she
should, but disbelief melted into intensity as she put both feet on
the floor and leaned toward him, her eyes fixed on his. &ldquo;Every one
of them has sworn and accepted the penance you put on Nesune and
the others, the first five of them who swore. Cadsuane doesn&rsquo;t
trust them. She wouldn&rsquo;t let them bring any of their Warders.
I admit I was uncertain at first, but I believe you <em>can</em>
trust them. They swore oath to you. You know what that means for a
sister. We can&rsquo;t break an oath, Rand. It isn&rsquo;t
possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even the Reds. He had been surprised when those first
five captives offered fealty. Elaida had sent them to kidnap him,
and they had. He had been sure it was him being <em>
ta&rsquo;veren</em> that had done it, but that only altered chance,
made what might happen one time in a million become a certainty. It
was hard to believe that a Red would swear under any circumstances
to a man who could channel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need us, Rand.&rdquo; Rising, she shifted as if she
wanted to pace, but instead she stood watching him, unblinking. Her
hands smoothed her skirts as if she was unaware of what they were
doing. &ldquo;You need the support of Aes Sedai. Without it, you will
have to conquer every nation, and you haven&rsquo;t done very well
at that thus far. The rebellion in Cairhien might seem finished to
you, but not everyone likes Dobraine being named your Steward. A
good many might go to Toram Riatin, if he reappears. The High Lord
Darlin is snug in the Stone, so we hear, announced as your Steward
in Tear, but the rebels there haven&rsquo;t come streaming out of
Haddon Mirk to support him. As for Andor, Elayne Trakand might say
she will support you once she has the throne, but she has
maneuvered your soldiers out of Caemlyn, and I&rsquo;ll wear bells
in the Blight if she lets them remain in Andor when she does
succeed. Sisters can help you. Elayne will listen to us. The rebels
in Cairhien and Tear will listen. The White Tower has stopped wars
and ended rebellions for three thousand years. You may not like the
treaty Rafela and Merana negotiated with Harine, but they got
everything you asked for. Light, man, let us help you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand nodded slowly. It had seemed just a way to
impress people with his power, that Aes Sedai gave him fealty. Fear
that they might manipulate him to their own ends had blinded him to
anything else. He did not like admitting that. He had been a
fool.</p>

<p><em>A man who trusts everyone is a fool</em>, Lews
Therin said, <em>and a man who trusts no one is a fool. We are all
fools, if we live long enough</em>. He almost sounded sane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go back to Cairhien,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Tell Rafela and
Merana I want them to approach the rebels in Haddon Mirk. Tell them
to take Bera and Kiruna, too.&rdquo; Those were the four besides Alanna
whom Min said he could trust. What had she said about the five
others Cadsuane had brought with her? That each would serve him in
her fashion. That was not strong enough, not yet. &ldquo;I want Darlin
Sisnera as my Steward and the laws I made left in place. They can
negotiate away anything else as long as they end the rebellion.
After that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alanna&rsquo;s face had fallen, and she had sagged
back in her chair. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;ve come all this
way, and you are sending me right off again. I suppose it is for
the best, with that girl here,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;You have no idea what
I went through in Cairhien, masking the bond just enough to keep
what the two of you were doing from keeping me awake all night.
That is much harder than simply masking it completely, but I
dislike losing touch with my Warders completely. Only, going back
to Cairhien will be almost as bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand cleared his throat. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I want you
to do.&rdquo; Women, he had learned, talked about some things much more
openly than men, but it was still a shock when they did. He hoped
Elayne and Aviendha masked the bond when he was making love with
Min. When the two of them were together in bed, no one else existed
except her, the same as it had been with Elayne. He certainly did
not want to talk about it with Alanna. &ldquo;I may be done here by the
time you finish in Cairhien. If I haven&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;If I
haven&rsquo;t, you can return here. But you&rsquo;ll have to stay
away from me until I say otherwise.&rdquo; Even with that restriction,
the joy billowed up in her afresh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t going to tell me who bonded you, are
you?&rdquo; He shook his head, and she sighed. &ldquo;I had better go.&rdquo; Rising,
she took up her cloak and draped it over her arm. &ldquo;Cadsuane is
impatient at best. Sorilea admonished her to look after us like a
mother hen, and she does. After her fashion.&rdquo; At the door, she
paused for one last question. &ldquo;Why <em>are</em> you here, Rand?
Cadsuane may not care, but I do. I&rsquo;ll keep it secret, if you
wish. I have never been able to stay more than a few days in a <em>
stedding</em>. Why would you be willing to stay here, where you
can&rsquo;t even feel the Source?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it isn&rsquo;t that bad for me,&rdquo; he lied. He
could tell her, he realized. He did trust her to keep it secret.
But she did see him as her Warder, and she was a Green. No
explanation could make her let him face it alone, but in Far
Madding, she was no better able to defend herself than Min, maybe
less. &ldquo;Go on, Alanna. I&rsquo;ve wasted enough time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once she was gone, he shifted himself to put his back
against the wall again and sat fingering the flute. He thought
instead of playing, though. Min said he needed Cadsuane, but
Cadsuane was not interested in him except as a curiosity. A
bad-mannered curiosity. Somehow, he had to make her interested. How
in the Light was he going to do that?</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">With some difficulty Verin squeezed herself out of
the sedan chair in the courtyard of Aleis&rsquo; palace. She was
simply not constructed to fit the things, but they were the fastest
way to get about in Far Madding. Coaches always bogged down in the
crowds sooner or later, and they could not go some places she
wanted to. The damp winds off the lake were turning colder as
evening deepened into twilight, but she let the wind whip her cloak
about while she dug two silver pennies from her purse and gave them
to the bearers. She was not supposed to, of course, since they were
Aleis&rsquo; boys, but Eadwina would not know that. They should not
have accepted, but the silver vanished into their coats in a
twinkling, and the younger of the pair, a handsome fellow in his
middle years, even made her a flourishing bow before they picked up
the chair and trotted off toward the stable, a low structure set in
a corner against the front wall. Verin sighed. A boy in his middle
years. It had not taken her long back in Far Madding to begin
thinking as if she had never left. She had to be careful about
that. It could be dangerous, not least if Aleis or the others
discovered her deception. She suspected the warrants for Verin
Mathwin&rsquo;s exile had never been suspended. Far Madding kept
quiet when an Aes Sedai fell afoul of the law, but the Counsels had
no reason to fear Aes Sedai, and for its own reasons, the Tower in
turn kept quiet on those rare occasions when a sister found herself
strung up for a judicial flogging. She had no intention of being
the latest reason for the Tower to keep silence.</p>

<p>Aleis&rsquo; palace was not a patch on the Sun Palace,
of course, or the Royal Palace in Andor, or any of the palaces
kings and queens ruled from. It was her own property, not attached
to her position as First Counsel. Others, larger and smaller,
marched away on either side, each surrounded by a high wall except
on the end where the Heights, the only point approaching a hill on
the entire island, fell away to the water in a sheer bluff. Still,
it was not small, either. The Barsalla women had been dealing in
trade and politics since the city was still called Fel Moreina.
Tall-columned walks surrounded the Barsalla palace on both levels,
and the white marble cube covered most of the walled grounds.</p>

<p>She found Cadsuane in a sitting room that would have
offered a good view of the lake if the curtains had not been drawn
to keep in the warmth of the blaze in the wide marble fireplace.
Cadsuane sat, with her sewing basket on a small inlaid table beside
her chair, calmly working with needle and embroidery hoop. She was
not alone. Verin folded her cloak over the back of a padded chair
and took another to wait.</p>

<p>Elza barely glanced at her. The usually
pleasant-faced Green stood on the carpet in front of Cadsuane
looking quite fierce, her face red and her eyes glaring. Elza was
always very conscious of where she stood with respect to other
sisters, perhaps too much so. For her to ignore Verin, much less
confront Cadsuane, she must have been in a fine swivet. &ldquo;How could
you let her go?&rdquo; she demanded of Cadsuane. &ldquo;How are we to find him
without her?&rdquo; Ah, so that was it.</p>

<p>Cadsuane&rsquo;s head remained bent over her
embroidery hoop, and her needle continued to make tiny stitches.
&ldquo;You can wait until she returns,&rdquo; she said calmly.</p>

<p>Elza&rsquo;s hands doubled into fists at her side.
&ldquo;How can you be so detached?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;He is the Dragon
Reborn! This place could be a death trap for him! You have to&mdash;!&rdquo; Her teeth snapped shut as Cadsuane held up a finger. That
was all Cadsuane did, but from her it was enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve put up with your tirade long enough, Elza.
You may go. Now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elza hesitated, but she really had no choice. Her
face was still red as she bobbed a curtsy with her dark green
skirts clutched in her fists, but if she stalked from the sitting
room, she still left without further delay.</p>

<p>Cadsuane set the embroidery hoop on her lap and
leaned back. &ldquo;Will you make me some tea, Verin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In spite of herself, Verin gave a small start. The
other sister had not looked in her direction once. &ldquo;Of course,
Cadsuane.&rdquo; A heavily worked silver teapot sat on a four-legged
stand on one of the side tables, and was still hot, luckily. &ldquo;Was
it wise to let Alanna go?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could hardly stop her without letting the boy know
more than he should, now could I?&rdquo; Cadsuane replied dryly.</p>

<p>Taking her time, Verin tipped the teapot to pour into
a thin blue porcelain cup. Not Sea Folk porcelain, but very fine.
&ldquo;Do you have any idea why he came to Far Madding, of all places? I
nearly swallowed my tongue when it came to me that the reason he
had stopped leaping about might be because he was here. If
it&rsquo;s something dangerous, perhaps we should try to stop
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Verin, he can do whatever his heart desires,
anything at all, as long as he lives to reach Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don.
And as long as I can be at his side long enough to make him learn
how to laugh again, and cry.&rdquo; Closing her eyes, she rubbed her
temples with her fingertips and sighed. &ldquo;He is turning into a
stone, Verin, and if he doesn&rsquo;t relearn that he&rsquo;s human,
winning the Last Battle may not be much better than losing. Young
Min told him he needs me; I got that much out of her without
rousing her suspicions. But I must wait for him to come to me. You
see the way he runs roughshod over Alanna and the others. It will
be hard enough teaching him, if he does ask. He fights guidance, he
thinks he must do everything, learn everything, on his own, and if
I do not make him work for it, he won&rsquo;t learn at all.&rdquo; Her
hands dropped onto the embroidery hoop on her lap. &ldquo;I seem to be in
a confiding mood tonight. Unusual, for me. If you ever finish
pouring that tea, I may confide some more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; of course.&rdquo; Hastily filling a second cup,
Verin slipped the small vial back into her pouch unopened. It was
good to be sure of Cadsuane at last. &ldquo;Do you take honey?&rdquo; she asked
in her most muddled voice. &ldquo;I never can remember.&rdquo;</p>
