<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
hawk soon passed out of sight, and the road
remained empty of other travelers, but press as Perrin would,
frozen ruts ready to break a horse&rsquo;s leg and a rider&rsquo;s
neck allowed no great speed. The wind carried ice, and a promise of
snow again tomorrow. It was mid-afternoon by the time he turned off
through the trees into white drifts that were knee-deep on the
horses in places, and covered the last mile to the forest camp
where he had left the Two Rivers men and the Aiel, the Mayeners and
Ghealdanin. And Faile. Nothing there was as he expected.</p>

<p>As always, there were four camps spaced out among the
trees, in truth, but the Winged Guards&rsquo; smoking campfires
stood abandoned around Berelain&rsquo;s striped tents, amid
overturned kettles and bits of gear dropped on the snow, and the
same signs of haste dotted the trampled ground where
Alliandre&rsquo;s soldiers had been set up when he left that
morning. The only evidence of life in either place was the horse
handlers and farriers and cart drivers, bundled in woolens and
huddled in clumps around the horselines and high-wheeled supply
carts. They were all staring toward what caught his eye and held
it.</p>

<p>Five hundred paces from the rocky, flat-topped hill
where the Wise Ones had placed their low tents, the gray-coated
Mayeners were drawn up, all nine hundred or so of them, horses
stamping impatiently, red cloaks and the long red streamers on
their lances rippling in the cold breeze. Nearer the hill and off
to one side, just at the near bank of a frozen stream, the
Ghealdanin made a block of lances just as large, these with green
streamers. The mounted soldiers&rsquo; green coats and armor
appeared drab compared with the Mayeners&rsquo; red helmets and
breastplates, but their officers sparkled in silvered armor and
scarlet coats and cloaks, with reins and saddlecloths fringed in
crimson. A brave show, for men on parade, but they were not
parading. The Winged Guards faced toward the Ghealdanin, the
Ghealdanin toward the hill. And the crest of the hill was ringed by
Two Rivers men, longbows in hand. No one had drawn, yet, but every
man had a shaft nocked and ready. It was madness.</p>

<p>Booting Stayer to as near a gallop as the bay could
manage, Perrin plowed through the snow, followed by the others,
until he reached the head of the Ghealdanin formation. Berelain was
there, in a fur-trimmed red cloak, and Gallenne, the one-eyed
Captain of her Winged Guards, and Annoura, her Aes Sedai advisor,
all apparently arguing with Alliandre&rsquo;s First Captain, a
short, hard-bitten fellow named Gerard Arganda, who was shaking his
head so hard the fat white plumes quivered on his gleaming helmet.
The First of Mayene looked ready to bite iron, vexation showed
through Annoura&rsquo;s Aes Sedai calm, and Gallenne was fingering
the red-plumed helmet hanging at his saddle as though deciding
whether to don it. At the sight of Perrin, they broke off and
turned their mounts toward him. Berelain sat her saddle erect, but
her black hair was windblown, and her fine-ankled white mare was
shivering, the lather of a hard run freezing on her flanks.</p>

<p>With so many people about, it was all but impossible
to make out individual scents, but Perrin did not need his nose to
recognize trouble hanging by a hair. Before he could demand to know
what in the Light they thought they were doing, Berelain spoke with
a porcelain-faced formality that made him blink at first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord Perrin, your Lady wife and I were hunting with
Queen Alliandre when we were attacked by Aiel. I managed to
escape. No one else in the party has returned yet, though it may be
the Aiel took prisoners. I have sent a squad of lancers to scout.
We were about ten miles to the southeast, so they should return
with news by nightfall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faile was captured?&rdquo; Perrin said thickly. Even
before crossing into Amadicia from Ghealdan they had heard of Aiel
burning and looting, but it had always been somewhere else, the
next village over or the one beyond that, if not farther. Never
close enough to worry about, or to be sure they were more than
rumor. Not when he had Rand bloody al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s orders to
carry out! And look what it had cost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you all still here?&rdquo; he demanded aloud. &ldquo;Why
aren&rsquo;t you all searching for her?&rdquo; He realized he was
shouting. He wanted to howl, to savage them. &ldquo;Burn you all, what
are you waiting for?&rdquo; The levelness of her reply, as if reporting
how much fodder was left for the horses, pushed needles of rage
into his head. The more so because she was right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were ambushed by two or three hundred, Lord
Perrin, but you know as well as I, from what we have heard there
easily could be a dozen or more such bands roaming the countryside.
If we pursue in force, we may find a battle that will cost us
heavily, against Aiel, without even knowing whether they are the
ones who hold your Lady wife. Or even if she still lives. We must
know that first, Lord Perrin, or the rest is worse than
useless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If she still lived. He shivered; the cold was inside
him, suddenly. In his bones. His heart. She had to be alive. She
had to be. Oh, Light, he should have let her come to Abila with
him. Annoura&rsquo;s wide-mouthed face was a mask of sympathy framed
by thin Taraboner braids. Suddenly he became aware of pain in his
hands, cramping on the reins. He forced them to loosen their grip,
flexed his fingers inside his gauntlets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Elyas said quietly, moving his
gelding closer. &ldquo;Hold on to yourself. Blunder around with Aiel, and
you&rsquo;re asking to die. Maybe take a lot of men with you to a
bad end. Dying does no good if it leaves your wife a prisoner.&rdquo; He
tried to make his voice lighter, but Perrin could smell the strain.
&ldquo;Anyway, we&rsquo;ll find her, boy. She could well have escaped
them, a woman like that. Be trying to make her way back here afoot.
Take time, that would, in a dress. The First&rsquo;s scouts will
locate traces.&rdquo; Raking fingers through his long beard, Elyas gave a
self-deprecating chuckle. &ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t find more than the
Mayeners, I&rsquo;ll eat bark. We&rsquo;ll get her back for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin was not fooled. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said harshly. Nobody
could escape Aiel afoot. &ldquo;Go now. Hurry.&rdquo; Not fooled at all. The
man expected to find Faile&rsquo;s body. She had to be alive, and
that meant captive, but better a prisoner than&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They could not talk between themselves as they did
with wolves, but Elyas hesitated as if he understood Perrin&rsquo;s
thoughts. He did not try to deny them, though. His gelding set off
southeast at a walk, as quick as the snow would allow, and after a
quick glance at Perrin, Aram followed, his face dark. The one-time
Tinker did not like Elyas, but he near enough worshipped Faile, if
only because she was Perrin&rsquo;s wife.</p>

<p>It would do no good to founder the animals, Perrin
told himself, frowning at their retreating backs. He wanted them
to run. He wanted to run with them. Fine cracks seemed to be
spidering through him. If they returned with the wrong news, he
would shatter. To his surprise, the three Warders trotted their
mounts through the trees after Elyas and Aram in splashes of snow,
plain woolen cloaks streaming behind, then matched speed when they
caught up.</p>

<p>He managed to give Masuri and Seonid a grateful nod,
and included Edarra and Carelle. Whoever had made the suggestion,
there was no doubt who had granted permission. It was a measure of
the control the Wise Ones had established that neither sister was
trying to take charge. They very likely wanted to, but their gloved
hands remained folded on the pommels of their saddles, and neither
betrayed impatience by so much as the flicker of an eyelid.</p>

<p>Not everyone was watching the departing men. Annoura
alternated between beaming sympathy at him and studying the Wise
Ones out of the corner of her eye. Unlike the other two sisters,
she had made no promises, but she was almost as circumspect with
the Aielwomen as they. Gallenne&rsquo;s one eye was on Berelain,
awaiting a sign he should draw the sword he was gripping, while she
was intent on Perrin, her face still smooth and unreadable. Grady
and Neald had their heads together, casting quick, grim glances in
his direction. Balwer sat very still, like a sparrow perched on the
saddle, trying to be invisible, listening intently.</p>

<p>Arganda pushed his tall roan gelding past
Gallenne&rsquo;s heavy-chested black, ignoring the Mayener&rsquo;s
one-eyed glare of outrage. The First Captain&rsquo;s mouth worked
angrily behind the shining face-bars of his helmet, but Perrin
heard nothing. Faile filled his head. Oh, Light, Faile! His chest
felt bound with iron straps. He was near to panic, holding to the
precipice with his fingernails.</p>

<p>Desperately he reached out with his mind, frantically
searching for wolves. Elyas must have tried this already&mdash;Elyas would not have given way to panic at the news&mdash;but he
had to try himself.</p>

<p>Searching, he found them, Three Toes&rsquo; pack and
Cold Water&rsquo;s, Twilight&rsquo;s and Springhorn&rsquo;s and
others. Pain flowed out with his plea for help, but grew greater
inside him rather than less. They had heard of Young Bull, and they
commiserated over the loss of his she, but they kept clear of the
two-legs, who frightened away all the game and were death for any
wolf caught alone. There were so many packs of two-legs about,
afoot and riding the hard-footed four-legs, that they could not say
whether any they knew of were the one he sought. Two-legs were
two-legs, to them, indistinguishable except for those who could
channel, and the few who could speak with them. Mourn, they told
him, and move on, and meet her again in the Wolf Dream.</p>

<p>One by one, the images that his mind turned to words
faded away, until only one lingered. Mourn, and meet her again in
the Wolf Dream. Then that also was gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you listening?&rdquo; Arganda demanded roughly. He was
not a smooth-faced noble, and despite his silks and the gold-work
atop the silver of his breastplate he looked like what he was, a
graying soldier who had first hefted a lance as a boy and probably
carried two dozen scars. His dark eyes were almost as fevered as
those of Masema&rsquo;s men. He smelled of rage, and fear. &ldquo;Those
savages took Queen Alliandre, as well!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will find your Queen when we find my wife,&rdquo;
Perrin said, his voice as cold and hard as the edge of his axe. She
had to be alive. &ldquo;Suppose you tell me what all this is about, you
drawn up ready to charge, it looks like. And facing my people, at
that.&rdquo; He had other responsibilities, too. Acknowledging that was
bitter as gall. Nothing else counted alongside Faile. Nothing! But
the Two Rivers men <em>were</em> his people.</p>

<p>Arganda dashed his mount close and seized
Perrin&rsquo;s sleeve in a gauntleted fist. &ldquo;You listen to me! The
First Lady Berelain says it was Aiel took Queen Alliandre, and
there are Aiel sheltering behind those archers of yours. I have men
who will be happy enough to put them to the question.&rdquo; His heated
gaze swung back to Edarra and Carelle for a moment. Perhaps he was
thinking that they were Aiel with no archers barring his path.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The First Captain is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;overwrought,&rdquo; Berelain
murmured, laying a hand on Perrin&rsquo;s other arm. &ldquo;I have
explained to him that none of the Aiel here were involved. I&rsquo;m
sure that I can convince him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shook her off, ripped his arm away from the
Ghealdanin. &ldquo;Alliandre swore fealty to me, Arganda. You swore
fealty to her, and that makes me your lord. I said I&rsquo;ll find
Alliandre when I find Faile.&rdquo; The edge of an axe. She <em>was</em>
alive. &ldquo;You question no one, <em>touch</em> no one, unless I say. What you
will do is take your men back to your camp, <em>now</em>, and be
ready to ride when I give the order. If you&rsquo;re not ready when
I call, you will be left behind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arganda stared at him, breathing hard. His eyes
strayed again, this time toward Grady and Neald, then jerked back
to Perrin&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;As you command, my Lord,&rdquo; he said stiffly.
Wheeling his roan, he shouted orders to his officers and was
already galloping away before they began issuing their own. The
Ghealdanin began to peel away by columns, riding after their First
Captain. Toward their camp, though whether Arganda intended to
remain there was anyone&rsquo;s guess. And whether it might not be
for the worse if he did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You handled that very well, Perrin,&rdquo; Berelain said.
&ldquo;A difficult situation, and a painful time for you.&rdquo; Not formal at
all, now. Just a woman full of pity, her smile compassionate. Oh,
she had a thousand guises, Berelain did.</p>

<p>She stretched out a red-gloved hand, and he backed
Stayer away before she could touch him. &ldquo;Give it over, burn you!&rdquo;
he snarled. &ldquo;My wife has been taken! I&rsquo;ve no patience for your
childish games!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She jerked as if he had struck her. Color bloomed in
her cheeks, and she changed again, becoming supple and willowy in
her saddle. &ldquo;Not childish, Perrin,&rdquo; she murmured, her voice rich
and amused. &ldquo;Two women contesting over you, and you the prize? I
would think you&rsquo;d be flattered. Attend me, Lord Captain
Gallenne. I suppose we, too, should be ready to ride at
command.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The one-eyed man rode back toward the Winged Guards
at her side, as close to a canter as the snow made possible. He was
leaning toward her as if hearing instructions. Annoura paused where
she was, gathering the reins other brown mare. Her mouth was a
razored line beneath her beak of a nose. &ldquo;Sometimes you are a very
large fool, Perrin Aybara. Quite often, in fact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not know what she was talking about, and did
not care. At times she seemed resigned to Berelain chasing after a
married man, and other times amused by it, even helping out by
arranging for Berelain to be alone with him. Right then, First and
Aes Sedai both disgusted him. Heeling Stayer in the flanks, he
trotted away from her without a word.</p>

<p>The men on the hilltop opened enough to let him
through, muttering to one another and watching the lancers below
ride toward their respective camps, parted again to let the Wise
Ones and Aes Sedai and Asha&rsquo;man pass. They did not break up
and crowd around him, as he had expected, for which he was
grateful. The whole hilltop smelled of wariness. Most of it
did.</p>

<p>The snow atop the hill had been trampled until some
patches were clear except for frozen clumps and others were sheets
of ice. The four Wise Ones who had remained behind when he rode to
Abila were standing in front of one of the low Aiel tents, tall
unruffled women with dark woolen shawls around their shoulders,
watching the two sisters dismount with Carelle and Edarra, and
seemingly paying no mind to what was going on around them. The <em>
gai&rsquo;shain</em> who served them in place of servants were going
about their normal tasks quietly, meekly, faces hidden in the deep
cowls of their white robes. One fellow was even beating a carpet
hung over a rope tied between two trees! The only sign among the
Aiel that they might have been on the brink of a fight was Gaul and
the Maidens. They had been squatting on their heels, <em>
shoufa</em> around their heads and black veils hiding all but their
eyes, short spears and bull-hide bucklers in hand. As Perrin jumped
down from his saddle, they rose.</p>

<p>Dannil Lewin trotted up, chewing worriedly at the
thick mustache that made his nose look even bigger than it was. He
had his bow in one hand and was sliding an arrow back into the
quiver at his belt. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what else to do, Perrin,&rdquo;
he said in a jerky voice. Dannil had been at Dumai&rsquo;s Wells,
and faced Trollocs back home, but this was outside his view of the
world. &ldquo;By the time we found out what happened, those Ghealdanin
fellows were already starting this way, so I sent off Jondyn Barran
and a couple of others, Hu Marwin and Get Ayliah, told the
Cairhienin and your servants to make a circle with the carts and
stay inside it&mdash;had to just about tie up those folks
who&rsquo;re always following the Lady Faile around; they wanted to
go off after her, and not a one of them knows a footprint from an
oak tree&mdash;then I brought everybody else here. I thought those
Ghealdanin might charge us, until the First got there with her men.
They must be crazy, thinking any of our Aiel would hurt the Lady
Faile.&rdquo; Even when they Perrined him, Faile nearly always received
the honorific from the Two Rivers men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did right, Dannil,&rdquo; Perrin said, tossing him
Stayer&rsquo;s reins. Hu and Get were good woodsmen, and Jondyn
Barran could follow yesterday&rsquo;s wind. Gaul and the Maidens
were starting to leave, in single file. They were still veiled.
&ldquo;Tell off one man in three to stay here,&rdquo; Perrin told Dannil
hurriedly; just because he had faced Arganda down was no reason to
believe the man had changed his mind, &ldquo;and send the rest back to
pack up. I want to ride as soon as there&rsquo;s word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without waiting on a reply, he hurried to put himself
in front of Gaul and stopped the taller man with a hand to his
chest. For some reason, Gaul&rsquo;s green eyes tightened above his
veil. Sulin and the rest of the Maidens strung out behind him went
up on the balls of their feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Find her for me, Gaul,&rdquo; Perrin said. &ldquo;All of you,
please find who took her. If anyone can track Aiel, it&rsquo;s
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tightness in Gaul&rsquo;s eyes vanished as
suddenly as it had come, and the Maidens relaxed, too. As much as
Aiel ever could be said to relax. It was very strange. They could
not think he blamed them in any way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We all wake from the dream one day,&rdquo; Gaul said
gently, &ldquo;but if she still dreams, we will find her. But if Aiel
took her, we must go. They will move quickly. Even in&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;this.&rdquo;
He put considerable disgust in the word, kicking at a clod of
snow.</p>

<p>Perrin nodded and hastily stepped aside, letting the
Aiel set out at a trot. He doubted they could maintain that for
very long, but he was sure they would keep the pace longer than
anyone else could have. As the Maidens passed him, each quickly
pressed fingers to the veil over her lips, then touched his
shoulder. Sulin, right behind Gaul, gave him a nod, but none said a
word. Faile would have known what they meant with their finger
kissing.</p>

<p>There was something else odd about their departure,
he realized as the last Maiden went by. They were letting Gaul
lead. Normally, any of them would have stuck a spear in him before
allowing that. Why&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Maybe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Chiad and Bain would have
been with Faile. Gaul did not care one way of the other about Bain,
but Chiad was a different matter. The Maidens certainly had not
been encouraging Gaul&rsquo;s hope that Chiad would give up the
spear to marry him&mdash;anything but!&mdash;yet maybe that was
it.</p>

<p>Perrin grunted in disgust at himself. Chiad and Bain,
and who else? Even blind with fear for Faile, he should have asked
that much. If he was going to get her back, he needed to strangle
fear and <em>see</em>. But it was like trying to strangle a
tree.</p>

<p>The flat hilltop swarmed now. Someone had already led
Stayer away, and Two Rivers men were leaving the ring around the
crest, hurrying toward their camp in a scattered stream, shouting
to one another about what they would have done had the lancers
charged. Occasionally a man raised his voice asking about Faile,
did anyone know if the Lady was safe, were they going to look for
her, but others always shushed him hurriedly with worried glances
at Perrin. The <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> went about their tasks
placidly in the middle of all the rush. Unless commanded to stop,
they would have done the same if a battle had swirled around them,
not raising a hand to help or hinder. The Wise Ones had all gone
into one of the tents with Seonid and Masuri, and the flaps were
not only down, but tied. They did not want to be disturbed. They
would be discussing Masema, no doubt. Possibly discussing how to
kill the man without him or Rand learning they had done it.</p>

<p>He smacked a fist into his palm in irritation. He had
actually forgotten Masema until now. The man was supposed to be
following before nightfall, with that honor guard of a hundred men.
With luck, the Mayener scouts would be back by then, and Elyas and
the others soon after.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord Perrin?&rdquo; Grady said behind him, and he
turned. The two Asha&rsquo;man stood in front of their horses,
fiddling uncertainly with their reins. Grady drew breath and went
on with Neald nodding agreement. &ldquo;The pair of us could cover a lot
of ground, Traveling. And if we find the lot who kidnapped her,
well, I doubt even a few hundred Aiel could stop two Asha&rsquo;man
from taking her back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin opened his mouth to tell them to start
immediately, then closed it again. Grady had been a farmer, true,
but never a hunter or woodsman. Neald thought any place without a
stone wall was a village. They might know a footprint from an oak
tree, yet if they did find tracks, very likely neither would be
able to say which direction they were headed. Of course, he could
go with them. He was not as good as Jondyn, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He could go,
and leave Dannil to deal with Arganda. And with Masema. Not to
mention the Wise Ones&rsquo; schemes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go get yourselves packed,&rdquo; he said quietly. Where
was Balwer? Nowhere in sight. Not very likely that <em>he</em> had
gone haring off to find Faile. &ldquo;You may be needed here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grady blinked in surprise, and Neald&rsquo;s mouth
dropped open.</p>

<p>Perrin gave them no chance to argue. He strode over
to the low tent with the tied flaps. There was no way to undo the
ties from the outside. When Wise Ones wanted to remain undisturbed,
they wanted to remain undisturbed, by clan chiefs or anyone else.
Including a wetlander lumbered with the title of Lord of the Two
Rivers. He drew his belt knife, and bent to slice the ties, but
before he could slide the blade through the tight crack between the
entry flaps, they jerked as if someone was unfastening them from
inside. He straightened and waited.</p>

<p>The tentflaps opened, and Nevarin slipped out. Her
shawl was tied around her waist, but except for the mist of her
breath, she gave no evidence of the icy air. Her green eyes took in
the knife in his hand, and she planted her fists on her hips in a
rattle of bracelets. She was near enough bone-thin, with long sandy
yellow hair held back by a dark folded kerchief, and more than a
hand taller than Nynaeve, but that was who she always made him
think of. She stood blocking the entrance to the tent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are impetuous, Perrin Aybara.&rdquo; Her light voice
was level, but he had the impression that she was considering
boxing his ears. Very much like Nynaeve. &ldquo;Though that might be
understandable, in the circumstances. What do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; He had to stop to swallow. &ldquo;How will
they treat her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot say, Perrin Aybara.&rdquo; There was no sympathy
on her face, no expression at all. Aiel could give Aes Sedai
lessons in that. &ldquo;Taking wetlanders captive is against custom,
except for Treekillers, though that has changed. So is killing
without need. But many have refused to accept the truths the
<em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> revealed. Some were taken by the Bleakness and
threw down their spears, yet they may have taken them up again.
Others simply left, to live as they believe we are meant to. I
cannot say what customs might be kept or abandoned by those who
have abandoned clan and sept.&rdquo; The only emotion she displayed was a
hint of disgust at the end, for those who abandoned clan and
sept.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light, woman, you must have some idea! Surely you
can make a guess&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not become irrational,&rdquo; she broke in sharply.
&ldquo;Men often do in such situations, but we have need of you. I think
it will do your standing with the other wetlanders no good if we
must bind you until you calm down. Go to your tent. If you cannot
control your thoughts, drink until you cannot think. And do not
bother us when we are in council.&rdquo; She ducked back into the tent,
and the flaps jerked closed and began to twitch as they were tied
again.</p>

<p>Perrin considered the closed flaps, running his thumb
over the blade of his knife, then shoved it into the sheath. They
just might do as Nevarin had threatened if he barged in. And they
could not tell him anything he wanted to know. He did not think she
would keep secrets at a time like this. Not about Faile,
anyway.</p>

<p>The hilltop had grown quieter, with most of the Two
Rivers men gone. The remainder, still watchful of the Ghealdanin
camp below, stamped their feet against the cold, but no one talked.
The scurrying <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> hardly made a sound. Trees
obscured parts of the Ghealdanin and Mayener camps, but Perrin
could see carts being loaded in both. He decided to leave men on
guard anyway. Arganda could be trying to lull him. A man who
smelled like that could be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Irrational</em>, he finished
the thought dryly.</p>

<p>There was nothing left for him to do on the hill, so
he set out to walk the half-mile to his tent. The tent he shared
with Faile. He stumbled as much as walked, laboring when the snow
rose around his legs. As much to stop it snapping in the wind as
for warmth, he held his cloak tight around him. There was no
warmth.</p>

<p>The Two Rivers camp was a swarm with activity when he
arrived. The carts still made a big circle, with men and women from
Dobraine&rsquo;s estates back in Cairhien loading them, and others
readying horses for saddling. In this depth of snow, cartwheels
might as well have tried to roll through mud, so they were all
lashed to the sides of the carts, now, replaced by pairs of broad
wooden sleds. Bundled against the weather till most seemed twice as
wide as they really were, the Cairhienin hardly paused to glance at
him, but every Two Rivers man who saw him stopped to stare until
someone else prodded the fellow to get on with whatever he was
about. Perrin was glad none gave words to the sympathy in those
stares. He thought he might break down and cry if anyone did.</p>

<p>There seemed to be nothing for him to do here,
either. His big tent&mdash;his and Faile&rsquo;s&mdash;was already
down and on a cart, along with its contents. Basel Gill was walking
along the carts with a long list in his hands. The stout man had
taken to the job of <em>shambayan</em>, running Faile&rsquo;s
household, Perrin&rsquo;s, like a squirrel to a corncrib. More used
to cities than traveling outside their walls, though, he suffered
from the cold, and wore not only a cloak but a thick scarf around
his neck, a floppy-brimmed felt hat and heavy woolen gloves. For
some reason, Gill flinched at the sight of him, and mumbled
something about seeing to the carts before hurrying off as fast as
he could. Odd.</p>

<p>Perrin did think of one thing then, and minding
Dannil, he gave orders to relieve the men on the hill every hour
and make sure everyone had a hot meal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take care of the men and horses first,&rdquo; a thin but
strong voice said. &ldquo;But then you must take care of yourself.
There&rsquo;s hot soup in the kettle, and bread of a sort, and
I&rsquo;ve put by some smoked ham. A full belly will make you look
less like murder walking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Lini,&rdquo; he said. Murder walking? Light, he
felt like one of the dead, not a murderer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll eat in a
little while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faile&rsquo;s chief maid was a frail-appearing woman,
with skin like parchment and white hair in a bun on top of her
head, but her back was straight and her dark eyes were clear and
sharp. Worry creased her forehead now, though, and her hands
gripped her cloak too tightly, straining. She would be worried
about Faile, certainly, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maighdin was with her,&rdquo; he said, and did not need
her nod. Maighdin was always with Faile, it seemed. A treasure,
Faile called her. And Lini seemed to consider the woman her
daughter, though sometimes Maighdin did not appear to enjoy that as
much as Lini did. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get them back,&rdquo; he promised. &ldquo;All of
them.&rdquo; His voice almost broke on that. &ldquo;Get on with your work,&rdquo; he
went on roughly, hurriedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll eat in a bit. I have to see
to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He strode away without finishing.</p>

<p>There was nothing he had to see to. Nothing he could
think of, except Faile. He hardly knew where he was heading until
his steps took him outside the circle of carts.</p>

<p>A hundred paces beyond the horselines, a low, stony
ridge thrust a black peak through the snow. From there, he would be
able to see the tracks left by Elyas and the others. From there, he
would see them returning.</p>

<p>His nose told him he was not alone well before he
reached the narrow crest of the ridge, told him who was up there.
The other man was not listening, because Perrin crunched his way to
the top before he sprang up from where he had been crouching on his
heels. Tallanvor&rsquo;s gauntleted hands kneaded his long sword
hilt, and he peered at Perrin uncertainly. A tall man who had taken
hard knocks in his life, he usually was very sure of himself.
Perhaps he expected a tirade for not having been there when Faile
was taken, though she had rejected the armsman as a bodyguard,
rejected any bodyguard. Beyond Bain and Chiad, at least, who
apparently did not count. Or maybe he just thought he would be sent
away, back to the carts, so Perrin could be alone. Perrin tried to
make his face look less like&mdash;what had Lini called it?&mdash;murder walking? Tallanvor was in love with Maighdin, and would be
wed to her soon if Faile&rsquo;s suspicions were correct. The man
had a right to keep watch.</p>

<p>They stood there on the ridge while twilight fell,
and nothing moved in the snowy forest they watched. Darkness came
without movement, and without Masema, but Perrin did not even think
of Masema. The gibbous moon shone white on the snow, giving nearly
as much light as a full moon, it seemed. Until scudding clouds
began to hide it, and moonshadows raced across the snow, thicker
and thicker. Snow began to fall with a dry rustling. Snow that
would bury traces and tracks. Silent in the cold, the two men stood
there, watching into the snowfall, waiting, hoping.</p>
