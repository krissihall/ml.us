<h4><em>Wonderful News</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
Sun Palace&rsquo;s sunroom was cold despite fires
roaring on hearths at either end of the room, thickly layered
carpets, and a slanted glass roof that let in bright morning light
where snow caught on the thin mountains did not shield it, but it
was suitable for holding audiences. Cadsuane had thought it best
not to appropriate the throne room. So far, Lord Dobraine had
remained quiet about her holding Caraline Damodred and Darlin
Sisnera&mdash;she saw no better way to keep them from going on
with their mischief than keeping them in a firm grip&mdash;but
Dobraine might begin to fuss over that if she pushed beyond what he
considered proper. He was too close to the boy for her to want to
force him, and faithful to his oaths. She could look back on her
life and recall failures, some bitterly regretted, and mistakes
that had cost lives, but she could not afford mistakes or failure
here. Most definitely not failure. Light, she wanted to
<em>bite</em> someone!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I demand the return of my Windfinder, Aes Sedai!&rdquo;
Harine din Togara, all in green brocaded silk, sat rigidly in front
of Cadsuane, her full mouth tight. Despite an unlined face, white
streaked her straight black hair. Wavemistress of her clan for ten
years, she had commanded a large vessel long before that. Her
Sailmistress, Derah din Selaan, a younger woman all in blue, sat on
a chair placed a careful foot farther back in accordance with their
notions of propriety. The pair might have been dark carvings of
outrage, and their outlandish jewelry somehow added to the effect.
Neither so much as flickered an eye toward Eben when he bowed and
offered silver goblets of hot spiced wine on a tray.</p>

<p>The boy did not seem to know what to do next when
they took nothing. Frowning uncertainly, he remained bent until
Daigian plucked at his red coat and led him away smiling, an amused
pouter pigeon in dark blue slashed with white. A slender lad with a
big nose and large ears, never to be called handsome much less
pretty, but she was very possessive of him. They took seats close
together on a padded bench in front of one of the fireplaces and
began playing cat&rsquo;s cradle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your sister is assisting us in learning what
happened on the unfortunate day,&rdquo; Cadsuane said smoothly, and
somewhat absently. Taking a swallow of her own spiced wine, she
waited, uncaring whether they saw her impatience. No matter how
Dobraine grumbled about how impossible it was to meet the terms of
that incredible bargain Rafela and Merana had made on behalf of the
al&rsquo;Thor boy, he still might have handled the Sea Folk himself.
She could hardly give them half of her mind. Probably that was just
as well for them. If she focused on the Atha&rsquo;an Miere, she
would be hard-pressed not to swat them like bitemes, though they
were not the real source of her exasperation.</p>

<p>Five sisters were arrayed around the fireplace at the
other end of the sunroom from Daigian and Eben. Nesune had a large
wood bound volume from the Palace library spread on a reading stand
in front other chair. Like the others, she wore a plain woolen
dress more suited to a merchant than an Aes Sedai. If any regretted
the lack of silks, or money for silks, they did not show it.
Sarene, with her thin, beaded braids, stood working at a large
embroidery frame, her needle making the tiny stitches of yet
another flower in a field of blossoms. Erian and Beldeine were
playing stones, watched by Elza, who waited her turn to take on the
winner. By all appearances they were enjoying an idle morning,
without a care in the world. Perhaps they knew they were here
because she wanted to study them. Why had they sworn fealty to the
al&rsquo;Thor boy? At least Kiruna and the others had been in his
presence when they decided to swear. She was willing to admit that
no one could resist the influence of a <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> when
it caught you. But these five had taken a harsh penance for
kidnapping him and reached their decision to offer oath before they
were brought near him. In the beginning she had been inclined to
accept their various explanations, but over the last few days that
inclination had taken hard knocks. Disturbingly hard knocks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My <em>Windfinder</em> is not subject to your
authority, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Harine said sharply, as if denying the blood
connection. &ldquo;Shalon must and will be returned to me at once.&rdquo; Derah
nodded curt agreement. Cadsuane thought the Sailmistress might do
the same if Harine ordered her to jump from a cliff. In the
Atha&rsquo;an Miere&rsquo;s hierarchy, Derah stood a long distance
below Harine. And that was almost as much as Cadsuane knew of them.
The Sea Folk might prove useful or might not, but she could find a
way to get a grip on them in any case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is an Aes Sedai inquiry,&rdquo; she replied blandly.
&ldquo;We must follow Tower law.&rdquo; Loosely interpreted, to be sure. She
had always believed the spirit of the law was far more important
than the letter.</p>

<p>Harine puffed up like an adder and began yet another
harangue listing her rights and demands, but Cadsuane listened with
half an ear.</p>

<p>She could almost understand Erian, a pale,
black-haired Illianer, fiercely insisting that she must be at the
boy&rsquo;s side when he fought the Last Battle. And Beldeine, so
new to the shawl that she had not yet achieved agelessness, so
determined to be everything that a Green should be. And Elza, a
pleasant-faced Andoran whose eyes almost glowed when she spoke of
making certain that he lived to face the Dark One. Another Green,
and even more intense than most. Nesune, hunched forward to peer at
her book, looked like a black-eyed bird examining a worm. A Brown,
she would climb into a box with a scorpion if she wanted to study
it. Sarene might be fool enough to be startled that anyone thought
her pretty, much less stunning, but the White insisted on the cool
precision of her logic; al&rsquo;Thor was the Dragon Reborn, and
logically, she must follow him. Tempestuous reasons, idiotic
reasons, yet she could have accepted them, if not for the
others.</p>

<p>The door to the hall opened to admit Verin and
Sorilea. The leathery, white-haired Aiel woman handed something
small to Verin that the Brown tucked into her belt pouch. Verin was
wearing a flowered brooch on her simple bronze-colored dress, the
first jewelry Cadsuane had ever seen on her aside from her Great
Serpent ring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will help you sleep,&rdquo; Sorilea said, &ldquo;but
remember, just three drops in water or one in wine. A little more,
and you might sleep a day or longer. Much more, and you will not
wake. There is no taste to warn you, so you must be careful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Verin was having trouble sleeping, too. Cadsuane
had not had a good night&rsquo;s rest since the boy fled the Sun
Palace. If she did not find one soon, she thought she
<em>might</em> bite someone. Nesune and the others were eyeing
Sorilea uneasily. The boy had made them <em>apprentice</em>
themselves to the Wise Ones, and they had learned that the Aiel
women took that very seriously. One snap of Sorilea&rsquo;s bony
fingers could end their idle morning.</p>

<p>Harine leaned forward out of her chair and gave
Cadsuane&rsquo;s cheek a sharp tap with her fingers! &ldquo;You are not
listening to me,&rdquo; she said harshly. Her face was a thunderhead, and
that of her Sailmistress scarcely less stormy. &ldquo;You <em>will</em>
listen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cadsuane put her hands together and regarded the
woman over her fingertips. No. She would not stand the Wavemistress
on her head here and now. She would not send the woman back to her
apartments weeping. She would be as diplomatic as Coiren could
wish. Hastily she scanned through what she had heard. &ldquo;You speak
for the Mistress of the Ships to the Atha&rsquo;an Miere, with all
of her authority, which is more than I can imagine,&rdquo; she said
mildly. &ldquo;If your Windfinder is not returned to you within the hour,
you will see that the Coramoor punishes me severely. You require an
apology for your Windfinder&rsquo;s imprisonment. And you require me
to make Lord Dobraine set aside the land promised by the Coramoor
immediately. I believe that covers the essential points.&rdquo; Except
for the one about having her flogged!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Harine said, leaning back comfortably, in
command now. Her smile was sickeningly self-satisfied. &ldquo;You will
learn that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not care a fig for your Coramoor,&rdquo; Cadsuane
continued, her voice still mild. All the figs in the world for the
Dragon Reborn, but not one for the Coramoor. She did not alter her
tone by a hair. &ldquo;If you ever touch me again without permission, I
will have you stripped, striped, bound and carried back to your
rooms in a sack.&rdquo; Well, diplomacy had never been her strongest
point. &ldquo;If you do not cease pestering me about your sister&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Well, I might actually grow angry.&rdquo; Standing, she ignored the Sea
Folk woman&rsquo;s indignant puffing and gaping and raised her voice
to be heard at the end of the room. &ldquo;Sarene!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The slender Taraboner whirled from her embroidery,
beaded braids clicking, and hurried to Cadsuane&rsquo;s side, barely
hesitating before spreading her dark gray skirts in a curtsy. The
Wise Ones had had to teach them to leap when a Wise One spoke, but
more than custom made them leap for her. There truly were
advantages to being a legend, especially an unpredictable
legend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Escort these two to their rooms,&rdquo; Cadsuane
commanded. &ldquo;They wish to fast and meditate on civility. See that
they do. And if they offer one uncivil word, spank them both. But
be diplomatic about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sarene gave a start, half opening her mouth as if to
protest the illogic of that, but one glance at Cadsuane&rsquo;s face
and she quickly turned to the Atha&rsquo;an Miere women, gesturing
for them to rise.</p>

<p>Harine sprang to her feet, her dark face hard and
scowling. Before she could utter a word of her no doubt furious
tirade, though, Derah touched her arm and leaned close to whisper
into her ring-heavy ear behind a cupped hand covered with dark
tattoos. Whatever the Sailmistress had to say, Harine closed her
mouth. Her expression certainly did not soften, yet she eyed the
sisters at the far end of the room and after a moment curtly
motioned Sarene to lead the way. Harine might pretend that it was
her decision to leave, but Derah followed so close on her heels she
appeared to be herding her and shot an uneasy glance back over her
shoulder before the door shut her from sight.</p>

<p>Cadsuane almost regretted giving that frivolous
order. Sarene would do exactly as she had been told. The Sea Folk
women were an irritant, and useless thus far, besides. The
irritation must be removed so she could concentrate on what was
important, and if she found a use for them, tools needed to be
shaped one way or another. She was too angry with them to care how
that was done, and it might as well begin now as later. No, she was
angry with the boy, but she could not lay hands on him yet.</p>

<p>With a loud harrumph, Sorilea turned from watching
Sarene and the Atha&rsquo;an Miere go and directed her scowl at the
sisters gathered at the end of the solar. Bracelets clattered on
her wrists as she adjusted her shawl. Another woman not in her best
temper. The Sea Folk had peculiar notions of &ldquo;Aiel savages&rdquo;&mdash;though in truth not that much stranger than some Cadsuane herself
had believed before meeting Sorilea&mdash;and the Wise One did not
like them a hair.</p>

<p>Cadsuane went to meet her with a smile. Sorilea was
not a woman you made come to you. Everyone thought they were
becoming friends&mdash;which they might yet, she realized in
surprise&mdash;but no one knew of their alliance. Eben appeared
with his tray, and appeared relieved when she set her half-empty
goblet on it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Late last night,&rdquo; Sorilea said as the red-coated boy
hurried back to Daigian, &ldquo;Chisaine Nurbaya asked to serve the
<em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>.&rdquo; Disapproval lay heavy in her voice.
&ldquo;Before first light, Janine Pavlara asked, then Innina Darenhold,
then Vayelle Kamsa. They had not been allowed to speak to one
another. There could be no collusion. I accepted their pleas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cadsuane made a vexed sound. &ldquo;I suppose you already
have them serving penance,&rdquo; she murmured, thinking hard. Nineteen
sisters had been prisoners in the Aiel camp, nineteen sisters sent
by that fool Elaida to kidnap the boy, and now they <em>all</em>
had sworn to follow him! These last were the worst. &ldquo;What could
make <em>Red</em> sisters swear fealty to a man who can
channel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verin began to make an observation, but fell silent
for the Aiel woman. Strangely, Verin had taken to her own enforced
apprenticeship like a heron to the marsh. She spent more time in
the Aiel camp than out of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not penance, Cadsuane Melaidhrin.&rdquo; Sorilea made a
dismissive gesture with one sinewy hand in another rattle of gold
and ivory bracelets. &ldquo;They are attempting to meet <em>toh</em> that
cannot be met. As foolish in its way as our naming them
<em>da&rsquo;tsang</em> in the first place, but perhaps they are not
beyond redemption if they are willing to try,&rdquo; she allowed
grudgingly. Sorilea more than merely disliked those nineteen
sisters. She gave a thin smile. &ldquo;In any event, we will teach them
much they need to learn.&rdquo; The woman seemed to believe all Aes Sedai
could do with time apprenticing under the Wise Ones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you will continue to watch them all closely,&rdquo;
Cadsuane said. &ldquo;Especially these last four.&rdquo; She was sure they
would keep that ridiculous oath, if not always in ways the boy
would like, but there was always the possibility that one or two
might be Black Ajah. Once she had thought herself on the point of
rooting out the Black only to watch her quarry slip through her
fingers like smoke, her bitterest failure except possibly for
failing to learn what Caraline Damodred&rsquo;s cousin had been up
to in the Borderlands until the knowledge was years too late to do
any good. Now, even the Black Ajah seemed a diversion from what was
truly important.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Apprentices are always watched closely,&rdquo; the
weathered woman replied. &ldquo;I think I must remind these others to be
grateful for being allowed to loll about like clan chiefs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The remaining four sisters in front of the fireplace
rose with alacrity at her approach, made deep curtsies, and
listened carefully to what she told them in a low voice with much
finger shaking. Sorilea might think she had much to teach them, but
they had already learned that an Aes Sedai shawl offered no
protection to a Wise One&rsquo;s apprentice. <em>Toh</em> seemed a
great deal like penance to Cadsuane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;formidable,&rdquo; Verin murmured. &ldquo;I am very
glad she is on our side. If she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cadsuane gave her a sharp look. &ldquo;You have the
appearance of a woman with something to say that you don&rsquo;t
want to. About Sorilea?&rdquo; That alliance was very vaguely defined.
Friendship or no friendship, she and the Wise One still might turn
out to be aiming at different goals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that,&rdquo; the stout little woman sighed. Despite a
square face, tilting her head to one side made her look like a very
plump sparrow. &ldquo;I know it was not my business, Cadsuane, but Bera
and Kiruna were getting nowhere with our guests, so I had a little
talk alone with Shalon. After a little <em>gentle</em> questioning,
she spilled out the whole story, and Ailil confirmed everything
once she realized I already knew. Soon after the Sea Folk first
arrived here, Ailil approached Shalon hoping to learn what they
wanted with young al&rsquo;Thor. For her part, Shalon wanted to
learn whatever she could about him, and about the situation here.
That led to meetings, which led to friendship, which led to them
becoming pillow friends. As much from loneliness as anything else,
I suspect. In any case, that was what they were hiding more than
their mutual snooping.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They put up with days under the question to hide
<em>that</em>?&rdquo; Cadsuane said incredulously. Bera and Kiruna had
had the pair howling!</p>

<p>Verin&rsquo;s eyes twinkled with suppressed mirth.
&ldquo;Cairhienin are prim and prudish, Cadsuane, in public at least.
They might carry on like rabbits when the curtains are drawn, but
they wouldn&rsquo;t admit to touching their own husbands if anyone
might overhear! And the Sea Folk are almost as straitlaced. At
least, Shalon is married to a man with duties elsewhere, and
breaking marriage vows is a very serious crime. A breach of proper
discipline, it seems. If her sister found out, Shalon would be&mdash;&lsquo;Windfinder on a rowboat,&rsquo; I think her exact words
were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cadsuane was aware of her hair ornaments swaying as
she shook her head. When the two women had been discovered right
after the attack on the Palace, bound and gagged and stuffed under
Ailil&rsquo;s bed, she had suspected they knew more of the attack
than they were admitting. Once they refused to say why they had
been meeting in secret, she was sure. Perhaps even that they were
involved in some way, though the attack apparently was the work of
renegade Asha&rsquo;man. Supposedly renegade, at least. All that
time and effort wasted on nothing. Or perhaps not quite nothing, if
they were so desperate to keep things hidden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Return the Lady Ailil to her apartments with
apologies for her treatment, Verin. Give her very&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;tenuous&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;assurances that her confidences will be kept. Be sure she is
aware just how tenuous. And suggest <em>strongly</em> that she
might wish to keep me abreast of anything she hears concerning her
brother.&rdquo; Blackmail was a tool she disliked using, but she had
already used it on the three Asha&rsquo;man, and Toram Riatin might
still cause trouble even if his rebellion did seem to have
evaporated. In truth, she cared little who sat on the Sun Throne,
yet the plots and schemes of those who considered thrones important
often had a way of interfering with more significant matters.</p>

<p>Verin smiled, her bun bobbing as she nodded. &ldquo;Oh,
yes, I think that will work very nicely. Especially since she
dislikes her brother intensely. The same for Shalon, I suppose?
Except that you will want to hear of events among the Atha&rsquo;an
Miere? I&rsquo;m not certain how far she will betray Marine, no
matter the consequences to herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She will betray what I require her to betray,&rdquo;
Cadsuane said grimly. &ldquo;Keep her until tomorrow, late.&rdquo; Harine must
not be allowed to think for a moment that her demands were being
met. The Sea Folk were another tool to be used on the boy, no more.
Everyone and everything had to be viewed in that light.</p>

<p>Beyond Verin, Corele slipped into the sunroom and
shut the door carefully behind her as if hoping not to disturb
anyone. That was not her way. Boyishly slim, with thick black
eyebrows and a mass of glossy black hair flowing down her back that
gave her a wild appearance no matter how neat her clothes were, the
Yellow was much more likely to sweep into a room laughing. Rubbing
the end of her upturned nose, she looked at Cadsuane hesitantly,
with none of the usual sparkle in her blue eyes.</p>

<p>Cadsuane made a peremptory gesture at her, and Corele
drew a breath and glided across the carpets gripping her
yellow-slashed blue skirts with both hands. Eyeing the sisters
clustered around Sorilea at the far end of the room, and Daigian
playing cat&rsquo;s cradle with Eben at the other end, she spoke in
a soft voice that carried the lilting accents of Murandy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have the most wonderful news, Cadsuane.&rdquo; By the
sound other, she was not all certain how wonderful it was. &ldquo;I know
you said I should keep Damer busy here in the Palace, but he
insisted on looking at the sisters still in the Aiel camp.
Mild-tempered as he is, he&rsquo;s very insistent when he wants to
be, and sure as the sun there&rsquo;s nothing can&rsquo;t be Healed.
And, well, the fact of it is, he&rsquo;s gone and Healed Irgain.
Cadsuane, it&rsquo;s as if she&rsquo;d never been&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She trailed
off, unable to say the word. It hung in the air even so.
Stilled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonderful news,&rdquo; Cadsuane said flatly. It was. Every
sister carried the fear somewhere deep inside that she might be cut
off from the Power. And now a way to Heal what could not be Healed
had been discovered. By a man. There would be tears and
recriminations before <em>this</em> was done with. In any case,
while every sister who heard would consider it a world-shaking
discovery&mdash;in more ways than one; a man!&mdash;it was a
storm in a teacup compared to Rand al&rsquo;Thor. &ldquo;I suppose she is
offering herself up to be beaten like the others?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t need to,&rdquo; Verin said absently. She
was frowning at an inkstain on her finger, but she seemed to be
studying something beyond. &ldquo;The Wise Ones apparently decided that
Rand had punished Irgain and the other two sufficiently when he&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;did what he did. At the same time they were treating the others
like worthless animals, they have been working to keep those three
alive. I heard talk about finding Ronaille a husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Irgain knows all about the oaths the others swore.&rdquo;
Corele&rsquo;s voice took on tones of amazement. &ldquo;She started
weeping for the loss of her Warders almost as soon as Damer
finished with her, but she&rsquo;s ready to swear, too. The thing of
it is, Damer wants to try with Sashalle and Ronaille, too.&rdquo;
Surprisingly, she drew herself up almost defiantly. She had always
been as arrogant as any other Yellow, but she had always known
where she stood with Cadsuane. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see letting a sister
remain in that condition if there&rsquo;s a way out, Cadsuane. I
want to let Damer try his hand with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, Corele.&rdquo; It seemed some of Damer&rsquo;s
insistence was rubbing off on her. Cadsuane was willing to let that
go, so long as it did not go too far. She had begun gathering
sisters she trusted, those here with her and others, the day she
first heard of strange events in Shienar&mdash;her eyes and ears
had kept watch on Siuan Sanche and Moiraine Damodred for years
without learning anything useful until then&mdash;yet just because
she trusted them did not mean she intended to let them start going
their own way. Too much lay at stake. But in any case, she could
not leave a sister like that, either.</p>

<p>The door banged open to admit Jahar at a run, the
silver bells on the ends of his dark braids jangling. Heads turned
to look at the youth in the well-fitted blue coat Merise had chosen
for him&mdash;even Sorilea and Sarene stared&mdash;but the words
that came out of him in a rush drove away thoughts of how pretty
his sun-dark face was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alanna&rsquo;s unconscious, Cadsuane. She just
collapsed in the hallway. Merise had her taken to a bedchamber and
sent me for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Riding over exclamations of shock, Cadsuane gathered
Corele and Sorilea&mdash;who could not be left behind in this&mdash;and ordered Jahar to lead the way. Verin came as well, and
Cadsuane did not stop her. Verin had a way of noticing what others
missed.</p>

<p>The black-liveried servants had no idea who or what
Jahar was, but they stepped lively to get out of Cadsuane&rsquo;s
way as she walked quickly along behind him. She would have told him
to be quicker about it, but any faster, and she would have had to
run. Before she had gone very far, a short man with the front of
his head shaved, in a dark coat with horizontal stripes of color
down the front, stepped into her path and bowed. She had to stop
for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grace favor you, Cadsuane Sedai,&rdquo; he said smoothly,
&ldquo;Forgive me for bothering you when you are in such a hurry, but I
thought I should tell you that the Lady Caraline and the High Lord
Darlin are no longer in the Lady Arilyn&rsquo;s palace. They are on
a rivership bound for Tear. Beyond your reach by this time, I
fear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might be surprised what is within my reach, Lord
Dobraine,&rdquo; she said in a cold voice. She should have left at least
one sister at Arilyn&rsquo;s palace, but she had been certain the
pair was secure. &ldquo;Was this wise?&rdquo; She had no doubt it was his work,
though she doubted he had the nerve to admit it. No wonder he had
not pressed her over them.</p>

<p>Her tone made no impression on the fellow. And he
surprised her. &ldquo;The High Lord Darlin is to be the Lord
Dragon&rsquo;s Steward of Tear, and it did seem wise to send the
Lady Caraline out of the country. She has foresworn her rebellion
and her claims to the Sun Throne, but others still might try to use
her. Perhaps, Cadsuane Sedai, it was unwise to leave them in the
charge of servants. Under the Light, you must not hold them at
fault. They were able to hold two&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;guests&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but not to
stand up to my armsmen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jahar was all but dancing with anxiety to go on.
Merise had a firm hand. Cadsuane herself was anxious to reach
Alanna.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you have the same opinion in a year,&rdquo; she
said. Dobraine merely bowed.</p>

<p>The bedchamber where Alanna had been taken was the
nearest that had been available, and it was not large, appearing
smaller for the dark paneling that Cairhienin liked so much. It
seemed quite crowded once everyone was inside. Merise snapped her
fingers and pointed, and Jahar retreated to a corner, but that
helped little.</p>

<p>Alanna was lying on the bed, her eyes closed, with
her Warder, Ihvon, kneeling beside it chafing her wrist. &ldquo;She seems
afraid to wake,&rdquo; the tall, slender man said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing
wrong with her that I can tell, but she seems afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Corele brushed him aside so she could cup
Alanna&rsquo;s face in her hands. The glow of <em>saidar</em>
surrounded the Yellow, and the weave of Healing settled on Alanna,
but the slim Green did not even twitch. Corele drew back, shaking
her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My skill with Healing, it may not equal yours,
Corele,&rdquo; Merise said dryly, &ldquo;but I did try.&rdquo; The accents of Tarabon
were still strong in her voice after all these years, but she wore
her dark hair drawn back severely from her stern face. Cadsuane
trusted her perhaps more than any of the others. &ldquo;What do we do
now, Cadsuane?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sorilea stared at the woman stretched out on the bed
with no expression beyond a thinning of her lips. Cadsuane wondered
whether she was reevaluating their alliance. Verin was staring at
Alanna, too, and she looked absolutely terrified. Cadsuane had not
thought anything could frighten Verin that far. But she felt a
thrill of terror herself. If she lost this connection to the boy
now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We sit down and wait for her to wake,&rdquo; she said in a
calm voice. There was nothing else to do. Nothing.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; Demandred growled, clenching his fists
behind his back. Standing with his feet apart, he was aware that he
dominated the room. He always did. Even so, he wished Semirhage or
Mesaana were present. Their alliance was delicate&mdash;a simple
agreement that they would not turn on one another until the others
had been eliminated&mdash;yet it had held all this time. Working
together, they had unbalanced opponent after opponent, toppling
many to their deaths or worse. But it was difficult for Semirhage
to attend these meetings, and Mesaana had been shy, of late. If she
was thinking of ending the alliance&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;Al&rsquo;Thor has been
seen in five cities, including that cursed place in the Waste, and
a dozen towns since those blind fools&mdash;those idiots!&mdash;failed in Cairhien. And that only includes the reports we have! The
Great Lord only knows what else is crawling toward us by horse, or
sheep, or whatever else these savages can find to carry a
message.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Graendal had chosen the setting, since she had been
first to arrive, and it irritated him. View-walls made the striped
wooden floor appear to be surrounded by a forest full of brightly
flowered vines and fluttering birds that were even more colorful.
Sweet scents and soft birdcalls filled the air. Only the arch of
the doorway spoiled the illusion. Why did she want a reminder of
what was lost? They could as soon make shocklances or sho-wings as
a view-wall outside of this place, close to Shayol Ghul. In any
case, she despised anything to do with nature, as he recalled.</p>

<p>Osan&rsquo;gar frowned at &ldquo;idiots&rdquo; and &ldquo;blind fools,&rdquo;
as well he might, but he quickly smoothed that plain, creased face,
so unlike the one he had been born with. By whatever name he was
called, he had always known who he dared challenge and who not. &ldquo;A
matter of chance,&rdquo; he said calmly, though he did begin dry-washing
his hands. An old habit. He was garbed like some ruler of this Age,
in a coat so heavy with golden embroidery that it almost hid the
red of the cloth, and boots fringed with golden tassels. There was
enough white lace at his neck and wrists to clothe a child. The man
had never known the meaning of excess. If not for his particular
skills, he never would have been Chosen. Realizing what his hands
were doing, Osan&rsquo;gar snatched the tall <em>cuendillar</em>
wineglass from the round table beside his chair and inhaled the
dark wine&rsquo;s aroma deeply. &ldquo;Simply probabilities,&rdquo; he murmured,
trying to sound offhand. &ldquo;Next time, he will be killed or taken.
Chance can&rsquo;t protect him forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are going to depend on chance?&rdquo; Aran&rsquo;gar
was stretched out in a long, flowing chair as though it were a
bedchair. Directing a smoky smile at Osan&rsquo;gar, she arched one
leg on bare toes so the slit in her bright red skirts exposed her
to the hip. Every breath threatened to free her from the red satin
that just contained her full breasts. All of her mannerisms had
changed since she became a woman, but not the core of what had been
placed into that female body. Demandred hardly scorned fleshly
pleasures, but one day her cravings would be the death of her. As
they already had been once. Not that he would mourn, of course, if
the next time was final. &ldquo;You were responsible for watching him,
Osan&rsquo;gar,&rdquo; she went on, her voice caressing every syllable.
&ldquo;You, and Demandred.&rdquo; Osan&rsquo;gar flinched, flicking his tongue
against his lips, and she laughed throatily. &ldquo;My own charge is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She pressed a thumb down on the edge of the chair as if pinning
something and laughed again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think you would be more worried,
Aran&rsquo;gar,&rdquo; Graendal murmured over her wine. She concealed her
contempt about as well as the almost transparent silvery mist of
her streith gown concealed her ripe curves. &ldquo;You, and
Osan&rsquo;gar, and Demandred. And Moridin, wherever he is. Perhaps
you should fear al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s success as much as his
failure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laughing, Aran&rsquo;gar caught the standing
woman&rsquo;s hand in one of hers. Her green eyes sparkled. &ldquo;And
perhaps you could explain what you mean better if we were
alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Graendal&rsquo;s gown turned to stark black concealing
smoke. Jerking her hand free with a coarse oath, she stalked away
from the chair. Aran&rsquo;gar&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;giggled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Osan&rsquo;gar said sharply,
struggling out of his chair. Once on his feet, he struck a
lecturer&rsquo;s pose, gripping his lapels, and his tone became
pedantic. &ldquo;In the first place, my dear Graendal, I doubt that even
I could devise a method to remove the Great Lord&rsquo;s shadow from
<em>saidin</em>. Al&rsquo;Thor is a primitive. Anything he tries
inevitably will prove insufficient, and I, for one, cannot believe
he can even imagine how to begin. In any event, we will stop him
trying because the Great Lord commands it. I can understand fear of
the Great Lord&rsquo;s displeasure if we somehow failed, unlikely as
that might be, but why should those of us you named have any
special fear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blind as ever, and dry as ever,&rdquo; Graendal murmured.
With the return of composure, her gown was clear mist again, though
red. Perhaps she was not so calm as she pretended. Or perhaps she
wanted them to believe she was controlling some agitation. Except
for the streith, her adornments all came from this age, firedrops
in her golden hair, a large ruby dangling between her breasts,
ornate golden bracelets on both wrists. And something quite
strange, that Demandred wondered whether anyone else had noticed. A
simple ring of gold on the little finger of her left hand. Simple
was never associated with Graendal. &ldquo;If the young man does somehow
remove the shadow, well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;You who channel <em>saidin</em> will
no longer need the Great Lord&rsquo;s special protection. Will he
trust your&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;loyalty&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;then?&rdquo; Smiling, she sipped her
wine.</p>

<p>Osan&rsquo;gar did not smile. His face paled, and he
scrubbed a hand across his mouth. Aran&rsquo;gar sat up on the edge
of her long chair, no longer trying to be sensuous. Her hands
formed claws on her lap, and she glared at Graendal as if ready to
go to her throat.</p>

<p>Demandred&rsquo;s fists unclenched. It was out in the
open at last. He had hoped to have al&rsquo;Thor dead&mdash;or
failing that, captive&mdash;before this suspicion reared its head.
During the War of Power, more than a dozen of the Chosen had died
of the Great Lord&rsquo;s suspicion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Great Lord is sure you are all faithful,&rdquo;
Moridin announced, striding in as though he were the Great Lord of
the Dark himself. He had often seemed to believe he was, and the
boy&rsquo;s face he wore now had not changed that. In spite of his
words, that face was grim, and his unrelieved black made his name,
Death, fit. &ldquo;You need not worry until he stops being sure.&rdquo; The
girl, Cyndane, trotted at his heels like a bosomy little
silver-haired pet in red-and-black. For some reason, Moridin had a
rat riding his shoulder, pale nose sniffing the air, black eyes
studying the room warily. Or for no reason, perhaps. A youthful
face had not made him any saner, either.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why have you called us here?&rdquo; Demandred demanded. &ldquo;I
have much to do, and no time for idle talk.&rdquo; Unconsciously he tried
to stand taller, to match the other man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mesaana is absent again?&rdquo; Moridin said instead of
answering. &ldquo;A pity. She should hear what I have to say.&rdquo; Plucking
the rat from his shoulder by its tail, he watched the animal wave
its legs futilely. Nothing except the rat seemed to exist for him.
&ldquo;Small, apparently unimportant matters can become very important,&rdquo;
he murmured. &ldquo;This rat. Whether Isam succeeds in finding and
killing that other vermin, Fain. A word whispered in the wrong ear,
or not spoken to the right. A butterfly stirs its wings on a
branch, and on the other side of the world a mountain collapses.&rdquo;
Suddenly the rat twisted, trying to sink its teeth into his wrist.
Casually, he flung the creature away. In midair, there was a burst
of flame, something hotter than flame, and the rat was gone.
Moridin smiled.</p>

<p>Demandred flinched in spite of himself. That had been
the True Power; he had felt nothing. A black speck floated across
Moridin&rsquo;s blue eyes, then another, in a steady stream. The man
must have been using the True Power exclusively since he last saw
him to gain so many <em>saa</em> so quickly. He himself had never
touched the True Power except at need. Great need. Of course, only
Moridin had that privilege now, since his&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;anointing. The man
truly was insane to use it so freely. It was a drug more addictive
than <em>saidin</em>, more deadly than poison.</p>

<p>Crossing the striped floor, Moridin laid a hand on
Osan&rsquo;gar&rsquo;s shoulder, his smile made more ominous by the
<em>saa</em>. The shorter man swallowed, and gave a wavering smile
in return. &ldquo;It is well you&rsquo;ve never considered how to remove
the Great Lord&rsquo;s shadow,&rdquo; Moridin said quietly. How long had
he been outside? Osan&rsquo;gar&rsquo;s smile grew even more sickly.
&ldquo;Al&rsquo;Thor is not as wise as you. Tell them, Cyndane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little woman drew herself up. By face and form
she was a luscious plum, ready for plucking, but her big blue eyes
were glacial. A peach, perhaps. Peaches were poisonous, here and
now. &ldquo;You recall the Choedan Kal, I suppose.&rdquo; No amount of effort
could make that low, breathy voice anything except sultry, but she
managed to inject sarcasm. &ldquo;Lews Therin has two of the access keys,
one for each. And he knows a woman strong enough to use the female
of the pair. He plans to use the Choedan Kal for his deed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nearly everyone began to talk at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought the keys were all destroyed!&rdquo;
Aran&rsquo;gar exclaimed, surging to her feet. Her eyes were wide
with fear. &ldquo;He could shatter the world just <em>trying</em> to use
the Choedan Kal!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you had ever read anything besides a history
book, you would know they&rsquo;re almost impossible to destroy!&rdquo;
Osan&rsquo;gar snarled at her. But he was tugging at his collar as
if it were too tight, and his eyes seemed ready to fall out of his
face. &ldquo;How can this girl know he has them? How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Graendal&rsquo;s wineglass had dropped from her hand
as soon the words were out of Cyndane&rsquo;s mouth, bouncing end
over end across the floor. Her gown turned as crimson as fresh
blood, and her mouth twisted as if she were going to vomit. &ldquo;And
you&rsquo;ve just been hoping to blunder into him!&rdquo; she screamed at
Demandred. &ldquo;Hoping someone will find him for you! Fool! Fool!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Demandred thought Graendal had been a touch
flamboyant even for her. He would wager the announcement had been
no surprise to her. It seemed she bore watching. He said
nothing.</p>

<p>Putting a hand over his heart, for all the world like
a lover, Moridin tilted up Cyndane&rsquo;s chin on his fingertips.
Resentment burned in her eyes, but her face might have been a
doll&rsquo;s unchanging face. She certainly accepted his attentions
like a pliable doll. &ldquo;Cyndane knows many things,&rdquo; Moridin said
softly, &ldquo;and she tells me everything she knows. Everything.&rdquo; The
tiny woman&rsquo;s expression never altered, but she trembled
visibly.</p>

<p>She was a puzzle to Demandred. At first he had
thought she was Lanfear reincarnated. Bodies for transmigration
supposedly were chosen by what was available, yet Osan&rsquo;gar and
Aran&rsquo;gar were proof of the Great Lord&rsquo;s cruel sense of
humor. He had been sure, until Mesaana told him the girl was weaker
than Lanfear. Mesaana and the rest thought she was of this Age. Yet
she spoke of al&rsquo;Thor as Lews Therin, just as Lanfear had, and
spoke of the Choedan Kal as one familiar with the terror they had
inspired during the War of Power. Only balefire had been more
feared, and only just. Or had Moridin taught her for purposes of
his own? If he had any real purposes. There had always been times
when the man&rsquo;s actions had been sheer madness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it seems he must be killed after all,&rdquo; Demandred
said. Hiding his satisfaction was not easy. Rand al&rsquo;Thor or
Lews Therin Telamon, he would rest easier when the fellow was dead.
&ldquo;Before he can destroy the world, and us. Which makes finding him
all the more urgent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Killed?&rdquo; Moridin moved his hands as though weighing
something. &ldquo;If it comes to that, yes,&rdquo; he said finally. &ldquo;But
finding him is no problem. When he touches the Choedan Kal, you
will know where he is. And you will go there and take him. Or kill
him, if necessary. The Nae&rsquo;blis has spoken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the Nae&rsquo;blis commands,&rdquo; Cyndane said
eagerly, bowing her head, and echoes of her ran around the room,
though Aran&rsquo;gar sounded sullen, Osan&rsquo;gar desperate, and
Graendal oddly thoughtful.</p>

<p>Bending his neck hurt Demandred as much as speaking
those words. So <em>they</em> would take al&rsquo;Thor&mdash;while
he was trying to use the Choedan Kal, no less, he and some woman
drinking enough of the One Power to melt continents!&mdash;but
there had been no indication that Moridin would be with them. Or
his twin pets, Moghedien and Cyndane. The man was Nae&rsquo;blis for
now, but perhaps matters could be arranged so he did not get
another body the next time he died. Perhaps it could be arranged
soon.</p>
