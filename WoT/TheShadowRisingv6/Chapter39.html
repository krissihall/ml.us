<h4><em>A Cup of Wine</em></h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen
Elayne came on deck with her things neatly
bundled, the setting sun seemed to be just touching the water out
beyond the mouth of Tanchico&rsquo;s harbor, and the final thick hawsers
were being tied to snug <em>Wavedancer</em> to a ship-lined dock,
only one of many along this westernmost peninsula of the city. Some
of the crew were furling the last sails. Beyond the long wharves
the city rose on hills, shining white, domed and spired, with
polished weather vanes glittering. Perhaps a mile north she could
make out high, round walls; the Great Circle, if she remembered
correctly.</p>

<p>Slinging her bundle on the same shoulder as her
leather script, she went to join Nynaeve by the gangplank, with
Coine and Jorin. It seemed almost odd to see the sisters fully
dressed again, in bright brocaded silk blouses that matched their
wide trousers. Earrings and even nose rings she had become used to,
and the fine gold chain across each woman&rsquo;s dark cheek hardly made
her wince at all now.</p>

<p>Thom and Juilin stood apart with their own bundles,
looking a touch sullen. Nynaeve had been right. They had tried to
second-guess, starting when the real purpose of this journey, or
some of it, was revealed to them two days ago. Neither seemed to
think two young women were competent&mdash;<em>competent!&mdash;</em>to seek the Black Ajah. A threat by Nynaeve to have
them transferred to another Sea Folk ship, headed the other way,
had nipped that in the bud. At least it had once Toram and a dozen
crewmen gathered ready to shove them into a boat to be rowed
across. Elayne gave them a searching look. Sullenness meant
rebellion; they were going to have more trouble from these two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where will you go now, Coine?&rdquo; Nynaeve was asking as
Elayne reached them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Dantora, and the Aile Jafar,&rdquo; the Sailmistress
replied, &ldquo;and then on to Cantorin and the Aile Somera, spreading
news of the Coramoor, if it pleases the Light. But I must allow
Toram to trade here, or he will burst.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her husband was down on the docks now, without his
strange wire-framed lens, bare-chested and be-ringed, talking
earnestly with men in baggy white trousers and coats embroidered
with scrollwork on the shoulders. Each Tanchican wore a dark,
cylindrical cap, and a transparent veil across his face. The veils
looked ridiculous, especially on the men with thick mustaches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light send you a safe voyage,&rdquo; Nynaeve said,
shifting her bundles on her back. &ldquo;If we discover any danger here
that might threaten you before you sail, we will send word.&rdquo; Coine
and her sister looked remarkably calm. Knowledge of the Black Ajah
hardly fazed them; it was the Coramoor, Rand, who was
important.</p>

<p>Jorin kissed her fingertips and pressed them to
Elayne&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;The Light willing, we shall meet again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light willing,&rdquo; Elayne responded, duplicating
the Windfinder&rsquo;s gesture. It still felt odd, but it was an honor,
too, used only between close family members or lovers. She was
going to miss the Sea Folk woman. She had learned a great deal, and
taught a little, as well. Jorin could certainly weave Fire much
better now.</p>

<p>When they reached the foot of the gangplank, Nynaeve
heaved a sigh of relief. An oily potion Jorin produced had settled
her stomach after two days at sea, but all the same she had been
tight-eyed and tight-mouthed until Tanchico came in sight.</p>

<p>The two men bracketed them immediately, without any
instructions, Juilin taking the lead with his bundle on his back
and his pale, thumb-thick staff held in both hands, dark eyes
alert. Thom brought up the rear, somehow managing a dangerous look
despite his white hair and his limp and his gleeman&rsquo;s cloak.</p>

<p>Nynaeve pursed her lips for a moment but said
nothing, which Elayne thought wise. Before they had gone fifty
paces down the long stone dock she had seen as many slitty-eyed,
hungry-faced men studying them, and Tanchicans and others shifting
crates and bales and sacks on the dock. She suspected any of them
would have been willing to cut her throat in the hope that a silk
dress meant money in her purse. They did not frighten her; she
could handle any two or three of them, she was sure. But she and
Nynaeve had their Great Serpent rings in their pouches, and it
would be useless to pretend no connection with the White Tower if
she channeled in front of a hundred men. Best if Juilin and Thom
looked as fierce as they could. She would not have minded having
ten more just like them.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a roar from the deck of one of the
smaller ships. &ldquo;You! It do be you!&rdquo; A wide, round-faced man in a
green silk coat leaped onto the dock, ignoring Juilin&rsquo;s raised
staff to stare at her and Nynaeve. A beard with no mustache marked
him as an Illianer, and so did his accent. He seemed vaguely
familiar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Domon?&rdquo; Nynaeve said after a moment, giving
her braid a sharp tug. &ldquo;Bayle Domon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He nodded. &ldquo;Aye. I did never think to see you again.
I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;did wait as long as I could in Falme, but the time did come
when I must sail or watch my ship burn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne knew him now. He had agreed to carry them out
of Falme, but chaos had seized that city before they could reach
his vessel. That coat said he had done well since.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pleasure to see you again,&rdquo; Nynaeve said coolly,
&ldquo;but if you will excuse us, we must find rooms in the city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will be hard. Tanchico do burst its caulking. I
do know a place where my word may bring something, though. I could
no remain longer in Falme, but I do feel I owe you some debt.&rdquo;
Domon paused, frowning with sudden unease. &ldquo;Your being here. Will
the same happen here as in Falme, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Master Domon,&rdquo; Elayne said when Nynaeve
hesitated. &ldquo;Of course not. And we will be glad to accept your
help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She half-expected some protest out of Nynaeve, yet
the older woman only nodded thoughtfully and made introductions
among the men. Thom&rsquo;s cloak made Domon&rsquo;s eyebrows rise&mdash;for
an instant she almost thought it looked as though he recognized the
gleeman&mdash;but Juilin&rsquo;s Tairen garb brought a frown that was
returned in kind. Neither man said anything, though; perhaps they
could keep the animosity between Tear and Illian out of Tanchico.
If they could not, she would have to speak firmly with them.</p>

<p>Domon talked of what had happened with him since
Falme as he accompanied them down the dock, and he had indeed done
well. &ldquo;A dozen good coasting ships the Panarch&rsquo;s taxmen do know
about,&rdquo; he laughed, &ldquo;and four deepwater they do no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He could hardly have acquired so many honestly in so
short a time. It shocked her to hear him speak so openly on a dock
full of men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, I do smuggle, and make such profits as I did
never believe. A tenth the amount of the excise in the customs
men&rsquo;s pockets do turn their eyes and seal their mouths.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two Tanchicans in those veils and round hats strolled
past, hands clasped behind their backs. Each wore a heavy brass key
dangling from a thick chain about his neck; it had the look of a
mark of office. They nodded to Domon in a familiar way. Thom looked
amused, but Juilin glared at Domon and the two Tanchicans equally.
As a thief-catcher he had a proper dislike of those who flouted the
law.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do no believe it will last much longer though,&rdquo;
Domon said when the Tanchicans had passed. &ldquo;Things do be even worse
in Arad Doman than here, and it do be bad enough here. Perhaps the
Lord Dragon does no Break the World yet, but he did break Arad
Doman and Tarabon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne wanted to say something sharp to him, but they
had reached the foot of the dock, and she watched in silence while
he hired sedan chairs and bearers, and a dozen men with stout
staves and hard faces. Guards with swords and spears stood at the
end of the dock, with the look of hired men, not soldiers. From
across the wide street along the row of docks, hundreds of
defeated, sunken faces stared at the guards. Sometimes eyes
flickered toward the ships, but mainly they fixed on the men
holding them back from those ships. Remembering what Coine had said
about people here mobbing her vessel, desperate to buy passage
anywhere away from Tanchico, Elayne shivered. When these hungry
eyes looked at the ships, need burned in them. Elayne sat rigidly
in her chair as it jounced through the crowds behind prodding
staves, and tried not to look at anything. She did not want to see
those faces. Where was their king? Why was he not taking care of
them?</p>

<p>A sign above the gate of the white-plastered inn
Domon took them to, below the Great Circle, proclaimed the Three
Plum Court. The only court Elayne saw was the high-walled courtyard
paved with flagstones in front of the inn, which was three square
stories with no windows near the ground and the upper windows
grilled with fanciful ironwork. Inside, men and women crowded the
common room, most in Tanchican clothes, and the buzz of voices
nearly drowned out the tune of a hammered dulcimer.</p>

<p>Nynaeve gasped at her first sight of the innkeeper, a
pretty woman not much older than herself with brown eyes and pale
honey braids, her veil not hiding a plump rosebud of a mouth.
Elayne gave a start, too, but it was not Liandrin. The woman&mdash;her name was Rendra&mdash;obviously knew Domon well. With
welcoming smiles for Elayne and Nynaeve, and making much over Thom
being a gleeman, she gave them her last two rooms at what Elayne
suspected might be less than the going rate. Elayne made sure she
and Nynaeve got the one with the larger bed; she had shared a bed
with Nynaeve before, and the woman was free with her elbows.</p>

<p>Rendra also provided supper in a private room, laid
out by two veiled young serving men. Elayne found herself staring
at a plate of a roast lamb with spiced apple jelly and some sort of
long yellowish beans prepared with pinenuts. She could not touch
it. All those hungry faces. Domon ate readily enough, him and his
smuggling and his gold. Thom and Juilin showed no reticence
either.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rendra,&rdquo; Nynaeve said quietly, &ldquo;does anyone here
help the poor? I can lay my hands on a good bit of gold if it would
help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could donate to Bayle&rsquo;s kitchen,&rdquo; the innkeeper
replied, giving Domon a smile. &ldquo;The man avoids all of the taxes,
yet he taxes himself. For each crown he gives as the bribe, he
gives two for the soup and the bread for the poor. He has even
talked me into giving, and <em>I</em> pay my taxes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It do be less than the taxes,&rdquo; Domon muttered,
hunching his shoulders defensively. &ldquo;I do make a very healthy
profit, Fortune prick me if I do no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is good that you like to help people, Master
Domon,&rdquo; Nynaeve said when Rendra and the servants had gone. Thom
and Juilin both got up to see they really had gone. With a
half-bow, Thom let Juilin open the door; the hall outside was
empty. Nynaeve went right on. &ldquo;We may need your help, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Illianer&rsquo;s knife and fork paused in cutting a
piece of lamb. &ldquo;How?&rdquo; he asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know exactly, Master Domon. You have ships.
You must have men. We may need ears and eyes. Some of the Black
Ajah may very well be in Tanchico, and we must find them if they
are.&rdquo; Nynaeve lifted a forkful of beans to her mouth as if she had
said nothing out of the ordinary. She seemed to be telling everyone
about the Black Ajah of late.</p>

<p>Domon gaped at her, then stared incredulously at Thom
and Juilin as they settled back in their chairs. When they nodded,
he pushed his plate aside and put his head down on his arms. He
very nearly earned himself a thump from Nynaeve, if the way her
mouth tightened was any indication, and Elayne would not have
blamed her. Why should he need them to confirm her word?</p>

<p>Finally Domon roused himself. &ldquo;It do be going to
happen again. Falme all over. Maybe it do be time for me to pack up
and go. If I do take the ships I have back to Illian, I will be a
wealthy man there, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt you&rsquo;d find Illian congenial,&rdquo; Nynaeve told
him in a firm voice. &ldquo;I understand that Sammael rules there now, if
not openly. You might not enjoy your wealth under one of the
Forsaken.&rdquo; Domon&rsquo;s eyes nearly came out of his head, but she went
right on. &ldquo;There are no safe places any longer. You can run like a
rabbit, but you cannot hide. Is it not better to do what you can to
fight back like a man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve was being too hard; she always had to bully
people. Elayne smiled and leaned over to put a hand on Domon&rsquo;s arm.
&ldquo;We do not mean to browbeat you, Master Domon, but we truly may
need your help. I know you for a brave man, else you would not have
waited for us as long as you did at Falme. We will be most
grateful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do this very well,&rdquo; Domon muttered. &ldquo;One with an
ox driver&rsquo;s stick, the other with a queen&rsquo;s honey. Oh, very well. I
will help as I can. But I will no promise to remain for another
Falme.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom and Juilin set in to question him closely about
Tanchico as they ate. At least, Juilin did in a roundabout manner,
suggesting questions to Thom about what districts thieves and
cutpurses and burglars frequented, what wineshops they used, and
who bought their stolen goods. The thief-catcher maintained that
such people often knew more of what was going on in a city than the
authorities did. He did not seem to want to talk to the Illianer
directly, and Domon snorted every time he answered one of the
Tairen&rsquo;s questions put by Thom. He did not answer <em>until</em>
they were put by Thom. Thom&rsquo;s own questions made no sense, at least
not coming from a gleeman. He asked of nobles and factions, of who
was allied to whom and who opposed, of who had what stated aims,
and what their actions brought about, and whether the results were
different from what they supposedly wanted. Not the kind of
questions she expected from him at all, even after all their
conversations on <em>Wavedancer</em>. He had been willing enough to
talk with her&mdash;he even seemed to enjoy it&mdash;but somehow
every time she thought she might dig out something about his past,
that was just when he managed to put her back up and send her
stalking away. Domon answered Thom with more alacrity than he did
Juilin. In either case, though, he seemed to know Tanchico very
well, both its lords and officials and its dark underbelly; as he
talked, it often sounded as if there were little difference.</p>

<p>Once the two men had wrung the smuggler dry, Nynaeve
summoned Rendra to bring pen and ink and paper, and wrote out a
list describing each of the Black sisters. Holding the sheets
gingerly in one big hand, Domon frowned at them uneasily, as though
they were the women themselves, but he promised to have such of his
men as were in port keep their eyes open. When Nynaeve reminded him
that they all should take extreme care, he laughed the way he would
had she told him not to run himself through with a sword.</p>

<p>Juilin left on Domon&rsquo;s heels, twirling his pale staff
and saying night was the best time to find thieves and people who
lived off thieves. Nynaeve announced she was retiring to her room&mdash;<em>her</em> room&mdash;to lie down awhile. She looked a
bit unsteady, and suddenly Elayne realized why. Nynaeve had become
used to <em>Wavedancer&rsquo;</em>s heaving; now she was having trouble
with the ground <em>not</em> heaving. The woman&rsquo;s stomach was not a
pleasant traveling companion.</p>

<p>She herself followed Thom down to the common room,
where he had promised Rendra he would perform. For a wonder she
found a bench at an empty table, and cool looks sufficed to ward
off the men who suddenly seemed to want to sit there. Rendra
brought her a silver cup of wine, and she sipped as she listened to
Thom play his harp, singing love songs like &ldquo;The First Rose of
Summer&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Wind That Shakes the Willow,&rdquo; and funny songs like
&ldquo;Only One Boot&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Old Gray Goose.&rdquo; His listeners were
appreciative, slapping the tables for applause. After a while
Elayne slapped hers, too. She had not drunk more than half her
wine, but a handsome young serving man smiled at her and filled it
up. It was all strangely exciting. In her whole life she had not
been in an inn&rsquo;s common room half a dozen times, and never to sip
wine and be entertained like one of the common people.</p>

<p>Flourishing his cloak to set the multihued patches
fluttering, Thom told stories&mdash;&rdquo;Mara and the Three Foolish
Kings,&rdquo; and several tales about Anla, the Wise Counselor&mdash;and
recited a long stretch of <em>The Great Hunt of the Horn</em>,
reciting it so that horses seemed to prance and trumpets blare in
the common room, and men and women fought and loved and died. On
into the night he sang and recited, only pausing now and then to
wet his throat with a sip of wine as the patrons eagerly clamored
for more. The woman who had been playing the dulcimer sat in a
corner with her instrument on her knees and a sour expression on
her face. People often tossed coins to Thom&mdash;he had enlisted
a small boy to gather them up&mdash;and it was unlikely they had
produced as much for her music.</p>

<p>It all seemed to suit Thom, the harp, and especially
the recital. Well, he was a gleeman, but it seemed more than that.
Elayne could have sworn she had heard him recite <em>The Great
Hunt</em> before, but in High Chant, not Plain. How could that be?
He was just a simple old gleeman.</p>

<p>Finally, in the deep hours of the night, Thom bowed
with a last sweeping flourish of his cloak and headed for the
stairs amid great slapping of tables. Elayne slapped hers as
vigorously as anyone.</p>

<p>Rising to follow, she slipped and sat back down hard,
frowning at her silver winecup. It was full. Surely she had drunk a
little. She felt dizzy for some reason. Yes. That sweet young man
with those melting brown eyes had refilled her cup&mdash;how many
times? Not that it mattered. She never drank more than one cup of
wine. Never. It was being off <em>Wavedancer</em> and back on dry
land. She was reacting like Nynaeve. That was all.</p>

<p>Getting carefully to her feet&mdash;and refusing the
sweet young man&rsquo;s most solicitous offer of help&mdash;she managed
to climb the stairs despite the way they swayed. Not stopping at
the second floor, where her and Nynaeve&rsquo;s room was, she went up to
the third and knocked on Thom&rsquo;s door. He opened it slowly, peering
out suspiciously. He seemed to have a knife in his hand, and then
it was gone. Strange. She seized one of his long white
mustaches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; she said. Her tongue did not seem to be
working properly; the words sounded&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;fuzzy. &ldquo;I was sitting on
your knee, and I pulled your mustache&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She gave it a yank to
demonstrate, and he winced. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and my mother leaned over your
shoulder and laughed at me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it best you go to your room,&rdquo; he said,
trying to pry her hand free. &ldquo;I think you need some sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She refused to let go. In fact, she seemed to have
pushed him back into his room. By his mustache. &ldquo;My mother sat on
your knee, too. I saw it. I remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sleep is the thing, Elayne. You will feel better in
the morning.&rdquo; He managed to get her hand loose and tried ushering
her to the door, but she slipped around him. The bed had no posts.
If she had a bedpost to hold on to, perhaps the room would stop
tilting back and forth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to know why Mother sat on your knee.&rdquo; He
stepped back, and she realized she was reaching for his mustache
again. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a gleeman. My mother would not sit on a gleeman&rsquo;s
knee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go to bed, child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am <em>not</em> a child!&rdquo; She stamped her foot
angrily, and almost fell. The floor was lower than it looked. &ldquo;Not
a child. You will tell me. Now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom sighed and shook his head. At last he said
stiffly, &ldquo;I was not always a gleeman. I was a bard, once. A
Court-bard. In Caemlyn, as it happens. For Queen Morgase. You were
a child. You are just remembering things wrong, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were her lover, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; The flinch of his
eyes was enough. &ldquo;You were! I always knew about Gareth Bryne. At
least, I figured it out. But I always hoped she would marry him.
Gareth Bryne, and you, and this Lord Gaebril Mat said she looks
calf-eyes at now, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;How many more? How many? What makes her
any different from Berelain, tripping every man who catches her eye
into her bed. She is no different&mdash;&rdquo; Her vision shivered, and
her head rang. It took her a moment to realize he had slapped her.
<em>Slapped</em> her! She drew herself up, wishing he would not
sway. &ldquo;How dare you? I am Daughter-Heir of Andor, and I will not be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a little girl with a skinful of wine
throwing a temper tantrum,&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;And if I ever hear you say
anything like that about Morgase again, drunk or sober, I&rsquo;ll put
you over my knee however you channel! Morgase is a fine woman, as
good as any there is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she?&rdquo; Her voice quavered, and she realized she
was crying. &ldquo;Then why did she&mdash;? Why&mdash;?&rdquo; Somehow she had
her face buried against his coat, and he was smoothing her
hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because it is lonely being a queen,&rdquo; he said softly.
&ldquo;Because most men attracted to a queen see power, not a woman. I
saw a woman, and she knew it. I suppose Bryne saw the same in her,
and this Gaebril, too. You have to understand, child. Everyone
wants someone in their life, someone who cares for them, someone
they can care for. Even a queen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you go away?&rdquo; she mumbled into his chest.
&ldquo;You made me laugh. I remember that. You made her laugh, too. And
you rode me on your shoulder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A long story.&rdquo; He sighed painfully. &ldquo;I will tell you
another time. If you ask. With luck, you&rsquo;ll forget this by morning.
It&rsquo;s time for you to go to bed, Elayne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He guided her to the door, and she took the
opportunity to tug at his mustache again. &ldquo;Like that,&rdquo; she said
with satisfaction. &ldquo;I used to pull it just like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you did. Can you make it downstairs by
yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I can.&rdquo; She gave him her haughtiest stare,
but he looked readier than ever to follow her into the hall. To
prove there was no need, she walked&mdash;carefully&mdash;as far
as the head of the stairs. He was still frowning at her worriedly
from the doorway when she started down.</p>

<p>Luckily she did not stumble until she was out of his
sight, but she did walk right by her door and had to come back.
Something must have been wrong with that apple jelly; she knew she
should not have eaten so much of it. Lini always said&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She
could not remember what it was Lini said, but something about
eating too many sweets.</p>

<p>There were two lamps burning in the room, one on the
small round table by the bed and the other on the white-plastered
mantel above the brick fireplace. Nynaeve lay stretched out on the
bed atop the coverlet, fully dressed. With her elbows stuck out,
Elayne noted.</p>

<p>She said the first thing that came into her head.
&ldquo;Rand must think I&rsquo;m crazy, Thom is a bard, and Berelain isn&rsquo;t my
mother after all.&rdquo; Nynaeve gave her the oddest look. &ldquo;I am a little
dizzy for some reason. A nice boy with sweet brown eyes offered to
help me upstairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will wager he did,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, biting off each
word. Rising, she came to put an arm around Elayne&rsquo;s shoulders.
&ldquo;Come over here a moment. There&rsquo;s something I think you should
see.&rdquo; It appeared to be a bucket of extra water by the washstand.
&ldquo;Here. We&rsquo;ll both kneel down so you can look.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne did, but there was nothing in the bucket but
her own reflection in the water, She wondered why she was grinning
that way. Then Nynaeve&rsquo;s hand went to the back of her neck, and her
head was in the water.</p>

<p>Flailing her hands, she tried to straighten up, but
Nynaeve&rsquo;s arm was like an iron bar. You were supposed to hold your
breath under water. Elayne knew you were. She just could not
remember how. All she could do was flail and gurgle and choke.</p>

<p>Nynaeve hauled her up, water streaming down her face,
and she filled her lungs. &ldquo;How dare&mdash;you,&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;I am&mdash;the Daughter-Heir of&mdash;&rdquo; She managed to get out one wail
before her head went back in with a splash. Seizing the bucket with
both hands and pushing did no good. Drumming her feet on the floor
did no good. She was going to drown. Nynaeve was going to drown
her.</p>

<p>After an Age she was back out in the air again.
Sodden strands of hair hung all across her face. &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she
said in the steadiest voice she could find, &ldquo;that I am going to
sick up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve got the big white-glazed basin down from the
washstand just in time, and held Elayne&rsquo;s head while she brought
up everything she had ever eaten in her life. A year later&mdash;well, hours anyway; it seemed that long&mdash;Nynaeve was washing
her face and wiping her mouth, bathing her hands and wrists. There
was nothing solicitous in her voice, though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could you do this? Whatever possessed you? I
might expect a fool man to drink until he can&rsquo;t stand, but you! And
tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only had one cup,&rdquo; Elayne muttered. Even with that
young man refilling it, she could not have had more than two.
Surely not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A cup the size of a pitcher.&rdquo; Nynaeve sniffed,
helping her to her feet. Hauling her, really. &ldquo;Can you stay awake?
I am going to look for Egwene, and I still don&rsquo;t trust myself to
get out of <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> without someone to wake me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne blinked at her. They had looked for Egwene,
unsuccessfully, every night since she had disappeared so abruptly
out of that meeting in the Heart of the Stone. &ldquo;Stay awake?
Nynaeve, it is my turn to look, and better it&rsquo;s me. You know you
cannot channel unless you are angry, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She realized the
other woman was surrounded by the glow of <em>saidar</em>. And had
been for some time, she thought. Her own head felt stuffed full of
wool; thought had to burrow through. She could barely sense the
True Source. &ldquo;Maybe you had better go. I will stay awake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve frowned at her, but finally nodded. Elayne
tried to help undress her, but her fingers did not seem to work
very well when it came to those little buttons. Grumping under her
breath, Nynaeve managed on her own. In only her shift, she threaded
the twisted stone ring onto the leather cord she wore hanging
around her neck, alongside a man&rsquo;s ring, heavy and golden. That was
Lan&rsquo;s ring; Nynaeve always wore it between her breasts.</p>

<p>Elayne pulled a low wooden stool over beside the bed
while Nynaeve stretched out again. She did feel rather sleepy, but
she would not fall asleep sitting on that. The problem seemed to be
not falling on the floor. &ldquo;I will judge an hour and wake you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve nodded, then closed her eyes, both hands
clutched around the two rings. After a time her breathing
deepened.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The Heart of the Stone was quite empty. Peering into
the dimness among the great columns, Nynaeve had circled <em>
Callandor</em>, sparkling out of the floorstones, completely before
she realized she was still in her shift, the leather cord dangling
about her neck with the two rings. She frowned, and after a moment
she was wearing a Two Rivers dress of good brown wool, and stout
shoes. Elayne and Egwene both seemed to find this sort of thing
easy, but it was not easy for her. There had been embarrassing
moments in earlier visits to <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, mostly after
stray thoughts of Lan, but changing her garb deliberately took
concentration. Just that&mdash;remembering&mdash;and her dress
was silk, and as transparent as Rendra&rsquo;s veil. Berelain would have
blushed. So did Nynaeve, thinking of Lan seeing her in it. It took
an effort to bring the brown wool back.</p>

<p>Worse, her anger had faded&mdash;that fool girl; did
she not realize what happened when you drank too much wine? Had she
never been alone in a common room before? Well, possibly she had
not&mdash;and the True Source might as well not exist so far as
she was concerned. Perhaps it would not matter. Uneasy, she stared
into the forest of huge redstone columns, turning in one spot. What
had made Egwene leave here abruptly?</p>

<p>The Stone was silent, with a hollow emptiness. She
could hear the blood rushing in her own ears. Yet the skin between
her shoulder blades prickled as if someone were watching her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egwene?&rdquo; Her shout echoed in the silence among the
columns. &ldquo;Egwene?&rdquo; Nothing.</p>

<p>Rubbing her hands on her skirt, she found she was
holding a gnarled stick with a thick knob on the end. A fat lot of
good that would do. But she tightened her grip on it. A sword might
be more use&mdash;for an instant the stick flickered, half a sword&mdash;but she did not know how to use a sword. She laughed to
herself ruefully. A cudgel was as good as a sword here; both
practically useless. Channeling was the only real defense, that and
running. Which left her only one choice at the moment.</p>

<p>She wanted to run now, with that feel of eyes on her,
but she would not give up so quickly. Only what was she to do?
Egwene was not here. She was somewhere in the Waste. Rhuidean,
Elayne said. Wherever that was.</p>

<p>Between one step and the next she was suddenly on a
mountainside, with a harsh sun rising over more jagged mountains
beyond the valley below, baking the dry air. The Waste. She was in
the Waste. For a moment the sun startled her, but the Waste was far
enough east for sunrise there to still be night in Tanchico. In
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> it made no difference anyway. Sunlight or
darkness there seemed to bear no relation to what was in the real
world as far as she could determine.</p>

<p>Long, pale shadows still covered almost half the
valley, but strangely a mass of fog billowed down there, not
seeming to grow less for the sun beating on it. Great towers rose
out of the fog, some appearing unfinished. A city. In the
Waste?</p>

<p>Squinting, she could make out a person down in the
valley, too. A man, though all she could see at this distance was
someone who seemed to be wearing breeches and a bright blue coat.
Certainly not an Aiel. He was walking along the edge of the fog,
every now and again stopping to poke at it. She could not be sure,
but she thought his hand stopped short each time. Maybe it was not
fog at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must get away from here,&rdquo; a woman&rsquo;s voice said
urgently. &ldquo;If that one sees you, you are dead, or worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve jumped, spinning with her club raised, nearly
losing her footing on the slope.</p>

<p>The woman standing a little above her wore a short
white coat and voluminous, pale yellow trousers gathered above
short boots. Her cloak billowed on an arid gust of wind. It was her
long golden hair, intricately braided, and the silver bow in her
hands that made a name pop incredulously into Nynaeve&rsquo;s mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Birgitte?</em>&rdquo; Birgitte, hero of a hundred
tales, and her silver bow with which she never missed. Birgitte,
one of the dead heroes the Horn of Valere would call back
from the grave to fight in the Last Battle. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible. Who
are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no time, woman. You must go before he
sees.&rdquo; In one smooth motion she pulled a silver arrow from the
quiver at her waist, nocked it and drew fletching to ear. The
silver arrowhead pointed straight at Nynaeve&rsquo;s heart. &ldquo;Go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve fled.</p>

<p>She was not sure how, but she was standing on the
Green in Emond&rsquo;s Field, looking at the Winespring Inn with its
chimneys and red tile roof. Thatched roofs surrounded the Green,
where the Winespring gushed out of a stone outcrop. The sun stood
high here, though the Two Rivers lay far west of the Waste. Yet
despite a cloudless sky, a deep shadow lay across the village.</p>

<p>She had only a moment to wonder how they were doing
without her. A flicker of movement caught her eye, a flash of
silver and a woman, ducking behind the corner of Ailys Candwin&rsquo;s
neat house beyond the Winespring Water. Birgitte.</p>

<p>Nynaeve did not hesitate. She ran for one of the
footbridges across the narrow rushing stream. Her shoes pounded on
the wooden planks. &ldquo;Come back here,&rdquo; she shouted. &ldquo;You come back
here and answer me! Who was that? You come back here, or I&rsquo;ll hero
you! I&rsquo;ll thump you so you think you&rsquo;ve had an adventure!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rounding the corner of Ailys&rsquo;s house, she really only
half-expected to see Birgitte. What she did not expect at all was a
man in a dark coat trotting toward her less than a hundred paces
down the hard-packed dirt street. Her breath caught. Lan. No, but
he had the same shape to his face, the same eyes. Halting, he
raised his bow and shot. At her. Screaming, she threw herself aside
trying to claw her way awake.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Elayne jumped to her feet, toppling the stool over
backward, as Nynaeve screamed and sat up on the bed, eyes wide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happened, Nynaeve? What happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve shuddered. &ldquo;He looked like Lan. He looked
like Lan, and he tried to kill me.&rdquo; She put a trembling hand to her
left arm, where a shallow slash oozed blood a few inches below her
shoulder. &ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t jumped, it would have gone through my
heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seating herself on the edge of the bed, Elayne
examined the cut. &ldquo;It is not bad. I&rsquo;ll wash and bandage it for
you.&rdquo; She wished she knew how to Heal; trying without knowing might
well make it worse. But it really was little more than a long nick.
Not to mention that her head still seemed full of jelly. Quivering
jelly. &ldquo;It was not Lan. Calm yourself. Whoever it was, it was not
Lan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; Nynaeve said acidly. She recounted
what had happened in much the same angry voice. The man who had
shot at her in Emond&rsquo;s Field, and the man in the Waste; she was not
sure they were one and the same. Birgitte herself was incredible
enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you certain?&rdquo; Elayne asked. &ldquo;Birgitte?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve sighed. &ldquo;The only thing I am certain of is
that I did not find Egwene. And that I am not going back there
tonight.&rdquo; She pounded a fist on her thigh. &ldquo;Where is she? What
happened to her? If she met that fellow with the bow&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Oh,
Light!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne had to think a minute; she wanted to sleep so
badly, and her thoughts kept shimmering. &ldquo;She said she might not be
there when we are supposed to meet again. Maybe that is why she
left so hurriedly. Whyever she can&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; It did not
seem to make a great deal of sense, but she could not get it out
properly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; Nynaeve said wearily. Looking at Elayne,
she added, &ldquo;We had better get you to bed. You look ready to fall
over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne was grateful to be helped out of her clothes.
She did remember to bandage Nynaeve&rsquo;s arm, but the bed looked so
inviting she could hardly think of anything else. In the morning
perhaps the room would have stopped its slow spin around the bed.
Sleep came as soon as her head touched the pillow.</p>

<p>In the morning she wished she were dead.</p>

<p>With sunlight barely in the sky, the common room was
empty except for Elayne. Head in her hands, she stared at a cup
Nynaeve had set on the table before going off to find the
innkeeper. Every time she breathed, she could smell it; her nose
tried to clench. Her head felt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;It was not possible to
describe how her head felt. Had someone offered to cut it off, she
might have thanked him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She jerked at the sound of Thom&rsquo;s voice and barely
stifled a whimper. &ldquo;I am quite all right, thank you.&rdquo; Talking made
her head throb. He fiddled with one of his mustaches uncertainly.
&ldquo;Your stories were wonderful last night, Thom. What I remember of
them.&rdquo; Somehow she managed a small, self-deprecating laugh. &ldquo;I am
afraid I don&rsquo;t remember very much of anything except sitting there
listening. I seem to have eaten some bad apple jelly.&rdquo; She was not
about to admit to drinking all that wine; she still had no idea how
much. Or to making a fool of herself in his room. Above all, not
that. He seemed to believe her, from the relieved way he took a
chair.</p>

<p>Nynaeve appeared, handing her a damp cloth as she sat
down. She also pushed the cup with its horrible brew closer. Elayne
pressed the cloth to her forehead gratefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have either of you seen Master Sandar this morning?&rdquo;
the older woman asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did not sleep in our room,&rdquo; Thom replied. &ldquo;Which
I should be grateful for, considering the size of the bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As though the words had summoned him, Juilin came in
through the front door, his face weary and his snug-fitting coat
rumpled. There was a bruise beneath his left eye, and the short
black hair that normally lay flat on his head looked rough-combed
with his fingers, but he smiled as he joined them. &ldquo;The thieves in
this city are as numerous as minnows in reeds, and they will talk
if you buy a cup of something. I have talked with two men who claim
to have seen a woman with a white streak in her hair above the left
ear. I think I believe one of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So they are here,&rdquo; Elayne said, but Nynaeve shook
her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. More than one woman can have a white streak
in her hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He could not say how old she was,&rdquo; Juilin said,
hiding a yawn behind his hand. &ldquo;No age at all, he claimed. He joked
that maybe she was Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go too fast,&rdquo; Nynaeve told him in a tight voice.
&ldquo;You do us no good if you bring them down on us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Juilin flushed darkly. &ldquo;I am careful. I have no wish
for Liandrin to put her hands on me again. I do not ask questions;
I talk. Sometimes of women I used to know. Two men bit on that
white streak, and neither ever knew it was more than a scrap of
idle talk over cheap ale. Tonight maybe another will swim into my
net, only this time maybe it will be a fragile woman from Cairhien
with very big blue eyes.&rdquo; That would be Temaile Kinderode. &ldquo;Bit by
bit, I will narrow where they have been seen, until I know where
they are. I will find them for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or I will.&rdquo; Thom sounded as if he thought that much
more likely. &ldquo;Rather than thieves, would they not be meddling with
nobles and politics? Some lord in this city will begin doing what
he usually does not, and he will draw me to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two men eyed one another. In another moment
Elayne expected one of them to offer to wrestle. Men. First Juilin
and Domon, now Juilin and Thom. Very likely Thom and Domon would
get in a fistfight to complete it. Men. That was the only comment
she could think of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Elayne and I will succeed without either of
you,&rdquo; Nynaeve said dryly. &ldquo;We will begin looking ourselves, today.&rdquo;
Her eyes barely shifted toward Elayne. &ldquo;At least, I will. Elayne
may need a little more rest to recover from&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the voyage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Setting the cloth down carefully, Elayne used both
hands to pick up the cup in front of her. The thick, gray-green
liquid tasted worse than it smelled. Shuddering, she made herself
keep swallowing. When it hit her stomach, for an instant she felt
like a cloak snapping in a high wind. &ldquo;Two pairs of eyes can see
better than one,&rdquo; she told Nynaeve, setting the empty cup back down
with a clink.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A hundred pairs can see even better,&rdquo; Juilin said
hastily, &ldquo;and if that Illianer eel truly sends his people out, we
will have at least that many, what with the thieves and
cutpurses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;<em>we</em>&mdash;will find these women
for you if they can be found,&rdquo; Thom said. &ldquo;There is no need for you
to stir from the inn. This city has a dangerous feel even if
Liandrin is not here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Besides which,&rdquo; Juilin added, &ldquo;if they are here,
they know the two of you. They know your faces. Much better if you
stay here at the inn, out of sight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne stared at them in amazement. A moment gone
they had been trying to stare each other down, and now they were
shoulder to shoulder. Nynaeve had been right about them causing
trouble. Well, the Daughter-Heir of Andor was not about to hide
behind Master Juilin Sandar and Master Thom Merrilin. She opened
her mouth to tell them so, but Nynaeve spoke first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; she said calmly. Elayne stared at
her incredulously; Thom and Juilin looked surprised, and at the
same time disgustingly satisfied. &ldquo;They do know us,&rdquo; Nynaeve went
on. &ldquo;I took care of that this morning, I think. Ah, here is
Mistress Rendra with our breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom and Juilin exchanged disconcerted frowns, but
they could say nothing with the innkeeper smiling at them all
through her veil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About what I asked you?&rdquo; Nynaeve said to her as the
woman placed a bowl of honeyed porridge in front of her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes. It will be no problem to find the clothes
to fit both of you. And the hair&mdash;you have such lovely hair;
so long&mdash;it will be the work of no time to put it up.&rdquo; She
fingered her own deep golden braids.</p>

<p>Thom&rsquo;s and Juilin&rsquo;s faces made Elayne smile. They
might have been ready for arguments; they had no defense against
being ignored. Her head was actually feeling a little better;
Nynaeve&rsquo;s vile mixture seemed to be working. As Nynaeve and Rendra
discussed costs and cut and fabric&mdash;Rendra wanted to
duplicate her clinging dress, pale green today; Nynaeve was
opposed, but seemed to be wavering&mdash;Elayne took a spoon of
porridge to wash the taste from her mouth. It reminded her that she
was hungry.</p>

<p>There was one problem none of them had mentioned yet,
one that Thom and Juilin did not know. If the Black Ajah was in
Tanchico, then so was whatever it was that endangered Rand.
Something able to bind him with his own Power. Finding Liandrin and
the others was not enough. They had to find that, too. Suddenly her
newfound appetite was completely gone.</p>
