<h4><em>Into the Deep</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">S</span>ervants
boiled along the halls as Nynaeve ran,
shouting frantic questions. They might not be able to sense
channeling, but they had certainly felt the palace being torn half
apart. She threaded her way through, just one more serving woman in
a panic as far as they were concerned.</p>

<p><em>Saidar</em> faded from her as she sped down
corridors and across courtyards. Holding on to anger was difficult
when she was increasingly uneasy for Elayne. If the Black sisters
had found her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Who knew what they had beside the balefire
<em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>? The list they had been given certainly did not
give a use for everything.</p>

<p>Once she saw Liandrin, with her pale honey braids,
and Rianna, with that white streak in her black hair, hurrying down
a flight of broad marble stairs; she could not see the glow of
<em>saidar</em> around them, but from the way servants cried out
and leaped from their path, they were whipping a way clear for
themselves with the Power. It made her glad she had not tried to
cling to the Source herself; they would have picked her out of the
throng in an instant by the glow, and until she had some rest, she
was not up to facing either of them, much less both. She had what
she had come for. They had to wait.</p>

<p>The crowd thinned and disappeared by the time she
reached the narrow hall on the west side of the palace that was the
meeting place. The others were waiting for her beside a small,
bronze-studded door fastened with a large iron lock. Including
Amathera, standing very straight, wearing a light linen cloak with
the hood up. The Panarch&rsquo;s white dress might pass for serving-woman
garb if you did not look closely enough to see it was silk, and the
veil that did not hide her face was certainly servant&rsquo;s linen. The
sound of shouts came muffled through the door. Apparently the riot
was still going on. Now if only the men were doing the rest of
their part.</p>

<p>Ignoring Egeanin, Nynaeve threw her arms around
Elayne in a quick hug. &ldquo;I was so worried. Did you have any
trouble?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; Elayne replied. Egeanin shifted
slightly, and the younger woman gave her a meaningful look, then
added, &ldquo;Amathera did cause a little problem, but we sorted it
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve frowned. &ldquo;Trouble? Why would she give
trouble? Why would you give trouble?&rdquo; That last was for the
Panarch, who held her head high, refusing to look at anyone. Elayne
seemed as reluctant.</p>

<p>It was the Seanchan woman who answered. &ldquo;She tried to
sneak off to rouse her soldiers to harry the Darkfriends out. After
she had been warned.&rdquo; Nynaeve refused to look at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not scowl so, Nynaeve,&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;I chased
her down quickly, and we had a little talk. I think she is in
perfect agreement with me now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Panarch&rsquo;s cheek twitched, &ldquo;I am in agreement, Aes
Sedai,&rdquo; she said hastily. &ldquo;I will do exactly as you say, and I will
provide papers that should make even the rebels let you pass
unhindered. There is no need for more&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;talking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne nodded as if all of that made sense, motioning
for the women to be quiet. Whereupon the Panarch obediently closed
her mouth. A trifle sullenly, but perhaps that was just the shape
of her mouth. Clearly there had been some very odd goings on, and
Nynaeve intended to find the bottom of them. Later. The narrow
hallway was still empty in both directions, but panicked shouts
still echoed from deeper in the palace. The mob rumbled beyond the
small door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what of you?&rdquo; Elayne went on with a frown. &ldquo;You
were supposed to be here half an hour ago. Did you cause all of
this? I felt two women channeling enough of the Power to shake the
palace down, and then a bit later someone did try to shake it down.
I thought it must be you. I had to restrain Egeanin from going to
find you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egeanin? Nynaeve hesitated, then made herself touch
the Seanchan woman&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Egeanin looked as
though she did not quite understand herself what she had done, but
she gave a quick nod. &ldquo;Moghedien found me, and because I was
worrying about how to bring her out for trial, Jeaine Caide nearly
took my head off with balefire.&rdquo; Elayne gave a small squeak, and
she hurried to reassure her. &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t really come close to
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You <em>captured</em> Moghedien? You captured one of
the <em>Forsaken</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but she got away.&rdquo; There. She had admitted
everything. Conscious of all their eyes on her, she shifted
uncomfortably. She did not like being in the wrong. She especially
did not like being in the wrong when it was she who had pointed out
that it was wrong in the first place. &ldquo;Elayne, I know what I said
about being careful, but once I had her in my hands, it seemed all
I could think of was bringing her to trial.&rdquo; Taking a deep breath,
Nynaeve made her voice apologetic. She hated doing that. Where were
those fool men? &ldquo;I endangered everything because I didn&rsquo;t keep my
mind on what we were about, but please don&rsquo;t scold me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Elayne said firmly. &ldquo;So long as you
remember to be careful in the future.&rdquo; Egeanin cleared her throat.
&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; Elayne added hastily. The waiting seemed to be getting
to her; there were spots of color in her cheeks. &ldquo;Did you find the
collar, and the seal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have them.&rdquo; She patted her pouch. The shouting
outside seemed to be getting louder. And the shouts echoing down
the halls were, too. Liandrin must be turning the palace upside
down to find out what had happened. &ldquo;What is keeping those
men?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Legion,&rdquo; Amathera began. Elayne looked at her,
and she snapped her mouth shut. Whatever talk they had had must
have been something. The Panarch was pouting like a girl afraid of
being sent to bed without supper.</p>

<p>Nynaeve glanced at Egeanin. The Seanchan woman was
watching the door intently. She had wanted to come after her.
<em>Why won&rsquo;t she let me hate her? Am I so different from
her?</em></p>

<p>Suddenly the door swung open. Juilin pulled two thin
bent metal rods out of the lock and straightened from a crouch.
Blood ran down the side of his face. &ldquo;Hurry. We must be away from
here before it gets out of hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Staring past him wide-eyed, Nynaeve wondered what he
considered out of hand. Bayle Domon&rsquo;s sailors, at least three
hundred of them, formed a semicircle two deep about the door, Domon
himself waving a cudgel, shouting to encourage them. He had to
shout for the roar that filled the wide street. Men jostled and
struggled and shouted in a seething mass, barely held back by the
sailors&rsquo; clubs and staffs. Not that they were really interested in
the sailors. Scattered through the crowd, clumps of mounted
Whitecloaks swung their swords at men crowding them with pitchforks
and barrel staves and bare hands. Showers of stones fell around
them, sometimes banging off a helmet, but silently in the uproar. A
lone Whitecloak&rsquo;s horse suddenly screamed and reared, and toppled
over backward; it scrambled to its feet quickly, minus its rider.
Other riderless animals dotted the mass of men. Was this what they
had set off just to cover themselves? She tried reminding herself
why&mdash;put her hand on her pouch to feel the
<em>cuendillar</em> seal, the collar and bracelets&mdash;but it
was hard. Men were dying out there, surely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you women move?&rdquo; Thom called, waving for them
to come out. He had a bleeding gash over one bushy eyebrow, perhaps
from a stone, and his brown cloak would not even do for the ragbag
now. &ldquo;If the Panarch&rsquo;s Legion ever stops running, this could grow
messy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amathera made a startled sound, just before Elayne
pushed her firmly out. Nynaeve and Egeanin followed, and as soon as
all four women were out, the sailors folded in around them in a
tight ring that began straggling away from the palace. It was all
Nynaeve could do to keep her feet, jostled by the men who were
trying to protect her. Once Egeanin slipped and nearly fell.
Nynaeve caught her arm, helped her back up, and got a grateful
grin. <em>We are not so different</em>, she thought. <em>Not the
same, but not all that different</em>. She did not have to make
herself smile encouragingly at the Seanchan woman.</p>

<p>The milling mass lasted several streets away from the
palace, but once they broke clear the narrow twisting ways were
almost empty. Those who were not actually involved in the riot
seemed wise enough to stay clear of it. The sailors spread out a
little, giving the women more room. Any straggler who looked in
their direction got hard stares, though. The streets of Tanchico
were still the streets of Tanchico. Somehow that surprised Nynaeve.
It seemed that she had been weeks inside the palace. Surely the
city should be different.</p>

<p>When the babble began to fade behind them, Thom
managed a quite elegant bow to Amathera as he limped along. &ldquo;An
honor, Panarch,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If I may be of any service, you have
only to speak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shockingly, Amathera glanced at Elayne, grimaced
slightly, and said, &ldquo;You mistake me, good sir. I am only a poor
refugee from the countryside, rescued by these good women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom exchanged startled looks with Juilin and Domon,
but when he opened his mouth, Elayne said, &ldquo;Could we get on to the
inn, Thom? This is hardly the place for conversation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they reached the Three Plum Court, it was
scarcely less surprising to hear Elayne introduce the Panarch to
Rendra as Thera, a refugee with no money who needed a pallet, and
maybe some work to earn her meals. The innkeeper shrugged
resignedly, but as she led &ldquo;Thera&rdquo; away to the kitchens she was
already telling the woman what lovely hair she had and how pretty
she would look in the right dress.</p>

<p>Nynaeve waited until the rest of them were in the
Chamber of Falling Blossoms with the door closed before saying,
&ldquo;<em>Thera</em>? And she went along! Elayne, Rendra will have the
woman serving at table in the common room!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne did not seem surprised. &ldquo;Yes, very likely.&rdquo;
Sinking into a chair with a sigh, she kicked off her slippers and
began massaging her feet vigorously. &ldquo;It was not difficult to
convince Amathera she should stay in hiding for a few days. It
really isn&rsquo;t that far from &lsquo;The Panarch is dead&rsquo; to &lsquo;Death to the
Panarch.&rsquo; I think seeing the riot helped, too. She doesn&rsquo;t want to
depend on Andric to put her back on her throne; she wants her own
soldiers to do it, even if it means hiding until she can get in
touch with the Lord Captain of the Legion. I believe Andric is in
for a surprise with her. It is too bad <em>he</em> doesn&rsquo;t surprise
<em>her</em>. She deserves it.&rdquo; Domon and Juilin exchanged glances,
shook their heads uncomprehendingly. Egeanin nodded to herself as
if she, at least, understood, and approved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; Nynaeve demanded. &ldquo;You may have been upset
because she sneaked off on her own, but this? How did she manage
that anyway, with two of you watching her?&rdquo; Egeanin&rsquo;s eyes
flickered toward Elayne, so quickly Nynaeve was not sure she had
really seen it.</p>

<p>Elayne bent to rub the sole of one foot. It must have
hurt; there was red in her cheeks. &ldquo;Nynaeve, the woman has no idea
what the lives of the common people are like.&rdquo; As if she did! &ldquo;She
does seem to have a true concern for justice&mdash;I think she
does&mdash;yet it did not bother her at all that there was enough
food in the palace for a year. I mentioned the soup kitchens, and
she did not know what I was talking about! A few days working for
her supper will do her good.&rdquo; Stretching her legs under the table,
she worked her bare toes. &ldquo;Oh, that does feel good. Not that she&rsquo;ll
have many, I suppose. Not if she is to rally the Panarch&rsquo;s Legion
to pry Liandrin and the others out of the palace. A pity, but there
it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she has to,&rdquo; Nynaeve told her firmly. It was
good to sit down, though she could not understand the girl&rsquo;s
concern with her feet. They had hardly walked at all today. &ldquo;And
the sooner the better. We need the Panarch, and not in Rendra&rsquo;s
kitchen.&rdquo; She did not think there was any need to worry about
Moghedien. That woman had had every opportunity to come into the
open, after she had freed herself. That still puzzled her; she must
have been careless in tying off the shield. But if Moghedien had
been unwilling to face her then, when she must have known Nynaeve
was nearly exhausted, she could not think the woman would come
after them. Not for something she seemed to think was not worth
very much. The same did not apply to Liandrin, however. If Liandrin
figured out half of what had happened, she <em>would</em> be
hunting them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The justice of the Daughter-Heir,&rdquo; Thom murmured,
&ldquo;may yet supersede the justice of the Panarch. There were men
streaming in through that door as we left, and I think some had
already got in the front. I saw smoke coming out of several
windows. By tonight, little more than a fire-gutted ruin will
remain. No need for soldiers to chase the Black Ajah, and thus
&lsquo;Thera&rsquo; can have her few days to learn the lesson you want to teach.
You will make a fine queen one day, Elayne of Andor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s pleased smile faded as she looked at him.
Rising to pad around the table, she rummaged in his coat pockets
for a kerchief and began dabbing blood from his forehead despite
his protests. &ldquo;Hold still,&rdquo; she told him, sounding for all the
world like a mother tending an unruly child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could we at least see what we risked our necks for?&rdquo;
he said when it became clear Elayne was going to do exactly as she
wished.</p>

<p>Opening her belt pouch, Nynaeve laid the contents out
on the table, the black-and-white disc that helped hold the Dark
One&rsquo;s prison shut, the collar and bracelets that sent ripples of
sorrow through her before she could lay them down. Everyone
gathered close to stare.</p>

<p>Domon fingered the seal. &ldquo;I did own a thing like this
once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve doubted it. Only seven had been made. Three
were broken now, <em>cuendillar</em> or no. Another was in
Moiraine&rsquo;s hands. Four surviving. How well could four keep that
prison at Shayol Ghul locked? A shivery thought.</p>

<p>Egeanin touched the collar, pushed the bracelets away
from the collar. If she felt the emotions trapped in them, she did
not show it. Perhaps that sensitivity came only with the ability to
channel. &ldquo;It is not an <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>,&rdquo; the Seanchan woman said.
&ldquo;That is made of a silvery metal, and all of one piece.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve wished she had not mentioned
<em>a&rsquo;dam. But she never wore the bracelet of one. And she
did let that poor woman she told us about go. Poor woman</em>. She&mdash;<em>this Bethamin&mdash;was the one who controlled women
with an</em> a&rsquo;dam. Egeanin had showed more mercy than Nynaeve
would have. &ldquo;It is as least as much like an <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> as you
and I are alike, Egeanin.&rdquo; The woman looked startled, but after a
moment she nodded. Not so different. Two women, each doing the best
she could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to keep on pursuing Liandrin?&rdquo; Juilin
seated himself, arms folded on the table, studying the things
there. &ldquo;Whether or not she is chased out of Tanchico, she is still
out there. And the others. But these seem too important to leave
lying about. I am only a thief-catcher, but I would say these must
be taken to the White Tower for safekeeping.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Nynaeve was startled at her own vehemence. So
were the others, by the way they stared at her. Slowly she picked
up the seal and replaced it in her pouch. &ldquo;This goes to the Tower.
But that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She did not want to touch the black things again.
If those were in the Tower, Aes Sedai might decide to use them just
as the Black Ajah had intended to. To control Rand. Would Moiraine?
Siuan Sanche? She would not take the chance. &ldquo;That is too dangerous
to risk it ever falling back into the hands of Darkfriends. Elayne,
can you destroy them? Melt them. I don&rsquo;t care if they burn through
the table. Just destroy them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see what you mean,&rdquo; Elayne said with a grimace.
Nynaeve doubted she did&mdash;Elayne believed in the Tower
wholeheartedly&mdash;but she believed in Rand, too.</p>

<p>Nynaeve could not see the glow of <em>saidar</em>, of
course, but the intent way the girl stared at the vile objects told
her she was channeling. The bracelets and necklace lay there.
Elayne frowned; her stare became more intent. Abruptly she shook
her head. Her hand poised hesitantly for a moment, close to one of
the bracelets, before picking it up. And dropped it again, with a
gasp. &ldquo;It feels&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s full of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Drawing a deep breath,
she said, &ldquo;I did what you asked, Nynaeve. A hammer would be burning
a puddle for the Fire I wove into it, but it isn&rsquo;t even warm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Moghedien had not lied. Doubtless she had thought
there was no need, that she would surely win. <em>How</em> did
<em>the woman get loose?</em> But what to do with the things? She
was not going to let them fall into <em>anyone&rsquo;s</em> hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Domon, do you know a very deep part of the
sea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do, Mistress al&rsquo;Meara,&rdquo; he said slowly.</p>

<p>Gingerly, trying not to feel the emotions, Nynaeve
shoved the collar and bracelets across the table to him. &ldquo;Then drop
these into it, where no one can ever fish them out again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a moment, he nodded. &ldquo;I will.&rdquo; He stuffed them
into his coat pocket hurriedly, clearly disliking to touch
something that must have to do with the Power. &ldquo;In the deepest part
of the sea I do know, near the Aile Somera.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egeanin was frowning at the floor, no doubt thinking
about the Illianer leaving. Nynaeve had not forgotten the woman
calling him &ldquo;a properly set-up man.&rdquo; She herself felt like
laughing. It was all but done. As soon as Domon could sail, the
hateful collar and bracelets would be gone forever. They could
leave for Tar Valon. And then&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Then back to Tear, or wherever
al&rsquo;Lan Mandragoran was. Facing Moghedien, realizing how close she
had been to being killed or worse, only made her urgency to deal
with him greater. A man she had to share with a woman she hated,
but if Egeanin could look fondly on a man she once took prisoner&mdash;and Domon was certainly eyeing her with interest&mdash;and
if Elayne could love a man who would go mad, then she could puzzle
out some way to enjoy what she could have of Lan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we go downstairs and see how &lsquo;Thera&rsquo; is taking
to being a servant?&rdquo; she suggested. Soon for Tar Valon. Soon.</p>
