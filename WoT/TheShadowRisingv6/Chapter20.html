<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">E</span>layne
struggled to open the latch on an arm of her
chair and darted after them, almost colliding with Nynaeve at the
ladder. The ship still rocked, if not as violently as before.
Uncertain whether they were sinking, she pushed Nynaeve ahead of
her, prodding her to climb faster.</p>

<p>On the deck the crew dashed about, checking the
rigging or peering over the side to inspect the hull, shouting
about earthquakes. The same shouts were rising from the dockmen,
too, but Elayne knew better, despite the tumbled things on the
piers and the ships yet pitching at their moorings.</p>

<p>She stared toward the Stone. The huge fortress was
still, except for masses of startled birds swirling about and that
pale banner waving, almost lazily, in an isolated breeze. No sign
that anything had ever touched the mountainous mass. That had been
Rand, though. She was sure of it.</p>

<p>She turned to find Nynaeve looking at her, and for a
long moment their eyes met. &ldquo;A fine pickling, if he&rsquo;s damaged the
ship,&rdquo; Elayne said finally. &ldquo;How are we supposed to get to Tanchico
if he goes tossing all the ships about?&rdquo; <em>Light, he has to be
all right. I can do nothing if he isn&rsquo;t. He is all right. He
is</em>.</p>

<p>Nynaeve touched her arm reassuringly. &ldquo;No doubt that
second letter of yours touched a nerve. Men always overreact when
they let their emotions go; it&rsquo;s the price for holding them in the
way they do. He may be the Dragon Reborn, but he must learn, man to
woman, that&mdash;What are <em>they</em> doing here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rdquo; were two men standing amid the bustling Sea
Folk on the deck. One was Thom Merrilin, in his gleeman&rsquo;s cloak,
with leather-cased harp and flute on his back and a bundle lying at
his feet beside a battered wooden box with a lock. The other was a
lean handsome Tairen in his middle years, a hard dark man wearing a
flat conical straw hat and one of those commoner&rsquo;s coats that fit
snugly to the waist, then flared like a short skirt. A notched
sword-breaker hung at a belt worn over his coat, and he leaned on a
pale staff of nobbly, jointed wood exactly his own height and no
thicker than his thumb. A square tied parcel dangled by a loop from
his shoulder. Elayne knew him: his name was Juilin Sandar.</p>

<p>It was obvious the two men were strangers despite
standing almost side by side; they held themselves with stiff
reticence. Their attentions were directed the same way, though,
split between following the Sailmistress&rsquo;s progress toward the
stern deck and peering at Elayne and Nynaeve, plainly uncertain and
masking it behind a brisk show of confidence. Thom grinned and
stroked his long white mustaches and nodded every time he looked up
at the two of them; Sandar made solemn, self-assured bows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is not damaged,&rdquo; Coine said, climbing the ladder.
&ldquo;I can sail within the hour, if it pleases you. Well within, if a
Tairen pilot can be found. I will sail without him, if not, though
it means never returning to Tear.&rdquo; She followed their gaze to the
two men. &ldquo;They ask passage, the gleeman to Tanchico, and the thief
catcher to wherever you travel. I cannot refuse them, and yet&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Her dark eyes came back to Elayne and Nynaeve. &ldquo;I will do so, if
you ask it.&rdquo; Reluctance to break custom battled in her voice with&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Desire to help them? To serve the Coramoor? &ldquo;The thief
catcher is a good man, even considering that he is shorebound. No
offense to you, under the Light. The gleeman I do not know, yet a
gleeman can enliven a voyage and lighten tired hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know Master Sandar?&rdquo; Nynaeve said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twice he has found those who pilfered from us, and
found them quickly. Another shoreman would have taken longer so he
might ask more for the work. It is obvious that you know him, as
well. Do you wish me to refuse passage?&rdquo; Her reluctance was still
there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us see why they are here first,&rdquo; Nynaeve said in
a flat voice that did not bode well for either man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I should do the talking,&rdquo; Elayne suggested,
gently but firmly. &ldquo;That way, you can watch to see if they are
hiding anything.&rdquo; She did not say that that way Nynaeve&rsquo;s temper
would not get the better of her, but the wry smile the other woman
gave her said she had heard it anyway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, Elayne. I will watch them. Perhaps you
might study how I keep calm. You know how you are when you become
overwrought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne had to laugh.</p>

<p>The two men straightened as she and Nynaeve
approached. Around them the crew bustled, swarming into the
rigging, hauling ropes, lashing some things down and unlashing
others, to orders relayed from the Sailmistress. They moved around
the four shorepeople with barely a glance.</p>

<p>Elayne frowned at Thom Merrilin thoughtfully. She was
sure she had never seen the gleeman before his appearance in the
Stone, yet even then she had been struck by something familiar
about him. Not that that was likely. Gleemen were village
performers, in the main; her mother had certainly never had one at
the palace in Caemlyn. The only gleemen Elayne could remember
seeing had been in the villages near her mother&rsquo;s country estates,
and this white-haired hawk of a man had surely never been
there.</p>

<p>She decided to speak to the thief-catcher first. He
insisted on that, she remembered; what was a thief-taker elsewhere
was a thief-catcher in Tear, and the distinction seemed important
to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Sandar,&rdquo; she said gravely. &ldquo;You may not
remember us. I am Elayne Trakand, and this is my friend, Nynaeve
al&rsquo;Meara. I understand that you wish to travel to the same
destination as we. Might I ask why? The last time we saw you, you
had not served us very well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man did not blink at the suggestion he might not
remember them. His eyes flickered across their hands, noting the
absence of rings. Those dark eyes noted everything, and recorded it
indelibly. &ldquo;I do remember, Mistress Trakand, and well. But, if you
will forgive me, the <em>last</em> time I served you was in the
company of Mat Cauthon, when we pulled you both out of the water
before the silverpike could get you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve harrumphed, but not loudly. It had been a
cell, not the water, and the Black Ajah, not silverpike. Nynaeve in
particular did not like being reminded that they had needed help
that time. Of course, they would not have been in that cell without
Juilin Sandar. No, that was not entirely fair. True, but not
completely fair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all very well,&rdquo; Elayne said briskly, &ldquo;but
you still haven&rsquo;t said why you want to go to Tanchico.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew a deep breath and eyed Nynaeve warily. Elayne
was not sure that she liked him being more careful of the other
woman than of her. &ldquo;I was rousted out of my house no more than half
an hour gone,&rdquo; he said carefully, &ldquo;by a man you know, I think. A
tall, stone faced man calling himself Lan.&rdquo; Nynaeve&rsquo;s eyebrows rose
slightly. &ldquo;He came on behalf of another man you know. A&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;shepherd, I was told. I was given a great quantity of gold and told
to accompany you. Both of you. I was told that if you do not return
safely from this journey&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Shall we just say it would be better
to drown myself than come back? Lan was emphatic, and the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;shepherd no less so in his message. The Sailmistress tells me I
cannot have passage unless you agree. I am not without certain
skills that can be useful.&rdquo; The staff whirled in his hands, a
whistling blur, and was still. His fingers touched the
sword-breaker on his hip, like a short sword but unsharpened, its
slots meant to catch a blade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men will find ways to get &rsquo;round what you tell them
to do,&rdquo; Nynaeve murmured, sounding not unpleased.</p>

<p>Elayne only frowned vexedly. Rand had sent him? He
must not have read the second letter before he did. <em>Burn him!
Why does he leap about so? No time to send another letter, and it
would probably only confuse him more if I did. And make me look a
bigger fool. Burn him!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, Master Merrilin?&rdquo; Nynaeve said. &ldquo;Did the
shepherd send a gleeman after us, too? Or the other man? To keep us
amused with your juggling and fire eating, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom had been scrutinizing Sandar closely, but he
shifted his attentions smoothly and made an elegant bow, only
spoiling it with a too-elaborate flourish of that patch-covered
cloak. &ldquo;Not the shepherd, Mistress al&rsquo;Meara. A lady of our mutual
acquaintance asked&mdash;<em>asked</em>&mdash;me to accompany
you. The lady who found you and the shepherd in Emond&rsquo;s Field.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Nynaeve said suspiciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, too, have useful skills,&rdquo; Thom told her with a
glance at the thief-catcher. &ldquo;Other than juggling, that is. And I
have been to Tanchico several times. I know the city well. I can
tell you where to find a good inn, and what districts are dangerous
in daylight as well as after dark, and who must be bribed so the
Civil Watch does not take too close an interest in your doings.
They are keen on watching outlanders. I can help you with a good
many things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That familiarity tickled at Elayne&rsquo;s mind again.
Before she realized what she was doing, she reached up and tugged
at one of his long white mustaches. He gave a start, and she
clapped both hands to her mouth, flushing crimson. &ldquo;Forgive me. I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I seemed to remember doing that before. I mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I
<em>am</em> sorry.&rdquo; <em>Light, why did I do that? He must think me
an imbecile</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;would remember,&rdquo; he said, very stiffly.</p>

<p>She hoped he was not affronted. It was hard to tell
from his expression. Men could be offended when they should be
amused, and amused when they should be offended. If they were going
to be traveling together&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;That was the first time she realized
that she had decided they could come. &ldquo;Nynaeve?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>The other woman understood the unspoken question, of
course. She studied the two men thoroughly, then nodded. &ldquo;They may
come. As long as they agree to do as they are told. I&rsquo;ll not have
some wool-brained man going his own way and endangering us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you command, Mistress al&rsquo;Meara,&rdquo; Sandar said
immediately, with a bow, but Thom said, &ldquo;A gleeman is a free soul,
Nynaeve, but I can promise I will not endanger you. Far from
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you are told,&rdquo; Nynaeve said pointedly. &ldquo;Your word
on it, or you will watch this ship sail from the dock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Atha&rsquo;an Miere do not refuse passage to anyone,
Nynaeve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think not? Was the thief-taker&rdquo;&mdash;Sandar
winced&mdash;&ldquo;the only one told he needed our permission? As you
are told, <em>Master</em> Merrilin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom tossed his white head like a fractious horse and
breathed heavily, but finally he nodded. &ldquo;My word on it,
<em>Mistress</em> al&rsquo;Meara.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well then,&rdquo; Nynaeve said in a bracing voice.
&ldquo;It is settled. You two find the Sailmistress now, and tell her I
said to find the pair of you a cubbyhole somewhere if she can, out
of our way. Off with you, now. Quickly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sandar bowed again and left; Thom quivered visibly
before joining him, stiff-backed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you not being too hard on them?&rdquo; Elayne said as
soon as they were out of earshot. That was not far, with all the
hurly-burly on deck. &ldquo;We do have to travel together, after all.
&lsquo;Smooth words make smooth companions.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Best to begin as we mean to go on. Elayne, Thom
Merrilin knows very well we are not full Aes Sedai.&rdquo; She lowered
her voice and glanced around as she said it. None of the crew was
even looking at them, except for the Sailmistress, back near the
sterndeck where she was listening to the tall gleeman and the
thief-catcher. &ldquo;Men talk&mdash;they always do&mdash;so Sandar
will know it soon enough, as well. They&rsquo;d present no trouble to Aes
Sedai, but two Accepted&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Given half a chance, they would both
be doing things they thought for the best no matter what we said. I
do not mean to give them even that half chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you are right. Do you think they know why we
are going to Tanchico?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve sniffed. &ldquo;No, or they&rsquo;d not be so sanguine, I
think. And I would rather not tell them until we must.&rdquo; She gave
Elayne a meaningful look; there was no need for her to say she
would not have told the Sailmistress, either, had it been left to
her. &ldquo;Here is a saying for you. &lsquo;Borrow trouble, and you repay
tenfold.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You speak as if you don&rsquo;t trust them, Nynaeve.&rdquo; She
would have said the other woman was behaving like Moiraine, but
Nynaeve would not appreciate the comparison.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can we? Juilin Sandar betrayed us once before. Yes,
yes, I know no man could have avoided it, but there it is just the
same. And Liandrin and the others know his face. We will have to
put him in different clothes. Perhaps make him let his hair grow
longer. Perhaps a mustache, like that thing infesting the gleeman&rsquo;s
face. It might do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Thom Merrilin?&rdquo; Elayne asked. &ldquo;I think we can
trust him. I don&rsquo;t know why, but I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He admitted being sent by Moiraine,&rdquo; Nynaeve said
wearily. &ldquo;What has he not admitted, though? What did she tell him
that he hasn&rsquo;t told us? Is he meant to help us, or something else?
Moiraine plays her own game so often, I trust her this much more
than I do Liandrin.&rdquo; She held her thumb and forefinger half an inch
apart. &ldquo;She will use us&mdash;you and me both&mdash;use us up, if
it helps Rand. Or rather, if it helps whatever she has planned for
Rand. She would leash him for a lapdog if she could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moiraine knows what has to be done, Nynaeve.&rdquo; For
once she was reluctant to admit that. What Moiraine knew had to be
done might well speed Rand on his way toward Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don that
much faster. On his way toward death, perhaps. Rand balanced
against the world. It was silly&mdash;foolish and childish&mdash;that those
scales should tremble so evenly for her. Yet she did not dare make
them swing, even in her mind, because she was not sure which way
she would send them. &ldquo;She knows it better than he does,&rdquo; she said,
making her voice firm. &ldquo;Better than we.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo; Nynaeve sighed. &ldquo;But I do not have to like
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ropes were cast off at the bow, where triangular
sails suddenly broke out, and <em>Wavedancer</em> heeled away from
the dock. More sails appeared, great white squares and triangles,
the sternlines were cast off, and the ship curled out into the
river in a great arc through the anchored ships awaiting their turn
at the docks, a smooth curve that ended heading south, downriver.
The Sea Folk handled their ship as a master horseman would a fine
steed. That peculiar spoked wheel worked the rudder, somehow, as
one of the bare-chested crewmen turned it. A man, Elayne was
relieved to see. Sailmistress and Windfinder stood to one side of
the wheel, Coine issuing occasional orders, sometimes after a
murmured consultation with her sister. Toram watched for a time,
with a face that might have been carved from a deck plank, then
stalked below.</p>

<p>There was a Tairen on the sterndeck, a plump,
dejected looking man in a dull yellow coat with puffy gray sleeves,
rubbing his hands nervously. He had been hustled aboard just as the
gangway was being hauled up, a pilot who was supposed to guide
<em>Wavedancer</em> downriver; according to Tairen law, no ship
could pass through the Fingers of the Dragon without a Tairen pilot
aboard. His dejection certainly came from doing nothing, for if he
gave any directions, the Sea Folk paid them no heed.</p>

<p>Muttering about seeing what their cabin was like,
Nynaeve went downstairs&mdash;below&mdash;but Elayne was enjoying
the breeze across the deck and the feel of starting out. To travel,
to see places she had not seen before, was a joy in itself. She had
never expected to, not like this. The Daughter Heir of Andor might
make a few state visits, and she would make more once she succeeded
to the throne, but they would be bounded about with ceremony and
propriety. Not like this at all. Barefoot Sea Folk and a ship
headed to sea.</p>

<p>The riverbank slid by quite quickly as the sun
climbed, an occasional cluster of huddled stone farmhouses and
barns, bleak and lonely, appearing and vanishing behind. No
villages, though. Tear would not allow the smallest village on the
river between the city and the sea, for even the tiniest might one
day become competition for the capital. The High Lords controlled
the size of villages and towns throughout the country with a
buildings tax that grew heavier the more buildings there were.
Elayne was sure they would never have allowed Godan to thrive, on
the Bay of Remara, if not for the supposed necessity of a strong
presence overlooking Mayene. In a way it was a relief to be leaving
such foolish people behind. If only she did not have to leave one
foolish man behind as well.</p>

<p>The number of fishing boats, most small and all
surrounded by clouds of hopeful gulls and fisher birds, increased
the farther south <em>Wavedancer</em> went, especially once the
vessel entered the maze of waterways called the Fingers of the
Dragon. Often the birds overhead and the long poles that held the
nets were all that was visible besides plains of reeds and
knifegrass rippling in the breezes, dotted with low islands where
odd, twisted trees grew with spidery tangles of roots exposed to
the air. Many boats worked right in the reeds, though not with
nets. Once Elayne saw some of them close to clear water, men and
women dropping hooked lines into the watery growth and pulling up
wriggling, dark-striped fish as long as a man&rsquo;s arm.</p>

<p>The Tairen pilot began to pace anxiously once they
were in the delta, with the sun overhead, turning up his nose at an
offered bowl of thick spicy fish stew and bread. Elayne ate hers
hungrily, wiping her pottery bowl with the last scrap of bread,
though she shared his unease. Passages broad and narrow ran in
every direction. Some ended abruptly, in plain sight, against a
wall of reeds. There was no way to tell which of the others might
not vanish just as suddenly around the next bend. Coine did not
slow <em>Wavedancer</em>, regardless, or hesitate at choosing a
way. Obviously she knew the channels to take, or the Windfinder
did, but the pilot still muttered to himself as if he expected to
run aground any moment.</p>

<p>It was late afternoon when the river mouth suddenly
appeared ahead, and the endless stretch of the Sea of Storms
beyond. The Sea Folk did something with the sails, and the ship
shuddered softly to a dead halt. It was only then that Elayne
noticed a large rowboat skittering like a many legged waterbug out
from an island where a few forlorn stone buildings stood around the
base of a tall narrow tower where men stood small at the top
beneath the banner of Tear, three white crescents on a field of red
and gold. The pilot took the purse Coine proffered without a word
and scrambled down a rope ladder to the boat. As soon as he was
aboard, the sails were swung about again, and <em>Wavedancer</em>
breasted the first rollers of open sea, rising slightly, slicing
through. Sea Folk scampered through the rigging, setting more
sails, as the ship sped south and west, away from the land.</p>

<p>When the last thin strip of land dropped below the
horizon, the Sea Folk women doffed their blouses. All of them, even
the Sailmistress and the Windfinder. Elayne did not know where to
look. All those women walking about half dressed and completely
unconcerned by the men all around them. Juilin Sandar seemed to be
having as hard a time as she was, alternating between staring at
the women wide eyed and staring at his feet until he finally all
but ran below. Elayne would not let herself be routed that way. She
opted for staring over the side at the sea, instead.</p>

<p><em>Different customs</em>, she reminded herself.
<em>As long they don&rsquo;t expect me to do the same</em>. The very
thought nearly made her laugh hysterically. Somehow, the Black Ajah
was easier to contemplate than that. <em>Different customs.
Light!</em></p>

<p>The sky grew purple, with a dull golden sun on the
horizon. Scores of dolphins escorted the vessel, rolling and
arching alongside, and farther out some sort of sparkling silver
blue fish rose above the surface in schools, gliding on
outstretched fins a span across for fifty paces or more before
plunging back into the swelling gray green water. Elayne watched in
amazement for a dozen flights before they did not appear again.</p>

<p>But the dolphins, great sleek shapes, were wondrous
enough, a guard of honor taking <em>Wavedancer</em> back where he
belonged. Those she recognized from descriptions in books; it was
said if they found you drowning, they would push you to shore. She
was not sure she believed it, but it was a pretty story. She
followed them along the side of the ship, to the bow, where they
frolicked in the bow wave, rolling on their sides to look up at her
without losing an inch.</p>

<p>She was almost in the narrowest point of the bow
before she realized Thom Merrilin was there before her, smiling
down at the dolphins a bit sadly, his cloak catching the wind like
the cloud of sails above. He had rid himself of his belongings. He
did seem familiar; truly he did. &ldquo;Are you not happy, Master
Merrilin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He glanced at her sideways. &ldquo;Please, call me Thom, my
Lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thom, then. But not my Lady. I am only Mistress
Trakand here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you say, Mistress Trakand,&rdquo; he said with a hint
of a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you look at these dolphins and be unhappy,
Thom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are free,&rdquo; he murmured, in such a tone that she
was not sure he was answering her. &ldquo;They have no decisions to make,
no prices to pay. Not a worry in the world, except finding fish to
eat. And sharks, I suppose. And lionfish. And likely a hundred more
things I don&rsquo;t know. Perhaps it is not such an enviable life at
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you envy them?&rdquo; He did not answer, but that was
the wrong question anyway. She needed to make him smile again. No,
laugh. For some reason she was sure if she could make him laugh,
she would remember where she had seen him before. She chose another
topic, one that should be nearer his heart. &ldquo;Do you mean to compose
the epic of Rand, Thom?&rdquo; Epics were for bards, not gleemen, but
there could be no harm in a little flattery. &ldquo;The epic of the
Dragon Reborn. Loial means to write a book, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I will, Mistress Trakand. Perhaps. But
neither my composing nor the Ogier&rsquo;s book will make much difference
in the long run. Our stories will not survive, in the long run.
When the next Age comes&mdash;&rdquo; He grimaced, and tugged one of his
mustaches. &ldquo;Come to think of it, that may be no more than a year or
two off. How is the end of an Age marked? It cannot always be a
cataclysm on the order of the Breaking. But then, if the Prophecies
are to be believed, this one will be. That is the trouble with
prophecy. The original is always in the Old Tongue, and maybe High
Chant as well: if you don&rsquo;t know what a thing means beforehand,
there&rsquo;s no way to puzzle it out. Does it mean what it says, or is
it a flowery way of saying something entirely different?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were talking of your epic,&rdquo; she said, trying to
guide him back, but he shook his shaggy white head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was talking of change. My epic, if I compose it&mdash;and Loial&rsquo;s book&mdash;will be no more than seed, if we are
both lucky. Those who know the truth will die, and their
grandchildren&rsquo;s grandchildren will remember something different.
And <em>their</em> grandchildren&rsquo;s grandchildren something else
again. Two dozen generations, and you may be the hero of it, not
Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; she laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or maybe Mat, or Lan. Or even myself.&rdquo; He grinned at
her, warming his weathered face. &ldquo;Thom Merrilin. Not a gleeman&mdash;but what? Who can say? Not eating fire, but breathing it.
Hurling it about like an Aes Sedai.&rdquo; He flourished his cloak. &ldquo;Thom
Merrilin, the mysterious hero, toppling mountains and raising up
kings.&rdquo; The grin became a rich belly laugh. &ldquo;Rand al&rsquo;Thor may be
lucky if the next Age remembers his name correctly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was right; it was not just a feeling. That face,
that mirth-filled laugh; she did remember them. But from where? She
had to keep him talking. &ldquo;Does it always happen that way? I do not
think anyone doubts, say, that Artur Hawkwing conquered an empire.
The whole world, or near enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hawkwing, young Mistress? He made an empire, all
right, but do you think he did everything the books and stories and
epics say he did? The way they say he did it? Killed the hundred
best men of an opposing army, one by one? The two armies just stood
there while one of the generals&mdash;a king&mdash;fought a
hundred duels?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The books say he did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t time between sunrise and sunset for one
man to fight a hundred duels, girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She almost stopped him short&mdash;<em>girl?</em>
She was Daughter Heir of Andor, not <em>girl</em>&mdash;but he had
the bit in his teeth. &ldquo;And that is only a thousand years back. Go
back further, back to the oldest tales I know, from the Age before
the Age of Legends. Did Mosk and Merk really fight with spears of
fire, and were they even giants? Was Elsbet really queen of the
whole world, and was Anla really her sister? Was Anla truly the
Wise Counselor, or was it someone else? As well ask what sort of
animal ivory comes from, or what kind of plant grows silk. Unless
that comes from an animal, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know about those other questions,&rdquo; Elayne
said a bit stiffly; being called girl still rankled, &ldquo;but you could
ask the Sea Folk about ivory and silk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed again&mdash;as she had hoped, though it
still did no more than drive home the certainty that she knew him&mdash;but instead of calling her foolish, as she half expected and
was prepared for, he said, &ldquo;Practical and to the point, just like
your mother. Both feet on the earth and few flights of fancy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She lifted her chin a little, made her face cooler.
She might be passing herself off as simple Mistress Trakand, but
this was something else. He was an amiable old man, and she did
want to reason out the puzzle of him, but he was a gleeman after
all, and he should not speak of a queen in such familiar tones.
Oddly, infuriatingly, he appeared amused. Amused!</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Atha&rsquo;an Miere do not know, either,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;They see no more of the lands beyond the Aiel Waste than a few
miles around the handful of harbors where they are permitted to
land. Those places are walled high, and the walls guarded so they
cannot even climb up to see what is on the other side. If one of
their ships makes landfall anywhere else&mdash;or any ship not
theirs; only the Sea Folk are allowed to come there&mdash;that
ship and its crew are never seen again. And that is almost as much
as I can tell you after more years of asking than I like to think
of. The Atha&rsquo;an Miere keep their secrets, but I do not believe they
know much to keep here. From what I have been able to learn, the
Cairhienin were treated the same, when they still had the right to
travel the Silk Path across the Waste. Cairhienin traders never saw
anything but one walled town, and those who wandered from it
vanished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne found herself studying him much as she had the
dolphins. What kind of man was this? Twice now he might have
laughed at her&mdash;he <em>had</em> been amused just then, as
much as she hated to admit it&mdash;but instead he talked to her
as seriously as&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Well, as father to daughter. &ldquo;You might find
a few answers on this ship, Thom. They were bound east until we
convinced the Sailmistress to take us to Tanchico. To Shara, the
Cargomaster said, east of Mayene; that must mean beyond the
Waste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stared at her for a moment. &ldquo;Shara, you say? I
have never heard any such name before. Is Shara city or nation or
both? Perhaps I will learn a little more.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>What did I say?</em> she wondered. <em>I said
something to make him think. Light! I told him we convinced Coine
to change her plans</em>. It could not make any difference, but she
scolded herself severely. A careless word to this nice old man
might do no harm, but the same might kill her in Tanchico, and
Nynaeve, too, not to mention the thief-catcher and Thom himself. If
he was such a nice old man. &ldquo;Thom, why did you come with us? Just
because Moiraine asked?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His shoulders shook; she realized he was laughing at
himself. &ldquo;As to that, who can say? Aes Sedai asking favors are not
easily resisted. Perhaps it was the prospect of your pleasant
company for the voyage. Or perhaps I decided Rand is old enough to
look after himself for a while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed out loud, and she had to laugh with him.
The idea of this white-haired old fellow looking after Rand. The
feeling that she could trust him came back, stronger than ever, as
he looked at her. Not because he could laugh at himself, or not
only that. She could not have given a reason beyond the fact that,
looking up into those blue eyes, she could not make herself believe
this man would ever do anything to harm her.</p>

<p>The urge to pull one of his mustaches again was
almost overwhelming, but she schooled her hands to stillness. She
was not a child, after all. A child. She opened her mouth&mdash;and suddenly everything went out of her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please excuse me, Thom,&rdquo; she said hurriedly. &ldquo;I must&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Excuse me.&rdquo; She started toward the stern quickly, not waiting
for a reply. He probably thought the ship&rsquo;s motion had upset her
stomach. <em>Wavedancer</em> was pitching more rapidly, moving
faster through the great sea swells as the wind freshened.</p>

<p>Two men stood at the wheel on the sterndeck, the
muscle of both needed to hold the vessel on course, The
Sailmistress was not on deck, but the Windfinder was, standing at
the rail beyond the wheelmen, bare to the waist like the men,
studying the sky where billowing clouds rolled more fiercely than
the ocean. For once it was not Jorin&rsquo;s state of dress&mdash;or
undress&mdash;that bothered Elayne. The glow of a woman embracing
<em>saidar</em> surrounded her, clearly visible despite the lurid
light. That was what she had felt, what had drawn her. A woman
channeling.</p>

<p>Elayne stopped short of the sterndeck to study what
she was doing. The flows of Air and Water the Windfinder handled
were cable-thick, yet her weaving was intricate, almost delicate,
and it reached as far as the eye could see across the waters, a
web drawn across the sky. The wind rose higher, higher; the
wheelmen strained, and <em>Wavedancer</em> flew through the sea.
The weaving stopped, the glow of <em>saidar</em> vanished, and
Jorin slumped at the rail, leaning on her hands.</p>

<p>Elayne climbed the ladder quietly, yet the Sea Folk
woman spoke in a soft voice without turning her head as soon as she
was near enough to hear. &ldquo;In the middle as I worked, I thought that
you were watching me. I could not stop then; there might have been
a storm even <em>Wavedancer</em> could not survive. The Sea of
Storms is well named; it will throw up bad winds enough without my
help. I meant not to do this at all, but Coine said we must go
quickly. For you, and for the Coramoor.&rdquo; She raised her eyes to
peer at the sky. &ldquo;This wind will hold until morning, if it pleases
the Light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is why the Sea Folk do not carry Aes Sedai?&rdquo;
Elayne said, taking a place beside her at the rail. &ldquo;So the Tower
won&rsquo;t learn Windfinders can channel. That is why it was your
decision to let us aboard, not your sister&rsquo;s. Jorin, the Tower will
not try to stop you. There is no law in the Tower to stop any woman
channeling, even if she is not Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your White Tower will interfere. It will try to
reach onto our ships, where we are free of the land and landsmen.
It will try to tie us to itself, binding us away from the sea.&rdquo; She
sighed heavily. &ldquo;The wave that has passed cannot be called
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne wished she could tell her it was not so, but
the Tower did seek out women and girls who could learn to channel,
both to bolster the numbers of Aes Sedai, dwindling now compared to
what they once had been, and because of the danger of learning
unguided. In truth, a woman who could be taught to touch the True
Source usually found herself in the Tower whatever she wanted, at
least until she was trained enough not to kill herself or others by
accident.</p>

<p>After a moment Jorin went on. &ldquo;It is not all of us.
Only some. We send a few girls to Tar Valon so Aes Sedai will not
come looking among us. No ship will carry Aes Sedai whose
Windfinder can weave the winds. When you first named yourselves, I
thought you must know me, but you did not speak, and you asked
passage, and I hoped perhaps you were not Aes Sedai despite your
rings. A foolish hope. I could feel the strength of you both. And
now the White Tower will know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot promise to keep your secret, but I will do
what I can.&rdquo; The woman deserved more. &ldquo;Jorin, I swear by the honor
of House Trakand of Andor that I will do my best to keep your
secret from any who would harm you or your people, and that if I
must reveal it to anyone, I will do all in my ability to protect
your people from interference. House Trakand is not without
influence, even in the Tower.&rdquo; <em>And I will make mother use it,
if need be. Somehow</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it pleases the Light,&rdquo; Jorin said fatalistically,
&ldquo;all will be well. All will be well, and all will be well, and all
manner of thing will be well, if it pleases the Light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a <em>damane</em> on that Seanchan ship,
wasn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo; The Windfinder gave her a quizzical look. &ldquo;One of
the captive women who can channel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see deeply for one so young. That is why I first
thought you might not be Aes Sedai, because you are so young; I
have daughters older than you, I think. I did not know she was a
captive; that makes me wish we could have saved her.
<em>Wavedancer</em> outran the Seanchan vessel easily at first&mdash;we
had heard of the Seanchan and their vessels with ribbed sails, that
they demanded strange oaths and punished those who would not give
them&mdash;but then the&mdash;<em>damane?</em>&mdash;broke two
of his masts, and they boarded him with swords. I managed to start
fires on the Seanchan vessel&mdash;weaving Fire is difficult for
me beyond lighting a lamp, but it pleased the Light to make it
enough&mdash;and Toram led the crew to fight the Seanchan back to
their own decks. We cut loose the boarding hooks, and their ship
drifted away, burning. They were too occupied with trying to save
him to bother us as we limped away. I regretted seeing him burn and
sink, then; he was a fine ship, I think, for heavy seas. Now I
regret it because we might have saved the woman, the
<em>damane</em>. Even if she damaged him, perhaps she would not
have, free. The Light illumine her soul, and the waters take her
peacefully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Telling the story had saddened her. She needed to be
distracted. &ldquo;Jorin, why do the Atha&rsquo;an Miere call ships &lsquo;he&rsquo;?
Everyone else I&rsquo;ve ever met calls them &lsquo;she.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t suppose it
makes any difference, but why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The men will give you a different answer,&rdquo; the
Windfinder said, smiling, &ldquo;speaking of strength and grandness and
the like as men will, but this is the truth. A ship is alive, and
he is like a man, with a true man&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo; She rubbed the rail
fondly, as if stroking something alive, something that could feel
her caress. &ldquo;Treat him well and care for him properly, and he will
fight for you against the worst sea. He will fight to keep you
alive even after the sea has long since given him his own
deathstroke. Neglect him, though, ignore the small warnings he
gives of danger, and he will drown you in a flat sea beneath a
cloudless sky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne hoped Rand was not as fickle as that. <em>Then
why does he hop about, glad to see me go one minute and sending
Juilin Sandar after me the next?</em> She told herself to stop
thinking about him. He was a long way away. There was nothing to be
done about him now.</p>

<p>She glanced over her shoulder toward the bow. Thom
was gone. She was sure she had found the key to his puzzle, just
before she had felt the Windfinder channeling. Something to do with
his smile. It was gone, whatever it was. Well, she meant to find it
again before they reached Tanchico, if she had to sit on him. But
he would still be there in the morning. &ldquo;Jorin, how long before we
reach Tanchico? I have been told rakers are the fastest ships in
the world, but how fast?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Tanchico? To serve the Coramoor, we will not stop
at any port between. Perhaps ten days, if I can weave the winds
well enough, if it pleases the Light that I find the proper
currents. Perhaps as few as seven or eight, with the grace of the
Light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten days?&rdquo; Elayne gasped. &ldquo;It cannot be possible.&rdquo;
She had seen maps, after all.</p>

<p>The other woman&rsquo;s smile was half pride, half
indulgence. &ldquo;As you yourself said, the fastest ships in the world.
The next quickest take half again as long over any stretch, and
most more than twice as long. Coasting craft that hug the shore and
anchor in the shallows each night&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She sniffed contemptuously
&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;require ten times as much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jorin, would you teach me to do what you were just
doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Windfinder stared, her dark eyes wide and shining
in the fading light. &ldquo;Teach you? But you are Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jorin, I have never woven a flow half as thick as
those you were handling. And the scope of it! I am astounded,
Jorin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Windfinder stared a moment more, no longer in
amazement, but as if trying to fix Elayne&rsquo;s face in her mind.
Finally she kissed the fingers of her right hand and pressed them
to Elayne&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;If it pleases the Light, we both shall
learn.&rdquo;</p>
