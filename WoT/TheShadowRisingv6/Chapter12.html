<h4><em>Tanchico or the Tower</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">E</span>layne
drew a ragged, relieved breath as Egwene
finally stirred and opened her eyes. At the foot of the bed,
Aviendha&rsquo;s features lost their tinge of frustration and anxiety,
and she flashed a quick smile that Egwene returned. The candle had
burned past the mark minutes ago; it seemed an hour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would not wake up, &ldquo;Elayne said unsteadily. &ldquo;I
shook you and shook you, but you would not wake.&rdquo; She gave a small
laugh. &ldquo;Oh, Egwene, you even frightened Aviendha.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene put a hand on her arm and squeezed
reassuringly. &ldquo;I am back, now.&rdquo; She sounded tired, and she had
sweated her shift through. &ldquo;I suppose I had reason to stay a little
longer than we planned. I will be more careful next time. I
promise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve returned the pitcher of water to the
washstand vigorously, sloshing some out. She had been on the point
of throwing it in Egwene&rsquo;s sleeping face. Her features were
composed, but the pitcher rattled the washbowl, and she let the
spilled water drip to the carpet. &ldquo;Was it something you found? Or
was it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Egwene, if the World of Dreams can hold on to you in
some way, maybe it is too dangerous until you learn more. Maybe the
more often you go, the harder it is to come back. Maybe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I
don&rsquo;t know. But I do know we cannot risk letting you become lost.&rdquo;
She crossed her arms under her breasts, ready for an argument.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Egwene said, very close to meekly. Elayne&rsquo;s
eyebrows shot up; Egwene was never meek with Nynaeve. Anything
but.</p>

<p>Egwene struggled off the bed, refusing Elayne&rsquo;s help,
and made her way to the washstand to bathe her face and arms in the
relatively cool water. Elayne found a dry shift in the wardrobe
while Egwene pulled off her sodden one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I met a Wise One, a woman named Amys.&rdquo; Egwene&rsquo;s
voice was muffled until her head popped out of the top of the new
shift. &ldquo;She said I should come to her, to learn about
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. At some place in the Waste called Cold
Rocks Hold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne had caught a flicker of Aviendha&rsquo;s eye at the
mention of the Wise One&rsquo;s name. &ldquo;Do you know her? Amys?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aiel woman&rsquo;s nod could only be described as
reluctant. &ldquo;A Wise One. A dreamwalker: Amys was <em>Far Dareis
Mai</em> until she gave up the spear to go to Rhuidean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Maiden!&rdquo; Egwene exclaimed. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why she&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;No matter. She said she is at Rhuidean, now. Do you know where
this Cold Rocks Hold is, Aviendha?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. Cold Rocks is Rhuarc&rsquo;s hold. Rhuarc is
Amys&rsquo;s husband. I visit there, sometimes. I used to. My
sister-mother, Lian, is sister-wife to Amys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne exchanged confused glances with Egwene and
Nynaeve. Once Elayne had thought she knew a good bit about Aiel,
all learned from her teachers in Caemlyn, but she had discovered
since meeting Aviendha how little she did know. Customs and
relationships all were a maze. First-sisters meant having the same
mother; except that it was possible for friends to <em>become</em>
first-sisters by making a pledge before Wise Ones. Second-sisters
meant your mothers were sisters; if your fathers were brothers, you
were father-sisters, and not considered as closely related as
second-sisters. After that, it truly grew bewildering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does &lsquo;sister-wife&rsquo; mean?&rdquo; she asked
hesitantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you have the same husband.&rdquo; Aviendha frowned at
the way Egwene gasped and Nynaeve&rsquo;s eyes opened as wide as they
would go. Elayne had been half-expecting the answer, but she still
found herself fussing with skirts that were perfectly straight.
&ldquo;This is not your custom?&rdquo; the Aiel woman asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Egwene said faintly. &ldquo;No, it is not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you and Elayne care for one another as
first-sisters. What would you have done had one of you been
unwilling to step aside for Rand al&rsquo;Thor? Fight over him? Let a man
damage the ties between you? Would it not have been better if you
both had married him, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne looked at Egwene. The thought of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Could
she have done such a thing? Even with Egwene? She knew her cheeks
were red. Egwene merely looked startled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I wanted to step aside,&rdquo; Egwene said.</p>

<p>Elayne knew the remark was as much for her as for
Aviendha, but the thought would not go away. Had Min had a viewing?
What would she do if Min had? <em>If it&rsquo;s Berelain, I will strangle
her, and him too! If it has to be someone, why couldn&rsquo;t it be
Egwene? Light, what am I thinking?</em> She knew she was becoming
flustered, and to cover it, she made her voice light. &ldquo;You sound as
if the man has no choice in the matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can say no,&rdquo; Aviendha said as if it were obvious,
&ldquo;but if he wishes to marry one, he must marry both when they ask.
Please take no offense, but I was shocked when I learned that in
your lands a man can ask a woman to marry him. A man should make
his interest known, then wait for the woman to speak. Of course,
some women lead a man to see where his interest lies, but the right
of the question is hers. I do not really know very much of these
things. I have wanted to be <em>Far Dareis Mai</em> since I was a
child. All I want in life is the spear and my spear-sisters,&rdquo; she
finished quite fiercely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one is going to try to make you marry,&rdquo; Egwene
said soothingly. Aviendha gave her a startled look.</p>

<p>Nynaeve cleared her throat loudly. Elayne wondered if
she had been thinking about Lan; there were certainly hard spots of
color in her cheeks. &ldquo;I suppose, Egwene,&rdquo; Nynaeve said in a
slightly too energetic voice, &ldquo;that you did not find what you were
looking for, or you would have said something by now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I found nothing,&rdquo; Egwene replied regretfully. &ldquo;But
Amys said&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Aviendha, what sort of woman is Amys?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aiel woman had taken up a study of the carpet.
&ldquo;Amys is hard as the mountains and pitiless as the sun,&rdquo; she said
without looking up. &ldquo;She is a dreamwalker. She can teach you. Once
she lays her hands on you, she will drag you by the hair toward
what she wants. Rhuarc is the only one who can stand up to her.
Even the other Wise Ones step carefully when Amys speaks. But she
can teach you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene shook her head. &ldquo;I meant would being in a
strange place unsettle her, make her nervous? Being in a city?
Would she see things that weren&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha&rsquo;s laugh was a short, sharp sound. &ldquo;Nervous?
Waking to find a lion in her bed would not make Amys nervous. She
was a Maiden, Egwene, and she has grown no softer, you can be sure
of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did this woman see?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t something she saw, exactly,&rdquo; Egwene said
slowly. &ldquo;I <em>think</em> not seeing. She said Tanchico had an evil
in it. Worse than men could make, she said. That could be the Black
Ajah. Don&rsquo;t argue with me, Nynaeve,&rdquo; she added in a firmer voice.
&ldquo;Dreams have to be interpreted. It very well could be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve had begun frowning as soon as Egwene
mentioned evil in Tanchico, and her frown turned to a heated glare
when Egwene told her not to argue. Sometimes Elayne wanted to shake
both women. She stepped in quickly, before the older woman could
erupt, &ldquo;It very well could be, Egwene. You did find something. More
than Nynaeve or I thought you could. Didn&rsquo;t she, Nynaeve? Don&rsquo;t you
think so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It could be,&rdquo; Nynaeve said grudgingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It could be.&rdquo; Egwene did not sound happy about it.
She took a deep breath. &ldquo;Nynaeve is right. I have to learn what I&rsquo;m
doing. If I knew what I should, I would not have had to be told
about the evil. If I knew what I should, I could have found the
very room Liandrin is staying in, wherever she is. Amys can teach
me. That is why&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;That is why I have to go to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go to her?&rdquo; Nynaeve sounded appalled. &ldquo;Into the
Waste?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aviendha can take me right to this Cold Rocks Hold.&rdquo;
Egwene&rsquo;s look, half-defiant, half-anxious, darted between Elayne
and Nynaeve. &ldquo;If I was certain they were in Tanchico, I wouldn&rsquo;t
let you go alone. If you decide to. But with Amys to help me, maybe
I can find out where they are. Maybe I can&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;That is just it; I
do not even know what I&rsquo;ll be able to do, only that I am certain it
will be far more than I can now. It isn&rsquo;t as if I will be
abandoning you. You can take the ring with you. You know the Stone
well enough to come back here in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. I can
come to you in Tanchico. Whatever I learn from Amys, I can teach
you. Please say you understand. I can learn so much from Amys, and
then I can use it to help you. It will be as if all three of us had
been trained by her. A dreamwalker; a woman who <em>knows!</em>
Liandrin and the rest of them will be like children; they won&rsquo;t
know a quarter of what we do.&rdquo; She chewed her lip, one pensive
bite. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe I am running out on you, do you? If you
do, I won&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you must go,&rdquo; Elayne told her. &ldquo;I will
miss you, but no one promised us we could stay together until this
was done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the two of you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;going alone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I should
go with you. If they really are in Tanchico, I should be with
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; Nynaeve said briskly. &ldquo;Training is what
you need. That will do us far more good in the long run than your
company to Tanchico. It isn&rsquo;t even as if we know any of them are in
Tanchico. If they are, Elayne and I will do very well together, but
we could arrive and find that this evil is no more than the war
after all. The Light knows, war should be evil enough for anyone.
We may be back in the Tower before you are. You must be careful in
the Waste,&rdquo; she added in a practical tone. &ldquo;It is a dangerous
place. Aviendha, you will look after her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before the Aiel woman could open her mouth, there was
a knock at the door, followed immediately by Moiraine. The Aes
Sedai took them in with one sweeping look that weighed, measured
and considered them and what they had been doing, all without the
twitch of an eyelid to suggest her conclusions. &ldquo;Joiya and Amico
are dead,&rdquo; she announced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was that the reason for the attack, then?&rdquo; Nynaeve
said. &ldquo;All that to kill them? Or perhaps to kill them if they could
not be freed. I&rsquo;ve been sure Joiya was so confident because she
expected rescue. She must have been lying after all. I never
trusted her repentance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not the main purpose, perhaps,&rdquo; Moiraine replied.
&ldquo;The captain very wisely kept his men to their posts in the
dungeons during the attack. They never saw a single Trolloc or
Myrddraal. But they found the pair dead, after. Each with her
throat rather messily cut. After her tongue had been nailed to her
cell door.&rdquo; She might as well have been speaking of having a dress
mended.</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s stomach heaved leadenly at the detached
description. &ldquo;I would not have wanted that for them. Not like that.
The Light illumine their souls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They sold their souls to the Shadow long ago,&rdquo;
Egwene said roughly. She had both hands pressed to her stomach,
though. &ldquo;How&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;How was it done? Gray Men?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt even Gray Men could have managed that,&rdquo;
Moiraine said dryly. &ldquo;The Shadow has resources beyond what we know,
it seems.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Egwene smoothed her dress, and her voice. &ldquo;If
there was no attempt at rescue, it must mean they were both telling
the truth. They were killed because they talked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or to stop them from it,&rdquo; Nynaeve added grimly. &ldquo;We
can hope they do not know that those two told us anything. Perhaps
Joiya did repent, but I&rsquo;ll not believe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne swallowed, thinking of being in a cell, having
your face pressed to the door so your tongue could be pulled out
and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She shivered, but made herself say, &ldquo;They might have been
killed simply to punish them for being captured.&rdquo; She left out her
thought that the killing might have been to make them believe
whatever Joiya and Amico had said; they had enough doubts about
what to do as it was. &ldquo;Three possibilities, and only one says the
Black Ajah knows they revealed a word. Since all three are equal,
the chances are that they do not know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene and Nynaeve looked shocked. &ldquo;To
<em>punish</em> them?&rdquo; Nynaeve said incredulously.</p>

<p>They were both tougher than she in many ways&mdash;she admired them for it&mdash;but they had not grown up watching
the maneuverings at court in Caemlyn, hearing tales of the cruel
way Cairhienin and Tairens played the Games of Houses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think the Black Ajah might be less than gentle
with failure of any kind,&rdquo; she told them. &ldquo;I can imagine Liandrin
ordering it. Joiya surely could have done it easily.&rdquo; Moiraine eyed
her briefly, a reassessing look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Liandrin,&rdquo; Egwene said, her tone absolutely flat.
&ldquo;Yes, I can imagine Liandrin or Joiya giving that command.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not have much longer to question them in any
case,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;They would have been shipbound by midday
tomorrow.&rdquo; A hint of anger touched her voice; Elayne realized
Moiraine must see the Black sisters&rsquo; deaths as an escape from
justice. &ldquo;I hope you reach some decision soon. Tanchico or the
Tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne met Nynaeve&rsquo;s eyes and gave a slight nod.</p>

<p>Nynaeve nodded back, more assertively, before turning
to the Aes Sedai. &ldquo;Elayne and I will be going to Tanchico as soon
as we can find a ship. A fast ship, I hope. Egwene and Aviendha
will be going to Cold Rocks Hold, in the Aiel Waste.&rdquo; She gave no
reasons, and Moiraine&rsquo;s eyebrows rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jolien can take her,&rdquo; Aviendha said into the
momentary silence. She avoided looking at Egwene. &ldquo;Or Sefela, or
Bain and Chiad. I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I have a thought to go with Elayne and
Nynaeve. If there is war in this Tanchico, they have need of a
sister to watch their backs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that is what you want, Aviendha,&rdquo; Egwene said
slowly.</p>

<p>She looked surprised and hurt, but no more surprised
than Elayne. She had thought the two of them were becoming friends.
&ldquo;I am glad you want to help us, Aviendha, but you should be the one
to take Egwene to Cold Rocks Hold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is going neither to Tanchico nor Cold Rocks
Hold,&rdquo; Moiraine said, taking a letter from her pouch and unfolding
the pages. &ldquo;This was placed in my hand an hour gone. The young
Aielman who brought it told me it was given to him a month ago,
before any of us reached Tear, yet it is addressed to me by name,
at the Stone of Tear.&rdquo; She glanced at the last sheet. &ldquo;Aviendha, do
you know Amys, of the Nine Valleys sept of the Taardad Aiel; Bair,
of the Haido sept of the Shaarad Aiel; Melaine, of the Jhirad sept
of the Goshien Aiel; and Seana, of the Black Cliff sept of the
Nakai Aiel? They signed it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are all Wise Ones, Aes Sedai. All
dreamwalkers.&rdquo; Aviendha&rsquo;s stance had shifted to wariness, though
she did not seem aware of it. She looked ready to fight or
flee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dreamwalkers,&rdquo; Moiraine mused. &ldquo;Perhaps that
explains it. I have heard of dreamwalkers.&rdquo; She turned to the
second page of the letter. &ldquo;Here is what they say about you. What
they said perhaps before you had even decided to come to Tear.
&lsquo;There is among the Maidens of the Spear in the Stone of Tear a
willful girl called Aviendha, of the Nine Valleys sept of the
Taardad Aiel. She must now come to us. There can be no more waiting
or excuses. We will await her on the slopes of Chaendaer, above
Rhuidean.&rsquo; There is more about you, but mainly telling me that I
must see you come to them without delay. They issue commands like
the Amyrlin, these Wise Ones of yours,&rdquo; She made a vexed sound,
which brought Elayne to wonder if the Wise Ones had tried issuing
commands to the Aes Sedai, too. Not very likely. And unlikely to be
successful if tried. Still, something about that letter irritated
the Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am <em>Far Dareis Mai</em>,&rdquo; Aviendha said
angrily. &ldquo;I do not go running like a child when someone calls my
name. I will go to Tanchico if I wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne pursed her lips thoughtfully. This was
something new from the Aiel woman. Not the anger&mdash;she had
seen Aviendha angry before, if not quite to this degree&mdash;but
the undertone. She could call it nothing but sulkiness. That seemed
as unlikely as Lan being sulky, but there it was.</p>

<p>Egwene heard it, too. She patted Aviendha&rsquo;s arm.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right. If you want to go to Tanchico, I&rsquo;ll be pleased
that you are protecting Elayne and Nynaeve.&rdquo; Aviendha gave her a
truly miserable look.</p>

<p>Moiraine shook her head, only slightly, but still
deliberate. &ldquo;I showed this to Rhuarc.&rdquo; Aviendha opened her mouth,
her face irate, but the Aes Sedai raised her voice and went on
smoothly. &ldquo;As the letter asks me to. Only the part concerning you,
of course. He seems quite determined that you will do as the letter
asks. As it orders. I think it wisest to do as Rhuarc and the Wise
Ones wish, Aviendha, Do you not agree?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha stared around the room wildly, as at a trap.
&ldquo;I am <em>Far Dareis Mai</em>,&rdquo; she muttered, and strode for the
door without another word.</p>

<p>Egwene took a step, half-raising a hand to stop her,
then let it fall as the door banged shut. &ldquo;What do they want with
her?&rdquo; she demanded of Moiraine. &ldquo;You always know more than you let
on. What are you holding back this time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever the Wise Ones&rsquo; reason,&rdquo; Moiraine said
coolly, &ldquo;it is surely a matter between Aviendha and them. If she
wished you to know, she would have told you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot stop trying to maneuver people,&rdquo; Nynaeve
said bitterly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re maneuvering Aviendha into something now,
aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not I. The Wise Ones. And Rhuarc.&rdquo; Moiraine folded
the letter, returning it to her belt pouch with a touch of acerbity
in her manner. &ldquo;She can always say no to him. A clan chief is not
the same as a king, as I understand Aiel ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can she?&rdquo; Elayne asked. Rhuarc reminded her of
Gareth Bryne. The Captain-General of her mother&rsquo;s Royal Guards had
seldom put his foot down, but when he did, not even Morgase could
bring him around, short of a royal command. There would be no
command from the throne this time&mdash;not that Morgase had ever
issued one to Gareth Bryne when he had decided he was right, now
that Elayne thought of it&mdash;and without one, she expected that
Aviendha was going to the slopes of Chaendaer, above Rhuidean. &ldquo;At
least she can journey with you, Egwene. Amys can hardly meet you at
Cold Rocks Hold if she plans to wait for Aviendha at Rhuidean. You
can go to Amys together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I do not want her to,&rdquo; Egwene said sadly. &ldquo;Not
if she doesn&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever anyone wants,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, &ldquo;we have work
to do. You will need many things for a trip into the Waste, Egwene.
Lan will tell me what. And Elayne and I must make preparations to
sail for Tanchico. I suppose we can find a ship tomorrow, but that
means deciding what to pack tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a ship of the Atha&rsquo;an Miere at the docks in
the Maule,&rdquo; Moiraine told them. &ldquo;A raker. There are no ships
faster. You did want a fast ship.&rdquo; Nynaeve gave a grudging nod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moiraine,&rdquo; Elayne said, &ldquo;what is Rand going to do
now? After this attack&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Will he start the war you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not want a war,&rdquo; the Aes Sedai replied. &ldquo;I want
what will see him alive to fight Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don. He says he will
tell us all what he means to do tomorrow.&rdquo; The smallest frown
creased her smooth forehead. &ldquo;Tomorrow, we will all know more than
we do tonight.&rdquo; Her departure was abrupt.</p>

<p><em>Tomorrow</em>, Elayne thought. <em>What will he
do when I tell him? What will he say? He has to understand</em>.
Determinedly, she joined the other two to discuss their
preparations.</p>
