<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">F</span>orward, and back.</p>

<p>Adan lay in the sandy hollow clutching his dead son&rsquo;s
weeping children, shielding their eyes against his ragged coat.
Tears rolled down his face, too, but silently, as he peered
cautiously over the edge. At five and six, Maigran and Lewin
deserved the right to cry; Adan was surprised he had any tears
left, himself.</p>

<p>Some of the wagons were burning. The dead lay where
they had fallen. The horses had already been driven off, except for
those still hitched to a few wagons that had been emptied onto the
ground. For once he took no notice of the crated things the Aes
Sedai had given into Aiel charge, toppled carelessly into the dirt.
It was not the first time he had seen that, or dead Aiel, but this
time he could not care. The men with the swords and spears and
bows, the men who had done the killing, were loading those empty
wagons. With women. He watched Rhea, his daughter, shoved up into a
wagon box with the others, crowded together like animals by
laughing killers. The last of his children. Elwin dead of hunger at
ten, Sorelle at twenty of fever her dreams told her was coming, and
Jaren, who threw himself off a cliff a year ago, at nineteen, when
he found he could channel. Marind, this morning.</p>

<p>He wanted to scream. He wanted to rush out there and
stop them from taking his last child. Stop them, somehow. And if he
did rush out? They would kill him, and take Rhea anyway. They might
well kill the children, too. Some of those bodies sprawled in their
own blood were small.</p>

<p>Maigran clutched at him as if she sensed he might
leave her, and Lewin stiffened as if he wanted to hold tighter but
thought himself too old. Adan smoothed their hair and kept their
faces pressed against his chest. He made himself watch, though,
until the wagons wheeled away surrounded by whooping riders, after
the horses that were already almost out of sight toward the smoking
mountains that lined the horizon.</p>

<p>Only then did he stand up, prying the children loose.
&ldquo;Wait here for me,&rdquo; he told them. &ldquo;Wait until I come back.&rdquo;
Clinging to each other, they stared at him with tear-stained white
faces, nodded uncertainly.</p>

<p>He walked out to one of the bodies, rolled her over
gently. Siedre could have been asleep, her face just the way it
appeared beside him when he woke each morning. It always surprised
him to notice gray in her red-gold hair; she was his love, his
life, and ever young and new to him. He tried not to look at the
blood soaking the front of her dress or the gaping wound below her
breasts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean to do now, Adan? Tell us that!
What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He brushed Seidre&rsquo;s hair from her face&mdash;she liked to
be neat&mdash;and stood, turning slowly to confront the knot of angry,
frightened men. Sulwin was the leader, a tall man with deep-set
eyes. He had let his hair grow, Sulwin had, as if to hide being
Aiel. A number of men had. It had made no difference, to these last
raiders or those who had come before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean to bury our dead and go on, Sulwin.&rdquo; His eyes
drifted back to Siedre. &ldquo;What else is there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on, Adan? How can we go on? There are no horses.
There is almost no water, no food. All we have left are wagons full
of things the Aes Sedai will never come for. What are they, Adan?
What are they that we should give our lives to haul them across the
world, afraid to touch them even. We cannot go on as before!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can!&rdquo; Adan shouted. &ldquo;We will! We have legs; we
have backs. We will drag the wagons, if need be. We will be
faithful to our duty!&rdquo; He was startled to see his own brandished
fist. A fist. His hand trembled as he unclenched it and put it down
by side.</p>

<p>Sulwin stepped back, then held his ground with his
companions. &ldquo;No, Adan. We are supposed to find a place of safety,
and some of us mean to do that. My greatfather used to tell me
stories he heard as a boy, stories of when we lived in safety and
people came to hear us sing. We mean to find a place where we can
be safe, and sing again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sing?&rdquo; Adan scoffed. &ldquo;I have heard those old
stories, too, that Aiel singing was a wondrous thing, but you know
those old songs no more than I do. The songs are gone, and the old
days are gone. We will not give up our duty to the Aes Sedai to
chase after what is lost forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of us will, Adan.&rdquo; The others behind Sulwin
nodded. &ldquo;We mean to find that safe place. And the songs, too. We
will!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A crash whipped Adan&rsquo;s head around. More of Sulwin&rsquo;s
cronies were unloading one of the wagons, and a large flat crate
had fallen, half breaking open to reveal what looked like a
polished doorframe of dark red stone. Other wagons were being
emptied, too, and by more than Sulwin&rsquo;s friends. At least a quarter
of the people he saw were hard at work clearing wagons of
everything but food or water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not try to stop us,&rdquo; Sulwin cautioned.</p>

<p>Adan made his fist loosen again. &ldquo;You are not Aiel,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;You betray everything. Whatever you are, you are no
longer Aiel!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We keep the Way of the Leaf as well as you,
Adan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; Adan shouted. &ldquo;Go! You are not Aiel! You are
lost! Lost! I do not want to look at you! Go!&rdquo; Sulwin and the
others stumbled in their haste to get away from him.</p>

<p>His heart sank lower as he surveyed the wagons, and
the dead lying among the litter. So many dead, so many wounded
moaning as they were tended. Sulwin and his lost ones were taking
some care in their unloading. The men with the swords had broken
open crates until they realized there was no gold inside, no food.
Food was more precious than gold. Adan studied the stone doorframe,
tumbled piles of stone figurines, odd shapes in crystal standing
among the potted chora cuttings Sulwin&rsquo;s folk had no use for. Was
there a use for any of it? Was this what they were being faithful
for? If it was, then so be it. Some could be saved. There was no
way to tell what Aes Sedai might consider most important, but some
could be saved.</p>

<p>He saw Maigran and Lewin clutching their mother&rsquo;s
skirts. He was glad Saralin was alive to look after them; his last
son, her husband, the children&rsquo;s father, had died from the very
first arrow that morning. Some could be saved. He would save the
Aiel, whatever it took.</p>

<p>Kneeling, he gathered Siedre in his arms. &ldquo;We are
still faithful, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;How long must we be
faithful?&rdquo; Putting his head down on his wife&rsquo;s breast, he wept.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Tears stung Rand&rsquo;s eyes; silently, he mouthed,
&ldquo;<em>Siedre</em>.&rdquo; The Way of the Leaf? That was no Aiel belief. He
could not think dearly; he could hardly think at all. The lights
spun faster and faster. Beside him, Muradin&rsquo;s mouth was open in a
soundless howl; the Aiel&rsquo;s eyes bulged as if witnessing the death
of everything. They stepped forward together.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Jonai stood at the edge of the cliff staring out
westward over the sun-sparkled water. A hundred leagues in that
direction lay Comelle. Had lain Comelle. Comelle had clung to the
mountains overlooking the sea. A hundred leagues west, where the
sea now ran. If Alnora were still alive, perhaps it would have been
easier to take. Without her dreams, he scarcely knew where to go or
what to do. Without her, he hardly cared to live. He felt every
gray hair as he turned to trudge back to the wagons, waiting a mile
away. Fewer wagons, now, and showing wear. Fewer people, too, a
handful of thousands where there had been tens. But too many for
the remaining wagons. No one rode now save children too small to
walk.</p>

<p>Adan met him at the first wagon, a tall young man,
his blue eyes too wary. Jonai always expected to see Willim if he
looked around quickly enough. But Willim had been sent away, of
course, years ago, when he began to channel no matter how hard he
tried to stop. The world had too many men channeling, still; they
had to send away boys who showed the signs. They had to. But he
wished he had his children back. When had Esole died? So little to
be laid in a hastily dug hole, wasted with sickness there was no
Aes Sedai to Heal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are Ogier, father,&rdquo; Adan said excitedly. Jonai
suspected his son had always thought his stories of the Ogier were
just that, stories. &ldquo;They came from the north.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a bedraggled band Adan led him to, no more
than fifty in number, hollow-cheeked, sad-eyed, tufted ears
drooping. He had become accustomed to his own people&rsquo;s drawn faces
and worn, patched clothing, but seeing the same on Ogier shocked
him. Yet he had people to care for, and duties to discharge for the
Aes Sedai. How long since he had seen an Aes Sedai? Just after
Alnora died. Too late for Alnora. The woman had Healed the sick who
still lived, taken some of the <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>, and gone on her
way, laughing bitterly when he asked her where there was a place of
safety. Her dress had been patched, and worn at the hem. He was not
sure she had been sane. She claimed one of the Forsaken was only
partly trapped, or maybe not at all; Ishamael still touched the
world, she said. She had to be as mad as the remaining male Aes
Sedai.</p>

<p>He pulled his mind back to the Ogier as they stood,
unsteady on their great legs. His thoughts wandered too much since
Alnora&rsquo;s death. They had bread and bowls in their hands. He was
shocked to feel a prick of anger that someone had shared their
meager stock of food. How many of his people could eat on what
fifty Ogier could consume? No. To share was the way. To give
freely. A hundred people? Two hundred?</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have chora cuttings,&rdquo; one of the Ogier said. His
thick fingers gently brushed the trefoil leaves of the two potted
plants tied to the side of a wagon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some,&rdquo; Adan said curtly. &ldquo;They die, but the old folk
keep new cuttings before they do.&rdquo; He had no time for trees. He had
a people to look after. &ldquo;How bad is it in the north?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bad,&rdquo; an Ogier woman replied. &ldquo;The Blighted Lands
have grown southward, and there are Myrddraal and Trollocs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought they were all dead.&rdquo; Not north, then. They
could not turn north. South? The Sea of Jeren lay ten days south.
Or did it, any longer? He was tired. So tired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have come from the east?&rdquo; another Ogier asked.
He wiped his bowl with a heel of bread and gulped it down. &ldquo;How is
it to the east?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bad,&rdquo; Jonai replied. &ldquo;Perhaps not so bad for you,
though. Ten&mdash;no, twelve days ago, some people took a third of
our horses before we could escape. We had to abandon wagons.&rdquo; That
pained him. Wagons left behind, and what was in them. The things
the Aes Sedai had placed in Aiel charge, abandoned. That it was not
the first time only made it worse. &ldquo;Almost everyone we meet takes
things, whatever they want. Perhaps they will not be so with Ogier,
though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; an Ogier woman said as if she did not
believe it. Jonai was not certain he did either; there was no safe
place. &ldquo;Do you know where any of the <em>stedding</em> are?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jonai stared at her. &ldquo;No. No, I do not. But surely
you can find the <em>stedding</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have run so far, so long,&rdquo; an Ogier back in the
huddle said, and another added in a mournful rumble, &ldquo;The land has
changed so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we must find a <em>stedding</em> soon or
die,&rdquo; the first Ogier woman said. &ldquo;I feel a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;longing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;in
my bones. We must find a <em>stedding</em>. We must.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot help you,&rdquo; Jonai said sadly. He felt a
tightness in his chest. The land changed beyond knowing, changing
still so the plain traveled last year might be mountains this. The
Blighted Lands growing. Myrddraal and Trollocs still alive. People
stealing, people with faces like animals, people who did not
recognize Da&rsquo;shain or know them. He could barely breathe. The
Ogier, lost. The Aiel, lost. Everything lost. The tightness broke
in pain, and he sank to his knees, doubled over, clutching his
chest. A fist held his heart, squeezing.</p>

<p>Adan knelt beside him worriedly. &ldquo;Father, what is it?
What is the matter? What can I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jonai managed to seize his son&rsquo;s frayed collar and
pull his face close. &ldquo;Take&mdash;the people&mdash;south.&rdquo; He had
to force the words out between spasms that seemed to be ripping his
heart out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father, you are the one who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen. Listen! Take them&mdash;south. Take&mdash;the Aiel&mdash;to safety. Keep&mdash;the Covenant. Guard&mdash;what the Aes Sedai&mdash;gave us&mdash;until they&mdash;come for
it. The Way&mdash;of the Leaf. You must&mdash;&rdquo; He had tried.
Solinda Sedai must understand that. He had tried. Alnora.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Alnora. The name faded, the pain in Rand&rsquo;s chest
loosened. No sense. It made no sense. How could these people be
Aiel?</p>

<p>The columns flashed in blinding pulses. The air
stirred, swirling.</p>

<p>Beside him, Muradin&rsquo;s mouth stretched wide in an
effort to scream. The Aiel clawed at his veil, clawed at his face,
leaving deep bloody scratches.</p>

<p>Forward.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Jonai hurried down the empty streets, trying not to
look at shattered buildings and dead chora trees. All dead. At
least the last of the long abandoned jo-cars had been hauled away.
Aftershocks still troubled the ground beneath his feet. He wore his
work clothes, his <em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em>, of course, though the work he had been
given was nothing he had been trained for. He was sixty-three, in
the prime of life, not yet old enough for gray hairs, but he felt a
tired old man.</p>

<p>No one questioned his entering the Hall of the
Servants; there was no one at the great columned entrance to
question anyone, or give greeting. Plenty of people darted about
inside, arms filled with papers or boxes, eyes anxious, but none so
much as looked at him. There was a feel of panic about them, and it
grew by increments every time the ground shook. Distressed, he
crossed the anteroom and trotted up the broad stairs. Mud stained
the silvery white elstone. No one could spare time. Perhaps no one
cared.</p>

<p>There was no need to knock at the door he sought. Not
one of the great gilded doors to an ingathering hall, but a door
plain and unobtrusive. He slipped in quietly, though, and was glad
he had. Half a dozen Aes Sedai stood around the long table,
arguing, apparently not noticing when the building trembled. They
were all women.</p>

<p>He shivered, wondering if men would ever stand in a
meeting such as this again. When he saw what was on the table, the
shiver became a shudder. A crystal sword&mdash;perhaps an object of the
Power, perhaps only an ornament; he had no way of telling&mdash;held down
the Dragon banner of Lews Therin Kinslayer, spread out like a
tablecloth and spilling onto the floor. His heart clenched. What
was that doing here? Why had it not been destroyed, and memory of
the cursed man as well?</p>

<p>&ldquo;What good is your Foretelling,&rdquo; Oselle was almost
shouting, &ldquo;if you cannot tell us when?&rdquo; Her long black hair swayed
as she shook with anger. &ldquo;The world rests on this! The future! The
Wheel itself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dark eyed Deindre faced her with a more usual calm.
&ldquo;I am not the Creator. I can only tell you what I Foretell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peace, sisters.&rdquo; Solinda was the calmest of them
all, her old-fashioned streith gown only a pale blue mist. The
sun-red hair falling to her waist was nearly the color of his own. His
greatfather had served her as a young man, but she looked younger
than he; she was Aes Sedai. &ldquo;The time for contention among
ourselves is past. Jaric and Haindar will both be here by
tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which means we cannot afford mistakes, Solinda.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there any chance of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jonai stopped listening. They would see him when they
were ready. He was not the only one in the room besides the Aes
Sedai. Someshta sat against the wall near the door, a great shape
seemingly woven of vines and leaves, his head a little above
Jonai&rsquo;s even so. A fissure of withered brown and charred black ran
up the Nym&rsquo;s face and furrowed the green grass of his hair, and
when he looked at Jonai, his hazelnut eyes seemed troubled.</p>

<p>When Jonai nodded to him, he fingered the rift and
frowned. &ldquo;Do I know you?&rdquo; he said softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am your friend,&rdquo; Jonai replied sadly. He had not
seen Someshta in years, but he had heard of this. Most of the Nym
were dead, he had heard. &ldquo;You rode me on your shoulders when I was
a child. Do you remember nothing of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Singing,&rdquo; Someshta said. &ldquo;Was there singing? So much
is gone. The Aes Sedai say some will return. You are a Child of the
Dragon, are you not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jonai winced. That name had caused trouble, no less
for not being true. But how many citizens now believed the Da&rsquo;shain
Aiel had once served the Dragon and no other Aes Sedai?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jonai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned at the sound of Solinda&rsquo;s voice, went to
one knee as she approached. The others were still arguing, but more
quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All is in readiness, Jonai?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All, Aes Sedai. Solinda Sedai&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He hesitated,
took a deep breath. &ldquo;Solinda Sedai, some of us wish to remain. We
can serve, still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know what happened to the Aiel at Tzora?&rdquo; He
nodded, and she sighed, reaching out to smooth his short hair as if
he were a child. &ldquo;Of course you do. You Da&rsquo;shain have more courage
than&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Ten thousand Aiel linking arms and singing, trying to
remind a madman of who they were and who he had been, trying to
turn him with their bodies and a song. Jaric Mondoran killed them.
He stood there, staring as though at a puzzle, killing them, and
they kept closing their lines and singing. I am told he listened to
the last Aiel for almost an hour before destroying him. And then
Tzora burned, one huge flame consuming stone and metal and flesh.
There is a sheet of glass where the second greatest city in the
world once stood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many people had time to flee, Aes Sedai. The
Da&rsquo;shain earned them time to flee. We are not afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her hand tightened painfully in his hair. &ldquo;The
citizens have already fled Paaren Disen, Jonai. Besides, the
Da&rsquo;shain yet have a part yet to play, if Deindre could only see far
enough to say what. In any case, I mean to save something here, and
that something is you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you say,&rdquo; he said reluctantly. &ldquo;We will care for
what you have given into our charge until you want them again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. The things we gave you.&rdquo; She smiled at
him and loosened her grip, smoothing his hair once more before
folding her hands. &ldquo;You will carry the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;things&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to
safety, Jonai. Keep moving, always moving, until you find a place
of safety, where no one can harm you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you say, Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What of Coumin, Jonai? Has he calmed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not know any way but to tell her; he would
rather have bitten his tongue out. &ldquo;My father is hiding somewhere
in the city. He tried to talk us into&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;resisting. He would not
listen, Aes Sedai. He would not listen. He found an old shocklance
somewhere, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He could not go on. He expected her to be
angry, but her eyes glistened with tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep the Covenant, Jonai. If the Da&rsquo;shain lose
everything else, see they keep the Way of the Leaf. Promise
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; he said, shocked. The
Covenant was the Aiel, and the Aiel were the Covenant; to abandon
the Way would be to abandon what they were. Coumin was an
aberration. He had been strange since he was a boy, it was said,
hardly Aiel at all, though no one knew why.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go now, Jonai. I want you far from Paaren Disen by
tomorrow. And remember&mdash;keep moving. Keep the Aiel safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He bowed where he knelt, but she was already being
drawn back into the argument.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can we trust Kodam and his fellows, Solinda?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must, Oselle. They are young and inexperienced,
but barely touched by the taint, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;And we have no
choice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we will do what we must. The sword must wait.
Someshta, we have a task for the last of the Nym, if you will do
it. We have asked too much of you; now we must ask more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jonai bowed his way out formally as the Nym rose, his
head brushing the ceiling. Already immersed in their plans, they
were not looking at him, but he did them this last honor anyway. He
did not think he would ever see them again.</p>

<p>He ran from the Hall of the Servants, all the way out
of the city to where the great gathering waited. Thousands of
wagons in ten lines stretching nearly two leagues, wagons loaded
with food and water barrels, wagons loaded with the crated things
the Aes Sedai had given into Aiel charge, <em>angreal</em> and <em>
sa&rsquo;angreal</em> and <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, all the things that had
to be kept from the hands of men going mad while they wielded the
One Power. Once there would have been other ways to carry them,
jo-cars and jumpers, hoverflies and huge sho-wings. Now painfully
assembled horses and wagons had to suffice. Among the wagons stood
the people, enough to populate a city but perhaps all the Aiel left
alive in the world.</p>

<p>A hundred came to meet him, men and women, the
representatives demanding word of whether the Aes Sedai had granted
leave for some to stay. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he told them. Some frowned
reluctantly, and he added, &ldquo;We must obey. We are Da&rsquo;shain Aiel, and
we obey the Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They dispersed back to their wagons slowly, and he
thought he heard Coumin&rsquo;s name mentioned, but he could not let it
trouble him. He hurried to his own wagon, at the head of one of the
center lines. The horses were all nervous with the ground shaking
at intervals.</p>

<p>His sons were already up on the seat&mdash;Willim,
fifteen, with the reins, and Adan, ten, beside him, both grinning
with nervous excitement. Little Esole lay playing with a doll on
top of the canvas tied over their possessions&mdash;and, more
important, their charges from the Aes Sedai. There was no room for
any to ride but the young and the very old. A dozen rooted chora
cuttings in clay pots sat behind the wagon seat, to be planted when
they found a place of safety. A foolish thing to carry, perhaps,
but no wagon was without its potted cuttings. Something from a time
long gone; symbol of a better time to come. People needed hope, and
symbols.</p>

<p>Alnora waited beside the team, glossy black hair
tumbling about her shoulders and reminding him of the first time he
saw her as a girl. But worry had etched lines around her eyes
now.</p>

<p>He managed a smile for her, hiding the worry in his
own heart. &ldquo;All will be well, wife of my heart.&rdquo; She did not
answer, and he added, &ldquo;Have you dreamed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of no time soon,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;All will be well,
all will be well, and all manner of thing will be well.&rdquo; Smiling
tremulously, she touched his cheek. &ldquo;With you I know it will be so,
husband of my heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jonai waved his arms over his head, and the signal
rippled down the lines. Slowly the wagons began to move, the Aiel
leaving Paaren Disen.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Rand shook his head. Too much. Memories crowding
together. The air seemed filled with sheet lightning. The wind
swirled gritty dust into dancing whirlwinds. Muradin had clawed
deep furrows in his face; he was digging at his eyes now.
Forward.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Coumin knelt at the edge of the plowed ground in his
working clothes, plain brownish gray coat and breeches and soft
laced boots, in a line with others like him that surrounded the
field, ten men of the Da&rsquo;shain Aiel at twice stretched arms&rsquo; length
and then an Ogier, all the way around. He could see the next field,
lined the same way, beyond the soldiers with their shocklances
sitting atop armored jo-cars. A hoverfly buzzed overhead in its
patrol, a deadly black metal wasp containing two men. He was
sixteen, and the women had decided his voice was finally deep
enough to join in the seed singing.</p>

<p>The soldiers fascinated him, men and Ogier, the way a
colorful poisonous snake might. They <em>killed</em>. His father&rsquo;s
greatfather, Charn, claimed there had been no soldiers once, but
Coumin did not believe it. If there were no soldiers, who would
stop the Nightriders and the Trollocs from coming to kill everyone?
Of course, Charn claimed there had not been any Myrddraal or
Trollocs then, either. No Forsaken, no Shadowwrought. He had many
stories he claimed were from a time before soldiers and Nightriders
and Trollocs, when he said the Dark Lord of the Grave had been
bound away, and no one knew his name, or the word &ldquo;war.&rdquo; Coumin
could not imagine such a world; the war had been old when he was
born.</p>

<p>He enjoyed Charn&rsquo;s stories even if he could not make
himself believe, but some earned the old man frowns and scoldings.
Like when he claimed to have served one of the Forsaken, once. Not
just any Forsaken, but Lanfear herself. As well say he had served
Ishamael. If Charn had to make up stories, Coumin wished he could
say he had served Lews Therin, the great leader himself. Of course,
everyone would ask why he was not serving the Dragon now, but that
would be better than the way things were. Coumin did not like the
way citizens looked at Charn when he said that Lanfear had not
always been evil.</p>

<p>A stir at the end of the field told him one of the
Nym was approaching. The great form, head and shoulders and chest
taller than any Ogier, stepped out onto the seeded ground, and
Coumin did not have to see to know he left footprints filled with
sprouting things. It was Someshta, surrounded by clouds of
butterflies, white and yellow and blue. Excited murmurs rose from
the townspeople and the folk whose fields these were, gathered to
watch. Each field would have its Nym, now.</p>

<p>Coumin wondered if he could ask Someshta about
Charn&rsquo;s stories. He had spoken to him once, and Someshta was old
enough to know if Charn was telling the truth; the Nym were older
than anyone. Some said the Nym never died, not so long as plants
grew. But this was no time to be thinking of questioning a Nym.</p>

<p>The Ogier began it, as was fitting, standing to sing,
great bass rumbles like the earth singing. The Aiel rose, men&rsquo;s
voices lifting in their own song, even the deepest at a higher
pitch than the Ogier&rsquo;s. Yet the songs braided together, and
Someshta took those threads and wove them into his dance, gliding
across the field in swooping strides, arms wide, butterflies
swirling about him, landing on his spread fingertips.</p>

<p>Coumin could hear the seed singing around the other
fields, hear the women clapping to urge the men on, their rhythm
the heartbeat of new life, but it was a distant knowledge. The song
caught him up, and he almost felt that it was himself, not the
sounds he made, that Someshta wove into the soil and around the
seeds. Seeds no longer, though. Zemais sprouts covered the field,
taller wherever the Nym&rsquo;s foot had trod. No blight would touch
those plants, nor any insect; seed sung, they would eventually grow
twice as high as a man and fill the town&rsquo;s grainbarns. This was
what he had been born for, this song and the other seed songs. He
did not regret the fact that the Aes Sedai had passed him over at
ten, saying he lacked the spark. To have been trained as Aes Sedai
would have been wondrous, but surely no more so than this
moment.</p>

<p>The song faded slowly, the Aiel guiding its end.
Someshta danced a few steps more after the last voices ceased, and
it seemed the song still hung faintly in the air for as long as he
moved. Then he stopped, and it was done.</p>

<p>Coumin was surprised to see that the townspeople were
gone, but he had no time to wonder where they had gone or why. The
women were coming, laughing, to congratulate the men. He was one of
the men now, not a boy any longer, though the women alternated
between kissing him on the lips and reaching up to ruffle his short
red hair.</p>

<p>It was then that he saw the soldier, only a few steps
away, watching them. He had left his shocklance and fancloth battle
cape somewhere, but he still wore his helmet, like some monstrous
insect&rsquo;s head, its mandibles hiding his face though his black
shockvisor was raised. As if realizing he still stood out, the
soldier pulled off the helmet, revealing a dark young man no more
than four or five years older than Coumin. The soldier&rsquo;s unblinking
brown eyes met his, and Coumin shivered. The face was only four or
five years older, but those eyes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The soldier would have been
chosen to begin his training at ten, too. Coumin was glad Aiel were
spared that choosing.</p>

<p>One of the Ogier, Tomada, came over, tufted ears
slanted forward inquisitively. &ldquo;Do you have news, warman? I saw
excitement among the jo-cars while we sang.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The soldier hesitated. &ldquo;I suppose I can tell you,
though it is not confirmed. We have a report that Lews Therin led
the Companions on a strike at Shayol Ghul this morning at dawn.
Something is disrupting communications, but the report is the Bore
has been sealed, with most of the Forsaken on the other side. Maybe
all of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it is over.&rdquo; Tomada breathed. &ldquo;Over at last,
the Light be praised.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; The soldier looked around, suddenly seeming
lost. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;suppose it is. I suppose&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He peered at his
hands, then let them fall to his sides again. He sounded weary.
&ldquo;The local folk could not wait to begin celebrating. If the news is
true, it might go on for days. I wonder if&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? No, they will
not want soldiers joining them. Will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For tonight, perhaps,&rdquo; Tomada said. &ldquo;But we have
three more towns to visit before our circuit is done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. You still have work to do. You have
that.&rdquo; The soldier looked around again. &ldquo;There are still Trollocs.
Even if the Forsaken are gone, there are still Trollocs. And
Nightriders.&rdquo; Nodding to himself, he started back toward the jo-cars.</p>

<p>Tomada did not appear excited at all, of course, but
Coumin felt as stunned as the young soldier. The war was over? What
would the world be like without war? Suddenly he had to talk to
Charn.</p>

<p>Sounds of merrymaking rolled out to meet him before
he reached the town&mdash;laughing, singing. The bells in the town
hall tower began ringing exuberantly. Townspeople danced in the
streets, men and women and children. Coumin dodged between them,
searching. Charn had elected to stay at one of the inns where the
Aiel were putting up instead of coming to the singing&mdash;even
the Aes Sedai could no longer do much for the aches in his aged
knees&mdash;but surely he would be out for this.</p>

<p>Abruptly something struck Coumin in the mouth and his
legs buckled; he was pushing himself to his knees before he
realized he was down. A hand put to his mouth came away bloody. He
looked up to find an angry faced townsman standing over him,
nursing a fist. &ldquo;Why did you do that?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>The townsman spat at him. &ldquo;The Forsaken are dead.
Dead, do you hear? Lanfear will not protect you anymore. We will
root out all of you who served the Forsaken while pretending to be
on our side, and treat the lot of you as we treated that crazy old
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A woman was tugging at the man&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Come away,
Toma. Come away, and hold your foolish tongue! Do you want the
Ogier to come for you?&rdquo; Suddenly wary, the man let her pull him
away into the crowd.</p>

<p>Struggling to his feet, Coumin began to run, heedless
of the blood oozing down his chin.</p>

<p>The inn was empty, silent. Not even the innkeeper was
there, or the cook, or her helpers. Coumin ran through the building
shouting, &ldquo;Charn? Charn? <em>Charn</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Out back, maybe. Charn liked to sit under the
spiceapple trees behind the inn, and tell his stories of the days
when he was young.</p>

<p>Coumin ran out the back door, and tripped, falling on
his face. It was an empty boot that had caught his toe. One of
Charn&rsquo;s red dress boots that he wore all the time, now that he no
longer joined in the singing. Something made Coumin look up.</p>

<p>Charn&rsquo;s white-haired body hung from a rope pulled
over the ridgepole, one foot bare where he had kicked his boot off,
the fingers of one hand caught at his neck where he had tried to
pull the rope free.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Coumin said. &ldquo;We are Da&rsquo;shain. Why?&rdquo; There was
no one to answer. Clutching the boot to his chest, he knelt there,
staring up at Charn, as the noise of revelry washed over him.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Rand quivered. The light from the columns was a
shimmering blue haze that seemed solid, that seemed to claw the
nerves out of his skin. The wind howled, one vast whirlwind sucking
inward. Muradin had managed to veil himself; bloody sockets stared
blindly above the black veil. The Aiel was chewing, and bloody
froth dripped onto his chest. Forward.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Charn made his way down the side of the wide, crowded
street beneath the spreading chora trees, their trefoil leaves
spreading peace and contentment in the shadows of silvery buildings
that touched the sky. A city without choras would seem bleak as
wilderness. Jo-cars hummed quietly down the street, and a great
white sho-wing darted across the sky, carrying citizens to Comelle
or Tzora or somewhere. He seldom used the sho-wings, himself&mdash;if he needed to go very far, an Aes Sedai usually Traveled with him&mdash;but tonight he would, to M&rsquo;jinn. Today was his twenty-fifth
naming day, and tonight he intended to accept Nalla&rsquo;s latest offer
of marriage. He wondered if she would be surprised; he had been
putting her off for a year, not wanting to settle down. It would
mean changing his service to Zorelle Sedai, whom Nalla served, but
Mierin Sedai had already given her blessing.</p>

<p>He rounded a corner and just had time to see a dark,
wide-shouldered man with a fashionably narrow beard before the
man&rsquo;s shoulder sent him crashing to his back, head bouncing on the
walkway so he saw spots. Dazed, he lay there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch where you are going,&rdquo; the bearded man said
irritably, adjusting his sleeveless red coat and flicking the lace
at his wrists. His black hair, hanging to his shoulders, was
gathered in back. That was the latest fashion, too, as near as
anyone who had not sworn to the Covenant would come to imitating
Aiel.</p>

<p>The pale-haired woman with him laid a hand on his
arm, her dress of shimmery white streith becoming more opaque with
her sudden embarrassment. &ldquo;Jom, look at his hair. He is Aiel,
Jom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Feeling his head to see if it was cracked, Charn&rsquo;s
fingers brushed through short-cut, reddish-gold hair. He gave the
longer tail at his nape a tug in lieu of shaking his head. A
bruise, he thought, but no more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So he is.&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s annoyance vanished in
consternation. &ldquo;Forgive me, Da&rsquo;shain. I am the one who should be
watching where he walks. Let me help you up.&rdquo; He was already
suiting his words, hoisting Charn to his feet. &ldquo;Are you all right?
Let me call a jumper to take you where you are going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not hurt, citizen,&rdquo; Charn said mildly. &ldquo;Truly,
it was my fault.&rdquo; It had been, hurrying like that. He could have
injured the man. &ldquo;Did I harm you? Please, forgive me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man opened his mouth to protest&mdash;citizens
always did; they seemed to think Aiel were made of spinglass&mdash;but before he could speak, the ground rippled under their feet. The
air rippled, too, in spreading waves. The man looked about
uncertainly, pulling his stylish fancloth cloak around himself and
his lady so their heads seemed to float disembodied. &ldquo;What is it,
Da&rsquo;shain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Others who had seen Charn&rsquo;s hair were gathering
around him anxiously asking the same questions, but he ignored
them, not even thinking of whether he was being rude. He actually
began to push through the crowd, his eyes fixed on the Sharom; the
white sphere, a thousand feet in diameter, floated as high above
the blue and silver domes of the Collam Daan.</p>

<p>Mierin had said today was the day. She said she had
found a new source for the One Power. Female Aes Sedai and male
would be able to tap the same source, not separate halves. What men
and women could do united would be even greater now that there
would be no differences. And today she and Beidomon would tap it
for the first time&mdash;the last time men and women would work
together wielding a different Power. Today.</p>

<p>What seemed a tiny chip of white spun away from the
Sharom in a jet of black fire; it descended, deceptively slow,
insignificant. Then a hundred gouts spurted everywhere around the
huge white sphere. The Sharom broke apart like an egg and began to
drift down, falling, an obsidian inferno. Darkness spread across
the sky, swallowing the sun in unnatural night, as if the light of
those flames was blackness. People were screaming, screaming
everywhere.</p>

<p>With the first spurt of fire, Charn broke into a run
toward the Collam Daan, but he knew he was too late. He was sworn
to serve Aes Sedai, and he was too late. Tears rolled down his face
as he ran.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Blinking to dispel the spots fluttering across his
vision, Rand squeezed his head with both hands. The image still
drifted through his head, that huge sphere, burning black, falling.
<em>Did I really see the hole being drilled into the Dark One&rsquo;s
prison? Did I?</em> He stood at the edge of the glass columns,
staring out at <em>Avendesora. A chora tree. A city is a wilderness
without chora. And now there&rsquo;s only one</em>. The columns sparkled
in the blue glow from the dome of fog above, but once again the
light seemed only brilliant reflections. There was no sign of
Muradin; he did not think the Aiel had come out of the glass
forest. Or ever would.</p>

<p>Suddenly something caught his eye, low in the
branches of the Tree of Life. A shape swinging slowly. A man,
hanging from a pole laid across two branches by a rope around his
neck.</p>

<p>With a wordless roar, he ran for the tree, grabbing
at <em>saidin</em>, the fiery sword coming into his hands as he leaped,
slashing at the rope. He and Mat hit the dusty white paving stones
with twin thuds. The pole jarred free and clattered down beside
them; not a pole, but an odd black-hafted spear with a short sword
blade in place of a spearpoint, slightly curved and single edged.
Rand would not have cared if it was made of gold and <em>
cuendillar</em> set with sapphires and firedrops.</p>

<p>Letting sword and Power go, he ripped the rope away
from Mat&rsquo;s neck and pressed an ear to his friend&rsquo;s chest. Nothing.
Desperately, he tore open Mat&rsquo;s coat and shirt, breaking the
leather cord that held a silver medallion on Mat&rsquo;s chest. He tossed
the medallion aside, listened again. Nothing. No heartbeat. Dead.
<em>No! He&rsquo;d be all right if I hadn&rsquo;t let him follow me here. I
can&rsquo;t let him be dead!</em></p>

<p>As hard as he could he pounded his fist against Mat&rsquo;s
chest, listened. Nothing. Again he hammered, listened. Yes. There.
A faint heartbeat. It was. So faint, so slow. And slowing. But Mat
was still alive despite the heavy purple welt around his neck. He
might yet be kept alive.</p>

<p>Filling his lungs, Rand scrambled around to breathe
into Mat&rsquo;s mouth as strongly as he could. Again. Again. Then he
leaped astride Mat, seized the waist of his breeches and heaved
upward, lifting his hips off the pavement. Up and down, three
times, and then back to breathing into his mouth. He could have
channeled; he might have been able to do something that way. The
memory of that girl in the Stone stopped him. He wanted Mat to
live. Live, not be a puppet moved by the Power. Once back in
Emond&rsquo;s Field he had seen Master Luhhan revive a boy who had been
found floating in the Winespring Water. So he breathed and heaved,
breathed and heaved and prayed.</p>

<p>Abruptly Mat jerked, coughed. Rand knelt beside him
as he put both hands to his throat and rolled onto his side,
sucking air in an agonized rattle.</p>

<p>Mat touched the piece of rope with one hand and
shivered. &ldquo;Those flaming&mdash;sons&mdash;of goats,&rdquo; he muttered
hoarsely. &ldquo;They tried&mdash;to kill me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who did?&rdquo; Rand asked, looking around warily.
Half-finished palaces around the great littered square stared back at
him. Surely Rhuidean was empty except for the two of them. Unless
Muradin was still alive, somewhere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The folk&mdash;on the other side&mdash;of that&mdash;twisted doorway.&rdquo; Swallowing painfully, Mat sat up and took
a deep unsteady breath. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one here, too, Rand.&rdquo; He still
sounded as if his throat had been rasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could go through it? Did they answer questions?&rdquo;
That could be useful. He desperately needed more answers. A
thousand questions, and too few answers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No answers,&rdquo; Mat said huskily. &ldquo;They cheat. And they
tried to kill me.&rdquo; He picked up the medallion, a silver foxhead
that almost filled his palm, and after a moment stuffed it into his
pocket with a grimace. &ldquo;I got something out of them, at least.&rdquo;
Pulling the strange spear to him, he ran his fingers along the
black shaft. A line of some strange cursive script ran its length,
bracketed by a pair of birds inlaid in metal even darker than the
wood. Ravens, Rand thought they were. Another pair were engraved on
the blade. With a rough wry laugh, Mat levered himself to his feet,
half-leaning on the spear, the sword blade beginning just level
with his head. He did not bother to lace up his shirt or button his
coat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep this, too. Their joke, but I will keep it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A joke?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat nodded. &ldquo;What it says&mdash;</p>

<p class="verse">&ldquo;Thus it our treaty written; thus is agreement made.<br>
Thought is the arrow of time; memory never fades.<br>
What was asked is given. The price is paid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pretty joke, you see. I&rsquo;ll slice them with their
own wit if I ever get the chance. I&rsquo;ll give them &lsquo;thought and
memory.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; He winced, scrubbing a hand through his hair. &ldquo;Light,
but my head hurts. It&rsquo;s spinning, like a thousand bits of dreams,
and every one a needle. Do you think Moiraine will do something for
it if I ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure she will,&rdquo; Rand replied slowly. Mat had to
be hurting badly if he sought the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s help. He looked at
the dark spear shaft again. Most of the script was hidden by Mat&rsquo;s
hand, but not all. Whatever it was, he had no idea what it said.
How had Mat? Rhuidean&rsquo;s empty windows stared at him mockingly. We
hide many secrets still, they seemed to say. More than you know.
Worse than you know. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back now, Mat. I don&rsquo;t care if we
have to cross the valley in the night. As you said, it will be
cooler. I don&rsquo;t want to stay in here any longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That sounds just fine to me,&rdquo; Mat said, coughing.
&ldquo;As long as we can get another drink of water at that
fountain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand kept his pace to Mat&rsquo;s, which was slow at first,
hobbling along using the odd spear as a walking staff. He paused
once to look at the two figurines of a man and a woman holding
crystal spheres, but he left them there. Not yet. Not for a long
time yet, if he was lucky.</p>

<p>When they left the square behind, the unfinished
palaces rearing along the street had a threatening look, their
jagged tops like the walls of great fortresses. Rand embraced <em>
saidin</em>, though he saw no real threat. But he felt it, as
though murderous eyes were boring into his back. Rhuidean lay
peaceful and empty, shadowless in the blue glow of its fog roof.
The dust in the streets rippled in the wind&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The wind. There
was no wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, burn me,&rdquo; Mat muttered. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re in
trouble, Rand. It&rsquo;s what I get for staying around you. You always
get me in trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ripples came faster, sliding together to make
thicker lines, quivering still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you walk faster?&rdquo; Rand asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walk? Blood and ashes, I can run.&rdquo; Slanting the
spear across his chest, Mat suited his words with a lurching
gallop.</p>

<p>Running alongside, Rand brought his sword back,
uncertain of what he could do with it against shivering lines of
dust, uncertain that there really was need. It was only dust. <em>
No, it bloody isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s one of those bubbles. The Dark One&rsquo;s
evil, drifting along the Pattern, seeking out bloody</em> ta&rsquo;veren.<em> I
know it is</em>.</p>

<p>All around them dust rippled and shivered ever
thicker, bunching and gathering. Suddenly, right in front of them,
a shape reared up in the basin of a dry fountain, a solid man
shape, dark and featureless, with fingers like sharp claws.
Silently it leaped at them.</p>

<p>Rand moved instinctively&mdash;the Moon Rises Over
Water&mdash;and the blade of Power sliced through that dark
figure. In a twinkling it was only a thick cloud of dust, drifting
toward the pavement.</p>

<p>Others replaced it, though, black faceless shapes
rushing in from all sides, no two alike, but all with reaching
claws. Rand danced the forms among them, blade weaving intricate
patterns in the air, leaving floating motes behind. Mat used his
spear like a quarterstaff, a spinning blur, but bringing the sword
blade into it as if he had always used the weapon. The creatures
died or at least returned to dust but they were many, and quick.
Blood poured down Rand&rsquo;s face, and the old wound in his side burned
on the point of splitting open. Red spread across Mat&rsquo;s face, too,
and down his chest. Too many, and too quick.</p>

<p><em>You do not do the tenth part of what you are
capable of already</em>. That was what Lanfear had told him. He
laughed as he danced the forms. Learn from one of the Forsaken. He
could do that, if not the way she intended. Yes, he could. He
channeled, wove strands of the Power, and sent a whirlwind into the
middle of each black shape. They exploded in clouds of dust that
left him coughing. As far as he could see, dust settled from the
air.</p>

<p>Hacking and panting, Mat leaned on his dark shafted
spear. &ldquo;Did you do that?&rdquo; he wheezed, wiping blood away from his
eyes. &ldquo;About time. If you knew how, why didn&rsquo;t you bloody do it in
the first place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand started to laugh again&mdash;<em>Because I
didn&rsquo;t think of it. Because I</em> didn&rsquo;t <em>know how until I did
it</em>&mdash;but it froze in his mouth. Dust drifted out of the
air, and as it settled on the ground, it began to ripple. &ldquo;Run,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;We have to get out of here. Run!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Side by side they sped for the fog, slashing at any
lines of dust that seemed to be thickening, kicking at them,
anything to keep them from coalescing. Rand sent whirlwinds
swirling wildly in every direction. Dispelled dust began shivering
back together immediately, even before it reached the ground now.
They kept running, into the fog and through, bursting out into dim,
sharp-shadowed light.</p>

<p>Side aching, Rand spun, ready to try lightning, or
fire, anything. Nothing came through the fog after them. Maybe the
mist was a wall to those dark shapes. Maybe it held them in. Maybe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He did not know. He did not really care, so long as the
things could not follow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn me,&rdquo; Mat muttered hoarsely, &ldquo;we were in there
all night. It&rsquo;s nearly sunrise. I didn&rsquo;t think it was that
long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stared at the sky. The sun had not topped the
mountains yet; a painfully brilliant nimbus outlined the jagged
peaks. Long shadows covered the valley floor. <em>He will come from
Rhuidean at dawn, and tie you together with bonds you cannot break.
He will take you back, and he will destroy you</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back up the mountain,&rdquo; he said quietly.
&ldquo;They will be waiting for us.&rdquo; <em>For me</em>.</p>
