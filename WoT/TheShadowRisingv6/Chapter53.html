<h4><em>The Price of a Departure</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">O</span>nly
three candles and two lamps lit the common room
of the Winespring Inn, since candles and oil both were in short
supply. The spears and other weapons were gone from the walls; the
barrel that had held old swords was empty. The lamps stood on two
of the tables pushed together in front of the tall stone fireplace,
where Marin al&rsquo;Vere and Daise Congar and others of the Women&rsquo;s
Circle were going over lists of the scanty food remaining in
Emond&rsquo;s Field. Perrin tried not to listen.</p>

<p>At another table Faile&rsquo;s honing stone made a soft,
steady <em>whisk-whisk</em> as she sharpened one of her knives. A
bow lay in front of her, and a bristling quiver hung at her belt.
She had turned out to be a fairly good shot, but he hoped she never
discovered that it was a boy&rsquo;s bow; she could not draw a man&rsquo;s Two
Rivers longbow, though she refused to admit it.</p>

<p>Shifting his axe so it would not dig into his side,
he tried to put his mind back on what he was discussing with the
men around the table with him. Not that all of them were keeping
their own attention where it should be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have lamps,&rdquo; Cenn muttered, &ldquo;and we make do
with tallow.&rdquo; The gnarled old man glared at the pair of candles in
brass candlesticks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give over, Cenn,&rdquo; Tam said wearily, pulling pipe and
tabac pouch from behind his sword belt. &ldquo;For once, give over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we had to read or write,&rdquo; Abell said, his voice
less patient than the words, &ldquo;we&rsquo;d have lamps.&rdquo; A bandage was wound
around his temples.</p>

<p>As if to remind the thatcher that he was Mayor, Bran
adjusted the silver medallion hanging on his wide chest, showing a
pair of scales. &ldquo;Keep your mind to the business at hand, Cenn. I&rsquo;ll
have none of your wasting Perrin&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just think we should have lamps,&rdquo; Cenn complained.
&ldquo;Perrin would tell me if I was wasting his time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin sighed; the night tried to drag his eyelids
down. He wished it were someone else&rsquo;s turn to represent the
Village Council, Haral Luhhan or Jon Thane or Samel Crawe, or
anybody but Cenn with his carping. But then, sometimes he wished
one of these men would turn to him and say, &ldquo;<em>This is business
for the Mayor and the Council, young fellow. You go on back to the
forge. We&rsquo;ll let you know what to do.</em>&rdquo; Instead they worried
about wasting his time, deferred to him. Time. How many attacks had
there been in the seven days since the first? He was not sure any
longer.</p>

<p>The bandage on Abell&rsquo;s head irritated Perrin. The Aes
Sedai only Healed the most serious wounds now; if a man could
manage without, they let him. It was not that there were many badly
wounded yet, but as Verin pointed out wryly, even as Aes Sedai only
had so much strength; apparently their trick with the catapult
stones took as much as Healing. For once he did not want to be
reminded of limits to Aes Sedai strength. Not many badly wounded.
Yet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are the arrows holding out?&rdquo; he asked. That was
what he was supposed to be thinking about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well enough,&rdquo; Tam said, puffing his pipe alight from
one of the candles. &ldquo;We still recover most of what we shoot, in
daylight at least. They drag a lot of their dead away at night&mdash;fodder for the cookpots, I suppose&mdash;and we lose
those.&rdquo; The other men were digging out their pipes, too, from
pouches and coat pockets, Cenn muttering that he seemed to have
forgotten his pouch. Grumbling, Bran passed his across, his bald
pate gleaming in the candlelight.</p>

<p>Perrin rubbed at his forehead. What had he meant to
ask next? The stakes. There was fighting at the stakes in most
attacks now, especially at night. How many times had the Trollocs
nearly broken through? Three? Four? &ldquo;Does everyone have a spear or
some sort of polearm now? What&rsquo;s left to make more?&rdquo; Silence
answered him, and he lowered his hand. The other men were staring
at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You asked that yesterday,&rdquo; Abell said gently. &ldquo;And
Haral told you then there isn&rsquo;t a scythe or pitchfork left in the
village that hasn&rsquo;t been made into a weapon. We&rsquo;ve more than we
have hands for, in truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Of course. It just slipped my mind.&rdquo; A snatch
of conversation from the Women&rsquo;s Circle caught his ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;mustn&rsquo;t let the men know,&rdquo; Marin was saying
softly, as if repeating a caution voiced before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; Daise snorted, but not much louder.
&ldquo;If the fools find out the women are on half rations, they&rsquo;ll
insist on eating the same, and we can&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin closed his eyes, tried to close his ears. Of
course. The men did the fighting. The men had to keep their
strength up. Simple. At least none of the women had had to fight
yet. Except the two Aiel women, of course, and Faile, but she was
smart enough to stay back when it came to pushing spears among the
stakes. That was the reason he had found the bow for her. She had
the heart of a leopard, and more courage than any two men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it is time you went to bed, Perrin,&rdquo; Bran
suggested. &ldquo;You cannot go on like this, sleeping an hour here and
an hour there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scrubbing his beard vigorously, Perrin tried to look
alert. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sleep later.&rdquo; When it was over. &ldquo;Are the men getting
enough sleep? I&rsquo;ve seen some sitting up when they should be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The front door banged open to admit skinny Dannil
Lewin out of the night, bow in hand and all in a lather. He wore
one of the swords from the barrel on his hip; Tam had been giving
classes when he had the time, and sometimes one of the Warders did
as well.</p>

<p>Before Dannil could open his mouth, Daise snapped,
&ldquo;Were you raised in a barn, Dannil Lewin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can certainly treat my door a little more
gently.&rdquo; Marin divided her meaning look between the lanky man and
Daise, a reminder that it <em>was</em> her door.</p>

<p>Dannil ducked his head, clearing his throat. &ldquo;Pardon,
Mistress al&rsquo;Vere,&rdquo; he said hastily. &ldquo;Pardon, Wisdom. Sorry to burst
in, but I&rsquo;ve a message for Perrin.&rdquo; He hurried to the table of men
as if afraid the women would stop him again. &ldquo;The Whitecloaks
brought in a man who wants to talk to you, Perrin. He won&rsquo;t talk to
anybody else. He&rsquo;s hurt bad, Perrin. They only brought him to the
edge of the village. I don&rsquo;t think he could make it as far as the
inn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin pushed himself to his feet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming.&rdquo; Not
another attack, at any rate. They were worst at night.</p>

<p>Faile snatched up her bow and joined him before he
reached the door. And Aram stood up, hesitating, from the shadows
on the foot of the stairs. Sometimes Perrin forgot the man was
there, he kept so still. He looked odd with that sword strapped on
his back atop his grimy, yellow-striped Tinker coat, his eyes so
bright, hardly ever seeming to blink; and his face without
expression. Neither Raen or Ila had spoken to their grandson since
the day he picked up that sword. Nor to Perrin, either.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re coming, come,&rdquo; he said gruffly, and Aram
fell in at his heels. The man followed him like a hound whenever he
was not pestering Tam or Ihvon or Tomas to teach him that sword. It
was as if he had replaced his family and people with Perrin. Perrin
would have done without the responsibility if he could, but there
it was.</p>

<p>Moonlight shone down on thatched roofs. Few houses
had a light in more than one window. Stillness clung to the
village. Some thirty of the Companions stood guard outside the inn
with their bows, as many wearing swords as could find them;
everyone had adopted that name, and Perrin found himself using it,
too, to his private disgust. The reason for guards on the inn, or
wherever Perrin was, lay on the Green, no longer so crowded with
sheep and cows. Campfires crowded above the Winespring, beyond
where that fool wolfhead banner hung limp now, bright pools in the
darkness surrounded by pale cloaks gleaming with the moon.</p>

<p>No one had wanted Whitecloaks in their homes, already
crowded, and Bornhald did not want his soldiers split up in any
case. The man seemed to think the village would turn on him and his
men any moment; if they followed Perrin, they must be Darkfriends.
Even Perrin&rsquo;s eyes could not make out faces around the fires, but
he thought he could feel Bornhald&rsquo;s stare, waiting, hating.</p>

<p>Dannil readied ten Companions to escort Perrin, all
young men who should have been laughing and carousing with him, all
with bows ready to see him safe. Aram did not join them as Dannil
led the way down the dark, dirt street; it was Perrin he was with
and no one else. Faile kept hard by Perrin&rsquo;s side, dark eyes
shining in the moonlight, scanning the surroundings as though <em>
she</em> were his whole protection.</p>

<p>Where the Old Road entered Emond&rsquo;s Field the blocking
wagons had been drawn aside to admit the Whitecloak patrol, twenty
snowy-cloaked men with lances who sat their horses in burnished
armor, no less impatient than their stamping mounts. They stood out
in the night for any eye, and most Trollocs could see as well in
darkness as Perrin, but the Whitecloaks insisted on their patrols.
Sometimes their scouting had brought warnings, and maybe their
harassment kept the Trollocs a little off balance. It would have
been good, though, if he had known what they were doing before it
was done.</p>

<p>A cluster of villagers and farmers wearing bits of
old armor and a few rusty helmets stood clustered around a man in a
farmer&rsquo;s coat lying in the roadway. They gave way for Faile and
him, and he went to one knee beside the mart.</p>

<p>The odor of blood was strong; sweat glistened on the
man&rsquo;s moon-shadowed face. A thumb-thick Trolloc arrow like a small
spear was stuck through his chest. &ldquo;Perrin&mdash;Goldeneyes,&rdquo; he
muttered hoarsely, laboring for breath. &ldquo;Must&mdash;get through&mdash;to Perrin&mdash;Goldeneyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has someone sent for one of the Aes Sedai?&rdquo; Perrin
demanded, lifting the man as gently as he could, cradling his head.
He did not listen for the answer; he did not think this man would
last till an Aes Sedai came. &ldquo;I am Perrin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goldeneyes? I&mdash;cannot see&mdash;very well.&rdquo;
His wide, wild stare was right at Perrin&rsquo;s face; if he could see at
all, the fellow must see his eyes shining golden in the dark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Perrin Goldeneyes,&rdquo; he said reluctantly.</p>

<p>The man seized his collar, pulling his face close
with surprising strength. &ldquo;We are&mdash;coming. Sent to&mdash;tell you. We are co&mdash;&rdquo; His head fell back, eyes staring at
nothing now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light be with his soul,&rdquo; Faile murmured,
slinging her bow across her back.</p>

<p>After a moment Perrin pried the man&rsquo;s fingers loose.
&ldquo;Does anyone know him?&rdquo; The Two Rivers men exchanged glances, shook
their heads. Perrin looked up at the mounted Whitecloaks. &ldquo;Did he
say anything else while you were bringing him in? Where did you
find him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jaret Byar stared down at him, gaunt-faced and
hollow-eyed, an image of death. The other Whitecloaks looked away,
but Byar always made himself meet Perrin&rsquo;s yellow eyes, especially
at night, when they glowed. Byar growled under his breath&mdash;Perrin heard &ldquo;Shadowspawn!&rdquo;&mdash;and booted his horse in the
ribs. The patrol galloped into the village, as eager to be away
from Perrin as from Trollocs. Aram stared after them,
expressionless, one hand over his shoulder to finger his sword
hilt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They said they found him three or four miles south.&rdquo;
Dannil hesitated, then added, &ldquo;They say the Trollocs are all
scattered out in little bunches, Perrin. Maybe they&rsquo;re finally
giving up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin laid the stranger back down. <em>We are
coming</em>. &ldquo;Keep a close watch. Maybe some family who tried to
hold on to their farm is finally coming in.&rdquo; He did not believe
anyone could have survived out there this long, but it might be so.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot anybody by mistake.&rdquo; He staggered to his feet, and
Faile put a hand on his arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is time you were in bed, Perrin. You have to
sleep sometime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He only looked at her. He should have made her stay
in Tear. Somehow, he should have made her. If he had only thought
well enough he could have.</p>

<p>One of the runners, a curly-haired boy about
chest-high, slipped through the Two Rivers men to tug at Perrin&rsquo;s
sleeve. Perrin did not know him; there were many families in from
the countryside. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something moving in the Westwood, Lord
Perrin. They sent me to tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me that,&rdquo; Perrin told him sharply. If he
did not stop the children, the Companions were going to start using
it, too. &ldquo;Go tell them I will be there.&rdquo; The boy darted away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You belong in your bed,&rdquo; Faile said firmly. &ldquo;Tomas
can handle any attack very well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t an attack, or the boy would have said so,
and somebody would be sounding Cenn&rsquo;s bugle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hung on to his arm, trying to pull him toward the
inn, and so she was dragged along when he started the opposite way.
After a few futile minutes she gave up and pretended she had been
merely holding his arm all along. But she muttered to herself. She
still seemed to think that if she spoke softly enough he could not
hear. She began with &ldquo;foolish,&rdquo; &ldquo;mule-headed,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;muscle-brained&rdquo;; after that it escalated. It was quite a little
procession, her muttering at him, Aram heeling him, Dannil and the
ten Companions surrounding him like a guard of honor. If he had not
been so tired, he would have felt a proper fool.</p>

<p>There were guards spaced in small clusters all along
the sharp stake fence to watch the night, each with a boy for a
runner. At the west end of the village the men on guard were all
gathered up against the inside of the broad barrier, fingering
spears and bows as they peered toward the Westwood. Even with the
moonlight, the trees had to be blackness in their eyes.</p>

<p>Tomas&rsquo;s cloak seemed to make parts of him vanish in
the night. Bain and Chiad were with him; for some reason the two
Maidens had spent every night at this end of Emond&rsquo;s Field since
Loial and Gaul left. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d not have bothered you,&rdquo; the Warder said
to Perrin, &ldquo;but there only seems to be one out there, and I thought
you might be able to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin nodded. Everyone knew about his vision,
especially in darkness. The Two Rivers people seemed to think it
something special, something that marked him out an idiot hero.
What the Warders thought, or the Aes Sedai, he had no idea. He was
too tired to care tonight. Seven days, and how many attacks?</p>

<p>The edge of the Westwood lay five hundred paces away.
Even to his eyes the trees ran together in shadows. Something
moved. Something big enough to be a Trolloc. A big shape carrying&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The burden lifted an arm. A human. A tall shadow carrying a
human.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will not shoot!&rdquo; he shouted. He wanted to laugh;
in fact, he realized he was laughing. &ldquo;Come on! Come on,
Loial!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dim shape lumbered forward faster than a man
could run, resolving into the Ogier, speeding toward the village,
carrying Gaul.</p>

<p>Two Rivers men shouted encouragement as if it were a
race. &ldquo;Run, Ogier! Run! Run!&rdquo; Perhaps it was a race; more than one
assault had come out of those woods.</p>

<p>Short of the stakes Loial slowed with a lurch; there
was barely room for his thick legs to edge through the barrier
sideways. Once on the village side, he let the Aielman down and
sank to the ground, leaning back against the hedge, panting, tufted
ears drooping wearily. Gaul limped on one leg until he could sit,
too, with Bain and Chiad both fussing over his left thigh, where
his breeches were ripped and black with dry blood. He only had two
spears left, and his quiver gaped emptily. Loial&rsquo;s axe was gone,
too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You fool Ogier,&rdquo; Perrin laughed fondly. &ldquo;Going off
like that. I ought to let Daise Congar switch you for a runaway. At
least you&rsquo;re alive. At least you&rsquo;re back.&rdquo; His voice sank at that.
Alive. And back in Emond&rsquo;s Field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We did it, Perrin,&rdquo; Loial panted, a tired drumlike
boom. &ldquo;Four days ago. We closed the Waygate. It will take the
Elders or an Aes Sedai to open it again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He carried me most of the way from the mountains,&rdquo;
Gaul said. &ldquo;A Nightrunner and perhaps fifty Trollocs chased us the
first three days, but Loial outran them.&rdquo; He was trying to push the
Maidens away without much success.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lie still, Shaarad,&rdquo; Chiad snapped, &ldquo;or I will say I
have touched you armed and allow you to choose how your honor
stands.&rdquo; Faile gave a delighted laugh. Perrin did not understand,
but the remark reduced the imperturbable Aielman to splutters. He
let the Maidens tend his leg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you all right, Loial?&rdquo; Perrin asked. &ldquo;Are you
hurt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Ogier pulled himself up with an obvious effort,
swaying for a moment like a tree about to fall. His ears still hung
limp. &ldquo;No, I am not hurt, Perrin. Only tired. Do not worry yourself
about me. A long time out of the <em>stedding</em>. Visits are not
enough.&rdquo; He shook his head as if his thoughts had wandered. His
wide hand engulfed Perrin&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;I will be fine after a
little sleep.&rdquo; He lowered his voice. For an Ogier, he did; it was
still a huge bumblebee rumble. &ldquo;It is very bad out there, Perrin.
We followed the last bands down, for the most part. We locked the
gate, but I think there must be several thousand Trollocs in the
Two Rivers already, and maybe as many as fifty Myrddraal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; Luc announced loudly. He had galloped up
along the edge of the houses from the direction of the North Road.
He reined his rearing black stallion to a flashy halt, forehooves
pawing. &ldquo;You are no doubt fine at singing to trees, Ogier, but
fighting Trollocs is something different. I estimate less than a
thousand now. A formidable force to be sure, but nothing these
stout defenses and brave men cannot hold at bay. Another trophy for
you, Lord Perrin Goldeneyes.&rdquo; Laughing, he tossed a bulging cloth
bag at Perrin. The bottom gleamed darkly wet in the moonlight.</p>

<p>Perrin caught it out of the air and hurled it well
over the stakes despite its weight. Four or five Trolloc heads, no
doubt, and perhaps a Myrddraal. The man brought in his trophies
every night, still seeming to expect them to be put up for everyone
to admire. A bunch of the Coplins and Congars had given him a feast
the night he came in with a pair of Fades&rsquo; heads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I also know nothing of fighting?&rdquo; Gaul demanded,
struggling to his feet. &ldquo;<em>I</em> say there are several
thousand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Luc&rsquo;s teeth showed white in a smile. &ldquo;How many days
have you spent in the Blight, Aiel? I have spent many.&rdquo; Perhaps it
was more snarl than smile. &ldquo;Many. Believe what you wish,
Goldeneyes. The endless days will bring what they bring, as they
always have.&rdquo; He pulled the stallion up on its hind legs again to
whirl about, and galloped in among the houses and the trees that
had once been the rim of the Westwood. The Two Rivers men shifted
uneasily, peering after him or out into the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is wrong,&rdquo; Loial said. &ldquo;Gaul and I saw what we
saw.&rdquo; His face sagged wearily, broad mouth turned down and long
eyebrows drooping on his cheeks. No wonder, if he had carried Gaul
for three or four days.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have done a lot, Loial,&rdquo; Perrin said, &ldquo;you and
Gaul both. A great thing. I am afraid your bedroom has half a dozen
Tinkers in it now, but Mistress al&rsquo;Vere will make you up a pallet.
It is time for you to get some of that sleep you want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And time for you as well, Perrin Aybara.&rdquo; Scudding
clouds made moonshadows play across Faile&rsquo;s bold nose and high
cheekbones. She was so beautiful. But her voice was firm enough for
a wagon bed. &ldquo;If you do not go now, I will have Loial carry you.
You can hardly stand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gaul was having trouble walking with his wounded leg.
Bain supported him from one side. He tried to stop Chiad from
taking the other, but she murmured something that sounded like
&ldquo;<em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>&rdquo; in a threatening way, and Bain laughed, and
the Aielman allowed them both to help him, growling furiously to
himself. Whatever the Maidens were going on about, it did have Gaul
in a taking.</p>

<p>Tomas clapped Perrin on the shoulder. &ldquo;Go, man.
Everyone needs to sleep.&rdquo; He himself sounded good for three more
days without it.</p>

<p>Perrin nodded.</p>

<p>He let Faile guide him back to the Winespring Inn
with Loial and the Aiel following, and Aram, and Dannil and the ten
Companions encircling him. He was not sure when the others fell
away, but somehow he and Faile were alone in his room on the second
floor of the inn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whole families are making do with no more space than
this,&rdquo; he muttered. A candle burned on the stone mantel over the
small fireplace. Others did without, but Marin lit one here as soon
as it turned dark so he would not have to be bothered. &ldquo;I can sleep
outside with Dannil and Ban and the others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not be an idiot,&rdquo; Faile said, making it sound
affectionate. &ldquo;If Alanna and Verin each has her own room, you
should, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He realized she had his coat off and was untying the
laces of his shirt. &ldquo;I am not too tired to undress myself.&rdquo; He
pushed her gently outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You take everything off,&rdquo; she ordered. &ldquo;Everything,
do you hear? You cannot sleep properly fully dressed, the way you
seem to think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; he promised. When he had the door closed,
he did tug off his boots before blowing out the candle and lying
down. Marin would not like dirty boots on her coverlet.</p>

<p>Thousands, Gaul and Loial said. Yet how much could
the two of them have seen, hiding on the way into the mountains,
fleeing on the way back? Maybe one thousand at most, Luc claimed,
but Perrin could not make himself trust the man for all the
trophies he brought in. Scattered, according to the Whitecloaks.
How close could they have come, armor and cloaks shining in the
darkness like lanterns?</p>

<p>There was a way to see for himself, perhaps. He had
avoided the wolf dream since his last visit; the desire to hunt
down this Slayer rose up whenever he thought of going back, and his
responsibilities lay here in Emond&rsquo;s Field. But now, perhaps&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Sleep rolled in while he was still considering.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">He stood on the Green bathed by an afternoon sun low
in the sky, a few white clouds drifting. There were no sheep or
cattle around the tall pole where a breeze ruffled the red wolfhead
banner, though a bluefly buzzed past his face. No people among the
thatched houses. Small piles of dry wood atop ashes marked the
Whitecloaks&rsquo; fires; he had rarely seen anything burning in the wolf
dream, only what was ready to burn or already charred. No ravens in
the sky.</p>

<p>As he scanned for the birds, a patch of sky darkened,
became a window to somewhere else. Egwene stood among a crowd of
women, fear in her eyes; slowly the women knelt around her. Nynaeve
was one of them, and he believed he saw Elayne&rsquo;s red-gold hair.
That window faded and was replaced. Mat stood naked and bound,
snarling; an odd spear with a black shaft had been thrust across
his back behind his elbows, and a silver medallion, a foxhead, hung
on his chest. Mat vanished, and it was Rand. Perrin thought it was
Rand. He wore rags and a rough cloak, and a bandage covered his
eyes. The third window disappeared; the sky was only sky, empty
except for the clouds.</p>

<p>Perrin shivered. These wolf-dream visions never
seemed to have any real connection to anything he knew. Maybe here,
where things could change so easily, worry over his friends became
something he could see. Whatever they were, he was wasting time
fretting at them.</p>

<p>He was not surprised to find he wore a blacksmith&rsquo;s
long leather vest and no shirt, but when he put a hand to his belt,
he found the hammer, not his axe. Frowning, he concentrated on the
long half-moon blade and thick spike. That was what he needed now.
That was what he was now. The hammer changed slowly, as if
resisting, but when the axe finally hung in the thick loop, it kept
shining dangerously. Why did it fight him so? He knew what he
wanted. A filled quiver appeared on his other hip, a longbow in his
hand, a leather bracer on his left forearm.</p>

<p>Three land-blurring strides took him where the
nearest Trolloc camps supposedly lay, three miles from the village.
The last step landed him among nearly a dozen tall heaps of wood
laid on old ashes amid trampled-down barley, the logs mixed with
broken chairs and table legs and even a farmhouse door. Great black
iron cauldrons stood ready to be hung over the laid cook fires.
Empty cauldrons, of course, though he knew what would be cut up
into them, what would be spitted on the thick iron rods stretched
over some of the fires. How many Trollocs would these fires serve?
There were no tents, and the blankets scattered about, filthy and
stinking of old acrid Trolloc sweat, were no real guide; many
Trollocs slept like animals, uncovered on the ground, even
hollowing out a hole to lie in.</p>

<p>In smaller steps that covered no more than a hundred
paces each, the land seeming only to haze, he circled Emond&rsquo;s
Field, from farm to farm, pasture to barley field to rows of tabac,
through scattered copses of trees, along cart tracks and footpaths,
finding more and more clusters of waiting Trolloc fires as he
slowly spiraled outward. Too many. Hundreds of fires. That had to
mean several thousand Trollocs. Five thousand or ten or twice that&mdash;it would make little difference to Emond&rsquo;s Field if they all
came at once.</p>

<p>Farther south the signs of Trollocs vanished. Signs
of their immediate presence, at least. Few farmhouses or barns
stood unburned. Scattered fields of charred stubble remained where
barley or tabac had been torched; others had great swathes trampled
through the crops. No reason for it but the joy of destruction; the
people had been long gone when most of it was done. Once he lighted
in the midst of large patches of ash, some charred wagon wheels
still showing hints of bright color here and there. The site of the
Tuatha&rsquo;an caravan&rsquo;s destruction pained him even more than the
farmhouses. The Way of the Leaf should have a chance. Somewhere.
Not here. Not letting himself look, he leaped south a mile or
more.</p>

<p>Eventually he came to Deven Ride, rows of
thatch-roofed houses surrounding a green and a pond fed by a spring
walled &rsquo;round with stone, the spillover splashing from cuts long
since worn deeper than they had been made. The inn at the head of
the green, the Goose and Pipe, was roofed with thatch, too, yet a
little larger than the Winespring Inn, though Deven Ride surely had
even fewer visitors than Emond&rsquo;s Field. The village was certainly
no bigger. Wagons and carts drawn close by every house spoke of
farmers who had fled here with their families. Other wagons blocked
the streets and the spaces between the houses all the way around
the edge of the village. The precautions were not enough to have
halted even one of the assaults made on Emond&rsquo;s Field the last
seven days.</p>

<p>In three circuits around the village Perrin found
only half a dozen Trolloc camps. Enough to keep people in. Pen them
until Emond&rsquo;s Field was dealt with. Then the Trollocs could fall on
Deven Ride at the Fades&rsquo; leisure. Perhaps he could find a way to
get word to these villagers. If they fled south, they might find
some way across the White River. Even trying to cross the trackless
Forest of Shadows below the river was better than waiting to die&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The golden sun had not moved an inch. Time was
different, here.</p>

<p>Running north as hard as he could, even Emond&rsquo;s Field
passed by in a blur. Watch Hill on its round prominence was
bordered as Deven Ride had been with wagons and carts between the
houses. A banner waved lazily in the breeze, on a tall pole in
front of the White Boar on the hill&rsquo;s crest. A red eagle flying
across a field of blue. The Red Eagle had been the symbol of
Manetheren. Perhaps Alanna or Verin had told ancient stories while
they were in Watch Hill.</p>

<p>Here, too, he found only a few Trolloc camps, enough
to pen the villagers. There was an easier way out from here than
trying to cross the White, with its endless stretch of rapids.</p>

<p>On northward he ran, to Taren Ferry, on the bank of
the Tarendrelle, which he had grown up calling the River Taren.
Tall, narrow houses built on high stone foundations to escape the
Taren&rsquo;s yearly flooding when the snows melted in the Mountains of
Mist. Nearly half those foundations supported only piles of ash and
charred beams in that unchanging afternoon light. There were no
wagons here, no signs of any defense. And no Trolloc camps that he
could find. Perhaps no people remained here.</p>

<p>At the water&rsquo;s edge stood a stout wooden dock, a
heavy rope drooping as it arced across the swift-flowing river. The
rope ran through iron rings on a flat-decked barge snugged against
the dock. The ferry was still there, still usable.</p>

<p>A jump took him across the river, where wheel ruts
scarred the bank and household objects lay about. Chairs and
stand-mirrors, chests, even a few tables and a polished wardrobe
with birds carved on the doors, all the things panicked people had
tried to save, then abandoned to run faster. They would be
spreading the word of what had happened here, what was happening in
the Two Rivers. Some could have reached Baerlon by now, a hundred
miles or more north, and surely the farms and villages between
Baerlon and the river. Word spreading. In another month it might
reach Caemlyn, and Queen Morgase with her Queen&rsquo;s Guards and her
power to raise armies. A month with luck. And as much to return,
once Morgase believed. Too late for Emond&rsquo;s Field. Maybe too late
for the whole Two Rivers.</p>

<p>Still, it hardly made sense that the Trollocs had let
anyone escape. Or the Myrddraal at any rate; Trollocs did not seem
to think much beyond the moment. He would have thought destroying
the ferry would have been the Fades&rsquo; first task. How could they be
sure there were not enough soldiers at Baerlon to come down on
them?</p>

<p>He bent to pick up a doll with a painted wooden face,
and an arrow streaked through where his chest had been.</p>

<p>Springing out of his crouch he leaped up the bank, a
blur streaking a hundred paces into the woods to crouch below a
tall leatherleaf. Brush and flood-toppled trees woven with creepers
covered the forest floor around him.</p>

<p>Slayer. Perrin had an arrow nocked, and wondered if
he had drawn it from his quiver or simply thought it there.
Slayer.</p>

<p>On the point of leaping away again, he paused. Slayer
would know roughly where he was. Perrin had followed the man&rsquo;s
blurring form easily enough; that elongated streak was clear if you
were standing still. Twice now he had played the other&rsquo;s game and
nearly lost. Let Slayer play his this time. He waited.</p>

<p>Ravens swooped above the treetops, searching and
calling. No movement to give him away; not a twitch. Only his eyes
moved, studying the forest around him. A vagrant puff of air
brought him a cold smell, human yet not, and he smiled. No sound
save the ravens, though; this Slayer stalked well. But he was not
used to being hunted. What else did Slayer forget beside smells? He
surely would not expect Perrin to remain where he had landed.
Animals ran from the hunter; even wolves ran.</p>

<p>A hint of movement, and for an instant a face
appeared above a fallen pine some fifty paces away. The slanting
light illuminated it clearly. Dark hair and blue eyes, a face all
hard planes and angles, so reminiscent of Lan&rsquo;s face. Except that
in that brief glimpse Slayer licked his lips twice; his forehead
was creased, and his eyes darted as they searched. Lan would not
have let his worry show if he stood alone against a thousand
Trollocs. Just an instant, and the face was gone again. The ravens
darted and swirled above as if they shared Slayer&rsquo;s anxiety,
fearing to come below the treetops.</p>

<p>Perrin waited and watched, motionless. Silence. Only
the cold smell to say he was not alone with the ravens
overhead.</p>

<p>Slayer&rsquo;s face appeared again, peering around a
thick-boled oak off to his left. Thirty paces. Oaks killed most of
what grew close to them; only a few mushrooms and weedy things
sprouted from the leafy mulch beneath its limbs. Slowly the man
emerged into the open, boots making no sound.</p>

<p>In one motion Perrin drew and fired. The ravens
screamed warning, and Slayer spun to take the broadhead shaft in
his chest, but not through the heart. The man howled, clutching the
arrow with both hands; black feathers rained down as the ravens
beat their wings in a frenzy. And Slayer faded, him and his cry
together, growing misty, transparent, vanishing. The ravens&rsquo;
shrieks vanished as if severed with a knife; the arrow that had
transfixed the man dropped to the ground. The ravens were gone,
too.</p>

<p>With a second shaft half-drawn, Perrin exhaled
slowly, let off his tension on the bowstring. Was that how you died
here? Simply fading away, gone forever?</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least I finished him,&rdquo; he muttered. And let
himself be diverted in the process. Slayer was no part of why he
had come to the wolf dream. At least the wolves were safe now. The
wolves&mdash;and maybe a few others.</p>

<p>He stepped out of the dream&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and woke staring at the ceiling, his shirt
clinging sweatily. The moon gave a little light through the
windows. There were fiddles playing somewhere in the village, a
wild Tinker tune. They would not fight, but they had found a way to
help, by keeping spirits up.</p>

<p>Slowly Perrin sat up, pulling on his boots in the
pale-lit dark. How to do what he had to do? It would be difficult.
He had to be cunning. Only, he was not sure he had ever been
cunning in his life. Standing, he stamped his feet to settle them
in.</p>

<p>Sudden shouts outside and a fading clatter of hooves
made him stride to the nearest window and throw up the sash. The
Companions were milling about below. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on down
there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thirty faces turned up to him, and Ban al&rsquo;Seen
yelled, &ldquo;It was Lord Luc, Lord Perrin. He nearly rode down Wil and
Tell. I don&rsquo;t think he even saw them. He was all hunched over in
his saddle like he was hurt, and spurring that stallion for all he
was worth, Lord Perrin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin tugged at his beard. Luc had certainly not
been wounded earlier. Luc&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and Slayer? It was impossible.
Dark-haired Slayer looked like Lan&rsquo;s brother or cousin; if Luc,
with his red-gold hair, resembled anyone, maybe it was Rand a
little. The two men could not have been more dissimilar. And yet&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;That cold smell. They did not smell the same, but both had an
icy, hardly human scent. His ears picked up the sound of wagons
being hauled out of the way down at the Old Road, shouts for haste.
Even if Ban and the Companions ran, they would not catch the man
now. Hooves galloped south hard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ban,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;if Luc shows up again, he&rsquo;s to be
put under guard and kept there.&rdquo; He paused long enough to add, &ldquo;And
don&rsquo;t call me that!&rdquo; before hauling the sash down with a bang.</p>

<p>Luc and Slayer; Slayer and Luc. How could they be the
same? It <em>was</em> impossible. But then, less than two years
gone he had not really believed in Trollocs or Fades. Time enough
to worry about it if he ever laid hands on the man again. Now there
was Watch Hill and Deven Ride and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Some could be saved. Not
everyone in the Two Rivers had to die.</p>

<p>On his way to the common room, he paused at the top
of the stairs. Aram stood up from the bottom step, watching him,
waiting to follow where he led. Gaul lay stretched out on a pallet
near the fireplace with a bandage thick around his left thigh,
apparently asleep. Faile and the two Maidens sat cross-legged on
the floor near him, talking softly. A much larger pallet lay on the
far side of the room, but Loial sat on a bench with his legs
stretched out so they would fit under one of the tables, nearly
doubled over so he could scribble furiously with a pen by the light
of a candle. No doubt he was recording what had happened on the
journey to close the Waygate. And if Perrin knew Loial at all, the
Ogier would have Gaul doing it all, whether he had or not. Loial
did not seem to think anything he himself did was brave, or worth
writing down. Except for them, the common room was empty. He could
still hear those fiddles playing. He thought he recognized the
tune. Not a Tinker song, now. &ldquo;My Love Is a Wild
Rose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faile looked up at Perrin&rsquo;s first step down, rising
gracefully to meet him. Aram took his seat again when Perrin made
no move toward the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your shirt is wet,&rdquo; Faile said accusingly. &ldquo;You
slept in it, didn&rsquo;t you? And your boots, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. It has
not been an hour since I left you. You march yourself back upstairs
before you fall down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see Luc leave?&rdquo; he said. Her mouth
tightened, but sometimes ignoring her was the only way. She managed
to win too often when he argued with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He came running through here a few minutes ago and
dashed out through the kitchen,&rdquo; she said finally. Those were the
words; her tone said she was not finished with him and bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he seem to be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;injured?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;He staggered, and he was
clutching something to his chest under his coat. A bandage, maybe.
Mistress Congar is in the kitchen, but from what I heard he all but
ran over her. How did you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dreamed it.&rdquo; Her tilted eyes took on a dangerous
light. She must not be thinking. She knew about the wolf dream; did
she expect him to explain where Bain and Chiad could hear, not to
mention Aram and Loial? Well, maybe not Loial; he was so absorbed
in his notes he would not have noticed a flock of sheep herded into
the common room. &ldquo;Gaul?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mistress Congar gave him something to make him
sleep, and a poultice for his leg. When the Aes Sedai wake in the
morning, one of them will Heal him, if they think it serious
enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come sit down, Faile. I want you to do something for
me.&rdquo; She eyed him suspiciously, but let him lead her to a chair.
When they were seated, he leaned across the table, trying to make
his voice serious, but not urgent. On no account urgent. &ldquo;I want
you to take a message to Caemlyn for me. On the way, you can let
Watch Hill know how things are here. Actually, it might be best if
they crossed the Taren until it&rsquo;s all done.&rdquo; That had sounded
properly casual; just a bit thrown in on the spur of the moment. &ldquo;I
want you to ask Queen Morgase to send us some of the Queen&rsquo;s
Guards. I know it&rsquo;s a dangerous thing I&rsquo;m asking, but Bain and
Chiad can get you to Taren Ferry safely, and the ferry is still
there.&rdquo; Chiad stood up, staring at him anxiously. Why was she
anxious?</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will not have to leave him,&rdquo; Faile told her.
After a moment the Aiel woman nodded and resumed her seat beside
Gaul. Chiad and Gaul? They were blood enemies. Nothing was making
sense tonight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a long way to Caemlyn,&rdquo; Faile went on quietly.
Her eyes very intent on his, but her face could have been wood for
all the expression it had. &ldquo;Weeks to ride there, plus however long
it might take to reach and convince Morgase, then more weeks to
return with the Queen&rsquo;s Guards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can hold out that long easily,&rdquo; he told her. <em>
Burn me if I can&rsquo;t lie as well as Mat!</em> &ldquo;Luc was right. There
can&rsquo;t be more than a thousand Trollocs still out there. The <em>
dream</em>?&rdquo; She nodded. At last she understood. &ldquo;We can hold out
here for a very long time, but in the meanwhile they&rsquo;ll be burning
crops and doing the Light knows what. We&rsquo;ll need the Queen&rsquo;s Guards
to rid ourselves of them completely. You are the logical one to go.
You know how to talk to a queen, being a queen&rsquo;s cousin and all.
Faile, I know what I&rsquo;m asking is dangerous&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Not as dangerous
as staying. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;But once you reach the ferry, you&rsquo;ll be on your
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not hear Loial approach until the Ogier laid
his book of notes down in front of Faile. &ldquo;I could not help
overhearing, Faile. If you are going to Caemlyn, would you carry
this? To keep it safe until I can come for it.&rdquo; Squaring the volume
up almost tenderly, he added, &ldquo;They print many very fine books in
Caemlyn. Forgive me for interrupting, Perrin.&rdquo; But his teacup eyes
were on her, not him. &ldquo;Faile suits you. You should fly free, like a
falcon.&rdquo; Patting Perrin on the shoulder, he murmured in a deep
rumble, &ldquo;She should fly free,&rdquo; then made his way to his pallet and
lay down facing the wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is very tired,&rdquo; Perrin said, attempting to make
it seem just a comment. The fool Ogier could ruin everything! &ldquo;If
you leave tonight, you can be at Watch Hill by daybreak. You&rsquo;ll
have to swing to the east; the Trollocs are fewer there. This is
very important to me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to Emond&rsquo;s Field, I mean. Will you do
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stared at him silently for so long he wondered if
she meant to answer. Her eyes seemed to glisten. Then she got up
and sat down on his lap, stroking his beard. &ldquo;This needs trimming.
I like it on you, but I do not want it down to your chest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He came close to gaping. She often changed the
subject on him, but usually when she was losing an argument.
&ldquo;Faile, please. I need you to carry this message to Caemlyn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her hand tightened in his beard, and her head swung
as if she were arguing with herself inside her head. &ldquo;I will go,&rdquo;
she said at last, &ldquo;but I want a price. You always make me do things
the hard way. In Saldaea, I would not have to be the one who asked.
My price is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a wedding. I want to marry you,&rdquo; she finished up
in a rush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I you.&rdquo; He smiled. &ldquo;We can say the betrothal
vows in front of the Women&rsquo;s Circle tonight, but I&rsquo;m afraid the
wedding has to wait a year. When you come back from Caemlyn&mdash;&rdquo;
She very nearly yanked a handful of beard out of his chin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will have you for husband tonight,&rdquo; she said in
fierce, low tones, &ldquo;or I will not go until I do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there was any way, I would,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;Daise
Congar would crack my head if I wanted to go against custom. For
the love of the Light, Faile, just carry the message, and I&rsquo;ll wed
you the very first day I can.&rdquo; He would. If that day ever came.</p>

<p>Suddenly she was very intent on his beard, smoothing
it and not meeting his eyes. She started speaking slowly but picked
up speed like a runaway horse. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;just happened to mention .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;in passing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I just <em>mentioned</em> to Mistress
al&rsquo;Vere how we had been traveling together&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how
it came up&mdash;and she said&mdash;and Mistress Congar agreed
with her&mdash;not that I talked to everybody!&mdash;she said
that we probably&mdash;certainly&mdash;could be considered
betrothed already under your customs, and the year is just to make
sure you really do get on well together&mdash;which we do, as
anyone can see&mdash;and here I am being as forward as some Domani
hussy or one of those Tairen galls&mdash;if you ever even <em>
think</em> of Berelain&mdash;oh, Light, I&rsquo;m babbling, and you
won&rsquo;t even&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He cut her off by kissing her as thoroughly as he
knew how.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you marry me?&rdquo; he said breathlessly when he was
done. &ldquo;Tonight?&rdquo; He must have done ever better with the kiss than
he thought; he had to repeat himself six times, with her giggling
against his throat and demanding he say it again, before she seemed
to understand.</p>

<p>Which was how he found himself not half an hour later
kneeling opposite her in the common room, in front of Daise Congar
and Marin al&rsquo;Vere, Alsbet Luhhan and Neysa Ayellin and all the
Women&rsquo;s Circle. Loial had been roused to stand for him with Aram,
and Bain and Chiad stood for Faile. There were no flowers to put in
her hair or his, but Bain, guided by Marin, tucked a long red
wedding ribbon around his neck, and Loial threaded another through
Faile&rsquo;s dark hair, his thick fingers surprisingly deft and gentle.
Perrin&rsquo;s hands trembled as he cupped hers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, Perrin Aybara, do pledge you my love, Faile
Bashere, for as long as I live.&rdquo; <em>For as long as I live and
after</em>. &ldquo;What I possess in this world I give to you.&rdquo; <em>A
horse, an axe, a bow. A hammer. Not much to gift a bride. I give
you life, my love. It&rsquo;s all I have</em>. &ldquo;I will keep and hold you,
succor and tend you, protect and shelter you, for all the days of
my life.&rdquo; <em>I can&rsquo;t keep you; the only way I can protect you is
to send you away</em>. &ldquo;I am yours, always and forever.&rdquo; By the
time he finished, his hands were shaking visibly.</p>

<p>Faile moved her hands to hold his. &ldquo;I, Zarine Bashere&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; That was a surprise; she hated that name. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;do pledge
you my love, Perrin Aybara&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Her hands never trembled at
all.</p>
