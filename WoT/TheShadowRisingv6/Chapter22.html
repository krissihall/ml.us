<h4><em>Out of the Stone</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t
was a strange procession Rand led out of the Stone
and eastward, with white clouds shading the midday sun and a breath
of air stirring across the city. By his order there had been no
announcement, no proclamation, but slowly word spread of <em>
something</em>: citizens stopped whatever they were doing and ran
for vantage points. The Aiel were marching through the city,
marching out of the city. People who had not seen them come in the
night, who had only half believed they were in the Stone at all,
increasingly lined the streets along the route, filled the windows,
even climbed onto slate rooftops, straddling roof peaks and
upturned corners. Murmurs ran as they counted the Aiel. These few
hundred could never have taken the Stone. The Dragon banner still
flew above the fortress. There must yet be thousands of Aiel in
there. And the Lord Dragon.</p>

<p>Rand rode easily in his shirtsleeves, sure none of
the onlookers could take him for anyone out of the ordinary. An
outlander, rich enough to ride&mdash;and on a superb dappled
stallion, best of the Tairen bloodstock&mdash;a rich man traveling
in the oddest of odd company, but surely just another man for that.
Not even the leader of this strange company; that title was surely
assigned to Lan or Moiraine despite the fact that they rode some
little distance behind him, directly ahead of the Aiel. The soft
awed susurration that accompanied his passing certainly rose for
the Aiel, not him. These Tairen folk might even take him for a
groom, riding his master&rsquo;s horse. Well, no, not that; not out in
front as he was. It was a fine day, anyway. Not sweltering, merely
warm. No one expected him to mete out justice, or rule a nation. He
could simply enjoy riding in anonymity, enjoy the rare breeze. For
a time he could forget the feel of his heron branded palms on the
reins. <em>For a little longer anyway</em>, he thought. <em>A
little longer</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand,&rdquo; Egwene said, &ldquo;do you really think it was
right to let the Aiel take all those things?&rdquo; He looked around as
she heeled her gray mare, Mist, up beside him. From somewhere she
had gotten a dark green dress with narrow divided skirts, and a
green velvet band held her hair at the nape of her neck.</p>

<p>Moiraine and Lan still hung back half a dozen
strides, she on her white mare in a full skirted blue silk riding
dress slashed with green, her dark hair caught in a golden net, he
astride his great black warhorse, in a color shifting Warder&rsquo;s
cloak that probably brought as many <em>oohs</em> and <em>aahs</em>
as the Aiel. When the breeze stirred the cloak, shades of green and
brown and gray rippled across it; when it hung still it somehow
seemed to fade into whatever was beyond it, so the eye appeared to
be seeing <em>through</em> parts of Lan and his mount. It was not
comfortable to look at.</p>

<p>Mat was there, too, slumped in his saddle and looking
resigned, trying to keep apart from the Warder and Aes Sedai. He
had chosen a nondescript brown gelding, an animal he called Pips;
it took a good eye to notice the deep chest and strong withers that
promised blunt-nosed Pips could likely match Rand&rsquo;s stallion or
Lan&rsquo;s for speed and endurance. Mat&rsquo;s decision to come had been a
surprise; Rand still did not know why. Friendship, maybe, and then
again, maybe not. Mat could be odd in what he did and why.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t your friend Aviendha explain to you about
&lsquo;the fifth&rsquo;?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She mentioned something, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Rand, you don&rsquo;t
think she&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>took</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;things, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Behind Moiraine and Lan, behind Mat, behind Rhuarc at
their head, the Aiel walked in long lines to either side of loaded
pack mules, rank on rank four abreast. When Aiel took one of the
holds of an enemy clan in the Waste, by custom&mdash;or maybe law;
Rand did not understand it exactly&mdash;they carried away one
fifth of all it contained, excepting only food. They had seen no
reason not to treat the Stone the same. Not that the mules held
more than the barest fraction of a fraction of a fifth of the
Stone&rsquo;s treasures. Rhuarc said greed had killed more men than
steel. The wickerwork pack hampers, topped with rolled carpets and
wall hangings, were lightly laden. Ahead lay an eventual hard
crossing of the Spine of the World, and then a far harder trek
across the Waste.</p>

<p><em>When do I tell them?</em> he wondered. <em>Soon,
now; it has to be soon</em>. Moiraine would doubtless think it
daring, a bold stroke; she might even approve. Maybe. She thought
she knew his whole plan, now, and made no bones of disapproving
that; no doubt she wanted it over and done as soon as possible. But
the Aiel&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>What if they refuse? Well, if they refuse, they
refuse. I have to do it</em>. As for the fifth&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He did not
think it would have been possible to stop the Aiel from taking it
even had he wanted to, and he had not; they had earned their
rewards, and he had no care to help Tairen lords keep what they had
wrung from their people over generations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw her showing Rhuarc a silver bowl,&rdquo; he said
aloud. &ldquo;From the way her sack clinked when she stuffed the bowl in,
there was more silver in there. Or maybe gold. Do you
disapprove?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; She drew the word out slowly, with a touch of
doubt, but then her voice firmed. &ldquo;I just hadn&rsquo;t thought of her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The Tairens would not have stopped at a fifth if the positions
had been reversed. They&rsquo;d have carted away whatever wasn&rsquo;t part of
the stonework, and stolen all the carts to haul it. Just because a
people&rsquo;s ways are different doesn&rsquo;t mean they are wrong, Rand. You
should know that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed softly. This was almost like old times, he
ready to explain why and how she was wrong, and she snatching his
position and tossing his own unvoiced explanation at him. His
stallion danced a few steps, catching his mood. He patted the
dapple&rsquo;s arched neck. A good day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine horse,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What have you named
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jeade&rsquo;en,&rdquo; he said cautiously, losing some of his
good spirits. He was a little ashamed of the name, of his reasons
for choosing it. One of his favorite books had always been <em>The
Travels of Jain Farstrider</em>, and that great traveler had named
his horse Jeade&rsquo;en&mdash;True Finder, in the Old Tongue&mdash;because the animal had always been able to find the way home. It
would have been nice to think Jeade&rsquo;en might carry him home one
day. Nice, but not likely, and he did not want anyone suspecting
the cause for the name. Boyish fancies had no place in his life
now. There was not much room for anything but what he had to
do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fine name,&rdquo; she said absently. He knew she had
read the book, too, and half expected her to recognize the name,
but she seemed to be mulling over something else, chewing her lower
lip pensively.</p>

<p>He was content with silence. The last dregs of the
city gave way to country and pitiful scattered farms. Not even a
Congar or a Coplin, Two River folk notorious for laziness among
other things, would keep a place as run down and ramshackle as
these rough stone houses, walls slanting as if about to topple over
on the chickens scratching in the dirt. Sagging barns leaned
against laurels or spicewoods. Roofs of cracked and broken slates
all looked as if they leaked. Goats bleated disconsolately in stone
pens that might have been thrown together hastily that morning.
Barefoot men and women hoed stoop shouldered in unfenced fields,
not looking up even when the large party was passing. Redbeaks and
thrushes warbling in the small thickets were not enough to lighten
the feel of oppressive gloom.</p>

<p><em>I have to do something about this. I</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>No, not now. First things first. I&rsquo;ve done what I could for
them in a few weeks. I can&rsquo;t do anything more now</em>. He tried
not to look at the tumbledown farms. Were the olive groves in the
south as bad? The people who worked those did not even own the
land; it all belonged to High Lords. <em>No. The breeze. Nice, the
way it cuts the heat. I can enjoy it a bit longer. I have to tell
them, soon now</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand,&rdquo; Egwene said abruptly, &ldquo;I want to talk to
you.&rdquo; Something serious by her expression; those big dark eyes,
fixed on him, held a light reminiscent of Nynaeve&rsquo;s when she was
about to lecture. &ldquo;I want to talk about Elayne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about her?&rdquo; he asked warily. He touched his
pouch, where two letters crinkled against a small hard object. If
they had not both been in the same elegantly flowing hand, he would
not have believed they came from the same woman. And after all that
kissing and snuggling. The High Lords were easier to understand
than women.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you let her go in that way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Puzzled, he stared at her. &ldquo;She wanted to go. I&rsquo;d
have had to tie her up to stop her. Besides, she&rsquo;ll be safer in
Tanchico than near me&mdash;or Mat&mdash;if we are going to
attract bubbles of evil the way Moiraine says. You would be,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t what I mean at all. Of course she wanted
to go. And you had no right to stop her. But why didn&rsquo;t you tell
her you wished she would stay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She wanted to go,&rdquo; he repeated, and grew more
confused when she rolled her eyes as if he were speaking gibberish.
If he had no right to stop Elayne, and she wanted to go, why was he
supposed to try to talk her out of it? Especially when she was
safer gone.</p>

<p>Moiraine spoke, right behind him. &ldquo;Are you ready to
tell me the next secret? It has been clear you were keeping
something from me. At the least I might be able to tell you if you
are leading us over a cliff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand sighed. He had not heard her and Lan closing up
on him. And Mat as well, although still holding a distance between
himself and the Aes Sedai. Mat&rsquo;s face was a study, doubt and
reluctance and grim determination all running across it by turns,
especially when he glanced at Moiraine. He never looked at her
directly, only from the edge of his eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you want to come, Mat?&rdquo; Rand asked.</p>

<p>Mat shrugged and affected a grin, not a very
confident one. &ldquo;Who could pass up a chance to see bloody Rhuidean?&rdquo;
Egwene raised her eyebrows at him. &ldquo;Oh, pardon my language, <em>Aes
Sedai</em>. I&rsquo;ve heard you say as bad, and for less cause, I&rsquo;ll
wager.&rdquo; Egwene stared at him indignantly, but spots of color in her
cheeks said he had scored a hit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be glad Mat <em>is</em> here,&rdquo; Moiraine said to
Rand, her voice cool, and not pleased. &ldquo;You made a grave error
letting Perrin run off, hiding his going from me. The world rests
on your shoulders, but they must both support you or you will fall,
and the world with you.&rdquo; Mat flinched, and Rand thought he very
nearly turned his gelding and rode away on the spot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know my duty,&rdquo; he told her. <em>And I know my
fate</em>, he thought, but he did not say that aloud; he was not
asking sympathy. &ldquo;One of us had to go back, Moiraine, and Perrin
wanted to. You&rsquo;re willing to let anything go to save the world. I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I do what I have to.&rdquo; The Warder nodded, though he said
nothing; Lan would not disagree with Moiraine in front of
others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the next secret?&rdquo; she said insistently. She
would not give up until she had ferreted it out, and he had no
reason to keep it secret any longer. Not this part of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Portal Stones,&rdquo; he said simply. &ldquo;If we are
lucky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Light!&rdquo; Mat groaned. &ldquo;Bloody flaming Light!
Don&rsquo;t grimace at me, Egwene! Lucky? Isn&rsquo;t once enough, Rand? You
almost killed us, remember? No, worse than killed. I would rather
ride back to one of those farms and ask for a job slopping pigs the
rest of my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can go your own way if you want, Mat,&rdquo; Rand told
him. Moiraine&rsquo;s calm face was a mask over fury, but he ignored the
icy stare that tried to still his tongue. Even Lan looked
disapproving, for all his hard face did not change very much; the
Warder believed in duty before anything else. Rand would do his
duty, but his friends&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He did not like making people do
things; he would not do it to his friends. That much he could
avoid, surely. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no reason to come to the Waste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes I do. At least&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Oh, burn me! I&rsquo;ve one
life to give away, don&rsquo;t I? Why not like this?&rdquo; Mat laughed
nervously, and a bit wildly. &ldquo;Bloody Portal Stones! Light!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand frowned; he was the one they all said was
supposed to go mad, but Mat was the one who seemed on the edge of
it now.</p>

<p>Egwene blinked at Mat worriedly, but it was Rand she
leaned toward. &ldquo;Rand, Verin Sedai told me a little about Portal
Stones. She told me about the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;journey you took. Do you really
mean to do this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what I have to do, Egwene.&rdquo; He had to move
quickly, and there was no quicker way than Portal Stones. Remnants
of an Age older than the Age of Legends; even Aes Sedai of the Age
of Legends had not understood them, it seemed. But there was no
quicker way. If it worked the way he hoped.</p>

<p>Moiraine had listened to the exchange patiently.
Especially to Mat&rsquo;s part of it, though Rand could not see why. Now
she said, &ldquo;Verin also told me of your journey using Portal Stones.
That was only a few people and horses, not hundreds, and if you did
not almost kill everyone as Mat says, it yet sounded an experience
no one would wish to repeat. Nor did it turn out as you expected.
It also required a great deal of the Power; almost enough to kill
you at least, Verin said. Even if you leave most of the Aiel behind,
do you dare risk the attempt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to,&rdquo; he said, feeling at his belt pouch, at
the small hard shape behind the letters, but she went right on as
if he had not spoken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you even certain there <em>is</em> a Portal
Stone in the Waste? Verin certainly knows more of them than I, but
I have never heard of one. If there is, will it place us any closer
to Rhuidean than we are right now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some six hundred or so years ago,&rdquo; he told her, &ldquo;a
peddler tried to get a look at Rhuidean.&rdquo; Another time it would
have been a pleasure to be able to lecture her for a change. Not
today. There was too much he did not know. &ldquo;This fellow apparently
didn&rsquo;t see anything of it; he claimed to have seen a golden city up
in the clouds, drifting over the mountains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are no cities in the Waste,&rdquo; Lan said, &ldquo;in the
clouds or on the ground. I&rsquo;ve fought the Aiel. They have no
cities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene nodded. &ldquo;Aviendha told me she had never seen a
city until she left the Waste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe so,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;But the peddler also saw
something sticking out of the side of one of those mountains. A
Portal Stone. He described it perfectly. There isn&rsquo;t anything else
like a Portal Stone. When I described one to the chief librarian in
the Stone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Without naming what he was after, he did not add.
&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;he recognized it, even if he didn&rsquo;t know what it was, enough
to show me four on an old map of Tear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four?&rdquo; Moiraine sounded startled. &ldquo;All in Tear?
Portal Stones are not so common as that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four,&rdquo; Rand said definitely. The bony old librarian
had been certain, even digging out a tattered yellowed manuscript
telling of efforts to move the &ldquo;unknown artifacts of an earlier
Age&rdquo; to the Great Holding. Every attempt had failed, and the
Tairens had finally given up. That was confirmation to Rand; Portal
Stones resisted being moved. &ldquo;One lies not an hour&rsquo;s ride from
where we are,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;The Aiel allowed the peddler to
leave, since he was a peddler. With one of his mules and as much
water as he could carry on his back. Somehow he made it as far as a
<em>stedding</em> in the Spine of the World, where he met a man
named Soran Milo, who was writing a book called <em>The Killers of
the Black Veil</em>. The librarian brought me a battered copy when
I asked for books on the Aiel. Milo apparently based it all on Aiel
who came to trade at the <em>stedding</em>, and he got almost
everything wrong anyway, according to Rhuarc, but a Portal Stone
can&rsquo;t be anything but a Portal Stone.&rdquo; He had examined other maps
and manuscripts, dozens of them, supposedly studying Tear and its
history, learning the land; <em>no</em> one could have had a clue
what he intended before a few minutes ago.</p>

<p>Moiraine sniffed, and her white mare, Aldieb, frisked
a few steps, picking up her irritation. &ldquo;A supposed story told by a
supposed peddler who claimed to have seen a golden city floating in
the clouds. Has Rhuarc seen this Portal Stone? He has actually been
to Rhuidean. Even if this peddler did go into the Waste, and did
see a Portal Stone, it could have been anywhere. A man telling a
story usually tries to better what really happened. A city floating
in the clouds?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know it doesn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; he said. Rhuarc had
been willing to laugh at all the wrong things Milo had written
about Aiel, but he had not been very forthcoming about Rhuidean.
No, more than that; or less, rather. The Aielman had refused even
to comment on the parts of the book supposedly about Rhuidean.
Rhuidean, in the lands of the Jenn Aiel, the clan which is not;
that was almost the extent of what Rhuarc would say about it.
Rhuidean was not to be spoken of.</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai was not best pleased with his flippant
remark, but he did not care. She had kept too many secrets herself,
made him follow her on blind trust too often. Let it be her turn.
She had to learn that he was not a puppet. <em>I&rsquo;ll take her advice
when I think it&rsquo;s right, but I won&rsquo;t dance on Tar Valon&rsquo;s strings
again</em>. He would die on his own terms.</p>

<p>Egwene moved her gray horse closer, riding almost
knee to knee with him. &ldquo;Rand, do you really mean to risk our lives
on a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a chance? Rhuarc did not tell you anything, did he? When
I ask Aviendha about Rhuidean, she shuts up tight as a hickory
nut.&rdquo; Mat looked sick.</p>

<p>Rand kept his face still, not letting his flash of
shame show. He had not meant to frighten his friends. &ldquo;There is a
Portal Stone there,&rdquo; he maintained. He rubbed the hard shape in his
pouch again. This had to work.</p>

<p>The librarian&rsquo;s maps had been old, but in a way that
was a help. The grasslands they rode now had been forest when
those maps were drawn, but few trees remained, far-scattered
scraggly copses of white oak and pine and maidenhair, tall solitary
trees he did not recognize, with gnarled spindly trunks. He could
make out the shape of the land easily, hills shrouded mainly in
high grass now.</p>

<p>On the maps two tall bent ridges, one close behind
the other, had pointed to the cluster of round hills where the
Portal Stone was. If the maps had been well made. If the librarian
really had recognized his description, and the green diamond mark
actually meant ancient ruins as he claimed. <em>Why would he lie?
I&rsquo;m getting too suspicious. No, I have to be suspicious. As
trusting as a viper, and as cold</em>. He did not like it,
though.</p>

<p>To the north he could just make out hills with no
trees at all, speckled with moving shapes that must be horses. The
High Lords&rsquo; herds, grazing across the site of the old Ogier grove.
He hoped Perrin and Loial had gotten away safely. <em>Help them,
Perrin</em>, he thought. <em>Help them somehow, because I
can&rsquo;t</em>.</p>

<p>The Ogier grove meant the folded ridges must be
close, and soon he spotted them a little to the south, like two
arrows one inside the other, a few trees along the top making a
thin line against the sky. Beyond, low round hills like grass-covered
bubbles ran into one another. More hills than on the old
map. Too many, for all the patch encompassed less than a square
mile. If they did not correspond to the map, which one held the
Portal Stone on its side?</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Aiel have numbers,&rdquo; Lan said quietly, &ldquo;and sharp
eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a nod of gratitude, Rand reined Jeade&rsquo;en in,
falling back to put the problem before Rhuarc. He only described
the Portal Stone, not saying what it was; there would be time
enough for that when it was found. He was good at keeping secrets
now. Rhuarc probably had no idea what a Portal Stone was, anyway.
Few did except for Aes Sedai. He had not known until someone told
him.</p>

<p>Striding along beside the dapple stallion, the
Aielman frowned slightly&mdash;as much as a worried grimace from most
other men&mdash;then nodded. &ldquo;We can find this thing.&rdquo; He raised his
voice. &ldquo;<em>Aethan Dor! Far Aldazar Din! Duadhe Mahdi&rsquo;in! Far
Dareis Mai! Seia Doon! Sha&rsquo;mad Conde!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he called out, members of the named warrior
societies trotted forward, until a good quarter of the Aiel
clustered around him and Rand. Red Shields. Brothers of the Eagle.
Water Seekers. Maidens of the Spear. Black Eyes. Thunder
Walkers.</p>

<p>Rand picked out Egwene&rsquo;s friend, Aviendha, a tall,
pretty woman with a haughty unsmiling stare. Maidens had guarded
his door, but he did not think he had seen her before the Aiel
gathered to leave the Stone. She looked back at him, proud as a
green-eyed hawk, then tossed her head and turned her attention to
the clan chief.</p>

<p><em>Well, I wanted to be ordinary again</em>, he
thought, a touch ruefully. The Aiel certainly gave him that. They
offered even the clan chief only a respectful hearing, without any
of the elaborate deference a lord would exact, and obedience that
seemed between equals. He could hardly expect more for himself.</p>

<p>Rhuarc gave instructions in few words, and the
listening Aiel fanned out ahead into the patch of hills, running
easily, some veiling themselves just in case. The rest waited,
standing or squatting beside the loaded pack mules.</p>

<p>They represented almost every clan&mdash;except the
Jenn Aiel, of course; Rand could not get it straight whether the
Jenn really existed or not, since the way the Aiel mentioned them,
which they seldom did, it could be either way&mdash;including some
clans that had blood feuds, and others that often fought each
other. He had learned that much about them. Not for the first time,
he wondered what had held them together so far. Was it just their
prophecies of the Stone falling, and the search for He Who Comes
With the Dawn?</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than that,&rdquo; Rhuarc said, and Rand realized he
had spoken his thoughts aloud. &ldquo;Prophecy brought us over the
Dragonwall, and the name that is not spoken drew us to the Stone of
Tear.&rdquo; The name he meant was &ldquo;People of the Dragon,&rdquo; a secret name
for the Aiel; only clan chiefs and Wise Ones knew or used it,
apparently seldom and only with each other. &ldquo;For the rest? No one
may shed the blood of another of the same society, of course, yet
mixing Shaarad with Goshien, Taardad and Nakai with Shaido&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Even I might have danced the spears with the Shaido, if the Wise
Ones had not made everyone who crossed the Dragonwall swear water
oath to treat any Aiel as of the same society on this side of the
mountains. Even sneaking Shaido&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He shrugged slightly. &ldquo;You
see? It is not easy, even for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These Shaido are enemies of yours?&rdquo; Rand fumbled the
name; in the Stone, the Aiel had gone by societies, not clans.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have avoided blood feud,&rdquo; Rhuarc said, &ldquo;but
Taardad and Shaido have never been friendly; the septs sometimes
raid each other, steal goats or cattle. But the oaths have held
with us all against three blood feuds and a dozen old hatreds
between clans or septs. It helps now that we journey toward
Rhuidean, even if some will leave us before. None may shed the
blood of one traveling to or from Rhuidean.&rdquo; The Aielman looked up
at Rand, face completely expressionless. &ldquo;It may be that soon no
one of us will shed another&rsquo;s blood.&rdquo; It was impossible to say
whether he found the prospect pleasing.</p>

<p>An ululating cry came from one of the Maidens,
standing atop a hill and waving her arms over her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have found your stone column, it seems,&rdquo; Rhuarc
said.</p>

<p>Gathering her reins, Moiraine gave Rand a level look
as he rode past her, eagerly heeling Jeade&rsquo;en to a gallop. Egwene
reined her mare near to Mat, leaning from her saddle with a hand on
the high pommel of his to engage him in close conversation. She
seemed to be trying to make him tell her something, or admit
something, and from the vehemence of Mat&rsquo;s gestures, he was either
innocent as a babe or lying in his teeth.</p>

<p>Flinging himself out of the saddle, Rand hurriedly
climbed up the gentle slope to examine what the Maiden&mdash;it
was Aviendha&mdash;had found half buried in the ground and
obscured by long grass. A weathered gray stone column, at least
three spans long and a pace thick. Strange symbols covered every
exposed inch, each surrounded by a narrow line of markings he
thought were writing. Even if he could have read the language&mdash;if it was one&mdash;the script&mdash;if that was what it
was&mdash;had long since worn to illegibility. The symbols he
could make out a little better. Some of them; many might as well
have been the marks of rain and wind.</p>

<p>Pulling grass by the handful so he could see better,
he glanced at Aviendha. She had dropped her <em>shoufa</em> around
her shoulders, baring short reddish hair, and was watching him with
a flat, hard expression. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; There
was one symbol he had to find, the only one he knew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like you?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You may be He Who Comes With
the Dawn, a man of destiny. Who can like or dislike such? Besides,
you walk free, a wetlander despite your face, yet going to Rhuidean
for honor, while I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;While you what?&rdquo; he asked when she stopped. He
searched his way slowly upslope. Where was it? Two parallel wavy
lines crossed at an angle by an odd squiggle. <em>Light, if it&rsquo;s
buried, it&rsquo;ll take us hours to turn this over</em>. Abruptly he
laughed. Not hours. He could channel and lift the thing out of the
ground, or Moiraine could, or Egwene. A Portal Stone might resist
being moved, but surely they could move it that much. Channeling
would not help him find the wavy lines, though. Only feeling his
way along the stone would do that.</p>

<p>Instead of answering, the Aiel woman squatted easily
with her short spears across her knees. &ldquo;You have treated Elayne
badly. I would not care, but Elayne is near-sister to Egwene, who
is my friend. Yet Egwene likes you still, so for her sake I will
try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still searching the thick column, he shook his head.
Elayne again. Sometimes he thought women all belonged to a guild,
the way craftsmen in cities did. Put a foot wrong with one, and the
next ten you met knew of it, and disapproved.</p>

<p>His fingers stopped, returned to the bit he had just
examined. It was weathered almost beyond making out, but he was
sure it was the wavy lines. They represented a Portal Stone on
Toman Head, not in the Waste, but they located what had been the
base of the thing when it stood upright. Symbols at the top
represented worlds; those at the bottom, Portal Stones. With a
symbol from the top and one from the bottom, he could supposedly
travel to a given Portal Stone in a given world. With just one from
the bottom, he knew he could reach a Portal Stone in this world.
The Portal Stone near Rhuidean, for instance. If he knew the symbol
for it. Now was when he needed luck, needed that <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>
tugging at chance to favor him.</p>

<p>A hand reached over his shoulder, and Rhuarc said in
a reluctant voice, &ldquo;These two are used for Rhuidean in old
writings. Long ago, even the name was not written.&rdquo; He traced two
triangles, each surrounding what appeared to be forked lightnings,
one pointing left, one right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know what this is?&rdquo; Rand asked. The Aielman
looked away. &ldquo;Burn me, Rhuarc, I have to know. I know you don&rsquo;t
want to talk of it, but you have to tell me. Tell me, Rhuarc. Have
you ever seen its like before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other man took a deep breath before answering. &ldquo;I
have seen its like.&rdquo; Each word came as if dragged. &ldquo;When a man goes
to Rhuidean, Wise Ones and clansmen wait on the slopes of Chaendaer
near a stone like this.&rdquo; Aviendha stood up and walked away stiffly;
Rhuarc glanced after her, frowning. &ldquo;I know no more of it, Rand
al&rsquo;Thor. May I never know shade if I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand traced the unreadable script surrounding the
triangles. Which one? Only one would take him where he wanted to
go. The second might land him on the other side of the world, or
the bottom of the ocean.</p>

<p>The rest of the Aiel had gathered at the foot of the
hill with their pack mules. Moiraine and the others dismounted and
climbed the easy slope, leading their horses. Mat had Jeade&rsquo;en as
well as his own brown gelding, keeping the stallion well away from
Lan&rsquo;s Mandarb. The two stallions eyed one another fiercely now that
they had no riders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You truly don&rsquo;t know what you are doing, do you?&rdquo;
Egwene protested. &ldquo;Moiraine, stop him. We can ride to Rhuidean. Why
are you letting him go on with this? Why don&rsquo;t you say
something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would you suggest I do?&rdquo; the Aes Sedai said
dryly. &ldquo;I can hardly drag him away by his ear. We may be about to
see how useful Dreaming really is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dreaming?&rdquo; Egwene said sharply. &ldquo;What does Dreaming
have to do with this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you two be quiet?&rdquo; Rand made himself sound
patient. &ldquo;I am trying to decide.&rdquo; Egwene stared at him indignantly;
Moiraine showed no emotion at all, but she watched intently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do we have to do it this way?&rdquo; Mat said. &ldquo;What do
you have against riding?&rdquo; Rand only looked at him, and he shrugged
uncomfortably. &ldquo;Oh, burn me. If you&rsquo;re trying to decide&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;
Taking both horses&rsquo; reins in one hand, he dug a coin from his
pocket, a gold Tar Valon mark, and sighed. &ldquo;It would be the same
coin, wouldn&rsquo;t it.&rdquo; He rolled the coin across the backs of his
fingers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;lucky sometimes, Rand. Let my luck choose.
Head, the one that points to your right; flame, the other. What do
you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the most ridiculous,&rdquo; Egwene began, but
Moiraine silenced her with a touch on the arm.</p>

<p>Rand nodded. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Egwene muttered something;
all he caught were &ldquo;men&rdquo; and &ldquo;boys,&rdquo; but it did not sound a
compliment.</p>

<p>The coin spun into the air off Mat&rsquo;s thumb, gleaming
dully in the sun. At its peak, Mat snatched it back and slapped it
down on the back of his other hand, then hesitated. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bloody
thing to be trusting to the toss of a coin, Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand laid his palm on one of the symbols without
looking. &ldquo;This one,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You chose this one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat peeked at the coin and blinked. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right.
How did you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has to work for me sooner or later.&rdquo; None of them
understood&mdash;he could see that&mdash;but it did not matter.
Lifting his hand, he looked at what he and Mat had picked. The
triangle pointed left. The sun had slid down from its apex. He had
to do this right. A mistake, and they could lose time, not gain it.
That had to be the worst outcome. It had to be.</p>

<p>Standing, he dug into his pouch and pulled out the
small hard object, a carving of shiny dark green stone that fit
easily into his hand, a round-faced round-bodied man sitting
cross-legged with a sword across his knees. He rubbed a thumb over the
figure&rsquo;s bald head. &ldquo;Gather everyone close. Everyone. Rhuarc, have
them bring those pack animals up here. Everyone has to be as close
to me as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; the Aielman asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to Rhuidean.&rdquo; Rand bounced the carving
on his palm and bent to pat the Portal Stone. &ldquo;To Rhuidean. Right
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rhuarc gave him a long flat look, then straightened,
already calling to the other Aiel.</p>

<p>Moiraine took a step closer up the grassy slope.
&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; she asked curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An <em>angreal,</em>&rdquo; Rand said, turning it in his
hand. &ldquo;One that works for men. I found it in the Great Holding when
I was hunting that doorway. It was the sword that made me pick it
up, and then I knew. If you are wondering how I mean to channel
enough of the Power to take us all&mdash;Aiel, pack mules,
everybody and everything&mdash;this is it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand,&rdquo; Egwene said anxiously, &ldquo;I am sure you think
you are doing what is best, but are you certain? Are you certain
that <em>angreal</em> is strong enough? I can&rsquo;t even be sure it
<em>is</em> one. I believe you if you say it is, but <em>
angreal</em> vary, Rand. At least, those that women can use do.
Some are more potent than others, and size or shape is no
guide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m certain,&rdquo; he lied. There had been no
way to test it, not for this purpose, not without letting half of
Tear know he was up to something, but he thought it would do. Just.
And as small as it was, no one would know it was gone from the
Stone unless they decided to inventory the Holding. Not likely,
that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You leave <em>Callandor</em> behind and bring this,&rdquo;
Moiraine murmured. &ldquo;You seem to have considerable knowledge of
using Portal Stones. More than I would have thought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Verin told me a good bit,&rdquo; he said. Verin had, but
it had been Lanfear who first explained them to him. He had known
her as Selene, then, but he did not intend explaining that to
Moiraine any more than he would tell her of the woman&rsquo;s offer of
help. The Aes Sedai had taken the news of Lanfear&rsquo;s appearance too
calmly, even for her. And she had that weighing look in her eyes,
as if she had him on balance scales in her mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take a care, Rand al&rsquo;Thor,&rdquo; she said in that icy,
musical voice. &ldquo;Any <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> shapes the Pattern to one
degree or another, but a <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> such as you might rip
the Age Lace for all of time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He wished he knew what she was thinking. He wished he
knew what <em>she</em> was planning.</p>

<p>The Aiel climbed the hill with their pack mules,
covering the slope as they crowded close around him and the Portal
Stone, crowding in shoulder to shoulder on everyone but Moiraine
and Egwene. Those two they left a little space. Rhuarc nodded at
him as if saying, It is done, it is in your hands now.</p>

<p>Hefting the shiny green <em>angreal</em>, he thought
of telling the Aiel to leave the animals, but there was the
question of whether they would, and he wanted to arrive with all of
them, with all feeling he had done well by them. Goodwill might be
in short supply in the Waste. They watched him with imperturbable
faces. Some had veiled themselves, though. Mat, nervously rolling
that Tar Valon mark across the backs of his fingers over and over,
and Egwene, sweat beading on her face, were the only ones who
seemed anxious. There was no point in waiting any longer. He had to
move faster than anyone thought he could.</p>

<p>He wrapped himself in the Void and reached out for
the True Source, that sickly flickering light that was always
there, just over his shoulder. The Power filled him, breath of
life, wind to uproot oaks, summer wind sweetened with flowers, foul
waftings from a midden heap. Floating in emptiness, he fixed the
lightning-laced triangle before him and reached through the <em>
angreal</em>, drew deeply at the raging torrent of <em>saidin</em>.
He had to carry them all. It had to work. Holding that symbol, he
pulled at the One Power, pulled it into him until he was sure he
would burst. Pulled more. More.</p>

<p>The world seemed to wink out of existence.</p>
