<h4><em>Among the Tuatha&rsquo;an</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">A</span>
 gathering of wagons came in sight, a little off to
the south, like small houses on wheels, tall wooden boxes, painted
and lacquered in violent shades of red and blue and green and
yellow, all standing in a large, rough circle around a few
broad-limbed oak trees. The music came from there. Perrin had heard
there were Tinkers, Traveling People, in the Two Rivers, but he had
not seen them until now. Hobbled horses cropped the long grass
nearby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will sleep elsewhere,&rdquo; Gaul said stiffly when he
saw Perrin meant to go to the wagons, and loped away without
another word.</p>

<p>Bain and Chiad spoke softly yet urgently to Faile.
Perrin caught enough to know they were trying to convince her to
spend the night with them in some snug thicket and not with &ldquo;the
Lost Ones.&rdquo; They sounded appalled at the idea of speaking to the
Tinkers, much less eating or sleeping with them. Faile&rsquo;s hand
tightened on his leg as she refused, quietly, firmly. The two
Maidens frowned at each other, blue eyes meeting gray with a deep
measure of concern, but before the Traveling People&rsquo;s wagons came
much closer, they trotted away after Gaul. They seemed to have
recovered some of their spirits, though. Perrin heard Chiad
suggesting they induce Gaul to play some game called Maidens&rsquo; Kiss.
They were both laughing as they passed out of his earshot.</p>

<p>Men and women were working in the camp, sewing,
mending harness, cooking, washing clothes and children, levering a
wagon up to replace a wheel. Other children ran playing, or danced
to the tunes of half a dozen men playing fiddle or flute. From
oldest to youngest, the Tinkers wore clothes even more colorful
than their wagons, in eye-wrenching combinations that had to have
been chosen blindly. No sane man would have worn anything near
those hues, and not many women.</p>

<p>As the ragtag party approached the wagons, silence
fell, people stopping where they were to watch with worried
expressions, women clutching infants and children running to hide
behind adults, peering around a leg or hiding their faces in
skirts. A wiry man, gray-haired and short, stepped forward and
bowed gravely, both hands pressed to his chest. He wore a bright
blue, high-collared coat and baggy trousers of a green that almost
seemed to glow tucked into kneeboots. &ldquo;You are welcome to our
fires. Do you know the song?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment, trying not to hunch around the arrow in
him, Perrin could only stare. He knew this man, the Mahdi, or
Seeker, of this band. <em>What chance?</em> he wondered. <em>Of all
the Tinkers in the world, what chance it should be folk I
know?</em> Coincidences made him uneasy; when the Pattern produced
coincidence, the Wheel seemed to be forcing events. <em>I&rsquo;m
beginning to sound like a bloody Aes Sedai</em>. He could not
manage the bow, but he remembered the ritual. &ldquo;Your welcome warms
my spirit, Raen, as your fires warm the flesh, but I do not know
the song.&rdquo; Faile and Ihvon gave him startled looks, but no more
than did the Two Rivers men. Judging by the mutters he heard from
Ban and Tell and others, he had just given them something else to
talk about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we seek still,&rdquo; the wiry man intoned. &ldquo;As it
was, so shall it be, if we but remember, seek, and find.&rdquo;
Grimacing, he surveyed the bloody faces confronting him, his eyes
flinching away from the weapons. The Traveling People would not
touch anything they considered a weapon, &ldquo;You are welcome to our
fires. There will be hot water, and bandages and poultices. You
know my name,&rdquo; he added, looking at Perrin searchingly. &ldquo;Of course.
Your eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Raen&rsquo;s wife had come to his side as he spoke, a plump
woman, gray-haired but smooth-cheeked, a head taller than her
husband. Her red blouse and bright yellow skirt and green-fringed
shawl jarred the eye, but she had a motherly manner. &ldquo;Perrin
Aybara!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I thought I knew your face. Is Elyas with
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin shook his head. &ldquo;I have not seen him in a long
time, Ila.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He leads a life of violence,&rdquo; Raen said sadly. &ldquo;As
you do. A violent life is stained even if long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not try to bring him to the Way of the Leaf
standing here, Raen,&rdquo; Ila said briskly, but not unkindly. &ldquo;He is
hurt. They all are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What am I thinking of?&rdquo; Raen muttered. Raising his
voice, he called, &ldquo;Come, people. Come and help. They are hurt. Come
and help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Men and women gathered quickly, murmuring their
sympathy as they helped injured men down from their horses, guiding
men toward their wagons, carrying them when necessary. Wil and a
few of the others looked concerned over being separated, but Perrin
was not. Violence was the farthest thing from the Tuatha&rsquo;an. They
would not raise a hand against anyone, even to defend their own
lives.</p>

<p>Perrin found he had to accept Ihvon&rsquo;s assistance to
dismount. Climbing down sent jolts of pain radiating out from his
side. &ldquo;Raen,&rdquo; he said, a touch breathless, &ldquo;you shouldn&rsquo;t be out
here. We fought Trollocs not five miles from this spot. Take your
people to Emond&rsquo;s Field. They will be safe there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Raen hesitated&mdash;and seemed surprised at it&mdash;before shaking his head. &ldquo;Even if I wished to, the people
would not want it, Perrin. We try not to camp very close to even
the smallest village, and not only because the villagers may
falsely accuse us of stealing whatever they have lost or of trying
to convince their children to find the Way. Where men have built
ten houses together, there is the potential for violence. Since the
Breaking the Tuatha&rsquo;an have known this. Safety lies in our wagons,
and in always moving, always seeking the song.&rdquo; A plaintive
expression came over his face. &ldquo;Everywhere we hear news of
violence, Perrin. Not just here in your Two Rivers. There is a feel
in the world of change, of destruction. Surely we must find the
song soon. Else I do not believe it will ever be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will find the song,&rdquo; Perrin said quietly. Maybe
they abhorred violence too much for a <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> to
overcome; maybe even a <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> could not fight the Way of
the Leaf. It had seemed attractive to him once, too. &ldquo;I truly hope
that you will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will be, will be,&rdquo; Raen said. &ldquo;All things die
in their time. Perhaps even the song.&rdquo; Ila put a comforting arm
around her husband, though her eyes were as troubled as his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said, trying to hide her ill ease, &ldquo;we
must get you inside. Men will talk if their coats are afire.&rdquo; To
Faile, she said, &ldquo;You are quite beautiful; child. Perhaps you
should beware of Perrin. I never see him but in the company of
beautiful girls.&rdquo; Faile gave Perrin a flat, considering look, then
tried to gloss it over quickly.</p>

<p>He made it as far as Raen&rsquo;s wagon&mdash;yellow
trimmed in red, with red and yellow spokes in tall, red-rimmed
wheels, and red and yellow trunks lashed to the outside, standing
beside a cook fire in the middle of the camp&mdash;but when he put
his foot on the first of the wooden steps at the back, his knees
gave way. Ihvon and Raen more than half-carried him inside,
followed hurriedly by Faile and Ila, and laid him on the bed built
into the front of the wagon, with just room to get by to the
sliding door leading to the driver&rsquo;s seat.</p>

<p>It truly was like a little house, even to pale pink
curtains at the two small windows on either side. He lay there
staring at the ceiling. Here, too, the Tinkers made use of their
colors; the ceiling was lacquered sky blue, the high cabinets green
and yellow. Faile unfastened his belt and took away his axe and
quiver while Ila rummaged in one of the cabinets. Perrin could not
seem to rouse any interest in what they were doing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyone can be surprised,&rdquo; Ihvon said. &ldquo;Learn from
it, but do not take it too much to heart. Not even Artur Hawkwing
won every battle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Artur Hawkwing.&rdquo; Perrin tried to laugh, but it
turned into a groan. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he managed. &ldquo;I am certainly not Artur
Hawkwing, am I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ila frowned at the Warder&mdash;or at his sword,
rather; she seemed to find that even worse than Perrin&rsquo;s axe&mdash;and came to the bed with a wad of folded bandages. Once she had
pulled Perrin&rsquo;s shirt away from the arrow stub, she winced. &ldquo;I do
not think I am competent to remove this. It is bedded deep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Barbed,&rdquo; Ihvon said in a conversational tone.
&ldquo;Trollocs do not use bows very often, but when they do the arrows
are barbed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out,&rdquo; the plump woman said firmly, rounding on him.
&ldquo;And you as well, Raen. Tending the sick is no business of men. Why
don&rsquo;t you go see if Moshea has that wheel on his wagon yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good idea,&rdquo; Raen said. &ldquo;We may want to move
tomorrow. There has been hard traveling this last year,&rdquo; he
confided to Perrin. &ldquo;All the way to Cairhien, then back again to
Ghealdan, then up into Andor. Tomorrow, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the red door shut behind him and Ihvon, Ila
turned to Faile worriedly. &ldquo;If it is barbed, I do not think I can
remove it at all. I will try if I must, but if there is anyone
nearby who knows more of such things&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is someone in Emond&rsquo;s Field,&rdquo; Faile assured
her. &ldquo;But is it safe to leave it in him until tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Safer than me cutting, perhaps. I can mix something
for him to drink for the pain, and blend a poultice against
infection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Glaring at the two women, Perrin said, &ldquo;Hello? Do you
remember me? I am right here. Stop trying to talk over my
head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They looked at him for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep him still,&rdquo; Ila told Faile. &ldquo;It is all right to
let him talk, but do not allow him to move about. He may injure
himself more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will see to it,&rdquo; Faile replied.</p>

<p>Perrin gritted his teeth and did his best to help in
getting his coat and shirt off, but they had to do most of the
work. He felt as weak as the worst wrought iron, ready to bend to
any pressure. Four inches of thumb-thick arrow stuck out almost
atop his last rib, rising from a puckered gash thick with dried
blood. They pushed his head down on a pillow, for some reason not
wanting him to look at it. Faile washed the wound while Ila
prepared her salve with a stone mortar and pestle&mdash;plain
smooth gray stone, the first things he had seen in the Tinker camp
that were not brightly colored. They mounded the salve around the
arrow and wrapped him with bandages to hold it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Raen and I will sleep beneath the wagon tonight,&rdquo;
the Tuatha&rsquo;an woman said at last, wiping her hands. Frowning at the
arrow stub sticking up from his bandages, she shook her head. &ldquo;Once
I thought he might eventually find the Way of the Leaf. He was a
gentle boy, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Way of the Leaf is not for everyone,&rdquo; Faile said
gently, but Ila shook her head again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is for everyone,&rdquo; she replied just as gently, and
a touch sadly, &ldquo;if they only knew it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She left then, and Faile sat on the edge of the bed
blotting his face with a folded cloth. He seemed to be sweating a
great deal for some reason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I blundered,&rdquo; he said after a time. &ldquo;No, that is too
soft. I don&rsquo;t know the right word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not blunder,&rdquo; she said firmly. &ldquo;You did what
seemed fitting at the time. It <em>was</em> fitting; I cannot
imagine how they got behind us. Gaul is not one to make a mistake
about where his enemies are. Ihvon was right, Perrin. Anyone can
find circumstances that have changed when he did not know. You held
everyone together. You brought us out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shook his head hard and made his side hurt worse.
&ldquo;Ihvon brought us out. What I did was get twenty-seven men killed,&rdquo;
he said bitterly, trying to sit up to face her. &ldquo;Some of them were
my friends, Faile. And I got them killed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faile threw her weight on his shoulders to push him
back down. It was a measure of his weakness, how easily she held
him. &ldquo;There will be time enough for that in the morning,&rdquo; she said
firmly, peering down into his face, &ldquo;when we have to put you back
on your horse. Ihvon did <em>not</em> bring us out; I do not think
he cared particularly if anyone but you and he did get out. Those
men would have scattered in every direction if not for you, and
then we&rsquo;d all have been hunted down. They would not have held
together for Ihvon, a stranger. As for your friends&mdash;&rdquo;
Sighing, she sat back down again. &ldquo;Perrin, my father says a general
can take care of the living or weep for the dead, but he cannot do
both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not a general, Faile. I am a fool of a
blacksmith who thought he could use other people to help him get
justice, or maybe revenge. I still want it, but I don&rsquo;t want to use
anyone else for it any longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think the Trollocs will go away because you
decide your motives are not pure enough?&rdquo; The heat in her voice
made him raise his head, but she pushed it back to the pillow
almost roughly. &ldquo;Are they any less vile? Do you need a purer reason
to fight them than what they are? Another thing my father says. The
worst sin a general can commit, worse than blundering, worse than
losing, worse than anything, is to desert the men who depend on
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A tap came at the door, and a slender, handsome young
Tinker in a red-and-green striped coat put his head in. He flashed
a smile at Faile, all white teeth and oozing charm, before looking
at Perrin. &ldquo;Grandfather said it was you. I thought this was where
Egwene said she came from.&rdquo; He frowned suddenly, disapprovingly.
&ldquo;Your eyes. I see you have followed Elyas after all, to run with
the wolves. I was sure you would never find the Way of the
Leaf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin knew him; Aram, Raen and Ila&rsquo;s grandson. He
did not like him; he smiled like Wil. &ldquo;Go away, Aram. I am
tired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Egwene with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egwene&rsquo;s Aes Sedai now, Aram,&rdquo; he growled, &ldquo;and she
would rip your heart out with the One Power if you asked her to
dance. Go away!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aram blinked, and hastily shut the door. With himself
outside.</p>

<p>Perrin let his head fall back. &ldquo;He smiles too much,&rdquo;
he muttered. &ldquo;I cannot abide a man who smiles too much.&rdquo; Faile made
a choking noise, and he looked at her suspiciously. She was biting
her underlip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have something in my throat,&rdquo; she said in a
strangled voice, getting up hastily. She hurried to the wide shelf
below the foot of the bed where Ila had prepared her poultice and
stood with her back to him, pouring water from a green-and-red
pitcher into a blue-and-yellow mug. &ldquo;Would you like something to
drink, too? Ila left this powder, for the pain. It will help you
sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any powder,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Faile, who is
your father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her back went very stiff. After a moment she turned
with the mug in both hands and an unreadable look in her tilted
eyes. Another minute passed before she said, &ldquo;My father is Davram
of House Bashere, Lord of Bashere, Tyr and Sidona, Guardian of the
Blightborder, Defender of the Heartland, Marshal-General to Queen
Tenobia of Saldaea. And her uncle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light! What was all that about him being a wood
merchant, or a fur dealer? I seem to remember him dealing in ice
peppers once, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not a lie,&rdquo; she said sharply, then in a
weaker voice, &ldquo;Just not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the whole truth. My father&rsquo;s estates
do produce lumber and fine woods, and ice peppers, and furs, and
more besides. And his stewards sell them for him, so he does trade
in them. In a way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t you just tell me? Hiding things. Lying.
You&rsquo;re a lady!&rdquo; He frowned at her accusingly. He had not expected
this. A small merchant for a father, a former soldier, maybe, but
not this. &ldquo;Light, what are you doing running around as a Hunter of
the Horn? Don&rsquo;t tell me the Lord of Bashere and all that just sent
you off to find adventure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still holding the cup, she came back to sit beside
him. For some reason she seemed very intent on his face. &ldquo;My two
older brothers died, Perrin, one fighting Trollocs, the other in a
fall from his horse hunting. That made me the eldest, and it meant
I had to study account books and trading. While my younger brothers
learned to be soldiers, while they were being readied for
adventures, I had to learn how to manage the estates! It is the
eldest&rsquo;s duty. Duty! It is dull, dry and boring. Buried in paper
and clerks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When Father took Maedin with him to the Blightborder&mdash;he&rsquo;s two years younger than I&mdash;that was more than I
could stand. Girls are not taught the sword, or war, in Saldaea,
but father had named an old soldier from his first command as my
footman, and Eran was always more than happy to teach me to use
knives and fight with my hands. I think it amused him. In any case,
when Father took Maedin with him, the news had arrived calling the
Great Hunt of the Horn, so I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;left. I wrote Mother a letter
explaining, and I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;left. And I reached Illian in time to take
the oath of a Hunter&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Picking up the cloth, she patted at the
sweat on his face again. &ldquo;You really should sleep if you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you are the Lady Bashere or some such?&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;How did you ever come to like a common blacksmith?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The word is &lsquo;love,&rsquo; Perrin Aybara.&rdquo; The firmness of
her voice was at sharp odds with the gentle way that the cloth
moved on his face. &ldquo;And you are not such a common blacksmith, I
think.&rdquo; The cloth paused. &ldquo;Perrin, what did that fellow mean about
running with wolves? Raen mentioned this Elyas, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment he was frozen, unbreathing. Yet he had
just berated her for keeping secrets from him. It was what he got
for being hasty and angry. Swing a hammer in haste, and you usually
hit your own thumb. He exhaled slowly, and told her. How he had met
Elyas Machera and learned he could talk to wolves. How his eyes had
changed color, grown sharper, and his hearing and his sense of
smell, like a wolf&rsquo;s. About the wolf dream. About what would happen
to him, if he ever lost his hold on humanity. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so easy.
Sometimes, especially in the dream, I forget I&rsquo;m a man, not a wolf.
If one of these times I don&rsquo;t remember quickly enough, if I lose
hold, I&rsquo;ll <em>be</em> a wolf. In my head, at least. A sort of
half-wrong image of a wolf. There won&rsquo;t be anything of <em>me</em>
left.&rdquo; He stopped, waiting for her to flinch, to move away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If your ears are really that sharp,&rdquo; she said
calmly, &ldquo;I will have to watch what I say close to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He caught her hand to stop her patting. &ldquo;Did you hear
anything I said? What will your father and mother think, Faile? A
half-wolf blacksmith. You&rsquo;re a lady! Light!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard every word. Father will approve. He has
always said our family blood is growing too soft; not like it was
in the old days. I know he thinks I am terribly soft.&rdquo; She gave him
a smile fierce enough for any wolf. &ldquo;Of course, Mother always
wanted me to marry a king who splits Trollocs in two with one
stroke of his sword. I suppose your axe will suffice, but could you
tell her you are the king of the wolves? I don&rsquo;t think anyone will
come forward to dispute your claim to that throne. In truth, the
splitting of Trollocs will probably do for Mother, but I truly
think she would like the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light!&rdquo; he said hoarsely. She sounded almost
serious. No, she did sound serious. If she was even <em>half</em>
serious, he was not sure the Trollocs might not be better than
meeting her parents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she said, holding the mug of water to his
lips. &ldquo;You sound as though your throat is dry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Swallowing, he spluttered at the bitter taste. She
had stirred in Ila&rsquo;s powder! He tried to stop, but she filled his
mouth, and it was a matter of swallow or choke. By the time he
could push the mug away, she had emptied half of it into him. Why
did medicine always taste so vile? He suspected women did it on
purpose. He would have bet that whatever they took for themselves
did not taste that way. &ldquo;I told you I did not want any of that.
Gaaah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you? I must not have heard. But whether you did
or not, you need sleep.&rdquo; She stroked his curly hair. &ldquo;Sleep, my
Perrin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He tried to tell her he had indeed told her so, and
she had heard it, but the words seemed to tangle around his tongue.
His eyes wanted to slide shut. In fact, he could not keep them
open. The last thing he heard was her soft murmurs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sleep, my wolf king. Sleep.&rdquo;</p>
