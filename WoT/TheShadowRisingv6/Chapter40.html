<h4><em>Hunter of Trollocs</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">R</span>emnants
of the early-morning rain still dripped from
the leaves of the apple trees, and a purple finch hopped along a
limb where fruit was forming that would not be harvested this year.
The sun was well up, but hidden behind thick gray clouds. Seated
cross-legged on the ground, Perrin unconsciously tested his
bowstring; the tightly wrapped, waxed cords had a tendency to go
slack in wet weather. The storm Verin had called up to hide them
from pursuit the night of the rescue had surprised even her with
its ferocity, and beating rains had come three more times in the
six days since. He believed it was six days. He had not really
thought since that night, only drifted as events took him, reacting
to what presented itself. The flat of his axe blade dug into his
side, but he hardly noticed.</p>

<p>Low, grassy mounds marked generations of Aybaras
buried here. The oldest among the carved wooden headpieces, cracked
and barely legible, bore dates nearly three hundred years old, over
graves indistinguishable from undisturbed ground. It was the mounds
smoothed by rains but barely covered by grass that stabbed him.
Generations of Aybaras buried here, but surely never fourteen at
one time. Aunt Neain over by Uncle Carlin&rsquo;s older grave, with their
two children beside her. Great Aunt Ealsin in the row with Uncle
Eward and Aunt Magde and their three children, the long row with
his mother and his father, Adora and Deselle and little Paet. A
long row of mounds with bare, wet earth still showing through the
grass. He counted the arrows remaining in his quiver by touch.
Seventeen. Too many had been damaged, worth recovering only for the
steel arrowheads. No time to make his own; he would have to see the
fletcher in Emond&rsquo;s Field soon. Buel Dowtry made good arrows, even
better than Tam.</p>

<p>A faint rustle behind his back made him sniff the
air. &ldquo;What is it, Dannil?&rdquo; he said without looking around.</p>

<p>There was a catch of breath, a moment of startled
surprise, before Dannil Lewin said, &ldquo;The Lady is here, Perrin.&rdquo;
None of them had gotten used to him knowing who was who before he
saw them, or in the dark, but he no longer really cared what they
found strange.</p>

<p>He frowned over his shoulder. Dannil looked leaner
than he had; farmers could only feed so many at once, and food had
been feast or famine as the hunting went. Mostly famine. &ldquo;The
Lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Lady Faile. And Lord Luc, too. They came from
Emond&rsquo;s Field.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin rose smoothly, taking long strides that made
Dannil hurry to keep up. He managed not to look at the house. The
charred timbers and sooty chimneys that had been the house where he
grew up. He did scan the trees for his lookouts, those nearest the
farm. Close to the Waterwood as it was, the land held plenty of
tall oak and hemlock, and good-sized ash and bay. Thick foliage hid
the lads well&mdash;drab farm clothes made for good hiding&mdash;so even he had difficulty picking them out. He would have to talk
with those farther out; they were supposed to see that no one came
close without a warning. Even Faile and this Luc.</p>

<p>The camp, in a large thicket where he had once
pretended to be in a far wilderness, was a rough place among the
undergrowth, with blankets strung between trees to make shelters,
and more scattered on the ground between the small cook fires. The
branches dripped here, too. Most of the nearly fifty men in the
camp, all young, were unshaven, either in imitation of Perrin or
because it was unpleasant shaving in cold water. They were good
hunters&mdash;he had sent home any who were not&mdash;but
unaccustomed to more than a night or two outdoors at a time. And
not used to what he had them doing, either.</p>

<p>Right then they were standing around gaping at Faile
and Luc, and only four or five had longbow in hand. The rest of the
bows lay with the bedding, and the quivers, too, more often than
not. Luc stood idly flipping the reins of a tall black stallion,
the very pose of indolent, red-coated arrogance, cold blue eyes
ignoring the men around him. The man&rsquo;s smell stood out among the
others, cold and separate, too, almost as if he had nothing in
common with the men around him, not even humanity.</p>

<p>Faile came hurrying to meet Perrin with a smile, her
narrow divided skirts making a soft <em>whisk-whisk</em> as gray
silk brushed silk. She smelled faintly of sweet herbal soap, and of
herself. &ldquo;Master Luhhan said we might find you here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He meant to demand what she was doing there, but
found himself putting his arms around her and saying into her hair,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to see you. I have missed you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She pushed back enough to look up at him. &ldquo;You look
tired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He ignored that; he had no time to be tired. &ldquo;You got
everyone safely to Emond&rsquo;s Field?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are at the Winespring Inn.&rdquo; She grinned
suddenly. &ldquo;Master al&rsquo;Vere found an old halberd and says if the
Whitecloaks want them, they will have to go through him. Everyone&rsquo;s
in the village now, Perrin. Verin and Alanna, the Warders.
Pretending to be someone else, of course. And Loial. He certainly
created a sensation. Even more than Bain and Chiad.&rdquo; The grin faded
into a frown. &ldquo;He asked me to deliver a message to you. Alanna
vanished twice without a word, once alone. Loial said Ihvon seemed
surprised to find her gone. He said I wasn&rsquo;t to let anyone else
know.&rdquo; She studied his face. &ldquo;What does it mean, Perrin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, maybe. Just that I can&rsquo;t be sure I can
trust her. Verin warned me against her, but can I trust Verin? You
say Bain and Chiad are in Emond&rsquo;s Field? I suppose that means he
knows about them.&rdquo; He jerked his head toward Luc. A few of the men
had approached him, asking diffident questions, and he was
answering with a condescending smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They came with us,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;They are
scouting around your camp now. I do not think they have a very high
opinion of your sentries. Perrin, why don&rsquo;t you want Luc to know
about the Aiel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve talked to a number of people who were burned
out.&rdquo; Luc was too far to overhear, but he held his voice low.
&ldquo;Counting Flann Lewin&rsquo;s place, Luc was at five on the day they were
attacked, or the day before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perrin, the man&rsquo;s an arrogant fool in some ways&mdash;I hear he&rsquo;s hinted at a claim to one of the Borderland
thrones, for all he told us he&rsquo;s from Murandy&mdash;but you cannot
really believe he is a Darkfriend. He gave some very good advice in
Emond&rsquo;s Field. When I said everyone was there, I meant everyone.&rdquo;
She shook her dark head wonderingly. &ldquo;Hundreds and hundreds of
people have come in from north and south, from every direction,
with their cattle and their sheep, all talking of Perrin
Goldeneyes&rsquo;s warnings. Your little village is preparing to defend
itself if need be, and Luc has been everywhere the last days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perrin who?&rdquo; he gasped, wincing. Trying to change
the subject, he said, &ldquo;From the south? But this is as far south as
I&rsquo;ve gone. I haven&rsquo;t talked to a farmer more than a mile below the
Winespring Water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faile tugged at his beard with a laugh. &ldquo;News
spreads, my fine general. I think half of them expect you to form
them into an army and chase the Trollocs all the way back to the
Great Blight. There will be stories about you in the Two Rivers for
the next thousand years. Perrin Goldeneyes, hunter of
Trollocs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light!&rdquo; he muttered.</p>

<p>Hunter of Trollocs. There had been little so far to
justify that. Two days after freeing Mistress Luhhan and the
others, the day after Verin and Tomas rode on their own way, they
had come on the still-smoking ruins of a farmhouse, he and the
fifteen Two Rivers lads with him then. After burying what they
found in the ashes, it was easy enough to follow the Trollocs,
between Gaul&rsquo;s tracking and his own nose. The sharp fetid stink of
the Trollocs had not had time to fade away, not to him. Some of the
lads had grown hesitant when they realized he meant what he had
said about hunting Trollocs. If they had had to go very far, he
suspected most would have drifted away when no one was looking, but
the trail led to a thicket no more than three miles off. The
Trollocs had not bothered with sentries&mdash;they had no
Myrddraal with them to overawe their laziness&mdash;and the Two
Rivers men knew how to stalk silently. Thirty-two Trollocs died,
many in their filthy blankets, pierced through with arrows before
they could raise a howl, much less sword or axe. Dannil and Ban and
the others had been ready to celebrate a great triumph&mdash;until
they found what was in the Trollocs&rsquo; big iron cookpot sitting in
the ashes of the fire. Most dashed away to throw up, and more than
one wept openly. Perrin dug the grave himself. Only one: there was
no way to tell what had belonged to whom. Cold as he felt inside,
he was not sure he could have stood it himself if there had
been.</p>

<p>Late the next day no one hesitated when he picked up
another fetid trail, though a few mutters wondered what he was
following, until Gaul found the tracks of hooves and boots too big
for men. Another thicket, close to the Waterwood, held forty-one
Trollocs and a Fade, with sentries set, though most snored at their
posts. It would have made no difference had they all been awake.
Gaul killed those that were, sliding through the trees like a
shadow, and the Two Rivers men were nearly thirty themselves by
then. Besides, those who had not seen the cookpot had heard of it;
they shouted as they shot, with a satisfaction not much less savage
than the guttural Trolloc howls. The black-garbed Myrddraal had
been last to die, a porcupine quilled with arrows. No one cared to
recover a shaft from that, even after it finally stopped
thrashing.</p>

<p>That evening the second rain came, hours of drenching
downpour with a sky full of roiling black clouds and stabbing
lightning. Perrin had not smelled Trolloc scent since, and the
ground had been washed clean of tracks. Most of their time had been
spent avoiding Whitecloak patrols, which everyone said were more
numerous than in the past. The farmers Perrin had spoken to said
the patrols seemed more interested in finding their prisoners again
and those who had broken them free than in looking for
Trollocs.</p>

<p>Quite a few of the men had gathered around Luc now.
He was tall enough for his red-gold hair to show above their darker
heads. He seemed to be talking, and they listening. And
nodding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what he has to say,&rdquo; Perrin said
grimly.</p>

<p>The Two Rivers men gave way before Faile and him with
only a little prodding. They were all intent on the red-coated
lord, who was indeed holding forth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;so the village is quite secure, now. Plenty of
people gathered together to defend it. I must say I enjoy sleeping
under a roof when I can. Mistress al&rsquo;Vere, at the inn, provides a
tasty meal. Her bread is among the best I have ever eaten. There
truly is nothing like fresh-baked bread and fresh-churned butter,
and putting your feet up of an evening with a fine mug of wine, or
some of Master al&rsquo;Vere&rsquo;s good brown ale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord Luc was saying we should go to Emond&rsquo;s Field,
Perrin,&rdquo; Kenley Ahan said, scrubbing his reddened nose with the
back of a grimy hand. He was not the only one who had been unable
to wash as often as he would like, and not the only one coming down
with a cold, either.</p>

<p>Luc smiled at Perrin much the way he would have at a
dog he expected to see do a trick. &ldquo;The village <em>is</em> quite
secure, but there is always a need for more strong backs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are hunting Trollocs,&rdquo; Perrin said coolly. &ldquo;Not
everyone has left their farms yet, and every band we find and kill
means farms not burned and more people with a chance to reach
safety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wil al&rsquo;Seen barked a laugh. He was not so pretty with
a red puffy nose and a spotty, six-day growth of beard. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve not
<em>smelled</em> a Trolloc in days. Be reasonable, Perrin. Maybe
we&rsquo;ve killed them all already.&rdquo; There were mutters of
agreement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not mean to spread dissension.&rdquo; Luc spread his
hands guilelessly. &ldquo;No doubt you have had many great successes
beside those we have heard of. Hundreds of Trollocs killed, I
expect. You may well have chased them all away. I can tell you,
Emond&rsquo;s Field is ready to give you all a hero&rsquo;s welcome. The same
must be true at Watch Hill for those who live up that way. Any
Deven Riders?&rdquo; Wil nodded, and Luc clapped him on the shoulder with
a hollow good fellowship. &ldquo;A hero&rsquo;s welcome, without a doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyone who wants to go home, can,&rdquo; Perrin said in a
level voice. Faile directed a warning frown at him; this was no way
to be a general. But he did not want anyone with him who did not
want to be there. He did not want to be a general, for that matter.
&ldquo;Myself, I don&rsquo;t think the job is done yet, but it is your
choice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one took him up, though Wil at least looked ready
to, but twenty more stared at the ground and scuffed their boots in
last year&rsquo;s leaves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Luc said casually, &ldquo;if you have no Trollocs
left to chase, perhaps it is time to turn your attentions to the
Whitecloaks. They are not happy at you Two Rivers folk deciding to
defend yourselves. And I understand they meant to hang the lot of
you in particular, as outlaws, for stealing their prisoners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anxious frowns passed between a good many of the Two
Rivers lads.</p>

<p>It was then that Gaul came pushing through the crowd,
followed close by Bain and Chiad. Not that the Aiel had to push, of
course; the men cleared aside as soon as they realized who it was.
Luc frowned at Gaul thoughtfully, perhaps disapprovingly; the
Aielman stared back stony-faced. Wil and Dannil and the others
brightened at sight of the Aiel; most still believed hundreds more
were hiding somewhere in the thickets and forests. They never
questioned why all those Aiel stayed hidden, and Perrin certainly
never brought it up. If believing in a few hundred Aiel
reinforcements helped them keep their courage, well and good.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you find?&rdquo; Perrin asked. Gaul had been gone
since the day before; he could move as fast as a man on horseback,
faster in woods, and he could see more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trollocs,&rdquo; Gaul replied as though reporting the
presence of sheep, &ldquo;moving up through this well-named Waterwood to
the south. They number no more than thirty, and I believe they mean
to make camp on the edge of the forest and strike tonight. There
are men still holding to the soil to the south.&rdquo; He gave a sudden,
wolfish grin. &ldquo;They did not see me. They will have no warning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chiad leaned closer to Bain. &ldquo;He moves well enough,
for a Stone Dog,&rdquo; she whispered loudly enough to be heard twenty
feet off. &ldquo;He makes little more noise than a lame bull.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Wil?&rdquo; Perrin said. &ldquo;Do you want to go to
Emond&rsquo;s Field? You can shave, and maybe find a girl to kiss while
these Trollocs have supper tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wil flushed a dark red. &ldquo;I will be wherever you are
tonight, Aybara,&rdquo; he said in a hard voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody means to go home if there are Trollocs still
about, Perrin,&rdquo; Kenley added.</p>

<p>Perrin looked around at the others, meeting only
agreeing nods. &ldquo;What of you, Luc? We would be pleased to have a
lord and Hunter for the Horn with us. You could show us how it is
done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Luc smiled fractionally, a gash on stone that never
came close to those cold blue eyes. &ldquo;I regret the defenses of
Emond&rsquo;s Field still need me. I must see to protecting your people,
should the Trollocs come there in greater numbers than thirty. Or
the Children of the Light. My Lady Faile?&rdquo; He held out a hand to
assist her in mounting, but she shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will remain with Perrin, Lord Luc.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pity,&rdquo; he murmured, shrugging as if to say there
was no accounting for women&rsquo;s taste. Tugging on his
wolf-embroidered gauntlets, he swung into the black stallion&rsquo;s
saddle smoothly. &ldquo;Good luck to you, Master Goldeneyes. I do hope
you all have good luck.&rdquo; With a half-bow to Faile, he whirled his
tall horse showily and spurred him to a gallop that forced some of
the men to leap out of his way.</p>

<p>Faile frowned at Perrin in a manner that suggested a
lecture on rudeness when they were alone. He listened to Luc&rsquo;s
horse until he could hear it no more, then turned to Gaul. &ldquo;Can we
get ahead of the Trollocs? Be waiting somewhere before they reach
wherever they mean to stop?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The distances are right if we start now,&rdquo; Gaul said.
&ldquo;They are moving in a straight line, and not hurrying. There is a
Nightrunner with them. It will be easier surprising them in their
blankets than facing them awake.&rdquo; He meant that the Two Rivers men
might do better; there was no fear smell on him.</p>

<p>There was certainly fear smell on some of the others,
yet no one suggested that a confrontation with Trollocs up and
alert, and a Myrddraal to boot, might not be the best plan. They
broke camp as soon as he gave the order, dousing the fires and
scattering the ashes, gathering their few pots and mounting their
ill-assorted horses and ponies. With the sentries in&mdash;Perrin
reminded himself to have that word with them&mdash;they numbered nearly
seventy. Surely enough to ambush thirty Trollocs. Ban al&rsquo;Seen and
Dannil each still led half&mdash;it seemed the way to keep arguments
down&mdash;with Bili al&rsquo;Dai and Kenley and others each heading ten or so.
Wil, too; he was not too bad a fellow usually, when he could keep
his mind off the girls.</p>

<p>Faile rode Swallow close beside Stepper as they
started south with the Aiel running ahead. &ldquo;You truly do not trust
him at all,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You think he is a Darkfriend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I trust you and my bow and my axe,&rdquo; he told her. Her
face looked sad and pleased at the same time, but it was the simple
truth.</p>

<p>For two hours Gaul led them south before turning into
the Waterwood, a tangle of towering oak and pine and leatherleaf,
bushy bay trees and cone-shaped redoil trees, tall round-topped ash
and sweetberry and black willow, with thickets of vine-woven brush
below. A thousand squirrels chittered on the branches, and thrushes
and finches and redwings darted everywhere. Perrin smelled deer and
rabbits, too, and foxes. Tiny streams abounded, and rush-bordered
pools and ponds dotted the forest, often shaded but sometimes open,
from less than ten paces across to a few almost fifty. The ground
seemed sodden after all the rain it had received, squelching under
the horses&rsquo; hooves.</p>

<p>Between a large, willow-ringed pond and a narrow
rivulet a pace wide, perhaps two miles into the wood, Gaul halted.
Here the Trollocs would come if they continued as they had been.
The three Aiel melted into the trees to make sure of that, and
bring back warning of their approach.</p>

<p>Leaving Faile and a dozen men to watch the horses,
Perrin spread the others out in a narrow curve, a cup into which
the Trollocs should march. After making certain each man was well
hidden and knew what he was to do, he placed himself at the bottom
of the cup, beside an oak with a trunk thicker than he was
tall.</p>

<p>Easing his axe in its belt loop, he nocked an arrow
and waited. A light breeze blew in his face, swelling and falling.
He should be able to smell the Trollocs long before they came in
sight. They should be coming right at him. Touching the axe again,
he waited. Minutes passed. An hour. More. How long before the
Shadowspawn appeared? Much longer in this damp and bowstrings would
need to be changed.</p>

<p>The birds vanished a moment before the squirrels went
silent. Perrin drew a deep breath, and frowned. Nothing. On that
breeze he should surely be able to smell Trollocs as soon as the
animals sensed them.</p>

<p>A vagrant gust brought him the putrid stink, like
centuries-old sweat and rot. Whirling, he shouted, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re behind
us! Rally to me! Two Rivers to me!&rdquo; Behind. The horses. &ldquo;Faile!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Screams and shouts erupted from every side, howls and
savage cries. A ram-horned Trolloc leaped into the open twenty
paces away, raising a long curved bow. Perrin drew fletchings to
ear and fired in one smooth motion, reaching for another shaft as
soon as his arrow cleared bow. His broadhead point took the Trolloc
between its eyes; it bellowed once as it fell. And its arrow, the
size of a small spear, took Perrin in the side like a
hammerblow.</p>

<p>Gasping with shock, he hunched over, dropping bow and
fresh arrow alike. Pain spread out in sheets from the
black-fletched shaft; it quivered when he drew breath, and every
quiver shot out new pain.</p>

<p>Two more Trollocs leaped over their dead companion,
wolf snout and goat horns, black-mailed shapes half again as tall
as Perrin and twice as broad. Baying, they rushed at him, curved
swords upraised.</p>

<p>Forcing himself upright, he gritted his teeth and
snapped the thumb-thick arrow off short, pulled his axe free and
rushed to meet them. Howling, he realized dimly. Howling with rage
that filmed his eyes red. They towered over him, their armor all
spikes at elbows and shoulders, but he swung his axe in a frenzy,
as if trying to cut down a tree with every blow. For Adora. For
Deselle. &ldquo;My mother!&rdquo; he screamed. &ldquo;Burn you! My mother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly he realized he was hacking at bloody shapes
on the ground. Growling, he made himself stop, shaking with the
effort as much as with the pain in his side. There was less
shouting now. Fewer screams. Was anyone left but him? &ldquo;Rally to me!
Two Rivers to me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two Rivers!&rdquo; someone shouted frantically, off
through the damp woods, and then another, &ldquo;Two Rivers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two. Only two. &ldquo;Faile!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Oh, Light,
Faile!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A flicker of black flowing through the trees
announced a Myrddraal before he could see it clearly, snakelike
black armor down its chest, inky cloak hanging undisturbed by its
running. As it came closer, it slowed to a sinuous, assured walk;
it knew he was hurt, knew him for easy meat. Its pale-faced,
eyeless stare stabbed him with fear. &ldquo;Faile?&rdquo; it said mockingly.
Its voice made the name sound like burned leather crumbling. &ldquo;Your
Faile was delicious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roaring, Perrin hurled himself at it. A black-bladed
sword turned his first stroke. And his second. His third. The
thing&rsquo;s slug-white face became fixed with concentration, but it
moved like a viper, like lightning. For the moment he had it on the
defensive. For the moment. Blood trickled down his side; his side
burned like a forge-fire. He could not keep this up. And when his
strength failed, that sword would find his heart.</p>

<p>His foot slipped in the mud churned up beneath his
boots, the Fade&rsquo;s blade drew back&mdash;and a blurring sword
half-severed the eyeless head, so it fell over on one shoulder in a
fountain of black blood. Stabbing blindly, the Myrddraal staggered
forward, stumbling, refusing to die completely, still instinctively
trying to kill.</p>

<p>Perrin scrambled out of its path, but his attention
was all for the man coolly wiping his blade with a fistful of
leaves. Ihvon&rsquo;s color-shifting cloak hung down his back. &ldquo;Alanna
sent me to find you. I almost didn&rsquo;t, the way you have been moving,
but seventy horses do leave tracks.&rdquo; The dark, slender Warder
seemed as composed as if he were lighting his pipe before a
fireplace. &ldquo;The Trollocs were not linked to that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He
indicated the Myrddraal with his sword; it had fallen, but still
stabbed randomly. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;more&rsquo;s the pity, but if you can gather
your people together, they might not be willing to try you without
one of the Faceless to goad them. I would estimate about a hundred,
to begin. A few less, now. You have bloodied them some.&rdquo; He began a
calm survey of the shadows beneath the trees, only the blade in his
hand indicating anything out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>For a bare moment Perrin gaped. Alanna wanted him?
She had sent Ihvon? Just in time to save his life. Shaking himself,
he raised his voice again. &ldquo;Two Rivers to me! For the love of the
Light, rally to me! Here! Rally! Here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This time he kept it up until familiar faces
appeared, stumbling through the trees. Blood-streaked faces, often
as not. Shocked, staring faces. Some men half-supported others, and
some had lost their bows. The Aiel were among them, apparently
unhurt except that Gaul limped slightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They did not come as we expected&rdquo; was all the
Aielman said. The night was colder than we expected. There was more
rain than we expected. That was how he said it.</p>

<p>Faile seemed to materialize with the horses. With
half the horses, including Stepper and Swallow, and nine of the
twelve men he had left with her. A scrape marred one cheek, but she
was alive. He tried to hug her, but she pushed his arms away,
muttering angrily over the broken-off arrow even while she gently
pulled his coat away from the thick shaft in an effort to examine
where it had gone in.</p>

<p>Perrin studied the men around him. They had stopped
coming now, yet there were faces missing. Kenley Ahan. Bili al&rsquo;Dai.
Teven Marwin. He made himself name the missing, made himself count
them. Twenty-seven. Twenty-seven not there. &ldquo;Did you bring all the
wounded?&rdquo; he asked dully. &ldquo;Is anybody left out there?&rdquo; Faile&rsquo;s hand
trembled on his side; her expression as she frowned at his wound
was a blend of worry and fury. She had a right to be angry. He
should never have gotten her into this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only the dead,&rdquo; Ban al&rsquo;Seen said in a voice as
leaden as his face.</p>

<p>Wil looked to be frowning at something just out of
sight. &ldquo;I saw Kenley,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;His head was in the crook of an
oak, but the rest of him was down at the foot. I saw him. His cold
won&rsquo;t bother him now.&rdquo; He sneezed, and looked startled.</p>

<p>Perrin sighed heavily, and wished he had not; pain
shooting up his side clenched his teeth. Faile, a green-and-gold
silk scarf wadded in her hand, was trying to pull his shirt out of
his breeches. He pushed her hands away despite her scowl; there was
no time for tending wounds now. &ldquo;Wounded on the horses,&rdquo; he said
when he could speak. &ldquo;Ihvon, will they attack us?&rdquo; The forest
seemed too still. &ldquo;Ihvon?&rdquo; The Warder appeared, leading a dark gray
gelding with a fierce eye. Perrin repeated his question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. Perhaps not. On their own, Trollocs kill
whomever is easiest. Without a Halfman, they would probably rather
find a farm than someone who might put arrows in them. Make sure
everyone who can stand upright carries a bow with an arrow nocked
even if they cannot draw it. They may decide the price is too high
for the fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin shivered. If the Trollocs did attack, they
would have as much fun as a dance at Sunday. Ihvon and the Aiel
were the only ones really ready to fight back. And Faile; her dark
eyes shone with fury. He had to get her to safety.</p>

<p>The Warder did not offer his own horse for the
wounded, which made sense. The animal was not likely to let anyone
else on its back, and a war-trained horse with its master in the
saddle would be a formidable weapon if the Trollocs came again.
Perrin tried to put Faile up on Swallow, but she stopped him. &ldquo;The
wounded, you said,&rdquo; she told him softly. &ldquo;Remember?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To his disgust, she insisted he ride Stepper. He
expected the others to protest, after he had brought them to
disaster, but no one did. There were just enough horses for those
who could not walk, and those unable to walk far&mdash;grudgingly
he admitted that he was one of the latter&mdash;so he ended up in
his saddle. Half the other riders had to cling to theirs. He sat
upright, gritting his teeth to do it.</p>

<p>Those who walked or stumbled, and some who rode,
clutched their bows as if they meant salvation. Perrin carried one,
too, and so did Faile, though he doubted she could even draw a Two
Rivers longbow. It was appearance that counted now; illusion that
might see them safe. Like Ihvon, alert as a coiled whip; the three
Aiel looked unchanged as they glided ahead, spears stuck through
the harness of the bow cases on their backs, horn bows in hand and
ready. The rest, including himself, were a ragbag remnant, nothing
like the band he had led here, so confident and full of his own
pride. Yet illusion worked as well as reality. For the first mile
through the tangle vagrant breezes brought him Trolloc stink, the
scent of Trollocs shadowing, stalking. Then the stench slowly faded
and vanished as the Trollocs fell behind, deluded by a mirage.</p>

<p>Faile walked beside Stepper, one hand on Perrin&rsquo;s leg
as though she meant to hold him up. Now and then she looked up at
him, smiling encouragingly, but with worry creasing her forehead.
He smiled back as best he could, trying to make her think he was
all right. Twenty-seven. He could not stop the names from running
through his head. Colly Garren and Jared Aydaer, Dael al&rsquo;Taron and
Ken Chandin. Twenty-seven Two Rivers folk he had killed with his
stupidity. Twenty-seven.</p>

<p>They took the most direct route back out of the
Waterwood, breaking clear sometime in the afternoon. It was hard to
tell exactly how late with the sky still blanketed in gray and
everything blandly shadowed. High-grass pasture dotted with trees
stretched in front of them, and some scattered sheep, and a few
farmhouses in the distance. No smoke rose from any of the chimneys;
if there was anyone in those houses, something hot would have been
cooking in the fireplace. The nearest rising smoke plume looked
five miles off at least.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We should find a farm for the night,&rdquo; Ihvon said.
&ldquo;Some place under cover in case it rains again. A fire. Food.&rdquo; He
looked at the Two Rivers men and added, &ldquo;Water and bandages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin only nodded. The Warder was better than he at
knowing the right thing to do. Old Bili Congar with his head full
of ale was probably better. He just let Stepper follow Ihvon&rsquo;s
gray.</p>

<p>Before they had gone much beyond a mile, a faint
thread of music caught Perrin&rsquo;s ear, fiddles and flutes playing
merry tunes. At first he thought he was dreaming, but then the
others heard, too, exchanging incredulous looks, then relieved
grins. Music meant people, and happy people by the sound, someone
celebrating. That anyone might have something to celebrate was
enough to pick their feet up somewhat.</p>
