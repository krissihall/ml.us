<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
Aiel broke camp early and were away from Rhuidean
while the not-yet-risen sun still sharply silhouetted the far
mountains. In three parties they wound around Chaendaer, down onto
rough flats broken by hills and tall stone spires and flat-topped
buttes, gray and brown and every hue between, some streaked with
long swirls in shades of red and ocher. Occasionally a great
natural arch loomed as they moved north and west, or strange, huge
slabs of rock balanced improbably, forever on the brink of falling.
Every way Rand looked, jagged mountains reared in the distance. All
the wreckage of the Breaking of the World seemed gathered here in
the place called the Aiel Waste. Where the hard ground was not
cracked clay, yellow or brown or something between, it was stony
and stark, and everywhere split by dry gulleys and hollows. The
scattered vegetation was sparse and low, thorny bushes and leafless
things with spines; the few blossoms, white, or red, or yellow, were
startling in their isolation. Occasionally stretches of tough grass
covered the ground, and rarely, there was a stunted tree also
likely to have thorns or spines. Compared to Chaendaer and the
valley of Rhuidean, it almost looked lush. The air was so clear,
the land so barren, it seemed Rand could see for miles and
miles.</p>

<p>That air was no less dry, though, the heat no less
relentless, with the sun a lump of molten gold high in a cloudless
sky. Rand had wrapped a <em>shoufa</em> around his head in an
effort to keep the sun off, and drank from the waterbag on
Jeade&rsquo;en&rsquo;s saddle frequently. Oddly, wearing his coat seemed to
help; he did not sweat any less, but his shirt stayed damp beneath
the red wool, cooling him somewhat. Mat used a strip of cloth to
tie a large white kerchief atop his head, like some odd cap that
hung down the back of his neck, and he kept shading his eyes
against the glare. He carried the raven-marked sword-spear like a
lance, the butt tucked into his stirrup.</p>

<p>Four hundred or so Jindo comprised their party; Rand
and Mat rode at the front alongside Rhuarc and Heirn. The Aiel
walked, of course, their tents and some of the booty from Tear on
pack mules and horses. A number of the Jindo Maidens fanned ahead
as scouts, and Stone Dogs trailed behind as a rear guard, with the
main column hedged by watchful eyes, ready spears, and bows with
arrows nocked. Supposedly the Peace of Rhuidean extended until
those who had gone to Chaendaer returned to their own holds, but as
Rhuarc explained to Rand, mistakes had been known to happen, and
apologies and bloodprice did not bring the dead out of their
graves. Rhuarc seemed to think a mistake especially likely this
time, certainly in part because of the Shaido party.</p>

<p>The lands of the Shaido clan lay beyond those of the
Jindo&rsquo;s Taardad, in the same direction from Chaendaer, and they
paralleled the Jindo some quarter of a mile distant. According to
Rhuarc, Couladin should have waited another day for his brother to
return. That Rand had seen Muradin after he had plucked out his own
eyes made no difference; ten days was the time allotted. To leave
sooner was to abandon whoever had entered Rhuidean. Yet Couladin
had set the Shaido to folding their tents as soon as he saw the
Jindo pack animals being loaded. The Shaido moved along now with
their own scouts and rear guard, seemingly ignoring the Jindo, but
the space between never widened much beyond three hundred paces. It
was usual to have witnesses from perhaps half a dozen of the larger
septs when a man sought the marking of a clan chief. Couladin&rsquo;s
people outnumbered the Jindo by at least two to one. Rand suspected
that the third party, halfway between Shaido and Taardad, was the
reason the interval did not narrow suddenly and violently.</p>

<p>The Wise Ones walked just like all the other Aiel,
including those strange, white-robed men and women Rhuarc called
<em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>, who led their packhorses. Not servants,
exactly, but Rand was unsure he really understood Rhuarc&rsquo;s
explanation about honor and obligation and captives; Heirn had been
even more confusing, as though making an effort to explain why
water was wet. Moiraine, Egwene and Lan rode with the Wise Ones,
or at least the two women did. The Warder had his warhorse a little
off on the side of the Shaido, watching them as closely as he did
the rugged landscape. Sometimes Moiraine or Egwene or both got down
to walk awhile, talking with the Wise Ones. Rand would have given
his last penny to hear what they said. They looked in his direction
often, quick glances that he was doubtless not supposed to notice.
For some reason, Egwene was wearing her hair in two braids, plaited
with lengths of red ribbon, like a bride&rsquo;s. He did not know why. He
had commented on them before leaving Chaendaer&mdash;just
mentioned them&mdash;and she nearly took his head off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elayne is the woman for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked down at Aviendha in confusion. The
challenging look was back in her blue-green eyes, but still layered
atop stark dislike. She had been waiting outside the tent when he
awoke that morning, and had not strayed more than three paces from
him since. Clearly the Wise Ones had set her to spy, and clearly he
was not supposed to realize it. She was pretty, and he was assumed
to be fool enough not to see beyond that. No doubt that was the
real reason she wore skirts now, and carried no weapon beyond a
small beltknife. Women seemed to think men were simple-minded. Come
to think of it, none of the other Aiel had commented at her change
of clothing, but even Rhuarc avoided looking at her for too long.
Probably they knew why she was there, or had some inkling of the
Wise Ones&rsquo; plan, and did not want to speak of it.</p>

<p>Rhuidean. He still did not know why she had gone;
Rhuarc muttered about &ldquo;women&rsquo;s business,&rdquo; plainly reluctant to
discuss it around her. Considering the way she clung to Rand&rsquo;s
side, that meant not discussing it at all. The clan chief was
certainly listening now, and Heirn, and every Jindo in earshot. It
was hard to tell with Aiel, sometimes, but he thought they looked
amused. Mat was whistling softly, ostentatiously looking at
anything but the two of them. Even so, this was the first time all
day she had spoken to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>Her bulky skirts did not hinder her, walking along
beside Jeade&rsquo;en. No, not walking. Stalking. If she were a cat, she
would be lashing her tail. &ldquo;Elayne is a wetlander, your own kind.&rdquo;
She tossed her head arrogantly. The short tail that Aiel warriors
wore at the nape of the neck was missing. The folded scarf around
her temples nearly enveloped her hair. &ldquo;Exactly the woman for you.
Is she not beautiful? Her back is straight, her limbs supple and
strong, her lips like plump love-apples. Her hair is spun gold, her
eyes blue sapphires. Her skin is smoother than the finest silk, her
bosom fine and well-rounded. Her hips are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He cut her off frantically, his cheeks heating. &ldquo;I
know she&rsquo;s pretty. What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am describing her.&rdquo; Aviendha frowned up him. &ldquo;Have
you seen her in her bath? There is no need for me to describe her
if you have seen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have <em>not</em> seen!&rdquo; He wished he did not
sound strangled. Rhuarc and the others <em>were</em> listening,
faces too blank for anything but amusement. Mat rolled his eyes
with an open, roguish grin.</p>

<p>The woman only shrugged and rearranged her shawl.
&ldquo;She should have arranged it. But I have seen her, and I will act
as <em>her</em> near sister.&rdquo; The emphasis seemed to say <em>
his</em> &ldquo;near sister&rdquo; might have done the same; Aiel customs were
strange, but this was mad! &ldquo;Her hips&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave him a sideways glare. &ldquo;She is the woman for
you. Elayne has laid her heart at your feet for a bridal wreath. Do
you think there was anyone in the Stone of Tear who does not
know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not want to talk about Elayne,&rdquo; he told her
firmly. Certainly not if she meant to go on as she had begun. The
thought made his face go hot again. The woman did not seem to care
<em>what</em> she said, or who heard!</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do well to blush, putting her aside when she has
bared her heart to you.&rdquo; Aviendha&rsquo;s voice was hard and
contemptuous. &ldquo;Two letters she wrote, baring all as if she had
stripped herself beneath your mother&rsquo;s roof. You entice her into
corners for kisses, then reject her. She meant every word of those
letters, Rand al&rsquo;Thor! Egwene told me so. She meant every word.
What do you mean toward her, wetlander?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand scrubbed a hand through his hair, and had to
rearrange his <em>shoufa</em>. Elayne meant every word? In both
letters? That was flat impossible. One contradicted the other
nearly point for point! Suddenly he gave a start. <em>Egwene</em>
had told her? About Elayne&rsquo;s letters? Did women discuss these
things among themselves? Did they plan out between them how best to
confuse a man?</p>

<p>He found himself missing Min. Min had never made him
look a fool. Well, not more than once or twice. And she had never
insulted him. Well, she had called him &ldquo;sheepherder&rdquo; a few times.
But he felt comfortable around her, warm, in a strange way. She
never made him feel a complete idiot, like Elayne, and
Aviendha.</p>

<p>His silence seemed to irritate the Aiel woman more,
if such was possible. Muttering to herself, striding along as
though she wanted to trample something, she adjusted and readjusted
her shawl half a dozen times. Finally her grumbling faded away.
Instead, she began staring at him. Like a vulture. He could not see
how she did not trip and fall on her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you looking at me like that?&rdquo; he
demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am listening, Rand al&rsquo;Thor, since you wish me to
be silent.&rdquo; She smiled around gritted teeth. &ldquo;Do you not enjoy
having me listen to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He glanced beyond her at Mat, who shook his head.
There was just no understanding women. Rand tried to set himself to
considering what lay ahead, but it was difficult with the woman&rsquo;s
eyes on him. Pretty eyes, if they had not been full of spite, but
he did wish she would look at something else.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Shading his eyes against the sun&rsquo;s glare, Mat did his
best to avoid looking at Rand and the Aiel woman striding along
between their horses. He could not understand why Rand put up with
her. Aviendha was pretty enough, to be sure&mdash;more than just
pretty, especially now she wore a semblance of proper clothes&mdash;but with a viper for a tongue and a temper to make Nynaeve
look meek. He was just glad Rand was stuck with her and not
him.</p>

<p>He pulled the kerchief from his head and wiped the
sweat off of his face, then tied it back. The heat and the eternal
sun in his eyes were beginning to get to him. Was there no such
thing as shade in this whole land? Sweat stung his wounds. He had
refused Healing the night before, when Moiraine wakened him after
he had finally gotten to sleep. A few cuts were a small price to
avoid having the Power used on you, and the Wise Ones&rsquo;
filthy-tasting tea had settled his headache. Well, after a fashion,
anyway. What else ailed him, he did not think Moiraine could do
anything about, and he had no intention of telling her until he
understood it himself. If then. He didn&rsquo;t even want to think of
it.</p>

<p>Moiraine and the Wise Ones were watching him.
Watching Rand, actually, he supposed, but it felt the same.
Surprisingly, the sun-haired one, Melaine, had climbed up on Aldieb
behind the Aes Sedai, riding awkwardly and holding Moiraine around
the waist as they talked. He had not known Aiel would ride at all.
A very pretty woman, Melaine, with those fiery green eyes. Except,
of course, that she could channel. A man would have to be an utter
fool to tangle himself with one of those. Shifting in Pips&rsquo;s
saddle, he reminded himself that it did not matter to him what Aiel
did.</p>

<p><em>I&rsquo;ve been to Rhuidean. I&rsquo;ve done what those snake
folk said I had to</em>. And what did he have to show for it? <em>
This bloody spear, a silver medallion, and</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>I could
go now. If I have any sense, I will</em>.</p>

<p>He could go. Try to find his own way out of the Waste
before he died of thirst or sunstroke. He could if Rand was not
still pulling at him, holding him. The easiest manner of finding
out was just to try leaving. Looking at the bleak landscape, he
grimaced. A wind picked up&mdash;it felt as if it blew across an
overheated cookstove&mdash;and small whirlwinds spun funnels of
yellow dust across the cracked ground. Heat-haze made the distant
mountains shimmer. Maybe it was best to stay around a while
longer.</p>

<p>One of the Maidens who had been scouting ahead came
trotting back and fell in beside Rhuarc, speaking for his ear
alone. She flashed Mat a grin when she was done, and he busied
himself picking a sharp burr out of Pips&rsquo;s mane. He remembered her
all too well, a red-haired woman named Dorindha, about Egwene&rsquo;s
age. Dorindha was one of those who had talked him into trying
Maidens&rsquo; Kiss. She had collected the first forfeit. It was not that
he did not want to meet her eyes, certainly not that he could not;
keeping your horse free of burrs and the like was important.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peddlers,&rdquo; Rhuarc announced when Dorindha sprinted
off the way she had come. &ldquo;Peddlers&rsquo; wagons, heading in this
direction.&rdquo; He did not sound pleased.</p>

<p>Mat brightened considerably, though. A peddler might
be just the thing. If the fellow knew the way in, he knew the way
out. He wondered if Rand suspected what he was thinking; the man
had gone as blank faced as any of the Aiel.</p>

<p>The Aiel picked up their pace a little&mdash;Couladin&rsquo;s people imitated the Jindo and the Wise Ones&rsquo; party with
hardly a hesitation; their own scouts had probably brought word,
too&mdash;a quick enough step that the horses had to maintain a brisk
walk. The sun did not bother the Aiel at all, not even the <em>
gai&rsquo;shain</em> in their white robes. They flowed over the broken
ground.</p>

<p>Less than two miles brought the wagons in sight, a
dozen and a half of them, strung out in a line. All showed the wear
of hard travel, with spare wheels lashed everywhere. Despite a coat
of yellow dust, the first two looked like white-painted boxes on
wheels, or little houses, complete with wooden steps at the back
and a metal stove-chimney sticking through the roof. The last
three, drawn by twenty-mule hitches, appeared no more than huge
barrels, also white, doubtless full of water. Those in between
could have done for peddlers&rsquo; wagons in the Two Rivers, with high
stout-spoked wheels and clanking clusters of pots and things in big
net bags tied all along the tall round canvas covers.</p>

<p>The wagondrivers drew rein as soon as they spotted
the Aiel, waiting for the columns to come to them. A heavy man in a
pale gray coat and dark, wide-brimmed hat climbed down from the
back of the lead wagon and stood watching, now and then taking off
his flat-crowned hat to wipe his forehead with a large white
handkerchief. If he was nervous, looking at maybe fifteen hundred
Aiel sweeping toward him, Mat could not blame him. The strange
thing was the expressions on the Aiel nearest Mat. Rhuarc, trotting
ahead of Rand&rsquo;s horse, looked grim, and Heirn wore a face that could
break rocks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; Mat said. &ldquo;You look like you&rsquo;re
going to kill somebody.&rdquo; That would certainly put paid to his
hopes. &ldquo;I thought there were three kinds of people you Aiel let
come out here in the Waste; peddlers, gleemen, and the Traveling
People.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peddlers and gleemen are welcome,&rdquo; Heirn replied
curtly. If this was a welcome, Mat did not want to see Aiel being
unwelcoming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about the Traveling People?&rdquo; he asked
curiously. When Heirn kept silent, he added, &ldquo;Tinkers? The
Tuatha&rsquo;an?&rdquo; The sept chief&rsquo;s face grew even harder before he turned
his eyes back to the wagons. Aviendha shot Mat a look as if he were
a fool.</p>

<p>Rand drew Jeade&rsquo;en close to Pips. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d not mention
Tinkers to the Aiel if I were you,&rdquo; he said in a low voice. &ldquo;They
are a touchy subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you say so.&rdquo; Why would <em>Tinkers</em> be a
touchy subject? &ldquo;Looks to me like they&rsquo;re being touchy enough about
this peddler. Peddler! I can remember merchants who came to Emond&rsquo;s
Field with fewer wagons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He came into the Waste,&rdquo; Rand chuckled. Jeade&rsquo;en
tossed his head and danced a few steps. &ldquo;I wonder if he will leave
it again?&rdquo; Rand&rsquo;s twisted grin did not reach his eyes. Sometimes
Mat almost wished Rand would decide whether he was mad or not and
get, it over with. Almost.</p>

<p>Three hundred paces short of the wagons, Rhuarc
signaled a halt, and he and Heirn went on alone. At least, that
seemed to have been his intention, but Rand heeled his dapple
stallion after them, and the inevitable bodyguard of a hundred
Jindo followed. And Aviendha, of course, keeping close as though
tied to Rand&rsquo;s horse. Mat rode right with them. If Rhuarc sent this
fellow packing, he did not mean to miss his chance to go along.</p>

<p>Couladin came trotting out from the Shaido. Alone.
Perhaps he meant to do as Rhuarc and Heirn had intended, but Mat
suspected the man was pointing out that he went alone where Rand
needed a hundred guards. At first it seemed Moiraine was coming,
too, but words passed between the Wise Ones and her, and they all
stayed where they were. Watching, though. The Aes Sedai dismounted,
playing with something small that sparkled, and Egwene and the Wise
Ones clustered around her.</p>

<p>Despite his face mopping, the big, gray-coated fellow
did not appear uneasy up close, although he jumped when Maidens
suddenly rose out of the ground, encircling his wagons. The wagon
drivers, hard-faced men with more than enough scars and broken
noses to go around, looked ready to crawl under their seats; they
were tough alley dogs compared to Aiel wolves. The peddler
recovered right away. He was not fat for all his size; that
heaviness was muscle. Rand and Mat on their horses earned his
curious glances, but he singled out Rhuarc at once. His hooked beak
of a nose and dark, tilted eyes gave his square swarthy face a
predatory look not lessened when he put on a wide smile and swept
his broad-brimmed hat off in a bow. &ldquo;I am Hadnan Kadere,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;peddler. I seek Cold Rocks Hold, good sirs, but I will trade with
one and all. I have many fine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rhuarc cut him off like an icy knife. &ldquo;You head well
away from Cold Rocks, or any hold. How is it you have come this far
from the Dragonwall without acquiring a guide?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not really know, good sir.&rdquo; Kadere did not lose
his smile, but the comers of his mouth tightened a trifle. &ldquo;I have
traveled openly. This is my first visit to the Threefold Land so
far south. I thought perhaps here there are no guides.&rdquo; Couladin
snorted loudly, twirled one of his spears lazily. Kadere hunched
his shoulders as if he felt steel sliding into his thick body
already.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are always guides,&rdquo; Rhuarc said coldly. &ldquo;You
have luck to have come so far without one. Luck that you are not
dead, or walking back to the Dragonwall in your skin.&rdquo; Kadere
flashed an uneasy, toothy smile, and the clan Chief went on. &ldquo;Luck
to meet us. Had you continued this way another day or two, you
would have reached Rhuidean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The peddler&rsquo;s face went gray. &ldquo;I have heard&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He
stopped to swallow. &ldquo;I did not know, good sirs. You must believe, I
would not do such a thing deliberately. Nor by accident,&rdquo; he added
hastily. &ldquo;The Light illumine my words for truth, good sirs, I would
not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is well,&rdquo; Rhuarc told him. &ldquo;The penalties are
severe. You may travel with me to Cold Rocks. It would not do for
you to become lost again. The Three-fold Land can be a dangerous
place for those who do not know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Couladin&rsquo;s head came up defiantly. &ldquo;Why not with me?&rdquo;
he said in a sharp voice. &ldquo;The Shaido are the more numerous here,
Rhuarc. By custom, he travels with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you become a clan chief when I did not see?&rdquo;
The fire-haired Shaido flushed, but Rhuarc showed no hint of
satisfaction, only went on in that level voice. &ldquo;The peddler seeks
Cold Rocks. He will journey with me. The Shaido with you may trade
with him as we travel. The Taardad are not so starved for peddlers
that we try to keep them to ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Couladin&rsquo;s face went even darker, yet he moderated
his tone, even if it did creak with the effort. &ldquo;I will camp near
Cold Rocks, Rhuarc. He Who Comes With the Dawn concerns <em>
all</em> Aiel, not only the Taardad. The Shaido will have their
proper place. The Shaido, too, will follow He Who Comes With the
Dawn.&rdquo; He had not, Mat realized, acknowledged that that was Rand.
Peering at the wagons, Rand did not seem to be listening.</p>

<p>Rhuarc was silent a moment. &ldquo;The Shaido will be
welcome guests in the lands of the Taardad, if they come to follow
He Who Comes With the Dawn.&rdquo; And that could be taken two ways, as
well.</p>

<p>Kadere had been mopping his face all this time,
likely seeing himself in the middle of a battle between Aiel. He
punctuated Rhuarc&rsquo;s invitation with a heavy sigh of relief. &ldquo;Thank
you, good sirs. Thank you.&rdquo; Probably for not killing him. &ldquo;Perhaps
you would care to see what my wagons have to offer? Some special
thing you might like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Later,&rdquo; Rhuarc said. &ldquo;We will stop at Imre
Stand for the night, and you may show your wares then.&rdquo;
Couladin was already striding away, having heard the name of
Imre Stand, whatever that was. Kadere started to put his hat
back on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A hat,&rdquo; Mat said, reining Pips closer to the
peddler. If he had to remain in the Waste a bit longer, at least he
could keep that bloody sun out of his eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give a gold mark
for a hat like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; called a woman&rsquo;s huskily melodious voice.</p>

<p>Mat looked around, and gave a start. The only woman
in sight beside Aviendha and the Maidens was walking up from the
second wagon, but she certainly did not match that voice, one of
the loveliest he had ever heard. Rand frowned at her and shook his
head, and he had cause. A foot shorter than Kadere, she must have
weighed as much or more. Rolls of fat nearly hid her dark eyes,
disguising whether they were tilted or not, but her nose was a
hatchet that dwarfed the peddler&rsquo;s. In a dress of pale-cream silk
stretched tight around her bulk, with a white lace shawl held above
her bead on elaborate ivory combs thrust into long, coarse black
hair, she moved with incongruous lightness, almost like one of the
Maidens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good offer,&rdquo; she said in those musical tones. &ldquo;I
am Keille Shaogi, peddler.&rdquo; She snatched the hat away from Kadere
and thrust it up at Mat. &ldquo;Stout, good sir, and nearly new. You will
need its like to survive the Three-fold Land. Here, a man can die&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Fat fingers made a whip-crack. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;like so.&rdquo; Her sudden
laugh had the same throaty, caressing quality as her voice. &ldquo;Or a
woman. A gold mark, you said.&rdquo; When he hesitated, her half-buried
eyes glittered raven black. &ldquo;I seldom offer any man a bargain
twice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A peculiar woman to say the least. Kadere made no
protest beyond the slightest grimace. If Keille was his partner,
there was no doubt who was the senior. And if the hat kept Mat&rsquo;s
head from broiling, it really was worth the price so far as he was
concerned. She bit the Tairen mark he handed her before releasing
the hat. For a wonder, it fit. And if it was no cooler under that
wide brim, at least it was blessedly shady. The kerchief went into
his coat pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything for the rest of you?&rdquo; The stout woman ran
her eye over the Aiel, murmuring, &ldquo;What a pretty child&rdquo; to Aviendha
with a baring of teeth that might have been a smile. To Rand, she
said sweetly, &ldquo;And you, good sir?&rdquo; That voice coming out of that
face was truly jarring, especially when it took on this honeyed
tone. &ldquo;Something to shelter you from this desperate land?&rdquo; Turning
Jeade&rsquo;en so he could peer at the wagon drivers, Rand only shook his
head. With that <em>shoufa</em> around his face, he really did look
like an Aiel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tonight, Keille,&rdquo; Kadere said. &ldquo;We open trade
tonight, at a place called Imre Stand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do we, now.&rdquo; For a long moment she peered at the
Shaido column, and at the Wise Ones&rsquo; party for a longer. Abruptly
she turned for her own wagon, saying over her shoulder to the other
peddler, &ldquo;Then why are you keeping these good sirs standing here?
Move, Kadere. Move.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stared after her, shaking his head again.</p>

<p>There was a gleeman back by her wagon. Mat blinked,
thinking the heat had gotten to him, but the fellow did not vanish,
a dark-haired man in his middle years wearing a patch-covered cloak.
He watched the gathering apprehensively until Keille shoved him up
the wagon&rsquo;s step ahead of her. Kadere looked at her white wagon
with less expression than one of the Aiel before stalking off to
his own. Truly an odd lot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see the gleeman?&rdquo; Mat asked Rand, who
nodded vaguely, eyeing the line of wagons as if he had never seen
a wagon before. Rhuarc and Heirn were already on their way back to
the rest of the Jindo. The hundred surrounding Rand waited
patiently, dividing their gaze between him and anything that might
hide even a mouse. The drivers began gathering their reins, but
Rand did not move. &ldquo;Strange people these peddlers, wouldn&rsquo;t you
say, Rand? But I suppose you have to be strange to come to the
Waste. Look at us.&rdquo; That brought a grimace from Aviendha, but Rand
seemed not to have heard. Mat wanted him to say something.
Anything. This silence was unnerving. &ldquo;Would you have thought
escorting a peddler would be such an honor Rhuarc and Couladin
would argue over it? Do you understand any of this <em>
ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You <em>are</em> a fool,&rdquo; Aviendha muttered. &ldquo;It
had nothing to do with <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>. Couladin tries to behave
as a clan chief. Rhuarc cannot allow that until&mdash;unless&mdash;he has gone to Rhuidean. The Shaido would steal bones from a
dog&mdash;they would steal the bones <em>and</em> the dog&mdash;yet even they deserve a true chief. And because of Rand al&rsquo;Thor we
must allow a thousand of them to pitch their tents in our
lands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His eyes,&rdquo; Rand said without looking away from the
wagons. &ldquo;A dangerous man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat frowned at him. &ldquo;Whose eyes? Couladin&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kadere&rsquo;s eyes. All that sweating, going white in the
face. Yet his eyes never changed. You always have to watch the
eyes. Not what he seems.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, Rand.&rdquo; Mat shifted in his saddle, half lifted
his reins as if to ride on. Maybe silence had not been so bad. &ldquo;You
have to watch the eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand changed his study to the tops of the nearest
spires and buttes, twisting his head this way and that. &ldquo;Time is
the risk,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Time sets snares. I have to avoid theirs
while setting mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was nothing up there that Mat could make out
beyond an occasional scattering of brush and now and then a stunted
tree. Aviendha frowned at the heights, then at Rand, adjusting her
shawl. &ldquo;Snares?&rdquo; Mat said. <em>Light, let him give me an answer
that isn&rsquo;t crazy</em>. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s setting snares?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Rand looked at him as if he did not
understand the question. The peddlers&rsquo; wagons were starting off
with an escort of Maidens loping alongside, turning to follow the
Jindo as they trotted past, mirrored by the Shaido. More Maidens
sped ahead to scout. Only the Aiel around Rand stood still, though
the Wise Ones&rsquo; party dawdled and watched, and from Egwene&rsquo;s
gestures, Mat thought she wanted to come check on them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t see it, or feel it,&rdquo; Rand said finally.
Leaning a little toward Mat, he whispered loudly, as though
pretending. &ldquo;We ride with evil now, Mat. Watch yourself.&rdquo; He wore
that twisted grin again, as he watched the wagons lumber by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think this Kadere is <em>evil</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A dangerous man, Mat&mdash;the eyes always give it
away&mdash;yet who can say? But what cause have I to worry, with
Moiraine and the Wise Ones watching out for me? And we mustn&rsquo;t
forget Lanfear. Has any man ever been under so many watchful eyes?&rdquo;
Abruptly Rand straightened in his saddle. &ldquo;It has begun,&rdquo; be said
quietly. &ldquo;Wish that I have your luck, Mat. It has begun, and there
is no turning back, now, however the blade falls.&rdquo; Nodding to
himself, he started his dapple after Rhuarc, Aviendha trotting
alongside, the hundred Jindo following.</p>

<p>Mat was glad enough to follow too. Better than being
left there, certainly. The sun burned high in a stark blue sky.
There was a lot of traveling yet to be done before sunset. It had
begun? What did he mean, it had begun? It had begun in Rhuidean; or
better, in Emond&rsquo;s Field on Winternight a year gone. &ldquo;Riding with
evil&rdquo; and &ldquo;no turning back&rdquo;? And Lanfear? Rand was walking the
razor&rsquo;s edge, now. No doubt about it. There had to be a way out of
the Waste before it was too late. From time to time Mat studied the
peddlers&rsquo; wagons. Before it was too late. If it was not
already.</p>
