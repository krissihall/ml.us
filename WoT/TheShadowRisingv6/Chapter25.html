<h4><em>The Road to the Spear</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">N</span>ot
hesitating at the first row of columns, Rand made
himself walk in among them. There could be no turning back now, no
looking back. <em>Light, what is supposed to happen in here? What
does it really do?</em></p>

<p>Clear as the finest glass, perhaps a foot thick and
standing three paces or more apart, the columns were a forest of
dazzling light filled with cascading ripples and glares and odd
rainbows. The air was cooler here, enough to make him wish he had a
coat, but the same gritty dust covered the smooth white stone under
his boots. Not a breeze stirred, yet something made each hair on
his body shift, even under his shirt.</p>

<p>Ahead and to the right he could just see another man,
in the grays and browns of Aiel, stiff and statue-still in the
changing lights. That must be Muradin, Couladin&rsquo;s brother. Stiff
and still; <em>something</em> was happening. Strangely, considering
the brilliance, Rand could make out the Aiel&rsquo;s face clearly. Eyes
wide and staring, face tight, mouth quivering on the brink of a
snarl. Whatever he was seeing, he did not like it. But Muradin had
survived that far, at least. If he could do it, Rand could. The man
was six or seven paces ahead of him at best. Wondering why he and
Mat had not seen Muradin go in, he took another step.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">He rode behind a set of eyes, feeling but not
controlling a body. The owner of those eyes crouched easily among
boulders on a barren mountainside, beneath a sun blasted sky,
peering down at strange half-made stone structures&mdash;<em>
No!</em> Less <em>than half-made. That&rsquo;s Rhuidean, but without any
fog, and only just begun</em>&mdash;peering down contemptuously.
He was Mandein, young for a sept chief at forty. Separateness
faded; acceptance came. He was Mandein.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must agree,&rdquo; Sealdre said, but for the moment he
ignored her.</p>

<p>The Jenn had made things to draw up water and spill
it into great stone basins. He had fought battles over less water
than one of those tanks held, with people walking by as though
water was of no consequence. A strange forest of glass rose in the
center of all their activity, glittering in the sun, and near it
the tallest tree he had ever seen, at least three spans high. Their
stone structures looked as if each was meant to contain an entire
hold, an entire sept, when done. Madness. This Rhuidean could not
be defended. Not that anyone would attack the Jenn, of course. Most
avoided the Jenn as they avoided the accursed Lost Ones, who
wandered searching for the songs they claimed would bring back lost
days.</p>

<p>A procession snaked out of Rhuidean toward the
mountain, a few dozen Jenn and two palanquins, each carried by
eight men. There was enough wood in each of those palanquins for a
dozen chief&rsquo;s chairs. He had heard there were still Aes Sedai among
the Jenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must agree to whatever they ask, husband,&rdquo;
Sealdre said.</p>

<p>He looked at her then, wanting for a moment to run
his hands through her long golden hair, seeing the laughing girl
who had laid the bridal wreath at his feet and asked him to marry
her. She was serious now, though, intent and worried. &ldquo;Will the
others come?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some. Most. I have talked to my sisters in the
dream, and we have all dreamed the same dream. The chiefs who do
not come, and those who do not agree&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Their septs will die,
Mandein. Within three generations they will be dust, and their
holds and cattle belong to other septs. Their names will be
lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not like her talking to the Wise Ones of other
septs, even in dreams. But the Wise Ones dreamed true. When they
knew, it was true. &ldquo;Stay here,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;If I do not return,
help our sons and daughters to hold the sept together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She touched his cheek. &ldquo;I will, shade of my life. But
remember. You must agree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mandein motioned, and a hundred veiled shapes
followed him down the slope, ghosting from boulder to boulder, bows
and spears ready, grays and browns blending with the barren land,
vanishing even to his eyes. They were all men; he had left all the
women of the sept who carried the spear with the men around
Sealdre. If anything went wrong and she decided on something
senseless to save him, the men would probably follow her in it; the
women would see her back to the hold whatever she wanted, to
protect the hold and the sept. He hoped they would. Sometimes they
could be fiercer than any man, and more foolish.</p>

<p>The procession from Rhuidean had stopped on the
cracked clay flat by the time he reached the lower slope. He
motioned his men to ground and went on alone, lowering his veil. He
was aware of other men moving out from the mountain to his right
and left, coming across the baked ground from other directions. How
many? Fifty? Maybe a hundred? Some faces he had expected to see
were missing. Sealdre was right as usual; some had not listened to
their Wise Ones&rsquo; dream. There were faces he had never seen before,
and faces of men he had tried to kill, men who had tried to kill
him. At least none were veiled. Killing in front of a Jenn was
almost as bad as killing a Jenn. He hoped the others remembered
that. Treachery from one, and the veils would be donned; the
warriors each chief had brought would come down from the mountains,
and this dry clay would be muddied with blood. He half-expected to
feel a spear through his ribs any moment.</p>

<p>Even trying to watch a hundred possible sources of
death, it was hard not to stare at the Aes Sedai as the bearers
lowered their ornately carved chairs to the ground. Women with hair
so white it almost seemed transparent. Ageless faces with skin that
looked as if the wind might tear it. He had heard the years did not
touch Aes Sedai. How old must these two be? What had they seen?
Could they remember when his greatfather Comran first found Ogier
<em>stedding</em> in the Dragonwall and began to trade with them?
Or maybe even when Comran&rsquo;s greatfather Rhodric led the Aiel to
kill the men in iron shirts who had crossed the Dragonwall? The Aes
Sedai turned their eyes on him&mdash;sharp blue and dark, dark
brown, the first dark eyes he had ever seen&mdash;and seemed to
see inside his skull, inside his thoughts. He knew himself chosen
out, and did not know why. With an effort he pulled away from those
twin gazes, which knew him better than he knew himself.</p>

<p>A gaunt white-haired man, tall if stooped, came
forward from the Jenn flanked by two graying women who might have
been sisters, with the same deep-set green eyes and the same way of
tilting their heads when they looked at anything. The rest of the
Jenn stared uneasily at the earth rather than at the Aiel, but not
these three.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Dermon,&rdquo; the man said in a deep strong voice,
his blue eyed scrutiny as steady as any Aiel&rsquo;s. &ldquo;These are Mordaine
and Narisse.&rdquo; He gestured to the women beside him in turn. &ldquo;We
speak for Rhuidean, and the Jenn Aiel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A stir ran through the men around Mandein. Most of
them liked the Jenn claiming to be Aiel no better than he did. &ldquo;Why
have you called us here?&rdquo; he demanded, though it burned his tongue
to admit being summoned.</p>

<p>Instead of answering, Dermon said, &ldquo;Why do you not
carry a sword?&rdquo; That brought angry mutters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is forbidden,&rdquo; Mandein growled. &ldquo;Even Jenn should
know that.&rdquo; He lifted his spears, touched the knife at his waist,
the bow on his back. &ldquo;These are weapons enough for a warrior.&rdquo; The
mutters became approving, including some from men who had sworn to
kill him. They still would, given the chance, but they approved of
what he had said. And they seemed content to let him talk, with
those Aes Sedai watching.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not know why,&rdquo; Mordaine said, and Narisse
added, &ldquo;There is too much you do not know. Yet you must know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; Mandein demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You.&rdquo; Dermon ran his eyes across the Aiel, making
that one word fit them all. &ldquo;Whoever would lead among you must come
to Rhuidean and learn where we came from, and why you do not carry
swords. Who cannot learn, will not live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Wise Ones have spoken to you,&rdquo; Mordaine said,
&ldquo;or you would not be here. You know the cost to those who
refuse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Charendin pushed his way to the front, alternately
glaring at Mandein and the Jenn. Mandein had put that long puckered
scar down his face; they had nearly killed each other three times.
&ldquo;Just come to you?&rdquo; Charendin said. &ldquo;Whichever of us comes to you
will lead the Aiel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; The word came thin as a whisper, but strong
enough to fill every ear. It came from the dark eyed Aes Sedai
sitting in her carved chair with a blanket across her legs as if
she felt cold under the broiling sun. &ldquo;That one will come later,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;The stone that never falls will fall to announce his
coming. Of the blood, but not raised by the blood, he will come
from Rhuidean at dawn, and tie you together with bonds you cannot
break. He will take you back, and he will destroy you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some of the sept chiefs moved as if to leave, but
none took more than a few steps. Each had listened to the Wise One
of his sept. <em>Agree, or we will be destroyed as if we never
were. Agree, or we will destroy ourselves</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is some trick,&rdquo; Charendin shouted. Under Aes
Sedai stares he lowered his voice, but it held anger yet. &ldquo;You mean
to gain control of the septs. Aiel bend knee to no man or woman.&rdquo;
He jerked his head, avoiding the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;To no one,&rdquo; he
muttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We seek no control,&rdquo; Narisse told them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our days dwindle,&rdquo; Mordaine said. &ldquo;A day will come
when the Jenn are no more, and only you will remain to remember the
Aiel. You must remain, or all is for nothing, and lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The flatness of her voice, the calm sureness,
silenced Charendin, but Mandein had one more question. &ldquo;Why? If you
know your doom, why do this?&rdquo; He gestured toward the structures
rising in the distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is our purpose,&rdquo; Dermon replied calmly. &ldquo;For long
years we searched for this place, and now we prepare it, if not for
the purpose we once thought. We do what we must, and keep
faith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mandein studied the man&rsquo;s face. There was no fear in
it. &ldquo;You are Aiel,&rdquo; he said, and when some of the other chiefs
gasped, he raised his voice. &ldquo;I will go to the Jenn Aiel. &rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may not come to Rhuidean armed,&rdquo; Dermon
said.</p>

<p>Mandein laughed aloud at the temerity of the man.
Asking an Aiel to go unarmed. Shedding his weapons, he stepped
forward. &ldquo;Take me to Rhuidean, Aiel. I will match your
courage.&rdquo;</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Rand blinked in the flickering lights. He had <em>
been</em> Mandein; he could still feel contempt for the Jenn fading
into admiration. Were the Jenn Aiel, or were they not? They had
looked the same, tall, with light-colored eyes in sun-darkened
faces, dressed in the same clothes except for lacking veils. But
there had not been a weapon among them save for simple belt knives,
suitable for work. There was no such thing as an Aiel without
weapons.</p>

<p>He was farther into the columns than a single step
could account for, and closer to Muradin than he had been. The
Aiel&rsquo;s fixed stare had become a dire frown.</p>

<p>Gritty dust crunched under Rand&rsquo;s boots as he stepped
forward.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">His name was Rhodric, and he was nearly twenty. The
sun was a golden blister in the sky, but he kept his veil up and
his eyes alert. His spears were ready&mdash;one in his right hand, three
held with his small bullhide buckler&mdash;and he was ready. Jeordam was
down on the brown grass flat to the south of the hills, where most
of the bushes were puny and withered. The old man&rsquo;s hair was white,
like that thing called snow the old ones talked of, but his eyes
were sharp, and watching the welldiggers haul up filled waterbags
would not occupy all of his attention.</p>

<p>Mountains rose to the north and east, the northern
range tall and sharp and white-tipped but dwarfed by the eastern
monsters. Those looked as if the world was trying to touch the
heavens, and perhaps did. Maybe that white was snow? He would not
find out. Faced with this, the Jenn must decide to turn east. They
had trailed north along that mountainous wall for long months,
painfully dragging their wagons behind them, trying to deny the
Aiel that followed them. At least there had been water when they
crossed a river, even if not much. It had been years since Rhodric
had seen a river he could not wade across; most were only cracked
dry clay away from the mountains. He hoped the rains would come
again, and make things green once more. He remembered when the
world was green.</p>

<p>He heard the horses before he saw them, three men
riding across the brown hills in long leather shirts sewn all over
with metal discs, two with lances. He knew the one in the lead,
Garam, son of the chief of the town just out of sight back the way
they came and not much older than himself. They were blind, these
townsmen. They did not see the Aiel who stirred after they passed,
then settled back to near invisibility in the sere land. Rhodric
lowered his veil; there would be no killing unless the riders began
it. He did not regret it&mdash;not exactly&mdash;but he could not make himself
trust men who lived in houses and towns. There had been too many
battles with that kind. The stories said it had always been so.</p>

<p>Garam drew rein, raising his right hand in salute. He
was a slight dark-eyed man, like his two followers, but all three
looked tough and competent. &ldquo;Ho, Rhodric. Have your people finished
filling their waterskins, yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you, Garam.&rdquo; He kept his voice level and
expressionless. It made him uneasy, seeing men on horses, even more
so than their carrying swords. The Aiel had pack animals, but there
was something unnatural about sitting atop a horse. A man&rsquo;s legs
were good enough. &ldquo;We are close. Does your father withdraw his
permission for us to take water on his lands?&rdquo; No other town had
ever given permission before. Water had to be fought for if men
were near, just like everything else, and if there was water, then
men were near. It would not be easy to take these three by himself.
He shifted his feet in readiness to dance, and likely die.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He does not,&rdquo; Garam said. He had not even noticed
Rhodric&rsquo;s shift. &ldquo;We have a strong spring in the town, and my
father says that when you go, we will have the new wells you have
dug until we go ourselves. But your grandfather seemed to want to
know if the others started to move, and they have.&rdquo; He leaned an
elbow on the front of his saddle. &ldquo;Tell me, Rhodric, are they truly
the same people as yourselves?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are the Jenn Aiel; we, the Aiel. We are the
same, yet not. I cannot explain it further, Garam.&rdquo; He did not
really understand it himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which way do they move?&rdquo; Jeordam asked.</p>

<p>Rhodric bowed to his greatfather calmly; he had heard
a footfall, the sound of a soft boot, and had known it for an
Aiel&rsquo;s. The townsmen had not noticed Jeordam&rsquo;s approach, though,
and they jerked their reins in surprise. Only Garam&rsquo;s upflung hand
stopped the other two from lowering their lances. Rhodric and his
greatfather waited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;East,&rdquo; Garam said when he had his horse under
control again. &ldquo;Across the Spine of the World.&rdquo; He gestured to the
mountains that stabbed the sky.</p>

<p>Rhodric winced, but Jeordam said coolly, &ldquo;What lies
on the other side?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The end of the world, for all I know,&rdquo; Garam
replied. &ldquo;I am not sure there is a way across.&rdquo; He hesitated. &ldquo;The
Jenn have Aes Sedai with them. Dozens, I have heard. Does it not
make you uneasy traveling close to Aes Sedai? I have heard the
world was different once, but they destroyed it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai made Rhodric very nervous, though he
kept his face blank. They were only four, not dozens, but enough to
make him remember stories that the Aiel had failed the Aes Sedai in
some way that no one knew. The Aes Sedai must know; they had seldom
left the Jenn&rsquo;s wagons in the year since their arrival, but when
they did, they looked at the Aiel with sad eyes. Rhodric was not
the only one who tried to avoid them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We guard the Jenn,&rdquo; Jeordam said. &ldquo;It is they who
travel with Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garam nodded as if that made a difference, then
leaned forward again, lowering his voice. &ldquo;My father has an Aes
Sedai advisor, though he tries to keep it from the town. She says
we must leave these hills and move east. She says the dry rivers
will run again, and we will build a great city beside one. She says
many things. I hear the Aes Sedai plan to build a city&mdash;they
have found Ogier to build it for them. Ogier!&rdquo; He shook his head,
pulling himself from legends back to reality. &ldquo;Do you think they
mean to rule the world once more? The Aes Sedai? I think we should
kill them before they can destroy us again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must do as you think best.&rdquo; Jeordam&rsquo;s voice gave
no hint of his own thoughts. &ldquo;I must ready my people to cross those
mountains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dark-haired man straightened in his saddle,
plainly disappointed. Rhodric suspected he had wanted Aiel help in
killing Aes Sedai. &ldquo;The Spine of the World,&rdquo; Garam said brusquely.
&ldquo;It has another name. Some call it the Dragonwall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fitting name,&rdquo; Jeordam replied.</p>

<p>Rhodric stared at the towering mountains in the
distance. A fitting name for Aiel. Their own secret name, told to
no one, was People of the Dragon. He did not know why, only that it
was not spoken aloud except when you received your spears. What lay
beyond this Dragonwall? At least there would be people to fight.
There always were. In the whole world there were only Aiel, Jenn,
and enemies. Only that. Aiel, Jenn, and enemies.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Rand drew a deep breath that rasped as if he had not
breathed for hours. Eye-splitting rings of light ran up the columns
around him. The words still echoed in his mind. Aiel, Jenn, and
enemies; that was the world. They had not been in the Waste,
certainly. He had seen&mdash;lived&mdash;a time before the Aiel
came to their Three-fold Land.</p>

<p>He was nearer still to Muradin. The Aiel&rsquo;s eyes
shifted uneasily, and he seemed to struggle against taking another
step.</p>

<p>Rand moved forward.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Squatting easily on the white-cloaked hillside,
Jeordam ignored the cold as he watched five people tramp toward
him. Three cloaked men, two women in bulky dresses, making hard
work of the snow. Winter should have been over long since,
according to the old ones, but then they told stories of the
seasons changing from what they had always been. They claimed the
earth used to shake, too, and mountains rose or sank like the water
in a summer pond when you threw a rock in. Jeordam did not believe
it. He was eighteen, born in the tents, and this was the only life
he had ever known. The snow, the tents, and the duty to
protect.</p>

<p>He lowered his veil and stood slowly, leaning on his
long spear so as not to frighten the wagon folk, but they stopped
abruptly anyway, staring at the spear, at the bow slung across his
back and the quiver at his waist. None appeared any older than
himself. &ldquo;You have need of us, Jenn?&rdquo; he called.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You name us that to mock us,&rdquo; a tall, sharp-nosed
fellow shouted back, &ldquo;but it is true. We <em>are</em> the only true
Aiel. You have given up the Way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a lie!&rdquo; Jeordam snapped. &ldquo;I have never held
a sword!&rdquo; He drew a deep breath to calm himself. He had not been
put out here to grow angry with Jenn. &ldquo;If you are lost, your wagons
are that way.&rdquo; He pointed southward with his spear.</p>

<p>One woman placed a hand on sharp-nose&rsquo;s arm and spoke
quietly. The others nodded, and finally sharp-nose did, too, if
reluctantly. She was pretty, with yellow wisps of hair escaping the
dark shawl wrapped around her head. Facing Jeordam, she said, &ldquo;We
are not lost.&rdquo; She peered at him suddenly, seeming to see him for
the first time, and tightened her shawl around her.</p>

<p>He nodded; he had not thought they were. The Jenn
usually managed to avoid anyone from the tents even when they
needed help. The few who did not came only in desperation, for the
help they could not find elsewhere. &ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a mile across the hills to his father&rsquo;s tents,
low shapes partially covered by the last snowfall, clinging to the
slopes. His own people watched the new arrivals cautiously, but did
not stop what they were doing, whether cooking or tending weapons
or tossing snowballs with a child. He was proud of his sept, nearly
two hundred people, largest of the ten camps scattered north of the
wagons. The Jenn did not seem much impressed, though. It irritated
him that there were so many more Jenn than Aiel.</p>

<p>Lewin came out of his tent, a tall, graying man with
a hard face; Lewin never smiled, they said, and Jeordam had
certainly never seen it. Maybe he had before Jeordam&rsquo;s mother died
of a fever, but Jeordam did not believe it.</p>

<p>The yellow-haired woman&mdash;her name was Morin&mdash;told a story much as Jeordam had expected. The Jenn had
traded with a village, a place with a log wall, and then men from
the village had come in the night, taking back what had been traded
for, taking more. The Jenn always thought they could trust people
who lived in houses, always thought the Way would protect them. The
dead were listed&mdash;fathers, a mother, first-brothers. The
captives&mdash;first-sisters, a sister-mother, a daughter. That
last surprised Jeordam; it was Morin who spoke bitterly of a
five-year-old daughter carried off to be raised by some other woman.
Studying her more closely, he mentally added a few years to her
age.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will bring them back,&rdquo; Lewin promised. He took a
bundle of spears handed to him and thrust them point-down into the
ground. &ldquo;You may stay with us if you wish, so long as you are
willing to defend yourselves and the rest of us. If you stay, you
will never be allowed back among the wagons.&rdquo; The sharp-nosed
fellow turned at that and hurried back the way they had come. Lewin
went on; it was seldom that only one left at this point. &ldquo;Those who
wish to come with us to this village, take a spear. But remember,
if you take the spear to use against men, you will have to stay
with us.&rdquo; His voice and eyes were stone. &ldquo;You will be dead as far
the Jenn are concerned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the remaining men hesitated, but each finally
pulled a spear from the ground. So did Morin. Jeordam gaped at her,
and even Lewin blinked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not have to take a spear just to stay,&rdquo; Lewin
told her, &ldquo;or for us to bring back your people. Taking the spear
means a willingness to fight, not just to defend yourself. You can
put it down; there is no shame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have my daughter,&rdquo; Morin said.</p>

<p>To Jeordam&rsquo;s shock, Lewin barely paused before
nodding. &ldquo;There is a first time for all things. For all things. So
be it.&rdquo; He began tapping men on the shoulder, walking through the
camps, naming them to visit this log-walled village. Jeordam was
the first tapped; his father had always chosen him first since the
day he was old enough to carry a spear. He would have had it no
other way.</p>

<p>Morin was having problems with the spear, the haft
tangling in her long skirts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not have to go,&rdquo; Jeordam told her. &ldquo;No woman
ever has before. We will bring your daughter to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean to bring Kirin out of there myself,&rdquo; she said
fiercely. &ldquo;You will not stop me.&rdquo; A stubborn woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that case, you must dress like this.&rdquo; He gestured
to his own gray-brown coat and breeches. &ldquo;You cannot walk cross
country in the night in a dress.&rdquo; He took the spear away from her
before she could react. &ldquo;The spear is not easily learned.&rdquo; The two
men who had come with her, awkwardly receiving instruction and
nearly falling over their own feet, were proof of that. He found a
hatchet and chopped a pace from the spear shaft, leaving four feet,
counting nearly a foot of steel point. &ldquo;Stab with it. No more than
that. Just stab. The haft is used for blocking, too, but I will
find you something to use as a shield in your other hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him strangely. &ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo; she
asked, even more oddly. He told her, and she only nodded
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>After a moment, he said, &ldquo;Is one of those men your
husband?&rdquo; They were still tripping over their spears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My husband mourns Kirin already. He cares more for
the trees than his own daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The trees?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Trees of Life.&rdquo; When he still looked at her
blankly, she shook her head. &ldquo;Three little trees planted in
barrels. They care for them almost as well as they do for
themselves. When they find a place of safety, they mean to plant
them; they say the old days will return, then. They. I said they.
Very well. I am not Jenn anymore.&rdquo; She hefted the shortened spear.
&ldquo;This is my husband now.&rdquo; Eyeing him closely, she asked, &ldquo;If
someone stole your child, would you talk of the Way of the Leaf and
suffering sent to test us?&rdquo; He shook his head, and she said, &ldquo;I
thought not. You will make a fine father. Teach me to use this
spear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An odd woman, but pretty. He took the spear back and
began to show her, working out what he was doing while he did. With
the short haft, it was quick and agile.</p>

<p>Morin was watching him with that strange smile, but
the spear had caught him up. &ldquo;I saw your face in the dream,&rdquo; she
said softly, but he did not really hear. With a spear like this, he
could be quicker than a man with a sword. In his mind&rsquo;s eye he
could see the Aiel defeating all the men with swords. No one would
stand against them. No one.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Lights flashed through the glass columns, half-blinding
Rand. Muradin was only a pace or two ahead, staring
straight in front of him, teeth bared, snarling silently. The
columns were taking them back, into the time lost history of the
Aiel. Rand&rsquo;s feet moved of their own accord. Forward. And back in
time.</p>

<p class="drop">Lewin adjusted the dustveil across his face and
peered down into the small camp where the coals of a dying fire
still glowed beneath an iron cookpot. The wind brought him a smell
of half burned stew. Mounds of blankets surrounded the coals in the
moonlight. There were no horses in sight. He wished he had brought
some water, but only the children were allowed water except with
meals. He vaguely remembered a time when there had been more water,
when the days were not so hot and dusty and the wind had not blown
all the time. Night was only a small relief, trading a dull, fiery
red sun for cold. He wrapped himself tighter in the cape of wild
goatskins he used for a blanket.</p>

<p>His companions scrambled closer, bundled as he was,
kicking rocks and muttering until he was sure they would wake the
men below. He did not complain; he was no more used to this than
they. Dustveils hid their faces, but he could make out who was who.
Luca, with his shoulders half again as wide as anyone else&rsquo;s; he
liked to play tricks. Gearan, lanky as a stork and the best runner
among the wagons. Charlin and Alijha, alike as reflections except
for Charlin&rsquo;s habit of tilting his head when he was worried, as he
was now; their sister Colline was down in that camp. And Maigran,
Lewin&rsquo;s sister.</p>

<p>When the girls&rsquo; gathering bags were found on ground
torn by a struggle, everyone else was ready to mourn and go on as
they had done so many times before. Even Lewin&rsquo;s greatfather. If
Adan had known what the five of them planned, he would have stopped
them. All Adan did now was mutter about keeping faith with the Aes
Sedai Lewin had never seen, that and try to keep the Aiel alive.
The Aiel as a people, but not any one given Aiel. Not even
Maigran.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are four,&rdquo; Lewin whispered. &ldquo;The girls are this
side of the fire. I will wake them&mdash;quietly&mdash;and we
will sneak them away while the men sleep.&rdquo; His friends looked at
each other, nodded. He supposed they should have made a plan before
this, but all they had been able to think of was coming to get the
girls, and how to leave the wagons without being seen. He had not
been certain they could follow these men, or find them before they
reached the village they came from, a collection of rough huts
where the Aiel had been driven away with stones and sticks. There
would be nothing to be done if the takers got that far.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What if they do wake?&rdquo; Gearan asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not leave Colline,&rdquo; Charlin snapped, right on
top of his brother&rsquo;s quieter &ldquo;We are taking them back, Gearan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are,&rdquo; Lewin agreed. Luca poked Gearan&rsquo;s ribs, and
Gearan nodded.</p>

<p>Making their way down in the darkness was no easy
task. Drought dried twigs snapped under their feet; rocks and
pebbles showered down the dry slope ahead of them. The harder Lewin
tried to move silently, the more noise he seemed to make. Luca fell
into a thornbush that cracked loudly, but managed to extract
himself with no more than heavy breathing. Charlin slipped, and
slid halfway to the bottom. But nothing moved below.</p>

<p>Short of the camp Lewin paused, exchanging anxious
looks with his friends, then tiptoed in. His own breath sounded
thunderous in his ears, as loud as the snores coming from one of
the four large mounds. He froze as the rough snorts stopped and one
of the mounds heaved. It settled, the snoring began again, and
Lewin let himself breathe.</p>

<p>Carefully he crouched beside one of the smaller heaps
and flipped aside a rough woolen blanket stiff with dirt. Maigran
stared up at him, face bruised and swollen, her dress torn to
little better than rags. He clapped a hand over her mouth to keep
her from crying out, but she only continued to stare blankly, not
even blinking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to carve you like a pig, boy.&rdquo; One of the
larger mounds tumbled aside, and a wild-bearded man in filthy
clothes got to his feet, the long knife in his hand glittering
dully in the moonlight, picking up the red glow of the coals. He
kicked the mounds to either side of him, producing grunts and
stirrings. &ldquo;Just like a pig. Can you squeal, boy, or do you people
just run?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run,&rdquo; Lewin said, but his sister only stared dully.
Frantic, he seized her shoulders, pulled to try starting her toward
where the others were waiting. &ldquo;Run!&rdquo; She came out of the blankets
stiffly, almost a dead weight. Colline was awake&mdash;he could
hear her whimpering&mdash;but she seemed to be drawing her dirty
blankets around her even more tightly, trying to hide in them.
Maigran stood there, staring at nothing, seeing nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems you cannot even do that.&rdquo; Grinning, the man
was coming around the fire, his knife held low. The others were
sitting up in their blankets now, laughing, watching the fun.</p>

<p>Lewin did not know what to do. He could not leave his
sister. All he could do was die. Maybe that would give Maigran a
chance to run. &ldquo;Run, Maigran! Please run!&rdquo; She did not move. She
did not even seem to hear him. What had they done to her?</p>

<p>The bearded man came closer, taking his time,
chuckling, enjoying his slow advance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nooooooooooooooo!&rdquo; Charlin came hurtling out of the
night, throwing his arms around the man with the knife, carrying
him to the ground. The other men bounded to their feet. One, his
head shaved and shining in the pale light, raised a sword to slash
at Charlin.</p>

<p>Lewin was not sure exactly how it happened. Somehow
he had the heavy kettle by its iron handle, swinging; it struck the
shaved head with a loud crunch. The man collapsed as if his bones
had melted. Off balance, Lewin stumbled trying to avoid the fire,
and fell beside it, losing the cookpot. A dark man with his hair in
braids lifted another sword, ready to skewer him. He scrambled away
on his back like a spider, eyes on the sword&rsquo;s sharp point, hands
searching frenziedly for something to fend the man off, a stick,
anything. His palm fell on rounded wood. He jerked it around,
pushed it at the snarling man. The man&rsquo;s dark eyes widened, the
sword dropped from his grasp; blood poured from his mouth. Not a
stick. A spear.</p>

<p>Lewin&rsquo;s hands sprang away from the haft as soon as he
realized what it was. Too late. He crawled backward to avoid the
man as he fell, stared at him, trembling. A dead man. A man he had
killed. The wind felt very cold.</p>

<p>After a time it came to him to wonder why one of the
others had not killed him. He was surprised to see the rest of his
friends there around the coals. Gearan and Luca and Alijha, all
panting and wild eyed above their dustveils. Colline still emitted
soft sniffling sobs from beneath her blankets, and Maigran still
stood staring. Charlin was huddled on his knees, holding himself.
And the four men, the villagers&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Lewin stared from one
motionless bloody shape to another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;killed them.&rdquo; Luca&rsquo;s voice shook. &ldquo;We&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Mercy of the Light, be with us now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lewin crawled to Charlin and touched his shoulder.
&ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Charlin fell over. Red wetness slicked his hands,
gripping the hilt of the knife driven into his belly. &ldquo;It hurts,
Lewin,&rdquo; he whispered. He shuddered once, and the light went out of
his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are we going to do?&rdquo; Gearan asked. &ldquo;Charlin is
dead, and we&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Light, what have we done? What do we do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will take the girls back to the wagons.&rdquo; Lewin
could not pull his eyes away from Charlin&rsquo;s glazed stare. &ldquo;We will
do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They gathered up everything that was useful, the
cookpot and the knives, mainly. Metal things were hard to come by.
&ldquo;We might as well,&rdquo; Alijha said roughly. &ldquo;They certainly stole it
from someone just like us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Alijha started to pick up one of the swords,
though, Lewin stopped him. &ldquo;No, Alijha. That is a weapon, made to
kill people. It has no other use.&rdquo; Alijha said nothing, only ran
his eyes over the four dead bodies, looked at the spears Luca was
winding with blankets to carry Charlin&rsquo;s body on. Lewin refused to
look at the villagers. &ldquo;A spear can put food in the pots, Alijha. A
sword cannot. It is forbidden by the Way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alijha was still silent, but Lewin thought he sneered
behind his dustveil. Yet when they finally started away into the
night, the swords remained by the dying coals and the dead men.</p>

<p>It was a long walk back through the darkness,
carrying the makeshift stretcher bearing Charlin, the wind
sometimes gusting to raise choking clouds of dust. Maigran stumbled
along, staring straight ahead; she did not know where she was, or
who they were. Colline seemed half terrified, even of her own
brother, jumping if anyone touched her. This was not how Lewin had
imagined their return. In his mind the girls had been laughing,
happy to return to the wagons; they had all been laughing. Not
carrying Charlin&rsquo;s corpse. Not hushed by the memory of what they
had done.</p>

<p>The lights of the cook fires came into view, and then
the wagons, harnesses already spread for men to take their places
at sunrise. No one left the shelter of the wagons after dark, so it
surprised Lewin to see three shapes come hurrying toward them.
Adan&rsquo;s white hair stood out in the night. The other two were
Nerrine, Colline&rsquo;s mother, and Saralin, his and Maigran&rsquo;s. Lewin
lowered his dustveil with foreboding.</p>

<p>The women rushed to their daughters with comforting
arms and soft murmurs. Colline sank into her mother&rsquo;s embrace with
a welcoming sigh; Maigran hardly appeared to notice Saralin, who
looked close to tears at the bruises on her daughter&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>Adan frowned at the young men, permanent creases of
worry deepening in his face. &ldquo;In the name of the Light, what
happened? When we found you were gone, too&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He trailed off
when he saw the stretcher holding Charlin. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; he
asked again, as if dreading the answer.</p>

<p>Lewin opened his mouth slowly, but Maigran spoke
first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They killed them.&rdquo; She was staring at something in
the distance, her voice as simple as a child&rsquo;s. &ldquo;The bad men hurt
us. They&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Then Lewin came and killed them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not say things like that, child,&rdquo; Saralin
said soothingly. &ldquo;You&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped, peering into her
daughter&rsquo;s eyes, then turned to stare uncertainly at Lewin. &ldquo;Is it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Is it true?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had to,&rdquo; Alijha said in a pained voice. &ldquo;They
tried to kill us. They did kill Charlin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adan stepped back. &ldquo;You&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;killed? Killed <em>
men</em>? What of the Covenant? We harm no one. No one! There is no
reason good enough to justify killing another human being.
None!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They took Maigran, greatfather,&rdquo; Lewin said. &ldquo;They
took Maigran and Colline, and hurt them. They&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no reason!&rdquo; Adan roared, shaking with rage.
&ldquo;We must accept what comes. Our sufferings are sent to test our
faithfulness. We accept and endure! We do not murder! You have not
strayed from the Way, you have abandoned it. You
are Da&rsquo;shain no longer. You are corrupt, and I will not have the
Aiel corrupted by you. Leave us, strangers. Killers! You are not
welcome in the wagons of the Aiel.&rdquo; He turned his back and strode
away as if they no longer existed. Saralin and Nerrine started
after him, guiding the girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother?&rdquo; Lewin said, and flinched when she looked
back at him with cold eyes. &ldquo;Mother, please &rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you that addresses me so? Hide your face
from me, stranger. I had a son, once, with a face like that. I do
not wish to see it on a killer.&rdquo; And she led Maigran after the
others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am still Aiel,&rdquo; Lewin shouted, but they did not
look back. He thought he heard Luca crying. The wind rose, picking
up dust, and he veiled his face. &ldquo;I am Aiel!&rdquo;</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Wildly darting lights bored into Rand&rsquo;s eyes. The
pain of Lewin&rsquo;s loss still clung to him, and his mind tumbled
furiously. Lewin had not carried a weapon. He had not known how to
use a weapon. Killing terrified him. It did not make sense.</p>

<p>He was almost abreast of Muradin now, but the man was
not aware of him. Muradin&rsquo;s snarl was a rictus; sweat beaded on his
face; he quivered as though wanting to run.</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s feet took him forward, and back.</p>
