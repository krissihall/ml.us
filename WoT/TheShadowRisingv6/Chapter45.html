<h4><em>The Tinker&rsquo;s Sword</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">G</span>alloping
through the village with Faile at his
heels, Perrin found the men on the south side in a cluster, peering
out over the cleared fields and muttering, some with bows
half-drawn. Two wagons blocked the gap the Old Road made in the
sharp stakes. The nearest low stone fence still standing, bordering
a field of tabac, lay five hundred paces off, with nothing between
taller than barley stubble; the ground short of it sprouted arrows
like weeds. Smoke curled up in the far distance, a dozen or more
thick black plumes, some wide enough to be fields burning.</p>

<p>Cenn Buie was there, and Hari and Darl Coplin. Bili
Congar had an arm around the shoulders of his cousin Wit, Daise&rsquo;s
bony husband, who looked as if he wished Bili would not breathe on
him. None smelled of fear, only excitement. And Bili of ale. At
least ten men at once tried to tell him what had happened; some
were louder than others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Trollocs tried us here, as well,&rdquo; Hari Coplin
shouted, &ldquo;but we showed them, didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; There were murmurs of
agreement, but just as many or more eyed each other doubtfully and
shifted their feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve some heroes here, too,&rdquo; Darl said in a loud,
rough voice. &ldquo;Your lot up at the wood aren&rsquo;t the only ones.&rdquo; A
bigger man than his brother, he had that same weasel-narrow Coplin
face, the same tight mouth as if he had just bitten a green
persimmon. When he thought Perrin was not looking, he shot him a
spiteful look. It did not necessarily mean he really wished he had
been up facing the Westwood; Darl and Hari and most of their
relatives usually found a way to see themselves being cheated,
whatever the situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This calls for a drink!&rdquo; old Bili announced, then
scowled in disappointment when no one echoed him.</p>

<p>A head lifted above the distant wall and hurriedly
ducked back down, but not before Perrin saw a brilliant yellow
coat. &ldquo;Not Trollocs,&rdquo; he growled disgustedly. &ldquo;Tinkers! You were
shooting at Tuatha&rsquo;an. Get those wagons out of the way.&rdquo; Standing
in his stirrups, he cupped hands to his mouth. &ldquo;You can come on!&rdquo;
he shouted. &ldquo;It is all right! No one will hurt you! I said move
those wagons,&rdquo; he snapped at the men standing around staring at
him. Taking Tinkers for Trollocs! &ldquo;And go fetch your arrows; you&rsquo;ll
have real need for them sooner or later.&rdquo; Slowly some moved to
obey, and he shouted again, &ldquo;No one will harm you! It is all right!
Come on!&rdquo; The wagons rolled to either side with the creak of axles
that needed grease.</p>

<p>A few brightly garbed Tuatha&rsquo;an climbed over the
fence, then a few more, and started toward the village in a
hesitant, footsore half-run, seeming almost as afraid of what lay
ahead as whatever lay behind. They huddled together at the sight of
men dashing out from the village, balancing on the edge of turning
back even when the Two Rivers folk trotted by, looking at them
curiously, to begin pulling arrows out of the dirt. Yet they did
stumble on.</p>

<p>Perrin&rsquo;s insides turned to ice. Twenty men and women,
perhaps, some carrying small children, and a handful of older
children running, too, their dazzling colors all torn and stained
with dirt. And some with blood, he saw as they came closer. That
was all. Out of how many in the caravan? There was Raen, at least,
shuffling as though half-dazed and being guided by Ila, one side of
her face a dark, swollen bruise. At least they had survived.</p>

<p>Short of the opening, the Tuatha&rsquo;an stopped, staring
uncertainly at the sharp stakes and the mass of armed men. Some of
the children clutched their elders and hid their faces. They
smelled of fear, of terror. Faile jumped down and ran to them, but
though Ila hugged her, she did not take another step nearer. The
older woman seemed to be drawing comfort from the younger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t hurt you,&rdquo; Perrin said. <em>I should have
made them come. The Light burn me, I should have made them!</em>
&ldquo;You are welcome to our fires.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tinkers.&rdquo; Hari&rsquo;s mouth twisted scornfully. &ldquo;What do
we want with a bunch of thieving Tinkers? Take everything that
isn&rsquo;t nailed down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Darl open his mouth, to support Hari no doubt, but
before he could speak someone in the crowd shouted, &ldquo;So do you,
Hari! And you&rsquo;ll take the nails, too!&rdquo; Sparse laughter snapped
Darl&rsquo;s jaws shut. Not many laughed, though, and those that did eyed
the bedraggled Tuatha&rsquo;an and looked down in discomfort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hari is right!&rdquo; Daise Congar called, bulling
through, pushing men out of her path. &ldquo;Tinkers steal, and not just
things! They steal children!&rdquo; Shoving her way to Cenn Buie, she
shook a finger as thick as Cenn&rsquo;s thumb under his nose. He backed
away as much as he could in the press; she overtopped him by a head
and outweighed him by half. &ldquo;You are supposed to be on the Village
Council, but if you don&rsquo;t want to listen to the Wisdom, I&rsquo;ll bring
the Women&rsquo;s Circle into this, and we will take care of it.&rdquo; Some of
the men nodded, muttering.</p>

<p>Cenn scratched his thinning hair, eyeing the Wisdom
sideways. &ldquo;Aaah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Perrin,&rdquo; he said slowly in that
scratchy voice, &ldquo;the Tinkers do have a reputation, you know, and&mdash;&rdquo; He cut off, jumping back as Perrin whirled Stepper to face
the Two Rivers folk.</p>

<p>A good many scattered before the dun, but Perrin did
not care. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not turn anyone away,&rdquo; he said in a tight voice.
&ldquo;No one! Or do you mean to send children off for the Trollocs?&rdquo; One
of the Tuatha&rsquo;an children began to cry, a sharp wailing, and he
wished he had not said that, but Cenn&rsquo;s face went red as a beet,
and even Daise looked abashed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we&rsquo;ll take them in,&rdquo; the thatcher said
gruffly. He rounded on Daise, all puffed up like a banty rooster
ready to fight a mastiff. &ldquo;And if you want to bring the Women&rsquo;s
Circle into it, the Village Council will sit the whole lot of you
down sharp! You see if we don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You always were an old fool, Cenn Buie,&rdquo; Daise
snorted. &ldquo;Do you think we&rsquo;d let you send children back out there
for Trollocs?&rdquo; Cenn&rsquo;s jaw worked furiously, but before he could get
a word out Daise put a hand on his narrow chest and thrust him
aside. Donning a smile, she strode out to the Tuatha&rsquo;an and put a
comforting arm around Ila. &ldquo;You just come along with me, and I&rsquo;ll
see you all get hot baths and somewhere to rest. Every house is
crowded, but we&rsquo;ll find places for everyone. Come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marin al&rsquo;Vere came hurrying through the crowd, and
Alsbet Luhhan, Natti Cauthon and Neysa Ayellin and more women,
taking up children or putting arms around Tuatha&rsquo;an women, urging
them along, scolding the Two Rivers men to make way. Not that
anybody was balking, now; it just took a little time for so many to
jostle back and open a path.</p>

<p>Faile gave Perrin an admiring look, but he shook his
head. This was not <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> work; Two Rivers people might
need the right way pointed out to them sometimes, but they could
see it when it was. Even Hari Coplin, watching the Tinkers brought
in, did not look as sour as he had. Well, not quite as sour. There
was no use expecting miracles.</p>

<p>Shambling by, Raen looked up at Perrin dully. &ldquo;The
Way of the Leaf <em>is</em> the right way. All things die in their
appointed time, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He trailed off as if he could not
remember what he had been going to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They came last night,&rdquo; Ila said, mumbling because of
her swollen face. Her eyes were almost as glazed as her husband&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;The dogs might have helped us escape, but the Children killed all
the dogs, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;There was nothing we could do.&rdquo; Behind her,
Aram shivered in his yellow-striped coat, staring at all the armed
men. Most of the Tinker children were crying now.</p>

<p>Perrin frowned at the smoke rising to the south.
Twisting in his saddle, he could make out more to the north and
east. Even if most of those represented houses already abandoned,
the Trollocs had had a busy night. How many would it take to fire
that many farms, even running between and taking no more time than
needed to toss a torch into an empty house or unwatched field?
Maybe as many as they had killed today; What did that say about
Trolloc numbers already in the Two Rivers? It did not seem possible
one band had done it all, burning all those houses and destroying
the Traveling People&rsquo;s caravan, too.</p>

<p>Eyes falling on the Tuatha&rsquo;an being led away, he felt
a stab of embarrassment. They had seen kith and kin killed last
night, and here he was coldly considering numbers. He could hear
some of the Two Rivers men muttering, trying to decide which smoke
represented whose farm. To all of these people those fires meant
real losses, lives to be rebuilt if they could, not just numbers.
He was useless here. Now, while Faile was caught up in helping see
to the Tinkers, was the time for him to be off after Loial and
Gaul.</p>

<p>Master Luhhan, in his blacksmith&rsquo;s vest and long
leather apron, caught Stepper&rsquo;s bridle. &ldquo;Perrin, you have to help
me. The Warders want me to make parts for more of those catapults,
but I&rsquo;ve twenty men clamoring for me to repair bits of armor their
grandfathers&rsquo; fool grandfathers bought from some fool merchants&rsquo;
guards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like to give you a hand,&rdquo; Perrin said, &ldquo;but
I have something else that needs doing. I&rsquo;d likely be rusty,
anyway. I haven&rsquo;t had much work at a forge the last year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light, I didn&rsquo;t mean that. Not for you to work a
hammer.&rdquo; The blacksmith sounded shocked. &ldquo;Every time I send one of
those goose-brains off with a bee in his ear, he&rsquo;s back ten minutes
later with a new argument. I cannot get any work done. They&rsquo;ll
listen to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin doubted it, not if they would not listen to
Master Luhhan. Aside from being on the Village Council, Haral
Luhhan was big enough to pick up nearly any man in the Two Rivers
and toss him out bodily if need be. But he went along to the
makeshift forge Master Luhhan had set up beneath a hastily built,
open-sided shed near the Green. Six men clustered around the anvils
salvaged from the smithy the Whitecloaks had burned, and another
idly pumping the big leather bellows until the blacksmith chased
him away from the long handles with a shout. To Perrin&rsquo;s surprise
they did listen when he told them to go, with no speech to bend men
&lsquo;round a <em>ta&rsquo;veren&rsquo;s</em> will, just a plain statement that
Master Luhhan was busy. Surely the blacksmith could have done as
much himself, but he shook Perrin&rsquo;s hand and thanked him profusely
before setting to work.</p>

<p>Bending down from Stepper&rsquo;s saddle, Perrin caught one
of the men by the shoulder, a bald-headed farmer named Get Eldin,
and asked him to stay and warn off anyone else who tried to bother
Master Luhhan. Get must have been three times his age, but the
leathery, wrinkle-faced man just nodded and took up a station near
where Haral had his hammer ringing on hot iron. Now he could be
off, before Faile turned up.</p>

<p>Before he could as much as turn Stepper, Bran
appeared, spear on his shoulder and steel cap under one stout arm.
&ldquo;Perrin, there has to be a faster way to bring the shepherds and
herdsmen in if we&rsquo;re attacked again. Even sending the fastest
runners in the village, Abell couldn&rsquo;t get half of them back here
before those Trollocs came out of the wood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was easy to solve, a matter of remembering an
old bugle, tarnished nearly black, that Cenn Buie had hanging on
his wall, and settling on a signal of three long blasts that the
farthest shepherd could hear. It did bring up signals for other
things, of course, such as sending everyone to their places if an
attack was expected. Which led to how to know when an attack was
expected. Bain and Chiad and the Warders turned out to be more than
amenable to scouting, but four were hardly enough, so good woodsmen
and trackers had to be found, and provided with horses so they
could reach Emond&rsquo;s Field ahead of any Trollocs they spotted.</p>

<p>After that, Buel Dowtry had to be settled down. The
white-haired old fletcher, with a nose nearly as sharp as a
broadhead point, knew very well that most farmers usually made
their own arrows, but he was adamantly opposed to anyone helping
him here in the village, as if he could keep every quiver filled by
himself. Perrin was not sure how he smoothed Buel&rsquo;s ruffled temper,
but somehow he left the man happily teaching a knot of boys to tie
and glue goose-feather fletchings.</p>

<p>Eward Candwin, the stout cooper, had a different
problem. With so many folks needing water, he had more buckets and
barrels to make than he could hoop in weeks, alone. It did not take
long to find him hands he trusted to chamfer staves at least, but
more people came with questions and problems they seemed to think
only Perrin had the answers for, from where to burn the bodies of
the dead Trollocs to whether it was safe to return to their farms
to save what they could. That last he answered with a firm no
whenever it was asked&mdash;and it was asked more often than any
other, by men and women frowning at the smoke rising in the
countryside&mdash;but most of the time he simply inquired what the
questioner thought was a good solution and told him to do that. It
was seldom he really had to come up with an answer; people knew
what to do, they just had this fool notion they had to ask him.</p>

<p>Dannil and Ban and the others found him and insisted
on riding about at his heels with that banner, as if the big one
over the Green was not bad enough, until he sent them off to guard
the men who had gone back to felling trees along the Westwood. It
seemed that Tam had told them some tale about something called the
Companions, in Illian, soldiers who rode with the general of an
Illianer army and were thrown in wherever the battle was hottest.
Tam, of all people! At least they took the banner with them.
Perrin felt a right fool with that thing trailing after him.</p>

<p>In the middle of the morning, Luc rode in, all
golden-haired arrogance, nodding slightly to acknowledge a few
cheers, though why anyone wanted to cheer him seemed a mystery. He
brought a trophy that he pulled out of a leather bag and had set on
a spear at the edge of the Green for everyone to gawk at. A
Myrddraal&rsquo;s eyeless head. The fellow was modest enough, in a
condescending sort of way, but he did let slip that he had killed
the Fade when he ran into a band of Trollocs. An admiring train
took him around to see the scene of the battle here&mdash;they
were calling it that&mdash;where horses were dragging Trollocs off
to great pyres already sending up pillars of oily black smoke. Luc
was properly admiring in turn, making only one or two criticisms of
how Perrin had disposed his men; that was how the Two Rivers folk
told it, with Perrin lining everybody up and giving orders he
certainly never had.</p>

<p>To Perrin, Luc gave a patronizing smile of approval.
&ldquo;You did very well, my boy. You were lucky, of course, but there is
such a thing as the luck of the beginner, is there not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he went off to his room in the Winespring Inn,
Perrin had the head taken down and buried. Not a thing people
should be staring at, especially the children.</p>

<p>The questions continued as the day wore on, until he
suddenly realized the sun stood straight overhead, he had had
nothing to eat, and his stomach was talking to him in no uncertain
terms. &ldquo;Mistress al&rsquo;Caar,&rdquo; he said wearily to the long-faced woman
at his stirrup, &ldquo;I suppose the children can play anywhere, so long
as somebody watches to make sure they don&rsquo;t go beyond the last
houses. Light, woman, you know that. You certainly know children
better than I do! If you don&rsquo;t, how have you managed to raise four
of your own?&rdquo; Her youngest was six years older than he was!</p>

<p>Nela al&rsquo;Caar frowned and tossed her head,
gray-streaked braid swinging. For a moment he thought she was going
to snap his nose off, talking that way to her. He almost wished she
would, for a change from everybody wanting to know what he thought
should be done. &ldquo;Of course I know children,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I just want
to make sure it&rsquo;s done the way you want. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll do,
then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sighing, he only waited for her to turn away before
reining Stepper around toward the Winespring Inn. Two or three
voices called to him, but he refused to listen. What he wanted
done. What was wrong with these people? Two Rivers folk did not
follow this way. Certainly not Emond&rsquo;s Fielders. They wanted a say
in everything. Arguments in front of the Village Council, arguments
among the Council, had to come to blows before they occasioned
comment. And if the Women&rsquo;s Circle thought they kept their own
affairs more circumspect, there was not a man who did not know the
meaning of tight-jawed women stalking about with their braids all
but bristling like angry cats&rsquo; tails.</p>

<p><em>What I want!</em> he thought angrily. <em>What I
want is something to eat, someplace where no one is jabbering in my
ear</em>. Stepping down in front of the inn, he staggered, and
thought he could add a bed to that short list. Only midday, with
Stepper doing all the work, and he already felt bone-weary. Maybe
Faile had been right after all. Maybe going after Loial and Gaul
really was a bad idea.</p>

<p>When he walked into the common room, Mistress al&rsquo;Vere
took one look at him and all but pushed him into a chair with a
motherly smile. &ldquo;You can just give over handing out orders for a
while,&rdquo; she told him firmly. &ldquo;Emond&rsquo;s Field can very well survive
an hour by itself while you put some food inside you.&rdquo; She bustled
away before he could say Emond&rsquo;s Field could very well survive by
itself without him at all.</p>

<p>The room was almost empty. Natti Cauthon sat at one
table, rolling bandages and adding them to the pile in front of
her, but she also managed to keep an eye on her daughters, across
the room, though both were old enough to be wearing their hair in a
braid. The reason was plain enough. Bode and Eldrin sat on either
side of Aram, coaxing the Tinker to eat. Feeding him, actually, and
wiping his chin, too. From the way they were grinning at the
fellow, Perrin was surprised Natti was not at the table with them,
braids or no. The fellow was good-looking, he supposed; maybe
handsomer than Wil al&rsquo;Seen. Bode and Eldrin certainly seemed to
think so. For his part, Aram smiled back occasionally&mdash;they
were plumply pretty girls; he would have to be blind not to see it,
and Perrin did not think Aram was ever blind to a pretty girl&mdash;but he hardly swallowed without running a wide-eyed gaze
over the spears and polearms against the walls. For a Tuatha&rsquo;an, it
had to be a horrible sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mistress al&rsquo;Vere said you had finally gotten tired
of your saddle,&rdquo; Faile said, popping in through the door to the
kitchen. Startlingly, she wore a long white apron like Marin&rsquo;s; her
sleeves were pushed up above her elbows, and she had flour on her
hands. As if just realizing it, she whipped the apron off, wiping
her hands hastily, and laid it across the back of a chair. &ldquo;I have
never baked anything before,&rdquo; she said, shoving her sleeves down as
she joined him. &ldquo;It is rather fun kneading dough. I might like to
do it again someday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t bake,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;where are we going to
get bread? I don&rsquo;t intend to spend my whole life traveling, buying
meals or eating what I can snare or fetch with bow or sling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She smiled as if he had said something very pleasing,
though he could not for the life of him see what. &ldquo;The cook will
bake, of course. One of her helpers, really, I suppose, but the
cook will oversee it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cook,&rdquo; he mumbled, shaking his head. &ldquo;Or one of
her helpers. Of course. Why didn&rsquo;t I think of that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, Perrin? You look worried. I
don&rsquo;t think the defenses could be any sounder without a fortress
wall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that. Faile, this Perrin Goldeneyes
business is getting out of hand. I do not know who they think I am,
but they keep asking me what to do, asking if it&rsquo;s all right, when
they already know what has to be done, when they could figure it
out with two minutes&rsquo; thought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a long moment she studied his face, those dark,
tilted eyes thoughtful, then said, &ldquo;How many years has it been
since the Queen of Andor ruled here in fact?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Queen of Andor? I don&rsquo;t really know. A hundred
years, maybe. Two hundred. What does that have to do with
anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These people do not remember how to deal with a
queen&mdash;or a king. They are trying to puzzle it out. You must
be patient with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A king?&rdquo; he said weakly. He let his head drop down
onto his arms on the table. &ldquo;Oh, Light!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laughing softly, Faile ruffled his hair. &ldquo;Well,
perhaps not that. I doubt very much that Morgase would approve. A
leader, at least. But she would very definitely approve a man who
brought lands back to her that her throne has not controlled in a
hundred years or more. She would surely make that man a lord.
Perrin of House Aybara, Lord of the Two Rivers. It has a good
sound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do not need any lords in the Two Rivers,&rdquo; he
growled at the oak tabletop. &ldquo;Or kings, or queens. We are free
men!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Free men can have a need to follow someone, too,&rdquo;
she said gently. &ldquo;Most men want to believe in something larger than
themselves, something wider than their own fields. That is why
there are nations, Perrin, and peoples. Even Raen and Ila see
themselves as part of something more than their own caravan. They
have lost their wagons and most of their family and friends, but
other Tuatha&rsquo;an still seek the song, and they will again, too,
because they belong to more than a few wagons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who owns these?&rdquo; Aram asked suddenly.</p>

<p>Perrin raised his head. The young Tinker was on his
feet, staring uneasily at the spears lining the walls. &ldquo;They belong
to anybody who wants one, Aram. Nobody is going to hurt you with
any of them, believe me.&rdquo; He was not sure if Aram did believe, not
the way he began walking slowly around the room with his hands
stuffed into his pockets, eyeing spears and halberds sideways.</p>

<p>Perrin was more than grateful to dig in when Marin
brought him a plate of sliced roast goose, with turnips and peas
and good crusty bread. At least, he would have dug in, if Faile had
not tucked a flower-embroidered napkin under his chin and snatched
the knife and fork out of his hands. She seemed to find it amusing
to feed him the way Bode and Eldrin had been feeding Aram. The
Cauthon girls giggled at him, and Natti and Marin wore little
smiles, too. Perrin did not see what was so funny. He was willing
to indulge Faile, though, even if he could have fed himself more
easily. She kept making him stretch his neck to take what she had
on the fork.</p>

<p>Aram&rsquo;s slow wandering took him around the room three
times before he stopped at the foot of the stairs, staring at the
barrel of ill-assorted swords. Then he reached out and pulled a
sword from the cluster, hefting it awkwardly. The leather-wrapped
hilt was long enough for both of his hands. &ldquo;Can I use this one?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>

<p>Perrin nearly choked.</p>

<p>Alanna appeared at the head of the stairs, with Ila;
the Tuatha&rsquo;an woman looked weary, but the bruise was gone from her
face. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;best thing is sleep,&rdquo; the Aes Sedai was saying. &ldquo;It is
shock to his mind that troubles him most, and I cannot Heal
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ila&rsquo;s eyes fell on her grandson, on what he held, and
she screamed as if that blade had gone into her flesh. &ldquo;No, Aram!
Nooooo!&rdquo; She almost fell in her haste to get down the stairs and
flung herself on Aram, trying to pull his hands from the sword.
&ldquo;No, Aram,&rdquo; she panted breathlessly. &ldquo;You must not. Put it down.
The Way of the Leaf. You must not! The Way of the Leaf! Please,
Aram! Please!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aram danced with her, fending her off clumsily,
trying to hold the sword away from her. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he shouted
angrily. &ldquo;They killed Mother! I saw them! I might have saved her,
if I had had a sword. I could have saved her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words sliced at Perrin&rsquo;s chest. A Tinker with a
sword seemed an unnatural thing, almost enough to make his hackles
stand, but those words&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;His mother. &ldquo;Leave him alone,&rdquo; he
said, more roughly than he intended. &ldquo;Any man has a right to defend
himself, to defend his&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He has a right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aram pushed the sword toward Perrin. &ldquo;Will you teach
me how to use it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how,&rdquo; Perrin told him. &ldquo;You can find
someone, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tears rolled down Ila&rsquo;s contorted face. &ldquo;The Trollocs
took my daughter,&rdquo; she sobbed, her entire body shaking, &ldquo;and all my
grandchildren but one, and now you take him. He is Lost, because of
you, Perrin Aybara. You have become a wolf in your heart, and now
you will make him one, too.&rdquo; Turning, she stumbled back up the
steps, still racked with sobs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could have saved her!&rdquo; Aram called after her.
&ldquo;Grandmother! I could have saved her!&rdquo; She never looked back, and
when she vanished around the corner, he slumped against the
banister, weeping. &ldquo;I could have saved her, grandmother. I could
have&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin realized Bode was crying, too, with her face
in her hands, and the other women were frowning at him as though he
had done something wrong. No, not all of them. Alanna studied him
from the head of the stairs with that unreadable Aes Sedai calm,
and Faile&rsquo;s face was nearly as blank.</p>

<p>Wiping his mouth, he tossed the napkin on the table
and got up. There was still time to tell Aram to put the sword
back, to go ask Ila&rsquo;s pardon. Time to tell him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;what? That
maybe next time he would not be there to watch his loved ones die?
That maybe he could just come back to find their graves?</p>

<p>He put a hand on Aram&rsquo;s shoulder, and the man
flinched, hunching around the sword as if expecting him to take it.
The Tinker&rsquo;s scent carried a wash of emotions, fear and hate and
bone-deep sadness. Lost, Ila had called him. His eyes looked lost.
&ldquo;Wash your face, Aram. Then go find Tam al&rsquo;Thor. Say I ask him to
teach you the sword.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slowly the other man raised his face. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he
stammered, scrubbing at the tears on his cheeks with his sleeve.
&ldquo;Thank you. I will never forget this. Never. I swear it.&rdquo; Suddenly
he hoisted the sword to kiss the straight blade; the hilt had a
brass wolfhead for a pommel. &ldquo;I swear. Is that not how it is
done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose it is,&rdquo; Perrin said sadly, wondering why
he should feel sad. The Way of the Leaf was a fine belief, like a
dream of peace, but like the dream it could not last where there
was violence. He did not know of a place without that. A dream for
some other man, some other time. Some other Age perhaps. &ldquo;Go on,
Aram. You have a lot to learn, and there may not be much time.&rdquo;
Still bubbling thanks, the Tinker did not wait to wash his tears
away, but ran straight out of the inn, carrying the sword upright
before him in both hands.</p>

<p>Conscious of Eldrin&rsquo;s scowl and Marin&rsquo;s fists on her
hips and Natti&rsquo;s frown, not to mention Bode&rsquo;s weeping, Perrin
walked back to his chair. Alanna had gone from her place at the top
of the stairs. Faile watched him pick up his knife and fork. &ldquo;You
disapprove?&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;A man has a right to defend himself,
Faile. Even Aram. No one can make him follow the Way of the Leaf if
he doesn&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not like to see you in pain,&rdquo; she said very
softly.</p>

<p>His knife paused in cutting a piece of goose. Pain?
That dream was not for him. &ldquo;I am just tired,&rdquo; he told her, and
smiled. He did not think she believed him.</p>

<p>Before he had time to take a second mouthful, Bran
stuck his head in at the front door. He wore his round steel cap
again. &ldquo;Riders coming from the north, Perrin. A lot of riders, I
think it must be the Whitecloaks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faile darted away as Perrin rose, and by the time he
was outside on Stepper, with the Mayor muttering to himself about
what he meant to say to the Whitecloaks, she came riding her black
mare around the side of the inn. More people were running north
than stayed at their tasks. Perrin was in no particular hurry. The
Children of the Light might well be there to arrest him. They
probably were. He did not mean to go along in chains, but he was
not anxious to ask people to fight Whitecloaks for him. He followed
behind Bran, joining the stream of men and women and children
crossing the Wagon Bridge across the Winespring Water, Stepper&rsquo;s
and Swallow&rsquo;s hooves clattering on the thick planks. A few tall
willows grew here along the water. The bridge was where the North
Road began, than ran to Watch Hill and beyond. Some of the distant
smoke plumes had thinned to wisps as fires burned themselves out.</p>

<p>Where the road left the village, he found a pair of
wagons blocking the road and men gathered behind pointed, slanting
stakes with their bows and spears and such, smelling of excitement,
murmuring to each other and all jammed together to watch what was
coming down the road: a long double column of white-cloaked
horsemen trailing a cloud of dust, conical helmets and burnished
plate-and-mail shining in the afternoon sun, steel-tipped lances
all at the same angle. At their head rode a youngish man,
stiff-backed and stern-faced, who looked vaguely familiar to
Perrin. With the arrival of the Mayor, the murmurs hushed
expectantly. Or maybe it was Perrin&rsquo;s arrival that quieted
them.</p>

<p>Two hundred paces or so from the stakes, the
stern-faced man raised a hand, and the column halted with sharp
orders echoing down the files. He came on with just half a dozen
Whitecloaks for company, running his eyes over the wagons and sharp
stakes and the men behind. His manner would have named him a man of
importance even without the knots of rank beneath the flaring
sunburst on his cloak.</p>

<p>Luc had appeared from somewhere, resplendent on his
shiny black stallion in rich red wool and golden embroidery.
Perhaps it was natural enough that the Whitecloak officer chose to
address himself to Luc, though his dark eyes continued to probe. &ldquo;I
am Dain Bornhald,&rdquo; he announced, reining in, &ldquo;Captain of the
Children of the Light. You have done this for us? I have heard that
Emond&rsquo;s Field is closed to the Children, yes? Truly a village of
the Shadow if it is closed to the Children of the Light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dain Bornhald, not Geofram. A son, perhaps. Not that
it made any difference. Perrin supposed one would try to arrest him
as soon as another. Sure enough, Bornhald&rsquo;s gaze swept past him,
then jerked back. A convulsion seemed to seize the man; one
gauntleted hand darted to his sword, his lips peeled back in a
silent snarl, and for a moment Perrin was sure the man was about to
charge, fling his horse onto the spiky barrier, to reach him. The
man looked as if he bore Perrin a personal hatred. Up close, that
hard face had a touch of slackness to it, a shine in those eyes
that Perrin was used to seeing in Bili Congar&rsquo;s. He thought he
could smell brandy fumes.</p>

<p>The hollow-cheeked man beside Bornhald was more than
familiar. Perrin would never forget those deep-set eyes, like dark
burning coals. Tall and gaunt and hard as an anvil, Jaret Byar
truly did look at him with hate. Whether or not Bornhald was a
zealot, Byar surely was.</p>

<p>Luc apparently had the sense not to try usurping
Bran&rsquo;s place&mdash;indeed, he appeared intent on examining the
white-cloaked column as the dust settled, revealing more Children
stretching up the road&mdash;to Perrin&rsquo;s disgust, though Bran
looked to him&mdash;to the blacksmith&rsquo;s apprentice&mdash;waited
for his nod before answering. He was the <em>Mayor</em>! Bornhald
and Byar plainly took note of the silent exchange.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emond&rsquo;s Field is not precisely closed to you,&rdquo; Bran
said, standing up straight with his spear propped out to one side.
&ldquo;We have decided to defend ourselves, and have this very morning.
If you want to see our work, look there.&rdquo; He pointed toward the
smoke rising from the Trollocs&rsquo; pyres. A sickly-sweet smell of
burning flesh drifted in the air, but no one except Perrin seemed
to notice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have killed a few Trollocs?&rdquo; Bornhald said
contemptuously. &ldquo;Your luck and skill amaze me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than a few!&rdquo; somebody called out of the Two
Rivers crowd. &ldquo;Hundreds!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had a battle!&rdquo; another voice cried, and dozens
more shouted angrily on top of one another</p>

<p>&ldquo;We fought them and won!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where were you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can defend ourselves without any
Whitecloaks!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Two Rivers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Two Rivers and Perrin Goldeneyes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goldeneyes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goldeneyes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leof, who should have been over guarding the
woodsmen, started waving that crimson wolfhead banner.</p>

<p>Bornhald&rsquo;s hot-eyed hate took them all in, but Byar
danced his bay gelding forward with a snarl. &ldquo;Do you farmers think
you know battle?&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;Last night one of your villages was
all but wiped out by Trollocs! Wait until they come at you in
numbers, and you will wish your mother had never kissed your
father!&rdquo; He fell silent at a weary gesture from Bornhald, a
fierce-trained dog obeying his master, but his words had quieted
the Two Rivers people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which village?&rdquo; Bran&rsquo;s voice was dignified and
troubled both. &ldquo;We all know people in Watch Hill, and Deven
Ride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch Hill has not been troubled,&rdquo; Bornhald replied,
&ldquo;and I know nothing of Deven Ride. This morning a rider brought me
word that Taren Ferry hardly exists any longer. If you have friends
there, many people did escape across the river. Across the river.&rdquo;
His face tightened momentarily. &ldquo;I myself lost nearly fifty good
soldiers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The news produced a few queasy murmurs; no one liked
to hear that sort of thing, but on the other hand, no one here knew
anyone in Taren Ferry. Likely none of them had ever been that
far.</p>

<p>Luc pushed his horse forward, the stallion snapping
at Stepper. Perrin reined his own mount tightly before the two
began fighting, but Luc appeared not to notice or care. &ldquo;Taren
Ferry?&rdquo; he said in a flat voice. &ldquo;Trollocs attacked Taren Ferry
last night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bornhald shrugged. &ldquo;I said it, did I not? It seems
that the Trollocs have at last decided to raid the villages. How
providential that you here were warned in time to prepare these
fine defenses.&rdquo; His stare ran over the pointed hedge and the men
behind it before settling on Perrin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was the man called Ordeith at Taren Ferry last
night?&rdquo; Luc asked.</p>

<p>Perrin stared at him. He had not known Luc even knew
of Padan Fain, or the name he used now. But people did talk,
especially when someone they knew as a peddler came back with
authority among Whitecloaks.</p>

<p>Bornhald&rsquo;s reaction was as strange as the question.
His eyes glittered a hate as strong as he had shown for Perrin, but
his face went pale, and he scrubbed at slack lips with the back of
his hand as though he had forgotten he wore steel-backed gauntlets.
&ldquo;You know Ordeith?&rdquo; he said, leaning toward Luc in his saddle.</p>

<p>It was Luc&rsquo;s turn to shrug casually. &ldquo;I have seen him
here and there since coming to the Two Rivers. A
disreputable-looking man, and those who follow him no less. The
sort who might have been careless enough to allow a Trolloc attack
to succeed. Was he there? If so, one can hope he died for his
folly. If not, one hopes you have him here with you, close under
your eye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know where he is,&rdquo; Bornhald snapped. &ldquo;Or
care! I did not come here to talk of Ordeith!&rdquo; His horse pranced
nervously as Bornhald flung out a hand, pointing at Perrin. &ldquo;I
arrest you as a Darkfriend. You will be taken to Amador, and there
tried under the Dome of Truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Byar stared at his Captain in disbelief. Behind the
barrier separating the Whitecloaks from the Two Rivers men, angry
mutters rose, spears and bills were hefted, bows raised. The
farther Whitecloaks began spreading out in a gleaming line under
shouted orders from a fellow as big in his armor as Master Luhhan,
sliding lances into holders along their saddles, unlimbering short
horsebows. At that range they could do little more than cover the
escape of Bornhald and the men with him, if they did indeed manage
an escape, but Bornhald appeared oblivious of any danger, and of
anything at all save Perrin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There will be no arrests,&rdquo; Bran said sharply, &ldquo;We
have decided that. No more arrests without proof of some crime, and
proof <em>we</em> believe. You&rsquo;ll never show me anything to
convince me Perrin is a Darkfriend, so you might as well put your
hand down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He betrayed my father to his death at Falme,&rdquo;
Bornhald shouted. Rage shook him. &ldquo;Betrayed him to Darkfriends and
Tar Valon witches who murdered a thousand of the Children with the
One Power!&rdquo; Byar nodded vigorously.</p>

<p>Some of the Two Rivers folk shifted uncertainly; word
had spread of what Verin and Alanna had done that morning, and the
deeds had grown in spreading. Whatever they thought about Perrin, a
hundred tales of Aes Sedai, almost all wrong, made for easy belief
in Aes Sedai destroying a thousand Whitecloaks. And if they
believed that, they might come to believe the rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I betrayed no one,&rdquo; Perrin said in a loud voice so
everyone could hear. &ldquo;If your father died at Falme, those who
killed him are called the Seanchan. I don&rsquo;t know whether they are
Darkfriends, but I do know they use the One Power in battle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Liar!&rdquo; Spittle flew from Bornhald&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;The
Seanchan are a tale concocted by the White Tower to hide their foul
lies! You are a Darkfriend!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bran shook his head wonderingly, pushing his steel
cap over to one side so he could scratch his fringe of gray hair.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about these&mdash;Seanchan?&mdash;about
these Seanchan. What I do know is that Perrin is no Darkfriend, and
you are not arresting anybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The situation was growing more dangerous by the
minute, Perrin realized. Byar saw it and tugged at Bornhald&rsquo;s arm,
whispering to him, but the Whitecloak captain would not, or perhaps
could not, back away now that he had Perrin in front of his eyes.
Bran and the Two Rivers men had their heels planted, too; they
might not be willing to let the Whitecloaks take him even if he
confessed to everything Bornhald claimed. Unless someone tossed
some water fast, everything was going to explode like a fistful of
dry straw tossed on a forge-fire.</p>

<p>He hated having to think quickly. Loial had the right
of it. Hasty thinking led to people being hurt. But he thought he
saw a way here. &ldquo;Are you willing to hold off my arrest, Bornhald?
Until the Trollocs are done with? I won&rsquo;t be going anywhere before
then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should I hold off?&rdquo; The man was blind with hate.
If he went on, a good many men were going to die, including him
most likely, and he could not see. There was no use pointing it
out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you noticed all the farms burning this
morning?&rdquo; Perrin said instead. He made a sweeping gesture that took
in all the dwindling plumes of smoke. &ldquo;Look around. You said it
yourself. The Trollocs aren&rsquo;t content with raiding a farm or two
each night anymore. They&rsquo;re up to raiding villages. If you try to
make it back to Watch Hill, you may not get there. You were lucky
to come this far. But if you stay here, in Emond&rsquo;s Field&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;
Bran rounded on him, and other men shouted loud noes; Faile rode
close and seized his arm, but he ignored all of them. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;you
will know where I am, and your soldiers will be welcome to help our
defenses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure about this, Perrin?&rdquo; Bran said,
grabbing Stepper&rsquo;s stirrup, while from the other side Faile said
urgently, &ldquo;No, Perrin! It is too great a risk. You must not&mdash;I mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;please don&rsquo;t&mdash;Oh, the Light burn me to bloody
ash! You <em>must</em> not do this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have men fighting men if I can stop it,&rdquo; he
told them firmly. &ldquo;We are not going to do the Trollocs&rsquo; work for
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faile practically flung his arm away. Scowling at
Bornhald, she produced a sharpening stone from her pouch and a
knife from somewhere, and began honing the blade with a silk-soft
<em>whisk-whisk</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hari Coplin won&rsquo;t know what to think, now,&rdquo; Bran
said wryly. Straightening his round helmet, he turned back to the
Whitecloaks and planted his spear butt. &ldquo;You have heard his terms.
Now hear mine. If you come into Emond&rsquo;s Field, you arrest no one
without the say-so of the Village Council, which you will not get,
so you arrest no one. You don&rsquo;t go into anybody&rsquo;s house unless you
are asked. You make no trouble, and you share in the defense where
and when you&rsquo;re asked. And I don&rsquo;t want to so much as <em>
smell</em> a Dragon&rsquo;s Fang! Will you agree? If not, you can ride
back as you came.&rdquo; Byar stared at the round man as if a sheep had
reared up on its hind legs and offered to wrestle.</p>

<p>Bornhald never took his eyes off Perrin. &ldquo;Done,&rdquo; he
said at last. &ldquo;Until the Trolloc threat is gone, done!&rdquo; Wrenching
his horse around, he galloped back toward the line of his men,
snowy cloak billowing behind him.</p>

<p>As the Mayor ordered the wagons rolled aside, Perrin
realized that Luc was looking at him. The fellow sat slumped easily
in his saddle, a languorous hand on his sword hilt, blue eyes
amused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you would object,&rdquo; Perrin said, &ldquo;the way I
hear you&rsquo;ve been talking people up against the Whitecloaks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Luc spread his hands smoothly. &ldquo;If these people want
Whitecloaks among them, let them have Whitecloaks. But you should
be careful, young Goldeneyes. I know something of taking an enemy
into your bosom. His blade goes in quicker when he is close.&rdquo; With
a laugh, he pushed his stallion off through the crowd, back into
the village.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is right,&rdquo; Faile said, still stropping her knife
on the stone. &ldquo;Perhaps this Bornhald will keep his word not to
arrest you, but what is to stop one of his men from putting a blade
in your back? You should not have done this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had to,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;Better than doing the
Trollocs&rsquo; work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Whitecloaks were beginning to ride in, Bornhald
and Byar at their head. Those two glared at him with unabated
hatred, and the others, riding by in pairs&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Cold, hard eyes in
cold, hard faces swung to regard him as they passed. They did not
hate, but they saw a Darkfriend when they saw him. And Byar, at
least, was capable of anything.</p>

<p>He had had to do it, but he thought maybe it would
not be such a bad idea to let Dannil and Ban and the others follow
him around the way they wanted to. He was not going to be able to
sleep easy without somebody guarding his door. Guards. Like some
fool lord. At least Faile would be happy. If only he could make
them lose that banner somewhere.</p>
