<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">W</span>ith
Faile holding his head beneath her breasts,
Perrin lost track of how long he cried. Images of his family
flashed in his thoughts, his father smiling as he showed him how to
hold a bow, his mother singing while she spun wool, Adora and
Deselle teasing him when he shaved the first time, Paet wide-eyed
at a gleeman during Sunday long ago. Pictures of graves, cold and
lonely in a row. He wept until there were no more tears in him.
When he finally pulled back, the two of them were alone except for
Scratch, washing himself atop the ale barrel. He was glad the
others had not remained to watch him. Faile was bad enough. In a
way he was glad she had stayed; he only wished she had not seen or
heard.</p>

<p>Taking his hands in hers, Faile sat in the next
chair. She was so beautiful, with her slightly tilted eyes, large
and dark, and her high cheekbones. He did not know how he was going
to be able to make up to her for the way he had treated her these
last few days. No doubt she would find a means to make him pay for
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you given up the notion of surrendering to the
Whitecloaks?&rdquo; she asked. There was no hint in her voice that she
had just watched him cry like a baby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems it wouldn&rsquo;t do any good. They&rsquo;ll be after
Rand&rsquo;s father, and Mat&rsquo;s, whatever I do. My family&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He
quickly loosened his grip on her hands, but she smiled instead of
wincing. &ldquo;I have to get Master Luhhan and his wife free, if I can.
And Mat&rsquo;s mother and sisters; I promised him I would look after
them. And do what I can about the Trollocs.&rdquo; Maybe this Lord Luc
had some ideas. At least the Waygate was blocked; no more would
come through the Ways. He especially wanted to do something about
the Trollocs. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t manage any of that if I let them hang
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very glad you see that,&rdquo; she told him dryly.
&ldquo;Any more fool notions about sending me away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He braced himself for the storm, but she simply
nodded as if the one word were what she expected and all she
wanted. A small thing, nothing worth arguing over. She was going to
make him pay large.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are five, Perrin, six if Loial is willing. And if
we can find Tam al&rsquo;Thor and Abell Cauthon&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Are they as good
with a bow as you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better,&rdquo; he said truthfully. &ldquo;Much better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave him a slight, disbelieving nod. &ldquo;That will
make eight. A beginning. Maybe others will join us. And then
there&rsquo;s Lord Luc. He will probably want to take charge, but if he&rsquo;s
not a crackbrain, it won&rsquo;t matter. Not everyone who took the
Hunter&rsquo;s Oath is sensible, though. I&rsquo;ve met some who think they
know everything, and are stubborn as mules besides.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; She looked at him sharply, and he managed
to keep the smile off his face. &ldquo;That you&rsquo;ve met some like that, I
mean. I saw a pair of them once, remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, them. Well, we can hope Lord Luc is not a
boasting liar.&rdquo; Her eyes became intent, and her grip tightened on
his hands, not uncomfortably, but as though she was trying to add
her strength to his. &ldquo;You will want to visit your family&rsquo;s farm,
your home. I will come with you, if you will let me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I can, Faile.&rdquo; Not now, though. Not yet. If he
looked at those graves below the apple trees now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;It was
strange. He had always taken his own strength for granted, and now
it turned out that he was not strong at all. Well, he was done with
weeping like a babe. It was past time to be doing something. &ldquo;First
things first. Finding Tam and Abell, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master al&rsquo;Vere put his head into the common room, and
came the rest of the way when he saw them sitting apart. &ldquo;There is
an Ogier in the kitchen,&rdquo; he told Perrin with a bemused look. &ldquo;An
Ogier. Drinking tea. The biggest cup looks&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He held two
fingers as though gripping a thimble. &ldquo;Maybe Marin could pretend
Aiel walk in here every day, but she nearly fainted when she saw
this Loial. I gave her a double tot of brandy, and she tossed it
down like water. Nearly coughed herself to death; she doesn&rsquo;t take
more than wine, usually. I think she&rsquo;d have drunk another, if I&rsquo;d
given it to her.&rdquo; He pursed his lips and affected an interest in a
nonexistent spot on his long white apron. &ldquo;Are you all right now,
my boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, sir,&rdquo; Perrin said hastily. &ldquo;Master
al&rsquo;Vere, we cannot remain here much longer. Someone might tell the
Whitecloaks you sheltered me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, there are not many would do that. Not all the
Coplins, and not some of the Congars, even.&rdquo; But he did not suggest
they stay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know where I can find Master al&rsquo;Thor and
Master Cauthon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the Westwood somewhere, usually,&rdquo; Bran said
slowly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I know for sure. They move about.&rdquo; Locking his
fingers over his broad belly, he tilted his gray fringed head to
one side. &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t leaving are you? Well. I told Marin you would
not, but she doesn&rsquo;t believe me. She thinks it best for you to go
away&mdash;best for you&mdash;and like most women she&rsquo;s sure you
will see things her way if she talks long enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Master al&rsquo;Vere,&rdquo; Faile said sweetly, &ldquo;I for one
have always found men to be sensible creatures who only need to be
shown the wisest path once to choose it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Mayor favored her with an amused smile. &ldquo;You will
be talking Perrin into going then, I take it? Marin&rsquo;s right; that
is wisest, if he wants to avoid a noose. The only reason to stay is
that sometimes a man can&rsquo;t run. No? Well, no doubt you know best.&rdquo;
He ignored her sour look. &ldquo;Come along, my boy. Let&rsquo;s tell Marin the
good news. Set your teeth and hold on to your intentions, because
she won&rsquo;t give up trying to shift you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the kitchen, Loial and the Aiel were cross-legged
on the floor. There was certainly no chair in the inn big enough
for the Ogier. He sat with an arm resting on the kitchen table,
tall enough sitting to look Marin al&rsquo;Vere in the eye. Bran had
exaggerated the smallness of the cup in Loial&rsquo;s hands, though on
second glance Perrin saw it was a white-glazed soup bowl.</p>

<p>Mistress al&rsquo;Vere was still doing her best to pretend
Aiel and Ogier were normal, bustling about with a tray of bread and
cheese and pickles, making sure everyone ate, but her eyes did
widen each time they landed on Loial, though he tried to put her at
ease with compliments for her baking. His tufted ears twitched
nervously whenever she looked at him, and she gave a little jump
every time they did, then shook her head, the thick graying braid
swaying vigorously. Given a few hours, they might send each other
to bed with the shakes.</p>

<p>Loial heaved a deep bass sigh of relief at the sight
of Perrin and set his cup&mdash;bowl&mdash;of tea on the table,
but the next instant his broad face sagged sadly. &ldquo;I am sorry to
hear your loss, Perrin. I share your grief. Mistress al&rsquo;Vere&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;
His ears twitched wildly even without looking at her, and she gave
another start. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;has been telling me you will go, now there&rsquo;s
nothing to keep you here. If you wish it, I will sing to the apple
trees before we leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bran and Marin exchanged startled looks, and the
Mayor actually reamed at his ear with a finger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Loial. I will appreciate that, when
there&rsquo;s time. But I have work to do before I can go.&rdquo; Mistress
al&rsquo;Vere set the tray on the table with a sharp click and stared at
him, but he kept on, laying out his plans, such as they were: Find
Tam and Abell, and rescue the people the Whitecloaks held. He did
not mention Trollocs, though he had vague plans there, too. Perhaps
not so vague. He did not mean to leave while there was a Trolloc or
Myrddraal alive in the Two Rivers. He fastened his thumbs behind
his belt to keep from caressing his axe. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be easy,&rdquo; he
finished. &ldquo;I will appreciate your company, but I will understand if
you want to go. This isn&rsquo;t your fight, and you have seen enough
trouble through staying close to Emond&rsquo;s Field folk. And you won&rsquo;t
write much of your book here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here or there, it is the same fight, I think,&rdquo; Loial
replied. &ldquo;The book can wait. Perhaps I will have a chapter about
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said I would come with you,&rdquo; Gaul put in without
being asked. &ldquo;I did not mean until the journey grew hard. I owe you
blood debt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bain and Chiad looked questioningly at Faile, and
when she nodded, added their decisions to remain, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stubborn foolish,&rdquo; Mistress al&rsquo;Vere said, &ldquo;the lot
of you. Very likely you will all end up on gallows, if you live
that long. You know that, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; When they only looked at her,
she untied her apron and lifted it over her head. &ldquo;Well, if you are
foolish enough to stay, I suppose I had better show you where to
hide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her husband looked surprised at her sudden surrender,
but he recovered quickly. &ldquo;I thought perhaps the old sickhouse,
Marin. No one ever goes there now, and I think it still has most of
its roof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What was still called the new sickhouse, where people
were taken to be tended if their illness was contagious, had stood
east of the village, beyond Master Thane&rsquo;s mill, since Perrin was a
small boy. The old one, in the Westwood, had been all but destroyed
in a fierce windstorm back then. Perrin remembered it as half-covered
by vines and briars, with birds roosting in what was left
of the thatch and a badger&rsquo;s den under the back steps. It would be
a good place to hide.</p>

<p>Mistress al&rsquo;Vere gave Bran a sharp look, as though
startled he had thought of it. &ldquo;That will do, I suppose. For
tonight, at least. That is where I will take them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No need for you to do it, Marin. I can lead them
easy enough, if Perrin doesn&rsquo;t remember the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes you forget you&rsquo;re the Mayor, Bran. You
attract eyes; people wonder where you&rsquo;re going and what you are up
to. Why don&rsquo;t you stay here, and if anyone drops by, see they go
away thinking everything is just as it should be. There&rsquo;s mutton
stew in the kettle, and lentil soup that just needs heating. Now
don&rsquo;t mention the sickhouse to anyone, Bran. Best if no one even
remembers it exists.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not a fool, Marin,&rdquo; he said stiffly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you aren&rsquo;t, dear.&rdquo; She patted her husband&rsquo;s
cheek, but her fond look tightened as it shifted from Bran to the
rest of them. &ldquo;You do cause trouble,&rdquo; she muttered before handing
out instructions.</p>

<p>They were to travel in smaller parties so as not to
attract attention. She would cross the village by herself and meet
them in the woods on the other side. The Aiel assured her they
could find the lightning-split oak she described, and slipped out
by the back door. Perrin knew it, a huge tree, a mile beyond the
edge of the village, that looked as if it had been cleft down the
middle by an axe yet somehow continued to live and even flourish.
He was sure he could go straight to the sickhouse itself with no
trouble, but Mistress al&rsquo;Vere insisted everyone meet at the
oak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go wandering about by yourself, Perrin, and the
Light knows what you might stumble into.&rdquo; She looked up at Loial&mdash;standing now, his shaggy hair brushing the ceiling beams and
sighed. &ldquo;I do wish there was something we could do about your
height, Master Loial. I know it is hot, but would you mind wearing
your cloak, with the hood up? Even these days most people will soon
convince themselves they didn&rsquo;t see what they saw if it isn&rsquo;t what
they expect, but if they catch a glimpse of your face&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Not
that you aren&rsquo;t quite handsome, I&rsquo;m sure, but you&rsquo;ll never pass for
Two Rivers folk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial&rsquo;s smile split his face in two beneath his wide
snout of a nose. &ldquo;The day doesn&rsquo;t seem too warm for a cloak at all,
Mistress al&rsquo;Vere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fetching a light, knit shawl with blue fringe, she
accompanied Perrin, Faile and Loial out to the stableyard to see
them off, and for a moment it appeared all their efforts at secrecy
were doomed. Cenn Buie, looking made from gnarled old roots, was
examining the horses with beady eyes. Especially Loial&rsquo;s tall
horse, as big as one of Bran&rsquo;s Dhurrans. Cenn scratched his head,
staring at the great saddle on the big horse.</p>

<p>Those eyes widened when they caught sight of Loial,
and Cenn&rsquo;s jaw flapped. &ldquo;Tr&mdash;Tr&mdash;Trolloc!&rdquo; he managed to
get out at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be an old fool, Cenn Buie,&rdquo; Marin said firmly,
stepping off to one side to pull the thatcher&rsquo;s attention with her.
Perrin kept his head down, studying his bow, and did not move.
&ldquo;Would I be standing on my own back doorstep with a Trolloc?&rdquo; She
gave a contemptuous sniff. &ldquo;Master Loial is an Ogier, as you would
know if you weren&rsquo;t a cantankerous goose who would rather complain
than look at what&rsquo;s under his nose. Passing through, and with no
time to be bothered by the likes of you. You be on about your
business and leave our guests some peace. You know very well that
Corin Ayellin has been after you for months about the poor work you
did on her roof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cenn mouthed the word &ldquo;Ogier,&rdquo; silent and blinking.
For a moment it seemed he might rouse himself in defense of his
handiwork, but then his gaze shifted to Perrin and narrowed. &ldquo;Him!
It&rsquo;s him! They&rsquo;re after you, you young whelp, rapscallion, running
off with Aes Sedai and becoming a Darkfriend. That was when we had
Trollocs before. Now you&rsquo;re back, and so are they. You going to
tell me that&rsquo;s coincidence? What&rsquo;s wrong with your eyes? You sick?
You have some kind of sickness from off you&rsquo;ve brought back to kill
us all, as if Trollocs are not enough? The Children of the Light
will settle you. See if they don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin sensed Faile tensing, and hastily put a hand
on her arm when he realized she was drawing a knife. What did she
think she was doing? Cenn was an irascible old fool, but that was
no reason for knives. She gave an exasperated toss of her head, but
at least she left it at that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is enough, Cenn,&rdquo; Marin said sharply. &ldquo;You keep
this to yourself. Or have you started running to the Whitecloaks
with tales, like Hari and his brother Darl? I&rsquo;ve my suspicions why
the Whitecloaks came rummaging through Bran&rsquo;s books. They took six
off with them, and lectured Bran under his own roof about
blasphemy. Blasphemy, of all things! Because they didn&rsquo;t agree with
what was in a book. You&rsquo;re lucky I don&rsquo;t make you replace those
books for him. They burrowed through the whole inn like weasels.
Hunting for more blasphemous writings, they said, as if anyone
would hide a book. Tumbled all the mattresses from the beds, upset
my linen closets. You are lucky I didn&rsquo;t come haul you back here to
put it all to rights again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cenn drew in on himself a little more with each
sentence, until he looked to be trying to pull his bony shoulders
over his head. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell them anything, Marin,&rdquo; he protested.
&ldquo;Just because a man mentions&mdash;That is, I just happened to
say, just in passing&mdash;&rdquo; He shook himself, still avoiding her
eye but regaining some of his old manner. &ldquo;I mean to take this up
with the Council, Marin. Him, I mean.&rdquo; He pointed a gnarled finger
at Perrin. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all in danger as long as he&rsquo;s here. If the
Children find out you&rsquo;re sheltering him, they might blame the rest
of us. Upset closets won&rsquo;t be in it, then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Women&rsquo;s Circle business.&rdquo; Marin rewrapped
her shawl about her shoulders and moved to stand eye to eye with
the thatcher. He was a little taller than she, but her sudden air
of grave formality gave her the edge. He spluttered, but she rode
right over his attempts to slide a word in. &ldquo;Circle business, Cenn
Buie. If you think it isn&rsquo;t&mdash;if you even dare think of calling me a
liar&mdash;you go flapping your tongue. You breathe a word of Women&rsquo;s
Circle business to anyone, including the Village Council&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Circle has no right interfering in Council
affairs,&rdquo; he shouted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and see if your wife doesn&rsquo;t have you sleeping
in the barn. And eating what your milk cows leave. You think
Council takes precedence over Circle? I&rsquo;ll send Daise Congar over
to convince you different, if you need convincing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cenn flinched, as well he might. If Daise Congar was
the Wisdom, she would probably force foul-tasting concoctions down
his throat every day for the next year, and Cenn was too scrawny to
stop her. Alsbet Luhhan was the only woman in Emond&rsquo;s Field larger
than Daise, and Daise had a mean streak and a temper to go with it.
Perrin could not imagine her as Wisdom; Nynaeve would probably have
a fit when she found out who had replaced her. Nynaeve had always
believed she used sweet reason, herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No need to get nasty, Marin,&rdquo; Cenn muttered
placatingly. &ldquo;You want me to keep quiet, I&rsquo;ll keep quiet. But
Women&rsquo;s Circle or no, you&rsquo;re risking bringing the Children down on
all of us.&rdquo; Marin merely raised her eyebrows, and after a moment he
slunk away, grumbling under his breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well done,&rdquo; Faile said when Cenn disappeared around
the corner of the inn. &ldquo;I think I need to take lessons from you. I
am not half so good at handling Perrin as you are with Master
al&rsquo;Vere and that fellow.&rdquo; She smiled at Perrin to show she was
joking. At least, he hoped that was what it meant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have to know when to rein them short,&rdquo; the older
woman replied absently, &ldquo;and when there&rsquo;s nothing to do but give
them their head. Letting them have their way when it isn&rsquo;t
important makes it easier to check them when it is.&rdquo; She was
frowning after Cenn, not really paying attention to what she was
saying, except maybe when she added, &ldquo;And some should be tied in
the stall and left there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin leaped in hastily. Faile certainly did not
need any advice of this sort. &ldquo;Will he hold his tongue do you
think, Mistress al&rsquo;Vere?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hesitating, she said, &ldquo;I believe he will. Cenn was
born with a sore tooth that&rsquo;s only gotten worse as he ages, but he
isn&rsquo;t like Hari Coplin or that lot.&rdquo; Still, she had hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had best be moving,&rdquo; he said. No one argued.</p>

<p>The sun was higher than he had expected, past its
midday height already, which meant most people were indoors for
their dinner. The few still out, mainly boys minding sheep or cows,
were busy eating what they had brought with them wrapped up in a
cloth, too absorbed in their food and too far from the cart paths
to pay much mind to anyone passing. Still, Loial earned some stares
despite the deep hood hiding his face. Even on Stepper Perrin came
short of the Ogier&rsquo;s chest on his tall mount. To the people who saw
them from a distance they must have looked like an adult with two
children, all on ponies, leading packponies. Certainly not a usual
sight, but Perrin hoped that was what they thought they saw. Talk
would draw notice. He had to avoid that until he got Mistress
Luhhan and the others free. If only Cenn kept his peace. He kept
the hood of his own cloak up, too. That might also cause talk, but
not as much as if anyone saw his beard and realized he was
definitely not a child. At least the day was not particularly warm.
It almost felt like spring, not summer, after Tear.</p>

<p>He had no trouble finding the split oak, the two
halves leaning apart in a wide fork with the inner surface black
and hardened like iron, the ground beneath the thick spreading
branches clear. Merely crossing the village was much shorter than
going around, so Mistress al&rsquo;Vere was already waiting, shifting her
shawl a trifle impatiently. The Aiel were there, too, squatting on
the mulch of old oak leaves and squirrel chewed acorn hulls, Gaul
apart from the two women. The Maidens and Gaul watched each other
almost as closely as the surrounding woods. Perrin had no doubt
they had managed to reach this spot unobserved. He wished he had
that ability; he could stalk fairly well in the woods, but the Aiel
did not seem to care if it was forest or farmland or city. When
they did not want to be seen, they found a way not to be seen.</p>

<p>Mistress al&rsquo;Vere insisted they go the rest of the way
afoot, claiming the way was too overgrown for riding. Perrin did
not agree, but he dismounted anyway. No doubt it would not be
comfortable leading folk on horseback while on foot. In any case,
his head was full of plans. He needed a look at the Whitecloak camp
up at Watch Hill before deciding how to rescue Mistress Luhhan and
the others. And where were Tam and Abell hiding? Neither Bran nor
Mistress al&rsquo;Vere had said; perhaps they did not know. If Tam and
Abell had not brought the prisoners out already, it was not an easy
task. He had to do it somehow, though. Then he could turn his
attention to Trollocs.</p>

<p>No one from the village had come this way in years,
and the path had vanished, yet tall trees kept the undergrowth down
to a large extent. The Aiel slipped along silently with everyone
else, acceding to Mistress al&rsquo;Vere&rsquo;s insistence that they all stay
together. Loial murmured approvingly at great oaks or particularly
tall fir trees and leatherleaf. Occasionally a mocker or redbreast
sang in the trees, and once Perrin smelled a fox watching them
pass.</p>

<p>Suddenly he caught man scent that had not been there
a moment before, heard a faint rustle. The Aiel tensed, crouching
with spears ready. Perrin reached to his quiver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be at ease,&rdquo; Mistress al&rsquo;Vere said urgently,
motioning for weapons to be lowered. &ldquo;Please, be at ease.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly there were two men standing ahead, one tall
and dark and slender to the left, the other short, stocky and
graying to the right. Both held bows with arrows nocked, ready to
raise and draw, with quivers balancing the swords on their hips.
Both wore cloaks that seemed to fade into the surrounding
foliage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Warders!&rdquo; Perrin exclaimed. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell us
there are Aes Sedai here, Mistress al&rsquo;Vere? Master al&rsquo;Vere never
mentioned it either. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because he doesn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said hurriedly. &ldquo;I did
not lie when I said this is Women&rsquo;s Circle business.&rdquo; She turned
her attention to the two Warders, neither of whom had relaxed an
inch. &ldquo;Tomas, Ihvon, you know me. Put those bows down. You know I&rsquo;d
not bring anyone here if they meant harm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An Ogier,&rdquo; the gray haired man said, &ldquo;Aiel, a
yellow-eyed man&mdash;the one the Whitecloaks seek, of course&mdash;and a fierce young woman with a knife.&rdquo; Perrin glanced at
Faile; she held a blade ready to throw. He agreed with her this
time. These might be Warders, but they showed no sign of lowering
their bows yet; their faces might as well have been carved from
anvils. The Aiel looked ready to begin dancing the spears without
waiting to veil themselves. &ldquo;A strange group, Mistress al&rsquo;Vere,&rdquo;
the older Warder went on. &ldquo;We shall see. Ihvon?&rdquo; The slender man
nodded and melted into the undergrowth; Perrin could barely hear
the fellow&rsquo;s going. Warders moved like death itself when they
wanted to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Women&rsquo;s Circle business?&rdquo; he
demanded. &ldquo;I know Whitecloaks would cause trouble if they knew
about Aes Sedai, so you wouldn&rsquo;t want to tell Hari Coplin, but why
keep it secret from the Mayor? And us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because we agreed to,&rdquo; Mistress al&rsquo;Vere said
irritably. The irritation seemed meant in equal parts for Perrin
and the Warder still guarding them&mdash;there was no other word
for it&mdash;with maybe a bit left over for the Aes Sedai. &ldquo;They
were at Watch Hill when the Whitecloaks came. No one there knew who
they were except the Circle there, who passed them on to us to
hide. From everyone, Perrin. It&rsquo;s the best way to keep a secret, if
only a few know. Light preserve me, I know two women who have
stopped sharing their husbands&rsquo; beds for fear they might talk in
their sleep. We agreed to keep it secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you decide to change that?&rdquo; the gray haired
Warder asked in a hard voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For what I consider good and sufficient reasons,
Tomas.&rdquo; From the way she shifted her shawl, Perrin suspected she
was hoping the Circle&mdash;and the Aes Sedai&mdash;thought so,
too. Rumor had it the Circle could be even harder on each other
than they were on the rest of the village. &ldquo;Where better to hide
you, Perrin, than with Aes Sedai? Surely you aren&rsquo;t afraid of them,
not after leaving here with one. And&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;You will find out soon
enough. You just have to trust me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are Aes Sedai and Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Perrin told her.
But those he considered the worst, the Red Ajah, did not bond
Warders; the Red Ajah did not like men very much at all. This Tomas
had dark unwavering eyes. They might rush him, or better simply
leave, but the Warder would surely put an arrow through the first
one to do something he did not like, and Perrin was ready to bet
the man had more shafts handy for easy nocking. The Aiel seemed to
agree; they still looked ready to spring in any direction at any
moment, but they looked as if they could stand where they were
until the sun froze, too. Perrin patted Faile on the shoulder. &ldquo;It
will be all right,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it will,&rdquo; she replied, smiling. She had
put the knife away. &ldquo;If Mistress al&rsquo;Vere says it, I trust her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin hoped she was right. He did not trust as many
people as he once had. Not Aes Sedai. And maybe not even Marin
al&rsquo;Vere. But maybe these Aes Sedai would help him fight Trollocs.
He would trust anyone who did that. But how far could he rely on
Aes Sedai? They did what they did for their own reasons; the Two
Rivers was home, to him, but to them it might be a stone on a
stones board. Faile and Marin al&rsquo;Vere appeared to be trusting,
though, and the Aiel waited. For the moment, it seemed he had
little choice.</p>
