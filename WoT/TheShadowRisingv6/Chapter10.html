<h4><em>The Stone Stands</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">D</span>ead
Aielmen lay at Rand&rsquo;s feet, tangled with the
bodies of three very ordinary men in very ordinary coats and
breeches. Ordinary-looking men, except that six Aiel, the entire
guard, had been slain, some obviously before they knew what was
happening, and each of those ordinary men had at least two Aiel
spears through him.</p>

<p>That was not the half of it, though. As soon as he
pulled the door open, a roar of battle had washed over him:
shouting, howling, steel clashing on steel among the redstone
columns. The Defenders in the anteroom were fighting for their
lives beneath the gilded lamps, against bulky, black-mailed shapes
head-and-shoulders taller than they, shapes like huge men, but with
heads and faces distorted by horns or feathers, by muzzle or beak
where mouth and nose should be. Trollocs. They strode on paws or
hooves as often as on booted feet, cutting men down with oddly
spiked axes and hooked spears and scythelike swords that curved the
wrong way. And with them, a Myrddraal, like a sleek-moving man with
maggot-white skin in black armor, like death made bloodless
flesh.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the Stone an alarm gong sounded, then
stopped with lethal suddenness. Another took it up, and another, in
brazen tolls.</p>

<p>The Defenders fought, and they still outnumbered the
Trollocs, but there were more men down than Trollocs. Even as
Rand&rsquo;s eyes found them, the Myrddraal tore off half the Tairen
captain&rsquo;s face with one bare hand while the other drove a dead
black blade through a Defender&rsquo;s throat, slipping Defenders&rsquo; spear
thrusts like a snake. The Defenders faced what they had thought
were only travelers&rsquo; tales to frighten children; their nerve was
frayed to snapping. One man who had lost his rimmed helmet threw
down his spear and tried to flee, only to have his head split like
a melon by a Trolloc&rsquo;s massive axe. Yet another man looked at the
Myrddraal and fled screaming. The Myrddraal darted sinuously to
intercept. In a moment the humans would all be running.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fade!&rdquo; Rand shouted. &ldquo;Try me, Fade!&rdquo; The Myrddraal
stopped as if it had never moved, its pale, eyeless face turning to
him. Fear rippled through Rand at that stare, sliding over the
bubble of cold calm that encased him when he held <em>saidin</em>;
in the Borderlands they said, &ldquo;The look of the Eyeless is fear.&rdquo;
Once he had believed Fades rode shadows like horses and disappeared
when they turned sideways. Those old beliefs were not so very far
wrong.</p>

<p>The Myrddraal flowed toward him, and Rand leaped the
dead men in front of the doorway to meet it, his boots skidding on
bloody black marble as he landed. &ldquo;Rally to the Stone!&rdquo; he shouted
as he leaped. &ldquo;The Stone stands!&rdquo; Those were the battle cries he
had heard on the night the Stone had not stood.</p>

<p>He thought he heard a vexed shout of &ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; from the
room he had left, but he had no time for Lanfear or what she might
do. That skid very nearly cost him his life; his red-gold blade
barely turned the Myrddraal&rsquo;s black one as he fought for balance.
&ldquo;Rally to the Stone! The Stone stands!&rdquo; He had to keep the
Defenders together, or face the Myrddraal and twenty Trollocs
alone. &ldquo;The Stone stands!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Stone stands!&rdquo; he heard someone echo him, then
another. &ldquo;The Stone stands!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Fade moved as fluidly as a serpent, the snakelike
illusion heightened by the overlapping plates of black armor down
its chest. Yet not even a blacklance ever struck so quickly. For a
time it was all Rand could do to keep its blade from his own
unarmored flesh. That black metal could make wounds that festered,
almost as hard to Heal as the one that ached in his side now. Each
time dark steel forged in Thakan&rsquo;dar, below the slopes of Shayol
Ghul, met red-gold Power-wrought blade, light flashed like sheet
lightning in the room, a sharp bluish white that hurt the eyes.
&ldquo;You will die this time,&rdquo; the Myrddraal rasped at him in a voice
like the crumbling of dead leaves. &ldquo;I will give your flesh to the
Trollocs and take your women for my own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand fought as coldly as he ever had, and as
desperately. The Fade knew the use of a sword. Then an instant came
when he could strike a blow squarely at the sword itself, not
merely divert it. With a hiss as of ice falling on molten metal the
red-gold blade sheared through the black. His next blow took that
eyeless head from its shoulders; the shock of hacking through bone
shivered up his arms. Inky blood fountained from the stump of its
neck. The thing did not fall, though. Thrashing blindly with its
broken sword, the headless figure stumbled about, striking randomly
at the air.</p>

<p>As the Fade&rsquo;s head fell to roll across the floor, the
remaining Trollocs fell, too, shrieking, kicking, tearing at their
heads with coarse-haired hands. It was a weakness of Myrddraal and
Trollocs. Even Myrddraal did not trust Trollocs, so they often
linked with them in some way Rand did not understand; it apparently
ensured the Trollocs&rsquo; loyalty, but those linked to a Myrddraal did
not survive its death long.</p>

<p>The Defenders still standing, fewer than two dozen,
did not wait. In twos and threes they stabbed each Trolloc
repeatedly with their spears until it stopped moving. Some of them
had the Myrddraal down, but it flailed wildly no matter how much
they stabbed. As the Trollocs fell silent, a few surviving human
wounded could be heard moaning, weeping. There were still more men
littering the floor than Shadowspawn. The black marble was slick
with blood, almost invisible against the dark stone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave it,&rdquo; Rand told the Defenders trying to finish
the Myrddraal. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s dead already. Fades just don&rsquo;t want to admit
they&rsquo;re dead.&rdquo; Lan had told him that, what seemed a long time ago;
he had had proof of it before this. &ldquo;See to the injured.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peering at the headless, thrashing shape, its torso a
tatter of gaping wounds, they shivered and moved back, muttering
about Lurks. That was what they called Fades in Tear, in tales
meant for children. Some began to hunt among the downed humans for
any still alive, pulling aside those who could not stand, helping
those who could to their feet. All too many were left where they
lay. Hasty bandgages ripped from a man&rsquo;s own bloody shirt were the
only comfort that could be offered now.</p>

<p>They no longer looked so pretty as they had, these
Tairens. Their no longer gleaming breast- and backplates bore dents
and scruffs; blood-soaked slashes marred once fine black-and-gold
coats and breeches. Some had no helmets, and more than one leaned
on his spear as if it were the only thing holding him on his feet.
Perhaps it was. They breathed heavily, wild expressions on their
faces, that blend of stark terror and blind numbness that afflicts
men in battle. They stared at Rand uncertainly&mdash;fleeting,
fearful stares&mdash;as if he might have called these creatures
out of the Blight himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wipe those spearpoints,&rdquo; he told them. &ldquo;A Fade&rsquo;s
blood will etch steel like acid if it&rsquo;s left long enough.&rdquo; Most
moved slowly to obey, hesitantly using what was available, the
coatsleeves of their own dead.</p>

<p>The sounds of more fighting drifted through the
corridors, distant shouts, the muted clash of metal. They had
obeyed him twice; it was time to see if they would do more. Turning
his back on them, he started across the anteroom, toward the sounds
of battle. &ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; he ordered. He raised his fire-wrought
blade to remind them of who he was, hoping the reminder did not
bring a spear in his back. It had to be risked. &ldquo;The Stone stands!
For the Stone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment his own hollow footsteps were the only
sound in the columned chamber; then boots began to follow. &ldquo;For the
Stone!&rdquo; a man shouted, and another, &ldquo;For the Stone and the Lord
Dragon!&rdquo; Others took it up. &ldquo;For the Stone and the Lord Dragon!&rdquo;
Quickening to a trot, Rand led his bloodied army of twenty-three
deeper into the Stone.</p>

<p>Where was Lanfear, and what part had she played in
this? He had little time for wondering. Dead men spotted the halls
in pools of their own blood, one here and farther on two or three
more, Defenders, servants, Aiel. Women, too, linen-gowned noble and
wool-clad servant alike struck down as they fled. Trollocs didn&rsquo;t
care whom they killed; they took pleasure in it. Myrddraal were
worse; Halfmen gloried in pain and death.</p>

<p>A little deeper in, the Stone of Tear boiled. Knots
of Trollocs rampaged through the halls, sometimes with a Myrddraal
leading, sometimes alone, battling Aiel or Defenders, cutting down
the unarmed, hunting for more to kill. Rand led his small force at
any Shadowspawn they found, his sword slicing coarse flesh and
black mail with equal ease. Only the Aiel faced a Fade without
flinching. The Aiel and Rand. He passed up Trollocs to reach Fades;
sometimes the Myrddraal took a dozen or two Trollocs with it in
dying, sometimes none.</p>

<p>Some of his Defenders fell and did not rise, but Aiel
joined them, nearly doubling their number. Groups of men broke off
in furious battles that drifted away in shouts and clatter like a
forge gone mad. Other men fell in behind Rand, broke away, were
replaced, till none of those who had started with him remained.
Sometimes he fought alone, or ran down a hallway, empty save for
himself and the dead, following the sounds of distant combat.</p>

<p>Once, with two Defenders, in a colonnade looking down
into a long chamber with many doorways, he saw Moiraine and Lan,
surrounded by Trollocs. The Aes Sedai stood, head high like some
storied queen of battles, and bestial shapes burst into flame
around her&mdash;but only to be replaced by more, dashing in
through this door or that, six or eight at a time. Lan&rsquo;s sword
accounted for those who escaped Moiraine&rsquo;s fire. The Warder had
blood on both sides of his face, yet he flowed through the forms as
coolly as if practicing before a mirror. Then a wolf-snouted
Trolloc thrust a Tairen spear toward Moiraine&rsquo;s back. Lan whirled
as though he had eyes in the back of his head, taking off the
Trolloc&rsquo;s leg at the knee. The Trolloc fell, howling, yet still
managed to thrust spearpoint at Lan just as another clubbed the
Warder awkwardly with the flat of its axe, buckling his knees.</p>

<p>Rand could do nothing, for at that moment five
Trollocs fell upon him and his two companions, all snouts and
boars&rsquo; tusks and rams&rsquo; horns, pushing the humans out of the
colonnade by the sheer weight of their rush. Five Trollocs should
have been able to kill three men without much difficulty, except
that one of the men was Rand, with a sword that treated their mail
like cloth. One of the Defenders died, and the other vanished
chasing after a wounded Trolloc, the lone survivor of the five.
When Rand hurried back to the colonnade, there was a smell of
burned meat from the chamber below, and great burned bodies on its
floor, but no sign of Moiraine or Lan.</p>

<p>That was the way of the contest for the Stone. Or the
contest for Rand&rsquo;s life. Battles sprang up and drifted away from
where they began, or died when one side fell. Not only did men
fight Trollocs and Myrddraal. Men fought men; there were
Darkfriends siding the Shadowspawn, roughly dressed fellows who
looked like former soldiers and tavern brawlers. They seemed as
fearful of the Trollocs as the Tairens did, but they killed as
indiscriminately, where they could. Twice Rand actually saw
Trollocs battling Trollocs. He could only assume the Myrddraal had
lost control of them and their blood-lust had taken over. If they
wanted to slay each other, he left them to it.</p>

<p>Then, alone once more and seeking, he trotted &rsquo;round
a corner and right into three Trollocs, each twice as wide as he
and nearly half again as tall. One of them, with an eagle&rsquo;s hooked
beak thrusting out of an otherwise human face, was hacking an arm
from the corpse of a Tairen noblewoman while the other two watched
eagerly, licking their snouts. Trollocs ate anything, so long as it
was meat. It was an even chance whether he was more surprised or
they were, but he was the first to recover.</p>

<p>The one with the eagle&rsquo;s beak went down, mail and
belly alike opened across. The sword-form called Lizard in the
Thornbush should have done for the other two, but that first fallen
Trolloc, thrashing still, half-kicked his foot out from under him,
and he staggered, his blade only scoring a slice along his target&rsquo;s
mail, right into the path of the second Trolloc as it fell, wolf&rsquo;s
muzzle snapping at nothing. It crushed him to the stone tiles
beneath its bulk, trapping sword arm and sword alike. The one still
standing raised its spiked axe, coming as close to a smile as a
boar&rsquo;s snout and tusks would allow. Rand struggled to move, to
breathe.</p>

<p>A scythe-curved sword split the boar&rsquo;s snout to the
neck.</p>

<p>Wrenching its blade free, a fourth Trolloc bared goat
teeth at him in a snarl, ears twitching beside its horns. Then it
darted away, sharp hooves clicking on the floor tiles.</p>

<p>Rand heaved himself out from under the dead weight of
the Trolloc, half-stunned. <em>A Trolloc saved me. A Trolloc?</em>
Trolloc blood was all over him, thick and dark. Far down the
hallway, in the opposite direction from where the goat-horned
Trolloc had fled, blue-white flashed as two Myrddraal moved into
view. Fighting each other, in an almost boneless blur of continuous
motion. One forced the other into a crossing corridor, and the
flashing light faded from sight. <em>I&rsquo;m mad. That&rsquo;s what it is. I
am mad, and this is all some crazed dream</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You risk everything, rushing about wildly with that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that sword.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand turned to face Lanfear. She had put on the
appearance of a girl again, no older than he, perhaps younger. She
lifted her white skirts to step over the Tairen lady&rsquo;s torn body;
for all the emotion on her face, it might as well have been a
log.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You build a hut of twigs,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;when you
could have marble palaces for the snap of your fingers. You could
have had their lives and such souls as Trollocs possess with little
effort, and instead they nearly killed you. You must learn. Join
with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was this your doing?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;That Trolloc,
saving me? Those Myrddraal? Was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She considered him a moment before giving a slight,
regretful shake of her head. &ldquo;If I take credit, you will expect it
again, and that could be deadly. None of the others is really
certain where I stand, and I like it that way. You can expect no
open aid from me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Expect your aid?&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;You want me to turn
to the Shadow. You can&rsquo;t make me forget what you are with soft
words.&rdquo; He channeled, and she slammed against a wall hanging hard
enough to make her grunt. He held her there, spread-eagled over a
woven hunting scene, feet off the floor and snowy gown spread out
and flattened. How had he blocked Egwene and Elayne? He had to
remember.</p>

<p>Suddenly he flew across the hallway to crash into the
wall opposite Lanfear, pressed there like an insect by
<em>something</em> that barely allowed him to breathe.</p>

<p>Lanfear appeared to have no trouble breathing.
&ldquo;Whatever you can do, Lews Therin, I can do. And better.&rdquo; Pinned
against the wall as she was, she seemed unperturbed. The din of
fighting surged up somewhere nearby, then faded as the battle moved
away. &ldquo;You half-use the smallest fraction of what you are capable
of, and walk away from what would allow you to crush all who come
against you. Where is <em>Callandor</em>, Lews Therin? Still up in
your bedchamber like some useless ornament? Do you think yours is
the only hand that can wield it, now that you have drawn it free?
If Sammael is here, he will take it, and use it against you. Even
Moghedien would take it to deny you its use; she could gain much by
trading it to any male Chosen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He struggled against whatever held him; nothing moved
but his head, flung from side to side. <em>Callandor</em> in the
hands of a male Forsaken. The thought drove him half-mad with fear
and frustration. He channeled, tried to pry at what held him, but
there might as well have been nothing to pry. And then abruptly it
was gone; he lurched away from the wall, still fighting, before he
realized he was free. And from nothing he had done.</p>

<p>He looked at Lanfear. She still hung there, as
complacently as if taking the air on a streamside. She was trying
to lull him, to gull him into softening toward her. He hesitated
over the flows holding her. If he tied them off and left her, she
might tear half the Stone down trying to get free&mdash;if a
passing Trolloc did not kill her, thinking she was one of the
Stone&rsquo;s folk. That should not have troubled him&mdash;not the
death of a Forsaken&mdash;but the thought of leaving a woman, or
anyone, helpless for Trollocs repelled him. A glance at her
unruffled composure rid him of that thought. No one, nothing, in
the Stone would harm her as long as she could channel. If he could
find Moiraine to block her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once more Lanfear took the decision from him. The
impact of severed flows jolted him, and she dropped lightly to the
floor. He stared as she stepped away from the wall, calmly brushing
her skirts. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; he gasped foolishly, and she
smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not have to see a flow to unravel it, if I know
what it is and where. You see, you have much to learn. I like you
like this. You were always too stiff-necked and sure of yourself
for comfort. It was always better when you were a bit uncertain of
your footing. Are you forgetting <em>Callandor</em>, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still he hesitated. One of the Forsaken stood there.
And there was absolutely nothing he could do. Turning, he ran for
<em>Callandor</em>. Her laughter seemed to follow him.</p>

<p>This time he did not turn aside to fight Trollocs or
Myrddraal, did not slow his wild climb through the Stone unless
they got in his way. Then his sword carved of fire sliced a way
through for him. He saw Perrin and Faile, he with axe in hand, she
guarding his back with her knives; the Trollocs seemed as reluctant
to face Perrin&rsquo;s yellow-eyed stare as his axe blade. Rand left them
behind without a second look. If one of the Forsaken took
<em>Callandor</em>, none of them would live to see the sun
rise.</p>

<p>Breathless, he scrambled through the columned
anteroom, leaping the dead still lying there, Defenders and
Trollocs alike, in his haste to reach <em>Callandor</em>. He flung
open both doors. The Sword That Is Not a Sword sat on its gilded
and gem-set stand, shining with the light of the setting sun.
Waiting for him.</p>

<p>Now that he had it in sight, safe, he was almost
loath to touch it. Once, he had used <em>Callandor</em> as it was
truly meant to be used. Only once. He knew what awaited him when he
took it up again, used it to draw on the True Source far beyond
what any human could hold unaided. Letting go the red-gold blade
seemed more than he could do; when it vanished, he almost called it
back.</p>

<p>Feet dragging, he skirted the corpse of the Gray Man
and put his hands slowly on <em>Callandor&rsquo;</em>s hilt. It was cold,
like crystal long in the dark, but it did not feel so smooth that
it would slip in the hand.</p>

<p>Something made him look up. A Fade stood in the
doorway, hesitating, its pale-faced, eyeless gaze on
<em>Callandor</em>.</p>

<p>Rand pulled at <em>saidin</em>. Through
<em>Callandor</em>. The Sword That Is Not a Sword blazed in his
hands, as if he held noonday. The Power filled him, hammering down
like solid thunder. The taint rushed through him in a flood of
blackness. Molten rock pulsed along his veins; the cold inside him
could have frozen the sun. He had to use it, or burst like a rotted
melon.</p>

<p>The Myrddraal turned to flee, and suddenly black
clothes and armor crumpled to the floor, leaving oily motes
floating in the air.</p>

<p>Rand was not even aware he had channeled until it was
done; he could not have said what he had done if his life had
depended upon it. But nothing could threaten his life while he held
<em>Callandor</em>. The Power throbbed in him like the heartbeat of
the world. With <em>Callandor</em> in his hands, he could do
anything. The Power hammered at him, a hammer to crack mountains. A
channeled thread whisked the Myrddraal&rsquo;s drifting remains out into
the anteroom, and its clothes and armor, too; a trickled flow
incinerated both. He strode out to hunt those who had come hunting
him.</p>

<p>Some of them had come as far the anteroom. Another
Fade and a huddle of cowering Trollocs stood before the columns at
the far side staring at ash that sifted out of the air, the last
fragments of the Myrddraal and all its garb. At the sight of Rand
with <em>Callandor</em> flaring in his hands, the Trollocs howled
like beasts. The Fade stood paralyzed with shock. Rand gave them no
chance to run. Maintaining his deliberate pace toward them, he
channeled, and flames roared from the bare, black marble beneath
the Shadowspawn, so hot that he flung up a hand against it. By the
time he reached them, the flames were gone; nothing remained but
dull circles on the marble.</p>

<p>Back down into the Stone he went, and every Trolloc,
every Myrddraal he saw died wreathed in fire. He burned them
fighting Aiel or Tairens, and killing servants trying to defend
themselves with spears or swords snatched from the dead. He burned
them as they ran, whether stalking more victims or fleeing him. He
began to move faster, trotting, then running, past the wounded,
often lying untended, past the dead. It was not enough; he could
not move fast enough. While he killed Trollocs in handfuls, others
still slew, if only to escape.</p>

<p>Suddenly he stopped, surrounded by the dead, in a
wide hallway. He had to do something&mdash;something more. The
Power slid along his bones, pure essence of fire. Something more.
The Power froze his marrow. Something to kill them all; all of them
at once. The taint on <em>saidin</em> rolled over him, a mountain
of rotting filth threatening to bury his soul. Raising
<em>Callandor</em>, he drew on the Source, drew on it till it
seemed he must scream screams of frozen flame. He had to kill them
all.</p>

<p>Just beneath the ceiling, right above his head, air
slowly began to revolve, spinning faster, milling in streaks of red
and black and silver. It roiled and collapsed inward, boiling
harder, whining as it whirled and grew smaller still.</p>

<p>Sweat rolled down Rand&rsquo;s face as he stared up at it.
He had no idea what it was, only that racing flows he could not
begin to count connected him to the mass. It had mass; a weight
growing greater while the <em>thing</em> fell inward on itself.
<em>Callandor</em> flared brighter and brighter, too brilliant to
look at; he closed his eyes, and the light seemed to burn, through
his eyelids. The Power raced through him, a raging torrent that
threatened to carry all that was him into the spinning. He had to
let go. He had to. He forced his eyes open, and it was like looking
at all the thunderstorms in the world compressed to the size of a
Trolloc&rsquo;s head. He had to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;had to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;had to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Now</em>. The thought floated like cackling
laughter on the rim of his awareness. He severed the flows rushing
out of him, leaving the thing still whirling, whining like a drill
on bone. <em>Now</em>.</p>

<p>And the lightnings came, flashing out along the
ceiling left and right like silver streams. A Myrddraal stepped out
of a side corridor, and before it could take a second step half a
dozen flaring streaks stabbed down, blasting it apart. The other
streams flowed on, fanning down every branching of the corridor,
replaced by more and more erupting every second.</p>

<p>Rand had not a clue to what he had made, or how it
worked. He could only stand there, quivering with the Power that
filled him with the need to use it. Even if it destroyed him. He
could feel Trollocs and Myrddraal dying, feel the lightnings strike
and kill. He could kill them everywhere, everywhere in the world.
He knew it. With <em>Callandor</em> he could do anything. And he
knew trying would kill him just as surely.</p>

<p>The lightnings faded and died with the last
Shadowspawn; the spinning mass imploded with a loud clap of
inrushing air. But <em>Callandor</em> still shone like the sun; he
shook with the Power.</p>

<p>Moiraine was there, a dozen paces away, staring at
him. Her dress was neat, every fold of blue silk in place, but
wisps of her hair were disarrayed. She looked tired&mdash;and
shocked. &ldquo;How&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? What you have done, I would not have believed
possible.&rdquo; Lan appeared, half-trotting up the hall, sword in hand,
face bloodied, coat torn. Without taking her eyes from Rand,
Moiraine flung out a hand, halting the Warder short of her. Well
short of Rand. As if he were too dangerous for even Lan to
approach. &ldquo;Are you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well, Rand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand pulled his gaze away from her, and it fell on
the body of a dark-haired girl, little more than a child. She lay
sprawled on her back, eyes wide and fixed on the ceiling, blood
blackening the bosom of her dress. Sadly, he bent to brush strands
of hair from her face. <em>Light, she is only a child. I was too
late. Why didn&rsquo;t I do it sooner? A child!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;I will see that someone takes care of her, Rand,&rdquo;
Moiraine said gently. &ldquo;You cannot help her now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His hand shook so hard on <em>Callandor</em> that he
could barely hold on. &ldquo;With this, I can do anything.&rdquo; His voice was
harsh in his own ears. &ldquo;Anything!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand!&rdquo; Moiraine said urgently.</p>

<p>He would not listen. The Power was in him.
<em>Callandor</em> blazed, and he <em>was</em> the Power. He
channeled, directing flows into the child&rsquo;s body, searching,
trying, fumbling; she lurched to her feet, arms and legs
unnaturally rigid and jerky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand, you cannot do this. Not this!&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Breathe. She has to breathe</em>. The girl&rsquo;s
chest rose and fell. <em>Heart. Has to beat</em>. Blood already
thick and dark oozed from the wound in her chest. <em>Live. Live,
burn you! I didn&rsquo;t mean to be too late</em>. Her eyes stared at
him, filmed. Lifeless. Tears trickled unheeded down his cheeks.
&ldquo;She has to live! Heal her, Moiraine. I don&rsquo;t know how. Heal
her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Death cannot be Healed, Rand. You are not the
Creator.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Staring into those dead eyes, Rand slowly withdrew
the flows. The body fell stiffly. The body. He threw back his head
and howled, as wild as any Trolloc. Braided fire sizzled into walls
and ceiling as he lashed out in frustration and pain.</p>

<p>Sagging, he released <em>saidin</em>, pushed it away;
it was like pushing away a boulder, like pushing away life.
Strength drained out of him with the Power. The taint remained,
though, a stain weighing him down with darkness. He had to ground
<em>Callandor</em> on the floor tiles and lean on it to stay on his
feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The others.&rdquo; It was hard to speak; his throat hurt.
&ldquo;Elayne, Perrin, the rest? Was I too late for them, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were not too late,&rdquo; Moiraine said calmly. But
she had come no closer, and Lan looked ready to dart between her
and Rand. &ldquo;You must not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are they still alive?&rdquo; Rand shouted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are,&rdquo; she assured him.</p>

<p>He nodded in weary relief. He tried not to look at
the girl&rsquo;s body. Three days waiting, so he could enjoy a few stolen
kisses. If he had moved three days ago&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;But he had learned
things in those three days, things he might be able to use if he
could put them together. If. Not too late for his friends, at
least. Not too late for them. &ldquo;How did the Trollocs get in? I don&rsquo;t
think they climbed the walls like Aiel, not with the sun still up.
Is it still up?&rdquo; He shook his head to dispel some of the fog. &ldquo;No
matter. The Trollocs. How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan was the one who answered. &ldquo;Eight large grain
barges tied up at the Stone&rsquo;s docks late this afternoon. Apparently
no one thought to question why laden grain barges would be coming
<em>down</em>river&rdquo;&mdash;his voice was heavy with contempt&mdash;&ldquo;or why they&rsquo;d dock at the Stone, or why the crews left the
hatches shut until nearly sunfall. Also, a train of wagons arrived&mdash;about two hours ago, now&mdash;thirty of them, supposedly
bringing some lord or other&rsquo;s things from the country for his
return to the Stone. When the canvas was thrown back, they were
packed with Halfmen and Trollocs, too. If they came in any other
way, I don&rsquo;t know of it, yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand nodded again, and the effort buckled his knees.
Suddenly Lan was there, pulling Rand&rsquo;s arm over his shoulder to
hold him up. Moiraine took his face in her hands. A chill rippled
through him, not the blasting cold of full Healing, but a chill
that pushed weariness out as it passed. Most of the weariness. A
seed remained, as if he had worked a day hoeing tabac. He moved
away from the support he no longer needed. Lan watched him warily,
to see if he could really stand alone, or perhaps because the
Warder was not certain how dangerous he was, how sane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I left some apurpose,&rdquo; Moiraine told him. &ldquo;You need
to sleep tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sleep. There was too much to do to sleep. But he gave
another nod. He did not want her shadowing him. Yet what he said
was &ldquo;Lanfear was here. This was not her doing. She said so, and I
believe her. You don&rsquo;t seem surprised, Moiraine.&rdquo; Would Lanfear&rsquo;s
offer surprise her? Would anything? &ldquo;Lanfear was here, and I talked
with her. She didn&rsquo;t try to kill me, and I didn&rsquo;t try to kill her.
And you are not surprised.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt you could kill her. Yet.&rdquo; Her glance at
<em>Callandor</em> was the merest flicker of dark eyes. &ldquo;Not
unaided. And I doubt she will try to kill you. Yet. We know little
of any of the Forsaken, and least of all Lanfear, but we do know
she loved Lews Therin Telamon. To say you are safe from her is
certainly too strong&mdash;there is a good deal she can do to harm
you short of murder&mdash;but I do not think she will try to kill
as long as she thinks she might win Lews Therin back again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lanfear wanted him. The Daughter of the Night, used
by mothers who only half-believed in her to frighten children. She
certainly frightened him. It was nearly enough to make him laugh.
He had always felt guilty for looking at any woman besides Egwene,
and Egwene did not want him, but the Daughter-Heir of Andor wanted
to kiss him, at least, and one of the Forsaken claimed to love him.
Nearly enough for laughter, but not quite. Lanfear seemed jealous
of Elayne; that pale-haired milksop, she had called her. Madness.
All madness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow.&rdquo; He started away from them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow?&rdquo; Moiraine said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow, I will tell you what I am going to do.&rdquo;
Some of it, he would. The thought of Moiraine&rsquo;s face if he told her
everything made him want to laugh. If he knew everything himself,
yet. Lanfear had given him almost the last piece, without knowing
it. One more step, tonight. The hand holding <em>Callandor</em> by
his side trembled. With that, he could do anything. <em>I am not
mad yet. Not mad enough for that</em>. &ldquo;Tomorrow. A good night to
us all, the Light willing.&rdquo; Tomorrow he would begin to unleash
another kind of lightning. Another lightning that might save him.
Or kill him. He was not mad yet.</p>
