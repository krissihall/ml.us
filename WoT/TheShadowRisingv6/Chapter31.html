a few minutes Ihvon returned. &ldquo;You can go ahead,
Mistress al&rsquo;Vere&rdquo; was all he said before he and Tomas both vanished
into the brush again without so much as the rustle of a leaf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are very good,&rdquo; Gaul muttered, still staring
around suspiciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A child could hide in this,&rdquo; Chiad told him,
slapping a redberry branch. But she watched the undergrowth as
closely as Gaul did.</p>

<p>None of the Aiel appeared eager to go on. Not
reluctant, precisely, and certainly not afraid, but definitely not
eager. One day Perrin hoped to figure out what it was Aiel did feel
toward Aes Sedai. One day. He was not particularly enthusiastic
himself, today.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go meet these Aes Sedai of yours,&rdquo; he told
Mistress al&rsquo;Vere gruffly.</p>

<p>The old sickhouse was even more ramshackle than he
remembered, a sprawling single story that leaned drunkenly, half
the rooms open to the sky, a forty-foot sourgum tree poking up from
one. The forest closed in on every side. A thick net of vines and
briars snaked up the walls, covered the remaining thatch with
green; he thought they might be all that was holding the building
up. The front door was cleared, though. He smelled horses, and a
faint aroma of beans and ham, but oddly, no woodsmoke.</p>

<p>Tying their animals to low branches, they followed
Mistress al&rsquo;Vere inside, where vine-shrouded windows admitted only
a dim light. The front room was large and bare of furnishings, with
dirt in the corners and a few cobwebs that had escaped an obviously
hasty cleaning. Four blanket rolls were laid out on the floor, with
saddles and saddlebags and neatly tied bundles against the wall,
and a small kettle on the stone hearth gave off the cooking smells
despite the lack of any fire. A smaller kettle seemed to be water
for tea, almost at the boil. Two Aes Sedai awaited them. Marin
al&rsquo;Vere curtsied hastily and launched into an anxious cascade of
introductions and explanations.</p>

<p>Perrin leaned his chin against his bow. He recognized
the Aes Sedai. Verin Mathwin, plump and square-faced, gray
streaking her brown hair despite her smooth-cheeked Aes Sedai
agelessness, was Brown Ajah, and like all Browns seemingly lost
half the time in the search for knowledge, whether old and lost or
new. But sometimes her dark eyes belied that vague dreamy
expression, as now, looking past Marin at him sharp as tacks. She
was one of two Aes Sedai besides Moiraine he was certain knew about
Rand, and he suspected she knew more about himself than she let on.
Her eyes took on that slight vagueness again as she listened to
Marin, but for an instant they had weighed him on scales, factored
him into her own plans. He would have to be very careful around
her.</p>

<p>The other, a dark, slender woman in a deep green silk
riding dress that contrasted sharply with Verin&rsquo;s plain brown,
inkstained at the cuffs, he had never met, and only seen once.
Alanna Mosvani was Green Ajah, if he remembered correctly, a
beautiful woman with long black hair and penetrating dark eyes.
Those eyes sought him, too, while she listened to Marin. Something
Egwene had said came back to him. <em>Some Aes Sedai who shouldn&rsquo;t
know about Rand show too much interest in him. Elaida, for
instance, and Alanna Mosvani. I don&rsquo;t think I trust either of
them</em>. Perhaps it would be best to be guided by Egwene until he
found out differently,</p>

<p>His ears perked up when Marin said, still
apprehensive, &ldquo;You were asking about him, Verin Sedai. Perrin, I
mean. All three boys, but Perrin among them. It seemed the easiest
way to keep him from getting himself killed was to bring him to
you. There just wasn&rsquo;t any time to ask first. Do say you under&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is quite all right, Mistress al&rsquo;Vere,&rdquo; Verin
interrupted in a soothing tone. &ldquo;You did exactly the correct thing.
Perrin is in the right hands, now. Also I will enjoy the chance to
learn more about the Aiel, and it is always a pleasure to talk with
an Ogier. I will pick your brain, Loial. I have found some
fascinating things in Ogier books.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial gave her a pleased smile; anything to do with
books seemed to please him. Gaul, on the other hand, exchanged
guarded looks with Bain and Chiad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all right as long as you do not do it again,&rdquo;
Alanna said firmly. &ldquo;Unless&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;You are alone?&rdquo; she asked Perrin
in a voice that required an answer, and right now. &ldquo;Did the other
two return as well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you here?&rdquo; he demanded right back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perrin!&rdquo; Mistress al&rsquo;Vere said sharply. &ldquo;Mind your
manners! You may have picked up some rough ways out in the world,
but you can just lose them again now that you are home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not trouble yourself,&rdquo; Verin told her. &ldquo;Perrin
and I are old friends now. I understand him.&rdquo; Her dark eyes
glittered at him for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will take care of him.&rdquo; Alanna&rsquo;s cool words
seemed open to interpretation.</p>

<p>Verin smiled and patted Marin&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;You had
better go on back to the village. We don&rsquo;t want anyone wondering
why you are walking in the woods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mistress al&rsquo;Vere nodded. Pausing by Perrin, she put a
hand on his arm. &ldquo;You know you have my sympathy,&rdquo; she said gently.
&ldquo;Just remember that getting yourself killed won&rsquo;t help anything..
Do what the Aes Sedai tell you. &ldquo;He mumbled something
noncommittal, but it seemed to satisfy her.</p>

<p>When Mistress al&rsquo;Vere had gone, Verin said, &ldquo;You have
our sympathy as well, Perrin. If there was anything we could have
done, we would have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not want to think of his family now. &ldquo;You
still haven&rsquo;t answered my question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perrin!&rdquo; Faile managed to copy Mistress al&rsquo;Vere&rsquo;s
tone almost exactly, but he paid it no mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you here? It seems awfully coincidental.
Whitecloaks and Trollocs, and the two of you just happen to be here
at the same time. &rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not coincidental at all,&rdquo; Verin replied. &ldquo;Ah, the
tea water is ready.&rdquo; The water subsided from a boil as she began
to bustle about, tossing a handful of leaves into the kettle,
directing Faile to find metal cups in one of the bundles against
the wall. Alanna, with her arms folded beneath her breasts, never
took her eyes off Perrin, their heat conflicting with the coolness
of her face. &ldquo;Year by year,&rdquo; Verin continued, &ldquo;we find fewer and
fewer girls who can be taught to channel. Sheriam believes we may
have spent the last three thousand years culling the ability out of
humankind by gentling every man who can channel we find. The proof
of it, she says, is how very few men we do find. Why, even a
hundred years ago the records say there were two or three a year,
and five hundred years&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alanna harrumphed. &ldquo;What else can we do, Verin? Let
them go insane? Follow the Whites&rsquo; mad plan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; Verin replied calmly. &ldquo;Even if we
could find women willing to bear children by gentled men, there is
no guarantee the children would be able to channel, or would be
girls. I did suggest that if they wanted to increase the stock, Aes
Sedai should be the ones to have the children; themselves, in fact,
since they put it forward in the first place. Alviarin was not
amused.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She would not be,&rdquo; Alanna laughed. The sudden flash
of delight, breaking her fiery, dark-eyed stare, was startling. &ldquo;I
wish I could have seen her face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her expression was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;interesting,&rdquo; the Brown
sister said musingly. &ldquo;Calm yourself, Perrin. I will give you the
rest of your answer. Tea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trying to wipe the glare from his face, somehow he
found himself seated on the floor, his bow beside him and a metal
cup full of strong tea in his hand. Everyone sat in a circle in the
middle of the room. Alanna took up the explanation of their
presence, perhaps to forestall the other Aes Sedai&rsquo;s tendency to
ramble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here in the Two Rivers, where I suspect no Aes Sedai
had visited in a thousand years, Moiraine found two women who could
not only be taught to channel, but who had the ability born in
them, and heard of another who had died because she could not teach
herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not to mention three <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>,&rdquo; Verin
murmured into her tea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you have any idea,&rdquo; Alanna went on, &ldquo;how many
towns and villages we usually must visit to find three girls with
the ability inborn? The only wonder is that it took us so long to
come hunting more. The old blood is very strong here in the Two
Rivers. We were only in Watch Hill a week before the Children
appeared, and were very careful not to reveal who we were to any
but the Women&rsquo;s Circle there, yet even so we found four girls who
can be trained, and one child I think has the ability inborn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was difficult to be sure,&rdquo; Verin added. &ldquo;She is
only twelve. None have anywhere near the potential of Egwene or
Nynaeve, but the number is still nothing less than remarkable.
There might be another two or three just around Watch Hill. We have
had no chance to examine girls here, or farther south. Taren Ferry
was a disappointment, I must say. Too much interchange of
bloodlines with the outside, I suppose. &rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin had to admit it made sense. But it did not
answer all his questions, or settle all his doubts. He shifted,
stretching out his leg. The spear wound in his thigh hurt. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
understand why you are hiding here. Whitecloaks arresting innocent
people, and here you sit. Trollocs running all over the Two Rivers,
apparently, and here you sit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial muttered under his breath, a muted rumble.
Perrin caught &ldquo;angering Aes Sedai&rdquo; and &ldquo;hornet&rsquo;s nest,&rdquo; but he
continued to hammer at them. &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you doing something?
You&rsquo;re Aes Sedai! Burn me, why aren&rsquo;t you doing something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perrin!&rdquo; Faile hissed before turning an apologetic
smile to Verin and Alanna. &ldquo;Please forgive him. Moiraine Sedai
spoiled him. She has an easy manner, I suppose, and she let him get
away with things. Please don&rsquo;t be angry with him. He will do
better.&rdquo; She shot him a sharp look, indicating she meant that for
his ears as much as theirs, or more. He gave her a piece of his
glower. She had no right interfering in this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An easy manner?&rdquo; Verin said, blinking. &ldquo;Moiraine? I
never noticed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alanna waved Faile to silence. &ldquo;You certainly do not
understand,&rdquo; the Aes Sedai told Perrin in a tight voice. &ldquo;You do
not understand the restrictions under which we labor. The Three
Oaths are not merely words. I brought two Warders with me to this
place.&rdquo; The Greens were the only Ajah to bond more than a single
Warder apiece; a few, he had heard, even had three or four. &ldquo;The
Children caught Owein crossing an open field. I felt every arrow
that struck him until he died. I felt him die. Had I been there, I
could have defended him, and myself, with the Power. But I cannot
use it for revenge. The Oaths do not permit it. The Children are
very nearly as vile as men can be, short of Darkfriends, but they
are not Darkfriends, and for that reason they are safe from the
Power except in self-defense. Stretch that as far as we can, it
will only stretch so far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for Trollocs,&rdquo; Verin added, &ldquo;we have done for a
number of them, and two Myrddraal, but there are limits. Halfmen
can sense channeling, after a fashion. If we manage to draw a
hundred Trollocs down on ourselves, there is very little we can do
except run.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin scratched at his beard. He should have
expected this, should have known. He had seen Moiraine face
Trollocs, and he had some idea of what she could do and what not.
He realized he had been thinking of how Rand had killed all the
Trollocs in the Stone, only Rand was stronger than either of these
Aes Sedai, probably stronger than both together. Well, whether they
helped him or not, he still meant to finish every Trolloc in the
Two Rivers. After he rescued Mat&rsquo;s family, and the Luhhans. If he
thought about it carefully enough, he had to find a way. His thigh
ached miserably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are injured.&rdquo; Setting her cup on the floor,
Alanna came across to kneel beside him and take his head in her
hands. A tingle ran through him. &ldquo;Yes. I see. You did not do this
to yourself shaving, it appears. &rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the Trollocs, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Bain said. &ldquo;When
we came out of the Ways in the mountains.&rdquo; Chiad touched her arm,
and she stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I locked the Waygate, &ldquo;Loial added quickly. &ldquo;No one
will use it until it is opened from this side. &rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought that must be how they were coming,&rdquo; Verin
murmured, half to herself. &ldquo;Moiraine did say they were using the
Ways. Sooner or later that is going to present us with a real
problem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin wondered what she thought that was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Ways,&rdquo; Alanna said, still holding his head.
&ldquo;<em>Ta&rsquo;veren!</em> Young heroes!&rdquo; She made the words sound approving
and close to a curse, both together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not a hero,&rdquo; he told her stolidly. &ldquo;The Ways
were the fastest way to get here. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Green sister went on as if he had not spoken. &ldquo;I
will never understand why the Amyrlin Seat let you three go your
way. Elaida has been having fits over you three, and she is not the
only one, just the most vehement. With the seals weakening and the
Last Battle coming, the last thing we need is three <em>
ta&rsquo;veren</em> running about loose. I would have tied a string to
each of you, even bonded you.&rdquo; He tried to pull back, but she
tightened her grip and smiled. &ldquo;I am not so lost to custom yet as
to bond a man against his will. Not quite yet.&rdquo; He was not sure
how far from it she was; the smile did not reach her eyes. She
fingered the half-healed cut on his cheek. &ldquo;This has gone too long
since it was done. Even Healing will leave a scar now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to be pretty,&rdquo; he muttered&mdash;just
well enough to do what he had to&mdash;and Faile laughed
aloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo; Faile said. Surprisingly, she
shared a smile with Alanna.</p>

<p>Perrin frowned, wondering if they were making fun of
him, but before he could say anything, the Healing hit him, like
being turned to ice. All he could do was gasp. The few moments
before Alanna released him seemed endless.</p>

<p>When he had his breath again, the Green sister had
Bain&rsquo;s flame-haired head between her hands, Verin was seeing to
Gaul, and Chiad was testing her left arm, swinging it back and
forth with a satisfied expression.</p>

<p>Faile took Alanna&rsquo;s place beside Perrin and stroked a
finger across his cheek, along the scar beneath his eye. &ldquo;Beauty
mark,&rdquo; she said, smiling slightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, just something Domani women do. It was just an
idle comment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite her smile, or maybe because of it, he scowled
suspiciously. She <em>was</em> making fun of him, only he did not
understand how, exactly.</p>

<p>Ihvon slipped into the room, whispered in Alanna&rsquo;s
ear, and vanished outside again at her whisper. He hardly made a
sound even on the wooden floor. A few moments later the scrape of
boots on the steps announced new arrivals.</p>

<p>Perrin sprang to his feet as Tam al&rsquo;Thor and Abell
Cauthon appeared in the doorway, bows in hand, with the rumpled
clothes and gray-flecked two-day beards of men who had been
sleeping rough. They had been hunting; four rabbits hung at Tam&rsquo;s
belt, three at Abell&rsquo;s. It was obvious they were expecting the Aes
Sedai, and visitors, too, but they stared in amazement at Loial,
more than half again as tall as either of them, with his tufted
ears and broad snout of a nose. A flicker of recognition crossed
Tam&rsquo;s bluff, lined face at sight of the Aiel.</p>

<p>Tam&rsquo;s gaze only rested thoughtfully on them for a
moment, though, before coming to rest on Perrin with a start almost
as big as for Loial. He was a sturdy, deep-chested man despite hair
that was nearly all gray, the sort it would take an earthquake to
knock off his feet and more than that to fluster. &ldquo;Perrin, lad!&rdquo; he
exclaimed. &ldquo;Is Rand with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about Mat?&rdquo; Abell added eagerly. He had the
look of an older, graying Mat, but with more serious eyes. A man
not thickened much by age, with an agile step.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are well,&rdquo; Perrin told them. &ldquo;In Tear.&rdquo; He
caught Verin&rsquo;s glance from the corner of his eye; she knew very well
what Tear meant for Rand. Alanna hardly seemed to be paying
attention at all. &ldquo;They would have come with me, but we didn&rsquo;t know
how bad things are.&rdquo; That was true on both counts, he was sure.
&ldquo;Mat spends his time dicing&mdash;and winning&mdash;and kissing
the girls. Rand&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Well, the last I saw of Rand, he was wearing
a fancy coat and had a pretty golden-haired girl on his arm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That sounds like my Mat,&rdquo; Abell chuckled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s as well they didn&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; Tam said more
slowly, &ldquo;what with the Trollocs. And the Whitecloaks&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He
shrugged. &ldquo;You know the Trollocs returned?&rdquo; Perrin nodded. &ldquo;Was
that Aes Sedai right? Moiraine. Were they after you three lads,
that Winternight? Did you ever find out why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Brown sister gave Perrin a warning look. Alanna
appeared absorbed in rummaging through her saddlebags, but he
thought she was listening now. Neither was what made him hesitate,
though. There was just no way to come out and tell Tam that his son
could channel, that Rand was the Dragon Reborn. How could he tell a
man something like that? Instead, he said, &ldquo;You will have to ask
Moiraine. Aes Sedai don&rsquo;t tell you any more than they have to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have noticed,&rdquo; Tam said dryly.</p>

<p>Both Aes Sedai were definitely listening, and making
no secret of it now. Alanna arched an icy eyebrow at Tam, and Abell
shifted his feet as if he thought Tam was pushing his luck, but it
would take more than a stare to upset Tam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can we talk outside?&rdquo; Perrin asked the two men. &ldquo;I
want a breath of air.&rdquo; He wanted to talk without Aes Sedai
eavesdropping and watching, but he could hardly say so.</p>

<p>Tam and Abell were agreeable, and perhaps as eager to
escape Verin and Alanna&rsquo;s scrutiny as he, but first there was the
matter of the rabbits, all of which they handed over to Alanna.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We meant to keep two for ourselves,&rdquo; Abell said,
&ldquo;but it seems you have more mouths to feed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no need for this.&rdquo; The Green sister sounded
as though she had said as much often before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We like to pay for what we get.&rdquo; Tam told her,
sounding the same. &ldquo;The Aes Sedai were kind enough to do a little
Healing for us,&rdquo; he added to Perrin, &ldquo;and we want to stock up
credit in case we need it again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin nodded. He could understand not wanting to
take a gift from Aes Sedai. &ldquo;An Aes Sedai&rsquo;s gift always has a hook
in it,&rdquo; the old saying went. Well, he knew the truth of that. But
it did not really matter whether you took the gift or paid for it;
Aes Sedai managed to set the hook anyway. Verin was watching him
with a tiny smile, as if she knew what he was thinking.</p>

<p>As the three men started out, carrying their bows,
Faile rose to follow. Perrin shook his head at her, and amazingly
she sat back down. He wondered if she was ill.</p>

<p>After pausing so Tam and Abell could admire Stepper
and Swallow, they strolled off a way under the trees. The sun
slanted westward, lengthening shadows. The older men made a few
jokes about his beard, but they never mentioned his eyes.
Strangely, the omission did not bother him. He had more important
worries than whether somebody thought his eyes peculiar.</p>

<p>Responding to Abell&rsquo;s query as to whether &ldquo;that
thing&rdquo; was any good for straining soup, he rubbed his beard and
said mildly, &ldquo;Faile likes it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh-ho,&rdquo; Tam chuckled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the girl, is it? A
spirited look to her, lad. She&rsquo;ll have you lying awake nights
trying to tell up from down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only one way to handle that sort,&rdquo; Abell said,
nodding. &ldquo;Let her think she&rsquo;s running things. That way, when it&rsquo;s
important, and you say different, by the time she gets over the
shock of it, you&rsquo;ll have matters arranged as you want, and it will
be too late for her to badger you about changing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That seemed to Perrin a great deal like what Mistress
al&rsquo;Vere had told Faile about handling men. He wondered if Abell and
Marin had ever compared notes. Not likely. Perhaps it was worth
trying with Faile. Only, she seemed to have her own way in any
case.</p>

<p>He glanced over his shoulder. The sickhouse was
almost hidden by the trees. They had to be safe from the Aes
Sedai&rsquo;s ears. He listened carefully, drew a deep breath. A
woodpecker drummed somewhere in the distance. There were squirrels
in the leafy branches overhead, and a fox had passed this way not
long ago with its kill, a rabbit. Aside from the three of them,
there was no man scent, nothing to indicate a hidden Warder
listening. Perhaps he was being too cautious, but good reasons or
no, he could not get past the coincidence of both Aes Sedai being
women he had met before, one a woman Egwene did not trust, the
other a woman he was not sure he trusted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you stay here?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;With Verin and
Alanna?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo; Abell replied. &ldquo;How could a man sleep with
Aes Sedai under the same roof? What there is of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We thought this would be a good place to hide,&rdquo; Tam
said, &ldquo;but they were here before us. I think those Warders might
have killed both of us if Marin and some others of the Women&rsquo;s
Circle hadn&rsquo;t been here then, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abell grimaced. &ldquo;I think it was the Aes Sedai finding
out who we were that stopped it. Who our sons were, I mean. They
show too much interest in you boys to suit me.&rdquo; He hesitated,
fingering his bow. &ldquo;That Alanna let slip that you&rsquo;re <em>
ta&rsquo;veren</em>. All three of you. I&rsquo;ve heard Aes Sedai can&rsquo;t
lie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen any signs of it in me,&rdquo; Perrin said
wryly. &ldquo;Or Mat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tam glanced at him when he did not mention Rand&mdash;he was going to have to learn to lie better, trying to keep
his own secrets and everybody else&rsquo;s, too&mdash;but what the older
man said was, &ldquo;Maybe you just don&rsquo;t know what to look for. How is
it you come to be traveling with an Ogier and three Aiel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The last peddler I saw said there were Aiel this
side of the Spine of the World,&rdquo; Abell put in, &ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t
believe him. Said he&rsquo;d heard there were Aiel in Murandy, of all
places, or maybe Altara. He wasn&rsquo;t too certain of exactly where,
but a long way from the Waste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of that has anything to do with <em>
ta&rsquo;veren</em>,&rdquo; Perrin said. &ldquo;Loial is a friend, and he came to
help me. Gaul is a friend, too, I suppose. Bain and Chiad came with
Faile, not me. It&rsquo;s all sort of complicated, but it just happened.
Nothing to do with <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, whatever the reason,&rdquo;&rsquo; Abell said, &ldquo;the Aes
Sedai are interested in you lads. Tam and I traveled all the way to
Tar Valon last year, to the White Tower, trying to find out where
you were. We could hardly unearth one to admit she knew your names,
but it was plain they were hiding something. The Keeper of the
Chronicles had us on a boat heading downriver, our pockets stuffed
with gold and our heads full of vague assurances, almost before we
could make our bows. I don&rsquo;t like the idea the Tower may be using
Mat some way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin wished he could tell Mat&rsquo;s father nothing like
that was going on, but he was not sure he was up to that big a lie
with a straight face. Moiraine was not watching Mat because she
liked his grin; Mat was tangled as deeply with the Tower as he
himself, maybe deeper. The three of them were all tied tight, and
the Tower held the strings.</p>

<p>A silence descended on them, until at last Tam said
quietly, &ldquo;Lad, about your family. I&rsquo;ve sad news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Perrin said quickly, and the hush fell
again, with each staring at his own boots. Quiet was what was
needed. A few moments to pull back from painful emotions and the
embarrassment of having them plain on your face.</p>

<p>Wings fluttered, and Perrin looked up to see a large
raven alighting in an oak fifty paces away, beady black eyes sharp
on the three men. His hand darted for his quiver, but even as he
drew fletchings to cheek, two arrows knocked, the raven from its
perch. Tam and Abell were already nocking anew, eyes scanning the
trees and sky for more of the black birds. There was nothing.</p>

<p>Tam&rsquo;s shot had taken the raven in the head, which was
no surprise and no accident. Perrin had not lied when he told Faile
these two men were better than he with the bow. No one in the Two
Rivers could match Tam&rsquo;s shooting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Filthy things,&rdquo; Abell muttered, putting a foot on
the bird to pull his arrow free. Cleaning the arrow point in the
dirt, he returned it to his quiver. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re everywhere
nowadays.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Aes Sedai told us about them,&rdquo; Tam said, &ldquo;spying
for the Fades, and we spread the word. The Women&rsquo;s Circle did, too.
Nobody paid much mind until they started attacking sheep, though,
pecking out eyes, killing some. The clip will be bad enough this
year without that. Not that it matters much, I suppose. Between
Whitecloaks and Trollocs, I doubt we&rsquo;ll see any merchants after our
wool this year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some fool has gone crazy over it,&rdquo; Abell added.
&ldquo;Maybe more than one. We&rsquo;ve found all sorts of dead animals.
Rabbits, deer, foxes, even a bear. Killed and left to rot. Most not
even skinned. It&rsquo;s a man, or men, not Trollocs; I found boot
prints. A big man, but too small for a Trolloc. A shame and a
waste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slayer. Slayer here, and not just in the wolf dream.
Slayer and Trollocs. The man in the dream had seemed familiar.
Perrin scuffed dirt and leaves over the dead raven with his boot.
There would be plenty of time for Trollocs later. A lifetime, if
need be. &ldquo;I promised Mat I&rsquo;d look after Bode and Eldrin, Master
Cauthon. How hard will it he to get them, and the others,
free?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hard,&rdquo; Abell sighed, his face sagging. Suddenly he
looked his age and more. &ldquo;Powerful hard. I got close enough to see
Natti after they took her, walking outside the tent where they&rsquo;re
holding everybody. I could see her with a couple of hundred
Whitecloaks between us. I got a little careless, and one of them
put an arrow through me. If Tam hadn&rsquo;t hauled me back here to the
Aes Sedai&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good-sized camp,&rdquo; Tam said, &ldquo;right under
Watch Hill. Seven or eight hundred men. Patrols, day and night,
with the heaviest concentration from Watch Hill down to Emond&rsquo;s
Field. If they spread out more, it would make things easier for us,
but except for a hundred men or so at Taren Ferry, they&rsquo;ve just
about given the rest of the Two Rivers over to the Trollocs. It&rsquo;s
bad down around Deven Ride, I hear. Another farm burned almost
every night. The same between Watch Hill and the River Taren.
Bringing Natti and the others out will be hard, and after, we&rsquo;ll
have to hope the Aes Sedai will let them stay here. That pair
aren&rsquo;t too pleased at anyone knowing where they are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely someone will hide them,&rdquo; Perrin protested.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell me everyone&rsquo;s turned their backs on you. They don&rsquo;t
really believe you&rsquo;re Darkfriends?&rdquo; Even as he said it, he was
remembering Cenn Buie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not that,&rdquo; Tam said, &ldquo;except for a few fools.
Plenty of folk will give us a meal, or a night in the barn,
sometimes even a bed, but you have to understand they&rsquo;re uneasy
about helping people the Whitecloaks are chasing. It&rsquo;s nothing to
blame them for. Things are stone hard, and most men are trying to
look after their own families the best they can, Asking someone to
take in Natti and the girls, Haral and Alsbet&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Well, it might
be asking too much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought better of Two Rivers folk than that,&rdquo;
Perrin muttered.</p>

<p>Abell managed a weak smile. &ldquo;Most people feel caught
between two millstones, Perrin. They&rsquo;re just hoping they aren&rsquo;t
ground to flour between Whitecloaks and Trollocs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They should stop hoping and do something.&rdquo; For a
moment Perrin felt abashed. He had not been living here; he had no
idea what it was like. But he was still right. As long as the
people hid behind the Children of the Light, they would have to put
up with whatever the Children wanted to do, whether taking books or
arresting women and girls. &ldquo;Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll take a look at this
Whitecloak camp. There has to be some way to free them. And once
they are, we can turn our attention to Trollocs. A Warder once told
me Trollocs call the Aiel Waste &lsquo;the Dying Ground.&rsquo; I mean to make
them give that name to the Two Rivers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perrin,&rdquo; Tam began, then stopped, looking
troubled.</p>

<p>Perrin knew his eyes caught the light, there in the
shadows under the oak. His face felt carved from rock.</p>

<p>Tam sighed. &ldquo;First we&rsquo;ll see about Natti and the
others. Then we can decide what to do about the Trollocs. &rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let it eat you inside, boy,&rdquo; Abell said
softly. &ldquo;Hate can grow till it burns everything else out of
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing is eating me,&rdquo; Perrin told them in a level
voice. &ldquo;I just mean to do what needs doing.&rdquo; He ran a thumb along
the edge of his axe. What needed doing.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Dain Bornhald held himself straight in his saddle as
the hundred he had taken on patrol approached Watch Hill. Fewer
than a hundred, now. Eleven saddles had cloak-wrapped bodies tied
across them, and twenty-three more men nursed wounds. The Trollocs
had laid a neat ambush; it might have succeeded against soldiers
less well trained, less tough than the Children. What troubled him
was that this was his third patrol to be attacked in force. Not a
chance encounter, not happening on Trollocs killing and burning,
but meeting a planned attack. And only patrols he led personally.
The Trollocs tried to avoid the others. The fact presented
worrisome questions, and the answers he came up with gave no
solutions.</p>

<p>The sun was dropping. A few lights already appeared
in the village that covered the hill from top to bottom with
thatched roofs. The only tile roof stood at the crest, on the White
Boar, the inn. Another evening he might have gone up there for a
cup of wine, despite the nervous silence that closed in at the
sight of a white cloak with a golden sunburst. He seldom drank, but
he sometimes enjoyed being around people outside the Children;
after a time they would forget his presence to some extent, and
begin to laugh and talk among themselves again. On another evening.
Tonight he wanted to be alone to think.</p>

<p>There was activity among the hundred or so colorful
wagons gathered less than half a mile from the foot of the hill,
men and women in even brighter hues than their wagons, examining
horses and harness, loading things that had been lying about the
camp for weeks. It seemed the Traveling People meant to live up to
their name, probably at first light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Farran!&rdquo; The thick-bodied hundredman heeled his
horse closer, and Bornhald nodded toward the Tuatha&rsquo;an caravan.
&ldquo;Inform the Seeker that if he wishes to move his people, they will
move south.&rdquo; His maps said there was no crossing of the Taren
except at Taren Ferry, but he had begun learning how old they were
as soon as he crossed the river. No one was leaving the Two Rivers
to perhaps seal his command into a trap as long as he could stop
it. &ldquo;And Farran? There is no need to use boots or fists, yes? Words
will suffice. This Raen has ears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By your command, Lord Bornhald.&rdquo; The hundredman
sounded only a little disappointed. Touching gauntleted fist to
heart, he wheeled away toward the Tuatha&rsquo;an encampment. He would
not like it, but he would obey. Despise the Traveling People as he
might, he was a good soldier.</p>

<p>The sight of his own camp brought a moment of pride
to Bornhald, the long neat rows of wedge-roofed white tents, the
picket lines for the horses precisely arrayed. Even here in this
Light-forsaken corner of the world, the Children maintained
themselves, never allowing discipline to slack. It was
Light-forsaken. The Trollocs proved that. If they burned farms, it
only meant some folk here were pure. Some. The rest bowed, and said
&ldquo;Yes, my Lord,&rdquo; &ldquo;as you wish, my Lord,&rdquo; and stubbornly went their
own way as soon as his back was turned. Besides which, they were
hiding an Aes Sedai. The second day south of the Taren they had
killed a Warder; the man&rsquo;s color-shifting cloak had been sufficient
proof. Bornhald hated Aes Sedai, meddling with the One Power as if
Breaking the World once was not enough. They would do it again if
they were not stopped. His momentary good mood faded like spring
snow.</p>

<p>His eye sought out the tent where the prisoners were
kept, except for a brief exercise period each day, one at a time.
None would try running when it meant leaving the others behind. Not
that running would get them more that a dozen paces&mdash;a guard
stood at either end of the tent, and a dozen paces in any direction
took in another twenty Children&mdash;but he wanted as little
trouble as possible. Trouble sparked trouble. If rough treatment
was needed with the prisoners, it might raise resentment in the
village to a point where something had to be done about it. Byar
was a fool. He&mdash;and others, Farran especially&mdash;wanted
to put the prisoners to the question. Bornhald was not a
Questioner, and he did not like to use their methods. Nor did he
mean to let Farran anywhere near those girls, even if they were
Darkfriends, as Ordeith claimed.</p>

<p>Darkfriends or no Darkfriends, he realized more and
more that all he really wanted was one Darkfriend. More than the
Trollocs, more than Aes Sedai, he wanted Perrin Aybara. He could
hardly credit Byar&rsquo;s tales of the man running with wolves, but
Byar was clear enough that Aybara had led Bornhald&rsquo;s father into a
Darkfriend trap, led Geofram Bornhald to his death on Toman Head at
the hands of the Seanchan Darkfriends and their Aes Sedai allies.
Perhaps, if neither of the Luhhans talked soon, he might let Byar
have his way with the blacksmith. Either the man would crack, or
his wife would, watching. One of them would give him the means to
find Perrin Aybara.</p>

<p>When he dismounted in front of his tent, Byar was
there to meet him, stiff and gaunt as a scarecrow. Bornhald glanced
distastefully toward a much smaller collection of tents apart from
the rest. The wind was from that direction, and he could smell the
other camp. They did not keep their picket lines clean, or
themselves. &ldquo;Ordeith is back, it seems, yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my Lord Bornhald.&rdquo; Byar stopped, and Bornhald
looked at him questioningly. &ldquo;They report a skirmish with Trollocs
to the south. Two dead. Six wounded, they claim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who are the dead?&rdquo; Bornhald asked quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Child Joelin and Child Gomanes, my Lord Bornhald.&rdquo;
Byar&rsquo;s hollow-cheeked expression never changed.</p>

<p>Bornhald drew off his steel-backed gauntlets slowly.
The two he had sent off to accompany Ordeith, to see what he did on
his forays south. Carefully, he did not raise his voice. &ldquo;My
compliments to Master Ordeith, Byar, and&mdash;No! No compliments.
Tell him, in these words, that I will have his scrawny bones before
me now. Tell him, Byar, and bring him if you must arrest him and
those filthy wretches who disgrace the Children. Go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bornhald held his anger until he was inside his tent,
flap lowered, then swept maps and writing case from his camp table
with a snarl. Ordeith must think him an imbecile. Twice he had
sent men with the fellow, and twice they had been the only deaths
in &ldquo;a skirmish with Trollocs&rdquo; that left no wounded to show among
the rest. Always to the south. The man was obsessed with Emond&rsquo;s
Field. Well, he himself might have had his camp there, if not for&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;No point to it now. He had the Luhhans here. They would give
him Perrin Aybara, one way or another. Watch Hill was a much better
site if he had to move to Taren Ferry quickly. Military
considerations before personal.</p>

<p>For the thousandth time he wondered why the Lord
Captain Commander had sent him here. The people seemed no different
from those he had seen a hundred other places. Except that only the
Taren Ferry folk showed any enthusiasm for rooting out their own
Darkfriends. The rest stared with a sullen stubbornness when the
Dragon&rsquo;s Fang was scrawled on a door. A village always knew who its
own undesirables were; they were always ready to cleanse
themselves, with a little encouragement, and any Darkfriends were
certain to be swept up with the others the people wanted gone. But
not here. The black scrawl of a sharp fang on a door might as well
be new whitewash for all of its real effect. And the Trollocs. Had
Pedron Niall known the Trollocs would come when he wrote those
orders? How could he have? But if not, why had he sent enough of
the Children to put down a small rebellion? And why under the Light
had the Lord Captain Commander burdened him with a murderous
madman?</p>

<p>The tent flap swept aside, and Ordeith swaggered in.
His fine gray coat was embroidered with silver, but stained
heavily. His scrawny neck was dirty, too, jutting out of his collar
and giving him the look of a turtle. &ldquo;A good evening to you, my
Lord Bornhald. A gracious good evening, and splendid.&rdquo; The Lugard
accent was heavy today.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happened to Child Joelin and Child Gomanes,
Ordeith?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such a terrible thing, my Lord. When we came on the
Trollocs, Child Gomanes bravely&mdash;&rdquo; Bornhald struck him across
the face with his gauntlets. Staggering, the bony man put a hand to
his split lip, examined the red on his fingers. The smile on his
face no longer mocked. It looked viperish. &ldquo;Are you forgetting who
signed my commission now, lordling? Pedron Niall will be hanging
you with your mother&rsquo;s guts if I say a word, after he has the both
of you skinned alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is if you are alive to speak this word,
yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ordeith snarled, crouching like some wild thing,
spittle bubbling. Slowly he shook himself, slowly straightened. &ldquo;We
must work together.&rdquo; The Lugarder accent was gone, replaced by a
grander, more commanding tone. Bornhald preferred the taunting
Lugarder voice to the slightly oily, barely veiled contempt in this
one. &ldquo;The Shadow lies all around us here. Not simply Trollocs and
Myrddraal. They are the least of it. Three were spawned here,
Darkfriends meant to shake the world, their breeding guided by the
Dark One for a thousand years or more. Rand al&rsquo;Thor. Mat Cauthon.
Perrin Aybara. You know their names. In this place, forces are
loosed that will harrow the world. Creatures of the Shadow walk the
night, tainting men&rsquo;s hearts, corrupting men&rsquo;s dreams. Scourge this
land. Scourge it, and they will come. Rand al&rsquo;Thor. Mat Cauthon.
Perrin Aybara.&rdquo; He almost caressed the last name.</p>

<p>Bornhald drew ragged breath. He was not sure how
Ordeith had discovered what he wanted here; one day the man had
simply revealed his knowledge. &ldquo;I covered over what you did at the
Aybara farm&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scourge them.&rdquo; There was a hint of madness in that
grand voice, and sweat on Ordeith&rsquo;s brow. &ldquo;Flay them, and the three
will come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bornhald raised his voice. &ldquo;Covered it over because I
had to.&rdquo; There had been no choice. If the truth came out, he would
have more than sullen stares to contend with. The last thing he
needed was open rebellion on top of Trollocs. &ldquo;But I will not
condone the murder of Children. Do you hear me? What is it you do
that you need to hide from the Children?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you doubt the Shadow will do whatever is needed
to stop me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you doubt it?&rdquo; Ordeith leaned forward intently.
&ldquo;You saw the Gray Men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bornhald hesitated. Fifty of the Children around him,
in the middle of Watch Hill, and no one had noticed the pair with
their daggers. He had looked right at them and not seen. Until
Ordeith killed the pair. The scrawny little fellow had gained
considerable standing with the men for that. Later Bornhald had
buried the daggers deep. Those blades had looked to be steel, but a
touch seared like molten metal. The first earth thrown on them in
the pit had hissed and steamed. &ldquo;You believe they were after
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, my Lord Bornhald. After me. Whatever it
takes to stop me. The Shadow itself wants to stop me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That still says nothing of murdered&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must do what I do in secret.&rdquo; It was a whisper,
almost a hiss. &ldquo;The Shadow can enter men&rsquo;s minds to find me out,
enter men&rsquo;s thoughts and dreams. Would you like to die in a dream?
It can happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;mad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me a free hand, and I will give you Perrin
Aybara. That is what Pedron Niall&rsquo;s orders require. A free hand for
me, and I will place Perrin Aybara in yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bornhald was silent for a long time. &ldquo;I do not want
to look at you,&rdquo; he said finally. &ldquo;Get out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Ordeith was gone, Bornhald shivered. What was
the Lord Captain Commander up to with this man? But if it put
Aybara in his grasp&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Tossing his gauntlets down, he began
digging through his belongings. Somewhere he had a flask of
brandy.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The man who called himself Ordeith, even sometimes
thought of himself as Ordeith, slunk through the tents of the
Children of the Light, watching the white-cloaked men with a wary
eye. Useful tools, ignorant tools, but not to be trusted.
Especially not Bornhald; that one might have to be disposed of, if
he became too troublesome. Byar would be much more easily handled.
But not yet. There were other matters more important. Some of the
soldiers nodded respectfully as he passed. He showed them his teeth
in what they took for a friendly smile. Tools, and fools.</p>

<p>His eyes skittered hungrily across the tent holding
the prisoners. They could wait. For a while yet. A little while
longer. They were only tidbits anyway. Bait. He should have
restrained himself at the Aybara farm, but Con Aybara had laughed
in his face, and Joslyn had called him a filthy-minded little fool
for naming her son Darkfriend. Well, they had learned, screaming,
burning. In spite of himself he giggled under his breath.
Tidbits.</p>

<p>He could feel one of those he hated out there
somewhere, south, toward Emond&rsquo;s Field. Which one? It did not
matter. Rand al&rsquo;Thor was the only really important one. He would
have known if it was al&rsquo;Thor. Rumor had not drawn him yet, but it
would. Ordeith shivered with desire. It had to be so. More tales
must be gotten past Bornhald&rsquo;s guards at Taren Ferry, more reports
of the scouring of the Two Rivers, to drift to Rand al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s ears
and sear his brain. First al&rsquo;Thor, then the Tower, for what they
had taken from him. He would have all that was his by right.</p>

<p>Everything had been ticking along like a fine clock,
even with Bornhald impeding, until this new one appeared with his
Gray Men. Ordeith scrubbed bony fingers through greasy hair. Why
could not his dreams at least be his own? He was a puppet no
longer, danced about by Myrddraal and Forsaken, by the Dark One
himself. He pulled the strings now. They could not stop him, could
not kill him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing can kill me,&rdquo; he muttered, scowling. &ldquo;Not
me. I have survived since the Trolloc Wars.&rdquo; Well, a part of him
had. He laughed shrilly, hearing madness in the cackle; knowing it,
not caring.</p>

<p>A young Whitecloak officer frowned at him. This time
there was nothing of a smile in Ordeith&rsquo;s bared teeth, and the
fuzzy-cheeked lad recoiled. Ordeith hurried on in a slinking
shuffle.</p>

<p>Flies buzzed about his own tents, and sullen,
suspicious eyes flinched away from his. The white cloaks were
soiled here. But the swords were sharp, and obedience instant and
unquestioning. Bornhald thought these men were still his. Pedron
Niall believed it, too, believed Ordeith his tame creature.
Fools.</p>

<p>Twitching aside his tent flap, Ordeith went in to
examine his prisoner, stretched out between two pegs thick enough
to hold a wagon team. Good steel chain quivered as he checked it,
but he had calculated how much was needed, then doubled it. As well
he had. One loop less, and those stout steel links would have
broken.</p>

<p>With a sigh, he seated himself on the edge of his
bed. The lamps were already lit, more than a dozen, leaving no
shadow anywhere. The tent was as bright inside as noonday. &ldquo;Have
you thought over my proposal? Accept, and you walk free. Refuse&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I know how to hurt your sort. I can make you scream through
endless dying. Forever dying, forever screaming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chains hummed at a jerk; the stakes driven deep
into the ground creaked. &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; The Myrddraal&rsquo;s voice was
dried snakeskin crumbling. &ldquo;I accept. Release me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ordeith smiled. It thought him a fool. It would
learn. They all would. &ldquo;First, the matter of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;shall we say,
agreements and accord?&rdquo; As he talked, the Myrddraal began to
sweat.</p>
