<h4><em>Within the Ways</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
darkness of the Ways compressed the light of
Perrin&rsquo;s pole-lantern to a sharp-edged pool around himself and
Gaul. The creak of his saddle, the gritty click of hooves on stone,
seemed to reach no further than light&rsquo;s rim. There was no smell to
the air; nothing. The Aielman strode along beside Stepper easily,
keeping an eye on the dimly seen lanternglow from Loial&rsquo;s party
ahead. Perrin refused to call it Faile&rsquo;s. The Ways did not seem to
bother Gaul, for all their reputation. Perrin himself could not
help listening, as he had for nearly two days, or what passed for
days in this lightless place. His ears would be first to catch the
sound that meant they were all going to die or worse, the sound of
wind rising where no wind ever blew. No wind but <em>Machin
Shin</em>, the Black Wind that ate souls. He could not help
thinking that traveling the Ways was slack-witted folly, but when
need called, what was foolish changed.</p>

<p>The faint light ahead stopped, and he drew rein in
the middle of what appeared to be an ancient stone bridge arching
through utter blackness, ancient because of the breaks in the
bridge walls, the pits and shallow ragged craters freckling the
roadbed. Very likely it had stood close to three thousand years,
but it seemed ready to fall, now. Maybe right now.</p>

<p>The packhorse crowded up behind Stepper: the animals
whickered to each other and rolled their eyes uneasily at the
surrounding dark. Perrin knew how the horses felt. A few more
people for company would have lifted some of the endless night&rsquo;s
weight. Still, he would not have gone any closer to the lanterns
ahead even had he been alone. Not and risk a repeat of what
happened back on that first Island, right after entering the
Waygate in Tear. He scratched his curly beard irritably. He was not
sure what he had expected, but not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>The pole lantern bobbed as he stepped down from
his saddle and led Stepper and the packhorse to the Guiding, a tall
slab of white stone covered with cursive silver inlays vaguely
reminiscent of vines and leaves, all pitted as if splashed with
acid. He could not read it, of course&mdash;Loial had to do that;
it was Ogier script&mdash;and after a moment he walked around it,
studying the Island. It was the same as the others he had seen,
with a chest high wall of white stone, simple curves and rounds
fitted in an intricate pattern. At intervals bridges pierced the
wall, arching out into the darkness, and railless ramps running up
or down with no means of support he could see. There were cracks
everywhere, ragged pits and shallow craters, as though the stone
were rotting. When the horses moved there was a grainy sound of
stone flaking away beneath their hooves. Gaul peered into the dark
with no visible nervousness, but then, he did not know what might
be out there. Perrin did, too well</em>.</p>

<p><em>When Loial and the others arrived, Faile
immediately hopped from her black mare and strode straight to
Perrin, eyes intent on his face. He was already regretting making
her worry, but she did not look worried at all. He could not have
said what her expression was, besides fixed</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Have you decided to talk to me instead of over
my hea&mdash;?</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Her full armed slap made spots dance in front of
his eyes. &ldquo;What did you mean,&rdquo; she practically spat, &ldquo;charging in
here like a wild boar? You have no regard. None!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>He took a slow, deep breath. &ldquo;I asked you before
not to do that.&rdquo; Her dark, tilted eyes widened as if he had said
something infuriating. He was rubbing his cheek when her second
slap caught him on the other side, nearly unhinging his jaw. The
Aiel were watching interestedly, and Loial with his ears
drooping.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I told you not to do that,&rdquo; he growled. Her fist
was not very big, but her sudden punch to his shortribs drove most
of the air from his lungs, hunching him over sideways, and she drew
back her fist again. With a snarl, he seized her by the scruff of
her neck and</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, it was her own fault. It was. He had asked her
not to hit him, told her. Her own fault. He was surprised she had
not tried to pull one of her knives, though; she seemed to carry as
many as Mat.</p>

<p>She had been furious, of course. Furious with Loial
for trying to intervene; she could take care of herself, thank you
very much. Furious with Bain and Chiad for <em>not</em> intervening; she had
been taken aback when they said they did not think she would want
them to interfere in a fight she had picked. <em>When you choose
the fight</em>, Bain had said, <em>you must take the consequences,
win or lose</em>. But she did not seem even the tiniest bit angry
with him any longer. That made him nervous. She had only stared at
him, her dark eyes glistening with unshed tears, which made him
feel guilty, which in turn made him angry. Why should he be guilty?
Was he supposed to stand there and let her hit him to her heart&rsquo;s
content? She had mounted Swallow and sat there, very stiff-backed,
refusing to sit gingerly, staring at him with an unreadable
expression. It made him very nervous. He almost wished she had
pulled a knife. Almost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are moving again,&rdquo; Gaul said.</p>

<p>Perrin jerked back to the present. The other light
<em>was</em> moving. Now it paused. One of them had noticed his
light was not following yet. Probably Loial. Faile might not mind
if he got lost, and the two Aiel women had twice tried to talk him
into walking off a little way with them. He had not needed the
slight shake of Gaul&rsquo;s head to refuse. He heeled Stepper forward,
leading the packhorse.</p>

<p>The Guiding here was more pocked than most he had
seen, but he rode on past it with only a glance. The light of the
other lanterns was already starting down one of the gently sloping
ramps, and he followed with a sigh. He hated the ramps. Sided only
by darkness, it began to curve, down and around, with nothing
discernible beyond the squashed light of the lantern swaying above
his head. Something told him that a fall over the edge would never
end. Stepper and the packhorse kept to the middle without any
urging, and even Gaul avoided the brink. Worse, when the ramp ended
on another Island, there was no way to escape the conclusion that
it lay directly beneath the one they had just left. He was glad to
see Gaul glancing upward, glad he was not alone in wondering what
held the Islands up and whether it was still sound.</p>

<p>Once more Loial and Faile&rsquo;s lanterns had stopped by
the Guiding, so he reined up again, just off the ramp. This time
they did not move on, though. After a few moments, Faile&rsquo;s voice
called, &ldquo;Perrin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He exchanged looks with Gaul, and the Aiel shrugged.
She had not spoken to Perrin since he&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perrin, come here.&rdquo; Not peremptory, exactly, but not
asking, either.</p>

<p>Bain and Chiad were squatting easily beside the
Guiding, and Loial and Faile sat their horses close by,
 pole-lanterns in hand. The Ogier had their packhorses&rsquo; lead line; his
ear tufts twitched as he looked from Faile to Perrin and back
again. She, on the other hand, seemed completely absorbed in
adjusting her riding gloves, of soft green leather with golden
falcons embroidered on their backs. She had changed her dress, too.
The new one was cut in the same fashion, with a high neck and
narrow divided skirts, but it was a dark green brocaded silk, and
somehow it seemed to emphasize her bosom. Perrin had never seen the
dress before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; he asked warily.</p>

<p>She looked up as if surprised to see him, tilted her
head thoughtfully, then smiled as though it had just occurred to
her. &ldquo;Oh, yes. I wanted to see if you could be taught to come when
I call.&rdquo; Her smiled deepened; it had to be because she had heard
his teeth grinding. He scrubbed at his nose; there was a faint rank
smell here.</p>

<p>Gaul chuckled softly. &ldquo;As well try to understand the
sun, Perrin. It simply is, and it is not to be understood. You
cannot live without it, but it exacts a price. So with women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bain leaned over to whisper in Chiad&rsquo;s ear, and they
both laughed. From the way they looked at Gaul and him, Perrin did
not think he would like hearing what the women found so funny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not that at all,&rdquo; Loial rumbled, ears shifting
testily. He gave Faile an accusing look, which did not abash her at
all; she smiled at him vaguely and went back to her gloves,
snugging each finger all over again. &ldquo;I am sorry, Perrin. She
insisted on being the one to call you. This is why. We are there.&rdquo;
He pointed to the base of the Guiding, where a wide pit-broken
white line ran off, not to bridge or ramp, but into the darkness.
&ldquo;The Waygate at Manetheren, Perrin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin nodded, saying nothing. He was not about to
suggest they follow the line, not and have Faile call him down for
trying to take over. He rubbed his nose again absently; that almost
imperceptible scent of rankness was irritating. He was not going to
make even the most sensible suggestion. If she wanted to lead, let
her. But she sat her saddle, fooling with her gloves, obviously
waiting for him to speak so she could make some witty remark. She
liked wittiness; he preferred saying what he meant. Irritably, he
turned Stepper, meaning to go on without her or Loial. The line led
to the Waygate, and he could pick out the <em>Avendesora</em> leaf
that opened it himself.</p>

<p>Suddenly his ear caught a muffled click of hooves from
the darkness, and the fetid smell slammed home in his mind.
&ldquo;Trollocs!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>

<p>Gaul pivoted smoothly to slide a spear into the
black-mailed chest of a wolf-snouted Trolloc dashing into the light with
scythe-like sword upraised; in the same effortless motion the Aiel
pulled his spearpoint free and sidestepped to let the huge shape
fall. More came behind it, though, all goat snouts and boar&rsquo;s
tusks, cruel beaks and twisted horns, with curved swords and spiked
axes and hooked spears. The horses danced and screamed.</p>

<p>Holding his pole-lantern high&mdash;the thought of
facing these things in the dark gave him cold sweat&mdash;Perrin
clawed for a weapon, swung at a face distorted by a sharp toothed
snout. He was surprised to realize he had pulled the hammer free of
its lashings on his saddlebags, but if it did not have the axe&rsquo;s
sharp edge, ten pounds of steel wielded by a blacksmith&rsquo;s arm still
sent the Trolloc staggering back shrieking and clutching a ruined
face.</p>

<p>Loial dashed his pole-lantern against a goat-horned
head, and the lantern broke; bathed in burning oil, the Trolloc ran
howling into the dark. The Ogier flailed about him with the stout
pole, a switch in his huge hands, but one that landed with sharp
cracks of splintering bone. One of Faile&rsquo;s knives blossomed in an
all-too-human eye above a tusked snout. The Aiel danced the spears,
having somehow found time to veil themselves. Perrin struck, and
struck, and struck. A whirlwind of death that lasted&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;A
minute? Five? It seemed an hour. But suddenly the Trollocs were
down, those not already dead kicking in their death throes.</p>

<p>Perrin sucked air into his lungs; his right arm felt
as if the weight of the hammer might pull it off. There was a
burning sensation on his face, a wetness trickling down his side,
another on his leg, where Trolloc steel had gotten through. Each of
the Aiel had at least one damp patch darkening their brown and gray
clothes, and Loial wore a bloody gash down his thigh. Perrin&rsquo;s eyes
went right past them, seeking Faile. If she was hurt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She sat
atop her black mare, a knife in her hand ready to throw. She had
actually managed to pull off her gloves and tuck them neatly behind
her belt. He could not see a wound on her. In all the blood smell&mdash;human, Ogier, Trolloc&mdash;he could not have picked out hers if she were
bleeding, but he knew her scent, and she did not have the pained
smell of injury. Bright lights hurt Trolloc eyes; they did not
adapt quickly. Very likely the only reason they were still alive
and the Trollocs dead was that abrupt entry from darkness into
light.</p>

<p>That was all the time they had, a moment&rsquo;s respite,
long enough to glance around, take breath. With a roar like a
hundred pounds of bone falling into a huge meat grinder, a Fade
leaped into the light, eyeless stare a stare of death, black sword
flickering like lightning. The horses screamed, trying to bolt.</p>

<p>Gaul barely managed to turn that blade with his
buckler, losing a slice from the side of it as if the layers of
cured bullhide were only paper. He stabbed, eluded a thrust&mdash;barely&mdash;and stabbed again. Arrows sprouted in the Myrddraal&rsquo;s
chest. Bain and Chiad had thrust their spears through the harness
holding the cased bows on their backs and were using those curved
horn bows. More arrows, pincushioning the Halfman&rsquo;s chest. Gaul&rsquo;s
spear, darting, stabbing. One of Faile&rsquo;s knives suddenly stood out
in that smooth maggot white face. The Fade would not fall, would
not stop trying to kill. Only the wildest dodging kept its sword
from finding flesh.</p>

<p>Perrin bared his teeth in an unconscious snarl. He
hated Trollocs as an enemy of his blood, but the Neverborn&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?
It was worth dying to kill a Neverborn. <em>To put my teeth in its
throat</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>!</em> Careless of whether he blocked Bain
and Chiad&rsquo;s arrows, he guided Stepper closer to the Neverborn&rsquo;s
back, forcing the reluctant dun nearer with reins and knees. At the
last instant, the creature spun away from Gaul, seemingly ignoring
a spearpoint that thrust between its shoulders and came out below
its throat, staring up at Perrin with the eyeless gaze that sent
fear into every man&rsquo;s soul. Too late. Perrin&rsquo;s hammer fell,
shattering head and eyeless gaze alike.</p>

<p>Even down and virtually headless, the Myrddraal still
thrashed, lashing aimlessly with its Thakan&rsquo;dar-wrought blade.
Stepper danced back, whickering nervously, and suddenly Perrin felt
as if he had been doused in icy water. That black steel made wounds
even Aes Sedai found hard to Heal, and he had ridden in uncaring.
<em>My teeth in its</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Light, I have to keep hold of
myself. I have to!</em></p>

<p>He could still hear smothered sounds from the
darkness at the far end of the Island, the clatter of hoofed feet,
the scrape of boots, harsh breathing and guttural murmurs. More
Trollocs; how many he could not say. A pity they had not been
linked to the Myrddraal, yet perhaps they might hesitate to attack
without it to drive them. Trollocs were usually cowards in their
way, preferring strong odds and easy kills. But even lacking a
Myrddraal they could work themselves up to come again
eventually.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Waygate,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We have to get out before
they decide what to do without that.&rdquo; He used the bloody hammer to
gesture to the still flailing Fade. Faile reined Swallow around
immediately, and he was so surprised, he blurted, &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t going
to argue?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not when you speak sense,&rdquo; she said briskly. &ldquo;Not
when you speak sense. Loial?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Ogier took the lead on his tall, hairy fetlocked
mount. Perrin backed Stepper after Faile and Loial, hammer in hand,
the Aiel siding him, all with bows ready now. Shuffling hooves and
boots followed in the blackness, and harsh mutters in a language
too rough for human tongues. Back and back, with the mutters edging
closer, working up courage.</p>

<p>Another sound floated to Perrin, like silk sighing
across silk. It sent shivers along his bones. Louder, a distant
giant&rsquo;s exhalation, rising, falling, rising higher. &ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; he
shouted. &ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Loial barked. &ldquo;I&mdash;That sound! Is it&mdash;? The Light illumine our souls, and the Creator&rsquo;s hand
shelter us! It&rsquo;s opening. It is opening! I must be last. Out! Out!
But not too&mdash;No, Faile!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin risked a glance over his shoulder. Twin gates
of apparently living leaves were swinging open, revealing a smoked
glass view of mountainous country. Loial had dismounted to remove
the <em>Avendesora</em> leaf to unlock the gate, and Faile had
their pack animals&rsquo; leads and his huge mount&rsquo;s reins. With a hasty
shout of &ldquo;Follow me! Quickly!&rdquo; she booted Swallow&rsquo;s ribs, and the
Tairen mare sprang toward the opening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After her,&rdquo; Perrin told the Aiel. &ldquo;Hurry! You cannot
fight this.&rdquo; Wisely they hesitated only a heartbeat before peeling
back, Gaul seizing the packhorse&rsquo;s lead line. Stepper came abreast
of Loial. &ldquo;Can you lock it shut some way? Block it?&rdquo; A frantic edge
had entered the harsh mutterings; the Trollocs had recognized the
sound too, now. <em>Machin Shin</em> was coming. Living meant
getting out of the Ways.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Loial said. &ldquo;Yes. But go. Go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin reined Stepper back quickly toward the Gate,
yet before he knew what he was doing he had thrown back his head
and howled, defiance and challenge. <em>Foolish, foolish,
foolish!</em> Still, he kept his eyes on that pitch dark and backed
Stepper into the Waygate. An icy ripple slid across him hair by
hair, and time stretched out. The jolt of leaving the Ways hit him,
as if he had gone from a dead gallop to a stop in one step.</p>

<p>The Aiel were still turning to face the Waygate,
spreading out across the slope with arrows nocked, among low bushes
and stunted mountain trees, wind-twisted pine and fir and
leatherleaf. Faile was just picking herself up from where she had
tumbled from Swallow&rsquo;s saddle, the black mare nuzzling her.
Galloping out of a Waygate was at least as bad as galloping in; she
was lucky she had not broken her neck, and her horse&rsquo;s, too.
Loial&rsquo;s tall horse and her packhorses were trembling as though hit
between the eyes. Perrin opened his mouth, and she glared at him,
daring him to make any comment at all, maybe a sympathetic one
least of all. He grimaced wryly and wisely kept silent.</p>

<p>Abruptly Loial came hurtling out of the Waygate,
leaping out of a dull silvery mirror with his own reflection
growing behind him, and rolled across the ground. Almost on his
heels, two Trollocs appeared, ram&rsquo;s horns and snout, eagle&rsquo;s beak
and feathered crest, but before they were more than halfway out,
the shimmering surface turned dead black, bubbling and bulging,
clinging to them.</p>

<p>Voices whispered in Perrin&rsquo;s head, a thousand
babbling mad voices clawing at the inside of his skull. <em>Bitter
blood. Blood so bitter. Drink the blood and crack the bone. Crack
the bone and suck the marrow. Bitter marrow, sweet the screams.
Singing screams. Sing the screams. Tiny souls. Acrid souls. Gobble
them down. So sweet the pain</em>. On and on.</p>

<p>Shrieking, howling, the Trollocs beat at the
blackness boiling around them, clawed to pull free as it sucked
them deeper, deeper, till only one hairy hand remained, clutching
frantically, then only darkness, bulging outward, seeking. Slowly
the Waygates appeared, sliding together, squeezing the blackness so
it oozed back inside between them. The voices in Perrin&rsquo;s head
finally stopped. Loial rushed forward quickly to place not one but
two three-lobed leaves among the myriad leaves and vines. The
Waygate became stone again, a section of stone wall, carved in
intricate detail, standing alone on a sparsely wooded mountainside.
Among the myriad leaves and vines was not one, but two <em>
Avendesora</em> leaves. Loial had replaced the trefoil leaf from
inside on the outside.</p>

<p>The Ogier heaved a deep, relieved sigh. &ldquo;That is the
best I can do. It can only be opened from this side now.&rdquo; He gave
Perrin a look at once anxious and firm. &ldquo;I could have locked it
forever by not replacing the leaves, but I will not ruin a Waygate,
Perrin. We grew the Ways and tended them. Perhaps they can be
cleansed someday. I cannot ruin a Waygate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will do,&rdquo; Perrin told him. Had the Trollocs been
coming to this Waygate, or had it just been a chance encounter? In
either case, it would do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was that&mdash;?&rdquo; Faile began unsteadily, then
stopped to swallow. Even the Aiel looked shaken for once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Machin Shin</em>,&rdquo; Loial said. &ldquo;The Black Wind.
A creature of the Shadow, or a thing grown of the Ways&rsquo; own taint&mdash;no one knows. I pity the Trollocs. Even them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin was not sure he did, not even dying like that.
He had seen what Trollocs left when they got their hands on humans.
Trollocs ate anything, so long as it was meat, and sometimes they
liked to keep their meat alive while they butchered. He would not
let himself pity Trollocs.</p>

<p>Stepper&rsquo;s hooves crunched on gritty dirt as Perrin
turned him to see where they were.</p>

<p>Cloud-capped mountains rose all around; it was the
everpresent clouds that gave them their name, the Mountains of
Mist. The air was cool at this altitude, even in summer, especially
compared to Tear. The late-afternoon sun sat on the western peaks,
glinting on streams running down to the river that coursed along
the floor of the long valley below. The Manetherendrelle, it was
called once it had traveled out of the mountains and much farther
west and south, but Perrin had grown up calling the length of it
that ran along the south edge of the Two Rivers the White River, an
uncrossable stretch of rapids that churned its waters to froth. The
Manetherendrelle. Waters of the Mountain Home.</p>

<p>Where bare rock showed in the valley below or on the
surrounding slopes, it glittered like glass. Once a city had stood
there, covering valley and mountains. Manetheren, city of soaring
spires and splashing fountains, capital of a great nation of the
same name, perhaps the most beautiful city in the world, according
to old Ogier tales. Gone now without a trace, except for the
all-but-indestructible Waygate that had stood in the Ogier grove.
Burned to barren rock more than two thousand years ago, while the
Trolloc Wars still raged, destroyed by the One Power after the
death of its last king, Aemon al&rsquo;Caar al&rsquo;Thorin, in his last bloody
battle against the Shadow. Aemon&rsquo;s Field, men had named that place,
where the village called Emond&rsquo;s Field now stood.</p>

<p>Perrin shivered. That was long ago. Trollocs had come
once since, on Winternight more than a year gone, the night before
he and Rand and Mat were forced to flee in the darkness with
Moiraine. That seemed long ago, too, now. It could not happen
again, with the Waygate locked. <em>It&rsquo;s Whitecloaks I have to
worry about, not Trollocs</em>.</p>

<p>A pair of white-winged hawks wheeled above the far
end of the valley. Perrin&rsquo;s eyes barely caught the streak of
a rising arrow. One of the hawks cartwheeled and fell, and Perrin
frowned. Why would anyone shoot a hawk up here in the mountains?
Over a farm, if it was after the chickens or the geese, but up
here? Why would anyone even be up here? Two Rivers people avoided
the mountains.</p>

<p>The second hawk swooped on snowy wings toward where
its mate had fallen, but suddenly it was climbing desperately. A
black cloud of ravens burst from the trees, surrounding it in wild
melee, and when they settled again, the hawk was gone.</p>

<p>Perrin made himself breathe. He had seen ravens, and
other birds, attack a hawk that came too close to their nests
before, but he could not make himself believe it that simple this
time. The birds had burst up from about where the arrow had risen.
Ravens. The Shadow used animals as spies, sometimes. Rats and
others that fed on death, usually. Ravens, especially. He had sharp
memories of running from sweeping lines of ravens that had hunted
him as though they had intelligence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you staring at?&rdquo; Faile asked, shading her
eyes to peer down the valley. &ldquo;Were those birds?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just birds,&rdquo; he said. <em>Maybe they were. I can&rsquo;t
frighten everybody until I&rsquo;m sure. Not while they&rsquo;re still shaky
from</em> Machin Shin.</p>

<p>He was still holding his bloody hammer, he realized,
slick with black Myrddraal blood. His fingers found drying blood on
his cheek, matting in his short beard. When he climbed down, his
side and his leg burned. He found a shirt in his saddlebags to
clean the hammer before the Fade&rsquo;s blood etched the metal. In a
moment he would find out if there was anything to fear in these
mountains. If it was more than men, the wolves would know.</p>

<p>Faile began unbuttoning his coat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tending your wounds,&rdquo; she snapped back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not
have you bleeding to death on me. That would be just like you, to
die and leave me the work of burying you. You have no
consideration. Hold still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said quietly, and she looked
surprised.</p>

<p>She made him strip off everything but his
smallclothes, so she could wash his wounds, rub them with ointment
fetched from her saddlebags. He could not see the cut on his face,
of course, but it seemed small and shallow, if uncomfortably close
to his eye. The slash across his left side was over a hand long,
though, straight along a rib, and the hole a spear had made in his
right thigh was deep. Faile had to put stitches in that, with
needle and thread from her sewing kit. He took it stoically; she
was the one who winced at every stitch. She muttered angrily under
her breath the whole time she worked, especially while rubbing her
dark stinging cream into his cheek, looking almost as if the hurts
were hers, and his fault, yet she tied bandages around his ribs and
his thigh with a gentle hand. It made a startling contrast, her
soft touch and her furious grumbles. Purely confusing.</p>

<p>While he donned a clean shirt and a spare pair of
breeches from his saddlebags, Faile stood fingering the slice in
the side of his coat. Two inches to the right, and he would not
have left that Island. Stamping his feet in his boots, he reached
for his coat&mdash;and she flung it at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t think I will sew that up for you. I&rsquo;ve
done all the sewing for you I mean to! Do you hear me, Perrin
Aybara?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask &rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t think it! That&rsquo;s all!&rdquo; She stalked away
to help the Aiel tend each other and Loial. That was an odd group,
the Ogier with his baggy breeches off, Gaul and Chiad eyeing each
other like strange cats, Faile spreading her ointment and wrapping
bandages and all the while shooting accusing glares at him. What
was he supposed to have done now?</p>

<p>Perrin shook his head. Gaul was right, he decided; as
well try to understand the sun.</p>

<p>Even knowing what he had to do now, he was reluctant,
especially after what had happened in the Ways, with the Fade. Once
he had seen a man who had forgotten he was human. The same could
happen to him. <em>Fool. You only have to hold out a few more days.
Just till you find the Whitecloaks</em>. And he had to know. Those
ravens.</p>

<p>He sent his mind questing across the valley for the
wolves. There were always wolves where men were not, and if they
were close, he could talk with them. Wolves avoided men, ignored
them as much as possible, but they hated Trollocs for unnatural
things, and despised Myrddraal with a hatred too deep to hold. If
Shadowspawn were in the Mountains of Mist, the wolves could tell
