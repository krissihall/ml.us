<h4><em>What Lies Hidden</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">C</span>lad
in her shift, Egwene drew a deep breath and left
the stone ring lying beside an open book on her bedside table. All
flecked and striped in brown and red and blue, it was slightly too
large for a finger ring, and shaped wrong, flattened and twisted so
that a fingertip run along the edge would circle both inside and
out before coming back to where it had started. There <em>was</em>
only one edge, impossible though that seemed. She was not leaving
the ring there because she might fail without it, because she
wanted to fail. She had to try without the ring sooner or later, or
she could never do more than dabble her toes where she dreamed of
swimming. It might as well be now. That was the reason. It was.</p>

<p>The thick leather bound book was <em>A Journey to
Tarabon</em>, written by Eurian Romavni, from Kandor&mdash;fifty
three years ago, according to the date the author gave in the first
line, but little of any consequence would have changed in Tanchico
in that short a time. Besides, it was the only volume she had found
with useful drawings. Most of the books only had portraits of
kings, or fanciful renderings of battles by men who had not seen
them.</p>

<p>Darkness filled both windows, but the lamps gave more
than adequate light. One tall beeswax candle burned in a gilded
candlestick on the bedside table. She had gone to fetch that
herself; this was no night to be sending a maid for a candle. Most
of the servants were tending the wounded or weeping over loved
ones, or being tended themselves. There had been too many for
Healing any but those who would have died without it.</p>

<p>Elayne and Nynaeve waited with high backed chairs
pulled to either side of the wide bed with its tall, swallow carved
posts; they tried to hide their anxiety with differing degrees of
success. Elayne managed a passably stately calm, and only spoiled
it by frowning and chewing her underlip when she thought Egwene was
not looking. Nynaeve was all brisk confidence, the sort that made
you feel comforted when she tucked you into a sickbed, but Egwene
recognized the set of her eyes; they said Nynaeve was afraid.</p>

<p>Aviendha sat cross-legged beside the door, her browns
and grays standing out sharply against the deep blue of the carpet.
This time the Aiel woman had her long bladed knife at one side of
her belt, a bristling quiver at the other, and four short spears
across her knees. Her round, hide buckler lay close at hand, atop a
horn bow in a worked leather case with straps that could hold it on
her back. After tonight, Egwene could not fault her for going
armed. She still wanted to hold a lightning bolt ready to fling
herself.</p>

<p><em>Light, what</em> was <em>that Rand did? Burn him,
he frightened me almost as badly as the Fades did. Maybe worse. It
isn&rsquo;t fair he can do something like that and I can&rsquo;t even see the
flows</em>.</p>

<p>She climbed onto the bed and took the leather-bound
book on her knees, frowning at an engraved map of Tanchico. Little
of any use was marked, really. A dozen fortresses, surrounding the
harbor, guarding the city on its three hilly peninsulas, the Verana
to the east, the Maseta in the center, and the Calpene nearest the
sea. Useless. Several large squares, some open areas that seemed to
be parks, and a number of monuments to rulers long since dust. All
useless. A few palaces, and things that seemed strange. The Great
Circle, for instance, on the Calpene. On the map it was just a
ring, but Master Romavni described it as a huge gathering place
that could hold thousands to watch horse races or displays of
fireworks by the Illuminators. There was also a King&rsquo;s Circle, on
the Maseta and larger than the Great Circle, and a Panarch&rsquo;s
Circle, on the Verana, just a little smaller. The Chapter House of
the Guild of Illuminators was marked as well. They were all
useless. The text certainly had nothing of use.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you certain you want to try this without the
ring?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certain,&rdquo; Egwene replied as calmly as she could. Her
stomach was leaping as badly as it had when she saw that first
Trolloc tonight, holding that poor woman by the hair and slitting
her throat like a rabbit&rsquo;s. The woman had screamed like a rabbit,
too. Killing the Trolloc had done her no good; the woman was as
dead as the Trolloc. Only her shrill scream would not go away. &ldquo;If
it doesn&rsquo;t work, I can always try again with the ring.&rdquo; She leaned
over to mark the candle with a thumbnail. &ldquo;Wake me when it burns
down to there. Light, but I wish we had a clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne laughed at her, a lighthearted trill, and it
very nearly sounded unforced. &ldquo;A clock in a bedchamber? My mother
has a dozen clocks, but I never heard of a clock in a
bedchamber.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my father has one clock,&rdquo; Egwene grumbled,
&ldquo;the only one in the whole village, and I wish I had it here. Do
you think it will burn that far in an hour? I don&rsquo;t want to sleep
longer than that. You must wake me as soon as the flame reaches
that mark. As soon as!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; Elayne said soothingly. &ldquo;I promise
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The stone ring,&rdquo; Aviendha said suddenly. &ldquo;Since you
are not using it, Egwene, could not someone&mdash;one of us&mdash;use it to go with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Egwene muttered. <em>Light, I wish they could
all come with me</em>. &ldquo;Thank you for the thought, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can only you use it, Egwene?&rdquo; the Aiel woman
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any of us might,&rdquo; Nynaeve replied, &ldquo;even you,
Aviendha. A woman needn&rsquo;t be able to channel, only sleep with it
touching her skin. A man might be able to, for all we know. But we
do not know <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> as well as Egwene, or the rules
of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha nodded. &ldquo;I see. A woman can make mistakes
where she does not know the ways, and her mistakes can kill others
as well as herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. &ldquo;The World of Dreams is a
dangerous place. That much we do know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Egwene will be careful,&rdquo; Elayne added, speaking
to Aviendha but obviously meaning it for Egwene&rsquo;s ears. &ldquo;She
promised. She will look around&mdash;carefully!&mdash;and no
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene concentrated on the map. Careful. If she had
not guarded her twisted stone ring so jealously&mdash;she thought
of it as hers; the Hall of the Tower might not agree, but they did
not know she had it&mdash;if she had been willing to let Elayne or
Nynaeve use it more than once or twice, they might know enough to
come with her now. Yet it was not regret that made her avoid
looking at the other women. She did not want them to see the fear
in her eyes.</p>

<p><em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. The Unseen World. The World
of Dreams. Not the dreams of ordinary people, though sometimes they
touched <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> briefly, in dreams that seemed as
true as life. Because they were. In the Unseen World, what happened
was real, in a strange way. Nothing that happened there affected
what was&mdash;a door opened in the World of Dreams would still be
shut in the real world; a tree cut down there still stood here&mdash;yet a woman could be killed there, or stilled. &ldquo;Strange&rdquo;
barely began to describe it. In the Unseen World the whole world
lay open, and maybe other worlds, too; any place was attainable. Or
at least, its reflection in the World of Dreams was. The weave of
the Pattern could be read there&mdash;past, present and future&mdash;by one who knew how. By a Dreamer. There had not been a
Dreamer in the White Tower since Corianin Nedeal, nearly five
hundred years earlier.</p>

<p><em>Four hundred and seventy three years, to be
exact</em>, Egwene thought. <em>Or is it four-hundred seventy-four
now? When did Corianin die?</em> If Egwene had had a chance to
finish novice training in the Tower, to study there as an Accepted,
perhaps she would know. There was so much she might have known,
then.</p>

<p>A list lay in Egwene&rsquo;s pouch of the
<em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, most small enough to slip into a pocket, that
had been stolen by the Black Ajah when they fled the Tower. They
all three had a copy. Thirteen of those stolen <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>
had &ldquo;no known use&rdquo; written alongside, and &ldquo;last studied by Corianin
Nedeal.&rdquo; But if Corianin Sedai had truly not discovered their uses,
Egwene was sure of one of them. They gave entrance to
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>; not as easily as the stone ring, perhaps,
and perhaps not without channeling, but they did it.</p>

<p>Two they had recovered from Joiya and Amico: an iron
disc, three inches across, scribed on both sides with a tight
spiral, and a plaque no longer than her hand, apparently clear
amber yet hard enough to scratch steel, with a sleeping woman
somehow carved into the middle of it. Amico had spoken freely of
them, and so had Joiya, after a session alone in her cell with
Moiraine that had left the Darkfriend pale-faced and almost civil.
Channel a flow of Spirit into either <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, and it
would take you into sleep and then into <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>.
Elayne had tried both of them briefly, and they worked, though all
she saw was the inside of the Stone, and Morgase&rsquo;s Royal Palace in
Caemlyn.</p>

<p>Egwene had not wanted her to try, however fleeting
the visit, but not from jealousy. She had not been able to argue
very effectively, though, for she had been afraid Elayne and
Nynaeve would hear what was in her voice.</p>

<p>Two recovered meant eleven still with the Black Ajah.
That was the point Egwene had tried to make. Eleven
<em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> that could take a woman to
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, all in the hands of Black sisters. When
Elayne made her short journeys into the Unseen World, she could
have found the Black Ajah waiting for her, or walked into them
before she knew they were there. The thought made Egwene&rsquo;s stomach
writhe. They could be waiting for her now. Not likely; not on
purpose&mdash;how would they know she was coming?&mdash;but they
could be there when she stepped through. One she could face, unless
she was caught by surprise, and she did not mean to allow that. But
if they did surprise her? Two or three of them together? Liandrin
and Rianna, Chesmal Emry and Jeane Caide and all the rest at
once?</p>

<p>Frowning at the map, she made her hands loosen their
white knuckled grip. Tonight had given everything urgency. If
Shadowspawn could attack the Stone, if one of the Forsaken could
suddenly appear in their midst, she could not give in to fear. They
had to know what to do. They had to have something besides Amico&rsquo;s
vague tale. Something. If only she could learn where Mazrim Taim
was in his caged journey to Tar Valon, or if she could somehow slip
into the Amyrlin&rsquo;s dreams and speak to her. Perhaps those things
were possible for a Dreamer. If they were, she did not know how.
Tanchico was what she had to work with.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must go alone, Aviendha. I must.&rdquo; She thought her
voice was calm and steady, but Elayne patted her shoulder.</p>

<p>Egwene did not know why she was scrutinizing the map.
She already had it fixed in her head, everything in relation to
everything else. Whatever existed in this world existed in the
World of Dreams, and sometimes more besides, of course. She had her
destination chosen. She thumbed through the book to the only
engraving showing the inside of a building named on the map, the
Panarch&rsquo;s Palace. It would do no good to find herself in a chamber
if she had no idea where it was in the city. None of it might do
any good in any case. She put that out of her mind. She had to
believe there was some chance.</p>

<p>The engraving showed a large room with a high
ceiling. A rope strung along waist high posts would keep anyone
from going too close to the things displayed on stands and in open
fronted cabinets along the walls. Most of those displays were
indistinct, but not what stood at the far end of the room. The
artist had taken pains to show the massive skeleton standing there
as if the rest of the creature had that moment disappeared. It had
four thick boned legs, but otherwise resembled no animal Egwene had
ever seen. For one thing, it had to stand at least two spans high,
well over twice her height. The rounded skull, set low on the
shoulders like a bull&rsquo;s, looked big enough for a child to climb
inside, and in the picture it seemed to have four eye sockets. The
skeleton marked the room off from any other; there was no mistaking
it for anything but itself. Whatever it was. If Eurian Romavni had
known, he had not named it in these pages.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is a panarch, anyway?&rdquo; she asked, laying the
book aside. She had studied the picture a dozen times. &ldquo;All of
these writers seem to think you know already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Panarch of Tanchico is the equal of the king in
authority,&rdquo; Elayne recited. &ldquo;She is responsible for collecting
taxes, customs and duties; he for spending them properly. She
controls the Civil Watch and the courts, except for the High Court,
which is the king&rsquo;s. The army is his, of course, except for the
Panarch&rsquo;s Legion. She&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t really want to know.&rdquo; Egwene sighed. It had
only been something to say, another few moments to delay what she
was going to do. The candle was burning down; she was wasting
precious minutes. She knew how to step out of the dream when she
wanted, how to wake herself, but time passed differently in the
World of Dreams, and it was easy to lose track. &ldquo;As soon as it
reaches the mark,&rdquo; she said, and Elayne and Nynaeve murmured
reassurances.</p>

<p>Settling back on her feather pillows, at first she
only stared at the ceiling, painted with blue sky and clouds and
swooping swallows. She did not see them.</p>

<p>Her dreams had been bad enough lately, most of them.
Rand was in them, of course. Rand as tall as a mountain, walking
through cities, crushing buildings beneath his feet, with screaming
people like ants fleeing from him. Rand in chains, and it was he
who was screaming. Rand building a wall with him on one side and
her on the other, her and Elayne and others she could not make out.
&ldquo;It has to be done,&rdquo; he was saying as he piled up stones. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not
let you stop me now.&rdquo; These were not the only nightmares. She had
dreamed of Aiel fighting each other, killing each other, even
throwing away their weapons and running as if they had gone mad.
Mat wrestling with a Seanchan woman who tied an invisible leash to
him. A wolf&mdash;she was sure it was Perrin, though&mdash;fighting a man whose face kept changing. Galad wrapping himself in
white as though putting on his own shroud, and Gawyn with his eyes
full of pain and hatred. Her mother weeping. They were the sharp
dreams, the ones she knew meant something. They were hideous, and
she did not know what any of them meant. How could she presume to
think she could find any meanings or clues in
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod!</em> But there was no other choice. No other
choice but ignorance, and she could not choose that.</p>

<p>Despite her anxiety, going to sleep was no problem;
she was exhausted. It was just a matter of closing her eyes and
taking deep, regular breaths. She fixed in her thoughts the room in
the Panarch&rsquo;s Palace and the huge skeleton. Deep, regular breaths.
She could remember how using the stone ring felt, the step into
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. Deep&mdash;regular&mdash;breaths.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Egwene stepped back with a gasp, one hand to her
throat. This close, the skeleton seemed even larger than she had
thought, the bones bleached dull and dry. She stood right in front
of it, inside the rope. A white rope, as thick as her wrist and
apparently silk. She had no doubt this was <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>.
The detail was as fine as reality, even for things half seen from
the corner of her eye. That she could even be aware of the
differences between this and an ordinary dream told her where she
was. Besides, it felt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;right.</p>

<p>She opened herself to <em>saidar</em>. A nick on the
finger in the World of Dreams would still be there on waking; there
would be no waking from a killing stroke with the Power, or even
from a sword, or a club. She did not intend to be vulnerable for an
instant.</p>

<p>Instead of her shift, she wore something very much
like Aviendha&rsquo;s Aiel garb, but in red brocaded silk; even her soft
boots, laced to the knee, were supple red leather, suitable for
gloves, with gold stitching and laces. She laughed softly to
herself. Clothes in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> were what you wanted
them to be. Apparently part of her mind wanted to be ready to move
quickly, while another part wanted to be ready for a ball. It would
not do. The red faded to grays and browns; the coat and breeches
and boots became exact copies of the Maidens&rsquo;. No better, really,
not in a city. Abruptly she was in a copy of the dresses Faile
always wore, dark, with narrow divided skirts, long sleeves and a
high snug bodice. <em>Foolish to worry about it. No one is going to
see me except in their dreams, and few ordinary dreams reach here.
It would make no difference if I were naked</em>.</p>

<p>For a moment she <em>was</em> naked. Her face colored
with embarrassment; there was no one there to see her bare as in
her bath, before she hastily brought the dark dress back, but she
should have remembered how stray thoughts could affect things here,
especially when you had embraced the Power. Elayne and Nynaeve
thought she was so knowledgeable. She knew a few of the rules of
the Unseen World, and knew there were a hundred, a thousand more of
which she was ignorant. Somehow, she had to learn them, if she was
to be the Tower&rsquo;s first Dreamer since Corianin.</p>

<p>She took a closer look at the huge skull. She had
grown up in a country village, and she knew what animal bones
looked like. Not four eye sockets after all. Two seemed to be for
tusks of some kind instead, on either side of where its nose had
been. Some sort of monstrous boar, perhaps, though it looked like
no pig skull she had ever seen. It had a feel of age, though; great
age.</p>

<p>With the Power in her, she could sense things like
that, here. The usual enhancement of senses was with her, of
course. She could feel tiny cracks in the gilded plaster bosses
covering the ceiling fifty feet up, and the smooth polish of the
white stone floor. Infinitesimal cracks, invisible to the eye,
spread across the floor stones as well.</p>

<p>The chamber was huge, perhaps two hundred paces long
and nearly half as wide, with rows of thin white columns, and that
white rope running all the way around except where there were
doorways, with double pointed arches. More ropes encircled polished
wooden stands and cabinets holding other exhibits out in the floor.
Up under the ceiling, an elaborate pattern of tiny carvings pierced
the walls, letting in plenty of light. Apparently she had dreamed
herself into a Tanchico where it was day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A grand display of artifacts of Ages long past, of
the Age of Legends and Ages before, open to all, even the common
folk, three days in the month and on feastdays,&rdquo; Eurian Romavni had
written. He had spoken in glowing terms of the priceless display of
<em>cuendillar</em> figures, six of them, in a glass sided case in
the center of the hall, always watched by four of the Panarch&rsquo;s
personal guards when people were allowed in, and had gone on for
two pages about the bones of fabulous beasts &ldquo;never seen alive by
the eyes of man.&rdquo; Egwene could see some of those. On one side of
the room was the skeleton of something that looked a little like a
bear, if a bear had two front teeth as long as her forearm, and
opposite it on the other side were the bones of some slender, four
footed beast with a neck so long the skull was half as high as the
ceiling. There were more, spaced down the chamber&rsquo;s walls, just as
fantastic. All of them felt old enough to make the Stone of Tear
seem new built. Ducking under the rope barrier, she walked down the
chamber slowly, staring.</p>

<p>A weathered stone figurine of a woman, seemingly
unclothed but wrapped in hair that fell to her ankles, was
outwardly no different from the others sharing its case, each not
much bigger than her hand. But it gave an impression of soft warmth
that she recognized. It was an <em>angreal</em>, she was sure; she
wondered why the Tower had not managed to get it away from the
Panarch. A finely jointed collar and two bracelets of dull black
metal, on a stand by themselves, made her shiver; she felt darkness
and pain associated with them&mdash;old, old pain, and sharp. A
silvery thing in another cabinet, like a three pointed star inside
a circle, was made of no substance she knew; it was softer than
metal, scratched and gouged, yet even older than any of the ancient
bones. From ten paces she could sense pride and vanity.</p>

<p>One thing actually seemed familiar, though she could
not say why. Tucked into a corner of one of the cabinets, as if
whoever put it there had been uncertain that it was worthy of
display, lay the upper half of a broken figure carved from some
shiny white stone, a woman holding a crystal sphere in one upraised
hand, her face calm and dignified and full of wise authority.
Whole, she would have been perhaps a foot tall. But why did she
appear so familiar? She almost seemed to call to Egwene to pick her
up.</p>

<p>Not until Egwene&rsquo;s fingers closed on the broken
statuette did she realize she had climbed over the rope.
<em>Foolish, when I don&rsquo;t know what it is</em>, she thought, but it
was already too late.</p>

<p>As her hand grasped it, the Power surged within her,
into the half figure then back into her, into the figure and back,
in and back. The crystal sphere flickered in fitful, lurid flashes,
and needles stabbed her brain with each flash. With a sob of agony,
she loosed her hold and clasped both hands to her head.</p>

<p>The crystal sphere shattered as the figure hit the
floor and broke into pieces, and the needles vanished, leaving only
dull memories of the pain and a queasiness that wobbled her knees.
She squeezed her eyes shut so she could not see the room heaving.
The figure had to be a <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, but why had it hurt
her like that when she only touched it? Perhaps because it was
broken; perhaps, broken, it could not do what it was meant for. She
did not even want to think of what it might have been made for;
testing <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> was dangerous. At least it must be
broken beyond danger now. Here, at least. <em>Why did it seem to
call me?</em></p>

<p>Nausea faded, and she opened her eyes. The figure was
back on the shelf, as whole as it had been when she first saw it.
Strange things happened in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, but that was
stranger than she wanted to see. And this was not what she had come
for. First she had to find her way out of the Panarch&rsquo;s Palace.
Climbing back over the rope, she hurried out of the chamber, trying
not to run.</p>

<p>The palace was empty of life, of course. Human life,
at least. Colorful fish swam in large fountains that splashed
merrily in the courtyards surrounded by delicately columned walks
and balconies screened by stonework like intricately carved lace.
Lily pads floated on the waters, and white flowers as big as dinner
plates. In the World of Dreams, a place was as it was in the
so-called real world. Except for people. Elaborate golden lamps
stood in the hallways, wicks uncharred, but she could smell the
perfumed oil in them. Her feet raised no hint of dust from the
bright carpets that surely could never have been beaten, not
here.</p>

<p>Once she did see another person walking ahead of her,
a man in gilded, ornately worked plate and mail armor, a pointed
golden helmet crested with white egret plumes under his arm.
&ldquo;Aeldra?&rdquo; he called, smiling. &ldquo;Aeldra, come look at me. I am named
the Lord Captain of the Panarch&rsquo;s Legion. Aeldra?&rdquo; He walked on
another pace, still calling, and suddenly was not there. Not a
Dreamer. Not even someone using a <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> like her
stone ring or Amico&rsquo;s iron disc. Only a man whose dream had touched
a place he was not aware of, with dangers he did not know. People
who died unexpectedly in their sleep had often dreamed their way
into <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> and in truth had died there. He was
well out of it, back into an ordinary dream.</p>

<p>The candle was burning down beside that bed back in
Tear. Her time in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> was burning away.</p>

<p>Hastening her steps, she came to tall, carved doors
leading outside, to wide white stairs and a huge empty square.
Tanchico spread out in every direction across steep hills, white
buildings upon white buildings shining in the sun, hundreds of thin
towers and almost as many pointed domes, some gilded. The Panarch&rsquo;s
Circle, a tall round wall of white stone, stood in plain sight not
half a mile away and a little lower than the palace. The Panarch&rsquo;s
Palace rose atop one of the loftiest hills. At the top of the deep
stairs, she was high enough to see water glinting to the west,
inlets separating her from more hilly fingers where the rest of the
city lay. Tanchico was larger than Tear, perhaps larger than
Caemlyn.</p>

<p>So much to search, and she did not even know for
what. For something that signified the presence of the Black Ajah,
or something that indicated some sort of danger to Rand, if either
existed here. Had she been a real Dreamer, trained in the use of
her talent, she would surely have known what to look for, how to
interpret what she saw. But no one remained who could teach her.
Aiel Wise Ones supposedly knew how to decipher dreams. Aviendha had
been so reluctant to talk about the Wise Ones that Egwene had not
asked any of the other Aiel. Perhaps a Wise One could teach her. If
she could find one.</p>

<p>She took a step toward the square, and suddenly she
was somewhere else.</p>

<p>Great stone spires rose around her in a heat that
sucked the moisture out of her breath. The sun seemed to bake right
through her dress, and the breeze blowing in her face seemed to
come from a stove. Stunted trees dotted a landscape almost bare of
other growth, except for a few patches of tough grass and some
prickly plants she did not recognize. She recognized the lion,
however, even if she had never seen one in the flesh. It lay in a
crevice in the rocks not twenty paces away, black tufted tail
switching idly, looking not at her but at something another hundred
strides on. The large boar covered in coarse hair was rooting and
snuffling at the base of a thorny bush, never noticing the Aiel
woman creeping up on it with a spear ready to thrust. Garbed like
the Aiel in the Stone, she had her <em>shoufa</em> around her head
but her face uncovered.</p>

<p><em>The Waste</em>, Egwene thought incredulously.
<em>I&rsquo;ve jumped into the Aiel Waste! When will I learn to watch
what I think here?</em></p>

<p>The Aiel woman froze. Her eyes were on Egwene now,
not the boar. If it was a boar; it did not seem to be shaped
exactly right.</p>

<p>Egwene was sure the woman was not a Wise One. Not
dressed like a Maiden, from what Egwene had been told, a Maiden of
the Spear who wanted to become a Wise One had to &ldquo;give up the
spear.&rdquo; This had to be just an Aiel woman who had dreamed herself
into <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, like that fellow in the palace. He
would have seen her, too, if he had ever turned around. Egwene
closed her eyes and concentrated on her one clear image of
Tanchico, that huge skeleton in the great hall.</p>

<p>When she opened them again, she was staring at the
massive bones. They had been wired together, she noticed this time.
Quite cleverly, so that the wires hardly showed at all. The half
figurine with its crystal sphere was still on its shelf. She did
not go near it, any more than the black collar and bracelets that
felt of so much pain and suffering. The <em>angreal</em>, the stone
woman, was a temptation. <em>What are you going to do with it?
Light, you&rsquo;re here to look, to search! Nothing more than that. Get
on with it, woman!</em></p>

<p>This time she quickly found her way back to the
square. Time passed differently here; Elayne and Nynaeve could be
waking her up any moment, and she still had not even begun. There
might be no more minutes to waste. She had to be careful of what
she thought from here on. No more thinking about the Wise Ones.
Even the admonition made everything lurch around her. <em>Keep your
mind on what you are doing</em>, she told herself firmly.</p>

<p>She set out through the empty city, walking fast,
sometimes trotting. Winding, stone paved streets slanted up and
down, curving every which way, all empty, except for green backed
pigeons and pale gray gulls that rose in thunderclaps of wings when
she came close. Why birds and not people? Flies buzzed by, and she
could see roaches and beetles scurrying along in the shadows. A
pack of lean dogs, all different colors, loped across the street
far ahead of her. Why dogs?</p>

<p>She pulled herself back to why she was there. What
would be a sign of the Black Ajah? Or of this danger to Rand, if it
existed? Most of the white buildings were plastered, the plaster
chipped and cracked, often showing weathered wood or pale brown
brick beneath. Only the towers and the larger structures&mdash;palaces, she supposed&mdash;were stone, if still white. Even the
stone had tiny fissures, though, most of it; cracks too minute for
the eye to catch, but she could feel them with the Power in her,
spiderwebbing domes and towers. Perhaps that meant something.
Perhaps it meant Tanchico was a city not looked after by its
inhabitants. As likely that as anything else.</p>

<p>She jumped as a shrieking man suddenly plummeted out
of the sky in front of her. She only had time to register baggy
white trousers and thick mustaches covered by a transparent veil
before he vanished, only a pace above the pavement. Had he struck,
here in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, he would have been found dead in
his bed.</p>

<p><em>He probably has as much to do with anything as
the roaches</em>, she told herself.</p>

<p>Perhaps something inside the buildings. It was a
small chance, a wild hope, but she was desperate enough to try
anything. Almost anything. Time. How much time did she have left?
She began running from doorway to doorway, putting her head into
shops and inns and houses.</p>

<p>Tables and benches stood in common rooms awaiting
customers, as neatly arranged as the dully gleaming pewter mugs and
plates on their shelves. The shops were as tidy as if the
shopkeeper had just opened for the morning, yet while a tailor&rsquo;s
tables held bolts of cloth, and a cutler&rsquo;s knives and scissors, the
ceiling hooks hung empty in a butcher&rsquo;s shop and the shelves stood
bare. A finger run along anywhere picked up no dust at all;
everything was clean enough to suit her mother.</p>

<p>In the narrower streets there were homes, small
simple white plastered buildings with flat roofs and no windows
onto the street, ready for families to walk in and sit on benches
before cold fireplaces or around narrow tables with carved legs
where a goodwife&rsquo;s best bowl or platter was given pride of place.
Clothes hung on pegs, pots hung from ceilings, handtools lay on
benches, waiting.</p>

<p>On a hunch she retraced her steps once, just to see,
back a dozen doors, and peered a second time into what was some
woman&rsquo;s home in the real world. It was almost the way it had been.
Almost. The red striped bowl that had been on the table was now a
narrow blue vase; one of the benches, on it a broken harness and
the tools for mending it, that had been near the fireplace now sat
by the door holding a darning basket and a child&rsquo;s embroidered
dress.</p>

<p><em>Why did it change!</em> she wondered. <em>But for
that matter, why should it stay the same? Light, I don&rsquo;t know
anything!</em></p>

<p>There was a stable across the street, the white
plaster showing large patches of brick. She trotted to it and
pulled open one of the big doors. Straw covered the dirt floor,
just as in every stable she had ever seen, but the stalls stood
empty. No horses. Why? Something rustled in the straw, and she
realized the stalls were not empty after all. Rats. Dozens of them,
staring at her boldly, noses testing the air for her scent. None of
the rats ran, or even shied away; they behaved as if they had more
right there than she. In spite of herself she stepped back.
<em>Pigeons and gulls and dogs, flies and rats. Maybe a Wise One
would know why</em>.</p>

<p>As suddenly as that she was back in the Waste.</p>

<p>With a scream she fell flat on her back as the hairy
boarlike creature darted straight for her, looking as large as a
small pony. Not a pig, she saw as it leaped nimbly over her; the
snout was too sharp and full of keen teeth, and it had four toes on
each foot. The thought was calm, but she shuddered as the beast
scampered away through the rocks. It was big enough to have
trampled her, breaking bones and worse; those teeth could have
ripped and torn as well as any wolf&rsquo;s. She would have awakened with
the wounds. If she had waked at all.</p>

<p>The gritty rock under her back was a blistering
stovetop. She scrambled to her feet, angry with herself. If she
could not keep her mind on what she was doing, she would accomplish
nothing. Tanchico was where she was supposed to be; she had to
concentrate on that. Nothing else.</p>

<p>She stopped brushing at her skirts when she saw the
Aiel woman watching her with sharp blue eyes from ten paces off.
The woman was Aviendha&rsquo;s age, no older than herself, but the wisps
of hair that stuck out from under her <em>shoufa</em> were so pale
as to be almost white. The spear in her hands was ready to be cast,
and at that distance she was not likely to miss.</p>

<p>The Aiel were said to be more than rough with those
who entered the Waste without permission. Egwene knew she could
wrap woman and spear in Air, hold them safely, but would the flows
keep long enough when she began to fade? Or would they just anger
the woman enough to make her cast her spear the moment she was
able, perhaps before Egwene was truly gone? Much good it would do
to take herself back to Tanchico with an Aiel spear through her. If
she tied the flows, that would leave the woman trapped in
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> until they were unraveled, helpless if that
lion or the boarlike creature returned.</p>

<p>No. She simply needed the woman to lower her spear,
just long enough to feel safe closing her eyes, to take herself
back to Tanchico. Back to what she was supposed to be doing. She
had no more time for these flights of fancy. She was not entirely
sure someone who had only dreamed themselves into
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> could harm her the way other things there
could, but she was not going to risk finding out with an Aiel spear
point. The Aiel woman should vanish in a few moments. Something to
put her off balance until then.</p>

<p>Changing her clothes was easy; as soon as the thought
came, Egwene was wearing the same browns and grays as the woman. &ldquo;I
mean you no harm,&rdquo; she said, outwardly calm.</p>

<p>The woman did not lower her weapon. Instead, she
frowned and said, &ldquo;You have no right to wear <em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em>,
girl.&rdquo; And Egwene found herself standing there in her skin, the sun
burning her from overhead, the ground searing her bare feet.</p>

<p>For a moment she gaped in disbelief, dancing from
foot to foot. She had not thought it possible to change things
about someone else. So many possibilities, so many rules, that she
did not know. Hurriedly she thought herself back into stout shoes
and the dark dress with its divided skirts and at the same time
made the Aiel woman&rsquo;s garments vanish. She had to draw on
<em>saidar</em> to do it; the woman must have been concentrating on
keeping Egwene naked. She had a flow ready to seize the spear if
the other woman made to throw it.</p>

<p>It was the Aiel woman&rsquo;s turn to look shocked. She let
the spear fall to her side, too, and Egwene seized the moment to
shut her eyes and take herself back to Tanchico, back to the
skeleton of that huge boar. Or whatever it was. She barely gave it
a second glance this time. She was growing tired of things that
looked like boars and were not. <em>How did she</em> do <em>that?
No! It&rsquo;s wondering about how and why that keeps pulling me off the
path. This time I&rsquo;ll stick to it</em>.</p>

<p>She did hesitate, though. Just as she had closed her
eyes it had seemed she saw another woman, beyond the Aiel woman,
watching them both. A golden haired woman holding a silver bow.
<em>You are letting wild fancies take you, now. You&rsquo;ve been
listening to too many of Thom Merrilin&rsquo;s stories</em>. Brigitte
was long dead; she could not come again until the Horn of
Valere called her back from the grave. Dead women, even heroes
of legend, surely could not dream themselves into
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>.</p>

<p>It was only a moment&rsquo;s pause, though. Shutting off
futile speculation, she ran back to the square. How much time did
she have left? The whole city to search, and time slipping away,
and she as ignorant as when she started. If only she had some idea
of what to look for. Or where. Running did not seem to tire her
here in the World of Dreams, but run as hard as she might, she
would never cover the entire city before Elayne and Nynaeve woke
her. She did not want to have to come back.</p>

<p>A woman appeared suddenly among the flock of pigeons
that had gathered in the square. Her gown was pale green, thin and
draped closely enough to have satisfied Berelain, her dark hair
was in dozens of narrow braids, and her face was covered to the
eyes by a transparent veil like the one the falling man had worn.
The pigeons soared up, and so did the woman gliding over the
nearest rooftops with them before abruptly winking out of
existence.</p>

<p>Egwene smiled. She dreamed of flying like a bird all
the time, and this was a dream, after all. She leaped into the air,
and kept going up, toward the roofs. She wobbled as she thought how
ridiculous this was&mdash;Flying? People did not fly!&mdash;then
steadied again as she forced herself to be confident. She was doing
it, and that was all there was to it. This was a dream, and she was
flying. The wind rushed in her face, and she wanted to laugh
giddily.</p>

<p>She skimmed across the Panarch&rsquo;s Circle, where rows
of stone benches slanted down from the high wall to a broad field
of packed dirt in the center. Imagine so many people gathered, and
to watch a fireworks display by the Guild of Illuminators
themselves. Back home fireworks were a rare treat. She could
remember the handful of times in her life Emond&rsquo;s Field had had
them, with the grownups as excited as the children.</p>

<p>She sailed over rooftops like a falcon, over palaces
and mansions, humble dwellings and shops, warehouses and stables.
She slid by domes topped with golden spires and bronze
weathervanes, by towers ringed with lacy stone balconies. Carts and
wagons dotted wagon yards, waiting. Ships crowded the great harbor
and the fingers of water between the city&rsquo;s peninsulas; they lined
the docks. Everything seemed in a poor state of repair, from the
carts to the ships, but nothing she saw pointed to the Black Ajah.
As far as she knew.</p>

<p>She considered trying to envision Liandrin&mdash;she
knew that doll&rsquo;s face all too well, with its multitude of blond
braids, its self-satisfied brown eyes, and its smirking rosebud
mouth&mdash;picture her in the hopes she might be drawn to where
the Black sister was. But if it worked, she might find Liandrin in
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, too, and maybe others of them. She was not
ready for that.</p>

<p>It suddenly occurred to her that if any of the Black
Ajah were in Tanchico, in the Tanchico of <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>,
she was flaunting herself for them. Any eye looking at the sky
would notice a woman flying, one who did not vanish after a few
moments. Her smooth flight staggered, and she swooped down below
roof level, floating along the streets more slowly than before but
still faster than a horse could ran. She might be rushing toward
them, but she could not make herself stop and wait for them.</p>

<p><em>Fool</em>, she called herself furiously. <em>Fool!
They could know I&rsquo;m here now. They could be laying a trap
already</em>. She considered stepping out of the dream, back to her
bed in Tear, but she had found nothing. If there was anything to
find.</p>

<p>A tall woman was suddenly standing in the street
ahead of her, slim in a bulky brown skirt and loose white blouse,
with a brown shawl around her shoulders and a folded scarf around
her forehead to hold white hair that spilled to her waist. Despite
her plain clothes she wore a great many necklaces and bracelets of
gold or ivory or both. Fists planted on her hips, she stared
straight at Egwene, frowning.</p>

<p><em>Another fool woman who&rsquo;s dreamed herself where
she has no right to be and doesn&rsquo;t believe what she&rsquo;s seeing</em>,
Egwene thought. She had the description of every woman who had gone
with Liandrin, and this woman certainly matched none of them. But
the woman did not vanish again; she stood there as Egwene
approached swiftly. <em>Why doesn&rsquo;t she go? Why</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>?
Oh, Light! She&rsquo;s really</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>!</em> She snatched for the
flows to weave lightning, to tangle the woman in Air, fumbling in
startled haste.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put your feet on the ground, girl,&rdquo; the woman
barked. &ldquo;I had enough trouble finding you again without you flying
off like some bird when I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly Egwene stopped flying. Her feet thumped hard
on the pavement, and she staggered. It was the Aiel woman&rsquo;s voice,
but this was an older woman. Not as old as Egwene had thought at
first&mdash;in fact, she looked much younger than her white hair
suggested&mdash;but with the voice, and those sharp blue eyes, she
was sure it was the same woman. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;different,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can be what you wish to be, here.&rdquo; The woman
sounded embarrassed, but only a little. &ldquo;At times I like to
remember&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;That is not important. You are from the White Tower?
It has been long since they had a dreamwalker. Very long. I am
Amys, of the Nine Valleys sept of the Taardad Aiel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a Wise One? You are! And you know dreams,
you know <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod!</em> You can&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;My name is Egwene.
Egwene al&rsquo;Vere. I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She took a deep breath; Amys did not look
a woman to lie to. &ldquo;I am Aes Sedai. Of the Green Ajah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amys&rsquo;s expression did not change, really. A slight
crinkling of her eyes, perhaps in skepticism. Egwene hardly looked
old enough to be full Aes Sedai. What she said, though, was &ldquo;I
meant to leave you standing in your skin until you asked for some
proper clothes. Putting on <em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em> that way, as though
you were&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;You surprised me, pulling free as you did, turning
my own spear on me. But you are still untaught, are you not,
however strong. Else you would not have popped into the middle of
my hunt that way, where you obviously did not wish to be. And this
flying about? Did you come to <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>&mdash;<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>!&mdash;to stare at this city, wherever it
is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Tanchico,&rdquo; Egwene said faintly. <em>She didn&rsquo;t
know</em>. But then how had Amys followed her, or found her? It was
obvious she knew more of the World of Dreams than Egwene did, by
far. &ldquo;You can help me. I am trying to find women of the Black Ajah,
Darkfriends. I think they are here, and I have to find them if they
are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It truly exists, then.&rdquo; Amys almost whispered it.
&ldquo;An Ajah of Shadowrunners in the White Tower.&rdquo; She shook her head,
&ldquo;You are like a girl just wedded to the spear who thinks now she
can wrestle men and leap mountains. For her it means a few bruises
and a valuable lesson in humility. For you, here, it could mean
death.&rdquo; Amys eyed the white buildings around them and grimaced.
&ldquo;Tanchico? In&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Tarabon? This city is dying, eating itself.
There is a darkness here, an evil. Worse than men can make. Or
women.&rdquo; She looked at Egwene pointedly. &ldquo;You cannot see it, or feel
it, can you? And you want to hunt Shadowrunners in
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Evil?&rdquo; Egwene said quickly. &ldquo;That could be them. Are
you sure? If I told you what they look like, could you be certain
it was them? I can describe them. I can describe one to her last
braid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A child,&rdquo; Amys muttered, &ldquo;demanding a silver
bracelet from her father this minute when she knows nothing of
trading or the making of bracelets. You have much to learn. Far
more than I can begin to teach you, now. Come to the Three-fold
Land. I will have the word spread through the clans that an Aes
Sedai called Egwene al&rsquo;Vere is to be brought to me at Cold Rocks
Hold. Give your name and show your Great Serpent ring, and you will
have safe running. I am not there now, but I will return from
Rhuidean before you can arrive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, you must help me. I need to know if they are
here. I have to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I cannot tell you. I do not know them, or this
place, this Tanchico. You must come to me. What you do is
dangerous, far more dangerous than you know. You must&mdash;Where
are you going? Stay!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something seemed to snatch at Egwene, pulling her
into darkness.</p>

<p>Amys&rsquo;s voice followed her, hollow and dwindling. &ldquo;You
must come to me and learn. You must&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>
