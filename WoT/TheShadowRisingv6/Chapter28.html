<h4><em>To the Tower of Ghenjei</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">W</span>ith
night so near, they had no choice but to camp
there on the mountain near the Waygate. In two camps. Faile
insisted on it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is done with,&rdquo; Loial told her in a displeased
rumble. &ldquo;We are out of the Ways, and I have kept my oath. It is
finished.&rdquo; Faile put on one of her stubborn expressions, with chin
up and fists on hips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave it alone, Loial,&rdquo; Perrin said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll camp over
there a bit.&rdquo; Loial glanced at Faile, who had turned to the two
Aiel women as soon as she heard Perrin agree, then shook his huge
head and made as if to join Perrin and Gaul. Perrin motioned him
back, with a small gesture he hoped none of the women noticed.</p>

<p>He made it a small bit, less than twenty paces. The
Waygate might be locked, but there were still the ravens, and
whatever they might presage. He wanted to be near if needed. If
Faile complained, she could just complain. He was so set to ignore
her protests that it irked him when she made none.</p>

<p>Disregarding twinges from his leg and side, he
unsaddled Stepper and unloaded the packhorse, hobbled both animals
and fitted them with nose bags with a few handfuls of barley and
some oats. There was certainly no grazing up here. As to what there
was, though&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He strung his bow and laid it across his quiver
near the fire, slipped the axe free of its belt loop.</p>

<p>Gaul joined him in making a fire, and they had a meal
of bread and cheese and dried beef, eaten in silence and washed
down with water. The sun slid behind the mountains, silhouetting
the peaks and painting the undersides of the clouds red. Shadows
blanketed the valley, and the air began to grow crisp.</p>

<p>Dusting crumbs from his hands, Perrin dug his good
green wool cloak out of his saddlebags. Perhaps he had grown more
accustomed to Tear&rsquo;s heat than he had thought. The women were
certainly not eating in silence around their shadow-shrouded fire;
he could hear them laughing, and the bits of what they said that he
picked up made his ears burn. Women would talk about anything; they
had no restraint at all. Loial had moved as far away from them as
he could and still be in the light, and was trying to bury himself
in a book. They probably did not even realize they were
embarrassing the Ogier; they probably thought they were talking
quietly enough for Loial not to hear.</p>

<p>Muttering to himself, Perrin sat back down across the
fire from Gaul. The Aiel seemed to be taking no notice of the
chill. &ldquo;Do you know any funny stories?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Funny stories? I cannot think of one, offhand.&rdquo;
Gaul&rsquo;s eyes half turned to the other fire, and the laughter. &ldquo;I
would if I could. The sun, remember?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin laughed noisily and made his voice loud enough
to carry. &ldquo;I do. Women!&rdquo; The hilarity in the other camp faded for a
moment before rising again. That should show them. Other people
could laugh. Perrin stared glumly into the fire. His wounds
ached.</p>

<p>After a moment, Gaul said, &ldquo;This place begins to look
more like the Three-fold Land than most of the wetlands. Too much
water, still, and the trees are still too big and too many, but it
is not so strange as the places called forests.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The soil was poor here where Manetheren had died in
fire, the widely scattered trees all stunted and thick-boled, odd
wind-bent shapes, none as much as thirty feet high. Perrin thought
it about as desolate a spot as he had ever seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could see your Three-fold Land someday,
Gaul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you will, when we are done here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo; Not much chance of it, of course. None,
really. He could have told the Aielman that, but he did not want to
talk of it now, or think of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is where Manetheren stood? You are of
Manetheren&rsquo;s blood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This was Manetheren,&rdquo; Perrin replied. &ldquo;And I suppose
I am.&rdquo; It was hard to believe that the small villages and quiet
farms of the Two Rivers held the last of Manetheren&rsquo;s blood, but
that was what Moiraine had said. The old blood runs strong in the
Two Rivers, she had said. &ldquo;That was a long time ago, Gaul. We are
farmers, shepherds; not a great nation, not great warriors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gaul smiled slightly. &ldquo;If you say it. I have seen you
dance the spears, and Rand al&rsquo;Thor, and the one called Mat. But if
you say it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin shifted uncomfortably. How much had he changed
since leaving home? Himself, and Rand, and Mat? Not his eyes, and
the wolves, or Rand&rsquo;s channeling; he did not mean that. How much of
what was inside remained unchanged? Mat was the only one who still
seemed to be just himself, only more so. &ldquo;You know about
Manetheren?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know more of your world than you think. And less
than we believed. Long before I crossed the Dragonwall I had read
books brought by peddlers. I knew of &lsquo;ships&rsquo; and &lsquo;rivers&rsquo; and
&lsquo;forests,&rsquo; or thought I did.&rdquo; Gaul made them sound like words in a
strange tongue. &ldquo;This is how I envisioned a &lsquo;forest.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; He gestured
at the sparse trees, dwarfed from the height they should have had.
&ldquo;To believe a thing is not to make it true. What of the
Nightrunner, and Leafblighter&rsquo;s get? Do you believe it just
coincidence they came near this Waygate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Perrin sighed. &ldquo;I saw ravens, down the valley.
Maybe that&rsquo;s all they were, but I don&rsquo;t want to take the chance,
not after the Trollocs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gaul nodded. &ldquo;They could have been Shadoweyes. If you
plan for the worst, all surprises are pleasant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could do with a pleasant surprise.&rdquo; Perrin felt
for wolves again, and again found nothing. &ldquo;I may be able to find
out something tonight. Maybe. If anything happens here, you might
have to kick me to wake me.&rdquo; That sounded odd, he realized, but
Gaul only nodded again. &ldquo;Gaul, you&rsquo;ve never mentioned my eyes, or
even given them a second glance. None of the Aiel have.&rdquo; He knew
they were glowing golden now, in the firelight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The world is changing,&rdquo; Gaul said quietly. &ldquo;Rhuarc,
and Jheran, my own clan chief&mdash;the Wise Ones, too&mdash;they
tried to hide it, but they were uneasy when they sent us across the
Dragonwall searching for He Who Comes With the Dawn. I think
perhaps the change will not be what we have always believed. I do
not know how it will be different, but it will be. The Creator put
us in the Three-fold Land to shape us as well as to punish our sin,
but for what have we been shaped?&rdquo; He shook his head suddenly,
ruefully. &ldquo;Colinda, the Wise One of Hot Springs Hold, tells me I
think too much for a Stone Dog, and Bair, the eldest Wise One of
the Shaarad, threatens to send me to Rhuidean when Jheram dies
whether I want to go or not. Beside all of that, Perrin, what does
the color of a man&rsquo;s eyes matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish everybody thought that way.&rdquo; The merriment
had finally stopped at the other fire. One of the Aiel women&mdash;Perrin could not tell which&mdash;was taking the first watch, her
back to the light, and everyone else had settled down for sleep. It
had been a tiring day. Sleep should be easy to find, and the dream
he needed. He stretched out beside the fire, pulling his cloak
around him. &ldquo;Remember. Kick me awake, if need be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sleep enfolded him while Gaul was still nodding, and
the dream came at once.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">It was daylight, and he stood alone near the Waygate,
which looked like an elegantly carved length of wall, incongruous
on the mountainside. Except for that there was no sign any human
had ever set foot on that slope. The sky was bright and fine, and a
soft breeze up the valley brought him the scent of deer and
rabbits, quail and dove, a thousand distinct smells, of water and
earth and trees. This was the wolf dream.</p>

<p>For a moment the sense of <em>being</em> a wolf
rolled over him. He had paws, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>No!</em> He ran his
hands over himself, relieved to find only his own body, in his own
coat and cloak. And the wide belt that normally held his axe, but
with the hammer haft thrust through the loop instead.</p>

<p>He frowned at that, and surprisingly, for a moment,
the axe flickered there instead, insubstantial and misty. Abruptly
it was the hammer again. Licking his lips, he hoped it stayed that
way. The axe might be a better weapon, but he preferred the hammer.
He could not remember anything like that happening before,
something changing, but he knew little of this strange place. If it
could be called a place. It was the wolf dream, and odd things
happened there, surely as odd as in any ordinary dream.</p>

<p>As though thinking of the oddities triggered one of
them, a patch of sky against the mountains darkened suddenly,
became a window to somewhere else. Rand stood amid swirling
stormwinds, laughing wildly, even madly, arms upraised, and on the
winds rode small shapes, gold and scarlet, like the strange figure
on the Dragon banner; hidden eyes watched Rand, and there was no
telling whether he knew it. The odd &ldquo;window&rdquo; winked out, only to be
replaced by another farther over, where Nynaeve and Elayne stalked
cautiously through a demented landscape of twisted, shadowed
buildings, hunting some dangerous beast. Perrin could not have said
how he knew it was dangerous, but he did. That vanished, and
another black blotch spread across the sky. Mat, standing where a
road forked ahead of him. He flipped a coin, started down one
branch, and suddenly was wearing a wide brimmed hat and walking
with a staff bearing a short sword blade. Another &ldquo;window,&rdquo; and
Egwene and a woman with long white hair were staring at him in
surprise while behind them the White Tower crumbled stone by stone.
Then they were gone, too.</p>

<p>Perrin drew a deep breath. He had seen the like
before, here in the wolf dream, and he thought the sightings were
real in some way, or meant something. Whatever they were, the
wolves never saw them. Moiraine had suggested that the wolf dream
was the same as something called <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, and then
would say no more. He had overheard Egwene and Elayne speaking of
dreams, once, but Egwene already knew too much about him and
wolves, perhaps as much as Moiraine. It was not something he could
talk about, not even with her.</p>

<p>There was one person he could have talked to. He
wished he could find Elyas Machera, the man who had introduced him
to the wolves. Elyas had to know about these things. When he
thought of the man, it seemed for a moment he heard his own name
whispered faintly in the wind, but when he listened, there was only
the wind. It was a lonely sound. Here there was only himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hopper!&rdquo; he called, and in his mind, <em>
Hopper!</em> The wolf was dead, and yet not dead, here. The wolf
dream was where wolves came when they died, to await being born
again. It was more than that, to wolves; they seemed in some way to
be aware of the dream even while awake. One was almost as real&mdash;maybe as real&mdash;as the other, to them. &ldquo;Hopper!&rdquo; <em>Hopper!</em> But
Hopper did not come.</p>

<p>This was all useless. He was there for a reason, and
he might as well get on with it. At best, getting down to where he
had seen the ravens rise would take hours.</p>

<p>He took a step&mdash;the land around him blurred&mdash;and his foot came down near a narrow brook beneath stunted
hemlock and mountain willow, with cloud-capped peaks towering
above. For a moment he stared in amazement. He was at the far end
of the valley from the Waygate. In fact, he was at the very spot he
had been aiming for, the place where the ravens had come from, and
the arrow that killed the first hawk. Such a thing had never
happened to him before. Was he learning more of the wolf dream&mdash;Hopper had always said he was ignorant&mdash;or was it
different this time?</p>

<p>He was more cautious with his next step, but it was
only a step. There was no evidence of archer or ravens, no track,
no feather, no scent. He was not sure what he had expected. There
would be no sign unless they had been in the dream, too. But if he
could find wolves in the dream, they could help him find their
brothers and sisters in the waking world, and those wolves could
tell him if there were Shadowspawn in the mountains. Perhaps if he
were higher up they could hear him call.</p>

<p>Fixing his eye on the highest peak bordering the
valley, just below the clouds, he stepped. The world blurred, and
he was standing on the mountainside, with white billows not five
spans overhead. In spite of himself, he laughed. This was fun. From
here he could see the entire valley stretched out below.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hopper!&rdquo; No answer.</p>

<p>He leaped to the next mountain, calling, and the
next, and the next, eastward, toward the Two Rivers. Hopper did not
answer. More troubling, Perrin did not sense any other wolves,
either. There were always wolves in the wolf dream. Always.</p>

<p>From peak to peak he sped in blurred motion, calling,
seeking. The mountains lay empty beneath him, except for deer and
other game. Yet there were occasional signs of men. Ancient signs.
Twice great carved figures took nearly an entire mountainside, and
in another place strange angular letters two spans high had been
incised across a cliff a shade too smooth and sheer. Weathering had
worn away the figures&rsquo; faces, and eyes less sharp than his might
have taken the letters themselves for the work of wind and rain.
Mountains and cliffs gave way to the Sand Hills, great rolling
mounds sparsely covered with tough grass and stubborn bushes, once
the shore of a great sea before the Breaking. And suddenly he saw
another man, atop a sandy hill.</p>

<p>The fellow was too distant to see clearly, just a
tall, dark-haired man, but plainly not a Trolloc or anything of the
sort, in a blue coat with a bow on his back, stooping over
something on the ground hidden by the low brush. Yet there was
something familiar about him.</p>

<p>The wind rose, and Perrin caught his smell faintly. A
cold scent, that was the only way to describe it. Cold, and not
really human. Suddenly his own bow was in his hand, an arrow
nocked, and the weight of a filled quiver tugged at his belt.</p>

<p>The other man looked up, saw Perrin. For a heartbeat
he hesitated, then turned and became a streak, slashing away across
the hills.</p>

<p>Perrin leaped down to where he had stood, stared at
what had occupied the fellow, and without thought pursued, leaving
the half-skinned corpse of a wolf behind. A dead wolf in the wolf
dream. It was unthinkable. What could kill a wolf here? Something
evil.</p>

<p>His prey ran ahead of him in strides that covered
miles, never more than barely in sight. Out of the hills and across
the tangled Westwood with its wide scattered farms, over cleared
farmland, a quilt of hedged fields and small thickets, and past
Watch Hill. It was odd to see the thatched village houses covering
the hill with no people in the streets, and farmhouses standing as
if abandoned. But he kept his eye on the man fleeing ahead of him.
He had become so used to this pursuit that he felt no surprise when
one leaping stride put him down on the south bank of the River
Taren and the next amid barren hills without trees or grass. North
and east he ran, over streams and roads and villages and rivers,
intent only on the man ahead. The land grew flat and grassy, broken
by scattered thickets, without any sign of man. Then something
glittered ahead, sparkling in the sun, a tower of metal. His quarry
sped straight for it, and vanished. Two leaps brought Perrin there
as well.</p>

<p>Two hundred feet the tower rose, and forty thick,
gleaming like burnished steel. It might as well have been a solid
column of metal. Perrin walked around it twice without seeing any
opening, not so much as a crack, not even a mark on that smooth,
sheer wall. The smell hung here, though, that cold, inhuman stink.
The trail ended here. The man&mdash;if man he was&mdash;had gone
inside somehow. He only had to find the way to follow.</p>

<p><em>Stop!</em> It was a raw flow of emotion that
Perrin&rsquo;s mind put a word to. <em>Stop!</em></p>

<p>He turned as a great gray wolf as tall as his waist,
grizzled and scarred, alighted as if he had just leaped down from
the sky. He might well have. Hopper had always envied eagles their
ability to fly, and here, he could too. Yellow eyes met yellow
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should I stop, Hopper? He killed a wolf.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Men have killed wolves, and wolves men. Why does
anger seize your throat like fire this time?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Perrin said slowly. &ldquo;Maybe because it
was here. I didn&rsquo;t know it was possible to kill a wolf here. I
thought wolves were safe in the dream.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>You chase Slayer, Young Bull. He is here in the
flesh, and he can kill</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the flesh? You mean not just dreaming? How can he
be here in the flesh?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>I do not know. It is a thing dimly remembered
from long ago, come again as so much else. Things of the Shadow
walk the dream, now. Creatures of Heartfang. There is no
safety</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s inside, now.&rdquo; Perrin studied the
featureless metal tower. &ldquo;If I can find how he got in, I can put an
end to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Cub foolish, digging in a groundwasps&rsquo; nest. This
place is evil. All know this. And you would chase evil into evil.
Slayer can kill</em>.</p>

<p>Perrin paused. There was a sense of finality to the
emotions his mind attached the word &ldquo;kill&rdquo; to. &ldquo;Hopper, what
happens to a wolf who dies in the dream?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wolf was silent for a time. <em>If we die here,
we die forever, Young Bull. I do not know if the same is true for
you, but I believe it is</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A dangerous place, archer. The Tower of Ghenjei is a
bad place for humankind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin whirled, half-raising his bow before he saw
the woman standing a few paces away, her golden hair in a thick
braid to her waist, almost the way women wore it in the Two Rivers,
but more intricately woven. Her clothes were oddly cut, a short
white coat and voluminous trousers of some thin pale yellow
material gathered at the ankles above short boots. Her dark cloak
seemed to hide something that glinted silver at her side.</p>

<p>She shifted, and the metallic flicker vanished. &ldquo;You
have sharp eyes, archer. I thought that the first time I saw
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How long had she been watching? It was embarrassing
that she had sneaked up without him hearing. At the least Hopper
should have warned him. The wolf was lying down in the knee high
grass, muzzle on his forepaws, watching him.</p>

<p>The woman seemed vaguely familiar, though Perrin was
certain he would have remembered her had he ever seen her before.
Who was she, to be in the wolf dream? Or was it Moiraine&rsquo;s <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, too? &ldquo;Are you Aes Sedai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, archer.&rdquo; She laughed. &ldquo;I only came to warn you,
despite the prescripts. Once entered, the Tower of Ghenjei is hard
enough to leave in the world of men. Here it is all but impossible.
You have a Bannerman&rsquo;s courage, which some say cannot be told from
foolhardiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Impossible to leave? The fellow&mdash;Slayer&mdash;surely had gone in. Why would he do that if he could not leave?
&ldquo;Hopper said it&rsquo;s dangerous, too. The Tower of Ghenjei? What is
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes widened, and she glanced at Hopper, who
still lay stretched out on the grass ignoring her and watching
Perrin. &ldquo;You can talk to wolves? Now that is a thing long lost in
legend. So that is how you are here. I should have known. The
tower? It is a doorway, archer, to the realms of the Aelfinn and
the Eelfinn.&rdquo; She said the names as if he should recognize them.
When he looked at her blankly, she said, &ldquo;Did you ever play the
game called Snakes and Foxes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All children do. At least, they do in the Two
Rivers. But they give it up when they get old enough to realize
there&rsquo;s no way to win.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Except to break the rules,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;Courage to
strengthen, fire to blind, music to daze, iron to bind.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a line from the game. I don&rsquo;t understand.
What does it have to do with this tower?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those are the ways to win against the snakes and the
foxes. The game is a remembrance of old dealings. It does not
matter so long as you stay away from the Aelfinn and the Eelfinn.
They are not evil the way the Shadow is evil, yet they are so
different from humankind they might as well be. They are not to be
trusted, archer. Stay clear of the Tower of Ghenjei. Avoid the
World of Dreams, if you can. Dark things walk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like the man I was chasing? Slayer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good name for him. This Slayer is not old, archer,
but his evil is ancient.&rdquo; She almost appeared to be leaning
slightly on something invisible; perhaps that silver thing he had
never quite seen. &ldquo;I seem to be telling you a great deal. I do not
understand why I spoke in the first place. Of course. Are you <em>
ta&rsquo;veren</em>, archer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; She seemed to know a lot about the
tower, and the wolf dream. <em>But she was surprised I could talk
to Hopper</em>. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve met you before somewhere, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have broken too many of the prescripts already,
archer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prescripts? What prescripts?&rdquo; A shadow fell on the
ground behind Hopper, and Perrin turned quickly, angry at being
caught by surprise again. There was no one there. But he had seen
it; the shadow of a man with the hilts of two swords rising above
his shoulders. Something about that image teased his memory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is right,&rdquo; the woman said behind him. &ldquo;I should
not be talking to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he turned back, she was gone. As far as he could
see were only grassland and scattered thickets. And the gleaming,
silvery tower.</p>

<p>He frowned at Hopper, who finally lifted his head
from his paws. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder you aren&rsquo;t attacked by chipmunks,&rdquo;
Perrin muttered. &ldquo;What did you make of her?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Her? A she?</em> Hopper stood, looking around.
<em>Where?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;I was talking to her. Right here. Just now.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>You made noises at the wind, Young Bull. There
was no she here. None but you and I</em>.</p>

<p>Perrin scratched his beard irritably. She had been
there. He had not been talking to himself. &ldquo;Strange things can
happen here,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;She agreed with you, Hopper. She
told me to stay away from this tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>She is wise</em>. There was an element of doubt
in the thought; Hopper still did not believe there had been any
&ldquo;she.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come awfully far afield from what I intended,&rdquo;
Perrin muttered. He explained his need to find wolves in the Two
Rivers, or the mountains above, explained about the ravens, and the
Trollocs in the Ways.</p>

<p>When he was done, Hopper remained silent for a long
time, his bushy tail held low and stiff. Finally&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Avoid
your old home, Young Bull</em>. The image Perrin&rsquo;s mind called
&ldquo;home&rdquo; was of the land marked by a wolfpack. <em>There are no
wolves there now. Those who were and did not flee are dead. Slayer
walks the dream there</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to go home, Hopper. I have to.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Take care, Young Bull. The day of the Last Hunt
draws near. We will run together in the Last Hunt</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; Perrin said sadly. It would be nice if he
could come here when he died; he was half wolf already, it seemed
sometimes. &ldquo;I have to go now, Hopper.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>May you know good hunting, Young Bull, and shes
to give you many cubs</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodbye, Hopper.&rdquo;</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">He opened his eyes to the dim light of dying coals on
the mountainside. Gaul was squatting just beyond the edge of the
light, watching the night. In the other camp, Faile was up, taking
her turn at guard. The moon hung above the mountains, turning the
clouds to pearly shadows. Perrin estimated he had been asleep two
hours.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep guard awhile,&rdquo; he said, tossing off his
cloak. Gaul nodded and settled himself on the ground where he was.
&ldquo;Gaul?&rdquo; The Aiel raised his head. &ldquo;It may be worse in the Two
Rivers than I thought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Things often are,&rdquo; Gaul replied quietly. &ldquo;It is the
way of life.&rdquo; The Aielman calmly put his head down for sleep.</p>

<p>Slayer. Who was he? What was he? Shadowspawn at the
Waygate, ravens in the Mountains of Mist, and this man called
Slayer in the Two Rivers. It could not be coincidence, however much
he wished it.</p>
