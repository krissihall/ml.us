Stepper&rsquo;s bridle, Verin led him to the
Winespring Inn herself, the crowd melting back to let her through,
then falling in after. Dannil and Ban and the others trailed along
on horse and afoot, kin mingling with them now. Astounded as they
were by the changes in Emond&rsquo;s Field, the lads still showed their
pride by striding even if they limped, or sitting up straighter in
the saddle; they had faced Trollocs and come home. But women ran
their hands over sons and nephews and grandsons, often biting back
tears, and their low moans made a soft, pained murmur. Tight-eyed
men tried to hide their worries behind proud smiles, clapping
shoulders and exclaiming over newly begun beards, yet frequently
their hugs just happened to turn into a shoulder to lean on.
Sweethearts rushed in with kisses and loud cries, equal parts
happiness and commiseration, and little brothers and sisters,
uncertain, alternated between fits of weeping and clinging in
wide-eyed wonder to a brother everyone seemed to be taking for a
hero.</p>

<p>It was the other voices Perrin wished he could not
hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Kenley?&rdquo; Mistress Ahan was a handsome
woman, with streaks of white in her nearly black braid, but she
wore a fear-filled frown as she scanned faces and saw eyes flinch
from hers. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my Kenley?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bili!&rdquo; old Hu al&rsquo;Dai called uncertainly. &ldquo;Has anyone
seen Bili al&rsquo;Dai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Hu&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Jared&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Tim&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Colly&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In front of the inn, Perrin fell out of the saddle in
his need to escape those names, not even seeing whose hands caught
him. &ldquo;Get me inside!&rdquo; he grated. &ldquo;Inside!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Teven&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Haral&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Had&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door cut off the heart-lost wails, and the cries
of Dael al&rsquo;Taron&rsquo;s mother for someone to tell her where her son
was.</p>

<p><em>In a Trolloc cookpot</em>, Perrin thought as he
was lowered into a chair in the common room. <em>In a Trolloc&rsquo;s
belly, where I put him, Mistress al&rsquo;Taron. Where I put him</em>.
Faile had his head in her hands, peering into his face worriedly.
<em>Care for the living</em>, he thought. <em>I&rsquo;ll weep for the
dead later. Later</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am all right,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;I just got a little
light-headed dismounting. I&rsquo;ve never been a good rider.&rdquo; She did
not seem to believe him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you do something?&rdquo; she demanded of Verin.</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai calmly shook her head. &ldquo;I think better
not, child. A pity neither of us is Yellow, but Alanna is still a
much better Healer than I. My Talents lie in other directions.
Ihvon will bring her. Wait with patience, child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The common room had been turned into an armory of
sorts. Except in front of the fireplace, the walls were a solid
mass of propped spears of every description, with the occasional
halberd or bill mixed in, and some polearms with oddly shaped
blades, many pitted and discolored where old rust had been scoured
away. Even more surprisingly, a barrel near the foot of the stairs
held swords all jumbled together, most without scabbards and no two
alike. Every attic within five miles must have been turned out for
relics dust-covered for generations. Perrin would not have
suspected there were five swords in the whole Two Rivers. Before
the Whitecloaks and Trollocs came, anyway.</p>

<p>Gaul took a place off to one side, near the stairs
that led up to the inn&rsquo;s rooms and the al&rsquo;Veres&rsquo; living quarters,
watching Perrin but plainly aware of Verin and every move she made.
On the other side of the room, watching Faile and all else, the two
Maidens cradled their spears in the crook of an elbow and took a
hipshot stance that seemed at once casual and yet balanced on the
toes. The three young fellows who had carried Perrin in shifted
their feet by the door, staring at him and the Aes Sedai and the
Aiel with equally wide eyes. That was all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The others,&rdquo; Perrin said. &ldquo;They need&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will be taken care of,&rdquo; Verin interrupted
smoothly, seating herself at another table. &ldquo;They will want to be
with their families. Much better to have loved ones close.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin felt a stab of pain&mdash;the graves below
the apple trees flashed in his mind&mdash;but he pushed it down.
<em>Take care of the living</em>, he reminded himself harshly. The
Aes Sedai brought out her pen and ink and began making notes in
that small book in a precise hand. He wondered whether she cared
how many Two Rivers folk died, so long as he lived, to be used in
the White Tower&rsquo;s plans for Rand.</p>

<p>Faile squeezed his hand, but it was to the Aes Sedai
that she spoke. &ldquo;Should we not take him up to a bed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; Perrin told her irritably. Verin looked up
and opened her mouth, and he repeated in a firmer voice, &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;
The Aes Sedai shrugged and went back to her note-taking. &ldquo;Does
anyone know where Loial is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Ogier?&rdquo; one of the three by the door said. Dav
Ayellin was stockier than Mat, but he had that same twinkle in his
dark eyes. He had the same rumpled, uncombed look about him as Mat,
too. In the old days, what little mischief Mat did not get up to,
Dav did, though Mat usually led the way. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s out with the men
clearing back the Westwood. You&rsquo;d think we were cutting down his
brother every time we cut a tree, but he clears three to anybody
else&rsquo;s one with that monstrous axe he had Master Luhhan make. If
you want him, I saw Jaim Thane running to tell them you had come
in. I&rsquo;ll bet they all come to get a look at you.&rdquo; Peering at the
broken-off arrow, he winced and rubbed his own side in sympathy.
&ldquo;Does it hurt much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It hurts enough,&rdquo; Perrin said curtly. Coming to get
a look at him. <em>What am I, a gleeman?</em> &ldquo;What about Luc? I
don&rsquo;t want to see him, but is he here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not.&rdquo; The second man, Elam Dowtry, rubbed
his long nose. Incongruous with his farmer&rsquo;s wool coat and his
cowlick, he wore a sword at his belt; the hilt had been freshly
wrapped in rawhide and the leather scabbard flaked and peeling.
&ldquo;Lord Luc is off hunting the Horn of Valere, I think. Or maybe
Trollocs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dav and Elam were Perrin&rsquo;s friends, or had been,
companions in hunting and fishing, both his age near enough, but
their thrilled grins made them seem younger. Either Mat or Rand
could have passed for five years older at least. Maybe he could,
too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope he comes back soon,&rdquo; Elam went on. &ldquo;He has
been showing me how to use a sword. Did you know he&rsquo;s a Hunter for
the Horn? And a king, if he had his rights. Of Andor, I hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Andor has queens,&rdquo; Perrin muttered absently, meeting
Faile&rsquo;s gaze, &ldquo;not kings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So he is not here,&rdquo; she said. Gaul shifted slightly;
he looked ready to go hunting for Luc, his eyes blue ice. It would
not have surprised Perrin to see Bain and Chiad veil themselves on
the spot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Verin said vaguely, manifestly more intent on
her notes than what she was saying. &ldquo;Not that he hasn&rsquo;t been a help
sometimes, but he does have a way of causing trouble when he is
here. Yesterday, before anyone knew what he was doing, he led a
delegation out to meet a Whitecloak patrol and told them Emond&rsquo;s
Field was closed to them. He apparently told them not to come
within ten miles. I cannot approve of Whitecloaks, but I do not
suppose they took that very well. Not wise to antagonize them more
than is strictly necessary.&rdquo; Frowning at what she had written, she
rubbed her nose, seemingly unaware of leaving a smudge of ink.</p>

<p>Perrin did not much care how the Whitecloaks took
anything. &ldquo;Yesterday,&rdquo; he breathed. If Luc had come back to the
village yesterday, it was not likely he could have had anything to
do with Trollocs being where they were not expected. The more
Perrin thought about how that ambush turned around, the more he
thought the Trollocs must have been expecting them. And the more he
wanted to blame Luc. &ldquo;Wanting won&rsquo;t make a stone cheese,&rdquo; he
muttered. &ldquo;But he still smells like cheese to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dav and the other two looked at each other
doubtfully. Perrin supposed he must not seem to be making much
sense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a bunch of Coplins, mainly,&rdquo; the third fellow
said in a startlingly deep voice. &ldquo;Darl and Hari and Dag and Ewal.
And Wit Congar. Daise gave him a fit over it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard they all liked the Whitecloaks.&rdquo; Perrin
thought the bass-voiced fellow seemed familiar. He was younger than
Elam and Dav by two or three years yet an inch taller, lean-faced
but with wide shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They did.&rdquo; The fellow laughed. &ldquo;You know them. They
drift naturally toward anything that makes trouble for somebody
else. Since Lord Luc has been talking, they&rsquo;re all for marching up
to Watch Hill and telling the Whitecloaks to get out of the Two
Rivers. Anyway, they&rsquo;re for somebody else marching up there. I
think they mean to be well back in the pack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If that face had been pudgy, and half a foot or more
nearer the ground&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;Ewin Finngar!&rdquo; Perrin exclaimed. It could
not be; Ewin was a stout, squeaky little nuisance who tried to
crowd in whenever the older fellows got together. This lad would be
as big as he was, or bigger, by the time he stopped growing. &ldquo;Is
that you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ewin nodded with a broad grin. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been hearing
all about you, Perrin,&rdquo; he said in that surprising bass, &ldquo;fighting
Trollocs, and having all kinds of adventures out in the world, so
they say. I can still call you Perrin, can&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light, yes!&rdquo; Perrin barked. He was more than tired
of this Goldeneyes business.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d gone with you last year.&rdquo; Dav rubbed his
hands together eagerly. &ldquo;Coming home with Aes Sedai, and Warders,
and an Ogier.&rdquo; He made them sound like trophies. &ldquo;All I ever do is
herd cows and milk cows, herd cows and milk cows. That and hoe, and
chop wood. You&rsquo;ve had all the luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it like?&rdquo; Elam put in breathlessly. &ldquo;Alanna
Sedai said you&rsquo;ve been all the way to the Great Blight, and I hear
you&rsquo;ve seen Caemlyn, and Tear. What&rsquo;s a city like? Are they really
ten times as big as Emond&rsquo;s Field? Did you see a palace? Are there
Darkfriends in the cities? Is the Blight really full of Trollocs
and Fades and Warders?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did a Trolloc give you that scar?&rdquo; Voice like a bull
or not, Ewin managed a sort of squeaky excitement. &ldquo;I wish I had a
scar. Did you see a queen? Or a king? I think I&rsquo;d rather see a
queen, but a king would be grand. What is the White Tower like? Is
it as big as a palace?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faile smiled, amused, but Perrin blinked at the
onslaught. Had they forgotten the Trollocs on Winternight,
forgotten the Trollocs in the countryside right then? Elam clutched
his sword hilt as if he wanted to be off for the Blight on the
instant, and Dav was up on his toes, eyes gleaming, and Ewin looked
ready to grab Perrin&rsquo;s collar. Adventure? They were idiots. Yet
there were hard times coming, harder than the Two Rivers had seen
so far, he was afraid. It could not hurt if they had a little while
longer before they learned the truth.</p>

<p>His side hurt, but he tried to answer. They seemed
disappointed he had never seen the White Tower, or a king or a
queen. He thought Berelain might suffice for a queen, but with
Faile there he was not about to mention her. Some other things he
shied away from; Falme, and the Eye of the World, the Forsaken,
<em>Callandor</em>. Dangerous subjects, those, leading inevitably
to the Dragon Reborn. He could tell them a little of Caemlyn,
though, and Tear, of the Borderlands and the Blight. It was odd
what they accepted and what not. The corrupted landscape of the
Blight, seeming to rot while you looked at it, they ate up, and
top-knotted Shienaran soldiers, and Ogier <em>stedding</em> where
Aes Sedai could not wield the Power and Fades were reluctant to
enter. But the size of the Stone of Tear, or the immensity of
cities&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>About his own supposed adventures, he said &ldquo;Mainly
I&rsquo;ve just tried to keep from having my head split open. That&rsquo;s what
adventures are, that and finding a place to sleep for the night,
and something to eat. You go hungry a lot having adventures, and
sleep cold or wet or both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They did not like that very much, or appear to
believe it any more than they believed that the Stone was as big as
a small mountain. He reminded himself that he had known as little
of the world before he left the Two Rivers. It did not help much.
He had never been this wide-eyed. Had he? The common room seemed to
be hot. He would have taken his coat off, but moving seemed too
much effort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about Rand and Mat?&rdquo; Ewin demanded. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s
all being hungry and getting rained on, why didn&rsquo;t they come home,
too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tam and Abell had come in, Tam with a sword belted on
over his coat and both men with bows&mdash;oddly, the sword looked
right on Tam, farm coat or no&mdash;so he told it much as he had
before, Mat gambling and carousing in taverns and chasing girls,
and Rand in his fine coat with a pretty, yellow-haired girl on his
arm. He made Elayne a lady, expecting they would never believe the
Daughter-Heir of Andor, and was proved right when they expressed
incredulity. Still, it all seemed satisfactory, the kind of thing
they wanted to hear, and disbelief faded a bit when Elam pointed
out that Faile was a lady and seemed to be dancing attendance on
Perrin pretty sharp. That made Perrin grin; he wondered what they
would say if he told them she was cousin to a queen.</p>

<p>Faile no longer appeared to be amused for some
reason. She turned on them with a stare to match Elayne&rsquo;s
haughtiest, stiff-backed and frosty-faced. &ldquo;You have badgered him
enough. He is wounded. Off with you, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a wonder, they bowed clumsily&mdash;Dav made an
awkward leg, looking a complete fool&mdash;and murmured hasty
apologies&mdash;to her, not him!&mdash;and turned to go. Their
departure was delayed by the arrival of Loial, stooping through the
doorway with his shaggy hair brushing the transom. They stared at
the Ogier almost as if seeing him for the first time&mdash;then
glanced at Faile and hurried on their way. That cold, lady&rsquo;s stare
of hers did work.</p>

<p>When Loial straightened, his head came just short of
the ceiling. His capacious coat pockets bore the usual squared
bulges of books, but he carried a huge axe. Its haft stood as tall
as he did, and its head, shaped like a wood-axe, was at least as
big as Perrin&rsquo;s battle-axe. &ldquo;You are hurt,&rdquo; he boomed as soon as
his eyes fell on Perrin. &ldquo;They told me you had returned, but they
did not say you were hurt, or I would have come faster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The axe gave Perrin a start. Among Ogier, &ldquo;putting a
long handle on your axe&rdquo; meant being hasty, or angry&mdash;Ogier
seemed to see the two as much the same thing for some reason. Loial
did look angry, tufted ears drawing back, frowning so his dangling
eyebrows hung down on his broad cheeks. At having to cut trees, no
doubt. Perrin wanted to get him alone and find out if he had seen
anything more concerning Alanna&rsquo;s doings. Or Verin&rsquo;s. He rubbed his
face and was surprised to find it dry; he felt as if he should be
sweating.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is also stubborn,&rdquo; Faile said, turning on Perrin
with the same commanding look she had used on Dav and Elam and
Ewin. &ldquo;You should be in a bed. Where is Alanna, Verin? If she is to
Heal him, where is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She will come.&rdquo; The Aes Sedai did not look up. She
was back into her little book again, frowning thoughtfully, pen
poised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He should still be in a bed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will have time for that later,&rdquo; Perrin said
firmly. He smiled at her to soften it, but all that did was make
her look worried and mutter &ldquo;stubborn&rdquo; under her breath. He could
not ask Loial about the Aes Sedai in front of Verin, but there was
something else at least as important. &ldquo;Loial, the Waygate is
unlocked, and Trollocs coming through. How can that be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Ogier&rsquo;s brows sank even deeper, and his ears
wilted. &ldquo;My fault, Perrin,&rdquo; he rumbled mournfully. &ldquo;I put both <em>
Avendesora</em> leaves on the outside. That locked the Waygate on
the inside, but from the outside, anyone could still open it. The
Ways have been dark for long generations, yet we grew them. I could
not bring myself to destroy the Gate. I am sorry, Perrin. It is all
my fault.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not believe a Waygate <em>could</em> be
destroyed,&rdquo; Faile said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not mean destroy, exactly.&rdquo; Loial leaned on
his long-handled axe. &ldquo;A Waygate was destroyed once, less than five
hundred years after the Breaking, according to Damelle, daughter of
Ala daughter of Soferra, because the Gate was near a <em>
stedding</em> that had fallen to the Blight. There are two or three
Gates lost in the Blight as it is. But she wrote that it was very
difficult, and required thirteen Aes Sedai working together with a
<em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>. Another attempt she wrote of, by only nine,
during the Trolloc Wars, damaged the Gate in such a way that the
Aes Sedai were pulled into&mdash;&rdquo; He cut off, ears wriggling with
embarrassment, and knuckled his wide nose. Everyone was staring at
him, even Verin and the Aiel. &ldquo;I do let myself be carried away,
sometimes. The Waygate. Yes. I cannot destroy it, but if I remove
both <em>Avendesora</em> leaves completely, they will die.&rdquo; He
grimaced at the thought. &ldquo;The only means of opening the Gate again
will be for the Elders to bring the Talisman of Growing. Though I
suppose an Aes Sedai could cut a hole in it.&rdquo; This time he
shuddered. Damaging a Waygate must have seemed like tearing up a
book to him. A moment later, he was grim-faced once more. &ldquo;I will
go now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Perrin said sharply. The arrowhead seemed to
throb, but it did not really hurt anymore. He was talking too much;
his throat was dry. &ldquo;There are Trollocs up there, Loial. They can
fit an Ogier into a cookpot as well as a human.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Perrin, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Loial. How are you going to write your book if
you go off and get yourself killed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial&rsquo;s ears twitched. &ldquo;It is my responsibility,
Perrin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The responsibility is mine,&rdquo; Perrin said gently.
&ldquo;You told me what you were doing with the Waygate, and I didn&rsquo;t
suggest anything different. Besides, the way you jump every time
your mother is mentioned, I don&rsquo;t want her coming after me. I will
go, as soon as Alanna Heals this arrow out of me.&rdquo; He wiped his
forehead, then frowned at his hand. Still no sweat. &ldquo;Can I have a
drink of water?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faile was there in an instant, her cool fingers where
his hand had been. &ldquo;He is burning up! Verin, we cannot wait for
Alanna. You must&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am here,&rdquo; the dark Aes Sedai announced, appearing
from the door at the back of the common room, Marin al&rsquo;Vere and
Alsbet Luhhan at her heels, and Ihvon right behind them. Perrin
felt the tingle of the Power before Alanna&rsquo;s hand replaced Faile&rsquo;s,
and she added in a cool, serene voice, &ldquo;Carry him into the kitchen.
The table there is large enough to lay him out. Quickly. There is
not much time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin&rsquo;s head spun, and abruptly he realized Loial
had leaned his axe beside the door and picked him up, cradling him
in his arms. &ldquo;The Waygate is mine, Loial.&rdquo; <em>Light, I&rsquo;m
thirsty</em>. &ldquo;My responsibility.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The arrowhead truly did not seem to hurt as much as
it had, but he ached all over. Loial was carrying him somewhere,
bending through doorways. There was Mistress Luhhan, biting her
lip, eyes squinched as if about to cry. He wondered why. She never
cried. Mistress al&rsquo;Vere looked worried, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mistress Luhhan,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;Mother says I can
come be apprenticed to Master Luhhan.&rdquo; No. That was a long time
ago. That was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;What was? He could not seem to remember.</p>

<p>He was lying on something hard, listening to Alanna
speak. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;barbs are caught on bone as well as flesh, and the
arrowhead has twisted. I must realign it with the first wound and
pull it out. If the shock does not kill him, I can then Heal the
damage I have done as well as the rest. There is no other way. He
is near the brink now.&rdquo; Nothing to do with him.</p>

<p>Faile smiled down at him tremulously, her face upside
down. Had he really once thought her mouth was too wide? It was
just right. He wanted to touch her cheek, but Mistress al&rsquo;Vere and
Mistress Luhhan were holding his wrists for some reason, leaning
with all their weight. Someone was lying across his legs, too, and
Loial&rsquo;s big hands swallowed his shoulders, pressing them flat to
the table. Table. Yes. The kitchen table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bite down, my heart,&rdquo; Faile said from far away. &ldquo;It
will hurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He wanted to ask her what would hurt, but she was
pressing a leather-wrapped stick into his mouth. He smelled the
leather and the spicewood and her. Would she come hunting with him,
running across the endless grassy plains after endless herds of
deer? Icy cold shivered through him; vaguely he recognized the feel
of the One Power. And then there was pain. He heard the stick snap
between his teeth before blackness covered everything.</p>
