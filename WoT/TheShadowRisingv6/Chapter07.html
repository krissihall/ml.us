<h4><em>Playing With Fire</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">W</span>ith
the sun barely above the horizon the next
morning, Egwene presented herself at the doors to Rand&rsquo;s chambers,
followed by a foot-dragging Elayne. The Daughter-Heir wore a
long-sleeved dress of pale blue silk, cut in the Tairen fashion,
and pulled low after some little discussion. A necklace of
sapphires like a deep morning sky, and another strand woven into
her red-gold curls, showed up the blue of her eyes. Despite the
damp warmth, Egwene wore a plain, deep red scarf, as large as a
shawl, around her shoulders. Aviendha had supplied the scarf, and
the sapphires too. Surprisingly, the Aiel woman had a tidy store of
such things somehow.</p>

<p>For all she had known they were there, Egwene gave a
start when the Aiel guards glided to their feet with startling
suddenness. Elayne let out a small gasp, but quickly eyed them with
that regal bearing she managed so well. It seemed to have no effect
on these sun-dark men. The six were <em>Shae&rsquo;en M&rsquo;taal</em>, Stone
Dogs, and appeared relaxed for Aiel, meaning they seemed to be
looking everywhere, seemed ready to move in any direction.</p>

<p>Egwene drew herself up in imitation of Elayne&mdash;she did wish she could do that as well as the Daughter-Heir&mdash;and announced, &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;we&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;want to see how the Lord Dragon&rsquo;s
wounds are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her remark was plainly foolish, if they knew much
about Healing, but that likelihood was small; few people did, and
Aiel probably less than most. She had not intended to give any
reason for being there&mdash;it was enough that they thought her
Aes Sedai&mdash;but when the Aiel appeared almost to spring out of
the black marble floor, it suddenly seemed a good idea. Not that
they were making any move to stop Elayne and her, of course. But
these men were all so tall, so stone-faced, and they carried those
short spears and horn bows as if using them would be as natural as
breathing, and as easy. With those light-colored eyes regarding her
so intently, it was all too easy to remember stories of
black-veiled Aiel, without mercy or pity, of the Aiel War and the
men like these who had destroyed every army sent against them until
the last, who had only turned back to the Waste after fighting the
allied nations to a standstill during three blood-soaked days and
nights before Tar Valon itself. She very nearly embraced
<em>saidar</em>.</p>

<p>Gaul, the Stone Dogs&rsquo; leader, nodded, looking down at
Elayne and her with a touch of respect. He was a handsome man, in a
rugged way, a little older than Nynaeve, with eyes as green and
clear as polished gems and long eyelashes so dark they seemed to
outline his eyes in black. &ldquo;They may be troubling him. He is in a
foul mood this morning.&rdquo; Gaul grinned, just a quick flash of white
teeth, in understanding of a temper when wounded. &ldquo;He has chased
off a group of these High Lords already, and threw one of them out
himself. What was his name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Torean,&rdquo; another, even taller man replied. He had an
arrow nocked, the short, curved bow held almost casually. His gray
eyes rested on the two women for an instant, then went back to
searching among the anteroom&rsquo;s columns.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Torean,&rdquo; Gaul agreed. &ldquo;I thought he would slide as
far as those pretty carvings&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He pointed a spear to the ring
of stiff-standing Defenders. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but he came short by three
paces. I lost a good Tairen hanging, all hawks in gold thread, to
Mangin.&rdquo; The taller man gave a brief, contented smile.</p>

<p>Egwene blinked at the image of Rand physically
pitching a High Lord across the floor. He had never been violent;
far from it. How much had he changed? She had been too busy with
Joiya and Amico, and he too busy with Moiraine or Lan or the High
Lords, to do more than speak in passing, a few words about home
here and there, about how the Bel Tine festival might have gone
this year and what Sunday would be like. It had all been so brief.
How much had he changed?</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have to see him,&rdquo; Elayne said, a slight tremor in
her voice.</p>

<p>Gaul made a bow, grounding the point of one spear on
the black marble. &ldquo;Of course, Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was with some trepidation that Egwene entered
Rand&rsquo;s chambers, and Elayne&rsquo;s face spoke volumes of the effort
those few steps took.</p>

<p>No evidence of last night&rsquo;s horror remained, unless
it was the absence of mirrors; lighter patches marked the wall
panels where those hanging there had been taken away. Not that the
room came anywhere near neatness; books lay everywhere, on
everything, some lying open as if abandoned in the middle of a
page, and the bed was still unmade. The crimson draperies were
pulled open on all the windows, facing westward toward the river
that was Tear&rsquo;s heartvein, and <em>Callandor</em> sparkled like
polished crystal on a huge gilded stand of surpassing gaudiness.
Egwene thought the stand the ugliest thing she had ever seen
decorating a room&mdash;until she glimpsed the silver wolves
savaging a golden stag on the mantel above the fireplace. Scant
breezes off the river kept the room surprisingly cool compared to
the rest of the Stone.</p>

<p>Rand sat in his shirtsleeves, sprawled in a chair
with one leg over the arm and a leather-bound book propped against
his knee. At the sound of their footsteps, he snapped the book shut
and dropped it among the others on the scroll-worked carpet,
bounding to his feet ready to fight. The scowl on his face faded as
he took in who they were.</p>

<p>For the first time in the Stone, Egwene looked for
changes in him and found them. How many months before then since
she had seen him last? Enough for his face to have grown harder,
for the openness that had once been there to fade. He moved
differently, too, a little like Lan, a little like the Aiel. With
his height and his reddish hair, and eyes that seemed now blue, now
gray, as the light took them, he looked all too much like an
Aielman, too much for comfort. But had he changed inside?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you were&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;someone else,&rdquo; he mumbled,
sharing out embarrassed glances between them. That was the Rand she
knew, even to the flush that rose in his cheeks every time he
looked at her or Elayne, either one. &ldquo;Some&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;people want things
I can&rsquo;t give. Things I <em>will</em> not give.&rdquo; Suspicion grew on
his face with shocking suddenness, and his tone hardened. &ldquo;What do
<em>you</em> want? Did Moiraine send you? Are you supposed to
convince me to do what she wants?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a goose,&rdquo; Egwene said sharply before she
thought. &ldquo;I do not want you to start a war!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne added in pleading tones, &ldquo;We came to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to
help you, if we can.&rdquo; That was one of their reasons, and the
easiest to bring up, they had decided over breakfast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know about her plans for&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; he began
roughly, then made a sudden shift. &ldquo;Help me? How? That is what
Moiraine says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene sternly folded her arms beneath her breasts,
holding the scarf tight, in the way Nynaeve used to address the
Village Council when she meant to have her way no matter how
stubborn they were. It was too late to start over; the only thing
was to go on as she had begun. &ldquo;I told you not to be a fool, Rand
al&rsquo;Thor. You may have Tairens bowing to your boots, but I remember
when Nynaeve switched your bottom for letting Mat talk you into
stealing a jar of apple brandy.&rdquo; Elayne kept her face carefully
composed. Too carefully; it was plain to Egwene that she wanted to
laugh out loud.</p>

<p>Rand did not notice, of course. Men never did. He
grinned at Egwene, close to laughing himself. &ldquo;We had just turned
thirteen. She found us asleep behind your father&rsquo;s stable, and our
heads hurt so much we didn&rsquo;t even feel her switch.&rdquo; That was not at
all the way Egwene recalled it. &ldquo;Not like when you threw that bowl
at her head. Remember? She&rsquo;d dosed you with dogweed tea because
you had been moping about for a week, and as soon as you tasted it,
you hit her with her best bowl. Light, did you squeal! When was
that? Two years ago come this&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are not here to talk over old times,&rdquo; Egwene
said, shifting the scarf irritably. It was thin wool, but still far
too hot. Really, he did have the habit of remembering the most
unfortunate things.</p>

<p>He grinned as if he knew what she was thinking, and
went on in better humor. &ldquo;You are here to help me, you say. With
what? I don&rsquo;t suppose you know how to make a High Lord keep his
word when I&rsquo;m not staring over his shoulder. Or how to stop
unwanted dreams? I could surely use help with&mdash;&rdquo; Eyes darting
to Elayne and back to her, he made another abrupt shift. &ldquo;What
about the Old Tongue? Did you learn any of that in the White
Tower?&rdquo; Without waiting for an answer he began rooting through the
volumes scattered across the carpet. There were more on the chairs,
among the tumbled bedclothes. &ldquo;I have a copy here&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;somewhere&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand.&rdquo; Egwene raised her voice. &ldquo;Rand, I cannot read
the Old Tongue.&rdquo; She shot a look at Elayne, warning her not to
admit to any such knowledge. They had not come to translate the
Prophecies of the Dragon for him. The sapphires in the
Daughter-Heir&rsquo;s hair swayed as she nodded agreement. &ldquo;We had other
things to learn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He straightened from the books with a sigh. &ldquo;It was
too much to hope.&rdquo; For a moment he seemed on the point of saying
more, but stared at his boots. Egwene wondered how he managed to
deal with the High Lords in all their arrogance if she and Elayne
put him so out of countenance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We came to help you with channeling,&rdquo; she told him.
&ldquo;With the Power.&rdquo; What Moiraine claimed was supposed to be true; a
woman could not teach a man to channel any more than she could
teach him how to bear a child. Egwene was not so sure. She had felt
something woven from <em>saidin</em>, once. Or rather, she had felt
nothing, something blocking her own flows as surely as stone dammed
water. But she had learned as much outside the Tower as within;
surely in her knowledge there was something she could teach him,
some guidance she could offer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we can,&rdquo; Elayne added.</p>

<p>Suspicion flashed across his face again. It was
unnerving how his mood changed so quickly. &ldquo;I have more chance of
reading the Old Tongue than you do of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Are you sure this
isn&rsquo;t Moiraine&rsquo;s doing? Did she send you here? Thinks she can
convince me by some roundabout way, does she? Some twisty Aes Sedai
plot I&rsquo;ll not see the point of until I am mired in it?&rdquo; He grunted
sourly and pulled a dark green coat from the floor behind one of
the chairs, shrugging into it hastily. &ldquo;I agreed to meet some more
of the High Lords this morning. If I don&rsquo;t keep an eye on them,
they just find ways to get around what I want. They&rsquo;ll learn sooner
or later. I rule Tear, now. Me. The Dragon Reborn. I will teach
them. You will have to excuse me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene wanted to shake him. He ruled Tear? Well,
perhaps he did, if it came to that, but she remembered a boy with a
lamb nestled inside his coat, proud as a rooster because he had
driven off the wolf that tried to take it. He was a shepherd, not a
king, and even if he had call to give himself airs, it was no good
to him that he did.</p>

<p>She was about to tell him as much, but before she
could Elayne spoke up fiercely. &ldquo;No one sent us. No one. We came
because&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;because we care for you. Perhaps it will not work,
but you can try. If I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;if we care enough to try, you can try,
too. Is it so unimportant to you that you cannot spare us an hour?
For your life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped buttoning up his coat, staring at the
Daughter-Heir so intently that for a moment Egwene thought he had
forgotten she was there. With a shiver he pulled his eyes away.
Glancing at Egwene, he shifted his feet and frowned at the floor.
&ldquo;I will try,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll do no good, but I will&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;What do you want me to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene drew a deep breath. She had not thought
convincing him would be this easy; he had always been like a
boulder buried in mud when he decided to dig his heels in, which he
did far too often.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at me,&rdquo; she said, embracing <em>saidar</em>.
She let the Power fill her as completely as it ever had, more
completely, accepting every drop she could hold; it was as if light
suffused every particle of her, as if the Light itself filled every
cranny. Life seemed to burst inside her like fireworks. She had
never before let this much in. It was a shock to realize she was
not quivering; surely she could not bear this glorious sweetness.
She wanted to revel in it, to dance and sing, to simply lie back
and let it roll through her, over her. She made herself speak.
&ldquo;What do you see? What do you feel? Look at me, Rand!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He lifted his head slowly, still frowning. &ldquo;I see
you. What am I supposed to see? Are you touching the Source?
Egwene, Moiraine has channeled around me a hundred times, and I
never saw anything. Except what she did. It doesn&rsquo;t work that way.
Even I know that much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am stronger than Moiraine,&rdquo; she told him firmly.
&ldquo;She would be whimpering on the floor, or insensible, if she tried
to hold as much as I hold now.&rdquo; It was true, though she had never
before rated the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s ability so closely.</p>

<p>It cried out to be used, this Power pulsing through
her stronger than heartblood. With this much, she could do things
Moiraine could not dream of doing. The wound in Rand&rsquo;s side that
Moiraine could never Heal completely. She did not know Healing&mdash;it was considerably more complex than anything she had ever
done&mdash;but she had watched Nynaeve Heal, and perhaps, with
this great pool of the Power filling her, she could see something
of how that could be Healed. Not to do it, of course; only to
see.</p>

<p>Carefully she spun out hair-fine flows of Air and
Water and Spirit, the Powers used for Healing, and felt for his old
injury. One touch, and she recoiled, shivering, snatching back her
weaving; her stomach churned as if every meal she had ever eaten
wanted to come up. It seemed that all the darkness in the world
rested there in Rand&rsquo;s side, all the world&rsquo;s evil in a festering
sore only lightly covered by tender scar tissue. A thing like that
would soak up Healing flows like drops of water on dry sand. How
could he bear the pain? Why was he not weeping?</p>

<p>From first thought to action had taken only a moment.
Shaken, and desperately hiding it, she went on without a pause.
&ldquo;You are as strong as I. I know it; you must be. Feel, Rand. What
do you feel?&rdquo; <em>Light, what can Heal that? Can anything?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel anything,&rdquo; he muttered, shifting his
feet. &ldquo;Goose bumps. And no wonder. It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t trust you,
Egwene, but I cannot help being nervous when a woman is channeling
around me. I am sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not bother explaining to him the difference
between channeling and merely embracing the True Source. There was
so much he did not know, even compared to her own scant knowledge.
He was a blind man trying to work a loom by touch, with no idea of
colors or what the threads, or even the loom, looked like.</p>

<p>With an effort she released <em>saidar</em>, and it
was an effort. Part of her wanted to cry at the loss. &ldquo;I am not
touching the Source now, Rand.&rdquo; She stepped closer and peered up at
him. &ldquo;Do you still feel goose bumps?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. But that&rsquo;s just because you told me.&rdquo; He gave an
abrupt shrug of his shoulders. &ldquo;You see? I started thinking about
it, and I have them again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene smiled triumphantly. She did not need to look
around at Elayne to confirm what she had already sensed, what they
had agreed upon earlier for this point. &ldquo;You can sense a woman
embracing the Source, Rand. Elayne is doing just that right now.&rdquo;
He squinted at the Daughter-Heir. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter what you see
or don&rsquo;t see. You felt it. We have that much. Let&rsquo;s see what else
we can find. Rand, embrace the Source. Embrace <em>saidin</em>.&rdquo;
The words came out hoarsely. They had agreed on this, too, she and
Elayne. He was Rand, not a monster from the stories, and they had
agreed on it, but still, asking a man to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The wonder was that
she had gotten the words out at all. &ldquo;Do you see anything?&rdquo; she
asked Elayne. &ldquo;Or feel anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand still doled out glances between them, in between
staring at the floor and sometimes blushing. Why <em>was</em> he so
out of countenance? Studying him fixedly, the Daughter-Heir shook
her head. &ldquo;He could just be standing there for all I can tell. Are
you sure he is doing anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can be stubborn, but he isn&rsquo;t foolish. At least,
he isn&rsquo;t foolish most of the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, stubborn or foolish or something else, I feel
nothing at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene frowned at him. &ldquo;You said you would do as we
asked, Rand. Are you? If you felt something, so should I, and I do
not&mdash;&rdquo; She broke off with a stifled yelp. <em>Something</em>
had pinched her bottom. Rand&rsquo;s lips twitched, clearly fighting a
grin. &ldquo;That,&rdquo; she told him crisply, &ldquo;was not nice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He tried to keep his face innocent, but the grin
slipped. &ldquo;You said you wanted to feel something, and I just
thought&mdash;&rdquo; His sudden roar made Egwene jump. Clapping a hand to
his left buttock, he hobbled in a pained circle. &ldquo;Blood and ashes,
Egwene! There was no need to&mdash;&rdquo; He fell off into deeper,
inaudible mutters Egwene was just as glad she did not
understand.</p>

<p>She took the opportunity to flap the scarf for a
little air, and shared a small smile with Elayne. The glow faded
around the Daughter-Heir. They both came close to giggling as they
rubbed themselves surreptitiously. That should show him. About a
hundred for one, Egwene estimated.</p>

<p>Turning back to Rand, she put on her sternest face.
&ldquo;I would have expected something like that from Mat. I thought you,
at least, had grown up. We came here to help you, if we can. Try to
cooperate. Do something with the Power, something that isn&rsquo;t
childish. Perhaps we will be able to sense that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hunched, he glared at them. &ldquo;Do something,&rdquo; he
muttered. &ldquo;You had no call to&mdash;I&rsquo;ll limp for&mdash;You want
me to do something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly she lifted into the air, and Elayne, too;
they stared at each other, wide-eyed, as they floated a pace above
the carpet. There was nothing holding them, no flows Egwene could
feel or see. Nothing. Her mouth tightened. He had no right to do
this. No right at all, and it was time he learned it. The same sort
of shield of Spirit that cut Joiya off from the Source would stop
him, too; Aes Sedai used it on the rare men they found who could
channel.</p>

<p>She opened herself to <em>saidar</em>&mdash;and her
stomach sank. <em>Saidar</em> was there&mdash;she could feel its
warmth and light&mdash;but between her and the True Source stood
something, nothing, an absence that shut her away from the Source
like a stone wall. She felt hollow inside, until panic welled up to
fill her. A man was channeling, and she was caught in it. He was
Rand, of course, but dangling there like a basket, helpless, all
she could think of was a man channeling, and the taint on
<em>saidin</em>. She tried to shout at him, but all that came out
was a croak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want me to do something?&rdquo; Rand growled. A pair
of small tables flexed their legs awkwardly, the wood creaking, and
began to stumble about in a stiff parody of dance, gilt flaking off
and falling. &ldquo;Do you like this?&rdquo; Fire flared up in the fireplace,
filling the hearth from side to side, burning on stone bare of
ashes. &ldquo;Or this?&rdquo; The tall stag and wolves above the fireplace
began to soften and slump. Thin streams of gold and silver flowed
out from the mass, fining down to shining threads, snaking, weaving
themselves into a narrow sheet of metallic cloth; the length of
glittering fabric hung in the air as it grew, its far end still
linked to the slowly melting statuette on the stone mantel. &ldquo;Do
something,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;Do something! Do you have any idea what it
is like to touch <em>saidin</em>, to hold it? Do you? I can feel
the madness waiting. Seeping into me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly the capering tables burst into flame like
torches, dancing still; books spun into the air, pages fluttering;
the mattress on the bed erupted, showering feathers across the room
like snow. Feathers falling onto the burning tables filled the room
with their sharp, sooty stink.</p>

<p>For a moment Rand stared wildly at the blazing
tables. Then whatever was holding Egwene and Elayne vanished, along
with the shield; their heels thumped onto the carpet in the same
instant the flames went out as if sucked into the wood they had
been consuming. The blaze in the fireplace winked out, as well, and
the books fell to the floor in a worse jumble than before. The
length of gold-and-silver cloth dropped, too, along with strands of
rough-melted metal, no longer liquid or even hot. Only three
largish lumps, two silver and one gold, remained on the mantel,
cold and unrecognizable.</p>

<p>Egwene had staggered into Elayne as they landed. They
clutched each other for support, but Egwene felt the other woman
doing exactly what she was doing, embracing <em>saidar</em> as
quickly as she could. In moments she had a shield ready to throw
around Rand if he even appeared to be channeling, but he stood
stunned, staring at the charred tables with feathers still drifting
down around him, flecking his coat.</p>

<p>He did not seem to be a danger, now, but the room was
certainly a mess. She wove tiny flows of Air to pull all the
floating feathers together, and those already on the carpet, as
well. As an afterthought, she added those on his coat. The rest of
it he could have the majhere straighten, or see to himself.</p>

<p>Rand flinched as the feathers floated past him to
alight on the tattered ruins of the mattress. It did nothing for
the smell, burned feathers and burned wood, but at least the room
was neater, and the open windows and faint breezes were already
lessening the stench.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The majhere may not want to give me another,&rdquo; he
said with a strained laugh. &ldquo;A mattress a day is probably more than
she is willing to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He avoided looking at her or Elayne. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sorry. I did not mean to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Sometimes it runs wild. Sometimes
there&rsquo;s nothing there when I reach for it, and sometimes it does
things I don&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry. Perhaps you had better go. I seem
to say that a lot.&rdquo; He blushed again and cleared his throat. &ldquo;I am
not touching the Source, but maybe you had best go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are not done yet,&rdquo; Egwene said gently. More
gently than she felt&mdash;she wanted to box his ears; the idea of
picking her up like that, shielding her&mdash;and Elayne&mdash;but he was on the ragged edge. Of what, she did not know, and she
did not want to find out, not now, not here. With so many
exclaiming over their strength&mdash;everyone said she and Elayne
would be among the strongest Aes Sedai, if not the strongest, in a
thousand years or more&mdash;she had assumed they were as strong
as he. Near to it, at least. She had just been rudely disabused.
Perhaps Nynaeve could come close, if she was angry enough, but
Egwene knew she herself could never have done what he just had,
split her flows that many ways, worked that many things at once.
Working two flows at once was far more than twice as hard as
working one of the same magnitude, and working three much more than
twice again working two. He had to have been weaving a dozen. He
did not even look tired, yet exertion with the Power took energy.
She very much feared he could handle her and Elayne both like
kittens. Kittens he might decide to drown, if he went mad.</p>

<p>But she would not, could not, just walk away. That
would be the same as quitting, and she was not made that way. She
meant to do what she had come there for&mdash;all of it&mdash;and
he was not going to chase her off short of it. Not him or anything
else.</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s blue eyes were filled with determination,
and the moment Egwene fell silent she added in a much firmer voice,
&ldquo;And we will not go until we are. You said you would try. You must
try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did say that, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; he murmured after a time.
&ldquo;At least we can sit down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not looking at the blackened tables or the band of
metallic cloth lying crumpled on the carpet, he led them, limping
slightly, to high-backed chairs near the windows. They had to move
books from the red silk cushions in order to sit; Egwene&rsquo;s chair
held Volume Twelve of <em>The Treasures of the Stone of Tear</em>,
a dusty, wood-bound book entitled <em>Travels in the Aiel Waste,
with Various Observations on the Savage Inhabitants</em>, and a
thick, tattered leather volume called <em>Dealings with the
Territory of Mayene, 500 to 750 of the New Era</em>. Elayne had a
bigger stack to move, but Rand hurriedly took them from her along
with those from his chair and put them all on the floor, where the
pile promptly fell over. Egwene laid hers neatly beside them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want me to do now?&rdquo; He sat on the edge
of his seat, hands on his knees. &ldquo;I promise I won&rsquo;t do anything but
what you ask this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene bit her tongue to keep from telling him that
promise came a bit late. Perhaps she had been a little vague in
what she had asked for, but that was no excuse. Still, that was
something to be dealt with another time. She realized she was
thinking of him as just Rand again, but he looked as if he had just
splashed mud on her best dress and was worried she would not
believe it an accident. Yet she had not let go of <em>saidar</em>,
and neither had Elayne. There was no need to be foolish. &ldquo;This
time,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we just want you to talk. How do you embrace the
Source? Just tell us. Take it step by step, slowly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More like wrestling than embracing.&rdquo; He grunted.
&ldquo;Step by step? Well, first I imagine a flame, and then I push
everything into it. Hate, fear, nervousness. Everything. When
they&rsquo;re all consumed, there&rsquo;s an emptiness, a void, inside my head.
I am in the middle of it, but I&rsquo;m a part of whatever I am
concentrating on, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That sounds familiar,&rdquo; Egwene said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard your
father talk about a trick of concentration he uses to win the
archery competitions. What he calls the Flame and the Void.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand nodded; sadly, it seemed. She thought he must be
missing home, and his father. &ldquo;Tam taught it to me first. And Lan
uses it, too, with the sword. Selene&mdash;someone I met once&mdash;called it the Oneness. A good many people seem to know about
it, whatever they call it. But I found out for myself that when I
was inside the void, I could feel <em>saidin</em>, like a light
just beyond the corner of my eye in the emptiness. There&rsquo;s nothing
but me and that light. Emotion, even thought, is outside. I used to
have to take it bit by bit, but it all comes at once, now. Most of
it does, anyway. Most of the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emptiness,&rdquo; Elayne said with a shiver. &ldquo;No emotion.
That doesn&rsquo;t sound very much like what we do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it does,&rdquo; Egwene insisted eagerly. &ldquo;Rand, we
just do it a little differently, that&rsquo;s all. I imagine myself to be
a flower, a rosebud, imagine it until I <em>am</em> the rosebud.
That is like your void, in a way. The rosebud&rsquo;s petals open out to
the light of <em>saidar</em>, and I let it fill me, all light and
warmth and life and wonder. I surrender to it, and by surrendering,
I control it. That was the hardest part to learn, really; how to
master <em>saidar</em> by submitting, but it seems so natural now
that I do not even think about it. That is the key to it, Rand. I
am sure. You must learn to surrender&mdash;&rdquo; He was shaking his
head vigorously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing like what I do,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;Let
it fill me? I have to reach out and take hold of <em>saidin</em>.
Sometimes there&rsquo;s still nothing there when I do, nothing I can
touch, but if I didn&rsquo;t reach for it, I could stand there forever
and nothing would happen. It fills me all right, once I take hold,
but surrender to it?&rdquo; He raked his fingers through his hair.
&ldquo;Egwene, if I surrendered&mdash;even for a minute&mdash;<em>saidin</em> would consume me. It&rsquo;s like a river of molten
metal, an ocean of fire, all the light of the sun gathered in one
spot. I must fight it to make it do what I want, fight it to keep
from being eaten up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sighed. &ldquo;I know what you mean about life filling
you, though, even with the taint turning my stomach. Colors are
sharper, smells clearer. Everything is more real, somehow. I don&rsquo;t
want to let go, once I have it, even while it&rsquo;s trying to swallow
me. But the rest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Face the facts, Egwene. The Tower is right
about this. Accept it for the truth, because it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head. &ldquo;I will accept it when it is
proved to me.&rdquo; She did not sound as sure as she wanted to, not as
sure she had been. What he told sounded like some twisted
half-reflection of what she did, similarities only emphasizing
differences. Yet there were similarities. She would not give up.
&ldquo;Can you tell the flows apart? Air, Water, Spirit, Earth,
Fire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;Not usually. I just
take what I need to do what I want. Fumble for it, mostly. It&rsquo;s
very strange. Sometimes I need to do a thing, and I do it, but only
afterward do I know what it was I did, or how. It&rsquo;s almost like
remembering something I&rsquo;ve forgotten. But I can remember how to do
it again. Most of the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet you do remember how,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;How did you
set fire to those tables?&rdquo; She wanted to ask him how he had made
them dance&mdash;she thought she saw a way, with Air and Water&mdash;but she wanted to start with something simple; lighting a
candle and putting it out were things a novice could do.</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s face took on a pained expression. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know.&rdquo; He sounded embarrassed. &ldquo;When I want fire, for a lamp or a
fireplace, I just make it, but I do not know <em>how</em>. I don&rsquo;t
really need to think to do things with fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That almost stood to reason. Of the Five Powers, Fire
and Earth had been strongest in men in the Age of Legends, and Air
and Water in women; Spirit had been shared equally. Egwene hardly
had to think to use Air or Water, once she had learned to do a
thing in the first place. But the thought did not further their
purpose.</p>

<p>This time it was Elayne who pressed him. &ldquo;Do you know
how you extinguished them? You seemed to think before they went
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I do remember, because I don&rsquo;t believe I have
ever done it before. I took in the heat from the tables and spread
it into the stone of the fireplace; a fireplace wouldn&rsquo;t even
notice that much heat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne gasped, unconsciously cradling her left arm
for a moment, and Egwene winced in sympathy. She remembered when
that arm had been a mass of blisters because the Daughter-Heir had
done what Rand had just described, and with just the lamp in her
room. Sheriam had threatened to let the blisters heal by
themselves; she had not done it, but she had threatened. It was one
of the warnings novices were given; never draw heat in. A flame
could be extinguished using Air or Water, but using Fire to pull
the heat away meant disaster with a flame of any size. It was not a
matter of strength, so Sheriam had said; heat once taken in could
not be gotten rid of, not by the strongest woman ever to come out
of the White Tower. Women had actually burst into flame themselves
that way. Women had burst into flame. Egwene drew a ragged
breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Rand asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you just proved the difference to me.&rdquo; She
sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh. Does that mean you&rsquo;re ready to give up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; She tried to make her voice softer. She was not
angry with him. Exactly. She was not sure who she was angry with.
&ldquo;Maybe my teachers were right, but there has to be a way. Some way.
Only I cannot think of one, right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You tried,&rdquo; he said simply. &ldquo;I thank you for that.
It is not your fault it did not work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There must be a way,&rdquo; Egwene muttered, and Elayne
murmured, &ldquo;We will find it. We will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you will,&rdquo; he said with a forced
cheerfulness. &ldquo;But not today.&rdquo; He hesitated. &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll be
going, then.&rdquo; He sounded half-regretful, half-glad. &ldquo;I do need to
tell the High Lords a few things about taxes this morning. They
seem to think they can take as much from a farmer in a poor year as
a good without beggaring him. And I suppose you have to get back to
questioning those Darkfriends.&rdquo; He frowned.</p>

<p>He had not said anything, but Egwene was sure he
would like to keep them as far from the Black Ajah as possible. She
was a little surprised he had not already tried to make them return
to the Tower. Perhaps he knew that she and Nynaeve would put a flea
in his ear the size of a horse if he tried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do,&rdquo; she said firmly. &ldquo;But not right away. Rand&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; The time had come to bring up her second reason for being
there, but it was even more difficult than she had expected. This
was going to hurt him; those sad, wary eyes convinced her it would.
But it had to be done. She snugged the scarf around her; it
enveloped her from shoulders to waist. &ldquo;Rand, I cannot marry
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>She blinked. He was not taking it as hard as she
expected. She told herself that was good. &ldquo;I do not mean to hurt
you&mdash;really, I don&rsquo;t&mdash;but I do not want to marry
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand, Egwene. I know what I am. No woman
could&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wool-brained idiot!&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;This has
nothing to do with you channeling. I do not love you! At least, not
in the way to want to marry you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s jaw dropped. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;love me?&rdquo; He
sounded as surprised as he looked. And hurt, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please try to understand,&rdquo; she said in a gentler
voice. &ldquo;People change, Rand. Feelings change. When people are
apart, sometimes they grow apart. I love you as I would a brother,
perhaps more than a brother, but not to marry. Can you understand
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He managed a rueful grin. &ldquo;I really am a fool. I
didn&rsquo;t really believe you might change, too. Egwene, I do not want
to marry you, either. I did not want to change, I didn&rsquo;t try to,
but it happened. If you knew how much this means to me. Not having
to pretend. Not being afraid I&rsquo;ll hurt you. I never wanted to do
that, Egwene. Never to hurt you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She very nearly smiled. He was putting on such a
brave face; he was actually quite close to convincing. &ldquo;I am glad
you are taking it so well,&rdquo; she told him in a soft voice. &ldquo;I did
not want to hurt you, either. And now I really must go.&rdquo; Rising
from her chair, she bent to brush a kiss across his cheek. &ldquo;You
will find someone else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said, getting to his feet, the lie
loud in his voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She slipped out with a sense of satisfaction and
hurried across the anteroom, letting <em>saidar</em> go as she took
the scarf from her shoulders. The thing was abominably hot.</p>

<p>He was ready for Elayne to pick up like a lost puppy
if she handled him the way they had discussed. She thought Elayne
would manage him nicely, now and later. For as much later as they
had. Something had to be done about his control. She was willing to
admit that what she had been told was right&mdash;no woman could
teach him; fish and birds&mdash;but that was not the same as
giving up. Something had to be done, so a way had to be found. That
horrible wound and the madness were problems for later, but they
would be dealt with eventually. Somehow. Everyone said Two Rivers
men were stubborn, but they could not match Two Rivers women.</p>
