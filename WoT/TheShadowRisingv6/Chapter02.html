<h4><em>Whirlpools in the Pattern</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">I</span>nland
the hot night wind blew, north across the vast
delta called the Fingers of the Dragon, a winding maze of waterways
broad and narrow, some choked with knifegrass. Vast plains of reeds
separated clusters of low islands forested with spider-rooted trees
seen nowhere else. Eventually the delta gave way to its source, the
River Erinin, the river&rsquo;s great width spotted with the lights of
small boats lantern-fishing. Boats and lights bobbed wildly, sudden
and unexpected, and some older men muttered of evil things passing
in the night. Young men laughed, but they hauled the nets more
vigorously, too, eager to be home and out of the dark. The stories
said evil could not cross your threshold unless you invited it in.
That was what the stories said. But out in the darkness&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The last tang of salt had vanished by the time the
wind reached the great city of Tear, hard by the river, where
tile-roofed inns and shops shouldered against tall, towered palaces
gleaming in the moonlight. Yet no place was half so tall as the
massive bulk, almost a mountain, that stretched from city&rsquo;s heart
to water&rsquo;s edge. The Stone of Tear, fortress of legend, the oldest
stronghold of mankind, erected in the last days of the Breaking of
the World. While nations and empires rose and fell, were replaced
and fell anew, the Stone stood. It was the rock on which armies had
broken spears and swords and hearts for three thousand years. And
in all that time it had never fallen to invading arms. Until
now.</p>

<p>The streets of the city, the taverns and inns, were
all but empty in the muggy darkness, people keeping cautiously
within their own walls. Who held the Stone was lord of Tear, city
and nation. That was the way it had always been, and the people of
Tear accepted it always. By daylight they would cheer their new
lord with enthusiasm as they had cheered the old; by night they
huddled together, shivering despite the heat when the wind howled
across their rooftops like a thousand keening mourners. Strange new
hopes danced in their heads, hopes none in Tear had dared for a
hundred generations, hopes mixed with fears as old as the
Breaking.</p>

<p>The wind lashed the long, white banner catching the
moon above the Stone as if trying to rip it away. Along its length
marched a sinuous figure like a legged serpent, golden-maned like a
lion, scaled in scarlet and gold, seeming to ride the wind. Banner
of prophecy, hoped for and dreaded. Banner of the Dragon. The
Dragon Reborn. Harbinger of the world&rsquo;s salvation, and herald of a
new Breaking to come. As if outraged at such defiance, the wind
dashed itself against the hard walls of the Stone. The Dragon
banner floated, unheeding in the night, awaiting greater
storms.</p>

<p>In a room more than halfway up the Stone&rsquo;s southern
face, Perrin sat on the chest at the foot of his canopied bed and
watched the dark-haired young woman pacing up and down. There was a
trace of wariness in his golden eyes. Usually Faile bantered with
him, maybe poked a little gentle fun at his deliberate ways;
tonight she had not said ten words since coming through the door.
He could smell the rose petals that had been folded into her
clothes after cleaning, and the scent that was just her. And in the
hint of clean perspiration, he smelled nervousness. Faile almost
never showed nerves. Wondering why she did now set an itch between
his shoulders that had nothing to do with the night&rsquo;s heat. Her
narrow, divided skirts made a soft <em>whisk-whisk-whisk</em> with
her strides.</p>

<p>He scratched his two-week growth of beard irritably.
It was even curlier than the hair on his head. It was also hot. For
the hundredth time he thought of shaving.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It suits you,&rdquo; Faile said suddenly, stopping in her
tracks.</p>

<p>Uncomfortably, he shrugged shoulders heavy from long
hours working at a forge. She did that sometimes, seemed to know
what he was thinking. &ldquo;It itches,&rdquo; he muttered, and wished he had
spoken more forcefully. It was his beard; he could shave it off any
time he wanted.</p>

<p>She studied him, her head tilted to one side. Her
bold nose and high cheekbones made it seem a fierce study, a
contrast to the soft voice in which she said, &ldquo;It looks right on
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin sighed, and shrugged again. She had not asked
him to keep the beard, and she would not. Yet he knew he was going
to put off shaving again. He wondered how his friend Mat would
handle this situation. Probably with a pinch and a kiss and some
remark that made her laugh until he brought her around to his way
of thinking. But Perrin knew he did not have Mat&rsquo;s way with the
girls. Mat would never find himself sweating behind a beard just
because a woman thought he should have hair on his face. Unless,
maybe, the woman was Faile. Perrin suspected that her father must
deeply regret her leaving home, and not just because she was his
daughter. He was the biggest fur trader in Saldaea, so she claimed,
and Perrin could see her getting the price she wanted every
time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something is troubling you, Faile, and it isn&rsquo;t my
beard. What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her expression became guarded. She looked everywhere
but at him, making a contemptuous survey of the room&rsquo;s
furnishings.</p>

<p>Carvings of leopards and lions, stooping hawks and
hunting scenes decorated everything from the tall wardrobe and
bedposts as thick as his leg to the padded bench in front of the
cold marble fireplace. Some of the animals had garnet eyes.</p>

<p>He had tried to convince the majhere that he wanted a
simple room, but she did not seem to understand. Not that she was
stupid or slow. The majhere commanded an army of servants greater
in numbers than the Defenders of the Stone; whoever commanded the
Stone, whoever held its walls, she saw to the day-to-day matters
that let everything function. But she looked at the world through
Tairen eyes. Despite his clothes, he must be more than the young
countryman he seemed, because commoners were never housed in the
Stone&mdash;save for Defenders and servants, of course. Beyond
that, he was one of Rand&rsquo;s party, a friend or a follower or in any
case close to the Dragon Reborn in some way. To the majhere, that
set him on a level with a Lord of the Land at the very least, if
not a High Lord. She had been scandalized enough at putting him in
here, without even a sitting room; he thought she might have
fainted if he had insisted on an even plainer chamber. If there
were such things short of the servants&rsquo; quarters, or the
Defenders&rsquo;. At least nothing here was gilded except the
candlesticks.</p>

<p>Faile&rsquo;s opinions, though, were not his. &ldquo;You should
have better than this. You deserve it. You can wager your last
copper that Mat has better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat likes gaudy things,&rdquo; he said simply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not stand up for yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not comment. It was not his rooms that made
her smell of unease, any more than his beard.</p>

<p>After a moment, she said, &ldquo;The Lord Dragon seems to
have lost interest in you. All his time is taken by the High Lords,
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The itch between his shoulders worsened; he knew what
was troubling her now. He tried to make his voice light. &ldquo;The Lord
Dragon? You sound like a Tairen. His name is Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s your friend, Perrin Aybara, not mine. If a man
like that has friends.&rdquo; She drew a deep breath and went on in a
more moderate tone. &ldquo;I have been thinking about leaving the Stone.
Leaving Tear. I don&rsquo;t think Moiraine would try to stop me. News of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;of Rand has been leaving the city for two weeks, now. She
can&rsquo;t think to keep him secret any longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He only just stopped another sigh. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she
will, either. If anything, I think she considers you a
complication. She will probably give you money to see you on your
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Planting fists on hips, she moved to stare down at
him. &ldquo;Is that all you have to say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want me to say? That I want you to
stay?&rdquo; The anger in his own voice startled him. He was angry with
himself, not her. Angry because he had not seen this coming, angry
because he could not see how to deal with it. He liked being able
to think things through. It was easy to hurt people without meaning
to when you were hasty. He&rsquo;d done that now. Her dark eyes were
large with shock. He tried to smooth his words. &ldquo;I do want you to
stay, Faile, but maybe you should leave. I know you&rsquo;re no coward,
but the Dragon Reborn, the Forsaken&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Not that anywhere was
really safe&mdash;not for long, not now&mdash;yet there were
safer places than the Stone. For a while, anyway. Not that he was
stupid enough to put it to her that way.</p>

<p>But she did not appear to care how he put it. &ldquo;Stay?
The Light illumine me! Anything is better than sitting here like a
boulder, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She knelt gracefully in front of him, resting
her hands on his knees. &ldquo;Perrin. I do not like wondering when one
of the Forsaken is going to walk around the corner in front of me,
and I do not like wondering when the Dragon Reborn is going to kill
us all. He did it back in the Breaking, after all. Killed everyone
close to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand isn&rsquo;t Lews Therin Kinslayer,&rdquo; Perrin protested.
&ldquo;I mean, he <em>is</em> the Dragon Reborn, but he isn&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;he
wouldn&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He trailed off, not knowing how to finish. Rand
was Lews Therin Telamon reborn; that was what being the Dragon
Reborn meant. But did it mean Rand was doomed to Lews Therin&rsquo;s
fate? Not just going mad&mdash;any man who channeled had that fate
in front of him, and then a rotting death&mdash;but killing
everyone who cared for him?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been talking to Bain and Chiad, Perrin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was no surprise. She spent considerable time
with the Aiel women. The friendship made some trouble for her, but
she seemed to like the Aiel women as much as she despised the
Stone&rsquo;s Tairen noblewomen. But he saw no connection to what they
were talking about, and he said so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say Moiraine sometimes asks where you are. Or
Mat. Don&rsquo;t you see? She would not have to do that if she could
watch you with the Power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch me with the Power?&rdquo; he said faintly. He had
never even considered that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She cannot. Come with me, Perrin. We can be twenty
miles across the river before she misses us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said miserably. He tried diverting her
with a kiss, but she leaped to her feet and backed away so fast he
nearly fell on his face. There was no point going after her. She
had her arms crossed beneath her breasts like a barrier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me you are that afraid of her. I know she
is Aes Sedai, and she has all of you dancing when she twitches the
strings. Perhaps she has the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Rand&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;so tied he cannot get
loose, and the Light knows Egwene and Elayne, and even Nynaeve,
don&rsquo;t want to, but you can break her cords if you try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has nothing to do with Moiraine. It&rsquo;s what I have
to do. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She cut him short. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare hand me any of
that hairy-chested drivel about a man having to do his duty. I know
duty as well as you, and you have no duty here. You may be <em>
ta&rsquo;veren</em>, even if I don&rsquo;t see it, but he is the Dragon Reborn,
not you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you listen?&rdquo; he shouted, glaring, and she
jumped. He had never shouted at her before, not like that. She
raised her chin and shifted her shoulders, but she did not say
anything. He went on. &ldquo;I think I am part of Rand&rsquo;s destiny,
somehow. Mat, too. I think he can&rsquo;t do what he has to unless we do
our part, as well. That is the duty. How can I walk away if it
might mean Rand will fail?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Might?&rdquo; There was a hint of demand in her voice, but
only a hint. He wondered if he could make himself shout at her more
often. &ldquo;Did Moiraine tell you this, Perrin? You should know by now
to listen closely to what an Aes Sedai says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I worked it out for myself. I think <em>
ta&rsquo;veren</em> are pulled toward each other. Or maybe Rand pulls us,
Mat and me both. He&rsquo;s supposed to be the strongest <em>
ta&rsquo;veren</em> since Artur Hawkwing, maybe since the Breaking. Mat
won&rsquo;t even admit he&rsquo;s <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, but however he tries to
get away, he always ends up drawn back to Rand. Loial says he has
never heard of three <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, all the same age and all
from the same place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faile sniffed loudly. &ldquo;Loial does not know
everything. He isn&rsquo;t very old for an Ogier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s past ninety,&rdquo; Perrin said defensively, and she
gave him a tight smile. For an Ogier, ninety years was not much
older than Perrin. Or maybe younger. He did not know much about
Ogier. In any case, Loial had read more books than Perrin had ever
seen or even heard of; sometimes he thought Loial had read every
book ever printed. &ldquo;And he knows more than you or I do. He believes
maybe I have the right of it. And so does Moiraine. No, I haven&rsquo;t
asked her, but why else does she keep a watch on me? Did you think
she wanted me to make her a kitchen knife?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment, and when she spoke it
was in sympathetic tones. &ldquo;Poor Perrin. I left Saldaea to find
adventure, and now that I&rsquo;m in the heart of one, the greatest since
the Breaking, all I want is to go somewhere else. You just want to
be a blacksmith, and you&rsquo;re going to end up in the stories whether
you want it or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked away, though the scent of her still filled
his head. He did not think he was likely to have any stories told
about him, not unless his secret spread a long way beyond the few
who knew already. Faile thought she knew everything about him, but
she was wrong.</p>

<p>An axe and a hammer leaned against the wall opposite
him, each plain and functional with a haft as long as his forearm.
The axe was a wicked half-moon blade balanced by a thick spike,
meant for violence. With the hammer he could make things, had made
things, at a forge. The hammerhead weighed more than twice as much
as the axe blade, but it was the axe that felt heavier by far every
time he picked it up. With the axe, he had&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He scowled, not
wanting to think about that. She was right. All he wanted was to be
a blacksmith, to go home, and see his family again, and work at the
smithy. But it was not to be; he knew that.</p>

<p>He got to his feet long enough to pick up the hammer,
then sat back down. There was something comforting in holding it.
&ldquo;Master Luhhan always says you can&rsquo;t walk away from what has to be
done.&rdquo; He hurried on, realizing that was a little too close to what
she had called hairy-chested drivel. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the blacksmith back
home, the man I was apprenticed to. I&rsquo;ve told you about him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To his surprise, she did not take the opportunity to
point out his near echo. In fact, she said nothing, only looked at
him, waiting for something. After a moment it came to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you leaving, then?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>She stood up, brushing her skirt. For a long moment
she kept silent, as if deciding on her answer. &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; she
said finally. &ldquo;This is a fine mess you&rsquo;ve put me in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me? What did I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you don&rsquo;t know, I am certainly not going to
tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scratching his beard again, he stared at the hammer
in his other hand. Mat would probably know exactly what she meant.
Or even old Thom Merrilin. The white-haired gleeman claimed no one
understood women, but when he came out of his tiny room in the
belly of the Stone he soon had half a dozen girls young enough to
be his granddaughters sighing and listening to him play the harp
and tell of grand adventure and romance. Faile was the only woman
Perrin wanted, but sometimes he felt like a fish trying to
understand a bird.</p>

<p>He knew she wanted him to ask. He knew that much. She
might or might not tell him, but he was supposed to ask.</p>

<p>Stubbornly he kept his mouth shut. This time he meant
to wait her out.</p>

<p>Outside in the darkness, a cock crowed.</p>

<p>Faile shivered and hugged herself. &ldquo;My nurse used to
say that meant a death coming. Not that I believe it, of
course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He opened his mouth to agree it was foolishness,
though he shivered, too, but his head whipped around at a
grating sound and a thump. The axe had toppled to the floor. He
only had time to frown, wondering what could have made it fall,
when it shifted again, untouched, then leaped straight for him.</p>

<p>He swung the hammer without thought. Metal ringing on
metal drowned Faile&rsquo;s scream; the axe flew across the room, bounced
off the far wall, and darted back at him, blade first. He thought
every hair on his body was trying to stand on end.</p>

<p>As the axe sped by her, Faile lunged forward and
grabbed the haft with both hands. It twisted in her grip, slashing
toward her wide-eyed face. Barely in time Perrin leaped up,
dropping the hammer to seize the axe, just keeping the half-moon
blade from her flesh. He thought he would die if the axe&mdash;his
axe&mdash;harmed her. He jerked it away from her so hard that the
heavy spike nearly stabbed him in the chest. It would have been a
fair trade, to stop the axe from hurting her, but with a sinking
feeling he began to think it might not be possible.</p>

<p>The weapon thrashed like a thing alive, a thing with
a malevolent will. It wanted Perrin&mdash;he knew that as if it
had shouted at him&mdash;but it fought with cunning. When he
pulled the axe away from Faile, it used his own movement to hack at
him; when he forced it from himself, it tried to reach her, as if
it knew that would make him stop pushing. No matter how hard he
held the haft, it spun in his hands, threatening with spike or
curved blade. Already his hands ached from the effort, and his
thick arms strained, muscles tight. Sweat rolled down his face. He
was not sure how much longer it would be before the axe fought free
of his grip. This was all madness, pure madness, with no time to
think.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out,&rdquo; he muttered through gritted teeth. &ldquo;Get
out of the room, Faile!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her face was bloodless pale, but she shook her head
and wrestled with the axe. &ldquo;No! I will not leave you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will kill both of us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head again.</p>

<p>Growling in his throat, he let go of the axe with one
hand&mdash;his arm quivered with holding the thing one-handed; the
twisting haft burned his palm&mdash;and thrust Faile away. She yelped as
he wrestled her to the door. Ignoring her shouts and her fists
pounding at him, he held her against the wall with a shoulder until
he could pull the door open and shove her into the hallway.</p>

<p>Slamming the door behind her, he put his back against
it, sliding the latch home with his hip as he seized the axe with
both hands again. The heavy blade, gleaming and sharp, trembled
within inches of his face. Laboriously, he pushed it out to arm&rsquo;s
length. Faile&rsquo;s muted shouts penetrated the thick door, and he
could feel her beating on it, but he was barely conscious of her.
His yellow eyes seemed to shine, as if they reflected every scrap
of light in the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just you and me, now,&rdquo; he snarled at the axe. &ldquo;Blood
and ashes, how I hate you!&rdquo; Inside, a part of him came close to
hysterical laughter. <em>Rand is the one who&rsquo;s supposed to go mad,
and here I am, talking to an axe! Rand! Burn him!</em></p>

<p>Teeth bared with effort, he forced the axe back a
full step from the door. The weapon vibrated, fighting to reach
flesh; he could almost taste its thirst for his blood. With a roar
he suddenly pulled the curved blade toward him, threw himself back.
Had the axe truly been alive, he was sure he would have heard a cry
of triumph as it flashed toward his head. At the last instant, he
twisted, driving the axe past himself. With a heavy <em>thunk</em>
the blade buried itself in the door.</p>

<p>He felt the life&mdash;he could not think what else
to call it&mdash;go out of the imprisoned weapon. Slowly, he took
his hands away. The axe stayed where it was, only steel and wood
again. The door seemed a good place to leave it for now, though. He
wiped sweat from his face with a shaking hand. <em>Madness. Madness
walks wherever Rand is</em>.</p>

<p>Abruptly he realized he could no longer hear Faile&rsquo;s
shouts, or her pounding. Throwing back the latch, he hastily pulled
the door open. A gleaming arc of steel stuck through the thick wood
on the outside, shining in the light of wide-spaced lamps along the
tapestry-hung hallway.</p>

<p>Faile stood there, hands raised, frozen in the act of
beating on the door. Eyes wide and wondering, she touched the tip
of her nose. &ldquo;Another inch,&rdquo; she said faintly, &ldquo;and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a sudden start, she flung herself on him,
hugging him fiercely, raining kisses on his neck and beard between
incoherent murmurs. Just as quickly, she pushed back, running
anxious hands over his chest and arms. &ldquo;Are you hurt? Are you
injured? Did it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;But are you? I did not
mean to frighten you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She peered up at him. &ldquo;Truly? You are not hurt in any
way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Completely unhurt. I&mdash;&rdquo; Her full-armed slap
made his head ring like hammer on anvil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You great hairy lummox! I thought you were dead! I
was afraid it had killed you! I thought&mdash;!&rdquo; She cut off as he
caught her second slap in midswing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t do that again,&rdquo; he said quietly. The
smarting imprint of her hand burned on his cheek, and he thought
his jaw would ache the rest of the night.</p>

<p>He gripped her wrist as gently as he would have a
bird, but though she struggled to pull free, his hand did not budge
an inch. Compared to swinging a hammer all day at the forge,
holding her was no effort at all, even after his fight against the
axe. Abruptly she seemed to decide to ignore his grip and stared
him in the eye; neither dark nor golden eyes blinked. &ldquo;I could have
helped you. You had no right&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had every right,&rdquo; he said firmly. &ldquo;You could not
have helped. If you had stayed, we&rsquo;d both be dead. I couldn&rsquo;t have
fought&mdash;not the way I had to&mdash;and kept you safe, too.&rdquo;
She opened her mouth, but he raised his voice and went on. &ldquo;I know
you hate the word. I&rsquo;ll try my best not to treat you like
porcelain, but if you ask me to watch you die, I will tie you like
a lamb for market and send you off to Mistress Luhhan. She won&rsquo;t
stand for any such nonsense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tonguing a tooth and wondering if it was loose, he
almost wished he could see Faile trying to ride roughshod over
Alsbet Luhhan. The blacksmith&rsquo;s wife kept her husband in line with
scarcely more effort than she needed for her house. Even Nynaeve
had been careful of her sharp tongue around Mistress Luhhan. The
tooth still held tight, he decided.</p>

<p>Faile laughed suddenly, a low, throaty laugh. &ldquo;You
would, too, wouldn&rsquo;t you? Don&rsquo;t think you would not dance with the
Dark One if you tried, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin was so startled he let go of her. He could not
see any real difference between what he had just said and what he
had said before, but the one had made her blaze up, while this she
took&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;fondly. Not that he was certain the threat to kill him
was entirely a joke. Faile carried knives hidden about her person,
and she knew how to use them.</p>

<p>She rubbed her wrist ostentatiously and muttered
something under her breath. He caught the words &ldquo;hairy ox,&rdquo; and
promised himself he would shave every last whisker of that fool
beard. He would.</p>

<p>Aloud, she said, &ldquo;The axe. That was him, wasn&rsquo;t it?
The Dragon Reborn, trying to kill us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must have been Rand.&rdquo; He emphasized the name. He
did not like thinking of Rand the other way. He preferred
remembering the Rand he had grown up with in Emond&rsquo;s Field. &ldquo;Not
trying to kill us, though. Not him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave him a wry smile, more a grimace. &ldquo;If he was
not trying, I hope he never does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what he was doing. But I mean to tell
him to stop it, and right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I care for a man who worries so
about his own safety,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>

<p>He frowned at her quizzically, wondering what she
meant, but she only tucked her arm through his. He was still
wondering as they started off through the Stone. The axe he left
where it was; stuck in the door, it would not harm anyone.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Teeth clamped on a long-stemmed pipe, Mat opened his
coat a bit more and tried to concentrate on the cards lying
facedown in front of him, and on the coins spilled in the middle of
the table. He had had the bright red coat made to an Andoran
pattern, of the best wool, with golden embroidery scrolling around
the cuffs and long collar, but day by day he was reminded how much
farther south Tear lay than Andor. Sweat ran down his face, and
plastered the shift to his back.</p>

<p>None of his companions around the table appeared to
notice the heat at all, despite coats that looked even heavier than
his, with fat, swollen sleeves, all padded silks and brocades and
satin stripes. Two men in red-and-gold livery kept the gamblers&rsquo;
silver cups full of wine and proffered shining silver trays of
olives and cheeses and nuts. The heat did not seem to affect the
servants, either, though now and again one of them yawned behind
his hand when he thought no one was looking. The night was not
young.</p>

<p>Mat refrained from lifting his cards to check them
again. They would not have changed. Three rulers, the highest cards
in three of the five suits, were already good enough to win most
hands.</p>

<p>He would have been more comfortable dicing; there was
seldom a deck of cards to be found in the places he usually
gambled, where silver changed hands in fifty different dice games,
but these young Tairen lordlings would rather wear rags than play
at dice. Peasants tossed dice, though they were careful not to say
so in his hearing. It was not his temper they feared, but who they
thought his friends were. This game called chop was what they
played, hour after hour, night after night, using cards
hand-painted and lacquered by a man in the city who had been made
well-to-do by these fellows and others like them. Only women or
horses could draw them away, but neither for long.</p>

<p>Still, he had picked up the game quickly enough, and
if his luck was not as good as it was with dice, it would do. A fat
purse lay beside his cards, and another even fatter rested in his
pocket. A fortune, he would have thought once, back in Emond&rsquo;s
Field, enough to live the rest of his life in luxury. His ideas of
luxury had changed since leaving the Two Rivers. The young lords
kept their coin in careless, shining piles, but some old habits he
had no intention of changing. In the taverns and inns it was
sometimes necessary to depart quickly. Especially if his luck was
really with him.</p>

<p>When he had enough to keep himself as he wanted, he
would leave the Stone just as quickly. Before Moiraine knew what he
was thinking. He would have been days gone by now, if he had had
his way. It was just that there was gold to be had here. One night
at this table could earn him more than a week of dicing in taverns.
If only his luck would catch.</p>

<p>He put on a small frown and puffed worriedly at his
pipe, to look unsure whether his cards were good enough to go on
with. Two of the young lords had pipes in their teeth, too, but
silver-worked, with amber bits. In the hot, still air, their
perfumed tabac smelled like a fire in a lady&rsquo;s dressing chamber.
Not that Mat had ever been in a lady&rsquo;s dressing chamber. An illness
that nearly killed him had left his memory as full of holes as the
best lace, yet he was sure he would have remembered that. <em>Not
even the Dark One would be mean enough to make me forget
that</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sea Folk ship docked today,&rdquo; Reimon muttered around
his pipe. The broad-shouldered young lord&rsquo;s beard was oiled and
trimmed to a neat point. That was the latest fashion among the
younger lords, and Reimon chased the latest fashion as assiduously
as he chased women. Which was only a little less diligently than he
gambled. He tossed a silver crown onto the pile in the middle of
the table for another card. &ldquo;A raker. Fastest ships there are,
rakers, so they say. Outrun the wind, they say. I would like to see
that. Burn my soul, but I would.&rdquo; He did not bother to look at the
card he was dealt; he never did until he had a full five.</p>

<p>The plump, pink-cheeked man between Reimon and Mat
gave an amused chuckle. &ldquo;You want to see the ship, Reimon? You mean
the girls, do you not? The women. Exotic Sea Folk beauties, with
their rings and baubles and swaying walks, eh?&rdquo; He put in a crown
and took his card, grimacing when he peeked at it. That meant
nothing; going by his face, Edorion&rsquo;s cards were always low and
mismatched. He won more than he lost, though. &ldquo;Well, perhaps my
luck will be better with the Sea Folk girls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dealer, tall and slender on Mat&rsquo;s other side,
with a pointed beard even more darkly luxuriant than Reimon&rsquo;s, laid
a finger alongside his nose. &ldquo;You think to be lucky with those,
Edorion? The way they keep to themselves, you&rsquo;ll be lucky to catch
a whiff of their perfume.&rdquo; He made a wafting gesture, inhaling
deeply with a sigh, and the other lordlings laughed, even
Edorion.</p>

<p>A plain-faced youth named Estean laughed loudest of
all, scrubbing a hand through lank hair that kept falling over his
forehead. Replace his fine yellow coat with drab wool, and he could
have passed for a farmer, instead of the son of a High Lord with
the richest estates in Tear and in his own right the wealthiest man
at the table. He had also drunk much more wine than any of the
others.</p>

<p>Swaying across the man next to him, a foppish fellow
named Baran who always seemed to be looking down his sharp nose,
Estean poked the dealer with a none too steady finger. Baran leaned
back, twisting his mouth around his pipestem as if he feared Estean
might throw up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, Carlomin,&rdquo; Estean gurgled. &ldquo;You think
so too, don&rsquo;t you, Baran? Edorion won&rsquo;t get a sniff. If he wants to
try his luck&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;take a gamble&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;he ought to go after the
Aiel wenches, like Mat, here. All those spears and knives. Burn my
soul. Like asking a lion to dance.&rdquo; Dead silence dropped around the
table. Estean laughed on alone, then blinked and scrubbed fingers
through his hair again. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Did I say something?
Oh! Oh, yes. Them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat barely stopped a scowl. The fool had to bring up
the Aiel. The only worse subject would have been Aes Sedai; they
would almost rather have Aiel walking the corridors, staring down
any Tairen who got in their way, than even one Aes Sedai, and these
men thought they had four, at least. He fingered an Andoran silver
crown from his purse on the table and pushed it into the pot.
Carlomin dealt out the card slowly.</p>

<p>Mat lifted it carefully with a thumbnail, and did not
let himself so much as blink. The Ruler of Cups, a High Lord of
Tear. The rulers in a deck varied according to the land where the
cards were made, with the nation&rsquo;s own ruler always as Ruler of
Cups, the highest suit. These cards were old. He had already seen
new decks with Rand&rsquo;s face or something like it on the Ruler of
Cups, complete with the Dragon banner. Rand the ruler of Tear; that
still seemed ludicrous enough to make him want to pinch himself.
Rand was a shepherd, a good fellow to have fun with when he was not
going all over-serious and responsible. Rand the Dragon Reborn,
now; that told him he was a stone fool to be sitting there, where
Moiraine could put her hand on him whenever she wanted, waiting to
see what Rand would do next. Maybe Thom Merrilin would go with him.
Or Perrin. Only, Thom seemed to be settling into the Stone as if he
never meant to leave, and Perrin was not going anywhere unless
Faile crooked a finger. Well, Mat was ready to travel alone, if
need be.</p>

<p>Yet there was silver in the middle of the table and
gold in front of the lordlings, and if he was dealt the fifth
ruler, there was no hand in chop could beat him. Not that he really
needed it. Suddenly he could feel luck tickling his mind. Not
tingling as it did with the dice, of course, but he was already
certain no one was going to beat four rulers. The Tairens had been
betting wildly all night, the price of ten farms crossing the table
on the quickest hands.</p>

<p>But Carlomin was staring at the deck of cards in his
hand instead of buying his fourth, and Baran was puffing his pipe
furiously and stacking the coins in front of him as if ready to
stuff them into his pockets. Reimon wore a scowl behind his beard,
and Edorion was frowning at his nails. Only Estean appeared
unaffected; he grinned uncertainly around the table, perhaps
already forgetting what he had said. They usually managed to put
some sort of good face on the situation if the Aiel came up, but
the hour was late, and the wine had flowed freely.</p>

<p>Mat scoured his mind for a way to keep them and their
gold from walking away from his cards. One glance at their faces
was enough to tell him that simply changing the subject would not
be enough. But there was another way. If he made them laugh at the
Aiel&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Is it worth making them laugh at me, too?</em>
Chewing his pipestem, he tried to think of something else.</p>

<p>Baran picked up a stack of gold in each hand and
moved to stick them in his pockets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might just try these Sea Folk women,&rdquo; Mat said
quickly, taking his pipe to gesture with. &ldquo;Odd things happen when
you chase Aiel girls. Very odd. Like the game they call Maidens&rsquo;
Kiss.&rdquo; He had their attention, but Baran had not put down the
coins, and Carlomin still showed no sign of buying a card.</p>

<p>Estean gave a drunken guffaw. &ldquo;Kiss you with steel in
your ribs, I suppose. Maidens of the Spear, you see. Steel. Spear
in your ribs. Burn my soul.&rdquo; No one else laughed. But they were
listening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite.&rdquo; Mat managed a grin. <em>Burn me, I&rsquo;ve
told this much. I might as well tell the rest</em>. &ldquo;Rhuarc said if
I wanted to get along with the Maidens, I should ask them how to
play Maidens&rsquo; Kiss. He said that was the best way to get to
know them.&rdquo; It still sounded like one of the kissing games back
home, like Kiss the Daisies. He had never considered the Aiel clan
chief a man to play tricks. He would be warier the next time. He
made an effort to improve the grin. &ldquo;So I went along to Bain and .
. .&rdquo; Reimon frowned impatiently. None of them knew any Aiel&rsquo;s name
but Rhuarc, and none of them wanted to. Mat dropped the names and
hurried on &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;went along dumb as a bull-goose fool, and asked
them to show me.&rdquo; He should have suspected something from the wide
smiles that had bloomed on their faces. Like cats who had been
asked to dance by a mouse. &ldquo;Before I knew what was happening, I had
a fistful of spears around my neck like a collar. I could have
shaved myself with one sneeze.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The others around the table exploded in laughter,
from Reimon&rsquo;s wheezing to Estean&rsquo;s wine-soaked bray.</p>

<p>Mat left them to it. He could almost feel the
spearpoints again, pricking if he so much as twitched a finger.
Bain, laughing all the while, had told him she had never heard of a
man actually asking to play Maidens&rsquo; Kiss.</p>

<p>Carlomin stroked his beard and spoke into Mat&rsquo;s
hesitation. &ldquo;You cannot stop there. Go on. When was this? Two
nights ago, I&rsquo;ll wager. When you didn&rsquo;t come for the game, and no
one knew where you were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was playing stones with Thom Merrilin that night,&rdquo;
Mat said quickly. &ldquo;This was days ago.&rdquo; He was glad he could lie
with a straight face. &ldquo;They each took a kiss. That&rsquo;s all. If she
thought it was a good kiss, they eased up with the spears. If not,
they pushed a little harder; to encourage, you might say. That was
all. I&rsquo;ll tell you this; I got nicked less than I do shaving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stuck his pipe back between his teeth. If they
wanted to know more, they could go ask to play the game themselves.
He almost hoped some of them were fool enough. <em>Bloody Aiel
women and their bloody spears</em>. He had not made it to his own
bed until daybreak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be more than enough for me,&rdquo; Carlomin said
dryly. &ldquo;The Light burn my soul if it would not.&rdquo; He tossed a silver
crown into the center of the table and dealt himself another card.
&ldquo;Maidens&rsquo; Kiss.&rdquo; He shook with mirth, and another ripple of
laughter ran around the table.</p>

<p>Baran bought his fifth card, and Estean fumbled a
coin from the heap scattered in front of him, peering at it to see
what it was. They would not stop now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Savages,&rdquo; Baran muttered around his pipe. &ldquo;Ignorant
savages. That is all they are, burn my soul. Live in caves, out in
the Waste. In caves! No one but a savage could live in the
Waste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reimon nodded. &ldquo;At least they serve the Lord Dragon.
I would take a hundred Defenders and clean them out of the Stone,
if not for that.&rdquo; Baran and Carlomin growled fierce agreement.</p>

<p>It was no effort for Mat to keep his face straight.
He had heard much the same before. Boasting was easy when no one
expected you to carry through. A hundred Defenders? Even if Rand
stood aside for some reason, the few hundred Aiel holding the Stone
could probably keep it against any army Tear could raise. Not that
they seemed to want the Stone, really. Mat suspected they were only
there because Rand was. He did not think any of these lordlings had
figured that out&mdash;they tried to ignore the Aiel as much as
possible&mdash;but he doubted it would make them feel any
better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat.&rdquo; Estean fanned his cards out in one hand,
rearranging them as if he could not decide what order they were
meant to go in. &ldquo;Mat, you will speak to the Lord Dragon, won&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About what?&rdquo; Mat asked cautiously. Too many of these
Tairens knew he and Rand had grown up together to suit him, and
they seemed to think he was arm in arm with Rand when ever he was
out of their sight. None of them would have gone near his own
brother if he could channel. He did not know why they thought him a
bigger fool.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I say?&rdquo; The plain-faced man squinted at his
cards and scratched his head, then brightened. &ldquo;Oh, yes. His
proclamation, Mat. The Lord Dragon&rsquo;s. His last one. Where he said
commoners had the right to call lords before a magistrate. Who ever
heard of a lord being summoned to a magistrate? And for
peasants!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat&rsquo;s hand tightened on his purse until the coins
inside grated together. &ldquo;It would be a shame,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;if
you were tried and judged just for having your way with a
fisherman&rsquo;s daughter whatever she wanted, or for having some farmer
beaten for splashing mud on your cloak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The others shifted uneasily, catching his mood, but
Estean nodded, head bobbing so it seemed about to fall off.
&ldquo;Exactly. Though it wouldn&rsquo;t come to that, of course. A lord being
tried before a magistrate? Of course not. Not really.&rdquo; He laughed
drunkenly at his cards. &ldquo;No fishermen&rsquo;s daughters. Smell of fish,
you see, however you have them washed. A plump farm girl is
best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat told himself he was there to gamble. He told
himself to ignore the fool&rsquo;s blather, reminded himself of how much
gold he could take out of Estean&rsquo;s purse. His tongue did not
listen, though. &ldquo;Who knows what it might come to? Hangings,
maybe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edorion gave him a sidelong look, guarded and uneasy.
&ldquo;Do we have to talk about&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;about commoners, Estean? What about
old Astoril&rsquo;s daughters? Have you decided which you&rsquo;ll marry
yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? Oh. Oh, I&rsquo;ll flip a coin, I suppose.&rdquo; Estean
frowned at his cards, shifted one, and frowned again. &ldquo;Medore has
two or three pretty maids. Perhaps Medore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat took a long drink from his silver wine cup to
keep from hitting the man in his farmer&rsquo;s face. He was still on his
first cup; the two servants had given up trying to add more. If he
hit Estean, none of them would lift a hand to stop him. Not even
Estean. Because he was the Lord Dragon&rsquo;s friend. He wished he was
in a tavern somewhere out in the city, where some dockman might
question his luck and only a quick tongue, or quick feet, or quick
hands would see him leave with a whole skin. Now that <em>was</em>
a fool thought.</p>

<p>Edorion glanced at Mat again, measuring his mood. &ldquo;I
heard a rumor today. I hear the Lord Dragon is taking us to war
with Illian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat gagged on his wine. &ldquo;War?&rdquo; he spluttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;War,&rdquo; Reimon agreed happily around his pipestem.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you certain?&rdquo; Carlomin said, and Baran added,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard no rumors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard it just today, from three or four tongues.&rdquo;
Edorion seemed to be absorbed in his cards. &ldquo;Who can say how true
it is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be true,&rdquo; Reimon said. &ldquo;With the Lord Dragon
to lead us, holding <em>Callandor</em>, we&rsquo;ll not even have to
fight. He will scatter their armies, and we will march straight
into Illian. Too bad, in a way. Burn my soul if it isn&rsquo;t. I would
like a chance to match swords with the Illianers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get no chance with the Lord Dragon leading,&rdquo;
Baran said. &ldquo;They will fall on their knees as soon as they see the
Dragon banner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if they do not,&rdquo; Carlomin added with a laugh,
&ldquo;the Lord Dragon will blast them with lightning where they
stand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Illian first,&rdquo; Reimon said. &ldquo;And then&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;then
we&rsquo;ll conquer the world for the Lord Dragon. You tell him I said
so, Mat. The whole world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat shook his head. A month gone, they would have
been horrified by even the idea of a man who could channel, a man
doomed to go mad and die horribly. Now they were ready to follow
Rand into battle, and trust his power to win for them. Trust the
Power, though it was not likely they would put it that way. Yet he
supposed they had to find something to hang on to. The invincible
Stone was in the hands of the Aiel. The Dragon Reborn was in his
chambers a hundred feet above their heads, and <em>Callandor</em>
was with him. Three thousand years of Tairen belief and history lay
in ruins, and the world had been turned on its head. He wondered
whether he had handled it any better; his own world had gone all
askew in little more than a year. He rolled a gold Tairen crown
across the backs of his fingers. However well he had done, he would
not go back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When will we march, Mat?&rdquo; Baran asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Rand
would start a war.&rdquo; Unless he had gone mad already. That hardly
bore thinking about.</p>

<p>The others looked as if he had assured them the sun
would not come up tomorrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are all loyal to the Lord Dragon, of course.&rdquo;
Edorion frowned at his cards. &ldquo;Out in the countryside, though&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I hear that some of the High Lords, a few, have been trying to
raise an army to take back the Stone.&rdquo; Suddenly no one was looking
at Mat, though Estean still seemed to be trying to make out his
cards. &ldquo;When the Lord Dragon takes us to war, of course, it will
all melt away. In any case, we are loyal, here in the Stone. The
High Lords, too, I am certain. It is only the few out in the
countryside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their loyalty would not outlast their fear of the
Dragon Reborn. For a moment Mat felt as though he were planning to
abandon Rand in a pit of vipers. Then he remembered what Rand was.
It was more like abandoning a weasel in a henyard. Rand had been a
friend. The Dragon Reborn, though&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Who could be a friend to
the Dragon Reborn? <em>I&rsquo;m not abandoning anybody. He could
probably pull the Stone down on their heads, if he wanted to. On my
head, too</em>. He told himself again that it was time to be
gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No fishermen&rsquo;s daughters,&rdquo; Estean mumbled. &ldquo;You will
speak to the Lord Dragon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is your turn, Mat,&rdquo; Carlomin said anxiously. He
looked half afraid, though what he feared&mdash;that Estean would anger
Mat again, or that the talk might go back to loyalty&mdash;was impossible
to say. &ldquo;Will you buy the fifth card, or stack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat realized he had not been paying attention.
Everyone but himself and Carlomin had five cards, though Reimon had
neatly stacked his facedown beside the pot to show that he was out.
Mat hesitated, pretending to think, then sighed and tossed another
coin toward the pile.</p>

<p>As the silver crown bounced end over end, he suddenly
felt luck grow from trickles to a flood. Every ping of silver
against wooden tabletop rang clear in his head; he could have
called face or sigil and known how the coin would land on any
bounce. Just as he knew what his next card would be before Carlomin
laid it in front of him.</p>

<p>Sliding his cards together on the table, he fanned
them in one hand. The Ruler of Flames stared at him alongside the
other four, the Amyrlin Seat balancing a flame on her palm, though
she looked nothing like Siuan Sanche. However the Tairens felt
about Aes Sedai, they acknowledged the power of Tar Valon, even if
Flames was the lowest suit.</p>

<p>What were the odds of being dealt all five? His luck
was best with random things, like dice, but perhaps a little more
was beginning to rub off on cards. &ldquo;The Light burn my bones to ash
if it is not so,&rdquo; he muttered. Or that was what he meant to
say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; Estean all but shouted. &ldquo;You cannot deny it
this time. That was the Old Tongue. Something about burning, and
bones.&rdquo; He grinned around the table. &ldquo;My tutor would be proud. I
ought to send him a gift. If I can find out where he went.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nobles were supposed to be able to speak the Old
Tongue, though in reality few knew more than Estean seemed to. The
young lords set to arguing over exactly what Mat had said. They
seemed to think it had been a comment on the heat.</p>

<p>Goose bumps pebbled Mat&rsquo;s skin as he tried to recall
the words that had just come out of his mouth. A string of
gibberish, yet it almost seemed he should understand. <em>Burn
Moiraine! If she&rsquo;d left me alone, I wouldn&rsquo;t have holes in my
memory big enough for a wagon and team, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be spouting</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>whatever it bloody is!</em> He would also be milking his
father&rsquo;s cows instead of walking the world with a pocketful of
gold, but he managed to ignore that part of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you here to gamble,&rdquo; he said harshly, &ldquo;or babble
like old women over their knitting!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To gamble,&rdquo; Baran said curtly. &ldquo;Three crowns, gold!&rdquo;
He tossed the coins onto the pot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And three more besides.&rdquo; Estean hiccoughed and added
six golden crowns to the pile.</p>

<p>Suppressing a grin, Mat forgot about the Old Tongue.
It was easy enough; he did not want to think about it. Besides, if
they were starting this strongly, he might win enough on this hand
to leave in the morning. <em>And if he&rsquo;s crazy enough to start a
war, I&rsquo;ll leave if I have to walk</em>.</p>

<p>Outside in the darkness, a cock crowed. Mat shifted
uneasily and told himself not to be foolish. No one was going to
die.</p>

<p>His eyes dropped to his cards&mdash;and blinked. The
Amyrlin&rsquo;s flame had been replaced by a knife. While he was telling
himself he was tired and seeing things, she plunged the tiny blade
into the back of his hand.</p>

<p>With a hoarse yell, he flung the cards away and
hurled himself backward, overturning his chair, kicking the table
with both feet as he fell. The air seemed to thicken like honey.
Everything moved as if time had slowed, but at the same time
everything seemed to happen at once. Other cries echoed his, hollow
shouts reverberating inside a cavern. He and the chair drifted back
and down; the table floated upward.</p>

<p>The Ruler of Flames hung in the air, growing larger,
staring at him with a cruel smile. Now close to life-size, she
started to step out of the card; she was still a painted shape,
with no depth, but she reached for him with her blade, red with his
blood as if it had already been driven into his heart. Beside her
the Ruler of Cups began to grow, the Tairen High Lord drawing his
sword.</p>

<p>Mat floated, yet somehow he managed to reach the
dagger in his left sleeve and hurl it in the same motion, straight
for the Amyrlin&rsquo;s heart. If this thing had a heart. The second
knife came into his left hand smoothly and left more smoothly. The
two blades drifted through the air like thistledown. He wanted to
scream, but that first yell of shock and outrage still filled his
mouth. The Ruler of Rods was expanding beside the first two cards,
the Queen of Andor gripping the rod like a bludgeon, her red-gold
hair framing a madwoman&rsquo;s snarl.</p>

<p>He was still falling, still yelling that drawn-out
yell. The Amyrlin was free of her card, the High Lord striding out
with his sword. The flat shapes moved almost as slowly as he.
Almost. He had proof the steel in their hands could cut, and no
doubt the rod could crack a skull. His skull.</p>

<p>His thrown daggers moved as if sinking in jelly. He
was sure the cock had crowed for him. Whatever his father said, the
omen had been real. But he would not give up and die. Somehow he
had two more daggers out from under his coat, one in either hand.
Struggling to twist in midair, to get his feet under him, he threw
one knife at the golden-haired figure with the bludgeon. The other
he held on to as he tried to turn himself, to land ready to face&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The world lurched back into normal motion, and he
landed awkwardly on his side, hard enough to drive me wind out of
him. Desperately he struggled to his feet, drawing another knife
from under his coat. You could not carry too many, Thom claimed.
Neither was needed.</p>

<p>For a moment he thought cards and figures had
vanished. Or maybe he had imagined it all. Maybe he was the one
going mad. Then he saw the cards, back to ordinary size, pinned to
one of the dark wood panels by his still quivering knives. He took
a deep, ragged breath.</p>

<p>The table lay on its side, coins still spinning
across the floor where lordlings and servants crouched among
scattered cards. They gaped at Mat and his knives, those in his
hands and those in the wall, with equally wide eyes. Estean
snatched a silver pitcher that had somehow escaped being overturned
and began pouring wine down his throat, the excess spilling over
his chin and down his chest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just because you do not have the cards to win,&rdquo;
Edorion said hoarsely, &ldquo;there is no need to&mdash;&rdquo; He cut off with
a shudder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You saw it, too.&rdquo; Mat slipped the knives back into
their sheaths. A thin trickle of blood ran down the back of his
hand from the tiny wound. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pretend you went blind!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw nothing,&rdquo; Reimon said woodenly. &ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; He
began crawling across the floor, gathering up gold and silver,
concentrating on the coins as if they were the most important thing
in the world. The others were doing the same, except Estean, who
scrambled about checking the fallen pitchers for any that still
held wine. One of the servants had his face hidden in his hands;
the other, eyes closed, was apparently praying in a low, breathless
whine.</p>

<p>With a muttered oath, Mat strode to where his knives
pinned the three cards to the panel. They were only playing cards
again, just stiff paper with the clear lacquer cracked. But the
figure of the Amyrlin still held a dagger instead of a flame. He
tasted blood and realized he was sucking the cut in the back of his
hand.</p>

<p>Hastily he wrenched his knives free, tearing each
card in half before tucking the blade away. After a moment, he
hunted through the cards littering the floor until he found the
rulers of Coins and Winds, and tore them across, too. He felt a
little foolish&mdash;it was over and done with; the cards were
just cards again&mdash;but he could not help it.</p>

<p>None of the young lords crawling about on hands and
knees tried to stop him. They scrambled out of his way, not even
glancing at him. There would be no more gambling tonight, and maybe
not for some nights to come. At least, not with him. Whatever had
happened, it had been aimed at him, clearly. Even more clearly, it
had to have been done with the One Power. They wanted no part of
that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn you, Rand!&rdquo; he muttered under his breath. &ldquo;If
you have to go mad, leave me out of it!&rdquo; His pipe lay in two
pieces, the stem bitten through cleanly. Angrily he grabbed his
purse from the floor and stalked out of the room.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">In his darkened bedchamber Rand tossed uneasily on a
bed wide enough for five people. He was dreaming.</p>

<p>Through a shadowy forest Moiraine was prodding him
with a sharp stick toward where the Amyrlin Seat waited, sitting on
a stump with a rope halter for his neck in her hands. Dim shapes
moved half-seen through the trees, stalking, hunting him; here a
dagger blade flashed in the failing light, over there he caught a
glimpse of ropes ready for binding. Slender and not as tall as his
shoulder, Moiraine wore an expression he had never seen on her
face. Fear. Sweating, she prodded harder, trying to hurry him to
the Amyrlin&rsquo;s halter. Darkfriends and the Forsaken in the shadows,
the White Tower&rsquo;s leash ahead and Moiraine behind. Dodging
Moiraine&rsquo;s stick, he fled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is too late for that,&rdquo; she called after him, but
he had to get back. Back.</p>

<p>Muttering, he thrashed on the bed, then was still,
breathing more easily for a moment.</p>

<p>He was in the Waterwood back home, sunlight slanting
through the trees to sparkle on the pond in front of him. There was
green moss on the rocks at this end of the pond, and thirty paces
away at the other end a small arc of wildflowers. This was where,
as a child, he had learned to swim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have a swim now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spun around with a start. Min stood there,
grinning at him in her boy&rsquo;s coat and breeches, and next to her,
Elayne, with her red-golden curls, in a green silk gown fit for her
mother&rsquo;s palace.</p>

<p>It was Min who had spoken, but Elayne added, &ldquo;The
water looks inviting, Rand. No one will bother us here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he began slowly. Min cut him off by
twining her fingers behind his neck and pulling herself up on
tiptoe to kiss him.</p>

<p>She repeated Elayne&rsquo;s words in a soft murmur. &ldquo;No one
will bother us here.&rdquo; She stepped back and doffed her coat, then
attacked the laces of her shirt.</p>

<p>Rand stared, the more so when he realized Elayne&rsquo;s
gown was lying on the mossy ground. The Daughter-Heir was bending,
arms crossed, gathering up the hem of her shift.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; he demanded in a strangled
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Getting ready to go swimming with you,&rdquo; Min
replied.</p>

<p>Elayne flashed him a smile, and hoisted the shift
over her head.</p>

<p>He turned his back hastily, though half wanting not
to. And found himself staring at Egwene, her big, dark eyes looking
back at him sadly. Without a word she turned and vanished into the
trees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he shouted after her. &ldquo;I can explain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He began to run; he had to find her. But as he
reached the edge of trees, Min&rsquo;s voice stopped him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go, Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She and Elayne were in the water already, only their
heads showing as they swam lazily in the middle of the pond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come back,&rdquo; Elayne called, lifting a slim arm to
beckon. &ldquo;Do you not deserve what you want for a change?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shifted his feet, wanting to move but unable to
decide which way. What he wanted. The words sounded strange. What
did he want? He raised a hand to his face, to wipe away what felt
like sweat. Festering flesh almost obliterated the heron branded on
his palm; white bone showed through red-edged gaps.</p>

<p>With a jerk, he came awake, lying there shivering in
the dark heat. Sweat soaked his smallclothes, and the linen sheets
beneath his back. His side burned, where an old wound had never
healed properly. He traced the rough scar, a circle nearly an inch
across, still tender after all this time. Even Moiraine&rsquo;s Aes Sedai
Healing could not mend it completely. <em>But I&rsquo;m not rotting yet.
And I&rsquo;m not mad, either. Not yet</em>. Not yet. That said it all.
He wanted to laugh, and wondered if that meant he was a little mad
already.</p>

<p>Dreaming about Min and Elayne, dreaming of them like
that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Well, it was not madness, but it was surely
foolishness. Neither one of them had ever looked at him in that way
when he was awake. Egwene he had been all but promised to since
they were both children. The betrothal words had never been spoken
in front of the Women&rsquo;s Circle, but everyone in and around Emond&rsquo;s
Field knew they would marry one day.</p>

<p>That one day would never come, of course; not now,
not with the fate that lay ahead of a man who channeled. Egwene
must have realized that, too. She must have. She was all wrapped up
in becoming Aes Sedai. Still, women were odd; she might think she
could be an Aes Sedai and marry him anyway, channeling or no
channeling. How could he tell her that he did not want to marry her
anymore, that he loved her like a sister? But there would not be
any need to tell her, he was sure. He could hide behind what he
was. She had to understand that. What man could ask a woman to
marry him when he knew he had only a few years, if he was lucky,
before he went insane, before he began to rot alive? He shivered
despite the heat.</p>

<p><em>I need sleep</em>. The High Lords would be back
in the morning, maneuvering for his favor. For the Dragon Reborn&rsquo;s
favor. <em>Maybe I won&rsquo;t dream, this time</em>. He started to roll
over, searching for a dry place on the sheets&mdash;and froze,
listening to small rustlings in the darkness. He was not alone.</p>

<p>The Sword That Is Not a Sword lay across the room,
beyond his reach, on a throne-like stand the High Lords had given
him, no doubt in the hopes he would keep <em>Callandor</em> out of
their sight. <em>Someone wanting to steal</em> Callandor. A second
thought came. <em>Or to kill the Dragon Reborn</em>. He did not
need Thom&rsquo;s whispered warnings to know that the High Lord&rsquo;s
professions of undying loyalty were only words of necessity.</p>

<p>He emptied himself of thought and emotions, assuming
the Void; that much came without effort. Floating in the cold
emptiness within himself, thought and emotion outside, he reached
for the True Source. This time he touched it easily, which was not
always the case.</p>

<p><em>Saidin</em> filled him like a torrent of white
heat and light, exalting him with life, sickening him with the
foulness of the Dark One&rsquo;s taint, like a skim of sewage floating on
pure, sweet water. The torrent threatened to wash him away, burn
him up, engulf him.</p>

<p>Fighting the flood, he mastered it by bare effort of
will and rolled from the bed, channeling the Power as he landed on
his feet in the stance to begin the sword-form called Apple
Blossoms in the Wind. His enemies could not be many or they would
have made more noise; the gently named form was meant for use
against more than one opponent.</p>

<p>As his feet hit the carpet, a sword was in his hands,
with a long hilt and a slightly curved blade sharp on only one
edge. It looked to have been wrought from flame yet it did not feel
even warm. The figure of a heron stood black against the yellow-red
of the blade. In the same instant every candle and gilded lamp
burst alight, small mirrors behind them swelling the illumination.
Larger mirrors on the walls and two stand-mirrors reflected it
further, until he could have read comfortably anywhere in the large
room.</p>

<p><em>Callandor</em> sat undisturbed, a sword seemingly
of glass, hilt and blade, on a stand as tall as a man and just as
wide, the wood ornately carved and gilded and set with precious
stones. The furnishings, too, were all gilded and begemmed, bed and
chairs and benches, wardrobes and chests and washstand. The pitcher
and bowl were golden Sea Folk porcelain, as thin as leaves. The
broad Tarabon carpet, in scrolls of scarlet and gold and blue,
could have fed an entire village for months. Almost every flat
surface held more delicate Sea Folk porcelain, or else goblets and
bowls and ornaments of gold worked with silver, and silver chased
with gold. On the broad marble mantel over the fireplace, two
silver wolves with ruby eyes tried to pull down a golden stag a
good three feet tall. Draperies of scarlet silk embroidered with
eagles in thread-of-gold hung at the narrow windows, stirring
slightly in a failing wind. Books lay wherever there was room,
leather-bound, wood-bound, some tattered and still dusty from the
deepest shelves of the Stone&rsquo;s library.</p>

<p>Now, where he had thought to see assassins, or
thieves, one beautiful young woman stood hesitant and surprised in
the middle of the carpet, black hair falling in shining waves to
her shoulders. Her thin, white silk robe emphasized more than it
hid. Berelain, ruler of the city-state of Mayene, was the last
person he had expected.</p>

<p>After one wide-eyed start, she made a deep, graceful
curtsy that drew her garments tight. &ldquo;I am unarmed, my Lord Dragon.
I submit myself to your search, if you doubt me.&rdquo; Her smile
suddenly made him uncomfortably aware that he wore nothing but his
smallclothes.</p>

<p><em>I&rsquo;ll be burned if she makes me scramble around
trying to cover myself</em>. The thought floated beyond the Void.
<em>I didn&rsquo;t ask her to walk in on me. To</em> sneak <em>in!</em>
Anger and embarrassment drifted along the borders of emptiness too,
but his face reddened all the same; dimly he was aware of it, aware
of the knowledge deepening the flush in his cheeks. So coldly calm
within the Void; outside&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He could feel each individual
droplet of sweat sliding down his chest and back. It took a real
effort of stubborn will to stand there under her eyes. <em>Search
her? The Light help me!</em></p>

<p>Relaxing his stance, he let the sword vanish but held
the narrow flow connecting him to <em>saidin</em>. It was like
drinking from a hole in a dike when the whole long mound of earth
wanted to give way, the water sweet as honeyed wine and sickening
as a rivulet through a midden.</p>

<p>He did not know much of this woman, except that she
walked through the Stone as if it were her palace in Mayene. Thom
said the First of Mayene asked questions constantly, of everyone.
Questions about Rand. Which might have been natural, given what he
was, but they made him no easier in his mind. And she had not
returned to Mayene. That was not natural. She had been held captive
in all but name for months, until his arrival, cut off from her
throne and the ruling of her small nation. Most people would have
taken the first opportunity to get away from a man who could
channel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; He knew he sounded harsh,
and did not care. &ldquo;There were Aiel guarding that door when I went
to sleep. How did you come past them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Berelain&rsquo;s lips curved up a trifle more; to Rand it
seemed the room had gotten suddenly even hotter. &ldquo;They passed me
through immediately, when I said I had been summoned by the Lord
Dragon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Summoned? I didn&rsquo;t summon anybody.&rdquo; <em>Stop
this</em>, he told himself. <em>She&rsquo;s a queen, or the next thing to
it. You know as much about the ways of queens as you do about
flying</em>. He tried to make himself be civil, only he did not
know what to call the First of Mayene. &ldquo;My Lady&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; That would
have to do. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;why would I summon you at this time of
night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave a low, rich laugh, deep in her throat; even
wrapped in emotionless emptiness it seemed to tickle his skin, make
the hairs stir on his arms and legs. Suddenly he took in her
clinging garb as if for the first time, and felt himself go red all
over again. <em>She can&rsquo;t mean</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Can she? Light, I&rsquo;ve
never said two words to her before</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I wish to talk, my Lord Dragon.&rdquo; She let the
pale robe fall to the floor, revealing an even thinner white silk
garment he could only call a nightgown. It left her smooth
shoulders completely bare, and exposed a considerable expanse of
pale bosom. He found himself wondering distantly what held it up.
It was difficult not to stare. &ldquo;You are a long way from your home,
like me. The nights especially seem lonely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow, I will be happy to talk with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But during the day, people surround you.
Petitioners. High Lords. Aiel.&rdquo; She gave a shiver; he told himself
he really ought to look away, but he could as easily have stopped
breathing. He had never before been so aware of his own reactions
when wrapped in the Void. &ldquo;The Aiel frighten me, and I do not like
Tairen lords of any sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About the Tairens he could believe her, but he did
not think anything frightened this woman. <em>Burn me, she&rsquo;s in a
strange man&rsquo;s bedchamber in the middle of the night, only
half-dressed, and I&rsquo;m the one who&rsquo;s jumpy as a cat in a dog run,
Void or no</em>. It was time to put an end to things before they
went too far.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be better if you return to your own
bedchamber, my Lady.&rdquo; Part of him wanted to tell her to put on a
cloak, too. A thick cloak. Part of him did. &ldquo;It&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;it is really
too late for talking. Tomorrow. In daylight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave him a slanted, quizzical look. &ldquo;Have you
absorbed stuffy Tairen ways already, my Lord Dragon? Or is this
reticence something from your Two Rivers? We are not so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;formal&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;in Mayene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lady&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He tried to sound formal; if she did
not like formality, that was what he wanted. &ldquo;I am promised to
Egwene al&rsquo;Vere, my Lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean the Aes Sedai, my Lord Dragon? If she
really is Aes Sedai. She is quite young&mdash;perhaps too young&mdash;to wear
the ring and the shawl.&rdquo; Berelain spoke as if Egwene were a child,
though she herself could not be more than a year older than Rand,
if that, and he had only a little over two years on Egwene. &ldquo;My
Lord Dragon, I do not mean to come between you. Marry her, if she
is Green Ajah. I would never aspire to wed the Dragon Reborn
himself. Forgive me if I overstep myself, but I told you we are not
so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;formal in Mayene. May I call you Rand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand surprised himself by sighing regretfully. There
had been a glint in her eye, a slight shift of expression, gone
quickly, when she mentioned marrying the Dragon Reborn. If she had
not considered it before, she had now. The Dragon Reborn, not Rand
al&rsquo;Thor; the man of prophecy, not the shepherd from the Two Rivers.
He was not shocked, exactly; some girls back home mooned over
whoever proved himself fastest or strongest in the games at Bel
Tine and Sunday, and now and again a woman set her eyes on the man
with the richest fields or the largest flocks. It would have been
good to think she wanted Rand al&rsquo;Thor. &ldquo;It is time for you to go,
my Lady,&rdquo; he said quietly.</p>

<p>She stepped closer. &ldquo;I can feel your eyes on me,
Rand.&rdquo; Her voice was smoky heat. &ldquo;I am no village girl tied to her
mother&rsquo;s apron, and I know you want&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m made of stone, woman?&rdquo; She jumped
at his roar, but the next instant she was crossing the carpet,
reaching for him, her eyes dark pools that could pull a man into
their depths.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your arms look as strong as stone. If you think you
must be harsh with me, then be harsh, so long as you hold me.&rdquo; Her
hands touched his face; sparks seemed to leap from her fingers.</p>

<p>Without thinking he channeled the flows still linked
to him, and suddenly she was staggering back, eyes wide with
startlement, as if a wall of air pushed her. It <em>was</em> air, he
realized; he did things without knowing what he was doing more
often than he did know. At least, once done, he could usually
remember how to do them again.</p>

<p>The unseen, moving wall scraped ripples along the
carpet, sweeping along Berelain&rsquo;s discarded robe, a boot he had
tossed aside undressing, and a red leather footstool supporting an
open volume of Eban Vandes&rsquo;s <em>The History of the Stone of
Tear</em>, pushing them along as it forced her almost to the wall,
fenced her in. Safely away from him. He tied off the flow&mdash;that was all he could think to call what he did&mdash;and no
longer needed to maintain the shield himself. For a moment he
studied what he had done, until he was sure he could repeat it. It
looked useful, especially the tying off.</p>

<p>Dark eyes still wide, Berelain felt along the
confines of her invisible prison with trembling hands. Her face was
almost as white as her skimpy silk shift. Footstool, boot and book
lay at her feet, jumbled with the robe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much as I regret it,&rdquo; he told her, &ldquo;we will not
speak again, except in public, my Lady.&rdquo; He really did regret it.
Whatever her motives, she was beautiful. <em>Burn me, I</em> am
<em>a fool</em>. He was not sure how he meant that&mdash;for
thinking of her beauty, or for sending her away. &ldquo;In fact, it is
best you arrange your journey back to Mayene as soon as possible. I
promise you that Tear will not trouble Mayene again. You have my
word.&rdquo; It was a promise good only for his lifetime, perhaps only as
long as he stood in the Stone, but he had to offer her something. A
bandage for wounded pride, a gift to take her mind off being
afraid.</p>

<p>But her fear was already under control, on the
outside, at least. Honesty and openness filled her face, all
efforts at allure gone. &ldquo;Forgive me. I have handled this badly. I
did not mean to offend. In my country, a woman may speak her mind
to a man freely, or he to her. Rand, you must know that you are a
handsome man, tall and strong. I would be the one made of stone, if
I did not see it, and admire. Please do not send me away from you.
I will beg it, if you wish.&rdquo; She knelt smoothly, like a dance. Her
expression still said she was being open, confessing everything,
but on the other hand, in kneeling she had managed to tug her
already precarious gown down until it looked in real danger of
falling off. &ldquo;Please, Rand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even sheltered in emptiness as he was, he gaped at
her, and it had nothing to do with her beauty or her near undress.
Well, only partly. If the Defenders of the Stone had been half as
determined as this woman, half as steadfast in purpose, ten
thousand Aiel could never have taken the Stone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am flattered, my Lady,&rdquo; he said diplomatically.
&ldquo;Believe me, I am. But it would not be fair to you. I cannot give
you what you deserve.&rdquo; <em>And let her make of that what she
will</em>.</p>

<p>Outside in the darkness, a cock crowed.</p>

<p>To Rand&rsquo;s surprise, Berelain suddenly stared past
him, eyes as big as teacups. Her mouth dropped open, and her slim
throat corded with a scream that would not come. He spun, the
yellow-red sword flashing back into his hands.</p>

<p>Across the room, one of the stand-mirrors threw his
reflection back at him, a tall young man with reddish hair and gray
eyes, wearing only white linen smallclothes and holding a sword
carved from fire. The reflection stepped out onto the carpet,
raising its sword.</p>

<p><em>I</em> have <em>gone mad</em>. Thought drifted on
the borders of the Void. <em>No! She saw it. It&rsquo;s real!</em></p>

<p>Movement to his left caught the corner of his eye. He
twisted before he could think, sword sweeping up in The Moon Rises
Over Water. The blade slashed through the shape&mdash;his shape&mdash;climbing out of a mirror on the wall. The form wavered,
broke up like dust motes floating on air, vanished. Rand&rsquo;s
reflection appeared in the mirror again, but even as it did, it put
hands on the mirror frame. He was aware of movement in mirrors all
around the room.</p>

<p>Desperately, he stabbed at the mirror. Silvered glass
shattered, yet it seemed that the image shattered first. He thought
he heard a distant scream inside his head, his own voice screaming,
fading. Even as shards of mirror fell, he lashed out with the One
Power. Every mirror in the room exploded silently, fountaining
glass across the carpet. The dying scream in his head echoed again
and again, sending shivers down his back. It was his voice; he
could hardly believe it was not himself who made the sounds.</p>

<p>He spun back to face the one that had gotten out,
just in time to meet its attack, Unfolding the Fan to counter
Stones Falling Down the Mountain. The figure leaped back, and
suddenly Rand realized it was not alone. As quickly as he had
smashed the mirrors, two more reflections had escaped. Now they
stood facing him, three duplicates of himself down to the puckered
round scar on his side, all staring at him, faces twisted with
hatred and contempt, with a strange hunger. Only their eyes seemed
empty, lifeless. Before he could take a breath, they rushed at
him.</p>

<p>Rand stepped sideways, pieces of broken mirror
slicing his feet, ever sideways, from stance to stance and form to
form, trying to face only one at a time. He used everything Lan,
Moiraine&rsquo;s Warder, had taught him of the sword in their daily
practice.</p>

<p>Had the three fought together, had they supported one
another, he would have died in the first minute, but each fought
him alone, as if the others did not exist. Even so, he could not
stop their blades entirely; in minutes blood ran down the side of
his face, his chest, his arms. The old wound tore open, adding its
flow to stain his smallclothes with red. They had his skill as well
as his face, and they were three to his one. Chairs and tables
toppled; priceless Sea Folk porcelain shattered on the carpet.</p>

<p>He felt his strength ebbing. None of his cuts was
major by itself, except the old wound, but all together&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He
never thought of calling for help from the Aiel outside his door.
The thick walls would stifle even a death scream. Whatever was
done, he must do alone. He fought wrapped in the cold
emotionlessness of the Void, but fear scraped at its boundaries
like wind-lashed branches scratching a window in the night.</p>

<p>His blade slipped past its opponent to slash across a
face just below the eyes&mdash;he could not help wincing; it was
<em>his</em> face&mdash;its owner sliding back just far enough to avoid a
killing cut. Blood welled from the gash, veiling mouth and chin in
dark crimson, but the ruined face did not change expression, and
its empty eyes never flickered. It wanted him dead the way a
starving man wanted food.</p>

<p><em>Can anything kill them?</em> All three bled from
the wounds he had managed to inflict, but bleeding did not seem to
slow them as he knew it was slowing him. They tried to avoid his
sword, but did not appear to realize they had been hurt. <em>If
they have been</em>, he thought grimly. <em>Light, if they bleed,
they can be hurt! They must!</em></p>

<p>He needed a respite, a moment to catch his breath, to
gather himself. Suddenly he leaped away from them, onto the bed,
rolling across its width. He sensed rather than saw blades slashing
the sheets, barely missing his flesh. Staggering, he landed on his
feet, caught at a small table to steady himself. The shining,
gold-worked silver bowl on the table wobbled. One of his doubles
had climbed onto the torn bed, kicking goose feathers as it padded
across warily, sword at the ready. The other two came slowly
around, still ignoring each other, intent only on him. Their eyes
glistened like glass.</p>

<p>Rand shuddered as pain stabbed his hand on the table.
An image of himself, no more than six inches tall, drew back its
small sword. Instinctively, he grabbed the figure before it could
stab again. It writhed in his grip, baring teeth at him. He became
aware of small movements all around the room, of small reflections
by the score stepping out of polished silver. His hand began to
numb, to grow cold, as if the thing were sucking the warmth out of
his flesh. The heat of <em>saidin</em> swelled inside him; a
rushing filled his head, and the heat flowed into his icy hand.</p>

<p>Suddenly the small figure burst like a bubble, and he
felt something flow into him&mdash;from the bursting&mdash;some
little portion of his lost strength. He jerked as tiny jolts of
vitality seemed to pelt him.</p>

<p>When he raised his head&mdash;wondering why he was
not dead&mdash;the small reflections he had half-glimpsed were
gone. The three larger stood wavering, as if his gain in strength
had been their loss. Yet as he looked up, they steadied on their
feet and came on, if more cautiously.</p>

<p>He backed away, thinking furiously, sword threatening
first one and then another. If he continued to fight them as he had
been, they would kill him sooner or later. He knew that as surely
as he knew he was bleeding. But something linked the reflections.
Absorbing the small one&mdash;the far-off thought made him queasy,
but that was what it had been&mdash;had not only brought the
others with it, it had also affected the bigger, for a moment at
least. If he could do the same to one of them, it might destroy all
three.</p>

<p>Even thinking of absorbing them made him vaguely
aware of wanting to empty his stomach, but he did not know another
way. <em>I don&rsquo;t know</em> this <em>way. How did I do it? Light, what did I
do?</em> He had to grapple with one of them, to touch it at least;
he was somehow sure of that. But if he tried to get that close, he
would have three blades through him in as many heartbeats. <em>
Reflections. How much are they still reflections?</em></p>

<p>Hoping he was not being a fool&mdash;if he was, he
might well be a dead one&mdash;he let his sword vanish. He was
ready to bring it back on the instant, but when his carved-fire
blade winked out of existence, the others&rsquo; did, too. For a moment,
confusion painted three copies of his face, one a bloody ruin. But
before he could seize one of them, they leaped for him, all four
crashing to the floor in a tangle of grappling limbs, rolling
across the glass-littered carpet.</p>

<p>Cold soaked into Rand. Numbness crept along his
limbs, through his bones, until he barely felt the shards of
mirror, the slivers of porcelain grinding into his flesh. Something
close to panic flickered across the emptiness surrounding him. He
might have made a fatal mistake. They were larger than the one he
had absorbed, and they were drawing more heat from him. And not
only heat. As he grew colder, the glassy gray eyes staring into his
took on life. With chill certainty he knew that if he died, that
would not end the struggle. The three would turn on one another
until only one remained, and that one would have his life, his
memories, would <em>be</em> him.</p>

<p>Stubbornly he fought, struggling harder the weaker he
became. He pulled on <em>saidin</em>, trying to fill himself with
its heat. Even the stomach-turning taint was welcome, for the more
of it he felt, the more <em>saidin</em> suffused him. If his
stomach could rebel, then he was still alive, and if he lived, he
could fight. <em>But how? How? What did I do before? Saidin</em>
raged through him till it seemed that if he survived his attackers,
he would only be consumed by the Power. <em>How did I do it?</em>
All he could do was pull at <em>saidin</em>, and try&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;reach .
. . strain&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the three vanished&mdash;Rand felt it slide
into him; it was as if he had fallen from a height, flat onto stony
ground&mdash;and then the other two together. The impact flung him
onto his back, where he lay staring up at the worked plaster
ceiling with its gilded bosses, lay luxuriating in the fact that he
was still breathing.</p>

<p>The Power still swelled in every crevice of his
being. He wanted to spew up every meal he had ever eaten. He felt
so alive that, by comparison, life not soaked in <em>saidin</em>
was living a shadow. He could smell the beeswax of the candles, and
the oil in the lamps. He could feel every fiber of the carpet
against his back. He could feel every gash in his flesh, every cut,
every nick, every bruise. But he held on to <em>saidin</em>.</p>

<p>One of the Forsaken had tried to kill him. Or all of
them had. It must have been that, unless the Dark One was free
already, in which case he did not think he would have faced
anything as easy or as simple as this. So he held his link to the
True Source. <em>Unless I did it myself. Can I hate what I am
enough to try to kill myself? Without even knowing it? Light, I
have to learn to control it. I have to!</em></p>

<p>Painfully, he pushed himself up. Leaving bloody
footprints on the carpet, he limped to the stand where <em>
Callandor</em> rested. Blood from hundreds of cuts covered him. He
lifted the sword, and its glassy length glowed with the Power
flowing into it. The Sword That Is Not a Sword. That blade,
apparently glass, would cut as well as the finest steel, yet <em>
Callandor</em> truly was not a sword, but instead a remnant of the
Age of Legends, a <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>. With the aid of one of the
relatively few <em>angreal</em> known to have survived the War of
the Shadow and Breaking of the World, it was possible to channel
flows of the One Power that would have burned the channeler to ash
without it. With one of the even rarer <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>, the
flows could be increased as much over those possible with an <em>
angreal</em> as an <em>angreal</em> increased them over channeling
naked. And <em>Callandor</em>, usable only by a man, linked to the
Dragon Reborn through three thousand years of legend and prophecy,
was one of the most powerful <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em> ever made. Holding
<em>Callandor</em> in his hands, he could level a city&rsquo;s walls at a
blow. Holding <em>Callandor</em> in his hands, he could face even
one of the Forsaken. <em>It</em> was <em>them. It must have
been</em>.</p>

<p>Abruptly he realized he had not heard a sound from
Berelain. Half fearing to see her dead, he turned.</p>

<p>Still kneeling, she flinched. She had donned her robe
again, and hugged it around her like steel armor, or stone walls.
Face as white as snow, she licked her lips. &ldquo;Which one are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo;
She swallowed and began again. &ldquo;Which one&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; She could not
finish it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the only one there is,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;The
one you were treating as if we were betrothed.&rdquo; He meant it to
soothe her, perhaps make her smile&mdash;surely a woman as strong
as she had shown herself to be could smile, even facing a
blood-drenched man&mdash;but she bent forward, pressing her face
to the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I apologize humbly for having most grievously
offended you, Lord Dragon.&rdquo; Her breathy voice did sound humble, and
frightened. Completely unlike herself. &ldquo;I beg you to forget my
offense, and forgive. I will not bother you again. I swear it, my
Lord Dragon. On my mother&rsquo;s name and under the Light, I swear
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He loosed the knotted flow; the invisible wall
confining her became a momentary stir that ruffled her robe. &ldquo;There
is nothing to forgive,&rdquo; he said wearily. He felt very tired. &ldquo;Go as
you wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She straightened hesitantly, stretched out a hand,
and gave a relieved gasp when it encountered nothing. Gathering the
skirts of her robe, she began to pick her way across the
glass-littered carpet, shards grating under her velvet slippers.
Short of the door, she stopped, facing him with an obvious effort.
Her eyes could not quite meet his. &ldquo;I will send the Aiel in to you,
if you wish. I could send for one of the Aes Sedai to tend your
wounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>She would as soon be in a room with a Myrddraal,
now, or the Dark One himself, but she&rsquo;s no milksop</em>. &ldquo;Thank
you,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;but no. I would appreciate it if you told
no one what happened here. Not yet. I will do what needs to be
done.&rdquo; <em>It</em> had <em>to be the Forsaken</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As my Lord Dragon commands.&rdquo; She gave him a tight
curtsy and hurried out, perhaps afraid he might change his mind
about letting her go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As soon the Dark One himself,&rdquo; he murmured as the
door closed behind her.</p>

<p>Limping to the foot of the bed, he lowered himself
into the chest there and laid <em>Callandor</em> across his knees,
bloody hands resting on the glowing blade. With that in his hands,
even one of the Forsaken would fear him. In a moment he would send
for Moiraine to Heal his wounds. In a moment he would speak to the
Aiel outside, and become the Dragon Reborn again. But for now, he
only wanted to sit, and remember a shepherd named Rand al&rsquo;Thor.</p>
