<h4><em>A Breaking in the Three-fold Land</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
molten afternoon sun broiled the Waste, flinging
shadows across the mountains to the north, just ahead now. The dry
hills passed beneath Jeade&rsquo;en&rsquo;s hooves, high and low like swells in
an ocean of cracked clay, miles rolling away behind. The mountains
had held Rand&rsquo;s eyes since they first came in sight the day before,
not snowcapped, not so tall as the Mountains of Mist, much less the
Spine of the World, but jagged slabs of brown and gray stone,
streaked in some places with yellow or red or bands of glittering
flecks, tumbled about so that a man might think to try the
Dragonwall afoot first. Sighing, he settled in his saddle and
adjusted the <em>shoufa</em> he wore with his red coat. In those
mountains lay Alcair Dal. Soon there would be an ending of sorts,
or a beginning. Maybe both. Soon, perhaps.</p>

<p>Yellow-haired Adelin strode easily ahead of the
dapple stallion, and nine more sun-dark <em>Far Dareis Mai</em>
made a wide ring around him, all with bucklers and spears in hand,
cased bows on their backs, black veils dangling on their chests
ready to be lifted. Rand&rsquo;s honor guard. The Aiel did not call it
that, yet the Maidens came to Alcair Dal for Rand&rsquo;s honor. So many
differences, and he did not know what half really were even when he
saw them.</p>

<p>For instance, Aviendha&rsquo;s behavior toward the Maidens,
and theirs to her. Most of the time, as now, she walked beside his
horse with her arms folded in the shawl around her shoulders; green
eyes intent beneath her dark head scarf on the mountains ahead, she
seldom spoke with the Maidens beyond a word or two, but that was
not the oddity. Her arms folded; that was the heart of it. The
Maidens knew she wore the ivory bracelet, yet seemed to pretend not
to see it; she would not take it off, yet hid her wrist whenever
she thought one of them might be looking.</p>

<p><em>You have no society</em>, Adelin had told him
when he suggested some other than the Maidens of the Spear might
provide his escort. Each chief, whether of clan or sept, would be
accompanied by men from the society he had belonged to before
becoming chief. <em>You have no society, but your mother was a
Maiden</em>. The yellow-haired woman and the other nine had not
looked at Aviendha, a few steps away in the entry hall to Lian&rsquo;s
roof; they had <em>not</em> looked intently. <em>For countless
years Maidens who would not give up the spear have given their
babes for the Wise Ones to hand to other women, none knowing where
the child went or even whether boy or girl. Now a Maiden&rsquo;s son has
come back to us, and we know him. We will go to Alcair Dal for your
honor, son of Shaiel, a Maiden of the Chumai Taardad</em>. Her face
was so set&mdash;all of their faces were, including Aviendha&rsquo;s&mdash;that he thought they might offer to dance the spears if he
refused.</p>

<p>When he accepted, they made him go through that
ritual of &ldquo;Remember honor&rdquo; again, this time with some drink called
<em>oosquai</em>, made from <em>zemai</em>, drinking to the bottom
of a small silver cup with each of them. Ten Maidens; ten little
cups. The stuff looked like faintly brown-tinged water, tasted
almost like it&mdash;and was stronger than double-distilled
brandy. He had not been able to walk straight after, and they had
got him to bed, laughing at him, no matter how he protested, as
much as he could with all of them tickling him so he could barely
breathe for laughing himself. All but Aviendha. Not that she went
away; she stayed and watched the whole thing with a face as blank
as stone. When Adelin and the others finally tucked him into his
blankets and left, Aviendha sat down beside the door, spreading her
dark, heavy skirts, watching him stonily until he fell asleep. At
his waking, she was still there, still watching. And refusing to
talk about Maidens or <em>oosquai</em> or any of it; as far as she
was concerned, it seemed not to have happened. Whether the Maidens
would have been as reticent, he did not know; how could you
possibly look ten women in the face and ask why they had gotten you
drunk and made a game of taking your clothes off and putting you to
bed?</p>

<p>So many differences, so few that made much sense that
he could see, and no telling which might trip him up and ruin all
his plans. Yet he could not afford to wait. He glanced over his
shoulder. What was done, was done. <em>And who can say what&rsquo;s yet
to come?</em></p>

<p>Well behind, the Taardad followed him. Not just the
Nine Valley Taardad and the Jindo, but the Miadi and the Four
Stones, the Chumai and the Bloody Water and more, broad columns
surrounding the peddlers&rsquo; lurching wagons and the Wise Ones&rsquo; party,
reaching back two miles through the shimmering heat haze, ringed by
scouts and outrunners. Every day more had come in response to the
runners Rhuarc had sent that first day, a hundred men and Maidens
here, three hundred there, five hundred, according to the size of
each sept and what each hold needed to keep for safety.</p>

<p>In the distance to the south and west, another band
was approaching at a run, trailing dust for their pace; perhaps
they belonged to some other clan on its way to Alcair Dal, but he
thought not. Only two-thirds of the septs represented yet, but he
estimated there were well over fifteen thousand Taardad Aiel strung
out behind him. An army on the march, and still growing. Nearly an
entire clan coming to a meeting of chiefs, in violation of all
custom.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jeade&rsquo;en topped a rise, and there in a long,
wide hollow below was the fair gathered for the meeting, and on the
hills beyond, the camps of the clan and sept chiefs who had already
arrived.</p>

<p>Spread among two or three hundred of the low,
wall-less tents, all widely spaced, were pavilions of the same
grayish brown material that were tall enough to stand beneath, with
goods displayed on blankets in the shade, brightly glazed pottery
and even brighter rugs, jewelry in silver or gold. Aiel crafts
mainly, but there would be things from beyond the Waste as well,
including perhaps silk and ivory from far to the east. No one
seemed to be trading; the few men and women in sight sat in one or
another of the pavilions, usually alone.</p>

<p>Of the five camps scattered on heights around the
fair, four looked just as empty, only a few dozen men or Maidens
stirring amid tents set up for as many as a thousand. The fifth
camp sprawled over twice as much ground as any of the others, with
hundreds of people visible, and likely as many more inside the
tents.</p>

<p>Rhuarc trotted up the hill behind Rand with his ten
<em>Aethan Dor</em>, Red Shields, followed by Heirn with ten
<em>Tain Shari</em>, True Bloods, and forty-odd more sept chiefs
with their escorts for honor, all with spears and bucklers, bows
and quivers. It made a formidable force, more than had taken the
Stone of Tear. Some of the Aiel in the camps and among the
pavilions were peering at the hilltop. Not at the Aiel gathered
there, Rand suspected. At him; a man on a horse. A thing seen very
seldom in the Three-fold Land. He would show them more before he
was done.</p>

<p>Rhuarc&rsquo;s gaze settled on the largest camp, where more
Aiel in <em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em> were boiling out of the tents, all to
stare in their direction. &ldquo;Shaido, unless I mistake myself,&rdquo; he
said quietly. &ldquo;Couladin. You are not the only one to break custom,
Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps as well I did.&rdquo; Rand dragged the
<em>shoufa</em> from around his head and stuffed it into his coat
pocket atop the <em>angreal</em>, the carving of a round-faced man
with a sword across his knees. The sun began baking his bare head
to show him how much protection the cloth had been. &ldquo;If we had come
according to custom&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; The Shaido were loping toward the
mountains, leaving behind apparently empty tents. And causing some
little stir in the other camps, and the fair; the Aiel gave over
staring at a man on a horse to peer after the Shaido. &ldquo;Could you
have forced a way into Alcair Dal against two-to-one odds or
better, Rhuarc?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not before nightfall,&rdquo; the clan chief replied
slowly, &ldquo;not even against Shaido dogrobbers. This is more than
violation of custom! Even Shaido should have more honor than
this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Angry mutters of agreement rose from the other
Taardad on the hilltop. Except the Maidens; for some reason they
had gathered around Aviendha off to one side, talking seriously
among themselves. Rhuarc spoke a few quiet words to one of his Red
Shields, a green-eyed fellow who looked as if his face had been
used to pound fence posts, and the man turned downhill, running
swiftly back toward the approaching Taardad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you expect this?&rdquo; Rhuarc asked Rand as soon as
the Red Shield left. &ldquo;Is that why you summoned the entire
clan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not this exactly, Rhuarc.&rdquo; The Shaido began forming
lines before a narrow gap into the mountains; they were veiling
themselves. &ldquo;But there was no other reason for Couladin to leave in
the night except that he was eager to be somewhere, and where would
he better like to be than here, causing me trouble? Are the others
already in Alcair Dal? Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The opportunity presented by chiefs meeting is not
to be missed, Rand al&rsquo;Thor. There will be discussions of boundary
disputes, grazing rights, a dozen things. Water. If two Aiel from
different clans meet, they discuss water. Three from three clans,
and they discuss water and grazing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And four?&rdquo; Rand asked. Five clans represented
already, and the Taardad made six.</p>

<p>Rhuarc hesitated a moment, hefting one of his short
spears unconsciously. &ldquo;Four will dance the spears. But it should
not be so here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Taardad parted to let the Wise Ones through,
shawls over their heads, with Moiraine and Lan and Egwene riding
behind. Egwene and the Aes Sedai wore those white cloths around
their temples, in damp imitation of the Aiel women&rsquo;s head scarves.
Mat rode up, too, off by himself, black-hafted spear across his
pommel. His wide-brimmed hat shadowed his face as he studied what
lay ahead.</p>

<p>The Warder nodded to himself when he saw the Shaido.
&ldquo;That could be messy,&rdquo; he said softly. His black stallion rolled an
eye at Rand&rsquo;s dapple; only that, and Lan was intent on the Aiel
ranks before the gap, yet he patted Mandarb&rsquo;s neck soothingly. &ldquo;But
not now, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; Rhuarc agreed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If only you would&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>allow</em> me to go in
with you.&rdquo; Except for that one slight hitch, Moiraine&rsquo;s voice was
as serene as ever; cool calm painted her ageless features, but her
dark eyes looked at Rand as if her gaze alone could force him to
relent.</p>

<p>Amys&rsquo;s long pale hair, hanging below her shawl, swung
as she shook her head firmly. &ldquo;It is not his decision, Aes Sedai.
This is the business of chiefs, men&rsquo;s business. If we let you go
into Alcair Dal now, the next time Wise Ones meet, or
roofmistresses, some clan chief will want to put his nose in. They
think we meddle in their affairs, and often try to meddle in ours.&rdquo;
She gave Rhuarc a quick smile meant to convey that she did not
include him; her husband&rsquo;s lack of expression told Rand he thought
otherwise.</p>

<p>Melaine gripped her shawl under her chin, precisely
staring at Rand. If she did not agree with Moraine, at least she
mistrusted what he would do. He had hardly slept since leaving Cold
Rocks; if they had peered into his dreams, they had seen only
nightmares.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be careful, Rand al&rsquo;Thor,&rdquo; Bair said as if she had
read his thoughts. &ldquo;A tired man makes mistakes. You cannot afford
mistakes today.&rdquo; She pulled her shawl down around her thin
shoulders, and her thin voice took on an almost angry note.
&ldquo;<em>We</em> cannot afford for you to make mistakes. The Aiel
cannot afford it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The coming of more riders to the hilltop had drawn
eyes back to them. Among the pavilions several hundred Aiel, men in
<em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em> and long-haired women in skirts and blouses and
shawls, made a watchful crowd. Its attention shifted when Kadere&rsquo;s
dusty white wagon appeared behind its team of mules off to the
right, with the heavy, cream-coated peddler on the driver&rsquo;s seat,
and Isendre all in white silk holding a matching parasol. Keille&rsquo;s
wagon followed, with Natael handling the reins at her side, and the
canvas-topped wagons, and finally the three big water wagons like
huge barrels on wheels with their long mule teams. They looked at
Rand as the wagons rambled past in a squeal of ungreased axles,
Kadere and Isendre, Natael in his gleeman&rsquo;s patch-covered cloak,
Keille&rsquo;s great bulk encased in snowy white, a white lace shawl on
her ivory combs. Rand patted Jeade&rsquo;en&rsquo;s arched neck. Men and women
began spilling out of the fair below to meet the approaching
wagons. The Shaido were waiting. Soon, now.</p>

<p>Egwene moved her gray close to Jeade&rsquo;en; the dapple
stallion tried to nuzzle Mist and got nipped for his trouble.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve not given me any chance to speak to you since Cold Rocks,
Rand.&rdquo; He said nothing; she was Aes Sedai now, and not just because
she called herself one. He wondered if she had spied on his dreams,
too. Her face looked tight, her dark eyes tired. &ldquo;Do not keep to
yourself, Rand. You do not fight alone. Others do battle for you,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frowning, he tried not to look at her. His first
thought was of Emond&rsquo;s Field and Perrin, but he did not see how she
could know where Perrin had gone. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he said
finally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fight for you,&rdquo; Moiraine said before Egwene could
open her mouth, &ldquo;as does Egwene.&rdquo; A look flashed between the two
women. &ldquo;People fight for you who do not know it, any more than you
know them. You do not realize what it means that you force the form
of the Age Lace, do you? The ripples of your actions, the ripples
of your very existence, spread across the Pattern to change the
weave of life-threads of which you will never be aware. The battle
is far from yours alone. Yet you stand in the heart of this web in
the Pattern. Should you fail, and fall, all fails and falls. Since
I cannot go with you into Alcair Dal, let Lan accompany you. One
more pair of eyes to watch your back.&rdquo; The Warder turned slightly
in his saddle, frowning at her; with the Shaido veiled for killing,
he would not be eager to leave her alone.</p>

<p>Rand did not think he was supposed to have seen that
look pass from Moiraine to Egwene. So they had a secret to keep
from him. Egwene <em>did</em> have Aes Sedai eyes, dark and
unreadable. Aviendha and the Maidens had come back to him. &ldquo;Let Lan
stay with you, Moiraine. <em>Far Dareis Mai</em> carries my
honor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine&rsquo;s mouth tightened at the corners, but
apparently that was exactly the right thing to say so far as the
Maidens were concerned. Adelin and the others donned wide
grins.</p>

<p>Below, Aiel were crowding around wagon drivers as
they began unhitching the mules. Not everyone was paying attention
to the Aiel. Keille and Isendre stared at one another from beside
their wagons, Natael speaking urgently to one woman, Kadere to the
other, until they finally stopped their duel of eyes. The two women
had been like that for some time. Had they been men, Rand would
have expected it to come to blows long since.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be on your guard, Egwene,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;All of you,
be on your guard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even the Shaido will not bother Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Amys
told him, &ldquo;any more than they will bother Bair or Melaine or
myself. Some things are beyond even Shaido.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just be on your guard!&rdquo; He had not meant to be that
sharp. Even Rhuarc stared at him. They did not understand, and he
dared not tell them. Not yet. Who would spring their trap first? He
had to risk them as well as himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about me, Rand?&rdquo; Mat said suddenly, rolling a
gold coin across the fingers of one hand as though unaware of it.
&ldquo;You have any objections to my going with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want to? I thought you&rsquo;d stay with the
peddlers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat frowned at the wagons below, looked to the Shaido
lined before the mountain gap. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it will be so easy to
get out of here if you get yourself killed. Burn me if you don&rsquo;t
stick me in the rendering kettle one way or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Dovienya</em>,&rdquo; he muttered&mdash;Rand had heard him say that
before; Lan said it meant &ldquo;luck&rdquo; in the Old Tongue&mdash;and
flipped the gold coin into the air. When he tried to snatch it
back, it bounced off his fingertips and fell to the ground.
Somehow, improbably, the coin landed on edge, rolling downhill,
bounding across cracks in the baked clay, glittering in the
sunlight, all the way down to the wagons, where it finally fell
over. &ldquo;Burn me, Rand,&rdquo; he growled, &ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t do
that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Isendre picked up the coin and stood fingering it,
peering up at the hilltop. The others stared, too; Kadere, and
Keille, and Natael.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can come,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;Rhuarc, isn&rsquo;t it about
time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The clan chief glanced over his shoulder. &ldquo;Yes. Just
about&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Behind him, pipes began playing a slow dancing tune.
&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Singing rose to the pipes. Aiel boys stopped singing
when they reached manhood, except for certain occasions. Only in
battle songs and laments for the dead did an Aielman sing once he
had taken up the spear. There were surely Maidens&rsquo; voices in that
chanted harmony of parts, but deep male voices swallowed them.</p>

<p class="verse_quote">&ldquo;Wash the spears&mdash;while the sun climbs high.<br>
Wash the spears&mdash;while the sun falls low.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Half a mile to right and left Taardad appeared,
running in time to their song in two wide columns, spears ready,
faces veiled, seemingly endless columns rolling toward the
mountains.</p>

<p class="verse_quote">&ldquo;Wash the spears&mdash;Who fears to die?<br>
Wash the spears&mdash;No one I know!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the clan camps and in the fair, Aiel stared in
amazement; something in the way they held themselves told Rand they
were silent. Some of the wagon drivers stood as if stunned; others
let their mules run loose and dove under their wagons. And Keille
and Isendre, Kadere and Natael, watched Rand.</p>

<p class="verse_quote">&ldquo;Wash the spears&mdash;while life holds true.<br>
Wash the spears&mdash;until life ends.<br>
 Wash the spears&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we go?&rdquo; He did not wait for Rhuarc&rsquo;s nod to
heel Jeade&rsquo;en to a walk down the hill, Adelin and the other Maidens
falling in around him. Mat hesitated a moment before booting Pips
to follow, but Rhuarc and the Taardad sept chiefs, each with his
ten, stepped off with the dapple. Once, halfway to the fair tents,
Rand looked back to the hilltop. Moiraine and Egwene sitting their
horses with Lan. Aviendha standing with the three Wise Ones. All
watching him. He had almost forgotten what it was like not to have
people watching him.</p>

<p>As he rode abreast of the fair, a delegation came
out, ten or a dozen women in skirts and blouses and much gold and
silver and ivory, as many men in the grays and browns of the
<em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em> but unarmed save for a belt knife, and that
usually smaller than the heavy-bladed weapon Rhuarc wore. Still,
they took a position that forced Rand and the others to halt, and
appeared to ignore the veiled Taardad streaming by to east and
west.</p>

<p class="verse_quote">&ldquo;Wash the spears&mdash;Life is a dream.<br>
Wash the spears&mdash;All dreams must end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not expect this of you, Rhuarc,&rdquo; a heavyset,
gray-haired man said. He was not fat&mdash;Rand had not seen a fat
Aiel&mdash;his heaviness was muscle. &ldquo;Even from the Shaido it was
a surprise, but you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Times change, Mandhuin,&rdquo; the clan chief replied.
&ldquo;How long have the Shaido been here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They arrived just at sunrise. Why they traveled in
the night, who can say?&rdquo; Mandhuin frowned slightly at Rand, tilted
his head toward Mat. &ldquo;Strange times indeed, Rhuarc.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is here besides the Shaido?&rdquo; Rhuarc asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We Goshien arrived first. Then the Shaarad.&rdquo; The
heavy man grimaced over his blood enemies&rsquo; name, without stopping
his study of the two wetlanders. &ldquo;The Chareen and the Tomanelle
came later. And last the Shaido, as I said. Sevanna convinced the
chiefs to go in only a short time ago. Bael saw no reason to meet
today, nor did some of the others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A broad-faced woman in her middle years, with hair
yellower than Adelin&rsquo;s, put fists on her hips in a rattle of ivory
and gold bracelets. She wore as many, and as many necklaces, as
Amys and her sister-wife combined. &ldquo;We hear He Who Comes With the
Dawn has come out of Rhuidean, Rhuarc.&rdquo; She was frowning at Rand
and Mat. The entire delegation was. &ldquo;We hear that the
<em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> will be announced today. Before all of the
clans arrive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then someone spoke you a prophecy,&rdquo; Rand said. He
touched the dapple&rsquo;s flanks with his heels; the delegation moved
out of his way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Dovienya</em>,&rdquo; Mat murmured. &ldquo;<em>Mia dovienya
nesodhin soende</em>.&rdquo; Whatever it meant, it sounded a fervent
wish.</p>

<p>The Taardad columns had come up on either side of the
Shaido and turned to face them across a few hundred paces, still
veiled, still singing. They made no move that could be considered
threatening, really, only stood there, fifteen or twenty times the
Shaido numbers, and sang, voices thundering in chanting
harmony.</p>

<p class="verse_quote">&ldquo;Wash the spears&mdash;till shade is gone.<br>
Wash the spears&mdash;till water turns dry.<br>
Wash the spears&mdash;How long from home?<br>
Wash the spears&mdash;Until I die!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Riding closer to the black-veiled Shaido, Rand saw
Rhuarc lift a hand to his own veil. &ldquo;No, Rhuarc. We are not here to
fight them.&rdquo; He meant that he hoped it would not come to that, but
the Aielman took it differently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right, Rand al&rsquo;Thor. No honor to the
Shaido.&rdquo; Leaving his veil hanging, Rhuarc raised his voice. &ldquo;No
honor to the Shaido!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand did not turn his head to look, but he had the
feeling black veils were being lowered behind him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, blood and ashes!&rdquo; Mat muttered. &ldquo;Blood and
bloody ashes!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="verse_quote">&ldquo;Wash the spears&mdash;till the sun grows cold.<br>
Wash the spears&mdash;till water runs free.<br>
Wash the spears&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lines of Shaido shifted uneasily. Whatever
Couladin or Sevanna had told them, they could count. To dance the
spears with Rhuarc and those with him was one thing, even if it
went against all custom; to face enough Taardad to sweep them away
like an avalanche was something else. Slowly they parted, moving
back to let Rand ride through, stepping back to make a wide
path.</p>

<p>Rand heaved a sigh of relief. Adelin and the other
Maidens, at least, walked looking straight ahead, as though the
Shaido did not exist.</p>

<p class="verse_quote">&ldquo;Wash the spears&mdash;while I breathe.<br>
Wash the spears&mdash;my steel is bright.<br>
 Wash the spears&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chant faded to a murmur behind them as they
passed into the wide, steep-walled gorge, deep and shadowed as it
wound into the mountains. For minutes the loudest sounds were the
clatter of hooves on stone, the whisper of soft Aiel boots.
Abruptly the passage gave way to Alcair Dal.</p>

<p>Rand could see why the canyon had been called a bowl,
though there was nothing golden about it. Almost perfectly round,
its gray wall sloped all the way around except at the far end,
where it curled inward like a breaking wave. Clusters of Aiel
dotted the slopes, heads and faces bare, many more clusters than
there were clans. The Taardad who had come with the sept chiefs
peeled away toward one or another of those. According to Rhuarc,
grouping by society rather than clan was an aid to keeping peace.
Only his Red Shields and the Maidens continued on with Rand and the
Taardad chiefs.</p>

<p>The sept chiefs of the other clans all sat by clan,
cross-legged before a deep ledge beneath the curling overhang. Six
small knots, one of Maidens, stood between the sept chiefs and the
ledge. Supposedly these were the Aiel who had come for the honor of
clan chiefs. Six, although only five clans were represented.
Sevanna would have the Maidens&mdash;though Aviendha had been
quick to point out that Sevanna had never been <em>Far Dareis
Mai</em>&mdash;but the extra&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Eleven men in that, not ten.
Even seeing only the back of a flame-haired head, Rand was sure it
was Couladin.</p>

<p>On the ledge itself stood a golden-haired woman in as
much jewelry as the woman back at the fair tents, gray shawl draped
over her arms&mdash;Sevanna, of course&mdash;and four clan
chiefs, none armed save for his long belt knife, and one the
tallest man Rand had ever seen. Bael of the Goshien Aiel, by the
descriptions Rhuarc had given; the fellow had to be at least a hand
taller than Rhuarc or himself. Sevanna was speaking, and some trick
of the canyon&rsquo;s shape carried her words clearly throughout.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;allow him to speak!&rdquo; Her voice was tight and
angry. Head high and back straight she tried to dominate the ledge
by force of will. &ldquo;I demand it as my right! Until a new chief is
chosen, I stand for Suladric and the Shaido. I demand my
right!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You stand for Suladric until a new chief is chosen,
roofmistress.&rdquo; The white-haired man who spoke in irascible tones
was Han, clan chief of the Tomanelle. With a face like dark,
wrinkled leather, he would have been taller than average in the Two
Rivers; for an Aiel, he was short, if stocky. &ldquo;I have no doubt you
know the rights of a roofmistress well, but perhaps not so well
those of a clan chief. Only one who has entered Rhuidean may speak
here&mdash;and you, who stand in Suladric&rsquo;s place&rdquo;&mdash;Han did
not sound happy about that, but then he sounded as if he was seldom
happy&mdash;&ldquo;but the dreamwalkers have told our Wise Ones Couladin
was refused the right to enter Rhuidean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Couladin shouted something, plainly furious yet
indistinct&mdash;apparently the canyon&rsquo;s trick only worked from
the ledge&mdash;but Erim, of the Chareen, his own bright red hair
nearly half-white, cut him off sharply. &ldquo;Have you no respect for
custom and law, Shaido? Have you no honor? Stand silent here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few eyes on the slopes turned to see who the
newcomers were. A ripple of nudges brought more around at the sight
of two outlanders on horseback at the head of the sept chiefs, and
one of the riders followed close by Maidens. How many Aiel peered
down at him, Rand wondered. Three thousand? Four? More? None made a
sound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have gathered here to hear a great announcement,&rdquo;
Bael said, &ldquo;when all the clans have come.&rdquo; His dark reddish hair
was graying, too; there were no young men among clan chiefs. His
great height and deep voice drew eyes to him. &ldquo;When all the clans
have come. If all Sevanna wishes to speak of now is letting
Couladin speak, I will go back to my tents and wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jheran, of the Shaarad, blood enemy of Bael&rsquo;s
Goshien, was a slender man, gray streaked heavily through his light
brown hair. Slender, as a steel blade is slender, he spoke to no
one of the chiefs in particular. &ldquo;I say we do not return to our
tents. Since Sevanna has brought us in, let us discuss what is only
somewhat less important than the announcement we await. Water. I
wish to discuss the water at Chain Ridge Stand.&rdquo; Bael turned toward
him threateningly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fools!&rdquo; Sevanna snapped. &ldquo;I will have done with
waiting! I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was then that those on the ledge became aware of
the new arrivals. In utter silence they watched them approach, the
clan chiefs frowning, Sevanna scowling. She was a pretty woman,
well short of her middle years&mdash;and younger-looking for
standing among men well the other side of theirs&mdash;but with a
greedy mouth. The clan chiefs were dignified, even Han in a
sour-mouthed fashion; her pale green eyes had a calculating look.
Unlike any Aiel woman Rand had ever seen, she wore her loose white
blouse undone low enough to show considerable tanned cleavage,
framed by her many necklaces. He could have known the men for clan
chiefs by their manner; if Sevanna was a roofmistress, she was
surely nothing like Lian.</p>

<p>Rhuarc strode straight to the ledge, gave his spears
and buckler, his bow and quiver, to his Red Shields, and climbed
up. Rand handed his reins to Mat&mdash;who muttered, &ldquo;Luck with
us!&rdquo; as he eyed the surrounding Aiel; Adelin nodded encouragingly
to Rand&mdash;and stepped straight from his saddle to the ledge. A
startled murmur rolled around the canyon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you do, Rhuarc,&rdquo; Han demanded, scowling,
&ldquo;bringing this wetlander here? If you will not kill him, at least
send him down from standing like a chief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This man, Rand al&rsquo;Thor, has come to speak to the
chiefs of the clans. Did not the dreamwalkers tell you that he
would come with me?&rdquo; Rhuarc&rsquo;s words brought a louder murmur from
the listeners.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Melaine told me many things, Rhuarc,&rdquo; Bael said
slowly, frowning at Rand. &ldquo;That He Who Comes With the Dawn had come
out of Rhuidean. You cannot mean that this man&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He trailed
off in disbelief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If this wetlander can speak,&rdquo; Sevanna said quickly,
&ldquo;so may Couladin.&rdquo; She lifted a smooth hand, and Couladin scrambled
onto the ledge, face an angry red.</p>

<p>Han rounded on him. &ldquo;Stand down, Couladin! It is bad
enough that Rhuarc violates custom without you doing it as
well!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is time to be done with worn-out customs!&rdquo; the
fiery-haired Shaido shouted, stripping off his gray-and-brown coat.
There was no need for shouting&mdash;his words echoed across the
canyon&mdash;but he did not lower his voice. &ldquo;I am He Who Comes
With the Dawn!&rdquo; Shoving shirtsleeves above his elbows, he thrust
his fists into the air. Around each forearm wound a serpentine
creature scaled in crimson and gold, glittering metallically feet
each tipped with five golden claws, golden-maned heads resting on
the backs of his wrists. Two perfect Dragons. &ldquo;I am the
<em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>!&rdquo; The roar that came back was like thunder,
Aiel leaping to their feet and shouting joyously. The sept chiefs
were on their feet, too, the Taardad clustered worriedly, the
others shouting as loudly as anyone.</p>

<p>The clan chiefs looked stunned, even Rhuarc. Adelin
and her nine Maidens hefted their spears as if they expected to use
them any moment. Eyeing the gap leading out, Mat pulled his hat low
and guided the two horses close to the ledge, motioning
surreptitiously for Rand to get back into his saddle.</p>

<p>Sevanna smiled smugly, adjusting her shawl, as
Couladin strode to the front of the ledge with his arms high. &ldquo;I
bring change!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;According to the prophecy, I bring new
days! We will cross the Dragonwall again, and take back what was
ours! The wetlanders are soft, but rich! You remember the wealth
brought back when last we went into the Wetlands! This time, we
will take it all! This time&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand let the man&rsquo;s tirade wash over him. Of things
possible, he had never suspected this. <em>How?</em> The word kept
sliding through his head, yet he could not believe how composed he
was. Slowly he took off his coat, hesitating a moment before
fishing the <em>angreal</em> from his pocket; sticking it into the
waistband of his breeches, he dropped the coat and walked to the
front of the ledge, calmly undoing the laces of his sleeves. They
slid down as he raised his arms above his head.</p>

<p>It took a moment for the assembled Aiel to notice the
Dragons wrapped around his arms, too, shining in the sunlight.
Their hush came by increments, but it was total. Sevanna&rsquo;s mouth
dropped open; she had not known of this. Obviously Couladin had not
thought Rand would follow so quickly, had not told her another bore
the markings, too. <em>How?</em> The man must have believed he
would have time; once he had established himself, Rand could be
dismissed as a fraud. <em>Light, how?</em> If the roofmistess of
Comarda Hold was stunned now, so were the clan chiefs, save only
Rhuarc. Two men marked as prophecy said only one could be.</p>

<p>Couladin ranted on, waving his arms to make sure all
saw. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;will not stop with the lands of the oathbreakers! We
will take all the lands to the Aryth Ocean! The wetlanders cannot
stand against&mdash;&rdquo; Suddenly he became aware of the silence where
eager cries had been. He knew what had caused it. Without turning
to look at Rand, he shouted, &ldquo;Wetlander! Look at his clothes! A
wetlander!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A wetlander,&rdquo; Rand agreed. He did not raise his
voice, but the canyon carried it to everyone. The Shaido looked
startled for a moment, then grinned triumphantly&mdash;until Rand
went on. &ldquo;What does the Prophecy of Rhuidean say? &lsquo;Born of the
blood.&rsquo; My mother was Shaiel, a Maiden of the Chumai Taardad.&rdquo;
<em>Who was she really? Where did she come from?</em> &ldquo;My father
was Janduin, of the Iron Mountain sept, clan chief of the Taardad.&rdquo;
<em>My father is Tam al&rsquo;Thor. He found me, raised me, loved me. I
wish I could have known you, Janduin, but Tam is my father</em>. &ldquo;
&lsquo;Born of the blood, but raised by those not of the blood.&rsquo; Where
did the Wise Ones send to look for me? Into the holds of the
Three-fold Land? They sent across the Dragonwall, where I was
raised. According to the prophecy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bael and the other three nodded slowly, but
reluctantly; there was still the matter of Couladin also bearing
the Dragons, and doubtless they would rather have one of their own.
Sevanna&rsquo;s face had firmed; no matter who bore the real markings,
there was no doubt whom she supported.</p>

<p>Couladin&rsquo;s confidence never wavered; he sneered
openly at Rand, the first time he had even looked at him. &ldquo;How long
since the Prophecy of Rhuidean was first spoken?&rdquo; He still seemed
to think he had to shout. &ldquo;Who can say how much the words have
changed? My mother was <em>Far Dareis Mai</em> before she gave up
the spear. How much has the rest changed? Or been changed! It is
said we once served the Aes Sedai. I say they mean to bind us to
them once more! This wetlander was chosen because he resembles us!
He is none of our blood! He came with Aes Sedai leading him on a
leash! And the Wise Ones greeted them as they would first-sisters!
You have all heard of Wise Ones who can do things beyond belief.
The dreamwalkers used the One Power to keep me from this wetlander!
They used the One Power, as Aes Sedai are said to do! The Aes Sedai
have brought this wetlander here to bind us with fakery! And the
dreamwalkers help them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is madness!&rdquo; Rhuarc strode up beside Rand,
staring out at the still silent gathering. &ldquo;Couladin never went to
Rhuidean, I heard the Wise Ones refuse him. Rand al&rsquo;Thor did go. I
saw him leave Chaendaer, and I saw him return, marked as you
see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why did they refuse me?&rdquo; Couladin snarled.
&ldquo;Because the Aes Sedai told them to! Rhuarc does not tell you that
one of the Aes Sedai went down from Chaendaer with this wetlander!
That is how he returned with the Dragons! By Aes Sedai witchery! My
brother Muradin died below Chaendaer, murdered by this wetlander
and the Aes Sedai Moiraine, and the Wise Ones, doing Aes Sedai
bidding, let them walk free! When night came, I went to Rhuidean. I
did not reveal myself until now because this is the proper place
for the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> to show himself! I <em>am</em> the
<em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lies, touched with just enough flecks of truth. The
man was all victorious confidence, sure he had an answer for
anything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say you went to Rhuidean without the permission
of the Wise Ones?&rdquo; Han demanded, frowning. Towering Bael looked
just as disapproving with his arms folded, Erim and Jheran only
slightly less so. The clan chiefs, at least, still wavered. Sevanna
gripped her belt knife, glaring at Han as if she would like to
drive it into his back.</p>

<p>Couladin had his answer, though. &ldquo;Yes, without it! He
Who Comes With the Dawn brings change! So says the prophecy!
Useless ways must change, and I will change them! Did I not arrive
here with the dawn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The clan chiefs stood balanced on the edge, and so
did all the watching Aiel, all on their feet now, staring silently,
waiting in their thousands. If Rand could not convince them, he
likely would not leave Alcair Dal alive. Mat motioned again to
Jeade&rsquo;en&rsquo;s saddle. Rand did not even bother to shake his head.</p>

<p>There was a consideration beyond getting out alive;
he needed these people, needed their loyalty. He <em>had</em> to
have people who followed him because they believed, not to use him,
or for what he could give them. He had to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rhuidean,&rdquo; he said. The word seemed to fill the
canyon. &ldquo;You claim you went to Rhuidean, Couladin. What did you see
there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All know Rhuidean is not to be spoken of,&rdquo; Couladin
shot back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can go apart,&rdquo; Erim said, &ldquo;and speak in private
so you can tell us&mdash;&rdquo; The Shaido cut him off, face flushed
angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will speak of it with no one. Rhuidean is a holy
place, and what I saw was holy. <em>I</em> am holy!&rdquo; He raised his
Dragon marked arms again. &ldquo;These make me holy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I walked among glass columns beside
<em>Avendesora</em>.&rdquo; Rand spoke quietly, but the words carried
everywhere. &ldquo;I saw the history of the Aiel through my ancestors&rsquo;
eyes. What did you see, Couladin? I am not afraid to speak. Are
you?&rdquo; The Shaido quivered with rage, face nearly the color of his
fiery hair.</p>

<p>Uncertain looks passed between Bael and Erim, Jheran
and Han. &ldquo;We must go apart for this,&rdquo; Han muttered.</p>

<p>Couladin did not seem to realize he had lost his
advantage with the four, but Sevanna did. &ldquo;Rhuarc has told him
these things,&rdquo; she spat. &ldquo;One of Rhuarc&rsquo;s wives is a dreamwalker,
one of those who aids the Aes Sedai! Rhuarc has told him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rhuarc would not,&rdquo; Han snapped at her. &ldquo;He is clan
chief, and a man of honor. Do not speak of what you do not know,
Sevanna!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not afraid!&rdquo; Couladin shouted. &ldquo;No man can call
me afraid! I, too, saw with my ancestors&rsquo; eyes! I saw our coming to
the Three-fold Land! I saw our glory! The glory I will bring back
to us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw the Age of Legends,&rdquo; Rand announced, &ldquo;and the
beginning of the Aiel journey to the Three-fold Land.&rdquo; Rhuarc
caught his arm, but he shook the clan chief off. This moment had
been fated since the Aiel gathered before Rhuidean the first time.
&ldquo;I saw the Aiel when they were called the Da&rsquo;shain Aiel, and
followed the Way of the Leaf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; The shout rose from out in the canyon and
spread in a roar. &ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; From thousands of throats. Spearpoints
shaken in the air caught the sunlight. Even some of the Taardad
sept chiefs were shouting. Adelin stared up at Rand, stricken. Mat
shouted something at Rand, lost in the thunder, waving urgently for
him to take his saddle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Liar!&rdquo; The canyon&rsquo;s shape carried Couladin&rsquo;s bellow,
wrath mixed with triumph, over the shouts of the gathering. Shaking
her head frantically, Sevanna reached for him. She must at least
have suspected now that he was the fake, yet if she could keep him
quiet they might yet pull it off. As Rand hoped, Couladin pushed
her away. The man knew Rand had been to Rhuidean&mdash;he could
not possibly believe half of his own story&mdash;but neither could
he believe this. &ldquo;He proves himself a fraud from his own mouth! We
have always been warriors! Always! To the beginning of time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The roar swelled, spears shaking, but Bael and Erim,
Jheran and Han stood in stony silence. They knew now. Unaware of
their looks, Couladin waved his Dragon-wreathed arms to the
assembled Aiel, exulting in the adulation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Rhuarc said softly beside Rand. &ldquo;Did you not
understand why we do not speak of Rhuidean? To face that we were
once so different from everything we believe, that we were the same
as the despised Lost Ones you call Tuatha&rsquo;an. Rhuidean kills those
who cannot face it. Not more than one man in three lives who goes
to Rhuidean. And now you have spoken for all to hear. It cannot be
stopped here, Rand al&rsquo;Thor. It will spread. How many will be strong
enough to bear it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>He will take you back, and he will destroy
you</em>. &ldquo;I bring change,&rdquo; Rand said sadly. &ldquo;Not peace, but
turmoil.&rdquo; <em>Destruction follows on my heels everywhere. Will
there ever be anywhere I do not tear apart?</em> &ldquo;What will be,
will be, Rhuarc. I can&rsquo;t change it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will be, will be,&rdquo; the Aielman murmured after a
moment.</p>

<p>Couladin still strode up and down, shouting to the
Aiel of glory and conquest, unaware of the clan chiefs staring at
his back. Sevanna did not look at Couladin at all; her pale green
eyes were intent on the clan chiefs, lips pulled back in a grimace,
breasts heaving with anxious breaths. She had to know what their
silent stares meant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand al&rsquo;Thor,&rdquo; Bael said loudly, the name slicing
through Couladin&rsquo;s shouts, cutting off the roar of the crowd like a
blade. He stopped to clear his throat, head swinging as though
seeking a way out of this. Couladin turned, folding his arms
confidently, no doubt expecting a sentence of death for the
wetlander. The very tall clan chief took a deep breath. &ldquo;Rand
al&rsquo;Thor is the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>. Rand al&rsquo;Thor is He Who Comes
With the Dawn.&rdquo; Couladin&rsquo;s eyes widened in incredulous fury.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand al&rsquo;Thor is He Who Comes With the Dawn,&rdquo;
leathery-faced Han announced, just as reluctantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand al&rsquo;Thor is He Who Comes With the Dawn.&rdquo; That
from Jheran, grimly, and from Erim, &ldquo;Rand al&rsquo;Thor is He Who Comes
With the Dawn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand al&rsquo;Thor,&rdquo; Rhuarc said, &ldquo;is He Who Comes With
the Dawn.&rdquo; In a voice too soft to carry even from the ledge, he
added, &ldquo;And the Light have mercy on us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a long, stretched moment the silence lasted. Then
Couladin leaped snarling from the ledge, snatching a spear from one
of his <em>Seia Doon</em>, hurling it straight at Rand. Yet as he
moved down, Adelin leaped up; his spearpoint stabbed through the
layered bullhide of her outstretched buckler, swinging her
around.</p>

<p>Pandemonium exploded through the canyon, men shouting
and shoving. The other Jindo Maidens jumped up beside Adelin,
forming a screen in front of Rand. Sevanna had climbed down to
shout urgently at Couladin, hanging on his arm as he tried to lead
his Shaido Black Eyes against the Maidens between him and Rand.
Heirn and a dozen more Taardad sept chiefs joined Adelin, spears
ready, but others were shouting loudly. Mat scrambled up, gripping
his black-hafted spear with its raven-marked sword point, roaring
what had to be curses in the Old Tongue. Rhuarc and the other clan
chiefs raised their voices, vainly trying to restore order. The
canyon boiled like a cauldron. Rand saw veils lifted. A spear
flashed, stabbing. Another. He had to stop this.</p>

<p>He reached out for <em>saidin</em>, and it flooded
into him until he thought he would burst if he did not burn first;
the filth of the taint spreading through him seemed to curdle his
bones. Thought floated outside the Void; cold thought. Water. Here
where water was so scarce, the Aiel always talked of water. Even in
this dry air there was some water. He channeled, not really knowing
what he did, reached out blindly.</p>

<p>Sharp lightning crackled above Alcair Dal, and the
wind rushed in from every direction, howling across the lip of the
canyon to drown the Aiel&rsquo;s shouts. Wind, bringing minute traces of
water, more and more, until something happened no man had ever seen
there. A mist of rain began to fall. The wind above shrieked and
swirled. Wild lightnings streaked the sky. And the rain grew
heavier and heavier, to a driving downpour, sweeping over the
ledge, plastering his hair to his head and his shirt to his back,
blanking out everything fifty paces away.</p>

<p>Abruptly the rain stopped hitting him; an invisible
dome expanded around him, pushing Mat and the Taardad away. Through
the water pouring down inside he could dimly see Adelin pounding at
it, trying to force her way through to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You utter fool, playing games with these other
fools! Wasting all my planning and effort!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Water dripped down his face as he turned to face
Lanfear. Her silver-belted white dress was perfectly dry, the black
waves of her hair untouched by a single raindrop among the silver
stars and crescents. Those large black eyes stared at him
furiously; anger twisted her beautiful face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect you to reveal yourself yet,&rdquo; he said
quietly, the Power still filled him; he rode the buffeting
torrents, holding on with a desperation he kept out of his voice.
It was not necessary to pull in more, only to let it come till it
seemed his bones would crisp to ash. He did not know if she could
shield him while <em>saidin</em> actually roared through him, but
he let it fill him against the possibility. &ldquo;I know you are not
alone. Where is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lanfear&rsquo;s beautiful mouth tightened. &ldquo;I knew he would
give himself away, coming into your dream. I could have managed
matters if his panic&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew from the start,&rdquo; he broke in. &ldquo;I expected it
from the day I left the Stone of Tear. Out here, where anyone could
see I was fixed on Rhuidean and the Aiel. Do you think I did not
expect some of you to come after me? But the trap is <em>mine</em>,
Lanfear, not yours. Where is he?&rdquo; The last came as a cold shout.
Emotion skittered uncontrollably around the Void that surrounded
him inside, the emptiness that was not empty, the emptiness filled
with the Power.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you knew,&rdquo; she snapped back, &ldquo;why did you chase
him away with your talk of fulfilling your destiny, of doing
<em>what has to be done</em>?&rdquo; Scorn weighted the words like
stones. &ldquo;I brought Asmodean to teach you, but he was always one to
leap to another plan if the first proved difficult. Now he thinks
he has found something better for himself in Rhuidean. And he is
off to take it while you stand here. Couladin, the Draghkar, all to
hold your attention while he made sure. All my plans for nothing
because you must be stubborn! Do you have any idea what effort it
will take to convince him again? It must be him. Demandred or
Rahvin or Sammael would kill you before teaching you to lift a hand
unless they have you bound like a dog at heel!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rhuidean. Yes. Of course. Rhuidean. How many weeks to
the south? Yet he had done something once. If he could remember how&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;And you let him go? After all your talk of aiding me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not openly, I said! What could he find in Rhuidean
worth my coming into the open? When you agree to stand with me will
be time enough. Remember what I told you, Lews Therin.&rdquo; Her voice
took on a seductive note; those full lips curved, those dark eyes
tried to swallow him like bottomless pools. &ldquo;Two great
<em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>. With those, together, we can. challenge&mdash;&rdquo; This time she stopped on her own. He had remembered.</p>

<p>With the Power <em>he folded</em> reality,
<em>bent</em> a small patch of what was. A door opened beneath the
dome in front of him. That was the only way to describe it. An
opening into darkness, into somewhere else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do remember a few things, it seems.&rdquo; She eyed
the doorway, shifted that suddenly suspicious gaze to him. &ldquo;Why are
you so anxious? What is in Rhuidean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Asmodean,&rdquo; he said grimly. For a moment he
hesitated. He could not see beyond the rain-drenched dome. What was
happening out there? And Lanfear. If only he could remember how he
had shielded Egwene and Elayne. <em>If only I could make myself
kill a woman who&rsquo;s only frowning at me. She is one of the
Forsaken!</em> It was no more possible now than it had been in the
Stone.</p>

<p>Stepping through the door, he left her on the ledge
and closed it behind him. No doubt she knew how to make one of her
own, but the making of it would slow her down.</p>
