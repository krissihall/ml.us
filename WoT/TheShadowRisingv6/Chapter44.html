<h4><em>The Breaking Storm</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">P</span>errin
opened his eyes slowly, staring up at the
plain white plastered ceiling. It took a moment to realize he was
in a four-posted bed, lying on a feather mattress with a blanket
over him and a goose-down pillow under his head. A myriad of scents
danced in his nose; the feathers and the wool of the blanket, a
goose roasting, bread and honeycakes baking. One of the Winespring
Inn&rsquo;s rooms. With unmistakable bright morning light streaming in at
the white-curtained windows. Morning. He fumbled at his side.
Unbroken skin met his fingers, but he felt weaker than at any time
since being shot. A small enough price, though, and a fair enough
exchange. His throat felt parched, too.</p>

<p>When he moved, Faile leaped up from a chair beside
the small stone fireplace, tossing aside a red blanket and
stretching. She had changed to a darker narrow-skirted riding
dress, and wrinkles in the gray silk said she had slept in that
chair. &ldquo;Alanna said you needed sleep,&rdquo; she said. He reached toward
the white pitcher on the small table beside the bed, and she
hurriedly poured a cup of water and held it for him to drink. &ldquo;You
need to stay right here for another two or three days, until you
have your strength back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words sounded normal, except for an undercurrent
he barely caught, a tightness at the corners of her eyes. &ldquo;What is
wrong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She replaced the cup carefully on the bedside table
and smoothed her dress. &ldquo;Nothing is wrong.&rdquo; The taut underlying
tone was even clearer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faile, don&rsquo;t lie to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not lie!&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;I will have some
breakfast brought up to you, and you&rsquo;re lucky I do that, calling me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faile.&rdquo; He said her name as sternly as he could, and
she hesitated, her most arrogant, chin-up glare changing to
forehead-creasing worry and back again. He met her gaze straight
on; she was not going to get away with any fine lady&rsquo;s haughty
tricks with him.</p>

<p>At last, she sighed. &ldquo;I suppose you have a right to
know. But you are still staying in that bed until Alanna and I say
you can get up. Loial and Gaul are gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone?&rdquo; He blinked in confusion. &ldquo;What do you mean
gone? They <em>left</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a way. The sentries saw them go, this morning at
first light, trotting off into the Westwood together. None of them
thought anything of it; certainly none tried to stop them, an Ogier
and an Aiel. I heard of it less than an hour ago. They were talking
about trees, Perrin. About how the Ogier sing to trees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trees?&rdquo; Perrin growled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that bloody Waygate!
Burn me, I told him not to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;They&rsquo;ll get themselves killed
before they reach it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Throwing off the blanket, he swung his legs over the
side of the bed, wobbling to his feet. He had nothing on, he
realized, not even his smallclothes. But if they expected to keep
him caged under a blanket, they were sadly mistaken. He could see
everything folded neatly on the tall-backed chair by the door, with
his boots beside it and his axe hanging by its belt from a peg on
the wall. Stumbling to his clothes, he began dressing as quickly as
he could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; Faile demanded. &ldquo;You put
yourself back in that bed!&rdquo; One fist on her hip, she pointed
commandingly, as if her finger could transport him there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t have gotten that far,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;Not
afoot. Gaul won&rsquo;t ride, and Loial always did claim he trusted his
own feet more than any horse. I can catch them up on Stepper by
midday latest.&rdquo; Pulling his shirt over his head he left it hanging
loose over his breeches and sat down&mdash;dropped, actually&mdash;to draw on his boots.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are mad, Perrin Aybara! What chance you can even
find them in that forest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not so bad at tracking, myself. I can find
them.&rdquo; He smiled at her, but she was not having any.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can get yourself killed, you hairy fool! Look at
you. You can hardly stand. You would fall out of the saddle before
you had gone a mile!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hiding the effort involved, he stood and stamped his
feet to settle them in his boots. Stepper would do all the work; he
only needed to hold on. &ldquo;Nonsense. I&rsquo;m strong as a horse. Stop
trying to bully me.&rdquo; Shrugging into his coat, he snatched up his
axe and belt. Faile caught his arm as he opened the door, and was
pulled along, vainly trying to haul him back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes you have the brains of a horse,&rdquo; she
panted. &ldquo;Less! Perrin, you must listen to me. You must&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The room lay only a few steps along the narrow
hallway from the stairs leading down to the empty common room, and
it was the stairs that betrayed him. When his knee bent to lower
him that first step, it kept right on bending; he toppled forward,
vainly trying to catch the banister, pulling a yelling Faile with
him. Rolling over and over, they thumped down the stairs to come up
with a final thud against the barrel at the bottom, Faile lying
stretched full-length atop him. The barrel teetered and spun,
rattling the swords inside, before settling with a final clank.</p>

<p>It took a moment for Perrin to gather enough breath
to speak. &ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; he said anxiously. She was sprawled
limply on his chest. He shook her gently. &ldquo;Faile, are you&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slowly she raised her head and brushed a few short
strands of dark hair from her face, then stared at him intently.
&ldquo;Are <em>you</em> all right? Because if you are, I may very well do
something violent to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin snorted; she was probably hurt less than he.
Gingerly, he felt at where the arrow had been, but that was in no
worse shape than the rest of him. Of course, the rest of him seemed
bruised from head to toe. &ldquo;Get off of me, Faile. I need to fetch
Stepper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instead, she seized his collar with both hands and
leaned very close, until their noses almost touched. &ldquo;Listen to me,
Perrin,&rdquo; she said urgently. &ldquo;You&mdash;can&mdash;not&mdash;do&mdash;everything. If Loial
and Gaul have gone to lock the Waygate, you must let them. Your
place is here. Even if you were strong enough&mdash;and you are
not! Do you hear me? You are not strong enough!&mdash;but even if
you were, you must not go after them. You cannot do
everything!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, whatever are you two doing?&rdquo; Marin al&rsquo;Vere
said. Wiping her hands on her long white apron, she came from the
back door of the common room. Her eyebrows looked to be trying to
climb into her hair. &ldquo;I expected Trollocs after all that racket,
but not this.&rdquo; She sounded half scandalized, and half amused.</p>

<p>What they looked like, Perrin realized, with Faile
lying on him that way, their heads close together, was a couple
playing kissing games. On the floor of the common room.</p>

<p>Faile&rsquo;s cheeks reddened and she got up very quickly,
dusting her dress. &ldquo;He is as stubborn as a Trolloc, Mistress
al&rsquo;Vere. I told him he was too weak to rise. He must go back to his
bed immediately. He has to learn he cannot do everything himself,
especially when he cannot even walk down a flight of steps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear,&rdquo; Mistress al&rsquo;Vere said, shaking her
head, &ldquo;that is quite the wrong way.&rdquo; Leaning close to the younger
woman, she whispered softly, but Perrin heard every word. &ldquo;He was
an easy little boy to manage most of the time, if you handled him
properly, but when you tried to push him, he was as muley as any in
the Two Rivers. Men don&rsquo;t really change that much, only grow
taller. If you go telling him what he <em>must</em> and <em>
musn&rsquo;t</em> do, he will surely lay his ears back and dig his heels
in. Let me show you.&rdquo; Marin turned a beaming smile on him, ignoring
his glare. &ldquo;Perrin, don&rsquo;t you think one of my good goose-feather
mattresses is better than that floor? I&rsquo;ll bring you some of my
kidney pie just as soon as we have you tucked in. You must be
hungry, after no supper last night. Here. Why don&rsquo;t let me help you
up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pushing their hands away, he stood on his own. Well,
with the aid of the wall. He thought he might have sprained half
the muscles in his body. Muley? He had never been muley in his
life. &ldquo;Mistress al&rsquo;Vere, would you have Hu or Tad saddle
Stepper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re better,&rdquo; she said, trying to turn him
toward the stairs. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you could do with just a little
more rest?&rdquo; Faile took his other arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trollocs!&rdquo; The cry from outside came muffled through
the walls, echoed by a dozen voices. &ldquo;Trollocs! Trollocs!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That needn&rsquo;t concern you today,&rdquo; Mistress al&rsquo;Vere
said, firm and soothing at the same time. It made him want to grit
his teeth. &ldquo;The Aes Sedai will handle things nicely. In a day or
two we&rsquo;ll have you back on your feet. You will see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My horse,&rdquo; he said, trying to pull free. They had
good holds on his coatsleeves; all he accomplished was swinging
them back and forth. &ldquo;For the love of the Light, will you stop
tugging at me and let me get my horse? Let go of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Looking at his face, Faile sighed and released his
arm. &ldquo;Mistress al&rsquo;Vere, will you have his horse saddled and brought
around?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But my dear, he really needs&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please, Mistress al&rsquo;Vere,&rdquo; Faile said firmly.
&ldquo;And my horse, too.&rdquo; The two women looked at each other as if he
did not exist. At last Mistress al&rsquo;Vere nodded.</p>

<p>Perrin frowned at her back as she hurried across the
common room and vanished toward the kitchen, and the stable. What
had Faile said different from what he had? Turning his attention to
her, he said, &ldquo;Why did you change your mind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tucking his shirt in for him, she muttered under her
breath. Doubtless he was not supposed to hear well enough to
understand. &ldquo;I musn&rsquo;t say must, must I? When he is too stubborn to
see straight, I must lead him with honey and smiles, must I?&rdquo; She
shot him a glare that surely had no honey in it, then abruptly
changed to a smile so sweet he very nearly backed away. &ldquo;My dear
heart,&rdquo; she almost cooed, pulling his coat straight, &ldquo;whatever is
happening out there, I do hope you will stay in your saddle, and as
far from Trollocs as you can. You really are not up to facing a
Trolloc just yet, are you? Maybe tomorrow. Please remember you are
a general, a leader, and every bit as much a symbol to your people
as that banner out there. If you are up where people can see you,
it will lift everyone&rsquo;s heart. And it is much easier to see what
needs doing and give orders if you aren&rsquo;t in the fighting
yourself.&rdquo; Picking his belt off the floor, she buckled it around
his waist, settling the axe carefully on his hip. She also batted
her eyes at him! &ldquo;Please say you will do that. Please?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was right. He would not last two minutes against
a Trolloc. More like two seconds against a Fade. And much as he
hated to admit it, he would not last two miles in the saddle
chasing after Loial and Gaul. <em>Fool Ogier. You&rsquo;re a writer, not
a hero</em>. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said. A mischievous impulse seized
him. The way she and Mistress al&rsquo;Vere had been talking over his
head, and batting her eyes as if he were a fool. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t refuse
you anything when you smile so prettily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>am</em> glad.&rdquo; Still smiling, she brushed at
his coat, picking lint he could not see. &ldquo;Because if you don&rsquo;t, and
you manage to survive, I&rsquo;ll do to you what you did to me that first
day in the Ways. I don&rsquo;t think you are strong enough yet to stop
me.&rdquo; That smile beamed up into his face, all springtime and
sweetness. &ldquo;Do you understand me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He chuckled in spite of himself. &ldquo;Sounds as if I had
better let them kill me.&rdquo; She did not seem to think that was
funny.</p>

<p>Hu and Tad, the lanky stablemen, led Stepper and
Swallow around soon after they stepped outside. Everyone else
seemed to be gathered at the far end of the village, beyond the
Green with its sheep and cows and geese, and that crimson-and-white
wolfhead banner rippling on the morning breeze. As soon as he and
Faile were up on their horses, the stablemen took off running that
way, too, without a word.</p>

<p>Whatever was going on, it was clearly not an attack.
He could see women and children in the crowd, and the shouts of
&ldquo;Trolloc&rdquo; had died down to a murmur like an echo of the geese. He
rode slowly, not wanting to waver in his saddle; Faile kept Swallow
close, watching him. If she could change her mind once for no
reason, she could again, and he did not want any arguments about
whether he should be there.</p>

<p>The babbling crowd did appear to contain everyone in
Emond&rsquo;s Field, villagers and farmers alike, all jammed shoulder to
shoulder, but they made way for him and Faile when they saw who he
was. His name entered the murmurs, usually tagged with Goldeneyes.
He picked up the word &ldquo;Trollocs,&rdquo; too, but in tones more wondering
than frightened. From Stepper&rsquo;s back he had a good view over their
heads.</p>

<p>The knotted mass of people stretched all the way
beyond the last houses to the hedge of sharpened stakes. The edge
of the forest, nearly six hundred paces off across a field of
stumps nearly level with the ground, was quiet and empty of men
with axes. Those men made a sweaty, bare-chested ring in the crowd
surrounding Alanna and Verin and two men. Jon Thane, the miller,
was wiping a smear of blood from his ribs, lantern jaw on his chest
so he could stare at what his hands were doing. Alanna straightened
from the other man, a grizzle-haired fellow Perrin did not know,
who leaped to his feet and danced a step as if not quite believing
he could. He and the miller both looked at the Aes Sedai with
awe.</p>

<p>The tangle around the Aes Sedai was too tight for
anyone to shift aside for Stepper and Swallow, but there were
smaller clear pockets around Ihvon and Tomas, off to either side on
their war-horses. Folk did not want to come too near those
fierce-eyed animals, both looking as though they only wanted an
opportunity to bite or trample.</p>

<p>Perrin managed to reach Tomas without too much
trouble. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Trolloc. Only one.&rdquo; Despite the graying Warder&rsquo;s
conversational tone, his dark eyes did not rest on Perrin and
Faile, but kept an almost equal watch on Verin and on the treeline.
&ldquo;They usually are not very smart, alone. Sly, but not smart. The
timbering party drove it away before it did more than draw some
blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From out of the trees the two Aiel women appeared,
running, heads <em>shoufa</em>-wrapped and veiled so he could not
tell which was which. They slowed to snake between the
sharp-pointed stakes, then slipped deftly through the crowd, people
moving out of their way as much as possible in that press. By the
time they reached Faile, they had unveiled, and she leaned down to
listen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps five hundred Trollocs,&rdquo; Bain told her,
&ldquo;probably no more than a mile or two behind us.&rdquo; Her voice was
level, but her dark blue eyes sparkled with eagerness. So did
Chiad&rsquo;s gray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I expected,&rdquo; Tomas said calmly. &ldquo;That one likely
wandered off from the larger body hoping to find a meal. The rest
will be coming soon, I think.&rdquo; The Maidens nodded.</p>

<p>Perrin gestured in consternation at the jam of
people. &ldquo;They shouldn&rsquo;t be out here, then. Why haven&rsquo;t you cleared
them away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Ihvon, bringing his gray into the gathering,
who answered. &ldquo;Your people do not seem to want to listen to
outsiders, not when they can watch Aes Sedai. I would suggest you
see what you can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin was sure they could have imposed some sort of
order had they really tried. Verin and Alanna surely could have.
<em>So why did they wait and leave it to me, if they expected
Trollocs?</em> It would have been easy to put it down to <em>
ta&rsquo;veren</em>&mdash;easy, and foolish. Ihvon and Tomas were not
going to let Trollocs kill them&mdash;or Verin, or Alanna&mdash;while waiting for a <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> to tell them what to do. The
Aes Sedai were maneuvering him, risking everyone, maybe even
themselves. But to what possible end? He met Faile&rsquo;s eyes, and she
nodded slightly, as if she knew what he was thinking.</p>

<p>He had no time to try figuring it out now. Scanning
the crowd, he spotted Bran al&rsquo;Vere, putting his head together with
Tam al&rsquo;Thor and Abell Cauthon. The Mayor had a long spear on his
shoulder and a dented old round steel cap on his head. A leather
jerkin sewn all over with steel discs strained around his bulk.</p>

<p>All three men looked up when Perrin pushed Stepper
through the crowd to them. &ldquo;Bain says Trollocs are heading this
way, and the Warders think we may be attacked soon.&rdquo; He had to
shout because of the incessant drone of voices. Some of the nearer
folk heard and fell silent; quiet spread on ripples of &ldquo;Trolloc&rdquo;
and &ldquo;attack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bran blinked. &ldquo;Yes. It had to come, didn&rsquo;t it? Yes,
well, we know what to do.&rdquo; He should have looked comic, with his
jerkin ready to pop its seams and his steel cap wobbling when he
nodded, but he only looked determined. Raising his voice, he
announced, &ldquo;Perrin says the Trollocs will be here soon. You all
know your places. Hurry, now. Hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crowd stirred and flowed, women herding children
back toward the houses, men milling every which way. Confusion
seemed to grow more rather than less.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see to getting the shepherds in,&rdquo; Abell told
Perrin, and dove into the throng.</p>

<p>Cenn Buie pushed past in the moil, using a halberd to
herd sour-faced Hari Coplin and Hari&rsquo;s brother Darl and old Bili
Congar, who staggered as if already full of ale this morning, which
he probably was. Of the three, Bili carried his spear most as if he
meant to use it. Cenn touched his forehead to Perrin in a sort of
salute. A number of the men did. It made him uncomfortable. Dannil
and the other lads were one thing, but these men were half again
his age and more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are doing fine,&rdquo; Faile said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew what Verin and Alanna were up to,&rdquo; he
muttered. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t mean right now.&rdquo; Two of the catapults the
Warders had had built stood at this end of the village, squarish
things taller than a man, all heavy timbers and thick, twisted
ropes. From their horses, Ihvon and Tomas were overseeing the stout
wooden beams being winched down. The two Aes Sedai were more
interested in the big fieldstones, fifteen or twenty pounds each,
being loaded in cups on the end of those arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They mean you to be a leader,&rdquo; Faile replied
quietly. &ldquo;It is what you were born for, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin snorted. He had been born to be a blacksmith.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be a lot more comfortable if I knew why they wanted it.&rdquo; The
Aes Sedai were looking at him, Verin with head tilted, birdlike,
Alanna with a franker stare and a small smile. Did they both want
the same thing, and for the same reason? That was one of the
troubles with Aes Sedai. There were always more questions than
answers.</p>

<p>Order asserted itself with surprising quickness.
Along this west end of the village a hundred men knelt on one knee
right behind the bristle of stakes, uneasily fingering spears or
halberds or some polearm made from a bush hook or scythe. Here and
there one wore a helmet or some bit of armor. To their rear, twice
as many formed two lines holding good Two Rivers longbows, each
with a pair of quivers at his belt. Young boys came running from
the houses with bundles of more arrows that the men drove
point-down in the ground in front of their feet. Tam seemed to be
in charge, dressing the ranks and speaking a few words to each man,
but Bran marched along with him, offering his own encouragement.
Perrin could not see that they needed him at all.</p>

<p>To his surprise, Dannil and Ban and all the other
lads who had ridden with him came trotting out of the village to
surround him and Faile, all with their bows. They looked odd, in a
way. The Aes Sedai had apparently Healed the more seriously
injured, leaving those less hurt for Daise&rsquo;s poultices and
ointments, so fellows who had been barely clinging to a saddle
yesterday walked along sprightly now, while Dannil and Tell and
others still limped or wore bandages. If he was surprised to see
them, he was disgusted by what they brought. Leof Torfinn, the
dressing wrapped around his head making a pale cap above his
deep-set eyes, had his bow slung on his back and carried a tall
staff with a smaller version of the red-bordered banner with its
wolfhead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think one of the Aes Sedai had it made,&rdquo; Leof said
when Perrin asked where it came from. &ldquo;Milli Ayellin brought it to
Wil&rsquo;s da, but Wil didn&rsquo;t want to carry it.&rdquo; Wil al&rsquo;Seen hunched
his shoulders a bit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want to carry it, either,&rdquo; Perrin said
dryly. They all laughed as if he had made a joke, even Wil, after a
minute.</p>

<p>The hedge of stakes looked fierce enough, but on the
other hand, it seemed a pitiful thing to keep Trollocs out. Maybe
it would, but he did not want Faile there if they made it through.
When he looked at her, though, she had that look in her eyes again
as if she knew what he was thinking. And did not like it. If he
tried to send her back, she would argue and balk, refusing to see
sense. Weak as he felt right then, she probably had a better chance
of leading him back to the inn than he her. The way she was sitting
her saddle so ferociously, <em>she</em> likely intended to defend
<em>him</em>, if the Trollocs broke through. He would just have to
keep a close eye on her; that was all there was to it.</p>

<p>Suddenly she smiled, and he scratched his beard.
Maybe she <em>could</em> read his mind.</p>

<p>Time passed, the sun inching up, the day&rsquo;s warmth
building. Now and then a woman called from the houses to ask what
was happening. Here and there men sat down, but Tam or Bran was on
them before they had their legs folded, chivying them back into
line. No more than a mile or two, Bain had said. She and Chiad were
sitting near the stakes, playing some game that apparently involved
flipping a knife into the foot of ground between them. Surely if
the Trollocs were coming, they would have come by now. He was
beginning to find it hard to sit up straight. Conscious of Faile&rsquo;s
watchful eyes, he kept his back stiff.</p>

<p>A horn blared, brazen and shrill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trollocs!&rdquo; half a dozen voices shouted, and bestial,
blackmailed shapes flooded out of the Westwood, howling as they ran
across the stumpy ground, waving scythe-curved swords and spiked
axes, spears and tridents. Three Myrddraal rode behind them on
black horses, darting back and forth as though driving the Trolloc
charge before them. Their dead black cloaks hung motionless no
matter how their mounts dashed or whirled. The horn sounded
continuously in sharp, urging cries.</p>

<p>Twenty arrows leaped out as soon as the first Trolloc
appeared, the strongest shot falling nearly a hundred paces
short.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold, you lack-witted sheep-brains!&rdquo; Tam shouted.
Bran jumped and gave him a startled look, no less incredulous than
those coming from Tam&rsquo;s friends and neighbors; some muttered about
not standing still for that kind of talk, Trollocs or no Trollocs.
Tam rode right over their protests, though. &ldquo;You hold till I give
the word, the way I showed you!&rdquo; Then, as if hundreds of shrieking
Trollocs were not galloping toward him, Tam turned calmly to
Perrin. &ldquo;At three hundred paces?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin nodded quickly. The man was asking him? Three
hundred paces. How quickly could a Trolloc cover three hundred
paces? He eased his axe in its loop. That horn wailed and wailed.
The spearmen crouched behind the stakes as if forcing themselves
not to edge back. The Aiel had veiled their faces.</p>

<p>Onward the screaming tide came, all horned heads and
faces with snouts or beaks, each half again as tall as a man, each
shrieking for blood. Five hundred paces. Four hundred. Some were
stretching out in front. They ran as fast as horses. Had the Aiel
been right? Could there be only five hundred? It looked like
thousands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ready!&rdquo; Tam called, and two hundred bows were
raised. The young men with Perrin hurriedly formed up in front of
him in imitation of their elders, ranking themselves with that fool
banner.</p>

<p>Three hundred paces. Perrin could see those misshapen
faces, contorted with rage and frenzy, as clearly as if they were
right on top of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Loose!&rdquo; Tam shouted. Bowstrings slapped like one
huge whip-crack. With twin crashes of beam against leather-padded
beam, the catapults fired.</p>

<p>Broadhead arrows rained down into the Trollocs.
Monstrous shapes fell, but some rose and staggered on, harried by
the Fades. That horn wove into their guttural bellowing, sounding
forward for the kill. The catapults&rsquo; stones fell among them&mdash;and exploded in fire and shards, ripping open holes in the mass.
Perrin was not the only one to jump; so that was what the Aes Sedai
had been doing with the catapults. He wondered wildly what would
happen if they dropped one of those stones loading it into the
cup.</p>

<p>Another flight of arrows leaped out, and another,
another, and again and again, and more stones from the catapults,
if at a slower pace. Fiery explosions tore at the Trollocs.
Broadhead points hailed down on them. And they came on, shrieking,
howling, falling and dying, but always running forward. They were
close now, close enough that the bowmen spread out, no longer
firing in flights but choosing their targets. Men screamed their
own rage, screamed in the face of death as they shot.</p>

<p>And then there were no more Trollocs standing. Only
one Fade, bristling with arrows yet still staggering blindly. The
shrill shrieks of a Myrddraal&rsquo;s thrashing horse competed with the
moaning bellows of downed and dying Trollocs. The horn had fallen
silent at last. Here and there across the stump-filled field, a
Trolloc heaved and fell back. Under it all, Perrin could hear men
panting as if they had run ten miles. His own heart seemed to be
pounding out of his chest.</p>

<p>Suddenly someone raised a loud huzzah, and with that
men began capering and shouting euphorically, waving bows or
whatever they had over their heads, tossing caps in the air. Women
rushed out from the houses, laughing and cheering, and children,
all celebrating and dancing with the men. Some came running to grab
Perrin&rsquo;s hand and shake it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve led us to a great victory, my boy.&rdquo; Bran
laughed up at him. He had his steel cap perched on the back of his
head. &ldquo;I suppose I shouldn&rsquo;t call you that, now. A great victory,
Perrin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do anything,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;I just sat on
my horse. You did it.&rdquo; Bran listened no more than any of the
others. Embarrassed, Perrin sat up straight, pretending to survey
the field, and after a while they left him alone.</p>

<p>Tam had not joined in the celebrating; he stood close
behind the stakes, studying the Trollocs. The Warders were not
laughing, either. Black-mailed shapes littered the field among the
low stumps. There could be five hundred of them. Maybe less. Some,
a few, might have made it back to the trees. None lay closer than
fifty paces from the pointed hedge. Perrin found the other two
Fades, writhing on the ground. That accounted for all three. They
would admit they were dead eventually.</p>

<p>The Two Rivers folk raised a thunderous cheer, for
him. &ldquo;Perrin Goldeneyes! Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They had to know,&rdquo; he muttered. Faile looked at him
questioningly. &ldquo;The Halfmen had to know this wouldn&rsquo;t work. Look
out there. Even I can see it, now; they must have from the start.
If this was all they had, why did they try? And if there are more
Trollocs out there, why didn&rsquo;t they all come? Twice as many, and
we&rsquo;d have had to fight them at the stakes. Twice that, and they
might have broken through to the village.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a good natural eye,&rdquo; Tomas said, reining in
beside them. &ldquo;This was a test. To see if you would break at the
sight of a charge, perhaps to see how quickly you could react, or
how your defenses are organized, or maybe something I&rsquo;ve not
thought of, but still a test. Now they see.&rdquo; He pointed to the sky,
where a lone raven winged over the field. A natural raven would
have lighted to feast among the dead. The bird completed a last
circle and peeled off toward the forest. &ldquo;The next attack will not
come right away. I saw two or three Trollocs reach the forest, so
word of this will spread. The Halfmen will have to make them
remember they&rsquo;re more afraid of Myrddraal than of dying. That
attack will come, however, and it will certainly be stronger than
this. How strong depends on how many the Faceless have brought
through the Ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin grimaced. &ldquo;Light! What if there are ten
thousand of them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not likely,&rdquo; Verin said, walking up to pat Tomas&rsquo;s
mount on the neck. The warhorse allowed her touch as meekly as a
pony. &ldquo;At least, not yet. Not even a Forsaken could move a large
party through the Ways safely, I think. One man alone risks death
or madness between the closest Waygates, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;say&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a
thousand men, or a thousand Trollocs, would very likely draw <em>
Machin Shin</em> within minutes, a monstrous wasp to a bowl of
honey. It is much more probable that they travel no more than ten
or twenty together, fifty at most, and the groups spaced out. Of
course, the questions remain of how many groups they are bringing,
and how much time they allow to elapse between. And they would lose
some anyway. It might be that Shadowspawn attract <em>Machin
Shin</em> less than humankind, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Hmmm. Fascinating thought.
I wonder&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Patting Tomas on the leg much in the manner she had
patted his horse, she turned away, already lost in study. The
Warder heeled his horse after her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you ride even one step near the Westwood,&rdquo; Faile
said calmly, &ldquo;I will haul you back to the inn by your ear and stuff
you into that bed myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of it,&rdquo; Perrin lied, turning
Stepper so his back was to the woods. One man and an Ogier might
escape notice, make it to the mountains safely. They might. The
Waygate had to be locked permanently if Emond&rsquo;s Field was to have
any chance. &ldquo;You talked me out of it, remember?&rdquo; Another man might
find them, knowing they were there. Three sets of eyes could keep
sharper watch than two, especially when one set was his, and he was
certainly not doing anything here. His clothes stuffed with straw
and set on Stepper could do as much.</p>

<p>Suddenly, above the shouting and carrying on around
him, he heard sharper shouts, a clamor from the south, near the Old
Road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said they wouldn&rsquo;t come again soon!&rdquo; he growled,
and dug his heels into Stepper&rsquo;s flanks.</p>
