<h4><em>Revelations in Tanchico</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">E</span>layne
fumbled with the two slim red-lacquered
sticks, trying to set them properly in her fingers. <em>Sursa</em>,
she reminded herself. <em>Not sticks; sursa. A fool way to eat,
whatever they&rsquo;re called</em>.</p>

<p>On the other side of the table in the Chamber of
Falling Blossoms, Egeanin frowned at her own sursa, one upright in
each hand as if they really were sticks. Nynaeve held hers nestled
in her hand the way Rendra had showed them, but so far she had
managed to lift one sliver of meat and a few sliced peppers as far
as her mouth; her eyes were tight with determination. A great many
small white bowls covered the table, each filled with slices and
tiny slivers of meat and vegetables, some in sauces dark or pale.
Elayne thought it might take the rest of the day to finish this
meal. She gave the honey-haired innkeeper a grateful smile when the
woman leaned over her shoulder to position the sursa properly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your land is at war with Arad Doman,&rdquo; Egeanin said,
sounding almost angry. &ldquo;Why do you serve the dishes of your
enemy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rendra shrugged, making a moue behind her veil; she
wore the palest possible red today, and beads of the same color
woven into her narrow braids made soft clicks when she moved her
head. &ldquo;It is the fashion, now. Four days ago the Garden of Silver
Breezes began it, and now almost every patron asks for the Domani
food. I think maybe it is that if we cannot conquer the Domani, at
least we can conquer their food. Maybe in Bandar Eban they eat the
lamb with the honey sauce and the glazed apples, yes? In four days
more, perhaps it is something else. The fashion, it changes quickly
now, and if someone whips up the mob against this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She
shrugged again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think there will be <em>more</em> riots?&rdquo;
Elayne asked. &ldquo;Over what sort of food inns are serving?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The streets, they are restive,&rdquo; Rendra said,
spreading her hands fatalistically. &ldquo;Who can say what will spark
them again? The uproar the day before yesterday, it came from a
rumor Maracru had declared for the Dragon Reborn, or maybe fallen
to the Dragonsworn, or the rebels perhaps&mdash;how seems to have
made little difference&mdash;but does the mob turn on the people
from Maracru? No. They rampage through the streets, pulling people
from the carriages, and then burn the Grand Hall of the Assembly.
Perhaps the word comes that the army, it has won a battle&mdash;or lost one&mdash;and the mob rises against those who serve Domani
food. Or maybe it burns warehouses on the Calpene docks. Who can
say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No proper order,&rdquo; Egeanin muttered, thrusting the
sursa firmly between the fingers of her right hand. From the
expression on her face, they might have been daggers she was going
to use to stab what was in the bowls. A bit of meat dropped out of
Nynaeve&rsquo;s sursa short of her lips; growling, she snatched it from
her lap, dabbing at the cream-colored silk with her napkin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aah, order.&rdquo; Rendra laughed. &ldquo;I remember order.
Maybe it will come again one day, yes? Some thought the Panarch
Amathera would put the Civil Watch back at their duties, but were I
she, with the memory of the mob brawling outside my investiture&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The Children of the Light, they killed very many of the rioters.
Perhaps this means there will not be another riot, but perhaps it
means the next riot, it will be twice so big, or ten times. I think
that I, too, would keep the Watch and the Children close around me.
But this is no talk to disturb the meal.&rdquo; Examining the table, she
nodded to herself in approval, the beads in her thin plaits
clicking. As she turned toward the door, she paused with a small
smile. &ldquo;It is the fashion to eat the Domani food with the sursa,
and of course one does what is the fashion. But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;there are
none here to see save yourselves, yes? Should you perhaps wish the
spoons and the forks, they are under the napkin.&rdquo; She indicated the
tray on the end of the table. &ldquo;Enjoy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve and Egeanin waited until the door closed
behind the innkeeper, then grinned at each other and reached for
the tray with decidedly unseemly haste. Elayne still managed to get
her spoon and fork first; neither of the others had ever had to eat
in the few minutes between a novice&rsquo;s chores and lessons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is tasty enough,&rdquo; Egeanin said after her first
mouthful, &ldquo;when you can put any on your tongue.&rdquo; Nynaeve laughed
with her.</p>

<p>In the seven days since meeting the dark-haired woman
with her sharp blue eyes and slow drawl, they had both come to like
her. She was a refreshing change from Rendra&rsquo;s chatter about hair
and clothes and complexions, or stares in the street from people
who looked as if they would slit a throat for a copper. This was
her fourth visit since that first meeting, and Elayne had enjoyed
every one. Egeanin had a directness and an air of independence she
admired. The woman might be only a small trader in whatever came
her way, but she could challenge Gareth Bryne for saying what she
meant and bowing to no one.</p>

<p>Still, Elayne wished the visits had not been so
frequent. Or rather that she and Nynaeve had not been at the Three
Plum Court so often for Egeanin to find. Almost constant riots
since Amathera&rsquo;s investiture made moving about the city all but
impossible, however, despite their coterie of Domon&rsquo;s tough
sailors. Even Nynaeve had admitted as much after they had had to
flee a shower of fist-sized stones. Thom still promised to find
them a carriage and team, but she was not too certain how hard he
was looking. He and Juilin both seemed insufferably pleased that
she and Nynaeve were mired inside the inn. <em>They come back
bruised or bleeding and don&rsquo;t want us to even stub a toe</em>, she
thought wryly. Why did men always think it was right to keep you
safer than they kept themselves? Why did they think their injuries
mattered less than yours?</p>

<p>From the taste of the meat, she suspected Thom should
look in the kitchens here if he wanted to find horses. The thought
of eating horse made her stomach queasy. She chose a bowl
containing only vegetables, bits of dark mushroom, red peppers and
some sort of feathery green sprouts in a pale, tangy sauce. &ldquo;What
shall we discuss today?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked Egeanin. &ldquo;You have asked
almost every question I can think of.&rdquo; Nearly every one they knew
how to answer at any rate. &ldquo;If you want to learn any more about Aes
Sedai, you&rsquo;ll have to go to the Tower as a novice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egeanin flinched unconsciously, as she did at any
words linking the Power to her. For a moment she stirred the
contents of one of the small bowls, frowning at it. &ldquo;You have not
made any real effort,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;to keep secret from me
that you are looking for someone. Women. If it does not intrude on
your secrets, I would ask&mdash;&rdquo; She cut off at a knock on the
door.</p>

<p>Bayle Domon strode in without waiting, grim
satisfaction warring with uneasiness on his round face. &ldquo;I have
found them,&rdquo; he began, then gave a start at the sight of Egeanin.
&ldquo;You!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shockingly, Egeanin knocked over her chair leaping
up, and threw a fist at Domon&rsquo;s thick middle almost too fast to
see. Somehow Domon caught her wrist in a big hand, twisted&mdash;there was a flurried instant where they seemed to be trying to hook
each other&rsquo;s ankle with a foot; Egeanin attempted to strike him in
the throat&mdash;then somehow, she was facedown on the floor,
Domon&rsquo;s boot on her shoulder and her arm levered up hard against
his knee. Despite that she snatched her belt knife free.</p>

<p>Elayne wove flows of Air around the pair before she
even knew she had embraced <em>saidar</em>, freezing them where
they were. &ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo; she demanded in her best
icy tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dare you, Master Domon?&rdquo; Nynaeve&rsquo;s voice was
equally cold. &ldquo;Unhand her!&rdquo; More warmly, worriedly, she added,
&ldquo;Egeanin, why did you try to hit him? I told you to release her,
Domon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He cannot, Nynaeve.&rdquo; Elayne did wish the other woman
could at least see flows clearly without being angry. <em>She</em>
did <em>try to hit him first</em>. &ldquo;Egeanin, why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dark-haired woman lay there with eyes shut and
mouth tight; her knuckles stood out bloodless from her grip on the
knife hilt.</p>

<p>Domon glared from Elayne to Nynaeve, his odd Illianer
beard nearly bristling. His head was all that Elayne had left free
to move. &ldquo;The woman do be Seanchan!&rdquo; he growled.</p>

<p>Elayne exchanged startled looks with Nynaeve.
Egeanin? Seanchan? It was impossible. It must be impossible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you certain?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked slowly, quietly. She
sounded as stunned as Elayne felt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will never forget her face,&rdquo; Domon replied firmly.
&ldquo;A ship captain. It did be she who did take me to Falme, me and my
ship, captives to the Seanchan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egeanin made no effort to deny it, only lay there
gripping her knife. Seanchan. <em>But I like her!</em></p>

<p>Carefully, Elayne shifted the weave of flows until
Egeanin&rsquo;s knife hand lay uncovered to the wrist. &ldquo;Let go of it,
Egeanin,&rdquo; she said, kneeling beside the woman. &ldquo;Please.&rdquo; After a
moment, Egeanin&rsquo;s hand fell open. Elayne picked up the knife and
backed away, loosing the flows completely. &ldquo;Let her up, Master
Domon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She be Seanchan, Mistress,&rdquo; he protested, &ldquo;and hard
as iron spikes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let her up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Muttering under his breath, he released Egeanin&rsquo;s
wrist, moving, away from her quickly as if he expected she might
come at him again. The dark-haired woman&mdash;the <em>
Seanchan</em> woman&mdash;merely stood, though. She worked the
shoulder he had wrenched, eyeing him thoughtfully, glanced at the
door, then raised her head and waited with every outward appearance
of calm. It was hard not to keep on admiring her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seanchan,&rdquo; Nynaeve growled. She clutched a fistful
of her long braids, then gave her hand an odd stare and let go, but
her brows were still furrowed and her eyes hard. &ldquo;Seanchan! Worming
your way into our friendship. I thought you had all gone back where
you came from. Why are you here, Egeanin? Was our meeting really an
accident? Why did you seek us out? Did you mean to lure us
somewhere your filthy <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> could lock their leashes
around our throats?&rdquo; Egeanin&rsquo;s blue eyes widened fractionally. &ldquo;Oh,
yes,&rdquo; Nynaeve told her sharply. &ldquo;We know about you Seanchan and
your <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> and <em>damane</em>. We know more than you.
You chain women who channel, but those you use to control them can
channel too, Egeanin. For every woman who can channel that you&rsquo;ve
leashed like an animal, you walk by another ten or twenty every
day without realizing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Egeanin said simply, and Nynaeve&rsquo;s mouth
fell open.</p>

<p>Elayne thought her own eyes were going to pop out of
her head. &ldquo;You know?&rdquo; She took a breath and went on in something
less like an incredulous squeal. &ldquo;Egeanin, I think you are lying.
I&rsquo;ve not met many Seanchan before, and never for more than a few
minutes, but I know someone who has. Seanchan don&rsquo;t even hate women
who channel. They think they are animals. You&rsquo;d not take it so
easily if you knew, or even believed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Women who can wear the bracelet are women who can
learn to channel,&rdquo; Egeanin said. &ldquo;I did not know it <em>could</em>
be learned&mdash;I was taught a woman either could or could not&mdash;but when you told me that girls must be guided if they are
not born with it, I reasoned it out. May I sit down?&rdquo; So cool.</p>

<p>Elayne nodded, and Domon set Egeanin&rsquo;s chair upright,
standing behind it while she sat. Looking over her shoulder at him,
the dark-haired woman said, &ldquo;You were not so&mdash;difficult&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;an opponent the last time we met.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did have twenty armored soldiers on my deck
then, and a <em>damane</em> ready to break my ship apart with the
Power. Just because I can hook a shark from a boat, I do no offer
to wrestle it in the water.&rdquo; Surprisingly, he grinned at her,
rubbing his side where she must have gotten in a blow Elayne had
not seen. &ldquo;You are no so easy an opponent yourself as I did think
you would be without your armor and sword.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman&rsquo;s world had to have been turned upside down
by her own reasoning, but she was taking it matter-of-factly.
Elayne could not imagine what would spin her own world topsy-turvy
that way, but she hoped that if she ever found out she could face
it with Egeanin&rsquo;s calm reserve. <em>I have to stop liking her. She
is Seanchan. They&rsquo;d have collared me far a pet if they could.
Light, how do you stop liking someone?</em></p>

<p>Nynaeve appeared to be having no such difficulty.
Planting her fists on the table, she leaned toward Egeanin so
fiercely her braids dangled among the small bowls. &ldquo;Why are you
here in Tanchico? I thought you had all fled after Falme. And why
have you tried to wriggle your way into our trust like some
egg-eating snake? If you think you can collar us, think again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was never my intention,&rdquo; Egeanin said stiffly.
&ldquo;All I ever wanted from you was to learn about Aes Sedai. I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;
For the first time she seemed hesitant, unsure of herself.
Compressing her lips, she looked from Nynaeve to Elayne and shook
her head. &ldquo;You are not as I was taught. The Light be upon me, I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;like you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You like us.&rdquo; Nynaeve made it sound a crime. &ldquo;That
answers none of my questions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egeanin hesitated again, then held her head up,
defying them to do their worst. &ldquo;<em>Sul&rsquo;dam</em> were left behind
at Falme. Some deserted after the disaster. A few of us were sent
to bring them back. I only found one, but I discovered that an <em>
a&rsquo;dam</em> would hold her.&rdquo; Seeing Nynaeve&rsquo;s fists tighten, she
quickly added, &ldquo;I let her go last night. I will pay dearly if that
is ever discovered, but after talking with you, I could not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Grimacing, she shook her head. &ldquo;That is why I stayed with you
after Elayne revealed herself. I knew Bethamin was a <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em>. To discover the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> held her, that she
could&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I had to know, to understand, about women who could
channel.&rdquo; She took a deep breath. &ldquo;What do you mean to do with me?&rdquo;
Her hands, folded on the table, did not tremble.</p>

<p>Nynaeve opened her mouth angrily, and closed it again
slowly. Elayne knew her difficulty. Nynaeve might hate Egeanin now,
but what <em>were</em> they to do with her? It was not clear she
had committed any crime in Tanchico, and in any event the Civil
Watch seemed interested in nothing beyond saving its own collective
skin. She was Seanchan, she had used <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> and <em>
damane</em>, but on the other hand, she claimed to have let this
Bethamin go free. For what crime could they punish her? Asking
questions they had answered freely? Making them like her?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to stripe your hide till you glow like a
sunset,&rdquo; Nynaeve growled. Abruptly her head swung toward Domon.
&ldquo;You found them? You said you found them. Where?&rdquo; He shifted his
feet, shooting a meaning look at the back of Egeanin&rsquo;s head,
eyebrows rising in a question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not believe she is a Darkfriend,&rdquo; Elayne said
when Nynaeve hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I certainly am not!&rdquo; Egeanin&rsquo;s stare was fierce-eyed
and offended.</p>

<p>Folding her arms as if to keep from tugging her
braids, Nynaeve glared at the woman, then shifted an accusatory
frown to Domon, as though this entire mess were his fault. &ldquo;There
isn&rsquo;t anywhere to lock her,&rdquo; she said finally, &ldquo;and Rendra would
surely demand reasons. Go ahead, Master Domon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave a last, doubtful look at Egeanin. &ldquo;At the
Panarch&rsquo;s Palace, one of my men did see two of the women on your
list. The one with the cats, and the Saldaean woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you certain?&rdquo; Nynaeve said. &ldquo;At the Panarch&rsquo;s
Palace? I wish you had seen for yourself. More women than Marillin
Gemalphin like cats. And Asne Zeramene is not the only woman from
Saldaea, even in Tanchico.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A narrow-faced blue-eyed woman with a wide nose
feeding a dozen cats in this city where people do eat cats? In the
company of another with that Saldaean nose and tilted eyes? That is
no so common a pair, Mistress al&rsquo;Meara.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;But the Panarch&rsquo;s Palace?
Master Domon, in case you have forgotten, five hundred Whitecloaks
guard that place, commanded by an Inquisitor of the Hand of the
Light! Jaichim Carridin and his officers at least must know Aes
Sedai on sight. Would they remain if they saw the Panarch
sheltering Aes Sedai?&rdquo; He opened his mouth, but Nynaeve&rsquo;s point was
telling, and nothing came out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Domon,&rdquo; Elayne said, &ldquo;what was one of your
men doing at the Panarch&rsquo;s Palace?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He tugged at his beard in an embarrassed way, and
rubbed his bare upper lip with a wide finger. &ldquo;You see, the Panarch
Amathera do be known to like ice peppers, the white kind that be
very hot, and whether or no she be amenable to gifts herself, the
customs men will know who did give her one and be more amenable
themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gifts?&rdquo; Elayne said in her best reproving voice.
&ldquo;You were more honest on the docks, and called them bribes.&rdquo;
Surprisingly, Egeanin had twisted around in her chair to give him a
disapproving look, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fortune prick me,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;you did no ask me
to give up my trade. And I would no if you did, no if you did bring
my aged mother to ask. A man do have a right to his trade.&rdquo; Egeanin
snorted and righted herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His bribes are not our problem, Elayne.&rdquo; Nynaeve
sounded exasperated. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if he bribes the entire city and
smuggles&mdash;&rdquo; A rap at the door cut her off. With a cautioning
look at the others, she snapped &ldquo;You sit quiet&rdquo; to Egeanin, and
raised her voice. &ldquo;Come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Juilin stuck his head into the room with that silly
cylindrical cap on, frowning as usual at Domon. The gash on his
dark cheek, the blood already dried, was not unusual either; the
streets were rougher now by daylight than they had been by dark in
the beginning. &ldquo;May I speak to you alone, Mistress al&rsquo;Meara?&rdquo; he
said when he saw Egeanin sitting at the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come in,&rdquo; Nynaeve told him sharply. &ldquo;After what
she&rsquo;s heard already, it won&rsquo;t matter if she hears a little more.
Have you found them in the Panarch&rsquo;s Palace, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the act of shutting the door, he shot an
unreadable, tight-mouthed glance at Domon. The smuggler smiled,
showing too many teeth. For a moment it seemed they might come to
blows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So the Illianer is ahead of me,&rdquo; Juilin muttered
ruefully. Ignoring Domon, he addressed Nynaeve. &ldquo;I told you the
woman with the white stripe would lead me to them. That is a very
distinctive thing. And I saw the Domani woman there, too. From a
distance&mdash;I am not fool enough to wade into a school of
silverpike&mdash;but I cannot believe there is another Domani
woman besides Jeaine Caide in all of Tarabon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean they <em>are</em> in the Panarch&rsquo;s Palace?&rdquo;
Nynaeve exclaimed.</p>

<p>Juilin&rsquo;s face did not change, but his dark eyes
widened slightly, flickered toward Domon. &ldquo;So he had no proof,&rdquo; he
murmured in a satisfied tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did have proof,&rdquo; Domon avoided looking at the
Tairen. &ldquo;If you did no accept it before this fisherman did come,
Mistress al&rsquo;Meara, it be no fault of mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Juilin drew himself up, but Elayne cut in before the
thief-catcher could speak. &ldquo;You both found them, and you both
brought proof. Very likely neither would have been sufficient
without the other. Now we know where they are because of you both.&rdquo;
If anything, they looked more disgruntled than before. Men could be
absolutely silly at times.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Panarch&rsquo;s Palace.&rdquo; Nynaeve jerked a fistful of
braids, then flung the long plaits over her shoulder with a toss of
her head. &ldquo;What they are after must be there. But if they have it,
why are they still in Tanchico? The palace is huge. Maybe they
haven&rsquo;t found it yet. Not that that helps if we are out here while
they are inside!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom, as usual, entered without knocking, taking in
everyone at one glance. &ldquo;Mistress Egeanin,&rdquo; he murmured, with an
elegant bow his limp did nothing to diminish. &ldquo;Nynaeve, if I could
speak with you alone, I have important news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fresh bruise on his leathery cheek made Elayne
even angrier than the new tear in his good brown cloak. The man was
too old to be braving the streets of Tanchico. Or any rough
streets, for that matter. It was time she arranged a pension for
him, and somewhere safe and comfortable to live. No more gleeman
wanderings from village to village for him. She would see to
it.</p>

<p>Nynaeve gave Thom a sharp look. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no time for
that now. The Black sisters are in the Panarch&rsquo;s Palace, and for
all I know, Amathera is helping them search it from cellar to
attic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I found out less than an hour ago,&rdquo; he said
disbelievingly. &ldquo;How did you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; He looked at Domon and
Juilin, both still glowering like boys who had each wanted the
whole cake.</p>

<p>It was obvious that he dismissed either as Nynaeve&rsquo;s
source of information. Elayne felt like grinning. He did so pride
himself on knowing all the undercurrents, all the hidden doings.
&ldquo;The Tower has its ways, Thom,&rdquo; she told him, cool and mysterious.
&ldquo;It is best not to inquire too closely into the methods of Aes
Sedai.&rdquo; He frowned, bushy white eyebrows drawing down uncertainly.
Most satisfactory. She became aware of Juilin and Domon frowning at
her, too, and suddenly it was all she could do not to blush. If
they talked, she <em>would</em> look a fool. They would,
eventually; men did. Best to bury it quickly and hope. &ldquo;Thom, have
you heard anything that might indicate whether Amathera is a
Darkfriend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; He tugged one long mustache irritably.
&ldquo;Apparently she has not seen Andric since donning the Crown of the
Tree. Maybe the troubles in the streets make travel between the
King&rsquo;s Palace and the Panarch&rsquo;s too dangerous. Maybe she has simply
realized that her power equals his now, and is no longer as
compliant as before. Nothing to say what her allegiances are.&rdquo; With
a glance at the dark-haired woman in the chair, he added, &ldquo;I am
grateful for the aid Mistress Egeanin gave you with those robbers,
but to now I have thought she was a casually met friend. May I ask
who she is to be brought into this? I seem to recall you
threatening to tie a knot in any careless tongues, Nynaeve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s Seanchan,&rdquo; Nynaeve told him. &ldquo;Close your mouth
before you swallow a moth, Thom, and sit down. We can eat while we
try to figure out what to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In front of her?&rdquo; Thom said. &ldquo;Seanchan?&rdquo; He had
heard some of the story of Falme from Elayne&mdash;some of it&mdash;and he had certainly heard the rumors here; he studied
Egeanin as if wondering where she hid her horns. Juilin seemed to
be strangling, if his bulging eyes were any indication; he must
have heard the Tanchican rumors, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suggest I ask Rendra to lock her in a
storeroom?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked calmly. &ldquo;That <em>would</em> cause
comment, wouldn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;m fairly certain three big, hairy men can
protect Elayne and me if she pulls a Seanchan army out of her
pouch. Sit, Thom, or else eat standing up, but stop staring. All of
you, sit. I mean to eat before it grows cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They did, Thom looking as ill-contented as Juilin and
Domon. Sometimes Nynaeve&rsquo;s bullying manner did seem to work.
Perhaps Rand <em>would</em> respond to occasional bullying.</p>

<p>Putting Rand out of her mind, Elayne decided it was
time to add something of worth. &ldquo;I cannot see how the Black sisters
can be in the Panarch&rsquo;s Palace without Amathera&rsquo;s knowledge,&rdquo; she
said, pulling her chair under her. &ldquo;As I see it, that makes for
three possibilities. One, Amathera is a Darkfriend. Two, she thinks
they are Aes Sedai. And three, she is their prisoner.&rdquo; For some
reason, Thom&rsquo;s approving nod made her feel warm inside. Silly. Even
if he did know the Game of Houses, he was just a foolish bard who
had thrown it all away to become a gleeman. &ldquo;In any case, she will
help them look for what they seek, but it seems to me that if she
thinks they are Aes Sedai, we might be able to gain her help with
the truth. And if she is a prisoner, we could gain it by freeing
her. Even Liandrin and her companions could not hold on to the
palace if the Panarch ordered it cleared, and that would give <em>
us</em> a free hand to search.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The problem is discovering whether she is ally, dupe
or captive,&rdquo; Thom said, gesturing with his pair of sursa. He knew
how to use the things perfectly!</p>

<p>Juilin shook his head. &ldquo;The real problem is to reach
her, whatever her situation. Jaichim Carridin has five hundred
Whitecloaks around the palace like fisher-birds around the docks.
The Panarch&rsquo;s Legion has nearly twice that, and the Civil Watch
almost as many. Few of the ring forts are held half so well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are not going to fight them,&rdquo; Nynaeve said dryly.
&ldquo;Stop thinking with the hair on your chest. This is a time for
wits, not muscle. As I see it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The discussion went on through the meal, continuing
after the last small bowl was emptied. Egeanin even offered a few
cogent comments after a while spent silently, not eating and not
seeming to listen. She had a sharp mind and Thom readily accepted
any of her suggestions he agreed with, though he stubbornly
rejected out of hand those he did not, just the way he treated
everyone else. Even Domon, rather surprisingly, supported Egeanin
when Nynaeve wanted her to keep quiet. &ldquo;She do make sense, Mistress
al&rsquo;Meara. Only a fool do reject sense, wherever it do come
from.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, knowing where the Black sisters were
did little good without knowing whether or not Amathera was with
them; that, or what they were after. In the end, almost two hours
of discussion came to not much more than that and a few suggestions
as to how to find out about Amathera. All of which, it seemed, were
to be used by the men with their spiderweb of contacts
crisscrossing Tanchico.</p>

<p>None of the fool men wanted to leave them alone with
one of the Seanchan&mdash;until Nynaeve became angry enough to
wrap them all three in flows of Air while they dithered before the
door. &ldquo;Do you not think,&rdquo; she said icily, surrounded by the glow of
<em>saidar</em>, &ldquo;that one of us might be able to do the same to
her if she says boo?&rdquo; She would not release any of them until they
all nodded their heads, the only bits they could move.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You keep a taut crew,&rdquo; Egeanin said as soon as the
door closed behind them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, Seanchan!&rdquo; Nynaeve folded her arms
tightly; she seemed to have given up trying to pull at those braids
when she was angry. &ldquo;Sit down, and&mdash;be&mdash;quiet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was frustrating waiting there, staring at the plum
trees and falling blossoms painted on the windowless walls, pacing
the floor or watching Nynaeve pace, while Thom and Juilin and Domon
were out actually doing something. Yet it was worse when each man
came back at intervals, to report another trail faded away to
nothing, another thread snapped, hear what the others had learned,
and hurry out again.</p>

<p>The first time Thom returned&mdash;with a second
purple bruise, on the other cheek&mdash;Elayne said, &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you
do better here, Thom, where you could hear whatever Juilin and
Master Domon report? You could evaluate much better than Nynaeve or
I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shook his foolish shaggy white head while Nynaeve
sniffed loudly enough to be heard in the hallway. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a lead to a
house on the Verana, where Amathera supposedly went sneaking some
nights before she was raised Panarch.&rdquo; And he was gone before she
could say another word.</p>

<p>When he next returned&mdash;limping distinctly more,
reporting that the house was the home of Amathera&rsquo;s old nurse&mdash;Elayne spoke in her firmest voice. &ldquo;Thom, I want you to sit
down. You will stay here. I will not have you getting yourself
hurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurt?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Child, I never felt better in my
life. Tell Juilin and Bayle there is supposedly a woman named
Cerindra somewhere in this city who claims to know all sorts of
dark secrets about Amathera.&rdquo; And off he hobbled, cloak swirling
behind him. He had another tear in that, too. Stubborn, stubborn,
foolish old man.</p>

<p>Once a clamor penetrated the thick walls, brutal
shouts and cries from the street. Rendra bustled into the room just
when Elayne had decided to go down and see for herself what it was.
&ldquo;Some little trouble outside. Do not disturb yourself. Bayle
Domon&rsquo;s men, they keep it away from us, yes. I did not want you to
worry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A riot here?&rdquo; Nynaeve said sharply. The immediate
neighborhood of the inn had been one of the few calm areas in the
city.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not to worry,&rdquo; Rendra said soothingly. &ldquo;Perhaps they
want food. I will tell them where Bayle Domon&rsquo;s soup kitchen is,
and they will go away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The noise did die down after a while, and Rendra sent
up some wine. Not until the serving man was leaving, with a sulky
look on his face, did Elayne realize it was the young man with the
beautiful brown eyes. The man had begun reacting to her coldest
stares as if they were smiles. Did the fool think she had time to
notice him now?</p>

<p>Waiting and pacing, pacing and waiting. Cerindra
turned out to be a tirewoman dismissed for theft; not at all
grateful for not being imprisoned, she would make any accusation
against Amathera that was suggested to her. A fellow who claimed to
have proof that Amathera was Aes Sedai and Black Ajah also claimed
that the same documents proved King Andric the Dragon Reborn. The
group of women whom Amathera used to meet in secret were friends
Andric despised, and the shocking discovery that she financed
several smuggling craft led nowhere. Almost every noble but the
King himself had a finger in smuggling. Every trail ended that way.
The worst Thom could discover was that Amathera had convinced two
handsome young lords that each was the true love of her life and
Andric only a means to an end. On the other hand, she had given
audiences in the Panarch&rsquo;s Palace to various lords, both alone and
in company with various women recognizable as Liandrin and others
on the list, and reportedly asked and accepted their advice for her
decisions. Ally, or captive?</p>

<p>When Juilin came back, a good three hours after
sunset, spinning a thumb-thick staff of ridged wood and muttering
about some pale-haired fellow who had tried to rob him, Thom and
Domon were already slumped disconsolately at the table with
Egeanin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This will be Falme again,&rdquo; Domon growled at the air.
The stout cudgel he had acquired somewhere lay in front of him, and
he wore a short sword at his belt now. &ldquo;Aes Sedai. The Black Ajah.
Meddling with the Panarch. If we do no find something tomorrow, I
do mean to take myself out of Tanchico. The next day for certain,
if my own sister do ask me to stay!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; Thom said wearily, elbows on the table
and chin on fists. &ldquo;I am too tired to think straight any longer. I
found myself listening to a laundryman from the Panarch&rsquo;s Palace
who claims he has heard Amathera singing bawdy songs, the sort you
hear in the roughest taverns on the docks. I actually listened to
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For me,&rdquo; Juilin said, reversing a chair to straddle
it, &ldquo;I mean to look on tonight. I found a roofman who says the
woman he keeps company with was another of Amathera&rsquo;s tirewomen.
According to him, Amathera discharged all of her tirewomen without
warning the same evening she was invested Panarch. He will take me
to talk with her after he finishes some business of his own at a
merchant&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve moved to the end of the table, fists on hips.
&ldquo;You will not be going anywhere tonight, Juilin. The three of you
will be taking turns guarding our door.&rdquo; The men protested volubly,
of course, all together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do have my own trade to keep up, and if I must
spend my days asking questions for you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mistress al&rsquo;Meara, this woman is the first person I
have found who&rsquo;s actually seen Amathera since she was raised&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve, I&rsquo;ll hardly be able to <em>find</em> a
rumor tomorrow, much less trace it, if I spend the night playing
at&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She let them argue themselves out. When they began to
trail off, obviously thinking her convinced, she said, &ldquo;Since we
have nowhere else to keep the Seanchan woman, she will have to
sleep with us. Elayne, will you ask Rendra to have a pallet made
up? On the floor will do nicely.&rdquo; Egeanin glanced at her, but said
nothing.</p>

<p>The men were neatly boxed; either they refused
flatly, and openly broke their word to do as Nynaeve said, or else
argued on, sounding as if they were whining. They glowered and
spluttered&mdash;and acquiesced.</p>

<p>Rendra was clearly surprised they requested only a
pallet, but accepted the tale that Egeanin feared to risk the
streets at night. She did look miffed when Thom seated himself in
the hall beside their door. &ldquo;Those fellows, they did not get inside
however hard they tried. I told you the soup kitchen would take
them away, yes? Guests at the Three Plum Court have no need for the
bodyguards on their rooms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure not,&rdquo; Elayne told her, gently trying to
push her out with the door. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that Thom and the others do
worry so. You know how men are.&rdquo; Thom shot her a hawkish stare
beneath those thick white eyebrows, but Rendra sniffed, agreeing
that she did indeed know, and let Elayne shut the door.</p>

<p>Nynaeve immediately turned to Egeanin, who was
spreading her pallet on the far side of the bed. &ldquo;Take off your
clothes, Seanchan. I want to be sure you don&rsquo;t have another knife
hidden away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egeanin calmly stood and undressed down to her linen
shift. Nynaeve searched through her dress thoroughly, then insisted
on searching Egeanin as well, and none too gently. Finding nothing
did not seem to soothe her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hands behind your back, Seanchan. Elayne, bind
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve, I don&rsquo;t think she&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bind her with the Power, Elayne,&rdquo; Nynaeve said
roughly, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll cut strips from her dress and bind her hands and
heels. You remember how she handled those fellows in the street.
Probably her own hirelings. She could probably kill us in our sleep
with her bare hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, Nynaeve, with Thom outside&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s Seanchan! Seanchan, Elayne!&rdquo; She sounded as if
she hated the dark-haired woman for a personal wrong, which made no
sense. Egwene had been in their hands, but not Nynaeve. The set of
her jaw said she meant to have her way, with the Power or with
ropes if she could find them.</p>

<p>Egeanin had already placed her wrists together in the
small of her back, compliant if not meek. Elayne wove a flow of Air
around them and tied it off; at least it would be more comfortable
than bindings cut out of her dress. Egeanin flexed her arms
slightly, testing the bonds she could not see, and shivered. She
could as easily have broken steel chains. Shrugging, she laid
herself down awkwardly on the pallet and turned her back to
them.</p>

<p>Nynaeve began undoing her own dress. &ldquo;Let me have the
ring, Elayne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure, Nynaeve?&rdquo; She looked at Egeanin in a
significant manner. The woman seemed to be paying no attention to
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll not go running to betray us tonight.&rdquo; Pausing
to pull the dress over her head, Nynaeve sat on the edge of the bed
in her thin silk Taraboner shift to roll down her stockings.
&ldquo;Tonight is the agreed night. Egwene will expect one of us, and it
is my turn. She will be worried if neither of us appears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne fished the leather cord around her neck out of
the bosom of her dress. The stone ring, all flecks and stripes in
blue and brown and red, lay snuggled against the golden serpent
eating its own tail. Unknotting the string long enough to hand the
<em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> to Nynaeve, she retied and replaced it.
Nynaeve strung the stone <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> with her own Great
Serpent ring and Lan&rsquo;s heavy gold ring, let them hang between her
breasts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me an hour after you are certain I&rsquo;m asleep,&rdquo;
she said, stretching out atop the blue coverlet. &ldquo;It should take no
longer than that. And keep an eye on her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can she do bound, Nynaeve?&rdquo; Elayne hesitated
before adding, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she would try to harm us if she were
loose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare!&rdquo; Nynaeve raised her head to glare at
Egeanin&rsquo;s back, then lay back on the pillows again. &ldquo;An hour,
Elayne.&rdquo; Closing her eyes, she wriggled to make herself more
comfortable. &ldquo;That should be more than enough,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>

<p>Hiding a yawn behind her hand, Elayne brought the low
stool to the foot of the bed, where she could watch Nynaeve, and
Egeanin, too, though that hardly seemed necessary. The woman lay
huddled on her pallet with her knees up, hands securely fastened.
It had been a strangely tiring day considering that they had never
left the inn. Nynaeve was already muttering softly in her sleep.
With her elbows jutting out.</p>

<p>Egeanin lifted her head and looked over her shoulder.
&ldquo;She hates me, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go to sleep.&rdquo; Elayne stifled another yawn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure of yourself,&rdquo; she said firmly.
&ldquo;You are taking this very calmly. How can you be so calm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Calm?&rdquo; The other woman&rsquo;s hands moved involuntarily,
twisting at her Air-woven bonds. &ldquo;I am so terrified I could weep.&rdquo;
She did not sound it. Yet it sounded the simple truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t harm you, Egeanin.&rdquo; Whatever Nynaeve
wanted, she would see to that. &ldquo;Go to sleep.&rdquo; After a moment
Egeanin&rsquo;s head lowered.</p>

<p>An hour. It was right not to worry Egwene needlessly,
but she wished that hour could be spent on their problem instead of
wandering uselessly in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. If they could not
find out whether Amathera was prisoner or captive&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Set
that aside; I won&rsquo;t puzzle it out here</em>. Once they did find
out, how could they get inside the palace with all those soldiers
about, and the Civil Watch, not to mention Liandrin and the
others?</p>

<p>Nynaeve had started snoring softly, a habit she
denied even more heatedly than she did flinging her elbows about.
Egeanin appeared to be taking the long, slow breaths of deep sleep.
Yawning into the back of her hand, Elayne shifted on the hard
wooden seat and began planning how to sneak into the Panarch&rsquo;s
Palace.</p>
