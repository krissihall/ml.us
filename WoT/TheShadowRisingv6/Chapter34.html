<h4><em>He Who Comes With the Dawn</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
dawn shadows shortened and paled as Rand and Mat
jogged across the barren, still-dark valley floor, leaving
fog-shrouded Rhuidean behind. The dry air hinted at heat to come,
but the slight breeze actually felt cool to Rand, with no coat.
That would not last; full blistering daylight would be on them soon
enough. They hurried as best they could in the hope of beating it,
but he did not think they would. Their best was not very fast.</p>

<p>Mat trotted in a pained shamble; a dark smear fanned
across half his face, and his coat hung open, revealing his unlaced
shirt stuck to his chest by more drying blood. Sometimes he
gingerly touched the thick weal around his throat, nearly black
now, growling under his breath, and he stumbled often, catching
himself with the odd, black-hafted spear and clutching at his head.
He did not complain, though, which was a bad sign. Mat was a great
complainer at small discomforts; if he was silent now, it meant he
was in real pain.</p>

<p>The old, half-healed wound in Rand&rsquo;s side felt as
though something were boring into it, and the gashes on his face
and head burned, yet lumbering along, half-hunched over his aching
side, he hardly thought of his own hurts. He was all too conscious
of the sun rising behind him and the Aiel waiting on the bare
mountainside ahead. There was water and shade up there, and help
for Mat. The rising sun behind, and the Aiel ahead. Dawn and the
Aiel.</p>

<p>He Who Comes With the Dawn. That Aes Sedai he had
seen, or dreamed he had seen, before Rhuidean&mdash;she had spoken
as if she had the Foretelling. <em>He will bind you together. He
will take you back, and destroy you</em>. Words delivered like
prophecy. Destroy them. Prophecy said he would Break the World
again. The idea horrified him. Perhaps he could escape that part,
at least, but war, death and destruction already welled up in his
footsteps. Tear was the first place in what seemed a very long time
where he had not left chaos behind, men dying and villages
burning.</p>

<p>He found himself wishing he could climb on Jeade&rsquo;en
and run as fast as the stallion could carry him. It was not the
first time. <em>But I can&rsquo;t run</em>, he thought. I <em>have it to
do because there isn&rsquo;t anybody else who can. I do it, or the Dark
One wins</em>. A hard bargain, but the only one there was. <em>But
why would I destroy the Aiel? How?</em></p>

<p>That last thought chilled him. It was too much like
accepting that he would, that he should. He did not want to harm
the Aiel. &ldquo;Light,&rdquo; he said harshly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to destroy
anybody.&rdquo; His mouth felt lined with dust again.</p>

<p>Mat glanced at him silently. A wary look.</p>

<p><em>I am not mad yet</em>, Rand thought grimly.</p>

<p>Upslope the Aiel were stirring in the three camps.
The cold fact was, he needed them. That was why he had begun to
contemplate this, back when he first discovered that the Dragon
Reborn and He Who Comes With the Dawn might well be one and the
same. He needed people he could trust, people who followed from
something besides fear of him, or greed for power. People who did
not mean to use him for their own ends. He had done what was
required, and now he would use them. Because he had to. He was not
mad yet&mdash;he did not think he was&mdash;but many would think
so before he was done.</p>

<p>Full, glaring sunlight overtook them before they
began to scramble up Chaendaer, heat like a club. Rand climbed the
uneven slope as fast as he could manage, with its dips and rises
and rough outcrops; his throat had forgotten its last drink, and
the sun dried his shirt as fast as sweat could moisten it. Mat
needed no urging, either. There was water up there. Bair stood in
front of the Wise One&rsquo;s low tents, a waterbag in her hands,
glistening with condensation. Licking cracked lips, Rand was sure
he could see the glisten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is he? What have you done to him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The roar stopped Rand in his tracks. The flame-haired
man, Couladin, stood atop a thick thumb of granite jutting out from
the mountain. Others of the Shaido clan clustered around its base,
all looking at Rand and Mat. Some were veiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you talking about?&rdquo; Rand called back. His
voice croaked with thirst.</p>

<p>Couladin&rsquo;s eyes bulged in outrage. &ldquo;Muradin,
wetlander! He entered two days before you, yet you come out first.
He could not fail where you survive! You must have murdered
him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand thought he heard a shout from the Wise One&rsquo;s
tents, but before he could even blink, Couladin uncoiled like a
snake, casting a spear straight at him. Two more streaked behind it
from the Aiel at the base of the granite thumb.</p>

<p>Instinctively Rand snatched for <em>saidin</em> and
the flame-carved sword. The blade whirled in his hands&mdash;Whirlwind on the Mountain; aptly named&mdash;slicing a pair of
spear shafts in two. Mat&rsquo;s spinning black spear just barely knocked
the third aside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Proof!&rdquo; Couladin howled. &ldquo;They entered Rhuidean
armed! It is forbidden! Look at the blood on them! They have
murdered Muradin!&rdquo; Even as he spoke he hurled another spear, and
this time it was one of a dozen.</p>

<p>Rand flung himself aside, just conscious of Mat
leaping the other way, yet even before they hit the ground the
spears came together where Rand had been standing, bouncing off
each other. Rolling to his feet, he found the spears all stuck into
the stony ground. In a perfect circle surrounding the spot he had
jumped from. For a moment even Couladin seemed stunned to
stillness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Bair shouted, running down into the
motionless instant. Her long bulky skirt impeded her no more than
her age; she bounded down the slope like a girl for all her white
hair, and a girl in a fury at that. &ldquo;The peace of Rhuidean,
Couladin!&rdquo; Her thin voice was an iron rod. &ldquo;Twice you have tried to
break it now. Once more, and you are outlawed! My word on it! You,
and anyone else who lifts a hand!&rdquo; She skidded to a halt in front
of Rand, facing the Shaido with the water bag raised as if she
meant to bludgeon them with it. &ldquo;Let who doubts me raise a
weapon! That one will be deprived of shade according to the
Agreement of Rhuidean, denied hold or stand or tent. His own sept
will hunt him as a wild beast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some of the Shaido hastily unveiled their faces&mdash;some of them&mdash;but Couladin was not dissuaded. &ldquo;They
are armed, Bair! They went armed to Rhuidean! That is&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; Bair shook a fist at him. &ldquo;You dare speak
of weapons? You who would break the Peace of Rhuidean, and kill
with your face bare to the world? They took no weapon with them; I
attest to it.&rdquo; Deliberately she turned her back, but the gaze she
swept across Rand and Mat was hardly softer than what she had given
Couladin. She grimaced at Mat&rsquo;s strange sword-bladed spear,
muttering, &ldquo;Did you find that in Rhuidean, boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was given it, <em>old woman</em>,&rdquo; Mat growled
back hoarsely. &ldquo;I paid for it, and I mean to keep it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sniffed. &ldquo;You both look as if you had rolled in
knifegrass. What&mdash;? No, you can tell me later.&rdquo; Eyeing Rand&rsquo;s
Power-wrought sword, she shivered. &ldquo;Rid yourself of that. And show
them the signs before that fool Couladin tries to whip them up
again. With this temper on him, he would take his whole clan into
outlawry without blinking. Quickly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment he gaped at her. Signs? Then he
remembered what Rhuarc had shown him once, the mark of a man who
had survived Rhuidean. Letting the sword vanish, he unlaced his
left shirt cuff and pushed the sleeve back to his elbow.</p>

<p>Around his forearm wound a shape like that on the
Dragon banner, a sinuous golden-maned form scaled in scarlet and
gold. He expected it, of course, but it was still a shock. The
thing looked like a part of his skin, as though that nonexistent
creature itself had settled into him. His arm felt no different,
yet the scales sparkled in the sunlight like polished metal; it
seemed if he touched that golden mane atop his wrist, he would
surely feel each hair.</p>

<p>He thrust his arm into the air as soon as it was
bare, high so Couladin and his people could see. Mutters rose among
the Shaido, and Couladin snarled wordlessly. The numbers around the
granite outcrop were swelling as more Shaido came running from
their tents. Rhuarc stood with Heirn and his Jindo a little
upslope; they watched the Shaido warily, and Rand with an air of
expectation his uplifted arm did not lessen. Lan stood halfway
between the two groups, hands resting on his sword hilt, face a
thunderhead.</p>

<p>Just as Rand began to realize the Aiel wanted
something more, Egwene and the other three Wise Women reached him,
scrambling down the mountain. The Aiel women looked out of
countenance at having to hurry and every bit as angry as Bair had
been. Amys directed her glares at Couladin, while sun-haired
Melaine stared blazingly at Rand. Seana just seemed ready to chew
rocks. Egwene, with a scarf wrapped around her hair and spread over
her shoulders, stared at Mat and him half in consternation and half
as though she had expected never to see them again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fool man,&rdquo; Bair muttered. &ldquo;<em>All</em> of the
signs.&rdquo; Tossing the waterbag to Mat, she seized Rand&rsquo;s right arm
and stripped back his sleeve, exposing a mirror twin of the
creature on his left forearm. Her breath caught, then came out in a
long sigh. She seemed balanced on a razor edge between relief and
apprehension. There was no mistaking it; she had hoped for the
second marking, yet it made her afraid. Amys and the other two Wise
Women echoed her sign almost exactly. It was odd to see Aiel
fearful.</p>

<p>Rand almost laughed. Not that he was amused. &ldquo;Twice
and twice shall he be marked.&rdquo; That was what the Prophecies of the
Dragon said. A heron branded into each palm, and now these. One of
the peculiar creatures&mdash;Dragons, the Prophecy called them&mdash;was supposed to be &ldquo;for remembrance lost.&rdquo; Rhuidean had
certainly supplied that, the lost history of the Aiel&rsquo;s origins.
And the other was for &ldquo;the price he must pay.&rdquo; <em>How soon must I
pay it?</em> he wondered. <em>And how many have to pay with
me?</em> Others always had to, even when he tried to pay alone.</p>

<p>Apprehensive or not, Bair did not pause before
shoving that arm above his head, too, and proclaiming loudly,
&ldquo;Behold what has never been seen before. A <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> has
been chosen, a chief of chiefs. Born of a Maiden, he has come with
the dawn from Rhuidean, according to prophecy, to unite the Aiel!
The fulfillment of prophecy has begun!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reactions of the other Aiel were nothing like
what Rand envisioned. Couladin stared down at him, even more
hatefully than before if that was possible, then leaped from the
outcrop and stalked up the slope to vanish into the Shaido tents.
The Shaido themselves began to disperse, glancing at Rand with
unreadable faces before drifting back to their tents. Heirn and the
warriors of the Jindo sept, hardly hesitating, did the same. In
moments only Rhuarc remained, his eyes troubled. Lan went over to
the clan chief; from his face, the Warder would just as soon not
have seen Rand at all. Rand was not sure what he had expected, but
surely something other than this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn me!&rdquo; Mat muttered. He seemed to realize for the
first time that he had the waterbag in his hands. Jerking the plug
free, he held the hide bag high, letting nearly as much splash over
his face as into his mouth. When he finally lowered it, he looked
at the markings on Rand&rsquo;s arms again and shook his head, repeating,
&ldquo;Burn me!&rdquo; as he pushed the sloshing bag at him.</p>

<p>Rand stared at the Aiel in consternation, but he was
more than glad to drink. The first gulps hurt his throat, it was so
dry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happened to you?&rdquo; Egwene demanded. &ldquo;Did Muradin
attack you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is forbidden to speak of what occurs in
Rhuidean,&rdquo; Bair said sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not Muradin,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Moiraine? I
expected her to be the first to meet us.&rdquo; He rubbed his face; black
flakes of dried blood came off on his hand. &ldquo;For once, I won&rsquo;t care
if she asks before she Heals me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me either,&rdquo; Mat said hoarsely. He swayed, holding
himself up with his spear, and pressed the heel of his palm against
his forehead. &ldquo;My brain is spinning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene grimaced. &ldquo;She is still in Rhuidean, I
suppose. But if you have finally come out, maybe she will, as well.
She left right after you. And Aviendha. You&rsquo;ve all been gone so
long. &rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moiraine went to Rhuidean?&rdquo; Rand said incredulously.
&ldquo;And <em>Aviendha</em>? Why did&mdash;&rdquo; Abruptly he registered what
else she had said. &ldquo;What do you mean, &lsquo;so long&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the seventh day,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The seventh day
since you all went down into the valley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The waterbag fell from his hands. Seana snatched it
up again before more than a little of its contents, so precious in
the Waste, could trickle away down the stony slope. Rand barely
noticed. Seven days. Anything could have happened in seven days.
<em>They could be catching up to me, figuring out what I&rsquo;m
planning. I have to move. Fast. I have to keep ahead of them. I
haven&rsquo;t come this far to fail</em>.</p>

<p>They were all staring at him, even Rhuarc and Mat,
concern writ large on their faces. And caution. No wonder in that.
Who could say what he might do, or how sane he still was? Only Lan
did not change his stony scowl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you that was Aviendha, Rand. Bare as she was
born.&rdquo; Mat&rsquo;s voice had a painful rasp to it, and his legs looked
none too steady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long before Moiraine comes back?&rdquo; Rand asked. If
she had gone in at the same time, she should return soon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she has not returned by the tenth day,&rdquo; Bair
replied, &ldquo;she will not. No one has ever returned after ten
days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another three days, maybe. Three more days when he
had already lost seven. <em>Let them come, now. I will not
fail!</em> He barely kept a snarl from his face. &ldquo;You can channel.
One of you can, anyway. I saw how you flung Couladin about. Will
you Heal Mat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amys and Melaine exchanged looks he could only call
rueful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our paths have gone other ways,&rdquo; Amys said
regretfully. &ldquo;There are Wise Ones who could do what you ask, after
a fashion, but we are not among them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he snapped angrily. &ldquo;You can
channel like Aes Sedai. Why can&rsquo;t you Heal like them? You did not
want him to go to Rhuidean in the first place. Do you think you can
let him die from it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll survive,&rdquo; Mat said, but his eyes were tight
with suffering.</p>

<p>Egwene put a hand on Rand&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Not all Aes Sedai
can Heal very well,&rdquo; she said in a soothing voice. &ldquo;The best
Healers are all Yellow Ajah. Sheriam, the Mistress of Novices,
cannot Heal anything much more serious than a bruise or a small
cut. No two women can have exactly the same Talents or skills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her tone irritated him. He was not some pettish child
to be smoothed down. He frowned at the Wise Ones. Could not or
would not, Mat and he would have to wait for Moiraine. If she had
not been killed by that bubble of evil, by those dust creatures. It
must have dissipated by now; there had been an end to the one in
Tear. <em>They wouldn&rsquo;t have stopped her. She could channel her way
through them. She knows what she&rsquo;s doing; she doesn&rsquo;t have to
figure it out an inch at a time the way I do</em>. But then why was
she not back? Why had she gone in the first place, and why had he
not seen her? Foolish question. A hundred people could have been in
Rhuidean without being seen. Too many questions, and no answers
until she did return, he suspected. If then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are herbs and ointments,&rdquo; Seana said. &ldquo;Come
out of the sun, and. we will tend your injuries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out of the sun,&rdquo; Rand muttered. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He was being
boorish but he did not care. Why had Moiraine gone into Rhuidean?
He did not trust her to stop pushing him in the direction she
thought best, and the Dark One take his opinions. If she was in
there, could she have affected what he saw? Changed it some way? If
she even suspected what he planned&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He started toward the Jindo tents&mdash;Couladin&rsquo;s
people were not likely to offer him a resting place&mdash;but Amys
turned him toward the flat farther up where the Wise Ones&rsquo; tents
stood. &ldquo;They might not be comfortable with you among them just,
yet,&rdquo; she said, Rhuarc, failing in beside her, nodded
agreement.</p>

<p>Melaine glanced at Lan. &ldquo;This is no business of
yours, <em>Aan&rsquo;allein</em>. You and Rhuarc take Matrim and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Rand broke in. &ldquo;I want them with me.&rdquo; Partly it
was because he wanted answers from the clan chief, and partly it
was sheer stubbornness. These Wise Ones were all set to guide him
around on a leash, just like Moiraine. He was not about to put up
with it. They looked at one another, then nodded as if acceding to
a request. If they thought he would be a good boy because they gave
him a sweet, they were mistaken. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have thought you would be
with Moiraine,&rdquo; he said to Lan, ignoring the Wise Ones and their
nods.</p>

<p>A flash of embarrassment crossed the Warder&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;The Wise Ones managed to hide her going until nearly sunset,&rdquo; he
said stiffly. &ldquo;Then they&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;convinced me following would serve
no purpose. They said even if I did, I could not find her until she
was already on her way out, and she would not need me, then. I am
no longer certain I should have listened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listened!&rdquo; Melaine snorted. Her gold and ivory
bracelets clattered as she adjusted her shawl irritably. &ldquo;Trust a
man to make himself sound reasonable. You would almost certainly
have died, and very likely killed her, too. &rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Melaine and I had to hold him down half the night
before he would listen,&rdquo; Amys said. Her small smile was a touch
amused, a touch wry.</p>

<p>Lan&rsquo;s face might as well have been carved from
thunderclouds. Small wonder, if the Wise Ones had used the Power on
him. What <em>was</em> Moiraine doing in there?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rhuarc,&rdquo; Rand said, &ldquo;how am I supposed to unite the
Aiel? They don&rsquo;t even want to look at me.&rdquo; He raised his bare
forearms for a moment; the Dragons&rsquo; scales glittered in the harsh
sunlight. &ldquo;These say I&rsquo;m He Who Comes With the Dawn, but everybody
practically melted away as soon as I showed the things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is one thing to know prophecy will be fulfilled,
eventually,&rdquo; the clan chief said slowly, &ldquo;another to see that
fulfillment begun before your eyes. It is said you will make the
clans one people again, as long ago, but we have fought one another
almost as long as we have fought the rest of the world. And there
is more, for some of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>He will bind you together, and destroy you</em>.
Rhuarc must have heard that, too. And the other clan chiefs, and
the Wise Ones, if they also had entered that forest of shining
glass columns. If Moiraine had not arranged a special vision for
him. &ldquo;Does everyone see the same things inside those columns,
Rhuarc?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Melaine snapped, eyes like green steel. &ldquo;Be
silent, or send <em>Aan&rsquo;allein</em> and Matrim away. You must go,
too, Egwene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not permitted,&rdquo; Amys said in a just slightly
softer voice, &ldquo;to speak of what occurs within Rhuidean except with
those who have been there.&rdquo; A fraction softer, maybe. &ldquo;Even then,
few speak of it, and seldom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean to change what is permitted and what isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
Rand told them levelly. &ldquo;Become used to it.&rdquo; He caught Egwene
muttering about him needing his ears boxed, and grinned at her.
&ldquo;Egwene can stay, too, since she asked so nicely.&rdquo; She stuck her
tongue out at him, then blushed when she realized what she had
done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Change,&rdquo; Rhuarc said. &ldquo;You know he brings change,
Amys. It is wondering what change, and how, that makes us like
children alone in the dark. Since it must be, let it begin now. No
two clan chiefs I have spoken with have seen through the exactly
same eyes, Rand, or exactly the same things, until the sharing of
water, and the meeting where the Agreement of Rhuidean was made.
Whether it is the same for Wise Ones, I do not know, but I suspect
it is. I think it is a matter of bloodlines. I believe I saw
through the eyes of my ancestors, and you yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amys and the other Wise Ones glowered in grimly
sullen silence. Mat and Egwene wore equally confused stares. Lan
alone seemed not to be listening at all; his eyes looked inward, no
doubt in worry over Moiraine.</p>

<p>Rand felt a little strange himself. Seeing through
his ancestors&rsquo; eyes. He had known for some time that Tam al&rsquo;Thor
was not his real father, that he had been found as a newborn on the
slopes of Dragonmount after the last major battle of the Aiel War.
A newborn with his dead mother, a Maiden of the Spear. He had
claimed Aiel blood in demanding admittance to Rhuidean, but the
fact of it was just now being driven home. His ancestors. Aiel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you saw Rhuidean just begun building, too,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;And the two Aes Sedai. You&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;heard what the one of them
said.&rdquo; <em>He will destroy you</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard.&rdquo; Rhuarc looked resigned, like a man who had
learned his leg had to be cut off. &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand changed the subject. &ldquo;What was &lsquo;the sharing of
water&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The clan chief&rsquo;s eyebrows lifted in surprise. &ldquo;You
did not recognize it? But then, I do not see why you should; you
have not grown up with the histories. According the oldest stories,
from the day the Breaking of the World began until the day we first
entered the Three-fold Land, only one people did not attack us. One
people allowed us water freely when it was needed. It took us long
to discover who they were. That is done with, now. The pledge of
peace was destroyed; the treekillers spat in our faces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cairhien,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking about
Cairhien, and <em>Avendoraldera</em>, and Laman cutting down the
Tree. &rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laman is dead for his punishment,&rdquo; Rhuarc, said in a
flat voice. &ldquo;The oathbreakers are done with.&rdquo; He looked at Rand
sideways. &ldquo;Some, such as Couladin, take it for proof we can trust
no one who is not Aiel. That is a part of why he hates you. A part
of it. He will take your face and blood for lies. Or claim he
does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shook his head. Moiraine sometimes talked of the
complexity of Age Lace, the Pattern of an Age, woven by the Wheel
of Time from the thread of human lives. If the ancestors of the
Cairhienin had not allowed the Aiel to have water three thousand
years ago, then Cairhien would never have been given the right to
use the Silk Path across the Waste, with a cutting from
<em>Avendesora</em> for a pledge. No pledge, and King Laman would
have had no Tree to cut down; there would have been no Aiel War;
and he could not have been born on the side of Dragonmount to be
carried off and raised in the Two Rivers. How many more points like
that had there been, where a single decision one way or another
affected the weave of the Pattern for thousands of years? A
thousand times a thousand tiny branching points, a thousand times
that many, all twitching the Pattern into a different design. He
himself was a walking branching point, and maybe Mat and Perrin,
too. What they did or did not do would send ripples ahead through
the years, through the Ages.</p>

<p>He looked at Mat, hobbling up the slope with the aid
of his spear, head down and eyes squinted in pain. <em>The Creator
could not have been thinking, to set the future on the shoulders of
three farmboys. I can&rsquo;t drop it. I have to carry the load, whatever
the cost</em>.</p>

<p>At the Wise Ones&rsquo; low, wall-less tents, the women
ducked inside with murmurs about water and shade. They all but
pulled Mat with them; as evidence of how his head and throat hurt,
he not only obeyed, he did so silently.</p>

<p>Rand started to follow, but Lan laid a hand on his
shoulder. &ldquo;Did you see her in there?&rdquo; the Warder asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Lan. I&rsquo;m sorry; I did not. She&rsquo;ll come out safe
if anyone can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan grunted and took his hand away. &ldquo;Watch out for
Couladin, Rand. I have seen his kind before. Ambition burns in his
belly. He would sacrifice the world to achieve it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Aan&rsquo;allein</em> speaks the truth,&rdquo; Rhuarc said.
&ldquo;The Dragons on your arms will not matter if you are dead before
the clan chiefs learn of them. I will make sure some of Heirn&rsquo;s
Jindo are always near you until we reach Cold Rocks. Even then,
Couladin will probably try to make trouble, and the Shaido, at
least, will follow him. Perhaps others, too. The Prophecy of
Rhuidean said you would be raised by those not of the blood, yet
Couladin may not be the only one to see only a wetlander.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will try to watch my back,&rdquo; Rand said dryly. In
the stories, when somebody fulfilled a prophecy, everyone cried
&ldquo;Behold!&rdquo; or some such, and that was that except for dealing with
the villains. Real life did not seem to work that way.</p>

<p>When they entered the tent, Mat was already seated on
a gold-tasseled red cushion with his coat and shirt off. A woman in
a cowled white robe had finished washing the blood from his face
and was just beginning on his chest. Amys gripped a stone mortar
between her knees, blending some ointment with a pestle, while Bair
and Seana had their heads together over herbs brewing in a pot of
hot water.</p>

<p>Melaine grimaced at Lan and Rhuarc then fixed Rand
with cool green eyes. &ldquo;Strip to the waist,&rdquo; she said curtly. &ldquo;The
cuts on your head do not seem too bad, but let me see what has you
hunched over.&rdquo; She struck a small brass gong, and another
white-robed woman ducked in at the back of the tent, a steaming
silver basin in her hands and cloths over her arm.</p>

<p>Rand took a seat on a cushion, making himself sit up
straight. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing to worry yourself about,&rdquo; he assured her.
The second woman in white knelt gracefully by his side and,
resisting his efforts to take the damp cloth she wrung out in the
basin, began gently washing his face. He wondered who she was. She
looked Aiel, but she certainly did not act it. Her gray eyes held a
determined meekness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is an old injury,&rdquo; Egwene told the sun-haired
Wise One. &ldquo;Moiraine has never been able to Heal it properly.&rdquo; The
look she gave Rand said common courtesy should have made him tell
as much. From the glances that passed among the Wise Ones, though,
he thought she had said more than enough already. A wound Aes Sedai
could not Heal; that was a puzzle to them. Moiraine seemed to know
more about him than he knew about himself, and he had a hard time
dealing with her. Maybe it would go easier with the Wise Ones if
they had to guess about him.</p>

<p>Mat winced as Amys began rubbing her ointment into
the slashes on his chest. If it felt anything like it smelled, Rand
thought he had cause to wince. Bair shoved a silver cup at Mat.
&ldquo;Drink, <em>young man</em>. Timsin root and silverleaf will help
your headaches if anything can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not hesitate before gulping it down; a shudder
and a twisted face followed. &ldquo;Tastes like the inside of my boots.&rdquo;
But he gave her a seated bow, formal enough for a Tairen except for
his being shirtless, and only spoiled a bit by his sudden grin. &ldquo;I
thank you, Wise One. And I won&rsquo;t ask if you added anything just to
give it that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;memorable&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;taste.&rdquo; Bair and Seana&rsquo;s soft
laughter might have come because they had or because they
had not, but it seemed that as usual Mat had found a way to get on
the good of side of the women. Even Melaine gave him a brief
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rhuarc,&rdquo; Rand said, &ldquo;if Couladin thinks to make
difficulties, I need to jump ahead of him. How do I go about
telling the other clan chiefs? About me. About these.&rdquo; He shifted
his Dragon-twined arms. The white-robed woman at his side, cleaning
the long gash in his hair now, deliberately avoided looking at
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no set formality,&rdquo; Rhuarc said. &ldquo;How could
there be, for a thing that will happen only once? When there must
be a meeting between clan chiefs, there are places where something
like the Peace of Rhuidean holds. The closest to Cold Rocks, the
closest to Rhuidean, is Alcair Dal. You could show proofs to the
clan and sept chiefs there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Al&rsquo;cair Dal</em>?&rdquo; Mat said, giving it a subtly
different sound. &ldquo;The Golden Bowl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rhuarc nodded. &ldquo;A round canyon, though there is
nothing golden about it. There is a ledge at one end, and a man who
stands there can be heard by anyone in the canyon without raising
his voice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand frowned at the Dragons on his forearms. He was
not the only one to have been marked in some way in Rhuidean. Mat
no longer spoke a few words of the Old Tongue now and then without
knowing what he was saying. He understood, since Rhuidean, though
he did not appear to realize it. Egwene was watching Mat.
Thoughtfully. She had spent too much time with Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rhuarc, can you send messengers out to the clan
chiefs?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How long will it take to ask them all to Alcair
Dal? What will it take to make sure they come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Messengers will take weeks, and more weeks for
everyone to gather.&rdquo; Rhuarc&rsquo;s gesture took in all four Wise Ones.
&ldquo;They can speak to every clan chief in his dreams in one night, to
every sept chief. And every Wise One, to make sure no man takes it
for just a dream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I appreciate your confidence that we can move
mountains, shade of my heart,&rdquo; Amys said wryly, settling herself
beside Rand with her ointment, &ldquo;but that does not make it so. It
would take several nights to do what you suggest, with little rest
in them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand caught her hand as she started to rub the
sharp-smelling mixture on his cheek. &ldquo;Will you do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you so eager to destroy us?&rdquo; she demanded, then
bit her lip vexedly as the white-cowled woman on Rand&rsquo;s other side
started.</p>

<p>Melaine clapped her hands twice. &ldquo;Leave us,&rdquo; she said
sharply, and the women in white bowed their way out with their
basins and cloths.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You goad me like a needleburr next to the skin,&rdquo;
Amys told Rand bitterly. &ldquo;Whatever they are told, those women will
talk now of what they should not know.&rdquo; She pulled her hand free,
began rubbing in the ointment with perhaps more energy than was
necessary. It stung worse than it smelled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not mean to goad you,&rdquo; Rand said, &ldquo;but there is
no time. The Forsaken are loose, Amys, and if they find out where I
am, or what I plan&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; The Aiel women did not seem surprised.
Had they known already? &ldquo;Nine still live. Too many, and those that
don&rsquo;t want to kill me think they can use me. I have no time. If I
knew a way to bring all the clan chiefs here now, and make them
accept me, I&rsquo;d use it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it you plan?&rdquo; Amys voice was as stony as her
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you ask&mdash;tell&mdash;the chiefs to come
to Alcair Dal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a long moment she met his stare. When she finally
nodded, it was grudging.</p>

<p>Begrudged or not, some of the tension went out of
him. There was no way to win back seven lost days, but perhaps he
could avoid losing more. Moiraine, still in Rhuidean with Aviendha,
held him here yet, though. He could not simply abandon her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You knew my mother,&rdquo; he said. Egwene leaned forward,
as intent as he, and Mat shook his head.</p>

<p>Amys&rsquo;s hand paused on his face. &ldquo;I knew her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me about her. Please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shifted her attention to the slash above his ear;
if a frown could have Healed, he would not have needed her
ointment. Finally she said, &ldquo;Shaiel&rsquo;s story, as I know it, begins
when I was still <em>Far Dareis Mai</em>, more than a year before I
gave up the spear. A number of us had ranged almost to the
Dragonwall together. One day we saw a woman, a golden-haired young
wetlander, in silks, with packhorses and a fine mare to ride. A man
we would have killed, of course, but she had no weapon beyond a
simple knife at her belt. Some wanted to run her back to the
Dragonwall naked&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Egwene blinked; she seemed continually
surprised at how hard the Aiel were. Amys continued without pause.
&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she seemed to be searching determinedly for something.
Curious, we followed, day by day, without letting her see. Her
horses died, her food ran out, her water, but she did not turn
back. She stumbled on afoot, until finally she fell and could not
rise. We decided to give her water, and ask her story. She was
near death, and it was a full day before she could speak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her name was Shaiel?&rdquo; Rand said when she hesitated.
&ldquo;Where was she from? Why did she come here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shaiel,&rdquo; Bair said, &ldquo;was the name she took for
herself. She never gave another in the time I knew her. In the Old
Tongue it would mean the Woman Who Is Dedicated.&rdquo; Mat nodded
agreement, not seeming to realize what he had done; Lan eyed him
thoughtfully over a silver cup of water. &ldquo;There was a bitterness in
Shaiel, in the beginning,&rdquo; she finished.</p>

<p>Sitting back on her heels beside Rand, Amys nodded.
&ldquo;She spoke of a child abandoned, a son she loved. A husband she did
not love. Where, she would not say. I do not think she ever forgave
herself for leaving the child. She would tell little beyond what
she had to. It was for us she had been searching, for Maidens of
the Spear. An Aes Sedai called Gitara Moroso, who had the
Foretelling, had told her that disaster would befall her land and
her people, perhaps the world, unless she went to dwell among the
Maidens of the Spear, telling no one of her going. She must become
a Maiden, and she could not return to her own land until the
Maidens had gone to Tar Valon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head wonderingly. &ldquo;You must understand
how it sounded, then. The Maidens go to Tar Valon? No Aiel had
crossed the Dragonwall since the day we first reached the
Three-fold Land. It would be another four years before Laman&rsquo;s
crime brought us into the wetlands. And certainly no one not Aiel
had ever become a Maiden of the Spear. Some of us thought her mad
from the sun. But she had a stubborn will, and somehow we found
ourselves agreeing to let her try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gitara Moroso. An Aes Sedai with the Foretelling.
Somewhere he had heard that name, but where? And he had a brother.
A half-brother. Growing up, he had wondered what it would be like
to have a brother or a sister. Who, and where? But Amys was going
on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Almost every girl dreams of becoming a Maiden, and
learns at least the rudiments of bow and spear, of fighting with
hands and feet. Even so, those who take the final step and wed the
spear discover they know nothing. It was harder for Shaiel. The bow
she knew well, but she had never run as far as a mile, or lived on
what she could find. A ten-year-old girl could beat her, and she
did not even know what plants indicate water. Yet she persevered.
In a year she had spoken her vows to the spear, become a Maiden,
adopted into the Chumai sept of the Taardad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And eventually she had gone to Tar Valon with the
Maidens, to die on the slopes of Dragonmount. Half an answer, and
leaving new questions. If he could only have seen her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have something of her in your features,&rdquo; Seana
said as though reading his thoughts. She had settled herself
cross-legged with a small silver cup of wine. &ldquo;Less of Janduin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Janduin? My father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Seana said. &ldquo;He was clan chief of the Taardad,
then, the youngest in memory. Yet he had a way to him, a power.
People listened to him, and would follow him, even those not of his
clan. He ended the blood feud between Taardad and Nakai after two
hundred years, and made alliance not only with the Nakai, but the
Reyn, and the Reyn were not far short of blood feud. He very nearly
ended the feud between Shaarad and Goshien, as well, and might have
had Laman not cut down the Tree. Young as he was, it was he who led
the Taardad and Nakai, the Reyn and Shaarad, to seek Laman&rsquo;s
bloodprice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Was. So he was dead now, too. Egwene wore sympathy on
her face. Rand ignored it; he did not want sympathy. How could he
feel loss, for people he had never known? Yet he did. &ldquo;How did
Janduin die?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Wise Ones exchanged hesitant glances. At last
Amys said, &ldquo;It was the beginning of the third year of the search
for Laman when Shaiel found herself with child. By the laws, she
should have returned to the Three-fold Land. A Maiden is forbidden
to carry the spear while she carries a child. But Janduin could
forbid her nothing; had she asked the moon on a necklace, he would
have tried to give it to her. So she stayed, and in the last fight,
before Tar Valon, she was lost, and the child was lost. Janduin
could not forgive himself for not making her obey the law.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He gave up his place as clan chief,&rdquo; Bair said. &ldquo;No
one had ever done that before. He was told it could not be done,
but he simply walked away. He went north with the young men, to
hunt Trollocs and Myrddraal in the Blight. It is a thing wild young
men do, and Maidens with less sense than goats. Those who returned
said he was killed by a man, though. They said Janduin claimed this
man looked like Shaiel, and he would not raise his spear when the
man ran him through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dead, then. Both dead. He would never lose his love
for Tam, never stop thinking of him as father, but he wished he
could have seen Janduin and Shaiel, just once.</p>

<p>Egwene tried to comfort him, of course, the way women
did. There was no use trying to make her understand that what he
had lost was something he had never had. For memories of parents he
had Tam al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s quiet laugh, and dimmer remembrance of Kari
al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s gentle hands. That was as much as any man could want or
need. She seemed disappointed, even a little upset with him, and
the Wise Ones appeared to share the feeling to one degree or
another, from Bair&rsquo;s openly disapproving frown to Melaine&rsquo;s sniff
and ostentatious shifting of her shawl. Women never understood.
Rhuarc and Lan and Mat did; they left him alone, as he wanted.</p>

<p>For some reason he did not feel like eating when
Melaine had food brought, so he went to lie at the edge of the
tent, with one of the cushions under his elbow, where he could
watch the slope, and the fog-shrouded city. The sun blasted the
valley and the surrounding mountains, burning the shadows. The air
that eddied into the tent seemed to come from an open oven.</p>

<p>After a time Mat came over, wearing a clean shirt. He
sat beside Rand without speaking, peering into the valley below,
the strange spear propped on his knee. Now and again he felt at the
cursive script carved into the black haft.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is your head?&rdquo; Rand asked, and Mat jumped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t hurt anymore.&rdquo; He jerked his
fingers away from the carving, folded his hands deliberately in his
lap. &ldquo;Not as much, anyway. Whatever that was they mixed up, it did
the trick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He fell silent again, and Rand let him. He did not
want to talk, either. He could almost feel time passing, grains of
sand in an hourglass dropping one by one, ever so slowly. But
everything seemed to tremble, too, the sands ready to explode in a
torrent. Foolish. He was just being affected by the shimmering heat
haze rising from the mountain&rsquo;s bare rock. The clan chiefs could
not reach Alcair Dal one day sooner if Moiraine appeared before him
that instant. They were only a part anyway, and maybe the least
important part. A little while later he noticed Lan squatting
easily atop the same granite outcrop Couladin had used, paying no
mind to the sun. The Warder was watching the valley, too. Another
man who did not want to talk.</p>

<p>Rand refused a midday meal, too, though Egwene and
the Wise Ones took turns trying to make him eat. They seemed to
take his refusal calmly enough, but when he suggested returning to
Rhuidean to look for Moiraine&mdash;and Aviendha, for that matter&mdash;Melaine exploded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You fool man! No man can go twice to Rhuidean. Even
you would not come back alive! Oh, starve if you want to!&rdquo; She
threw half a round loaf of bread at his head. Mat caught it out of
the air and calmly began eating.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you want me to live?&rdquo; Rand asked her. &ldquo;You
know what that Aes Sedai said in front of Rhuidean. I will destroy
you. Why aren&rsquo;t you plotting with Couladin to kill me?&rdquo; Mat choked,
and Egwene planted her fists on her hips, ready to lecture, but
Rand kept his attention on Melaine. Instead of answering, she
glared at him and left the tent.</p>

<p>It was Bair who spoke. &ldquo;Everyone thinks they know the
Prophecy of Rhuidean, but what they know is what Wise Ones and clan
chiefs have told them for generations. Not lies, but not the whole
truth. The truth might break the strongest man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the whole truth?&rdquo; Rand insisted.</p>

<p>She glanced at Mat, then said, &ldquo;In this case, the
whole truth, the truth known only to Wise Ones and clan chiefs
before this, is that you are our doom. Our doom, and our salvation.
Without you, no one of our people will live beyond the Last Battle.
Perhaps not even until the Last Battle. That is prophecy, and
truth. With you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&lsquo;He shall spill out the blood of those who
call themselves Aiel as water on sand, and he shall break them as
dried twigs, yet the remnant of a remnant shall he save, and they
shall live.&rsquo; A hard prophecy, but this has never been a gentle
land.&rdquo; She met his gaze without flinching. A hard land, and a hard
woman.</p>

<p>He rolled back over and returned to watching the
valley. The others left, except for Mat.</p>

<p>In the midafternoon he finally spotted a figure
climbing the mountain, scrambling up wearily. Aviendha. Mat had
been right; she <em>was</em> bare as she was born. And showing some
effects of the sun, too, Aiel or not; it was only her hands and
face that were sun-darkened, and the rest of her looked decidedly
red. He was glad to see her. She disliked him, but only because she
thought he had mistreated Elayne. The simplest of motives. Not for
prophecy or doom, not for the Dragons on his arms or because he was
the Dragon Reborn. For a simple human reason. He almost looked
forward to those cool, challenging stares.</p>

<p>When she saw him, she froze, and there was nothing
cool in her blue-green eyes. Her gaze made the sun seem cold; he
should have been burned to ash on the spot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Rand?&rdquo; Mat said quietly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I
would turn my back on her if I were you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A tired sigh escaped him. Of course. If she had been
into those glass columns, she knew. Bair, Melaine, the others they
had all had years to grow used to it. For Aviendha, it was a fresh
wound with no scab. <em>No wonder she hates me now</em>.</p>

<p>The Wise Ones scurried out to meet Aviendha, hurrying
her away into another tent. The next time Rand saw her she wore a
bulky brown skirt and loose white blouse, with a shawl looped
around her arms. She did not look very happy about the clothes. She
saw him watching, and the fury on her face&mdash;the sheer animal
rage&mdash;was enough to make him turn away.</p>

<p>Shadows were beginning to stretch to the far
mountains by the time Moiraine appeared, falling and staggering
back to her feet as she climbed, as sunburned as Aviendha. He was
startled to see she had no clothes on either. Women were crazy,
that was all.</p>

<p>Lan leaped from the stone outcrop and ran down to
her. Scooping her into his arms, he ran back upslope, perhaps
faster than he had descended, cursing and shouting for the Wise
Ones by turns. Moiraine&rsquo;s head lolled on his shoulder. The Wise
Ones came out to take her, Melaine physically barring his way when
he tried to follow them into the tent. Lan was left stalking up and
down outside, pounding a fist into his hand.</p>

<p>Rand rolled onto his back and stared up at the low
tent roof. Three days saved. He should have felt glad Moiraine and
Aviendha were back and safe, but his relief was all for days saved.
Time was everything. He had to be able to choose his own ground.
Maybe he still could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do now?&rdquo; Mat asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something you should like. I am going to break the
rules.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I meant are you going to get something to eat? Me,
I&rsquo;m hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In spite of himself, Rand laughed. Something to eat?
He did not care if he ever ate again. Mat stared at him as if he
were crazy, and that only made him laugh harder. Not crazy. For the
first time <em>somebody</em> was going to learn what it meant that
he was the Dragon Reborn. He was going to break the rules in a way
<em>no one</em> expected.</p>
