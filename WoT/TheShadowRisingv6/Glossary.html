<p class="drop"><em>A NOTE ON DATES IN THIS GLOSSARY</em>. Three systems
of recording dates have been in general use since the Breaking of
the World. The first recorded years After the Breaking (AB). Since
the years of the Breaking and immediately after were years of
almost total chaos, and since this calendar was adopted a good
hundred years after the end of the Breaking, its starting point was
arbitrarily assigned. At the end of the Trolloc Wars many records
had been lost, so much so that there was argument about the exact
year under the old system. A new calendar was therefore
established, dating from the end of the Wars and celebrating the
supposed freedom of the world from the Trolloc threat. This second
calendar recorded each year as Free Year (FY). After the
disruption, death, and destruction caused by the War of the Hundred
Years, a third calendar came into being. This calendar, of the New
Era (NE), is currently in use.</p>

<br>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Accepted, the</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Young women in training to be Aes Sedai who have reached a
certain level of power and passed certain tests. It normally takes
five to ten years to be raised from novice to the Accepted.
Accepted are somewhat less confined by rules than novices, and are
allowed to choose their own areas of study, within limits. An
Accepted has the right to wear a Great Serpent ring, but only on
the third finger of her left hand. When an Accepted is raised to
the Aes Sedai, she chooses her Ajah, gains the right to wear the
shawl, and may wear the ring on any finger or not at all as
circumstances warrant.</dd>


<dt><strong><em>a&rsquo;dam</em></strong> (<strong>AYE-dam</strong>):</dt>

<dd>A Seanchan device for controlling a woman who can channel,
consisting of a collar and a bracelet linked by a leash all of
silvery metal control. It has no effect on a woman who cannot
channel. <em>See also</em> <em>damane</em>; Seanchan;
<em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>.</dd>


<dt><strong>Adelin</strong> (<strong>AD-ehl-ihn</strong>):</dt>

<dd>A woman of the Jindo sept of the Taardad Aiel. A Maiden of the
Spear who came to the Stone of Tear.</dd>


<dt><strong>Aes Sedai</strong> (<strong>EYEZ
seh-DEYE</strong>):</dt>

<dd>Wielders of the One Power. Since the Time of Madness, all
surviving Aes Sedai are women. Widely distrusted and feared, even
hated, they are blamed by many for the Breaking of the World, and
are thought to meddle in the affairs of nations. At the same time,
few rulers will be without an Aes Sedai adviser, even in lands
where the existence of such a connection must be kept secret. After
some years of channeling the One Power, Aes Sedai take on an
ageless quality, so that an Aes Sedai who is old enough to be a
grandmother may show no signs of age except perhaps a few gray
hairs. <em>See also</em> Ajah; Amyrlin Seat; Time of Madness.</dd>


<dt><strong>Age Lace</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Alternative name for the Pattern. <em>See</em> Pattern of an
Age.</dd>


<dt><strong>Age of Legends</strong>:</dt>

<dd>The Age ended by the War of the Shadow and the Breaking of the
World. A time when Aes Sedai performed wonders now only dreamed of.
<em>See also</em> Wheel of Time; Breaking of the World; War of the
Shadow.</dd>


<dt><strong>Aiel</strong> (<strong>eye-EEL</strong>):</dt>

<dd>The people of the Aiel Waste. Fierce and hardy. Also called
Aielmen. They veil their faces before they kill, giving rise to the
saying &ldquo;acting like a black-veiled Aiel&rdquo; to describe someone who is
being violent. Deadly warriors with weapons or with nothing but
their bare hands, they will not touch a sword. Their pipers play
them into battle with the music of dances, and Aielmen call battle
&ldquo;the dance,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the dance of spears.&rdquo; <em>See also</em> Aiel
warrior societies; Aiel Waste.</dd>


<dt><strong>Aiel War, the</strong>:</dt>

<dd>(976-978 NE) When King Laman of Cairhien cut down
<em>Avendoraldera</em>, several clans of the Aiel crossed the Spine
of the World. They looted and burned the capital city of Cairhien
as well as many other cities and towns, and the conflict extended
into Andor and Tear. The conventional view is that the Aiel were
finally defeated at the Battle of the Shining Walls, before Tar
Valon, but in fact, Laman was killed in that battle, and having
done what they came for, the Aiel recrossed the Spine. <em>See
also</em> <em>Avendoraldera</em>; Cairhien.</dd>


<dt><strong>Aiel warrior societies</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Aiel warriors are all members of one of the warrior societies,
such as the Stone Dogs (<em>Shae&rsquo;en M&rsquo;taal</em>), the Red Shields
(<em>Aethan Dor</em>), the Water Seekers (<em>Duahde Mahdi&rsquo;in</em>)
or the Maidens of the Spear (<em>Far Dareis Mai</em>). Each society
has its own customs, and sometimes specific duties. For example,
Red Shields act as police. Stone Dogs are often used as rear guards
during retreats, while Maidens are often scouts. Aiel clans
frequently raid and battle, but members of the same society will
not fight one another even if their clans do so. Thus there are
always lines of contact between the clans even during open warfare.
<em>See also</em> Aiel; Aiel Waste; <em>Far Dareis Mai</em>.</dd>


<dt><strong>Aiel Waste</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Harsh, rugged, and all-but-waterless land east of the Spine of
the World. Called the Three-fold Land by the Aiel. Few outsiders
enter; the Aiel consider themselves at war with all other peoples
and do not welcome strangers. Only peddlers, gleemen, and the
Tuatha&rsquo;an are allowed safe entry, although Aiel avoid all contact
with the Tuatha&rsquo;an, whom they call &ldquo;the Lost Ones.&rdquo; No maps of the
Waste itself are known to exist.</dd>

<dt><strong>Ajah</strong> (<strong>AH-jah</strong>):</dt>

<dd>Societies among the Aes Sedai, seven in number and designated
by colors: Blue, Red, White, Green, Brown, Yellow, and Gray. All
Aes Sedai except the Amyrlin Seat belong to one. Each follows a
specific philosophy of the use of the One Power and the purposes of
the Aes Sedai. The Red Ajah bends all its energies to finding men
who can channel, and to gentling them. The Brown Ajah forsakes
involvement with the mundane world and dedicates itself to seeking
knowledge, while the White Ajah, largely eschewing both the world
and the value of worldly knowledge, devotes itself to questions of
philosophy and truth. The Green Ajah (called the Battle Ajah during
the Trolloc Wars) holds itself ready for Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don, the Yellow
concentrates on Healing, and Blue sisters involve themselves with
causes and justice. The Gray are mediators, seeking harmony and
consensus. Rumors of a Black Ajah, dedicated to serving the Dark
One, are officially denied.</dd>

World. <em>See also</em> Time of Madness; Hundred Companions,

defeat of the Dark One and the destruction of all Darkfriends.
Founded during the War of the Hundred Years by Lothair Mantelar
(LOH-thayr MAHN-tee-LAHR) to proselytize against an increase in
Darkfriends, they evolved during the war into a completely military
organization, extremely rigid in their beliefs, and completely
certain that only they know the truth and the right. They hate Aes
Sedai, considering them, and any who support or befriend them,
Darkfriends. They are known disparagingly as Whitecloaks. Their
sign is a golden sunburst on a field of white. <em>See also</em>

<dt><strong><em>damane</em></strong>
(<strong>dah-MAHN-ee</strong>):</dt>

<dd>In the Old Tongue, literally &ldquo;leashed one.&rdquo; Seanchan term for
women who can channel and who are, as they see it, properly
controlled by use of <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>. All across Seanchan, young
women are tested each year until the age when the inborn ability to
channel would have manifested itself. Just as with young men found
able to channel (who are executed), <em>damane</em> are removed
from the rolls of citizens, in effect ceasing to exist as people.
Women who can channel but who have not yet been made
<em>damane</em> are called <em>marath&rsquo;damane</em>, literally &ldquo;those
who must be leashed.&rdquo; <em>See also</em> <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>; Seanchan;
<em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>.</dd>


<dt><strong>Damodred, Lord Galadedrid</strong>

power and rewards, and even immortality, when he is freed from his
prison.</dd>


<dt><strong>Dark One</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Most common name, used in every land, for Shai&rsquo;tan. The source
of evil, antithesis of the Creator. Imprisoned by the Creator in
Shayol Ghul at the moment of Creation. An attempt to free him
brought about the War of the Shadow, the tainting of
<em>saidin</em>, the Breaking of the World, and the end of the Age
of Legends.</dd>


<dt><strong>Dark One, naming the</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Saying the true name of the Dark One (Shai&rsquo;tan) draws his
attention, inevitably bringing ill fortune at best, disaster at
worst. For that reason, many euphemisms are used, among them the
Dark One, Father of Lies, Sightblinder, Lord of the Grave, Shepherd
of the Night, Heartsbane, Soulsbane, Heartfang, Old Grim,
Grassburner, and Leafblighter. Darkfriends call him the Great Lord
of the Dark. Someone who seems to be inviting ill fortune is often
said to be &ldquo;naming the Dark One.&rdquo;</dd>


<dt><strong>Daughter-Heir</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Title of the heir to the throne of Andor. The eldest daughter
of the queen succeeds her mother on the throne. Without a surviving

Doman. A sometime collector of antiquities, and a man who pays his
debts.</dd>


<dt><strong>Dragon, false</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Occasionally men claim to be the Dragon Reborn, and sometimes
one of them gains following enough to require an army to put it
down. Some have begun wars that involved many nations. Over the
centuries most of these have been men unable to channel the One
Power, but a few could do so. All, however, either disappeared or
were captured or killed without fulfilling any of the Prophecies
concerning the Rebirth of the Dragon. These men are called false
Dragons. Among those who could channel, the most powerful were
Raolin Darksbane (335-36AB), Yurian Stonebow (circa 1300-1308 AB),
Davian (FY 351), Guaire Amalasan (FY 939-43), and Logain (997 NE).

(sometimes called Wind), Fire, Water, and Spirit, which are called
the Five Powers. Any wielder of the Power will have a greater
degree of strength with one, or possibly two, of these, and lesser
with the others. In the Age of Legends, Spirit was found equally in
men and in women, great ability with Earth and/or Fire was found
much more often among men, with Water and/or Air among women.
Despite exceptions, it was so often so that Earth and Fire came to
be regarded as male Powers, Air and Water as female.</dd>

<dd>Name given to thirteen of the most powerful Aes Sedai of the
Age of Legends, thus among the most powerful ever known, who went
over to the Dark One during the War of the Shadow in return for the
promise of immortality. According to both legend and fragmentary
records, they were imprisoned along with the Dark One when his
prison was resealed. The names given to them are still used to
frighten children. They were: Aginor (AGH-in-nohr), Asmodean

<dd>A former sailor with reasons to avoid Bayle Domon.</dd>


<dt><strong>gentling</strong>:</dt>

<dd>The act, performed by Aes Sedai, of shutting off a male who can
channel from the One Power. This is necessary because any man who
learns to channel will go insane from the taint on <em>saidin</em>
and will almost certainly do horrible things with the Power in his
madness. A man who has been gentled can still sense the True
Source, but he cannot touch it. Whatever madness has come before
gentling is arrested by the act of gentling, but not cured by it,
and if it is done soon enough death can be averted. <em>See
also</em> One Power, the; stilling.</dd>

but can see like eagles in light or dark. They have certain powers
stemming from the Dark One, including the ability to cause
paralyzing fear with a look and the ability to vanish wherever
there are shadows. One of their few known weaknesses is that they
are reluctant to cross running water. In different lands they are
known by many names, among them Halfman, the Eyeless, Shadowman,
Lurk, Fetch, and Fade.</dd>

<dt><strong>Natael, Jasin</strong> (<strong>nah-TAYL,

<dt><strong>Niall, Pedron</strong> (<strong>NEYE-awl,
PAY-drohn</strong>):</dt>

<dd>Lord Captain Commander of the Children of the Light. <em>See
also</em> Children of the Light.</dd>

<dt>&nbsp;</dt>

<dt><strong>Oaths, Three</strong>:</dt>

<dd>The oaths taken by an Accepted who is being raised to Aes
Sedai. Spoken while holding the Oath Rod, a <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>
that makes oaths binding. They are:</dd>

<dd>(1) To speak no word that is not true.</dd>

<dd>(2) To make no weapon with which one man may kill another.</dd>

<dd>(3) Never to use the One Power as a weapon except against
Shadowspawn, or in the last extreme of defense of her own life, or
that of her Warder, or another Aes Sedai.</dd>

<dd>These oaths were not always required, but various events before
and since the Breaking caused them to be necessary. The second oath
was the first adopted, in response to the War of the Power. The
first oath, while held to the letter, is often circumvented by
careful speaking. It is believed that the last two are
inviolable.</dd>


<dt><strong>Ogier</strong> (<strong>OH-gehr</strong>):</dt>

<dd>(1) A non-human race, characterized by great height (ten feet
is average for adult males), broad, almost snout-like noses, and
long, tufted ears. They live in areas called <em>stedding</em>.
Their separation from these <em>stedding</em> after the Breaking of
the World (a time called the Exile by the Ogier) resulted in what
is called the Longing; an Ogier who is too long out of the
<em>stedding</em> sickens and dies. Widely known as wondrous
stonemasons who built the great human cities after the Breaking,
they consider stonework simply something they learned during the
Exile and not as important as tending the trees of the
<em>stedding</em>, especially the towering Great Trees. Except for
stonework, they rarely leave their <em>stedding</em> and typically
have little contact with humankind. Knowledge of them among humans
is sparse, and many believe Ogier to be only legends. Although
believed to be a pacific people and extremely slow to anger, some
old stories say they fought alongisde humans in the Trolloc Wars,
and call them implacable enemies. By and large, they are extremely
fond of knowledge, and their books and stories often contain
information lost to humans. A typical Ogier life-span is at least
three to four times that of a human.</dd>

<dd>(2) Any individual of that non-human race.</dd>

<dd><em>See also</em> Breaking of the World; <em>stedding</em>;
Treesinger.</dd>


<dt><strong>Old Tongue</strong>:</dt>

<dd>The language spoken during the Age of Legends. It is generally
expected that nobles and the educated will have learned to speak
this, but most know only a few words. Translation is often
difficult, as it is a language capable of many subtly different
meanings.</dd>


<dt><strong>One Power, the</strong>:</dt>

<dd>The power drawn from the True Source. The vast majority of
people are completely unable to learn to channel the One Power. A
very small number can be taught to channel, and an even tinier
number have the ability inborn. For these few there is no need to
be taught; they will touch the True Source and channel the Power
whether they want to or not, perhaps without even realizing what
they are doing. This inborn ability usually manifests itself in
late adolescence or early adulthood. If control is not taught, or
self-learned (extremely difficult, with a success rate of only one
in four), death is certain. Since the Time of Madness, no man has
been able to channel the Power without eventually going completely,
horribly mad, and then, even if he has learned some control, dying
from a wasting sickness that causes the sufferer to rot alive, a
sickness caused, as is the madness, by the Dark One&rsquo;s taint on
<em>saidin</em>. For a woman the death that comes without control
of the Power is less horrible, but it is death just the same. Aes
Sedai search for girls with the inborn ability as much to save
their lives as to increase Aes Sedai numbers, and for men with it
in order to stop the terrible things they inevitably do with the
Power in their madness. <em>See also</em> Aes Sedai; channel; Five
Powers; Time of Madness; True Source.</dd>


<dt><strong>Ordeith</strong> (<strong>OHR-deeth</strong>):</dt>

<dd>In the Old Tongue, &ldquo;Wormwood.&rdquo; Name taken by a man who advises
the Lord Captain Commander of the Children of the Light.</dd>

<dt>&nbsp;</dt>

<dt><strong>Pattern of an Age</strong>:</dt>

<dd>The Wheel of Time weaves the threads of human lives into the
Pattern of an Age, often called simply the Pattern, which forms the
substance of reality for that Age. <em>See also</em>
<em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>.</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>


<dt><strong>Questioners, the</strong>:</dt>

<dd>An order within the Children of the Light. Their avowed
purposes are to discover the truth in disputations and to uncover
Darkfriends. In the search for truth and the Light, their normal
method of inquiry is by torture; their normal attitude that they
know the truth already and must only make their victim confess to
it. The Questioners refer to themselves as the Hand of the Light,
the Hand that digs out truth, and at times act as if they were
entirely separate from the Children and the Council of the
Anointed, which commands the Children. The head of the Questioners
is the High Inquisitor, who sits on the Council of the Anointed.
Their sign is a blood-red shepherd&rsquo;s crook</dd>


<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dt><strong>Rendra</strong> (<strong>REHN-drah</strong>):</dt>

<dd>A woman of Tarabon. Innkeeper of the Three Plums Court, in
Tarabon.</dd>


<dt><strong>Rhuarc</strong> (<strong>RHOURK</strong>):</dt>

<dd>An Aiel, clan chief of the Taardad Aiel.</dd>


<dt><strong>Rhuidean</strong> (<strong>RHUY-dee-ahn</strong>):</dt>

<dd>A place in the Aiel Waste to which must go any man wanting to
be a clan chief and any woman wanting to be a Wise One. Men may
enter only once, women twice. Only one man in three survives his
journey to Rhuidean. The survival rate for women is considerably
higher for both visits. Its location is a secret closely guarded by
the Aiel. The prescribed penalty for a non-Aiel entering the valley
of Rhuidean is death, though some who are favored (such as peddlers
or gleemen) might simply be stripped naked, given waterskins, and
allowed to attempt to walk out of the Waste.</dd>

<dt>&nbsp;</dt>

<dt><em><strong>sa&rsquo;angreal</strong></em>
(<strong>SAH-ahn-GREE-ahl</strong>):</dt>

<dd>Any one of a number of objects that allow channelling much more
of the One Power than would otherwise be possible or safe. A
<em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em> is like unto, but much more powerful than, an
<em>angreal</em>. The amount of the Power that can be wielded with
a <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em> compares to the amount of the Power that can
be handled with an <em>angreal</em> as the power wielded with the
aid of an <em>angreal</em> does to the amount of the Power that can
be handled unaided. The making of them is no longer known. As with
<em>angreal</em>, there are male and female <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>.
Only a handful remain, far fewer even than <em>angreal</em>.</dd>


<dt><strong>sa&rsquo;sara</strong> (<strong>sah-SAHR-rah</strong>):</dt>

<dd>An indecent Saldean dance, outlawed by a number of Saldean
queens, but to no avail. Saldean history records three wars, two
rebellions, and countless unions and/or feuds between noble houses,
as well as innumberable duels, sparked by women dancing the
sa&rsquo;sara. One rebellion was supposedly quelled when a defeated queen
danced it for the victorious general; he married her and restored
her throne. This tale is not found in any official history and has
been denied by every queen of Saldea.</dd>


<dt><strong><em>saidar</em></strong> (<strong>sah-ih-DAHR</strong>):
<strong><em>saidin</em></strong> (<strong>sah-ih-DEEN</strong>):</dt>

<dd><em>See</em> True Source.</dd>


<dt><strong>Sandar, Juilin</strong> (<strong>sahn-DAHR,
JUY-lihn</strong>):</dt>

<dd>A thief-catcher from Tear.</dd>


<dt><strong>Sea Folk</strong>:</dt>

<dd>More properly, the Atha&rsquo;an Miere (a-tha-AHN mee-AIR), the
People of the Sea. Inhabitants of islands in the Aryth (AH-rihth)
Ocean and the Sea of Storms, they spend little time on those
islands, living most of their lives on their ships. Most seaborne
trade is carried by the Sea Folk&rsquo;s ships.</dd>


<dt><strong>Seana</strong> (<strong>see-AHN-ah</strong>):</dt>

<dd>A Wise One of the Black Cliffs sept of the Nakai Aiel. A
dreamwalker.</dd>


<dt><strong>Seanchan</strong> (<strong>SHAWN-CHAN</strong>):</dt>

<dd>(1) Descendants of the armies Artur Hawkwing sent across the
Aryth Ocean, who conquered the lands there. They believe that any
woman who can channel must be controlled for the safety of everyone
else, and any man who can channel must be killed for the same
reason.</dd>

<dd>(2) The land from which the Seanchan come.</dd>


<dt><strong>Seekers for Truth</strong>:</dt>

<dd>A police/spy organization of the Seanchan Imperial Throne.
Although most are property of the Imperial family, they have wide
powers. Even one of the Blood (a Seanchan noble) can be arrested
for failure to answer any question put by a Seeker, or for failure
to cooperate fully with a Seeker, this last defined by the Seekers
themselves, subject only to review by the Empress.</dd>


<dt><strong>Servants, Hall of the</strong>:</dt>

<dd>In the Age of Legends, the great meeting hall of the Aes
Sedai.</dd>


<dt><strong>Sevanna</strong> (<strong>seh-VAHN-nah</strong>):</dt>

<dd>A woman of the Domai sept of the Shaido Aiel. Widow of Suladric
(soo-LAH-dric), who was clan chief of the Shaido, and thus
roofmistress of Comarda Hold until a new clan chief is chosen.</dd>


<dt><strong>Shaogi, Keille</strong> (<strong>shah-OH-ghe,
KEYEL-lee</strong>):</dt>

<dd>A peddler traveling in the Aiel Waste. A woman with plans even
larger than she is.</dd>


<dt><strong>Shayol Ghul</strong> (<strong>SHAY-of
GHOOL</strong>):</dt>

<dd>A mountain in the Blasted Lands, the site of the Dark One&rsquo;s
prison.</dd>


<dt><strong>Siuan Sanche</strong> (<strong>SWAHN
SAHN-chay</strong>):</dt>

<dd>The daughter of a Tairen fisherman, she was, according to
Tairen law, put on a ship to Tar Valon before the second sunset
after it was discovered that she had the potential to channel.
Formerly of the Blue Ajah. Raised to the Amyrlin Seat in 988
NE.</dd>

<dd><em>See</em> Length, units of.</dd>


<dt><strong>Spine of the World, the</strong>:</dt>

<dd>A towering mountain range, with only a few passes, which
separates the Aiel Waste from the lands to the west.</dd>


<dt><strong><em>stedding</em></strong> (<strong>STEHD-ding</strong>):</dt>

<dd>An Ogier (OH-geer) homeland. Many <em>stedding</em> have been
abandoned since the Breaking of the World. They are shielded in
some way, no longer understood, so that within them no Aes Sedai
can channel the One Power, nor even sense that the True Source
exists. Attempts to wield the One Power from outside a
<em>stedding</em> have no effect inside a <em>stedding</em>
boundary. No Trolloc will enter a <em>stedding</em> unless driven,
and even a Myrddraal will do so only at the greatest need and then
with the greatest reluctance and distaste. Even Darkfriends, if
truly dedicated, feel uncomfortable within a
<em>stedding</em>.</dd>


<dt><strong>stilling</strong>:</dt>

<dd>The act, performed by Aes Sedai, of shutting off a woman who
can channel from the One Power. A woman who has been stilled can
sense the True Source, but she cannot touch it. So seldom has it
been done that novices are required to learn the names and crimes
of all women who have suffered it. Officially, stilling is the
result of trial and sentence for a crime. When it happens
accidentally, it is called being burned out. In practice, the term
stilling is often used for both.</dd>


<dt><strong>Stone of Tear</strong>:</dt>

<dd>A great fortress in the city of Tear, said to have been made by
use of the One Power soon after the Breaking of the World. Attacked
and besieged countless times, it fell in a single night to the
Dragon Reborn and a few hundred Aiel, thus fulfilling two parts of
the Prophecies of the Dragon. The Stone contains a collection of
<em>an&rsquo;greal</em> and <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> rivaling that of the
White Tower, a collection which was gathered, some say, in an
attempt to diminish the glare of possessing
<em>Callandor</em>.</dd>


<dt><strong><em>sul&rsquo;dam</em></strong> (<em>SOOL-dam</em>):</dt>

<dd>Literally, &ldquo;leash holder.&rdquo; Seanchan term for a woman with the
ability to control, by means of an <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>, a woman who can
channel. Young women in Seanchan are tested for this ability at the
same time as the testing for <em>damane</em> and to the same age. A
fairly honored position among the Seanchan. Many more
<em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> are found than <em>damane</em>. <em>See also
a&rsquo;dam</em>; <em>damane</em>; Seanchan.</dd>

<dt><strong>Sursa</strong> (<strong>SUHR-sa</strong>):</dt>

<dd>Thin, paired sticks used as eating implements in Arad Doman in
place of forks. Some say the difficulty of eating with
sursa is the source of Domani merchants&rsquo; fabled
perseverance; others claim it is the source of the equally fabled
Domani temper.</dd>

<dt>&nbsp;</dt>

<dt><strong>Talents</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Abilities in the use of the One Power in specific areas. The
best known of these, of course, is Healing. Some, such as
Traveling, the ability to shift oneself from one place to another
without crossing the intervening space, have been lost. Others such
as Foretelling (the ability to foretell future events, but in a
general way) are now found only rarely if at all. Another Talent
long thought lost is Dreaming, which involves, among other things,
interpreting the Dreamer&rsquo;s dreams to foretell future events in more
specific fashion than Foretelling does. Some Dreamers had the
ability to enter <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, the World of Dreams, and
(it is said) even other people&rsquo;s dreams. The last known Dreamer was
Corianin Nedeal (coh-ree-AHN-ihn neh-dee-AHL), who died in 526 NE,
but there is now another, known to but a few.</dd>


<dt><strong><em>ta&rsquo;maral&rsquo;ailen</em></strong>

<dt><strong><em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em></strong>
(<strong>tel-AYE-rahn-rhee-ODD</strong>):</dt>

<dd>In the Old Tongue, &ldquo;the Unseen World&rdquo;, or &ldquo;the World of
Dreams.&rdquo; A world glimpsed in dreams which was believed by the
ancients to permeate and surround all other possible worlds. Unlike
other dreams, what happens to living things in the World of Dreams
is real; a wound taken there will still be there on awakening, and
one who dies there does not wake at all.</dd>


<dt><strong><em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em></strong>
(<strong>TEER-ahn-GREE-ahl</strong>):</dt>

<dd>Any one of a number of remnants of the Age of Legends that use
the One Power. Unlike <em>angreal</em> and <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>,
each <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> was made to do a particular thing. For
example, one makes oaths taken within it binding. Some are used by
Aes Sedai, but their original purposes are largely unknown. Some
will kill or destroy the ability to channel of any woman who uses
them. <em>See also</em> <em>angreal</em>; <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>.</dd>


<dt><strong>Time of Madness</strong>:</dt>

<dd>The years after the Dark One&rsquo;s counterstroke tainted the male
half of the True Source, when male Aes Sedai went mad and Broke the
World. The exact duration of this period is unknown, but it is
believed to have lasted nearly one hundred years. It ended
completely only with the death of the last male Aes Sedai. <em>See
also</em> Hundred Companions; True Source; One Power; Breaking of
the World.</dd>


<dt><strong>Torean</strong> (<strong>toh-ree-AHN</strong>):</dt>

fortune nor his face will gain him.</dd>

<dt><strong>Trollocs</strong> (<strong>TRAHL-lohks</strong>):</dt>

<dd>Creatures of the Dark One, created during the War of the
Shadow. Huge in stature, they are a twisted blend of animal and
human stock. Vicious by nature, they kill for the pure pleasure of
killing. Deceitful in the extreme, they cannot be trusted unless
coerced by fear. They are divided into tribe-like bands, among them
the Dha&rsquo;vol, the Ko&rsquo;bal, and the Dhai&rsquo;mon.</dd>


<dt><strong>Trolloc Wars</strong>:</dt>

<dd>A series of wars, beginning about 1000 AB and lasting more than
three hundred years, during which Trolloc armies ravaged the world.
Eventually the Trollocs were slain or driven back into the Great
Blight, but some nations ceased to exist, while others were almost
depopulated. All records of the time are fragmentary.</dd>


<dt><strong>True Source</strong>:</dt>

<dd>The driving force of the universe, which turns the Wheel of
Time. It is divided into a male half (<em>saidin</em>) and a female half
(<em>saidar</em>), which work at the same time with and against each other.
Only a man can draw on <em>saidin</em>, only a woman on
<em>saidar</em>. Since the beginning of the Time of Madness,
<em>saidin</em> has been tainted by the Dark One&rsquo;s touch. <em>See
also</em> One Power.</dd>


<dt><strong>Tuatha&rsquo;an</strong>
(<strong>too-AH-thah-AHN</strong>):</dt>

<dd>A wandering folk, also known as the Tinkers and as the
Traveling People, who live in brightly painted wagons and follow a
totally pacifist philosophy called the Way of the Leaf. Things
mended by Tinkers are often better than new. They are among the few
who can cross the Aiel Waste unmolested, for the Aiel strictly
avoid all contact with them.</dd>


<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dt><strong>Verin Mathwin</strong> (<strong>VEHR-ihn
MAH-thwin</strong>):</dt>

<dd>An Aes Sedai of the Brown Ajah.</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>

<dt><strong>Warder</strong>:</dt>

<dd>A warrior bonded to an Aes Sedai. The bonding is a thing of the
One Power, and by it he gains such gifts as quick healing, the
ability to go long periods without food, water, or rest, and the
ability to sense the taint of the Dark One at a distance. So long
as a Warder lives, the Aes Sedai to whom he is bonded knows he is
alive however far away he is, and when he dies she will know the
moment and manner of his death. The bonding does not tell her how
far he is, though, nor in what direction. While most Ajahs believe
an Aes Sedai may have one Warder bonded to her at a time, the Red
Ajah refuses to bond any Warders at all, while the Green Ajah
believe an Aes Sedai may bond as many Warders as she wishes.
Ethically the Warder must accede to the bonding, but it has been
known to be done involuntarily. What the Aes Sedai gain from the
bonding is a closely held secret. <em>See
also</em> Aes Sedai.</dd>


<dt><strong>War of Power</strong>:</dt>

<dt><strong>War of the Hundred Years</strong>:</dt>

<dd>A series of overlapping wars among constantly shifting
alliances, precipitated by the death of Artur Hawkwing and the
resulting struggle for his empire. It lasted from FY 994 to FY
1117. The war depopulated large parts of the lands between the
Aryth Ocean and the Aiel Waste, from the Sea of Storms to the Great
Blight. So great was the destruction that only fragmentary records
of the time remain. The empire of Artur Hawkwing was pulled apart
in the wars, and the nations of the present day were formed.

<dt><strong>War of the Second Dragon</strong>:</dt>

<dd>The war fought (FY 939-43) against the false Dragon Guaire
Amalasan. During this war a young king named Artur Tanreall
Paendrag, later known as Artur Hawkwing, rose to overwhelming
prominence.</dd>


<dt><strong>War of the Shadow</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Also known as the War of Power, it ended the Age of Legends. It
began shortly after the attempt to free the Dark One, and soon
involved the whole world. In a world where even the memory of war
had been forgotten, every facet of war was rediscovered, often
twisted by the Dark One&rsquo;s touch on the world, and the One Power was
used as a weapon. The war was ended by the resealing of the Dark
One into his prison. <em>See also</em> Hundred Companions, the;

<dt><strong>Wheel of Time, the</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Time is a wheel with seven spokes, each spoke an Age. As the
Wheel turns, the Ages come and go, each leaving memories that fade
to legend, then to myth, and are forgotten by the time that Age
comes again. The Pattern of an Age is slightly different each time
an Age comes, and each time it is subject to greater change, but
each time it is the same Age.</dd>

<dt><strong>wilder</strong>:</dt>

<dd>A woman who has learned to channel the One Power on her own,
surviving the crisis as only one in four does. Such women usually
build barriers against knowing what it is they are doing, but if
these can be broken down, wilders are among the most powerful of
channelers. The term is often used in derogatory fashion.</dd>


<dt><strong>Wisdom</strong>:</dt>

<dd>In villages, a woman chosen by the Women&rsquo;s Circle for her
knowledge of such things as healing, and foretelling the weather,
as well as for common good sense. A position of great
responsibility and authority, both actual and implied. She is
generally considered the equal of the mayor, just as the Women&rsquo;s
Circle is the equal of the Village Council. Unlike the mayor, the
Wisdom is chosen for life, and it is very rare for a Wisdom to be
removed from office before her death. Depending on the land, she
may instead have another title, such as Guide, Healer, Wise Woman,
or Seeker.</dd>


<dt><strong>Wise One</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Among the Aiel, Wise Ones are women chosen by other Wise Ones
and trained in healing, herbs and other things, much like Wisdoms.
Usually there is a single Wise One to each clan or sept hold. Some
Wise Ones are said to have wondrous healing abilities, and to do
things that seem miraculous. They have great authority and
responsibility, as well as great influence with sept and clan
chiefs, though these men often accuse them of meddling.</dd>
