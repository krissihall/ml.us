<h4><em>Veils</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
crowds were thick in the confined winding streets
of the Calpene near the Great Circle; the smoke of countless cook
fires rising above the high white walls gave the reason. Sour
smells of smoke and cooking and long unwashed sweat hung heavy in
the humid morning air with the crying of children and the vague
murmurs that always clung to large masses of people, together
enough to muffle the shrill caws of the gulls sailing overhead. The
shops in this area had long since locked the iron grilles over
their doors for good.</p>

<p>Disgusted, Egeanin threaded her way through the
throng afoot. It was dreadful that order had broken down enough for
penniless refugees to take over the circles, sleeping among the
stone benches. It was as bad as their rulers letting them starve.
Her heart should have been gladdened&mdash;this dispirited rabble
could never resist the <em>Corenne</em>, and then proper order
would be restored&mdash;but she hated looking at it.</p>

<p>Most of the ragged people around her seemed too
apathetic to wonder at a woman in their midst in a clean,
well-tended blue riding dress, silk if plainly cut. Men and women
in once fine garb, soiled and wrinkled now, speckled the crowd, so
perhaps she did not stand out enough for contrast. The few who
seemed to wonder whether her clothes meant coins in her purse were
dissuaded by the competent way she carried her stout staff, as tall
as she was. Guards and chair and bearers had had to be left behind
today. Floran Gelb would surely have realized he was being followed
by that array. At least this dress with its divided skirts gave her
a little freedom of movement.</p>

<p>Keeping the weasely little man in sight was easy even
in this mass of people, despite having to dodge oxcarts or the
occasional wagon, hauled by sweating bare-chested men more often
than animals. Gelb and seven or eight companions, burly rough-faced
men all, shoved through in a knot, an eddy of curses following
them. Those fellows angered her. Gelb meant to try kidnapping
again. He had found three women since she sent him the gold he had
asked for, none more than casually resembling any on her list, and
had whined over every one she rejected. She should never have paid
him for that first woman he snatched off the street. Greed and the
memory of gold had apparently washed out the hide-flaying
tongue-lashing she had given him along with the purse.</p>

<p>Shouts from behind pulled her head around and
tightened her hands on the staff. A small space had opened up, as
it always did around trouble. A bellowing man in a torn, once-fine
yellow coat was on his knees in the street, clutching his right arm
where it bent the wrong way. Huddling over him protectively, a
weeping woman in a tattered green gown was crying at a veiled
fellow already melting into the crowd. &ldquo;He only asked for a coin!
He only asked!&rdquo; The crowd swirled in around them again.</p>

<p>Grimacing, Egeanin turned back. And stopped with an
oath that drew a few startled glances. Gelb and his fellows had
vanished. Pushing her way to a small stone fountain where water
gushed from the mouth of a bronze fish on the side of a flat-roofed
wineshop, she roughly displaced two of the women filling pots and
leaped up onto the coping, ignoring their indignant curses. From
there she could see over the heads of the crowd, Cramped streets
ran off in every direction, twisting around the hills. Bends and
white-plastered buildings cut her view to less than a hundred paces
at best, but Gelb could not have gone farther than that in those
few moments.</p>

<p>Abruptly she found him, hiding in a deep doorway
thirty paces on, but up on his toes to peer down the street. The
others were easy enough to locate then, leaning against buildings
to either side of the street, trying not to be noticed. They were
not the only ones lining the walls, but where the rest huddled
dispiritedly, their scared, broken-nosed faces held
expectation.</p>

<p>So it was to be here, their abduction. Certainly no
one would interfere, any more than people had when that fellow&rsquo;s
arm was broken. But who? If Gelb had finally found someone on the
list, she could go away and wait for him to sell her the woman,
wait her chance to see if an <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> truly could hold other
<em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> besides Bethamin. However, she did not mean to
face again the choice between slitting some unfortunate woman&rsquo;s
throat and sending her off to be sold.</p>

<p>There were plenty of women climbing up the street
toward Gelb, most in those transparent veils, their hair braided.
Without a second glance Egeanin ruled out two in sedan chairs, with
bodyguards marching alongside; Gelb&rsquo;s street toughs would not
tangle with near their own number, nor face swords with their
fists. Whoever they were after would have no more than two or three
men for company if that, and none armed. That seemed to include all
the other women in her view, whether in rags of drab country
dresses or the more clinging styles Taraboner women favored.</p>

<p>Suddenly two of those women, talking together as they
rounded a far bend, seized Egeanin&rsquo;s eye. With their hair in
slender braids and transparent veils across their faces, they
appeared to be Taraboners, but they were out of place here. Those
thin, scandalously draped dresses, one green, the other blue, were
silk, not linen or finespun wool. Women clothed like that rode in
sedan chairs; they did not walk, especially not here. And they did
not carry barrel staves on their shoulders like clubs.</p>

<p>Dismissing the one with red-gold hair, she studied
the other. Her dark braids were unusually long, nearly to her
waist. At this distance, the woman looked very much like a <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em> named Surine. Not Surine, though. This woman would
have come no higher than Surine&rsquo;s chin.</p>

<p>Muttering under her breath, Egeanin jumped down and
began pushing through the jostling mass between her and Gelb. With
luck she could reach him in time to call him off. The fool. The
greedy, weasel-brained fool!</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">&ldquo;We should have hired chairs, Nynaeve,&rdquo; Elayne said
again, wondering for the hundredth time how Taraboner women talked
without catching the veils in their mouths. Spitting it out, she
added, &ldquo;We are going to have to use these things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A weedy-faced fellow stopped drifting toward them
through the crowd when Nynaeve hefted her barrel stave
threateningly. &ldquo;That is what they are for.&rdquo; Her glare might have
encouraged the man&rsquo;s loss of interest. She fumbled at the dark
braids hanging over her shoulders and made a disgusted sound;
Elayne did not know when she would become used to not having that
one thick braid to tug. &ldquo;And feet are for walking. How could we
look or ask questions being carried around like pigs to sale? I
would feel a complete fool in one of those idiot chairs. In any
case, I&rsquo;d rather trust to my own wits than men I do not know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne was sure Bayle Domon could have provided
trustworthy men. The Sea Folk certainly would have; she wished <em>
Wavedancer</em> had not sailed, but the Sailmistress and her sister
had been eager to spread word of the Coramoor to Dantora and
Cantorin. Twenty bodyguards would have suited her very well.</p>

<p>She sensed as much as felt something brushing the
purse at her belt; clutching at the purse with one hand, she spun
around, raising her own stave. The throng flowing by spread a
little around her, people barely glancing her way as they elbowed
one another, but there was no sign of the would-be cutpurse. At
least she could still feel the coins inside: She had taken to
wearing her Great Serpent ring and the twisted stone <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em> on a cord around her neck in imitation of Nynaeve
after the first time she had nearly lost a purse. In their five
days in Tanchico she <em>had</em> lost three. Twenty guards would
be just about right. And a carriage. With curtains at the
windows.</p>

<p>Resuming the slow climb up the street beside Nynaeve,
she said, &ldquo;Then we should not be wearing these dresses. I can
remember a time when you stuffed me into a farmgirl&rsquo;s dress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They make a good disguise,&rdquo; Nynaeve replied curtly.
&ldquo;We blend in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne gave a small sniff. As if plainer dresses
would not have blended even better. Nynaeve would not admit she had
come to enjoy wearing silks and pretty dresses. Elayne simply
wished she had not taken it so far. True, everyone took them for
Taraboners&mdash;until they spoke, at least&mdash;but even with a
lace-trimmed neck right up under her chin, this close-draped green
silk at least <em>felt</em> more revealing than anything she had
ever worn before. Certainly anything she had ever worn in public.
Nynaeve, on the other hand, strode along the cramped street as if
no one was looking at them at all. Well, maybe no one was&mdash;not because of how their dresses fit, anyway&mdash;but it surely
seemed they were.</p>

<p>Their shifts would have been almost as decent. Cheeks
heating, she tried to stop thinking of how the silk molded itself
to her. <em>Stop that! It is perfectly decent. It is!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t this Amys tell you anything that might help
us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you what she said.&rdquo; Elayne sighed. Nynaeve
had kept her up until the small hours talking about the Aiel Wise
One who had been with Egwene in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> last night,
and then started in again before they sat down to breakfast.
Egwene, with her hair in two braids for some reason and shooting
sullen frowns at the Wise One, had said almost nothing beyond that
Rand was well and Aviendha was looking after him. White-haired Amys
had done all the talking, a stern lecture on the dangers of the
World of Dreams that had nearly made Elayne feel as if she were ten
again, and Lini, her old nurse, had caught her sneaking out of bed
to steal candies, followed by cautions about concentration and
controlling what she thought if she must enter <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. How could you control what you thought? &ldquo;I
truly did think Perrin was with Rand and Mat.&rdquo; That had been the
biggest surprise, after Amys&rsquo;s appearance. Egwene apparently had
thought he was with Nynaeve and her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He and that girl have probably gone somewhere he can
be a blacksmith in peace,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, but Elayne shook her
head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think so.&rdquo; She had strong suspicions about
Faile, and if they were even half right, Faile would not settle for
being a blacksmith&rsquo;s wife. She spat out the veil once more. Idiotic
thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, wherever he is,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, fumbling with
her braids again, &ldquo;I hope he is safe and well, but he is not here,
and he cannot help us. Did you even <em>ask</em> Amys if she knew
any way to use <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> to&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A bulky, balding man in a worn brown coat shoved
through the crowd and tried to throw thick arms around her. She
whipped the barrel stave from her shoulder and gave him a crack
across his broad face that sent him staggering back, clutching a
nose that had surely been broken for at least the second time.</p>

<p>Elayne was still gathering breath for a startled
scream when a second man, just as big and with a thick mustache,
pushed her aside to reach for Nynaeve. She forgot about being
afraid. Her jaw tightened furiously, and just as his hands touched
the other woman, she brought her own stave down on top of his head
with every bit of strength she could muster. The fellow&rsquo;s legs
folded, and he toppled on his face in a most satisfactory
fashion.</p>

<p>The crowd scattered back, no one wanting to be caught
up in someone else&rsquo;s trouble. Certainly no one offered to help. And
they needed it, Elayne realized. The man Nynaeve had hit was still
on his feet, mouth twisted in a snarl, licking away the blood that
ran down from his nose, flexing thick hands as if he wanted to
squeeze a throat. Worse, he was not alone. Seven more men were
fanning out with him to cut off any escape, all but one as large as
he, with scarred faces and hands that looked as if they had been
hammered on stone for years. A scrawny, narrow-cheeked fellow,
grinning like a nervous fox, kept panting, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let her get away.
She&rsquo;s gold, I tell you. Gold!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They knew who she was. This was no try for a purse;
they meant to dispose of Nynaeve and abduct the Daughter-Heir of
Andor. She felt Nynaeve embracing <em>saidar</em>&mdash;if this
had not made her angry enough to channel, nothing ever would&mdash;and opened herself to the True Source as well. The One Power rushed
into her, a sweet flood filling her from toes to hair. A few woven
flows of Air from either of them could deal with these
ruffians.</p>

<p>But she did not channel, and neither did Nynaeve.
Together they could drub these fellows as their mothers should
have. Yet they did not dare, unless there was no other choice.</p>

<p>If one of the Black Ajah was close enough to see,
they had already betrayed themselves with the glow of <em>
saidar</em>. Channeling enough for those few flows of Air could
betray them to a Black sister on another street a hundred paces or
more away, depending on her strength and sensitivity. That was most
of what they themselves had been doing the last five days, walking
through the city trying to sense a woman channeling, hoping the
feeling would draw them to Liandrin and the others.</p>

<p>The crowd itself had to be considered, too. A few
people still went by to either side, brushing tight against the
walls. The rest milled about, beginning to find other ways to go.
Only a handful acknowledged the two women in danger with as much as
shamefully averted eyes. But if they saw big men flung about by
nothing visible&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?</p>

<p>Aes Sedai and the One Power itself were not in
particularly good odor in Tanchico at the moment, not with old
rumors from Falme still floating about and newer tales claiming
that the White Tower supported the Dragonsworn in the countryside.
Those people might run if they saw the Power wielded. Or they might
turn into a mob. Even if she and Nynaeve managed to avoid being
torn limb from limb where they stood&mdash;which she was not
certain they could&mdash;there was no way to cover it up after.
The Black Ajah would hear of Aes Sedai in Tanchico before the sun
set.</p>

<p>Setting herself back-to-back with Nynaeve, Elayne
gripped her stave tightly. She felt like laughing hysterically. If
Nynaeve even mentioned going out alone again&mdash;<em>
walking</em>&mdash;she would see who liked having her head dunked
in a bucket of water. At least none of these louts looked eager to
be the first to have his head cracked like the fellow lying still
on the paving stones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; the narrow-faced man urged, waving his hands
forward. &ldquo;Go on! It&rsquo;s only two women!&rdquo; He made no move to rush in
himself, though. &ldquo;Go on, I say. We just need the one. She&rsquo;s gold, I
tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a loud <em>thunk</em>, and one of
the ruffians staggered to his knees, clutching groggily at a split
scalp, and a dark-haired, stern-faced woman in a blue riding dress
flung herself past him, twisted sharply to backhand another fellow
in the mouth with her fist, knocked his legs out from under him
with a staff, then kicked him in the head as he fell.</p>

<p>That there was help at all was startling, much less
the source, but Elayne was of no mind to pick and choose. Nynaeve
left her back with a wordless roar, and she dashed out shouting,
&ldquo;Forward the White Lion!&rdquo; to belabor the nearest lout as hard and
fast as she could. Flinging his arms up to defend himself, he
looked shocked out of his wits. &ldquo;Forward the White Lion!&rdquo; she
shouted again, the battle cry of Andor, and he turned tail and
ran.</p>

<p>Laughing in spite of herself, she whirled about
seeking another to drub. Only two had not yet fled or fallen. That
first broken-nosed fellow turned to run, and Nynaeve gave him a
final full-armed thwack across the backside. The stern-faced woman
somehow tangled the other&rsquo;s arm and shoulder with her staff,
pulling him close and up on his toes at the same time; he would
have overtopped her by a head flat-footed and he weighed twice what
she did, but she coolly slammed the heel of her free hand up into
his chin three times in rapid succession. His eyes rolled up in his
head, but as he sagged, Elayne saw the narrow-faced man picking
himself up off the street; his nose dripped blood and his eyes
looked half-glazed, yet he pulled a knife from his belt and lunged
at the woman&rsquo;s back.</p>

<p>Without thinking, Elayne channeled. A fist of Air
hurled the man and his knife into a backflip. The stern-faced woman
spun, but he was already scrambling away on all fours until he
could get his feet under him and burrow into the crowd farther up
the street. People had stopped to watch the odd battle, though none
had raised a hand to help except the dark-haired woman. She herself
was staring from Elayne to Nynaeve uncertainly. Elayne wondered
whether she had noticed the scrawny fellow being knocked down
apparently by nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I give you my thanks,&rdquo; Nynaeve said a touch
breathlessly as she approached the woman, straightening her veil.
&ldquo;I think we should leave here. I know the Civil Watch doesn&rsquo;t come
out in the streets much, but I&rsquo;d not like to explain this if they
do happen by. Our inn is not far. Will you join us? A cup of tea is
the least we can offer someone who actually lifts a hand to help
someone in this Light-forsaken city. My name is Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara
and this is Elayne Trakand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman hesitated visibly. She <em>had</em>
noticed. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I would&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;like that. Yes. I would.&rdquo; She had a
slurred way of speaking, difficult to understand, but somehow
vaguely familiar. She was quite a lovely woman, really, seeming
even fairer than she was because of her dark hair, worn almost to
the shoulder. A bit too hard to be called a beauty. Her blue eyes
had a strong look, as if she were used to giving orders. A
merchant, perhaps, in that dress. &ldquo;I am called Egeanin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egeanin showed no hesitation in leaving with them
down the nearest side street. The crowds were already gathering
around the fallen men. Elayne expected those fellows would wake to
find themselves stripped of anything of value, even clothes and
boots. She wished she knew how they had discovered her identity,
but there was no way to bring one along to find out. They were <em>
definitely</em> going to have bodyguards from now on, no matter
what Nynaeve said.</p>

<p>Egeanin might not have been hesitant, but she was
uneasy. Elayne could see it in her eyes as they wove through the
crowd. &ldquo;You saw, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she asked. The woman missed a step,
all the confirmation Elayne needed, and she added hurriedly, &ldquo;We
won&rsquo;t harm you. Certainly not after you came to our rescue.&rdquo; Again
she had to spit out her veil. Nynaeve did not seem to have that
problem. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t frown at me, Nynaeve. She saw what I
did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; Nynaeve said dryly. &ldquo;And it was the
right thing to do. But we are not snug in your mother&rsquo;s palace
tucked away from prying ears.&rdquo; Her gesture took in the people
around them. Between Egeanin&rsquo;s staff and their staves, most were
giving them a wide berth. To Egeanin she said, &ldquo;The larger part of
any rumors you may have heard are not true. Few of them are. You
need not be afraid of us, but you can understand there are matters
we do not care to speak of here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Afraid of you?&rdquo; Egeanin looked startled. &ldquo;I had not
thought I should be. I will keep silent until you wish to speak.&rdquo;
She was as good as her word; they walked on in silence through the
murmurs of the crowd all the way back down the peninsula to the
Three Plum Court. All this walking was making Elayne&rsquo;s feet
ache.</p>

<p>A handful of men and women sat in the common room
despite the early hour, nursing their wine or ale. The woman with
her hammered dulcimer was being accompanied by a thin man playing a
flute that sounded as reedy as he was. Juilin sat at a table near
the door, smoking a short-stemmed pipe. He had not returned from
his nightly foray when they left. Elayne was glad to see that for
once he did not have a new bruise or cut; what he called the
underside of Tanchico seemed even rougher than the face the city
presented to the world. His one concession to Tanchican dress had
been to replace his flat straw hat with one of those dark conical
felt caps, which he wore perched on the back of his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have found them,&rdquo; he said, popping up from his
bench and snatching off his cap, before he saw they were not alone.
He gave Egeanin a hooded look and a small bow; she returned it with
an inclination of her head and a look just as guarded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve found them?&rdquo; Nynaeve exclaimed. &ldquo;Are you
sure? Speak, man. Have you swallowed your tongue?&rdquo; And her with her
warnings about talking in front of other people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have said I found where they were.&rdquo; He did
not look at Egeanin again, but he chose his words carefully. &ldquo;The
woman with the white stripe in her hair led me to a house where she
was staying with a number of other women, though few were ever seen
outside. The locals thought they were rich escapees from the
countryside. Little remains now save a few scraps of food in the
pantry&mdash;even the servants are gone&mdash;but from one thing
and another I would say they left late yesterday or early last
night. I doubt they have any fear of the night in Tanchico.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve had a fistful of her narrow braids in a
white-knuckled grip. &ldquo;You went inside?&rdquo; she said in a very level
voice. Elayne thought she was an inch from raising the stave
dangling at her side.</p>

<p>Juilin seemed to think so, too. Eyeing the stave, he
said, &ldquo;You know very well I take no risks with them. An empty house
has a look about it, a feel, no matter how big. You cannot chase
thieves as long as I have without learning to see as they do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if you had triggered a trap?&rdquo; Nynaeve almost
hissed the words. &ldquo;Does your grand talent for <em>feeling</em>
things extend to traps?&rdquo; Juilin&rsquo;s dark face went a little gray; he
wet his lips as if to explain or defend himself, but she cut him
off. &ldquo;We will talk of this later, <em>Master</em> Sandar.&rdquo; Her eyes
shifted slightly toward Egeanin; finally she had remembered there
were other ears there to hear. &ldquo;Tell Rendra we will take tea in the
Falling Blossoms Room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chamber of Falling Blossoms,&rdquo; Elayne corrected
softly, and Nynaeve shot her a look. Juilin&rsquo;s news had left the
older woman in a bad humor.</p>

<p>He bowed deeply with his hands spread. &ldquo;As you
command, Mistress al&rsquo;Meara, so I obey from the heart,&rdquo; he said
wryly, then stuck his dark cap back on top of his head and stalked
off, his back eloquently indignant. It must be uncomfortable to
find yourself taking orders from someone with whom you had once
tried to flirt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fool man!&rdquo; Nynaeve growled. &ldquo;We should have left
both of them on the dock in Tear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is your servant?&rdquo; Egeanin said slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Nynaeve snapped, just as Elayne said,
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They looked at each other, Nynaeve still
frowning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he is, in a way,&rdquo; Elayne sighed, right on
top of Nynaeve&rsquo;s muttered, &ldquo;I suppose he is not, at that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;see,&rdquo; Egeanin said.</p>

<p>Rendra came bustling between the tables with a smile
on her rosebud lips behind her veil. Elayne wished she did not look
so much like Liandrin. &ldquo;Ah. You are so pretty this morning. Your
dresses, they are magnificent. Beautiful.&rdquo; As if the honey-haired
woman had not had as much to do with choosing the fabric and cut as
they. Her own was red enough for a Tinker and definitely not
suitable for public. &ldquo;But you have been foolish again, yes? That is
why the fine Juilin, he wears the large scowl. You should not worry
him so.&rdquo; A twinkle in her big brown eyes said Juilin had found
someone for his flirting. &ldquo;Come. You will take your tea in the cool
and the privacy, and if you must go out again, you will allow me to
provide the bearers and the guards, yes? The pretty Elayne would
not have lost so many purses if you were properly guarded. But we
will not talk of such things now. Your tea, it is nearly prepared.
Come.&rdquo; It had to be a learned skill, that was how Elayne saw it;
you must have to learn how to talk without eating your veil.</p>

<p>The Chamber of Falling Blossoms, located down a short
corridor off the common room, was a small, windowless room with a
low table and carved chairs with red seat cushions. Nynaeve and
Elayne took their meals there with Thom or Juilin or both, when
Nynaeve was not in a taking at them. The plastered brick walls,
painted with a veritable grove of plum trees and a namesake shower
of flowers were thick enough to preclude any eavesdropping. Elayne
practically tore her veil off and tossed the filmy scrap on the
table before sitting; even Taraboner women did not try to eat or
drink wearing the things. Nynaeve merely unfastened hers from her
hair on one side.</p>

<p>Rendra kept up her chatter while they were being
served, her topics bouncing from a new seamstress who could sew
them dresses in the newest style from the thinnest imaginable silk&mdash;she suggested Egeanin try the woman, getting a level look
for reply; it did not faze her even a trifle&mdash;to why they
should listen to Juilin since the city was just too dangerous for a
woman to go out alone now even in daylight, to a scented soap that
would put the finest sheen on their hair. Elayne sometimes wondered
how the woman ran such a successful inn when she seemed to think of
nothing but her hair and her clothes. That she did was obvious; it
was the how that puzzled Elayne. Of course, she did wear pretty
clothes; just not entirely <em>suitable</em>. The servant who
brought the tea and blue porcelain cups and tiny cakes on a tray
was the slender, dark-eyed young man who had kept filling Elayne&rsquo;s
winecup on that very embarrassing night. And had tried again more
than once, though she had privately vowed never again to drink more
than a single cup. A handsome man, but she gave him her coolest
stare, so that he hurried from the room gladly.</p>

<p>Egeanin watched quietly until Rendra left, too. &ldquo;You
are not what I expected,&rdquo; she said then, balancing her cup on her
fingertips in an odd way. &ldquo;The innkeeper babbles of frivolities as
if you were her sisters and as foolish as she, and you allow it.
The dark man&mdash;he is a servant of sorts, I think&mdash;mocks
you. That serving boy stares with open hunger in his eyes, and you
allow it. You are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Aes Sedai, are you not?&rdquo; Without waiting
for an answer, she shifted her sharp blue eyes to Elayne. &ldquo;And you
are of the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;You are nobly born. Nynaeve spoke of your mother&rsquo;s
palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such things do not count for very much in the White
Tower,&rdquo; Elayne told her ruefully, hastily brushing cake crumbs from
her chin. It was very spicy cake; almost sharp. &ldquo;If a queen went
there to learn, she would have to scrub floors like any other
novice and jump when she was told.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egeanin nodded slowly. &ldquo;So that is how you rule. By
ruling the rulers. Do&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;many&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;queens go to be trained
so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None that I know of.&rdquo; Elayne laughed. &ldquo;Though it is
our tradition in Andor for the Daughter-Heir to go. A good many
noblewomen go, really, though they usually do not want it known and
most leave having failed to even sense the True Source. It was only
an example.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are also of the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a noble?&rdquo; Egeanin asked,
and Nynaeve snorted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mother was a farmwife, and my father herded sheep
and farmed tabac. Few where I come from can make do without wool
and tabac both to sell. What of your parents, Egeanin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father was a soldier, my mother the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;an
officer on a ship.&rdquo; For a moment she sipped her unsweetened tea,
studying them. &ldquo;You are searching for someone,&rdquo; she said at last.
&ldquo;For these women the dark man spoke of. I do some small trade in
information, among other things. I have sources who tell me things.
Perhaps I can help. I would not charge, except to ask you to tell
me more of Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have helped too much already,&rdquo; Elayne said
hastily, remembering Nynaeve telling almost everything to Bayle
Domon. &ldquo;I <em>am</em> grateful, but we could not accept more.&rdquo;
Letting this woman know about the Black Ajah and letting her become
involved without knowing were equally out of the question. &ldquo;Truly
we could not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Caught with her mouth half-open, Nynaeve glared at
her. &ldquo;I was about to say the same,&rdquo; she said in a flat voice, then
went on more brightly. &ldquo;Our gratitude certainly extends to
answering questions, Egeanin. As much as we can.&rdquo; She surely meant
there were a good many questions for which they had no answers, but
Egeanin took it differently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. I will not pry into the secret affairs of
your White Tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem very interested in Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Elayne said.
&ldquo;I cannot sense the ability in you, but perhaps you can learn to
channel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egeanin almost dropped her porcelain cup. &ldquo;It&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;can be <em>learned</em>? I did not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;No. No, I do not want to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to learn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her agitation made Elayne sad. Even among people not
fearful of Aes Sedai, too many still feared anything to do with the
One Power. &ldquo;What <em>do</em> you want to know, Egeanin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before the woman could speak, a rap at the door was
followed by Thom, in the rich brown cloak he had taken to wearing
when he went out. It certainly attracted less notice than the
gleeman&rsquo;s patch-covered garment. In fact, it made him appear quite
dignified, with that mane of white hair, though he should brush it
more. Imagining him younger, Elayne thought she could see what had
first attracted her mother. That did not absolve him of leaving, of
course. She smoothed her face before he could see her frown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was told you were not alone,&rdquo; he said, giving
Egeanin a guarded look almost identical to Juilin&rsquo;s; men were
always suspicious of anyone they did not know. &ldquo;But I thought you
might like to hear that the Children of the Light surrounded the
Panarch&rsquo;s Palace this morning. The streets are beginning to buzz
over it. It seems the Lady Amathera is to be invested as Panarch
tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thom,&rdquo; Nynaeve said wearily, &ldquo;unless this Amathera
is really Liandrin, I do not care if she becomes Panarch, King, and
Wisdom of the whole Two Rivers all rolled together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The interesting thing,&rdquo; Thom said, limping to the
table, &ldquo;is that rumor says the Assembly refused to choose Amathera.
Refused. So why is she being invested? Things this odd are worth
noting, Nynaeve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he started to lower himself into a chair, she said
quietly, &ldquo;We are having a private conversation, Thom, I am sure you
will find the common room more congenial.&rdquo; She took a sip of tea,
eyeing him over the cup in clear expectation of his departure.</p>

<p>Flushing, he levered himself back up without ever
having actually sat, but he did not leave immediately. &ldquo;Whether the
Assembly has changed its mind or not, this will likely cause riots.
The streets still believe Amathera has been rejected. If you must
insist on going out, you cannot go alone.&rdquo; He was looking at
Nynaeve, but Elayne had the impression that he almost put a hand on
her shoulder. &ldquo;Bayle Domon is mired in that little room down near
the docks, tying up his affairs in case he has to run, but he has
agreed to provide fifty picked men, tough fellows used to a brawl
and handy with knife or sword.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve opened her mouth, but Elayne cut her off. &ldquo;We
are grateful, Thom, to you and Master Domon both. Please tell him
we accept his kind and generous offer.&rdquo; Meeting Nynaeve&rsquo;s flat
stare, she added meaningfully, &ldquo;I would not want to be kidnapped on
the streets in broad daylight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Thom said. &ldquo;We would not want that.&rdquo; Elayne
thought she heard a half-said &ldquo;child&rdquo; at the end of that, and this
time he did touch her shoulder, a swift brush of fingers.
&ldquo;Actually,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;the men are already waiting in the street
outside. I am trying to find a carriage; those chairs are too
vulnerable.&rdquo; He seemed to know he had gone too far, bringing
Domon&rsquo;s men before they agreed, not to mention this talk of a
carriage without a hint of asking first, but he faced them like an
old wolf at bay, bushy eyebrows drawn down. &ldquo;I would&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;regret&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;personally, if anything happened to you. The carriage will be
here as soon as I can find a team. If there is one to be
found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eyes wide, Nynaeve was obviously teetering on the
edge of whether or not to give him an upbraiding he would never
forget, and Elayne would not have minded adding a gentler
admonishment. Somewhat gentler; child, indeed!</p>

<p>He took advantage of their hesitation to sweep a bow
that would have graced any palace and departed while he had the
chance.</p>

<p>Egeanin had set down her cup and was staring at them
in consternation. Elayne supposed they had not given a very good
appearance of being Aes Sedai, letting Thom bully them. &ldquo;I must
go,&rdquo; the woman said, rising and taking her staff from against the
wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you have not asked your questions,&rdquo; Elayne
protested. &ldquo;We owe you answers to them, at the very least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another time,&rdquo; Egeanin said after a moment. &ldquo;If it
is permitted, I will come another time. I need to learn about you.
You are not what I expected.&rdquo; They assured her she could come any
time they were there and tried to convince her to stay long enough
to finish her tea and cakes, but she was adamant that she had to
leave now.</p>

<p>Turning from seeing the woman to the door, Nynaeve
put her fists on her hips: &ldquo;Kidnap you? If you have forgotten,
Elayne, it was me those men tried to grab!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To take you out of the way so they could seize me,&rdquo;
Elayne said. &ldquo;If you have forgotten, I <em>am</em> the
Daughter-Heir of Andor. My mother would have made them wealthy to
have me back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Nynaeve muttered doubtfully. &ldquo;Well, at
least they were nothing to do with Liandrin. That lot wouldn&rsquo;t send
a pack of louts to try stuffing us in a sack. Why do men always do
things without asking? Does growing hair on their chests sap their
brains?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sudden change did not confuse Elayne. &ldquo;We do not
have to worry about finding bodyguards, at any rate. You do agree
they are necessary, even if Thom did overstep himself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo; Nynaeve had a remarkable dislike for
admitting she was wrong. Thinking those men had been after <em>
her</em>, for instance. &ldquo;Elayne, do you realize we still have
nothing except an empty house? If Juilin&mdash;or Thom&mdash;slips and lets himself be found out&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;We must find the Black
sisters without them suspecting, or we will never have a chance of
following them to whatever this thing is that&rsquo;s dangerous to
Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Elayne said patiently. &ldquo;We <em>have</em>
discussed it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The older woman frowned at nothing. &ldquo;We still have
not a glimmer as to what it is, or where.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if we could bag Liandrin and the rest right
this minute, we cannot leave it floating about out there, waiting
for someone else to find.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that, Nynaeve.&rdquo; Reminding herself to be
patient, Elayne softened her tone. &ldquo;We will find them. They must
make some sort of slip, and between Thom&rsquo;s rumors, and Juilin&rsquo;s
thieves, and Bayle Domon&rsquo;s sailors, we will learn of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s frown became thoughtful. &ldquo;Did you notice
Egeanin&rsquo;s eyes when Thom mentioned Domon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Do you think she knows him? Why would she not
say so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; Nynaeve said vexedly. &ldquo;Her face did
not change, but her eyes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She was startled. She knows him. I
wonder what&mdash;&rdquo; Someone tapped softly on the door. &ldquo;Is everyone
in Tanchico going to march in on us?&rdquo; she growled, jerking it
open.</p>

<p>Rendra gave a start at the look on Nynaeve&rsquo;s face,
but her ever-present smile returned immediately. &ldquo;Forgive me for
disturbing you, but there is the woman below who asks for you. Not
by name, but she describes you as you stand. She says that she
believes she knows you. She is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; That rosebud mouth tightened
in a slight grimace. &ldquo;I forgot to ask her name. This morning I am
the witless goat. She is a well-dressed woman, not yet to her
middle years. Not of Tarabon.&rdquo; She gave a little shiver. &ldquo;A stern
woman, I think. When first she saw me, she looked at me as my older
sister did when we were children and she was thinking of tying my
braids to the bush.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or have they found us first?&rdquo; Nynaeve said
softly.</p>

<p>Elayne embraced the True Source before she thought of
it, and felt a shudder of relief that she could, that she had not
been shielded unaware. If the woman below was Black Ajah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;But
if she was, why announce herself? Even so, she wished the glow
of <em>saidar</em> surrounded Nynaeve, too. If only the woman could
channel without anger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send her in,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, and Elayne realized she
was very much aware of her lack, and afraid. As Rendra turned to
go, Elayne began weaving flows of Air, thick as cables and ready to
bind, flows of Spirit to shield another from the Source. If this
woman so much as resembled one on their list, if she tried to
channel a spark&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The woman who stepped into the Chamber of Falling
Blossoms, in a shimmering black silk gown of unfamiliar cut, was no
one Elayne had ever seen before, and surely not on the list of the
women who had gone with Liandrin. Dark hair spilling loose to her
shoulders framed a sturdily handsome face with large, dark eyes and
smooth cheeks, but not with Aes Sedai agelessness. Smiling, she
closed the door behind her. &ldquo;Forgive me, but I thought you
were&mdash;&rdquo; The glow of <em>saidar</em> surrounded her, and she&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elayne released the True Source. There was something
very commanding in those dark eyes, in the halo around her, the
pale radiance of the One Power. She was the most regal woman Elayne
had ever seen. Elayne found herself hurriedly curtsying, flushing
that she had considered&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;What had she considered? So hard to
think.</p>

<p>The woman studied them for a moment, then gave a
satisfied nod and swept to the table, taking the carved chair at
its head. &ldquo;Come here where I can see you both more closely,&rdquo; she
said in a peremptory voice. &ldquo;Come. Yes. That&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne realized she was standing beside the table,
looking down at the dark-eyed, glowing woman. She did hope that was
all right. On the other side of the table Nynaeve had a tangle of
her long, thin braids gripped in her fist, but she stared at the
visitor with a foolishly rapt expression. It made Elayne want to
giggle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About what I have come to expect,&rdquo; the woman said.
&ldquo;Little more than girls, and obviously not close to half-trained.
Strong, though; strong enough to be more than troublesome.
Especially you.&rdquo; She fixed Nynaeve with her eyes. &ldquo;You might become
something one day. But you&rsquo;ve blocked yourself, haven&rsquo;t you? We
would have had that out of you though you howled for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve still had that tight hold on her braids, but
her face went from a pleased, girlish smile at praise to shamed
lip-trembling. &ldquo;I am sorry I blocked myself,&rdquo; she almost whimpered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of it . . all that power&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the One Power&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;how
can I&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be silent unless I ask a question,&rdquo; the woman said
firmly. &ldquo;And do not start crying. You are joyful at seeing me,
ecstatic. All you want is to please me and answer my questions
truthfully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve nodded vigorously, smiling even more
rapturously than before. Elayne realized that she was, too. She was
sure she could answer the questions first. Anything to please this
woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now. Are you alone? Are there any other <em>Aes
Sedai</em> with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Elayne said quickly in answer to the first
question, and just as fast, to the second, &ldquo;There are no Aes Sedai
with us.&rdquo; Perhaps she should tell that they were not really Aes
Sedai either. But she had not been asked that. Nynaeve glared at
her, knuckles white on her braids, furious at being beaten to the
answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you in this city?&rdquo; the woman said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are hunting Black sisters,&rdquo; Nynaeve burst out,
shooting Elayne a triumphant look.</p>

<p>The handsome woman laughed. &ldquo;So that is why I have
not felt you channel before today. Wise of you to keep low when it
is eleven to two. I have always followed that policy myself. Let
other fools leap about in full view. They can be brought low by a
spider hiding in the cracks, a spider they never see until it is
too late. Tell me all you have discovered about these Black
sisters, all you know of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne spilled out everything, battling with Nynaeve
to be first. It was not very much. Their descriptions, the <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em> they had stolen, the murders in the Tower and the
fear of more Black sisters still there, aiding one of the Forsaken
in Tear before the Stone fell, their flight here seeking something
dangerous to Rand. &ldquo;They were all staying in a house together,&rdquo;
Elayne finished up, panting, &ldquo;but they left last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems you came very close,&rdquo; the woman said
slowly. &ldquo;Very close. <em>Ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. Turn out your purses on
the table, your pouches.&rdquo; They did, and she fingered quickly
through coins and sewing kits and handkerchiefs and the like. &ldquo;Do
you have any <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> in your rooms? <em>Angreal</em>
or <em>sa&rsquo;angreal?</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne was conscious of the twisted stone ring
hanging between her breasts, but that was not the question. &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
she said. They had none of those things in their room.</p>

<p>Pushing everything away, the woman leaned back,
speaking half to herself. &ldquo;Rand al&rsquo;Thor. So that is his name now.&rdquo;
Her face crumpled in a momentary grimace. &ldquo;An arrogant man who
stank of piety and goodness. Is he still the same? No, do not
bother to answer that. An idle question. So Be&rsquo;lal is dead. The
other sounds like Ishamael, to me. All his pride at being only
half-caught, whatever the price&mdash;there was less human left in
him than any of us when I saw him again; I think he half-believed
he was the Great Lord of the Dark&mdash;all his three thousand
years of machinations, and it comes to an untaught boy hunting him
down. My way is best. Softly, softly, in the shadows. Something to
control a man who can channel. Yes, it would have to be that.&rdquo; Her
eyes turned sharp, studying them in turn. &ldquo;Now. What to do with
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne waited patiently. Nynaeve wore a silly smile,
her lips parted expectantly; it looked especially foolish with the
way she was gripping her braids.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are too strong to waste; you may be useful one
day. I would love to see Rahvin&rsquo;s eyes the day he meets you
unblocked,&rdquo; she told Nynaeve. &ldquo;I would put you off this hunt of
yours, if I could. A pity compulsion is so limited. Still, with the
little you have learned, you are too far behind to catch up now. I
suppose I must collect you later and see to your&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;retraining.&rdquo;
She stood, and suddenly Elayne&rsquo;s entire body tingled. Her brain
seemed to shiver; she was conscious of nothing but the woman&rsquo;s
voice, roaring in her ears from a great distance. &ldquo;You will pick up
your things from the table, and when you have replaced them where
they belong, you will remember nothing of what happened here except
that I came thinking you were friends I knew from the country. I
was mistaken, I had a cup of tea, and I left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne blinked and wondered why she was tying her
purse back beside her belt pouch. Nynaeve was frowning at her own
hands, adjusting her pouch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A nice woman,&rdquo; Elayne said, rubbing her forehead.
She had a headache coming on. &ldquo;Did she give her name? I don&rsquo;t
remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nice?&rdquo; Nynaeve&rsquo;s hand came up and gave a sharp tug
to her braids; she stared as if it had moved of its own accord. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;do not think she did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were we talking of when she came in?&rdquo; Egeanin
had just gone. What had it been?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember what I was about to say.&rdquo; Nynaeve&rsquo;s voice
firmed. &ldquo;We must find the Black sisters without them suspecting, or
we will never have a chance of following them to whatever this
thing is that&rsquo;s dangerous to Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Elayne said patiently. Had she said that
already? Of course not. &ldquo;We <em>have</em> discussed it.&rdquo;</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">At the arched gates leading from the inn&rsquo;s small
courtyard, Egeanin paused, studying the hard-faced men who lounged,
barefoot and often bare-chested, among the idlers on this side of
the narrow street. They looked as if they could use the curved
boarding swords hanging at their belts or thrust through their
sashes, but none of those faces looked familiar. If any of them had
been on Bayle Demon&rsquo;s ship when she took him and it to Falme, she
did not remember. If any had been, it was to be hoped none
connected a woman in a riding dress to the woman in armor who had
captured their vessel.</p>

<p>Suddenly she realized her palms were damp. Aes Sedai.
Women who could wield the Power, and not decently leashed. She had
sat at the same table with them, talked with them. They were not at
all what she had expected; she could not dig that thought out of
her head. They could channel, therefore they were dangerous to
proper order, therefore they must be safely leashed&mdash;and yet&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Not at all what she had been taught. It could be <em>
learned</em>. Learned! As long as she could avoid Bayle Domon&mdash;he would surely recognize her&mdash;she should be able to
return. She had to learn more. More than ever, she had to.</p>

<p>Wishing she had a hooded cloak, she took a firm grip
on her staff and started up the street, threading her way into the
passing throng. None of the sailors looked at her twice, and she
watched them to be sure.</p>

<p>She did not see the pale-haired man in filthy
Tanchican garb huddled against the front of a white-plastered
wineshop on the other side of the street. His eyes, blue above a
dingy veil and a thick mustache held in place with glue, followed
her before sliding back to the Three Plum Court. Standing, he
crossed the street, ignoring the disgusting way people brushed
against him. Egeanin had nearly spotted him when he had forgotten
himself enough to break that fool&rsquo;s arm. One of the Blood, as such
things were reckoned in these lands, reduced to begging and without
enough honor to open his veins. Disgusting. Perhaps he could learn
more of what she was up to, in this inn, once they realized he had
more coin than his clothes suggested.</p>
