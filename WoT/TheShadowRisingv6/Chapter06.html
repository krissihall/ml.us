<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">R</span>and
al&rsquo;Thor,&rdquo; Moiraine told the air in a low, tight
voice, &ldquo;is a mule-headed, stone-willed fool of a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a
man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne lifted her chin angrily. Her childhood nurse,
Lini, used to say you could weave silk from pig bristles before you
could make a man anything but a man. But that was no excuse for
Rand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We breed them that way in the Two Rivers.&rdquo; Nynaeve
was suddenly all half-suppressed smiles and satisfaction. She
seldom hid her dislike of the Aes Sedai half as well as she thought
she did. &ldquo;Two Rivers women never have any trouble with them.&rdquo; From
the startled look Egwene gave her, that was a lie big enough to
warrant having her mouth washed out.</p>

<p>Moiraine&rsquo;s brows drew down as if she were about to
reply to Nynaeve in harder kind. Elayne stirred, but she could not
find anything to say that would head off argument. Rand kept
dancing through her head. He had no right! But what right did she
have?</p>

<p>Egwene spoke instead. &ldquo;What did he do, Moiraine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai&rsquo;s eyes swung to Egwene, a stare so hard
that the younger woman stepped back and snapped her fan open,
nervously fluttering it at her face. But Moiraine&rsquo;s gaze settled on
Joiya and Amico, the one watching her warily, the other bound and
unaware of anything but the far wall.</p>

<p>Elayne gave a small start at realizing Joiya was not
bound. Hastily she checked the shield blocking the woman from the
True Source. She hoped none of the others had noticed her jump;
Joiya frightened her nearly to death, but Egwene and Nynaeve were
no more scared of the woman than Moiraine was. Sometimes it was
difficult being as brave as the Daughter-Heir of Andor should be;
she often found herself wishing she could manage as well as those
two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The guards,&rdquo; Moiraine muttered as if to herself. &ldquo;I
saw them in the corridor still, and never thought.&rdquo; She smoothed
her dress, composing herself with an obvious effort. Elayne did not
believe she had ever seen Moiraine so out of herself as tonight.
But then, the Aes Sedai had cause. <em>No more than I do. Or do
I?</em> She found herself trying not to meet Egwene&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>Had it been Egwene or Nynaeve or Elayne who was off
balance, Joiya would surely have said something, subtle and of two
meanings, calculated to upset them a little more. If they had been
alone, at least. With Moiraine, she only watched uneasily,
silently.</p>

<p>Moiraine walked the length of the table, her calm
restored. Joiya was nearly a head the taller, but had she also been
dressed in silks, there would have been no doubt which was in
command of the situation. Joiya did not quite draw back, but her
hands tightened on her skirts for a moment before she could master
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have made arrangements,&rdquo; Moiraine said quietly.
&ldquo;In four days you will be taken upriver by ship, to Tar Valon and
the Tower. There they are not so gentle as we have been. If you
have not found the truth so far, find it before you reach
Southharbor, or you will assuredly go to the gallows in the
Traitors&rsquo; Court. I will not speak to you again unless you send word
that you have something new to tell. And I do not want to hear a
word from you&mdash;not one word&mdash;unless it <em>is</em> new.
Believe me, it will save you pain in Tar Valon. Aviendha, will you
tell the captain to bring in two of his men?&rdquo; Elayne blinked as the
Aiel woman unfolded herself and vanished through the doorway;
sometimes Aviendha could be so still she seemed not to be
there.</p>

<p>Joiya&rsquo;s face worked as if she wanted to speak, but
Moiraine stared up at her, and finally the Darkfriend turned her
eyes away. They glittered like a raven&rsquo;s, full of black murder, but
she held her tongue.</p>

<p>To Elayne&rsquo;s eyes a golden-white glow suddenly
surrounded Moiraine, the glow of a woman embracing <em>saidar</em>.
Only another woman trained to channel could have seen it. The flows
holding Amico unraveled more quickly than Elayne could have
managed. She was stronger than Moiraine, potentially, at least. In
the Tower, the women teaching her had been almost unbelieving at
her potential, and at Egwene&rsquo;s and Nynaeve&rsquo;s. Nynaeve was the
strongest of them all&mdash;when she could manage to channel. But
Moiraine had the experience. What they were still learning to do,
Moiraine could do half asleep. Yet there were some things Elayne
could do, and the other two, that the Aes Sedai could not. It was a
small satisfaction in the face of how easily Moiraine cowed
Joiya.</p>

<p>Freed, able to hear, Amico turned and became aware of
Moiraine for the first time. With a squeak, she dropped a curtsy as
deep as any new novice. Joiya was glaring at the door, avoiding
anyone&rsquo;s gaze. Nynaeve, arms crossed and knuckles white from
gripping her braid, was giving Moiraine a stare almost as murderous
as Joiya&rsquo;s. Egwene fingered her skirt and glowered at Joiya; Elayne
frowned, wishing she were as brave as Egwene, wishing she did not
feel she was betraying her friend. Into that walked the captain
with two more Defenders in black and gold on his heels. Aviendha
was not with them; it seemed she had taken her opportunity to
escape Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>The grizzled officer, two short white plumes on his
rimmed helmet, shied as his eyes met Joiya&rsquo;s, though she did not
even seem to see him. His gaze skittered from woman to woman
uncertainly. The mood of the room was trouble, and a wise man did
not want any part of trouble among this sort of women. The two
soldiers clutched their tall spears to their sides almost as if
they feared they might have to defend themselves. Perhaps they did
fear it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will take these two back to their cells,&rdquo;
Moiraine told the officer curtly. &ldquo;Repeat your instructions. I want
no mistakes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ae&mdash;&rdquo; The captain&rsquo;s throat seemed to seize.
He gulped a breath. &ldquo;Yes, my Lady,&rdquo; he said, watching her anxiously
to see if that would do. When she only continued to look at him,
waiting, he gave an audible sigh of relief. &ldquo;The prisoners are to
talk to no one except myself, not even each other. Twenty men in
the guardroom and two outside each cell at all times, four if a
cell door has to be opened for any reason. I myself will watch
their food prepared and take it to them. All as you have commanded,
my Lady.&rdquo; A hint of question tinged his voice. A hundred rumors
floated through the Stone concerning the prisoners, and why two
women needed to be guarded so heavily. And there were whispered
stories about the Aes Sedai, each darker than the last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;Take them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not clear who was more eager to leave the
room, the prisoners or the guards. Even Joiya stepped quickly, as
if she could not bear keeping silent near Moiraine for another
moment.</p>

<p>Elayne was certain she had kept her face calm since
entering the room, but Egwene came to her, put an arm around her.
&ldquo;What is the matter, Elayne? You look about to cry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The concern in her voice made Elayne feel like
bursting into tears. <em>Light!</em> she thought. <em>I will not be
that silly. I will not!</em> &ldquo;<em>A weeping woman is a bucket with no
bottom</em>.&rdquo; Lini had been full of sayings like that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three times&mdash;&rdquo; Nynaeve burst out at Moiraine,
&ldquo;only three!&mdash;you have consented to help us question them.
This time you vanish before we begin, and now you calmly announce
you are sending them off to Tar Valon! If you will not help, at
least do not interfere!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not presume on the Amyrlin&rsquo;s authority too far,&rdquo;
Moiraine said coolly. &ldquo;She may have set you to chase Liandrin, but
you are still only Accepted, and woefully ignorant, whatever
letters you carry. Or did you mean to keep questioning them forever
before reaching a decision? You Two Rivers people seem to work at
avoiding decisions that must be made.&rdquo; Nynaeve opened and closed
her mouth, eyes bulging, as if wondering which accusation to answer
first, but Moiraine turned to Egwene and Elayne. &ldquo;Pull yourself
together, Elayne. How you can carry out the Amyrlin&rsquo;s orders if you
think every land has the customs you were born to, I do not know.
And I do not know why you are so upset. Do not let your feelings
hurt others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Egwene said. &ldquo;What customs? What
are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Berelain was in Rand&rsquo;s chambers,&rdquo; Elayne said in a
small voice before she could stop herself. Her eyes flickered
guiltily toward Egwene. Surely she had kept her own feelings
hidden.</p>

<p>Moiraine gave her a reproachful look and sighed. &ldquo;I
would have spared you this if I could, Egwene. If Elayne had not
let her disgust with Berelain overcome her sense. The customs of
Mayene are not those either of you were born to. Egwene, I know
what you feel for Rand, but you must realize by now that nothing
can come of it. He belongs to the Pattern, and to history.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seemingly ignoring the Aes Sedai, Egwene peered into
Elayne&rsquo;s eyes. Elayne wanted to look away, and could not. Suddenly
Egwene leaned closer, whispering behind a cupped hand. &ldquo;I love him.
Like a brother. And you like a sister. I wish you well of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s eyes widened, a smile spreading slowly
across her face. She answered Egwene&rsquo;s hug with a fierce hug of her
own. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she murmured softly. &ldquo;I love you too, sister. Oh,
thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She got it wrong,&rdquo; Egwene said half to herself, a
delighted grin blooming on her face. &ldquo;Have you ever been in love,
Moiraine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>What a startling question. Elayne could not imagine
the Aes Sedai in love. Moiraine was Blue Ajah, and it was said Blue
sisters gave all their passions to causes.</p>

<p>The slender woman was not at all taken aback. For a
long moment she looked levelly at the pair of them, each with an
arm around the other. Finally she said, &ldquo;I could wager I know the
face of the man I will marry better than either of you knows that
of your future husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene gaped in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Elayne gasped.</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai appeared regretful of having spoken.
&ldquo;Perhaps I only meant we share an ignorance. Do not read too much
into a few words.&rdquo; She looked at Nynaeve consideringly. &ldquo;Should I
ever choose a man&mdash;should, I say&mdash;it will not be Lan.
That much I will say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was a sop to Nynaeve, but Nynaeve did not seem
to like hearing it. Nynaeve had what Lini would have called &ldquo;a hard
patch to hoe,&rdquo; loving not just a Warder but a man who tried to deny
returning her love. Fool man that he was, he talked of the war
against the Shadow he could not stop fighting and could never win,
of refusing to dress Nynaeve in widow&rsquo;s clothes for her wedding
feast. Silly things of that sort. Elayne did not see how Nynaeve
put up with it. She was not a very patient woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are finished chatting about men,&rdquo; Nynaeve
said acidly, as though to prove just that, &ldquo;perhaps we can go back
to what is important?&rdquo; Gripping her braid hard, she picked up speed
and force as she went along, like a waterwheel with the gears
disengaged. &ldquo;How are we to decide whether Joiya is lying, or Amico,
if you send them away? Or whether they both are? Or neither? I
don&rsquo;t relish dithering here, Moiraine, no matter what you think,
but I have walked into too many traps to want to walk into another.
And I don&rsquo;t want to run after Jak-o&rsquo;-the-Wisps, either. I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;we&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;are the ones the Amyrlin sent after Liandrin and her cronies.
Since you don&rsquo;t seem to think they are important enough to spare
more than a moment to help us, the least you can do is not crack
our ankles with a broom!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She seemed about to rip that braid free and try to
strangle the Aes Sedai with it, and Moiraine wore a dangerously
cool crystalline calm that suggested she might be ready to teach
again the lesson on holding her tongue that she had taught Joiya.
It was, Elayne decided, time for her to stop moping. She did not
know how she had fallen into the role of peacemaker among these
women&mdash;sometimes she wanted to take them all by the scruff of
the neck and shake them&mdash;but her mother always said no good
decision was ever made in anger. &ldquo;You might add to your list of
what you want to know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;why were we summoned to Rand?
That is where Careen took us. He is all right, now, of course.
Moiraine Healed him.&rdquo; She could not repress a shudder, thinking of
her brief glimpse inside his chamber, but the diversion worked a
charm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Healed!&rdquo; Nynaeve gasped. &ldquo;What happened to him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He almost died,&rdquo; the Aes Sedai said, as calmly as if
she were saying he had a pot of tea.</p>

<p>Elayne felt Egwene tremble as they listened to
Moiraine&rsquo;s dispassionate report, but perhaps some of the trembling
was her own. Bubbles of evil drifting through the Pattern,
Reflections leaping out of mirrors. Rand a mass of blood and
wounds. Almost as an afterthought, Moiraine added that she was sure
Perrin and Mat had experienced something of the same, but escaped
unharmed. The woman must have ice instead of blood. <em>No, she was
heated enough about Rand&rsquo;s stubbornness. And she wasn&rsquo;t cold when
she spoke of marrying, however much she pretended to be</em>. But
now she could have been discussing whether a bolt of silk was the
right color for a dress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And these&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;these <em>things</em> will keep on?&rdquo;
Egwene said when Moiraine finished. &ldquo;Is there nothing you can do to
stop it? Or that Rand can do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The small blue stone dangling from Moiraine&rsquo;s hair
swung as she shook her head. &ldquo;Not until he learns to control his
abilities. Perhaps not then. I do not know if even he will be
strong enough to push the miasma away from himself. At the least,
though, he will be better able to defend himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you do something to help him?&rdquo; Nynaeve
demanded. &ldquo;You are the one of us who is supposed to know
everything, or pretends to. Can&rsquo;t you teach him? Some part of it,
anyway? And don&rsquo;t quote proverbs about birds teaching fish to
fly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would know better,&rdquo; Moiraine replied, &ldquo;if you
had taken the advantage of your studies that you should have. You
should know better. You want to know how to use the Power, Nynaeve,
but you do not care to learn <em>about</em> the Power. <em>
Saidin</em> is not <em>saidar</em>. The flows are different, the
ways of weaving are different. The bird has a better chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This time Egwene took a turn at diffusing tension.
&ldquo;What is Rand being stubborn about, now?&rdquo; Nynaeve opened her mouth,
and she added, &ldquo;He can be stubborn as a stone, sometimes.&rdquo; Nynaeve
shut her mouth with a snap; they all knew how true that was.</p>

<p>Moiraine eyed them, considering. At times, Elayne was
not sure how much the Aes Sedai trusted them. Or anyone. &ldquo;He must
move,&rdquo; the Aes Sedai said at last. &ldquo;Instead he sits here, and the
Tairens already begin to lose their fear of him. He sits here, and
the longer he sits, doing nothing, the more the Forsaken will see
his inaction as a sign of weakness. The Pattern moves and flows;
only the dead are still. He must act, or he will die. From a
crossbow bolt in his back, or poison in his food, or the Forsaken
banding together to rip his soul from his body. He must act or
die.&rdquo; Elayne winced at each danger on her list; that they were real
only made it worse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you know what he must do, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Nynaeve
said tightly. &ldquo;You have this action planned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine nodded. &ldquo;Would you rather he go haring off
alone once more? I dare not risk it. This time he might be dead, or
worse, before I find him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was true enough. Rand hardly knew what he was
doing. And Elayne was sure Moiraine had no wish to lose the little
guidance she still gave him. The little he allowed her to give.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you share your plan for him with us?&rdquo; Egwene
demanded. She was certainly not helping soothe the air now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, do,&rdquo; Elayne said, surprising herself with a
cool echo of Egwene&rsquo;s tone. Confrontation was not her way when it
could be avoided; her mother always said it was better to guide
people than try to hammer them into line.</p>

<p>If their manner irritated Moiraine, she gave no sign
of it. &ldquo;As long as you understand that you must keep it to
yourselves. A plan revealed is a plan doomed to fail. Yes, I see
you do understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne certainly did; the plan was dangerous, and
Moiraine was not sure it would work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sammael is in Illian,&rdquo; the Aes Sedai went on. &ldquo;The
Tairens are always as ripe for war with Illian as the other way
around. They have been killing each other off and on for a thousand
years, and they speak of their chance for it as other men speak of
the next feastday. I doubt even knowing of Sammael&rsquo;s presence would
change that, not with the Dragon Reborn to lead them. Tear will
follow Rand eagerly enough in that enterprise, and if he brings
Sammael down, he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light!&rdquo; Nynaeve exclaimed. &ldquo;You not only want him to
start a war, you want him to seek out one of the Forsaken! No
wonder he is being stubborn. He is not a fool, for a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must face the Dark One in the end,&rdquo; Moiraine said
calmly. &ldquo;Do you truly think he can avoid the Forsaken now? As for
war, there are wars enough without him, and every one worse than
useless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any war is useless,&rdquo; Elayne began, then faltered as
comprehension suddenly filled her. Sadness and regret had to show
on her face, too, but certainly comprehension. Her mother had
lectured her often on how a nation was led as well as how it was
governed, two very different things, but both necessary. And
sometimes things had to be done for both that were worse than
unpleasant, although the price of not doing them was worse
still.</p>

<p>Moiraine gave her sympathetic look. &ldquo;It is not always
pleasant, is it? Your mother began when you were just old enough to
understand, I suppose, teaching you what you will need to rule
after her.&rdquo; Moiraine had grown up in the Royal Palace in Cairhien,
not destined to reign, but related to the ruling family and no
doubt overhearing the same lectures. &ldquo;Yet sometimes it seems
ignorance would be better, to be a farm woman knowing nothing
beyond the boundaries of her fields.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More riddles?&rdquo; Nynaeve said contemptuously. &ldquo;War
used to be something I heard about from peddlers, something far
away that I didn&rsquo;t really understand. I know what it is, now. Men
killing men. Men behaving like animals, reduced to animals.
Villages burned, farms and fields burned. Hunger, disease and
death, for the innocent as the guilty. What makes this war of yours
better, Moiraine? What makes it cleaner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elayne?&rdquo; Moiraine said quietly.</p>

<p>She shook her head&mdash;she did not want to be the
one to explain this&mdash;but she was not sure even her mother
sitting on the Lion Throne could have kept silent under Moiraine&rsquo;s
compelling, dark-eyed stare. &ldquo;War will come whether Rand begins it
or not,&rdquo; she said reluctantly. Egwene stepped back a pace, staring
at her in disbelief no sharper than that on Nynaeve&rsquo;s face; the
incredulity faded from both women as she continued. &ldquo;The Forsaken
will not stand idly and wait. Sammael cannot be the only one to
have seized a nation&rsquo;s reins, just the lone one we know. They will
come after Rand eventually, in their own persons perhaps, but
certainly with whatever armies they command. And the nations that
are free of the Forsaken? How many will cry glory to the Dragon
banner and follow him to Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don, and how many will convince
themselves the fall of the Stone is a lie and Rand only another
false Dragon who must be put down, a false Dragon perhaps strong
enough to threaten them if they do not move against him first? One
way or another, war <em>will</em> come.&rdquo; She cut off sharply. There
was more to it, but she could not, would not, tell them that
part.</p>

<p>Moiraine was not so reticent. &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; she said,
nodding, &ldquo;yet incomplete.&rdquo; The look she gave Elayne said she knew
Elayne had left out what she had on purpose. Hands folded calmly at
her waist, she addressed Nynaeve and Egwene. &ldquo;Nothing makes this
war better, or cleaner. Except that it will cement the Tairens to
him, and the Illianers will end up following him just as the
Tairens do now. How could they not, once the Dragon banner flies
over Illian? Just the news of his victory might decide the wars in
Tarabon and Arad Doman in his favor; there are wars <em>ended</em>
for you.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In one stroke he will make himself so strong in
terms of men and swords that only a coalition of every remaining
nation from here to the Blight can defeat him, and with the same
blow he shows the Forsaken that he is not a plump partridge on a
limb for the netting. That will make them wary, and buy him time to
learn to use his strength. He must move first, be the hammer, not
the nail.&rdquo; The Aes Sedai grimaced slightly, a hint of her earlier
anger marring her calm. &ldquo;He <em>must</em> move first. And what does
he do? He reads. Reads himself into deeper trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve looked shaken, as if she could see all the
battles and death; Egwene&rsquo;s dark eyes were large with horrified
understanding. Their faces made Elayne shiver. One had watched Rand
grow up, the other had grown up with him. And now they saw him
starting wars. Not the Dragon Reborn, but Rand al&rsquo;Thor.</p>

<p>Egwene struggled visibly, latching onto the smallest
part, the most inconsequential, of what Moiraine had said. &ldquo;How can
reading put him in trouble?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has decided to find out for himself what the
Prophecies of the Dragon say.&rdquo; Moiraine&rsquo;s face remained cool and
smooth, but suddenly she sounded almost as tired as Elayne felt.
&ldquo;They may have been proscribed in Tear, but the Chief Librarian had
nine different translations in a locked chest. Rand has them all,
now. I pointed out the verse that applies here, and he quoted it to
me, from an old Kandori translation.</p>

<p class="verse_quote">&ldquo;Power of the Shadow made human flesh,<br>
wakened to turmoil, strife and ruin.<br>
The Reborn One, marked and bleeding,<br>
 dances the sword in dreams and mist,<br>
chains the Shadowsworn to his will,<br>
from the city, lost and forsaken,<br>
leads the spears to war once more,<br>
breaks the spears and makes them see,<br>
truth long hidden in the
ancient dream</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She grimaced. &ldquo;It applies to this as well as it does
to anything. Illian under Sammael is surely a forsaken city. Lead
the Tairen spears to war, chain Sammael, and he has fulfilled the
verse. The ancient dream of the Dragon Reborn. But he will not see
it. He even has a copy in the Old Tongue, as if he understood two
words. He runs after shadows, and Sammael, or Rahvin, or Lanfear
may have him by the throat before I can convince him of his
mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is desperate.&rdquo; Nynaeve&rsquo;s gentle tone was not for
Moiraine, Elayne was sure, but for Rand. &ldquo;Desperate and trying to
find his way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I desperate,&rdquo; Moiraine said firmly. &ldquo;I have
dedicated my life to finding him, and I will not let him fail if I
can prevent it. I am almost desperate enough to&mdash;&rdquo; She broke
off, pursing her lips. &ldquo;Let it be enough that I will do what I
must.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t enough,&rdquo; Egwene said sharply. &ldquo;What is
it you&rsquo;ll do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have other matters to concern you,&rdquo; the Aes
Sedai said. &ldquo;The Black Ajah&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Elayne&rsquo;s voice was knife-edged and commanding,
her knuckles a hard white where she gripped her soft blue skirts.
&ldquo;You keep many secrets, Moiraine, but tell us this. What do you
mean to do to him?&rdquo; An image flashed in her mind of seizing
Moiraine and shaking the truth out of her if need be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do to him? Nothing. Oh, very well. There is no
reason you should not know. You have seen what the Tairens call the
Great Holding?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oddly for a people that feared the Power so, the
Tairens held in the Stone a collection of objects connected to the
Power second only to that in the White Tower. Elayne, for one,
thought it was because they had been forced to guard <em>
Callandor</em> so long, whether they wanted or not. Even the Sword
That Is Not a Sword might seem less than what it was when it was
one among many. But the Tairens had never been able to make
themselves display their prizes. The Great Holding was kept in a
filthy series of crowded rooms buried even deeper than the
dungeons. When Elayne had first seen them the locks on the doors
had long since rusted shut, where the doors had not simply
collapsed from dry rot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We spent an entire day down there,&rdquo; Nynaeve said.
&ldquo;To see if Liandrin and her <em>friends</em> took anything. I don&rsquo;t
think they did. Everything was buried in dust and mold. It will
take ten riverboats to transport all of it to the Tower. Perhaps
they can make some sense of it there; I surely could not.&rdquo; The
temptation to prod Moiraine was apparently too great to avoid, for
she added, &ldquo;You would know all this if you had given us a little
more of your time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine took no notice. She seemed to be looking
inward, examining her own thoughts, and she spoke almost to
herself. &ldquo;There is one particular <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> in the
Holding, a thing like a redstone doorframe, subtly twisted to the
eye. If I cannot make him reach <em>some</em> decision, I may have
to step through.&rdquo; The small blue stone on her forehead trembled,
sparkling. Apparently she was not eager to take that step.</p>

<p>At the mention of <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, Egwene
instinctively touched the bodice of her dress. She had sewn a small
pocket there herself, to hide the stone ring it now held. That ring
was a <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, powerful in its way if small, and
Elayne was one of only three women who knew she had it. Moiraine
was not one of the three.</p>

<p>They were strange things, <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>,
fragments of the Age of Legends like <em>angreal</em> and <em>
sa&rsquo;angreal</em>, if more numerous. <em>Ter&rsquo;angreal</em> used the
One Power instead of magnifying it. Each had apparently been made
to do one thing and one thing alone, but though some were used now,
no one was sure if those uses were anything like what they had been
made for. The Oath Rod, on which a woman took the Three Oaths on
being raised Aes Sedai, was a <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> that made those
oaths a part of her flesh and bone. The last test a novice took on
being raised to Accepted was inside another <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>
that ferreted out her most heartfelt fears and made them seem real&mdash;or perhaps took her to a place where they <em>were</em>
real. Odd things could happen with <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. Aes Sedai
had been burned out or killed, or had simply vanished, in studying
them. And in using them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw that doorway,&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;In the last room
at the end of the hall. My lamp went out, and I fell three times
before I made it to the door.&rdquo; A slight flush of embarrassment
reddened her cheeks. &ldquo;I was afraid to channel in there, even to
relight the lamp. Much of it looks rubbish, to me&mdash;I think
the Tairens simply grabbed anything that anyone hinted might be
connected to the Power&mdash;but I thought if I channeled, I might
accidentally empower something that wasn&rsquo;t rubbish, and who knows
what it might do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if you had stumbled in the dark and fallen
through the twisted doorway?&rdquo; Moiraine said wryly. &ldquo;That needs no
channeling, only to step through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To what purpose?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To gain answers. Three answers, each true, about
past, present or future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s first thought was for the children&rsquo;s tale,
<em>Bili Under the Hill</em>, but only because of the three
answers. A second thought came on its heels, and not to her alone.
She spoke while Nynaeve and Egwene were still opening their mouths.
&ldquo;Moiraine, this solves our problem. We can ask whether Joiya or
Amico is telling the truth. We can ask where Liandrin and the
others are. The names of the Black Ajah still in the Tower&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can ask what this thing is that is dangerous to
Rand,&rdquo; Egwene put in, and Nynaeve added, &ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you told us
of this before? Why have you let us go on listening to the same
tales day after day when we could have settled it all by now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai winced and threw up her hands. &ldquo;You
three rush in blindly where Lan and a hundred Warders would tread
warily. Why do you think I have not stepped through? Days ago I
could have asked what Rand must do to survive and triumph, how he
can defeat the Forsaken and the Dark One, how he can learn to
control the Power and hold off madness long enough to do what he
must.&rdquo; She waited, hands on hips, while it sank in. None of them
spoke. &ldquo;There are rules,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;and dangers. No one may
step through more than once. Only once. You may ask three
questions, but you must ask all three and hear the answers before
you may leave. Frivolous questions are punished, it seems, but it
also seems what may be serious for one can be frivolous coming from
another. Most importantly, questions touching the Shadow have dire
consequences.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you asked about the Black Ajah, you might be
returned dead, or come out a gibbering madwoman, if you came out at
all. As for Rand&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I am not certain it is possible to ask a
question about the Dragon Reborn that does not touch the Shadow in
some way. You see? Sometimes there are reasons for caution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know all this?&rdquo; Nynaeve demanded.
Planting fists on hips she confronted the Aes Sedai. &ldquo;The High
Lords surely never let Aes Sedai study anything in the Holding.
From the filth down there, none of it has seen sunlight in a
hundred years or more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More, I should think,&rdquo; Moiraine told her calmly.
&ldquo;They ceased their collecting nearly three hundred years gone. It
was just before they stopped completely that they acquired this
<em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. Up until then it was the possession of the
Firsts of Mayene, who used its answers to help keep Mayene out of
Tear&rsquo;s grasp. And they allowed Aes Sedai to study it. In secret, of
course; Mayene has never dared anger Tear too openly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it was so important to Mayene,&rdquo; Nynaeve said
suspiciously, &ldquo;why is it here, in the Stone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because Firsts have made bad decisions as well as
good in trying to keep Mayene free of Tear. Three hundred years ago
the High Lords were planning to build a fleet to follow Mayener
ships and find the oilfish shoals. Halvar, the then First, raised
the price of Mayener lamp oil well above that of oil from Tear&rsquo;s
olives, and to further convince the High Lords that Mayene would
always put its own interests behind those of Tear, made them a gift
of the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. He had already used it, so it was no
further good to him, and he was almost as young as Berelain is now,
apparently with a long reign ahead of him and many years of needing
Tairen goodwill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was a fool,&rdquo; Elayne muttered. &ldquo;My mother would
never make such a mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;But then, Andor is not
a small nation cornered by a much larger and stronger. Halvar <em>
was</em> a fool as it turned out&mdash;the High Lords had him
assassinated the very next year&mdash;but his foolishness does
present me with an opportunity, if I need it. A dangerous one, yet
better than none.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve muttered to herself, perhaps disappointed
that the Aes Sedai had not tripped herself up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It leaves the rest of us right where we were.&rdquo;
Egwene sighed. &ldquo;Not knowing who is lying, or whether they both
are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Question them again, if you wish,&rdquo; Moiraine said.
&ldquo;You have until they are put on the ship, though I very much doubt
either will change her tale now. My advice is to concentrate on
Tanchico. If Joiya speaks truly, it will take Aes Sedai and Warders
to guard Mazrim Taim, not just the three of you. I sent a warning
to the Amyrlin by pigeon when I first heard Joiya&rsquo;s story. In fact,
I sent three pigeons, to make sure one reaches the Tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So kind of you to keep us informed,&rdquo; Elayne murmured
coolly. The woman did go her own way. Just because they were only
pretending to be full Aes Sedai was no reason for Moiraine to keep
them in the dark. The Amyrlin had sent <em>them</em> out to hunt
the Black Ajah.</p>

<p>Moiraine inclined her head briefly, as if accepting
the thanks for real. &ldquo;You are welcome. Remember that you are the
hounds the Amyrlin set after the Black Ajah.&rdquo; Her slight smile at
Elayne&rsquo;s start said she knew exactly what Elayne had been thinking.
&ldquo;The decision on where to course must be yours. You have pointed
that out to me, as well,&rdquo; she added drily. &ldquo;I trust it will prove
an easier decision than mine. And I trust you will sleep well, what
sleep is left before daybreak. A good night to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That woman&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Elayne muttered when the door
had closed behind the Aes Sedai. &ldquo;Sometimes I could almost strangle
her.&rdquo; She dropped into one of the chairs at the table and sat
frowning at her hands in her lap.</p>

<p>Nynaeve gave a grunt that might have been agreement
as she went to a narrow table against the wall where silver goblets
and spice jars stood next to two pitchers. One pitcher, full of
wine, rested in a gleaming bowl of now mostly melted ice, brought
all the way from the Spine of the World packed in chests of
sawdust. Ice in the summer to chill a High Lord&rsquo;s drink; Elayne
could barely imagine such a thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A cool drink before bed will do us all good,&rdquo;
Nynaeve said, busying herself with wine and water and spices.</p>

<p>Elayne lifted her head as Egwene took a seat next to
her. &ldquo;Did you mean what you said, Egwene? About Rand?&rdquo; Egwene
nodded, and Elayne sighed. &ldquo;Do you remember what Min used to say,
all her jokes about sharing him? I sometimes wondered if that was a
viewing she did not tell us about. I thought she meant we both
loved him, and she knew it. But you had the right to him, and I
didn&rsquo;t know what to do. I still don&rsquo;t. Egwene, he loves you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will just have to be put straight,&rdquo; Egwene said
firmly. &ldquo;When I marry, it will be because I want to, not just
because a man expects me to love him. I will be gentle with him,
Elayne, but before I am done, he will know he is free. Whether he
wants to be or not. My mother says men are different from us. She
says we want to be in love, but only with the one we want; a man
needs to be in love, but he will love the first woman to tie a
string to his heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all very well,&rdquo; Elayne said in a tight
voice, &ldquo;but Berelain was in his chambers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene sniffed. &ldquo;Whatever she intends, Berelain won&rsquo;t
keep her mind on one man long enough to make him love her. Two days
ago she was casting eyes at Rhuarc. In two more, she&rsquo;ll be smiling
at someone else. She is like Else Grinwell. You remember her? The
novice who spent all her time out at the practice yards fluttering
her eyelashes at the Warders?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was not just fluttering her eyelashes, in his
bedchamber at this hour. She was wearing even less than usual, if
that is possible!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to let her have him, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Elayne said it very fiercely, and she meant it,
but in the next breath she was full of despair. &ldquo;Oh, Egwene, I do
not know what to do. I love him. I want to marry him. Light! What
will mother say? I would rather spend a night in Joiya&rsquo;s cell than
listen to the lectures mother will give me.&rdquo; Andoran nobles, even
in royal families, married commoners often enough that it hardly
occasioned comment&mdash;in Andor, at least&mdash;but Rand was
not exactly the usual run of commoner. Her mother was quite capable
of actually sending Lini to drag her home by her ear&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Morgase can hardly say much if Mat is to be
believed,&rdquo; Egwene said comfortingly. &ldquo;Or even half believed. This
Lord Gaebril your mother is mooning after hardly sounds the choice
of a woman thinking with her head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure Mat exaggerated,&rdquo; Elayne replied primly.
Her mother was too shrewd to make herself a fool over any man. If
Lord Gaebril&mdash;she had never even heard of him before Mat
spoke his name&mdash;if this fellow dreamed he could gain power
through Morgase, she would give him a rude awakening.</p>

<p>Nynaeve brought three goblets of spiced wine to the
table, beads of condensation running down their shining sides, and
small green-and-gold woven straw mats to put them on so the damp
would not mar the table&rsquo;s polish. &ldquo;So,&rdquo; she said, taking a chair,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve discovered you are in love with Rand, Elayne, and Egwene
has discovered she isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two younger women gaped at her, one dark, the
other fair, yet a near mirror image of astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have eyes,&rdquo; Nynaeve said complacently. &ldquo;And ears,
when you don&rsquo;t take the trouble to whisper.&rdquo; She sipped at her
wine, and her voice grew cold when she continued. &ldquo;What do you mean
to do about it? If that chit Berelain has her claws into him, it
will not be easy to pry them loose. Are you sure you want to go to
the effort? You know what he is. You know what lies ahead of him,
even setting the Prophecies aside. Madness. Death. How long does he
have? A year? Two? Or will it begin before summer&rsquo;s end? He is a
man who can channel.&rdquo; She bit off each word in tones of iron.
&ldquo;Remember what you were taught. Remember what he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne held her head high and met Nynaeve stare for
stare. &ldquo;It does not matter. Perhaps it should, but it doesn&rsquo;t.
Perhaps I am being foolish. I do not care. I cannot change my heart
to order, Nynaeve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly Nynaeve smiled. &ldquo;I had to be sure,&rdquo; she said
warmly. &ldquo;You must be sure. It isn&rsquo;t easy loving any man, but loving
this man will be harder yet.&rdquo; Her smile faded as she went on. &ldquo;My
first question still has to be answered. What do you mean to do
about it? Berelain may look soft&mdash;she certainly makes men see
her so!&mdash;but I do not think she is. She will fight for what
she wants. And she&rsquo;s the kind to hold hard to something she doesn&rsquo;t
particularly want, just because someone else does want it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like to stuff her in a barrel,&rdquo; Egwene said,
gripping her goblet as if it were the First&rsquo;s throat, &ldquo;and ship her
back to Mayene. In the bottom of the hold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s braid swung as she shook her head. &ldquo;All
very well, but try to offer advice that helps. If you cannot, keep
silent and let her decide what she must do.&rdquo; Egwene stared at her,
and she added, &ldquo;Rand is Elayne&rsquo;s to deal with, now, not yours. You
have stepped aside, remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The remark should have made Elayne smile, but it did
not. &ldquo;This was all supposed to be different.&rdquo; She sighed. &ldquo;I
thought I would meet a man, learn to know him over months or years,
and slowly I would come to realize I loved him. That is the way I
always thought it would be. I hardly know Rand. I&rsquo;ve talked with
him no more than half a dozen times in the space of a year. But I
knew I loved him five minutes after I first set eyes on him.&rdquo; Now
that <em>was</em> foolish. Only, it was true, and she did not care
if it was foolish. She would tell her mother the same to her face,
and Lini. Well, perhaps not Lini. Lini had drastic ways of dealing
with foolishness, and she seemed to think Elayne had not aged
beyond ten. &ldquo;As matters stand, though, I don&rsquo;t even have the right
to be angry with him. Or Berelain.&rdquo; But she was. <em>I would like
to slap his face till his ears ring for a year! I&rsquo;d like to switch
her all the way to the ship that takes her back to Mayene!</em>
Only, she did <em>not</em> have the right, and that made it all the
worse. Infuriatingly, a plaintive tone touched her voice. &ldquo;What can
I do? He has never looked at me twice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the Two Rivers,&rdquo; Egwene said slowly, &ldquo;if a woman
wants a man to know she is interested in him, she puts flowers in
his hair at Bel Tine or Sunday. Or she might embroider a feastday
shirt for him any time. Or make a point of asking him to dance and
no one else.&rdquo; Elayne gave her an incredulous look, and she hastened
to add, &ldquo;I am not suggesting you embroider a shirt, but there are
ways to let him know how you feel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mayeners believe in speaking out.&rdquo; Elayne&rsquo;s voice
held a brittle edge. &ldquo;Perhaps that is the best way. Just tell him
right out. At least he&rsquo;ll know how I feel, then. At least I&rsquo;ll have
some right to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She snatched her spiced wine and tilted her head
back, drinking. Speak out? Like some <em>Mayener</em> hussy!
Setting the empty goblet back on the small mat, she drew a deep
breath and murmured, &ldquo;What <em>will</em> Mother say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s more important,&rdquo; Nynaeve said gently, &ldquo;is
what you will do when we have to leave here. Whether it&rsquo;s Tanchico,
or the Tower, or somewhere else, we will have to go. What will you
do when you&rsquo;ve just told him you love him, and you must leave him
behind? If he asks you to stay with him? If you want to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go.&rdquo; There was no hesitation in Elayne&rsquo;s
reply, but a touch of asperity. The other woman should not have had
to ask. &ldquo;If I must accept him being the Dragon Reborn, he must
accept that I am what I am, that I have duties. I want to be Aes
Sedai, Nynaeve. It isn&rsquo;t some idle amusement. Neither is the work
we three have to do. Could you really think I would abandon you and
Egwene?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene hurried to assure her that the thought had
never crossed her mind; Nynaeve did the same, but slowly enough to
give herself the lie.</p>

<p>Elayne looked from one to the other of them. &ldquo;In
truth, I feared you might tell me I was foolish, fretting over a
thing like this when we have the Black Ajah to worry about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A slight flicker of Egwene&rsquo;s eyes said the thought
had occurred to her, but Nynaeve said, &ldquo;Rand is not the only one
who might die next year, or next month, We might, too. Times are not
what they were, and we cannot be, either. If you sit and wish for
what you want, you may not see it this side of the grave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a chilling sort of reassurance, but Elayne
nodded. She was <em>not</em> being silly. If only the Black Ajah
could be settled so easily. She pressed her empty silver goblet to
her forehead for the coolness. What were they to do?</p>
