<h4><em>Imre Stand</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
sun still stood more than its own height above
the jagged western horizon when Rhuarc said that Imre
Stand, where he intended to stay for the night, lay only a
mile or so ahead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are we stopping already?&rdquo; Rand asked. &ldquo;There are
hours more daylight left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Aviendha, walking along on the other side of
Jeade&rsquo;en from the clan chief, who answered, in the scornful tone he
had come to expect. &ldquo;There is water at Imre Stand. It is best to
camp near water when the chance presents itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the peddlers&rsquo; wagons cannot go much farther,&rdquo;
Rhuarc added. &ldquo;When the shadows lengthen, they must stop or begin
breaking wheels and mules&rsquo; legs. I do not want to leave them
behind. I cannot spare anyone to watch over them, and Couladin
can.&rdquo; Rand twisted in his saddle. Flanked now by Jindo <em>Duadhe
Mahdi&rsquo;in</em>, Water Seekers, the wagons were making heavy going a
few hundred paces off to the side, lurching along, raising a tall
plume of yellow dust. Most gullies were too deep or too
steep-walled, forcing the drivers to go around, so the train
twisted like a drunken snake. Loud curses floated from the
wavering line, most blaming the mules for it all. Kadere and Keille
were still inside their white-painted wagons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Rand said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t want to do that.&rdquo; He
laughed softly in spite of himself.</p>

<p>Mat was looking at him oddly from under the broad
brim of his new hat. He smiled in what he hoped was a reassuring
way, but Mat&rsquo;s expression did not change. <em>He&rsquo;s going to have to
take care of himself</em>, Rand thought. <em>Too much is riding on
this</em>.</p>

<p>Speaking of taking care, he became aware of Aviendha
studying him, her shawl wrapped around her head much like a <em>
shoufa</em>. He straightened himself again. Moiraine might have
told her off to nurse him, but he had the impression the woman was
waiting to see him fall. Doubtless she would find that funny, Aiel
humor being what it was. He would have liked to think she simply
resented being stuffed into a dress and set to watch him, but the
glitter in her eyes seemed too personal for that.</p>

<p>For once Moiraine and the Wise Ones were <em>not</em>
watching him. Halfway between the Jindo and the Shaido, Moiraine
and Egwene were walking with Amys and the others, all six women
looking at something in the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s hands. It caught the light
of the falling sun, sparkling like a gem; they certainly seemed as
intent as any girl on a pretty. Lan rode back among the <em>
gai&rsquo;shain</em> and packhorses, as though they had sent him
away.</p>

<p>The scene made Rand uneasy. He was used to being the
center of attention for that lot. What had they found more
interesting? Surely nothing he could be happy about, not with
Moiraine, likely not with Amys or the others. They all had their
plans for him. Egwene was the only one of them he really trusted.
<em>Light, I hope I can still trust her</em>. The only one he could
really trust was himself. <em>When the boar breaks cover, there&rsquo;s
only you and your spear</em>. His laugh was a touch bitter this
time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You find the Three-fold Land amusing, Rand al&rsquo;Thor?&rdquo;
Aviendha&rsquo;s smile was the merest flash of white teeth. &ldquo;Laugh while
you can, wetlander. When this land begins to break you, it will be
a fitting punishment for your treatment of Elayne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Why would the woman an not let up? &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t show
any respect for the Dragon Reborn,&rdquo; he snapped, &ldquo;but you could try
finding a little for the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rhuarc chuckled. &ldquo;A clan chief is not a wetlander
king Rand, nor is the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>. There is respect&mdash;though women generally show as little as they can get away with&mdash;but anyone can speak to a chief.&rdquo; Even so, he sent a frown
in the direction of the woman on the other side of Rand&rsquo;s horse.
&ldquo;Some do push the bounds of honor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha must have known that last was meant for her
ears; her face went stony. But she strode along without saying
another word, fists clenched at her sides.</p>

<p>A pair of the scouting Maidens appeared, coming back
at a dead run. They were plainly not together; one headed straight
for the Shaido, the other for the Jindo. Rand recognized her, a
yellow-haired woman named Adelin, handsome but hard-faced, with a
scar making a fine white line across her sun-dark cheek. She was
one of those who had been in the Stone, though older than most of
the Maidens there, perhaps ten years more than he. The quick look
she gave Aviendha before falling in beside Rhuarc, an equal blend
of curiosity and sympathy, made Rand bristle. If Aviendha had
agreed to do the Wise Ones&rsquo; spying, she certainly did not deserve
sympathy. His company was not so onerous as that. Him, Adelin
ignored altogether.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is trouble at Imre Stand,&rdquo; she told Rhuarc,
her speech quick and clipped. &ldquo;There is no one to be seen. We have
kept hidden and not gone close.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Rhuarc replied. &ldquo;Inform the Wise Ones.&rdquo;
Unconsciously hefting his spears, he dropped back to the main body
of Jindo. Aviendha muttered to herself, plucking at her skirts,
obviously wanting to join him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think they already know,&rdquo; Mat said as Adelin sped
toward the Wise Ones&rsquo; party.</p>

<p>From the agitation among the women around Moiraine,
Rand thought he was right. They all appeared to be talking at once.
Egwene was shading her eyes, staring at either Adelin or him, her
other hand to her mouth. How they knew had to be a question for
later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of trouble might it be?&rdquo; he asked
Aviendha. Still muttering to herself, she did not answer.
&ldquo;Aviendha? What kind of trouble?&rdquo; Nothing. &ldquo;Burn you, woman, you
can answer a simple question! What kind of trouble?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She flushed, but her reply came in a level tone. &ldquo;It
is most likely to be a raid, for goats or sheep; either could be
herded at Imre for pasture, but most likely goats, because of the
water. Probably it was the Chareen, the White Mountain sept or the
Jarra. They are closest. Or it might be a sept from the Goshien.
The Tomanelle are too far, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will there be fighting?&rdquo; He reached out for <em>
saidin</em>; the sweet rush of the Power flooded him. The rancid
taint oozed through him, and fresh sweat burst from every pore.
&ldquo;Aviendha?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Adelin would have said if the raiders were still
there. The herd and the <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> are miles gone by now.
We cannot recover the herd because we must accompany you. &rdquo;</p>

<p>He wondered why she did not mention recovering the
captives, the <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>, but he did not wonder long. The
effort of staying upright while holding on to <em>saidin</em>, of
not folding up and being swept away, left little room for
thought.</p>

<p>Rhuarc and the Jindo swept ahead at a run, already
veiling their faces, and Rand followed more slowly. Aviendha shot
him impatient frowns, but he kept Jeade&rsquo;en to a brisk walk. He
would not go galloping into someone else&rsquo;s trap. At least Mat was
in no hurry; he hesitated, looking at the peddlers&rsquo; wagons, before
cantering Pips up. Rand never glanced at the wagons.</p>

<p>The Shaido fell behind, slowing until the Wise Ones
began to move again. Of course. This was Taardad land. Couladin
would not care if someone raided here. Rand hoped the clan chiefs
could be gathered at Alcair Dal quickly. How could he unite a
people who seemed to fight each other all the time? The least of
his worries, now.</p>

<p>When Imre Stand finally came in sight, it was
something of a surprise. A few widely scattered clumps of
long-haired white goats browsed on patches of tough grass and even
the leaves of thorny bushes. At first he did not see the crude
stone building set against the base of a tall butte; the rough
stonework blended in perfectly, and several thornbushes had taken
root on the dirt covered roof. Not very big, it had arrowslits for
windows and only one door that he could see. After a moment he
spotted another building, no larger, tucked onto a ledge some
twenty paces higher. A deep crevice ran up to the ledge and beyond
from behind the stone house at the base; there was no other evident
way to reach the ledge.</p>

<p>Rhuarc, standing openly four hundred or so paces from
the butte with his veil lowered, was the only Jindo in sight. That
did not mean the others were not there, of course. Rand reined in
beside him and dismounted. The clan chief continued to study the
stone buildings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The goats,&rdquo; Aviendha said, sounding troubled.
&ldquo;Raiders would not have left any goats behind. Most are gone, but
it almost looks as if the herd has just been allowed to
wander.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For days,&rdquo; Rhuarc agreed, not taking his eyes from
the buildings, &ldquo;or more would remain. Why does no one come out?
They should be able to see my face, and know me.&rdquo; He started
forward, and made no objection when Rand joined him leading
Jeade&rsquo;en. Aviendha had one hand on her belt knife, and Mat, riding
behind, carried that black-hafted spear as if he expected to need
it.</p>

<p>The door was rough wood, pieced together from short,
narrow planks. Some of the stout bracing was broken, hacked by
axes. Rhuarc hesitated a moment before pushing it open. He hardly
glanced inside before turning to run his eyes over the surrounding
country.</p>

<p>Rand put his head in. There was no one there. The
interior, light streaming in bars through the arrowslits, was all
one room and plainly not a dwelling, just a place for herdsmen to
shelter, and defend themselves if attacked. There were no
furnishings, no tables or chairs. A raised open hearth stood
beneath a sooty smoke hole in the roof. The wide crevice at the
back had steps chiseled into the gray rock. The place had been
ransacked. Bedding, blankets, pots, all lay scattered across the
stone floor amid slashed cushions and pillows. Some liquid had been
splashed over everything, the walls, even the ceiling, and had
dried black.</p>

<p>When he realized what it was, he jerked back, the
Power-wrought sword coming into his hands before he even thought.
Blood. So much blood. There had been slaughter done here, as savage
as anything he could imagine. Nothing moved out there except the
goats.</p>

<p>Aviendha backed out as fast as she went in. &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
she demanded incredulously, her large blue-green eyes filled with
outrage. &ldquo;Who would do this? Where are the dead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trollocs,&rdquo; Mat muttered. &ldquo;It looks like Trolloc work
to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She snorted contemptuously. &ldquo;Trollocs do not come
into the Three-fold Land, wetlander. No more than a few miles below
the Blight, at least, and then seldom. I have heard they call the
Three-fold Land the Dying Ground. We hunt Trollocs, wetlander; they
do not hunt us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nothing moved. Rand let the sword go, pushed <em>
saidin</em> away. It was hard. The sweetness of the Power was
nearly enough to overcome the feel of filth from the taint, the
sheer exhilaration almost enough to make him not care. Mat was
right, whatever Aviendha said, but this was old, the Trollocs gone.
Trollocs in the Waste, at a place he had come to. He was not fool
enough to think it coincidence. <em>But if they think I am, maybe
they&rsquo;ll grow careless</em>.</p>

<p>Rhuarc signaled the Jindo to come in&mdash;they
seemed to rise out of the ground&mdash;and some time later the
others appeared, the Shaido and the peddlers&rsquo; wagons and the Wise
Ones&rsquo; party. Word spread quickly of what had been found, and among
the Aiel, tension became palpable. They moved as if they expected
momentary attack, perhaps from each other. Scouts fanned out in
every direction. Unharnessing their mules, the wagon drivers looked
around jerkily, and seemed ready to dive under their wagons at the
first shout.</p>

<p>For a time all was a stirred hive of ants. Rhuarc
made sure the peddlers lined their wagons up on the edge of the
Jindo camp. Couladin glowered, since it meant any Shaido who wanted
to trade had to go to the Jindo, but he did not argue. Perhaps even
he could see that might lead to dancing the spears, now. The Shaido
tents went up a scant quarter-mile away, with the Wise Ones, as
usual, in between. The Wise Ones examined the inside of the
building, and Moiraine and Lan did, as well, but if they reached
any conclusions, they told no one.</p>

<p>The water at Imre Stand turned out to be a tiny
spring at the back of the crevice, feeding a deep, roughly round
pool&mdash;what Rhuarc called a tank&mdash;less than two paces
across. Enough for herdsmen, enough for the Jindo to fill some of
their waterskins. No Shaido went near; in Taardad land, the Jindo
had first claim on water. It seemed the goats got their moisture
purely from the thick leaves of the thorny bushes. Rhuarc assured
Rand there would be much more water at the next night&rsquo;s stop.</p>

<p>Kadere produced a surprise while the wagon drivers
were unhitching their teams and fetching buckets from the
water-wagons. When he came out of his wagon, a dark-haired young
woman accompanied him, in a red silk gown and red velvet slippers
more suited to a palace than to the Waste. A filmy red scarf wound
almost like <em>shoufa</em> and veil provided no protection from
the sun, and certainly did nothing to hide a palely beautiful
heart-shaped face. Clinging to the peddler&rsquo;s thick arm, she swayed
enticingly as he took her to see the blood-splashed room; Moiraine
and the others had gone off to where the <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> were
erecting the Wise Ones&rsquo; camp. When the pair came back out, the
young woman shuddered delicately. Rand was sure it was pretense,
just as he was sure she had asked to view that butcher&rsquo;s workroom.
Her show of revulsion lasted all of two seconds, and then she was
peering about interestedly at the Aiel.</p>

<p>It appeared that Rand himself was one of the sights
she wanted to see. Kadere seemed ready to take her back to the
wagon, but she guided him to Rand instead, the alluring smile on
her full lips plain behind her diaphanous veil. &ldquo;Hadnan has been
telling me of you,&rdquo; she said in a smoky voice. She might have been
hanging on the peddler, but her dark eyes traced Rand boldly. &ldquo;You
are the one the Aiel talk of. He Who Comes With the Dawn.&rdquo; Keille
and the gleeman came out of the second wagon and stood together at
a distance, watching.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems I am,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strange.&rdquo; Her smile became wickedly mischievous. &ldquo;I
thought you would be handsomer.&rdquo; Patting Kadere on the cheek, she
sighed. &ldquo;This dreadful heat is so wearing. Do not be too long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kadere did not speak until she had climbed the steps
back inside. His hat had been replaced by a long white scarf tied
atop his head, the ends handing down his neck. &ldquo;You must forgive
Isendre, good sir. She is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;too forward, sometimes.&rdquo; His voice
was mollifying, but his eyes belonged on a bird of prey. He
hesitated, then went on. &ldquo;I have heard other things. I have heard
that you took <em>Callandor</em> out of the Heart of the
Stone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man&rsquo;s eyed never changed. If he knew about <em>
Callandor</em>, he knew Rand was the Dragon Reborn, knew he could
wield the One Power. And his eyes never changed. A dangerous man.
&ldquo;I have heard it said,&rdquo; Rand told him, &ldquo;that you should believe
nothing you hear, and only half of what you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A wise rule,&rdquo; Kadere said after a moment. &ldquo;Yet to
achieve greatly, a man must believe something. Belief and knowledge
pave the road to greatness. Knowledge is perhaps the most valuable
of all. We all seek the coin of knowledge. Your pardon, good sir.
Isendre is not a patient woman. Perhaps we will have another
opportunity to talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before the man had taken three steps, Aviendha said
in a low, hard voice, &ldquo;You belong to Elayne, Rand al&rsquo;Thor. Do you
stare so at every woman who comes in front of your eyes, or only
those who go half-naked? If I strip off my clothes, will you stare
so at me? You belong to Elayne!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had forgotten she was there. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t <em>
belong</em> to anyone, Aviendha. Elayne? She cannot seem to make up
her mind what she thinks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elayne laid her heart bare to you, Rand al&rsquo;Thor. If
she did not show you in the Stone of Tear, did her two letters not
tell you what she feels? You are hers, and no other&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand threw up his hands and stalked away from her. At
least, he tried. She followed on his heels, a disapproving shadow
in the sun&rsquo;s glare.</p>

<p>Swords. The Aiel might have forgotten why they did
not carry swords, but they had kept the contempt for them. Swords
might make her leave him alone. Seeking out Lan in the Wise Ones&rsquo;
camp, he asked the Warder to watch him work the forms. Bair was the
only one of the four in view, and a scowl surely deepened the
creases on her face. Egwene was not to be seen either. Moiraine
wore calm like a mask, dark eyes cool; he could not say whether she
approved.</p>

<p>He was not out to offend the Aiel, so he set up with
Lan between the Wise Ones&rsquo; tents and the Jindo&rsquo;s. He used one of
the practice swords Lan carried in his baggage, a bundle of loosely
tied lathes in place of a blade. The weight and balance were right,
though, and he could forget himself in the dance-like flow from
form to form, the practice sword alive in his hands, a part of him.
Usually it was that way. Today the sun was a furnace in the sky
baking out moisture and strength. Aviendha squatted off to one
side, hugging her knees to her chest and staring at him.</p>

<p>Finally, panting, he let his arms drop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You lost concentration,&rdquo; Lan told him. &ldquo;You must
hold on to that even when your muscles turn to water. Lose it, and
that is the day you die. And it will probably be a farmboy who has
his hands on a sword for the first time who does it.&rdquo; His smile was
sudden, odd on that stony face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Well, I&rsquo;m not a farmboy any longer, am I?&rdquo; They
had gained an audience, if at a distance. Aiel lined the edge of
both the Shaido and Jindo camps. Keille&rsquo;s cream-wrapped bulk stood
out among the Jindo, the gleeman beside her in his cloak of colored
patches. Which one did he choose? He did not want them to see him
watching them. &ldquo;How do Aiel fight, Lan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hard,&rdquo; the Warder said dryly. &ldquo;They never lose
concentration. Look here.&rdquo; With his sword he drew on the hard,
cracked clay, a circle and arrows. &ldquo;Aiel change tactics according
to circumstances, but here is one they favor. They move in a
column, divided into quarters. When they meet an enemy, the first
quarter rushes in to pin them. The second and third sweep wide to
either side, hitting the flanks and rear. The last quarter waits in
reserve, often not even watching the battle, except for their
leader. When a weakness opens&mdash;a hole, anything&mdash;the
reserve strikes there. Finish!&rdquo; His sword stabbed into a circle
already pierced with arrows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you beat that?&rdquo; Rand asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With difficulty. When you make first contact&mdash;you&rsquo;ll not spot Aiel before they strike unless you are lucky&mdash;immediately send out horsemen to break up, or at least delay, their
flanking attacks. If you keep most of your strength back and defeat
the holding attack, then you can wheel on the others in turn and
defeat them, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you want to learn how to fight Aiel?&rdquo;
Aviendha burst out. &ldquo;Are you not He Who Comes With the Dawn, meant
to bind us together and return us all to old glories? Besides, if
you want to know how to fight Aiel, ask Aiel, not a wetlander. His
way will not work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has worked well enough with Bordermen from time
to time.&rdquo; Rhuarc&rsquo;s soft boots made very little sound on the hard
ground. He had a waterskin under his arm. &ldquo;Allowances are always
made when someone suffers a disappointment, Aviendha, but there is
a limit to sulking. You gave up the spear for your obligation to
the people and the blood. One day no doubt you will be making a clan
chief do what you want instead of what he wants, but if instead you
are Wise One to the smallest hold of the smallest sept of the
Taardad, the obligation remains, and it cannot be met by
tantrums.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A Wise One. Rand felt a fool. Of course that was why
she had gone to Rhuidean. But he would never have thought Aviendha
would choose to give up the spear. It certainly explained why she
had been chosen to spy on him, though. Suddenly he found himself
wondering if she could channel. It seemed Min had been the only
woman in his life since that Winternight who could not.</p>

<p>Rhuarc tossed him the sloshing waterskin. The
lukewarm water slid down his throat like chilled wine. He tried not
to splash any over his face, not to waste it, but it was hard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you might like to learn the spear,&rdquo; Rhuarc
said when Rand finally lowered the half-empty skin. For the first
time Rand realized the clan chief was carrying only two spears, and
a pair of bucklers. Not practice spears, if there were any such; a
foot of sharp steel tipped each.</p>

<p>Steel or wood, his muscles cried out for rest. His
legs wanted him to sit down, and his head wanted to lie down.
Keille and the gleeman were gone, but Aiel were still watching from
both camps. They had seen him practicing with a despised sword, if
a wooden one. They were his people. He did not know them, but they
were his, in more senses than one. Aviendha was still watching him,
too, glowering as though blaming him for Rhuarc having set her
down. Not that she had anything to do with his decision, of course.
The Jindo and Shaido were watching; that was it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That mountain can grow awfully heavy sometimes,&rdquo; he
sighed, taking a spear and buckler from Rhuarc. &ldquo;When do you find a
chance to put it down awhile?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you die,&rdquo; Lan said simply.</p>

<p>Forcing his legs to move&mdash;and trying to ignore
Aviendha&mdash;Rand squared off with Rhuarc. He did not mean to
die just yet. No, not for a long time yet.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Leaning against a tall wheel in the shade of one of
the peddlers&rsquo; wagons, Mat glanced at the line of Jindo watching
Rand. All he could see now was their backs. The man was a pure
fool, leaping about in this heat. Any sensible man would find a bit
of protection from the sun, something to drink. Shifting his seat
in the shade, he peered into the mug of ale he had bought from one
of the drivers and grimaced. Ale just did not taste right when it
was as warm as soup. At least it was wet. The only other thing he
had bought, aside from the hat, was a short-stemmed pipe with a
silver-worked bowl, snuggled now in his coat pocket with his tabac
pouch. Trading was not on his mind. Unless it was for passage out
of the Waste, a commodity the peddlers&rsquo; wagons did not seem to be
offering at the moment.</p>

<p>They were doing a steady business, if not for ale.
The Aiel did not mind the temperature, but they seemed to think it
too weak. Most were Jindo, but there was a steady stream of Shaido
from the other camp. Couladin and Kadere had their heads together
for a long time, though they came to no agreement, since Couladin
left empty-handed. Kadere must not have liked losing the trade; he
stared after Couladin with those hawk&rsquo;s eyes, and a Jindo who
wanted his attention had to speak three times before he was
heard.</p>

<p>The Aiel did not show much in the way of coin, but
the peddlers and their people were quick to accept silver bowls or
gold figurines or fine wall hangings looted from Tear, and Aiel
pouches produced raw nuggets of gold and silver that made Mat sit
up. But an Aiel who lost at dice might well reach for his spears.
He wondered where the mines were. Where one man could find gold,
another could. It was probably a lot of work, though, mining gold.
Taking a long drink of warm ale, he settled back against the wagon
wheel.</p>

<p>What sold and what did not, and at what price, was
interesting. The Aiel were no simple fools to hand over a gold
saltcellar, say, for a bolt of cloth. They knew the value of things
and bargained hard, though they had their own wants. Books went
immediately; not everyone wanted them, but those who did took every
last one the wagons held. Laces and velvets vanished as soon as
they were brought out, for astonishing quantities of silver and
gold, and ribbons for not much less, but the finest silks just lay
there. Silk was cheaper in trade to the east, he overheard a Shaido
tell Kadere. A heavy-set, broken-nosed driver tried to talk a Jindo
Maiden into a carved ivory bracelet. She pulled one wider, thicker
and more ornate from her pouch and offered to wrestle him for the
pair. He hesitated before refusing, which showed Mat he was even
dumber than he looked. Needles and pins were snapped up, but the
pots, and most of the knives, earned sneers; Aiel smiths did better
work. Everything changed hands, from vials of perfumes and bath
salts to kegs of brandy. Wine and brandy fetched good prices. He
was startled to hear Heirn ask for Two Rivers tabac. The peddlers
had none.</p>

<p>One driver kept trying to interest the Aiel in a
heavy, gold-worked crossbow with no success. The crossbow caught
Mat&rsquo;s eye, all those inlaid gold lions with what seemed to be
rubies for eyes. Small, but still rubies. Of course, a good Two
Rivers longbow could shoot six arrows while a crossbowman was still
cranking back the bowstring for his second shot. A longer range for
a crossbow that size, though, by a hundred paces. With two men
doing nothing but keeping a crossbow with bolt in place in the
hands of each crossbowman, and stout pikemen to hold the cavalry
off&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wincing, Mat let his head fall back against the
spokes. It had happened again. He had to get out of the Waste, away
from Moiraine, away from any Aes Sedai. Maybe back home for a
while. Maybe he could get there in time to help with this
Whitecloak trouble. <em>Small chance of that, unless I use the
bloody Ways, or another bloody Portal Stone</em>. That would not
solve his problems anyway. For one thing, there were no answers in
Emond&rsquo;s Field to what those snaky folk had meant about marrying the
Daughter of the Nine Moons, or dying and living again. Or
Rhuidean.</p>

<p>Through his coat he rubbed the silver foxhead
medallion, hung around his neck again. The pupil of the fox&rsquo;s eye
was a tiny circle split by a sinuous line, one side polished
bright, the other shaded in some way. The ancient symbol of Aes
Sedai, before the Breaking. The black-hafted spear, sword-blade
point marked with two ravens, he took from where it was leaning
beside him and laid it across his knees. More Aes Sedai work.
Rhuidean had provided no answers, only more questions, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before Rhuidean his memory had been full of holes.
Casting back in his mind then, he would be able to remember walking
up to a door in the morning and leaving in the evening, but nothing
between. Now there was something in between, filling all those
holes. Waking dreams, or something very like. It was as if he could
remember dances and battles and streets and cities, none of which
he had ever really seen, none of which he was sure had ever
existed, like a hundred pieces of memory from a hundred different
men. Better to think of them as dreams, maybe&mdash;a little
better&mdash;yet he was as sure in them as in any of his own
remembrances. Battles numbered the most, and sometimes they crept
up on him in a way, as with the crossbow. He would find himself
looking at a piece of ground and planning how to set an ambush
there, or defend against one, or how to set an army for battle. It
was madness.</p>

<p>Without looking, he traced the flowing script carved
into the black spear shaft. He could read it as easily as any book
now, though it had taken him the whole trip back to Chaendaer to
realize it. Rand had not said anything, but he suspected he had
given himself away, there in Rhuidean. He knew the Old Tongue now,
sifted whole out of those dreams. <em>Light, what did they do to
me?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Sa souvraya niende misain ye</em>,&rdquo; he said
aloud. &ldquo;I am lost in my own mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A scholar, for this day and Age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat looked up to find the gleeman looking at him with
dark, deep-set eyes. The fellow was taller than most, somewhere in
his middle years and likely attractive to women, but with an oddly
apprehensive way of holding his head cocked as if trying to look at
you sideways.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just something I heard once,&rdquo; Mat said. He had to be
more careful. If Moiraine decided to pack him off to the White
Tower for study, they would never let him out of there again. &ldquo;You
hear scraps of things and remember them. I know a few phrases.&rdquo;
That should cover any slips he was stupid enough to make.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Jasin Natael. A gleeman,&rdquo; Natael did not
flourish his cloak the way Thom would; he could have been saying he
was a carpenter or a wheelwright. &ldquo;Do you mind if I join you?&rdquo; Mat
nodded to the ground next to him, and the gleeman folded his legs,
tucking his cloak under to sit on. He seemed fascinated by the
Jindo and Shaido milling around the wagons, most still carrying
their spears and bucklers. &ldquo;Aiel,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Not what I would
have expected. I can still hardly credit it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been with them for weeks now,&rdquo; Mat said, &ldquo;and I
don&rsquo;t know that I believe them myself. Odd people. If any of the
Maidens ask you to play Maidens&rsquo; Kiss, my advice is to refuse.
Politely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Natael frowned at him questioningly. &ldquo;You lead an
intriguing life, it seems.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Mat asked cautiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely you do not think it is a secret? Not many men
travel in company with&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;an Aes Sedai. The woman Moiraine
Damodred. And then there is Rand al&rsquo;Thor. The Dragon Reborn. He Who
Comes With the Dawn. Who can say how many prophecies he is supposed
to fulfill? An unusual traveling companion, certainly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aiel had talked, of course. Anyone would. Still,
it was a little unsettling to have a stranger calmly talk about
Rand this way. &ldquo;He suits well enough for now. If he interests you,
talk to him. Myself, I&rsquo;d just as soon not be reminded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I will. Later, perhaps. Let us talk of you.
I understand you went into Rhuidean, where none save Aiel have gone
in three thousand years. You got that there?&rdquo; He reached for the
spear on Mat&rsquo;s knees, but let his hand fall when Mat drew it away
slightly. &ldquo;Very well. Tell me what you saw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a gleeman, Matrim.&rdquo; Natael had his head cocked
to one side in that uneasy manner, but his voice held irritation at
having to explain. He lifted a corner of his cloak with its
colorful patches as though for proof. &ldquo;You have seen what none
have, save a handful of Aiel. What stories can I make with the
sights your eyes have seen? I will even make you the hero, if you
wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat snorted. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be any bloody
hero.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet there was no reason to keep silent. Amys and that
lot could chatter about not speaking of Rhuidean, but he was no
Aiel. Besides, it might pay to have somebody with the peddlers who
had a little goodwill toward him, somebody who could put in a word
when it was needed.</p>

<p>He told the story from reaching the wall of fog to
coming out, leaving out selected bits. He had no intention of
telling anyone else about that twisted-doorway <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, and he would rather forget the dust gathering
into creatures that tried to kill him. That strange city of huge
palaces was surely enough, and <em>Avendesora</em>.</p>

<p>The Tree of Life Natael passed over quickly, but he
took Mat through the rest again and again, asking more and more
detail, from exactly what it felt like walking through that fog and
how long it took to the color of the shadowless light inside, to
descriptions of every last thing Mat could remember seeing in the
great square in the heart of the city. Those Mat gave reluctantly;
a slip, and he would find himself talking about <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, and who knew where that might lead? Even so he
drained the last of the warm ale, and still talked until his throat
was dry. It sounded rather dull the way he told it, as though he
had just walked in and waited while Rand went off, then walked out
again, but Natael seemed intent on digging out every last scrap. He
did remind Mat of Thom then; sometimes Thom concentrated on you as
though he meant to wring you dry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this what you are meant to be doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat jumped in spite of himself at the sound of
Keille&rsquo;s voice, hard under its mellifluous tones. The woman put him
on edge, and now she looked ready to rip his heart out, and the
gleeman&rsquo;s as well.</p>

<p>Natael scrambled to his feet. &ldquo;This young man has
just been telling me the most fascinating things about Rhuidean.
You will not believe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are not here for Rhuidean.&rdquo; The words came out as
sharp as her hatchet of a nose. At least she was only glaring at
Natael now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You tell me nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not try to silence me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ignoring Mat, they moved off down the wagons, arguing
in low voices, gesticulating fiercely. Keille seemed to have been
browbeaten into a grim silence by the time they disappeared into
her wagon.</p>

<p>Mat shivered. He could not imagine sharing living
quarters with that woman. It would be like sharing with a bear with
a sore tooth. Isendre, now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;That face, those lips, that
swaying walk. If he could get her away from Kadere, maybe she would
find a young hero&mdash;the dust creatures could be ten feet tall,
for her; he would give her every detail he could remember or invent&mdash;a handsome young hero more to her liking than a stuffy old
peddler. It was worth thinking about.</p>

<p>The sun slid below the horizon, and small fires of
thorny branches made pools of yellow light among the tents. The
smells of cooking filled the camp; goat, roasting with dried
peppers. Cold filled the camp, too, the cold of night in the Waste.
It was as if the sun had taken all the heat with it. Mat had never
expected he would wish for a stout cloak when he packed to leave
the Stone. Maybe the peddlers had one. Maybe Natael would dice for
his.</p>

<p>He ate at Rhuarc&rsquo;s fire with Heirn and Rand. And
Aviendha, of course. The peddlers were there, and Natael close by
Keille, and Isendre all but wrapped around Kadere. It might be
harder separating Isendre from the hook-nosed man than he had hoped&mdash;or easier. Twined around the fellow or not, she had smoky
eyes for Rand and no one else. You would have thought she already
had his ears clipped, a sheep marked for its owner&rsquo;s flock. Neither
Rand nor Kadere seemed to notice; the peddler hardly took his eyes
off Rand. Aviendha noticed, and glared at Rand. At least the fire
gave off some warmth.</p>

<p>When the roast goat was finished&mdash;and some sort
of flecked yellow mush that was spicier than it looked&mdash;Rhuarc and Heirn filled short-stemmed pipes, and the clan chief
asked Natael for a song.</p>

<p>The gleeman blinked. &ldquo;Why, of course. Of course. Let
me bring a harp.&rdquo; His cloak billowed on the dry, cold breeze as he
vanished toward Keille&rsquo;s wagon.</p>

<p>The fellow certainly was different from Thom
Merrilin. Thom hardly got out of bed without flute or harp or both.
Mat thumbed his silver-worked pipe full of tabac, and was puffing
contentedly by the time Natael returned and struck a pose suitable
for a king. That was like Thom. With a strummed cord, the gleeman
began.</p>

<p class="verse_quote">&ldquo;Soft, the winds, like springtime&rsquo;s fingers.<br>
 Soft, the rains, like heaven&rsquo;s tears.<br>
 Soft, the years roll by in gladness,<br>
 never hinting storms to come,<br>
 never hinting whirlwinds&rsquo; ravage,<br>
 rain of steel and battle thunder,<br>
 war to tear the heart asunder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was &ldquo;Midean&rsquo;s Ford.&rdquo; An old song; of Manetheren,
oddly enough, and war before the Trolloc Wars. Natael did a fair
job of it; nothing like Thom&rsquo;s sonorous recitals, of course, but
the rolling words drew a crowd of Aiel thick around the edge of the
fire&rsquo;s light. Villainous Aedomon led the Saferi down on
unsuspecting Manetheren, pillaging and burning, driving all before
them until King Buiryn gathered Manetheren&rsquo;s strength, and the men
of Manetheren met the Saferi at Midean&rsquo;s Ford, holding, though
heavily outnumbered, through three days of unrelenting battle,
while the river ran red and vultures blacked the sky. On the third
day, numbers dwindling, hope fading, Buiryn and his men fought
their way across the ford in a desperate sortie, driving deep into
Aedomon&rsquo;s horde, seeking to turn the enemy back by killing Aedomon
himself. But forces too great to overpower swept in around them,
trapping them, driving them ever in on themselves. Surrounding
their king and the Red Eagle banner, they fought on, refusing
surrender even when their doom became clear.</p>

<p>Natael sang how their courage touched even Aedomon&rsquo;s
heart, and how at last he allowed the remnant to go free, turning
his army back to Safer in honor of them.</p>

<p class="verse_quote">&ldquo;Back across the blood-red water,<br>
 marching back with heads held high.<br>
 No surrender, arm or sword,<br>
 no surrender, heart or soul.<br>
 Honor be theirs, ever after,<br>
 honor all the Age shall know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He plucked the final chord, and the Aiel whistled
their approval, drumming spears on their hide bucklers, some
raising ululating cries.</p>

<p>It had not been that way, of course. Mat could
remember&mdash;<em>Light, I don&rsquo;t want</em> to! But it came anyway&mdash;he remembered counseling Buiryn not to accept the offer,
being told in return that the smallest chance was better than none.
Aedomon, glossy black beard hanging below the steel mesh that
veiled his face, drew his spearmen back, waited until they were
strung out and nearly to the ford before the hidden archers rose
and the cavalry charged in. As for turning back to Safer&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Mat
did not think so. His last memory at the ford was trying to keep
his feet, waist-deep in the river with three arrows in him, but
there was something later, a fragment. Seeing Aedomon, gray-bearded
now, go down in a sharp fight in a forest, toppling from his
rearing horse, the spear in his back put there by an unarmored,
beardless boy. This was worse than the holes had been.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not like the song?&rdquo; Natael said.</p>

<p>It took Mat a moment to realize the man was speaking
to Rand, not him. Rand rubbed his hands together, peering into the
small fire, before answering. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not certain how wise it is,
depending on an enemy&rsquo;s generosity. What do you think, Kadere?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The peddler hesitated, glancing at the woman clinging
to his arm. &ldquo;I do not think of such things,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;I
think of profits, not battles.&rdquo; Keille laughed coarsely. At least,
until she saw Isendre&rsquo;s smile, condescending to a woman who could
make three of her; then her dark eyes glittered dangerously behind
those rolls of fat.</p>

<p>Suddenly warning cries rose in the dark beyond the
tents. Aiel snatched veils across their faces, and a moment later
Trollocs poured in out of the night, snouted faces and horned
heads, towering over the humans, howling and swinging scythe-curved
swords, stabbing with hooked spears and barbed tridents, hacking
with spiked axes. Myrddraal flowed with them, like deadly eyeless
snakes. A heartbeat it took, but the Aiel fought as if they had had
an hour&rsquo;s warning, meeting the charge with their own flickering
spears.</p>

<p>Mat was vaguely aware of Rand with that fiery sword
suddenly in hand, but then he was sucked into the maelstrom
himself, wielding his spear as spear and quarterstaff both, slash
and thrust, haft whirling. For once he was glad of those dream
memories; the way of this weapon seemed familiar, and he needed
every scrap of skill he could find. It was all chaotic madness.</p>

<p>Trollocs rose up in front of him and went down to his
spear, or an Aiel spear, or spun away into the confusion of shouts
and howls and clanging steel. Myrddraal faced him, black blades
meeting his raven-marked steel with flashes of blue light like
sheet lightning, faced him and were gone in the tumult. Twice a
short spear streaking by his head took Trollocs about to run him
through the back. He thrust the short-sword blade into a
Myrddraal&rsquo;s chest and knew he was going to die when it did not
fall, but grinned with those bloodless lips, eyeless stare
shivering fear into his bones, and drew back its black sword. An
instant later the Halfman jerked as Aiel arrows pincushioned it,
jerked for the moment Mat needed to leap back from the thing as it
fell still trying to stab at him, stab at anything.</p>

<p>A dozen times the spear&rsquo;s iron-hard black haft barely
deflected a Trolloc thrust. It was Aes Sedai work, and he was glad
of it. The silver foxhead on his chest seemed to pulse with cold as
if to remind him that it, too, bore the mark of Aes Sedai. Right
then, he did not care; if it took Aes Sedai work to keep him alive,
he was ready to follow Moiraine like a puppy.</p>

<p>He could not have said if it went on for minutes or
hours, but suddenly there was not a Myrddraal or Trolloc still
standing in sight, though cries and howls from the darkness spoke
of pursuit. Dead and dying littered the ground, Aiel and
Shadowspawn, the Halfmen still thrashing. Groans filled the air
with pain. Suddenly he realized his muscles felt like water, and
his lungs were afire. Panting, he slid down to his knees, leaning
on his spear. Flames made bonfires of three of the peddlers&rsquo;
canvas-topped wagons, one with a driver pinned to the side by a
Trolloc spear, and some of the tents were burning. Shouts from the
direction of the Shaido camp, and glows too large for campfires,
said they had been attacked, too.</p>

<p>Fiery sword still in hand, Rand came to where Mat
knelt. &ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; Aviendha shadowed him. Somewhere she
had found a spear and buckler, had tucked up a corner of her shawl
to veil her face. Even in skirts she looked deadly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am fine,&rdquo; Mat muttered, struggling to his
feet. &ldquo;Nothing like a little dance with Trollocs to ready you for
sleep. Right, Aviendha?&rdquo; Uncovering her face, she gave him a tight
smile. The woman had probably <em>enjoyed</em> it. He was sweat all
over; he thought it might freeze on him.</p>

<p>Moiraine and Egwene had appeared with two of the Wise
Ones, Amys and Bair, circulating among the wounded. The convulsion
of Healing followed the Aes Sedai, though sometimes she merely
shook her head and moved on.</p>

<p>Rhuarc strode up with a grim face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bad news?&rdquo; Rand said quietly.</p>

<p>The clan chief grunted. &ldquo;Aside from Trollocs here
where they should not be, not by two hundred leagues or more?
Perhaps. Some fifty Trollocs attacked the Wise Ones&rsquo; camp. Enough
to overwhelm it, had it not been for Moiraine Sedai and luck.
However, it seems the Shaido were hit by fewer than struck us,
though since they are the larger camp the reverse should have been
true. I might almost think they were attacked only to keep them
from coming to our aid. Not that that would be certain, with
Shaido, but Trollocs and Nightrunners might not know that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if they knew an Aes Sedai was with the Wise
Ones,&rdquo; Rand said, &ldquo;that attack could have been meant to keep her
away, too. I bring enemies with me, Rhuarc. Remember that. Wherever
I am, my enemies are never far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Isendre poked her head out of the lead wagon. A
moment later Kadere climbed down past her, and she ducked back
inside, shutting the white-painted door behind him. He stood
looking around at the carnage, the light of his burning wagons
painting rippling shadows across his face. The group around Mat
held his attention most. The wagons seemed to interest him not at
all. Natael got down from Keille&rsquo;s wagon, too, speaking up the
stairs to her still inside, his eyes on Mat and the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fools,&rdquo; Mat muttered, half to himself. &ldquo;Hiding
inside the wagons, as if that would make any difference to a
Trolloc. They could all have roasted alive, easy as not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are still alive,&rdquo; Rand said, and Mat realized
he had seen them, too. &ldquo;That is always important, Mat, who stays
alive. It&rsquo;s like dice. You can&rsquo;t win if you can&rsquo;t play, and you
can&rsquo;t play if you are dead. Who can say what game the peddlers
play?&rdquo; He laughed quietly, and the fiery sword vanished from his
hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to get some sleep,&rdquo; Mat said, already
turning away. &ldquo;Wake me if the Trollocs show up again. Or better,
let them kill me in my blankets. I am too tired to wake up again.&rdquo;
Rand was definitely going over the edge. Maybe tonight would
convince Keille and Kadere to turn back. If they did, he intended
to be with them.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Rand let Moiraine look at him, muttering to herself,
though he had taken no wound. With so many who had, she could not
spare the strength to wash away his fatigue with the One Power.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This was aimed at you,&rdquo; she told him, surrounded by
the moans of the injured. The Trollocs were being dragged away into
the night, by packhorses and the peddlers&rsquo; mules. The Aiel
apparently intended to leave the Myrddraal where they lay until
they stopped moving, to make sure they were really dead. The wind
gusted up, like ice with no moisture in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it?&rdquo; he said. Her eyes glittered in the
firelight before she turned back to the wounded.</p>

<p>Egwene came to him, too, but only to say in a low,
fierce whisper, &ldquo;Whatever you are doing to upset her, stop it!&rdquo; The
glance she shot past him at Aviendha left no doubt who she meant,
and she went off to help Bair and Amys before he could say he had
done nothing. She looked ridiculous with those two braids twined
with ribbons. The Aiel seemed to think so, too; some of them
grinned at her back.</p>

<p>Stumbling, shivering, he sought his tent. He had
never been this tired before. The sword had almost not come. He
hoped that was the tiredness. Sometimes there was nothing there
when he reached for the Source, and sometimes the Power would not
do what he wanted, but almost from the first the sword had come
practically without thought. Now of all times&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;It had to be the
tiredness.</p>

<p>Aviendha insisted on following him as far as the
tent, and when he woke the next morning she was sitting outside
cross-legged, though without the spear and buckler. Spy or not, he
was glad to see her. At least he knew who and what she was, and
what she felt for him.</p>
