<h4><em>Customs of Mayene</em></h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">P</span>errin
shook his head as the door closed behind Mat.
Mat would as soon hit himself on the head with a hammer as go back
to the Two Rivers. Not unless he must. Perrin wished there was some
way he could avoid going home, too. But there was no way; it was a
fact as hard as iron and less forgiving. The difference between Mat
and himself was that he was willing to accept that, even when he
did not want to.</p>

<p>Easing his shirt off made him grunt, careful as he
could be. A large bruise, already faded to browns and yellows,
stained his entire left shoulder. A Trolloc had slipped past his
axe, and only Faile&rsquo;s quick work with a knife had kept it from
being more than it was. The shoulder made washing painful, but at
least there was no worry about cold water in Tear.</p>

<p>He was packed and ready, only a change of clothes for
the morning remaining out of his saddlebags. As soon as the sun
rose, he would go find Loial. No point in bothering the Ogier
tonight. He was probably already abed, where Perrin meant to be
shortly. Faile was the only problem he had not figured out how to
deal with. Even staying in Tear would be better for her than going
with him.</p>

<p>The door opened, surprising him. Perfume wafted in to
him as soon as the door cracked; it made him think of climbing
flowers on a hot summer night. A tantalizing scent, not heavy, not
to anyone but him, but nothing Faile would wear. Still, he was even
more surprised when Berelain stepped into his room.</p>

<p>Holding the edge of the door, she blinked, making him
realize how dim the light must be for her. &ldquo;You are going
somewhere?&rdquo; she said hesitantly, With the light of the hallway&rsquo;s
lamps behind her, it was difficult not to stare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my Lady.&rdquo; He bowed; not smoothly, but as well
as he could. Faile could give all the sharp sniffs she wanted, but
he saw no reason not to be polite. &ldquo;In the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I.&rdquo; She closed the door and crossed her arms
beneath her breasts. He looked away, watching her from the corner
of his eye, so she would not think he was goggling. She went on
without noticing his reaction. The single candle flame was
reflected in her dark eyes. &ldquo;After tonight&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Tomorrow I will
leave by carriage for Godan, and from there take ship for Mayene. I
should have gone days ago, but I thought there must be some way to
work matters out. Only, there wasn&rsquo;t, of course. I should have seen
that sooner. Tonight convinced me. The way he&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;All that
lightning, flowing down the halls. I will leave tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lady,&rdquo; Perrin said in confusion, &ldquo;why are you
telling me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The way she tossed her head reminded him of a mare he
had sometimes shoed in Emond&rsquo;s Field; that mare would try to take a
bite out of you. &ldquo;So you can tell the Lord Dragon, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That made no more sense to him. &ldquo;You can tell him
yourself,&rdquo; he said with more than a little exasperation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no
time for carrying messages before I go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;do not think he would wish to see me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Any man would want to see her, and she was beautiful
to look at; she knew both things. He thought she had started to say
something else. Could she have been that frightened by what had
happened that night in Rand&rsquo;s bedchamber? Or the attack and the way
Rand had ended it? Perhaps, but this was not a woman to frighten
easily, not from the cool way she was eyeing him. &ldquo;Give your
message to a servant. I doubt I&rsquo;ll see Rand again. Not before I
leave. Any servant will take a note to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would come better from you, a friend of the Lord&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give it to a servant. Or one of the Aiel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will not do as I ask?&rdquo; she asked
incredulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Haven&rsquo;t you been listening to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She tossed her head again, but there was a difference
this time, though he could not have said what. Studying him
thoughtfully, she murmured half to herself, &ldquo;Such striking
eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Suddenly he realized he was standing there
naked to the waist. Her intense scrutiny abruptly seemed like the
study of a horse before purchase. Next thing, she would be feeling
his ankles and inspecting his teeth. He snatched the shirt meant
for morning from the bed and pulled it over his head. &ldquo;Give your
message to a servant. I want to go to bed now. I mean to be up
early. Before sunrise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you going tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Home. The Two Rivers. It is late. If you are leaving
tomorrow, too, I suppose you want to get some sleep. I know I&rsquo;m
tired.&rdquo; He yawned as widely as he could.</p>

<p>She still made no move toward the door. &ldquo;You are a
blacksmith? I have need of a blacksmith in Mayene. Making
ornamental ironwork. A short stay before returning to the Two
Rivers? You would find Mayene&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;entertaining.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going home,&rdquo; he told her firmly, &ldquo;and you are
going back to your own rooms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her small shrug made him look away again hastily.
&ldquo;Perhaps another day. I always get what I want in the end. And I
think I want&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She paused, eyeing him up and down. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ornamental ironwork. For the windows of my bedchamber.&rdquo; She smiled
so innocently that he felt alarm gongs sounding his head.</p>

<p>The door opened again, and Faile came in. &ldquo;Perrin, I
went into the city looking for you, and I heard a rumor&mdash;&rdquo; She
stopped stock still, her eyes hard on Berelain.</p>

<p>The First ignored her. Stepping close to Perrin, she
ran a hand up his arm, across his shoulder. For an instant he
thought she meant to try pulling his head down for a kiss&mdash;she certainly lifted her face as if for one&mdash;but she only
trailed her hand along the side of his neck in a quick caress and
stepped back. It was over and done before he could move to stop
her. &ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; she said softly, as if they were alone, &ldquo;I always
get what I want.&rdquo; And she swept past Faile and out of the room.</p>

<p>He waited for an explosion from Faile, but she
glanced at his stuffed saddlebags on the bed and said, &ldquo;I see
you&rsquo;ve heard the rumor already. It <em>is</em> only a rumor,
Perrin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yellow eyes make it more than that.&rdquo; She should have
been erupting like a bundle of dry twigs tossed on a fire. Why was
she so cool?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well. Moiraine is the next problem, then. Will
she try to stop you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not if she doesn&rsquo;t know. If she tries, I will go
anyway. I have family and friends, Faile; I won&rsquo;t leave them to
Whitecloaks. But I hope to keep it from her until I am well out of
the city.&rdquo; Even her eyes were calm, like dark pools in the forest.
It made his hackles rise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it had to take weeks for that rumor to reach
Tear, and it will take weeks more to ride to the Two Rivers. The
Whitecloaks could be gone by then. Well, I have been wanting you to
leave here. I should not complain. I just want you to know what to
expect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take weeks by the Ways,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;Two
days, maybe three.&rdquo; Two days. He supposed there was no means to
make it faster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are as mad as Rand al&rsquo;Thor,&rdquo; she said
disbelievingly. Dropping on the foot of his bed, she folded her
legs crosswise and addressed him in a voice suitable for lecturing
children. &ldquo;Go into the Ways, and you come out hopelessly mad. If
you come out at all, which it is most likely you will not. The Ways
are tainted, Perrin. They have been dark for&mdash;what?&mdash;three hundred years? Four hundred? Ask Loial. He could tell you. It
was Ogiers built the Ways, or grew them, or whatever it was. Not
even they use the Ways. Why, even if you managed to make it through
them unscathed, the Light alone knows where you would come
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have traveled them, Faile.&rdquo; And a frightening trip
it had been, too. &ldquo;Loial can guide me. He can read the guideposts;
that&rsquo;s how we went before. He will do it for me again when he knows
how important it is.&rdquo; Loial was eager to be away from Tear, too; he
seemed to be afraid that his mother knew where he was. Perrin was
sure he would help.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, rubbing her hands together briskly.
&ldquo;Well, I wanted adventure, and this is certainly it. Leaving the
Stone of Tear and the Dragon Reborn, traveling the Ways to fight
Whitecloaks. I wonder whether we can persuade Thom Merrilin to come
along. If we cannot have a bard, a gleeman will do. He could
compose the story, and you and I the heart of it. No Dragon Reborn
or Aes Sedai about to swallow up the tale. When do we leave? In the
morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took a deep breath to steady his voice. &ldquo;I will be
going alone, Faile. Just Loial and me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will need a packhorse,&rdquo; she said as if he had not
spoken. &ldquo;Two, I think. The Ways are dark. We will need lanterns,
and plenty of oil. Your Two Rivers people. Farmers? Will they fight
Whitecloaks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faile, I said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard what you said,&rdquo; she snapped. Shadows gave
her a dangerous look, with her tilted eyes and high cheekbones. &ldquo;I
heard, and it makes no sense. What if these farmers won&rsquo;t fight? Or
don&rsquo;t know how? Who is going to teach them? You? Alone?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do what has to be done,&rdquo; he said patiently.
&ldquo;Without you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She bounced to her feet so fast he thought she was
coming for his throat. &ldquo;Do you think Berelain will go with you?
Will she guard your back? Or perhaps you prefer her to sit on your
lap and squeal? Tuck your shirt in, you hairy oaf! Does it have to
be so dark in here? Berelain likes dim light, does she? Much good
she will do you against the Children of the Light!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin opened his mouth to protest, and changed what
he had been going to say. &ldquo;She looks a pleasant armful, Berelain.
What man wouldn&rsquo;t want her on his lap?&rdquo; The hurt on her face banded
his chest with iron, but he made himself go on. &ldquo;When I am done at
home, I may go to Mayene. She asked me to come, and I might.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faile said not a word. She stared at him with a face
like stone, then whirled and ran out, slamming the door behind her
with a crash.</p>

<p>In spite of himself he started to follow, then
stopped with his hands gripping the doorframe till his fingers
hurt. Staring at the splintered gash his axe had made in the door,
he found himself telling it what he could not tell her. &ldquo;I killed
Whitecloaks. They would have killed me if I hadn&rsquo;t, but they still
call it murder. I&rsquo;m going home to die, Faile. That&rsquo;s the only way I
can stop them hurting my people. Let them hang me. I cannot let you
see that. I can&rsquo;t. You might even try to stop it, and then they&rsquo;d&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>His head dropped against the door. She would not be
sorry to see the last of him now; that was what was important. She
would go find her adventure somewhere else, safe from
Whitecloaks and <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> and bubbles of
evil. That was all that was important. He wished he did not want to
howl with grief.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Faile strode through the halls at a near run,
oblivious of who she passed or who had to scramble out of her way.
Perrin. Berelain. Perrin. Berelain. <em>He wants a milk-faced vixen
who runs about half-naked, does he? He doesn&rsquo;t know what he wants.
Hairy lummox! Wooden-headed buffoon! Blacksmith! And that sneaking
sow, Berelain. That prancing she-goat!</em></p>

<p>She did not realize where she was going until she saw
Berelain ahead of her, gliding along in that dress that left
nothing to the imagination, swaying along as if that walk of hers
was not deliberately calculated to make male eyes pop. Before Faile
knew what she was doing, she had darted ahead of Berelain and
turned to face her where two corridors met.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perrin Aybara belongs to me,&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;You keep
your hands and your smiles away from him!&rdquo; She flushed to her
hairline when she heard what she had said. She had promised herself
she would never do this, never fight over a man like a farmgirl
rolling in the dirt at harvest.</p>

<p>Berelain arched a cool eyebrow. &ldquo;Belongs to you?
Strange, I saw no collar on him. You serving girls&mdash;or are
you a farmer&rsquo;s daughter?&mdash;you have the most peculiar
ideas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Serving girl? Serving girl! I am&mdash;&rdquo; Faile bit
her tongue to stop the furious words. The First of Mayene, indeed.
There were estates in Saldaea larger than Mayene. She would not
last a week in the courts of Saldaea. Could she recite poetry while
hawking? Could she ride in the hunt all day, then play the cittern
at night while discussing how to counter Trolloc raids? She thought
she knew men, did she? Did she know the language of fans? Could she
tell a man to come or go or stay, and a hundred things more, all
with the twist of a wrist and the placement of a lace fan? <em>
Light shine on me, what am I thinking? I swore I would never even
hold a fan again!</em> But there were other Saldaean customs. She
was surprised to see the knife in her hand; she had been taught not
to draw a knife unless she meant to use it. &ldquo;Farm girls in Saldaea
have a way of dealing with women who poach others&rsquo; men. If you do
not swear to forget Perrin Aybara, I will shave your head as bald
as an egg. Perhaps the boys who tend the chickens will pant after
you, then!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was not sure exactly how Berelain gripped her
wrist, but suddenly she was flying through the air. The floor
crashing into her back drove all the air from her lungs.</p>

<p>Berelain stood smiling, tapping the blade of Faile&rsquo;s
knife on her palm. &ldquo;A custom of Mayene. The Tairens do like to use
assassins, and the guards cannot always be close at hand. I despise
being attacked, farmgirl, so this is what I will do. I will take
the blacksmith away from you and keep him as a pet for as long as
he amuses me. Ogier&rsquo;s oath on it, farmgirl. He is quite ravishing,
really&mdash;those shoulders, those arms; not to mention those
eyes of his&mdash;and if he is a bit uncultured, I can have that
remedied. My courtiers can teach him how to dress, and rid him of
that awful beard. Wherever he goes, I will find him and make him
mine. You can have him when I am finished. If he still wants you,
of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Finally managing to draw a breath, Faile struggled to
her feet, pulling a second knife. &ldquo;I will drag you to him, after I
cut off those clothes you are almost wearing, and make you tell him
you are nothing but a sow!&rdquo; <em>Light help me, I</em> am <em>
behaving like a farmgirl, and talking like one!</em> The worst part
was that she meant it.</p>

<p>Berelain set herself warily. She meant to use her
hands, obviously, not the knife. She held it like a fan. Faile
advanced on the balls of her feet.</p>

<p>Suddenly Rhuarc was there between them, towering over
them, snatching the knives away before either woman was really
aware of him. &ldquo;Have you not seen enough blood already tonight?&rdquo; he
said coldly. &ldquo;Of all those I thought I might find breaking the
peace, the two of you would be the last named.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faile gaped at him. With no warning, she pivoted,
driving her fist toward Rhuarc&rsquo;s short ribs. The toughest man would
feel it there.</p>

<p>He seemed to move without looking at her, caught her
hand, forced her arm straight to her side, twisted. Abruptly she
was standing very straight and hoping he did not push her arm right
up out of her shoulder.</p>

<p>As if nothing had happened, he addressed Berelain.
&ldquo;You will go to your room, and you will not come out until the sun
is above the horizon. I will see that no breakfast is brought to
you. A little hunger will remind you that there is a time and place
for fighting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Berelain drew herself up indignantly. &ldquo;I am the First
of Mayene. I will not be ordered about like&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will go to your rooms. Now,&rdquo; Rhuarc told her
flatly. Faile wondered if she could kick him; she must have tensed,
because as soon as she thought of it, he increased the pressure on
her wrist, and she was up on her tiptoes. &ldquo;If you do not,&rdquo; he went
on to Berelain, &ldquo;we will repeat our first talk together, you and I.
Right here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Berelain&rsquo;s face went white and red by turns. &ldquo;Very
well,&rdquo; she said stiffly. &ldquo;If you insist, I will perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not propose a discussion. If I can still see
you when I have counted three&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;One.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a gasp, Berelain hiked her skirts and ran. She
even managed to sway doing that.</p>

<p>Faile stared after her in amazement. It was almost
worth having her arm nearly disjointed. Rhuarc was watching
Berelain go, too, a small appreciative smile on his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to hold me all night?&rdquo; she demanded. He
released her&mdash;and tucked her knives into his belt. &ldquo;Those are
mine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forfeit,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Berelain&rsquo;s punishment for
fighting was to have you see her sent to bed like a willful child.
Yours is to lose these knives you prize. I know you have others. If
you argue, I might take those, too. I will not have the peace
broken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She glared at him, but she suspected he meant just
what he said. Those knives had been made for her by a man who knew
what he was doing; the balance was just right. &ldquo;What &lsquo;first
talk&rsquo; did you have with her? Why did she run like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is between her and me. You will not go near her
again, Faile. I do not believe she started this; that one&rsquo;s weapons
are not knives. If either of you makes trouble again, I will put
both of you to carrying offal. Some of the Tairens thought they
could keep on fighting their duels after I had declared peace on
this place, but the smell of the refuse carts soon taught them
their mistake. Be sure you do not have to learn it the same
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She waited until he had gone before nursing her
shoulder. He reminded her of her father. Not that her father had
ever twisted her arm, but he had small patience with those who made
trouble, whatever their position, and no one ever caught him by
surprise. She wondered if she could bait Berelain into something,
just to see the First of Mayene sweating among the refuse carts.
But Rhuarc had said both of them. Her father meant what he said,
too. Berelain. Something Berelain had said was tickling the back of
her mind. Ogier&rsquo;s oath. That was it. An Ogier never broke an oath.
To say &ldquo;Ogier oathbreaker&rdquo; was like saying &ldquo;brave coward,&rdquo; or &ldquo;wise
fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She could not help laughing aloud. &ldquo;You will take him
from me, you silly peahen? By the time you see him again, if you
ever do, he&rsquo;ll be mine once more.&rdquo; Chuckling to herself, and
occasionally rubbing her shoulder, she walked on with a light
heart.</p>
