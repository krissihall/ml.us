<h4><em>Rhuidean</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
smooth pebble in Mat&rsquo;s mouth was not making
moisture anymore, and had not been for some time. Spitting it out,
he squatted beside Rand and stared at the billowing gray wall maybe
thirty paces in front of them. Fog. He hoped at least it was cooler
in there than out here. And some water would be appreciated. His
lips were cracking. He pulled the scarf from around his head and
wiped his face, but there was not much sweat to dampen the cloth.
Not much sweat remained in him to come out. A place to sit down.
His feet felt like cooked sausages inside his boots; he felt pretty
well cooked all over, for that matter. The fog stretched left and
right better than a mile and bulked over his head like a towering
cliff. A cliff of thick mist in the middle of a barren blistered
valley. There had to be water in there.</p>

<p><em>Why doesn&rsquo;t it burn off?</em> He did not like
that part of it. Fooling with the Power had brought him here, and
now it seemed he had to fool with it again. <em>Light, I want free
of the Power and Aes Sedai. Burn me, I do!</em> Anything not to
think of stepping into that fog, for just a minute more. &ldquo;That <em>
was</em> Egwene&rsquo;s Aiel friend I saw running,&rdquo; he croaked. Running!
In this heat. Just thinking of it made his feet hurt worse.
&ldquo;Aviendha. Whatever her name is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you say so,&rdquo; Rand said, studying the fog. He
sounded as if he had a mouthful of dust, his face was sunburned,
and he wavered unsteadily in his crouch. &ldquo;But what would she be
doing down here? And <em>naked</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat let it go. Rand had not seen her&mdash;he had
hardly taken his eyes off the roiling mist since starting down the
mountain&mdash;and he did not believe Mat had seen her either.
Running like a madwoman and keeping wide of the two of them.
Heading for this strange fog, it had seemed to him. Rand appeared
no more eager to step into that than he was. He wondered whether he
looked as bad as Rand did. Touching his cheek, he winced. He
expected he did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we going to stay out here all night? This valley
is pretty deep. It&rsquo;ll be dark down here in another couple of hours.
Might be cooler then, but I don&rsquo;t think I would like to meet
whatever runs around this place in the night. Lions, probably. I&rsquo;ve
heard there are lions in the Waste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you want to do this, Mat? You heard
what the Wise Ones said. You can die in there, or go mad. You can
make it back to the tents. You left water bottles and a waterbag on
Pips&rsquo;s saddle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He wished Rand had not reminded him. Best not to
think about water. &ldquo;Burn me, no, I don&rsquo;t want to. I <em>have</em>
to. What about you? Isn&rsquo;t being the bloody Dragon Reborn enough for
you? Do you have to be a flaming Aiel clan chief, too? Why are you
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to be, Mat. I have to be.&rdquo; Resignation came
through the parch in his voice, but something else, too. A hint of
eagerness. The man really was mad; he <em>wanted</em> to do
this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand, maybe that&rsquo;s the answer they give everybody.
Those snake people, I mean. Go to Rhuidean. Maybe we don&rsquo;t have to
be here at all.&rdquo; He did not believe it, but with that fog staring
him in the face&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rand turned his head to look at him, not speaking.
Finally he said, &ldquo;They never mentioned Rhuidean to me, Mat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, burn me,&rdquo; he muttered. Somehow or other he meant
to find a way back through that twisted doorway in Tear. Absently
he pulled the gold Tar Valon mark from his coat pocket, rolled it
across the backs of his fingers and thrust it back. Those snaky
folk were going to give him a few more answers whether they wanted
to or not. Somehow.</p>

<p>Without another word, Rand rose and started toward
the fog in an unsteady stride, his eyes fixed straight ahead. Mat
hurried after him. <em>Burn me. Burn me. I do</em> not <em>want to
do this</em>.</p>

<p>Rand plunged right into the dense mist, but Mat
hesitated a moment before following. It had to be the Power
maintaining the fog, after all, with its edge boiling so but never
advancing or retreating an inch. The bloody Power, and no bloody
choice. That first step was a blessed relief, cool and damp; he
opened his mouth to let the mist moisten his tongue. Three steps
more and he began to worry. Beyond the tip of his nose was only
featureless gray. He could not make out even a shadow that could be
Rand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand?&rdquo; The sound might as well not have come from
his mouth; the murk seemed to swallow it before it reached his own
ears. He was not even sure of his direction anymore, and he could
always remember his way. Anything might be ahead of him. Or under
his feet. He could not see his feet; the fog shrouded him
completely below the waist. He picked up his pace regardless. And
suddenly stepped out beside Rand into a peculiar shadowless
light.</p>

<p>The fog made an enormous hollow dome hiding the sky,
its bubbling inner surface glowing in a pale sharp blue. Rhuidean
was not nearly so big as Tear or Caemlyn, but the empty streets
were broad as any he had ever seen, with wide strips of bare dirt
down their centers as if trees had grown there once, and great
fountains with statues. Huge buildings flanked the streets, odd
flat-sided palaces of marble and crystal and cut glass, ascending
hundreds of feet in steps or sheer walls. There was not a small
building to be seen, nothing that might have been a simple tavern
or an inn or a stable. Only immense palaces, with gleaming columns
fifty feet thick climbing a hundred paces in red or white or blue,
and grand towers, fluted and spiraled, some piercing the glowing
clouds above.</p>

<p>For all its grandeur, the city had never been
finished. Many of those tremendous structures ended in the sawteeth
of abandoned construction. Colored glass made images in some huge
windows: serenely majestic men and women thirty feet tall or more,
sunrises and starry night skies; others gaped emptily. Unfinished
and long deserted. No water splashed in any fountain. Silence
covered the city as completely as the dome of fog. The air was
cooler than outside, but just as arid. Dust grated under foot on
pale smooth paving stones.</p>

<p>Mat trotted to the nearest fountain anyway, just on
the off chance, and leaned on the waist high white rim. Three
unclothed women, twice as tall as he and supporting an odd
wide-mouthed fish over their heads, peered down into a wide dusty basin
no dryer than his mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Rand said behind him. &ldquo;I should have
thought of this before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat looked over his shoulder. &ldquo;Thought of what?&rdquo; Rand
was staring at the fountain, shaking with silent laughter. &ldquo;Get
hold of yourself, Rand. You didn&rsquo;t go crazy in the last minute. You
should have thought of what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A hollow gurgling whipped Mat&rsquo;s eyes back to the
fountain. Abruptly water gushed out of the fish&rsquo;s mouth, a stream
as thick as his leg. He scrambled into the basin and ran to stand
under the downpour, head back and mouth open. Cold sweet water,
cold enough to make him shiver, sweeter than wine. It soaked his
hair, his coat, his breeches. He drank until he thought he would
drown, finally staggering over to lean panting against a woman&rsquo;s
stone leg.</p>

<p>Rand was still standing there staring at the
fountain, face red and lips cracked, laughing softly. &ldquo;No water,
Mat. They said we couldn&rsquo;t bring water, but they did not say
anything about what was already here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand? Aren&rsquo;t you going to drink?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand gave a start, then stepped into the now ankle
deep basin and splashed across to stand where Mat had been,
drinking in the same way, eyes closed and face tilted up to let the
water pour over him.</p>

<p>Mat watched worriedly. Not mad, exactly; not yet. But
how long would Rand have stood there laughing while thirst turned
his throat to stone if he had not spoken? Mat left him there and
climbed out of the fountain. Some of the water drenching his
clothes had seeped down into his boots. He ignored the squish he
made at every step; he was not sure he could get his boots back on
if he pulled them off. Besides, it felt good.</p>

<p>Peering at the city, he wondered what he was doing
there. Those people had said he would die, otherwise, but was just
being in Rhuidean enough? <em>Do I have to do something?
What?</em></p>

<p>The empty streets and half-finished palaces were
shadowless in the pale azure light. A prickling grew between his
shoulder blades. All those empty windows looking down on him, all
those gap-toothed lines of forsaken stonework. Anything could be
hiding in there, and in a place like this, anything could be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Any bloody thing at all</em>. He wished he still had his boot
knives, at least. But those women, those Wise Ones, had stared at
him as if they knew he was holding out on them. And they had
channeled, one or all of them. It was not wise to step on the wrong
side of women who could channel if you could avoid it. <em>Burn me,
if I could get shut of Aes Sedai, I&rsquo;d never ask for another thing.
Well, not for a good long while, anyway. Light, I wonder if
anything is hiding in here</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The heart has to be that way, Mat.&rdquo; Rand was
climbing out of the basin, dripping wet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The heart?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Wise Ones said I had to go to the heart. They
must mean the center of the city.&rdquo; Rand looked back at the fountain
and suddenly the flow dwindled to a trickle, then ceased. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
an ocean of good water down there. Deep. So deep I nearly didn&rsquo;t
find it. If I could bring it up&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;No need to waste it, though.
We can get another good drink when it&rsquo;s time to leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat shifted his feet uncomfortably. <em>Fool! Where
did you think it came from? Of course he bloody channeled. Did you
think it just started flowing again after the Light knows how
long?</em> &ldquo;Center of the city. Of course. Lead on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They kept to the middle of the wide street, walking
along the edge of the bare strips of dirt, past more dry fountains,
some with only the stone basin and a marble base where the statues
should have been. Nothing was broken in the city, only&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;incomplete. The palaces loomed to either side like cliffs. There
had to be things inside. Furniture, maybe, if it had not rotted.
Maybe gold. Knives. Knives would not rust away in this dry air no
matter how long they had been there.</p>

<p><em>There could be a bloody Myrddraal in there for
all you know. Light, why did I have to think of that?</em> If only
he had thought to bring a quarterstaff with him when he left the
Stone. Maybe he could have convinced the Wise Ones it was a walking
staff. No use thinking of it, now. A tree would do, if he had a way
to cut a good branch and trim it. If, again. He wondered whether
whoever built this city had managed to grow any trees. He had
worked on his father&rsquo;s farm too long not to know good dirt when he
saw it. These long ribbons of exposed soil were poor, no good for
growing anything besides weeds, and not many of those. None,
now.</p>

<p>After they had walked a mile, the street suddenly
ended at a great plaza, perhaps as far across as they had walked
and surrounded by those palaces of marble and crystal. Startlingly,
a tree stood in the huge square, a good hundred feet tall and
spreading its thick, leafy limbs over a hide of dusty white paving
stones, near what appeared to be concentric rings of clear,
glittering glass columns, thin as needles compared to their height,
nearly as much as the tree&rsquo;s. He would have wondered how a tree
could grow here, without sunlight, if he had not been too busy
staring at the astounding jumble filling the rest of the
square.</p>

<p>A clear lane led from each street Mat could see,
straight to the columned rings, but in the spaces between, statues
stood haphazardly, life-sized down to half that, in stone or
crystal or metal, set right down on the pavement. All among them
were&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He did not know what to call them, at first. A flat
silvery ring, ten feet across and thin as a blade. A tapering
crystal plinth a pace tall that might have held one of the smaller
statues. A shiny black metal spire, narrow as a spear and no
longer, yet standing on end as if rooted. Hundreds of things, maybe
thousands, in every shape imaginable, every material imaginable,
dotting the huge plaza with no more than a dozen feet between any
two.</p>

<p>It was the black metal spear, so unnaturally erect,
that suddenly told him what they must be. <em>Ter&rsquo;angreal</em>.
Some sort of things to do with the Power, anyway. Some of them had
to be. That twisted stone doorway in the Stone&rsquo;s Great Holding had
resisted falling over, too.</p>

<p>He was ready to turn around and go back right then,
but Rand continued on, barely looking at what lined his way. Once
Rand paused, staring down at two figurines that hardly seemed to
deserve a place with the other things. Two statuettes maybe a foot
tall, a man and a woman, each holding a crystal sphere aloft in one
hand. He half bent as if to touch them, but straightened so quickly
it could almost have been Mat&rsquo;s imagination.</p>

<p>After a minute, Mat followed, hurrying to catch up.
The closer they came to the scintillating rings of columns, the
more he tensed. Those things all around them had to do with the
Power, and so did the columns. He just knew it. Those impossibly
tall thin shafts sparkled in the bluish light, dazzling the eye.
<em>All they said was I had to come here. Well, I&rsquo;m here. They
didn&rsquo;t say anything about the bloody Power</em>.</p>

<p>Rand stopped so suddenly that Mat went three strides
nearer the columned rings before realizing it. Rand was staring at
the tree, Mat saw. The tree. Mat found himself moving toward it as
if drawn. No tree had those trefoil leaves. No tree but one; a tree
of legend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Avendesora</em>,&rdquo; Rand said softly. &ldquo;The Tree of
Life. It&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Under the spreading branches, Mat leaped to catch one
of those leaves; his outstretched fingers fell a good pace short of
the lowest. He satisfied himself with walking deeper beneath that
leafy roof and leaning back against the thick bole. After a moment
he slid down to sit against it. The old stories were true. He felt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Contentment. Peace. Well being. Even his feet did not bother
him much.</p>

<p>Rand sat down cross-legged nearby. &ldquo;I can believe the
stories. Ghoetam, sitting beneath <em>Avendesora</em> for forty
years to gain wisdom. Right now, I can believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat let his head fall back against the trunk. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;d trust birds to bring me food, though. You&rsquo;d
have to get up sometime.&rdquo; <em>But an hour or so would not be bad.
Even all day</em>. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t make sense anyway. What kind of food
could birds bring in here? What birds?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe Rhuidean wasn&rsquo;t always like this, Mat. Maybe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe <em>Avendesora</em> was somewhere else,
then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somewhere else,&rdquo; Mat murmured. &ldquo;I would not mind
being somewhere else.&rdquo; <em>It feels</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>good</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>though</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somewhere else?&rdquo; Rand twisted around to look at the
tall thin columns, shining so close. &ldquo;Duty is heavier than a
mountain,&rdquo; he sighed.</p>

<p>That was part of a saying he had picked up in the
Borderlands. &ldquo;Death is lighter than a feather, duty heavier than a
mountain.&rdquo; It sounded like pure foolishness to Mat, but Rand was
getting up. Mat copied him reluctantly. &ldquo;What do you think we&rsquo;ll
find in there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I have to go on alone from here,&rdquo; Rand said
slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Mat demanded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come this
far, haven&rsquo;t I? I am not going to turn tail now.&rdquo; <em>Wouldn&rsquo;t I
just like to, though!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that, Mat. If you go in there, you come out
a clan chief, or you die. Or come out mad. I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s
any other choice. Unless maybe the Wise Ones go in there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat hesitated. <em>To die and live again</em>. That
was what they had said. He had no intention of trying to be an Aiel
clan chief, though; the Aiel would probably stick spears through
him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll leave it to luck,&rdquo; he said, pulling the Tar Valon mark
from his pocket. &ldquo;Getting to be my lucky coin. Flame, I go in with
you; head, I stay out.&rdquo; He flipped the gold coin quickly, before
Rand could object.</p>

<p>Somehow he missed grabbing it; the mark careened off
his fingertips, clinked to the pavement, bounced twice&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;And
landed on edge.</p>

<p>He glared at Rand accusingly. &ldquo;Do you do this sort of
thing on purpose? Can&rsquo;t you control it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; The coin fell over, showing an ageless woman&rsquo;s
face surrounded by stars. &ldquo;It looks like you stay out here,
Mat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; He wished Rand would not
channel around him. &ldquo;Oh, burn me, if you want me to stay out here,
I&rsquo;ll stay.&rdquo; Snatching the coin up, he stuffed it back into his
pocket. &ldquo;Listen, you go in, do whatever it is you have to, and get
back out. I want to leave this place, and I am not going to stand
here forever twiddling my thumbs waiting for you. And you needn&rsquo;t
think I&rsquo;ll come in after you, either, so you had best be
careful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t think that of you, Mat,&rdquo; Rand said.</p>

<p>Mat stared at him suspiciously. What was he grinning
at? &ldquo;So long as you understand I won&rsquo;t. Aaah, go on and be a bloody
Aiel chief. You have the face for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come in there, Mat. Whatever happens, don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
He waited until Mat nodded before turning away.</p>

<p>Mat stood, watching him walk in among the glittering
columns. In the shifting dazzle he seemed to vanish almost
immediately. <em>A trick of the eye</em>, Mat told himself. That
was all it was. <em>A bloody trick of the eye</em>.</p>

<p>He started around the array, keeping well back,
peering in an effort to spot Rand again. &ldquo;You look out what you&rsquo;re
bloody doing,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;You leave me alone in the Waste with
Moiraine and the bloody Aiel, and I&rsquo;ll strangle you, Dragon Reborn
or no!&rdquo; After a minute, he added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not coming in there after
you if you get yourself in trouble! You hear me?&rdquo; There was no
answer. <em>If he&rsquo;s not out of there in an hour</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s
mad just going in there,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll not be the one
to pull his bacon off the coals. He&rsquo;s the one who can channel. If
he&rsquo;s put his head in a hornets&rsquo; nest, he can bloody channel his way
out of it.&rdquo; <em>I&rsquo;ll give him an hour</em>. And then he would
leave, whether Rand was back or not. Just turn around and leave.
Just go. That was what he would do. He would.</p>

<p>The way those thin shafts of glass caught the bluish
light, refracting and reflecting, merely looking too hard was
enough to give him a headache. He turned away, wandering back the
way he had come, uneasily eyeing the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>&mdash;or
whatever they were&mdash;filling the plaza. What was he doing
there? Why?</p>

<p>Suddenly he stopped dead, staring at one of those
strange objects. A large doorframe of polished redstone, twisted in
some way he could not quite catch so his eye seemed to slip trying
to follow it around. Slowly he made his way to it, between
glittering faceted spires as tall as his head and low golden frames
filled with what appeared to be sheets of glass, barely noticing
them, never taking his eyes off the doorway.</p>

<p>It was the same. The same polished redstone, the same
size, the same eye wrenching corners. Along each upright ran three
lines of triangles, points down. Had the one in Tear had those? He
could not remember; he had not been trying to remember all the
details last time. It <em>was</em> the same; it had to be. Maybe he
could not step through the other again, but this one&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?
Another chance to get at those snake people, make them answer a few
more questions.</p>

<p>Squinting against the glitters, he peered back toward
the columns. An hour, he had given Rand. In an hour, he could be
through this thing and back with time to spare. Maybe it would not
even work for him, since he had used its twin. <em>They</em> are
<em>the same</em>. Then again, maybe it would. It just meant
rubbing up against the Power one more time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;<em>Ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. Portal
Stones. Rhuidean. What difference can one more time make?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stepped through. Through a wall of blinding white
light, through a roar so vast it annihilated sound.</p>

<p>Blinking, he looked around and bit back the vilest
oath he knew. Wherever this was, it was not where he had gone
before.</p>

<p>The twisted doorway stood in the middle of a huge
chamber that appeared to be star-shaped, as near as he could make
out through a forest of thick columns, each deeply fluted with
eight ridges, the sharp edges yellow and glowing softly for light.
Glossy black except for the glowing bits, they rose from a dull
white floor into murky gloom far overhead where even the yellow
stripes faded away. The columns and floor almost looked to be
glass, but when he bent to rub a hand across the floor, it felt
like stone. Dusty stone. He wiped his hand on his coat. The air had
a musty smell, and his own footprints were the only marks in the
dust. No one had been here in a very long time.</p>

<p>Disappointed, he turned back to the <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very long time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat spun back, snatching at his coatsleeve for a
knife that was lying back on the mountainside. The man standing
among the columns looked nothing at all like the snaky folk. He
made Mat regret giving up those last blades to the Wise Ones.</p>

<p>The fellow was tall, taller than an Aiel, and sinewy,
but with shoulders too wide for his narrow waist, and skin as white
as the finest paper. Pale leather straps studded with silver
crisscrossed his arms and bare chest, and a black kilt hung to his
knees. His eyes were too big and almost colorless, set deep in a
narrow jawed face. His short cut, palely reddish hair stood up like
a brush, and his ears, lying flat against his head, had a hint of a
point at the top. He leaned toward Mat, inhaling, opening his mouth
to pull in more air, flashing sharp teeth. The impression he gave
was of a fox about to leap on a cornered chicken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very long time,&rdquo; he said, straightening. His voice
was rough, almost a growl. &ldquo;Do you abide by the treaties and
agreements? Do you carry iron, or instruments of music, or devices
for making light?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have none of those things,&rdquo; Mat replied slowly.
This was not the same place, but this fellow asked the same
questions. And he behaved the same, with all that smelling. <em>
Rummaging through my bloody experiences, is he? Well, let him.
Maybe he&rsquo;ll jog some loose so I can remember them, too</em>. He
wondered if he was speaking the Old Tongue again. It was
uncomfortable, not knowing, not being able to tell. &ldquo;If you can
take me to where I can get a few questions answered, lead the way.
If not, I will be going, with apologies for bothering you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Those big colorless eyes blinked in agitation.
&ldquo;You must not go. Come. I will take you where you may find what you
need. Come.&rdquo; He backed away, gesturing with both hands. &ldquo;Come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Glancing at the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, Mat followed.
He wished the man had not grinned at him just then. Maybe he meant
to be reassuring, but those teeth&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Mat decided he would never
give up <em>all</em> of his knives again, not for Wise Ones or the
Amyrlin Seat herself.</p>

<p>The large five-sided doorway looked more like a
tunnel mouth, for the corridor beyond was exactly the same size and
shape, with those softly glowing yellow strips running along the
bends, edging floor and ceiling. It seemed to stretch ahead
forever, fading into a murky distance, broken at intervals by more
of the great five-sided doorways. The kilted man did not turn to
lead until they were both in the hallway, and even then he kept
glancing over a wide shoulder as if to make certain Mat was still
there. The air was no longer musty; instead it held a faint hint of
something unpleasant, something tickling familiarity but not strong
enough to recognize.</p>

<p>At the first of the doorways, Mat glanced through in
passing, and sighed. Beyond star-shaped black columns, a twisted
red stone doorway stood on a dull glassy white floor where dust
showed the marks of one set of boots coming from the <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, led toward the corridor by the prints of narrow
bare feet. He looked over his shoulder. Instead of ending fifty
paces back in another chamber like this, the hallway ran back as
far as he could see, a mirror image of what lay ahead. His guide
gave him a sharp-toothed smile; the fellow looked hungry.</p>

<p>He knew he should have expected something of the sort
after what he had seen on the other side of the doorway in the
Stone. Those spires moving from where they should be to where they
could not, logically. If spires, why not rooms. <em>I should have
stayed out there waiting for Rand, is what I should have done. I
should have done a lot of things</em>. At least he would have no
trouble finding the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> again, if all of the
doorways ahead were the same.</p>

<p>He peered into the next and saw black columns, the
redstone <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, his footprints and his guide&rsquo;s in
the dust. When the narrow jawed man looked over his shoulder again,
Mat gave him. a toothy grin. &ldquo;Never think you have caught a babe in
your snare. If you try to cheat me, I will have your hide for a
saddlecloth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fellow started, pale eyes widening, then shrugged
and adjusted the silver studded straps across his chest; his
mocking smile seemed tailored to draw attention to what he was
doing. Suddenly Mat found himself wondering where that pale leather
came from. Surely not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Oh, Light, I think it is</em>. He
managed to stop himself from swallowing, but only just. &ldquo;Lead, you
son of a goat. Your hide is not worth silver studding. Take me
where I want to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a snarl, the man hurried on, stiff-backed. Mat
did not care if the fellow was offended. He did wish he had just
one knife, though. <em>I&rsquo;ll be burned if I&rsquo;ll let some fox-faced
goat brain make a harness out of</em> my <em>hide</em>.</p>

<p>There was no way of telling how long they walked. The
corridor never changed, with its bent walls and its glowing yellow
strips. Every doorway showed the identical chamber, <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>,
footprints and all. The sameness made time slip into formlessness.
Mat worried about how long he had been there. Surely longer than
the hour he had given himself. His clothes were only damp now; his
boots no longer made squishing noises. But he walked, staring at
his guide&rsquo;s back, and walked.</p>

<p>Suddenly the corridor ended ahead in another doorway.
Mat blinked. He could have sworn that a moment before the hall had
stretched on as far as he could see. But he had been watching the
sharp-toothed fellow more than what lay ahead. He looked back, and
nearly swore. The corridor ran back until the glowing yellow strips
seemed to come together in a point. And there was not an opening to
be seen anywhere along it.</p>

<p>When he turned, he was alone in front of the big
five-sided doorway. <em>Burn me, I wish they wouldn&rsquo;t do that</em>.
Taking a deep breath, he walked through.</p>

<p>It was another white-floored star-shaped chamber, not
so large as the one&mdash;or ones&mdash;with columns. An
eight-pointed star with a glassy black pedestal standing in each
point, like a two span slice out of one of those columns. Glowing
yellow strips ran up the sharp edges of room and pedestals. The
unpleasant smell was stronger here; he recognized it now. The smell
of a wild animal&rsquo;s lair. He hardly noticed it, though, because the
chamber was empty except for him.</p>

<p>Turning slowly, he frowned at the pedestals. Surely
someone should be up on them, whoever was supposed to answer his
questions. He was being cheated. If he could come here, he should
be able to get answers.</p>

<p>Suddenly he spun in a circle, searching not the
pedestals but the smooth gray walls. The doorway was gone; there
was no way out.</p>

<p>Yet before he completed a second turn there was
someone standing on each pedestal, people like his guide, but
dressed differently. Four were men, the others women, their stiff
hair rising in a crest before spilling down their backs. All wore
long white skirts that hid their feet. The women had on white
blouses that fell below their hips, with high lace necks and pale
ruffles at their wrists. The men wore even more straps than the
guide, wider and studded with gold. Each harness supported a pair
of bare bladed knives on the wearer&rsquo;s chest. Bronze blades, Mat
judged from the color, but he would have given all the gold in his
possession for just one of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; one of the women said in that growling
voice. &ldquo;By the ancient treaty, here is agreement made. What is your
need? Speak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat hesitated. That was not what the snaky people had
said. They were all staring at him like foxes staring at dinner.
&ldquo;Who is the Daughter of the Nine Moons and why do I have to marry
her?&rdquo; He hoped they would count that as one question.</p>

<p>No one answered. None of them spoke. They just
continued to stare at him with those big pale eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are supposed to answer,&rdquo; he said. Silence. &ldquo;Burn
your bones to ash, answer me! Who is the Daughter of the Nine Moons
and why do I have to marry her? How will I die and live again? What
does it mean that I have to give up half the light of the world?
Those are my three questions. Say something!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dead silence. He could hear himself breathing, hear
the blood throbbing in his ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no intention of marrying. And I have no
intention of dying, either, whether I am supposed to live again or
not. I walk around with holes in my memory, holes in my life, and
you stare at me like idiots. If I had my way, I would want those
holes filled, but at least answers to my questions might fill some
in my future. You have to answer&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Done,&rdquo; one of the men growled, and Mat blinked.</p>

<p>Done? What was done? What did he mean? &ldquo;Burn your
eyes,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Burn your souls! You are as bad as Aes Sedai.
Well, I want a way to be free of Aes Sedai and the Power, and I
want to be away from you and back to Rhuidean, if you will not
answer me. Open up a door, and let me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Done,&rdquo; another man said, and one of the women
echoed, &ldquo;Done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat scanned the walls, then glared, turning to take
them all in, standing up there on their pedestals staring down at
him. &ldquo;Done? What is done? I see no door. You lying goat-fathered&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fool,&rdquo; a woman said in a whispered growl, and others
repeated it. Fool. Fool. Fool.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wise to ask leavetaking, when you set no price, no
terms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet fool not to first agree on price.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will set the price.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They spoke so quickly he could not tell which said
what.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was asked will be given.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The price will be paid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn you,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;what are you talking &rdquo;</p>

<p>Utter darkness closed around him. There was something
around his throat. He could not breathe. Air. He could not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
