<h4><em>Hard Heads</em></h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">E</span>layne
was not certain Rand realized she was still in
the room, the way he stared after Egwene with a half-bewildered
expression. Now and again he shook his head as if arguing with
himself, or trying to straighten his mind. She was content to wait
him out. Anything that put off the moment a while longer. She
concentrated on maintaining an outward composure, back straight and
head high, hands folded in her lap, a calmness on her face that
could have rivaled Moiraine&rsquo;s best. Butterflies the size of
hedgehogs frolicked in her stomach.</p>

<p>It was not fear of him channeling. She had let go of
<em>saidar</em> as soon as Egwene stood to leave. She wanted to
trust him, and she had to. It was what she wanted to happen that
had her trembling inside. She had to concentrate not to finger her
necklace or fiddle with the strand of sapphires in her hair. Was
her perfume too heavy? No. Egwene said he liked the smell of roses.
The dress. She wanted to tug it up, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He turned&mdash;the slight limp in his step
tightened her lips thoughtfully&mdash;saw her sitting in her
chair, and gave a start, eyes widening with what seemed very close
to panic. She was glad to see it; the effort of keeping her own
face serene had leaped tenfold as soon as his eyes touched her.
Those eyes were blue now, like a misty morning sky.</p>

<p>He recovered on the instant and made a quite
unnecessary bow, wiping his hands once nervously on his coat. &ldquo;I
did not realize you were still&mdash;&rdquo; Flushing, he cut off;
forgetting her presence might be taken as an insult. &ldquo;I mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that is, I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He took a deep breath and began
again. &ldquo;I am not as much of a fool as I sound, my Lady. It isn&rsquo;t
every day someone tells you they don&rsquo;t love you, my Lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put on a tone of mock severity. &ldquo;If you call me
that again, I shall call you my Lord Dragon. And curtsy. Even the
Queen of Andor might curtsy to you, and I am only
Daughter-Heir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light! Don&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo; He seemed uneasy out of all
proportion to the threat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not, Rand,&rdquo; she said in a more serious voice,
&ldquo;if you call me by my name. Elayne. Say it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elayne.&rdquo; He spoke awkwardly, yet, delightfully, as
if he were savoring the name, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; It was absurd to be so pleased; all he had
done was say her name, after all. There was something she had to
know before she could go on. &ldquo;Did it hurt you very much?&rdquo; That
could be taken two ways, she realized. &ldquo;What Egwene told you, I
mean. &rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Yes. Some. I don&rsquo;t know. Fair is fair, after
all.&rdquo; His small grin took some of the edge off of his wariness. &ldquo;I
sound a fool again, don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Not to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told her the pure truth, but I don&rsquo;t think she
believed me. I suppose I did not want to believe it of her, either.
Not really. If that isn&rsquo;t foolish, I don&rsquo;t know what is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you tell me one more time that you are a fool, I
may begin to believe it.&rdquo; <em>He won&rsquo;t try to hold on to her; I
won&rsquo;t have to deal with that</em>. Her voice was calm, with a light
enough tone to let him know she did not really mean what she said.
&ldquo;I saw a Cairhienin lord&rsquo;s fool, once, a man in a funny striped
coat, too big for him and sewn with bells. You would look silly
wearing bells.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I would,&rdquo; he said ruefully. &ldquo;I will
remember that.&rdquo; His slow grin was wider this time, warming his
whole face.</p>

<p>The butterflies&rsquo; wings flogged her for haste, but she
occupied herself with straightening her skirts. She had to go
slowly, carefully. <em>If I don&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;ll think I am just a foolish
girl. And he will be right</em>. The butterflies in her belly were
beating kettle drums, now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you like a flower?&rdquo; he asked suddenly, and she
blinked in confusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A flower?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Striding to the bed, he scooped up a double
handful of feathers from the tattered mattress and held them out to
her. &ldquo;I made one for the majhere last night. You&rsquo;d have thought I
had given her the Stone. But yours will be much prettier,&rdquo; he added
hastily. &ldquo;Much prettier. I promise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will be careful. It takes only a trickle of the
Power. Just a thread, and I will be very careful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trust. She had to trust him. It was a small surprise
to realize that she did. &ldquo;I would like that, Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For long moments he stared at the fluffy mound in his
hands, a slow frown on his face. Abruptly he let the feathers fall,
dusting his hands. &ldquo;Flowers,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s no fit gift for
you.&rdquo; Her heart went out to him; clearly he had tried to embrace
<em>saidin</em> and failed. Masking disappointment in action, he
limped hurriedly to the metallic cloth and began gathering it over
his arm. &ldquo;Now this is a proper gift for the Daughter-Heir of Andor.
You could have a seamstress make&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He floundered over what a
seamstress might make from a four-pace length of gold-and-silver
cloth, less than two feet wide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure a seamstress will have many ideas,&rdquo; she
told him diplomatically. Pulling a handkerchief from her sleeve,
she knelt for a moment to collect the feathers he had dropped into
the square of pale blue silk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The maids will take care of that,&rdquo; he said as she
tucked the small bundle securely into her belt pouch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, this bit is done.&rdquo; How could he understand
that she would keep the feathers because he had wanted them to be a
flower? He shifted his feet, holding the glittering folds as if he
did not know what to do with them. &ldquo;The majhere must have
seamstresses,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;I will give that to one of them.&rdquo; He
brightened, smiling; she saw no reason to tell him she meant it as
a gift. Those thundering butterflies would not let her hold back
any longer. &ldquo;Rand, do you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;like me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like you?&rdquo; he frowned. &ldquo;Of course, I like you. I
like you very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Did he have to look as if he did not understand at
all? &ldquo;I am fond of you, Rand.&rdquo; She was startled that she said it so
calmly; her stomach seemed to be trying to writhe up into her
throat, and her hands and feet felt like ice. &ldquo;More than fond.&rdquo;
That was enough; she was not going to make a fool of herself. <em>
He has to say more than &ldquo;like,&rdquo; first</em>. She almost giggled
hysterically. <em>I will keep control of myself. I will not let him
see me behave like a moon-eyed girl. I will not</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am fond of you,&rdquo; he said slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not usually so forward.&rdquo; No; that might make
him think of Berelain. There was red in his cheeks; he <em>was</em>
thinking of Berelain. Burn him! Her voice came as smooth as silk.
&ldquo;Soon I will have to go, Rand. To leave Tear. I may not see you
again for months.&rdquo; <em>Or ever</em>, a tiny voice cried in her
head. She refused to listen. &ldquo;I could not go without letting you
know how I feel. And I am&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;very fond of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elayne, I <em>am</em> fond of you. I feel&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I
want&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; The scarlet spots on his cheeks grew. &ldquo;Elayne, I don&rsquo;t
know what to say, how to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly it was her face that was flaming. He must
think she was trying to force him into saying more. <em>Aren&rsquo;t
you?</em> the small voice mocked, which only made her cheeks
hotter. &ldquo;Rand, I am not asking for&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Light! How to say it? &ldquo;I
only wanted you to know how I feel. That is all.&rdquo; Berelain would
not have let it go at that. Berelain would have been wrapped around
him by now. Telling herself she would not let that half-dressed
snip better her, she moved closer to him, took the glittering cloth
from his arm, and dropped it on the carpet. For some reason he
seemed taller than he ever had before. &ldquo;Rand&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Rand, I want
you to kiss me.&rdquo; There. It was out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kiss you?&rdquo; he said as if he had never heard of
kissing before. &ldquo;Elayne, I don&rsquo;t want to promise more than&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I
mean, it isn&rsquo;t as if we were betrothed. Not that I am suggesting we
should be. It&rsquo;s just that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I <em>am</em> fond of you, Elayne.
More than fond. I just do not want you to think I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had to laugh at him, with all his confused
earnestness. &ldquo;I do not know how things are done in the Two Rivers,
but in Caemlyn you don&rsquo;t wait until you are betrothed before
kissing a girl. And it does not mean you must become betrothed,
either. But perhaps you do not know how&mdash;&rdquo; His arms went
around her almost roughly, and his lips came down on hers. Her head
spun; her toes tried to curl up in her slippers. Some time later&mdash;she was not certain how long&mdash;she realized she was
leaning against his chest, knees trembling, trying to gulp air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me for interrupting you,&rdquo; he said. She was
glad to hear a touch of breathlessness in his voice. &ldquo;I am just a
backward shepherd from the Two Rivers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are uncouth,&rdquo; she murmured against his shirt,
&ldquo;and you did not shave this morning, but I would not say you are
backward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elayne, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put a hand over his mouth. &ldquo;I do not want to hear
anything from you that you do not mean with your whole heart,&rdquo; she
said firmly. &ldquo;Not now, or ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He nodded, not as if he understood why, but at least
as if he understood that she meant what she said. Straightening her
hair&mdash;the strand of sapphires was tangled beyond mending
without a mirror&mdash;she stepped out of his encircling arms, not
without reluctance; it would be all too easy to remain there, and
she had already been more forward than she had ever dreamed of
before. Speaking up like that; asking for a kiss. Asking! She was
not Berelain.</p>

<p>Berelain. Perhaps Min had had a viewing. What Min
saw, happened, but she would not share him with Berelain. Perhaps
she needed to do a bit more plain speaking. Obliquely plain, at
least. &ldquo;I expect you will not lack for company after I go. Just
remember that some women see a man with their hearts, while others
see no more than a bauble to wear, no different than a necklace or
a bracelet. Remember that I will come back, and I am one who sees
with her heart.&rdquo; He looked confused, at first, then a little
alarmed. She had said too much, too fast. She had to divert him.
&ldquo;Do you know what you have not said to me? You have not tried to
frighten me away by telling me how dangerous you are. Don&rsquo;t try
now. It is too late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not think of it.&rdquo; Another thought came to him,
though, and his eyes crinkled with suspicion. &ldquo;Did you and Egwene
scheme this up between you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She managed to combine wide-eyed innocence with mild
outrage. &ldquo;How could you even consider such a thing? Do you imagine
we would hand you around between us like a package? You think a
good deal of yourself. There is such a thing as being overproud.&rdquo;
He did look confused, now. Quite satisfactory. &ldquo;Are you sorry for
what you did to us, Rand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not mean to frighten you,&rdquo; he said hesitantly.
&ldquo;Egwene made me angry; she&rsquo;s always been able to without half
trying. That&rsquo;s no excuse, I know. I said I was sorry, and I am.
Look what it got me. Burned tables and another mattress
ruined.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And for&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the pinch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His face reddened again, but he faced her firmly even
so. &ldquo;No. No, I am not sorry for that. The two of you, talking over
my head, as if I were a lump of wood with no ears. You deserved as
much, both of you, and I won&rsquo;t say different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment she considered him. He rubbed his arms
through his coat sleeves as she momentarily embraced <em>
saidar</em>. She did not know Healing to any degree, but she had
learned bits and pieces on the edge of it. Channeling, she soothed
away the hurt she had given him for the pinch. His eyes widened in
surprise, and he shifted on his feet as if testing the absence of
pain. &ldquo;For being honest,&rdquo; she told him simply.</p>

<p>There was a rap at the door, and Gaul looked in. At
first the Aielman had his head down, but after a quick glance at
them he raised it. Color flooded Elayne&rsquo;s face as she realized he
had suspected that he might be interrupting something he should not
see. She very nearly embraced <em>saidar</em> again and taught him
a lesson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Tairens are here,&rdquo; Gaul said. &ldquo;The High Lords
you were expecting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go, then,&rdquo; she told Rand. &ldquo;You must tell them
about&mdash;taxes, was it not? Think on what I have said.&rdquo; She did
not say &ldquo;think of me,&rdquo; but she was sure the effect would be the
same.</p>

<p>He reached out as if to stop her, but she slipped
away from him. She had no intention of putting on a display in
front of Gaul. The man was Aiel, but what must he think of her,
wearing perfume and sapphires at that hour of the morning? It
required real effort not to pull the neckline of her dress up
higher.</p>

<p>The High Lords entered as she reached the door, a
cluster of graying men in pointed beards and colorful, ornate coats
with puffy sleeves. They crowded out of her way with reluctant
bows, their bland faces and polite murmurs not hiding their relief
that she was leaving.</p>

<p>She glanced back once from the doorway. A tall,
broad-shouldered young man in a plain green coat among the High
Lords in their silks and satin stripes, Rand looked like a stork
among peacocks, yet there was something about him, a presence that
said he commanded there by right. The Tairens recognized it,
bending their stiff necks reluctantly. He thought probably they
bowed just because he was the Dragon Reborn, and perhaps they
thought so, too. But she had seen men, like Gareth Bryne, the
Captain-Commander of her mother&rsquo;s Guards, who could have dominated
a room in rags, with no title and no one knowing their name. Rand
might not know it, but he was such a man. He had not been when she
first saw him, but he was now. She pulled the door shut behind
her.</p>

<p>The Aiel around the entrance glanced at her, and the
captain commanding the ring of Defenders in the middle of the
anteroom stared uneasily, but she barely noticed them. It was done.
Or at least it was begun. Four days she had before Joiya and Amico
were put on that ship, four days at most to twine herself so firmly
into Rand&rsquo;s thoughts that he had no room for Berelain. Of if not
that, firmly enough that she stayed inside his head until she had
the chance to do more. She had never thought she might do a thing
like this, stalk a man like a huntress stalking a wild boar. The
butterflies were still gamboling in her stomach. At least she had
not let him see how nervous she was. And it occurred to her that
she had not once thought of what her mother would say. With that,
the flutterings vanished. She did not care what her mother said.
Morgase had to accept her daughter as a woman; that was all there
was to it.</p>

<p>The Aiel bowed as she moved away, and she
acknowledged them with a gracious nod that would have done Morgase
proud. Even the Tairen captain looked at her as if he could see her
new serenity. She did not think she would be troubled by
butterflies again. For the Black Ajah perhaps, but not for
Rand.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Ignoring the High Lords in their anxious semicircle,
Rand watched the door close behind Elayne with wonder in his eyes.
Dreams coming true, even only this much, made him uneasy. A swim in
the Waterwood was one thing, but he would never have believed a
dream where she came to him like this. She had been so cool and
collected, while he was tripping over his own tongue. And Egwene,
giving his own thoughts back to him and only concerned she might
hurt him. Why was it women could go to pieces or fly into a rage at
the smallest thing, yet never flicker an eyelash at what left you
gaping?</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord Dragon?&rdquo; Sunamon murmured even more
diffidently than usual. Word of this morning must have spread
through the Stone already; that first lot had nearly run on their
way out, and it was doubtful Torean would show his face, or his
filthy suggestions, anywhere Rand was.</p>

<p>Sunamon essayed an ingratiating smile, then smothered
it, drywashing his plump hands, when Rand only looked at him. The
rest pretended they did not see the burned tables, or the shattered
mattress and scattered books, or the half-melted lumps over the
fireplace that had been the stag and wolves. High Lords were good
at seeing only what they wanted to see. Carleon and Tedosian, false
self-effacement in every line of their thick bodies, surely never
realized there was anything suspicious in never looking at one
another. But then, Rand might never have noticed if not for Thom&rsquo;s
note, found in the pocket of a coat just back from being
brushed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Lord Dragon wished to see us?&rdquo; Sunamon
managed.</p>

<p>Could Egwene and Elayne have worked it up between
them? Of course not. Women did not do things like that any more
than men. Did they? It had to be coincidence. Elayne heard that he
was free and decided to speak. That was it. &ldquo;Taxes,&rdquo; he barked. The
Tairens did not move, but they gave the impression of stepping
back. How he hated dealing with these men; he wanted to dive back
into the books.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a bad precedent, my Lord Dragon, lowering
taxes,&rdquo; a lean, gray-haired man said in an oily voice. Meilan was
tall for a Tairen, only a hand shorter than Rand, and hard as any
Defender. He held himself in a stoop in Rand&rsquo;s presence; his dark
eyes showed how he hated it. But he had hated it when Rand told
them to stop crouching around him, too. None of them straightened,
but Meilan especially had not liked being reminded of what he did.
&ldquo;The peasants have always paid easily, but if we lower their taxes,
when the day comes that we raise them back to where they now are,
the fools will complain as bitterly as if we had doubled the
present levy. There might well be riots when that day comes, my
Lord Dragon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand strode across the room to stand before <em>
Callandor</em>; the crystal sword glittered, outshining the gilt
and gemstones surrounding it. A reminder of who he was, of the
power he could wield. Egwene. It was foolish to feel hurt because
she said she no longer loved him. Why should he expect her to have
feelings for him that he did not have for her? Yet it did hurt. A
relief, but not a pleasant one. &ldquo;You will have riots if you drive
men off their farms.&rdquo; Three books stood in a stack almost by
Meilan&rsquo;s feet. <em>The Treasures of the Stone of Tear, Travels in
the Waste</em>, and <em>Dealings with the Territory of Mayene</em>.
The keys lay in those, and in the various translations of <em>The
Karaethon Cycle</em>, if he could only find them and fit them to
the proper locks. He pushed his mind back to the High Lords. &ldquo;Do
you think they will watch their families starve and do
nothing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Defenders of the Stone have put down riots
before, my Lord Dragon,&rdquo; Sunamon said soothingly. &ldquo;Our own guards
can keep peace in the countryside. The peasants will not disturb
you, I give you my assurance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are too many farmers as it is.&rdquo; Carleon
flinched at Rand&rsquo;s glare. &ldquo;It is the civil war in Cairhien, my Lord
Dragon,&rdquo; he explained hurriedly. &ldquo;The Cairhienin can buy no grain,
and the granaries are bursting. This year&rsquo;s harvest will go to
waste as it is. And next year&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Burn my soul, my Lord Dragon,
but what we need is for some of those peasants to stop their
eternal digging and planting.&rdquo; He seemed to realize he had said too
much, though he clearly did not understand why. Rand wondered
whether he had any idea how food got to his table. Did he see
anything but gold, and power?</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will you do when Cairhien is buying grain
again?&rdquo; Rand said coolly. &ldquo;For that matter, is Cairhien the only
land that needs grain?&rdquo; Why <em>had</em> Elayne spoken up like
that? What <em>did</em> she expect of him? Fond, she said. Women
could play games with words like Aes Sedai. Did she mean she loved
him? No, that was plain foolishness. Overproud to a degree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord Dragon,&rdquo; Meilan said, half subservient, half
as if explaining something to a child, &ldquo;if the civil wars stopped
today, Cairhien still could not buy more than a few bargeloads for
two, even three years. We have always sold our grain to
Cairhien.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Always&mdash;for the twenty years since the Aiel
War. They were so bound up in what they had <em>always</em> done
that they could not see what was so simple. Or would not see it.
When the cabbages sprouted like weeds around Emond&rsquo;s Field, it was
a near certainty that bad rain or whiteworm had struck Deven Ride
or Watch Hill. When Watch Hill had too many turnips, Emond&rsquo;s Field
would have a shortage, or Deven Ride.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Offer it in Illian,&rdquo; he told them. What did Elayne
expect? &ldquo;Or Altara.&rdquo; He did like her, but he liked Min as much. Or
thought he did. It was impossible to sort out his feelings for
either of them. &ldquo;You have ships for the sea as well as riverboats
and barges, and if you don&rsquo;t have enough, hire them from Mayene.&rdquo;
He liked both women, but beyond that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He had spent very
nearly his whole life mooning after Egwene; he was not about to
dive into that again until he was sure. Sure of something. Sure. If
<em>Dealings with the Territory of Mayene</em> was to be believed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Stop this</em>, he told himself. <em>Keep your mind on
these weasels, or they&rsquo;ll find cracks to slip through, and bite you
on the way</em>. &ldquo;Pay with grain; I&rsquo;m sure the First will be
amenable, for a good price. And maybe a signed agreement, a treaty&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; That was a good word; the sort they used. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;pledging to
leave Mayene alone in return for ships.&rdquo; He owed her that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We trade little with Illian, my Lord Dragon. They
are vultures, and scum.&rdquo; Tedosian sounded scandalized, and so did
Meilan when he said, &ldquo;We have always dealt with Mayene from
strength, my Lord Dragon. Never with bent knee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand took a deep breath. The High Lords tensed. It
always came to this. He always tried to reason with them, and it
always failed. Thom said the High Lords had heads as hard as the
Stone, and he was right. <em>What do I feel for her? Dreaming about
her. She&rsquo;s certainly pretty</em>. He was not sure if he meant
Elayne or Min. <em>Stop this! A kiss means no more than a kiss.
Stop it!</em> Putting women firmly out of his head, he set himself
to telling these stone-brained fools what they were going to do.
&ldquo;First, you will cut taxes on farmers by three-quarters, and on
everyone else by half. Don&rsquo;t argue! Just do it! Second, you go to
Berelain and ask&mdash;ask!&mdash;her price for hiring&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The High Lords listened with false smiles and
grinding teeth, but they listened.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Egwene was considering Joiya and Amico when Mat fell
in beside her, just walking down the hallway as if he merely
happened to be going the same way. He was frowning to himself, and
his hair needed brushing, as if he had been scrubbing his fingers
through it. Once or twice he glanced at her but did not speak. The
servants they passed bowed or curtsied, and so did the occasional
High Lords and Ladies, if with markedly less enthusiasm. Mat&rsquo;s
lip-curling stares at the nobles would have brought trouble if she
had not been there, friend of the Lord Dragon or not.</p>

<p>This silence was not like him, not like the Mat she
knew. Except for his fine red coat&mdash;wrinkled as if he had
slept in it&mdash;he seemed no different than the old Mat, yet
they were surely all different now. His quiet was unsettling. &ldquo;Is
last night troubling you?&rdquo; she asked at last.</p>

<p>He missed a step. &ldquo;You know about that? Well, you
would, wouldn&rsquo;t you. Doesn&rsquo;t bother me. Wasn&rsquo;t much to it. Over and
done with now, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She pretended to believe him. &ldquo;Nynaeve and I do not
see much of you.&rdquo; That was a rank understatement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been busy,&rdquo; he muttered with an uncomfortable
shrug, looking everywhere but at her again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dicing?&rdquo; she asked dismissively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cards.&rdquo; A plump maid, curtsying with her arms full
of folded towels, glanced at Egwene and, apparently thinking she
was not looking, winked at Mat. He grinned at her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been busy
playing cards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene&rsquo;s eyebrows rose sharply. That woman had to be
ten years older than Nynaeve. &ldquo;I see. It must use up a great deal
of time. Playing cards. Too much to spare a few moments for old
friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The last time I spared you a moment, you and Nynaeve
tied me up with the Power like a pig for market so you could
rummage through my room. Friends don&rsquo;t steal from friends.&rdquo; He
grimaced. &ldquo;Besides, you&rsquo;re always with that Elayne, with her nose
in the air. Or Moiraine. I do not like&mdash;&rdquo; Clearing his throat,
he shot her a sideways glance. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like taking up your time.
You are busy, from what I hear. Questioning Darkfriends. Doing all
sorts of important things, I should imagine. You know these Tairens
think you are Aes Sedai, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head ruefully. It was Aes Sedai he did
not like. However much of the world Mat saw, nothing would ever
change him. &ldquo;It is not stealing to take back what was supposed to
be a loan,&rdquo; she told him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember you saying anything about a loan.
Aaah, what use do I have for a letter from the Amyrlin? Just get
me in trouble. You could have asked, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She refrained from pointing out that they had asked.
She wanted neither an argument nor a sulky departure. He would not
call it that, of course. This time she would let him get away with
his version. &ldquo;Well, I am glad you are still willing to talk to me.
Was there a special reason for it today?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shoved his fingers through his hair and muttered
to himself. What he needed was his mother to haul him off by his
ear for a long talking to. Egwene counseled herself to patience.
She could be patient when she wanted to. She would not say a word
before he did, if she burst for it.</p>

<p>The corridor opened into a railed colonnade of white
marble, looking down on one of the Stone&rsquo;s few gardens. Large white
blossoms covered a few small, waxy-leafed trees and gave a scent
even sweeter than the banks of red and yellow roses. A sullen
breeze failed to stir the hangings on the inner wall, but it did
cut the morning&rsquo;s growing damp warmth. Mat took a seat on the wide
balustrade with his back against a column and one foot up in front
of him. Peering down into the garden, he finally said, &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;need some advice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He wanted advice from <em>her</em>? She goggled at
him. &ldquo;Whatever I can do to help,&rdquo; she said faintly. He turned his
head to her, and she did her best to assume something like Aes
Sedai calm. &ldquo;What do you want advice about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a ten-pace drop to the garden. Besides, there
were men down there weeding among the roses. If she pushed him
over, he might land on one. A gardener, not a rosebush. &ldquo;How am I
supposed to advise you, then?&rdquo; she asked in a thin voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;trying to decide what to do.&rdquo; He looked
embarrassed; he had a right to, in her opinion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you are not thinking of trying to leave. You
know how important you are. You cannot run away from it, Mat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think I don&rsquo;t know that? I don&rsquo;t think I could
leave if Moiraine told me I could. Believe me, Egwene, I am not
going anywhere. I just want to know what&rsquo;s going to happen.&rdquo; He
gave a rough shake of his head, and his voice grew tighter. &ldquo;What
comes next? What&rsquo;s in these holes in my memory? There are chunks of
my life that aren&rsquo;t even there; they don&rsquo;t exist, as if they never
happened! Why do I find myself spouting gibberish? People say it&rsquo;s
the Old Tongue, but it&rsquo;s goose gabble to me. I want to know,
Egwene. I have to know, before I go as crazy as Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand is not crazy,&rdquo; she said automatically. So Mat
was not trying to run away. That was a pleasant surprise; he had
not seemed to believe in responsibility. But there was pain and
worry in his voice. Mat never worried, or never let anyone see it
if he did. &ldquo;I do not know the answers, Mat,&rdquo; she said gently.
&ldquo;Perhaps Moiraine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; He was on his feet in a bound. &ldquo;No Aes Sedai! I
mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;You&rsquo;re different. I know you, and you aren&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Didn&rsquo;t they teach you anything in the Tower, some trick or other,
something that would serve?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mat, I am sorry. I am so sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His laugh reminded her of their childhood. Just so he
had always laughed when his grandest expectations went astray. &ldquo;Ah,
well, I guess it does not matter. It&rsquo;d still be the Tower, if at
second hand. No offense to you.&rdquo; Just so he had moaned over a
splinter in his finger and treated a broken leg as if it were
nothing at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There might be a way,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;If Moiraine
says it is all right. She might.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moiraine! Haven&rsquo;t you heard a word I said? The last
thing I want is Moiraine meddling. What way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat had always been rash. But he wanted no more than
she did, to know. If only he showed a little sense and caution for
once. A passing Tairen noblewoman with dark braids coiled about her
head, shoulders bare above yellow linen, bent her knee slightly,
looking at them with no expression; she walked on quickly, with a
stiff back. Egwene watched her until she was well beyond earshot,
and they were alone. Unless the gardeners, thirty feet below,
counted. Mat was staring at her expectantly.</p>

<p>In the end, she told him of the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>,
the twisted doorway that held answers on its other side. It was the
dangers she emphasized, the consequences of foolish questions, or
those touching the Shadow, the dangers even Aes Sedai might not
know. She was more than flattered that he had come to her, but he
had to show a little sense. &ldquo;You must remember this, Mat. Frivolous
questions can get you killed, so if you do use it, you will have to
be serious for a change. And you mustn&rsquo;t ask any questions that
touch the Shadow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had listened with greater and greater incredulity.
When she was done, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Three questions? You go in like
Bili, I suppose, spend a night and come out ten years later with a
purse that&rsquo;s always full of gold and a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For once in your life, Matrim Cauthon,&rdquo; she snapped,
&ldquo;do not talk like a fool. You know very well <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>
are not stories. It&rsquo;s the dangers you have to be aware of. Maybe
the answers you seek are inside this one, but you must not try it
before Moiraine says you can. You must promise me that, or I
promise you I will take you to her like a trout on a string. You
know I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave a loud snort. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be a fool if I did try it,
no matter what Moiraine says. Walk into a bloody <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal!</em> It&rsquo;s less I want to do with the bloody Power, not
more. You can blot it right out of your mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the only chance I know, Mat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not for me, it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said firmly. &ldquo;No chance at
all is better than that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite his tone, she wanted to put an arm around
him. Only he would likely make some joke at her expense, and try to
goose her. He had been incorrigible from the day he was born. But
he had come to her for help. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Mat. What will you
do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, play cards, I suppose. If anyone will play with
me. Play stones with Thom. Dice in the taverns. I can still go as
far as the city, at least.&rdquo; His gaze strayed toward a passing
maidservant, a slender, dark-eyed girl, near his own age. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
find something to take up time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her hand itched to slap him, but instead she said
cautiously, &ldquo;Mat, you really aren&rsquo;t thinking of leaving, are
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you tell Moiraine, if I was?&rdquo; He put up his
hands to forestall her. &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no need. I told you I
wouldn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll not pretend I&rsquo;d not like to, but I won&rsquo;t. Is that
good enough for you?&rdquo; A pensive frown crept onto his face. &ldquo;Egwene,
do you ever wish you were back home? That none of this had ever
happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a startling question, coming from him, but she
knew her answer. &ldquo;No. Even with everything, no. Do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would be a fool then, wouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; he laughed.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s cities I like, and this one will do for now. This one will
do. Egwene, you won&rsquo;t tell Moiraine about this, will you? About me
asking for advice and all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; she asked suspiciously. He was
Mat, after all.</p>

<p>He gave an embarrassed hitch of his shoulders. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been keeping wider of her than I have of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Anyway, I&rsquo;ve been
staying clear, especially when she wants to root around in my head.
She might think I&rsquo;m weakening. You won&rsquo;t tell her, will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you promise me you will not
go near that <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> without asking her permission. I
shouldn&rsquo;t even have told you about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promise.&rdquo; He grinned. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go near that thing
unless my life depends on it. I swear.&rdquo; He finished with mock
solemnity.</p>

<p>Egwene shook her head. However much everything else
changed, Mat just never would.</p>
