<h4><em>Questioners</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>hey
should be back by now.&rdquo; Egwene fluttered the
painted silk fan vigorously, glad the nights were at least a little
cooler than the days. Tairen women carried the fans all the time&mdash;the nobles, at least, and the wealthy&mdash;but as far as
she could see they did no good at all except when the sun was down,
and not much then. Even the lamps, great golden, mirrored things on
silvered wall brackets, seemed to add to the heat. &ldquo;What can be
keeping them?&rdquo; An hour, Moiraine had promised them, for the first
time in days, and then she had left without explanation after a
bare five minutes. &ldquo;Did she give any hint of why they wanted her,
Aviendha? Or who wanted her, for that matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seated cross-legged on the floor beside the door,
large green eyes startling in her dark tanned face, the Aiel woman
shrugged. In coat and breeches and soft boots, <em>shoufa</em>
looped about her neck, she appeared unarmed. &ldquo;Careen whispered her
message to Moiraine Sedai. It would not have been proper to listen.
I am sorry, Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Guiltily, Egwene fingered the Great Serpent ring on
her right hand, the golden serpent biting its own tail. As an
Accepted, she should have been wearing it on the third finger of
her left hand, but letting the High Lords believe that they had
four full Aes Sedai inside the Stone kept them on their best
manners, or what passed for manners among Tairen nobles. Moiraine
did not lie, of course; she never said they were more than
Accepted. But she never said they <em>were</em> Accepted, either,
and let everyone think what they wanted to think, believe what they
thought they saw. Moiraine could not lie, but she could make truth
dance a fine jig.</p>

<p>It was not the first time Egwene and the others had
pretended to full sisterhood since leaving the Tower, but more and
more she felt uncomfortable deceiving Aviendha. She liked the Aiel
woman, thought they could be friends if they could ever come to
know one another; but that hardly seemed possible as long as
Aviendha thought Egwene was Aes Sedai. The Aiel woman was there
only at Moiraine&rsquo;s order, issued for unspoken purposes of her own.
Egwene suspected it was to give them an Aiel bodyguard, as if they
had not learned to protect themselves. Still, even if she and
Aviendha did become friends, she could not tell her the truth. The
best way to keep a secret was to make sure no one knew who did not
absolutely have to know. Another point Moiraine had made. Sometimes
Egwene found herself wishing the Aes Sedai could be wrong, glaring
wrong, just once. In a way that would not mean disaster, of course.
That was the rub.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tanchico,&rdquo; Nynaeve muttered. Her dark, wrist-thick
braid hung down her back to her waist as she stared out of one of
the narrow windows, casements swung out in the hope of catching a
night breeze. On the broad River Erinin below bobbed the lanterns
of a few fishing boats that had not ventured down river, but Egwene
doubted she saw them. &ldquo;There is nothing for it but to go to
Tanchico, it seems.&rdquo; Nynaeve gave an unconscious hitch to her green
dress, with its wide neck that bared her shoulders; she did that a
good deal. She would have denied wearing the dress for Lan,
Moiraine&rsquo;s Warder&mdash;she would have if Egwene had dared make
the suggestion&mdash;but green, blue and white seemed to be Lan&rsquo;s
favorite colors on women, and every dress that was not green, blue
or white had vanished from Nynaeve&rsquo;s wardrobe. &ldquo;Nothing for it.&rdquo;
She did not sound happy.</p>

<p>Egwene caught herself giving an upward tug to her own
dress. They felt odd, these dresses that just clung to the
shoulders. On the other hand, she did not believe she could bear to
be more covered. Light as it was, the pale red linen felt like
wool. She wished she could bring herself to wear the filmy gowns
Berelain wore. Not that they were suitable for public eyes, but
they certainly did appear to be cool.</p>

<p><em>Stop fretting over comfort</em>, she told herself
sternly. <em>Keep your mind on the business at hand</em>.
&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she said aloud. &ldquo;Myself, I am not convinced.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A long, narrow table, polished till it glistened, ran
down the middle of the room. A tall chair stood at the end near
Egwene, lightly carved and touched here and there with gilt, quite
plain for Tear, while the sidechairs had progressively lower backs,
until those at the far end seemed little more than benches. Egwene
had no idea what purpose the Tairens had put the room to. She and
the others used it for questioning two prisoners taken when the
Stone fell.</p>

<p>She could not force herself to go into the dungeons,
though Rand had ordered all of the implements that had decorated
the guardroom walls melted or burned. Neither Nynaeve nor Elayne
had been eager to return, either. Besides, this brightly lit room,
with its clean-swept green tile floor and its wall panels carved
with the Three Crescents of Tear, was a sharp contrast to the grim,
gray stone of the cells, all dim and dank and dirty. That had to
have some softening effect on the two women in prisoners&rsquo;
rough-woven woolens.</p>

<p>Only that drab brown dress, however, would have told
most people that Joiya Byir, standing beyond the table with her
back turned, was a prisoner at all. She had been Gray Ajah, and had
lost none of the Grays&rsquo; cool self-possession on shifting her
allegiance to the Black. Every line of her proclaimed that she
stared rigidly at the far wall of her own choice, and for no other
reason. Only a woman who could channel would have seen the
thumb-thick flows of Air that held Joiya&rsquo;s arms to her sides and
lashed her ankles together. A cage woven of Air kept her eyes
straight ahead. Even her ears were stopped up, so she could not
hear what anyone said until they wanted her to.</p>

<p>Once again Egwene checked the shield woven from
Spirit that blocked Joiya from touching the True Source. It held,
as she knew it must. She herself had woven all the flows around
Joiya and tied them to maintain themselves, but she could not be
easy in the same room with a Darkfriend who had the ability to
channel, even if it was blocked. Worse than just a Darkfriend.
Black Ajah. Murder was the least of Joiya&rsquo;s crimes. She should have
been bowed down under her weight of broken oaths, blasted lives and
blighted souls.</p>

<p>Joiya&rsquo;s fellow prisoner, her sister in the Black
Ajah, lacked her strength. Standing stoop-shouldered at the far end
of the table, head down, Amico Nagoyin seemed to sink in on herself
under Egwene&rsquo;s gaze. There was no need to shield her. Amico had
been stilled during her capture. Still able to sense the True
Source, she would never again touch it, never again channel. The
desire to, the need to, would remain, as sharp as the need to
breathe, and her loss would be there for as long as she lived, <em>
saidar</em> forever out of reach. Egwene wished she could find in
herself even a shred of pity. But she did not wish for it very
hard.</p>

<p>Amico murmured something at the tabletop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Nynaeve demanded. &ldquo;Speak up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amico raised her face humbly on its slender neck. She
was still a beautiful woman, with large, dark eyes, but there was
something different about her that Egwene could not quite put her
finger on. Not the fear that made her clutch her coarse prisoner&rsquo;s
dress with both hands. Something else.</p>

<p>Swallowing, Amico said, &ldquo;You should go to
Tanchico.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve told us that twenty times,&rdquo; Nynaeve said
roughly. &ldquo;Fifty times. Tell us something new. Name names we do not
already know. Who still in the White Tower is Black Ajah?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know. You must believe me.&rdquo; Amico sounded
tired, utterly beaten. Not at all the way she had sounded when they
were the prisoners and she the gaoler. &ldquo;Before we left the Tower, I
knew only Liandrin, Chesmal and Rianna. No one knew more than two
or three others, I think. Except Liandrin. I have told you
everything I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you are remarkably ignorant for a woman who
expected to rule part of the world when the Dark One breaks free,&rdquo;
Egwene said dryly, snapping her fan shut for emphasis. It still
stunned her, how easily she could say that now. Her stomach still
clenched, and icy fingers still crawled her spine, but she no
longer wanted to scream, or run weeping. It was possible to become
used to anything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I overheard Liandrin that once, talking to Temaile,&rdquo;
Amico said wearily, starting a tale she had told them many times.
In the first days of her captivity she had tried to improve her
story, but the more she elaborated the more she had tangled herself
in her own lies. Now she almost always told it the same way, word
for word. &ldquo;If you could have seen Liandrin&rsquo;s face when she saw me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She would have murdered me on the spot had she thought I had
heard anything. And Temaile likes to hurt people. She enjoys it. I
only heard a little before they saw me. Liandrin said there was
something in Tanchico, something dangerous to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to him.&rdquo; She
meant Rand. She could not say his name, and a mention of the Dragon
Reborn was enough to send her into tears. &ldquo;Liandrin said it was
dangerous to whoever used it, too. Almost as dangerous as to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;him. That is why she had not already gone after it. And she said
being able to channel would not protect him. She said, &lsquo;When
we find it, his filthy ability will bind him for us.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; Sweat ran
down her face, but she shivered almost uncontrollably.</p>

<p>Not a word had changed.</p>

<p>Egwene opened her mouth, but Nynaeve spoke first.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard enough of this. Let us see if the other has anything
new to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene glared at her, and Nynaeve stared back just as
hard, neither blinking. <em>Sometimes she thinks she&rsquo;s still the
Wisdom</em>, Egwene thought grimly, <em>and I&rsquo;m still the village
girl to teach about herbs. She had better realize things are
different now</em>. Nynaeve was strong in the Power, stronger than
Egwene, but only when she could actually manage to channel; unless
angry, Nynaeve could not channel at all.</p>

<p>Elayne usually smoothed things over when it came to
this, as it did more often than it should. By the time Egwene
thought of smoothing matters herself, she had almost always dug in
her heels and flared back, and trying to be soothing then would
only be backing down. That was how Nynaeve would see it, she was
sure. She could not remember Nynaeve ever making any move to back
down, so why should she? This time Elayne was not there; Moiraine
had summoned the Daughter-Heir with a word and a gesture to follow
the Maiden who had come for the Aes Sedai. Without her, the tension
stretched, each of the Accepted waiting for the other to blink
first. Aviendha barely breathed; she kept herself strictly out of
their confrontations. No doubt she considered it simple wisdom to
stand clear.</p>

<p>Strangely, it was Amico who broke the impasse this
time, though likely all she meant to do was demonstrate her
cooperation. She turned to face the far wall, waiting patiently to
be bound.</p>

<p>The foolishness of it struck Egwene suddenly. She was
the only woman in the room who could channel&mdash;unless Nynaeve
grew angry, or Joiya&rsquo;s shield failed; she tested the weave of
Spirit again without thinking&mdash;and she indulged in a staring
match while Amico waited to accept her bonds. At another time she
might have laughed at herself aloud. Instead, she opened herself to
<em>saidar</em>, that never-seen, ever-felt glowing warmth that
seemed always to be just beyond the corner of her eye. The One
Power filled her, like joyous life itself redoubled, and she wove
the flows around Amico.</p>

<p>Nynaeve merely grunted; it was doubtful she was mad
enough to sense what Egwene was doing&mdash;she could not, without
her temper up&mdash;yet she could see Amico stiffen as the flows
of Air touched her, then slump, half supported by the flows, as if
to show how little she was resisting.</p>

<p>Aviendha shuddered, the way she had taken to doing
whenever she knew the Power was being channeled near her.</p>

<p>Egwene wove blocks for Amico&rsquo;s ears&mdash;questioning them one at a time did little good if they could hear
each other&rsquo;s stories&mdash;and turned to Joiya. She shifted her
fan from hand to hand so she could wipe them on her dress, and
stopped with a grimace of distaste. Her sweaty palms had nothing to
do with the temperature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her face,&rdquo; Aviendha said abruptly. And surprisingly;
she almost never spoke unless addressed by Moiraine or one of the
others. &ldquo;Amico&rsquo;s face. She does not have the look she did, as if
the years had passed her by. Not as much as she did. Is that
because she was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;because she was stilled?&rdquo; she finished in a
breathless rush. She had picked up a few habits being so much
around them. No woman of the Tower could speak of stilling without
a chill.</p>

<p>Egwene moved down the table, to where she could see
Amico&rsquo;s face from the side and yet stay out of Joiya&rsquo;s vision.
Joiya&rsquo;s eyes always turned her stomach to a lump of ice.</p>

<p>Aviendha was right; that was the difference she
herself had noticed and not understood. Amico looked young, perhaps
younger than her years, but it was not quite the agelessness of
Aes Sedai who had worked years with the One Power. &ldquo;You have sharp
eyes, Aviendha, but I don&rsquo;t know if this has anything to do with
stilling. It must, though, I suppose. I don&rsquo;t know what else could
cause it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She realized that did not sound very much like an Aes
Sedai, who generally spoke as if they knew everything; when an Aes
Sedai said she did not know, she usually managed to make her denial
appear to cloak volumes of knowledge. While she was racking her
brain for something properly portentous, Nynaeve came to her
rescue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Relatively few Aes Sedai have ever been burned out,
Aviendha, and far fewer stilled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burned out&rdquo; was what it was called when it happened
by accident; officially, stilling resulted from trial and sentence.
Egwene could not see the point of it, really; it was like having
two words for falling down the stairs, depending on whether you
tripped or were pushed. For that, most Aes Sedai seemed to see it
the same, except when teaching novices or Accepted. Three words,
actually. Men were &ldquo;gentled,&rdquo; must be gentled, before they went
mad. Only now there was Rand, and the Tower did not dare gentle
him.</p>

<p>Nynaeve had put on a lecturing tone, no doubt trying
to sound Aes Sedai. She was doing an imitation of Sheriam before a
class, Egwene realized, hands clasped at her waist, smiling
slightly as if it were all so simple when you applied yourself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stilling is not a thing anyone would choose to
study, you understand,&rdquo; Nynaeve continued. &ldquo;It is generally
accepted to be irreversible. What makes a woman able to channel
cannot be replaced once it is removed, any more than a hand that
has been cut off can be Healed back into existence.&rdquo; At least, no
one had ever been able to Heal stilling. There had been attempts.
What Nynaeve said was generally true, yet some sisters of the Brown
Ajah would study almost anything if given the chance, and some
Yellow sisters, the best Healers, would try to learn to Heal
anything. But even a hint of success at Healing a woman who had
been stilled was nonexistent. &ldquo;Aside from that one hard fact,
little is known. Women who are stilled seldom live more than a few
years. They seem to stop wanting to live; they give up. As I said,
it is an unpleasant subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha shifted uncomfortably. &ldquo;I only thought that
might be it,&rdquo; she said in a low voice.</p>

<p>Egwene thought it might be, too. She resolved to ask
Moiraine. If she ever saw her without Aviendha there as well. It
seemed to her that their deceit got in the way almost as much as it
helped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us see if Joiya still tells the same tale, too.&rdquo;
Even so, she had to take herself in hand before she could unravel
the flows of Air woven around the Darkfriend.</p>

<p>Joiya must have been stiff from standing so still for
so long, but she turned smoothly to face them. The sweat beading
her forehead could not diminish her dignity and presence, any more
than her drab, rough dress lessened the sense of her being there by
choice. She was a handsome woman with something motherly about her
face despite its ageless smoothness, something comforting. But the
dark eyes set in that face made a hawk&rsquo;s look kind. She smiled at
them, a smile that never reached those eyes. &ldquo;The Light illumine
you. May the hand of the Creator shelter you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not hear that out of you.&rdquo; Nynaeve&rsquo;s voice
was quiet and calm, but she tossed her braid over her shoulder and
gripped the end in her fist, the way she did when angry or uneasy.
Egwene did not think she was uneasy; Joiya did not seem to make
Nynaeve&rsquo;s skin crawl as she did Egwene&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have repented my sins,&rdquo; Joiya said smoothly. &ldquo;The
Dragon is Reborn, and he holds <em>Callandor</em>. The Prophecies
are fulfilled. The Dark One must fail. I can see that, now. My
repentance is real. No one can walk so long in the Shadow that she
cannot come again to the Light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s face had grown darker by the word. Egwene
was sure she was furious enough to channel now, but if she did it
would probably be to strangle Joiya. Egwene did not believe Joiya&rsquo;s
repentance any more than Nynaeve, of course, but the woman&rsquo;s
information might be real. Joiya was quite capable of a cold
decision to go over to what she believed would be the winning side.
Or she might only be buying time, lying in hope of rescue.</p>

<p>Lies should not have been possible for an Aes Sedai,
even one who had lost all right to the name, not outright lies. The
very first of the Three Oaths, taken with the Oath Rod in hand,
should have seen to that. But whatever oaths to the Dark One were
sworn on joining the Black Ajah, they seemed to sever all Three
Oaths.</p>

<p>Well. The Amyrlin had sent them out to hunt the Black
Ajah, to hunt Liandrin and the other twelve who had done murder and
fled the Tower. And all they had to go on now was what these two
could, or would, tell them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give us your tale again,&rdquo; Egwene commanded. &ldquo;Use
different words, this time. I am tired of listening to memorized
stories.&rdquo; If she was lying, there was more chance she would trip
herself up telling it differently. &ldquo;We will hear you out.&rdquo; That was
for Nynaeve&rsquo;s benefit; she gave a loud sniff, then a curt nod.</p>

<p>Joiya shrugged. &ldquo;As you wish. Let me see. Different
words. The false Dragon, Mazrim Taim, who was captured in Saldaea,
can channel with incredible strength. Perhaps as much as Rand
al&rsquo;Thor, or nearly so, if the reports can be believed. Before he
can be brought to Tar Valon and gentled, Liandrin means to break
him free. He will be proclaimed as the Dragon Reborn, his name
given as Rand al&rsquo;Thor, and then he will be set to destruction on
such a scale as the world has not seen since the War of the Hundred
Years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is impossible,&rdquo; Nynaeve broke in. &ldquo;The Pattern
will not accept a false Dragon, not now that Rand has proclaimed
himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene sighed. They had had this out before, but
Nynaeve always argued the point. She was not sure Nynaeve really
believed that Rand was the Dragon Reborn, no matter what she said,
no matter the Prophecies and <em>Callandor</em> and the fall of the
Stone. Nynaeve was just enough older than he to have looked after
him when he was a child, just as she had after Egwene. He was an
Emond&rsquo;s Fielder, and Nynaeve still saw her first duty as protecting
the people of Emond&rsquo;s Field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that what Moiraine told you?&rdquo; Joiya asked with a
touch of contempt. &ldquo;Moiraine has spent little time in the Tower
since she was raised, and not much more with her sisters anywhere.
I suppose she knows the workings of village life, perhaps even
something of the politics between nations, but she does claim
certainty about matters learned only through study and discussion
with those who know. Still, she might be correct. Mazrim Taim might
well find it impossible to proclaim himself. But if others do it
for him, is there a difference that matters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene wished Moiraine would come back. The woman
would not speak so confidently if Moiraine were there. Joiya knew
very well that she and Nynaeve were only Accepted. It made a
difference.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; Egwene said, almost as harshly as Nynaeve.
&ldquo;And remember, different words.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Joiya replied, as though responding to a
gracious invitation, but her eyes glittered like chips of black
glass. &ldquo;You can see the obvious result. Rand al&rsquo;Thor will be blamed
for the depredations of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Rand al&rsquo;Thor. Even proof that they are
not the same man may well be dismissed. After all, who can say what
tricks the Dragon Reborn can play? Perhaps put himself in two
places at once. Even the sort who have always rallied to a false
Dragon will hesitate in the face of the indiscriminate slaughter
and worse laid at his feet. Those who do not shrink at such
butchery will seek out the Rand al&rsquo;Thor who seems to revel in
blood. The nations will unite as they did in the Aiel War&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;
She gave Aviendha an apologetic smile, incongruous beneath those
merciless eyes. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but no doubt much more quickly. Even the
Dragon Reborn cannot stand against that, not forever. He will be
crushed before the Last Battle even begins, by the very ones he was
meant to save. The Dark One will break free, the day of Tarmon
Gai&rsquo;don will come, and the Shadow will cover the earth and remake
the Pattern for all time. That is Liandrin&rsquo;s plan.&rdquo; There was not a
hint of satisfaction in her voice, but no horror, either.</p>

<p>It was a plausible story, more plausible than Amico&rsquo;s
tale of a few eavesdropped sentences, but Egwene believed Amico and
not Joiya. Perhaps because she wanted to. A vague threat in
Tanchico was easier to face than this fully fleshed plan to turn
every hand against Rand. <em>No</em>, she thought. <em>Joiya</em>
is <em>lying. I am sure she is</em>. Yet they could not afford to
ignore either story. But they could not chase after both, not with
any hope of success.</p>

<p>The door banged open, and Moiraine strode in, with
Elayne following. The Daughter-Heir was frowning at the floor in
front of her toes, lost in dark thoughts, but Moiraine&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;For
once the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s serenity had vanished; fury painted her
face.</p>
