<h4><em>Sharp Lessons</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
Heart of the Stone in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> was
as Egwene remembered it in the real world, huge polished redstone
columns rising to a distant ceiling, and, beneath the great central
dome, <em>Callandor</em> driven into the pale floorstones. Only
people were missing. The golden lamps were not lit, yet there was a
sort of light, somehow dim and sharp at the same time, that seemed
to come from everywhere at once, or nowhere. It was often like
that, indoors in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>.</p>

<p>What she did not expect was the woman standing beyond
the glittering crystal sword and peering off into the pallid
shadows among the columns. The way she was dressed startled Egwene.
Bare feet, and wide trousers of brocaded yellow silk. Above a
darker yellow sash, she was quite bare except for golden chains
hanging around her neck. Tiny gold rings decorated her ears in
sparkling rows, and most startling of all, another pierced her
nose, with a thin, medallion-lined chain running from nose ring to
one of the rings in her left ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elayne?&rdquo; Egwene gasped, gathering her shawl around
her as though she were the one with no blouse. She had garbed
herself as a Wise One, this time, for no particular reason.</p>

<p>The Daughter-Heir leaped, and when she came down
facing Egwene she was wearing a demure gown of pale green with a
high, embroidered neck and long sleeves that dangled points over
her hands. No earrings. No nose ring. &ldquo;It is how the Sea Folk women
dress at sea,&rdquo; she said hurriedly, with a furious blush. &ldquo;I wanted
to see how it felt, and this seemed the best place. I couldn&rsquo;t do
it on the ship, after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How does it feel?&rdquo; Egwene asked curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cold, actually.&rdquo; Elayne looked around at the
surrounding columns. &ldquo;And it makes you feel people are staring at
you, even when there&rsquo;s no one there.&rdquo; Abruptly she laughed. &ldquo;Poor
Thom and Juilin. They do not know where to look most of the time.
Half the crew are women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Studying the columns herself, Egwene shrugged
uncomfortably. It did feel as if they were being watched. No doubt
it was just because they were the only people in the Stone. No one
who had access to <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> could expect to find
anyone to watch, here. &ldquo;Thom? Thom Merrilin? And Juilin Sandar? Are
<em>they</em> with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Egwene, Rand sent them. Rand and Lan. Well,
Moiraine sent Thom, actually, but Rand sent Master Sandar. To help
us. Nynaeve is quite set up about it, about Lan, though of course
she won&rsquo;t let on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene smothered a small smile. <em>Nynaeve</em> was
set up? Elayne&rsquo;s face was beaming, and her dress had changed again,
to a <em>much</em> lower neckline, apparently without her realizing
it. The <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, the twisted stone ring, helped the
Daughter Heir reach the World of Dreams as easily as Egwene did,
but it did not confer control. That had to be learned. Stray
thoughts&mdash;such as how she might like to look for Rand&mdash;could still alter things for Elayne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is he?&rdquo; Elayne&rsquo;s voice was a strange blend of
forced casualness and apprehension.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Egwene said. &ldquo;I think he is.&rdquo; She made it a
full report. The Portal Stones, and Rhuidean&mdash;as much as she
knew from what she had heard; what she had managed to infer from
talk of seeing through ancestors&rsquo; eyes&mdash;the strange creature
from the Dragon banner marked on Rand&rsquo;s forearms, Bair&rsquo;s revelation
that he was the Aiel&rsquo;s doom, the summons of the clan chiefs to
Alcair Dal. Amys and the other Wise Ones should be doing that even
now; she fervently hoped they were. She even told the strange story
of Rand&rsquo;s true parents, in a shorter form. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, though.
He has been acting stranger than ever, since, and Mat hardly less.
I don&rsquo;t mean that he&rsquo;s mad, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He is as hard as Rhuarc or
Lan, in some ways at least; maybe harder. He&rsquo;s planning something,
I think&mdash;something he doesn&rsquo;t mean anybody to know&mdash;and
he is in a rush to get to it. It is worrying. Sometimes I have the
feeling he doesn&rsquo;t see people anymore, only pieces on a stones
board.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne did not look worried, or not about that, at
any rate. &ldquo;He is what he is, Egwene. A king, or a general, cannot
always afford to see people. When a ruler has to do what is right
for a nation, there are times when some will be hurt by what is
best for the whole. Rand <em>is</em> a king, Egwene, even if without a
nation unless you count Tear, and if he won&rsquo;t do anything that will
hurt anyone, he will end by hurting everyone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene sniffed. It might make sense, but she did not
have to like it. People were people, and they had to be seen as
people. &ldquo;There is more. Some of the Wise Ones can channel. I don&rsquo;t
know how many, but I suspect more than a few, to some degree. From
what Amys tells me, they find every last woman who has the spark
born in her.&rdquo; No Aiel women died trying to teach themselves to
channel while not even knowing what they were trying to do; there
was no such thing as a wilder among the Aiel. Men who learned they
could channel faced a grimmer fate; they went north, to the Great
Blight and maybe beyond, to the Blasted Lands and Shayol Ghul.
&ldquo;Going to kill the Dark One,&rdquo; they called it. None survived long
enough to face madness. &ldquo;Aviendha is one with the spark, it turns
out. She&rsquo;ll be very strong, I think. Amys thinks so, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aviendha,&rdquo; Elayne said wonderingly. &ldquo;Of course. I
should have known. I felt the same kinship for Jorin on first sight
that I did for her. And for you, for that matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jorin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne grimaced. &ldquo;I promised I would keep her secret,
and the first chance I get, I let my tongue run wild. Well, I don&rsquo;t
suppose you will harm her or her sisters. Jorin is Windfinder on
<em>Wavedancer</em>, Egwene. She can channel, and so can some of
the other Windfinders.&rdquo; She glanced at the columns around them,
and her neckline was suddenly back up under her chin. She adjusted
a dark lace shawl that had not been there a moment before, covering
her hair and shadowing her face. &ldquo;Egwene, you mustn&rsquo;t tell anyone.
Jorin is afraid the Tower will try to force them to become Aes
Sedai, or try to control them in some fashion. I promised I would
do what I can not to let that happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; Egwene said slowly. Wise Ones and
Windfinders. Women able to channel among both, and none who had
taken the Three Oaths, bound by the Oath Rod. The Oaths were
supposed to make people trust Aes Sedai, or at least not fear their
power, but Aes Sedai still had to move in secret as often as not.
Wise Ones&mdash;and Windfinders, she was willing to wager&mdash;had honored
places in their societies. Without being bound to supposedly make
them safe. It was something to think on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve and I are ahead of schedule, too, Egwene.
Jorin has been teaching me to work the weather&mdash;you would
not believe the size of the flows of Air she can weave!&mdash;and
between us, we&rsquo;ve had <em>Wavedancer</em> moving as fast as he ever
has, and that is <em>fast</em>. We should be in Tanchico in another
three days, maybe two, according to Coine. She&rsquo;s the Sailmistress,
the captain. Ten days from Tear to Tanchico, perhaps. That is with
stopping to talk with every Atha&rsquo;an Miere ship we see. Egwene, the
Sea Folk think Rand is their Coramoor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coine has some of what happened in Tear wrong&mdash;she assumes the Aes Sedai serve Rand now, for one thing; Nynaeve
and I thought it best not to put her straight about that&mdash;but
as soon as she tells another Sailmistress, they&rsquo;re all ready to
spread the word and serve Rand. I believe they will do anything he
asks of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish the Aiel were so accepting,&rdquo; Egwene sighed.
&ldquo;Rhuarc thinks some of them might refuse to acknowledge him,
Rhuidean Dragons or no. One fellow, a man called Couladin, I&rsquo;m sure
would kill him in a minute given half a chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne took a step forward. &ldquo;You will see that
doesn&rsquo;t happen.&rdquo; It was not a question or a request. There was a
sharp light in her blue eyes, and a bared dagger in her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do the best I can. Rhuarc is giving him
bodyguards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne seemed to see the dagger for the first time,
and gave a start. The blade vanished. &ldquo;You must teach me whatever
Amys is teaching you, Egwene. It is disconcerting to have things
appear and disappear, or suddenly realize I&rsquo;m wearing different
clothes. It just happens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will. When I have time.&rdquo; She had been in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> too long already. &ldquo;Elayne, if I am not here
when we are supposed to meet next, don&rsquo;t worry. I will try, but I
may not be able to come. Be sure to tell Nynaeve. If I do not come,
check every night thereafter. I won&rsquo;t be more than one or two late,
I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you say so,&rdquo; Elayne said doubtfully. &ldquo;It will
surely take weeks to find out if Liandrin and the others are in
Tanchico or not. Thom seems to think the city will be very
confused.&rdquo; Her eyes went to <em>Callandor</em>, driven half its
length into the floor. &ldquo;Why did he do that, do you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said it will hold the Tairens to him. As long as
they know it&rsquo;s there, they have to know he is coming back. Maybe he
knows what he is talking about. I hope so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh. I thought&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;perhaps he&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;was angry about&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene frowned at her. This sudden diffidence was not
like Elayne at all. &ldquo;Angry about what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing. It was just a thought. Egwene, I gave
him two letters before leaving Tear. Do you know how he took
them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. Did you say something you think might
have angered him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo; Elayne laughed gaily; it sounded
forced. Her dress was suddenly dark wool, stout enough for a hard
winter. &ldquo;I would have to be a fool to write things to make him
angry.&rdquo; Her hair sprang up in all directions, like a crazed crown.
She was not aware of it. &ldquo;I am trying to make him love me, after
all. Just trying to make him love me. Oh, why can&rsquo;t men be simple?
Why do they have to cause such difficulties? At least he&rsquo;s away
from Berelain.&rdquo; The wool became silk again, cut even lower than
before; her hair made shimmers on her shoulders to shame the gown&rsquo;s
sheen. She hesitated, nibbling her lower lip. &ldquo;Egwene? If you find
the chance, would you tell him I meant what I said in&mdash;Egwene? Egwene!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something snatched Egwene. The Heart of the Stone
dwindled into blackness as if she were being hauled away by the
scruff of her neck.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">With a gasp, Egwene started awake, heart pounding,
staring up the low roof of the night-darkened tent over her head.
Only a little moonlight crept in at the open sides. She lay under
her blankets&mdash;the Waste was as cold at night as it was hot
during the day, and the brazier that exuded the sweetish smell of
dried dung burning gave little warmth&mdash;beneath her blankets
right where she had lain down to sleep. But&mdash;what had pulled
her back?</p>

<p>Abruptly she became aware of Amys, sitting
cross-legged beside her, cloaked in shadows. The Wise One&rsquo;s
murk-shrouded face seemed as dark and foreboding as the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you do that, Amys?&rdquo; she said angrily. &ldquo;You have
no right to just haul me about. I am Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; The lie came easily to her lips now &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and you have no
right&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amys cut her off With a grim voice. &ldquo;Beyond the
Dragonwall, in the White Tower, you are Aes Sedai. Here, you are an
ignorant pupil, a fool child crawling through a den of vipers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know I said I would not go to <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> without you,&rdquo; Egwene said, trying to sound
reasonable, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something seized her ankles, hauled her feet into the
air; blankets tumbled away, her shift dropped to bunch in her
armpits. Upside down, she hung with her face level with that of
Amys. Furious, she opened herself to <em>saidar</em>&mdash;and
found herself blocked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wanted to go off alone,&rdquo; Amys hissed softly.
&ldquo;You were warned, but you had to go.&rdquo; Her eyes seemed to glow in
the dark, brighter and brighter. &ldquo;Never a care for what might be
waiting. There are things in dreams to shatter the bravest heart.&rdquo;
Around eyes like blue coals, her face melted, stretched. Scales
sprouted where skin had been; her jaws thrust out, lined with sharp
teeth. &ldquo;Things to <em>eat</em> the bravest heart,&rdquo; she growled.</p>

<p>Screaming, Egwene battered vainly at the shield
holding her from the True Source. She tried to beat at that
horrible face, at the thing that could not be Amys, but something
gripped her wrists, stretched her taut and quivering in midair. All
she could do was shriek as those jaws closed around her face.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Screaming, Egwene sat up, clutching at her blankets.
With an effort she managed to snap her mouth shut, but she could do
nothing about the shudders that racked her. She was in the tent&mdash;or was she? There was Amys, cross-legged in the shadows,
glowing with <em>saidar</em>&mdash;or was it she? Desperately, she
opened herself to the Source, and nearly howled when she found the
barrier again. Tossing the blankets aside, she scrambled across the
layered rugs on bands and knees, scattered her neatly folded
clothes with both hands. She had a belt knife. Where was it? Where?
There!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; Amys said acerbically, &ldquo;before I dose
you for vapors and fidgets. You will not like the taste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene twisted around on her knees, the short knife
held in both hands; they would have trembled if not clutched
together around the hilt. &ldquo;Is it really you this time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am myself, now and also then. Sharp lessons are
the best lessons. Do you mean to stab me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hesitating, Egwene sheathed the knife. &ldquo;You have no
right to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have every right! You gave me your word. I did not
know Aes Sedai could lie. If I am to teach you, I must know you
will do as I say. I will not watch a pupil of mine cut her own
throat!&rdquo; Amys sighed; the glow around her vanished, and so did the
barrier between Egwene and <em>saidar</em>. &ldquo;I cannot shield you
any longer. You are far stronger than I. In the One Power, you are.
You very nearly battered down my shield. But if you cannot keep
your word, I do not know that I want to instruct you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will keep my word, Amys. I promise I will. But I
have to meet with my friends, in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. I
promised them, too. Amys, they might need my help, my advice.&rdquo;
Amys&rsquo;s face was not easy to make out in the darkness, but Egwene
did not see any softening. &ldquo;Please, Amys. You&rsquo;ve taught me so much
already. I think I could find them wherever they are, now. Please,
don&rsquo;t stop when there is so much yet for me to learn. Whatever you
want me to do, I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Braid your hair,&rdquo; Amys said in a flat tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My hair?&rdquo; Egwene said uncertainly. It would
certainly be no inconvenience, but why? She wore it loose now,
falling below her shoulders, yet it was not that long ago that she
had almost burst with pride on the day the Women&rsquo;s Circle back home
had said she was old enough to put her hair in a braid like the one
Nynaeve still wore. In the Two Rivers, a braid said you were old
enough to be considered a woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One over each ear.&rdquo; Amys&rsquo;s voice was still like a
flat rock. &ldquo;If you have no ribbon to twine in the braids, I will
give you some. That is how little girls wear their hair among us.
Girls too young to be held to their word. When you prove to me that
you can keep yours, you can stop wearing it so. But if you lie to
me again, I will make you cut your skirts off short, like little
girls&rsquo; dresses, and find you a doll to carry. When you decide to
behave as a woman, you will be treated as a woman. Agree to it, or
I will teach you no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will agree if you will accompany me when I must
meet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Agree, <em>Aes Sedai</em>! I do not bargain with
children, or those who cannot keep their word. You will do as I
say, accept what I choose to give, and no more. Or else go off and
get yourself killed on your own. I&mdash;will&mdash;not&mdash;aid it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene was glad of the dark; it hid her scowl. She
<em>had</em> given her word, but this was all so unfair. No one was
trying to hedge Rand around with silly rules. Well, perhaps he <em>
was</em> different. She was not sure she wanted to trade Amys&rsquo;s
edicts for Couladin&rsquo;s desiring to put a spear through her, in any,
case. Mat would certainly not put up with other people&rsquo;s rules. Yet
<em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> or not, Mat had nothing to learn; all he had to
do was be. Very likely he would refuse to learn anything given the
chance, unless it had to do with gambling or raising fool. She
wanted to learn. Sometimes it seemed an unending thirst; however
much she absorbed, she could not quench it. That still did not make
it fair. <em>Only the way things are</em>, she thought
ruefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I agree,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I will do as you say, accept
what you give, and no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; After a long pause, as if waiting to see
whether Egwene wanted to say more&mdash;she wisely held her tongue&mdash;Amys added, &ldquo;I mean to be hard on you, Egwene, but not
without purpose. That you think I have taught you much already only
shows how little you knew to begin. You have a strong talent for
the dream; very likely you will outstrip any of us by far, one day.
But if you do not learn what I can teach you&mdash;what we four
can all teach you&mdash;you will never develop that talent fully.
It is most likely you will not live long enough to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will try, Amys.&rdquo; She thought she managed a good
approximation of meekness. Why did the woman not say what she
wanted to hear? If Egwene could not go to <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>
alone, then Amys had to come, too, when she next met Elayne. Or it
might be Nynaeve, next time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good. Do you have anything else to say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Amys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pause was longer this time; Egwene waited as
patiently as she could, hands folded on her knees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you can hold your demands inside when you wish,&rdquo;
Amys said at last, &ldquo;even if it does make you twitch like a goat
with the itch. Do I mistake the cause? I can give you an ointment.
No? Very well. I will accompany you when you must meet your
friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Egwene said primly. A goat with an itch
indeed!</p>

<p>&ldquo;In case you did not listen when I first told you,
learning will be neither easy nor short. You think you have worked
these last days. Prepare to give real time and effort now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amys, I will learn as much as you can teach me, and
I will work as hard as you want, but between Rand and the
Darkfriends&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Time to learn may turn out to be a luxury, and my
purse empty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Amys said wearily. &ldquo;He troubles us already.
Come. You have wasted enough time with your childishness. There is
women&rsquo;s business to be discussed. Come. The others are waiting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the first time Egwene realized Moiraine&rsquo;s
blankets were empty. She reached for her dress, but Amys said,
&ldquo;That will not be needed. We only go a short way. Throw a blanket
around your shoulders and come. I have done a great deal of work
for Rand al&rsquo;Thor already, and I must do more when we are
finished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shrugging a blanket around her doubtfully, Egwene
followed the older woman into the night. It was <em>cold</em>. Skin
turning to tight goose bumps, she hopped from bare foot to bare
foot over stony ground that seemed little short of ice. After the
heat of day, the night seemed as frigid as the heart of a Two
Rivers winter. Her breath turned to thin mist in front of her
mouth, absorbed immediately by the air. Cold or not, the air was
still dry.</p>

<p>At the rear of the Wise Ones&rsquo; camp stood a small tent
she had not seen before, low like the others, but staked tightly
down all around. To her surprise, Amys began, stripping off her
clothes, and motioned her to do the same. Clenching her teeth to
keep them from chattering, she followed Amys&rsquo;s example slowly. When
the Aiel woman had shed down to her skin, she stood there just as
if the night were not freezing, taking deep breaths and flailing
herself with her arms before finally ducking inside. Egwene darted
after her with alacrity.</p>

<p>Damp heat hit her like a stick between the eyes.
Sweat popped out of every pore.</p>

<p>Moiraine was already there, and the other Wise Ones,
and Aviendha, all bare-skinned and sweating, sitting around a large
iron kettle full to the brim with sooty stones. Kettle and stones
alike radiated heat. The Aes, Sedai looked mostly recovered from
her ordeal, though there was a tightness around her eyes that had
not been there before.</p>

<p>As Egwene was gingerly finding a place to sit&mdash;no layered rugs here; only rocky ground&mdash;Aviendha scooped a
handful of water from a smaller kettle at her side and tossed it
into the larger one. The water hissed to steam, leaving not even a
damp spot on the stones. Aviendha had a sour look on her face.
Egwene knew how she felt. Novices in the Tower were also given
chores; she was not sure if she had hated scrubbing floors more
than pots or the other way around. This task did not look nearly so
onerous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must discuss what to do about Rand al&rsquo;Thor,&rdquo; Bair
said when Amys was seated, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do about him?&rdquo; Egwene said, alarmed. &ldquo;He has the
signs. He is the one you have been looking for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is the one,&rdquo; Melaine said grimly, brushing long
strands of red-gold hair from her damp face, &ldquo;We must try to see
that as many of our people as possible survive his coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just as importantly,&rdquo; Seana said, &ldquo;we must assure
that he survives to fulfill the rest of the prophecy.&rdquo; Melaine
glared at her, and Seana added in a patient tone, &ldquo;Else none of us
will survive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rhuarc said he would set some of the Jindo for
bodyguards,&rdquo; Egwene said slowly. &ldquo;Has he changed his mind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amys shook her head. &ldquo;He has not. Rand al&rsquo;Thor sleeps
in the Jindo tents, with a hundred men awake to see he wakes as
well. But men often see things differently than we. Rhuarc will
follow him, perhaps oppose him in decisions he thinks are wrong,
but he will not try to guide him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think he needs guiding?&rdquo; Moiraine arched an
eyebrow at that, but Egwene ignored it. &ldquo;He has done what he had to
without guidance so far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand al&rsquo;Thor does not know our ways,&rdquo; Amys replied.
&ldquo;There are a hundred mistakes he could make to turn a chief or clan
against him, to make them see a wetlander instead of He Who Comes
With the Dawn. My husband is a good man and a fine chief, but he is
no peacetalker, trained to guide angry men to ground their spears.
We must have someone close to Rand al&rsquo;Thor who can whisper in his
ear when he seems ready to step wrongly.&rdquo; She motioned Aviendha to
throw more water on the hot rocks; the younger woman complied with
a sullen grace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we must watch him,&rdquo; Melaine put in sharply. &ldquo;We
must have some idea of what he means to do before he does it. The
fulfillment of the Prophecy of Rhuidean has begun&mdash;it cannot
be halted short of its end, one way or another&mdash;but I mean to
see that as many of our people survive as is possible. How that can
be managed depends on what Rand al&rsquo;Thor intends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bair leaned toward Egwene. She seemed to be all bone
and sinew. &ldquo;You have known him from childhood. Will he confide in
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; Egwene told her. &ldquo;He does not trust as
he used to.&rdquo; She avoided looking at Moiraine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would she tell us if he did confide?&rdquo; Melaine
demanded. &ldquo;I raise no anger here, but Egwene and Moiraine are Aes
Sedai. What they seek may not be what we seek.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We served Aes Sedai once,&rdquo; Bair said simply. &ldquo;We
failed them then. Perhaps we are meant to serve again.&rdquo; Melaine
flushed with obvious embarrassment.</p>

<p>Moiraine gave no sign that she saw, or that she had
heard the woman&rsquo;s earlier words, for that matter. Except for that
tightness around her eyes she looked as calm as ice. &ldquo;I will help
as I can,&rdquo; she said coolly, &ldquo;but I have little influence with
Rand. For the present, he weaves the Pattern to his own design.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we must watch him closely and hope.&rdquo; Bair
sighed. &ldquo;Aviendha, you will meet Rand al&rsquo;Thor when he wakes each
day and do not leave him until he goes to his blankets at night.
You will stay as close to him as the hair on his head. Your
training must come as we can manage, I fear; it will be a burden on
you, doing both things, but it cannot be avoided. If you talk to
him&mdash;and especially listen&mdash;you should have no trouble
remaining near him. Few men will send away a pretty young woman who
listens to them. Perhaps he will let something slip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha grew stiffer by the word. When Bair
finished, she spat, &ldquo;I will not!&rdquo; Dead silence fell, and every eye
swung to her, but she stared back defiantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will not?&rdquo; Bair said softly. &ldquo;Will not.&rdquo; She seemed
to be tasting words strange in her mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aviendha,&rdquo; Egwene said gently, &ldquo;no one is asking you
to betray Elayne, only to talk to him.&rdquo; If anything, the former
Maiden of the Spear looked even more eager to find herself a
weapon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this the discipline Maidens learn now?&rdquo; Amys said
sharply. &ldquo;If it is, you will find we teach a harder. If there is
some reason you cannot stay near to Rand al&rsquo;Thor, speak it.&rdquo;
Aviendha&rsquo;s defiance wilted a trifle, and she mumbled inaudibly.
Amys&rsquo;s voice took on a knife edge. &ldquo;I said, speak it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not like him!&rdquo; Aviendha burst out. &ldquo;I hate him!
Hate him!&rdquo; Had Egwene not known better, she would have thought her
close to tears. The words shocked her, though; surely Aviendha
could not mean it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are not asking you to love him, or take him to
your bed,&rdquo; Seana said acidly. &ldquo;We are <em>telling</em> you to <em>
listen</em> to the man, and you will obey!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Childishness!&rdquo; Amys snorted. &ldquo;What kind of young
women is the world producing now? Do <em>none</em> of you grow
up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bair and Melaine were even sharper, with the older
woman threatening to tie Aviendha on Rand&rsquo;s horse in place of his
saddle&mdash;she sounded as if she meant it precisely&mdash;and
Melaine suggesting that instead of sleep Aviendha should perhaps
spend the night digging holes and filling them in to clear her
head. The threats were not intended to coerce her, Egwene realized;
these women expected and intended to be obeyed. Any useless labor
Aviendha earned herself would be for being stubborn. That
stubbornness seemed to be shrinking, with four sets of Wise Ones&rsquo;
eyes boring at her&mdash;she settled into more of a defensive
crouch, on her knees&mdash;but she was holding on.</p>

<p>Egwene leaned over to put a hand on Aviendha&rsquo;s
shoulder. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve told me we are near-sisters, and I think we are.
Will you do it for me? Think of it as looking after him for Elayne.
You like her, too, I know. You can tell him she says she meant what
she said in her letters. He will like hearing that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha&rsquo;s face spasmed. &ldquo;I will do it,&rdquo; she said,
slumping. &ldquo;I will watch him for Elayne. For Elayne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amys shook herself. &ldquo;Foolishness. You will watch him
because we told you to, girl. If you think you have another reason,
you will find you are painfully mistaken. More water. The steam is
fading.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha hurled another handful onto the rocks as
though hurling a spear. Egwene was glad to see her spirit
returning, but she thought she would caution her when they were
alone. Spirit was all very well, but there were some women&mdash;these four Wise Ones, for example, and Siuan Sanche&mdash;with
whom it was common sense to keep a check on your spirit. You could
shout at the Women&rsquo;s Circle all day, and you still ended up doing
what they wanted anyway, wishing you had kept your mouth shut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that that is settled,&rdquo; Bair said, &ldquo;let us enjoy
the steam in silence while we can. There is much for some of us yet
to do tonight, and for nights to come, if we are to bring a
gathering to Alcair Dal for Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men always find ways to make work for women,&rdquo; Amys
said. &ldquo;Why should Rand al&rsquo;Thor be different?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quiet settled over the tent except for the hiss when
Aviendha tossed more water on the hot rocks. The Wise Ones sat with
hands on knees, breathing deeply. It was really quite pleasant,
even relaxing, the damp heat, the slick, cleansing feel of sweat on
the skin. Egwene thought it was worth missing a little sleep.</p>

<p>Moiraine did not look relaxed, though. She stared at
the steaming kettle as if seeing something else, far off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it bad?&rdquo; Egwene said softly so as not to disturb
the Wise Ones. &ldquo;Rhuidean, I mean?&rdquo; Aviendha looked up quickly, but
said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The memories fade,&rdquo; Moiraine said, just as quietly.
She did not look away from her distant vision, and her voice was
almost chill enough to take away the heat in the air. &ldquo;Most are
already gone. Some, I knew already. Others&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The Wheel weaves
as the Wheel wills, and we are only the thread of the Pattern. I
have given my life to finding the Dragon Reborn, finding Rand, and
seeing him ready to face the Last Battle. I will see that done,
whatever it requires. Nothing and no one can be more important than
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shivering despite her sweat, Egwene closed her eyes.
The Aes Sedai did not want comforting. She was a lump of ice, not a
woman. Egwene settled herself to trying to recapture that pleasant
feeling. She suspected such would be few and far between in the
days to come.</p>
