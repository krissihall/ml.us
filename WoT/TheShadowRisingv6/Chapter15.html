<h4><em>Into the Doorway</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">H</span>olding
the glass-mantled lamp high, Mat peered down
the narrow corridor, deep in the belly of the Stone. <em>Not unless
my life depended on it. That&rsquo;s what I promised. Well, burn me if it
doesn&rsquo;t!</em></p>

<p>Before doubt could seize him again, he hurried on,
past doors dry-rotted and hanging aslant, past others only shreds
of wood clinging to rusted hinges. The floor had been swept
recently, but the air still smelled of old dust and mold. Something
skittered in the darkness, and he had a knife out before he
realized it was just a rat, running from him, no doubt running
toward some escape hole it knew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Show me the way out,&rdquo; he whispered after it, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;ll come with you.&rdquo; <em>Why am I whispering? There&rsquo;s nobody down
here to hear me</em>. It seemed a place for quiet, though. He could
feel the whole weight of the Stone over his head, pressing
down.</p>

<p>The last door, she had said. That one hung askew,
too. He kicked it open, and it fell apart. The room was littered
with dim shapes, with crates and barrels and things stacked high
against the walls and out into the floor. Dust, too. <em>The Great
Hold! It looks like the basement of an abandoned farmhouse, only
worse</em>. He was surprised that Egwene and Nynaeve had not dusted
and tidied while they were down here. Women were always dusting and
straightening, even things that did not need it. Footprints
crisscrossed the floor, some of them from boots, but no doubt they
had had men to shift the heavier items about for them. Nynaeve
liked finding ways to make a man work; likely she had deliberately
hunted out some fellows enjoying themselves. .</p>

<p>What he sought stood out among the jumble. A tall
redstone doorframe, looming oddly in the shadows cast by his lamp.
When he came closer, it still looked odd. Twisted, somehow. His eye
did not want to follow it around; the corners did not join right.
The tall hollow rectangle seemed likely to fall over at a breath,
but when he gave it an experimental push, it stood steady. He
pushed a bit harder, not sure he did not want to heave the thing
over, and that side of it scraped through the dust. Goose bumps ran
down his arms. There might as well have been a wire fastened to the
top, suspending it from the ceiling. He held the lamp up to see.
There was no wire. <em>At least it won&rsquo;t topple while I&rsquo;m inside.
Light, I am going inside, aren&rsquo;t I?</em></p>

<p>A clutter of figurines and small things wrapped in
rotting cloth occupied the top of a tall, upended barrel near him.
He pushed the jumble to one side so he could set the lamp there,
and studied the doorway. The <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. If Egwene knew
what she was talking about. She probably did; no doubt she had
learned all sorts of strange things in the Tower, however much she
denied. <em>She would deny things, wouldn&rsquo;t she now. Learning to be
Aes Sedai. She didn&rsquo;t deny this though, now did she?</em> If he
squinted, it just looked like a stone doorframe, dully polished and
the duller for dust. Just a plain doorframe. Well, not entirely
plain. Three sinuous lines carved deep in the stone ran down each
upright from top to bottom. He had seen fancier on farmhouses. He
would probably step through and find himself still in this dusty
room.</p>

<p><em>Won&rsquo;t know till I try, will I? Luck!</em> Taking
a deep breath&mdash;and coughing from the dust&mdash;he put his
foot through.</p>

<p>He seemed to be stepping through a sheet of brilliant
white light, infinitely bright, infinitely thick. For a moment that
lasted forever, he was blind; a roaring filled his ears, all the
sounds of the world gathered together at once. For just the length
of one measureless step.</p>

<p>Stumbling another pace, he stared around in
amazement. The <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> was still there, but this was
certainly not where he had started. The twisted stone doorframe
stood in the center of a round hall with a ceiling so high it was
lost in shadows, surrounded by strange spiraled yellow columns
snaking up into the gloom, like huge vines twining &rsquo;round poles
that had been taken away. A soft light came from glowing spheres
atop coiled stands of some white metal. Not silver; the shine was
too dull for that. And no hint of what made the glow; it did not
look like flame; the spheres simply shone. The floor tiles spiraled
out in white and yellow stripes from the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>.
There was a heavy scent in the air, sharp and dry and not
particularly pleasant. He almost turned around and went back on the
spot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A long time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He jumped, a knife coming into his hand, and peered
among the columns for the source of the breathy voice that
pronounced those words so harshly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A long time, yet the seekers come again for answers.
The questioners come once more.&rdquo; A shape moved, back among the
columns; a man, Mat thought. &ldquo;Good. You have brought no lamps, no
torches, as the agreement was, and is, and ever will be. You have
no iron? No instruments of music?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The figure stepped out, tall, barefoot, arms and legs
and body wound about in layers of yellow cloth, and Mat was
suddenly not so sure if it was a man. Or human. It looked human, at
first glance, though perhaps too graceful, but it seemed far too
thin for its height, with a narrow, elongated face. Its skin, and
even its straight black hair, caught the pale light in a way that
reminded him of a snake&rsquo;s scales. And those eyes, the pupils just
black, vertical slits. No, not human.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Iron. Instruments of music. You have none?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat wondered what it thought the knife was; it
certainly did not seem concerned over it. Well, the blade was good
steel, not iron. &ldquo;No. No iron, and no instruments of&mdash;Why&mdash;?&rdquo; He cut off sharply. Three questions, Egwene had said. He
was not about to waste one on &ldquo;iron&rdquo; or &ldquo;instruments of music.&rdquo;
<em>Why should he care if I have a dozen musicians in my pocket and
a smithy on my back?</em> &ldquo;I have come here for true answers. If
you are not the one to give them, take me to who can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man&mdash;it was male at least, Mat decided&mdash;smiled slightly. He did not show any teeth. &ldquo;According to
the agreement. Come.&rdquo; He beckoned with one long-fingered hand.
&ldquo;Follow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat made the knife disappear up his sleeve. &ldquo;Lead,
and I will follow.&rdquo; <em>Just you keep ahead of me and in plain
sight. This place makes my skin crawl</em>.</p>

<p>There was not a straight line to be seen anywhere
except for the floor itself, as he trailed the strange man. Even
the ceiling was always arched, and the walls bowed out. The halls
were continuously curved, the doorways rounded, the windows perfect
circles. Tilework made spirals and sinuous lines, and what seemed
to be bronze metalwork set in the ceiling at intervals was all
complicated scrolls. There were no pictures of anything, no wall
hangings or paintings. Only patterns, and always curves.</p>

<p>He saw no one except his silent guide; he could have
believed the place empty except for the two of them. From somewhere
he had a dim memory of walking halls that had not known a human
foot in hundreds of years, and this felt the same. Yet sometimes he
caught a flicker of motion out of the corner of his eye. Only,
however quickly he turned, there was never anyone there. He
pretended to rub his forearms, checking the knives up his
coatsleeves for reassurance.</p>

<p>What he saw through those round windows was even
worse. Tall wispy trees with only a drooping umbrella of branches
at the top, and others like huge fans of lacy leaves, a tangle of
growth equal to the heart of any briar-choked thicket, all under a
dim, overcast light, though there did not seem to be a cloud in the
sky. There were always windows, always along just one side of the
curving corridor, but sometimes the side changed, and what surely
should have been looking into courtyard or rooms instead gave out
into that forest. He never caught as much as a glimpse of any other
part of this palace, or whatever it was, through those windows, or
any other building, except&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Through one circular window he saw three tall silvery
spires, curving in toward each other so their points all aimed at
the same spot. They were not visible from the next window, three
paces away, but a few minutes later, after he and his guide had
rounded enough curves that he had to be looking in another
direction, he saw them again. He tried telling himself these were
three different spires, but between them and him was one of those
fan-shaped trees with a dangling broken branch, a tree that had
been in the same spot the first time. After his third sight of the
spires and the strange tree with the broken branch, this time ten
paces farther on but on the other side of the hallway, he tried to
stop looking at what lay outside at all.</p>

<p>The walk seemed interminable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When&mdash;? Are&mdash;?&rdquo; Mat ground his teeth.
Three questions. It was hard to learn anything without asking
questions. &ldquo;I hope you are taking me to those who can answer my
questions. Burn my bones, I do. For my sake and yours, the Light
know it true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; the peculiar, yellow-wrapped fellow said,
gesturing with one of those thin hands to a rounded doorway twice
as large as any Mat had seen before. His strange eyes studied Mat
intently. His mouth gaped open, and he inhaled, long and slow. Mat
frowned at him, and the stranger gave a writhing hitch of his
shoulders. &ldquo;Here your answers may be found. Enter. Enter and
ask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat drew a deep breath of his own, then grimaced and
scrubbed at his nose. That sharp, heavy smell was a rank nuisance.
He took a hesitant step toward the tall doorway, and looked around
for his guide again. The fellow was gone. <em>Light! I don&rsquo;t know
why anything in this place surprises me now. Well, I will be burned
if I&rsquo;ll turn back now</em>. Trying not to think of whether he could
find the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> again on his own, he went in.</p>

<p>It was another round room, with spiraling floor tiles
in red and white under a domed ceiling. It had no columns, or
furnishings of any kind, except for three thick, coiled pedestals
around the heart of the floor&rsquo;s spirals. Mat could see no way to
reach the top of them except by climbing the twists, yet a man like
his guide sat cross-legged atop each, only wrapped in layers of
red. Not all men, he decided at a second look; two of those long
faces with the odd eyes had a definite feminine cast. They stared
at him, intense penetrating stares, and breathed deeply, almost
panting. He wondered if he made them nervous in some way. <em>Not
much bloody chance of that. But they&rsquo;re certainly getting under my
coat</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has been long,&rdquo; the woman on the right said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very long,&rdquo; the woman on the left added.</p>

<p>The man nodded. &ldquo;Yet they come again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All three had the breathy voice of the guide&mdash;almost indistinguishable from it, in fact&mdash;and the harsh way
of pronouncing words. They spoke in unison, and the words might as
well have come from one mouth. &ldquo;Enter and ask, according to the
agreement of old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If Mat had thought his skin crawled before, now he
was sure it was writhing. He made himself go closer. Carefully&mdash;careful to say nothing that even sounded like a question&mdash;he laid the situation before them. The Whitecloaks,
certainly in his home village, surely hunting friends of his, maybe
hunting him. One of his friends going to face the Whitecloaks,
another not. His family, not likely in danger, but with the bloody
Children of the bloody Light around&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;A <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>
pulling at him so he could hardly move. He saw no reason to give
names, or mention that Rand was the Dragon Reborn. His first
question&mdash;and the other two, for that matter&mdash;he had
worked out before going down to the Great Hold. &ldquo;Should I go home
to help my people?&rdquo; he asked finally.</p>

<p>Three sets of slitted eyes lifted from him&mdash;reluctantly, it seemed&mdash;and studied the air above his head.
Finally the woman on the left said, &ldquo;You must go to Rhuidean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as she spoke their eyes all dropped to him
again, and they leaned forward, breathing deeply again, but at that
moment a bell tolled, a sonorous brazen sound that rolled through
the room. They swayed upright, staring at one another, then at the
air over Mat&rsquo;s head again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is another,&rdquo; the woman on the left whispered.
&ldquo;The strain. The strain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The savor,&rdquo; the man said. &ldquo;It has been long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is yet time,&rdquo; the other woman told them. She
sounded calm&mdash;they all did&mdash;but there was a sharpness
to her voice when she turned back to Mat. &ldquo;Ask. Ask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat glared up at them furiously. <em>Rhuidean?
Light!</em> That was somewhere out in the Waste, the Light and the
Aiel knew where. That was about as much as he knew. In the Waste!
Anger drove questions about how to get away from Aes Sedai and how
to recover the lost parts of his memory right out his head.
&ldquo;Rhuidean!&rdquo; he barked. &ldquo;The Light burn my bones to ash if I want to
go Rhuidean! And my blood on the ground if I will! Why should I?
You are not answering my questions. You are supposed to answer, not
hand me riddles!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you do not go to Rhuidean,&rdquo; the woman on the
right said, &ldquo;you will die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bell tolled again, louder this time; Mat felt its
tremor through his boots. The looks the three shared were plainly
anxious. He opened his mouth, but they were only concerned with
each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The strain,&rdquo; one of the women said hurriedly. &ldquo;It is
too great.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The savor of him,&rdquo; the other woman said on her
heels. &ldquo;It has been so very long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before she was done the man spoke. &ldquo;The strain is too
great. Too great. Ask. Ask!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn your soul for a craven heart,&rdquo; Mat growled, &ldquo;I
will that! Why will I die if I do not go to Rhuidean? I very likely
will die if I try. It makes no&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man cut him off and spoke hurriedly. &ldquo;You will
have sidestepped the thread of fate, left your fate to drift on the
winds of time, and you will be killed by those who do not want that
fate fulfilled. Now, go. You must go! Quickly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The yellow-clad guide was suddenly there at Mat&rsquo;s
side, tugging at his sleeve with those too-long hands.</p>

<p>Mat shook him off. &ldquo;No! I will not go! You have led
me from the questions I wanted to ask and given me senseless
answers. You will not leave it there. What fate are you talking
about? I will have one clear answer out of you, at least!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A third time the bell sounded mournfully, and the
entire room trembled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; the man shouted. &ldquo;You have had your answers.
You must go before it is too late!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly a dozen of the yellow-clad men were around
Mat, seeming to appear out of the air, trying to pull him toward
the door. He fought with fists, elbows, knees. &ldquo;What fate? Burn
your hearts, what fate?&rdquo; It was the room itself that pealed, the
walls and floor quivering, nearly taking Mat and his attackers off
their feet. &ldquo;What fate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three were on their feet atop the pedestals, and
he could not tell which shrieked which answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To marry the Daughter of the Nine Moons!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To die and live again, and live once more a part of
what was!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To give up half the light of the world to save the
world!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Together they howled like steam escaping under
pressure. &ldquo;Go to Rhuidean, son of battles! Go to Rhuidean,
trickster! Go, gambler! Go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat&rsquo;s assailants snatched him into the air by his
arms and legs and ran, holding him over their heads. &ldquo;Unhand me,
you white-livered sons of goats!&rdquo; he shouted, struggling. &ldquo;Burn
your eyes! The Shadow take your souls, loose me! I will have your
guts for a saddle girth!&rdquo; But writhe and curse as he would, those
long fingers gripped like iron.</p>

<p>Twice more the bell tolled, or the palace did.
Everything shook as in an earthquake; the walls rang with deafening
reverberations, each louder than the last. Mat&rsquo;s captors stumbled
on, nearly falling but never stopping their pell-mell race. He did
not even see where they were taking him until they suddenly stopped
short, heaving him into the air. Then he saw the twisted doorway,
the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, as he flew toward it.</p>

<p>White light blinded him; the roar filled his head
till it drove thought away.</p>

<p>He fell heavily onto a dusty floor in dim light and
rolled up against the barrel holding his lamp in the Great Hold.
The barrel rocked, packets and figurines toppling to the floor in a
crash of breaking stone and ivory and porcelain. Bounding to his
feet, he threw himself back at the stone doorframe. &ldquo;Burn you, you
can&rsquo;t throw me&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He hurtled through&mdash;and stumbled against the
crates and barrels on the other side. Without a pause, he turned
and leaped at it again. With the same result. This time he caught
himself on the barrel holding his lamp, which nearly fell onto the
already shattered things littering the floor under his boots. He
grabbed it in time, burning his hand, and fumbled it back to a
steadier perch.</p>

<p><em>Burn me if I want to be down here in the
dark</em>, he thought, sucking his ringers. <em>Light, the way my
luck is running, it probably would have started a fire and I&rsquo;d have
burned to death!</em></p>

<p>He glared at the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. Why was it not
working? Maybe the folk on the other side had shut it off somehow.
He understood practically nothing of what had happened. That bell,
and their panic. You would have thought they were afraid the roof
would come down on their heads. Come to think of it, it very nearly
had. And Rhuidean, and all the rest of it. The Waste was bad
enough, but they said he was fated to marry somebody called the
Daughter of the Nine Moons. Marry! And to a noblewoman, by the
sound of it. He would sooner marry a pig than a noblewoman. And
that business about dying and living again. <em>Nice of them to add
the last bit!</em> If some black-veiled Aielman killed him on the
way to Rhuidean, he would find out how true it was. It was all
nonsense, and he did not believe a word of it. Only&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The
bloody doorway <em>had</em> taken him somewhere, and they had only
wanted to answer three questions, just the way Egwene had said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t marry any bloody noblewoman!&rdquo; he told the
<em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll marry when I&rsquo;m too old to have any fun,
that&rsquo;s what! Rhuidean my bloody&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A boot appeared, backing out of the twisted stone
doorway, followed by the rest of Rand, with that fiery sword in his
hands. The blade vanished as he stepped clear, and he heaved a sigh
of relief. Even in the dim light, Mat could see he was troubled,
though. He gave a start when he saw Mat. &ldquo;Just poking around, Mat?
Or did you go through, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat eyed him warily for a moment. At least that sword
was gone. He did not seem to be channeling&mdash;though how was
anybody to tell?&mdash;and he did not look particularly like a
madman. In fact, he looked very much as Mat remembered. He had to
remind himself they were not back home any longer, and Rand was
<em>not</em> what he remembered. &ldquo;Oh, I went through, all right. A
bunch of bloody liars, if you ask me! What are they? Made me think
of snakes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not liars, I think.&rdquo; Rand sounded as if he wished
they were. &ldquo;No, not that. They were afraid of me, right from the
first. And when that tolling started&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The sword kept them
back; they wouldn&rsquo;t even look at it. Shied away. Hid their eyes.
Did you get your answers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing that makes sense,&rdquo; Mat muttered. &ldquo;What about
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly Moiraine appeared from the <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, seeming to step gracefully out of thin air,
flowing out. She would be a fine one to dance with if she were not
Aes Sedai. Her mouth tightened at the sight of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You! You were both in there. That is why&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&rdquo;
She made a vexed hiss. &ldquo;One of you would have been bad enough, but
two <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> at once&mdash;you might have torn the
connection entirely and been trapped there. Wretched boys playing
with things you do not know the danger of. Perrin! Is Perrin in
there, too? Did he share your&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>exploit</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The last I saw of Perrin,&rdquo; Mat said, &ldquo;he was getting
ready to go bed.&rdquo; Maybe Perrin would give him the lie by being the
next to step out of the thing, but he might as well deflect the Aes
Sedai&rsquo;s anger if he could. No need for Perrin to face it, too. <em>
Maybe he&rsquo;ll make it clear of her, at least, if he gets away before
she knows what he&rsquo;s doing. Bloody woman! I&rsquo;ll wager</em> she <em>
was noble born</em>.</p>

<p>That Moraine was angry there was no doubt. The blood
had drained out of her cheeks, and her eyes were dark augers boring
into Rand. &ldquo;At least you escaped with your lives. Who told you of
this? Which one of them? I will make her wish I had peeled off her
hide like a glove.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A book told me,&rdquo; Rand said calmly. He sat down back
on the edge of a crate that creaked alarmingly under his weight and
crossed his arms. All very cool; Mat wished he could emulate it. &ldquo;A
pair of books, in fact. <em>Treasures of the Stone</em> and <em>
Dealings with the Territory of Mayene</em>. Surprising what you can
dig out of books if you read long enough, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo; She shifted that drilling gaze to Mat.
&ldquo;Did you read it in a book, too? You?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do read sometimes,&rdquo; he said dryly. He would not
have been averse to a little hide-peeling for Egwene and Nynaeve
after what they had done to make him tell where he had hidden the
Amyrlin&rsquo;s letter&mdash;tying him up with the Power was bad enough,
but the rest!&mdash;yet it was more fun to tweak Moiraine&rsquo;s nose.
&ldquo;<em>Treasures. Dealings</em>. Lots of things in books.&rdquo; Luckily,
she did not insist that he repeat the titles; he had not paid
attention once Rand brought up books.</p>

<p>Instead she swung back to Rand. &ldquo;And your
answers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are mine,&rdquo; Rand replied, then frowned. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t
easy, though. They brought a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;woman&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to interpret, but
she talked like an old book. I could hardly understand some of the
words. I never considered they might speak another language.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Old Tongue,&rdquo; Moiraine told him. &ldquo;They use the
Old Tongue&mdash;a rather harsh dialect of it&mdash;for their
dealings with men. And you, Mat? Was your interpreter easily
understood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had to work moisture back into his mouth. &ldquo;The Old
Tongue? Is that what it was? They didn&rsquo;t give me one. In fact, I
never got to ask any questions. That bell started shaking the walls
down, and they hustled me out like I was tracking cow manure on the
rugs.&rdquo; She was still staring, her eyes still digging into his head.
She knew about the Old Tongue slipping out of him, sometimes. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;almost understood a word here and there, but not to know it.
You and Rand got answers. What do they get out of it? The snakes
with legs. We aren&rsquo;t going upstairs to find ten years gone, are
we, like Bili in the story?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sensations,&rdquo; Moiraine replied with a grimace.
&ldquo;Sensations, emotions, experiences. They rummage through them; you
can feel them doing it, making your skin crawl. Perhaps they feed
on them in some manner. The Aes Sedai who studied this <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em> when it was in Mayene wrote of a strong desire to
bathe afterward. I certainly intend to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But their answers are true?&rdquo; Rand said as she
started to turn away. &ldquo;You are sure of it? The books implied as
much, but can they really give true answers about the future?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The answers are true,&rdquo; Moiraine said slowly, &ldquo;so
long as they are in regard to your own future. That much is
certain.&rdquo; She watched Rand, and himself, weighing the effect of her
words. &ldquo;As to how, though, there is only speculation. That world is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;folded&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;in strange ways. I cannot be clearer. It may be
that that allows them to read the thread of a human life, read the
various ways it may yet be woven into the Pattern. Or perhaps it is
a talent of the people. The answers are often obscure, however. If
you need help working out what yours mean, I offer my services.&rdquo;
Her eyes flickered from one of them to the other, and Mat nearly
swore. She did not believe him about no answers. Unless it was
simply general Aes Sedai suspicion.</p>

<p>Rand gave her a slow smile. &ldquo;And will you tell me
what you asked, and what they answered?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For answer, she returned a level, searching look,
then started for the door. A small ball of light, as bright as a
lantern, was suddenly floating ahead of her, illuminating her
way.</p>

<p>Mat knew he should leave it alone, now. Just let her
go and hope she forgot he had ever been down here. But a knot of
anger still burned inside him. All those ridiculous things they had
said. Well, maybe they were true, if Moiraine said so, but he
wanted to grab those fellows by the collar, or whatever passed for
a collar in those wrappings, and make them explain a few
things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you go there twice, Moiraine?&rdquo; he called
after her. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; He very nearly asked why they worried about
iron and musical instruments, too, and bit his tongue. He could not
know about those if he had not understood what they were
saying.</p>

<p>She paused at the door to the hall, and it was
impossible to see if she was looking at the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> or
at Rand. &ldquo;If I knew everything, Matrim, I would not need to ask
questions.&rdquo; She peered into the room a moment longer&mdash;she
<em>was</em> staring at Rand&mdash;then glided away without
another word.</p>

<p>For a time Mat and Rand looked at each other in
silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Did</em> you find out what you wanted?&rdquo; Rand
asked finally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A bright flame leaped into existence, balanced above
Rand&rsquo;s palm. Not the smooth glowing sphere of the Aes Sedai, but a
rough blaze like a torch. As Rand moved to leave, Mat added another
question. &ldquo;Are you really going to just let the Whitecloaks do
whatever they want back home? You know they&rsquo;re heading for Emond&rsquo;s
Field. If they are not there already. Yellow eyes, the bloody
Dragon Reborn. It&rsquo;s too much, otherwise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perrin will do&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;what he has to do to save
Emond&rsquo;s Field,&rdquo; Rand replied in a pained voice. &ldquo;And I must do what
I have to, or more than Emond&rsquo;s Field will fall, and to worse than
Whitecloaks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat stood watching the light of that flame fade away
down the hall, until he remembered where he was. Then he snatched
up his lamp and hurried out. <em>Rhuidean! Light, what am I going
to do?</em></p>
