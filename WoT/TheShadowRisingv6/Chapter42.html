<h4><em>A Missing Leaf</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">P</span>errin
stood near the Tuatha&rsquo;an wagons under bright
sunlight, alone, and there was no arrow in his side, no pain. Among
the wagons firewood was stacked ready to be lit beneath iron
cookpots hanging from tripods, and clothes hung from washlines;
there were no people or horses. He wore neither coat nor shirt, but
a blacksmith&rsquo;s long leather vest that left his arms bare. It could
have been any dream, perhaps, except that he was aware it was a
dream. And he knew the feel of the wolf dream, the reality and
solidity of it, from the long grass around his boots to the breeze
out of the west that ruffled his curly hair, to the scattered ash
and hemlock. The Tinkers&rsquo; gaudy wagons did not seem real, though;
they had an air of insubstantiality, a feel that they might shimmer
and be gone any moment. They never remained long in one place,
Tinkers. No soil held them.</p>

<p>Wondering how much the land held him, he rested a
hand on his axe&mdash;and looked down in surprise. The heavy
blacksmith&rsquo;s hammer hung in the loop on his belt, not the axe. He
frowned; once he would have chosen that way, had even thought he
had, but surely no more. The axe. He had chosen the axe. Hammerhead
suddenly became half-moon blade and thick spike, flickered back to
stout cylinder of cold steel, fluttered between. Finally it
stopped, as his axe, and he exhaled slowly. That had never happened
before. Here, he could change things as he wanted with ease, things
about himself at least. &ldquo;And I want the axe,&rdquo; he said firmly. &ldquo;The
axe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Looking around, he could just see a farmhouse to the
south, and deer browsing the barley field, surrounded by a rough
stone wall. There was no feel of wolves, and he did not call
Hopper. The wolf might or might not come, or even hear, but Slayer
could well be out there somewhere. A bristling quiver abruptly
tugged at his belt opposite the axe, and he had a stout longbow in
his hand with a broadhead arrow nocked. A long leather bracer
covered his left forearm. Nothing moved except those deer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not likely I&rsquo;ll wake soon,&rdquo; he muttered to himself.
Whatever that stuff was that Faile had fed him, it had taken him
right off; he remembered it as clearly as if he had watched over
her shoulder. &ldquo;Fed it to me like I was a babe,&rdquo; he growled. <em>
Women!</em></p>

<p>He took one of those long strides&mdash;the land
blurred around him&mdash;and stepped into the farmyard. Two or
three chickens scattered, running as if they had already gone
feral. The rock-walled sheepfold stood empty, and both
thatch-roofed barns were barred shut. Despite curtains still at the
windows, the two-story farmhouse had the look of emptiness. If this
was a true reflection of the waking world&mdash;and the wolf dream
usually was, in an odd way&mdash;the people here had been gone for
days. Faile was right; his warning had spread beyond the places he
had gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faile,&rdquo; he murmured wonderingly. Daughter of a lord.
No, not just a lord. Three times a lord, a general, and uncle to a
queen. &ldquo;Light, that makes her a queen&rsquo;s cousin!&rdquo; And she loved a
simple blacksmith. Women were wondrous strange.</p>

<p>Seeking to see how far the word had spread, he
zigzagged more than halfway to Deven Ride, a mile or more at a
stride, doubling back and crisscrossing his own path. Most farms he
saw had that same emptiness; less than one in five showed signs of
habitation, doors open and windows up, wash hung out on a line,
dolls or hoops or carved wooden horses lying around a doorstep. The
toys especially made his stomach clench. Even if they had not
believed his warning, surely there were enough burned farms about
to tell them the same, tumbled heaps of charred timbers, soot-black
chimneys like stark, dead fingers.</p>

<p>Bending to replace a doll with a smiling glass face
and a flower-embroidered dress&mdash;some woman had loved her
daughter to do all that tiny needlework&mdash;he blinked. The same
doll still sat on the fieldstone steps where he had picked it up.
As he reached out, the one in his hand faded and vanished.</p>

<p>Flashes of black in the sky cut short his amazement.
Ravens, twenty or thirty together, winging toward the Westwood.
Toward the Mountains of Mist, where he had first seen Slayer. He
watched coldly while the ravens dwindled to black specks and
disappeared. Then he set off after them.</p>

<p>Long, racing strides carried him five miles each, the
land a blur except in the moment between one step and the next,
into the thick-treed, rocky Westwood, across the scrub-covered Sand
Hills, into the cloud-capped mountains, where fir and pine and
leatherleaf forested valleys and slopes, to the very valley where
he had first seen the man Hopper called Slayer, to the mountainside
where he had returned from Tear.</p>

<p>The Way gate stood there, closed, the <em>
Avendesora</em> leaf seemingly just one among a myriad of
intricately carved leaves and vines. Scattered trees, wizened and
wind-sculpted, dotted the sparse soil among the glazed stone where
Manetheren had been burned away. Sunlight sparkled on the waters of
the Manetherendrelle below. A faint wind up the valley brought him
the scent of deer, rabbits, foxes. Nothing moved that he could
see.</p>

<p>On the point of leaving, he stopped. The <em>
Avendesora</em> leaf. <em>One leaf</em>. Loial had locked the
Waygate by placing both leaves on this side. He turned, and his
hackles rose. The Waygate stood open, twin masses of living
greenery stirring in the breeze, exposing that dull silvery
surface; his reflection shimmered in it. <em>How?</em> he wondered.
<em>Loial locked the bloody thing</em>.</p>

<p>Unaware of crossing the distance, suddenly he was
right at the Waygate. There was no trefoil leaf among the verdant
tangle on the inside of the two gates. Strange to think that at
that moment, in the waking world, someone&mdash;or something&mdash;was passing through where he stood. Touching the dull
surface, he grunted. It might as well have been a mirror; his hand
slid across it as across the smoothest glass.</p>

<p>From the corner of his eye he caught the <em>
Avendesora</em> leaf suddenly in its place on the inside, and
leaped back just as the Waygate began swinging shut. Someone&mdash;or something&mdash;had come out, or gone in. <em>Out. It has to be
out</em>. He wanted to doubt that it was more Trollocs, and Fades,
coming into the Two Rivers. The gates merged, became stone carvings
again.</p>

<p>A sense of being watched was all the warning he had.
He jumped&mdash;a half-seen image of black streaking through where
his chest had been; an arrow&mdash;jumped in one of those
world-blurring stretches, landed on a far slope and jumped again,
out of the valley of Manetheren into a stand of towering fir, and
again. Running, he thought furiously, picturing the valley in his
mind, and that brief glimpse of the arrow. It had come from <em>
that</em> direction, at <em>that</em> angle when it reached him, so
it had to have come from&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A final bound took him back onto a slope above
Manetheren&rsquo;s grave, crouching among meager, wind-slanted pines with
bow ready to draw. Below him, among the stunted trees and boulders,
the arrow had been fired. Slayer had to be down there somewhere. He
had to be down&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Without thinking, Perrin leaped away, the mountains a
smear of gray and brown and green.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Almost,&rdquo; he growled. Almost, he had duplicated his
mistake in the Waterwood, thinking again an enemy would move to
suit him, wait where he wanted.</p>

<p>This time he ran as hard as he could, only three
flashing strides to the edge of the Sand Hills, hoping he had not
been seen. This time he circled wide, coming back higher on that
same mountainside, up where the air felt thin and cold and the few
trees were thick-trunked bushes fifty paces or more apart, up above
where a man might set himself to watch for another who meant to
sneak up on the place that arrow had fired.</p>

<p>And there his quarry was, a hundred paces below,
dark-haired and dark-coated, a tall man crouched beside a
table-sized granite outcrop, his own half-drawn bow in hand,
studying the slope farther down with eager patience. This was the
first time Perrin had gotten a good look at him; a hundred paces
was little distance for his eyes. This Slayer&rsquo;s high collared coat
had a Borderland cut, and his face looked enough like Lan&rsquo;s to be
the Warder&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s. Only Lan had no brothers&mdash;no living
kin at all, that Perrin knew&mdash;and if he had had any, they
would not have been here. A Borderlander, though. Maybe Shienaran,
though his hair was long, not shaved to a topknot, and was held
back by a braided leather cord just like Lan&rsquo;s. He could not be
Malkieri; Lan was the last living Malkieri.</p>

<p>Wherever he came from, Perrin felt no compunction at
all in drawing his bow, broadhead point aimed at Slayer&rsquo;s back. The
man had tried to kill him from ambush. A downhill shot could be
tricky.</p>

<p>Perhaps he had taken too long, or perhaps the fellow
felt his cold gaze, but suddenly Slayer became a blur, streaking
away east.</p>

<p>With a curse, Perrin pursued, three strides to the
Sand Hills, another into the Westwood. Among the oaks and
leatherleaf and underbrush, Slayer seemed to vanish.</p>

<p>Halting, Perrin listened. Silence. The squirrels and
birds had gone still. He inhaled deeply. A small herd of deer had
passed that way not long since. And a faint tinge of something,
human but too cold for a man, too emotionless, a scent that tickled
his mind with familiarity. Slayer was somewhere close. The air lay
as still as the forest; no stir of breeze to tell him which way
that scent came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A neat trick, Goldeneyes, locking the Waygate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin tensed, ears straining. No telling from where
in this dense growth that voice had come. Not so much as a leaf
rustled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you knew how many of the Shadowwrought died
trying to get out of the Ways there, it would lift your heart. <em>
Machin Shin</em> feasted at that gate, Goldeneyes. But not a good
enough trick. You saw: the gate is open now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There, off to the right. Perrin slipped through the
trees as silently as he had when he had hunted here.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was only a few hundred to begin, Goldeneyes. Just
enough to keep those fool Whitecloaks off balance and see that the
renegade died.&rdquo; Slayer&rsquo;s voice became angry. &ldquo;The Shadow consume me
if that man does not have more luck than the White Tower.&rdquo; Abruptly
he chuckled. &ldquo;But you, Goldeneyes. Your presence was a surprise.
There are those who want your head on a pike. Your precious Two
Rivers will be harrowed from end to end, now, to root you out. What
do you say to that, Goldeneyes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin froze close beside the gnarled trunk of a
great oak. Why was the man talking so much? Why was he talking at
all? <em>He&rsquo;s drawing me right to him</em>.</p>

<p>Putting his back against the oak&rsquo;s thick bole, he
studied the forest. No movement. Slayer <em>wanted</em> him to come
nearer. No doubt into an ambush. And he wanted to find the man and
rip his throat out. Yet it could easily be himself who died, and if
that happened, no one would know the Waygate was open, and
Trollocs coming by hundreds, maybe even thousands. He would not
play Slayer&rsquo;s game.</p>

<p>With a mirthless smile he stepped out of the wolf
dream, telling himself to wake, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Faile twined her arms around his neck and
nipped his beard with small white teeth, while Tinkers&rsquo; fiddles
sang some wild, heated tune around the campfires. <em>Ila&rsquo;s powder.
I can&rsquo;t wake up!</em> Awareness that it was a dream faded.
Laughing, he scooped Faile up in his arms and carried her into the
shadows, where the grass was soft.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Waking was a slow process wrapped around the dull
pain filling his side. Daylight streamed in at the small windows.
Bright light. Morning. He tried to sit up, and fell back with a
groan.</p>

<p>Faile sprang up from a low stool; her dark eyes
looked as if she had not slept. &ldquo;Lie still,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You did
enough thrashing in your sleep. I have not kept you from rolling
over and driving that thing the rest of the way through you just to
watch you do it now you&rsquo;re awake.&rdquo; Ihvon stood leaning against the
doorframe like a dark blade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help me up,&rdquo; Perrin said. Talking hurt, but so did
breathing, and he had to talk. &ldquo;I have to get to the mountains. To
the Waygate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put a hand to his forehead, frowning. &ldquo;No fever,&rdquo;
she murmured. Then, more strongly, &ldquo;You are going to Emond&rsquo;s Field,
where one of the Aes Sedai can Heal you. You are <em>not</em> going
to kill yourself trying to ride into the mountains with an arrow in
you. Do you hear me? If I hear one more word about mountains or Waygates,
I will have Ila mix something that will put you back to
sleep, and you will travel on a litter. I&rsquo;m not certain you should
not anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Trollocs, Faile! The Waygate is open again! I
have to stop them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman did not even hesitate before shaking her
head. &ldquo;You can do nothing about it, the state you are in. It is
Emond&rsquo;s Field for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But me no buts, Perrin Aybara. Not another word on
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He ground his teeth. The worst was that she was
right. If he could not rise from a bed alone, how could he stay in
the saddle as far as Manetheren? &ldquo;Emond&rsquo;s Field,&rdquo; he said
graciously, but she still sniffed and muttered something about
&ldquo;pigheaded.&rdquo; What did she want? <em>I</em> was <em>bloody gracious,
burn her for stubborn!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;So there will be more Trollocs,&rdquo; Ihvon said
musingly. He did not ask how Perrin knew. Then he shook his head as
if dismissing Trollocs. &ldquo;I will tell the others you are awake.&rdquo; He
slipped out, closing the door behind him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I the only one who sees the danger?&rdquo; Perrin
muttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see an arrow in you,&rdquo; Faile said firmly.</p>

<p>The reminder gave him a twinge; he just stifled a
groan. And she gave a satisfied nod. Satisfied!</p>

<p>He wanted to be up and on the way immediately; the
sooner he was Healed, the sooner he could see to closing the
Waygate again, permanently this time. Faile insisted on feeding him
breakfast, a broth thick with mashed vegetables suitable for a
toothless infant, one spoon at a time, with pauses to wipe his
chin. She would not let him feed himself, and whenever he protested
or asked her to go faster, she shoved the words back into his mouth
with a spoonful of pap. She would not even let him wash his own
face. By the time she got around to brushing his hair and combing
his beard, he had settled on dignified silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are pretty when you sulk,&rdquo; she said. And pinched
his nose!</p>

<p>Ila, in green blouse and blue skirt this morning,
climbed into the wagon with his coat and shirt, both cleaned and
mended. To his irritation, he had to let the two women help him don
them. He had to let them help him <em>sit up</em> to don them, the
coat unbuttoned and the shirt not tucked in, but bunched around the
arrow stub.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Ila,&rdquo; he said, fingering the neat darns.
&ldquo;This is fine needlework.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;Faile has a deft touch with a
needle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faile colored, and he grinned, thinking of how
fiercely she had told him she would never mend his clothes. A glint
in her eye held his tongue. Sometimes silence was the wiser course.
&ldquo;Thank you, Faile,&rdquo; he said gravely instead. She blushed even
redder.</p>

<p>Once they had him on his feet he reached the door
easily enough, but he had to let the two women half-support him to
climb down the wooden steps. At least the horses were saddled, and
all the Two Rivers lads gathered, bows slung on their backs. With
clean faces and clothes, and only a few bandages out where they
showed.</p>

<p>A night with the Tuatha&rsquo;an had obviously been good
for their spirits, too, even those who still looked as though they
could not walk a hundred paces. The haggardness that had been in
their eyes yesterday was only a shadow now. Wil had each arm around
a pretty, big-eyed Tinker girl, of course, and Ban al&rsquo;Seen, with
his nose and a bandage around his head making his dark hair stand
up in a brush, held hands with another smiling shyly. Most of the
others held bowls of thick vegetable stew and spoons, shoveling
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is good, Perrin,&rdquo; Dannil said, giving up his
empty bowl to a Tinker woman. She gestured as if to ask the
beanpole fellow whether he wanted more, and he shook his head, but
said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I could ever get enough of it, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had my fill,&rdquo; Perrin told him sourly. Mashed
vegetables and broth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Tinker girls danced last night,&rdquo; Dannil&rsquo;s cousin
Tell said, wide-eyed. &ldquo;All the unmarried women, and some of the
married! You should have seen it, Perrin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen Tinker women dance before, Tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Apparently he had not kept his voice clear of what he
had felt watching them, for Faile said dryly, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen the
tiganza, have you? Someday, if you are good, I may dance the
sa&rsquo;sara for you, and show you what a dance really is.&rdquo; Ila gasped
in recognition of the name, and Faile went even redder than she had
inside.</p>

<p>Perrin pursed his lips. If this sa&rsquo;sara set the heart
pounding any harder than the Tinker women&rsquo;s swaying, hip-rolling
dance&mdash;the tiganza, was it?&mdash;he definitely would like
to see Faile dance it. He carefully did not look at her.</p>

<p>Raen came, in the same bright green coat but trousers
redder than any red Perrin had ever seen before. The combination
made his head ache. &ldquo;Twice you have visited our fires, Perrin, and
for the second time you go without a farewell feast. You must come
again soon so we can make up for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pushing away from Faile and Ila&mdash;he could stand
by himself, at least&mdash;he put a hand on the wiry man&rsquo;s
shoulder. &ldquo;Come with us, Raen. No one in Emond&rsquo;s Field will harm
you. At worst it&rsquo;s safer than out here with the Trollocs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Raen hesitated, then shook himself, muttering, &ldquo;I do
not know how you can even make me consider such things.&rdquo; Turning,
he spoke loudly. &ldquo;People, Perrin has asked us to come with him to
his village, where we will be safe from Trollocs. Who wishes to
go?&rdquo; Shocked faces stared back at him. Some women gathered their
children close, and the children hid in their skirts, as if the
very idea frightened them. &ldquo;You see, Perrin?&rdquo; Raen said: &ldquo;For us,
safety lies in moving, not in villages. I assure you, we do not
spend two nights in one place, and we will travel all day before
stopping again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That may not be enough, Raen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Mahdi shrugged. &ldquo;Your concern warms me, but we
will be safe, if the Light wills it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Way of the Leaf is not only to do no violence,&rdquo;
Ila said gently, &ldquo;but to accept what comes. The leaf falls in its
proper time, uncomplaining. The Light will keep us safe for our
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin wanted to argue with them, but behind all the
warmth and compassion on their faces lay a stony firmness. He
thought he would get Bain and Chiad to don dresses and give up
their spears&mdash;or Gaul to!&mdash;before he made these people
budge an inch.</p>

<p>Raen shook Perrin&rsquo;s hand, and with that the Tinker
women began hugging the Two Rivers lads, and Ihvon, too, and the
Tinker men began shaking hands, all laughing and saying goodbyes
and wishing everyone a safe journey, hoping they would come again.
Almost all the men did. Aram stood off to one side, frowning to
himself, hands thrust into his coat pockets. The last time Perrin
met him he had seemed to have a sour streak, odd for a Tinker.</p>

<p>The men did not content themselves with shaking
Faile&rsquo;s hand, but hugged her. Perrin kept his face smooth when some
of the younger men became overly enthusiastic, only grinding his
teeth a little; he managed to smile. No woman much younger than Ila
hugged him. Somehow, even while Faile was letting some skinny,
gaudy-coated Tinker fold his arms around her and try to squeeze her
flat, she stood guard on him like a mastiff. Women without gray in
their hair took one look at her face and chose someone else.
Meanwhile Wil appeared to be kissing every woman in the camp. So
was Ban, and his nose. Even Ihvon was enjoying himself, for that
matter. It would serve Faile right if one of those fellows cracked
a rib for her.</p>

<p>Finally the Tinkers moved back, except for Raen and
Ila, opening a space around the Two Rivers folk. The wiry,
gray-haired man-bowed formally, hands to chest. &ldquo;You came in peace.
Depart now in peace. Always will our fires welcome you. The Way of
the Leaf is peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peace be on you always,&rdquo; Perrin replied, &ldquo;and on all
the People.&rdquo; <em>Light, let it be so</em>. &ldquo;I will find the song,
or another will find the song, but the song will be sung, this year
or in a year to come.&rdquo; He wondered if there ever had been a song,
or if the Tuatha&rsquo;an had begun their endless journey seeking
something else. Elyas had told him they did not know what song,
only that they would know it when they found it. <em>Let them find
safety, at least. At least that</em>. &ldquo;As it once was, so shall it
be again, world without end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;World without end,&rdquo; the Tuatha&rsquo;an responded in a
solemn murmur. &ldquo;World and time without end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few final hugs and handshakes were handed &rsquo;round
while Ihvon and Faile were helping Perrin up on Stepper. A few last
kisses collected by Wil. And Ban. Ban! <em>And</em> his nose!
Others, the badly wounded, were half-lifted onto their horses, with
Tinkers waving as if to old neighbors off on a long journey.</p>

<p>Raen came to shake Perrin&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Will you not
reconsider?&rdquo; Perrin asked. &ldquo;I remember hearing you say once there
was wickedness loose in the world. It&rsquo;s worse now, Raen, and
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peace be on you, Perrin,&rdquo; Raen replied, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And on you,&rdquo; he said sadly.</p>

<p>The Aiel did not appear until they were a mile north
of the Tinker camp, Bain and Chiad looking to Faile before trotting
ahead to their usual place. Perrin was not sure what they thought
might have happened to her among Tuatha&rsquo;an.</p>

<p>Gaul moved in beside Stepper, striding easily. The
party was not moving very fast, with nearly half the men walking.
He glanced at Ihvon measuringly as usual, before turning to Perrin.
&ldquo;Your injury is well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His injury hurt like fury; every step his horse took
jolted that arrowhead. &ldquo;I feel fine,&rdquo; he said, not gritting his
teeth. &ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ll have a dance in Emond&rsquo;s Field tonight! And you?
Did you pass a good night playing Maidens&rsquo; Kiss?&rdquo; Gaul stumbled and
nearly fell on his face. &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who did you hear suggest this game?&rdquo; the Aielman
said quietly, staring straight ahead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chiad. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chiad,&rdquo; Gaul muttered. &ldquo;The woman is Goshien.
Goshien! I should take her back to Hot Springs as <em>
gai&rsquo;shain</em>.&rdquo; The words sounded angry, but not his odd tone.
&ldquo;Chiad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you tell me what is the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Myrddraal has less cunning than a woman,&rdquo; Gaul
said in a flat voice, &ldquo;and a Trolloc fights with more honor.&rdquo; After
a moment he added, in a fierce undertone, &ldquo;And a goat has more
sense.&rdquo; Quickening his pace, he ran forward to join the two
Maidens. He did not speak to them, as far as Perrin could make out,
only slowed to walk alongside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you understand any of that?&rdquo; Perrin asked Ihvon.
The Warder shook his head.</p>

<p>Faile sniffed. &ldquo;If he thinks to make trouble for
them, they will hang him by his heels from a branch to cool
off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you understand it?&rdquo; Perrin asked her. She walked
along, neither looking at him nor answering, which he took to mean
she did not. &ldquo;I think I might have to find Raen&rsquo;s camp again. It
has been a long time since I saw the tiganza. It was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;interesting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She muttered something under her breath, but he
caught it: &ldquo;You could do with hanging by the heels yourself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiled down at the top of her head. &ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t
have to. You promised to dance this sa&rsquo;sara for me.&rdquo; Her face went
crimson. &ldquo;Is it anything close to the tiganza? I mean, there is no
point, otherwise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You muscle-brained oaf!&rdquo; she snapped, glaring up at
him. &ldquo;Men have thrown their hearts and fortunes at the feet of
women who danced the sa&rsquo;sara. If Mother suspected I knew it&mdash;&rdquo;
Her teeth clicked shut as though she had said too much, and her
head whipped back to face forward; scarlet mortification covered
her from her dark hair down to the neck of her dress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there isn&rsquo;t any reason for you to dance it,&rdquo; he
said quietly. &ldquo;My heart and fortune, such as they are, already lie
at your feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faile missed a step, then laughed softly and pressed
her cheek against his booted calf. &ldquo;You are too clever for me,&rdquo; she
murmured. &ldquo;One day I will dance it for you, and boil the blood in
your veins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You already do that,&rdquo; he said, and she laughed
again. Pushing her arm behind his stirrup, she hugged his leg to
her as she walked.</p>

<p>After a while even the thought of Faile dancing&mdash;he extrapolated from the Tinker dance; it must be something
to top that&mdash;could not compete with the pain in his side.
Every stride Stepper took was agony. He held himself upright. It
seemed to hurt a fraction less, that way. Besides, he did not want
to spoil the lift the Tuatha&rsquo;an had given everyone&rsquo;s spirits. The
other men were sitting up straight in their saddles, too, even
those who had been hunched over and clinging the day before. And
Ban and Dannil and the others walked with heads up. He would not be
the first to slump.</p>

<p>Wil began to whistle &ldquo;Coming Home from Tarwin&rsquo;s Gap,&rdquo;
and three or four more took it up. After a time, Ban began to sing
in a clear, deep voice:</p>

<p class="verse_quote">&ldquo;My home is waiting there for me,<br>
and the girl I left behind.<br>
Of all the treasure that waits for me,<br>
that&rsquo;s what I want to find.<br>
Her eyes so merry, and her smile so sweet,<br>
her hugs so warm, and her ankle neat,<br>
her kisses hot, now there&rsquo;s a treat.<br>
If there&rsquo;s a treasure greater, it lies not in my mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>More joined in on the second verse, until everyone
sang, even Ihvon. And Faile. Not Perrin, of course; he had been
told often enough that he sounded like a stepped-on frog, singing.
Some even fell into step with the music.</p>

<p class="verse_quote">&ldquo;Oh, I have seen stark Tarwin&rsquo;s Gap,<br>
 and the Trollocs&rsquo; raving horde.<br>
I have stood &rsquo;fore the Halfman&rsquo;s charge,<br>
and walked on death&rsquo;s cold borde.<br>
But a winsome lass, she waits for me,<br>
for a dance, and a kiss &rsquo;neath the apple tree&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin shook his head. A day before they had been
ready to run and hide. Today they sang, about a battle so long ago
that it had left no memory but this song in the Two Rivers. Perhaps
they were becoming soldiers. They would have to, unless he managed
to close that Waygate.</p>

<p>Farms began to appear more often, closer together,
until they traveled along hard-packed dirt between fields bordered
by hedges or low, rough stone walls. Abandoned farms. No one here
clung to the land.</p>

<p>They came to the Old Road, which ran north from the
White River, the Manetherendrelle, through Deven Ride to Emond&rsquo;s
Field, and at last began to see sheep in the pastures, great clumps
like a dozen men&rsquo;s flocks gathered together, with ten shepherds
where there once would have been one, and half of them grown men.
Bow-armed shepherds watched them pass, singing at the tops of their
lungs, not knowing quite what to make of it.</p>

<p>Perrin did not know what to make of his first view of
Emond&rsquo;s Field, and neither did the other Two Rivers men, from the
way their singing faltered and died.</p>

<p>The trees, fences and hedges closest to the village
were simply gone, cleared away. The westernmost houses of Emond&rsquo;s
Field had once stood among the trees on the edge of the Westwood.
The oaks and leatherleaf between the houses remained, but now the
forest&rsquo;s brim stood five hundred paces away, a long bowshot, and
axes rang loud as men pushed it back farther. Row on row of
waist-high stakes, driven into the ground at an angle, surrounded
the village a little out from the houses and presented a continuous
hedge of sharpened points, except where the road ran in. At
intervals behind the stakes men stood like sentries, some wearing
bits of old armor or leather shirts sewn with rusty steel discs, a
few in dented old steel caps, with boar spears, or halberds rooted
out of attics, or bush hooks fitted to long poles. Other men, and
boys, were up on some of the thatched roofs with bows; they stood
when they saw Perrin and the others coming, and shouted to people
below.</p>

<p>Beside the road behind the stakes stood a contraption
of wood and thick, twisted rope, with a nearby pile of stones
bigger than a man&rsquo;s head. Ihvon noticed Perrin frowning at it as
they came closer. &ldquo;Catapult,&rdquo; the Warder said. &ldquo;Six, so far. Your
carpenters knew what to do once Tomas and I showed them. The stakes
will hold off charging Trollocs or Whitecloaks, either one.&rdquo; He
might have been discussing the prospects for more rain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you your village was preparing to defend
itself.&rdquo; Faile sounded fiercely proud, as though it were her
village. &ldquo;A hard people, for such a soft land. They could almost be
Saldaean. Moiraine always said Manetheren&rsquo;s blood runs strong here
still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin could only shake his head.</p>

<p>The hard-packed dirt streets were nearly crowded
enough for a city, the gaps between houses filled with carts and
wagons, and through open doors and unshuttered windows he could see
more people. The crowd parted before Ihvon and the Aiel, and
rustling whispers accompanied them along the street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Perrin Goldeneyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perrin Goldeneyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perrin Goldeneyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He wished they would not do that. These people knew
him, some of them. What did they think they were doing? There was
horse-faced Neysa Ayellin, who had paddled his ten-year-old
backside that time Mat talked him into stealing one of her
gooseberry pies. And there was pink-cheeked, big-eyed Cilia Cole,
the first girl he had ever kissed and still pleasingly plump, and
Pel Aydaer, with his pipe and his bald head, who had taught Perrin
how to catch trout with his hands, and Daise Congar herself, a
tall, wide woman who made Alsbet Luhhan seem soft, with her husband
Wit, a scrawny man overshadowed as always by his wife. And they
were all staring at him, and whispering to the people from off, who
might not know who he was. When old Cenn Buie lifted a little boy
up on his shoulder, pointing at Perrin and talking enthusiastically
to the boy, Perrin groaned. They had all gone mad.</p>

<p>Townsfolk trailed after Perrin and the others, around
them, in a parade that rode a swell of murmurs. Chickens scurried
every which way under people&rsquo;s feet. Bawling calves and pigs
squealing in pens behind the houses competed with the noise of the
humans. Sheep crowded the Green, and black-and-white milkcows
cropped the grass in company with flocks of geese, gray and
white.</p>

<p>And in the middle of the Green rose a tall pole, the
red-bordered white banner at its peak rippling lazily, displaying a
red wolf&rsquo;s head. He looked at Faile, but she shook her head, as
surprised as he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A symbol.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin had not heard Verin approach, though now he
caught hushed whispers of &ldquo;Aes Sedai&rdquo; floating around her. Ihvon
did not look surprised. People stared at her with awe-filled
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;People need symbols,&rdquo; Verin went on, resting a hand
on Stepper&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;When Alanna told a few of the villagers how
much Trollocs fear wolves, everyone seemed to think this banner a
grand idea. Don&rsquo;t you, Perrin?&rdquo; Was there a dryness in her voice
then? Her dark eyes looked up at him, birdlike. A bird watching a
worm?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what Queen Morgase will think of that,&rdquo;
Faile said. &ldquo;This is part of Andor. Queens seldom like strange
banners being raised in their realms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing but lines on a map,&rdquo; Perrin told her.
It was good to be still; the throbbing from the arrowhead seemed to
have abated somewhat. &ldquo;I did not even know we were supposed to be
part of Andor until I went to Caemlyn. I doubt many people
here do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rulers have a tendency to believe maps, Perrin.&rdquo;
There was no doubt of the dryness in Faile&rsquo;s tone. &ldquo;When I was a
child, there were parts of Saldaea that had not seen a taxman in
five generations. Once Father could turn his attention from the
Blight for a time, Tenobia made sure they knew who their queen
was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the Two Rivers,&rdquo; he said, grinning, &ldquo;not
Saldaea.&rdquo; They did sound very fierce, up there in Saldaea. As he
turned back to Verin, the grin became a frown. &ldquo;I thought you were&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;hiding&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;who you are.&rdquo; He could not say which was more
disturbing; Aes Sedai there in secret, or Aes Sedai in the
open.</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai&rsquo;s hand hovered an inch from the
broken-off arrow jutting from his side. Something tingled around
the wound. &ldquo;Oh, this is not good,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Caught in the
rib, and some infection in spite of that poultice. This needs
Alanna, I think.&rdquo; She blinked and pulled her hand back; the tingle
went, too. &ldquo;What? Hiding? Oh. With what has been stirred up here
now, we could hardly remain hidden. I suppose we could have&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;gone away. You wouldn&rsquo;t want that, would you?&rdquo; There was that
sharp, considering, birdlike stare again.</p>

<p>He hesitated, and finally sighed. &ldquo;I suppose
not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that is good to hear,&rdquo; she said with a
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you really come here, Verin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not seem to hear him. Or did not want to.
&ldquo;Now we need to see to that thing in you. And these other lads need
to be looked after, too. Alanna and I will see to the worst, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The men with him were as stunned by what they found
here as he was. Ban scratched his head at the banner, and a few
just stared around in amazement. Most looked at Verin, though,
wide-eyed and uneasy; they had surely heard the whispers of &ldquo;Aes
Sedai.&rdquo; Perrin was not escaping those looks entirely himself, he
realized, talking to an Aes Sedai as though she were just any
village woman.</p>

<p>Verin considered them right back, then suddenly,
without seeming to look, reached behind her to snatch a girl of
about ten or twelve out of the onlookers. The girl, her long dark
hair caught up with blue ribbons, went rigid with shock. &ldquo;You know
Daise Congar, girl?&rdquo; Verin said. &ldquo;Well, you find her and tell her
there are injured men who need a Wisdom&rsquo;s herbs. And tell her to
jump. You tell her I&rsquo;ll have no patience with her airs. Do you have
that? Off with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin did not recognize the girl, but evidently she
did know Daise, because she flinched at the message. But Verin was
an Aes Sedai. After a moment of weighing&mdash;Daise Congar
against an Aes Sedai&mdash;the girl scampered away into the
crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Alanna will take care of you,&rdquo; Verin said,
peering up at him again.</p>

<p>He wished she did not sound as though there might be
two meanings to that.</p>
