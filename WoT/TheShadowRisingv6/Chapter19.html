<h4><em>The Wavedancer</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">W</span>ith
the golden sun barely over the horizon, the
shiny black-lacquered carriage rocked to a halt at the foot of the
wharf behind a team of four matched grays, and the lanky
dark-haired driver in his black-and-gold striped coat leaped down
to open the door. No sigil adorned the door panel, of course;
Tairen nobles gave aid to Aes Sedai only under duress, no matter
how effusive the smiles, and none wanted their names or Houses
linked to the Tower.</p>

<p>Elayne got down gratefully without waiting for
Nynaeve, straightening her blue linen summer traveling cloak; the
streets of the Maule were rutted by carts and wagons, and the
carriage&rsquo;s leather springs had not been very good. A breeze
slanting across the Erinin actually seemed cool after the heat of
the Stone. She had intended to show no effects of the rough ride,
but once upright she could not help knuckling the small of her
back. <em>At least last night&rsquo;s rain still holds the dust
down</em>, she thought. She suspected that they had been given a
carriage without curtains on purpose.</p>

<p>North and south of her, more docks like wide stone
fingers stretched into the river. The air smelled of tar and rope,
fish and spices and olive oil, of nameless things rotting in the
stagnant water between the piers and peculiar long yellow-green
fruits in huge bunches heaped in front of the stone warehouse
behind her. Despite the early hour, men wearing leather vests on
shiftless shoulders scurried about, toting large bundles on bent
backs or pushing handcarts piled with barrels or crates. None
spared her more than a passing sullen glance, dark eyes falling
quickly, forelock touched grudgingly; most did not raise their
heads at all. She was sad to see it.</p>

<p>These Tairen nobles had handled their people badly.
Mishandled them was more like it. In Andor she could have expected
cheerful smiles and a respectful word of greeting, freely given by
straight-backed men who knew their worth as well as hers. It was
almost enough to make her regret leaving. She had been raised to
lead and one day govern a proud people, and she felt the urge to
teach these folk dignity. But that was Rand&rsquo;s job, not hers. <em>
And if he doesn&rsquo;t do it properly, I</em> will <em>give him a piece
of my mind. A bigger piece</em>. At least he had begun, by
following her advice. And she had to admit he knew how to treat his
people. It would be interesting to see what he had done by the time
she returned. <em>If there&rsquo;s a point to coming back</em>.</p>

<p>A dozen ships were clearly visible from where she
stood, and more beyond, but one, moored across the end of the dock
she faced, sharp bow upriver, filled her eyes. The Sea Folk raker
was easily a hundred paces long, half again as large as the next
vessel in sight, with three great towering masts amidships, and one
shorter on the raised deck at the stern. She had been on ships
before, but never one so big, and never on one going to sea. Just
the name of the ship&rsquo;s owners spoke of distant lands and strange
ports. The Atha&rsquo;an Miere. The Sea Folk. Stories meant to be exotic
always contained the Sea Folk, unless they were about the Aiel.</p>

<p>Nynaeve climbed out of the carriage behind her, tying
a green traveling cloak at her neck and grumbling to herself and to
the driver. &ldquo;Tumbled about like a hen in a windstorm! Thumped like
a dusty rug! How did you manage to find every last rut and hole
between here and the Stone, goodman? That took true skill. A pity
none of it goes into handling horses.&rdquo; He tried to hand her down,
his narrow face sullen, but she refused his aid.</p>

<p>Sighing, Elayne doubled the number of silver pennies
she was taking from her purse. &ldquo;Thank you for bringing us safely
and swiftly.&rdquo; She smiled as she pressed the coins into his hand.
&ldquo;We told you to go fast, and you did as we asked. The streets are
not your fault, and you did an excellent job under poor
conditions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without looking at the coins, the fellow gave her a
deep bow, a grateful look, and a murmured &ldquo;Thank you, my Lady,&rdquo; as
much for the words as the money, she was sure. She had found that a
kind word and a little praise were usually received as well as
silver was, if not better. Though the silver itself was seldom
unappreciated, to be sure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light send you a safe journey, my Lady,&rdquo; he
added. The merest flicker of his eyes toward Nynaeve said that wish
was for Elayne alone. Nynaeve had to learn how to make allowances
and give consideration; truly she did.</p>

<p>When the driver had handed their bundles and
belongings out of the carriage, turned his team and started away,
Nynaeve said grudgingly, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have snapped at the man, I
suppose. A bird could not make an easy way over those streets. Not
in a carriage, at any rate. But after bouncing about all the way
here, I feel as if I&rsquo;d been on horseback a week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t his fault you have a sore&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;back,&rdquo;
Elayne said, with a smile to take away any sting, as she took up
her things.</p>

<p>Nynaeve barked a wry laugh. &ldquo;I said that, didn&rsquo;t I?
You will not expect me to go running after him to apologize, I
hope. That handful of silver you gave him should soothe any wounds
short of mortal. You really must learn to be more careful with
money, Elayne. We do not have the Realm of Andor&rsquo;s resources for
our own use. A family could live comfortably for a month on what
you hand out to everyone who does the work they&rsquo;ve been paid to do
for you.&rdquo; Elayne gave her a quietly indignant look&mdash;Nynaeve
always seemed to think they should live worse than servants unless
there was reason not to, instead of the other way around, as made
sense&mdash;but the older woman did not appear to notice the
expression that always put Royal Guardsmen on their toes. Instead,
Nynaeve hoisted her bundles and sturdy cloth bags and turned down
the dock. &ldquo;At least this ship will be a smoother ride than that. I
do hope smooth. Shall we go aboard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As they picked their way down the pier, between
working men and stacked barrels and carts full of goods, Elayne
said, &ldquo;Nynaeve, the Sea Folk can be touchy until they know you, or
so I was taught. Do you think you might try to be a little&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tactful, Nynaeve.&rdquo; Elayne skipped a step as someone
spat on the dock in front of her. There was no telling which fellow
had done it; when she looked around they all had their heads down
and were hard at work. Mishandling by the High Lords or no, she
would have said a few quietly sharp words that the culprit would
not have soon forgotten if she could have found him. &ldquo;You might try
to be a little tactful for once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Nynaeve started up the raker&rsquo;s
rope-railed gangway. &ldquo;As long as they do not bounce me about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s first thought on reaching the deck was that
the raker appeared very narrow for its length; she did not know a
great deal about ships, in truth, but to her it seemed a huge
splinter. <em>Oh, Light, this thing will toss worse than the
carriage, however big it is</em>. Her second was for the crew. She
had heard stories about the Atha&rsquo;an Miere, but had never seen one
before. Even the stories told little, really. A secretive people
who kept to themselves, almost as mysterious as the Aiel. Only the
lands beyond the Waste could possibly be more strange, and all
anyone knew of them was that the Sea Folk brought ivory and silk
from there.</p>

<p>These Atha&rsquo;an Miere were dark, barefoot and
bare-chested men, all cleanly shaven, with straight black hair and
tattooed hands, moving with the sureness of those who knew their
tasks well enough to do them with half a mind but were putting
their whole minds to it. There was a rolling grace to their
movements, as though, with the ship still, they yet felt the
motions of the sea. Most wore gold or silver chains abound their
necks, and rings in their ears, sometimes two or three in each, and
some with polished stones.</p>

<p>There were women among the crew, too, as many as the
men, hauling ropes and coiling lines right with the men, with the
same tattooed hands, in the same baggy breeches of some dark, oiled
cloth, held by colorful narrow sashes and hanging open at the
ankle. But the women wore loose colorful blouses, too, all
brilliant reds and blues and greens, and they had at least as many
chains and earrings as the men. Including, Elayne noticed with a
small shock, two or three women with rings in one side of their
noses.</p>

<p>The grace of the women outshone even that of the men,
and put Elayne in mind of some stories she had heard as a child by
listening where she was not supposed to. Women of the Atha&rsquo;an Miere
were, in those tales, the epitome of alluring beauty and
temptation, pursued by all men. The women on this ship were no more
beautiful than any others, really, but watching them move, she
could believe those tales.</p>

<p>Two of the women, on the raised deck at the stern,
were obviously not ordinary crew. They were barefoot, too, and
their garb of the same cut, but one was clothed entirely in
brocaded blue silks, the other in green. The older of the pair, the
one in green, wore four small gold rings in each ear and one in the
left side of her nose, all worked so they sparkled in the morning
sunlight. A fine chain ran from her tiny nose ring to one earring,
supporting a row of tiny dangling gold medallions, and one of the
chains around her neck held a pierced golden box, like ornate gold
lace, that she lifted to sniff from time to time. The other woman,
the taller, had only six earrings in total, and fewer medallions.
The pierced box she sniffed at was just as finely wrought gold,
though. Exotic, indeed. Elayne winced just thinking about the nose
rings. And that chain!</p>

<p>Something odd about the sterndeck itself caught her
eye, but at first she could not tell what. Then she saw. There was
no tiller for the rudder. Some sort of spoked wheel stood behind
the women, lashed down so it could not turn, but no tiller. <em>How
do they steer?</em> The smallest riverboat she had seen had had a
tiller. There had been tillers on all the others ships lining the
nearby docks. More and more mysterious, these Sea Folk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember what Moiraine told you,&rdquo; she cautioned as
they approached the sterndeck. That had not been much; even Aes
Sedai knew little about the Atha&rsquo;an Miere. Moiraine had imparted
the proper phrasings, though; the things that had to be said for
good manners. &ldquo;And remember tact,&rdquo; she added in a firm whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will remember,&rdquo; Nynaeve replied sharply. &ldquo;I can be
tactful.&rdquo; Elayne truly hoped she would.</p>

<p>The two Sea Folk women waited for them at the top of
the stairs&mdash;ladder, Elayne remembered, even when they were
stairs. She did not understand why ships had to have different
names for common things. A floor was a floor, in a barn or an inn
or a palace. Why not on a ship? A cloud of perfume surrounded the
two, a slightly musky scent, wafting from the lacy gold boxes. The
tattoos on their hands were stars and seabirds surrounded by the
curls and whirls of stylized waves.</p>

<p>Nynaeve inclined her head. &ldquo;I am Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara,
Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah. I seek the Sailmistress of this
vessel, and passage, if it pleases the Light. This is my companion
and friend, Elayne Trakand, also Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah. The
Light illumine you and your vessel, and send the winds to speed
you.&rdquo; That was almost exactly the way Moiraine had instructed them
to speak. Not about Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah&mdash;Moiraine had
seemed resigned to that more than anything else, and amused at
their choice of Ajah&mdash;but the rest.</p>

<p>The older woman, with gray touches in her black hair
and fine wrinkles at the corners of her large brown eyes, inclined
her head just as formally. Nevertheless, she seemed to be taking
them in from head to foot, especially the Great Serpent ring each
wore on her right hand. &ldquo;I am Coine din Jubai Wild Winds,
Sailmistress of <em>Wavedancer</em>. This is Jorin din Jubai White
Wing, my sister of the blood and Windfinder of <em>Wavedancer</em>.
There may be passage available, if it pleases the Light. The Light
illumine you, and see you safe to your journey&rsquo;s end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a surprise that the two were sisters. Elayne
could see the resemblance, but Jorin looked much younger. She
wished the Windfinder were the one they had to deal with; both
women had the same reserve, but something about the Windfinder
reminded her of Aviendha. It was absurd, of course. These women
were no taller than she herself, their coloring could not have been
more different from the Aiel woman&rsquo;s, and the only weapon either
had in sight was the stout knife tucked in her sash, looking very
workmanlike despite carvings and gold-wire inlays on the handle.
But Elayne could not help feeling some similarity, between Jorin
and Aviendha, anyway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us talk then, Sailmistress, if it pleases you,&rdquo;
Nynaeve said, following Moiraine&rsquo;s formula, &ldquo;of sailings and ports,
and the gift of passage.&rdquo; The Sea Folk did not charge for passage,
according to Moiraine; it was a gift, which just coincidentally
would be exchanged for a gift of equal value.</p>

<p>Coine glanced away, then, astern toward the Stone and
the white banner rippling over it. &ldquo;We will talk in my cabin, Aes
Sedai, if it pleases you.&rdquo; She motioned toward an open hatch behind
that strange wheel. &ldquo;The welcome of my ship to you, and the grace
of the Light be upon you until you leave his decks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another narrow ladder&mdash;staircase&mdash;led
down into a neat room, larger and taller than Elayne had expected
from her experiences on smaller vessels, with windows across the
stern and gimbaled lamps on the walls. Almost everything seemed to
have been built into the room except for a few lacquered chests of
various sizes. The bed was large and low, right under the
sternwindows, and a narrow table surrounded by armchairs stood
across the middle of the room.</p>

<p>There was very little clutter. Rolled charts lay on
the table, a few ivory carvings of strange animals stood on railed
shelves, and half a dozen bare-bladed swords of different shapes,
some that Elayne had never seen before, rested on hooks on the
walls. An oddly worked square brass gong hung from a beam over the
bed, while right before the sternwindows, as if in a place of
honor, a helmet sat on a featureless wooden head carved for the
purpose, a helmet like the head of some monstrous insect, lacquered
in red and green, with a narrow white plume to either side, one
broken.</p>

<p>The helmet Elayne recognized. &ldquo;Seanchan,&rdquo; she gasped
before thinking. Nynaeve gave her a vexed look, and deservedly;
they had agreed it would make more sense, and ring more true, if
Nynaeve, as the older, took the lead and did most of the
talking.</p>

<p>Coine and Jorin exchanged unreadable glances. &ldquo;You
know of them?&rdquo; the Sailmistress said. &ldquo;Of course. One must expect
Aes Sedai to know these things. This far east we hear a score of
stories, the truest less than half-true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne knew she should leave it at that, but
curiosity tickled her tongue. &ldquo;How did you come by the helmet? If I
may ask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Wavedancer</em> encountered a Seanchan ship last
year,&rdquo; Coine replied. &ldquo;They wished to take him, but I did not wish
to give him up.&rdquo; She shrugged slightly. &ldquo;I have the helmet to
remind me, and the sea took the Seanchan, the Light be merciful to
all who sail. I will not go close to a vessel with ribbed sails
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were lucky,&rdquo; Nynaeve said curtly. &ldquo;The Seanchan
hold captive women who can channel, and make them channel as a
weapon. If they had had one on that ship, you would be regretting
ever having seen it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne grimaced at her, though it was too late. She
could not tell whether the Sea Folk women were offended by
Nynaeve&rsquo;s tone. The pair kept the same neutral expressions, but
Elayne was beginning to realize they did not show very much on
their faces, not to strangers, anyway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us speak of passage,&rdquo; Coine said. &ldquo;If it pleases
the Light, we may call where you wish to go. All things are
possible, in the Light. Let us sit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chairs around the table did not slide back; they
and the table were fastened to the floor&mdash;deck. Instead the
arms swung out like gates and latched in place once you had sat.
The arrangement seemed to bear out Elayne&rsquo;s dire predictions of
heaving and pitching. She did very well with it herself, of course,
but too much rolling on a riverboat set Nynaeve&rsquo;s stomach jumping.
It must be worse on the ocean than on a river, however fierce the
wind, and the worse Nynaeve&rsquo;s stomach, the worse her temper.
Nynaeve sicking up and in a bad choler at the same time: there were
few things more dreadful, in Elayne&rsquo;s experience.</p>

<p>She and Nynaeve were placed together on one side of
the table, with the Sailmistress and the Windfinder at the ends. At
first it seemed strange, until she realized they would both look at
whichever of the two was talking, allowing the other to watch them
unobserved. <em>Do they always deal with passengers this way, or is
it because we&rsquo;re Aes Sedai? Well, because they think we are</em>.
It was a caution that everything might not be as simple as they
hoped with these people. She hoped Nynaeve was taking notice.</p>

<p>Elayne had not seen any order passed, but a slender
young woman with only one ring in each ear appeared, bearing a tray
with a square white brass-handled teapot and large handleless cups,
not of Sea Folk porcelain as might have been expected, but thick
pottery. Less likely to be broken in heavy weather, she decided
bleakly. It was the young woman who took her attention, though, and
nearly brought a gasp. She was bare to the waist, just like the men
above. Elayne hid her shock very well, she thought, but Nynaeve
sniffed loudly.</p>

<p>The Sailmistress waited until the girl had poured tea
brewed to blackness, then said, &ldquo;Have we sailed, Dorele, when I did
not see? Is there no land in sight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The slender woman blushed furiously. &ldquo;There is land,
Sailmistress.&rdquo; It was a miserable whisper.</p>

<p>Coine nodded. &ldquo;Until there is no land in sight, and
has been none for one full day, you will work at cleaning the
bilges, where garments are a hindrance. You may leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sailmistress,&rdquo; the girl said, even more
woefully. She turned away, undoing her red sash dejectedly as she
went through the door at the far end of the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Share this tea, if it please you,&rdquo; the Sailmistress
said, &ldquo;that we may talk in peace.&rdquo; She sipped at her own and
continued while Elayne and Nynaeve were tasting theirs. &ldquo;I ask that
you forgive any offense, Aes Sedai, This is Dorele&rsquo;s first voyage
except between the islands. The young often forget the ways of the
shorebound. I will punish her further, if you are affronted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no need,&rdquo; Elayne said hastily, taking the
excuse to set her cup down. The tea was even stronger than it
looked, very hot, unsweetened and quite bitter. &ldquo;Truly, we were not
offended. There are different ways among different peoples.&rdquo; <em>
The Light send not too many more as different as that! Light, what
if they don&rsquo;t wear any clothes at all once they get out to sea?
Light!</em> &ldquo;Only a fool takes offense at customs different from
her own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve gave her a level look, bland enough for the
Aes Sedai they were pretending to be, and took a deep swallow from
her cup. All she said was &ldquo;Please think no more of it.&rdquo; It was not
possible to tell if she meant it for Elayne or the Sea Folk
women.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we will speak of passage, if it pleases you,&rdquo;
Coine said. &ldquo;To what port do you wish to sail?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tanchico,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, a bit more briskly than she
should have. &ldquo;I know you may not mean to sail there, but we need to
go quickly, as quickly as only a raker can, and without stopping,
if that is possible. I offer this small gift, for the
inconvenience.&rdquo; She took a paper from her belt pouch and unfolded
it, pushing it down the table to the Sailmistress.</p>

<p>Moiraine had given that to them, and another like it,
letters-of-rights. Each allowed the bearer to draw up to three
thousand gold crowns from bankers and moneylenders in various
cities, though it was not likely any of those men and women knew it
was White Tower money they held. Elayne had goggled at the amount&mdash;Nynaeve had gaped openly&mdash;but Moiraine said it might
be needed to make the Sailmistress forsake her intended ports of
call.</p>

<p>Coine touched the letter-of-rights with one finger,
read. &ldquo;A vast sum for the gift of passage,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;even
counting that you ask me to alter my sailing plans. I am more
surprised now than before. You know that we very seldom carry Aes
Sedai on our ships. Very seldom. Of all who ask passage, only Aes
Sedai may be refused, and almost always are, as from the first day
of the first sailing. Aes Sedai know this, and so almost never
ask.&rdquo; She was looking into her teacup, not at them, but Elayne
glanced the other way and caught the Windfinder studying their
hands lying on the table. No, their rings.</p>

<p>Moiraine had not said anything about this. She had
pointed out the raker as the swiftest ship available and encouraged
them to make use of it. Then again, she had given them these
letters-of-rights, very likely sufficient to buy a fleet of ships
like this one. Well, several ships, at the least. <em>Because she
knew it would take that much to bribe them to carry us?</em> But
why had she kept secrets? A foolish question; Moiraine always kept
secrets. But why waste their time?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to refuse us passage?&rdquo; Nynaeve had
 abandoned tact for bluntness. &ldquo;If you do not carry Aes
Sedai, why did you bring us down here? Why not tell us up above and
be done with it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Sailmistress unlatched one arm of her chair, rose
and went to peer out of the sternwindows at the Stone. Her earrings
and the medallions across her left cheek glittered in the light of
the rising sun. &ldquo;He can wield the One Power, so I have heard, and
he holds the Sword That Cannot Be Touched. The Aiel have come over
the Dragonwall to his call; I have seen several in the streets,
and it is said they fill the Stone. The Stone of Tear has fallen,
and war breaks over the nations of the land. Those who once ruled
have returned, and been driven back for the first time. Prophecy is
being fulfilled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve looked as confounded as Elayne felt at this
change of subject. &ldquo;The Prophecies of the Dragon?&rdquo; Elayne said
after a moment. &ldquo;Yes, they are being fulfilled. He is the Dragon
Reborn, Sailmistress.&rdquo; <em>He&rsquo;s a stubborn man who hides his
feelings so deeply I cannot find them, that is what he is!</em></p>

<p>Coine turned. &ldquo;Not the Prophecies of the Dragon, Aes
Sedai. The Jendai Prophecy, the prophecy of the Coramoor. Not the
one you wait for and dread; the one we seek, herald of a new Age.
At the Breaking of the World our ancestors fled to the safety of
the sea while the land heaved and broke as storm waves do. It is
said they knew nothing of the ships they took to flee, but the
Light was with them, and they survived. They did not see the land
again until it was still once more, and by then, much had changed.
All&mdash;everything&mdash;the world&mdash;drifted on the water
and the wind. It was in the years after that the Jendai Prophecy
was first spoken. We must wander the waters until the Coramoor
returns, and serve him at his coming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are bound to the sea; the salt water courses in
our veins. Most of us set no foot on the land except to await
another ship, another sailing. Strong men weep when they must serve
ashore. Women ashore go onto a ship to bear their children&mdash;into a rowboat if no more is at hand&mdash;for we must be born on
the water, as we must die on it, and be given to it in death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Prophecy is being fulfilled. He is the Coramoor.
Aes Sedai serve him. You are proof of that, that you are here in
this city. That is in the Prophecy as well. &lsquo;The White Tower shall
be broken by his name, and Aes Sedai shall kneel to wash his feet
and dry them with their hair.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will have a long wait if you expect to see me
wash any man&rsquo;s feet,&rdquo; Nynaeve said wryly. &ldquo;What does this have to
do with our passage? Will you take us, or not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne cringed, but the Sailmistress came back just
as directly. &ldquo;Why do you wish to journey to Tanchico? It is an
unpleasant port of call now. I docked there last winter. Shorefolk
nearly swarmed my vessel seeking passage out, to anywhere. They did
not care, so long as it was away from Tanchico. I cannot believe
conditions are any better now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you always question your passengers so?&rdquo; Nynaeve
said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve offered you enough to buy a village. Two villages! If
you want more, name your price.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a price,&rdquo; Elayne hissed in her ear. &ldquo;A
gift!&rdquo;</p>

<p>If Coine was offended, or even had heard, she gave no
sign. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve took a tight grip on her braid, but Elayne
laid a hand on her arm. They had planned to keep a few secrets
themselves, but surely they had learned enough since sitting down
to alter any plan. There was a time for secrecy and a time for
truth. &ldquo;We hunt the Black Ajah, Sailmistress. We believe some of
them are in Tanchico.&rdquo; She met Nynaeve&rsquo;s angry stare calmly. &ldquo;We
must find them, else they may harm&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the Dragon Reborn. The
Coramoor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light see us safe to docking,&rdquo; the Windfinder
breathed. It was the first time she had spoken, and Elayne stared
at her in surprise. Jorin was frowning, and not looking at anyone,
but she spoke to the Sailmistress. &ldquo;We can take them, my sister. We
must.&rdquo; Coine nodded.</p>

<p>Elayne exchanged looks with Nynaeve and saw her own
questions mirrored in the other woman&rsquo;s eyes. Why was it the
Windfinder who decided? Why not the Sailmistress? She was the
captain, whatever her title. At least they were going to get
passage after all. <em>For how much?</em> Elayne wondered. <em>How
large a &lsquo;gift&rsquo; ?</em> She wished Nynaeve had not revealed that they
had more than was in that one letter-of-rights. <em>And she accuses
me of tossing gold about</em>.</p>

<p>The door opened and a heavy-shouldered gray-haired
man in loose green silk breeches and sash came in, ruffling through
a sheaf of papers. Four gold rings decorated each ear, and three
heavy gold chains hung at his neck, including one with a perfume
box. A long puckered scar down his cheek, and two curved knives
tucked in his sash, gave him something of a dangerous air. He was
fastening a peculiar wire framework over his ears to hold clear
lenses in front of his eyes. The Sea Folk made the best looking
glasses and burning lenses and the like, of course, somewhere on
their islands, but Elayne had never seen anything like this device.
He peered through the lenses at the papers and began talking
without looking up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coine, this fool is willing to trade me five hundred
snowfox pelts from Kandor for those three small barrels of Two
Rivers tabac I got in Ebou Dar. Five hundred! He can have them here
by midday.&rdquo; His eyes rose, and he gave a start. &ldquo;Forgive me, my
wife. I did not know you had guests. The Light be with you
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By midday, my husband,&rdquo; Coine said, &ldquo;I will be
falling downriver. By nightfall I will be at sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stiffened. &ldquo;Am I still Cargomaster, wife, or has
my place been taken while I did not see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are Cargomaster, husband, but the trading must
stop now and preparations begin for getting under way. We sail for
Tanchico.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tanchico!&rdquo; The papers crumpled in his fist, and he
brought himself under control with an effort. &ldquo;Wife&mdash;No!
Sailmistress, you told me our next port was Mayene, and then
eastward to Shara. I have traded with that in mind. Shara,
Sailmistress, not Tarabon. What I have in my holds will bring
little in Tanchico. Perhaps nothing! May I ask why my trade is to
be ruined and <em>Wavedancer</em> impoverished?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Coine hesitated, but when she spoke her voice was
still formal. &ldquo;I am Sailmistress, my husband. <em>Wavedancer</em>
sails when and where I say. It must be enough, for now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you say, Sailmistress,&rdquo; he rasped, &ldquo;so it is.&rdquo; He
touched his heart&mdash;Elayne thought Coine flinched&mdash;and
padded out with his back stiff as one of the ship&rsquo;s masts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must make this up to him,&rdquo; Coine murmured softly,
staring at the door. &ldquo;Of course, it is pleasant making up with him.
Usually. He saluted me like a deckboy, sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We regret being a cause of trouble, Sailmistress,&rdquo;
Elayne said carefully. &ldquo;And we regret having witnessed this. If we
have caused any embarrassment, to anyone, please accept our
apologies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Embarrassment?&rdquo; Coine sounded startled. &ldquo;Aes Sedai,
I am Sailmistress. I doubt your presence embarrassed Toram, and I
would not apologize to him for that if it did. Trade is his, but I
am Sailmistress. I must make up to him&mdash;and it will not be
easy, since I must keep the reason secret still&mdash;because he
is right, and I could not think quickly enough to give him a reason
beyond what I would give a raw hand. That scar on his face he
earned clearing the Seanchan from <em>Wavedancer&rsquo;s</em> decks. He
has older scars earned defending my ship, and I have only to put
out my hand to have gold placed in it because of his trading. It is
the things I cannot tell him I must make up to him, because he
deserves to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not understand,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. &ldquo;We would ask
you to keep the Black Ajah secret&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;&mdash;she shot a hard
look at Elayne, one that promised hard words once they were alone;
Elayne intended a few words of her own, about the meaning of tact&mdash;&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but surely three thousand crowns is reason enough to
take us to Tanchico.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must keep you secret, Aes Sedai. What you are, and
why you travel. Many among my crew consider Aes Sedai bad luck. If
they knew they not only carried Aes Sedai, but toward a port where
other Aes Sedai may serve the Father of Storms&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The grace of
the Light shone on us that none was close enough to hear me call
you so above. Will it offend if I ask you to keep below as much as
possible, and not to wear your rings when on deck?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For answer, Nynaeve plucked her Great Serpent ring
off and dropped it into her pouch. Elayne did the same, a bit more
reluctantly; she rather enjoyed having people see her ring. Not
quite trusting Nynaeve&rsquo;s remaining store of diplomacy at this
point, she spoke up before the other woman could. &ldquo;Sailmistress, we
have offered you a gift of passage, if it pleases you. If it does
not, may I ask what would?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Coine came back to the table to look at the
letter-of-rights again, then pushed it back to Nynaeve. &ldquo;I do this
for the Coramoor. I will see you safe ashore where you wish, if it
pleases the Light. It shall be done.&rdquo; She touched the fingers of
her right hand to her lips. &ldquo;It is agreed, under the Light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jorin made a strangled sound. &ldquo;My sister, has a
Cargomaster ever mutinied against his Sailmistress?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Coine gave her a flat-eyed stare. &ldquo;I will put in the
gift of passage from my own chest. And if Toram ever hears of it,
my sister, I will put you in the bilges with Dorele. For ballast,
perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That the two Sea Folk women had dropped formality was
confirmed when the Windfinder laughed aloud. &ldquo;And then your next
port would be in Chachin, my sister, or Caemlyn, for you could not
find the water without me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Sailmistress addressed Elayne and Nynaeve
regretfully. &ldquo;Properly, Aes Sedai, since you serve the Coramoor, I
should honor you as I would Sailmistress and Windfinder of another
ship. We should bathe together and drink honeyed wine and tell each
other stories to make ourselves laugh and weep. But I must make
ready to sail, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Wavedancer</em> rose like his name, leaping,
pounding against the dock. Elayne whipped back and forth in her
chair, wondering as it continued whether this was really better
than being thrown to the deck.</p>

<p>Then, finally, it was over, the leaps slowing,
growing smaller. Coine scrambled to her feet and raced for the
ladder, Jorin at her heels, already shouting orders to look for
damage to the hull.</p>
