<h4><em>Decisions</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>hree
days passed with heat and damp that seemed to
sap even the Tairens&rsquo; strength. The city slowed to a lethargic
walk, the Stone to a crawl. Servants worked nearly in their sleep;
the majhere tore her coiled braids in frustration, but even she
could not find the energy to rap knuckles or flick ears with a hard
finger. Defenders of the Stone slumped at their posts like
half-melted candles, and the officers showed more interest in
chilled wine than in making their rounds. The High Lords kept
largely to their apartments, sleeping through the hottest part of
the day, and a few left the Stone entirely for the relative cool of
estates far to the east, on the slopes of the Spine of the World.
Oddly, only the outlanders, who felt the heat worst of all, pushed
on with their lives as hard as ever, if not harder. For them, the
heavy heat did not weigh nearly as much as did the hours rushing
by.</p>

<p>Mat quickly discovered that he had been right about
the young lords who saw the playing cards try to kill him. Not only
did they avoid him, they spread the word among their friends, often
garbled; no one in the Stone who had two pieces of silver in hand
would say more than hasty excuses while backing away. The rumors
spread beyond the lordlings. More than one serving woman who had
enjoyed a cuddle now declined, too, and two said uneasily that they
had heard it was dangerous to be alone with him. Perrin appeared
all wrapped up in his own worries, and Thom seemed to vanish by
sleight of hand; Mat had no idea what occupied the gleeman, but he
was seldom to be found, day or night, Moiraine, the one person Mat
wished would ignore him, instead seemed to be there whenever he
turned around; she was just passing by, or crossing the corridor in
the distance, but her eyes met his every last time, looking as if
she knew what he was thinking and what he wanted, knew how she was
going to make him do exactly what she wanted instead. None of it
made any difference in one respect; he still managed to find
excuses to put off leaving for another day. As he saw it, he had
not <em>promised</em> Egwene he would stay. But he did.</p>

<p>Once, he carried a lamp down into the belly of the
Stone, to the so-called Great Holding, as far as the dry-rotted
door at the far end of the narrow hallway. A few minutes of peering
into the shadowy interior at dim shapes covered with dusty canvas,
roughly stacked crates and barrels, their flat ends used as shelves
for jumbles of figurines and carvings and peculiar things of
crystal and glass and metal&mdash;a few minutes of that, and he hurried
away, muttering, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have to be the biggest bloody fool in the
whole bloody world!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nothing kept him from going into the city, though,
and there was no chance at all of meeting Moiraine in the dockside
taverns of the Maule, the port district, or the inns in the Chalm,
where the warehouses were, dimly lit, cramped, often dirty places
of cheap wine, bad ale, occasional fights and unending dice games.
The stakes in the dice games were small, compared to what he had
grown used to, but that was not why he always found himself back in
the Stone after a few hours. He tried not to think about what
always drew him back, near to Rand.</p>

<p>Perrin sometimes saw Mat in the waterfront taverns,
drinking too much cheap wine, dicing as if he did not care whether
he won or lost, once flashing a knife when a burly shipman pressed
him on how often he did win. It was not like Mat to be so
irritable, but Perrin avoided him instead of trying to find out
what was troubling him. Perrin was not there for wine or dice, and
the men who thought of fighting changed their minds after a good
look at his shoulders&mdash;and his eyes. He bought bad ale,
though, for sailors in wide leather trousers and for
under-merchants with thin silver chains across their coat fronts,
for any man who looked to be from a distant land. It was rumor he
hunted, word of something that might draw Faile away from Tear.
Away from him.</p>

<p>He was sure if he found an adventure for her,
something that smacked of a chance at putting her name in the
stories, she would go. She pretended to understand why he had to
stay, but occasionally she still hinted that she wanted to leave
and hoped he would go with her. He was certain the right bait would
pull her, without him.</p>

<p>Most rumors she would know for outdated twistings of
the truth, just as he did. The war that burned along the Aryth
Ocean was said to be the work of a people no one had ever heard of
before called the Sawchin, or something like it&mdash;he heard
many variations from many tellers&mdash;a strange folk who might
be Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s armies come back after a thousand years. One
fellow, a Taraboner in a round, red hat and a mustache as thick as
a bull&rsquo;s horns, solemnly informed him that Hawkwing himself led
these people, his legendary sword Justice in hand. There were
rumors that the fabled Horn of Valere, meant to call dead heroes
from the grave to fight in the Last Battle, had been found. In
Ghealdan, riots had broken out all over the country; Illian was
suffering from outbreaks of mass madness; in Cairhien, famine was
slowing the killing; someplace in the Borderlands, Trolloc raids
were on the increase. Perrin could not send Faile into any of that,
not even to get her away from Tear.</p>

<p>Reports of trouble in Saldaea seemed promising&mdash;her own home must be attractive to her, and he had heard that
Mazrim Taim, the false Dragon, was safely in Aes Sedai hands&mdash;but no one knew what sort of trouble. Making something up would do
no good; whatever he found, she would surely ask her own questions
before chasing after it. Besides, any turmoil in Saldaea might
easily be as bad as the other things he heard.</p>

<p>He could not tell her where he was spending his time,
either, because she would inevitably ask why. She knew he was not
Mat, to enjoy lolling about taverns. He had never been good at
lying, so he put her off as best he could, and she began to give
him long, silent, slanted looks. All he could do was redouble his
efforts to find a tale to lure her away. He had to send her away
from him before he got her killed. He had to.</p>

<p>Egwene and Nynaeve spent more hours with Joiya and
Amico, to no avail. Their stories never wavered. Over Nynaeve&rsquo;s
protests, Egwene even tried telling each of them what the other had
said, to see if anything joggled loose. Amico stared at them,
whining that she had never heard any such plan. But it might be
true, she added. It might. She sweated with eagerness to please.
Joiya coolly told them to go to Tanchico if they wished. &ldquo;It is an
uncomfortable city now, I hear,&rdquo; she said smoothly, raven eyes
glittering. &ldquo;The King holds little more than the city itself, and I
understand the Panarch has ceased keeping civil order. Strong arms
and quick knives rule Tanchico. But go, if it pleases you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No word came from Tar Valon, nothing to say if the
Amyrlin was dealing with the possible threat to free Mazrim Taim.
There had been plenty of time for a message to come, by quick
riverboat or a man changing horses, since Moiraine had sent the
pigeons&mdash;provided she had sent them. Egwene and Nynaeve argued about
that; Nynaeve admitted the Aes Sedai could not lie, but she tried
to find some twist in Moiraine&rsquo;s words. Moiraine did not seem to
fret over the lack of response from the Amyrlin, though it was hard
to tell through her crystal calm.</p>

<p>Egwene did fret over it, and over whether Tanchico
was a false trail, or a real one, or a trap. The Stone&rsquo;s library
held books about Tarabon and Tanchico, but though she read until
her eyes ached she found no clue to anything dangerous to Rand.
Heat and worry did nothing for her temper; she was sometimes as
snappish as Nynaeve.</p>

<p>Some things were going well, of course. Mat was still
in the Stone; obviously he really was growing up and learning about
responsibility. She regretted failing him, but she was not certain
any woman in the Tower could have done more. She understood his
thirst to know, because she thirsted, too, although for other
knowledge, for the things she could only learn in the Tower, the
things she might discover that no one else had known how to do
before, the lost things she might relearn.</p>

<p>Aviendha began to visit with Egwene, apparently of
her own choice. If the woman was wary at first, well, she was Aiel,
after all, and she did think Egwene was full Aes Sedai. Still, her
company was enjoyable, although Egwene sometimes thought she saw
unasked questions in her eyes. If Aviendha kept her reserve, it
soon became apparent that she had a quick wit, and a sense of humor
akin to Egwene&rsquo;s; they sometimes ended up giggling together like
girls. Aiel ways were nothing Egwene was used to, though, such as
Aviendha&rsquo;s discomfort at sitting in a chair, and her shock at
finding Egwene in her bath, a silver-plated tub the majhere had had
brought up. Not shock at walking in on her naked&mdash;in fact,
when she saw that Egwene was uncomfortable, she peeled off her own
clothes and sat down on the floor to talk&mdash;but at seeing
Egwene sitting chest-deep in water. It was dirtying so much water
that made her eyes pop. For another thing, Aviendha refused to
understand why she and Elayne had not done something drastic to
Berelain, since they wanted her out of the way. It was all but
forbidden for a warrior to kill a woman not wed to the spear, but
since neither Elayne nor Berelain were Maidens of the Spear, it was
apparently quite all right in Aviendha&rsquo;s view for Elayne to
challenge the First of Mayene to fight with knives, or failing that
with fists and feet. Knives were best, as she saw it. Berelain
looked the sort of woman who could be beaten several times without
giving up. Best simply to challenge and kill her. Or Egwene could
do it for her, as friend and near-sister.</p>

<p>Even with that, it was a pleasure to have someone to
talk and laugh with. Elayne was occupied most of the time, of
course, and Nynaeve, seeming to feel the rush of time as keenly as
Egwene, gave her free moments over to moonlit walks on the
battlements with Lan and to preparing foods the Warder liked with
her own hands, not to mention curses that sometimes drove the cooks
from the kitchen; Nynaeve did not know very much about cooking. If
not for Aviendha, Egwene was not sure what she would have done in
the muggy hours between questionings of the Darkfriends; sweated,
undoubtedly, and worried that she might have to do something that
gave her nightmares thinking of it.</p>

<p>By agreement, Elayne was never present at those
questionings; one more set of ears listening would make no
difference. Instead, whenever Rand had a moment to spare, the
Daughter-Heir just happened to be close by, to talk, or simply walk
holding his arm, even if it was only from a meeting with some High
Lords to a room where others waited, or to a lightning inspection
of the Defenders&rsquo; quarters. She became quite good at finding
secluded corners where the two of them could pause, alone. Of
course, he always had Aiel trailing after him, but she soon cared
as little for what they thought as for what her mother would. She
even entered a sort of conspiracy with the Maidens of the Spear;
they seemed to know every hidden nook in the Stone, and they let
her know whenever Rand was alone. They seemed to think the game
great sport.</p>

<p>The surprise was that he asked her about the
governing of nations and listened to what she said. That, she
wished her mother could see. More than once Morgase had laughed,
half-despairingly, and told her she had to learn to concentrate.
Which crafts to protect and how, and which not and why, might be
dry decisions, but as important as how to care for the sick. It
might be fun to guide a stubborn lord or merchant into doing what
he did not want to while thinking it was his own idea, it might be
warming to feed the hungry, but if the hungry were to be fed it was
necessary to decide how many clerks and drivers and wagons were
needed. Others might arrange it, but then you would never know
until it was too late whether they had made a mistake. He listened
to her, and often took her advice. She thought she could have loved
him for those two things alone. Berelain was not setting foot
outside her chambers; Rand had begun smiling as soon as he saw her;
nothing could be finer about the world. Unless the days could stop
passing.</p>

<p>Three short days, slipping away like water through
her fingers. Joiya and Amico would be sent north and the reason for
staying in Tear would vanish; it would be time for her and Egwene
and Nynaeve to leave, too. She would go, when that time came; she
had never considered not. Knowing that made her proud of behaving
like a woman, not a girl; knowing it made her want to cry.</p>

<p>And Rand? He met with High Lords in his chambers and
issued orders. He startled them by appearing at secret gatherings
of three or four that Thom had ferreted out, just to reiterate some
point from his last commands. They smiled and bowed and sweated and
wondered how much he knew. A use had to be found for their energy
before one of them decided that if Rand could not be manipulated,
he must be killed. Whatever it took to divert them, he would not
start a war. If he had to confront Sammael, so be it; but he would
not start a war.</p>

<p>Forming his plan of action occupied most of his time
not given over to hounding the High Lords. Bits and pieces came
from the books he had the librarians bring to his rooms by
armloads, and from his talks with Elayne. Her advice was certainly
useful with the High Lords; he could see them hastily reassessing
him when he displayed knowledge of things they themselves only
half-knew. She stopped him when he wanted to give her the
credit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A wise ruler takes advice,&rdquo; she told him, smiling,
&ldquo;but should never be seen to take it. Let them think you know more
than you do. It will not harm them, and it will help you.&rdquo; She
seemed pleased he had suggested it, though.</p>

<p>He was not entirely sure that he was not still
putting off some decision, at least, because of her. Three days of
planning, of trying to puzzle out what was still missing. Something
was. He could not react to the Forsaken; he had to make them react
to him. Three days, and on the fourth she would go&mdash;back to
Tar Valon, he hoped&mdash;but once he moved, he suspected even
their brief moments together would end. Three days of stolen
kisses, when he could forget he was anything but a man with his
arms around a woman. He knew it for a foolish reason, if true. He
was relieved she did not seem to want more than his company, but in
those moments alone he could forget decisions, forget the fate
awaiting the Dragon Reborn. More than once he considered asking her
to stay, but it would not be fair to raise her expectations when he
had no idea what he wanted from her beyond her presence. If she had
any expectations, of course. Much better just to think of them as a
man and a young woman walking out together of a feastday evening.
That became easier; sometimes he forgot she was the Daughter-Heir,
and he a shepherd. But he wished she were not going. Three days. He
had to decide. He had to move. In a direction no one expected.</p>

<p>The sun slid slowly toward the horizon on the evening
of the third day. The half-drawn draperies of Rand&rsquo;s bedchamber
lessened the reddish yellow glare. <em>Callandor</em> glittered on
its ornate stand like the purest crystal.</p>

<p>Rand stared at Meilan and Sunamon, then tossed the
thick bundle of large vellum sheets at them. A treaty, all neatly
scribed, lacking only signatures and seals. It hit Meilan in the
chest, and he caught it by reflex; he bowed as if honored, but his
tight smile revealed clenched teeth.</p>

<p>Sunamon shifted from foot to foot, dry-washing his
hands. &ldquo;All is as you said, my Lord Dragon,&rdquo; he said anxiously.
&ldquo;Grain for ships&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And two thousand Tairen levies,&rdquo; Rand cut him off.
&ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;To see to proper distribution of the grain and protect Tairen
interests.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; His voice was like ice, but his stomach seemed to be
boiling; he nearly shook with the desire to pound at these fools
with his fists. &ldquo;Two thousand men. Under the command of
Torean!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The High Lord Torean has an interest in affairs with
Mayene, my Lord Dragon,&rdquo; Meilan said smoothly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has an interest in forcing his attentions on a
woman who won&rsquo;t look at him!&rdquo; Rand shouted. &ldquo;Grain for ships, I
said! No soldiers. And certainly no bloody Torean! Have you even
spoken to Berelain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They blinked at him as if they did not understand the
words. It was too much. He snatched at <em>saidin</em>; the vellum
in Meilan&rsquo;s arms erupted into flame. With a yell, Meilan hurled the
fiery bundle into the bare fireplace and hurriedly brushed at
sparks and scorch marks on his red silk coat. Sunamon stared at the
burning sheets, which were crackling and turning black, with his
mouth hanging open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will go to Berelain,&rdquo; he told them, surprised at
how calm his voice was. &ldquo;By tomorrow midday you will have offered
her the treaty I want, or by sunset tomorrow I&rsquo;ll hang both of you.
If I have to hang High Lords every day, two by two, I will. I will
send every last one of you to the gallows if you won&rsquo;t obey me.
Now, get out of my sight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The quiet tone seemed to affect them more than his
shouting had. Even Meilan looked uneasy as they backed away, bowing
at every other step, murmuring protestations of undying loyalty and
everlasting obedience. They sickened him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; he roared, and they abandoned dignity,
almost fighting with one another to pull the doors open. They ran.
One of the Aiel guards put his head in for a moment, to see that
Rand was all right, before drawing the door shut.</p>

<p>Rand trembled openly. They disgusted him almost as
much as he disgusted himself. Threatening to hang men because they
did not do as he told them. Worse, meaning it. He could remember
when he did not have a temper, or, at least, when he rarely had,
and had managed to keep it on a short rein.</p>

<p>He crossed the room to where <em>Callandor</em>
sparkled with the light streaming in between the draperies. The
blade looked like the finest glass, absolutely clear; it felt like
steel to his fingers, sharp as a razor. He had come close to
reaching for it, to deal with Meilan and Sunamon. Whether to use it
as a sword or for its real purpose, he did not know. Either
possibility horrified him. <em>I am not mad yet. Only angry. Light,
so angry!</em></p>

<p>Tomorrow. The Darkfriends would be put on a ship,
tomorrow. Elayne would be leaving. And Egwene and Nynaeve, of
course. Back to Tar Valon, he prayed; Black Ajah or no Black
Ajah, the White Tower had to be as safe a place as there was
now. Tomorrow. No more excuses to put off what he had to do. Not
after tomorrow.</p>

<p>He turned his hands over, looking at the heron
branded into each palm. He had examined them so often that he could
have sketched every line perfectly from memory. The Prophecies
foretold them.</p>

<p class="verse">Twice and twice shall he be marked,<br>
twice to live, and twice to die.<br>
Once the heron to set his path.<br>
Twice the heron, to name him true.<br>
Once the Dragon, for remembrance lost.<br>
Twice the Dragon, for the price he must pay.</p>

<p>But if the herons &ldquo;named him true,&rdquo; what need for
Dragons? For that matter, what was a Dragon? The only Dragon he had
ever heard of was Lews Therin Telamon. Lews Therin Kinslayer had
been the Dragon; the Dragon was the Kinslayer. Except now there was
himself. But he could not be marked with himself. Perhaps the
figure on the banner was a Dragon; not even Aes Sedai seemed to
know what that creature was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are changed from when I last saw you. Stronger.
Harder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spun, gaping at the young woman standing by the
door, fair of skin and dark of hair and eye. Tall, dressed all in
white and silver, she arched an eyebrow at the half-melted lumps of
gold and silver over the fireplace. He had left them there to
remind him what could happen when he acted without thinking, when
he lost control. Much good it had done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Selene,&rdquo; he gasped, hurrying to her. &ldquo;Where did you
come from? How did you get here? I thought you must still be in
Cairhien, or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Looking down at her, he did not want to say he
feared she might be dead, or a starving refugee.</p>

<p>A woven silver belt glittered around her narrow
waist; silver combs worked with stars and crescent moons shone in
hair that fell to her shoulders like waterfalls of night. She was
still the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. Elayne and Egwene
were only pretty beside her. For some reason, though, she did not
affect him the way she had; perhaps it was the long months since he
had last seen her, in a Cairhien not yet racked by civil war.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I go where I wish to be.&rdquo; She frowned at his face.
&ldquo;You have been marked, but no matter. You were mine, and you are
mine. Any other is no more than a caretaker whose time has passed.
I will lay claim to what is mine openly, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stared at her. Marked? Did she mean his hands? And
what did she mean, he was hers? &ldquo;Selene,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;we had
pleasant days together&mdash;and hard days; I&rsquo;ll never forget your
courage, or your help&mdash;but there was never more between us
than companionship. We traveled together, but that was the end of
it. You will stay here in the Stone, in the best apartments, and
when peace returns to Cairhien, I will see that your estates there
are returned to you, if I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You <em>have</em> been marked.&rdquo; She smiled wryly.
&ldquo;Estates in Cairhien? I may have had estates in those lands, once.
The land has changed so much that nothing is as it was. Selene is
only a name I sometimes use, Lews Therin. The name I made my own is
Lanfear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand barked a shallow laugh. &ldquo;A poor joke, Selene.
I&rsquo;d as soon make jests about the Dark One as one of the Forsaken.
And my name is Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We call ourselves the Chosen,&rdquo; she said calmly.
&ldquo;Chosen to rule the world forever. We <em>will</em> live forever.
You can, also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He frowned at her worriedly. She actually thought she
was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Her travails in reaching Tear must have unhinged her. But
she did not look mad. She was calm, cool, certain. Without
thinking, he found himself reaching for <em>saidin</em>. He reached
for it&mdash;and struck a wall he could not see or feel, except
that it kept him from the Source. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be.&rdquo; She smiled.
&ldquo;Light,&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;You <em>are</em> one of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slowly, he backed away. If he reached <em>
Callandor</em>, at least he would have a weapon. Perhaps it could
not work as a <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>, but it would do for a sword.
Could he use a sword against a woman, against Selene? No, against
Lanfear, against one of the Forsaken.</p>

<p>His back came up hard against something, and he
looked around to see what it was. There was nothing there. A wall
of nothing, with his back pressed against it. <em>Callandor</em>
glittered not three paces away&mdash;on the other side. He thumped
a fist against the barrier in frustration; it was as unyielding as
rock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot trust you fully, Lews Therin. Not yet.&rdquo; She
came closer, and he considered simply seizing her. He was bigger
and stronger by far&mdash;and blocked as he was, she could wrap
him up with the Power like a kitten tangled in a ball of string.
&ldquo;Not with that, certainly,&rdquo; she added, grimacing at <em>
Callandor</em>. &ldquo;There are only two more powerful that a man can
use. One at least, I know, still exists. No, Lews Therin. I will
not trust you yet with that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop calling me that,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;My name is Rand.
Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are Lews Therin Telamon. Oh, physically, nothing
is the same except your height, but I would know who is behind
those eyes even if I&rsquo;d found you in your cradle.&rdquo; She laughed
suddenly. &ldquo;How much easier everything would be if I had found you
then. If I had been free to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Laughter faded into an angry
stare. &ldquo;Do you wish to see my true appearance? You can&rsquo;t remember
that, either, can you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He tried to say no, but his tongue would not work.
Once he had seen two of the Forsaken together, Aginor and
Balthamel, the first two loosed, after three thousand years trapped
just beneath the seal on the Dark One&rsquo;s prison. The one had been
more withered than anything could be and still live; the other hid
his face behind a mask, hid every bit of his flesh as though he
could not bear to see it or have it seen.</p>

<p>The air rippled around Lanfear, and she changed. She
was&mdash;older than he, certainly, but older was not the right
word. More mature. Riper. Even more beautiful, if that was
possible. A lush blossom in full flower compared to a bud. Even
knowing what she was, she made his mouth go dry, his throat
tighten.</p>

<p>Her dark eyes examined his face, full of confidence
yet with a hint of questioning, as if wondering what he saw.
Whatever she perceived seemed to satisfy her. She smiled again. &ldquo;I
was buried deeply, in a dreamless sleep where time did not flow.
The turnings of the Wheel passed me by. Now you see me as I am, and
I have you in my hands.&rdquo; She drew a fingernail along his jaw hard
enough to make him flinch. &ldquo;The time for games and subterfuge is
past, Lews Therin. Long past.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His stomach lurched. &ldquo;Do you mean to kill me, then?
The Light burn you, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kill you?&rdquo; she spat incredulously. &ldquo;Kill you! I mean
to have you, forever. You were mine long before that pale-haired
milksop stole you. Before she ever saw you. You loved me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you loved power!&rdquo; For a moment he felt dazed.
The words sounded true&mdash;he knew they were true&mdash;but
where had they come from?</p>

<p>Selene&mdash;Lanfear&mdash;seemed as startled as
he, but she recovered quickly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve learned much&mdash;you have
done much I&rsquo;d not have believed you could, unaided&mdash;but you
are still fumbling your way through a maze in the dark, and your
ignorance may kill you. Some of the others fear you too much to
wait. Sammael, Rahvin, Moghedien. Others, perhaps, but those of a
certainty. They will come after you. They will not try to turn your
heart. They will come at you by stealth, destroy you while you
sleep. Because of their fear. But there are those who could teach
you, show you what you once knew. None would dare oppose you
then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Teach me? You want me to let one of the Forsaken
teach me?&rdquo; One of the Forsaken. A male Forsaken. A man who had been
Aes Sedai in the Age of Legends, who knew the ways of channeling,
knew how to avoid the pitfalls, knew&mdash;As much had been
offered him before. &ldquo;No! Even if it was offered, I&rsquo;d refuse, and
why should it be? I oppose them&mdash;and you! I hate everything
you&rsquo;ve done, everything you stand for.&rdquo; <em>Fool!</em> he thought.
<em>Trapped here, and I spout defiance like some idiot in a story
who never suspects he might make his captor angry enough to do
something about it</em>. But he could not force himself to take the
words back. Stubbornly, he plowed ahead and made it worse. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
destroy you, if I can. You, and the Dark One, and every last
Forsaken!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A dangerous gleam flashed in her eyes and was gone.
&ldquo;Do you know why some of us fear you? Do you have any idea? Because
they are afraid the Great Lord of the Dark will give you a place
above them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand surprised himself by managing a laugh. &ldquo;Great
Lord of the Dark? Can&rsquo;t you say his true name, either? Surely you
don&rsquo;t fear to attract his attention, as decent people do. Or do
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be blasphemy,&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;They are
right to be afraid, Sammael and the rest. The Great Lord does want
you. He wants to exalt you above all other men. He told me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s ridiculous! The Dark One is still bound in
Shayol Ghul, or I would be fighting Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don right now. And
if he knows I exist, he&rsquo;d want me dead. I mean to fight him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he knows. The Great Lord knows more than you
would suspect. It <em>is</em> possible to talk with him. Go to
Shayol Ghul, into the Pit of Doom, and you can&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;hear him. You
can&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;bathe in his presence.&rdquo; A different light shone on her
face, now. Ecstasy. She breathed through parted lips, and for a
moment seemed to stare at something distant and wondrous. &ldquo;Words
cannot even begin to describe it. You must experience it to know.
You must.&rdquo; She was seeing his face again, with eyes large and dark
and insistent. &ldquo;Kneel to the Great Lord, and he will set you above
all others. He will leave you free to reign as you will, so long as
you bend knee to him only once. To acknowledge him. No more than
that. He told me this. Asmodean will teach you to wield the Power
without it killing you, teach what you can do with it. Let me help
you. We can destroy the others. The Great Lord will not care. We
can destroy all of them, even Asmodean, once he has taught you all
you need to know. You and I can rule the world together under the
Great Lord, forever.&rdquo; Her voice dropped to a whisper, equal parts
eagerness and fear. &ldquo;Two great <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em> were made just
before the end, one that you can use, one that I can. Far greater
than that sword. Their power is beyond imagining. With those, we
could challenge even&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the Great Lord himself. Even the
Creator!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are mad,&rdquo; he said raggedly. &ldquo;The Father of Lies
says he will leave me free? I was born to fight him. That is why I
am here, to fulfill the Prophecies. I&rsquo;ll fight him, and all of you,
until the Last Battle! Until my last breath!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not have to. Prophecy is no more than the
sign of what people hope for. Fulfilling the Prophecies will only
bind you to a path leading to Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don and your death.
Moghedien or Sammael can destroy your body. The Great Lord of the
Dark can destroy your soul. An end utter and complete. You will
never be born again no matter how long the Wheel of Time
turns!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For what seemed a long time she studied him; he could
almost see the scales weighing alternatives. &ldquo;I could take you with
me,&rdquo; she said finally. &ldquo;I could have you turned to the Great Lord
whatever you want or believe. There are ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She paused, perhaps to see if her words had had any
effect. Sweat rolled down his back, but he kept his face straight.
He would have to do something, whether he had a chance or not. A
second attempt to reach <em>saidin</em> battered vainly against
that invisible barrier. He let his eyes wander as if he were
thinking. <em>Callandor</em> was behind him, as far out of reach as
the other side of the Aryth Ocean. His belt knife lay on a table by
the bed, together with a half-made fox he had been carving. The
shapeless lumps of metal mocking him from above the fireplace, a
drably clad man slipping in at the doors with a knife in his hand,
the books lying everywhere. He turned back to Lanfear, tensing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were always stubborn,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t
take you, this time. I want you to come to me of your own will. And
I will have it. What is the matter? You&rsquo;re frowning.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>A man slipping in at the doors with a knife</em>;
his eyes had slid past the fellow almost without seeing.
Instinctively he pushed Lanfear out of the way and reached for the
True Source; the shield blocking him vanished as he touched it, and
his sword was in his hands like a red-gold flame. The man rushed at
him, knife held low and point up for a killing stroke. Even then it
was difficult to keep his eyes on the fellow, but Rand pivoted
smoothly, and The Wind Blows Over the Wall took off the hand
holding the knife and finished by driving through his assailant&rsquo;s
heart. For an instant he stared into dull eyes&mdash;lifeless
while that heart still pumped&mdash;then pulled his blade
free.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Gray Man.&rdquo; Rand took what felt like his first
breath in hours. The corpse at his feet was messy, bleeding onto
the scroll-worked carpet, but there was no difficulty in fixing an
eye on him now. It was always that way with the Shadow&rsquo;s assassins;
when they were noticed, it was usually too late. &ldquo;This makes no
sense. You could have killed me easily. Why distract me for a Gray
Man to sneak up on me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lanfear was watching him warily. &ldquo;I make no use of
the Soulless. I told you there are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;differences among the
Chosen. It seems I was a day late in my judgment, but there is
still time for you to come with me. To learn. To live. That sword,&rdquo;
she all but sneered. &ldquo;You do not do the tenth part of what you can.
Come with me, and learn. Or do you mean to try to kill me, now? I
loosed you to defend yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her voice, her stance, said she expected an attack,
or at the very least was ready to counter it, but that was not what
stopped him, any more than her loosing the bonds in the first
place. She was one of the Forsaken; she had served evil so long she
made a Black sister look like a newborn babe. Yet he saw a woman.
He called himself nine kinds of fool, but he could not do it. Maybe
if she tried to kill him. Maybe. But all she did was stand there,
watching, waiting. No doubt ready to do things with the Power he
did not even know were possible, if he attempted to hold her. He
had managed to block Elayne and Egwene, but that had been one of
those things he did without thinking, the way of it buried
somewhere in his head. He could only remember that he had done it,
not how. At least he had a firm grip on <em>saidin</em>; she would
not surprise him that way again. The stomach-wrenching taint was
nothing; <em>saidin</em> was life, perhaps in more ways than
one.</p>

<p>A sudden thought boiled up in his head like a hot
spring. The Aiel. Even a Gray Man should have found it impossible
to sneak through doors watched by half a dozen Aiel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you do to them?&rdquo; His voice grated as he
backed toward the doors, keeping his eyes on her. If she used the
Power, maybe he would have some warning. &ldquo;What did you do to the
Aiel outside?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she replied coolly. &ldquo;Do not go out there.
This may be only a testing to see how vulnerable you are, but even
a testing may kill you if you are a fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He flung open the left-hand door onto a scene of
madness.</p>
