<h4><em>Cold Rocks Hold</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">F</span>rowning,
Rand looked around. A mile ahead stood a
tight cluster of tall, sheer-sided buttes, or perhaps one huge
butte broken by fissures. To his left the land ran off in patches
of tough grass and leafless spiny plants, scattered thorny bushes
and low trees, across arid hills and jagged gullies, past huge,
rough stone columns to jagged mountains in the distance. To the
right the land was the same, except the cracked yellowish clay lay
flatter, the mountains closer. It could have been any piece of the
Waste he had seen since leaving Chaendaer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Rhuarc glanced at Aviendha, who was looking at Rand
as though he had lost his wits. &ldquo;Come. Let your own eyes show you
Cold Rocks.&rdquo; Dropping his <em>shoufa</em> to his shoulders, the
clan chief turned and loped bareheaded toward the fissured rock
wall ahead.</p>

<p>The Shaido had already halted, milling about and
beginning to set up their tents. Heirn and the Jindo fell in behind
Rhuarc at a trot with their pack mules, uncovering their heads and
shouting wordlessly, and the Maidens escorting the peddlers cried
for the drivers to hasten their teams and follow the Jindo. One of
the Wise Ones lifted her skirts to her knees and ran to join Rhuarc&mdash;Rand thought it was Amys, from the pale hair; surely Bair
could not move that nimbly&mdash;but the rest of the Wise Ones&rsquo;
party maintained its original pace. For a moment Moiraine looked as
if she would break away, toward Rand, then hesitated, arguing with
one of the other Wise Ones, hair still hidden by her shawl. Finally
the Aes Sedai reined her white mare back beside Egwene&rsquo;s gray and
Lan&rsquo;s black stallion, just ahead of the white-robed <em>
gai&rsquo;shain</em> who were tugging the pack animals along. They were
heading the same way as Rhuarc and the others, though.</p>

<p>Rand leaned down to offer a hand to Aviendha. When
she shook her head, he said, &ldquo;If they are going to be making all
that noise, I won&rsquo;t be able to hear you down there. What if I make
a wool-headed mistake because I can&rsquo;t hear what you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Muttering under her breath, she glanced at the
Maidens around the peddlers&rsquo; wagons, then sighed and clasped his
arm. He hoisted her up, ignoring her indignant squawk, and swung
her onto Jeade&rsquo;en behind the saddle. Whenever she tried to mount by
herself, she came close to pulling him out of the saddle. He gave
her a moment to settle her heavy skirts, though at best they bared
her legs well above her soft, knee-high boots, then heeled the
dapple to a canter. It was the first time Aviendha had ridden
faster than a walk; she flung her arms around his waist and hung
on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you make me look the fool before my sisters,
wetlander,&rdquo; she snarled warningly against his back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why would they think you a fool? I&rsquo;ve seen Bair and
Amys and the others ride behind Moiraine or Egwene sometimes to
talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a moment, she said, &ldquo;You accept changes more
easily than I, Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo; He was not sure what to make of
that.</p>

<p>When he brought Jeade&rsquo;en up with Rhuarc and Heirn and
Amys, a little ahead of the still shouting Jindo, he was surprised
to see Couladin running easily alongside, flame-colored hair bare.
Aviendha tugged Rand&rsquo;s own <em>shoufa</em> down to his shoulders.
&ldquo;You must enter a hold with your face clear to be seen. I told you
that. And make noise. We have been seen long since, and they will
know who we are, but it is customary, to show you are not trying to
take the hold by surprise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He nodded, but held his tongue. Neither Rhuarc nor
any of the three with him were making a sound, and neither was
Aviendha. Besides, the Jindo made enough clamor to be heard for
miles.</p>

<p>Couladin&rsquo;s head swung toward him. Contempt flashed
across that sun-dark face, and something else. Hate and disdain
Rand had come to expect, but amusement? What did Couladin find
amusing?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fool Shaido,&rdquo; Aviendha muttered at his back. Maybe
she was right; maybe the amusement was for her riding. But Rand did
not think so.</p>

<p>Mat galloped up trailing a cloud of yellowish brown
dust, hat pulled low and spear resting upright on his stirrup iron
like a lance. &ldquo;What is this place, Rand?&rdquo; he asked loudly, to be
heard over the shouts. &ldquo;All those women would say was &lsquo;Move faster.
Move faster.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; Rand told him, and he frowned at the towering rock
face of the butte. &ldquo;You could hold that thing for years, I suppose,
with supplies, but it isn&rsquo;t a patch on the Stone, or the Tora
Harad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Tora what?&rdquo; Rand said.</p>

<p>Mat rolled his shoulders before answering. &ldquo;Just
something I heard of, once.&rdquo; He stood in his stirrups to peer back
over the heads of the Jindo toward the peddlers&rsquo; train. &ldquo;At least
they&rsquo;re still with us. I wonder how long before they finish trading
and go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not before Alcair Dal. Rhuarc says there&rsquo;s a sort of
fair whenever clan chiefs meet, even if it&rsquo;s only two or three.
With all twelve coming, I don&rsquo;t think Kadere and Keille will want
to miss it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat did not look pleased at the news.</p>

<p>Rhuarc led the way straight to the widest fissure in
the sheer stone wall, ten or twelve paces across at the broadest,
and shadowed by the height of its sheer sides as it wove deeper and
deeper, dark and even cool beneath a ribbon of sky. It felt odd to
be in so much shade. The Aiels&rsquo; wordless shouts swelled, magnified
between the gray-brown walls; when they suddenly ceased, the
silence, broken only by the clatter of mules&rsquo; hooves and the creak
of wagon wheels far behind, seemed very loud.</p>

<p>They rounded another curve, and the fissure opened
abruptly into a wide canyon, long and almost straight. From every
side, shrill ululating cries broke from hundreds of women&rsquo;s mouths.
A thick crowd lined the way, women in bulky skirts, shawls wrapped
about their heads, and men wearing grayish brown coats and
breeches, the <em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em>, and Maidens of the Spear, too,
waving their arms in welcome, beating on pots or whatever could
make a noise.</p>

<p>Rand gaped, and not just for the pandemonium. The
canyon walls were green, in narrow terraces climbing halfway up
both sides. Not all were really terraces, he realized. Small,
flat-roofed houses of gray stone or yellow clay seemed to be
stacked practically atop one another, in clusters with paths
winding between, and every roof a garden of beans and squashes,
peppers and melons and plants he did not know. Chickens ran loose,
redder than those he knew, and some strange sort of fowl, larger
and speckled gray. Children, most garbed like their elders, and
white-robed <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> moved among the rows with big clay
pitchers, apparently watering individual plants. The Aiel did not
have cities, he had always been told, but this was certainly a
fair-sized town at least, if as odd a one as he had ever seen. The
din was too great for him to ask any of the questions that popped
into his head&mdash;such as, what were those round fruits, too red
and shiny for apples, growing on low, pale-leafed bushes, or those
straight, broad-leafed stalks lined with long, fat, yellow-tasseled
sprouts? He had been too long a farmer not to wonder.</p>

<p>Rhuarc and Heirn slowed, and so did Couladin, but
only to a quick walk, thrusting their spears through the bow-case
harnesses on their backs. Amys ran on ahead, laughing like a girl,
while the men continued their steady advance along the crowd-lined
canyon floor, the cries of the hold&rsquo;s women vibrating in the air
and nearly overshadowing the clanging of pots. Rand followed, as
Aviendha had told him to. Mat looked as if he wanted to turn around
and ride right back out again.</p>

<p>At the far end of the canyon, the wall leaned inward,
making a deep, dark pocket. The sun never reached to the back of
it, so Aviendha had said, and the rocks there, always cool, gave
the hold its name. In front of the shadows, Amys stood with another
woman atop a wide gray boulder, its top smoothed for a
platform.</p>

<p>The second woman, slender in her bulky skirts,
scarf-bound yellow hair spilling below her waist and touched with
white from her temples, appeared older than Amys though certainly
more than handsome, with a few fine wrinkles at the corners of her
gray eyes. She was dressed the same as Amys, a plain brown shawl
over her shoulders, her necklaces and bracelets of gold and carved
ivory no finer or richer, but this was Lian, the roofmistress of
Cold Rocks Hold.</p>

<p>The wavering, high-pitched cries dwindled away to
nothing as Rhuarc halted before the boulder, a step closer than
Heirn and Couladin. &ldquo;I ask leave enter your hold, roofmistress,&rdquo; he
announced in a loud, carrying tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have my leave, clan chief,&rdquo; the yellow-haired
woman replied formally, and just as loudly. Smiling, she added in a
much warmer voice, &ldquo;Shade of my heart, you will always have my
leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I give thanks, roofmistress of my heart.&rdquo; That did
not sound particularly formal, either.</p>

<p>Heirn stepped forward. &ldquo;Roofmistress, I ask leave to
come beneath your roof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have my leave, Heirn,&rdquo; Lian told the stocky man.
&ldquo;Beneath my roof, there is water and shade for you. The Jindo sept
is always welcome here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I give thanks, roofmistress.&rdquo; Heirn clapped Rhuarc
on the shoulder and left to rejoin his people; Aiel ceremony was
short, it seemed, and to the point.</p>

<p>Swaggering, Couladin joined Rhuarc, &ldquo;I ask leave to
enter your hold, roofmistress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lian blinked, frowning at him. A murmur rose behind
Rand, an astonished buzz from hundreds of throats. A sudden feel of
danger hung in the air. Mat certainly felt it, too, fingering his
spear and half-turning to see what the mass of Aiel was doing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; Rand asked quietly over his
shoulder. &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t she say something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He asked as if he were a clan chief,&rdquo; Aviendha
whispered disbelievingly. &ldquo;The man <em>is</em> a fool. He must be
mad! If she refuses him, it will mean trouble with the Shaido, and
she may, for such an insult. Not blood feud&mdash;he is not their
clan chief, however swollen his head&mdash;but trouble.&rdquo; Between
one breath and the next her voice sharpened. &ldquo;You did not listen,
did you? You did not listen! She could have refused permission even
to Rhuarc, and he would have had to leave. It would break the clan,
but it is in her power. She can refuse even He Who Comes With the
Dawn, Rand al&rsquo;Thor. Women are not powerless among us, not like your
wetlander women who must be queens or nobles or else dance for a
man if they wish to eat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shook his head slightly. Every time he was on the
point of berating himself for how little he had learned about the
Aiel, Aviendha reminded him how little she knew about anyone not
Aiel. &ldquo;Someday I would like to introduce you to the Women&rsquo;s Circle
in Emond&rsquo;s Field. It will be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;interesting&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to hear you
explain to them how powerless they are.&rdquo; He felt her shifting
against his back, trying to get a good look at his face, and
carefully kept his expression smooth. &ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;ll explain a few
things to you, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have my leave,&rdquo; Lian began&mdash;Couladin
smiled, swelling up where he stood&mdash;&rdquo;to step beneath my roof.
Water and shade will be found for you.&rdquo; Soft gasps from hundreds of
mouths made quite a loud sound.</p>

<p>The fire-haired man quivered as if struck, face red
with rage. He did not seem to know what to do. He took a
challenging step forward, staring up at Lian and Amys, clutching
his own forearms as though to keep his hands from his spears, then
whirled and strode back toward the gathering, glaring this way and
that, daring anyone to speak. Finally he stopped not far from where
he had begun, staring at Rand. Coals could not have been hotter
than his blue eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As one friendless and alone,&rdquo; Aviendha whispered.
&ldquo;She has welcomed him as a beggar. The gravest insult to him, and
none to the Shaido.&rdquo; Suddenly she fisted Rand so hard in the ribs
that he grunted. &ldquo;Move, wetlander. You hold such honor as I have
left in your hands; all will know I have taught you! Move!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Swinging a leg over, he slid from Jeade&rsquo;en&rsquo;s back and
strode up beside Rhuarc. <em>I am not Aiel</em>, he thought. <em>I
do not understand them, and I cannot let myself come to like them
too much. I cannot</em>.</p>

<p>None of the other men had done so, but he bowed to
Lian; that was how he had been brought up. &ldquo;Roofmistress, I ask
leave to come beneath your roof.&rdquo; He heard Aviendha&rsquo;s breath catch.
He had been supposed to say the other thing, what Rhuarc had. The
clan chief&rsquo;s eyes narrowed worriedly, watching his wife, and
Couladin&rsquo;s flushed face twisted in a scornful smile. The soft
murmurs from the crowd sounded puzzled.</p>

<p>The roofmistress stared at Rand even harder than she
had at Couladin, taking him in from hair to boots and back again,
the <em>shoufa</em> lying on the shoulders of a red coat that would
surely never be worn by an Aiel. She looked questioningly at Amys,
who nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such modesty,&rdquo; Lian said slowly, &ldquo;is becoming in a
man. Men seldom know where to find it.&rdquo; Spreading her dark skirts,
she curtsied, awkwardly&mdash;it was not a thing Aiel women did&mdash;but still a curtsy, in return of his bow. &ldquo;The <em>
Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> has leave to enter my hold. For the chief of
chiefs, there is ever water and shade at Cold Rocks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another great ululation rose from the women in the
crowd, but whether for him or for the ceremony, Rand did not know.
Couladin paused to stare implacable hatred at him, then stalked
off, brushing roughly past Aviendha as she slid ungracefully from
the dapple stallion. He melded quickly into the dispersing
crowd.</p>

<p>Mat slowed in the act of dismounting to stare after
the man. &ldquo;Watch your back with that one, Rand,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;I
mean it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everybody tells me that,&rdquo; Rand said. The peddlers
were already setting up to trade in the center of the canyon, and
at the entrance, Moiraine and the rest of the Wise Ones&rsquo; company
were arriving to a few shouts and the drumming of pots, but nothing
like the cries that had welcomed Rhuarc. &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t who I have to
worry about.&rdquo; His dangers were not Aiel. <em>Moiraine to one side
and Lanfear to the other. How could I have more danger than
that?</em> It was nearly enough to make him laugh.</p>

<p>Amys and Lian had climbed down, and to Rand&rsquo;s
surprise, Rhuarc put an arm around each of them. They were both
tall, as most Aiel women seemed to be, but neither came higher than
the clan chief&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;You have met my wife Amys,&rdquo; he said to
Rand. &ldquo;Now you must meet my wife Lian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand realized his mouth was hanging open and closed
it quickly. After Aviendha had told him the roofmistress of Cold
Rocks was Rhuarc&rsquo;s wife and named Lian, he was sure he had
misunderstood back at Chaendaer, all that &ldquo;shade of my heart&rdquo;
between the man and Amys. He had had other things on his mind then
anyway. But this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Both</em> of them?&rdquo; Mat spluttered. &ldquo;Light! Two!
Oh, burn me! He&rsquo;s the luckiest man in the world or the biggest fool
since creation!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had thought,&rdquo; Rhuarc said, frowning, &ldquo;that
Aviendha was teaching you our customs. She leaves out much, it
appears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leaning to look around her husband&mdash;<em>
their</em> husband&mdash;Lian raised an eyebrow at Amys, who said
dryly, &ldquo;She seemed ideal to tell him what he needs to know.
Something to keep her from trying to run back to the Maidens
whenever our backs were turned, too. Now it seems I must have a
long talk with her in a quiet place. No doubt she has been teaching
him Maiden hand talk, or how to milk a <em>gara</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flushing slightly, Aviendha tossed her head
irritably; her dark reddish hair had grown over her ears, long
enough to sway in a fringe below her head scarf. &ldquo;There were more
important matters to speak of than marriages. Anyway, the man does
not listen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has been a good teacher,&rdquo; Rand put in quickly.
&ldquo;I have learned a great deal about your customs, and the Threefold
Land, from her.&rdquo; Hand talk? &ldquo;Any mistakes I make are mine, not
hers.&rdquo; How did you milk a venomous two-foot lizard? Why? &ldquo;She has
been a good teacher, and I&rsquo;d like to keep her as such, if that is
all right.&rdquo; <em>Why in the Light did I say that?</em> The woman
could be pleasant enough sometimes, when she forget herself,
anyway; the rest of the time she was a burr under his coat. Yet at
least he knew who the Wise Ones had set to watch him as long as she
was there.</p>

<p>Amys studied him, those clear blue eyes as sharp as
an Aes Sedai&rsquo;s. But then, she could channel; her face merely looked
younger than it should, not ageless, but maybe she was as much Aes
Sedai as an Aes Sedai. &ldquo;That sounds a fine arrangement to me,&rdquo; she
said. Aviendha opened her mouth, all bristling indignation&mdash;and closed it again, sullenly, when the Wise One shifted that stare
to her. Perhaps the woman had thought her time with him was done,
now they had reached Cold Rocks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be tired after your journey,&rdquo; Lian said to
Rand, her gray eyes motherly, &ldquo;and hungry as well. Come.&rdquo; Her warm
smile included Mat, who was hanging back and beginning to look to
the peddlers&rsquo; wagons. &ldquo;Come beneath my roof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fetching his saddlebags, Rand left Jeade&rsquo;en to the
care of a <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> woman, who took Pips as well. Mat gave
the wagons a final stare before tossing his saddlebags over his
shoulder and following.</p>

<p>Lian&rsquo;s roof, her house, sat on the highest level on
the west side, with the steep canyon wall rising a good hundred
paces above. Dwelling of the clan chief and roofmistress or no,
from the outside it appeared to be a modest rectangle of large
yellow-clay bricks with narrow, glassless windows covered by plain
white curtains, a vegetable garden on its flat roof and another in
front on a small terrace separated from the house by a narrow path
paved with flat gray stones. Big enough for two rooms, maybe.
Except perhaps for the square bronze gong hanging beside the door,
it looked much like the other structures Rand could see, and from
that vantage point the entire length of the valley was laid out
below him. A small, simple house. Inside, it was something
else.</p>

<p>The brick part was one large room, floored with
reddish brown tiles, but it was only part. Carved into the stone
behind were more rooms, high-ceilinged and surprisingly cool, with
wide, arched doorways and silver lamps giving off a scent that
hinted of green places. Rand saw only one chair, tall-backed and
lacquered red and gold, with a look of not much use; the chief&rsquo;s
chair, Aviendha called it. There was little more wood to be seen,
beyond a few polished or lacquered boxes and chests, and low
reading stands holding open books; the reader would need to lie on
the floor. Intricately woven carpets covered the floors, and bright
rugs in layers; he recognized some patterns from Tear and Cairhien
and Andor, even Illian and Tarabon, while other designs were
unfamiliar, broad jagged stripes and no two colors alike, or linked
hollow squares in grays and browns and blacks. In sharp contrast to
the harsh sameness outside this valley, there was vivid color
everywhere, wall hangings he was sure had come from the other side of
the Spine of the World&mdash;perhaps in the same way wall hangings
had left the Stone of Tear&mdash;and cushions of all sizes and
hues, often tasseled or fringed or both in silk of red or gold.
Here and there, in niches carved into the walls, stood a thin
porcelain vase or a silver bowl or an ivory carving, often of some
strange animal or other. So these were the &ldquo;caves&rdquo; the Tairens
spoke of. It could have had the garishness of Tear&mdash;or the
Tinkers&mdash;but instead it seemed dignified, formal and informal
at the same time.</p>

<p>With a small grin for Aviendha to show her he <em>
had</em> listened, Rand pulled a guest gift for Lian from his
saddlebags, a finely worked golden lion. It had been looted from
Tear and bought from a Jindo Water Seeker, but if he was ruler of
Tear, maybe it was like stealing from himself. After a moment of
hesitation, Mat produced a gift, too, a Tairen necklace of silver
flowers, no doubt from the same source originally, and no doubt
intended for Isendre.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exquisite,&rdquo; Lian smiled, holding up the lion. &ldquo;I
have always had a taste for Tairen craftwork. Rhuarc brought me two
pieces many years ago.&rdquo; In a voice suitable for a goodwife
reminiscing over some particularly fine sugarberries, she said to
her husband, &ldquo;You took them from the tent of a High Lord just
before Laman was beheaded, did you not? A pity you did not reach
Andor. I have always wanted a piece of Andoran silver. This
necklace is beautiful, too, Mat Cauthon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Listening to her heap praise on both gifts, Rand
masked his shock. For all her skirts and motherly eyes, she was as
Aiel as any Maiden of the Spear.</p>

<p>By the time Lian finished, Moiraine and the other
Wise Ones arrived with Lan and Egwene. The Warder&rsquo;s sword drew a
single disapproving glance, but the roofmistress welcomed him
warmly after Bair called him <em>Aan&rsquo;allein</em>. Yet that was
nothing to her greeting for Egwene and Moiraine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You honor my roof, Aes Sedai.&rdquo; The roof mistress&rsquo;s
tone made it sound an understatement; she came very close to bowing
to them. &ldquo;It is said that we served Aes Sedai before the Breaking
of the World and failed them, and for that failure were sent here
to the Three-fold Land. Your presence says that perhaps our sin was
not beyond forgiving.&rdquo; Of course. She had not been to Rhuidean;
apparently the prohibition against speaking of what happened in
Rhuidean with anyone who had not been there applied even between
husband and wife. And between sister-wives, or whatever the
relationship was between Amys and Lian.</p>

<p>Moiraine tried to give Lian a guest gift, too, tiny
crystal-and-silver flasks of scent all the way from Arad Doman, but
Lian spread her hands. &ldquo;Your very presence is guest gift beyond
value, Aes Sedai. To accept more would dishonor my roof, and me. I
could not bear the shame.&rdquo; She sounded entirely serious, and
troubled that Moiraine might press the scent on her. It was an
indication of the relative importance of the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>
and an Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you wish,&rdquo; Moiraine said, returning the flasks to
her belt pouch. She was icily serene in blue silk, her pale cloak
thrown back. &ldquo;Your Three-fold Land will surely see more Aes Sedai.
We have never had reason to come, before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amys did not look best pleased over that at all, and
flame-haired Melaine stared at Moiraine like a green-eyed cat
wondering if she should do something about a large dog that had
wandered into her barnyard. Bair and Seana exchanged troubled
glances, but nothing like the two who could channel.</p>

<p>A flurry of <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>&mdash;men and women
alike graceful in cowled white robes, their downcast eyes seeming
so strangely submissive in Aiel faces&mdash;took Moiraine and
Egwene&rsquo;s cloaks, brought damp towels for hands and faces, and tiny
silver cups of water to be drunk formally, and finally a meal,
served with silver bowls and trays fit for a palace yet eaten from
pottery with a blue-striped glaze. Everyone ate lying on the floor,
where white tiles had been set into the stone for a table, heads
together, cushions under their chests, radiating out like spokes in
a wheel while <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> slipped between to place
dishes.</p>

<p>Mat struggled, shifting this way and that on his
cushions, but Lan lounged as if he had always eaten that way, and
Moiraine and Egwene looked almost as comfortable. No doubt they had
had practice in the Wise Ones&rsquo; tents. Rand found it awkward, yet
the food itself was peculiar enough to take most of his
attention.</p>

<p>A dark, spicy stew of goat with chopped peppers was
unfamiliar but hardly strange, and peas were peas anywhere, or
squash. The same could not be said of the crumbly, coarse yellow
bread, or long, bright red beans mixed in with the green, or a dish
of bright yellow kernels and bits of pulpy red that Aviendha called
<em>zemai</em> and <em>t&rsquo;mat</em>, or a sweet, bulbous fruit with a
tough greenish skin she said came from one of those leafless, spiny
plants called <em>kardon</em>. It was all tasty, though.</p>

<p>He might have enjoyed the meal more if she had not
lectured him on everything. Not sister-wives. That was left to Amys
and Lian, lying on either side of Rhuarc and smiling at each other
almost as much as at their husband. If they had both married him so
as not to break up their friendship, it was plain they both loved
him. Rand could not see Elayne and Min agreeing to such an
agreement; he wondered why he had even thought of it. The sun must
have cooked his brains.</p>

<p>But if Aviendha left that one explanation to others,
she explained <em>everything</em> else in tooth-grinding detail.
Maybe she thought him an idiot for not knowing about sister-wives.
Turned on her right side to face him, she smiled almost sweetly as
she told him the spoon could be used for eating the stew or the
<em>zemai</em> and <em>t&rsquo;mat</em>, but her eyes shone with a light
that said it was the Wise Ones being there that kept her from
hurling a bowl of something at his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know what I&rsquo;ve done to you,&rdquo; he said
quietly. He was very conscious of Melaine on his other side,
seeming engrossed in her own low conversation with Seana. Bair put
in a word now and then, but he thought she was bending an ear his
way, too. &ldquo;But if you hate being my teacher so much, you do not
have to be. It just popped out. I&rsquo;m sure Rhuarc or the Wise Ones
will find someone else.&rdquo; The Wise Ones certainly would, if he rid
himself of this spy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have done nothing to me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She bared teeth
at him; if it was meant to be a smile, it fell considerably short.
&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and you never will. You may lie however is most comfortable
for eating, and talk to those around you. Except for those of us
who must instruct instead of sharing the meal, of course. It is
considered polite to talk with those on both sides.&rdquo; From behind
her, Mat looked at Rand and rolled his eyes, clearly relieved to be
spared that. &ldquo;Unless you are forced to face one in particular, as
to teach him. Take food with your right hand&mdash;unless you must
lean on that elbow&mdash;and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was torture, and she seemed to enjoy it. The Aiel
seemed to set great store by the giving of gifts. Maybe if he gave
her a gift&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;all talk for a time when the meal is done,
unless one of us must teach instead, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>A bribe</em>. It did not seem fair to have to
bribe someone who was spying on him, but if she meant to go on even
half like this, it would be worth it for a little peace.</p>

<p>When the meal was cleared away by <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>,
and silver cups of dark wine brought, Bair fixed Aviendha with a
grim eye across the white tiles, and she subsided sulkily. Egwene
knelt up to reach over Mat and pat her, but it did not appear to
help. At least she was quiet. Egwene gave him a tight look; either
she knew what he was thinking or she considered Aviendha&rsquo;s sulks
his fault.</p>

<p>Rhuarc dug out his short-stemmed pipe and tabac
pouch, thumbing the bowl full then passing the leather pouch to
Mat, who had produced his own silver-mounted pipe. &ldquo;Some have taken
news of you to heart, Rand al&rsquo;Thor, and quickly it seems. Lian
tells me word has come that Jheran, who is clan chief of the
Shaarad Aiel, and Bael, of the Goshien, have already reached Alcair
Dal. Erim, of the Chareen, is on his way.&rdquo; He allowed a slender
young <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> woman to light his pipe with a burning
twig. From the way she moved, with a different sort of grace than
the other white-robed men and women, Rand suspected she had been a
Maiden of the Spear not too long ago. He wondered how long she had
to continue in her year and a day of service, meek and humble.</p>

<p>Mat grinned at the woman as she knelt to light his
pipe; the green-eyed stare she gave him from the depths of her cowl
was not meek at all, and wiped the grin right off his face.
Irritably, he rolled onto his belly, a thin blue streamer rising
from his pipe. It was too bad he did not see the satisfaction on
her face, or see it wiped away in a blush by one glance from Amys;
the green-eyed young woman scurried away looking shamed beyond
belief. And Aviendha, who so hated having had to give up the spear,
who still saw herself as spear-sister to a Maiden of whatever clan&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? She frowned at the departing <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> as Mistress
al&rsquo;Vere would have glared at someone who had spit on the floor. A
strange people. Egwene was the only one Rand saw with any sympathy
in her eyes at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Goshien and the Shaarad,&rdquo; he muttered at his
wine. Rhuarc had told him each clan chief would bring a few
warriors to the Golden Bowl, for honor, and each sept chief, as
well. Added together, it meant perhaps a thousand from each clan.
Twelve clans. Twelve thousand men and Maidens, eventually, all tied
up in their strange honor and ready to dance the spears if a cat
sneezed. Maybe more, because of the fair. He looked up. &ldquo;They have
a feud, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; Rhuarc and Lan both nodded. &ldquo;I know you said
that something like the Peace of Rhuidean holds at Alcair
Dal, Rhuarc, but I saw how far that Peace held Couladin and
the Shaido. Maybe I had better go right away. If the Goshien and
the Shaarad start fighting&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;A thing like that could spread. I
want <em>all</em> the Aiel behind me, Rhuarc.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Goshien are not Shaido,&rdquo; Melaine said sharply,
shaking her red-gold mane like a lioness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor are the Shaarad.&rdquo; Bair&rsquo;s reedy voice was thinner
than that of the younger woman, but no less definite. &ldquo;Jheran and
Bael may try to kill one another, before they return to their
holds, but not at Alcair Dal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of which answers Rand al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s question,&rdquo;
Rhuarc said. &ldquo;If you go to Alcair Dal before all of the chiefs
arrive, those who have not come yet will lose honor. It is not a
good way to announce that you are <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>, dishonoring
men you will call to follow you. The Nakai have furthest to come. A
month, and all will be at Alcair Dal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Less,&rdquo; Seana said with a brisk shake of her head. &ldquo;I
have walked Alsera&rsquo;s dreams twice, and she says Bruan means to run
all the way from Shiagi Hold. Less than a month.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A month before you leave, to be sure,&rdquo; Rhuarc told
Rand. &ldquo;Then three days to Alcair Dal. Perhaps four. All will be
there then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A month. He rubbed his chin. Too long. Too long, and
no choice. In stories, things always happened as the hero planned,
seemingly when he wanted them to happen. In real life it rarely
occurred that way, even for a <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> with prophecy
supposedly working for him. In real life it was scratch and hope,
and luck if you found more than half a loaf where you needed a
whole. Yet a part of his plan was following the path he had hoped
for. The most dangerous part.</p>

<p>Moiraine, stretched out between Lan and Amys, sipped
her wine lazily, eyes lidded as if sleepy. He did not believe it.
She saw everything, heard everything. But he had nothing to say now
that she should not hear. &ldquo;How many will resist, Rhuarc? Or oppose
me? You have hinted, but you&rsquo;ve never said for sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot be sure in it,&rdquo; the clan chief replied
around his pipestem. &ldquo;When you show the Dragons, they will know
you. There is no way to imitate the Dragons of Rhuidean.&rdquo; Had
Moiraine&rsquo;s eyes flickered? &ldquo;You are the one prophesied. I will
support you, and Bruan certainly, and Dhearic, of the Reyn Aiel.
The others&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Sevanna, Suladric&rsquo;s wife, will bring the Shaido
since the clan has no chief. She is young to be roofmistress of a
hold, doubtless displeased she will have only one roof and not an
entire hold when someone is chosen to replace Suladric. And Sevanna
is as wily and untrustworthy as any Shaido ever born. But even if
she makes no trouble, you know that Couladin will; he acts the clan
chief, and some Shaido may follow him without his entering
Rhuidean. Shaido are fools enough for that. Han, of the Tomanelle,
may move in any direction. He is a prickly man, hard to know and
difficult to deal with, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He cut off as Lian murmured softly, &ldquo;Is there any
other kind?&rdquo; Rand did not think the clan chief had been meant to
hear. Amys hid a smile behind her hand; her sister-wife buried her
face innocently in her winecup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I was saying,&rdquo; Rhuarc said, frowning resignedly
from one of his wives to the other, &ldquo;it is not a thing I can be
sure of. Most will follow you. Perhaps all. Perhaps even the
Shaido. We have waited three thousand years for the man who bears
two Dragons. When you show your arms, none will doubt you are the
one sent to unite us.&rdquo; And break them; but he did not mention that.
&ldquo;The question is how they will decide to react.&rdquo; He tapped his
teeth with his pipestem for a moment. &ldquo;You will not change your
mind and don the <em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And show them what, Rhuarc? A pretend Aiel? As well
dress Mat for Aiel.&rdquo; Mat choked on his pipe. &ldquo;I will not pretend. I
am what I am; they must take me as I am.&rdquo; Rand raised his fists,
coatsleeves falling enough to uncover the golden-maned heads on the
backs of his wrists. &ldquo;These prove me. If they aren&rsquo;t enough, then
nothing is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where do you mean to &lsquo;lead the spears to war once
more&rsquo;?&rdquo; Moiraine asked suddenly, and Mat choked again, snatching
the pipe out of his mouth and staring at her. Her dark eyes were
not lidded any longer.</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s fists tightened convulsively, till his
knuckles cracked. Trying to be clever with her was dangerous; he
should have learned that long since. She remembered every word that
she heard, filed it away, sorted and examined until she knew just
what it meant.</p>

<p>He got to his feet slowly. They were all watching
him. Egwene frowned even more worriedly than Mat, but the Aiel just
watched. Talk of war did not upset them. Rhuarc looked&mdash;ready. And Moiraine&rsquo;s face was all frozen calm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will excuse me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am going to walk
around awhile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha rose to her knees, and Egwene stood, but
neither followed him.</p>
