<h4><em>Homecoming</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
journey into the Westwood that had taken him
perhaps half a dozen strides or so in the wolf dream, out of the
mountains and across the Sand Hills, lasted three long days on
horses. The Aiel had no trouble keeping up afoot, but then the
animals themselves could not manage much speed with the land mostly
up and down as it was. Perrin&rsquo;s wounds itched fiercely, healing;
Faile&rsquo;s ointment seemed to be working.</p>

<p>It was a quiet journey by and large, broken more
often by the bark of a hunting fox or the echoing cry of a hawk
than by anyone speaking. At least they saw no more ravens. More
than once he thought Faile was about to bring her mare over close
to him, about to say something, but each time she restrained
herself. He was glad of it; he wanted to talk to her more than
anything, but what if he found himself making up with her? He
berated himself for wanting to. She had tricked Loial, tricked him.
She was going to make everything worse; make it harder. He wished
he could kiss her again. He wished she would decide she had had her
fill of him and go. Why did she have to be so stubborn?</p>

<p>She and the two Aiel women kept to themselves, Bain
and Chiad striding along on either side of Swallow when one or the
other was not ranging ahead. Sometimes the three of them murmured
softly among themselves, after which they avoided looking at him so
pointedly that they might as well have thrown rocks. Loial rode
with them at Perrin&rsquo;s request, though the situation obviously upset
him no end. Loial&rsquo;s ears twitched as if he wished he had never
heard of humans. Gaul seemed to find the entire thing vastly
amusing; whenever Perrin looked at him, he wore an inward grin.</p>

<p>For himself, Perrin traveled wrapped in worry, and
kept his strung bow across the tall pommel of his saddle. Did this
man called Slayer rove the Two Rivers only in the wolf dream, or
was he in the waking world, too? Perrin suspected the latter, and
that Slayer was the one who had shot the hawk for no reason. It was
another complication he could do without, on top of the Children of
the Light.</p>

<p>His family lived on a sprawling farm more than half a
day beyond Emond&rsquo;s Field, almost to the Waterwood. His father and
mother, his sisters, his baby brother. Paetram would be nine now,
no doubt objecting more strenuously than ever to being called the
baby, Deselle a plump twelve, and Adora sixteen, probably ready to
braid her hair. Uncle Eward, his da&rsquo;s brother, and Aunt Magde,
stout and looking nearly alike, and their children. Aunt Neain, who
visited Uncle Carlin&rsquo;s grave every morning, and their children, and
Great Aunt Ealsin, who had never married, with her sharp nose and
sharper eye for discovering what everyone for miles around was up
to. Once apprenticed to Master Luhhan, he had seen them only on
feastdays; the distance was too great for casual travel, and there
had always been work to do. If the Whitecloaks hunted for Aybaras,
they were easy to find. They were his responsibility, not this
Slayer. He could only do so much. Protect his family, and Faile.
That was first. Then came the village, and the wolves, and this
Slayer last. One man could not manage everything.</p>

<p>The Westwood grew on stony soil broken by bramble
covered outcrops, a hard, thickly treed land with few farms or
paths. He had wandered these heavy woods as a boy, alone or with
Rand and Mat, hunting with bow or sling, setting snares for rabbits
or simply roaming for the sake of roaming. Bushy-tailed squirrels
chittering in the trees, speckled thrushes warbling on branches
imitated by black-winged mockers, bluebacked quail bursting up out
of the brush in front of the travelers&mdash;all spoke to him of home.
The very smell of the dirt the horses&rsquo; hooves turned was a
recognition.</p>

<p>He could have headed straight for Emond&rsquo;s Field, but
instead he angled more northward through the forest, finally
crossing the wide, rough track called the Quarry Road as the sun
slanted down toward the treetops. Why &ldquo;quarry&rdquo; no one in the Two
Rivers knew, and it scarcely looked a road at all, only a weedy
stretch that you did not even notice was bare of trees until you
saw the overgrown ruts from generations of wagons and carts.
Sometimes shards of old pavement worked their way to the surface.
Perhaps it had led to a quarry for Manetheren.</p>

<p>The farm Perrin sought lay not far from the road,
beyond rows of apple and pear trees where fruit was setting. He
smelled the farm before he saw it. The smell of char; not new, yet
a full year would not soften that smell.</p>

<p>He reined in at the edge of the trees and sat staring
before he made himself ride into what had been the al&rsquo;Thor farm,
the packhorse trailing behind his dun. Only the stone walled sheep
pen still stood, railed gate open and hanging by one hinge. The
soot-blackened chimney cast a slanting shadow across the tumbled
burned beams of the farmhouse. The barn and the tabac-curing shed
were only ashes. Weeds choked the tabac field and the vegetable
garden, and the garden had a trampled look; most of what was not
sawleaf or feathertop lay broken and brown.</p>

<p>He did not even think of nocking an arrow. The fire
was weeks old, the burned wood slicked and dulled by past rains.
Chokevine needed nearly a month to grow that tall. It had even
enveloped the plow and harrow lying beside the field; rust showed
under the pale, narrow leaves.</p>

<p>The Aiel searched carefully, though, spears ready and
eyes wary, quartering the ground and poking through the ashes. When
Bain clambered out of the ruins of the house, she looked at Perrin
and shook her head. At least Tam al&rsquo;Thor had not died in there.</p>

<p><em>They know. They know, Rand. You should have
come</em>. It was very nearly more than he could do to stop from
putting Stepper to a gallop, keeping him there all the way to his
family&rsquo;s farm. Trying to, at least; even Stepper would fall dead
before he ran that far. Maybe this was Trolloc work. If it was
Trollocs, maybe his family was still working their farm, still
safe. He drew a deep breath, but the char obliterated any other
smell.</p>

<p>Gaul stopped beside him. &ldquo;Whoever did this is long
gone. They killed some of the sheep and scattered the rest. Someone
came later to gather the flock and drive it off north. Two men, I
think, but the tracks are too old to be sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there any clue to who did it?&rdquo; Gaul shook his
head. It could have been Trollocs. Strange, to wish for a thing
like that. And foolish. The Whitecloaks knew his name, and they
knew Rand&rsquo;s as well, it seemed. <em>They know my name</em>. He
looked at the ashes of the al&rsquo;Thor farmhouse, and Stepper moved as
the reins trembled in his hands.</p>

<p>Loial had dismounted at the edge of the fruit trees,
but his head was still in the branches. Faile rode toward Perrin,
studying his face, her mare stepping delicately. &ldquo;Is this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?
Do you know the people who lived here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand and his father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh. I thought it might be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; The relief and
sympathy in her voice were enough to finish the sentence. &ldquo;Does
your family live near?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said curtly, and she recoiled as if slapped.
But she still watched him, waiting. What did he have to do to drive
her away? More than he could bring himself to, if he had not
managed it already.</p>

<p>The shadows were growing longer, the sun sitting on
the treetops. He reined Stepper around, rudely turning his back on
her. &ldquo;Gaul, we will have to camp close by tonight. I want to start
early in the morning.&rdquo; He sneaked a glance over his shoulder; Faile
was riding back to Loial, sitting stiff in her saddle. &ldquo;In Emond&rsquo;s
Field, they will know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Where the Whitecloaks were, so he
could turn himself in before they hurt his family. If his family
was all right. If the farm where he had been born was not already
like this. No. He had to be in time to stop that. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll know how
things are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Early, then.&rdquo; Gaul hesitated. &ldquo;You will not drive
her off. That one is almost <em>Far Dareis Mai</em>, and if a
Maiden loves you, you cannot escape her however hard you run.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You let me worry about Faile.&rdquo; He softened his
voice; it was not Gaul he wanted to be rid of. &ldquo;Very early. While
Faile is still asleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both camps, beneath the apple trees, were quiet that
night. Several times one or the other of the Aiel women stood,
staring toward the small fire where he and Gaul sat, but an owl
hooting and the horses stamping were the only sounds. Perrin could
not sleep, and it was still an hour short of first light, with the
full moon setting, when he and Gaul slipped away, the Aiel silent
in his soft boots and the horses&rsquo; hooves making little more noise.
Bain, or maybe Chiad, watched them go. He could not tell which, but
she did not wake Faile, and he was grateful.</p>

<p>The sun had climbed well up by the time they came out
of the Westwood a little below the village, amid cart tracks and
paths, most bordered by hedges or low rough stone walls. Smoke made
feathery gray plumes above farmhouse chimneys, goodwives doing the
morning&rsquo;s baking, by the smell. Men dotted the fields of tabac or
barley, and boys watched flocks of black-faced sheep in the
pastures. Some people took note of their passing, but Perrin kept
Stepper at a fast walk and hoped none were close enough to
recognize him or wonder at the strangeness of Gaul&rsquo;s clothes, or
his spears.</p>

<p>People would be out and about in Emond&rsquo;s Field, too,
so he circled around to the east, wide of the village, wide of the
hard packed dirt streets and thatched roofs clustered around the
Green, where the Winespring itself gushed from a stone outcrop with
enough force to knock a man down and gave birth to the Winespring
Water. The damage he remembered from Winternight a year gone, the
burned houses and charred roofs, were all rebuilt and repaired. The
Trollocs might as well never have come back then. He prayed no one
would have to live through that again. The Winespring Inn stood
practically at the eastern end of Emond&rsquo;s Field, between the stout
wooden Wagon Bridge across the rushing Winespring Water and a huge
old stone foundation with a great oak growing up through the middle
of it. Tables beneath the thick branches were where folk sat of a
fine afternoon and watched the play at bowls. At this hour of the
morning, the tables were empty, of course. There were only a few
houses farther east. The inn itself was river rock on the first
floor, with a whitewashed second story jutting out all the way
around and a dozen chimneys rising above a glittering red tile
roof, the only tile roof for miles.</p>

<p>Tying Stepper and the packhorse to a hitchpost near
the kitchen door, Perrin glanced at the thatch roofed stable. He
could hear men working in there, probably Hu and Tad, mucking out
the stalls where Master al&rsquo;Vere kept the big Dhurran team he rented
out for heavy hauling. There were sounds from the other side of the
inn, too, the murmur of voices on the Green, geese honking, the
rumble of a wagon. What was on the horses, he left; this would be a
short stop. He motioned for Gaul to follow and hurried inside,
carrying his bow, before either stableman could come out.</p>

<p>The kitchen was empty, both iron stoves and all but
one fireplace cold, though the smell of baking still hung in the
air. Bread and honeycakes. The inn seldom had guests except when
merchants came down from Baerlon to buy wool or tabac, or a monthly
peddler when snow had not made the road impassable, and the village
folk who might come for a drink or a meal later in the day would
all be hard at work at their own homes now. Someone might be there,
though, so Perrin tiptoed along the short hallway leading from the
kitchen to the common room and cracked the door to peek inside.</p>

<p>He had seen that square room a thousand times, with
its fireplace of river stones stretching half the room&rsquo;s length,
the lintel as high as a man&rsquo;s shoulder, Master al&rsquo;Vere&rsquo;s polished
tabac canister and prized clock sitting on the mantel. It all seemed
smaller than it had, somehow. The tall-backed chairs in front of
the fireplace were where the Village Council met. Brandelwyn
al&rsquo;Vere&rsquo;s books sat on a shelf opposite the fireplace&mdash;once, Perrin
had been unable to imagine more books in one place than those few
dozen mostly worn volumes&mdash;and casks of ale and wine lined another
wall. Scratch, the inn&rsquo;s yellow cat, sprawled asleep as usual atop
one.</p>

<p>Except for Bran al&rsquo;Vere himself and his wife, Marin,
in long white aprons, polishing the inn&rsquo;s silver and pewter at one
of the tables, the common room stood empty. Master al&rsquo;Vere was a
wide, round man, with a sparse fringe of gray hair; Mistress
al&rsquo;Vere was slender and motherly, her thick, graying braid pulled
over one shoulder. She smelled of baking, and under that of roses.
Perrin remembered them as smiling people, but both looked intent
now, and the Mayor wore a frown that surely had nothing to do with
the silver cup in his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master al&rsquo;Vere?&rdquo; He pushed open the door and went
in. &ldquo;Mistress al&rsquo;Vere. It&rsquo;s Perrin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They sprang to their feet, knocking their chairs over
and making Scratch jump. Mistress al&rsquo;Vere clapped her hands to her
mouth; she and her husband gaped as much at him as they did at
Gaul. It was enough to make Perrin shift his bow awkwardly from
hand to hand. Especially when Bran hurried to one of the front
windows&mdash;he moved with surprising lightness for a man of his bulk&mdash;and twitched the summer curtains aside to peer out, as though for
more Aiel outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perrin?&rdquo; Mistress al&rsquo;Vere murmured disbelievingly.
&ldquo;It <em>is</em> you. I almost didn&rsquo;t know you, with that beard, and&mdash;Your cheek. Were you&mdash;? Is Egwene with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin touched the half-healed slash across his cheek
self-consciously, wishing he had cleaned up, or at least left the
bow and axe in the kitchen. He had not considered how his
appearance might frighten them. &ldquo;No. This has nothing to do with
her. She is safe.&rdquo; Safer on her way back to Tar Valon, perhaps,
than if still in Tear with Rand, but safe in either case. He
supposed he had to give Egwene&rsquo;s mother something more than that
bald statement. &ldquo;Mistress al&rsquo;Vere, Egwene is studying to be Aes
Sedai. Nynaeve, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said quietly, touching the pocket on
her apron. &ldquo;I have three letters from her in Tar Valon. From what
she writes she sent more, and Nynaeve at least one, but only three
of Egwene&rsquo;s have reached us. She tells something of her training,
which I must say sounds very hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is what she wants.&rdquo; Three letters? Guilt made him
shrug uncomfortably. He had not written a letter to anyone, not
since the notes he had left for his family and Master Luhhan the
night Moiraine took him away from Emond&rsquo;s Field. Not one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it seems, though not what I had envisioned for
her. It isn&rsquo;t something I can tell many people about, now is it?
She says she&rsquo;s made friends, anyway, nice girls by the sound of
them. Elayne, and Min. Do you know them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have met. I think you could call them nice
girls.&rdquo; How much had Egwene told in those letters? Not much,
evidently. Let Mistress al&rsquo;Vere think what she would; he had no
intention of worrying her over things she could do nothing about.
What was past, was past. Egwene was safe enough now.</p>

<p>Abruptly realizing that Gaul was just standing there,
he made hasty introductions. Bran blinked when Gaul was named Aiel,
and frowned at his spears and the black veil hanging down his chest
from his <em>shoufa</em>, but his wife merely said, &ldquo;Be welcome to
Emond&rsquo;s Field, Master Gaul, and to the Winespring Inn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May you always have water and shade, roofmistress,&rdquo;
Gaul said formally, bowing to her. &ldquo;I ask leave to defend your roof
and hold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She barely hesitated before replying as if that were
exactly what she was used to hearing. &ldquo;A gracious offer. But you
must allow me to decide when it is needed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you say, roofmistress. Your honor is mine.&rdquo; From
under his coat, Gaul produced a gold saltcellar, a small bowl
balanced on the back of a cunningly made lion, and extended it to
her. &ldquo;I offer this small guest gift to your roof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marin al&rsquo;Vere made over it as she would have any
gift, hardly showing her shock. Perrin doubted there was a piece to
equal it in the whole Two Rivers, certainly not in gold. There was
little enough gold coin in the Two Rivers, much less gold
ornaments. He hoped she never found out it had been looted from the
Stone of Tear; at least he would have wagered that it had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; Bran said, &ldquo;perhaps I should be saying
&lsquo;welcome home,&rsquo; but why did you return?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard about the Whitecloaks, sir,&rdquo; Perrin replied
simply.</p>

<p>The Mayor and his wife shared somber looks, and Bran
said, &ldquo;Again, why did you return? You cannot stop anything, my boy,
or change anything. Best that you go. If you don&rsquo;t have a horse, I
will give you one. If you do, climb back in your saddle and ride
north. I thought the Whitecloaks were guarding Taren Ferry&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Did they give you that decoration on your face?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. It&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it doesn&rsquo;t matter. If you got past them coming
in, you can get past to leave. Their main camp is up at Watch Hill,
but their patrols can be anywhere. Do it, my boy. &rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wait, Perrin,&rdquo; Mistress al&rsquo;Vere added quietly
but firmly, in that voice that usually ended with people doing as
she said. &ldquo;Not even an hour. I&rsquo;ll make you a bundle to take with
you. Some fresh bread and cheese, some ham and roast beef, pickles.
You must go, Perrin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot. You know they are after me, or you&rsquo;d not
want me to go.&rdquo; And they had not commented on his eyes, even to ask
if he was ill. Mistress al&rsquo;Vere had barely been surprised. They
knew. &ldquo;If I give myself up, I can stop some of it. I can keep my
family&mdash;&rdquo; He jumped as the hall door banged open to admit
Faile, followed by Bain and Chiad.</p>

<p>Master al&rsquo;Vere ran a hand over his bald head; even
taking in the Aiel women&rsquo;s garb and obviously identifying them with
Gaul, he only seemed a little bemused that they were women. Mainly
he looked irritated at the intrusion. Scratch sat up to stare
suspiciously at all these strangers. Perrin wondered whether the
cat considered him one, as well. He wondered how they had found
him, too, and where Loial was. Anything to avoid wondering how he
was going to manage Faile now.</p>

<p>She gave him little time to ponder, planting herself
in front of him with fists on hips. Somehow she managed that trick
women had, making herself seem taller through pure quivering
outrage. &ldquo;Give yourself up? Give yourself up! Have you been
planning this from the start? You have, haven&rsquo;t you? You utter
idiot! Your brain has frozen solid, Perrin Aybara. It was nothing
but muscle and hair to begin, but now it isn&rsquo;t even that. If
Whitecloaks are hunting you, they will hang you if you surrender to
them. Why should they want you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I killed Whitecloaks.&rdquo; Looking down at her,
he ignored Mistress al&rsquo;Vere&rsquo;s gasp. &ldquo;Those the night I met you, and
two before that. They know about those two, Faile, and they think
I&rsquo;m a Darkfriend.&rdquo; She would learn that much soon enough. Brought
to the point of it, he might have told her why, had they been
alone. At least two Whitecloaks, Geofram Bornhald and Jaret Byar,
suspected something of his connection with wolves. Not nearly all,
but for them the little was enough. A man who ran with wolves had
to be a Darkfriend. Maybe one or both was with the Whitecloaks
here. &ldquo;They believe it for true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are no more a Darkfriend than I,&rdquo; she whispered
harshly. &ldquo;The sun could be a Darkfriend first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It makes no difference, Faile. I have to do what I
have to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You addle-brained lummox! You don&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to
do any such crackpate thing! You goose-brain! If you try it, I&rsquo;ll
hang you myself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perrin,&rdquo; Mistress al&rsquo;Vere said quietly, &ldquo;would you
introduce me to this young woman who thinks so highly of you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faile&rsquo;s face went bright red when she realized she
had been ignoring Master and Mistress al&rsquo;Vere, and she began making
elaborate curtsies and offered flowery apologies. Bain and Chiad
did as Gaul had, asking leave to defend Mistress al&rsquo;Vere&rsquo;s roof and
giving her a small golden bowl worked in leaves and an ornate
silver pepper mill bigger than Perrin&rsquo;s two fists, topped by some
fanciful creature half horse, half fish.</p>

<p>Bran al&rsquo;Vere stared and frowned, rubbed his head and
muttered to himself. Perrin caught the word &ldquo;Aiel&rdquo; more than once
in an incredulous tone. The Mayor kept glancing at the windows,
too. Not wondering about more Aiel; he had been surprised to learn
Gaul was Aiel. Maybe he was worried about Whitecloaks.</p>

<p>Marin al&rsquo;Vere, on the other hand, took it all in
stride, treating Faile and Bain and Chiad the same as any other
young women travelers who came to the inn, commiserating with them
over how tiring travel was, complimenting Faile on her riding dress&mdash;dark blue silk, today&mdash;and telling the Aiel women how
she admired the color and sheen of their hair. Perrin suspected
that Bain and Chiad, at least, did not know quite what to make of
her, but in short order, with a sort of calm motherly firmness, she
had all three women settled at a table with damp towels to wipe
journey dust from hands and faces, sipping tea she poured from a
large red-striped pot he remembered well.</p>

<p>It might have been amusing seeing those fierce women&mdash;he certainly included Faile&mdash;suddenly eager to assure
Mistress al&rsquo;Vere that they were more than comfortable, was there
nothing they could do to help, she was doing too much, all of them
wide eyed as children, with a child&rsquo;s chance of resisting her. It
would have been amusing if she had not included himself and Gaul,
sweeping them just as firmly to the table, insisting on clean hands
and clean faces before they got a cup of tea. Gaul wore a small
grin the whole time; Aiel had a strange sense of humor.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, she never glanced at his bow or axe, or
the Aiel&rsquo;s weapons. People seldom carried even a bow in the Two
Rivers, and she always insisted such be set aside before anyone
took a place at one of her tables. Always. But she just ignored
them now.</p>

<p>Another surprise came when Bran placed a silver cup
of apple brandy at Perrin&rsquo;s elbow, not the small tot that men
usually drank at the inn, barely enough to cover the last joint of
the thumb, but half-full. When he had left he would have been
offered cider if not milk, or perhaps well-watered wine, a half-cup
with a meal or a full one on a feastday. It was gratifying to be
recognized as a grown man, but he only held it. He was used to wine
now, but he seldom drank anything stronger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perrin,&rdquo; the Mayor said as he took a chair beside
his wife, &ldquo;no one believes you a Darkfriend. No one with any sense.
There is no reason for you to let yourself be hanged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faile nodded in fierce agreement, but Perrin ignored
her. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be turned aside, Master al&rsquo;Vere. The Whitecloaks want
me, and if they do not get me, they might turn to the next Aybara
they can find. Whitecloaks don&rsquo;t need much to decide somebody is
guilty. They are not pleasant people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know,&rdquo; Mistress al&rsquo;Vere said softly.</p>

<p>Her husband stared at his hands on the table.
&ldquo;Perrin, your family is gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone? You mean the farm is burned already?&rdquo; Perrin&rsquo;s
fist tightened around the silver cup. &ldquo;I hoped I was in time. I
should have known better, I suppose. Too long before I heard. Maybe
I can help my da and Uncle Eward rebuild. Who are they staying
with? I want to see them first, at least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bran grimaced, and his wife stroked his shoulder
comfortingly. But strangely her eyes stayed on Perrin, all sadness
and comfort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are dead, my boy,&rdquo; Bran said in a rush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dead? No. They can&rsquo;t be&mdash;&rdquo; Perrin frowned as
wetness suddenly slopped over his hand, stared at the crumpled cup
as though wondering where it had come from. &ldquo;I am sorry. I didn&rsquo;t
mean to&mdash;&rdquo; He pulled at the flattened silver, trying to force
it back out with his fingers. That would not work. Of course not.
Very carefully, he put the ruined cup in the middle of the table.
&ldquo;I will replace it. I can&mdash;&rdquo; He wiped his hand on his coat,
and suddenly found he was caressing the axe hanging at his belt.
Why was everyone looking at him so oddly? &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; His voice
sounded far away. &ldquo;Adora and Deselle? Paet? My mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All of them,&rdquo; Bran told him. &ldquo;Your aunts and uncles,
too, and your cousins. Everybody on the farm. I helped bury them,
my boy. On that low hill, the one with the apple trees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin stuck his thumb in his mouth. Fool thing to
do, cutting himself on his own axe. &ldquo;My mother likes apple
blossoms. The Whitecloaks. Why would they&mdash;? Burn me, Paet was
only nine. The girls&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; His voice was very flat. He thought he
should have had some emotion in those words. Some emotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Trollocs,&rdquo; Mistress al&rsquo;Vere said quickly.
&ldquo;They have come back, Perrin. Not the way they did when you went
away, not attacking the village, but out in the countryside. Most
farms without close neighbors have been abandoned. No one goes
outside at night, even near to the village. It is the same down to
Deven Ride and up to Watch Hill, maybe to Taren Ferry. The
Whitecloaks, bad as they are, are our only real protection. They&rsquo;ve
saved two families that I know, when Trollocs attacked their farms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wished&mdash;I hoped&mdash;&rdquo; He could not quite
remember what it was he had wished. Something about Trollocs. He
did not want to remember. The Whitecloaks protecting the Two
Rivers? It was almost enough to make him laugh. &ldquo;Rand&rsquo;s father.
Tam&rsquo;s farm. Was that Trollocs, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mistress al&rsquo;Vere opened her mouth, but Bran cut her
off. &ldquo;He deserves the truth, Marin. That was Whitecloaks, Perrin.
That, and the Cauthon place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat&rsquo;s people too. Rand&rsquo;s, and Mat&rsquo;s, and mine.&rdquo;
Strange. He sounded as if he were talking about whether it might
rain. &ldquo;Are they dead, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my boy. No, Abell and Tam are hiding in the
Westwood somewhere. And Mat&rsquo;s mother and sisters&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;They&rsquo;re
alive, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hiding?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no need to go into that,&rdquo; Mistress al&rsquo;Vere
said briskly. &ldquo;Bran, bring him another cup of brandy. And you drink
this one, Perrin.&rdquo; Her husband sat where he was, but she only
frowned at him and went on. &ldquo;I would offer you a bed, but it isn&rsquo;t
safe. Some people are like as not to run off hunting for Lord
Bornhald if they find out you are here. Eward Congar and Hari
Coplin fawn after the Whitecloaks like heel-hounds, eager to please
and name names, and Cenn Buie isn&rsquo;t much better. And Wit Congar
will carry tales, too, if Daise doesn&rsquo;t stop him. She is the
Wisdom, now. Perrin, it is best for to go. Believe me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin shook his head slowly; it was too much to take
in. Daise Congar the Wisdom? The woman was like a bull. Whitecloaks
protecting Emond&rsquo;s Field. Hari and Eward and Wit cooperating. Not
much more could be expected from Congars or Coplins, but Cenn Buie
was on the Village Council. Lord Bornhald. So Geofram Bornhald was
there. Faile was watching him, her eyes large and moist. Why should
she be on the edge of tears?</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is more, Brandelwyn al&rsquo;Vere,&rdquo; Gaul said. &ldquo;Your
face says so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is,&rdquo; Bran agreed. &ldquo;No, Marin,&rdquo; he added firmly
when she gave a small shake of her head. &ldquo;He deserves the truth.
The whole truth.&rdquo; She folded her hands with a sigh; Marin al&rsquo;Vere
very nearly always got her way&mdash;except when Bran&rsquo;s face was set, as
now, with his eyebrows drawn down hard as a plow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What truth?&rdquo; Perrin asked. His mother liked apple
blossoms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First off, Padan Fain is with the Whitecloaks,&rdquo; Bran
said. &ldquo;He calls himself Ordeith now, and he won&rsquo;t answer to his own
name at all, but it&rsquo;s him, stare down his nose as he will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a Darkfriend,&rdquo; Perrin said absently. Adora and
Deselle always put apple blossoms in their hair in the spring.
&ldquo;Admitted from his own mouth. He brought the Trollocs, on
Winternight.&rdquo; Paet liked to climb in the apple trees; he would
throw apples at you from the branches if you did not watch him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he, now,&rdquo; the Mayor said grimly. &ldquo;Now, that is
interesting. He has some authority with the Whitecloaks. The first
we heard they were here was after they burned Tam&rsquo;s farm. That was
Fain&rsquo;s work; he led the Whitecloaks that did it. Tam feathered four
or five of them with arrows before he made it to the woods, and he
reached the Cauthon farm in the nick to stop them taking Abell. But
they arrested Natti and the girls. And Haral Luhhan, and Alsbet,
too. I think Fain might have hung them, except Lord Bornhald
wouldn&rsquo;t allow it. Not that he let them go, either. They haven&rsquo;t
been harmed, as far as I can discover, but they&rsquo;re being held in
the Whitecloak camp up at Watch Hill. For some reason, Fain has a
hate for you, and Rand, and Mat. He&rsquo;s offered a hundred pieces of
gold for anyone related to the three of you; two hundred for Tam or
Abell. And Lord Bornhald seems to have some interest in you,
especially. When a Whitecloak patrol comes here, he usually comes,
too, and asks questions about you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Perrin said. &ldquo;Of course. He would.&rdquo; Perrin of
the Two Rivers, who ran with wolves. Darkfriend. Fain could have
told them the rest. <em>Fain, with the Children of the Light?</em>
It was a distant thought. Better than thinking about Trollocs,
though. He grimaced at his hands, made them be still on the table.
&ldquo;They protect you from the Trollocs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marin al&rsquo;Vere leaned toward him, frowning. &ldquo;Perrin,
we need the Whitecloaks. Yes, they burned Tam&rsquo;s farm, and Abell&rsquo;s,
they&rsquo;ve arrested people, and they stamp around as if they own
everything they see, but Alsbet and Natti and the rest are
unharmed, only held, and that can be straightened out somehow. The
Dragon&rsquo;s Fang has been scrawled on a few doors, but nobody except
the Congars and Coplins pay any mind, and they&rsquo;re likely the ones
who did the scrawling. Tam and Abell can stay in hiding until the
Whitecloaks go. They have to go sooner or later. But as long as
there are Trollocs here, we do need them. Please understand. It
isn&rsquo;t that we would not rather have you than them, but we need them
and we don&rsquo;t want them to hang you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You call this being protected, roofmistress?&rdquo; Bain
said. &ldquo;If you ask the lion to protect you from wolves, you have
only chosen to end in one belly instead of another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you not protect yourselves?&rdquo; Chiad added. &ldquo;I
have seen Perrin fight, and Mat Cauthon, and Rand al&rsquo;Thor. They are
the same blood as you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bran sighed heavily. &ldquo;We are farmers, simple people.
Lord Luc talks of organizing men to fight the Trollocs, but that
means leaving your family unprotected while you go off with him,
and no one much likes that idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin was confused. Who was Lord Luc? He asked as
much, and Mistress al&rsquo;Vere answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He came about the time the Whitecloaks did. He&rsquo;s a
Hunter of the Horn. You know the story, <em>The Great Hunt of the
Horn</em>? Lord Luc thinks the Horn of Valere is somewhere in the
Mountains of Mist above the Two Rivers. But he gave over his hunt
because of our problems. Lord Luc is a great gentleman, with the
finest manners.&rdquo; Smoothing her hair, she gave an approving smile;
Bran looked at her sideways and grunted sourly.</p>

<p>Hunters of the Horn. Trollocs. Whitecloaks. The Two
Rivers hardly seemed the same place he had left. &ldquo;Faile is a Hunter
of the Horn, too. Do you know this Lord Luc, Faile?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have had enough,&rdquo; she announced. Perrin frowned as
she stood and came around the table to him. Seizing his head, she
pulled his face into her midriff. &ldquo;Your mother is dead,&rdquo; she said
quietly. &ldquo;Your father is dead. Your sisters are dead, and your
brother. Your family is dead, and you cannot change it. Certainly
not by dying yourself. Let yourself grieve. Don&rsquo;t hold it inside
where it can fester.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took her by the arms, meaning to move her, but for
some reason his hands tightened till that grip was the only thing
holding him up. It was only then that he realized he was crying,
sobbing into her dress like a baby. What must she think of him? He
opened his mouth to tell her he was all right, to apologize for
breaking down, but what came out was, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t get here any
faster. I couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; He gritted his teeth to shut
himself off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she murmured, stroking his hair for all the
world as if he were a child. &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He wanted to stop, but the more she whispered
understanding, the more he wept, as though her hands soft on his
head were smoothing the tears out of him.</p>
