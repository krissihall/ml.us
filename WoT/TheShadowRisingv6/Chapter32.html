should leave for Watch Hill soon,&rdquo; Verin
announced the next morning, with sunrise just pearling the sky
outside, &ldquo;so don&rsquo;t dawdle.&rdquo; Perrin looked up from his cold porridge
to meet a steady gaze; the Aes Sedai expected no arguments. After a
moment, she added thoughtfully, &ldquo;Do not think this means I will aid
you in any foolishness. You are a tricksome young man. Try none of
it with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tam and Abell paused with spoons halfway to their
mouths, exchanging surprised looks; clearly they had gone their own
way and the Aes Sedai theirs before this. After a moment they
resumed eating, although with pensive frowns. They left any
objections unvoiced. Tomas, his Warder&rsquo;s cloak already packed away
in his saddlebags, gave them&mdash;and Perrin&mdash;a hard-faced
stare anyway, as if he anticipated arguments and meant to stamp
them out. Warders did whatever was necessary for an Aes Sedai to do
what she wanted.</p>

<p>She intended to meddle, of course&mdash;Aes Sedai
always did&mdash;but having her where he could see her was surely
better than leaving her behind his back. Avoiding Aes Sedai
entanglements completely was all but impossible when they meant to
dabble their fingers in; the only course was to try to use them
while they used you, to watch and hope you could jump clear if they
decided to stuff you headfirst, like a ferret, down a rabbithole.
Sometimes the rabbithole turned out to be a badger&rsquo;s sett, which
was hard on the ferret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would be welcome, too,&rdquo; he told Alanna, but she
gave him a frosty stare that stopped him in his tracks. She had
disdained the porridge, and stood at one of the vine-shrouded
windows, peering through the leafy screen.</p>

<p>He could not say whether she was pleased with his
plans for a scout. Reading her seemed near to impossible. Aes Sedai
were supposed to be cool serenity itself, and she was that, but
Alanna tossed off flashes of fiery temper or unpredictable humor
when least expected, like heat lightning, crackling then gone.
Sometimes she looked at him so that if she had not been Aes Sedai
he would have thought she was admiring him. Other times he might as
well have been some complicated mechanism she meant to disassemble
in order to puzzle out how it worked. Even Verin had the better of
that; most of the time she was just plain unreadable. Unnerving, on
occasion, but at least he did not have to wonder if she was going
to know how to fit his pieces back together.</p>

<p>He wished he could make Faile stay there&mdash;that
was not the same as leaving her behind, just keeping her safe from
Whitecloaks&mdash;but she had that stubborn set to her jaw and a
dangerous light in her tilted eyes. &ldquo;I look forward to seeing some
of your country. My father raises sheep.&rdquo; Her tone was definite;
she was not going to stay unless he tied her up.</p>

<p>For a moment he came close to considering it. But the
danger from Whitecloaks should not be that great; he only intended
to look, today. &ldquo;I thought he was a merchant,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He raises sheep, too.&rdquo; Spots of crimson bloomed in
her cheeks: maybe her father was a poor man and not a merchant at
all. He did not know why she would pretend, but if that was what
she wanted, he would not try to stop her. Embarrassed or not,
however, she looked no less stubborn.</p>

<p>He remembered Master Cauthon&rsquo;s method. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
how much you&rsquo;ll see. Some farms may be shearing, I suppose.
Probably no different from what your father does. I&rsquo;ll be glad of
your company in any case.&rdquo; The startlement on her face when she
realized he was not going to argue was almost worth the worry of
her coming along. Maybe Abell had something.</p>

<p>Loial was another matter altogether.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I want to go,&rdquo; the Ogier protested when told he
could not. &ldquo;I want to help, Perrin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will stand out, Master Loial,&rdquo; Abell said, and
Tam added, &ldquo;We need to avoid attracting any more attention than we
must.&rdquo; Loial&rsquo;s ears drooped dejectedly.</p>

<p>Perrin drew him aside, as far from the others as the
room would allow. Loial&rsquo;s shaggy hair brushed the roof beams until
Perrin motioned him to lean down. Perrin smiled, just jollying him
along. He hoped everyone else believed that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you to keep an eye on Alanna,&rdquo; he said in a
near whisper. Loial gave a start, and he caught the Ogier&rsquo;s sleeve,
still smiling like a fool. &ldquo;Grin, Loial. We are not talking about
anything important, right?&rdquo; The Ogier managed an uncertain smile.
It would have to do. &ldquo;Aes Sedai do what they do for their own
reasons, Loial.&rdquo; And that might be what you least expected, or not
at all what you believed it was. &ldquo;Who knows what she might take
into her head? I&rsquo;ve had surprises enough since coming home, and I
don&rsquo;t want one of hers added to it. I don&rsquo;t expect you to stop her,
only notice anything out of the ordinary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you for that,&rdquo; Loial muttered wryly, ears
jerking. &ldquo;Do you not think it best to just let Aes Sedai do what
they want?&rdquo; That was easy for him to say; Aes Sedai could not
channel inside an Ogier <em>stedding</em>. Perrin just looked at
him, and after a moment, the Ogier sighed. &ldquo;I suppose not. Oh, very
well. I can never say being around you is not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;interesting.&rdquo;
Straightening, he rubbed a thick finger under his nose and told the
others, &ldquo;I suppose I would draw eyes at that. Well, it will give me
a chance to work on my notes. I have done nothing on my book in
days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verin and Alanna shared an unreadable look, then
turned twin unblinking gazes on Perrin. There was simply no telling
what either thought.</p>

<p>The pack animals had to be left behind, of course.
Packhorses would surely occasion comment, speaking of long travel;
no one in the Two Rivers traveled very far from home in the best of
times. Alanna wore a slight, satisfied smile while watching them
saddle their mounts, no doubt believing the animals and wicker
hampers tied him to the old sickhouse, to her and Verin. She was in
for a surprise, if it came to that. He had lived out of a saddlebag
often enough since leaving home. For that matter, he had lived out
of his belt pouch and coat pockets.</p>

<p>He straightened from tightening Stepper&rsquo;s saddle
girth and gave a start. Verin was watching him with a knowing
expression, not vague at all, as if she knew what he was thinking
and was amused. It was bad enough when Faile did that sort of
thing; from an Aes Sedai, it was a hundred times worse. The hammer
lashed with his blanket roll and saddlebags seemed to puzzle her,
though. He was glad there was something she did not seem to
understand. On the other hand, he could have done without her being
so intrigued. What could be fascinating to an Aes Sedai about a
hammer?</p>

<p>With only the riding animals to prepare, it took no
time at all to be ready to go. Verin had a nondescript brown
gelding, as plain to the untrained eye as her garb, but its deep
chest and strong rump suggested as much endurance as her Warder&rsquo;s
ferocious-eyed gray, tall and sleek. Stepper snorted at the other
stallion until Perrin patted the dun&rsquo;s neck. The gray was more
disciplined&mdash;and just as ready to fight, if Tomas let it. The Warder
controlled his animal with his knees as much as his reins, the two
seeming almost one.</p>

<p>Master Cauthon watched Tomas&rsquo;s horse with interest&mdash;wartrained mounts were not much seen in these parts&mdash;but Verin&rsquo;s earned an approving nod at first glance. He was as good
a judge of horseflesh as there was in the Two Rivers. No doubt he
had chosen his and Master al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s rough-coated animals, not so
tall as the other horses, but sturdy, with gaits that spoke of good
speed and staying power.</p>

<p>The three Aiel glided ahead as the party started
north, with long strides that carried them out of sight quickly in
the woods, early-morning shadows sharp and long in the brightness
of sunrise. Now and then a flash of gray-and-brown was visible
through the trees, probably on purpose, to let the others know they
were there. Tam and Abell took the lead, bows across the tall
pommels of their saddles, with Perrin and Faile behind, and Verin
and Tomas bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>Perrin could have done without Verin&rsquo;s eyes on his
back. He could feel them between his shoulder blades. He wondered
if she knew about the wolves. Not a comfortable thought. Brown
sisters supposedly knew things the other Ajahs did not, obscure
things, old knowledge. Perhaps she knew how he could avoid losing
himself, what was human in him, to the wolves. Short of finding
Elyas Machera again, she might be his best chance. All he had to do
was trust her. Whatever she knew she would likely use, certainly to
help the White Tower, probably to help Rand. The only trouble was
that helping Rand might not bring what he wanted now. Everything
would have been so much simpler without any Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>Mostly they rode in silence except for the sounds of
the forest, squirrels and woodpeckers and occasional birdsong. At
one point Faile glanced back. &ldquo;She will not harm you,&rdquo; she said,
her soft tone clashing with the fierce light in her dark eyes.</p>

<p>Perrin blinked. She meant to protect him. Against Aes
Sedai. He was never going to understand her, or know what to expect
next. She was about as confusing as the Aes Sedai sometimes.</p>

<p>They broke out of the Westwood perhaps four or five
miles north of Emond&rsquo;s Field with the sun standing its own height
above the trees to the east. Scattered copses, mainly leatherleaf
and pine and oak, lay between them and the nearest hedged fields
of barley and oats, tabac and tall grass for hay. Strangely there
was no one in sight, no smoke rising from the farmhouse chimneys
beyond the fields. Perrin knew the people who lived there, the
al&rsquo;Loras in two of the big houses, the Barsteres in the others.
Hardworking folk. If there had been anyone in those houses, they
would have been at their labors long since. Gaul waved from the
edge of a thicket, then vanished into the trees.</p>

<p>Perrin heeled Stepper up beside Tam and Abell.
&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t we stay under cover as long as we can? Six people on
horses won&rsquo;t go unnoticed.&rdquo; They kept their mounts at a steady
walk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not many to notice us, lad,&rdquo; Master al&rsquo;Thor replied,
&ldquo;as long as we stay away from the North Road. Most farms have been
abandoned, close by to the woods. Anyway, nobody travels alone
these days, not far from their own doorstep. Ten people together
wouldn&rsquo;t be noticed twice nowadays, though mostly folk travel by
wagon, if at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll take us most of daylight to reach Watch Hill
as it is,&rdquo; Master Cauthon said, &ldquo;without trying to cover the
distance through the woods. Would be a little faster along the
road, but more chance of meeting Whitecloaks, too. More chance
somebody might turn us in for the rewards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tam nodded. &ldquo;But we have friends up this way, too. We
figure to stop at Jac al&rsquo;Seen&rsquo;s farm about midday to breathe the
horses and stretch our legs. We will make it to Watch Hill while
there&rsquo;s still light enough to see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There will be enough light,&rdquo; Perrin said absently;
there was always light enough for him. He twisted in his saddle to
peer back at the farmhouses. Abandoned, but not burned, not
ransacked that he could make out. Curtains hung at the windows
still. Unbroken windows. Trollocs liked smashing things, and empty
houses were an invitation. Weeds stood tall among the barley and
oats, but the fields had not been trampled. &ldquo;Have Trollocs attacked
Emond&rsquo;s Field itself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, they have not, &ldquo;Master Cauthon said in a
thankful tone. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d have no easy time if they did, mind. People
learned to keep a sharp eye out Winternight before last. There&rsquo;s a
bow beside every door, and spears and the like. Besides, the
Whitecloaks patrol down to Emond&rsquo;s Field every few days. Much as I
hate to admit it, they do keep the Trollocs back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin shook his head. &ldquo;Do you have any idea how many
Trollocs there are?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One&rsquo;s too many,&rdquo; Abell grunted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe two hundred,&rdquo; Tam said. &ldquo;Maybe more. Probably
more.&rdquo; Master Cauthon looked surprised. &ldquo;Think on it, Abell. I
don&rsquo;t know how many the Whitecloaks have killed, but the Warders
claim they and the Aes Sedai have finished off nearly fifty, and
two Fades. It hasn&rsquo;t lessened the number of burnings we hear about.
I think it has to be more, but you figure it out for yourself.&rdquo;
The other man nodded unhappily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why haven&rsquo;t they attacked Emond&rsquo;s Field?&rdquo;
Perrin asked. &ldquo;If two or three hundred came in the night, they
could likely burn the whole village and be gone before the
Whitecloaks up at Watch Hill even heard about it. Still easier for
them to hit Deven Ride. You said the Whitecloaks don&rsquo;t go down that
far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Luck,&rdquo; Abell muttered, but he sounded troubled.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it is. We&rsquo;ve been lucky. What else could it be? What
are you getting at, boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What he&rsquo;s getting at,&rdquo; Faile said, closing up beside
them, &ldquo;is that there must be a reason.&rdquo; Swallow was enough taller
than the Two Rivers horses to let her look Tam and Abell in the
eye, and she made it a firm look. &ldquo;I have seen the aftermath of
Trolloc raids in Saldaea. They despoil what they do not burn, kill
or carry off people and farm animals, whoever and whatever is not
protected. Entire villages have disappeared in bad years. They seek
wherever is weakest, wherever they can kill the most. My father&mdash;&rdquo; She bit it off, drew a deep breath, and went on. &ldquo;Perrin
has seen what you should have.&rdquo; She flashed him a proud smile. &ldquo;If
the Trollocs have not attacked your villages, they have a
reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have thought of that,&rdquo; Tam said quietly, &ldquo;but I
can&rsquo;t think why. Until we know, luck is as good an answer as
any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Verin said, joining them, &ldquo;it is a lure.&rdquo;
Tomas still hung back a little, dark eyes searching the country
they rode through as relentlessly as any Aiel&rsquo;s. The Warder was
watching the sky, too; there was always the chance of a raven.
Barely pausing, Verin&rsquo;s gaze brushed across Perrin to the two older
men. &ldquo;News of continued trouble, news of Trollocs, will draw eyes
to the Two Rivers. Andor will surely send soldiers, and perhaps
other lands as well, for Trollocs this far south. That is if the
Children are allowing any news out, of course. I surmise Queen
Morgase&rsquo;s Guards would be little happier to find so many
Whitecloaks than they would to find Trollocs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;War,&rdquo; Abell muttered. &ldquo;What we have is bad enough,
but you are talking war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might be so,&rdquo; Verin said complacently. &ldquo;It might
be.&rdquo; Frowning in a preoccupied manner, she dug a steel-nibbed pen
and a small cloth-bound book from her pouch, and opened a little
leather case at her belt that held an ink bottle and sandshaker.
Wiping the pen absentmindedly on her sleeve, she began jotting in
the book despite the awkwardness of writing while riding. She
seemed completely oblivious of any unease she might have caused.
Perhaps she really was.</p>

<p>Master Cauthon kept murmuring &ldquo;War,&rdquo; wonderingly,
under his breath, and Faile put a comforting hand on Perrin&rsquo;s arm,
her eyes sad.</p>

<p>Master al&rsquo;Thor only grunted; he had been in a war, so
Perrin had heard, though not where or how, exactly. Just somewhere
outside the Two Rivers, where he had gone as a young man, returning
years later with a wife and a child, Rand. Few Two Rivers folk ever
left. Perrin doubted if any of them really knew what a war was,
except by what they heard from peddlers, or merchants and their
guards and wagon drivers. He knew, though. He had seen war, on
Toman Head. Abell was right. What they had was bad enough, but it
did not come near war.</p>

<p>He held his peace. Maybe Verin was right. And maybe
she just wanted to stop them speculating. If Trollocs harrying the
Two Rivers were bait for a trap, it had to be a trap for Rand, and
the Aes Sedai had to know it. That was one of the problems with Aes
Sedai; they could hand you &ldquo;if&rdquo;s and &ldquo;might&rdquo;s until you were sure
they had told you flat out what they had only suggested. Well, if
the Trollocs&mdash;or whoever sent them, rather; one of the
Forsaken, maybe?&mdash;thought to trap, Rand, they would have to
settle for Perrin instead&mdash;a simple blacksmith instead of the
Dragon Reborn&mdash;and he did not mean to walk into any
traps.</p>

<p>They rode on silently through the morning. In this
region farms were scattered, with sometimes a mile or more between.
Every last one lay abandoned, fields choked with weeds, barn doors
swinging in any errant breeze. Only one had been burned, and of
that nothing stood except the chimneys, soot-black fingers rising
from ashes. The people who had died there&mdash;Ayellins, cousins
of those who lived in Emond&rsquo;s Field&mdash;had been buried near the
pear trees beyond the house. Those few who had been found. Abell
had to be pressed to talk about it, and Tam would not. They seemed
to think it would upset him. He knew what Trollocs ate. Anything
that was meat. He stroked his axe absently until Faile took his
hand. For some reason she was the one who seemed disturbed. He had
thought she knew more of Trollocs than that.</p>

<p>The Aiel managed to stay out of sight even between
copses, except when they wanted to be seen. When Tam began angling
eastward, Gaul and the two Maidens shifted with them.</p>

<p>As Master Cauthon had predicted, the al&rsquo;Seen farm
came in sight with the sun still shy of its full height. There was
not another farm in view, though a few widely separated gray plumes
of chimney smoke rose both north and east. Why were they hanging
on, isolated like this? If Trollocs came, their only hope was
Whitecloaks chancing to be near at the same time.</p>

<p>While the rambling farmhouse was still small in the
distance, Tam reined in and waved the Aiel to join them, suggesting
they find a place to wait until the rest of them left the farm.
&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t talk about Abell or me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but you three will
set tongues wagging with the best will in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was putting it mildly, with their odd clothes
and their spears, and two of them women. A rabbit apiece dangled
beside their quivers, though Perrin could not see how they had
found time to hunt while keeping ahead of the horses. They seemed
less tired than the horses, for that matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well enough,&rdquo; Gaul said. &ldquo;I will find a place to eat
my own meal, and watch for your going.&rdquo; He turned and loped away
immediately. Bain and Chiad exchanged glances. After a moment Chiad
shrugged, and they followed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they together?&rdquo; Mat&rsquo;s father asked,
scratching his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a long story,&rdquo; Perrin said. It was better than
telling him Chiad and Gaul might decide to kill each other over a
feud. He hoped the water oath held. He had to remember to ask Gaul
what a water oath was.</p>

<p>The al&rsquo;Seen farm was just about as big as farms went
in the Two Rivers, with three tall barns and five tabac curing
sheds. The stone-walled cote, full of black-faced sheep, spread as
wide as some pastures, and rail-fenced yards kept white-spotted
milk cows separate from black beef cattle. Pigs grunted contentedly
in their wallow, chickens wandered everywhere, and there were white
geese on a good-sized pond.</p>

<p>The first odd thing Perrin noticed was the boys on
the thatched roofs of the house and barns, eight or nine of them,
with bows and quivers. They shouted down as soon as they saw the
riders, and women hustled children inside before shading their eyes
to see who was coming. Men gathered in the farmyard, some with
bows, others with pitchforks and bushhooks held like weapons. Too
many people. Far too many, even for a farm as big as this. He
looked a question at Master al&rsquo;Thor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jac took in his cousin Wit&rsquo;s people,&rdquo; Tam explained,
&ldquo;because Wit&rsquo;s farm was too close to the Westwood. And Flann
Lewin&rsquo;s people after their farm was attacked. Whitecloaks drove the
Trollocs off before more than his barns were burned, but Flann
decided it was time to go. Jac is a good man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As they rode into the farmyard, and Tam and Abell
were recognized, men and women crowded around with smiles and a
babble of welcome while they dismounted. Seeing that, children
burst out of the house, followed by the women who had been minding
them and others, fresh from the kitchen, wiping hands on aprons.
Every generation was represented, from white-haired Astelle
al&rsquo;Seen, bent-backed but using her stick to thump people out of her
way more than to walk with, down to a swaddled infant in the arms
of a more than stout young woman with a bright smile.</p>

<p>Perrin looked past the stout, smiling woman; then his
head whipped back. When he had left the Two Rivers, Laila Dearn had
been a slim girl who could dance any three boys into the ground.
Only the smile and the eyes were the same. He shivered. There had
been a time when he had dreamed of marrying Laila, and she had
returned the feeling somewhat. The truth was, she had held on to it
longer than he had. Luckily, she was too entranced with her baby
and the even wider fellow by her side to pay much attention to him.
Perrin recognized the man with her, too. Natley Lewin. So Laila was
a Lewin now. Odd. Nat never could dance. Thanking the Light for his
escape, Perrin looked around for Faile.</p>

<p>He found her idly flipping Swallow&rsquo;s reins while the
mare nuzzled her shoulder. She was too busy smiling admiringly at
Wil al&rsquo;Seen, a cousin from Deven Ride way, to notice her horse,
though, and Wil was smiling back. A good-looking boy, Wil. Well, he
was a year older than Perrin, but too good-looking not to appear
boyish. When Wil came down to Emond&rsquo;s Field for dances, the girls
all used to stare at him and sigh. Just the way Faile was now.
True, she was not sighing, but her smile was decidedly
approving.</p>

<p>Perrin went over and put an arm around her, resting
his other hand on his axe. &ldquo;How are you, Wil?&rdquo; he asked, smiling
for all he was worth. No point in letting Faile think he was
jealous. Not that he was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine, Perrin.&rdquo; Wil&rsquo;s eyes slid away from his and
bounced off the axe, a sickly expression oozing over his face.
&ldquo;Just fine.&rdquo; Avoiding looking at Faile again, he hurried off to
join the crowd around Verin.</p>

<p>Faile looked up at Perrin, pursing her lips, then
took his beard with one hand and gently shook his head. &ldquo;Perrin,
Perrin, Perrin,&rdquo; she murmured softly.</p>

<p>He was not sure what she meant, but he thought it
wiser not to ask. She looked as if she did not know herself whether
she was angry or&mdash;could it possibly be amused? Best not to
make her decide.</p>

<p>Wil was not the only one to look askance at his eyes,
of course. It seemed that everyone, young or old, male or female,
gave a start the first time they met his gaze. Old Mistress al&rsquo;Seen
poked him with her stick, and her dark old eyes widened in surprise
when he grunted. Maybe she thought he was not real. Nobody said
anything, though.</p>

<p>Soon enough the horses had been led off to one of the
barns&mdash;Tomas took his gray himself; the animal did not appear
to want anyone else to touch the reins&mdash;and everybody except
the boys on the rooftops had crowded into the house, just about
filling it. Adults lined the front room two deep, Lewins and
al&rsquo;Seens interspersed in no particular order or rank, children in
their mothers&rsquo; arms or relegated to peering through the legs of
grown-ups packing the doorways to peer in.</p>

<p>Strong tea and high-backed, rush-bottomed chairs were
provided for the newcomers, though Verin and Faile got embroidered
cushions. There was considerable excitement over Verin, and Tomas,
and Faile. Murmurs filled the room like a gabble of geese, and
everyone stared at those three as though they wore crowns, or might
do tricks any moment. Strangers were always a curiosity in the Two
Rivers. Tomas&rsquo;s sword drew especial comment, in near whispers that
Perrin heard easily. Swords were not common here, or had not been
before the Whitecloaks came. Some thought Tomas was a Whitecloak,
others a lord. One boy little more than waist-high mentioned
Warders before his elders laughed him down.</p>

<p>As soon as the guests were settled, Jac al&rsquo;Seen
planted himself in front of the wide stone fireplace, a stocky,
square shouldered man with less hair than Master al&rsquo;Vere, and that
just as gray. A clock ticked on the mantel behind his head between
two large silver goblets, evidence of his success as a farmer. The
babble quieted when he raised a hand, though his cousin Wit, a near
twin except for no hair at all, and Flann Lewin, a gnarled,
gray-headed beanpole, both shushed their own folk anyway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mistress Mathwin, Lady Faile,&rdquo; Jac said, bowing
awkwardly to each, &ldquo;You are welcome here, for as long as you wish.
I have to caution you, though. You know the trouble we have in the
countryside. Best for you if you go straightway to Emond&rsquo;s Field,
or Watch Hill, and stay there. They are too big to be troubled. I
would advise you to leave the Two Rivers altogether, but I
understand the Children of the Light aren&rsquo;t letting anyone cross
the Taren. I don&rsquo;t know why, but there it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there are so many fine stories in the country,&rdquo;
Verin said, blinking mildly. &ldquo;I would miss them all if I remained
in a village.&rdquo; Without lying once, she managed to give the
impression that she had come to the Two Rivers in search of old
stories, the same as Moiraine had done, what seemed so long ago.
Her Great Serpent ring lay in her belt pouch, though Perrin doubted
that any of these people would know what it meant.</p>

<p>Elisa al&rsquo;Seen smoothed her white apron and smiled
gravely at Verin. Though her hair had less gray than her husband&rsquo;s,
she looked older than Verin, her lined face motherly. Very likely
she thought she was. &ldquo;It is an honor to have a real scholar under
our roof, yet Jac is right,&rdquo; she said firmly. &ldquo;You truly are
welcome to stay here, but when you leave, you must go immediately
to a village. Traveling about isn&rsquo;t safe. The same goes for you, my
Lady,&rdquo; she added to Faile. &ldquo;Trollocs are not something two women
should face with only a handful of men for protection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will think on it,&rdquo; Faile said calmly. &ldquo;I thank you
for your consideration.&rdquo; She sipped her tea, as unconcerned as
Verin, who had begun writing in her small book again, only looking
up to smile at Elisa and murmur, &ldquo;There are so many stories in the
countryside.&rdquo; Faile accepted a butter cookie from a young al&rsquo;Seen
girl, who curtsied and blushed furiously, all the while staring at
Faile in wide-eyed admiration.</p>

<p>Perrin grinned to himself. In her green riding silks,
they all took Faile for nobly born, and he had to admit she carried
it off beautifully. When she wanted to. The girl might not have
been so admiring had she seen her in one of her tempers, when her
tongue could flay the hide off a wagon driver.</p>

<p>Mistress al&rsquo;Seen turned to her husband, shaking her
head; Faile and Verin were not going to be convinced. Jac looked at
Tomas. &ldquo;Can you convince them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I go where she tells me.&rdquo; Tomas replied. Sitting
there with a teacup in his hand, the Warder still seemed on the
point of drawing his sword.</p>

<p>Master al&rsquo;Seen sighed and shifted his attention.
&ldquo;Perrin, most of us have met you one time or another, down to
Emond&rsquo;s Field, We know you, after a fashion. At least, we knew you
before you ran off last year. We&rsquo;ve heard some troubling things,
but I suppose Tam and Abell wouldn&rsquo;t be with you if they were
true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flann&rsquo;s wife, Adine, a plump woman with a
self-contented eye, sniffed sharply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard some things about
Tam and Abell, too. And about their boys, running off with Aes
Sedai. With Aes Sedai! A dozen of them! You all remember how
Emond&rsquo;s Field was burned to the ground. The Light knows what they
could have got up to. I heard tell they kidnapped the al&rsquo;Vere girl.&rdquo;
Flann shook his head resignedly and gave Jac an apologetic
look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you believe that,&rdquo; Wit said wryly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll
believe anything. I talked to Marin al&rsquo;Vere two weeks ago, and she
said her girl went off on her own hook. And there was only one Aes
Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you suggesting, Adine?&rdquo; Elisa al&rsquo;Seen put
her fists on her hips. &ldquo;Come out with it.&rdquo; There was more than a
hint of  &ldquo;I dare you&rdquo; in her voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say I believed it,&rdquo; Adine protested
stoutly, &ldquo;just that I heard it. There are questions to be asked.
The Children didn&rsquo;t latch on to those three by pulling names out of
a cap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you listen for a change,&rdquo; Elisa said firmly, &ldquo;you
might hear an answer or two.&rdquo; Adine set herself to rearranging her
skirts, but though she muttered to herself, she held her tongue
otherwise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does anyone else have anything to say?&rdquo; Jac asked
with barely concealed impatience. When no one spoke, he went on.
&ldquo;Perrin, no one here believes you a Darkfriend, any more than we
believe Tam or Abell is.&rdquo; He shot Adine a hard look, and Flann put
a hand on his wife&rsquo;s shoulder; she kept silent, but her lips
writhed with what she did not say. Jac muttered to himself before
continuing. &ldquo;Even so, Perrin, I think we have a right to hear why
the Whitecloaks are saying what they are. They accuse you and Mat
Cauthon and Rand al&rsquo;Thor of being Darkfriends. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faile opened her mouth angrily, but Perrin waved her
to silence. Her obedience surprised him so, he stared at her a
moment before speaking. Maybe she <em>was</em> ill. &ldquo;Whitecloaks
don&rsquo;t need much, Master al&rsquo;Seen. If you don&rsquo;t bow and scrape and
walk wide of them, you must be a Darkfriend. If you don&rsquo;t say what
they want, think what they want, you must be a Darkfriend. I don&rsquo;t
know why they think Rand and Mat are.&rdquo; That was the simple truth.
If the Whitecloaks knew Rand was the Dragon Reborn, that would be
enough for them, but there was no way they could know. Mat confused
him entirely. It had to be Fain&rsquo;s work. &ldquo;Myself, I killed some of
them.&rdquo; For a wonder, the gasps that rounded the room did not make
him cringe inside, and neither did the thought of what he had done.
&ldquo;They killed a friend of mine and would have killed me. I didn&rsquo;t
see my way clear to let them. That&rsquo;s the short of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can see where you wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Jac said slowly. Even
with Trollocs about, Two Rivers people were not used to killing.
Some years ago a woman had murdered her husband because she wanted
another man to marry her; that was the last time anybody had died
of violence in the Two Rivers that Perrin knew. Until the
Trollocs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Children of the Light,&rdquo; Verin said, &ldquo;are very
good at one thing. Making people who have been neighbors all their
lives suspicious of each other.&rdquo; All the farm folk looked at her,
some nodding after a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have a man with them, I hear,&rdquo; Perrin said.
&ldquo;Padan Fain. The peddler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard,&rdquo; Jac said. &ldquo;I hear he calls himself by
some other name nowadays. &rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin nodded. &ldquo;Ordeith. But Fain or Ordeith, he <em>
is</em> a Darkfriend. He admitted as much, admitted to bringing the
Trollocs on Winternight last year. And he rides with the
Whitecloaks. &rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very easy for you to claim,&rdquo; Adine Lewin said
sharply. &ldquo;You can name anybody Darkfriend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So who do you believe?&rdquo; Tomas said. &ldquo;Those who came
a few weeks ago, arrested people you know, and burned their farms?
Or a young man who grew up right here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am no Darkfriend, Master al&rsquo;Seen,&rdquo; Perrin said,
&ldquo;but if you want me to go, I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Elisa said quickly, shooting her husband a
meaningful glance. And Adine a freezing one that made her swallow
what she had been about to say. &ldquo;No. You are welcome to stay here
as long as you like.&rdquo; Jac hesitated, then nodded agreement. She
came over and looked down at Perrin, resting her hands on his
shoulders. &ldquo;You have our sympathy,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;Your father
was a good man. Your mother was my friend, and a fine woman. I know
she&rsquo;d want you stay with us, Perrin. The Children seldom come this
way, and if they do, the boys on the roof will give us plenty of
warning to get you into the attic. You will be safe here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She meant it. She actually meant it. And when Perrin
looked at Master al&rsquo;Seen, he nodded again. &ldquo;Thank you, &ldquo;Perrin
said, his throat tight. &ldquo;But I have&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;things to do. Things I
have to take care of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sighed, patting him gently. &ldquo;Of course. Just you
be sure those things don&rsquo;t get you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;hurt. Well, at least I can
send you off with a full belly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were not enough tables in the house to seat
everyone for the midday meal, so bowls of lamb stew were handed out
with chunks of crusty bread and admonitions not to drip, and
everyone ate where they sat or stood. Before they were done eating,
a lanky boy with his wrists sticking out of his sleeves and a bow
taller than he was came bounding in. Perrin thought he was Win
Lewin, but he could not be sure; boys grew fast at that age. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
Lord Luc,&rdquo; the skinny boy exclaimed excitedly. &ldquo;Lord Luc is
coming.&rdquo;</p>
