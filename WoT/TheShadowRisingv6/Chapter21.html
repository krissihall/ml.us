<h4><em>Into the Heart</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>airen
nobility filled the great vaulted chamber with
its huge polished redstone columns, ten feet thick, rising into
shadowed heights above golden lamps hanging on golden chains. The
High Lords and Ladies were arrayed in a thick hollow circle under
the great dome at the chamber&rsquo;s heart with the lesser nobles ranked
behind, row on row back into the forest of columns, all in their
best velvets and silks and laces, wide sleeves and ruffed collars
and peaked hats, all murmuring uneasily so the towering ceiling
echoed the sounds of nervous geese. Only the High Lords themselves
had ever before been bidden to this place, called the Heart of the
Stone, and they had come only four times a year, at the twin
demands of law and custom. They came now, all who were not out in
the countryside somewhere, at the summons of their new lord, the
maker of law and breaker of custom.</p>

<p>The packed crowd gave way before Moiraine as soon as
they saw who she was, so she and Egwene moved in a pocket of open
space. Lan&rsquo;s absence irritated Moiraine. It was not like the man to
vanish when she might need him; his way usually was to watch over
her as if she could not fend for herself without a guardian. Had
she not been able to feel the bond linking them and known he could
not be very far from the Stone, she might have worried.</p>

<p>He fought the strings Nynaeve was tying to him as
hard as he had ever fought Trollocs in the Blight, but much as he
might deny it, that young woman had bound him as tightly as she
herself did, though in other ways. He might as well try tearing
steel with his hands as those ties. She was not jealous, exactly,
but Lan had been her sword arm, her shield and companion for too
many years for her to give him up lightly. <em>I have done what had
to be done, there. She will have him if I die, and not before.
Where is the man? What is he doing?</em></p>

<p>One red gowned lace-ruffed woman, a horse-faced Lady
of the Land called Leitha, drew her skirts away a bit too
assiduously, and Moiraine looked at her. Merely looked, without
slowing her step, but the woman shuddered and dropped her eyes.
Moiraine nodded to herself. She could accept that these people
hated Aes Sedai, but she would not endure open rudeness on top of
veiled slights. Besides, the rest shied back another step after
seeing Leitha faced down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you certain he said nothing of what he means to
announce?&rdquo; she asked quietly. In this gabble, no one three paces
away could have made out a word. The Tairens kept about that
distance now. She did not like being overheard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Egwene said just as softly. She sounded as
irritated as Moiraine felt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There have been rumors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rumors? What sort of rumors?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl was not that good at controlling her face
and voice; clearly she had not heard the tales of doings in the Two
Rivers. Betting that Rand had not, though, might be putting her
horse at a ten foot fence. &ldquo;You should bring him to confide in you.
He needs an attentive ear. It will help him, to talk out his
troubles with someone he can trust.&rdquo; Egwene gave her a sidelong
glance. She was becoming too sophisticated for such simple methods.
Still, Moiraine had spoken unadorned truth&mdash;the boy did need
someone to listen and by listening lighten his burdens&mdash;and
it might work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will not confide in anyone, Moiraine. He hides
his pains, and hopes he can deal with them before anyone notices.&rdquo;
Anger flashed across Egwene&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;The wool-brained mule!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine felt a momentary sympathy. The girl could
not be expected to accept Rand&rsquo;s strolling about arm in arm with
Elayne, kissing in corners where they thought themselves unseen.
And Egwene did not know the half, yet. Commiseration did not last.
There was too much of importance to deal with for the girl to be
fretting over what she could not have in any case.</p>

<p>Elayne and Nynaeve should be aboard the raker by now,
out of the way. Their voyage might eventually tell her if her
suspicions about the Windfinders were correct. That was a minor
point, though. At worst the pair had enough gold to buy a ship and
hire a crew&mdash;which might be necessary given the rumors of
Tanchico&mdash;with enough left for the bribes so often necessary
with Taraboner officials. Thom Merrilin&rsquo;s room was empty, and her
informants had reported him muttering about Tanchico on his way out
of the Stone; he would see they got a good crew and found the right
officials. The purported plan with Mazrim Taim was much the more
likely of the two, but her messages to the Amyrlin should have
taken care of that. The two young women could handle the much less
likely eventuality of a mysterious danger hidden in Tanchico, and
they were out of her hair and away from Rand. She only regretted
that Egwene had refused to go with them. Tar Valon would have been
best for all three, but Tanchico would do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speaking of wool-brained, do you mean to continue
with this plan to go into the Waste?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; the girl said, firmly. She needed to be back
in the Tower, training her strength. <em>What was Siuan thinking
of? She will probably give me one of those sayings about boats and
fish, when I can ask her</em>.</p>

<p>At least Egwene would be out of the way, too, and the
Aiel girl would look after her. Perhaps the Wise Ones really could
teach her something of Dreaming. That had been the most astounding
letter from them, not that she could afford to heed most of it.
Egwene&rsquo;s journey into the Waste might be useful in the long
run.</p>

<p>The last line of Tairens gave way, making a little
hollow, and she and Egwene faced the open area under the vast dome.
The nobles&rsquo; ill ease was most evident here; many studied their feet
like sulky children, and others stared at nothing, looking at
anything but where they were. Here was where <em>Callandor</em> had
been kept before Rand took it. Here beneath this dome, untouched by
any hand for more than three thousand years, untouchable by any
hand but that of the Dragon Reborn. Tairens did not like admitting
that the Heart of the Stone existed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor woman,&rdquo; Egwene murmured.</p>

<p>Moiraine followed the girl&rsquo;s gaze. The High Lady
Alteima, already gowned and ruffed and capped in shimmering white
as Tairen widows were though her husband still lingered, was
perhaps the most composed of all the nobles. She was a slender,
lovely woman, made more so by her small sad smile, with large brown
eyes and long black hair hanging halfway to her waist. A tall
woman, though Moiraine admitted she did tend to judge such things
by her own height, and rather too full bosomed. Cairhienin were not
a tall people, and she had been considered short even among
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, a poor woman,&rdquo; she said, but she did not mean
it for sympathy. It was good to see Egwene had not yet grown
sophisticated enough to see beneath the surface all the time. The
girl was already far less malleable than she should have been for
years yet. She needed to be shaped before she was hardened.</p>

<p>Thom had missed, with Alteima. Or perhaps he had not
wanted to see; he seemed to have a strange reluctance to move
against women. The High Lady Alteima was far more dangerous than
her husband or her lover, both of whom she had manipulated without
either knowing it. Perhaps more dangerous than anyone else in Tear,
man or woman. She would find others to use soon enough. It was
Alteima&rsquo;s style to remain in the background and pull strings.
Something would have to be done about her.</p>

<p>Moiraine shifted her gaze along the rows of High
Lords and Ladies, until she found Estanda, in brocaded yellow silks
with a large ivory lace ruff and a tiny matching cap. A certain
sternness marred the beauty of her face, and the occasional glances
she gave Alteima were iron hard. Feelings between the two went
beyond mere rivalry; had they been men, one would have shed the
other&rsquo;s blood in a duel years since. If that antagonism could be
sharpened, Alteima would be too busy to make trouble for Rand.</p>

<p>For an instant she regretted sending Thom away. She
did not like having to waste her time with these petty affairs. But
he had too much influence with Rand; the boy had to depend on her
counsel. Hers, and hers alone. The Light knew he was difficult
enough without interference. Thom had been settling the boy down to
rule Tear when he needed to be moving on to greater things. But
that was dealt with for now. The problem of bringing Thom Merrilin
to heel could be managed later. Rand was the dilemma now. What did
he mean to announce?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is he? He has learned the first art of kings,
it seems. Making people wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not realize she had spoken aloud until Egwene
gave her a startled look. She smoothed the irritation from her face
immediately. Rand would appear eventually, and she would learn what
he meant to do. Learn along with everyone else. She nearly ground
her teeth. That blind fool of a boy, running headlong through the
night with never a care for cliffs, never thinking he could carry
the world over as well as himself. If only she could keep him from
rushing back to save his village. He would want to, but he could
not afford to do so now. Perhaps he did not know; it could be
hoped.</p>

<p>Mat stood across from them, uncombed and slouching
with his hands in the pockets of his high collared green coat. It
was half-unbuttoned, as usual, and his boots were scuffed, in sharp
contrast to the precise elegance around him. He shifted nervously
as he saw her looking at him, then gave one of his rudely defiant
grins. At least he was here, under her eye. Mat Cauthon was an
exhausting young man to keep track of, avoiding her spies with
ease; he never gave any sign that he knew they were there, but her
eyes and ears reported that he seemed to slide out of sight
whenever they got too close.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think he sleeps in his coats,&rdquo; Egwene said
disapprovingly. &ldquo;On purpose. I wonder where Perrin is.&rdquo; She went on
tiptoes, trying to search over the heads of the assemblage. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t see him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frowning, Moiraine scanned the crowd, not that she
could make out much beyond the front row. Lan could have been back
among the columns. She would not strain, though, or jump up on her
toes like an anxious child. Lan was due a talking to he would not
soon forget when she laid hands on him. With Nynaeve tugging at him
one way and <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>&mdash;Rand, at least&mdash;seemingly pulling another, she sometimes wondered how well their
bond still held. At least his time with Rand was useful; it gave
her another string to the young man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he is with Faile,&rdquo; Egwene said. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t
have run away, Moiraine. Perrin has a strong sense of duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Almost as strong as a Warder&rsquo;s, Moiraine knew, which
was why she did not keep eyes and ears on him as she tried to with
Mat. &ldquo;Faile has been trying to talk him into leaving, girl.&rdquo; Quite
possibly he was with her; he usually was. &ldquo;Do not look so
surprised. They often talk&mdash;and argue&mdash;where they can
be overheard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not surprised you know,&rdquo; Egwene said dryly,
&ldquo;only that Faile would try to talk him out of what he knows he has
to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she does not believe it as he does.&rdquo;
Moiraine had not believed it herself, at first, had not seen it.
Three <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, all the same age, coming out of one
village; she must have been blind not to realize they had to be
connected. Everything had become much more complicated with that
knowledge. Like trying to juggle three of Thom&rsquo;s colored balls one
handed and blindfolded; she had seen Thom do that, but she would
not want to try. There was no guide to how they were connected, or
what they were supposed to do; the Prophecies never mentioned
companions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like her,&rdquo; Egwene said. &ldquo;She is good for him, just
what he needs. And she cares for him deeply.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose she does.&rdquo; If Faile became too
troublesome, Moiraine would have to have a talk with her, about the
secrets Faile had been keeping from Perrin. Or have one of her eyes
and ears do it. That should settle her down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say it as if you don&rsquo;t believe it. They love
each other, Moiraine. Can&rsquo;t you see that? Can&rsquo;t you even recognize
a human emotion when you see one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine gave her a firm look, one that settled her
on her heels in a satisfactory manner. The girl knew so little and
thought she knew so much. Moiraine was about to tell her so in
withering fashion when startled, even fearful, gasps rose from
among the Tairens.</p>

<p>The crowd gave way hurriedly, more than eagerly,
those in front ruthlessly forcing those behind farther back,
opening a wide passage to the space beneath the dome. Rand strode
down that corridor, looking straight ahead, imperious in a red coat
embroidered with golden scrolls up his sleeves, cradling <em>
Callandor</em> in his right arm like a scepter. It was not only he
that made the Tairens give way, though. Behind him came perhaps a
hundred Aiel, spears and arrow nocked bows in hand, <em>shoufa</em>
wrapped around their heads, black veils hiding everything but their
eyes. Moiraine thought she recognized Rhuarc at the front, just
behind Rand, but only by the way he moved. They were anonymous.
Ready for killing. Plainly, whatever he meant to say, Rand intended
to quell any resistance before it had a chance to coalesce.</p>

<p>The Aiel halted, but Rand kept on until he stood
centered under the dome, then ran his eye around the gathering. He
seemed surprised, and perhaps upset, at the sight of Egwene, but he
gave Moiraine an infuriating smile, and Mat one that made the pair
of them look like boys when Mat returned it. The Tairens were white
faced, not knowing whether to stare at Rand and <em>Callandor</em>
or the veiled Aiel; either could be death in their midst.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The High Lord Sunamon,&rdquo; Rand said suddenly, and
loudly, making that plump fellow jump, &ldquo;has guaranteed me a treaty
with Mayene, strictly following lines I gave him. He has guaranteed
this with his life.&rdquo; He laughed as if he had made a joke, and most
of the nobles laughed with him. Not Sunamon, who looked distinctly
ill. &ldquo;If he fails,&rdquo; Rand announced, &ldquo;he has agreed to be hanged,
and he will be obliged.&rdquo; The laughter stopped. Sunamon&rsquo;s face took
on a sickly tinge of green. Egwene gave Moiraine a troubled glance;
she was gripping her skirt with both hands. Moiraine only waited;
he had not brought every noble within ten miles together to tell
them of a treaty or threaten a fat fool. She made her hands let go
of her own skirts.</p>

<p>Rand turned in a circle, weighing the faces he saw.
&ldquo;Because of this treaty, ships will soon be available to carry
Tairen grain west, to find new markets.&rdquo; There were a few
appreciative murmurs at that, quickly stifled. &ldquo;But there is more.
The armies of Tear are to march.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A cheer rose, tumultuous shouts ringing from the
ceilings. Men capered, even the High Lords, and shook their fists
over their heads, and tossed up peaked velvet hats. Women, smiling
as rapturously as the men, bestowed kisses on the cheeks of those
who would go to war, and delicately sniffed the tiny porcelain
bottles of smelling salts no Tairen noblewoman would be without,
pretending to be made faint by the news. &ldquo;Illian shall fall!&rdquo;
someone cried, and hundreds of voices seized it like thunder.
&ldquo;Illian shall fall! Illian shall fall! Illian shall fall!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine saw Egwene&rsquo;s lips moving, the words crushed
beneath the jubilation. She could read them, though. &ldquo;No, Rand.
Please, no. Please don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; On the far side of Rand, Mat was
frowning in disapproving silence. They and she were the only ones
not celebrating, aside from the ever watchful Aiel and Rand
himself. Rand&rsquo;s smile was twisted contemptuously, and never touched
his eyes. There was fresh sweat on his face. She met his sardonic
stare and waited. There would be more, and not, she suspected, to
her liking.</p>

<p>Rand raised his left hand. Slowly quiet fell, those
in front anxiously shushing those behind. He waited for absolute
silence. &ldquo;The armies will move north, into Cairhien. The High Lord
Meilan will command, and under him, the High Lords Gueyam, Aracome,
Hearne, Maraconn and Simaan. The armies will be generously financed
by the High Lord Torean, the wealthiest of you, who will accompany
the armies to see that his money is spent wisely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dead silence greeted this pronouncement. No one
moved, though plain-faced Torean seemed to be having trouble
standing.</p>

<p>Moiraine had to give Rand a mental bow for his
choices. Sending those seven out of Tear neatly eviscerated the
seven most dangerous plots against him, and none of those men
trusted each other enough to scheme among themselves. Thom Merrilin
had given him good advice; obviously her spies had missed some of
the notes he had had slipped into Rand&rsquo;s pockets. But the rest? It
was madness. He could not have had this for an answer on the other
side of that <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. It was not possible, surely.</p>

<p>Meilan obviously agreed with her, if not for the same
reasons. He stepped forward hesitantly, a lean hard man but so
frightened that the whites of his eyes showed all the way around.
&ldquo;My Lord Dragon&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He stopped, swallowed, and began again in a
marginally stronger voice. &ldquo;My Lord Dragon, intervening in a civil
war is stepping into a bog. A dozen factions contend for the Sun
Throne, with as many shifting alliances, each one betrayed every
day. Besides that, bandits infest Cairhien as fleas on a wild boar.
Starving peasants have stripped the land bare. I am reliably
informed that they eat bark and leaves. My Lord Dragon, &lsquo;a
quagmire&rsquo; barely begins to describe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand cut him off. &ldquo;You do not want to extend Tear&rsquo;s
sway all the way to Kinslayer&rsquo;s Dagger, Meilan? That is all right.
I know who I mean to sit on the Sun Throne. You do not go to
conquer, Meilan, but to restore order, and peace. And to feed the
hungry. There is more grain in the granaries now than Tear could
sell, and the farmers will harvest as much more this year, unless
you disobey me. Wagons will carry it north behind the armies, and
those <em>peasants</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;those <em>peasants</em> will not have
to eat bark any longer, my <em>Lord</em> Meilan.&rdquo; The tall High
Lord opened his mouth again, and Rand swung <em>Callandor</em>
down, grounding its crystal point in front of him. &ldquo;You have a
question, Meilan?&rdquo; Shaking his head, Meilan backed into the crowd
as though trying to hide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew he would not start a war,&rdquo; Egwene said
fiercely. &ldquo;I knew it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think there will be less killing in this?&rdquo;
Moiraine muttered. What was the boy up to? At least he was not
running off to save his village while the Forsaken had their way
with the rest of the world. &ldquo;The corpses will be piled as high,
girl. You will not know the difference between this and a war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Attacking Illian and Sammael would have gained him
time even if it grew into a stalemate. Time to learn his power, and
perhaps to bring down one of his strongest enemies, to cow the
rest. What did he gain by this? Peace for the land of her birth,
starving Cairhienin fed; she would have applauded another time. It
was laudably humane&mdash;and utterly senseless, now. Useless bloodshed,
rather than confronting an enemy who would destroy him given the
slightest opening. Why? Lanfear. What had Lanfear said to him? What
had she done? The possibilities chilled Moiraine&rsquo;s heart. Rand
would take closer watching than ever now. She would not allow him
to turn to the Shadow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; Rand said as if just remembering
something. &ldquo;Soldiers don&rsquo;t know much about feeding hungry people,
do they? For that, I think a kind, woman&rsquo;s heart is needed. My Lady
Alteima, I regret intruding on your grief, but will you undertake
to oversee distributing the food? You will have a nation to
feed.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>And power to gain</em>, Moiraine thought. This
was his first slip. Aside from deciding on Cairhien over Illian, of
course. Alteima would certainly return to Tear on an equal footing
with Meilan or Gueyam, ready for more plotting. She would have Rand
assassinated before that, if he was not careful. Perhaps an
accident could be arranged in Cairhien.</p>

<p>Alteima swept a graceful curtsy, spreading her full
white skirts, only a touch of her surprise showing. &ldquo;As my Lord
Dragon commands, so do I obey. It will please me greatly to serve
the Lord Dragon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was sure it would,&rdquo; Rand said wryly. &ldquo;As much as
you love your husband, you&rsquo;ll not want him with you in Cairhien.
Conditions will be hard, for a sick man. I took the liberty of
having him moved to the High Lady Estanda&rsquo;s apartments. She will
care for him while you are away, and send him to meet you in
Cairhien when he is well.&rdquo; Estanda smiled, a tight smile of
triumph. Alteima&rsquo;s eyes rolled back in her head, and she crumpled
in a heap.</p>

<p>Moiraine shook her head slightly. He truly was harder
than he had been. More dangerous. Egwene started toward the fallen
woman, but Moiraine put a hand on her arm. &ldquo;I think she was only
overcome by emotion. I can recognize it, you see. The ladies are
tending her.&rdquo; Several of them had clustered around, patting
Alteima&rsquo;s wrists and passing smelling salts under her nose. She
coughed and opened her eyes, and looked ready to faint again when
she saw Estanda standing over her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand just did something very clever, I think,&rdquo;
Egwene said in a flat voice. &ldquo;And very cruel. He has a right to
look ashamed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand did look it at that, grimacing at the
floorstones under his boots. Perhaps he was not as hard as he was
trying to be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not undeserved, however,&rdquo; Moiraine observed. The
girl showed promise, picking up on what she did not understand. But
she still needed to learn to control her emotions, to see what had
to be done as well as she saw what she wished could be done. &ldquo;Let
us hope he is finished with being clever for today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very few in the great chamber understood exactly what
had happened, only that Alteima&rsquo;s fainting had upset the Lord
Dragon. A few in the back raised shouts of &ldquo;Cairhien shall fall!&rdquo;
but the cry did not take hold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With you to lead us, my Lord Dragon, we shall
conquer the world!&rdquo; a lumpy faced young man shouted, half-supporting
Torean. Estean, Torean&rsquo;s eldest son; the lumpy-faced
resemblance was clear, though the father was still mumbling to
himself.</p>

<p>Jerking his head up, Rand appeared startled. Or
perhaps angry. &ldquo;I will not be with you. I am&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;going away for a
time.&rdquo; That certainly brought silence again. Every eye was on him,
but his attentions were all on <em>Callandor</em>. The crowd
flinched as he lifted the crystal blade before his face. Sweat
rolled down his face, much more sweat than before. &ldquo;The Stone held
<em>Callandor</em> before I came. The Stone should hold it again,
until I return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly the transparent sword blazed in his hands.
Whirling it hilt uppermost, he drove it down. Into the stone floor.
Bluish lightning arced wildly toward the dome above. The stone
rumbled loudly, and the Stone shook, dancing, heaving screaming
people from their feet.</p>

<p>Moiraine pushed Egwene off of her while tremors still
reverberated through the chamber, and scrambled erect. What <em>
had</em> he done? And why? Going away? It was the worst of all her
nightmares.</p>

<p>The Aiel had already regained their feet. Everyone
else lay stunned or huddled on hands and knees. Except for Rand. He
was on one knee, both hands holding <em>Callandor&rsquo;s</em> hilt, with
the blade driven halfway into the floorstones. The sword was clear
crystal again. Sweat glistened on his face. He pried his hands away
one finger at a time, held them cupped around the hilt yet not
touching it. For a moment Moiraine thought he was going to take
hold of it again, but instead he forced himself to his feet. He did
have to force himself; she was certain of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at this while I am gone.&rdquo; His voice was
lighter, more the way it had been when she first found him in his
village, but no less sure or firm than it had been moments before.
&ldquo;Look at it, and remember me. Remember I will come back for it. If
anyone wants to take my place, all they have to do is pull it out.&rdquo;
He waggled a finger at them, grinning almost mischievously. &ldquo;But
remember the price of failure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turning on his heel, he marched out of the chamber,
the Aiel falling in behind him. Staring at the sword rising out of
the floor of the Heart, the Tairens got to their feet more slowly.
Most looked ready to run, but too frightened to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That man!&rdquo; Egwene grumbled, dusting off her green
linen dress. &ldquo;Is he mad?&rdquo; She clapped a hand to her mouth. &ldquo;Oh,
Moiraine, he isn&rsquo;t, is he? Is he? Not yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light send he is not,&rdquo; Moiraine muttered. She
could not take her eyes from the sword any more than the Tairens
could. The Light take the boy. Why could he not have remained the
amenable youngling she had found in Emond&rsquo;s Field? She made herself
start after Rand. &ldquo;But I will find out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Half-running, they caught up quickly in a broad,
tapestry lined hallway. The Aiel, veils hanging loose now but
easily raised if needed, moved aside without slowing. They glanced
at her, and at Egwene, hard faces unchanging but eyes touched by
the wariness Aiel always had around Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>How they could be uneasy at her while calmly
following Rand, she did not understand. Learning more than
fragments about them was difficult. They answered questions freely&mdash;about anything that was of no interest to her. Her
informants and her own eavesdropping overheard nothing, and her
network of eyes and ears would no longer try. Not since one woman
had been left bound and gagged, hanging by her ankles from
battlements and staring wild eyed at the four hundred foot drop
beneath her, and not since the man who had simply disappeared. The
man was just gone; the woman, refusing to go higher than the ground
floor, had been a constant reminder until Moiraine sent her into
the country.</p>

<p>Rand did not slow down any more than the Aiel when
she and Egwene fell in on either side of him. His glance was wary,
too, but in a different way, and touched with exasperated anger. &ldquo;I
thought you were gone,&rdquo; he said to Egwene. &ldquo;I thought you went with
Elayne and Nynaeve. You should have. Even Tanchico is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Why did
you stay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be staying much longer,&rdquo; Egwene said. &ldquo;I am
going to the Waste with Aviendha, to Rhuidean, to study with the
Wise Ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He missed a step as the girl mentioned the Waste,
glancing at her uncertainly, then strode on. He seemed composed
now, too much so, a boiling teakettle with the lid strapped down
and the spout plugged. &ldquo;Do you remember swimming in the Waterwood?&rdquo;
he said quietly. &ldquo;I used to float on my back in a pool and think
the hardest thing I&rsquo;d ever have to do was plow a field, unless
maybe it was shearing sheep. Shearing from sunup till bedtime,
hardly stopping to eat until the clip was in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spinning,&rdquo; Egwene said. &ldquo;I hated it worse than
scrubbing floors. Twisting the threads makes your fingers so
sore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you do it?&rdquo; Moiraine demanded before they
could go on with this childhood reminiscing.</p>

<p>He gave her a sidelong look, and a smile mocking
enough to belong to Mat. &ldquo;Could I really have hung her, for trying
to kill a man who was plotting to kill me? Would there be more
justice in that than in what I did?&rdquo; The grin slid from his face.
&ldquo;Is there justice in anything I do? Sunamon will hang if he fails.
Because I said so. He&rsquo;ll deserve it after the way he&rsquo;s tried to
take advantage, with never a care if his own people starved, but
he&rsquo;ll not go to the gallows for that. He will hang because I said
he would. Because I said it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene laid a hand on his arm, but Moiraine would not
allow him to sidestep. &ldquo;You know that is not what I mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He nodded; this time his smile had a frightening,
rictus quality. &ldquo;<em>Callandor</em>. With that in my hands, I can
do anything. Anything. I know I can do anything. But now, it&rsquo;s a
weight off my shoulders. You don&rsquo;t understand, do you?&rdquo; She did
not, though it nettled her that he saw it. She kept silent, and he
went on. &ldquo;Perhaps it will help if you know it comes from the
Prophecies.</p>

<p class="verse_quote">&ldquo;Into the heart he thrusts his sword,<br>
into the heart, to hold their hearts.<br>
Who draws it out shall follow after,<br>
What hand can grasp that fearful blade?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see? Straight from the Prophecies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You forget one thing,&rdquo; she told him tightly. &ldquo;You
drew <em>Callandor</em> in fulfillment of prophecy. The safeguards
that held it awaiting you for three thousand years and more are
gone. It is the Sword That Cannot Be Touched no longer. I could
channel it free myself. Worse, any of the Forsaken could. What if
Lanfear returns? She could use <em>Callandor</em> no more than I,
but she could take it.&rdquo; He did not react to the name. Because he
did not fear her&mdash;in which case he was a fool&mdash;or for
another reason? &ldquo;If Sammael or Rahvin or any male Forsaken puts his
hand on <em>Callandor</em>, he can wield it as well as you. Think
of facing the power you give up so casually. Think of that power in
the hands of the Shadow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I almost hope they&rsquo;ll try.&rdquo; A threatening light
shone in his eyes; they seemed gray storm clouds. &ldquo;There is a
surprise awaiting anyone who tries to channel <em>Callandor</em>
out of the Stone, Moiraine. Do not think of taking it to the Tower
for safekeeping; I could not make the trap pick and choose. The
Power is all it needs to spring and reset, ready to trap again. I
am not giving <em>Callandor</em> up forever. Just until I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He
took a deep breath. &ldquo;<em>Callandor</em> will stay there until I come
back for it. By being there, reminding them of who I am and what I
am, it makes sure I can come back without an army. A haven of
sorts, with the likes of Alteima and Sunamon to welcome me home. If
Alteima survives the justice her husband and Estanda will mete out,
and Sunamon survives mine. Light, what a wretched tangle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He could not make it selective, or would not? She was
determined not to underrate what he might be capable of. <em>
Callandor</em> belonged in the Tower, if he would not wield it as he
should, in the Tower till he would wield it. &ldquo;Just until&rdquo; what? He
had been intending to say something other than &ldquo;until I come back.&rdquo;
But what?</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where are you going? Or do you mean to keep it a
mystery?&rdquo; She was quietly vowing not to let him escape again, to
turn him somehow if he meant to go running off to the Two Rivers,
when he surprised her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a mystery, Moiraine. Not from you and Egwene,
anyway.&rdquo; He looked at Egwene and said one word. &ldquo;Rhuidean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wide-eyed, the girl appeared as astounded as if she
had never heard the name before. For that matter, Moiraine felt
scarcely less. There was a murmur among the Aiel, but when she
glanced back they were striding along with no expression
whatsoever. She wished she could make them leave, but they would
not go at her command, and she would not ask Rand to send them
away. It would not help her with him to ask favors, especially when
he might well refuse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not an Aiel clan chief, Rand,&rdquo; she said
firmly, &ldquo;and have no need to be one. Your struggle is on this side
of the Dragonwall. Unless&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Does this come from your answers
in the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>? Cairhien, and <em>Callandor</em>, and
Rhuidean? I told you those answers can be cryptic. You could be
misunderstanding them, and that could prove fatal. To more than
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must trust me, Moiraine. As I have so often had
to trust you.&rdquo; His face might as well have belonged to an Aiel for
all she could read in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will trust you for now. Just do not wait to seek
my guidance until it is too late.&rdquo; <em>I will not let you go to the
Shadow. I have worked too long to allow that. Whatever it
takes</em>.</p>
