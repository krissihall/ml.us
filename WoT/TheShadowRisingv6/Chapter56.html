<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
common room of the Winespring Inn was silent but
for the scratch of Perrin&rsquo;s pen. Silent, and empty but for him and
Aram. Late-morning light made small pools beneath the windows. No
cooking smells came from the kitchen; there were no fires lit
anywhere in the village, and even coals banked in ashes had been
doused. No point in giving the gift of fire easy to hand. The
Tinker&mdash;he sometimes wondered whether it was proper to think
of Aram that way any longer, but a man could not stop being what he
was, sword or no&mdash;stood against the wall by the front door,
watching Perrin. What did the man expect? What did he want? Dipping
his pen in the small stone ink jar, Perrin set aside the third
sheet of paper and began a fourth.</p>

<p>Pushing through the door, bow in hand, Ban al&rsquo;Seen
rubbed an uneasy finger up and down his big nose. &ldquo;The Aiel are
back,&rdquo; he said quietly, but his feet moved as if he could not make
them be still. &ldquo;Trollocs coming, from north and south. Thousands of
them, Lord Perrin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me that,&rdquo; Perrin said absently, frowning
at the page. He had no way with words. He certainly did not know
how to say things in the fancy way women liked. All he could was
write what he felt. Dipping the pen again, he added a few
lines.</p>

<p class="note">I will not ask your forgiveness for what I did. I do not
know if you could give it, but I will not ask. You are more
precious to me than life. Never think I have abandoned you. When
the sun shines on you, it is my smile. When you hear the breeze
stir through the apple blossoms, it is my whisper that I love you.
My love is yours forever.</p>

<p class="note_sig">Perrin</p>

<p>For a moment he studied what he had written. It did
not say enough, but it would have to do. He did not have the right
words any more than he had time.</p>

<p>Carefully blotting the damp ink with sand, he folded
the pages together. He very nearly wrote &ldquo;Faile Bashere&rdquo; on the
outside before making it &ldquo;Faile Aybara.&rdquo; He realized he did not
even know if a wife took her husband&rsquo;s name in Saldaea; there were
places where they did not. Well, she had married him in the Two
Rivers; she would have to put up with Two Rivers customs.</p>

<p>He placed the letter in the middle of the mantel over
the fireplace&mdash;perhaps it would reach her eventually&mdash;and adjusted the wide red marriage ribbon behind his collar so it
hung down his lapels properly. He was supposed to wear it for seven
days, an announcement to everyone who saw him that he was newly
wed. &ldquo;I will try,&rdquo; he told the letter softly. Faile had tried to
tie one in his beard; he wished he had let her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon, Lord Perrin?&rdquo; Ban said, still shifting his
feet anxiously. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear.&rdquo; Aram was chewing his lip, his eyes
wide and frightened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time to see to the day&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; Perrin said. Perhaps
the letter would reach her. Somehow. He took his bow from the table
and slung it on his back. Axe and quiver already hung at his belt.
&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t call me that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In front of the inn, the Companions were gathered on
their horses, Wil al&rsquo;Seen with that fool wolfhead banner, the long
staff resting on his stirrup iron. How long since Wil had refused
to carry the thing? The survivors of those who had joined him the
first day jealously guarded the right, now. Wil, with his bow on
his back and a sword at his hip, looked proud as an idiot.</p>

<p>As Ban scrambled into his saddle, Perrin heard him
say, &ldquo;The man is as cool as a winter pond. Like ice. Maybe it won&rsquo;t
be so bad today.&rdquo; He barely paid attention. The women were gathered
on the Green.</p>

<p>They made a circle five or six deep around the tall
pole where the larger red wolfhead flapped out in a breeze. Five or
six deep, shoulder to shoulder, with polearms made from scythes and
pitchforks, and wood-axes, and even stout kitchen knives and
cleavers.</p>

<p>Throat tight, he mounted Stepper and rode toward
them. The children were a tight mass inside the circle of women.
All the children in Emond&rsquo;s Field.</p>

<p>Riding slowly along the ranks, he felt the women&rsquo;s
eyes following him, and the children&rsquo;s. Fear scent, and worry; the
children showed it on their too-pale faces, but all smelled of it.
He reined in where Marin al&rsquo;Vere and Daise Congar and the rest of
the Women&rsquo;s Circle stood together. Alsbet Luhhan had one of her
husband&rsquo;s hammers on her shoulder, and her Whitecloak helmet
acquired the night of her rescue sat slightly crooked because of
her thick braid. Neysa Ayellin held a long-bladed carving knife
firm in her hand, and had two more stuck behind her belt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have planned this out,&rdquo; Daise said, looking up at
him as if she expected an argument and did not intend to allow it.
She held a pitchfork, fastened to a pole nearly three feet taller
than she, upright in front of her. &ldquo;If the Trollocs break through
anywhere, you men are going to be busy, so we will take the
children out. The older ones know what to do, and they&rsquo;ve all
played hide-and-seek in the woods. Just to keep them safe until
they can come out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The older ones. Boys and girls of thirteen and
fourteen had toddlers strapped on their backs, and held smaller
children by the hand. Girls older than that stood in the ranks with
the women; Bode Cauthon had a wood-axe gripped in both hands, her
sister Eldrin a boar spear with a broad point. Boys older were out
with the men, or up on the thatched rooftops with their bows. The
Tinkers were in with the children. Perrin glanced down at Aram,
standing by his stirrup. They would not fight, but each adult had
two babes fastened on his or her back and another cradled in the
crook of an elbow. Raen and Ila, each with an arm around the other,
would not look at him. Just to keep them safe until they could come
out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; He had to stop and clear his throat. He
had not meant it to come to this. Think as hard as he could,
nothing else came that he could have done. Even giving himself to
the Trollocs would not have stopped them killing and burning. The
end would have been the same. &ldquo;It was not fair, what I did with
Faile, but I had to. Please understand that. I had to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, Perrin,&rdquo; Alsbet said, voice emphatic
but round face smiling warmly. &ldquo;I can never abide it when you&rsquo;re
silly. Do you think we would expect you to do any different?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A heavy cleaver in one hand, Marin reached up to pat
his knee with the other. &ldquo;Any man worth cooking a meal for would
have done the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Light, but he sounded hoarse. In a
minute he would be snuffling like a girl. But for some reason he
could not smooth his voice. They must think him an idiot. &ldquo;Thank
you. I shouldn&rsquo;t have fooled you, but she&rsquo;d not have gone if she
suspected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Perrin.&rdquo; Marin laughed. She actually laughed,
with all they faced, and smelling of fear as she did; he wished he
had half her courage. &ldquo;We knew what you were up to before you ever
put her on her horse, and I am not sure she didn&rsquo;t as well. Women
do find themselves doing what they don&rsquo;t want just to please you
men. Now you go on and do what you have to. This is Women&rsquo;s Circle
business,&rdquo; she added firmly.</p>

<p>Somehow he managed to smile back at her. &ldquo;Yes,
mistress,&rdquo; he said, knuckling his forehead. &ldquo;Beg pardon. I know
enough to keep my nose out of that.&rdquo; The women around her laughed
in soft amusement as he turned Stepper away.</p>

<p>Ban and Tell were riding right behind him, he
realized, with the rest of the Companions strung out after Wil and
the banner. He motioned the pair to come up beside him. &ldquo;If things
go badly today,&rdquo; he said when they were on either side of him, &ldquo;the
Companions are to come back here and help the women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He cut Tell&rsquo;s protest short. &ldquo;You do what I say! If
it goes wrong, you get the women and children out! You hear me?&rdquo;
They nodded; reluctantly, but they did it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about you?&rdquo; Ban asked quietly.</p>

<p>Perrin ignored him. &ldquo;Aram, you stick with the
Companions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Striding along between Stepper and Tell&rsquo;s shaggy
horse, the Tinker did not even look up. &ldquo;I go where you go.&rdquo; He
said it simply, but his tone left no room for argument; he was
going to do as he wanted whatever Perrin said. Perrin wondered if
real lords ever had problems like this.</p>

<p>At the west end of the Green, the Whitecloaks were
all mounted, cloaks with the golden sunburst bright, helmets and
armor gleaming, lance points shining, a long column of fours that
stretched back between the nearest houses. They must have spent
half the night polishing. Dain Bornhald and Jaret Byar swung their
horses to face Perrin. Bornhald sat straight in his saddle, but he
smelled of apple brandy. Byar&rsquo;s gaunt face twisted with an even
deeper rage than usual as he stared at Perrin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you would be at your places by now,&rdquo;
Perrin said.</p>

<p>Bornhald frowned at his horse&rsquo;s mane, not answering.
After a moment, Byar spat, &ldquo;We are leaving here, Shadowspawn.&rdquo; An
angry mutter rose from the Companions, but the hollow-eyed man
ignored them as he did Aram&rsquo;s reaching over his shoulder to his
sword hilt. &ldquo;We will cut our way back to Watch Hill through your
friends and rejoin the rest of our men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leaving. Over four hundred soldiers, leaving.
Whitecloaks, but mounted soldiers, not farmers, soldiers who had
agreed&mdash;Bornhald had agreed!&mdash;to support the Two Rivers
men wherever the fighting was hottest. If Emond&rsquo;s Field was to have
any chance at all, he had to hang on to these men. Stepper tossed
his head and snorted as if catching his rider&rsquo;s mood. &ldquo;Do you still
believe I&rsquo;m a Darkfriend, Bornhald? How many attacks have you seen
so far? Those Trollocs have tried to kill me as much as anybody
else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bornhald raised his head slowly, eyes haunted and at
the same time half-glazed. Hands in steel-backed gauntlets flexed
on his reins unconsciously. &ldquo;Do you think I do not know by now that
these defenses were prepared without you? It was none of your
doing, yes? I will not keep my men here to watch you feed your own
villagers to the Trollocs. Will you dance atop a pile of their
bodies when it is done, Shadowspawn? Not ours! I mean to live long
enough to see you brought to justice!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin patted Stepper&rsquo;s neck to quiet the stallion.
He had to keep these men. &ldquo;You want me? Very well. When it&rsquo;s over,
when the Trollocs are done, I&rsquo;ll not resist if you try to arrest
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Ban and Tell shouted together, and growls built
behind them from the others. Aram peered up at Perrin,
stricken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An empty promise,&rdquo; Bornhald sneered. &ldquo;You mean
everyone to die here save yourself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never know if you run away, will you?&rdquo; Perrin
made his voice hard and contemptuous. &ldquo;I will keep my promise, but
if you run, you might never find me again. Run, if you want! Run,
and try to forget what happens here! All your talk of protecting
people from Trollocs. How many died at Trolloc hands after you
came? My family wasn&rsquo;t the first, and certainly not the last. Run!
Or stay, if you can remember you&rsquo;re men. If you need to find the
courage, look at the women, Bornhald. Any one of them is braver
than the whole lot of you Whitecloaks!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bornhald shook as though every word were a blow;
Perrin thought the man might fall out of his saddle. Swaying
upright, Bornhald stared at him. &ldquo;We will remain,&rdquo; he said
hoarsely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my Lord Bornhald,&rdquo; Byar protested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clean!&rdquo; Bornhald roared at him. &ldquo;If we must die
here, we will die clean!&rdquo; He wrenched his head back to Perrin,
spittle on his lips. &ldquo;We will remain. But at the last I will see
you dead, Shadowspawn! For <em>my</em> family, for <em>my</em>
father, I&mdash;will&mdash;see&mdash;you&mdash;<em>dead</em>!&rdquo; Sawing his horse around
roughly, he cantered back to his white-cloaked column. Byar bared
his teeth in a wordless snarl at Perrin before following.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not mean to keep that promise?&rdquo; Aram said
anxiously. &ldquo;You cannot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to check everyone,&rdquo; Perrin said. Small chance
he would live long enough to keep it. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much time.&rdquo; He
booted Stepper in the flanks and the horse leaped forward, toward
the west end of the village.</p>

<p>Behind the sharp stakes facing the Westwood, men
crouched with their spears and halberds and polearms fashioned by
Haral Luhhan, who was there in his blacksmith&rsquo;s vest with a scythe
blade on the end of an eight-foot shaft. Behind them stood the men
with bows in ranks broken by four catapults, Abell Cauthon walking
along slowly to speak to each man.</p>

<p>Perrin reined in beside Abell. &ldquo;Word is they&rsquo;re
coming from north and south,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;but keep a sharp
eye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll watch. And I&rsquo;m ready to send half my men
wherever they are needed. They&rsquo;ll not find Two Rivers folk easy
meat.&rdquo; Abell&rsquo;s grin was reminiscent of his son&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>To Perrin&rsquo;s embarrassment, the men raised a ragged
cheer as he rode by, with the Companions and the banner at his
heels: &ldquo;Goldeneyes! Goldeneyes!&rdquo; and now and then a &ldquo;Lord Perrin!&rdquo;
He knew he should have stamped harder on that in the beginning.</p>

<p>To the south, Tam had charge, more grim-faced than
Abell and striding almost like a Warder, hand resting on his sword
hilt. That wolfish, deadly grace looked strange on the blocky,
gray-haired farmer. Yet his words to Perrin were not so different
from Abell&rsquo;s. &ldquo;We Two Rivers folk are a tougher lot than most
know,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry we will not do ourselves
proud today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alanna was at one of the six catapults here, fussing
over a large stone being lifted into the cup on the end of the
thick arm. Ihvon sat his horse near her in his Warder&rsquo;s
color-changing cloak, slender as a steel blade and alert as a hawk;
there was no doubt he had chosen his ground&mdash;wherever Alanna
was&mdash;and his fight&mdash;to bring her out alive whatever. He
barely looked at Perrin. But the Aes Sedai paused, hands hovering
over the stone, eyes following him as he passed. He could all but
feel her weighing and measuring and judging. Those cheers followed
him, too.</p>

<p>Where the hedge of stakes ran beyond the few houses
east of the Winespring Inn, Jon Thane and Samel Crawe had charge
between them. Perrin told them what he had Abell, and once again
got much the same reply. Jon, in a mail shirt with holes rusted
through in several places, had seen the smoke of his mill burning,
and Samel, with his horse face and long nose, was sure he had seen
the smoke of his farm. Neither expected an easy day, but both wore
stony determination like cloaks.</p>

<p>It was to the north that Perrin had decided to make
his fight. Fingering the ribbon hanging down one lapel, he peered
in the direction of Watch Hill, the direction Faile had gone, and
wondered why he had chosen the north side. <em>Fly free, Faile. Fly
free, my heart</em>. He supposed it was good a place to die as
any.</p>

<p>Bran supposedly was in charge here, in his steel cap
and disc-sewn metal jerkin, but he stopped checking the men along
the hedge to give Perrin as much of a bow as his girth would allow.
Gaul and Chiad stood ready, heads wrapped in <em>shoufa</em> and
faces hidden to the eyes behind black veils. Side by side, Perrin
noted; whatever had passed between them, it seemed to outweigh
their clans&rsquo; blood feud. Loial had a pair of woodaxes, dwarfed in
his huge hands; his tufted ears thrust forward fiercely, and his
wide face was grim.</p>

<p><em>Do you think I would run</em> away? he had said
when Perrin suggested he could slip off into the night after Faile.
His ears had dropped with weariness and hurt. <em>I came with you,
Perrin, and I will stay until you go</em>. And then he had laughed
suddenly, a deep booming sound that almost rattled the dishes. <em>
Perhaps someone will even tell a story of me, one day. We do not go
in for such things, but there could be an Ogier hero, I suppose. A
joke, Perrin. I made a joke. Laugh. Come, we will tell each other
jokes, and laugh, and think of Faile flying free</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is no joke, Loial,&rdquo; Perrin murmured as he rode
along the lines of men, trying not to listen to their cheers. &ldquo;You
are a hero whether you want to be or not.&rdquo; The Ogier gave him a
tight, wide-mouthed grin before setting his eyes back on the
cleared ground beyond the hedge. White-striped sticks marked
hundred-pace intervals out to five hundred; beyond that lay quilted
fields, tabac and barley, most trampled in earlier attacks, and
hedges and low stone fences, and copses of leatherleaf, pine and
oak.</p>

<p>So many faces Perrin knew in those waiting ranks of
men. Stout Eward Candwin and lantern-jawed Paet al&rsquo;Caar with
spears. White-haired Buel Dowtry, the fletcher, stood with the
bowmen, of course. There was stocky, gray-haired Jac al&rsquo;Seen and
his bald cousin Wit, and gnarled Flann Lewin, a lanky beanpole like
all of his male kin. Jaim Torfinn and Hu Marwin, among the first to
ride after him; they had felt too uncomfortable to join the
Companions, as if missing the ambush in the Waterwood had opened
some gap between them and the others. Elam Dowtry, and Dav Ayellin,
and Ewin Finngar. Hari Coplin and his brother Darl, and old Bili
Congar. Berin Thane, the miller&rsquo;s brother, and fat Athan Dearn, and
Kevrim al&rsquo;Azar, whose grandsons had grown sons, and Tuck Padwhin,
the carpenter, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Making himself stop counting them, Perrin rode to
where Verin stood beside one of the catapults under the watchful eye
of Tomas on his gray. The plump, brown-clad Aes Sedai studied Aram
a moment before turning her birdlike gaze up to Perrin, one eyebrow
raised as if to question why he was bothering her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a little surprised to see you and Alanna still
here,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;Hunting girls who can learn to channel can&rsquo;t
be worth getting killed. Or keeping a string tied to a <em>
ta&rsquo;veren</em>, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that what we are doing?&rdquo; Folding her hands at her
waist, she tilted her head to one side thoughtfully. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said
at last, &ldquo;I do not think we could go quite yet. You are a very
interesting study, as much as Rand, in your own way. And young Mat.
Could I only split myself into three, I would latch one onto each
of you and follow you every moment of the day and night even if I
had to marry you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I already have a wife.&rdquo; It felt odd, saying that.
Odd, and good. He had a wife, and she was safe.</p>

<p>She shattered his moment of reverie. &ldquo;Yes, you do.
But you do not know what marrying Zarine Bashere means, do you?&rdquo;
She reached up to turn his axe in its loop on his belt, studying
it. &ldquo;When are you going to give this up for the hammer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Staring at the Aes Sedai, he reined Stepper back a
pace, pulling the axe out of her hands, before he knew it. What
marrying Faile <em>meant</em>? Give up the axe? What did she mean?
What did she know?</p>

<p>&ldquo;ISAM!&rdquo; The guttural roar rose like thunder, and
Trollocs appeared, each half again as tall as a man and twice as
wide, trotting into the fields to halt beyond bowshot, a hulking,
black-mailed mass, deep and stretching the length of the village.
Thousands of them packed together, huge faces distorted by beaks
and snouts, heads with horns or feathered crests, spikes at elbows
and shoulders, scythe-curved swords and spiked axes, hooked spears
and barbed tridents, a seemingly endless sea of cruel weapons.
Behind them, Myrddraal galloped up and down on midnight horses,
raven-black cloaks hanging undisturbed as they whirled their
mounts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;ISAM!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Interesting,&rdquo; Verin murmured.</p>

<p>Perrin would not have thought that was the word. This
was the first time the Trollocs had shouted anything
understandable. Not that he had any idea what it meant.</p>

<p>Smoothing his marriage ribbon, he forced himself to
ride calmly to the center of the Two Rivers line. The Companions
formed behind him, the breeze lifting the banner with its red
wolfhead. Aram had his sword out in both hands. &ldquo;Be ready!&rdquo; Perrin
called. His voice was steady; he could not believe it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;ISAM!&rdquo; And the black tide rolled forward, howling
wordlessly.</p>

<p>Faile was safe. Nothing else mattered. He would not
let himself see the faces of the men stretched out to either side
of him. He heard the same howls drifting from the south. Both
sides at once. They had never tried that before. Faile was safe.
&ldquo;At four hundred paces&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&rdquo; All along the ranks, bows rose
together. Closer the howling mass came, long thick legs eating
ground. Closer. &ldquo;Loose!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The snap of bowstrings was lost in the Trolloc roar,
but a goose-fletched hail streaked the sky as it arced out, plunged
down into the black-mailed horde. Stones from the catapults erupted
in fiery balls and sharp splinters in those seething ranks.
Trollocs fell. Perrin saw them go down, trampled beneath boots and
hooves. Even some Myrddraal fell. Yet the tidal wave rushed on,
closing holes and gaps, apparently undiminished.</p>

<p>There was no need to order another volley. A second
followed the first as quickly as men could nock arrows, a second
rain of broadhead points rising before the first dropped, the third
following behind, the fourth, the fifth. Fire exploded among the
Trollocs as fast as the catapult arms could be winched down, Verin
galloping from catapult to catapult to lean down from her saddle.
And the huge bellowing forms came on, crying in no language Perrin
understood, but crying for blood, human blood and flesh. Men
crouching behind the stakes readied themselves, hefting their
weapons.</p>

<p>Perrin felt cold inside. He could see the ground
behind the Trolloc charge already littered with their dead and
dying, yet it hardly seemed they were fewer. Stepper pranced
nervously, but he could not hear the dun&rsquo;s whicker for the rolling
howls of Trollocs. The axe came into his hand smoothly, long
half-moon blade and thick spike catching the sunlight. Not midday
yet. <em>My heart is yours forever, Faile</em>. This time, he did
not think the stakes would&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not even slowing, the front rank of Trollocs ran onto
the sharp stakes, faces contorted by snouts or beaks twisting with
pained shrieks, howling as they were impaled, driven down by more
huge shapes scrambling up over their backs, some of those falling
among the stakes, replaced by more, always more. One last volley of
arrows drove home at point-blank range, and then it was the spears
and halberds and home-made polearms, thrusting and stabbing at
towering forms in black mail, sometimes falling while the bowmen
shot as best they could at the inhuman faces above their friends&rsquo;
heads, boys shooting down from the rooftops as well, madness and
death and earsplitting roars and screams and howls. Slowly,
inexorably, the Two Rivers line bulged inward at a dozen places. If
it broke, anywhere&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fall back!&rdquo; Perrin bellowed. A boar-snouted Trolloc,
already bleeding, forced its way through the ranks of men,
shrieking and striking with its thick, curved sword. Perrin&rsquo;s axe
split its head to the snout. Stepper was trying to rear, screaming
silently in the din. &ldquo;Fall back!&rdquo; Darl Coplin went down, clutching
a thigh transfixed by a wrist-thick spear; old Bili Congar tried to
drag him backward while awkwardly wielding a boar spear; Hari
Coplin swung his halberd in defense of his brother, mouth wide in a
seemingly soundless shout. &ldquo;Fall back between the houses!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was not sure whether others heard and passed the
order, or the mountainous weight of Trollocs simply pressed in, but
slowly, one grudging step at a time, the humans moved back. Loial
swung his bloodied axes like mallets, wide mouth snarling. Beside
the Ogier, Bran thrust his spear grimly; he had lost his steel cap,
and blood ran in his fringe of gray hair. From his stallion Tomas
carved a space around Verin; hair in wild disarray, she had lost
her horse; balls of fire streaked from her hands, and every Trolloc
struck exploded in flames as if soaked in oil. Not enough to hold.
The Two Rivers men edged back, jostling around Stepper. Gaul and
Chiad fought back-to-back; she had only one spear left, and he
slashed and stabbed with his heavy knife. Back. To west and east
men had curved out from the defenses there to keep the Trollocs
from flanking them, pouring arrows in. Not enough. Back.</p>

<p>Suddenly a huge ram-horned shape was trying to pull
Perrin out of the saddle, trying to climb up after him. Thrashing,
Stepper went down under the combined weight. Leg pinned and pained
near to breaking, Perrin struggled to bring his axe around, to
fight hands bigger than an Ogier&rsquo;s away from his throat. The
Trolloc screamed as Aram&rsquo;s sword sliced into its neck. Even as it
collapsed atop Perrin, spraying blood, the Tinker spun smoothly to
run another Trolloc through the middle.</p>

<p>Grunting with pain, Perrin kicked his way clear,
aided by Stepper scrambling to his feet, but there was no time to
think of remounting. He barely rolled aside as a black horse&rsquo;s
hooves stamped where his head had been. Pale, eyeless face
snarling, the Fade leaned from its saddle as he tried to rise,
dead-black sword slashing, brushing his hair as he dropped.
Ruthlessly he swung his axe, chopping one of the horse&rsquo;s legs out
from under it. Horse and rider toppled together; as they fell, he
buried his axe where the Halfman&rsquo;s eyes should have been.</p>

<p>He wrenched the blade free in time to see Daise
Congar&rsquo;s pitchfork tines take a goat-snouted Trolloc in the throat.
It seized the long shaft with one hand, stabbing a barbed spear at
her with the other, but Marin al&rsquo;Vere calmly hamstrung it with one
blow of her cleaver; the leg gave way, and she just as coolly
severed the Trolloc&rsquo;s spine at the base of its neck. Another
Trolloc lifted Bode Cauthon into the air by her braid; mouth wide
in a terrified scream, she sank her wood-axe into its mailed
shoulder just as her sister, Eldrin, thrust her boar spear through
its chest and gray-braided Neysa Ayellin drove a thick butchering
knife in as well.</p>

<p>All up and down the line, as far as Perrin could see,
the women were there. Their numbers were the only reason the line
still held, almost driven back against the houses. Women among the
men, shoulder to shoulder; some no more than girls, but then, some
of those &ldquo;men&rdquo; had never shaved yet. Some never would. Where were
the Whitecloaks? <em>The children!</em> If the women were here,
there was no one to get the children out. <em>Where are the bloody
Whitecloaks?</em> If they came now, at least they might buy another
few minutes. A few minutes to get the children away.</p>

<p>A boy, the same dark-haired runner who had come for
him the night before, seized his arm as he turned to search for the
Companions. The Companions had to try to cut a way out for the
children. He would send them, and do what he could here. &ldquo;Lord
Perrin!&rdquo; the boy shouted at him through the deafening din. &ldquo;Lord
Perrin!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin tried to shake him off, then snatched him up
kicking under one arm; he belonged with the other children. Split
up, in tight ranks stretching from house to house, Ban and Tell and
the other Companions were shooting from their saddles, over the
heads of the men and women. Wil had driven the banner&rsquo;s staff into
the ground so he could work his bow, too. Somehow, Tell had managed
to catch up Stepper; the dun&rsquo;s reins were tied to Tell&rsquo;s saddle.
The boy could go on Stepper&rsquo;s back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord Perrin! Please listen! Master al&rsquo;Thor says
somebody&rsquo;s attacking the Trollocs! Lord Perrin!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin was halfway to Tell, hobbling on his bruised
leg, when it penetrated. He stuffed the axe haft through his belt
to hoist the boy up in front of his face by the shoulders.
&ldquo;Attacking them? Who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Lord Perrin. Master al&rsquo;Thor said to
tell you he thought he heard somebody shouting &lsquo;Deven Ride.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aram grabbed Perrin&rsquo;s arm, wordlessly pointing with
his bloody sword. Perrin turned in time to see a hail of arrows
plunge into the Trollocs. From the north. Another flight was
already rising toward the top of its arc.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go back to the other children,&rdquo; he said, setting the
boy down. He had to be up where he could see. &ldquo;Go! You did well,
boy!&rdquo; he added as he ran awkwardly for Stepper. The little fellow
scampered back into the village grinning. Every step sent a jolt of
pain up Perrin&rsquo;s leg; maybe the thing <em>was</em> broken. He had
no time to worry about that.</p>

<p>Seizing the reins Tell tossed him, he hauled himself
up into his saddle. And wondered if he was seeing what he wanted to
see instead of what was really there.</p>

<p>Beneath a red-eagle banner at the edge of where the
fields had been stood long rows of men in farmer&rsquo;s clothes,
shooting their bows methodically. And beside the banner, Faile sat
Swallow&rsquo;s saddle, Bain at her stirrup. It had to be Bain behind
that black veil, and he could see Faile&rsquo;s face clearly. She looked
excited, fearful, terrified and exuberant. She looked
beautiful.</p>

<p>Myrddraal were trying to turn some of the Trollocs
around, trying to lead a charge against the Watch Hill men, but it
was useless. Even Trollocs who did turn went down before they
covered fifty strides. A Fade and its horse fell, not to arrows,
but to panicked Trolloc hands and spears. It was the Trollocs
moving back now, then running in a frenzy, fleeing shots from
both sides once the Emond&rsquo;s Field men had room to lift bows, too,
Trollocs falling, Myrddraal going down. It was a slaughter, but
Perrin hardly saw. Faile.</p>

<p>The same boy appeared at his stirrup. &ldquo;Lord Perrin!&rdquo;
he shouted. To be heard above cheering now, men and women shouting
for joy and relief as the last Trollocs who had not made it out of
bow range fell. Not many had, Perrin believed, but he was barely
able to think. Faile. The boy tugged at his breeches&rsquo; leg. &ldquo;Lord
Perrin! Master al&rsquo;Thor said to tell you the Trollocs are breaking!
And they <em>are</em> shouting &lsquo;Deven Ride&rsquo;! The men, I mean. I
heard them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin bent to ruffle the boy&rsquo;s curly hair. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
your name, lad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jaim Aybara, Lord Perrin. I&rsquo;m your cousin, I think.
Sort of, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin squeezed his eyes shut for a moment to keep
the tears in. Even when he opened them his hand still trembled on
the lad&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;Well, Cousin Jaim, you tell your children about
today. You tell your grandchildren, your grandchildren&rsquo;s
children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to have any,&rdquo; Jaim said stoutly.
&ldquo;Girls are horrible. They laugh at you, and they don&rsquo;t like to do
anything worth doing, and you never understand what they&rsquo;re
saying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think one day you&rsquo;ll find out they&rsquo;re the opposite
of horrible. Some of it won&rsquo;t change, but that will.&rdquo; Faile.</p>

<p>Jaim looked doubtful, but then he brightened, a wide
grin spreading across his face. &ldquo;Wait till I tell Had Lord Perrin
called me cousin!&rdquo; And he darted away to tell Had, who would have
children, too, and all the other boys who would, one day. The sun
stood straight overhead. An hour, maybe. It had all taken no more
than an hour. It felt like a lifetime.</p>

<p>Stepper moved forward, and he realized he must have
dug his heels in. Cheering people made way for the dun, and he
hardly heard them. There were great gaps where Trollocs had broken
down the stakes with sheer weight of numbers. He rode through one
over a mound of dead Trollocs and never noticed. Dead Trollocs
bristling with arrows carpeted the open ground, and here and there
a pincushioned Fade flailed and thrashed. He saw none of it. He had
eyes for only one thing. Faile.</p>

<p>She started out from the Watch Hill men, pausing to
stop Bain from following, and rode to meet him. She rode so
gracefully, as if the black mare were part of her, slimly erect,
guiding Swallow more with her knees than the reins held so casually
in one hand. The red marriage ribbon still twined through her hair,
the ends dangling past her shoulders. He must find her flowers.</p>

<p>For a moment those tilted eyes studied him, her mouth&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Surely she could not be uncertain, but she smelled it. &ldquo;I
said I would go,&rdquo; she said finally, holding her head high. Swallow
danced sideways, neck arched, and Faile mastered the mare without
seeming to notice &ldquo;I did not say how far. You cannot say I
did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He could not say anything. She was so beautiful. He
just wanted to look at her, to see her, beautiful, alive, with him.
Her scent was clean sweat with just the slightest hint of herbal
soap. He was not sure whether he wanted to laugh or cry. Maybe
both. He wanted to pull all the smell of her into his lungs.</p>

<p>Frowning, she went on. &ldquo;They were ready, Perrin.
Truly, they were. I barely had to say anything to convince them to
come. The Trollocs had hardly bothered them at all, but they could
see the smoke. We traveled hard, Bain and I, and reached Watch Hill
well before first light, and we started back as soon as the sun
rose.&rdquo; Her frown became a wide smile, eager and proud. Such a
beautiful smile. Her dark eyes sparkled. &ldquo;They followed me, Perrin.
They followed me! Even Tenobia has never led men in battle. She
wanted to once, when I was eight, but Father had a talk with her
alone in her chambers, and when he rode off to the Blight she
stayed behind.&rdquo; With a rueful grin, she added, &ldquo;I think you and he
use the same methods sometimes. Tenobia exiled him, but she was
only sixteen, and the Council of Lords managed to change her mind
after a few weeks. She will be blue with envy when I tell her.&rdquo;
Again she paused, this time drawing a deep breath and planting a
fist on her hip. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to say anything?&rdquo; she demanded
impatiently. &ldquo;Are you just going to sit there like a hairy lump? I
did not say I would leave the Two Rivers. You said that, not I.
You&rsquo;ve no right to be angry because I did not do what I never
promised! And you trying to send me away because you thought you
were going to die! I came back to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; It was all he could say, but strangely
it seemed to be enough. No sooner were the words out of his mouth
than she reined Swallow close enough to throw an arm around him and
press her face against his chest; she seemed to be trying to
squeeze him in two. He stroked her dark hair gently, just feeling
the silkiness of it, just feeling her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was so afraid I would be too late,&rdquo; she said into
his coat. &ldquo;The Watch Hill men marched as fast as they could, but
when we arrived, and I saw the Trollocs fighting right in among the
houses, so many of them, as if the village were being buried in an
avalanche, and I couldn&rsquo;t see you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She drew a shivering
breath and let it out slowly. When she spoke again, her voice was
calmer. Just. &ldquo;Did the men from Deven Ride come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave a start, and his hand stopped stroking. &ldquo;Yes,
they did. How did you know? Did you arrange that, too?&rdquo; She began
shaking; it took him a moment to know she was laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my heart, though I would have if I could. When
that man came with his message&mdash;&lsquo;We are coming&rsquo;&mdash;I
thought&mdash;hoped&mdash;that that was what it meant.&rdquo; Pulling
her face back a little, she looked up at him seriously. &ldquo;I could
not tell you, Perrin. I could not raise your hopes when I only
suspected. It would have been too cruel if&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t be angry
with me, Perrin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laughing, he lifted her out of her saddle and set her
sideways in front of his; she laughed her protests, and stretched
across the high pommel to put both arms around him. &ldquo;I will never,
ever be angry with you, I sw&mdash;&rdquo; She cut him off with a hand
over his mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother says the worst thing Father ever did to her
was vow never to be angry with her. It took her a year to force him
to take it back, and she says he was hardly fit to live with long
before then from holding in. You <em>will</em> be angry with me,
Perrin, and I with you. If you want to make me another wedding vow,
vow you will not hide it when you are. I cannot deal with what you
will not let me see, my husband. My husband,&rdquo; she repeated in a
satisfied tone, snuggling against him. &ldquo;I do like the sound of
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He noticed she did not say she would always let him
know when <em>she</em> was angry; on past experience, he would have
to discover it the hard way at least half the time. And she made no
promises not to keep secrets from him again, either. Right then, it
did not matter so long as she was with him. &ldquo;I will let you know
when I&rsquo;m angry, my wife,&rdquo; he promised. She gave him a slanted look,
as if she was not sure how to take that. <em>You won&rsquo;t ever come to
understand them, Cousin Jaim, but you won&rsquo;t care</em>.</p>

<p>Abruptly he became aware of the dead Trollocs all
around him, like a black field full of feathered weeds, the
thrashing Myrddraal still refusing to die finally. Slowly he turned
Stepper. A slaughter yard and a shambles of Shadowspawn stretching
for hundreds of paces in every direction. Crows hopped across the
ground already, and vultures soared overhead in a huge milling
cloud. No ravens, though. And the same to the south, according to
Jaim; he could see the vultures wheeling beyond the village for
proof. Not enough to repay for Deselle or Adora or little Paet or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Not enough; it would never be enough. Nothing could ever
repay for them. He hugged Faile; hard enough to make her grunt, but
when he tried to ease up, she put her hands on his arms, gripping
just as hard to keep them where they were. She was enough.</p>

<p>People were streaming out of Emond&rsquo;s Field, Bran
limping and using his spear for a staff, Marin smiling with an arm
around him, Daise being hugged by her husband, Wit, and Gaul and
Chiad hand in hand with their veils down. Loial&rsquo;s ears drooped
wearily, and Tam had blood on his face, and Flann Lewin was
standing only with the help of his wife, Adine; there was blood on
nearly everyone, and hasty bandages. But they came out in a
widening throng, Elam and Dav, Ewin and Aram, Eward Candwin and
Buel Dowtry, Hu and Tad the stablemen from the Winespring Inn, Ban
and Tell and the Companions riding with that banner still. This
time he did not see the missing faces, only those who were still
there. Verin and Alanna on their horses, with Tomas and Ihvon
riding close behind. Old Bili Congar waving a jug that surely held
ale, or better yet brandy, and Cenn Buie as gnarled as ever if
bruised, and Jac al&rsquo;Seen with an arm around his wife, and his sons
and daughters around him with their wives and husbands. Raen and
Ila, still with the babes on their backs. More. Faces he did not
know at all; men who must be from Deven Ride and the farms down
there. Boys and girls running among them, laughing.</p>

<p>They fanned out to either side, forming a great
hollow circle with the Watch Hill men, Faile and him at its center.
Everyone avoided the dying Fades, but it was as if they did not see
the Shadowspawn lying everywhere, only the pair on Stepper.
Silently they watched, until Perrin began to feel nervous. <em>Why
doesn&rsquo;t somebody say something? Why are they staring like
that?</em></p>

<p>The Whitecloaks appeared, riding slowly out of the
village in their long gleaming column of fours, Dain Bornhald at
their head with Jaret Byar. Every white cloak shone as though
freshly laundered; every lance slanted at precisely the same angle.
Sullen mutters rose, but people moved aside to let them enter the
circle.</p>

<p>Bornhald raised a gauntleted hand, halting the column
in a jingle of bridles and creak of saddles, when he faced Perrin.
&ldquo;It is done, Shadowspawn.&rdquo; Byar&rsquo;s mouth quivered on the brink of a
snarl, but Bornhald&rsquo;s face never changed, his voice never rose.
&ldquo;The Trollocs are done here. As we agreed, I arrest you now for
Darkfriend and murderer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Faile twisted around to stare up at Perrin,
eyes angry. &ldquo;What does he mean, as you <em>agreed</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her words were nearly drowned by the roar from every
side. &ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; and &ldquo;You will not take him!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Goldeneyes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keeping his gaze on Bornhald, Perrin lifted a hand,
and silence descended slowly. When all was quiet, he said, &ldquo;I said
I would not resist, if you aided.&rdquo; Surprising, how calm his voice
was; inside he seethed with a slow, cold anger. &ldquo;If you <em>
aided</em>, Whitecloak. Where were you?&rdquo; The man did not
answer.</p>

<p>Daise Congar stepped out from the encircling throng
with Wit, who clung to her as if he never intended to let go of her
again. For that matter, her stout arm was wrapped around Wit&rsquo;s
shoulders in much the same fashion. They made an odd picture as she
planted her pitchfork-polearm firmly, her the taller by a head and
holding her considerably smaller husband as though she meant to
protect him. &ldquo;They were on the Green,&rdquo; she announced loudly, &ldquo;all
lined up and sitting their horses pretty as girls ready for a dance
at Sunday. They never stirred. It was that that made us come&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;
A fierce murmur of agreement rippled from the women. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;when we
saw you were about to be overrun, and they just sat there like
bumps on a log!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bornhald did not take his eyes from Perrin for an
instant; he did not even blink. &ldquo;Did you think I would trust you?&rdquo;
he sneered. &ldquo;Your plan only failed because these others arrived&mdash;yes?&mdash;and you can claim no part in that.&rdquo; Faile
shifted; without looking away from the man, Perrin laid a finger
across her lips just as she opened her mouth. She bit him&mdash;hard&mdash;but she did not say anything. Bornhald&rsquo;s voice finally
began to rise. &ldquo;I will see you hang, Shadowspawn. I will see you
hang, whatever it takes! I will see you dead if the world burns!&rdquo;
The last came as a shout. Byar&rsquo;s sword slid a hand of bare steel
from its scabbard; a massive Whitecloak behind him&mdash;Farran,
Perrin thought his name was&mdash;drew his completely, with a
pleased smile rather than Byar&rsquo;s toothy snarl.</p>

<p>They froze as quivers rattled to arrows being drawn,
and bows came up all around the circle, fletchings drawn to ear,
every broadhead shaft pointed at a Whitecloak. Up and down the
thick column, high-cantled saddles creaked as men shifted uneasily.
Bornhald showed no sign of fear, and he did not smell of it,
either; his scent was all hate. He ran almost fevered eyes over the
Two Rivers folk encircling his men and returned them to Perrin just
as hot and hate-filled.</p>

<p>Perrin motioned downward, and tension was let off
bowstrings reluctantly, bows lowered slowly. &ldquo;You would not help.&rdquo;
His voice was cold iron, anvil-hard. &ldquo;Since you came to the Two
Rivers, the help you&rsquo;ve given has been almost accidental. You never
really cared if people were burned out, killed, so long as you
could find somebody to call Darkfriend.&rdquo; Bornhald shivered, though
his eyes still burned. &ldquo;It is time for you to go. Not just from
Emond&rsquo;s Field. It is time for you to gather up your Whitecloaks and
leave the Two Rivers. Now, Bornhald. You are going now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>will</em> see you hang one day,&rdquo; Bornhald said
softly. He jerked his hand for the column to follow and booted his
horse forward as if he meant to ride Perrin over.</p>

<p>Perrin moved Stepper aside; he wanted these men gone,
not more killing. Let the man have a final gesture of defiance.</p>

<p>Bornhald never turned his head, but hollow-cheeked
Byar stared silent hate at Perrin, and Farran seemed to look at him
with regret for some reason. The others kept their eyes front as
they passed in a jingle of tack and the clop of hooves. Silently
the circle opened to let them out, heading north.</p>

<p>A knot of ten or twelve men approached Perrin on
foot, some in mismatched bits and pieces of old armor, all grinning
anxiously, as the last of the Whitecloaks went by. He did not
recognize any of them. A wide-nosed, leathery-faced fellow seemed
to be their leader, his white hair bare but a rusty mail shirt
covering him to the knees, though the collar of a farmer&rsquo;s coat
poked up around his neck. He bowed awkwardly over his bow.
&ldquo;Jerinvar Barstere, my Lord Perrin. Jer, they call me.&rdquo; He spoke
hurriedly, as if afraid of being interrupted. &ldquo;Pardon for bothering
you. Some of us will see the Whitecloaks along, if that&rsquo;s all right
with you. A good many want to get on home, even if we can&rsquo;t get
there before dark. There&rsquo;s as many Whitecloaks again in Watch Hill,
but they would not come. Had orders to hold fast, they said. Bunch
of fools, if you ask me, and we&rsquo;re more than tired of having them
around, poking their noses into people&rsquo;s houses and trying to make
you accuse your neighbor of something. We&rsquo;ll see them off, if
that&rsquo;s all right with you.&rdquo; He gave Faile an abashed look, ducking
his broad chin, but the flow of words did not slow. &ldquo;Pardon, my
Lady Faile. Didn&rsquo;t mean to bother you and your lord. Just wanted to
let him know we&rsquo;re with him. A fine woman you have there, my Lord.
A fine woman. No offense meant, my Lady. Well, we&rsquo;ve daylight
still, and talk shears no sheep. Pardon for bothering you, my Lord
Perrin. Pardon, my Lady Faile.&rdquo; He bowed again, imitated by the
others, and they hurried away with him herding them, muttering at
them, &ldquo;No time for us to be bothering the lord and his lady.
There&rsquo;s work to do yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was that?&rdquo; Perrin said, a trifle stunned by the
torrent; Daise and Cenn together could not talk that much. &ldquo;Do you
know him, Faile? From Watch Hill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Barstere is the Mayor of Watch Hill, and the
others are the Village Council. The Watch Hill Women&rsquo;s Circle will
be sending a delegation down under their Wisdom once they&rsquo;re
certain it is safe. To see if &lsquo;this Lord Perrin&rsquo; is right for the
Two Rivers, they say, but they all wanted me to show them how to
curtsy to you, and the Wisdom, Edelle Gaelin, is bringing you some
of her dried-apple tarts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, burn me!&rdquo; he breathed. It was spreading. He knew
he should have stamped it down hard in the beginning. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call
me that!&rdquo; he shouted after the departing men. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a blacksmith! Do
you hear me? A blacksmith!&rdquo; Jer Barstere turned to wave at him and
nod before hurrying the others on.</p>

<p>Chortling, Faile tugged at his beard. &ldquo;You are a
sweet fool, my Lord Blacksmith. It is too late to turn back now.&rdquo;
Suddenly her smile became truly wicked. &ldquo;Husband, is there any
possibility you might be alone with your wife any time soon?
Marriage seems to have made me as bold as a Domani gall! I know you
must be tired, but&mdash;&rdquo; She cut off with a small shriek and
clung to his coat as he booted Stepper to a gallop toward the
Winespring Inn. For once the cheers that followed did not bother
him at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goldeneyes! Lord Perrin! Goldeneyes!&rdquo;</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">From the thick branch of a leafy oak on the edge of
the Westwood, Ordeith stared at Emond&rsquo;s Field, a mile to the
south. It was impossible. <em>Scourge them. Flay them</em>.
Everything had been going according to plan. Even Isam had played
into his hands. <em>Why did the fool stop bringing Trollocs? He
should have brought in enough to turn the Two Rivers black with
them!</em> Spittle dripped from his lips, but he did not notice,
any more than he realized that his hand was fumbling at his belt.
<em>Harry them till their hearts burst! Harrow them into the ground
screaming!</em> All planned to pull Rand al&rsquo;Thor to him, and it
came to this! The Two Rivers had not even been scratched. A few
farms burned did not count, nor a few farmers butchered alive for
Trolloc cookpots. <em>I</em> <em>want the Two Rivers to</em> burn,
<em>burn so the fire lives in men&rsquo;s memories for a thousand
years!</em></p>

<p>He studied the banner waving over the village, and
the one not that far below him. A scarlet wolfhead on
scarlet-bordered white, and a red eagle. Red for the blood the Two
Rivers must shed to make Rand al&rsquo;Thor howl. Manetheren. <em>That&rsquo;s
meant to be Manetheren&rsquo;s banner</em>. Someone had told them of
Manetheren, had they? What did these fools know of the glories of
Manetheren? <em>Manetheren. Yes</em>. There was more than one way
to scourge them. He laughed so hard he nearly fell out of the oak
before he realized that he was not holding on with both hands, that
one gripped his belt where a dagger should have hung. The laugh
twisted into a snarl as he stared at that hand. The White Tower
held what had been stolen from him. What was his by right as old as
the Trolloc Wars.</p>

<p>He let himself drop to the ground, and scrambled onto
his horse before looking at his companions. His hounds. The thirty
or so Whitecloaks remaining no longer wore their white cloaks, of
course. Rust spotted their dull plate-and-mail, and Bornhald would
never have recognized those sullen, suspicious faces, dirty and
unshaven. The humans watched Ordeith, distrustful yet afraid, not
even glancing at the Myrddraal in their midst, its slug-pale,
eyeless face as bleakly wooden as theirs. The Halfman feared Isam
would find it; Isam had not at all been pleased when that raid on
Taren Ferry let so many escape to carry away word of what was
happening in the Two Rivers. Ordeith giggled at the thought of Isam
discomforted. The man was a problem for another time, if he still
lived.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We ride for Tar Valon,&rdquo; he snapped. Hard riding, to
beat Bornhald to the ferry. Manetheren&rsquo;s banner, raised again in
the Two Rivers after all these centuries. How the Red Eagle had
harried him, so long ago. &ldquo;But Caemlyn first!&rdquo; <em>Scourge them and
flay them!</em> Let the Two Rivers pay first, and then Rand
al&rsquo;Thor, and then&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Laughing, he galloped north through the forest, not
looking back to see if the others followed. They would. They had
nowhere else to go now.</p>
