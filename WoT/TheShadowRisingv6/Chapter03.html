<h4><em>Reflection</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">D</span>espite
the hour, a good many people were hurrying
through the Stone&rsquo;s wide corridors, a steady trickle of men and
women in the black and gold of Stone servants or the livery of one
High Lord or another. Now and again a Defender or two appeared,
bareheaded and unarmed, some with their coats undone. The servants
bowed or curtsied to Perrin and Faile if they came close, then
hurried on with hardly a pause. Most of the soldiers gave a start
on seeing them. Some bowed stiffly, hand to heart, but one and all
quickened their steps as if eager to be away.</p>

<p>Only one lamp in three or four was lit. In the dim
stretches between their tall stands, shadows blurred the hanging
tapestries and obscured the occasional chest against the wall. For
any eyes but Perrin&rsquo;s, they did. His eyes glowed like burnished
gold in those murky lengths of hall. He walked quickly from lamp to
lamp and kept his gaze down unless he was in full light. Most
people in the Stone knew about his strangely colored eyes, one way
or another. None of them mentioned it, of course. Even Faile seemed
to assume the color was part of his association with an Aes Sedai,
something that simply was, to be accepted but never explained. Even
so, a prickling always ran across his back whenever he realized
that a stranger had seen his eyes shining in the dark. When they
held their tongues, the silence only emphasized his apartness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish they wouldn&rsquo;t look at me like that,&rdquo; he
muttered as a grizzled Defender twice his age came close to running
once he had passed. &ldquo;As though they are afraid of me. They haven&rsquo;t
before; not this way. Why aren&rsquo;t all these people in bed?&rdquo; A woman
carrying a mop and a bucket bobbed a curtsy and scurried by with
her head down.</p>

<p>Her arm twined through his, Faile glanced at him. &ldquo;I
would say the guards are not supposed to be in this part of the
Stone unless they are on duty. A good time to cuddle a maid on a
lord&rsquo;s chair, and maybe pretend they are the lord and lady, while
lord and lady are asleep. They are probably worried that you might
report them. And servants do most of their work at night. Who would
want them underfoot, sweeping and dusting and polishing, in
daylight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin nodded doubtfully. He supposed she would know
about such things from her father&rsquo;s house. A successful merchant
likely had servants, and guards for his wagons. At least these folk
were not out of their beds because what had happened to him had
happened to them, too. If that were the case, they would be out of
the Stone altogether, and likely still running. But why had he been
a target, singled out, as it seemed? He was not looking forward to
confronting Rand, but he had to know. Faile had to stretch her
stride to keep up with him.</p>

<p>For all its splendor, all the gold and fine carving
and inlays, the interior of the Stone had been designed for war as
much as its exterior had been. Murderholes dotted the ceiling
wherever corridors crossed. Never used arrowslits peeked into the
halls at places where they might cover an entire hallway. He and
Faile climbed narrow, curving staircase after narrow, curving
staircase, all built into the walls or else enclosed, with more
arrowslits looking down on the corridor below. None of this design
had hampered the Aiel, of course, the first enemy ever to get
beyond the outer wall.</p>

<p>As they trotted up one of the winding stairs&mdash;Perrin did not realize they were trotting, though he would have
been moving faster if not for Faile on his arm&mdash;he caught a
whiff of old sweat and a hint of sickly-sweet perfume, but they
registered only in the back of his brain. He was caught up in what
he was going to say to Rand. <em>Why did you try to kill me? Are
you going mad already?</em> There was no easy way to ask, and he
did not expect easy answers.</p>

<p>Stepping out into a shadowed corridor nearly at the
top of the Stone, he found himself staring at the backs of a High
Lord and two of the nobleman&rsquo;s personal guards. Only the Defenders
were allowed to wear armor inside the Stone, but these three had
swords at their hips. That was not unusual, of course, but their
presence here, on this floor, in the shadows, staring intently at
the bright light at the far end of the hall, that was not usual at
all. That light came from the anteroom in front of the chambers
Rand had been given. Or taken. Or maybe been pushed into by
Moiraine.</p>

<p>Perrin and Faile had made no effort to be quiet in
climbing the stairs, but the three men were so intent in their
watching that none of them noticed the new arrivals at first. Then
one of the blue-coated bodyguards twisted his head as if working a
cramp in his neck; his mouth dropped open when he saw them. Biting
off an oath, the fellow whirled to face Perrin, baring a good hand
of his sword blade. The other was only a heartbeat slower. Both
stood tensed, ready, but their eyes shifted uneasily, sliding off
Perrin&rsquo;s. They gave off a sour smell of fear. So did the High Lord,
though he had his fear tightly reined.</p>

<p>The High Lord Torean, white streaking his dark,
pointed beard, moved languidly, as if at a ball. Pulling a too
sweetly scented handkerchief from his sleeve, he dabbed at a knobby
nose that appeared not at all large when compared with his ears. A
fine silk coat with red satin cuffs only exaggerated the plainness
of his face. He eyed Perrin&rsquo;s shirtsleeves and dabbed his nose
again before inclining his head slightly. &ldquo;The Light illumine you,&rdquo;
he said politely. His glance touched Perrin&rsquo;s yellow stare and
flinched away, though his expression did not change. &ldquo;You are well,
I trust?&rdquo; Perhaps too politely.</p>

<p>Perrin did not really care for the man&rsquo;s tone, but
the way Torean looked Faile up and down, with a sort of casual
interest, clenched his fists. He managed to keep his voice level,
though. &ldquo;The Light illumine you, High Lord Torean. I am glad to see
you helping keep watch over the Lord Dragon. Some men in your place
might resent him being here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Torean&rsquo;s thin eyebrows twitched. &ldquo;Prophecy has been
fulfilled, and Tear has fulfilled its place in that prophecy.
Perhaps the Dragon Reborn will lead Tear to a still greater
destiny. What man could resent that? But it is late. A good night
to you.&rdquo; He eyed Faile again, pursing his lips, and walked off down
the hall just a bit too briskly, away from the anteroom&rsquo;s lights.
His bodyguards heeled him like well-trained dogs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was no need for you to be uncivil,&rdquo; Faile said
in a tight voice when the High Lord was out of hearing. &ldquo;You
sounded as if your tongue were frozen iron. If you do intend to
remain here, you had better learn to get on with the lords.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was looking at you as if he wanted to dandle you
on his knee. And I do not mean like a father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sniffed dismissively. &ldquo;He is not the first man
ever to look at me. If he found the nerve to try more, I could put
him in his place with a frown and a glance. I do not need you to
speak for me, Perrin Aybara.&rdquo; Still, she did not sound entirely
displeased.</p>

<p>Scratching his beard, he peered after Torean,
watching the High Lord and his guards vanish around a distant
corner. He wondered how the Taken lords managed without sweating to
death. &ldquo;Did you notice, Faile? His heel-hounds did not take their
hands off their swords until he was ten paces clear of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She frowned at him, then down the hall after the
three, and nodded slowly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. But I do not understand.
They do not bow and scrape the way they do for <em>him</em>, but
everyone walks as warily around you and Mat as they do around the
Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe being a friend of the Dragon Reborn isn&rsquo;t as
much protection as it used to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not suggest leaving again, not in words, but
her eyes were full of it. He was more successful in ignoring the
unspoken suggestion than he had been with the spoken.</p>

<p>Before they reached the end of the hallway, Berelain
came hurrying out of the bright lights of the anteroom, clutching a
thin white robe tightly around her with both arms. If the First of
Mayene had been walking any faster, she would have been
running.</p>

<p>To show Faile he could be as civil as she could
possibly wish, Perrin swept a bow that he wagered even Mat could
not have bettered. By contrast, Faile&rsquo;s curtsy was the barest nod
of her head, the merest bending of a knee. He hardly noticed. As
Berelain rushed past them without a glance, the smell of fear, rank
and raw as a festering wound, made his nostrils twitch. Beside
this, Torean&rsquo;s fear was nothing. This was mad panic tied with a
frayed rope. He straightened slowly, staring after her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Filling your eyes?&rdquo; Faile asked softly.</p>

<p>Intent on Berelain, wondering what had driven her so
near the brink, he spoke without thinking. &ldquo;She smelled of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Far down the corridor, Torean suddenly stepped out of
a side hallway to seize Berelain&rsquo;s arm. He was talking a torrent,
but Perrin could not make out more than a handful of scattered
words, something about her overstepping herself in her pride, and
something else that seemed to be Torean offering her his
protection. Her reply was short, sharp, and even more inaudible,
delivered with lifted chin. Pulling herself free roughly, the First
of Mayene walked away, back straight and seemingly more in command
of herself. On the point of following, Torean saw Perrin watching.
Dabbing at his nose with his handkerchief, the High Lord vanished
back into the crossing corridor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not care if she smelled of the Essence of
Dawn,&rdquo; Faile said darkly. &ldquo;That one is not interested in hunting a
bear, however fine his hide would look stretched on a wall. She
hunts the sun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He frowned at her. &ldquo;The sun? A bear? What are you
talking about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go on by yourself. I think I will go to my bed
after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s what you want,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;but I
thought you were as eager to find out what happened as I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not. I&rsquo;ll not pretend I am eager to meet the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Rand&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;not after avoiding it until now. And now I am
especially not eager. No doubt the two of you will have a fine talk
without me. Especially if there&rsquo;s wine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t make any sense,&rdquo; he muttered, scrubbing a
hand through his hair. &ldquo;If you want to go to bed, then fine, but I
wish you would say something I understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a long moment she studied his face, then suddenly
bit her lip. He thought she was trying not to laugh. &ldquo;Oh, Perrin,
sometimes I believe it is your innocence I enjoy most of all.&rdquo; Sure
enough, traces of laughter silvered her voice. &ldquo;You go on to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to your friend and tell me of it in the morning. As much as you
want to.&rdquo; She pulled his head down to brush his lips with a kiss
and, as quick as the kiss, ran back down the hallway.</p>

<p>Shaking his head, he watched until she turned in to
the stairs with no sign of Torean. Sometimes it was as if she spoke
another language. He headed toward the lights.</p>

<p>The anteroom was a round chamber fifty paces or more
across. A hundred gilded lamps hung on golden chains from its high
ceiling. Polished redstone columns made an inner ring, and the
floor appeared to be one huge slab of black marble, streaked with
gold. It had been the anteroom of the king&rsquo;s chambers, in the days
when Tear had kings, before Artur Hawkwing put everything from the
Spine of the World to the Aryth Ocean under one king. The Tairen
kings had not returned when Hawkwing&rsquo;s empire collapsed, and for a
thousand years the only inhabitants of these apartments had been
mice tracking through dust. No High Lord had ever had enough power
to dare claim them for his own.</p>

<p>A ring of fifty Defenders stood rigidly in the middle
of the room, breastplates and rimmed helmets gleaming, spears all
slanted at exactly the same angle. Facing every direction as they
did, they were supposed to keep all intruders from the current lord
of the Stone. Their commander, a captain distinguished by two short
white plumes on his helmet, held himself only a trifle less
stiffly. He posed with one hand on his sword hilt and the other on
his hip, self-important with his duty. They all smelled of fear and
uncertainty, like men who lived under a crumbling cliff and had
almost managed to convince themselves it would never fall. Or at
least not tonight. Not in the next hour.</p>

<p>Perrin walked on by them, his bootheels making
echoes. The officer started toward him, then hesitated when Perrin
did not stop to be challenged. He knew who Perrin was, of course;
at least, he knew as much as any Tairen knew. Traveling companion
of Aes Sedai, friend of the Lord Dragon. Not a man to be interfered
with by a mere officer of the Defenders of the Stone. There was his
apparent task of guarding the Lord Dragon&rsquo;s rest, of course, but
though he probably did not admit it even to himself, the officer
had to know that he and his brave show of polished armor were
simply that. The real guards were those Perrin met when he strode
beyond the columns and approached the doors to Rand&rsquo;s chambers.</p>

<p>They had been sitting so still behind the columns
that they seemed to fade into the stone, though their coats and
breeches&mdash;in shades of gray and brown, made to hide them in
the Waste&mdash;stood out here as soon as they moved. Six Maidens
of the Spear, Aiel women who had chosen a warrior&rsquo;s life over the
hearth, flowed between him and the doors on soft, laced boots that
reached their knees. They were tall for women, the tallest barely a
hand shorter than he, sun-darkened, with short-cropped hair, yellow
or red or something in between. Two held curved horn bows with
arrows nocked, if not drawn. The others carried small hide bucklers
and three or four short spears each&mdash;short, but with
spearheads long enough to stick through a man&rsquo;s body with inches to
spare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think I can let you go in,&rdquo; a woman with
flame-colored hair said, smiling slightly to take the sting out of
the words. Aiel did not go about grinning as much as other folk, or
show a great deal of any outward emotion for that matter. &ldquo;I think
he does not want to see anyone tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going in, Bain.&rdquo; Ignoring her spears, he took
her by the upper arms. That was when it became impossible to ignore
the spears, since she had managed to get a spearpoint hard against
the side of his throat. For that matter, a somewhat blonder woman
named Chiad suddenly had one of her spears at the other side, as if
the two were intended to meet somewhere in the middle of his neck.
The other women only watched, confident that Bain and Chiad could
handle whatever had to be done. Still, he did his best. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
have time to argue with you. Not that you listen to people who
argue with you, as I remember. I am going in.&rdquo; As gently as he
could, he picked Bain up and set her out of his way.</p>

<p>Chiad&rsquo;s spear only needed her to breathe on it to
draw blood, but after one startled widening of dark blue eyes, Bain
abruptly took hers away and grinned. &ldquo;Would you like to learn a
game called Maidens&rsquo; Kiss, Perrin? You might play well, I think. At
the very least you would learn something.&rdquo; One of the others
laughed aloud. Chiad&rsquo;s spearpoint left his neck.</p>

<p>He took a deep breath, hoping they would not notice
it was his first since the spears touched him. They had not veiled
their faces&mdash;their <em>shoufa</em> lay coiled around their
necks like dark scarves&mdash;but he did not know if Aiel had to
do so before they killed, only that veiling meant they were ready
to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another time, perhaps,&rdquo; he said politely. They were
all grinning as if Bain had said something amusing, and his not
understanding was part of the humor. Thom was right. A man could go
crazy trying to understand women, of any nation and any station in
life; that was what Thom said.</p>

<p>As he reached for a door handle in the shape of a
rearing golden lion, Bain added, &ldquo;On your head be it. He has
already chased out what most men would consider better company by
far than you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Of course</em>, he thought, pulling open the
door, <em>Berelain. She was coming from here. Tonight, everything
is revolving around</em>&mdash;</p>

<p>The First of Mayene vanished from his thoughts as he
got a look into the room. Broken mirrors hung on the walls and
broken glass covered the floor, along with shards of shattered
porcelain and feathers from the slashed mattress. Open books lay
tumbled among overturned chairs and benches. And Rand was sitting
at the foot of his bed, slumped against one of the bedposts with
eyes closed and hands limp atop <em>Callandor</em>, which lay
across his knees. He looked as if he had taken a bath in blood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get Moiraine!&rdquo; Perrin snapped at the Aiel women. Was
Rand still alive? If he was, he needed Aes Sedai Healing to stay
that way. &ldquo;Tell her to hurry!&rdquo; He heard a gasp behind him, then
soft boots running.</p>

<p>Rand lifted his head. His face was a smeared mask.
&ldquo;Shut the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moiraine will be here soon, Rand. Rest easy. She
will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut the door, Perrin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Murmuring among themselves, the Aiel women frowned,
but moved back. Perrin pulled the door to, cutting off a
questioning shout from the white-plumed officer.</p>

<p>Glass crunched under his boots as he crossed the
carpet to Rand. Tearing a strip from a wildly sliced linen sheet,
he wadded it against the wound in Rand&rsquo;s side. Rand&rsquo;s hands
tightened on the transparent sword at the pressure, then relaxed.
Blood soaked through almost immediately. Cuts and gashes covered
him from the soles of his feet to his head; slivers of glass
glittered in many of them. Perrin rolled his shoulders helplessly.
He did not know what more to do, other than wait for Moiraine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What under the Light did you try to do, Rand? You
look as though you tried to skin yourself. And you nearly killed
me, as well.&rdquo; For a moment he thought Rand was not going to
answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not me,&rdquo; Rand said finally, in a near whisper. &ldquo;One
of the Forsaken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin tried to relax muscles he did not remember
tensing. The effort was only partly successful. He had mentioned
the Forsaken to Faile, not exactly casually, but by and large he
had been trying not to think of what the Forsaken might do when
they found out where Rand was. If one of them could bring down the
Dragon Reborn, he or she would stand high above the others when the
Dark One broke free. The Dark One free, and the Last Battle lost
before it was fought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; he said, just as quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It had to be, Perrin. It had to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If one of them came after me as well as you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?
Where&rsquo;s Mat, Rand? If he was alive, and went through what I did,
he&rsquo;d be thinking what I did. That it was you. He&rsquo;d be here by now
to bless you out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or on a horse and halfway to the city gates.&rdquo; Rand
struggled to sit erect. Drying blood smears cracked, and fresh
trickles started on his chest and shoulders. &ldquo;If he is dead,
Perrin, you had best get as far from me as you can. I think you and
Loial are right about that.&rdquo; He paused, studying Perrin. &ldquo;You and
Mat must wish I had never been born. Or at least that you&rsquo;d never
seen me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no point in going to check; if anything had
happened to Mat, it was over and done now. And he had a feeling
that his makeshift bandage pressed against Rand&rsquo;s side might be
what would keep him alive long enough for Moiraine to get there.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to care if he <em>has</em> gone off. Burn me, he&rsquo;s
important, too. What are you going to do if he&rsquo;s gone? Or dead, the
Light send it not so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What they least expect.&rdquo; Rand&rsquo;s eyes looked like
morning mist covering the dawn, blue-gray with a feverish glow
seeping through. His voice had a knife edge. &ldquo;That is what I have
to do in any case. What <em>everyone</em> least expects.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin took a slow breath. Rand had a right to taut
nerves. It was not a sign of incipient madness. He had to stop
watching for signs of madness. Those signs would come soon enough,
and watching would do nothing but keep his stomach tied in knots.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he asked quietly.</p>

<p>Rand closed his eyes. &ldquo;I only know I have to catch
them by surprise. Catch everyone by surprise,&rdquo; he muttered
fiercely.</p>

<p>One of the doors opened to admit a tall Aielman, his
dark red hair touched with gray. Behind him the Tairen officer&rsquo;s
plumes bobbed as he argued with the Maidens; he was still arguing
when Bain pushed the door shut.</p>

<p>Rhuarc surveyed the room with sharp blue eyes, as if
he suspected enemies hiding behind a drape or an overturned chair.
The clan chief of the Taardad Aiel had no visible weapon except the
heavy-bladed knife at his waist, but he carried authority and
confidence like weapons, quietly, yet as surely as if they were
sheathed alongside the knife. And his <em>shoufa</em> hung about
his shoulders; no one who knew the slightest about Aiel took one
for less than dangerous when he wore the means to veil his
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That Tairen fool outside sent word to his commander
that something had happened in here,&rdquo; Rhuarc said, &ldquo;and rumors are
already sprouting like corpse moss in a deep cave. Everything from
the White Tower trying to kill you to the Last Battle fought here
in this room.&rdquo; Perrin opened his mouth; Rhuarc raised a
forestalling hand. &ldquo;I happened to meet Berelain, looking as if she
had been told the day she would die, and she told me the truth of
it. And it does look to be the truth, though I doubted her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sent for Moiraine,&rdquo; Perrin said. Rhuarc nodded. Of
course, the Maidens would have told him everything they knew.</p>

<p>Rand gave a painful bark of a laugh. &ldquo;I told her to
keep quiet. It seems the Lord Dragon doesn&rsquo;t rule Mayene.&rdquo; He
sounded more wryly amused than anything else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have daughters older than that young woman,&rdquo;
Rhuarc said. &ldquo;I do not believe she will tell anyone else. I think
she would like to forget everything that happened tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I would like to know what happened,&rdquo; Moiraine
said, gliding into the room. Slight and slender as she was, Rhuarc
towered over her as much as the man who followed her in&mdash;Lan,
her Warder&mdash;but it was the Aes Sedai who dominated the room.
She must have run to come so fast, but she was calm as a frozen
lake now. It took a great deal to ruffle Moiraine&rsquo;s serenity. Her
blue silk gown had a high lace neck and sleeves slashed with darker
velvet, but the heat and humidity did not appear to touch her. A
small blue stone, suspended on her forehead from a fine golden
chain in her dark hair, flashed in the light, emphasizing the
absence of the slightest sheen of sweat.</p>

<p>As always when they met, Lan&rsquo;s and Rhuarc&rsquo;s icy blue
stares nearly struck sparks. A braided leather cord held Lan&rsquo;s dark
hair, gray-streaked at the temples. His face looked to have been
carved from rock, all hard planes and angles, and his sword rode
his hip like part of his body. Perrin was not sure which of the two
men was more deadly, but he thought a mouse could starve on the
difference.</p>

<p>The Warder&rsquo;s eyes swung to Rand. &ldquo;I thought you were
old enough to shave without someone to guide your hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rhuarc smiled, a slight smile but the first Perrin
had ever seen from him in Lan&rsquo;s presence. &ldquo;He is young yet. He will
learn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan glanced back at the Aielman, then returned the
smile, just as slightly.</p>

<p>Moiraine gave the two men a brief, withering look.
She did not seem to pick her way as she crossed the carpet, but she
stepped so lightly, holding her skirts up, that not one shard of
glass crunched under her slippers. Her eyes swept around the room;
taking in the smallest details, Perrin was sure. For a moment she
studied him&mdash;he did not meet her gaze; she knew too much
about him for comfort&mdash;but she bore down on Rand like a
silent, silken avalanche, icy and inexorable.</p>

<p>Perrin dropped his hand and moved out of her way. The
wadded cloth stayed against Rand&rsquo;s side, held by congealing blood.
From head to foot the blood was beginning to dry in black streaks
and smears. The slivers of glass in his skin glittered in the
lamplight. Moiraine touched the blood-caked cloth with her
fingertips, then took her hand back as though changing her mind
about looking underneath. Perrin wondered how the Aes Sedai could
look at Rand without wincing, but her smooth face did not change.
She smelled faintly of rose-scented soap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least you are alive.&rdquo; Her voice was musical, a
chill, angry music at the moment. &ldquo;What happened can wait. Try to
touch the True Source.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Rand asked in a wary voice. &ldquo;I cannot Heal
myself, even if I knew how to Heal. No one can. I know that
much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the space of a breath Moiraine seemed on the
point of an outburst, strange as that would have been, but in
another breath she was once again layered in calm so deep that
surely nothing could crack it. &ldquo;Only some of the strength for
Healing comes from the Healer. The Power can replace what comes
from the Healed. Without it, you will spend tomorrow flat on your
back and perhaps the next day as well. Now, draw on the Power, if
you can, but do nothing with it. Simply hold it. Use this, if you
must.&rdquo; She did not have to bend far to touch <em>
Callandor</em>.</p>

<p>Rand moved the sword from under her hand. &ldquo;Simply
hold it, you say.&rdquo; He sounded about to laugh out loud. &ldquo;Very
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nothing happened that Perrin could see, not that he
expected to. Rand sat there like the survivor of a lost battle,
looking at Moiraine. She hardly blinked. Twice she scrubbed her
fingers against her palms as if unaware.</p>

<p>After a time Rand sighed. &ldquo;I cannot even reach the
Void. I can&rsquo;t seem to concentrate.&rdquo; A quick grin cracked the blood
drying on his face. &ldquo;I do not understand why.&rdquo; A thick red thread
snaked its way down past his left eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I will do it as I always have,&rdquo; Moiraine said,
and took Rand&rsquo;s head in her hands, careless of the blood that ran
over her fingers.</p>

<p>Rand lurched to his feet with a roaring gasp, as if
all the breath were being squeezed from his lungs, back arching so
his head nearly tore free of her grasp. One arm flung wide, fingers
spread and bending back so far it seemed they must break; the other
hand clamped down on <em>Callandor</em>&rsquo;s hilt, the muscles of that
arm knotting visibly into cramps. He shook like cloth caught in a
windstorm. Dark flakes of dried blood fell, and bits of glass
tinkled onto the chest and floor, forced out of cuts closing up and
knitting themselves together.</p>

<p>Perrin shivered as if that windstorm roared around
him. He had seen Healing done before, that and more, greater and
worse, but he could never be complacent about seeing the Power
used, about knowing it was being used, not even for this. Tales of
Aes Sedai, told by merchants&rsquo; guards and drivers, had embedded
themselves in his mind long years before he met Moiraine. Rhuarc
smelled sharply uneasy. Only Lan took it as a matter of course. Lan
and Moiraine.</p>

<p>Almost as soon as it began, it was done. Moiraine
took her hands away, and Rand slumped, catching the bedpost to hold
himself on his feet. It was difficult to say whether he clutched
the bedpost or <em>Callandor</em> more tenaciously. When Moiraine
tried to take the sword to replace it on the ornate stand against
the wall, he drew it away from her firmly, even roughly.</p>

<p>Her mouth tightened momentarily, but she contented
herself with pulling the wad of cloth from his side, using it to
scrub away some of the surrounding smears. The old wound was a
tender scar again. The other injuries were simply gone. The mostly
dried blood that still covered him could have come from someone
else.</p>

<p>Moiraine frowned. &ldquo;It still does not respond,&rdquo; she
murmured, half to herself. &ldquo;It will not heal completely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the one that will kill me, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he
asked her softly, then quoted, &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;His blood on the rocks of Shayol
Ghul, washing away the Shadow, sacrifice for man&rsquo;s salvation.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You read too much,&rdquo; she said sharply, &ldquo;and
understand too little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you understand more? If you do, then tell
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is only trying to find his way,&rdquo; Lan said
suddenly. &ldquo;No man likes to run forward blindly when he knows there
is a cliff somewhere ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin gave a twitch of surprise. Lan almost never
disagreed with Moiraine, or at least not where anyone could
overhear. He and Rand had been spending a good deal of time
together, though, practicing the sword.</p>

<p>Moiraine&rsquo;s dark eyes flashed, but what she said was
&ldquo;He needs to be in bed. Will you ask that wash water be brought,
and another bedchamber prepared? This one needs a thorough cleaning
and a new mattress.&rdquo; Lan nodded and put his head into the anteroom
for a moment, speaking quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will sleep here, Moiraine.&rdquo; Letting go of the
bedpost, Rand pushed himself erect, grounding <em>Callandor</em>&rsquo;s
point on the littered carpet and resting both hands on the hilt. If
he leaned a little on the sword, it did not show much. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be
chased any more. Not even out of a bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Tai&rsquo;shar Manetheren</em>,&rdquo; Lan
murmured.</p>

<p>This time even Rhuarc looked startled, but if
Moiraine heard the Warder compliment Rand, she gave no sign of it.
She was staring at Rand, her face smooth but thunderheads in her
eyes. Rand wore a quizzical little smile, as if wondering what she
would try next.</p>

<p>Perrin edged toward the doors. If Rand and the Aes
Sedai were going to match wills, he would just as soon be
elsewhere. Lan did not appear to care; it was hard to tell with
that stance of his, somehow standing with his back straight and
slouching at the same time. He could have been bored enough to
sleep where he stood or ready to draw his sword; his manner
suggested either, or both. Rhuarc stood much the same, but he was
eyeing the doors, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay where you are!&rdquo; Moiraine did not look away from
Rand, and her outflung finger pointed halfway between Perrin and
Rhuarc, but Perrin&rsquo;s feet stopped just the same. Rhuarc shrugged
and folded his arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stubborn,&rdquo; Moiraine muttered. This time the word was
for Rand. &ldquo;Very well. If you mean to stand there until you drop,
you can use the time before you fall on your face to tell me what
occurred here. I cannot teach you, but if you tell me perhaps I can
see what you did wrong. A small chance, but perhaps I can.&rdquo; Her
voice sharpened. &ldquo;You must learn to control it, and I do not mean
just because of things like this. If you do not learn to control
the Power, it will kill you. You know that. I have told you often
enough. You must teach yourself. You must find it within
yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did nothing except survive,&rdquo; he said in a dry
voice: She opened her mouth, but he went on. &ldquo;Do you think I could
channel and not know it? I didn&rsquo;t do it in my sleep. This happened
awake.&rdquo; He wavered, and caught himself on the sword.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even you could not channel anything but Spirit
asleep,&rdquo; Moiraine said coolly, &ldquo;and this was never done with
Spirit. I was about to ask what <em>did</em> happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin felt his hackles rising as Rand told his
story; The axe had been bad enough, but at least the axe was
something solid, something real. To have your own reflection jump
out of mirrors at you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Unconsciously he shifted his feet,
trying not to stand on any fragments of glass.</p>

<p>Soon after he began speaking, Rand glanced behind him
at the chest, a quick look, as if he did not want it observed.
After a moment the slivers of silvered glass that were scattered
across the lid of the chest stirred and slid off onto the carpet as
though pushed by an unseen broom. Rand exchanged looks with
Moiraine, then sat down slowly and went on. Perrin was not sure
which of them had cleared the chest top. There was no mention of
Berelain in the tale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must have been one of the Forsaken,&rdquo; Rand
finished at last. &ldquo;Maybe Sammael. You said he&rsquo;s in Illian. Unless
one of them is here in Tear. Could Sammael reach the Stone from
Illian?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not even if <em>he</em> held <em>Callandor,</em>&rdquo;
Moiraine told him. &ldquo;There are limits. Sammael is only a man, not
the Dark One.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Only a man? Not a very good description, Perrin
thought. A man who could channel, but who somehow had not gone mad;
at least, not yet, not that anyone knew. A man perhaps as strong as
Rand, but where Rand was trying to learn, Sammael knew every trick
of his talents already. A man who had spent three thousand years
trapped in the Dark One&rsquo;s prison, a man who had gone over to the
Shadow of his own choice. No. &ldquo;Only a man&rdquo; did not begin to
describe Sammael, or any of the Forsaken, male or female.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then one of them is here. In the city.&rdquo; Rand put his
head down on his wrists, but jerked himself erect immediately,
glaring at those in the room. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not be chased again. I&rsquo;ll be
the hound, first, I will find him&mdash;or her&mdash;and I will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not one of the Forsaken,&rdquo; Moiraine cut in. &ldquo;I think
not. This was too simple. And too complex.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand spoke calmly. &ldquo;No riddles, Moiraine. If not the
Forsaken, who? Or what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai&rsquo;s face could have done for an anvil,
yet she hesitated, feeling her way. There was no telling whether
she was unsure of the answer or deciding how much to reveal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the seals holding the Dark One&rsquo;s prison weaken,&rdquo;
she said after a time, &ldquo;it may be inevitable that a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;miasma .
. . will escape even while he is still held. Like bubbles rising
from the things rotting on the bottom of a pond. But these bubbles
will drift through the Pattern until they attach to a thread and
burst.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light!&rdquo; It slipped out before Perrin could stop it.
Moiraine&rsquo;s eyes turned to him. &ldquo;You mean what happened to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to
Rand is going to start happening to everybody?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not to everyone. Not yet, at least. In the beginning
I think there will only be a few bubbles, slipping through cracks
the Dark One can reach through. Later, who can say? And just as
<em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> bend the other threads in the Pattern around
them, I think perhaps <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> will tend to attract these
bubbles more powerfully than others do.&rdquo; Her eyes said she knew
Rand was not the only one to have had a waking nightmare. A brief
touch of a smile, there and gone almost before he saw it, said he
could keep silent if he wished to hold it secret from others. But
she knew. &ldquo;Yet in the months to come&mdash;the years, should we be
lucky enough to have that long&mdash;I fear a good many people
will see things to give them white hairs, if they survive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;Do you know if he&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Is he&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will know soon enough,&rdquo; Moiraine replied
calmly. &ldquo;What is done cannot be undone, but we can hope.&rdquo;
Whatever her tone, though, she smelled ill at ease until Rhuarc
spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is well. Or was. I saw him on my way here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going where?&rdquo; Moiraine said with an edge in her
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He looked to be heading for the servants&rsquo; quarters,&rdquo;
the Aielman told her. He knew that the three were <em>
ta&rsquo;veren</em>, if not as much else as he thought he did, and he
knew Mat well enough to add, &ldquo;Not the stables, Aes Sedai. The other
way, toward the river. And there are no boats at the Stone&rsquo;s
docks.&rdquo; He did not stumble over words like &ldquo;boat&rdquo; and &ldquo;dock&rdquo; the
way most of the Aiel did, although in the Waste such things existed
only in stories.</p>

<p>She nodded as if she had expected nothing else.
Perrin shook his head; she was so used to hiding her real thoughts,
she seemed to veil them out of habit.</p>

<p>Suddenly one of the doors opened and Bain and Chiad
slipped in, without their spears. Bain was carrying a large white
bowl and a fat pitcher with steam rising from the top. Chiad had
towels folded under her arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are <em>you</em> bringing this?&rdquo; Moiraine
demanded.</p>

<p>Chiad shrugged. &ldquo;She would not come in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand barked a laugh. &ldquo;Even the servants know enough
to stay clear of me. Put it anywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your time is running out, Rand,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;The
Tairens are becoming used to you, after a fashion, and no one fears
what is familiar as much as what is strange. How many weeks, or
days, before someone tries to put an arrow in your back or poison
in your food? How long before one of the Forsaken strikes, or
another bubble comes sliding along the Pattern?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to harry me, Moiraine.&rdquo; He was blood
filthy, half naked, more than half leaning on <em>Callandor</em> to
stay sitting up, but he managed to fill those words with quiet
command. &ldquo;I will not run for you, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Choose your way soon,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And this time,
inform me what you mean to do. My knowledge cannot aid you if you
refuse to accept my help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your help?&rdquo; Rand said wearily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your help.
But I will decide, not you.&rdquo; He looked at Perrin as if trying to
tell him something without words, something he did not want the
others to hear. Perrin had not a clue what it was. After a moment
Rand sighed; his head sank a little. &ldquo;I want to sleep. All of you,
go away. Please. We will talk tomorrow.&rdquo; His eyes flickered to
Perrin again, underscoring the words for him.</p>

<p>Moiraine crossed the room to Bain and Chiad, and the
two Aiel women leaned close so she could speak for their ears
alone. Perrin heard only a buzz, and wondered if she was using the
Power to stop him eavesdropping. She knew the keenness of his
hearing. He was sure of it when Bain whispered back and he still
could not make out anything. The Aes Sedai had done nothing about
his sense of smell, though. The Aiel women looked at Rand as they
listened, and they smelled wary. Not afraid, but as if Rand were a
large animal that would be dangerous if they misstepped.</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai turned back to Rand. &ldquo;We <em>will</em>
talk tomorrow. You cannot sit like a partridge waiting for a
hunter&rsquo;s net.&rdquo; She was moving for the door before Rand could reply.
Lan looked at Rand as if about to say something, but followed her
without speaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand?&rdquo; Perrin said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do what we have to.&rdquo; Rand did not look up from
the clear hilt between his hands. &ldquo;We all do what we have to.&rdquo; He
smelled afraid.</p>

<p>Perrin nodded and followed Rhuarc out of the room.
Moiraine and Lan were nowhere in sight. The Tairen officer was
staring at the doors from ten paces off, trying to pretend the
distance was his choice and had nothing to do with the four Aiel
women watching him. The other two Maidens were still in the
bedchamber, Perrin realized. He heard voices from the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; Rand said tiredly. &ldquo;Just put that down and
go away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you can stand up,&rdquo; Chiad said cheerfully, &ldquo;we
will. Only stand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was the sound of water splashing into a bowl.
&ldquo;We have tended to wounded before,&rdquo; Bain said in soothing tones.
&ldquo;And I used to wash my brothers when they were little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rhuarc pushed the door shut, cutting off the
rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not treat him the way the Tairens do,&rdquo; Perrin
said quietly. &ldquo;No bowing and scraping. I don&rsquo;t think I have heard
one of you call him Lord Dragon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Dragon Reborn is a wetlander prophecy,&rdquo; Rhuarc
said. &ldquo;Ours is He Who Comes With the Dawn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought they were the same. Else why did you come
to the Stone? Burn me, Rhuarc, you Aiel are the People of the
Dragon, just as the Prophecies say. You&rsquo;ve as good as admitted it,
even if you won&rsquo;t say it out loud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rhuarc ignored the last part. &ldquo;In your Prophecies of
the Dragon, the fall of the Stone and the taking of <em>
Callandor</em> proclaim that the Dragon has been Reborn. Our
prophecy says only that the Stone must fall before He Who Comes
With the Dawn appears to take us back to what was ours. They may be
one man, but I doubt even the Wise Ones could say for sure. If Rand
is the one, there are things he must do yet to prove it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Perrin demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he is the one, he will know, and do them. If he
does not, then our search still goes on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something unreadable in the Aielman&rsquo;s voice pricked
Perrin&rsquo;s ears. &ldquo;And if he isn&rsquo;t the one you search for? What then,
Rhuarc?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sleep well and safely, Perrin.&rdquo; Rhuarc&rsquo;s soft boots
made no sound on the black marble as he walked away.</p>

<p>The Tairen officer was still staring past the
Maidens, smelling of fear, failing to mask the anger and hatred on
his face. If the Aiel decided Rand was not He Who Comes With the
Dawn&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Perrin studied the Tairen officer&rsquo;s face and thought of
the Maidens not being there, of the Stone empty of Aiel, and he
shivered. He had to make sure Faile decided to leave. That was all
there was for it. She had to decide to go, and without him.</p>
