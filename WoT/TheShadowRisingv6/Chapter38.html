<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
Garden of Silver Breezes was not a garden at all
but a huge wineshop, much too large to be called a shop really,
atop a hill centered on the Calpene, the westernmost of Tanchico&rsquo;s
three peninsulas below the Great Circle. A part of the name, at
least, came from the breezes that wafted in where polished
green-streaked marble columns and balustrades replaced one wall
except on the topmost floor. Golden oiled-silk curtains could be
lowered in case of rain. The hill fell away sharply on that side,
and the tables along the balustrades gave a clear view, across
white domes and spires, of the great harbor, crowded with more
ships than ever. Tanchico needed everything, desperately, and there
was gold to be made&mdash;until the gold and time ran out.</p>

<p>With its gilded lamps and ceilings inlaid with brass
fretwork polished to a golden gleam, its serving women and men
chosen for grace and beauty and discretion, the Garden of the
Silver Breezes had been the most expensive wineshop in the city
even before the troubles. Now it was outrageous. But those who
dealt in huge sums still came, those who dealt in power and
influence, or thought they did. In some ways there was less to deal
in than before; in others, more.</p>

<p>Low walls surrounded each table, making islands dotted
across the green and golden floor tiles. Each wall, pierced with
lacy carving so no eavesdropper could listen unseen, stood just
high enough to hide who met whom from the casual glances of
passersby. Even so, patrons usually went masked, especially of
late, and some had a bodyguard beside their table, also masked to
avoid recognition if the patron was prudent. And tongueless, rumor
said, for the most prudent. No guard was visibly armed; the
proprietress of the Garden of Silver Breezes, a sleek woman of
indeterminate age named Selindrin, allowed no weapons past the
street now. Her rule was not broken, at least openly.</p>

<p>From her usual table against the balustrade, Egeanin
watched the ships in the harbor, especially those under sail. They
made her want to be back on a deck giving orders. She had never
expected duty to bring her to this.</p>

<p>Unconsciously she adjusted the velvet mask that hid
the upper half of her face; she felt ridiculous wearing the thing,
but it was necessary to blend in to some extent. The mask&mdash;blue to match her high-necked silk gown&mdash;the gown itself, and
her dark hair, grown down to her shoulders now, were as far as she
could make herself go. Passing for a Taraboner was unnecessary&mdash;Tanchico bulged with refugees, a good many of them
foreigners swept up in the troubles&mdash;and it was beyond her in
any case. These people were animals; they had no discipline, no
order.</p>

<p>Regretfully, she turned from the harbor to her table
companion, a narrow-faced fellow with a weasel&rsquo;s greedy smile.
Floran Gelb&rsquo;s frayed collar did not belong in the Garden of Silver
Breezes, and he continually wiped his hands on his coat. She always
met them here, the greasy little men she was forced to deal with.
It was a reward for them, and a means of keeping them off
balance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you have for me, Master Gelb?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wiping his hands again, he lifted a coarse jute bag
onto the table and watched her anxiously. She held the bag down
beside her before opening it. A silvery metal <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> lay
inside, a collar and bracelet connected by a leash cunningly worked
and joined. She closed the bag and set it on the floor. This made
three that Gelb had recovered, more than anyone else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good, Master Gelb.&rdquo; A small purse went across
the table the other way; Gelb made it disappear under his coat as
if it held the Empress&rsquo;s crown instead of a handful of silver. &ldquo;And
do you have anything else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those women. The ones you want me to look for?&rdquo; She
had grown used to the quick speech of these people, but she wished
he would not lick his lips that way. It did not make him any harder
to understand, but it was unsightly.</p>

<p>She very nearly told him she was not interested
anymore. But this was a part of why she was in Tanchico, after all;
maybe the whole reason, now. &ldquo;What of them?&rdquo; That she could even
think of shirking her duty made her speak more harshly than she had
intended, and Gelb flinched.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I think I&rsquo;ve found another one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are sure? There have been&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;mistakes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mistakes was a gentle way to put it. Near a dozen
women who came only vaguely near the descriptions had been
nuisances she could ignore once she had seen them. But that
noblewoman, a refugee from estates burned out by the war. Gelb had
kidnapped the woman off the street, thinking to earn more for
delivering her than for telling where she was. In his defense, the
Lady Leilwin closely matched one of the women Egeanin sought, but
she had told him they would not speak with any accent he
recognized, certainly not a Taraboner accent. Egeanin had not
wanted to kill the woman, yet even in Tanchico someone might have
listened to her story. Leilwin had gone bound and gagged onto one
of the courier boats in the dead of night; she was young and
pretty, and someone would find a better use for her than slitting
her throat. But Egeanin was not in Tanchico to find serving girls
for the Blood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No mistakes, Mistress Elidar,&rdquo; he said hastily,
flashing that smile full of teeth. &ldquo;Not this time. But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I need
a little gold. To be sure. To get close enough. Four or five
crowns?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I pay for results,&rdquo; Egeanin told him firmly. &ldquo;After
your&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;mistakes, you are lucky that I pay you at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gelb licked his lips nervously. &ldquo;You said&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Back
in the beginning, you said you&rsquo;d have a few coins for those as
could do <em>special</em> sorts of work.&rdquo; A muscle in his cheek
twitched; his eyes darted as if someone might be listening at the
lace-carved wall around three sides of the table, and his voice
dropped to a hoarse whisper. &ldquo;Stirring up trouble, as it were? I
heard a rumor&mdash;from a fellow who&rsquo;s body-servant to Lord Brys&mdash;about the Assembly, and choosing the new Panarch. I think
maybe it&rsquo;s true. The man was drunk, and when he realized what he
had said, he nearly fouled himself. Even if it isn&rsquo;t, it would
still rip Tanchico wide open.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you really believe there is any need to buy
trouble in this city?&rdquo; Tanchico was a rotting bellfruit ready to
fall in the first wind. The whole of this wretched land was. For a
moment she was tempted to buy his &ldquo;rumor.&rdquo; She was supposed to be a
trader in whatever goods or information came along, and she had
even sold some. But dealing with Gelb sickened her. And her own
doubts frightened her. &ldquo;That will be all, Master Gelb. You know how
to make contact with me if you find another of these.&rdquo; She touched
the rough-woven sack.</p>

<p>Instead of rising, he sat staring, trying to see
through her mask. &ldquo;Where are you from, Mistress Elidar? The way you
talk, all slurred out and soft-like&mdash;begging your pardon; no
offense meant&mdash;I can&rsquo;t place you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will be all, Gelb.&rdquo; Maybe it was the
quarterdeck voice, or maybe the mask failed to hide her cold stare,
but Gelb bounced to his feet, ducking bows and stammering apologies
while he fumbled open the door in the lacework wall.</p>

<p>She sat there after he was gone, giving him time to
leave the Garden of Silver Breezes. Someone would follow him
outside, to make certain he did not wait to shadow her. All this
skulking and hiding disgusted her; she almost wished something
would destroy her disguise and give her an honest face-to-face
fight.</p>

<p>A new ship was sweeping into the harbor below, a Sea
Folk raker with its towering masts and clouds of sail. She had
examined a captured raker, but she would have given almost anything
to take one out, though she expected a Sea Folk crew would be
necessary to wring the most from the vessel. The Atha&rsquo;an Miere were
stubborn about taking the oaths; it would not be as good if she had
to buy a crew. Buy an entire crew! The amount of gold that came in
by the courier boats for her to fling about was going to her
head.</p>

<p>Taking up the jute bag, she started to rise, then sat
back down hurriedly at the sight of a wide, thick-shouldered man
leaving another table. Dark hair, long to his shoulders, and a
beard that left his upper lip bare framed Bayle Domon&rsquo;s round face.
He was not masked, of course; he ran a dozen coasting vessels in
and out of Tanchico and apparently did not care who knew his
whereabouts. Masked. She was not thinking straight. He would not
recognize her in a mask. Still, she waited until he was gone before
leaving her table. The man might have to be dealt with yet, if he
became a danger.</p>

<p>Selindrin took the gold she proffered with a sleek
smile and murmured wishes for Egeanin&rsquo;s continued patronage. Dark
hair in dozens of narrow braids, the proprietress of the Garden of
Silver Breezes wore clinging white silk, nearly thin enough for a
serving girl, and one of those transparent veils that always made
Egeanin want to ask Taraboners what dances they could perform. Shea
dancers wore almost identical veils and little more. Still,
Egeanin thought as she started toward the street, the woman had a
sharp mind, else she could not maneuver through the shoals of
Tanchico, catering to every faction while earning the enmity of
none.</p>

<p>A reminder of that was the tall, white-cloaked man,
gray at the temples but hard-faced and hard-eyed, who passed
Egeanin and was greeted by Selindrin. Jaichim Carridin&rsquo;s cloak bore
a golden sunburst on the breast, with four golden knots below and a
crimson shepherd&rsquo;s crook behind. An Inquisitor of the Hand of the
Light, a high officer in the Children of the Light. The very
concept of the Children outraged Egeanin, a military body
answerable only to itself. But Carridin and his few hundred
soldiers had power of a sort in Tanchico, where any kind of
authority seemed to be lacking most of the time. The Civil Watch no
longer patrolled the streets, and the army&mdash;as much as was
still loyal to the King&mdash;was too busy holding the fortresses
around the city. Egeanin noted that Selindrin did not even glance
at the sword on Carridin&rsquo;s hip. He definitely had power.</p>

<p>As soon as she stepped into the street her bearers
came running with her chair from the cluster waiting for their
patrons, and her bodyguards closed in around her with their spears.
They were a mismatched lot, some in steel caps, three wearing
leather shirts sewn with steel scales; rough-faced men, possibly
deserters from the army, but aware that continued full bellies and
silver to spend depended on her continued safety. Even the bearers
carried stout knives, and cudgels stuck out of their sashes. No one
who looked as though they had money dared appear out-of-doors
unguarded. In any case, had she cared to risk it, it would only
draw attention to her.</p>

<p>The guards forced a way through the crowds with no
trouble. The throngs eddied and swirled in the narrow streets that
wound through the city&rsquo;s hills, creating clear pockets around sedan
chairs surrounded by bodyguards. There were very few carriages to
be seen. Horses were becoming an extravagance.</p>

<p>Worn was the only fit description for the milling
masses, worn and frenzied. Worn faces, worn clothes, and
too-bright, frenzied eyes, desperate, hoping when they knew there
was no hope. Many had surrendered, crouching against walls, huddled
in doorways, clutching wives, husbands, children, not simply worn
but ragged and blank-faced. Sometimes they roused enough to cry out
to some passerby for a coin, a crust, anything.</p>

<p>Egeanin kept her eyes straight ahead, of necessity
trusting the bodyguards to detect any danger. Meeting a beggar&rsquo;s
eyes meant twenty of them jamming themselves hopefully around her
chair. Tossing a coin meant a hundred crowding in, clamoring and
weeping. She was already using part of the money the courier boats
brought to support a soup kitchen, just as if she were one of the
Blood. She shuddered to think what discovery of that overstepping
of her place would mean. As well put on a brocaded robe and shave
her head.</p>

<p>All of this could be put aright once Tanchico fell,
with everyone fed, everyone put in their proper place. And she
could abandon dresses and things she had no experience or taste
for, return to her ship. Tarabon, at least, and perhaps Arad Doman
as well, were ready to crumble at a touch, like charred silk. Why
was the High Lady Suroth holding back? Why?</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Jaichim Carridin lounged in his chair, cloak spread
over the carved arms, studying the Taraboner noblemen who occupied
the private room&rsquo;s other chairs. They sat stiffly in their
gold-embroidered coats, mouths tight below masks fancifully worked
to resemble hawks&rsquo; faces, and lions&rsquo; and leopards&rsquo;. He had more to
worry him than they, but he managed a calm demeanor. It was two
months since he had received word of a cousin found skinned alive
in his own bedchamber, three since his youngest sister, Dealda,
being carried off from her bridal feast by a Myrddraal. The family
steward wrote disbelievingly, frantic with all the tragedy
befalling House Carridin. Two months. He hoped Dealda had died
quickly. It was said women did not cling to sanity long in
Myrddraal hands. Two whole months. Anyone else but Jaichim Carridin
would have been sweating blood.</p>

<p>Each man held a golden goblet of wine, but there were
no servants present. Selindrin had served them before removing
herself with an assurance that they would not be disturbed. There
was, in fact, no one else on this, the highest floor of the Garden
of Silver Breezes. Two men who had come with the nobles&mdash;members of the King&rsquo;s Life Guard, unless Carridin missed his guess&mdash;stood at the foot of the stairs to guarantee continued
privacy.</p>

<p>Carridin sipped his wine. None of the Taraboners had
touched theirs. &ldquo;So,&rdquo; he said lightly, &ldquo;King Andric wishes the
Children of the Light to aid in restoring order in the city. We do
not often let ourselves become involved in the internal affairs of
nations.&rdquo; Not openly. &ldquo;Certainly I cannot remember such a request.
I do not know what the Lord Captain Commander will say.&rdquo; Pedron
Niall would say to do what was needed and make sure the Taraboners
knew that they owed a debt to the Children, make sure they paid it
in full.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no time for you to request instructions
from Amador,&rdquo; a man in a black-spotted leopard mask said urgently.
None had offered names, but Carridin did not need them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What we ask is necessary,&rdquo; another snapped, his
thick mustache below a hawk mask giving him the look of a peculiar
owl. &ldquo;You must understand that we would not make this request
unless it were necessary in the extreme. We must have unity, not
more division, yes? There are many divisive elements, even within
Tanchico. They must be suppressed if there is to be even the hope
of imposing peace on the countryside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The death of the Panarch has made matters most
difficult,&rdquo; the first fellow added.</p>

<p>Carridin raised an eyebrow questioningly. &ldquo;Have you
discovered yet who killed her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His own supposition was that Andric himself had had
the deed done, in the belief that the Panarch favored one of the
rebel claimants to the throne. The King may have been right, but he
had discovered after calling what he could of the Assembly of Lords&mdash;a good many were with one or another of the rebel groups out
in the country&mdash;that they were remarkably stubborn about
ratifying his choice. Even had the Lady Amathera not been currently
sharing Andric&rsquo;s bed, election of King and Panarch was the only
real power the Assembly had, and they did not seem to want to give
it up. The difficulties over the Lady Amathera were not supposed to
be known. Even the Assembly realized that that news might set off
riots.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the Dragonsworn madmen assuredly,&rdquo; the
owl-looking man said, giving his mustache a fierce tug. &ldquo;No true
Taraboner would harm the Panarch, yes?&rdquo; He almost sounded as if he
believed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Carridin said smoothly. He took another
sip of wine. &ldquo;If I am to secure the Panarch&rsquo;s Palace for the
ascension of the Lady Amathera, I must hear from the King himself.
Otherwise, it might appear the Children of the Light were reaching
for power in Tarabon, when all we seek is, as you say, an end to
division, and peace under the Light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An older, square-jawed leopard, white streaking his
dark yellow hair, spoke up in cold tones. &ldquo;I have heard that Pedron
Niall seeks unity against the Dragonsworn. Unity under himself, is
it not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Lord Captain Commander seeks no dominion,&rdquo;
Carridin replied just as icily. &ldquo;The Children serve the Light, as
do all men of good will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There can be no question,&rdquo; the first leopard put in,
&ldquo;of Tarabon being subject in any way to Amador. No question!&rdquo; Angry
agreement rumbled from nearly every chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; Carridin said as though the thought
had never crossed his mind. &ldquo;If you wish my aid, I will give it&mdash;under the conditions I have stated. If you do not, there is
always work for the Children. Service to the Light never ends, for
the Shadow waits everywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will have sureties signed and sealed by the
King,&rdquo; a graying, lion-masked man said, the first words he had
spoken. He was, of course, Andric himself, though Carridin was not
supposed to know. The King could not meet with an Inquisitor of the
Hand of the Light without causing talk any more than he could visit
a wineshop, even the Garden of Silver Breezes.</p>

<p>Carridin nodded. &ldquo;When they are in my hand, I will
secure the Panarch&rsquo;s Palace, and the Children will suppress any&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;divisive elements&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;who attempt to interfere with the
investiture. Under the Light, I swear it.&rdquo; Tension drained out of
the Taraboners visibly; they upended their goblets as if trying to
replace it with wine, even Andric.</p>

<p>So far as the people of Tarabon were concerned, the
Children would have the blame for the inevitable killings, not the
King, or the army of Tarabon. Once Amathera was invested with the
Crown and Staff of the Tree, a few more of the Assembly might well
join the rebels, but if the rest admitted they had not elected her
the news would set Tanchico afire. As for any tales that came from
those who fled&mdash;why, rebels would spread any sort of
treasonous lie. And the King and Panarch of Tarabon would both
dangle on strings Carridin could hand to Pedron Niall to do with as
he pleased.</p>

<p>Not such a grand prize as it would have been when the
King of Tarabon controlled more than a few hundred square miles
around Tanchico, yet it might be grand again. With the aid of the
Children&mdash;a legion or two would be needed at least; not just
the five hundred men Carridin had&mdash;the Dragonsworn might yet
be crushed, the various rebels defeated, even the war with Arad
Doman successfully prosecuted. If either country still realized it
was fighting the other. Arad Doman was in worse condition than
Tarabon, so Carridin heard.</p>

<p>In truth, he hardly cared if Tarabon fell under the
Children&rsquo;s sway, or Tanchico, or any of it. There were motions to
go through, things to do that he had always done, but it was
difficult to think of anything except when his own throat would be
cut. Perhaps he would long to have his throat cut. Two whole months
since the last report.</p>

<p>He did not stay to drink with the Taraboners, but
made his goodbyes, as shortly as he could. If they took offense,
they needed him too much to show it. Selindrin saw him come down,
and a stableboy was trotting his horse up to the front door when he
reached the street. Tossing the boy a copper, he spurred the black
gelding to a quick canter. The ragged folk in the twisty streets
got out of his way, which was to the good; he was not sure he would
notice if he trampled one of them. Not that it would be any loss.
The city was full of beggars; he could hardly breathe without the
stench of old, sour sweat and dirt. Tamrin ought to sweep them up
and sweep them out; let the rebels in the country contend with
them.</p>

<p>It was the country that held his mind, but not the
rebels. They could be dealt with easily enough, after word began to
spread that this one or that was a Darkfriend. And once he managed
to turn a few of them over to the Hand of the Light, they would
stand up before everyone and confess to worshipping the Dark One,
eating children, anything and everything they were told. The rebels
could not last long after that; the pretenders still in the field
would wake to find themselves alone. But the Dragonsworn, the men
and women who had actually declared for the Dragon Reborn, would
not fall away for a charge of being Darkfriends. Most people
already considered them so, swearing to follow a man who could
channel.</p>

<p>It was the man they had sworn to follow who was the
problem, the man whose name they did not even know. Rand al&rsquo;Thor.
Where was he? A hundred bands of Dragonsworn out there, at least
two large enough to be called armies, fighting the King&rsquo;s army&mdash;such of it as still held allegiance to Andric&mdash;fighting the rebels&mdash;who were busy fighting each other as
often as Andric or the Dragonsworn&mdash;yet Carridin had no clue
to which band sheltered Rand al&rsquo;Thor. He could be on Almoth Plain
or in Arad Doman, where the situation was the same. If he was,
Jaichim Carridin was a dead man in all likelihood.</p>

<p>At the palace on the Verana he had commandeered for
the Children&rsquo;s headquarters, he tossed his reins to one of the
white-cloaked guards and stalked inside without returning their
salutes. The owner of this ornate mass of pale domes and lacy
spires and shaded gardens had put forward a claim to the Throne of
the Light, and no one complained at the occupation. Least of all
the owner; what was left of his head still adorned a spike above
the Traitors&rsquo; Steps, on the Maseta.</p>

<p>For once Carridin barely glanced at fine Tarabon
carpets, or furnishings worked with gold and ivory, or fountained
courts where splashing water made a cool sound. Broad hallways with
golden lamps and high ceilings covered in delicate gold-work
scrolls interested him not at all. This palace could match the
finest in Amadicia, if not the largest, yet foremost in his mind
right then was the strong brandy in the room he had taken for a
study.</p>

<p>He was halfway across a priceless carpet, all
patterned blue and scarlet and gold, eyes fixed on the carved
cabinet that held a silver flask of double-distilled brandy, when
suddenly he realized he was not alone. A woman in a clinging,
pale-red gown stood near the tall, narrow windows overlooking one
of the tree-shaded gardens, her honey-colored hair in braids that
brushed her shoulders. A misty scrap of veil did nothing to hide
her face. Young and pretty, with a rosebud mouth and large brown
eyes, she was no servant, not dressed like that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he demanded irritably. &ldquo;How did you
get in here? Leave at once, or I&rsquo;ll have you tossed into the
street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Threats, Bors? You should be more welcoming to a
guest, yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That name jolted him to his heels. Before he thought,
he had his sword out, lunging for her throat.</p>

<p>Something seized him&mdash;the air turned to
crawling jelly&mdash;something forced him to his knees, encased
him from the neck down. It tightened around his wrist until bones
grated; his hand popped open, and his sword fell. The Power. She
was using the One Power on him. A Tar Valon witch. And if she knew
that name&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember,&rdquo; she said, coming closer, &ldquo;a
meeting where Ba&rsquo;alzamon himself appeared, and showed us the faces
of Matrim Cauthon, and Perrin Aybara, and Rand al&rsquo;Thor?&rdquo; She
practically spat the names, especially the last; her eyes could
have drilled holes in steel. &ldquo;You see? I know who you are, yes? You
pledged your soul to the Great Lord of the Dark, Bors.&rdquo; Her sudden
laugh was a tinkling of bells.</p>

<p>Sweat popped out on his face. Not just a despised Tar
Valon witch. Black Ajah. She was Black Ajah. He had thought it
would be a Myrddraal that came for him. He had thought there was
time yet. More time. Not yet. &ldquo;I have tried to kill him,&rdquo; he
babbled. &ldquo;Rand al&rsquo;Thor. I have tried! But I cannot find him. I
cannot! I was told my family would be killed if I failed, one by
one. I was promised I would be last! I have cousins, yet. Nephews.
Nieces. I have another sister! You must give me more time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stood there, watching him with those sharp brown
eyes, smiling with that plump little mouth, listening to him spew
out where Vanora could be found, where her bedchamber lay, how she
liked to ride alone in the forest beyond Carmera. Perhaps if he
shouted some of the guards would come. Perhaps they could kill her.
He opened his mouth wider&mdash;and that thick invisible jelly
oozed in, forcing his jaws apart until they creaked in his ears.
Nostrils flaring, he sucked air in frantically. He could still
breathe, but he could not scream. All that came out were muffled
groans, like a woman wailing behind walls. He wanted to scream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very amusing,&rdquo; the honey-haired woman said
finally. &ldquo;Jaichim. That is a good name for a dog, I think. Would
you like to be my dog, Jaichim? If you are a very good dog, I may
allow you to watch Rand al&rsquo;Thor die one day, yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It took a moment for what she was saying to sink in.
If he was to see Rand al&rsquo;Thor die, she was not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She was not
going to kill him, skin him alive, do the things his mind had
conjured that would make flaying a release. Tears rolled down his
face. Sobs of relief shook him, as much as he could shake, trapped
as he was. That trap abruptly vanished, and he collapsed on hands
and knees, still weeping. He could not stop.</p>

<p>The woman knelt beside him and tangled a hand in his
hair, pulled his head up. &ldquo;Now you will listen to me, yes? The
death of Rand al&rsquo;Thor is for the future, and you will see it only
if you are a good dog. You are going to move your Whitecloaks to
the Panarch&rsquo;s Palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;H-how do y-you know that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook his head from side to side, not gently. &ldquo;A
good dog does not question his mistress. I throw the stick; you
fetch the stick. I say kill; you kill. Yes? Yes.&rdquo; Her smile was
just a flash of teeth. &ldquo;There will be difficulty in taking the
Palace? The Panarch&rsquo;s Legion is there, a thousand men, sleeping in
the hallways, the exhibition rooms, the courtyards. You do not have
so many of your Whitecloaks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He had to stop and swallow. &ldquo;They will
make no trouble. They will believe Amathera has been chosen by the
Assembly. It is the Assembly that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not bore me, Jaichim. I do not care if you kill
the entire Assembly so long as you hold the Panarch&rsquo;s Palace. When
will you move?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;it will take three or four days for Andric
to deliver sureties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three or four days,&rdquo; she murmured half to herself.
&ldquo;Very well. A little longer delay should cause no harm.&rdquo; He was
wondering what delay she meant when she cut away the little ground
remaining under his feet. &ldquo;You will keep control of the Palace, and
you will send the Panarch&rsquo;s fine soldiers away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is impossible,&rdquo; he gasped, and she jerked his
head back so hard he did not know if his neck would break or his
scalp tear loose first. He did not dare resist. A thousand
invisible needles pricked him, on his face, his chest, his back,
arms, legs, everywhere. Invisible, but he was sure no less real for
that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible, Jaichim?&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;Impossible
is a word I do not like to hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The needles twisted deeper; he groaned, but he had to
explain. What she wanted <em>was</em> impossible. He panted with
haste. &ldquo;Once Amathera is invested as Panarch, she will control the
Legion. If I try to hold the Palace, she will turn them on me, and
Andric will help her. There is no way I can hold against the
Panarch&rsquo;s Legion, and against whatever Andric can strip from the
Ring forts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She studied him so long he began to sweat. He did not
dare to flinch, hardly even to blink; those thousand biting little
stabs did not allow it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Panarch will be dealt with,&rdquo; she said finally.
The needles vanished, and she stood.</p>

<p>Carridin stood, too, trying to steady himself.
Perhaps some bargain could be reached; the woman seemed willing to
listen to reason now. His legs quivered with shock, but he made his
voice as firm as he could. &ldquo;Even if you can influence Amathera&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She cut him off. &ldquo;I told you not to question,
Jaichim. A good dog obeys his mistress, yes? I promise you, if you
do not you will beg me to find a Myrddraal to play with you. Do you
understand me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he said leadenly. She continued to
stare, and after a moment he did understand. &ldquo;I will do as you say&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;mistress.&rdquo; Her brief, approving smile made him flush. She
moved toward the door, turning her back on him as if he really were
a dog, and a toothless one. &ldquo;What&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? What is your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her smile was sweet this time, and mocking. &ldquo;Yes. A
dog should know his mistress&rsquo;s name. I am called Liandrin. But that
name must never touch a dog&rsquo;s lips. Should it, I will be most
displeased with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the door closed behind her, he staggered to a
high-backed chair inlaid with ivory and fell into it. The brandy he
left where it was; the way his stomach was twisting, it would make
him vomit. What interest could she possibly have in the Panarch&rsquo;s
Palace? A dangerous line of questioning, perhaps, but even if they
served the same master he could not feel anything but revulsion for
a Tar Valon witch.</p>

<p>She did not know as much as she thought. With the
King&rsquo;s sureties in hand, he could keep Tamrin and the army away
from his throat with the threat of revelation, and Amathera, too.
They could still rouse the mob, though. And the Lord Captain
Commander might be more than disapproving of the entire affair,
might believe he was reaching for personal power. Carridin dropped
his head in his hands, envisioning Niall signing his death warrant.
His own men would arrest him; and hang him. If he could arrange the
death of the witch&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;But she had promised to protect him from
the Myrddraal. He wanted to weep again. She was not even here, yet
she had him trapped as tightly as ever, steel jaws clamped on both
legs and a noose snug around his neck.</p>

<p>There had to be a way out, but every way he looked
there was only another trap.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Liandrin ghosted through the halls, easily avoiding
servants and Whitecloaks. When she stepped out of a small back door
into a narrow alley behind the palace, the tall young guard there
stared at her with a blend of relief and unease. Her little trick
of opening someone to her suggestions&mdash;just a whip-crack
trickle of the Power&mdash;had not been needed with Carridin, but
it had easily convinced this fool that she should be allowed in.
Smiling, she motioned him to bend closer. The lanky lout grinned as
if expecting a kiss, a grin that froze as her narrow blade went
through his eye.</p>

<p>She leaped nimbly back as he fell, a boneless sack of
flesh. He would not speak of her even by accident now. Not so much
as a spot of blood stained her hand. She wished she had Chesmal&rsquo;s
skill at killing with the Power, or even Rianna&rsquo;s lesser talent.
Strange that the ability to kill with the Power, to stop a heart or
boil blood in the veins, should be so closely linked to Healing.
She herself could not Heal much more than scrapes or bruises; not
that she had any interest in it.</p>

<p>Her sedan chair, red-lacquered and inlaid with ivory
and gold, was waiting at the end of the alley, and with it her
bodyguards, a dozen big men with faces like starving wolves. Once
in the streets, they cleared a path through the crowds with ease,
spears clubbing any not quick enough to move aside. They were all
dedicated to the Great Lord of the Dark, of course, and if they did
not know exactly who she was, they knew that other men had
disappeared, men who failed to serve properly.</p>

<p>The house she and the others had taken, two sprawling
stories of flat-roofed stone and white plaster on a hillside at the
base of the Verana, Tanchico&rsquo;s easternmost peninsula, belonged to a
merchant who had also sworn his oaths to the Great Lord. Liandrin
would have preferred a palace&mdash;one day perhaps she would have
the King&rsquo;s Palace on the Maseta; she had grown up staring enviously
at the Lords&rsquo; palaces, but why should she settle for one of them?&mdash;yet despite her preferences, it made sense to stay hidden
awhile yet. There was no way the fools in Tar Valon could suspect
they were in Tarabon, but the Tower was surely still hunting them,
and Siuan Sanche&rsquo;s pets could be sniffing anywhere.</p>

<p>Gates gave onto a small courtyard, windowless except
on the upper floor. Leaving the guards and bearers there, she
hurried inside. The merchant had furnished a few servants; all
sworn to the Great Lord, he assured them, but barely enough to
provide for eleven women who rarely stirred outside. One, a
sturdily handsome, dark-braided woman called Gyldin, was sweeping
the entry hall&rsquo;s red and white tiles when Liandrin entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are the others?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the front withdrawing room.&rdquo; Gyldin gestured to
the double-arched doors to the right as though Liandrin might not
know where that was.</p>

<p>Liandrin&rsquo;s mouth tightened. The woman did not curtsy;
she used no titles of respect. True, she did not know who Liandrin
really was, but Gyldin certainly knew she was high enough to give
orders and be obeyed, to send that fat merchant bowing and scraping
and bundling his family off to some hovel. &ldquo;You are supposed to be
cleaning, yes? Not standing about? Well, clean! There is dust
everywhere. If I find a speck of the dust this evening, you cow
you, I will have you beaten!&rdquo; She clamped her teeth shut. She had
copied the manner in which nobles and the wealthy spoke for so long
that sometimes she forgot her father had sold fruit from a barrow,
yet in one moment of anger the speech of a commoner rolled off her
tongue. Too much stress. Too much waiting. With a last, snapped,
&ldquo;Work!&rdquo; she pushed into the withdrawing room and slammed the door
behind her.</p>

<p>The others were not <em>all</em> there, which
irritated her even more, but enough. Round-faced Eldrith Jhondar,
seated at a lapis-inlaid table beneath a hanging on one
white-plastered wall, was making careful notes from a tattered
manuscript; sometimes she absently cleaned the nib of her pen on
the sleeve of her dark wool dress. Marillin Gemalphin sat beside
one of the narrow windows, blue eyes dreamily staring out at the
tiny fountain tinkling in a little courtyard, idly scratching the
ears of a scrawny yellow cat and apparently unaware of the hairs it
shed all over her green silk dress. She and Eldrith were both
Browns, but if Marillin ever found out that Eldrith was the reason
the stray cats she brought in continually disappeared, there would
be trouble.</p>

<p>They had been Browns. Sometimes it was difficult to
remember they no longer were, or that she herself was no longer a
Red. So much of what had marked them clearly as members of their
old Ajahs remained even now that they were openly pledged to the
Black. Take the two former Greens. Coppery-skinned, swan-necked
Jeaine Caide wore the thinnest, most clinging silk dresses she
could find&mdash;white, today&mdash;and laughed that the gowns
would have to do, since there was nothing available in Tarabon to
catch a man&rsquo;s eye. Jeaine was from Arad Doman; Domani women were
infamous for their scandalous clothes. Asne Zeramene, with her
dark, tilted eyes and bold nose, looked almost demure in pale gray,
plainly cut and high-necked, but Liandrin had heard her regret
leaving her Warders behind more than once. And as for Rianna
Andomeran&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Black hair with a stark white streak above her left
ear framed a face with the cold, arrogant certainty only a White
could assume.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is done,&rdquo; Liandrin announced. &ldquo;Jaichim Carridin
will move his Whitecloaks to the Panarch&rsquo;s Palace and hold it for
us. He does not yet know we will have guests&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;of course.&rdquo;
There were a few grimaces; changing Ajahs had certainly not altered
anyone&rsquo;s feelings toward men who hated women who could channel.
&ldquo;There is an interesting thing. He believed I was there to kill
him. For failing to kill Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That makes no sense,&rdquo; Asne said, frowning. &ldquo;We are
to bind him, control him, not kill him.&rdquo; She laughed suddenly, soft
and low, and leaned back in her chair. &ldquo;If there <em>is</em> a way
to control him, I would not mind binding him to me. He is a
good-looking young man, from the little I saw.&rdquo; Liandrin sniffed;
she had no liking for men at all.</p>

<p>Rianna shook her head worriedly. &ldquo;It makes troubling
sense. Our orders from the Tower were clear, yet it is also clear
that Carridin has others. I can only postulate dissension among the
Forsaken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Forsaken,&rdquo; Jeaine muttered, folding her arms
tightly; thin white silk molded her breasts even more revealingly.
&ldquo;What good are promises that we will rule the world when the Great
Lord returns if we are crushed between warring Forsaken first? Does
anyone believe we could stand against any of them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Balefire.&rdquo; Asne looked around, dark tilted eyes
challenging. &ldquo;Balefire will destroy even one of the Forsaken. And
we have the means to produce it.&rdquo; One of the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>
they had removed from the Tower, a fluted black rod a pace long,
had that use. None of them knew why they had been ordered to take
it, not even Liandrin herself. Too many of the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>
were like that, taken because they had been told to, with no
reasons given, but some orders had to be obeyed. Liandrin wished
they had been able to secure even one <em>angreal</em>.</p>

<p>Jeaine gave a sharp sniff. &ldquo;If any of us could
control it. Or have you forgotten that the one test we dared nearly
killed me? And burned a hole through both sides of the ship before
I could stop it? Fine good it would have done us to drown before
reaching Tanchico.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What need have we of balefire?&rdquo; Liandrin said. &ldquo;If
we can control the Dragon Reborn, let the Forsaken think how they
will deal with us.&rdquo; Suddenly she became aware of another presence
in the room. The woman Gyldin, wiping down a carved, low-backed
chair in one corner. &ldquo;What are you doing here, woman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cleaning.&rdquo; The dark-braided woman straightened
unconcernedly. &ldquo;You told me to clean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Liandrin almost struck out with the Power. Almost.
But Gyldin certainly did not know they were Aes Sedai. How much had
the woman heard? Nothing of importance. &ldquo;You will go to the cook,&rdquo;
she said in a cold fury, &ldquo;and tell him he is to strap you. Very
hard! And you are to have nothing to eat until the dust it is all
gone.&rdquo; Again. The woman had made her speak like a commoner
again.</p>

<p>Marillin stood, nuzzling the yellow cat&rsquo;s nose with
hers, and handed the creature to Gyldin. &ldquo;See that he gets a dish
of cream when the cook is done with you. And some of that nice
lamb. Cut it small for him; he doesn&rsquo;t have many teeth left, poor
thing.&rdquo; Gyldin looked at her, not blinking, and she added, &ldquo;Is
there something you don&rsquo;t understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo; Gyldin&rsquo;s mouth was tight. Perhaps she
did finally understand; she was a servant, not their equal.</p>

<p>Liandrin waited a moment after she left, the cat
cradled in her arms, then snatched open one of the doors. The,
entry hall was empty. Gyldin was not eavesdropping. She did not
trust the woman. But then, she could not think of anyone she did
trust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must be concerned with what concerns us,&rdquo; she
said tightly, closing the door. &ldquo;Eldrith, have you found a new clue
in those pages? Eldrith?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The plump woman gave a start, then stared around at
them, blinking. It was the first time she had raised her head from
the battered yellow manuscript; she seemed surprised to see
Liandrin. &ldquo;What? Clue? Oh. No. It is difficult enough getting into
the King&rsquo;s Library; if I extracted so much as a page, the
librarians would know it immediately. But if I disposed of them, I
would never find anything. That place is a maze. No, I found this
in a bookseller&rsquo;s near the King&rsquo;s Palace. It is an interesting
treatise on&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Embracing <em>saidar</em>, Liandrin sent the pages
showering across the floor. &ldquo;Unless they are a treatise on the
controlling of Rand al&rsquo;Thor, let them be burned! What have you
learned about what we seek?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eldrith blinked at the scattered papers. &ldquo;Well, it is
in the Panarch&rsquo;s Palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You learned that two days ago,&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it must be a <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. To control
someone who can channel must require the Power, and since it is a
specialized use that means a <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. We will find it
in the exhibition room, or perhaps among the Panarch&rsquo;s
collection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something new, Eldrith.&rdquo; With an effort Liandrin
made her voice less shrill. &ldquo;Have you found anything that is new?
Anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The round-faced woman blinked uncertainly. &ldquo;Actually&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does not matter,&rdquo; Marillin said. &ldquo;In a few days,
once they have invested their precious Panarch, we can begin
searching, and if we must inspect every candlestick, we will find
it. We are on the brink, Liandrin. We will put Rand al&rsquo;Thor on a
leash and teach him to sit up and roll over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; Eldrith said, smiling happily. &ldquo;On a
leash.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Liandrin hoped it was so. She was tired of waiting,
tired of hiding. Let the world know her. Let people bend knee as
had been promised when she first forswore old oaths for new.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Egeanin knew she was not alone as soon as she stepped
into her small house by the kitchen door, but she dropped her mask
and the jute bag carelessly on the table and walked over to where a
bucket of water stood beside the brick fireplace. As she bent to
take the copper ladle, her right hand darted into a low hollow
where two bricks had been removed behind the bucket; she spun
erect, a small crossbow in her hand. No more than a foot long, it
had little power or range, but she always kept it drawn, and the
dark stain tipping the sharp steel bolt would kill in a
heartbeat.</p>

<p>If the man leaning casually in the corner saw the
crossbow, he gave no outward sign. He was pale-haired and
blue-eyed, in his middle years, and good-looking if too slender for
her taste. Clearly he had watched her cross the narrow yard through
the iron-grilled window beside him. &ldquo;Do you think that I threaten
you?&rdquo; he said after a moment.</p>

<p>She recognized the familiar accents of home, but she
did not lower the crossbow. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For answer he dipped two fingers carefully into his
belt pouch&mdash;apparently he could see after all&mdash;and
brought out something small and flat. She motioned him to lay it on
the table and back up again.</p>

<p>Only after he was back in the corner did she move
close enough to pick up what he had set there. Never taking her
eyes or the crossbow away from him, she lifted it up where she
could see. A small ivory plaque bordered in gold, engraved with a
raven and a tower. The raven&rsquo;s eyes were black sapphires. A raven,
symbol of the Imperial family; the Tower of Ravens, symbol of
Imperial justice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Normally this would be enough,&rdquo; she told him, &ldquo;but
we are far from Seanchan, in a land where the bizarre is almost
commonplace. What other proof can you offer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Smiling with silent amusement, he removed his coat,
unlaced his shirt and stripped it off. On either shoulder was the
tattoo of raven and tower.</p>

<p>Most Seekers for Truth bore the ravens as well as the
tower, but not even someone who dared steal a Seeker&rsquo;s plaque would
have himself marked so. To wear the ravens was to be the property
of the Imperial family. There was an old story of a fool young lord
and lady who had themselves tattooed while drunk, some three
hundred years gone. When the then Empress learned of it, she had
them brought to the Court of the Nine Moons and set to scrubbing
floors. This fellow might be one of their descendants. The mark of
the raven was forever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My apologies, Seeker,&rdquo; she said, setting the
crossbow down. &ldquo;Why are you here?&rdquo; She did not ask a name; any he
gave might or might not be his.</p>

<p>He left her holding the plaque while he re-dressed
himself in a leisurely manner. A subtle reminder. She was a captain
and he property, but he was also a Seeker, and under the law he
could have her put to the question on his own authority. By law he
had the right to send her out to buy the rope to bind her while he
put her to the question right here, and he would expect her to
return with it. Flight from a Seeker was a crime. Refusal to
cooperate with a Seeker was a crime. She had never in her life
considered any criminal act, no more than she had considered
treason against the Crystal Throne. But if he asked the wrong
questions, demanded the wrong answers&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The crossbow was still
close to her hand, and Cantorin was far away. Wild thoughts.
Dangerous thoughts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I serve the High Lady Suroth and the <em>
Corenne</em>, for the Empress,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am checking on the
progress of the agents the High Lady has placed in these
lands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Checking? What had to be checked, and by a Seeker? &ldquo;I
have heard nothing of this from the courier boats.&rdquo; His smile
deepened, and she flushed. Of course the crews would not speak of a
Seeker. Yet he answered while lacing up his shirt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The courier boats are not to be risked with my
trips. I have taken passage on the vessels of a local smuggler, a
man called Bayle Domon. His craft stop everywhere in Tarabon and
Arad Doman and between.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard of him,&rdquo; she said calmly. &ldquo;All goes
well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does now. I am glad that you, at least,
understood your instructions properly. Among the others, only the
Seekers did. It is regrettable that there are not more Seekers with
the <em>Hailene</em>.&rdquo; Settling his coat on his shoulders, he
plucked the Seeker&rsquo;s plaque from her hand. &ldquo;There has been some
embarrassment over the return of <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> deserters. Such
desertions must not become common knowledge. Much better that they
simply vanish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Only because she had a little time to think was she
able to keep her face smooth. <em>Sul&rsquo;dam</em> had been left behind
in the debacle at Falme, she had been told. Possibly some had
deserted. Her instruction, delivered by the High Lady Suroth
herself, had been to return any who could be found, whether they
wanted to return or not, and if that was not possible, dispose of
them. The last had seemed only a final alternative. Until now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I regret that these lands do not know kaf,&rdquo; he said,
taking a seat at the table. &ldquo;Even in Cantorin, only the Blood still
have kaf. Or it was so when I left. Perhaps supply ships have
arrived from Seanchan since. Tea must do. Fix me tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She very nearly knocked him out of his chair. The man
was property. And a Seeker. She brewed tea. And served it to him,
standing beside his chair with the pot to keep his cup full. She
was surprised he did not ask her to don a veil and dance on the
table.</p>

<p>She was permitted to sit at last, after fetching pen
and ink and paper, but only to sketch maps of Tanchico and its
defenses, to draw every other city and town she knew the least
thing about. She listed the various forces in the field, as much as
she knew of their strength and loyalties, what she had deduced of
their dispositions.</p>

<p>When she was done, he stuffed it all in his pocket,
told her to send the contents of the jute sack by the next courier
boat, and left with one of those amused smiles, saying he might
check on her progress again in a few weeks.</p>

<p>She sat there for a long time after he was gone.
Every map she had drawn, every list she had made, duplicated papers
sent out by courier boats long since. Having her do it all again
while he watched might have been a punishment for forcing him to
show his tattoos. Deathwatch Guards flaunted their ravens; Seekers
rarely did. It might have been that. At least he had not gone down
to the basement before she arrived. Or had he? Had he just been
waiting for her to speak?</p>

<p>The stout iron lock hung seemingly undisturbed on the
door in the hall just beyond the kitchen, but it was said Seekers
knew how to open locks without keys. Taking the key from her belt
pouch, she unfastened the lock and went down the narrow steps.</p>

<p>One lamp on a shelf lit the dirt-floored basement.
Just four brick walls, cleared of everything that might help an
escape. A faint smell of the slop pail hung in the air. On the side
opposite the lamp, a woman in a dirty dress sat despondently on a
few rough woolen blankets. Her head lifted at the sound of
Egeanin&rsquo;s steps, dark eyes fearful and pleading. She had been the
first <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> Egeanin had found. The first, the only.
Egeanin had all but stopped looking, after she found Bethamin. And
Bethamin had been in this basement since, while courier boats came
and went.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did anyone come down here?&rdquo; Egeanin said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I heard footsteps overhead, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;No.&rdquo;
Bethamin stretched out her hands. &ldquo;Please, Egeanin. This is all a
mistake. You have known me for ten years. Take this thing off of
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A silver collar encircled her neck, attached by a
thick silver leash to a bracelet of the same metal that hung on a
peg a few feet above her head. It had been almost an accident,
putting it on her, simply a means of securing her for a few
moments. And then she had managed to knock Egeanin down, trying a
dashing for freedom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you bring it to me, I will,&rdquo; Egeanin said
angrily. She was angry with many things, not with Bethamin. &ldquo;Bring
the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> over here, and I will remove it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bethamin shivered, let her hands fall. &ldquo;It is a
mistake,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;A horrible mistake.&rdquo; But she made no move
toward the bracelet. Her first attempted flight had left her
writhing on the floor upstairs, wracked by nausea, and had left
Egeanin stunned.</p>

<p><em>Sul&rsquo;dam</em> controlled <em>damane</em>, women
who could channel, by means of <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>. It was <em>
damane</em> who could channel, not <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>. But an <em>
a&rsquo;dam</em> could only control a woman who could channel. No other
woman, and not a man&mdash;young men with that ability were
executed, of course&mdash;only a woman who could channel. A woman
who had that ability and was collared could not move more than a
few steps without her bracelet on the wrist of a <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>
to complete the link.</p>

<p>Egeanin felt very tired climbing the stairs and
locking the door again. She wanted some tea herself, but the little
the Seeker had left was cold, and she did not feel like brewing
more. Instead she sat down and pulled the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> out of the
jute bag. To her it was only finely jointed silver; she could not
use it, and it could not harm her unless somebody hit her with
it.</p>

<p>Even linking herself with an <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> that far,
denying its ability to control her, was enough to send a shiver
down her spine. Women who could channel were dangerous animals
rather than people. It had been they who Broke the World. They must
be controlled, or they would turn everyone into their property.
That was what she had been taught, what had been taught in Seanchan
for a thousand years. Strange that that seemed not to have happened
here. No. That was a dangerous, foolish line of thought.</p>

<p>Tucking the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> back into the bag, she
cleaned the tea things to settle her mind. She liked tidiness, and
there was a small satisfaction in making the kitchen so. Before she
realized it she was brewing a pot of tea for herself. She did not
want to think about Bethamin, and that was dangerously foolish too.
Settling herself back at the table, she stirred honey into a cup of
tea as black as she could make it. Not kaf, but it would do.</p>

<p>Despite her denials, despite her pleas, Bethamin
could channel. Could other <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>? Was that why the High
Lady Suroth wanted those left behind at Falme killed? It was
unthinkable. It was impossible. The yearly testings all across
Seanchan found every girl who had the spark of channeling in her:
each was struck from the rolls of citizens, struck from family
records, taken away to become collared <em>damane</em>. The same
testings found the girls who could learn to wear the bracelet of
the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>. No woman escaped being tested each year until
she was old enough that she would have begun channeling if the
spark was there. How could even one girl be taken for <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em> when she was <em>damane</em>? Yet there Bethamin was
in the basement, held by an <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> as by an anchor.</p>

<p>One thing was certain. The possibilities here were
potentially deadly. This involved the Blood, and Seekers. Maybe
even the Crystal Throne. Would the High Lady Suroth dare keep
knowledge of this sort from the Empress? A mere ship captain could
die screaming for a misplaced frown in that company, or find
herself property for a whim. She had to know more if she hoped to
avoid the Death of Ten Thousand Tears. To begin with, that meant
spreading more money to Gelb and other ferrety skulkers like him,
finding more <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> and seeing if <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> held
them. Beyond that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Beyond that she was sailing uncharted reefs
with no linesman in the bow.</p>

<p>Touching the crossbow, still lying there with its
lethal bolt, she realized that something else was certain. She was
not going to let the Seekers kill her. Not just to help the High
Lady Suroth keep a secret. Perhaps not for any reason. It was a
thought shiveringly close to treason, but it would not go
away.</p>
