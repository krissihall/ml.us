<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">L</span>ying
on sweat-soaked sheets, staring at the ceiling,
Perrin realized that the darkness was turning to gray. Soon the sun
would be edging above the horizon. Morning. A time for new hopes; a
time to be up and doing. New hopes. He almost laughed. How long had
he been awake? An hour or more, surely, this time. Scratching his
curly beard, he winced. His bruised shoulder had stiffened, and he
sat up slowly; sweat popped out on his face as he worked the arm.
He kept at it methodically, though, suppressing groans and now and
again biting back a curse, until he could move the arm freely, if
not comfortably.</p>

<p>Such sleep as he had managed had been broken and
fitful. When he was awake he had seen Faile&rsquo;s face, her dark eyes
accusing him, the hurt he had put there making him cringe inside.
When he slept, he dreamed of mounting a gallows, and Faile
watching, or worse, trying to stop it, trying to fight Whitecloaks
with their lances and swords, and he was screaming while they
fitted the noose around his neck, screaming because the Whitecloaks
were killing Faile. Sometimes she watched them hang him with a
smile of angry satisfaction. Small wonder such dreams wakened him
with a jerk. Once he had dreamed of wolves running out of the
forest to save both Faile and him&mdash;only to be spitted on
Whitecloak lances, shot down by their arrows. It had not been a
restful night. Washing and dressing as hurriedly as he could, he
left the room as if hoping to leave memories of his dreams
behind.</p>

<p>Little outward evidence remained of the night&rsquo;s
attack, here a sword-slashed tapestry, there a chest with a corner
splintered by an axe or a lighter patch on the stone-tiled floor
where a bloodstained rug had been removed. The majhere had her
liveried army of servants out in force, though many wore bandages,
sweeping, mopping, clearing away and replacing. She limped about
leaning on a stick, a broad woman with her gray hair pushed up like
a round cap by the dressing wound around her head, calling her
orders in a firm voice, with the clear intention of removing every
sign of the Stone&rsquo;s second violation. She saw Perrin and gave him
an infinitesimal curtsy. Even the High Lords did not get much more
from her, even when she was well. Despite all the cleaning and
scrubbing, under the smell of waxes and polishes and cleaning
fluids Perrin could still catch the faint scent of blood, sharply
metallic human blood, fetid Trolloc blood, acrid Myrddraal blood
with its stink that burned his nostrils. He would be glad to be
away from here.</p>

<p>The door to Loial&rsquo;s room was a span across and more
than two spans high, with an overlarge door handle in the shape of
entwined vines level with Perrin&rsquo;s head. The Stone had a number of
rarely used Ogier guest rooms; the Stone of Tear predated even the
age of great Ogier stoneworks, but it was a point of prestige to
use Ogier stonemasons, at least from time to time. Perrin knocked
and at the call of &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; in a voice like a slow avalanche,
lifted the handle and complied.</p>

<p>The room was on a scale with the door in every
dimension, yet Loial, standing in the middle of the leaf-patterned
carpet in his shirtsleeves, a long pipe in his teeth, reduced it
all to seemingly normal size. The Ogier stood taller than a Trolloc
in his wide-toed, thigh-high boots, if not so broad as one. His
dark green coat, buttoned to the waist, then flaring to his boot
tops like a kilt over baggy trousers, no longer looked odd to
Perrin, but one look was enough to tell this was not an ordinary
man in an ordinary room. The Ogier&rsquo;s nose was so broad as to seem a
snout, and eyebrows like long mustaches dangled beside eyes the
size of teacups. Tufted ears poked up through shaggy black hair
that hung nearly to his shoulders. When he grinned around his
pipestem at the sight of Perrin, it split his face in half.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Perrin,&rdquo; he rumbled, removing the
pipe. &ldquo;You slept well? Not easy, after such a night as that.
Myself, I have been up half the night, writing down what happened.&rdquo;
He had a pen in his other hand, and ink stains on his sausage-thick
fingers.</p>

<p>Books lay everywhere, on Ogier-sized chairs and the
huge bed and the table that stood as high as Perrin&rsquo;s chest. That
was no surprise, but what was a little startling was the flowers.
Flowers of every sort, in every color. Vases of flowers, baskets of
them, posies tied with ribbon or even string, great woven banks of
flowers standing about like lengths of garden wall. Perrin had
certainly never seen the like inside a room. Their scent filled the
air. Yet what really caught his eye was the swollen knot on Loial&rsquo;s
head, the size of a man&rsquo;s fist, and the heavy limp in Loial&rsquo;s walk.
If Loial had been hurt too badly to travel&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He felt ashamed at
thinking of it that way&mdash;the Ogier was a friend&mdash;but he
had to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were injured, Loial? Moiraine could Heal you.
I&rsquo;m sure she will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can get around with no trouble. And there were
so many who truly needed her help. I would not want to bother her.
It certainly is not enough to hamper me in my work.&rdquo; Loial glanced
at the table where a large cloth-bound book&mdash;large for
Perrin, but it would fit in one of the Ogier&rsquo;s coat pockets&mdash;lay open beside an uncorked ink bottle. &ldquo;I hope I wrote it all down
correctly. I did not see very much last night until it was
done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Loial,&rdquo; Faile said, standing up from behind one of
the banks of flowers with a book in her hands, &ldquo;is a hero.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin jumped; the flowers had masked her scent
completely. Loial made shushing noises, his ears twitching with
embarrassment, and waved his big hands at her, but she went on, her
voice cool but her eyes hot on Perrin&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He gathered as many children as he could&mdash;and
some of their mothers&mdash;into a large room, and held the door
alone against Trollocs and Myrddraal through the entire fight.
These flowers are from the women of the Stone, tokens to honor his
steadfast courage, his faithfulness.&rdquo; She made &ldquo;steadfast&rdquo; and
&ldquo;faithfulness&rdquo; crack like whips.</p>

<p>Perrin managed not to flinch, but only just. What he
had done was right, but he could not expect her to see it. Even if
she knew why, she would not see it. <em>It was the right thing. It
was</em>. He only wished he felt better about the entire matter. It
was hardly fair that he could be right and still feel in the
wrong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was nothing.&rdquo; Loial&rsquo;s ears twitched wildly. &ldquo;It
is just that the children could not defend themselves. That&rsquo;s all.
Not a hero. No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense.&rdquo; Faile marked her place in the book with a
finger and moved closer to the Ogier. She did not come up to his
chest. &ldquo;There is not a woman in the Stone who would not marry you,
if you were human, and some would anyway. Loial well named, for
your nature is loyalty. Any woman could love that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Ogier&rsquo;s ears went stiff with shock, and Perrin
grinned. She had obviously been feeding Loial honey and butter all
morning in hope the Ogier would agree to take her along no matter
what Perrin wanted, but in trying to prick him she had just fed
Loial a stone without knowing it. &ldquo;Have you heard from your mother,
Loial?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Loial managed to sound relieved and worried at
the same time. &ldquo;But I saw Laefar in the city yesterday. He was as
surprised to see me as I to see him; we are not a common sight in
Tear. He came from Sledding Shangtai to negotiate repairs on some
Ogier stonework in one of the palaces. I have no doubt the first
words out of his mouth when he returns to the <em>stedding</em>
will be &lsquo;Loial is in Tear.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is worrying,&rdquo; Perrin said, and Loial nodded
dejectedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laefar says the Elders have named me a runaway and
my mother has promised to have me married and settled. She even has
someone chosen. Laefar did not know who. At least, he said he did
not. He thinks such things are funny. She could be here in a
month&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faile&rsquo;s face was a picture of confusion that almost
made Perrin grin again. She thought she knew so much more than he
did about the world&mdash;well, she did, in truth&mdash;but she
did not know Loial. Stedding Shangtai was Loial&rsquo;s home, in the
Spine of the World, and since he was barely past ninety, he was not
old enough to have left on his own. Ogier lived a very long time;
by their standards, Loial was no older than Perrin, maybe younger.
But Loial had gone anyway, to see the world, and his greatest fear
was that his mother would find him and drag back to the <em>
stedding</em> to marry, never to leave again.</p>

<p>While Faile was trying to figure out what was going
on, Perrin stepped into the silence. &ldquo;I need to go back to the Two
Rivers, Loial. Your mother won&rsquo;t find you there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. That is true.&rdquo; The. Ogier gave an uncomfortable
shrug. &ldquo;But my book. Rand&rsquo;s story. And yours, and Mat&rsquo;s. I have so
many notes already, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He moved around behind the table,
peering down at the open book, the pages filled with his neat
script. &ldquo;I will be the one to write the true story of the Dragon
Reborn, Perrin. The only book by someone who traveled with him, who
actually saw it unfold. <em>The Dragon Reborn</em>, by Loial, son
of Arent son of Halan, of Stedding Shangtai.&rdquo; Frowning, he bent
over the book, dipping his pen in the ink bottle. &ldquo;That is not
quite right. It was more&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin put a hand on the page where Loial was going
to write. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll write no book if your mother finds you. Not about
Rand, at least. And I need you, Loial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Need, Perrin? I do not understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are Whitecloaks in the Two Rivers. Hunting
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hunting you? But why?&rdquo; Loial looked almost as
confused as Faile had, Faile, on the other hand, had donned a
complacent smugness that was worrisome. Perrin went on anyway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The reasons don&rsquo;t matter. The fact is that they are.
They may hurt people, my family, looking for me. Knowing
Whitecloaks, they will. I can stop it, if I can get there quickly,
but it must be quickly. The Light only knows what they&rsquo;ve done
already. I need you to take me there, Loial, by the Ways. You told
me once there was a Waygate here, and I know there was one at
Manetheren. It must still be there, in the mountains above Emond&rsquo;s
Field. Nothing can destroy a Waygate, you said. I need you,
Loial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, of course I will help,&rdquo; Loial said. &ldquo;The
Ways.&rdquo; He exhaled noisily, and his ears wilted a bit, &ldquo;I want to
write of adventures, not have them. But I suppose one more time
will not hurt. The Light send it so,&rdquo; he finished fervently.</p>

<p>Faile cleared her throat delicately. &ldquo;Are you not
forgetting something, Loial? You promised to take me into the Ways
whenever I asked, and before you took anyone else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did promise you a look at a Waygate,&rdquo; Loial said,
&ldquo;and what it is like inside. You can have that when Perrin and I
go. You could come with us, I suppose, but the Ways are not
traveled lightly, Faile. I would not enter them myself if Perrin
did not have need.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faile will not be coming,&rdquo; Perrin said firmly. &ldquo;Just
you and me, Loial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ignoring him, Faile smiled up at Loial as if he were
teasing her, &ldquo;You promised more than a look, Loial. To take me
wherever I wanted, whenever I wanted, and before anyone else. You
swore to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; Loial protested, &ldquo;but only because you
refused to believe I would show you. You said you would not believe
unless I swore. I will do as I promised, but surely you do not want
to step ahead of Perrin&rsquo;s need.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You swore,&rdquo; Faile said calmly. &ldquo;By your mother, and
your mother&rsquo;s mother, and your mother&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did, Faile, but Perrin&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You swore, Loial. Do you mean to break your
oath?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Ogier looked like misery stacked on misery. His
shoulders slumped and his ears drooped, the corners of his wide
mouth turned down and the ends of his long eyebrows draggled onto
his cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She tricked you, Loial.&rdquo; Perrin wondered if they
could hear his teeth grinding. &ldquo;She deliberately tricked you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Red stained Faile&rsquo;s cheeks, but she still had the
nerve to say, &ldquo;Only because I had to, Loial. Only because a fool
man thinks he can order my life to suit himself. I&rsquo;d not have done
it, otherwise. You must believe that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it make any difference that she tricked
you?&rdquo; Perrin demanded, and Loial shook his massive head sadly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ogier <em>keep</em> their word,&rdquo; Faile said. &ldquo;And
Loial is going to take me to the Two Rivers. Or to the Waygate at
Manetheren, at least. I have a wish to see the Two Rivers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial stood up straight, &ldquo;But that means I can help
Perrin after all. Faile, why did you drag this out? Even Laefar
would not think this funny.&rdquo; There was a touch of anger in his
voice; it took a good bit to make an Ogier angry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he asks,&rdquo; she said determinedly. &ldquo;That was part
of it, Loial. No one but you and me, unless they asked me. He has
to ask me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Perrin told her while Loial was still opening
his mouth. &ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t ask. I will ride to Emond&rsquo;s Field first.
I&rsquo;ll walk! So you might as well give up this foolishness. Tricking
Loial. Trying to force yourself in where&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;where you aren&rsquo;t
wanted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her calm dropped away in anger. &ldquo;And by the time you
reach there, Loial and I will have done for the Whitecloaks. It
will all be over. Ask, you anvil-headed blacksmith. Just ask and
you can come with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin took hold of himself. There was no way to
argue her around to his way of thinking, but he would not ask. She
was right&mdash;he would need weeks to reach the Two Rivers on his
horse; they could be there in two days, perhaps, through the Ways&mdash;but he would not ask. <em>Not after she tricked Loial and
tried to bully me!</em> &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll travel the Ways to Manetheren
alone. I&rsquo;ll follow you two. If I stay far enough back not to be
part of your party, I won&rsquo;t be breaking Loial&rsquo;s oath. You can&rsquo;t
stop me following.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is dangerous, Perrin,&rdquo; Loial said worriedly.
&ldquo;The Ways are dark. If you miss a turning, or take the wrong bridge
by accident, you could be lost forever. Or until <em>Machin
Shin</em> catches you. Ask her, Perrin. She said you can come if
you do. Ask her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Ogier&rsquo;s deep voice trembled speaking the name of
<em>Machin Shin</em>, and a shiver ran down Perrin&rsquo;s back, too.
<em>Machin Shin</em>. The Black Wind. Not even Aes Sedai knew
whether it was Shadowspawn or something that had grown out of the
Ways&rsquo; corruption. <em>Machin Shin</em> was why traveling the Ways
meant risking death; that was what Aes Sedai said. The Black Wind
ate souls; that Perrin knew for truth. But he kept his voice steady
and his face straight. <em>I&rsquo;ll be burned if I let her think I am
weakening</em>. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, Loial. Or anyway, I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial grimaced. &ldquo;Faile, it will be dangerous for him,
trying to follow us. Please relent and let him&mdash;&rdquo; She cut him
off sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. If he is too stiff-necked to ask, why should I?
Why should I even care if he does get lost?&rdquo; She turned to Perrin.
&ldquo;You can travel close to us. As close as you need to, so long as
it&rsquo;s plain you are following. You will trail after me like a puppy
until you ask. Why won&rsquo;t you just ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stubborn humans,&rdquo; the Ogier muttered. &ldquo;Hasty and
stubborn, even when haste lands you in a hornet nest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like to leave today, Loial,&rdquo; Perrin said,
not looking at Faile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Best to go quickly,&rdquo; Loial agreed with a regretful
look at the book on the table. &ldquo;I can tidy my notes on the journey,
I suppose. The Light knows what I will miss, being away from
Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear me, Perrin?&rdquo; Faile demanded,.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will get my horse and a few supplies, Loial. We
can be on our way by midmorning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn you, Perrin Aybara, answer me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial eyed her worriedly. &ldquo;Perrin, are you certain
you could not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Perrin interrupted gently. &ldquo;She is muleheaded,
and she likes playing tricks. I won&rsquo;t dance so she can laugh.&rdquo; He
ignored the sound coming from deep in Faile&rsquo;s throat, like a cat
staring at a strange dog and ready to attack. &ldquo;I will let you know
as soon as I am ready.&rdquo; He started for the door, and she called
after him furiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;When&rsquo; is my decision, Perrin Aybara. Mine and
Loial&rsquo;s. Do you hear me? You had better be ready in two hours, or
we&rsquo;ll leave you behind. You can meet us at the Dragonwall Gate
stable, if you&rsquo;re coming. Do you hear me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sensed her moving and shut the door behind him
just as something thumped into it heavily. A book, he thought.
Loial would give her fits about that. Better to hit Loial on the
head than harm one of his books.</p>

<p>For a moment he leaned against the door, despairing.
All he had done, all he had gone through, making her hate him, and
she was going to be there to see him die anyway. The best thing he
could say was that she might enjoy it now. <em>Stubborn, muleheaded
woman!</em></p>

<p>When he turned to go, one of the Aiel was
approaching, a tall man with reddish hair and green eyes who could
have been Rand&rsquo;s older cousin, or a young uncle. He knew the man,
and liked him, if only because Gaul had never given even a flicker
of notice to his yellow eyes. &ldquo;May you find shade this morning,
Perrin. The majhere told me you had come this way, though I think
she itched to put a broom in my hands. As hard as a Wise One, that
woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May you find shade this morning, Gaul. Women are all
hardheaded, if you ask me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so, if you do not know how to get &rsquo;round
them. I hear you are journeying to the Two Rivers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light!&rdquo; Perrin growled before the Aiel could say
more. &ldquo;Does the whole Stone know?&rdquo; If Moiraine knew&mdash;</p>

<p>Gaul shook his head. &ldquo;Rand al&rsquo;Thor took me aside and
spoke to me, asking me to tell no one. I think he spoke to others,
too, but I do not know how many will want to go with you. We have
been on this side of the Dragonwall for a long time, and many ache
for the Three-fold Land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come with me?&rdquo; Perrin felt stunned. If he had Aiel
with him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;There were possibilities he had not dared consider
before. &ldquo;Rand asked you to come with me? To the Two Rivers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gaul shook his head again. &ldquo;He said only that you
were going, and that there were men who might try to kill you. I
mean to accompany you, though, if you will have me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will I?&rdquo; Perrin almost laughed. &ldquo;I will that. We
will be into the Ways in a few hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Ways?&rdquo; Gaul&rsquo;s expression did not change, but he
blinked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does that make a difference?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Death comes for all men, Perrin.&rdquo; It was hardly a
comforting answer.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">&ldquo;I cannot believe Rand is that cruel,&rdquo; Egwene said,
and Nynaeve added, &ldquo;At least he did not try to stop you.&rdquo; Seated on
Nynaeve&rsquo;s bed, they were finishing the division of the gold
Moiraine had provided. Four fat purses apiece to be carried in
pockets sewn under Elayne&rsquo;s and Nynaeve&rsquo;s skirts, and another each,
not so large as to attract unwanted attention, to carry at the
belt. Egwene had taken a lesser amount, there being less use for
gold in the Waste.</p>

<p>Elayne frowned at the two neatly tied bundles and the
leather script lying beside the door. They held all of her clothes
and other things. Cased knife and fork, hairbrush and comb,
needles, pins, thread, thimble, scissors. A tinder box and a second
knife, smaller than the one at her belt. Soap and bath powder and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;It was ridiculous to go over the list again. Egwene&rsquo;s stone
ring was snug in her pouch. She was ready to go. There was nothing
to hold her back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he did not.&rdquo; Elayne was proud of how calm and
collected she sounded. <em>He seemed almost relieved! Relieved! And
I had to give him that letter, laying my heart open like a
stone-blind fool. At least he won&rsquo;t open it until I am gone</em>.
She jumped at the touch of Nynaeve&rsquo;s hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you want him to ask you to stay? You know what
your answer would have been. You do, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne compressed her lips. &ldquo;Of course I do. But he
did not have to look happy about it.&rdquo; She had not meant to say
that.</p>

<p>Nynaeve gave her an understanding look. &ldquo;Men are
difficult at the best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I still cannot believe he would be so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Egwene began in an angry mutter. Elayne never learned what she
meant to say, for at that moment the door crashed open so hard that
it bounced off the wall.</p>

<p>Elayne embraced <em>saidar</em> before she had
stopped flinching, then felt a moment of embarrassment when the
rebounding door slapped hard against Lan&rsquo;s outstretched hand. A
moment more, and she decided to hold on to the Source a while
longer. The Warder filled the doorway with his broad shoulders, his
face a thunderhead; if his blue eyes could really have given off
the thunderbolts they threatened, they would have blasted Nynaeve.
The glow of <em>saidar</em> surrounded Egwene, too, and did not
fade.</p>

<p>Lan did not appear to see anyone but Nynaeve. &ldquo;You
let me believe you were returning to Tar Valon,&rdquo; he rasped at
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may have believed it,&rdquo; she said calmly, &ldquo;but I
never said it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never said it? Never said it! You spoke of leaving
today, and always linked your leaving with those Darkfriends being
sent to Tar Valon. Always! What did you mean me to think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I never said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light, woman!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;Do not bandy words with
me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne exchanged worried looks with Egwene. This man
had an iron self-control, but he was at a breaking point now.
Nynaeve was one who often let her emotions rage, yet she faced him
coolly, head high and eyes serene, hands still on her green silk
skirts.</p>

<p>Lan took hold of himself with an obvious effort. He
appeared as stone-faced as ever, as much in control of himself&mdash;and
Elayne was sure it was all on the surface. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d not have known
where you were off to if I had not heard that you had ordered a
carriage. To take you to a ship bound for Tanchico. I do not know
why the Amyrlin allowed you to leave the Tower in the first place,
or why Moiraine involved you in questioning Black sisters, but you
three are Accepted. Accepted, not Aes Sedai. Tanchico now is no
place for anyone except a full Aes Sedai with a Warder to watch her
back. I&rsquo;ll not let you go into that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Nynaeve said lightly. &ldquo;You question Moiraine&rsquo;s
decisions, and those of the Amyrlin Seat as well. Perhaps I&rsquo;ve
misunderstood Warders all along. I thought you swore to accept and
obey, among other things. Lan, I do understand your concern, and I
am grateful&mdash;more than grateful&mdash;but we all have tasks
to perform. We are going; you must resign yourself to the
fact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why? For the love of the Light, at least tell me
why! Tanchico!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Moiraine has not told you,&rdquo; Nynaeve said gently,
&ldquo;perhaps she has her reasons. We must do our tasks, as you must do
yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan trembled&mdash;actually trembled!&mdash;and
clamped his jaw shut angrily. When he spoke, he was strangely
hesitant. &ldquo;You will need someone to help you in Tanchico. Someone
to keep a Taraboner street thief from slipping a knife into your
back for your purse. Tanchico was that sort of city before the war
began, and everything I&rsquo;ve heard says it is worse now. I could&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I could protect you, Nynaeve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s eyebrows shot up. He could not be suggesting&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He just could not be.</p>

<p>Nynaeve gave no sign that he had said anything out of
the ordinary. &ldquo;Your place is with Moiraine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moiraine.&rdquo; Sweat beaded on the Warder&rsquo;s hard face,
and he struggled with the words. &ldquo;I can&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I must&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Nynaeve,
I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You <em>will</em> remain with Moiraine,&rdquo; Nynaeve
said sharply, &ldquo;until she releases you from your bond. You will do
as I say.&rdquo; Pulling a carefully folded paper from her pouch, she
thrust it into his hands. He frowned, read, then blinked and read
again.</p>

<p>Elayne knew what it said.</p>

<p class="note">What the bearer does is done at my order and by my authority.
Obey, and keep silent, at my command.</p>

<p class="note_sig">Siuan Sanche<br>
Watcher of the Seals<br>
Flame of Tar Valon<br>
The Amyrlin Seat</p>

<p>The other like it rested in Egwene&rsquo;s pouch, though
none of them were sure what good it would do where she was
going.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this allows you to do anything you please,&rdquo; Lan
protested. &ldquo;You can speak in the Amyrlin&rsquo;s name. Why would she give
this to an Accepted?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask no questions I cannot answer,&rdquo; Nynaeve said,
then added with a hint of a grin, &ldquo;Just count yourself lucky I do
not tell you to dance for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne suppressed a smile of her own. Egwene made a
choking sound of swallowed laughter. It was what Nynaeve had said
when the Amyrlin first handed them the letters. <em>With this I
could make a Warder dance</em>. Neither of them had had any doubt
which Warder she had meant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you not? You dispose of me very neatly. My bond,
and my oaths. This letter.&rdquo; Lan had a dangerous gleam in his eye,
which Nynaeve seemed not to notice as she took back the letter and
replaced it in the-pouch on her belt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very full of yourself, al&rsquo;Lan Mandragoran.
We do as we must, as you will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Full of myself, Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara? <em>I</em> am full
of myself?&rdquo; Lan moved so quickly toward Nynaeve that Elayne very
nearly wrapped him in flows of Air before she could think. One
moment Nynaeve was standing there, with just time to gape at the
tall man sweeping toward her; the next her shoes were dangling a
foot off the floor and she was being quite thoroughly kissed. At
first she kicked his shins and hammered him with her fists and made
sounds of frantic, furious protest, but her kicks slowed and
stopped, and then she was holding on to his shoulders and not
protesting at all.</p>

<p>Egwene dropped her eyes with embarrassment, but
Elayne watched interestedly. Was that how she had looked when Rand&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>No! I will not think about him</em>. She wondered if
there was time to write him another letter, taking back everything
she had said in the first, letting him know she was not to be
trifled with. But did she want to?</p>

<p>After a while Lan set Nynaeve back on her feet. She
swayed a bit as she straightened her dress and patted her hair
furiously. &ldquo;You have no right&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; she began in a breathless
voice, then stopped to swallow. &ldquo;I will not be <em>manhandled</em>
in that fashion for the whole world to see. I will not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not the whole world,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;But if they can
see, they can hear as well. You have made a place in my heart where
I thought there was no room for anything else. You have made
flowers grow where I cultivated dust and stones. Remember this, on
this journey you insist on making. If you die, I will not survive
you long.&rdquo; He gave Nynaeve one of his rare smiles. If it did not
exactly soften his face, at least it made it less hard. &ldquo;And
remember also, I am not always so easily commanded, even with
letters from the Amyrlin.&rdquo; He made an elegant bow; for a moment
Elayne thought he actually meant to kneel and kiss Nynaeve&rsquo;s Great
Serpent ring. &ldquo;As you command,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;so do I obey.&rdquo; It was
difficult to tell whether he meant to be mocking or not.</p>

<p>As soon as the door closed behind him, Nynaeve sank
onto the edge of her bed as if letting her knees give way at last.
She stared at the door with a pensive frown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;Poke the meekest dog too often,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; Elayne quoted,
&ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;and he will bite.&rsquo; Not that Lan is very meek.&rdquo; She got a sharp
look and a sniff from Nynaeve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is insufferable,&rdquo; Egwene said. &ldquo;Sometimes he is.
Nynaeve, why did you do that? He was ready to go with you. I know
you want nothing more than to break him free of Moiraine. Do not
try to deny it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve did not try. Instead she fussed with her
dress, and smoothed the coverlet on the bed. &ldquo;Not like that,&rdquo; she
said finally. &ldquo;I mean him to be mine. All of him. I will not have
him remembering a broken oath to Moiraine. I will not have that
between us. For him, as well as myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But will it be any different if you bring him to ask
Moiraine to release him from his bond?&rdquo; Egwene asked. &ldquo;Lan is the
kind of man who would see it as much the same thing. All that
leaves is to somehow make her let him go of her own accord. How can
you manage that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo; Nynaeve firmed her voice. &ldquo;Yet what
must be done, can be done. There is always a way. That is for
another time. Work to be done, and we sit here fretting over men.
Are you sure you have everything you need for the Waste,
Egwene?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aviendha is readying everything,&rdquo; Egwene said. &ldquo;She
still seems unhappy, but she says we can reach Rhuidean in little
more than a month, if we are lucky. You will be in Tanchico by
then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps sooner,&rdquo; Elayne told her, &ldquo;if what they say
about Sea Folk rakers is true. You will be careful, Egwene? Even
with Aviendha for a guide, the Waste cannot be safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will. You be careful. Both of you. Tanchico is not
much safer than the Waste now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly they were all hugging one another, repeating
cautions to take care, making sure they all remembered the schedule
for meeting in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>&rsquo;s Stone.</p>

<p>Elayne wiped tears from her cheeks. &ldquo;As well Lan
left.&rdquo; She laughed tremulously. &ldquo;He would think we were all being
foolish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he would not,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, pulling up her
skirts to settle a purse of gold into its pocket. &ldquo;He may be a man,
but he is not a complete dolt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There had to be time between here and the carriage to
locate paper and pen, Elayne decided. She would find time. Nynaeve
had the right of it. Men needed a firm hand. Rand would find he
could not get away from her so easily. And he would not find it
easy to worm his way back into her good graces.</p>
