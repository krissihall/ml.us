<h4><em>Deceptions</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">F</span>avoring
his stiff right leg, Thom bowed with a
flourish of his gleeman&rsquo;s cloak that set the colorful patches
fluttering. His eyes felt grainy, but he made himself speak
lightly. &ldquo;A good morning to you.&rdquo; Straightening, he knuckled his
long white mustaches grandly.</p>

<p>The black-and-gold-clad servants looked surprised.
The two muscular lads straightened from the gold-studded red
lacquer chest, with a shattered lid, that they had been about to
lift, and the three women stilled their mops in front of them. The
hallway was empty along here except for them, and any excuse to
break their labor was good, especially at this hour. They looked as
tired as Thom felt, with slumping shoulders and dark circles under
their eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good morning to you, gleeman,&rdquo; the oldest of the
women said. A bit plump and plain-faced, perhaps, she had a nice
smile, weary as she was. &ldquo;Can we help you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom produced four colored balls from a capacious
coatsleeve and began to juggle. &ldquo;I am just going about trying to
raise spirits. A gleeman must do what he can.&rdquo; He would have used
more than four, but he was fatigued enough to make even that many
an exercise in concentration. How long since he had nearly dropped
a fifth ball? Two hours? He stifled a yawn, turned it into a
reassuring smile. &ldquo;A terrible night, and spirits need lifting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Lord Dragon saved us,&rdquo; one of the younger women
said. She was pretty and slim, but with a predatory gleam in her
dark, shadowed eyes that warned him to temper his smile. Of course,
she might be useful if she was both greedy and honest, meaning that
she would stay bought once he paid her. It was always good to find
another set of hands to place a note, a tongue that would tell him
what was heard and say what he wanted where he wanted. <em>Old
fool! You have enough hands and ears, so stop thinking of a fine
bosom and remember the look in her eye!</em> The interesting thing
was that she sounded as if she meant what she said, and one of the
young fellows nodded agreement to her words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Thom said. &ldquo;I wonder which High Lord had
charge of the docks yesterday?&rdquo; He nearly fumbled the balls in
irritation at himself. Bringing it right out like that. He was too
tired; he should be in his bed. He should have been there hours
ago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The docks are the Defenders&rsquo; responsibility,&rdquo; the
oldest woman told him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d not know that, of course. The High
Lords would not concern themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom knew it very well. &ldquo;Is that so? Well, I am not
Tairen, of course.&rdquo; He changed the balls from a simple circle to a
double loop; it looked more difficult than it was, and the girl
with the predatory look clapped her hands. Now that he was into it,
he might as well go on. After this, though, he would call it a
night. A night? The sun was rising already. &ldquo;Still, it is a shame
no one asked why those barges were at the docks. With their hatches
down, hiding all those Trollocs. Not that I am saying anyone knew
the Trollocs were there.&rdquo; The double loop wobbled, and he quickly
went back to a circle. Light, he was exhausted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d think one of
the High Lords would have asked, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two young men frowned thoughtfully at one
another, and Thom smiled to himself. Another seed planted, just
that easily, if clumsily as well. Another rumor started, whatever
they knew for a fact about who had charge of the docks. And rumors
spread&mdash;a rumor like this would not stop short of the city&mdash;so it was another small wedge of suspicion driven between
commoners and nobles. Who would the commoners turn to, except the
man they knew the nobles hated? The man who had saved the Stone
from Shadowspawn. Rand al&rsquo;Thor. The Lord Dragon.</p>

<p>It was time to leave what he had sown. If the roots
had taken hold here, nothing he said now could pull them loose, and
he had scattered other seeds this night. But it would not do for
anyone to discover he was the one doing the planting. &ldquo;They fought
bravely last night, the High Lords did. Why, I saw&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He
trailed off as the women leaped to their mopping and the men
grabbed up the chest and hurried away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can find work for gleemen, too,&rdquo; the majhere&rsquo;s
voice said behind him. &ldquo;Idle hands are idle hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned gracefully, considering his leg, and swept
her a deep bow. The top of her head was below his shoulder, but she
probably weighed half again what he did. She had a face like an
anvil&mdash;not improved by the bandage around her temples&mdash;an extra chin, and deep-set eyes like chips of black flint. &ldquo;A good
morning to you, gracious lady. A small token of this fresh, new
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gestured with a flurry of hands and tucked a
golden yellow sunburst blossom, only a little bedraggled for its
time up his sleeve, into the gray hair above her bandage. She
snatched the flower right out again, of course, and eyed it
suspiciously, but that was just as he wanted. He put three limping
strides into her moment of hesitation, and when she shouted
something after him, he neither listened nor slowed.</p>

<p><em>Horrible woman</em>, he thought. <em>If we had
turned her loose on the Trollocs, she&rsquo;d have had them all sweeping
and mopping</em>.</p>

<p>He yawned behind a hand, jaws creaking. He was too
old for this. He was tired, and his knee was a knot of pain. Nights
with no sleep, battles, plotting. Too old. He should be living
quietly on a farm somewhere. With chickens. Farms always had
chickens. And sheep. They must not be difficult to look after;
shepherds seemed to loll about and play the pipes all the time. He
would play the harp, of course, not pipes. Or his flute; weather
was not good for the harp. And there would be a town nearby, with
an inn where he could amaze the patrons in the common room. He
flourished his cloak as he passed two servants. The only point in
wearing it in this heat was to let people know he was a gleeman.
They perked up at the sight of him, of course, hoping he might
pause to entertain for a moment. Most gratifying. Yes, a farm had
its virtues. A quiet place. No people to bother him. As long as
there was a town close by.</p>

<p>Pushing open the door to his room, he stopped in his
tracks. Moiraine straightened as if she had a perfect right to be
going through the papers scattered on his table and calmly arranged
her skirts as she sat on the stool. Now there was a beautiful
woman, with every grace a man could want, including laughing at his
quips. <em>Fool! Old fool! She&rsquo;s Aes Sedai, and you&rsquo;re too tired to
think straight</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good morning to you, Moiraine Sedai,&rdquo; he said,
hanging his cloak on a peg. He avoided looking at his writing case,
still sitting under the table where he had left it. No point in
letting her know it was important. Probably no point in checking
after she went, for that matter; she could have channeled the lock
open and closed again, and he would never be able to tell. Weary as
he was, he could not even remember whether he had left anything
incriminating in the case. Or anywhere else, for that matter.
Everything he could see in the room was right where it belonged. He
did not think he could have been foolish enough to leave anything
out. Doors in the servants&rsquo; quarters had no locks or latches. &ldquo;I
would offer you a refreshing drink, but I fear I have nothing but
water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not thirsty,&rdquo; she said in a pleasant, melodious
voice. She leaned forward, and the room was small enough for her to
place a hand on his right knee. A chill tingle rippled through him.
&ldquo;I wish a good Healer had been near when this happened. It is too
late now, I regret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A dozen Healers would not have been enough,&rdquo; he told
her. &ldquo;A Halfman did it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>What else does she know?</em> he wondered.
Turning to pull his lone chair out from behind the table, he bit
back an oath. He felt as if he had had a good night&rsquo;s sleep, and
the pain was gone from his knee. His limp remained, but the joint
was more limber than it had been since he was injured. <em>The
woman didn&rsquo;t even ask if I wanted it. Burn me, what is she
after?</em> He refused to flex the leg. If she would not ask, he
would not acknowledge her gift.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An interesting day, yesterday,&rdquo; she said as he sat
down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d not call Trollocs and Halfmen interesting,&rdquo; he
said dryly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not mean them. Earlier. The High Lord Carleon
dead in a hunting accident. His good friend Tedosian apparently
mistook him for a boar. Or perhaps a deer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t heard.&rdquo; He kept his voice calm. Even if she
had found the note, she could not have traced it to him. Carleon
himself would have thought it by his own hand. He did not think she
could have, but he reminded himself again that she was Aes Sedai.
As if he needed any reminding, with that smooth pretty face across
from him, those serene dark eyes watching him full of all his
secrets. &ldquo;The servants&rsquo; quarters are full of gossip, but I seldom
listen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you not?&rdquo; she murmured mildly. &ldquo;Then you will not
have heard that Tedosian fell ill not an hour after returning to
the Stone, directly after his wife gave him a goblet of wine to
wash away the dust of the hunt. It is said he wept when he learned
that she means to tend him herself, and feed him with her own
hands. No doubt tears of joy at her love. I hear she has vowed not
to leave his side until he can rise again. Or until he dies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She knew. How, he could not say, but she knew. But
why was she revealing it to him? &ldquo;A tragedy,&rdquo; he said, matching her
bland tone. &ldquo;Rand will need all the loyal High Lords he can find, I
suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carleon and Tedosian were hardly loyal. Even to each
other, it seems. They led the faction that want to kill Rand and
try to forget he ever lived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you say so? I pay little attention to such
things. The works of the mighty are not for a simple gleeman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her smile was just short of laughter, but she spoke
as if reading from a page. &ldquo;Thomdril Merrilin. Called the Gray Fox,
once, by some who knew him, or knew of him. Court-bard at the Royal
Palace of Andor in Caemlyn. Morgase&rsquo;s lover for a time, after
Taringail died. Fortunate for Morgase, Taringail&rsquo;s death. I do not
suppose she ever learned he meant her to die and himself to be
Andor&rsquo;s first king. But we were speaking of Thom Merrilin, a man
who, it was said, could play the Game of Houses in his sleep. It is
a shame that such a man calls himself a simple gleeman. But such
arrogance to keep the same name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom masked his shock with an effort. How much did
she know? Too much if she knew not another word. But she was not
the only one with knowledge. &ldquo;Speaking of names,&rdquo; he said levelly,
&ldquo;it is remarkable how much can be puzzled out from a name. Moiraine
Damodred. The Lady Moiraine of House Damodred, in Cairhien.
Taringail&rsquo;s youngest half-sister. King Laman&rsquo;s niece. And Aes
Sedai, let us not forget. An Aes Sedai aiding the Dragon Reborn
since before she could have known that he was more than just
another poor fool who could channel. An Aes Sedai with connections
high in the White Tower, I would say, else she&rsquo;d not risk what she
has. Someone in the Hall of the Tower? More than one, I&rsquo;d say; it
would have to be. News of that would shake the world. But why
should there be trouble? Perhaps it&rsquo;s best to leave an old gleeman
tucked away in his hole in the servants&rsquo; quarters. Just an old
gleeman playing his harp and telling his tales. Tales that harm no
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If he had managed to stagger her even a fraction, she
did not show it. &ldquo;Speculation without facts is always dangerous,&rdquo;
she said calmly. &ldquo;I do not use my House name, by choice. House
Damodred had a deservedly unpleasant reputation before Laman cut
down <em>Avendoraldera</em> and lost the throne and his life for
it. Since the Aiel War, it has grown worse, also deservedly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Would nothing shake the woman? &ldquo;What do you want of
me?&rdquo; he demanded irritably.</p>

<p>She did not as much as blink. &ldquo;Elayne and Nynaeve
take ship for Tanchico today. A dangerous city, Tanchico. Your
knowledge and skills might keep them alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So that was it. She wanted to separate him from Rand,
leave the boy naked to her manipulations. &ldquo;As you say, Tanchico is
dangerous now, but then it always was. I wish the young women well,
yet I&rsquo;ve no wish to stick my head into a vipers&rsquo; nest. I am too old
for that sort of thing. I have been thinking of taking up farming.
A quiet life. Safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A quiet life would kill you, I think.&rdquo; Sounding
distinctly amused, she busied herself rearranging the folds of her
skirt with small, slender hands. He had the impression she was
hiding a smile. &ldquo;Tanchico will not, however. I guarantee that, and
by the First Oath, you know it for truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He frowned at her despite his best efforts to keep
his face straight. She had said it, and she could not lie, yet how
could she know? He was sure she could not Foretell; he was certain
he had heard her disavow the Talent. But she had said it. <em>Burn
the woman!</em> &ldquo;Why should I go to Tanchico?&rdquo; She could do without
titles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To protect Elayne? Morgase&rsquo;s daughter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not seen Morgase in fifteen years, Elayne was
an infant when I left Caemlyn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hesitated, but when she spoke her voice was
unrelentingly firm. &ldquo;And your reason for leaving Andor? A nephew
named Owyn, I believe. One of those poor fools you spoke of who can
channel. The Red sisters were supposed to bring him to Tar Valon,
as any such man is, but instead they gentled him on the spot and
abandoned him to the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;mercies of his neighbors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom knocked his chair over standing up, then had to
hold on to the table because his knees were shaking. Owyn had not
lived long after being gentled, driven from his home by supposed
friends who could not bear to let even a man who could no longer
channel live among them. Nothing Thom did could stop Owyn not
wanting to live, or stop his young wife from following him to the
grave inside the month.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; He cleared his throat roughly, tried to
make his voice less husky. &ldquo;Why are you telling me this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was sympathy on Moiraine&rsquo;s face. And could it
be regret? Surely not. Not from an Aes Sedai. The sympathy had to
be false as well. &ldquo;I would not have done, had you been willing to
go simply to help Elayne and Nynaeve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, burn you! Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you go with Elayne and Nynaeve, I will tell you
the names of those Red sisters when I see you next, as well as the
name of the one who gave them their orders. They did not act on
their own. And I <em>will</em> see you again. You will survive
Tarabon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew an uneven breath. &ldquo;What good will their names
do me?&rdquo; he asked in a flat voice. &ldquo;Aes Sedai names, wrapped in all
the power of the White Tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A skilled and dangerous player of the Game of Houses
might find a use for them,&rdquo; she replied quietly. &ldquo;They should not
have done what they did. They should not have been excused for
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you leave me, please?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will teach you that not all Aes Sedai are like
those Reds, Thom. You must learn that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stood leaning on the table until she was gone,
unwilling to let her see him sink awkwardly to his knees, see the
tears trickling down his weathered face. <em>Oh, Light, Owyn</em>.
He had buried it all as deeply as he could. <em>I couldn&rsquo;t get
there in time. I was too busy. Too busy with the bloody Game of
Houses</em>. He scrubbed at his face testily. Moiraine could play
the Game with the best. Wrenching him around this way, tugging
every string he had thought perfectly hidden. Owyn, Elayne.
Morgase&rsquo;s daughter. Only fondness remained for Morgase, perhaps a
little more than that, but it was hard to walk away from a child
you had bounced on your knee. <em>That girl in Tanchico? That city
would eat her alive even without a war. It must be a pit of rabid
wolves, now. And Moiraine will give me the names</em>. All he had
to do was leave Rand in Aes Sedai hands. Just as he had left Owyn.
She had him like a snake in a cleft stick, damned however he
writhed. <em>Burn the woman!</em></p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Looping the embroidery basket&rsquo;s handle over her arm,
Min gathered her skirts with her other hand and strolled out of the
dining hall after breakfast in a gliding pace, her back straight.
She could have balanced a full goblet of wine on her head without
spilling a drop. Partly that was because she could not take a
proper stride in her dress, all pale blue silk with a snug bodice
and sleeves and a full skirt that would drag its embroidered hem on
the ground if she did not hold it up. It was also partly because
she was sure she could feel Laras&rsquo;s eyes on her.</p>

<p>A glance back proved her right. The Mistress of the
Kitchens, a wine cask on legs, was beaming after her approvingly
from the dining hall doorway. Who would have thought the woman had
been a beauty in her youth, or would have a place in her heart for
pretty, flirtatious girls? &ldquo;Lively,&rdquo; she called them. Who would
have suspected she would decide to take &ldquo;Elmindreda&rdquo; under her
stout wing? It was hardly a comfortable position. Laras kept a
protective eye on Min, an eye that seemed to find her anywhere in
the Tower grounds. Min smiled back and patted her hair, now a round
black cap of curls. <em>Burn the woman! Doesn&rsquo;t she have something
to cook, or some scullion to yell at?</em></p>

<p>Laras waved to her, and she waved in return. She
could not afford to offend someone who watched her so closely, not
when she had no idea how many mistakes she might be making. Laras
knew every trick of &ldquo;lively&rdquo; women, and expected to teach Min any
she did not already know.</p>

<p>One real mistake, Min reflected as she took a seat on
a marble bench beneath a tall willow, had been the embroidery. Not
from Laras&rsquo;s point of view, but her own. Pulling her embroidery
hoop from the basket, she ruefully examined yesterday&rsquo;s work, a
number of lopsided yellow oxeyes and something she had meant to be
a pale yellow rosebud, though no one would know unless she told
them. With a sigh, she set to picking the stitches out. Leane was
right, she supposed; a woman could sit for hours with an embroidery
hoop, watching everyone and everything, and nobody thought it
strange. It would have helped, though, if she had any skill at
all.</p>

<p>At least it was a perfect morning for being
out-of-doors. A golden sun had just cleared the horizon in a sky
where the few fluffy white clouds seemed arrayed to emphasize the
perfection. A light breeze caught the scent of roses and ruffled
tall calma bushes with their big red or white blossoms. Soon enough
the gravel-covered paths near the tree would be full of people on
one errand or another, everyone from Aes Sedai to stablemen. A
perfect morning, and a perfect place from which to watch
unobserved. Perhaps today she would have a useful viewing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elmindreda?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min jumped, and stuck her pricked finger in her
mouth. Twisting &rsquo;round on the bench, she prepared to assail Gawyn
for sneaking up on her, but the words froze in her throat. Galad
was with him. Taller than Gawyn, with long legs, he moved with a
dancer&rsquo;s grace and a lean, sinewy strength. His hands were long,
too, elegant yet strong. And his face&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He was, quite simply,
the most beautiful man she had ever seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop sucking your finger,&rdquo; Gawyn said with a grin.
&ldquo;We know you are a pretty little girl; you do not need to prove it
to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blushing, she hastily pulled her hand down, and
barely restrained herself from a furious glare that would not have
been at all in keeping with Elmindreda. He had needed no threats or
commands from the Amyrlin to keep her secret, only her asking, but
he did take any opportunity to tease that presented itself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not right to mock, Gawyn,&rdquo; Galad said. &ldquo;He did
not mean to offend, Mistress Elmindreda. Your pardon, but can it be
we have met before? When you frowned at Gawyn so fiercely just
then, I almost thought I knew you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min dropped her eyes demurely. &ldquo;Oh, I could never
forget meeting <em>you</em>, my Lord Galad,&rdquo; she said in her best
foolish-girl voice. The simpering tone, and anger at her own slip,
sent a tide of heat to her hairline, improving her disguise.</p>

<p>She did not look anything like herself, and the dress
and the hair were only a part of it. Leane had acquired creams and
powders and an incredible assortment of mysterious scented things
in the city and drilled her until she could have used them in her
sleep. She had cheekbones, now, and more color in her lips than
nature had put there. A dark cream lining her eyelids and a fine
powder that emphasized her lashes made her eyes seem larger. Not at
all like herself. Some of the novices had told her admiringly how
beautiful she was, and even a few Aes Sedai had called her &ldquo;a very
pretty child.&rdquo; She hated it. The dress was quite pretty, she
admitted, but she hated the rest of it. Yet there was no point in
donning a disguise if she did not keep it up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure you would remember,&rdquo; Gawyn said dryly. &ldquo;I
did not mean to interrupt you at your embroidery&mdash;swallows,
are they? <em>Yellow</em> swallows?&rdquo; Min thrust the hoop back into
the basket. &ldquo;But I wanted to ask you to comment on this.&rdquo; He pushed
a small, leather-bound book, old and tattered, into her hands, and
suddenly his voice was serious. &ldquo;Tell my brother this is nonsense.
Perhaps he will listen to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She examined the book. <em>The Way of the Light</em>,
by Lothair Mantelar. Opening it, she read at random. &ldquo;Therefore
abjure all pleasure, for goodness is a pure abstract, a perfect
crystalline ideal which is obscured by base emotion. Pamper not the
flesh. Flesh is weak but spirit is strong; flesh is useless where
spirit is strong. Right thought is drowned in sensation, and right
action hindered by passions. Take all joy from rightness, and
rightness only.&rdquo; It seemed to be dry nonsense.</p>

<p>Min smiled at Gawyn, and even managed a titter. &ldquo;So
many words. I fear I know little of books, my Lord Gawyn. I always
mean to read one&mdash;I do.&rdquo; She sighed. &ldquo;But there is so little
time. Why, just fixing my hair properly takes hours. Do you think
it is pretty?&rdquo; The outraged startlement on his face nearly made her
laugh, but she changed it to a giggle. It was a pleasure to turn
the tables on him for a change; she would have to see if she could
do it more often. There were possibilities in this disguise she had
not considered. This stay in the Tower had turned out to be all
boredom and irritation. She deserved <em>some</em> amusement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lothair Mantelar,&rdquo; Gawyn said in a tight voice,
&ldquo;founded the Whitecloaks. The Whitecloaks!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was a great man,&rdquo; Galad said firmly. &ldquo;A
philosopher of noble ideals. If the Children of the Light have
sometimes been&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;excessive&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;since his day, it does not
change that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my. Whitecloaks,&rdquo; Min said breathlessly, and
added a little shudder. &ldquo;They are such rough men, I hear. I cannot
imagine a Whitecloak dancing. Do you think there is any chance of a
dance here? Aes Sedai do not seem to care for dancing either, and I
do so love to dance.&rdquo; The frustration in Gawyn&rsquo;s eyes was
delightful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think so,&rdquo; Galad said, taking the book from
her. &ldquo;Aes Sedai are too busy with&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;with their own affairs. If
I hear of a suitable dance in the city, I will escort you, if you
wish it. You need have no fear of being annoyed by those two
louts.&rdquo; He smiled at her, unconscious of what he was doing, and she
suddenly found herself breathless in truth. Men should not be
allowed smiles like that.</p>

<p>It actually took her a moment to remember what two
louts he was talking about. The two men who had supposedly asked
for Elmindreda&rsquo;s hand in marriage, nearly fighting each other
because she could not make up her mind, pressing her to the point
of seeking sanctuary in the Tower because she could not stop
encouraging them both. Just the entire excuse for her being there.
<em>It&rsquo;s this dress</em>, she told herself. <em>I could think
straight if I had on my proper clothes</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed the Amyrlin speaks to you every day,&rdquo;
Gawyn said suddenly. &ldquo;Has she mentioned our sister Elayne? Or
Egwene al&rsquo;Vere? Has she said anything of where they are?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min wished she could black his eye. He did not know
why she was pretending to be someone else, of course, but he had
agreed to help her be accepted as Elmindreda, and now he was
linking her to women too many in the Tower knew were friends of
Min. &ldquo;Oh, the Amyrlin Seat is such a wonderful woman,&rdquo; she said
sweetly, baring her teeth in a smile. &ldquo;She always asks how I am
passing the time, and compliments my dress. I suppose she hopes
I&rsquo;ll make a decision soon between Darvan and Goemal, but I just
cannot.&rdquo; She widened her eyes, hoping it made her look helpless and
confused. &ldquo;They are both so sweet. Who did you say? Your sister, my
Lord Gawyn? The Daughter-Heir herself? I do not think I&rsquo;ve ever
heard the Amyrlin Seat mention her. What was the other name?&rdquo; She
could hear Gawyn grinding his teeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We should not bother Mistress Elmindreda with that,&rdquo;
Galad said. &ldquo;It is our problem, Gawyn. It is up to us to find the
lie and deal with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She barely heard him, because suddenly she was
staring at a big man with long dark hair curling around slumped
shoulders, wandering aimlessly down one of the graveled paths
through the trees, under the watchful eyes of an Accepted. She had
seen Logain before, a sad-faced, once-hearty man, always with an
Accepted for companion. The woman was meant to keep him from
killing himself as much as to prevent his escape; despite his size,
he truly did not seem up to anything of the latter sort. But she
had never before seen a flaring halo around his head, radiant in
gold and blue. It was only there for a moment, but that was
enough.</p>

<p>Logain had proclaimed himself the Dragon Reborn, had
been captured and gentled. Whatever glory he might have had as a
false Dragon was far behind him now. All that remained for him was
the despair of the gentled, like a man who had been robbed of sight
and hearing and taste, wanting to die, waiting for the death that
inevitably came to such men in a few years. He glanced at her,
perhaps not seeing her; his eyes looked hopelessly inward. So why
had he worn a halo that shouted of glory and power to come? This
was something she had to tell the Amyrlin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor fellow,&rdquo; Gawyn muttered. &ldquo;I cannot help pitying
him. Light, it would be a mercy to let him end it. Why do they make
him keep on living?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He deserves no pity,&rdquo; Galad pronounced. &ldquo;Have you
forgotten what he was, what he did? How many thousands died before
he was taken? How many towns were burned? Let him live on as a
warning to others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gawyn nodded, but reluctantly. &ldquo;Yet men followed him.
Some of those towns were burned after they declared for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to go,&rdquo; Min said, getting to her feet, and
Galad was instantly all solicitude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive us, Mistress Elmindreda. We did not mean to
frighten you. Logain cannot harm you. I give you my assurance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Yes, he&rsquo;s made me feel faint. Do excuse me. I
really must go lie down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gawyn looked extremely skeptical, but he scooped up
her basket before she could touch it. &ldquo;Let me see you part of the
way, at least,&rdquo; he said, his voice oozing false concern. &ldquo;This
basket must be too heavy for you, dizzy as you are. I&rsquo;d not want
you to swoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She wanted to snatch the basket and hit him with it,
but that was not how Elmindreda would react. &ldquo;Oh, thank you, my
Lord Gawyn. You are so kind. So kind. No, no, my Lord Galad. Do not
let me encumber both of you. Do sit down here and read your book.
Do say you will. I just could not bear it, otherwise.&rdquo; She even
fluttered her eyelashes.</p>

<p>Somehow she managed to ensconce Galad on the marble
bench and get away, though with Gawyn right beside her. Her skirts
were an irritant; she wanted to pull them up to her knees and run,
but Elmindreda would never run, and never expose so much of her
legs except when dancing. Laras had lectured her severely on that
very point; one time running, and she would nearly destroy the
image of Elmindreda completely. And Gawyn&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me that basket, you muscle-brained cretin,&rdquo; she
snarled as soon as they were out of Galad&rsquo;s sight, and pulled it
away from him before he could comply. &ldquo;What do you mean by asking
me about Elayne and Egwene in front of him? Elmindreda never met
them. Elmindreda does not care about them. Elmindreda doesn&rsquo;t want
to be mentioned in the same sentence with them! Can&rsquo;t you
understand that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Not since you won&rsquo;t explain. But I am
sorry.&rdquo; There was hardly enough repentance in his voice to suit
her. &ldquo;It is just that I am worried. Where are they? This news
coming upriver about a false Dragon in Tear makes me no easier in
my mind. They are out there, somewhere, the Light knows where, and
I keep asking myself, what if they are in the middle of the sort of
bonfire Logain made out of Ghealdan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What if he isn&rsquo;t a false Dragon?&rdquo; she asked
cautiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean because the stories in the streets say he&rsquo;s
taken the Stone of Tear? Rumor has a way of magnifying events. I
will believe that when I see it, and in any case, it will take more
to convince me. Even the Stone could fall. Light, I don&rsquo;t really
believe Elayne and Egwene are in Tear, but the not knowing eats at
my belly like acid. If she is hurt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min did not know which &ldquo;she&rdquo; he meant, and suspected
he did not either. In spite of his teasing, her heart went out to
him, but there was nothing she could do. &ldquo;If you could only do as I
say and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know. Trust the Amyrlin. Trust!&rdquo; He exhaled a long
breath. &ldquo;Do you know Galad has been drinking in the taverns with
Whitecloaks? Anyone can cross the bridges if they come in peace,
even Children of the bloody Light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Galad?&rdquo; she said incredulously. &ldquo;In taverns?
Drinking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more than a cup or two, I&rsquo;m sure. He would not
unbend more than that, not for his own nameday.&rdquo; Gawyn frowned as
if unsure whether that might be a criticism of Galad. &ldquo;The point is
that he is talking with Whitecloaks. And now this book. According
to the inscription, Eamon Valda himself gave it to him. &lsquo;In the
hope you will find the way.&rsquo; Valda, Min. The man commanding the
Whitecloaks on the other side of the bridges. Not knowing is eating
Galad up, too. Listening to Whitecloaks. If anything happens to our
sister, or to Egwene&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He shook his head. &ldquo;Do you know where
they are, Min? Would you tell me if you did? Why are you
hiding?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I drove two men mad with my beauty and
cannot make up my mind,&rdquo; she told him acidly.</p>

<p>He gave a bitter half-laugh, then masked it with a
grin. &ldquo;Well, that at least I can believe.&rdquo; He chuckled, and stroked
under her chin with a finger. &ldquo;You are a very pretty girl,
Elmindreda. A pretty, clever little girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She doubled a fist and tried to punch him in the eye,
but he danced back, and she stumbled over her skirts and nearly
fell. &ldquo;You bloody ox of a thimble-brained man!&rdquo; she growled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such grace of movement, Elmindreda,&rdquo; he laughed.
&ldquo;Such a dulcet voice, as a nightingale, or a cooing dove of the
evening. What man would not grow starry-eyed at the sight of
Elmindreda?&rdquo; The mirth slid away, and he faced her soberly. &ldquo;If you
learn anything, please tell me. Please? I will beg on my knees,
Min.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell you,&rdquo; she said. <em>If I can. If it&rsquo;s
safe for them. Light, but I hate this place. Why can&rsquo;t I just go
back to Rand?</em></p>

<p>She left Gawyn there and entered the Tower proper by
herself, keeping an eye out for Aes Sedai or Accepted who might
question why she was above the ground floor and where she was
going. The news of Logain was too important to wait until the
Amyrlin encountered her, seemingly by accident, some time in the
late afternoon as usual. At least, that was what she told herself.
Impatience threatened to pop out through her skin.</p>

<p>She only saw a few Aes Sedai, turning a corner ahead
of her or entering a room in the distance, which was all to the
good. No one simply dropped in on the Amyrlin Seat. The handful of
servants she passed, all bustling about their work, did not
question her, of course, or even look at her twice except to drop
quick curtsies almost without pausing.</p>

<p>Pushing open the door to the Amyrlin&rsquo;s study, she had
a simpering tale ready in case anyone was with Leane, but the
antechamber was empty. She hurried to the inner door and put her
head in. The Amyrlin and the Keeper were seated on either side of
Siuan&rsquo;s table, which was littered with small strips of thin paper.
Their heads swiveled toward her sharply, a stare like four
nails.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; the Amyrlin snapped. &ldquo;You
are supposed to be a silly girl claiming sanctuary, not a friend of
my childhood. There is to be no contact between us except the most
casual, in passing. If necessary, I&rsquo;ll name Laras to watch over you
like a nurse over a child. She would enjoy that, I think, but I
doubt you would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min shivered at the thought. Suddenly Logain did not
seem so urgent; it was hardly likely he could achieve any glory in
the next few days. He was not really why she had come, though, only
an excuse, and she would not turn back now. Closing the door behind
her, she stammered out what she had seen and what it meant. She
still felt uncomfortable doing so in front of Leane.</p>

<p>Siuan shook her head wearily. &ldquo;Another thing to worry
about. Starvation in Cairhien. A sister missing in Tarabon. Trolloc
raids increasing in the Borderlands again. This fool who calls
himself the Prophet, stirring up riots in Ghealdan. He&rsquo;s apparently
preaching that the Dragon has been Reborn as a Shienaran lord,&rdquo; she
said incredulously. &ldquo;Even the small things are bad. The war in Arad
Doman has stopped trade from Saldaea, and the pinch is making
unrest in Maradon. Tenobia may even be forced off the throne by it.
The only good news I have heard is that the Blight has retreated
for some reason. Two miles or more of green beyond the
borderstones, without a hint of corruption or pestilence, all the
way from Saldaea to Shienar. The first time in memory it has done
that. But I suppose good news has to be balanced by bad. When a
boat has one leak it is sure to have others. I only wish it was a
balance. Leane, have the watch on Logain increased. I can&rsquo;t see
what trouble he could cause now, but I do not want to find out.&rdquo;
She turned those piercing blue eyes on Min. &ldquo;Why did you come
flapping up here with this like a startled gull? Logain could have
waited. The man is hardly likely to find power and glory before
sunset.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The near echo of her own thoughts made Min shift
uncomfortably. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said, Leane&rsquo;s eyebrows rose warningly,
and she added a hasty, &ldquo;Mother.&rdquo; The Keeper nodded approvingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That does not tell me why, child,&rdquo; Siuan said.</p>

<p>Min steeled herself. &ldquo;Mother, nothing I&rsquo;ve viewed
since the first day has been very important. I certainly have not
seen anything that points to the Black Ajah.&rdquo; That name still gave
her a chill. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you everything I know about whatever
disaster you Aes Sedai are going to face, and the rest of it is
just useless.&rdquo; She had to stop and swallow, with that penetrating
gaze on her. &ldquo;Mother, there is no reason I should not go. There&rsquo;s
reason I should. Perhaps Rand could make real use of what I can do.
If he <em>has</em> taken the Stone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Mother, he may need me.&rdquo;
<em>At least I need him, burn me for a fool!</em></p>

<p>The Keeper shuddered openly at the mention of Rand&rsquo;s
name. Siuan, on the other hand, snorted loudly. &ldquo;Your viewings have
been very useful. It&rsquo;s important to know about Logain. You found
the groom who was stealing before suspicion could land on anyone
else. And that fire-haired novice who was going to get herself with
child&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;! Sheriam cut that short&mdash;the girl won&rsquo;t even
think of men until she&rsquo;s finished her training&mdash;but we&rsquo;d not
have known until it was too late, without you. No, you cannot go.
Sooner or later your viewings will draw me a chart to the Black
Ajah, and until they do, they still more than pay their
passage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min sighed, and not only because the Amyrlin meant to
hold on to her. The last time she had seen that redheaded novice,
the girl had been sneaking off to a wooded part of the grounds with
a muscular guard. They would be married, maybe before the end of
summer; Min had known that as soon as she saw them together, though
the Tower never let a novice leave until the Tower was ready, even
one who could not go any further in her training. There was a farm
in that pair&rsquo;s future, and a swarm of children, but it was
pointless to tell the Amyrlin that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you at least let Gawyn and Galad know that
Egwene and their sister are all right, Mother?&rdquo; Asking irked her,
and her tone of voice did, too. A child denied a slice of cake
begging for a cookie instead. &ldquo;At least tell them something besides
that ridiculous tale about doing penance on a farm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have told you that is none of your concern. Do not
make me tell you again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t believe it any more than I do,&rdquo; Min got
out before the Amyrlin&rsquo;s dry smile quieted her. It was not an
amused smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you suggest I change where they are supposed to
be? After letting everyone think them on a farm? Do you suppose
that might raise a few eyebrows? Everyone but those boys accepts
it. And you. Well, Coulin Gaidin will just have to work them that
much harder. Sore muscles and enough sweat will take most men&rsquo;s
minds off other troubles. Women&rsquo;s minds too. You ask many more
questions, and I&rsquo;ll see what a few days scrubbing pots will do for
you. Better to lose your services for two or three days than have
you poking your nose where it does not belong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even know if they are in trouble, do you?
Or Moiraine.&rdquo; It was not Moiraine she meant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Girl,&rdquo; Leane said warningly, but Min was not to be
stopped now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t we heard? Rumors reached here two days
ago. Two days! Why doesn&rsquo;t one of those slips on your desk contain
a message from her? Doesn&rsquo;t she have pigeons? I thought you Aes
Sedai had people with messenger pigeons everywhere. If there isn&rsquo;t
one in Tear, there should be. A man on horseback could have reached
Tar Valon before now. Why&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The flat crack of Siuan&rsquo;s palm on the table cut her
off. &ldquo;You obey remarkably well,&rdquo; she said wryly. &ldquo;Child, until we
hear something to the contrary, assume the young man is well. Pray
that he is.&rdquo; Leane shivered again. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a saying in the Maule,
child,&rdquo; the Amyrlin went on. &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;Do not trouble trouble till trouble
troubles you.&rsquo; Mark it well, child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a timid knock at the door.</p>

<p>The Amyrlin and the Keeper exchanged glances; then
two sets of eyes shifted to Min. Her presence was a problem. There
was certainly nowhere to hide; even the balcony was clearly visible
from the room in its entirety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A reason for you to be here,&rdquo; Siuan muttered, &ldquo;that
doesn&rsquo;t make you any more than the fool girl you&rsquo;re supposed to be.
Leane, stand ready at the door.&rdquo; She and the Keeper were on their
feet together, Siuan coming around the table while Leane moved to
the door. &ldquo;Take Leane&rsquo;s seat, girl. Move your feet, child; move
your feet. Now look sulky. Not angry, sulky! Stick your lower lip
out and stare at the floor. I may make you wear ribbons in your
hair, huge red bows. That&rsquo;s it. Leane.&rdquo; The Amyrlin put her fists
on her hips and raised her voice. &ldquo;And if you ever walk in on me
unannounced again, child, I will&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leane pulled the door open to reveal a dark novice
who flinched at Siuan&rsquo;s continuing tirade, then dropped a deep
curtsy. &ldquo;Messages for the Amyrlin, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; the girl squeaked.
&ldquo;Two pigeons arrived at the loft.&rdquo; She was one of those who had
told Min she was beautiful, and she tried to stare past the Keeper
with wide eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This does not concern you, child,&rdquo; Leane said
briskly, taking the tiny cylinders of bone out of the girl&rsquo;s hand.
&ldquo;Back to the loft with you.&rdquo; Before the novice finished rising,
Leane shut the door, then leaned against it with a sigh. &ldquo;I have
jumped at every unexpected sound since you told me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;
Straightening, she came back to the table. &ldquo;Two more messages,
Mother. Shall I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Open them,&rdquo; the Amyrlin said. &ldquo;No doubt Morgase
has decided to invade Cairhien after all. Or Trollocs have overrun
the Borderlands. It would be of a piece with everything else.&rdquo; Min
kept her seat; Siuan had sounded all too realistic with some of
those threats.</p>

<p>Leane examined the red wax seal on the end of one of
the small cylinders, no larger than her own finger joint, then
broke it open with a thumbnail when she was satisfied it had not
been tampered with. The rolled paper inside she extracted with a
slim ivory pick. &ldquo;Nearly as bad as Trollocs, Mother,&rdquo; she said
almost as soon as she began reading. &ldquo;Mazrim Taim has escaped.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light!&rdquo; Siuan barked. &ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This only says he was taken away by stealth in the
night, Mother. Two sisters are dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light illumine their souls. But we&rsquo;ve little
time to mourn the dead while the likes of Taim are alive and
ungentled. Where, Leane?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Denhuir, Mother. A village east of the Black Hills
on the Maradon Road, above the headwaters of the Antaeo and the
Luan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It had to be some of his followers. Fools. Why won&rsquo;t
they know when they are beaten? Choose out a dozen reliable
sisters, Leane&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; The Amyrlin grimaced. &ldquo;Reliable,&rdquo; she
muttered. &ldquo;If I knew who was more reliable than a silverpike, I&rsquo;d
not have the problems I do. Do the best you can, Leane. A dozen
sisters. And five hundred of the guards. No, a full thousand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; the Keeper said worriedly. &ldquo;The Whitecloaks&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;would not try to cross the bridges if I left
them unwatched entirely. They would be afraid of a trap. There is
no telling what is going on up there, Leane. I want whoever I send
to be ready for anything. And Leane&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Mazrim Taim is to be
gentled as soon as he is taken again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leane&rsquo;s eyes opened wide with shock. &ldquo;The law.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know the law as well as you, but I will not risk
having him freed again ungentled. I&rsquo;ll not risk another Guaire
Amalasan, not on top of every thing else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mother,&rdquo; Leane said faintly.</p>

<p>The Amyrlin picked up the second bone cylinder and
snapped it in two with a sharp crack to get the message out. &ldquo;Good
news at last,&rdquo; she breathed, a smile blooming on her face. &ldquo;Good
news. &lsquo;The sling has been used. The shepherd holds the sword.&rsquo;
&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand?&rdquo; Min asked, and Siuan nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, girl. The Stone has fallen. Rand al&rsquo;Thor,
the shepherd, has <em>Callandor</em>. Now I can move. Leane, I want
the Hall of the Tower convened this afternoon. No, this
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; Min said. &ldquo;You knew the rumors
were about Rand. Why are you calling the Hall now? What can you do
that you could not before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Siuan laughed like a girl. &ldquo;What I can do now is tell
them right out that I have received word from an Aes Sedai that the
Stone of Tear has fallen and a man has drawn <em>Callandor</em>.
Prophecy fulfilled. Enough of it for my purpose, at least. The
Dragon is Reborn. They&rsquo;ll flinch, they&rsquo;ll argue, but none can
oppose my pronouncement that the Tower must guide this man. At last
I can involve myself with him openly. Openly for the most
part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we doing the right thing, Mother?&rdquo; Leane said
abruptly. &ldquo;I know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;If he has <em>Callandor</em>, he must be
the Dragon Reborn, but he can channel, Mother. A man who can
channel. I only saw him once, but even then there was something
strange about him. Something more than being <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>.
Mother, is he so very different from Taim when it comes down to
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The difference is that he <em>is</em> the Dragon
Reborn, daughter,&rdquo; the Amyrlin said quietly. &ldquo;Taim is a wolf, and
maybe rabid. Rand al&rsquo;Thor is the wolfhound we will use to defeat
the Shadow. Keep his name to yourself, Leane. Best not to reveal
too much too soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you say, Mother,&rdquo; the Keeper said, but she still
sounded uneasy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Off with you now. I want the Hall assembled in an
hour.&rdquo; Siuan thoughtfully watched the taller woman go. &ldquo;There may
be more resistance than I would wish,&rdquo; she said when the door
clicked shut.</p>

<p>Min looked at her sharply. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing serious, child. Not as long as they
don&rsquo;t know how long I have been involved with the al&rsquo;Thor boy.&rdquo; She
looked at the slip of paper again, then dropped it onto the table.
&ldquo;I could wish Moiraine had told me more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t she say more? And why have we not heard
from her before this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More questions with you. That one you must ask
Moiraine. She has always gone her own way. Ask Moiraine,
child.&rdquo;</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Sahra Covenry worked the hoe in desultory fashion,
frowning at the tiny sprouts of threadleaf and hensfoot poking up
in the rows of cabbages and beets. It was not that Mistress Elward
was a harsh taskmistress&mdash;she was no more stern than Sahra&rsquo;s
mother, and certainly easier that Sheriam&mdash;but Sahra had not
gone to the White Tower to end up back on a farm hoeing vegetables
with the sun barely up. Her white novice dresses were packed away;
she wore brown wool her mother might have sewn, the skirt tied up
to her knees to keep it out of the dirt. It was all so unfair. She
had not done anything.</p>

<p>Wriggling her bare toes in the turned soil, she
glared at a stubborn hensfoot and channeled, meaning to burn it out
of the ground. Sparks flashed around the leafy sprout, and it
wilted. Hurriedly she sliced the thing out of the dirt and her
mind. If there was any fairness in the world, Lord Galad would come
to the farm while out hunting.</p>

<p>Leaning on the hoe, she lost herself in a daydream of
Healing Galad&rsquo;s injuries, received in a fall from his horse&mdash;not his fault, of course; he was a wonderful horseman&mdash;and
him lifting her up in front of him on his saddle, declaring he
would be her Warder&mdash;she would be Green Ajah, of course&mdash;and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sahra Covenry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sahra jumped at the sharp voice, but it was not
Mistress Elward. She curtsied as best she could, with her skirts
gathered up. &ldquo;The day&rsquo;s greeting, Aes Sedai. Have you come to take
me back to the Tower?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai moved closer, not caring that her
skirts dragged through the dirt of the vegetable patch. Despite the
summer warmth of the morning, she wore a cloak, the hood pulled up
to shadow her face. &ldquo;Just before you left the Tower, you took a
woman to the Amyrlin Seat. A woman calling herself Elmindreda.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Sahra said, a slight question in
her voice. She did not like the way the Aes Sedai had said that, as
if she had left the Tower for good.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me everything that you heard or saw, girl, from
the moment you took the woman in charge. Everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I heard nothing, Aes Sedai. The Keeper sent me
away as soon as&mdash;&rdquo; Pain racked her, digging her toes into the
dirt, arching her back; the spasm lasted only moments, but it
seemed eternal. Struggling for breath, she realized her cheek was
pressed to the ground, and her still trembling fingers dug into the
soil. She did not remember falling. She could see Mistress Elward&rsquo;s
laundry basket lying on its side near the stone farmhouse, damp
linens spilled out in a heap. Dazed, she thought that that was odd;
Moria Elward would never leave her washing lying like that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything, girl,&rdquo; the Aes Sedai said coldly. She
was standing over Sahra now, making no move to help her. She had
hurt her; it was not supposed to be that way. &ldquo;Every person this
Elmindreda spoke to, every word she said, every nuance and
expression.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She spoke to Lord Gawyn, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Sahra sobbed
into the earth. &ldquo;That is all I know, Aes Sedai. All.&rdquo; She began to
weep in earnest, sure that was not enough to satisfy this woman.
She was right. She did not stop screaming for a long time, and when
the Aes Sedai left there was not a sound around the farmhouse
except for the chickens, not even breathing.</p>
