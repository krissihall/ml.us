<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">F</span>or
a moment Nynaeve stood in the Heart of the Stone
not seeing it, not thinking of <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> at all.
Egeanin was Seanchan. One of those vile people who had put a collar
on Egwene&rsquo;s neck and tried to put one on hers. Knowing it still
made her feel hollow. Seanchan, and she had snaked her way into
Nynaeve&rsquo;s affections. True friends had seemed so few and far
between since leaving Emond&rsquo;s Field. To find a new one, then lose
her in this way&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hate her for that worst of all,&rdquo; she growled,
folding her arms tightly. &ldquo;She made me like her, and I cannot stop,
and I hate her for it!&rdquo; Said aloud, it made no sense at all. &ldquo;I do
not have to make sense.&rdquo; She laughed quietly, with a rueful shake
of her head. &ldquo;I am supposed to be Aes Sedai.&rdquo; But not to be
wool-gathering like a fool girl.</p>

<p><em>Callandor</em> sparkled, the crystal sword rising
out of the floor-stones beneath the great dome, and the massive
redstone columns ran off in shadowed rows through that odd, dim
light that came from everywhere. Easy to remember the feel of being
watched, to imagine it again. If it had been imagination before. If
it was now. Anything might be hiding back in there. A good stout
stick appeared in her hands as she peered among the columns. Where
was Egwene? Just like the girl to keep her waiting. All that
murkiness. For all she knew, something could be about to jump out
at&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is an odd dress, Nynaeve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just stifling a yelp, she spun around heavily,
rattling metallically, heart thumping in her throat. Egwene stood
on the other side of <em>Callandor</em> with two women in bulky
skirts and dark shawls over white blouses, snowy hair held by
folded scarves falling to their waists. Nynaeve swallowed, hoping
none of them noticed, tried to make herself breathe normally again.
Sneaking up on her that way!</p>

<p>One of the Aiel women she knew from Elayne&rsquo;s
description; Amys&rsquo;s face was much too young for such hair, but
apparently it had been almost silver even as a child. The other,
thin and bony, had pale blue eyes in a leathery, wrinkled face.
That must be Bair. The tougher of the two, in Nynaeve&rsquo;s opinion now
that she saw them, not that this Amys looked very&mdash;Odd dress?
<em>I rattled?</em></p>

<p>Staring down at herself, she gasped. Her dress looked
vaguely like a Two Rivers garment; if Two Rivers women wore dresses
fashioned from steel mail, with pieces of plate armor like those
she had seen in Shienar. How did men run about and jump into
saddles in these things? It dragged at her shoulders as if it
weighed a hundred pounds. The good stick was metal now, and spiked
at the end like a shiny steel sandburr. Without touching her head
she knew she had on some sort of helmet. Blushing furiously, she
concentrated, changed it all to good Two Rivers woolens and a
walking staff. It felt good to have her hair back in one proper
braid, hanging over her shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncontrolled thoughts are troublesome when you walk
the dream,&rdquo; Bair said in a thin, strong voice. &ldquo;You must learn to
control them if you mean to continue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can control my thoughts very well, thank you,&rdquo;
Nynaeve said crisply. &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; Bair&rsquo;s voice was not all that was
thin. The Two Wise Ones seemed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;misty, almost, and Egwene, in
a pale blue riding dress, was very nearly transparent. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
matter with you? Why do you look that way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You try entering <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> while
half-asleep in a saddle,&rdquo; Egwene said dryly. She seemed to flicker.
&ldquo;It is morning in the Three-fold Land, and we are on the move. I
had to talk Amys into letting me come at all, but I was afraid you
would be worried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a difficult enough task without the horse,&rdquo;
Amys said, &ldquo;sleeping shallowly when you wish to be awake. Egwene
has not learned it entirely yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; Egwene said with an irritated
determination. She was always too hasty and stubborn in her desire
to learn; if these Wise Ones did not hold on to the scruff of her
neck she would very likely jump into all sorts of trouble.</p>

<p>Nynaeve stopped worrying about Egwene and trouble as
the younger woman began to speak of Trollocs and Draghkar attacking
Cold Rocks Hold. Seana, a Wise One dreamwalker, among the dead.
Rand hurrying the Taardad Aiel toward this Alcair Dal, apparently
in violation of all custom, sending out runners to bring more
septs. The boy was confiding his intentions to no one, the Aiel
were jumpy, and Moiraine was ready to bite the heads off nails.
Moiraine&rsquo;s frustration would have been some relief&mdash;she had
hoped he could escape that woman&rsquo;s influence somehow&mdash;if
Egwene had not frowned so worriedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether it is madness or design,&rdquo;
Egwene finished. &ldquo;I could almost bear it either way if I knew.
Nynaeve, I&rsquo;ll admit it isn&rsquo;t prophecy, or Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don, that
makes me anxious right now. Maybe it is foolish, but I promised
Elayne to look after him, and I do not know how.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve walked around the crystal sword to put an arm
around her. At least she felt solid, even if she did look a
reflection in a foggy mirror. Rand&rsquo;s sanity. There was nothing she
could do about that, no comfort she could offer. Egwene was the one
there to see him. &ldquo;The best you can do for Elayne is to tell him to
read what she wrote. She worries about it sometimes; she won&rsquo;t
talk, but I think she&rsquo;s afraid she said more than she should have.
If he believes she is totally besotted, he&rsquo;s more likely to feel
the same, which will not hurt her in the least. At least we have
some good news in Tanchico. Some.&rdquo; When she explained, though, it
barely seemed to justify &ldquo;some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you still don&rsquo;t know what it is they&rsquo;re after,&rdquo;
Egwene said after she finished, &ldquo;but even if you did, they are on
top of it and still might find it first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not if I can help it.&rdquo; Nynaeve fixed the two Wise
Ones with a firm, level look. From what Elayne said of Amys&rsquo;s
reluctance to give anything but warnings, she would need firmness
to deal with them. The pair was so hazy a strong puff might blow
them away like fog. &ldquo;Elayne thinks you know all sorts of tricks
with dreams. Is there any way I could get into Amathera&rsquo;s dreams to
see if she is a Darkfriend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Foolish girl.&rdquo; Bair&rsquo;s long hair swung as she shook
her head. &ldquo;If Aes Sedai, a foolish girl still. To step into
another&rsquo;s dream is very dangerous unless she knows you and expects
you. It is <em>her</em> dream, not as here. There, this Amathera
will control all. Even you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had been sure that was the way. It was irritating
to learn differently. And &ldquo;foolish girl&rdquo;?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not a girl,&rdquo; she snapped. She wanted to yank
her braid, but clenched a fist at her side instead; for some
reason, pulling at her hair felt strangely uncomfortable of late.
&ldquo;I was Wisdom of Emond&rsquo;s Field before I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;became Aes Sedai&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She hardly stumbled over the lie at all now. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and I told
women as old as you when to sit down and be quiet. If you know how
to help me, say so instead of giving me <em>foolish</em>
maunderings about what is dangerous. I know danger when I see
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly she realized her single braid had split in
two, one over each ear, red ribbons woven through to make tassels
on the ends. Her skirt was so short it showed her knees, she wore a
loose white blouse like the Wise Ones, and her shoes and stockings
were gone. Where had <em>this</em> come from? She had surely never
thought of wearing anything like it. Egwene put a hasty hand over
her mouth. Was she aghast? Surely not smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncontrolled thoughts,&rdquo; Amys said, &ldquo;can be very
troublesome indeed, Nynaeve Sedai, until you learn.&rdquo; Despite her
bland tone, her lips quirked in barely masked amusement.</p>

<p>Nynaeve kept her face smooth with an effort. They
could not have had anything to do with it. <em>They can&rsquo;t
have!</em> She struggled to change back, and it <em>was</em> a
struggle, as though something held her as she was. Her cheeks grew
hotter and hotter. Suddenly, just at the point when she was ready
to break down and ask advice, or even help, her clothes and hair
were as they had been. She wriggled her toes gratefully in good
stout shoes. It <em>had</em> just been some odd, stray thought. In
any case, she was not about to voice any suspicions; they looked
far too amused as it was, even Egwene. <em>I am not here for some
fool contest. I just won&rsquo;t dignify them</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I cannot enter her dream, can I bring her into
the World of Dreams? I need some way to talk to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We would not teach you that if we knew how,&rdquo; Amys
said, hitching her shawl angrily. &ldquo;It is an evil thing you ask,
Nynaeve Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She would be as helpless here as you in her dream.&rdquo;
Bair&rsquo;s thin voice sounded like an iron rod. &ldquo;It has been handed
down among dreamwalkers since the first that no one must ever be
<em>brought</em> into the dream. It is said that that was the way
of the Shadow in the last days of the Age of Legends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve shifted her feet under those hard stares;
realizing she had an arm around Egwene, she held still. She was not
about to let Egwene think they had made her uneasy. Not that they
had. If she thought of being hauled before the Women&rsquo;s Circle
before she was chosen Wisdom, it was nothing at all to do with the
Wise Ones. Firmness was what was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;They stared at her. Hazy or
not, these women could duel Siuan Sanche stare for stare.
Especially Bair. Not that they intimidated her, but she could see
the point of being reasonable. &ldquo;Elayne and I need help. The Black
Ajah is sitting on top of something that can harm Rand. If they
find it before we do, they may be able to control him. We need to
find it first. If there is anything you can do to help, anything
you can tell me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Anything at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Amys said, &ldquo;you can make a request for
help sound a demand.&rdquo; Nynaeve&rsquo;s mouth tightened&mdash;demand? She
had all but begged. Demand, indeed!&mdash;but the Aiel woman did
not seem to notice. Or chose to ignore it. &ldquo;Yet a danger to Rand
al&rsquo;Thor&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;We cannot allow the Shadow to have that. There is a
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dangerous.&rdquo; Bair shook her head vigorously. &ldquo;This
young woman knows less than Egwene did when she came to us. It is
too dangerous for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then maybe I could&mdash;&rdquo; Egwene began, and the two
cut her off as one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are going to complete your training; you are too
eager to go beyond what you know,&rdquo; Bair said sharply at the same
time Amys said, not the slightest bit softer, &ldquo;You are not there in
Tanchico, you do not know the place, and you cannot have Nynaeve&rsquo;s
need. She is the hunter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Under those iron eyes, Egwene subsided sulkily, and
the two Wise Ones looked at each other. Finally Bair shrugged and
lifted her shawl up around her face; clearly she washed her hands
of the entire matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is dangerous,&rdquo; Amys said. They made it sound as
if breathing was dangerous in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;!&rdquo; Nynaeve cut off as Amys&rsquo;s eyes actually
grew harder; she would not have thought it possible. Keeping a firm
image of her clothes as they were&mdash;of course they had had
nothing to do with that; it simply seemed wise to make sure her
dress remained as it was&mdash;she changed what she had been going
to say. &ldquo;I will be careful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not possible,&rdquo; Amys told her flatly, &ldquo;but I do
not know another way. Need is the key. When there are too many
people for the hold, the sept must divide, and the need is for
water at the new hold. If no location with water is known, one of
us may be called to find one. The key then is the need for a proper
valley or canyon, not too far from the first, with water.
Concentrating on that need will bring you near to what you want.
Concentrating on the need again will bring you closer. Each step
brings you nearer, until at last you are not only in the valley,
but standing beside where water is to be found. It may be harder
for you, because you do not know exactly what you are seeking,
though the depth of need may make up for it. And you know already
in a rough fashion where it lies, in this palace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The danger is this, and you must be aware of it.&rdquo;
The Wise One leaned toward her intently, driving her words home
with a tone as sharp as her gaze. &ldquo;Each step is made blind, with
eyes closed. You cannot know where you will be when you open your
eyes. And finding the water does no good if you are standing in a
den of vipers. The fangs of a mountain king kill as quickly in the
dream as waking. I think these women Egwene speaks of will kill
more quickly than the snake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did that,&rdquo; Egwene exclaimed. Nynaeve felt her jump
as the Aiel women&rsquo;s eyes went to her. &ldquo;Before I met you,&rdquo; she said
hastily. &ldquo;Before we went to Tear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Need. Nynaeve felt warmer toward the Aiel women now
that one of them had given her something she could use. &ldquo;You must
keep a close eye on Egwene,&rdquo; she told them, hugging the younger
woman to show she meant it fondly. &ldquo;You are right, Bair. She will
try to do more than she knows how. She has always been that way.&rdquo;
For some reason Bair arched a white eyebrow at <em>her</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not find her so,&rdquo; Amys said in a dry voice.
&ldquo;She is a biddable student, now. Is that not so, Egwene?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene&rsquo;s mouth set in a stubborn line. These Wise
Ones did not know her well if they believed a Two Rivers woman
would call herself biddable. On the other hand, she did not say
anything. That was unexpected. As hard a lot as Aes Sedai, it
appeared, these Aiel women.</p>

<p>Her hour was slipping away, and impatience bubbled to
try this method now; if Elayne woke her, it might take hours to get
back to sleep. &ldquo;In seven days,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;one of us will meet you
here again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene nodded. &ldquo;In seven days, Rand will have shown
himself to the clan chiefs as He Who Comes With the Dawn, and the
Aiel will all be behind him.&rdquo; The Wise Ones&rsquo; eyes shifted slightly,
and Amys adjusted her shawl; Egwene did not see it. &ldquo;The Light
knows what he means to do then,&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In seven days,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, &ldquo;Elayne and I will
have taken whatever Liandrin is hunting away from the lot of them.&rdquo;
Or else, very likely, the Black Ajah would have it. So the Wise
Ones were not more certain the Aiel would follow Rand than Egwene
was of his plans. No certainty anywhere. But no point in burdening
Egwene with more doubts, either. &ldquo;When one of us sees you next,
we&rsquo;ll have laid them by the heels and stuffed them all in sacks to
cart to the Tower for trial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try to be careful, Nynaeve. I know you don&rsquo;t know
how to, but try anyway. Tell Elayne I said so, too. She isn&rsquo;t as&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;bold&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;as you are, but she can come close.&rdquo; Amys and Bair
each laid a hand on Egwene&rsquo;s shoulder, and they were gone. Try to
be careful? Fool girl. She was always careful. What had Egwene been
about to say rather than bold? Nynaeve folded her arms tightly in
lieu of pulling her braid. Maybe better she did not know.</p>

<p>She realized she had not told Egwene about Egeanin.
Perhaps best not to stir up Egwene&rsquo;s memories of her captivity.
Nynaeve could remember all too well the other woman&rsquo;s nightmares
for weeks after she was freed, waking up screaming that she would
not be chained. Much the best to let it lie. It was not as if
Egwene need ever meet the Seanchan woman. <em>Burn that woman! Burn
Egeanin to ash! Burn her!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;This is not using my time wisely,&rdquo; she said aloud.
The words echoed through the tall columns. With the other women
gone, they looked even more foreboding than before, more a hiding
place for unseen watchers and things that jumped out at you. Time
to be away.</p>

<p>First, though, she changed her hair to a tassel of
long narrow braids, her dress to clinging folds of dark green silk.
A transparent veil covered her mouth and nose, fluttering slightly
when she breathed. With a grimace she added beads of green jade
woven into the thin plaits. Should any of the Black sisters be
using their stolen <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> to enter the World of
Dreams and see her in the Panarch&rsquo;s Palace, they would think her
only a Taraboner woman who had dreamed herself there in more
ordinary fashion. Some knew her by sight, though. Lifting a handful
of bead-strung braids, she smiled. Pale honey. She had not realized
that was possible. <em>I wonder what I look like. Could they still
know me?</em></p>

<p>Suddenly a tall stand-mirror stood beside <em>
Callandor</em>, In the glass, her big brown eyes widened in shock,
her rosebud of a mouth fell open. She had Rendra&rsquo;s face! Her
features flickered back and forth, eyes and hair flashing darker
then lighter; straining, she settled them as the innkeeper&rsquo;s. No
one would know her now. And Egwene thought she did not know how to
be careful.</p>

<p>Closing her eyes, she concentrated on Tanchico, on
the Panarch&rsquo;s Palace, on need. Something dangerous to Rand, to the
Dragon Reborn, need&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Around her, <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>
shifted; <em>she felt</em> it, a sliding lurch, and opened her eyes
eagerly to see what she had found.</p>

<p>It was a bedchamber, as big as any six at the Three
Plum Court, the white plaster walls worked in painted friezes,
golden lamps hanging from the ceiling by gilded chains. The tall
posts of the bed spread carved limbs and leaves in a canopy above
the mattresses. A woman well short of her middle years stood
stiffly with her back to one of the posts at the foot of the bed;
she was really quite lovely, in that pouty-mouthed way that Nynaeve
herself had adopted. Atop her dark braids sat a crown of golden
trefoil leaves among rubies and pearls with a moonstone larger than
a goose egg, and around her neck hung a broad stole, dangling to
her knees and embroidered along its length with trees. Aside from
crown and stole she wore only a glistening coat of sweat.</p>

<p>Her tremulous eyes were fixed on the woman lying at
her ease on a low couch. The second woman&rsquo;s back was to Nynaeve, as
misty as Egwene had been earlier. She was short and slight, dark
hair flowing loose to her shoulders, wide-skirted gown of pale
yellow silk definitely not Taraboner. Nynaeve did not have to see
her face to know it had large blue eyes and a foxlike shape, or see
the bonds of Air holding the woman against the bedpost to know she
was looking at Temaile Kinderode.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;learn so much when you use your dreams instead
of wasting sleep,&rdquo; Temaile was saying with a Cairhienin accent,
laughing. &ldquo;Are you not enjoying yourself? What shall I teach you
next? I know. &lsquo;I Have Loved a Thousand Sailor Men.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; She waggled
an admonishing finger. &ldquo;Be sure you learn all the words properly,
Amathera. You know I would not want to&mdash;What are you gaping
at?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly Nynaeve realized the woman against the
bedpost&mdash;Amathera? The Panarch?&mdash;was staring straight
at her. Temaile shifted lazily as though to turn her head.</p>

<p>Nynaeve clamped her eyes shut. Need.</p>

<p><em>Shift</em>.</p>

<p>Letting herself sag against the narrow column,
Nynaeve gulped air as if she had run twenty miles, not even
wondering where she was. Her heart pounded like a wild drum. Speak
of landing in a vipers&rsquo; den. Temaile Kinderode. The Black sister
Amico had said enjoyed causing pain, enjoyed it enough to have made
one of the Black Ajah comment. And her not able to channel a spark.
She could have ended up decorating a bedpost beside Amathera. <em>
Light</em>! She shivered, seeing it. <em>Calm yourself, woman! You
are out of there, and even if Temaile saw you, she saw a
honey-haired woman who vanished, just a Taraboner who dreamed
herself into</em> Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod <em>for a moment</em>. Surely
Temaile could not have been aware of her long enough to sense she
could channel; even when she could not do it, the ability was there
to be felt by one who shared it. Only a moment. Not long enough,
with luck.</p>

<p>At least she knew Amathera&rsquo;s situation now. The woman
was certainly no ally of Temaile. This method of searching had
already repaid use. But not enough, not yet. Controlling her
breathing as best she could, she looked around.</p>

<p>Rows of the thin white columns ran the length and
breadth of a huge chamber nearly as wide as it was long, with
smooth polished white floorstones below and gilded bosses on the
ceiling high above. A thick rope of white silk ran all the way
around the room on waist-high posts of dark polished wood, except
where it would have blocked the doorways with double-pointed
arches. Stands and open cabinets lined the walls, and the bones of
peculiar beasts, with more display cases out in the floor, also
roped off. The main exhibition hall of the palace, from Egwene&rsquo;s
description. What she sought must be in this very chamber. Her next
step would not be as blind as the first; there were certainly no
vipers, no Temaile, here.</p>

<p>A handsome woman suddenly appeared beside a glass
case with four carved legs out in the middle of the floor. She was
no Taraboner, with her dark hair falling in waves to her shoulders,
yet that was not what made Nynaeve gape. The woman&rsquo;s dress seemed
to be mist, sometimes silvery and opaque, sometimes gray and so
thin as to show her limbs and body clearly. From wherever she had
dreamed herself here, she assuredly had a vivid imagination to
conceive that! Even the scandalous Domani dresses she had heard of
surely could not equal this.</p>

<p>The woman smiled at the glass case, then continued on
up the hall, stopping on the far side to study something Nynaeve
could not make out, something dark atop a white stone stand.</p>

<p>Frowning, Nynaeve released her grip on a fistful of
honey-colored braids. The woman would disappear at any moment; few
dreamed themselves into <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> for long. Of
course, it did not matter if the woman saw her; she was certainly
no one on their list of Black sisters. And yet she seemed somehow&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Nynaeve realized she had taken hold of a handful of braids
again. The woman&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Of its own accord her hand pulled&mdash;hard&mdash;and she stared at it in amazement; her knuckles were
white, her hand quivering. It was almost as if thinking of that
woman&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Arm shaking, her hand tried to yank her hair out of her
scalp. <em>Why under the Light?</em></p>

<p>The mist-clad woman still stood in front of the
distant white pedestal. Trembling spread from Nynaeve&rsquo;s arm into
her shoulder. She had certainly never seen the woman before. And
yet&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She tried to open her fingers; they only clamped down
harder. Surely she never had. Shivering from head to toe, she
hugged herself with the one arm she had free. Surely&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Her
teeth wanted to chatter. The woman seemed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She wanted to weep.
The woman&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Images burst into her head, exploding; she slumped
against the column beside her as if they had physical force; her
eyes bulged. She saw it again. The Chamber of Falling Blossoms, and
that sturdily handsome woman surrounded by the glow of <em>
saidar</em>. Herself and Elayne, babbling like children, fighting
to be first to answer, pouring out everything they knew. How much
had they told? It was difficult to bring out details, but she dimly
remembered keeping some things back. Not because she wanted to; she
would have told the woman anything, done anything she asked. Her
face heated with shame, and anger. If she had managed to hide any
scraps, it was only because she had been so&mdash;<em>eager!</em>&mdash;to answer the last question asked that she passed over
earlier.</p>

<p><em>It makes no sense</em>, a small voice said in the
back of her head. <em>If she&rsquo;s a Black sister I don&rsquo;t know about,
why did she not hand us over to Liandrin? She could have. We&rsquo;d have
gone with her like lambs</em>.</p>

<p>Cold rage would not let her listen. A Black sister
had made her dance like a puppet and then told her to forget.
Ordered her to forget: And she had! Well, now the woman would find
out what it was like to face her ready and forewarned!</p>

<p>Before she could reach for the True Source, Birgitte
was suddenly beside the next column in that short white coat and
wide yellow trousers gathered at the ankle. Birgitte, or some woman
dreaming she was Birgitte, with golden hair in an elaborate braid.
A warning finger pressed against her lips, she pointed at Nynaeve,
then urgently toward one of the double-arched doorways behind them.
Bright blue eyes compelling, she vanished.</p>

<p>Nynaeve shook her head. Whoever the woman was, she
had no time. Opening herself to <em>saidar</em>, she turned, filled
to overflowing with the One Power and righteous wrath. The woman
clothed in mist was gone. Gone! Because that golden-haired fool had
distracted her! Perhaps that one was still about, waiting for her.
Wrapped in the Power, she strode through the doorway the woman had
indicated.</p>

<p>The golden-haired woman was waiting in a brightly
carpeted hallway where unlit golden lamps gave off the scent of
perfumed oil. She held a silver bow now, and a quiver of silver
arrows hung at her waist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Nynaeve demanded furiously. She would
give the woman a chance to explain herself. And then teach her a
lesson she would not soon forget! &ldquo;Are you the same fool who shot
at me in the Waste, claiming she was Birgitte? I was about to teach
a member of the Black Ajah manners when you let her get away!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Birgitte,&rdquo; the woman said, leaning on her bow.
&ldquo;At least, that is the name you would know. And the lesson might
have been yours, here as surely as in the Three-fold Land. I
remember the lives I have lived as if they were books well-read,
the longer gone dimmer than the nearer, but I remember well when I
fought at Lews Therin&rsquo;s side. I will never forget Moghedien&rsquo;s face,
any more than I will forget the face of Asmodean, the man you
almost disturbed at Rhuidean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Asmodean? Moghedien? That woman was one of the
Forsaken? A Forsaken in Tanchico. And one at Rhuidean, in the
Waste! Egwene would certainly have said something if she knew. No
way to warn her, not for seven days. Anger&mdash;and <em>
saidar</em>&mdash;surged in her. &ldquo;What are you doing here? I know
that you all vanished after the Horn of Valere called you,
but you are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She trailed off, a trifle flustered at what she
had been about to say, but the other woman calmly finished for
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dead? Those of us who are bound to the Wheel are not
dead as others are dead. Where better for us to wait until the
Wheel weaves us out in new lives than in the World of Dreams?&rdquo;
Birgitte laughed suddenly. &ldquo;I begin to talk as if I were a
philosopher. In almost every life I can remember I was born a
simple girl who took up the bow. I am an archer, no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the heroine of a hundred tales,&rdquo; Nynaeve
said. &ldquo;And I saw what your arrows did at Falme. Seanchan channeling
did not touch you. Birgitte, we face near a dozen of the Black
Ajah. And one of the Forsaken as well, it seems. We could use your
help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other woman grimaced, embarrassed and regretful.
&ldquo;I cannot, Nynaeve. I cannot touch the world of flesh unless the
Horn calls me again. Or else the Wheel weaves me out. If it did
this moment, you would find only an infant mewling at her mother&rsquo;s
breast. As for Falme, the Horn had called us; we were not there as
you were, in the flesh. That is why the Power could not touch us.
Here, <em>all</em> is part of the dream, and the One Power could
destroy me as easily as you. More easily. I told you; I am an
archer, a sometime soldier, no more.&rdquo; Her complex golden braid
swung as she shook her head. &ldquo;I do not know why I am explaining. I
should not even be talking to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not? You&rsquo;ve spoken to me before. And Egwene
thought she saw you. That was you, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Nynaeve frowned.
&ldquo;How do you know my name? Do you just <em>know</em> things?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what I see and hear. I have watched you, and
listened, whenever I could find you. You and the other two women,
and the young man with his wolves. According to the precepts, we
may speak to none who know they are in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. And
yet, evil walks the dream as well as the world of flesh; you who
fight it attract me. Even knowing I can do almost nothing, I find
myself wanting to help you. But I cannot. It violates the precepts,
precepts which have held me for so many turns of the Wheel that in
my oldest, faintest memories I know I had already lived a hundred
times, or a thousand. Speaking to you violates precepts as strong
as law.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does,&rdquo; said a harsh, male voice.</p>

<p>Nynaeve jumped and almost lashed out with the Power.
The man was dark and strongly muscled, with the long hilts of two
swords thrusting above his shoulders as he strode the few paces
from where he had appeared to Birgitte. With what she had heard
from Birgitte, the swords were enough to name him as Gaidal Cain,
but where fair, golden-haired Birgitte was as beautiful as in the
stories, he was definitely not. In fact, he was perhaps as ugly a
man as Nynaeve had ever seen, his face wide and flat, his heavy
nose too big, and his mouth a gash, far too broad. Birgitte smiled
at him, though; her touch on his cheek held more than fondness. It
was a surprise to see he was the shorter. Stocky and muscled as he
was, powerful in his movements, he gave the impression of being
taller than he was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have almost always been linked,&rdquo; Birgitte told
Nynaeve without taking her eyes from Cain&rsquo;s. &ldquo;He is usually born
well before me&mdash;so I know my time approaches again when I
cannot find him&mdash;and I usually hate him at first sight in the
flesh. But we nearly always end lovers or wed. A simple story, but
I think we have spun it out in a thousand variations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cain ignored Nynaeve as though she did not exist.
&ldquo;The precepts exist for a reason, Birgitte. Nothing but strife and
trouble has ever come from breaking them.&rdquo; His voice was indeed
harsh, Nynaeve realized. Not at all like that of the man in the
stories.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I cannot sit by while evil fights,&rdquo; Birgitte
said quietly. &ldquo;Or perhaps I simply hunger for the flesh again. It
has been long since we were born last. The Shadow rises again,
Gaidal. It rises here. We must fight it. That is the reason we were
bound to the Wheel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the Horn calls us, we will fight. When the
Wheel weaves us, we will fight. Not until then!&rdquo; He glowered at
her. &ldquo;Have you forgotten what Moghedien promised you when we
followed Lews Therin? I saw her, Birgitte. She will know you
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Birgitte turned to Nynaeve. &ldquo;I will aid you as I can,
but do not expect too much. <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> is the whole of
my world, and I can do less here than you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve blinked; the dark, heavy man had not moved
that she had seen, but he suddenly stood two paces away, drawing a
honing stone along one of his swords with a soft, silky rasp.
Plainly, as far as he was concerned, Birgitte was speaking to the
air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can you tell of Moghedien, Birgitte? I must
know what I can, to face her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leaning on her bow, Birgitte frowned thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Facing Moghedien is difficult, and not only because she is
Forsaken. She hides and takes no risks. She attacks only where she
sees weakness, and moves only in shadows. If she fears defeat, she
will run; she is not one to fight to the last, even when doing so
has the chance of victory. A chance is not enough for Moghedien.
But do not take her lightly. She is a serpent coiled in high grass,
waiting her own moment to strike, with less compassion than the
snake. Especially here do not take her lightly. Lanfear always
claimed <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> for her own, but Moghedien could do
things here far beyond Lanfear, though she has not Lanfear&rsquo;s
strength in the world of flesh. I think she would not take the risk
of confronting Lanfear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve shivered, fear warring with the anger that
let her contain the Power. Moghedien. Lanfear. This woman spoke so
casually of the Forsaken. &ldquo;Birgitte, what did Moghedien promise
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She knew what I was, even though I did not. How, I
do not know.&rdquo; Birgitte glanced at Cain; he appeared absorbed in his
sword, but she lowered her voice anyway. &ldquo;She promised to make me
weep alone for as long as the Wheel turns. She said it as a fact
that simply had not happened yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet you are willing to help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I can, Nynaeve. Remember that I told you not to
expect too much.&rdquo; Once more she looked at the man sharpening his
sword. &ldquo;We will meet again, Nynaeve. If you are careful, and
survive.&rdquo; Hefting her silver bow, she went to put an arm around
Cain&rsquo;s shoulders and murmur in his ear. Whatever she said, Cain was
laughing as they vanished.</p>

<p>Nynaeve shook her head. Careful. Everybody was
telling her to be careful. A legendary hero who said she would
help, only there was not much she could do. And one of the Forsaken
in Tanchico.</p>

<p>The thought of Moghedien, of what the woman had done
to her, strengthened her anger until the One Power pulsed in her
like the sun. Abruptly she was back in the great hall where she had
been standing before, almost hoping the woman had returned. But the
hall was empty of life except for herself. Fury and the Power
roared through her till she thought her skin would crisp and
blacken. Moghedien, or any of the Black sisters, could sense her
far more easily holding the Power than without, but she held it
anyway. She almost wanted them to find her, so she could strike at
them. Temaile was very likely still in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. If
she went back up to that bedchamber, she could settle Temaile once
and for all. She could settle Temaile&mdash;and warn the rest. It
was enough to make her growl.</p>

<p>What had Moghedien been smiling at? Striding out to
the case, a wide glass box atop a carved table, she peered in. Six
mismatched figurines stood in a circle beneath the glass. A
foot-tall nude woman balanced on the toes of one foot, dancing, all
flowing lines, and a shepherd less than half as large, playing the
pipes with his crook on his shoulder and a sheep at his feet, were
as similar as any two. She had no doubt what had attracted the
Forsaken&rsquo;s smile, though.</p>

<p>In the center of the circle a red-lacquered wooden
stand held a disc as big as a man&rsquo;s hand, divided into halves by a
sinuous line, one side gleaming whiter than snow, the other blacker
than pitch. It was made of <em>cuendillar</em>, she knew; she had
seen its like, and only seven had ever been made. One of the seals
on the Dark One&rsquo;s prison; a focus for one of the locks that held
him away from the world in Shayol Ghul. This was perhaps as
important a discovery as whatever it was that threatened Rand. This
had to be gotten away from the Black Ajah.</p>

<p>Suddenly she became aware of her reflection. The top
of the case was the finest glass, without bubbles, and gave an
image as clear as a mirror, if fainter. Dark green folds of silk
draped her body so they showed every curve of breast and hip and
thigh. Long honey braids full of jade beads framed a face with big
brown eyes and a pouting mouth. The glow of <em>saidar</em> did not
show, of course. Disguised so she did not even know herself, she
walked about carrying a painted sign that screamed Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>can</em> be careful,&rdquo; she muttered. Yet she
held on a moment longer. The Power filling her was like life
bubbling along her limbs, all the pleasures she had ever known
seeping through her flesh. In the end, feeling foolish took enough
edge from her anger to allow her to let go. Or maybe it dulled her
anger to where she could no longer hold on.</p>

<p>Whatever the reason, it did not help her search. What
she was after had to be somewhere in this huge hall among all these
displays. Pulling her eyes away from what looked like the bones of
a toothy lizard ten paces long, she closed them. Need. Danger to
the Dragon Reborn, to Rand. Need.</p>

<p><em>Shift</em>.</p>

<p>She was standing inside the white silk rope along the
walls, the edge of a white stone pedestal touching her dress. What
lay on top did not look very dangerous at first glance&mdash;a
necklace and two bracelets of jointed black metal&mdash;but she
could come no closer to anything than this. <em>Not without sitting
on it</em>, she thought wryly.</p>

<p>She stretched her hand out to touch it&mdash;<em>
Pain. Sorrow. Suffering</em>&mdash;and jerked it back, gasping,
the raw emotions still echoing in her head. Even her faint doubts
vanished. This was what the Black Ajah was hunting. And if it still
sat on this pedestal in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, it sat there in
the waking world, too. She had beaten them. This white stone
pedestal.</p>

<p>Whirling around, she stared toward the glass case
that held the <em>cuendillar</em> seal, located the place she had
been standing where she first saw Moghedien. The woman had been
looking at this pedestal, at the bracelets and collar. Moghedien
had to know. But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Everything around her spun and blurred, fading.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">&ldquo;Wake up, Nynaeve,&rdquo; Elayne muttered, suppressing a
yawn as she shook the sleeping woman&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;It has to be an
hour by now. I want some sleep, too. Wake up, or I&rsquo;ll see how you
like your head in a bucket of water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s eyes popped open, staring up at her. &ldquo;If
she knows what it is, why hasn&rsquo;t she given it to them? If they know
who <em>she</em> is, why does she have to look at it in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod?</em> Is she hiding from them, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Braids tossing about as she wriggled up to sit with
her back against the head of the bed, Nynaeve jerked her silk shift
down. &ldquo;I will tell you what I am talking about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s mouth fell open as Nynaeve unfolded the tale
of what her meeting with Egwene had become. Searching with need.
Moghedien. Birgitte and Gaidal Cain. The black metal necklace and
bracelets. Asmodean in the Waste. One of the seals on the Dark
One&rsquo;s prison in the Panarch&rsquo;s Palace. Elayne sank down weakly onto
the side of the mattress long before Nynaeve came to Temaile and
the Panarch, thrown in almost as an afterthought. And changing her
appearance, masquerading as Rendra. If Nynaeve&rsquo;s face had not been
grimly serious, Elayne could have thought it one of Thom&rsquo;s wilder
stories.</p>

<p>Egeanin, sitting up cross-legged in her linen shift,
hands on knees, looked close to disbelieving. Elayne hoped Nynaeve
did not start a row because she had loosed the woman&rsquo;s wrists.</p>

<p>Moghedien. That was the most horrifying part. One of
the Forsaken in Tanchico. One of the Forsaken weaving the Power
around the two of them, making them tell her everything. Elayne
could not remember a bit of it. The thought was enough to press
both her hands to a suddenly queasy stomach. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether
Moghedien&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Light, could she really have just walked in
and made us</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>?</em>&mdash;&ldquo;is hiding from Liandrin
and the others, Nynaeve. It sounds like what Birgitte&rdquo;&mdash;<em>
Light</em>, Birgitte <em>giving her advice!</em>&mdash;&ldquo;said of
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever Moghedien is up to,&rdquo; Nynaeve said in a
tight voice, &ldquo;I mean to pick a bone clean with her.&rdquo; She slumped
back against the flower-carved headboard. &ldquo;In any case, we have to
get the seal away from them as well as this necklace and
bracelets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne shook her head. &ldquo;How can jewelry be dangerous
to Rand? Are you sure? Are they a <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> of some
sort? What did they look like exactly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They looked like a necklace and bracelets,&rdquo; Nynaeve
snapped in exasperation. &ldquo;Two jointed bracelets made of some black
metal, and a wide necklace like a black collar&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Her eyes
darted to Egeanin, but no faster than Elayne&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Unperturbed, the dark-haired woman knelt up to sit on
her heels. &ldquo;I have never heard of an <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> made for a man,
or any like the one you describe. No one tries to control a man who
can channel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is exactly what this is for,&rdquo; Elayne said
slowly. <em>Oh, Light, I suppose I was hoping it didn&rsquo;t exist</em>.
At least Nynaeve had found it first; at least they had a chance to
stop it being used against Rand.</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s eyes narrowed as she took in Egeanin&rsquo;s free
hands, but she did not mention them. &ldquo;Moghedien must be the only
one who knows. It makes no sense, otherwise. If we can find a way
into the palace, we can take the seal and the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;whatever it is.
And if we can bring Amathera out as well, Liandrin and her cronies
will find the Panarch&rsquo;s Legion and the Civil Watch, and maybe the
Whitecloaks, closing in. They&rsquo;ll not all be able to channel their
way out of that! The problem is getting inside undetected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have had a few thoughts on that,&rdquo; Elayne told her,
&ldquo;but I fear the men are going to give us difficulties over it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You leave them to me,&rdquo; Nynaeve snorted. &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; A
thumping clatter rose in the hall, a man shouted; as quickly as it
began, silence fell once more. Thom was on watch out there.</p>

<p>Elayne darted to pull open the door, embracing <em>
saidar</em> as she rushed out, but Nynaeve scrambled off the bed
right behind her. Egeanin as well.</p>

<p>Thom was just picking himself up off the floor, a
hand to his head. Juilin with his staff and Bayle Domon with his
cudgel stood over a man with pale yellow hair lying facedown on the
floor, unconscious.</p>

<p>Elayne hurried to Thom, trying gently to help him up.
He gave her a grateful smile, but stubbornly pushed her hands away.
&ldquo;I am quite all right, child.&rdquo; All right? A knot was rising on his
temple! &ldquo;The fellow was walking down the hall, when suddenly he
kicked me in the head. After my purse, I suppose.&rdquo; Just like that.
Kicked in the head, and he was all right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He would have had it, too,&rdquo; Juilin said, &ldquo;if I had
not come to see if Thom wanted a relief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did <em>I</em> not decide,&rdquo; Domon muttered. Their
hostility seemed less focused for a change.</p>

<p>It took Elayne only a moment to realize why. Nynaeve
and Egeanin were in the hall in their shifts. Juilin was eyeing
them both in an approving manner that would have caused trouble if
Rendra had seen it, though he was at least trying not to be
obvious. Domon made no effort at all to hide his frank appraisal of
Egeanin, crossing his arms and pursing his lips in disgusting
fashion while looking her up and down.</p>

<p>The situation dawned on the other women quickly, but
their reactions were quite different. Nynaeve, in her thin white
silk, gave the thief-catcher a flat stare and strode stiffly into
the room, poking a somewhat flushed face back around the side of
the doorframe. Egeanin, whose linen shift was considerably longer
and thicker than Nynaeve&rsquo;s&mdash;Egeanin, who had been cool
serenity while being made prisoner, who fought like a Warder&mdash;Egeanin went wide-eyed and crimson-faced, gasping in horror. Elayne
stared, amazed, as the Seanchan woman gave a mortified shriek and
<em>leaped</em> back inside.</p>

<p>Doors flung open and down the hall heads popped out;
they vanished instantly, to the bang of slamming doors, at the
sight of a man stretched out on the floor and others standing over
him. Heavy dragging noises suggested people blocking themselves in
with beds or wardrobes.</p>

<p>Long moments later, Egeanin finally peeked out
opposite Nynaeve, still scarlet to her hair. Elayne really did not
understand. The woman was in her shift, true, but it covered her
very nearly as well as Elayne&rsquo;s Taraboner dress did. Still, Juilin
and Domon had no right to ogle. She fixed the pair with a stare
that should have set them to rights immediately.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Domon was too busy chuckling and
rubbing his upper lip to notice. At least Juilin saw, even if he
did sigh heavily the way men did when they considered themselves
put upon unfairly. Avoiding her eyes, he bent to heave the
pale-haired fellow onto his back. A handsome enough man,
slender.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know this fellow,&rdquo; Juilin exclaimed. &ldquo;This is the
man who tried to rob me. Or so I thought,&rdquo; he added more slowly. &ldquo;I
do not believe in coincidence. Not unless the Dragon Reborn is in
the city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne exchanged frowns with Nynaeve. Surely the
stranger was not in the employ of Liandrin; the Black Ajah would
not use men to sneak about the halls any more&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Any more than
they would have hired street toughs. Elayne moved her gaze to
Egeanin questioningly. Nynaeve&rsquo;s was more demanding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is Seanchan,&rdquo; Egeanin said after a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A rescue attempt?&rdquo; Nynaeve murmured dryly, but the
other woman shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not doubt he was looking for me, but not for
rescue, I think. If he knows&mdash;or even suspects&mdash;that I
let Bethamin go free, he would be wanting to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;talk with me.&rdquo;
Elayne suspected it was rather more than talk, confirmed when
Egeanin added, &ldquo;It might be best if you slit his throat. He may try
to make trouble for you, too, if he thinks you are my friends, or
if he discovers you are Aes Sedai.&rdquo; The big Illianer smuggler gave
her a shocked look, and Juilin&rsquo;s jaw dropped almost to his chest.
Thom, on the other hand, nodded in a disturbingly thoughtful
fashion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are not here to slit Seanchan throats,&rdquo; Nynaeve
said as though that might change later. &ldquo;Bayle, Juilin, put him out
in the alley behind the inn. By the time he wakes, he&rsquo;ll be lucky
to have his smallclothes. Thom, find Rendra and tell her we want
strong tea in the Chamber of Falling Blossoms. And ask if she has
any willowbark or acem; I will make you something for your head.&rdquo;
The three men stared at her. &ldquo;Well, move!&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;We have
plans to make!&rdquo; She barely gave Elayne time to get back inside
before closing the door with a bang and beginning to pull her dress
over her head. Egeanin scrambled into hers as though the men were
still looking at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The better way is to ignore them, Egeanin,&rdquo; Elayne
said. It was odd to be advising someone older than Nynaeve, but
however competent the Seanchan woman was in other ways, she clearly
knew little about men. &ldquo;It only encourages them, otherwise. I do
not know why,&rdquo; she admitted, &ldquo;but it does. You were quite decently
covered. Really.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egeanin&rsquo;s head pushed out at the top of her dress.
&ldquo;Decent? I am not a serving girl. I am no shea dancer!&rdquo; Her scowl
became a perplexed frown. &ldquo;He is rather good-looking, though. I had
not thought of him so before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wondering what a shea dancer was, Elayne went to help
her with her buttons. &ldquo;Rendra will have something to say to you if
you allow Juilin to flirt with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dark-haired woman gave her a startled look over
her shoulder. &ldquo;The thief-catcher? It was Bayle Domon I meant. A
properly set-up man. But a smuggler,&rdquo; she sighed regretfully. &ldquo;A
lawbreaker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne supposed there was no accounting for tastes&mdash;Nynaeve certainly loved Lan, and he was much too stone-faced
and intimidating&mdash;but Bayle Domon? The man was half as wide
as he was tall, as thick as an Ogier!</p>

<p>&ldquo;You chatter like Rendra, Elayne,&rdquo; Nynaeve snapped.
She was struggling to do up her dress, both hands behind her. &ldquo;If
you have finished blathering about men, perhaps you won&rsquo;t mind
skipping over the new seamstress you&rsquo;ve no doubt found? We must
make plans. If we wait until we&rsquo;re with the men, they will try to
take it over, and I am in no mood to waste time putting them in
their place. Have you finished with her yet? I could use some help
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quickly fastening Egeanin&rsquo;s last small button, Elayne
went coolly to Nynaeve. She did <em>not</em> talk about men and
dresses. Not <em>nearly</em> as much as Rendra. Holding her braids
out of the way, Nynaeve gave her a frown when she tugged sharply at
the other woman&rsquo;s dress to do up the buttons. The close-spaced
triple row up the back was necessary, not simply ornament. Nynaeve
<em>would</em> let Rendra talk her into the most fashionably tight
bodices. And then say <em>other</em> people spent all their time
thinking about clothes. <em>She</em> certainly thought of other
things. &ldquo;I have been thinking how we can move inside the palace
unnoticed, Nynaeve. We can be all but invisible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she talked, Nynaeve&rsquo;s frowns smoothed out. Nynaeve
herself had conceived a way to enter the palace. When Egeanin made
a few suggestions, Nynaeve&rsquo;s mouth tightened, but the notions were
sensible, and even Nynaeve could not reject them out of hand. By
the time they were ready to go down to the Chamber of Falling
Blossoms, they had a plan agreed upon, and no intention of letting
the men change a whit of it. Moghedien, the Black Ajah, whoever
were running things in the Panarch&rsquo;s Palace, were going to lose
their prizes before they knew what had happened.</p>
