<h4><em>Beyond the Stone</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">E</span>gwene
stumbled, flinging her arms around Mist&rsquo;s neck
as the ground tilted under her feet. All about her, Aiel contended
with braying, sliding pack mules on a steep rocky slope where
nothing grew. Heat remembered from <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> hammered
her. The air shimmered before her eyes: the ground burned her feet
through the soles of her shoes. Her skin prickled painfully for a
moment, then sweat gushed from every pore. It only dampened her
dress, and the sweat seemed to evaporate immediately.</p>

<p>The struggling mules and tall Aiel nearly hid the
surroundings from her, but she saw a bit in flashes between them. A
thick gray stone column angled out of the ground not three paces
from her, scoured by windblown sand until there was no telling
whether it had ever been twin to the Portal Stone in Tear. Rugged
slab-sided mountains that looked carved by a mad giant&rsquo;s axe
broiled beneath a blazing sun in a cloudless sky. Yet in the center
of the long, barren valley far below, a mass of dense fog hung,
billowing like clouds; that scalding sun should surely have burned
it off in moments, but the fog rolled untouched. And out of that
roiling gray stuck the tops of towers, some spired, some ending
abruptly as though the masons still worked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was right,&rdquo; she murmured to herself. &ldquo;A city in
clouds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clutching his gelding&rsquo;s bridle, Mat was staring
around wide eyed. &ldquo;We made it!&rdquo; He laughed at her. &ldquo;We made it,
Egwene, and without any&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Burn me, we made it!&rdquo; He tugged
open his shirt laces at the neck. &ldquo;Light, it&rsquo;s hot. Burn me for
true!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly she realized Rand was on his knees, head
down, supporting himself with one hand on the ground. Pulling her
mare behind her, she pushed through the milling Aiel to him just as
Lan helped him to his feet. Moiraine was already there, studying
Rand with apparent calm&mdash;and the slight tightness at the
corners of her mouth that meant she would like to box his ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did it,&rdquo; Rand panted, looking around. The Warder
was all that was holding him upright; his face was drained and
drawn, like a man on his deathbed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You came close,&rdquo; Moiraine said coolly. Very coolly.
&ldquo;The <em>angreal</em> was not sufficient to the task. You must not
do this again. If you take chances, they must be reasoned and for a
strong purpose. They must be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t take chances, Moiraine. Mat&rsquo;s the fellow for
chances.&rdquo; Rand forced his right hand open; the <em>angreal</em>,
the fat little man, had driven the point of its sword into his
flesh, right into the branded heron. &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re right. Maybe I
did need one a little stronger. A little bit, maybe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He gave
a huffing laugh. &ldquo;It worked, Moiraine. That is what&rsquo;s important.
I&rsquo;ve outrun them all. It worked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is what matters,&rdquo; Lan said, nodding.</p>

<p>Egwene made a vexed <em>tsk</em>. Men. One almost
killed himself, then tried to make a joke of it, and another told
him he had done the right thing. Did they never grow up?</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fatigue of channeling is not like other
tiredness,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;I cannot rid you of it completely, not
when you have channeled as much as you did, but I will do what I
can. Perhaps what remains will remind you to be more careful in
future.&rdquo; She <em>was</em> angry; there was a definite hint of
satisfaction in her voice.</p>

<p>The glow of <em>saidar</em> surrounded the Aes Sedai
as she reached up to take Rand&rsquo;s head in her hands. A shuddering
gasp burst out of him, and he shivered uncontrollably, then jerked
back from her, pulling free of Lan as well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask, Moiraine,&rdquo; Rand said coldly, stuffing the <em>
angreal</em> into his belt pouch. &ldquo;Ask, first. I&rsquo;m not your pet dog
that you can do whatever you want to whenever you want.&rdquo; He
scrubbed his hands together to rub away the tiny trickle of
blood.</p>

<p>Egwene made that vexed sound again. Childish, and
ungrateful to boot. He could stand by himself now, though his eyes
still looked weary, and she did not have to see his palm to know
the tiny puncture was gone as if it had never been. Purely
ungrateful. Surprisingly, Lan did not call him down for speaking to
Moiraine in that fashion.</p>

<p>It came to her that the Aiel had gone absolutely
still now that they had the mules quieted. They stared outward
warily, not toward the valley and the fog shrouded city that must
be Rhuidean, but at two camps, one to either side of them perhaps
half a mile away. The two clusters of dozens upon dozens of low,
open-sided tents, one twice as large as the other, clung to the
mountain slope and very nearly disappeared against it, but the
gray-brown Aiel in each camp were clearly visible, short spears and
arrow-nocked horn bows in hand, veiling themselves if they were not
already. They seemed poised on the balls of their feet, ready to
attack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The peace of Rhuidean,&rdquo; a woman&rsquo;s voice called from
upslope, and Egwene could feel the tension leaving the Aiel
surrounding her. Those among the tents began lowering their veils,
though they still watched cautiously.</p>

<p>There was a third, much smaller encampment farther up
the mountain, she realized, a few of the low tents on a small level
patch. Four women were walking down from that camp, sedate and
dignified in dark bulky skirts and loose white blouses, with brown
or gray shawls around their shoulders despite heat that was
beginning to make Egwene feel light headed, and many necklaces and
bracelets of ivory and gold. Two had white hair, one hair the color
of the sun, flowing down their backs to the waist and held back
from their faces by folded kerchiefs tied around the forehead.</p>

<p>Egwene recognized one of the white haired women:
Amys, the Wise One she had met in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. Again
she was struck by the contrast between Amys&rsquo;s sun-darkened features
and her snowy hair; the Wise One just did not look old enough. The
second white-haired woman had a creased grandmotherly face, and one
of the others, with gray-streaked dark hair, seemed almost as old.
She was sure all four were Wise Ones, very likely the same who had
signed that letter to Moiraine.</p>

<p>The Aiel women stopped ten paces upslope from the
gathering around the Portal Stone and the grandmotherly woman
spread her open hands, speaking in an aged yet powerful voice. &ldquo;The
peace of Rhuidean be on you. Who comes to Chaendaer may return to
their holds in peace. There shall be no blood on the ground.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that the Aiel from Tear began to separate,
quickly apportioning the pack animals and the contents of the
hampers. They were not dividing by societies now; Egwene saw
Maidens going with several groups, some of which immediately began
making their way around the mountain, avoiding each other and the
camps, peace of Rhuidean or no. Others strode toward one or the
other large cluster of tents, where finally weapons were being put
down.</p>

<p>Not everyone had been sure of the peace of Rhuidean.
Lan released the hilt of his still-sheathed sword, although Egwene
had not seen him put his hands on it, and Mat hastily slipped a
pair of knives back into his sleeves. Rand stood with his thumbs
tucked behind his belt, but there was clear relief in his eyes.</p>

<p>Egwene looked for Aviendha, to ask a few questions
before she approached Amys. Surely the Aiel woman would be a little
more forthcoming about the Wise Ones here, in her own land. She
spotted the Maiden, carrying a large clinking jute sack, and two
rolled wall hangings over her shoulder, as she started briskly for
one of the big encampments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will stay, Aviendha,&rdquo; the Wise One with gray
streaks in her hair said loudly. Aviendha stopped in her tracks,
not looking at anyone.</p>

<p>Egwene started to go to her, but Moiraine murmured,
&ldquo;Best not to interfere. I doubt she will want sympathy, or see
anything else if you offer it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene nodded in spite of herself. Aviendha did look
as if she wanted to be left alone. What did the Wise Ones want with
her? Had she broken some rule, some law?</p>

<p>She herself would not have minded some more company.
She felt very exposed standing there with no Aiel around her, and
all those among the tents watching. The Aiel who had come from the
Stone had been courteous even when not exactly friendly; the
watchers looked neither. It was a temptation to embrace <em>
saidar</em>. Only Moiraine, serene and cool as ever despite
perspiration on her face, and Lan, as unperturbed as the rocks
around them, kept her from it. They would know if there was danger.
As long as they accepted the situation, she would. But she did wish
those Aiel would stop staring.</p>

<p>Rhuarc climbed the slope with a smile. &ldquo;I am come
back, Amys, though not by the way you expected, I will wager.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew you would be here today, shade of my heart.&rdquo;
She reached up to touch his cheek, letting her brown shawl fall
down onto her arms. &ldquo;My sister-wife sends her heart to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you meant about Dreaming,&rdquo; Egwene said
softly to Moiraine. Lan was the only other close enough to hear.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why you were willing to let Rand try to bring us here by
Portal Stone. They knew about it, and told you in that letter. No,
that doesn&rsquo;t make sense. If they had mentioned a Portal Stone, you
wouldn&rsquo;t have tried talking him out of it. They knew we&rsquo;d be here,
though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine nodded without taking her eyes from the Wise
Ones. &ldquo;They wrote that they would meet us here, on Chaendaer,
today. I thought it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;unlikely&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;until Rand mentioned the
Stones. When he was sure&mdash;certain beyond my dissuading&mdash;that one existed here&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Let us just say it suddenly seemed <em>
very</em> likely we would reach Chaendaer today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene took a deep breath of hot air. So that was one
of the things Dreamers could do. She could not wait to start
learning. She wanted to go after Rhuarc and introduce herself to
Amys&mdash;reintroduce herself&mdash;but Rhuarc and Amys were
looking into one another&rsquo;s eyes in a way that excluded
intruders.</p>

<p>A man had come out from each of the camps, one tall
and broad-shouldered, flame-haired and still short of his middle
years, the other older and darker, no less tall but more slender.
They stopped a few paces to either side of Rhuarc and the Wise
Ones. The older, leathery-faced man carried no visible weapon
except his heavy bladed belt knife, but the other carried spears
and hide buckler, and held his head high with a fiercely prideful
scowl directed at Rhuarc.</p>

<p>Rhuarc ignored him, turning to the older man. &ldquo;I see
you, Heirn. Has one of the sept chiefs decided I am already dead?
Who seeks to take my place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you, Rhuarc. No one of the Taardad has entered
Rhuidean or seeks to. Amys said she would come meet you here today,
and these other Wise Ones traveled with her. I brought these men of
the Jindo sept to see they arrived safely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rhuarc nodded solemnly. Egwene had the feeling
something important had just been said, or hinted at. The Wise Ones
did not look at the fiery-haired man, and neither did Rhuarc or
Heirn, but from the color rising in the fellow&rsquo;s cheeks, they might
as well have been staring at him. She glanced at Moiraine and got a
tiny shake of the head; the Aes Sedai did not understand
either.</p>

<p>Lan leaned down between them, speaking quietly. &ldquo;A
Wise One can go anywhere safely, into any hold regardless of clan.
I think not even blood feud touches a Wise One. This Heirn came to
protect Rhuarc from whoever the other camp is, but it would not be
honorable to say it.&rdquo; Moiraine lifted one eyebrow a trifle, and he
added, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much of them, but I fought them often before I
met you. You have never asked me about them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will remedy that,&rdquo; the Aes Sedai said dryly.</p>

<p>Turning back to the Wise Ones and the three men made
Egwene&rsquo;s head swim. Lan pushed an unstoppered leather water bottle
into her hands, and she tilted her head back to drink gratefully.
The water was lukewarm and smelled of leather, but in the heat it
tasted fresh from the spring. She offered the half empty bottle to
Moiraine, who drank sparingly and handed it back. Egwene was glad
to gulp down the rest, closing her eyes; water splashed over her
head, and she opened them again quickly. Lan was emptying another
water bottle over her, and Moiraine&rsquo;s hair already dripped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This heat can kill if you are not used to it,&rdquo; the
Warder explained as he wet down a pair of plain white linen scarves
pulled from his coat. At his instructions, she and Moiraine tied
the soaked cloths around their foreheads. Rand and Mat were doing
the same. Lan left his own head unprotected to the sun; nothing
seemed to faze the man.</p>

<p>The silence between Rhuarc and the Aielmen with him
had stretched out, but the clan chief finally turned to the
flame-haired man. &ldquo;Do the Shaido lack a clan chief, then, Couladin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suladric is dead,&rdquo; the man answered. &ldquo;Muradin has
entered Rhuidean. Should he fail, I will enter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have not asked, Couladin,&rdquo; the grandmotherly
Wise One said in that reedy yet strong voice. &ldquo;Should Muradin fail,
ask then. We are four, enough to say yes or no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is my right, Bair,&rdquo; Couladin said angrily. He had
the look of a man not used to being balked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is your right to ask,&rdquo; the thin voiced woman
replied. &ldquo;It is ours to answer. I do not think you will be allowed
to enter, whatever happens to Muradin. You are flawed within,
Couladin.&rdquo; She shifted her gray shawl, rewrapping it around her
angular shoulders in a way that suggested she had said more than
she considered necessary.</p>

<p>The flame-haired man&rsquo;s face grew red. &ldquo;My
first-brother will return marked as clan chief, and we will lead
the Shaido to great honor! We mean to&mdash;!&rdquo; He snapped his mouth
shut, almost quivering.</p>

<p>Egwene thought she would keep an eye on him if he
remained anywhere close to her. He reminded her of the Congars and
the Coplins back home, full of boasts and trouble. She had
certainly never before seen any Aiel display so much raw
emotion.</p>

<p>Amys seemed to have dismissed him already. &ldquo;There is
one who came with you, Rhuarc,&rdquo; she said. Egwene expected the woman
to speak to her, but Amys&rsquo;s eyes swept straight to Rand. Moiraine
was obviously not surprised. Egwene wondered what had been in that
letter from these four Wise Ones that the Aes Sedai had not
revealed.</p>

<p>Rand looked taken aback for a moment, hesitating, but
then he strode up the slope to stand near Rhuarc at eye level to
the women. Sweat plastered his white shirt to his body and made
darker patches on his breeches. With a twisted white cloth tied
around his head, he certainly did not look so grand as he had in
the Heart of the Stone. He made an odd bow; left foot advanced,
left hand on knee, right hand outstretched palm upward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the right of blood,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I ask leave to
enter Rhuidean, for the honor of our ancestors and the memory of
what was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amys blinked in evident surprise, and Bair murmured,
&ldquo;An ancient form, but the question has been asked. I answer
yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I also answer yes, Bair,&rdquo; Amys said. &ldquo;Seana?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This man is no Aiel,&rdquo; Couladin broke in angrily.
Egwene suspected he was very nearly always angry. &ldquo;It is death for
him to be on this ground! Why has Rhuarc brought him? Why&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you wish to be a Wise One, Couladin?&rdquo; Bair asked,
a frown deepening the creases on her face. &ldquo;Put on a dress and come
to me, and I will see if you can be trained. Until then, be silent
when Wise Ones speak!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mother was Aiel,&rdquo; Rand said in a strained
voice.</p>

<p>Egwene stared at him. Kari al&rsquo;Thor had died while
Egwene was barely out of her cradle, but if Tam&rsquo;s wife had been
Aiel, Egwene would certainly have heard of it. She glanced at
Moiraine; the Aes Sedai was watching, smooth faced, calm. Rand did
look a great deal like the Aielmen, with his height and gray blue
eyes and reddish hair, but this was ridiculous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not your mother,&rdquo; Amys said slowly. &ldquo;Your father.&rdquo;
Egwene shook her head. This approached madness. Rand opened his
mouth, but Amys did not let him speak. &ldquo;Seana, how do you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the woman with gray streaked hair said.
&ldquo;Melaine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The last of the four, a handsome woman with golden-red
hair, no more than ten or fifteen years older than Egwene,
hesitated. &ldquo;It must be done,&rdquo; she said finally, and unwillingly. &ldquo;I
answer yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been answered,&rdquo; Amys told Rand. &ldquo;You may go
into Rhuidean, and&mdash;&rdquo; She cut off as Mat scrambled up to copy
Rand&rsquo;s bow awkwardly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I also ask to enter Rhuidean,&rdquo; he said shakily.</p>

<p>The four Wise Ones stared at him. Rand&rsquo;s head whipped
around in surprise. Egwene thought no one could be more shocked
than she was, but Couladin proved her wrong. Lifting one of his
spears with a snarl, he stabbed at Mat&rsquo;s chest.</p>

<p>The glow of <em>saidar</em> surrounded Amys and
Melaine, and flows of Air lifted the fiery haired man and flung him
back a dozen paces.</p>

<p>Egwene stared, wide eyed. They could channel. At
least, two of them could. Suddenly Amys&rsquo;s youthfully smooth
features beneath that white hair leaped out at her for what they
were, something very close to Aes Sedai agelessness. Moiraine was
absolutely still. Egwene could almost hear her thoughts buzzing,
though. This was plainly as much of a surprise to the Aes Sedai as
to herself.</p>

<p>Couladin scrambled to his feet in a crouch. &ldquo;You
accept this outlander as one of us,&rdquo; he rasped, pointing at Rand
with the spear he had attempted to use on Mat. &ldquo;If you say it, then
so be it. He is still a soft wetlander, and Rhuidean will kill
him.&rdquo; The spear swung to Mat, who was trying to slip a knife back
up his sleeve without being noticed. &ldquo;But he&mdash;it is death for
him to be here, and sacrilege for him to even <em>ask</em> to enter
Rhuidean. None but those of the blood may enter. None!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go back to your tents, Couladin,&rdquo; Melaine said
coldly. &ldquo;And you, Heirn. And you, as well, Rhuarc. This is business
of Wise Ones, and none of men save those who have asked. Go!&rdquo;
Rhuarc and Heirn nodded and walked away toward the smaller set of
tents, talking together. Couladin glared at Rand and Mat, and at
the Wise Ones, before jerking around and stalking off toward the
larger camp.</p>

<p>The Wise Ones exchanged glances. Troubled glances,
Egwene would have said, though they were almost as good as Aes
Sedai at keeping their faces blank when they wanted to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not permitted,&rdquo; Amys said finally. &ldquo;Young man,
you do not know what you have done. Go back with the others.&rdquo; Her
eyes brushed across Egwene and Moiraine and Lan, standing alone now
with the horses near the wind-scoured Portal Stone. Egwene could
not find any recognition for her in that glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Mat sounded desperate. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come this
far, but this doesn&rsquo;t count, does it? I have to go to
Rhuidean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not permitted,&rdquo; Melaine said sharply, her long
red-gold hair swinging as she shook her head. &ldquo;You have no Aiel
blood in your veins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand had been studying Mat all this time. &ldquo;He comes
with me,&rdquo; he said suddenly. &ldquo;You gave me permission, and he can
come with me whether you say he can or not.&rdquo; He stared back at the
Wise Ones, not defiantly, merely determined, set in his mind.
Egwene knew him like this; he would not back down whatever they
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not permitted,&rdquo; Melaine said firmly,
addressing her sisters. She pulled her shawl up to cover her head.
&ldquo;The law is clear. No woman may go to Rhuidean more than twice, no
man more than once, and none at all save they have the blood of
Aiel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seana shook her head. &ldquo;Much is changing, Melaine. The
old ways&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he is the one,&rdquo; Bair said, &ldquo;the Time of Change is
upon us. Aes Sedai stand on Chaendaer, and <em>Aan&rsquo;allein</em> with
his shifting cloak. Can we hold to the old ways still? Knowing how
much is to change?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We cannot hold,&rdquo; Amys said. &ldquo;All stands on the edge
of change, now. Melaine?&rdquo; The golden haired woman looked at the
mountains around them, and the fog shrouded city below, then sighed
and nodded. &ldquo;It is done,&rdquo; Amys said, turning to Rand and Mat.
&ldquo;You,&rdquo; she began, then paused. &ldquo;By what name do you call
yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat. Mat Cauthon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amys nodded. &ldquo;You, Rand al&rsquo;Thor, must go into the
heart of Rhuidean, to the very center. If you wish to go with him,
Mat Cauthon, so be it, but know that most men who enter Rhuidean&rsquo;s
heart do not come back, and some return mad. You may carry neither
food nor water, in remembrance of our wanderings after the
Breaking. You must go to Rhuidean unarmed, save with your hands and
your own heart, to honor the Jenn. If you have weapons, place them
on the ground before us. They will be here for you when you return.
If you return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand unsheathed his belt knife and laid it at Amys&rsquo;s
feet, then after a moment added the green stone carving of the
round little man. &ldquo;That is the best I can do,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Mat began with his belt knife and kept right on,
pulling knives from his sleeves and under his coat, even one from
down the back of his neck, fashioning a pile that seemed to impress
even the Aiel women. He made as if to stop, looked at the women,
then took two more from each boot top. &ldquo;I forgot them,&rdquo; he said
with a grin and shrug. The Wise Ones&rsquo; unblinking looks wiped his
grin away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are pledged to Rhuidean,&rdquo; Amys said formally,
looking over the men&rsquo;s heads, and the other three responded
together, &ldquo;Rhuidean belongs to the dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They may not speak to the living until they return,&rdquo;
she intoned, and again the others answered. &ldquo;The dead do not speak
to the living.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do not see them, until they stand among the
living once more.&rdquo; Amys drew her shawl across her eyes, and one by
one the other three did the same. Faces hidden, they spoke in
unison. &ldquo;Begone from among the living, and do not haunt us with
memories of what is lost. Speak not of what the dead see.&rdquo; Silent
then, they stood there, holding their shawls up, waiting.</p>

<p>Rand and Mat looked at one another. Egwene wanted to
go to them, to speak to them&mdash;they wore the fixed too-steady
faces of men who did not want anyone to know they were uneasy or
afraid&mdash;but that might break the ceremony.</p>

<p>Finally Mat barked a laugh. &ldquo;Well, I suppose the dead
can talk to each other, at least. I wonder if this counts for&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;No matter. Do you suppose it&rsquo;s all right if we ride?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;I think we have to
walk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, burn my aching feet. We might as well get on
with it then. It&rsquo;ll take half the afternoon just to get there. If
we&rsquo;re lucky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand gave Egwene a reassuring smile as they started
down the mountain, as if to convince her there was no danger,
nothing untoward. Mat&rsquo;s grin was the sort he wore when doing
something particularly foolish, like trying to dance on the peak of
a roof.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t going to do anything&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>crazy</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;are you?&rdquo; Mat said. &ldquo;I mean to come back alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; Rand replied. &ldquo;So do I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They passed from hearing, growing smaller and smaller
as they descended. When they had dwindled to tiny shapes, barely
distinguishable as people, the Wise Ones lowered their shawls.</p>

<p>Straightening her dress, and wishing she were not so
sweaty, Egwene climbed the short distance to them leading Mist.
&ldquo;Amys? I am Egwene al&rsquo;Vere. You said I should&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amys cut her off with a raised hand, and looked to
where Lan was leading Mandarb and Pips and Jeade&rsquo;en, behind
Moiraine and Aldieb. &ldquo;This is women&rsquo;s business, now, <em>
Aan&rsquo;allein</em>. You must stand aside. Go to the tents. Rhuarc will
offer you water and shade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan waited for Moiraine&rsquo;s slight nod before bowing
and walking off in the direction Rhuarc had gone. The shifting
cloak hanging down his back sometimes gave him the appearance of a
disembodied head and arms floating across the ground ahead of the
three horses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you call him that?&rdquo; Moiraine asked when he
was out of earshot. &ldquo;One Man. Do you know him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know of him, Aes Sedai.&rdquo; Amys made the title
sound an address between equals. &ldquo;The last of the Malkieri. The man
who will not give up his war against the Shadow though his nation
is long destroyed by it. There is much honor in him. I knew from
the dream that if you came, it was almost certain <em>
Aan&rsquo;allein</em> would as well, but I did not know he obeyed
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is my Warder,&rdquo; Moiraine said simply.</p>

<p>Egwene thought the Aes Sedai was troubled despite her
tone, and she knew why. <em>Almost</em> certain Lan would come with
Moiraine? Lan always followed Moiraine; he would follow her into
the Pit of Doom without blinking. Nearly as interesting to Egwene
was &ldquo;<em>if you came.</em>&rdquo; Had the Wise Ones know they were coming
or not? Perhaps interpreting the Dream was not as straightforward
as she hoped. She was about to ask, when Bair spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aviendha? Come here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha had been squatting disconsolately off to one
side, arms wrapped around her knees, staring at the ground. She
stood slowly. If Egwene had not known better, she would have
thought the other woman was afraid. Aviendha&rsquo;s feet dragged as she
climbed to where the Wise Ones stood and set her bag and rolled
wall hangings at her feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is time,&rdquo; Bair said, not ungently. Still, there
was no compromise in her pale blue eyes. &ldquo;You have run with the
spears as long as you can. Longer than you should have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha flung up her head defiantly. &ldquo;I am a Maiden
of the Spear. I do not want to be a Wise One. I will not be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Wise Ones&rsquo; faces hardened. Egwene was reminded of
the Women&rsquo;s Circle back home confronting a woman who was heading
off into some foolishness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have already been treated more gently than it
was in my day,&rdquo; Amys said in a voice like stone. &ldquo;I, too, refused
when called. My spear-sisters broke my spears before my eyes. They
took me to Bair and Coedelin bound hand and foot and wearing only
my skin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a pretty little doll tucked under your arm,&rdquo;
Bair said dryly, &ldquo;to remind you how childish you were. As I
remember, you ran away nine times in the first month.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amys nodded grimly. &ldquo;And was made to blubber like a
child for each of them. I only ran away five times the second
month. I thought I was as strong and hard as a woman could be. I
was not smart, though; it took me half a year to learn you were
stronger and harder than I could ever be, Bair. Eventually I
learned my duty, my obligation to the people. As you will,
Aviendha. Such as you and I, we have that obligation. You are not a
child. It is time to put away dolls&mdash;and spears&mdash;and
become the woman you are meant to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly, Egwene knew why she had felt such a kinship
with Aviendha from the first, knew why Amys and the others meant
her to be a Wise One. Aviendha could channel. Like herself, like
Elayne and Nynaeve&mdash;and Moiraine, for that matter&mdash;she
was one of those rare women who not only could be taught to
channel, but who had the ability born in her, so she would touch
the True Source eventually whether she knew what she was doing or
not. Moiraine&rsquo;s face was still, calm, but Egwene saw confirmation
in her eyes. The Aes Sedai had surely known from the first time she
came within arm&rsquo;s reach of the Aiel woman. Egwene realized she
could feel that same kinship with Amys and Melaine. Not with Bair
or Seana, though. Only the first two could channel; she was sure of
it. And now she could sense the same in Moiraine. It was the first
time she had ever felt that. The Aes Sedai was a distant woman.</p>

<p>Some of the Wise Ones, at least, apparently saw more
in Moiraine&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;You meant to take her to your White Tower,&rdquo;
Bair said, &ldquo;to make her one of you. She is Aiel, Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She can be very strong if she is trained properly,&rdquo;
Moiraine replied. &ldquo;As strong as Egwene will be. In the Tower, she
can reach that strength.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can teach her as well, Aes Sedai.&rdquo; Melaine&rsquo;s
voice was smooth enough, but contempt tinged her unwavering
green-eyed stare. &ldquo;Better. I have spoken with Aes Sedai. You coddle women
in the Tower. The Three-fold Land is no place for coddling.
Aviendha will learn what she can do while you would still have her
playing games.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene gave Aviendha a concerned look; the other
woman was staring at her feet, defiance gone. If they thought
training in the Tower was <em>coddling</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She had been
worked harder and disciplined more strictly as a novice than ever
before in her life. She felt a true pang of sympathy for the Aiel
woman.</p>

<p>Amys held out her hands, and Aviendha reluctantly
laid her spears and buckler in them, flinching when the Wise One
threw them aside to clatter on the ground. Slowly Aviendha slid her
cased bow from her back and surrendered it, unbuckled the belt
holding her quiver and sheathed knife. Amys took each offering and
tossed it away like rubbish; Aviendha gave a little jerk each time.
A tear trembled at the corner of one blue-green eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you have to treat her this way?&rdquo; Egwene demanded
angrily. Amys and the others turned flat stares on her, but she was
not about to be intimidated. &ldquo;You are treating things she cares
about as trash.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She must see them as trash,&rdquo; Seana said. &ldquo;When she
returns&mdash;if she returns&mdash;she will burn them and scatter
the ashes. The metal she will give to a smith to make simple
things. Not weapons. Not even a carving knife. Buckles, or pots, or
puzzles for children. Things she will give away with her own hands
when they are made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Three-fold Land is not soft, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Bair
said. &ldquo;&rdquo;Soft things die, here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em>, Aviendha.&rdquo; Amys gestured to
the discarded weapons. &ldquo;Your new clothes will await your
return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mechanically, Aviendha stripped, tossing coat and
breeches, soft boots, everything onto the pile. Naked, she stood
without wriggling a toe, though Egwene thought her own feet would
blister through her shoes. She remembered watching as the clothes
she had worn to the White Tower were burned, a severing of ties to
an earlier life, but it had not been like this. Not this stark.</p>

<p>When Aviendha started to add the sack and the wall
hangings to the pile, Seana took them from her. &ldquo;These you can have
back. If you return. If not, they will go to your family, for
remembrance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha nodded. She did not seem afraid. Reluctant,
angry, even sullen, but not afraid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Rhuidean,&rdquo; Amys said, &ldquo;you will find three rings,
arranged so.&rdquo; She drew three lines in the air, joining together in
the middle. &ldquo;Step through any one. You will see your future laid
before you, again and again, in variation. They will not guide you
wholly, as is best, for they will fade together as do stories heard
long ago, yet you will remember enough to know some things that
must be, for you, despised as they may be, and some that must not,
cherished hopes that they are. This is the beginning of being
called wise. Some women never return from the rings; perhaps they
could not face the future. Some who survive the rings do not
survive their second trip to Rhuidean, to the heart. You are not
giving up a hard and dangerous life for a softer, but for a harder
and more dangerous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. Amys was describing a <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. What kind of place was this Rhuidean? Egwene
found herself wanting to go down there herself, to find out. That
was foolish. She was not here to take unnecessary risks with <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em> she knew nothing about.</p>

<p>Melaine cupped Aviendha&rsquo;s chin and turned the younger
woman&rsquo;s face to her. &ldquo;You have the strength,&rdquo; she said with quiet
conviction. &ldquo;A strong mind and a strong heart are your weapons now,
but you hold them as surely as you ever held a spear. Remember
them, use them, and they will see you through anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene was surprised. Of the four, she would have
picked the sun-haired woman last to show compassion.</p>

<p>Aviendha nodded, and even managed a smile. &ldquo;I will
beat those men to Rhuidean. They cannot run.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Each Wise One in turn kissed her lightly on each
cheek, murmuring, &ldquo;Come back to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Catching Aviendha&rsquo;s hand, Egwene squeezed it and got
a squeeze in return. Then the Aiel woman was running down the
mountainside in leaps. It seemed she might well catch up to Rand
and Mat. Egwene watched her go worriedly. This was something like
being raised to Accepted, it seemed, but without any novice
training first, without anyone to give small comfort afterward.
What would it have been like to be raised Accepted on her first day
in the Tower? She thought she might have gone mad. Nynaeve had been
raised so, because of her strength; she thought at least some of
Nynaeve&rsquo;s distaste for Aes Sedai came from what she had experienced
then. <em>Come back to us</em>, she thought. <em>Be
steadfast</em>.</p>

<p>When Aviendha passed out of sight, Egwene sighed and
turned back to the Wise Ones. She had her own purpose here, and
holding back from it would help no one. &ldquo;Amys, in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> you told me I should come to you to learn. I
have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haste,&rdquo; the white haired woman said. &ldquo;We have been
hasty, because Aviendha struggled so long against her <em>toh</em>,
because we feared the Shaido might don veils, even here, if we did
not send Rand al&rsquo;Thor into Rhuidean before they could think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You believe they&rsquo;d have tried to kill him?&rdquo; Egwene
said. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s the one you sent people over the Dragonwall to find.
He Who Comes With the Dawn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bair shifted her shawl. &ldquo;Perhaps he is. We shall see.
If he lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has his mother&rsquo;s eyes,&rdquo; Amys said, &ldquo;and much of
her in his face as well as something of his father, but Couladin
could see only his clothes, and his horse. The other Shaido would
have as well, and perhaps the Taardad, too. Outlanders are not
allowed on this ground, and now there are five of you. No, four;
Rand al&rsquo;Thor is no outlander, wherever he was raised. But we have
already allowed one to enter Rhuidean, which is also forbidden.
Change comes like an avalanche whether we want it or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must come,&rdquo; Bair said, not sounding happy. &ldquo;The
Pattern plants us where it will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You knew Rand&rsquo;s parents?&rdquo; Egwene asked cautiously.
Whatever they said, she still thought of Tam and Kari al&rsquo;Thor as
Rand&rsquo;s parents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is his story,&rdquo; Amys said, &ldquo;if he wants to hear
it.&rdquo; By the firmness of her mouth, she would not say another word
on the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; Bair said. &ldquo;There is no need for haste, now.
Come. We offer you water and shade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene&rsquo;s knees nearly buckled at the mention of
shade. The once-sopping kerchief around her forehead was almost
dry; the top of her head felt baked, and the rest of her scarcely
less. Moiraine seemed just as grateful to follow the Wise Ones up
to one of the small clusters of low, open-sided tents.</p>

<p>A tall man in sandals and hooded white robes took
their horses&rsquo; reins. His Aiel face looked odd in the deep soft
cowl, with downcast eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give the animals water,&rdquo; Bair said before ducking
into the low, unwalled tent, and the man bowed to her back,
touching his forehead.</p>

<p>Egwene hesitated over letting the man lead Mist away.
He seemed confident, but what would an Aiel know of horses? Still,
she did not think he would harm them, and it did look wonderfully
darker inside the tent. It was, and delightfully cool compared to
outside.</p>

<p>The roof of the tent rose to a peak around a hole,
but even under that there was barely room to stand. As if to make
up for the drab colors the Aiel wore, large gold tasseled red
cushions lay scattered over brightly colored carpets layered
thickly enough to pad the hard ground beneath. Egwene and Moiraine
imitated the Wise Ones, sinking to the carpet and leaning on one
elbow on a cushion. They were all in a circle, nearly close enough
to touch the next woman.</p>

<p>Bair struck a small brass gong, and two young women
entered with silver trays, bending gracefully, robed in white, with
deep cowls and downturned eyes, like the man who had taken the
horses. Kneeling in the middle of the tent, one filled a small
silver cup with wine for each of the women reclining on a cushion,
and the other poured larger cups of water. Without a word, they
backed out bowing, leaving the gleaming trays and pitchers, beaded
with condensation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is water and shade,&rdquo; Bair said, lifting her
water, &ldquo;freely given. Let there be no constraints between us. All
here are welcome, as first-sisters are welcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let there be no constraints,&rdquo; Amys and the other two
murmured. After one sip of water, the Aiel women named themselves
formally. Bair, of the Haido sept of the Shaarad Aiel. Amys, of the
Nine Valleys sept of the Taardad Aiel. Melaine, of the Jhirad sept
of the Goshien Aiel. Seana, of the Black Cliff sept of the Nakai
Aiel.</p>

<p>Egwene and Moiraine followed the ritual, though
Moiraine&rsquo;s mouth tightened when Egwene called herself an Aes Sedai
of the Green Ajah.</p>

<p>As if the sharing of water and names had broken down
a wall, the mood in the tent changed palpably. Smiles from the Aiel
women, a subtle relaxation, and said formalities were done.</p>

<p>Egwene was more grateful for the water than for the
wine. It might be cooler in the tent than outside, but just
breathing still dried her throat. At Amys&rsquo;s gesture she eagerly
poured a second cup.</p>

<p>The people in white had been a surprise. It was
foolish, but she realized she had been thinking that except for the
Wise Ones Aiel were all like Rhuarc and Aviendha, warriors. Of
course they had blacksmiths and weavers and other craftsmen; they
must. Why not servants? Only, Aviendha had been disdainful of the
servants in the Stone, not letting them do anything for her that
she could avoid. These people with their humble demeanor did not
act like Aiel at all. She did not recall seeing any white in the
two large camps. &ldquo;Is it only Wise Ones who have servants?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>Melaine choked on her wine. &ldquo;Servants?&rdquo; she
gasped. &ldquo;They are <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>, not servants.&rdquo; She
sounded as if that should explain everything,</p>

<p>Moiraine frowned slightly over her winecup.
&ldquo;<em>Gai&rsquo;shain</em>? How does that translate? &lsquo;Those sworn to peace in
battle&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are simply <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>,&rdquo; Amys said. She
seemed to realize they did not understand. &ldquo;Forgive me, but do you
know of <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Honor and obligation,&rdquo; Moiraine replied promptly.
&ldquo;Or perhaps honor and duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those are the words, yes. But the meaning. We live
by <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>, Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not try to tell them all, Amys,&rdquo; Bair cautioned.
&ldquo;I once spent a month trying to explain <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em> to a
wetlander, and at the end she had more questions than at the
beginning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amys nodded. &ldquo;I will stay to the core. If you wish it
explained, Moiraine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene would as soon have begun talk of Dreaming, and
training, but to her irritation, the Aes Sedai said, &ldquo;Yes, if you
will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a nod to Moiraine, Amys began. &ldquo;I will follow
the line of <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> simply. In the dance of spears, the
most <em>ji</em>, honor, is earned by touching an armed enemy
without killing, or harming in any way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The most honor because it is so difficult,&rdquo; Seana
said, bluish gray eyes crinkling wryly, &ldquo;and thus so seldom
done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The smallest honor comes from killing,&rdquo; Amys
continued. &ldquo;A child or a fool can kill. In between is the taking of
a captive. I pare it down, you see. There are many degrees. <em>
Gai&rsquo;shain</em> are captives taken so, though a warrior who has been
touched may sometimes demand to be taken <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> to
reduce his enemy&rsquo;s honor and his own loss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maidens of the Spear and Stone Dogs especially are
known for this,&rdquo; Seana put in, bringing a sharp look from Amys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I tell this, or do you? To continue. Some may not
be taken <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>, of course. A Wise One, a blacksmith, a
child, a woman with child or one who has a child under the age of
ten. A <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> has <em>toh</em> to his or her captor.
For <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>, this is to serve one year and a day,
obeying humbly, touching no weapon, doing no violence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene was interested in spite of herself. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
they try to escape? I certainly would.&rdquo; <em>I&rsquo;ll never let anyone
make me a prisoner again!</em></p>

<p>The Wise Ones looked shocked. &ldquo;It has happened,&rdquo;
Seana said stiffly, &ldquo;but there is no honor in it. A <em>
gai&rsquo;shain</em> who ran away would be returned by his or her sept to
begin the year and a day anew. The loss of honor is so great that a
first-brother or first-sister might go as <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> as
well to discharge the sept&rsquo;s <em>toh</em>. More than one, if they
feel the loss of <em>ji</em> is great.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine seemed to be taking it all in calmly,
sipping her water, but it was all Egwene could do not to shake her
head. The Aiel were insane; that was all there was to it. It got
worse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> now make an arrogance of
humbleness,&rdquo; Melaine said disapprovingly. &ldquo;They think they earn
honor by it, taking obedience and meekness to the point of mockery.
This is a new thing and foolish. It has no part in <em>
ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bair laughed, a startling rich sound compared to her
reedy voice. &ldquo;There have always been fools. When I was a girl, and
the Shaarad and the Tomanelle were stealing each other&rsquo;s cattle and
goats every night, Chenda, the roofmistress of Mainde Cut, was
pushed aside by a young Haido Water Seeker during a raid. She came
to Bent Valley and demanded the boy make her <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>;
she would not allow him to gain the honor of having touched her
because <em>she had a carving knife in her hands when he did</em>.
A carving knife! It was a weapon, she claimed, as if she were a
Maiden. The boy had no choice but to do as she demanded, for all
the laughter when he did. One does not send a roofmistress barefoot
back to her hold. Before the year and a day was done, the Haido
sept and the Jenda sept exchanged spears, and the boy soon found
himself married to Chenda&rsquo;s eldest daughter. With his second-mother
still <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> to him. He tried to give her to his wife
as part of his bride gift, and both women claimed he was trying to
rob them of honor. He nearly had to take his own wife as <em>
gai&rsquo;shain</em>. It came close to raiding between Haido and Jenda
again before the <em>toh</em> was discharged.&rdquo; The Aiel women
almost fell over laughing, Amys and Melaine wiping their eyes.</p>

<p>Egwene understood little of the story&mdash;certainly not why it was funny&mdash;but she managed a polite
laugh.</p>

<p>Moiraine set her water aside for the small silver cup
of wine. &ldquo;I have heard men speak of fighting the Aiel, but I have
never heard of this before. Certainly not of an Aiel surrendering
because he was touched.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not surrender,&rdquo; Amys said pointedly. &ldquo;It
is <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one would ask to be made <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> to a
wetlander,&rdquo; Melaine said. &ldquo;Outlanders do not know <em>of
ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aiel women exchanged looks. They were
uncomfortable. <em>Why?</em> Egwene wondered. <em>Oh</em>. To the
Aiel, not to know <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em> must be like not knowing
manners, or not being honorable. &ldquo;There are honorable men and women
among us,&rdquo; Egwene said. &ldquo;Most of us. We know right from wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you do,&rdquo; Bair murmured in a tone that said
that was not the same thing at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sent a letter to me in Tear,&rdquo; Moiraine said,
&ldquo;before I ever reached there. You said a great many things, some of
which have proven true. Including that I would&mdash;must&mdash;meet you here today; you very nearly commanded me to be here. Yet
earlier you said <em>if</em> I came. How much of what you wrote did
you know to be true?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amys sighed and set aside her cup of wine, but it was
Bair who spoke. &ldquo;Much is uncertain, even to a dream walker. Amys
and Melaine are the best of us, and even they do not see all that
is, or all that can be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The present is much clearer than the future even in
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod,</em>&rdquo; the sun-haired Wise One said. &ldquo;What <em>
is</em> happening or beginning is more easily seen than what <em>
will</em> happen, or <em>may</em>. We did not see Egwene or Mat
Cauthon at all. It was no more than an even chance that the young
man who calls himself Rand al&rsquo;Thor would come. If he did not, it
was certain that he would die, and the Aiel too. Yet he has come,
and if he survives Rhuidean, some of the Aiel at least will
survive. This we know. If you had not come, he would have died. If
<em>Aan&rsquo;allein</em> had not come, you would have died. If you do
not go through the rings&mdash;&rdquo; She cut off as if she had bitten
her tongue.</p>

<p>Egwene leaned forward intently. Moiraine had to enter
Rhuidean? But the Aes Sedai appeared to give no notice, and Seana
spoke up quickly to cover Melaine&rsquo;s slip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no one set path to the future. The Pattern
makes the finest lace look coarse-woven sacking, or tangled string.
In <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> it is possible to see some ways the
future may be woven. No more than that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine took a sip of wine. &ldquo;The Old Tongue is often
difficult to translate.&rdquo; Egwene stared at her. The Old Tongue? What
about the rings, the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>? But Moiraine went
blithely on. &ldquo;<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> means the World of Dreams, or
perhaps the Unseen World. Neither is really exact; it is more
complex than that. <em>Aan&rsquo;allein</em>. One Man, but also The Man
Who Is an Entire People, and two or three other ways to translate
it as well. And the words we have taken for common use, and never
think of their meanings in the Old Tongue. Warders are called
&lsquo;Gaidin,&rsquo; which was &lsquo;brothers to battle.&rsquo; Aes Sedai meant &lsquo;servant
of all.&rsquo; And &lsquo;Aiel&rsquo;. &lsquo;Dedicated,&rsquo; in the Old Tongue. Stronger than
that; it implies an oath written into your bones. I have often
wondered what the Aiel are dedicated to.&rdquo; The Wise Ones&rsquo; faces had
gone to iron, but Moiraine continued. &ldquo;And &lsquo;Jenn Aiel&rsquo;. &lsquo;The true
dedicated,&rsquo; but again stronger. Perhaps &lsquo;the only true dedicated.&rsquo;
The only true Aiel?&rdquo; She looked at them questioningly, just as if
they did not suddenly have eyes of stone. None of them spoke.</p>

<p>What was Moiraine doing? Egwene did not intend to
allow the Aes Sedai to ruin her chances of learning whatever the
Wise Ones could teach her. &ldquo;Amys, could we talk of Dreaming
now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tonight will be time enough,&rdquo; Amys said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tonight, Egwene. You may be Aes Sedai, but you must
become a pupil again. You cannot even go to sleep when you wish
yet, or sleep lightly enough to tell what you see before you wake.
When the sun begins to set, I will begin to teach you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ducking her head, Egwene peered under the edge of the
tent roof. From that deep shade, the light outside glared
piercingly through heat shimmers in the air; the sun stood no more
than halfway to the mountaintops.</p>

<p>Abruptly Moiraine rose to her knees; reaching behind
her, she began undoing her dress. &ldquo;I presume that I must go as
Aviendha did,&rdquo; she said, not as a question.</p>

<p>Bair gave Melaine a hard stare that the younger woman
met only for a moment before dropping her eyes. Seana said in a
resigned voice, &ldquo;You should not have been told. It is done, now.
Change. One not of the blood has gone to Rhuidean, and now
another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine paused. &ldquo;Does that make a difference, that I
have been told?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps a great difference,&rdquo; Bair said reluctantly,
&ldquo;perhaps none. We often guide, but we do not tell. When we saw you
go to the rings, each time it was you who brought up going, who
demanded the right though you have none of the blood. Now one of us
has mentioned it first. Already there are changes from anything we
saw. Who can say what they are?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what did you see if I do not go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bair&rsquo;s wrinkled face was expressionless, but sympathy
touched her pale blue eyes. &ldquo;We have told too much already,
Moiraine. What a dream walker sees is what is likely to happen, not
what surely will. Those who move with too much knowledge of the
future inevitably find disaster, whether from complacency at what
they think must come or in their efforts to change it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the mercy of the rings that the memories
fade,&rdquo; Amys said. &ldquo;A woman knows some things&mdash;a few&mdash;that will happen; others she will not recognize until the decision
is upon her, if then. Life is uncertainty and struggle, choice and
change; one who knew how her life was woven into the Pattern as
well as she knew how a thread was laid into a carpet would have the
life of an animal. If she did not go mad. Humankind is made for
uncertainty, struggle, choice and change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine listened with no outward show of impatience,
though Egwene suspected it was there; the Aes Sedai was used to
lecturing, not being lectured. She was silent while Egwene helped
her out of her dress, not speaking until she crouched naked at the
edge of the carpets, peering down the mountainside toward the
fog-shrouded city in the valley. Then she said, &ldquo;Do not let Lan follow
me. He will try, if he sees me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be as it will be,&rdquo; Bair replied. Her thin
voice sounded cold and final.</p>

<p>After a moment, Moiraine gave a grudging nod and
slipped out of the tent into the blazing sunlight. She began to run
immediately, barefoot down the scorching slope.</p>

<p>Egwene grimaced.
Rand and Mat, Aviendha, now Moiraine, all going into Rhuidean.
&ldquo;Will she&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;survive? If you dreamed of this, you must
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are some places one cannot enter in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>,&rdquo; Seana said. &ldquo;Rhuidean. Ogier <em>
stedding</em>. A few others. What happens there is shielded from a
dreamwalker&rsquo;s eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was not an answer&mdash;they could have seen
whether she came out of Rhuidean&mdash;but it was obviously all
she was going to get. &ldquo;Very well. Should I go, too?&rdquo; She did not
relish the thought of experiencing the rings; it would be like
being raised to Accepted again. But if everyone else was going&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not be foolish,&rdquo; Amys said vigorously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We saw nothing of this for you,&rdquo; Bair added in a
milder tone. &ldquo;We did not see you at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I would not say yes if you asked,&rdquo; Amys went on.
&ldquo;Four are required for permission, and I would say no. You are here
to learn to dreamwalk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; Egwene said, settling back on her
cushion, &ldquo;teach me. There must be something you can begin with
before tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Melaine frowned at her, but Bair chuckled dryly. &ldquo;She
is as eager and impatient as you were once you decided to learn,
Amys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amys nodded. &ldquo;I hope she can keep her eagerness and
lose the impatience, for her sake. Hear me, Egwene. Though it will
be hard, you must forget that you are Aes Sedai if you are to
learn. You must listen, remember, and do as you are told. Above
all, you must not enter <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> again until one of
us says you may. Can you accept this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It would not be hard to forget she was Aes Sedai when
she was not. For the rest, it sounded ominously like becoming a
novice again. &ldquo;I can accept it.&rdquo; She hoped she did not sound
doubtful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Bair said. &ldquo;I will now tell you about
dreamwalking and <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, in a very general way.
When I am done, you will repeat back to me what I have said. If you
fail to touch all points, you will scrub the pots in place of the
<em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> tonight. If your memory is so poor that you
cannot repeat what I say after a second hearing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Well, we
will discuss that when it happens. Attend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Almost anyone can touch <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, but
few can truly enter it. Of all the Wise Ones, we four alone can
dreamwalk, and your Tower has not produced a dreamwalker in nearly
five hundred years. It is not a thing of the One Power, though Aes
Sedai believe it is. I cannot channel, nor can Seana, yet we
dreamwalk as well as Amys or Melaine. Many people brush the World
of Dreams in their sleep. Because they only brush against it, they
wake with aches or pains where they should have broken bones or
mortal hurts. A dreamwalker enters the dream fully, therefore her
injuries are real on waking. For one who is fully in the dream,
dreamwalker or not, death there is death here. To enter the dream
too completely, though, is to lose touch with the flesh; there is
no way back, and the flesh dies. It is said that once there were
those who could enter the dream in the flesh, and no longer be in
this world at all. This was an evil thing, for they did evil; it
must never be attempted, even if you believe it possible for you,
for each time you will lose some part of what makes you human. You
must learn to enter <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> when you wish, to the
degree you wish. You must learn to find what you need to find and
read what you see, to enter the dreams of another close by in order
to aid healing, to recognize those who are in the dream fully
enough to harm you, to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene listened intently. It fascinated her, hinting
at things she had never suspected were possible, but beyond that
she had no intention of ending up scrubbing pots. It did not seem
fair, somehow. Whatever Rand and Mat and the others faced in
Rhuidean, they were not going to be sent off to scrub pots. <em>And
I</em> agreed <em>to it!</em> It just was not fair. But then, she
doubted they could get any more out of Rhuidean than she would from
these women.</p>
