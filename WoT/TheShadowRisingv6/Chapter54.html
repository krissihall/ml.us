<h4><em>Into the Palace</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">S</span>eated
on the tail end of the high-wheeled cart
trundling up a twisty Tanchican street behind four sweating men,
Elayne scowled through the grimy veil that covered her from eyes to
chin, kicking her bare feet irritably. Every lurch over the paving
stones jarred her to the top of her skull; the more she braced
herself by holding on to the rough wooden planks of the cart bed,
the worse it was. It did not seem to bother Nynaeve much; she
jounced about like Elayne, but, frowning slightly and eyes looking
inward, she appeared hardly aware of it. And Egeanin, crowded
against Nynaeve on the other side, veiled and with her dark hair in
braids to her shoulders, rode each jolt easily, arms folded.
Finally Elayne emulated the Seanchan woman; she could not avoid
swaying into Nynaeve, but the ride no longer felt as if her lower
teeth were going to be driven through the upper.</p>

<p>She would have walked gladly, even barefoot, but
Bayle Domon had said it would not look right; people might wonder
why women were not riding when there was plenty of room, and the
last thing they wanted was anyone thinking about them twice. Of
course he was not being bounced about like a sack of turnips; he
was walking, at the head of the cart with ten of the twenty sailors
he had brought along for escort. More would seem suspicious, he
claimed. She suspected he would not have had so many if not for her
and the other two women.</p>

<p>The cloudless sky still stretched gray overhead,
though first light had crept on before they set out; the streets
were still largely empty, and silent except for the rumble of the
cart and the creak of its axle. When the sun topped the horizon
people would begin to venture out, but now the few she saw were
knots of men in baggy trousers and dark cylindrical caps, scuttling
along with the furtive air of having been up to no good while dark
had held. The old piece of canvas tossed over the cart&rsquo;s load was
carefully arranged so anyone could see it covered only three large
baskets, yet even so one or another of those small clusters would
pause like a pack of dogs, veiled faces all coming up together,
eyes swiveling to follow the cart. Apparently twenty men with
boarding swords and cudgels were too many to face, because all
eventually hurried on.</p>

<p>The wheels dropped into a large hole where paving
stones had been pried up in one of the riots; the cart fell away
beneath her. She almost bit her tongue as she and the cart bed met
again with a hard smack. Egeanin and her casual arm-folding!
Grabbing the edge of the cart bed, she frowned at the Seanchan
woman. And found her tight-lipped and holding on with both hands
also.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite the same as standing on deck after all,&rdquo;
Egeanin said with a shrug.</p>

<p>Nynaeve grimaced slightly and tried to edge away from
the Seanchan woman, though how she might manage it without climbing
into Elayne&rsquo;s lap was difficult to see. &ldquo;I am going to speak to
Master Bayle Domon,&rdquo; she muttered meaningfully, just as if the cart
had not been her suggestion in the first place. Another lurch
clicked her teeth shut.</p>

<p>They all three wore drab brown wool, thin-woven but
coarse and not very clean, poor farm women&rsquo;s dresses like shapeless
sacks compared with the clinging silks of Rendra&rsquo;s taste. Refugees
from the countryside earning a meal as they could; that was what
they were supposed to be. Egeanin&rsquo;s relief at her first sight of
the dresses had been quite evident, and almost as strange as her
presence on the cart. Elayne would not have thought the latter
conceivable.</p>

<p>There had been quite a lot of discussion&mdash;that
was what the men called it&mdash;in the Chamber of Falling
Blossoms, but she and Nynaeve had countered most of their fool
objections and ignored the rest. The two of them had to enter the
Panarch&rsquo;s Palace, and as soon as possible. That was when Domon had
raised another objection, one not as silly as the rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can no go into the palace alone,&rdquo; the bearded
smuggler muttered, staring at his fists on the table. &ldquo;You say you
will no channel unless you must, no to warn these Black Aes Sedai.&rdquo;
Neither of them had seen any need to mention one of the Forsaken.
&ldquo;Then you must have muscle to swing a club if the need do arise,
and eyes to watch your backs will no be amiss either. I am known
there, to the servants. I did take gifts to the old Panarch too. I
will go with you.&rdquo; Shaking his head, he growled, &ldquo;You do make me
stretch my neck on the headsman&rsquo;s block because I did leave you at
Falme. Fortune prick me if you do no! Well, it do be done now; you
can no object to <em>this</em>! I will go in with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a fool, Illianer,&rdquo; Juilin said
contemptuously before she or Nynaeve could open their mouths. &ldquo;You
think the Taraboners will allow you to wander about the palace as
you wish? A scruffy smuggler from Illian? I know the ways of
servants, how to duck my head and make some empty-headed noble
think&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He cleared his throat hastily, and hurried on without
looking at Nynaeve&mdash;or at her! &ldquo;I should be the one to go
with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom laughed at the other two men. &ldquo;Do you think <em>
either</em> of you could pass for a Taraboner? I can; these will do
in a pinch.&rdquo; He knuckled his long mustaches. &ldquo;Besides, you cannot
run around the Panarch&rsquo;s Palace carrying cudgel or staff. A more&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;subtle&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;method of protection is needed.&rdquo; He flourished a
hand, and a knife suddenly appeared, spinning through his fingers
to vanish just as quickly; up his sleeve, Elayne believed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You all know what you have to do,&rdquo; Nynaeve snapped,
&ldquo;and you cannot do it trying to watch over us like a pair of geese
for market!&rdquo; Taking a deep breath, she went on, in a milder tone.
&ldquo;If there was a way one of you could come along, I&rsquo;d appreciate the
extra eyes if nothing else, but it cannot be. We have to go alone,
it seems, and that is all there is to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can accompany you,&rdquo; Egeanin announced suddenly
from where Nynaeve had made her stand in the corner of the room.
Everybody turned to look at her; she frowned back as though not
quite certain herself. &ldquo;These women are Darkfriends. They should be
brought to justice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne was simply startled at the offer, but Nynaeve,
the corners of her mouth going white, looked ready to drub the
woman for it. &ldquo;You think we would trust you, Seanchan?&rdquo; she said
coldly. &ldquo;Before we leave, you&rsquo;ll be locked securely in a storeroom
however much talk it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I give oath by my hope of a higher name,&rdquo; Egeanin
broke in, putting her hands over her heart, one atop the other,
&ldquo;that I will not betray you in any way, that I will obey you and
guard your backs until you are safely out of the Panarch&rsquo;s Palace.&rdquo;
Then she bowed three times, deeply and formally. Elayne had no idea
what &ldquo;hope of a higher name&rdquo; meant, but the Seanchan woman
certainly made it sound binding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She can do it,&rdquo; Domon said with slow reluctance. He
eyed Egeanin and shook his head. &ldquo;Fortune prick me if there be more
than two or three of my men I would wager on, coin for coin,
against her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve frowned at her hand gripping half a dozen of
her long braids, then quite deliberately gave them a yank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve,&rdquo; Elayne told her firmly, &ldquo;you yourself said
you would like another pair of eyes, and I definitely would.
Besides which, if we are to do this without channeling, I would not
mind having someone along who can handle a nosy guard if need be. I
am not up to thumping men with my fists, and neither are you. You
remember how she can fight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve glared at Egeanin, frowned at Elayne, and
then stared at the men as if they had plotted this behind her back.
At last, though, she nodded,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;Master Domon, that means three
sets of dresses, not two. Now, the three of you had best be off. We
want to be on our way by daybreak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cart jerking to a halt brought Elayne out of her
reverie.</p>

<p>Dismounted Whitecloaks were questioning Domon. Here
the street ran into a square behind the Panarch&rsquo;s Palace, a much
smaller square than the one in front. Beyond, the palace stood in
piles of white marble, slender towers banded with lacy stonework,
snowy domes capped with gold and topped by golden spires or weather
vanes. The streets to either side were much wider than most in
Tanchico, and straighter.</p>

<p>The slow <em>clop-clop</em> of a horse&rsquo;s hooves on
the square&rsquo;s broad paving stones announced another rider, a tall
man in burnished helmet, armor gleaming beneath his white cloak
with its golden sunburst and crimson shepherd&rsquo;s crook. Elayne put
her head down; the four knots of rank under the flaring sun told
her this was Jaichim Carridin. The man had never seen her, but if
he thought she was staring he might wonder why. The hooves passed
on along the square without pausing.</p>

<p>Egeanin had her face right down, too, but Nynaeve
frowned openly after the Inquisitor. &ldquo;That man is very worried
about something,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I hope he&rsquo;s not heard&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Panarch is dead!&rdquo; a man&rsquo;s voice shouted from
somewhere across the square. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve killed her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no telling who had shouted, or where. The
streets Elayne could see were blocked by Whitecloaks on horses.</p>

<p>Looking back down the street the cart had just
climbed, she wished the guards would question Domon more quickly.
People were gathering down at the first bend, milling about and
peering up toward the square. It seemed Thom and Juilin had made a
good job of seeding their rumors during the night. Now if only
things did not erupt while they sat out here in the middle of it.
If a riot started now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The only thing that kept her hands from
shaking was her double grip on the cart bed. <em>Light, a mob out
here and the Black Ajah inside, maybe Moghedien</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>I&rsquo;m
so frightened my mouth is dry</em>. Nynaeve and Egeanin were
watching the crowd growing down the street, too, and not even
blinking, much less trembling. <em>I will not be a coward. I will
not!</em></p>

<p>The cart rumbled forward, and she heaved a sigh of
relief. It took her a moment to realize she had heard twin echoes
from the other two women.</p>

<p>Before gates not much wider than the cart Domon was
questioned again, by men in pointed helmets, their breastplates
embossed with a tree painted gold. Soldiers of the Panarch&rsquo;s
Legion. The questions were shorter this time; Elayne thought she
saw a small purse change hands, and then they were inside, rumbling
across the rough-paved yard outside the kitchens. Except for Domon,
the sailors remained out with the soldiers.</p>

<p>Elayne hopped down as soon as the cart halted,
working her bare feet on the paving; the uneven stones were <em>
hard</em>. It was difficult to believe the thin sole of a slipper
could make so much difference. Egeanin scrambled up into the cart
to pass the baskets out, Nynaeve taking the first on her back, one
hand twisted behind her underneath, the other over her shoulder to
grip the rim. Long white peppers, a little wizened by their journey
all the way from Saldaea, filled the baskets nearly to the top.</p>

<p>As Elayne was taking hers, Domon came to the end of
the cart and pretended to inspect the ice peppers. &ldquo;The Whitecloaks
and the Panarch&rsquo;s Legion do be close to blows, it do appear,&rdquo; he
murmured, fingering peppers. &ldquo;That lieutenant did say the Legion
could protect the Panarch themselves if most of the Legion had no
been sent to the ring forts. Jaichim Carridin do have access to the
Panarch, but no the Lord Captain of the Legion. And they are no
pleased that all the guards inside do be Civil Watch. A suspicious
man might say someone do want the Panarch&rsquo;s guards to watch each
other more than anything else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is good to know,&rdquo; Nynaeve murmured without
looking at him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always said you can learn useful things
listening to men&rsquo;s gossip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Domon grunted sourly. &ldquo;I will take you inside; then I
must go back to my men to make sure they do no get caught up in the
mob.&rdquo; Every sailor from every ship Domon had in port was out in the
streets around the palace.</p>

<p>Hefting her own basket on her back, Elayne followed
the other two women behind him, keeping her head down and wincing
at every step until she was on the reddish-brown tiles of the
kitchen. The smells of spices and cooking meat and sauces filled
the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ice peppers for the Panarch,&rdquo; Domon announced. &ldquo;A
gift from Bayle Domon, a good shipowner of this city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More of the ice peppers?&rdquo; a stout, dark-braided
woman in a white apron and the ever-present veil said, barely
looking up from a silver tray where she was arranging an ornately
folded white napkin among dishes of thin, golden Sea Folk
porcelain. There were a dozen or more aproned women in the kitchen,
as well as a pair of boys turning dripping roasts on spits in two
of the six fireplaces, but clearly she was the chief cook. &ldquo;Well,
the Panarch, she seems to have enjoyed the last. Into the storeroom
there.&rdquo; She gestured vaguely toward one of the doors on the far
side of the room. &ldquo;I have no time to bother with you now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne kept her eyes on the floor as she trailed
after Nynaeve and Egeanin, sweating, and not for the heat of the
iron stoves and fireplaces. A skinny woman in green silk not of
Tarabon cut stood beside one of the wide tables, scratching the
ears of a scrawny gray cat as it lapped cream from a porcelain
dish. The cat named her, as well as her narrow face and wide nose.
Marillin Gemalphin, once of the Brown Ajah, now of the Black. If
she looked up from that cat, if she really became aware of them,
there would be no need for channeling for her to know that two of
them could; this close the woman would be able to sense the ability
itself.</p>

<p>Sweat dripped from the end of Elayne&rsquo;s nose by the
time she pushed the storeroom door shut behind her with a hip. &ldquo;Did
you see her?&rdquo; she demanded in a low voice, letting her basket
half-fall to the floor. Fretwork carved through the plastered wall
just under the ceiling let in dim light from the kitchen. Rows of
tall shelves filled the floor of the large room, laden with sacks
and net bags of vegetables and large jars of spice. Barrels and
casks stood everywhere, and a dozen dressed lambs and twice as many
geese hung on hooks. According to the sketchy floorplan Domon and
Thom had drawn between them, this was the smallest storeroom for
food in the palace. &ldquo;This is disgusting,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I know Rendra
keeps a full kitchen, but at least she buys what she needs as she
can. These people have been feasting while&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold your concern until you can do something about
it,&rdquo; Nynaeve told her in a sharp whisper. She had upended her
basket on the floor and was stripping off her rough farm woman&rsquo;s
dress. Egeanin was already down to her shift. &ldquo;I did see her. If
you want her to come in here to see what the noise is about, keep
talking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne sniffed, but let it pass. She had not been
making that much noise. Pulling off her own dress, she dumped the
peppers out of her basket, and what had been hidden under them as
well. Among other things, a dress of white belted in green,
fine-spun wool embroidered above the left breast with a green tree
of spreading branches atop the outline of a trefoil leaf. Her grimy
veil was replaced by a clean one, of linen scraped nearly as sheer
as silk. White slippers with padded soles were welcome on feet
bruised by that walk from cart to kitchen.</p>

<p>The Seanchan woman had been the first out of her old
clothes, but she was the last into her white garment, muttering all
the while about &ldquo;indecent&rdquo; and &ldquo;serving girl,&rdquo; which made no sense.
The dresses <em>were</em> servants&rsquo; dresses; the whole point was
that servants could go anywhere and a palace had too many for
anyone to notice three more. And as for indecent&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Elayne could
remember being a touch hesitant about wearing the Tarabon style in
public, but she had become used to it soon enough, and even this
thin wool could not cling as silk did. Egeanin seemed to have very
strict ideas of modesty.</p>

<p>Eventually, though, the woman had done up her last
lace, and the farm clothes had been stuffed into the baskets and
covered with ice peppers.</p>

<p>Marillin Gemalphin was gone from the kitchen, though
the raggedy-eared gray cat still lapped cream on the table. Elayne
and the other two started for the door that led deeper into the
palace.</p>

<p>One of the undercooks was frowning at the cat, fist
on her ample hips. &ldquo;I would like to strangle this cat,&rdquo; she
muttered, pale brown braids swinging as she shook her head angrily.
&ldquo;It eats the cream, and because I put the drop of cream on the
berries for my breakfast, I have the bread and water for my
meals!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Count yourself lucky you are not out in the street,
or swinging from the gallows.&rdquo; The chief cook did not sound
sympathetic. &ldquo;If a lady says you have stolen, then you have stolen,
even if it is the cream for her cats, yes? You, there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne and her companions froze at the shout.</p>

<p>The dark-braided woman shook a long wooden spoon at
them. &ldquo;You come into my kitchen and stroll about as in the garden,
you lazy sows you? You have come for the breakfast of the Lady
Ispan, yes? If you do not have it there when she wakes, you will
learn how to jump. Well?&rdquo; She gestured at the silver tray she had
been laboring over before, covered now with a snowy linen
cloth.</p>

<p>There was no way to speak; if any one of them opened
her mouth, her first words would show her no Taraboner. Thinking
quickly, Elayne bobbed a servant&rsquo;s curtsy and picked up the tray; a
servant carrying something was going about her work and not likely
to be stopped or told to do something else. Lady Ispan? Not an
uncommon name in Tarabon, but there was an Ispan on the list of
Black sisters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you mock me, do you, you little cow you?&rdquo; the
stout woman roared, and started around the table waving her thick
wooden spoon threateningly.</p>

<p>There was nothing to do without giving herself away;
nothing but stay and be hit, or run. Elayne darted out of the
kitchen with the tray, Nynaeve and Egeanin at her heels. The cook&rsquo;s
shouts followed them, but not the cook, thankfully. An image of the
three of them running through the palace pursued by the stout woman
made Elayne want to giggle hysterically. <em>Mock her?</em> She was
sure that had been exactly the same curtsy servants had given her
thousands of times.</p>

<p>More storerooms lined the narrow hallway leading away
from the kitchen, and tall cupboards for brooms and mops, buckets
and soaps, linens for tables, and all sorts of assorted things.
Nynaeve found a fat feather duster in one. Egeanin took an armful
of folded towels from another, and a stout stone pestle out of a
mortar in a third. She hid the pestle under the towels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A cudgel is sometimes handy,&rdquo; she said when Elayne
raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;Especially when no one expects you to have
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve sniffed but said nothing. She had hardly
acknowledged Egeanin at all since agreeing to her presence.</p>

<p>Deeper in the palace the hallways broadened and
heightened, the white walls carved with friezes and the ceilings
set with gleaming arabesques of gold. Long, bright carpets ran
along white-tiled floors. Ornate golden lamps on gilded stands gave
light and the scent of perfumed oil. Sometimes the corridor opened
into courtyards rounded by walks with slim, fluted columns,
overlooked by balconies screened by filigreed stonework. Large
fountains burbled; fish red and white and golden swam beneath lily
pads with huge white flowers. Not at all like the city outside.</p>

<p>Occasionally they saw other servants, men and women,
in white, tree and leaf embroidered on one shoulder, hurrying about
their tasks, or men in the gray coats and steel caps of the Civil
Watch carrying staffs or cudgels. No one spoke to them or even
looked twice, not at three serving women obviously at their
work.</p>

<p>At last they came to the narrow servants&rsquo; stairs
marked on their sketchy map.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; Nynaeve said quietly, &ldquo;if there are
guards on her door, leave. If she is not alone, leave. She is far
from the most important reason we are here.&rdquo; She took a deep
breath, making herself look at Egeanin. &ldquo;If you let anything happen
to her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A trumpet sounded faintly from outside. A moment
later a gong rang inside, and shouted orders drifted down the hall.
Men in steel caps appeared for a moment down the hallway,
running.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe we will not have to worry about guards on her
door,&rdquo; Elayne said. The riot had begun in the streets. Rumors
spread by Thom and Juilin to gather the crowd. Domon&rsquo;s sailors to
egg them on. She regretted the necessity, but the disturbance would
pull most of the guards out of the palace, maybe all with luck.
Those people out there did not know it, but they fought in a battle
to save their city from the Black Ajah and the world from the
Shadow. &ldquo;Egeanin should go with you, Nynaeve. Your part <em>is</em>
the most important. If one of us needs someone to watch her back,
it is you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no need for a Seanchan!&rdquo; Shouldering her duster
like a pike, Nynaeve strode off down the hall. She really did not
move like a servant. Not with that militant stride.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Should we not be about our own task?&rdquo; Egeanin said.
&ldquo;The riot will not hold attention completely for long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne nodded. Nynaeve had passed out of sight around
a corner.</p>

<p>The stairs were narrow and hidden in the wall, to
keep servants as unseen as possible. The corridors on the second
floor were much as those on the first, except that double-pointed
arches were almost as likely to give onto a stone-latticed balcony
as onto a room. There seemed to be far fewer servants as they made
their way to the west side of the palace, and none more than
glanced at them. Wonderfully, the hallway outside the Panarch&rsquo;s
apartments was empty. No guards in front of the wide, tree-carved
doors set in a double-peaked frame. Not that she had meant to
retreat had there been guards, no matter what she had told Nynaeve,
but it did make things simpler.</p>

<p>A moment later she was not so sure. She could feel
someone channeling in those rooms. Not strong flows, but definitely
the Power being woven, or maybe a weave maintained. Few women knew
the trick of tying a weave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; Egeanin asked.</p>

<p>Elayne realized she had stopped. &ldquo;One of the Black
sisters is in there.&rdquo; One, or more? Only one channeling, certainly.
She pressed close to the doors. A woman was <em>singing</em> in
there. She put her ear to the carved wood, heard raucous words,
muffled yet clearly understandable.</p>

<p class="verse_quote">&ldquo;My breasts are round, and my hips are too.<br>
I can flatten a whole ship&rsquo;s crew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Startled, she jerked back, porcelain dishes sliding
on the tray under the cloth. Had she somehow come to the wrong
room? No, she had memorized the sketch. Besides, in the entire
palace the only doors carved with the tree led to the Panarch&rsquo;s
apartments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we must leave her,&rdquo; Egeanin said. &ldquo;You can do
nothing without warning the others of your presence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I can. If they feel me channel, they will
think it is whoever is in there.&rdquo; Frowning, she bit her lower lip.
How many were there? She could do at least three or four things at
once with the Power, something only Egwene and Nynaeve could match.
She ran down a list of Andoran queens who had shown courage in the
face of great danger, until she realized it was a list of all the
queens of Andor. <em>I will be queen one day; I can be as brave as
they</em>. Readying herself, she said, &ldquo;Throw open the doors,
Egeanin, then drop down so I can see everything.&rdquo; The Seanchan
woman hesitated. &ldquo;Throw open the doors.&rdquo; Elayne&rsquo;s own voice
surprised her. She had not tried to <em>make</em> it anything, but
it was quiet, calm, commanding. And Egeanin nodded, almost a bow,
and immediately flung open both doors.</p>

<p class="verse_quote">&ldquo;My thighs are strong are strong as anchor chain.<br>
My kiss can burst&mdash;</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dark-braided singer, standing wrapped in flows of
Air to her neck and a soiled, wrinkled Taraboner gown of red silk,
cut off short as the doors banged back. A frail-appearing woman,
lounging in pale blue of a high-necked Cairhienin cut on a long
padded bench, ceased nodding her head to the song and leaped to her
feet, outrage replacing the grin on her fox-shaped face.</p>

<p>The glow of <em>saidar</em> already surrounded
Temaile, but she did not have a chance. Appalled at what she saw,
Elayne embraced the True Source and lashed out hard with flows of
Air, webbing her from shoulders to ankles, wove a shield of Spirit
and slammed it between the woman and the Source. The glow around
Temaile vanished, and she went flying across the bench as if she
had been struck by a galloping horse, eyes rolling up into her
head, to land unconscious on her back three paces away on the
green-and-gold carpet. The dark-braided woman gave a start as the
flows around her winked out of existence, felt at herself in
wondering disbelief as she stared from Temaile to Elayne and
Egeanin.</p>

<p>Tying off the weave holding Temaile, Elayne hurried
into the room, eyes searching for others of the Black Ajah. Behind
her, Egeanin closed the doors after them. There did not seem to be
anyone else. &ldquo;Was she alone?&rdquo; she demanded of the woman in red. The
Panarch, by Nynaeve&rsquo;s description. Nynaeve <em>had</em> mentioned
<em>some</em>thing about a song.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;with them?&rdquo; Amathera said
hesitantly, dark eyes taking in their dresses. &ldquo;You are Aes Sedai
also?&rdquo; She seemed willing to doubt that despite the evidence of
Temaile. &ldquo;But not with them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was she alone?&rdquo; Elayne snapped, and Amathera gave a
little jump.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Alone. Yes, she&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; The Panarch grimaced.
&ldquo;The others made me sit on my throne and speak the words they put
into my mouth. It amused them to make me sometimes give justice,
and sometimes pronouncements of horrible injustice, rulings that
will cause strife for generations if I cannot put them aright. But
her!&rdquo; That full-lipped little mouth opened in a snarl. &ldquo;Her they
set to watch over me. She hurts me for no reason except to make me
weep. She made me eat an entire trayful of white ice peppers and
would not let me drink a drop until I begged on my knees while she
laughed! In my dreams she hoists me to the top of the Tower of
Morning by my ankles and lets me fall. A dream, but it seems real,
and each time she lets me fall screaming a little nearer the
ground. And she laughs! She makes me learn lewd dances, and filthy
songs, and laughs when she tells me that before they leave she will
make me sing and dance to entertain the&mdash;&rdquo; With a shriek like
a pouncing cat she threw herself across the bench onto the bound
woman, slapping wildly, pummeling with her fists.</p>

<p>Egeanin, arms folded in front of the doors, seemed
ready to let it go on, but Elayne wove flows of Air around
Amathera&rsquo;s waist. To her surprise she was able to lift her off the
already senseless woman and set her on her feet. Perhaps learning
how to handle those heavy weavings from Jorin had increased her
strength.</p>

<p>Amathera kicked at Temaile, turning her glare on
Elayne and Egeanin when her slippered feet missed. &ldquo;I am the
Panarch of Tarabon, and I mean to dispense justice to this woman!&rdquo;
That rosebud mouth had a very sulky look. Had the woman no sense of
herself, of her position? She was equal to the king, a ruler!</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I am the Aes Sedai who has come to rescue you,&rdquo;
Elayne said coolly. Realizing she still held the tray, she set it
on the floor hurriedly. The woman seemed to be having enough
trouble seeing beyond the white servants&rsquo; dresses without that.
Temaile&rsquo;s face was quite red; she would wake to bruises. No doubt
fewer than she deserved. Elayne wished there was a way to take
Temaile with them. A way to bring even one to justice in the Tower.
&ldquo;We have come&mdash;at considerable risk!&mdash;to take you out
of here. Then you can reach the Lord Captain of the Panarch&rsquo;s
Legion, and Andric and his army, and you can chase these women out.
Perhaps we will be lucky enough to take some of them for trial. But
first we must get you away from them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not need Andric,&rdquo; Amathera muttered. Elayne
would have sworn she almost said &ldquo;now.&rdquo; &ldquo;There are soldiers of my
Legion around the palace. I know this. I have been allowed to speak
to none of them, but once they see me, and hear my voice, they will
do what must be done, yes? You Aes Sedai cannot use the One Power
to harm&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She trailed off, scowling at the unconscious
Temaile. &ldquo;You cannot use it as a weapon, at least, yes? I know
this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne surprised herself by weaving tiny flows of
Air, one to each of Amathera&rsquo;s braids. The braids lifted straight
up into the air, and the pouty-mouth fool had no choice but to
follow them up on tiptoe. Elayne walked her that way, on tiptoe,
until the woman stood right in front of her, dark eyes wide and
indignant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will listen to me, Panarch Amathera of Tarabon,&rdquo;
she said in icy tones. &ldquo;If you try to walk out to your soldiers,
Temaile&rsquo;s cronies may very well tie you up in a bundle and hand you
back to her. Worse, they will learn that my friends and I are here,
and that I will not allow. We are going to <em>creep</em> out of
here, and if you will not agree to that, I&rsquo;ll bind and gag you and
leave you beside Temaile for her friends to find.&rdquo; There <em>
had</em> to be some way to take Temaile, too. &ldquo;Do you understand
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amathera nodded slightly, held up as she was. Egeanin
made an approving sound.</p>

<p>Elayne loosed the flows; the woman&rsquo;s heels dropped to
the carpet. &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s see if we can find you something to wear
that is suitable for sneaking.&rdquo; Amathera nodded again, but her
mouth was set at its sulkiest. Elayne hoped Nynaeve was having an
easier time of it.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Nynaeve entered the great exhibition hall with its
multitude of thin columns, feather duster already moving. This
collection must always need dusting, and surely no one would look
twice at a woman doing what was needed. She looked around, eyes
drawn to wired-together bones that looked like a long-legged horse
with a neck that pushed its skull up twenty feet. The vast chamber
stretched emptily in all directions.</p>

<p>But someone could come in at any moment; servants who
actually had been sent to clean, or Liandrin and all of her fellows
come to search. Still holding the duster prominently, just in case,
she hurried down to the white stone pedestal that had held the dull
black collar and bracelets. She did not realize she had been
holding her breath until she exhaled on seeing the things still
there. The glass-sided table holding the <em>cuendillar</em> seal
lay another fifty paces on, but this came first.</p>

<p>Climbing over the wrist-thick white silk rope, she
touched the wide, jointed collar. <em>Suffering. Agony. Woe</em>.
They rolled through her; she wanted to weep. What kind of thing
could absorb all that pain? Pulling her hand back, she glared at
the black metal. Meant to control a man who could channel. Liandrin
and her Black sisters meant to use it to control Rand, turn him to
the Shadow, force him to serve the Dark One. Someone from her
village, controlled and used by Aes Sedai! Black Ajah, but Aes
Sedai as surely as Moiraine with her scheming! <em>Egeanin, making
me like a filthy Seanchan!</em></p>

<p>The sudden incongruity of the last thought hit her;
abruptly she realized she was deliberately making herself angry,
angry enough to channel. She embraced the Source; the Power filled
her. And a serving woman with the tree-and-leaf on her shoulder
entered the columned hall.</p>

<p>Quivering with the urge to channel, Nynaeve waited,
even lifting the duster, running the feathers over the collar and
bracelets. The serving woman started down the pale floorstones; she
would go in a moment, and Nynaeve could&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;What? Slip the things
into her belt pouch and take them, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The serving woman would go? <em>Why did I think
she&rsquo;ll leave instead of staying to work?</em> She glanced sideways
up the room at the woman coming toward her. Of course. No broom or
mop, no feather duster, not even a rag. <em>Whatever she&rsquo;s here
for, it cannot take lo&mdash;</em></p>

<p>Suddenly she saw the woman&rsquo;s face clearly. Sturdily
handsome, framed by dark braids, smiling in an almost friendly
fashion but not really paying her any mind. Certainly not
threatening in any way. Not quite the same face, but she knew
it.</p>

<p>Before thought she struck out, weaving a hammer-hard
flow of Air to smash that face. In an instant the glow of <em>
saidar</em> surrounded the other women, her features changed&mdash;somehow more regal now, prouder, Moghedien&rsquo;s face remembered; and
startled as well, surprised that she had not approached unsuspected&mdash;and Nynaeve&rsquo;s flow was sliced razor clean. She staggered
under the whiplash recoil, like a physical blow, and the Forsaken
struck with a complex weave of Spirit streaked by Water and Air.
Nynaeve had no idea what it was meant to do; frantically she tried
to cut it as she had seen the other woman do, with a keen-edged
weave of Spirit. For a heartbeat she felt love, devotion, worship
for the magnificent woman who would deign to allow her to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The intricate weave parted, and Moghedien missed a
step. A tinge remained in Nynaeve&rsquo;s mind, like a fresh memory of
wanting to obey, to grovel and please, what had happened at their
first meeting all over again; it heated her rage. The knife-sharp
shield that Egwene had used to still Amico Nagoyin sprang into
being, more weapon than shield, lashed at Moghedien&mdash;and was
blocked, woven Spirit straining against woven Spirit, just short of
severing Moghedien from the Source forever. Again the Forsaken&rsquo;s
counterblow came, slashing like an axe, intended to cut Nynaeve off
in the same way. Forever. Desperately Nynaeve blocked it.</p>

<p>Suddenly she realized that under her anger she was
terrified. Holding off the other woman&rsquo;s attempt to still her while
trying to do the same to her took everything she had. The Power
boiled in her till she thought she must burst; her knees quivered
with the effort of standing. And all went into those two things;
she could not spare enough to light a candle. Moghedien&rsquo;s axe of
Spirit waxed and waned in sharpness, but that would not matter if
the woman managed to drive it home; Nynaeve could not see any real
difference in outcome between being stilled by the woman and merely&mdash;<em>merely!</em>&mdash;being shielded and at her mercy. The
thing brushed against the flow of Power from the Source into her,
like a knife hovering over a chicken&rsquo;s stretched neck. The image
was all too apt; she wished she had not thought of it. In the back
of her mind a tiny voice gibbered at her. <em>Oh, Light, don&rsquo;t let
her. Don&rsquo;t let her! Light, please, not that!</em></p>

<p>For a moment she considered letting go her own
attempt to cut Moghedien off&mdash;for one thing, she had to keep
forcing it back to a razor edge; the woven flows did not want to
hold the keenness&mdash;letting go and using that strength to
force Moghedien&rsquo;s attack further back, maybe sever it. But if she
tried, the other woman would not need to defend; she could add that
strength to her own attack. And she was one of the Forsaken. Not
just a Black sister. A woman who had been Aes Sedai in the Age of
Legends, when Aes Sedai had been able to do things undreamed of
now. If Moghedien threw her whole strength at her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A man who came in then, or any woman unable to
channel, would have seen only two women facing each other across
the white silk rope from a distance of less than ten feet. Two
women staring at one another in a vast hall full of strange things.
They would have seen nothing to say it was a duel. No leaping about
and hacking with swords as men would do, nothing smashed or broken.
Just two women standing there. But a duel all the same, and maybe
to the death. Against one of the Forsaken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All my careful planning ruined,&rdquo; Moghedien said
abruptly in a tight, angry voice, white-knuckled hands gripping her
skirts. &ldquo;At the very least I shall have to go to untold effort to
put everything back as it was. It may not be possible. Oh, I do
mean to make you pay for that, Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara. This has been such
a cozy hiding place, and those blind women have a number of very
useful items in their possession even if they do not&mdash;&rdquo; She
shook her head, lips peeling back to bare her teeth in a snarl. &ldquo;I
think I will take you with me this time. I know. I shall keep you
for a live mounting block. You will be brought out to kneel on all
fours so I can step from your back to my saddle. Or perhaps I shall
give you to Rahvin. He always repays favors. He does have a pretty
little queen to amuse him now, but pretty women were always
Rahvin&rsquo;s weakness. He likes to have two or three or four at once
dancing attendance on him. How will you like that? To spend the
rest of your life competing for Rahvin&rsquo;s favors. You will want to,
once he has his hands on you; he has his little tricks. Yes, I do
believe Rahvin shall have you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anger welled up in Nynaeve. Sweat streamed down her
face, and her legs shook as if they might give way, but anger gave
her strength. Furious, she managed to push her weapon of Spirit a
hair closer to severing Moghedien from the Source before the woman
halted it again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you discovered that little gem behind you,&rdquo;
Moghedien said in a moment of precarious balance. Surprisingly, her
voice was almost conversational. &ldquo;I wonder how you did that. It
does not matter. Did you come to take it away? Perhaps to destroy
it? You cannot destroy it. That is not metal, but a form of <em>
cuendillar</em>. Even balefire cannot destroy <em>cuendillar</em>.
And if you mean to use it, it does have&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;drawbacks, shall we
say? Put the collar on a man who channels, and a woman wearing the
bracelets can make him do whatever she wishes, true, but it will
not stop him going mad, and there is a flow the other way, too.
Eventually he will begin to be able to control you, too, so you end
with a struggle at every hour. Not very palatable when he is going
mad. Of course, you can pass the bracelets around, so no one has
too much exposure, but that does mean trusting someone else with
him. Men are always so good at violence; they make wonderful
weapons. Or two women can each wear one bracelet, if you have
someone you trust enough; that slows the seepage considerably, I
understand, but it also lessens your control, even if you work in
perfect unison. Eventually, you will find yourselves in a struggle
for control with him, each of you needing him to remove your
bracelet as surely as he needs you to remove the collar.&rdquo; She
tilted her head, lifted a quizzical eyebrow. &ldquo;You are following
this, I trust? Controlling Lews Therin&mdash;Rand al&rsquo;Thor as he is
called now&mdash;would be most useful, but is it worth the price?
You can see why I have left the collar and bracelets where they
are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trembling to contain the Power, to hold her woven
flows, Nynaeve frowned. Why was the woman telling her all of this?
Did she think it did not matter because she was going to win? Why
her sudden change from rage to talk? There was sweat on Moghedien&rsquo;s
face, too. Quite a lot of sweat, beading
on her broad forehead, running down her cheeks.</p>

<p>Suddenly everything changed in Nynaeve&rsquo;s mind.
Moghedien&rsquo;s was not a voice tight with anger; it was a voice tight
with strain. Moghedien was not suddenly going to hurl all of her
strength at her; she already was. The woman was putting out as much
effort as she. She was facing one of the Forsaken, and far from
being plucked like a goose for supper, she had not lost a feather.
She was meeting one of the Forsaken, strength for strength!
Moghedien was trying to distract her, to gain an opening before her
own strength gave out! If only she could do the same. Before her
strength went.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you wonder how I know all this? The collar and
bracelets were made after I was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Well, we will not talk of
that. Once I was free, the first thing I did was seek information
about those last days. Last years, really. There are a good many
fragments here and there that make no sense to anyone who does not
have some idea to begin with. The Age of Legends. Such a quaint
name you have given my time. Yet even your wildest tales no more
than hint at the half. I had lived over two hundred years when the
Bore was opened, and I was still young, for an Aes Sedai. Your
&lsquo;legends&rsquo; are but pale imitations of what we could do. Why&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve stopped listening. A way to distract the
woman. Even if she could think of something to say, Moghedien would
be on her guard against the method she herself was using. She could
not spare effort for as much as a thread-thin weave, any more than&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;any more than Moghedien could. A woman from the Age of
Legends, a woman long used to wielding the One Power. Perhaps used
to doing almost everything with the Power before she was
imprisoned. In hiding since being freed, how used to doing things
without the Power had she become?</p>

<p>Nynaeve let her legs sag. Dropping the feather
duster, she caught hold of the pedestal to support herself. There
was very little fakery needed.</p>

<p>Moghedien smiled and took a step nearer. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;travel to other worlds, even worlds in the sky. Do you know that
the stars are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; So sure, that smile. So triumphant.</p>

<p>Nynaeve seized the collar, ignoring the joltingly
pained emotions that spilled into her, and hurled it, all in one
motion.</p>

<p>The Forsaken had only begun to gape when the wide
black circlet struck her between the eyes. Not a hard blow,
certainly not enough to stun, but not expected, either. Moghedien&rsquo;s
control over her woven flows faltered, just slightly, only for an
instant. Yet for that instant the balance between them shifted. The
shield of Spirit slid between Moghedien and the Source; the halo
surrounding her winked out.</p>

<p>The woman&rsquo;s eyes bulged. Nynaeve expected her to leap
for her throat; that was what she would have done. Instead,
Moghedien jerked her skirts to her knees and ran.</p>

<p>With no need to defend herself, it took only a little
effort for Nynaeve to weave Air around the fleeing woman. The
Forsaken froze in midstride.</p>

<p>Hurriedly Nynaeve tied her weaving. She had done it.
<em>I faced one of the Forsaken and beat her</em>, she thought
incredulously. Looking at the woman held from the neck down by air
with the consistency of stone, even seeing her leaning forward on
one foot, it was hard to believe. Examining what she had done, she
saw it had not been as complete a victory as she had wanted. The
shield had blurred its sharp edge before it slid home. Moghedien
was captured and shielded, but not stilled.</p>

<p>Trying not to totter, she walked around in front of
the other woman. Moghedien still looked queenly, but like a very
frightened queen, licking her lips, eyes darting wildly. &ldquo;If&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;if you f-free me, we can c-come to s-some arrangement. There is
m-much I can t-teach you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ruthlessly Nynaeve cut her off, weaving a gag of Air
that held the woman&rsquo;s jaws gaping. &ldquo;A live mounting block. Wasn&rsquo;t
that what you said? I think that is a very good idea. I like to
ride.&rdquo; She smiled at the woman, whose eyes looked to be coming out
of her head.</p>

<p>Mounting block indeed! Once Moghedien had been put on
trial in the Tower and stilled&mdash;there could be no doubt of
the sentence for one of the Forsaken&mdash;she would surely be put
to some useful work in kitchens or gardens or stables, except when
she was brought out to show that even the Forsaken could not escape
justice, and treated no differently from any other servant, beyond
being watched. But let her think Nynaeve was as cruel as she. Let
her think it until she was actually put on&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s mouth twisted. Moghedien was not going to
be put on trial. Not now, anyway. Not unless she could figure out
some way to get her out of the Panarch&rsquo;s. Palace. The woman seemed
to believe the grimace portended something ill for her; tears
leaked from her eyes, and her mouth worked, trying to force words
past the gag.</p>

<p>Disgusted with herself, Nynaeve walked unsteadily
back to where the black collar lay, stuffing it quickly into her
belt pouch before the stark emotions in it could do more than touch
her. The bracelets followed, with the same feelings of suffering
and sorrow. <em>I was ready to torture her by letting her think I
would! She deserves it surely, but that is not me. Or is it? Am I
no better than Egeanin?</em></p>

<p>She jerked around, furious that she could even
consider such a question, and stalked past Moghedien to the
glass-walled table. There had to be some way to bring the woman to
justice.</p>

<p>There were seven figurines in the case. Seven, and no
seal.</p>

<p>For a moment she could only stare. One of the
figures, an odd animal shaped roughly like a pig but with a large
round snout and feet as wide as its thick legs, stood where the
seal had, in the center of the table. Suddenly her eyes narrowed.
It was not really there; the thing was woven from Air and Fire, in
flows so minute they made cobwebs seem cables. Even concentrating,
she could barely see them. She doubted if Liandrin or any of the
other Black sisters could have. A tiny, slicing flick of the Power,
and the fat animal vanished, in its place the black-and-white seal
on its red-lacquered stand. Moghedien, the hider, had hidden it in
plain sight. Fire melted a hole in the glass, and the seal went
into her pouch, too. It bulged now, and pulled her belt down.</p>

<p>Frowning at the woman poised on the toe of one
slipper, she tried to think of some means of taking her as well.
But Moghedien would not fit in her pouch, and she rather thought
that even if she could pick the other woman up, the sight might
raise a few eyebrows. Still, as she made her way to the nearest
arched doorway, she could not help looking back every other step.
If only there was some way. Pausing for one last, regretful look
from the doorway, she turned to go.</p>

<p>This door opened onto a courtyard with a fountain
full of lilypads. On the other side of the fountain, a slim,
coppery-skinned woman in a pale cream Taraboner dress that would
have made Rendra blush was just raising a fluted black rod a pace
in length. Nynaeve recognized Jeaine Caide. More, she recognized
the rod.</p>

<p>Desperately she flung herself to one side, so hard
that she slid along the smooth white floorstones until one of the
thin columns stopped her with a jar. A leg-thick bar of white shot
through where she had been standing, as if the air had turned to
molten metal, slicing all the way across the exhibition hall; where
it struck, pieces simply vanished out of columns, priceless
artifacts ceased to exist. Hurling flows of Fire behind her
blindly, hoping to strike something, anything, in the courtyard,
Nynaeve scrambled away across the hall on hands and knees. Little
more than waist-high, the bar sawed sideways, carving a swathe
through both walls; between, cases and cabinets and wired skeletons
collapsed and crashed. Severed columns quivered; some fell, but
what dropped onto that terrible sword did not survive to smash
displays and pedestals to the floor. The glass-walled table fell
before the molten shaft vanished, leaving a purplish bar that
seemed burned into Nynaeve&rsquo;s vision; the <em>cuendillar</em>
figures were all that dropped out of that molten white shaft,
bouncing on the floor.</p>

<p>The figurines did not break, of course. It seemed
Moghedien was right; not even balefire could destroy <em>
cuendillar</em>. That black rod was one of the stolen <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. Nynaeve could remember the warning appended to
their list in a firm hand. <em>Produces balefire. Dangerous and
almost impossible to control</em>.</p>

<p>Moghedien seemed to be trying to scream through her
invisible gag, head whipping back and forth in a frenzy as she
fought her bonds of Air, but Nynaeve spared her no more than a
glance. As soon as the balefire disappeared, she raised herself up
enough to peer back across the hall, through the rent sawed along
the chamber wall. Beside the fountain, Jeaine Caide was swaying,
one hand to her head, the black rod almost falling from the other.
But before Nynaeve could strike at her, she had clutched the fluted
rod again; balefire burst from its end, destroying everything in
its path through the chamber.</p>

<p>Dropping almost to her belly, Nynaeve crawled the
other way as fast as she could, amid the crash and clatter of
falling columns and masonry. Panting, she pulled herself into a
corridor slashed through both walls. There was no telling how far
the balefire had sliced; all the way out of the palace, perhaps.
Twisting about on a carpet littered with bits of stone, she peeked
cautiously around the side of the doorframe.</p>

<p>The balefire had gone again. Silence held in the
ruined exhibition hall, except when a weakened piece of stonework
gave way and smashed to the rubble-strewn floor. There was no sign
of Jeaine Caide, though enough of the far wall had fallen to show
the fountained courtyard clearly. She was not about to risk going
to see if the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> had killed the woman in using
it. Her breath came raggedly, and her arms and legs trembled enough
that she was glad to lie there a moment. Channeling took energy the
same as any other work; the more you did, the more energy. And the
wearier you were, the less you could channel. She was not entirely
certain she herself was up to facing even a weakened Jeaine Caide
right then.</p>

<p>Such a fool she had been. Battling Moghedien with the
Power, and never thinking that channeling that strong would have
every Black sister in the palace jumping out of her skin. She was
lucky the Domani woman had not arrived with her <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em> while she was still absorbed with the Forsaken.
They very likely both would have died before they knew she was
there.</p>

<p>Suddenly she stared in disbelief. Moghedien was gone!
The balefire had not come nearer than ten feet from where she had
stood, but she was not there any longer. It was impossible. She had
been shielded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do I know what&rsquo;s impossible?&rdquo; Nynaeve muttered.
&ldquo;It was impossible for me to beat one of the Forsaken, but I did
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still no sign of Jeaine Caide.</p>

<p>Pushing herself to her feet, she hurried for the
appointed meeting place. If only Elayne had not run into any
trouble, they might make it out here safely after all.</p>
