<h4><em>The Traps of Rhuidean</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">D</span>arkness
surrounded him once the door vanished,
blackness stretching in all directions, yet he could see. There was
no sensation of heat or cold, even wet as he was; no sensation at
all. Only existence. Plain gray stone steps rose in front of him,
each step hanging unsupported, arching out until they dwindled from
sight. He had seen these before, or their like; somehow he knew
they would take him where he had to go. He ran up the impossible
stairs, and as his boot left each one behind with its damp
footprint, it faded away, vanished. Only steps ahead waited, only
those taking him where he had to go. That was as it had been
before, too.</p>

<p><em>Did I</em> make <em>these with the Power, or do
they exist some other way?</em></p>

<p>With the thought, the gray stone under his foot began
to fade, and all the others ahead shimmered. Desperately he
concentrated on them, gray stone and real. Real! The shimmering
stopped. They were not so plain now, but polished, the edges carved
in a fancy border he thought he recalled seeing somewhere
before.</p>

<p>Not caring where&mdash;not sure he dared think too
long on it&mdash;he ran as hard as he could, taking the steps
three at a time through the endless dark. They would take him where
he wanted to go, but how long would it take? How much head start
did Asmodean have? Did the Forsaken know a faster way to travel?
That was the trouble. The Forsaken had all the knowledge; all he
had was desperation.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, he winced. The steps had accommodated
themselves to his long stride, with wide spaces between requiring
those leaps now, across black as deep as&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;as what? A fall here
might never end. He forced himself to ignore the gaps, to keep
running. The old, half-healed wound in his side began to throb, a
vague awareness. But if he was aware of it at all, wrapped inside
<em>saidin</em>, the wound was close to breaking open. <em>Ignore
it</em>. The thought floated across the Void inside him. He did not
dare lose this race, not if it killed him. Would these steps never
stop climbing? How far had he come?</p>

<p>Suddenly he saw a figure in the distance ahead and
off to his left, a man it seemed, in a red coat and red boots,
standing on a glistening silvery platform that slid through the
darkness. Rand needed no closer look to be sure it was Asmodean.
The Forsaken was not running like a half-spent country boy; he was
riding that whatever-it-was.</p>

<p>Rand stopped dead on one of the stone steps. He had
no idea what that platform was, shining like polished metal, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The steps ahead of him vanished. The piece of stone beneath his
boots began to glide forward, faster and faster. There was no wind
in his face to tell him he was moving, nothing in that vast black
to mark motion at all&mdash;except that he was beginning to catch
up to Asmodean. He did not know if he was doing this with the
Power; it just seemed to happen. The step wobbled and he made
himself stop wondering. <em>I don&rsquo;t know enough yet</em>.</p>

<p>The dark-haired man stood at his ease, one hand on a
hip, pensively fingering his chin. A spill of white lace dripped
from his neck; more half-hid his hands. His high-collared red coat
seemed shinier than silk satin, and was oddly cut, with
tails hanging almost to his knees. What seemed to be black threads,
like fine steel wires, ran off from the man, disappearing into the
surrounding dark. Those Rand had surely seen before.</p>

<p>Asmodean turned his head, and Rand gaped. The
Forsaken could change their faces&mdash;or at least make you see a
different face; he had seen Lanfear do it&mdash;but these were the
features of Jasin Natael, the gleeman. He had been sure it would be
Kadere, with his predatory eyes that never changed.</p>

<p>Asmodean saw him at the same moment and gave a start.
The Forsaken&rsquo;s silver perch darted forward&mdash;and suddenly a
huge sheet of fire, like a thin slice from a monstrous flame, swept
back toward Rand, a mile high and a mile wide.</p>

<p>He channeled at it desperately; just as it was about
to strike him, it suddenly burst into shards, hurtling away from
him, winking out. Yet even as the fiery curtain vanished it
revealed another rushing at him. He shattered that, exposing
another, splintered the third to reveal a fourth. Asmodean was
getting away, Rand was sure of it. He could not see the Forsaken at
all for the flames. Anger slid across the surface of the Void, and
he channeled.</p>

<p>A wave of fire enveloped the crimson curtain sweeping
toward him and rolled on, carrying it away, not a thin slice, but
wild, billowing gouts as if whipped by stormwinds. He quivered with
the Power roaring through him; anger at Asmodean clawed at the
surface of the Void.</p>

<p>A hole appeared in the erupting surface. No, not a
hole exactly. Asmodean and his shining platform stood in the middle
of it; but as the flaming wave washed forward it slid together
again. The Forsaken had built some sort of shield around
himself.</p>

<p>Rand made himself ignore the distant anger outside
the Void. It was only in cold calm that he could touch
<em>saidin</em>; acknowledging anger would shatter the Void. The
billows of fire ceased to exist as he stopped channeling. He had to
catch the man, not kill him.</p>

<p>The stone step slid through the blackness even
faster. Asmodean drew closer.</p>

<p>Abruptly the Forsaken&rsquo;s platform stopped. A bright
hole appeared in front of him, and he jumped through; the silvery
thing vanished, and the door began to close.</p>

<p>Rand lashed out wildly with the Power. He had to hold
it open; once it closed, he would have no idea where Asmodean had
fled. The shrinking stopped. A square of harsh sunlight, big enough
to step through. He had to hold it open, reach it before Asmodean
could go too far&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even as he thought about stopping, the step halted
dead. It halted, but he hurtled forward, flying through the
doorway. Something tugged his boot, and then he was tumbling head
over heels across hard ground, to land finally in a breathless
heap.</p>

<p>Fighting to fill his lungs, he pushed himself to his
feet, not daring to let himself be helpless a moment. The One
Power still filled him with life and vileness; his bruises felt as
distant as his struggle for breath, as far off as the yellow dust
that covered his damp clothes, covered him. Yet at the same time he
was aware of every stir of furnace air, every grain of dust, every
minute crack in the hard-baked clay. Already the sun was baking
away the moisture, sucking it from his shirt and breeches. He was
in the Waste, in the valley below Chaendaer, not fifty steps from
fog-shrouded Rhuidean. The doorway was gone.</p>

<p>He took a step toward the wall of mist and stopped,
lifting his left foot. His bootheel was sliced cleanly though. The
tug he had felt; the doorway closing. He was dimly aware of
shivering in spite of the heat. He had not known it was that
dangerous. The Forsaken had all the knowledge. Asmodean would not
escape him.</p>

<p>Grimly he adjusted his clothes, tucking the carved
little man and his sword firmly in place, ran to the fog and in.
Gray blindness enveloped him. The Power filling him did nothing to
make him see better here. Running blind.</p>

<p>Abruptly he threw himself down, rolling the last
stride out of the fog onto gritty paving stones. Lying there, he
stared up at three bright ribbons, silver-blue in the strange light
of Rhuidean, stretching to left and right, floating in the air.
When he stood, they were at the level of his waist, chest and neck,
and so thin that they vanished edge-on. He could see how they had
been made and hung, even if he did not understand it. Hard as
steel, sharp enough to make a razor seem a feather. Had he run into
those, they would have sliced through him. A tiny surge of the
Power, and the silver ribbons fell in dust. Cold anger, outside the
Void; inside, cold purpose, and the One Power.</p>

<p>The bluish glow of the fog dome cast its shadowless
light on the half-finished, slab-sided palaces of marble and
crystal and cut glass, the cloud-piercing towers, fluted and
spiraled. And down the broad street ahead of him ran Asmodean, past
dry fountains, toward the great plaza at the heart of the city.</p>

<p>Rand channeled&mdash;it seemed oddly difficult; he
pulled at <em>saidin</em>, wrenched at it until it raged into him&mdash;he channeled, and thick bolts of jagged lightning shot from
the dome-clouds. Not at Asmodean, Just ahead of the Forsaken,
gleaming pillars of red and white, fifty feet thick and a hundred
paces high, centuries old, exploded and toppled across the street
in rubble and clouds of dust.</p>

<p>From huge windows of colored glass, images of
majestically serene men and women seemed to look at Rand in
reproof. &ldquo;I have to stop him,&rdquo; he told them; his voice seemed to
echo in his own ears.</p>

<p>Asmodean paused, starting back from the collapsing
masonry. The dust drifting toward him never touched his shiny red
coat; it parted around him, leaving clear air.</p>

<p>Fire bloomed around Rand, enveloped him as the air
<em>became</em> flame&mdash;and vanished before he was even aware
of how he did it. His clothes were dry and hot; his hair felt
singed, and baked dust fell at every step as he ran. Asmodean was
scrambling over the broken stone blocking the street; more
lightning flashed, raising gouts of shattered paving stone ahead of
him, ripping open crystal palace walls to rain ruin before him.</p>

<p>The Forsaken did not slow, and as he vanished,
lightning flashed from the glowing clouds toward Rand, stabbing
blindly but meant to kill. Running, Rand wove a shield around
himself. Shards of stone bounded from it as he dodged crackling
blue bolts, leaped over the holes they tore in the pavement. The
air itself sparkled; the hair of his arms lifted with it, the hair
on his head stirred.</p>

<p>There was something woven into the barrier of
shattered columns. He hardened the shield around himself. Great
tumbled chunks of red and white stone exploded as he reached to
climb, a burst of pure light and flying stone. Safe inside his
bubble, he ran through, only vaguely aware of the rumble of
collapsing buildings. He had to stop Asmodean. Straining&mdash;and
it took strain&mdash;he threw lightning ahead, balls of fire
ripping up out of the ground, anything to slow the red-coated man.
He was catching up. He entered the plaza only a dozen paces behind.
Trying to increase his speed, he redoubled his efforts at slowing
Asmodean, and fleeing, Asmodean fought to kill him.</p>

<p>The <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> and other precious things
the Aiel had given their lives to bring here were hurled into the
air by lightning, tossed wildly by spinning whirlwinds of fire,
constructs of silver and crystal shattering, strange metal shapes
toppling as the ground shivered and broke open in wide rents.</p>

<p>Searching wildly, Asmodean ran. And flung himself at
what might seem the least significant thing in all that litter. A
carved white stone figurine perhaps a foot long, lying on its back,
a man holding a crystal sphere in one upraised hand. Asmodean
closed his hands on it with an exultant cry.</p>

<p>A heartbeat later, Rand&rsquo;s hands grasped it, too. For
the barest instant he stared into the Forsaken&rsquo;s face; he looked no
different than he had as a gleeman, except for a wild desperation
in his dark eyes, a somewhat handsome man in his middle
years&mdash;nothing at all to say he was one of the Forsaken. The barest
instant, and they both reached through the figure, through the
<em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, for one of the two most powerful
<em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em> ever made.</p>

<p>Vaguely Rand was aware of a great, half-buried statue
in far-off Cairhien, of the huge crystal sphere in its hand,
glowing like the sun, pulsing with the One Power. And the Power in
him surged up like all the seas of the world in storm. With this
surely he could do anything; surely he could even have Healed that
dead child. The taint swelled as much, curling &rsquo;round every
particle of him, seeping into every crevice, into his soul. He
wanted to howl; he wanted to explode. Yet he only held half what
that <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em> could deliver; the other half filled
Asmodean.</p>

<p>Back and forth they straggled, tripping over
scattered and broken <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, falling, neither daring
to let go of the figure with even one finger for fear the other
would pull it away. Yet as they rolled over and over, banging now
against a redstone doorframe that somehow still stood, now against
a fallen crystal statue lying on its side unbroken, a nude woman
clasping a child to her breast, as they fought for possession of
the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, the battle was fought on another level,
too.</p>

<p>Hammers of Power large enough to level mountains
struck at Rand, and blades that could have pierced the earth&rsquo;s
heart; unseen pincers tried to tear his mind from his body, ripped
at his very soul. Every scrap of Power he could draw went to hurl
those attacks away. Any one could destroy him as if he had never
been; he was sure of it. Where they went he could not be sure. The
ground bounded beneath them, shaking them as they struggled,
flinging them about in a writhing tangle of straining muscle. Dimly
he was aware of vast rumbles, of a thousand whining hums like some
strange music. The glass columns, quivering, vibrating. He could
not worry about them.</p>

<p>All those nights without sleep were catching up to
him, the running he had done on top of it. He was tired, and if he
could even know it inside the Void, then he was near exhaustion.
Tossed by the quaking earth, he realized he was no longer trying to
pull the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> from Asmodean, only to hold on. Soon
his strength would go. Even if he managed to retain his grip on the
stone figure, he would have to let go of <em>saidin</em> or be
swept away by the rush of it, destroyed as surely as Asmodean would
do it. He could not pull another thread through the
<em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>; he and Asmodean were equally balanced, each
with half of what the great <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em> in Cairhien could
draw. Asmodean panted in his face, snarling; sweat dripped from the
Forsaken&rsquo;s forehead, ran down his cheeks. The man was tired, too.
But as tired as he?</p>

<p>The flailing earth heaved Rand on top for an instant,
and just as quickly spun Asmodean up, but in that brief moment Rand
felt something pressed between them. The carving of the fat little
man with the sword, still tucked into his waistband. An
insignificant thing next to the immense Power they drew upon. A cup
of water compared to a vast river, to an ocean. He did not even
know if he could use it while linked to the great
<em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>. And if he could? Asmodean&rsquo;s teeth bared. Not a
grimace, but a weary rictus of a smile; the man thought he was
winning. Perhaps he was. Rand&rsquo;s fingers trembled, weakening around
the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>; it was all he could do to hold on to
<em>saidin</em>, even linked as he was to the huge
<em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>.</p>

<p>He had not seen those strange things like black steel
wires around Asmodean since leaving the dark place, but he could
visualize them even in the Void, place them in his mind around the
Forsaken. Tam had taught him the Void as an aid to archery, to be
one with the bow, the arrow, the target. He made himself one with
those imagined black wires. He barely saw Asmodean frown. The man
must be wondering why his face had grown calm; there was always
calm in the moment before the arrow was loosed. He reached through
the small <em>angreal</em> in his waistband, and more of the Power
flowed into him. He did not waste time on exulting; it was such a
small flow beside what he already contained, and this was his final
blow. This would use his final strength. He formed it like a sword
of Power, a sword of Light, and struck; one with the sword, one
with the imagined wires.</p>

<p>Asmodean&rsquo;s eyes went wide, and he screamed, a howl
from the depths of horror; like a struck gong the Forsaken
quivered. For an instant there seemed to be two of him, shivering
away from each other; then they slid back together. He fell over on
his back, arms flung out in his now dirty, tattered red coat, chest
heaving; staring up at nothing, his dark eyes looked lost.</p>

<p>As he collapsed, Rand lost his hold on
<em>saidin</em>, and the Power left him. He had barely enough
strength to clutch the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> to his chest and roll
away from Asmodean. Pushing himself to his knees felt like climbing
a mountain; he huddled around the figure of the man with his
crystal sphere.</p>

<p>The earth had stopped moving. The glass columns still
stood&mdash;he was grateful for that; destroying them would have
been like obliterating the history of the Aiel&mdash;but
<em>Avendesora</em>, that had lived three thousand years in legend
and truth, <em>Avendesora</em> blazed like a torch, and as for the
rest of Rhuidean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The plaza looked as if everything had been picked up
and flung about by a mad giant. Half the great palaces and towers
were only heaps of rubble, some spilling into the square; huge
toppled columns marred others, and fallen walls, and empty gaps
where huge windows of colored glass had been. A rift ran the whole
way across the city, a split in the earth fifty feet wide. The
destruction did not end there. The dome of fog that had hidden
Rhuidean for so many centuries was dissipating; the underside no
longer glowed, and harsh sunlight poured through great new gaps.
Beyond, Chaendaer&rsquo;s peak looked different, lower, and on the other
side of the valley some of the mountains were definitely lower.
Where one mountain had stood, a fan of stone and dirt stretched
across the north end of the valley.</p>

<p><em>I destroy. Always I destroy! Light, will it ever
end?</em></p>

<p>Asmodean rolled onto his belly, pushed to hands and
knees. His eyes found Rand, and the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, and he
made as if to crawl toward them.</p>

<p>Rand could not have channeled a spark, but he had
learned how to fight before his first nightmare of channeling. He
lifted a fist. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even think about it.&rdquo; The Forsaken stopped,
swaying wearily. His face sagged, yet despair and desire warred
across it; hate and fear glittered in his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do like to see men fight, but you two cannot even
stand.&rdquo; Lanfear moved into Rand&rsquo;s view, surveying the devastation.
&ldquo;You have made a thorough job of it. Can you feel the traces? This
place was shielded in some way. You did not leave enough for me to
say how.&rdquo; Dark eyes suddenly bright, she knelt in front of Rand,
peering at what he held. &ldquo;So that is what he was
after. I thought they were all destroyed. Only half remains of the
single one I have seen; a fine trap for some unwary Aes Sedai.&rdquo; She
put out a hand, and he clutched the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> tighter.
Her smile did not touch her eyes. &ldquo;Keep it, certainly. To me it is
no more than a figurine.&rdquo; Rising, she dusted her white skirts
though they did not need it. When she realized he was watching her,
she stopped searching the rubble-strewn plaza with her eyes, made
her smile brighter. &ldquo;What you used was one of the two
<em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em> I told you of. Did you feel the
<em>immensity</em> of it? I have wondered what it must be like.&rdquo;
She seemed unaware of the hunger in her voice. &ldquo;With those,
together, we can displace the Great Lord of the Dark himself. We
can, Lews Therin! Together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help me!&rdquo; Asmodean crawled toward her unsteadily,
his upraised face painted in dread. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what he has
done. You must help me. I would not have come here if not for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has he done?&rdquo; she sniffed. &ldquo;Beaten you like a
dog, and not half so well as you deserve. You were never meant for
greatness, Asmodean, only to follow those who are great.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Somehow Rand managed to stand, still holding the
stone-and-crystal figure to his chest. He would not continue on his
knees in her presence. &ldquo;You <em>Chosen</em>&rdquo;&mdash;he knew
taunting her was dangerous, but he could not stop himself&mdash;&ldquo;gave your souls to the Dark One. You let him attach himself to
you.&rdquo; How many times had he replayed his battle with Ba&rsquo;alzamon?
How many times before he began to suspect what those black wires
were? &ldquo;I cut him off from the Dark One, Lanfear. I cut him
off!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes widened in shock, staring from him to
Asmodean. The man had begun to weep. &ldquo;I did not think that was
possible. Why? Do you think to bring <em>him</em> to the Light?
You&rsquo;ve changed nothing about him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is still the same man who gave himself to the
Shadow in the first place,&rdquo; Rand agreed. &ldquo;You told me how little
you <em>Chosen</em> trust one another. How long could he keep it
secret? How many of you would believe he didn&rsquo;t do it himself
somehow? I am glad you thought it impossible; maybe the rest of you
will as well. You gave me the whole idea, Lanfear. A man to teach
me how to control the Power. But I won&rsquo;t be taught by a man linked
to the Dark One. Now I don&rsquo;t have to be. He may be the same man,
but he doesn&rsquo;t have much choice, does he? He can stay and teach me,
hope I win, help me win, or he can hope the rest of you don&rsquo;t take
the excuse to turn on him. Which do you think he&rsquo;ll choose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Asmodean stared wild-eyed at Rand from his crouch,
then thrust out a pleading hand toward Lanfear. &ldquo;They will believe
you! You can tell them! I would not be here except for you! You
must tell them! I am faithful to the Great Lord of the Dark!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lanfear stared at Rand, too. For the first time ever
that he had seen, she looked uncertain. &ldquo;How much <em>do</em> you
remember, Lews Therin? How much is you, and how much the shepherd?
This is the sort of plan you might have devised when we&mdash;&rdquo;
Drawing a deep breath, she turned her head to Asmodean. &ldquo;Yes, they
will believe me. When I tell them you went over to Lews Therin.
Everyone knows you will leap wherever you think your best chance
lies. There.&rdquo; She nodded to herself in satisfaction. &ldquo;Another
little present for you, Lews Therin. That shield will allow a
trickle through, enough for him to teach. It will dissipate with
time, but he&rsquo;ll not be able to challenge you for months, and by
that time he <em>will</em> have no choice but to remain with you.
He was never very good at breaking through a shield; you must be
willing to accept pain, and he never could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;NOOOOOO!&rdquo; Asmodean crawled toward her. &ldquo;You cannot
do this to me! Please, Mierin! Please!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is <em>Lanfear</em>!&rdquo; Rage twisted her face
to ugliness, and the man lifted into the air, spread-eagled; his
clothes pressed to him and the flesh of his face distorted, spread
out like butter under a rock.</p>

<p>Rand could not let her kill the man, but he was too
tired to touch the True Source unaided; he could barely sense it, a
dim glow just out of sight. For an instant his hands tightened on
the stone man with the crystal sphere. If he reached through to the
huge <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em> in Cairhien again now, that much of the
Power might destroy him. Instead, he reached through the carving in
his waistband; with the <em>angreal</em>, it was a feeble flow, a
hair-thin trickle compared to the other, but he was too weary to
pull more. He hurled it all between the two Forsaken, hoping to
distract her if nothing, else.</p>

<p>A bar of white-hot fire ten feet tall streaked
between the pair in a blur surrounded by arcing blue lightning,
searing a pace-deep groove across the square, a smooth-sided gash
glowing with melted earth and stone; the fiery shaft struck a
green-streaked palace wall and exploded, the roar buried in the
rumble of collapsing marble. On one side of the melted slash
Asmodean dropped to the pavement in a shuddering heap, blood
trickling from nose and ears; on the other, Lanfear staggered back
as if struck, then rounded on Rand. He swayed with the effort of
what he had done, and lost <em>saidin</em> once more.</p>

<p>For a moment rage engorged her face as deeply as it
had for Asmodean. For a moment Rand stood on the brink of death.
Then fury vanished with startling abruptness, buried behind a
seductive smile. &ldquo;No, I mustn&rsquo;t kill him. Not after we have gone to
so much effort.&rdquo; Moving closer, she reached up to stroke the side
of his neck, where her bite from the dream was just healing; he had
not let Moiraine know of it. &ldquo;You still bear my mark. Shall I make
it permanent?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you harm anyone at Alcair Dal, or in the
camps?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her face never stopped smiling, but her caress
changed, fingers suddenly poised as if to rip out his throat. &ldquo;Such
as who? I thought you had realized you did not love that little
farmgirl. Or is it the Aiel jade?&rdquo; A viper. A deadly viper who
loved him&mdash;<em>The Light help me</em>!&mdash;and he did not
know how to stop her if she decided to bite, whether him or someone
else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want anyone hurt. I need them yet. I can use
them.&rdquo; It was painful saying that, painful for the amount of truth
in it. But keeping Lanfear&rsquo;s fangs out of Egwene and Moiraine, away
from Aviendha and anyone else close to him, that was worth a little
pain.</p>

<p>Throwing back her beautiful head, she laughed like
chiming bells. &ldquo;I can remember when you were too softhearted to use
anyone. Devious in battle, hard as stone and arrogant as the
mountains, but open and softhearted as a girl! No, I did not harm
any of your precious Aes Sedai, or your precious Aiel. I do not
kill without cause, Lews Therin. I do not even hurt without cause.&rdquo;
He was careful not to look at Asmodean; white-faced, drawing jagged
breaths, the man had pushed up on one hand, using the other to wipe
blood from his mouth and chin.</p>

<p>Turning slowly, Lanfear surveyed the great square.
&ldquo;You have destroyed this city as well as any army could have.&rdquo; But
it was not the ruined palaces she stared at, though she pretended;
it was the broken square with its jumbled litter of
<em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> and who knew what else. The corners of her
mouth were tight when she turned back to Rand; her dark eyes held a
spark of suppressed anger. &ldquo;Use his teachings well, Lews Therin.
The others are still out there, Sammael with his envy of you,
Demandred with his hate, Rahvin with his thirst for power. They
will be more eager to bring you down, not less, if&mdash;when&mdash;they discover you hold that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her gaze flickered to the foot-tall figure in his
hands, and for an instant he thought she was considering taking it
from him. Not to keep the others from his back, but because with it
he might be too powerful for her to handle. Right then he was not
certain he could stop her if she used nothing but her hands. One
instant she was weighing whether to leave the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>
in his possession, the next measuring his tiredness. However much
she talked of loving him, she would want to be far from him when he
regained enough strength to use the thing. Briefly she scanned the
plaza again, lips pursed; then abruptly a door opened beside her,
not a door to blackness, but into what seemed a palace chamber, all
carved white marble and white silk hangings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which one were you?&rdquo; he said as she stepped toward
it, and she paused, looking over a shoulder at him with an almost
coy smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think I could stand to be fat, ugly Keille?&rdquo;
She ran hands down her rounded slimness for emphasis. &ldquo;Isendre,
now. Slim, beautiful Isendre. I thought if you suspected, you would
suspect her. My pride is strong enough to support a little fat,
when it must.&rdquo; The smile became a baring of teeth. &ldquo;Isendre thought
she was dealing with simple Friends of the Dark. I would not be
surprised if right now she is frantically trying to explain to some
angry Aiel women why a large quantity of their gold necklaces and
bracelets are in the bottom of her chest. She actually did steal
some of them herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you said you didn&rsquo;t harm anyone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now your soft heart shows. I can show a tender,
woman&rsquo;s heart when I choose. You&rsquo;ll not be able to save her being
welted, I think&mdash;she deserves that for the least of the looks
she gave me&mdash;but if you return quickly, you can prevent them
sending her off with one waterskin to walk out of this blighted
land. They are quite hard on thieves, it seems, these Aiel.&rdquo; She
gave an amused laugh, shaking her head in wonder. &ldquo;So different
from what they were. You could slap a Da&rsquo;shain&rsquo;s face, and all he
did was ask what he had done. Slap again, and he asked if he had
offended. He would not change if you continued all day.&rdquo; Giving
Asmodean a contemptuous sidelong look, she added, &ldquo;Learn well and
quickly, Lews Therin. I mean us to rule together, not to watch
Sammael kill you or Graendal add you to her collection of handsome
young men. Learn well and quickly.&rdquo; She stepped into the chamber of
white marble and silk, and the doorway seemed to turn sideways,
narrowed, vanished.</p>

<p>Rand drew the first deep breath he had taken since
her appearance. Mierin. A name remembered from the glass columns.
The woman who had found the Dark One&rsquo;s prison in the Age of
Legends, who had bored into it. Had she known what it was? How had
she escaped that fiery doom he had seen? Had she given herself to
the Dark One even then?</p>

<p>Asmodean was struggling to his feet, unsteady and
nearly falling again. He no longer bled, but blood still traced
thin lines from his ears down the sides of his neck, made a smear
across his mouth and chin. His filthy red coat was torn, his white
lace ripped and snagged. &ldquo;It was my link to the Great Lord that
allowed me to touch <em>saidin</em> without going mad,&rdquo; he said
hoarsely. &ldquo;All you have done is make me as vulnerable as you. You
might as well let me go. I am not a very good teacher. She only
chose me because&mdash;&rdquo; His lips writhed, trying to pull the words
back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because there isn&rsquo;t anyone else,&rdquo; Rand finished for
him and turned away.</p>

<p>On tottering legs Rand crossed the broad square,
picking his way through the litter. He and Asmodean had been flung
halfway around the forest of glass columns from
<em>Avendesora</em>. Crystal plinths lay against fallen statues of
men and women, some broken in chunks, some not even chipped. A
great flat ring of silvery metal had been flipped up on chairs of
metal and stone, strange shapes in metal and crystal and glass, all
mixed in a heap with shattered bits, a black metal shaft like a
spear standing upright, improbably balanced on the pile. The entire
plaza was like that.</p>

<p>Out from the great tree, a little searching among the
jumble found what he sought. Kicking aside pieces of what seemed to
be spiraled glass tubes, he shoved a plain-carved chair of red
crystal aside and picked up a foot-tall figurine, a robed woman
with a serene face, worked in white stone, holding up a clear
sphere in one hand. Unbroken. As useless to him, or to any man, as
its male twin was to Lanfear. He considered breaking it. One swing
of his arm could shatter that crystal globe on the paving stones,
surely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was looking for that.&rdquo; He had not realized
Asmodean had followed him. Wavering, the man scrubbed at his bloody
mouth. &ldquo;She will rip your heart out to put her hands on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or yours, for keeping it secret from her. She
<em>loves</em> me.&rdquo; <em>Light help me. Like being loved by a rabid
wolf!</em> After a moment he put the female statue in the crook of
his arm with the male. There might be a use for it. <em>And I don&rsquo;t
want to destroy anything else</em>.</p>

<p>Yet as he looked around, he saw something besides
destruction. The fog was almost gone from the ruined city; only a
few wispy sheets remained to drift among the buildings still
standing beneath the sinking sun. The valley floor tilted sharply
to the south now, and water spilled out of the great rent across
the city, the gash that went all the way down to where that deep
hidden ocean of water lay. Already the lower end of the valley was
filling. A lake. It might reach nearly to the city eventually, a
lake maybe three miles long in a land where a pool ten feet across
drew people. People would come to this valley to live. He could
almost see the surrounding mountains already terraced with crops
growing green. They would tend <em>Avendesora</em>, the last chora
tree. Perhaps they would even rebuild Rhuidean. The Waste would
have a city. Perhaps he would even live to see it.</p>

<p>With the <em>angreal</em>, the round little man with
his sword, he was able to open a doorway to blackness. Asmodean
stepped through with him reluctantly, sneering faintly when a
single carved stone step appeared, just wide enough for the two of
them. Still the same man who had given himself to the Dark One. His
calculating, sideways glances were reminder enough of that, if Rand
needed any.</p>

<p>They only spoke twice as the step soared through the
darkness.</p>

<p>Once Rand said, &ldquo;I cannot call you Asmodean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man shivered. &ldquo;My name was Joar Addam Nesossin,&rdquo;
he said at last. He sounded as if he had stripped himself bare, or
lost something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t use that either. Who knows what scrap holds
that name somewhere? The idea is to keep someone from killing you
for a Forsaken.&rdquo; And to keep anyone from knowing he had a Forsaken
for teacher. &ldquo;You will have to go on being Jasin Natael, I think.
Gleeman to the Dragon Reborn. Excuse enough for keeping you close.&rdquo;
Natael grimaced, but said nothing.</p>

<p>A little later, Rand said, &ldquo;The first thing you&rsquo;ll
show me is how to guard my dreams.&rdquo; The man only nodded, sullenly.
He would cause problems, but they could not be as large as the
problems of ignorance.</p>

<p>The step slowed, stopped, and Rand <em>folded</em>
again. The doorway opened on the ledge in Alcair Dal.</p>

<p>The rain had stopped, though the evening-shadowed
floor of the canyon was still sodden, churned to mud by Aiel feet.
Fewer Aiel than before, perhaps as many as a fourth fewer. But not
fighting. Staring at the ledge, where Moiraine and Egwene, Aviendha
and the Wise Ones had joined the clan chiefs, who stood talking
with Lan. Mat was squatting a little distance from them, hat brim
pulled down and black-hafted spear propped on his shoulder, Adelin
and her Maidens standing around him. They gaped as Rand stepped out
of the doorway, stared more when Natael followed in his tattered
shiny red coat and white lace. Mat jumped to his feet with a grin,
and Aviendha half-raised a hand toward him. The Aiel in the canyon
watched silently.</p>

<p>Before anyone could speak, Rand said, &ldquo;Adelin, would
you send someone out to the fair and tell them to stop beating
Isendre? She is not as big a thief as they think.&rdquo; The
yellow-haired woman looked startled, but immediately spoke to one
of the Maidens, who dashed off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you know about that?&rdquo; Egwene exclaimed, at
the same time Moiraine demanded, &ldquo;Where have you been? How?&rdquo; Her
wide dark eyes darted from him to Natael, her Aes Sedai calm
nowhere in evidence. And the Wise Ones&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Sun-haired Melaine
looked ready to drag answers out of him with her bare hands. Bair
scowled as though she meant to switch them out. Amys shifted her
shawl and ran fingers through her pale hair, unable to decide
whether she was worried or relieved.</p>

<p>Adelin handed him his coat, still damp. He wrapped it
around the two stone figures. Moiraine was considering those, too.
He did not know if she even suspected what they were, but he
intended to hide them as best he could from anyone. If he could not
trust himself with <em>Callandor</em>&rsquo;s power, how much less with
the great <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>? Not until he had learned more of how
to control it, and himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happened here?&rdquo; he asked, and the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s
mouth tightened at being ignored. Egwene did not look much more
pleased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Shaido have gone, behind Sevanna and Couladin,&rdquo;
Rhuarc said. &ldquo;All who remain acknowledge you as
<em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Shaido were not the only ones who fled.&rdquo; Han&rsquo;s
leathery face twisted sourly. &ldquo;Some of my Tomanelle went as well.
And Goshien, and Shaarad, and Chareen.&rdquo; Jheran and Erim nodded
almost as dourly as Han.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not with the Shaido,&rdquo; tall Bael rumbled, &ldquo;but they
went. They will spread what happened here, what you revealed. That
was ill done. I saw men throw away their spears and run!&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>He will bind you together, and destroy
you</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No Taardad left,&rdquo; Rhuarc put in, not pridefully but
as a simple statement of fact. &ldquo;We are ready to go where you
lead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Where he led. He was not done with the Shaido, with
Couladin, or Sevanna. Scanning the Aiel around the canyon he could
see shaken faces, for all they had chosen to stay. What must those
who had run be like? Yet the Aiel were only a means to an end. He
had to remember that. <em>I have to be even harder than
they</em>.</p>

<p>Jeade&rsquo;en waited beside the ledge with Mat&rsquo;s gelding.
Motioning Natael to stay close, Rand climbed into the saddle,
coat-wrapped bundle secure under his arm. Mouth twisted, the once
Foresaken came to stand by his left stirrup. Adelin and her
remaining Maidens leaped down to form around them, and
surprisingly, Aviendha climbed down to take her usual place on his
right. Mat jumped to Pips&rsquo;s saddle in one bound.</p>

<p>Rand looked back up at the people on the ledge, all
of them watching, waiting. &ldquo;It will be a long road back.&rdquo; Bael
turned his face away. &ldquo;Long, and bloody.&rdquo; The Aiel faces did not
change. Egwene half stretched out a hand toward him, eyes pained,
but he ignored her. &ldquo;When the rest of the clan chiefs come, it
begins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It began long ago,&rdquo; Rhuarc said quietly. &ldquo;The
question is where and how it ends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For that, Rand had no answer. Turning the dapple, he
rode slowly across the canyon, surrounded by his peculiar retinue.
Aiel parted in front of him, staring, waiting. The night&rsquo;s cold was
already coming on.</p>
