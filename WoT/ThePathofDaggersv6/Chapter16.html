<h4><em>Unexpected Absences</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">B</span>efore
the sun made a rim on the horizon the next
morning, Egwene convened the Hall of the Tower. In Tar Valon, that
would have been accompanied by considerable ceremony, and even
since leaving Salidar they had held to some despite the
difficulties of travel. Now, Sheriam simply went from Sitter&rsquo;s
tent to Sitter&rsquo;s tent while it was still dark to announce that
the Amyrlin Seat had called the Hall to Sit. In fact, they did not
sit at all. In the grayness just before true sunrise, eighteen
women stood in a semicircle on the snow to hear Egwene, all bundled
against the cold that misted their breath.</p>

<p>Other sisters began appearing behind them to listen,
only a few at the start, but when no one told them to leave, the
group thickened and spread out to a soft buzz of talk. A very muted
buzz. Few sisters would risk bothering a lone Sitter, much less the
entire Hall. The Accepted in banded dresses and cloaks who had
appeared behind the Aes Sedai were quieter, of course, and even
quieter the gathering novices who had no chores, though there were
a good many more of them. The camp now held half again as many
novices as sisters, so many that few possessed a proper white cloak
and most made do with a simple white skirt instead of a novice
dress. Some sisters still believed they should go back to the old
ways and let girls seek them out, but most regretted the lost
years, when Aes Sedai numbers dwindled. Egwene herself almost
shivered whenever she thought of what the Tower could have been.
This was one change not even Siuan could object to.</p>

<p>In the midst of all the gathering, Carlinya came
around the corner of a tent and stopped short at the sight of
Egwene and the Sitters. Normally composure to her toenails, the
White sister gaped, and her pale face reddened before she hurried
away, looking back over her shoulder. Egwene stifled a grimace.
Everyone was too concerned with what she herself was about this
morning to have noticed, but sooner or later, someone was going to,
and wonder.</p>

<p>Flinging back her delicately embroidered cloak to
reveal the narrow blue stole of the Keeper, Sheriam made Egwene as
much of a formal curtsy as her bulky garments allowed before taking
a place at her side. Wrapped in layers of fine wool and silk, the
flame-haired woman was the very picture of equanimity. At
Egwene&rsquo;s nod, she took one step forward to intone the ancient
formula in a clear, high voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She comes; she comes! The Watcher of the Seals, the
Flame of Tar Valon, the Amyrlin Seat. Attend you all, for she
comes!&rdquo; It seemed a little out of place here, and besides, she was
already there, not coming. The Sitters stood in silence, waiting. A
few frowned impatiently, or fiddled restlessly with cloaks or
skirts.</p>

<p>Egwene pushed back her own cloak, uncovering the
seven-striped stole draped around her neck. These women needed any
reminder she could give that she was indeed the Amyrlin Seat.
&ldquo;Everyone is weary from travel in this weather,&rdquo; she announced, not
quite so loudly as Sheriam, but loud enough that everyone could
hear. She felt a tingle of anticipation, an almost lightheaded
thrill. It was not much different from being queasy. &ldquo;I have
decided to stop here for two days, perhaps three.&rdquo; That brought
heads up and sparked interest. She hoped Siuan was in the listening
crowd. She did try to hold to the Oaths. &ldquo;The horses need rest,
too, and many of the wagons badly need repairs. The Keeper will see
to the necessary arrangements.&rdquo; It truly was begun, now.</p>

<p>She expected neither argument nor discussion, and
there was none. What she had told Siuan was no exaggeration. Too
many sisters hoped for a miracle, so they would not have to march
on Tar Valon with the world watching. Even among those convinced in
their souls that Elaida must be ousted for the good of the Tower,
despite everything they had done, too many would grasp any chance
of delay, any chance for that miracle to appear.</p>

<p>One of those last, Romanda, did not wait for Sheriam
to speak the closing lines. As soon as Egwene finished speaking,
Romanda, looking quite youthful with her tight gray bun hidden by
her hood, simply strode away. Cloaks flapping, Magla, Saroiya, and
Varilin scurried after her. As well as anyone could scurry, when
every other step sank ankle-deep. They did a good job of it anyway;
Sitters or no, they hardly seemed to breathe without Romanda&rsquo;s
permission. When Lelaine saw Romanda leaving, she gathered up
Faiselle, Takima, and Lyrelle from the semicircle with a gesture
and went without a backward glance, like a swan with three anxious
goslings. If they were not so firmly in Lelaine&rsquo;s grasp as the
other three were in Romanda&rsquo;s, they did not fall far short.
For that matter, the rest of the Sitters barely waited on the final
&ldquo;Depart now in the Light&rdquo; to leave Sheriam&rsquo;s lips. Egwene
turned to go with her Hall of the Tower already scattering in every
direction. That tingle was stronger. And <em>very</em> like being
queasy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three days,&rdquo; Sheriam murmured, offering Egwene a
hand to help her down into one of the rutted paths. The corners of
her tilted green eyes crinkled quizzically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised,
Mother. Forgive me, but you dug in your heels nearly every time I
wanted to stop for more than one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak to me again after you&rsquo;ve talked to the
wheelwrights and farriers,&rdquo; Egwene told her. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not go far
with horses dropping dead and wagons falling apart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you say, Mother,&rdquo; the other woman replied, not
precisely meekly, but in perfect acceptance.</p>

<p>The footing was no better now than it had been the
night before, and their steps sometimes slid. Linking arms, they
walked on slowly. Sheriam offered more support than Egwene
required, but she did so almost surreptitiously. The Amyrlin Seat
should not fall on her bottom in the full view of fifty sisters and
a hundred servants, but neither should she seem propped up like an
invalid.</p>

<p>Most of the Sitters who had sworn to Egwene, Sheriam
included, had done so out of simple fear, really, and
self-preservation. If the Hall learned they had sent sisters to
sway the Aes Sedai in Tar Valon, and worse, kept the fact from the
Hall for fear of Darkfriends among the Sitters, they surely and
certainly would spend the rest of their lives in penance and exile.
So the women who had believed they could somehow twitch Egwene
about like a puppet, after the greater part of their influence with
the Hall melted, instead found themselves sworn to obey her. That
was rare even in the secret histories; sisters were expected to
obey the Amyrlin, but swearing fealty was something else again.
Most still seemed unsettled by it, though they did obey. Few were
as bad as Carlinya, but Egwene had actually heard Beonin&rsquo;s
teeth chatter the first time she saw Egwene with Sitters after
swearing. Morvrin looked astonished anew whenever her eyes fell on
Egwene, as if she still did not quite believe, and Nisao hardly
seemed to stop frowning. Anaiya clicked her tongue over the
secrecy, and Myrelle often flinched, though for more reason than
taking an oath. But Sheriam simply had settled into the role of
Egwene&rsquo;s Keeper of the Chronicles in truth, not just name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I suggest using this opportunity to see what the
surrounding country offers in way of food and fodder, Mother? Our
stocks are low.&rdquo; Sheriam frowned anxiously. &ldquo;Especially tea and
salt, though I doubt we&rsquo;ll find those.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do what you can,&rdquo; Egwene said in a soothing tone.
Odd now, to think that once she had gone in awe of Sheriam, and in
no little fear of her displeasure. Strange as it seemed, now that
she was no longer Mistress of Novices, no longer trying to tug and
push Egwene to do as she wished, Sheriam actually seemed happier.
&ldquo;I have every confidence in you, Sheriam.&rdquo; The woman positively
beamed at the compliment.</p>

<p>The sun still did not show above the tents and wagons
to the east, but the camp was already bustling. In a manner of
speaking. Breakfast done, the cooks were cleaning up, helped by a
horde of novices. From the vigor they put into it, the young women
seemed to find some warmth in scrubbing kettles with snow, but the
cooks moved laboriously, knuckling their backs, stopping to sigh
and sometimes to pull their cloaks close and stare bleakly at the
snow. Shivering serving men, wearing most of the clothes they
owned, had begun striking tents and loading wagons automatically as
soon as they finished their hasty meal, and were now stumbling
about to raise the tents and haul chests out of the wagons. Animals
that had been being harnessed were now being led away by weary
horse-handlers who walked with heads down. Egwene heard a few
grumbles from men who failed to notice there were sisters nearby,
but the greater number seemed too tired to voice a complaint.</p>

<p>Most of the Aes Sedai whose tents were up had
vanished inside, but a good many still directed workers, and others
hurried along the sunken paths on errands of their own. Unlike
everyone else, they showed as little outward weariness as the
Warders, who somehow managed to appear as if they had had all the
sleep they needed for this fine spring day. Egwene suspected that
was a real part of how a sister drew strength from her Warder,
quite aside from what she could do with the bond. When your Warder
would not admit to himself that he was cold or tired or hungry, you
just had to bear up as well.</p>

<p>On one of the crossing paths, Morvrin appeared,
clutching Takima&rsquo;s arm. Perhaps it was for support, though
Morvrin was wide enough to make the shorter woman seem more
diminutive than she actually was. Perhaps it was to keep Takima
from escaping; Morvrin was dogged once she set a goal. Egwene
frowned. Morvrin might well be expected to seek out a Sitter for
her Ajah, the Brown, yet Egwene would have thought Janya or
Escaralde more likely. The two passed out of sight behind a
canvas-topped wagon on runners, Morvrin bending to talk in her
companion&rsquo;s ear. There was no way to tell whether Takima was
paying any mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is something the matter, Mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene put on a smile that felt tight. &ldquo;No more than
usual, Sheriam. No more than usual.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the Amyrlin&rsquo;s Study, Sheriam departed to see
to the tasks Egwene had given her, and Egwene went in to find
everything in readiness. She would have been surprised at anything
else. Selame was just setting a tea tray on the writing table.
Brightly colored beadwork ran across the rail-thin woman&rsquo;s
bodice and down her sleeves, and with her long nose carried high,
she hardly seemed a servant at first glance, but she had seen to
what needed doing. Two braziers full of glowing coals had taken
some of the chill off the air, though most of the heat rushed out
through the smoke hole. Dried herbs sprinkled on the coals gave a
pleasant scent to the smoke that did not escape, the tray from the
night before was gone, and the lantern and tallow candles had been
trimmed and lit. No one was about to leave a tent open enough to
let in light from outside.</p>

<p>Siuan was already there, too, with a stack of papers
in her hands, a harried expression on her face, and a smudge of ink
on her nose. The post of secretary provided the two of them another
reason to be seen talking, and Sheriam had not minded at all giving
up the work. Siuan herself grumbled frequently, however. For a
woman who had seldom left the Tower since entering as a novice, she
had a remarkable dislike for staying inside. At the moment she was
the picture of a woman being patient and wanting everyone to know
it.</p>

<p>For all her high nose, Selame simpered and bobbed so
many curtsies that taking Egwene&rsquo;s cloak and mittens turned
into an elaborate little ceremony. The woman nattered on about the
Mother putting her feet up, and perhaps she should fetch the Mother
a lap robe, and maybe she should stay in case the Mother wanted
anything else, until Egwene practically chased her out. The tea
tasted of mint. In this weather! Selame was a trial, and she could
hardly be called loyal, but she did try.</p>

<p>There was no time for lounging and sipping tea,
though. Egwene straightened her stole and took her place behind the
writing desk, absentmindedly giving a yank to the leg of her chair
so it would not fold beneath her as it often did. Siuan perched
atop a rickety stool on the other side of the table, and the tea
cooled. They did not speak of plans, or Gareth Bryne, or hopes;
what could be done there for now, had been. Reports and problems
piled up when they were on the move and weariness overcame attempts
to deal with them, and now that they were stopped, all had to be
gone through. An army ahead did not change that.</p>

<p>At times, Egwene wondered how so much paper could be
found when everything else seemed so difficult. The reports Siuan
handed her detailed shortages and little else. Not simply those
Sheriam had mentioned, but coal and nails and iron for the farriers
and wheelwrights, leather and oiled thread for the harness-makers,
lamp oil and candles and a hundred other things, even soap. And
whatever was not running out was wearing out, from shoes to tents,
all listed in Siuan&rsquo;s bold hand, which grew more aggressive
the more glaring the need she wrote about. Her account of the coin
remaining looked to have been slashed onto the paper in a positive
fury. And not a thing to be done about it.</p>

<p>Among Siuan&rsquo;s papers were several addresses from
Sitters suggesting ways to solve the problem of money. Or rather,
informing Egwene what they intended to lay before the Hall. There
were few advantages to any of the schemes, however, and many
pitfalls. Moria Karentanis proposed stopping the soldiers&rsquo;
pay, a notion Egwene thought the Hall had already realized would
cause the army to melt away like dew under a midsummer sun. Malind
Nachenin presented an appeal to nearby nobles that sounded more a
demand and might well turn the whole countryside against them, as
would Salita Toranes&rsquo; intention to levy a tax on the towns and
villages they passed.</p>

<p>Crumpling the three addresses together in her fist,
Egwene shook them at Siuan. She wished it were three Sitters&rsquo;
throats she was gripping. &ldquo;Do they <em>all</em> think everything
has to go the way they wish, and never mind realities? Light, <em>
they&rsquo;re</em> the ones behaving like children!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Tower has managed to makes its wishes become
realities often enough,&rdquo; Siuan said complacently. &ldquo;Remember, some
would say you&rsquo;re ignoring reality, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene sniffed. Luckily, whatever the Hall voted,
none of the proposals could be carried forward without a decree
from her. Even in her straitened circumstances, she had a little
power. Very little, but that was more than none. &ldquo;Is the Hall
always this bad, Siuan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Siuan nodded, shifting slightly to try to find a
better balance. No two of her stool&rsquo;s legs were the same
length. &ldquo;But it could be worse. Remind me to tell you about the
Year of the Four Amyrlins; that was about a hundred and fifty years
after the founding of Tar Valon. In those days, the normal workings
of the Tower nearly rivaled what&rsquo;s happening today. Every hand
tried to snatch the tiller, if they could. There were actually two
rival Halls of the Tower in Tar Valon for part of that year. Almost
like now. Just about everyone came to grief in the end, including a
few who thought they were going to save the Tower. Some of them
might have, if they hadn&rsquo;t stepped in quicksand. The Tower
survived anyway, of course. It always does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A great deal of history grew up in over three
thousand years, much suppressed, hidden from all but a few eyes,
yet Siuan seemed to have every detail at her fingertips. She must
have spent a good part of her years in the Tower <em>burying</em>
herself in those secret histories. Of one thing, Egwene was
certain. She would avoid Shein&rsquo;s fate if she could, but she
would not remain as she was, little better off than Cemaile
Sorenthaine. Long before the end of her reign, the most important
decision left to Cemaile&rsquo;s discretion was what dress to wear.
She <em>was</em> going to have to ask Siuan to tell her about the
Year of the Four Amyrlins, and she did not look forward to it.</p>

<p>The shifting beam of light from the smoke hole in the
roof showed morning toward midday, but Siuan&rsquo;s stack of papers
seemed hardly diminished. Any interruption at all would have been
welcome, even premature discovery. Well, maybe not that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s next, Siuan?&rdquo; she growled.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">A flicker of movement caught Aran&rsquo;gar&rsquo;s
eye, and she peered through the trees toward the army&rsquo;s camp,
an obscuring ring around the tents of the Aes Sedai. A line of
wagon-sledges was moving slowly east, escorted by men on horseback.
The pale sun glinted from armor and the points of lances. She could
not help sneering. Spears and horses! A primitive rabble that could
move no faster than a man could walk, led by a man who did not know
what was happening a hundred miles away. Aes Sedai? She could
destroy the lot of them, and even dying they would never suspect
who was killing them. Of course, she would not survive them long.
That thought made her shiver. The Great Lord gave very few a second
chance at life, and she was not about to throw away hers.</p>

<p>Waiting until the riders moved out of sight into the
forest, she started back toward the camp, thinking idly of
tonight&rsquo;s dreams. Behind her, smooth snow would hide what she
had buried until the spring thaw, more than long enough. Ahead,
some of the men in the camp finally noticed her and straightened
from their tasks to watch. In spite of herself, she smiled and
smoothed her skirt over her hips. It was difficult now to really
remember what life had been like as a man; had she been such an
easily manipulated fool, then? Getting through that swarm with a
corpse unseen had been difficult, even for her, but she enjoyed the
walk back.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The morning went on in a seemingly endless wading
through paper, until what Egwene had known would happen, did.
Certain daily events were sure. There would be bitter cold, there
would be snow, there would be clouds, and gray skies, and wind. And
there would be visits from Lelaine and Romanda.</p>

<p>Weary of sitting, Egwene was stretching her legs when
Lelaine swept into the tent with Faolain at her heels. Frigid air
rolled in with them before the tentflap fell shut. Looking around
with a faintly disapproving air, Lelaine plucked off blue leather
gloves while allowing Faolain to remove the lynx-lined cloak from
her shoulders. Slender and dignified in deep blue silk, with
penetrating eyes, she might have been in her own tent. At a casual
gesture, Faolain retreated deferentially to a corner with the
garment, merely shrugging her own cloak back. Plainly, she was
ready to go on the instant at another wave of the Sitter&rsquo;s
hand. Her dark features wore a cast of resigned meekness, not very
much like her.</p>

<p>Lelaine&rsquo;s reserve cracked for a moment, in a
surprisingly warm smile for Siuan. They had been friends, once,
years ago, and she had even offered something like the patronage
that Faolain had accepted, a Sitter&rsquo;s protection and
sheltering arm against the sneers and accusations of other sisters.
Touching Siuan&rsquo;s cheek, Lelaine softly murmured something that
sounded sympathetic. Siuan blushed, a startling uncertainty
flashing across her face. It was not pretense, Egwene was sure.
Siuan found it difficult to deal with what really had changed in
her, and more, with how easily she was adapting.</p>

<p>Lelaine eyed the stool in front of the writing table
and, as usual, visibly rejected such an unsteady seat. Only then
did she acknowledge Egwene&rsquo;s presence, with the barest dip of
her head. &ldquo;We need to speak of the Sea Folk, Mother,&rdquo; she said in a
tone a bit firm to be directed at the Amyrlin Seat.</p>

<p>Not until Egwene&rsquo;s heart sank down from her
throat did she realize she had been afraid that Lelaine already
knew what Lord Bryne had told her. Or even the meeting he was
arranging. The next instant, her heart leaped back again. The Sea
Folk? Surely the Hall could not have learned of the insane bargain
Nynaeve and Elayne had made. She could not imagine what had led
them into such a disaster, or how she was to deal with it.</p>

<p>Her stomach roiling, she took her place behind the
table without revealing anything of what she felt. And that fool
chair leg folded, nearly dropping her onto the carpets before she
could jerk it straight again. She hoped her cheeks were not
coloring. &ldquo;The Sea Folk in Caemlyn, or in Cairhien?&rdquo; Yes; that
sounded suitably calm and collected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cairhien.&rdquo; Romanda&rsquo;s high voice rang like
sudden chimes. &ldquo;Definitely Cairhien.&rdquo; Her entry made Lelaine&rsquo;s
seem almost diffident, the force of her personality abruptly
filling the tent. There were no warm smiles in Romanda; handsome as
her face was, it did not seem made for them.</p>

<p>Theodrin followed her in, and Romanda swung her cloak
off with a flourish and tossed it to the slim, apple-cheeked sister
with a peremptory gesture that sent Theodrin hurrying to a corner
opposite Faolain. Faolain was distinctly subdued, but
Theodrin&rsquo;s tilted eyes were very wide, as though she was
permanently startled, and her lips seemed ready to gasp. Like
Faolain, her proper place in the hierarchy of Aes Sedai demanded
better employment, but neither was likely to receive it soon.</p>

<p>Romanda&rsquo;s compelling gaze rested a moment on
Siuan, as if considering whether to send her to a corner as well,
then brushed past Lelaine almost dismissively before settling on
Egwene. &ldquo;It seems that young man has been talking with the Sea
Folk, Mother. The Yellow eyes-and-ears in Cairhien are most excited
about it. Do you have any idea what might interest him in the
Atha&rsquo;an Miere?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite the title, Romanda hardly sounded as if she
were addressing the Amyrlin Seat, but then, she never did. There
was no doubt who &ldquo;that young man&rdquo; was. Every sister in the camp
accepted that Rand was the Dragon Reborn, but anyone who heard them
talk would have believed they were speaking of an unruly young lout
who might come to dinner drunk and throw up on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She can hardly know what&rsquo;s in the boy&rsquo;s
head,&rdquo; Lelaine said before Egwene could open her mouth. Her smile
was not at all warm this time. &ldquo;If an answer is to be found,
Romanda, it will be in Caemlyn. The Atha&rsquo;an Miere there are
not sequestered on a ship, and I seriously doubt that high ranking
Sea Folk came so far from the sea on different errands. I&rsquo;ve
never heard of them doing so for any reason. It may be they have an
interest in him. They must know who he is by now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Romanda smiled back, and frost should have appeared
on the tent walls. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s hardly need to state the obvious,
Lelaine. The first question is how to find out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was about to resolve that when you barged in,
Romanda. The next time the Mother encounters Elayne or Nynaeve in
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, she can pass on instructions.
Merilille can discover what the Atha&rsquo;an Miere want, or maybe
what the boy does, when she reaches Caemlyn. A pity the girls
didn&rsquo;t think to set a regular schedule, but we must work
around that. Merilille can meet with a Sitter in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> when she knows.&rdquo; Lelaine made a small
gesture; plainly, she herself was the intended Sitter. &ldquo;I thought
Salidar might be a suitable place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Romanda snorted with amusement. Even in that, there
was no warmth. &ldquo;Easier to instruct Merilille than to see she obeys,
Lelaine. I expect she knows she faces sharp questions. This Bowl of
the Winds should have been brought to us for study first. None of
the sisters in Ebou Dar had much ability in Cloud Dancing, I
believe, and you can see the result, all this hurly-burly and
suddenness. I have a thought to call a question before the Hall
concerning everyone involved.&rdquo; Abruptly the gray-haired
woman&rsquo;s voice became smooth as butter. &ldquo;As I recall, you
supported the choice of Merilille.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a jerk, Lelaine drew herself up. Her eyes
flashed. &ldquo;I supported who the Gray put forward, Romanda, and no
more,&rdquo; she said indignantly. &ldquo;How could I have imagined she would
decide to use the Bowl there? And to include Sea Folk wilders in
the circle! How could she believe they know as much of working
weather as Aes Sedai?&rdquo; Abruptly her ire slipped. She was defending
herself to her fiercest adversary in the Hall, her only real
adversary. And, no doubt worse in her view, she was agreeing with
her about the Sea Folk. There was no question that she did agree,
but giving the fact voice was another matter.</p>

<p>Romanda let her cold smile deepen as Lelaine&rsquo;s
face paled with fury. She straightened her bronze-colored skirts
with meticulous care as Lelaine searched for a way to turn matters
about. &ldquo;We will see how the Hall stands, Lelaine,&rdquo; she said
finally. &ldquo;Until the question is called, I think it best if
Merilille does not meet with any of the Sitters involved in her
selection. Even a suggestion of collusion would be looked at
askance. I&rsquo;m sure you will agree I should be the one to speak
with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lelaine&rsquo;s face paled differently. She was not
afraid, not visibly, yet Egwene could almost see her counting who
might stand for her, or against. Collusion was almost as serious as
a charge of treason, and required only the lesser consensus.
Likely she could avoid that, but the arguments would be deep and
acrimonious, Romanda&rsquo;s faction might even increase. That would
cause untold problems whether or not Egwene&rsquo;s own plans bore
fruit. And there was nothing she could do to stop it, short of
revealing what really had happened in Ebou Dar. As well ask them to
let her accept the same offer Faolain and Theodrin had.</p>

<p>Egwene drew breath. At least she might be able to
prevent the use of Salidar as a meeting place in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. That was where she met Elayne and
Nynaeve, now. When she did, anyway; she had not in days. With
Sitters popping in and out of the World of Dreams, finding anywhere
you could be sure they would not appear was difficult. &ldquo;The next
time I encounter Elayne or Nynaeve, I will pass on your
instructions regarding Merilille. I can let you know when
she&rsquo;s ready to meet you.&rdquo; Which would be never, once she was
done with those instructions.</p>

<p>The Sitters&rsquo; heads whipped around, and two sets
of eyes stared at her. They had forgotten she was there! Struggling
to keep her face smooth, she realized her foot was tapping
irritably, and stopped it. She had to go along with what they
thought of her a while longer, yet. A little while longer. At least
she no longer felt nauseated. Just angry.</p>

<p>Into that moment of silence, Chesa came bustling with
Egwene&rsquo;s midday meal on a cloth-covered tray. Dark-haired,
plump and pretty in her middle years, Chesa managed to convey a
proper respect without cringing. Her curtsy was as simple as her
dark gray dress, with just a touch of plain lace at the throat.
&ldquo;Forgive me for intruding, Mother, Aes Sedai. I <em>am</em> sorry
this is late, Mother, but Meri seems to have wandered off.&rdquo; She
clicked her tongue in exasperation as she set the tray in front of
Egwene. Wandering seemed very unlike the misnamed Meri. That dour
woman was as disapproving of faults in herself as she was of those
in others.</p>

<p>Romanda frowned, but she said nothing. After all, she
could hardly show too much interest in one of Egwene&rsquo;s maids.
Especially when the woman was her spy. Just as Selame was
Lelaine&rsquo;s. Egwene avoided looking at Theodrin or Faolain, both
still standing dutifully in their corners like Accepted, rather
than Aes Sedai themselves.</p>

<p>Chesa half-opened her mouth, but closed it again,
perhaps intimidated by the Sitters. Egwene was relieved when she
dipped another curtsy and left with a murmured &ldquo;By your leave,
Mother.&rdquo; Chesa&rsquo;s advice was always indirect enough for any
sister when anyone else was present, but right then, the last thing
Egwene wanted was even a circumspect reminder to eat while her food
was hot.</p>

<p>Lelaine took up as if there had been no interruption.
&ldquo;The important thing,&rdquo; she said firmly, &ldquo;is to learn what the
Atha&rsquo;an Miere want. Or what the boy does. Maybe he wants to be
their king, too.&rdquo; Holding out her arms, she allowed Faolain to
restore her cloak, which the dark young woman did with care. &ldquo;You
will remember to let me know if you have any thoughts on it,
Mother?&rdquo; That was just barely a request.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will think hard,&rdquo; Egwene told her. Which was not
to say she would share her thoughts. She wished she had a glimmer
of the answer. That the Atha&rsquo;an Miere believed Rand was their
prophesied Coramoor, she knew, though the Hall did not, but what he
wanted from them, or them from him, she could not begin to imagine.
According to Elayne, the Sea Folk with them had no clue. Or said
not. Egwene almost wished one of the handful of sisters who had
come from the Atha&rsquo;an Miere was in the camp. Almost. One way
or another, those Windfinders <em>were</em> going to cause
trouble.</p>

<p>At a wave of Romanda&rsquo;s hand, Theodrin leaped
forward with the Sitter&rsquo;s cloak as though goosed. By
Romanda&rsquo;s expression, Lelaine&rsquo;s recovery did not best
please her. &ldquo;You will remember to tell Merilille I wish to speak
with her, Mother,&rdquo; she said, and that was not a request at all.</p>

<p>For a brief moment the two Sitters stood staring at
one another, Egwene forgotten again in their mutual animosity. They
departed without a word to her, very nearly jostling for precedence
before Romanda slipped out first, drawing Theodrin in her wake.
Baring her teeth, Lelaine practically pushed Faolain from the tent
ahead of her.</p>

<p>Siuan heaved a hearty sigh, and made no attempt to
hide her relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By your leave, Mother,&rdquo; Egwene muttered mockingly.
&ldquo;If you please, Mother. You may go, daughters.&rdquo; Letting out a long
breath, she settled back in her chair. Which promptly pitched her
onto the carpets in a heap. She picked herself up slowly and jerked
her skirts straight, put her stole to rights. At least it had not
happened in front of those two. &ldquo;Go get something to eat, Siuan.
And bring it back. We&rsquo;ve a long day, yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some falls hurt less than others,&rdquo; Siuan said as if
to herself before ducking outside. It was a good thing she went so
quickly, or Egwene might have given her an earful.</p>

<p>She returned soon, though, and they ate hard rolls
and lentil stew laced with tough carrot and scraps of meat Egwene
did not look at closely. There were only a few interruptions,
intrusions where they fell silent and pretended to study reports.
Chesa came to take away the tray, and later to replace the candles,
a task she grumbled over, which was not like her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;d expect Selame to go missing, too?&rdquo; she
muttered, half to herself. &ldquo;Off canoodling with the soldiers, I
expect. That Halima&rsquo;s a bad influence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A skinny young fellow with a dripping nose renewed
the already dead coals in the braziers&mdash;the Amyrlin got more
warmth than most, but that was not a great deal&mdash;and he
stumbled over his own boots and gaped at Egwene in a manner quite
gratifying after the two Sitters. Sheriam appeared to ask whether
Egwene had any further instructions, of all things, and then seemed
to want to stay. Perhaps the few secrets she knew made her nervous;
her eyes certainly darted uneasily.</p>

<p>That was the lot, and Egwene was not sure whether it
was because no one bothered the Amyrlin without cause, or because
everyone knew the real decisions were made in the Hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about this report of soldiers
moving south out of Kandor,&rdquo; Siuan said as soon as the tentflap
fell behind Sheriam. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s just the one, and Borderlanders
seldom go far from the Blight, but every fool knows that, so
it&rsquo;s hardly the kind of tale anyone would make up.&rdquo; She was
not reading from a page, now.</p>

<p>Siuan had managed to keep very tenuous control of the
Amyrlin&rsquo;s network of eyes-and-ears so far, and reports,
rumors, and gossip flowed to her in steady streams, to be studied
before she and Egwene decided what to pass on to the Hall. Leane
had her own network, to add to the flow. Most of it was passed on&mdash;some things the Hall had to know, and there was no guarantee
that the Ajahs would pass on what their own agents learned&mdash;but it all had to be sieved for what might be dangerous, or serve
to divert attention from the real goal.</p>

<p>Few of those streams carried anything good, of late.
Cairhien had produced any number of rumors of Aes Sedai allied with
Rand, or, worse, serving him, yet at least those could be dismissed
out of hand. The Wise Ones would not say much at all about Rand or
anyone connected to him, but according to them, Merana was awaiting
his return, and certainly sisters in the Sun Palace, where the
Dragon Reborn kept his first throne, were more than seed enough to
grow those tales. Others were not easily ignored, even when it was
hard to know what to make of them. A printer in Illian asserted
that he had proof Rand had killed Mattin Stepaneos with his own
hands and destroyed the body with the One Power, while a laborer on
the docks there claimed she had seen the former King carried, bound
and gagged and rolled in a rug, aboard a ship that had sailed in
the night with the blessings of the captain of the Port Watch. The
first was far more likely, but Egwene hoped none of the Ajahs&rsquo;
agents had picked up the same tale. There were already too many
black marks against Rand&rsquo;s name in the sisters&rsquo;
books.</p>

<p>It went on like that. The Seanchan seemed to be
taking a firm hold in Ebou Dar, against very little resistance.
That might have been expected in a land where the Queen&rsquo;s true
rule ended a few days&rsquo; ride from her capital, yet it was
hardly heartening. The Shaido seemed to be everywhere, though word
of them always came from someone who had heard from someone who had
heard. Most sisters seemed to believe the scattered Shaido were
Rand&rsquo;s work despite the Wise Ones&rsquo; denials, carried by
Sheriam. No one wanted to probe the Wise Ones&rsquo; supposed lies
too closely, of course. There were a hundred excuses, but no one
was willing to meet them in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>
except the sisters sworn to Egwene, and they had to be ordered.
Anaiya dryly called the encounters &ldquo;quite compact lessons in
humility,&rdquo; and she did not seem at all amused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There can&rsquo;t <em>be</em> that many Shaido,&rdquo;
Egwene muttered. No herbs had been added to the second batch of
charcoal, which was dying down in faint embers, and her eyes ached
from the smoke that hung thin in the air. Channeling to get rid of
it would disperse the last warmth, too. &ldquo;Some of this must be
bandits&rsquo; work.&rdquo; After all, who could tell a village emptied by
people fleeing brigands from one emptied by Shaido? Especially at
third hand, or fifth. &ldquo;There are certainly enough bandits around to
account for some of it.&rdquo; Most calling themselves Dragonsworn, which
was no help at all. She worked her shoulders to loosen a few of the
knots in her muscles.</p>

<p>Abruptly she realized that Siuan was staring at
nothing so intently that she appeared ready to slip off of her
stool. &ldquo;Siuan, are you falling asleep? We may have worked most of
the day, but it&rsquo;s still light out.&rdquo; There was light at the
smoke hole, though it did appear to be fading.</p>

<p>Siuan blinked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;ve been
thinking about something lately, and trying to decide whether to
share it with you. About the Hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Hall! Siuan, if you know something about the
Hall&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t <em>know</em> anything,&rdquo; Siuan cut in.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what I suspect.&rdquo; She clicked her tongue in annoyance.
&ldquo;Not even suspect, really. At least, I don&rsquo;t know what to
suspect. But I see a pattern.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you had best tell me about it,&rdquo; Egwene said.
Siuan had shown herself very skilled at detecting patterns where
others saw only a jumble.</p>

<p>Shifting on her stool, Siuan leaned forward intently.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this. Aside from Romanda and Moria, the Sitters chosen
in Salidar are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;they&rsquo;re too young.&rdquo; Much had changed in
Siuan, but speaking of other sisters&rsquo; ages clearly made her
uncomfortable. &ldquo;Escaralde is the oldest, and I&rsquo;m sure she
isn&rsquo;t much past seventy. I can&rsquo;t be certain without going
into the novice books in Tar Valon, or her telling us, but I&rsquo;m
as sure as I can be. It isn&rsquo;t often the Hall has held more
than one Sitter under a hundred, and here we have nine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Romanda and Moria <em>are</em> new,&rdquo; Egwene said
gently, resting her elbows on the table. It had been a long day.
&ldquo;And neither is young. Maybe we should be grateful the others are,
or they might not have been willing to raise me.&rdquo; She could have
pointed out that Siuan herself had been chosen Amyrlin at less than
half Escaralde&rsquo;s age, but the reminder would have been
cruel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Siuan said stubbornly. &ldquo;Romanda was certain
for the Hall as soon as she showed up. I doubt there&rsquo;s a
Yellow would dare speak against her for a chair. And Moria&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She doesn&rsquo;t cling to Lelaine, but Lelaine and Lyrelle probably
thought she would. I don&rsquo;t know. Mark me, though. When a woman
is raised too young, there&rsquo;s a reason.&rdquo; She took a deep
breath. &ldquo;Including when I was.&rdquo; The pain of loss flashed across her
face, the loss of the Amyrlin Seat certainly, maybe of all the
losses she had suffered. It was gone almost as soon as it came.
Egwene did not think she had ever known a woman as strong as Siuan
Sanche. &ldquo;This time, there were more than enough sisters of proper
age to choose from, and I can&rsquo;t see five Ajahs deadlocking on
all of them. There is a pattern, and I mean to pick it out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene did not agree. Change hung in the air whether
Siuan wanted to see it or not. Elaida had broken custom, come very
close to breaking law, in usurping Siuan&rsquo;s place. Sisters had
fled the Tower and let the world know of it, and that last
certainly had never happened before. Change. Older sisters were
more likely to be tied to the old ways, but even some of them had
to see that everything was shifting. Surely that was why younger
women, more open to the new, had been chosen. Should she order
Siuan to stop wasting her time with this? Siuan had enough else to
do. Or would it be a kindness to let her continue? She wanted so
deeply to prove that the change she saw was not really occurring at
all.</p>

<p>Before Egwene could make a decision, Romanda ducked
into the tent and stood holding the tentflap open. Long shadows
stretched across the snow outside. Evening was coming fast.
Romanda&rsquo;s face was as dark as those shadows. She fixed Siuan
with a stern gaze and snapped one word. &ldquo;Out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene gave an infinitesimal nod, but Siuan was
already on her feet. She missed a step, then all but ran from the
tent. A sister who stood where Siuan did was expected to obey any
sister of Romanda&rsquo;s strength in the Power, not just a
Sitter.</p>

<p>Throwing down the tentflap, Romanda embraced the
Source. The glow of <em>saidar</em> surrounded her, and she wove a
ward against eavesdropping around the inside of the tent without so
much as a pretense of asking Egwene&rsquo;s permission. &ldquo;You are a
fool!&rdquo; she grated. &ldquo;How long did you think you could keep this a
secret? Soldiers talk, child. Men always talk! Bryne will be lucky
if the Hall doesn&rsquo;t put his head on a pike.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene stood slowly, smoothing her skirt. She had
been waiting for this, but she still needed to be careful. The game
was far from played out, and everything could still turn against
her in a flash. She had to pretend innocence, until she could
afford to stop pretending. &ldquo;Must I remind you that rudeness to the
Amyrlin Seat is a crime, daughter,&rdquo; she said instead. She had been
pretending so long, and she was so close.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Amyrlin Seat.&rdquo; Romanda strode across the carpets
to within arm&rsquo;s reach of Egwene, and by her glare, the thought
of reaching more crossed her mind. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an infant! Your
bottom still remembers the last switching it had as a novice! After
this, you&rsquo;ll be lucky if the Hall doesn&rsquo;t put you in a
corner with a few play pretties. If you want to avoid that, you
will listen to me, and do as I tell you. Now, sit down!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene seethed inside, but she sat. It was too
soon.</p>

<p>With a sharp, satisfied nod, Romanda planted her
fists on her hips. She stared down at Egwene like a stern aunt
lecturing a misbehaving niece. A very stern aunt. Or a headsman
with a toothache. &ldquo;This meeting with Pelivar and Arathelle has to
go forward, now it&rsquo;s been arranged. They expect the Amyrlin
Seat, and they will see her. You will attend with all the pomp and
dignity your title deserves. And you will tell them I am to speak
for you, after which you will hold your tongue! Getting them out
of our way will require a firm hand, and someone who knows what
she&rsquo;s about. No doubt Lelaine will be here any minute, trying
to put herself forward, but you just remember the trouble
she&rsquo;s in. I&rsquo;ve spent the day speaking with other Sitters,
and it appears very likely that Merilille and Merana&rsquo;s
failures will be quite firmly attached to Lelaine when the Hall
sits next. So, if you have any hope of gaining the experience
you&rsquo;ll need to grow into that stole, it lies with me! Do you
understand me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand perfectly,&rdquo; Egwene said, in what she
hoped was a meek voice. If she let Romanda speak in her place,
there would no longer be any doubts. The Hall and the whole world
would know who held Egwene al&rsquo;Vere by the scruff of her
neck.</p>

<p>Romanda&rsquo;s eyes seemed to bore into her head
before the woman gave a curt nod. &ldquo;I hope that you do. I intend to
remove Elaida from the Amyrlin Seat, and I won&rsquo;t see that
ruined because a child thinks she knows enough to find her way
across the street without her hand held.&rdquo; With a snort, she flung
her cloak around her and flung herself out of the tent. The ward
vanished as she did.</p>

<p>Egwene sat and frowned at the tent&rsquo;s entrance. A
child? Burn the woman, she was the Amyrlin Seat! Whether they liked
it or not, they had raised her, and they were going to have to live
with it! Eventually. Snatching up the stone inkwell, she hurled it
at the tentflap.</p>

<p>Lelaine dodged back, barely avoiding the splash.
&ldquo;Temper, temper,&rdquo; she chided, coming on in.</p>

<p>No more asking permission than Romanda had, she
embraced the Source and wove a ward to stop anyone overhearing what
she had to say. Where Romanda had been in a fury, Lelaine appeared
pleased with herself, rubbing her gloved hands and smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose I need tell you your little
secret is out. Very bad of Lord Bryne, but I think he&rsquo;s too
valuable to kill. A good thing for him I do. Let me see. I suppose
Romanda told you that there will be a meeting with Pelivar and
Arathelle, but you are to let her do all the talking. Am I right?&rdquo;
Egwene stirred, but Lelaine waved a hand at her. &ldquo;No need to
answer. I know Romanda. Unfortunately for her, I learned about this
before she did, and instead of running to you straight away,
I&rsquo;ve been polling the other Sitters. Do you want to know what
they think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene balled her fists in her lap, where she hoped
they would not be noticed. &ldquo;I expect you&rsquo;re going to tell
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are in no position to take that tone with me,&rdquo;
Lelaine said sharply, but the next instant, her smile returned.
&ldquo;The Hall is displeased with you. Very displeased. Whatever Romanda
has threatened you with&mdash;and it&rsquo;s easy enough to imagine&mdash;I can deliver. Romanda, on the other hand, has upset a
number of Sitters with her bullying. So, unless you want to find
yourself with less authority than the little you have now, Romanda
is going to be surprised tomorrow when you name me to speak for
you. It&rsquo;s hard to believe Arathelle and Pelivar were foolish
enough to put a thing like this in motion, but they&rsquo;ll slink
away with their tails between their legs once I&rsquo;m done with
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do I know you won&rsquo;t carry out those threats
anyway?&rdquo; Egwene hoped her angry mutter sounded like sullenness.
Light, but she was tired of this!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I say I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Lelaine snapped.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know by now that you aren&rsquo;t really in charge
of anything? The Hall is, and that is between Romanda and me. In
another hundred years, you may grow into the stole, but for now,
sit quietly, fold your hands, and let someone who knows what she is
about see to pulling Elaida down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After Lelaine left, Egwene once more sat staring.
This time, she was not letting anger boil. <em>You may grow into
the stole</em>. Almost the same thing Romanda had said. <em>Someone
who knows what she is about</em>. <em>Was</em> she deceiving
herself? A child, ruining what a woman with experience could handle
easily?</p>

<p>Siuan slipped into the tent and stood looking
worried. &ldquo;Gareth Bryne just came to tell me the Hall knows,&rdquo; she
said dryly. &ldquo;Under cover of asking about his shirts. Him and his
bloody shirts! The meeting is set for tomorrow, at a lake about
five hours to the north. Pelivar and Arathelle are already on the
way. Aemlyn, too. That&rsquo;s a third strong House.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more than Lelaine or Romanda saw fit to
tell me,&rdquo; Egwene said, just as dryly. No. A hundred years of being
led by the hand, pushed by the scruff of her neck, or fifty years,
or five, and she would be fit for nothing more. If she had to grow,
she had to grow <em>now</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, blood and bloody ashes,&rdquo; Siuan groaned. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t stand it! What did they say? How did it go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About as we expected.&rdquo; Egwene smiled with a wonder
that touched her voice, too. &ldquo;Siuan, they couldn&rsquo;t have handed
me the Hall better if I had told them what to do.&rdquo;</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The last light was failing as Sheriam approached her
tiny tent, smaller even than Egwene&rsquo;s. If she had not been
Keeper, she would have had to share. Ducking inside, she had only
time to realize she was not alone when she was shielded and flung
facedown on her cot. Stunned, she tried to cry out, but a corner of
one of her blankets wadded itself into her mouth. Dress and shift
burst away from her body like a pricked bubble.</p>

<p>A hand stroked her head. &ldquo;You were supposed to keep
me informed, Sheriam. That girl is up to something, and I want to
know what.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It took a long time to convince her questioner that
she had already told all she knew, that she would never hold back a
word, not a whisper. When she was left alone at last, it was to lie
curled up and whimpering from her welts, bitterly wishing that she
had never in her life spoken to a single sister in the Hall.</p>
