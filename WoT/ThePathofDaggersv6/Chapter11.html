<h4><em>Questions and an Oath</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
air in the huge stable smelled of old hay and
horse dung. And blood, and burned flesh. With all the doors closed,
the air felt thick. Two lanterns gave little light, and shadows
filled most of the interior. In the long rows of stalls, horses
whickered nervously. The man hanging by his wrists from a roof beam
gave a low moan, then a ragged cough. His head fell down on his
chest. He was a tall man, well-muscled, if rather the worse for
wear.</p>

<p>Abruptly Sevanna realized that his chest no longer
moved. The gem-studded rings on her fingers glittered red and green
as she gestured curtly to Rhiale.</p>

<p>The flame-haired woman pushed the man&rsquo;s head up
and thumbed back one eyelid, then pressed an ear to his chest,
careless of the still-smoldering splinters that peppered him. With
a sound of disgust, she straightened. &ldquo;He is dead. We should have
left this to the Maidens, Sevanna, or the Black Eyes. I do not
doubt we killed him by ignorance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sevanna&rsquo;s mouth tightened, and she shifted her
shawl in a clatter of bracelets. They ran nearly to her elbows, a
noticeable weight in gold and ivory and gems, yet she would have
worn every one she owned if she could. None of the other women said
anything. Putting prisoners to the question was <em>not</em> the
work of Wise Ones, but Rhiale knew why they had to do this
themselves. The lone survivor of ten mounted men who thought they
could defeat twenty Maidens because they rode horses, the man had
also been the first Seanchan captured in the ten days since their
arrival in this land.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He would have lived if he had not fought the pain so
hard, Rhiale,&rdquo; Someryn said finally, shaking her head. &ldquo;A strong
man for a wetlander, but he could not accept pain. Still, he told
us much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sevanna eyed her sideways, trying to see whether she
hid sarcasm. As tall as most men, Someryn wore more bracelets and
necklaces than any woman there except Sevanna herself, layers of
firedrops and emeralds, rubies and sapphires, almost concealing a
too-full bosom that otherwise would have been half bared with her
blouse undone almost to her skirt. Her shawl, tied around her
waist, hid nothing. At times it was difficult for Sevanna to tell
whether Someryn was copying her or competing with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much!&rdquo; Meira exclaimed. In the light of the lantern
she held, her long face was grimmer than usual, though that hardly
seemed possible. Meira could find the dark side of the noonday sun.
&ldquo;That his people lie two days west in the city called Amador? We
knew that. All he has told us are wild tales. Artur Hawkwing! Bah!
The Maidens should have kept him and done what was needed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;risk letting everyone learn too much
too soon?&rdquo; Sevanna bit her lip in vexation. She had almost called
them &ldquo;you fools.&rdquo; Too many already knew too much, in her opinion,
Wise Ones among them, but she could not risk offending these women.
That knowledge grated on her! &ldquo;The people are frightened.&rdquo; There
was no need to hide her contempt for that, at least. What shocked
her, outraged her, was not that they were afraid, but how few made
any effort to hide the fact. &ldquo;Black Eyes, or Stone Dogs, or even
Maidens, would have talked of what he said. You know they would!
His lies would only have spread more fear.&rdquo; They had to be lies. In
Sevanna&rsquo;s mind a sea was like the lakes she had seen in the
wetlands, but with its far side beyond sight. If hundreds of
thousands more of his people were coming, even from the other side
of so large a body of water, the other prisoners she had questioned
would have known of them. And no prisoner was questioned without
her present.</p>

<p>Tion raised the second lantern and regarded her with
unblinking gray eyes. Nearly a head shorter than Someryn, Tion was
still taller than Sevanna. And twice as wide. Her round face often
appeared placid, but thinking her so was a mistake. &ldquo;They are right
to fear,&rdquo; she said in a stony voice. &ldquo;<em>I</em> am afraid, and
take no shame in it. The Seanchan are many if they are no more than
took Amador, and we are few. You have your sept around you,
Sevanna, but where is <em>my</em> sept? Your wetlander friend
Caddar and his tame Aes Sedai sent us through his holes in the air
to die. Where are the rest of the Shaido?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rhiale moved to stand defiantly beside Tion, and they
were quickly joined by Alarys, even now toying with her black hair
to draw attention to it. Or perhaps it was to avoid meeting
Sevanna&rsquo;s eyes. After a moment, a scowling Meira added herself
to the cluster, and then Modarra. Modarra might have been called
slim if she were not even taller than Someryn; as it was, lean was
the best that could be said of her. Sevanna had thought Modarra as
firmly in her grasp as any of the rings on her fingers. As firmly
in her grasp as&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Someryn looked at her and sighed, looked at
the others. Slowly she walked over to stand beside them.</p>

<p>Sevanna was left standing on the very edge of the
lantern&rsquo;s light. Of all the women tied to her by the killing
of Desaine, she trusted these most. Not that she trusted anyone
very far, of course. But Someryn and Modarra she had been sure were
hers as tightly as if they had sworn water oath to follow where she
led. And now they dared face her with accusing eyes. Even Alarys
looked up from playing with her hair.</p>

<p>Sevanna met their stares with a cool smile just short
of a sneer. Now, she decided, was not the time to remind them of
the crime that bound their fates together. Not the bludgeon, this
time. &ldquo;I suspected Caddar might try to betray us,&rdquo; she said
instead. Rhiale&rsquo;s blue eyes widened at the admission, and Tion
opened her mouth. Sevanna went on, not leaving them room to speak.
&ldquo;Would you rather have remained in Kinslayer&rsquo;s Dagger to be
destroyed? To be hunted like animals by four clans whose Wise Ones
know how to make those holes without the traveling boxes? Instead,
we are in the heart of a rich, soft land. Richer even than the
lands of the treekillers. Look at what we have taken in only ten
days. How much more will we take in a wetlander city? You fear the
Seanchan because they have numbers? Remember that I brought every
Shaido Wise One who can channel with me.&rdquo; That she could not
channel herself seldom occurred to her, now. Soon that lack would
be remedied. &ldquo;We are as strong as any force these wetlanders can
send against us. Even if they do have flying lizards.&rdquo; She sniffed
forcefully to show what she thought of those! None of them had seen
one, nor any of the scouts, but nearly every prisoner had been full
of the ridiculous tales. &ldquo;After we find the other septs, we will
take this land for our own. <em>All</em> of it! We will extract a
tenfold repayment from the Aes Sedai. And we will find Caddar and
make him die screaming for mercy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That should have rallied them, restored their hearts
as she had had to do before. Not one woman&rsquo;s face changed. Not
one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And there is the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>,&rdquo; Tion
said calmly. &ldquo;Unless you have given up your plan to marry him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have given up nothing,&rdquo; Sevanna replied irritably.
The man&mdash;and more important, the power that came with him&mdash;would be hers someday. Somehow. Whatever it took. Smoothing
her voice, she went on. &ldquo;Rand al&rsquo;Thor is hardly of consequence
now.&rdquo; At least to these blind simpletons. With him in her hands,
anything would be possible for her. &ldquo;I do not intend to stand here
all day discussing my bridal wreath. I have matters to see to that
<em>are</em> important.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she stalked away from them through the gloom,
toward the doors of the stable, an unpleasant thought suddenly
occurred to her. She was alone with these women. How far <em>
could</em> she trust them, now? Desaine&rsquo;s death remained all
too vivid in her mind; the Wise One had been&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;butchered&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;using the One Power. By the women behind her, among others. The
thought twisted her belly tight. She listened for the faint rustle
of straw that would announce feet following her and heard nothing.
Were they just standing there watching? She refused to look over
her shoulder. Keeping the same slow pace required only a little
effort&mdash;<em>she</em> would not display fear and shame
herself!&mdash;yet when she pushed one of the tall doors open on
its well-oiled hinges and stepped into bright midday light, she
could not stop from drawing a relieved breath.</p>

<p>Efalin was pacing outside, <em>shoufa</em> draped
around her neck, bow cased on her back, spears and buckler in hand.
The gray-haired woman turned abruptly, the worry on her face fading
only a little at sight of Sevanna. The leader of all the Shaido
Maidens, and she let her distress show! She was not Jumai, but she
had come with Sevanna using the excuse that Sevanna spoke as the
chief until a new chief of the Shaido could be chosen. Sevanna was
sure that Efalin suspected that would never happen. Efalin knew
where the power lay. And when to keep her mouth closed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bury him deeply and hide the grave,&rdquo; Sevanna told
her.</p>

<p>Efalin nodded, signaling the Maidens ringing the
stable to their feet, and they vanished inside behind her. Sevanna
studied the building, with its sharp-peaked red roof and blue
walls, then turned to the field in front of it. A low stone fence
with a single opening, right before the stable, enclosed a circle
of hard-packed dirt perhaps a hundred paces across. The wetlanders
had used it for training horses. Why it had been placed so far from
everything else, surrounded by trees so tall that Sevanna still
sometimes stared at them, she had not thought to ask the former
owners, but the isolation served her purposes. The Maidens with
Efalin were those who had captured the Seanchan. No one not here
knew he existed. Or would know. Were the other Wise Ones talking in
there? About her? In front of the Maidens? What were they saying?
She would not wait on them or anyone!</p>

<p>They came out of the stable just as she started off
toward the forest, Someryn and the others, and followed her into
the trees arguing among themselves about the Seanchan, and Caddar,
and where the rest of the Shaido had been sent. Not about her, but
then, they would not where she could listen. What she did hear made
her grimace. There were over three hundred Wise Ones with the
Jumai, and it was the same whenever three or four started talking.
Where were the rest of the septs, and had Caddar been a spear
hurled by Rand al&rsquo;Thor, and how many Seanchan were there, and
even did they really ride lizards? Lizards! These women had been
with her from the first. She had guided their feet step by step,
but they believed they had helped plan every move, believed they
knew the destination. If she was losing them now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The forest gave way to a huge clearing that could
have swallowed the circle back at the stable fifty times over, and
Sevanna felt ill temper slipping away as she stopped to look. Low
hills rose to the north, and mountains a few leagues beyond them
were capped with clouds, great masses of white streaked with dark
gray. She had never seen so many clouds in her life. Closer at
hand, thousands of Jumai went about the day&rsquo;s work. The ring
of hammer on anvil rose from blacksmiths, and sheep and goats were
being slaughtered for the evening meal, their bleating mixed with
the laughter of the children as they ran at play. Given more time
to prepare for their flight from Kinslayer&rsquo;s Dagger than the
other septs, the Jumai had brought the flocks gathered in Cairhien,
and added to them here.</p>

<p>Many people had set up their tents, but there was no
need. Colorful structures nearly filled the clearing like a large
wetlander village, tall barns and stables, a large forge and the
squat roofs that had sheltered servants, all painted red and blue,
surrounding the great roof itself. The manor house that was called,
three floors high beneath a dark green tile roof, all of it a paler
green trimmed with yellow, atop a broad man-made stone hill ten
paces tall. Jumai and <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> climbed the long ramp
that led to the great building&rsquo;s door and walked the ornately
carved balconies that ringed it.</p>

<p>The stone walls and palaces she had seen in Cairhien
had not impressed her half so much. This one was painted like a
wagon of the Lost Ones, but even so, marvelous. She should have
realized that with so many trees, these people could afford to
build <em>anything</em> of wood. Could no one but she see how fat
this land was? More white-clad <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> scurried
about their tasks than any twenty septs had ever had before, nearly
half as many as there were Jumai! No one complained about making
wetlanders <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> anymore. They were so docile! A
wide-eyed young man in rough-sewn white hurried past clutching a
basket, gaping at the people around him and stumbling over the hem
of his robe. Sevanna smiled. That one&rsquo;s father had called
himself the lord of this place and blustered that she and her
people would be hunted down&mdash;by children, of all things!&mdash;for this outrage, yet now he wore white and worked as hard
as his son, as did his wife and his daughters and his other sons.
The women had possessed many fine gems and beautiful silks, and
Sevanna had only taken the first pick for herself. A fat land, so
soft it oozed rich oils.</p>

<p>The women behind her had stopped short to talk among
themselves at the edge of the trees. She caught what they were
saying, and it turned her mood again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;how many Aes Sedai fight for these Seanchan,&rdquo;
Tion was saying. &ldquo;We must learn that.&rdquo; Someryn and Modarra murmured
agreement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think it matters,&rdquo; Rhiale put in. At least
her contrariness extended to the others, too. &ldquo;I do not think they
will fight unless we attack them. Remember, they did nothing until
we moved against them, not even to defend themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when they did,&rdquo; Meira said sourly, &ldquo;twenty-three
of us died. And more than ten thousand <em>
algai&rsquo;d&rsquo;siswai</em> did not return either. Here, we have
little more than a third of that number even counting the
Brotherless.&rdquo; She soaked the last word in scorn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was Rand al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s work!&rdquo; Sevanna
told them sharply. &ldquo;Instead of thinking what he did against us,
think what we can do when he is ours!&rdquo; <em>When he is mine</em>,
she thought. The Aes Sedai had been able to take and hold him as
long as they had, and she had something the Aes Sedai had not, else
they would have used it. &ldquo;Remember instead that we had the Aes
Sedai beaten until he took their side. Aes Sedai are nothing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once again her effort to strengthen their hearts
produced no visible effect. All they could remember was that the
spears had been broken trying to capture Rand al&rsquo;Thor, and
they with them. Modarra might have been staring into the grave of
all her sept, and even Tion frowned uneasily, doubtless recalling
that she, too, had run like a frightened goat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wise Ones,&rdquo; a man&rsquo;s voice said behind Sevanna,
&ldquo;I have been sent to ask for your judgment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instantly every woman&rsquo;s face regained its
equanimity. What she could not do, he had done with his very
presence. No Wise One would allow any but another Wise One to see
her out of countenance. Alarys stopped stroking her hair, which she
had pulled over her shoulder. Plainly none of them recognized him.
Sevanna thought she did.</p>

<p>He regarded them gravely, with green eyes much older
than his smooth face. He had full lips, but there was a set to his
mouth, as if he had forgotten how to smile. &ldquo;I am Kinhuin, of the
<em>Mera&rsquo;din</em>, Wise Ones. The Jumai say we may not take
our full share from this place because we are not Jumai, but it is
because they will have less since we are two for every Jumai <em>
algai&rsquo;d&rsquo;siswai</em>. The Brotherless ask your judgment,
Wise Ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now that they knew who he was, some could not hide
their dislike of the men who had abandoned clan and sept to come to
the Shaido rather than follow Rand al&rsquo;Thor, a wetlander and no
true <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>, as they thought. Tion&rsquo;s
face merely went flat, but Rhiale&rsquo;s eyes flashed, and Meira
teetered on the edge of a scowl. Only Modarra showed concern, but
then, she would have tried to settle a dispute between
treekillers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These six Wise Ones will give judgment after hearing
both sides,&rdquo; Sevanna told Kinhuin with a graveness to match
his.</p>

<p>The other women looked at her, barely concealing
their surprise that she intended to stand aside. It had been she
who arranged for ten times the number of <em>Mera&rsquo;din</em> to
accompany the Jumai as went with any other sept. She really had
suspected Caddar, if not of what he had done, and she had wanted as
many spears around her as possible. Besides, they could always die
in place of Jumai.</p>

<p>She affected surprise at the others&rsquo; surprise.
&ldquo;It would not be fair for me to take part since my own sept is
involved,&rdquo; she told them before turning back to the green-eyed man.
&ldquo;They will give fair judgment, Kinhuin. And I am certain they will
speak in favor of the <em>Mera&rsquo;din</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other women gave her hard looks before Tion
motioned abruptly for Kinhuin to lead the way. He had to tear his
eyes away from Sevanna to comply. Wearing a faint smile&mdash;he
had been staring at her, not Someryn&mdash;she watched them vanish
into the mass of people moving about the manor grounds. For all
their misliking the Brotherless&mdash;and her making predictions
to the man about their decision&mdash;the chances were they <em>
would</em> decide that way. Either way, Kinhuin would remember and
tell the others of his so-called society. The Jumai were already in
her belt pouch, but anything that tied the <em>Mera&rsquo;din</em>
to her was welcome.</p>

<p>Turning, Sevanna strode back into the trees, though
not toward the stable. Now that she was alone, she could see to
something much more important than the Brotherless. She checked
what she had tucked into her skirt at the small of her back, where
her shawl hid it. She would have felt if it slipped a hair, but she
wanted to touch its smooth length with her fingers. No Wise One
would dare think her less than they, once she used that, perhaps
today. And one day, it would give her Rand al&rsquo;Thor. After all,
if Caddar had lied in one thing, maybe he had lied in others.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Through a blur of tears Galina Casban glared at the
Wise One shielding her. As if there were any need for the slender
woman&rsquo;s shield. Right then she could not have so much as
embraced the Source. Sitting cross-legged on the ground between two
squatting Maidens, Belinde adjusted her shawl and gave a thin
smile, as if she knew Galina&rsquo;s thoughts. Her face was narrow
and foxlike, and her hair and eyebrows had been bleached nearly
white by the sun. Galina wished she had crushed her skull instead
of merely slapping her.</p>

<p>It had not been an attempt at escape, merely more
frustration than she could bear. Her days began and ended with
exhaustion, every day more than the last. She could not remember
how long since they had stuffed her into that coarse black robe;
the days ran together like an everlasting stream. A week? A month?
Maybe not that long. Surely not more. She wished she had never
touched Belinde. If the woman had not stuffed rags into her mouth
to silence her sobbing, she would have begged to be allowed to
carry rocks again, or move a pile of pebbles stone by stone, or any
of the tortures they filled her hours with. Anything rather than
this.</p>

<p>Only Galina&rsquo;s head stuck out of the leather sack
that hung suspended from the stout limb of an oak. Directly beneath
the sack, coals glowed in a bronze brazier, a slow burn, heating
the air inside the sack. She huddled in that sweltering heat with
her thumbs tied to her toes, sweat slicking her nakedness. Her hair
clung damply to her face, and she panted, nostrils flaring for air,
when she was not sobbing. Even so, this would have been better than
the endless, senseless, backbreaking labor they subjected her to
except for one thing. Before snugging the neck of the sack beneath
her chin, Belinde had emptied a pouch of some fine powder over her,
and as she had begun to sweat, it had begun to burn like pepper
flung in the eyes. It seemed to coat her from the shoulders down,
and, oh, Light, it burned!</p>

<p>That she called on the Light measured her
desperation, but they had not broken her for all their trying. She
<em>would</em> get free&mdash;she would!&mdash;and once she did,
she would make these savages pay in blood! Rivers of blood! Oceans!
She would have them all skinned alive! She would&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;! Flinging
back her head, she howled; the wadded rags in her mouth muffled the
sound, but she howled, and she did not know whether it was a shriek
of rage or a scream for mercy.</p>

<p>When her howls died and her head fell forward,
Belinde and the Maidens were on their feet, and Sevanna was with
them. Galina attempted to stifle her sobbing in front of the
golden-haired woman, but she could as soon have plucked the sun
from the sky with her fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen to her whine and snivel,&rdquo; Sevanna sneered,
coming to look up at her. Galina tried to put an equal contempt in
her own stare. Sevanna decked herself with enough jewelry for ten
women! She wore her blouse unlaced to nearly bare her bosom, except
for all those mismatched necklaces, and breathed deep when men
looked at her! Galina tried, but contempt was hard to manage with
tears rolling down her cheeks along with her sweat. She shook with
weeping, making the sack sway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This <em>da&rsquo;tsang</em> is tough as an old ewe,&rdquo;
Belinde cackled, &ldquo;but I always found even the toughest old ewe was
made tender if cooked slowly, with the right herbs. When I was a
Maiden, I softened Stone Dogs with enough cooking.&rdquo; Galina closed
her eyes. <em>Oceans</em> of blood, to pay for&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!</p>

<p>The sack lurched, and Galina&rsquo;s eyes popped open
as it began to settle. The Maidens had undone the rope running over
the limb, and the pair of them were lowering her slowly.
Frantically she thrashed about, trying to look down, and almost
began sobbing anew, with relief, when she saw that the brazier had
been moved aside. With Belinde&rsquo;s talk of cooking&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;That
would be Belinde&rsquo;s fate, Galina decided. Tied to a spit and
turned over a fire until her juices dripped! That to begin!</p>

<p>With a thud that made Galina grunt, the leather bag
hit the ground and toppled over. As unconcerned as if they were
handling a sack of potatoes, the Maidens tumbled her out onto the
brown weeds, sliced the cords that held her thumbs and toes,
plucked the gag from between her teeth. Dirt and dead leaves stuck
to the sweat coating her.</p>

<p>She very much wanted to stand, to meet them all
eye-to-eye and glare-for-glare. Instead, she rose only as far as
hands and knees, then dug her fingers into the mulch of the forest
floor, dug her toes in. Any further, and she would not be able to
stop her hands from flying to soothe her red, flaming skin. Her
sweat felt like the juice of ice peppers. All she could do was
crouch there and quiver, try to work some moisture back into her
mouth and daydream of what she would do to these savages.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believed you were stronger than this,&rdquo; Sevanna
said above her in thoughtful tones, &ldquo;but perhaps Belinde is right.
Perhaps you are soft enough, now. If you swear to obey me, you can
stop being <em>da&rsquo;tsang</em>. Perhaps you will not even have
to be <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>. Will you swear to obey me in all
things?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; The hoarse word flew from Galina&rsquo;s tongue
without hesitation, though she had to swallow before speaking more.
&ldquo;I will obey you! I swear it!&rdquo; And so she would obey. Until they
gave the opening she needed. Was this all that had been necessary?
An oath she would have made the first day? Sevanna would learn what
it was like to hang over hot coals. Oh, yes, she&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you will not object to swearing your oath on
this,&rdquo; Sevanna said, tossing something down in front of her.</p>

<p>Galina&rsquo;s scalp crawled as she stared at it. A
white rod like polished ivory, a foot long and no thicker than her
wrist. Then she saw the flowing marks carved into the end toward
her, numerals used in the Age of Legends. One hundred eleven. She
had thought it was the Oath Rod, somehow stolen from the White
Tower. That also was marked, but with the numeral three, which some
thought stood for the Three Oaths. Maybe this was not what it
seemed. Maybe. Yet no hooded viper from the Drowned Lands coiled
there could have frozen her so still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fine oath, Sevanna. When did you intend to tell
the rest of us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That voice jerked Galina&rsquo;s head up. It could
have pulled her eyes away from a hooded viper, too.</p>

<p>Therava appeared among the trees leading a dozen
cold-faced Wise Ones. When they stopped behind her, confronting
Sevanna, every woman present except for the Maidens had been there
when Galina was sentenced to wear the black robe. A word from
Therava, a short nod from Sevanna, and the Maidens departed
swiftly. Sweat still oozed from Galina, but suddenly the air seemed
cold.</p>

<p>Sevanna glanced at Belinde, who avoided her eye.
Sevanna&rsquo;s lip curled, half sneer, half snarl, and she planted
fists on hips. Galina did not understand where she found the nerve,
a woman who could not channel at all. Some of these women possessed
not inconsiderable strength. No, she could not afford to think of
them only as wilders if she was to escape and have her revenge.
Therava and Someryn were stronger than any woman in the Tower, and
any of them could have been Aes Sedai easily.</p>

<p>But Sevanna faced them defiantly. &ldquo;It seems you
rendered justice quickly,&rdquo; she said in a voice dry as dust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The matter was simple,&rdquo; Tion replied calmly. &ldquo;The
<em>Mera&rsquo;din</em> received the justice they deserved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And they were told they received it in <em>
spite</em> of your attempt to sway us,&rdquo; Rhiale added with some
heat. Sevanna nearly <em>did</em> snarl at that.</p>

<p>Therava would not be diverted from her purpose,
though. In one swift step she reached Galina, gripped a handful of
her hair and jerked her up to her knees, bent her head back.
Therava was not the tallest of these women by at least a head, yet
she loomed taller than most men, staring down with a hawk&rsquo;s
eyes, driving away every thought of revenge or defiance. The white
streaks touching her dark red hair only made her face more
commanding. Galina&rsquo;s hands clenched into fists on her thighs,
nails digging into her palms. Even the burning of her skin paled
under that stare. She had daydreamed about breaking every one of
these women, making them plead for death, laughing as she denied
their begging. About every one except Therava. At night, Therava
filled her dreams and all Galina could do was try to flee; the only
escape was to wake screaming. Galina had broken strong men and
strong women, but she stared up at Therava wide-eyed and
whined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This one has no honor to shame.&rdquo; Therava almost spat
the words. &ldquo;If you want her broken, Sevanna, let me have her. When
I am done, she will obey without the need for your friend
Caddar&rsquo;s toy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sevanna spoke up heatedly, denying friendship with
this Caddar, whoever he was, and Rhiale barked that Sevanna had
brought him to the others, and others began arguing about whether
the &ldquo;binder&rdquo; would work any better than the &ldquo;traveling box.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A small part of Galina&rsquo;s mind seized on mention
of the traveling box. She had heard it spoken of before, longed to
lay hands on it if only for a moment. With a <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em> that enabled her to Travel, however
imperfectly it seemed to work, she would be able to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Even hope
of escape could not stand against thoughts of what Therava would do
to her if the others decided to give in to the woman&rsquo;s
request. When the hawk-eyed Wise One loosed her hair to join the
argument, Galina hurled herself at the rod, landing flat on her
belly. Anything, even having to obey Sevanna, was better than being
handed over to Therava. If she had not been shielded, she would
have channeled to operate the rod herself.</p>

<p>No sooner did her fingers close on the smooth rod
than Therava&rsquo;s foot came down on it hard, trapping her hands
painfully against the ground. None of the Wise Ones so much as
glanced at her where she lay writhing, trying futilely to pull
free. She could not make herself pull too hard; dimly she could
recall making rulers pale with fear, but she did not dare disturb
this woman&rsquo;s foot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she is to swear,&rdquo; Therava said, staring hard at
Sevanna, &ldquo;it should be to obey all of us here.&rdquo; The others nodded,
some voicing agreement, all but Belinde, and she pursed her lips
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Sevanna stared back just as hard. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she
acceded finally. &ldquo;But me first among us. I am not only a Wise One;
I speak as the clan chief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Therava smiled thinly. &ldquo;So you do. Two among us
first, Sevanna. You and I.&rdquo; Not a whisper of defiance faded from
Sevanna&rsquo;s face, but she nodded. Grudgingly. Only then did
Therava move her foot. The light of <em>saidar</em> surrounded her,
and a flow of Spirit touched the numerals at the end of the rod in
Galina&rsquo;s hands. Just as was done with the Oath Rod.</p>

<p>For an instant, Galina hesitated, flexing mashed
fingers. It felt the same as the Oath Rod, too; not quite like
ivory, not quite like glass, distinctly cool on her palms. If it
was a second Oath Rod, it could be used to remove any oath she
swore now. If she were given the opportunity. She did not want to
take the chance, did not want to swear to Therava in any case.
Always before this in her life, <em>she</em> had commanded; life
since her capture had been misery, but Therava would make her a
lapdog! Yet if she did not, would they let Therava break her? She
could not find the smallest particle of doubt that the woman would
do just that. Utterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Under the Light and by my hope of salvation and
rebirth&rdquo;&mdash;she no longer believed in the Light or a hope of
salvation, and there was no need to speak more than a simple
promise, but they expected a strong oath&mdash;&ldquo;I swear to obey
every Wise One present here in all things, and first among them,
Therava and Sevanna.&rdquo; The last hope that this &ldquo;binder&rdquo; was
something else vanished as Galina felt the oath settle on her, as
if she suddenly wore a garment that covered her far too tightly
from her scalp to the soles of her feet. Throwing back her head,
she screamed. In part that was because it suddenly seemed as if the
burning of her skin was being pressed deep into her flesh, but
mainly, it was pure despair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet!&rdquo; Therava said sharply. &ldquo;I do not want to
listen to you wailing!&rdquo; Galina&rsquo;s teeth clicked shut, nearly
biting her tongue, and she struggled to swallow her sobs. Nothing
but obedience was possible, now. Therava frowned at her. &ldquo;Let us
see if this truly works,&rdquo; she muttered, bending closer. &ldquo;Have you
planned violence against any Wise One here? Answer truthfully, and
ask to be punished if you have. The penalty for violence against a
Wise One,&rdquo; she added like an afterthought, &ldquo;can be to be killed
like an animal.&rdquo; She drew a finger expressively across her throat
then gripped her belt knife with the same hand.</p>

<p>Gulping air in horrified panic, Galina shied back
from the woman. She could not take her eyes away from
Therava&rsquo;s, though, and she could not stop the words that
chattered through her teeth. &ldquo;I d-did, ag-g-gainst all of you!
P-please p-punish me f-for it!&rdquo; Would they kill her, now? After all
of this, was she to die here?</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems this binder does as your friend claimed
after all, Sevanna.&rdquo; Plucking the rod from Galina&rsquo;s limp
hands, Therava tucked it behind her belt as she straightened. &ldquo;It
also seems that you will wear white after all, Galina Casban.&rdquo; For
some reason, she gave a pleased smile at that. But she issued other
commands, too. &ldquo;You will behave meekly, as a <em>
gai&rsquo;shain</em> should. If a <em>child</em> tells you to jump,
you will jump unless one of us has said otherwise. And you will not
touch <em>saidar</em> or channel unless one of us tells you.
Release the shield on her, Belinde.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The shield vanished, and Galina knelt there, staring
hollowly. The Source shone just out of sight, tantalizing. And she
could have sprouted wings as easily as she could stretch out for
it.</p>

<p>Bracelets clattered as Sevanna shifted her shawl in
anger. &ldquo;You take too much on yourself, Therava. That is mine; give
it to me!&rdquo; She held out her hand, but Therava merely folded her
arms beneath her breasts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There have been meetings among the Wise Ones,&rdquo; the
stern-eyed woman told Sevanna. &ldquo;We have reached certain decisions.&rdquo;
The women who had come with her gathered behind her, all of them
facing Sevanna, and Belinde hurried to join them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without me?&rdquo; Sevanna snapped. &ldquo;Do any of you dare
reach a decision without me?&rdquo; Her tone remained as strong as ever,
but her eyes flickered to the rod in Therava&rsquo;s belt, and
Galina thought there was a touch of uneasiness there. Another time,
she would have been delighted to see it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One decision had to be reached without you,&rdquo; Tion
said in a flat voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you so often point out, you speak as the clan
chief,&rdquo; Emerys added, a mocking light in her big gray eyes.
&ldquo;Sometimes, Wise Ones must talk without a clan chief listening. Or
someone who speaks as a chief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We decided,&rdquo; Therava said, &ldquo;that just as a clan
chief must have a Wise One to advise him, so must you have a Wise
One&rsquo;s advice. <em>I</em> will advise you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gathering her shawl around her, Sevanna studied the
women confronting her. Her expression was unreadable. How did she
do it? They could crush her like an egg beneath a hammer. &ldquo;And what
<em>advice</em> do you offer me, Therava?&rdquo; she said at last in an
icy voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My strong advice is that we move without delay,&rdquo;
Therava replied, as cool as Sevanna. &ldquo;These Seanchan are too close
and too many. We should move north into these Mountains of Mist and
establish a hold. From there, we can send parties to find the other
septs. It may take long to reunite the Shaido, Sevanna. Your
wetlander friend may have scattered us to the nine corners of the
world. Until we do that, we are vulnerable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will move tomorrow.&rdquo; If Galina had not been sure
she knew Sevanna inside and out, she would have thought the woman
sounded petulant as well as angry. Those green eyes flashed. &ldquo;But
east. That also is away from the Seanchan, and the lands to the
east are in turmoil, ripe for plucking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a long silence, then Therava nodded.
&ldquo;East.&rdquo; She said the word softly, the softness of silk laid over
steel. &ldquo;But remember that clan chiefs have lived to regret
rejecting a Wise One&rsquo;s advice too often. You may, as well.&rdquo;
The threat on her face was plain as that in her voice, yet Sevanna
laughed!</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>You</em> remember, Therava! All of you remember!
If I am left for the vultures, so will you be! I have made
assurance of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other women exchanged worried glances, all but
Therava, and Modarra and Norlea frowned.</p>

<p>Slumped on her knees, whimpering and trying in vain
to soothe her skin with her hands, Galina found herself wondering
what these threats meant. It was a small thought, worming its way
through bitterness and self-pity. Anything she could use against
these women would be welcome. If she dared use it. A bitter
thought.</p>

<p>Abruptly she realized that the sky was turning dark.
Billowing clouds were rolling down from the north, streaked gray
and black, obscuring the sun. And beneath the clouds fell flurries
of snow, swirling in the air. None reached the ground&mdash;few
fell as far as the treetops&mdash;but Galina gaped. Snow! Had the
Great Lord loosened his grip on the world for some reason?</p>

<p>The Wise Ones stared at the sky, too, mouths hanging
open as if they had never seen clouds, much less snow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this, Galina Casban?&rdquo; Therava demanded.
&ldquo;Speak if you know!&rdquo; She did not look away from the sky until
Galina told her it was snow, and when she did it was to laugh. &ldquo;I
always thought the men who ran down Laman Treekiller lied about
snow. This could not hamper a mouse!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Galina clamped her jaws shut on explaining about
snowfalls, aghast that her instinct had been to curry favor. Aghast
as well at the small pang of pleasure that keeping the information
back gave. <em>I am the Highest of the Red Ajah!</em> she reminded
herself. <em>I sit on the Supreme Council of the Black Ajah!</em>
They sounded like lies. This was not fair!</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we are done here,&rdquo; Sevanna said, &ldquo;I will take the
<em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> back to the great roof and see her put in
white. You can remain and stare at the snow if you wish.&rdquo; Her tone
was so smooth, like butter in the tub, that no one would have
thought her at daggers&rsquo; points only moments earlier. She
looped her shawl over her elbows and adjusted some of her
necklaces; nothing in the world concerned her more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will take care of the <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>,&rdquo;
Therava told her just as smoothly. &ldquo;Since you speak as the chief,
you have a long day and most of the night ahead of you if we are to
move tomorrow.&rdquo; For an instant, Sevanna&rsquo;s eyes flashed again,
but Therava merely snapped her fingers and gestured sharply at
Galina before turning to go. &ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And stop
pouting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Head down, Galina scrambled to her feet and scurried
after Therava and the other women who could channel. Pouting? She
might have been scowling, but never pouting! Her thoughts scrabbled
like rats in a cage, finding no hope of escape. There had to be
one! There had to be! One thought that surfaced in the middle of
that turmoil almost made her begin weeping again. Were <em>
gai&rsquo;shain</em> robes softer than the scratchy black wool she
had been forced to wear so far? There had to be a way out! A hasty
glance back through the trees showed Sevanna still standing there,
glaring after them. Overhead, the clouds swirled, and the falling
snow melted like Galina&rsquo;s hopes.</p>
