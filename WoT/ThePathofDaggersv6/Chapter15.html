the dim, cold dark of deep night, Egwene woke
groggily from restless sleep and troubling dreams, the more
troubling because she could not remember them. Her dreams were
always open to her, as clear as printed words on a page, yet these
had been murky and fearful. She had had too many of those, lately.
They left her wanting to run, to escape, never able to recall what
from, but always queasy and uncertain, even trembling. At least her
head was not hurting. At least she could recall the dreams she knew
must be significant, though not how to interpret them. Rand,
wearing different masks, until suddenly one of those false faces
was no longer a mask, but him. Perrin and a Tinker, frenziedly
hacking their way through brambles with axe and sword, unaware of
the cliff that lay just ahead. And the brambles screamed with human
voices they did not hear. Mat, weighing two Aes Sedai on a huge set
of balance scales, and on his decision depended&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She could not
say what; something vast; the world, perhaps. There had been other
dreams, most tinged with suffering. Recently, all of her dreams
about Mat were pale and full of pain, like shadows cast by
nightmares, almost as though Mat himself were not quite real. That
made her afraid for him, left behind in Ebou Dar, and gave her
agonies of grief for sending him there, not to mention poor old
Thom Merrilin. But the unremembered dreams were worse, she was
sure.</p>

<p>The sound of low voices arguing had wakened her, and
the full moon was still up outside, casting enough light for her to
make out two women confronting one another at the tent&rsquo;s
entrance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The poor woman&rsquo;s head pains her all day, and
she gets little rest at night,&rdquo; Halima whispered fiercely, fists on
her hips. &ldquo;Let this wait till morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t propose to argue with you.&rdquo;
Siuan&rsquo;s voice was winter itself, and she tossed back her cloak
with a mittened hand as though preparing to fight. She was dressed
for the weather, in stout wool no doubt worn over as many shifts as
she could fit underneath. &ldquo;You stand aside, and right quick, or
I&rsquo;ll have your guts for bait! And put on some decent
clothes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a soft laugh, Halima drew up and if anything
planted herself more squarely in Siuan&rsquo;s way. Her white
nightgown clung, but was decent enough for its purpose. Though it
did seem a wonder she evaded freezing in that thin silk. The coals
in the tripod braziers had died down long since, and neither
much-mended tent canvas nor layered carpets on the ground held in
warmth any longer. Both women&rsquo;s breath was pale mist.</p>

<p>Throwing off the blankets, Egwene sat up wearily on
her narrow cot. Halima was a country woman with a skim of
sophistication, and often she did not seem to realize the deference
due to Aes Sedai, or indeed seem to think she need defer to anyone.
She spoke to Sitters as she might to the goodwives in her own
village, with a laugh and a level eye and a straightforward
earthiness that sometimes shocked. Siuan spent her days giving way
to women who had jumped at her word a year earlier, smiling and
curtsying for nearly every sister in the camp. Many still laid much
of the Tower&rsquo;s troubles at her feet and thought she had hardly
suffered enough to atone. Sufficient to keep anyone&rsquo;s pride at
a stiff prickle. Together, the pair were a lantern tossed into the
back of an Illuminator&rsquo;s wagon, but Egwene hoped to avoid an
explosion. Besides, Siuan would not have come in the middle of the
night unless it was necessary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go back to bed, Halima,&rdquo; Smothering a yawn, Egwene
bent to fumble her shoes and stockings from beneath the cot. She
did not channel a lamp alight. Better if no one noticed that the
Amyrlin was awake. &ldquo;Go on; you need your rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Halima protested, perhaps more strongly than she
should have to the Amyrlin Seat, but soon enough she was back on
the tiny cot that had been squeezed into the tent for her. Very
little room remained to move in, with a washstand, a stand-mirror
and a real armchair, plus four large chests stacked atop one
another. Those held the constant flow of clothes from Sitters who
had not yet realized that however young Egwene might be, she was
not young enough to be dazzled or diverted by silks and laces.
Halima lay curled up, watching in the darkness, while Egwene
hastily dragged an ivory comb through her hair, donned stout
mittens, and pulled a fox-lined cloak over her nightgown. A thick
woolen nightgown, and she would not have minded thicker in this
weather. Halima&rsquo;s eyes seemed to pick up the faint moonlight
and shine darkly, unblinking.</p>

<p>Egwene did not think the woman jealous of her place
near the Amyrlin Seat, casual as it was, and the Light knew she did
not carry gossip, but Halima had an innocent curiosity about
everything, whether or not it was any of her business. Reason
enough to hear Siuan out elsewhere. Everyone knew now that Siuan
had thrown in her lot with Egwene, after a fashion, as they
thought, sullenly and grudgingly. A figure of some amusement and
occasional pity, Siuan Sanche, reduced to attaching herself to the
woman who held the title once hers, and that woman no more than a
puppet once the Hall finished fighting over who would pull her
cords. Siuan was human enough to harbor sparks of resentment, but
so far they had managed to keep secret that her advice was far from
grudging. So she endured pity and snickers as best she could, and
everyone believed her as changed by her experiences as her face.
That belief had to be maintained, or Romanda and Lelaine and very
likely the rest of the Hall, too, would find ways to separate her&mdash;and her advice&mdash;from Egwene.</p>

<p>The cold outside slapped Egwene in the face and
flooded under her cloak; her nightgown might as well have been
Halima&rsquo;s for all the protection it offered. Despite stout
leather and good wool, her feet felt as if they were bare. Tendrils
of frosty air curled around her ears, mocking the thick fur lining
her hood. Yearning for her bed as she was, ignoring the iciness
took all the concentration she could muster. Clouds scudded across
the sky, and moon-shadows floated over the gleaming white that
covered the ground, a smooth sheet broken by the dark mounds of
tents and the taller shapes of canvas-topped wagons that now had
long wooden runners in place of wheels. Many of the wagons were no
longer parked apart from the tents, but left where they had been
unloaded; no one had the heart to make the wagon drivers put out
even that much extra effort at the end of the day. Nothing moved
except those pale sliding shadows. The wide runnels that had been
trampled through the camp for paths lay empty. The silence was
crisp and so deep that she almost regretted breaking it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked softly, casting a wary glance
at the small tent nearby shared by her maids, Chesa, Meri, and
Selame. That was as still and dark as the others. Exhaustion made
as thick a blanket over the camp as the snow. &ldquo;Not another
revelation like the Kin, I hope.&rdquo; She clicked her tongue in
vexation. She was spent, too, by long freezing days in the saddle
and not enough real sleep, or she would not have said that.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Siuan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No need to apologize, Mother.&rdquo; Siuan kept her voice
down as well, and glanced about to see whether anyone might be
watching from the shadows besides. Neither wanted to find herself
discussing the Kin with the Hall. &ldquo;I know I should have told you
beforehand, but it seemed a small thing. I never expected those
girls to even speak to one of them. There&rsquo;s so much to tell
you. I have to try to pick and choose what&rsquo;s important.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With an effort, Egwene managed not to sigh. That was
almost word for word the apology Siuan had offered before. Several
times. What she meant was that she was trying to force-feed Egwene
over twenty years of experience as Aes Sedai, more than ten of that
as Amyrlin, and do it in months. At times Egwene felt like a goose
being fattened for market. &ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s important
tonight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gareth Bryne&rsquo;s waiting in your study.&rdquo; Siuan
did not raise her voice, but it took on an edge, as always when she
spoke of Lord Bryne. She tossed her head angrily inside the deep
hood of her cloak, and made a sound like a cat spitting. &ldquo;The man
came in dripping snow, scooped me out of my bedding, and barely
gave me time to dress before hauling me up behind his saddle. He
told me nothing; just tossed me down at the edge of camp and sent
me to fetch you like I was a serving girl!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Firmly, Egwene stifled a rising hope. There had been
too many disappointments, and whatever had brought Bryne in the
middle of the night was much more likely to be a potential disaster
than what she wished for. How far yet to the border with Andor?
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what he wants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Starting off toward the tent everyone named the
Amyrlin&rsquo;s Study, she held her cloak close. She did not shiver,
but refusing to let heat or cold touch you did not make them go
away. You could ignore them right up to the moment sunstroke cooked
your brain or frostbite rotted your hands and feet. She considered
what Siuan had said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t sleeping in your own tent here?&rdquo;
she said carefully. The other woman&rsquo;s relation to Lord Bryne
<em>was</em> that of a servant, in a very peculiar way, but Egwene
hoped Siuan was not letting her stubborn pride lead her into
letting him take advantage. She could not imagine it, of him or
her, yet not so long ago she could not have imagined Siuan
accepting any part of the situation. She still could not understand
why.</p>

<p>Snorting loudly, Siuan kicked her skirts, and nearly
fell as her shoes skidded. Snow beaten down by countless feet had
quickly become a rough sheet of ice. Egwene was picking her own way
cautiously. Every day brought broken bones that travel-weary
sisters had to Heal. Half abandoning her cloak, she offered an arm
as much for the support she might receive as give. Siuan took it,
muttering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the time I finished cleaning the man&rsquo;s spare
boots and second saddle, it was too late to tramp back through
this. Not that he offered more than blankets in a corner; not
Gareth Bryne! Made me dig them out of the chest myself, while <em>
he</em> went off the Light knows where! Men are a trial, and that
one the worst!&rdquo; Without a pause for breath, she changed the
subject. &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t let that Halima sleep in your tent.
She&rsquo;s another pair of ears you have to be careful of, and
snoopy with it. Besides, you&rsquo;re lucky you don&rsquo;t walk in
to find her <em>entertaining</em> some soldier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very glad that Delana can spare Halima nights,&rdquo;
Egwene said firmly. &ldquo;I need her. Unless you think Nisao&rsquo;s
Healing might do better with my headaches a second time around.&rdquo;
Halima&rsquo;s fingers seemed to draw the pain out through her
scalp; without that, she would not be able to sleep at all.
Nisao&rsquo;s effort had had no effect whatsoever, and she was the
only Yellow Egwene dared approach with the problem. As for the rest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She made her voice sterner still. &ldquo;I am surprised you&rsquo;re
still listening to that gossip, daughter. The fact that men like
looking at a woman doesn&rsquo;t mean she invites it, as you should
know well. I&rsquo;ve seen more than a few looking at you and
grinning.&rdquo; Taking that tone came easier than it once had.</p>

<p>Siuan gave her a startled sidelong glance and, after
a moment, grumbled an apology. It might have been sincere. Egwene
accepted it, either way. Lord Bryne was very bad for Siuan&rsquo;s
temper, and tossing Halima into the bargain, Egwene thought it a
good job she was not pushed into taking a stricter stance. Siuan
herself had said that she should not put up with nonsense, and she
surely could not afford to put up with it from Siuan, of all
people.</p>

<p>Trudging arm-in-arm, they went on in silence, the
cold fogging their breath and seeping through their flesh. The snow
was a curse and a lesson. She could still hear Siuan going on about
what she called the Law of Unintended Consequences, stronger than
any written law. <em>Whether or not what you do has the effect you
want, it will have three at least you never expected, and one of
those usually unpleasant</em>.</p>

<p>The first, feeble rains had brought astonishment, for
all Egwene had already informed the Hall that the Bowl of the Winds
had been found and used. That was almost as much as she could risk
letting them know of what Elayne had told her in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>; too much of what had happened in
Ebou Dar was just the thing to cut her feet out from under her
here, and her position was precarious enough as it was. An
explosion of joy erupted at those first sprinkles. They had halted
the march at midday, and there had been bonfires and feasting in
the drizzle, prayers of thanksgiving among the sisters and dancing
among the servants and the soldiers. For that matter, some of the
Aes Sedai had danced, too.</p>

<p>A few days later, the soft rains became downpours,
and then howling tempests. The temperature slid downward,
plummeted, and tempests became blizzards. Now, the distance once
covered in a day, with Egwene gritting her teeth over how slowly
they moved, took five when the sky held only clouds, and when the
snows fell, they did not move at all. Easy enough to think of three
unintended consequences, or more, and the snow might well be the
least unpleasant.</p>

<p>As they approached the small, patched tent called the
Amyrlin&rsquo;s Study, a shadow moved beside one of the tall wagons,
and Egwene&rsquo;s breath caught. The shadow became a figure who
slipped back her hood enough to reveal Leane&rsquo;s face, then
pulled back into darkness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll keep a watch and let us know if anybody
comes,&rdquo; Siuan said softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; Egwene muttered. The woman <em>
could</em> have told her in advance. She had half been afraid it
was Romanda or Lelaine!</p>

<p>The Amyrlin&rsquo;s Study was dark, but Lord Bryne
stood waiting patiently inside, wrapped in his cloak, a shadow
among shadows. Embracing the Source, Egwene channeled, not to light
the lantern hanging from the centerpole or one of the candles, but
to make a small sphere of pale light that she suspended in the air
over the folding table she used as a writing desk. Very small, and
very pale; unlikely to be noticed from outside, and quick as
thought to extinguish. She could not afford discovery.</p>

<p>There had been Amyrlins who reigned in strength,
Amyrlins who managed an even balance with the Hall, and Amyrlins
who had had as little power as she, or less upon rare occasions,
well-hidden in the secret histories of the White Tower. Several had
frittered away power and influence, falling from strength to
weakness, but in over three thousand years, precious few had
managed to move in the other direction. Egwene very much wished she
knew how Myriam Copan and the rest of that bare handful had
managed. If anyone had ever thought to write that down, the pages
were long lost.</p>

<p>Bowing respectfully, Bryne showed no surprise at her
caution. He knew what she put at hazard, meeting him secretly. To a
very large degree, she trusted this sturdy, heavily graying man
with the bluff, weathered face, and not only because she had to.
His cloak was thick red wool, lined with marten and bordered with
the Flame of Tar Valon, a gift from the Hall, yet he had made plain
a dozen times in the past weeks that whatever the Hall thought&mdash;and he was not blind enough to have missed that!&mdash;she
was the Amyrlin, and he followed the Amyrlin. Oh, he had never said
so right out, but with carefully worded hints that left no doubts.
Expecting more would have been expecting too much. There were
nearly as many undercurrents in the camp as there were Aes Sedai,
some strong enough to pull him down. Several strong enough to mire
her deeper than she was, if the Hall learned of this meeting. She
trusted him further than anyone except Siuan and Leane, or Elayne
and Nynaeve, maybe further than any of the sisters who had sworn
fealty to her in secret, and she wished she had the courage to
trust him more. The ball of white light cast weak, fitful
shadows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have news, Lord Bryne?&rdquo; she asked, stifling
hope. She could think of a dozen possible messages that might bring
him in the night, each with its own set of pitfalls and snares. Had
Rand decided to add more crowns to that of Illian, or the Seanchan
somehow captured still another city, or the Band of the Red Hand
suddenly moved on its own instead of shadowing the Aes Sedai, or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An army lies north of us, Mother,&rdquo; he replied
calmly. His leather-gauntleted hands rested lightly atop his long
sword hilt. An army to the north, a little more snow, all the same.
&ldquo;Andorans, mainly, but with a goodly number of Murandians. My deep
scouts brought the news less than an hour ago. Pelivar leads, and
Arathelle is with him, the High Seats of two of the strongest
Houses in Andor, and they&rsquo;ve brought twenty more at least.
They&rsquo;re pushing south hard, it seems. If you keep on as you
are, which I advise against, we should meet head-on in two days,
three at the outside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene kept her face smooth, suppressing her relief.
What she had been hoping for, waiting for; what she had begun to
fear might never come. Surprisingly, it was Siuan who gasped, and
clapped a mittened hand over her mouth too late. Bryne cocked at
eyebrow at her, but she recovered quickly, putting on Aes Sedai
serenity so thick you almost forgot her youthful face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you have qualms at fighting your fellow
Andorans?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;Speak up, man. I&rsquo;m not your
washwoman here.&rdquo; Well, there was a small crack in that
serenity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you command, Siuan Sedai.&rdquo; Bryne&rsquo;s tone held
no scrap of mockery, yet Siuan&rsquo;s mouth began to tighten, her
outward coolness evaporating fast. He made her a small bow,
workmanlike but acceptable. &ldquo;I will fight whoever the Mother wishes
me to fight, of course.&rdquo; Even here, he would not be more
forthcoming. Men learned caution around Aes Sedai. So did women.
Egwene thought caution had become a second skin for her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if we don&rsquo;t keep on?&rdquo; she said. So much
planning, just her and Siuan and sometimes Leane, and now she still
had to feel out each step as carefully as on those icy paths
outside. &ldquo;If we stop here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not hesitate. &ldquo;If you have a way to bring them
around without fighting, all well and good, but some time tomorrow
they&rsquo;ll reach an excellent position to defend, one flank held
by the River Armahn, the other by a large peat bog, and small
streams in front to break up attacks. Pelivar will settle in there
to wait; he knows the work. Arathelle will have her part if
there&rsquo;s talking, but she&rsquo;ll leave the pikes and swords to
him. We can&rsquo;t reach it ahead of him, and anyway, the terrain
is no use to us there, with him to the north. If you mean to fight,
I advise making for that ridge we crossed two days back. We can
reach it in good order ahead of them if we start at dawn, and
Pelivar would think twice about coming at us there if he had three
times the numbers he does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wriggling near-frozen toes inside her stockings,
Egwene let out an annoyed sigh. There was a difference between not
letting cold touch you and not feeling it. Picking her way
carefully, not letting herself be distracted by the chill, she
asked, &ldquo;<em>Will</em> they talk, offered the chance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably, Mother. The Murandians hardly count;
they&rsquo;re just there for whatever advantage they can wring out
of the situation, same as their countrymen under me. It&rsquo;s
Pelivar and Arathelle who matter. If I had to wager, I&rsquo;d say
they only mean to keep you out of Andor.&rdquo; He shook his head grimly.
&ldquo;But they&rsquo;ll fight if they have to, if they must, maybe even
if it means facing Aes Sedai instead of just soldiers. I expect
they&rsquo;ve heard the same tales we have about that battle out
east somewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fish guts!&rdquo; Siuan growled. So much for calm.
&ldquo;Half-baked rumors and raw gossip are no proof there <em>was</em>
any battle, you lummox, and if there was, sisters wouldn&rsquo;t
have gotten themselves mixed up in it!&rdquo; The man truly was an
occasion of sin for her.</p>

<p>Strangely, Bryne smiled. He often did when Siuan
showed her temper. Anywhere else, on anyone else, Egwene would have
called the smile fond. &ldquo;Better for us if they believe,&rdquo; he told
Siuan mildly. Her face darkened so, you might have thought he had
sneered at her.</p>

<p>Why did a normally sensible woman let Bryne get under
her skin? Whatever the reason, Egwene had no time for it tonight.
&ldquo;Siuan, I see someone forgot to take away the mulled wine. It
can&rsquo;t have soured in this weather. Warm it for us, please.&rdquo;
She did not like setting the other woman down in front of Bryne,
but she had to be reined in, and this seemed the gentlest way to do
it. Really, they should not have left the silver pitcher on her
table.</p>

<p>Siuan did not quite flinch, but from her stricken
expression, quickly smoothed over, you would never have believed
she washed the man&rsquo;s smallclothes. Without comment she
channeled slightly to reheat the wine in the silver pitcher,
quickly filled two clean worked-silver cups, and handed the first
to Egwene. She kept the second, staring at Lord Bryne as she sipped
and leaving him to pour for himself.</p>

<p>Warming her mittened fingers on her own cup, Egwene
felt a flash of irritation. Maybe it was part of Siuan&rsquo;s
long-delayed reaction to the death of her Warder. She still became
weepy for no visible reason now and then, though she tried to hide
it. Egwene put the matter out of her head. Tonight, that was an
anthill beside mountains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to avoid a battle if I can, Lord Bryne. The
army is for Tar Valon, not fighting a war here. Send to arrange a
meeting as soon as possible for the Amyrlin Seat with Lord Pelivar
and Lady Arathelle and anyone else you think you should be present.
Not here. Our ragged camp won&rsquo;t impress them very much. As
soon as possible, mind. I wouldn&rsquo;t object to tomorrow, if it
could be set.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s sooner than I can manage, Mother,&rdquo; he
said mildly. &ldquo;If I send riders out as soon as I return to camp, I
doubt they can be back with an answer much before tomorrow
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I suggest you return quickly.&rdquo; Light, but her
hands and feet felt cold. And the pit of her stomach, too. But her
voice kept its calm. &ldquo;And I want you to keep that meeting, and the
existence of their army, from the Hall as long as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This time, she was asking him to take as great a risk
as she did. Gareth Bryne was one of the best generals living, but
the Hall chafed that he did not run the army to suit them. They had
been grateful for his name in the beginning, for it helped draw
soldiers to their cause. Now the army had more than thirty thousand
armed men, with more coming even since the snows had started, and
they thought that maybe they did not need Lord Gareth Bryne any
longer. And of course, there were those who believed they never had
needed him. They would not simply send him away for this. If the
Hall chose to act, he might well go to the headsman for
treason.</p>

<p>He did not blink, and he did not ask questions.
Perhaps he knew she would not give answers. Or maybe he thought he
knew them. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much traffic between my camp and
yours, but too many men know already to keep a secret long. I will
do what I can, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As simple as that. The first step down a road that
would see her on the Amyrlin Seat in Tar Valon, or else deliver her
firmly into the grasp of the Hall, with nothing left to decide
except whether it was Romanda or Lelaine who told her what to do.
Somehow, such a pivotal moment should have been accompanied by
fanfares of trumpets, or at the least, thunder in the sky. It was
always that way in stories.</p>

<p>Egwene let the ball of light vanish, but as Bryne
turned to leave, she caught his arm. It was like catching a thick
tree branch through his coat. &ldquo;A thing I have been meaning to ask
you, Lord Bryne. You can&rsquo;t want to take men worn down by
marching right into a siege of Tar Valon. How long would you want
to rest them before you began?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the first time, he paused, and she wished she
still had the light to see his face. She thought he frowned. &ldquo;Even
leaving people in the pay of the Tower out of it,&rdquo; he said at last,
slowly, &ldquo;news of an army flies as fast as a falcon. Elaida will
know to the day when we&rsquo;ll arrive, and she won&rsquo;t give us
an hour. You know she&rsquo;s increasing the Tower Guard? To fifty
thousand men, apparently. But a month, if I could, to rest and
recover. Ten days would do, but a month would be better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She nodded, releasing him. That casual question about
the Tower Guard hurt. He was aware that the Hall and the Ajahs told
her what they wanted her to know and no more. &ldquo;I suppose
you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; she said evenly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no time for
rest once we reach Tar Valon. Send your fastest riders. There
won&rsquo;t be any difficulty, will there? Pelivar and Arathelle
will hear them out?&rdquo; She did not feign the touch of anxiety. More
than her plans might be ruined if they had to fight now.</p>

<p>Bryne&rsquo;s tone did not alter a whit that she could
tell, but somehow, he sounded soothing. &ldquo;So long as there is light
enough for them to see the white feathers, they&rsquo;ll recognize a
truce and listen. I&rsquo;d better go, Mother. It&rsquo;s a long way
and hard riding, even for men with extra horses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as the tentflap fell behind him, Egwene let
out a long breath. Her shoulders were tight, and she expected her
head to start aching any moment. Bryne usually made her feel
relaxed, absorbing his sureness. Tonight, she had had to manipulate
him, and she thought he knew it. He was very observant for a man.
But too much was at stake to trust him more, until he made an open
declaration. Maybe an oath like the one Myrelle and the others had
given. Bryne followed the Amyrlin, and the army followed Bryne. If
he thought she was going to throw men away uselessly, a few words
from him could hand her to the Hall trussed like a pig on a
platter. She drank deeply, feeling the warmth of the spiced wine
spread through her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better for us if they believed,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;I
wish there was something <em>for</em> them to believe. If I do
nothing else, Siuan, I hope at least I can free us from the Three
Oaths.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Siuan barked. She sounded scandalized. &ldquo;Even
trying could be disastrous, and if you succeeded&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The Light
help us, if you succeeded, you would destroy the White Tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about? I try to follow the
Oaths, Siuan, since we&rsquo;re stuck with them&mdash;for now&mdash;but the Oaths won&rsquo;t help us against the Seanchan. If
sisters have to be in danger of their lives before they can fight
back, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before we are all dead or
collared.&rdquo; For a moment she could feel the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>
around her throat again, turning her into a dog on a leash. A
well-trained and obedient dog. She was glad of the darkness, now,
hiding her trembles. Shadows obscured Siuan&rsquo;s face, save for a
soundlessly working jaw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you look at me like that, Siuan.&rdquo; It was
easier to be angry than afraid, easy to mask fear in anger. She
would never be collared like that again! &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve taken every
advantage since you were freed from the Oaths. If you hadn&rsquo;t
lied in your teeth, we&rsquo;d all be in Salidar, without an army,
sitting on our hands and waiting for a miracle. Well, you would be.
They&rsquo;d never have summoned me to be Amyrlin without your lie
about Logain and the Reds. Elaida would reign supreme, and in a
year, nobody would remember how she usurped the Amyrlin Seat. <em>
She&rsquo;d</em> destroy the Tower, for sure. You know she&rsquo;d
mishandle everything about Rand. I would not be surprised if she
had tried to kidnap him by now, except that she&rsquo;s concerned
with us. Well, maybe not kidnap, but she&rsquo;d have done
something. Likely, Aes Sedai would be fighting Asha&rsquo;man today,
and never mind Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don waiting over the
horizon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have lied when it seemed necessary,&rdquo; Siuan
breathed. &ldquo;When it seemed expedient.&rdquo; Her shoulders hunched, and
she sounded as though she were confessing crimes she did not want
to admit to herself. &ldquo;Sometimes I think it&rsquo;s become too easy
for me to decide that it&rsquo;s necessary and expedient. I&rsquo;ve
lied to almost everyone. Except you. But don&rsquo;t think it
hasn&rsquo;t occurred to me. To nudge you toward a decision, or away
from one. It wasn&rsquo;t wanting to keep your trust that stopped
me.&rdquo; Siuan&rsquo;s hand stretched out in the dark, pleading. &ldquo;The
Light knows what your trust and friendship mean to me, but it
wasn&rsquo;t that. It wasn&rsquo;t knowing that you&rsquo;d have the
hide off me in strips, or send me away, if you found out. I
realized that I had to hold on to the Oaths with somebody, or
I&rsquo;d lose myself completely. So I don&rsquo;t lie to you, or to
Gareth Bryne, whatever it costs. And as soon I can, Mother, I will
swear the Three Oaths on the Oath Rod again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Egwene asked quietly. Siuan had considered
lying to her? She <em>would</em> have had her hide for that. But
her anger was gone. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t condone lying, Siuan. Not
normally. It&rsquo;s just that sometimes, it really is necessary.&rdquo;
Her time with the Aiel flashed through her mind. &ldquo;So long as
you&rsquo;re willing to pay for it, anyway. I&rsquo;ve seen sisters
take on penance for smaller things. You are one of the first of a
new sort of Aes Sedai, Siuan, free and unbound. I believe you when
you say you won&rsquo;t lie to me.&rdquo; Or to Lord Bryne? Odd, that.
&ldquo;Why give up your freedom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give up?&rdquo; Siuan laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be giving up
nothing.&rdquo; Her back straightened, and her voice began to gain
strength, and then passion. &ldquo;The Oaths are what make us more than
simply a group of women meddling in the affairs of the world. Or
seven groups. Or fifty. The Oaths hold us together, a stated set of
beliefs that bind us all, a single thread running through every
sister, living or dead, back to the first to lay her hands on the
Oath Rod. <em>They</em> are what make us Aes Sedai, not <em>
saidar</em>. Any wilder can channel. Men may look at what we say
from six sides, but when a sister says, &lsquo;This is so,&rsquo;
they <em>know</em> it&rsquo;s true, and they trust. Because of the
Oaths. Because of the Oaths, no queen fears that sisters will lay
waste to her cities. The worst villain knows he&rsquo;s safe in his
life with a sister unless he tries to harm her. Oh, the Whitecloaks
call them lies, and some people have strange ideas about what the
Oaths entail, but there are very few places an Aes Sedai cannot go,
and be listened to, because of the Oaths. The Three Oaths are what
it is to be Aes Sedai, the <em>heart</em> of being Aes Sedai. Throw
that on the rubbish heap, and we&rsquo;ll be sand washing away in
the tide. Give up? I will be gaining.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene frowned. &ldquo;And the Seanchan?&rdquo; What it was to be
Aes Sedai. Almost from the day she first arrived in Tar Valon, she
had worked to be Aes Sedai, but she had never really thought about
what it was that <em>made</em> a woman Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>Once more Siuan laughed, though this time it was a
touch wry, and weary. She shook her head, and darkness or no,
looked tired. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Mother. The Light help me, I
don&rsquo;t. But we survived the Trolloc Wars, and Whitecloaks, and
Artur Hawkwing, and everything in between. We can find a way to
deal with these Seanchan. Without destroying ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene was not so sure. Many of the sisters in camp
thought the Seanchan were such a danger that besieging Elaida
should wait. As if waiting would not cement Elaida on the Amyrlin
Seat. Many others seemed to think that simply uniting the White
Tower again, at whatever price, would make the Seanchan vanish.
Survival lost some of its attraction if it was survival on a leash,
and Elaida&rsquo;s would not be much less confining than the
Seanchan&rsquo;s. What it was to <em>be</em> Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to keep Gareth Bryne at
arm&rsquo;s length,&rdquo; Siuan said suddenly. &ldquo;The man&rsquo;s a walking
tribulation, it&rsquo;s true. If he doesn&rsquo;t count as penance
for my lies, being flayed alive wouldn&rsquo;t do. One of these
days, I&rsquo;ll box his ears every morning and twice at evenings,
on general principle, but you can tell him everything. It would
help, if he understood. He&rsquo;s taking you on trust, and it ties
his stomach in knots, wondering whether you know what you&rsquo;re
doing. He doesn&rsquo;t let on, but I see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, pieces clicked in Egwene&rsquo;s mind like a
blacksmith&rsquo;s puzzle coming undone. Shocking pieces. Siuan was
in <em>love</em> with the man! Nothing else made sense. Everything she knew
between them altered. Not necessarily for the better. A woman in
love often put her brains on the shelf when she was around the man
in question. As she herself was all too well aware. Where <em>was</em>
Gawyn? Was he well? Was he warm? Enough of that. Too much, in light
of what she had to say. She put on her best Amyrlin&rsquo;s voice,
sure and in command. &ldquo;You can box Lord Bryne&rsquo;s ears or bed
him, Siuan, but you <em>will</em> watch yourself with him. You will
<em>not</em> let slip things he mustn&rsquo;t know yet. Do you understand
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Siuan jerked stiffly erect. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in the
habit of letting my tongue flap like a torn sail, Mother,&rdquo; she said
heatedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad to hear it, Siuan.&rdquo; Despite their
looking only a few years apart, Siuan was old enough to be her
mother, yet at that moment Egwene felt as though their ages had been
reversed. This might be the first time that Siuan had ever had to
manage with a man not as Aes Sedai, but as a woman. <em>A few years
of thinking I loved Rand</em>, Egwene thought wryly, <em>a few
months of dangling by my toes for Gawyn, and I know all there is to
know</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re done here,&rdquo; she went on, slipping
an arm through Siuan&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Almost. Come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The walls of the tent had seemed little protection,
yet stepping outside brought a renewed assault by winter&rsquo;s
teeth. The moonlight was almost bright enough to read by, reflected
off the snow, but that glow seemed cold. Bryne had vanished as if
he had never been. Leane appeared long enough to say she had seen
no one, her slimness swallowed in layers of wool, then hurried off
into the night looking about her. No one knew of any connection
between Leane and Egwene, and everyone thought Leane and Siuan were
practically at daggers&rsquo; points.</p>

<p>Gathering her cloak as best she could one-handed,
Egwene focused on ignoring the icy chill as she and Siuan walked in
the opposite direction from Leane. Ignoring the chill, and keeping
an eye out for anyone who happened to be out. Not that anyone who
was outside now was likely to be there by happenstance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord Bryne was right,&rdquo; she told Siuan, &ldquo;about it
being better if Pelivar and Arathelle believed those stories. Or at
least if they were uncertain. Too uncertain to fight, or do
anything except talk. Do you think they would welcome a visit from
Aes Sedai? Siuan, are you listening to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Siuan gave a start, and stopped staring into the
distance ahead of them. She had been walking ahead without missing
a step, but now she slipped and nearly sat down in the frozen path,
barely regaining her balance in time to keep from pulling Egwene
down. &ldquo;Yes, Mother. Of course I&rsquo;m listening. They might not be
exactly welcoming, but I doubt they&rsquo;ll turn sisters away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I want you to wake Beonin, Anaiya, and Myrelle.
They are to ride north inside the hour. If Lord Bryne expects a
reply as soon as tomorrow evening, time is short.&rdquo; A pity she had
not found out exactly where this other army was located, but asking
Bryne might have roused suspicion. Finding it should not be too
hard for Warders, and those three sisters had five between
them.</p>

<p>Siuan listened in silence to her instructions. Not
only those three were to be rooted out of their sleep. Come dawn,
Sheriam and Carlinya, Morvrin and Nisao would all know what to say
over breakfast. Seeds had to be planted, seeds that could not have
been placed earlier for fear of them sprouting too soon, but now
they had all too little time to grow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be a pleasure to haul them out of their
blankets,&rdquo; Siuan said when she was done. &ldquo;If I have to tramp around
in this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Releasing Egwene&rsquo;s arm, she started to turn
away, then stopped, her face serious, even grim. &ldquo;I know you want
to be a second Gerra Kishar&mdash;or maybe Sereille Bagand. You
have it in you to match either. But be careful you don&rsquo;t turn
out to be another Shein Chunla. Good night, Mother. Sleep well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene stood watching her go, a cloak-shrouded figure
sometimes skidding on the path and muttering angrily almost loud
enough to make out. Gerra and Sereille were remembered as among the
greatest Amyrlins. Both had raised the influence and prestige of
the White Tower to levels seldom equaled since before Artur
Hawkwing. Both controlled the Tower itself, too, Gerra by
skillfully playing one faction in the Hall against another,
Sereille by the sheer force of her will. Shein Chunla was another
matter, one who had squandered the power of the Amyrlin Seat,
alienating most of the sisters in the Tower. The world believed
that Shein had died in office, close on four hundred years ago, but
the deeply hidden truth was that she had been deposed and sent into
exile for life. Even the secret histories treaded lightly in
certain areas, yet it was fairly obvious that, after the fourth
plot to restore her to the Amyrlin Seat was uncovered, the sisters
guarding Shein had smothered her in her sleep with a pillow. Egwene
shivered, and told herself it was the cold.</p>

<p>Turning, she began making her slow way back to her
tent alone. Sleep well? The fat moon hung low in the sky, and there
were hours yet till sunrise, but she was not sure she was going to
be able to sleep at all.</p>
