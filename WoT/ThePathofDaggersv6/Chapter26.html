<h4><em>The Extra Bit</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">S</span>eaine
strode the hallways of the Tower with a
growing sense of being confounded at every turn. The White Tower
was quite large, true, but she had been at this for hours. She very
much wanted to be snug in her own rooms. Despite casements in place
in every window, drafts drifted along the broad, tapestry-hung
corridors and made the stand-lamps flicker. Cold drafts, and
difficult to ignore when they slipped under her skirts. Her rooms
were warm and comfortable, and safe.</p>

<p>Maids bobbed curtsies and manservants bowed in her
wake, half-seen and completely ignored. Most sisters were in their
own Ajahs&rsquo; quarters, and those few out and about moved with
wary pride, often in pairs, always of the same Ajah, shawls spread
along their arms and displayed like banners. She smiled and nodded
pleasantly to Talene, but the statuesque, golden-haired Sitter
returned a hard stare, beauty carved from ice, then stalked away
twitching her green-fringed shawl.</p>

<p>Too late now to approach Talene about being part of
the search, even had Pevara been agreeable. Pevara counseled
caution, then more caution, and truth to tell, Seaine was more than
willing to listen under the circumstances. It was just that Talene
was a friend. Had been a friend.</p>

<p>Talene was not the worst. Several ordinary sisters
sniffed at her openly. At a Sitter! None White, of course, but that
should have made no difference. No matter what was going on in the
Tower, proprieties should be observed. Juilaine Madome, a tall,
attractive woman with short-cut black hair who had held a chair for
the Brown less than a year, brushed past her without so much as a
murmur of apology and went off with those mannish strides of hers.
Saerin Asnobar, another Brown Sitter, gave Seaine a fierce scowl
and fingered that curved knife she always carried behind her belt
before disappearing down a side corridor. Saerin was Altaran,
slight touches of white at her dark temples emphasizing a thin
age-faded white scar across one olive cheek, and only a Warder
could match her for scowling.</p>

<p>Perhaps these things were all to be expected. There
had been several unfortunate incidents recently, and no sister
would forget being bundled unceremoniously from the hallways around
another Ajah&rsquo;s quarters, much less what had sometimes gone
with it. Rumor said a Sitter&mdash;a Sitter!&mdash;had
had more than her dignity ruffled by the Reds, though not who. A
great pity the Hall could not obstruct Elaida&rsquo;s mad decree,
but first one Ajah, then another, had leaped on the new
prerogatives, few Sitters were willing to think of giving them up
now they were in place, and the result was a Tower divided very
nearly into armed camps. Once Seaine had thought the air in the
Tower felt like a quivering hot jelly of suspicion and backbiting;
now it was quivering hot jelly with an acid bite.</p>

<p>Clicking her tongue in vexation, she adjusted her own
white-fringed shawl as Saerin vanished. It was illogical to flinch
because an Altaran scowled&mdash;even Saerin would go no further;
surely not&mdash;and more than illogical to worry over what she
could not change when she had a task.</p>

<p>And then, after all of her search that morning, she
took a single step and saw her long-sought quarry walking toward
her. Zerah Dacan was a slim, black-haired girl with a prideful air,
properly self-possessed, and by all outward evidence untouched by
the heated currents flowing through the Tower these days. Well, not
a girl precisely, but Seaine was sure she had not worn that
white-fringed shawl fifty years yet. She was inexperienced.
Relatively inexperienced. That might help.</p>

<p>Zerah made no move to avoid a Sitter of her own Ajah,
bowing her head in respect as Seaine fell in beside her. Quite a
lot of intricate golden embroidery climbed the sleeves of her snowy
dress and made a wide band at the bottom of her skirt. It was an
unusual degree of show for the White Ajah. &ldquo;Sitter,&rdquo; she murmured.
Did her blue eyes hold a touch of worry?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I need you for something,&rdquo; Seaine said more calmly
than she felt. Very likely she was transplanting her own feelings
into Zerah&rsquo;s big eyes. &ldquo;Come with me.&rdquo; There was nothing to
fear, not in the heart of the White Tower, but keeping her hands
folded at her waist, unclenched, required surprising effort.</p>

<p>As expected&mdash;as hoped&mdash;Zerah went along
with only another murmur, this of acquiescence. She glided at
Seaine&rsquo;s side quite gracefully as they descended broad marble
staircases and wide curving ramps, and gave only the slightest
frown when Seaine opened a door on the ground floor, onto narrow
stairs that spiraled down into darkness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After you, sister,&rdquo; Seaine said, channeling a small
ball of light. By protocol, she should have preceded the other
woman, but she could not bring herself to do that.</p>

<p>Zerah did not hesitate in going down. Logically, she
had nothing to fear from a Sitter, a White Sitter. Logically,
Seaine would tell her what she wanted when the time was ripe, and
it would be nothing she could not do. Illogically, Seaine&rsquo;s
stomach fluttered like a huge moth. Light, she held <em>saidar</em>
and the other woman did not. Zerah was weaker in any case. There
was nothing to fear. Which did nothing to quiet those fluttering
wings in her middle.</p>

<p>Down they climbed and down, past doors letting onto
basements and sub-basements, until they reached the very lowest
level, below even where the Accepted were tested. The dark hallway
was lit only by Seaine&rsquo;s small light. They held their skirts
high, but their slippers kicked up small clouds of dust however
carefully they stepped. Plain wooden doors lined the smooth stone
walls, many with great lumps of rust for hinges and locks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sitter,&rdquo; Zerah asked, finally showing doubt,
&ldquo;whatever can we be after down here? I don&rsquo;t believe anyone
has been this deep for years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seaine was sure her own visit, a few days earlier,
had been the first to this level in at least a century. That was
one of the reasons she and Pevara had chosen it. &ldquo;Just in here,&rdquo;
she said, swinging open a door that moved with only a little
squealing. No amount of oil could loosen all the rust, and efforts
to use the Power had been useless. Her abilities with Earth were
better than Pevara&rsquo;s, but that was not saying very much.</p>

<p>Zerah stepped in, and blinked in surprise. In an
otherwise empty room, Pevara sat behind a sturdy if rather worn
table with three small benches around it. Getting those few pieces
down unseen had been difficult&mdash;especially when servants
could not be trusted. Clearing out the dust had been much simpler
if no more pleasant, and smoothing the dust in the hall outside,
necessary after every visit, had been simply onerous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was about to give up sitting here in the dark,&rdquo;
Pevara growled. The glow of <em>saidar</em> surrounded her as she
lifted a lantern from beneath the table and channeled it alight,
casting as much illumination as the rough-walled former storeroom
deserved. Somewhat plump and normally pretty, the Red Sitter looked
a bear with two sore teeth. &ldquo;We want to ask you a few questions,
Zerah.&rdquo; And she shielded the woman as Seaine shut the door.</p>

<p>Zerah&rsquo;s shadowed face remained utterly calm, but
she swallowed audibly. &ldquo;About what, Sitters?&rdquo; There was the
faintest tremor in the younger woman&rsquo;s voice, as well. It
could be simply the mood of the Tower, though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Black Ajah,&rdquo; Pevara replied curtly. &ldquo;We want to
know whether you&rsquo;re a Darkfriend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amazement and outrage shattered Zerah&rsquo;s calm.
Most would have taken that for sufficient denial without her
snapped &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to take that from you! You Reds have
been setting up false Dragons for years! If you ask me,
there&rsquo;s no need to look further than the Red quarters to find
Black sisters!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pevara&rsquo;s face darkened with fury. Her loyalty to
her Ajah was strong, which went without saying, but worse, she had
lost her entire family to Darkfriends. Seaine decided to step in
before Pevara resorted to brute force. They had no proof. Not
yet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit, Zerah,&rdquo; she said with as much warmth as she
could muster. &ldquo;Sit down, sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zerah turned toward the door as though she might
disobey an order from a Sitter&mdash;and of her own Ajah!&mdash;but at last she settled onto one of the benches, stiffly, sitting
right at the edge.</p>

<p>Before Seaine had finished taking a seat that placed
Zerah between them, Pevara laid the ivory-white Oath Rod on the
battered tabletop. Seaine sighed. They were Sitters, with a perfect
right to use any <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> they wished, but she had
been the one to filch it&mdash;she could not help thinking of it
as filching when she had observed none of the proper procedures&mdash;and the whole time, in the back of her head, she had been
sure she would turn to find long-dead Sereille Bagand standing
here, ready to haul her off to the Mistress of Novices&rsquo; study
by her ear. Irrational, but no less real.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We want to make sure you tell the truth,&rdquo; Pevara
said, still sounding like an angry bear, &ldquo;so you will swear an oath
on this, and then I&rsquo;ll ask again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should not be subjected to this,&rdquo; Zerah said with
an accusing look at Seaine, &ldquo;but I will re-swear all of the Oaths,
if that&rsquo;s what it needs to satisfy you. And I will demand an
apology from you <em>both</em>, afterward.&rdquo; She hardly sounded like
a women shielded and asked such a question. Almost contemptuously,
she reached for the slim, foot-long rod. It shone in the dim light
of the lantern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll swear to obey the two of us absolutely,&rdquo;
Pevara told her, and that hand snatched back as if from a coiled
viper. Pevara went right on, even sliding the Rod closer to the
woman with two fingers. &ldquo;That way, we can tell you to answer
truthfully and know you will, and if you give the wrong answer, we
can know you&rsquo;ll be obedient and helpful in helping us hunt
down your Black sisters. The Rod can be used to free you of the
oath, if you give the right answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To <em>free</em>&mdash;?&rdquo; Zerah exclaimed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard of anyone being <em>loosed</em> from an oath
on the Oath Rod.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is why we are taking all these precautions,&rdquo;
Seaine told her. &ldquo;Logically, a Black sister must be able to lie,
which means she must have been freed of at least that Oath and likely
all three. Pevara and I tested, and found the procedure much the
same as taking an oath.&rdquo; She did not mention how painful it had
been, though, leaving the pair of them weeping. She also did not
mention that Zerah would not be freed of her oath whatever her
answer, not until the search for the Black Ajah came to a
conclusion. For one thing, she could not be allowed to run off and
complain about this questioning, which she most certainly would,
with every right, if she was not of the Black. If.</p>

<p>Light, but Seaine wished they had found a sister from
another Ajah who fit the criteria they had set. A Green or a Yellow
would have done quite nicely. That lot were overweening at the best
of times, and of late&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;! No. She was not going to fall prey to
the sickness spreading through the Tower. Yet she could not help
the names that flashed through her head, a dozen Greens, twice as
many Yellows, and every one long past due taking down a few rungs.
Sniff at a Sitter?</p>

<p>&ldquo;You <em>freed</em> yourselves from one of
the Oaths?&rdquo; Zerah sounded startled, disgusted, uneasy, all at the
same time. Perfectly reasonable responses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And took it again,&rdquo; Pevara muttered impatiently.
Snatching up the slim rod, she channeled a little Spirit into one
end while maintaining Zerah&rsquo;s shield. &ldquo;Under the Light, I vow
to speak no word that is not true. Under the Light, I vow to make
no weapon for one man to kill another. Under the Light, I vow not
to use the One Power as a weapon except against Shadowspawn, or in
the last defense of my life, the life of my Warder, or that of
another sister.&rdquo; She did not grimace over the part about Warders;
new sisters bound for the Red often did. &ldquo;I am not a Darkfriend. I
hope that satisfies you.&rdquo; She showed Zerah her teeth, but whether
in smile or snarl was hard to say.</p>

<p>Seaine retook the Oaths in turn, each producing a
slight momentary pressure everywhere from her scalp to the soles of
her feet. In truth, the pressure was difficult to detect at all,
with her skin still feeling too tight from retaking the Oath
against speaking a lie. Claiming that Pevara had a beard or that
the streets of Tar Valon were paved with cheese had been strangely
exhilarating for a time&mdash;even Pevara had giggled&mdash;but
hardly worth the discomfort now. Testing had not really seemed
necessary, to her. Logically, it must be so. Saying that she was
not of the Black twisted her tongue&mdash;a vile thing to be
forced to deny&mdash;but she handed Zerah the Oath Rod with a
decisive nod.</p>

<p>Shifting on her bench, the slender woman turned the
smooth white rod in her fingers, swallowing convulsively. The pale
lantern light made her appear ill. She looked from one of them to
the other, wide-eyed, then her hands tightened on the Rod, and she
nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly as I said,&rdquo; Pevara growled, channeling
Spirit to the Rod again, &ldquo;or you&rsquo;ll be swearing until you have
it right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I vow to obey the two of you absolutely,&rdquo; Zerah said
in a tight voice, then shuddered as the oath took hold. It was
always tighter at the first. &ldquo;Ask me about the Black Ajah,&rdquo; she
demanded. Her hands shook holding the Rod. &ldquo;Ask me about the Black
Ajah!&rdquo; Her intensity told Seaine the answer even before Pevara
released the flow of Spirit and asked the question, commanding
utter truth. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; Zerah practically shouted. &ldquo;No, I am not Black
Ajah! Now take this oath from me! Free me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seaine slumped dejectedly, resting her elbows on the
table. She certainly had not <em>wanted</em> Zerah to answer yes,
but she had been sure they had found the other woman out in a lie.
One lie found, or so it had seemed, after weeks of searching. How
many more weeks of searching lay ahead? And of looking over her
shoulder from waking to sleeping? When she managed to sleep.</p>

<p>Pevara stabbed an accusing finger at the woman. &ldquo;You
told people that you came from the north.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zerah&rsquo;s eyes went wide again. &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; she said
slowly. &ldquo;I rode down the bank of the Erinin to Jualdhe. Now free me
of this oath!&rdquo; She licked her lips.</p>

<p>Seaine frowned at her. &ldquo;Goldenthorn seeds and a red
cockle-burr were found on your saddlecloth, Zerah. Goldenthorn and
red cockleburr can&rsquo;t be found for a hundred miles <em>
south</em> of Tar Valon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zerah leaped to her feet, and Pevara snapped, &ldquo;Sit
down!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman dropped onto the bench with a loud smack,
but she did not even wince. She was trembling. No, shaking. Her
mouth was clamped shut, otherwise Seaine was sure her teeth would
have been chattering. Light, the question of north or south
frightened her more than an accusation of being a Darkfriend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From where did you start out,&rdquo; Seaine asked slowly,
&ldquo;and why&mdash;?&rdquo; She meant to ask why the woman had gone
roundabout&mdash;which plainly she had&mdash;just to hide which
direction she came from, but answers burst from Zerah&rsquo;s
mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From Salidar,&rdquo; she squealed. There was no other word
for it. Still clutching the Oath Rod, she writhed on her bench.
Tears spilled from her eyes, eyes as wide as they would go and
fixed on Pevara. Words poured out, though her teeth truly did
chatter now. &ldquo;I c-came to m-make sure all the sisters here know
about the R-Reds and Logain, so they&rsquo;ll d-depose Elaida and
the T-Tower can be whole again.&rdquo; With a wail she collapsed into
openmouthed bawling as she stared at the Red Sitter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Pevara said. Then again, more grimly, &ldquo;Well!&rdquo;
Her face was all composure, but the glitter in her dark eyes was
far from the mischief Seaine remembered as novice and Accepted. &ldquo;So
you are the source of that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;rumor. You are going to stand
before the Hall and reveal it for the lie it is! Admit the lie,
girl!&rdquo;</p>

<p>If Zerah&rsquo;s eyes had been wide before, they
bulged now. The Rod dropped from her hands to roll across the
tabletop, and she clutched her throat. A choking sound came from
her suddenly gaping mouth. Pevara stared at her in shock, but
suddenly Seaine understood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light&rsquo;s mercy,&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;You do not have
to lie, Zerah.&rdquo; Zerah&rsquo;s legs thrashed beneath the table as if
she were trying to rise and could not get her feet under her. &ldquo;Tell
her, Pevara. She believes it&rsquo;s true! You&rsquo;ve commanded her
to speak the truth <em>and</em> to lie. Don&rsquo;t look at me that
way! She believes!&rdquo; A bluish tinge appeared on Zerah&rsquo;s lips.
Her eyelids fluttered. Seaine gathered calm with both hands.
&ldquo;Pevara, you gave the order so apparently you must release her, or
she will suffocate right in front of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a <em>rebel</em>.&rdquo; Pevara&rsquo;s mutter
invested that word with all the scorn it could hold. But then she
sighed. &ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t been tried, yet. You don&rsquo;t have to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;lie&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;girl.&rdquo; Zerah toppled forward and lay with her cheek
pressed against the tabletop, gulping air between whimpers.</p>

<p>Seaine shook her head in wonder. They had not
considered the possibility of <em>conflicting</em> oaths. What if
the Black Ajah did not merely remove the Oath against lying, but
replaced it with one of their own? What if they replaced all Three
with their own oaths? She and Pevara would need to go very
carefully if they did find a Black sister, or they might have her
fall dead before they knew what the conflict was. Perhaps first a
renunciation of <em>all</em> oaths&mdash;no way to go about it
more carefully without knowing what Black sisters swore&mdash;followed by retaking the Three? Light, the pain of being loosed
from everything at once would be little short of being put to the
question. Maybe not short of it at all. But certainly a Darkfriend
deserved that and more. If they ever found one.</p>

<p>Pevara glared down at the gasping woman without the
slightest touch of pity on her face. &ldquo;When she stands trial for
rebellion, I intend to sit on her court.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When she <em>is</em> tried, Pevara,&rdquo; Seaine said
thoughtfully. &ldquo;A pity to lose the assistance of one we know
isn&rsquo;t a Darkfriend. And since she <em>is</em> a rebel, we need
not be overly concerned about using her.&rdquo; There had been a number
of discussions, none to a conclusion, about the second reason for
leaving the new oath in place. A sister sworn to obey could be
compelled&mdash;Seaine shifted uneasily; that sounded entirely too
close to the forbidden vileness of Compulsion&mdash;she could be
<em>induced</em> to help in the hunt, so long as you did not mind
forcing her to accept the danger, whether she wished to or not. &ldquo;I
cannot think they would send only one,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;Zerah, how
many of you came to spread this tale?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten,&rdquo; the woman mumbled against the tabletop, then
jerked erect, glaring in defiance. &ldquo;I will not betray my sisters! I
won&rsquo;t&mdash;!&rdquo; Abruptly she cut off, lips twisting
bitterly as she realized she had done just that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Names!&rdquo; Pevara barked. &ldquo;Give me their names, or I
will have your hide here and now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Names spilled from Zerah&rsquo;s unwilling lips. At
the command, certainly, more than the threat. Looking at
Pevara&rsquo;s grim face, though, Seaine was sure she needed little
provocation to stripe Zerah like a novice caught stealing.
Strangely, she herself did not feel the same animosity. Revulsion,
yes, but clearly not as strong. The woman was a rebel who had
helped break the White Tower when a sister must accept anything to
keep the Tower whole, and yet&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Very strange.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You agree, Pevara?&rdquo; she said when the list
concluded. The stubborn woman gave her only a fierce nod for
agreement. &ldquo;Very well. Zerah, you will bring Bernaile to my rooms
this afternoon.&rdquo; There were two from each Ajah excepting the Blue
and the Red, it seemed, but best to begin with the other White.
&ldquo;You will say only that I wish to speak to her on a private matter.
You will give her no warning by word, deed, or omission. Then you
will stand quietly and let Pevara and me do what is necessary. You
are being recruited into a worthier cause than your misguided
rebellion, Zerah.&rdquo; Of course it was misguided. No matter how mad
with power Elaida had become. &ldquo;You are going to help us hunt down
the Black Ajah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zerah&rsquo;s head jerked unwilling nods at each
injunction, her face pained, but at mention of a hunt for the Black
Ajah, she gasped. Light, her wits must have been totally unhinged
by her experiences not to see that!</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you will stop spreading these&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;stories,&rdquo;
Pevara put in sternly. &ldquo;From this moment, you&rsquo;ll not mention
the Red Ajah and false Dragons together. Am I understood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zerah&rsquo;s face donned a mask of sullen
stubbornness. Zerah&rsquo;s mouth said, &ldquo;I understand, Sitter.&rdquo; She
looked ready to begin weeping again from sheer frustration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then get out of my sight,&rdquo; Pevara told her,
releasing the shield and <em>saidar</em> together. &ldquo;And compose
yourself! Wash your face and straighten your hair!&rdquo; That last was
directed at the back of the woman already darting from the table.
Zerah had to pull her hands away from her hair to open the door. As
the door squeaked shut behind her, Pevara snorted. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
put it past her to have gone to this Bernaile like a sloven, hoping
to warn her that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A valid point,&rdquo; Seaine admitted. &ldquo;But who will we
warn if we scowl right and left at these women? At the very least,
we will attract notice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The way matters are, Seaine, we wouldn&rsquo;t
attract notice kicking them across the Tower grounds.&rdquo; Pevara
sounded as if that were an attractive notion. &ldquo;They are <em>
rebels</em>, and I intend to hold them so hard they squeak if one
of them so much as has a wrong thought!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went round and round about that. Seaine insisted
that care in the orders they gave, leaving no loopholes, would be
sufficient. Pevara pointed out that they were letting ten rebels&mdash;ten!&mdash;walk the Tower&rsquo;s halls unpunished. Seaine
said they <em>would</em> face punishment eventually, and Pevara
growled that eventually was not soon enough. Seaine had always
admired the other woman&rsquo;s strength of will, but really,
sometimes it was pure stubbornness.</p>

<p>A faint creak from a hinge was all the warning Seaine
had to snatch the Oath Rod into her lap, hiding it in folds of her
skirt as the door opened wide. She and Pevara embraced the Source
almost as one.</p>

<p>Saerin walked into the room calmly, holding a
lantern, and stood aside for Talene, who was followed by tiny
Yukiri, with a second light, and boyishly slim Doesine, tall for a
Cairhienin, who closed the door quite firmly and settled her back
against it as if to keep anyone from leaving. Four Sitters,
representing all the remaining Ajahs in the Tower. They seemed to
ignore the fact that Seaine and Pevara held <em>saidar</em>.
Suddenly, to Seaine, the room felt rather crowded. Imagination, and
irrational, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strange to see the pair of you together,&rdquo; Saerin
said. Her face might be serene, but she slid fingers along the hilt
of that curved knife behind her belt. She had held her chair forty
years, longer than anyone else in the Hall, and everyone had
learned to be careful of her temper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We might say the same of you,&rdquo; Pevara replied dryly.
Saerin&rsquo;s temper never upset <em>her</em>. &ldquo;Or did you come
down here to help Doesine try to get some of her own back?&rdquo; A
sudden flush made the Yellow&rsquo;s face look even more that of a
pretty boy despite her elegant bearing, and told Seaine which
Sitter had strayed too near the Red quarters with unfortunate
results. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have thought that would bring you
together, though. Greens at Yellows&rsquo; throats, Browns at
Grays&rsquo;. Or did you just bring them down for a quiet duel,
Saerin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frantically, Seaine cast around for what reason <em>
would</em> have these four this deep into the bedrock of Tar Valon.
What could tie them together? Their Ajahs&mdash;<em>all</em> of
the Ajahs&mdash;truly were at one another&rsquo;s throats. All four
had been handed penances by Elaida. No Sitter could enjoy Labor,
especially when everyone knew exactly why she was scrubbing floors
or pots, yet that was hardly a bond. What else? None were nobly
born. Saerin and Yukiri were the daughters of innkeepers, Talene of
farmers, while Doesine&rsquo;s father had been a cutler. Saerin had
been trained first by the Daughters of Silence, the only one of
that lot to reach the shawl. Absolutely useless drivel. Suddenly,
something did strike her, and dried her throat. Saerin with her
temper often barely in rein. Doesine, who had actually run away
three times as a novice, though she had only once made it as far as
the bridges. Talene, who might have earned more punishments than
any other novice in the history of the Tower. Yukiri, always the
last Gray to join her sisters&rsquo; consensus when she wanted to go
another way, the last to join the Hall&rsquo;s, for that matter. All
four were considered rebels, in a way, and Elaida had humiliated
every one. Could they be thinking they had made a mistake, standing
to depose Siuan and raise Elaida? Could <em>they</em> have found
about Zerah and the others? And if so, what did they intend to
do?</p>

<p>Mentally, Seaine prepared herself to weave <em>
saidar</em>, though without much hope that she could escape. Pevara
matched Saerin and Yukiri in strength, but she herself was weaker
than any here save Doesine. She prepared herself, and Talene
stepped forward and burst all of her logical deductions to
flinders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yukiri noticed you two sneaking about together, and
we want to know why.&rdquo; Her surprisingly deep voice held heat despite
the ice that seemed to coat her face. &ldquo;Did the heads of your Ajahs
set you a secret task? In public, the Ajahs&rsquo; heads snarl at
one another worse than anyone else, but they&rsquo;ve been sneaking
off into corners to talk, it seems. Whatever they&rsquo;re scheming,
the Hall has a right to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, do give over, Talene.&rdquo; Yukiri&rsquo;s voice was
always an even bigger surprise than Talene&rsquo;s. The woman looked
a miniature queen, in dark silver silk with ivory lace, but she
sounded a comfortable country woman. She claimed the contrast
helped in negotiations. She smiled at Seaine and Pevara, a monarch
perhaps unsure how gracious she should be. &ldquo;I saw the pair of you
sniffing about like ferrets at the hencoop,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I held
my tongue&mdash;you might be pillow friends, for all I know, and
whose business is that but yours?&mdash;I held my tongue till
Talene here started yelping about who&rsquo;s been huddling in
corners. I&rsquo;ve seen a bit of huddling in corners myself, and I
suspect some of those women might head their Ajahs as well, so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Sometimes six and six make a dozen, and sometimes they make a
mess. Tell us if you can, now. The Hall does have a right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are not leaving until you do tell,&rdquo; Talene put in
even more heatedly than before.</p>

<p>Pevara snorted and folded her arms. &ldquo;If the head of
my Ajah spoke two words to me, I&rsquo;d see no reason to tell you
what they were. As it happens, what Seaine and I were discussing
has nothing to do with the Red or the White. Snoop elsewhere.&rdquo; But
she did not release <em>saidar</em>. Neither did Seaine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bloody useless and I bloody knew it,&rdquo; Doesine
muttered from her place by the door. &ldquo;Why I ever flaming let you
talk me into this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Just as bloody well nobody else knows, or
we&rsquo;d have sheepswallop all over faces for the whole bloody
Tower to see.&rdquo; At times she had a tongue like a boy, too, a boy who
needed his mouth washed out.</p>

<p>Seaine would have stood to leave if she had not
feared her knees would betray her. Pevara did stand, and raised an
impatient eyebrow at the women between her and the door.</p>

<p>Saerin fingered her knife hilt and eyed them
quizzically, not shifting a step. &ldquo;A puzzle,&rdquo; she murmured.
Suddenly she glided forward, her free hand dipping into
Seaine&rsquo;s lap so quickly that Seaine gasped. She tried to keep
the Oath Road hidden, but the only result was that she ended with
Saerin holding the Rod waist high with one hand while she held the
other end and a fistful of her skirts. &ldquo;I enjoy puzzles,&rdquo; Saerin
said.</p>

<p>Seaine let go and adjusted her dress; there seemed
nothing else to do.</p>

<p>The appearance of the Rod produced a momentary babble
as nearly everyone spoke at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blood and fire,&rdquo; Doesine growled. &ldquo;Are you down here
raising new bloody sisters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, leave it with them, Saerin,&rdquo; Yukiri laughed
right on top of her. &ldquo;Whatever they&rsquo;re up to, it&rsquo;s their
own business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Atop both, Talene barked, &ldquo;Why else are they sneaking
about&mdash;together!&mdash;if it isn&rsquo;t to do with the Ajah
heads?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Saerin waved a hand, and after a moment gained quiet.
All present were Sitters, but she had the right to speak first in
the Hall, and her forty years counted for something, too. &ldquo;This is
the key to the puzzle, I think,&rdquo; she said, stroking the Rod with
her thumb. &ldquo;Why this, after all?&rdquo; Abruptly the glow of <em>
saidar</em> surrounded her, too, and she channeled Spirit to the
Rod. &ldquo;Under the Light, I will speak no word that is not true. I am
not a Darkfriend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the silence that followed, a mouse sneezing would
have sounded loud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I right?&rdquo; Saerin said, releasing the Power. She
held the Rod out toward Seaine.</p>

<p>For the third time, Seaine retook the Oath against
lying, and for the second time repeated that she was not of the
Black. Pevara did the same with frozen dignity. And eyes sharp as
an eagle&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is ridiculous,&rdquo; Talene said. &ldquo;There <em>is</em>
no Black Ajah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yukiri took the Rod from Pevara and channeled. &ldquo;Under
the Light, I will speak no word that is not true. I am not Black
Ajah.&rdquo; The light of <em>saidar</em> around her winked out, and she
handed the Rod to Doesine.</p>

<p>Talene frowned in disgust. &ldquo;Stand aside, Doesine. I
for one will not put up with this filthy suggestion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Under the Light, I will speak no word that is not
true,&rdquo; Doesine said almost reverently, the glow around her like a
halo. &ldquo;I am not of the Black Ajah.&rdquo; When matters were serious, her
tongue was as clean as any Mistress of Novices could have wished.
She extended the Rod to Talene.</p>

<p>The golden-haired woman started back as from a
poisonous snake. &ldquo;Even to ask this is a slander. Worse than
slander!&rdquo; Something feral moved in her eyes. An irrational thought,
perhaps, but that was what Seaine saw. &ldquo;Now move out of my way,&rdquo;
Talene demanded with all the authority of a Sitter in her voice. &ldquo;I
am leaving!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; Pevara said quietly, and Yukiri nodded
slowly in agreement. Saerin did not stroke her knife hilt; she
gripped it till her knuckles went white.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Riding through the deep snows of Andor, floundering
through them, Toveine Gazal cursed the day she was born. Short and
slightly plump, with smooth copper skin and long glossy dark hair,
she had seemed pretty to many over the years, but none had ever
called her beautiful. Certainly none would now. The dark eyes that
had once been direct now bored into whatever she looked at. That
was when she was not angry. She was angry today. When Toveine was
angry, serpents fled.</p>

<p>Four other Reds rode&mdash;floundered&mdash;at her
back, and behind them twenty of the Tower Guard in dark coats and
cloaks. None of the men liked it that their armor was stowed away
on the packhorses, and they watched the forest lining both sides of
the road as though expecting attack any moment. How they thought to
cross three hundred miles of Andor unnoticed, wearing coats and
cloaks with the Flame of Tar Valon shining bright on them, Toveine
could not imagine. The journey was almost done, though. In another
day, perhaps two with roads knee-deep in snow on the horses, she
would join with nine other parties exactly like hers. Not all of
the sisters in them were Red, unfortunately, but that did not
trouble her overmuch. Toveine Gazal, once a Sitter for the Red,
would go into the histories as the woman who destroyed this <em>
Black</em> Tower.</p>

<p>She was sure Elaida thought her grateful for the
chance, called back from exile and disgrace, given the opportunity
for redemption. She sneered, and if a wolf had been looking into
the deep hood of her cloak, it might have quailed. What had been
done twenty years ago was necessary, and the Light burn all those
who muttered that the Black Ajah must have been involved. It had
been necessary and right, but Toveine Gazal had been driven from
her chair in the Hall, and forced to howl for mercy under the
birch, with the assembled sisters watching, and even novices and
Accepted witnessing that Sitters, too, lay beneath the law, though
they were not told what law. And then she had been sent to work
these last twenty years on the isolated Black Hills farm of
Mistress Jara Doweel, a woman who considered an Aes Sedai serving
penance in exile no different from any other hand laboring in sun
and snow. Toveine&rsquo;s hands shifted on her reins; she could feel
the calluses. Mistress Doweel&mdash;even now, she could not think
of the woman without the honorific she had demanded&mdash;Mistress
Doweel believed in hard work. And discipline as tight as any novice
faced! She had no mercy on anyone who tried to shirk the
backbreaking labor that she herself shared, and less than none for
a woman who sneaked away to comfort herself with a pretty boy. That
had been Toveine&rsquo;s life these past twenty years. And Elaida
had slipped through the cracks uncaught, danced her way to the
Amyrlin Seat that Toveine had once dreamed of for herself. No, she
was not grateful. But she had learned to wait her chance.</p>

<p>Abruptly, a tall man in a black coat, dark hair
falling to his shoulders, spurred his horse out of the forest into
the road ahead of her, spraying snow. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no point
struggling,&rdquo; he announced firmly, raising a gloved hand. &ldquo;Surrender
peacefully, and no one will be hurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was neither his appearance nor his words that made
Toveine rein up short, letting the other sisters gather beside her.
&ldquo;Take him,&rdquo; she said calmly. &ldquo;You had better link. He has me
shielded.&rdquo; It seemed one of these Asha&rsquo;man had come to her.
How convenient of him.</p>

<p>Abruptly she realized that nothing was happening and
took her eyes from the fellow to frown at Jenare. The woman&rsquo;s
pale, square face seemed absolutely bloodless. &ldquo;Toveine,&rdquo; she said
unsteadily, &ldquo;I also am shielded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am shielded, too,&rdquo; Lemai breathed in disbelief,
and the others chimed in, increasingly frantic. All shielded.</p>

<p>More men in black coats appeared from among the
trees, their horses stepping slowly, all around. Toveine stopped
counting at fifteen. The Guards muttered angrily, waiting on a
sister&rsquo;s command. They knew nothing yet except that a band of
rogues had waylaided them. Toveine clicked her tongue in
irritation. These men could not all channel, of course, but
apparently every Asha&rsquo;man who could do so had come against
her. She did not panic. Unlike some of the sisters with her, these
were not the first men who channeled that she had confronted. The
tall man began riding toward her, smiling, apparently thinking they
had obeyed his ridiculous order.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At my command,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;we will break in
every direction. As soon as you are far enough away that the man
loses the shield,&rdquo; men always thought they had to be able to see to
hold their weaves, which meant that they did have to, &ldquo;turn back
and help the Guards. Ready yourselves.&rdquo; She raised her voice to a
shout. &ldquo;Guardsmen, fight them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roaring, the Guardsmen surged forward, waving their
swords and no doubt thinking to surround and protect the sisters.
Pulling her mare around to the right, Toveine dug in her heels and
crouched low over Sparrow&rsquo;s neck, dodging between startled
Guardsmen, then between two very young men in black coats who gaped
at her in astonishment. Then she was into the trees, urging more
speed, snow spraying wildly, careless of whether the mare broke a
leg. She liked the animal, but more than a horse would die today.
Behind her, shouts. And one voice, roaring through all the
cacophony. The tall man&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take them alive, by order of the Dragon Reborn! Harm
an Aes Sedai, and you&rsquo;ll answer to me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>By order of the Dragon Reborn. For the first time,
Toveine felt fear, an icicle worming into her middle. The Dragon
Reborn. She thrashed Sparrow&rsquo;s neck with the reins. The shield
was still on her! Surely there were enough trees between them
already to block the cursed men&rsquo;s sight of her! Oh, Light, the
Dragon Reborn!</p>

<p>She grunted as something struck her across the
middle, a branch where there was no branch, snatching her out of
the saddle. She hung there watching Sparrow plow off at as much of
a gallop as the snow allowed. She hung there. In the middle of the
air, arms trapped at her sides, feet dangling a pace or more above
the ground. She swallowed. Hard. It had to be the male part of the
Power holding her up. She had never been touched by <em>saidin</em>
before. She could feel the thick band of nothing snug around her
middle. She thought she could feel the Dark One&rsquo;s taint. She
quivered, fighting down screams.</p>

<p>The tall man reined his horse to a halt in front of
her, and she floated down to sit sideways in front of his saddle.
He did not seem particularly interested in the Aes Sedai he had
captured, though. &ldquo;Hardlin!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Norley! Kajima! One of
you bloody young louts come here now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was very tall, with shoulders an axe-handle wide.
That was how Mistress Doweel would have put it. Just short of his
middle years, handsome in a brooding, rugged fashion. Not at all
like the pretty boys Toveine liked, eager and grateful and so
easily controlled. A silver sword decorated the tall collar of his
black wool coat on one side, with a peculiar creature in gold and
red enamel on the other. He was a man who could channel. And he had
her shielded and a prisoner.</p>

<p>The shriek that burst from her throat startled even
her. She would have held it back if she could, but another leaped
out behind it, higher still, and another even higher, another and
another. Kicking wildly, she flung herself from side to side.
Useless against the Power. She knew that, but only in a tiny corner
of her mind. The rest of her howled at the top of her lungs, howled
wordless pleas for rescue from the Shadow. Screaming, she struggled
like a mad beast.</p>

<p>Dimly she was aware of his horse plunging and dancing
as her heels drummed its shoulder. Dimly she heard the man talking.
&ldquo;Easy, you lump-eared sack of coal! Calm down, sister. I&rsquo;m not
going to&mdash;Easy, you spavined mule! Light! My apologies,
sister, but this is how we learn to do it.&rdquo; And then he kissed
her.</p>

<p>She had only a heartbeat to realize his lips were
touching hers, then sight vanished, and warmth flooded through her.
More than warmth. She was melted honey inside, bubbling honey,
rushing toward the boil. She was a harpstring, vibrating faster and
faster, vibrating to invisibility and faster still. She was a thin
crystal vase, quivering on the brink of shattering. The harpstring
broke; the vase shattered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At first, she did not realize that sound had come
from her gaping mouth. For a moment, she could not think
coherently. Panting, she stared up at the male face above her,
wondering who it belonged to. Yes. The tall man. The man who could&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could have done without the extra bit,&rdquo; he sighed,
patting the horse&rsquo;s neck; the animal snorted, but it no longer
leaped about, &ldquo;yet I suppose it is necessary. You&rsquo;re hardly a
wife. Be calm. Don&rsquo;t try to escape, don&rsquo;t attack anyone
in a black coat, and don&rsquo;t touch the Source unless I give you
permission. Now, what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unless he gave permission? The effrontery of the man!
&ldquo;Toveine Gazal,&rdquo; she said, and blinked. Now, why had she answered
him?</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you are,&rdquo; another black-coated man said,
splashing his horse through the snow to them. This one would be
much more to her liking&mdash;if he could not actually channel, at
least. She doubted this pink-cheeked lad shaved more than twice in
the week. &ldquo;Light, Logain!&rdquo; the pretty boy exclaimed. &ldquo;Did you take
a <em>second</em> one? The M&rsquo;Hael won&rsquo;t like that! I
don&rsquo;t think he likes us taking any! Maybe it won&rsquo;t
matter, though, you two being so close and all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Close, Vinchova?&rdquo; Logain said wryly. &ldquo;If the
M&rsquo;Hael had his way, I&rsquo;d be hoeing turnips with the new
boys. Or buried under the field,&rdquo; he added in a mutter she did not
think he meant to be heard.</p>

<p>However much he heard, the pretty boy laughed with
incredulous disbelief. Toveine barely heard him. She was gazing up
at the man looming over her. Logain. The false Dragon. But he was
dead! Stilled and dead! And holding her before his saddle with a
casual hand. Why was she not screaming, or striking at him? Even
her belt knife would do, this near. Yet she had no desire at all to
reach for the ivory haft. She could, she realized. That band around
her middle was gone. She could at least slip down off the horse and
try to&mdash;She had no desire to do that, either.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you do to me?&rdquo; she demanded. Calmly. At
least she had managed to hold on to that!</p>

<p>Turning his horse to ride back to the road, Logain
told her what he had done, and she put her head against that wide
chest, not caring at all how big he was, and wept. She was going to
make Elaida pay for this, she vowed. If Logain ever let her, she
would. That last was an especially bitter thought.</p>
