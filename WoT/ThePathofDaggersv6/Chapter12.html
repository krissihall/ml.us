wished there had been even a simple
transcriber among the things she had removed from Illian after
Sammael&rsquo;s death. This Age was frightful usually, primitive and
uncomfortable. Still, some of it suited her. In a large bamboo cage
at the far end of the room a hundred brightly plumaged birds sang
melodiously, almost as beautiful in their multicolored flitting as
her two pets in transparent robes who waited on either side of the
door, their gazes locked on her, eager to serve her pleasure. If
oil lamps did not give the same light as glowbulbs, aided by large
mirrors on the walls they produced a certain barbaric splendor with
the gilded fish-scale ceiling. It would have been nice to need only
speak the words, but actually putting them on paper with her own
hand produced a pleasure akin to that she felt in sketching. The
script of this Age was quite simple, and learning to duplicate
another&rsquo;s style had been no more difficult.</p>

<p>Signing with a flourish&mdash;not her own name, of
course&mdash;she sanded the thick page, then folded it and sealed
it with one of the signet rings of various sizes that made a
decorative line across the writing table. The Hand and Sword of
Arad Doman impressed on an irregular circle of blue-and-green
wax.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take this to Lord Ituralde with all speed,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;and say only what I told you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As fast as horses can carry me, my Lady.&rdquo; Nazran
bowed as he took the letter, one finger stroking thin black
mustaches above a winning smile. Square and deeply brown in a
well-fitting blue coat, he was handsome; just not sufficiently
handsome. &ldquo;I received this from the Lady Tuva, who died of her
wounds after telling me that she was a courier from Alsalam and had
been attacked by a Gray Man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make sure there is human blood on it,&rdquo; she
admonished. She doubted anyone in this time could tell human blood
from any other, but she had found too many surprises to take an
unnecessary chance. &ldquo;Enough for realism; not enough to spoil what I
wrote.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His black eyes lingered warmly on her as he bowed
again, but as soon as he straightened he hurried to the door, boots
thudding on the pale yellow marble floor. He did not notice the
servants with their eyes fixed ardently on her, or affected not to
notice, though he had once been a friend of the young man. Only a
touch of Compulsion had been needed to make Nazran nearly as avid
to obey as they, not to mention certain that he might yet taste her
charms again. She laughed softly. Well, he believed he had tasted
them; just a little prettier, and he might have. Of course, he
would have been useless for anything else then. He would ride
horses to death reaching Ituralde, and if that message, delivered
by Alsalam&rsquo;s close cousin, supposedly coming from the King
himself and with Gray Men trying to stop it, did not satisfy the
Great Lord&rsquo;s command to increase chaos, nothing would, short
of balefire. And it would serve her own ends very nicely as well.
Her own ends.</p>

<p>Graendal&rsquo;s hand went to the only ring on the
table that was not a signet, a plain golden band too small for any
but her little finger. It had been a pleasant surprise to find an
<em>angreal</em> attuned to women among Sammael&rsquo;s possessions.
A pleasant surprise to have time to find much of anything useful
with al&rsquo;Thor and those puppies who called themselves
Asha&rsquo;man constantly in and out of Sammael&rsquo;s chambers in
the Great Hall of the Council. They had stripped it bare of what
she had not taken. Dangerous puppies, all of them, especially
al&rsquo;Thor. And she had not wanted to risk <em>anyone</em> being
able to draw a line from Sammael to her. Yes, she must increase the
pace of her own plans, and distance herself from Sammael&rsquo;s
disaster.</p>

<p>Abruptly a vertical slash of silver appeared at the
far end of the room, bright against the tapestries hanging between
the heavy gilded mirrors, and a crystalline chime rang aloud. Her
eyebrows rose in surprise. Someone remembered the courtesies of a
more civilized Age, it seemed. Standing, she forced the plain band
of gold down against the ruby ring on her smallest finger and
embraced <em>saidar</em> through it before channeling the web that
would sound an answering chime for whoever wanted to open a
gateway. The <em>angreal</em> did not offer much, yet anyone who
thought they knew her strength would find a shock.</p>

<p>The gateway opened, and two women in nearly identical
red-and-black silk dresses stepped through warily. At least,
Moghedien moved cautiously, dark eyes flickering in search of
traps, hands smoothing her wide skirts; the gateway winked out
after a moment, but she held on to <em>saidar</em>. A sensible
precaution, though Moghedien had always been a great one for
precautions. Graendal did not let go of the Source, either.
Moghedien&rsquo;s companion, a short young woman with long silver
hair and vivid blue eyes, stared about her coldly, hardly more than
glancing in Graendal&rsquo;s direction. By her demeanor, she might
have been a Prime Counselor forced to endure the company of common
laborers and intent on ignoring their existence. A foolish girl, to
imitate the Spider. Red and black did not suit her coloring, and
she should have made better use of such an impressive bosom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Cyndane, Graendal,&rdquo; Moghedien said. &ldquo;We are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;working together.&rdquo; She did not smile when she named the
haughty young woman, but Graendal did. A pretty name for a more
than pretty girl, but what twist of fate had led some mother of
this time to give her daughter a name that meant &ldquo;Last Chance&rdquo;?
Cyndane&rsquo;s face remained cold and smooth, but her eyes flared.
A beautiful doll carved from ice, with hidden fires. It seemed she
knew the meaning and did not like it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What brings you and your friend, Moghedien?&rdquo;
Graendal asked. The Spider was the very last she had expected to
come out from the shadows. &ldquo;Have no fear of speaking in front of my
servants.&rdquo; She gestured, and the pair by the door sank to their
knees, pressed their faces to the floor. They would not quite fall
dead by her simple command, but close.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What interest can you find in them when you destroy
anything that might make them interesting?&rdquo; Cyndane demanded,
striding arrogantly across the floor. She held herself very
straight, striving for every hair of height. &ldquo;Do you know that
Sammael is dead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Graendal kept her own face smooth, with a little
effort. She had supposed this girl some Friend of the Dark whom
Moghedien had picked up to run errands, perhaps a noble who thought
her title counted, but now that she was close&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The girl was
stronger in the One Power than she herself! Even in her own Age,
that had been uncommon among men, and very rare indeed among women.
On the instant, on instinct, she changed her intention to deny any
contact with Sammael.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suspected,&rdquo; she replied, directing a false smile
over the young woman&rsquo;s head at Moghedien. How much did she
know? Where had the Spider found a girl so much stronger than she,
and why was she traveling with her? Moghedien had always been
jealous of anyone with more strength. Or more of anything. &ldquo;He used
to visit me, importuning my help in one mad plan or another. I
never rejected him outright; you know Sammael is&mdash;was&mdash;a
dangerous man to reject. He appeared every few days without fail,
and when he stopped, I assumed something dire had happened to him.
Who is this girl, Moghedien? A remarkable find.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young woman stepped closer, staring up at her
with eyes like blue fire. &ldquo;She told you my name. That is all you
need know.&rdquo; The girl knew she spoke to one of the Chosen, and yet
her tone remained frost. Even given her strength, this was no
simple Friend of the Dark. Unless she was insane. &ldquo;Have you paid
attention to the weather, Graendal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly, Graendal realized that Moghedien was
letting the girl do all the talking. Hanging back until a weakness
became apparent. And Graendal had been letting her! &ldquo;I do not
suppose you came to tell me of Sammael&rsquo;s death, Moghedien,&rdquo;
she said sharply. &ldquo;Or to talk about weather. You know I seldom go
outside.&rdquo; Nature was unruly, lacking order. There were not even
windows in this room, nor in most that she used. &ldquo;What do you
want?&rdquo; The dark-haired woman was edging sideways along the wall;
the glow of the One Power still surrounded her. Graendal stepped
casually so that both remained in her sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You make a mistake, Graendal.&rdquo; A chilly smile barely
curved Cyndane&rsquo;s full lips; she was enjoying this. &ldquo;I lead
between us. Moghedien is in a bad odor with Moridin for
<em>her</em> recent mistakes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wrapping her arms around herself, Moghedien shot the
silver-haired little woman a scowl as good as any spoken
confirmation. Suddenly Cyndane&rsquo;s big eyes opened even wider,
and she gasped, shuddering.</p>

<p>Moghedien&rsquo;s glare turned malicious. &ldquo;You lead
for the moment,&rdquo; she sneered. &ldquo;Your place in his eyes is not far
better than mine.&rdquo; And then <em>she</em> gave a start and shivered,
biting her lip.</p>

<p>Was she being toyed with, Graendal wondered. The pure
hatred for each other on the two women&rsquo;s faces seemed
unfeigned. Either way, she would see how they enjoyed being played.
Unconsciously rubbing her hands together, rubbing the
<em>angreal</em> on her finger, she moved to a chair without taking
her eyes from the pair. The sweetness of <em>saidar</em> flowing
into her was a comfort. Not that she needed comfort, but there was
something odd here. The high straight back, thickly carved and
gilded, made the chair seem a throne, though it was no different
from any other in the room. Such things affected even the most
sophisticated on levels they never knew consciously.</p>

<p>She sat leaning back with her leg&rsquo;s crossed, one
foot kicking idly, the picture of a woman at her ease, and made her
voice bored. &ldquo;Since you lead, child, tell me, when this man who
calls himself Death is in his skin, who is he? What is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moridin is Nae&rsquo;blis.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s voice was
calm and cold and arrogant. &ldquo;The Great Lord has decided it is time
for you to serve the Nae&rsquo;blis, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Graendal jerked upright. &ldquo;This is preposterous.&rdquo; She
could not keep the anger from her voice. &ldquo;A man I&rsquo;ve never
<em>heard</em> of has been named the Great Lord&rsquo;s Regent on
Earth?&rdquo; She did not mind when others tried to manipulate her&mdash;she always found a way to turn their schemes against them&mdash;but Moghedien must take her for a half-wit! She had no doubt that
Moghedien was directing this obnoxious girl, whatever they claimed,
whatever looks they stabbed at each other. &ldquo;I serve the Great Lord
and myself, no other! I think the two of you should go, now, and
play your little game elsewhere. Demandred might be diverted by it.
Or Semirhage? Be careful how you channel in leaving; I have set a
few inverted webs, and you would not want to trigger one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was a lie, but a very believable one, so it came
as a shock when Moghedien suddenly channeled and every lamp in the
room went out, plunging them into darkness. Instantly Graendal
flung herself from the chair so as not to be where they had last
seen her, and she also channeled even as she moved, weaving a web
of light that hung to one side, a sphere of pure white that cast
lurid shadows about the room. And revealed the pair clearly.
Without hesitation, she channeled again, drawing the full strength
of the little ring. She did not need it all, or even most, but she
wanted every advantage she could find. Attack her, would they! A
net of Compulsion tightened on each of them before they could
twitch.</p>

<p>She had spun the nets strong, for anger&rsquo;s sake,
nearly strong enough to do harm, and the women stood staring at her
adoringly, eyes wide and mouths hanging open in adulation,
intoxicated with worship. They were hers to command, now. If she
told them to cut their own throats, they would. Suddenly Graendal
realized that Moghedien was no longer embracing the Source. This
much Compulsion might have shocked her into letting go. The
servants by the door had not moved, of course.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said a touch breathlessly, &ldquo;you will
answer my questions.&rdquo; She had a number, including who was this
Moridin fellow, if there was such a man, and where had Cyndane come
from, but one piqued her more than the rest. &ldquo;What did you hope to
gain by this, Moghedien? I may decide to knot those webs on you.
You can pay for your game by serving <em>me</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, please,&rdquo; Moghedien groaned, wringing her hands.
She actually began to weep! &ldquo;You will kill us all! Please, you must
serve the Nae&rsquo;blis! That is what we came for. To bring you to
Moridin&rsquo;s service!&rdquo; The silver-haired little woman&rsquo;s face
was a shadowed mask of terror in the pale light, her bosom heaving
as she gulped breath.</p>

<p>Suddenly uneasy, Graendal opened her mouth. This made
less and less sense by the moment. She opened her mouth, and the
True Source vanished. The One Power vanished from her, and
blackness swallowed the room again. Abruptly the caged birds broke
into a frenzy of chirruping; their wings fluttered frantically
against the bamboo bars.</p>

<p>Behind her, a voice rasped like rock being ground to
dust. &ldquo;The Great Lord thought you might not take their word,
Graendal. The time when you could go your own way has passed.&rdquo; A
ball of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;something&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;appeared in the air, a dead black
globe, but a silver light filled the room. The mirrors did not
shine; they seemed to dull in that light. The birds went still,
silent; somehow, Graendal knew they had frozen in terror.</p>

<p>She gaped at the Myrddraal standing there, pale and
eyeless and clothed in black deeper than the ball, but larger than
any she had ever seen. It had to be the reason she could not sense
the Source, but that was impossible! Except&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Where had that
strange sphere of black light come from if not from it? She had
never felt the same fear others did at a Myrddraal&rsquo;s gaze, not
to the same degree, yet her hands rose on their own, and she had to
snatch them down to keep from covering her face. Glancing toward
Moghedien and Cyndane, she flinched. They had adopted the same pose
as her servants, crouching on their knees, heads to the floor
toward the Myrddraal.</p>

<p>She had to work moisture into her mouth. &ldquo;You are a
messenger from the Great Lord?&rdquo; Her voice was steady, but weak. She
had never heard of such a thing, the Great Lord sending a message
by Myrddraal, and yet&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Moghedien was a physical coward, but
still one of the Chosen, and she groveled as assiduously as the
girl. And there was the light. Graendal found herself wishing her
dress were not cut so low. Ridiculous, of course; Myrddraal&rsquo;s
appetites for women were well known, but she was one of the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Her eyes drifted to Moghedien once more.</p>

<p>The Myrddraal strode by her sinuously, seeming not to
pay her any heed. Its long black cloak hung undisturbed by its
movements. Aginor had thought the creatures were not quite in the
world in the same way everything else was; &ldquo;slightly out of phase
with time and reality,&rdquo; he had called it, whatever that meant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Shaidar Haran.&rdquo; Stopping by her servants, the
Myrddraal bent to grip them by the backs of their necks, one hand
to each. &ldquo;When I speak, you may consider that you hear the voice of
the Great Lord of the Dark.&rdquo; Those hands tightened to the
surprisingly loud sound of cracking bone. The young man spasmed as
he died, kicking out; the young woman merely went limp. They had
been two of her prettiest. The Myrddraal straightened from the
corpses. &ldquo;I am his hand in this world, Graendal. When you stand
before me, you stand before him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Graendal considered carefully, if quickly. She was
afraid, an emotion she was far more used to inspiring in others,
but she knew how to control her fear. While she had never commanded
armies as some of the others had, she was neither a stranger to
hazard nor a coward, yet this was more than a mere threat.
Moghedien and Cyndane still knelt with their heads to the marble
floor, Moghedien actually trembling visibly. Graendal believed this
Myrddraal. Or whatever it truly was. The Great Lord <em>was</em>
taking a more direct hand in events, as she had feared. And if he
learned of her scheming with Sammael&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;If he chose to take
action, that was; betting that he did not know was a foolish wager
at this point.</p>

<p>She knelt smoothly before the Myrddraal. &ldquo;What would
you have me do?&rdquo; Her voice had regained its strength. A necessary
flexibility was not cowardice; those who did not bend for the Great
Lord were bent. Or snapped in two. &ldquo;Should I call you Great Master,
or would you prefer another title? I would not feel comfortable
addressing even the Great Lord&rsquo;s hand as I would him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shockingly, the Myrddraal laughed. It sounded like
ice crumbling. Myrddraal never laughed. &ldquo;You are braver than most.
And wiser. Shaidar Haran will do for you. So long as you remember
who I am. So long as you do not let bravery overcome your fear too
far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As it issued its commands&mdash;a visit to this
Moridin was first, it seemed; she would need to be on her guard
against Moghedien, and perhaps Cyndane also, taking revenge for her
brief use of Compulsion; she doubted the girl was any more
forgiving than the Spider&mdash;she decided to keep to herself the
letter she had sent to Rodel Ituralde. Nothing she was told
indicated that her actions would be displeasing to the Great Lord,
and she still had to consider her own position. Moridin, whoever he
was, might be Nae&rsquo;blis today, but there was always
tomorrow.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Bracing herself against the rocking of Arilyn&rsquo;s
coach, Cadsuane moved one of the leather window curtains far enough
to see out. A light rain fell on Cairhien from a gray sky full of
blustering clouds and rough, swirling winds. Not only the sky was
full of wind. Howling gusts rocked the coach more than did its
forward motion. Tiny droplets stung her hand, cold as ice. If the
air cooled a little more, there would be snow. She drew her woolen
cloak closer; she had been pleased to find it, shoved to the bottom
of her saddlebags. The air would cool.</p>

<p>The city&rsquo;s steep slate roofs and stone-paved
streets glistened wetly, and though the rain was not hard, few were
willing to brave the strong winds. A woman guiding an ox-cart with
taps of a long goad moved as patiently as her ox, but most people
afoot clutched cloaks tightly, hoods pulled down, and stepped
quickly as the bearers of a sedan chair rushed by, its stiff <em>con</em>
fluttering. Others beside the woman and her ox saw no reason for
haste, though. In the middle of the street a towering Aielman stood
gaping at the sky in disbelief while the drizzle soaked him, so
absorbed that a daring cutpurse sliced away his belt pouch and
darted off unnoticed by his victim. A woman whose elaborately
curled, high-piled hair marked her as noble walked along slowly,
her cloak flapping wildly, and its long hood as well. This might
have been the first time ever that she had actually walked in the
streets, but she was laughing as the rain slicked her cheeks. From
the doorway of a perfumer&rsquo;s shop, the shopkeeper stared out
disconsolately; she would do little business today. Most of the
hawkers had vanished for the same reason, but a handful still
hopefully cried hot tea and meat pies from barrows beneath
makeshift awnings. Though anyone who bought a meat pie in the
street these days deserved the bellyache she would get.</p>

<p>A pair of starving dogs ran out from an alley,
stiff-legged and hackles up, barking and snarling at the coach.
Cadsuane let the curtain fall. Dogs seemed to know women who could
channel as easily as cats did, but dogs appeared to think the women
were cats, if unnaturally large ones. The pair of women seated
across from her were still in conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; Daigian was saying, &ldquo;but the logic is
inescapable.&rdquo; She ducked her head apologetically, making the
moonstone dangling on a fine silver chain from her long black hair
sway across her forehead. Her fingers plucked the white slashes in
her dark skirts, and she spoke rapidly, as though afraid of being
interrupted. &ldquo;If you accept that the lingering heat was the Dark
One&rsquo;s work, the change must be by some other agency. He would
not have relented. You might say that he has decided to freeze or
drown the world instead of baking it, but why? Had the heat
continued through spring, the dead might well have outnumbered the
living, no different than if snow falls into the summer. Therefore,
logically, some other hand is at work.&rdquo; The plump woman&rsquo;s
diffidence was trying at times, but as always, Cadsuane found her
logic impeccable. She just wished she knew whose hand and to what
end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; Kumira muttered. &ldquo;I would rather an ounce of
hard proof than a hundredweight of your White Ajah logic.&rdquo; She was
Brown, herself, though little given to their usual failings. A
handsome woman with short-cut hair, she was hardheaded and
practical, a keen observer, and never lost herself so deeply in
thought that she lost sight of the world around her as well. No
sooner had Kumira spoken than she patted Daigian&rsquo;s knee with a
graceful hand, and gave a smile that changed her blue eyes from
sharp to warm. Shienarans were a polite people, by and large, and
Kumira took care not to offend. By accident, at least. &ldquo;Put your
mind to what we can do about the sisters held by the Aiel. I know
you&rsquo;ll reason out something if anyone can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cadsuane snorted. &ldquo;They deserve whatever happens to
them.&rdquo; She had not been allowed near the Aiel tents herself, nor
had any of her companions, but some of the fools who had sworn
fealty to the al&rsquo;Thor boy had ventured out to the sprawling
encampment and come back white-faced and torn between outrage and
sicking up. Normally, she also would have been furious over the
affront to Aes Sedai dignity, whatever the circumstances; not now.
To achieve her goal, she would have run the entire White Tower
through the streets naked. How could she concern herself with the
discomfort of women who might have ruined everything?</p>

<p>Kumira opened her mouth to protest despite knowing
her feelings, but Cadsuane went on, calm yet relentless. &ldquo;Perhaps
they&rsquo;ll weep enough to atone for the dog&rsquo;s dinner they
made of matters, but I doubt it. They are out of our hands, and if
they were in mine, I might just <em>give</em> them to the Aiel.
Forget them, Daigian, and put that fine mind of yours on the track
I set you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Cairhienin woman&rsquo;s pale cheeks flushed red
at the compliment. Thank the Light she was not this way except with
other sisters. Kumira sat silently, very smooth-faced, her hands in
her lap. She might be subdued now, but little could subdue Kumira
for long. They were exactly the pair Cadsuane wanted with her
today.</p>

<p>The coach tilted as the team started up the long ramp
leading to the Sun Palace. &ldquo;Remember what I told you,&rdquo; she told the
other two firmly. &ldquo;And have a care!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They murmured that they would, as well they might,
and she nodded. If need demanded, she would use them both for
mulch, and others too, but she did not intend to lose either
because they grew careless.</p>

<p>There was no bother or delay in letting the coach
through the Palace gates. The guards recognized Arilyn&rsquo;s sigil
on the doors, and they knew who would be riding inside. That coach
had been to the Palace often enough in the past week. The moment
the horses halted, an anxious-eyed footman in unadorned black
opened the coach door, holding out a broad flat parasol of dark
oiled cloth. Rain dripped from the edge onto his bare head, but
then, it was not intended for his shelter.</p>

<p>Quickly touching the ornaments dangling from the bun
atop her head to be sure they were all there&mdash;she had never
lost one, but that was because she was careful of them&mdash;Cadsuane gathered the handles of her square wicker sewing basket
from beneath her seat and stepped down. Half a dozen footmen stood
waiting behind the first, parasols at the ready. So many passengers
would have crowded the coach beyond comfort, but the footmen were
not about to be caught short, and the extra did not hurry away
until it was plain there were only the three of them.</p>

<p>Obviously the coach had been seen coming. Dark-garbed
serving men and women made a neat array on the deep blue and gold
tiles of the great entry hall with its square-vaulted ceiling five
spans high. They leaped forward, taking cloaks, offering small,
warm linen towels in case anyone needed to dry face or hands,
proffering Sea Folk porcelain goblets of mulled wine that gave off
a heady scent of spices. A winter drink, yet the sudden drop in
temperature made it suitable. And after all, it <em>was</em>
winter. Finally.</p>

<p>Three Aes Sedai stood waiting to one side among the
massive square columns of dark marble, in front of tall, pale
friezes depicting battles no doubt important to Cairhien, but
Cadsuane ignored the women for the time being. One of the young
serving men had a small red-and-gold figure embroidered on the left
breast of his coat, what people were calling a Dragon. Corgaide,
the grave-faced, gray-haired woman who ordered the servants in the
Sun Palace, wore no ornament save for the large ring of heavy keys
at her waist. Nor did anyone else have any decoration on their
clothes, and despite the young man&rsquo;s apparent enthusiasm, it
was Corgaide, the Holder of the Keys, who would set the mood among
the servants. Still, she had allowed the young fellow his
embroidery; a point to remember. Cadsuane spoke to her quietly,
asking after a room where she might work her embroidery hoop
undisturbed, and the woman did not blink at the request. But then,
doubtless she had heard stranger, serving in this place.</p>

<p>As the servants with the cloaks and trays bowed and
curtsied themselves off, Cadsuane finally turned to the three
sisters among the columns. They were all looking at her, ignoring
Kumira and Daigian. Corgaide remained, but she stayed well back,
giving the Aes Sedai privacy. &ldquo;I hardly expected to find you
strolling about at your ease,&rdquo; Cadsuane said. &ldquo;I thought the Aiel
worked their apprentices hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faeldrin barely reacted, merely a slight jerk of her
head that softly rattled the colored beads in her thin braids, but
Merana colored with embarrassment, and her hands clenched in her
skirts. Events had shaken Merana so deeply that Cadsuane was unsure
she would ever recover. Bera, of course, was very nearly
unflappable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most of us were given a freeday because of the
rain,&rdquo; Bera replied calmly. A sturdy woman in plain wool&mdash;fine and well-cut, but decidedly plain&mdash;you might have
thought her more at home on a farm than in a palace. You might if
you were a fool; Bera had a keen mind, a strong will, and Cadsuane
did not believe she ever made the same mistake twice. Like most
sisters, she had not entirely gotten over meeting Cadsuane
Melaidhrin, alive and in the flesh, yet she did not let awe rule
her. After only the slightest of deep breaths, she went on. &ldquo;I
cannot understand why you keep coming back, Cadsuane. Clearly, you
want something from us, but unless you tell us what it is, we
cannot help you. We know what you did for the Lord Dragon&rdquo;&mdash;she stumbled a little over the title; they still were not quite
sure what to call the boy&mdash;&ldquo;but it&rsquo;s obvious you came to
Cairhien because of him, and until you tell us why and what you
intend, you must understand that you&rsquo;ll find no aid from us.&rdquo;
Faeldrin, another Green, gave a start at Bera&rsquo;s bold tone, but
she was nodding agreement before Bera finished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must understand this, too,&rdquo; Merana added, her
serenity regained. &ldquo;If we decide we must oppose you, we will.&rdquo;
Beta&rsquo;s face did not change, but Faeldrin&rsquo;s mouth
tightened briefly. Perhaps she disagreed, and perhaps she did not
want to reveal too much.</p>

<p>Cadsuane favored them with a thin smile. Tell them
why and what? If <em>they</em> decided? So far they had managed to
stuff themselves into young al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s saddlebags tied
hand and foot, even Bera. Small recommendation for letting them
decide so much as what to wear in the morning! &ldquo;I did not come to
see you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Though I suppose Kumira and Daigian would
enjoy a visit, since you have a freeday. You will excuse me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Motioning Corgaide to lead on, she followed the woman
across the entry hall. She only glanced back once. Bera and the
others had already gathered up Kumira and Daigian and were hustling
them away, but hardly like welcome guests. More like herded geese.
Cadsuane smiled. Most sisters considered Daigian little better than
a wilder and treated her little better than a servant. In that
company, Kumira hardly stood much higher. The most suspicious could
not think they were there to try to convince anyone of anything. So
Daigian would pour the tea and sit quietly except when addressed&mdash;and apply her excellent mind to everything she heard. Kumira
would let everyone except Daigian speak before her&mdash;and sort
and file away every word, every gesture and grimace. Bera and the
rest would keep their oaths to the boy, of course&mdash;that went
without saying&mdash;but how assiduously was another question.
Even Merana might be unwilling to go too far beyond bare obedience.
That was bad enough, yet it left considerable room for them to
maneuver. Or be maneuvered.</p>

<p>Dark-liveried servants hurrying at their tasks along
the broad, tapestry-hung hallways darted aside for Cadsuane and
Corgaide, and the two of them progressed to a flurry of deep bows
and curtsies made over baskets and trays and armloads of towels.
From the way eyes watched Corgaide, Cadsuane suspected the
deference was as much for the Holder of the Keys as for an Aes
Sedai. There were a few Aiel about, too, huge men like cold-eyed
lions and women like colder-eyed leopards. Some of those gazes
followed her icily enough to bring on the snow threatened by the
rain outside, but other Aiel nodded to her gravely, and here and
there one of the fierce-eyed women went so far as to smile. She had
never claimed to be responsible for saving their
<em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>, but tales became twisted in
retelling, and the belief granted her more respect than any other
sister, and certainly more freedom of movement around the Palace.
She wondered how they would feel if they knew that had she had the
boy in front of her right then, she would have been hard-pressed to
stop herself from blistering his hide for him! Barely more than a
week since he nearly got himself killed, and not only had he
managed to elude her completely, he had made her task even more
difficult, if half what she heard was true. A pity he had not been
raised in Far Madding. But then, that might have led to its own
catastrophe.</p>

<p>The room Corgaide took her to was comfortably warm,
with fires blazing in marble fireplaces at either end of the
chamber and lamps lit, mirrored flames in glass towers that chased
the day&rsquo;s gloom. Plainly Corgaide had sent orders ahead to
prepare while she was waiting in the entry hall. A serving woman
appeared almost as soon as they, with both hot tea and spiced wine
on a tray, and small cakes glazed with honey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will there be anything else, Aes Sedai?&rdquo; Corgaide
asked as Cadsuane set her sewing basket beside the tray on a table
with edge and legs thickly gilded. Rigidly carved, too, as was the
wide cornice, also covered with gilt. Cadsuane always felt she was
in a golden fish weir when she visited Cairhien. Despite the light
and warmth inside, rain dripping outside the tall narrow windows
and the gray sky outside heightened the sensation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The tea will do nicely,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you will,
tell Alanna Mosvani that I want to see her. Tell her, without
delay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Corgaide&rsquo;s keys jingled as she curtsied,
murmuring respectfully that she would find &ldquo;Alanna Aes Sedai&rdquo;
herself. Her grave expression never altered as she left. Very
likely she was examining the request for subtleties. Cadsuane
preferred to be direct, when possible. She had tripped up any
number of clever people who had not believed she meant exactly what
she said.</p>

<p>Opening the lid of her sewing basket, she took out
her embroidery hoop with a less than half-done piece of work
wrapped around it. The basket had pockets woven inside to hold
items that had nothing to do with sewing. Her ivory hand mirror and
hairbrush and comb, a pen case and tightly stoppered ink bottle, a
number of things that she had found useful to have at hand over the
years, including some that would have surprised anyone with nerve
enough to search the basket. Not that she often left it out of her
sight. Setting the polished silver thread box carefully on the
table, she selected the skeins she needed and sat with her back to
the door. The major image on her piece of embroidery was finished,
a man&rsquo;s hand clutching the ancient symbol of the Aes Sedai.
Cracks ran across the black-and-white disc, and there was no
telling whether the hand was trying to hold it together or crush
it. She knew what she intended, but time would tell what was
truth.</p>

<p>Threading a needle, she set to work on one of the
surrounding images, a bright red rose. Roses and starblaze and
sunburst alternated with daisies and heartsblush and snowcap, all
separated by bands of stark nettles and long-thorned briars. It
would be a disturbing piece, when completed.</p>

<p>Before she had finished half a petal on the rose, a
flash of motion reflected on the flat lid of the thread box caught
her eye. It had been carefully placed to reflect the doorway. She
did not raise her head from the hoop. Alanna stood there glaring at
her back. Cadsuane continued the slow work of her needle, but she
watched that reflection from the corner of her eye. Twice Alanna
half turned as if to go, then finally drew herself up, visibly
steeling herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in, Alanna.&rdquo; Still not raising her head,
Cadsuane pointed to a spot in front of her. &ldquo;Stand there.&rdquo; She
smiled wryly as Alanna jumped. There were advantages to being a
legend; people seldom noticed the obvious when dealing with a
legend.</p>

<p>Alanna stalked into the room in a swish of silk
skirts and took the place Cadsuane had indicated, but there was a
sulky twist to her mouth. &ldquo;Why do you persist in badgering me?&rdquo; she
demanded. &ldquo;I cannot tell you any more than I have. And if I could,
I don&rsquo;t know that I would! He belongs to&mdash;!&rdquo; She cut off
abruptly, biting her lower lip, but she might as well have
finished. The al&rsquo;Thor boy belonged to her; her Warder. She had
the gall to think that!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have kept your crime to myself,&rdquo; Cadsuane said
quietly, &ldquo;but only because I saw no reason to complicate matters.&rdquo;
Lifting her eyes to the other woman, she kept her voice soft. &ldquo;If
you think that means I won&rsquo;t core you like a cabbage, think
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alanna stiffened. The light of <em>saidar</em>
suddenly shone around her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you wish to be truly foolish.&rdquo; Cadsuane smiled, a
cold smile. She made no move to embrace the Source herself. One of
her dangling hair ornaments, intertwined golden crescents, was cool
on her temple. &ldquo;You keep a whole hide at present, but my sufferance
is not infinite. In fact, it dangles by a thread.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alanna struggled with herself, unconsciously
smoothing blue silk. Abruptly the glow of the Power winked out, and
she turned her head away from Cadsuane so swiftly that her long
black hair swung. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know any more to tell.&rdquo; The sullen
words rushed out of her breathily. &ldquo;He was injured, and then not,
but I don&rsquo;t think a sister Healed him. The wounds no one could
Heal are still there. He leaps about, Traveling, but he&rsquo;s
still in the south. Somewhere in Illian, I think, but at this
distance, he could be in Tear for all I know. He&rsquo;s full of
rage, and pain, and suspicion. There isn&rsquo;t any more, Cadsuane.
There isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Careful of the silver pitcher&rsquo;s heat, Cadsuane
poured a cup of tea, testing the thin green porcelain cup for
warmth. As might have been expected in silver, the tea had cooled
quickly. Channeling briefly, she heated it again. The dark tea
tasted too much of mint; Cairhienin used mint entirely too freely
in her opinion. She did not offer a cup to Alanna. Traveling. How
<em>could</em> the boy have rediscovered what had been lost to the
White Tower since the Breaking? &ldquo;You will keep me fully informed,
however, won&rsquo;t you, Alanna.&rdquo; That was not a question. &ldquo;Look at
me, woman! If you <em>dream</em> of him, I want every detail!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unshed tears glistened in Alanna&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;In my
place, you would have done the same!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cadsuane scowled over the cup at her. She might have.
There was no difference between what Alanna had done and a man
forcing himself on a woman, but, the Light help her, she might
have, had she believed it would help her reach her goal. Now, she
no longer considered even making Alanna pass the bond to her.
Alanna had proved how useless that was in controlling him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not keep me waiting, Alanna,&rdquo; she said in an icy
tone. She had no sympathy for the other woman. Alanna was another
in a line of sisters, from Moiraine to Elaida, who had bungled and
worsened what they should have been mending. While she herself had
been off chasing first Logain Ablar and then Mazrim Taim. Which did
not soothe her mood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will keep you fully informed,&rdquo; Alanna sighed,
pouting like a girl. Cadsuane itched to slap her. Alanna had worn
the shawl almost forty years; she should have grown up more than
this. Of course, she was Arafellin. In Far Madding, few girls of
twenty sulked and pouted as much as an Arafellin could on her aged
deathbed.</p>

<p>Abruptly, Alanna&rsquo;s eyes widened in alarm, and
Cadsuane saw another face reflected in the lid of her thread box.
Setting the cup back on the tray and her embroidery hoop on the
table, Cadsuane stood and turned to the door. She did not hurry,
but she did not dally or play games as she had with Alanna,
either.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you done with her, Aes Sedai?&rdquo; Sorilea asked,
stepping into the room. The leathery, white-haired Wise One spoke
to Cadsuane, but her eyes remained on Alanna. Ivory and gold
clicked softly at her wrists as she planted hands on her hips, and
her dark shawl slid to her elbows.</p>

<p>When Cadsuane said that she was indeed done, Sorilea
gestured curtly to Alanna, who stalked from the room. Flounced
might have been a better word, with sullen irritation on her face.
Sorilea frowned after her. Cadsuane had encountered the woman
before, and interesting encounters they had been, if brief. She had
not met many people she considered formidable, but Sorilea was one.
Perhaps even a match for herself, in some ways. She also suspected
the woman was as old as she was, maybe older, and that, she had
never expected to find.</p>

<p>No sooner had Alanna vanished than Kiruna appeared in
the doorway, kicking gray silk skirts in her hurry and peering down
the hall in the direction Alanna had gone. And carrying an
intricately worked golden tray that held an even more elaborate
golden pitcher with a high neck, and, incongruously, two small,
white-glazed pottery cups. &ldquo;Why is Alanna running?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
would have been faster, Sorilea, but&mdash;&rdquo; She saw Cadsuane
then, and her cheeks went the deepest possible crimson.
Embarrassment looked quite odd on the statuesque woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put the tray on the table, girl,&rdquo; Sorilea said, &ldquo;and
go to Chaelin. She will be waiting to give you your lessons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stiffly, Kiruna set her burden down, avoiding
Cadsuane&rsquo;s eyes. As she turned to go, Sorilea caught her chin
in sinewy fingers. &ldquo;You have begun to make a true effort, girl,&rdquo;
the Wise One told her firmly. &ldquo;If you continue, you will do very
well. Very well. Now, go. Chaelin is not as patient as I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sorilea waved toward the corridor, but Kiruna stood
staring at her for a long moment, a strange expression on her face.
If Cadsuane had had to make a wager, she would have called Kiruna
pleased at the praise and surprised at being pleased. The
white-haired woman opened her mouth, and Kiruna gave herself a
shake and hurried from the room. A remarkable show.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you really think she will learn your ways of
weaving <em>saidar</em>?&rdquo; Cadsuane asked, hiding her incredulity.
Kiruna and the others had told her of these lessons, but many of
the Wise Ones&rsquo; weaves were very different from those taught in
the White Tower. The first way you learned the weave for a
particular thing imprinted itself on you; learning a second was all
but impossible, and even when you could learn, the second-learned
weave almost never worked nearly as well. That was one reason some
sisters did not welcome wilders to the Tower at any age; too much
might have been learned already, and could not be unlearned.</p>

<p>Sorilea shrugged. &ldquo;Perhaps. Learning a second way is
hard enough without all the hand-waving you Aes Sedai do. The main
thing Kiruna Nachiman must learn is that she owns her pride; it
does not own her. She will be a very strong woman once she learns
that.&rdquo; Pulling a chair around to face the one Cadsuane had been
sitting in, she eyed it doubtfully, then sat down. She appeared
almost as stiff and uncomfortable as Kiruna had, but she motioned
authoritatively for Cadsuane to sit, a strong-willed woman used to
command.</p>

<p>Cadsuane swallowed a rueful chuckle as she took her
chair. It was well to be reminded that, wilders or not, the Wise
Ones were far from ignorant savages. Of course they would know the
difficulties. As for hand-waving&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Few had channeled where she
could see, but she had noticed that they created some weaves
without the gestures that sisters used. The hand movements were not
truly part of the weave, but in a way they were, because they had
been part of learning the weave. Perhaps, once, there had been Aes
Sedai who could, say, hurl a ball of fire without some sort of
throwing motion, but if so, they were long dead, and their
teachings with them. Today, some things just could not be done
without the appropriate gestures. There were sisters who claimed
they could tell who had taught another sister by which motions she
used for which weaves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Teaching any of our new apprentices anything has
been difficult at best,&rdquo; Sorilea went on. &ldquo;I do not speak to
offend, but you Aes Sedai give oath, it seems, and immediately try
to find a way around it. Alanna Mosvani is particularly difficult.&rdquo;
Suddenly her clear green eyes were very sharp on Cadsuane&rsquo;s
face. &ldquo;How can we punish her willful failings if it means harming
the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cadsuane folded her hands in her lap. Masking
surprise was not easy. So much for the secret of Alanna&rsquo;s
crime. But why had the woman let her know that she knew? Perhaps
one revelation called for another. &ldquo;The bond does not work in that
fashion,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you kill her, he will die, then or soon
after. Short of that, he will be aware of what happens to her, but
he will not really feel it. As far away as he is now, he will only
be vaguely aware, at that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sorilea nodded slowly. Her fingers touched the golden
tray on the table, then came away. Her expression was as hard to
read as the face of a statue, but Cadsuane suspected that Alanna
would find an unpleasant surprise the next time she let her temper
flare, or threw one of her Arafellin sulks. That was unimportant,
though. Only the boy was important.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most men will take what is offered, if it seems
attractive and pleasant,&rdquo; Sorilea said. &ldquo;Once, we thought of Rand
al&rsquo;Thor so. Unfortunately, it is too late to change the path
we walk. Now, he suspects whatever is offered freely. Now, if I
wanted him to accept something, I would pretend I did not want him
to have it. If I wanted to stay close to him, I would pretend
indifference to whether I ever saw him again.&rdquo; Once more, those
eyes focused on Cadsuane, green augers. Not trying to see what lay
inside her head. The woman knew. Some, at least. Enough, or too
much.</p>

<p>Still, Cadsuane felt a rising thrill of possibility.
If she had had any doubts that Sorilea wanted to feel her out, they
were gone. And you did not feel out someone in this manner unless
you hoped for some agreement. &ldquo;Do you believe a man must be hard?&rdquo;
she asked. She was taking a chance. &ldquo;Or strong?&rdquo; By her tone, she
left no doubt she saw a difference.</p>

<p>Again Sorilea touched the tray; the smallest of
smiles might have quirked her lips for an instant. Or not. &ldquo;Most
men see the two as one and the same, Cadsuane Melaidhrin. Strong
endures; hard shatters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cadsuane drew breath. A chance she would have scoured
anyone else for taking. But she was not anyone else, and sometimes
chances had to be taken. &ldquo;The boy confuses them,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He
needs to be strong, and makes himself harder. Too hard, already,
and he will not stop until he is stopped. He has forgotten how to
laugh except in bitterness; there are no tears left in him. Unless
he finds laughter and tears again, the world faces disaster. He
must learn that even the Dragon Reborn is flesh. If he goes to
Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don as he is, even his victory may be as
dark as his defeat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sorilea listened intently, and kept silent even after
Cadsuane finished. Those green eyes studied her. &ldquo;Your Dragon
Reborn and your Last Battle are not in our prophecies,&rdquo; Sorilea
said at last. &ldquo;We have tried to make Rand al&rsquo;Thor know his
blood, but I fear he sees us as only another spear. If one spear
breaks in your hand, you do not pause to mourn before taking up
another. Perhaps you and I aim at targets not too far apart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we do,&rdquo; Cadsuane said cautiously. Targets
even a hand apart might be not at all alike.</p>

<p>Abruptly, the glow of <em>saidar</em> surrounded the
leather-faced woman. She was weak enough to make Daigian look at
least moderately strong. But then, Sorilea&rsquo;s strength did not
lie in the Power. &ldquo;There is a thing you may find useful,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I cannot make it work, but I can weave the flows to show you.&rdquo; She
did just that, laying feeble skeins that fell into place and
melted, too poor to do what they were intended for. &ldquo;It is called
Traveling,&rdquo; Sorilea said.</p>

<p>This time, Cadsuane&rsquo;s jaw dropped. Alanna and
Kiruna and the rest denied teaching the Wise Ones how to link, or a
number of other skills they suddenly seemed to have, and Cadsuane
had assumed the Aiel had managed to wring them out of the sisters
held in the tents. But this was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Impossible, she would have said, yet she did not
believe Sorilea was lying. She could hardly wait to try the weave
herself. Not that it was of much use immediately. Even if she knew
exactly where the wretched boy was, she had to make him come to
her. Sorilea was right about that. &ldquo;A very great gift,&rdquo; she said
slowly. &ldquo;I have nothing I can give you to compare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This time, there was no doubt of the brief smile that
flashed across Sorilea&rsquo;s lips. She knew very well that
Cadsuane was in her debt. Taking up the heavy golden pitcher with
both hands, she carefully filled the small white cups. With plain
water. She did not spill a drop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I offer you water oath,&rdquo; she said solemnly, picking
up one of the cups. &ldquo;By this, we are bound as one, to teach Rand
al&rsquo;Thor laughter and tears.&rdquo; She sipped, and Cadsuane imitated
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are bound as one.&rdquo; And if their targets turned
out not to be the same at all? She did not underestimate Sorilea as
ally or opponent, but Cadsuane knew which target had to be struck,
at any cost.</p>
