<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">H</span>olding
his fur-lined cloak close with one hand,
Perrin let Stayer walk at the bay&rsquo;s own pace. The midmorning
sun gave no warmth, and the rutted snow on the road leading into
Abila made poor footing. He and his dozen companions shared the way
with only two lumbering ox-carts and a handful of farmfolk in plain
dark woolens. They all trudged along with heads down, clutching at
hat or cap whenever a gust rose but otherwise concentrating on the
ground beneath their shoes.</p>

<p>Behind him, he heard Neald make a ribald joke in a
low voice; Grady grunted in reply, and Balwer sniffed prissily.
None of the three seemed at all affected by what they had seen and
heard this past month since crossing the border into Amadicia, or
by what lay ahead. Edarra was sharply berating Masuri for letting
her hood slip. Edarra and Carelle both wore their shawls wrapped
around their heads and shoulders in addition to cloaks, but even
after admitting the necessity to ride, they had refused to change
out of their bulky skirts, so their dark-stockinged legs were bared
above the knee. The cold did not seem to bother them in the least;
just the strangeness of snow. Carelle began quietly advising Seonid
as to what would happen if she did not keep her face hidden.</p>

<p>Of course, if she let her face be seen too soon, a
dose of the strap would be the least she had to fear, as she and
the Wise One knew well. Perrin did not have to look back to know
the sisters&rsquo; three Warders, bringing up the rear in ordinary
cloaks, were men expecting the need at any moment to out sword and
carve a way clear. They had been that way since leaving the camp at
dawn. He ran a gloved thumb along the axe hanging at his belt, then
regathered his own cloak just before a sudden gust could make it
billow. If this went badly, the Warders might be right.</p>

<p>Off to the left, short of where the road crossed a
wooden bridge over a frozen stream that twisted along the
town&rsquo;s edge, charred timbers thrust out of the snow atop a
large square stone platform with drifts piled around the bottom.
Slow to proclaim allegiance to the Dragon Reborn, the local lord
had been lucky merely to be flogged and fined all that he
possessed. A knot of men standing at the bridge watched the mounted
party approaching. Perrin saw no sign of helmets or armor, but
every man clutched spear or crossbow almost as hard as he did his
cloak. They did not talk to one another. They just watched, the
mist of their breath curling before their faces. There were other
guards bunched all around the town, at every road leading out, at
every space between two buildings. This was the Prophet&rsquo;s
country, but the Whitecloaks and King Ailron&rsquo;s army still held
large parts of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was right not to bring her,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;ll pay for it anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;ll pay,&rdquo; Elyas snorted. For a man
who had spent most of the last fifteen years afoot, he handled his
mouse-colored gelding well. He had acquired a cloak lined with
black fox, dicing with Gallenne. Aram, riding on Perrin&rsquo;s
other side, eyed Elyas darkly, but the bearded man ignored him.
They did not get on well. &ldquo;A man always pays sooner or later, with
any woman, whether he owes or not. But I was right, wasn&rsquo;t
I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin nodded. Grudgingly. It still did not seem
right taking advice about his wife from another man, even
circumspectly, obliquely, yet it did seem to be working. Of course,
raising his voice to Faile was as hard as not raising it to
Berelain, but he had managed the last quite often and the first
several times. He had followed Elyas&rsquo; advice to the letter.
Well, most of it. As well as he could. That spiky scent of jealousy
still flared at the sight of Berelain, yet on the other hand, the
hurt smell had vanished as they made their slow way south. Still,
he was uneasy. When he firmly told her she was not coming with him
this morning, she had not raised a single word of protest! She even
smelled&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;pleased! Among other things, including startled. And
how could she be pleased and angry at the same time? Not a scrap of
it had showed on her face, but his nose never lied. Somehow, it
seemed that the more he learned about women, the less he knew!</p>

<p>The bridge guards frowned and fingered their weapons
as Stayer&rsquo;s hooves thudded hollowly onto the wooden planking.
They were the usual odd mix that followed the Prophet, dirty-faced
fellows in silk coats too big for them, scar-faced street toughs
and pink-cheeked apprentices, former merchants and craftsmen who
looked as if they had slept in their once fine woolens for months.
Their weapons appeared well cared for, though. Some of the men had
a fever in their eyes; the rest wore guarded, wooden faces. Along
with unwashed, they smelled eager, anxious, fervent, afraid, all
jumbled together.</p>

<p>They made no move to bar passage, just watched,
hardly blinking. By what Perrin had heard, all sorts from ladies in
silks to beggars in rags came to the Prophet hoping that submitting
to him in person might gain added blessings. Or maybe added
protection. That was why he had come this way, with only a handful
of companions. He would frighten Masema if he had to, if Masema
could be frightened, but it had seemed better to try reaching the
man without fighting a battle. He could feel the guard&rsquo;s eyes
on his back until he and the others were all across the short
bridge and onto the paved streets of Abila. When that pressure
left, though, it brought no sense of relief.</p>

<p>Abila was a goodly sized town, with several tall
watch towers and many buildings rising four stories, every last one
roofed in slate. Here and there, mounded stone and timbers filled a
gap between two structures where an inn or some merchant&rsquo;s
house had been pulled down. The Prophet disapproved of wealth
gained by trade as much as he did carousing or what his followers
called lewd behavior. He disapproved of a great many things, and
made his feelings known with sharp examples.</p>

<p>The streets were jammed with people, but Perrin and
his companions were the only ones on horseback. The snow had long
since been trampled to half-frozen ankle-deep mush. Plenty of
oxcarts made their slow way through the throng, but very few
wagons, and not a single carriage. Except for those wearing worn
castoffs or possibly stolen clothes, everyone wore drab woolens.
Most people hurried, but like the folk on the road, with heads
down. Those who did not hurry were straggling groups of men
carrying weapons. In the streets, the smell was mainly dirt and
fear. It made Perrin&rsquo;s hackles rise. At least, if it came to
that, getting out of a town with no wall would not prove harder
than getting in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; Balwer murmured as they came abreast of
one of those heaps of rubble. He barely waited for Perrin&rsquo;s
nod before turning his hammer-nosed mount aside and making his way
in another direction, hunched in his saddle with his brown cloak
held tight around him. Perrin had no worries about the dried-up
little man going off alone, even here. For a secretary, he managed
to learn a surprising amount on these forays of his. He seemed to
know what he was about.</p>

<p>Dismissing Balwer from his thoughts, Perrin set to
what <em>he</em> was there about.</p>

<p>It took only one question, put to a lanky young man
with an ecstatic light on his face, to learn where the Prophet was
staying, and three more to other folk in the streets to find the
merchant&rsquo;s house, four stories of gray stone with white marble
moldings and window frames. Masema disapproved of grubbing for
money, but he was willing to accept accommodations from those who
did. On the other hand, Balwer said he had slept in a leaky
farmhouse as often and been as satisfied. Masema drank only water,
and wherever he went, he hired a poor widow and ate the food she
prepared, fair or foul, without complaint. The man had made too
many widows for that charity to count far with Perrin.</p>

<p>The throng that packed the streets elsewhere was
absent in front of the tall house, yet the number of armed guards
like those at the bridge almost made up for it. They stared at
Perrin sullenly, those who did not sneer insolently. The two Aes
Sedai kept their faces hidden in their deep hoods and their heads
down, white breath rising from the cowls like steam. From the
corner of his eye, Perrin saw Elyas thumbing the hilt of his long
knife. It was hard not to stroke his axe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come with a message for the Prophet from
the Dragon Reborn,&rdquo; he announced. When none of the men moved, he
added, &ldquo;My name is Perrin Aybara. The Prophet knows me.&rdquo; Balwer had
cautioned him about the dangers of using Masema&rsquo;s name, or
calling Rand anything but the Lord Dragon Reborn. He was not there
to start a riot.</p>

<p>The claim of knowing Masema seemed to put a spark
into the guards. Several exchanged wide-eyed looks, and one went
running inside. The rest stared at him as if he were a gleeman. In
a few moments, a woman came to the door. Handsome, with white at
her temples, in a high-necked dress of blue wool that was fine if
unadorned, she might have been the merchant herself. Masema did not
throw those who offered him hospitality into the streets, but their
servants or farmhands usually ended up with one of the bands
&ldquo;spreading the glories of the Lord Dragon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will come with me, Master Aybara,&rdquo; the woman
said calmly, &ldquo;you and your friends, I will take you to the Prophet
of the Lord Dragon, may the Light illumine his name.&rdquo; Calm she
might sound, but terror filled her scent.</p>

<p>Telling Neald and the Warders to watch the horses
until they returned, Perrin followed her inside with the others.
The interior was dark, with few lamps lit, and not much warmer than
outside. Even the Wise Ones seemed subdued. They did not smell
afraid, but almost as close to it as the Aes Sedai, and Grady and
Elyas smelled of wariness, of raised hackles and ears laid back.
Strangely, Aram&rsquo;s scent was eager. Perrin hoped the man did
not try to draw that sword on his back.</p>

<p>The large, carpeted room the woman led them to, with
fires blazing on hearths at either end, might have been a
general&rsquo;s study, every table and half the chairs covered with
maps and papers, and warm enough that Perrin tossed his cloak back
and regretted wearing two shirts under his coat. But it was Masema
standing in the middle of the room who drew his eyes immediately,
like iron filings to a lodestone, a dark, scowling man with a
shaven head and a pale triangular scar on one cheek, in a wrinkled
gray coat and scuffed boots. His deep-set eyes burned with a black
fire, and his scent&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The only name Perrin could give that
smell, steel-hard and blade-sharp and quivering with wild
intensity, was madness. And Rand thought he could put a leash on
this?</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, it is you,&rdquo; Masema growled. &ldquo;I did not think you
would dare show your face. I know what you&rsquo;ve been up to! Hari
told me more than a week ago, and I have kept myself informed.&rdquo; A
man shifted in a corner of the room, a narrow-eyed fellow with a
thrusting nose, and Perrin upbraided himself for not noticing him
before. Hari&rsquo;s green silk coat was much finer than what he had
worn when he denied collecting ears. The fellow rubbed his hands
together and grinned at Perrin viciously, but he kept silent as
Masema went on. The Prophet&rsquo;s voice grew hotter by the word,
not with anger, but as though he meant to burn every syllable deep
into Perrin&rsquo;s flesh. &ldquo;I know about you murdering men who have
come to the Lord Dragon. I know about you trying to carve out your
own kingdom! Yes, I know about Manetheren! About your ambition!
Your greed for glory! You have turned your back on&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly Masema&rsquo;s eyes bulged, and for the first
time, anger flamed in his scent. Hari made a strangled sound and
tried to back through the wall. Seonid and Masuri had lowered their
hoods and stood with bare faces, calm and cool, and plainly Aes
Sedai to anyone who knew the look. Perrin wondered whether they
held the Power. He would have wagered that the Wise Ones did.
Edarra and Carelle were quietly watching every direction at once,
and smooth faces or no, if he had ever seen anyone ready to fight,
it was them. For that matter, Grady wore readiness like his black
coat; maybe he held the Power, too. Elyas was leaning against the
wall beside the open doors, outwardly as composed as the sisters,
but he smelled ready to bite. And Aram stood gazing at Masema with
his mouth hanging open! Light!</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that is true, too!&rdquo; Masema snapped, spittle
flying from his lips. &ldquo;With filthy rumors spreading against the
holy name of the Lord Dragon, you dare to ride with these&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;these&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve sworn fealty to the Lord Dragon,
Masema,&rdquo; Perrin cut in. &ldquo;They serve him! Do you? He sent me to stop
the killing. And to bring you to him.&rdquo; No one was offering him a
chair, so he pushed a stack of papers from one and sat. He wished
the rest would sit, too; shouting seemed harder when you were
sitting down.</p>

<p>Hari goggled at him, and Masema was practically
shaking. Because he had taken a chair without being asked? Oh.
Yes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have given up the names of men,&rdquo; Masema said
coldly. &ldquo;I am simply the Prophet of the Lord Dragon, may the Light
illumine him and the world come to kneel before him.&rdquo; By his tone,
the world and the Light would regret failure equally. &ldquo;There is
much to do here, yet. Great works. All must obey when the Lord
Dragon calls, but in winter, travel is always slow. A delay of a
few weeks will make little difference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can have you in Cairhien today,&rdquo; Perrin said.
&ldquo;Once the Lord Dragon has spoken to you, you can return the same
way and be back here in a few days.&rdquo; If Rand let him return.</p>

<p>Masema actually recoiled. Baring his teeth, he glared
at the Aes Sedai. &ldquo;Some contrivance of the Power? I will not be
touched with the Power! It is blasphemy for mortals to touch
it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin came close to gaping. &ldquo;The Dragon Reborn
channels, man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The blessed Lord Dragon is not as other men,
Aybara!&rdquo; Masema snarled. &ldquo;He is the Light made flesh! I will obey
his summons, but I will not be touched by the filth these women
do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slumping back in the chair, Perrin sighed. If the man
was this bad over Aes Sedai, how would he be when he learned that
Grady and Neald could channel? For a moment, he considered simply
knocking Masema over the head, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Men were passing by in the
corridor, pausing to glance in before hurrying on. All it took was
one of them raising a shout, and Abila could become a
slaughterhouse. &ldquo;Then we ride, Prophet,&rdquo; he said sourly. Light,
Rand had said to keep this secret until Masema stood in front of
him! How to manage that riding all the way to Cairhien? &ldquo;But no
delays. The Lord Dragon is very anxious to talk with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am anxious to speak with the Lord Dragon, may his
name be blessed by the Light.&rdquo; His eyes flickered toward the two
Aes Sedai. He tried to hide it, actually smiling at Perrin. But he
smelled&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;grim. &ldquo;I am very anxious indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">&ldquo;Would my Lady like me to ask one of the handlers to
bring her a hawk?&rdquo; Maighdin asked. One of Alliandre&rsquo;s four
hawk handlers, all men as lean as their birds, urged a sleek
duckhawk wearing a feathered hood onto his heavy gauntlet from the
wooden stand in front of his saddle and lifted the gray bird toward
her. The falcon, with its blue-tipped wings, was on
Alliandre&rsquo;s green-gloved wrist. That bird was reserved to her,
unfortunately. Alliandre knew her place as a vassal, but Faile
understood not wanting to relinquish a favorite bird.</p>

<p>She merely shook her head, and Maighdin bowed in her
saddle and moved her roan mare away from Swallow, far enough not to
intrude but close enough to be at hand without Faile raising her
voice. The dignified golden-haired woman had proved to be every bit
as good a lady&rsquo;s maid as Faile had hoped, knowledgeable,
capable. At least, she had once she learned that whatever their
relative positions with their former mistress, Lini was first among
Faile&rsquo;s serving women, and willing to use her authority.
Surprisingly, that had actually taken an episode with a switch, but
Faile pretended not to know. Only an utter fool embarrassed her
servants. There was still the matter of Maighdin and Tallanvor, of
course. She was certain Maighdin had begun sharing his bed, and if
she found proof, they would marry if she had to turn Lini loose on
both of them. Still, that was a small matter, and could not spoil
her morning.</p>

<p>Hawking had been Alliandre&rsquo;s idea, but Faile had
not objected to a ride through this sparse forest, where snow made
a rolling blanket over everything and lay thick and white on bare
branches. The green of the trees that still held their leaves
seemed sharper. The air was crisp, and it smelled new and
fresh.</p>

<p>Bain and Chiad had insisted on accompanying her, but
they squatted nearby, <em>shoufa</em> wrapped around their heads,
watching her with disgruntled expressions. Sulin had wanted to come
with all of the Maidens, but with a hundred stories of Aiel
depredations floating everywhere, the sight of an Aiel was enough
to send most people in Amadicia running or reaching for a sword.
There must be some truth in those tales, or so many would <em>
not</em> know an Aiel, though the Light alone knew who they were or
where they had come from, yet even Sulin agreed that whoever they
were, they had moved on east, perhaps into Altara.</p>

<p>In any case, this close to Abila, twenty of
Alliandre&rsquo;s soldiers and as many Mayener Winged Guards
provided sufficient escort. The streamers on their lances, red or
green, lifted like ribbons when the breeze stirred. Berelain&rsquo;s
presence was the only blight. Though watching the woman shiver in
her fur-trimmed red cloak, thick enough for two blankets, was
certainly amusing. Mayene did not have a real winter. This was like
the last days of autumn. In Saldaea, the heart of winter could
freeze exposed flesh hard as wood. Faile took a deep breath. She
felt like laughing.</p>

<p>By some miracle, her husband, her beloved wolf, had
begun behaving as he should. Instead of shouting at Berelain or
running from her, Perrin now tolerated the jade&rsquo;s
blandishments, plainly tolerated them the way he would a child
playing around his knees. And best of all, there was no longer any
need to tamp down her anger when she wanted to let it loose. When
she shouted, he shouted back. She knew he was not Saldaean, but it
had been so hard, thinking in her heart of hearts that he believed
her too weak to stand up to him. A few nights ago at supper, she
had almost pointed out to him that Berelain was going to fall out
of her dress if she leaned over the table any further. Well, she
was not going to that far, not with Berelain; the trull <em>
still</em> thought she could win him. And that very morning, he had
been commanding, quietly brooking no argument, the sort of man a
woman knew she had to be strong to deserve, to equal. Of course,
she would have to nip him over that. A commanding man was
wonderful, so long as he did not come to believe he could always
command. Laugh? She could have sung!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maighdin, I think after all I will&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Maighdin
was there immediately with an inquiring smile, but Faile trailed
off at the sight of three riders ahead of her, plowing through the
snow as fast as they could push their horses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least there are plenty of hares, my Lady,&rdquo;
Alliandre said, walking her tall white gelding up beside Swallow,
&ldquo;but I had hoped&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Who are they?&rdquo; Her falcon shifted on her
thick glove, the bells on its jesses jingling. &ldquo;Why, it looks like
some of your people, my Lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faile nodded grimly. She recognized them, too.
Parelean, Arrela and Lacile. But what were they doing here?</p>

<p>The three drew rein before her, their horses panting
steam. Parelean looked as wide-eyed as his dapple. Lacile, her pale
face nearly hidden in the deep cowl of her cloak, was swallowing
anxiously, and Arrela&rsquo;s dark face seemed gray. &ldquo;My Lady,&rdquo;
Parelean said urgently, &ldquo;dire news! The Prophet Masema has been
meeting with the Seanchan!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Seanchan!&rdquo; Alliandre exclaimed. &ldquo;Surely he
cannot believe <em>they</em> will come to the Lord Dragon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might be simpler,&rdquo; Berelain said, heeling her
too-showy white mare up on Alliandre&rsquo;s other side. Without
Perrin about for her to try to impress, her dark blue riding dress
was cut quite modestly, with a neck up under her chin. She still
shivered. &ldquo;Masema dislikes Aes Sedai, and the Seanchan keep women
who can channel as prisoners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faile clicked her tongue in vexation. Dire news
indeed, if true. And she could only hope Parelean and the others
retained enough of their wits to at least pretend they had simply
overheard talk by chance. Even so, she had to be sure, and quickly.
Perrin might already have reached Masema. &ldquo;What proof do you have,
Parelean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We talked to three farmers who saw a large flying
creature land four nights ago, my Lady. It brought a woman who was
taken to Masema and remained with him for three hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were able to trace her all the way to where
Masema stays in Abila,&rdquo; Lacile added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The three men all thought the creature was
Shadowspawn,&rdquo; Arrela put in, &ldquo;but they seemed fairly reliable.&rdquo; For
her to say any man not of <em>Cha Faile</em> was fairly reliable
was the same as anyone else saying they thought he was honest as a
bell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I must ride into Abila,&rdquo; Faile said,
gathering Swallow&rsquo;s reins. &ldquo;Alliandre, take Maighdin and
Berelain with you.&rdquo; Any other time, the tightening of
Berelain&rsquo;s lips over that would have been amusing. &ldquo;Parelean,
Arrela and Lacile will accompany me&mdash;&rdquo; A man screamed, and
everyone jerked.</p>

<p>Fifty paces away, one of Alliandre&rsquo;s
green-coated soldiers was toppling from his saddle, and a moment
later, a Winged Guard fell with an arrow standing out from his
throat. Aiel appeared among the trees, veiled and wielding bows as
they ran. More soldiers fell. Bain and Chiad were on their feet,
dark veils hiding their faces to the eyes; their spears were thrust
through the straps of the bow cases on their back, and they worked
their bows smoothly, but they cast glances toward Faile, too. There
were Aiel all around, hundreds it seemed, a great noose closing in.
Mounted soldiers lowered lances, pulling back in their own circle
around Faile and the others, but gaps appeared immediately as Aiel
arrows struck home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Someone must get this news of Masema to Lord
Perrin,&rdquo; Faile told Parelean and the two women. &ldquo;One of you must
reach him! Ride like fire!&rdquo; Her sweeping gaze took in Alliandre and
Maighdin. And Berelain, too. &ldquo;All of you, ride like fire, or die
here!&rdquo; Barely waiting for their nods, she suited actions to words,
and dug her heels into Swallow&rsquo;s flanks, bursting through the
useless ring of soldiers. &ldquo;Ride!&rdquo; she shouted. Someone had to get
the news to Perrin. &ldquo;Ride!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leaning low on Swallow&rsquo;s neck, she urged the
black mare for speed. Fleet hooves splashed snow as Swallow ran,
light as her namesake. For a hundred strides, Faile thought she
might break free. And then Swallow screamed and stumbled, pitching
forward with the sharp snap of a breaking leg. Faile flew through
air and struck hard, most of the breath driven out of her as she
plunged facedown into the snow. Fighting for air, she struggled to
her feet and snatched a knife from her belt. Swallow had screamed
before she stumbled, before that awful crack.</p>

<p>A veiled Aielman loomed up before her as if out of
the air, chopping at her wrist with a stiffened hand. Her knife
dropped from suddenly numb fingers, and before she could try to
draw another with her left hand, the man was on her.</p>

<p>She fought, kicking, punching, even biting, but the
fellow was as wide as Perrin and a head taller. He seemed as hard
as Perrin, too, for all the impression she made on him. She could
have wept with frustration at the humiliating ease with which he
handled her, first rooting out all of her knives and tucking them
behind his belt, then using one of her own blades to cut her
clothes away. Almost before she knew it, she was naked in the snow,
her elbows bound together behind her back with one of her
stockings, the other tied about her neck for a leash.</p>

<p>She had no choice except to follow him, shivering and
stumbling through the snow. Her skin pebbled with the cold. Light,
how she had ever thought this day anything less than icy? Light, if
only someone had managed to escape with the news of Masema! To
carry word of her capture to Perrin, of course, but she could
escape somehow. The other was more important.</p>

<p>The first body she saw was Parelean, sprawled on his
back with his sword in one outflung hand and blood all over his
fine coat with the satin-striped sleeves. There were plenty of
corpses after, Winged Guards in their red breastplates,
Alliandre&rsquo;s soldiers in their dark green helmets, one of the
hawkers, the hooded duckhawk flapping vainly against the jesses
still gripped in the dead man&rsquo;s fist. She held on to hope,
though.</p>

<p>The first other prisoners she saw, kneeling among
some Aiel, men and Maidens with their veils hanging down their
chests, were Bain and Chiad, each naked, unbound hands on her
knees. Blood ran down across Bain&rsquo;s face and matted her
flame-red hair. Chiad&rsquo;s left cheek was purple and swollen, and
her gray eyes looked slightly glazed. They knelt there,
straight-backed, impassive, and unashamed, but as the big Aielman
pushed her roughly to her knees beside them, they roused
themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is not right, Shaido,&rdquo; Chiad mumbled
angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She does not follow <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>,&rdquo;
Bain barked. &ldquo;You cannot make her <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> will be quiet,&rdquo; a
graying Maiden said absently. Bain and Chiad gave Faile regretful
looks, then settled back to their calm waiting. Huddling, trying to
hide her nakedness against her knees, Faile did not know whether to
weep or laugh. The two women she would have chosen to help her
escape from anywhere, and neither would raise a hand to try because
of <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say again, Efalin,&rdquo; the man who had captured her
muttered, &ldquo;this is foolishness. We travel at a crawl in this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;snow.&rdquo; He said the word awkwardly. &ldquo;There are too many armed men,
here. We should be moving east, not taking more <em>
gai&rsquo;shain</em> to slow us further.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sevanna wants more <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>, Rolan,&rdquo;
the graying Maiden replied. She frowned, though, and her hard gray
eyes seemed disapproving for a moment.</p>

<p>Shivering, Faile blinked as the names sank in. Light,
but the cold was making her wits slow. Sevanna. Shaido. They were
in Kinslayer&rsquo;s Dagger, as far from here as was possible to be
without crossing the Spine of the World! Clearly they were not,
though. That was something Perrin should know, another reason for
her to escape soon. There seemed little chance of that, crouching
there in the snow and wondering which bits of her were going to
freeze first. The Wheel was balancing her amusement over
Berelain&rsquo;s shivers with a vengeance. She was actually looking
forward to the thick woolen robes that <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>
wore. Her captors made no move to depart, though. There were other
captives to be brought in.</p>

<p>First was Maighdin, stripped bare and bound as Faile
was, and struggling every step of the way. Until the Maiden who was
pushing her along abruptly kicked her feet out from under her.
Maighdin plunked down sitting in the snow, and her eyes popped so
wide that Faile might have laughed if she had not felt sorry for
the woman. Alliandre came next, bent nearly double in an effort to
shield herself, and then Arrela, who seemed half paralyzed by her
nudity and was almost being dragged by a pair of Maidens. Finally,
another tall Aielman appeared with a furiously kicking Lacile
tucked under one arm like a package.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The rest are dead or escaped,&rdquo; the man said,
dropping the small Cairhienin woman beside Faile. &ldquo;Sevanna will
have to be satisfied, Efalin. She puts too much store in taking
people who wear silk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faile did not struggle at all when she was prodded to
her feet and set to laboring through the snow at the head of the
other prisoners. She was too stunned to fight. Parelean dead,
Arrela and Lacile captive, and Alliandre, and Maighdin. Light,
someone had to warn Perrin about Masema. Someone. It seemed a final
blow. Here she was, shivering and gritting her teeth to keep them
from chattering, trying her best to pretend that she was not stark
naked and bound, on her way to an uncertain captivity. All of that,
and she had to hope that that slinking cat&mdash;that pouting
trull!&mdash;Berelain, had managed to escape so she could reach
Perrin. Alongside everything else, that seemed the worst of
all.</p>

<p class="drop">Egwene walked Daishar along the column of initiates,
sisters on their horses among the wagons, Accepted and novices
afoot despite the snow. The sun was bright in a sky with few
clouds, but mist curled from her gelding&rsquo;s nostrils. Sheriam
and Siuan rode at her back, talking quietly about information
learned from Siuan&rsquo;s eyes-and-ears. Egwene had thought the
fire-haired woman an efficient Keeper once she learned that she was
not the Amyrlin, but day by day, Sheriam seemed to grow ever more
assiduous about her duties. Chesa followed on her tubby mare in
case the Amyrlin wanted anything, and unlike her, she was muttering
again about Meri and Selame both running away, the ungrateful
wretches, leaving her to do the work of three. They rode slowly,
and Egwene very carefully did not look toward the column.</p>

<p>A month of recruiting, a month of the novice book
being open to all, had brought in startling numbers, a flood
anxious to become Aes Sedai, women of every age some from hundreds
of miles away. There were now twice as many novices with the column
as before. Almost a thousand! Most by far would never wear the
shawl, yet the number of them had everyone staring. Some might
cause minor problems, and one, a grandmother named Sharina with a
potential above even that of Nynaeve, certainly had everyone
startled, but it was not the sight of a mother and daughter
squabbling because the daughter would be the stronger by far one
day that she was trying to avoid, or noblewomen who were beginning
to think they had made the wrong choice asking to be tested, or
even Sharina&rsquo;s disturbingly direct looks. The gray-haired
woman obeyed every rule and showed every proper respect, but she
had run her large family by the sheer force of her presence, and
even some of the sisters stepped warily around her. What Egwene did
not want to see were the young women who had joined them two days
before. The two sisters who brought them had been more than
startled to find Egwene as Amyrlin, but their charges could not
believe it, not Egwene al&rsquo;Vere, the Mayor&rsquo;s daughter from
Emond&rsquo;s Field. She did not want to order anyone else punished,
but she would have to if she saw another stick her tongue out at
her.</p>

<p>Gareth Bryne had his army in a wide column, too,
cavalry and foot all arrayed and stretching out of sight through
the trees. The pale sun glinted off breastplates and helmets and
the points of pikes. Horses stamped their hooves in the snow
impatiently.</p>

<p>Bryne walked his sturdy bay to meet her before she
reached the Sitters waiting on their horses, in a large clearing
ahead of both columns. He smiled at her through the face-bars of
his helmet. A reassuring smile, she thought. &ldquo;A fine morning for
it, Mother,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She only nodded, and he fell in behind her, beside
Siuan. Who did not immediately begin spitting at him. Egwene was
not certain exactly what accommodation Siuan had reached with the
man, but she seldom grumbled about him anymore in Egwene&rsquo;s
hearing, and never when he was present. Egwene was glad he was
there, now. The Amyrlin Seat could not let her general know she
wanted his reassurance, but she felt the need of it this
morning.</p>

<p>The Sitters had their horses in a line at the edge of
the trees, and thirteen more sisters sat their mounts a little way
off, watching the Sitters carefully. Romanda and Lelaine spurred
their animals forward almost together, and Egwene could hardly help
sighing as they approached, cloaks flaring behind them, hooves
spraying snow as if at the charge. The Hall obeyed her because it
had no choice. In matters concerning the war against Elaida, they
did, but Light, how they could quibble over what did or did not
concern the war. When it did not, getting anything out of them was
like pulling duck&rsquo;s teeth! Except for Sharina, they might have
found a way to put a stop to accepting women of any age. Even
Romanda was impressed by Sharina.</p>

<p>The pair reined in before her, but before they could
open their mouths, she spoke. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time we got on with it,
daughters, and no time for wasting in idle chatter. Proceed.&rdquo;
Romanda sniffed, though softly, and Lelaine looked as though she
wanted to.</p>

<p>They wheeled their horses as one, then glared at one
another a moment. Events this past month had only heightened their
dislike for each other. Lelaine tossed her head angrily in
concession, and Romanda smiled, a faint curving of her lips. Egwene
almost smiled, too. That mutual animosity was still her greatest
strength in the Hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Amyrlin Seat commands you to proceed,&rdquo; Romanda
announced, raising one hand grandly.</p>

<p>The light of <em>saidar</em> sprang up around the
thirteen sisters near the Sitters, around all of them together, and
a thick slash of silver appeared in the middle of the clearing,
rotating into a gateway ten paces tall and a hundred wide. Falling
snow drifted through from the other side. Shouted orders rose among
the soldiers, and the first armored heavy calvary rode through. The
swirling snow beyond the gateway was too thick to see far, yet
Egwene imagined that she could make out the Shining Walls of Tar
Valon and the White Tower itself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has begun, Mother,&rdquo; Sheriam said, sounding almost
surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has begun,&rdquo; Egwene agreed. And the Light willing,
soon Elaida would fall. She was supposed to wait until Bryne said
sufficient of his soldiers were through, but she could not stop
herself. Digging her heels into Daishar&rsquo;s flanks, she rode
through into the falling snow, onto the plain where Dragonmount
reared black and smoking against a white sky.</p>
