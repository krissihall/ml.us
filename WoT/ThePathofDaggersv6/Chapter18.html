<h4><em>A Peculiar Calling</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">F</span>or
a moment after Egwene descended, no one else
moved. And then the Andorans and Murandians headed for the Sitters,
almost as one. Apparently, a girl Amyrlin&mdash;a girl puppet and
figurehead!&mdash;held no interest, not with ageless faces in
front of them that at least said they actually were speaking to Aes
Sedai. Two or three lords and ladies clustered around each Sitter,
some thrusting their chins demandingly, others diffidently bending
their necks, yet every one insistent on being heard. The sharp
breeze whisked away the mist of their breath and fluttered cloaks
forgotten in the importance of asking their questions. Sheriam was
buttonholed too, by red-faced Lord Donel, who blustered and jerked
bows by turns.</p>

<p>Egwene pulled Sheriam away from the narrow-eyed man.
&ldquo;Find out discreetly all you can about these sisters and Tower
Guards in Andor,&rdquo; she whispered hastily. As soon as she released
the woman, Donel reclaimed her. Sheriam actually looked put-upon,
but her frown disappeared quickly. Donel blinked uneasily as she
began questioning <em>him</em>.</p>

<p>Romanda and Lelaine gazed at Egwene through the crowd
with faces carved from ice, but each had acquired a pair of nobles
who wanted&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Something. Reassurance that there was no hidden
trick in Egwene&rsquo;s words, perhaps. How they would hate doing
that, but dodge and duck as they would&mdash;and they
would!&mdash;there was no way to really avoid that
reassurance without repudiating her on the spot. Even those two
would not go that far. Not here, not publicly.</p>

<p>Siuan slipped close to Egwene, features set in
meekness. Except that her eyes darted, maybe looking for Romanda or
Lelaine coming to seize them where they stood, and forget law,
custom, propriety <em>and</em> who was watching. &ldquo;Shein Chunla,&rdquo;
she all but hissed in a whisper.</p>

<p>Egwene nodded, but <em>her</em> eyes searched for
Talmanes. Most of the men and some of the women were tall enough to
hide him. With everyone shifting about&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She went up on her
toes. Where had he gone to?</p>

<p>Segan planted herself in front of her, fists on her
hips, eyeing Siuan doubtfully. Egwene let her heels down hurriedly.
The Amyrlin could not bob about like a girl at a dance looking for
a boy. A rosebud unfolding. Calm. Serenity. Drat all men!</p>

<p>A slender woman with long dark hair, Segan seemed to
have been born petulant, her full mouth fixed in a pout. Her dress
was good blue wool and made for warmth, but it had far too much
vivid green embroidery across her bosom, and her gloves were bright
enough for a Tinker. She looked Egwene up and down, pursing her
lips, with as much incredulity on her face as she had given Siuan.
&ldquo;What you said about the novice book,&rdquo; she said abruptly. &ldquo;Were you
meaning any woman of any age at all? Any can become Aes Sedai,
then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A question close to Egwene&rsquo;s heart, and an
answer she dearly wanted to give&mdash;along with a box on the ear
for the doubt&mdash;but just then a small gap in the flow of
people showed her Talmanes near the back of the pavilion. Talking
with Pelivar! They stood stiffly, mastiffs not quite ready to show
teeth, yet they were keeping a watch to make sure no one came close
enough to overhear what they had to say. &ldquo;Any woman of any age at
all, daughter,&rdquo; she agreed absently. Pelivar?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Segan said, and haltingly added,
&ldquo;Mother.&rdquo; She sketched a curtsy, the barest hint of one, before
hurrying off. Egwene stared after her. Well, it was a
beginning.</p>

<p>Siuan snorted. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind sailing the Fingers
of the Dragon in the dark if I must,&rdquo; she muttered half under her
breath. &ldquo;We discussed that; we weighed the dangers, and anyway,
there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a gull&rsquo;s last dinner for choice.
But you have to set a fire on deck just to make things interesting.
Netting lionfish isn&rsquo;t enough for you. You have to stuff a
prickleback down your dress, too. You aren&rsquo;t content trying to
wade a school of silver-pike&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene broke in. &ldquo;Siuan, I think I should tell Lord
Bryne you&rsquo;re head over heels in love with him. It&rsquo;s only
fair that he know, don&rsquo;t you agree?&rdquo; Siuan&rsquo;s blue eyes
bulged, and her mouth worked, but all that came out was a sort of
gobbling. Egwene patted her shoulder. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Aes Sedai,
Siuan. Try to maintain at least a little dignity. And try to find
out about those sisters in Andor.&rdquo; The crowd parted again. She saw
Talmanes in a different place, but still on the edge of the
pavilion. And alone, now.</p>

<p>Trying not to hurry, she walked in his direction,
leaving Siuan still gobbling. A pretty, black-haired serving man,
whose bulky woolen breeches could not quite hide neatly turned
calves, offered Siuan a steaming silver cup from a tray. Other
servants were moving about with other silver trays. Refreshment was
being offered, if a bit late. It was much too late for the kiss of
peace. She did not hear what Siuan said as she snatched a cup, but
from the way the fellow jerked and started bobbing bows, he had
received sharp shards of her temper at the least. Egwene
sighed.</p>

<p>Talmanes stood with arms folded, observing the
goings-on with an amused smile that did not reach his eyes. He
seemed poised to explode into motion, but his eyes were tired. At
her approach, he made a respectful leg, but there was a wry touch
to his voice when he said, &ldquo;You changed a border today.&rdquo; He
gathered his cloak against the icy breeze. &ldquo;It has always been&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;fluid&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;between Andor and Murandy, no matter what maps say,
but Andor has never come south in such numbers before. Except for
the Aiel War, and the Whitecloak War, anyway, but they were only
passing through, then. Once they have been here a month, new maps
will show a new line. Look at the Murandians scramble, fawning over
Pelivar and his companions as much as they do the sisters. They are
hoping to make new friends for the new day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To Egwene, trying to conceal her careful watch on
those who might be watching her, it seemed that all of the nobles,
Murandian and Andoran, were intent on the Sitters, crowding around
them. In any case, she had slightly more important matters in mind
than borders. To her, if not to the nobles. Except for brief
moments, none of the Sitters were visible beyond the tops of their
heads. Only Halima and Siuan seemed to notice her, and a babble
like that of a flock of excited geese filled the air. She lowered
her voice, and chose her words carefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friends are always important, Talmanes. You&rsquo;ve
been a good friend to Mat, and I think to me. I hope that
hasn&rsquo;t changed. I hope you&rsquo;ve not told anyone what you
shouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Light, she was anxious, or she would not have been
so direct. Next, she would come right out and ask what he and
Pelivar had been talking about!</p>

<p>Luckily, he did not laugh at her for a blunt-tongued
village woman. Though he might have been thinking it. He studied
her seriously before speaking. In a soft voice. He also knew
caution. &ldquo;Not all men gossip. Tell me, when you sent Mat south, did
you know what you would do here today?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could I know that two months ago? No, Aes Sedai
aren&rsquo;t omniscient, Talmanes.&rdquo; She had hoped for something that
would put her in the place she was, had planned for it, but she had
not known, not back then. She also hoped he did not gossip. Some
men did not.</p>

<p>Romanda started toward her with a firm stride and a
frozen face, but Arathelle intercepted her, catching the Yellow
Sitter&rsquo;s arm and refusing to be put off despite Romanda&rsquo;s
astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you at least tell me where Mat is?&rdquo; Talmanes
asked. &ldquo;On his way to Caemlyn with the Daughter-Heir? Why are you
surprised? A serving woman will speak to a soldier when fetching
water from the same stream. Even when he is a horrible
Dragonsworn,&rdquo; he added dryly.</p>

<p>Light! Men really were&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;inconvenient&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;at
times. The best of them found ways to say exactly the wrong thing
at the wrong moment, to ask the wrong question. Not to mention
inveigling serving women into prattle. So much easier if she could
just lie, but he had given her plenty of room within the Oaths.
Half the truth would suffice, and keep him from haring off to Ebou
Dar. Maybe less than half.</p>

<p>Over in the far corner of the pavilion, Siuan stood
conversing with a tall young redhead with curled mustaches who was
eyeing her as dubiously as Segan had. Nobles usually knew the look
of Aes Sedai. But he held only a part of Siuan&rsquo;s attention.
Her gaze constantly flickered toward Egwene. It seemed to shout,
loud as conscience. Easier. Expedient. What it was to be Aes Sedai.
She had not known about today, only hoped! Egwene expelled an
irritated breath. Burn the woman!</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was in Ebou Dar, the last I heard,&rdquo; she muttered.
&ldquo;But he must be hurrying north as fast as he can by now. He still
thinks he has to save me, Talmanes, and Matrim Cauthon
wouldn&rsquo;t miss the chance to be on the spot so he can say I
told you so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Talmanes did not look at all surprised. &ldquo;I thought it
might be so,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;I have&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;felt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;something, for
weeks now. Others in the Band have, too. Not urgent, but always
there. As if he needed me. As if I should look south, anyway. It
can be peculiar, following a <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose it can,&rdquo; she agreed, hoping none of her
incredulity showed. It was strange enough to think of Mat the
wastrel as leader of the Band of the Red Hand, much less as <em>
ta&rsquo;veren</em>, but surely a <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> had to be
present, nearby at least, to have any effect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat was wrong about you needing rescue. You never
had any intention of coming to me for help, did you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He still spoke softly, but she looked around
hurriedly anyway. Siuan was still watching them. And so was Halima.
Paitr stood much too close to her, puffing and preening and
stroking his mustaches&mdash;from the way he stared down her
dress, he had not mistaken her for a sister, that was certain!&mdash;but she was giving him only half her mind, darting sidelong
glances in Egwene&rsquo;s direction while she smiled up at him
warmly. Everyone else appeared occupied, and no one stood close
enough to hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Amyrlin Seat could hardly go running for
sanctuary, now could she? But there have been times it&rsquo;s been
a comfort knowing you were there,&rdquo; she admitted. Reluctantly. The
Amyrlin Seat was hardly supposed to need a bolt-hole, but it could
do no harm so long as none of the Sitters knew. &ldquo;You <em>have</em>
been a friend, Talmanes. I hope that continues. I truly do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been more&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;open&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;with me than I
expected,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;so I will tell you something.&rdquo; His face
did not change&mdash;to any watcher, he must have seemed as casual
as before&mdash;but his voice dropped to a whisper. &ldquo;I have had
approaches from King Roedran about the Band. It seems he has hopes
of being Murandy&rsquo;s first real king. He wants to hire us. I
would not have considered it, normally, but there is never enough
coin, and with this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;this <em>feel</em> of Mat needing us&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;It might be better if we remain in Murandy. Clear as good glass,
you are where you want to be and have everything in hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He fell silent as a young serving woman curtsied to
offer mulled wine. She wore finely embroidered green wool and a
cloak plush with spotted rabbit. Other servants from the camp were
helping out now, as well, no doubt for something to do besides
stand and shiver. The young woman&rsquo;s round face was decidedly
pinched from the cold.</p>

<p>Talmanes waved her off and pulled his cloak back
around him, but Egwene took a silver cup to gain a moment for
thought. Truly there was little need for the Band any longer.
Despite all the muttering, the sisters took their presence as a
matter of course now, Dragonsworn or not; they no longer feared an
attack, and there had been no real need to use the Band&rsquo;s
presence to prod them into moving since leaving Salidar. The only
true purpose <em>Shen an Calhar</em> served now was to draw
recruits into Bryne&rsquo;s army, men who thought two armies meant a
battle and wanted to be on the side with the greatest numbers. She
had no need of them, but Talmanes had acted as a friend. And she
was Amyrlin. Sometimes friendship and responsibility pushed in the
same direction.</p>

<p>As the serving woman moved off, Egwene laid a hand on
Talmanes&rsquo; arm. &ldquo;You must not do that. Even the Band can&rsquo;t
conquer all of Murandy by itself, and every hand will be against
you. You know very well the one thing that makes Murandians stand
together is foreigners on their soil. Follow us to Tar Valon,
Talmanes. Mat will come there; I have no doubt of that.&rdquo; Mat would
not really believe she was the Amyrlin until he saw her wearing the
stole in the White Tower.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Roedran is no fool,&rdquo; he said placidly. &ldquo;All he wants
us to do is sit and wait, a foreign army&mdash;without Aes Sedai&mdash;and nobody knowing what it is up to. He should not have much
trouble uniting the nobles against us. Then, so he says, we quietly
slip across the border. He thinks he can hold on to them
afterward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She could not stop a touch of heat entering her
voice. &ldquo;And what is to stop him betraying you? If the threat goes
away without a fight, his dream of a united Murandy might, too.&rdquo;
The fool man seemed <em>amused</em>!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not a fool either. Roedran cannot be ready
before spring. This lot would never have stirred from their manors
if the Andorans had not come south, and they were on the march
before the snows began. Before then, Mat will find us. If he is
coming north, he must hear of us. Roedran will have to be satisfied
with whatever he has managed by then. So if Mat does intend to go
to Tar Valon, I may see you there yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene made a vexed sound. It was a remarkable plan,
the sort of thing Siuan might devise, and hardly a scheme she
thought Roedran Almaric do Arreloa a&rsquo;Naloy could carry off.
The fellow was said to be so dissolute he made Mat look wholesome.
But then, it was hardly a scheme she would have believed Roedran
could think up. The only certainty was that Talmanes had made up
his mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want your word, Talmanes, that you won&rsquo;t let
Roedran pull you into a war.&rdquo; Responsibility. The narrow stole
around her neck seemed to weigh ten times more than her cloak. &ldquo;If
he moves sooner than you think, you will leave whether or not Mat
has joined you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could promise, but it is not possible,&rdquo; he
protested. &ldquo;I expect the first raid against my foragers three days
at most after I start moving away from Lord Bryne&rsquo;s army.
Every lordling and farmer will think he can pick up a few horses in
the night, give me a pinprick, and run off to hide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not talking about defending yourself, and
you know it,&rdquo; she said firmly. &ldquo;Your word, Talmanes. Or I will not
allow your agreement with Roedran.&rdquo; The only way to stop it was to
betray it, but she would not leave a war in her wake, a war she had
started by bringing Talmanes here.</p>

<p>Staring at her as if for the first time, he finally
bent his head. Strangely, that seemed more formal than his bow had.
&ldquo;It will be as you say, Mother. Tell me, are you sure you are not
<em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the Amyrlin Seat,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;That is quite
enough for anyone.&rdquo; She touched his arm again. &ldquo;The Light shine on
you, Talmanes.&rdquo; His smile nearly touched his eyes this time.</p>

<p>Inevitably, despite their whispers, their talk had
been noticed. Maybe because of their whispers. The girl who claimed
to be Amyrlin, a rebel against the White Tower, in conversation
with the leader of ten thousand Dragonsworn. Had she made
Talmanes&rsquo; scheme with Roedran harder, or easier? Was war in
Murandy less likely, or more? Siuan and her bloody Law of
Unintended Consequences! Fifty gazes followed her, then darted
away, as she moved through the crowd warming her fingers on her
cup. Well, most darted away. The Sitters&rsquo; faces were all
ageless Aes Sedai serenity, but Lelaine might have been a
brown-eyed crow watching a fish struggle in the shallows, while
Romanda&rsquo;s slightly darker eyes could have drilled holes
through iron.</p>

<p>Trying to keep a watch on the sun outside, she made a
slow circuit through the pavilion. The nobles were still
importuning Sitters, but they moved from one to another as if
seeking better answers, and she began to notice small things. Donel
paused on his way from Janya to Moria, bowing low to Aemlyn, who
acknowledged him with a gracious nod. Cian, turning away from
Takima, curtsied deeply to Pelivar and received a slight bow in
return. There were others, always a Murandian deferring to an
Andoran who responded just as formally. The Andorans tried to
ignore Bryne except for the odd scowl, but any number of Murandians
sought him out, one by one and well away from everyone else, and
from the directions their eyes went, it was plain they were
discussing Pelivar, or Arathelle, or Aemlyn. Perhaps Talmanes had
been right.</p>

<p>She received bows and curtsies, too, though none so
deep as those given Arathelle and Pelivar and Aemlyn, much less the
Sitters. Half a dozen women told her how thankful they were that
matters had been resolved peacefully, though in truth, almost as
many made noncommittal noises or shrugged uneasily when she
expressed the same sentiment, as though they were uncertain it all
<em>would</em> end peacefully. Her assurances that it would were
met with a fervent &ldquo;The Light send it so!&rdquo; or a resigned &ldquo;If the
Light wills.&rdquo; Four called her Mother, one without hesitating first.
Three others said that she was quite lovely, that she had beautiful
eyes, and that she had a graceful carriage, in that order; suitable
compliments perhaps for Egwene&rsquo;s age but not her station.</p>

<p>At least she found one unalloyed pleasure. Segan was
not alone in being intrigued by her announcement concerning the
novice book. Plainly that was why most of the women spoke to her in
the first place. After all, the other sisters might be in rebellion
against the Tower, but she claimed to be the Amyrlin Seat. Their
interest had to be strong to overcome that, though no one wanted to
let it show. Arathelle made the inquiry with a frown that put more
creases in her cheeks. Aemlyn shook her graying head at the answer.
Blocky Cian asked, followed by a sharp-faced Andoran lady named
Negara, then a pretty, big-eyed Murandian called Jennet, and
others. None wanted to know for herself&mdash;several made that
clear quickly, especially the younger women&mdash;but before long,
every single noblewoman there had asked, and several servants as
well, under cover of offering more spiced wine. One, a wiry woman
named Nildra, had come from the Aes Sedai camp.</p>

<p>Egwene felt quite pleased with the seed she had
planted there. She was not so pleased with the men. A few spoke to
her, but only when they came face-to-face and seemed to have no
other choice. A murmured word about the weather, either praising
the end of the drought or deploring the sudden snows, a muttered
hope that the bandit problem would end soon, perhaps with a
significant look toward Talmanes, and they slipped away like
greased pigs. A bear of an Andoran by the name of Macharan tripped
over his own boots to avoid her. In a way, it was hardly
surprising. The women had the justification, if only to themselves,
of the novice book, but the men had only the thought that being
seen conversing with her might tar them with the same brush.</p>

<p>It was really quite discouraging. She did not care
what the men thought about novices, but she very much wanted to
know if they were as fearful as the women that this would come to
blows in the end. Fears like that could fulfill themselves very
easily. At last, she decided there was only one way to find
out.</p>

<p>Pelivar turned from taking a fresh cup of wine from a
tray and started back, with a muffled oath, to keep from bumping
into her; had she stood any closer, she would have had to stand on
his boots. Hot wine splashed over his gloved hand and ran down
under his coatsleeve, producing a curse not so muted. Tall enough
to loom over her, he made a good job of it. His scowl belonged on a
man wanting to send an annoying young woman briskly out of his way.
Or on a man who had nearly stepped on a red adder. She held herself
erect and focused on an image of him as a small boy up to no good;
that always helped; most men seemed to feel it. He muttered
something&mdash;it might have been a polite greeting, or another
oath&mdash;and dipped his head slightly, then tried to step around
her. She side-stepped to stay in front of him. He moved back, and
she followed. He began to look hunted. She decided to try putting
him at ease before pressing the important question. She wanted
answers, not more mumbling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be pleased to hear that the Daughter-Heir
is on her way to Caemlyn, Lord Pelivar.&rdquo; She had heard several of
the Sitters mention that.</p>

<p>His face went blank. &ldquo;Elayne Trakand has a right to
put in her claim to the Lion Throne,&rdquo; he replied in a flat
voice.</p>

<p>Egwene&rsquo;s eyes widened, and he stepped back
again, uncertainly. Perhaps he thought her angry over the absence
of her title, but she barely noticed that. Pelivar had supported
Elayne&rsquo;s mother in her claim for the throne, and Elayne had
been sure he would support her, too. She spoke of Pelivar fondly,
like a favorite uncle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; Siuan murmured at her elbow, &ldquo;we must leave
if you want to be sure of reaching the camp before sunset.&rdquo; She
managed to put considerable urgency into those quiet words. The sun
had passed its peak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is no weather to be in the open at nightfall,&rdquo;
Pelivar said hurriedly. &ldquo;If you will excuse me, I must make ready
to leave.&rdquo; Shoving his cup onto the tray of a passing servant, he
hesitated before halfway making a leg, and stalked off with the air
of a man who had wriggled free of a trap.</p>

<p>Egwene wanted to grind her teeth with frustration.
What <em>did</em> the men think of their agreement? If it could be
called that, the way she had forced it on them. Arathelle and
Aemlyn had more power and influence than most of the men, yet it
was Pelivar and Culhan and the like who rode with the soldiers;
they could still make this flare up in her face like a barrel of
lamp oil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Find Sheriam,&rdquo; she growled, &ldquo;and tell her to get
everyone mounted now, no matter what it takes!&rdquo; She could not give
the Sitters a night to think about what had happened today, to plan
and plot. They <em>had</em> to be back in camp before the sun went
down.</p>
