<h4><em>Answering the Summons</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
great winter tempests called the cemaros
continued to roll up out of the Sea of Storms, harsher than any in
memory. Some said this year the cemaros was trying to make up for
the months of delay. Lightning crackled across the skies, enough to
make the darkness patchy at night. Wind lashed the land and rain
flailed it, turning all but the hardest roads to rivers of mud.
Sometimes the mud froze after nightfall, but sunrise always brought
a thaw, even under a gray sky, and the ground became bogs once
more. Rand was surprised at how much all that hampered his
plans.</p>

<p>The Asha&rsquo;man he had sent for came quickly, at
midmorning the next day, riding out of a gateway into a driving
downpour that obscured the sun so, it might as well have been
twilight. Through the hole in the air, snow fell back in Andor, fat
white flakes swirling about thickly and hiding what lay behind
them. Most of the men in the short column were bundled in heavy
black cloaks, but the rain seemed to slip around them and their
horses. It was not obvious, yet anyone who noticed would look
twice, if not three times. Keeping dry required only a simple
weave, so long as you did not mind flaunting what you were. But
then, the black-and-white disc worked on a crimson circle on the
breast of their cloaks did that. Even half-hidden by the rain,
there was a pride about them, an arrogance in the way they sat
their saddles. A defiance. They gloried in what they were.</p>

<p>Their commander, Charl Gedwyn, was a few years older
than Rand, of middling height and wearing the Sword and Dragon,
like Torval, on a very well cut, high-collared coat of the best
black silk. His sword was mounted lushly with silver, his
silver-worked sword belt fastened with a silver buckle shaped in a
clenched fist. Gedwyn termed himself Tsorovan&rsquo;m&rsquo;hael; in
the Old Tongue, Storm Leader, whatever that was supposed to mean.
It seemed appropriate to the weather, at least.</p>

<p>Even so, he stood just inside the entrance to
Rand&rsquo;s ornate green tent and scowled out at the cascading
rain. A guard of mounted Companions encircled the tent, no more
than thirty paces away, yet they were barely visible. They might
have been statues, ignoring the torrent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you expect me to find anyone in this?&rdquo; Gedwyn
muttered, glancing back over his shoulder at Rand. A tick late, he
added, &ldquo;My Lord Dragon.&rdquo; His eyes were hard and challenging, but
they always were, whether looking at a man or a fence-post.
&ldquo;Rochaid and I brought eight Dedicated and forty Soldiers, enough
to destroy an army or cow ten kings. We might even make an Aes
Sedai blink,&rdquo; he said wryly. &ldquo;Burn me, the pair of us could do a
fair job alone. Or you could. Why do you need anyone else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I expect you to obey, Gedwyn,&rdquo; Rand said coldly.
Storm Leader? And Manel Rochaid, Gedwyn&rsquo;s second, called
himself Baijan&rsquo;m&rsquo;hael, Attack Leader. What was Taim up
to, creating new ranks? The important thing was that the man made
weapons. The important thing was that the weapons stayed sane long
enough to be used. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t expect you to waste time
questioning my orders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you command, my Lord Dragon,&rdquo; Gedwyn muttered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send men out immediately.&rdquo; With a curt salute, fist to
chest, he strode out into the storm. The deluge bent away from him,
sheeting down the small shield he wove around himself. Rand
wondered whether the man suspected how close he had come to dying
when he seized <em>saidin</em> without warning.</p>

<p><em>You must kill him before he kills you</em>, Lews
Therin giggled. <em>They will, you know. Dead men can&rsquo;t betray
anyone</em>. The voice in Rand&rsquo;s head turned wondering. <em>
But sometimes they don&rsquo;t die. Am I dead? Are you?</em></p>

<p>Rand pushed the words down to a fly&rsquo;s buzzing,
just on the edge of notice. Since his reappearance inside
Rand&rsquo;s head, Lews Therin seldom went silent unless forced. The
man seemed madder than ever most of the time, and usually angrier
as well. Stronger sometimes, too. That voice invaded Rand&rsquo;s
dreams, and when he saw himself in a dream, it was not always
himself at all that he saw. It was not always Lews Therin, either,
the face he had come to recognize as Lews Therin&rsquo;s. Sometimes
it was blurred, yet vaguely familiar, and Lews Therin seemed
startled by it, too. That was an indication how far the man&rsquo;s
madness went. Or maybe his own.</p>

<p><em>Not yet</em>, Rand thought. <em>I can&rsquo;t
afford to go mad yet</em>.</p>

<p><em>When, then?</em> Lews Therin whispered before
Rand could mute him again.</p>

<p>With the arrival of Gedwyn and the Asha&rsquo;man, his
plan to sweep the Seanchan westward got under way. Got under way,
and crept forward as slowly as a man laboring along one of those
mired roads. He shifted his own camp at once, making no effort to
hide his movements. There was little point to straining for
secrecy. Word traveled slowly by pigeon, and far slower by courier,
once the cemaros came, yet he had no doubts he was watched, by the
White Tower, by the Forsaken, by anyone who saw gain or loss in
where the Dragon Reborn went and could afford to slip coin to a
soldier. Maybe even by the Seanchan. If he could scout them, why
not they him? But not even the Asha&rsquo;man knew why he was
moving.</p>

<p>While Rand was idly watching men fold his tent onto a
high-wheeled cart, Weiramon appeared on one of his many horses, a
prancing white gelding of the finest Tairen bloodstock. The rain
had cleared, though gray clouds still veiled the noonday sun and
the air felt as if you could squeeze water out of it with your
hands. The Dragon Banner and the Banner of Light hung limp and
sodden on their tall staffs.</p>

<p>Tairen Defenders had replaced the Companions, and as
Weiramon rode through their mounted ring, he frowned at Rodrivar
Tihera, a lean fellow, dark even for a Tairen, with a short beard
trimmed to a very sharp point. A very minor noble who had had to
rise through his abilities, Tihera was punctilious in the extreme.
The fat white plumes bobbing on his rimmed helmet added
embellishment to the elaborate bow he gave Weiramon. The High
Lord&rsquo;s frown deepened.</p>

<p>There was no need for the Captain of the Stone to be
personally in charge of Rand&rsquo;s bodyguard, but he frequently
was, just as Marcolin often commanded the Companions himself. An
often bitter rivalry had grown up between Defenders and Companions,
centering on who should guard Rand. The Tairens claimed the right
because he had ruled longer in Tear, the Illianers because he was,
after all, King of Illian. Perhaps Weiramon had heard some of the
mutters among the Defenders that it was time Tear had a king of its
own, and who better than the man who had taken the Stone? Weiramon
more than agreed with the need, but not with the choice of who
should wear the crown. He was not the only one.</p>

<p>The man smoothed his features as soon as he saw Rand
looking, and swung down from his gold-tooled saddle to offer a bow
that made Tihera&rsquo;s seem simple. Iron-spined as he was, he
could puff up and strut in his sleep. Though he did grimace
slightly at putting his polished boot into the mud. He wore a rain
cape, to keep the mist off his fine clothes, but even that was
encrusted with gold embroidery and had a collar of sapphires. For
all of Rand&rsquo;s coat of deep green silk, with golden bees
climbing the sleeves and lapels, anyone might have been forgiven
for thinking the Crown of Swords belonged on the other&rsquo;s head,
not his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord Dragon,&rdquo; Weiramon intoned. &ldquo;I cannot express
how happy I am to see you guarded by Tairens, my Lord Dragon.
Surely the world would weep if anything untoward happened.&rdquo; He was
too intelligent to come out and call the Companions untrustworthy.
By a hair, he was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sooner or later it would,&rdquo; Rand said dryly. After a
good part of it finished celebrating. &ldquo;I know how hard you&rsquo;d
cry, Weiramon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fellow actually preened, stroking the point of
his gray-streaked beard. He heard what he wanted to hear. &ldquo;Yes, my
Lord Dragon, you can be assured of my constancy. Which is why
I&rsquo;m concerned by the orders your man brought me this morning.&rdquo;
That was Adley; many of the nobles thought pretending the
Asha&rsquo;man were merely Rand&rsquo;s servants would somehow make
them less dangerous. &ldquo;Wise of you to send away most of the
Cairhienin. And the Illianers, of course; that goes without saying.
I can even understand why you limit Gueyam and the others.&rdquo;
Weiramon&rsquo;s boots squelched in the mud as he stepped nearer,
and his voice took on a confiding tone. &ldquo;I do believe some of them&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t say <em>plotted</em> against you, but I
think perhaps their loyalty has not always been without question.
As mine is. Without question.&rdquo; His voice shifted again, to strong
and confident, a man concerned only with the needs of the one he
served. The one who surely would make <em>him</em> the first King
of Tear. &ldquo;Allow me to bring all of my armsmen, my Lord Dragon. With
them, and the Defenders, I can assure the honor of the Lord of the
Morning, and his safety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In all of the individual camps across the heath,
wagons and carts were being loaded, horses saddled. Most tents were
already down. The High Lady Rosana was riding north, her banner
heading a column large enough to raise havoc among the bandits and
at least give the Shaido pause. But not enough to plant notions in
her head, especially not when half were Gueyam&rsquo;s and
Maraconn&rsquo;s retainers mixed with Defenders of the Stone. Much
the same applied to Spiron Narettin, riding eastward over the tall
ridge with as many Companions and men sworn to others of the
Council of Nine as his own liegemen, not to mention a hundred more
tailing behind on foot, some of the fellows who had surrendered in
the woods beyond that ridge the day before. A surprising number had
chosen to follow the Dragon Reborn, but Rand did not trust them
enough to leave them together. Tolmeran was just starting south
with the same kind of blend, and others would be marching off as
soon as they had their carts and wagons loaded. Each in a different
direction, and none able to trust the men at their backs far enough
for them to do more than follow the orders Rand had given. Bringing
peace to Illian was an important task, yet every last lord and lady
regretted being sent away from the Dragon Reborn, plainly wondering
whether it meant they had slipped in his trust. Though a few might
have considered why he chose to keep those he did under his eye.
Rosana had certainly looked thoughtful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your concern touches me,&rdquo; Rand told Weiramon, &ldquo;but
how many bodyguards does one man need? I&rsquo;m not off to start a
war.&rdquo; A fine point, perhaps, yet this war was well under way. It
had begun at Falme, if not before. &ldquo;Get your people ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>How many have died for my pride?</em> Lews Therin
moaned. <em>How many have died for my mistakes?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;May I at least ask <em>where</em> we are going?&rdquo;
Weiramon&rsquo;s question, not quite exasperated, came right atop
the voice in Rand&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The City,&rdquo; Rand snapped. He did not know how many
had died for his mistakes, but none for his pride. He was sure of
that.</p>

<p>Weiramon opened his mouth, plainly confused as to
whether he meant Tear or Illian, or maybe even Cairhien, but Rand
gestured him away with the Dragon Scepter, a sharp stabbing motion
that made the green-and-white tassel swing. He half wished he could
stab Lews Therin with it. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t intend to sit here all day,
Weiramon! Go to your men!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Less than an hour later he took hold of the True
Source and prepared to make a gateway for Traveling. He had to
fight the dizziness that gripped him lately whenever he seized or
loosed the Power; he did not quite sway in Tai&rsquo;daishar&rsquo;s
saddle. What with the molten filth floating on <em>saidin</em>, the
frozen slime, touching the Source came close to emptying his
stomach. Seeing double, even for only a few moments, made weaving
flows difficult if not impossible, and he could have told Dashiva
or Flinn or one of the others to do it, but Gedwyn and Rochaid were
holding their horses&rsquo; reins in front of a dozen or so
black-coated Soldiers, all who had not been out to search. Just
standing there patiently. And watching Rand. Rochaid, no more than
a hand shorter than Rand and maybe two years younger, was also full
Asha&rsquo;man, and his coat, too, was silk. A small smile played on
his face, as if he knew things others did not and was amused. What
did he know? About the Seanchan, surely, if not Rand&rsquo;s plans
for them. What else? Maybe nothing, but Rand was not about to show
any weakness in front of that pair. The dizziness faded quickly,
the twinned sight a little more slowly, as it always did, these
last few weeks, and he completed the weave, then, without waiting,
dug in his heels and rode through the opening that unfolded before
him.</p>

<p>The City he had meant was Illian, though the gateway
opened to the north of that city. Despite Weiramon&rsquo;s supposed
concerns, he hardly went unprotected and alone. Nearly three
thousand men rode through that tall square hole in the air, into
rolling meadowland not far from the broad muddy road that led down
to the Causeway of the Northern Star. Even when every lord had only
been allowed a handful of armsmen&mdash;to men accustomed to
leading a thousand if not thousands, a hundred or so were a handful&mdash;they added up. Tairens and Cairhienin and Illianers,
Defenders of the Stone under Tihera and Companions under Marcolin,
Asha&rsquo;man heeling Gedwyn. The Asha&rsquo;man who had come with
him, anyway. Dashiva and Flinn and the rest kept their horses close
behind Rand. All but Narishma. Narishma had not come back yet. The
man knew where to find him, but Rand did not like it.</p>

<p>Each kind kept to themselves as much as possible.
Gueyam and Maraconn and Aracome rode with Weiramon, all eyeing Rand
more than where they were going, and Gregorin Panar with three
others of the Council of Nine, leaning in their saddles to speak
softly and uneasily among themselves. Semaradrid, with a knot of
tight-faced Cairhienin lords behind him, watched Rand almost as
closely as the Tairens did. Rand had chosen those who came with him
as carefully as those he sent away, not always for the reasons
others might have used.</p>

<p>Had there been any onlookers, it would have been a
brave display, with all their bright banners and pennants, and
small <em>con</em> rising from some of the Cairhienin&rsquo;s backs.
Bright and brave and very dangerous. Some <em>had</em> plotted
against him, and he had learned that Semaradrid&rsquo;s House
Maravin had old alliances with House Riatin, which stood in open
rebellion against him in Cairhien. Semaradrid did not deny the
connection, but he had not mentioned it before Rand heard, either.
The Council of Nine were just too new to him to risk leaving them
all behind. And Weiramon was a fool. Left to his own devices, he
might well try to gain the Lord Dragon&rsquo;s favor by marching an
army against the Seanchan, or Murandy, or the Light alone knew who
or where. Too stupid to leave behind, too powerful to shove aside,
so he rode with Rand and thought himself honored. It was almost a
pity he was not stupid enough to do something that would get him
executed.</p>

<p>Behind came the servants and carts&mdash;no one
understood why Rand had sent all of the wagons with the others, and
he was not about to explain; who owned the next pair of ears that
would hear?&mdash;and then the long strings of spare mounts led by
horse handlers, and straggling files of men in battered
breastplates that did not quite fit or leather jerkins sewn with
rusty steel discs, carrying bows or crossbows or spears, and even a
few pikes; more of the fellows who had obeyed &ldquo;Lord Brend&rsquo;s&rdquo;
summons and decided against going home unarmed. Their leader was
the runny-nosed man Rand had spoken to on the edge of the woods,
Eagan Padros by name and much brighter than he looked. It was
difficult for a commoner to rise very far, most places, but Rand
had marked Padros out. The fellow gathered his men off to one side,
but the whole lot of them milled about, elbowing one another aside
for a better view southward.</p>

<p>The Causeway of the Northern Star stretched
arrow-straight through the miles of brown marsh that surrounded
Illian, a wide road of hard-packed dirt broken by flat stone
bridges. A wind from the south carried sea salt and a hint of
tanneries. Illian was a sprawling city, easily as large as Caemlyn
or Cairhien. Brightly colored roof tiles and hundreds of thrusting
towers, gleaming in the sun, were just visible across that sea of
grass where long-legged cranes waded and flocks of white birds flew
low uttering shrill cries. Illian had never needed walls. Not that
walls would have done the City any good against him.</p>

<p>There was considerable disappointment that he did not
mean to enter Illian, though no one spoke a complaint, at least not
where he could hear. Still, there were plenty of glum faces and
sour mutters as hasty camps began going up. Like most of the great
cities, Illian had a name for exotic mystery, free-handed tapsters,
and willing women. At least among men who had never been there,
even when it was their own capital. Ignorance always inflated a
city&rsquo;s reputation for such things. As it was, only Morr
galloped off across the causeway. Men straightened from hammering
tent pegs or setting picket lines for the horses, and followed him
with jealous eyes. Nobles watched curiously, while trying to
pretend they were not.</p>

<p>The Asha&rsquo;man with Gedwyn paid Morr no mind as
they made their own camp, which consisted of a pitch-black tent for
Gedwyn and Rochaid and a space where damp brown grass and mud were
squeezed flat and dry, for the rest to sleep wrapped in their
cloaks. That was done with the Power, of course; they did
everything with the Power, not even bothering to build cook fires.
A few in the other camps stared at them, wide-eyed, as the tent
seemed to spring up of its own accord and hampers floated away from
packsaddles, but most looked anywhere else at all once they
realized what was going on. Two or three of the black-coated
Soldiers appeared to be talking to themselves.</p>

<p>Flinn and the others did not join Gedwyn&rsquo;s lot&mdash;they had a pair of tents that went up not far from
Rand&rsquo;s&mdash;but Dashiva wandered over to where the &ldquo;Storm
Leader&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Attack Leader&rdquo; were standing at their ease, and
occasionally issuing a sharp order. A few words, and he wandered
back shaking his head and muttering angrily under his breath.
Gedwyn and Rochaid were not a friendly pair. As well they were
not.</p>

<p>Rand took to his tent as soon as it was pitched, and
sprawled fully clothed on his cot, staring at the sloped ceiling.
There were bees embroidered on the inside as well, on a false roof
made of silk. Hopwil brought a steaming pewter mug of mulled wine&mdash;Rand had left his servants behind&mdash;but the wine grew
cold on his writing table. His mind worked feverishly. Two or three
more days, and the Seanchan would have been dealt a blow that
knocked them on their heels. Then it was back to Cairhien to see
how negotiations with the Sea Folk had gone, to learn what Cadsuane
was after&mdash;he owed her a debt, but she was after something!&mdash;maybe to put a final end to what remained of the rebellion
there. Had Caraline Damodred and Darlin Sisnera slipped away in the
confusion? The High Lord Darlin in his hands might finish the
rebellion in Tear, as well. Andor. If Mat and Elayne were in
Murandy, the way it appeared, it would be weeks more at best before
Elayne could claim the Lion Throne. Once that happened, he would
have to stay clear of Caemlyn. But he had to talk to Nynaeve. <em>
Could</em> he cleanse <em>saidin</em>? It might work. It might
destroy the world, too. Lews Therin gibbered at him in stark
terror. Light, where <em>was</em> Narishma?</p>

<p>A cemaros storm swept in, all the fiercer this near
the sea. Rain beat his tent like a drum. Lightning flashes filled
the entrance with blue-white light, and thunder rumbled, the sound
like mountains tumbling across the land.</p>

<p>Out of that, Narishma stepped into the tent, dripping
wet, dark hair plastered to his head. His orders had been to avoid
notice at all cost. No flaunting for him. His sodden coat was plain
brown, and his dark hair was tied back, not braided. Even without
bells, near waist-length hair on a man attracted eyes. He wore a
scowl, too, and under his arm he carried a cylindrical bundle tied
with cord, fatter than a man&rsquo;s leg, like a small carpet.</p>

<p>Springing from the cot, Rand snatched the bundle
before Narishma could proffer it. &ldquo;Did anyone see you?&rdquo; he
demanded. &ldquo;What took you so long? I expected you last night!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It took a while to figure out what I had to do,&rdquo;
Narishma replied in a flat voice. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t tell me
everything. You nearly killed me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was ridiculous. Rand <em>had</em> told him
everything he needed to know. He was sure of it. There was no point
to trusting the man as far as he had, only to have him die and ruin
everything. Carefully he tucked the bundle beneath his cot. His
hands trembled with the urge to strip the wrappings away, to make
sure they held what Narishma had been sent for. The man would not
have dared return if they did not. &ldquo;Get yourself into a proper coat
before you join the others,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And Narishma&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Rand
straightened, fixing the other man with a steady gaze. &ldquo;You tell
anyone about this, and I <em>will</em> kill you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Kill the whole world</em>, Lews Therin laughed, a
moan of derision. Of despair. <em>I killed the world, and you can,
too, if you try hard</em>.</p>

<p>Narishma struck himself hard on the chest with his
fist. &ldquo;As you command, my Lord Dragon,&rdquo; he said sourly.</p>

<p>Bright and early the next morning, a thousand men of
the Legion of the Dragon marched out of Illian, across the Causeway
of the Northern Star, stepping to the steady beat of drums. Well,
it was early, anyway. Thick gray clouds roiled across the sky, and
a stiff sea breeze sharp with salt whipped cloaks and banners,
muttering of another storm on the way. The Legion attracted a good
bit of attention from the armsmen already in the camp, with their
blue-painted Andoran helmets and their long blue coats worked on
the chest with a red-and-gold Dragon. A blue pennant bearing the
Dragon and a number marked each of the five companies. The
Legionmen were different in many ways. For instance, they wore
breastplates, but beneath their coats, so as not to hide the
Dragons&mdash;the same reason the coats buttoned up one side&mdash;and every man carried a short-sword at his hip and a
steel-armed crossbow, every one shouldered exactly the same as
every other. The officers walked, each with a tall red plume on his
helmet, just ahead of drum and pennant. The only horses were
Morr&rsquo;s mouse-colored gelding, at their head, and pack animals
at the rear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Foot,&rdquo; Weiramon muttered, slapping his reins on a
gauntleted hand. &ldquo;Burn my soul, they&rsquo;re no good, foot.
They&rsquo;ll scatter at the first charge. Before.&rdquo; The first of the
column strode off the causeway. They had helped take Illian, and
they had not scattered.</p>

<p>Semaradrid shook his head. &ldquo;No pikes,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;I have seen well-led foot hold, with pikes, but without&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He
made a sound of disgust in his throat.</p>

<p>Gregorin Panar, the third man sitting his saddle near
Rand to watch the new arrivals, said nothing. Perhaps he had no
prejudice against infantry&mdash;though if he did not, he would be
one of only a handful of noblemen Rand had met without it&mdash;but he tried hard not to frown and almost succeeded. Everyone knew
by now that the men with the Dragon on their chests bore arms
because they had chosen to follow Rand, chosen to follow the Dragon
Reborn, for no other reason than that they wanted to. The Illianer
had to be wondering where they were going that Rand wanted the
Legion and the Council of Nine was not trusted to know. For that
matter, Semaradrid eyed Rand sideways. Only Weiramon was too stupid
to think.</p>

<p>Rand turned Tai&rsquo;daishar away. Narishma&rsquo;s
package had been rewrapped, into a thinner bundle, and tied beneath
his left stirrup leather. &ldquo;Strike the camp; we&rsquo;re moving,&rdquo; he
told the three nobles.</p>

<p>This time, he let Dashiva weave the gateway to take
them all away. The plain-faced fellow frowned at him and mumbled to
himself&mdash;Dashiva actually seemed affronted, for some reason!&mdash;and Gedwyn and Rochaid, their horses shoulder-by-shoulder,
watched with sardonic smiles as the silvery slash of light rotated
into a hole in nothing. Watched Rand more than Dashiva. Well, let
them watch. How often could he seize <em>saidin</em> and risk
falling dizzily on his face before he really did fall? It could not
be where they could see.</p>

<p>This time, the gateway took them to a wide road
carved through the low, brushy foothills of mountains to the west.
The Nemarellin Mountains. Not the equals of the Mountain of Mist,
and not a patch on the Spine of the World, but they rose dark and
severe against the sky, sharp peaks that walled the west coast of
Illian. Beyond them lay Kabal Deep, and beyond that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Men began to recognize the peaks soon enough.
Gregorin Panar took one look around and nodded in sudden
satisfaction. The other three Councilors and Marcolin reined close
to him to talk while horsemen were still pouring through the
gateway. Semaradrid required only a bit longer to puzzle it out,
and Tihera, and they also looked as if they understood now.</p>

<p>The Silver Road ran from the City to Lugard, and
carried all of the inland trade for the west. There was a Gold
Road, too, that led to Far Madding. Roads and names alike dated
from before there had been an Illian. Centuries of wagon wheels,
hooves and boots had beaten them hard, and the cemaros could only
skim them with mud. They were among the few reliable highways in
Illian for moving large groups of men in winter. Everyone knew
about the Seanchan in Ebou Dar by this time, though a good many of
the tales Rand had heard among the armsmen made the invaders seem
Trollocs&rsquo; meaner cousins. If the Seanchan intended to strike
into Illian, the Silver Road was a good place to gather for
defense.</p>

<p>Semaradrid and the others thought they knew what he
planned: he must have learned that the Seanchan were coming, and
the Asha&rsquo;man were there to destroy them when they did. Given
the stories about the Seanchan, no one seemed too upset that that
left little for them to do. Of course, Weiramon had to have it
explained to him finally, by Tihera, and he <em>was</em> upset,
though he tried to mask it behind a grand speech about the wisdom
of the Lord Dragon and the military genius of the Lord of the
Morning, along with how he, personally, would lead the first charge
against these Seanchan. A pure bull-goose fool. With luck, anyone
else who learned of a gathering on the Silver Road would at least
not be too much brighter than Semaradrid or Gregorin. With luck, no
one who mattered would learn before it was too late.</p>

<p>Settling in to wait, Rand thought it would only be
another day or so, but as the days stretched out, he began to
wonder whether he might be nearly as big a fool as Weiramon.</p>

<p>Most of the Asha&rsquo;man were out searching across
Illian and Tear and the Plains of Maredo for the rest of those Rand
wanted. Searching through the cemaros. Gateways and Traveling were
all very well, but even Asha&rsquo;man took time to find who they
sought when downpours hid anything fifty paces away and quagmires
dragged rumor to a near halt. Searching Asha&rsquo;man passed within
a mile of their quarry in ignorance, and turned only to learn the
men had moved on again. Some had farther to go, seeking people not
necessarily eager to be found. Days passed before the first brought
news.</p>

<p>The High Lord Sunamon joined Weiramon, a fat man with
an unctuous manner&mdash;toward Rand, at least. Smooth in his fine
silk coat, always smiling, he was voluble in his declarations of
loyalty, but he had plotted against Rand so long that he probably
did so in his sleep. The High Lord Torean came, with his lumpy
farmer&rsquo;s face and his vast wealth, stammering about the honor
of riding once more at the Lord Dragon&rsquo;s side. Gold concerned
Torean more than anything else, except possibly the privileges Rand
had taken away from the nobles in Tear. He seemed particularly
dismayed to learn there were no serving girls in the camp, and not
so much as a village nearby where compliant farmgirls might be
found. Torean had schemed against Rand every bit as often as
Sunamon. Maybe even more than Gueyam, or Maraconn, or Aracome.</p>

<p>There were others. There was Bertome Saighan, a
short, ruggedly handsome man with the front of his head shaved. He
supposedly did not mourn the death of his cousin Colavaere too
greatly, both because that made him the new High Seat of House
Saighan and because rumor said Rand had executed her. Or murdered
her. Bertome bowed and smiled, and his smile never reached his dark
eyes. Some said he had been very fond of his cousin. Ailil Riatin
came, a slim dignified woman with big dark eyes, not young but
quite pretty, protesting that she had a Lance-captain to lead her
armsmen and no desire to take the field in person. Protesting her
loyalty for the Lord Dragon, too. But her brother Toram claimed the
throne Rand meant for Elayne, and it was whispered that she would
do anything for Toram, anything at all. Even join with his enemies;
to hamper or to spy or both, of course. Dalthanes Annallin came,
and Amondrid Osiellin, and Doressin Chuliandred, lords who had
supported Colavaere&rsquo;s seizure of the Sun Throne when they
thought Rand would never return to Cairhien.</p>

<p>Cairhienin and Tairen, they were brought in one by
one, with fifty retainers, or at most a hundred. Men and women he
trusted even less than he did Gregorin or Semaradrid. Most were
men, not because he thought the women any less dangerous&mdash;he
was not <em>that</em> big a fool; a woman would kill you twice as fast as a
man, and usually for half the reason!&mdash;but because he could
not bring himself to take any woman except the most dangerous,
where he was going. Ailil could smile warmly while she calculated
where to plant the knife in your ribs. Anaiyella, a willowy
simpering High Lady who gave a fair imitation of a beautiful
goosebrain, had returned to Tear from Cairhien and openly begun
talking of herself for the as-yet-nonexistent throne of Tear.
Perhaps she <em>was</em> a fool, but she had managed to gain a
great deal of support, both among nobles and in the streets.</p>

<p>So he gathered them in, all the folk who had been too
long out from under his eye. He could not watch all of them all the
time, but he could not afford to let them forget that he <em>
did</em> watch sometimes. He gathered them, and he waited. For two
days. Gnashing his teeth, he waited. Five days. Eight.</p>

<p>Rain was beating a diminishing drum on his tent when
the last man he was waiting for finally arrived.</p>

<p>Shaking a small torrent from his oiled-cloth cape,
Davram Bashere blew out his thick, gray-streaked mustaches in
disgust and tossed the cape over a barrel chair. A short man with a
great hooked beak of a nose, he seemed larger than he was. Not
because he strutted, but because he assumed that he was as tall as
any man present, and other men took him so. Wise men did. The
wolf-headed ivory baton of the Marshal-General of Saldaea, tucked
carelessly behind his sword belt, had been earned on scores of
battlefields and at as many council tables. He was one of the very
few men Rand would trust with his life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t like explaining,&rdquo; Bashere
muttered, &ldquo;but I could use a little illumination.&rdquo; Adjusting his
serpentine sword, he sprawled in another chair and flung a leg over
the arm of it. He always seemed at his ease, but he could uncoil
faster than a whip. &ldquo;That Asha&rsquo;man fellow wouldn&rsquo;t say
more than you needed me yesterday, yet he said not to bring more
than a thousand men. I only had half that with me, but I brought
them. It can&rsquo;t be a battle. Half the sigils I saw out there
belong to men who&rsquo;d bite their tongues if they saw a fellow
behind you with a knife, and most of the rest to men who&rsquo;d try
to hold your attention. If they hadn&rsquo;t paid the knife man in
the first place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seated behind his writing table in his shirtsleeves,
Rand wearily pressed the heels of his palms against his eyes. With
Boreane Carivin left behind, the lamp wicks needed proper trimming,
and a faint haze of smoke hung in the air. Besides, he had been
awake most of the night poring over the maps scattered across the
table. Maps of southern Altara. No two agreed on very much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to fight a battle,&rdquo; he told
Bashere, &ldquo;who better to pay the butcher&rsquo;s bill than men who
want you dead? Anyway, it isn&rsquo;t soldiers who&rsquo;ll win this
battle. All they have to do is keep anybody from sneaking up on the
Asha&rsquo;man. What do you think of that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bashere snorted so hard that his heavy mustaches
stirred. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a deadly stew, is what I think.
Somebody&rsquo;s going to choke to death on it. The Light send it
isn&rsquo;t us.&rdquo; And then he laughed as if that were a fine
joke.</p>

<p>Lews Therin laughed, too.</p>
