<h4><em>Floating Like Snow</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
northern horizon was purple with the fierce rain
that had hammered the east of Illian through the night. Overhead, a
morning sky of dark boiling clouds threatened, and strong winds
flung cloaks about, made banners snap and crack like whips on the
crest of the ridge, the white Dragon Banner and the crimson Banner
of Light, and the bright standards of nobility from Illian and
Cairhien and Tear. The nobles kept to their own kind, three widely
spaced knots awash in gilt and silver-plated steel, silks and
velvets and laces, but in common they looked around uneasily. Even
the best-trained of their horses tossed heads and stamped hooves on
the muddy ground. The wind was cold, and colder seeming for the
heat it had replaced so abruptly, just as the rain had been a shock
after so long without. From whatever nation, they had prayed for
the baking drought to break, but none knew what to make of
unrelenting storms in answer to their prayers. Some glanced at Rand
when they thought he would not notice. Perhaps wondering if <em>
he</em> had answered them so. The thought made him laugh softly,
bitterly.</p>

<p>He patted his black gelding&rsquo;s neck with a
leather-gauntleted hand, glad that Tai&rsquo;daishar did not show
nerves. The massive animal might have been a statue, awaiting the
pressure of reins or knees to move. It was good that the Dragon
Reborn&rsquo;s horse seemed as cold as he did, as though they
floated in the Void together. Even with the One Power raging
through him, fire and ice and death, he was barely aware of the
wind, though it flailed his gold-embroidered cloak about and cut
through his coat, green silk thickly worked with gold and not
intended for wear in such weather. The wounds in his side ached and
throbbed, the old and the new cutting across it, the wounds that
would never heal, but that was distant, too, another man&rsquo;s
flesh. The Crown of Swords might have been pricking someone
else&rsquo;s temples with the sharp points of the tiny blades among
its golden laurel leaves. Even the filth woven through <em>
saidin</em> seemed less obtrusive than it once had; still vile,
still loathsome, but no longer worth notice. The nobles&rsquo; eyes
on his back were palpable, though.</p>

<p>Shifting his sword hilt, he leaned forward. He could
see the tight cluster of low, wooded hills half a mile to the east
as clearly as if he were using a looking glass. The land was flat,
here, the only prominences those forested hills and this long
ridge, thrusting up from the heath. The next thicket dense enough
to truly deserve the name lay close to ten miles off. Only
storm-battered half-leafless trees and tangles of undergrowth were
visible on the hills, but he knew what they hid. Two, perhaps three
thousand of the men Sammael had gathered to try to stop him from
taking Illian.</p>

<p>That army had disintegrated once they learned that
the man who had summoned them was dead, that Mattin Stepaneos had
vanished, perhaps into the grave as well, and that there was a new
king in Illian. Many had scattered back to their homes, yet just as
many clung together. Usually no more than twenty here, thirty
there, but a great army if they came together again, and countless
armed bands otherwise. Either way, they could not be allowed to
roam the countryside. Time weighed down on his shoulders like lead.
There was never enough time, but maybe this once&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Fire and ice
and death.</p>

<p><em>What would you do?</em> he thought. <em>Are you
there?</em> And then, doubtfully, hating the doubt, <em>Were you
ever there?</em> Silence answered, deep and dead in the emptiness
that surrounded him. Or was there mad laughter somewhere in the
recesses of his mind? Did he imagine it, like the feel of someone looking
over his shoulder, someone just on the brink of touching his back?
Or the colors that swirled just out of sight, more than colors, and
were gone? A thing of madmen. His gloved thumb slid along the
carvings that serpentined the Dragon Scepter. The long
green-and-white tassels below the polished spearpoint fluttered in
the wind. Fire and ice, and death would come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go talk to them myself,&rdquo; he announced. Which
produced a furor.</p>

<p>Lord Gregorin, the green sash of the Council of Nine
slanted across his ornately gilded breastplate, hurried his
fine-ankled white gelding forward from the Illianers, followed
closely by Demetre Marcolin, First Captain of the Companions, on a
solid bay. Marcolin was the only man among them without silk or a
speck of lace, the only man in plain if brightly burnished armor,
though the conical helmet resting on his saddle&rsquo;s high pommel
did bear three thin golden plumes. Lord Marac lifted his reins,
then let them fall uncertainly when he saw no others of the Nine
move. A wide man with a stolid manner, and new to the Council, he
often seemed more craftsman than lord despite the rich silks
beneath his lavish armor and the falls of lace spilling over. High
Lords Weiramon and Tolmeran spurred together from the Tairens, as
crusted with gold and silver as any of the Nine, and Rosana, newly
raised to High Lady and wearing a breastplate worked with the
Hawk-and-Stars of her House. There, too, others half made as if to
follow then hung back, looking worried. Blade-slender Aracome and
blue-eyed Maraconn and bald-headed Gueyam were dead men; they did
not know that, but however much they wanted to be at the center of
power, they feared Rand would kill them. Only Lord Semaradrid came
from the Cairhienin, on a gray that had seen better days, his armor
battered, its gilding chipped. His face was gaunt and hard, the
front of his head shaved and powdered like a common soldier, and
his dark eyes shone with contempt for the taller Tairens.</p>

<p>There was plenty of contempt to go around. Tairens
and Cairhienin hated one another. Illianers and Tairens despised
each other. Only Cairhienin and Illianers got along to any degree,
and there was a certain amount of prickle even there. Their two
nations might not have near the long history of bad blood shared by
Tear and Illian, yet the Cairhienin still were foreigners, armed
and armored on Illian&rsquo;s soil, welcomed halfheartedly at best
and only that much because they followed Rand. But despite all the
frowning and bristling and trying to talk at once as they milled
about Rand in a flurry of windblown cloaks, they had a common goal
now. After a fashion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Majesty,&rdquo; Gregorin said hastily, bowing in his
gold-tooled saddle, &ldquo;I do beg you let me go in your stead, or First
Captain Marcolin.&rdquo; The square-cut beard that left his upper lip
bare framed a round face creased with worry. &ldquo;These men must know
you are King&mdash;the proclamations do be read in every village,
at every crossroads, as we do speak&mdash;yet they may no show
proper respect for your crown.&rdquo; Lantern-jawed Marcolin,
clean-shaven, studied Rand with dark, deep-set eyes, giving no hint
what lay behind his impassive face. The Companions&rsquo; loyalty
was to the crown of Illian, and Marcolin was old enough to remember
when Tam al&rsquo;Thor had been Second Captain over him, but only
he knew what he thought of Rand al&rsquo;Thor as King.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord Dragon,&rdquo; Weiramon intoned as he made his
bow, not waiting for Gregorin to finish. The man always intoned,
and even on horseback he seemed to strut. His worked velvets and
striped silks and falls of lace almost overwhelmed his armor, and
his pointed gray beard gave off a flowery scent of perfumed oils.
&ldquo;This rabble is too petty to concern the Lord Dragon personally.
Set dogs to catch dogs, I say. Let the Illianers root them out.
Burn my soul, they&rsquo;ve done nothing so far to serve you but
talk.&rdquo; Trust him to turn agreement with Gregorin into an insult.
Tolmeran was lean enough to make Weiramon appear bulky and somber
enough to dim the luster of his garb; he was no fool, and rival to
Weiramon besides, yet he nodded slowly in agreement. No love lost
there for Illianers, at all.</p>

<p>Semaradrid curled a lip at the Tairens but addressed
himself to Rand, cutting in hard on Weiramon&rsquo;s heels. &ldquo;This
gathering is ten times as large any other we have found so far, my
Lord Dragon.&rdquo; He cared nothing for the King of Illian, and little
enough for the Dragon Reborn, except that the throne of Cairhien
was Rand&rsquo;s to give, and Semaradrid hoped it would be given to
one he could follow instead of fight. &ldquo;Their loyalties must be to
Brend, or so many would not have held together. I fear talking to
them is a waste of time, but if you must talk, let me ring their
position openly with steel so they know the price of putting a foot
out of line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rosana glared right back at Semaradrid, a lean woman,
not tall yet nearly as tall as he, with eyes like blue ice. She did
not wait for him to finish, either, and she, too, spoke to Rand.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come too far and invested too much in you to see you die
now, for nothing,&rdquo; she said bluntly. No more a fool than Tolmeran,
Rosana had claimed a place in the councils of the High Lords,
though Tairen High Ladies seldom did, and blunt was the word for
her. Despite the armor most of the noblewomen wore, none actually
led their armsmen into battle, yet Rosana carried a flanged mace on
her saddle, and sometimes Rand thought she would like a chance to
use it. &ldquo;I doubt those Illianers lack for bows,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and it
takes only one arrow to kill even the Dragon Reborn.&rdquo; Pursing his
lips thoughtfully, Marcolin nodded before catching himself, then
exchanged startled looks with Rosana, each more surprised than the
other to find themselves of like mind with an ancient enemy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These peasants could never have found the mettle to
stay under arms without encouragement,&rdquo; Weiramon continued
smoothly, ignoring Rosana. He was skilled at ignoring who, and
what, he did not want to see or hear. He was a fool. &ldquo;May I suggest
my Lord Dragon look to these so-called Nine for the source?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do protest this Tairen pig&rsquo;s insults,
Majesty!&rdquo; Gregorin growled right atop him, one hand darting to his
sword. &ldquo;I do protest most heartily!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are too many this time,&rdquo; Semaradrid said at
the same instant. &ldquo;Most will turn against you as soon as your back
is to them in any case.&rdquo; By his pointed frown, he might have been
speaking of the Tairens as well as the men on the wooded hills.
Perhaps he was. &ldquo;Better to kill them and be done!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I ask for opinions?&rdquo; Rand snapped harshly.
Babble became silence, except for the crack of cloaks and banners
flapping in the wind. Suddenly expressionless faces regarded him,
more than one going gray. They did not know he held the Power, but
they knew him. Not all of what they knew was truth, but it was just
as well they believed. &ldquo;You will come with me, Gregorin,&rdquo; he said
in a more normal voice. Still hard, though. Steel was all they
understood; go soft, and they <em>would</em> turn on him. &ldquo;And you,
Marcolin. The rest stay here. Dashiva! Hopwil!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everyone not named reined their horses back hurriedly
as the two Asha&rsquo;man rode to join Rand, and the Illianers eyed
the black-coated men as though they would have liked to remain
behind, too. Aside from anything else, Corlan Dashiva was glowering
and muttering under his breath as he so often did. Everyone was
aware that <em>saidin</em> drove men mad sooner or later, and
plain-faced Dashiva certainly looked the part, lank untrimmed hair
flying in the wind, licking his lips and shaking his head. For that
matter, Eben Hopwil, just sixteen and still with a few scattered
blotches on his cheeks, wore a staring frown that gazed beyond
anything in sight. At least Rand knew the why of that.</p>

<p>As the Asha&rsquo;man drew near, Rand could not help
cocking his head to listen, though what he listened for was inside
his head. Alanna was there, of course; neither the Void nor the
Power altered that a whisker. Distance wore that awareness down to
just that&mdash;awareness that she existed, somewhere far to the
north&mdash;yet there was something more today, something he had
felt several times recently, dim and barely on the edge of notice.
A whisper of shock, perhaps, or outrage, a breath of something
sharp he could not quite grasp. She must feel whatever it was very
strongly for him to be even that conscious of it at this distance.
Maybe she was missing him. A wry thought. He did not miss her.
Ignoring Alanna was easier than it had been once. She was there,
but not the voice that used to shout of death and killing whenever
an Asha&rsquo;man came into sight. Lews Therin was gone. Unless that
feel of someone staring at the back of his head, brushing his
shoulder blades with a finger, was him. Was there a madman&rsquo;s
hoarse laughter deep in his thoughts? Or was it his own? The man
<em>had</em> been there! He had!</p>

<p>He became aware of Marcolin staring at him, and
Gregorin trying very hard not to. &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; he told them wryly,
and almost laughed when they clearly understood right away. Relief
was too plain on their faces for anything else. He was not insane.
Yet. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he told them, and started Tai&rsquo;daishar down the
slope at a trot. Despite the men following, he felt alone. Despite
the Power, he felt empty.</p>

<p>Between the ridge and the hills lay patches of thick
scrub and long stretches of dead grass, a glistening mat of brown
and yellow beaten flat by the rain. Only a few days ago the ground
had been so parched that he had thought it could drink a river
without changing. Then the torrents came, sent by the Creator
finding mercy at last, or maybe by the Dark One in a fit of black
humor; he did not know which. Now the horses&rsquo; hooves splashed
mud at every second step. He hoped this did not take long. He had
some time, by what Hopwil had reported, but not forever. Perhaps
weeks, if he was lucky. He needed months. Light, he needed years he
would never have!</p>

<p>His hearing heightened by the Power, he could make
out some of what the men behind him were saying. Gregorin and
Marcolin rode knee-to-knee, trying to hold their cloaks against the
wind and speaking in low tones about the men ahead, about their
fears the men might fight. Neither doubted they would be crushed if
they resisted, but they feared the effect on Rand, and his on
Illian, if Illianers fought him now that Brend was dead. They still
could not bring themselves to give Brend his true name, Sammael.
The very notion that one of the Forsaken had ruled in Illian
frightened them even more than the fact that the Dragon Reborn
ruled there now.</p>

<p>Dashiva, slumped in his gray&rsquo;s saddle like a man
who had never seen a horse before, muttered angrily under his
breath. In the Old Tongue, which he spoke and read as fluently as a
scholar. Rand knew a little, though not enough to understand what
the fellow was mumbling. Probably complaints about the weather;
despite being a farmer, Dashiva disliked being out-of-doors unless
the skies were clear.</p>

<p>Only Hopwil rode in silence, frowning at something
beyond the horizon, his hair and cloak whipping about as wildly as
Dashiva&rsquo;s. Now and then he clutched the hilt of his sword
unconsciously. Rand had to speak three times, the last sharply,
before Hopwil gave a surprised jerk and booted his lanky dun up
beside Tai&rsquo;daishar.</p>

<p>Rand studied him. The young man&mdash;not a boy any
longer, no matter his age&mdash;had filled out since Rand first
saw him, though his nose and ears still seemed made for a bigger
man. A Dragon, red-enameled gold, now balanced the silver Sword on
his high collar, just like Dashiva&rsquo;s. Once, he had said he
would laugh a year for joy when the Dragon was his, but he stared
unblinking at Rand as though looking through him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you learned was good news,&rdquo; Rand told him. Only
an effort kept him from trying to crush the Dragon Scepter in his
fist. &ldquo;You did well.&rdquo; He had expected the Seanchan to return, but
not so soon. He had hoped not so soon. And not leaping out of
nowhere, swallowing cities at a gulp. When he found out that
merchants in Illian had known for days before any of them thought
to inform the Nine&mdash;the Light forbid they should lose a
chance at profit because too many knew too much!&mdash;he had been
within a hair of scouring the city to its foundations. But the news
was good, or as good as it could be in the circumstances. Hopwil
had Traveled to Amador, to the countryside nearby, and the Seanchan
appeared to be waiting. Perhaps digesting what they had consumed.
The Light send they choked on it! He forced his grip to loosen on
the length of Dragon-carved spearhead. &ldquo;If Morr brings half as
good, I have time to settle Illian before dealing with them.&rdquo; Ebou
Dar, as well! The Light burn the Seanchan! They were a distraction,
one he did not need and could not afford to ignore.</p>

<p>Hopwil said nothing, only looked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you upset because you had to kill women?&rdquo; <em>
Desora, of the Musara Reyn, and Lamelle, of the Smoke Water
Miagoma, and</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Rand forced down the instinctive litany
even as it began floating across the Void. New names had appeared
on that list, names he did not remember adding. Laigin Arnault, a
Red sister who had died trying to take him a prisoner to Tar Valon.
Surely she had no right to a place, but she had claimed one.
Colavaere Saighan, who had hanged herself rather than accept
justice. Others. Men had died in thousands, by his order or by his
hand, but it was the faces of the women that haunted his dreams.
Each night, he made himself confront their silently accusing eyes.
Maybe it was their eyes he had felt of late.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you about <em>damane</em> and <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em>,&rdquo; he said calmly, but inside of him, rage flared,
fire spiderwebbing around the emptiness of the Void. <em>The Light
burn me, I&rsquo;ve killed more women than all your nightmares could
hold! My hands are black with the blood of women!</em> &ldquo;If you
hadn&rsquo;t wiped out that Seanchan patrol, they&rsquo;d have killed
you for sure.&rdquo; He did not say that Hopwil should have avoided them,
avoided the need to kill them. Too late for that. &ldquo;I doubt that
<em>damane</em> even knew how to shield a man. You had no choice.&rdquo;
And better they were all dead than some escaping with word of a man
who could channel, scouting them.</p>

<p>Absently, Hopwil touched his left sleeve, where the
black color disguised fire-scarred wool. The Seanchan had not died
easily or fast. &ldquo;I piled the bodies in a hollow,&rdquo; he said in a flat
voice. &ldquo;The horses, everything. I burned it all to ash. White ash
that floated in the wind like snow. It didn&rsquo;t bother me at
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand heard the lie on the man&rsquo;s tongue, but
Hopwil had to learn. After all, he had. They were what they were,
and that was all there was to it. All there was. Liah, of the
Cosaida Chareen, a name written in fire. Moiraine Damodred, another
name that seared to the soul rather than merely burning. A nameless
Darkfriend, represented only by a face, who had died by his sword
near&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Majesty,&rdquo; Gregorin said loudly, pointing ahead. A
lone man came out of the trees at the foot of the nearest hill to
stand waiting in an attitude of defiance. He carried a bow, and
wore a pointed steel cap and a belted mail shirt that hung nearly
to his knees.</p>

<p>Rand spurred Tai&rsquo;daishar to meet him seething
with the Power. <em>Saidin</em> could protect him from men.</p>

<p>Up close, the bowman did not make so brave a sight.
Rust streaked his helmet and mail, and he looked sodden, mud to his
thighs, damp hair trailing down a narrow face. Coughing hollowly,
he scrubbed at a long nose with the back of his hand. His bowstring
appeared taut, though; that, he had protected from the rain. And
the fletchings on the arrows in his quiver looked dry, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you the leader here?&rdquo; Rand demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might say I do speak for him,&rdquo; the narrow-faced
man replied warily. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; As the others galloped up behind Rand,
he shifted his feet, dark eyes like a cornered badger&rsquo;s.
Badgers were dangerous, cornered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch your tongue, man!&rdquo; Gregorin snapped. &ldquo;You do
speak to Rand al&rsquo;Thor, the Dragon Reborn, Lord of the Morning
and King of Illian! Kneel to your King! What do your name be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He do be the Dragon Reborn?&rdquo; the fellow said
doubtfully. Eyeing Rand from the crown on his head to his boots,
lingering a moment on the gilded Dragon buckling his sword belt,
the man shook his head as if he had expected someone older, or
grander. &ldquo;And Lord of the Morning, you do say? Our King did never
style himself so.&rdquo; He made no move toward kneeling, or giving his
name. Gregorin&rsquo;s face darkened at the man&rsquo;s tone, and
maybe at the man&rsquo;s oblique denial of Rand as King. Marcolin
gave a slight nod, as though he had expected no more.</p>

<p>Damp rustlings stirred in the undergrowth among the
trees. Rand heard easily, and abruptly he felt <em>saidin</em> fill
Hopwil. No longer staring at nothing, Hopwil studied the woodline
intently, a wild light in his eyes. Dashiva, silent, raking dark
hair out of his face, looked bored. Leaning forward in his saddle,
Gregorin opened his mouth angrily. Fire and ice, but not yet
death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peace, Gregorin.&rdquo; Rand did not raise his voice, but
he wove flows to carry his words, Air and Fire, so they boomed
against the wall of trees. &ldquo;My offer is generous.&rdquo; The long-nosed
man staggered at the sound, and Gregorin&rsquo;s horse shied. Those
hidden men would hear clearly. &ldquo;Lay down your arms, and those who
want to return home, can. Those who want to follow me instead, can
do that. But no man leaves here under arms unless he <em>does</em>
follow me. I know most of you are good men, who answered the call
of your King and the Council of Nine to defend Illian, but <em>
I</em> am your King, now, and I&rsquo;ll not have anyone tempted to
turn bandit.&rdquo; Marcolin nodded grimly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about your Dragonsworn burning farms?&rdquo; a
man&rsquo;s frightened voice shouted from the trees. &ldquo;They do be
flaming bandits!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about your Aiel?&rdquo; another called. &ldquo;I do hear
they carry off whole villages!&rdquo; More voices from unseen men joined
in, all shouting the same things, Dragonsworn and Aiel, murderous
brigands and savages. Rand ground his teeth.</p>

<p>When the shouting faded, narrow-face said, &ldquo;You do
see?&rdquo; He paused to cough, then hawked and spat, maybe for his chest
and maybe for emphasis. A pitiful sight, all wet and rust, but his
backbone was as tight as his bowstring. He ignored Rand&rsquo;s
glare as easily as he did Gregorin&rsquo;s. &ldquo;You do ask us to go
home unarmed, unable to defend ourselves or our families, while
your people do burn and steal and kill. They do say the storm be
coming,&rdquo; he added, and looked surprised that he had, surprised and
confused for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Aiel you&rsquo;ve heard about are my enemies!&rdquo;
Not spider-webs of flame this time, but solid sheets of fury that
wrapped tight around the Void. Rand&rsquo;s voice was ice, though;
it roared like the crack of winter. The storm was coming? Light, he
<em>was</em> the storm! &ldquo;<em>My</em> Aiel are hunting them down. My
Aiel hunt the Shaido, and they and Davram Bashere and most of the
Companions hunt bandits, whatever they call themselves! I am the
King of Illian, and I will allow no one to disrupt the peace of
Illian!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if what you say do be true,&rdquo; narrow-face
began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is!&rdquo; Rand snapped. &ldquo;You have until midday to
decide.&rdquo; The man frowned uncertainly; unless the roiling clouds
cleared, he might have a difficult time knowing midday. Rand gave
him no relief. &ldquo;Decide wisely!&rdquo; he said. Whirling Tai&rsquo;daishar
about, he spurred the gelding to a gallop back toward the ridge
without waiting for the others.</p>

<p>Reluctantly he let go of the Power, forced himself
not to hang on like a man clutching salvation with his fingernails
as life and filth drained from him together. For an instant, he saw
double; the world seemed to tilt dizzily. That was a recent
problem, and he worried it might be part of the sickness that
killed men who channeled, but the dizziness never lasted more than
moments. It was the rest of letting go that he regretted. The world
seemed to dull. No, it did dull, and became somehow less. Colors
were washed-out, the sky smaller, compared to what they had been
before. He wanted desperately to seize the Source again and wring
the One Power out of it. Always it was so when the Power left
him.</p>

<p>No sooner had <em>saidin</em> gone, though, than rage
bubbled in its place, white-hot and searing, nearly as hot as the
Power had been. The Seanchan were not enough, and brigands hiding
behind his name? Deadly distractions he could not afford. Was
Sammael reaching out from the grave? Had he sown the Shaido to
sprout like thorns wherever Rand laid a hand? Why? The man could
not have <em>believed</em> he would die. And if half the tales Rand
heard were true, there were more in Murandy and Altara and the
Light alone knew where! Many among the Shaido already taken
prisoner had spoken of an Aes Sedai. Could the <em>White Tower</em>
be involved somehow? Would the White Tower never give him peace?
Never? Never.</p>

<p>Battling fury, he was blind to Gregorin and the rest
catching up. When they topped the ridge among the waiting nobles,
he drew rein so abruptly that Tai&rsquo;daishar reared, pawing the
air and flinging mud from his hooves. The nobles edged their mounts
back, from his gelding, from him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I gave them to midday,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Watch them. I
don&rsquo;t want this lot breaking into fifty smaller bands and
slipping away. I&rsquo;ll be in my tent.&rdquo; Except for wind-tossed
cloaks they might have been stone, rooted to one spot as if he
meant the command to watch for them personally. At that moment, he
did not care if they stayed there till they froze or melted.</p>

<p>Without another word he trotted down the back slope
of the ridge, followed by the two black-coated Asha&rsquo;man and
his Illianer banner-bearers. Fire and ice, and death was coming.
But he was steel. He was steel.</p>
