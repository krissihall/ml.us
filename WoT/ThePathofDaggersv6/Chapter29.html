<h4><em>A Cup of Sleep</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">D</span>on&rsquo;t
be an utter woolhead, Rand,&rdquo; Min said.
Making herself remain seated, she crossed her legs and kicked her
foot idly, but she could not keep exasperation out of her voice.
&ldquo;Go to her! Speak to her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;I know which letter to believe,
now. It&rsquo;s better this way. She&rsquo;s safe, now. From anyone
who wants to strike at me. Safe from me! It&rsquo;s better!&rdquo; But he
stalked up and down in his shirtsleeves between the two rows of
chairs in front of the Dragon Throne, his fists white-knuckle hard,
glaring to beat the black clouds beyond the casements that were
laying a new blanket of snow on Cairhien.</p>

<p>Min exchanged looks with Fedwin Morr, who stood by
the sun-carved doors. The Maidens now let anyone who was not an
obvious threat walk in unannounced, but those Rand did not want to
see this morning would be turned away by the husky boy. He wore the
Dragon and Sword on his black collar, and Min knew he had already
seen more battles&mdash;more horror&mdash;than most men three
times his age, yet he was a boy. Today, casting uneasy glances at
Rand, he seemed younger than ever. The sword on his hip still
looked out of place, to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Dragon Reborn is a man, Fedwin,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And
like any man, he&rsquo;s sulking because he thinks a woman
doesn&rsquo;t want to see him again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Goggling, the boy jerked as if she had goosed him.
Rand stopped to scowl at her sullenly. All that kept her from
laughing was knowing that he was hiding pain as real as any stab
wound. That, and the sure knowledge that he would be as hurt if she
had done what had been done. Not that she would ever have the
chance to rip down his banners, but the point applied. Rand had
been stunned at first by the news Taim brought from Caemlyn at
dawn, but as soon as the man left, he had stopped looking like a
poleaxed bull and started&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;This!</p>

<p>Standing, she adjusted her pale green coat, folded
her arms beneath her breasts, and confronted him directly. &ldquo;What
else can it be?&rdquo; she asked calmly. Well, she tried for calm, and
almost made it. She loved the man, but after a morning of this, she
wanted to box his ears soundly. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t mentioned Mat
twice, and you don&rsquo;t know whether <em>he&rsquo;s</em> even
alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat&rsquo;s alive,&rdquo; Rand snarled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d know if
he was dead. What do you mean I&rsquo;m&mdash;!&rdquo; His jaw clenched as
if he could not make himself say the word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sulking,&rdquo; she provided. &ldquo;Soon, you&rsquo;ll be
pouting. Some women think men are prettier when they pout. I&rsquo;m
not one of them.&rdquo; Well, enough of that. His face had darkened, and
he was not blushing. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you twisted yourself into knots
to make sure she got the throne of Andor? Which is hers by right,
might I add. Didn&rsquo;t you say you wanted her to have Andor
whole, not ripped apart like Cairhien or Tear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;And now it&rsquo;s hers, and she
wants me out of it! Good enough, I say! And don&rsquo;t tell me
again to stop shouting! I&rsquo;m not&mdash;!&rdquo; He realized that he
was, and clamped his teeth shut. A low growl came from his throat.
Morr set to studying one of his buttons, twisting it back and
forth. He had been doing a lot of that this morning.</p>

<p>Min kept her face smooth. She was <em>not</em> going
to slap him, and he was too big for her to spank. &ldquo;Andor is hers,
just as you wanted,&rdquo; she said. Calmly. Almost. &ldquo;None of the
Forsaken are going after her now she&rsquo;s torn your banners
down.&rdquo; A dangerous light appeared in those blue-gray eyes, but she
pressed on. &ldquo;Just as you wanted. And you can&rsquo;t believe
she&rsquo;s siding with your enemies. Andor will follow the Dragon
Reborn, and you know it. So the only reason for you to be in a snit
is because you think she doesn&rsquo;t want to see you. Go to her,
you fool!&rdquo; The next part was the hardest to say. &ldquo;Before you can
say two words, she&rsquo;ll be kissing you.&rdquo; Light, she loved Elayne
almost as much as she did Rand&mdash;maybe as much, in a very
different way&mdash;but how was a woman to compete with a
beautiful golden-haired queen who had a powerful nation at her beck
and call?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;angry,&rdquo; Rand said in a tight voice.
And started pacing again. Min considered kicking him square in the
bottom. Hard.</p>

<p>One of the doors opened to admit leathery
white-haired Sorilea, who brushed Morr aside even as he was looking
to see whether Rand wanted her allowed entry. Rand opened his mouth&mdash;angrily, whatever he chose to claim&mdash;and five women in
thick black robes damp with melted snow followed the Wise One into
the room, hands folded, eyes down, and deep hoods not quite hiding
their faces. Their feet were wrapped in rags.</p>

<p>Min&rsquo;s scalp prickled. To her eyes, images and
auras danced and vanished and were replaced around all six women,
just as around Rand. She had been hoping he had forgotten those
five were alive. What in the name of the Light was that wicked old
woman doing?</p>

<p>Sorilea gestured once in a clatter of gold and ivory
bracelets, and the five hastily arranged themselves in a line atop
the golden Rising Sun set in the stone floor. Rand strode along
that row, stripping back hoods, baring faces that he stared into
cold-eyed.</p>

<p>Every one of the black-robed women was unwashed, her
hair lank and dirty with sweat. Elza Penfell, a Green sister, met
his gaze eagerly, a strangely fervent look on her face. Nesune
Bihara, a slender Brown, studied him as intently as he did her.
Sarene Nemdahl, so beautiful even in her dirt that you thought her
agelessness must be natural, appeared to be holding to her White
Ajah coolness by a fingernail. Beldeine Nyram, too new to the shawl
to have the ageless features, essayed an uncertain smile that
melted under his stare. Erian Boroleos, pale and almost as lovely
as Sarene, flinched, then visibly forced herself to look into that
frigid gaze. Those last two also were Green, and all five had been
among the sisters who kidnapped him on Elaida&rsquo;s orders. Some
had been among those who tortured him while trying to carry him to
Tar Valon. Sometimes Rand still woke, sweating and panting,
mumbling about being confined, being beaten. Min hoped she did not
see murder in his stare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These were named <em>da&rsquo;tsang</em>, Rand
al&rsquo;Thor,&rdquo; Sorilea said. &ldquo;I think they feel their shame in the
bone, now. Erian Boroleos was the first to ask to be beaten as you
were, sunrise and sunset, but now each has done so. That plea has
been granted. Each has asked to serve you however she may. The <em>
toh</em> for their betrayal cannot be met,&rdquo; her voice darkened for
a moment; to the Aiel, the betrayal of the kidnapping was far worse
than what they had done after, &ldquo;yet they know their shame, and they
wish to try. We have decided to leave the choice to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min frowned. Leave the choice to him? Wise Ones
rarely left any choice they could make to anyone else. Sorilea <em>
never</em> did. The sinewy Wise One casually shifted her dark shawl
on her shoulders and watched Rand as if this was of no importance
at all. But she shot one blue ice glance at Min, and suddenly Min
was sure that if she said the wrong thing here, that bony old woman
would have her hide. It was not a viewing. She just knew Sorilea
better than she wanted to, by now.</p>

<p>Determinedly she set to studying what was appearing
and vanishing around the women. No easy task when they stood so
close together she could not be certain whether a particular image
belonged to one woman or the woman next to her. At least the auras
were always certain. Light, let her be able to understand at least
some of what she saw!</p>

<p>Rand took Sorilea&rsquo;s announcement coolly, on the
surface. He rubbed his hands together slowly, then thoughtfully
examined the herons branded on his palms. He examined each of those
Aes Sedai faces in turn. Finally, he focused on Erian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he asked her in a mild voice. &ldquo;I killed two of
your Warders. Why?&rdquo; Min winced. Rand was many things, but seldom
mild. And Erian was one of the few who had beaten him more than
once.</p>

<p>The pale Illianer sister straightened. Images danced,
and auras flashed and were gone. Nothing Min could read.
Dirty-faced and her long black hair matted, Erian gathered Aes
Sedai authority around her and met his gaze levelly. But her answer
came simply and directly. &ldquo;We did be wrong in taking you. I have
considered long on it. You must fight the Last Battle, and we must
help you. If you will no accept me, I do understand, but I will
help as you do require if you will allow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stared at her without expression.</p>

<p>He put that same one-word question to each, and their
answers were as different as the women.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Green is the Battle Ajah,&rdquo; Beldeine told him
proudly, and despite smudges on her cheeks and dark circles beneath
her eyes, she did look a Queen of Battles. But then, Saldaean women
seemed to find that second nature. &ldquo;When you go to Tarmon
Gai&rsquo;don, the Green must be there. I will follow, if you will
accept me.&rdquo; Light, she was going to bond an Asha&rsquo;man as a
Warder! How&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? No; it was not important now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What we did was logical at the time.&rdquo; Sarene&rsquo;s
tightly held cool serenity slipped into clear worry, and she shook
her head. &ldquo;I say that to explain, not to exculpate. Circumstances
have changed. For you, the logical course might seem to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She
drew a decidedly unsteady breath. Images and auras; a tempestuous
love affair, of all things! The woman was ice, however beautiful.
And there was nothing useful in knowing some man would melt her!
&ldquo;To send us back to captivity,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;or even execute us.
For me, logic says I must serve you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nesune tilted her head, and her nearly black eyes
seemed to be trying to store away every scrap of him. One
red-and-green aura spoke of honors, and fame. A huge building
appeared above her head and vanished. A library she would found. &ldquo;I
want to study you,&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;I can hardly do that carrying
stones or digging holes. They do leave plenty of time for thought,
but serving you seems a fair exchange for what I might learn.&rdquo; Rand
blinked at the directness of that, but otherwise, his expression
did not alter.</p>

<p>The most surprising answer came from Elza, in her
manner of delivery more than the words. Sinking to her knees, she
gazed up at Rand with feverish eyes. Her whole face seemed to shine
with fervor. Auras flared and images cascaded around her, telling
nothing. &ldquo;You are the Dragon Reborn,&rdquo; she said breathlessly. &ldquo;You
must be there for the Last Battle. I must help you be there!
Whatever is necessary, I will do!&rdquo; And she flung herself facedown,
pressing her lips to the polished stone floor in front of his
boots. Even Sorilea looked taken aback, and Sarene&rsquo;s mouth
dropped open. Morr gaped at her and hastily returned to twisting
his button. Min thought he giggled nervously, almost under his
breath.</p>

<p>Turning on his heel, Rand stalked halfway to the
Dragon Throne, where his scepter and the crown of Illian rested
atop his gold-embroidered red coat. His face was so bleak that Min
wanted to rush to him no matter who was watching, but she continued
to study the Aes Sedai. And Sorilea. She had never seen anything
really useful around that white-haired harridan.</p>

<p>Abruptly, Rand turned back, striding toward the line
of women so quickly that Beldeine and Sarene stepped back. A sharp
gesture from Sorilea jerked them into place again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you accept being confined in a box?&rdquo; His voice
grated, stone grinding on frozen stone. &ldquo;Locked in a chest all day,
and beaten before you go in and when you come out?&rdquo; That was what
they had done to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Elza moaned against the floor. &ldquo;Whatever I
must do, I will!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you do require it,&rdquo; Erian managed shakily, and,
faces aghast, the others nodded slowly.</p>

<p>Min stared in amazement, knotting her fists in her
coat pockets. That he might think of getting his own back in the
same manner seemed almost natural, but she had to stop it, somehow.
She knew him better than he did himself; she knew where he was hard
as a knife blade, and where he was vulnerable no matter how he
denied it. He would never forgive himself this. But how? Fury
contorted his face, and he shook his head as he did when arguing
with that voice he heard. He muttered one word aloud that she
understood. <em>Ta&rsquo;veren</em>. Sorilea stood there calmly
examining him as closely as Nesune did. Not even the threat of the
chest shook the Brown. Except for Elza, still moaning and kissing
the floor, the others were hollow-eyed, as if seeing themselves
doubled up and bound as he had been.</p>

<p>Among all of those images spilling around Rand and
the women, suddenly an aura flashed, blue and yellow tinged with
green, encompassing them all. And Min knew its meaning. She gasped,
half in surprise, half in relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will serve you, each in her fashion, Rand,&rdquo; she
said hurriedly. &ldquo;I saw it.&rdquo; <em>Sorilea</em> would serve him?
Suddenly Min wondered exactly what &ldquo;in her fashion&rdquo; meant. The
words came with the knowing, but she did not always know what the
words themselves meant. But they <em>would</em> serve; that much
was plain.</p>

<p>The fury drained from Rand&rsquo;s face as he silently
studied the Aes Sedai. Some of them glanced at Min with raised
eyebrows, obviously marveling that a few words from her carried so
much weight, but for the most part, they watched Rand and hardly
seemed to breathe. Even Elza lifted her head to gaze up at him.
Sorilea gave Min one quick look, and the faintest nod. Approving,
Min thought. So the old woman pretended not to care one way or the
other, did she?</p>

<p>At last, Rand spoke. &ldquo;You can swear to me as Kiruna
and the others did. That, or go back to wherever the Wise Ones have
been keeping you. I&rsquo;ll accept nothing less.&rdquo; Despite a hint of
demand in his voice, he looked as if he, too, did not care, arms
folded, eyes impatient. The oath he demanded of them came out in a
rush.</p>

<p>Min did not expect quibbles, not after her viewing,
yet it was still a surprise when Elza scrambled up to her knees,
and the others lowered themselves to theirs. In ragged unison, five
more Aes Sedai swore under the Light and by their hope of salvation
to serve the Dragon Reborn faithfully until the Last Battle had
come and gone. Nesune delivered the words as though examining each
one, Sarene as if stating a principle of logic, Elza wearing a
wide, victorious smile, but they all swore. How many Aes Sedai
would he gather around him?</p>

<p>With the oath, Rand seemed to lose interest. &ldquo;Find
them clothes and put them with your other &lsquo;apprentices,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
he told Sorilea absently. He was frowning, but not at her or the
Aes Sedai. &ldquo;How many do you think you&rsquo;ll end up with?&rdquo; Min
almost jumped at the echo of her own thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;However many are necessary,&rdquo; Sorilea said dryly. &ldquo;I
think more will come.&rdquo; She clapped her hands once and gestured, and
the five sisters sprang to their feet. Only Nesune looked surprised
at the alacrity with which they had obeyed. Sorilea smiled, a very
satisfied smile for an Aiel, and Min did not think it was caused by
the other women&rsquo;s obedience.</p>

<p>Nodding, Rand turned away. He was already beginning
to pace again, already beginning to scowl over Elayne. Min settled
into her chair once more, wishing she had one of Master Fel&rsquo;s
books to read. Or to throw at Rand. Well, one of Master Fel&rsquo;s
to read, and someone else&rsquo;s to throw.</p>

<p>Sorilea herded the black-clad sisters out of the
room, but at the last, she paused with one hand holding a door and
looked back at Rand striding away from her toward the gilded
throne. Her lips pursed thoughtfully. &ldquo;That woman, Cadsuane
Melaidhrin, is beneath this roof again today,&rdquo; she said at last, to
his back. &ldquo;I think she believes you are afraid of her, Rand
al&rsquo;Thor, the way you avoid her whereabouts.&rdquo; With that, she
left.</p>

<p>For a long moment, Rand stood staring at the throne.
Or maybe at something beyond it. Abruptly, he gave himself a shake
and strode the remaining distance to pick up the Crown of Swords.
On the point of setting it on his head, though, he hesitated, then
put it back. Donning the coat, he left crown and scepter where they
lay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean to find out what Cadsuane wants,&rdquo; he
announced. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t come to the palace every day because
she likes a trip through the snow. Will you come with me, Min?
Maybe you&rsquo;ll have a viewing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was on her feet faster than any of those Aes
Sedai. A visit with Cadsuane would likely be as pleasurable as a
visit with Sorilea, yet anything was better than sitting there
alone. Besides, maybe she <em>would</em> have a viewing. Fedwin
fell in behind her and Rand with an alert look in his eyes.</p>

<p>The six Maidens outside in the tall vaulted hallway
rose, but they did not follow. Somara was the only one Min knew;
she gave Min a brief smile, and Rand a flat, disapproving stare.
The others glowered. The Maidens had accepted his explanation about
why he had gone without them in the first place, so any watchers
would believe for as long as possible that he was still in
Cairhien, but they still demanded to know why he had not sent for
them afterward, and Rand had had no answers. He muttered something
under his breath, and quickened his pace so Min had to stretch her
legs to keep up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch Cadsuane carefully, Min,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And you,
too, Morr. She&rsquo;s up to some Aes Sedai scheme, but burn me if I
can see what. I don&rsquo;t know. There&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A stone wall seemed to strike Min from behind; she
thought she heard roaring, crashing. And then Rand was turning her
over&mdash;she was lying on the floor?&mdash;looking down at her
with the first fear she remembered seeing in those morning-blue
eyes. It only faded when she sat up, coughing. The air was full of
dust! And then she saw the corridor.</p>

<p>The Maidens were gone from in front of Rand&rsquo;s
doors. The doors themselves were gone, along with most of the wall,
and a jagged hole nearly as big gaped in the wall opposite. She
could see into his apartments clearly despite the dust, into
devastation. Massive piles of rubble lay everywhere, and above, the
ceiling yawned open to the sky. Snow swirled down onto flames
dancing among the rubble. One of the massive blackwood posts of his
bed stuck burning out of shattered stone, and she realized she
could see all the way outside to the stepped towers veiled by the
snowfall. It was as if a huge hammer had smashed into the Sun
Palace. And had they been in there, instead of going to see
Cadsuane&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Min shivered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; she began unsteadily, then abandoned
the useless question. Any fool would see <em>what</em> had
happened. &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; she asked instead.</p>

<p>Covered in dust, hair every which way, and with tears
in their coats, the two men looked as if they had been rolled along
the corridor, and perhaps they had. She thought they were all a
good ten paces farther from the doors than she remembered. From
where the doors had been. In the distance, anxious shouts rose,
echoing along the halls. Neither man answered her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I trust you, Morr?&rdquo; Rand asked.</p>

<p>Fedwin met his gaze openly. &ldquo;With your life, my Lord
Dragon,&rdquo; he said simply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I <em>am</em> trusting you with,&rdquo;
Rand said. His fingers brushed her cheek, and then he stood
abruptly. &ldquo;Guard her with <em>your</em> life, Morr.&rdquo; Hard as steel,
his voice. Grim as death. &ldquo;If they&rsquo;re still in the Palace,
they&rsquo;ll feel you try to make a gateway, and strike before you
can finish. Don&rsquo;t channel at all unless you must, but be
ready. Take her down to the servants&rsquo; quarters, and kill
anyone or anything that tries to get to her. Anyone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a last look down at her&mdash;oh, Light, any
other time, she would have thought she could die happily, seeing
that look in his eyes!&mdash;he went running, away from the
ruination. Away from her. Whoever had tried to kill him would be
hunting for him.</p>

<p>Morr patted her on the arm with a dusty hand and gave
her a boyish grin. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Min. I&rsquo;ll take care of
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But who was going to take care of Rand? Can I trust
you, he had asked this boy who had been one of the first to come
asking to learn. Light, who would make him safe?</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Rounding a corner, Rand stopped with a hand against
one wall to seize the Source. A fool thing, not wanting Min to see
him stagger when someone tried to kill him, but there it was. Not
just any someone. A man, Demandred, or perhaps Asmodean come back
at last. Maybe both; there had been an oddity, as if the weaving
came from different directions. He had felt the channeling too late
to do anything. He would have died, in his rooms. He was ready to
die. But not Min, no, not Min. Elayne was better off, turning
against him. Oh, Light, she was!</p>

<p>He seized the Source, and <em>saidin</em> flooded him
with molten cold and freezing heat, with life and sweetness, filth
and death. His stomach twisted, and the hallway in front of him
doubled itself. For an instant, he thought he saw a face. Not with
his eyes; in his head. A man, shimmering and unrecognizable, gone.
He floated in the Void, empty, and full of the Power.</p>

<p><em>You won&rsquo;t win</em>, he told Lews Therin.
<em>If I die, I&rsquo;ll die</em> me!</p>

<p><em>I should have sent Ilyena away</em>, Lews Therin
whispered back. <em>She would have lived</em>.</p>

<p>Pushing the voice away as he pushed himself from the
wall, Rand slipped along the Palace corridors with all the stealth
he could muster, stepping lightly, gliding close to tapestry-hung
walls, around gold-worked chests and gilded cabinets bearing
fragile golden porcelains and ivory statuettes. His eyes searched
for his attackers. They would not be satisfied short of finding his
body, but they would be very careful in approaching his rooms in
case he had survived by some <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> swirl of fate.
They would wait, to see whether he stirred. In the Void, he was as
near one with the Power as any man could live through. In the Void,
as with a sword, he was one with his surroundings.</p>

<p>Frantic shouts and clamor rose in every direction,
some screaming to know what had happened, others crying that the
Dragon Reborn had gone mad. The bundle of frustration in his head
that was Alanna provided one small comfort. She was out of the
Palace, as she had been all morning, maybe even outside the city
walls. He wished Min was, too. Sometimes he saw men and women down
one hallway or another, black-liveried servants mainly, running,
falling down and scrambling up to run again. They did not see him.
With the Power in him, he could hear every whisper. Including the
whisper of soft boots running, light-footed.</p>

<p>Backing against the wall beside a long table topped
with porcelain, he quickly wove Fire and Air around himself and
held very still wrapped in Folded Light.</p>

<p>Maidens appeared, a stream of them, veiled, and ran
by without seeing him. Toward his apartments. He could not let them
accompany him; he had promised, but to let them fight, not to lead
them to slaughter. When he found Demandred and Asmodean, all the
Maidens could do was die, and he already had five names to learn
and add to his list. Somara of the Bent Peak Daryne was already
there. A promise he had had to make, a promise he had to keep. For
that promise alone, he deserved to die!</p>

<p><em>Eagles and women can only be kept safe in
cages</em>, Lews Therin said as though quoting, then abruptly began
weeping as the last of the Maidens vanished.</p>

<p>Rand moved on, sweeping back and forth through the
palace in arcs that slowly moved away from his apartments. Folded
Light used very little of the Power&mdash;so little no man could
have felt the use of <em>saidin</em> unless right on top of it&mdash;and he used it whenever anyone seemed about to see him. His
attackers had not struck at his rooms on the chance he would be
there. They had eyes-and-ears in the Palace. Maybe it had been <em>
ta&rsquo;veren</em> work that pulled him out of the apartments, if a
<em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> could work on himself, and maybe just
happenstance, but perhaps his tugging at the Pattern could bring
his attackers within his grasp while they thought him dead or
injured. Lews Therin chuckled at the thought. Rand could almost
feel the man rubbing his hands in anticipation.</p>

<p>Three more times he had to hide behind the Power as
veiled Maidens rushed by, and once when he saw Cadsuane sweeping
along the corridor ahead with no fewer than six Aes Sedai at her
heels, and not one other that he recognized besides her. They
seemed to be hunting. He was not afraid of the gray-haired sister,
precisely. No, of course not afraid! But he waited until she and
her friends were well out of sight before letting his concealing
weave go. Lews Therin did not chuckle over Cadsuane. He was deathly
silent until she was gone.</p>

<p>Rand stepped away from the wall, a door opened right
beside him, and Ailil peeked out. He had not known he was near her
rooms. Behind her shoulder stood a dark woman with fat golden rings
in her ears and a medallion-filled golden chain running across her
left cheek to her nose ring. Shalon, Windfinder to Harine din
Togara, the Atha&rsquo;an Miere ambassador who had moved into the
Palace with her retinue almost as Merana informed him of the
agreement. And meeting with a woman who might want him dead. Their
eyes popped at the sight of him.</p>

<p>He was as gentle as he could be, but he had to be
quick. A few moments after the door opened, he was tucking a
somewhat rumpled Ailil beneath her bed alongside Shalon. Perhaps
they were not part of what was happening. Perhaps. Safe was better
than sorry. Glaring at him above mouths wadded full of Ailil&rsquo;s
scarves, the two women writhed against the torn strips of bedsheet
he had used to bind their wrists and ankles. The shield he had tied
off on Shalon would hold her for a day or two before the knot
unraveled, but someone would find them and cut their other bonds
before too much longer.</p>

<p>Worrying about that shield, he opened the door enough
to check the hallway, and hurried out, along the empty corridor. He
could not have left the Windfinder free to channel, but shielding a
woman was not a matter of dribbles of the Power. If one of his
attackers had been close enough&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;But he saw no one down any of
the crossing corridors, either.</p>

<p>Fifty paces beyond Ailil&rsquo;s rooms, the corridor
opened into a square-railed balcony of blue marble with broad
stairs at either end, fronting a square chamber with a high,
vaulted ceiling and the same sort of balcony at the other side.
Tapestries ten paces long hung along the walls, birds soaring to
the skies in rigid patterns. Below, Dashiva stood looking about,
licking his lips uncertainly. Gedwyn and Rochaid were with him!
Lews Therin chittered of killing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;telling you <em>I</em> felt nothing,&rdquo; Gedwyn
was saying. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Dashiva saw Rand, at the head of the stairs.</p>

<p>The only warning he had was the sudden snarl that
contorted Dashiva&rsquo;s face. Dashiva channeled, and with no time
to think, Rand wove&mdash;as so often, he did not know what;
something dredged from Lews Therin&rsquo;s memories; he was not even
sure he created the weave entirely himself, or whether Lews Therin
snatched at <em>saidin</em>&mdash;Air and Fire and Earth woven
around himself just so. The fire that leaped from Dashiva erupted,
shattering marble, flinging Rand back down the hallway, bounding
and rolling in his cocoon.</p>

<p>That barrier would keep out anything short of
balefire. Including air to breathe. Rand released it panting,
scraping along the floor, with the crash of the explosions still
ringing in the air, dust still hanging and bits of broken marble
tumbling. As much as for breath, though, he let it go because what
could keep the Power out, kept it in. Before he stopped sliding, he
channeled Fire and Air, but woven much differently than for Folded
Light. Thin red wires leaped from his left hand, fanning out as
they sliced through the intervening stone toward where Dashiva and
the others had been standing. From his left sped balls of flame,
Fire woven with Air, faster than he could count, and they burned
through the stone before exploding in that chamber. One continuous
deafening roar made the Palace tremble. Dust that had fallen rose
up again, and pieces of stone bounced.</p>

<p>Almost immediately, though, he was up and running,
back past Ailil&rsquo;s apartments. The man who struck and stayed in
one spot was asking to die. He was ready to die, but not yet.
Snarling soundlessly, he sped down another hall, descended narrow
servants&rsquo; stairs, and came out on the floor below.</p>

<p>He took care making his way back to where he had seen
Dashiva, deadly weaves ready to fling at so much as a glimpse.</p>

<p><em>I should have killed them all in the
beginning</em>, Lews Therin panted. <em>I should have killed them
all!</em></p>

<p>Rand let him rage.</p>

<p>The large chamber seemed to have been washed in fire.
Only charred fragments licked by flames remained of the tapestries,
and great gouges a pace across had been burned into floor and
walls. The stairs Rand had been about to descend ended in a
ten-foot gap halfway down. Of the three men, there was no sign.
They would not have been consumed completely. Something would have
remained.</p>

<p>A servant in a black coat cautiously poked his head
from a tiny door beside the stairs on the other side of the
chamber. His eyes fell on Rand, rolled up in his head, and he fell
forward in a heap. Another servant peeped out of a corridor, then
gathered her skirts and raced back the way she had come, shrieking
at the top of her lungs that the Dragon Reborn was killing everyone
in the Palace.</p>

<p>Rand slipped out of the chamber grimacing. He was
very good at frightening people who could not harm him. Very good
at destroying.</p>

<p><em>To destroy, or be destroyed</em>, Lews Therin
laughed. <em>When that&rsquo;s your choice, is there a
difference?</em></p>

<p>Somewhere in the Palace, a man channeled enough of
the Power to make a gateway. Dashiva and the others fleeing? Or
wanting him to think that?</p>

<p>He walked the corridors of the Palace, no longer
bothering to hide. Everyone else seemed to be. The few servants he
saw, fled screaming. Corridor after corridor, he hunted, filled
near to bursting with <em>saidin</em>, full of fire and ice trying
to annihilate him as surely as Dashiva had, full of the taint
worming its way into his soul. He had no need of Lews Therin&rsquo;s
ragged laughter and ravings to be filled with a desire to kill.</p>

<p>A glimpse of a black coat ahead, and his hand shot
up, fire streaking, exploding, tearing away the corner where the
two hallways met. Rand let the weave subside, but did not let it
go. Had he killed him?</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord Dragon,&rdquo; a voice shouted from beyond the
torn stonework, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s me, Narishma! And Flinn!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t recognize you,&rdquo; Rand lied. &ldquo;Come
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think maybe your blood&rsquo;s hot,&rdquo; Flinn&rsquo;s
voice called, &ldquo;I think may we should wait for everybody to cool
down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Rand said slowly. Had he really tried to kill
Narishma? He did not think he could claim the excuse of Lews
Therin. &ldquo;Yes, that might be best. For a little while longer.&rdquo; There
was no answer. Did he hear boots retreating? He forced his hands
down and turned another way.</p>

<p>He searched through the Palace for hours without
finding a sign of Dashiva or the others. The corridors and great
halls, even the kitchens, were empty of people. He found nothing,
and learned nothing. No. He realized that he had learned one thing.
Trust was a knife, and the hilt was as sharp as the blade.</p>

<p>Then he found pain.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The small stone-walled room was deep below the Sun
Palace and warm despite the lack of a fireplace, but Min felt cold.
Three gilded lamps on the tiny wooden table gave more than enough
light. Rand had said that from there, he could get her away even if
someone tried to root the Palace out of the ground. He had not
sounded as if he were joking.</p>

<p>Holding the crown of Illian on her lap, she watched
Rand. Watched Rand watching Fedwin. Her hands tightened on the
crown, and loosened immediately at the stabs of those small swords
hidden among the laurel leaves. Strange, that the crown and scepter
should have survived when the Dragon Throne itself was a pile of
gilded splinters buried in rubble. A large leather scrip beside her
chair, with Rand&rsquo;s sword belt and scabbarded sword resting
against it, held what else he had been able to salvage. Strange
choices for the most part, in her estimation.</p>

<p><em>You brainless loobie</em>, she thought. <em>Not
thinking about what&rsquo;s right in front of you won&rsquo;t make it
go away</em>.</p>

<p>Rand sat cross-legged on the bare stone floor, still
covered in dust and scratches, his coat torn. His face might have
been carved. He seemed to watch Fedwin without blinking. The boy
was sitting on the floor, too, his legs sprawled out. Tongue caught
between his teeth, Fedwin was concentrating on making a tower out
of blocks of wood. Min swallowed hard.</p>

<p>She could still remember the horror when she realized
the boy &ldquo;guarding&rdquo; her now had the mind of a small child. The
sadness remained, too&mdash;Light, he was only a boy! it was not
right!&mdash;but she hoped Rand still had him shielded. It had not
been easy, talking Fedwin into playing with those wooden blocks
instead of pulling stones out of the walls with the Power to make a
&ldquo;big tower to keep you safe in.&rdquo; And then <em>she</em> had sat
guarding <em>him</em> until Rand came. Oh, Light, she wanted to
cry. For Rand even more than Fedwin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You hide yourself in the depths, it appears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The deep voice was not finished speaking from the
doorway before Rand was on his feet, facing Mazrim Taim. As usual,
the hook-nosed man wore a black coat with blue-and-gold Dragons
spiraling up the arms. Unlike the other Asha&rsquo;man, he had
neither Sword nor Dragon on his high collar. His dark face wore
nearly as little expression as Rand&rsquo;s. Now, staring at Taim,
Rand seemed to be gritting his teeth. Min surreptitiously eased a
knife in her coatsleeve. As many images and auras danced around one
as the other, but it was not a viewing that made her suddenly wary.
She had seen a man trying to decide whether to kill another before,
and she was seeing it again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You come here holding <em>saidin</em>, Taim?&rdquo; Rand
said, much too softly. Taim spread his hands, and Rand said,
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better.&rdquo; But he did not relax.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was just that I thought I might be stabbed by
accident,&rdquo; Taim said, &ldquo;making my way here through corridors packed
with those Aiel women. They seem agitated.&rdquo; His eyes never left
Rand, but Min was sure he had noticed her touching her knife.
&ldquo;Understandably, of course,&rdquo; he went on smoothly. &ldquo;I cannot express
my joy at finding you alive after seeing what I did above. I came
to report deserters. Normally, I wouldn&rsquo;t have bothered, but
these are Gedwyn, Rochaid, Torval, and Kisman. It seems they were
malcontented over events in Altara, but I never thought they would
go this far. I haven&rsquo;t seen any of the men I left with you.&rdquo;
For an instant, his gaze flickered to Fedwin. For no more than an
instant. &ldquo;There were&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;other&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;casualties? I will take this
one with me, if you wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told them to stay out of sight,&rdquo; Rand said in a
harsh voice. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll take care of Fedwin. Fedwin Morr, Taim;
not &lsquo;this one.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; He actually backed to the small table to
pick up the silver cup sitting among the lamps. Min&rsquo;s breath
caught.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Wisdom in my village could cure anything,&rdquo; Rand
said as he knelt beside Fedwin. Somehow, he managed to smile at the
boy without taking his eyes from Taim. Fedwin smiled back happily
and tried to take the cup, but Rand held it for him to drink. &ldquo;She
knows more about herbs than anybody I&rsquo;ve ever met. I learned a
little from her, which are safe, which not.&rdquo; Fedwin sighed as Rand
took the cup away and held the boy to his chest. &ldquo;Sleep, Fedwin,&rdquo;
Rand murmured.</p>

<p>It did seem that the boy was going to sleep. His eyes
closed. His chest rose and fell more slowly. Slower. Until it
stopped. The smile never left his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little something in the wine,&rdquo; Rand said softly as
he laid Fedwin down. Min&rsquo;s eyes burned, but she would not cry.
She would not!</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are harder than I thought,&rdquo; Taim muttered.</p>

<p>Rand smiled at him, a hard feral smile. &ldquo;Add Corlan
Dashiva to your list of deserters, Taim. Next time I visit the
Black Tower, I expect to see his head on your Traitor&rsquo;s
Tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dashiva?&rdquo; Taim snarled, his eyes widening in
surprise. &ldquo;It will be as you say. When next you visit the Black
Tower.&rdquo; That quickly, he recovered himself, all polished stone and
poise once more. How she wished she could read her viewings of
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Return to the Black Tower, and don&rsquo;t come here
again.&rdquo; Standing, Rand faced the other man over Fedwin&rsquo;s body.
&ldquo;I may be moving about for a while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taim&rsquo;s bow was minuscule. &ldquo;As you command.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the door closed behind him, Min let out a long
breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No point wasting time, and no time to waste,&rdquo; Rand
muttered. Kneeling in front of her, he took the crown and slipped
it into the scrip with the other things. &ldquo;Min, I thought I was the
whole pack of hounds, chasing down one wolf after another, but it
seems I&rsquo;m the wolf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn you,&rdquo; she breathed. Tangling both hands in his
hair, she stared in his eyes. Now blue, now gray, a morning sky
just at sunrise. And dry. &ldquo;You can cry, Rand al&rsquo;Thor. You
won&rsquo;t melt if you cry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have time for tears, either, Min,&rdquo; he
said gently. &ldquo;Sometimes the hounds catch the wolf and wish they
hadn&rsquo;t. Sometimes he turns on them, or waits in ambush. But first,
the wolf has to run.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When do we go?&rdquo; she asked. She did not let go of his
hair. She was never going to let go of him. Never.<br clear="all">
