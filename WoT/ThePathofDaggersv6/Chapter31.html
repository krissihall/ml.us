winds and winter snows slowed the passage of
trade across lands where they did not end it until spring, and for
every three pigeons sent by merchants, two fell to hawks or
weather, but where ice did not cover the rivers, ships still
sailed, and rumor flew faster than lightnings. A thousand rumors,
each throwing off a thousand seeds that sprouted and grew in snow
and ice as in fertile soil.</p>

<p>At Tar Valon, some stories said, great armies had
clashed, and the streets ran with blood, and rebel Aes Sedai had
stuck the head of Elaida a&rsquo;Roihan on a pike. No; Elaida had
closed her hand, and those who survived among the rebels groveled
at Elaida&rsquo;s feet. There had been no rebels, no division of the
White Tower. It was the Black Tower that had been broken, by Aes
Sedai designs and Aes Sedai power, and Asha&rsquo;man hunted
Asha&rsquo;man across the nations. The White Tower had shattered the
Sun Palace in Cairhien, and the Dragon Reborn himself was bound now
to the Amyrlin Seat, her puppet and her tool. Some tales said Aes
Sedai had been bound to him, bound to the Asha&rsquo;man, yet few
believed that, and those few were ridiculed.</p>

<p>Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s armies had returned to reclaim
his long-dead empire, and the Seanchan were sweeping all before
them, even to driving the Dragon Reborn from Altara in defeat. The
Seanchan had come to serve him. No; he had cast the Seanchan into
the sea, destroying their army utterly. They had carried the Dragon
Reborn away, to kneel before their Empress. The Dragon Reborn was
dead, and there was as much celebration as mourning, as many tears
as cries of joy.</p>

<p>Across the nations the stories spread like spiderweb
laid upon spiderweb, and men and women planned the future,
believing they knew truth. They planned, and the Pattern absorbed
their plans, weaving toward the future foretold.</p>
