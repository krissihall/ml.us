<h4><em>A Pleasant Ride</em></h4>

and pastures and olive groves covered most of
the land around Ebou Dar, but many small forests stretched a few
miles across as well, and while the ground was much flatter than
the Rhannon Hills to the south, it rolled and sometimes rose in a
prominence of a hundred feet or higher, sufficient to cast deep
shadows in the afternoon sun. All in all, the country provided more
than enough cover to keep unwanted eyes from what might have passed
as some odd merchant&rsquo;s pack train, nearly fifty people mounted
and almost as many afoot, especially when it had Warders to find
unfrequented paths through the undergrowth. Elayne did not sight a
mark of human habitation beyond a few goats cropping on some of the
hills.</p>

<p>Even plants and trees used to heat were beginning to
wither and die, yet at any other time she might have enjoyed merely
seeing the countryside. It could have been a thousand leagues from
the land she had seen riding down the other bank of the Eldar. The
hills were strange, knobby shapes, as though squeezed together by
huge, careless hands. Flocks of brilliantly hued birds soared up at
their passing, and a dozen sorts of hummingbirds flitted away from
the horses, hovering jewels on blurred wings. Thick vines hung like
ropes in some places, and there were trees with bundles of narrow
fronds at the top for foliage, and things that looked like green
feather dusters as tall as a man. A handful of plants, fooled by
the heat, struggled to put out blossoms, bright reds and vivid
yellows, some twice as wide as her two hands. Their perfume was
lush and&mdash;&ldquo;sultry&rdquo; came to mind. She saw some boulders she
would have wagered had once been toes on a statue, though why
anyone would make a statue that large with bare feet she could not
imagine, and another time the way led through a forest of thick
fluted stones among the trees, the weathered stumps of columns,
many toppled and all long since mined almost to the ground for
their stone by local farmers. A pleasant ride despite the dust the
horses&rsquo; hooves raised from parched soil. The heat did not
touch her, of course, and there were not very many flies. All the
dangers lay behind them; they had outrun the Forsaken, and no
chance any of them or their servants could catch up now. It <em>
could</em> have been a pleasant ride, except&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For one thing, Aviendha learned that the message she
had sent about enemies coming when least expected had not been
delivered. At first Elayne felt relief at anything to change the
topic from Rand. It was not the jealousy come back; rather, more
and more she found herself wanting what Aviendha had shared with
him. Not jealousy. Envy. She would almost have preferred the other.
Then she began really hearing what her friend was saying in a low
monotone, and the hair on the back of her neck tried to stand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; she protested, reining her
horse closer to Aviendha&rsquo;s. Actually, she supposed Aviendha
would not have much trouble drubbing Kurin, or tying her up, or any
of the rest. If the other Sea Folk women stood still for it,
anyway. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t start a war with them, certainly not before
we use the Bowl. And not over this,&rdquo; she added hastily. &ldquo;Not at
all.&rdquo; They certainly were not going to start a war before or after
the Bowl was used. Not just because the Windfinders were behaving
more highhandedly by the hour. Not just because&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Drawing
breath, she hurried on. &ldquo;If she <em>had</em> told me, I would not
have known what you meant. I understand why you couldn&rsquo;t speak
more clearly, but you do see, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha glared ahead at nothing, absently brushing
flies away from her face. &ldquo;Without fail, I told her,&rdquo; she grumbled.
&ldquo;Without fail! What if he had been one of the Shadowsouled? What if
he had managed to get by me through the gateway, and you with no
warning? What if&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; She turned a suddenly forlorn gaze on
Elayne. &ldquo;I will bite my knife,&rdquo; she said sadly, &ldquo;but my liver may
burst for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne was about to say that swallowing her anger was
the right thing to do and she could pitch as large a fit as she
wanted so long as she did not hurl it at the Atha&rsquo;an Miere&mdash;that was what all that about knives and livers meant&mdash;but before she could open her mouth, Adeleas brought her rangy gray
up on her other side. The white-haired sister had acquired a new
saddle in Ebou Dar, a gaudy thing worked with silver on pommel and
cantle. The flies seemed to avoid her, for some reason, though she
wore a scent as strong as any of the flowers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me. I could not help overhearing that last.&rdquo;
Adeleas did not sound at all apologetic, and Elayne wondered just
how much she had overheard. She felt her cheeks coloring. Some of
what Aviendha had said about Rand had been remarkably frank and
straightforward. Some of what she had said had been, too. It was
one thing to talk that way with your nearest friend, quite another
to suspect someone else had been listening. Aviendha seemed to feel
the same way; she did not blush, but the sour look she shot at the
Brown would have done Nynaeve proud.</p>

<p>Adeleas merely smiled, a vague smile as bland as
water soup. &ldquo;It might be best if you gave your friend there free
rein with the Atha&rsquo;an Miere.&rdquo; She peered past Elayne at
Aviendha, blinking. &ldquo;Well, a loose rein. Putting the fear of the
Light into them ought to be sufficient. They&rsquo;re almost there
already, in case you haven&rsquo;t noticed. They&rsquo;re much more
wary of the &lsquo;savage&rsquo; Aiel&mdash;forgive me, Aviendha&mdash;than they are of Aes Sedai. Merilille would have suggested
it, but her ears are still burning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha&rsquo;s face rarely gave much away, but right
then she looked as puzzled as Elayne felt. Elayne twisted in her
saddle to frown behind her. Merilille rode abreast with Vandene,
Careane, and Sareitha not far back, all very studiously looking at
anything except Elayne. Beyond the sisters were the Sea Folk, still
in single file, and then would come the Knitting Circle, keeping
themselves out of sight for the moment just ahead of the
packhorses. They were threading their way through the glades of
truncated columns. Fifty or a hundred long-tailed red-and-green
birds winged over their heads, filling the air with chattering
cries.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Elayne asked curtly. It seemed foolish to add
to the turmoil already bubbling just below the surface&mdash;and
sometimes on the surface&mdash;but she had seen no hint of the
fool in Adeleas. The Brown sister&rsquo;s eyebrows rose in apparent
surprise. Maybe she was surprised; Adeleas usually thought anyone
should see what she saw. Maybe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why? To restore a little balance, that is why. If
the Atha&rsquo;an Miere feel they need us to protect them from an
Aiel, it might be a useful balance against&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Adeleas paused
slightly, suddenly absorbed in adjusting her pale gray skirts. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;other things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s face tightened. Other things. The
bargain with the Sea Folk was what Adeleas meant. &ldquo;You may ride
with the others,&rdquo; she said coolly.</p>

<p>Adeleas made no protest, no attempts to press her
argument. She just inclined her head and let her horse fall back.
Her small smile never altered a whit. The older Aes Sedai accepted
that Nynaeve and Elayne stood above them and spoke with
Egwene&rsquo;s authority at their backs, but the truth was, that
changed little beyond the surface. Perhaps nothing. They were
outwardly respectful, they obeyed, and yet&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After all was said and done, Elayne, at least, was
Aes Sedai at an age when most initiates of the Tower still wore
novice white and very few had reached the Accepted. And she and
Nynaeve had agreed to that bargain, hardly a display of wisdom and
acumen. Not just the Sea Folk getting the Bowl, but twenty sisters
going to the Atha&rsquo;an Miere, subject to their laws, required to
teach anything the Windfinders wanted to learn and unable to leave
until others came to replace them. Windfinders allowed to enter the
Tower as guests, allowed to learn whatever they wished, leave
whenever they wished. Those alone would make the Hall scream, and
probably Egwene as well, yet the rest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Every last one of the
older sisters thought she would have found a way around making that
bargain. Perhaps they really could have. Elayne did not believe it,
but she was not sure.</p>

<p>She did not say anything to Aviendha, but after a few
moments, the other woman spoke. &ldquo;If I can serve honor and help you
at the same time, I do not care whether it serves some Aes Sedai
end.&rdquo; She never seemed to take it in that Elayne was also Aes
Sedai, not completely.</p>

<p>Elayne hesitated, then nodded. Something had to be
done to temper the Sea Folk. Merilille and the others had displayed
a remarkable forbearance so far, but how long would that last?
Nynaeve might explode, once she actually turned her attentions to
the Windfinders. Matters had to be kept as smooth as possible for
as long as possible, but if the Atha&rsquo;an Miere went on
believing they could stare down any Aes Sedai, there would be
trouble. Life was more complex than she had imagined back in
Caemlyn, no matter how many lessons she had received as
Daughter-Heir. So much more complicated since she entered the
Tower.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t be too&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;emphatic,&rdquo; she said
softly. &ldquo;And please have a care. There are twenty of them, after
all, and only one of you. I wouldn&rsquo;t want anything to happen
before I could help you.&rdquo; Aviendha gave her a grin with a good bit
of wolf in it and drew her dun mare off at the edge of the stones
to wait for the Atha&rsquo;an Miere.</p>

<p>From time to time Elayne glanced back, but all she
saw through the trees was Aviendha riding next to Kurin, speaking
quite calmly and not even looking at the Sea Folk woman. Certainly
not glaring, though Kurin seemed to stare at her with considerable
astonishment. When Aviendha thumped her horse back up to join
Elayne, flapping her reins&mdash;she would never be a horsewoman&mdash;Kurin rode forward to speak with Renaile, and a short time
later Renaile angrily sent Rainyn to the head of the column.</p>

<p>The most junior of the Windfinders sat her horse even
more awkwardly than Aviendha, whom she pretended to ignore on
Elayne&rsquo;s other side just as she ignored the small green flies
buzzing around her dark face. &ldquo;Renaile din Calon Blue Star,&rdquo; she
said stiffly, &ldquo;demands that you snub in the Aiel woman, Elayne Aes
Sedai.&rdquo; Aviendha grinned toothily at her, and Rainyn must have been
watching at least a little, because her cheeks reddened beneath the
sheen of sweat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell Renaile that Aviendha is not Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Elayne
replied. &ldquo;I will ask her to be careful,&rdquo; no lie there; she had, and
would again, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t <em>make</em> her do anything.&rdquo; On
impulse, she added, &ldquo;You know how Aiel are.&rdquo; The Sea Folk had some
very odd ideas of how the Aiel were. Rainyn stared wide-eyed at a
still-grinning Aviendha, her face going gray, then jerked her horse
around and galloped back to Renaile, bouncing in her saddle.</p>

<p>Aviendha gave a pleased chuckle, but Elayne wondered
whether the whole notion had been a mistake. Even with a good
thirty paces between them, she could see Renaile&rsquo;s face swell
up at Rainyn&rsquo;s report, and the others began to buzz like bees.
They did not look frightened, they looked angry, and the glares
they directed at the Aes Sedai ahead of them grew baleful. Not at
Aviendha, at the sisters. Adeleas nodded thoughtfully when she saw
that, and Merilille just barely failed to hide a smile. At least
they were pleased.</p>

<p>If that had been the only incident during the ride it
would have taken the edge off any enjoyment of flowers and birds,
but it was not even the first. Beginning shortly after leaving the
clearing, the Knitting Circle had made their way forward to Elayne
one by one, all but Kirstian, and no doubt she would have come too
had she not been ordered to keep Ispan shielded. One by one they
came, each hesitant, smiling timorously until Elayne wanted to tell
them to act their ages. They certainly made no demands, and they
were too smart to ask straight out for what already had been
denied, but they found other paths.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It occurred to me,&rdquo; Reanne said brightly, &ldquo;that you
must want to question Ispan Sedai quite urgently. Who can say what
else she was up to in the city besides trying to find the
storeroom?&rdquo; She pretended to just be making conversation, but from
time to time she darted quick looks at Elayne to see how she was
taking it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll take over an hour to reach the
farm, the way we&rsquo;re going, perhaps two, and you certainly
don&rsquo;t want to waste two hours. The herbs Nynaeve Sedai gave
her make her quite talkative, and I&rsquo;m sure she would sit up
for sisters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bright smile faded when Elayne said that
questioning Ispan could wait and would. Light, did they really
expect anyone to ask questions riding through forests on paths that
barely deserved the name? Reanne rode back to the other Kinswomen,
muttering to herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgiveness, Elayne Sedai,&rdquo; Chilares murmured a
short time later, the traces of Murandy clinging to her accent. Her
green straw hat matched some of her layered petticoats exactly.
&ldquo;Your forgiveness, if I intrude.&rdquo; She did not wear the red belt of
a Wise Woman; most of the Knitting Circle did not. Famelle was a
goldsmith, and Eldase supplied lacquerware to the merchants for
export; Chilares was a rug seller, while Reanne herself arranged
shipping for small traders. Some worked at simple tasks&mdash;Kirstian ran a tiny weaver&rsquo;s shop, and Dimana was a
seamstress, though a prosperous one&mdash;but then, in the course
of their lives, they had all followed many crafts. And used many
names. &ldquo;Ispan Sedai appears to be unwell,&rdquo; Chilares said, shifting
uneasily in her saddle. &ldquo;Perhaps the herbs are affecting her more
than Nynaeve Sedai thought. It would be terrible if anything
happened to her. Before she can be questioned, I mean. Perhaps the
sisters would look at her? Healing, you know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She trailed
off, blinking those big brown eyes nervously. As well she might,
with Sumeko among her companions.</p>

<p>A glance back showed the stout woman standing in her
stirrups to peer past the Windfinders, until she saw Elayne looking
and sat back down hurriedly. Sumeko, who knew more of Healing than
any sister except Nynaeve. Perhaps <em>more</em> than Nynaeve.
Elayne simply pointed to the rear until Chilares colored and reined
her mount around.</p>

<p>Merilille joined Elayne only moments after Reanne
left, and the Gray sister made a much better pretense at simple
chat than the Kinswoman had. In her manner of speaking, at least,
she was poise itself. What she had to say was another matter. &ldquo;I
wonder how trustworthy those women are, Elayne.&rdquo; Her lips pursed in
distaste as she brushed dust from her divided blue skirts with a
gloved hand. &ldquo;They say they do not take in wilders, but Reanne
herself may well be a wilder, whatever she claims about failing her
test for Accepted. Sumeko, as well, and certainly Kirstian.&rdquo; A
slight frown for Kirstian, a dismissive shake of her head. &ldquo;You
must have noticed how she leaps at any mention of the Tower. She
knows no more than she might have picked up in conversation with
someone who really was put out.&rdquo; Merilille sighed, regretting what
she had to say; she really was very good. &ldquo;Have you considered that
they may be lying about other things? They could be Darkfriends,
for all we know, or dupes of Darkfriends. Perhaps not, but they are
hardly to be trusted very far. I believe there is a farm, whether
they really use it for a retreat or not, or I would not have agreed
to this, but I will not be surprised to find a few ramshackle
buildings and a dozen or so wilders. Well, not ramshackle&mdash;they do seem to have coin&mdash;but the principle is the same. No,
they are simply not trustworthy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne began a slow burn as soon as she realized the
direction Merilille was taking, and it grew hotter. As this
slipping around, all this &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;could&rdquo; so the woman could
insinuate things she herself did not believe. Darkfriends? The
Knitting Circle had <em>fought</em> Darkfriends. Two had died. And
without Sumeko and Ieine, Nynaeve might be dead instead of Ispan a
prisoner. No, the reason they were not to be trusted was not
because Merilille feared they were sworn to the Shadow, or she
would have said so. They were not to be trusted because if they
were not trusted, then they could not be allowed to hold Ispan.</p>

<p>She swatted a big green fly that had settled on
Lioness&rsquo;s neck, punctuating Merilille&rsquo;s last word with a
loud crack, and the Gray sister jerked in surprise. &ldquo;How dare you?&rdquo;
Elayne breathed. &ldquo;They faced Ispan and Falion in the Rahad, and the
<em>gholam</em>, not to mention two dozen or more toughs with
swords. <em>You</em> weren&rsquo;t there.&rdquo; That was hardly fair.
Merilille and the rest had been left behind because Aes Sedai in
the Rahad, obvious Aes Sedai, might as well be trumpets and drums
for the attention they attracted. She did not care. Her anger grew
by the moment, and her voice rose by the word. &ldquo;You will <em>
never</em> suggest such a thing to me again. <em>Never</em>! Not
without hard evidence! Not without <em>proof</em>! If you do,
I&rsquo;ll set you a penance that will make your eyes pop!&rdquo; No
matter how high she stood above the other woman, she had no
authority to set her any penance at all, but she did not care about
that, either. I&rsquo;ll make you <em>walk</em> the rest of the way
to Tar Valon! Eating nothing but bread and water the entire way!
I&rsquo;ll put <em>you</em> in their charge, and tell them to slap
you down if you say boo to a <em>goose</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It dawned on her that she was shouting. Some sort of
gray-and-white birds went flittering past overhead in a broad band,
and she was drowning out their cries. Drawing a deep breath, she
tried to calm herself. She did not have a voice for shouting; it
always came out as a shriek. Everyone was looking at her, most in
astonishment. Aviendha nodded approvingly. Of course, she have done
the same had Elayne plunged a knife into Merilille&rsquo;s heart.
Aviendha stood beside her friends no matter what. Merilille&rsquo;s
Cairhienin paleness had become dead white.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean what I say,&rdquo; Elayne told her, in a much
cooler tone. It seemed to make even more blood leave
Merilille&rsquo;s face. She did mean every word; they could not
afford that sort of rumor floating among them. One way or another
she would see it done, though the Knitting Circle very likely would
faint.</p>

<p>She hoped that was the end of it. It should have
been. But when Chilares left, Sareitha replaced her, and she too
had a reason the Kinswomen were not to be trusted. Their ages. Even
Kirstian claimed to be older than any living Aes Sedai, while
Reanne was over a hundred years more than that and not even the
oldest of the Kin. Her title of Eldest went to the oldest of them
in Ebou Dar, and the rigid schedule they followed to avoid notice
had a number of still older women off in other places. It was
obviously impossible, Sareitha maintained.</p>

<p>Elayne did not shout; she very carefully did not
shout. &ldquo;We will learn the truth eventually,&rdquo; she told Sareitha. She
did not doubt the Kinswomen&rsquo;s word, but there had to be a
reason why the Kinswomen looked neither ageless nor anything near
the ages they claimed. If she could only puzzle it out. Something
told her it was obvious, but nothing leaped up said what.
&ldquo;Eventually,&rdquo; she added firmly when the Brown opened her mouth
again. &ldquo;That will be enough, Sareitha.&rdquo; Sareitha nodded uncertainly
and fell back. Not ten minutes later, Sibella replaced her.</p>

<p>Every time one of the Kinswomen came to make her
roundabout plea to be relieved of Ispan, one of the sisters came
soon after to offer the same plea. All save Merilille, who still
blinked whenever Elayne looked at her. Perhaps shouting did have
its uses. Certainly no one else tried to be so straightforward in
attacking the Kin.</p>

<p>For instance, Vandene began with discussing the Sea
Folk and how to counter the effects of the bargain made with them,
why it was necessary to counter them as much as possible. She was
quite matter-of-fact, with never a word or gesture to lay any
blame. Not that she needed any; the subject did that, however
delicately handled. The White Tower, she said, maintained its
influence in the world not by force of arms, or persuasion, or even
by plotting or manipulation, though those two she brushed past
lightly. Rather the White Tower controlled or influenced events to
whatever extent they did because everyone saw the Tower as standing
apart and above, as more even than kings or queens. That in turn
depended on every Aes Sedai being seen that way, as mysterious and
apart, different from everyone else. A different flesh.
Historically, Aes Sedai who could not manage that&mdash;and there
were a few&mdash;were kept out of public view as much as
possible.</p>

<p>It took Elayne a little while to realize that the
thrust of the conversation had shifted away from the Sea Folk, and
to see where it was headed. A different flesh, mysterious and
apart, could not have a sack thrust over its head and be tied
across a saddle. Not where anyone who was not Aes Sedai could see,
anyway. In truth, the sisters would be rougher on Ispan than the
Knitting Circle could possibly make themselves be, just not in
public. The argument might have borne more weight had it come
first, but as it was, Elayne sent Vandene packing as quickly as she
did anyone else. And saw her replaced by Adeleas, right after
Sibella was told that if none of the Knitting Circle could
understand what Ispan was mumbling, then none of the sisters was
likely to either. Mumbling! Light! The Aes Sedai took their
repeated turns, and even knowing what they were up to, sometimes it
was hard to see the connection at first. By the time Careane began
by telling her that those boulders really had been toes once,
supposedly on a statue of some warrior queen nearly two hundred
feet high&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ispan stays where she is,&rdquo; she told Careane coolly
without waiting for more. &ldquo;Now, unless you really want to tell me
why the Shiotans thought of putting up a statue like that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;
The Green said ancient records claimed it had worn little more than
armor, and not a great deal of that! A queen! &ldquo;No? Then, if you
don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;d like to talk with Aviendha alone. Thank
you so much.&rdquo; Even being curt did not stop them, of course. She was
surprised they did not send Merilille&rsquo;s <em>maid</em> to take
a turn.</p>

<p>None of this would have happened had Nynaeve been
where she was meant to be. At least, Elayne was sure that Nynaeve
could have quelled the Knitting Circle and the sisters both, in
short order. She was a great one for quelling. The problem was that
Nynaeve had glued herself tight to Lan&rsquo;s side before they left
the first clearing. The Warders scouted ahead and to both sides of
their path, and sometimes to the rear, only riding back to the
column long enough to report what they had seen or give directions
on how to avoid a farm or a shepherd. Birgitte ranged far, never
spending more than moments with Elayne. Lan ranged farther. And
where Lan went, Nynaeve went.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one&rsquo;s making any trouble, are they?&rdquo; she
demanded with a dark stare for the Sea Folk, the first time she
followed Lan back. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all right, then,&rdquo; she said
before Elayne had a chance to open her mouth. Spinning her
round-bellied mare like a racer, she nicked the reins and galloped
after Lan holding her hat on with one hand, catching up to him just
as he vanished around the flank of the hill ahead. Of course, then
there really was nothing to complain about. Reanne had made her
visit, and Merilille hers, and everything seemed settled.</p>

<p>By the next time Nynaeve appeared, Elayne had
suffered through a number of disguised attempts to have Ispan
turned over to the sisters, Aviendha had spoken to Kurin, and the
Windfinders were on a slow boil, but when Elayne explained, Nynaeve
simply looked around, frowning. Of course, right at that moment
everyone had to be where they belonged. The Atha&rsquo;an Miere wore
glares, true, but the Knitting Circle were all behind them, and as
for the other sisters, no group of novices could have appeared more
well-behaved and innocent. Elayne wanted to shriek!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you can handle everything, Elayne,&rdquo;
Nynaeve said. &ldquo;You <em>have</em> had all that training to be a
queen. This can&rsquo;t be anywhere near so&mdash;Drat the man!
He&rsquo;s going again! You can handle it.&rdquo; And off she went,
galloping that poor mare as though it were a warhorse.</p>

<p>That was when Aviendha chose to discuss how Rand
seemed to like kissing the sides of her neck. And incidentally how
much she had liked it. Elayne had liked that when he did it to her,
too, but however used to discussing this sort of thing she had
become&mdash;uncomfortably used to it&mdash;she did not want to
talk about it right then. She was angry with Rand. It was unfair,
but if not for him, she could have told Nynaeve to stop treating
Lan like a child who might trip over his own feet and attend to her
own duties. She almost wanted to blame him for the way the Knitting
Circle was behaving, too, and the other sisters, and the
Windfinders. <em>It&rsquo;s one of the things men are for, taking
the blame</em>, she remembered Lini saying once, and laughing while
she did. <em>They usually deserve it, even if you don&rsquo;t know
exactly how</em>. Not fair, yet she wished he were there long
enough for her to box his ears, just once. Long enough to kiss him,
to have him kiss the sides of her neck softly. Long enough to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will listen to advice, even when he doesn&rsquo;t
like hearing it,&rdquo; she said abruptly, her face reddening. Light, for
all her talk about shame, in some areas Aviendha had none. And it
seemed that she herself no longer had any, either! &ldquo;But if I tried
to push him, he dug in his heels even when it was plain that I was
right. Was he that way with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha glanced at her and appeared to understand.
Elayne was not sure whether she liked that or not. At least there
was no more talk of Rand and kissing. For a while, anyway. Aviendha
had some knowledge of men&mdash;she had traveled with them as a
Maiden of the Spear, fought beside them&mdash;but she had never
wanted to be anything but <em>Far Dareis Mai</em>, and there were&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;gaps. Even with her dolls as a child she had always played at
the spears and raiding. She had never flirted, did not understand
it, and she did not understand why she felt the way she did when
Rand&rsquo;s eyes fell on her, or a hundred other things Elayne had
begun learning the first time she noticed a boy looking at her
differently than he did at the other boys. She expected Elayne to
teach her all of it, and Elayne tried. She really could talk to
Aviendha about anything. If only Rand had not been the example used
quite so often. If he had been there, she <em>would</em> have boxed
his ears. And kissed him. Then boxed his ears again.</p>

<p>Not a pleasant ride at all. A miserable ride.</p>

<p>Nynaeve made several more brief visits, before
finally coming to announce that the Kin&rsquo;s farm lay just ahead,
out of sight around a low rounded hill that appeared ready to fall
on its side. Reanne had been pessimistic in her estimate; the sun
had not fallen nearly two hours&rsquo; worth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be there very quickly, now,&rdquo; Nynaeve told
Elayne, not seeming to notice the sullen stare Elayne gave in
return. &ldquo;Lan, fetch Reanne up here, please. Best if they see a
familiar face right away.&rdquo; He whirled his horse away, and Nynaeve
turned in her saddle briefly to fix the sisters with a firm eye. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want you frightening them, now. You hold your tongues
until we have a chance to explain what&rsquo;s what. And hide your
faces. Pull up the hoods of your cloaks.&rdquo; Straightening without
waiting for any reply, she gave a satisfied nod. &ldquo;There. All
settled, and all right. I vow, Elayne, I don&rsquo;t know what you
were moaning so about. Everyone&rsquo;s doing exactly as they
should, so far as I can see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne ground her teeth. She wished they were in
Caemlyn already. That was where they were heading once this was
done. She had duties long overdue in Caemlyn. All she had to deal
with there was convincing the stronger Houses that the Lion Throne
was hers despite her long absence, that and handling a rival
claimant or two. There might not have been any had she been there
when her mother vanished, when she died, but the history of Andor
said there would be by now. Somehow, it seemed ever so much easier
than this.</p>
