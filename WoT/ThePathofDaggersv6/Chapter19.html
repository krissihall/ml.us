<h4><em>The Law</em></h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">G</span>etting
the Sitters to their mounts proved no bother;
they were as eager to be away as Egwene, especially Romanda and
Lelaine, both cold as the wind and with eyes like thunderclouds.
The rest were the very image of cool-eyed Aes Sedai serenity,
giving off composure like a heavy scent, yet they glided to their
horses so quickly that the nobles were left gaping and the brightly
clad servants scrambled in loading the packhorses to catch up as
best they could.</p>

<p>Egwene had Daishar set a hard pace in the snow, and
with no more than a look and a nod from her Lord Bryne made sure
the armored escorts moved as fast. Siuan on Bela and Sheriam on
Wing rushed to join her. For long stretches they churned through
fetlock-deep cover, the horses stepping high at near to a trot, the
Flame of Tar Valon rippling in the icy breeze, and even when it was
necessary to slow, when the horses were sinking knee-deep through
the snow crust, they kept to a fast walk.</p>

<p>The Sitters had no choice except to keep up, and
their speed cut down their opportunity to talk on the way. At that
tiring pace, a lack of attention to your horse could bring a broken
leg for the animal and a broken neck for you. Even so, Romanda and
Lelaine each managed to gather her coterie around her, and those
two knots floundered through the snow surrounded by wards against
eavesdropping. The pair seemed to be delivering tirades. Egwene
could imagine the topic. For that matter, other Sitters managed to
ride together for a time, exchanging a few words quietly and
casting cool glances sometimes at her and sometimes at the sisters
wrapped around by <em>saidar</em>. Only Delana never joined one of
those brief conversations. She stayed close beside Halima, who at
last admitted that she was cold. Face tight, the country woman held
her cloak close around her, but she still tried to comfort Delana,
whispering to her almost constantly. Delana seemed to need
comforting; her brows were drawn down, putting a crease in her
forehead that actually made her seem aged.</p>

<p>She was not the only one worried. The others masked
the feeling rigidly, radiating absolute poise, but the Warders rode
like men expecting the worst to leap out of the snow at the next
step, eyes shifting in an unceasing watch, disquieting cloaks
streaming in the wind to leave hands free. When an Aes Sedai
worried, her Warder worried, and the Sitters were too absorbed to
think of calming the men. Egwene was just as glad to see it. If the
Sitters were troubled, they had not yet made up their minds.</p>

<p>When Bryne rode out to confer with Uno, she took the
opportunity to ask what the two women had learned about Aes Sedai
and Tower Guards in Andor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; Siuan replied in a tight voice. Shaggy
Bela did not seem to be having any difficulty with the pace, but
Siuan did, gripping her reins tightly in one hand and the pommel of
her saddle with the other. &ldquo;As near as I can make out, there are
fifty rumors and no facts. It&rsquo;s a likely sort of tale to
spring up, but it might still be true.&rdquo; Bela lurched, her front
hooves sinking deep, and Siuan gasped. &ldquo;The Light burn all
horses!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sheriam had learned no more. She shook her head, and
sighed irritably. &ldquo;It sounds all feathers and nonsense to me,
Mother. There are <em>always</em> rumors of sisters sneaking about.
Didn&rsquo;t you ever learn to ride, Siuan?&rsquo; she added, her
voice suddenly dripping derision. &ldquo;By tonight, you&rsquo;ll be too
sore to walk!&rdquo; Sheriam&rsquo;s nerves must have been ragged for her
to burst out so openly. From the way she kept shifting in her
saddle, she had already achieved her prediction for Siuan.</p>

<p>Siuan&rsquo;s eyes hardened, and she opened her mouth
already half snarling, never mind who was watching from behind the
banner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be still, both of you!&rdquo; Egwene snapped. She took a
deep, calming breath. She was a bit ragged herself. Whatever
Arathelle believed, any force Elaida sent to interfere with them
would be too large for sneaking. That left the Black Tower, a
disaster in the making. You got further plucking the chicken in
front of you than trying to start on one up a tree. Especially when
the tree was in another country and there might not even be another
chicken.</p>

<p>Still, she bit off her words in giving Sheriam
instructions for once they reached the camp. She was the Amyrlin
Seat, and that meant <em>all</em> Aes Sedai were her
responsibility, even those following Elaida. Her voice was rock
steady, though. It was too late to be frightened once you grabbed
the wolf by the ears.</p>

<p>Sheriam&rsquo;s tilted eyes went wide at the orders.
&ldquo;Mother, if I may ask, why&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; She trailed off under
Egwene&rsquo;s level gaze, and swallowed. &ldquo;It will be as you say,
Mother,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;Strange. I remember the day you and
Nynaeve came to the Tower, two girls who couldn&rsquo;t decide
whether to be excited or frightened. So much has changed since
then. Everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing stays the same forever,&rdquo; Egwene told her.
She gave Siuan a significant look, but Siuan refused to see. She
appeared to be sulking. Sheriam looked sick.</p>

<p>Lord Bryne returned then, and he must have sensed the
mood among them. Aside from saying that they were making good time,
he kept his mouth shut. A wise man.</p>

<p>Making good time or not, the sun was sitting almost
on the treetops when they finally rode through the army&rsquo;s
sprawling camp. Wagons and tents cast long shadows across the snow,
and a number of men were hard at work building yet more low
shelters out of brush. There were not nearly enough tents, even for
all the soldiers, and the camp held almost as many harness-makers
and laundresses and fletchers and the like, all those who
inevitably followed any army. The ringing of anvils spoke of
farriers and armorers and blacksmiths still at their labors. Cook
fires were burning everywhere, and the cavalry peeled away, eager
for warmth and hot food as soon as their wearily plodding animals
were cared for. Surprisingly, Bryne rode on at Egwene&rsquo;s side
after she dismissed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will allow, Mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I thought I
might accompany you a while longer.&rdquo; Sheriam actually twisted in
her saddle to stare in astonishment. Siuan stared, too, straight
ahead, as if not daring to turn her suddenly wide eyes toward
him.</p>

<p>What did he think he could do? Act as her bodyguard?
Against <em>sisters</em>? That fellow with the drippy nose would do
as well. Reveal just how completely he was on her side? Tomorrow
was time enough for that, if all went well tonight; that revelation
now might easily stampede the Hall in directions she hardly dared
contemplate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tonight is for Aes Sedai business,&rdquo; she told him
firmly. But, silly as the suggestion was, he had offered to put
himself at risk for her. There was no telling his reasons&mdash;who knew why a man did <em>anything</em>?&mdash;yet she owed him
for that. Among other things. &ldquo;Unless I send Siuan to you tonight,
Lord Bryne, you should leave before morning. If blame for today
attaches itself to me, it might reflect on you, too. Staying could
prove dangerous. Even fatal. I don&rsquo;t think they would need
much excuse.&rdquo; No need to name who &ldquo;they&rdquo; were.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I gave my word,&rdquo; he replied quietly, patting
Traveler&rsquo;s neck. &ldquo;To Tar Valon.&rdquo; Pausing, he glanced toward
Siuan. It was less a hesitation than a consideration. &ldquo;Whatever
tonight&rsquo;s business is,&rdquo; he said finally, &ldquo;remember that you
have thirty thousand men and Gareth Bryne behind you. That should
count for something, even among Aes Sedai. Until tomorrow, Mother.&rdquo;
Reining his big-nosed bay around, he called over his shoulder, &ldquo;I
expect to see you tomorrow, too, Siuan. <em>Nothing</em> changes
that.&rdquo; Siuan stared at his back as he rode away. There was anguish
in her eyes.</p>

<p>Egwene could not help staring, too. He had never been
so open before, not nearly. Why now, of all times?</p>

<p>Crossing the forty or fifty paces that separated the
army&rsquo;s camp from the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s, she nodded to Sheriam,
who drew rein at the first tents. She and Siuan rode on. Behind
them, Sheriam&rsquo;s voice rose, surprisingly clear and steady.
&ldquo;The Amyrlin Seat calls the Hall to sit this day in formal session.
Let preparations be made with all speed.&rdquo; Egwene did not look
back.</p>

<p>At her tent, a bony groom kicking her layered woolen
skirts came running to take Daishar and Bela. Her face was pinched,
and she barely ducked her head before hurrying away with the horses
as quickly as she had come. The warmth of the glowing braziers
inside was like a fist closing down. Egwene had not realized how
cold it was outside until then. Or how cold she was.</p>

<p>Chesa took her cloak, and exclaimed when she felt her
hands. &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re ice to the bone, Mother.&rdquo; Chattering away,
she bustled around folding Egwene&rsquo;s cloak and Siuan&rsquo;s,
smoothing the neatly turned-down blankets on Egwene&rsquo;s cot,
touching a tray set on one of the chests that had been pulled down
from the stack. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d jump right into bed, with hot bricks all
around, if I was that chilled. As soon as I&rsquo;d eaten, anyway.
Warm outside does only so much good without warm inside. I&rsquo;ll
fetch a few extra bricks to tuck under your feet while you sup. And
for Siuan Sedai, of course. Oh, if I was as hungry as you must be,
I know I&rsquo;d be tempted to gulp my food, but that always gives
me pains in the stomach.&rdquo; Pausing by the tray, she eyed Egwene, and
nodded with satisfaction when she said that she would not eat too
fast.</p>

<p>Making a sober answer was not easy. Chesa was always
refreshing, but after today, Egwene almost laughed with pleasure.
There were no complications to Chesa. Two white bowls of lentil
stew stood on the tray, along with a tall pitcher of spiced wine,
two silver cups, and two large rolls. Somehow, the woman had known
Siuan would be eating with her. Steam rose from the bowls and
pitcher. How often had Chesa had to change that tray to make sure
warm food greeted Egwene straight away? Simple and uncomplicated.
And as caring as a mother. Or a friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must forgo bed for now, Chesa. I&rsquo;ve work yet
tonight. Would you leave us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Siuan shook her head as the tentflap fell behind the
plump woman. &ldquo;Are you sure she hasn&rsquo;t been in your service
since you were a babe?&rdquo; she muttered.</p>

<p>Taking one of the bowls, a roll, and a spoon, Egwene
settled into her chair with a sigh. She also embraced the Source
and warded the tent against listeners. Unfortunately, <em>
saidar</em> made her all that much more aware of half-frozen hands
and feet. The bits in between were not much warmer. The bowl seemed
almost too warm to handle, and the roll, as well. Oh, how she would
have loved to have those hot bricks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there anything more we can do?&rdquo; she asked, and
promptly gulped down a spoonful of stew. She was ravenous, and no
wonder, with nothing since breakfast and that early. Lentils and
woody carrots tasted like her mother&rsquo;s finest cooking. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t think of anything, but can you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can be done, has been. There isn&rsquo;t
anything else, short of the Creator putting a hand in.&rdquo; Siuan took
the other bowl and dropped onto the low stool, but then she sat
staring into her stew and stirring it with her spoon. &ldquo;You
wouldn&rsquo;t really tell him, would you?&rdquo; she said finally. &ldquo;I
couldn&rsquo;t bear if he knew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why on earth not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d take advantage,&rdquo; Siuan said darkly. &ldquo;Oh,
not <em>that</em>. I don&rsquo;t think <em>that</em>.&rdquo; She was quite
prudish in some areas. &ldquo;But the man would make my life the Pit of
Doom!&rdquo; And washing his smallclothes and polishing his boots and his
saddle every day was not?</p>

<p>Egwene sighed. How <em>could</em> such a sensible,
intelligent, capable woman turn into a scatterbrain over this one
subject? Like a hissing viper, an image rose in her head. Herself,
sitting on Gawyn&rsquo;s knee playing kissing games. In a tavern!
She shoved it away, hard. &ldquo;Siuan, I need your experience. I need
your brain. I can&rsquo;t afford to have you half-witted because of
Lord Bryne. If you can&rsquo;t pull yourself together, I&rsquo;ll pay
him what you owe, and forbid you to see him. I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said I&rsquo;d work off the debt,&rdquo; Siuan said
stubbornly. &ldquo;I have as much honor as Lord Gareth bloody Bryne! As
much and more! He keeps his word, and I keep mine! Besides, Min
told me I have to stay close to him or we&rsquo;ll both die. Or
something like that.&rdquo; A pinkness in her cheeks gave her away,
though. Her honor and Min&rsquo;s viewing notwithstanding, she was
simply willing to put up with anything to be near the man!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well. You&rsquo;re besotted, and if I tell you
to stay away from him, you&rsquo;ll either disobey or mope and wrap
the rest of your brains in a cloud. What are you going to do about
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scowling indignantly, Siuan went on for some little
time, growling what she would like to do about Gareth bloody Bryne.
He would have enjoyed none of it. Some, he might not have
survived.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Siuan,&rdquo; Egwene said warningly. &ldquo;You deny one more
time what&rsquo;s plain as your nose, and I&rsquo;ll tell him <em>
and</em> give him the money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Siuan pouted sullenly. She pouted! Sullenly! Siuan!
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have time to be in love. I barely have time to think,
between working for you <em>and</em> him. And even if everything
goes right tonight, I&rsquo;ll have twice as much to do. Besides&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Her face fell, and she shifted on the stool. &ldquo;What if he
doesn&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;return my feelings?&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
never even tried to kiss me. All he cares about is whether his
shirts are clean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene scraped her spoon through her bowl, and was
surprised when it came up empty. Nothing remained of the roll but a
few crumbs on her dress. Light, her middle still felt hollow. She
eyed Siuan&rsquo;s bowl hopefully; the woman seemed to have little
interest in anything but drawing circles in the lentils.</p>

<p>A sudden thought occurred to her. Why had Lord Bryne
insisted that Siuan work off her debt even after learning who she
was? Just because she had said she would? It was a preposterous
arrangement. Except that it did keep her close to him when nothing
else would have. For that matter, she herself had often wondered
why Bryne had agreed to build the army. He had to have known there
was a very good chance he was laying his head on the chopping
block. And why he had offered that army to her, a girl Amyrlin with
no real authority and not a friend among the sisters except Siuan,
as far as he knew? Could the answer to all of those questions be as
simple as&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;he loved Siuan? No; most men were frivolous and
flighty, but that was <em>truly</em> preposterous! Still, she
offered the suggestion, if only to amuse Siuan. It might cheer her
a little.</p>

<p>Siuan snorted in disbelief. It sounded odd, coming
from that pretty face, but no one could put quite so much
expression into a snort as she did. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a total idiot,&rdquo;
she said dryly. &ldquo;In fact, he has a good head on his shoulders. He
thinks like a woman, most of the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I still haven&rsquo;t heard you say you&rsquo;ll
straighten up, Siuan,&rdquo; Egwene persisted. &ldquo;You have to, one way or
another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, of course I will. I don&rsquo;t know
what&rsquo;s been the matter with me. It isn&rsquo;t as if I never
kissed a man before.&rdquo; Her eyes narrowed suddenly, as if she
expected Egwene to challenge her on that. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t spent my
<em>whole</em> life in the Tower. This is ridiculous! Chattering
about <em>men</em>, tonight of all nights!&rdquo; Peering into her bowl,
she seemed to realize for the first time that it held food. She
filled her spoon, gesturing with it at Egwene. &ldquo;You have to be
careful of your timing, more now than ever. If Romanda or Lelaine
grabs the tiller, you&rsquo;ll never get your hands on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ridiculous or not, something certainly had restored
Siuan&rsquo;s appetite. She went through her stew faster than Egwene
had hers, and not a crumb of the roll escaped her. Egwene found
that she had drawn her fingers through her own empty bowl. There
was nothing for it then but to lick off the last few lentils, of
course.</p>

<p>Discussing what was to happen tonight served no real
point. They had honed and refined what Egwene was to say, and when,
so many times that she was surprised she had not dreamed of it. She
certainly could have done her part in her sleep. Siuan insisted
anyway, skirting very near the point where Egwene would have to
call her down, going over it again and again, bringing up
possibilities they had discussed before a hundred times. Strangely,
Siuan had found herself a very good mood. She even essayed a little
humor, unusual for her of late, though some was on the gallows
side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know Romanda wanted to be Amyrlin herself once,&rdquo;
she said at one point. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard it was Tamra getting the
stole and staff that made her stalk off into retirement like a gull
with her tail feathers clipped. I&rsquo;ll lay a silver mark I
don&rsquo;t have to a fish scale that her eyes bulge twice as much
as Lelaine&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And later. &ldquo;I wish I could be there to hear them
howl. Somebody&rsquo;s going to before much longer, and I&rsquo;d
rather it was them than us. I never had the voice for singing.&rdquo; She
actually sang a little snatch about staring across the river at a
boy and having no boat. She was right; her voice was pleasant in
its fashion, but she could not carry a tune in a bucket.</p>

<p>And later still. &ldquo;A good thing I have such a sweet
face now. If this goes badly, they&rsquo;ll dress the pair of us for
dolls and sit us on a shelf to admire. Of course, we might have &lsquo;accidents&rsquo; instead. Dolls do get broken. Gareth Bryne
will have to find someone else to bully.&rdquo; She <em>really</em>
laughed at that.</p>

<p>Egwene felt considerable relief when the tentflap
bulged inward briefly, announcing someone who knew enough not to
enter where there was a ward. She really did not want to hear where
Siuan&rsquo;s humor went from there!</p>

<p>As soon as she released the ward, Sheriam stepped
inside, accompanied by a rush of air that seemed ten times as cold
as earlier. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time, Mother. Everything is ready.&rdquo; Her
tilted eyes were wide, and she licked her lips with the tip of her
tongue.</p>

<p>Siuan bounded to her feet and seized her cloak from
Egwene&rsquo;s cot, but she paused in the act of draping it on her
shoulders. &ldquo;I <em>have</em> sailed the Fingers of the Dragon in the
dark, you know,&rdquo; she said seriously. &ldquo;And netted a lionfish once,
with my father. It can be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sheriam frowned as Siuan darted out, letting in more
cold. &ldquo;Sometimes, I think,&rdquo; she began, but whatever she sometimes
thought, she did not share. &ldquo;Why are you doing this, Mother?&rdquo; she
asked instead. &ldquo;All of it, today at the lake, calling the Hall
tonight. Why did you have us spend all day yesterday talking about
Logain to everybody we met? I&rsquo;d think you might share it with
me. I <em>am</em> your Keeper. I <em>did</em> swear fealty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you what you need to know,&rdquo; Egwene said,
swinging her cloak around her shoulders. There was no need to say
that she trusted a forced oath only so far, even a sister&rsquo;s.
And Sheriam might find a reason to let a word slip into the wrong
ear despite that oath. After all, Aes Sedai were noted for finding
loopholes in what they had said. She did not really believe that
would happen, but just as with Lord Bryne, she could not take even
small chances unless she had to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to tell you,&rdquo; Sheriam said bitterly, &ldquo;I think
tomorrow Romanda or Lelaine will be your Keeper of the Chronicles,
and I&rsquo;ll be serving a penance for not warning the Hall. And I
think you might envy me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene nodded. All too possible. &ldquo;Shall we go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sun made a red dome on the treetops to the west,
and a lurid light shone off the snow. Servants marked Egwene&rsquo;s
passage along the deep paths with silent bows and curtsies. Their
faces were troubled or else blank; servants could pick up the moods
of those they served almost as quickly as Warders.</p>

<p>Not a sister was to be seen, at first, and then they
all were, in a great gathering three deep around a pavilion set up
in the only open space in the camp large enough, the area used by
sisters Skimming to the dovecotes in Salidar and Traveling back
with reports from the eyes-and-ears. A large much-mended piece of
heavy canvas, not a patch on the splendor of the canopy at the
lake, it had been a great deal of effort to set up. Most often in
the past two months, the Hall had convened much as they had
yesterday morning, or perhaps squeezed into one of the larger
tents. The pavilion had been erected only twice since leaving
Salidar. Both times for a trial.</p>

<p>Noticing Egwene and Sheriam&rsquo;s approach, sisters
in the back murmured to those ahead, and a gap opened to let them
through. Expressionless eyes watched the pair of them, giving not a
clue to whether the watching sisters knew or even suspected what
was happening. Not a clue to what they thought. Butterflies stirred
in Egwene&rsquo;s stomach. A rosebud. Calm.</p>

<p>She stepped onto the layered carpets, woven in bright
flowers and a dozen different patterns, and moved through the ring
of braziers set up around the canopy&rsquo;s rim, and Sheriam began.
&ldquo;She comes; she comes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; If she sounded a little less grand
than usual, a touch nervous, it was small wonder.</p>

<p>The polished benches and cloth-covered boxes from the
lake were in use again. They made a much more formal sight than the
mismatched gaggle of chairs that had been used previously, two
slanting lines of nine, grouped by threes; Green, Gray and Yellow
to one side, White, Brown and Blue to the other. At the wide end,
farthest from Egwene, stood the striped box and bench for the
Amyrlin Seat. Sitting there, she would be the focus of every eye,
very much aware that she was one facing eighteen. As well she had
not changed her clothes; every Sitter still wore her finery from
the lake, only adding her shawl. A rosebud. Calm.</p>

<p>One of the benches was empty, though only for a
moment longer. Delana came running in just as Sheriam finished her
litany. Looking breathless and flustered, the Gray Sitter scrambled
up to her seat, between Varilin and Kwamesa, with little of her
usual grace. She wore a sickly grin, and toyed nervously with the
firedrops around her neck. Anyone might have thought she was the
one on trial. Calm. No one was on trial. Yet.</p>

<p>Egwene started slowly across the carpets, between the
two rows, with Sheriam close behind, and Kwamesa stood. The light
of <em>saidar</em> suddenly shone around the dark slender woman,
youngest of the Sitters. Tonight there would be no skimping of the
formalities. &ldquo;What is brought before the Hall of the Tower is for
the Hall alone to consider,&rdquo; Kwamesa announced. &ldquo;Whosoever intrudes
unbidden, woman or man, initiate or outsider, whether they come in
peace or in anger, I will bind according to the law, to face the
law. Know that what I speak is true; it will and shall be
done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That formula was older than the oath against speaking
untruth, from a time when almost as many Amyrlins died by
assassination as by all other causes put together. Egwene continued
her measured tread. It was an effort not to touch her stole, for a
reminder. She tried to concentrate on the bench ahead.</p>

<p>Kwamesa resumed her seat, still shining with the
Power, and among the Whites, Aledrin rose, the glow surrounding her
as well. With her dark golden hair and big pale brown eyes, she was
quite lovely when she smiled, but tonight a stone had more
expression than she. &ldquo;There are those within earshot who are not of
the Hall,&rdquo; she said in a cool voice strong with the accents of
Tarabon. &ldquo;What is spoken in the Hall of the Tower is for the Hall
alone to hear, until and unless the Hall decides otherwise. I will
make us private. I will seal our words to our ears only.&rdquo; Weaving a
ward that walled the entire pavilion, she sat. There was a stir
among the sisters outside, who now must watch the Hall move in
utter silence.</p>

<p>Strange, that so much among Sitters depended on age,
when distinction by age was next to anathema among the rest of Aes
Sedai. <em>Could</em> Siuan have seen a pattern in the
Sitters&rsquo; ages? No. Focus. Calm, and focus.</p>

<p>Gripping the edges of her cloak, Egwene stepped up
onto the brightly striped box and turned. Lelaine was already on
her feet, blue-fringed shawl looped across her arms, and Romanda
was rising, without even waiting for Egwene to sit. She dared not
let either seize the tiller. &ldquo;I call a question before the Hall,&rdquo;
she said in a loud, firm voice. &ldquo;Who will stand to declare war
against the usurper Elaida do Avriny a&rsquo;Roihan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then she sat, throwing off her cloak and letting
it fall across the bench. Standing beside her on the carpets,
Sheriam appeared quite cool and collected, but she made a small
sound, almost a whimper. Egwene did not think anyone else had
heard. She hoped not.</p>

<p>There was a brief moment of shock, women frozen on
their seats, staring at her in amazement. Perhaps as much because
she had asked at all as what she had asked. No one put a question
before the Hall before sounding out the Sitters; it just was not
done, for practical reasons as much as tradition.</p>

<p>At last Lelaine spoke. &ldquo;We do not declare war on <em>
individuals</em>,&rdquo; she said in a dry voice. &ldquo;Not even on traitors
like Elaida. In any case, I call to shelve your question while we
deal with more immediate matters.&rdquo; She had had time to gather
herself since the ride back; her face was merely hard now, not
thunderous. Brushing blue-slashed skirts as if brushing away Elaida&mdash;or perhaps Egwene&mdash;she turned her attention to the
other Sitters. &ldquo;What brings us to sit tonight is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I was about
to say simple, but it isn&rsquo;t. Open the novice book? We would
have <em>grandmothers</em> clamoring to be tested. Remain here a
month? I hardly need list the difficulties, beginning with spending
half our gold without coming a foot nearer Tar Valon. And as for
not crossing into Andor&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My sister Lelaine, in her anxiety, has forgotten who
has the right to speak first,&rdquo; Romanda cut in smoothly. Her smile
managed to make Lelaine appear merry. Still, she took her time
adjusting her shawl just as she wanted, a woman with all the time
in the world. &ldquo;I have two questions to call before the Hall, and in
the second I will address Lelaine&rsquo;s concerns. Unfortunately
for her, my first question concerns Lelaine&rsquo;s own fitness to
continue in the Hall.&rdquo; Her smile widened without growing the
slightest bit warmer. Lelaine sat slowly, her scowl quite open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A question of war cannot be shelved,&rdquo; Egwene said in
a carrying tone. &ldquo;It must be answered before any question called
after it. That is the law.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quick, questioning glances passed between
Sitters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; Janya said finally. Squinting
thoughtfully, she twisted on her bench to address the woman next to
her. &ldquo;Takima, you remember everything you read, and I&rsquo;m sure I
remember you saying you had read the Law of War. Is that what it
says?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene held her breath. The White Tower had sent
soldiers to any number of wars over the last thousand years, but
always in response to a plea for help from at least two thrones,
and it always had been their war, not the Tower&rsquo;s. The last
time the Tower itself actually declared war had been against Artur
Hawkwing. Siuan said that now only a few librarians knew much more
than that there <em>was</em> a Law of War.</p>

<p>Short, with long dark hair to her waist and skin the
color of aged ivory, Takima often reminded people of a bird,
tilting her head in thought. Now she looked like a bird that wanted
to take flight, shifting on her seat, adjusting her shawl,
unnecessarily straightening her cap of pearls and sapphires. &ldquo;It
is,&rdquo; she said finally, and clamped her mouth shut.</p>

<p>Egwene quietly started breathing again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems,&rdquo; Romanda said in a clipped tone, &ldquo;that
Siuan Sanche has been teaching you well. Mother. How speak you in
support of declaring war? On a woman.&rdquo; She sounded as if she were
trying to push something disagreeable out of her way, and she
dropped onto her seat waiting for it to depart.</p>

<p>Egwene nodded graciously anyway, and rose. She met
the Sitters&rsquo; gazes one by one, levelly, firmly. Takima avoided
her eyes. Light, the woman knew! But she had not said anything.
Would she hold silent long enough? It was too late to change
plans.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today we find ourselves confronted by an army, led
by people who doubt us. That army would not be there otherwise.&rdquo;
Egwene wanted to put passion into her voice, to let it burst out,
but Siuan had advised utter coolness, and finally she had agreed.
They needed to see a woman in control of herself, not a girl being
ridden by her heart. The words came from her heart, though. &ldquo;You
heard Arathelle say she did not want to become entangled in Aes
Sedai affairs. Yet they were willing to bring an army into Murandy
and stand in our way. Because they are not certain who we are, or
what we are about. Did any of you feel that they truly believe you
are Sitters?&rdquo; Malind, round-faced and fierce-eyed, shifted on her
bench among the Greens, and so did Salita, twitching her
yellow-fringed shawl, though her dark face managed to hide any
expression. Berana, another Sitter chosen in Salidar, frowned
thoughtfully. Egwene did not mention the reaction to her as
Amyrlin; if that thought was not already in their heads, she did
not want to plant it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve listed Elaida&rsquo;s crimes to countless
nobles,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve told them we intend to remove
her. But they doubt. They think that maybe&mdash;maybe&mdash;we
are what we say. And maybe there&rsquo;s a trick in our words.
Perhaps we are only Elaida&rsquo;s hand, weaving some elaborate
scheme. Doubt leaves people floundering. Doubt gave Pelivar and
Arathelle the nerve to stand before Aes Sedai and say, &lsquo;You
cannot go further.&rsquo; Who else will stand in our way, or
interfere, because they aren&rsquo;t certain, and uncertainty leads
them to act in a cloud of confusion? There&rsquo;s only one way for
us to dispel their confusion. We have already done everything else.
Once we declare ourselves at war with Elaida, there can be no
doubts. I don&rsquo;t say that Arathelle and Pelivar and Aemlyn will
march away as soon as we do so, but they and everyone else will
know who we are. No one will dare again to show doubt so openly
when you say you are the Hall of the Tower. No one will dare stand
in our way, meddling in the affairs of the Tower through
uncertainty and ignorance. We have walked to the door and put our
hands on the latch. If you are afraid to walk through, then you all
but ask the world to believe that you are nothing but Elaida&rsquo;s
puppets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sat, surprised at how calm she felt. Beyond the
two rows of Sitters, sisters outside stirred, putting their heads
together. She could imagine the excited murmurs that Aledrin&rsquo;s
ward blocked off. Now if only Takima kept her mouth shut long
enough.</p>

<p>Romanda grunted impatiently, and stood only long
enough to say, &ldquo;Who stands for declaring war against Elaida?&rdquo; Her
gaze returned to Lelaine, and her cold, smug smile returned. It was
clear what she considered important, once this nonsense was done
with.</p>

<p>Janya rose immediately, the long brown fringe on her
shawl swaying. &ldquo;We might as well,&rdquo; she said. She was not supposed
to speak, but her set jaw and sharp gaze dared anyone to call her
down. She was not normally so forceful, but as usual, her words
nearly tripped over one another. &ldquo;Mending what the world knows
won&rsquo;t be any harder than it is for this. Well? Well? I
don&rsquo;t see the point of waiting.&rdquo; On the other side of Takima,
Escaralde nodded and stood.</p>

<p>Moria all but bounded to her feet, frowning down at
Lyrelle, who gathered her skirts as if to rise, then hesitated and
looked at Lelaine questioningly. Lelaine was too busy frowning
across the carpets at Romanda to notice.</p>

<p>Among the Greens, Samalin and Malind stood together,
and Faiselle looked up with a jerk. A stocky, copper-skinned
Domani, Faiselle was not a woman startled by much, but she looked
startled now, her square face swinging wide-eyed from Samalin to
Malind and back.</p>

<p>Salita rose, carefully adjusting the yellow fringe of
her shawl and just as carefully avoiding Romanda&rsquo;s sudden
frown. Kwamesa stood, and then Aledrin, drawing Berana up by her
sleeve. Delana twisted completely around on her bench, peering at
the sisters outside. Even in silence the spectators&rsquo;
excitement communicated itself in constant shifting, heads going
together, eyes darting toward the Sitters. Delana rose slowly, both
hands pressed to her middle, looking ready to sick up on the spot.
Takima grimaced and stared at her hands on her knees. Saroiya
studied the other two White Sitters, tugging at her ear the way she
did when deep in thought. But no one else moved to stand.</p>

<p>Egwene felt bile rising in her own throat. Ten. Just
ten. She had been so sure. Siuan had been so sure. Logain alone
should have been enough, given their ignorance of the law involved.
Pelivar&rsquo;s army and Arathelle refusing to admit that they <em>
were</em> Sitters should have primed them like a pump.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the love of the Light!&rdquo; Moria burst out.
Rounding on Lyrelle and Lelaine, she planted her fists on her hips.
If Janya&rsquo;s speaking had gone against custom, this tied it in a
knot. Displays of anger were strictly forbidden in the Hall, but
Moria&rsquo;s eyes blazed, and her Illianer accent was thick with
it. &ldquo;Why do you wait? Elaida did steal the stole and the staff!
Elaida&rsquo;s Ajah did make Logain a false Dragon, and only the
Light knows how many other men! No woman in the history of the
Tower did ever deserve this declaration more! Stand, or hold silent
from now about your <em>resolve</em> to remove her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lelaine did not quite stare, but by her expression
you might have thought she had found herself attacked by a sparrow.
&ldquo;This is hardly worth a vote, Moria,&rdquo; she said in a tight voice.
&ldquo;We will speak later about decorum, you and I. Still, if you need a
demonstration of resolve&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; With a sharp sniff, she rose, and
gave a jerk of her head that pulled Lyrelle to her feet like
strings. Lelaine seemed surprised that it did not pull up Faiselle
and Takima, too.</p>

<p>Far from standing, Takima grunted as if struck.
Disbelief bright on her face, she ran her eyes along the women on
their feet, obviously counting. And then did it again. Takima, who
remembered <em>everything</em> the first time.</p>

<p>Egwene breathed deep in relief. It was done. She
could hardly believe. After a moment, she cleared her throat, and
Sheriam actually jumped.</p>

<p>Green eyes as big as teacups, the Keeper cleared her
throat, too. &ldquo;The lesser consensus standing, war is declared
against Elaida do Avriny a&rsquo;Roihan.&rdquo; Her voice was none too
steady, but it sufficed. &ldquo;In the interest of unity, I ask for the
greater consensus to stand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faiselle half-moved, then clenched her hands in her
lap. Saroiya opened her mouth, then closed it without speaking, her
face troubled. No one else stirred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t get it,&rdquo; Romanda said flatly. The
sneer she directed across the pavilion at Lelaine was as good as a
statement of why she, at least, would not stand. &ldquo;Now that little
business is finished, we can go on with&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we can,&rdquo; Egwene cut in. &ldquo;Takima,
what does the Law of War say about the Amyrlin Seat?&rdquo; Romanda was
left with her mouth hanging open.</p>

<p>Takima&rsquo;s lips writhed. The diminutive Brown
looked more than ever a bird wishing to take flight. &ldquo;The Law&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; she began, then took a deep breath and sat up straight. &ldquo;The Law
of War states, &lsquo;As one set of hands must guide a sword, so the
Amyrlin Seat shall direct and prosecute the war by decree. She
shall seek the advice of the Hall of the Tower, but the Hall shall
carry out her decrees with all possible speed, and for the sake of
unity, they shall&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; She faltered, and had to visibly force
herself to go on. &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;they shall and must approve any decree of
the Amyrlin Seat regarding prosecution of the war with the greater
consensus.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A long silence stretched. Every eye seemed to be
goggling. Turning abruptly, Delana vomited onto the carpets behind
her bench. Kwamesa and Salita both climbed down and started toward
her, but she waved them off, plucking a scarf from her sleeve to
wipe her mouth. Magla and Saroiya and several others still seated
looked as though they might follow her example. No others who had
been chosen in Salidar, though. Romanda appeared ready to bite
through a nail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very clever,&rdquo; Lelaine said at last in clipped tones,
and after a deliberate pause, added, &ldquo;Mother. Will you tell us what
the great wisdom of your vast experience tells you to do? About the
war, I mean. I want to make myself clear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me make myself clear, too,&rdquo; Egwene said coldly.
Leaning forward, she fixed the Blue Sitter sternly. &ldquo;A certain
degree of respect is <em>required</em> toward the Amyrlin Seat, and
from now on, I <em>will</em> have it, daughter. This is no time for
me to have to unchair you and name a penance.&rdquo; Lelaine&rsquo;s eyes
crept wider and wider with shock. Had the woman really believed
everything would continue as before? Or after so long not daring to
show more than the tiniest backbone, had Lelaine simply believed
she had none? Egwene really did not want to unchair her; the Blues
would almost certainly return the woman, and she still had to deal
with the Hall on matters that could not be convincingly disguised
as part of the war against Elaida.</p>

<p>From the corner of her eye, she saw a smile pass
across Romanda&rsquo;s lips at seeing Lelaine set down. Small profit
if all she did was raise Romanda&rsquo;s stock with the others.
&ldquo;That holds for everyone, Romanda,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If need be, Tiana
can find two birches as easily as one.&rdquo; Romanda&rsquo;s smile
vanished abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I may speak, Mother,&rdquo; Takima said, rising slowly.
She attempted a smile, but she still looked decidedly ill. &ldquo;I
myself think you have begun well. There may be benefits to stopping
here a month. Or longer.&rdquo; Romanda&rsquo;s head jerked around to
stare at her, but for once, Takima did not appear to notice.
&ldquo;Wintering here, we can avoid worse weather further north, and also
plan carefully&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an end to delays, daughter,&rdquo; Egwene cut
in. &ldquo;No more dragging our feet.&rdquo; Would she be another Gerra, or
another Shein? Either was still possible. &ldquo;In one month, we will
Travel from here.&rdquo; No; she was Egwene al&rsquo;Vere, and whatever
the secret histories would say of her faults and virtues, the Light
only knew, but they would be hers, not copies of some other
woman&rsquo;s. &ldquo;In one month, we will begin the siege of Tar
Valon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This time, the silence was broken only by the sound
of Takima weeping.</p>
