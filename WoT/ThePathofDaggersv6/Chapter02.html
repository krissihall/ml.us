<h4><em>Unweaving</em></h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">E</span>layne
stepped to one side as soon as she was through
the gateway, but Nynaeve trampled across the clearing, kicking up
brown grasshoppers from the dead grass and peering this way and
that for evidence of the Warders. Of one Warder, anyway. A bright
red bird flashed across the clearing and was gone. Nothing else
moved except the sisters; a squirrel barked somewhere in the mostly
leafless trees, and then there was silence. To Elayne it seemed
impossible those three could have passed this way without leaving
paths as wide as that behind Nynaeve, yet she could not make out
any sign that they had been there at all.</p>

<p>She sensed Birgitte somewhere off to her left,
roughly southwest she thought, and feeling quite content, clearly
in no immediate danger. Careane, part of a protective circle
gathered around Sareitha and the Bowl, cocked her head almost as if
listening. Apparently her Cieryl was to the southeast. Which meant
Lan was north. Oddly enough, north was the direction Nynaeve had
settled down to watch, all the while muttering under her breath.
Perhaps being married had created some sense of him in her. More
likely, she had noticed a track that escaped Elayne. Nynaeve was as
skilled at woodscraft as she was with herbs.</p>

<p>From where Elayne stood at first, Aviendha was
clearly visible through the gateway, studying the palace rooftops
as if she expected an ambush. By her stance, she could have been
carrying spears, ready to leap into battle in her riding dress. She
made Elayne smile, hiding how distressed she was about her problems
with the gateway, so much braver than she herself. But at the same
time she could not help worrying. Aviendha <em>was</em> brave, and
no one Elayne knew was better able to keep her head. She also might
decide that <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em> required her to fight when
there was no chance except in running. The light around her shone
so brightly it was obvious she could not draw much more of <em>
saidar</em>. If one of the Forsaken did appear&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>I should have stayed with her</em>. Elayne
rejected the thought immediately. Whatever excuse she gave,
Aviendha would know the truth, and she was touchy as a man,
sometimes. Most of the time. Especially when it bore upon her
honor. With a sigh, Elayne let the Atha&rsquo;an Miere crowd her
further from the gateway as they filed through. She stayed close
enough to hear any shout on the other side, though. Close enough to
leap to Aviendha&rsquo;s aid in a heartbeat. And for another
reason.</p>

<p>The Windfinders came through in order of rank,
striving to keep their faces smooth, but even Renaile relaxed tight
shoulders once her bare feet were beating down the tall brown
grass. Some gave a little shiver, quickly suppressed, or glanced
back with round eyes at the opening hanging in midair. One and all,
they stared at Elayne suspiciously as they stepped by her, and two
or three opened their mouths, perhaps to ask what she was doing,
perhaps to ask&mdash;or tell&mdash;her to move. She was just as
glad that they hurried on in obedience to Renaile&rsquo;s curt
urgings. They would have their chance to tell Aes Sedai what to do
soon enough; it did not have to start with her.</p>

<p>That thought made her stomach sink, and the number of
them made her shake her head. They had the knowledge of weather to
use the Bowl properly, yet even Renaile agreed&mdash;if
reluctantly&mdash;that the more Power directed through the Bowl,
the better the chances of being able to heal the weather. It must
be directed with a precision impossible except for one woman alone
or a circle, though. A full circle of thirteen it had to be. That
thirteen certainly would include Nynaeve and Aviendha and Elayne
herself, and probably a few of the Kin, but Renaile plainly
intended to jump on the part of the bargain that said they would be
allowed to learn any abilities the Aes Sedai could teach. The
gateway had been the first, and forming a circle would be the
second. A wonder she had not brought every Windfinder in the
harbor. Imagine trying to deal with three or four hundred of these
women! Elayne offered a small prayer of thanks that there were only
twenty.</p>

<p>She was not standing there to count them, though. As
each Windfinder passed, barely more than a pace away, she let
herself feel the woman&rsquo;s strength in the Power. Earlier there
had been time to get close enough to only a handful, what with all
the trouble of convincing Renaile to come at all. Apparently
achieving rank among the Windfinders had nothing to with either age
or strength; Renaile was far from the strongest even in the first
three or four, while one woman toward the rear, Senine, had
weathered cheeks and thickly grayed hair. Strangely, by the marks
in her ears it seemed that Senine might once have worn more than
six earrings, and thicker ones than she did now.</p>

<p>Elayne sorted and stored away faces and the names she
knew with a growing sense of complacency. The Windfinders might
have secured an upper hand of sorts, and she and Nynaeve might be
in deep trouble, very deep, with both Egwene and the Hall of the
Tower once the terms of their bargain became known, but none of
these women would stand particularly high among Aes Sedai.
Certainly not low, but not high. She told herself not to feel smug&mdash;it changed nothing in what they had agreed&mdash;yet it was
very hard not to. These were the best the Atha&rsquo;an could
produce, after all. Here in Ebou Dar, anyway. And if they had been
Aes Sedai, every one of them, from Kurin, with her stony black
stare, to Renaile herself, would have listened when she spoke and
stood when she entered a room. If they were Aes Sedai and behaving
as they should.</p>

<p>And then the end of the line appeared, and she gave a
start as a young Windfinder off one of the smaller ships passed
her, a round-cheeked woman called Rainyn, in plain blue silks, with
barely a half-dozen ornaments hanging from her nose chain. The two
apprentices, boyishly slim Talaan and big-eyed Metarra, scurried at
the very tail with harried expressions. They had not earned the
nose ring yet, much less the chain, and only a single thin gold
earring in the left ear balanced the three in the right. Her eyes
followed the three of them just short of staring. Perhaps not short
of it, at that.</p>

<p>The Atha&rsquo;an Miere clustered with Renaile again,
most, like her, glaring hungrily at the Aes Sedai and the Bowl. The
last three women stood at the rear, the apprentices with the air of
those uncertain whether they had a right to be there at all, Rainyn
folding her arms in imitation of Renaile, yet doing little better
than the other two. The Windfinder on a darter, the least of the
Sea Folk vessels, likely seldom found herself in company with the
Windfinder to her clan Wavemistress, not to mention the Windfinder
to the Mistress of the Ships. Rainyn was easily as strong as
Lelaine or Romanda, and Metarra on a level with Elayne herself,
while Talaan&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Talaan, so meek in her red linen blouse, with
eyes that seemed permanently downcast, came very close to Nynaeve.
Very close. More, Elayne knew she herself had not yet reached her
full potential, and neither had Nynaeve. How close were Metarra and
Talaan? She had grown accustomed to knowing that only Nynaeve and
the Forsaken were stronger than she. Well, Egwene, but she had been
forced, and her own potential, and Aviendha&rsquo;s, matched
Egwene&rsquo;s. <em>So much for complacency</em>, she told herself
ruefully. Lini would have said it was what she deserved for taking
things for granted.</p>

<p>Laughing softly at herself, Elayne turned back to
check on Aviendha, but the Knitting Circle stood rooted to one spot
in front of the gateway, twitching at cold stares from Careane and
Sareitha. All but Sumeko, and she did not move away either for all
that she had met the sisters&rsquo; gazes. Kirstian appeared ready
to burst into tears.</p>

<p>Suppressing a sigh, Elayne herded the Kinswomen out
of the way of the stable folk waiting to bring the horses through.
The Knitting Circle went along like sheep&mdash;she was the
shepherd, Merilille and the rest the wolves&mdash;and they would
have moved faster if not for Ispan.</p>

<p>Famelle, one of only four among the Knitting Circle
without a touch of gray or white in her hair, and Eldase, a
fierce-eyed woman when she was not looking at an Aes Sedai, held
Ispan by the arms. They could not seem to decide between holding
her firmly enough to keep her upright and not clutching her too
tightly, with the result that the Black sister moved in a bobbing
fashion, sagging halfway to her knees when they loosened their
grips, then pulled back up just before she fell completely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Famelle kept murmuring to
Ispan with a faint Taraboner accent. &ldquo;Oh, I am sorry, Aes Sedai.&rdquo;
Eldase winced and gave a little moan every time Ispan stumbled.
Just as if Ispan had not helped murder two of their number and the
Light alone knew how many others. They were fussing over a woman
who was going to die. The killings in the White Tower that Ispan
had conspired at were enough to condemn her by themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take her over there somewhere,&rdquo; Elayne told them,
waving away from the gateway into the clearing. They obeyed,
bobbing curtsies and nearly dropping Ispan, murmuring apologies to
Elayne and to the hooded prisoner. Reanne and the rest scurried
along, anxiously eyeing the sisters around Merilille.</p>

<p>Almost immediately the war of glares started up
again, the Aes Sedai at the Kinswomen, the Knitting Circle at the
Windfinders, and the Atha&rsquo;an Miere at anybody their eyes fell
on. Elayne clamped her teeth shut. She was not going to shout at
them. Nynaeve always got better results with yells, anyway. But she
did want to shake some sense into every one of them, shake them
until their teeth rattled. Including Nynaeve, who was supposed to
be getting everyone organized instead of staring into the trees.
But what if it had been Rand who was going to die unless she could
find a way to save him?</p>

<p>Suddenly tears trembled on the edge of falling,
stinging her eyes. Rand <em>was</em> going to die, and there was
nothing she could do to stop it. <em>Peel the apple in your hand,
girl, not the one on the tree</em>, Lini&rsquo;s thin voice seemed
to whisper in her ear. <em>Tears are for after; they just waste
time before</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Lini,&rdquo; Elayne murmured. Her old nurse was
an irritating woman sometimes, never admitting that any of her
charges had really grown up, but her advice was always good. Just
because Nynaeve was slacking her duties was no reason for Elayne to
slack hers.</p>

<p>Servants had started trotting horses through right on
the heels of the Knitting Circle, beginning with the packhorses.
None of those first animals carried anything so frivolous as
clothes. They could walk if the riding horses needed to be
abandoned on the other side of the gateway, and wear what they
stood up in if the rest of the pack animals had to be left behind,
but what was on those first horses could not be left for the
Forsaken. Elayne motioned the leather-cheeked woman leading the
very first to follow her aside, out of the way of the others.</p>

<p>Untying and tossing back the stiff canvas cover on
one of the wide wicker panniers revealed a great heap of what
appeared to be rubbish stuffed in every which way, right up to the
top, some of it wrapped in cloth that was falling to pieces. The
greater part of it probably was rubbish. Embracing <em>saidar</em>,
Elayne began sorting. A rusted breastplate quickly went onto the
ground, along with a broken table leg, a cracked platter, a badly
dented pewter pitcher, and a bolt of rotted, unidentifiable cloth
that almost broke apart in her hands.</p>

<p>The storeroom where they found the Bowl of the Winds
had been stuffed full, things that should have been on a refuse
heap jumbled in with more objects of the Power than just the Bowl,
some in beetle-riddled casks or chests, some carelessly stacked.
For hundreds and hundreds of years the Kin had hidden away all
things they found that were connected to the Power, fearful of
using them and fearful of delivering them to Aes Sedai. Until that
very morning. This was the first chance Elayne had had to see what
was worth keeping. The Light send that the Darkfriends had not
gotten away with anything important; they had taken some, but
certainly less than a quarter of what the room had held, rubbish
included. The Light send she found something they could use. People
had died to bring these things out of the Rahad.</p>

<p>She did not channel, just held the Power as she
lifted each item. A chipped clay cup, three broken plates, a
child&rsquo;s moth-eaten dress, and an old boot with a hole worn
through the side all fell to the ground. A stone carving a little
larger than her hand&mdash;it <em>felt</em> like stone; it <em>
might</em> have been a carving, though it did not exactly look
carved, for some reason&mdash;all deep blue curves vaguely like
roots. It seemed to warm faintly at her touch; it held a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;resonance&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to <em>saidar</em>. That was the closest word she
could think of. What it was meant to do, she had no idea, but it
was a <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> without any doubt. It went on the
other side of her, away from the pile of rubbish.</p>

<p>The heap of refuse continued to grow, but so did the
other, if more slowly, things that had nothing in common except the
faint warmth and the sense of echoing the Power. A small box that
felt like ivory, covered in wavering red and green stripes; she set
it down carefully without opening the hinged lid. You could never
tell what might trigger a <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. A black rod no
thicker than her little finger, a pace in length, stiff yet so
flexible she thought she could have doubled it into a circle. A
tiny stoppered vial that might have been crystal, with a dark red
liquid inside. The figure of a stout, bearded man with a jolly
smile, holding a book; two feet tall, it appeared to be
age-darkened bronze and took both of her hands to move. Other
things. Most was trash, though. And none was what she truly wanted.
Not yet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this the time to be doing that?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked.
She straightened hastily from the small cluster of <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, grimacing and rubbing her hand on her skirt.
&ldquo;That rod feels like&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;pain,&rdquo; she muttered. The hard-faced
woman holding the packhorse&rsquo;s head blinked at the rod and
edged away.</p>

<p>Elayne eyed the rod&mdash;Nynaeve&rsquo;s occasional
impressions about objects she touched could be useful&mdash;but
she did not stop sorting. There had been too much pain lately to
need any more, surely. Not that what Nynaeve sensed was always that
straightforward. The rod might have been present when a great deal
of pain was caused without being the cause in itself. The pannier
was almost empty; some of what was on the other side of the horse
would have to be shifted to balance the weight. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s an
<em>angreal</em> in this somewhere, Nynaeve, I would like to find
it before Moghedien taps one of us on the shoulder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve grunted sourly, but she peered into the
wicker basket.</p>

<p>Dropping another table leg&mdash;that made <em>
three</em>, none of which matched&mdash;Elayne spared a glance for
the clearing. All of the packhorses were out, and the mounts were
coming through the gateway, now, filling the open space between the
trees with bustle and confusion. Merilille and the other Aes Sedai
already sat their saddles, barely concealing their impatience to be
off, while Pol fussed hurriedly with her mistress&rsquo;s
saddlebags, but the Windfinders&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Graceful afoot, graceful on their ships, they were
unused to horses. Renaile was trying to mount from the wrong side,
and the gentle bay mare chosen for her danced slow circles around
the liveried man who was gripping the bridle with one hand while
tugging his hair in frustration with the other and vainly trying to
correct the Windfinder. Two of the stablewomen were attempting to
hoist Dorile, who served the Wavemistress of Clan Somarin, into her
saddle, while a third, holding the gray&rsquo;s head, wore the tight
face of someone trying not to laugh. Rainyn was on the back of a
leggy brown gelding, but somehow without either foot in the
stirrups or the reins in her hands and having considerable trouble
finding any of them. And those three seemed to be having the
easiest time of it. Horses whinnied and danced and rolled their
eyes, and Windfinders shouted curses in voices that could have been
heard over a gale. One of them knocked a serving man flat with her
fist, and three more stable folk were trying to catch mounts that
had gotten free.</p>

<p>There was also what she had expected to see, if
Nynaeve was no longer keeping her private watch. Lan stood by his
black warhorse, Mandarb, dividing his gaze between the treeline,
the gateway, and Nynaeve. Birgitte came striding out of the woods
shaking her head, and a moment later, Cieryl, trotted from the
trees, but with no sense of urgency. There was nothing out there to
threaten or inconvenience them.</p>

<p>Nynaeve was watching her, eyebrows raised high.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say anything,&rdquo; Elayne said. Her hand
closed on something small, wrapped in rotting cloth that might have
been white once. Or brown. She knew immediately what was
inside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good thing for you,&rdquo; Nynaeve grumbled, not quite
far enough under her breath. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t abide women who poke
their noses into other people&rsquo;s business.&rdquo; Elayne let it pass
without so much as a start; she was proud that she did not have to
bite her tongue.</p>

<p>Stripping away the decayed cloth revealed a small
amber brooch in the shape of a turtle. It looked like amber,
anyway, and it might been amber once, but when she opened herself
to the Source through it, <em>saidar</em> rushed into her, a
torrent compared to what she could draw safely on her own. Not a
strong <em>angreal</em>, but far better than nothing. With it, she
could handle twice as much of the Power as Nynaeve, and Nynaeve
herself would do better still. Releasing the extra flow of <em>
saidar</em>, she slipped the brooch into her belt pouch with a
smile of delight and went back to searching. Where there was one,
there might be more. And now that she had one to study, she might
be able to reason out how to <em>make</em> an <em>angreal</em>.
That was something she had wished for. It was all she could do not
to take the brooch out again and begin probing it right there.</p>

<p>Vandene had been eyeing Nynaeve and her for some
time, and now she heeled her slab-sided gelding over to them and
dismounted. The groom at the packhorse&rsquo;s head managed a decent
if awkward curtsy, more than she had for Elayne or Nynaeve.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re being careful,&rdquo; Vandene said to Elayne, &ldquo;and
that&rsquo;s very good. But it might be better to leave these things
alone until they&rsquo;re in the Tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s mouth tightened. In the Tower? Until
they could be examined by someone else, was what she meant. Someone
older and supposedly more experienced. &ldquo;I <em>do</em> know what
I&rsquo;m doing, Vandene. I have <em>made ter&rsquo;angreal</em>,
after all. Nobody else living has done <em>that</em>.&rdquo; She had
taught the basics to some sisters, but no one had managed the trick
of it by the time she left for Ebou Dar.</p>

<p>The older Green nodded, flipping her reins idly
against the palm of her riding glove. &ldquo;Martine Janata also knew
what she was doing, so I understand,&rdquo; she said casually. &ldquo;She was
the last sister to really make a business of studying <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. She did it for over forty years, almost from
the time she reached the shawl. She was careful, too, so I was
told. Then one day, Martine&rsquo;s maid found her unconscious on
the floor of her sitting room. Burned out.&rdquo; Even in a
conversational tone, those words were a sharp slap. Vandene&rsquo;s
voice did not alter a hair, though. &ldquo;Her Warder was dead from the
shock. Not unusual in cases like that. When Martine came to, three
days later, she couldn&rsquo;t recall what she had been working
with. She couldn&rsquo;t remember the preceding week at all. That
was more than twenty-five years ago, and no one since has had the
nerve to touch any of the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> that were in
her rooms. Her notes mentioned every last one, and everything she
had discovered was innocuous, innocent, even frivolous, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;
Vandene shrugged. &ldquo;She found something she wasn&rsquo;t
expecting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne peeked at Birgitte, and found Birgitte looking
back at her. She did not need to see the worried frown on the other
woman&rsquo;s face; it was mirrored in her mind, in the small patch
of her mind that <em>was</em> Birgitte and in the rest. Birgitte
felt her worry, and she felt Birgitte&rsquo;s, until sometimes it
was hard to say which was which. She risked more than herself. But
she <em>did</em> know what she was doing. More than anyone else
there, at least. And even if none of the Forsaken appeared, they
<em>needed</em> all the <em>angreal</em> she could find.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happened to Martine?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked quietly.
&ldquo;Afterward, I mean.&rdquo; She could seldom hear of anyone being hurt
without wanting to Heal them; she wanted to Heal everything.</p>

<p>Vandene grimaced. She might have been the one to
bring up Martine, but Aes Sedai did not like talking about women
who had been burned out or stilled. They did not like remembering
them. &ldquo;She vanished once she was well enough to slip out of the
Tower,&rdquo; she said hurriedly. &ldquo;The important thing to remember is
that she was cautious. I never met her, but I&rsquo;ve been told she
treated every <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> as if she had no idea what
it might do next, even the one that makes the cloth for
Warders&rsquo; cloaks, and nobody has ever been able to make that do
anything else. She was careful, and it did her no good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve laid an arm across the nearly empty pannier.
&ldquo;Maybe you really should,&rdquo; she began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>No-o-o-o!</em>&ldquo; Merilille shrieked.</p>

<p>Elayne spun, instinctively opening herself through
the <em>angreal</em> again, only half conscious of <em>saidar</em>
flooding into Nynaeve and Vandene. The glow of the Power sprang up
around every woman in the clearing who could embrace the Source.
Merilille was straining forward in her saddle, eyes bulging, one
hand reaching toward the gateway. Elayne frowned. There was nothing
there except Aviendha, and the last four Warders, startled in the
middle of walking away, searching for the threat with swords
half-drawn. Then she realized what Aviendha was doing and nearly
lost <em>saidar</em> in her shock.</p>

<p>The gateway trembled as Aviendha carefully picked
apart the weave that had made it. It shivered and flexed, the edges
wavering. The last flows came loose, and instead of winking out,
the opening shimmered, the view through it of the courtyard fading
away until it evaporated like mist in the sun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is impossible!&rdquo; Renaile said incredulously. An
astonished murmur of agreement broke out among the Windfinders. The
Kinswomen gaped at Aviendha, mouths working soundlessly.</p>

<p>Elayne nodded slowly in spite of herself. Clearly it
was possible, but one of the first things she had been told as a
novice was that never, ever, under any circumstances was she to try
what Aviendha had just done. Picking apart a weave, any weave,
rather than simply letting it dissipate, could not be done, she had
been told, not without inevitable disaster. Inevitable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You fool girl!&rdquo; Vandene snapped, her face a
thunderhead. She strode toward Aviendha dragging her gelding
behind. &ldquo;Do you realize what you almost did? One slip&mdash;one!&mdash;and there&rsquo;s no saying what the weave will snap into, or
what it will do! You could have completely destroyed everything for
a hundred paces! Five hundred! Everything! You could have burned
yourself out and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was necessary,&rdquo; Aviendha cut in. A babble erupted
from the mounted Aes Sedai crowding around her and Vandene, but she
glared at them and raised her voice over theirs. &ldquo;I know the
dangers, Vandene Namelle, but it was necessary. Is this another
thing you Aes Sedai cannot do? The Wise Ones say any woman can
learn, if she is taught, some women more and some less, but any
woman, if she can pick out embroidery.&rdquo; She did not quite sneer.
Not quite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is <em>not</em> embroidery, girl!&rdquo;
Merilille&rsquo;s voice was deep winter ice. &ldquo;Whatever so-called
training you received among your people, you cannot possibly know
what you are <em>playing</em> with! You will promise me&mdash;swear to me!&mdash;that you will never do this again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her name should be in the novice book,&rdquo; Sareitha
said firmly, glaring across the Bowl still held firmly to her
bosom. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always said it. She should be entered in the
book.&rdquo; Careane nodded, her stern gaze measuring Aviendha for a
novice dress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That might not be necessary for the moment,&rdquo; Adeleas
told Aviendha, leaning forward in her saddle, &ldquo;but you must let
yourself be guided by us.&rdquo; The Brown sister&rsquo;s tone was much
milder than the others&rsquo;, yet she was not making a
suggestion.</p>

<p>A month or so earlier, Aviendha might have begun to
wilt under all that Aes Sedai disapproval, but not now. Elayne
hurriedly pushed in among the horses before her friend decided to
draw the knife she was fondling. Or to do something worse. &ldquo;Maybe
somebody should ask <em>why</em> she thought it was necessary,&rdquo; she
said, slipping an arm around Aviendha&rsquo;s shoulders as much to
keep her arms at her sides as for comfort.</p>

<p>Aviendha did not quite include her in the exasperated
look she gave the other sisters. &ldquo;This leaves no residue,&rdquo; she said
patiently. Too patiently. &ldquo;The residues of a weave this large might
be read two days from now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Merilille snorted, a very strong sound to come from
that slight body. &ldquo;That is a rare Talent, girl. Neither Teslyn nor
Joline has it. Or do you Aiel wilders all learn that as well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Few can do it,&rdquo; Aviendha admitted calmly. &ldquo;But I
can.&rdquo; That produced a different sort of stare, from Elayne as well;
it was a <em>very</em> rare Talent. She did not seem to notice. &ldquo;Do
<em>you</em> claim that none of the Shadowsouled can?&rdquo; she went on.
The tightness of her shoulder under Elayne&rsquo;s hand said she was
not so cool as she pretended. &ldquo;Are you such fools that you leave
tracks for your enemies to follow? Any who could read the residues
could make a gateway to this spot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That would have taken great dexterity, very great
dexterity, but the suggestion was enough to leave Merilille
blinking. Adeleas opened her mouth, then closed it without
speaking, and Vandene frowned thoughtfully. Sareitha simply looked
worried. Who could say what Talents the Forsaken had, what
skill?</p>

<p>Strangely, all the fierceness drained out of
Aviendha. Her eyes fell, her shoulders loosened. &ldquo;Perhaps I should
not have taken the risk,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;With that man watching me,
I could not think clearly, and when he disappeared&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; A little
of her spirit returned, but not a great deal. &ldquo;I do not think a man
could read my weaves,&rdquo; she said to Elayne, &ldquo;but if he was one of
the Shadowsouled, or even the <em>gholam</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The
Shadowsouled know more than any of us. If I was wrong, I have great
<em>toh</em>. But I do not think I was. I do not think it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What man?&rdquo; Nynaeve demanded. Her hat had been
knocked askew in pushing among the horses, and that, with the tight
frown she directed at everyone impartially, made her look ready for
a fight. Perhaps she was. Careane&rsquo;s gelding accidentally
nudged her with a shoulder, and she swatted the blue dun&rsquo;s
nose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A servant,&rdquo; Merilille said dismissively. &ldquo;Whatever
orders Tylin gave, Altaran servants are an independent lot. Or
perhaps her son; that boy is too curious by half.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sisters around her nodded, and Careane said, &ldquo;One
of the Forsaken would hardly have stood and watched. You said so
yourself.&rdquo; She was patting her gelding&rsquo;s neck and frowning
accusingly at Nynaeve&mdash;Careane was one of those who gave her
horse the sort of affection most people reserved for infants&mdash;she was frowning at Nynaeve, and Nynaeve took the words for her,
too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was a servant, and maybe it was Beslan.
Maybe.&rdquo; Nynaeve&rsquo;s sniff said she did not believe it. Or that
she wanted them to believe she did not; she could tell you to your
face that you were a blind idiot, yet let anyone else say it, and
she would defend you until she went hoarse. Of course, she did not
seem ready to decide whether she liked Aviendha, but she definitely
did not like the older Aes Sedai. She tugged her hat almost
straight, and her frown swept across them, then started over.
&ldquo;Whether it was Beslan or the Dark One, there&rsquo;s no call to
stand here all day. We need to get ready and move on to the farm.
Well? Move!&rdquo; She clapped her hands sharply, and even Vandene gave a
little start.</p>

<p>There was little preparation left to do when the
sisters moved their horses away. Lan and the other Warders had not
sat on their heels once they realized there was no danger. Some of
the servants had gone back through the gateway before Aviendha
disposed of it, but the rest stood with the three dozen or so
packhorses, occasionally glancing at the Aes Sedai, clearly
wondering what marvel they might produce next. The Windfinders were
all mounted, if awkwardly, and holding their reins as though
expecting their horses to bolt any moment, or perhaps sprout wings
and take flight. So were the Knitting Circle, with a good deal more
grace, unconcerned that their skirts and petticoats were pushed up
past their knees, and with Ispan still hooded and tied across a
saddle like a sack. She could not possibly have sat upright on a
horse, yet even Sumeko&rsquo;s eyes popped whenever they touched
her.</p>

<p>Glaring about her, Nynaeve looked ready to
tongue-lash everybody into doing what they had already done, but
only until Lan handed her the reins of her plump brown mare. She
had adamantly refused the gift of a better horse from Tylin. Her
hand trembled a little when it touched Lan&rsquo;s, and her face
changed color as she swallowed the anger she had been about to
unleash. When he offered a hand for her foot, she stared at him for
a moment as if wondering what he was about, then colored again when
he boosted her to her saddle. Elayne could only shake her head. She
hoped she did not turn into an idiot when she married. If she
married.</p>

<p>Birgitte brought her silvery-gray mare and the yellow
dun Aviendha rode, but she seemed to understand that Elayne wanted
a private word with Aviendha. She nodded almost as if Elayne had
spoken, swung up onto her mouse-colored gelding, and rode to where
the other Warders were waiting. They greeted her with nods and
began discussing something in low voices. By the glances directed
at the sisters, the &ldquo;something&rdquo; had to do with taking care of Aes
Sedai whether Aes Sedai wanted care taken or not. Including
herself, Elayne noted grimly. There was no time now for that,
though. Aviendha stood fiddling with her horse&rsquo;s reins,
staring at the animal like a novice staring at a kitchen full of
greasy pots. Very likely, Aviendha saw small difference between
having to scrub pots and having to ride.</p>

<p>Snugging her green riding gloves, Elayne casually
shifted Lioness to block them from the others&rsquo; view, then
touched Aviendha&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Talking to Adeleas or Vandene might
help,&rdquo; she said gently. She had to be very careful here, as careful
as with any <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re old enough to
know more than you might suspect. There has to be a reason
you&rsquo;ve been&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;having trouble&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;with Traveling.&rdquo; That
was a mild way of putting it. Aviendha almost had failed to make
the weave work at all, in the beginning. Careful. Aviendha was far
more important than any <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> ever could be.
&ldquo;They might be able to help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can they?&rdquo; Aviendha stared stiffly at the saddle
on her gelding. &ldquo;They cannot Travel. How could any of them know how
to help?&rdquo; Abruptly her shoulders slumped, and she turned her head
to Elayne. Shockingly, unshed tears glistened in her green eyes.
&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t the truth, Elayne. Not the whole truth. They
cannot help, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;You are my near-sister; you have the right
to know. They think I panicked at a servant. If I ask for help, it
must all come out. That I Traveled once to run from a man, a man I
hoped in my soul would catch me. To run like a rabbit. To run,
wanting to be caught. How could I let them know such shame? Even if
they really could help, how could I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne wished she did not know. About the catching
part, at least. About the fact that Rand <em>had</em> caught her.
Snatching the flecks of jealousy that suddenly were floating
through her, she pushed them into a sack and stuffed it into the
back of her head. Then she jumped up and down on it for good
measure. <em>When a woman plays the fool, look for the man</em>.
That was one of Lini&rsquo;s favorites. Another was, <em>Kittens
tangle your yarn, men tangle your wits, and it&rsquo;s simple as
breathing for both</em>. She drew a deep breath. &ldquo;No one will know
from me, Aviendha. I&rsquo;ll help you as much as I can. If I can
figure out how.&rdquo; Not that there was much she could think to do.
Aviendha was remarkably quick at seeing how weaves were formed,
much quicker than she herself.</p>

<p>Aviendha merely nodded and scrambled clumsily into
her saddle, showing a bit more grace than the Sea Folk. &ldquo;There was
a man watching, Elayne, and he was no servant.&rdquo; Looking Elayne
right in the eye, she added, &ldquo;He frightened me.&rdquo; An admission she
likely would have made to no one else in the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re safe from him now, whoever he was,&rdquo;
Elayne said, turning Lioness to follow Nynaeve and Lan from the
clearing. In truth, it very likely had been a servant, but she
would never tell that to anyone, Aviendha least of all. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
safe, and in a few more hours, we will reach the Kin&rsquo;s farm,
we&rsquo;ll use the Bowl, and the world will be right again.&rdquo; Well,
somewhat. The sun seemed lower than it had in the stableyard, but
she knew that was only imagination. For once, they had gained a
clear jump on the Shadow.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">From behind a screen of white wrought iron, Moridin
watched the last of the horses vanish through the gateway, and then
the tall young woman and the four Warders. It was possible they
were carrying away some item he could use&mdash;an <em>
angreal</em> attuned to men, perhaps&mdash;but the chances were
small. For the rest, the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, the greatest
likelihood was that they would kill themselves trying to puzzle out
how to use them. Sammael was a fool to have risked so much to seize
a collection of no one knew what. But then, Sammael had never been half
as clever as he thought. He himself would not disrupt his own plans
merely on the off chance, to see what scraps of civilization he
could find. Only idle curiosity had brought him here. He liked to
know what others thought important. But it was dross.</p>

<p>He was about to turn away when the outlines of the
gateway suddenly began to flex and tremble. Transfixed, he watched
until the opening simply&mdash;melted. He had never been a man to
give way to obscenities, but several rose in his mind. What had the
woman done? These barbarous rustics offered too many surprises. A
way to Heal being severed, however imperfectly. That was
impossible! Except that they had done it. Involuntary rings. Those
Warders and the bond they shared with their Aes Sedai. He had known
of that for a long, long time, but whenever he thought he had the
measure of them, these <em>primitives</em> revealed some new skill,
did something that no one in his own Age had dreamed of. Something
the pinnacle of civilization had not known! What had the girl
done?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great Master?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moridin barely turned his head from the window. &ldquo;Yes,
Madic?&rdquo; Her soul be damned, what had the girl done?</p>

<p>The balding man in green-and-white who had slipped
into the small room bowed deeply before falling to his knees. One
of the upper servants in the palace, Madic, with his long face,
possessed a pompous dignity that he tried to maintain even now.
Moridin had seen men who stood far higher do far worse. &ldquo;Great
Master, I have learned what the Aes Sedai brought to the palace
this morning. It is said they found a great treasure hidden in
ancient days, gold and jewels and heartstone, artifacts from Shiota
and Eharon and even the Age of Legends. There are said to be things
among them that use the One Power. It is said that one can control
the weather. No one knows where they are going, Great Master. The
palace is aquiver with talk, but ten tongues name ten different
destinations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moridin went back to studying the stableyard below as
soon as Madic spoke. Ridiculous tales of gold and <em>
cuendillar</em> held no interest. Nothing would make a gateway
behave that way. Unless&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Could she actually have <em>
unraveled</em> the web? Death held no fear for him. Coldly he
considered the possibility that he had been within sight of an
unraveling web. One that had been unmade successfully. Another
impossibility casually offered up by these&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Something Madic had said caught his ear. &ldquo;The
weather, Madic?&rdquo; The shadows of the palace spires had barely
lengthened from their bases, but there was not a cloud to shield
the baking city.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Great Master. It is called the Bowl of the
Winds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The name meant nothing to him. But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em> to control the weather&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;In his own Age,
weather had been carefully regulated with the use of <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. One of the surprises of this Age&mdash;one
of the smaller, it had seemed&mdash;was that there were those who
could manipulate weather to a degree that should have required one
of those <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. One such device should not be
enough to affect even a large part of a single continent. But what
could these women do with it? What? If they used a ring?</p>

<p>He seized the True Power without thought, the <em>saa</em>
billowing black across his sight. His fingers tightened in the
wrought-iron grille across the window; the metal groaned, twisting,
not from his grip but from the tendrils of the True Power, drawn
from the Great Lord himself, that wreathed around the grillework,
flexing as he flexed his hand in anger. The Great Lord would not be
pleased. He had strained from his prison to touch the world enough
to fix the seasons in place. He was impatient to touch the world
more, to shatter the void that contained him, and he would not be
pleased. Rage enveloped Moridin, blood pounding in his ears. A
moment past, he had not cared where those women went, but now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Somewhere far from here. People fleeing ran as far and as fast as
they could. Somewhere they felt safe. No use sending Madic to ask
questions, no use squeezing anyone here; they would not have been
fool enough to leave anyone behind alive who knew their
destination. Not to Tar Valon. To al&rsquo;Thor? To that band of
rebel Aes Sedai? In all three places he had eyes, some that did not
know they served him. All would serve him, before the end. He would
not allow chance slips to spoil his plans now.</p>

<p>Abruptly he heard something other than the thundering
drumbeat of his own fury. A bubbling sound. He looked at Madic
curiously, and stepped back from the spreading puddle on the floor.
It seemed that in his anger he had seized at more than the
wrought-iron screen with the True Power. Remarkable how much blood
could be squeezed from a human body.</p>

<p>He let what remained of the man fall without regret;
indeed, thinking only that when Madic was found, the Aes Sedai
would surely be blamed. A small addition to the chaos growing in
the world. Ripping a hole in the fabric of the Pattern, he Traveled
with the True Power. He had to find those women before they used
this Bowl of the Winds. And failing that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He disliked people
meddling with his carefully laid plans. Those who did so and lived,
lived to pay.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The <em>gholam</em> stepped into the room cautiously,
nostrils already twitching with the scent of still hot blood. The
livid burn on its cheek seemed like a live coal. The <em>
gholam</em> appeared to be merely a slender man, a little taller
than average in this time, yet it had never encountered anything
that could harm it. Until that man with the medallion. What might
have been smile or snarl bared its teeth. Curious, it peered around
the room, but there was nothing beyond the crushed corpse on the
floor tiles. And a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;feel&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;of something. Not the One
Power, but something that made it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;itch, if not quite in the
same way. Curiosity had brought it here. Parts of the grill over
the window were crushed, pulling the whole thing loose at the
sides. The <em>gholam</em> seemed to remember something that made
it itch in that manner, yet so much of what it recalled was fogged
and dim. The world had changed, as it seemed, in the blink of an
eye. There had been a world of war and killing on a huge scale,
with weapons that reached across miles, across thousands of miles,
and then there was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;this. But the <em>gholam</em> had not
changed. It was still the most dangerous weapon of all.</p>

<p>Its nostrils flared again, though it was not by scent
that it tracked those who could channel. The One Power had been
used below, and miles to the north. To follow, or not? The man who
had wounded it was not with them; it had made sure of that before
leaving the high vantage place. The one who commanded it wanted the
man who had wounded it dead perhaps as much as he did the women,
but the women were an easier target. The women had been named, too,
and for the time being, it was constrained. For its entire
existence it had been compelled to obey one or another human, but
its mind held the concept of not being constrained. It must follow
the women. It wanted to follow. The moment of death, when it felt
the ability to channel vanish along with life, produced ecstasy.
Rapture. But it was hungry, too, and there was time. Where they
could run, it could follow. Settling fluidly beside the mangled
body, it began to feed. Fresh blood, hot blood, was a necessity,
but human blood always held the sweetest savor.</p>
