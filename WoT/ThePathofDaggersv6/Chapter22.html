<h4><em>Gathering Clouds</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">U</span>nder
a steady drizzle Rand&rsquo;s small army formed
columns across the low folded hills facing the Nemarellin peaks,
dark and sharp against the western sky. There was no real need to
face the direction you intended to Travel, but it always felt askew
to Rand otherwise. Despite the rain, rapidly thinning gray clouds
let through startlingly bright sunshine. Or maybe the day only
seemed bright, after all the recent gloom.</p>

<p>Four of the columns were headed by Bashere&rsquo;s
Saldaeans, bandy-legged unarmored men in short coats standing
patiently beside their mounts beneath a small forest of shining
lance heads, the other five by blue-coated men with the Dragon on
their chests, commanded by a short stocky fellow named Jak Masond.
When Masond moved, it was always with surprising quickness, but he
was utterly still now, feet planted astride and hands folded behind
his back. His men were in place, and so were the Defenders and
Companions, grumpy about being behind infantry. It was the nobles
and their folk, mainly, who milled about as if unsure where to go.
Thick mud sucked at hooves and boots, and mired cart wheels;
shouted curses rose. It took time to line up nearly six thousand
soaked men, getting wetter by the minute. And that was not counting
the supply carts, and the remounts.</p>

<p>Rand had donned his finest, so he would stand out at
a glance. A lick with the Power had polished the Dragon
Scepter&rsquo;s spearhead to mirror brightness, and another had
burnished the Crown of Swords so the gold gleamed. The gilded
Dragon buckle of his sword belt caught the light, and so did the
thread-of-gold embroidery that covered his blue silk coat. For a
moment, he regretted giving away the gems that once had decked his
sword&rsquo;s hilt and scabbard. The dark boarhide was serviceable,
but any armsman could have worn that. Let men know who he was. Let
the Seanchan know who had come to destroy them.</p>

<p>Sitting Tai&rsquo;daishar on a broad flat, he
impatiently watched the nobles roil about on the hills. A little
way off on the flat, Gedwyn and Rochaid sat their saddles in front
of their men, all formed into a precise box, Dedicated in the front
rank, Soldiers lined up behind. They looked ready to parade. As
many had gray hair or nearly none as were young&mdash;several were
as young as Hopwil or Morr&mdash;but every one was strong enough
to make a gateway. That had been a requirement. Flinn and Dashiva
waited behind Rand in a casual cluster with Adley and Morr, Hopwil
and Narishma. And a rigid pair of mounted bannermen, one Tairen and
one Cairhienin, their breastplates and helmets and even their
steel-backed gauntlets buffed and polished till they shone. The
crimson Banner of Light and the long white Dragon Banner hung limp
and dripping. Rand had assumed the Power in his tent, where his
momentary stagger would not be seen, and the sparse rain failed by
an inch to touch him or his horse.</p>

<p>The taint on <em>saidin</em> felt especially heavy
today, a thick foul oil that oozed into his pores and stained his
bones deep. Stained his soul. He had thought himself accustomed to
the vileness, after a fashion, yet today it was nauseating,
stronger than the frozen fire and molten cold of <em>saidin</em>
itself. He held on to the Source as often as possible now,
accepting the vileness to avoid the new sickness of seizing it. It
could be deadly, if he let sickness distract him from <em>that</em>
struggle. Maybe it was connected to the dizzy spells, somehow.
Light, he could not go mad yet, and he could not die. Not yet.
There was too much still to be done.</p>

<p>He pressed his left leg against
Tai&rsquo;daishar&rsquo;s flank just to feel the long bundle strapped
between stirrup leather and scarlet saddle cloth. Every time he did
that, something wriggled across the outside of the Void.
Anticipation, and maybe a touch of fear. Well trained, the gelding
started to turn left, and Rand had to rein him back. When <em>
would</em> the nobles sort themselves out? He ground his teeth in
impatience.</p>

<p>He could remember as a boy hearing men laugh that
when rain fell in sunshine the Dark One was beating Semirhage. Some
of that laughter had been uneasy, though, and scrawny old Cenn Buie
would always snarl that Semirhage would be smarting and angry after
that, and come for small boys who did not keep out of their
elders&rsquo; way. That had been enough to send Rand running, when
he was little. He wished Semirhage <em>would</em> come for him now,
right that instant. He would make her weep.</p>

<p><em>Nothing makes Semirhage weep</em>, Lews Therin
muttered. <em>She gives tears to others, but she has none
herself</em>.</p>

<p>Rand laughed softly. If she came today, he <em>
would</em> make her weep. Her and the rest of the Forsaken
together, if they came today. Most assuredly he would make the
Seanchan weep.</p>

<p>Not everyone was pleased with the orders he had
given. Sunamon&rsquo;s oily smile vanished when he thought Rand did
not see. Torean had a flask in his saddlebags, no doubt brandy, or
maybe several flasks, because he drank steadily and never appeared
to run dry. Semaradrid and Marcolin and Tihera each appeared in
front of Rand to protest the numbers with somber faces. A few years
before, close on six thousand men would have been army enough for
any war, but they had seen armies in the tens of thousands, now,
hundreds of thousands, as in Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s day, and to go
against the Seanchan, they wanted far more. He sent them away
disgruntled. They did not understand that fifty-odd Asha&rsquo;man
were as big a hammer as anyone could wish for. Rand wondered what
they would have said had he told them <em>he</em> was hammer enough
by himself. He had considered doing this by himself. It might come
to that yet.</p>

<p>Weiramon came; he did not like having to take orders
from Bashere, or the fact that they were going into mountains&mdash;very hard to mount a decent charge in mountains&mdash;or
several other things&mdash;Rand was certain there were at least
several more&mdash;that Rand did not let him utter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Saldaean seems to believe I should ride on the
right flank,&rdquo; Weiramon muttered disparagingly. He twisted his
shoulders as though the right flank were a great insult, for some
reason. &ldquo;And the foot, my Lord Dragon. Really, I think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> think you should get your men ready,&rdquo;
Rand said coldly. Part of the chill was the effect of floating in
emotionless emptiness. &ldquo;Or you won&rsquo;t be on <em>any</em>
flank.&rdquo; He meant that he would leave the man behind if he was not
ready in time. Surely such a fool could not make much trouble left
in this remote spot with only a few armsmen. Rand would be back
before he could ride to anything larger than a village.</p>

<p>Blood drained from Weiramon&rsquo;s face, though. &ldquo;As
my Lord Dragon commands,&rdquo; he said, briskly for him, and was
whirling his horse away before the words were well out of his
mouth. His mount was a tall deep-chested bay, today.</p>

<p>The pale Lady Ailil reined to a stop in front of
Rand, accompanied by the High Lady Anaiyella, a strange pair to be
in company, and not just because their nations hated one another.
Ailil was tall for a Cairhienin woman, if only for a Cairhienin,
and everything about her was dignity and precision, from the arch
of her eyebrow to the turn of her red-gloved wrist to the way her
pearl-collared rain cape lay spread across the rump of her
smoke-gray mare. Unlike Semaradrid or Marcolin, Weiramon or Tihera,
she did not so much as blink at the sight of raindrops sliding down
nothing around him. Anaiyella did blink. And gasp. And titter
behind her hand. Anaiyella was willowy and darkly beautiful, her
rain cape collared with rubies and embroidered with gold besides,
but there any resemblance to Ailil ended. Anaiyella was all mincing
elegance and simpers. When she bowed, her white gelding did, too,
bending its forelegs. The prancing animal was showy, but Rand
suspected it had no bottom. Like its mistress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord Dragon,&rdquo; Ailil said, &ldquo;I must make one more
protest against my inclusion in this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;expedition.&rdquo; Her voice
was coolly neutral, if not exactly unfriendly. &ldquo;I will send my
retainers where you command and when, but I have no desire at all
to be in the thick of a battle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; Anaiyella added, with a delicate shudder.
Even her tone simpered! &ldquo;Nasty things, battles. So my Master of the
Horse says. Surely you won&rsquo;t really make us go, my Lord
Dragon? We&rsquo;ve heard you have a particular care for women.
Haven&rsquo;t we, Ailil?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand was so astonished that the Void collapsed, and
<em>saidin</em> vanished. Raindrops began to trickle through his
hair and seep through his coat, but for a moment, clutching his
saddle&rsquo;s high pommel to hold himself upright, seeing four
women instead of two, he was too stunned to notice. How much did
they know? They had <em>heard</em>? How many people knew? How did
anyone know? Light, rumor had him killing Morgase, Elayne,
Colavaere, a hundred women probably, and each in a worse way than
the last! He swallowed against the urge to sick up. That was only
partly <em>saidin&rsquo;s</em> fault. <em>Burn me, how many spies
are there watching me?</em> The thought was a growl.</p>

<p><em>The dead watch</em>, Lews Therin whispered. <em>
The dead never close their eyes</em>. Rand shivered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do try to be careful of women,&rdquo; he told them when
he could speak. Faster than a man, and for half the reason.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I want keep you close the next few days. But if
you really dislike the idea so much, I could tell off one of the
Asha&rsquo;man. You&rsquo;d be safe at the Black Tower.&rdquo; Anaiyella
squeaked prettily, but her face went gray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, no,&rdquo; Ailil said after a moment,
absolutely calm. &ldquo;I suppose I had best confer with my lance-captain
about what to expect.&rdquo; But she paused in turning her mare away, and
regarded Rand with a sidelong look. &ldquo;My brother Toram is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;impetuous, my Lord Dragon. Even rash. I am not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anaiyella smiled much too sweetly at Rand, and
actually wriggled slightly before following, but once she faced
away from him, she dug in her heels and worked her jewel-handled
quirt, quickly passing the other woman. That white gelding showed a
surprising turn of speed.</p>

<p>At last all was ready, the columns formed, snaking
back over the low hills.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Begin,&rdquo; Rand told Gedwyn, who wheeled his horse and
began barking orders to his men. The eight Dedicated rode forward
and dismounted on the ground they had memorized, facing the
mountains. One of them looked familiar, a grizzled fellow whose
pointed Tairen beard appeared odd on his wrinkled countryman&rsquo;s
face. Eight vertical lines of sharp blue light turned and became
openings that showed slightly different views of a long, sparsely
wooded mountain valley rising to a steep pass. In Altara. In the
Venir Mountains.</p>

<p><em>Kill them</em>, Lews Therin wept pleadingly. <em>
They&rsquo;re too dangerous to live!</em> Without thought, Rand
suppressed the voice. Another man channeling often brought that
reaction from Lews Therin, or even a man who could. He no longer
wondered why.</p>

<p>Rand muttered a command, and Flinn blinked in
surprise before hurrying to join the line and weave a ninth
gateway. None was as large as Rand could make, but any would pass a
cart, if closely. He had intended to do that himself, but he did
not want to chance seizing <em>saidin</em> again in front of
everyone. He noticed Gedwyn and Rochaid watching him, wearing
identical knowing smiles. And Dashiva as well, frowning, lips
moving as he talked to himself. Was it his imagination, or was
Narishma eyeing him askance too? And Adley? Morr?</p>

<p>Rand shivered before he could stop himself. Mistrust
of Gedwyn and Rochaid was simple sense, but was he coming down with
what Nynaeve had called the dreads? A kind of madness, a crippling
dark suspicion of everyone and everything? There had been a Coplin,
Benly, who thought everybody was scheming against him. He had
starved to death when Rand was a boy, refusing to eat for fear of
poison.</p>

<p>Ducking low on Tai&rsquo;daishar&rsquo;s neck, Rand
heeled the gelding through the largest gateway. Flinn&rsquo;s, as it
happened, but he would have ridden through one made by Gedwyn right
then. He was the first onto Altaran soil.</p>

<p>The others followed quickly, the Asha&rsquo;man first
of all. Dashiva stared in Rand&rsquo;s direction, frowning, and
Narishma, too, but Gedwyn immediately began directing his Soldiers.
One by one, they rushed forward, opened a gateway and darted
through, dragging their mounts behind them. Ahead up the valley,
bright flashes of light told of gateways opening and closing. The
Asha&rsquo;man could Travel short distances without first memorizing
the ground they left from, and cover ground far faster than riding.
In short order, only Gedwyn and Rochaid remained, aside from the
Dedicated holding the gateways. The others would be fanning out
westward, searching for Seanchan. The Saldaeans were through from
Illian, and mounting. Legionmen spread into the trees at a trot,
crossbows held ready. In this country, they could move as fast
afoot as men on horseback.</p>

<p>As the rest of the army began emerging, Rand rode up
the valley in the direction the Asha&rsquo;man had gone. Mountains
rose high behind him, a wall fronting the Deep, but west the peaks
ran almost to Ebou Dar. He quickened the gelding&rsquo;s pace to a
canter.</p>

<p>Bashere caught him before he reached the pass. The
man&rsquo;s bay was small&mdash;most of the Saldaeans rode small
horses&mdash;but quick. &ldquo;No Seanchan here, it seems,&rdquo; he said
almost idly, stroking his mustaches with a knuckle. &ldquo;But there
could have been. Tenobia&rsquo;s likely to have my head on a pike
soon enough for following a live Dragon Reborn, much more a dead
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand scowled. Maybe he could take Flinn, to watch his
back, and Narishma, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Flinn had saved his life; the man had
to be true. Men could change, though. And Narishma? Even after&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? He felt cold at the risk he had taken. Not the dreads. Narishma
<em>had</em> proved true, but it still had been a mad risk. As mad
as running from stares he was not even sure were real, running to
where he had no notion what was waiting. Bashere was right, but
Rand did not want to talk about it further.</p>

<p>The slopes leading up into the pass were bare stone
and boulders of all sizes, but among the natural stone lay
weathered pieces of what must have once been a huge statue. Some
were just recognizable as worked stone, others more so. A beringed
hand nearly big as his chest, gripping a sword hilt with a broken
stub of blade wider than his hand. A great head, a woman with
cracks across her face and a crown that seemed to be made of
upthrusting daggers, some still whole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who do you think she was?&rdquo; he asked. A queen, of
course. Even if merchants or scholars had worn crowns in some
distant time, only rulers and generals earned statues.</p>

<p>Bashere twisted in his saddle to study the head
before speaking. &ldquo;A Queen of Shiota, I&rsquo;ll wager,&rdquo; he said
finally. &ldquo;Not older. I saw a statue made in Eharon once, and it was
so worn you couldn&rsquo;t say whether it was man or woman. A
conqueror, or they wouldn&rsquo;t have shown her with a sword. And I
seem to recall Shiota gave a crown like that to rulers who expanded
the borders. Maybe they called it the Crown of Swords, eh? A Brown
sister might be able to tell you more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t important,&rdquo; Rand told him irritably.
They did look like swords.</p>

<p>Bashere went on anyway, graying eyebrows lowered,
gravely serious. &ldquo;I expect thousands cheered her, called her the
hope of Shiota, maybe even believed she was. In her time, she might
have been as feared and respected as Artur Hawkwing was later, but
now even the Brown sisters may not know her name. When you die,
people begin to forget, who you were and what you did, or tried to
do. Everybody dies eventually, and everybody is forgotten,
eventually, but there&rsquo;s no bloody point dying before your time
comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t intend to,&rdquo; Rand said sharply. He knew
where he was meant to die, if not when. He thought he did.</p>

<p>The corner of his eye caught motion, back down where
bare stone gave way to brush and a few small trees. Fifty paces
away, a man stepped into the open and raised a bow, smoothly
drawing fletchings to cheek. Everything seemed to happen at
once.</p>

<p>Snarling, Rand hauled Tai&rsquo;daishar around,
watching the archer adjust to follow. He seized <em>saidin</em> and
sweet life and filth poured into him together. His head spun. There
were two archers. Bile rose in his throat as he fought wild,
uncontrolled surges of the Power that tried to sear him to the bone
and freeze his flesh solid. He <em>could</em> not control them; it
was all he could do to stay alive. Desperately, he fought to clear
his sight, to be able to see well enough to weave the flows he
could barely form, with nausea flooding him as strongly as the
Power. He thought he heard Bashere shout. Two archers loosed.</p>

<p>Rand should have died. At that range, a boy could
have hit his target. Maybe being <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> saved him.
As the archer let fly, a covey of gray-winged quail burst up almost
at his feet uttering piercing whistles. Not enough to throw off an
experienced man, and indeed, the fellow only flinched a hair. Rand
felt the wind of the arrow&rsquo;s passage against his cheek.</p>

<p>Fireballs the size of fists suddenly struck the
archer. He screamed as his arm spun away, hand still gripping the
bow. Another took his left leg at the knee, and he fell
shrieking.</p>

<p>Leaning out of his saddle, Rand vomited onto the
ground. His stomach tried to heave up every meal he had ever eaten.
The Void and <em>saidin</em> left with a sickening wrench. It was
nearly more than he could manage not to fall.</p>

<p>When he could sit upright again, he took the white
linen handkerchief Bashere silently offered, and wiped his mouth.
The Saldaean frowned with concern, as well he might. Rand&rsquo;s
stomach wanted to find more to spew out. He thought his face must
be pale. He drew a deep breath. Losing <em>saidin</em> that way
could kill you. But he could still sense the Source; at least <em>
saidin</em> had not burned him out. At least he could see properly;
there was only one Davram Bashere. But the illness seemed a little
worse each time he seized <em>saidin</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if there&rsquo;s enough left of this
fellow to talk,&rdquo; he told Bashere. There was not.</p>

<p>Rochaid was on his knees, calmly searching through
the corpse&rsquo;s torn, bloodstained coat. Besides his missing arm
and leg, the dead man had a blackened hole as big as his head all
the way through his chest. It was Eagan Padros; his sightless eyes
stared at the sky in surprise. Gedwyn ignored the body at his feet,
studying Rand instead, as cold as Rochaid. Both men held <em>
saidin</em>. Surprisingly, Lews Therin only moaned.</p>

<p>In a clatter of hooves on stone, Flinn and Narishma
came galloping up the rise, followed by nearly a hundred Saldaeans.
As they came close, Rand could feel the Power in the grizzled old
man and the younger, maybe as much as they could hold. They had
both leaped up in strength since Dumai&rsquo;s Wells. That was the
way of it with men; women seemed to gain smoothly, but men suddenly
jumped. Flinn was stronger than Gedwyn or Rochaid either one, and
Narishma not far behind. For the time being; there was no way to
know how it would end. None came close to matching Rand, though.
Not yet, anyway. There was no way to tell what time would bring.
Not the dreads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems it&rsquo;s well we decided to follow you, my
Lord Dragon.&rdquo; Gedwyn&rsquo;s voice assumed concern, just shy of
mocking. &ldquo;Are you suffering from a tender stomach this
morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand just shook his head. He could not take his eyes
from Padros&rsquo; face. Why? Because he had conquered Illian?
Because the man had been loyal to &ldquo;Lord Brend&rdquo;?</p>

<p>With a loud exclamation, Rochaid ripped a washleather
pouch from Padros&rsquo; coat pocket and upended it. Bright golden
coins spilled onto the stony ground, bouncing and clinking. &ldquo;Thirty
crowns,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;Tar Valon crowns. No doubt who paid him.&rdquo; He
snatched a coin and tossed it up for Rand, but Rand made no effort
to catch it, and it glanced off his arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty of Tar Valon coin to be found,&rdquo;
Bashere said calmly. &ldquo;Half the men in this valley have a few in
their pockets. I do, myself.&rdquo; Gedwyn and Rochaid swiveled to look
at him. Bashere smiled behind his thick mustaches, or at least
showed teeth, but some of the Saldaeans shifted uneasily in their
saddles and fingered belt pouches.</p>

<p>Up where the pass leveled off for a bit between steep
mountain slopes, a slash of light rotated into a gateway, and a
top-knotted Shienaran in a plain black coat trotted through,
pulling his horse behind him. It appeared the first Seanchan had
been found, and not too far away if the man was back so
quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time to move,&rdquo; Rand told Bashere. The man nodded,
but he did not stir. Instead, he studied the two Asha&rsquo;man
standing near Padros. They ignored him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do we do with him?&rdquo; Gedwyn demanded, gesturing
to the corpse. &ldquo;We ought to send him back to the witches, at
least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave him,&rdquo; Rand replied.</p>

<p><em>Are you ready to kill now?</em> Lews Therin
asked. He did not sound insane at all.</p>

<p><em>Not yet</em>, Rand thought. <em>Soon</em>.</p>

<p>Digging his heels into Tai&rsquo;daishar&rsquo;s
flanks, he galloped back down toward his army. Dashiva and Flinn
followed closely, and Bashere and the hundred Saldaeans. They were
all looking around as if they expected another attempt on his life.
To the east, black clouds were building among the peaks, another
cemaros storm. Soon.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The hilltop camp was well laid out, with a meandering
stream close by for water and good lines of sight to the likeliest
ways into the long mountain meadow. Assid Bakuun did not feel pride
in the camp. During thirty years in the Ever Victorious Army, he
had made hundreds of camps; he would as soon have felt pride in
walking across a room without falling down. Nor did he feel pride
in where he was. Thirty years serving the Empress, might she live
forever, and while there had been the occasional rebellion by some
mad upstart with eyes on the Crystal Throne, the bulk of those
years had been spent preparing for this. For two generations, while
the great ships were built to carry the Return, the Ever Victorious
Army had trained and prepared. Bakuun certainly had been proud when
he learned he was to be one of the Forerunners. Surely he could be
forgiven dreams of retaking the lands stolen from Artur
Hawkwing&rsquo;s rightful heirs, even wild dreams to completing this
new Consolidation before the Corenne came. Not such a wild dream
after all, as it turned out, but not at all the way he had
imagined.</p>

<p>A returning patrol of fifty Taraboner lancers rode up
the hillside, red and green stripes painted across their solid
breastplates, veils of mail hiding their thick mustaches. They rode
well, and even fought well, when they had decent leaders. More than
ten times as many were already among the cook fires, or down at the
picket lines tending their mounts, and three patrols were still
out. Bakuun had never expected to find himself with well over half
his command descendants of thieves. And unashamed of it; they would
look you straight in the eyes. The patrol&rsquo;s commander bowed
low to him as their muddy-legged horses passed, but many of the
others went on talking in their peculiar accents, speaking too fast
for Bakuun to understand without listening hard. They had peculiar
notions of discipline, too.</p>

<p>Shaking his head, Bakuun strode across to the <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em>&rsquo;s large tent. Larger than his, of necessity.
Four of them were sitting on stools outside in their dark blue
dresses with the forked lightning on the skirts, enjoying the sun
during this break in the storms. Those were rare enough, now. The
gray-clad <em>damane</em> sat at their feet, with Nerith braiding
her pale hair. Talking to her, as well, all of them joining in and
laughing softly. The bracelet on the end of the silvery <em>
a&rsquo;dam</em>&rsquo;s leash lay on the ground. Bakuun grunted
sourly. He had a favorite wolfhound, back home, and even talked to
him sometimes, but he never expected Nip to carry on a
conversation!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she well?&rdquo; he asked Nerith, not for the first
time. Or the tenth. &ldquo;Is everything well with her?&rdquo; The <em>
damane</em> dropped her eyes and went silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is quite well, Captain Bakuun.&rdquo; A square-faced
woman, Nerith put the proper degree of respect into her voice and
not a whisker beyond. But she stroked the <em>damane</em>&rsquo;s
head soothingly while she talked. &ldquo;Whatever the indisposition, it
is gone, now. A small thing, in any case. Nothing to worry about.&rdquo;
The <em>damane</em> was trembling.</p>

<p>Bakuun grunted again. Not far from the answer he had
received before. Something had been wrong, though, back in Ebou
Dar, and not just with this <em>damane</em>. The <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em> had all been as tight-lipped as clams&mdash;and
the Blood would not say anything, of course, not to the likes of
him!&mdash;but he had heard too many whispers. They said the <em>
damane</em> were all sick, or insane. Light, he had not seen a
single one used around Ebou Dar once the city was secured, not even
for a victory display of Sky Lights, and who had ever heard the
like of that!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope she&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; he began, and cut off as a
<em>raken</em> appeared, sweeping through the eastern pass. Its
great leathery wings beat powerfully for height, and right above
the hill it suddenly tilted and cut a tight circle, one wingtip
pointed almost straight down. A thin red streamer fell away under
the weight of a lead ball.</p>

<p>Bakuun swallowed a curse. Fliers were always showing
off, but if this pair injured one of his men delivering their
scouting report, he would have their hides no matter who he had to
face to get them. He would not have wanted to fight without fliers
to scout, but they <em>were</em> coddled like some Blood&rsquo;s
favorite pet.</p>

<p>Arrow-straight the streamer plummeted. The lead
weight struck the ground and bounced on the crest, almost beside
the tall thin message pole, which was too long to lower unless
there was a message to send. Besides, when it was left down
somebody was always stepping a horse on the thing and breaking the
joins.</p>

<p>Bakuun strode straight to his tent, but his First
Lieutenant was already waiting with the mud-stained streamer and
the message tube. Tiras was a bony man a head taller than him, with
an unfortunate scrap of beard clinging to the point of his
chin.</p>

<p>The report rolled up in the thin metal tube, on a
slip of paper Bakuun could almost see through, was written simply.
He had never been forced to ride on <em>raken</em> or <em>
to&rsquo;raken</em>&mdash;the Light be thanked, and the Empress,
might she live forever, be praised!&mdash;but he doubted it was
easy to handle a pen in a saddle strapped to the back of a flying
lizard. What it said made him flip open the lid of his small camp
desk and write hurriedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a force not ten miles east of here,&rdquo; he
told Tiras. &ldquo;Five or six times our number.&rdquo; Fliers exaggerated
sometimes, but not often by much. How had that many penetrated
these mountains so far without being spotted before? He had seen
the coast to the east, and he wanted his burial prayers paid for
before he tried a landing there. Burn his eyes, the fliers boasted
they would see a flea move anywhere in the range. &ldquo;No reason to
think they know we&rsquo;re here, but I&rsquo;d not mind a few
reinforcements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tiras laughed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give them a brush of the
<em>damane</em>, and that will be that if they outnumber us by
twenty times.&rdquo; His only real fault was a touch of overconfidence. A
good soldier, though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if they have a few&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Aes Sedai?&rdquo; Bakuun said
quietly, hardly stumbling over the name, as he stuffed the
flier&rsquo;s report back into the tube with his own brief message.
He had not really believed <em>anyone</em> could let those&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;women run free.</p>

<p>Tiras&rsquo; face showed that he remembered the tales
about an Aes Sedai weapon. The red streamer floated behind him as
he ran with the message tube.</p>

<p>Soon enough tube and streamer were attached to the
tip of the message pole, a tiny breeze stirring the long red strip
fifteen paces above the hill crest. The <em>raken</em> soared
toward it along the valley, outstretched wings still as death.
Abruptly one of the fliers swung down from the saddle and hung&mdash;upside down!&mdash;below the <em>raken</em>&rsquo;s trailing
claws. It made Bakuun&rsquo;s stomach hurt to watch. But her hand
closed on the streamer, the pole flexed, then vibrated back upright
as the message tube pulled free of the clip, and she scrambled back
up as the creature climbed in slow circles.</p>

<p>Bakuun thankfully put <em>raken</em> and fliers out
of his mind as he surveyed the valley. Broad and long, nearly flat
except for this hill, and surrounded by steep wooded slopes; only a
goat could enter, except by the passes in his sight. With the <em>
damane</em>, he could cut anybody to pieces before they managed to
try attacking across that muddy meadow. He had passed word along,
though; if the enemy came straight on, they would arrive before any
possible reinforcements by three days at best. How <em>had</em>
they come this far unseen?</p>

<p>He had missed the last battles of the Consolidation
by two hundred years, but some of those rebellions had not been
small. Two years fighting on Marendalar, thirty thousand dead, and
fifty times that shipped back to the mainland as property. Taking
notice of the strange kept a soldier alive. Ordering the camp
struck and all signs of it cleared, he began moving his command to
the forested slopes. Dark clouds were massing in the east, another
of those cursed storms coming.</p>
