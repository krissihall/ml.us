<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t
hardly seemed the setting for the explosion Elayne
feared. Harlon Bridge was a village of moderate size, with three
inns and enough houses that no one had to sleep in a hayloft. When
Elayne and Birgitte went downstairs to the common room that
morning, Mistress Dill, the round innkeeper, smiled warmly and
offered as much of a curtsy as her size allowed. It was not just
that Elayne was Aes Sedai. Mistress Dill was so pleased that her
inn was full, what with the roads snowpacked, that she bobbed at
nearly everyone. At their entrance, Aviendha hastily gulped the
last of her breakfast bread and cheese, brushed a few crumbs from
her green dress, and snatched up her dark cloak to join them.</p>

<p>Outside, the sun was just peeking over the horizon, a
low dome of pale yellow. Only a few clouds marred a beautiful blue
sky, and they were white and fluffy, not the sort to carry snow. It
seemed a wonderful day for traveling.</p>

<p>Except that Adeleas was trampling a path up the snowy
street, and the white-haired sister was dragging one of the Kin,
Garenia Rosoinde, by her arm. Garenia was a slim-hipped Saldaean
who had spent the last twenty years as a merchant although she
looked only a few years older than Nynaeve did. Normally, her
strongly hooked nose gave her a forceful appearance, a woman who
would make hard trading and not back away. Now her dark tilted eyes
were large in her face and her wide mouth hung open, emitting a
wordless wail. A growing knot of Kinswomen followed behind, skirts
held high out of the snow, whispering among themselves, with more
running from every direction to join. Reanne and the rest of the
Knitting Circle were in the front, all grim-faced except for
Kirstian, who seemed even paler than usual. Alise was there, too,
wearing an utterly blank expression.</p>

<p>Adeleas stopped in front of Elayne and shoved Garenia
so hard the woman fell to hands and knees in the snow. Where she
stayed, still wailing. The Kinswomen gathered behind her, more of
their number flocking in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m bringing this to you because Nynaeve is
busy,&rdquo; the Brown sister told Elayne. She meant that Nynaeve was
enjoying a little time alone with Lan somewhere, but for once, not
so much as a hint of a smile crossed her lips. &ldquo;Be quiet, child!&rdquo;
she snapped at Garenia. Who promptly went silent. Adeleas gave a
satisfied nod. &ldquo;This is not Garenia Rosoinde,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I finally
recognized her. Zarya Alkaese, a novice who ran away just before
Vandene and I decided to retire and write our history of the world.
She admitted it, when I confronted her. I&rsquo;m surprised Careane
didn&rsquo;t recognize her before this; they were novices together
for two years. The law is clear, Elayne. A runaway must be put back
in white as soon as possible and kept under strict discipline until
she can be returned to the Tower for proper punishment. She
won&rsquo;t think of running again after that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne nodded slowly, trying to think of what to say.
Whether or not Garenia&mdash;Zarya&mdash;thought of running
again, she would not be allowed the opportunity. She was very
strong in the Power; the Tower would not let her go if it took the
rest of her life to earn the shawl. But Elayne was recalling
something she had heard this woman say the first time she met her.
The meaning had not registered then, but now it did. How would
Zarya face novice white again after living as her own woman for
seventy years? Worse, those whispers among the Kinswomen had begun
to sound like rumbles.</p>

<p>She did not have long to think. Suddenly Kirstian
fell to her knees, clutching at Adeleas&rsquo; skirts with one hand.
&ldquo;I submit myself,&rdquo; she said calmly, her tone a wonder coming from
that bloodless face. &ldquo;I was enrolled in the novice book almost
three hundred years ago, and ran away less than a year later. I
submit myself, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and beg mercy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was white-haired Adeleas&rsquo; turn to go
wide-eyed. Kirstian was claiming to have run away from the White
Tower when she herself was an infant, if not before she was born!
Most of the sisters still did not really believe the ages claimed
by the Kin. Indeed, Kirstian appeared just into her middle
years.</p>

<p>Even so, Adeleas recovered herself quickly. However
old the other woman was, Adeleas had been Aes Sedai about as long
as anyone living. She carried an aura of age, and authority. &ldquo;If
that is so, child,&rdquo; her voice did falter just a bit at that, &ldquo;I
fear we must put you in white, too. You will still be punished, but
surrendering as you have will gain you some mitigation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is why I did it.&rdquo; Kirstian&rsquo;s steady tone
was spoiled somewhat by a hard swallow. She was almost as strong as
Zarya&mdash;none of the Knitting Circle were weak&mdash;and she
would be held very closely. &ldquo;I knew you would find me out sooner or
later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adeleas nodded as though that were clearly obvious,
though how the woman would have been found out, Elayne could not
guess. She very much doubted that Kirstian Chalwin was the name the
woman had been born with. Most of the Kin believed in Aes Sedai
omniscience, though. They had, at least.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; Sarainya Vostovan&rsquo;s husky voice cut
through the murmured babble of the Kin. Neither strong enough to
become Aes Sedai nor nearly old enough to stand very high among the
Kin, she still stepped from the pack defiantly. &ldquo;Why should we give
them up to the White Tower? We have helped women run away, and
rightly so! It is not part of the rules to give them back!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Control yourself!&rdquo; Reanne said sharply. &ldquo;Alise, take
Sarainya in hand, please. It seems she forgets too many of the
rules she claims to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alise looked at Reanne, her face still unreadable.
Alise, who enforced the Kin&rsquo;s rules with a firm hand. &ldquo;It is
not part of our rules to hand runaways back, Reanne,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Reanne jerked as though struck. &ldquo;And how do you
suggest keeping them?&rdquo; she demanded finally. &ldquo;We have always held
runaways apart until we were sure they were no longer hunted, and
if they were found before, we let the sisters take them. That is
the <em>rule</em>, Alise. What other rule do you propose violating?
Do you suggest that we actually set ourselves <em>against</em> Aes
Sedai?&rdquo; Ridicule of such a notion larded her voice, yet Alise stood
looking at her, silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; a voice shouted from the crowd of Kinswomen.
&ldquo;We are many, and they are few!&rdquo; Adeleas stared at the crowd in
disbelief. Elayne embraced <em>saidar</em>, though she knew the
voice was right&mdash;the Kin were too many. She felt Aviendha
embracing the Power, and Birgitte setting herself.</p>

<p>Giving herself a shake as if coming to, Alise did
something far more practical, certainly far more effective.
&ldquo;Sarainya,&rdquo; she said loudly, &ldquo;you will report to me when we stop
tonight, with a switch you cut yourself before we leave this
morning. You, too, Asra; I recognize your voice!&rdquo; And then, just as
loudly, she said to Reanne, &ldquo;I will report myself for your judgment
when we stop tonight. I don&rsquo;t see anyone getting ready!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Kinswomen broke up quickly then, heading off to
gather their things, yet Elayne saw some of them talking quietly as
they went. When they rode over the bridge across the frozen stream
that wound down beside the village, with Nynaeve incredulous over
what she had missed and glaring about for someone to call down,
Sarainya and Asra carried switches&mdash;as did Alise&mdash;and
Zarya and Kirstian wore hastily found white dresses beneath their
dark cloaks. The Windfinders pointed at them and laughed
uproariously. But many of the Kinswomen still talked in clusters,
falling silent whenever a sister or one of the Knitting Circle
looked at them. And there was a darkness to their eyes when they
looked at Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>Eight more days of floundering through the snow when
it was not falling, and grinding her teeth in an inn when it was.
Eight more days of brooding by the Kin, of staring bleakly at the
sisters, days of strutting by the Windfinders around Kin and Aes
Sedai alike. On the morning of the ninth day, Elayne began to wish
everyone had simply gone for everyone else&rsquo;s throat.</p>

<p>She was just wondering whether they could cover the
last ten miles to Caemlyn without a murder, when Kirstian rapped at
her door and darted in without waiting for an answer. The
woman&rsquo;s plain woolen dress was not the shade of white proper
for a novice, and she had regained much of her dignity somehow, as
if knowing her future had smoothed her present, but now she made a
hasty curtsy, almost tripping over her cloak, and her nearly black
eyes were anxious. &ldquo;Nynaeve Sedai, Elayne Sedai, Lord Lan says you
are to come at once,&rdquo; she said breathlessly. &ldquo;He told me to speak
to no one, and you aren&rsquo;t to, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne and Nynaeve exchanged looks with Aviendha and
Birgitte. Nynaeve growled something under her breath about the man
not knowing private from public, but it was clear before she
blushed that she did not believe it. Elayne felt Birgitte focus,
the drawn arrow hunting a target.</p>

<p>Kirstian did not know what Lan wanted, only where she
was to lead them. The small hut outside of Cullen&rsquo;s Crossing
where Adeleas had taken Ispan the night before. Lan stood outside,
his eyes as cold as the air, and would not let Kirstian enter. When
Elayne went inside, she saw why.</p>

<p>Adeleas lay on her side beside an overturned stool, a
cup on the rough wooden floor not far from one outstretched hand.
Her eyes stared, and a pool of congealed blood spread out from the
deep slash across her throat. Ispan lay on a small cot, staring at
the ceiling. Lips drawn back in a rictus bared her teeth, and her
bulging eyes seemed full of horror. As well they might have, since
a wrist-thick wooden stake stood out from between her breasts. The
hammer that had plainly been used to drive it in lay beside the
cot, on the edge of a dark stain that ran back under the cot.</p>

<p>Elayne forced herself to stop thinking about emptying
her stomach on the spot. &ldquo;Light,&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;Light! Who could
do this? <em>How</em> could anyone do this?&rdquo; Aviendha shook her
head wonderingly, and Lan did not even bother with that. He just
watched nine directions at once, as though he expected whoever, or
whatever, had committed this murder to come through one of the two
tiny windows if not through the walls. Birgitte drew her belt
knife, and by her face, she dearly wished she had her bow. That
drawn arrow was stronger than ever in Elayne&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>At first, Nynaeve simply stood in one spot, studying
the hut&rsquo;s interior. There was little to see, aside from the
obvious. A second three-legged stool, a rough table holding a
flickering lamp, a green teapot and a second cup, a rude stone
fireplace with cold ash on the hearthstone. That was all. The hut
was so small it only took Nynaeve a step to reach the table.
Dipping her finger into the teapot, she touched it to the tip of
her tongue, then spat vigorously and emptied the whole teapot into
the table in a wash of tea and tea leaves. Elayne blinked
wonderingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Vandene asked coolly from the door.
Lan moved to bar her way, but she stopped him with a small gesture.
Elayne started to put an arm around her, and received another
raised hand to keep her back. Vandene&rsquo;s eyes remained on her
sister, calm in a face of Aes Sedai serenity. The dead woman on the
cot might as well not have existed. &ldquo;When I saw all of you heading
this way, I thought&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;We knew we didn&rsquo;t have many years
remaining, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Her voice sounded serenity itself, but small
wonder if that was a mask. &ldquo;What have you found, Nynaeve?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sympathy looked odd on Nynaeve&rsquo;s face. Clearing
her throat, she pointed to the tea leaves without touching them. To
white shavings among the matted black leaves. &ldquo;This is crimsonthorn
root,&rdquo; she said, trying to sound matter-of-fact and failing.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sweet, so you might miss it in tea unless you know what
it is, especially if you take a lot of honey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vandene nodded, never taking her eyes from her
sister. &ldquo;Adeleas developed a taste for sweet tea in Ebou Dar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little kills pain,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. &ldquo;This much&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;This much kills, but slowly. Even a few sips would be enough.&rdquo;
Taking a deep breath, she added, &ldquo;They might have remained
conscious for hours. Not able to move, but aware. Either whoever
did this didn&rsquo;t want to risk someone coming too soon with an
antidote&mdash;not that I know one, for a brew this strong&mdash;or else they wanted one or the other to know who was killing them.&rdquo;
Elayne gasped at the brutality, but Vandene simply nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ispan, I think, since they appear to have taken the
most time with her.&rdquo; The white-haired Green almost seemed to be
thinking aloud, working out a puzzle. Cutting a throat took less
time than driving a stake through someone&rsquo;s heart. The calm of
her made Elayne&rsquo;s skin crawl. &ldquo;Adeleas would never have
accepted anything to drink from someone she didn&rsquo;t know, not
out here with Ispan. Those two facts name her killer, in a way. A
Darkfriend, and one of our party. One of us.&rdquo; Elayne felt two
chills, her own, and Birgitte&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of us,&rdquo; Nynaeve agreed sadly. Aviendha began
testing the edge of her belt knife on her thumb, and for once,
Elayne felt no objection.</p>

<p>Vandene asked to be left alone with her sister for a
few moments, and sat on the floor to cradle Adeleas in her arms
before they were out of the door. Jaem, Vandene&rsquo;s gnarled old
Warder, was waiting outside with a shivering Kirstian.</p>

<p>Suddenly a wail burst out inside the hut, the
full-throated cry of a woman mourning the loss of everything.
Nynaeve, of all people, turned to go back, but Lan laid a hand on
her arm, and Jaem planted himself before the door with eyes not
much warmer than Lan&rsquo;s. There was nothing to do but leave
them, Vandene to shriek her pain, and Jaem to guard her in it. And
share it, Elayne realized, feeling that knot of emotions in her
head that was Birgitte. She shivered, and Birgitte put an arm
around her shoulders. Aviendha did the same from the other side,
and motioned for Nynaeve to join them, which she did, after a
moment. The murder Elayne had thought of so lightly had come, one
of their companions was a Darkfriend, and the day suddenly felt
cold enough to shatter bones, but there was a warmth in the
closeness of her friends.</p>

<p>The last ten funereal miles to Caemlyn took two days
in the snow, with even the Windfinders decently subdued. Not that
they pushed Merilille any less hard. Not that Kin stopped talking,
and falling silent whenever a sister or one of the Knitting Circle
came near. Vandene, with her sister&rsquo;s silver-mounted saddle on
her horse, appeared as serene as she had at Adeleas&rsquo;
graveside, but Jaem&rsquo;s eyes carried a silent promise of death
that surely rode in Vandene&rsquo;s heart, too. Elayne could not
have been happier to see the walls and towers of Caemlyn if the
very sight had given her the Rose Crown and brought back
Adeleas.</p>

<p>Even Caemlyn, one of the great cities of the world,
had never seen the likes of their party before, and once inside the
fifty-foot walls of gray stone they attracted notice as they
crossed the New City along wide, slush-filled streets bustling with
people and carts and wagons. Shopkeepers stood in their doorways
and gaped. Wagon drivers reined in their teams to stare. Towering
Aielmen and tall Maidens eyed them from every corner, it seemed.
The people seemed to take no notice of the Aiel, but Elayne did.
She loved Aviendha as she did herself, more, but she could not love
an army of armed Aiel walking Caemlyn&rsquo;s streets.</p>

<p>The Inner City, ringed by towered walls of
silver-streaked white, was a remembered delight, and Elayne finally
began to feel that she was coming home. The streets followed the
curves of the hills, and every rise presented a new vista of
snow-covered parks and monuments laid out to be seen from above as
well as up close, of brightly tiled towers shining with a hundred
colors in the afternoon sun. And then the Royal Palace itself was
before them, a confection of pale spires and golden domes and
intricate stonework traceries. The banner of Andor waved from
nearly every prominence, the White Lion on red. And from the
others, the Dragon Banner or the Banner of Light.</p>

<p>At the tall gilded gates of the Palace, Elayne rode
forward alone in her travel-stained gray riding dress. Tradition
and legend said women who first approached the Palace in splendor
always failed. She had made clear that she had to do it alone, yet
she almost wished Aviendha and Birgitte had succeeded in overruling
her. Half the two dozen guards in front of the gates were Aiel
Maidens, the others men in blue helmets and blue coats with a
red-and-gold Dragon marching across the chest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Elayne Trakand,&rdquo; she announced loudly,
surprised at how calm she sounded. Her voice carried, and across
the great plaza people turned from staring at her companions to
stare at her. The ancient formula rolled from her tongue. &ldquo;In the
name of House Trakand, by right of descent from Ishara, I have come
to claim the Lion Throne of Andor, if the Light wills it so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gates opened wide.</p>

<p>It would not be that easy, of course. Even possession
of the Palace was not enough to hold the throne of Andor by itself.
Passing her companions into the care of an astonished Reene Harfor&mdash;and very pleased to see that the graying First Maid, round
and as regal as any queen, still had the Palace in her capable
hands&mdash;and a coterie of servants in red-and-white livery,
Elayne hurried to the Grand Hall, the throne room of Andor. Alone,
again. This was not part of the ritual, not yet. She should have
been going to change into the red silk with the pearl-worked bodice
and white lions climbing the sleeves, but she felt compelled. This
time, not even Nynaeve tried to object.</p>

<p>White columns twenty paces high marched down the
sides of the Grand Hall. The throne room was empty, still. That
would not last long. Clear afternoon light through the glassed
casements in tall windows along the walls mingled with the colored
light through the great windows set in the ceiling, where the White
Lion of Andor alternated with scenes of Andoran victories and the
faces of the land&rsquo;s earliest queens, beginning with Ishara
herself, as dark as any of the Atha&rsquo;an Miere, as full of
authority as any Aes Sedai. No ruler of Andor could forget herself
with the predecessors who had forged this nation staring down at
her.</p>

<p>One thing she feared to see&mdash;the huge
monstrosity of a throne, all gilded Dragons, that she had seen
standing on the dais at the far end of the Hall in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. It was not there, thank the Light.
The Lion Throne no longer rested on a tall plinth like some trophy,
either, but kept its proper place upon the dais, a massive chair,
carved and gilded, but sized for a woman. The White Lion, picked
out in moonstones on a field of rubies, would stand above the head
of any woman who sat there. No man could feel at his ease sitting
on that throne, because, so legend said, he would know he had
sealed his doom. Elayne thought it more likely the builders had
simply made sure a man would not <em>fit</em> on it easily.</p>

<p>Climbing the white marble steps of the dais, she laid
a hand on one arm of the throne. She had no right to sit on it
herself, not yet. Not until she was acknowledged Queen. But taking
oaths on the Lion Throne was a custom as old as Andor. She had to
resist the desire to simply fall on her knees and weep into the
throne&rsquo;s seat. Reconciled to her mother&rsquo;s death she might
be, but this brought back all the pain. She could not break down
now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Under the Light, I will honor your memory, Mother,&rdquo;
she said softly. &ldquo;I will honor the name of Morgase Trakand, and try
to bring only honor to House Trakand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ordered the guards to keep the curious and the
favor-seekers away. I suspected you might want to be alone here for
a time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne turned slowly to face Dyelin Taravin, as the
golden-haired woman walked the length of the Grand Hall. Dyelin had
been one of her mother&rsquo;s earliest supporters in her own quest
for the throne. There was more gray in her hair than Elayne
remembered, more lines at the corners of her eyes. She was still
quite beautiful. A strong woman. And powerful as friend or foe.</p>

<p>She stopped at the foot of the dais, looking up.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been hearing for two days that you were alive, but I
didn&rsquo;t really believe it until now. You&rsquo;ve come to accept
the throne from the Dragon Reborn, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I claim the throne by my own right, Dyelin, with my
own hand. The Lion Throne is no bauble to be accepted from a man.&rdquo;
Dyelin nodded, as at self-evident truth. Which it was, to any
Andoran. &ldquo;How do you stand, Dyelin? With Trakand, or against? I
have heard your name often on my way here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since you claim the throne by your own right, with.&rdquo;
Few people could sound as dry as she. Elayne sat down on the top
step, and motioned the older woman to join her. &ldquo;There are a few
obstacles, of course,&rdquo; Dyelin went on as she gathered her blue
skirts to sit. &ldquo;There have been several claimants already, as you
may know. Naean and Elenia, I have securely locked up. On a charge
of treason that most people seem willing to accept. For the time
being. Elenia&rsquo;s husband is still active for her, though
quietly, and Arymilla has announced a claim, the silly goose.
She&rsquo;s getting support of a kind, but nothing that need worry
you. Your real worries&mdash;aside from Aiel all over the city
waiting for the Dragon Reborn to come back&mdash;are Aemlyn,
Arathelle, and Pelivar. For the moment, Luan and Ellorien will be
behind you, but they might go over to those three.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A very succinct list, delivered in a tone suitable
for discussing a possible horse trade. Naean and Elenia she knew
about, if not that Jarid still thought his wife had a chance at the
throne. Arymilla <em>was</em> a goose to believe she would be
accepted, whatever her support. The last five names were worrying,
though. Each had been as strong a supporter of her mother, as had
Dyelin, and each led a strong House.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So Arathelle and Aemlyn want the throne,&rdquo; Elayne
murmured. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it of Ellorien, not for herself.&rdquo;
Pelivar might be acting for one of his daughters, but Luan had only
granddaughters, none near old enough. &ldquo;You spoke as if they might
unite, all five Houses. Behind whom?&rdquo; That would be a dire
threat.</p>

<p>Smiling, Dyelin propped her chin in her hand. &ldquo;They
seem to think <em>I</em> should have the throne. Now, what do you
intend about the Dragon Reborn? He hasn&rsquo;t been back here in
some time, but he can pop out of the air, it seems.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne squeezed her eyes shut for a moment, but when
she opened them, she was still sitting on the steps of the dais in
the Grand Hall, and Dyelin was still smiling at her. Her brother
fought for Elaida, and her half-brother was a Whitecloak. She had
filled the Palace with women who might turn on one another at any
moment, not to mention the fact that one was a Darkfriend, maybe
even Black Ajah. And the strongest threat she faced in claiming the
throne, a <em>very</em> strong one, stood behind a woman who said
<em>she</em> supported Elayne. The world was quite mad. She might
as well add her bit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean to bond him my Warder,&rdquo; she said, and went on
before the other woman could more than blink in astonishment. &ldquo;I
also hope to marry him. Those things have nothing to do with the
Lion Throne, however. The very first thing I intend&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she went on, Dyelin began to laugh. Elayne wished
she knew whether it was from delight over her plans or because
Dyelin saw her own path to the Lion Throne being made smooth. At
least she knew what she faced, now.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Riding into Caemlyn, Daved Hanlon could not help
thinking what a city for the looting it was. In his years
soldiering, he had seen many villages and towns looted, and once,
twenty years ago, a great city, Cairhien, after the Aiel left.
Strange that all these Aiel had left Caemlyn so apparently
untouched, but then, if the tallest towers in Cairhien had not been
burning, it might have been hard to know they had been there;
plenty of gold, among other things, lying about for the picking up,
and plenty of men to do the picking. He could see these broad
streets full of horsemen and fleeing people, fat merchants who
would give up their gold before the knife touched them in the hope
their lives would be spared, slim girls and plump women so
terrified when they were dragged into a corner that they could
hardly manage to squeal, much less struggle. He had seen those
things and done them, and he hoped to again. Not in Caemlyn,
though, he admitted with a sigh. If the orders that sent him here
had been the sort he could disobey, he would have gone where the
pickings might not be so rich, but definitely easier to pluck.</p>

<p>His instructions had been clear. Stabling his horse
at The Red Bull, in the New City, he walked a mile to a tall stone
house on a side street, the house of a wealthy merchant discreet
about her gold, marked with a tiny painted sigil on the doors, a
red heart on a golden hand. The hulking fellow who let him in was
no merchant&rsquo;s servant, with his sunken knuckles and sullen
eyes. Without a word, the huge man led him deeper into the house,
then down, toward the basements. Hanlon eased his sword in its
scabbard. Among the things he had seen were men and women,
failures, led to their own very elaborate executions. He did not
think he had failed, but then again, he had hardly succeeded. He
had followed orders, though. Which was not always enough.</p>

<p>In the rough stone basement, lit by gilded lamps set
all around, his eyes went first to a pretty woman in a lace-trimmed
dress of scarlet silk, with her hair caught in frothy lace net. He
did not know who this Lady Shiaine was, but his orders had been to
obey her. He made his best leg, smiling. She simply looked at him,
as if waiting for him to notice what else the basement held.</p>

<p>He could hardly have missed it, since except for a
few casks the room held only a large heavy table, decorated in a
very strange fashion. Two ovals had been cut in the tabletop, and
from one stuck the head and shoulders of a man, his head wrenched
back against the wooden surface and held there by means of leather
straps nailed to the tabletop and fastened to a block of wood
jammed between his teeth. A woman, prepared the same, provided the
other decoration. Beneath the table, they knelt with wrists tied to
ankles. Quite securely held for any sort of pleasure. The man had a
touch of gray in his hair and the face of a lord, but
unsurprisingly, his deep-set eyes rolled wildly. The woman&rsquo;s
hair, spread out on the table, was dark and glossy, but her face
was a little long for Hanlon&rsquo;s taste.</p>

<p>Suddenly he really saw her face, and his hand leaped
to his sword before he could stop it. Releasing the hilt took some
effort, which he made pains to hide. An Aes Sedai&rsquo;s face, but
an Aes Sedai who let herself be fastened like that was no
threat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you have some brains,&rdquo; Shiaine said. By her
accents, she was a noble, and she certainly had the commanding air,
sweeping around the table to peer down into the bound man&rsquo;s
face. &ldquo;I asked the Great Master Moridin to send me a man with
brains. Poor Jaichim here has very few.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hanlon frowned, and smoothed it away immediately. His
orders had come from Moghedien herself. Who in the Pit of Doom was
Moridin? It did not matter. His orders had come from Moghedien;
that was enough.</p>

<p>The hulking fellow handed Shiaine a funnel, which she
fitted into a hole bored through the block of wood between this
Jaichim&rsquo;s teeth. The man&rsquo;s eyes seemed ready to leap from
his head. &ldquo;Poor Jaichim here failed very badly,&rdquo; Shiaine said,
smiling like a fox looking at a chicken. &ldquo;Moridin wishes him
punished. Poor Jaichim does like his brandy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stepped back, not so far that she could not see
clearly, and Hanlon gave a start as the hulking man came to the
table with one of the casks. Hanlon did think he could have lifted
the thing unaided, but the big man tipped it easily. The bound man
shrieked once, and then a stream of dark liquid was pouring from
the cask into the funnel, turning his cry to gurgling. The rough
smell of crude brandy filled the air. Secured as he was, the man
fought, thrashing about, even managing to heave the table sideways,
but the brandy kept pouring. Bubbles rose in the funnel as he tried
to shout or scream, but the steady stream never faltered. And then
his thrashing slowed and stopped. Wide, glazing eyes stared up the
ceiling, and brandy trickled from his nostrils. The big fellow
still did not stop until the last drops fell from an empty
cask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think poor Jaichim has finally had enough brandy,&rdquo;
Shiaine said, and laughed in delight.</p>

<p>Hanlon nodded. He supposed the man had, at that. He
wondered who he had been.</p>

<p>Shiaine was not quite finished. At a gesture from
her, the hulking man ripped one of the straps holding the Aes
Sedai&rsquo;s gag off of its nail. Hanlon thought the wooden block
might have loosened a few of her teeth coming out of her mouth, but
if so, she did not waste time on them. She began babbling before
the fellow let go of the strap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will obey you!&rdquo; she howled. &ldquo;I will obey, as the
Great Master commanded! He set the shield on me to dissolve so I
could obey! He told me so! Let me prove myself! I will crawl! I am
a worm, and you are the sun! Oh, please! Please! Please!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shiaine stifled words if not whimpers by putting a
hand over the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s mouth. &ldquo;How do I know you won&rsquo;t
fail again, Falion? You have failed before, and Moridin left your
punishment to me. He gave me another; do I need two of you? I may
give you a second chance to plead your case, Falion&mdash;perhaps&mdash;but if I do, you will have to convince me. I will expect
<em>true</em> enthusiasm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Falion began screaming pleas again, making
extravagant promises, the moment Shiaine&rsquo;s hand moved, but
soon enough she was reduced to wordless shrieks and tears as the
gag was replaced, the nail driven through the strap again, and
Jaichim&rsquo;s funnel placed above her gaping throat. The hulking
man stood another cask on the table beside her head. The Aes Sedai
seemed to go mad, bulging eyes rolling, flinging herself about
below the table till it trembled.</p>

<p>Hanlon was impressed. An Aes Sedai must be harder to
break than a plump merchant or his round-cheeked daughter. Still,
she had had the help of one of the Chosen, it seemed. Realizing
that Shiaine was looking at him, he stopped smiling down at Falion.
His first rule in life was never to offend those the Chosen set
above him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me, Hanlon,&rdquo; Shiaine said, &ldquo;how would you like
to put your hands on a queen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He licked his lips in spite of himself. A queen? <em>
That</em> he had never done.</p>
