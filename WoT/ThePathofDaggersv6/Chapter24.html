<h4><em>A Time for Iron</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">A</span>
 dozen leagues east of Ebou Dar, <em>raken</em>
glided in out of the cloud-streaked sunrise to land in a long
pasture marked as the fliers&rsquo; field by colored streamers on
tall poles. The brown grasses had been trampled and scored days
since. All of the creatures&rsquo; grace in the air was lost as soon
as their claws touched the ground in a lumbering run, leathery
pinions thirty paces or more wide held high as if the animal wanted
to sweep itself back upward. There was little beauty, either, in
the <em>raken</em> that ran awkwardly down the field beating ribbed
wings, fliers crouching in the saddle as if to pull the beast up by
main force, ran on until at last they stumbled into the air,
wingtips barely clearing the tops of the olive trees at the end of
the field. Only as they gained height and turned toward the sun,
soared toward the clouds, did the <em>raken</em> regain dignified
grandeur. Fliers who landed did not bother to dismount. While a
groundling held a basket up for the <em>raken</em> to gulp whole
shriveled fruits by the double-handful at a time, one of the fliers
would hand down their scouting report to a still more senior
groundling, and the other bent on the other side to receive new
orders from a flier too senior to handle reins personally very
often. Almost that quickly after coming to a halt, the creature was
reined around to waddle over to where four or five others waited
their turn to make that long, ungainly run to the sky.</p>

<p>At a dead run, dodging between moving formations of
cavalry and infantry, messengers carried the scouting reports to
the huge red-bannered command tent. There were haughty Taraboner
lancers and stolid Amadician pikemen in well-ordered squares,
breastplates striped horizontally in the colors of the regiments
they were attached to. Altaran light horse in disordered bunches
made their mounts prance, vain of the red slashes crisscrossing
their chests, so different from the markings anyone else wore. The
Altarans did not know those indicated irregulars of doubtful
reliability. Among the Seanchan soldiers, named regiments with
proud honors were represented, from every corner of the Empire,
pale-eyed men from Alqam, honey-brown men from N&rsquo;Kon, men
black as coal from Khoweal and Dalenshar. There were <em>
morat&rsquo;torm</em> on their sinuous bronze-scaled mounts that
made horses whicker and dance in fright, and even a few <em>
morat&rsquo;grolm</em> with their squat, beak-mouthed charges, but
one thing that always accompanied a Seanchan army was conspicuous
by it absence. The <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> and <em>damane</em> were
still in their tents. Captain-General Kennar Miraj thought of <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em> and <em>damane</em> a great deal.</p>

<p>From his seat on the dais he could see the map table
clearly, where helmetless under-lieutenants checked the reports and
placed markers to represent the forces in the field. A small paper
banner stood above each marker, inked symbols giving the size and
composition of the force. Finding decent maps in these lands was
next to impossible, but the map copied atop the large table was
sufficient. And worrying, in what it told him. Black discs for
outposts overrun or dispersed. Far too many of those, dotting the
whole eastern half of the Venir range. Red wedges, for commands on
the move, marked the western end as thickly, all pointed back
toward Ebou Dar. And scattered among the black discs, seventeen
stark white. As he watched, a young officer in the brown-and-black
of a <em>morat&rsquo;torm</em> carefully placed an eighteenth. Enemy
forces. A few might be the same group seen twice, but for the most
part they were much too far apart, the timing of the sightings
wrong.</p>

<p>Along the walls of the tent, clerks in plain brown
coats, marked only with insignia of rank among clerks on the wide
collars, waited at their writing tables, pens in hand, for Miraj to
issue orders that they would copy out for distribution. He had
already given what orders he could. There were as many as ninety
thousand enemy soldiers in the mountains, nearly twice what he
could muster here even with the native levies. Too many for belief,
except that scouts did not lie; liars had their throats slit by
their fellows. Too many, springing out of the ground like
trap-worms in the Sen T&rsquo;jore. At least they had a hundred
miles of mountain yet to cover if they intended to threaten Ebou
Dar. Almost two hundred, for the white discs furthest east. And
hill country after that for another hundred miles. Surely the enemy
general could not mean to let his dispersed forces be confronted
one by one. Gathering them together would take more time. Time
alone was on his side, right then.</p>

<p>The entry flaps of the tent swept open, and the High
Lady Suroth glided in, black hair a proud crest spilling down her
back, pleated snow-white gown and richly embroidered over-robe
somehow untouched by the mud outside. He had thought her still in
Ebou Dar; she must have flown out by <em>to&rsquo;raken</em>. She
was accompanied by a small entourage, for her. A pair of Deathwatch
Guards with black tassels on their sword hilts held the tentflaps,
and more were visible outside, stone-faced men in red-and-green.
The embodiment of the Empress, might she live forever. Even the
Blood took note of them. Suroth sailed past as if they were as much
servants as the lushly bodied <em>da&rsquo;covale</em> in slippers
and a nearly transparent white robe, her honey-yellow hair in a
multitude of thin braids, who carried the High Lady&rsquo;s gilded
writing desk a meek two paces behind. Suroth&rsquo;s Voice of the
Blood, Alwhin, a glowering woman in green robes with the left side
of her head shaved and the remainder of her pale brown hair in a
severe braid, followed close on her mistress&rsquo;s heels. As Miraj
stepped down from the dais, he realized with shock that the second
<em>da&rsquo;covale</em> behind Suroth, short and dark-haired and
slim in her diaphanous robe, was <em>damane</em>! A <em>damane</em>
garbed as property was unheard of, but odder still, it was Alwhin
who led her by the <em>a&rsquo;dam!</em></p>

<p>He let none of his amazement show as he went to one
knee, murmuring, &ldquo;The Light be upon the High Lady Suroth. All honor
to the High Lady Suroth.&rdquo; Everyone else prostrated themselves on
the canvas groundcloth, eyes down. Miraj was of the Blood, if too
low to shave the sides of his scalp like Suroth. Only the nails of
his little fingers were lacquered. Much too low to register
surprise if a High Lady allowed her Voice to continue acting as
<em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> after being raised to the <em>
so&rsquo;jhin</em>. Strange times in a strange land, where the
Dragon Reborn walked and <em>marath&rsquo;damane</em> ran wild to
kill and enslave where they would.</p>

<p>Suroth barely glanced at him before turning to study
the map table, and if her black eyes tightened at what she saw, she
had cause. Under her, the Hailene had done far more than had been
dreamed, reclaiming great stretches of the stolen lands. All they
had been sent for was to scout the way, and after Falme, some had
thought even that impossible. She drummed fingers on the table
irritably, the long blue-lacquered fingernails on the first two
clicking. Continued success, and she might be able to shave her
head entirely and paint a third nail on each hand. Adoption into
the Imperial family was not unheard of for achievements so great.
And if she stepped too far, overstepped, she might find her
fingernails clipped and herself stuffed into a filmy robe to serve
one of the Blood, if not sold to a farmer to help till his fields,
or sweat in a warehouse. At worst, Miraj would only have to open
his own veins.</p>

<p>He continued to watch Suroth in patient silence, but
he had been a scout lieutenant, <em>morat&rsquo;raken</em>, before
being raised to the Blood, and he could not help being aware of
everything around him. A scout lived or died by what he saw or did
not, and so did others. The men lying on their faces around the
tent; some hardly seemed to breathe. Suroth should have taken him
aside and let them continue with their work. A messenger was being
turned back by the soldiers at the entrance. How dire was the
message that the woman tried to push past Deathwatch Guards?</p>

<p>The <em>da&rsquo;covale</em> with the writing desk in
her arms caught his eye. Scowls flashed across her pretty
doll&rsquo;s face, never pushed down for more than moments. Property
showing anger? And there was something else. His gaze flickered to
the <em>damane</em>, who stood with her head down but still looked
around with curiosity. Brown-eyed <em>da&rsquo;covale</em> and
pale-eyed <em>damane</em> looked about as different as two women
could, yet there was something about them. Something in their
faces. Strange. He could not have said how old either was.</p>

<p>Quick as his glance was, Alwhin noticed. With a
twitch of the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>&rsquo;s silvery leash she put the
<em>damane</em> facedown on the groundcloth. Snapping her fingers,
she pointed to the canvas with the hand not encumbered by the <em>
a&rsquo;dam</em>&rsquo;s bracelet, then grimaced when the
honey-haired <em>da&rsquo;covale</em> did not move. &ldquo;Down,
Liandrin!&rdquo; she hissed almost under her breath. With a glare for
Alwhin&mdash;a glare!&mdash;the <em>da&rsquo;covale</em> sank to
her knees, features painted with sulkiness.</p>

<p>Most strange. But hardly important. Face impassive,
and otherwise bursting with impatience, he waited. Impatience and
no little discomfort. He had been raised to the Blood after riding
fifty miles in a single night with three arrows in him to bring
word of a rebel army marching on Seandar itself, and his back still
pained him.</p>

<p>Finally, Suroth turned from the map table. She did
not give him leave to rise, much less embrace him as one of the
Blood. Not that he had expected that. He was far beneath her. &ldquo;You
are ready to march?&rdquo; she demanded curtly. At least she did not
speak to him through her Voice. Before so many of his officers, the
shame would have put his eyes on the ground for months if not
years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will be, Suroth,&rdquo; he replied calmly, meeting her
gaze. He <em>was</em> of the Blood, however low. &ldquo;They cannot
combine in fewer than ten days, with at least another ten before
they can exit the mountains. Well before then, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They could be here tomorrow,&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;Today!
If they come, Miraj, they will come by the ancient art of
Traveling, and it seems very possible that they will come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He heard men shifting on their bellies before they
could restrain themselves. Suroth lost control of her emotions <em>
and</em> babbled of legends? &ldquo;Are you certain?&rdquo; The words popped
out of his mouth before he could stop them.</p>

<p>He had only thought she had lost control before. Her
eyes blazed. She gripped the edges of her flower-worked robe,
white-knuckled, and her hands shook. &ldquo;Do you question me?&rdquo; she
snarled incredulously. &ldquo;Suffice it that I have my sources of
information.&rdquo; And was furious with them as much as with him, he
realized. &ldquo;If they come, there will be perhaps as many as fifty of
these grandly named Asha&rsquo;man, but no more than five or six
thousand soldiers. It seems there have been no more since the
beginning, whatever the fliers say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miraj nodded slowly. Five thousand men, moved about
in some way with the One Power, would explain a great deal. What
were her sources, that she knew numbers so precisely? He was not
fool enough to ask. She certainly had Listeners and Seekers in her
service. Watching her, too. Fifty Asha&rsquo;man. The very idea of a
man channeling made him want to spit in disgust. Rumor claimed they
were being gathered from every nation by the Dragon Reborn, this
Rand al&rsquo;Thor, but he had never expected there could be so
many. The Dragon Reborn could channel, it was said. That might be
true, but he was the Dragon Reborn.</p>

<p>The Prophecies of the Dragon had been known in
Seanchan even before Luthair Paendrag began the Consolidation. In
corrupted form, it was said, much different from the pure version
Luthair Paendrag brought. Miraj had seen several volumes of <em>The
Karaethon Cycle</em> printed in these lands, and they were
corrupted too&mdash;not one mentioned him serving the Crystal
Throne!&mdash;but the Prophecies held men&rsquo;s minds and hearts
still. More than a few hoped the Return came soon, that these lands
could be reclaimed before Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don so the Dragon Reborn
could win the Last Battle for the glory of the Empress, might she
live forever. The Empress surely would want al&rsquo;Thor sent to
her, so she could see what sort of man served her. There would be
no difficulty with al&rsquo;Thor once he had knelt to her. Few
easily shook off the awe they felt, kneeling before the Crystal
Throne, with the thirst to obey drying their tongues. But it seemed
obvious that bundling the fellow onto a ship would be easier if
disposing of the Asha&rsquo;man&mdash;they had to be disposed of,
certainly&mdash;waited until al&rsquo;Thor was well on his way
across the Aryth Ocean to Seandar.</p>

<p>Which brought him back to the problem he had been
trying to avoid, he realized with an inward start. He was not a man
to shy from difficulties, much less ignore them blindly, but this
was different from any he had faced before. He had fought in two
dozen battles with <em>damane</em> used on both sides; he knew the
way of them. It was not only a matter of striking out with the
Power. Experienced <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> could somehow see what
<em>damane</em> or <em>marath&rsquo;damane</em> did and <em>
damane</em> would tell the others, so they could defend as well.
Could <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> see what a man did, too? Worse&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will release the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> and <em>
damane</em> to me?&rdquo; he said. Taking a deep breath in spite of
himself, he added, &ldquo;If they&rsquo;re still sick, it will be a short
fight and bloody. On our side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which produced another stir among the men waiting on
their faces. Every second rumor in the camp was about what illness
had confined the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> and <em>damane</em> to their
tents. Alwhin reacted quite openly, most improper in a <em>
so&rsquo;jhin</em>, with a furious glare. The <em>damane</em>
flinched again, and began to shiver where she lay. Oddly, the
honey-haired <em>da&rsquo;covale</em> flinched, as well.</p>

<p>Smiling, Suroth glided to where the <em>
da&rsquo;covale</em> knelt. Why would she smile at a poorly trained
serving girl? She began stroking the kneeling woman&rsquo;s thin
braids, and a sullen pout appeared on that rosebud mouth. A former
noblewoman of these lands? Suroth&rsquo;s first words supported
that, though obviously meant for him. &ldquo;Small failures bring small
costs; great failures bring painfully great costs. You will have
the <em>damane</em> you require, Miraj. And you will teach these
Asha&rsquo;man they should have remained in the north. You will wipe
them from the face of the earth, the Asha&rsquo;man, the soldiers,
all of them. To the man. Miraj. I have spoken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be as you say, Suroth,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;They
will be destroyed. To the man.&rdquo; There was nothing else he could
say, now. He wished, though, that she had given him an answer about
whether the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> and <em>damane</em> were still
sick.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Rand reined Tai&rsquo;daishar around near the crest of
the bare, stony hill to watch most of his small army spilling out
of other holes in the air. He held hard to the True Source, so hard
it seemed to tremble in his grasp. With the Power in him, the sharp
points of the Crown of Swords pricking his temples felt at once
keener than ever and utterly removed, the midmorning chill both
colder and beneath notice. The never-healing wounds in his side
were a dull and distant ache. Lews Therin seemed to be panting in
uncertainty. Or perhaps fear. Maybe after coming so close to death
the day before, he did not want so much to die anymore. But then,
he did not always want to die. The only constant in the man was the
desire to kill. Which just happened to include killing himself,
often enough.</p>

<p><em>There&rsquo;ll be killing enough for anybody,
soon</em>, Rand thought. <em>Light, the last six days were enough
to sicken a vulture</em>. Had it only been six days? The disgust
did not touch him, though. He would not let it. Lews Therin did not
answer. Yes. It was a time for iron hearts. And iron stomachs, too.
He bent a moment to touch the long cloth-wrapped package under his
stirrup leather. No. Not time, yet. Maybe not at all. Uncertainty
shimmered across the Void, and maybe something else. Not at all, he
hoped. Uncertainty, yes, but the other had not been fear. It had
not!</p>

<p>Half the surrounding low hills were covered with
squat, gnarled olive trees, dappled by the sunlight, where lancers
already rode along the rows to make sure they were clear. There was
no sign of workers in those orchards, no farmhouse, no structure of
any kind in sight. A few miles to the west, the hills were darker,
forested. Legionmen, emerging in trotting files below Rand, formed
up, trailed by a ragged square of Illianer volunteers, now enlisted
into the Legion. As soon as their ranks were aligned, they marched
out of the way to make room for Defenders and Companions. The
ground seemed mostly clay, and boots and hooves alike skidded in
the thin skim of mud. For a wonder, though, only a few clouds hung
in the sky, white and clean. The sun was a pale yellow ball. And
nothing flew up there larger than a sparrow.</p>

<p>Dashiva and Flinn were among the men holding
gateways, as were Adley and Hopwil, Morr and Narishma. Some of the
gateways lay out of Rand&rsquo;s sight behind the folded hills. He
wanted everyone through as quickly as possible, and except for a
few Soldiers scanning the sky, every man in a black coat who was
not already out scouting held a weave. Even Gedwyn and Rochaid,
though both grimaced over it, at each other and in his direction.
Rand thought them no longer used to doing anything so common as
holding a gateway for others to use.</p>

<p>Bashere cantered up the slope, very much at ease with
himself, and with his short bay. His cloak was flung back despite
the morning&rsquo;s coolness, not so cold as the mountains, but
still wintery. He nodded casually to Anaiyella and Ailil, who gave
bleak stares in return. Bashere smiled through those thick
mustaches, like down-curving horns, a not entirely pleasant smile.
He had as many doubts of the women as Rand did. The women knew,
about Bashere&rsquo;s reservations at least. Turning her head
quickly from the Saldaean, Anaiyella returned to stroking her
gelding&rsquo;s mane; Ailil held her reins too rigidly.</p>

<p>That pair had not strayed far from Rand since the
incident on the ridge, even having their tents pitched in earshot
of his the night before. On a brown-grass hillside opposite,
Denharad shifted to study the two noblewomen&rsquo;s retainers,
arrayed together behind him, then quickly returned to watching
Rand. Very likely he watched Ailil, and maybe Anaiyella as well,
but he watched Rand without doubt. Rand was unsure whether they
still feared to take the blame if he was killed or simply wanted to
see it happen. The one thing he was certain of was that if they did
want him dead, he would give them no opportunity.</p>

<p><em>Who knows a woman&rsquo;s heart?</em> Lews Therin
chuckled wryly. He sounded in one of his saner moods. <em>Most
women will shrug off what a man would kill you for, and kill you
for what a man would shrug off</em>. Rand ignored him. The last
gateway in Rand&rsquo;s sight winked out. The Asha&rsquo;man mounting
their horses were too far for him to say for sure whether any still
held on to <em>saidin</em>, but it did not matter so long as he
did. Clumsy Dashiva tried to mount quickly and nearly fell off
twice before successfully reaching his saddle. Most of the
black-coated men in view began riding north or south.</p>

<p>The rest of the nobles gathered quickly with Bashere
on the slope just below Rand, the highest ranking and those with
the most power in front after a little jostling here and there,
where precedence remained uncertain. Tihera and Marcolin kept their
horses on the fringes, on opposite sides of the mass of nobles,
faces carefully blank; they might be asked for advice, but both
knew the final decisions rested with others. Weiramon opened his
mouth with a grand gesture, doubtless to begin another splendid
peroration on the glories of following the Dragon Reborn. Sunamon
and Torean, accustomed to his speeches and powerful enough to take
no care around him, reined their horses together and began talking
quietly. Sunamon&rsquo;s face wore an unaccustomed hardness, and
Torean seemed ready to squabble over a boundary line despite the
red satin stripes on his coatsleeves. Square-jawed Bertome and some
of the other Cairhienin were not quiet at all, laughing at each
other&rsquo;s jokes. Everyone had had a bellyful of Weiramon&rsquo;s
grand declamations. Though Semaradrid&rsquo;s scowl deepened every
time he looked at Ailil and Anaiyella&mdash;he did not like them
remaining close to Rand, especially his countrywoman&mdash;so
perhaps his sourness had more root than Weiramon&rsquo;s
windiness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About ten miles from us,&rdquo; Rand said loudly, &ldquo;a good
fifty thousand men are preparing to march.&rdquo; They were aware of
that, but it pulled every eye to him and silenced every tongue.
Weiramon&rsquo;s mouth snapped shut sourly; the fellow did love to
hear himself talk. Gueyam and Maraconn, tugging at sharp oiled
beards, smiled in anticipation, the fools. Semaradrid looked like a
man who had eaten an entire bowl of bad plums; Gregorin and the
three lords of the Nine with him merely wore grim determination on
their faces. Not fools. &ldquo;The scouts saw no signs of <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em> or <em>damane</em>,&rdquo; Rand went on, &ldquo;but even
without them, even with Asha&rsquo;man, that&rsquo;s enough to kill a
lot of us if anybody forgets the plan. No one <em>will</em> forget,
though, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo; No charges without orders, this time. He
had made that clear as glass, and hard as stone. No haring off
because you thought maybe you just might have seen something,
either.</p>

<p>Weiramon smiled, managing to put as much oil into it
as Sunamon ever could.</p>

<p>It was a simple plan, in its way. They would advance
west in five columns, each with Asha&rsquo;man, and attempt to fall
on the Seanchan from every side at once. Or as close to all sides
as could be managed. Simple plans were best, Bashere insisted. <em>
If you won&rsquo;t be satisfied with a whole litter of fat
piglets</em>, he had muttered, <em>if you have to rush into the
woods to find the old sow, then don&rsquo;t get too fancy, or
she&rsquo;ll gut you</em>.</p>

<p><em>No plan of battle survives first contact,</em>
Lews Therin said in Rand&rsquo;s head. For a moment, he still seemed
lucid. For a moment. <em>Something is wrong</em>, he growled
suddenly. His voice began to gain intensity, and drift into wild
disbelieving laughter. <em>It can&rsquo;t be wrong, but it is.
Something strange, something wrong, skittering, jumping,
twitching</em>. His cackles turned to weeping. <em>It can&rsquo;t
be! I must be mad!</em> And he vanished before Rand could mute him.
Burn him, there was nothing wrong with the plan, or Bashere would
have been on it like a duck on a beetle.</p>

<p>Lews Therin <em>was</em> mad, no doubt of it. But so
long as Rand al&rsquo;Thor remained sane&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;A bitter joke on the
world, if the Dragon Reborn went mad before the Last Battle even
began. &ldquo;Take your places,&rdquo; he commanded with a wave of the Dragon
Scepter. He had to fight down the urge to laugh at that joke.</p>

<p>The large clump of nobles broke apart at his order,
milling and muttering as they sorted themselves out. Few liked the
way Rand had divided them up. Whatever breaking down of barriers
had occurred in the shock of the first fight in the mountains, they
had sprung up again almost immediately.</p>

<p>Weiramon frowned over his undelivered speech, but
after an elaborate bow that thrust his beard at Rand like a spear
he rode north over the hills followed by Kiril Drapeneos, Bertome,
Doressin, and several minor Cairhienin lords, every last one of
them stony-faced at a Tairen being placed over them. Gedwyn rode by
Weiramon&rsquo;s side almost as if he were the one leading, and got
dark scowls for it that he affected not to notice. The other
groupings were as mixed. Gregorin also headed north, with a sullen
Sunamon trying to pretend he was heading in the same direction by
happenstance, and Dalthanes leading lesser Cairhienin behind.
Jeordwyn Semaris, another of the Nine, followed Bashere south with
Amondrid and Gueyam. Those three had accepted the Saldaean almost
eagerly for the simple reason that he was not Tairen, or
Cairhienin, or Illianer, depending on the man. Rochaid seemed to be
trying the same with Bashere that Gedwyn was with Weiramon, but
Bashere appeared to ignore it. A little way from Bashere&rsquo;s
party, Torean and Maraconn rode with their heads together, likely
venting spleen at having Semaradrid placed over them. For that
matter, Ershin Netari kept glancing toward Jeordwyn, and standing
in his stirrups to look back toward Gregorin and Kiril, though it
was improbable he could see them any longer past the hills.
Semaradrid, his back iron-rod straight, looked as unflappable as
Bashere.</p>

<p>It was the same principle Rand had used all along. He
trusted Bashere, and he thought he might be able to trust Gregorin,
and none of the others could dare think of turning against him with
so many outlanders around him, so many old enemies and so few
friends. Rand laughed softly, watching them all ride off from his
hillside. They would fight for him, and fight well, because they
had no other choice. Any more than he had.</p>

<p><em>Madness</em>, Lews Therin hissed. Rand shoved the
voice away angrily.</p>

<p>He was hardly alone, of course. Tihera and Marcolin
had most of the Defenders and Companions mounted in ranks among the
olive trees on hills flanking the one where he sat his horse. The
rest were out as a screen against surprise. A company of
blue-coated Legionmen waited patiently in the hollow below under
Masond&rsquo;s eye, and at their rear, as many men in what they had
worn surrendering on the heath back in Illian. They were trying to
emulate the Legionmen&rsquo;s calm&mdash;the other Legionmen, now&mdash;trying without a great deal of success.</p>

<p>Rand glanced at Ailil and Anaiyella. The Tairen woman
gave him a simpering smile, but it faltered weakly. The Cairhienin
woman&rsquo;s face was frost. He could not forget them, or Denharad
and their armsmen. His column, in the center, would be the largest,
and the strongest by a fair margin. A very fair margin.</p>

<p>Flinn and the men Rand had chosen out after
Dumai&rsquo;s Wells rode up the hill toward him. The balding old man
always led, though all save Adley and Narishma now wore the Dragon
as well as the Sword, and Dashiva had worn it first. In part it was
because the younger men deferred to Flinn, with his long experience
as a bannerman in the Andoran Queen&rsquo;s Guards. In part it was
because Dashiva did not seem to care. He only appeared amused by
the others. When he could spare time from talking to himself, that
was. Most often, he hardly seemed aware of anything past his own
nose.</p>

<p>For that reason, it was something of a shock when
Dashiva awkwardly booted his slab-sided mount ahead of the rest.
That plain face, so often vague or bemused with the fellow&rsquo;s
own thoughts, was fixed in a worried frown. It was <em>more</em>
than something of a shock when he seized <em>saidin</em> as soon as
he reached Rand and wove a barrier around them against
eavesdropping. Lews Therin did not waste breath&mdash;if a
disembodied voice <em>had</em> breath&mdash;on mutters about
killing; he lurched for the Source snarling wordlessly, tried to
claw the Power away from Rand. And just as abruptly fell silent and
vanished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something askew with <em>saidin</em>
here, something amiss,&rdquo; Dashiva said, sounding not at all vague. In
fact, he sounded&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;precise. And testy. A teacher lecturing a
particularly dense pupil. He even stabbed a finger at Rand. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know what it is. Nothing can twist <em>saidin</em>, and
if it could be twisted, we&rsquo;d have felt it back in the
mountains. Well, there <em>was</em> something there, yesterday, but
so small&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I feel it clearly here, though. <em>Saidin</em> is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;eager. I know; I know. <em>Saidin</em> is not alive. But it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;pulses, here. It is difficult to control.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand forced his hand to loosen its grip on the Dragon
Scepter. He had always been sure Dashiva was nearly as mad as Lews
Therin himself. Usually the man maintained a better hold on
himself, though, however precariously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been channeling
longer than you, Dashiva. You&rsquo;re just feeling the taint more.&rdquo;
He could not soften his tone. Light, he could not go mad yet, and
neither could they! &ldquo;Get to your place. We&rsquo;ll be moving soon.&rdquo;
The scouts had to return soon. Even in this flatter country, even
limited to no further than they could see, ten miles would not take
long to cover, Traveling.</p>

<p>Dashiva made no move to obey. Instead, he opened his
mouth angrily, then snapped it shut. Shaking visibly, he drew a
deep breath. &ldquo;I am well aware how long you have channeled,&rdquo; he said
in an icy, almost contemptuous voice, &ldquo;but surely even you can feel
it. Feel, man! I don&rsquo;t like &lsquo;strange&rsquo; applied to
<em>saidin</em>, and I don&rsquo;t want to die or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;or be burned
out because you&rsquo;re blind! Look at my ward! Look at it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stared. Dashiva pushing himself forward was
peculiar enough, but Dashiva in a temper? And then he did look at
the ward. Really look. The flows should have been as steady as the
threads in tight-woven canvas. They vibrated. The ward stood solid
as it should be, but the individual threads of the Power shimmered
with faint movement. Morr had said <em>saidin</em> was strange near
Ebou Dar, and for a hundred miles around. They were closer than a
hundred miles, now.</p>

<p>Rand made himself feel <em>saidin</em>. He was always
aware of the Power&mdash;anything else meant death or worse&mdash;yet he had become used to the struggle. He fought for life, but the
fight had become as natural as life. The struggle <em>was</em>
life. He made himself feel that battle, his life. Cold to make
stone shatter into dust. Fire to make stone flash to vapor. Filth
to make a rotten cesspit smell a garden in full flower. And&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a
pulsing, like something quivering in his fist. This was not the
sort of throbbing he had felt in Shadar Logoth, when the taint on
<em>saidin</em> had resonated with the evil of that place, and <em>
saidin</em> had pulsed with it. The vileness was strong, but steady
here. It was <em>saidin</em> itself that seemed full of currents
and surges. Eager, Dashiva called it, and Rand could see why.</p>

<p>Down the slope, behind Flinn, Morr scrubbed a hand
through his hair and looked around uneasily. Flinn alternated
shifting on his saddle and easing his sword in its scabbard.
Narishma, watching the sky for flying creatures, blinked too often.
A muscle twitched in Adley&rsquo;s cheek. Every one of them
displayed some sign of nervousness, and little wonder. Relief
welled up in Rand. Not madness after all.</p>

<p>Dashiva smiled, a twisted self-satisfied smile. &ldquo;I
cannot believe you didn&rsquo;t notice before.&rdquo; There was very close
to a <em>sneer</em> in his voice. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been holding <em>
saidin</em> practically day and night since we began this mad
expedition. This is a simple ward, but it did not want to form,
then it snapped together like pulling out of my hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The silver-blue slash of a gateway rotated open atop
one of the bare hills, half a mile to the west, and a Soldier
pulled his horse through and mounted hurriedly, returning from the
scout. Even at a distance, Rand could make out the faint shimmer of
the weaves surrounding the gateway before they vanished. The rider
had not reached the bottom of the hill before another gateway
opened on the crest, and then a third, a fourth, more, one after
another, almost as fast as the preceding man could get out of the
way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it did form,&rdquo; Rand said. So had the scouts&rsquo;
gateways. &ldquo;If <em>saidin</em> is hard to control, it&rsquo;s always
hard, and it still does what you want.&rdquo; But why more difficult
here? A question for another time. Light, he wished Herid Fel were
still alive; the old philosopher might have had an answer. &ldquo;Get
back with the others, Dashiva,&rdquo; he ordered, but the man stared at
him in astonishment, and he had to repeat himself before the fellow
let the ward vanish, jerked his horse around without a salute and
thumped the animal back down the slope with his heels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some trouble, my Lord Dragon?&rdquo; Anaiyella simpered.
Ailil merely looked at Rand with flat eyes.</p>

<p>Seeing the first scout on the way toward Rand, the
others fanned off to north and south, where they would join one of
the other columns. Finding them the old-fashioned way would be
faster than casting about with gateways. Drawing rein in front of
Rand, Nalaam slapped fist to chest&mdash;did he look a bit
wild-eyed? No matter. <em>Saidin</em> still did what the man
wielding it made it do. Nalaam saluted and gave his report. The
Seanchan were not encamped ten miles away, they were no more than
five or six distant, marching east. And they had <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em> and <em>damane</em> by the score.</p>

<p>Rand issued his orders as Nalaam galloped away, and
his column began moving west. The Defenders and the Companions rode
on either flank. The Legionmen marched at the rear, just behind
Denharad. A reminder to the noblewomen, and their armsmen, if they
needed one. Anaiyella certainly looked over her shoulder often
enough, and Ailil&rsquo;s refusal to was pointed. Rand formed the
main thrust of the column, Rand and Flinn and the others, just as
it would be with the other columns. Asha&rsquo;man to strike, and
men with steel to guard their backs while they killed. The sun
still had a long way to climb before midday. Nothing had changed to
alter the plan.</p>

<p><em>Madness waits for some</em>, Lews Therin
whispered. <em>It creeps up on others</em>.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Miraj rode near the head of his army marching east
along a muddy road that wound through hilly olive groves and patchy
forest. Not at the head. A full regiment, most Seanchan, rode
between him and the forward scouts. He had known generals who
wanted to be at the very front. Most were dead. Most had lost the
battles they died in. Mud kept down dust, yet word of an army on
the move ran like wildfire on the Sa&rsquo;las Plains, whatever the
land. Here and there among the olive trees he spotted an overturned
wheelbarrow or an abandoned pruning hook, but the workers had
vanished long since. Luckily, they would avoid his opponents as
much as they did him. With luck, lacking <em>raken</em>, his
opponents would not know he was on them until it was too late.
Kennar Miraj did not like trusting to luck.</p>

<p>Aside from under-officers ready to produce maps or
copy orders and messengers ready to carry them, he rode accompanied
only by Abaldar Yulan, small enough to make his quite ordinary
brown gelding seem immense, a fiery man with the nails of his
little fingers painted green who wore a black wig to conceal his
baldness, and Lisaine Jarath, a gray-haired woman from Seandar
itself, whose pale plump face and blue eyes were a study in
serenity. Yulan was not calm; Miraj&rsquo;s coal-dark Captain of the
Air often wore a scowl for the rules that seldom let him touch the
reins of a <em>raken</em> anymore, but today his frown went bone
deep. The sky was clear, perfect weather for <em>raken</em>, but by
Suroth&rsquo;s command, none of his fliers would be in the saddle
today, not here. There were too few <em>raken</em> with the Hailene
to risk them unnecessarily. Lisaine&rsquo;s calm troubled Miraj
more. More than the senior <em>der&rsquo;sul&rsquo;dam</em> under his
command, she was a friend with whom he had shared many a cup of
<em>kaf</em> and many a game of stones. An animated woman, always
bubbling over with enthusiasms and amusement. And she was icy calm,
as silent as any <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> he had tried to
question.</p>

<p>Within his sight were twenty <em>damane</em> flanking
the horsemen, each walking beside her <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>&rsquo;s
mount. The <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> bobbed in their saddles, bending
to pat a <em>damane</em>&rsquo;s head, straightening only to bend
again to stroke her hair. The <em>damane</em> looked steady enough
to his eye, but plainly the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> were on
razor&rsquo;s edge. And ebullient Lisaine rode silent as a
stone.</p>

<p>A <em>torm</em> appeared ahead, racing down the
column. Well off to the side, on the edge of the groves, yet horses
whickered and shied as the bronze-scaled creature flowed past. A
trained <em>torm</em> would not attack horses&mdash;at least not
unless the killing frenzy overtook it, the reason <em>torm</em>
were no good in battle&mdash;but horses trained to be calm around
<em>torm</em> were in as short supply as <em>torm</em>
themselves.</p>

<p>Miraj sent a skinny under-lieutenant named Varek to
fetch the <em>morat&rsquo;torm</em>&rsquo;s scouting report. Afoot,
and the Light consume whether Varek lost <em>sei&rsquo;taer</em>. He
would not waste time on Varek trying to control a mount acquired
locally. The man returned faster than he went and made a crisp bow,
beginning his report before his back was straight again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The enemy is less than five miles due east, my Lord
Captain-General, marching in our direction. They are deployed in
five columns spaced approximately one mile apart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So much for luck. But Miraj had considered how he
would attack forty thousand with only five himself, and fifty <em>
damane</em>. Quickly men were galloping with orders to deploy to
meet an attempted envelopment, and the regiments behind him began
turning into the groves, <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> riding among them
with their <em>damane</em>.</p>

<p>Gathering his cloak against a sudden cold wind, Miraj
noticed something that made him feel colder still. Lisaine was
watching the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> vanish into the trees, too. And
she had begun to sweat.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Bertome rode easily, letting the wind stream his
cloak to one side, but he studied the forested country ahead with a
wariness he barely attempted to conceal. Of his four countrymen at
his back, only Doressin was truly skilled in the Game of Houses.
That fool Tairen dog Weiramon was blind, of course. Bertome glared
at the puffed-up buffoon&rsquo;s back. Weiramon rode well ahead of
the rest in deep conversation with Gedwyn, and if Bertome needed
any further proof that the Tairen would smile at what gagged a
goat, it was how he tolerated that hot-eyed young monster. He
noticed Kiril glancing sideways at him, and reined his gray further
from the towering man. He had no particular enmity toward the
Illianer, but he did hate people looming over him. He could not
wait to return to Cairhien, where he did not have to be surrounded
by ungainly giants. Kiril Drapeneos was not blind, though, however
over-tall. He had sent a dozen scouts forward, too. Weiramon had
sent one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doressin,&rdquo; Bertome said softly, then, a little
louder, &ldquo;Doressin, you lump!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bony man gave a start in his saddle. Like
Bertome, like the other three, he had shaved and powdered the front
of his head; the style of marking yourself like a soldier had
become quite fashionable. Doressin should have called him a toad in
return, the way they had since boyhood, but instead he heeled his
gelding up beside Bertome&rsquo;s and leaned close. He was worried,
and letting it show, his forehead furrowed deeply. &ldquo;You realize the
Lord Dragon means us to die?&rdquo; he whispered, glancing at the column
trailing behind them. &ldquo;Blood and fire, I only listened to
Colavaere, but I have known I was a dead man since he killed
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment, Bertome eyed the column of armsmen,
snaking back through the rolling hills. The trees were more
scattered here than ahead, but still enough to shield an attack
until it was right on top of you. The last olive grove lay nearly a
mile behind. Weiramon&rsquo;s men rode at the fore, of course, in
those ridiculous coats with their fat white-striped sleeves, and
then Kiril&rsquo;s Illianers in enough green and red to shame
Tinkers. His own people, decently clad in dark blue beneath their
breastplates, were still beyond his sight with Doressin&rsquo;s and
the others&rsquo;, ahead only of the company of Legionmen. Weiramon
had seemed surprised that the foot kept up, though he had hardly
set a difficult pace.</p>

<p>It was not really the armsmen Bertome glanced at,
though. Seven men rode before even Weiramon&rsquo;s, seven men with
hard faces and death-cold eyes, in black coats. One wore a pin in
the shape of a silver sword on his tall collar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An elaborate way to go about it,&rdquo; he told Doressin
dryly. &ldquo;And I doubt al&rsquo;Thor would have sent those fellows with
us, if we were just being fed into a sausage grinder.&rdquo; Forehead
still creased, Doressin opened his mouth again, but Bertome said,
&ldquo;I need to talk to the Tairen.&rdquo; He disliked seeing his childhood
friend this way. Al&rsquo;Thor had unhinged him.</p>

<p>Absorbed in one another, Weiramon and Gedwyn did not
hear him riding up on them. Gedwyn was idly playing with his reins,
his features cold with contempt. The Tairen was red-faced. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t care who you are,&rdquo; he was saying to the black-coated man
in a low, hard voice, spittle flying, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t take more risk
without a command direct from the lips of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly the pair became aware of Bertome, and
Weiramon&rsquo;s mouth snapped shut. He glared as if he wanted to
kill Bertome. The Asha&rsquo;man&rsquo;s ever-present smile melted
away. The wind gusted, cold and sharp as clouds drifted across the
sun, but no colder than Gedwyn&rsquo;s sudden stare. With a small
shock Bertome realized the man also wanted to strike him dead on
the spot.</p>

<p>Gedwyn&rsquo;s icily murderous gaze did not change,
but Weiramon&rsquo;s face underwent a remarkable transformation. The
red faded slowly as he produced a smile in an instant, an oily
smile with only a trace of mocking condescension. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
thinking about you, Bertome,&rdquo; he said heartily. &ldquo;A pity
al&rsquo;Thor strangled your cousin. With his own hands, I hear.
Frankly, I was surprised you came when he called. I&rsquo;ve seen
him watching you. I fear he plans something more&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;interesting&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;for you than thrashing your heels on the floor while his
fingers tighten on your throat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bertome suppressed a sigh, and not only at the
fool&rsquo;s clumsiness. A good many thought to manipulate him with
Colavaere&rsquo;s death. She had been his favorite cousin, but
ambitious beyond reason. Saighan had good claims to the Sun Throne,
yet she could not have held it against the strength of Riatin or
Damodred either one, let alone both together, not without the open
blessings of the White Tower or the Dragon Reborn. Still, she <em>
had</em> been his favorite. What did Weiramon want? Certainly not
what it seemed on the surface. Even this Tairen oaf was not <em>
that</em> simple.</p>

<p>Before he could frame any response, a horseman came
galloping toward them through the trees ahead. A Cairhienin, and as
he reined to a sudden halt in front of them that made his horse
sit back on its haunches, Bertome recognized one of his own
armsmen, a gap-toothed fellow with seamed scars on both cheeks.
Doile, he thought. From the Colchaine estates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord Bertome,&rdquo; the fellow panted, bowing hastily.
&ldquo;There are two thousand Taraboners hard on my heels. And women with
them! With lightning on their dresses!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hard on his heels,&rdquo; Weiramon murmured disparagingly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see what my man has to say when he gets back. I
certainly don&rsquo;t see any&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sudden whoops in the near distance ahead cut him off,
and the thunder of hooves, and then quickly galloping lancers
appeared, a flowing tide spreading through the trees. Straight
toward Bertome and the others.</p>

<p>Weiramon laughed. &ldquo;Kill whoever you wish, wherever
you wish, Gedwyn,&rdquo; he said, drawing sword with a flourish. &ldquo;I use
the methods I use, and that&rsquo;s that!&rdquo; Racing back toward his
armsmen, he waved the blade over his head shouting, &ldquo;Saniago!
Saniago and glory!&rdquo; It was no surprise he did not add a shout for
his country to those for his House and his greatest love.</p>

<p>Spurring in the same direction, Bertome raised his
own voice. &ldquo;Saighan and Cairhien!&rdquo; No need for sword waving yet.
&ldquo;Saighan and Cairhien!&rdquo; What <em>had</em> the man been after?</p>

<p>Thunder rumbled, and Bertome looked to the sky,
perplexed. There were few more clouds than earlier. No; Doile&mdash;Dalyn?&mdash;had mentioned those women. And then he forgot
all about whatever the fool Tairen wanted as steel-veiled
Taraboners poured over the wooded hills toward him, the earth
blooming fire and the sky raining lightning ahead of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Saighan and Cairhien!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>

<p>The wind rose.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Horsemen clashed amid thick trees and heavy
underbrush, where shadows hung heavily. The light seemed to be
failing, the clouds thickening overhead, but it was hard to say
with the dense forest canopy for a roof. Booming roars half-drowned
the ring of steel on steel, the shouts of men, the screams of
horses. Sometimes the ground shook. Sometimes the enemy raised
shouts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Den Lushenos! Den Lushenos and the Bees!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Annallin! Rally to Annallin!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haellin! Haellin! For the High Lord Sunamon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The last was the only cry Varek understood in the
least, though he suspected any of the locals who named themselves
High Lords or Ladies might not be offered the chance to swear the
Oath.</p>

<p>He jerked his sword free from where he had jammed it
into his opponent&rsquo;s armpit, just above the breastplate, and
let the pale little man topple. A dangerous fighter, until he made
the mistake of raising his blade too high. The man&rsquo;s bay
crashed off through the undergrowth, and Varek spared a moment for
regret. The animal looked better than the white-footed dun he was
forced to ride. A moment only, and then he was peering through the
close-set trees, where it seemed vines dangled from half the
branches and bunches of some gray, feathery plant from nearly
all.</p>

<p>Sounds of battle rose from every direction, but at
first he could see nothing that moved. Then a dozen Altaran lancers
appeared at fifty paces, walking their horses and peering about
carefully, though the way they talked loudly among themselves more
than justified the red slashes crisscrossing their breastplates.
Varek gathered his reins, meaning to take them in. An escort, even
this undisciplined rabble, might be the difference between the
urgent message he carried reaching Banner-General Chianmai and
not.</p>

<p>Black streaks flashed from among the trees, emptying
Altaran saddles. Their horses dashed in every direction as the
riders fell, and then there were only a dozen corpses sprawled on
the damp carpet of dead leaves, at least one crossbow bolt jutting
from every man. Nothing moved. Varek shivered in spite of himself.
Those foot in blue coats had seemed easy at first, with no pikes to
stand behind, but they never came into the open, hiding behind
trees, in dips in the ground. They were not the worst. He had been
sure after the frantic retreat to the ships at Falme that he had
seen the worse he ever could see, the Ever Victorious Army in a
rout. Not half an hour gone, though, he had seen a hundred
Taraboners face one lone man in a black coat. A hundred lancers
against one, and the Taraboners had been ripped to shreds.
Literally ripped to shreds, men and horses simply exploding as fast
he could count; the slaughter had continued after the Taraboners
turned to flee, went on so long as one of them remained in sight.
Perhaps it was really no worse than having the ground erupt beneath
your feet, but at least <em>damane</em> usually left enough of you
to be buried.</p>

<p>He had been told by the last man he managed to speak
to in these woods, a grizzled veteran from home leading a hundred
Amadician pikes, that Chianmai was in this direction. Ahead, he
spotted riderless horses tied to trees, and men afoot. Maybe they
could give him further direction. And he would give them the lash
of his tongue for standing about while a battle raged.</p>

<p>When he rode in among them, he forgot
tongue-lashings. He had found what he was looking for, but not at
all what he wanted to find. A dozen badly burned corpses lay in a
row. One, his honey-brown face untouched, was recognizably
Chianmai. The men on their feet were all Taraboners, Amadicians,
Altarans. Some of them were injured, too. The only Seanchan was a
tight-faced <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> soothing a weeping <em>
damane</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happened here?&rdquo; Varek demanded. He did not
think it was like these Asha&rsquo;man to leave survivors. Maybe the
<em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> had fought him off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madness, my lord.&rdquo; A hulking Taraboner shrugged away
the man who was spreading ointment down his seared left arm. The
sleeve appeared to have been burned away clear to the fellow&rsquo;s
breastplate, yet despite his burns, he did not grimace. His veil of
steel mail hung by a corner from his red-plumed conical helmet,
baring a hard face with thick gray mustaches that nearly hid his
mouth, and his eyes were insultingly direct. &ldquo;A group of Illianers,
they fell on us without warning. At first, all went well. They had
none of the blackcoats with them. Lord Chianmai, he led us bravely,
and the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the woman&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;channeled lightnings. Then, just as
the Illianers broke, the lightnings, they fell among us, too.&rdquo; He
cut off with a significant look at the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>.</p>

<p>She was on her feet in an instant, shaking her free
fist and striding as far toward the Taraboner as the leash attached
to her other wrist would allow. Her <em>damane</em> lay in a
weeping heap. &ldquo;I will not hear this dog&rsquo;s words against my
Zakai! She is a good <em>damane</em>! A good <em>damane</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Varek made soothing gestures to the woman. He had
seen <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> make their charges howl for misdeeds,
and a few who crippled the recalcitrant, but most would bristle
even at one of the Blood who cast aspersions on a favorite. This
Taraboner was not of the Blood, and by the look of the quivering
<em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>, she was ready to do murder. Had the man
voiced his ridiculous, unspoken charge, Varek thought she might
have killed him on the spot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prayers for the dead must wait,&rdquo; Varek said bluntly.
What he was about to do would end with him in the hands of the
Seekers, if he failed, but there was not a Seanchan left standing
here except the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>. &ldquo;I am assuming command. We
will disengage and turn south.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Disengage!&rdquo; the heavy-shouldered Taraboner barked.
&ldquo;It will take us <em>days</em> to <em>disengage</em>! The
Illianers, they fight like badgers backed into a corner, the
Cairhienin like ferrets in a box. The Tairens, they are not so hard
as I have heard, but there are maybe a dozen of these
Asha&rsquo;man, yes? I do not even know where three-quarters of my
men are, in this jolly-bag!&rdquo; Emboldened by his example, the others
began giving protest, too.</p>

<p>Varek ignored them. And forbore asking what a
&ldquo;jolly-bag&rdquo; was; looking at the tangled forest all around,
listening to the clash of battle, the booms of explosions and
lightnings, he could imagine. &ldquo;You will gather your men and begin
pulling back,&rdquo; he said loudly, cutting through their chatter. &ldquo;Not
too fast; you will act in unison.&rdquo; Miraj&rsquo;s orders to Chianmai
said &ldquo;with all possible speed&rdquo;&mdash;he had memorized them, in
case something happened to the copy in his saddlebags&mdash;&ldquo;all
possible speed,&rdquo; but too much speed in this, and half the men would
be left behind, chopped to flinders at the enemy&rsquo;s leisure.
&ldquo;Now, move! You fight for the Empress, may she live forever!&rdquo;</p>

<p>That last was the sort of thing you told fresh
recruits, but for some reason, the listening men jerked as if he
had struck them all with his quirt. Bowing quickly and deeply,
hands on knees, they all but flew to their horses. Strange. Now it
was up to him to find the Seanchan units. One of those would be
commanded by someone above him, and he could pass his
responsibility.</p>

<p>The <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> was on her knees, stroking
her still weeping <em>damane</em>&rsquo;s hair and crooning softly.
&ldquo;Get her soothed down,&rdquo; he told her. With all possible speed. And
he thought he had seen a touch of anxiety in Miraj&rsquo;s eyes.
What could make Kennar Miraj anxious? &ldquo;I think we will be depending
on you <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> to the south.&rdquo; Now, why would that
make the blood drain from her face?</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Bashere stood just inside the edge of the trees,
frowning through his helmet&rsquo;s face-bars at what he saw. His
bay nuzzled his shoulder. He held his cloak close against the wind.
More to avoid any motion that would draw eyes than for the cold,
though that chilled his flesh. It would have been a spring breeze
back in Saldaea, but months in the southlands had softened him.
Shining bright between gray clouds that sailed along quickly, the
sun still lay a little short of midday. And ahead of him. Just
because you began a battle facing west did not mean you ended it
that way. Before him lay a broad pasture where flocks of
black-and-white goats cropped at the brown grass in desultory
fashion just as if there was no battle raging all around them. Not
that there was any sign of it here. For the moment. A man could get
himself cut to doll rags crossing that meadow. And in the trees,
whether forest or olive groves or thickets, you did not always see
the enemy before you were on top of him, scouts or no scouts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we&rsquo;re going to cross,&rdquo; Gueyam muttered,
rubbing a wide hand over his bald head, &ldquo;we should cross.
Light&rsquo;s truth, we&rsquo;re wasting time.&rdquo; Amondrid snapped his
mouth shut; likely, the moon-faced Cairhienin had been about to say
much the same thing. He would agree with a Tairen when horses
climbed trees.</p>

<p>Jeordwyn Semaris snorted. The man should have grown a
beard to hide that narrow jaw. It made his head look like a
forester&rsquo;s splitting wedge. &ldquo;I do say go around,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost enough men to those Light-cursed <em>damane</em>,
and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He trailed off with an uneasy glance toward
Rochaid.</p>

<p>The young Asha&rsquo;man stood by himself, mouth
tight, fingering that Dragon pin on his collar. Maybe wondering
whether it was worth it, by the look of him. There was no knowing
air about the boy now, only frowning worry.</p>

<p>Leading Quick by the reins, Bashere strode to the
Asha&rsquo;man and drew him farther aside in the trees. Pushed him
farther aside. Rochaid scowled, going reluctantly. The man was tall
enough to loom over Bashere, but Bashere was having none of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I count on your people next time?&rdquo; Bashere
demanded, jerking a mustache in irritation. &ldquo;No delays?&rdquo; Rochaid
and his fellows seemed to have grown slower and slower responding
when they found themselves opposite <em>damane</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what I&rsquo;m about, Bashere,&rdquo; Rochaid
snarled. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we killing enough of them for you? As far as
I can see, we&rsquo;re about done!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bashere nodded slowly. Not in agreement with the
last. There were plenty of enemy soldiers left, almost anywhere you
looked hard enough. But a good many <em>were</em> dead. He had
patterned his movements on what he had studied of the Trolloc Wars,
when the forces of the Light seldom came anywhere near the numbers
they had to face. Slash at the flanks, and run. Slash at the rear,
and run. Slash and run, and when the enemy chased after, turn on
the ground you had chosen beforehand, where the legionmen lay
waiting with their crossbows, turn and cut at him until it was time
to run again. Or until he broke. Already today he had broken
Taraboners, Amadicians, Altarans <em>and</em> these Seanchan in
their strange armor. He had seen more enemy dead than in any fight
since the Blood Snow. But if he had Asha&rsquo;man, the other side
had those <em>damane</em>. A good third of his Saldaeans lay dead
along the miles behind. Nearly half his force was dead, all told,
and there were still more Seanchan out there with their cursed
women, and Taraboners, and Amadicians and Altarans. They just kept
coming, more appearing as soon as he finished the last. And the
Asha&rsquo;man were growing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;hesitant.</p>

<p>Swinging into Quick&rsquo;s saddle, he rode back to
Jeordwyn and the others. &ldquo;We go around,&rdquo; he ordered, ignoring
Jeordwyn&rsquo;s nods as much as he did Gueyam and Amondrid&rsquo;s
scowls. &ldquo;Triple scouts out. I mean to push hard, but I don&rsquo;t
want to trip over a <em>damane</em>.&rdquo; No one laughed.</p>

<p>Rochaid had gathered the other five Asha&rsquo;man
around him, one with a silver sword pinned to his collar, the
others without. There had been two more with bare collars when they
started out that morning, but if Asha&rsquo;man knew how to kill, so
did <em>damane</em>. Waving his arms angrily, Rochaid appeared to
be arguing with them. His face was red, theirs blank and stubborn.
Bashere just hoped Rochaid could keep all of them from deserting.
Today had been costly enough without adding that sort of man
wandering about loose.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">A light rain fell. Rand scowled at the thick black
clouds gathering the sky, already beginning to obscure a pale sun
halfway down to the far horizon. Light rain now, but it would
thicken like those clouds! Irritably he returned to studying the
land ahead of him. The Crown of Swords pricked his temples. With
the Power in him, the land was clear as a map despite the weather.
Clear enough, anyway. Hills sinking away, some covered with
thickets or olive trees, others bare grass or just stone and weeds.
He thought he saw movement at the edge of a copse, then again among
the rows of an olive orchard on another hill a mile from the copse.
Thinking was not enough. Dead men lay across the miles behind, dead
enemies. Dead women, too, he knew, but he had stayed away from
anywhere <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> and <em>damane</em> had died,
refused to see their faces. Most thought it was hatred for those
who killed so many of his followers.</p>

<p>Tai&rsquo;daishar frisked a few steps on the hilltop
before Rand settled him with a firm hand and the pressure of his
knees. A fine thing if a <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> spotted <em>his</em>
movement. The few trees around him were not enough to hide much.
Vaguely, he realized he did not recognize a one of them.
Tai&rsquo;daishar tossed his head. Rand tucked the Dragon Scepter
into his saddlebags, just the carved butt-end sticking out, to free
both hands in case the gelding was not satisfied. He could have
taken weariness from the horse with <em>saidin</em>, but he knew no
way to make it obey with the Power.</p>

<p>He could not see how the gelding retained enough
energy. <em>Saidin</em> filled him, bubbled in him, but his
distantly felt body wanted to sag with weariness. Part of that was
the sheer amount of the Power he had handled today. Part was the
strain of fighting <em>saidin</em> to make it do what he wanted.
Always, <em>saidin</em> had to be conquered, forced, but never
before like today. The half-healed, never-healing wounds in his
left side were agony, the older an auger trying to drill through
the Void, the newer a blaze of raw flame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was an accident, my Lord Dragon,&rdquo; Adley said
suddenly. &ldquo;I swear it was!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut up and watch!&rdquo; Rand told him harshly.
Adley&rsquo;s eyes sank to his hands on his own reins for a moment,
then he raked damp hair out of his face and jerked his head up
obediently.</p>

<p>Today, here, controlling <em>saidin</em> was harder
than ever, but letting it slip anytime, anywhere, could kill you.
Adley had let it slip, and men had died in uncontrolled bursts of
fire, not just the Amadicians he had been aiming at, but near
thirty of Ailil&rsquo;s armsmen and almost as many of
Anaiyella&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Except for his slip, Adley would have been with Morr,
with the Companions in the woods half a mile to the south. Narishma
and Hopwil were with the Defenders, to the north. Rand wanted Adley
under his eye. Had any other &ldquo;accidents&rdquo; happened, out of his
sight? He could not watch everyone, all the time. Flinn&rsquo;s face
was grim as day-old death, and Dashiva, far from looking vague,
seemed on the point of sweating with concentration. He still
muttered to himself under his breath, so low Rand could not hear
even with the Power in him, but the man mopped rain from his face
continually with a sodden lace-edged linen handkerchief that had
grown more than grimy as the day wore on. Rand did not think they
had slipped. In any case, neither they nor Adley held the Power
now. Nor would until he instructed them to seize it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it done?&rdquo; Anaiyella asked behind him.</p>

<p>Heedless of who might be watching out there, Rand
wheeled Tai&rsquo;daishar around to face her. The Tairen woman
started back in her saddle, the hood of her richly elaborate rain
cape falling to her shoulders. Her cheek gave a twitch. Her eyes
might have been full of fear, or hate. At her side, Ailil fingered
her reins calmly with red-gloved hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What more can you want?&rdquo; the smaller woman asked in
a cool voice. A lady being polite to a menial. Barely. &ldquo;If the size
of a victory is accounted by dead enemies, I think today alone will
put your name in the histories.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean to drive the Seanchan into the sea!&rdquo; Rand
snapped. Light, he <em>had</em> to finish them now, when he had the
chance! He could not fight the Seanchan and the Forsaken and the
Light alone knew who or what else, all at the same time! &ldquo;I did it
before, and I will again!&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Do you have the Horn of Valere hidden in your
pocket this time?</em> Lews Therin asked slyly. Rand snarled at him
silently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s someone below,&rdquo; Flinn said suddenly.
&ldquo;Riding up this way. From the west.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand pulled his mount back around. Legionmen ringed
the slopes of the hill, though they hid well enough that he seldom
caught sight of a blue coat. None of them had a horse. Who would be
riding&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bashere&rsquo;s bay trotted up the slope almost as
though it were level ground. Bashere&rsquo;s helmet hung from his
saddle, and the man himself looked tired. Without preamble, he
spoke in a flat voice. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re finished, here. Part of fighting
is knowing when to go, and it&rsquo;s time. I&rsquo;ve left five
hundred dead behind, near enough, and two of your Soldiers for
salt. I sent three more to find Semaradrid, Gregorin and Weiramon
and tell them to rally on you. I doubt they&rsquo;re in any better
condition than I am. How does <em>your</em> butcher&rsquo;s bill
run?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand ignored the question. His own dead topped
Bashere&rsquo;s by close to two hundred. &ldquo;You had no right sending
orders to the others. So long as there are half a dozen
Asha&rsquo;man left&mdash;so long as there&rsquo;s me!&mdash;I have
enough! I mean to find the rest of the Seanchan army and destroy
it, Bashere. I won&rsquo;t let them add Altara to Tarabon and
Amadicia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bashere knuckled his thick mustaches with a wry
laugh. &ldquo;You want to find them. Look out there.&rdquo; He swept a
gauntleted hand across the hills to the west. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t point
to a particular spot, but there are ten, maybe fifteen thousand
close enough to see from here, if those trees weren&rsquo;t in the
way. I danced with the Dark One getting through them unseen to
reach you. Maybe a hundred <em>damane</em> down there. Maybe more.
More coming, for sure, and more men. Seems their general has
decided to concentrate on you. I suppose it isn&rsquo;t always
cheese and ale being <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;re out there&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Rand scanned the
hills. The rain fell more heavily. Where had he seen movement?
Light, he was tired. <em>Saidin</em> hammered at him. Unconsciously
he touched the wrapped bundled beneath his stirrup leather. His
hand jerked away of its own accord. Ten thousand, even fifteen&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Once Semaradrid reached him, and Gregorin, and Weiramon&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;More important, once the rest of the Asha&rsquo;man did&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;If
they&rsquo;re out there, that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ll destroy them,
Bashere. I&rsquo;ll hit them from all sides, the way we intended in
the first place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frowning, Bashere reined his horse closer, until his
knee almost touched Rand&rsquo;s. Flinn moved his mount away, but
Adley was too focused on staring through the rain to notice
anything so near, and Dashiva, still wiping his face incessantly,
stared with open interest. Bashere lowered his voice to a murmur.
&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t thinking straight. That was a good plan, in the
beginning, but their general thinks fast. He spread out to blunt
our attacks before we could fall on him spread out marching.
We&rsquo;ve cost him even so, it seems, and he now he&rsquo;s pulling
everything together. You won&rsquo;t catch him by surprise. He <em>
wants</em> us to come at him. He&rsquo;s out there <em>waiting</em>
for it. Asha&rsquo;man or no Asha&rsquo;man, if we stand nose-to-nose
with this fellow, I think maybe the vultures grow fat and nobody
rides away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody stands nose-to-nose with the Dragon Reborn,&rdquo;
Rand growled. &ldquo;The Forsaken could tell him that, whoever he is.
Right, Flinn? Dashiva?&rdquo; Flinn nodded uncertainly. Dashiva flinched.
&ldquo;You think I can&rsquo;t surprise him, Bashere? Watch!&rdquo; Pulling the
long bundle loose, he stripped away the cloth covering, and Rand
heard gasps as raindrops glistened on a sword seemingly made of
crystal. The Sword That Is Not a Sword. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if
he&rsquo;s surprised by <em>Callandor</em> in the hands of the
Dragon Reborn, Bashere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cradling the translucent blade in the crook of his
elbow, Rand rode Tai&rsquo;daishar forward a few steps. There was no
reason to. He had no clearer view from there. Except&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Something spidered across the outer surface of the Void, a
wriggling black web. He was afraid. The last time he had used <em>
Callandor</em>, really used it, he had tried to bring the dead back
to life. He had been sure he could do anything, then, anything at
all. Like a madman thinking he could fly. But he was the Dragon
Reborn. He <em>could</em> do anything. Had he not proved it time
and again? He reached for the Source through the Sword That Is Not
a Sword.</p>

<p><em>Saidin</em> seemed to leap into <em>
Callandor</em> before he touched the Source through it. From pommel
to point, the crystal sword shone with a white light. He had only
thought the Power filled him before. Now he held more than ten men
could have unaided, a hundred, he did not know how many. The fires
of the sun, searing through his head. The cold of all of the
winters of all the Ages, eating into his heart. In that torrent,
the taint was all the midden heaps in the world emptying into his
soul. <em>Saidin</em> still tried to kill him, tried to scour away,
burn away, freeze away, every scrap of him, but he fought, and he
lived for a moment more, and another moment, another. He wanted to
laugh. He <em>could</em> do anything!</p>

<p>Once, holding <em>Callandor</em>, he had made a
weapon that searched out Shadowspawn through the Stone of Tear,
struck them dead with hunting lightning wherever they stood or ran
or hid. Surely there must be something like that, to use against
his enemies here. But when he called to Lews Therin, only anguished
whimpers answered, as if that disembodied voice feared the pain of
<em>saidin</em>.</p>

<p>With <em>Callandor</em> blazing in his hand&mdash;he
did not remember raising the blade overhead&mdash;he stared at the
hills where his enemies hid. They were gray now, with thickening
rain, and dense black clouds blocking the sun. What was it he had
told Eagan Padros?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the storm,&rdquo; he whispered&mdash;a shout in his
ears, a roar&mdash;and he channeled.</p>

<p>Overhead, the clouds boiled. Where they had been the
black of soot, they became midnight, the heart of midnight. He did
not know what he was channeling. So often, he did not, in spite of
Asmodean&rsquo;s teaching. Maybe Lews Therin was guiding him, in
spite of the man&rsquo;s weeping. Flows of <em>saidin</em> spun
across the sky, Wind and Water and Fire. Fire. The sky truly did
rain lightning. A hundred bolts at once, hundreds, forked
blue-white shafts stabbing down as far as he could see. The hills
before him erupted. Some flew apart under the torrent of lightning
like kicked anthills. Flames sprang up in thickets, trees turning
to torches in the rain, flames racing through olive orchards.</p>

<p>Something struck him hard, and he realized he was
picking himself up from the ground. The crown had fallen from his
head. <em>Callandor</em> still blazed in his hand, though. Vaguely,
he was aware of Tai&rsquo;daishar scrambling to his feet, trembling.
So they thought to strike back at him, did they.</p>

<p>Shoving <em>Callandor</em> high, he screamed at them.
&ldquo;Come against me, if you dare! I <em>am</em> the storm! Come if you
dare, Shai&rsquo;tan! I am the Dragon Reborn!&rdquo; A thousand sizzling
lightning bolts hailed down from the clouds.</p>

<p>Again something struck him down. He tried to fight up
again. Callandor, still shining, lay a pace from his outstretched
hand. The sky shattered with lightnings. Suddenly, he realized that
the weight atop him was Bashere, that the man was shaking him. It
must have been Bashere who had flung him down!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; the Saldaean shouted. Blood fanned down
his face from a split across his scalp. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re killing us,
man! Stop!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand turned his head, and one stunned look was
enough. Lightnings flashed <em>all</em> around him, in <em>
every</em> direction. A bolt stabbed down onto the reverse slope,
where Denharad and the armsmen were; the screams of men and horses
rose. Anaiyella and Ailil were both afoot, trying vainly to quiet
mounts that reared, eyes rolling, trying to rip reins free. Flinn
was bending over someone, not far from a dead horse with legs
already stiff.</p>

<p>Rand let <em>saidin</em> go. He let it go, but for
moments it still flowed into him, and lightning raged. The flow
into him dwindled, tailed off and vanished. Dizziness swept through
him in its place. For three more heartbeats, two of <em>
Callandor</em> shone where they lay on the ground, and lightning
fell. Then, silence except for the rising drum of the rain. And the
screams from behind the hill.</p>

<p>Slowly Bashere climbed off of him, and Rand rose
unaided on tottering legs, blinking as his sight returned to
normal. The Saldaean watched him as he might have a rabid lion,
fingering his sword hilt. Anaiyella took one look at Rand on his
feet and collapsed in a faint; her horse dashed away, reins
dangling. Ailil, still fighting her rearing animal, spared few
glances for Rand. Rand let <em>Callandor</em> lie where it was for
the moment. He was not sure he dared pick it up. Not yet.</p>

<p>Flinn straightened, shaking his head, then stood
silently as Rand went unsteadily to stand beside him. The rain fell
on Jonan Adley&rsquo;s sightless eyes, bulging as if in horror.
Jonan had been one of the first. Those screams from behind the hill
seemed to slice through the rain. How many more, Rand wondered.
Among the Defenders? The Companions? Among&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?</p>

<p>Rain thick as a blanket hid the hills where the
Seanchan army lay. Had he hurt them at all, striking out blindly?
Or were they still waiting out there with all their <em>
damane</em>? Waiting to see how many more of his own he could kill
for them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Set whatever guard you think we need,&rdquo; Rand told
Bashere. His voice was iron. One of the first. His heart was iron.
&ldquo;When Gregorin and the others reach us, we&rsquo;ll Travel to where
the carts are waiting as fast as we can.&rdquo; Bashere nodded without
speaking, and turned away in the rain.</p>

<p><em>I&rsquo;ve lost</em>, Rand thought dully. <em>
I&rsquo;m the Dragon Reborn, but for the first time, I&rsquo;ve
lost</em>.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Lews Therin raged up inside him, sly digs
forgotten. <em>I&rsquo;ve</em> never <em>been defeated</em>, he
snarled. <em>I am the Lord of the Morning!</em> No <em>one can
defeat me!</em></p>

<p>Rand sat in the rain, turning the Crown of Swords in
his hands, looking at <em>Callandor</em> lying in the mud. He let
Lews Therin rage.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Abaldar Yulan wept, grateful for the downpour that
hid the tears on his cheeks. Someone would have to give the order.
Eventually someone would have to apologize to the Empress, might
she live forever, and maybe to Suroth sooner. Those were not why he
wept, though, nor even for a dead comrade. Roughly ripping a sleeve
from his coat, he laid it across Miraj&rsquo;s staring eyes so the
rain would not fall in them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send out orders for retreat,&rdquo; Yulan ordered, and saw
the men standing around him jerk. For the second time on these
shores, the Ever Victorious Army had suffered a devastating defeat,
and Yulan did not think he was the only one who wept.</p>
