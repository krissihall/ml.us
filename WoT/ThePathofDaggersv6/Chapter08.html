<h4><em>A Simple Country Woman</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
camp lay about a league farther on, well back
from the road among low, wooded hills, just beyond a stream that
was ten paces&rsquo; width of stones and only five of water never
deeper than a man&rsquo;s knees. Tiny green and silver fish darted
away from the horses&rsquo; hooves. Casual passersby were unlikely
to come on them here. The nearest inhabited farm was over a mile
away, and Perrin had checked personally to make sure those folk
took their animals to water elsewhere.</p>

<p>He truly had been trying to avoid notice as much as
possible, traveling by back roads and the smallest country paths
when they could not keep to the forests. A futile effort, really.
The horses could be pastured wherever there was grass, but they
required at least some grain, and even a small army had to buy
food, and a lot of it. Every man needed four pounds a day, in flour
and beans and meat. Rumors must have been floating all over
Ghealdan, though with luck, no one suspected who they were. Perrin
grimaced. Perhaps they had not, until he went and opened his mouth.
Still, he would have done nothing differently.</p>

<p>It was three camps really, close to one another and
none far from the stream. They traveled together, all following
him, obeying him supposedly, but there were too many personalities
involved, and no one was entirely sure the others aimed at the same
goal. Some nine hundred or so Winged Guards had their cook fires
crowded between rows of picketed horses in a broad meadow of
trampled brown grass. He tried to close his nose to the mingled
smells of horses, sweat, dung and boiling goat meat, an unpleasant
combination on a hot day. A dozen mounted sentries rode a slow
circuit in pairs, their long, red-streamered lances all at
precisely the same angle, but the rest of the Mayeners had shed
breastplates and helmets. Coatless and often shirtless in the sun,
they lay sprawled on their blankets or diced as they waited on the
food. Some looked up as Perrin passed, a number straightened from
what they were doing to study the additions to his party, but none
came running, so the patrols were still out. Small patrols, without
lances, who could see without being seen. Well, that was the hope.
It had been.</p>

<p>A handful of <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> moved at various
chores among the Wise Ones&rsquo; low gray-brown tents on the
sparsely wooded crest of the hill above the Mayeners. At this
distance, the white-robed figures appeared harmless, eyes downcast
and meek. Up close, they would look the same, but most were Shaido.
The Wise Ones claimed <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> were <em>
gai&rsquo;shain</em>; Perrin did not trust any Shaido out of his
sight. Off to one side on the slope, beneath a bedraggled sourgum,
perhaps a dozen Maidens in <em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em> knelt in a
circle around Sulin, the toughest of them despite her white hair.
She had sent out scouts, too, women who could move as fast afoot as
the Mayeners on their horses and were much more likely to escape
unwanted attention. None of the Wise Ones up there were in the
open, but a slender woman stirring a large stew kettle
straightened, knuckling her back as she watched Perrin and the
others pass. A woman in a green silk riding dress.</p>

<p>He could see the glare on Masuri&rsquo;s face. Aes
Sedai did not stir kettles, nor perform twenty other tasks the Wise
Ones had her and Seonid doing. Masuri laid it at Rand&rsquo;s feet,
but he was not here, and Perrin was. Given half a chance, she would
peel his hide for him.</p>

<p>Edarra and Nevarin turned up that way, even in those
bulky skirts barely disturbing the layers of dead leaves that
carpeted the ground. Seonid followed, her cheeks still bulging
around that scarf. She twisted in her saddle, peering back at
Perrin. If he could have believed an Aes Sedai looking anxious,
that was what he would have called her. Riding behind her, Furen
and Teryl wore scowls.</p>

<p>Masuri saw them coming and hastily bent back to the
black kettle, stirring with renewed vigor, trying to make out that
she had never stopped. So long as Masuri stayed in the Wise
Ones&rsquo; charge, Perrin thought he did not have to worry about
his hide. The Wise Ones seemed to keep a very short leash.</p>

<p>Nevarin looked back over her shoulder at him, another
of those dark stares he had been getting from her and Edarra since
sending his warning, his threat, by the stubble-cheeked fellow.
Perrin exhaled in exasperation. He did not have to worry about his
pelt unless the Wise Ones decided <em>they</em> wanted it. Too many
personalities. Too many goals.</p>

<p>Maighdin rode at Faile&rsquo;s side, seemingly paying
no attention to what they passed, but he would not have wagered a
split copper on it. Her eyes had widened a hair at sight of the
Mayener sentries. She knew what red breastplates and helmets like
rimmed pots meant, as surely as she had recognized an Aes Sedai
face. Most people would not have known either, especially not folk
dressed as she was. She was a mystery, this Maighdin. For some
reason, she seemed vaguely familiar.</p>

<p>Lini and Tallanvor&mdash;that was what he had heard
Maighdin call the fellow who had ridden after her; &ldquo;young&rdquo;
Tallanvor, though there could not have been more than four or five
years between them if that&mdash;stayed as close behind Maighdin
as possible, with Aram in the way trying to heel Perrin. So did a
little stick of a fellow with a pursed mouth, called Balwer, who
seemed to pay less heed to their surroundings than Maighdin
pretended. Even so, Perrin thought Balwer saw more than she did. He
could not say why, precisely, but the few times he had caught the
bony little man&rsquo;s scent, he had been minded of a wolf testing
the air. Strangely, there was no fear in Balwer, only quickly
suppressed ridges of irritation shot through with the quivery smell
of impatience. The remainder of Maighdin&rsquo;s companions trailed
along well back. The third woman, Breane, was whispering fiercely
to a hulking fellow who kept his eyes down and sometimes nodded
silently, sometimes shook his head. A shoulder-striker and street
tough if ever there was one, but the short woman had an edge of
toughness about her, too. The last man sheltered behind those two,
a stout man with a battered straw hat pulled low to hide his face.
On him, the sword the men all wore looked as strange as it did on
Balwer.</p>

<p>The third part of the camp, spread out among the
trees just around the curve of the hill from the Mayeners, covered
as much ground as the Winged Guards&rsquo; though it held far fewer
people. Here, the horses were picketed well away from the cook
fires, so the unblemished smell of dinner filled the air. Roasting
goat, this time, and hard turnips the farmers probably had intended
to feed to their pigs even with times as hard as they were. Close
on to three hundred Two Rivers men who had followed Perrin away
from home were tending meat on spits, mending clothes, checking
over arrows and bows, all scattered in haphazard clumps of five or
six friends around a fire. Nearly every one of them waved and
shouted greetings, though there was too much of &ldquo;Lord Perrin&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Perrin Goldeneyes&rdquo; to suit him. Faile had a right to the titles
they gave her.</p>

<p>Grady and Neald, unsweating in their night-black
coats, did not cheer; standing beside the cook fire they had built
a little away from everyone else, they merely looked at him.
Expectant looks, he thought. Expecting what? That was the question
he always asked himself about them. The Asha&rsquo;man made him
uneasy, more than Aes Sedai or Wise Ones. Women channeling the
Power was natural, if not exactly anything a man could be
comfortable around. Plain-faced Grady appeared a farmer despite his
coat and sword, and Neald a popinjay with his curled mustaches, yet
Perrin could not forget what they were, what they had done at
Dumai&rsquo;s Wells. But then, he had been there, too. The Light
help him, he had. Pulling his hand from the axe at his belt, he
dismounted.</p>

<p>Servants, men and women from Lord Dobraine&rsquo;s
estates in Cairhien, came running from the lines where the horses
were picketed, to take their mounts. None stood taller than
Perrin&rsquo;s shoulder, country-clad folk, forever bowing and
curtsying obsequiously. Faile said he just upset them when he tried
to make them stop, or at least not to bob around him so often; in
truth, that was how they smelled when he did, and they always went
back to bobbing in an hour or two. Others, nearly as many as the
Two Rivers men, were working with the horses or around the long
rows of high-wheeled carts that hauled all their supplies. A few
were darting in and out of a large red-and-white tent.</p>

<p>As usual, that tent made Perrin grunt gloomily.
Berelain had a larger one back in the Mayener part of the camp,
plus one for her two maids and another for the pair of
thief-catchers she had insisted on bringing. Annoura had a tent of
her own, and Gallenne as well, but only he and Faile possessed one
here. For himself, he would have slept under the sky like the other
men from home. They had nothing over them at night but a blanket.
There was certainly no fear of rain. The Cairhienin servants bedded
down beneath the carts. He could not ask Faile to do that, though,
not when Berelain had a tent. If only he could have left Berelain
in Cairhien. But then he would have had to send Faile into
Bethal.</p>

<p>A pair of banners on tall, fresh-cut poles in the
middle of a clear space near the tent soured his mood further. The
breeze had picked up a trifle, though it was still too warm; he
thought he heard that thunder again, faint in the west. The flags
unfolded in slow waves, collapsed of their own weight, rippled open
again. His crimson-bordered Red Wolfhead and the Red Eagle of
long-dead Manetheren, out in the open again despite his orders.
Perhaps he had stopped trying to hide, after a fashion, but what
was now Ghealdan had been part of Manetheren; Alliandre would not
be soothed by hearing of <em>that</em> banner! He managed a pleasant face
and a smile for the stocky little woman who curtsied deeply and
took Stepper away, but it was a near thing. Lords were supposed to
be obeyed, and if he was supposed to be a lord, well, he seemed to
be making a poor job of it.</p>

<p>Fists on her hips, Maighdin stood studying those
rippling flags as her horse was taken off with the rest.
Surprisingly, Breane had both their bundles, held awkwardly; she
wore a petulant scowl, directed at the other woman. &ldquo;I have heard
about banners like those,&rdquo; Maighdin said suddenly. And angrily;
there was no anger in her voice, and her face was smooth as ice,
but her fury filled Perrin&rsquo;s nose. &ldquo;They were raised by men in
Andor, in the Two Rivers, who rebelled against their lawful ruler.
Aybara is a Two Rivers name, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know much about lawful rulers in the
Two Rivers, Mistress Maighdin,&rdquo; he growled. He was going to skin
whoever had put them up this time. If stories about rebellion had
spread this far&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He faced too many complications already
without adding more. &ldquo;I suppose Morgase was a good queen, but we
had to fend for ourselves, and we did.&rdquo; Abruptly he knew who she
minded him of. Elayne. Not that it meant anything; he had seen men
a thousand miles from the Two Rivers who could have belonged to
families he knew back home. Still, she had to have some reason for
anger. Her accent could be Andoran. &ldquo;Things aren&rsquo;t as bad in
Andor as you might have heard,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;Caemlyn was quiet,
last I was there, and Rand&mdash;the Dragon Reborn&mdash;means to
put Morgase&rsquo;s daughter Elayne on the Lion Throne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Far from being mollified, Maighdin rounded on him,
blue eyes blazing. &ldquo;He intends to <em>put</em> her on the throne?
<em>No</em> man <em>puts</em> a queen on the Lion Throne! Elayne
will claim the throne of Andor by her <em>right</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scratching his head, Perrin wished Faile would stop
watching the woman so calmly and say something. But all she did was
tuck her riding gloves behind her belt. Before he could think of
what to say, Lini darted in, seizing Maighdin&rsquo;s arm and giving
her a shake fit to rattle her teeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You apologize!&rdquo; the old woman barked. &ldquo;This man
saved your life, Maighdin, and you forget yourself, a simple
country woman speaking so to a lord! Remember who you are, and
don&rsquo;t let your tongue land you in hotter water! If this young
lord was at odds with Morgase, well, everyone knows she&rsquo;s
dead, and it&rsquo;s none of your affair in any event! Now apologize
before he grows angry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maighdin stared at Lini, her mouth working, even more
startled than Perrin. Again she surprised him, though. Instead of
erupting at the white-haired woman, she slowly drew herself up,
shoulders squared, and looked him in the eye. &ldquo;Lini is entirely
right. I have no right to speak to you so, Lord Aybara. I
apologize. Humbly. And I ask your pardon.&rdquo; Humble? Her jaw was
stubborn, her tone proud enough for an Aes Sedai, and her scent
said she was ready to chew a hole in something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have it,&rdquo; Perrin said hastily. Which did not
seem to placate her one bit. She smiled, and maybe she intended
gratitude, but he could hear her teeth grinding. Were women all
crazy?</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are hot and dirty, husband,&rdquo; Faile said,
putting a hand in at last, &ldquo;and the last few hours have been trying
for them, I know. Aram can show the men where to clean themselves.
I will take the women with me. I&rsquo;ll have damp cloths brought
to wash your hands and faces,&rdquo; she told Maighdin and Lini.
Gathering up Breane with a gesture, she began herding them toward
the tent. At a nod from Perrin, Aram motioned the men to follow
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As soon as you finish your wash, Master Gill,
I&rsquo;d like to talk with you,&rdquo; Perrin said.</p>

<p>He might as well have made that spinning wheel of
fire. Maighdin whipped around to gape at him, and the other two
women froze in their tracks. Tallanvor was suddenly gripping his
sword hilt again, and Balwer rose on his toes, peering over his
bundle, head tilting this way then that. Not a wolf, perhaps; some
sort of bird, watching for cats. The stout man, Basel Gill, dropped
his belongings and leaped a foot in the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Perrin,&rdquo; he stammered, snatching off the straw
hat. Sweat made tracks in the dust on his cheeks. He bent to pick
up his bundle, changed his mind and straightened again hastily. &ldquo;I
mean, Lord Perrin. I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I thought it was you, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but with them calling you lord, I wasn&rsquo;t sure you&rsquo;d want
to know an old innkeeper.&rdquo; Scrubbing a handkerchief across his
nearly bald head, he laughed nervously. &ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;ll talk
to you. Washing can wait a little longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Perrin,&rdquo; the hulking man said. With his
heavy-lidded eyes, Lamgwin Dorn appeared lazy despite his muscles
and the scars on his face and hands. &ldquo;We heard about young Rand
being the Dragon Reborn, Master Gill and me. Should have figured
you&rsquo;d have come up in the world, too. Perrin Aybara&rsquo;s a
good man, Mistress Maighdin. I think you could trust him with
anything you&rsquo;ve a mind to.&rdquo; He was not lazy, and he was not
stupid, either.</p>

<p>Aram jerked his head impatiently, and Lamgwin and the
other two followed, but Tallanvor and Balwer dragged their feet,
casting wondering glances back at Perrin and Master Gill. Concerned
glances. And at the women. Faile had them moving again, as well,
though with plenty of darted looks at Perrin and Master Gill, at
the men trailing Aram. Suddenly they were not so pleased at being
separated.</p>

<p>Master Gill mopped his forehead and smiled uneasily.
Light, why did he smell afraid? Perrin wondered. Of him? Of a man
tied to the Dragon Reborn, calling himself lord and leading an
army, however small, threatening the Prophet. Might as well throw
gagging Aes Sedai into it, too; he would take the blame for that,
one way or another. <em>No</em>, Perrin thought wryly; <em>nothing
in that to frighten anybody</em>. The whole lot of them were
probably afraid he might murder them all.</p>

<p>Trying to put Master Gill at ease, he led the man to
a large oak a hundred paces from the red-and-white tent. Most of
the great tree&rsquo;s leaves were gone and half those left were
brown, but massive limbs spreading low provided a little shade, and
some of the gnarled roots stood high enough to serve as benches.
Perrin had used one for just that, twiddling his thumbs while camp
was being set. Whenever he tried to do anything useful, there were
always ten hands snatching it away from him.</p>

<p>Basel Gill was not eased, however much Perrin asked
after the Queen&rsquo;s Blessing, his inn in Caemlyn, or recalled
his own visit there. But then, perhaps Gill was remembering that
that visit was not the thing to calm a man, with Aes Sedai and talk
of the Dark One and a flight in the night. He paced anxiously and
hugged his bundle to his chest, shifted it from one arm to the
other and answered in a bare handful of words, licking his lips
between.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Gill,&rdquo; Perrin told him finally, &ldquo;stop calling
me Lord Perrin. I&rsquo;m not. It&rsquo;s complicated, but I&rsquo;m
not a lord. You know that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; the round man replied, at last seating
himself on one of the oak roots. He appeared reluctant to set his
bundled things down, drawing his hands from them slowly. &ldquo;As you
say, Lord Perrin. Ah, Rand&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the Lord Dragon&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;he really
means the Lady Elayne to have the throne? Not that I doubt your
word, of course,&rdquo; he added hurriedly. Pulling off his hat, he began
mopping his forehead again. Even for such a round man, he seemed to
be sweating twice as much as the heat called for. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure
the Lord Dragon will do just as you say.&rdquo; His laugh was shaky. &ldquo;You
wanted to talk to me. And not about my old inn, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin exhaled wearily. He had thought nothing could
be worse than old friends and neighbors bowing and scraping, but at
least they forgot sometimes and spoke their minds. And none of them
was afraid of him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a long way from home,&rdquo; he said in a
gentle voice. No need to go too fast, not with a man ready to jump
out of his skin. &ldquo;I wondered what brought you here. Not troubles of
any kind, I hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You tell him right, Basel Gill,&rdquo; Lini said sharply,
marching up to the oak. &ldquo;No embroidery, mind.&rdquo; She had not been
gone very long, yet somehow she had found time to wash her face and
hands and work her hair into a neat white bun on the back of her
head. And to beat most of the dust from her plain woolen dress.
Bobbing a perfunctory curtsy in Perrin&rsquo;s direction, she turned
to shake a gnarled finger at Gill. &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;Three things annoy to
distraction: a tooth that aches, a shoe that pinches, and a man
that chatters.&rsquo; So you hold to the point and don&rsquo;t go
telling the young lord more than he wants to hear.&rdquo; For a moment
she held the gaping innkeeper with an admonitory stare, then
abruptly gave Perrin another quick curtsy. &ldquo;He does love the sound
of his own voice&mdash;most men do&mdash;but he&rsquo;ll tell it
to you properly, now, my Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master Gill glowered at her, and muttered under his
breath when she waved sharply for him to speak. &ldquo;Bony old&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;
was what Perrin heard. &ldquo;What happened&mdash;the <em>simple</em>
and <em>straight</em> of it&mdash;&rdquo; The round man glared at Lini
again, but she did not appear to notice, &ldquo;was that I had some
business down to Lugard. A chance to import wine. But you&rsquo;re
not interested in that. I took Lamgwin along, of course, and
Breane, because she won&rsquo;t let him out of her sight an hour she
doesn&rsquo;t have to. Along the way, we met Mistress Dorlain,
Mistress Maighdin as we call her, and Lini, and Tallanvor. And
Balwer, of course. On the road. Near to Lugard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maighdin and I were in service in Murandy,&rdquo; Lini put
in impatiently. &ldquo;Until the troubles. Tallanvor was an armsman to
the House, and Balwer the secretary. Bandits burned the manor, and
our lady couldn&rsquo;t afford to keep us, so we decided to travel
together for protection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was telling it, Lini,&rdquo; Master Gill grumbled,
scratching behind his ear. &ldquo;The wine merchant had left Lugard for
the country, for some reason, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He shook his head.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all too much to go into, Perrin. Lord Perrin, I mean.
Forgive me. You know there&rsquo;s trouble everywhere nowadays, one
kind or another. Seems like every time we ran from one kind, we
found another, and always getting further from Caemlyn. Till here
we are, tired and grateful for a rest. And that&rsquo;s the short of
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin nodded slowly. That could be simple truth,
though he had learned that people had a hundred reasons for lying,
or just shading the truth. Grimacing, he raked fingers through his
hair. Light! He was becoming suspicious as a Cairhienin, and the
deeper Rand tangled him, the worse it got. Why on earth would Basel
Gill, of all people, lie to him? A lady&rsquo;s maid, accustomed to
privilege and fallen on hard times; that explained Maighdin. Some
things were simple.</p>

<p>Lini&rsquo;s hands were folded at her waist, but she
watched with a keen eye, no little like a falcon herself, and
Master Gill began fidgeting as soon as he stopped talking. He
seemed to take Perrin&rsquo;s grimace as a demand for more. He
laughed, more on edge than amused. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen so much of
the world since the Aiel War, and I was considerably skinnier,
then. Why, we&rsquo;ve been as far as Amador. Of course, we left
after those Seanchan took the city, but truth, they aren&rsquo;t any
worse than the Whitecloaks, that I could&mdash;&rdquo; He cut off as
Perrin leaned forward abruptly and seized his lapel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seanchan, Master Gill? Are you sure of that? Or is
it one of those rumors, like the Aiel, or Aes Sedai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw them,&rdquo; Gill replied, exchanging uncertain
looks with Lini. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what they call themselves.
I&rsquo;m surprised you don&rsquo;t know. Word&rsquo;s been running
ahead of us all the way from Amador. These Seanchan want people to
know what they&rsquo;re about. Strange people, with strange
creatures.&rdquo; His voice picked up intensity. &ldquo;Like Shadowspawn. Big
leathery things that fly, and carry men, and these things like
lizards, only they&rsquo;re big as horses, and they have three eyes.
I saw them! I did!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; Perrin said, releasing the
man&rsquo;s coat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen them, too.&rdquo; At Falme, where a
thousand Whitecloaks died in minutes and it had taken dead heroes
of legend, called by the Horn of Valere, to throw the Seanchan
back. Rand had said they would return, but how could they have so
soon? Light! If they held Amador, they had to have Tarabon as well,
or most of it. Only a fool killed a deer when he knew there was a
wounded bear behind his back. How much had they taken? &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t send you to Caemlyn right away, Master Gill, but if you
stay with me a while longer, I&rsquo;ll see you there safely.&rdquo; If
staying with him any length of time was safe. The Prophet,
Whitecloaks, and now maybe Seanchan added in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re a good man,&rdquo; Lini said suddenly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we didn&rsquo;t tell you the whole truth, and maybe
we should.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lini, what are you saying?&rdquo; Master Gill exclaimed,
bounding to his feet. &ldquo;I think the heat&rsquo;s getting to her,&rdquo; he
told Perrin. &ldquo;And all the travel. She has strange fancies,
sometimes. You know how old folks can get. Hush, now, Lini!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lini slapped away the hand he was trying to put over
her mouth. &ldquo;You mind yourself, Basel Gill! I&rsquo;ll &lsquo;old&rsquo; you! Maighdin <em>was</em> running from Tallanvor, in a
manner of speaking, and he was chasing her. We all were, four days
now, and near killing us and the horses both. Well, it&rsquo;s no
wonder she doesn&rsquo;t know her own mind half the time; you men
snarl up a woman&rsquo;s wits so she can hardly think, then you
pretend you&rsquo;ve done nothing at all. The lot of you ought to
have your ears boxed on general principle. The girl&rsquo;s afraid
of her own heart! Those two should be married, and the quicker the
better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master Gill gaped at her, and Perrin was not sure his
own mouth might not be hanging open. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not certain I
understand what it is you want of me,&rdquo; he said slowly, and the
white-haired woman leaped in before he was well finished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pretend to be dense. I won&rsquo;t believe
it in you for a moment. I can see you have more wits than most men.
That&rsquo;s the worst habit you men have, making believe you
don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s plain under your noses.&rdquo; What had
happened to all those curtsies? Folding thin arms across her chest,
she eyed him sternly. &ldquo;Well, if you must pretend, I&rsquo;ll set it
out for you. This Lord Dragon of yours does whatever he wants, the
way I hear. Your Prophet picks out people and marries them on the
spot. Very well; you snatch up Maighdin and Tallanvor and marry
them. He&rsquo;ll thank you, and so will she. When her mind
settles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stunned, Perrin glanced at Master Gill, who shrugged
and made a sickly grin. &ldquo;If you will forgive me,&rdquo; Perrin told the
frowning woman, &ldquo;I have some matters I must see to.&rdquo; He hurried
away, only looking back once. Lini was shaking a finger at Master
Gill, berating him despite his protests. The breeze was wrong for
Perrin to hear what they were saying. In truth, he did not want to.
They <em>were</em> all crazy!</p>

<p>Berelain might have her two maids and her
thief-catchers, but Faile had her own attendants, of a sort. Close
on twenty young Tairens and Cairhienin were sitting cross-legged
near the tent, the women in coats and breeches with swords belted
on just like the men. None wore their hair longer than the
shoulder, and men and women both had it tied back with a ribbon,
imitating the Aiel tail. Perrin wondered where the rest were; they
seldom strayed far from the sound of Faile&rsquo;s voice. Not
causing trouble, he hoped. She had taken them under her wing to
keep them <em>out</em> of trouble, she said, and the Light knew
they would have gotten into it, left back in Cairhien with a great
lot of young fools just like them. In Perrin&rsquo;s opinion, the
whole lashing of them needed a swift kick in the bottom to knock
some sense into them. Dueling, playing at <em>
ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>, pretending to be some sort of Aiel.
Idiocy!</p>

<p>Lacile rose to her feet as Perrin came closer, a pale
little woman with red ribbons pinned to her lapels, small gold
hoops in her ears, and a challenging stare that sometimes made the
Two Rivers men think she might like a kiss despite her sword. Right
then, the challenge was stony hard. A moment behind her, Arrela
stood too, tall and dark, with her hair cut short as a
Maiden&rsquo;s and her clothes plainer than most of the men&rsquo;s.
Unlike Lacile, Arrela made it clear she would as soon kiss a dog as
any man. The pair made as if to move in front of the tent, to block
Perrin&rsquo;s way, but a square-chinned fellow in a puffy-sleeved
coat barked an order and they sat again. Reluctantly. For that
matter, Parelean thumbed that block of a chin as though he might be
reconsidering. He had worn a beard the first time Perrin saw him&mdash;several of the Tairen men had had them&mdash;but Aiel did
not wear beards.</p>

<p>Perrin muttered about foolishness under his breath.
They were Faile&rsquo;s to the bone, and the fact that he was her
husband meant little. Aram might be jealous of his attentions, yet
Aram at least shared his affections with Faile. He could feel the
young idiots&rsquo; eyes on him as he strode inside. Faile would
skin him if she ever learned that he hoped they would keep <em>
her</em> from trouble.</p>

<p>The tent was tall and spacious, with a flowered
carpet for a floor and sparse furnishings that folded for storage
on a cart, most of them. The heavy stand-mirror certainly could
not. Except for brass-bound chests draped with embroidered cloths
and doubling as extra tables, straight lines of bright gilt
decorated everything down to the washstand and its mirror. A dozen
mirrored lamps made the interior nearly as bright as outside, if
considerably cooler, and there were even a pair of silk hangings
dangling from the roof poles, too ornate for Perrin&rsquo;s taste.
Too rigid, with the birds and flowers marching in lines and angles.
Dobraine had set them up to travel like Cairhienin nobles, though
Perrin had managed to &ldquo;lose&rdquo; the worst of it. The huge bed, for
one, a ridiculous thing to travel with. It had taken up almost a
whole cart to itself.</p>

<p>Faile and Maighdin were sitting alone together,
worked silver cups in hand. They had the air of women feeling one
another out, all smiles on the outside yet with a hint of sharpness
to the eyes, a hint of listening for something behind the words,
and not a clue as to whether they would hug in the next instant or
draw knives. Well, he thought most women would not actually go as
far as knives, but Faile could. Maighdin appeared much less
travel-worn than she had, washed and combed, the dust brushed from
her dress. A small mosaic-topped table between them held more cups
and a tall sweating silver pitcher that gave off the minty scent of
herb tea. Both women looked around at his entrance, and for an
instant, they had almost exactly the same expression, coolly
wondering who was barging in and not at all pleased with the
interruption. At least Faile softened hers immediately with a
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Gill told me your story, Mistress Dorlain,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve faced hard days, but you can be sure
you&rsquo;re safe here till you decide to leave.&rdquo; The woman murmured
thanks over the rim of her cup, but she smelled wary, and her eyes
tried to read him like a book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maighdin also told me their story, Perrin,&rdquo; Faile
said, &ldquo;and I have an offer to make her. Maighdin, you and your
friends have had trying months behind, and you tell me of no
prospects ahead. Enter my service, all of you. You will still have
to journey, but the circumstances will be much better. I pay well,
and I am not a harsh mistress.&rdquo; Perrin voiced his approval
immediately. If Faile wanted to indulge her fancy for taking in
strays, at least he wanted to help this lot, too. Maybe they would
be safer with him than wandering around alone at that.</p>

<p>Choking on her tea, Maighdin nearly dropped her cup.
She blinked at Faile, dabbing at the damp on her chin with a
lace-edged linen handkerchief, and her chair creaked faintly as she
turned, strangely, to study Perrin. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;thank you,&rdquo; she said
at last, slowly. &ldquo;I think&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Another moment&rsquo;s perusal of
Perrin, and her voice picked up. &ldquo;Yes, I thank you, and I accept
your kind offer gratefully. I must tell my companions.&rdquo; Rising, she
hesitated in setting her cup on the tray, then straightened only to
spread her skirts in a curtsy suitable for any palace. &ldquo;I will try
to give good service, my Lady,&rdquo; she said levelly. &ldquo;May I withdraw?&rdquo;
At Faile&rsquo;s assent, she curtsied again and backed away two
steps before turning to go! Perrin scratched his beard. Somebody
else who would be bobbing at him every time she turned around.</p>

<p>No sooner had the tentflap dropped behind Maighdin
than Faile put her cup down and laughed, drumming her heels on the
carpet. &ldquo;Oh, I like her, Perrin. She has spirit! I&rsquo;ll wager
she would have singed your beard over those banners if I
hadn&rsquo;t saved you. Oh, yes. Spirit!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin grunted. Just what he needed; another woman to
singe his beard. &ldquo;I promised Master Gill to look after them, Faile,
but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Can you guess what that Lini asked? She wanted me to
marry Maighdin to that fellow Tallanvor. Just stand them up and
marry them whatever they said! She claimed they want it.&rdquo; He filled
a silver cup with tea and dropped into the chair Maighdin had
vacated, ignoring its alarming groans under his sudden weight. &ldquo;In
any case, that nonsense is the least of my worries. Master Gill
says it was the Seanchan took Amador, and I believe him. Light! The
Seanchan!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faile tapped her fingertips together, staring across
them at nothing. &ldquo;That might be just the thing,&rdquo; she mused. &ldquo;Most
servants do better married than not. Perhaps I should arrange it.
And for Breane, too. The way she went running out of here to check
on that big fellow as soon as her face was clean, I suspect they
should be already. There was a gleam in her eye. I won&rsquo;t have
that kind of behavior in my servants, Perrin. It just leads to
tears and recriminations and sulking. And Breane will be worse than
he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin stared at her. &ldquo;Did you hear me?&rdquo; he said
slowly. &ldquo;The Seanchan have captured Amador! The Seanchan,
Faile!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave a start&mdash;she really had been thinking
about marrying off those women!&mdash;then smiled at him, amused.
&ldquo;Amador is long way, yet, and if we do meet with these Seanchan,
I&rsquo;m sure you will deal with them. After all, you taught me to
perch on your wrist, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; That was what she claimed,
though he had never seen any sign of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They might be a touch more difficult than you were,&rdquo;
he said dryly, and she smiled again. She smelled extremely pleased,
for some reason. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking about sending Grady or Neald to
warn Rand, no matter what he said.&rdquo; She shook her head fiercely,
smiles evaporating, but he pushed on. &ldquo;If I knew how to find him, I
would. There has to be some way to get word to him without anyone
learning of it.&rdquo; Rand had insisted on that more than he had on
secrecy about Masema. Perrin had been exiled from Rand&rsquo;s
presence, and no one was to know anything remained between them
except enmity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He knows, Perrin. I&rsquo;m sure of it. Maighdin saw
pigeoncotes everywhere in Amador, and apparently the Seanchan
didn&rsquo;t look at them twice. By this time, any merchant who has
business with Amador has heard, and so has the White Tower. Believe
me, Rand must have, too. You have to trust that he knows best. In
this, he does.&rdquo; She was not always so certain of that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Perrin muttered irritably. He tried not to
worry about Rand&rsquo;s sanity, but Rand made Perrin at his most
suspicious look like a child skipping in a meadow. How much did
Rand trust even him? Rand kept things back, had plans he never let
on.</p>

<p>Exhaling, Perrin settled back in the chair, gulped a
swallow of tea. The truth of it was, mad or sane, Rand was right.
If the Forsaken caught a suspicion of what he was up to, or the
White Tower did, they would find some way to overturn the anvil on
his feet. &ldquo;At least I can give the Tower&rsquo;s eyes-and-ears less
to talk about. This time, I&rsquo;m <em>burning</em> that bloody
banner.&rdquo; And the Wolfhead, too. He might have to play at being a
lord, but he could do it without a bloody flag!</p>

<p>Faile&rsquo;s full lips pursed judiciously, and she
shook her head slightly. Slipping from her chair, she knelt beside
him, took his wrist in her hands. Perrin met her level gaze warily.
When she looked at him so intently, so seriously, she was about to
tell him something important. That, or pull the wool over his eyes
and spin him around till he did not know front from back. Her scent
told him nothing. He tried to stop smelling her; it was all too
easy to lose himself in that, and then she <em>would</em> pull the
wool over his eyes. One thing he had learned since marrying: a man
needed all of his wits dealing with a woman. Too often even that
was not enough; women did what they wanted as surely as Aes
Sedai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might want to reconsider, husband,&rdquo; she
murmured. A tiny smile quirked her mouth as if she once again knew
what he was thinking. &ldquo;I doubt anyone who&rsquo;s seen us since we
entered Ghealdan knew what the Red Eagle is. Around a town the size
of Bethal, some will, though. And the longer we have to hunt for
Masema, the greater the chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not bother with saying that was all the more
reason to get rid of the banner. Faile was no fool, and she thought
much faster than he. &ldquo;Then why keep it,&rdquo; he asked slowly, &ldquo;when all
it&rsquo;ll do is draw eyes to the idiot everybody will think is
trying to pull Manetheren out of the grave?&rdquo; Men had tried that in
the past, and women, too; the name of Manetheren carried powerful
memories, and it was convenient for anyone who wanted to start a
rebellion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because it <em>will</em> draw eyes.&rdquo; She leaned
toward him intently. &ldquo;To a man trying to raise up Manetheren again.
Lesser folk will smile to your face, hope you ride on soon, and try
to forget you as soon as you do. As for the greater, they&rsquo;ve
too much in front of their faces right now to look twice unless you
pinch their noses. Compared to the Seanchan, or the Prophet, or the
Whitecloaks, a man trying to raise Manetheren is small turnips. And
I think it&rsquo;s safe to say the Tower won&rsquo;t look twice
either, not now.&rdquo; Her smile widened, and the light in her eyes said
she was about to make her most telling point. &ldquo;But most important,
no one will think that man is doing anything else.&rdquo; Abruptly her
smile vanished; she stuck a finger against his nose, hard. &ldquo;And
don&rsquo;t call yourself an idiot, Perrin t&rsquo;Bashere Aybara.
Not even sideways, like that. You aren&rsquo;t, and I do not like
it.&rdquo; Her scent was tiny spikes, not true anger but definitely
displeased.</p>

<p>Quicksilver. A kingfisher flashing by faster than
thought. Certainly faster than his thoughts. It would never have
occurred to him to hide so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;flagrantly. But he could see the
sense. It was like concealing the fact that you were a murderer by
claiming to be a thief. Yet it might work.</p>

<p>Chuckling, he kissed her fingertip. &ldquo;The banner
stays,&rdquo; he said. He supposed that meant the Wolfhead did, too.
Blood and bloody ashes! &ldquo;Alliandre has to know the truth, though.
If she thinks Rand means to set me up as King of Manetheren and
take her lands&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faile rose so suddenly, turning away, that he was
afraid he had made a mistake bringing up the Queen. Alliandre could
lead to Berelain all too easily, and Faile smelled&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;prickly.
Wary. But what she said, over her shoulder, was &ldquo;Alliandre
won&rsquo;t be a bit of trouble for Perrin Goldeneyes. That
bird&rsquo;s as good as netted, husband, so it&rsquo;s time to put
our minds on how to find Masema.&rdquo; Kneeling gracefully beside a
small chest against the tent wall, the only chest without
draperies, she lifted the lid and began removing rolled maps.</p>

<p>Perrin hoped she was right about Alliandre, because
he did not know what to do if she was wrong. If only he were half
what she thought him. Alliandre was a netted bird, the Seanchan
would fall over like dolls for Perrin Goldeneyes, and he would
snatch up the Prophet and take him to Rand if Masema had ten
thousand men around him. Not for the first time he realized that
however much her anger hurt and confused him, it was her
disappointment he feared. If he ever saw that in her eyes, it would
rip the heart out of his chest.</p>

<p>He knelt beside her and helped her spread out the
largest map, covering the south of Ghealdan and the north of
Amadicia, and studied it as though Masema&rsquo;s name would leap
off the parchment at him. He had more reason than Rand to want to
succeed. Whatever else, he could not fail Faile.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Faile lay in the darkness, listening until she was
sure that Perrin&rsquo;s breath had the deep rhythm of sleep, then
slipped out from the blankets they shared. Rueful amusement touched
her as she pulled her linen nightdress up over her head. Did he
really think she would not find out that he had hidden the bed deep
in a copse one morning while the carts were being loaded? Not that
she minded; not a great deal, at least. She was sure she had slept
on the ground as often as he. She had pretended surprise, of
course, and made light of it. Anything else, and he would have
apologized, perhaps even gone back to fetch the bed. Managing a
husband was an art, so her mother said. Had Deira ni Ghaline ever
found it so difficult?</p>

<p>Scuffing her bare feet into slippers, she shrugged
into a silk robe, then hesitated, looking down at Perrin. He would
be able to see her clearly, if he woke, but to her, he was just a
shadowed mound. She wished her mother were there, now, to advise
her. She loved Perrin with every fiber of her being, and he
confused every fiber. Actually understanding men was impossible, of
course, but he was so unlike anyone she had grown up with. He never
swaggered, and instead of laughing at himself, he was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;modest.
She had not believed a man <em>could</em> be modest! He insisted
that only chance had made him a leader, claimed he did not know how
to lead, when men who met him were ready to follow after an hour.
He dismissed his own thinking as slow, when those slow, considering
thoughts saw so deeply that she had to dance a merry jig to keep
any secrets at all. He was a wonderful man, her curly-haired wolf.
So strong. And so gentle. Sighing, she tiptoed from the tent. His
ears had caused her difficulties before.</p>

<p>The camp lay quiet beneath a gibbous moon that gave
as much light in a cloudless sky as it normally would have full, a
brightness that washed out the stars. Some sort of night-bird cried
shrilly, then fell silent at an owl&rsquo;s deep hoot. There was a
small breeze, and for a wonder, it actually seemed a little cool.
Probably her imagination. The nights were cool only in comparison
to the days.</p>

<p>Most of the men were asleep, dark humps among the
shadows beneath the trees. A few remained awake, talking around the
handful of fires still burning. She made no effort to hide, but
none noticed her. Some appeared half asleep where they sat, heads
nodding. If she had not known how well the men on sentry duty would
be keeping watch, she might have thought the camp could be
surprised by a herd of wild cattle. Of course, the Maidens would be
on guard in the night, too. But it did not matter if they saw her,
either.</p>

<p>The high-wheeled carts made long, shadowed rows, the
servants already snug and snoring beneath. Most of the servants.
One fire still crackled there. Maighdin and her friends sat around
it. Tallanvor was talking, gesturing fiercely, but only the other
men seemed to be paying him any mind, though he appeared to be
addressing himself to Maighdin. That they had had better garb in
their bundles than those near rags was not surprising, but their
former mistress must have had a very free hand to give out silk to
her people, and Maighdin wore finely cut silk indeed, in a muted
blue. None of the others was dressed so well, so perhaps Maighdin
had been their lady&rsquo;s favorite.</p>

<p>A twig snapped under Faile&rsquo;s foot, and heads
whipped around, Tallanvor starting to his feet, half drawing his
sword before he saw her gathering her robe in the moonlight. They
were more alert than the Two Rivers men behind her. For an instant
the lot of them just stared at her; then Maighdin rose gracefully
and made a deep curtsy, and the others hastily followed her example
with varying degrees of skill. Only Maighdin and Balwer appeared at
all at ease. A nervous smile split Gill&rsquo;s round face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on with what you were doing,&rdquo; Faile told them
kindly. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t stay up too late; tomorrow will be full.&rdquo;
She walked on, but when she glanced back, they were still standing,
still peering after her. Their travels must have made them wary as
rabbits, always watching for a fox. She wondered how well they
would fit in. Over the next few weeks, she would be busy training
them to her ways, learning theirs. One was as important as the
other for a well-run household. The time would have to be
found.</p>

<p>They did not stay long in her thoughts tonight. Soon
she was beyond the carts, not quite out to where Two Rivers men
would be keeping sharp watch from up in the trees. Nothing larger
than a mouse would get by them unseen&mdash;even some of the
Maidens had been spotted upon occasion&mdash;but they were
watching for anyone attempting to sneak in. Not for those who had a
right to be there. In a small moonlit clearing, her people were
waiting.</p>

<p>Some of the men bowed, and Parelean nearly went to
one knee before stopping himself. Several women instinctively made
curtsies that looked quite peculiar in men&rsquo;s garb, then
dropped their eyes or shifted in embarrassment at realizing what
they had done. The manners of the court had been bred into them,
though they tried very hard to adopt Aiel customs. What they
believed were Aiel customs, at least. Sometimes they horrified the
Maidens with what they believed. Perrin called them fools, and they
were in some ways, but they had sworn fealty to her, these
Cairhienin and Tairens&mdash;water oath, they named it, copying
the Aiel, trying to&mdash;and that made them hers. Among
themselves they had taken to calling their &ldquo;society&rdquo; <em>Cha
Faile</em>, the Falcon&rsquo;s Talon, though they had seen the
necessity of keeping that quiet. They were not fools in all ways.
In fact, around the edges anyway, they were not too unlike the
young men and women she had grown up with.</p>

<p>Those she had sent off early that morning had just
returned, for the women among them were still changing out of the
dresses they had worn of necessity. Even one woman dressed as a man
would have roused notice in Bethal, not to mention five. The
clearing was a great flurry of skirts and shifts, coats and shirts
and breeches. The women made believe they did not mind being
unclothed in front of others, including men, since the Aiel
apparently did not, but haste and labored breathing gave them the
lie. The men were all shifting feet and turning heads, torn between
looking away decently and watching, as they thought the Aiel did,
while pretending they were not looking at half-dressed women. Faile
held her robe close over her nightdress; she could not have dressed
further without waking Perrin for sure, but she made no pretense at
comfort. She was no Domani, to receive her retainers in her
bath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive us for being late, my Lady Faile,&rdquo; Selande
panted, tugging her coat on. The accents of Cairhien were sharp in
the short woman&rsquo;s voice. Even for a Cairhienin, she was not
tall. She managed a credible swagger, though, a suitable boldness
in the tilt of her head and the set of her shoulders. &ldquo;We would
have returned sooner, but the gate guards made a bother letting us
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A bother?&rdquo; Faile said sharply. If only she could
have seen with her own eyes, on top of theirs; if only Perrin had
let her go instead of that trollop. No, she would not think about
Berelain. It was not Perrin&rsquo;s fault. She repeated that to
herself twenty times a day, like a prayer. But why was the man so
blind? &ldquo;What kind of bother?&rdquo; She drew a chagrined breath. Troubles
with your husband should never affect your tone with your
vassals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing of note, my Lady.&rdquo; Selande buckled her sword
belt and settled it on her hips. &ldquo;They let some fellows ahead of us
drive their wagons through without a second look, but they were
worried about letting women go out into the night.&rdquo; Some of the
other women laughed. The five men who had gone into Bethal stirred
irritably, no doubt because they had not been thought enough
protection. The rest of <em>Cha Faile</em> made a thick semicircle
behind those ten, watching Faile closely, listening closely.
Moonlight shadowed their faces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me what you saw,&rdquo; Faile commanded in a calmer
tone. Much better.</p>

<p>Selande made her report concisely, and for all
Faile&rsquo;s wishes that she had gone herself, she had to admit
they had seen almost as much as she could have wished. The streets
of Bethal were nearly empty even at the busiest hours of the day.
People stayed to their own homes as much as possible. A little
commerce trickled in and out, but few merchants ventured into this
part of Ghealdan, and barely enough food came in from the
countryside to keep everyone fed. Most of the townspeople seemed
stunned, afraid of what lay outside the walls, sinking deeper and
deeper into apathy and despair. Everyone kept their mouths closed
for fear of the Prophet&rsquo;s spies, and their eyes as well, for
fear of being taken for spies. The Prophet had a deep effect. For
instance, however many bandits roamed the hills, cutpurses and
footpads had vanished from Bethal. It was said the Prophet&rsquo;s
penalty for a thief was to cut off the man&rsquo;s hands. Though
that did not seem to apply to his own people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Queen tours the city every day, showing herself
to keep spirits up,&rdquo; Selande said, &ldquo;but I do hot think it helps
much. She is making a progress here in the south to remind people
they have a Queen; maybe she has had more success elsewhere. The
Watch has been added to the wall guards, and all but a handful of
her soldiers, too. Perhaps it makes the townsfolk feel safer. Until
she moves on. Unlike everyone else, Alliandre herself apparently
feels no fear the Prophet will come storming over the walls. She
walks alone in the gardens of Lord Telabin&rsquo;s palace, morning
and evening, and keeps only a few soldiers, who spend most of their
time in the kitchens. Everybody in the city seems as concerned with
food, with how long there will be enough, as they are with the
Prophet. In truth, my Lady, for all the guards on the walls, I
think if Masema appeared at the gates alone, they might give him
the town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They would,&rdquo; Meralda put in contemptuously, buckling
her own sword round her waist, &ldquo;and beg for mercy.&rdquo; Dark and
stocky, Meralda was as tall as Faile, but the Tairen woman ducked
her head at a frown from Selande and murmured an apology. There
were no doubts who led <em>Cha Faile</em>, after Faile herself.</p>

<p>She had been pleased there was no need to change the
precedence they had established. Selande was the brightest of them
except perhaps for Parelean, and only Arella and Camaille were
quicker. And Selande had something extra, a steadiness, as if she
had already faced the worst fear in her life and nothing could ever
be that bad again. Of course, she wanted a scar like those some of
the Maidens had. Faile possessed several small scars, badges of
honor most of them, but actually seeking one was idiocy. At least
the woman was not too very eager in the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We made a map, as you required, my Lady,&rdquo; the
diminutive woman finished with a last, warning glance at Meralda.
&ldquo;We marked out Lord Telabin&rsquo;s palace on the back as much as we
could, but I fear that is not much more than the gardens and
stables.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faile did not try to make out the lines on the paper
she unfolded in the moonlight. A pity she had not been able to go
herself; she could have mapped the interior, too. No. Done was
done, as Perrin liked to say. And it was enough. &ldquo;You are certain
no one searches wagons leaving the city?&rdquo; Even in the pale light,
she could see confusion on many of the faces in front of her. None
knew why she had sent some of them into Bethal.</p>

<p>Selande did not look confused. &ldquo;Yes, my Lady,&rdquo; she
said calmly. Quite bright, and more than quick enough.</p>

<p>The wind gusted for a moment, rustling leaves on the
trees, rustling dead leaves on the ground, and Faile wished she had
Perrin&rsquo;s ears. His nose and eyes, too. It did not matter if
anyone saw her here with her retainers, but eavesdroppers would be
something else. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done very well, Selande. All of you
have.&rdquo; Perrin knew the dangers here, as real as any farther south;
he knew, but like most men, he thought with his heart as often as
his head. A wife had to be practical, to keep her husband out of
trouble. That had been her mother&rsquo;s very first piece of advice
on married life. &ldquo;At first light, you will return to Bethal, and if
you receive word from me, this is what you will do&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even Selande&rsquo;s eyes widened in shock as she went
on, but no one murmured the slightest protest. Faile would have
been surprised if anyone had. Her instructions were to the point.
There would be some danger, but under the circumstances, not nearly
what might have been.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are there any questions?&rdquo; she said finally. &ldquo;Does
everyone understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>With one voice, <em>Cha Faile</em> answered. &ldquo;We live
to serve our Lady Faile.&rdquo; And that meant they would serve her
beloved wolf, whether he wanted them to or not.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Maighdin shifted in her blankets on the hard ground,
sleep eluding her. That was her name, now; a new name for a new
life. Maighdin, for her mother, and Dorlain, for a family on an
estate that had been hers. A new life for an old life gone, but
ties of the heart could not be cut. And now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A faint crackle of dead leaves brought her head up,
and she watched a dim shape pass through the trees. The Lady Faile,
returning to her tent from wherever she had gone. A pleasant young
woman, kindhearted and well spoken. Whatever her husband&rsquo;s
stock, she almost certainly was nobly born. But young.
Inexperienced. That might be a help.</p>

<p>Maighdin let her head fall back on the cloak she had
wadded up for a pillow. Light, what was she doing here? Taking
service as a lady&rsquo;s maid! No. She would hold on to her
confidence in herself, at least. She could still find that. She
could. If she dug deeply. Her breath caught at the sound of
footsteps close by.</p>

<p>Tallanvor knelt gracefully at her side. He was
shirtless, moonlight gleaming on the smooth muscles of his chest
and shoulders, his face in shadows. A slight breeze ruffled his
hair. &ldquo;What madness is this?&rdquo; he asked softly. &ldquo;Entering service?
What are you up to? And don&rsquo;t tell me that nonsense about
making a new life; I don&rsquo;t believe it. No one does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She tried to turn away, but he laid a hand on her
shoulder. He exerted no pressure, yet it stopped her as surely as a
halter. Light, please let her not tremble. The Light did not
listen, but at least she managed to keep her voice steady. &ldquo;If you
haven&rsquo;t noticed, I must make my way in the world, now. Better
as a lady&rsquo;s maid than a tavern maid. You may feel free to go
on alone if service here doesn&rsquo;t suit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t abdicate your wits or your pride
when you gave up the throne,&rdquo; he muttered. Burn Lini for revealing
that! &ldquo;If you mean to pretend that you did, I suggest you avoid
letting Lini get you alone.&rdquo; The man chuckled at her! He chuckled,
oh, so richly! &ldquo;She wants a word with Maighdin, and I suspect she
won&rsquo;t be as gentle with Maighdin as she was with Morgase.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Angrily she sat up, brushing his hand away. &ldquo;Are you
blind, and deaf as well? The Dragon Reborn has <em>plans</em> for
Elayne! Light, I wouldn&rsquo;t like it if he simply knew her name!
It must be more than chance that brought me to one of his henchmen,
Tallanvor. It has to be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn me, I knew it must be that. I hoped I was
wrong, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He sounded as angry as she. He had no right to
be angry! &ldquo;Elayne is safe in the White Tower, the Amyrlin Seat
won&rsquo;t let her anywhere near a man who can channel, even if he
is the Dragon Reborn&mdash;especially if he is!&mdash;and
Maighdin Dorlain can do nothing about the Amyrlin Seat, the Dragon
Reborn, <em>or</em> the Lion Throne. All she can do is get her neck snapped,
or her throat cut, or&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maighdin Dorlain can watch!&rdquo; she broke in, at least
partly to stop that awful litany. &ldquo;She can listen! She can&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&rdquo;
Irritably, she trailed off. What <em>could</em> she do? Suddenly
she realized she was sitting there in a thin shift and hurriedly
folded her blankets around her. The night actually seemed a little
cool. Or maybe the goose bumps on her skin were from
Tallanvor&rsquo;s unseen eyes on her. The thought roused a flush in
her cheeks she hoped he could not see. Luckily, it put a heat in
her voice, too. She was not a girl, to go blushing because a man
looked at her! &ldquo;I will do what I can, whatever that is. The chance
will come to learn something or do something that will help Elayne,
and I will take it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A dangerous decision,&rdquo; he told her calmly. She
wished she could make out his face in the darkness. Only to read
his expression, of course. &ldquo;You heard him threaten to hang anyone
who looked at him the wrong way. I can believe it, in a man with
those eyes. Like a beast. I was surprised he let that fellow go; I
thought he&rsquo;d rip his throat out! If he discovers who you are,
who you used to be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Balwer might betray you. He never really
explained why he helped us escape Amador. Maybe he thought Queen
Morgase would give him a new position. Now he knows there&rsquo;s no
chance of that, and he might want to curry favor with his new
master and mistress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you afraid of <em>Lord</em> Perrin Goldeneyes?&rdquo;
she demanded contemptuously. Light, the man frightened her! Those
eyes belonged on a wolf. &ldquo;Balwer knows enough to hold his tongue.
Anything he says will reflect on him; he came with me, after all.
If you&rsquo;re afraid, then ride on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You always fling that in my face,&rdquo; he sighed,
settling back on his heels. She could not see his eyes, but she
could feel them. &ldquo;Ride on if you wish, you say. Once, there was a
soldier loved a queen from afar, knowing it was hopeless, knowing
he could never dare speak. Now the queen is gone, and only a woman
remains, and I hope. I burn with hope! If you want me to leave,
Maighdin, say it. One word. &lsquo;Go!&rsquo; A simple word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She opened her mouth. <em>A simple word</em>, she
thought. <em>Light, it&rsquo;s only one word! Why can&rsquo;t I say
it! Light, please!</em> For the second time that night, the Light
failed to hear. She sat there huddled in her blankets like a fool,
her mouth open, her face growing hotter and hotter.</p>

<p>If he had chuckled again, she would have put her belt
knife in him. If he had laughed, or given any sign of triumph&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Instead, he leaned forward and gently kissed her eyes. She made a
sound deep in her throat; she could not seem to move. Wide-eyed,
she watched him stand. He loomed in the moonlight. She was a queen&mdash;she had been a queen&mdash;used to command, used to hard
decisions in hard times, but right then the pounding of her heart
drummed thought from her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had you said &lsquo;go,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; he told her, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
have buried hope, but I could never leave you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not until he was back in his own blankets could she
make herself lie down and draw hers around her. She breathed as if
she had been running. The night was cool; she was shivering, not
trembling. Tallanvor was too young. Too young! Worse, he was right.
Burn him for that! A lady&rsquo;s maid could do nothing to affect
events, and if the Dragon Reborn&rsquo;s wolf-eyed killer learned
that he had Morgase of Andor in his hands, she could be used
against Elayne instead of helping her. He had no right to be right
when she wanted him to be wrong! The illogic of that thought
infuriated her. There <em>was</em> a chance she might do some good!
There had to be!</p>

<p>In the back of her head, a small voice laughed. <em>
You can&rsquo;t forget that you&rsquo;re Morgase Trakand</em>, it
told her scornfully, <em>and even after she&rsquo;s abdicated her
throne, Queen Morgase can&rsquo;t stop trying her hand in the
affairs of the mighty, no matter how much ruin she&rsquo;s made of
it so far. And she can&rsquo;t tell a man to go away, either,
because she can&rsquo;t stop thinking how strong his hands are, and
how his lips curve when he smiles, and</em>&mdash;</p>

<p>Furious, she pulled the blanket over her head, trying
to shut out the voice. She was <em>not</em> staying because she
could not walk away from power. As for Tallanvor&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She would
set him firmly in his place. This time she would! But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;What
was his place, with a woman who was no longer a queen? She tried to
put him out of her mind and tried to ignore that mocking voice that
would not be quiet, yet when sleep finally came, she could still
feel the pressure of his lips on her eyelids.</p>
