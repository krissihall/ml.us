<h4><em>Message from the M&rsquo;Hael</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">A</span>
 mile west of the ridge, the camps began, men and
horses and cook fires, wind-flailed banners and a few scattered
tents clumped by nationality, by House, each camp a lake of churned
mud separated from the others by stretches of brushy heath. Men
mounted and afoot watched Rand&rsquo;s streaming banners pass, and
peered toward other camps to gauge reactions. When the Aiel had
been present, these men had made a single huge camp, driven
together by one of the few things they truly shared in common. They
were not Aiel, and feared them however much they denied it. The
world would die unless he succeeded, but he had no illusions that
they shared any loyalty to him, or even believed that the fate of
the world could not be made to accommodate their own concerns,
their own desires for gold or glory or power. A handful did,
perhaps, a bare handful, but for the most part, they followed
because they feared him far more than they did the Aiel. Maybe more
than they did the Dark One, in whom some did not really believe,
not in the depths of their hearts, not that he could and would
touch the world harder than he had already. Rand stood before their
faces, and they believed in that. He accepted it, now. He had too
many battles ahead of him to waste effort on one he could not win.
So long as they followed and obeyed, it had to be enough.</p>

<p>The largest of the camps was his own, and here
Illianer Companions in green coats with yellow cuffs rubbed
shoulders with Tairen Defenders of the Stone in fat-sleeved coats
striped black-and-gold and an equal number of Cairhienin drawn from
forty-odd Houses, in dark colors, some with <em>con</em> stiff
above their heads. They cooked at different fires, slept apart,
picketed their horses apart, and eyed one another warily, but they
mingled. The safety of the Dragon Reborn was their responsibility,
and they took the job seriously. Any of them might betray him, but
not while the others were there to watch. Old hatreds and new
dislikes would bring betrayal of any plot before the betrayer
stopped to think.</p>

<p>A ring of steel stood guard around Rand&rsquo;s tent,
a huge peaked thing of green silk embroidered all over with bees in
thread-of-gold. It had belonged to his predecessor, Mattin
Stepaneos, and had come with the crown, in a manner of speaking.
Companions in burnished conical helmets stood side by side with
Defenders in helmets ridged and rimmed, and Cairhienin in
bell-shaped helms, ignoring the wind, barred faceguards hiding
their features, halberds slanted precisely. Not one moved a hair
when Rand drew rein, but a bevy of servants came running to attend
to him and the Asha&rsquo;man. A bony woman in the green-and-yellow
vest of a groom from the Royal Palace in Illian took his bridle,
while his stirrup was held by a bulbous-nosed fellow in the
black-and-gold livery of the Stone of Tear. They tugged forelocks
to him, and cast only one sharp look at one another. Boreane
Carivin, a stout pale little woman in a dark dress,
self-importantly offered him a silver tray of damp cloths from
which steam rose. Cairhienin, she watched the other two, though
more as if making sure they did their tasks properly than with the
animosity for each other they barely hid. But with care, still.
What worked with the soldiers worked with the servants as well.</p>

<p>Drawing off his gauntlets, Rand waved away
Boreane&rsquo;s tray. Damer Flinn had risen from an ornately carved
bench in front of the tent as Rand dismounted. Bald except for a
ragged white fringe, Flinn looked more a grandfather than an
Asha&rsquo;man. A leather-tough grandfather with a stiff leg, who
had seen more of the world than a farm. The sword at his hip looked
as if it belonged, as well it should on a former soldier of the
Queen&rsquo;s Guard. Rand trusted him more than most. Flinn had
saved his life, after all.</p>

<p>Flinn saluted, fist to chest, and when Rand
acknowledged him with a nod, limped closer and waited until the
grooms left with the horses before speaking in a low voice.
&ldquo;Torval&rsquo;s here. Sent by the M&rsquo;Hael, he says. He wanted to
wait in the council tent. I told Narishma to watch him.&rdquo; That had
been Rand&rsquo;s command, though he was not sure why he had given
it; no one who came from the Black Tower was to be left alone.
Hesitating, Flinn fingered the Dragon on his black collar. &ldquo;He
wasn&rsquo;t happy to hear you&rsquo;d raised all of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t he, now,&rdquo; Rand said softly, tucking his
gloves behind his sword belt. And because Flinn still looked
uncertain, he added, &ldquo;You all earned it.&rdquo; He had been about to send
one of the Asha&rsquo;man to Taim&mdash;the Leader, the
M&rsquo;Hael, as the Asha&rsquo;man all called him&mdash;but now
Torval could carry the message. In the council tent? &ldquo;Have
refreshments sent,&rdquo; he told Flinn, then motioned Hopwil and Dashiva
to follow.</p>

<p>Flinn saluted again, but Rand was already striding
away, black mud squelching around his boots. No cheers rose for him
in the blustering wind. He could recall when there had been. If
that was not one of Lews Therin&rsquo;s memories. If Lews Therin had
ever been real. A flash of color just beyond the edge of sight, the
feel of someone about to touch him from behind. With an effort, he
focused himself.</p>

<p>The council tent was a large red-striped pavilion
that had once sat on the Plains of Maredo, now pitched in the
middle of Rand&rsquo;s encampment, surrounded by thirty paces of
bare ground. There were never guards here, not unless Rand was
meeting with the nobles. Anyone trying to slip in would have been
seen instantly by a thousand prying eyes. Three banners on tall
poles formed a triangle around the tent, the Rising Sun of
Cairhien, the Three Crescents of Tear, and the Golden Bees of
Illian, and above the crimson roof, higher than the rest, stood the
Dragon Banner, and the Banner of Light. The wind made them all
stand out, rippling and snapping, and the tent walls shivered in
the gusts. Inside, colorful, fringed carpets made a floor, and the
only furniture was a huge table, thickly carved and gilded, inlaid
with ivory and turquoise. A jumble of maps almost hid the
tabletop.</p>

<p>Torval lifted his head from the maps, plainly ready
to give the rough side of his tongue to whoever had barged in on
him. Close to his middle years and tall beside anyone save Rand or
an Aiel, he stared coldly down a sharp nose that practically
quivered with indignation. The Dragon and the Sword glistened on
his coat collar in the light of the stand-lamps. A silk coat,
shining black, cut fine enough for a lord. His sword had silver
mountings washed with gold, and a glittering red gem capped the
hilt. Another gleamed darkly on a finger ring. You could not train
men to be weapons without expecting a certain amount of arrogance,
yet Rand did not like Torval. But then, he had no need of Lews
Therin&rsquo;s voice to be suspicious of any man in a black coat.
How far did he truly trust even Flinn? Yet he had to lead them. The
Asha&rsquo;man were his making, his responsibility.</p>

<p>When Torval saw Rand, he straightened casually and
saluted, but his expression barely changed. He had had a sneering
mouth the first time Rand ever saw him. &ldquo;My Lord Dragon,&rdquo; he said
in the accents of Tarabon, and he might have been greeting an
equal. Or being gracious to an inferior. His swaggering bow took in
Hopwil and Dashiva as well. &ldquo;I give congratulations on the conquest
of Illian. A great victory, yes? There would have been wine to
greet you, but this young&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Dedicated&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;does not seem to
understand orders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the corner, silver bells on the ends of
Narishma&rsquo;s two long dark braids made a faint sound as he
shifted. He had tanned darkly in the southern sun, but some things
about him had not changed. Older than Rand, his face made him seem
younger than Hopwil, but the red that rose in his cheeks was anger,
not embarrassment. His pride in the new-won Sword on his collar was
quiet, yet deep. Torval smiled at him, a slow smile both amused and
dangerous. Dashiva laughed, a short bark, and was still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here, Torval?&rdquo; Rand asked
roughly. He tossed the Dragon Scepter and his gauntlets down atop
the maps and followed them with his sword belt and scabbarded
sword. The maps that Torval had no reason to be studying. No need
of Lews Therin&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p>With a shrug, Torval produced a letter from his coat
pocket and handed it to Rand. &ldquo;The M&rsquo;Hael, he sent this.&rdquo; The
paper was snowy white and thick, the seal a dragon impressed in a
large oval of blue wax that glittered with golden flecks. It might
almost have been thought to come from the Dragon Reborn. Taim did
think well of himself. &ldquo;The M&rsquo;Hael said to tell you the tales
of Aes Sedai in Murandy with an army, they are true. Rumor says
they are rebels against Tar Valon&rdquo;&mdash;Torval&rsquo;s sneer
thickened with disbelief&mdash;&ldquo;but they are marching toward the
Black Tower. Soon, they may become a danger, yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand cracked the magnificent seal to bits between his
fingers. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to Caemlyn, not the Black Tower, and
they&rsquo;re no threat. My orders were clear. Leave Aes Sedai alone
unless they come after you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how can you be sure they are not a threat?&rdquo;
Torval persisted. &ldquo;Perhaps they are going to Caemlyn, as you say,
but if you are wrong, we&rsquo;ll not know before they attack
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Torval might be right,&rdquo; Dashiva put in thoughtfully.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;d trust women who put me in a box, and
these haven&rsquo;t sworn any oaths. Or have they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said leave them alone!&rdquo; Rand slapped the tabletop,
hard, and Hopwil jumped in surprise. Dashiva frowned with
irritation before hurriedly smoothing it over, but Rand was not
interested in Dashiva&rsquo;s moods. By chance&mdash;he was sure it
was chance&mdash;his hand had come down on the Dragon Scepter. His
arm trembled with the desire to take it up and stab Torval through
the heart. No need for Lews Therin at all. &ldquo;The Asha&rsquo;man are a
weapon to be aimed where I say, not to flutter around like hens
every time Taim gets frightened over a handful of Aes Sedai having
dinner at the same inn. If I must, I can come back to make myself
clearer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure there is no need of that,&rdquo; Torval said
quickly. At last something had wiped the wry twist from his mouth.
Eyes tight, he spread his hands, close to diffident, very nearly
apologetic. And plainly frightened. &ldquo;The M&rsquo;Hael, he merely
wanted you informed. Your orders are read aloud every day at
Morning Directives, after the Creed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, then.&rdquo; Rand kept his voice cool,
kept a scowl from his face by main effort. It was his precious
M&rsquo;Hael the man feared, not the Dragon Reborn. Afraid Taim
would take it amiss if something he had said brought Rand&rsquo;s
anger on Taim&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ll kill any one of you
who goes near those women in Murandy. You cut where <em>I</em>
direct.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Torval bowed rigidly, murmuring, &ldquo;As you say, my Lord
Dragon.&rdquo; His teeth were bared in an attempted smile, but his nose
was pinched, and he struggled to avoid meeting anyone&rsquo;s eyes
while seeming to avoid nothing. Dashiva yelped another laugh, and
Hopwil wore a small grin.</p>

<p>Narishma was not enjoying Torval&rsquo;s discomfort,
though, or paying it attention. He looked at Rand without blinking,
as though he sensed deep currents that the rest missed. Most women
and no few men thought him just a pretty boy, but those too-big
eyes sometimes seemed more knowing than any others.</p>

<p>Rand pulled his hand from the Dragon Scepter and
smoothed open the letter. His hands did not quite shake. Torval
smiled weakly, sourly, noticing nothing. Against the tent wall,
Narishma shifted, relaxing.</p>

<p>The refreshments arrived, then, borne by a stately
procession following Boreane, a line of Illianers and Cairhienin
and Tairens in their various liveries. There was a servant bearing
a silver tray and pitcher for each kind of wine, and two more with
trays of silver mugs for hot punch and spiced wines and fine blown
goblets for the others. A pink-faced fellow in green-and-yellow
carried a tray on which to do the pouring, and a dark woman in
black-and-gold was there to actually handle the pitchers. There
were nuts and candied fruits, cheeses and olives, each sort
requiring a serving man or woman. Under Boreane&rsquo;s direction,
they flowed in a formal dance, bowing, curtsying, one giving way to
another as they made their offerings.</p>

<p>Accepting spiced wine, Rand hoisted himself onto the
edge of the table and sat the steaming mug beside him untouched as
he busied himself with the letter. There was no address, no
preamble of any kind. Taim hated giving Rand any sort of title,
though he tried to hide the fact.</p>

<p class="note">I have the honor to report that twenty-nine
Asha&rsquo;man, ninety-seven Dedicated and three hundred twenty-two
Soldiers are now enrolled at the Black Tower. There have been a
handful of deserters, unfortunately, whose names have been
stricken, but losses in training remain acceptable.</p>

<p class="note">I now have as many as fifty recruiting parties in the
field at any given time, with the result that three or four men are
added to the rolls almost every day. In a few months, the Black
Tower will equal the White, as I said it would. In a year, Tar
Valon will tremble at our numbers.</p>

<p class="note">I harvested that blackberry bush myself. A small
bush, and thorny, but a surprising number of berries for the
size.</p>

<p class="note_sig">Mazrim Taim<br>
 M&rsquo;Hael</p>

<p>Rand grimaced, putting the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the blackberry bush&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;out of his mind. What had to be done, had to be done. The
whole world paid a price for his existence. He would die for it,
but the whole world paid.</p>

<p>There were other things to grimace over, anyway.
Three or four new men a day? Taim was optimistic. In a few months,
at that rate, there would be more men who could channel than Aes
Sedai, true, but the newest sister had years of training behind
her. And part of that specifically taught how to deal with a man
who could channel. He did not want to contemplate any encounter
between Asha&rsquo;man and Aes Sedai who knew what they were facing;
blood and regret could be the only outcome, whatever happened. The
Asha&rsquo;man were not aimed at the White Tower, though, no matter
what Taim thought. It was a convenient belief, however, if it made
Tar Valon step warily. An Asha&rsquo;man only needed to know how to
kill. If there were enough to do that at the right place and time,
if they lived long enough to, that was all they had been created
for.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many deserters, Torval?&rdquo; he said quietly. He
picked up the wine mug and took a swallow, as if the answer were
unimportant. The wine should have been warming, but the ginger and
sweet sorrel and mace tasted bitter on his tongue. &ldquo;How many losses
in training?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Torval was recovering himself over the refreshments,
rubbing his hands and arching an eyebrow at the choice of wines,
making a great show of knowing the best, making a show of lording
it. Dashiva had accepted the first offered, and stood glowering
into his twist-stemmed goblet as though it held swill. Pointing to
one of the trays, Torval cocked his head thoughtfully, but he had
the words ready on his tongue. &ldquo;Nineteen deserters, so far. The
M&rsquo;Hael, he has ordered them killed whenever they are found,
and their heads brought back for examples.&rdquo; Plucking a bit of
glazed pear from the proffered tray, he popped it into his mouth
and smiled brightly. &ldquo;Three heads hang like fruit on the
Traitor&rsquo;s Tree at this moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Rand said levelly. Men who ran now could not
be trusted not to run later, when lives depended on them standing.
And these men could not be allowed to go their own way; those
fellows back on the hills, if they escaped in a body, were less
dangerous than one man trained in the Black Tower. The
Traitor&rsquo;s Tree? Taim was a great one for naming things. But
men needed the trappings, the symbols and the names, the black
coats and the pins, to help hold them together. Until it was time
to die. &ldquo;The next time I visit the Black Tower, I want to see every
deserter&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A second piece of candied pear, halfway to
Torval&rsquo;s mouth, dropped from his fingers and streaked the
front of his fine coat. &ldquo;It might interfere with recruiting, making
that sort of effort,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;The deserters, they do not
announce themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand held the other man&rsquo;s gaze until it fell.
&ldquo;How many losses in training?&rdquo; he demanded. The sharp-nosed
Asha&rsquo;man hesitated. &ldquo;How many?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Narishma leaned forward, staring intently at Torval.
So did Hopwil. The servants continued their smooth, silent dance,
offering their trays to men who no longer saw them. Boreane took
advantage of Narishma&rsquo;s preoccupation to make sure his silver
mug held more hot water than spiced wine.</p>

<p>Torval shrugged, too casually. &ldquo;Fifty-one, all told.
Thirteen burned out, and twenty-eight dead where they stood. The
rest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The M&rsquo;Hael, he adds something to their wine, and
they do not wake.&rdquo; Abruptly his tone turned malicious. &ldquo;It can come
suddenly, at any time. One man began screaming that spiders were
crawling beneath his skin on his second day.&rdquo; He smiled viciously
at Narishma and Hopwil, and nearly so at Rand, but it was to the
other two he addressed himself, swinging his head between them.
&ldquo;You see? Not to worry if you slide into madness. You&rsquo;ll not
hurt yourselves or a soul. You go to sleep&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;forever. Kinder
than gentling, even if we knew how. Kinder than leaving you insane
<em>and</em> cut off, yes?&rdquo; Narishma stared back, taut as a
harp-string, his mug forgotten in his hand. Hopwil was once more
frowning at something only he could see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kinder,&rdquo; Rand said in a flat voice, setting the mug
back beside him on the table. Something in the wine. <em>My soul is
black with blood, and damned</em>. It was not a hard thought, not
biting or edged; a simple statement of fact. &ldquo;A mercy any man might
wish for, Torval.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Torval&rsquo;s cruel smile faded, and he stood
breathing hard. The sums were easy; one man in ten destroyed, one
man in fifty mad, and more surely to come. Early days yet, and no
way till the day you died to know you had beaten the odds. Except
that the odds would beat you, one way or another, in the end.
Whatever else, Torval stood under that threat, too.</p>

<p>Abruptly Rand became aware of Boreane. It took a
moment before he recognized the expression on her face, and when he
did, he bit back cold words. How dare she feel pity! Did she think
Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don could be won without blood? The Prophecies of
the Dragon demanded blood like rain!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave us,&rdquo; he told her, and she quietly gathered the
servants. But she still carried compassion in her eyes as she
herded them out.</p>

<p>Casting around for a way to change the mood, Rand
found nothing. Pity weakened as surely as fear, and they had to be
strong. To face what they had to face, they <em>all</em> must be
steel. His making, his responsibility.</p>

<p>Lost in his own thoughts, Narishma peered into the
steam rising from his wine, and Hopwil still tried to stare through
the side of the tent. Torval cast sideways glances at Rand and
struggled to put the scornful twist back on his mouth. Dashiva
alone appeared unaffected, with his arms folded, studying Torval as
a man might study a horse offered for sale.</p>

<p>Into the painfully stretching silence burst a husky,
windblown young man in black, with the Sword and Dragon on his
collar. Of an age with Hopwil, still not old enough to marry most
places, Fedwin Morr wore intensity more closely than his shirt; he
moved on his toes, and his eyes had the look of a hunting cat that
knew itself hunted in turn. He had been different, once, and not so
long ago. &ldquo;The Seanchan will move from Ebou Dar soon,&rdquo; he said as
he saluted. &ldquo;They mean to come against Illian next.&rdquo; Hopwil gave a
start and a gasp, jolted out of his dark study. Once again,
Dashiva&rsquo;s response was to laugh, mirthlessly this time.</p>

<p>Nodding, Rand took up the Dragon Scepter. After all,
he carried it for remembrance. The Seanchan danced to their own
tune, not the song he wished for.</p>

<p>If Rand received the announcement in silence, Torval
did not. Finding his sneer, he raised a contemptuous eyebrow. &ldquo;Did
they tell you all that, now?&rdquo; he said mockingly. &ldquo;Or have you
learned to read minds? Let me tell you something, boy. I have
fought, against Amadicians and Domani both, and no army takes a
city then packs itself up to march a thousand miles! More than a
thousand miles! Or do you think they can Travel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morr met Torval&rsquo;s derision calmly. Or if it
unsettled him at all, the only sign he gave was running a thumb
down his long sword hilt. &ldquo;I did talk to some of them. Most were
Taraboners, and more landing by ship every day, or near enough.&rdquo;
Shouldering past Torval to the table, he favored the Taraboner with
a level look. &ldquo;All stepping right quick whenever anybody with a
slurring way of speech opened a mouth.&rdquo; The older man opened his,
angrily, but the younger pressed on hurriedly, to Rand.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re putting soldiers all along the Venir Mountains. Five
hundred, sometimes a thousand together. All the way to Arran Head
already. And they&rsquo;re buying or taking every wagon and cart
within twenty leagues of Ebou Dar, and the animals to draw
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carts!&rdquo; Torval exclaimed. &ldquo;Wagons! Is it that they
mean to hold a market fair, do you think? And what fool would march
an army through mountains when there are perfectly good roads?&rdquo; He
noticed Rand watching him, and cut off with a small frown, suddenly
uncertain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you to stay low, Morr.&rdquo; Rand let anger touch
his voice. The young Asha&rsquo;man had to step back as he jumped
down from the table. &ldquo;Not to go asking the Seanchan their plans. To
look and stay low.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was careful; I didn&rsquo;t wear my pins.&rdquo;
Morr&rsquo;s eyes did not change for Rand, still hunter and hunted
in one. He seemed to be boiling inside. Had Rand not known better,
he would have thought Morr held the Power, struggling to survive
<em>saidin</em> even as it gave him life ten times over. His face
seemed to want to sweat. &ldquo;If any of the men I talked to knew where
they&rsquo;re going next, they didn&rsquo;t say, and I didn&rsquo;t
ask, but they were willing to complain over a mug of ale about
marching all the time and never standing still. In Ebou Dar, they
were soaking up all the ale in the city as fast as they could,
because they say they have to march again. And they&rsquo;re
gathering wagons, just like I said.&rdquo; That all came out in a rush,
and he clamped his teeth at the end as though to trap more words
that wanted to fly from his tongue.</p>

<p>Smiling suddenly, Rand clapped him on the shoulder.
&ldquo;You did well. The wagons would have been enough, but you did well.
Wagons are important,&rdquo; he added, turning to Torval. &ldquo;If an army
feeds off the country, it eats what it finds. Or not, if it
doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Torval had not flickered an eyelid at hearing of
Seanchan in Ebou Dar. If that tale had reached the Black Tower, why
had Taim not mentioned it? Rand hoped his smile did not look a
snarl. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s harder to arrange supply trains, but when you
have one you know there&rsquo;s fodder for the animals and beans for
the men. The Seanchan organize everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sorting through the maps, he found the one he wanted
and spread it out, weighted at one side with his sword and at the
other with the Dragon Scepter. The coast between Illian and Ebou
Dar stared up at him, rimmed for most of its length by hills and
mountains, dotted with fishing villages and small towns. The
Seanchan did organize. Ebou Dar had been theirs barely more than a
week, but the merchants&rsquo; eyes-and-ears wrote of repairs well
under way on the damage done to the city in its taking, of clean
sickhouses set up for the ill, of food and work arranged for the
poor and those driven from their homes by troubles inland. The
streets and the surrounding countryside were patrolled so that no
one need fear footpads or bandits, day or night, and while
merchants were welcome, smuggling had been cut to a trickle if not
less. Those honest Illianer merchants had been surprisingly glum
about the smuggling. What were the Seanchan organizing now?</p>

<p>The others gathered around the table as Rand perused
the map. There were roads hard along the coast, but poor straggling
things, marked as little more than cart paths. The broad trade
roads lay inland, avoiding the worst of the terrain and the worst
of what the Sea of Storms had to offer. &ldquo;Men raiding out of those
mountains could make passage difficult for anyone trying to use the
inland roads,&rdquo; he said finally. &ldquo;By controlling the mountains, they
make the roads safe as a city street. You&rsquo;re right, Morr. They
are coming to Illian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leaning on his fists, Torval glared at Morr, who had
been right when he was wrong. A grievous sin, perhaps, in
Torval&rsquo;s book. &ldquo;Even so, it will be months before they can
trouble you here,&rdquo; he said sullenly. &ldquo;A hundred Asha&rsquo;man,
fifty, placed in Illian, could destroy any army in the world before
one man crosses the causeways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt an army with <em>damane</em> is destroyed as
easily as one kills Aiel committed to an attack and caught by
surprise,&rdquo; Rand said quietly, and Torval stiffened. &ldquo;Besides, I
have to defend all of Illian, not just the city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ignoring the man, Rand traced lines across the map
with a finger. Between Arran Head and the city of Illian lay a
hundred leagues of open water, across the mouth of Kabal Deep,
where, ship captains in Illian said, their longest sounding lines
could find no bottom just a mile or so from the shore. The waves
there could overturn ships as they surged north to pound the coast
with breakers fifteen paces high. In this weather, it would be
worse. Marching around the Deep was a route of two hundred leagues
to reach the city, even keeping to the shortest ways, but if the
Seanchan pressed on from Arran Head, they could reach the border in
two weeks despite the rainstorms. Maybe less. Better to fight where
he chose, not where they did. His finger slid along the south coast
of Altara, along the Venir range, until the mountains dwindled to
hills short of Ebou Dar. Five hundred here, a thousand there. A
tantalizing string of beads dropped along the mountains. A sharp
rap might roll them back to Ebou Dar, might even pen them there
while they tried to figure out what he was up to. Or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was something else,&rdquo; Morr said abruptly,
rushing again. &ldquo;There was talk about some sort of Aes Sedai weapon.
I found where it was used, a few miles from the city. The ground
was all burned over, seared clean in the middle, a good three
hundred paces wide or more, and ruined orchards further. The sand
was melted to sheets of glass. <em>Saidin</em> was worst,
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Torval waved a hand at him dismissively. &ldquo;There could
have been Aes Sedai near when the city fell, yes? Or maybe the Seanchan
themselves did it. One sister with an <em>angreal</em> could&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand cut in. &ldquo;What do you mean, <em>saidin</em> was
worst there?&rdquo; Dashiva moved, eyeing Morr oddly, reaching as though
to seize the young man. Rand fended him off roughly. &ldquo;What do you
mean, Morr?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morr stared, mouth shut tight, running his thumb up
and down the length of his sword hilt. The heat inside of him
seemed ready to burst out. There really was sweat beading on his
face now. &ldquo;<em>Saidin</em> was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;strange,&rdquo; he said hoarsely.
His words came in rapid bursts. &ldquo;Worst there&mdash;I could&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;feel it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;in the air all around me&mdash;but strange
everywhere around Ebou Dar. And even a hundred miles away. I had to
fight it; not like always; different. Like it was alive. Sometimes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Sometimes, it didn&rsquo;t do what I wanted. Sometimes, it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;did something else. It did. I&rsquo;m not mad! It did!&rdquo; The wind
gusted, howling for a moment, shivering and snapping the tent
walls, and Morr fell silent. Narishma&rsquo;s bells chimed at a jerk
of his head, then were still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t possible,&rdquo; Dashiva muttered into the
silence, but nearly under his breath. &ldquo;It is not possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who knows what&rsquo;s possible?&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t! Do you?&rdquo; Dashiva&rsquo;s head came up in surprise, but
Rand turned to Morr, moderating his tone. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, man.&rdquo;
Not a mild tone&mdash;he could not manage that&mdash;yet
heartening, he hoped. His making, his responsibility. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
be with me to the Last Battle. I promise it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man nodded, and scrubbed at his face with
his hand as though surprised to find it damp, but he glanced at
Torval, who had gone as still as stone. Did Morr know about the
wine? It <em>was</em> a mercy, given the alternatives. A small and
bitter mercy.</p>

<p>Rand picked up Taim&rsquo;s missive, folded the page,
and thrust it into his coat pocket. One in fifty mad already, and
more to come. Was Morr next? Dashiva was surely close.
Hopwil&rsquo;s stares took on a new meaning, and even
Narishma&rsquo;s habitual quiet. Madness did not always mean
screaming about spiders. He had asked once, warily, where he knew
the answers would be true, how to cleanse the taint from <em>
saidin</em>. And got a riddle for answer. Herid Fel had claimed the
riddle stated &ldquo;sound principles, in both high philosophy and
natural philosophy,&rdquo; but he had not seen any way to apply it to the
problem at hand. Had Fel been killed because he might have puzzled
out the riddle? Rand had a hint at the answer, or thought he might,
a guess that could be disastrously wrong. Hints and riddles were
not answers, yet he had to do something. If the taint was not
cleansed somehow, Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don might find a world already
ruined by madmen. What had to be done, had to be done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be wondrous,&rdquo; Torval said in a near
whisper, &ldquo;but how could anyone short of the Creator or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; He
trailed off uneasily.</p>

<p>Rand had not realized he had spoken any of his
thoughts aloud. Narishma&rsquo;s eyes, and Morr&rsquo;s, and
Hopwil&rsquo;s, belonged in one face, shining with sudden hope.
Dashiva looked poleaxed. Rand hoped he had not said too much. Some
secrets had to be kept. Including what he would do next.</p>

<p>In short order, Hopwil was running for his horse to
ride to the ridge with orders for the nobles, Morr and Dashiva to
find Flinn and the other Asha&rsquo;man, and Torval was striding off
to Travel back to the Black Tower with commands for Taim. Narishma
was last, and thinking of Aes Sedai and Seanchan and weapons, Rand
sent him away as well, with careful instructions that made the
young man&rsquo;s mouth tighten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak to no one,&rdquo; Rand finished softly, gripping
Narishma&rsquo;s arm hard. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t fail me. Not by a
hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t fail,&rdquo; Narishma said, unblinking. With
a quick salute, he was gone, too.</p>

<p><em>Dangerous</em>, a voice whispered in Rand&rsquo;s
head. <em>Oh, yes, very dangerous, maybe too dangerous. But it
might work; it might. In any event, you must kill Torval now. You
must</em>.</p>

<p>Weiramon entered the council tent, shouldering aside
Gregorin and Tolmeran, trying to shoulder aside Rosana and
Semaradrid, the lot of them eager to tell Rand that the men in the
trees had decided wisely after all. They found him laughing till
tears rolled down his face. Lews Therin had come back. Or else he
really was mad already. Either way, it was reason to laugh.</p>
