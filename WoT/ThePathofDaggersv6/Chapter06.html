<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">E</span>layne
ran, too, of course, holding her skirts up,
and quickly took the lead on the well-worn dirt path. Only Aviendha
stayed close, though she seemed to have no idea how to run in a
dress, divided or not; tired as she was, she certainly would have
passed Elayne otherwise. Everyone else strung out behind them along
the narrow, winding track. None of the Atha&rsquo;an Miere would
push by Renaile, and despite her silk trousers she could not move
very fast carrying the Bowl hugged to her chest. Nynaeve had no
such compunctions, elbowing past and running hard, shouting for
people to get out of her way when she stumbled into them whether
they were Windfinders, Kinswomen, or Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>Bounding down the hillside, tripping and catching
herself, Elayne wanted to laugh despite the urgency. Despite the
danger. Lini and her mother had been death on running and climbing
trees from the time she was twelve, but it was not just the sheer
pleasure of running again that made delight bubble up in her
middle. She had behaved as a queen was supposed to behave, and it
had worked <em>exactly</em> as it was supposed to! She had taken
charge, to lead people out of danger, and they <em>followed</em>!
Her whole life had been training for this. It was satisfaction that
made her laugh, and the hot glow of pride seemed about to burst
through her skin like the radiance of <em>saidar</em>.</p>

<p>Rounding the last curve, she pounded down the final
straight beside one of the tall white-plastered barns. And her toe
caught an almost buried stone. She pitched forward heavily,
windmilling her arms, and suddenly she was somersaulting
head-over-heels through the air. No time even to yell. With a thump
that jarred her teeth and took all the wind out of her, she landed
hard at the foot at the path, sitting right in front of Birgitte.
For an instant she could not even think, and when she could, little
satisfaction remained. So much for queenly dignity. Brushing her
hair out of her face, she tried to catch her breath as she waited
for Birgitte&rsquo;s cutting comment. This was a chance for the
other woman to play the older and wiser sister with a vengeance,
and she seldom let an opportunity pass.</p>

<p>To Elayne&rsquo;s surprise, Birgitte heaved her to her
feet even before Aviendha could reach her, and without so much as
the faint grin on Aviendha&rsquo;s face. All Elayne could feel from
her Warder was a sense of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;focus; she thought an arrow nocked
on a drawn bowstring might feel that way. &ldquo;Do we run or fight?&rdquo;
Birgitte asked. &ldquo;I recognized those Seanchan fliers from Falme, and
truth for true, I suggest running. My bow is the ordinary sort,
today.&rdquo; Aviendha gave her a slight frown, and Elayne sighed;
Birgitte <em>had</em> to learn to guard her tongue if she really
intended to hide who she was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we run,&rdquo; Nynaeve panted, laboring down the
final stretch of path. &ldquo;Fight or run! Fool question! Do you think
we&rsquo;re utter&mdash;? Light! What are they doing?&rdquo; Her voice
started climbing and kept right on. &ldquo;Alise! Alise, where are you?
Alise! Alise!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a start, Elayne realized the farm was boiling as
badly as it had when Careane&rsquo;s face was recognized. Maybe
worse. A hundred and forty-seven Kinswomen inhabited the place at
present, Alise had reported, including fifty-four red-belted Wise
Women sent out days ago and a number of others who had been passing
through the city; now it looked as though every last one was
running somewhere, and a good many of the other women, too. Most of
the Tarasin Palace servants in their green-and-white livery dashed
this way and that carrying burdens. Ducks and chickens darted
through the tumult, flapping and squawking, adding to the apparent
confusion. Elayne even saw a <em>Warder</em>, Vandene&rsquo;s
grizzled Jaem, trot by with his wiry arms wrapped around a big jute
sack!</p>

<p>Alise appeared as though from the air, poised and
collected despite the perspiration on her face. Every strand of her
hair was in place, and her dress looked as if she were merely out
for a stroll. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to screech,&rdquo; she said calmly,
planting hands on hips. &ldquo;Birgitte told me what those big birds are,
and I thought we might be leaving sooner rather than later,
especially with all of you galloping down the hill like the Dark
One himself was after you. I told everybody to collect one clean
dress apiece, three changes of shift and stockings, soap, mending
baskets, and all the coin they have. That, and no more. The last
ten to finish will do the washing-up till we get where we&rsquo;re
going; that will speed their feet. I told those servants to gather
all the food they could, too, just in case. And your Warders.
Sensible fellows, most of them. Surprisingly sensible, for men.
Does being a Warder do something to them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve stood there with her jaw hanging, ready to
issue orders and none left to give. Emotions played across her face
too fast to catch. &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; she mumbled finally. And sourly.
Suddenly she brightened. &ldquo;The women who aren&rsquo;t Kin. Yes! They
have to be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Calm yourself,&rdquo; Alise broke in, making a soothing
gesture. &ldquo;They are already gone, for the most part. Mainly those
with husbands or families they&rsquo;re worried about. I
couldn&rsquo;t have held those back had I wanted. But a good thirty
think those birds really are Shadowspawn, and want to stay as close
to Aes Sedai as they can get.&rdquo; A sharp sniff said what she thought
of that. &ldquo;Now, you just gather yourself. Drink some cool water; not
too fast. Put a little on your face. I have to keep an eye on
things.&rdquo; Casting her eye over the bustle, everybody running in
bounds, Alise shook her head. &ldquo;Some would slack off if Trollocs
were coming over the hill, and most of the noblewomen never really
do get used to our rules. For sure, I&rsquo;ll need to remind two or
three before we go.&rdquo; With that, she waded serenely back into the
turmoil of the farmyard and left Nynaeve gaping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Elayne said, brushing her skirt, &ldquo;you did say
she was a very capable woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never said that,&rdquo; Nynaeve snapped. &ldquo;I never said &lsquo;very.&rsquo; Hmmph! Where did my hat get to? Thinks she knows
everything. I&rsquo;ll wager she doesn&rsquo;t know <em>that</em>!&rdquo;
She flounced off in a different direction than Alise.</p>

<p>Elayne stared after her. Her <em>hat</em>? She would
have liked to know where her own hat had gone to&mdash;it was a
beautiful thing&mdash;but really! Maybe being in a circle working
that much of the Power, using an <em>angreal</em> doing it, had
unsettled Nynaeve&rsquo;s wits temporarily. She still felt a trifle
odd, herself, as though she could pluck little bits of <em>
saidar</em> out of the air around her. In any case, she had other
matters to worry about right then. Like being ready to get away
before the Seanchan descended. From what she had seen in Falme,
they really might bring a hundred <em>damane</em>, or more, and
based on the little Egwene would let herself say of her captivity,
most of those women really would be eager to help collar others.
She said that what had turned her stomach most had been the sight
of <em>damane</em> from Seanchan laughing with their <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em>, fawning and playing with them, well-trained
hounds with their affectionate handlers. Egwene said some of the
women collared in Falme had been that way, too. It made
Elayne&rsquo;s blood run cold. She would die before letting them put
that leash on her! And she would as soon let the Forsaken have what
she had found as the Seanchan. She went running to the cistern,
Aviendha at her side breathing almost as hard as she was
herself.</p>

<p>It seemed Alise really had thought of everything,
though. The <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> were already stowed away on
the packhorses. The unsearched panniers remained full of jumbled
odds and ends and the Light knew what, but those she and Aviendha
had emptied now bulged with coarse sacks of flour and salt, beans
and lentils. A handful of stablefolk minded the packanimals instead
of running about with their arms full. Doing Alise&rsquo;s bidding,
no doubt. Even Birgitte went trotting off at the woman&rsquo;s call
with no more than a rueful grin!</p>

<p>Elayne lifted canvas covers to examine the <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em> as well as she could without unloading them
again. Everything appeared to be there, a bit tumbled together in
two panniers, not enough to fill them, but nothing broken. Not that
anything short of the One Power itself <em>could</em> break most
<em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, yet even so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Aviendha took a seat cross-legged on the ground,
blotting sweat from her face with a large, plain linen handkerchief
that seemed very much at odds with her pretty silk riding dress.
Even she was beginning to show weariness. &ldquo;What are you muttering
about, Elayne? You sound like Nynaeve. This Alise has only saved us
the trouble of packing those things ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne colored faintly. She had not meant to speak
aloud. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t want anyone handling them who
doesn&rsquo;t know what they are doing, Aviendha.&rdquo; Some <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em> could trigger even for people unable to
channel, if they did the wrong thing, but the truth was, she did
not want anyone handling them. They were hers! The Hall was not
going to hand these over to some other sister just because she was
older and more <em>experienced</em>, or hide them away because
studying <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> was too dangerous. With this
many examples to study, maybe she could finally figure out how to
make <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> that worked every time; there had
been far too many failures and half-successes. &ldquo;They need someone
who knows what she&rsquo;s doing,&rdquo; she said, lashing the stiff
canvas back in place.</p>

<p>Order began to appear out of pandemonium more rapidly
than Elayne expected, though not as fast as she could have wished.
Of course, she admitted reluctantly, nothing slower than
instantaneous could have matched her wishes. Unable to keep her
eyes off the sky, she sent Careane running back to the top of the
hill to watch toward Ebou Dar. The stocky Green grumbled a bit
under her breath before curtsying, and even frowned at the
Kinswomen dashing about as if on the point of suggesting one of
them instead, but Elayne wanted someone who would not faint at the
sight of &ldquo;Shadowspawn&rdquo; approaching, and Careane stood lowest among
the sisters. Adeleas and Vandene brought out Ispan between them,
firmly shielded and the leather sack back over her head. She walked
quite easily, and nothing visible said that anything at all had
been done to her, except&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Ispan kept her hands folded at her
waist, never so much as trying to raise the sack for a peek, and
when she was boosted into a saddle, she held out her wrists to be
corded to the pommel without being told. If she was that amenable,
perhaps they had learned something from her. Elayne just did not
want to contemplate how the learning might have been achieved.</p>

<p>There were&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;bumps, of course, of sorts, even
with what might be rushing toward them. What surely was rushing
toward them. Nynaeve getting her blue-plumed hat back was not
really a bump, though it almost turned into one; Alise <em>had</em>
found it, and handed it back telling Nynaeve she needed to shield
her face from the sun if she wanted to keep that smooth pretty
skin. An open-mouthed Nynaeve watched the graying woman hurry off
to deal with one of the numerous small problems, then
ostentatiously shoved the hat under a strap of her saddlebags.</p>

<p>From the beginning Nynaeve set about flattening the
real bumps, but Alise was nearly always there first, and where
Alise met a bump, the bump flattened itself. Several noblewomen
demanded help packing their belongings, only to be informed in no
uncertain terms that she had meant what she said and if they did
not hop to it, they could live in what they stood in. They hopped.
Some, and not only nobles, changed their minds about going when
they learned the destination was Andor, and were literally chased
away. Afoot, and told to keep running as long as they could. Every
horse was needed, but they had to be well away before the Seanchan
appeared; at the very least they could be expected to put anyone
near the farm to the question. As should have been expected,
Nynaeve got into a shouting match with Renaile over the Bowl, and
the turtle Talaan had used, which Renaile apparently had tucked
behind her sash. Hardly had they reached the stage of waving arms,
however, than Alise was right there, and in short order the Bowl
was back in Sareitha&rsquo;s care and the turtle in
Merilille&rsquo;s. Following which, Elayne was treated to the sight
of Alise shaking her finger under the astonished nose of the
Windfinder to the Mistress of the Ships to the Atha&rsquo;an Miere,
delivering a tongue-lashing on the subject of theft that left
Renaile spluttering indignantly. Nynaeve did a little spluttering,
too, stalking away empty-handed, yet Elayne thought she had never
seen anyone look so forlorn.</p>

<p>All in all, it did not take very long, though. The
remaining women who had been at the farm gathered under the
watchful eyes of the Knitting Circle&mdash;and of Alise, who
carefully noted the last ten to arrive, all but two in fine
embroidered silks, not much different from Elayne&rsquo;s.
Definitely not Kinswomen. Elayne felt sure they really would do the
washing-up anyway; Alise would not let a little thing like noble
birth stand in her way. The Windfinders lined up with their horses,
surprisingly silent except for Renaile, who muttered imprecations
whenever she saw Alise. Careane was summoned back from the hilltop.
The Warders brought the sisters their mounts. Almost everyone kept
an eye on the sky, and <em>saidar</em> made halos around all of the
older Aes Sedai and most of the Windfinders. Around a few of the
Kin, as well.</p>

<p>Leading her mare to the head of the line, at the
cistern, Nynaeve fingered the <em>angreal</em> still on her hand as
if she were going to be the one to make the gateway, ridiculous as
the very idea might be. For one thing, though she had washed her
face&mdash;and donned her hat; strangely, all things considered&mdash;she still tottered whenever her self-control slipped. Lan
stayed practically at her shoulder, stone-faced as always, but if
ever there was a man ready to catch a woman when she fell, it was
he. Even with the bracelet-and-rings, Nynaeve might not be able to
manage enough to weave a gateway. More important, she had been
dashing about the farm ever since they first arrived; Elayne had
spent a considerable time holding <em>saidar</em> right where they
now stood. She knew that spot. Nynaeve scowled sulkily when Elayne
embraced the Source, but at least she had sense enough to say
nothing.</p>

<p>Right from the first Elayne wished that she had asked
Aviendha for the woman-cloaked-in-her-own-hair; she was weary, too,
and all the <em>saidar</em> she could draw was barely enough to
form the weave so it would work. The flows wavered in her grasp
almost as if trying to twist free, then snapped into place so
suddenly that she jumped; channeling when you were tired was not at
all like other times, but this was the worst ever. At least the
familiar vertical slash of silver appeared as it should, and
widened into an opening right alongside the cistern. An opening no
bigger than the one Aviendha had made, and at that, Elayne was
grateful it was large enough to fit a horse through. At the last,
she had not been certain it would be. Gasps rose from the
Kinswomen, seeing a view of an upland meadow suddenly standing
between them and the familiar gray bulk of the cistern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have let me try,&rdquo; Nynaeve said softly.
Softly, but with a sharp point even so. &ldquo;You nearly flubbed it
altogether.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha gave Nynaeve a flat look that almost made
Elayne grab her arm. The longer they remained near-sisters, the
more she seemed to think she had to defend Elayne&rsquo;s honor; if
they did become first-sisters, Elayne could see having to keep her
away from Nynaeve, and Birgitte, completely!</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s done, Nynaeve,&rdquo; she said quickly.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all that counts.&rdquo; Nynaeve directed a flat look at her
and muttered something about the day being prickly, as if <em>
Elayne</em> were the one showing her snappish side.</p>

<p>Birgitte was the first through, grinning impudently
at Lan, leading her horse with her bow already in her other hand.
Elayne could sense eagerness in her, a touch of satisfaction,
perhaps that this time she had the lead instead of Lan&mdash;there
was always a bit of rivalry between Warders&mdash;and a small
measure of wariness. Very small. Elayne knew that meadow well;
Gareth Bryne had taught her to ride not far from there. About five
miles over those first sparsely treed hills lay the manor house of
one of her mother&rsquo;s estates. One of <em>her</em> estates; she
had to get used to that. The seven families who tended the house
and its grounds would be the only people for half a day&rsquo;s
journey in any direction.</p>

<p>Elayne had chosen that destination because they could
reach Caemlyn in two weeks from there. And because the estate was
so isolated, she might be entering Caemlyn before anyone knew she
was in Andor. That could be a very necessary precaution; at various
times in Andor&rsquo;s history, rivals for the Rose Crown had been
kept as &ldquo;guests&rdquo; until they relinquished their claims. Her mother
had kept two, until she took the throne. With luck, she could have
a solid base established by the time Egwene and the others
arrived.</p>

<p>Lan took Mandarb right behind Birgitte&rsquo;s brown
gelding, and Nynaeve lurched as if to rush after the black
warhorse, then pulled herself up short with a level stare that
dared Elayne to say a word. Fiddling furiously with her reins, she
made a visible effort to look anywhere except through the gateway
after Lan. Her lips moved. After a moment, Elayne realized that she
was <em>counting</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;we really don&rsquo;t
have time for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Move along,&rdquo; Alise called from the rear, the sound
of her hands clapping a sharp punctuating crack. &ldquo;No pushing or
shoving, now, but I&rsquo;ll have no laggards either! Move
along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s head swung wildly, pained indecision
painting her face. For some reason she touched her wide hat, a few
of its blue plumes broken and drooping, before pulling her hand
away. &ldquo;Oh, that goat-kissing old&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&rdquo; she growled, the rest lost
as she dragged her mare through the gateway. Elayne sniffed. And
Nynaeve had the nerve to speak to anybody about <em>their</em>
language! She wished she could have heard the rest, though; she
already knew the first bit.</p>

<p>Alise continued her urging, but there really did not
seem to be much need after the first. Even the Windfinders hurried,
glancing worriedly over their shoulders at the sky. Even Renaile,
who mumbled something about Alise that Elayne noted in the back of
her head. Though calling someone &ldquo;a fish-loving scavenger&rdquo; did seem
rather mild. She would have expected the Sea Folk to eat fish all
the time.</p>

<p>Alise herself brought up the very rear, except for
the remaining Warders, as if to herd even the packhorses along. She
paused long enough to hand Elayne her green-plumed hat.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll want to keep the sun off that sweet face of yours,&rdquo;
she said with a smile. &ldquo;Such a pretty girl. No need to turn to
leather before your time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha, sitting on the ground nearby, fell over
backward and kicked her heels laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll ask her to find <em>you</em> a
hat. With lots of plumes, and big bows,&rdquo; Elayne said in dulcet
tones before quickly following the Kinswoman. That certainly cut
off Aviendha&rsquo;s laughter.</p>

<p>The gently rolling meadow was broad and nearly a mile
long, surrounded by hills taller than those she had left behind,
and by trees she knew, oak and pine and blackwood, sourgum and
leatherleaf and fir, thick forest with good, tall timber to south
and west and east, though there might not be any cutting this year.
Most of the more scattered trees to the north, toward the manor,
were better suited for firewood. Small gray boulders dotted the
thick brown grass here and there, and not even a withered stalk
marked the death of a wildflower. That was not so different from
the south.</p>

<p>For once Nynaeve was not peering at the surrounding
countryside trying to find Lan. He and Birgitte would not be gone
long anyway, not here. Instead she strode briskly among the horses,
ordering people to mount in a loud, commanding voice, chivvying the
servants with the pack animals, curtly telling some of the
Kinswomen who had no horses that any child could walk five miles,
shouting at a slender Altaran noblewoman with a scar on her cheek
and carrying a bundle nearly as big as herself that if she had been
fool enough to bring all of her dresses then she could carry them.
Alise had gathered the Atha&rsquo;an Miere around her and was
instructing them on how to mount a horse. For a wonder, they
actually appeared to be paying attention. Nynaeve glanced her way
and seemed pleased to see Alise standing in one spot. Until Alise
smiled encouragingly and motioned her to go on with what she was
doing.</p>

<p>For an instant Nynaeve stood stock-still, staring at
the woman. Then she came striding through the grass to Elayne.
Reaching up to her hat with both hands, she hesitated, glowering up
at it her through her lashes before giving it a twitch straight.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just let her take care of everything this time,&rdquo; she
said in a suspiciously reasonable tone. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just see how
well she does with those&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Sea Folk. Yes, we will.&rdquo; Too
reasonable a tone by half. Abruptly she frowned at the still-open
gateway. &ldquo;Why are you holding it? Let go.&rdquo; Aviendha was frowning,
too.</p>

<p>Elayne drew a deep breath. She had thought about
this, and there was no other way, but Nynaeve would try to argue
her out of it, and there no time for arguing. Through the gateway,
the farmyard stood empty, even the chickens finally frightened away
by the hubbub, yet how long before it filled up again? She studied
her weave, melded together so snugly that only a few threads
remained distinct. She could see every flow, of course, but except
for those few, they appeared inseparably combined. &ldquo;Take everyone
to the manor house, Nynaeve,&rdquo; she said. The sun did not have very
much farther to fall; perhaps two hours of light remained. &ldquo;Master
Hornwell will be surprised at so many visitors arriving at dark,
but tell him you&rsquo;re guests of the girl who cried over the
redbird with the broken wing; he&rsquo;ll remember that. I will be
along as soon as I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elayne,&rdquo; Aviendha began in a surprisingly anxious
voice, and at the same time, Nynaeve said sharply, &ldquo;Just what do
you think you&rsquo;re&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was only one way to stop it. Elayne plucked one
of the discernible threads free of the weave; it wavered and
flailed like a living tentacle; it fuzzed and spluttered, tiny
fluffs of <em>saidar</em> breaking off and fading away. She had not
noticed that when Aviendha unmade her weave, but she had only seen
the tail of that, really. &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; she told Nynaeve. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
wait for the rest until you are all out of sight.&rdquo; Nynaeve stared
out, her jaw hanging. &ldquo;It has to be done,&rdquo; Elayne sighed. &ldquo;The
Seanchan will be at the farm in hours, for sure. Even if they wait
until tomorrow, what if one of the <em>damane</em> has the Talent
to read residues? Nynaeve, I won&rsquo;t give Traveling to the
Seanchan. I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve growled something under her breath about the
Seanchan that must have been particularly pithy, judging by her
tone. &ldquo;Well, <em>I</em> won&rsquo;t let you burn yourself out!&rdquo; she
said aloud. &ldquo;Now, put that back! Before the whole thing explodes
the way Vandene said. You could kill all of us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It cannot be put back,&rdquo; Aviendha said, laying a hand
on Nynaeve&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;She has begun, and now she must finish. You
must do as she says, Nynaeve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s brows drew down. &ldquo;Must&rdquo; was a word she
did not like hearing one bit, not applied to her. She was not a
fool, though, so after a bit of glaring&mdash;at Elayne, at the
gateway, at Aviendha, at the world in general&mdash;she flung her
arms around Elayne in a hug that made her ribs creak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You be careful, you hear me,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;If you
get yourself killed, I swear I&rsquo;ll skin you alive!&rdquo; In spite of
everything, Elayne burst out laughing. Nynaeve snorted, pushing her
out to arm&rsquo;s length by her shoulders. &ldquo;You know what I mean,&rdquo;
she grumbled. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t think I don&rsquo;t mean it, because I
do! I do,&rdquo; she added in a softer voice. &ldquo;You take care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It took Nynaeve a moment to gather herself, blinking
and pulling her blue riding gloves tight. There seemed to be a hint
of moisture in her eyes, though that could not have been; Nynaeve
made other people cry, she did not cry herself. &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; she
said loudly. &ldquo;Alise, if you don&rsquo;t have everyone ready yet&mdash;&rdquo; Turning, she cut off with a strangled croak.</p>

<p>Those who were supposed to be mounted were, even the
Atha&rsquo;an Miere. The Warders were all gathered around the other
sisters; Lan and Birgitte had returned, and Birgitte watched Elayne
worriedly. The servants had the pack animals in a line, and the
Kinswomen were waiting patiently, most afoot except for the
Knitting Circle. A number of horses that could have been used for
riding were loaded with sacks of food and bundles of belongings.
Women who had brought more than Alise allowed&mdash;none of them
Kin&mdash;carried their bundles on their own backs. The slender
noble with the scar was bent at an awkward angle beneath hers, and
glaring at anyone but Alise. Every woman who could channel was
staring at the gateway. And every woman who had been there to hear
Vandene tell of the dangers watched that one whipping filament as
she would have a red adder.</p>

<p>It was Alise herself who brought Nynaeve her horse.
And straightened the blue-plumed hat as Nynaeve put a foot in the
stirrup. Nynaeve turned the plump mare north with Lan riding
Mandarb at her side and a look of utter mortification on her face.
Why she did not just set Alise down, Elayne did not understand. To
hear Nynaeve tell it, she had been putting women older than herself
in their place since she was little more than a girl. And she was
Aes Sedai, now, after all; that should carry mountains of weight
with any Kinswoman.</p>

<p>As the column began to wend its way toward the hills,
Elayne looked at Aviendha and Birgitte. Aviendha simply stood there
with her arms folded beneath her breasts; she had the
woman-wrapped-in-her-own-hair <em>angreal</em> clutched in one
hand. Birgitte took Lioness&rsquo;s reins from Elayne, adding them
to those of her own horse and Aviendha&rsquo;s, then walked over to
a small boulder twenty paces away and sat down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You two must,&rdquo; Elayne began, then coughed when
Aviendha&rsquo;s eyebrows shot up in surprise. Sending Aviendha out
of danger was impossible without shaming her. Perhaps impossible
altogether. &ldquo;I want you to go with the others,&rdquo; she told Birgitte.
&ldquo;And take Lioness. Aviendha and I can take turns riding her
gelding. I&rsquo;d like a walk before bedtime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you ever treat a man half as well as you do that
horse,&rdquo; Birgitte said dryly, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll be yours for life. I think
I&rsquo;ll just sit awhile; I&rsquo;ve ridden long enough today.
I&rsquo;m not at your beck and call all the time. We can play that
game in front of the sisters and the other Warders, to spare your
blushes, but you and I know better.&rdquo; Despite the mocking words,
what Elayne felt from her was affection. No; stronger than
affection. Her own eyes stung suddenly. Her death would hurt
Birgitte to the bone&mdash;the Warder bond made that certain&mdash;but it was friendship that made her stay now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am thankful to have two friends such as you,&rdquo; she
said simply. Birgitte grinned at her as if she had said something
silly.</p>

<p>Aviendha, however, blushed furiously and stared at
Birgitte, wide-eyed and flustered, as though the Warder&rsquo;s
presence were to blame for her fiery cheeks. Hurriedly she shifted
her gaze to the people still short of the first hill, perhaps half
a mile distant. &ldquo;Best to wait until they are out of sight,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;but you cannot wait too long. Once you have started the
unweaving, the flows begin to grow&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;slick&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;after a time.
Letting one slip free before it is out of the weave is the same as
letting go of the weave; it will fall into whatever it wishes,
then. But you must not hurry, either. Each thread must be pulled
free as far as it will go. The more that come loose, the easier
others will be to see, but you must always pick the thread that is
easiest to see.&rdquo; Smiling warmly, she pressed her fingers firmly
against Elayne&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;You will do well, if you are
careful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It did not sound that difficult. She just had to be
careful. It seemed to take a long time for the last woman to vanish
over the hill, the slender noble bent under the bulk of her
dresses. The sun barely appeared to settle any at all, but it
seemed like hours. What did Aviendha mean precisely by &ldquo;slick&rdquo;? She
could not explain beyond variations on the word; they became
difficult to hold, that was all.</p>

<p>Elayne found out as soon as she began again. &ldquo;Slick&rdquo;
was what you would get if you coated a live eel with grease. She
gritted her teeth just holding on to that first thread, and that
was on top of trying to pull it free. All that stopped her from
gasping in relief when the thread of Air began whipping about,
finally loose, was that there were more to go. If they became much
more &ldquo;slick,&rdquo; she was not sure she could manage it. Aviendha
watched closely, but did not say another word, though she always
had an encouraging smile when Elayne needed one. Elayne could not
see Birgitte&mdash;she did not dare look away from her work&mdash;yet she could feel her, a small knot of rock-solid confidence in
her own head, enough confidence to fill her.</p>

<p>Sweat slid down her face, down her back and belly,
until she began to feel &ldquo;slick&rdquo; herself. A bath tonight would be
most welcome. No, she could not think of that. All attention on the
weaves. They <em>were</em> getting harder to handle, quivering in
her grip as soon as she touched one, but they still came free, and
every time one thread began to lash about, another seemed to leap
out of the mass, to suddenly be clearly perceptible where there had
only been solid <em>saidar</em> before. To her eye the gateway
resembled some monstrous, distorted hundred-heads on the bottom of
a pond, surrounded by flailing tendrils, every one thickly haired
with threads of the Power that grew and writhed and vanished only
to be replaced by new. The opening visible to anyone flexed along
its edges, changing shape and even size continuously. Her legs
began to tremble; strain stung her eyes as much as sweat did. She
did not know how much longer she could go on. Gritting her teeth,
she fought. One thread at a time. One thread at a time.</p>

<p>A thousand miles away, less than a hundred paces away
through the shuddering gateway, dozens of soldiers swept around the
white farm buildings, short men carrying crossbows, in brown
breastplates and painted helmets that looked like the heads of huge
insects. Behind them came a woman with red panels bearing silver
lightning on her skirts, a bracelet on her wrist linked by a
silvery leash to the collar around the neck of a woman in gray, and
then another <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> and her <em>damane</em>, then
another pair. One of the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> pointed at the
gateway, and the glow of <em>saidar</em> abruptly enveloped her
<em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get down!&rdquo; Elayne screamed, falling backward, out of
sight of the farmyard, and silver-blue lightning shot through the
gateway with a roar that filled her ears, forking savagely in every
direction. Her hair lifted, every strand trying to stand on its
own, and thunderous fountains of earth erupted wherever one of the
forks struck. Dirt and pebbles rained down on her.</p>

<p>Hearing returned suddenly, and a man&rsquo;s voice
from the other side of the opening, a slurred, drawling accent that
made her skin crawl as much as the words &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;must take them
alive, you fools!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly one of the soldiers was leaping into the
meadow right in front of her. Birgitte&rsquo;s arrow punched through
the clenched fist embossed on his leather breastplate. A second
Seanchan soldier stumbled over the first as he fell, and
Aviendha&rsquo;s belt knife stabbed into his throat before he could
recover. Arrows flew from Birgitte&rsquo;s bow like hail; with one
boot on the horses&rsquo; reins, she grinned grimly as she shot. The
trembling horses tossed their heads and danced as if they would
jerk free and run, but Birgitte simply stood and shot as fast as
she could draw. Shouts from beyond the gateway said Birgitte
Silverbow still struck home with every shaft she loosed. Answer
came, quick as bad thought, black streaks, crossbow bolts. So
quick, all happening so fast. Aviendha fell, blood running over the
fingers clutching her right arm, but she let go of her wound
immediately, crawling clear, scrabbling on the ground for the <em>
angreal</em>, her face set. Birgitte cried out; dropping her bow,
she grabbed her thigh where a quarrel stuck out. Elayne felt the
stab of agony as sharply as if it were her own.</p>

<p>Desperately, she seized another thread from where she
lay half on her back. And realized to her horror after one tug that
it was all she could do to hold on. Had the thread moved? Had it
slipped free any at all? If it had, she did not dare let go. The
thread trembled greasily in her grasp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alive, I said!&rdquo; that Seanchan voice roared. &ldquo;Anyone
who kills a woman gets no share of the taking gold!&rdquo; The flurry of
crossbow bolts ceased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wish to take me?&rdquo; Aviendha shouted. &ldquo;Then come
and dance with me!&rdquo; <em>Saidar</em>&rsquo;s glow abruptly surrounded
her, dim even with the <em>angreal</em>, and balls of fire sprang
into being in front of the gateway and sprayed through again and
again. Not very large balls, but the blasts as they burst back in
Altara sounded in a steady stream. Aviendha panted with effort,
though; her face glistened with sweat. Birgitte had recovered her
bow; she looked every inch the hero of legend, blood streaming down
her leg, barely able to stand, but an arrow half drawn, searching
for a target.</p>

<p>Elayne tried to control her breathing. She could not
embrace one shred more of the Power, nothing to help. &ldquo;The two of
you must get away,&rdquo; she said. She could not believe how she
sounded, calm as ice; she knew she should have been wailing. Her
heart was trying to pound through her ribs. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how
much longer I can hold this.&rdquo; That held true for the entire weave
as much as for that single thread. Was it sliding? Was it? &ldquo;Go, as
fast as you can. The other side of the hills should be safe, but
every span you can cover gains something. Go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Birgitte growled in the Old Tongue, but nothing that
Elayne knew. It sounded like phrases she would like to learn. If
there was ever a chance. Birgitte went on in words Elayne could
understand. &ldquo;You let that bloody thing go before I tell you, and
you won&rsquo;t have to worry about waiting for Nynaeve to skin you;
I&rsquo;ll do it myself. And then let her have a turn. Just be quiet
and hang on! Aviendha, get around here&mdash;behind that thing!&mdash;can you keep that up from behind it?&mdash;get around here
and on one of these bloody horses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As long as I can see where to weave,&rdquo; Aviendha
replied, staggering to her feet. She wobbled sideways and barely
caught herself short of falling. Blood flowed down her sleeve from
a wicked gash. &ldquo;I think I can.&rdquo; She vanished behind the gateway,
and the fireballs continued. You could see through a gateway from
the other side, though it appeared to be a heat haze hanging in the
air. You could not walk through from that side, though&mdash;the
attempt would be extremely painful&mdash;and when Aviendha
reappeared, she was stumbling well wide. Birgitte helped her mount
her gelding, but <em>backwards</em>, of all things!</p>

<p>When Birgitte motioned fiercely to her, Elayne did
not bother with shaking her head. For one thing, she feared what
might happen if she did. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not certain I can hold on if I
try to get up.&rdquo; In truth, she was not certain she <em>could</em>
get up; tired was no longer in it; her muscles were water. &ldquo;Ride as
fast as you can. I&rsquo;ll hold on as long as I&rsquo;m able.
Please, go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Muttering curses in the Old Tongue&mdash;they had to
be; nothing else ever had the sound!&mdash;Birgitte shoved the
horses&rsquo; reins into Aviendha&rsquo;s hands. Nearly falling
twice, she hobbled to Elayne and bent to take her by the shoulders.
&ldquo;You can hang on,&rdquo; she said, her voice filled with the same
conviction Elayne felt from her. &ldquo;I never met a Queen of Andor
before you, but I&rsquo;ve known queens like you. A backbone of
steel and a lion&rsquo;s heart. You can do it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slowly she pulled Elayne up, not waiting for an
answer, her face tight, every stab in her leg echoing in
Elayne&rsquo;s head. Elayne quivered with the effort of holding the
weave, holding that one thread; she was surprised to find herself
erect. And alive. Birgitte&rsquo;s leg throbbed madly in her head.
She tried not to lean on Birgitte, but her own trembling limbs
would not support her completely. As they lurched toward the
horses, each half leaning on the other, she kept looking back over
her shoulder. She could hold a weave without looking at it&mdash;she could normally&mdash;but she needed to reassure herself that
she really did still have a grip on that one thread, that it was
not slipping. The gateway now appeared like no weave she had ever
seen, twisting wildly, wreathed with fuzzed tentacles.</p>

<p>With a groan, Birgitte heaved her into her saddle
more than helped her. Backward, just like Aviendha! &ldquo;You have to
see,&rdquo; she explained, limping to her gelding; holding the reins of
all three horses, she pulled herself up painfully. Without a sound,
but Elayne felt the agony. &ldquo;You do what needs doing and leave where
we&rsquo;re going to me.&rdquo; The horses leaped away, perhaps as much
from eagerness to be gone as from Birgitte&rsquo;s heel in her own
mount&rsquo;s flank.</p>

<p>Elayne hung on to the high cantle of her saddle as
grimly as she did to the weave, to <em>saidar</em> itself. The
galloping horse flung her about, and it was all she could do to
remain in the saddle. Aviendha used her saddle&rsquo;s cantle as a
prop to keep herself upright; her mouth hung open, sucking air, and
her eyes seemed fixed. The glow surrounded her, though, and that
stream of fireballs continued. Not as fast as before, true, and
some shot wide of the gateway, streaking trails of flame through
the grass or exploding on the ground beyond, but they still formed
and flew. Elayne took strength, made herself take strength; if
Aviendha could keep on when she looked ready to fall on her face,
she could, too.</p>

<p>At a gallop, the gateway began to dwindle, brown
grass stretching out between them and the opening, and then the
ground was slanting upward. They were climbing the hill! Birgitte
was again the arrow in the bow, all focus, fighting down the agony
in her legs, urging her horses for more speed. All they had to do
was reach the crest, reach the other side.</p>

<p>With a gasp, Aviendha sagged onto her elbows,
bouncing on her saddle like a loose sack; the light of <em>
saidar</em> flickered around her and was gone. &ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; she
panted. &ldquo;I cannot.&rdquo; That was all she could get out. Seanchan
soldiers began leaping into the meadow almost as soon as the hail
of fire ceased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Elayne managed. Her throat was
sand; all the moisture that had been in her now coated her skin and
soaked her clothes. &ldquo;Using an <em>angreal</em> is tiring. You did
well, and they can&rsquo;t catch us now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As if to mock her, a <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> appeared
in the meadow below; even at half a mile there was no mistaking the
two women. The sun, low in the west, still flashed glints off the
<em>a&rsquo;dam</em> linking them. Another pair joined them, then a
third, and a fourth. A fifth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The crest!&rdquo; Birgitte shouted joyfully. &ldquo;We made it!
It&rsquo;s good wine and a well set-up man tonight!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the meadow, a <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> pointed, and
time seemed to slow for Elayne. The glow of the One Power sprang up
around the woman&rsquo;s <em>damane</em>. Elayne could see the weave
forming. She knew what it was. And there was no way to stop it.
&ldquo;Faster!&rdquo; she shouted. The shield struck her. She should have been
too strong for it&mdash;she should have been!&mdash;but exhausted
as she was, barely clinging to <em>saidar</em> as she was, it
sliced between her and the Source. Down in the meadow, the weave
that had been a gateway fell in on itself. Haggard, looking as
though she could not possibly move, Aviendha hurled herself from
her saddle at Elayne, carrying them both off. Elayne had just time
to see the far slope of the hill below her as she fell.</p>

<p>The air turned white, blanking her sight. There was
sound&mdash;she knew there was sound, a great roar&mdash;but it
lay beyond hearing. Something struck her, as if she had fallen from
a rooftop onto hard pavement, from a tower top.</p>

<p>Her eyes opened, staring at the sky. The sky looked,
strange somehow, blurry. For a moment she could not move, and when
she did, she gasped. She hurt everywhere. Oh, Light, she hurt!
Slowly she raised a hand to her face; her fingers came away red.
Blood. The others. She had to help the others. She could feel
Birgitte, feel pain as bad as what gripped her, but at least
Birgitte was alive. And determined, and angry apparently; she could
not be injured too badly. Aviendha.</p>

<p>With a sob, Elayne rolled over, then pushed up to
hands and knees, her head spinning, agony stabbing her side.
Vaguely she recalled that moving with even one broken rib could be
dangerous, but the thought was as hazy as the hillside. Thinking
seemed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;difficult. Blinking appeared to help her sight,
though. Some. She was almost to the bottom of the hill! High above,
a haze of smoke rose from the meadow beyond. Unimportant, now. Not
important at all.</p>

<p>Thirty paces up the slope, Aviendha was on her hands
and knees, too, almost falling over when she raised a hand to wipe
away blood that poured down her face, but searching anxiously. Her
gaze fell on Elayne, and she froze, staring. Elayne wondered how
bad she looked. Surely no worse than Aviendha herself; half of the
other woman&rsquo;s skirt was gone, her bodice torn nearly off, and
everywhere skin showed, there seemed to be blood.</p>

<p>Elayne crawled to her. With her head, it seemed much
easier than trying to stand and walk. As she came close, Aviendha
gave a relieved gasp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are all right,&rdquo; she said, touching bloody
fingers to Elayne&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;I was so afraid. So afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne blinked in surprise. What she could see of
herself appeared in every bit as bad shape as Aviendha. Her own
skirts remained intact, but half of her bodice was ripped away
entirely, and she seemed to be bleeding from two dozen gashes. Then
it struck her. She had not been burned out. She shivered at the
thought. &ldquo;We are both all right,&rdquo; she said softly.</p>

<p>Well off to one side, Birgitte wiped her belt knife
on the mane of Aviendha&rsquo;s gelding and straightened from the
still horse. Her right arm dangled, her coat was gone, along with
one boot, and the rest of her garments torn; as much blood stained
her skin and clothes as either of theirs. The crossbow bolt
standing out from her thigh seemed to be the worst of her injuries,
but the rest certainly added up to as much again. &ldquo;His back was
broken,&rdquo; she said, gesturing to the horse at her feet. &ldquo;Mine&rsquo;s
well, I think, but the last I saw of him, he was running fit to win
the Wreath of Megairil. I always thought he had a turn of speed.
Lioness.&rdquo; She shrugged, and winced. &ldquo;Elayne, Lioness was dead when
I found her. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are alive,&rdquo; Elayne said firmly, &ldquo;and that is what
counts.&rdquo; She would weep for Lioness later. The smoke above the
hilltop was not thick, but it rose over a wide area. &ldquo;I want to see
exactly what it was that I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It took clinging to one another for all three of them
to stand, and laboring up the hillside was an effort of panting and
groans, even from Aviendha. They sounded as though they had been
thrashed within an inch of their lives&mdash;which Elayne supposed
they had been&mdash;and looked as though they had wallowed in a
butcher&rsquo;s shambles. Aviendha still carried the <em>
angreal</em> tight in her fist, but even if she or Elayne had
possessed more than their small Talent with Healing, neither could
have managed to embrace the Source, much less channel. At the top
of the hill, they stood leaning on each other and stared at
devastation.</p>

<p>Fire ringed the meadow, but the heart of it was
blackened, smoldering and swept clear even of boulders. Half the
trees on the surrounding slopes were broken or leaning away from
the meadow. Hawks began to appear, riding the hot air rising from
the fire; hawks often hunted so, looking for small animals chased
into the open by the flames. Of the Seanchan there was no sign.
Elayne wished there were bodies, so she could be certain they were
all dead. Especially all of the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>. Gazing down
at the burned, smoking ground, though, she was suddenly glad there
was no evidence. It had been a terrible way to die. <em>The Light
have mercy on their souls</em>, she thought. <em>On all of their
souls</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said aloud, &ldquo;I did not do as well as you,
Aviendha, but I suppose it worked out for the best, considering. I
will try to do better next time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha glanced at her sideways. There was a gash on
her cheek, and another across her forehead, as well as a long one
laying open her scalp. &ldquo;You did much better than I, for a first
try. I was given a simple knot tied in a flow of Wind the first
time. It took me fifty tries to unweave even that without having a
clap of thunder in my face, or a blow that made my ears ring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I should have started with something
simpler,&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;I have a habit of leaping in over my head.&rdquo;
Over her head? She had leaped before looking to see whether there
was <em>water</em>! She stifled a chuckle, but not before it sent a
stab through her side. So instead of chuckling, she moaned through
her teeth. She thought some of them might be loose. &ldquo;At least
we&rsquo;ve found a new weapon. Perhaps I should not be happy about
that, but with the Seanchan back again, I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not understand, Elayne.&rdquo; Aviendha gestured
toward the center of the meadow, where the gateway had been. &ldquo;That
could have been no more than a flash of light, or even less. You
cannot tell until it happens. Is a flash of light worth the risk of
burning out yourself and every woman closer to you than a hundred
paces or more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne stared at her. She had stayed, knowing that?
To risk your life was one thing, but to risk losing the ability to
channel&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;I want us to adopt each other as first-sisters,
Aviendha. As soon as we can find Wise Ones.&rdquo; What they were to do
about Rand, she could not imagine. The very idea that they would
<em>both</em> marry him&mdash;and Min, too!&mdash;was worse than
ridiculous. But of this, she was sure. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to know
any more about you. I want to be your sister.&rdquo; Gently, she kissed
Aviendha&rsquo;s bloodstained cheek.</p>

<p>She had only thought Aviendha blushed fiercely
before. Even Aiel lovers did not kiss where anyone could see. Fiery
sunsets paled beside Aviendha&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I want you for my
sister, too,&rdquo; she mumbled. Swallowing hard&mdash;and eyeing
Birgitte, who was pretending to ignore them&mdash;she leaned over
and quickly pressed her lips to Elayne&rsquo;s cheek. Elayne loved
her as much for that gesture as for the rest.</p>

<p>Birgitte had been gazing behind them, over her
shoulder, and perhaps she had not been pretending after all,
because she suddenly said, &ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s coming. Lan and Nynaeve,
unless I miss my guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Awkwardly, they turned, hobbling and stumbling and
groaning. It seemed quite ludicrous; heroes in stories never got
hurt so they could barely stand. In the distance to the north, two
riders appeared briefly through the trees. Briefly, but long enough
to make out a tall man on a tall horse, galloping hard, and a woman
on a shorter animal running just as hard at his side. Gingerly, the
three of them sat down to wait. That was another thing heroes in
stories never did, Elayne thought with a sigh. She hoped she could
be a queen to make her mother proud, but it was clear that she
would never make a hero.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Chulein moved the reins slightly, and Segani banked
smoothly, turning on a ribbed wing. He was a well-trained <em>
raken</em>, swift and agile, her favorite, though she had to share
flying him. There were always more <em>morat&rsquo;raken</em> than
<em>raken</em>; a fact of life. Down in the farm below, balls of
fire were leaping out of the air apparently, scattering in every
direction. She tried to pay no attention; her job was to watch for
trouble approaching from the area around the farm. At least the
smoke had stopped rising from where Tauan and Macu had died in the
olive grove.</p>

<p>A thousand paces above the ground, she had a very
long view. All the other <em>raken</em> were off scouting the
countryside; any woman who ran would be marked for checking, to see
whether she was one of those who had caused all the excitement,
though truth for sure, anyone in these lands who saw a <em>
raken</em> in the air likely would run. All Chulein had to do was
watch for approaching trouble here. She wished she did not feel an
itch between her shoulder blades; it always meant trouble <em>
was</em> on the way. The wind of Segani&rsquo;s flight was not bad
at this speed, but she drew the drawstring of her waxed linen hood
tighter under her chin, tested the leather safety straps that held
her in the saddle, adjusted her crystal goggles, snugged her
gauntlets.</p>

<p>Over a hundred Fists of Heaven were on the ground
already, and more importantly, six <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> with <em>
damane</em> and another dozen carrying shoulder bags full of spare
<em>a&rsquo;dam</em>. The second flight would be lifting from the
hills to the south with reinforcements. Better if more had come in
the first strike, but there were few enough <em>to&rsquo;raken</em>
with the Hailene, and strong rumor had it that many of those had
been given the task of ferrying the High Lady Suroth and her entire
entourage down from Amadicia. Bad to think ill of the Blood, yet
she wished more <em>to&rsquo;raken</em> had been sent to Ebou Dar.
No <em>morat&rsquo;raken</em> could think well of the huge, ungainly
<em>to&rsquo;raken</em>, fit only to carry burdens, but they could
have put more Fists of Heaven on the ground faster, more <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rumor says there are hundreds of <em>
marath&rsquo;damane</em> down there,&rdquo; Eliya said loudly against her
back. In the sky, you had to speak loudly, over the rush of wind.
&ldquo;Do you know what I&rsquo;m going to do with my share of the taking
gold? Buy an inn. This Ebou Dar looks a likely place, what I saw of
it. Maybe I&rsquo;ll even find a husband. Have children. What do you
think of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chulein grinned behind her wind-scarf. Every flier
talked of buying an inn&mdash;or a tavern, sometimes a farm&mdash;yet who could leave the sky? She patted the base of Segani&rsquo;s
long, leathery neck.</p>

<p>Every woman flier&mdash;three in four were women&mdash;talked of a husband and children, but children meant an end
to flying, too. More women left the Fists of Heaven in a month than
left the sky in half a year.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you should keep your eyes open,&rdquo; she said.
But there was no harm in a little talk. She could have seen a child
move in the olive groves below, much more anything that might
threaten Fists of Heaven. The most lightly armored of soldiers,
they were about as hard as the Deathwatch Guard; some said harder.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll use my share to buy a <em>damane</em> and hire a <em>
sul&rsquo;dam</em>.&rdquo; If there were half as many <em>
marath&rsquo;damane</em> down there as rumor claimed, her share
would buy two <em>damane</em>. Three! &ldquo;A <em>damane</em> trained to
make Sky Lights. When I leave the sky, I&rsquo;ll be as rich as one
of the Blood.&rdquo; They had something called &ldquo;fireworks&rdquo; here&mdash;she had seen some fellows vainly trying to interest the Blood in
Tanchico&mdash;but who would watch such a pitiful thing compared
to the Sky Lights? Those fellows had been bundled out and dumped in
the road outside the city.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The farm!&rdquo; Eliya shouted, and suddenly something hit
Segani hard, harder than the worst storm gust Chulein had ever
felt, tumbling him wing over wing.</p>

<p>Down the <em>raken</em> plunged, screaming his
raucous cry, spinning so fast that Chulein was pulled tight against
her safety straps. She left her hands on her thighs, tensed on the
reins but still. Segani had to pull out of this himself; any twitch
on the reins would only hinder him. Rolling like a gambling wheel,
they fell. <em>Morat&rsquo;raken</em> were taught not to watch the
ground if a <em>raken</em> fell, whatever the reason, but she could
not help estimating her height every time a whiplike tumble bought
the ground into sight. Eight hundred paces. Six hundred. Four. Two.
The Light illumine her soul, and the infinite mercy of the Creator
protect her from&mdash;</p>

<p>With a snap of his broad wings that jerked her
sideways and rattled her teeth, Segani leveled out, the tips of his
pinons brushing treetops as they swept down. With a calmness born
of hard training, she checked the motion of his wings for strain.
Nothing, but she would have a <em>der&rsquo;morat&rsquo;raken</em>
examine him thoroughly anyway. A tiny thing that might slip by her
eyes would not escape a master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems we&rsquo;ve escaped the Lady of the Shadows
one more time, Eliya.&rdquo; Turning to look over her shoulder, she let
her words tail off. A length of broken safety strap trailed back
from the empty seat behind her. Every flier knew that the Lady
waited at the bottom of the long fall, but knowing never made
seeing easier.</p>

<p>Offering a quick prayer for the dead, she firmly
pushed herself back to duty and urged Segani to climb. A slow,
spiraling climb, in case of some hidden strain, but as quick as she
thought safe. Maybe a little quicker than safe. Smoke rising from
beyond the knobby hill ahead made her frown, but what she saw as
she cleared the crest dried her mouth. Her hands stilled on the
reins, and Segani continued to climb on powerful sweeps of his

<p>The farm was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;gone. Foundations scoured clean of
the white buildings that had stood on them, the big structures
built into a hillside smashed heaps of rubble. Gone. Everything was
blackened and burned. Fire raged through the undergrowth on the
slopes and made fans a hundred paces long into the olive groves and
the forest, stretching from the spaces between the hills. Beyond
lay broken trees for another hundred or more, all leaning away from
the farm. She had never seen anything like it. Nothing could be
alive down there. Nothing could have lived through that. Whatever
it had been.</p>

<p>Quickly she came to herself and turned Segani south.
In the distance she could make out <em>to&rsquo;raken</em>, each one
crowded with a dozen Fists of Heaven over this short distance,
Fists of Heaven and <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>, coming too late. She
began composing her report in her head; there was certainly no one
else to make one. Everyone said this was a land full of <em>
marath&rsquo;damane</em> waiting to be collared, but with this new
weapon, these women who called themselves Aes Sedai were a true
danger. Something had to be done about them, something decisive.
Perhaps, if the High Lady Suroth was on her way to Ebou Dar, she
would see the need, too.</p>
