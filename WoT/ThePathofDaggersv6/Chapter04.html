<h4><em>A Quiet Place</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
Kin&rsquo;s farm lay in a broad hollow surrounded
by three low hills, a sprawling affair of more than a dozen large,
white-plastered buildings with flat roofs, gleaming in the sun.
Four great barns were built right into the slope of the highest
hill, a flat-topped thing with one side that fell away in steep
cliffs beyond the barns. A few tall trees that had not lost all of
their leaves provided a modicum of shade in the farmyard. To the
north and east, olive groves marched away and even up the sides of
the hills. A sort of slow bustle enveloped the farm, with easily
over a hundred people in evidence despite the afternoon heat,
carrying on all the everyday tasks but none quickly.</p>

<p>It might almost have passed for a small village
instead of a farm, except that there was not a man or a child to be
seen. Elayne did not expect any. This was a waypoint for Kinswomen
passing through Ebou Dar to elsewhere, so there would not be too
many in the city itself at one time, but that was a secret matter,
as secret as the Kin themselves. Publicly this farm was known for
two hundred miles or more as a retreat for women, a place for
contemplation and escape from the cares of the world for a time, a
few days, a week, sometimes longer. Elayne could almost feel
serenity in the air. She might have regretted bringing the world
into this quiet place, except that she also brought new hope.</p>

<p>The first appearance of the horses coming around the
leaning hill produced far less stir than she expected. A number of
the women stopped to watch, but no more than that. Their clothing
varied widely&mdash;Elayne even saw a sheen of silk here and there&mdash;but some carried baskets and others buckets, or great white
bundles of what had to be wash. One held a pair of bound ducks by
the feet in either hand. Noblewoman and craftswoman, farmer and
beggar, all were equally welcome here, but everyone did a share of
the work during her stay. Aviendha touched Elayne&rsquo;s arm, then
pointed to the top of one of the hills, a thing like an inverted
funnel skewed to one side. Elayne added a hand to the shade of her
hat and after a moment saw movement. Small wonder no one was
surprised. Lookouts up there could see anyone coming from a long
way.</p>

<p>A middling woman walked out to meet them short of the
farm buildings. Her dress was in the Ebou Dari style, with a deep
narrow neckline, but her dark skirts and brightly colored
petticoats were short enough that she did not need to hold them up
out of the dust. She did not wear a marriage knife; the Kin&rsquo;s
rules prohibited marriage. The Kin had too many secrets to
keep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Alise,&rdquo; Reanne murmured, reining in
between Nynaeve and Elayne. &ldquo;She runs the farm this turn.
She&rsquo;s very intelligent.&rdquo; Almost like an afterthought, she
added, even more quietly, &ldquo;Alise does not suffer fools gladly.&rdquo; As
Alise approached, Reanne drew herself up in her saddle, squaring
her shoulders as though for an ordeal.</p>

<p>Middling was exactly how Elayne thought of Alise, not
someone to give Reanne pause, certainly, even had she not been the
Eldest of the Knitting Circle. Straight-backed, Alise appeared to
be somewhere in her middle years, neither slender nor stout, tall
nor short, a little gray flecking dark brown hair that was tied
back with a piece of ribbon, but in a very practical manner. Her
face was unremarkable, though pleasant enough, a mild face, perhaps
a little long in the jaw. When she saw Reanne, she gave a fleeting
look of surprise, then smiled. That smile transformed everything.
It did not make her beautiful or even pretty, but Elayne felt
warmed by it, comforted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hardly expected to see you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Reanne,&rdquo; Alise
said, barely hesitating over the name. Obviously she was unsure
whether to use Reanne&rsquo;s rightful title in front of Nynaeve and
Elayne and Aviendha. She studied them with quick glances as she
spoke. There seemed to be a bit of Tarabon in her voice. &ldquo;Berowin
brought word of trouble in the city, of course, but I didn&rsquo;t
think it was so bad you would have to leave. Who are all these&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Her words trailed off, and her eyes widened, staring beyond
them.</p>

<p>Elayne glanced back, nearly loosing a few of the
choice phrases she had picked up in various places, most recently
from Mat Cauthon. She did not understand all of them, not most of
them really&mdash;nobody ever wanted to explain what they meant
exactly&mdash;but they did have a way of relieving emotion. The
Warders had doffed their color-shifting cloaks, and the sisters had
drawn up the hoods of their dust-cloaks as instructed, even
Sareitha, who had no need to hide her youthful face, but Careane
had not pulled hers forward far enough. It simply framed her
ageless features. Not everyone would know what they were seeing,
yet anyone who had been in the Tower surely would. Careane jerked
the hood forward at Elayne&rsquo;s glare, but the damage was
done.</p>

<p>Others at the farm beside Alise possessed sharp eyes.
&ldquo;Aes Sedai!&rdquo; a woman howled in tones suitable for announcing the
end of the world. Perhaps she was, for her world. Shrieks spread
like dust blown on the wind, and that quickly, the farm became a
kicked anthill. Here and there a woman simply fainted dead away,
but most ran wildly, screaming, dropping what they carried, bumping
into one another, falling down and scrambling up to run on.
Flapping ducks and chickens and short-horned black goats darted
wildly to avoid being trampled. In the midst of it all, some women
stood gaping, plainly those who had come to the retreat with no
knowledge of the Kin, though a few of them began to move hurriedly,
too, caught up in the frenzy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light!&rdquo; Nynaeve barked, yanking her braid. &ldquo;Some of
them are running into the olive groves! Stop them! The last thing
we want is a panic! Send the Warders! Quick, quick!&rdquo; Lan raised a
questioning eyebrow, but she waved a peremptory hand at him.
&ldquo;Quick! Before they <em>all</em> run away!&rdquo; With a nod that seemed
to begin as a shake of his head, he sent Mandarb galloping after
the other men, curving to avoid the spreading pandemonium among the
buildings.</p>

<p>Elayne shrugged at Birgitte, then motioned her to
follow. She agreed with Lan. It seemed a bit late to try stopping a
panic, and Warders on horseback attempting to herd frightened women
probably was not the best way. But she could not see how to change
matters now, and there was no point letting them run off into the
countryside. They would all want to hear the news she and Nynaeve
brought.</p>

<p>Alise gave no sign of running, or even fidgeting. Her
face paled slightly, but she stared up at Reanne with a steady
gaze. A firm gaze. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;Why, Reanne? I could not
have imagined you doing this! Did they give you bribes? Offer
immunity? Will they let you walk free while we pay the price? They
probably won&rsquo;t allow it, but I vow I&rsquo;ll ask them to let
me call you down. Yes, you! The rules apply even to you, <em>
Eldest</em>! If I can find a way to manage it, I vow you won&rsquo;t
walk away from this smiling!&rdquo; A very firm gaze. Steely, in
fact.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t what you think,&rdquo; Reanne said
hurriedly, dismounting and dropping her reins. She caught both of
Alise&rsquo;s hands in hers despite the other woman&rsquo;s efforts
to free them. &ldquo;Oh, I did not want it to be like this. They know,
Alise. About the Kin. The Tower has <em>always</em> known.
Everything. Almost everything. But that isn&rsquo;t what is
important.&rdquo; Alise&rsquo;s eyebrows tried to climb onto her scalp at
that, but Reanne rushed on, beaming eagerly from under her large
straw hat. &ldquo;We can go back, Alise. We can try again. They <em>
said</em> we can.&rdquo; The farm buildings seemed to be emptying as
well, women rushing out to learn what the commotion was, then
joining the flight without a pause for more than hiking skirts.
Shouts from the olive groves said the Warders were at work, but not
how much they were achieving. Perhaps not a great deal. Elayne
sensed growing frustration from Birgitte, and irritation. Reanne
eyed the turmoil and sighed. &ldquo;We must gather them in, Alise. We can
go back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very well for you and some of the
others,&rdquo; Alise said doubtfully. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s true. What about the
rest of us? The Tower would not have let me stay as long as I did
had I been quicker to learn.&rdquo; She darted a frown at the now
well-hooded sisters, and the stare she returned to Reanne held no
little anger. &ldquo;What would we go back <em>for</em>? To be told again
we aren&rsquo;t strong enough and be sent on our way? Or will they
just keep us as novices the rest of our lives? Some might accept
that, but I won&rsquo;t. What for, Reanne? What for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve climbed down, tugging her mare forward at the
end of her reins, and Elayne imitated her, though leading Lioness
more easily. &ldquo;To be part of the Tower, if that&rsquo;s what you
wish,&rdquo; Nynaeve said impatiently before even reaching the two
Kinswomen. &ldquo;Maybe to be Aes Sedai. Myself, I don&rsquo;t know why
you have to be a certain strength, if you can pass the fool tests.
Or don&rsquo;t go back; run away, for all I care. Once I&rsquo;m done
here, anyway.&rdquo; Planting her feet, she pulled off her hat and
planted her fists on her hips. &ldquo;This is wasting time, Reanne, and
we have work to do. Are you sure there&rsquo;s anybody here we can
use? Speak up. If you&rsquo;re not sure, then we might as well get
on with it. The hurry might be out of the way, but now we have the
thing, I&rsquo;d as soon it was over and done with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When she and Elayne were introduced as Aes Sedai, the
Aes Sedai who had given the promises, Alise made a choked sound and
began smoothing her woolen skirts as though her hands wanted to
latch on to Reanne&rsquo;s throat. Her mouth opened angrily&mdash;then snapped shut without a sound when Merilille joined them. That
stern gaze did not fade completely, but it became mixed with a
touch of wonder. And more than a touch of wariness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve Sedai,&rdquo; Merilille said calmly, &ldquo;the
Atha&rsquo;an Miere are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;impatient&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to be off their
horses. I think some may ask for Healing.&rdquo; A brief smile flickered
across her lips.</p>

<p>That settled that question, though Nynaeve grumbled
extravagantly about what she was going to do to the next person who
doubted her. Elayne might have said a few choice words herself, but
the truth was, Nynaeve looked more than a little silly carrying on
that way with Merilille and Reanne both waiting attentively for her
to finish and Alise staring at all three. That settled it, or
perhaps it was the Windfinders, afoot and pulling their horses
behind them. Every shred of grace had vanished during the ride, worn
away by hard saddles&mdash;their legs seemed as stiff as their
faces&mdash;yet no one could mistake them for anything but who
they were.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there are twenty Sea Folk this far from the sea,&rdquo;
Alise muttered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll believe anything.&rdquo; Nynaeve snorted but
said nothing, for which Elayne was grateful. The woman seemed to be
having a hard enough time accepting even with Merilille naming them
Aes Sedai. Neither tirade nor tantrum would help.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Heal them,&rdquo; Nynaeve told Merilille. Their eyes
went to the hobbling women together, and Nynaeve added, &ldquo;If they
ask. Politely.&rdquo; Merilille smiled again, but Nynaeve had already
abandoned the Sea Folk and gone back to frowning at the now all but
empty farm. A few goats still trotted around a farmyard littered
with dropped wash and rakes and brooms, spilled buckets and
baskets, not to mention the crumpled forms of Kinswomen who had
fainted, and a handful of chickens had gone back to scratching and
pecking, but the only conscious women still in sight among the farm
buildings were plainly not of the Kin. Some wore embroidered linen
or silk and some rough country woolens, yet the fact that they had
not run spoke that much of them. Reanne said that at any given time
as many as half those at the farm might fall into that group. Most
appeared stunned.</p>

<p>Despite her grumbling, Nynaeve wasted no time taking
charge of Alise. Or perhaps Alise took charge of Nynaeve. It was
difficult to tell, since the Kinswoman showed little of the
deference toward Aes Sedai that the Knitting Circle did. Perhaps
she was still just too numbed by the sudden turn of events. In any
case, they moved off together, Nynaeve leading her mare and
gesturing with the hat in her other hand, instructing Alise on how
to bring in the scattered women and what to do with them once they
were collected. Reanne had been sure that at least one woman strong
enough to join the circle was there, Garenia Rosoinde, and possibly
two more. In truth, Elayne was hoping they had all gone. Alise
alternated between nodding and giving Nynaeve very level looks that
Nynaeve seemed not to notice.</p>

<p>Now, in the wait while the gathering was done, seemed
a good time to do a bit more searching through the panniers, but
when Elayne turned toward the packhorses, which were just beginning
to be lead toward the farm buildings, she noticed the Knitting
Circle, Reanne and the whole lot of them, making their own way into
the farm on foot, some hurrying toward women lying on the ground,
others toward those standing about gaping. The whole lot of them,
and no sign of Ispan. It took only a glance to find her, though.
Between Adeleas and Vandene, each holding an arm as they
half-dragged her along, their dust-cloaks streaming behind.</p>

<p>The white-haired sisters were linked, the glow of
<em>saidar</em> somehow encompassing them both without including
Ispan. There was no way to tell which led the small circle and held
the shield on the Darkfriend, but not even one of the Forsaken
could have broken it. They stopped to speak to a stout woman in
plain brown wool, who gaped at the leather sack covering
Ispan&rsquo;s head but still curtsied and pointed toward one of the
white-plastered buildings.</p>

<p>Elayne exchanged angry glances with Aviendha. Well,
hers was angry, anyway. Sometimes Aviendha gave away no more than a
stone. Handing their horses over to two of the palace stablemen,
they hurried after the three. Some of the women who were not of the
Kin tried to question them about what was happening, a few in
rather overbearing fashion, but Elayne gave them short shrift,
leaving behind a wake of indignant sniffs and snorts. Oh, what she
would not give to have the ageless face already! That tweaked a
thread in the back of her thoughts, but it vanished as soon as she
tried to examine it.</p>

<p>When she pushed open the plain wooden door where the
trio had vanished, Adeleas and Vandene had Ispan seated in a
ladder-back chair with her head bare, the sack lying atop a narrow
trestle table with their linen cloaks. The room possessed only one
window, set in the ceiling, but with the sun still high it let in a
good light. Shelves lined the walls, stacked with large copper pots
and big white bowls. By the smell of bread baking, the only other
door led into a kitchen.</p>

<p>Vandene looked around sharply at the sound of the
door, but seeing them, she smoothed her face to a total lack of
expression. &ldquo;Sumeko said the herbs Nynaeve gave her were wearing
off,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and it seemed best to question her a little before
fuzzing her brain again. We do seem to have time, now. It would be
good to know what the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the Black Ajah,&rdquo; her mouth twisted in
distaste, &ldquo;was up to in Ebou Dar. And what they know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt they are aware of this farm, since we were
not,&rdquo; Adeleas said, tapping a finger thoughtfully on her lips as
she studied the woman in the chair, &ldquo;but it is better to be sure
than to weep later, as our father used to say.&rdquo; She might have been
examining an animal she had never seen before, a creature she could
not fathom existing.</p>

<p>Ispan&rsquo;s lip curled. Sweat rolled down her
bruised face, and her dark, beaded braids were disheveled and her
clothing all disarrayed, but despite bleary eyes, she was not
nearly so woozy as she had been. &ldquo;The Black Ajah, it is a fable,
and a filthy one,&rdquo; she sneered, a trifle hoarsely. It must have
been very hot inside that leather sack, and she had had no water
since leaving the Tarasin Palace. &ldquo;Me, I am surprised that you will
give it voice. And to cast the charge on me! What I have done, I
have done on the orders of the Amyrlin Seat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Elaida?</em>&rdquo; Elayne spat incredulously. &ldquo;You
have the nerve to claim that <em>Elaida</em> ordered you to murder
sisters and steal from the Tower? <em>Elaida</em> ordered what you
did in Tear and Tanchico? Or do you mean Siuan? Your lies are
pathetic! You&rsquo;ve forsaken the Three Oaths, somehow, and that
names you Black Ajah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not have to answer the questions from you,&rdquo;
Ispan said sullenly, hunching her shoulders. &ldquo;You are rebels
against the lawful Amyrlin Seat. You will be punished, perhaps
stilled. Especially if you harm me. I serve the true Amyrlin Seat,
and you will be punished severely if you harm me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will answer any questions my near-sister asks.&rdquo;
Aviendha tested her belt knife on a thumbnail, but her eyes were on
Ispan&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Wetlanders fear pain. They do not know how to
embrace it, accept it. You will answer as you are asked.&rdquo; She did
not glare or snarl, she just spoke, but Ispan shrank back in the
chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear that is proscribed, even were she not an
initiate of the Tower,&rdquo; Adeleas said. &ldquo;We are forbidden to shed
blood in questioning, or to allow others to do so in our name.&rdquo; She
sounded reluctant, though whether over the prohibition or over
admitting that Ispan was an initiate, Elayne could not say. She
herself had not really considered that Ispan might still be
considered one. There was a saying that no woman was finished with
the Tower until it was finished with her, but truthfully, once the
White Tower touched you, it never was finished.</p>

<p>Her brow furrowed as she studied the Black sister, so
bedraggled and still so sure of herself. Ispan sat up a little
straighter, and darted glances full of amused contempt at Aviendha&mdash;and Elayne. She had not been so poised earlier, when she
thought it was Nynaeve and Elayne alone who had her; regained
composure had come with remembering that there were older sisters
present. Sisters who would hold White Tower law as part of
themselves. That law forbade not only shedding blood, but breaking
bones and a number of other things that any Whitecloak Questioner
would be more than ready to do. Before any session began, Healing
had to be given, and if the questioning started after sunrise, it
had to end before sundown; if after sunset, then before sunrise.
The law was even more restrictive when it came to initiates of the
Tower, the sisters and Accepted and novices, banning the use of
<em>saidar</em> in questioning, punishment, or penance. Oh, a
sister might flick a novice&rsquo;s ear with the Power if she was
exasperated, or even give her a swat on the bottom, but not very
much more. Ispan smiled at her. Smiled! Elayne took a deep
breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Adeleas, Vandene, I want you to leave Aviendha and
me alone with Ispan.&rdquo; Her stomach tried to tie itself into a knot.
There had to be a way to press the woman sufficiently to learn what
was needed without breaking Tower law. But how? People who were to
be questioned by the Tower usually began talking before a finger
was laid on them&mdash;everyone <em>knew</em> that no one held out
against the Tower; <em>no</em> one!&mdash;but they were very
seldom initiates. She could hear another voice, not Lini&rsquo;s
this time, but her mother&rsquo;s. <em>What you order done, you must
be willing to do with your own hand. As a queen, what you order
done, you</em> have <em>done</em>. If she did break the law&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Her mother&rsquo;s voice again. <em>Even a queen cannot be above the
law, or there is no la</em>w. And Lini&rsquo;s. <em>You can do
whatever you wish, child. So long as you&rsquo;re willing to pay the
price</em>. She dragged her hat off without untying the ribbons.
Keeping her voice steady took an effort. &ldquo;When we are&mdash;when
we are done talking with her, you can take her back to the Knitting
Circle.&rdquo; Afterward, she would submit herself to Merilille. Any five
sisters could sit in judgment to set a penance, if they were
asked.</p>

<p>Ispan&rsquo;s head swung, swollen eyes going from
Elayne to Aviendha and back, slowly widening until the whites
showed all the around. She was not so sure of herself now.</p>

<p>Silent glances passed between Vandene and Adeleas, in
the manner of people who had spent so much time together they
hardly needed to speak aloud any longer; then Vandene took Elayne
and Aviendha each by an arm. &ldquo;If I may speak with you outside a
moment,&rdquo; she murmured. It sounded a suggestion, but she was already
urging them to the door.</p>

<p>Outside in the farmyard, perhaps two dozen or so
Kinswomen were huddled together like sheep. Not all wore Ebou Dari
clothes, but two had the red belts of Wise Women, and Elayne
recognized Berowin, a stout little woman who normally showed a
pride far greater than her strength in the Power. Not now. Like the
rest, her face was frightened, her eyes darting, despite the entire
Knitting Circle surrounding them and talking urgently. Down the
way, Nynaeve and Alise were trying to herd perhaps twice as many
women inside one of the larger buildings. &ldquo;Trying&rdquo; did seem to be
the word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;don&rsquo;t care <em>what</em> estates you
hold,&rdquo; Nynaeve was shouting at a proud-necked woman in pale green
silk. &ldquo;You get in there and stay in there, out of the way, or
I&rsquo;ll <em>kick</em> you inside!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alise simply seized the green-clad woman by the
scruff of the neck and ran her through the doorway despite voluble
and heated protests. There was a loud squawk like a huge goose
being stepped on, then Alise reappeared, dusting her hands. The
others seemed to give no trouble after that.</p>

<p>Vandene released them, studying their eyes. The glow
still enveloped her, yet Adeleas must have been focusing their
combined flows. Vandene could have maintained the shield, once
woven, without being able to see it, but had she been the one, it
was much likelier that Adeleas would have brought them out. Vandene
could have gone several hundred paces before the link began to
attenuate&mdash;it would not break if she and Adeleas went to
opposite corners of the earth, though it would have been useless
long before that&mdash;but she remained close to the door. She
seemed to sort words in her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always thought it best if women with
experience handle this sort of thing,&rdquo; she said finally. &ldquo;The young
can easily be caught up in hot blood. Then they do too much. Or
sometimes, they realize they can&rsquo;t bring themselves to do
enough. Because they haven&rsquo;t really seen enough, yet. Or worst
of all, they find a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;taste for it. Not that I believe either
of you has that flaw.&rdquo; She gave Aviendha a weighing glance without
pausing; Aviendha hastily sheathed her belt knife. &ldquo;Adeleas and I
have seen enough to know why we must do what must be done, and we
left hot blood behind long ago. Perhaps you will leave this to us.
Much better that way, all around.&rdquo; Vandene seemed to take the
recommendation as accepted. She nodded and turned back toward the
door.</p>

<p>No sooner had she disappeared behind it, than Elayne
felt the use of the Power within, a weave that must have blanketed
the room inside. A ward against eavesdropping, certainly. They
would not want stray ears to catch whatever Ispan said. Then
another use hit her, and suddenly the silence from within was more
ominous than any shrieks that ward would contain.</p>

<p>She crushed her hat back onto her head. The heat she
could not feel, but the sun&rsquo;s glare suddenly made her queasy.
&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll help me look over what the packhorses are
carrying,&rdquo; she said breathily. She had not ordered it done&mdash;whatever <em>it</em> was&mdash;but that did not seem to change
anything. Aviendha nodded with surprising quickness; she seemed to
want to be away from that silence, too.</p>

<p>The Windfinders were waiting not far from where the
servants had the pack animals, waiting impatiently and staring
about imperiously, arms folded beneath their breasts, copying
Renaile. Alise marched up to them, marking Renaile out as the
leader after one sweeping glance. Elayne and Aviendha she
ignored.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; she said in brisk tones that brooked
no argument. &ldquo;The Aes Sedai say you will want to be out of the sun
until matters are more settled.&rdquo; The words &ldquo;Aes Sedai&rdquo; held as much
bitterness as they did the awe Elayne was used to from Kinswomen.
Maybe more. Renaile stiffened, her dark face growing darker, but
Alise plowed on. &ldquo;You wilders can sit out here and sweat if
that&rsquo;s what you want, for all of me. If you <em>can</em> sit.&rdquo;
It was obvious none of the Atha&rsquo;an Miere had received Healing
for their saddle soreness; they stood like women who wanted to
forget they existed below the waist. &ldquo;What you will not do is keep
me waiting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know who I am?&rdquo; Renaile demanded in a tight
fury, but Alise was already walking away and not looking back.
Struggling with herself visibly, Renaile dashed sweat from her
forehead with the back of her hand, then angrily ordered the other
Windfinders to leave the &ldquo;shore-cursed&rdquo; horses and follow her. They
made a spraddle-legged line wobbling along after Alise, everyone
but the two apprentices muttering to herself&mdash;Alise
included.</p>

<p>Instinctively, Elayne began to plan how to smooth
matters over, how to get the Atha&rsquo;an Miere&rsquo;s pains Healed
without them having to ask. Or a sister having to offer too
strenuously; Nynaeve had to be appeased, too, and the other
sisters. To her surprise, she suddenly realized that for once in
her life she had no real desire to smooth anything. Watching the
Windfinders limp toward one of the farm buildings, she decided that
matters were fine just as they were. Aviendha wore a large, open
grin as she watched the Atha&rsquo;an Miere. Elayne snatched the
much smaller smile from her own face and turned to the packhorses.
They did deserve it, though. Not grinning was very hard.</p>

<p>With Aviendha&rsquo;s help, the searching went more
quickly than before, though Aviendha did not recognize what they
were after as quickly as she did. Not a great surprise. A few of
the sisters Elayne had trained showed a greater skill in this than
she did herself, but most came nowhere near. Still, two sets of
hands found more than one, and there was a great deal to be found.
Liveried stablemen and women carried away the rubbish, while a
collection of <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> grew on the broad stone lid
of a square cistern.</p>

<p>Four more horses were unloaded quickly, and they
accumulated a selection that would have caused a celebration,
brought into the Tower. Even with no one studying <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. They took every form imaginable. Cups and
bowls and vases, no two the same size or design or in the same
material. A flat, worm-eaten box, half-falling apart and whatever
had lined it long since gone to dust, held pieces of jewelry&mdash;a necklace and bracelets set with colored stones, a slim
gem-studded belt, several finger rings&mdash;and there were spaces
for more. Every single one was a <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, and
they all matched, meant to be worn together, though Elayne could
not imagine why any woman would want to carry so many about her at
one time. Aviendha found a dagger with gold wire wrapped around a
hilt of rough deerhorn; the blade was dull, and by all evidence,
always had been. She kept turning that over and over in her fingers&mdash;her hands actually began to tremble&mdash;until Elayne took
it away from her and put it with the others on the cistern&rsquo;s
lid. Even then Aviendha stood for a time, looking at it and licking
her lips as though they had gone dry. There were finger rings,
earrings, necklaces, bracelets and buckles, many of very peculiar
pattern indeed. There were statuettes and figures of birds and
animals and people, several knives that did have edges, half a
dozen large medallions in bronze or steel, most worked with strange
patterns and not one carrying an image Elayne could really
understand, a pair of peculiar hats seemingly made of metal, too
ornate and too thin to be helmets, and any number of items she
could not think what to call. A rod, as thick as her wrist, bright
red and smooth and rounded, firm rather than hard for all that it
seemed to be stone; it did not warm slightly in her hand, it almost
felt hot! Not real heat any more than the warmth was real, but
still! What about a set of metal basketwork balls, one inside the
other? Any movement produced a faint musical chime, a different
tone every time, and she had the feeling that no matter how hard
she looked into it, there would always be a still smaller ball
waiting to be discovered. A thing that looked like a
blacksmith&rsquo;s puzzle made of glass? It was heavy enough that
she dropped it, and it broke a chip off the edge of the cistern
cover. A collection to stir amazement in any Aes Sedai. More
important, they found two more <em>angreal</em>. Those Elayne set
very carefully aside, within arm&rsquo;s reach.</p>

<p>One was an odd piece of jewelry, a golden bracelet
attached by four flat chains to finger rings, every bit of it
engraved in an intricate mazelike pattern. That was the stronger of
the two, stronger than the turtle still in her pouch. It was made
for a smaller hand than hers or Aviendha&rsquo;s. Strangely, the
bracelet had a tiny lock, complete with a minuscule, tubular key
dangling from a fine chain that was obviously made to be removed.
Along with the key! The other was a seated woman in age-darkened
ivory, her legs folded in front of her, her exposed knees bare, but
with hair so long and luxuriant she could not have been more
muffled in the heaviest cloak. It was not even as strong as the
turtle, but she found it very appealing. One hand rested on a knee,
palm up and fingers arranged so the thumb touched the tips of the
middle two fingers, while the other hand was lifted, the first two
fingers raised and the others folded. The whole figure carried an
air of supreme dignity, yet the delicately worked face showed
amusement and delight. Maybe it had been made for a particular
woman? It seemed personal, somehow. Perhaps they had done that, in
the Age of Legends. Some <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> were immense,
needing men and horses, or even the Power, to move, but most <em>
angreal</em> were small enough to carry about your person; not all,
but most.</p>

<p>They were tossing back the canvas covers on another
set of wicker panniers when Nynaeve came striding up. The
Atha&rsquo;an Miere began filing out of one of the farm buildings,
no longer limping. Merilille was talking with Renaile, or rather,
the Windfinder was talking and Merilille listening. Elayne wondered
what had happened in there. The slim Gray did not look so satisfied
anymore. The huddle of Kinswomen had grown larger, but even as
Elayne looked up, three more came hesitantly into the farmyard, and
another two stood at the edge of the olive trees, peering about
indecisively. She could sense Birgitte, somewhere out among the
groves and only a little less irritated than earlier.</p>

<p>Nynaeve glanced at the display of <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em> and gave her braid a tug. Her hat had gone
missing somewhere. &ldquo;That can wait,&rdquo; she said, sounding disgusted.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;</p>
