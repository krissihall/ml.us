<h4><em>Heading West</em></h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen
the serving girl came with the bonnets, Elayne
was stretched out on one of the beds in a white silk shift, a damp
cloth over her eyes, and Nynaeve was pretending to mend the hem of
the pale green dress that Elayne had been wearing. As often as not
she stuck her thumb; she would never have admitted it to anyone,
but she was not very good at needlework. She wore her dress, of
course&mdash;maids did not loll about like ladies&mdash;but she
did have her hair hanging loose. Clearly she had no intention of
leaving the room any time soon. She thanked the girl in a whisper,
so as not to wake her lady, and pressed another silver penny on
her, with the repeated injunction that her lady was not to be
disturbed on any account.</p>

<p>As soon as the door clicked shut, Elayne bounded to
her feet and began pulling their bundles out from under the beds.
Nynaeve tossed the silk gown down and twisted her arms behind her
to undo her buttons. In no time at all they were ready, Nynaeve in
green wool, Elayne in blue, with the bundles on their backs.
Nynaeve carried the scrip with her herbs and the money, Elayne the
blanket-wrapped boxes. The deep curving brims of the bonnets hid
their faces so well that Nynaeve thought they could have walked
right by Galad without him knowing them, especially with her hair
down; he would remember the braid. Mistress Jharen, however, might
well stop two strange women coming with fat bundles from
upstairs.</p>

<p>The back stairs ran down the outside of the inn,
narrow stone flights clinging to the wall. Nynaeve felt a moment of
sympathy for Thom and Juilin, hauling the heavy chests up these,
but mainly her attention was on the stableyard and the slate-roofed
stone stable. A yellow dog lay in the shade beneath the coach,
sheltering from the already increasing heat, but all of the grooms
were inside. Now and again she could see movement beyond the open
stable doors, but no one came out; it was shady in there, too.</p>

<p>They trotted quickly across the stableyard to the
alley between the stable and a tall stone fence. A full dung cart,
swarming with flies and scarcely narrower than the alleyway, was
just rumbling by. Nynaeve suspected that the glow of <em>
saidar</em> surrounded Elayne, though she could not see it. She
herself was hoping that the dog did not decide to bark, that no one
came out of the kitchens or the stable. Using the Power was no way
to sneak off quietly, and talking their way clear would leave
traces for Galad to follow.</p>

<p>The rough wooden gate at the end of the alley had
only a lift-latch, and the narrow street beyond, lined with simple
stone houses with more thatched roofs than otherwise, was empty
except for a handful of boys playing some game that seemed to
involve hitting each other with a beanbag. The only adult in sight
was a man feeding a cote of pigeons on a roof opposite, his head
and shoulders up through a trapdoor. Neither he nor the boys more
than glanced at them as they shut the gate and started along the
winding street as if they had every right to be there.</p>

<p>They had walked a good five miles west of Sienda
along the dusty road before Thom and Juilin caught up, Thom driving
what looked like a Tinker&rsquo;s wagon, save that it was all one color,
a drab green, with the paint flaked off in large patches. Nynaeve
was grateful to stuff her bundles under the driver&rsquo;s seat and climb
up beside him, but not so pleased to see Juilin riding Skulker. &ldquo;I
told you not to go back to the inn,&rdquo; she told him, vowing to hit
him with something if he looked at Thom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not go back,&rdquo; he said, unaware that he had
saved himself a sore head. &ldquo;I told the head stableman that my Lady
wanted berries fresh from the country, and Thom and I had to go
fetch them. It&rsquo;s the sort of nonsense that some no&mdash;&rdquo; He cut
off, clearing his throat, as Elayne gave him a cool, expressionless
look from the other side of Thom. Sometimes he forgot that she
really was of royalty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had to have some reason to leave the inn and the
stables,&rdquo; Thom said, whipping up the horses. &ldquo;I suppose you two
said you were taking to your room with fainting spells, or the Lady
Morelin was, but the grooms would have been wondering why we wanted
to wander about in the heat instead of staying in a nice cool
hayloft with no work to do, and maybe a pitcher of ale. Perhaps
we&rsquo;ll not be worth talking about, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne gave Thom, a level look&mdash;no doubt for
the &ldquo;fainting spells&rdquo;&mdash;that he pretended not to see. Or
perhaps did not. Men could be blind when it suited them. Nynaeve
sniffed loudly; he could not miss that. He certainly cracked his
whip over the lead horses sharply enough right after. It was all
just an excuse so they could take turns riding. That was another
thing men did; made excuses to do exactly what they wanted. At
least Elayne was frowning at him slightly instead of simpering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is something else I learned last night,&rdquo; Thom
went on after a time. &ldquo;Pedron Niall is trying to unite the nations
against Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that I don&rsquo;t believe it, Thom,&rdquo; Nynaeve said,
&ldquo;but how could you learn that? I cannot think some Whitecloak
simply told you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too many people were saying the same thing, Nynaeve.
There&rsquo;s a false Dragon in Tear. A false Dragon, and never mind
prophecies about the Stone of Tear falling, or <em>Callandor</em>.
This fellow is dangerous, and the nations ought to unite, the way
they did in the Aiel War. And who better to lead them against this
false Dragon than Pedron Niall? When so many tongues say the same
thing, the same thought exists higher up, and in Amadicia not even
Ailron expresses a thought without asking Niall first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old gleeman always seemed to put together rumors
and whispers and come up with right answers far more often than
not. No, not a gleeman; she had to remember that. Whatever he might
claim, he had been a court-bard, and had probably seen court
intrigue like that in his stories at close hand. Perhaps even
dabbled in it himself, if he had been Morgase&rsquo;s lover. She eyed him
sideways, that leathery face with bushy white eyebrows, those long
mustaches as snowy as the hair on his head. There was no accounting
for some women&rsquo;s taste.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t as if we should not have expected something
like this.&rdquo; She never had. But she should have.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother will support Rand,&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;I know she
will. She knows the Prophecies. And she has as much influence as
Pedron Niall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The slight shake of Thom&rsquo;s head denied the last, at
least. Morgase ruled a wealthy nation, but there were Whitecloaks
in every land and from every land. Nynaeve realized she was going
to have to start paying more attention to Thom. Perhaps he really
did know as much as he pretended. &ldquo;So now you think we should have
let Galad escort us to Caemlyn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne leaned forward to give her a firm look past
Thom. &ldquo;Certainly not. For one thing, there is no way to be sure
that that would be his decision. And for another&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She
straightened, obscuring herself behind the man; she seemed to be
talking to herself, reminding herself. &ldquo;For another, if Mother
really has turned against the Tower, I want to do all my speaking
to her by letter for the time being. She is quite capable of
holding us both in the palace for our own good. She may not be able
to channel, but I do not want to try going against her until I am
full Aes Sedai. If then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A strong woman,&rdquo; Thom said pleasantly. &ldquo;Morgase
would teach you manners quickly enough, Nynaeve.&rdquo; She gave him
another loud sniff&mdash;all that loose hair hanging over her
shoulders was no good for gripping&mdash;but the old fool only
grinned at her.</p>

<p>The sun stood high by the time they reached the
menagerie, still camped exactly where they had left it, in the
clearing by the road. In the still heat, even the oaks looked a bit
wilted. Except for the horses and the great gray boar-horses, the
animals were all back in their cages and the humans were out of
sight, too, no doubt inside the wagons that looked not much
different from theirs. Nynaeve and the others had all climbed down
before Valan Luca appeared, still in that ridiculous red silk
cape.</p>

<p>There were no flowery speeches this time, no
cape-swirling bows. His eyes widened when he recognized Thom and
Juilin, narrowed at the boxlike wagon behind them. He bent to peer
into the deep bonnets, and his smile was not pleasant. &ldquo;So, come
down in the world, have we, my <em>Lady</em> Morelin? Or maybe we
were never up at all. Stole a coach and some clothes, did you?
Well, I would hate to see such a pretty forehead branded. That is
what they do here, in case you don&rsquo;t know, if they do not do worse.
So since it seems you&rsquo;ve been found out&mdash;else why are you
running?&mdash;I would suggest you hurry on as fast as you can. If
you want your bloody penny back, it&rsquo;s somewhere up the road. I
threw it after you, and it can lie there till Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don for
all I care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wanted a patron,&rdquo; Nynaeve said as he was turning
away. &ldquo;We can be your patrons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; he sneered. But he stopped. &ldquo;Even if a few
coins stolen from some lord&rsquo;s purse would help, I will not accept
stolen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will pay your expenses, Master Luca,&rdquo; Elayne
broke in with that coolly arrogant tone of hers, &ldquo;and one hundred
gold marks besides, if we can travel with you to Ghealdan, and if
you agree not to stop until you reach the border.&rdquo; Luca stared at
her, running his tongue over his teeth.</p>

<p>Nynaeve groaned softly; A hundred marks, and gold! A
hundred silver would cover his expenses easily, to Ghealdan and
further, whatever those so-called boar-horses ate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You stole that much?&rdquo; Luca said cautiously. &ldquo;Who is
after you? I won&rsquo;t risk Whitecloaks, or the army. They&rsquo;ll throw us
all into prison, and probably kill the animals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My brother,&rdquo; Elayne replied before Nynaeve could
angrily deny that they had stolen anything. &ldquo;It seems that a
marriage has been arranged while I was away, and my brother was
sent to find me. I have no intention of returning to Cairhien to
marry a man a head shorter, three times my weight and thrice my
age.&rdquo; Her cheeks colored in only a fair imitation of anger; her
throat clearing did it better. &ldquo;My father has dreams of claiming
the Sun Throne if he can gain enough support. My dreams concern a
red-haired Andorman whom I shall wed, whatever my father says. And
that, Master Luca, is as much as you need know of me and more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe you are who you say you are,&rdquo; Luca said
slowly, &ldquo;and maybe you are not. Show me some of this money you
claim you&rsquo;ll give me. Promises buy small cups of wine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Angrily Nynaeve fumbled in her scrip for the fattest
purse and shook it at him, then stuffed it out of sight when he
reached for it. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get what you need as you need it. And the
hundred marks after we reach Ghealdan.&rdquo; A hundred marks gold! They
would have to find a banker and use those letters-of-rights if
Elayne kept on like this.</p>

<p>Luca gave a sour grunt. &ldquo;Whether you stole that or
not, you are still running from somebody. I won&rsquo;t risk my show for
you, whether it&rsquo;s the army or some Cairhienin lord who might come
looking. The lord might be worse, if he thinks I have stolen his
sister. You will have to blend in.&rdquo; That unpleasant smile came on
his face again; he was not going to forget that silver penny.
&ldquo;Everybody who travels with me works at something, and you must as
well, if you mean not to stand out. If the others know you are
paying your way, they will talk, and you would not want that.
Cleaning the cages will do; the horse handlers are always
complaining about having to do that. I&rsquo;ll even find that penny and
give it back to you for pay. Never let it be said Valan Luca is not
generous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve was about to say in no uncertain terms that
they would not pay his way to Ghealdan and work, too, when Thom
laid a hand on her arm. Wordlessly, he bent to scuffle up pebbles
from the ground and began juggling them, six in a circle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have jugglers,&rdquo; Luca said. The six became eight,
then ten, a dozen. &ldquo;You are not bad.&rdquo; The circle became two,
intertwining. Luca rubbed at his chin. &ldquo;Maybe I could find a use
for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can also eat fire,&rdquo; Thom said, letting the stones
fall, &ldquo;perform with knives,&rdquo; he fanned his empty hands, then
seemingly pulled a pebble from Luca&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;and do a few other
things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Luca suppressed his quick grin. &ldquo;That does for you,
but what about the rest?&rdquo; He seemed angry with himself for showing
any enthusiasm or approval.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; Elayne asked, pointing.</p>

<p>The two tall poles Nynaeve had seen being erected now
each had ropes to stay it and a flat platform at its top, with a
rope stretched taut over the thirty paces between. A rope ladder
hung from each platform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is Sedrin&rsquo;s apparatus,&rdquo; Luca replied, then
shook his head. &ldquo;Sedrin the highwalker, dazzling with feats ten
paces up on a thin rope. The fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can walk on it,&rdquo; Elayne told him. Thom reached for
her arm as she took off her bonnet and started forward, but he
subsided at a small shake of her head and a smile.</p>

<p>Luca barred her way, though. &ldquo;Listen, Morelin, or
whatever your name is, your forehead may be too pretty to brand,
but your neck is far too pretty to snap. Sedrin knew what he was
doing, and we finished burying him not more than an hour ago.
That&rsquo;s why everyone is in their wagons. Of course, he drank too
much last night, after we were chased out of Sienda, but I&rsquo;ve seen
him highwalk with a bellyful of brandy. I will tell you what. You
do not have to clean cages. You move into my wagon, and we will
tell everyone you&rsquo;re my ladylove. Just as a tale, of course.&rdquo; His
sly smile said he hoped for more than a tale.</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s smile in return should have raised frost on
him. &ldquo;I do thank you for the offer, Master Luca, but if you will
kindly step aside&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He had to, or else have her walk over
him.</p>

<p>Juilin crumpled that cylindrical hat in his hands,
then crammed it back onto his head as she began climbing one of the
rope ladders, having a little difficulty with her skirts. Nynaeve
knew what the girl was doing. The men should have, and perhaps Thom
did, at least, but he still looked ready to rush over to catch her
if she fell. Luca moved nearer, as though the same thought was in
his head.</p>

<p>For a moment Elayne stood on the platform, smoothing
her dress. The platform looked much smaller, and higher, with her
on it. Then, delicately holding her skirts up as if to keep them
out of mud, she stepped out onto the narrow rope. She might as well have been walking across a street. In a way, Nynaeve knew, she
was. She could not see the glow of <em>saidar</em>, but she knew
that Elayne had woven a path between the two platforms, of Air, no
doubt, turned hard as stone.</p>

<p>Abruptly Elayne put her hands down and turned two
cartwheels, raven-black hair flailing, silk-stockinged legs
flashing in the sun; For the merest instant as she righted herself,
her skirts seemed to brush a flat surface before she snatched them
up again. Two more steps took her to the far platform. &ldquo;Did Master
Sedrin do that, Master Luca?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did somersaults,&rdquo; he shouted back. In a mutter,
he added, &ldquo;But he did not have legs like that. A lady! Hah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not the only one with this skill,&rdquo; Elayne
called. &ldquo;Juilin and&mdash;&rdquo; Nynaeve gave a fierce shake of her head;
channeling or no channeling, her stomach would enjoy that high rope
as much as it did a storm at sea. &ldquo;&mdash;and I have done this many
times. Come on, Juilin. Show him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The thief-catcher looked as if he would rather clean
the cages with his bare hands. The lions&rsquo; cages, with the lions
inside. He closed his eyes, mouth moving in a silent prayer, and
went up the rope ladder in the manner of a man mounting the
scaffold. At the top, he stared from Elayne to the rope with a
fearful concentration. Abruptly, he stepped out, walking rapidly,
arms stretched out to either side, eyes fixed on Elayne and mouth
moving in prayer. She climbed partway down the ladder to make room
for him on the platform, then had to help him find the rungs with
his feet and guide him down.</p>

<p>Thom grinned at her proudly as she came back and took
her bonnet from Nynaeve. Juilin looked as if he had been soaked in
hot water and wrung out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was good,&rdquo; Luca said, rubbing his chin
judiciously. &ldquo;Not as good as Sedrin, mind, but good. I especially
like the way you make it seem so easy, while&mdash;Juilin?&mdash;Juilin pretends to be frightened to death. That will go over very
well.&rdquo; Juilin gave the man a bleak grin that had something of
reaching for knives in it. Luca actually swirled that red cape as
he turned to Nynaeve; he looked very satisfied indeed. &ldquo;And you, my
dear Nana? What surprising talent do you have? Tumbling, perhaps?
Swallowing swords?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dole out the money,&rdquo; she told him, slapping the
scrip. &ldquo;Unless you want to offer <em>me</em> your wagon?&rdquo; She gave
him a smile that wiped his clean away and backed him up two steps
besides.</p>

<p>The shouting had roused people from the wagons, and
everyone gathered around while Luca introduced the troupe&rsquo;s new
performers. He was rather vague about Nynaeve, merely calling what
she did startling; she needed to have a talk with him.</p>

<p>The horse handlers, as Luca called the men who had no
performing talent, were a scruffy, surly lot in general, perhaps
because they were paid less. There were not very many of them,
compared to the number of wagons. In fact, it turned out that
everyone helped with the work, including driving the wagons; there
was not much money in a traveling menagerie, even one like this.
The others were a mixed lot.</p>

<p>Petra, the strongman, was the biggest man Nynaeve had
ever seen. Not tall, but wide; his leather vest showed arms the
size of tree trunks. He was married to Clarine, the plump,
brown-cheeked woman who trained dogs; she looked undersized beside
him. Latelle, who performed with the bears, was a stern-faced,
dark-eyed woman with short black hair and the beginnings of a sneer
permanently on her lips. Aludra, the slender woman who was supposed
to be an Illuminator, might even have been one. She did not wear
her dark hair in Taraboner braids, not surprising given the
feelings in Amadicia, but she had the proper accents, and who could
say what had happened to the Guild of Illuminators? Their chapter
house in Tanchico had certainly closed its doors. The acrobats, on
the other hand, claimed to be brothers named Chavana, but though
they were all short, compact men, they ranged in coloring from
green-eyed Taeric&mdash;his high cheekbones and hooked nose
proclaiming Saldaean blood&mdash;to Barit, who was darker than
Juilin and had Sea Folk tattoos on his hands, though he wore no
earrings or nose-rings.</p>

<p>All but Latelle greeted the newcomers warmly; more
performers meant more people attracted to the show, and more money.
The two jugglers, Ban and Kin&mdash;they really were brothers, it
turned out&mdash;engaged Thom in talk of their trade, once they
found out that he did not work the same way they did. Drawing more
people was one thing, competition another. Yet it was the
pale-haired woman who cared for the boar-horses who attracted
Nynaeve&rsquo;s immediate interest. Cerandin stood stiffly on the fringes
and barely spoke&mdash;Luca claimed she had come from Shara with
the animals&mdash;but her soft, slurred manner of speech made
Nynaeve&rsquo;s ears go to points.</p>

<p>It took a little time to get their wagon in place.
Thom and Juilin seemed more than pleased to have the horse
handlers&rsquo; help with the team, sullenly as it was given, and
invitations were given to Nynaeve and Elayne. Petra and Clarine
asked them to have tea once they were settled. The Chavanas wanted
the two women to have supper with them, and Kin and Ban did, too,
all of which made Latelle&rsquo;s sneer become a scowl. Those invitations
they declined gracefully, Elayne perhaps a bit more so than
Nynaeve; the memory of herself goggling at Galad like a frog-eyed
girl was too fresh for her to be more than minimally polite to any
man. Luca had his own invitation, for Elayne alone, spoken where
Nynaeve could not hear. It earned him a slapped face, and Thom
ostentatiously flashed knives that seemed to roll across his hands
until the man went away growling to himself and rubbing his
cheek.</p>

<p>Leaving Elayne putting her things away in the wagon&mdash;throwing them, really, and muttering to herself furiously&mdash;Nynaeve went off to where the boar-horses were hobbled. The
huge gray animals seemed placid enough, but remembering that hole
in the stone wall of The King&rsquo;s Lancer, she was not too sure about
the leather cords connecting their massive front legs. Cerandin
was scratching the big male with her bronze-hooked goad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are they really called?&rdquo; Diffidently, Nynaeve
patted the male&rsquo;s long nose, or snout, or whatever it was. Those
tusks were as big around as her leg and a good three paces long,
and only a little larger than the female&rsquo;s at that. The snout
snuffled at her skirt and she stepped back hastily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>S&rsquo;redit</em>,&rdquo; the pale-haired woman said. &ldquo;They
are <em>s&rsquo;redit</em>, but Master Luca thought a name more easily
said was better.&rdquo; That drawling accent was unmistakable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are there many <em>s&rsquo;redit</em> in Seanchan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The goad stopped moving for an instant, then resumed
scratching. &ldquo;Seanchan? Where is that? The <em>s&rsquo;redit</em> are from
Shara, as I am. I have never heard of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ve seen Shara, Cerandin, but I doubt it.
You are Seanchan. Unless I miss my guess, you were part of the
invasion on Toman Head, left behind after Falme.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no doubt,&rdquo; Elayne said, stepping up beside
her. &ldquo;We heard Seanchan accents in Falme, Cerandin. We will not
hurt you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was more than Nynaeve was willing to promise;
her memories of the Seanchan were not fond ones. And yet&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>
A Seanchan helped you when you needed it. They are not all evil.
Only most of them</em>.</p>

<p>Cerandin let out a long sigh, and sagged a little. It
was as if a tension so old that she was no longer aware of it had
gone. &ldquo;Very few people I have met know anything approaching the
truth of The Return, or Falme. I have heard a hundred tales, each
more fanciful than the last, but never the truth. As well for me. I
was left behind, and many of the <em>s&rsquo;redit</em>, also. These
three were all I could gather. I do not know what happened to the
rest. The bull is Mer, the cow Sanit, and the calf Nerin. She is
not Sanit&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that what you did?&rdquo; Elayne asked. &ldquo;Train <em>
s&rsquo;redit</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or were you a <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>?&rdquo; Nynaeve added
before the other woman could speak.</p>

<p>Cerandin shook her head. &ldquo;I was tested, as all girls
are, but I could do nothing with the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>. I was glad to
be chosen to work with <em>s&rsquo;redit</em>. They are magnificent
animals. You know a great deal, to know of <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> and
<em>damane</em>. I have encountered no one before who knows of
them.&rdquo; She showed no fear. Or perhaps it had been used up since
finding herself abandoned in a strange land. Then again, maybe she
was lying.</p>

<p>The Seanchan were as bad as Amadicians when it came
to women who could channel, perhaps worse. They did not exile or
kill; they imprisoned and used. By means of a device called an <em>
a&rsquo;dam</em>&mdash;Nynaeve was sure it must be a sort of <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em>&mdash;a woman who had the ability to wield the
One Power could be controlled by another woman, a <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>,
who forced the <em>damane</em> to use her talents for whatever the
Seanchan wanted, even as a weapon. A <em>damane</em> was no better
than an animal, if a well-tended one. And they made <em>damane</em>
of every last woman found with the ability to channel or the spark
born in her; the Seanchan had scoured Toman Head more thoroughly
than the Tower had ever dreamed of. The mere thought of <em>
a&rsquo;dam</em> and <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> and <em>damane</em> made Nynaeve&rsquo;s
stomach chum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know a little,&rdquo; she told Cerandin, &ldquo;but we want
to know more.&rdquo; The Seanchan were gone, driven away by Rand, but
that was not to say they would not return one day. It was a distant
danger beside everything else they had to face, yet just because
you had a thorn in your foot did not mean that a briar scratch on
your arm would not fester eventually. &ldquo;You would do well to answer
our questions truthfully.&rdquo; There would be time on the journey
north.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promise that nothing will happen to you,&rdquo; Elayne
added. &ldquo;I will protect you, if need be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pale-haired woman&rsquo;s eyes shifted from one of them
to the other, and suddenly, to Nynaeve&rsquo;s amazement, she prostrated
herself on the ground in front of Elayne. &ldquo;You are a High Lady of
this land, just as you told Luca. I did not realize. Forgive me,
High Lady. I submit myself to you.&rdquo; And she kissed the ground in
front of Elayne&rsquo;s feet. Elayne&rsquo;s eyes looked ready to leap out of
her face.</p>

<p>Nynaeve was sure she was no better. &ldquo;Get up,&rdquo; she
hissed, looking around frantically to see if anyone was watching.
Luca was&mdash;curse him!&mdash;and Latelle, still wearing that
scowl, but there was nothing to be done. &ldquo;Get up!&rdquo; The woman did
not stir.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand on your feet, Cerandin,&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;No one
requires people to behave that way in this land. Not even a ruler.&rdquo;
As Cerandin scrambled erect, she added, &ldquo;I will teach you the
proper way to behave in return for your answers to our
questions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman bowed, hands on her knees and head down.
&ldquo;Yes, High Lady. It will be as you say. I am yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve sighed heavily. They were going to have a
fine time traveling to Ghealdan.</p>
