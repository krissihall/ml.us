<h4><em>Performances in Samara</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">F</span>or
what seemed the hundredth time, Nynaeve held a
lock of her hair up to look at it and sighed. Thick murmurs of talk
and laughter from hundreds if not thousands of throats, distant
music that was nearly drowned out, drifted in through the wagon
walls. She had not minded spending the parade through the streets
of Samara in the wagon with Elayne&mdash;occasional peeks through
the windows had convinced her that she would just as soon not be
out in those packed crowds, yelling and barely making way for the
wagons&mdash;but every time she looked at the brassy red of her
hair, she wished she had been doing somersaults with the Chavanas
rather than dyeing it.</p>

<p>Carefully not looking at herself, she wrapped up
completely in her plain dark gray shawl, turned, and gave a start
to find Birgitte standing in the doorway. The woman had ridden in
Clarine and Petra&rsquo;s wagon during the parade, with Clarine altering
a spare red dress she had been making for Nynaeve at Luca&rsquo;s
direction; he had given Clarine her instructions before Nynaeve
ever agreed. Birgitte wore it now, her black-dyed braid pulled over
her shoulder so it nestled between her breasts, totally unconscious
of the low square neck. Just looking at her made Nynaeve fold her
shawl tighter; Birgitte could not show a fingernail more of pale
bosom and retain the slightest claim to decency. As it was, such a
claim would be feeble, really quite laughable. Looking at her made
Nynaeve&rsquo;s stomach knot up, but not for reasons of clothes or
skin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are going to wear the dress, why cover up?&rdquo;
Birgitte came inside and closed the door behind her. &ldquo;You are a
woman. Why not be proud of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you think I shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Nynaeve replied
hesitantly, and slowly let the shawl slide down to her elbows,
revealing the twin of the other woman&rsquo;s garment. She felt all but
naked. &ldquo;I only thought&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I thought&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Gripping her silk
skirts hard to keep her hands at her sides, she held her gaze on
the other woman. Even knowing she wore exactly the same herself, it
was easier that way.</p>

<p>Birgitte grimaced. &ldquo;And if I wanted you to lower the
neck another inch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve opened her mouth, face going as scarlet as
the gown, but for a moment nothing came out. When it did, she
sounded as if she were being strangled. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t an inch to
lower it. Look at your own. There isn&rsquo;t a <em>tenth</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Three quick, frowning strides, and Birgitte bent
slightly to put her face right in Nynaeve&rsquo;s. &ldquo;And if I said I
wanted you to rid yourself of that inch?&rdquo; she snarled, showing
teeth. &ldquo;What if I wanted to paint your face, so Luca could have his
fool? What if I stripped you out of it altogether and painted you
from head to toe? A fine target you would make then. Every man
inside fifty miles would come to see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s mouth worked, but this time no sound
emerged at all. She wanted very much to close her eyes; maybe when
she opened them, none of this would be happening.</p>

<p>With a disgusted shake of her head, Birgitte took a
seat on one of the beds, one elbow on her knee and her blue eyes
sharp. &ldquo;This must stop. When I look at you, you flinch. You run
about waiting on me hand and foot. If I glance for a stool, you
fetch one. If I lick my lips, you have a cup of wine in my hands
before I know I am thirsty. You would wash my back and put the
slippers on my feet if I let you. I am neither monster nor invalid
nor child, Nynaeve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am only trying to make up for&mdash;&rdquo; she began
timidly, and jumped when the other woman roared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make up? You are trying to make me less!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. No, it is not that, truly. I am to blame&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You take responsibility for my actions,&rdquo; Birgitte
broke in fiercely. &ldquo;<em>I</em> chose to speak to you in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. <em>I</em> chose to help you. <em>I</em> chose
to track Moghedien. And <em>I</em> chose to take you to see her.
<em>Me!</em> Not you, Nynaeve, me! I was not your puppet, your pack
hound, then, and I will not be now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve swallowed hard and gripped her skirts more
tightly. She had no right to be angry with this woman. No right at
all. But Birgitte had every right. &ldquo;You did what I asked. It is my
fault that you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that you are here. It is all my fault!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have I mentioned fault? I see none. Only men and
dim-witted girls take blame where there is none, and you are
neither.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was my foolish pride that made me think I could
best her again, and my cowardice that let her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that let her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;If I had not been so afraid I could not spit, I might have done
something in time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A coward?&rdquo; Birgitte&rsquo;s eyes widened, openly
incredulous, and scorn touched her voice. &ldquo;You? I thought you had
more sense than to confuse fear with cowardice. You could have fled
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> when Moghedien released you, but you stayed
to fight. No fault or blame to you that you could not.&rdquo; Drawing a
deep breath, she rubbed her forehead for a moment, then leaned
forward intently again. &ldquo;Listen to me close, Nynaeve. I take no
blame for what was done to you. I saw, but I could not twitch. Had
Moghedien tied you into a knot or cored you like an apple, still I
would take no blame. I did what I could, when I could. And you did
the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not the same.&rdquo; Nynaeve tried to take the heat
out of her voice. &ldquo;It was my fault that you were there. My fault
that you are here. If you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She stopped to swallow again. &ldquo;If
you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;miss&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;when you shoot at me today, I want you to know
that I will understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not miss where I aim,&rdquo; Birgitte said dryly,
&ldquo;and where I aim will not be at you.&rdquo; She began taking things from
one of the cabinets and laying them on the small table.
Half-finished arrows, scraped shafts, steel arrow points, stone
glue pot, fine cord, gray goose feathers for fletchings. She had
said she would make her own bow, too, as soon as she could. Luca&rsquo;s
she called &ldquo;a knot-riddled branch broken from a cross-grained tree
by a blind idiot in the middle of the night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I liked you, Nynaeve,&rdquo; she said as she laid
everything out. &ldquo;Thorns, warts and all. I no longer do, as you are
now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have no reason to like me, now,&rdquo; Nynaeve said
miserably, but the other woman spoke right over her without looking
up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and I will not allow you to make me less, to
make my decisions less, by claiming responsibility for them. I have
had few women friends, but most have had tempers like
snowghosts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you could be my friend once more.&rdquo; What under
the Light was a snowghost? Something from another Age, no doubt. &ldquo;I
would never try to make you less, Birgitte. I only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Birgitte paid her no mind, except to raise her voice.
Her attention seemed all on her arrow shafts. &ldquo;I would like to like
you again, whether you return the liking or not, but I cannot until
you are yourself again. I could live with you a milk-tongued
sniveling wretch if that was what you were. I take people as they
are, not as I would like them to be, or else I leave them. But that
is not what you are, and I will not accept your reasons for playing
at it. So. Clarine told me of your encounter with Cerandin. Now I
know what to do the next time you claim my decisions as your own.&rdquo;
She swished a length of ashwood vigorously. &ldquo;I am sure Latelle will
be happy to provide the switch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve forced her jaws to unclench, forced her tone
as smooth as she could make it. &ldquo;You have a perfect right to do
whatever you wish to me.&rdquo; Her fists in her skirts quivered more
than her voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A touch of temper showing? Just at the edges?&rdquo;
Birgitte grinned at her, at once amused and startlingly feral. &ldquo;How
long before it bursts into flame? I am willing to wear out any
number of switches, if need be.&rdquo; The grin faded into seriousness.
&ldquo;I will make you see the right of this, or I will drive you away.
There is no other course. I cannot&mdash;will not&mdash;leave
Elayne. That bond honors me, and I will honor it, and her. And I
will not allow you to think that you make my decisions, or made
them. I am myself, not an appendage to you. Now go away. I must
finish these arrows if I am to have even a few shafts that will fly
true. I do not mean to kill you, and I would not have it happen by
accident.&rdquo; Unstopping the glue pot, she bent over the table. &ldquo;Do
not forget to curtsy like a good girl on your way out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve made it as far as the foot of the steps
before pounding her fist on her thigh in a fury. How dare the
woman? Did she think that she could just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Did she think that
Nynaeve would put up with&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? <em>I thought she could do
anything she wanted to you</em>, a small voice whispered in her
head. <em>I said she could kill me</em>, she snarled at it, <em>not
humiliate me!</em> Before much longer everybody would be
threatening her with that bloody Seanchan woman!</p>

<p>The wagons stood abandoned, except for a few
rough-coated horse handlers for guards, near the tall sprawling
canvas fence erected to contain Luca&rsquo;s show. From this large
brown-grass meadow half a mile from Samara the gray stone walls of
the city were clearly visible, with squat towers at the gates, and
a few of the taller buildings showing roofs of thatch or tile.
Outside the walls, villages of huts and rude shanties sprouted like
mushrooms in every direction, full of the Prophet&rsquo;s followers, and
they had stripped every tree for miles either for building or for
firewood.</p>

<p>The show&rsquo;s entrance for patrons was on the other
side, but two of the horse handlers with stout cudgels stood on
this side to discourage any who did not want to pay from entering
as the performers did. Nynaeve was almost upon them, striding as
hard as she could and muttering angrily to herself, when their
idiotic grins made her realize that the shawl was still looped over
her elbows. Her stare wiped their faces blank. Only then did she
cover herself properly, and slowly; she was not about to have these
louts think they could make her yelp and leap. The skinny one, with
a nose that took up half of his face, held the canvas flap aside,
and she ducked through into pandemonium.</p>

<p>Everywhere people thronged, in noisy milling clusters
of men and women and children, in chattering streams flowing from
one attraction to the next. All but the <em>s&rsquo;redit</em> performed
on raised wooden stages Luca had had built. Cerandin&rsquo;s boar-horses
had the largest crowd, the huge gray animals actually balancing on
their forelegs, even the baby, long snouts curved up sinuously,
while Clarine&rsquo;s dogs had the smallest, for all they did
back-springs and flips over each others&rsquo; backs. A good many people
paused to stare at the lions and the hairy boarlike <em>capars</em> in their
cages, the strangely horned deer from Arafel and Saldaea and Arad
Doman and the bright birds from the Light knew where, and some
waddling, brown-furred creatures with big eyes and round ears that
sat placidly eating leaves from branches gripped in their forepaws.
Luca&rsquo;s tale on where they came from varied&mdash;she supposed he
did not know&mdash;and he had not been able to make up a name for
them that pleased him. A huge snake from the marshes of Illian,
four times as long as a man, earned nearly as many gasps as the
<em>s&rsquo;redit</em>, although simply lying there, apparently asleep,
but she was pleased to see that Latelle&rsquo;s bears, at the moment
standing atop huge red wooden balls that they rolled in circles
with their feet, attracted few more than the dogs. Bears these
people could see in their own forests, even if these did have white
faces.</p>

<p>Latelle sparkled in the afternoon sunlight in her
black spangles. Cerandin glittered almost as much in blue, and
Clarine in green, though neither had quite as many sequins sewn on
as Latelle, but every last one of the dresses had a collar right up
under the chin. Of course, Petra and the Chavanas were performing
attired only in bright blue breeches, but that was to show off
their muscles. Only understandable. The acrobats were standing one
atop the other&rsquo;s shoulders, four high. Not far from them, the
strongman took a long bar with a large iron ball at each end&mdash;two men were needed to hand the thing up to him&mdash;and
immediately began twirling it in his thick hands, even spinning the
bar around his neck and across his back.</p>

<p>Thom was juggling fire, and eating it as well. Eight
flaming batons made a perfect circle: then suddenly he had four in
each hand, one sticking up from each cluster. Deftly popping each
upraised flaming end into his mouth in turn, he appeared to
swallow, and took them out extinguished, looking as if he had just
had something tasty. Nynaeve could not fathom how he did not scorch
his mustaches off, much less burn his throat. A twist of his
wrists, and the unlit batons folded into the lit like fans. A
moment later they were making two interlinked circles above his
head. He wore the same brown coat he always did, though Luca had
given him a red one sewn with sequins. From the way Thom&rsquo;s bushy
eyebrows rose as she stalked past, he did not understand why she
glared at him. His own coat, indeed!</p>

<p>She hurried on toward the thick, impatiently buzzing
crowd circled around the two tall poles with the rope stretched
tightly between. She had to use her elbows to reach the front row,
though two women did glare and snatch their men out of her way when
the shawl slipped. She would have glared back had she not been so
busy blushing and covering herself. Luca was there, frowning as
anxiously as a husband outside a birthing room, next to a thick
fellow with his head shaved except for a grizzled topknot. She
slipped in on the other side of Luca. The shaven-headed man had a
villainous look; a long scar sliced down his left cheek, and a
patch over that eye was painted with a scowling red replacement.
Few of the men she had seen here were armed with more than a belt
knife, but he wore a sword strapped to his back, the long hilt
rising above his right shoulder. He looked vaguely familiar for
some reason, but her mind was all on the highrope. Luca frowned at
the shawl, smiled at her, and tried to put an arm around her
waist.</p>

<p>While he was still trying to catch his breath from
her elbow and she was still getting her shawl decently back in
place, Juilin came staggering out of the crowd on the other side,
conical red hat tilted jauntily, coat half off one shoulder and a
wooden mug in his fist slopping over the rim. With the over-careful
steps of a man whose head contains more wine than brains, he
approached the rope ladder leading up to one of the high platforms
and stared at it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; someone shouted. &ldquo;Break your fool neck!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, friend,&rdquo; Luca called, starting forward with
smiles and flourishes of his cloak. &ldquo;That is no place for a man
with a belly full of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Setting the mug on the ground, Juilin scampered up
the ladder and stood swaying on the platform. Nynaeve held her
breath. The man had a head for heights, and well he should after a
life of chasing thieves across the rooftops of Tear, but still&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Juilin turned as if lost; he appeared too drunk to
see or remember the ladder. His eyes fixed on the rope.
Tentatively, he put one foot onto the narrow span, then drew it
back. Pushing the hat back to scratch his head, he studied the taut
rope, and abruptly brightened visibly. Slowly he got down on hands
and knees and crawled wobbling out onto the rope. Luca shouted for
him to come down, and the crowd roared with laughter.</p>

<p>Halfway across, Juilin stopped, swaying awkwardly,
and peered back, his eyes latching onto the mug he had left on the
ground. Plainly he was considering how to get back to it. Slowly,
with exceeding care, he stood, facing the way he had come and
wavering from side to side. A gasp rose from the crowd as his foot
slipped and he fell, somehow catching himself with one hand and a
knee hooked around the rope. Luca caught the Taraboner hat as it
fell, shouting to everyone that the man was mad, and whatever
happened was no responsibility of his. Nynaeve pressed both hands
tight against her middle; she could imagine being up there, and
even that was enough to make her feel ill. The man was a fool. A
pure bull-goose fool!</p>

<p>With an obvious effort, Juilin managed to catch the
rope with his other hand, and pulled himself along it
hand-over-hand. To the far platform. Swaying from side to side, he
brushed his coat, tried to pull it straight and succeeded only in
changing which shoulder hung down&mdash;and spotted his mug at the
floor of the other pole. Pointing to it gleefully, he stepped out
onto the rope again.</p>

<p>This time at least half the onlookers shouted for him
to go back, shouted that there was a ladder behind him; the others
only laughed uproariously, no doubt waiting for him to break his
neck. He walked across smoothly, slid down the rope ladder with his
hands and feet on the outside, and snatched up the wooden mug to
take a deep drink. Not until Luca clapped the red hat on Juilin&rsquo;s
head and they both bowed&mdash;Luca flourishing his cloak in such
a way that Juilin was behind it half the time&mdash;did the
watchers realize that it had all been part of the show. A moment of
silence, and then they exploded with applause and cheers and
laughter. Nynaeve had half thought they might turn ugly after being
duped. The fellow with the topknot looked villainous even while
laughing.</p>

<p>Leaving Juilin standing beside the ladder, Luca came
back to stand between, Nynaeve and the man with the topknot. &ldquo;I
thought that would go well.&rdquo; He sounded incredibly self-satisfied,
and he made little bows to the crowd as if he had been the one up
on the rope.</p>

<p>Giving him a sour frown, she had no time to speak the
acid comment on her tongue, because Elayne came bounding through
the crowd to stand beside Juilin with her arms upraised and one
knee bent.</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s mouth tightened, and she shifted her shawl
irritably. Whatever she thought of the red dress that she had found
herself wearing without really knowing how, she was not sure that
Elayne&rsquo;s costume was not worse. The Daughter-Heir of Andor was all
in snow white, with a scattering of white sequins sparkling on her
short coat and snug breeches. Nynaeve had not really believed that
Elayne would actually appear in the clothes in public, but she had
been too concerned over her own attire to give her opinion. The
coat and breeches made her think of Min. She had never approved of
Min wearing boy&rsquo;s clothes, but the color and spangles made these
even more&mdash;flagrant.</p>

<p>Juilin held the rope ladder for Elayne to climb,
though there was no need. She went up as adeptly as he could have.
He vanished into the crowd as soon as she reached the top, where
she posed again, beaming at the thunderous applause as if at the
adulation of her subjects. As she stepped out onto the rope&mdash;somehow it seemed even thinner than when Juilin had been on it&mdash;Nynaeve all but ceased breathing, and she stopped thinking
of Elayne&rsquo;s clothes, or her own, at all.</p>

<p>Elayne made her way out onto the rope, arms
outstretched to either side, and she was not channeling a platform
of Air. Slowly she stepped her way across, one foot in front of the
other, never wavering, supported only by the rope. Channeling would
be far too dangerous if Moghedien had even a clue to where they
were; the Forsaken or Black sisters could be in Samara, and they
would be able to feel the weave. And if they were not in Samara
now, they might be soon. On the far platform, Elayne paused to
considerably more applause than Juilin had received&mdash;Nynaeve
could not understand that&mdash;and started back. Almost to the
end, she pivoted smoothly, walked back halfway, pivoted again. And
wobbled, just catching herself. Nynaeve felt as though a hand had
her by the throat. At a slow steady pace, Elayne high-walked to the
platform, once more posing to thunderous shouts and clapping.</p>

<p>Nynaeve swallowed her heart and breathed again,
raggedly, but she knew it was not over.</p>

<p>Raising her hands above her head, Elayne suddenly
cartwheeled herself along the rope, black tresses whipping,
white-sheathed legs flashing in the sun. Nynaeve yelped and
clutched Luca&rsquo;s arm as the girl reached the far platform, stumbled
in landing and caught herself just short of going over the
edge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he murmured beneath the gasp
rising from the crowd. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen her do this every evening since
Sienda. And a good many other places, too, I would think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said weakly. Eyes fixed on Elayne,
she barely noticed the arm he slipped around her shoulders,
certainly not enough to do anything about it. She had tried to talk
the girl into feigning a sprained ankle, but Elayne insisted that
after all of that practice with the Power, she did not need it now.
Maybe Juilin did not&mdash;apparently he did not&mdash;but Elayne
had never gone scrambling over rooftops in the night.</p>

<p>The return cartwheels went perfectly, and the
landing, but Nynaeve did not look away, or loose her hold on Luca&rsquo;s
sleeve. After what now seemed the inevitable pause for applause,
Elayne returned to the rope for more pivots, one leg raised and
whipping down and up so quickly that it seemed she kept it
outstretched the whole while, and for a slow handstand that lifted
her straight as a dagger, white-slippered toes pointed to the sky.
And a backflip that had the crowd gasping and her swaying from side
to side, only just catching her balance. Thom Merrilin had taught
her that, and the handstand.</p>

<p>From the corner of her eye Nynaeve caught Thom, two
places down from her, eyes riveted to Elayne, poised on the balls
of his feet. He looked as proud as a peacock. He looked ready to
rush forward and catch her if she fell. If she did fall, it would
be at least partly his fault. He should never have taught her those
things!</p>

<p>One last passage of cartwheels, white legs flashing
and glittering in the sun, faster than before. A passage that had
never been mentioned to Nynaeve! She would have eviscerated Luca
with her tongue had he not muttered angrily that Elayne adding to
the act just for applause was a good way to break her neck. One
last pause to pose for more of that applause and Elayne at last
climbed down.</p>

<p>Shouting, the crowd rushed in on her. Luca and four
horse handlers with cudgels appeared around her as if by the Power,
but even so Thom beat them to her, limp and all.</p>

<p>Nynaeve jumped as high as she could, just managing to
see over enough heads to make out Elayne. The girl did not seem
frightened, or even taken aback, by all the waving hands trying to
touch her, stretching between her encircling guards. Head high,
face flushed from effort, she still managed a cool and regal grace
as she was escorted away. How she could do that, garbed as she was,
Nynaeve simply could not imagine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Face like a bloody queen,&rdquo; the one-eyed man muttered
to himself. He had not gone running with the others, but merely let
them stream past. Roughly dressed in a plain coat of dark gray
wool, he certainly looked solid enough to have no fears of being
knocked down and trampled. He appeared as if he could use that
sword. &ldquo;Burn me for a sheep-gutted farmer, but she&rsquo;s flaming well
brave enough for a bloody queen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve gaped at him as he strode away through the
crowd, and it was not his language. Or rather, it was, partly. Now
she remembered where she had seen him, a one-eyed man with a
topknot who could not say two sentences without the vilest
curses.</p>

<p>Forgetting about Elayne&mdash;she was certainly safe
enough&mdash;Nynaeve began pushing her way through the throng
after him.</p>
