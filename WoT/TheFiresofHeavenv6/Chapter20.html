<h4><em>Jangai Pass</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">U</span>nder
the looming Spine of the World, Rand guided
Jeade&rsquo;en up the stony slope from the foothills that began the foot
of Jangai Pass. The Dragonwall pierced the sky, dwarfing all other
mountains, its snowcapped peaks defying the baking afternoon sun.
The tallest thrust well above clouds that mocked the Waste with
promises of rain that had never come. Rand could not imagine why a
man would want to climb a mountain, but it was said that men who
had tried to scale these heights turned back, overcome with fear
and unable to breathe. He could well believe that a man might grow
too afraid to breathe, attempting to climb so high.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;yet though the Cairhienin are consumed with
the Game of Houses,&rdquo; Moiraine was saying at his shoulder, &ldquo;they
will follow you so long as they know that you are strong. Be firm
with them, but I would ask you to be fair also. A ruler who gives
true justice&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He tried to ignore her, as he did the other riders,
and the creak and rumble of Kadere&rsquo;s wagons, making heavy going
further back. The broken gorges and gullies of the Waste were
behind them, but these rugged rising hills, nearly as barren, were
little better for wagons. No one had traveled this path in over
twenty years.</p>

<p>Moiraine talked at him that way from daybreak to
sunset whenever he let her. Her lectures could be on small things&mdash;details of court behavior, say, in Cairhien or Saldaea or
somewhere else&mdash;or on large: the political influence of the
Whitecloaks, or perhaps the effects of trade on rulers&rsquo; decisions
to go to war. It was as if she meant to see him educated, as a
noble would be, or should be, before he reached the other side of
the mountains. It was surprising how often what she said reflected
what anyone back in Emond&rsquo;s Field would have called simple common
sense. And also how often it did not.</p>

<p>Occasionally she came out with something startling;
for instance, that he should trust no woman of the Tower except
herself, Egwene, Elayne and Nynaeve, or the news that Elaida was
now the Amyrlin Seat. Oath to obey or no, she would not tell him
how she knew that. She said it was someone else&rsquo;s place to tell if
she chose, someone else&rsquo;s secret, and she could not usurp it. He
suspected the Wise One dreamwalkers, though they had stared him
right in the eye and refused to say aye or nay. He wished he could
make them swear Moiraine&rsquo;s oath; they interfered between him and
the chiefs continually, as if they wanted him to go through them to
reach the chiefs.</p>

<p>Right that minute he did not want to think about
Elaida or the Wise Ones, or listen to Moiraine. Now he wanted to
study the pass ahead, a deep gap in the mountains that twisted as
though a blunt axe had tried to chop through again and again, never
quite succeeding. A few minutes hard ride, and he could be in
it.</p>

<p>On one side of the pass mouth a sheer cliff had been
smoothed over a hundred-pace width and carved, a wind-weathered
snake entwining a staff a good three hundred spans high; monument
or marker or ruler&rsquo;s sigil, it surely dated from some lost nation
before Artur Hawkwing, perhaps even before the Trolloc Wars. He had
seen remnants before from nations long vanished; often even
Moiraine did not know their source.</p>

<p>High on the other side, so far up that he was not
sure he was seeing what he thought, just below the snow line, stood
something even stranger. Something that made the first monument of
a few thousand years a commonplace. He could have sworn it was the
remnants of shattered buildings, shining gray against the darker
mountain, and stranger still, what appeared to be a dock of the
same material, as for ships, slanting drunkenly down the mountain.
If he was not imagining it, that had to date from before the
Breaking. The face of the world had been changed utterly in those
years. This could well have been an ocean&rsquo;s floor, before. He would
have to ask Asmodean. Even if he had had the time, he did not think
he would want to try reaching that altitude to find out for
himself.</p>

<p>At the foot of the huge snake lay Taien, a
high-walled town of moderate size, a remnant itself, of the time
when Cairhien had been allowed to send caravans across the
Three-fold Land, and wealth had flowed from Shara along the Silk
Path. There appeared to be birds above the town, and dark blotches
at regular intervals along the gray stone walls. Mat stood in Pips&rsquo;
stirrups, shading his eyes with that broad-brimmed hat to peer up
the pass, frowning. Lan&rsquo;s hard face wore no expression at all, yet
he appeared just as intent; a gust of wind, a little cooler here,
whipped his color-shifting cloak around him, and for a moment all
of him from shoulders to boots seemed to blend into the rocky hills
and sparse thornbushes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you listening to me?&rdquo; Moiraine said suddenly,
reining her white mare closer. &ldquo;You must&mdash;!&rdquo; She took a deep
breath. &ldquo;Please, Rand. There is so much that I must tell you, so
much that you need to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hint of pleading in her tone made him glance at
her. He could remember when he had been overawed by her presence.
Now she seemed quite small, for all her regal manner. A fool thing,
that he should feel protective of her. &ldquo;There is plenty of time
ahead of us, Moiraine,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t pretend to think I
know as much of the world as you. I mean to keep you close from now
on.&rdquo; He barely realized how great a change that was from when she
was keeping him close. &ldquo;But I have something else on my mind right
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; She sighed. &ldquo;As you wish. We have plenty
of time yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand heeled the dappled gray stallion to a trot, and
the others followed. The wagons quickened, too, though they could
not keep up on the slope. Asmodean&rsquo;s&mdash;Jasin Natael&rsquo;s&mdash;patch-covered gleeman&rsquo;s cloak rippled behind him like the banner
he carried at his stirrup, brilliant red with the white-and-black
symbol of the ancient Aes Sedai at its center. His face wore a
sullen glower; he had not been best pleased at having to be the
bannerman. Under that sign he would conquer, the Prophecy of
Rhuidean said, and perhaps it would not frighten the world so much
as the Dragon Banner, Lews Therin&rsquo;s banner, that he had left flying
over the Stone of Tear. Few would know this sign.</p>

<p>The blotches on the walls of Taien were bodies,
contorted in their final agonies, bloated in the sun and hanging by
their necks in a row that seemed to encircle the town. The birds
were glossy black ravens, and vultures with their heads and necks
befouled. Some ravens perched on corpses, gorging, unconcerned for
the new arrivals. The sickly sweet stench of corruption hung in the
dry air, and the acrid smell of char. Iron-strapped gates stood
gaping open on an expanse of ruin, soot-streaked stone houses and
collapsed roofs. Nothing moved except the birds.</p>

<p><em>Like Mar Ruois</em>. He tried to shake the
thought away, but in his head he could see that great city after it
was retaken, immense towers blackened and collapsing, the remains
of great bonfires at every street crossing, where those who had
refused to swear to the Shadow had been bound and thrown alive to
the flames. He knew whose memory it had to be, though he had not
discussed it with Moiraine. <em>I am Rand al&rsquo;Thor. Lews Therin
Telamon is dead three thousand years. I am myself!</em> That was
one battle he meant to win. If he did have to die at Shayol Ghul,
he would die as himself. He made himself think of something
else.</p>

<p>Half a month since he had left Rhuidean. Half a
month, though the Aiel had set a pace afoot from sunup to sundown
that wearied the horses. But Couladin had been moving this way a
week before he learned of it. If they had not managed to close any
ground, he would have that long to ravage Cairhien before Rand
could reach it. Longer, before the Shaido could be brought to bay.
Not a much happier thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s someone watching us from those rocks to the
left,&rdquo; Lan said quietly. He seemed to be completely engrossed in
studying what remained of Taien. &ldquo;Not Aiel, or I doubt I would
have seen a glimmer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand was glad that he had made Egwene and Aviendha
stay with the Wise Ones. The town gave him a new reason, but the
watcher fit in with his original plan, when he had hoped that
Taien had escaped. Egwene still wore the same Aiel clothes as
Aviendha, and Aiel would not have been very welcome in Taien. They
were even less likely to be welcome among the survivors.</p>

<p>He looked back at the wagons drawing to a halt a
short distance down-slope. Mutters drifted up from the drivers now
that they could see the town clearly, and the wall&rsquo;s decorations.
Kadere, his bulk all in white again today, mopped at his hawk-nosed
face with a large kerchief; he appeared unperturbed, merely pursing
his lips thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Rand expected that Moiraine would have to find new
drivers once they were through the pass. Kadere and his crew would
likely flee as soon as they had the chance. And he would have to
let them go. It was not right&mdash;it was not justice&mdash;but
it was necessary to protect Asmodean. How long now had he been
doing what was necessary instead of what was right? In a fair
world, they would be one and the same. That made him laugh, a
hoarse wheeze. He was far from the village boy he had been, but
sometimes that boy sneaked up on him. The others looked at him, and
he fought the urge to tell them that he was not mad yet.</p>

<p>Long minutes passed before two coatless men and a
woman emerged from the rocks, all three ragged and dirty and
barefoot. They approached hesitantly, heads tilted uneasily, eyes
darting from rider to rider, to the wagons and back, as though they
might take flight at a shout. Gaunt cheeks and wavering steps spoke
of hunger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank the Light,&rdquo; one of the men said finally. He
was gray-haired&mdash;none of the three was young&mdash;his face
deeply creased. His eyes lingered a moment on Asmodean, with falls
of lace at collar and cuffs, but the leader of this train would not
be riding a mule and carrying a banner. It was Rand&rsquo;s stirrup that
he clutched anxiously. &ldquo;The Light be praised that you came out of
those terrible lands alive, my Lord.&rdquo; That might have been Rand&rsquo;s
blue silk coat, embroidered in gold on the shoulders, or the
banner, or simple flattery. The man certainly had no reason to
think them other than merchants, if well dressed for it. &ldquo;Those
murdering savages have risen again. It is another Aiel War. They
were over the wall in the night before anybody knew, killing
everyone who raised a hand, stealing everything not mortared in
place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the night?&rdquo; Mat said sharply. Hat pulled low, he
was still studying the ruined town. &ldquo;Were your sentries asleep? You
did have sentries this close to your enemies? Even Aiel would have
a hard time coming at you if you kept a good watch.&rdquo; Lan gave him
an appraising look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my Lord.&rdquo; The gray-haired man blinked at Mat,
then gave his answer to Rand. Mat&rsquo;s green coat was fine enough for
a lord, but it hung open and looked slept in. &ldquo;We&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;We had only
a watchman at each gate. It has been long since any have even seen
one of the savages. But this time&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Whatever they did not
steal, they burned, and drove us out to starve. Filthy animals!
Thank the Light you have come to save us, my Lord, or we would all
have died here. I am Tal Nethin. I am&mdash;I was&mdash;a saddlemaker. A good one, my Lord. This is my sister Aril, and her
husband, Ander Corl. He makes fine boots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They stole people too, my Lord,&rdquo; the woman said, her
voice raw. Somewhat younger than her brother, she might have been
handsome once, but haggard worry had etched lines in her face that
Rand suspected would never entirely go away. Her husband had a lost
look in his eyes, as if not exactly sure where he was. &ldquo;My
daughter, my Lord, and my son. They took all the young ones,
everyone above sixteen, and some twice that or more. Said they were
guy-something, and stripped them naked right in the street and
herded them off. My Lord, can you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; She trailed off, eyes
squeezing shut as the impossibility overwhelmed her, swaying. Small
odds that she would ever see her children again.</p>

<p>Moiraine was out of her saddle in an instant and by
Aril&rsquo;s side. The haggard woman gave a loud gasp as soon as the Aes
Sedai&rsquo;s hands touched her, shivering to her toetips. Her wondering
look turned to Moiraine questioningly, but Moiraine only held her
as if supporting her.</p>

<p>The woman&rsquo;s husband suddenly gaped, staring at Rand&rsquo;s
gilded belt buckle, the gift from Aviendha. &ldquo;His arms were marked
like that. Like that. All twined around, like the cliff snake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tal looked up at Rand uncertainly. &ldquo;The savages&rsquo;
leader, my Lord. He&mdash;had markings like that on his arms. He
wore those strange clothes they all do, but he had his coatsleeves
cut off, and he made sure everybody saw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A gift I received in the Waste,&rdquo; Rand said. He made
sure to keep his hands still on his pommel; his coatsleeves hid his
own Dragons, except for the heads; they would be visible on the
backs of his hands to anyone who looked closely. He had forgotten
about wondering what Moiraine had actually done, and all three
looked on the point of running. &ldquo;How long since they left?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Six days, my Lord,&rdquo; Tal said uneasily. &ldquo;They did
what they did in a night and a day and were gone the next. We would
have gone, too, but what if we met them coming back? Surely they
were turned back at Selean?&rdquo; That was the town at the other end of
the pass. Rand doubted that Selean was in any better condition than
Taien by this time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many survivors are there besides you three?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe a hundred, my Lord. Maybe more. Nobody has
counted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly anger flared in him, though he tried to hold
it down. &ldquo;A hundred of you?&rdquo; His voice was icy iron. &ldquo;And six days?
Then why are your dead left for the ravens? Why do corpses still
decorate your town walls? Those are your people filling your
nostrils with their stink!&rdquo; Huddling together, the three backed
away from his horse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were afraid, my Lord,&rdquo; Tal said hoarsely. &ldquo;They
went, but they could come back. And he told us&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The one with
the markings on his arms told us not to touch anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A message,&rdquo; Ander said in a dull voice. &ldquo;He chose
them out to hang, just pulling them out until he had enough to line
the wall. Men, women, he did not care.&rdquo; His eyes were fixed on
Rand&rsquo;s buckle. &ldquo;He said they were a message for some man who would
be following him. He said he wanted this man to know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;know
what they were going to do on the other side of the Spine. He said&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He said he would do worse to this man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aril&rsquo;s eyes widened suddenly, and the three stared
beyond Rand for a moment, gaping. Then, screaming, they turned and
ran. Black-veiled Aiel rose from the rocks they had come from, and
they darted off in another direction. Veiled Aiel appeared there,
too, and they collapsed to the ground, sobbing and holding each
other as they were surrounded. Moiraine&rsquo;s face was cool and
composed, but her eyes were not serene.</p>

<p>Rand twisted in his saddle. Rhuarc and Dhearic were
coming up the slope, unveiling themselves and unwrapping the <em>
shoufa</em> from around their heads. Dhearic was thicker than
Rhuarc, with a prominent nose and paler streaks through his golden
hair. He had brought the Reyn Aiel as Rhuarc had said he would.</p>

<p>Timolan and his Miagoma had been paralleling them to
the north for three days, exchanging occasional messengers but
giving no clue to his intentions. The Codarra and the Shiande and
the Daryne were still somewhere to the east; following, so Amys and
the others said from dream-talking to their Wise Ones, but slowly.
Those Wise Ones had no more idea of their clan chiefs&rsquo; aims than
Rand did of Timolan&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was that necessary?&rdquo; he said as the two chiefs came
up to him. He had frightened the people first, but for cause, and
had not made them think that they were going to die.</p>

<p>Rhuarc simply shrugged, and Dhearic said, &ldquo;We put
spears in place around this hold unseen, as you wished, and there
seemed no reason to wait since no one remained here to dance
spears. Besides, they are only treekillers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand drew a deep breath. He had known this might be
as large a problem as Couladin, in its own way. Nearly five hundred
years ago the Aiel had presented Cairhien with a sapling, a cutting
from <em>Avendesora</em>, and with it a right granted to no other
nation, to trade across the Three-fold Land to Shara. They had
given no reason&mdash;they did not like wetlanders very much at
the best&mdash;but to the Aiel it had been required by <em>
ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>. During the long years of journey that had brought
them to the Waste, only one people had not attacked them, only one
had allowed them water uncontested when the world grew parched. And
finally they had found the descendants of those people. The
Cairhienin.</p>

<p>For five hundred years riches had flowed into
Cairhien with the silk and the ivory. Five hundred years, and <em>
Avendoraldera</em> grew in Cairhien. And then King Laman had the
tree cut down to make a throne. The nations knew why the Aiel had
crossed the Spine of the World twenty years ago&mdash;Laman&rsquo;s Sin,
they called it, and Laman&rsquo;s Pride&mdash;but few knew that to the
Aiel it had not been a war. Four clans had come to find an
oathbreaker, and when they had killed him, they returned to the
Three-fold Land. But their contempt for the treekillers, the
oathbreakers, had never died. Moiraine being Aes Sedai offset her
being Cairhienin, but Rand was never sure how much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These folk broke no oaths,&rdquo; he told them. &ldquo;Find the
others; the saddlemaker says there are about a hundred. And be
gentle with them. If any of them were watching, they&rsquo;re probably
running away into the mountains by now.&rdquo; The two Aiel started to
turn away, and he added, &ldquo;Did you hear what they told me? What do
you think of what Couladin did here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They killed more than they had to,&rdquo; Dhearic said
with a disgusted shake of his head. &ldquo;Like black ferrets falling on
rockhens&rsquo; nests in a gully.&rdquo; Killing was as easy as dying, so the
Aiel said; any fool could do either.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the other thing? Taking prisoners. <em>
Gai&rsquo;shain</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rhuarc and Dhearic exchanged looks, and Dhearic&rsquo;s
mouth tightened. Clearly they had heard, and it made them
uncomfortable. It took a great deal to make an Aiel
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It cannot be so,&rdquo; Rhuarc said at last. &ldquo;If it is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Gai&rsquo;shain</em> is a thing of <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>. No one can be
made <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> who does not follow <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>, else
they are only human animals, such as the Sharans keep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Couladin has abandoned <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>.&rdquo; Dhearic
sounded as though he were saying stones had grown wings.</p>

<p>Mat guided Pips closer, using his knees. He had never
been more than an indifferent rider, but sometimes, when he was
thinking of something else, he rode as though born on a horse&rsquo;s
back. &ldquo;That surprises you?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;After everything he has done
already? The man would cheat at dice with his mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They gave him flat-eyed stares, like blue stones. In
many ways, Aiel <em>were ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>. And whatever else Couladin
was, he was still Aiel in their eyes. Sept before clan, clan before
outsiders, but Aiel before wetlanders.</p>

<p>Some of the Maidens joined them, Enaila and Jolien
and Adelin, and wiry, white-haired Sulin, who had been chosen
roofmistress of the Roof of the Maidens in Rhuidean. She had told
the Maidens who stayed to choose another, and now she led the
Maidens here. They sensed the mood, and said nothing, only grounded
their spearpoints patiently. An Aiel who wanted to could make the
rocks look hasty.</p>

<p>Lan broke the silence. &ldquo;If Couladin expects you to be
following him, he may have left a surprise somewhere in the pass. A
hundred men could hold some of those narrows against an army. A
thousand&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will camp here, then,&rdquo; Rand said, &ldquo;and send
scouts ahead to make sure the way is clear. <em>Duadhe
Mahdi&rsquo;in</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Water Seekers,&rdquo; Dhearic agreed, sounding pleased.
That had been his society before he became clan chief.</p>

<p>Sulin and the other Maidens gave Rand flat stares as
the Reyn chief walked away downslope. He had chosen scouts from
other societies for the last three days, when he had begun to fear
what he might find here, and he had the feeling they knew he was
not just giving the others their turns. He tried to ignore their
looks. Sulin&rsquo;s was especially difficult; the woman could have
driven nails with those pale blue eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rhuarc, once the survivors are found, see that
they&rsquo;re fed. And well treated. We will take them with us.&rdquo; His gaze
was drawn to the town wall. Some Aiel were already using their
curved horn bows to kill ravens. Sometimes Shadowspawn used ravens
and other animals that fed on death as spies; Shadoweyes, the Aiel
called them. These barely paused in the frenzied feeding until they
fell transfixed with an arrow, but a wise man did not take chances
with ravens or rats. &ldquo;And see that the dead are buried.&rdquo; At least
in that, right and necessity were the same.</p>
