<h4><em>Ripped Away</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">Y</span>awning,
Elayne watched Nynaeve from her bed, her
head propped up on one elbow and black hair spilling down her arm.
It was really quite ridiculous, this insistence that whoever did
not go to <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> remain awake. She did not know
how long an interval Nynaeve had experienced in the World of
Dreams, but Elayne had been lying here for a good two hours, with
no book to read, no needlework to do, nothing at all to occupy her
except staring at the other woman stretched out on her own narrow
bed. Studying the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> was no good; she thought she had
wrung everything out of it that she could. She had even tried a
slight touch of Healing on the sleeping woman, perhaps all the
Healing she knew. Nynaeve would never have consented to it awake&mdash;she did not think much of Elayne&rsquo;s abilities in that
direction&mdash;or maybe she would have, in this case&mdash;but
her black eye was gone. In truth, that was the most complicated
Healing Elayne had ever done, and it really had exhausted her
skill. Nothing to do. If she had some silver, she might have tried
making an <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>; silver was not the only metal, but she
would have to melt coins to get enough. The other woman would be
less pleased at that than at finding a second <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>. If
Nynaeve had been willing to tell Thom and Juilin about this, at
least she could have invited Thom in for conversation.</p>

<p>They really did have the most delightful talks. Like
a father passing on his knowledge to his daughter. She had never
realized that the Game of Houses was so deeply embedded in Andor,
if thankfully not so deeply as it was in some other lands. Only the
Borderlands escaped it entirely, according to Thom. With the Blight
right to the north, and Trolloc raids a daily fact, they had no
time for maneuvering and scheming. She and Thom had wonderful
talks, now that he was sure she was not going to try snuggling into
his lap. Her face burned at the memory; she had actually thought of
that once or twice, and mercifully had not quite brought herself to
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even a queen stubs her toe, but a wise woman watches
the path,&rdquo; she quoted softly. Lini was a wise woman. Elayne did not
think she would make that particular mistake again. She knew she
made many, but seldom the same twice. One day, perhaps, she would
make few enough to be worthy to follow her mother on the
throne.</p>

<p>Suddenly she sat up. Tears were leaking from
Nynaeve&rsquo;s closed eyes, trickling down the sides of her face; what
Elayne had taken for a faint snore&mdash;Nynaeve <em>did</em>
snore, whatever she said&mdash;was a tiny, whimpering sob deep in
her throat. That should not be. If she had been injured, the hurt
would have appeared, although she would not feel it here until she
woke.</p>

<p><em>Perhaps I should wake her</em>. But she
hesitated, even as her hand stretched toward the other woman.
Waking someone out of <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> was far from easy&mdash;shaking, even icy water in the face would not always do&mdash;and Nynaeve would not appreciate being pummeled awake after
the bruising Cerandin had given her. <em>I wonder what really
happened. I will have to ask Cerandin</em>. Whatever was going on,
Nynaeve should be able to step out of the dream whenever she
wished. Unless&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Egwene said that the Wise Ones could hold
someone in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> against their will, though if
they had taught her the trick, she had not passed it on to Elayne
or Nynaeve. If someone was holding Nynaeve now, hurting her, it
could not be Birgitte, or the Wise Ones. Well, the Wise Ones might,
if they caught her wandering where they thought she should not. But
if not them, that left only&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She took hold of Nynaeve&rsquo;s shoulders to shake her&mdash;if that did not work, she would freeze the pitcher of water
on the table, or slap her face silly&mdash;and Nynaeve&rsquo;s eyes
popped open.</p>

<p>Immediately Nynaeve began to weep aloud, the most
despairing sound Elayne had ever heard. &ldquo;I killed her. Oh, Elayne,
I killed her with my foolish pride, thinking I could&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; The
words trailed off in openmouthed sobs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You killed who?&rdquo; It could not be Moghedien; that
woman&rsquo;s death would surely not bring this grief. She was about to
take Nynaeve in her arms to comfort her, when a pounding came at
the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send them away,&rdquo; Nynaeve mumbled, curling herself
into a trembling ball in the middle of the bed.</p>

<p>Sighing, Elayne made her way to the door and pulled
it open, but before she could say a word, Thom pushed past her out
of the night, rumpled shirt bagging out of his breeches, carrying
someone shrouded in his cloak in his arms. Only a woman&rsquo;s bare feet
showed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was just there,&rdquo; Juilin said behind him, as if
he did not believe the words coming out of his own mouth. Both men
were barefoot, and Juilin was stripped to the waist, lean and
hairless-chested. &ldquo;I woke for a moment, and suddenly she was
standing there, naked as the day she was born, collapsing like a
cut net.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s alive,&rdquo; Thom said, laying the cloak-wrapped
figure on Elayne&rsquo;s bed, &ldquo;but only barely. I could hardly hear her
heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frowning, Elayne pulled aside the cloak&rsquo;s hood&mdash;and found herself staring at Birgitte&rsquo;s face, pale and wan.</p>

<p>Nynaeve scrambled stiffly from the other bed to kneel
beside the unconscious woman. Her face glistened with tears, but
her weeping had stopped. &ldquo;She is alive,&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;She is
alive.&rdquo; Abruptly she seemed to realize that she was in her shift in
front of the men, but she barely spared them a glance, and all she
said was &ldquo;Get them out of here, Elayne. I can do nothing with them
gawking like sheep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom and Juilin rolled their eyes toward each other
when Elayne made a herding motion at them, and shook their heads
slightly, but they backed toward the door without complaint. &ldquo;She
is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a friend,&rdquo; Elayne told them. She felt as if she were
moving in a dream, floating, without feeling. How could this be?
&ldquo;We will take care of her.&rdquo; How could it possibly have happened?
&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t say a word to anyone.&rdquo; The looks they gave her as she
closed the door nearly made her blush. Of course they knew better
than to talk. But men did have to be reminded of the simplest
things sometimes, even Thom. &ldquo;Nynaeve, how under the Light,&rdquo; she
began, turning, and cut off as the glow of <em>saidar</em>
surrounded the kneeling woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn her!&rdquo; Nynaeve growled, channeling fiercely.
&ldquo;Burn her forever for doing this!&rdquo; Elayne recognized the flows
being woven for Healing, but recognition was as far as she could
go. &ldquo;I will find her, Birgitte,&rdquo; Nynaeve muttered. Strands of
Spirit predominated, but Water and Air were in there, and even
Earth and Fire. It looked as complicated as embroidering one dress
with either hand, and two more with your feet. Blindfolded. &ldquo;I will
make her pay.&rdquo; The glow shining about Nynaeve grew and grew, until
it overwhelmed the lamps, until it hurt to book at her except
through slitted eyes. &ldquo;I swear it! By the Light and my hope of
salvation and rebirth, I will!&rdquo; The anger in her voice changed,
becoming deeper if anything. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t working. There is nothing
wrong with her to Heal. She is as perfect as anyone can be. But she
is dying. Oh, Light, I can feel her slipping away. Burn Moghedien!
Burn her! And burn me along with her!&rdquo; She was not giving up,
though. The weaving continued, complex flows weaving into Birgitte.
And the woman lay there, golden braid flung over the side of the
bed, the rise and fall of her chest slowing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can do something that might help,&rdquo; Elayne said
slowly. You were supposed to have permission, but it had not always
been so. Once it had been done almost as often without as with.
There was no reason it should not work on a woman. Except that she
had never heard of it being done to any but men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Linking?&rdquo; Nynaeve did not look away from the woman
on the bed, or stop her efforts with the Power. &ldquo;Yes. You will have
to do it&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how&mdash;but let me guide. I do not
know half what I am doing right this minute, but I know that I
<em>can</em> do it. You could not Heal a bruise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s mouth tightened, but she let the remark lie.
&ldquo;Not linking.&rdquo; The amount of <em>saidar</em> that Nynaeve had drawn
into herself was amazing. If she could not Heal Birgitte with that,
what Elayne could add would not make a difference. Together, they
would be stronger than either apart, but not as strong as if their
two strengths were simply added. Besides, she was not certain that
she could link. She had only been linked once, and an Aes Sedai had
done it, to show her what it was like more than how. &ldquo;Stop,
Nynaeve. You said yourself it is not working. Stop and let me try.
If it doesn&rsquo;t work, you can&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She could what? If Healing
worked, it worked; if it did not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;There was no point in trying
again if it failed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try what?&rdquo; Nynaeve snapped, yet she moved away
awkwardly, letting Elayne come close. The weave of Healing faded,
but not the shining nimbus.</p>

<p>Instead of answering, Elayne put one hand on
Birgitte&rsquo;s forehead. Physical contact was as necessary for this as
for Healing, and the two times she had watched it done in the
Tower, the Aes Sedai had touched the man&rsquo;s forehead. The flows of
Spirit she wove were complex, if not so intricate as Nynaeve&rsquo;s of a
moment before. She barely understood some of what she was doing,
and none at all of other parts, yet she had paid close attention,
from her hiding place, to how the weave was shaped. Watched closely
because she had built up a stock of stories in her head, made silly
romances where there so seldom were any. After a moment, she sat
down on the other bed and let <em>saidar</em> go.</p>

<p>Nynaeve frowned at her, then bent to examine
Birgitte. The unconscious woman&rsquo;s color was perhaps a little
better, her breathing a little stronger. &ldquo;What did you do, Elayne?&rdquo;
Nynaeve did not take her eyes from Birgitte, but the glow around
her faded away slowly. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t Healing. I think I could do it
myself, now, but it was not Healing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will she live?&rdquo; Elayne asked faintly. There was no
visible link between her and Birgitte, no flows, but she could
sense the woman&rsquo;s weakness. A terrible weakness. She would know the
moment Birgitte died, even if she was sleeping, or hundreds of
miles away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know. She isn&rsquo;t fading anymore, but I do
not know.&rdquo; Weariness made Nynaeve&rsquo;s voice soft, and pain touched it
strongly, as if she shared Birgitte&rsquo;s injury. Wincing, she rose and
unfolded a red-striped blanket to spread over the woman lying
there. &ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silence held Elayne long enough for Nynaeve to join
her, lowering herself awkwardly onto the bed. &ldquo;Bonding,&rdquo; Elayne
said finally. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;bonded her. As a Warder.&rdquo; The incredulous
stare on the other woman&rsquo;s face made her rush on. &ldquo;Healing was
doing no good. I had to do something. You know the gifts a Warder
gets from being bonded. One is strength, energy. He can keep going
when other men would collapse and die, survive wounds that would
kill anyone else. It was the only thing I could think of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve drew a deep breath. &ldquo;Well, it is working
better than what I did, at least. A woman Warder. I wonder what Lan
will think of that? No reason why she shouldn&rsquo;t be. If any woman
can, it would be her.&rdquo; Wincing, she curled her legs up beneath her,
her gaze kept returning to Birgitte. &ldquo;You will have to keep this
secret. If anyone learns that an Accepted has bonded a Warder,
whatever the circumstances&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne shivered. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said simply, and quite
fervently. It was not quite a stilling offense, but any Aes Sedai
would very likely make her wish she had been stilled. &ldquo;Nynaeve,
what happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a long moment she thought the other woman was
going to start crying again as her chin quivered and her lips
worked. When she began speaking, her voice was iron, her face a
blend of fury and too many tears ever to shed. She told the tale
starkly, almost sketchily, until she came to Moghedien&rsquo;s appearance
among the wagons. That she rendered in painful detail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should be welted from the neck down,&rdquo; she said
bitterly at last, touching a smooth, unmarked arm. Unmarked or not,
she flinched. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand why I am not. I feel it, but I
deserve the welts, for stupid, foolish pride. For being too afraid
to do what I should. I deserved being hung up like a ham in a
smokehouse. If there was any justice, I would still be dangling
there, and Birgitte would not be lying on that bed, with us
wondering whether she&rsquo;ll live or not. If only I knew more. If only
I could have Moghedien&rsquo;s knowledge for five minutes, I
<em>could</em> Heal her. I am sure of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you were still hanging,&rdquo; Elayne said practically,
&ldquo;in a very short while you would be waking up and shielding me. I
don&rsquo;t doubt Moghedien would have seen to it that you were angry
enough to channel&mdash;she knows us all too well, remember&mdash;and I do doubt very much that I would have suspected anything until
you had done it. I do not fancy being carted off to Moghedien, and
I cannot believe you do either.&rdquo; The other woman did not look at
her. &ldquo;It must have been a link, Nynaeve, like an <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>.
That is how she made you feel pain without marking you.&rdquo; Nynaeve
still sat there in a glowering sulk. &ldquo;Nynaeve, Birgitte is still
alive. You did everything you could for her, and the Light willing,
she will live. It was Moghedien who did this to her, not you. A
soldier who takes blame for his comrades who fall in battle is a
fool. You and I are soldiers in a battle, but you are not a fool,
so stop behaving like one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve did look at her then, a scowl that lasted
only a moment before she turned her face completely away. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo; Her voice sank almost to a whisper. &ldquo;She&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;one of the heroes bound to the Wheel of Time,
destined to be born again and again to make legends. She wasn&rsquo;t
born this time, Elayne. She was ripped out of
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> as she stood. Is she still bound to the
Wheel? Or has she been ripped away from that, too? Ripped away from
what her own courage earned her, because I was so proud, so
man-stubborn stupid, that I made her hunt for Moghedien?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne had hoped that those questions had not
occurred to Nynaeve yet, would not until she had had a little time
to recover first. &ldquo;Do you know how badly Moghedien was hurt? Maybe
she is dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; the other woman almost snarled. &ldquo;I want
to make her pay&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She took a deep breath, but instead of
invigorating her, it seemed to make her sag. &ldquo;I would not count on
her dying. Birgitte&rsquo;s shot missed her heart. A wonder she managed
to hit the woman at all, staggering as she was. I could not have
stood up if I were thrown that far, hard enough to bounce like
that. I couldn&rsquo;t even stand up after what Moghedien did to me. No,
she is alive, and we had best believe that she can have her wound
Healed and be after us by morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She would still need time to rest, Nynaeve. You know
that. Can she even know where we are? From what you said, she had
no time to do more than see that this is a menagerie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What if she did see more?&rdquo; Nynaeve rubbed her
temples as if it were difficult to think. &ldquo;What if she knows
<em>exactly</em> where we are? She could send Darkfriends after us.
Or send word to Darkfriends in Samara.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Luca is livid because eleven menageries are already
around the city, and three more are waiting to cross the bridge.
Nynaeve, it will take her days to regain strength after a wound
like that, even if she does find some Black sister to Heal her, or
one of the other Forsaken. And more days to search through fifteen
menageries. That is if there are not more on the road behind us, or
coming from Altara. If she does come after us or send Darkfriends,
either one, we are forewarned, and we have days to find a boat that
can carry us downriver.&rdquo; She paused a moment, thinking. &ldquo;Do you
have anything to dye your hair in that bag of herbs? I&rsquo;ll wager
anything that you had your hair braided in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>.
Mine is always its natural color, there. If yours is loose, as it
is now, and another color, it will make us that much harder to
find.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whitecloaks everywhere,&rdquo; Nynaeve sighed. &ldquo;Galad. The
Prophet. No boats. It is as if everything is conspiring to hold us
here for Moghedien. I am so tired, Elayne. Tired of being afraid of
who might be around the next corner. Tired of being afraid of
Moghedien. I cannot seem to think of what to do next. My hair?
Nothing that would make it any color I&rsquo;d have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need to sleep,&rdquo; Elayne, said firmly. &ldquo;Without
the ring. Give it to me.&rdquo; The other woman hesitated, but Elayne
merely waited with her hand outstretched until Nynaeve fished the
flecked stone ring from the cord around her neck. Stuffing it into
her pouch, Elayne went on. &ldquo;Now you lie down here, and I will watch
Birgitte.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve stared at the woman stretched out on the
other bed for a moment, then shook her head. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sleep. I need
to be alone. To walk.&rdquo; Getting to her feet as stiffly as if she
really had been beaten, she took her dark cloak from its peg and
swung it over her shift. At the door she paused. &ldquo;If she wants to
kill me,&rdquo; she said bleakly, &ldquo;I do not know that I could make myself
stop her.&rdquo; She went into the night barefoot and sad-faced.</p>

<p>Elayne hesitated, unsure which woman needed her more,
before settling back where she sat. Nothing she said could make
things better for Nynaeve, but she had faith in the woman&rsquo;s
resilience. Time alone to work it all over in her mind, and she
would see that blame lay at Moghedien&rsquo;s door, not hers. She had
to.</p>
