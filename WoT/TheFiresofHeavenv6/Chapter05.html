<h4><em>Among the Wise Ones</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">S</span>tanding
as close as she could to the small fire in
the middle of the tent, Egwene still shivered as she poured water
from the generous teakettle into a wide, blue-striped bowl. She had
lowered the sides of the tent, but cold seeped through the colorful
layered rugs covering the ground, and all the fire&rsquo;s heat seemed to
rush up and out of the smoke hole in the middle of the tent roof,
leaving only the smell of the burning cow dung. Her teeth wanted to
chatter.</p>

<p>Already the steam from the water was beginning to
fade; she embraced <em>saidar</em> for a moment and channeled Fire
to heat it more. Amys or Bair would probably have washed in it
cold, though in fact they always took sweat baths. <em>So I&rsquo;m not
as tough as they are. I did not grow up in the Waste. I don&rsquo;t have
to freeze to death and wash in cold water if I don&rsquo;t want to</em>.
She still felt guilty as she lathered a cloth with a piece of
lavender-scented soap bought from Hadnan Kadere. The Wise Ones had
never asked her to do differently, but it still felt like
cheating.</p>

<p>Letting go of the True Source made her sigh with
remorse. Even trembling with cold, she laughed softly at her own
foolishness. The wonder of being filled with the Power, the
wondrous rush of life and awareness, was its own danger. The more
you drew on <em>saidar</em>, the more you wanted to draw, and
without self-discipline you eventually drew more than you could
handle and either died or stilled yourself. And that was nothing to
laugh at.</p>

<p><em>That&rsquo;s one of your biggest faults</em>, she
lectured herself firmly. <em>You always want to do more than you&rsquo;re
supposed to. You ought to wash in cold water; that would teach you
self-discipline</em>. Only there was so much to learn, and it
sometimes seemed a lifetime would be too short to learn it. Her
teachers were always so cautious, whether Wise Ones or Aes Sedai in
the Tower; it was hard to hold back when she knew that in so many
ways she already outstripped them. <em>I can do more than they
realize</em>.</p>

<p>A blast of freezing air hit her, swirling smoke from
the fire about the tent, and a woman&rsquo;s voice said, &ldquo;If it pleases
you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene jumped, yelping shrilly before managing to get
out, &ldquo;Shut that!&rdquo; She hugged herself to stop from capering. &ldquo;Get in
or get out, but shut it!&rdquo; All that effort to be warm, and now she
was icy goose bumps from head to toe!</p>

<p>The white-robed woman shuffled into the tent on her
knees and let the tent flap drop. She kept her eyes downcast, her
hands folded meekly; she would have done the same if Egwene had hit
her instead of just shouting. &ldquo;If it pleases you,&rdquo; she said softly,
&ldquo;the Wise One Amys sent me to bring you to the sweat tent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wishing she could stand on top of the fire, Egwene
groaned. <em>The Light burn Bair and her stubbornness!</em> If not
for the white-haired old Wise One, they could be in rooms in the
city instead of tents on the edge of it. <em>I could have a room
with a proper fireplace. And a door</em>. She was willing to bet
that Rand did not have to put up with people wandering in on him
whenever they wanted. <em>Rand bloody Dragon al&rsquo;Thor snaps his
fingers, and the Maidens jump like serving girls. I&rsquo;ll wager
they&rsquo;ve found him a real bed, instead of a pallet on the
ground</em>. She was sure that he got a hot bath every night. <em>
The Maidens probably haul buckets of hot water up to his rooms.
I&rsquo;ll bet they even found him a proper copper bathtub</em>.</p>

<p>Amys, and even Melaine, had been amenable to Egwene&rsquo;s
suggestion, but Bair had put her foot down, and they acquiesced
like <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>. Egwene supposed that with Rand bringing so
much change, Bair wanted to hold on to as much of the old ways as
she could, but she wished the woman could have chosen something
else to be intractable over.</p>

<p>There was no thought of refusing. She had promised
the Wise Ones to forget that she was Aes Sedai&mdash;the easy
part, since she was not&mdash;and do exactly as she was told. That
was the hard part; she had been away from the Tower long enough to
become her own mistress again. But Amys had told her flatly that
dreamwalking was dangerous even after you knew what you were about
and far more so until then. If she would not obey in the waking
world, they could not trust her to obey in the dream<em>,</em> and
they would not take the responsibility. So she did chores right
along with Aviendha, accepted chastisement with as good a grace as
she could muster, and hopped whenever Amys or Melaine or Bair said
frog. In a manner of speaking. None of them had ever seen a frog.
<em>Not that they&rsquo;ll want anything but for me to hand them their
tea</em>. No, it would be Aviendha&rsquo;s turn to do that tonight.</p>

<p>For a moment she considered donning stockings, but
finally just bent to slip on her shoes. Sturdy shoes, suitable for
the Waste; she rather regretted the silk slippers she had worn in
Tear. &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; she asked, trying to be
companionable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cowinde&rdquo; was the docile reply.</p>

<p>Egwene sighed. She kept trying to be friends with the
<em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>, but they never responded. Servants were one
thing she had not had a chance to get used to, though of course
<em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> were not precisely servants. &ldquo;You were a
Maiden?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A quick, fierce flash of deep blue eyes told her that
her guess was correct, but just as quickly they lowered again. &ldquo;I
am <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>. Before and after are not now, and only now
exists.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your sept and clan?&rdquo; Usually there was no
need to ask, not even with <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I serve the Wise One Melaine of the Jhirad sept, of
the Goshien Aiel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trying to choose between two cloaks, a stout brown
woolen and a blue quilted silk she had purchased from Kadere&mdash;the merchant had sold everything in his wagons to make room for
Moiraine&rsquo;s freight, and at very good prices&mdash;Egwene paused to
frown at the woman. That was no proper response. She had heard that
a form of the bleakness had taken some <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>; when
their year and a day was done, they simply refused to put off the
robe. &ldquo;When is your time up?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>Cowinde crouched lower, almost huddling over her
knees. &ldquo;I am <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But when will you be able to return to your sept, to
your own hold?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>,&rdquo; the woman hoarsely told
the rugs in front of her face. &ldquo;If the answer displeases, punish
me, but I can give no other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly,&rdquo; Egwene said sharply. &ldquo;And
straighten up. You aren&rsquo;t a toad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The white-robed woman obeyed immediately and, sat
there on her heels, submissively awaiting another command. That
brief flare of spirit might as well never have been.</p>

<p>Egwene took a deep breath. The woman had made her own
accommodation with the bleakness. A foolish one, but nothing she
could say would change it. Anyway, she was supposed to be on her
way to the sweat tent, not talking with Cowinde.</p>

<p>Remembering that cold draft, she hesitated. The icy
gust had made two large white blossoms, resting in a shallow bowl,
curl partway closed. They came from a plant called a <em>
segade</em>, a fat, leafless, leathery thing that bristled with
spines. She had come on Aviendha looking at them in her hands that
morning; the Aiel woman had given a start when she saw her, then
pushed them into Egwene&rsquo;s hands, saying she had picked them for
her. She supposed there was enough of the Maiden left in Aviendha
that she did not want to admit liking flowers. Though come to think
of it, she had seen the occasional Maiden wearing a blossom in her
hair or on her coat.</p>

<p><em>You are just trying to put it off, Egwene al&rsquo;Vere.
Now stop being a silly wool-head. You are being as foolish as
Cowinde</em>. &ldquo;Lead the way,&rdquo; she said, and just had time to swing
the woolen cloak around her nakedness before the woman swept open
the tent flap for her, and for the bone-chilling night.</p>

<p>Overhead, the stars were crisp points in the
darkness, and the three-quarter moon was bright. The Wise Ones&rsquo;
camp was a cluster of two dozen low mounds, not a hundred paces
from where one of Rhuidean&rsquo;s paved streets ended in hard, cracked
clay and stones. Moonshadows turned the city into strange cliffs
and crags. Every tent had its flaps down, and the smells of fires
and cooking blended to fill the air.</p>

<p>The other Wise Ones came here for almost daily
gatherings, but they spent nights with their own septs. Several
even slept in Rhuidean now. But not Bair. This was as close to the
city as Bair had been willing to come; if Rand had not been there,
doubtless she would have insisted on making camp in the
mountains.</p>

<p>Egwene held the cloak tight with both hands and
walked as fast as she could. Icy tendrils curled under the cloak&rsquo;s
bottom, swept in every time her bare legs kicked a gap open.
Cowinde had to pull her white robes to her knees in order to keep
ahead. Egwene did not need the <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>&rsquo;s guidance, but
since the woman had been sent to bring her, she would be shamed and
maybe offended if not allowed to. Clenching her teeth to keep them
from chattering, Egwene wished the woman would run.</p>

<p>The sweat tent looked like any other, low and wide,
with the flaps lowered all around, except that the smoke hole had
been covered. Nearby a fire had burned down to glowing embers
scattered over a few rocks the size of a man&rsquo;s head. There was not
enough light to define the much smaller shadowed mound beside the
tent entrance, but she knew it was neatly folded women&rsquo;s
clothes.</p>

<p>Taking one deep, chilling breath, she hurriedly
scuffed off her shoes, let her cloak drop, and all but dove into
the tent. An instant of shuddering cold before the flap fell shut
behind her, then steamy heat clamped down, squeezing out sweat that
covered her in an instant sheen while she was still gasping and
shaking.</p>

<p>The three Wise Ones who were teaching her about
dreamwalking sat sweating unconcernedly, their waist-length hair
hanging damply. Bair was talking to Melaine, whose green-eyed
beauty and red-gold hair made a sharp contrast to the older woman&rsquo;s
leathery face and long white tresses. Amys was white-haired, too&mdash;or perhaps it was just so pale a yellow that it seemed white&mdash;but she did not look old. She and Melaine could both channel&mdash;not many Wise Ones could&mdash;and she had something of the
Aes Sedai look of agelessness about her. Moiraine, seeming slight
and small beside the others, also looked unruffled, although sweat
rolled down her pale nudity and slicked her dark hair to her scalp,
with a regal refusal to acknowledge that she had no clothes on. The
Wise Ones were using slim, curved pieces of bronze, called <em>
staera</em>, to scrape off sweat and the day&rsquo;s dirt.</p>

<p>Aviendha was squatting sweatily beside the big black
kettle of hot, sooty rocks in the middle of the tent, carefully
using a pair of tongs to move a last stone from a smaller kettle to
the larger. That done, she sprinkled water onto the rocks from a
gourd, adding to the steam. If she let the steam fall too far, she
would be spoken to sharply at the very least. The next time the
Wise Ones met in the sweat tent, it would be Egwene&rsquo;s turn to tend
the rocks.</p>

<p>Egwene cautiously sat down cross-legged next to Bair&mdash;instead of layered rugs, there was only rocky ground, unpleasantly
hot, lumpy and damp&mdash;and realized with a shock that Aviendha had
been switched, and recently. When the Aiel woman gingerly took her
own place, beside Egwene, she did so with a face as stony as the
ground, but a face that could not hide her flinch.</p>

<p>This was something Egwene did not expect; The Wise
Ones exacted a hard discipline&mdash;harder even than the Tower,
which took some doing&mdash;but Aviendha worked at learning to
channel with a grim determination. She could not dreamwalk, but she
surely put as much effort into absorbing every art of a Wise One as
she could ever have put into learning her weapons as a Maiden. Of
course, after she confessed to letting Rand know about the Wise
Ones watching his dreams, they had made her spend three days
digging shoulder-deep holes and filling them in again, but that was
one of the few times Aviendha had ever seemed to put a foot wrong.
Amys and the other two had held her up to Egwene so often as a
model of meek obedience and proper fortitude that sometimes Egwene
wanted to shriek, even if Aviendha was a friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You took long enough in coming,&rdquo; Bair said grumpily,
while Egwene was still gingerly searching for a comfortable seat.
Her voice was thin and reedy, but a reed of iron. She continued to
scrape her arms with a <em>staera</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; Egwene said. There; that should be meek
enough.</p>

<p>Bair sniffed. &ldquo;You are Aes Sedai beyond the
Dragonwall, but here you are yet a pupil, and a pupil does not
dally. When I send for Aviendha, or send her for something, she
runs, even if all I want is a pin. You could do much worse than to
pattern yourself after her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flushing, Egwene tried to make her voice humble. &ldquo;I
will try, Bair.&rdquo; This was the first time a Wise One had made the
comparison in front of others. She sneaked a glance at Aviendha and
was surprised to find her looking thoughtful. Sometimes she wished
her &ldquo;near-sister&rdquo; were not always such a good example.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The girl will learn, Bair, or she will not,&rdquo; Melaine
said irritably. &ldquo;Instruct her in promptness later, if she still
needs it.&rdquo; No more than ten or twelve years older than Aviendha,
she usually sounded as if she had a burr under her skirts. Maybe
she was sitting on a sharp rock. She would not move if she was; she
would expect the rock to move. &ldquo;I tell you again, Moiraine Sedai,
the Aiel follow He Who Comes With the Dawn, not the White
Tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Obviously, Egwene was meant to pick up what they were
talking about as they went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be,&rdquo; Amys said in a level voice, &ldquo;that the
Aiel will serve the Aes Sedai again, but that time has not come
yet, Moiraine Sedai.&rdquo; Her scraping barely paused as she eyed the
Aes Sedai calmly.</p>

<p>It would come, Egwene knew, now that Moiraine was
aware that some of the Wise Ones could channel. Aes Sedai would be
journeying into the Waste to find girls who could be taught, and
would almost certainly be trying to take any Wise One with the
ability back to the Tower, too. Once she had worried about the Wise
Ones being browbeaten and dominated, hauled away whenever they
wanted; Aes Sedai never let any woman who could channel run free of
the Tower for long. She did not worry anymore, though the Wise Ones
themselves seemed to. Amys and Melaine could match any Aes Sedai
will for will, as they showed every day with Moiraine. Bair could
very likely make even Siuan Sanche jump through hoops, and Bair
could not even channel.</p>

<p>For that matter, Bair was not the strongest-willed
Wise One. That honor went to an even older woman; Sorilea, of the
Jarra sept of the Chareen Aiel. The Wise One of Shende Hold could
channel less than most novices, but she was as likely to send
another Wise One on an errand as a <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>. And they
went. No, there was no reason to distress herself over Wise Ones
being bullied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is understandable that you wish to spare your
lands,&rdquo; Bair put in, &ldquo;but Rand al&rsquo;Thor obviously does not mean to
lead us to punish. No one who submits to He Who Comes With the
Dawn, and the Aiel, will be harmed.&rdquo; So that was it. Of course.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not only sparing lives or lands that concerns
me.&rdquo; Moiraine made wiping sweat from her brow with one finger into
a queenly gesture, but her voice sounded nearly as tight as Melaine&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;If you allow this, it will be disastrous. Years of planning are
coming to fruition, and he means to ruin it all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plans of the White Tower,&rdquo; Amys said, so smoothly
she might have been agreeing. &ldquo;Those plans have nothing to do with
us. We, and the other Wise Ones, must consider what is right for
the Aiel. We will see that the Aiel do what is best for the
Aiel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene wondered what the clan chiefs would say about
that. Of course, they frequently complained that the Wise Ones
meddled in matters that were not theirs, so perhaps it would not
come as a surprise. The chiefs all seemed to be hard-willed,
intelligent men, but she believed they had as much chance against
the combined Wise Ones as the Village Council back home did against
the Women&rsquo;s Circle.</p>

<p>This time, though, Moiraine was right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Rand&mdash;&rdquo; she began, but Bair stepped on her
firmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will hear what you have to say later, girl. Your
knowledge of Rand al&rsquo;Thor is valuable, but you will hold your peace
and listen until you are bidden to speak. And stop looking sullen,
or I will dose you with bluespine tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene grimaced. Respect for the Aes Sedai, though a
respect between equals, included but little for the pupil, even one
they believed <em>was</em> Aes Sedai. She kept her tongue still, in
any case. Bair was capable of sending her to fetch her herb pouches
and telling her to brew the incredibly bitter tea herself; it had
no purpose at all except to cure sullenness or sulkiness or
whatever else a Wise One might find disfavor with, which it did by
taste alone. Aviendha gave her a comforting pat on the arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You believe it will not be a catastrophe for the
Aiel as well?&rdquo; It must have been difficult to sound as cool as a
winter stream when you glistened from head to foot with condensed
steam and your own sweat, but Moiraine apparently had no
difficulty. &ldquo;It will be the Aiel War all over again. You will kill
and burn and loot towns as you did then, until you have turned
every man and woman against you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fifth is our due, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Melaine said,
throwing her long hair back over her shoulder so she could work a
<em>staera</em> across a smooth shoulder. Even heavy and damp with
the steam, her hair glistened like silk. &ldquo;We took no more even from
the treekillers.&rdquo; Her glance at Moiraine was too bland not to be
significant; they knew she was Cairhienin. &ldquo;Your kings and queens
take as much in their taxes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when the nations turn against you?&rdquo; Moiraine
persisted. &ldquo;In the Aiel War, the nations united turned you back.
That can and will happen again, with great loss of life on both
sides.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of us fears death, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Amys told her,
smiling gently as if explaining something to a child. &ldquo;Life is a
dream from which we all must wake before we can dream again.
Besides, only four clans crossed the Dragonwall under Janduin. Six
are here already, and you say Rand al&rsquo;Thor means to take all of the
clans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Prophecy of Rhuidean says he will break us.&rdquo; The
spark in Melaine&rsquo;s green eyes could have been for Moiraine or
because she was not as resigned as she sounded. &ldquo;What does it
matter whether it is here or beyond the Dragonwall?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will lose him the support of every nation west
of the Dragonwall,&rdquo; Moiraine said. She looked as calm as ever, but
an edge in her voice said she was ready to chew rocks. &ldquo;He must
have their support!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has the support of the Aiel nation,&rdquo; Bair told
her in that fragile, unyielding voice. She emphasized her words by
gesturing with the slim metal blade. &ldquo;The clans have never been a
nation, but now he makes us one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will not help you turn him in this, Moiraine
Sedai,&rdquo; Amys added just as firmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may leave us now, Aes Sedai, if it pleases you,&rdquo;
Bair said. &ldquo;We have discussed what you wished to discuss as much as
we will tonight.&rdquo; It was politely said, but a dismissal all the
same.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will leave you,&rdquo; Moiraine replied, once again all
serenity. She sounded as though it were her suggestion, her
decision. By this time she was used to the Wise Ones making it
clear they were not under the Tower&rsquo;s authority. &ldquo;I have other
matters to see to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That much had to be the truth, of course. Very likely
something concerning Rand. Egwene knew better than to ask; if
Moiraine wanted her to know, she would tell her, and if not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;If not, she would be handed some slippery bit of Aes Sedai
avoidance of a lie, or else be told bluntly that it was none of her
business. Moiraine knew that &ldquo;Egwene Sedai of the Green Ajah&rdquo; was a
fraud. She tolerated the lie in public, but otherwise she let
Egwene know her proper place whenever it suited her.</p>

<p>As soon as Moiraine had gone, in a burst of cold air,
Amys said, &ldquo;Aviendha, pour the tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young Aiel woman gave a startled jerk, and her
mouth opened twice before she said faintly, &ldquo;I must brew it yet.&rdquo;
With that she scurried out of the tent on all fours. The second
blast from outside dimmed the steam.</p>

<p>The Wise Ones exchanged looks that were almost as
surprised as Aviendha&rsquo;s. And Egwene&rsquo;s; Aviendha always did even the
most onerous chores efficiently, if not always with a good grace.
Something must be troubling her greatly, to make her forget a thing
like making tea. The Wise Ones always wanted tea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More steam, girl,&rdquo; Melaine said.</p>

<p>That was her, Egwene realized, with Aviendha gone.
Hurriedly splashing more water on the rocks, she channeled to heat
the stones further, and the kettle, until she heard stones cracking
and the kettle itself radiated heat like a furnace. The Aiel might
be used to leaping from roasting in their own juices to freezing,
but she was not. Hot, thick clouds rolled up to fill the tent. Amys
nodded approvingly; she and Melaine could see the glow of <em>
saidar</em> surrounding her, of course, though she herself could
not. Melaine merely went on scraping with her <em>staera</em>.</p>

<p>Letting go of the True Source, she sat back and
leaned close to Bair to whisper, &ldquo;Has Aviendha done something very
wrong?&rdquo; She did not know how Aviendha would feel about it, but she
saw no reason to embarrass her, even behind her back.</p>

<p>Bair had no such compunctions. &ldquo;You mean her
stripes?&rdquo; she said in a normal voice. &ldquo;She came to me and said she
had lied twice today, though she would not say to whom or about
what. It was her own affair, of course, so long as she did not lie
to a Wise One, but she claimed her honor required that a <em>
toh</em> must be met.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She <em>asked</em> you to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Egwene gasped, but
could not finish.</p>

<p>Bair nodded as if it were not very much out of the
ordinary at all. &ldquo;I gave her a few extra for troubling me with it.
If <em>ji</em> was involved, her obligation is not to me. Very
likely her so-called lies were nothing anyone but a <em>Far Dareis
Mai</em> would worry about. Maidens, even former Maidens, are
sometimes as fussy as men.&rdquo; Amys gave her a flat look that was
plain even in the thick steam. Like Aviendha, Amys had been <em>Far
Dareis Mai</em> before becoming a Wise One.</p>

<p>Egwene had never met an Aiel who was not fussy about
<em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>, the way she saw it. But this! Aiel were all mad
as loons.</p>

<p>Apparently, Bair had already put the matter out of
her mind. &ldquo;There are more Lost Ones in the Three-fold Land than I
can ever remember before,&rdquo; she said to the tent at large. That was
what the Aiel had always called the Tinkers, the Tuatha&rsquo;an.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They flee the troubles beyond the Dragonwall.&rdquo; The
sneer in Melaine&rsquo;s voice was clear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard,&rdquo; Amys said slowly, &ldquo;that some of those
who run after the bleakness have gone to the Lost Ones and asked to
be taken in.&rdquo; A long silence followed. They knew now that the
Tuatha&rsquo;an had the same descent as themselves, that they had broken
away before the Aiel crossed the Spine of the World into the Waste,
but if anything the knowledge had only deepened their aversion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He brings change,&rdquo; Melaine whispered harshly into
the steam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you were reconciled to the changes he
brings,&rdquo; Egwene said, sympathy welling up in her voice. It must be
very hard to have your whole life stood on end. She half-expected
to be told to hold her tongue again, but no one did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reconciled,&rdquo; Bair said, as though tasting the word.
&ldquo;Better to say we endure them, as best we can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He transforms everything.&rdquo; Amys sounded troubled.
&ldquo;Rhuidean. The Lost Ones. The bleakness, and telling what should
not have been told.&rdquo; The Wise Ones&mdash;all the Aiel, for that
matter&mdash;still had difficulty speaking of that</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Maidens cluster about him as though they owe
more to him than to their own clans,&rdquo; Bair added. &ldquo;For the first
time ever, they have allowed a man beneath a Roof of the Maidens.&rdquo;
For a moment Amys looked about to say something, but whatever she
knew about the inner workings of <em>Far Dareis Mai</em> she shared
with no one but those who were or had been Maidens of the
Spear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The chiefs no longer listen to us as they did,&rdquo;
Melaine muttered. &ldquo;Oh, they ask our advice as always&mdash;they
have not become complete fools&mdash;but Bael will no longer tell
me what he has said to Rand al&rsquo;Thor, or Rand al&rsquo;Thor to him. He
says I must ask Rand al&rsquo;Thor, who tells me to ask Bael. The <em>
Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>, I can do nothing about, but Bael&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He has
always been a stubborn, infuriating man, yet now he is beyond all
bounds. Sometimes I want to thump his head with a stick.&rdquo; Amys and
Bair chuckled as if that were a fine joke. Or perhaps they just
wanted to laugh to forget the changes for a time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are only three things you can do with a man
like that,&rdquo; Bair chortled. &ldquo;Stay away from him, kill him, or marry
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Melaine stiffened, her sun-dark face going red. For a
moment Egwene thought the golden-haired Wise One was about to let
fly words hotter than her face. Then a biting gust announced
Aviendha&rsquo;s return carrying a worked silver tray holding a
yellow-glazed teapot, delicate cups of golden Sea Folk porcelain,
and a stone jar of honey.</p>

<p>She shivered as she poured&mdash;no doubt she had
not bothered to wrap anything around herself out there&mdash;and
hurriedly passed around the cups and the honey. She did not fill
cups for herself and Egwene until Amys told her she could, of
course.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More steam,&rdquo; Melaine said; the chill air seemed to
have cooled her temper. Aviendha set down her cup untouched and
scrambled for the gourd, plainly trying to make up for her lapse
with the tea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egwene,&rdquo; Amys said, sipping her tea, &ldquo;how would Rand
al&rsquo;Thor take it if Aviendha asked to sleep in his sleeping
chamber?&rdquo; Aviendha froze with the gourd in her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In his&mdash;?&rdquo; Egwene gasped. &ldquo;You cannot ask her
to do such a thing! You cannot!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fool girl,&rdquo; Bair muttered. &ldquo;We do not ask her to
share his blankets. But will he think that is what she asks? Will
he even allow it? Men are strange creatures at the best, and he was
not raised among us, so he is stranger still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He certainly would not think any such thing,&rdquo; Egwene
spluttered, then more slowly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he would. But it isn&rsquo;t
proper. It just isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ask that you not require this of me,&rdquo; Aviendha
said, sounding more humble than Egwene would have believed she
could. She was sprinkling water in jerky motions, sending up
increasing clouds of steam. &ldquo;I have been learning a great deal the
past days, not having to spend time with him. Since you have
allowed Egwene and Moiraine Sedai to help me with channeling, I
learn even faster. Not that they teach any better than you, of
course,&rdquo; she added hastily, &ldquo;but I want very much to learn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will still learn,&rdquo; Melaine told her. &ldquo;You will
not have to stay every hour with him. As long as you apply
yourself, your lessons will not be much slowed. You do not study
while you sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; Aviendha mumbled, head down over the
water gourd. More loudly, and more firmly, she added, &ldquo;I will not.&rdquo;
Her head came up, and her eyes were blue-green fire. &ldquo;I will not be
there when he summons that flip-skirt Isendre to his blankets
again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene gaped at her. &ldquo;Isendre!&rdquo; She had seen&mdash;and heartily disapproved of&mdash;the scandalous way the Maidens
kept the woman naked, but this! &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t really mean he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be silent!&rdquo; Bair snapped like a whip. Her blue-eyed
stare could have chipped stone. &ldquo;Both of you! You are both young,
but even the Maidens should know men can be fools, especially when
they are not attached to a woman who can guide them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; Amys said dryly, &ldquo;to see you no longer
hold your emotions so tightly, Aviendha. Maidens are as foolish as
men when it comes to that; I remember it well, and it embarrasses
me still. Letting emotions go clouds judgment for a moment, but
holding them in clouds it always. Just be sure you do not release
them too often, or when it is best to keep control of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Melaine leaned forward on her hands, until it seemed
the sweat dripping from her face must fall on the hot kettle. &ldquo;You
know your fate, Aviendha. You will be a Wise One of great strength
and great authority, and more besides. You already have a strength
in you. It saw you through your first test, and it will see you
through this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My honor,&rdquo; Aviendha said hoarsely, then swallowed,
unable to go on. She crouched there, huddling around the gourd as
if it contained the honor she wanted to protect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Pattern does not see <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>,&rdquo; Bair
told her, with only a hint of sympathy, if that. &ldquo;Only what must
and will be. Men and Maidens struggle against fate even when it is
clear the Pattern weaves on despite their struggles, but you are no
longer <em>Far Dareis Mai</em>. You must learn to ride fate. Only
by surrendering to the Pattern can you begin to have some control
over the course of your own life. If you fight, the Pattern will
still force you, and you will find only misery where you might have
found contentment instead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To Egwene, that sounded very much like what she had
been taught concerning the One Power. To control <em>saidar</em>,
you first had to surrender to it. Fight, and it would come wildly,
or overwhelm you; surrender and guide it gently, and it did as you
wished. But that did not explain why they wanted Aviendha to do
this thing. She asked as much, adding again, &ldquo;It is not
proper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instead of answering, Amys said, &ldquo;Will Rand al&rsquo;Thor
refuse to allow her? We cannot force him.&rdquo; Bair and Melaine were
looking at Egwene as intently as Amys.</p>

<p>They were not going to tell her why. It was easier to
make a stone talk than to get something out of a Wise One against
her will. Aviendha was studying her toes in sulky resignation; she
knew the Wise Ones would get what they wanted, one way or
another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Egwene said slowly. &ldquo;I do not know
him as well as I used to.&rdquo; She regretted that, but so much had
happened, quite aside from her realizing that she did not love him
as more than a brother. Her training, in the Tower as well as here,
had changed things just as much as him being who he had become. &ldquo;If
you give him a good reason, perhaps. I think he likes Aviendha.&rdquo;
The young Aiel woman heaved a heavy sigh without looking up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good reason,&rdquo; Bair snorted. &ldquo;When I was a girl,
any man would have been overjoyed to have a young woman show that
much interest in him. He would have gone to pick the flowers for
her bridal wreath himself.&rdquo; Aviendha started, and glared at the
Wise Ones with some of her old spirit. &ldquo;Well, we will find a reason
even someone raised in the wetlands can accept.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is several nights before your agreed meeting in
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>,&rdquo; Amys said. &ldquo;With Nynaeve, this
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That one could learn much,&rdquo; Bair put in, &ldquo;if she
were not so stubborn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your nights are free until then,&rdquo; Melaine said.
&ldquo;That is, unless you have been entering <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>
without us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene suspected what was coming. &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo;
she told them. It had only been a little. Any more than a little,
and they would find out for sure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you succeeded in finding either Nynaeve&rsquo;s or
Elayne&rsquo;s dreams?&rdquo; Amys asked. Casually, as if it were nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Amys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Finding someone else&rsquo;s dreams was a lot harder than
stepping into <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, the World of Dreams,
especially if they were any distance away. It was easier both the
closer they were and the better you knew them. The Wise Ones still
demanded that she not enter <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> without at
least one of them along, but someone else&rsquo;s dream was maybe just as
dangerous in its own way. In <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> she was in
control of herself and of things around her to a large degree,
unless one of the Wise Ones decided to take over; her command of
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> was increasing, but she still could not
match any of them, with their long experience. In another&rsquo;s dream,
though, you were a part of that dream; it took all you could muster
not to behave as the dreamer wanted, be as their dream took you,
and still sometimes it did not work. The Wise Ones had been very
careful when watching Rand&rsquo;s dreams never to enter fully. Even so
they insisted she learn. If they were to teach dreamwalking, they
meant to teach all that they knew of it.</p>

<p>She was not reluctant, exactly, but the few times
they had let her practice, with themselves and once with Rhuarc,
had been chastening experiences. The Wise Ones had some
considerable mastery over their own dreams, so what had happened
there&mdash;to show her the dangers, they said&mdash;had all been
their doing, but it had been a shock to learn that Rhuarc saw her
as a little more than a child, like his youngest daughters. And her
own control had wavered for one fatal moment. After that she had
been little more than a child; she still could not look at the man
without remembering being given a doll for studying hard. And being
as pleased with the gift as with his approval. Amys had had to come
and take her away from happy play with it. Amys knowing was bad
enough, but she suspected that Rhuarc remembered some of it,
too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must keep trying,&rdquo; Amys said. &ldquo;You have the
strength to reach them, even as far as they are. And it will do you
no harm to learn how they see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was not so sure of that herself. Elayne was a
friend, but Nynaeve had been Wisdom of Emond&rsquo;s Field for most of
her growing up. She suspected Nynaeve&rsquo;s dreams would be worse than
Rhuarc&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tonight I will sleep away from the tents,&rdquo; Amys went
on. &ldquo;Not far. You should be able to find me easily, if you try. If
I do not dream of you, we will speak of it in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene suppressed a groan. Amys had guided her to
Rhuarc&rsquo;s dreams&mdash;she herself had remained only an instant,
barely long enough to reveal that Rhuarc still saw her, unchanged,
as the young woman he had married&mdash;and the Wise Ones had
always been in the same tent before when she tried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Bair said, rubbing her hands, &ldquo;we have heard
what needed to be heard. The rest of you can remain if you wish,
but I feel clean enough to go to my blankets. I am not so young as
the rest of you.&rdquo; Young or not, she could probably run any of them
into the ground, then carry them the rest of the way.</p>

<p>As Bair was getting to her feet, Melaine spoke, and
strangely for her, she was hesitant. &ldquo;I need&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I must ask your
help, Bair. And you, Amys.&rdquo; The older woman settled back, and both
she and Amys looked at Melaine expectantly. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;would ask you
to approach Dorindha for me.&rdquo; The last words came out in a rush.
Amys smiled widely, and Bair cackled aloud. Aviendha seemed to
understand, too, and be startled, but Egwene was lost.</p>

<p>Then Bair laughed. &ldquo;You always said you did not need
a husband and did not want one. I have buried three, and would not
mind another. They are very useful when the night is cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A woman can change her mind.&rdquo; Melaine&rsquo;s voice was
firm enough, but belied by the deep flush in her cheeks. &ldquo;I cannot
stay away from Bael, and I cannot kill him. If Dorindha will accept
me as her sister-wife, I will make my bridal wreath to lay
at Bael&rsquo;s feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What if he steps on it instead of picking it up?&rdquo;
Bair wanted to know. Amys fell back, laughing and slapping her
thighs.</p>

<p>Egwene did not think there was much danger of that,
not the way Aiel customs ran. If Dorindha decided she wanted
Melaine for sister-wife, Bael would not have much say in the
matter. It no longer shocked her, precisely, that a man could have
two wives. Not exactly. <em>Different lands mean different
customs</em>, she reminded herself firmly. She had never been able
to bring herself to ask, but for all she knew, there might be Aiel
women with two husbands. They were very strange people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ask you to act as my first-sisters in this. I
think that Dorindha likes me well enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as Melaine spoke those words, the other
women&rsquo;s hilarity changed to something else. They still laughed, but
they hugged her and told her how happy they were for her, and how
well she would do with Bael. Amys and Bair, at least, took
Dorindha&rsquo;s acceptance for granted. The three of them departed all
but arm-in-arm, still laughing and giggling like girls. Not before
telling Egwene and Aviendha to straighten the tent, though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egwene, could a woman of your land accept a
sister-wife?&rdquo; Aviendha asked, using a stick to push the cover off
the smoke hole.</p>

<p>Egwene wished she had left that duty till last; the
heat began to dissipate immediately. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said,
quickly gathering the cups and the honey jar. The <em>staera</em>
went onto the tray, too. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. Maybe if it was a close
friend,&rdquo; she added hurriedly; there was no point in seeming to
denigrate Aiel ways.</p>

<p>Aviendha only grunted and began pushing up the side
flaps.</p>

<p>Teeth chattering as loudly as the rattle of teacups
and bronze blades on the tray, Egwene scurried outside. The Wise
Ones were dressing unhurriedly, as though this were a balmy night
and they in sleeping chambers in some hold. A white-robed figure,
pale in the moonlight, took the tray from her, and she quickly
began searching for her cloak and shoes. They were nowhere among
the remaining garments on the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had your things taken to your tent,&rdquo; Bair said,
tying the laces of her blouse. &ldquo;You will not need them yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene&rsquo;s stomach sank into her feet. Hopping in
place, she flapped her arms in a futile effort for warmth; at least
they did not tell her to stop. Abruptly she realized the
snowy-robed figure bearing the tray away was too tall for even an
Aiel woman. Gritting her teeth, she glared at the Wise Ones, who
seemed not to care if she froze to death jumping up and down. To
the Aiel women it might not matter that a man had seen them with no
clothes on, at least if he was <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>, but it did to
her!</p>

<p>In a moment, Aviendha joined them and, seeing her
leaping about, merely stood there without any effort to find her
own garments. She showed no more effect of the cold than the Wise
Ones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Bair said, settling her shawl on her
shoulders. &ldquo;You, Aviendha, are not only stubborn as a man, you
cannot remember a simple task you have done many times. You,
Egwene, are just as stubborn, and you still think you can linger in
your tent when you are summoned. Let us hope running fifty times
around the camp will temper your stubbornness, clear your minds,
and remind you of how to answer a summons or do a chore. Off with
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without a word, Aviendha immediately began loping
toward the edge of the camp, easily dodging dark shrouded tent
ropes. Egwene hesitated only a moment before following. The Aiel
woman kept her pace down so she could catch up. The night air froze
her, and the cracked stony clay underfoot was just as cold, and
tried to catch her toes besides. Aviendha ran with effortless
ease.</p>

<p>As they reached the last tent and turned southward,
Aviendha said, &ldquo;Do you know why I study so hard?&rdquo; Neither the cold
nor running had made an impression on her voice.</p>

<p>Egwene was shivering so hard she could barely speak.
&ldquo;No. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because Bair and the others always point to you, and
tell me how easily you learn, how you never have to have something
explained twice. They say I ought to be more like you.&rdquo; She gave
Egwene a sidelong glance, and Egwene found herself sharing a giggle
as they ran. &ldquo;That is part of the reason. The things I am learning
to do&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Aviendha shook her head, wonderment plain even by
moonlight. &ldquo;And the Power itself. I have never felt like that. So
alive. I can smell the faintest scent, feel the slightest stir in
the air.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is dangerous to hold on too long or too much,&rdquo;
Egwene said. Running did seem to warm her a little, though now and
again a shudder ran through her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you that, and I know
the Wise Ones have, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha merely sniffed. &ldquo;Do you think I would stab
my own foot with a spear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a time they ran in silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Rand really&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; Egwene said finally. The
cold had nothing to do with her difficulty getting the words out;
in fact, she was beginning to sweat again. &ldquo;I mean Isendre?&rdquo; She
could not make herself say it clearer than that.</p>

<p>At last Aviendha said slowly, &ldquo;I do not think that he
did.&rdquo; She sounded angry. &ldquo;But why would she ignore switchings if he
has shown no interest in her? She is a milk-hearted wetlander who
waits for men to come to her. I saw how he looked at her, though he
tried to hide it. He enjoyed looking at her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene wondered if her friend ever thought of her as
a milk-hearted wetlander. Probably not, or they would not be
friends. But Aviendha had never learned to worry if what she said
might hurt someone; she would probably be surprised to learn that
Egwene could even think of being hurt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The way the Maidens make her dress,&rdquo; Egwene admitted
reluctantly, &ldquo;any man would look.&rdquo; Reminded that she herself was in
the open without any clothes, she stumbled and almost fell as she
looked around anxiously. The night was empty as far as she could
make out. Even the Wise Ones were already back in their tents. Warm
in their blankets. She was sweating, but the beads seemed to want
to freeze as soon as they appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He belongs to Elayne,&rdquo; Aviendha said fiercely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I admit I don&rsquo;t know your customs fully, but ours
are not the same as yours. He is not betrothed to Elayne.&rdquo; <em>Why
am I defending him? He&rsquo;s the one who ought to be switched!</em> But
honesty made her go on. &ldquo;Even your Aiel men have the right to say
no, if they&rsquo;re asked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You and she are near-sisters, as you and I are,&rdquo;
Aviendha protested, slowing a step before picking it up again. &ldquo;Did
you not ask me to look after him for her? Do you not want her to
have him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I do. If he wants her.&rdquo; That was not
exactly true. She wanted Elayne to have what happiness she could,
in love with the Dragon Reborn as she was, and she would do
everything short of tying Rand hand and foot to see that Elayne got
what she wanted. Maybe not far short, at that, if need be.
Admitting it was another thing. Aiel women were far more forward
than she could ever make herself be. &ldquo;It would not be right,
otherwise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He belongs to her,&rdquo; Aviendha said determinedly.</p>

<p>Egwene sighed. Aviendha simply did not want to
understand any customs but her own. The Aiel woman was still
shocked that Elayne would not ask Rand to marry her, that a man
could ask that question. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure the Wise Ones will listen to
reason tomorrow. They can&rsquo;t make you sleep in a man&rsquo;s
bedchamber.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other woman looked at her in clear surprise. For
a moment her grace left her, and she stubbed a toe on the uneven
ground; the mishap brought a few curses that would have made even
Kadere&rsquo;s wagon drivers listen with interest&mdash;and made Bair
reach for the bluespine&mdash;but she did not stop running. &ldquo;I do
not understand why that upsets you so,&rdquo; she said when the last
curse died. &ldquo;I have slept next to a man many times on raids, even
sharing blankets for warmth if the night was very cold, but it
disturbs you that I will sleep within ten feet of him. Is this part
of your customs? I have noticed you will not bathe in the sweat
tent with men. Do you not trust Rand al&rsquo;Thor? Or is it me you do
not trust?&rdquo; Her voice had sunk to a concerned whisper by the
end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I trust you,&rdquo; Egwene protested heatedly.
&ldquo;And him. It&rsquo;s just that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She trailed off, uncertain how to
go on. Aiel notions of propriety were sometimes stricter than what
she had grown up with, but in other ways they would have had the
Women&rsquo;s Circle back home trying to decide whether to faint or reach
for a stout stick. &ldquo;Aviendha, if your honor is involved somehow&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; This was touchy ground. &ldquo;Surely if you explain to the Wise Ones,
they will not make you go against your honor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing to explain,&rdquo; the other woman said
flatly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know I don&rsquo;t understand <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;
Egwene began, and Aviendha laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say you do not understand, Aes Sedai, yet you
show that you live by it.&rdquo; Egwene regretted maintaining that lie
with her&mdash;it had been hard work to get Aviendha to call her
simply Egwene, and sometimes she slipped back&mdash;but it had to
be kept with everyone if it was to hold with anyone. &ldquo;You are Aes
Sedai, and strong enough in the Power to overcome Amys and Melaine
together,&rdquo; Aviendha continued, &ldquo;but you said that you would obey,
so you scrub pots when they say scrub pots, and you run when they
say run. You may not know <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>, but you follow
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not the same thing at all, of course. She
gritted her teeth and did as she was told because that was the only
way to learn dreamwalking, and she wanted to learn, to learn
everything, more than anything else she could imagine. To even
think that she could live by this foolish <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em> was
simply silly. She did what she had to do, and only when and because
she had to.</p>

<p>They were coming back to where they had begun. As her
foot hit the spot, Egwene said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one,&rdquo; and ran on through
the darkness with no one to see but Aviendha, no one to say whether
she went back to her tent right then. Aviendha would not have told,
but it never occurred to Egwene to stop short of the fifty.</p>
